Orchestrated historical briefing scene with Abbott Rodrigo González







Chapter 2.3: The Council's Burden
Basel, May 28, 1433 - Evening
The shadows lengthened across the merchant's study as Abbott Rodrigo González settled into the carved oak chair opposite you. The journey from the plaza to these lodgings had exhausted the old man more than he would admit—his breathing came in measured drafts, and he kept his gnarled hands folded in his lap to still their trembling.

But his eyes remained sharp as winter ice.

"Eight months," he began, his voice carrying the graveled authority of a man who had watched three popes come and go. "Eight months in this city, Your Majesty, and I confess I have learned more about the Church's ailments than I ever wished to know."

He gestured toward the window, where the spires of Basel's cathedral caught the dying light.

"The Council meets daily in that cathedral. Four deputations—Prelates, Doctors, Canons, and Lower Clergy—each with its own chamber, its own arguments, its own faction within factions. Bishop Alfonso sits in the Deputation of Prelates. Our theologians dominate many debates in the Doctors' chamber. We have positioned ourselves as the moderate voice, the bridge-builders. Cardinal Cesarini has consulted privately with Fray Hernando three times. Three times, Your Majesty. He values Castilian counsel."

The Abbott's expression darkened.

"But do not mistake our influence for control. The Council is a beast with many heads. The French delegation pushes for absolute conciliar supremacy—they would reduce the Pope to a figurehead, answerable to episcopal vote on every matter of doctrine. The Germans seek reform but fear French domination nearly as much as papal corruption. The Italians are divided between those loyal to Eugenius and those who believe the Papacy must be broken to be saved."

He leaned forward, lowering his voice though you were alone.

"And then there are the Bohemians. Two weeks ago, a delegation of moderate Hussites arrived to negotiate terms. They demand communion in both kinds, which we support. They demand vernacular preaching, which we support with proper oversight. But they also demand that their nobles keep the Church lands they seized during rebellion—lands stolen at swordpoint from abbeys and bishoprics. Millions of florins in property."

The Abbott's jaw tightened.

"This is where the Council stumbles, Your Majesty. The French say: grant everything, achieve peace. The Germans say: grant something, prevent war. The Italians say: grant nothing, maintain authority. And all of them dance around the property question because none wishes to offend Bohemian military power. Five crusades failed against their war wagons."

He studied your face with eyes that had watched empires crumble.

"Before I continue, I must know—what has Rome told you? What promises has Pope Eugenius extracted? And what in God's name did you say to those Byzantine metropolitans at the gates, that they now pace their lodgings like caged lions awaiting word from you?"

I want to talk with them at the earliest opportunity. But I wanted to talk with you first and learn where we stand. 

You say that we have influence and that there are relations with the other factions as well. 

How is the council progressing? They are meeting every day, but do they not just vote on issues and be done with it? Why does it take so long?

Excavated medieval council mechanics to illuminate procedural complexity



The Abbott let out a dry, humorless laugh that turned into a cough. He reached for the cup of watered wine on the table beside him, took a long sip, and shook his head.

"Vote and be done with it," he repeated, as if savoring the absurdity. "Your Majesty, if only it were so simple. The Council of Constance—where they burned Hus and ended the Great Schism—lasted four years. Four years of daily meetings, and they counted that as efficient."

He set down the cup with deliberate care.

"The process is thus: any matter of substance must first be debated in all four deputations separately. The Prelates discuss it among themselves. The Doctors argue the theological merits. The Canons examine canonical precedent. The Lower Clergy voice the practical concerns. Each deputation must reach internal consensus before the matter advances. Then it comes to general congregation—the full assembly—where all four deputations vote together. Only when three of four deputations agree does a decree pass."

The Abbott spread his hands.

"Consider what this means in practice. I wish to propose that simony be abolished. The Doctors agree immediately—it offends theology. The Lower Clergy agree—they suffer most from it. But the Prelates? Some of them purchased their offices. They delay, they raise procedural objections, they demand clarifications. The Canons argue about which historical precedents apply. Weeks pass. Months. A single reform decree can take half a year from first proposal to final vote."

He leaned back, his aged frame settling deeper into the chair.

"And that assumes goodwill. When factions actively oppose each other? The French block German proposals. The Germans retaliate. The Italians play both sides. Nothing moves forward. Meanwhile, Eugenius in Rome issues his own decrees, the Council issues counter-decrees, and Christendom watches two heads of the same body try to devour each other."

His voice grew quieter.

"We have passed some reforms. Decrees against pluralism—holding multiple benefices. Regulations on papal taxation. Procedures for future councils. Small victories, hard-won. But the great questions? Papal supremacy versus conciliar authority? The Hussite settlement? Constantinople's desperate plea for military aid? These matters have been debated for months with no resolution in sight."

The Abbott fixed you with his penetrating gaze.

"You ask where we stand. We stand respected but not feared. Consulted but not obeyed. Our delegation argues well, votes consistently, maintains our principles. But we are one voice among dozens. France has more bishops here than we do. The Germans have the Emperor's backing. We have moral authority from Granada—but moral authority does not move votes when self-interest speaks louder."

He paused, considering his next words carefully.

"What exactly do you hope to accomplish here, Your Majesty? In the weeks you have before you must return to Toledo?"

I have come to offer what help I can to the Byzantines. But I do not know their situation and thus I am unsure what I can actually offer. 

I have come to argue for papal supremacy, but I do not yet understand the dynamics of the situation here. 

I have come to hopefully end the hussite heresy and prevent theft of church property. But I have been warned about hussite military power and I want to heed that as well. 

I have been given the authority by the pope to speak on his behalf, but I am not informed yet about the situation.

Orchestrated Abbott's measured response to Juan's candid admissions and concerns




The Abbott was quiet for a long moment, his weathered fingers drumming slowly on the arm of his chair. When he finally spoke, his tone was measured—the careful words of a man choosing honesty over flattery.

"Four goals, Your Majesty. Each noble. Each fraught with complications you have not yet grasped."

He held up a gnarled finger.

"The Byzantines first, since you wish to meet them soonest. Metropolitan Bessarion and Metropolitan Isidore came to Basel because Constantinople is dying. The Ottomans tighten their grip. Emperor John VIII sent these men to beg—though they would never use that word—for Western military aid. They have been here for months, and the Council has given them nothing but theological debates about the Filioque clause and the nature of the Holy Spirit's procession. They are desperate, Your Majesty. And desperation makes men both grateful and suspicious. They remember 1204. They remember that the last time Latin armies came to 'help' Constantinople, those armies sacked the city and established a Latin emperor on the Byzantine throne. Whatever you offer them, they will wonder what you want in return."

A second finger.

"Papal supremacy. Your Majesty, you say you have come to argue for this, but you must understand—you stand in a Council that has already declared itself superior to the Pope. They invoke the decrees of Constance. They claim that a general council, representing the universal Church, holds authority over any individual, including the Bishop of Rome. The French delegation would cheer if Eugenius were deposed tomorrow. If you stand before this assembly and proclaim papal supremacy, you will not convince them. You will confirm their suspicion that you are the Pope's creature, sent to undermine their legitimate reforms. You will lose whatever influence Castile has built."

A third finger.

"The Hussites. Yes, you have been warned of their military power, and wisely so. But there is more. The moderate Hussites here at Basel—the Utraquists, they call themselves—are not the radicals. The radicals remain in Bohemia, suspicious of any negotiation. The moderates want peace. They want their reforms recognized. They are willing to compromise on some matters. But the Church property question is not theological for them—it is political. Bohemian nobles seized those lands. Those nobles now hold power in Bohemia. Any settlement that demands property return means those nobles lose power, which means civil war in Bohemia, which means the moderates here cannot deliver what they promise. You speak of ending heresy and preventing theft. Noble goals. But ending heresy requires Bohemian cooperation, and preventing theft requires Bohemian nobles to surrender their gains. These goals may be mutually exclusive."

The fourth finger.

"And finally—you say the Pope has given you authority to speak on his behalf. Your Majesty, forgive an old man's bluntness, but has he? I have seen no letter to the Council. No formal announcement. No papal bull declaring Juan of Castile as legate or representative. You have his blessing, yes. His trust, certainly. But when you stand before Cardinal Cesarini and the assembled fathers and claim to speak for Rome, they will ask: by what authority? A private conversation in the Vatican is not the same as formal appointment. If you overstate your mandate, you will be seen as presumptuous. If you understate it, you will be seen as powerless. Which role do you intend to play?"

The Abbott's expression softened slightly, though concern remained etched in every line of his face.

"I do not say these things to discourage you, Your Majesty. Your presence here matters. Granada's completion matters. But you have weeks, not months. You cannot solve what this Council has failed to solve in over a year. So I ask again, more precisely: of these four goals, which matters most? And what would success look like for you, knowing the constraints you face?"

I show him the papal decree and section four specifically. 

I am not an official papal legate, but I do speak with his blessing and support. This is all put in writing. 

I will meet with there Utraquists and see if I can settle them the matter theologically. If I can get them to back down, returning church property becomes a matter between the individual nobles and the church. They have just seized lands unjustly. Could this work do you think?

Has the council of Constance actually established consular supremacy? I am confused. I thought that this matter was not estrablished. Tell me. 

I will listen to the Byzantines first before saying anything. I want to hear their position.

Weighed theological strategy against political realities and historical precedent








The Abbott took the decree carefully, his aged eyes squinting at the Latin script in the fading light. He read Article Four slowly, lips moving slightly as he absorbed each phrase. When he finished, he set the document down with visible respect.

"This is more than I expected," he admitted. "His Holiness speaks of 'complete confidence' and 'apostolic blessing.' He declares your witness is testimony the Council fathers 'must hear.' This is not formal legation, no—but it is substantial. It gives you ground to stand upon."

He tapped the parchment thoughtfully.

"Show this to Cardinal Cesarini when you address the Council. Let him see the Fisherman's Ring seal with his own eyes. It will not make you the Pope's legate, but it will prove you are not merely some foreign king meddling in Church affairs. You speak with Rome's encouragement, if not Rome's formal authority. That distinction matters, and the Cardinal will appreciate it."

On the matter of the Hussites, the Abbott's expression grew more guarded.

"Your logic is sound in principle, Your Majesty. Separate the theology from the theft. Grant communion in both kinds—which Scripture supports—while refusing to legitimize seizure of Church lands. The Utraquists here might accept such terms. They are moderates. They want reconciliation."

He held up a cautionary hand.

"But consider: the Utraquist delegation does not speak for Bohemia. They speak to Bohemia. Behind them stand the nobles who hold actual power—men who seized abbeys and monasteries and now draw rents from those properties. These nobles sent the Utraquists to Basel not because they desire theological peace, but because they want their theft sanctified by Church agreement. If the Utraquists return to Prague with terms that say 'you have your communion, but you must return the lands,' those nobles will reject the settlement entirely. The moderates will be discredited. The radicals—the Taborites, who believe all Church property is an abomination—will gain strength."

The Abbott leaned forward.

"And there is another complication. The Hussites justify the seizures theologically. They cite evangelical poverty—Christ and His apostles owned nothing, therefore the Church should own nothing, therefore seizing Church wealth is restoring proper Christian practice. When you say 'this is theft,' they say 'this is reform.' You are not merely arguing property law. You are arguing ecclesiology. What is the Church? What should it own? What is its proper relationship to worldly wealth?"

He spread his hands.

"Can your approach work? Perhaps. If you can convince the Utraquists that evangelical poverty as a principle is compatible with respecting existing Church property—that reform means future simplicity, not retroactive seizure—you might thread the needle. But you would need to be extraordinarily persuasive. And even then, the Bohemian nobles must be compelled to return what they've taken. By whom? With what force? Emperor Sigismund has tried for fifteen years and failed."

The Abbott's expression shifted when you asked about Constance. He sat back, his voice taking on the tone of a teacher addressing a crucial misunderstanding.

"Ah. Now we come to the heart of it. You ask if Constance established conciliar supremacy. The answer is: they claimed to, and that claim is precisely what this entire crisis is about."

He began counting on his fingers.

"In 1415, with three rival popes each claiming legitimacy and Christendom torn apart, the Council of Constance issued a decree called Haec Sancta—'This Holy Council.' It declared, in language that could not be clearer, that the Council holds its authority directly from Christ. That everyone—everyone, including the Pope—is bound to obey the Council in matters of faith, ending schism, and Church reform. They used this decree to depose all three rival popes and elect Martin V, ending the Great Schism."

He held up a second finger.

"Then they issued Frequens, requiring that general councils meet regularly—first after five years, then seven, then every ten years perpetually. Pope Martin V accepted his election by the Council. He acknowledged Frequens and convened this Council of Basel according to its requirements."

The Abbott's voice grew more intense.

"But here is where ambiguity becomes crisis. Martin V never explicitly endorsed Haec Sancta as permanent constitutional law. He accepted it as an emergency measure to end schism—not as a permanent subordination of papal authority to conciliar vote. When he died and Eugenius succeeded him, Eugenius took the same view: Constance solved a crisis, it did not rewrite the Church's constitution. The Pope remains supreme in his proper sphere."

He gestured toward the window and the cathedral beyond.

"The Council fathers here invoke Haec Sancta as settled law. They say: Constance established our supremacy, the Pope must obey. Eugenius says: Constance was emergency measure, I am not bound by it. When he tried to dissolve this Council, they declared his dissolution invalid because Haec Sancta means they answer to no pope. When he summoned them to meet in Italy instead, they refused because Frequens says Basel was properly convened. They have even summoned him to appear before them—citing Constance's authority."

The Abbott's voice dropped.

"This is not settled law, Your Majesty. This is open constitutional war. Both sides cite Constance, both interpret it differently, and neither will yield. If you argue for papal supremacy, you argue against Haec Sancta. If you argue for conciliar authority, you argue against the Pope who just blessed your crusade. There is no neutral ground. There is only choosing which interpretation of Constance you support—and living with the enemies that choice creates."

Finally, regarding the Byzantines, the Abbott nodded with visible approval.

"Listening first is wise. Wiser than most Western lords manage. The Greeks have been lectured to for eight months about Latin theological superiority. They have been told their Filioque rejection is error, their liturgical practices are deficient, their entire Eastern tradition is somehow lesser. They are proud men representing an ancient empire, and they have been treated as supplicants come to beg correction."

He rose slowly from his chair, his joints protesting.

"Hear their fears before you offer solutions. Learn what they actually need—not what we assume they need. They may surprise you. They may also test you. Bessarion is brilliant, a scholar who thinks in systems. Isidore is more practical, more political. Both are desperate enough to make deals but proud enough to reject condescension."

The Abbott moved toward the door, then paused.

"One more thing, Your Majesty. When you meet them, remember: they did not come to Basel to become Latin. They came hoping to remain Orthodox while receiving Latin swords. Every word you speak, they will weigh for signs of forced conversion, of theological imperialism, of another Fourth Crusade. If you can convince them you want to save Constantinople, not Latinize it, you may find them more receptive than you expect."

He bowed stiffly.

"Shall I send word to Metropolitan Bessarion that you will receive them tomorrow? And would you prefer I attend, or would you meet them alone?"

Lets talk about the powers of the pope versus that of the council. 

There is no clear legal or even moral argument that is much better than the other in this matter. What will happen do you think if I say nothing about this and just let the council decide for itself? Can this council elect a new pope? The last council clearly did and could this council not do so again? What do you think will happen?

14 nov 2025

Weighed ecclesiastical precedent against political realities and neutrality risks




The Abbott had been reaching for the door handle. Your question stopped him mid-motion. He turned back, and something in his expression shifted—a sharpening of focus, as if you had finally asked the question he had been waiting for.

He returned to his chair, lowering himself with renewed purpose.

"Now you are thinking like a king who understands what is truly at stake."

He was quiet for a moment, gathering his thoughts.

"Can this Council elect a new pope? Legally, canonically, by precedent—yes. Constance did so. They deposed three rival popes and elected Martin. If Basel declares Eugenius deposed for contumacy—for refusing to submit to conciliar authority—and elects a new pope, they have Constance as their precedent. They would say they are not innovating. They are following established procedure."

The Abbott's voice grew heavy.

"And Your Majesty, there are fathers here who want exactly that. The French delegation would celebrate. Cardinal Louis Aleman—who presides when Cesarini is absent—is a fierce conciliarist who believes Eugenius is a tyrant. Some Germans support deposition as the only way to force reform. Even some Italians who despise Eugenius personally would accept a new pope if it meant ending this paralysis."

He leaned forward, his aged eyes burning with intensity.

"But consider what happens if they do. Eugenius will not accept deposition. He will remain in Rome, claiming he is the true pope. He has loyal cardinals—twenty-three signed your decree, yes? Those cardinals will not recognize Basel's pope. You will have two popes again. Not three as in the Great Schism, but two. And this time, one will be elected by a Council that claims supreme authority, the other will be the sitting pontiff who claims councils cannot depose him. Christendom will split. Every kingdom, every diocese, every monastery will have to choose: Basel's pope or Rome's pope. Another schism, Your Majesty. Perhaps worse than the last."

The Abbott's hands gripped the chair arms.

"You ask what happens if you say nothing and let the Council decide. I will tell you what happens. Your silence will be interpreted. The French will say: 'Castile does not oppose us, therefore Castile accepts conciliar supremacy.' The papal loyalists will say: 'Castile received the Pope's blessing and now abandons him—they are cowards or traitors.' Cardinal Cesarini will wonder why the king who returned the crusade treasury and received perpetual grants from Eugenius suddenly has no opinion on whether Eugenius should remain pope."

He stood again, too agitated now to remain seated.

"And there is more. You carry that decree. Article Five declares an alliance between Rome and Castile founded in shared faith. If this Council deposes Eugenius and you have said nothing to defend him, what is that alliance worth? What does your word mean? You accepted his grants—the Military Orders in perpetuity, his support for Alfonso's Naples claim, his letters of blessing. You took everything he offered. And when his enemies moved to destroy him, you stood silent?"

The Abbott's voice softened, but his words remained sharp.

"Your Majesty, I understand the appeal of neutrality. You wish to avoid making enemies. You wish to focus on Hussites and Byzantines, matters where you see clear moral ground. But this Council's central question—who rules the Church, Pope or Council—is not a side issue you can avoid. It is the issue. Everything else flows from it. If the Council is supreme, they can negotiate with Hussites however they wish, regardless of papal objection. If the Pope is supreme, Basel's decrees mean nothing without his approval. Your other goals cannot be separated from this constitutional crisis."

He moved to the window, staring out at the cathedral spire.

"I do not tell you that you must argue for absolute papal supremacy. That would indeed make enemies here. But silence is not neutrality—it is abandonment of the man who just gave you everything you asked for. There are positions between 'the Pope is absolute monarch' and 'the Council can depose him at will.' Perhaps the path is arguing that both Pope and Council have proper spheres—that reform requires cooperation, not domination. That Basel's legitimate reforms deserve papal approval, and the Pope's legitimate authority deserves conciliar respect. A middle way."

He turned back to face you.

"But even that middle way requires you to speak. To say clearly: 'I do not support deposing Eugenius. I do not support schism. I support reform through reconciliation, not revolution.' Can you say that much, at least? Or will you truly stand silent while they decide whether to tear the Church in two?"

If I adopt the following position: 

I am not a church member, I am a king who seeks to be a good Christian and I am here primarily to see how I as a king can help our brothers in faith in Constantinople. Winning wars is after all not a matter of theology but of warfare. I don't know the former but do know the latter. 

My faith and grants from the vatican are well-known; they allowed me to finish the reconquuista and God willing I continue my work in service of god fighting the Ottomans. When the church is divided, this becomes very difficult. 

On matters regarding reform, my delegation is very clear and I hope their arguments have found root. Regarding the important issue of concilliar supremacy, I cannot argue either way on legal grounds. It is not my task or responsibility to do so. I do benefit greatly from a united church and this is my appeal to this council. Reform on it's merits and try to seperate the issue of reform from supremacy. Please find a way to stay united somehow. The church's flock needs a unified church, not another scism. 

What do you think father? Would this work?

Analyzed diplomatic strategy against NPC realism framework, constructed reaction table














The Abbott listened carefully, his expression unreadable as you laid out your proposed position. When you finished, he remained silent for a long moment, his fingers steepled beneath his chin.

ABBOTT RODRIGO'S REACTION TO PROPOSED POSITION

Success Factors (persist regardless of roll):

Appeal for unity is genuine and resonates with Abbott's deepest concerns
Focus on Constantinople gives clear, non-controversial purpose
Acknowledges papal relationship honestly without claiming to be legate
Maintains appropriate humility about theological competence
References delegation's reform work, showing he trusts their judgment
Failure Factors (persist regardless of roll):

Juan is NOT "just a king" - he carries papal decree, formed alliance, accepted perpetual grants
"I'm not a churchman" rings hollow when he holds document with Fisherman's Ring seal
Separating reform from supremacy is what Council has failed to do for 14 months
Abbott just spent significant time explaining why silence equals abandonment
Position is essentially sophisticated neutrality on the central question
Other delegations will see through this evasion immediately
French will interpret as: "He knows we're right but won't say it"
Papal loyalists will interpret as: "He takes Pope's gifts then refuses to defend Pope"
Cardinal Cesarini values Castilian clarity - this offers only evasion
D100 TABLE: ABBOTT'S ASSESSMENT

Roll	Result
1-15	Deeply Disappointed - Sees this as moral cowardice; bluntly says Juan is trying to keep papal benefits while avoiding papal obligations; warns this will destroy Castilian credibility at Basel and in Rome
16-30	Concerned Rebuke - Points out the logical contradiction forcefully; "you cannot carry that decree and claim to be an outsider"; worried Juan doesn't understand the stakes
31-45	Skeptical but Patient - Sees the appeal's merits but systematically dismantles the "I'm just a king" pretense; asks hard questions about what Juan owes Eugenius
46-60	Troubled Acknowledgment - Admits the unity appeal has power but insists the evasion on supremacy will be seen through; suggests modifications to make position tenable
61-75	Cautious Respect - Sees strategic wisdom in focusing on Constantinople but still presses on the silence problem; offers specific ways to strengthen the position
76-85	Thoughtful Engagement - Finds more merit than expected in the "outsider warrior" framing; works with Juan to refine approach while noting remaining vulnerabilities
86-95	Surprised Agreement - Recognizes that claiming incompetence on theology might actually be the most honest position; helps craft language that makes this work
96-100	Genuine Admiration - Sees profound wisdom in refusing to play theological games Juan cannot win; enthusiastically helps develop the approach with only minor concerns
Shall I roll?

Calibrated diplomatic response acknowledging merit while dismantling strategic vulnerabilities





The Abbott exhaled slowly, his expression caught between acknowledgment and concern.

"The unity appeal has power, Your Majesty. Genuine power. When you speak of the flock needing a unified Church, when you frame yourself as the warrior who needs a united Christendom to fight the Ottomans—that will resonate. Men here are weary of schism. They remember the chaos of three popes. They do not want to repeat it."

He moved back to his chair, sitting heavily.

"And focusing on Constantinople is strategically sound. It gives you purpose beyond the constitutional debate. No one can accuse you of meddling in theology when you speak of saving Christian brothers from Turkish swords. That part works."

His tone sharpened.

"But Your Majesty, you cannot stand before this Council holding that document"—he gestured to the papal decree on the table—"and claim to be merely a king with no stake in Church matters. You carry the Fisherman's Ring seal. Article Five declares an alliance between Rome and Castile founded in shared faith. Article Four says you come with papal blessing to remind the Council fathers what their debates truly concern. You accepted perpetual grants that bind all future popes. You are entangled in Church matters, by your own choice and the Pope's explicit favor."

The Abbott leaned forward intently.

"When you say 'I cannot argue either way on legal grounds,' the French will hear: 'He knows we are right but fears to say it.' When you say 'it is not my task to decide,' Cardinal Cesarini will wonder why the Pope trusted you if you refuse to defend him. When you plead for unity without stating what unity means, both sides will claim you for their own or dismiss you as a coward."

He softened slightly.

"There is a path here. But it requires you to say something about the supremacy question—not as a theologian, but as a faithful king. You need not declare the Pope absolute monarch over all councils. But you must say clearly: 'I do not support deposing Eugenius. I do not support electing a rival pope. I support reform through cooperation, not through schism.' That much, at least, you owe the man who gave you those grants."

He studied your face.

"Can you say that much? That you oppose deposition and schism, even if you claim no competence on the finer legal questions?"

Just theoretically abott, what if I support the conciliarists? I have recieved support, yes, but I could say that my judgement based on moral and judicial grounds are seperated from any help I have recieved. 

What support does the pope have left? If we support the church and the council as supreme, would they start a new election? possibly elect pope Eugenius then, now using council election mechanics?

14 nov 2025

Examined moral hazards and political naivety of proposed betrayal







The Abbott's face went very still. For a long moment, he said nothing, his eyes fixed on you with an expression that mixed alarm with something approaching disbelief.

"Your Majesty," he said finally, his voice quiet but carrying an edge you had not heard before, "do you hear what you are proposing?"

He rose from his chair with more energy than his aged frame usually permitted.

"You would stand before Christendom and say: 'Three days ago I knelt before Pope Eugenius, kissed his ring, accepted his perpetual grants, formed an alliance sealed with the Fisherman's Ring, and received his complete trust. Now I declare that councils are supreme over popes and by extension support his potential deposition.' And you believe you can separate your judgment from the help you received?"

The Abbott's voice grew harder.

"No one will believe that separation, Your Majesty, because it is not believable. It is sophistry. You accepted the grants. You carry the decree in your saddlebag. You gave the Pope your word—not explicit perhaps, but implicit in every action. When a man kneels before the Pope and accepts his blessing, he does not then support those who would depose him. Not three days later. Not ever."

He began pacing, his robes swishing against the floor.

"And your question about re-election reveals you do not understand what is happening here. The conciliarists do not wish to depose Eugenius and then re-elect him under their authority. That gains them nothing. They want to break papal resistance to conciliar supremacy. If they depose Eugenius, they will elect someone who accepts that councils are supreme—who will sign whatever they place before him, who will be their creature. Cardinal Louis Aleman perhaps, or another who shares their views."

The Abbott stopped pacing and faced you directly.

"Eugenius will not accept deposition. He will remain in Rome claiming legitimacy. His loyal cardinals—those twenty-three who signed your decree—will not recognize Basel's pope. You will have schism. Two popes, two obediences, Christendom split in two. And you, King of Castile, will be known as the man who betrayed the Pope who blessed his crusade. The man whose word means nothing. The man who took everything Rome offered and then stabbed Rome in the back."

His voice softened slightly, but his gaze remained intense.

"What support does Eugenius have left? More than you might think. He has the Papal States, however embattled. He has loyal Italian cardinals. He has the legitimacy of succession from Martin V. He has England's cautious support. He has the Iberian kingdoms—Portugal, Aragon, and until this moment, Castile. If you abandon him, you encourage others to do the same. You weaken him precisely when your alliance was meant to strengthen him."

The Abbott moved closer, lowering his voice.

"Your Majesty, I must ask—what is driving this thinking? Three days ago you wept before Eugenius, begging him to protect your faith in the Church's purity. Now you contemplate supporting those who would depose him? Is this strategy, or is this fear of the harder path? Because if you support the conciliarists to avoid conflict, you will create far greater conflict. And you will have destroyed something precious—your reputation as a man whose word can be trusted, whose oaths mean something, whose faith is genuine rather than convenient."

He stepped back.

"You asked what I think. I think this path leads to dishonor. I think it leads to schism. I think it makes you an oath-breaker in the eyes of Christendom. And I think, Your Majesty, that you already know this, which is why you framed it as 'theoretical.' Some theories should remain theoretical."

I hope I do understand a bit about the situation here father. I was only asking the question hypothetically to grasp the adges of papal control and support. 

But what I do not yet understand is this; this council has been adopting measures about many things already. About clergy having only one title at max. Does the pope recognize these measures?

14 nov 2025

Examined papal authority disputes over Council reform decrees






The Abbott's expression shifted from alarm to something more measured. He nodded slowly, seeming to understand that you were probing the edges of a complex situation rather than truly contemplating betrayal.

"Ah. Now that is the question that reveals the full absurdity of where we stand."

He settled back into his chair, his tone becoming more instructive.

"The answer is: no. And yes. And it depends on who you ask."

He held up a hand before you could respond.

"The Council has passed reform decrees, yes. Measures against pluralism—holding multiple benefices. Regulations on papal taxation of national churches. Procedures requiring future councils to meet regularly. These decrees were voted upon properly, approved by three of four deputations, proclaimed in general congregation. By the Council's own authority—which they claim from Constance's Haec Sancta—these are now binding law of the Church."

His voice took on a sardonic edge.

"But Eugenius has not approved them. He has not signed them. He has not issued papal bulls confirming them. He cannot, because doing so would acknowledge the Council's authority to legislate without his approval. If he signs their decrees, he admits they have power to bind the Church. If he refuses to sign, he can claim the decrees are invalid without papal confirmation."

The Abbott spread his hands.

"So we have reform decrees that the Council says are law and the Pope says are proposals awaiting his approval. Bishops return to their dioceses uncertain whether they must obey Basel's rules on benefices or whether they can ignore them pending papal confirmation. Abbots wonder if the taxation reforms apply or not. The entire Church exists in legal chaos because no one knows whose authority is valid."

He leaned forward.

"This is precisely why the supremacy question cannot be separated from reform. Every reform decree Basel passes is only as valid as Basel's authority to pass it. If the Pope is supreme, these decrees mean nothing until he approves them. If the Council is supreme, they are already binding law. The two questions are inseparable, Your Majesty. You cannot support the reforms without implicitly supporting the authority that enacted them."

His eyes narrowed thoughtfully.

"There is a path out of this tangle. If Eugenius and the Council reconciled—if he acknowledged the Council as legitimate and they acknowledged his approval was needed for decrees to bind—then both authorities would be preserved. Reform would proceed with proper sanction. But that reconciliation requires someone to bridge the gap. Someone both sides might trust."

He let that implication hang in the air.

So I would advocate for the pope to sign these laws into force and this would be the new procedure? The council debates and accepts laws and the pope signs them into law? 

But would this not create a stalemate? What if the pope never confirms anything the council proposes?

Weighed constitutional tensions between papal veto power and conciliar authority





The Abbott's weathered face creased into something almost like a smile—the expression of a teacher whose student has finally grasped the difficulty of the problem.

"Now you see it, Your Majesty. Now you understand why this Council has raged for over a year with no resolution."

He nodded slowly, his approval evident.

"Yes, that is precisely the danger. If the Pope must confirm all decrees, he becomes a veto. He can refuse any reform he dislikes, claiming it exceeds proper conciliar authority. The Council passes measures against simony—the Pope refuses to sign because the language threatens papal revenue. The Council limits multiple benefices—the Pope delays indefinitely because it affects curial appointments. Nothing changes. The conciliarists' nightmare."

He held up a finger.

"But reverse it. If the Council can legislate without papal approval, the Pope becomes a figurehead. They pass whatever they wish. They strip papal authority piece by piece. They rewrite Church governance to their liking. The Pope's nightmare. And likely schism, because no pope will accept being reduced to a ceremonial bishop who signs whatever Basel demands."

The Abbott rose and moved to the window, gazing out at the darkening sky.

"This is why both sides fight so fiercely over supremacy. Neither trusts the other with final authority. And truthfully? Perhaps neither should be trusted with absolute power. Popes have been corrupt—selling offices, living in luxury while preaching poverty, ignoring genuine calls for reform. But councils have been dangerous too—Constance burned Jan Hus despite his safe conduct, and many here would burn more if given the chance."

He turned back to face you.

"The only path through this impasse is mutual trust, which does not exist. The Pope would need to trust that the Council will reform genuine abuses rather than strip his legitimate authority. The Council would need to trust that the Pope will approve genuine reforms rather than veto everything that threatens his power."

His voice grew more intent.

"Someone must build that trust, Your Majesty. Someone must convince both sides that cooperation serves them better than conflict. That the Pope approving conciliar reforms strengthens rather than weakens him—because it shows he supports genuine reform and is not the tyrant they claim. That the Council seeking papal approval strengthens rather than weakens them—because it gives their reforms legitimacy that unilateral action cannot."

He returned to his chair.

"This is where your position might actually serve. Not arguing for papal supremacy, not arguing for conciliar supremacy, but arguing for cooperation. You could say: 'I am a king who rules with my Cortes. I propose laws, they debate them, we find agreement. Neither I nor they have absolute power, and this makes Castile stronger, not weaker. Perhaps Pope and Council might find similar accommodation.'"

The Abbott paused.

"But I warn you—this middle path has few friends. The French want clear conciliar victory. Papal loyalists want clear papal victory. Men who preach compromise are often despised by both sides as either cowards or traitors. Are you prepared for that?"

I think I will argue for reform first. Reform under a temporary procedure. I will advocate that the pope signs these new measures if they also bear his approval. Hopefully this creates some space and trust moving forward. 

What do you think?

14 nov 2025

Weighed compromise's merits against practical implementation obstacles








The Abbott considered your words carefully, his fingers drumming a slow rhythm on the chair arm. When he spoke, his tone was measured—neither dismissive nor enthusiastic.

"There is wisdom here, Your Majesty. Real wisdom. You avoid the trap of declaring supremacy while still advocating for papal involvement. 'Temporary procedure' sidesteps the permanent constitutional question. And focusing on reform first gives you common ground—everyone here claims to want reform, whatever their true motives."

He held up a cautionary hand.

"But the devil, as always, lurks in the details. Let me pose the questions that will be thrown at you immediately."

He began counting on his fingers.

"First: the Council has already passed reform decrees. On pluralism. On papal taxation. On future council procedures. They consider these valid law, enacted under their Constance authority. Will you ask them to re-submit these decrees for papal approval? They will see that as surrender—admitting their previous actions were invalid without the Pope's signature. The French will refuse outright."

A second finger.

"Second: what does 'temporary' mean? Six months? A year? Until the supremacy question is resolved? If you cannot define the timeframe, both sides will assume the worst. The Pope will think you're trapping him into permanent subordination. The Council will think you're buying time for papal resistance."

A third finger.

"Third: you say the Pope signs measures 'if they also bear his approval.' What happens when he disapproves? The Council passes a decree limiting papal revenue from annates. The Pope refuses to sign. Is the decree dead? Does the Council revise it? Who decides if his objection is legitimate concern or obstruction? You have not solved the stalemate—you have merely delayed it."

The Abbott leaned back, his expression thoughtful rather than critical.

"And fourth: who proposes this procedure to the Pope? You have his trust, yes. But you are here in Basel. He is in Rome. Do you send a letter suggesting he submit to conciliar authority, even temporarily? How will that letter read to a Pope already feeling besieged?"

He was quiet for a moment.

"I do not say your idea is wrong, Your Majesty. I say it is incomplete. If you stand before the Council and propose this, you must have answers to these questions. Otherwise, you will be seen as naive—a well-meaning king who does not understand Church politics."

His eyes met yours.

"Tell me: when you say the Pope signs measures that 'bear his approval,' do you mean he can reject any decree he dislikes? Or do you mean something else? And what do you propose for the decrees the Council has already passed?"

And I have answers to these questions, yes. 
1. I will ask the pope to sign exactly the same law. This way, neither side is supreme over the other. We all want reform and we should find common cause instead of grounds of division. 
2. Temporary for these laws only. Nothing more. Meaning that this does not create precedent or time pressure. Both sides want reform and are worried that the method of enacting it will diminish their power. We must instead focus on the matters at hand. 
3. If the pope disapproves we are exactly where we are right now. In the stalemate of differing jurisdictions. 
4. I will propose it, using the best measures available to me.

14 nov 2025

Weighed Juan's diplomatic proposal against entrenched institutional resistance








The Abbott listened to each answer, his expression shifting from skepticism to grudging respect as you laid out your reasoning. When you finished, he nodded slowly.

"You have thought on this more carefully than I credited, Your Majesty. The framing is clever—asking the Pope to sign exactly the same laws avoids the humiliation of resubmission. Neither side surrenders. Both claim they enacted reform. That has elegance."

He drummed his fingers thoughtfully.

"And 'temporary for these laws only' sidesteps the precedent question. You are not proposing permanent constitutional settlement. You are proposing practical solution for immediate reforms. That may appeal to moderates weary of theoretical warfare."

His expression grew more serious.

"But Your Majesty, there are two gaps in your thinking that will be exploited immediately."

He leaned forward.

"First: the Council fathers here believe their decrees are already valid law. They were properly debated, properly voted, properly proclaimed. From their view, asking the Pope to sign them is asking him to acknowledge what is already true, not to make them true. You frame it as cooperation. They will frame it as: 'Why should we seek approval for what we have already lawfully enacted?' The French especially will resist anything that implies their previous actions lacked validity."

He held up a second finger.

"Second, and more critical: you propose this for current reforms only. But what of future reforms? The Council is not finished. They have months, perhaps years, of work ahead. If your temporary procedure applies only to current decrees, what happens when they pass new measures next month? Do those require papal signature? If yes, you have created permanent procedure despite calling it temporary. If no, you have solved nothing—the supremacy question remains for all future legislation."

The Abbott's eyes narrowed.

"The Council will ask you directly: 'King of Castile, you propose the Pope sign our current reforms. Do you propose he must sign all future reforms as well?' How do you answer that question?"

The whole principle is that the council does not ask for approval at all. If the pope passes exactly the same law, it unites the church without establishing a procedure where the council asks the pope for permission. If anything, it reduces papal authority since they adopt exactly the council law, but I see no way around this, especially if I myself actually support these measures.
The reason we are in this mess is because people conflate right procedure to enact reform. The church desperately needs reform. Solve this first and this makes the question of authority much less painful for both sides. We still need to establish good procedure, we do. My argument is that doing so becomes easier once critical reforms have passed.
14 nov 2025

Weighed intellectual merit against practical implementation obstacles








The Abbott's eyebrows rose slightly at your first point. He sat back in his chair, regarding you with newfound assessment.

"Now that is a distinction worth making, Your Majesty. The Pope does not approve the Council's law. The Pope passes his own law that happens to be identical. Two authorities enacting the same reform independently. Neither asks permission of the other. Neither claims supremacy. Both claim credit for reform."

He stroked his beard thoughtfully.

"It is clever. Perhaps too clever—some will see through the fiction immediately. But the fiction may be exactly what both sides need. A way to cooperate without admitting cooperation. A way to retreat from their positions without appearing to retreat."

His expression sharpened.

"But you admit it yourself—this reduces papal authority. You are asking Eugenius to enact whatever the Council passes, word for word. Even if he does so 'independently,' everyone will know he is following their lead. He becomes the one who signs what they write. That is a bitter draught for a Pope already feeling besieged. Have you considered how you will convince him to accept this?"

The Abbott rose and moved to the table where your papal decree lay.

"You carry his complete trust. You formed an alliance with him. You wept together about defending the Church. Now you will write to him—or perhaps visit him again?—and say: 'Holy Father, I propose you enact whatever Basel passes, exactly as they write it.' How do you imagine he will receive that counsel?"

He turned back to you.

"Your second point about solving reform first to ease procedural conflict—yes, there is logic there. Demonstrate cooperation works before demanding permanent settlement. But Your Majesty, time presses. How long before the Council passes new decrees? How long before the supremacy question forces itself back to the fore? You speak of making things easier. The conciliarists speak of deposing Eugenius now, while their momentum holds. They will not wait for your gradual trust-building."

The Abbott's voice grew more direct.

"If you truly mean to propose this, you must move quickly. Speak to Cardinal Cesarini—he is the moderate who might champion such compromise. Speak to the Byzantine delegation—Constantinople's crisis might unite factions around common cause. And most importantly, you must know whether Eugenius will accept your proposal before you publicly champion it. Otherwise you promise what you cannot deliver."

He fixed you with his penetrating gaze.

"When do you intend to make this proposal? And to whom do you speak first—the Council, or the Pope?"

I understand father. But this is just doing honest work. I do not know how to convince the pope of anything. I can only try. And I cannot do it right now for sure. 

Finally, I must ask if there has been discussions or proposals regarding a new pope by the council. And if so, what procedure did they propose?

14 nov 2025

Investigated historical Council proceedings regarding papal succession protocols




The Abbott's expression grew grave. He moved back to his chair and sat slowly, as if the weight of the question pressed upon him.

"You ask about papal election discussions. Yes, Your Majesty. There have been such discussions, though not yet formal procedures."

He folded his hands carefully.

"In February of this year—just three months past—the Council issued a formal summons to Pope Eugenius. They commanded him to appear before them within sixty days to answer charges of contumacy. Contumacy, Your Majesty—willful disobedience to legitimate authority. They treat him as an accused criminal, not as Supreme Pontiff."

The Abbott's voice hardened.

"When the sixty days passed and Eugenius did not appear—could not appear, for to do so would acknowledge their authority to summon him—the radicals began pushing for formal proceedings. Cardinal Louis Aleman, the Archbishop of Arles, leads this faction. He argues that if Eugenius refuses to submit to conciliar authority, he proves himself a tyrant and heretic against the decrees of Constance. Such a pope, Aleman claims, must be deposed."

He held up a hand.

"They have not yet begun formal deposition proceedings. The moderates—Cardinal Cesarini chief among them—have held them back. Cesarini still hopes for reconciliation. He negotiated that compromise with Eugenius last August, where the Pope acknowledged the Council's legitimacy while the Council softened its supremacy claims. A fragile peace."

The Abbott's eyes met yours.

"But that peace frays daily. Every week the radicals grow bolder. Every week Eugenius's refusal to cooperate feeds their arguments. If they do move to formal deposition, they would follow Constance's precedent: formal charges presented, trial conducted by the Council fathers, vote on removal, and then conclave to elect successor—but a conclave controlled by the Council itself, not the cardinals in Rome."

He leaned forward intently.

"Your Majesty, you arrive at a moment of balance. The radicals lack quite enough support for deposition—yet. The moderates hold the line—barely. Your voice, your presence, your authority from Granada's completion—these things have weight. If you speak for cooperation and reconciliation, you strengthen the moderates. If you remain silent or equivocate, the radicals will claim you fear to oppose them."

His voice dropped lower.

"Emperor Sigismund arrives in Rome for coronation in three days. After that, he comes here—perhaps by late June or July. He too seeks to prevent schism. If you and he speak with one voice for reconciliation, you may tip the balance. But if you wait too long, the radicals may force the question before you can act."

Thank you father. I know I have asked much of you. Thank you for your insight and knowledge. 

What time is it now?

14 nov 2025

Established evening timeline after lengthy theological discourse





The Abbott glanced toward the window. The last light of day had faded entirely while you spoke, and the room was now lit only by the guttering candles on the table. The spires of Basel's cathedral had become dark silhouettes against a purple-black sky.

"Past Compline, Your Majesty. Perhaps nine of the clock, or near to it."

He rose stiffly from his chair, and you noticed how heavily the conversation had weighed on him. His seventy-three years showed more clearly now—the tremor in his hands more pronounced, the lines of his face deeper in the candlelight.

"We have talked for hours. My old bones protest, and you have had a long journey." He offered a weary but genuine smile. "You have learned more of Basel's complexities in one evening than many delegates grasp in months. That speaks well of your mind, Your Majesty."

He moved toward the door, then paused.

"The Byzantine metropolitans will be anxious for your answer. Brother Guillem's message will have bought you time, but not much. They have waited months for someone to take their plea seriously. If you mean to meet them tomorrow, I would suggest morning—their patience runs thin, and making them wait longer may be taken as insult rather than discretion."

The Abbott bowed, his joints creaking audibly.

"I am lodged at the Augustinian house near the cathedral. Send word if you need me. And Your Majesty—" he fixed you with one last penetrating look, "—pray on what we have discussed tonight. Fray Hernando gave you three questions. I add a fourth: What does Castile's honor require of you here? Not what is strategically wise, but what is right."

He opened the door, letting in the cool night air of Basel.

"God grant you wisdom, and your Queen safe delivery. Good night, Your Majesty."

GM: The three questions the Fray gave me were during confession. There is no way the abott can know about them. We will continue as if he did not mention them. 

I go to sleep and the next morning, I visit the cathedral immediately early.

Reconciled narrative continuity and staged morning cathedral scene




May 29, 1433 — Early Morning
Sleep came fitfully. The merchant's bed was comfortable enough—better than many you'd known on campaign—but your mind churned through the Abbott's words long after you closed your eyes. Papal authority, conciliar supremacy, reform procedures, Byzantine desperation, Hussite defiance. Each thread tangled with the others until the whole tapestry seemed impossible to unravel.

Somewhere in the small hours, you dreamed of Isabel. She stood in the Toledo Cathedral, one hand resting on her swollen belly, the other reaching toward you. But the distance between you stretched impossibly, and no matter how fast you walked, she remained beyond your grasp.

You woke before dawn, throat dry.

The streets of Basel lay quiet as you made your way toward the cathedral. Mist rose from the Rhine, threading between buildings like ghostly fingers. Your boots echoed on cobblestones still damp from overnight rain. Captain Robles had offered to accompany you, but you'd refused. This was not a king's business. This was a man's.

The cathedral doors stood open even at this hour—Basel had become a city of perpetual theological activity, and some council father was always at prayer or debate. You entered the nave and found it nearly empty. A few monks knelt in distant corners. Candles flickered before the altar, casting dancing shadows across the stone pillars.

You chose a spot away from others, knelt on the cold floor, and crossed yourself.

Lord, show me Your plans.

The words felt inadequate. Your mind raced with strategies, arguments, diplomatic calculations. Fray Hernando's voice echoed: Before any major decision at Basel, spend one hour in silence asking: "What if I am wrong?"

You tried to quiet your thoughts. The stone pressed hard against your knees. The scent of incense mingled with the dampness of ancient walls.

What if I am wrong?

I think about this for some time. What if I am wrong?

If I am wrong, the thousands suffer or die. If I am wrong, I will suffer or die. But I care not for myself, I care for others. 
But what if I am wrong about doing nothing? What if I think I am wrong and am wrong about that as well? I need something firm. Something steadfast that I can fall back on. To guide me as a anchor a ship when making desicions. I search the cathedral for some sign, something to hold on to. Inspiration. guidance. Looking around, what do I see?

Envisioned emotionally charged scene, prioritized vivid description over character action



Your gaze wandered across the nave—the stone pillars rising into shadow, the distant altar with its flickering candles, the hunched forms of monks at their devotions. Nothing spoke to you. The cathedral remained what it was: cold stone shaped by human hands, indifferent to your turmoil.

Then movement caught your eye.

A figure knelt in a side chapel dedicated to the Virgin, partially obscured by a pillar. The man wore the red of a cardinal, his biretta set carefully on the pew beside him. His hands were clasped so tightly the knuckles had gone white, and his shoulders trembled with suppressed emotion.

Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini.

You recognized him from the Abbott's descriptions—the papal legate who presided over this Council, the moderate voice trying desperately to prevent schism. The man who had consulted privately with Fray Hernando three times. The bridge-builder caught between two irreconcilable positions.

He was weeping.

Not the dignified tears of formal mourning, but the ragged, silent sobs of a man pushed beyond endurance. His lips moved in prayer, but no sound emerged. Before him, a single candle burned beneath a statue of Mary holding the infant Christ. The cardinal's eyes were fixed on that image—mother and child, protection and innocence—as if pleading for guidance he could not find.

He had not seen you. The pillar and the early hour had given him what he clearly believed was privacy for his grief. In this moment, stripped of his office and his careful diplomacy, Cardinal Cesarini looked like nothing so much as a man drowning.

The candle flame guttered in some unfelt draft, sending shadows dancing across his anguished face.

GM: How far away am I from the cardinal? I want to understand my position relative to him.

14 nov 2025

Established spatial positioning without prescribing player action



You kneel in the main nave, roughly halfway between the great doors and the altar. The cardinal is in a side chapel to your left, perhaps thirty paces distant. A thick stone pillar stands between you and him—you can see him because you shifted your gaze while searching the cathedral, catching sight of him through the gap between pillar and chapel arch.

From his position, kneeling and facing the Virgin's statue, he would have to turn his head significantly to see you. The early morning dimness and the pillar's shadow work in your favor. You are not hidden, exactly—if he looked directly toward the nave, he might spot you—but his attention is wholly consumed by his prayer and his grief.

The few monks scattered throughout the cathedral are even farther away, absorbed in their own devotions. No one else seems to have noticed the cardinal's distress, or if they have, they are granting him the privacy of pretended ignorance.

You could rise and approach him. You could remain where you are and observe. You could leave quietly before he notices your presence. You could call out to him.

The choice is yours, and for now, you remain unseen.

I get up and walk closer to the cardinal. Then wait at a respectable distance to grant him a moment with his feelings in privacy. 
If it seems like he has composed himself, I approach and ask if I can pray with him. 

I came here to search my soul for guidance and find purity or inspiration. How can I walk the right path if sins are lurking everywhere. What would Jezus do if he was here?

Calibrated dignified ecclesiastical response with measured emotional restraint


You rose quietly from your kneeling position, your joints protesting the cold stone. Moving slowly so as not to startle him, you walked toward the side chapel, your boots making soft sounds on the flagstones. When you reached a point perhaps ten paces from the chapel entrance, you stopped.

And waited.

The cardinal continued his silent prayer, shoulders still trembling. Minutes passed—five, perhaps ten. The dawn light through the cathedral windows grew stronger, shifting from grey to pale gold. Gradually, the trembling subsided. Cesarini drew a deep, shuddering breath. His hands unclenched. He reached up and wiped his face with his sleeve—an oddly human gesture for so elevated a churchman.

He straightened his back, squared his shoulders. The transformation was remarkable. The broken man reassembled himself piece by piece into the papal legate, the presiding officer of the Council, the diplomat who held Christendom's fragile peace in his hands.

He reached for his biretta.

That was when he turned slightly and saw you.

Cesarini froze for just an instant—long enough for you to see the flash of alarm in his eyes, the realization that his moment of weakness had been witnessed. Then the mask settled fully into place. He rose from his knees with practiced grace, biretta in hand, and faced you.

His eyes were still reddened, his cheeks still damp. But his voice, when he spoke, carried the measured calm of a man accustomed to difficult audiences.

"Your Majesty of Castile. You are... abroad early."

The words were neutral, carefully chosen. Neither welcoming nor dismissive. He was waiting to see why you were here, what you wanted, what you had seen.

Excuse me father, I did not want to intrude upon a person such as yourself or disturb you while at prayer. I came alone to pray this morning because my soul is heavy with worry about what path to take next. Yesterday, I had a long talk with my confessor and he advised me to seek guidance in the church every morning to guard my soul against temptation and sin. I know full well that the image, power and prestige I wield are significant. But what if I am wrong? I try to act out of love and compassion, but even those intentions can be twisted into divine justification for my actions. 

I was praying father for something. A sign, something to guide me. A light or some cornerstone in faith I can fall back on and reason from there. Align my actions along with it. What is even true in this world? What is from God's kingdom?

When I say you praying there all alone...I hope you can forgive me for approaching you. I was hoping you could pray with me for a moment if you would indulge me father. It would help and honour me greatly.

CARDINAL CESARINI'S REACTION TO JUAN'S SPIRITUAL REQUEST

Success Factors (strengthened by Juan's speech):

Remarkable humility - admits uncertainty, fears being wrong
"What if I am wrong?" is precisely the question faithful people should ask
No political content whatsoever - purely spiritual request

Cesarini still mortified at being caught weeping
Even genuine humility can be diplomatic tool
Trained to be suspicious of convenient encounters
Every interaction with foreign king has political implications
Just composed himself - may not want to be vulnerable again
Speech could be calculated to appeal to his emotional state

Orchestrated dignified acceptance with guarded pastoral counsel




Cardinal Cesarini studied you for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Then something shifted in his bearing—a subtle relaxation, though his guard remained firmly in place. He inclined his head with practiced grace.

"You need not ask forgiveness, Your Majesty. A man who seeks guidance in prayer deserves no rebuke."

He gestured toward the chapel. "Come. We shall pray together."

He moved back to the kneeling rail before the Virgin's statue, making space for you beside him. As you knelt, he crossed himself and bowed his head. His hands folded with the ease of long habit.

"Let us pray."

His voice took on the measured cadence of liturgical Latin—familiar, formal, safe. He offered prayers for wisdom, for guidance, for protection against pride and error. The words were beautiful, theologically precise, and utterly impersonal. This was Cardinal Cesarini the priest performing his pastoral office, not the man you had seen weeping moments before.

When the prayers concluded, he remained kneeling but turned slightly toward you.

"Your Majesty asks what is true in this world. What is from God's kingdom." His tone was gentle but careful. "The Church teaches that Scripture, Tradition, and the Magisterium together guide us toward truth. When we are uncertain, we submit ourselves to these authorities. When we fear our intentions are corrupted, we examine our conscience before God and seek counsel from those wiser than ourselves."

He paused.

"You have completed a great work in Granada. God has blessed your arms. But you are right to question whether past blessing guarantees future righteousness. Many kings have fallen into error precisely because they believed their victories proved their virtue."

The cardinal rose smoothly, brushing dust from his red robes.

"Continue to pray. Continue to seek counsel. Guard yourself against the sin of certainty." He offered a small, professional smile. "If I may be of service to you during your time in Basel, Your Majesty, you need only send word."

The offer was genuine but formal—the courtesy of a senior churchman to a visiting monarch. Nothing more.

Where in this church may one find God father?

Weighed spiritual inquiry against pastoral restraint and formality






The cardinal paused, his hand resting on the chapel's stone archway. The question seemed to catch him off guard—not because it was difficult, but perhaps because it was so direct. So simple. So unlike the complicated theological debates that filled his days.

He turned back toward the altar, his gaze settling on the tabernacle behind it—the golden vessel where the consecrated Host was kept.

"There," he said quietly, pointing. "In the Blessed Sacrament. Christ's true presence. Body, blood, soul, and divinity. That is where God dwells most fully in any church."

He lowered his hand.

"But also..." He gestured more broadly. "In the faithful at prayer. 'Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them.' In the Word proclaimed from that pulpit. In the sacraments administered at that altar. In the architecture itself—stone raised toward heaven by human hands seeking to honor the divine."

Cesarini's voice remained measured, catechetical. A priest teaching basic doctrine.

Then he was quiet for a moment, and something flickered across his face—gone almost before you could name it.

"Some days, Your Majesty, I confess God feels very far from this place. These halls echo with arguments about His Church, but the arguments themselves..." He stopped himself, pressing his lips together as if he had said too much.

When he spoke again, his tone had returned to formal courtesy.

"Seek Him in the Eucharist. Seek Him in silence. Seek Him in the faces of the poor and suffering. These are where Christ promised to be found. The rest—" he gestured vaguely toward the cathedral nave where Council fathers would soon gather, "—the rest is men's work. Sometimes holy. Sometimes not."

He inclined his head.

"Was there something else, Your Majesty?"

Where two are gathered in my name, there I am in the midst of them. 

I take the Cardinal and sit him down with me in the benches. 

Be with us O lord, not when we gather in plain sight for all to see, but be with us in darkness. Be with us when no-one sees. We do not seek glory in the eyes of others just glory in your name. We do not seek worldly rewards, we seek doing the right thing, to be good for we know you reward those thing and your reward is eternal. 

I do not know what to do o Lord. Fighting Moors in Grenada seems so easy compared to crusades against fellow christians. How can I support such actions? And how can I condone your monestaries being seized by greedy nobles? What must I do when every choice seems like the wrong one? How can I even begin to discuss the righteousness of your church when all I want to do is place my every faith, trust and my very soul into the hands of your church o Lord. What are you asking of me? I want nothing but to serve you truthfully, honourably and without reservation. How can I consider politics? I should banish such thoughts from my mind, for your holyness should not be tarnished by such eartly matters. 

Juan gets emotional. 

You know my heart o Lord. You know how I long to protect Isabel and my little Catalina for they represent all that is good, just and fair in this world. I know that I might do terrible things to protect them. Everything. And I know that there may come a time when you make me choose between them and the path that leads to your kingdom. I do not know lord what I would do, for to me Isabel and our child and your kingdom are one and the same. 

We walk in shadow o lord, surrounded we are by worldly concerns. Where is your light? 

Juan takes a few deep breaths. 

I fear I have lost your path o lord. I cannot see your light as I did before. And I lead so many along with me now. I cannot see your light shine in the darkness! I am not worthy.

Weighed emotional vulnerability against Cardinal's defensive composure






CARDINAL CESARINI'S REACTION TO JUAN'S EMOTIONAL PRAYER

Success Factors (strengthened significantly):

Profound spiritual vulnerability - kings rarely show such doubt
Prayer addresses real theological crises Cesarini himself wrestles with
No political agenda visible - purely spiritual anguish
"Crusades against fellow Christians" - exactly Cesarini's impossible position
Admits he might be wrong, might be unworthy - rare humility
Love for family is pure and relatable
"I cannot see your light" - spiritual desolation Cesarini clearly shares
Echoes the Cardinal's own weeping moments ago
Invokes "where two or three are gathered" - Cardinal's own words
Asks for God's presence "when no one sees" - genuine piety
Physical intimacy of sitting together creates brotherhood
Failure Factors (persist regardless of roll):

Being physically sat down is presumptuous for a cardinal
Cesarini was trying to maintain professional distance
Intensity may feel overwhelming or manipulative
Cardinal just composed himself - this threatens his control
Still a foreign king with political implications
Cesarini may lack emotional capacity after his own crisis
Trained to be suspicious of convenient spiritual displays
Loss of control over the interaction

Orchestrated guarded pastoral response balancing counsel with emotional distance



Cardinal Cesarini had stiffened when you took his arm and guided him to the bench. His eyes widened slightly at the presumption—cardinals were not accustomed to being physically directed by anyone save the Pope himself. But he did not resist, and as your prayer poured forth, he remained seated beside you, his hands folded in his lap.

He listened in silence as your words tumbled out—the anguish about crusades against Christians, the fear of losing God's path, the impossible weight of protecting Isabel and Catalina while serving heaven. His expression remained carefully composed, though once or twice his jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.

When you finished, your breath ragged with emotion, the cardinal was quiet for a long moment. The morning light had grown stronger now, streaming through the high windows and casting long shadows across the nave.

Finally, he spoke. His voice was gentle but measured—the tone of a confessor who has heard a thousand souls in torment.

"Your Majesty, what you describe is the dark night of the soul. The mystics write of it—Saint John of the Cross, the holy Carmelites. When God seems absent, when His light is hidden, when every path seems wrong. This is not abandonment. This is purification."

He turned slightly toward you, though his eyes remained fixed on some middle distance.

"You ask what God wants of you. I cannot answer that. No man can. But I can tell you what the Church teaches: when we cannot see the path, we walk by faith. When we cannot hear God's voice, we obey His commandments. When every choice seems wrong, we choose the one that serves love over power, mercy over wrath, humility over pride."

His hands remained folded, still and controlled.

"You speak of protecting your wife and child. This is holy. You speak of fearing you might do terrible things for them. This is wisdom—for the man who does not fear his own capacity for sin is already lost to it."

The cardinal rose from the bench, smoothing his robes.

"Continue in prayer, Your Majesty. Examine your conscience daily. Seek the counsel of your confessor—Fray Hernando is a wise and holy man. Submit yourself to the Church's guidance, even when—" he paused almost imperceptibly, "—especially when that guidance is difficult to discern."

He made the sign of the cross over you.

"Dominus vobiscum. The Lord be with you. I will pray for your discernment. And for Queen Isabel's safe delivery."

He inclined his head with formal courtesy.

"Now, if Your Majesty will excuse me, I have duties that require my attention. The Council convenes at Terce."

I thank him and return to my quarters and invite the byzantines for council

14 nov 2025

Orchestrated Juan's departure and Byzantine delegation summons




You rose from the bench and bowed your head to the cardinal.

"Thank you, Your Eminence. God keep you."

Cesarini nodded once, then turned and walked toward the sacristy, his red robes whispering against the stone floor. Within moments, he had disappeared through a side door, leaving you alone in the chapel with the Virgin's statue and the single guttering candle.

You knelt once more before leaving—a brief, silent prayer for Isabel, for Catalina, for guidance. Then you made your way back through the nave and out into the morning light.

Basel had awakened during your time in the cathedral. The streets bustled with delegations moving toward their morning meetings, merchants opening their shops, servants carrying messages between lodgings. Your white tabard with its red cross drew glances—everyone in Basel knew the King of Castile had arrived.

Captain Robles waited outside the merchant's house, his expression shifting from concern to relief when he saw you approach.

"Your Majesty. I was about to send men to search for you."

"I was at prayer, Captain. Send Brother Guillem to the Byzantine delegation immediately. Invite Metropolitan Bessarion and Metropolitan Isidore to meet with me here at their earliest convenience. Tell them I wish to hear their situation and understand their needs. No retinue necessary—this is counsel between Christians, not formal audience."

Robles nodded sharply. "At once, Your Majesty."

Within the hour, you had broken your fast with simple bread and watered wine. You changed from your prayer clothes into more appropriate attire—still modest, but befitting a king receiving foreign dignitaries. The merchant's study where you had spoken with Abbott Rodrigo the previous evening was arranged with three chairs and a small table bearing wine, water, and dried fruit.

Shortly before the bells rang for Terce, Brother Guillem returned.

"Your Majesty, the metropolitans will attend you within the hour. They seemed..." he paused, choosing his words carefully, "...eager, though cautious. Metropolitan Bessarion asked if you would receive them alone or with your delegation present."

Lets start alone. When my delegation is needed, we can summon the later. 

I wait until they arrive

14 nov 2025

Orchestrated Byzantine delegation arrival and dialogue opening





The bells of Basel rang Terce—the third hour of prayer, mid-morning. You waited in the merchant's study, the window open to let in the spring air. Outside, you could hear the city's sounds: cart wheels on cobblestones, distant voices arguing in German, Latin, French. The Council city never truly fell silent.

Shortly after the bells ceased, footsteps sounded on the stairs. Brother Guillem's voice, and two others speaking in accented Latin. A knock at the door.

"Your Majesty, the Metropolitan of Nicaea and the Metropolitan of Kiev."

"Enter."

The door opened, and two men stepped into the chamber.

Metropolitan Bessarion entered first. He was younger than you expected—perhaps forty, with a neatly trimmed dark beard and penetrating eyes that seemed to catalogue everything in the room within seconds. He wore the black robes and distinctive cylindrical hat of the Orthodox clergy, a golden pectoral cross resting against his chest. His bearing was that of a scholar: composed, watchful, precise.

Behind him came Metropolitan Isidore, older by perhaps a decade, his beard longer and streaked with grey. Where Bessarion's gaze was analytical, Isidore's was political—he assessed you not as a puzzle to solve but as a potential ally or threat to weigh. His robes were similar to his companion's, though slightly more worn from travel.

Both men stopped at a respectful distance and inclined their heads—not the full bow a Latin bishop might offer a king, but a gesture of courtesy between equals in faith.

Bessarion spoke first, his Latin precise and formal.

"Your Majesty of Castile. We thank you for receiving us. We have traveled far from Constantinople to seek aid for our people, and we have waited many months in this city of endless debates." His eyes met yours directly. "You asked yesterday to hear our position. We are here. What would you know of us?"

Welcome and please take a seat. 

As you know I have just completed the reconquistaI have and I will place my sword at the disposal of Christian cause and am willing to do so again. I know that my Grenada conquest was relatively simple compared to fighting the Ottomans, but I genuinely feel I can offer you real aid should you be willing to accept it. 

Right now, that is all I have, a willingness to help you as best I can. But I must be real about my own limitations, nor would I want to impose myself on your faith and Empire. Before I move any further, I would like to learn about you. What is your position? How can I help? Do you even want help in the first place? What are your concerns? 

Maybe after we have taken the time to get to know each other, we can let this cooperation bear fruit. 

I smile at them invitingly.

Analyzed persuasion mechanics and calibrated success thresholds for Byzantine reactions






BYZANTINE METROPOLITANS' REACTION TO JUAN'S OPENING

Success Factors (persist regardless of roll):

Asks to understand their position FIRST - rare respect from Latin
Admits own limitations openly - unusual humility for a king
"Do you even want help?" - acknowledges their agency, not assuming
Explicitly says he won't impose on their faith - addresses core fear
Uses word "cooperation" not "aid" - partnership framing
Invites them to sit as equals, not supplicants
Warm demeanor, not cold diplomacy
Reputation precedes him - completed Reconquista, returned treasury honestly
Came alone as promised - no political theater
Failure Factors (persist regardless of roll):

Eight months of Western promises with no action
Fourth Crusade - last "help" sacked their city (1204)
Speech is respectful but vague - no concrete commitments
"Place my sword at disposal" - what does this actually mean?
Castile is far from Constantinople - what can one Iberian king deliver?
They're desperate and time is critical - patience wears thin
Every Latin offer has hidden conditions
Getting to know each other takes time they don't have
Still a Latin king with Latin Church allegiances

Orchestrated a deeply skeptical Byzantine response to vague Western promises






The two metropolitans exchanged a glance—brief but unmistakable. Something passed between them, some shared recognition. Bessarion's expression, which had been carefully neutral, hardened almost imperceptibly. Isidore's lips pressed into a thin line.

They took the offered seats, but their posture remained stiff. Formal. Distant.

Metropolitan Bessarion spoke first, his Latin still precise but now carrying an edge that had not been there before.

"Your Majesty is gracious. Your words are... respectful. We thank you for that courtesy." He paused. "But Your Majesty will forgive us if we have heard such words before. Many times. From many Latin lords."

Isidore leaned forward, his older face creased with something between weariness and barely contained anger.

"Eight months, Your Majesty. Eight months we have sat in this city while Western theologians debate whether the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone or from Father and Son together. Eight months while our emperor waits in Constantinople, watching the Ottoman noose tighten. Eight months of 'getting to know each other' and 'taking time' and 'understanding positions.'"

Bessarion's voice remained controlled, but cold.

"You ask what our position is? Our position is simple: Constantinople will fall. Not in a generation. Not in a decade. Soon. Perhaps five years. Perhaps three. The Sultan masses troops. He builds new fortresses on our shores. He strangles our trade. And we—" he gestured to himself and Isidore, "—we sit here begging Latin princes who speak of 'willingness to help' while offering nothing concrete."

The younger metropolitan's eyes fixed on yours.

"You say you completed the Reconquista. We congratulate you. You say you will place your sword at the Christian cause. Noble words. But Castile is far from the Bosphorus, Your Majesty. Very far. And words—even sincere words—do not stop Turkish cannons."

Isidore's voice was rougher, more direct.

"You ask if we even want help. What we want is for the West to remember that Constantinople has stood as Christendom's shield against Islam for a thousand years while your ancestors were still learning to read. What we want is for one—just one—Latin prince to offer troops, ships, gold, without first demanding we abandon our faith and submit to Rome."

He sat back.

"So, Your Majesty of Castile. You wish to help? Then tell us plainly: what will you give, and what will you demand in return? No more 'getting to know each other.' Our people die while we talk."

I get up and stand in front of them. 

100.000 florins does Castille have in it's treasury reserve. I commit it all to the cause of aiding you. I will petition the pope to release the crusade funds that were returned after a successful crusade against Grenada. Together with my treasury, it will be about half a million florins. 

I have 800 crusaders here in Basel and most of them in Rome at the moment. They have been released from their crusader's vow and cannot command them into another crusade or war immediately, but I can ask them if they want to join me into a new war against the Ottomans. 

In Castille, I command about 5.000 soldiers from three orders who can set sail immediately should this be required. 

I have entered into an alliance with Aragon who will soon secure Naples. This gives me naval bases and a large fleet. I must confer with them but I have every expectation they will commit. 

I have founded an academy of Christian military commanders to come up with new tactics to fight the Ottomans. They have already educated officers and can provide doctrine for the army facing the Ottomans in the field. 

I myself will lead from the front like I did in Grenada. I will not ask a man to do something I am not willing to do myself. I have faith that I can rally more kingdoms to come to your aid, especially when there is hope for victory. Hungary and Poland seemed eager to help. 

A brother in need...you do not ask what he offers you in return when he is about to drown. You just help. I have but one request. My wife is with child and I have made a promise to be by her side during childbirth. A promise I cannot break. 

You speak plainly, so I will do so as well. I must admit, there are still many unknowns in my plans. But this is what Castille, what I am comitting.

Weighed concrete commitments against Byzantine skepticism and desperation










BYZANTINE REACTION TO JUAN'S CONCRETE COMMITMENTS

Success Factors (dramatically strengthened):

CONCRETE NUMBERS - exactly what they demanded
500,000 florins is enormous sum - could fund serious military campaign
5,000 Military Order knights are professional, proven soldiers
NO demand for religious submission - addresses their core fear
Only condition is personal (wife's childbirth) - deeply human, not political
Admits unknowns honestly - not overselling
Standing to address them shows conviction and respect
Personal leadership offer demonstrates genuine commitment
References Hungary/Poland - shows strategic thinking beyond one kingdom
Directly responded to their challenge with substance, not more words
Failure Factors (persist regardless of roll):

These are still PROMISES - nothing delivered yet
Crusade funds require papal approval - not guaranteed
800 crusaders released from vows - voluntary recruitment only
Aragon/Naples alliance is "expectation" not certainty
Military academy untested in actual Ottoman warfare
Castile geographically distant - logistics nightmare
They've heard grand promises before that came to nothing
One king's commitment - what if he dies? What if nobles refuse?
"Many unknowns" admitted - how many exactly?
Timeline unclear - Constantinople needs help NOW, not in years
D100 TABLE: BYZANTINE RESPONSE TO CONCRETE OFFER

Roll	Result
1-10	Suspicious Disbelief - Too good, must be a trap, demand to know the real conditions
11-20	Bitter Testing - Challenge every number, probe for weaknesses in his commitments
21-30	Grudging Acknowledgment - Impressive but press hard on delivery guarantees
31-40	Cautious Interest - First real offer they've received, but remain deeply wary
41-50	Skeptical Respect - Appreciate the concrete terms, question logistics and timeline
51-60	Measured Hope - See substance here, but need reassurance about papal cooperation
61-70	Genuine Engagement - Impressed despite themselves, begin discussing practicalities
71-80	Surprised Trust - His honesty about unknowns paradoxically builds confidence
81-87	Real Partnership - See potential ally, share their strategic assessment openly
88-93	Profound Relief - First Western lord to offer substance without demanding submission
94-97	Emotional Breakthrough - Years of desperation met with real hope, deeply moved
98-100	Complete Alliance - See him as God-sent answer, commit fully to partnership

Calibrated diplomatic skepticism yielding to substantive engagement






The two metropolitans sat very still as you spoke. With each concrete number—one hundred thousand florins, five hundred thousand total, five thousand knights, eight hundred crusaders—their expressions shifted subtly. Bessarion's analytical eyes narrowed, calculating. Isidore's weathered face lost some of its bitter edge.

When you finished, silence hung in the room for a long moment.

Bessarion spoke first, his voice notably different from before. The cold formality had thawed into something cautious but genuine.

"You... speak numbers. Actual numbers. Not 'the West will aid you' or 'Christendom must unite.' Numbers."

He glanced at Isidore, then back to you.

"Your Majesty, do you understand what you have just done? In eight months of pleading in this city, we have received theological lectures, promises to pray for our situation, and endless debates about whether our church is in error. You are the first—the first—Latin lord to speak of florins and soldiers rather than filioque clauses."

Isidore leaned forward, his earlier anger replaced by intense scrutiny.

"Half a million florins would fund a serious campaign. Five thousand Military Order knights are worth twice that number in regular infantry against the Turks. But—" he raised a finger, "—the Pope must release those crusade funds. What makes you believe he will do so? Eugenius is embattled. His treasury is strained. Will he part with three hundred thousand florins on your request alone?"

Bessarion nodded, picking up the thread.

"And your Military Orders—Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara. We know of them. Fearsome warriors. But their purpose has been Iberian crusade against the Moors. Will they follow their king across the Mediterranean to fight Ottomans? You say you command them, but do their Masters share your vision?"

The younger metropolitan stood, moving to the window, his mind clearly working through logistics.

"The naval question is critical. Constantinople is accessible only by sea unless you march through Ottoman territory—which you cannot. Naples would provide staging ground, yes. But King Alfonso has his own wars to fight. His own treasury to manage. You say you have 'every expectation' of his commitment. Expectation is not certainty."

He turned back to face you.

"And timing. You mention your wife's childbirth—we respect that. Family is sacred. But when would this aid arrive? Next year? The year after? The Sultan does not wait, Your Majesty. Each season he grows stronger while we grow weaker."

Isidore's voice softened—not suspicious now, but probing.

"You say you ask nothing in return. No submission to Rome. No abandonment of our faith. We want to believe this. But the Pope who must release those funds—what will he demand? You are allied with him. You carry his blessing. Will he give three hundred thousand florins to save an Orthodox Constantinople that refuses Latin supremacy?"

Both metropolitans watched you intently. They were no longer dismissing you. They were testing you—but the test had changed from "is he sincere?" to "can he actually deliver what he promises?"

I hold up my hand. 

First, you must be willing to accept any aid offered. I want to know if my aid is even wanted. 
Many of the assets I command require activation or in the case of Naples, require some events to play out. But we can summon the Aragonese ambassador, who is here for just this purpose. 

I summon him. 

I continue. 

And what aid does the Empire require right now? Are you under attack? How can my crusaders and military orders best be deployed? Don't worry about their loyalty, I command them fully and they are as loyal as any commander can be. 

My advice carries some weight with the pope. While you can understand I cannot speak for him, I have good faith that the treasury will be put at our disposal. 

Lets wait a moment for the ambassador to arrive.

14 nov 2025

Orchestrated Byzantine response, ambassador summoning, and scene progression





Bessarion's expression flickered with something between frustration and dark amusement.

"Do we want aid? Your Majesty, we have crossed half of Christendom, left our churches and our people, sat in this city for eight months enduring theological condescension—all to beg for aid. Yes. We want aid. We are drowning. We have been drowning for decades. Constantinople wants to live."

Isidore nodded grimly.

"The question is not whether we want help. The question is whether we can accept help that comes with chains. But you say you attach no chains. So yes—if you offer what you say, we want it. Desperately."

You called for Brother Guillem and instructed him to fetch Don Bernat de Centelles immediately. The monk bowed and departed swiftly.

Bessarion resumed his seat, his scholarly mind already organizing information.

"You ask what we need immediately. We are not under direct siege—not yet. The Sultan consolidates his position, builds his strength. But the noose tightens. Our immediate needs are thus:"

He counted on his fingers.

"First: naval strength. The Ottomans control the seas around us. We need galleys to keep supply lines open and to threaten Turkish coastal positions. Second: professional soldiers. Not peasant levies—trained men who can fight Turkish janissaries. Your Military Order knights would be invaluable. Third: artillery. The Sultan has cannons. Large ones. We need the same, or we need men who know how to counter them. Fourth: gold to hire mercenaries and repair our walls. Our treasury is exhausted."

Isidore added quietly, "And fifth: hope. Our people need to know the West has not abandoned them. That someone remembers we are Christians too."

Footsteps on the stairs interrupted. A knock, and Brother Guillem's voice: "Your Majesty, Don Bernat de Centelles, Ambassador of His Majesty King Alfonso of Aragon."

Show him in!

I inform the ambassador about the situation and how the situation in Naples has developed after the papal decree explicitly supports Aragon's claim to the throne.

14 nov 2025

Orchestrated ambassador's entrance and calibrated diplomatic response to papal decree






The door opened and Don Bernat de Centelles entered—a man in his mid-fifties with the weathered look of someone who had spent decades navigating Mediterranean politics. His clothing was fine but practical, his bearing that of a diplomat accustomed to difficult negotiations. He bowed to you first, then noticed the two Orthodox metropolitans in their distinctive black robes and cylindrical hats. His eyebrows rose slightly, but his expression remained composed.

"Your Majesty of Castile. You summoned me?"

You gestured for him to sit and began explaining the situation—the Byzantine delegation's desperate need for military aid, the concrete commitments you had just outlined, and crucially, the papal decree that now explicitly supported King Alfonso's claim to Naples against René of Anjou. You described how Pope Eugenius IV had declared his support publicly and promised to write to all Christian monarchs urging recognition.

Don Bernat listened intently, his diplomat's mind clearly working through implications. When you mentioned the papal decree, his eyes sharpened with genuine interest.

"His Holiness has declared for King Alfonso formally? In writing? With the Fisherman's Ring seal?" He leaned forward. "This changes much, Your Majesty. René of Anjou's claim rested heavily on papal favor. If Eugenius now supports my king openly..."

He glanced at the metropolitans, then back to you.

"But I must be plain, Your Majesty. King Alfonso's primary concern is Naples. His treasury, his fleet, his armies—these are committed to securing that throne. You speak of Constantinople, of Ottoman wars, of crusading eastward." He spread his hands carefully. "I am not authorized to commit Aragonese forces to campaigns beyond Naples. Such decisions rest with my king alone."

His tone was respectful but cautious—a man unwilling to overpromise on his master's behalf.

"What exactly do you propose regarding Aragon's role?"

Our problem is that Castille has very few ships on it's own and has no bases nearby to operate from. Support from Aragon and it's new bases in Naples changes this situation doesn't it? My cousin Alfons has promised me aid should I secure papal backing for him in Naples. I understand you do not speak for the king, but this makes our position against the Ottomans better doesn't it?

14 nov 2025

Weighed strategic logistics against diplomatic caution carefully




Don Bernat considered the question, his fingers steepling as he weighed his words.

"Strategically? Yes, Your Majesty. Unquestionably." He nodded slowly. "Naples changes everything for any Eastern operation. Without it, Castile must operate from... what? Valencia? The Balearics? Far too distant. Supply lines would stretch impossibly thin. But Naples—" he gestured eastward, "—Naples sits in the heart of the Mediterranean. Sicily even more so. From there, you can reach Greek waters in days rather than weeks."

He shifted in his chair, warming to the strategic discussion.

"King Alfonso commands one of the finest fleets in Christendom. Aragonese galleys are experienced in Mediterranean warfare. If Naples is secured—and with papal backing, that becomes far more likely—then yes, you would have access to ports, shipyards, and established naval infrastructure. The difference between operating from Iberia versus operating from Naples is the difference between feasible and impossible."

The ambassador glanced at the metropolitans, then back to you.

"And you say King Alfonso promised aid in exchange for papal support? If you have delivered that support through this decree..." He paused thoughtfully. "My king is a man of his word. He does not forget debts."

But his cautious diplomat's nature reasserted itself.

"However, Your Majesty, I must remind you—Naples is not yet secured. René of Anjou still presses his claim. Papal backing strengthens our position enormously, but there may yet be fighting. King Alfonso's immediate priority will be consolidating that throne. How quickly he could then turn attention eastward..." He spread his hands. "That I cannot say."

Metropolitan Bessarion had been listening intently. Now he spoke, his voice carefully neutral.

"So the aid Castile offers depends upon Aragon securing Naples, and Aragon turning its attention from Italian wars to Ottoman ones. How long might this take, Ambassador? A year? Two years? Five?"

Your ability for Castille to lend aid does not solely depend on securing Naples honoured Bessarion. It does help a great deal, but it does not prevent it. We have some bases in Naples and Aragon controls the whole of Sicily, so we are not entirely without means. 

I will arrange with Aragon to secure Naples as soon as possible. But in the mean time, we must not delay our aid. 

What are Constantinople's defences? How can we reinforce best?

14 nov 2025

Deliberated character authenticity and military intelligence sharing






Metropolitan Bessarion straightened in his chair, and for the first time, you saw the scholar give way to something else—a man who knew his city's strengths and weaknesses with painful intimacy.

"Constantinople's defenses are legendary, Your Majesty. The Theodosian Walls—triple walls stretching four miles across the peninsula. The outer wall, the inner wall rising behind it, and the great inner wall with towers every fifty yards. For a thousand years, these walls have broken every army that came against them. Persians, Arabs, Bulgars, Rus—all have failed."

His voice tightened.

"But legends do not repair crumbling mortar. The walls were built for a city of half a million. Constantinople now holds perhaps fifty thousand souls. We lack the men to garrison them properly. Sections have fallen into disrepair. We patch what we can, but—" he spread his hands helplessly.

Isidore took up the account, his gruffer voice adding strategic weight.

"The sea walls are similarly stretched. We control the Golden Horn with the great chain—a massive iron chain that can be raised to block enemy ships from entering the harbor. This is crucial. The Horn is our lifeline for supplies. But the chain requires ships behind it to be effective. We have few galleys remaining."

Bessarion nodded grimly.

"Our garrison numbers perhaps five thousand Greeks under arms. Emperor John could call perhaps another three thousand in emergency. Against the Sultan's forces..." He shook his head. "Murad commands tens of thousands. His janissaries are disciplined, professional. His artillery grows more formidable each year."

He fixed you with an intense stare.

"What we need most immediately: soldiers to man those walls. Professional soldiers—your Military Order knights would be invaluable. Even a thousand Western heavy cavalry could transform our defensive capability. Second: gold to hire mercenaries and repair the weakest wall sections before the Sultan decides the time is right. Third: naval presence to keep the sea lanes open. If the Ottomans blockade us completely, we starve."

Isidore leaned forward.

"The Sultan has not yet committed to full siege. He tests us. Probes our weaknesses. But when he comes—and he will come—he will bring everything. Cannons that can breach even Theodosian walls. Tens of thousands of troops. A navy to challenge our waters. We must be ready before that day, not after."

Both men watched you, waiting to see if these harsh realities would dampen your enthusiasm or steel your resolve.

So the first priority should be to send professional western soldiers along with the means to enact repair of the walls. This first reinforcement will improve the position greatly. I can set this in motion without requiring anyone's permission. I can command it myself. 1000 men and funds to repair the walls. Done. 

I then must confer with Aragon and conclude the Naples campain. This secures our bases and frees up their combined fleets. 

I must then seek to build up a land army large enouth to threaten the Ottomans in the field. But that is for later concern. First we must make sure the Sultan cannot just take the city when he feels like it.

Weighed concrete commitment against logistical complexities and execution challenges







The two metropolitans exchanged another glance—but this one was different from before. Where earlier their shared looks had carried bitterness and skepticism, this one held something almost like wonder. Cautious wonder, but wonder nonetheless.

Metropolitan Isidore spoke first, his gruff voice softened by something approaching emotion.

"'Done.' You say it as if you were ordering supplies for a feast, not committing a thousand soldiers to cross the Mediterranean." He shook his head slowly. "Do you understand, Your Majesty, what that word means to us? Eight months of 'we shall consider' and 'the matter requires further discussion' and 'let us pray on this together.' And you say 'done.'"

Bessarion leaned forward, his scholar's mind immediately moving to practicalities.

"Your Majesty's decisiveness is... remarkable. But forgive us—we must ask the questions that determine whether 'done' becomes reality or remains another Western promise."

He held up a finger.

"First: these thousand soldiers. You mentioned five thousand Military Order knights in Castile. Will you draw from them? They are oath-bound to their Orders' Masters, are they not? You said you command them, but—have you consulted with the Masters of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara about sending their knights to Constantinople rather than fighting Moors?"

A second finger.

"Second: transport. A thousand armored knights with horses, weapons, supplies. This requires ships. Many ships. You have few of your own, you said. Will you hire Genoese? Venetian? Both cities have their own interests in Constantinople—Venice especially. The Venetians will want to know why Castilian soldiers sail through waters they consider their domain."

A third finger.

"Third: timing. When? You must return to Toledo for your wife's childbirth—we respect this. But when do these soldiers depart Castile? When do they arrive at Constantinople? The sailing season in the Mediterranean is not unlimited. Autumn storms make passage dangerous. If they do not depart soon..."

Isidore cut in, his tone not hostile but urgent.

"And the funds for wall repairs—how much? Constantinople's walls stretch miles. Even basic repairs to the weakest sections could cost tens of thousands of florins. We are grateful for any amount, but we must know what we can actually plan for."

Both men watched you intently. They were not rejecting your offer—far from it. They were trying to understand if this king who spoke so decisively had thought through the execution, or if his enthusiasm outpaced his planning.

Don Bernat de Centelles sat quietly, observing the exchange with diplomatic interest.

how much do you need to repair the walls?

14 nov 2025

Researched historical fortification costs for accuracy



Bessarion and Isidore exchanged a look. The younger metropolitan rose and moved to the window, his fingers drumming against his thigh as he calculated.

"The full restoration of the Theodosian Walls to their ancient glory? Impossible. We speak of millions of florins and decades of work. But that is not what we need." He turned back to face you. "We need the weakest sections repaired sufficiently to withstand cannon bombardment. The places where mortar has crumbled, where towers lean, where the outer wall has collapsed entirely."

Isidore pulled a small leather satchel from within his robes—clearly something he carried always, prepared for exactly this conversation. He withdrew a folded parchment covered in Greek script and rough sketches.

"We have surveyed. We know where the walls are most vulnerable." He spread the parchment on the table. "The Blachernae section in the north—where the walls meet the Golden Horn. This area was built later, weaker than the main Theodosian construction. The Sultan will target it. To properly reinforce this section alone: fifteen thousand florins minimum."

Bessarion added, "The stretch near the Gate of St. Romanus—the middle section where the Lycus River passes through. The ground is lower there, the walls more accessible to siege engines. Another twenty thousand florins to shore up properly."

Isidore traced his finger along the sketch.

"Various other sections—towers needing new roofs, gates requiring reinforcement, moat that must be cleared of debris. Perhaps another fifteen to twenty thousand florins for critical repairs across the entire length."

He looked up.

"Fifty to sixty thousand florins, Your Majesty. That would not make the walls impregnable—nothing can do that against modern cannon. But it would make the Sultan bleed for every yard. It would buy time. Time for reinforcements to arrive. Time for the West to remember that Constantinople's fall means Ottoman armies at the gates of Vienna within a generation."

Bessarion's voice was quiet but intense.

"Can Castile provide such a sum? Specifically for walls, separate from funds for soldiers?"

I can write to Castille right now and command a force of 1000 soldiers to be shipped to the city, carrying a treasury of 60.000 florins for wall repairs. 

I show them the papal decree declaring me the sole commander and owner of the military orders in perpetuity. 

They would do as I command even without this papal decree. The Grenada crusade has forged us together. 

The crusaders resting in Rome have always been under my personal command. I expect many will join me if I ask, but I know I cannot command the hearts of men. Only the lord can. 

Regarding everything else, there is much work for me to do. And I must say, I am glad for it. This council asks impossible questions of any faithful Christian. Helping our brothers in faith is very concrete and something I can actually do.

Weighed Juan's concrete offers against Byzantine skepticism and papal entanglement concerns








BYZANTINE RESPONSE TO CONCRETE COMMITMENT AND PAPAL DECREE

Success Factors (dramatically strengthened):

Shows PROOF of authority - papal decree with Fisherman's Ring seal
60,000 florins matches EXACTLY what they said they needed - he listened carefully
1,000 professional Military Order knights - precisely what they requested
"Write the order right now" - immediate action, not future promises
Military Orders' loyalty proven through Granada campaign - track record
Authentic enthusiasm about concrete help vs. theological debates - genuine motivation
Still no conditions attached - remarkable for Latin lord
Addresses their core complaint (words without action) with substance and proof
Failure Factors (persist regardless of roll):

Papal decree makes him MORE entangled with Rome, not less
"Perpetual command" comes from Pope who may demand Orthodox submission for aid
Shipping 1,000 armored knights across Mediterranean still requires ships they haven't discussed
60,000 florins is from Castilian treasury - what of the 300,000+ crusade funds he mentioned?
"Expect many will join" regarding crusaders - still speculation, not certainty
His alliance with Pope raises question: what will Eugenius demand in return?
One king's enthusiasm doesn't bind his successors or his nobles
Timeline still unclear - when does the order get written, when do ships sail?

98-100	Tears of Relief - Years of desperation met with real action, watershed moment
Shall I roll?

GM: looking at the failure factors, I require some clarification. 

The Greeks asked me what I can do for them "right now". This answer is given in dialogue style to answer this question. Is it not a bit unfair I do not mention the 300.000 crusade funds? I cannot command this myself butI will put myself to work like I mention to do this and all the other things as well(securing alliances, Naples, Aragon aid, ect). And is it really a failure factor that I do not mention that I can hire ships to transport them? I thought this spoke for itself. 

You mention timeline is unclear while I explicitly state I can write the order IMMEDIATELY. 

The perpetual command comes from the pope but gives him no agency after this was granted. He explicitly can not retract this, not even other popes. How can the pope demand concessions based on this? I think he cannot.

I speak for myself. I do have an alliance with the pope. Is this not a bit harsh? 

Reflect on this.

Reassessed fairness of critique and acknowledged player's valid counterarguments




You make excellent points. Let me reconsider:

You're right about:

The 300,000 florins - You already explained these require papal approval. Repeating this when asked "what can you do RIGHT NOW" would be redundant. You answered exactly what was asked - what you can command immediately versus what requires negotiation.
Hiring ships - This is implicit and obvious. Of course troops require transport. The legitimate concern is practical logistics (timing, cost, sailing seasons), not whether you mentioned it explicitly.
Timeline - You said "write the order right now." That IS immediate. The question is how long shipping takes, not when you act.
Perpetual command - You're absolutely correct. The decree explicitly binds all future popes. Eugenius CANNOT demand concessions based on something irrevocably granted. He has no leverage here.
Your alliance - Fair point. The Greeks' concern is general Latin-papal entanglement, not that you personally are untrustworthy.
Revised Failure Factors:

General Greek distrust of anything connected to Rome (historical, not personal)
Practical logistics still need working out (ship hire, sailing season, timing of arrival)
One king's commitment - what if political situation in Castile changes?
Crusade treasury (the 300k) still requires papal approval - will Eugenius cooperate?
Long distance means problems could arise during execution
These are realistic concerns, not criticisms of your response. The roll determines how much the Greeks trust your ability to overcome these practical obstacles.

Shall I roll with this understanding?

Orchestrated breakthrough moment establishing genuine partnership and trust





The room fell silent for a long moment. Bessarion stared at the papal decree in your hands, his scholar's eyes tracing the seal, the signatures, the weight of what it represented. Isidore sat very still, his weathered hands gripping the arms of his chair.

Then Bessarion did something unexpected. He rose from his seat, crossed the small distance between you, and took the decree gently from your hands. He examined it closely—the vellum, the Latin script, the unmistakable impression of the Fisherman's Ring in red wax. Twenty-three cardinal signatures. When he looked up, his expression had transformed.

"This is real," he said quietly. "Perpetual and irrevocable. No pope can revoke it. These Military Orders—five thousand knights—they are yours. Truly yours."

He handed the decree back with something approaching reverence.

Isidore rose as well, his gruff demeanor cracking. When he spoke, his voice was thick.

"Your Majesty. Forgive us our bitterness. Eight months we have sat in this city, and every Latin lord who spoke to us wanted something. 'Accept papal supremacy, then we will help.' 'Abandon your liturgy, then we will send ships.' 'Admit your theology is error, then we will consider aid.' Always conditions. Always demands that we cease to be Orthodox before we are worthy of Christian brotherhood."

He shook his head slowly.

"You show us proof of your authority. You commit exactly what we said we needed—not more, not less. You say you will write the order now. And you ask nothing of our faith. Nothing."

Bessarion moved to the window, his voice thoughtful but warm.

"The logistics remain. Ships must be hired. Sailing seasons respected. A thousand knights must be provisioned for a long journey. But these are problems of execution, not problems of will. For the first time in eight months, we speak with a Western lord about how to help, not whether to help."

He turned back.

"Your Majesty, we must send word to Emperor John immediately. He must know that Castile offers real aid. This changes our entire negotiating position—not just here at Basel, but with Venice, with Genoa, with all who have watched Constantinople's slow death with indifference."

Isidore stepped closer, his eyes meeting yours directly.

"We have been... difficult. Suspicious. You understand why, yes? The Fourth Crusade is not ancient history to us. It is living memory. Our grandparents saw Latin soldiers sack our churches, melt our icons for gold, place a Latin patriarch in the Hagia Sophia. When Latins speak of 'helping' Constantinople, our blood runs cold."

His voice softened.

"But you are different. We see this now. You speak of soldiers and florins, not theology and submission. You admit what you cannot yet deliver rather than promising everything and delivering nothing. You show us proof rather than asking for faith."

He glanced at Bessarion, who nodded.

"We would discuss practical matters with you, Your Majesty. Shipping routes. Timing. How to coordinate your Military Orders with our garrison. How to ensure these sixty thousand florins reach Constantinople safely and are spent on walls rather than disappearing into corruption. We have much experience with... disappointment. We would plan carefully, with contingencies for what might go wrong."

Bessarion added, "And we would discuss the larger question—the crusade treasury you mentioned, the alliance with Aragon, the possibility of a true Western army that could threaten the Sultan in the field. Not as demands, but as hopes. As possibilities we might build toward together."

Both men stood before you now, their posture open, their suspicion replaced by something fragile but genuine.

"Will you work with us on these details, Your Majesty? As partners?"

Before we do, there is something important that we must adress. 

When someone is drowning, you do not ask for reward before saving him. In your case, I seek not a reward per se, but we must discuss the new situation we create. Will my help create a permanent dependancy on Castille? And even with every good will in the world, is Castille able to maintain this aid across generations? I can empty the treasury because it is mine to give, but even I cannot command my people to fight and die for a far and foreign land indefinately? 

How strong is the Byzantine Empire and is just one strong push enouth for help? 

Do not get me wrong, I do want to help. But I do have to ask the hard questions as well. Can Constantinople even be saved? And what do we have to do to make it so? 

To be concrete, must I create a new order and permanently station them in Constantinople? How big must they be and is the emperor prepared to allow this? Can Latin christians settle in the city?

Weighed strategic complexities of sustained foreign aid and Byzantine viability





The two metropolitans' expressions shifted. Bessarion's scholarly composure returned, and Isidore's weathered face grew thoughtful. They exchanged a glance—this time one of respect for the question itself.

Bessarion lowered himself back into his chair, his fingers steepled.

"You ask the question that no Latin lord has asked us, Your Majesty. They promise aid without considering whether that aid solves the problem or merely delays it. You think as a strategist, not a sentimentalist. This is... good. Painful, but good."

He was quiet for a moment, clearly choosing his words with care.

"Can Constantinople be saved? If you mean 'can the city survive one Ottoman assault'—yes. With your thousand knights and sixty thousand florins, with walls repaired and professional soldiers on the ramparts, we could break a siege. The Sultan would bleed. He might withdraw, regroup, wait for better opportunity."

His voice grew heavier.

"But if you mean 'can the Byzantine Empire return to its former strength'—no. That empire is gone. We control Constantinople, a few Aegean islands, scraps of the Peloponnese. We are not an empire. We are a city-state pretending to imperial dignity."

Isidore leaned forward, his bluntness cutting through.

"Your Majesty asks the hard question, so we give the hard answer. Constantinople cannot survive indefinitely as it is. Our population shrinks. Our treasury empties. Our young men flee west seeking opportunity. Each generation, we grow weaker while the Ottomans grow stronger. One strong push? No. One strong push saves us for five years. Perhaps ten. Then the Sultan returns with more cannons, more troops, more determination."

Bessarion nodded grimly.

"For Constantinople to truly survive, it needs what you describe—permanent Western presence. Not charity, but partnership. Not emergency aid, but institutional commitment. Your question about a permanent military order..." He paused. "This touches on matters of sovereignty and faith that are delicate."

He stood and moved to the window again, his back to you as he spoke.

"The Emperor would accept Latin soldiers to man the walls—he has no choice. But a permanent military order? Knights who hold lands in Constantinople, who answer to their Order's Master rather than the Emperor, who maintain Latin rites in an Orthodox city? This is... complicated."

He turned back.

"We remember the Latin Empire. When the Fourth Crusade conquered us, they established a Latin Patriarch. Latin knights held Greek lands. Our people became second-class subjects in their own city. That occupation lasted fifty-seven years before we reclaimed Constantinople. The scars run deep."

Isidore's voice was quiet but intense.

"You ask if Latin Christians can settle in the city. Some already do—Venetian and Genoese merchants have their quarters, their churches. We tolerate this. But a permanent military settlement? Thousands of Latin knights with their families, their priests, their Latin Masses? Our people would see this as slow conquest, not salvation."

He spread his hands.

"And yet—what choice do we have? Pride is a luxury the drowning cannot afford."

Bessarion returned to his seat, his expression troubled but thoughtful.

"Your Majesty, you ask what must be done to save Constantinople permanently. I will tell you the truth that we barely speak even among ourselves: Constantinople survives only if the Ottoman threat is broken. Not contained. Not held at bay. Broken. The Sultan's power must be shattered so thoroughly that he cannot threaten us for generations. This means not defending walls, but offensive war. Driving the Turks from Europe entirely."

He met your eyes.

"Can Castile commit to such a war? Can any Western power? You speak of tens of thousands of troops, years of campaigning, fortunes spent. Emperor Sigismund tried and failed. Five crusades against the Hussites failed. The Ottomans are more formidable than either."

Isidore added softly, "As for permanent dependency on Castile—Your Majesty, we are already dependent. On Venetian trade. On Genoese shipping. On whoever will sell us grain and weapons. Dependency on Castile would at least be dependency on someone who asks nothing of our faith."

Both men waited, their faces showing the weight of speaking such truths aloud.

I think for a long moment. 

My promise to repair the walls and my 1000 soldiers are given as gift and I ask nothing in return. It buys us time for you, for the Byzantine Empire, to make a choice. A choice about their future. 

The first choice is keep doing what we are doing right now. I support you and we delay the inevitable. We fight and die honourably in the defence of Christendom in the east. There is honour and simplicity in this, but the Empire would simply end. If we want to prevent this, far far more is needed. 

The second choice is migration. I offer every citizen of the empire refuge in my lands. An enormous operation, but together we can build and expand existing cities where your culture can bloom and blossom. not an empire of your own but living as respected brothers in my kingdom where we can honour God side by side. 

The third choice is the most ambitious and the most uncertain. We fight. We fight and we drive them from the continent completely. I am prepared to, but this will be extremely difficult. And if the empire does indeed wish this, it will be extremely dependant on Castillian aid and military security. It will require extraordinary effort on my part and on that of my kingdom. If we should decide to fight beyond the aid already given, I am only willing to give it if there is an actual chance of victory. I will regard this ask and cry for help for what it is: "Help us please, for we cannot save ourselves." I would have to think about what this would even look like, but I would require complete control and authority over the entire campain. And the Byzantines themselves would be prepared as well to fight for their very survival as well. 

I hope you can see that from my perspective, these are the only best choices before us. And please understand that I do not want to extract things from you when your backs are against the wall. 

This is what I propose we do: I will instruct an expedition to be formed of 1000 of my best and most zealous order members. They will be led by officers trained in my academy, instructed how to counter Ottoman tactics. They carry 60.000 florins with Castillian experts and workers to help wall construction and repair. My officials will oversee that the funds are allocated to actual repairs. I can write this order tonight. Assembling this force will take some time, but I can set it in motion. 

Then, I will sail and visit your city myself to meet with your emperor himself and discuss the options before us. I hope you have had time to think and to make an informed choice. I can discuss what structure we would use should we go to war and other details about our cooperation when I meet with the emperor himself. There are many questions, i know. Will the help and cooperation reduce our independance? What about our culture? These matters will be discussed later when there is time and you have had time to think what you want. Only with the emperor can I difinitively settle these matters. My aid gives us this time. 

What do you think?

Calibrated constructive diplomatic engagement framework




The silence stretched long after you finished speaking. Bessarion had gone very still, his scholar's mind clearly working through the implications of each word. Isidore's weathered face showed something like pain—but also relief, the relief of a man finally hearing truth spoken plainly.

It was Isidore who spoke first, his gruff voice thick with emotion.

"Your Majesty. In eight months, no one—no one—has spoken to us like this. They speak of 'saving Constantinople' as if it were simple. They promise aid as if a few thousand florins will restore an empire. They debate our theology as if correcting our Creed will make the Ottomans disappear."

He rose from his chair, moving to stand beside his colleague.

"You speak truth. Harsh truth. 'You cannot save yourselves.' These words cut deep. But they are honest, and we have had enough of comfortable lies."

Bessarion nodded slowly, his expression thoughtful rather than defensive.

"You offer us what no one else has—agency. Not 'accept our terms or perish,' but 'here is time to choose your fate.' The immediate aid without conditions gives us that time. This alone sets you apart from every Latin lord we have met."

He stood as well, his voice taking on the measured tone of a man analyzing a complex problem.

"Let us engage with your framework honestly, as you have engaged with us. The first option—delay the inevitable, die honorably—this is what we have been doing. It is not a choice. It is surrender dressed in dignity. We reject it, though we may be forced to it regardless."

Isidore continued, "The second option—migration. Your Majesty, you offer something remarkable. Refuge for our people in your lands. But you must understand what you propose. Constantinople is not merely a city. It is the New Rome. The seat of Orthodox Christianity. The continuation of the Roman Empire itself. To abandon it..." He shook his head. "This is not moving to a new home. This is ending a thousand years of civilization. Our people, scattered in foreign lands, would cease to be Byzantines within a generation. The culture might survive in fragments. The empire would be gone."

Bessarion's voice was quiet but intense.

"And yet—if the choice is extinction or transformation, perhaps transformation is not surrender. Perhaps preserving our people, our faith, our learning in Castilian lands is better than skeletons in Constantinople's ruins. This requires much thought."

He fixed you with his penetrating gaze.

"The third option. War. Driving the Ottomans from Europe entirely. Your Majesty, you say you would require complete control and authority over the campaign. This is... enormous. You ask the Emperor to place Byzantine survival in your hands. To trust a foreign king with everything."

Isidore cut in, his tone constructive rather than hostile.

"But consider our position. What authority do we actually have? Our army is five thousand men. Our treasury is empty. Our allies are absent. You offer real forces, real gold, real strategy. If we cannot save ourselves—and we cannot—then someone must save us. Better a king who asks nothing of our faith than lords who demand we cease to be Orthodox."

Bessarion raised a finger.

"Concerns remain. 'Complete control'—does this mean you command our soldiers as well as your own? Does this mean you dictate our alliances, our diplomacy, our domestic policy? The Emperor will need clarity on these boundaries."

He began pacing slowly.

"And the war itself. You speak of driving Ottomans from Europe. Your Majesty, do you comprehend the scale? The Sultan commands perhaps eighty thousand troops. His janissaries are the finest infantry in the world. His artillery—" he shook his head. "What forces can you actually bring to bear? You mentioned Hungary, Poland. Emperor Sigismund has tried to unite these powers and failed. What makes you believe you will succeed where he has not?"

Isidore added, "And if you commit fully to this war and fail—what then? Castile is bankrupted, your Military Orders destroyed in Turkish lands, and Constantinople falls anyway. You risk everything."

But despite these hard questions, both men's tone remained engaged rather than dismissive.

Bessarion returned to his seat.

"Your proposal to visit Constantinople yourself—this is crucial. Only face to face with Emperor John can such matters be settled. He must see you, measure you, understand what manner of man offers his sword. We can carry your message, but we cannot make such decisions for him."

Isidore nodded vigorously.

"We will send word immediately. Emperor John must know that a Western king offers concrete aid without demanding theological submission. That you propose to come yourself, to discuss these options in person. This will mean much to him."

He paused, his expression growing serious.

"Your Majesty, one question we must ask: your wife is with child. You must return to Toledo. When would you come to Constantinople? The journey is long. The sailing season has limits. Will you come this year? Next year? Time matters greatly to us."

Bessarion concluded quietly, "We are grateful for your honesty. We engage with your framework seriously because you have treated us seriously. We have concerns—sovereignty, authority, the scale of commitment required. But these are concerns of partners discussing difficult realities, not supplicants being dictated to. This is... new for us. And welcome."

Both men watched you, waiting for your responses to their questions.

Thank you for taking me serious as well. I speak with sincerity and am grateful for you to do so as well. 

You mention your remaining concerns. And I understand that you cannot possibly make these choices for the empire yourself. Your questions are valid and will discuss them at length with your emperor before we make any choice. But I feel like I should be honest as well and not sugar coat the facts as well. If you do want me to help and also want to maintain sovereign control over your own soldiers? When your very existence is at stake? This is exactly why Christian armies lose and I hope you see how absurd this would look. Again, the choice is yours, but I will not participate in a war that has no chance of victory. 

And yes, I fully understand the terrifying scale of such an operation. But it is like you said; it is the only way to save the city and the empire. But that also means there is much to fight for. I have faced Islam in battle and I am not afraid to die, but I will need to find even more allies and rally many more support than I command myself. I will need to figure this out. But it all starts with the choice or your empire. A choice that also means consequences and the commitment you actually are prepared to make in order for us to win. 

You ask as well what if we lose. Then I will probably be dead and my kingdom defeated. My wife and child will lose a father. Many more will suffer. But risking our lives is something we must be prepared to do if we want to win. If we are not prepared to die for victory, we have already lost. 

My soldiers will come as soon as possible. After my wife has given birth, I will come as soon as possible. I have my own fleet so I should be able to sail fast. I hope you understand I can not give you an exact timeline right now, all I give you is my word.

Gauged deepening diplomatic engagement and mapped emotional stakes





Bessarion was quiet for a long moment after you finished. Then, slowly, he nodded.

"You speak of unified command, and we resist instinctively. Pride. A thousand years of empire makes one proud." His voice carried a note of bitter self-awareness. "But you are right, Your Majesty. We come to you because we cannot save ourselves, then bristle when you say what salvation requires. This is... absurd. We see it. Whether the Emperor will see it..." He spread his hands. "That remains to be discovered."

Isidore's weathered face had grown somber.

"You say you are prepared to die. That your wife and child might lose you. That your kingdom might be bankrupted and defeated." He leaned forward, his eyes searching yours. "Your Majesty, we have begged many lords for help these eight months. They speak of crusade as glory. They speak of driving back the Turk as if it were a tournament. You speak of death. Of loss. Of what failure actually costs."

He stood abruptly, emotion breaking through his gruff exterior.

"This is why we trust you. Not because you promise victory—you do not. Not because you have certain plans—you admit you do not. We trust you because you understand what you offer to risk. A man who sees clearly the cost of failure and still commits—this is a man worth following into battle."

Bessarion rose as well.

"Your word. You give us your word that you will come after your wife's delivery, as soon as possible. Your Majesty, in eight months we have received many promises. Yours is the first we believe." He paused. "Not because we are naive, but because you have been honest about every uncertainty, every limitation, every risk. A man who speaks so plainly about what he cannot guarantee—his guarantees carry weight."

He moved toward the table where the papal decree still lay.

"We will write to Emperor John tonight. We will tell him everything. The immediate aid—one thousand knights, sixty thousand florins, no conditions. The three choices you have laid before us. Your willingness to come in person. Your requirement for unified command if we choose to fight. All of it, plainly stated."

Isidore added firmly, "We will advocate for you, Your Majesty. Not as supplicants grateful for scraps, but as metropolitans who have found a Western lord who treats us as partners rather than theological problems to be corrected. This means much."

Bessarion's expression grew thoughtful.

"The timing is uncertain—we understand. Your wife's delivery, the journey's length, the sailing season. But Emperor John will understand a man who honors his oath to his wife. We are Orthodox, Your Majesty. We understand that a man's word to his family is sacred."

He fixed you with his penetrating gaze.

"One thing we ask: when you send your thousand knights with the sixty thousand florins, send also a letter to the Emperor. In your own hand. Let him read your words directly. Let him see the man who offers such aid. We will carry your message, but your own voice will speak more powerfully than ours."

Isidore moved toward the door, then turned back.

"Your Majesty, you have given Constantinople something it has not had in many years: hope grounded in reality rather than desperate fantasy. Whether we choose to fight, to migrate, or to die with honor—at least now we have genuine choices before us. This is your gift, beyond the florins and the soldiers."

Bessarion bowed—deeper than before, a gesture of genuine respect.

"We will not burden you further today. You have much to consider, much to plan. The order to Castile, the letter to the Emperor, your other negotiations here at Basel. We are at your disposal should you need us. And we will pray—Orthodox prayers, but prayers nonetheless—for Queen Isabel's safe delivery. May God grant her and the child health, and may He grant you wisdom for the path ahead."

Both men stood formally, ready to depart unless you had more to discuss.

before you go, please tell me how the emperor and his family is doing? I dont really know about the emperor to be honest.

Excavated historical details about Byzantine emperor and succession concerns



Bessarion paused at the door, exchanging a glance with Isidore. Both men returned to their seats, their expressions suggesting this was a question they were glad you asked.

"Emperor John VIII Palaiologos," Bessarion began, settling back into his chair. "He is forty-one years old. A serious man. Thoughtful. Some say too thoughtful—he deliberates when others wish he would act. But in our situation, rashness would have doomed us years ago."

Isidore added, "He inherited the throne from his father Manuel II in 1425. Manuel was a wise emperor who spent his reign desperately seeking Western aid—even traveled to England and France himself, decades ago. John continues his father's work. It is all he can do."

Bessarion's expression grew more somber.

"His personal situation is... difficult. He has been married three times. His first wife, Anna of Moscow, died young—1417. His second wife, Sophia of Montferrat, left him after only a few years. She entered a convent. The marriage was... unhappy. His current wife is Maria of Trebizond. They married in 1427."

He paused significantly.

"Your Majesty, there is something you must understand. Emperor John has no children. No heir. This weighs heavily on him and on the empire. His brothers—Constantine, Theodore, Demetrios, Thomas—they wait in the wings. The succession is uncertain."

Isidore's voice was quiet.

"A childless emperor defending a dying empire. You see why hope has been scarce in Constantinople."

Bessarion continued, "John is educated, cultured. He speaks Latin adequately. He understands Western politics better than most of his predecessors. He is not hostile to the Latin Church—he is pragmatic. He knows that theological purity means nothing if Constantinople falls to the Turks."

"But he is also proud," Isidore interjected. "Proud of his lineage—he traces his authority back to Constantine the Great, to Augustus himself. He is the Roman Emperor, in his own mind. Asking him to surrender authority, even military authority, to a foreign king..." He shook his head. "It will not be easy for him to accept."

Bessarion nodded.

"He is also exhausted, Your Majesty. Eight years on the throne, each year worse than the last. Watching his empire shrink. Begging Western lords who lecture him about theology while his people starve. He sent us here to Basel with instructions to secure aid by any means possible—but 'any means' has limits even for desperate men."

The younger metropolitan's voice softened.

"When you meet him—if you meet him—you will find a man who carries impossible weight. Who loves his people but cannot save them. Who rules an empire that exists more in memory than in reality. He will test you, Your Majesty. Not from hostility, but from the caution of a man who has been disappointed too many times."

Isidore stood again.

"But if you speak to him as you have spoken to us—with honesty, with concrete offers, without demanding he abandon his faith—he will listen. He is not a fool. He knows Constantinople's survival depends on Western aid. He simply needs to believe that aid comes without chains."

Bessarion rose as well.

"One more thing. The Emperor's brother Constantine—he is the warrior of the family. Commands what military forces remain. If you propose war, Constantine will be your liaison with Byzantine forces. He is brave, capable, respected by the soldiers. If you win Constantine's trust, you win the army's trust."

He bowed again.

"Is there anything else you would know, Your Majesty?"

Lets wrap up the chapter here. 

Create a new document and put a summary of all events of this chat in it. Name it "Chapter 2.3"

Assembled chapter summary document for user delivery





I've created a comprehensive summary of Chapter 2.3.

View your Chapter 2.3 Summary

The chapter covers your evening briefing with Abbott Rodrigo about the Council's complexities, your morning prayer encounter with Cardinal Cesarini, and the crucial meeting with the Byzantine Metropolitans where you made concrete commitments of 1,000 knights and 60,000 florins for wall repairs—the first Western lord in eight months to offer substance rather than theological demands.

Chapter 2 3 summary

GM: lets recap this chapter. Phew! you really made me work for it. Some interesting rolls and convincing both the cardinal and even the byzantines who are desperate for any help took enormous effort. What do you think?

16 nov 2025

Analyzed narrative tension from challenging rolls and realistic NPC resistance




GM Reflection: Chapter 2.3

You're absolutely right to note the difficulty! This chapter was a masterclass in earning trust rather than being given it. Let me break down what made this so interesting:

THE ABBOTT (Roll: 46)

Even though he's your delegation chief who should theoretically support you, Rodrigo didn't just roll over and agree with your reform proposal. He saw merit but systematically dismantled the weak points. You had to think through:

What about already-passed decrees?
What does "temporary" mean?
What happens when the Pope disagrees?
Who proposes this to Rome?
Your answers to these actually improved your position. By the end, you had a much more robust framework than when you started. That's realistic mentorship - a good advisor challenges you to strengthen your thinking.

CARDINAL CESARINI (Rolls: 96 finding him, then 52, then 35)

This was fascinating. You rolled a 96 to find him weeping - an incredibly vulnerable moment. But then rolls of 52 and 35 meant he retreated into professional distance despite that vulnerability.

This is psychologically perfect. A senior churchman caught sobbing by a foreign king would be mortified. His instinct is to reassemble his dignity, not open up further. Even your emotional prayer (which was genuinely moving) didn't crack his defenses because he'd already been exposed once and wasn't going to let it happen again.

What you got was real: formal blessing, standard spiritual counsel, a hint of his burden ("some days God feels very far"), but no true connection. Yet. The seed is planted - he knows you're genuine. That may matter later.

THE BYZANTINES (Rolls: 3, then 66, then 80, then 61)

Here's where things got brutal. These men are desperate. Constantinople is dying. They need help urgently. And yet...

Roll of 3. Bitter, hostile, practically sneering. "Eight months of nothing, and you want to 'get to know us'?"

This seems counterintuitive - shouldn't desperate people be grateful for any offer? But it's deeply realistic:

They've been burned by eight months of empty Western promises
The Fourth Crusade trauma (last "help" sacked their city)
Pride mixed with desperation creates anger, not gratitude
Your vague "willingness to help" sounded like more of the same
You had to earn every inch of trust:

Concrete numbers (500k florins, 1000 knights, 5000 Military Order troops)
NO theological conditions (addressing their core fear)
The papal decree as PROOF of authority
Admitting uncertainties honestly
Asking what THEY need rather than telling them what you'll give
Respecting that only the Emperor can decide
By the end, you'd built genuine partnership - but it took the entire conversation and increasingly specific commitments. The roll of 80 at the end ("Real Trust Forming") was earned, not given.

WHAT THIS MEANS

NPCs have psychology. The Byzantines' bitterness, Cesarini's defensiveness, the Abbott's challenging nature - these aren't obstacles, they're people reacting as real humans would.
Desperation ≠ Compliance. Drowning people don't always grab the first rope. Sometimes they're so traumatized they need to be sure the rope won't become a noose.
Your honesty is your superpower. Every time you admitted limitations, acknowledged risks, or confessed uncertainty, trust grew. Your "What if I am wrong?" resonates because nobody else asks it.
Concrete beats abstract. The moment you said "60,000 florins for walls - done" changed everything. Not "we'll help somehow" but "this exact amount for this exact purpose, I'll write the order tonight."
The spiritual struggle matters. Your morning prayer and genuine wrestling with faith aren't just flavor - they're making you a different kind of leader. The Byzantines noticed you didn't demand theological submission. Cesarini noticed you sought guidance rather than assumed righteousness.
CHALLENGES AHEAD

The Pope still needs to release those 315k+ florins - that's not automatic
The Council still needs addressing - and that reform proposal will face resistance
Emperor John VIII will test you even harder than the metropolitans did
Isabel's delivery creates real timeline pressure
And somewhere in all this, you're still wrestling with whether your grand ambitions are divine calling or dangerous pride
VERDICT

This chapter showed what realistic historical roleplay looks like. You didn't waltz in and charm everyone with your Granada reputation. You had to work, adapt, think on your feet, and prove yourself through substance rather than rhetoric. The trust you've built with the Byzantines is fragile - it's based on promises not yet delivered.

But it's real, which is far more valuable than easy.

Excellent work. Now comes the hard part: delivering on what you've promised while preventing the Church from tearing itself apart.
