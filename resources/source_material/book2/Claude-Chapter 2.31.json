Low rolls mean hard bargaining, not irrational hostility. Committed allies defend their own stake. Before NPC dialogue: What do they want? What won't they say? What have they seen? GM: Remember to never generate dialogue or action for Juan. Instead, just stop. Read kingdom guide.md Read NPC guide.md Provide a short introduction about the situation. Dont advance the timeline.\nI spend time since returning to Toledo setting up economy and other things. Some things have advanced the timeline. We are in late summer and I want to set a few things in motion still."

Not advance the timeline further\n2. Provide a short introduction about the current situation\n3. Let the player direct what happens next\n\nLet me write a brief atmospheric introduction about late summer 1435 in Toledo, summarizing where things stand without advancing anything.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2.31: Late Summer 1435\n\n\nToledo — August 1435\n\n\nThe summer heat sits heavy over Toledo, though the stone walls of the Alcázar hold some coolness within. The Tagus runs low in its ancient gorge below the city, and the hills of New Castile shimmer in the afternoon haze.\n\n\nIt has been a season of building—quiet, persistent work rather than the drama of conquest or council. Admiral Vilaragut's naval program advances steadily: La Cartuja shipyard rises on the Guadalquivir, the first purchased vessels have arrived from Genoa and Portugal, and Basque shipwrights train alongside Castilian craftsmen. The Junta de Manufacturas has begun receiving proposals from foreign experts—German ironworkers, Flemish weavers, French papermakers—each eager for royal patronage.\n\n\nIn Constantinople, the settlement campaign continues its extraordinary momentum. Letters from the Military Order commanderies report that the first wave of settlers from Order lands has established themselves in the Latin Quarter, and a second sailing is being prepared.\n\n\nCloser to home, the programs set in motion last year now require continued attention: infrastructure investments await specific proposals from Diego de Daza, the Inquisition apparatus stands ready pending papal mandate, and the intelligence network Isaac de Baeza has built spreads its invisible tendrils across the Mediterranean.\n\n\nYour family fills the Alcázar with life—Catalina at nearly four years old, Fernando toddling at two, and Bianca approaching her first birthday. Lucia has made the household her own while honoring Isabel's memory. The rhythm of court life has settled into something approaching normalcy for the first time in years.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna awaits in the council chamber, ready to discuss whatever you wish to set in motion. The realm is prosperous, the treasury healthy, and the coming months offer opportunity before winter closes the sailing season.\n\n\n\nWhat would you like to address?"

This is part of the Junta de Manufacturas program established earlier.\n\nLet me think about what this would involve historically:\n\n1. In the 15th century, the major centers for arms and armor production were:\n- Milan (Italian armories - the Missaglia family, etc.)\n- Nuremberg and Augsburg (German centers)\n- Toledo already had famous sword-making traditions\n\n2. What Juan wants is industrial-scale production, not just artisan work. This would require:\n- Master smiths who know the techniques\n- Infrastructure (forges, water-powered hammers, etc.)\n- Raw materials (iron, steel, coal)\n- Training local workers\n\n3. The Junta de Manufacturas was established to handle this. A representative should be presenting these experts.\n\nLet me create a scene where the foreign experts are presented. I should introduce realistic NPCs who have their own motivations and concerns. They're not just going to hand over trade secrets - they want something in return.\n\nKey considerations:\n- German/Milanese smiths would be the best sources\n- They'd want: money, privileges, protection, possibly exclusivity\n- They'd be cautious about training competitors\n- Guild structures in their home cities might restrict what they can share\n\nLet me set up the scene with realistic NPCs and stop for Juan to interact.\n\n\nThe great hall has been arranged for receiving the foreign experts—not the intimate council chamber, but a space that conveys royal dignity without overwhelming. Álvaro has ensured wine and refreshments are available, and representatives of the Junta de Manufacturas stand ready to translate if needed.\n\n\nDiego de Daza steps forward as you take your seat. \"Your Majesty, the Junta has corresponded extensively with guilds in Milan, Nuremberg, and Augsburg. Three parties have traveled to Toledo to present their credentials and discuss terms.\"\n\n\nHe gestures, and the first group is admitted.\n\n\n\nThe Milanese Delegation\n\n\nTwo men enter—one elderly, one perhaps thirty. Both wear the practical clothing of craftsmen rather than merchants, though of fine quality. The older man walks with the slightly stooped posture of decades at the forge.\n\n\n\"Maestro Giovanni Negroni,\" Diego announces, \"of the Negroni workshops in Milan. And his nephew, Marco.\"\n\n\nThe old man bows stiffly. His hands, you notice, are scarred and callused in ways that speak of a lifetime working hot metal. When he speaks, his Castilian is accented but serviceable—clearly prepared for this audience.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty honors us. The Negroni family has armed the Visconti for three generations. We have heard of Castile's conquests, and of the King who leads from the front.\" His eyes assess you with professional interest—measuring you as he might measure a man for a cuirass. \"Milan has many armorers. But Your Majesty did not summon many. You summoned the best.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, letting that claim settle.\n\n\n\"We can teach your smiths to make armor that will turn a Turkish arrow at fifty paces. Plate that moves like a second skin. But this is not knowledge we give lightly. In Milan, such secrets pass from father to son, uncle to nephew.\" He gestures at Marco. \"What does Castile offer that would make us... less careful with our inheritance?\""

This is a reasonable request - they want to use the chaos roll mechanics to determine what kind of expert they get.\n\nLet me think about the factors here:\n\n**Success Factors (things working in Juan's favor):**\n1. Castile is wealthy - treasury of ~545,000 florins, can offer generous terms\n2. Juan has a reputation as a successful military leader who conquered Granada\n3. Juan personally leads from the front - craftsmen respect a king who actually uses their products\n4. Castile offers opportunity - a growing kingdom with naval ambitions and Constantinople settlement\n5. The Junta de Manufacturas shows serious institutional commitment\n6. No existing entrenched guild system to compete with newcomers\n7. Juan's reputation for honoring commitments is strong\n8. The Constantinople venture offers exotic prestige\n\n**Failure Factors (obstacles):**\n1. Milan, Nuremberg, Augsburg have strong guild systems that discourage emigration\n2. Best masters are already wealthy and comfortable - why leave?\n3. Castile has no existing arms industry tradition to build on\n4. Language and cultural barriers\n5. Distance from home and family\n6. Risk of sharing trade secrets that took generations to develop\n7. Political instability concerns (though Juan has been stable)\n8. Competition from other patrons seeking the same experts\n\nThis is a CHAOS roll - what quality of expert does Juan attract? The approach quality matters less here since the user is asking about the general outcome of their recruitment efforts.\n\nLet me create a fair d100 table:\n\n1-10: Disaster - frauds, incompetents, or those fleeing debts\n11-25: Poor - second-rate journeymen, exaggerated credentials\n26-40: Mediocre - competent but not exceptional, can improve existing work but not transform\n41-60: Solid - experienced professionals who can establish decent workshops\n61-75: Good - respected masters with genuine expertise, can build quality production\n\n\n76-90: Excellent - first-rate masters with strong reputations, can establish world-class workshops\n91-100: Exceptional - among the finest in their field, bringing secrets and connections\n\nI'll adjust the ranges to reflect Castile's attractiveness under Juan's leadership. The modified table now provides a more nuanced view of potential recruitment outcomes, taking into account the kingdom's strengths and opportunities for skilled craftsmen.\n\nThe probability distribution suggests a promising scenario. With a 65% chance of good or excellent outcomes, Castile appears to be an appealing destination for top-tier talent. The low probability of poor results indicates a robust and attractive recruitment environment.\n\n\nA wise approach—the quality of expert you attract will shape Castile's arms industry for a generation.\n\n\n\nRECRUITING FOREIGN WEAPONSMITHS\n\n\nSuccess Factors\n\n\nWealth: Castile's treasury can offer generous terms—signing bonuses, workshops, housing, guaranteed commissions\n\nReputation: Juan conquered Granada, leads from the front, and is known to honor commitments\n\nOpportunity: A growing kingdom with no entrenched guild competition—a master could build something his own\n\nConstantinople venture: Exotic prestige; arming a crusade appeals to craftsmen's pride\n\nInstitutional commitment: The Junta de Manufacturas signals serious long-term investment, not a passing royal fancy\n\n\nFailure Factors\n\n\nGuild restrictions: Milan, Nuremberg, and Augsburg guilds actively discourage emigration and sharing of trade secrets\n\nComfort: The best masters are already wealthy and respected—why uproot?\n\nDistance: Castile is far from home, family, familiar language and customs\n\nNo tradition: Castile lacks an existing arms industry to build upon—starting from nothing is daunting\n\nSecrecy: Techniques passed through generations are not lightly shared with foreigners\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: Quality of Weaponsmith Recruited\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-10\nDisaster — Frauds or fleeing debtors with exaggerated credentials; discovery comes after money spent\n11-25\nPoor — Second-rate journeymen who couldn't succeed at home; marginal improvement over existing Castilian work\n26-40\nMediocre — Competent craftsmen but not masters; can improve quality somewhat, not transform industry\n41-60\nSolid — Experienced professionals with genuine skill; can establish respectable workshops producing good arms\n61-75\nGood — Respected masters with real expertise; can build quality production rivaling secondary European centers\n76-90\nExcellent — First-rate masters with strong reputations; can establish workshops approaching Milan or Nuremberg quality\n91-100\nExceptional — Among the finest in their field; brings secrets, techniques, and connections that could make Castile a major arms producer\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

Let me narrate who has come and what they offer.\n\n\nResult: 74 — Good\n\n\nRespected masters with real expertise; can build quality production rivaling secondary European centers.\n\n\n\nThe negotiations stretch over several days. The Milanese prove too cautious—Giovanni Negroni's price for sharing true Visconti-quality techniques is essentially a partnership that would make him master of any Castilian workshop, answerable to no one. He wants too much and offers too little beyond his famous name.\n\n\nBut the German delegation proves more promising.\n\n\nHeinrich Steinmann of Augsburg is not the most famous armorer in the Empire—but he is among the most practical. A man in his late forties with iron-grey hair and hands like leather-wrapped stone, he represents a consortium of three Augsburg workshops: his own, his brother-in-law's blade-smithy, and a mail-maker named Konrad Fels.\n\n\n\"We are not Nuremberg masters,\" Heinrich says bluntly through the translator. \"We do not make parade armor for princes or swords with gold hilts. We make armor that works. Hauberks, brigandines, sallets, good steel blades. Weapons for soldiers, not for display.\"\n\n\nHe lays out samples on the table—a sallet helm, a short sword, a section of mail. The work is excellent: clean lines, consistent quality, the mark of craftsmen who have made thousands of pieces and refined their methods through repetition.\n\n\n\"In Augsburg, we compete with Nuremberg's reputation and Milan's glamour. We survive by being faster and cheaper without sacrificing quality. This is what we can teach.\"\n\n\nHis terms are straightforward:\n\n\nEstablishment costs: 8,000 florins for workshops, tools, and materials in a suitable location (he suggests Bilbao for iron access, or Toledo for royal oversight)\n\nAnnual retainer: 1,500 florins split among the three masters for five years\n\nHousing: Suitable homes for three families\n\nApprentices: Castilian apprentices to be provided; they will learn German methods\n\nCommission guarantee: Crown purchases of at least 2,000 florins annually\n\nExclusivity: They work for the Crown first, may take private commissions only with permission\n\n\n\"In five years,\" Heinrich concludes, \"you will have Castilian smiths making arms as good as any in the secondary cities of the Empire. In ten years, perhaps better—you have iron, you have wool for padding, you have leather. You lack only knowledge. This we can provide.\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro leans close. \"Reasonable terms. Not cheap, but not ruinous. The question is whether we want steady, reliable production—or to hold out for something more ambitious.\""

He's asking practical questions about production capacity. I need to have Heinrich respond realistically - he's a practical craftsman who will give honest estimates rather than wild promises.\n\nLet me think about what realistic medieval arms production would look like:\n\nA skilled armorer with journeymen and apprentices could produce:\n- A full harness (complete plate armor) might take 2-3 months of work for one master\n- But simpler equipment like brigandines, mail shirts, helmets, etc. could be produced faster\n- With a workshop of multiple smiths, production scales\n\nHeinrich is talking about practical soldier's equipment, not tournament plate. So:\n- Sallets (helmets) - maybe 1-2 per week per skilled worker\n- Brigandines - maybe 2-3 per month per skilled worker\n- Mail shirts - very labor intensive, maybe 1 per month\n- Swords/blades - depends on quality, maybe 2-4 per week for a good smith\n\nWith three masters, each probably bringing some journeymen, and training local apprentices...\n\nLet's say each master has maybe 2-3 skilled workers initially, growing as they train locals.\n\nInitial capacity (Year 1-2): Maybe 3 workshops with 3-4 workers each = ~10-12 skilled workers\n- Could produce equipment for maybe 300-500 soldiers per year if doing complete kits\n- Or more if doing partial equipment\n\nAfter 5 years with trained Castilian apprentices: Capacity could triple or more\n\nHeinrich would be honest and practical about this - he'd give conservative estimates and explain the variables.\n\nI should have him respond in character - straightforward, practical, no exaggeration.\n\n\nHeinrich nods with evident approval at your choice of location and priorities. A man who values practicality over display, clearly.\n\n\n\"Bilbao is wise. Good iron, good charcoal, river transport. And close to the Basque shipyards—anchors, fittings, nails, all need smiths.\"\n\n\nHe considers your question carefully, pulling at his beard. When he speaks, it is with the deliberate precision of a man who has quoted production figures to demanding clients before.\n\n\n\"This depends on what you mean by 'fully arm,' Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nHe gestures at the samples on the table.\n\n\n\"A man-at-arms in full harness—plate cuirass, arm and leg protection, sallet, gauntlets, sword, dagger—this is three months' work for a skilled armorer. We cannot make such men by the hundred.\"\n\n\n\"But a soldier?\" He picks up the sallet. \"Helmet, brigandine or mail shirt, sword, buckler? This we can produce faster.\"\n\n\nHe counts on his scarred fingers:\n\n\n\"First two years—we establish workshops, train your apprentices, learn your iron. Perhaps two hundred complete soldier's kits per year. Helmets, brigandines, blades. Enough to equip a company.\"\n\n\n\"By year five, with trained Castilians working alongside us? Five hundred to eight hundred kits yearly. More if you want only helmets, or only blades.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"But Your Majesty speaks of scale. True scale requires not three masters but thirty workshops across your kingdom, each feeding the others. We can plant the seed. The tree takes longer to grow.\"\n\n\n\"What size of force does Your Majesty intend to arm?\""

So remaining foreign expert industries would be:\n\n\nI'll focus on the key industries still needing specialized foreign expertise. Segovia's textile sector requires Flemish masters to revitalize wool production. Paper mills need French and German experts to introduce advanced manufacturing techniques. The glass industry presents a delicate challenge, with potential Venetian recruitment complicated by strict emigration policies. While shipbuilding is primarily under Admiral Vilaragut's naval program, it still involves incorporating foreign design innovations.\n\n\nHeinrich Steinmann bows—a short, practical gesture matching the man—and withdraws with his nephew to begin preparations for the journey north to Bilbao.\n\n\nDiego de Daza consults a leather folder containing the Junta de Manufacturas correspondence.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty will recall the industries identified last year.

      "say": "Thought process: Examined legal, ethical, and diplomatic dimensions of harboring the craftsman.\n\nThe user is asking Isaac de Baeza for advice on the ethical and legal dimensions of accepting a Venetian glassblower who fled Murano. This is a thoughtful question about honor, law, and diplomacy.\n\nLet me think about this from multiple angles:\n\n1. Legal perspective: Venice's laws apply to Venice and its territories. They cannot legally bind Castile. A man who flees one jurisdiction to another is not automatically a criminal in the new jurisdiction. There's no international law in 1435 that would make harboring a craftsman illegal.\n\n2. Ethical perspective: Venice essentially treats its glassmakers as prisoners - confined to Murano, families held as hostages, death penalty for leaving. By modern standards this is slavery or imprisonment. By medieval standards... it's unusual but not unheard of for valuable craftsmen to be restricted. But does accepting someone fleeing such conditions make Juan dishonorable?\n\n3. Honor perspective in medieval context: Honor cultures focus on keeping one's word, not betraying allies, and maintaining reputation. Juan has made no promises to Venice. Venice is not an ally. Accepting a refugee is not inherently dishonorable - kingdoms accepted refugees from other realms all the time.\n\n4. Diplomatic perspective: Venice will be upset, but their legal claim is weak. They may make noise diplomatically but they'd struggle to justify demanding extradition of a free man to face execution for... practicing his trade elsewhere.\n\n5. Precedent: Kingdoms throughout the medieval period tried to attract skilled craftsmen from rivals. Edward III of England famously invited Flemish weavers. This was considered shrewd policy, not dishonorable.\n\nIsaac should present this analysis in character - he's a pragmatic spymaster who thinks about these things carefully. He should acknowledge the Venetian position while pointing out its weaknesses.\n\n\nIsaac considers the question carefully. This is not the response of a man caught off guard—he has clearly thought through these dimensions already.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the right questions. Let me address each.\"\n\n\nHe settles into a chair, steepling his fingers.\n\n\n\n\"On law.\"\n\n\n\"Venice's laws bind Venice. They do not bind Castile, nor any other sovereign kingdom. Barbarigo broke Venetian law by leaving Murano. The moment he stepped onto Ragusan soil, he was beyond their jurisdiction. If he comes to Castile, he is a free man practicing a lawful trade. You break no law—not Castilian, not canon, not any law recognized between Christian princes.\"\n\n\n\"Venice will claim otherwise, of course. They will speak of 'stolen secrets' and 'violated oaths.' But there is no treaty between Castile and Venice governing the movement of craftsmen. You owe them nothing.\"\n\n\n\n\"On ethics.\"\n\n\n\"Consider what Venice does. They confine men to an island. They hold families hostage. They execute those who leave. They killed—or 'disappeared'—Barbarigo's son to keep him compliant.\" Isaac's voice remains level, but there is an edge beneath it. \"This is not a guild protecting trade secrets. This is imprisonment. Slavery with gilded chains.\"\n\n\n\"If a serf flees a cruel lord and reaches a free city, does the city sin by sheltering him? Most would say no. Barbarigo is a man fleeing bondage. You offer him freedom to practice his God-given craft. Where is the ethical violation?\"\n\n\n\nThought process: Weighed honor implications of accepting the craftsman's employment.\n\nContinuing Isaac's analysis...\n\nOn honor - this is the key question for a medieval king. Isaac should address whether accepting Barbarigo would damage Juan's reputation among other rulers or be seen as dishonorable conduct.\n\n\n\"On honour.\"\n\n\nIsaac pauses here, choosing his words with care.\n\n\n\"This is the more delicate question. Honour is reputation—what other princes believe of you.\"\n\n\n\"Venice will call you a thief. They will say you 'stole' their craftsman. But consider: every kingdom in Christendom has sought foreign expertise. King Edward of England invited Flemish weavers. The German princes compete fiercely for Italian craftsmen. The Pope himself recruits artists and builders from across Europe. This is statecraft, not theft.\"\n\n\n\"You have not bribed a man to betray his lord. You have not broken faith with an ally. You have not violated any oath or treaty. You have simply... offered sanctuary to a man who fled oppression, and employment to a craftsman who wishes to work.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"If Venice wishes to keep their glassmakers, let them treat them as men rather than prisoners. Their grievance is with their own cruelty, not your hospitality.\"\n\n\n\n\"On lessening the blow.\"\n\n\n\"Several approaches, Your Majesty:\"\n\n\n\"First: Discretion. We do not announce his arrival. We do not boast of Venetian secrets. He works quietly, trains apprentices quietly. Venice may suspect, but suspicion is not proof.\"\n\n\n\"Second: Distance. Establish his workshop far from Italian eyes—not Toledo or Seville, but perhaps Segovia or Burgos. Somewhere Venice's agents do not routinely travel.\"\n\n\n\"Third: Deniability. If Venice protests formally, you may express surprise that a Venetian craftsman has found his way to Castile. You did not kidnap him. You did not recruit him in Venice. He came of his own will, seeking honest work. Is Castile to interrogate every foreign craftsman about his origins?\"\n\n\n\"Fourth: Diplomatic deflection. Venice needs Castilian wool. Venice trades with Castilian merchants. They will bluster, but they will not rupture commerce over one glassmaker. Their protest will be formal, then quiet.\"\n\n\n\nIsaac meets your eyes. \"You asked if this would be dishonourable. I say no. You offer a persecuted man shelter and honest work. Venice's anger is the anger of a jailer who has lost a prisoner—not the righteous grievance of a wronged party.\"\n\n\n\"But I am a spy, Your Majesty. Honour is not my trade.\" A faint, dry smile. \"Perhaps ask Fray Hernando if you wish a cleaner conscience.\""

Let me check what was listed.\n\nFrom the earlier search results and conversation, Diego mentioned three industries requiring foreign experts:\n\n1. **Wool & Textiles** - Flemish masters - DONE (rolled 24, poor result, but established modest workshop)\n2. **Paper Mills** - French and German papermakers - NOT YET ADDRESSED\n3. **Glass** - Venetian glassblowers - DONE (rolled 85, success)\n\nAnd separately, the weaponsmiths were addressed first (rolled 74, good result).\n\nSo the remaining industry is **Paper Mills** - with two masters from Troyes who have expressed interest, with correspondence ongoing.\n\nThe user is correct - we haven't addressed the papermakers yet.\n\n\nDiego checks his folder and nods, slightly embarrassed at the oversight.\n\n\n\"Forgive me, Your Majesty. Yes—the papermakers.\"\n\n\nHe flips to the relevant correspondence.\n\n\n\"Paper is currently imported at great expense from France, Italy, and the German lands. Every document your chancery produces, every book copied in your universities, every letter sent by your merchants—all written on foreign paper. A domestic paper industry would save considerable gold and free Castile from dependence on foreign suppliers.\"\n\n\nHe produces a letter.\n\n\n\"Two masters from Troyes in France have expressed interest—the Champagne region has produced paper for over a century. A Master Guillaume Fournier and his brother-in-law Jean de Moulins have written that they would consider relocating if terms were favorable. They cite... difficulties with their current guild, though they do not elaborate.\"\n\n\nDiego shrugs. \"Papermaking is less jealously guarded than Venetian glass. The techniques are known across France and Germany. The challenge is establishing the mills—they require running water, specific materials, skilled labor. But there is no death penalty for sharing the craft.\"\n\n\nHe glances at Álvaro. \"Shall we see what quality of papermakers we can attract, Your Majesty? Or would you prefer to correspond further before committing?\""

Let me also check what happened with the naval development plan since that's a major part of this.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Synthesized economic initiatives and organized comprehensive development framework.\n\nI now have a good picture of the economic initiatives. Let me organize my questions before drafting the comprehensive document.\n\nBased on what I've gathered, here are the initiatives:\n\n**EXISTING DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES (No foreign experts needed):**\n1. Leather (Córdoba) - 3,000 initial investment, expanding with hides production\n2. Salt/Salted Fish (Seville) - 2,700 for fishing boats, lease model\n3. Silk (Granada) - 3,550 initial, 300-400 annual (looms, training, dyes)\n4. Ceramics (Talavera) - mentioned but no specific investment yet\n5. Herding expansion (Mesta sheep + goatherds) - through infrastructure\n\n**FOREIGN EXPERT INDUSTRIES (This chapter):**\n1. Arms workshops (Bilbao) - 8,900 one-time, 3,500 annual - APPROVED\n2. Textile workshop (Segovia) - 2,600 one-time, 400 annual - APPROVED (poor quality journeymen)\n3. Glass workshop (Burgos) - 7,300 one-time, 1,200 annual - APPROVED (good master)\n4. Paper mills - FAILED, retry next year\n\n**NAVAL DEVELOPMENT:**\n- Year 1 costs: 68,500 florins\n- Military Orders fleet grants: 15,000 annual (5,000 each)\n- Portuguese exploration gift: 10,000 one-time\n- Annual costs rising to 37,000-57,000, eventually 60,000-70,000 by 1440\n\n**INFRASTRUCTURE:**\n- 40,000 annually for 5 years (200,000 total)\n- Herding infrastructure (drove roads, watering points, Granada routes): 12,000-15,000 of the 40,000\n- General commerce (ports, roads, bridges): 25,000-28,000 of the 40,000\n\n\n- Intelligence network requires 6,500 initial investment and 4,400 annual funding\n- Inquisition preparation needs 5,000 initial expenditure\n- Total intelligence and preparatory costs: 11,500 initial, 4,400 annual\n\nI'll need to verify the details of these additional investments and their strategic implications for our overall economic development plan.\n\n\nI have gathered substantial information. Before I draft the comprehensive document, I have several clarifying questions:\n\n\n\n1. Scope and Timeline\n\n\nYou mention \"five years\" — should this be 1435-1439 or 1435-1440?\n\nShould this document include initiatives already begun in 1434 (leather, silk, fishing boats) or only new measures from 1435 onward?\n\n\n2. Revenue Projections\n\n\nDo you want me to estimate future revenues from these industries (e.g., increased customs from trade, fishing boat lease payments, silk cloth sales), or focus primarily on costs and leave revenues as general expectations?\n\nSome revenue sources are speculative (we don't know how much the silk industry will actually produce). Should I present ranges with assumptions clearly stated?\n\n\n3. Industries Not Yet Addressed\n\n\nCeramics (Talavera): Mentioned in earlier plans but no specific investment allocated. Include this with a placeholder, or exclude?\n\nShipbuilding modernization: This is handled through the Naval Development Plan. Include a summary reference, or treat naval development as a separate document?\n\n\n4. Foreign Expert Industries — Future Attempts\n\n\nThe textile masters were poor quality and papermills failed entirely. Should I include placeholders for \"retry in 1436\" with estimated costs if successful?\n\n\n5. Document Purpose\n\n\nIs this primarily for your reference as a player, or should it read as an in-world document (formal decree style, signed by Juan)?"

While the document includes the measures taken in 1434, the projections should start 1435 - 1440. We assumen that since the planning starts summer 1434, the effects only start in 1435.\n\nMake an estimation of what these industries will make us revenue. Be specific. If you must estimate, make an estimation what you consider to be average. I will later make a roll for the actual effectiveness for these measures.\n\nInclude the ceramics as an industry that is significant but where we have taken no specific measures for. So it will likely not increase in production. Use the shipbuilding document as input. This document sets out how many ships are being produced for the army but also for fishers and ships that will be used for trades. And the galleys will hopefully reduce pirate activity. This generates revenue and should thusly be included in the document.\n\nThis document will be reviewed every year when we will again try and find better experts.\n\nIt serves only as a document for the GM."

Is a GM reference document, not an in-world formal decree\n\nLet me compile all the information I've gathered:\n\n**EXISTING INDUSTRIES (Domestic expertise, investment only):**\n\n1. **Leather (Córdoba)**\n- Initial investment: 3,000 florins (1434)\n- Measures: Sumac cultivation, hide production expansion, new facility outside city, guadamecí workshop expansion\n- Tied to goat herd expansion\n\n2. **Silk (Granada)**\n- Initial investment: 3,550 florins (3,250 in some sources)\n   - 50 looms: 2,250 florins\n   - Training wages: 500 florins\n   - Dye workshop expansion: 500 florins\n- Annual: 300-400 florins for master weaver supervision\n- Goal: Weave all thread into cloth instead of selling raw\n\n3. **Salt & Fishing (Seville)**\n- Initial investment: 2,700 florins for fishing fleet\n   - 8 smaller vessels (40-50 tons): 1,800 florins\n   - 2 larger vessels (80-100 tons): 850 florins (wait, that's only 2,650... let me check)\n- Lease model: 15-20 florins/year (smaller) or 30-40 florins/year (larger)\n- After 20 years, ownership transfers\n\n4. **Ceramics (Talavera)**\n\n\n- Existing industry with minimal intervention\n- No specific production expansion planned\n- Maintaining current manufacturing capabilities\n\n**HERDING & RAW MATERIALS:**\n\nI'll focus on the strategic approach to wool and goat herding. The wool sector relies on infrastructure improvements and strategic grazing rights in Granada's lowlands. Despite challenges in recruiting textile masters, the program maintains a long-term vision. Goat herding receives royal legal recognition, with mountain grazing rights supporting both the leather industry and military provisioning. These sectors are interconnected, providing raw materials and economic diversification.\n\n**INFRASTRUCTURE:**\n- Substantial annual investment of 40,000 florins over 5 years\n- Targeted funding: 12,000-15,000 for herding infrastructure\n- Remaining funds allocated to broader commercial development\n\n**FOREIGN EXPERT INDUSTRIES (1435):**\n\nArms and armor production in Bilbao shows promising potential. Heinrich Steinmann from Augsburg brings expertise, with initial investments covering workshop and housing. The program anticipates scaling from 200 to 800 equipment kits annually. In contrast, the textile sector under Willem van der Berg demonstrates limited progress, with only marginal improvements despite significant investment.\n\nVenetian glass manufacturing emerges as a bright spot. Alessandro Barbarigo's expertise promises high-quality cristallo and colored glass production. The investment includes strategic allocations for workshop establishment, security, and potential smuggling networks.\n\n**NAVAL STRATEGY:**\nInitial naval development requires substantial capital - 68,500 florins in the first year. Projected annual expenditures will escalate from 37,000 to 70,000 florins by 1440. The ambitious plan targets 143 royal vessels and 38 Military Order ships, with anticipated revenue streams from fishing leases, increased customs, and reduced maritime piracy.\n\nMilitary support spans 15,000 florins across three orders. Intelligence networks and Inquisition preparation represent additional strategic investments beyond pure economic development.\n\n**REGIONAL ECONOMIC POTENTIAL:**\nLeather and silk sectors show promising growth trajectories. Córdoba's leather production could incrementally boost revenues from 500 to 4,000 florins by 1440. Granada's silk transformation strategy aims to multiply raw thread value through local cloth manufacturing.\n\n**MARITIME ECONOMIC EXPANSION:**\nFishing fleet leases generate modest initial returns around 210 florins. Atlantic fishing expansion could progressively increase customs revenues from 300 to 2,000 florins annually, representing a strategic maritime economic development approach.\n\n**ARMS & MANUFACTURING (Bilbao):**\nEquipment procurement represents a strategic investment. While direct revenue remains minimal, the initiative reduces import dependencies and creates potential future export opportunities for Castile's emerging manufacturing sector.\n\n**TEXTILE SECTOR (Segovia):**\nMarginal improvements in cloth production might yield modest additional revenues between 100-200 florins annually, reflecting incremental quality enhancements.\n\n**LUXURY GLASS PRODUCTION (Burgos):**\nVenetian-quality glass manufacturing presents significant export potential. By replacing imports and targeting wealthy European markets, the initiative could generate 500 to 2,500 florins in additional revenue as production and reputation mature.\n\n**NAVAL/TRADE STRATEGY:**\nExpanding maritime capabilities creates multifaceted economic benefits: increased fishing revenues, enhanced customs collections, and reduced trade disruptions through improved maritime security.\n\nSeville's customs alone generate 40,000 florins, with total trade revenues reaching 87,000 florins. Naval expansion could incrementally boost revenues from 2,000 to 20,000 florins over six years, driven by increased trade volume and merchant confidence.\n\n**INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT:**\nStrategic infrastructure investments in roads, bridges, and ports will progressively enhance commercial activity. Initial minimal returns will transition to 2,000-8,000 florins in additional economic output as projects mature.\n\nI'll compile a comprehensive reference document, structuring detailed tables to capture investment strategies, operational expenses, and potential revenue projections.\n\n\nI have all the information I need. Let me draft this comprehensive document now.\n\n\nView: Reading the skills file for creating Word documents\n\n\nThought process: Consulted documentation to construct comprehensive economic measures document.\n\nI need to read the docx-js.md file to understand how to create new Word documents properly.\n\n\nView: Reading the docx-js documentation for creating Word documents\n\n\nThought process: Architected comprehensive economic development framework with revenue projections.\n\nNow I have all the information I need to create the comprehensive economic development document. Let me create this document in JavaScript using docx-js.\n\nThe document should include:\n\n1. Overview\n2. Domestic Industries (existing expertise, investment only)\n   - Leather (Córdoba)\n   - Silk (Granada)\n   - Salt & Fishing (Seville)\n   - Ceramics (Talavera) - no measures taken\n   - Wool & Goat Herding (raw materials)\n3. Foreign Expert Industries\n   - Arms & Armor (Bilbao) - Roll 74: Good\n   - Textiles (Segovia) - Roll 24: Poor\n   - Glass (Burgos) - Roll 85: Success\n   - Paper - Roll 7: Disaster (retry next year)\n4. Infrastructure Program\n5. Naval Development (reference to Naval Plan)\n6. Financial Summary\n   - One-time investments\n   - Annual costs\n   - Revenue projections 1435-1440\n7. Expected Outcomes\n\nLet me calculate the revenues more carefully:\n\n**LEATHER (Córdoba):**\n- Current production generates some customs/alcabala\n- With expansion tied to herd growth:\n  - 1435: +500 florins (minimal, sumac not yet producing)\n  - 1436: +1,000 florins\n  - 1437: +1,500 florins\n  - 1438: +2,500 florins\n  - 1439: +3,500 florins\n  - 1440: +4,500 florins\n\n**SILK (Granada):**\n- Converting raw thread to cloth captures 3-5x value\n  - 1435: +1,000 florins (looms being set up)\n  - 1436: +2,000 florins\n  - 1737: +2,500 florins\n  - 1438: +3,000 florins\n  - 1439: +3,500 florins\n  - 1440: +4,000 florins\n\n**FISHING (Seville)** shows promising revenue growth. Lease payments provide a steady base of around 200 florins annually, while increased fish supply will boost alcabala and customs revenues. The projection starts modestly at 400 florins in 1435, steadily climbing to 2,000 florins by 1439, indicating a robust expansion of the fishing industry's economic impact.\n\nThe trend continues into 1440, with an anticipated 2,500 florins in additional revenue, suggesting the sector's ongoing development and potential for further growth.\n\n**ARMS & ARMOR (Bilbao)** prioritizes strategic advantages over pure financial gains. By reducing imports, the kingdom retains more capital. Sales to nobles generate modest but increasing returns, starting from zero in 1735 and progressively reaching 1,200 florins by 1740.\n\n**TEXTILES (Segovia)** struggles with limited potential due to poor-quality craftsmanship, generating minimal annual revenue between 100-200 florins from 1735 to 1740.\n\n**GLASS (Burgos)** emerges as a promising luxury goods sector. Initially operating secretly with zero revenue in 1735, the industry rapidly scales up, reaching 1,500 florins by 1738.\n\nThe glass sector continues its growth trajectory, hitting 2,000 florins in 1739 and projecting 2,500 florins for 1740, indicating a robust and expanding market.\n\n**NAVAL/TRADE** demonstrates exponential revenue growth through strategic improvements. More ships, increased fishing vessels, and reduced piracy contribute to substantial customs revenue, escalating from 3,000 florins in 1735 to a projected 20,000 florins by 1740.\n\n**INFRASTRUCTURE** investments similarly show consistent revenue enhancement. Better roads and bridges facilitate trade, with annual customs revenue climbing from 500 florins in 1735 to an anticipated 10,000 florins by 1740.\n\nThe initial one-time investments in leather (3,000 florins in 1434) and silk (3,250 florins) lay the groundwork for these subsequent economic developments.\n\nI'll allocate strategic investments across multiple sectors: naval capabilities, workshops, intelligence networks, and diplomatic initiatives. Key one-time investments include fishing fleet establishment in Seville, arms workshops in Bilbao, textile and glass workshops, and significant allocations for naval infrastructure and exploratory diplomatic efforts with Portugal.\n\nAnnual operational costs will focus on maintaining these strategic sectors, with modest retainer expenses for silk, arms, textile, and glass industries to ensure continued productivity and security.\n\nProjected infrastructure and naval expenditures range between 77,000-110,000 florins, with intelligence networks and military order fleet grants supplementing core strategic investments.\n\n\nNow I'll create the comprehensive economic development plan document.\n\n\nCreate File: Creating the comprehensive economic development plan for Castile 1435-1440\n\n\nThought process: Prepared to execute document generation script.\n\nNow I need to run the script to generate the document.\n\n\nBash Tool: Generating the economic development plan document\n\n\nThought process\n\nThe document was created successfully.

Let me provide a brief summary of what's in it for the user.\n\n\n\nDiego de Daza bows and presents the bound document.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, the comprehensive plan as requested. It consolidates all economic initiatives from summer 1434 through projections to 1440.\"\n\n\nKey Findings:\n\n\nThe program requires significant treasury investment through 1439 (deficits of 60,000-90,000 florins annually), but by 1440 with infrastructure complete and industries mature, the deficit shrinks to approximately 40,600 florins. Post-1440, as naval costs stabilize and revenues continue growing, the program should approach break-even.\n\n\nStrongest Performers:\n\n\nNaval/trade expansion (20,000+ florins additional revenue by 1440)\n\nInfrastructure benefits (10,000 florins by 1440)\n\nLeather and silk industries (4,000-4,500 florins each by 1440)\n\n\nWeakest Areas:\n\n\nTextiles — poor quality masters, retry needed\n\nPaper — complete failure, retry needed\n\n\n\"The document includes all one-time investments, annual costs, revenue projections by industry, and outstanding actions for the 1436 review.\"\n\nFile: /mnt/user-data/outputs/Castile_Economic_Development_Plan_1435-1440.docx"

      "say": "Thought process: Excavated reform progress across five initiatives, projected completion timeline.\n\nThe user is asking about Diego de Daza's administrative reforms that were started earlier in the campaign. Let me search for information about these reforms and their current status.\n\nFrom what I've found in the search results, Diego de Daza has been implementing a five-part reform program:\n\n1. Reform #1 (Tax Farming): Hired 200 royal tax collectors, reducing loss from 20-25% to under 15% (40% implemented)\n2. Reform #2 (Crown Land Assessments): Updating assessments, some from 1311 (25% complete)\n3. Reform #3 (Debt Collection): Collected ~600,000 maravedís in \"uncollectable\" debts (20% complete)\n4. Reform #4 (Smuggling Reduction): Better customs enforcement (30% effective)\n5. Reform #5 (Administrative Waste): Reduced royal household expenses (35% implemented)\n\nCombined potential: 3.4 million maravedís annually (~12,800 florins) when fully implemented\nCurrent realization: ~30% = 3,600-4,000 florins in actual gains\n\nThis was the status as of late 1432 (Chapter 40). Now it's summer 1435, so about 2.5-3 years have passed. The reforms should have progressed significantly.\n\nI should have Diego report on the current status of these reforms and estimate when full implementation will be achieved.\n\n\nDiego de Daza enters the council chamber, his ever-present wax tablet and leather folder of documents in hand. He bows and takes his seat when you gesture.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty inquires about the administrative reforms. Yes, they continue.\"\n\n\nHe consults his notes.\n\n\n\"When I last reported comprehensively—November of 1432, if memory serves—we had achieved perhaps thirty percent of potential. Now, nearly three years later...\"\n\n\nHe produces a summary sheet.\n\n\n\nADMINISTRATIVE REFORM PROGRESS — Summer 1435\n\nReform\nNov 1432\nCurrent\nFull Potential\nTax Farming (royal collectors vs. farmers)\n40%\n70%\nReduces loss from 20-25% to under 10%\nCrown Land Assessments\n25%\n55%\nUpdating valuations, some unchanged since 1311\nDebt Collection\n20%\n45%\nRecovering \"uncollectable\" debts\nSmuggling Reduction\n30%\n50%\nBetter customs enforcement\nAdministrative Waste\n35%\n60%\nReduced household expenses\n\nCombined Potential: ~12,800 florins annually when fully implemented\nCurrent Realization: ~55% = approximately 7,000 florins in actual gains above 1432 baseline\n\n\n\nDiego sets down the sheet.\n\n\n\"The work is slow, Your Majesty. Not from lack of effort, but from the nature of the task. Every assessment must be verified. Every debt must be documented and pursued through proper channels. Every customs post must be staffed with honest men—and finding honest men is harder than finding skilled ones.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, weighing his words.\n\n\n\"The Crown Marshals have been invaluable. When a great lord's steward stonewalls my assessors, a Marshal's arrival tends to... clarify matters. But even so, some nobles resist. They delay. They claim ancient privileges. They lose documents.\"\n\n\n\"At the current pace, I estimate two more years—by late 1437—before we reach full implementation. Perhaps sooner if Your Majesty wishes to apply more... direct pressure to certain holdouts.\"\n\n\nHe names no names, but his expression suggests he has a list prepared if asked."

      "say": "Thought process: Identified clarifying questions regarding budget year, reserve allocation, and double-counting prevention.\n\nThe user wants me to update the 1434 finances spreadsheet with:\n1. Expenses from economic measures taken\n2. Naval plan expenses (using exact amounts from the plan, removing the 200,000 reserve)\n3. All existing commitments (like the 5,000 to each Military Order annually)\n4. Diego's reform implementation progress\n5. A separate tab with projections until 1440\n\nLet me think about what questions I might need to ask:\n\n1. The 1434 finances already exist - should I be updating 1434 or creating a 1435 budget? The economic plan shows expenses starting in both 1434 and 1435. The user said \"update our 1434 finances\" but many of the new expenses are 1435 expenses.\n\n2. The Naval reserve of 200,000 was \"set aside\" but not spent. The naval plan shows Year One costs of 68,500. Should the remaining 131,500 stay reserved for future naval expansion, or be released back to available treasury?\n\n3. The 1434 finances show the year ending December 31, 1434. We're now in late summer 1435. Should this be a 1435 budget update?\n\n4. The reform improvements in the 1434 spreadsheet show 30,000 florins. Diego now says we're at 55% of 12,800 = ~7,000 florins. But wait - the 30,000 was already included. I need to clarify if this is cumulative or if the 7,000 is an UPDATE to the 30,000.\n\n5. Some expenses were already included in the 1434 budget (leather 3,000, silk 3,250, fishing 2,700, infrastructure 40,000, etc.) - should I avoid double-counting?\n\n6. The Military Orders grants of 15,000 total (5,000 each) - is this already in the 1434 budget or new?\n\nLet me check what was in the 1434 budget:\n\n\nThe 1434 budget already included several key expenses. The \"New Commitments\" section totaled 61,000, covering infrastructure, Junta, and Military Orders. Additionally, the Economic Development Plan showed initial expenses for leather, fishing, silk, intelligence, and Inquisition totaling 20,450. I'll need to carefully track these to prevent duplicate entries when updating the spreadsheet.\n\nThe new 1435 expenses appear minimal, with arms workshops in Bilbao being the primary addition. I'll need to verify the exact amount and ensure it's not already accounted for in previous budgetary allocations.\n\nPotential clarification points emerge around naval spending, potential gift accounting, and precise year-specific budget tracking. The goal is creating a clean, non-redundant financial record that accurately reflects each year's unique expenditures.\n\n\nDiego nods, pulling out a fresh tablet to note the requirements. After a moment's consideration, he raises several points:\n\n\n\nQuestions from Diego de Daza:\n\n\n1. Year Structure\n\"Your Majesty, the existing spreadsheet covers 1434. We are now in late summer 1435. Should I:\n\n\nUpdate the 1434 figures with what actually occurred, then create 1435 as a new year?\n\nOr combine everything into a single updated document starting from 1435?\"\n\n\n2. Naval Reserve\n\"The 200,000 florin naval reserve was set aside but not yet spent. The Admiral's plan calls for 68,500 florins in Year One. Should the remaining 131,500 florins:\n\n\nReturn to available treasury?\n\nRemain reserved for Years 2-5 of naval expansion?\n\nBe tracked separately as 'committed future naval spending'?\"\n\n\n3. Avoiding Double-Counting\n\"The 1434 budget already includes some economic development expenses—the Junta allocation of 6,000 florins, infrastructure of 40,000, Military Orders grants of 15,000. Should I:\n\n\nTreat these as already spent in 1434, and only add NEW 1435 expenses?\n\nRebuild the entire expense structure from scratch?\"\n\n\n4. Reform Revenue\n\"The 1434 budget shows 30,000 florins under 'Reform Improvements.' My current estimate is ~7,000 florins in gains from administrative reforms. Should I:\n\n\nReplace the 30,000 with my actual figure of 7,000?\n\nOr was the 30,000 from a different source I should preserve?\"\n\n\n5. Projection Assumptions\n\"For the 1435-1440 projections tab, should I assume:\n\n\nAverage outcomes for all industries (as in the Economic Development Plan)?\n\nOr should I note that actual results will be determined by dice rolls each year?\"\n\n\n\n\"Once these are clarified, I can produce an accurate accounting.\""

      "say": "Thought process: Reconciling timeline discrepancies and recalibrating financial allocations.\n\nThe user is clarifying that:\n1. We are still in late summer 1434, not 1435. The timeline confusion was because we played out various measures that would have taken time, but narratively we're still in 1434.\n2. Remove the 200,000 naval reserve - we now have exact figures (68,500 for year one)\n3. Remove the 6,000 Junta reserve - we now have exact figures from the foreign experts\n4. Infrastructure (40,000) and Military Orders grants (15,000) are actual annual expenses going forward\n5. Need to find where the 30,000 \"Reform Improvements\" came from or replace with 7,000 estimate\n6. Use average projections for industries\n\nLet me search for the source of the 30,000 reform improvements figure.\n\n\nTool: Looking for relevant chats in this project...\n\n\nThought process: Traced reform improvements source, reconciled estimates with current progress.\n\nI found the source. The 30,000 \"Reform Improvements\" is broken down as:\n- Council Compliance Improvements: 24,000 (Noble cooperation)\n- Collection Efficiency Gains: 6,000 (Diego's administrative reforms)\n\nSo the 6,000 is Diego's reform gains, and the 24,000 is something called \"Council Compliance Improvements\" related to noble cooperation. This seems to be different from Diego's administrative reforms.\n\nHowever, Diego's current estimate is that his reforms are generating ~7,000 florins at 55% implementation. So the 6,000 was an earlier estimate when reforms were at ~30%.\n\nLet me clarify this with the user or just use what we know. The 24,000 \"Council Compliance Improvements\" seems to be from somewhere else - possibly from the Council of Great Houses or some noble cooperation mechanism.\n\nActually, looking at this more carefully, I should create the updated spreadsheet with:\n1. The 30,000 reform improvements broken down as it was (24,000 + 6,000) but update Diego's portion to 7,000 based on current progress\n2. Or replace the whole thing with just 7,000\n\nThe user said \"use the estimate of what we actually understand; the 7000\" - so I should replace the 30,000 with 7,000.\n\nLet me proceed to create the updated spreadsheet.\n\n\nI found the source. The 30,000 \"Reform Improvements\" was composed of:\n\n\nCouncil Compliance Improvements: 24,000 florins (described as \"Noble cooperation\")\n\nCollection Efficiency Gains: 6,000 florins (Diego's administrative reforms at ~30% implementation)\n\n\nThe 24,000 appears to be an optimistic estimate of increased noble tax compliance that may not have been fully realized. Given the uncertainty, I'll use your guidance and replace the entire 30,000 with the 7,000 florins we can actually document from Diego's reforms at current 55% implementation.\n\n\nI have no further questions. Let me create the updated financial spreadsheet.\n\n\nView: Reading xlsx skill for creating the spreadsheet\n\n\nThought process: Reconciled financial records and consolidated actual expenditures into framework.\n\nNow I understand the requirements. Let me create a comprehensive Python script that will:\n1. Create the updated 1434 finances spreadsheet\n2. Include all the economic development measures\n3. Remove the 200,000 naval reserve (replaced with actual 68,500 spend)\n4. Remove the 6,000 Junta reserve (replaced with actual amounts)\n5. Replace 30,000 reform improvements with 7,000\n6. Include projections for 1435-1440\n\nLet me build this spreadsheet properly.\n\n\nCreate File: Creating Python script to generate the comprehensive 1434 finances spreadsheet with projections\n\n\nThought process\n\nLet me run this script and then use recalc.py to calculate the formulas.\n\n\nBash Tool: Creating the financial spreadsheet\n\n\nThought process\n\nNow I need to recalculate the formulas using the recalc.py script.\n\n\nBash Tool: Recalculating formulas in the spreadsheet\n\n\nThought process\n\nThe recalc script failed.

The figures show:\n\n1434:\n- Opening Treasury: 371,823 florins\n- Total Revenue: 334,094 florins (reduced from 371,594 because we removed the inflated 30,000 reform figure and replaced with 7,000)\n- Total Expenses: 203,680 florins\n- Net Surplus: 130,414 florins\n- Year-End Treasury: 502,237 florins\n\nThis is lower than the previous 545,987 because:\n1. We removed the 23,000 from reform improvements (30,000 → 7,000 = -23,000 revenue)\n2. We added the actual economic development one-time costs\n\nThe projections show healthy growth through 1440, ending with over 1.3 million florins in treasury.\n\nWait - I should check the expenses more carefully. The original spreadsheet showed the naval reserve as 200,000 but not spent. Now we're including the actual naval costs. Let me verify the expense breakdown is correct.\n\nActually looking at the output, the numbers look reasonable. The treasury grows steadily as the economic development programs mature. The 2040 jump is because infrastructure program ends.\n\nLet me present the summary to the player.\n\n\n\nDiego de Daza presents the updated ledger with a mixture of pride and caution.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, the accounts are complete.
