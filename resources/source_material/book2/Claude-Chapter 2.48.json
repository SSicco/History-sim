Queen Lucia sits to your right, her dark hair gathered beneath a simple coif, her grey-green eyes following the columns of figures with the sharp attention she brings to all matters of state.\n\n\nDiego has just finished presenting the quarter's summary—the silver operation at Lanteira yielding forty-three thousand florins in its first six weeks at capacity, with projections climbing toward two hundred thousand by year's end of 1439. Heinrich von Steinberg's request for a second refinery remains before you, along with the question of new coinage that might carry Castilian silver across the known world.\n\n\nThe accounts lie open on the table: treasury holdings approaching eight hundred sixty thousand florins in various forms, though only half exists as coin and bullion.

He has brought a leather satchel stuffed with reports from across the realm—three years' worth of correspondence with masters, guild officials, and Crown agents.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty asks about the economic programs,\" Diego begins, setting out his notes with the methodical precision that has become his hallmark. \"We are now entering the fourth year since the first initiatives were launched in 1434, and the third year for those begun in 1435. Allow me to summarize by industry.\"\n\n\nHe clears his throat.\n\n\n\"Paper mills—Segovia and Toledo both remain operational. Wilhelm Hartmann and Marco da Pescia continue their work. The original projections suggested five thousand florins revenue by this year, with first apprentices contributing. We have ten Castilians who began training in 1435—they should now be approaching journeyman status.\n\n\n\"The wool breeding program—this year marks the first improved wool clip from our crossbred sheep. The lambs born in 1437 from English rams and Castilian ewes are now being sheared for the first time. The question is whether the improvement is measurable.\n\n\n\"Textiles—the Ghent consortium under Gillis de Coninck has been operating for three years. Original projections suggested thirty-five hundred florins revenue by now, with Castilian apprentices beginning to contribute meaningfully.\n\n\n\"Arms and armor—Heinrich Steinmann's workshop in Bilbao should be at five to six hundred soldier's kits per year if the projections held. Four years of operation.\n\n\n\"Glass—Alessandro Barbarigo remains in Burgos. His operation was always the slowest to develop given the secrecy required. Projected fifteen hundred florins revenue by this year.\n\n\n\"The traditional industries—leather in Córdoba, silk in Granada, fishing in Seville—all have had four years to develop from our initial investments.\n\n\n\"And ceramics...\" Diego pauses. \"Ibrahim al-Fakhkhar would now be seventy-seven years old, if he still lives. We have had no word from Málaga in some time.\"\n\n\nHe looks up from his notes.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I can tell you what the projections said. But projections are not reality. Foreign masters grow homesick, fall ill, or quarrel with apprentices. Apprentices prove clumsy or clever beyond expectation. Guilds resist or cooperate. Weather affects wool and leather. Markets shift.\"\n\n\n\nEconomic Development Implementation Roll\n\n\nWhat this roll determines: The overall success of program implementation across all industries from 1435-1438. This is not about individual industries (we'll detail those based on the result) but about whether the ambitious economic development agenda has met, exceeded, or fallen short of projections.\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nStrong initial rolls for most programs in 1435 (papers 88, textiles 87, glass 85, arms 74)\n\nAdequate time elapsed for programs to mature (3-4 years)\n\nStable kingdom with no major disruptions or civil conflicts\n\nDiego de Daza's competent oversight\n\nAdequate funding maintained throughout\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nIbrahim al-Fakhkhar's age and isolation (ceramics knowledge at critical risk)\n\nVenice may have discovered Barbarigo's location\n\nEnglish may have discovered ram smuggling operation\n\nForeign masters subject to homesickness, illness, death\n\nOttoman anxiety now affecting coastal regions (per Chapter 2.47)\n\nSome apprentices inevitably fail or abandon training\n\nNatural disasters, guild politics, market fluctuations\n\n\n\nD100 Economic Development Implementation Table\n\nRoll\nResult\nDescription\n1-5\nCatastrophe\nMultiple disasters. A foreign master has died, been assassinated, or fled. An industry has collapsed entirely. Major diplomatic incident (Venice or England) has exposed Crown operations. Programs running at 40-50% of projections.\n6-15\nSevere Disappointment\nSignificant underperformance. One major program has failed or stalled badly. Foreign master disputes or departures. Apprentice training delays. Programs at 50-60% of projections.\n16-25\nBelow Expectations\nModest shortfalls across multiple programs. No catastrophic failures but persistent problems—quality issues, slow scaling, guild resistance. Programs at 60-75% of projections.\n26-40\nAdequate Progress\nMeeting minimum viable expectations. Some programs ahead, some behind. Normal friction and setbacks balanced by quiet successes. Programs at 75-90% of projections.\n41-60\nSolid Implementation\nPrograms performing as projected. Most apprentices advancing well. Foreign masters productive. Import substitution proceeding on schedule. Programs at 90-110% of projections.\n61-75\nStrong Performance\nExceeding expectations in multiple areas. At least one program significantly ahead of schedule. Knowledge transfer progressing faster than anticipated. Programs at 110-125% of projections.\n76-85\nExcellent Results\nNearly all programs exceeding projections. Apprentices showing exceptional aptitude. Unexpected export opportunities emerging. Programs at 125-140% of projections.\n86-95\nRemarkable Success\nCrown industries thriving beyond expectations. Multiple breakthroughs in quality or efficiency. Castilian expertise developing faster than projected. Programs at 140-160% of projections.\n96-99\nExtraordinary Achievement\nEvery program exceeding projections significantly. Unexpected synergies between industries. Castile becoming known for quality in previously weak sectors. Programs at 160-180% of projections.\n100\nTransformative Triumph\nEconomic development has exceeded all expectations. A second transformative blessing—perhaps a key discovery, an unexpected master arriving, or a breakthrough technique. Programs at 180%+ of projections.\n\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty."

This means:\n\n\"Nearly all programs exceeding projections. Apprentices showing exceptional aptitude. Unexpected export opportunities emerging. Programs at 125-140% of projections.\"\n\nNow I need to detail what this means for each industry, keeping in mind:\n1. The original projections from the economic development documents\n2. The time elapsed (1435-1438, so 3-4 years)\n3. The excellent roll means things are going better than expected\n4. I should create specific, concrete details about each program\n5. I need to address Ibrahim al-Fakhkhar (the ceramics master) specifically since he was a noted concern\n\nLet me go through each industry:\n\n**Paper Mills (1435, Roll 88 original)**\n- Original projection for 1438: 5,000 florins revenue\n- At 125-140%, that's 6,250-7,000 florins\n- 10 apprentices started in 1435, so 3 years of training - they'd be approaching journeyman\n- Excellent result means perhaps some are already contributing, maybe exports have begun\n\n**Wool Breeding (1435, Roll 42 original - adequate)**\n- Timeline said first improved clip in 1438\n- This is the first year we'd see results\n- Excellent overall roll means the breeding program is showing real improvement\n- First crossbred wool now being evaluated\n\n**Textiles - Ghent Consortium (1435, Roll 87 original)**\n- Original projection for 1438: 3,500 florins revenue to masters\n- At 125-140%: 4,375-4,900 florins\n- Apprentices trained for 3 years should be contributing\n- Quality should be improving\n\n**Arms - Steinmann (1434, Roll 74 original)**\n- Original projection for 1438: 500-600 kits/year\n- At 125-140%: 625-840 kits/year\n\n\n- Four years of operation, well-established\n\n**Glass - Barbarigo (1434, Roll 85 original - SECRET)**\n- Venetian glassmaking enterprise shows remarkable progress\n- Projected revenue of 1,500 florins now reaching 1,875-2,100 florins\n- Covert operations maintaining strict secrecy\n- Potential undetected expansion of capabilities\n\n**Traditional Industries:**\n- Córdoba's leather sector demonstrates robust growth\n- Granada's silk production showing promising developments\n- Both industries benefiting from regional expertise and market conditions\n\n**Fishing (Seville)**: Fleet expansion indicates strategic maritime investment\n\n**Ceramics - Ibrahim al-Fakhkhar**:\nAt 76-77, the master craftsman's situation remains complex. Despite a poor initial roll for Málaga's revival, the overall excellent implementation suggests nuanced potential. I'm cautiously optimistic about subtle progress - perhaps preservation of critical techniques or initial steps toward knowledge transfer. The fundamental challenge of apprenticeship persists, but his survival and potential documentation offer a glimmer of hope for preserving this specialized ceramic tradition.\n\n\nDiego de Daza watches as you consider the question, then nods slowly when you indicate he should continue with a full accounting.\n\n\n\"Very well, Your Majesty. Let me go through each program with what I know as of this summer.\"\n\n\nHe consults his papers, organizing them by industry.\n\n\n\nPaper Mills — Segovia & Toledo\n\n\n\"The paper mills have exceeded every expectation,\" Diego begins, and there's a note of genuine satisfaction in his voice. \"Wilhelm Hartmann in Segovia now produces six hundred reams annually—a hundred more than projected. The quality remains consistent, and he has begun experimenting with larger sheets for maps and architectural drawings.\"\n\n\nHe sets down a sheet of paper, crisp and cream-colored, bearing a watermark of the Castilian castle.\n\n\n\"Marco da Pescia in Toledo has done something remarkable. His fine paper has attracted attention beyond our borders. The papal chancery—the papal chancery, Your Majesty—has placed an order for five hundred sheets of his finest stock. They say it rivals anything produced in Italy.\"\n\n\nDiego allows himself a small smile. \"Combined revenue this year will approach seven thousand florins. We projected five thousand.\"\n\n\n\"More importantly, of the ten apprentices who began in 1435, eight have advanced to journeyman status. Two have proven exceptional—one in Segovia, one in Toledo. Hartmann says the Segovian boy, Martín de Ávila, has 'the hands of a born papermaker.' Within two years, we could open a third mill staffed entirely by Castilians trained in both German and Italian methods.\"\n\n\n\nWool Breeding Program — Segovia\n\n\n\"This year marks our first true test,\" Diego continues, his tone more measured. \"The crossbred lambs born in 1437 were sheared this spring. I have here...\"\n\n\nHe produces a small cloth bag and withdraws two samples of raw wool—one darker, coarser; one lighter and noticeably finer.\n\n\n\"The darker is standard Castilian merino. Good wool, as it has always been. The lighter is from our first crossbred generation—English Ryeland rams bred to Castilian ewes.\"\n\n\nHe hands you the samples. The difference is evident even to an untrained hand—the crossbred wool is softer, with a longer staple.\n\n\n\"The Segovia woolmen are... cautiously excited. They say the improvement is measurable but not yet dramatic. Perhaps fifteen to twenty percent finer than baseline merino. The true test comes with the second generation—lambs born this spring from crossbred ewes bred back to English rams. Those sheep will be sheared in 1440.\"\n\n\nDiego pauses. \"We lost three more rams to illness last winter, but fourteen of the original sixteen English bloodlines survive. The breeding master believes we are on pace to match English wool quality by 1445, perhaps sooner if the second generation exceeds expectations.\"\n\n\n\nTextile Workshop — Segovia (Ghent Consortium)\n\n\n\"Gillis de Coninck and his partners have done everything we asked and more,\" Diego reports. \"The workshop now produces finished broadcloths that Flemish merchants mistake for Ghent work—and I mean that literally. A Bruges factor tried to buy their entire stock last year, assuming it was smuggled Flemish goods.\"\n\n\nHe produces a swatch of deep crimson wool cloth, the color rich and even.\n\n\n\"Mathijs Coppens has achieved something with his dyes that even he did not expect. The crimson you see here holds its color through twenty washings. Coppens claims he has improved upon techniques he learned in Ghent by adapting to local mordants. 'Castilian water,' he says, 'is better for reds than Flemish water.' I do not pretend to understand, but the results speak.\"\n\n\n\"Revenue to the masters this year approaches five thousand florins—we projected thirty-five hundred. They have trained fourteen Castilian apprentices, two of whom are nearly ready to establish their own looms. And...\" Diego hesitates, as if uncertain whether to share the next detail.\n\n\n\"The consortium has asked permission to recruit their families from Ghent. Wives, children, aging parents. They wish to make Castile their permanent home. I take this as a sign they see their future here, not as exiles but as founders of something lasting.\"\n\n\n\nArms & Armor Workshop — Bilbao\n\n\n\"Heinrich Steinmann's operation in Bilbao has matured into something formidable,\" Diego says. \"This year they produced six hundred and forty complete soldier's kits—brigandines, sallets, swords, and mail as needed. We projected five to six hundred.\"\n\n\nHe lays out a document showing the production breakdown.\n\n\n\"More significant than the numbers is the quality. Steinmann has begun marking his blades with a distinctive stamp—a mountain peak, for the Basque iron that gives his steel its character. Aragonese knights have begun requesting 'Bilbao steel' by name. Two of King Alfonso's household guard now carry Steinmann blades.\"\n\n\n\"The workshop has trained twelve Castilian apprentices over four years. Three are now skilled enough to work independently on simpler pieces. Steinmann says another five years and we will have native Castilian armorsmiths capable of equipping an army without foreign assistance.\"\n\n\nDiego frowns slightly. \"There is one concern. Steinmann is fifty-seven years old and has begun complaining of stiffness in his hands. He works as hard as ever, but he has asked that we begin searching for a second master—not to replace him, but to ensure continuity. He recommends we look to Nuremberg.\"\n\n\n\nGlass Workshop — Burgos (Secret)\n\n\nDiego lowers his voice, though you are alone in the chamber.\n\n\n\"Alessandro Barbarigo remains in Burgos, and his secret remains intact. Venice has made inquiries—twice in the past two years, Venetian agents have visited Castilian ports asking questions about glassmakers. Both times, our people provided nothing. The workshop's location in Burgos, far from the sea, has proven wise.\"\n\n\n\"Production has grown steadily. This year Barbarigo expects revenue of two thousand florins—we projected fifteen hundred. His cristallo work is extraordinary. I have seen Venetian glass, Your Majesty. Barbarigo's equals it.\"\n\n\nHe produces a small glass goblet, perfectly clear, with a twisted stem that catches the light.\n\n\n\"He has trained four Castilian apprentices. Glassmaking requires longer training than other crafts—the heat, the timing, the breath control. Barbarigo says two of the four show real promise. In eight to ten years, Castile may have native masters of Venetian technique.\"\n\n\n\"There is... one matter.\" Diego hesitates. \"Barbarigo has grown comfortable. Perhaps too comfortable. He has taken a Castilian mistress, a widow in Burgos. He speaks of her children as if they were his own. I mention this because it may affect his willingness to remain hidden. A man building a life may resent living in shadow.\"\n\n\n\nTraditional Industries\n\n\n\"The infrastructure investments of 1434 have borne fruit across the realm,\" Diego continues, moving to a summary sheet.\n\n\n\"Leather in Córdoba: The goat herds have expanded as projected. Sumac plantations are maturing. Córdoban leather now commands premium prices in Barcelona and Valencia. Revenue to the crown through alcabala has increased by roughly three thousand florins annually above the 1434 baseline.\n\n\n\"Silk in Granada: The transition from raw thread export to finished cloth continues. Muslim weavers remain essential—they possess skills our Christian craftsmen cannot yet match. But we have successfully captured the value that previously went to Italian finishers. Revenue increase: approximately thirty-five hundred florins annually.\n\n\n\"Fishing in Seville: The fleet has grown from twelve to twenty-two vessels. Lease payments now total four hundred florins annually. More significantly, the increased fish supply has reduced prices in Seville's markets while increasing alcabala revenue. Total benefit to the crown: perhaps two thousand florins annually, though much of this is indirect.\"\n\n\n\nCeramics — Málaga\n\n\nDiego's expression grows somber.\n\n\n\"And now, Your Majesty, the matter of Ibrahim al-Fakhkhar.\"\n\n\nHe sets down his papers.\n\n\n\"Ibrahim is alive. He is seventy-seven years old, and his hands shake when he is cold, but he is alive. He continues to produce his golden luster ware—perhaps forty pieces per year now, where once he made two hundred.\"\n\n\nDiego pauses.\n\n\n\"Something has changed, though I cannot say precisely what. After your personal letter in 1435, he refused all contact for nearly a year. Then, in the winter of 1437, he sent a message to the Governor of Granada. A single line: 'I will speak with the King's man, if one is sent who understands beauty.'\"\n\n\n\"I sent a young clerk named Tomás de Jerez—a man with some artistic training who studied briefly in Italy. Tomás spent three months in Málaga. Ibrahim would not teach him the technique, but he talked. He spoke of his craft, his philosophy, his despair at the conquest, his grudging respect for a king who would trouble himself with pottery.\"\n\n\nDiego produces a small ceramic tile, perhaps four inches square. Its surface gleams with that impossible golden sheen that has made Málaga ware famous across the Mediterranean.\n\n\n\"Ibrahim gave this to Tomás when he departed. He said: 'Tell your king that beauty does not die with the man who makes it. It dies when no one remembers why it mattered.'\"\n\n\n\"Tomás believes—and I tend to agree—that Ibrahim is testing us. He wants to know if we care about his art for its own sake, or merely for the revenue it generates. He has no heir, no apprentice, no family. His knowledge will die with him unless he chooses to share it.\"\n\n\nDiego meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"This is not a problem that can be solved with florins, Your Majesty. It requires something else. What that something is, I cannot say.\"\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nDiego gathers his papers.\n\n\n\"In total, Your Majesty, our economic development programs are performing at approximately one hundred thirty percent of original projections. Revenue from crown-owned industries—paper mills primarily—now exceeds six thousand florins annually. Revenue increases from subsidized and traditional industries add perhaps another twelve thousand florins through alcabala and customs growth.\"\n\n\n\"We have trained over forty Castilian apprentices across all industries. Some will fail, some will prove merely adequate, but a core of fifteen to twenty show genuine skill. Within five to seven years, Castile will possess native expertise in papermaking, fine textiles, quality arms, and possibly glasswork.\"\n\n\n\"The programs are not merely meeting goals—they are exceeding them. If this pace continues, by 1445 Castile will be a net exporter of quality manufactured goods rather than a net importer.\"\n\n\nHe allows himself a rare moment of pride.\n\n\n\"What Your Majesty planted in 1434 is bearing fruit.\"\n\n\n\nDiego stands, awaiting your response or further questions."

The Kingdom of Sicily (just the island) had a population that was reduced after the Black Death. The combined Kingdom of Sicily (Naples and Sicily) had 4-4.5 million by the mid-late 13th century, but Sicily alone (the island) would be much smaller. By 1803 the island had 1.656 million, and accounting for population growth, in the 1430s it might have had around 500,000-600,000.\n\nNow I need to look at the project knowledge to understand what's happening with Constantinople settlers and other alternate history effects.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Synthesized settlement data and prepared document creation framework.\n\nI found key information about the settlement program. The Roll of 99 for the settlement campaign led to over 5,000 settlers arriving in Constantinople between 1434-1436. The Military Orders estimated ~1,000 families (4,000-5,000 souls) annually from Order lands alone.\n\nConstantinople's current population in the alternate timeline is noted as ~85,000 in a Combined Fleet Assessment from January 1438, up from about 40,000 when Juan first got involved.\n\nLet me now read the SKILL.md file for creating word documents and then create the population document.\n\n\nView: Reading the docx skill to create the population document\n\n\nThought process: Identified prerequisite documentation before proceeding with analysis.\n\nI need to read the docx-js.md file before creating the document.\n\n\nView: Reading the docx-js.md file for document creation syntax\n\n\nThought process: Synthesized historical demographics and projected regional population growth trajectories.\n\nI have all the information I need. Now let me create a comprehensive population document. Based on my research:\n\n**Historical baseline populations (around 1490):**\n- Crown of Castile: 4.3 million\n- Portugal: 1.0 million\n- Catalonia: 0.3 million\n- Valencia: 0.255 million\n- Granada: 0.25 million\n- Aragon: 0.25 million\n- Navarre: 0.12 million\n- Mallorca: 0.05 million\n- Total Iberia: 6.525 million\n\nFor 1438, I need to work backwards. The Black Death killed 60-65% of Iberian population (from 6 million to 2-2.5 million). Recovery was gradual. By the mid-15th century, population was still recovering.\n\nFor 1438 (roughly 50 years before 1490), population would be lower. I'll estimate about 70-75% of 1490 levels for most regions.\n\n**Castile 1438 baseline:**\n- Crown of Castile (without Granada): ~3.0-3.2 million\n- Granada (newly conquered in 1433): ~200,000\n\n**Aragon 1438:**\n- Catalonia: ~250,000\n- Valencia: ~200,000\n- Aragon proper: ~200,000\n- Balearics: ~40,000\n\n**Portugal 1438:** ~800,000\n\n**Navarre 1438:** ~100,000\n\n**Naples 1438:** ~1.0-1.2 million (late 15th century was about 1.5 million)\n\n**Sicily 1438:** ~400,000-500,000\n\n**Constantinople 1438 (alternate history):**\n- Baseline was 40,000-50,000 in the 1430s\n- With settlement program (Roll 99 = 5,000 settlers by 1436), plus additional years\n\n\n- Current estimate from project files: ~85,000 by 1438\n\nThe population data reveals sparse settlements in overseas territories. Portuguese maritime outposts like Ceuta, Madeira, and the Azores had minimal inhabitants. Similarly, the Canary Islands under Castilian control maintained small populations during this period.\n\n\nNow I'll create a comprehensive population document for the realm. Let me compile all the historical data and adjust for our alternate timeline developments.\n\n\nBash Tool: Creating the population census document\n\n\nThought process: Orchestrated demographic analysis and document compilation.\n\nThe document was created successfully.

Now let me summarize the key findings for the user and transition back to the narrative.\n\n\nDiego de Daza accepts the document from his clerk and places it before you.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, the census as you requested. The numbers are... encouraging, though we must acknowledge their imprecision. Tax rolls and ecclesiastical surveys provide our foundation, but many mountain villages and frontier settlements escape accurate counting.\"\n\n\nHe summarizes the key findings:\n\n\n\"The Crown of Castile holds just over three million souls—nearly two-thirds of Iberia. With Granada's new silver drawing settlers, we may see that region double its Christian population within a decade. Constantinople shows the most dramatic transformation: from forty thousand when you took up the title of Defensor to eighty-five thousand today. At current rates, it may reach one hundred fifty thousand by 1445—a third of what it was under Justinian, but enough to defend those walls.\"\n\n\nThe administrator pauses, his expression thoughtful.\n\n\n\"The total population under your direct rule, alliance, or protection approaches six and a half million. By 1443, perhaps six and three-quarters million. For comparison, France holds perhaps fifteen million, though their counts are no more reliable than ours. England, barely three million after their endless wars and plagues. Your realm—if we may call it that—now rivals England and far exceeds any single Italian state.\"\n\n\nHe sets down his notes.\n\n\n\"What orders regarding the economic development programs, Your Majesty? The roll of eighty suggests our industries are performing well—better than projected. Master von Steinberg awaits your decision on the second refinery. The Ghent consortium wishes to bring their families from Flanders. And the question of Ibrahim al-Fakhkhar remains...\"\n\n\n\nThe summer sun slants through the windows of the council chamber. Queen Lucia will be expecting you for the evening meal. The children are somewhere in the gardens—you can hear Catalina's voice carried on the wind, singing something in that pure crystalline tone that made King Duarte call her voice \"given once in a generation.\"\n\nFile: /mnt/user-data/outputs/Population_Census_1438.docx"

This is a substantial task - creating a comprehensive 1438 trade database with full EU5 goods lists for all territories. Let me start by conducting research on historical trade patterns for each region I need to add or update.\n\n\nTool: launch_extended_search_task\n\n\nYour Mediterranean trade research report is ready. It covers commercial networks across the Crown of Aragon, Portugal, Naples, Sicily, and Constantinople during the 1430s-1440s. The report details major exports (textiles, grain, salt, saffron, silk, sugar), key trading ports, population estimates, merchant networks, and the transformative forces—including Portugal's African expeditions and Ottoman expansion—that would reshape European commerce.\n\n\nMediterranean Trade in the 1430s-1440s: A Commercial World in Transition\n\n\n# Mediterranean trade in the 1430s-1440s: A commercial world in transition\n\nThe mid-15th century Mediterranean was an interconnected commercial ecosystem where grain from Sicily fed Italian cities, Aragonese saffron colored Florentine textiles, Portuguese salt preserved Northern European cod, and Genoese merchants controlled the flow of goods from the Black Sea to Flanders. This was a period of profound transition: Portugal's first tentative voyages down the African coast, Alfonso V's conquest reshaping southern Italian commerce, and Constantinople's final decades as a Byzantine capital. **The patterns established in these two decades would shape European trade for centuries.**\n\n---\n\n## Crown of Aragon: The Catalan commercial empire\n\nBarcelona and Valencia served as hubs of a sophisticated trading network stretching from Flanders to Alexandria. By the 1430s-40s, this Crown of Aragon commercial system had evolved from mere redistribution into genuine manufacturing prowess, though the Black Death's demographic devastation still cast long shadows.\n\n### Textile manufacturing drove Aragonese exports\n\nThe wool cloth industry represented the Crown's greatest commercial achievement. Production centers at Lleida, Perpinyà, Puigcerdà, and Barcelona produced **mid-quality woolens** that dominated Mediterranean markets. Valencia's protectionist measures—including a 1342 ban on foreign fabric imports—proved remarkably effective: by the 15th century, local production accounted for **over 90% of textile transactions** in Valencian tax records. Catalan cloth made up **75% of the value** of goods unloaded at Naples during peak trade years (1445-1469).\n\nThe quality ladder remained clear, however. English wool was the finest in medieval Europe, and Barcelona's manufacturers imported it to attempt high-quality production rivaling Flemish cloth. The Crown's textile strength lay in volume and mid-market positioning rather than luxury goods. Supporting industries flourished: kermes dye (scarlet) from southern Valencia, woad from Occitania, and alum for setting colors created an integrated production system.\n\n**Saffron** emerged as another critical export. Grown primarily in inland Aragon's highlands, Aragonese saffron enjoyed exceptional reputation across Europe. Pyrenean customs records from 1445-1448 document substantial flows through the mountain passes at Canfranc and Benasque destined for Constantinople, Sicily, Genoa, and North Africa. The spice commanded high prices as both colorant and culinary ingredient.\n\n### Salt and coral completed the export portfolio\n\nThe **Ibiza salt pans** generated enormous quantities of high-quality sea salt exported throughout the Mediterranean. Catalans carried Ibiza salt to Naples, the Maghreb, and Genoa, while the La Mata salt flats near Guardamar supplemented production. Salt's strategic value extended beyond seasoning—it preserved fish and meat, making it essential to food security across Europe.\n\n**Sardinian coral**, fished and then crafted in Barcelona workshops, became an essential component of Catalan freight headed to the Levant. Eastern Mediterranean markets absorbed large quantities, while Barcelona developed specialized coral-working as a distinctive industry. Iron production, though less documented, supported a thriving weapons manufacturing sector—swords, daggers, crossbows, and armor ranked among Barcelona's \"oldest and most reputed\" exports.\n\n### Agricultural production and chronic grain deficit\n\nValencia's irrigated *huerta* produced rice, dried fruits (figs, raisins, almonds), dates, and wine from Morvedre (Sagunto). These agricultural products rounded out cargo manifests alongside manufactured goods. Yet despite this abundance, **Catalonia experienced a serious grain deficit** from the 13th century onward. Sicily became the primary supplier, with Languedoc and North Africa providing supplementary sources. This structural dependence shaped trade relationships throughout the period.\n\n### Italian networks and Mediterranean reach\n\nThe Catalan *Consolat del Mar* system, established in 1258, positioned consuls across the Mediterranean's major ports. By 1385, Catalan consulates operated throughout Sardinia, Sicily, Naples, North Africa (Tunis, Bugia), Alexandria, Damascus, Cyprus, and Constantinople. Relations with Genoa proved complex—intense commerce punctuated by wars (1331-1336, 1351-1360). In 1386 alone, 13 Catalan cargo ships arrived in Genoa; by 1392-93, the figure reached 33 arrivals and 36 departures.\n\nThe major cities reflected this commercial intensity. **Barcelona**, with approximately **25,000 inhabitants** by the late 15th century (down from 34,000 pre-Black Death), served as the administrative and cultural capital. **Valencia** had become the Crown's largest city, with **8,840 taxed households** by 1489, its unprecedented growth running counter to general demographic decline. **Palma de Mallorca** functioned as a crucial waystation—46.89% of documented journeys from 1448-1480 went to North Africa, making it the primary link to Maghrebi markets.\n\n---\n\n## Kingdom of Portugal: Atlantic horizons opening\n\nThe 1430s-40s represent Portugal's pivot point from a peripheral European kingdom trading Mediterranean commodities to the first European power establishing direct African trade routes. Traditional commerce with England and Flanders continued as the economic backbone, even as Henry the Navigator's expeditions opened extraordinary new possibilities.\n\n### Salt and wine anchored traditional exports\n\nPortuguese salt production centered on **Aveiro** (the primary medieval center) and the growing operations at **Setúbal** in the Sado estuary. By the 12th century, Portuguese salt had achieved international recognition for quality—the combination of abundant sunshine, coastal winds, and shallow tidal areas created ideal evaporation conditions. Salt flowed to Flanders, England, and the Hanseatic League, often exchanged directly for English cloth and codfish.\n\n**Wine exports** benefited from the Treaty of Windsor (1386), which sealed the Anglo-Portuguese alliance and fostered commercial ties. By the second half of the 15th century, substantial Portuguese wine shipments reached England. Production regions included the Minho (vinho verde), Algarve, banks of the Tagus near Lisbon, and the Douro Valley, where flat-bottomed *barcos rabelos* transported wine to Porto. Madeira's first documented wine export to England came in 1456, inaugurating a trade that would flourish for centuries.\n\n### The African trade revolution begins\n\nHenry the Navigator's expeditions during the 1430s-40s transformed Portugal's commercial prospects:\n\n- **1434**: Gil Eanes passed Cape Bojador, breaking a major psychological barrier\n- **1441**: Antão Gonçalves brought the first African captives to Portugal\n- **1443**: Arguin Island reached; Henry granted monopoly on navigation south of Cape Bojador\n- **1444**: Senegal River and Cape Verde reached\n- **1445**: First permanent trading post established on Arguin Island\n\nThe gold trade remained limited during this period—major flows would only develop with Elmina Castle's construction in 1482, eventually yielding an estimated **400 kg annually** by the 1490s. Initial African cargoes contained ivory, gum arabic, wax, malagueta pepper, and enslaved captives. By the 1440s, approximately **800 slaves arrived annually** in Portugal, beginning a trade that would reshape Atlantic history.\n\n### Chronic grain dependence\n\nPortugal faced structural grain deficits, having diversified agricultural land toward more profitable vineyards and olive groves. **Morocco** served as the primary wheat source, especially after the 1415 conquest of Ceuta provided direct access to caravan-borne grain. This dependence drove Portuguese expansion toward grain-producing regions and shaped diplomatic relationships throughout North Africa.\n\n### Major urban centers\n\n**Lisbon** housed approximately **35,000-40,000 inhabitants**, strategically positioned on the Tagus estuary eight miles from the Atlantic. Ships traveling between the Mediterranean and Northern Europe routinely stopped at Lisbon, making it one of Europe's best-informed centers for geographical knowledge. Genoese merchants had maintained a presence since 1317, while Florentine bankers provided capital for maritime ventures. The Jewish community (roughly 10% of population) proved influential in science, finance, and commerce.\n\n**Porto** (estimated **10,000-15,000 inhabitants**) served as a shipbuilding center and wine export hub. Henry the Navigator launched the conquest of Ceuta from Porto in 1415, and the city's maritime traditions supported the Atlantic expansion.\n\n---\n\n## Kingdom of Naples: Grain, saffron, and political transition\n\nThe Kingdom of Naples experienced dramatic political change during this period. **Alfonso V \"the Magnanimous\" captured Naples on June 2, 1442**, ending Angevin rule and integrating the kingdom into the Crown of Aragon's Mediterranean commercial network. This transition brought institutional innovations while leaving fundamental trade patterns largely intact.\n\n### Puglia wheat commanded Mediterranean markets\n\nApulian wheat ranked among **the most strategic commodities in Europe and the Mediterranean**. Francesco Balducci Pegolotti's *Pratica di Mercatura* documented an extensive international distribution network reaching Venice, Florence, Genoa, Barcelona, Constantinople, Alexandria, and even Bruges and London.\n\nThe Adriatic ports of **Manfredonia** (4,892 *carri* annually), **Barletta** (3,354 *carri*), and **Trani** (2,409 *carri*) handled enormous volumes. Export licenses (*tratte*) regulated the trade, with **79% of wheat** passing through the eight main ports destined for export outside the Kingdom. Florentine merchants—particularly the **Medici company, which controlled 33.4% of total wheat exports**—dominated the trade, investing approximately **25,000 florins annually** in grain operations.\n\n### L'Aquila saffron and Calabrian silk\n\n**L'Aquila saffron** (Zafferano dell'Aquila), introduced from Spain in the 13th century by Dominican friars, was considered among the finest in the world. Cultivated on the Navelli Plateau at 800 meters elevation, the saffron required **200,000-250,000 crocus flowers per kilogram** and **500 hours of manual labor**. A unique roasting process over smoldering logs distinguished it from competitors. L'Aquila's position on the *Via degli Abruzzi* (Florence-Naples route) combined saffron exports with wool processing from transhumance flocks.\n\n**Calabrian silk production** centered on Catanzaro, potentially named for Byzantine *Katartarioi* (\"silk spinners\"). At peak periods, Calabrian silk reached **50% of entire Italian/European production**. The technology's value was recognized when Louis XI of France recruited Calabrian masters in 1470 to establish the French silk industry—Giovanni from Catanzaro introduced his loom (*métier de Jean le Calabrais*) to Tours.\n\n### Olive oil and transhumance wool\n\nPuglia's olive groves produced massive quantities of oil, primarily for illumination (\"lampante\" oil) rather than culinary use. Between the 15th-16th centuries, **8.7 million liters annually** flowed to Venice alone via specialized ships called *marciliane*.\n\nAlfonso V institutionalized the ancient transhumance system in 1447 with the **Regia Dogana della Mena delle Pecore di Puglia**. Sheep traveled from Abruzzo mountains to the Tavoliere Plain via ancient grass paths (*tratturi*) up to **110 meters wide**. The Tratturo Magno stretched **244 kilometers** from L'Aquila to Foggia. Alfonso introduced Spanish Merino rams for crossbreeding, though Neapolitan wool never matched Spanish, Flemish, or English quality.\n\n### Naples as urban center\n\n**Naples was the largest city in Italy** during the Renaissance, reaching approximately 210,000 inhabitants by 1550, while no other kingdom city exceeded 20,000. Florentine, Venetian, and Genoese merchants maintained significant presences, with provincial economies tied to these foreign trade networks. The Medici structured their operations through the Trani consulate and extensive networks of Dalmatian/Ragusan shipowners—61 individual shipowners were identified working for Medici alone in 1486-1487.\n\n---\n\n## Kingdom of Sicily: Mediterranean breadbasket and sugar producer\n\nSicily under Aragonese rule functioned as an agricultural powerhouse, with grain exports dominating commerce. The island's volcanic soils and favorable climate made it one of the most prolific wheat producers in the Mediterranean, while sugar production reached its pre-Atlantic peak.\n\n### Grain exports through the tratte system\n\nKnown as the \"breadbasket of Rome\" since antiquity, Sicily's durum wheat supplied Italian cities, Barcelona, and Eastern Mediterranean markets. The **tratte** licensing system regulated exports: merchants purchased licenses from the state, the *Maestro Portolano* administered the trade, and leading merchants obtained positions supporting crown revenue goals.\n\nOver **50 ancient grain varieties** were cultivated, including Tumminia (short growing season, March-June) and the quick-growing Marzullo used during wartime. Grain flowed through **Palermo** (the central hub for negotiations), **Messina**, **Trapani**, **Agrigento**, and **Syracuse**. Genoese merchants dominated long-distance trade, setting up companies to purchase tratte and share profits.\n\n### Sugar production at its Mediterranean peak\n\nSugar cane, introduced by Arab conquerors in the 9th-10th centuries, made Sicily **one of the most important sugar production centers** in the western Mediterranean by the early 15th century. Production concentrated in the Palermo hinterland, transformed into industrial territory with water-powered crushing mills and refining facilities.\n\n**Pisan businessmen** provided crucial financing and trade infrastructure. Exports reached the Maghreb, Egypt, Flanders, England, Venice, and Barcelona. The French merchant **Jacques Coeur** was active in Sicilian sugar trade during the 1440s. Competition came from Cyprus (known for best quality), Crete, Rhodes, Morocco, and Valencia. However, **Madeira's first refining in 1432** signaled the beginning of Atlantic island competition that would eventually eclipse Mediterranean production.\n\n### Trapani's industrial complex\n\n**Trapani** emerged as a remarkable multi-industry center combining salt, coral, and tuna production. The salt pans, established by Phoenicians, operated continuously through the medieval period. Frederick II established a state monopoly promoting Mediterranean and European trade; by the Spanish era, Trapani became the largest Mediterranean salt port.\n\n**Coral fishing** off San Vito Lo Capo and the Egadi Archipelago produced raw material for jewelry and religious objects. Late 14th-century documents show coral as **Trapani's largest export** alongside salt and tuna.\n\nThe **tonnare** (fixed-trap net systems for bluefin tuna) operated from Byzantine origins, perfected by Arabs around 1000 CE. Migrating tuna were caught from May-August, then preserved using Trapani salt—salted fillets, bottarga (cured roe), and ventresca (belly cuts) were shipped throughout the Mediterranean.\n\n### Sicilian silk production\n\nSilk craft, introduced by Arab conquerors and enhanced by Norman King Roger II's 1147 capture of Byzantine artisans, continued in Palermo, Messina, Catania, Agrigento, and Trapani during this period. However, the industry had declined from its Norman-era heights, and northern Italian production (Lucca, Venice, Florence) had achieved superiority. **Messina** would later process over **400,000 pounds of silk annually** by the early 17th century.\n\n### Urban populations and character\n\n**Palermo** housed approximately **22,000-30,000 inhabitants** in the 1430s-40s, having declined from 40-50,000 in the 13th century due to the Black Death and wars. The city functioned as royal seat, center of wheat trade negotiations, and home to diverse merchant communities (Genoese, Tuscans, Catalans). **Messina's** strategic position on the Straits made it the gateway between Tyrrhenian and Ionian seas, crucial for eastern Mediterranean trade.\n\n---\n\n## Constantinople and Byzantine trade: Final decades of an empire\n\nBy the 1430s, the Byzantine Empire had contracted to Constantinople itself, the Princes' Islands, and the Peloponnese. The population had collapsed from approximately **400,000 in the 12th century** to perhaps **40,000-70,000**—some scholars estimate as low as 25,000 by 1453. The 1430 Ottoman conquest of Thessaloniki stripped away a major commercial center. Constantinople remained strategically vital, controlling the Bosphorus, but economically it had become dependent on Italian merchant powers.\n\n### Black Sea grain under Genoese control\n\nThe **Genoese dominated Black Sea grain trade** after the 1352 Byzantine-Genoese treaty granted unrestricted export rights. **Caffa** (modern Feodosia) served as the principal hub, with **Tana** (Don River terminus) and Danube ports (Kiliya, Licostomo) completing the network. Crimean wheat was highest quality, with the \"bushel of Caffa\" (281.51 kg) serving as the standard measure.\n\nTrade volumes were substantial: in 1360, within 2.5 months, **10,200 bushels (2,522.5 tonnes)** of grain were exported from Kiliya alone. By 1384, Caffa supplied Genoa with 31,344 minas, representing **36% of total Genoese grain imports**. However, Ottoman pressure on the Bosphorus and Dardanelles made export increasingly difficult, while poor harvests in the 1450s left Crimean production insufficient for local needs.\n\n### Alum: Essential for European textiles\n\n**Phocaea**, granted to Genoese brothers in 1267, produced approximately **700 tonnes of refined alum annually** by the 1330s, generating profits of 50,000 Genoese lire. Alum was the **essential mordant** for textile dyeing—without it, Western European wool industries could not produce colorfast fabrics. Phocaea remained the dominant source until Ottoman conquest in 1455 and the 1462 discovery of Tolfa deposits in papal territories.\n\nAnnual exports reached approximately **665.7 tonnes** in the early 14th century, destined for Flanders, England, France, and Italian states. Processing required heating stones to 900°F for 18 hours, then weathering for four months—a Genoese-controlled technical monopoly.\n\n### Russian furs and Black Sea trade goods\n\nThe **fur trade** flowed from Russian lands and Siberia through Tana and Caffa to Western markets. Sable (most precious), ermine, squirrel, marten, beaver, and fox generated extraordinary profits—sometimes reaching **100%**. In 1388, approximately **70,000-80,000 pieces of fur** were exported from Caffa to Genoa. Wax and honey from the Crimea, Don region, and Danube supplemented fur cargoes, with profit margins around 35%.\n\n**Fish and caviar** from Black Sea sturgeon reached wholesale scale. Late 13th-century records document estimated exports of **31,492-31,793 tonnes of fish**—sturgeon weighing 16.75-19.7 kg on average—destined for Constantinople/Pera, Trebizond, and beyond. Caviar reached as far as Bruges, commanding higher prices than silk.\n\n### Galata's virtual autonomy\n\n**Galata** (Pera), the Genoese colony on the Golden Horn's northern shore, functioned as a **virtually autonomous** trading center by the 1430s. Surrounded by fortified walls and governed by a *podestà* and 24-member council, Galata controlled the Black Sea trade network. Spanish traveler Pero Tafur noted in the 1430s that Genoa was \"a nation very powerful at sea.\" Genoese trade income may have exceeded Constantinople's own revenues.\n\nThe **Venetian quarter** on the southern shore maintained presence through their *bailo* administration, trading in Black Sea regions despite ongoing tensions with Genoa. Both Italian maritime powers had effectively taken control of Byzantine foreign trade through accumulated privileges and superior naval capacity—Byzantine merchants were marginalized in their own capital.\n\n### Constantinople's diminished economy\n\nThe city's economy had contracted to roughly **40% of 1200 levels**, with annual revenues plummeting from approximately 3 million nomismata to **under 1 million**. Large areas within the Theodosian walls lay abandoned or converted to gardens and monastic estates. The once-famed Byzantine silk industry operated at reduced scale; imperial workshops continued but with diminished output. Mystras in the Morea had become the empire's cultural center, while Constantinople relied on imported grain and manufactured goods for survival.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion: A Mediterranean at crossroads\n\nThe trade patterns of the 1430s-1440s reveal a Mediterranean economy of remarkable integration and specialization. Sicilian and Puglian grain fed deficit regions from Barcelona to Constantinople. Aragonese saffron and Calabrian silk colored and adorned European elites. Portuguese salt preserved the fish that fed Catholic Europe through Lent. Genoese and Venetian merchants knit these exchanges together through networks of consulates, colonies, and credit.\n\nYet beneath this apparent stability, transformative forces were gathering. Portugal's African expeditions would eventually redirect spice and gold flows from Mediterranean to Atlantic routes. The Ottoman advance would soon close the Black Sea to Italian commerce entirely—Constantinople would fall in 1453, Caffa in 1475. Atlantic island sugar from Madeira and the Canaries would undercut Mediterranean producers. The commercial world of the 1430s-40s, for all its sophistication, stood at the edge of fundamental restructuring that would reshape global trade for the modern era."

Specifically, I'll eliminate New World and Asian goods that weren't yet known in Europe. This means removing Chili, Cocoa, Coffee, Cotton, Maize, Potatoes, Tea, and Tobacco from the inventory. I'll also adjust the categories to align more closely with medieval trade terminology, using broader classifications like \"Grain\" and \"Fish\" that reflect the trading practices of the time.\n\nMy approach involves carefully reconstructing the market database with period-appropriate goods, ensuring historical authenticity while maintaining a comprehensive trading framework.

Since we count women and children who do not work, meaning that this skews this number a bit. But still. If the average yearly income of an average worker is 12 florins, than there is still a lot more economic activity that is not reflected in the trade goods produced.

      "say": "Thought process: Validated economic reasoning about hidden subsistence and local production.\n\nThe user is making an astute observation about the relationship between population, trade goods production, and total economic activity. Let me think through this carefully.\n\nTheir observation:\n1. ~6 million population produces ~6.8 million florins of trade goods = roughly 1 florin per person\n2. Average worker income is ~12 florins/year\n3. This means trade goods only represent a fraction of total economic activity\n4. The difference is explained by non-tradeable economic activity: local services, construction, baking, etc.\n\nThis is absolutely correct economic reasoning. The trade database captures:\n- Goods that enter inter-regional or international trade\n- Primary commodities (wool, grain, iron, etc.)\n- Manufactured goods that are traded (cloth, weapons, paper)\n\nWhat it DOESN'T capture:\n- Local services (barbers, doctors, lawyers, notaries)\n- Construction (carpenters, masons, thatchers building local houses)\n- Local food processing (bakers, butchers, millers)\n- Domestic servants\n- Local crafts that don't leave the village/town\n- Agricultural labor that produces subsistence food (not traded)\n- Church services, education\n- Transportation and logistics labor\n- Mining labor beyond the ore value\n- Military/guard services\n\nIn a medieval economy, subsistence agriculture is HUGE. Most peasants grow food primarily for their own consumption, with only surplus entering trade. The grain numbers in the database represent traded grain, not total grain production.\n\nLet me think about the math:\n- Population: 6 million\n- Working population: Maybe 40-50% (excluding young children, elderly, sick)\n- So ~2.5-3 million workers\n- If average income is 12 florins/year, that's 30-36 million florins of total economic activity\n- Trade goods represent 6.8 million florins = roughly 19-23% of total economy\n\nThis ratio actually makes sense for a medieval economy where:\n- Most production is subsistence agriculture\n\n\n- Most services are local\n- Long-distance trade is a small (but crucial) slice of the economy\n- Most people never travel more than 20 miles from their birthplace\n\nI recognize the trade database as a strategic tool that captures the economically significant transactions. It reveals the visible economic layer that matters to rulers - tracking inter-regional commerce, potential tax revenues, and strategic resource movements. Meanwhile, the underlying local economy continues its essential daily functioning, largely invisible but critically important to societal survival.\n\n\nYou're making an excellent observation about medieval economic structure. Your reasoning is sound.\n\n\nThe Math:\n\n\n~6 million population in tracked markets\n\n~6.8 million florins in trade goods production\n\n≈ 1.1 florins per capita in tradeable goods\n\n\nBut if the average worker earns ~12 florins/year, and perhaps 40-45% of the population works (excluding young children, elderly, infirm), that suggests:\n\n\n~2.5-2.7 million workers\n\n~30-32 million florins of total economic activity annually\n\nTrade goods represent only ~20-22% of total economic output\n\n\nThis is historically accurate for a medieval economy. The trade database captures what enters inter-regional or international commerce—the visible economy that generates customs duties, almojarifazgo, and merchant profits.\n\n\nWhat the database misses:\n\nCategory\nExamples\nSubsistence agriculture\nPeasants growing food they eat themselves—never enters trade\nLocal services\nBarbers, physicians, notaries, innkeepers, prostitutes\nConstruction labor\nCarpenters, thatchers, masons building houses, barns, walls\nLocal food processing\nMillers, bakers, butchers serving their village\nDomestic service\nServants, cooks, stable hands in noble households\nTransport labor\nMuleteers, carters, porters—their labor moves goods but isn't a \"good\"\nClergy services\nMasses, sacraments, education\nMilitary/guard service\nSoldiers, watchmen, castle garrisons\n\nThe overwhelming majority of medieval economic activity was local and non-tradeable. A peasant in León might live his entire life within 20 miles of his birthplace, producing grain his family eats, paying rent to his lord, buying bread from the village baker, and never touching a \"trade good\" except perhaps salt and iron tools.\n\n\nFor royal administration purposes, the trade database captures what matters for:\n\n\nCustoms revenue (almojarifazgo, portazgo)\n\nStrategic commodities (wool, iron, grain, weapons)\n\nInternational balance of payments\n\nMerchant wealth that can be taxed\n\n\nThe \"invisible\" local economy sustains daily life but doesn't generate the Crown revenue streams you're tracking in your financial spreadsheets. Does this align with how you've been thinking about the Castilian economy?"

It dies when no one remembers why it mattered.\"\n\n\nOptions for Further Development\n\n\n1. ADDRESS IMMEDIATE SUCCESSION RISKS\n\n\nSteinmann Succession (Bilbao Arms)\n\n\nSend to Nuremberg for a second master armorer\n\nCost: ~3,000-4,000 florins recruitment + relocation\n\nSteinmann's recommendation: Someone from his network who shares his \"weapons for soldiers\" philosophy\n\nThis is urgent - if Steinmann's hands fail before knowledge transfers, we lose momentum\n\n\nIbrahim al-Fakhkhar (Málaga Ceramics)\n\n\nDiego says: \"This is not a problem that can be solved with florins\"\n\nIbrahim is testing whether the Crown cares about art for its own sake\n\nOptions:\nSend someone who understands beauty - an artist, a poet, someone who can speak to craft\n\nRecover his grandson Yusef from Fez - dangerous but might change everything\n\nAccept the loss and focus on Manises (Valencia) lusterware instead\n\nRoyal visit - Juan himself going to Málaga to speak with Ibrahim\n\n\n2. EXPAND SUCCESSFUL INDUSTRIES\n\n\nPaper (Third Mill)\n\n\nMartín de Ávila ready to lead an all-Castilian workshop\n\nCost: ~4,000-5,000 florins\n\nCould specialize in a third type (perhaps maps/charts for navigation?)\n\nTimeline: 2 years to full production\n\n\nTextiles (Ghent Consortium Expansion)\n\n\nConsortium wants to bring families permanently\n\nCould expand to second workshop\n\nCost: ~5,000-6,000 florins for additional looms/facility\n\nGranting hidalgía and family immigration would cement their loyalty\n\n\nBilbao Steel (Export Capacity)\n\n\n\"Bilbao steel\" has a reputation now\n\nCould expand beyond military kits to civilian tools, shipbuilding hardware\n\nCost: ~4,000 florins for additional forge capacity\n\n\n3. NEW INDUSTRIES TO CONSIDER\n\n\nShipbuilding Expansion\n\n\nCurrent: Bilbao, Santander, Seville yards\n\nPortugal dominates Atlantic shipbuilding\n\nCould recruit Portuguese or Genoese master shipwrights\n\nCost: 8,000-12,000 florins for master recruitment + yard expansion\n\n\nPrinting\n\n\nGutenberg's press (1440s in historical timeline) is coming\n\nGerman contacts might locate early printing expertise\n\nWould complement paper industry\n\nPerhaps premature in 1438, but worth monitoring\n\n\nMining Engineering (Granada Silver)\n\n\nSilver discovery requires sophisticated extraction\n\nGerman mining engineers (Saxony, Tyrol) lead Europe\n\nCould dramatically increase silver yields\n\nCost: 5,000-8,000 florins for master miners + equipment\n\n\nGunpowder/Cannon Founding\n\n\nCurrently importing much of this\n\nCould establish foundry at Seville or Toledo\n\nRequires bronze-casting expertise + saltpeter supply\n\nCost: 10,000-15,000 florins for proper establishment\n\n\n4. RESOLVE THE BARBARIGO SITUATION\n\n\nAlessandro Barbarigo has been in Burgos for nearly 4 years now. He's building a life, perhaps a new family. The secrecy cannot last forever.\n\n\nOptions:\n\n\nAcknowledge him publicly - Accept Venetian protest as inevitable, offer him formal royal protection\n\nMaintain secrecy - Continue as-is, but tension will grow\n\nNegotiate with Venice - Unlikely to succeed, but could try to legitimize his status\n\nMove him further - Constantinople? Out of Italian reach entirely\n\n\n\nQuestions for You, Your Majesty:\n\n\nSteinmann succession - Do you wish to authorize recruitment of a second Nuremberg master?\n\nIbrahim al-Fakhkhar - This requires a personal decision. Do you send someone who can speak to craft and beauty? Attempt to recover his grandson? Visit yourself? Or accept the likely loss?\n\nGhent Consortium families - Shall we permit them to bring families and offer permanent settlement?\n\nNew industries - Which, if any, do you wish to pursue? Mining engineering for the Granada silver seems most immediately valuable.\n\nBarbarigo - The glass workshop cannot remain secret forever. What is your will?"

In Chapter 2.40, there was an artillery review with Pietro Calabrese:\n\n- Current inventory: 40 serviceable cannon\n- Production rate: 8-10 cannon/year (up from 3/year during Granada)\n- Crisis identified: Navy needs 30 guns/year, foundry produces only 10\n- Ships carry half complement with wooden decoys painted as cannon\n- Foundry Expansion Approved:\n  - One-time investment: 6,000 florins (second furnace, recruitment)\n  - Annual costs from 1437: 17,000 florins total artillery budget\n  - Timeline: 3 years to full fleet armament (by spring 1439)\n  - Chaos Roll: 23 — Some challenges expected in expansion\n\nSo the foundry expansion was already approved in Spring 1436. Now it's Summer 1438. Let me calculate where they should be in the expansion timeline. They should be about 2 years into the 3-year expansion, so by Spring 1439 they should have full fleet armament.\n\nGiven the economic development roll of 80 (excellent, 125-140% of projections), the foundry should be doing well. But the chaos roll was 23, which suggests \"some challenges.\"\n\nLet me now provide a comprehensive response addressing all the user's points.\n\n\nExcellent. I found the information on the cannon foundry. Let me provide Diego's comprehensive report on all these initiatives.\n\n\n\nDiego de Daza's Report - Summer 1438\n\n\nDiego bows as he enters the king's study, a sheaf of documents under his arm.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty has given me much to work with. Let me address each matter.\"\n\n\n\n1. STEINMANN SUCCESSION - NUREMBERG RECRUITMENT\n\n\n\"I shall dispatch a letter to Heinrich Steinmann immediately, asking him to identify the best candidate from his network. A man who shares his philosophy—weapons for soldiers—and who can eventually lead the Bilbao operation.\"\n\n\nEstimated Costs:\n\n\nRecruitment and relocation: 3,500-4,500 florins\n\nHousing in Bilbao: 800-1,000 florins\n\nInitial retainer: 1,200 florins/year\n\n\n\"Steinmann knows the German armorers' world. His recommendation will carry weight. I suggest we offer terms generous enough that we attract a true master, not a journeyman seeking easy coin.\"\n\n\nTimeline: If dispatched this autumn, we might have someone by Spring 1439.\n\n\n\n2. IBRAHIM AL-FAKHKHAR\n\n\n\"Your Majesty will think on this. I would only note that he sent a message recently. He said: 'Tell your king that beauty does not die with the man who makes it. It dies when no one remembers why it mattered.'\"\n\n\nDiego pauses. \"I am a man of ledgers, Your Majesty. I do not pretend to understand what he means. But I suspect he is waiting for something—or someone—who does.\"\n\n\n\n3. TEXTILE INDUSTRY EXPANSION - GRAND INVESTMENT\n\n\nDiego's eyes light up. \"Now this I understand, Your Majesty. The Ghent consortium is eager. Gillis de Coninck has been hinting for months that if we expand, they can do more. And with the wool breeding program showing results—15-20% finer clip this spring—we will soon have raw material that rivals English wool.\"\n\n\nProposed Expansion Plan:\n\nComponent\nCost\nNotes\nSecond workshop complex (Segovia)\n6,000 fl\nAdjacent to existing, shared infrastructure\nAdditional 100 looms\n4,500 fl\nEnough to process dramatically increased output\nFamily relocation (12 families)\n2,400 fl\nPermanent settlement, schools for children\nTraining facility\n2,000 fl\nFormal apprenticeship program\nDyeing expansion\n1,500 fl\nMore vats, mordants—Coppens's crimson technique\nWarehouse for wool storage\n1,200 fl\nClimate-controlled for quality preservation\nTOTAL ONE-TIME\n17,600 fl\n\nAnnual Costs (New):\n\n\nAdditional wages/retainers: 2,500 fl/year\n\nMaterials and maintenance: 1,500 fl/year\n\n\nStrategic Vision: \"By 1445, when our breeding program produces wool equal to English quality, we should have the capacity to weave all of it domestically. No more exporting raw wool to Flanders and buying back cloth at triple the price. Castile becomes a cloth exporter.\"\n\n\nHidalgía and Settlement: \"I recommend we formally grant the consortium members hidalgía now—they have served five years with exceptional results. This cements their loyalty and makes them Castilian. Their children will be Castilian subjects, trained in Flemish techniques.\"\n\n\n\n4. NAVAL SUPPLIES INDUSTRY\n\n\n\"Your Majesty is correct that we need the supplies, not more yards. Our shipbuilding program strains existing capacity for rope, tar, sailcloth, and timber.\"\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\n\nRope: Produced in Galicia (hemp) and Basque country, but insufficient for fleet expansion\n\nTar: Imported from Baltic (expensive) or produced in small quantities in Asturias\n\nSailcloth: Limited production, imports from Flanders and Genoa\n\nTimber: Cantabrian forests adequate but transport is the bottleneck\n\n\nProposed Naval Stores Development:\n\nInitiative\nInvestment\nAnnual Cost\nNotes\nRope-walk expansion (Galicia)\n3,000 fl\n800 fl\nDouble current capacity, hemp cultivation incentives\nTar kilns (Asturias)\n2,500 fl\n600 fl\nPine forests, reduce Baltic imports\nSailcloth workshop (Bilbao)\n4,000 fl\n1,000 fl\nNear existing flax/hemp sources\nTimber roads (Cantabria)\n5,000 fl\n—\nIntegrate with infrastructure program\nTOTAL\n14,500 fl\n2,400 fl/year\n\n\"These are not glamorous investments, but they ensure our fleet can be maintained without foreign dependence.\"\n\n\n\n5. PRINTING PRESS - A NEW FRONTIER\n\n\nDiego hesitates. \"Your Majesty speaks of something few have seen. I have heard rumors from German merchants—a man named Gutenberg in Mainz has developed a method to cast metal letters and press them onto paper, producing books faster than any scriptorium.\"\n\n\n\"This is... revolutionary, if true. And it pairs perfectly with our paper mills.\"\n\n\nThe Challenge: \"This is not like recruiting an armorer or glassblower. This technology is new—perhaps only a handful of men in all Christendom understand it. And they are in Germany, where the technique was born.\"\n\n\nProposed Approach:\n\n\nIntelligence gathering (1438-1439): Send agents to Mainz, Strasbourg, and other German cities to learn who knows this craft\n\nEstablish contacts via our existing German network (the same that found Steinmann and our papermakers)\n\nGenerous terms: This is rare knowledge—we must offer exceptional inducements\n\nSite preparation: Prepare a workshop in Toledo, near the fine paper mill\n\n\nEstimated Investment:\n\n\nIntelligence and recruitment: 2,000-3,000 florins\n\nWorkshop establishment: 5,000-7,000 florins\n\nMaster's terms: Unknown—this is uncharted territory\n\n\n\"I recommend we authorize an initial 3,000 florins for recruitment efforts, with the understanding that if we find a true master, we will invest whatever is necessary. Your Majesty's vision of Castile as a center of innovation depends on seizing such opportunities before others.\"\n\n\nTimeline: This may take 2-3 years. The knowledge is closely held.\n\n\n\n6. GRANADA SILVER MINING ENGINEERS\n\n\n\"This investment, as Your Majesty says, pays for itself many times over.\"\n\n\nDiego produces a ledger. \"Our current silver extraction is... adequate. But German miners—particularly from Saxony and the Tyrol—have developed techniques for deeper shafts, better drainage, and more efficient ore processing. The Fuggers of Augsburg have grown wealthy financing such operations.\"\n\n\nProposed Investment:\n\nComponent\nCost\nNotes\nRecruitment of Saxon mining engineers (2-3)\n4,000 fl\nVia Augsburg contacts\nEquipment purchase\n3,000 fl\nPumps, winches, specialized tools\nHousing and workshop\n1,500 fl\nNear Sierra Nevada operations\nTOTAL ONE-TIME\n8,500 fl\n\nAnnual Costs:\n\n\nEngineer retainers: 2,000 fl/year (declining as Castilians learn)\n\nEquipment maintenance: 500 fl/year\n\n\nPotential Return: \"If German techniques increase yield by even 20%, that is an additional 50,000+ florins annually from the silver operations alone. This is perhaps the single best investment we can make.\"\n\n\n\n7. CANNON FOUNDRY STATUS (SEVILLE)\n\n\nDiego consults his notes. \"Your Majesty approved the foundry expansion in Spring 1436. Master Pietro Calabrese received 6,000 florins for a second furnace and additional workers.\"\n\n\nCurrent Status (Summer 1438):\n\n\n\"The chaos roll of 23 has manifested in... challenges.\"\n\nMetric\n1436 (Pre-Expansion)\n1438 (Current)\nTarget (1439)\nProduction rate\n8-10 guns/year\n18-22 guns/year\n30 guns/year\nSkilled workers\n12\n24\n35\nFurnaces\n1\n2 (1 temperamental)\n2 (fully operational)\n\nProblems Encountered:\n\n\nSecond furnace has inconsistent heat—castings sometimes crack during cooling\n\nBronze supply occasionally disrupted (Venetian sources... complicated)\n\nTwo promising apprentices poached by Aragonese foundries\n\n\nPietro Calabrese's Assessment: \"We are producing twice what we did, but still below target. The furnace problem is solvable—I need a master founder from Italy who understands these temperamental beasts. The bronze supply... that requires diplomatic solutions, not technical ones.\"\n\n\nRecommended Additional Investment:\n\nItem\nCost\nNotes\nMaster founder recruitment (Italy)\n2,500 fl\nFix furnace problems\nSecure alternative bronze source\n3,000 fl\nEnglish tin + Basque copper = domestic bronze\nApprentice retention bonuses\n500 fl/year\nKeep trained workers\nTOTAL\n6,000 fl one-time\n500 fl/year\n\n\"With this investment, we should reach 30 guns/year by late 1439—full fleet armament by 1440.\"\n\n\n\n8. ALESSANDRO BARBARIGO - END OF SECRECY\n\n\nDiego nods slowly. \"Your Majesty's decision is wise. The secrecy has served its purpose—Barbarigo has trained four Castilian apprentices, two of whom now produce credible cristallo. The knowledge has taken root.\"\n\n\nProposed Approach:\n\n\nFormal royal protection: Issue a charter declaring Alessandro Barbarigo under the Crown's protection as a valued artisan. Any harm to him is an offense against the Crown of Castile.\n\nSecurity measures:\n\n\nMove him to a house within Burgos's walls (not outside)\n\nAssign two permanent guards (not obvious, but present)\n\nHis workshop becomes officially recognized—no more hiding\n\nDiplomatic gesture to Venice:\n\n\nSend a gift of Castilian goods (Toledo blades, Córdoba leather, Granada silk) worth ~500-800 florins\n\nAccompany with a letter expressing Castile's respect for Venice's commercial achievements\n\nDo not apologize or acknowledge wrongdoing—we offered sanctuary to a free man\n\nMake clear that Barbarigo's skills now serve Castile, that attempting to harm him would be... unwise\n\n\n\"The Venetians will be furious, but they are pragmatic. They will calculate whether assassination attempts in distant Castile are worth the diplomatic cost, especially when the damage is already done. They will conclude it is not.\"\n\n\nBarbarigo himself: \"I believe he will be relieved. The secrecy has weighed on him. He has built a life in Burgos—a new wife, I am told, a Castilian widow. He wants to live openly, not in shadows.\"\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF PROPOSED INVESTMENTS\n\nInitiative\nOne-Time\nAnnual\nPriority\nSteinmann succession (Nuremberg master)\n5,300 fl\n1,200 fl\nHIGH\nTextile expansion (Ghent consortium)\n17,600 fl\n4,000 fl\nHIGH\nNaval supplies development\n14,500 fl\n2,400 fl\nHIGH\nPrinting press recruitment\n3,000 fl\nTBD\nMEDIUM\nGranada mining engineers\n8,500 fl\n2,500 fl\nHIGH\nCannon foundry fix\n6,000 fl\n500 fl\nHIGH\nBarbarigo protection + Venice gift\n1,500 fl\n200 fl\nIMMEDIATE\nTOTAL\n56,400 fl\n10,800 fl/year\n\nDiego sets down his papers. \"Your Majesty's treasury can bear this.

They want to watch their children play and then have a private conversation with Catalina, their eldest daughter.\n\nLet me recall what I know about the children from the project files:\n- Catalina (born ~1432, so about 6 years old in 1438) - daughter from first marriage to Isabel of Portugal\n- Fernando (born ~1433, so about 5 years old) - son from first marriage to Isabel of Portugal\n- Bianca (born ~1434) - daughter from second marriage to Lucia d'Este\n- Teresa (born ~1435) - daughter from second marriage to Lucia d'Este\n- Juana (born later) - daughter from second marriage\n- Nicolás (born later) - son from second marriage\n\nFrom Chapter 2.40, I remember Catalina had a \"legendary performance\" at the Cortes - described as brilliant, commanding, but \"spiritually empty.\" She was 4 at that time (Spring 1436). Now it's Summer 1438, so she would be about 6.\n\nLet me check the Royal Children Database for more details on their personalities.\n\nFrom the summaries I've seen:\n- Catalina: Brilliant, commanding, but something concerning about her - \"spiritually empty\" was mentioned\n- Fernando: Gentle, brilliant, sincere faith, scholarly soul despite looking like a warrior-king\n\nI should set a scene of Juan watching his children play, then having him call Catalina aside. I need to stop when Juan is about to speak to her, waiting for the player to indicate what he wants to discuss.\n\nLet me write a warm domestic scene that transitions to this private moment.\n\n\nDiego bows. \"It will be done, Your Majesty. I shall have the comprehensive plan ready for your review tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\n\nThe late afternoon sun slants golden through the windows of the Casa de las Palomas as you arrive unannounced. The nurses and tutors scramble to their feet, but you wave them back to their places. You did not come for ceremony.\n\n\nIn the courtyard garden, your children are at play.\n\n\nFernando, now five, sits beneath an orange tree with a book far too advanced for his age—one of the Latin primers you had brought from Toledo. He mouths the words silently, brow furrowed in concentration, occasionally looking up to watch his siblings with the patient expression of someone who finds physical games somewhat baffling but wishes them well nonetheless.\n\n\nThe girls are engaged in some elaborate game involving a ball, a hoop, and rules that seem to shift moment by moment. Teresa, three years old, toddles after Bianca with fierce determination, refusing to accept that her shorter legs cannot keep pace. Bianca, four, plays with the careful fairness of a middle child—slowing down just enough to let Teresa almost catch her, then darting away with a laugh.\n\n\nLittle Juana, barely walking, sits in the nurse's lap clapping at the chaos. And Nicolás, your youngest, sleeps in his cradle in the shade, oblivious to all of it.\n\n\nAnd then there is Catalina.\n\n\nSix years old now, she stands apart from the game, watching. Not with the bookish disinterest of Fernando, but with something sharper—assessing. When Bianca trips and falls, scraping her knee, Catalina is there before the nurses, helping her half-sister up, brushing off her dress, speaking words you cannot hear. Bianca nods and returns to play, tears forgotten.\n\n\nCatalina's eyes find you across the garden. She does not run to you as the younger children might. She inclines her head—a gesture startlingly adult for a six-year-old—and waits.\n\n\nYou watch them all for a long moment. The laughter, the squabbles, the small kindnesses.

He's setting up something - a task for her. This is a significant character moment.\n\nLet me recall what we know about Catalina from the campaign:\n- She's 6 years old (born around 1432)\n- Daughter of Juan and his first wife Isabel of Portugal (who died)\n- She has shown remarkable traits - at the Cortes of 1436, she gave a \"legendary performance\" - brilliant, commanding, but \"spiritually empty\"\n- She's watchful, assessing, precocious\n- She has her mother Isabel's dark hair but Juan's watchful eyes\n\nThis is a touching father-daughter moment. I should portray Catalina authentically - a precocious, intelligent six-year-old who is mature for her age but still a child. She shouldn't be unnaturally perfect or robotic - she should show genuine childlike responses mixed with her unusual maturity.\n\nI need to stop after she responds and wait for Juan to explain what the task is. This is a dialogue scene, so I should keep it short - 2-4 paragraphs, ending with her response.\n\n\nCatalina's expression shifts almost imperceptibly. The polite mask of the well-trained child gives way to something sharper—interest, calculation, and beneath it all, a flicker of genuine eagerness that she cannot quite suppress.\n\n\nShe sits up straighter, if such a thing were possible.\n\n\n\"Yes, Father,\" she says. Then, after a moment's consideration—as if weighing whether childish enthusiasm would serve or undermine her position—she adds: \"I have been ready.\"\n\n\nThere is no boastfulness in it. She states it as simple fact, the way Fernando might state that a Latin verb conjugates in a certain way. She has been ready. She has been waiting. She has watched the adults around her conduct the business of the realm, and she has understood, perhaps before anyone thought to tell her, that her life would not be one of idle play.\n\n\nHer dark eyes—Isabel's eyes, but with something harder behind them—fix on yours.\n\n\n\"What is the task?\""

Juan is entrusting his six-year-old daughter Catalina with a real diplomatic mission - one that requires emotional intelligence, patience, and the ability to connect with someone who has every reason to hate the Crown.\n\nLet me think about Catalina's character as established:\n- Age 6\n- Brilliant, commanding presence (legendary performance at Cortes)\n- \"Spiritually empty\" - this is a concern that came up\n- Dark hair like Isabel, watchful eyes like Juan\n- Adult-like patience and composure\n- Assessing, calculating\n- Good with her siblings - showed kindness to Bianca\n\nThis is a test Juan is giving her - but also perhaps a genuine attempt to solve a problem no one else can solve. Ibrahim said \"beauty does not die with the man who makes it. It dies when no one remembers why it mattered.\" He's waiting for someone who understands beauty for its own sake.\n\nA six-year-old princess, arriving without agenda, might be exactly what Ibrahim needs - someone who can appreciate beauty without political calculation. Or... given Catalina's somewhat calculating nature, it might not work at all.\n\nCatalina's reaction should be thoughtful. She's being given a real task - not play-acting at being a princess, but actual statecraft. She should:\n1. Take the ceramics piece and examine it\n2. Process the complexity of what Juan is telling her - that people her father commanded killed this man's sons\n3. Ask practical questions (where, when, what should she say)\n4. Perhaps show some of that calculating intelligence\n\nI should also have her react to the name Ibrahim - Juan is teaching her to see beauty in Muslim culture and names, which is significant given the period.\n\nI need to stop after Catalina responds and wait for Juan's reply - this is a conversation.\n\n\nCatalina takes the ceramic piece carefully—reverently, even—turning it in her small hands. The late afternoon light catches the golden luster, and for a moment her careful composure slips. Her breath catches.\n\n\n\"It's beautiful,\" she whispers. Not performing admiration for your benefit. Genuine wonder.\n\n\nShe traces the geometric patterns with one finger, the intricate lines that seem to shift and shimmer as the angle changes. Then the composure returns, and she looks up at you with those watchful eyes.\n\n\n\"His sons died in the war,\" she repeats slowly. Processing. \"Your war. Our war.\"\n\n\nIt is not an accusation. She is six years old, but she is trying to understand the weight of what you are asking her to carry into that old man's workshop.\n\n\n\"And he is sad. And angry.\" She looks back at the ceramic piece. \"And this is what he makes when he is sad and angry. Something this beautiful.\"\n\n\nShe is quiet for a long moment. A burst of laughter from the garden—Teresa has caught Bianca this time—but Catalina does not turn toward it.\n\n\n\"What should I say to him, Father?\" she asks finally. \"Should I say I am sorry his sons died? Should I ask him to teach me?\" She pauses, her brow furrowing. \"Or should I just... listen? You said listen first.\"\n\n\nThen, almost as an afterthought: \"Ibrahim. Yes. It sounds like water over stones.\"\n\n\nShe looks up at you, waiting for guidance. For the first time since she sat down, she looks like what she is—a six-year-old girl given a task she wants desperately to complete, but is not entirely sure how."

Juan is giving her a task - to visit Ibrahim al-Fakhkhar, the elderly ceramics master, and simply listen to him. He's being honest with her about the situation, about the weight of war, about loss, and about the limits of power.\n\nThe message from Ibrahim - \"Tell your king that beauty does not die with the man who makes it. It dies when no one remembers why it mattered\" - is profound. Juan is essentially sending someone who might remember why it mattered. A child. His daughter. Not to manipulate, but genuinely to listen and perhaps to understand.\n\nI should write Catalina's response. She's six years old, brilliant, spiritually complex (the \"empty\" observation from earlier chapters), but also genuinely moved by beauty. This is a task that speaks to something real in her. She's being trusted with something important - not a performance like at the Cortes, but a genuine human connection.\n\nI need to capture:\n1. Her processing the weight of what Juan said\n2.

Pure and unguarded. When you set her down, her cheeks are flushed and her careful composure takes a moment to reassemble itself.

He mentioned earlier that she could travel with \"aunt Maria\" and could also ask Lucia (Queen Lucia, her stepmother) to come along if she wanted.\n\nLet me think about who \"aunt Maria\" would be. Looking at the character database and previous chapters... Maria would likely be one of Juan's sisters or a female relative. In the context of the Spanish royal family of this period, this could be María of Aragon (Juan's sister, married to Alfonso V of Aragon - but Alfonso is dead in this timeline and she might be a widow now). \n\nActually, I need to be careful here. Let me think about what makes sense for a six-year-old princess traveling to Granada to meet an elderly Muslim ceramicist.\n\nCatalina now has to decide:\n1. Aunt Maria is coming (that seems to be required - an adult chaperone)\n2. Should she ask Queen Lucia to come too?\n\nThis is a character moment for Catalina. She's six years old, very mature for her age, but still a child. The question of whether to bring Lucia (her stepmother) along is interesting - it speaks to their relationship.\n\nLucia is Catalina's stepmother. Catalina's mother Isabel of Portugal died. How does Catalina feel about Lucia? That's something we haven't fully explored, but given Catalina's personality - she's watchful, calculating, but also has shown moments of genuine emotion.\n\nI should let Catalina respond as a six-year-old would, but one who is unusually thoughtful and strategic. She might have complex feelings about Lucia. She might also be thinking about what would be most helpful for the mission.\n\nLet me write Catalina's response - she should be in character as a precocious but still young child working through this decision.\n\n\nCatalina considers the question with that gravity she brings to everything. You can almost see her weighing options, thinking through implications—a child's mind working through an adult's calculus.\n\n\n\"Aunt María must come. She is kind and the servants listen to her.\" A practical consideration. \"And she speaks some Arabic, doesn't she? From when she lived in Aragón?\"\n\n\nShe pauses, looking down at the ceramic piece in her hands.\n\n\n\"Lucia...\" She trails off. Her relationship with her stepmother is cordial—Lucia has been nothing but gentle with Isabel's children—but there is a distance there. The careful distance of a girl who remembers her mother, however faintly, and is not ready to replace her.\n\n\nBut then Catalina's expression shifts. Thinking not of herself, but of the task.\n\n\n\"Lucia is good with people who are sad,\" she says slowly. \"She knows how to be quiet in the right way. And she is carrying a baby, which makes people... softer. Less angry.\"\n\n\nShe looks up at you, a question in her eyes.\n\n\n\"But this is my task, Father. You gave it to me.\" There is a flicker of something—not quite jealousy, but a fierce protectiveness of this responsibility. \"If Lucia comes, will Ibrahim think the task is hers? That I am just... a child she brought along?\"\n\n\nShe is asking for guidance, but also asserting something. This matters to her. Being seen. Being trusted. Being real, not decorative."

The user set up the Casa de las Palomas arrangement to give the children more normal childhood experiences, so having a commoner friend fits that pattern.\n\nI should have Catalina respond to this clarification - she would likely be relieved (since she was worried about being overshadowed by an adult) and also perhaps pleased that her father knows about her friend and thinks to include her.\n\n\nCatalina's eyes widen, and the tension in her small shoulders releases.

This is a significant event - a 6-year-old princess traveling to meet a bitter, elderly Muslim ceramicist who lost his son in the war and has refused to teach his craft.\n\nLet me think about the factors involved:\n\n**Success Factors:**\n1. Catalina is genuinely moved by the beauty of the ceramics - not performing\n2. She understood Ibrahim's message about \"why it mattered\" - she plans to ask him why it matters to HIM\n3. She's bringing Lucia who can draw - could document his work even if he won't teach\n4. She asked to keep the ceramic piece to show she cared for it - thoughtful gesture\n5. Aunt María is coming - she speaks Arabic, is kind\n6. Catalina is a child - less threatening than an adult emissary\n7. Juan framed this honestly - \"we cannot force men, only ask\"\n8. Catalina's genuine emotional response (the laugh when lifted) shows she's not just a political tool\n9. Ibrahim's message suggests he WANTS someone to understand - \"it dies when no one remembers why it mattered\"\n10. Low pressure approach - Juan told her it's fine if he refuses\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n1. Ibrahim is deeply bitter - his son Ahmad was killed defending the city\n2. Previous approaches failed (Roll 11 - suspicious distance)\n3. Catalina is the conqueror's daughter - her presence could be seen as an insult\n4. She's 6 years old - he might see this as manipulation, using a child\n5. He's 77 and has already reduced production to 40 pieces/year - may be too tired/bitter\n6. Religious divide - Muslim craftsman, Christian princess\n7. The journey itself has risks - travel in medieval times\n8. Ibrahim might see this as another political ploy from the king\n\n\n9. Catalina's famous Cortes performance might work against her - if Ibrahim has heard of it, he might see her as a political tool\n\nHer public performance could potentially undermine her genuine intentions. If Ibrahim has heard about her staged appearance at the Cortes, he might interpret her visit as another calculated political maneuver, dismissing her sincerity and seeing her as a mere instrument of royal propaganda.\n\nThe neutral factors add complexity to the potential encounter. Aunt María's presence could either provide supportive translation and cultural understanding or be perceived as unwelcome supervision. Lucia's artistic skills might be viewed as a respectful documentation of his craft or as a threat of intellectual theft. The ceramic piece Catalina carries is a delicate symbol - it could either touch Ibrahim's heart or painfully remind him of his profound loss.\n\nA child's pure curiosity might penetrate emotional barriers that sophisticated diplomatic strategies cannot breach. Her unfiltered, innocent approach could potentially unlock connections where adult negotiations have repeatedly failed.\n\n\nJourney to Málaga: Princess Catalina's Mission to Ibrahim al-Fakhkhar\n\n\nSummer 1438\n\n\n\nContext\n\n\nSix-year-old Princess Catalina travels to Málaga accompanied by her aunt María (who speaks some Arabic) and her friend Lucia (the seamstress's daughter who draws).

The journey itself goes badly wrong—illness, accident, or bandits. Catalina returns home shaken, the mission abandoned. Ibrahim never even sees her. The experience frightens her; she becomes more guarded, less willing to take risks. María blames herself.\n6-12\nBitter rejection. Ibrahim refuses to see them at all. Word comes through a servant: \"Tell the king's daughter that I have nothing to say to her. Her father's sword killed my son. No child's smile will undo that.\" Catalina is devastated by her first real failure. The ceramic piece feels heavy in her hands on the journey home.\n13-20\nCold reception. Ibrahim allows them in but is stone-faced and monosyllabic. He answers questions with single words. When Catalina shows him the ceramic she carried, he barely glances at it. \"You have seen my workshop. Now go.\" She leaves having learned nothing, feeling she somehow failed without understanding how.\n21-30\nSuspicious distance. Similar to the previous royal approach. Ibrahim is polite but guarded. He shows them his workshop but explains nothing. When Catalina asks why his art matters to him, he is silent for a long moment, then says: \"You are too young to understand.\" He permits Lucia to make a few sketches, but watches her with distrust. No progress, but no ground lost.\n31-40\nA crack in the wall. Ibrahim remains distant, but something Catalina says or does catches his attention. Perhaps she handles a piece with unexpected reverence. Perhaps she asks a question about color rather than technique. He pauses. Looks at her differently. Says nothing of substance, but when they leave, he says: \"You may come again. If you wish.\" A door left open, barely.\n41-50\nRespectful exchange. Ibrahim speaks with Catalina as he might speak to any curious visitor—not warmly, but not coldly. He explains what lusterware is, how the light catches the metallic glaze. When she asks why it matters to him, he says: \"Because my father taught me, and his father taught him.\" He does not offer to teach anyone, but Lucia's drawings are permitted, and he corrects one small detail in her sketch. A fragile respect established.\n51-60\nUnexpected connection. Something breaks through—perhaps Catalina's genuine grief when she speaks of her own mother's death. Ibrahim's eyes change. He speaks of Ahmad, just a little. \"He had clever hands. He would have been better than me.\" He shows Catalina one piece he made after the conquest—dark glazes, sorrowful patterns. \"This is what loss looks like,\" he says. \"Do you understand?\" She says she thinks she does. He nods slowly. Still no promise to teach, but a human connection formed.\n61-70\nThe question answered. When Catalina asks why his art matters to him, Ibrahim is quiet for a long time. Then he takes her to a shelf where a single piece sits apart from the others—a small bowl with a pattern of stars. \"My wife made this. Before she died. She had no training. But she understood why.\" He tells Catalina about beauty, about how it survives those who make it. He allows Lucia to draw everything. He does not promise to teach, but he gives Catalina the star-bowl to take home. \"So you remember why it mattered to her.\"\n71-80\nA student, perhaps. Ibrahim warms to Catalina's questions—and more surprisingly, to Lucia. He watches the seamstress's daughter draw with growing interest. \"She sees,\" he says quietly. \"The girl who draws. She sees how the lines flow.\" He begins explaining his techniques as Lucia sketches—not formally teaching, but not hiding either. When they leave, he tells Catalina: \"Bring the drawing-girl again. There is more she should see.\" A path forward, if carefully walked.\n81-90\n\"She has her grandmother's hands.\" Something in Lucia's careful attention to his work moves Ibrahim deeply. He watches her draw for hours. When she makes a small clay piece under his idle guidance—just playing, really—he stops mid-sentence. Stares at her hands. \"Who taught you this?\" No one, she says. She just watched him. Ibrahim looks at Catalina with an expression she cannot read. \"Your king sent you to ask me to teach. I will not teach Christians who want my secrets for gold. But this one—\" he gestures at Lucia \"—she does not want secrets. She wants to understand.\" He makes no promises, but something fundamental has shifted.\n91-95\nLegacy reconsidered. The visit extends for days. Ibrahim shows them everything—the clay preparation, the glazes, the firing techniques, the metallic lusters that catch the light. He speaks of Ahmad, of his wife, of his father. He weeps once, briefly, and Catalina pretends not to notice. When they finally leave, he says: \"I am old. I will die soon. I thought I would take my art with me, to spite the men who took my son. But spite is a poor legacy.\" He asks that Lucia return—not to learn in secret, but openly, as an apprentice. \"Tell your king that I do not forgive him. But I will not let beauty die to wound him.\"\n96-100\n\"Teach me why it matters.\" Something extraordinary happens. Catalina, six years old, sits with Ibrahim for hours. She does not ask about technique. She asks about his wife, his father, the patterns and what they mean. She asks about Ahmad—and when Ibrahim's voice breaks, she takes his weathered hand in her small one and says nothing at all. Just sits with him in his grief. When she finally asks, \"Will you teach someone?\", he looks at her for a long moment. \"I will teach you,\" he says. \"Not the secrets of the glaze—you are a princess, not a potter. But I will teach you why it matters. And you will remember. And you will tell others. And when you are queen, you will protect the ones who make beautiful things, yes?\" She promises. He begins to talk—really talk—and Lucia draws everything, and María quietly weeps in the corner. Ibrahim will take an apprentice. But more than that: a six-year-old girl has learned something about grief, beauty, and why art outlives the men who make it.\n\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty."

Progress from the previous roll of 11 (suspicious distance). I should narrate this as a scene, showing Catalina's experience, what happened, and end with the outcome. This is her first real diplomatic mission, and while it didn't achieve a dramatic breakthrough, she didn't fail either. She opened a door that was previously closed.\n\nI should show:\n- The journey (uneventful given it's not in the disaster range)\n- The arrival and meeting with Ibrahim\n- The moment where something catches his attention\n- His parting words\n- Catalina's return and report to Juan\n\nI should write this as narrative prose, ending with Catalina reporting back to Juan and stopping to let him respond.\n\n\nA Crack in the Wall\n\n\nLate Summer 1438 — Málaga\n\n\n\nThe journey south is long but uneventful. María proves an able chaperone, keeping the small party moving at a pace that doesn't exhaust the children while maintaining the dignity expected of a royal progress. They travel with a modest escort—enough guards to ensure safety, few enough to avoid the appearance of intimidation.\n\n\nCatalina is serious throughout the journey. She keeps the ceramic piece wrapped in silk in her saddlebag, checking it each night before she sleeps. Lucia sketches everything—the changing landscape, the olive groves, the distant shimmer of the sea as they descend toward the coast.\n\n\nMálaga still bears scars from the siege five years past. Catalina notices. She says nothing, but her eyes linger on a collapsed wall, a burned-out building not yet rebuilt.\n\n\n\nIbrahim al-Fakhkhar's workshop sits in the old Muslim quarter, down a narrow street that smells of clay and woodsmoke. When they arrive, a young servant—a distant relative, perhaps—regards them with barely concealed hostility.\n\n\n\"The master is working. He does not receive visitors.\"\n\n\nMaría steps forward, but Catalina speaks first.\n\n\n\"Please tell him that Catalina has come. I carried something of his a long way, and I would like to return it to him.\"\n\n\nThe servant's eyes flicker to the silk-wrapped bundle in her arms. He disappears inside.\n\n\nThey wait in the street for nearly an hour. Lucia sketches the doorway, the patterns of tile visible through the entrance. María fans herself in the heat and does not complain.\n\n\nFinally, the servant returns.\n\n\n\"He will see you. Briefly.\"\n\n\n\nThe workshop is smaller than Catalina expected. Shelves line every wall, crowded with pieces in various stages of completion. The smell is strange—iteite mineral,ite with something metallic beneath. In the far corner, near a cold kiln, an old man sits on a low stool.\n\n\nIbrahim al-Fakhkhar is thin, his hands gnarled with age, his beard white and unkempt. He does not rise when they enter. His eyes—dark, sharp, unforgiving—fix on Catalina.\n\n\n\"The king's daughter,\" he says. His Castilian is accented but clear. \"He sends a child now. After the letters, the gifts, the pretty words about sorrow and beauty.\"\n\n\n\"He did not send me,\" Catalina says. Her voice is steady, though María notices her hands tightening on the silk bundle. \"He asked if I would come. I said yes.\"\n\n\n\"And why did you say yes?\"\n\n\nCatalina unwraps the ceramic piece—the one Juan gave her, the one she carried all the way from Toledo. She holds it up, and the light from the doorway catches the golden luster, sending soft fire dancing across its surface.\n\n\n\"Because I wanted to know why this is beautiful,\" she says. \"Not beautiful like a dress or a jewel. Beautiful like... like it matters.\"\n\n\nIbrahim says nothing. His expression does not change.\n\n\nThe silence stretches. María shifts uncomfortably. Lucia's hand, poised over her sketching paper, remains still.\n\n\nCatalina takes a breath.\n\n\n\"My father said you sent him a message. That beauty doesn't die with the man who makes it. It dies when no one remembers why it mattered.\" She looks down at the piece in her hands. \"I want to remember. Even if you won't tell me how you make it. I want to understand why you do.\"\n\n\nIbrahim's eyes move from Catalina's face to the ceramic in her hands. Something flickers there—not warmth, not forgiveness, but something.\n\n\n\"You carried that all the way from Toledo?\"\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\"It could have broken.\"\n\n\n\"I was careful.\"\n\n\nAnother silence. Ibrahim's gaze shifts to Lucia, who has been standing motionless, her sketching charcoal hovering over paper.\n\n\n\"What is she doing?\"\n\n\n\"Lucia draws,\" Catalina says. \"She sees things. I thought... if you would let her, she could draw your workshop. Your pieces. So people could see them, even people who never come to Málaga.\"\n\n\nIbrahim stares at Lucia for a long moment. The girl meets his gaze, uncertain but not afraid.\n\n\n\"She has steady hands,\" he says finally. It is not a compliment, exactly. An observation.\n\n\nHe turns back to Catalina.\n\n\n\"I will not teach your father's people my secrets. I will not train Christian apprentices to make golden luster so Castile can grow rich from my family's art.\" His voice is hard, but beneath the hardness there is exhaustion. \"My son is dead. My grandson is in Fez. When I die, this—\" he gestures at the workshop around them \"—dies with me. That is my choice.\"\n\n\nCatalina nods slowly. \"My father said it was your choice. He said we cannot force men to do anything. Only ask.\"\n\n\nSomething in Ibrahim's face shifts. Surprise, perhaps. Or simply the recognition of something unexpected.\n\n\n\"Your father said that?\"\n\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\nThe old man is quiet for a long time. He looks at the ceramic piece in Catalina's hands—his own work, carried hundreds of miles by a child who wanted to understand why it mattered.\n\n\n\"Go,\" he says finally. His voice is gruff, dismissive. \"I have work to do.\"\n\n\nMaría begins to guide the children toward the door. But as they reach the threshold, Ibrahim speaks again.\n\n\n\"You may come again. If you wish.\"\n\n\nCatalina turns. The old man is not looking at her. He has picked up a piece of unfired clay and is turning it over in his gnarled hands, examining it as though they were not there.\n\n\n\"I will,\" she says.\n\n\nHe does not respond.\n\n\n\nReturn to Toledo — One Week Later\n\n\nCatalina finds you in your study, still dusty from the road. She has not even changed from her traveling clothes. María hovers in the doorway, looking uncertain whether to intervene.\n\n\n\"Father.\"\n\n\nCatalina stands before you, the ceramic piece still in her hands. She looks tired—the journey was long for a six-year-old—but beneath the exhaustion there is something else. Not triumph. Not disappointment. Something more complicated.\n\n\n\"I went to see Ibrahim. He let us into his workshop.\" She pauses, choosing her words with care. \"He said he will not teach anyone. He said when he dies, his art dies with him. That is his choice.\"\n\n\nShe looks down at the ceramic in her hands.\n\n\n\"But when we left, he said I may come again. If I wish.\"\n\n\nShe looks up at you, and for a moment she is not the composed diplomat, not the girl who commanded the Cortes. She is a child who has encountered something she does not fully understand—grief and beauty and stubbornness and loss, all tangled together in an old man's workshop.\n\n\n\"Did I do well, Father?\""

He's comforting Catalina and moving on to practical matters (food, rest after the journey).\n\nThis is a nice moment of parenting - Juan acknowledging Catalina did well even though the mission didn't fully succeed, accepting the outcome philosophically, and taking care of his daughter's immediate needs.\n\nI should write a short, warm scene of this moment. Catalina's reaction to her father's acceptance, and perhaps a small moment of connection. Then I can wrap up this scene naturally.\n\nThe roll of 37 means \"A crack in the wall\" - the door is left slightly open. Ibrahim said she may come again. This isn't a failure, but it's not success either. It's a possibility that may or may not lead anywhere.\n\nI shouldn't overwrite this - it's a quiet moment between father and daughter. Keep it brief and let the scene breathe.\n\n\nCatalina nods slowly. There is something in her expression—a flicker of disappointment, perhaps, that she could not achieve more. She is young enough to believe that wanting something badly and trying hard should be enough to make it happen.\n\n\nBut she is also her father's daughter. She watches you accept the outcome without bitterness, without recrimination, and something in her settles.\n\n\n\"He was very sad, Father,\" she says quietly as you walk together toward the family quarters. \"Not angry, like I expected. Just... sad. Like the sadness had been there so long it had become part of him.\"\n\n\nShe is quiet for a moment, her small hand finding yours.\n\n\n\"Lucia drew his workshop. All his pieces, the kiln, his tools. She said she wanted to remember, even if no one else would.\" A pause. \"Was that all right? He watched her draw, but he didn't tell her to stop.\"\n\n\n\nAt dinner, Catalina eats ravenously—the appetite of a child who has been on the road for days finally catching up with her. María reports that she was brave and composed throughout the journey, that she spoke to Ibrahim without prompting, that she did not cry even when he was harsh.\n\n\n\"She has a gift,\" María says quietly, when Catalina is distracted by a conversation with Fernando about something she saw on the road. \"Not for persuasion—she didn't persuade him of anything. But for presence. She made him see her. Not as the king's daughter, not as a symbol. As a person who cared.\"\n\n\nShe hesitates.\n\n\n\"He said she could return.
