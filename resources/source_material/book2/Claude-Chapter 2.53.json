Ready to proceed with Cortes summoning and governance reforms.\n\nThe chapter ended with the Madrid construction plan having just been approved. The council is still in session with the architects present. Juan is healthy.\n\nKey unresolved threads:\n1. Hungarian succession - awaiting news\n2. Personal journey to Poland-Hungary - deferred\n3. Cortes summoning - planned\n4. France negotiations - ongoing\n5. Tenedos meeting with Sultan Murad II - pending\n6. Queen Lucia's pregnancy - expected August/September 1439\n7. Crusade timeline - Ottoman truce expires 1445\n8. Madrid construction - begins 1440\n\nI should present a brief introduction that orients the player to exactly where they left off - in the council chambers with the Madrid plan just approved.\n\n\nChapter 2.53\n\n\nLate April 1439, Afternoon\n\n\nThe sunlight slants through the high windows of the Alcázar's council chambers, casting long rectangles across the parchment-strewn table where the three architects' drawings are spread. The Madrid plan—your great symbol of imperial ambition rendered in ink and vision—has just received your final approval. Maestro Lorenzo is already rolling up his practical construction diagrams, while Maestro Giorgio lingers over the design sketches of the Iota Monument with the particular satisfaction of an artist who has found a patron worthy of his dreams. Maestro Willem stands apart, making notes on a wax tablet about water tables and drainage grades.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna remains seated at your right hand, his stylus already moving as he drafts preliminary notes for the Council of Realms charter you've commissioned. Queen Lucia watches the proceedings from her place beside you, her expression thoughtful—she raised concerns about the personal journey to Poland-Hungary earlier, and that matter remains unresolved, deferred until news arrives about Queen Elisabeth's child and whether Władysław III will secure the Hungarian throne to add to his Polish crown.\n\n\nIsaac de Baeza stands near the door, ever watchful, his intelligence networks having delivered their reports on England's cold withdrawal, Burgundy's commercial pragmatism, and France's unexpected openness. The Ottoman assessment—Murad's patient expansion, his fleet doubling at Gallipoli, his eastern flank secured—hangs in the air like an unspoken urgency.\n\n\nDiego de Daza shuffles through financial memoranda, likely already calculating mint production schedules for the new Iota coinage at Granada.\n\n\nThe council awaits your next word."

From the chapter summary, the Crown Marshalls system was just approved but \"appointments pending\" - meaning they haven't actually been appointed yet. The system was proposed as having a permanent royal representative in each realm (Castile, Aragon, Valencia, Naples, Sicily, Granada, Constantinople).\n\n2. So there aren't actually any crown marshalls yet - they're a new position that was just proposed and approved in the previous chapter.\n\n3. Tax assessors would exist though - Diego de Daza has been running financial reforms since early in the campaign.\n\nI need to handle this carefully. The player may have forgotten that the Crown Marshalls haven't been appointed yet - they were just proposed as a concept. I should have an NPC gently remind Juan of this, or clarify the situation naturally through the narrative.\n\nLet me have Álvaro or Diego de Daza point this out diplomatically.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna looks up from his notes, his stylus pausing mid-stroke. \"Your Majesty,\" he says carefully, \"the Crown Marshalls have not yet been appointed. We approved the concept this very afternoon—the positions remain empty until you name men to fill them.\"\n\n\nHe sets down his tablet. \"If you wish to proceed with appointments now, we should discuss candidates for each realm. Castile, Aragón, Valencia, Naples, Sicily, Granada, Constantinople—seven positions requiring men of exceptional ability and unquestionable loyalty.\" A slight pause. \"Men who can represent royal authority without overstepping it. A delicate balance.\"\n\n\nDiego de Daza, however, is already rising. \"The tax assessors, Your Majesty—those I can summon readily. I have perhaps a dozen senior men currently in Toledo working on the Granada mining accounts and the treasury reconciliation. They could be assembled within the hour.\" He tilts his head slightly. \"May I ask what purpose you have in mind? It would help me determine which specialists would be most useful—the mining assessors, the customs men, the alcabala collectors, or those who handle ecclesiastical revenues?\"\n\n\nQueen Lucia glances at you with quiet interest, clearly curious about this sudden shift from architectural visions to fiscal administration."

They work alongside tax assessors when collection becomes difficult, and the system was implemented in Naples and Aragon after those were inherited.\n\nI need to check the project knowledge to see if there's documentation about this existing system. The player is essentially saying I made an error by claiming the Crown Marshalls don't exist yet - they're saying this is an existing institution, not a new proposal.\n\nLet me search for information about this system in the project files.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Recognized existing Crown Marshall system and corrected misunderstanding.\n\nNow I understand - the Crown Marshalls have been in place since 1431, during Juan's first year of reign. They were created during the Cortes of November 1431. The system started with 3 Crown Marshalls and expanded to 12 by December 1432. They work with tax assessors and have enforcement powers.\n\nThe player is correct - this is an existing system, not a new proposal. The Chapter 2.52 summary mentions \"Crown Marshalls\" as a new proposal, but that seems to have been about formalizing the system across the expanded empire (the seven realms) with permanent representatives - not creating the system from scratch.\n\nI need to acknowledge my error and correct course. Álvaro would know about the Crown Marshalls - he helped design them!\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna's expression shifts to one of mild embarrassment. \"Forgive me, Your Majesty—I spoke carelessly. Of course the Crown Marshalls exist.\" He sets down his stylus. \"I designed the system myself in 1431. Twelve marshalls covering Castile, expanded to the new territories as we acquired them.\"\n\n\nHe folds his hands. \"What I proposed this afternoon was something different—permanent royal representatives in each realm's capital, a step beyond the marshalls who travel with assessors. But you are correct that the enforcement system itself has functioned well for eight years now.\"\n\n\nDiego de Daza nods, recovering his footing. \"The Crown Marshalls have been invaluable, Your Majesty. When I send assessors to review noble accounts or investigate suspected evasion, the presence of a marshall transforms cooperation remarkably. Most disputes resolve themselves when a man in royal livery stands beside the assessor.\"\n\n\nHe considers your request. \"I can summon both groups—we have three marshalls currently in Toledo or nearby, and as I mentioned, a dozen senior assessors working the Granada accounts. Within an hour, perhaps two, I could have them assembled.\" He pauses. \"Shall I also send for the marshalls assigned to Aragón and Naples? That would take longer—days for messages to reach them and weeks for travel.\"\n\n\n\"What matter requires their attention, Your Majesty?\" Álvaro asks, his earlier embarrassment replaced by practical curiosity."

Five days' hard riding. He should make it.

The idea was that 10-12 great families would voluntarily police their own tax compliance, creating peer pressure instead of royal coercion.\n\nLet me recall what I found in the project knowledge search:\n- Don Íñigo López de Orozco proposed it\n- It was a voluntary association of great families\n- They would internally audit family members' tax compliance\n- The Mendoza family demonstrated this by finding underpayments and voluntarily paying 50% MORE than legally owed\n- Juan enthusiastically supported the concept\n\nNow the user is asking about how this Council of Great Houses works with the Crown Marshalls. This is an interesting question because theoretically, if the Council is working well, there shouldn't be friction with the great houses.\n\nDon Íñigo just said that great lords are difficult - they have their own retainers, their stewards treat marshalls as equals or irritants, and they calculate that the crown won't pursue them.\n\nSo there's a disconnect here. The Council of Great Houses was supposed to solve this problem through peer pressure and voluntary compliance. If Don Íñigo is still having problems with great lords, either:\n1. The Council isn't working as intended\n2. Not all great houses are part of the Council\n3. Some houses joined but don't follow through\n4. The Council handles some matters but not all\n\nI need to have Don Íñigo respond realistically. He's a Mendoza himself (or at least, the original proposer was from the Mendoza family). So he has insight into how the Council works.\n\nActually, wait - I need to be careful here. Don Íñigo López de Orozco was identified as the head of the Mendoza family in the search results, and he proposed the Council. But he's ALSO one of the Crown Marshalls. So he has a dual role - he's both part of the noble establishment that created the Council AND a Crown Marshall enforcing compliance.\n \nI recognize the nuanced reality of inter-noble relationships. Some houses genuinely embrace the Council's principles, while others pay lip service. The Mendoza family leads by example, but not every noble house shares our commitment to transparent governance. Peer pressure works in some instances, but when royal interests directly conflict with noble privileges, cooperation becomes more complex.\n\n\nDon Íñigo's expression shifts subtly—a flicker of something between pride and resignation.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty recalls that I proposed that Council myself, on behalf of my family.\" A faint smile. \"And among the houses that participate genuinely—the Mendozas, the Manriques, the Velascos, a handful of others—it works as intended. When an assessor finds a discrepancy in a Mendoza vassal's accounts, I do not ride out with threats. I send word to the family's head, and the matter is resolved quietly. Honor is preserved. The crown receives its due. No one speaks of marshalls or fines.\"\n\n\nHe shifts his weight. \"But the Council was always voluntary, Your Majesty. Twelve families joined in the first year. Perhaps fifteen now. There are...\"\n\n\nHe glances at Álvaro de Luna, as if seeking permission to speak plainly.\n\n\n\"There are great houses that never joined. They smiled at the proposal, praised its spirit, and declined to submit their accounts to peer review. The Guzmáns of Medina Sidonia, for instance. The Pimentels. They are not hostile to the crown—they pay most of what they owe, most of the time. But they did not wish other families examining their affairs.\"\n\n\nGarcía Fernández de Villalobos, the marshall from León, speaks up unbidden. \"And even among the houses that joined, Your Majesty, the younger sons and distant cousins do not always feel bound by what the family head agreed to. I have had... awkward encounters.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo nods. \"The Council prevents conflict with houses that wish to avoid conflict. It cannot compel those who prefer to take their chances.\""

He found that a certain great house had been routing wool exports through a factor who claimed exemptions the house was not entitled to. The sum was not trivial. Perhaps twelve thousand maravedís over three years.\"\n\n\n\"The assessor sent a polite inquiry to the house's steward. The steward replied—equally politely—that the exemptions were valid, citing a privilege granted by Your Majesty's grandfather. The assessor requested documentation. The steward promised to search the archives. Weeks passed. The documentation never arrived.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo stops pacing.\n\n\n\"So the assessor requested my involvement. I rode to the estate myself—three days' travel—and presented myself at the gate. I was received courteously. Fed well. Given a fine room. The lord was unfortunately away hunting. The steward repeated his claims about the privilege. I asked to see the original document. He said it was stored at another property. I said I would wait.\"\n\n\nA dry smile crosses his face.\n\n\n\"I waited nine days, Your Majesty. Nine days of excellent hospitality and vague assurances. When the document finally appeared, it was genuine—but it granted exemption on grain exports, not wool. A simple error, the steward said. These old documents are so difficult to interpret.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"What was I to do? I could not arrest a duke's steward for creative reading. I issued a formal finding that the exemption did not apply and the sum was owed. The steward thanked me graciously and said he would consult with his lord.\"\n\n\n\"Three months later, after two more letters from Diego's office and a suggestion that the matter might be raised with Your Majesty directly, the house paid. In full. With no admission of wrongdoing and a letter expressing surprise that there had been any confusion.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo meets your eyes. \"We recovered the money. But I spent nine days in a castle being fed roast boar while a steward played games with me. Multiply that across a dozen such cases each year, and you see the difficulty. The great houses do not refuse. They delay. They reinterpret. They misplace documents. They are never available. And because they are great houses, we cannot simply seize assets or clap men in irons as we might with a minor hidalgo who owes fifty maravedís.\"\n\n\nOne of the assessors—a balding man with ink-stained fingers—mutters something under his breath.

But if I may speak as a Mendoza as well as a marshall—the great houses accepted your reforms because they saw them as fair. Strict, yes. But fair. A procedure that moves from 'disputed customs exemption' to 'army at the gates' in ninety days... or forty...\" He hesitates. \"Some will call it tyranny. Not because it is, but because it serves their purposes to say so.\"\n\n\nRodrigo de Perea, the Granada marshall, speaks up—a younger man, less cautious. \"The Granadan lords comply because they remember conquest. They saw what happens when the crown moves against those who defy it. Perhaps the Castilian lords need reminding.\"\n\n\nGarcía Fernández de Villalobos shakes his head. \"Granada's lords had no ancient privileges to cite.

This is a practical question about their authority and resources.\n\nLet me think about what the marshalls actually have at their disposal based on the earlier search results:\n\nFrom the Book 1 chronicle:\n- Crown Marshals have authority to investigate noble tax compliance\n- Issue warnings and fines for non-compliance\n- Report persistent defiance to the crown\n- Coordinate with church authorities on excommunications\n- Stage 2 warning: 50% fine of original obligation\n- Maximum fine authority: 10,000 maravedís\n- Report to crown for military enforcement if necessary\n- Salary: 350 maravedís/month (~4,200 maravedís annually = ~15.8 florins)\n\nSo they have limited authority - they can investigate, warn, fine up to 10,000 maravedís, and report to the crown for military enforcement. But they don't have troops of their own. They're essentially administrators with badges, not military commanders.\n\nThe question Juan is asking is whether they can actually escalate effectively when needed. The answer is probably \"no, not really\" - they have to report to the crown and request military action, which is a slow process and requires royal attention.\n\nLet me have Don Íñigo answer honestly about the limitations.\n\n\nDon Íñigo exchanges a look with the other marshalls before answering.\n\n\n\"In truth, Your Majesty? No.\"\n\n\nHe speaks without bitterness, simply stating fact.\n\n\n\"My authority extends to investigation, formal warnings, and fines up to ten thousand maravedís. For a minor lord, that is significant. For a duke?\" He shrugs. \"A rounding error in his household accounts. If he chooses to ignore my fine, I can only report the defiance to Toledo and request... escalation.\"\n\n\nHe gestures vaguely toward Álvaro. \"That report goes to Don Álvaro, or to Diego, who decides whether the matter warrants Your Majesty's attention.

Most of the time, that assumption holds.

I should have him explain the strategic importance of each.\n\nToledo - the current capital, seat of the court, where the royal family resides\nSegovia - important royal fortress, treasury location, the Alcázar of Segovia\nBurgos - historic capital of Castile, important crossroads\nValladolid - major city, often used for Cortes meetings\n\nI should have the captain give a soldier's practical assessment of why each matters.\n\n\nCaptain Rodrigo straightens slightly, as if reciting a familiar inventory.\n\n\n\"Toledo first, Your Majesty, as it should be. The Alcázar where we stand now. Forty men here—the largest garrison. We guard the royal family, the treasury, the archives. When the Cortes meets, we secure the halls. This is the heart of the kingdom; it must never be vulnerable.\"\n\n\nHe holds up a second finger.\n\n\n\"Segovia. Thirty-five men. The Alcázar there holds the secondary treasury—the reserves Your Majesty does not keep close at hand. Also the royal mint, where the new coins are struck. And the state prisoners, when there are any. The fortress itself is nearly impregnable, but a fortress without men is just stone.\"\n\n\nA third finger.\n\n\n\"Burgos. Thirty-five men. The old capital, and still the gateway to the north. The roads to France, to Navarre, to the Basque country—they all pass through Burgos. We guard the royal apartments there for when Your Majesty travels, and we watch the northern merchants who pass through. Also...\" He hesitates. \"Burgos is where loyalty has wavered before. The northern lords remember the old ways. A royal presence reminds them whose kingdom this is.\"\n\n\nA fourth finger.\n\n\n\"Valladolid. Thirty men, the smallest garrison. It guards the royal chancery archives—the old records, the land grants, the genealogies. Papers, Your Majesty, but papers that prove who owns what. Men have killed for less.\"\n\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\n\"The remaining men—perhaps ten at any time—are in transit, on leave, or recovering from illness or injury. That is the truth of it, Your Majesty. Four cities, four purposes, stretched thin.\""

There are tax assessors working across the kingdom - Diego mentioned about a dozen senior assessors in Toledo alone. If they need guards (mentioned 2-4 earlier), and they travel to various locations throughout Castile, Aragon, Granada, etc., this could require a significant number of men.\n\nLet me think about the logistics:\n- Tax assessors travel to estates to review accounts\n- They need protection, especially when visiting hostile or difficult lords\n- The suggestion was 2 guards per assessor\n- How many assessors are there? Diego mentioned a dozen senior ones in Toledo, but there must be more across the kingdom\n- The assessors don't all travel at once, but they do travel frequently\n\nCaptain Rodrigo should give a thoughtful, practical military answer. He would need to consider:\n- How many assessors are in the field at any given time\n- Travel time and rotation\n- The geographic spread of the kingdom\n- He might not know exact numbers and would need to consult with Diego\n\nLet me have him think through this practically and give a reasonable estimate. He's a military man, so he'll think in terms of logistics and coverage.\n\n\nCaptain Rodrigo turns his gaze toward Diego de Daza. \"How many assessors do you have in the field at any given time? And how far do they travel?\"\n\n\nDiego considers. \"At present, perhaps twenty to twenty-five assessors actively traveling across Castile and Granada at any time. More during assessment season—spring and autumn—when we review the major accounts. Fewer in winter. They travel everywhere, Captain. From Santiago to Murcia, from Seville to the Basque frontier.\"\n\n\nThe captain's eyes narrow as he calculates.\n\n\n\"Two guards per assessor. That is the minimum for any real protection—one man alone can be overwhelmed, but two can stand back to back.\" He begins thinking aloud. \"Twenty-five assessors, two guards each, that is fifty men in the field at any moment. But men cannot ride forever. For every man in the field, you need another resting, another in transit, another recovering or on leave. Triple the number to maintain rotation.\"\n\n\nHe looks back to you.\n\n\n\"One hundred fifty men, Your Majesty. Dedicated solely to assessor protection. That would provide reliable coverage across Castile and Granada without exhausting the men or leaving assessors waiting weeks for an escort.\"\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\"If you wish to extend this protection to Aragón, Valencia, Naples, and Sicily...\" He shakes his head slowly. \"Double it. Perhaps more. The distances are greater, the territories unfamiliar. Three hundred men, minimum, to cover the full empire.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"That is a company, Your Majesty. A significant expense. But if you are serious about protecting your assessors—truly serious—that is what it costs.\""

He's a military man, so he'll think about this from a security and logistics perspective.\n\nDiego de Daza and the assessors themselves might have input too, since they know the realities of their work better.\n\n\nCaptain Rodrigo frowns, not in disapproval but in thought. He looks toward the assessors.\n\n\n\"That depends on the men doing the assessing. Do they know when danger is coming? Or does it arrive unexpected?\"\n\n\nMartín de Cuéllar, the assessor who spoke of the dogs, answers slowly. \"Sometimes we know, Captain. When I am sent to review a lord who has been... difficult before, I know there may be trouble. When I visit a merchant's warehouse in Toledo to check customs receipts, I do not fear for my life.\"\n\n\nThe younger assessor who was locked in the storeroom shifts uncomfortably. \"But I did not expect what happened in Ávila. The lord had no history of defiance. His accounts were only slightly irregular. I thought it would be a simple visit.\"\n\n\nDiego de Daza strokes his chin. \"We could establish categories, Your Majesty. Routine assessments in cities, among cooperative merchants and minor landholders—no escort needed. First visits to noble estates—perhaps two guards as a matter of course, to establish that the crown takes these matters seriously. Known troublesome lords, or second and third visits after disputes...\" He glances at the captain. \"Four guards, as Your Majesty suggested.\"\n\n\nCaptain Rodrigo nods slowly. \"A tiered system. That reduces the numbers considerably. If only a third of assessments require escort at any time, and half of those need only two men rather than four...\"\n\n\nHe calculates silently.\n\n\n\"Fifty additional men might suffice for Castile and Granada. Sixty to be safe. Not a full company, but a dedicated platoon. Based here in Toledo, dispatched as needed, returning between assignments.\" He pauses. \"It requires coordination. Someone must track which assessors need guards, when, and where. But it is manageable.\"\n\n\nHe looks to you. \"Shall I draw up a proposal, Your Majesty?\""

For the first time, something like a smile tugs at the corner of his mouth.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty understands soldiers.\"\n\n\nHe nods slowly, warming to the idea. \"Garrison duty is necessary, but it is dull work.

If the guards are always the same dedicated platoon, the lords learn their faces, test their limits. But if every escort is different—men from Segovia one month, Burgos the next—the lords never know who they are dealing with.\"\n\n\nCaptain Rodrigo builds on this. \"We could rotate by garrison. Toledo's men escort assessors for two months, then return to garrison while Segovia's men take the duty. Each posting gets variety. Each man travels. No one grows stale.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, the practical concerns returning.\n\n\n\"We would need slightly more men overall—perhaps thirty or forty additional—to cover the gaps when soldiers are in transit or resting between assignments.

This is essentially creating a secret investigative force or intelligence operatives.\n\nLet me think about how the NPCs would react to this:\n\n1. Álvaro de Luna - He's a skilled political operator. He might see both the value and the dangers of such a force. He'd probably be cautiously supportive but raise concerns about oversight and control.\n\n2. Don Íñigo López de Orozco - As the head of the Mendoza family and senior marshall, he might have mixed feelings. On one hand, it's a useful tool. On the other, secret agents operating without visibility could be concerning to the nobility.\n\n3. Isaac de Baeza - Wait, is Isaac de Baeza present? Looking back at the chapter summary and the scene... Isaac de Baeza was present at the council meeting at the start, but this meeting is specifically with marshalls and assessors. Let me check who was summoned to this meeting.\n\nThe player summoned crown marshalls and tax assessors. Isaac de Baeza is the spymaster - he wasn't specifically mentioned as being in this meeting. This is important because Isaac already runs intelligence operations. The \"black marshalls\" concept overlaps with what Isaac does.\n\nActually, this creates an interesting dynamic. Juan is essentially proposing to create a parallel intelligence/investigation structure within the marshall system. Álvaro might point out that Isaac already does this work.\n\nLet me think about how the NPCs would realistically respond:\n\n- The marshalls might be intrigued by the idea of having covert colleagues who can do the work they cannot\n- Álvaro would likely point out that Isaac de Baeza already handles covert intelligence\n- There might be questions about how black marshalls differ from Isaac's network\n- Practical concerns: who selects these men? Who do they report to? How do we prevent abuse?\n\nThe nobles in the room (Don Íñigo is a Mendoza) might also be somewhat uncomfortable with the idea of secret royal agents moving through the realm undetected. It echoes concerns about royal overreach.\n\n\nI'll craft a nuanced response that balances the proposal's potential benefits with the legitimate concerns raised by key stakeholders. I'll highlight the unique value of these covert marshalls while addressing potential overlaps with existing intelligence networks and noble sensitivities.\n\n\nA different kind of silence falls over the room now. The marshalls exchange glances—this is new territory, far removed from tax collection and escort duties.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna speaks first, his voice careful. \"Your Majesty... you are describing something that already exists, in part. Isaac de Baeza maintains networks throughout the realm and beyond. His people move unseen, gather information, report on threats.\" He pauses delicately. \"How would these black marshalls differ from Isaac's agents?\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo shifts his weight, clearly uncomfortable. \"Your Majesty, I must speak as a noble as well as a marshall. The great houses accept the marshalls because we operate openly. We arrive with badges, deliver demands, file reports. There is no mystery about what we do or who we serve.\" He chooses his next words with care. \"Secret agents of the crown, moving through the realm with hidden authority... some will call this the work of tyrants. Whether justly or not.\"\n\n\nRodrigo de Perea, the younger Granada marshall, sees it differently. \"In Granada, Your Majesty, the Moors maintained such men for centuries. Sahib al-shurta—masters of the watch who moved among the people, listening, watching. It kept the peace. The criminals feared what they could not see.\"\n\n\nCaptain Rodrigo de Mendoza frowns thoughtfully. \"From a soldier's view—who commands these men? Who ensures they do not exceed their authority, or pursue private vendettas under color of royal service? A man who operates in shadow needs a firm hand holding his leash.\"\n\n\nThe room waits for your response."

This is a more traditionally medieval concept - itinerant royal agents who represent the king's justice wherever they go.\n\nThis is much more palatable to the nobles in the room, as it's open and honorable rather than secretive. Let me have the NPCs react to this revised proposal.\n\n\nThe tension in the room eases noticeably. Don Íñigo's shoulders relax.\n\n\n\"That is a different matter entirely, Your Majesty,\" he says, and there is approval in his voice. \"A knight who rides openly under royal authority, answerable to the crown, free to go where duty calls him—that is an ancient and honorable tradition.

Such men are rare.\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nJuan's reputation is at its zenith—Defender of Romania, conqueror of Granada, ruler of five crowns\n\nThe Military Orders have been transformed under Juan's leadership and serve loyally\n\nThe position is prestigious—direct service to the King with authority to act in his name\n\nFormal inquiry through proper channels (Álvaro to Grand Masters)\n\nLarge pool of knights across three major Orders\n\nPeacetime means capable men may seek meaningful service\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nRequirements are extraordinarily specific—the intersection of martial virtue, wisdom, patience, literacy, and independence is rare\n\nThe best knights already hold important positions within their Orders\n\nGrand Masters may be reluctant to part with their finest men\n\nDominicans are friars, not knights—can advise but not fill the martial role\n\nOnly three positions needed, but three perfect candidates is a high bar\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nEmbarrassing Failure. The Orders reply politely but offer no suitable candidates. The men proposed are clearly inadequate—aged, infirm, or of questionable judgment. The search must be widened or delayed.\n6-15\nPoor Results. One marginally acceptable candidate is identified, but he has significant drawbacks (too old, too rigid, limited language skills). The other Orders offer excuses. You may appoint one Itinerant Marshall or continue searching.\n16-30\nMixed Results. Two candidates of reasonable quality are found—capable knights, though perhaps lacking the exceptional wisdom you sought. The third position remains unfilled. You may appoint two now and continue the search for the third.\n31-50\nAdequate Success. Three candidates are identified who meet the basic requirements. They are good men—loyal, capable, literate—but not extraordinary. Solid appointments, if not inspired ones.\n51-70\nGood Success. Three strong candidates emerge. Two are clearly excellent; the third is solid but less distinguished. The Orders have taken your request seriously and offered worthy men.\n71-85\nExcellent Results. Three exceptional candidates are presented—men whose names you may already know by reputation. Each Order has offered one of their finest, seeing the honor in serving the King directly.\n86-95\nOutstanding Success. Three remarkable candidates, and a fourth of nearly equal quality presents himself unbidden, having heard of the search. You have the luxury of choice, and perhaps a reserve candidate for future needs.\n96-100\nExtraordinary Discovery. The search reveals not only three perfect candidates but uncovers a man of truly legendary reputation—a knight-scholar whose wisdom and virtue are spoken of across Christendom. His willingness to serve would be a statement in itself.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

Each Order has offered one of their finest, seeing the honor in serving the King directly.\"\n\nNow I need to create three compelling NPCs - one from each Military Order (Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara). These should be exceptional men, knights of proven virtue, wisdom, and judgment. Let me craft them carefully.\n\nThe scene: Juan welcomes them at his palace. I should describe the arrival and introduce each candidate, then let Juan interact with them.\n\nLet me think about what kind of men these would be:\n\n1. From the Order of Santiago - perhaps a veteran of the Granada campaign, known for both martial prowess and wise counsel\n2. From the Order of Calatrava - maybe a man known for his patience and investigative mind\n3. From the Order of Alcántara - perhaps someone with experience in the frontier regions, known for working alone\n\nI should make them distinct in personality and background, but all clearly exceptional. Let me write this scene.\n\n\nThree Weeks Later\n\n\nLate May 1439, Morning\n\n\nThe responses arrive over the course of weeks—formal letters from the Grand Masters, followed by the candidates themselves. Each Order, it seems, has taken the inquiry as a matter of honor, offering not merely acceptable men but knights whose reputations precede them.\n\n\nThey arrive on the same day, whether by coincidence or coordination—three men in the distinctive habits of their Orders, dismounting in the Alcázar courtyard within hours of each other. Álvaro has arranged for them to be received together, that you might take their measure side by side.\n\n\nThe great hall is quiet when they enter. Afternoon light streams through the high windows. The three knights approach and kneel before the throne.\n\n\n\nFray Gonzalo de Quiroga, Order of Santiago. Perhaps fifty years of age, his beard grey but his bearing still that of a fighting man. He served in the Granada campaign—you may recall his name from reports of the siege of Málaga, where he held a breach in the walls for six hours with twenty men. But his reputation rests equally on what came after: he spent three years as the Order's commissioner in the newly conquered territories, settling disputes between settlers and local converts, earning a name for judgments that satisfied no one completely but that everyone accepted as fair. He speaks Castilian, Latin, and passable Arabic.\n\n\nFray Martín de Sotomayor, Order of Calatrava. Younger—perhaps forty—with the watchful eyes of a man who listens more than he speaks. He served as the Order's investigator for a decade, rooting out corruption within Calatrava's own commanderies. Three times, his inquiries led to the removal of commanders who had abused their positions. He is known for patience that borders on the unsettling—he once spent eight months in a single town, asking questions, before presenting evidence that convicted a commander of murder. He reads and writes Latin, Castilian, and Italian.\n\n\nFray Diego de Castañeda, Order of Alcántara. The eldest at perhaps fifty-five, lean and weathered, with the quiet manner of a man comfortable with solitude. He spent twenty years on the Portuguese frontier, often alone, serving as the Order's eyes in disputed territories. He knows every path between the Tagus and the Guadiana, and is said to have prevented two border wars through early warnings delivered at personal risk. He speaks Castilian, Portuguese, and enough Leonese dialect to pass unnoticed in the northern mountains.\n\n\nThe three rise from their knees and stand before you, waiting."

They traveled to Toledo knowing they were being considered for a special position. They are men of proven virtue who have dedicated their lives to service—Gonzalo de Quiroga held a breach for six hours and then spent three years settling disputes fairly; Martín de Sotomayor spent a decade rooting out corruption; Diego de Castañeda spent twenty years on the frontier alone. \n\nThis is NOT a case where Juan is asking them to do something against their nature. He's offering them exactly the kind of meaningful service they've spent their lives pursuing, but with MORE authority, MORE resources, and MORE prestige. He's framing it in religious terms that align perfectly with their identities as knights of religious Military Orders.\n\n**Would they refuse?** The honest answer is: probably not, unless there are specific concerns. These men were nominated for this role, they came here knowing what was being offered, and the position aligns with their demonstrated values and skills.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- Leaving their Orders (though they remain brothers of the Order, just on royal service)\n- Specific terms and conditions\n- What exactly \"no jurisdiction, no borders\" means in practice\n- Accountability—to whom do they answer?\n- Family concerns (though Military Order knights have limited family obligations)\n- The religious framing—does it match their understanding of duty?\n\n**Juan's Approach Quality:**\n- Strong religious framing appealing to their faith\n- Poetic language about light and darkness\n- Clear mission statement (protect innocent, shield weak, help faithful)\n- Promises full authority and support\n- Queen Lucia present adds solemnity\n\n\n- Lacks precise operational details, which could be a potential weakness\n\nI notice the proposal has significant gaps in practical implementation. While the knights' background and motivations strongly suggest acceptance, the vague operational framework might raise subtle reservations. The lack of concrete accountability and specific terms could create uncertainty, despite the compelling overall vision. The success factors heavily outweigh potential hesitations, with their prior service, reputation, and alignment with religious ideals making this opportunity extremely attractive.\n\nThe key tension emerges between the inspirational rhetoric and the undefined practical boundaries. Their acceptance seems almost inevitable, but the manner of acceptance—whether cautious or enthusiastic—remains the critical variable.\n\n\nPersuasion Analysis: Recruiting the Itinerant Marshalls\n\n\n\nStep 1: The Ask\n\n\nJuan is asking three knights—already nominated by their Grand Masters and traveled to Toledo for this purpose—to accept appointment as Itinerant Marshalls, roving agents of royal justice with broad authority and no fixed jurisdiction.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Honest Assessment\n\n\n\"If I were these knights—with their history, identity, interests, obligations, and values—would I even consider this?\"\n\n\nAnswer: Yes, absolutely. These men were specifically selected by their Grand Masters as exceptional candidates. They traveled to Toledo knowing they were being considered for a special royal appointment. Their entire careers demonstrate commitment to exactly this kind of service: Quiroga's fair judgments in Granada, Sotomayor's decade hunting corruption, Castañeda's twenty years alone on the frontier. Juan is offering them a prestigious position that aligns perfectly with their demonstrated values.\n\n\nThe question is not whether they accept, but how—with what enthusiasm, what reservations, what questions about terms.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Evaluate Juan's Approach\n\n\nStrengths:\n\n\nPowerful religious framing (\"kingdom of heaven here on earth,\" \"the lord's light\")\n\nClear mission statement: protect innocent, shield weak, help faithful\n\nPromises full authority and support for them and their families\n\nQueen Lucia's presence adds royal gravity\n\nAppeals to their identity as servants of God, not just servants of the crown\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n\nSomewhat abstract and poetic—light metaphors but few concrete details\n\n\"No borders, no jurisdiction, no task\" could concern men who value clear authority\n\nDoes not address accountability, reporting, or practical terms\n\nDoes not acknowledge their current obligations to their Orders\n\nPresumes they are needed to bring light—they have been serving already\n\n\n\nStep 4: Identify Factors\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nGrand Masters nominated them specifically for this role\n\nThey traveled to Toledo expecting this offer\n\nPosition aligns perfectly with their demonstrated life's work\n\nJuan's reputation: Defender of Romania, conqueror of Granada, ruler of five crowns\n\nDirect service to the King—immense prestige\n\nReligious framing matches their identity as knights of holy Orders\n\n\"Full authority\" and \"every support\" are attractive promises\n\nMeaningful work in peacetime when capable men seek purpose\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nSpeech is vague on practical terms and accountability\n\nLeaving (or being seconded from) their Orders may raise questions\n\n\"No jurisdiction\" could mean \"no clear authority\" in practice—how does this work?\n\nExperienced men may want concrete answers before committing\n\nMinor: the \"darkness\" metaphor slightly presumes their previous service was insufficient\n\n\n\nStep 5: Factor Balance\n\n\nSuccess factors heavily outweigh failure factors. Acceptance is nearly certain. The roll determines:\n\n\nDo they accept with passionate devotion or sober professionalism?\n\nDo they raise practical concerns or simply kneel in acceptance?\n\nWhat tone does this set for their future service?\n\n\n\nd100 Table: The Knights' Response\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nRespectful Acceptance with Significant Reservations. They accept—they came here to accept—but Sotomayor, the investigator, speaks carefully. He has questions: To whom do they report? What are the limits of \"no jurisdiction\"? How do they avoid being seen as the King's secret inquisitors rather than servants of justice? The acceptance is real, but they want answers before they ride out. Juan must address their concerns to secure wholehearted service.\n11-25\nProfessional Acceptance. All three kneel and accept the charge. Their response is proper, formal, correct—but measured. They are experienced men who have heard grand speeches before. Quiroga, the eldest, speaks for them: they are honored, they accept, they will serve faithfully. But the passion in Juan's words does not quite ignite an equal passion in return. These are professionals accepting a worthy assignment, not converts embracing a vision.\n26-50\nSolid, Genuine Acceptance. The knights accept with evident sincerity. Castañeda, the frontier watcher, responds that he has spent twenty years carrying the Crown's eyes to lonely places—he is ready to carry its justice as well. The others echo his commitment. They have a few practical questions about coordination and resources, but these are the questions of men preparing to do good work, not men looking for escape clauses.\n51-75\nMoved Acceptance. Juan's words have touched something in them. Quiroga speaks of the settlers in Granada who had no one to turn to until he came—this is the same work, expanded to a kingdom. Sotomayor says quietly that he has seen what happens when corruption goes unchallenged; he accepts gladly. Castañeda simply kneels again, deeper than before, and says he has waited his whole life to serve a king who understood what the frontier teaches about justice. They are his.\n76-90\nFervent Acceptance. The religious framing has struck home. These are knights of holy Orders—men who took vows to serve God through arms. Quiroga's voice thickens as he responds: \"Your Majesty speaks of light and darkness. I have seen both. I have held a breach while men died around me, and I have watched a widow receive justice she never expected. Both were service to God. If you would send me into darkness with His light—\" He cannot finish. The others need no words. They kneel in the silence of men who have found their purpose confirmed.\n91-100\nTranscendent Moment. Something shifts in the hall. Perhaps it is the afternoon light, or the presence of the Queen, or simply the right words meeting the right men at the right moment. All three knights kneel, and Sotomayor—the quiet one, the watcher, the man who spent eight months asking questions—speaks first. \"I joined Calatrava because I believed justice was holy work. I spent ten years learning that belief is not enough—that justice requires men willing to walk into places where no one wants them and ask questions no one wants answered.\" He looks up. \"Your Majesty has just described my soul's work and offered me a kingdom to do it in. I accept, and I will make you proud of your choice.\" The others speak in turn, each testimony building on the last. When they finish, even Álvaro de Luna is silent.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

I need to narrate this powerful moment where the knights accept with genuine religious fervor, moved by Juan's words about light and darkness and serving God through righteous action.\n\nLet me write a scene that captures this emotional moment without going overboard - these are experienced, mature men, not excitable youths. Their fervor should be dignified and profound, not theatrical.\n\n\nThe hall falls silent after Juan's words fade.\n\n\nFor a long moment, the three knights remain standing, and something passes between them—a glance, a recognition. These are men who have spent their lives in service, who have bled and watched others bleed, who have made hard choices in lonely places. They know the weight of what is being offered.\n\n\nIt is Fray Gonzalo de Quiroga who moves first. The old Santiago knight lowers himself to one knee, more slowly than protocol demands, with the deliberateness of a man for whom the gesture carries genuine meaning.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of light and darkness.\" His voice is rough, the voice of a man who once held a breach for six hours. \"I have seen both. I have held dying men in my arms and told them their sacrifice meant something.

The sword and the judgment seat. I never thought to hear a king speak of them as one thing.\" He looks up, and his eyes are bright. \"If Your Majesty would send me into darkness carrying His light—then I am yours. Not because you are my king, though you are. Because you have described the work I was born to do, and offered me a kingdom in which to do it.\"\n\n\nFray Martín de Sotomayor kneels beside him. The investigator's watchful eyes have lost their careful neutrality. \"I have spent ten years asking questions that powerful men did not want answered. I have seen what happens when corruption festers in darkness—how it rots everything it touches, how the innocent suffer while the guilty prosper.\" His voice is quiet but intense. \"Your Majesty offers me the authority to carry that work beyond Calatrava's walls, to every corner of the realm. I accept. And I swear before God and the Queen that I will be worthy of the trust.\"\n\n\nFray Diego de Castañeda, the eldest, kneels last. The frontier watcher speaks simply, as a man comfortable with solitude speaks—without ornament, without performance.\n\n\n\"Twenty years on the border, Your Majesty. Alone, mostly. Watching. Listening. Carrying warnings to men who did not always wish to hear them.\" A ghost of a smile crosses his weathered face. \"I learned that justice does not announce itself with trumpets. It walks quietly into places where no one expects it, and it remembers the people that everyone else has forgotten.\"\n\n\nHe bows his head.\n\n\n\"You have described my life's work and given it a name. I accept, and I will carry your light to every dark corner of your realms until God calls me home.\"\n\n\nQueen Lucia stands motionless at your side. Even Álvaro de Luna, who has seen much in his years of service, watches in silence.\n\n\nThe three knights remain kneeling, awaiting your word."

Fray Gonzalo de Quiroga (Santiago) - experienced in Granada, known for fair judgments, speaks Arabic. He might focus on the newly conquered territories or areas where settlers and locals clash.\n\n2. Fray Martín de Sotomayor (Calatrava) - the investigator, patient, rooted out corruption within his own Order. He might focus on investigating corruption, following up on patterns in the marshall reports, looking at systemic problems.\n\n3.

Granada.\" He strokes his grey beard. \"The conquest is seven years past, but the wounds are not healed. I know those lands—I spent three years settling disputes between settlers and converts.

Then I would follow them, quietly, until I understood what I was seeing. Only then would I act.\"\n\n\nFray Diego de Castañeda, the frontier watcher, shrugs with the economy of a man who has spent more time with horses than with people.\n\n\n\"The north. Galicia. Asturias. The mountain valleys where the roads end.\" His voice is unhurried. \"Don Pedro Álvarez de Osorio—your marshall there—spoke of dangerous roads and accidents that happen to travelers who ask questions. I would like to walk those roads. Ask those questions.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes directly.\n\n\n\"The great lords, the cities, the places where power gathers—others will watch them. I am suited for the places no one watches. The villages that see a royal official once in a generation.

But first, travel to Florence by sea\n\nI should acknowledge these plans and ask about the Florence trip - what is the purpose? This seems like a significant undertaking that needs more detail. I shouldn't assume why Juan wants to go to Florence.\n\nLet me respond appropriately - Álvaro would likely have questions about this sudden announcement of a Florence trip.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna's stylus stops mid-stroke.

Let me search the project files for information about Basel and the reforms that have been passed.\n\nI need to search for Basel-related documents and understand the context. The Council of Basel was a major church council that dealt with reform and had conflicts with Pope Eugenius IV.\n\nLet me search the project knowledge for Basel information.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process\n\nLet me search for more recent information about Basel - what has happened in the years between 1433 and 1439.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Synthesized historical conflict and crafted probabilistic outcome framework.\n\nThe user is asking about what has happened at the Council of Basel between 1433 and 1439. From the project files, I can see that:\n\n1. In 1433, Basel passed several major reform decrees (Sessions 12, 15, 16, 17, 19) covering electoral reform, clerical concubinage, pluralism, annates, and the crusade decree\n2. The Compacts of Basel were signed with Bohemia in November 1433, ending the Hussite Wars\n3. The Declaration of Como was signed between Juan and Emperor Sigismund\n4. Juan visited Rome and Pope Eugenius IV in 1434\n\nHowever, I need to determine what has happened at Basel between 1434 and 1439 - this is a significant period historically. In real history, there was an escalating conflict between Pope Eugenius IV and the Council of Basel, eventually leading to the Council declaring Eugenius deposed and electing an antipope (Felix V) in 1439.\n\nSince this is an alternate timeline where Juan has been promoting \"parallel legislation\" and reconciliation between Pope and Council, I should create a d100 table to determine how successful this approach has been over the past 5 years.\n\nLet me draft a table that accounts for:\n- The historical tendency toward escalating conflict\n- Juan's efforts at mediation through the Como Declaration and parallel legislation\n- The ongoing reform decrees\n- The potential for schism or reconciliation\n- The Bohemian situation (Compacts)\n- The Greek question (union with Eastern Church was being discussed at this time)\n\nIn real history:\n- 1434: Pope Eugenius fled Rome due to a revolt, relocated to Florence\n- 1435-1437: Escalating tensions; Basel continued passing decrees\n- 1437: Pope transferred the Council to Ferrara (for union discussions with Greeks); Basel refused to move\n- 1438: Council of Ferrara-Florence began; Basel declared Eugenius suspended\n\n\n- 1439: Basel declared Eugenius deposed; elected Duke Amadeus of Savoy as antipope Felix V\n\nI'll explore potential outcomes of Juan's diplomatic efforts. The d100 table will reveal whether his parallel legislation and reconciliation strategies have mitigated the historical tensions, potentially preventing the schism or creating a different resolution to the conflict between the Council and the Pope.\n\n\nÁlvaro exchanges a glance with you—the question of Florence and Basel are intertwined, and both touch on the delicate architecture of power Juan has been trying to build since 1433.\n\n\n\"Basel...\" Álvaro says slowly. \"It has been six years since Your Majesty signed the Declaration of Como with Emperor Sigismund. Six years since the reform decrees passed—pluralism, annates, concubinage, the Compacts with Bohemia. Much has happened since then, and not all of it is clear from Toledo.\"\n\n\nHe turns to the door. \"I will have the latest dispatches from our delegation brought. But the situation has been... fluid.\"\n\n\n\nThe State of the Council of Basel, 1439\n\n\nThe Council of Basel has now been sitting for eight years. In 1433, when Juan visited, it was at its zenith—passing sweeping reforms, negotiating peace with the Hussites, launching crusade decrees. The Declaration of Como promised a new era of cooperation between Pope and Council, with parallel legislation healing the constitutional rift.\n\n\nBut history rarely follows such neat paths.\n\n\nWhat the GM must determine: How has the Pope-Council conflict evolved since 1433? Has Juan's \"parallel legislation\" approach held, or has the old enmity reasserted itself?\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nJuan's personal diplomacy in 1433-1434 created genuine goodwill\n\nThe Declaration of Como provided a framework for cooperation\n\nPope Eugenius IV issued parallel reforms as agreed\n\nThe Compacts of Basel ended the Hussite Wars—a shared victory\n\nCardinal Cesarini remained committed to reconciliation\n\nThe Constantinople crusade gave both sides a common cause\n\nJuan's continued involvement (letters, delegations) kept pressure on moderates\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nThe constitutional question (Haec Sancta) was never resolved, only deferred\n\nCardinal Louis Aleman's radical faction never accepted papal authority\n\nFrench delegates consistently pushed for conciliar supremacy\n\nPope Eugenius fled Rome in 1434 during a revolt—weakening his position\n\nThe Greek Church question created new tensions (who negotiates union—Pope or Council?)\n\nDistance and time eroded Juan's personal influence\n\nEmperor Sigismund died in 1437, removing a key moderate voice\n\nInstitutional interests on both sides resist compromise\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nSchism. The worst has happened. Basel declared Eugenius deposed and elected an antipope. Christendom is divided once more—France and some German states recognize the Council's pope; Italy, Castile, and others remain with Eugenius. The parallel legislation framework has collapsed entirely. Juan's efforts delayed the rupture but could not prevent it.\n11-25\nNear-Schism. Basel has declared Eugenius suspended but stopped short of deposing him. An ultimatum hangs in the air. The radical faction dominates the Council; moderates like Cesarini have withdrawn in despair. One more provocation could trigger full schism. The parallel legislation is dead in practice, though neither side admits it.\n26-40\nCold War. Pope and Council exist in hostile stalemate. Basel continues to pass decrees; Eugenius ignores them. Each claims authority; neither can enforce it. The reforms of 1433 remain technically in effect but unevenly observed. Juan's framework survives in letter but not in spirit. The Greek union negotiations have become a new battleground—both sides claim the right to negotiate with Constantinople.\n41-55\nFragile Peace. The parallel legislation framework still holds, but barely. Eugenius has matched most Basel decrees with papal versions; Basel has refrained from direct attacks on papal authority. But tensions simmer beneath the surface. Emperor Sigismund's death in 1437 removed a key mediator. The Greek question is being handled awkwardly—a joint delegation, neither side satisfied. One crisis could shatter everything.\n56-70\nStable Tension. The Como framework has proven more durable than anyone expected. Pope and Council maintain an uneasy cooperation—parallel reforms, shared credit, careful avoidance of constitutional questions. Moderates on both sides credit Juan's intervention. The Greek negotiations are proceeding under papal leadership with Council observers—an awkward compromise that nonetheless works. Reform continues, slowly.\n71-85\nGenuine Progress. The parallel legislation approach has become normalized. Eugenius and Basel have found a working relationship—not warm, but functional. Major reforms have been implemented across Christendom. The Greek negotiations are advancing toward union. Cardinal Cesarini remains at Basel as a bridge between factions. Juan is credited as a key architect of this fragile peace.\n86-95\nUnexpected Success. The reforms of 1433-1434 have taken root. Pope Eugenius, initially reluctant, has embraced reform as his legacy. Basel's radical faction has been marginalized as moderates point to real accomplishments. The Greek Church is actively negotiating union, with a council planned for Italy. The constitutional question remains unresolved, but increasingly irrelevant—cooperation has replaced confrontation.\n96-100\nTransformation. Something remarkable has occurred. Whether through Cesarini's diplomacy, Eugenius's conversion, or the sheer weight of accomplished reform, the Pope-Council conflict has given way to genuine partnership. A new council—perhaps at Florence or Ferrara—is being planned to formalize Greek union and consolidate reforms. The parallel legislation model Juan championed in 1433 is now the accepted norm. Church historians will debate for centuries whether this was inevitable or miraculous.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

      "say": "Thought process: Reconciled practical achievements with theological complexities.\n\nThe user makes an excellent point. In this alternate timeline, Juan has done something extraordinary - he's actually defended Constantinople, stopped the Ottoman advance, established a Latin settlement with Greek cooperation, and is actively rebuilding the city. The \"Greek question\" in the historical timeline was about Church union negotiations - who would negotiate with the Byzantine Emperor about reunifying the Eastern and Western churches.\n\nBut in this timeline, Juan has essentially bypassed that question through action rather than theology. He's the \"Defensor Romaniae,\" he's got Latin settlers living alongside Greeks under the Apokatastasis agreement, he's funding the city's reconstruction, and he's preparing for war against the Ottomans.\n\nSo the user is right to push back - the \"Greek question\" as it existed historically (theological union negotiations) may have been transformed or made less urgent by Juan's practical actions. The Greeks might care less about theological fine points when a Catholic king is actually defending their walls and feeding their people.\n\nLet me think about how this would play out:\n\n1. In the historical timeline, the Council of Basel and Pope Eugenius competed to host negotiations with the Greek Church for reunion. This was a prestige matter - whoever brought the Greeks back into communion would have a major victory.\n\n2. In this alternate timeline, Juan has created facts on the ground. The Apokatastasis allows Latin settlement and worship in Constantinople. There's a joint treasury. Latin knights defend the walls. The Emperor has accepted Juan as \"Defensor Romaniae.\"\n\n3. However, formal theological union - the filioque question, papal primacy, etc. - has NOT been resolved. The Greeks and Latins still have their theological differences. What Juan has done is create practical cooperation without resolving the theological schism.\n\n4. So the \"Greek question\" in this timeline might be different - not \"who negotiates union\" but \"is union even necessary anymore given practical cooperation?\" Or perhaps \"how do we formalize what Juan has already achieved?\"\n\n5. The Pope and Council might both be trying to claim credit for or control over what Juan accomplished. Or they might be arguing about whether Juan's practical arrangement is sufficient or whether formal theological union is still needed.\n\n\nI'll frame the response to highlight the nuanced transformation of the \"Greek question\" in this unique historical scenario. By emphasizing practical cooperation over theological debates, Juan has fundamentally altered the diplomatic landscape, creating a new paradigm of inter-church relations that challenges traditional negotiation frameworks.\n\n\nÁlvaro pauses, and a wry smile crosses his face.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty raises an excellent point. And I confess I spoke loosely.\"\n\n\nHe settles back into his chair, choosing his words with care.\n\n\n\"In the standard course of Church politics, the 'Greek question' would mean: who negotiates theological union with Constantinople? The filioque, papal primacy, the procession of the Holy Spirit—the matters that divided East and West in 1054. Pope and Council have quarreled for years over who has authority to treat with the Greeks on these questions.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"But Your Majesty has... rendered much of that debate irrelevant. You did not negotiate theological union. You defended Constantinople. You established the Apokatastasis. You created the joint treasury, settled Latin families alongside Greek, and are now preparing a crusade to push back the Ottomans. Emperor John VIII calls you Defensor Romaniae. The Patriarch serves communion to Latin knights who guard his walls.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's smile deepens, though there is something complicated in it.\n\n\n\"The theologians in Basel and Rome still argue about the filioque. Meanwhile, Latin and Greek Christians pray in the same city, defend the same walls, and share the same bread—if not quite the same chalice. Your Majesty has achieved through action what centuries of councils failed to achieve through debate.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"This is... not entirely comfortable for either Pope or Council. Both wished to claim credit for reuniting Christendom. Instead, a Castilian king simply did it, without waiting for their permission or their theological formulas. Some at Basel mutter that Your Majesty has overstepped—that practical cooperation without formal union is a half-measure, or worse, a precedent that laymen can solve what only councils should address. Some in Rome worry that Your Majesty's influence in Constantinople rivals the Pope's own claim to universal jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"The Greek question, in this timeline, is not 'who negotiates union.' It is 'what do we do about Juan of Castile, who has made our negotiations seem... beside the point?'\"\n\n\nQueen Lucia, who has been listening quietly, speaks up. \"They should thank you. Instead, they resent you.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro inclines his head. \"Such is the nature of institutions, Your Grace. A problem solved by someone outside the institution is almost worse than a problem unsolved. It raises uncomfortable questions about why the institution exists.\""

Based on the roll of 50 (Fragile Peace), the parallel legislation framework still holds but barely. The user wants to know what matters are still being discussed at Basel and whether they're close to dissolving.\n\nLet me think about what would historically be happening at Basel around 1439, and how the alternate timeline might have modified this.\n\nHistorically:\n- By 1439, Basel was in open conflict with Pope Eugenius IV\n- The Council had declared Eugenius suspended in 1438\n- In 1439, they would depose him and elect Felix V as antipope\n- The Council continued until 1449 but with diminishing relevance\n\nIn this alternate timeline (roll 50 - Fragile Peace):\n- The parallel legislation framework still holds, but barely\n- Eugenius has matched most Basel decrees with papal versions\n- Basel has refrained from direct attacks on papal authority\n- But tensions simmer beneath the surface\n- Emperor Sigismund's death in 1437 removed a key mediator\n\nSo in this timeline, Basel hasn't gone into full schism, but it's fragile. They would still be discussing:\n1. Remaining reform matters\n2. The constitutional question (though deferred)\n3. The Greek union question (though Juan has made this somewhat moot)\n4. Enforcement of existing reforms\n5. Whether/when to dissolve\n\nThe Council has been sitting for 8 years now (since 1431). That's a long time. In historical terms, councils typically had specific purposes and dissolved when those were achieved. Basel's ongoing nature is unusual and draining.\n\nLet me have Álvaro explain this, perhaps with some uncertainty since Toledo doesn't have perfect information about Basel's internal debates.\n\n\nÁlvaro sighs—the sigh of a man who has read too many dispatches from ecclesiastical assemblies.\n\n\n\"Dissolving themselves? No, Your Majesty. Councils do not dissolve themselves willingly. They are like courts—once established, they find reasons to persist.\" He reaches for a sheaf of papers that a servant has brought in. \"Our delegation sends regular reports, though I confess the details blur together after eight years.\"\n\n\nHe scans the documents.\n\n\n\"The great reforms were passed in 1433—pluralism, concubinage, annates, the electoral procedures. The Compacts ended the Hussite Wars. The crusade decree launched Your Majesty's expedition. By rights, the Council should have declared victory and gone home.\"\n\n\nHe sets down the papers.\n\n\n\"But the constitutional question was never resolved. Haec Sancta still hangs over everything—does the Council stand above the Pope, or the Pope above the Council? Neither side will yield. Neither side will let the other claim victory by departing first.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro ticks off points on his fingers.\n\n\n\"What remains on Basel's agenda? First, enforcement of existing reforms. The decrees were passed, but implementation varies wildly. French bishops enforce some provisions; German bishops ignore others; Italian bishops wait to see which way the wind blows. Basel keeps issuing clarifications, extensions, exceptions.\"\n\n\nA second finger.\n\n\n\"Second, new reforms that were deferred. Monastic discipline—the state of the religious houses. Clerical education—standards for ordination. Indulgences—\" He pauses. \"There is growing concern about the sale of indulgences, though no decree has passed. Each of these matters could occupy the Council for another year.\"\n\n\nA third finger.\n\n\n\"Third, and most poisonous—the question of where to hold a council for Greek union. Pope Eugenius wants it in Italy, under his control. Basel's radicals want it at Basel or Avignon, under Council control. Your Majesty's actions in Constantinople have made this somewhat academic, but neither side will admit that. They argue about a union council while Your Majesty's knights already stand on Byzantine walls.\"\n\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\n\"Cardinal Cesarini has tried repeatedly to bring the Council to a graceful close. He proposed declaring the reform work complete and scheduling a future council per Frequens—letting everyone go home with honor. But Cardinal Aleman's faction blocked it. They will not leave Basel until they have either subordinated the Pope or been forcibly dissolved.\"\n\n\nQueen Lucia frowns. \"Can the Pope not simply order them to disperse?\"\n\n\n\"He tried, Your Grace. In 1433, before Your Majesty's intervention. They ignored him and cited Haec Sancta—that councils cannot be dissolved without their own consent. The parallel legislation framework Your Majesty championed at Como created a truce, but it did not resolve the underlying dispute.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro looks at you directly.\n\n\n\"The honest truth, Your Majesty? Basel continues because no one knows how to end it. The moderates lack the votes to dissolve. The radicals lack the courage to depose the Pope—especially after Your Majesty made clear in 1433 that Castile would not recognize a schism. And Eugenius lacks the power to compel obedience. So they sit. They debate. They pass minor decrees. They wait for something to change.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"Your journey to Florence may be that something. If the Medici bank becomes the instrument of imperial finance, if Castilian gold flows through Florentine hands rather than Roman ones, if Your Majesty builds an economic architecture that bypasses both Pope and Council...\" He trails off. \"That would concentrate minds wonderfully.

Governors for each realm (Castile, Granada, Aragon, Valencia, Naples, Sicily, Constantinople)\n2. The Council of Realms - a permanent advisory council in Toledo with representatives from all five kingdoms, elected by each realm's Cortes for five-year terms\n\nLet me search for more context about these systems from the project files.\n\nFrom Chapter 2.52 Summary, I can see:\n- Council of Realms: Permanent advisory council in Toledo with representatives from all five kingdoms. Five-year terms. Representatives elected by each realm's Cortes. Advisory only - no veto, no votes. Crown retains all authority.\n- Crown Marshalls: Permanent royal representative in each realm\n\nFrom Chapter 2.46 Summary:\n- Governor appointments were made:\n  - Castile: King Juan II (serves as governor; administrator works behind scenes)\n  - Granada: Don García López de Padilla (confirmed in existing position)\n  - Aragon: Guillem de Santcliment (Valencian merchant; unprecedented appointment; title: Procurador Real)\n  - Naples: Marino Brancaccio (Lesser Neapolitan baron)\n  - Constantinople: Military Commander (liaison) with Sphrantzes continuing treasury\n\nSo the governors were appointed in Chapter 2.46 (January 1438). Now it's Spring 1439 - about 15-16 months later. The question is: how well has this system been implemented? Have the Cortes in each realm elected representatives to the Council of Realms?\n\nLet me create a d100 table for this.\n\nSuccess Factors:\n- Juan's prestige is at its height\n- The system was carefully designed with clear authority structures\n- Governors were appointed over a year ago - time to settle in\n- The Council of Realms is advisory only - no threat to local autonomy\n- Juan has visited and built relationships in most territories\n\n\n- Economic prosperity creates a compelling incentive for collaboration, making cooperation more likely\n- The previous imperial muster demonstrated effective cross-territorial coordination, suggesting potential for successful implementation\n\nChallenges emerge from the diverse political landscapes. Each realm brings unique institutional traditions, with Aragon's strong fueros and Naples' recent conquest complicating potential integration. Local elites might resist sending top representatives to Toledo, potentially undermining the council's effectiveness. Language barriers and distinct regional identities further complicate the governance model's smooth implementation.\n\nTravel logistics pose additional practical obstacles. Representatives must navigate significant distances and bear substantial travel expenses, which could limit participation and commitment. While the foundational conditions seem promising, the system will likely experience partial adoption with notable regional variations.\n\n\nImplementation of Imperial Governance Systems\n\n\nÁlvaro nods, pleased at the pivot to practical matters.\n\n\n\"The governors were appointed in January of last year, Your Majesty. Fifteen months now. And the Council of Realms charter was drafted and sent to each realm's Cortes with instructions to elect representatives for five-year terms.\"\n\n\nHe frowns slightly.\n\n\n\"I have received correspondence from each territory, but I confess the reports have been... uneven.

Five-year terms. Advisory capacity only—no veto, no votes. The representatives would provide the Crown with perspective from their territories and carry information back home.\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nJuan's prestige after Constantinople, Naples, and the muster is immense\n\nThe Council of Realms is explicitly advisory—no threat to local privileges\n\nThe 1437 muster (Roll 95) demonstrated extraordinary imperial cooperation\n\nGovernors have had fifteen months to establish themselves\n\nEconomic prosperity makes cooperation attractive\n\nClear charter with defined roles prevents ambiguity\n\nLatin as administrative language was already accepted\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nAragón's fueros create strong institutional resistance to anything resembling centralization\n\nNaples is newly integrated and still learning Castilian administrative expectations\n\nSicily has its own traditions, separate even from Naples\n\nConstantinople is distant and preoccupied with immediate survival\n\nEach Cortes has its own politics—elections can be contentious or delayed\n\nRepresentatives must relocate to Toledo for years—a significant personal sacrifice\n\nSome realms may send token figures rather than men of real weight\n\nLanguage and cultural barriers persist despite Latin administration\n\nLocal elites may prefer keeping their best people at home\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nSystematic Failure. The governors are in place but struggling. Aragón's Cortes has refused to elect a representative, citing fuero violations. Naples sent a representative who returned home after three months, claiming illness. Sicily never responded to the request. Constantinople's representative died en route. Only Granada's representative sits in Toledo—and he has no one to advise alongside. The system exists on paper only.\n11-25\nPartial Collapse. Castile and Granada have functioning representatives. Aragón elected someone, but he is a minor figure sent to satisfy the letter of the requirement while insulting its spirit. Naples and Sicily are embroiled in a dispute over whether to send separate representatives or one shared delegate. Constantinople has not responded—Sphrantzes claims the city cannot spare anyone of sufficient stature. The Council of Realms meets, but half the chairs are empty.\n26-40\nUneven Implementation. Three of five realms have seated representatives: Castile (a respected bishop), Granada (Don García's chosen liaison), and surprisingly Naples (an ambitious young baron seeking royal favor). Aragón's Cortes is still \"deliberating\"—code for obstruction by nobles who resent Guillem de Santcliment's appointment. Sicily claims its representative is \"en route\" but has been for six months. Constantinople sent a Greek scholar who speaks no Castilian and struggles to participate meaningfully.\n41-55\nFunctional but Fragile. All five realms have technically seated representatives, though the quality varies. Castile and Granada sent capable men. Aragón sent a compromise candidate—acceptable to no faction, offensive to none, influential with nobody. Naples's representative is competent but spends half his time managing family business via courier. Sicily's delegate is elderly and frequently ill. Constantinople's representative is earnest but overwhelmed by the scale of Western politics. The Council meets monthly; discussions are productive but lack weight.\n56-70\nSolid Foundation. The system is working better than skeptics predicted. Four of five representatives are men of genuine standing who take their roles seriously. Castile sent a senior letrado; Granada a trusted administrator; Naples a baron with real influence; Constantinople a Greek merchant who has proven surprisingly adept at bridging cultures. Only Aragón disappoints—their representative is capable but clearly instructed to observe rather than participate. The Council has begun providing genuinely useful advice on cross-realm matters.\n71-85\nStrong Implementation. All five representatives have arrived and engaged meaningfully. The Aragonese Cortes, after initial resistance, sent the Justicia's nephew—a signal that they take the institution seriously even if they distrust it. Naples and Sicily coordinated to send complementary figures who work well together. Constantinople's representative—a Latin-educated Greek bishop—has become an eloquent voice for Eastern perspectives. The Council of Realms is developing its own procedures and traditions. Álvaro reports that their advice has already influenced two minor policy decisions.\n86-95\nExceeding Expectations. The Council of Realms has become a genuine institution. Representatives compete for the honor of appointment; each realm sent distinguished figures. Cross-realm relationships are forming—the Aragonese and Neapolitan delegates have become unlikely friends. The Council has begun producing written recommendations that circulate among advisors. Governors report that knowing \"their\" representative sits with the King has improved cooperation. The system Juan envisioned is taking root faster than anyone anticipated.\n96-100\nTransformative Success. Something remarkable has emerged. The Council of Realms has become not merely advisory but actively influential—a space where the empire's diversity becomes a strength rather than a challenge. Representatives have begun meeting informally, solving minor inter-realm disputes before they reach the Crown. The Aragonese representative, initially suspicious, has become the Council's most passionate defender, arguing in letters home that this is how fueros should work—local voice in imperial decisions. Other kingdoms are watching with interest. Ambassadors ask about \"the Castilian model.\"\n\n\nRoll when ready."

      "say": "Thought process: Envisioned thriving institutional governance across interconnected realms.\n\nThe player rolled 92, which falls in the 86-95 range: \"Exceeding Expectations.\"\n\nThis is excellent news for Juan's imperial governance system. The Council of Realms has become a genuine institution with distinguished representatives from all five realms. Cross-realm relationships are forming, the Council is producing written recommendations, and governors report improved cooperation.\n\nLet me narrate this outcome in a way that brings it to life, showing the specific representatives and how the system is working.\n\n\nÁlvaro permits himself a rare smile—the smile of an administrator whose careful work has borne fruit.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am pleased to report that the Council of Realms has exceeded my most optimistic expectations.\"\n\n\nHe rises and moves to a side table where several leather folios are stacked. He brings them back, spreading them before you.\n\n\n\"All five representatives arrived in Toledo by autumn of last year. And not token figures sent to satisfy a requirement—these are men of genuine weight, sent because their Cortes recognized the opportunity.\"\n\n\nHe opens the first folio.\n\n\n\nThe Council of Realms — Current Representatives\n\n\nCastile: Don Alonso Pérez de Vivero\nRoyal accountant and senior letrado, fifty-three years old. Served in the treasury under Diego de Daza before his appointment. Knows every maravedí that flows through the kingdom. The Castilian Cortes chose him because he understands both the Crown's needs and the realm's capacity. Practical, detail-oriented, respected by nobles and commons alike.\n\n\nGranada: Don Rodrigo de Bobadilla\nYounger son of a family that distinguished itself in the conquest. Thirty-one years old. Fluent in Arabic, experienced in mediating between Old Christian settlers and Morisco converts. Don García López de Padilla personally recommended him. Brings the perspective of a frontier realm still finding its identity within the Crown.\n\n\nAragón: Don Martín de Gurrea\nNephew of the Justicia of Aragón. This appointment raised eyebrows—the Justicia's office is supposed to be independent of royal influence. But the Cortes chose him precisely because of that connection, signaling that Aragón takes the Council seriously even while remaining vigilant about fueros. Forty years old, trained in law, meticulous about proper procedure. Initially suspicious, he has become one of the Council's most engaged members.\n\n\nNaples: Count Giacomo Carafa\nA baron of the middle nobility—wealthy enough to matter, not so powerful as to threaten. Forty-five years old. Supported Alfonso V's claim and was rewarded with royal favor. Speaks passable Castilian learned during Alfonso's campaigns. Ambitious, shrewd, and determined to ensure Naples is not forgotten in Toledo's calculations. Has formed an unlikely friendship with Don Martín of Aragón—they argue constantly and dine together weekly.\n\n\nConstantinople: Bishop Theodoros Metochites\nA Greek bishop educated in both Orthodox and Latin theology—one of the few men alive who can navigate both traditions with genuine understanding. Fifty-eight years old. Survived three sieges. Volunteered for the position when Sphrantzes asked who might serve. His presence in Toledo is itself a statement: the East is not merely a supplicant but a partner. His Latin is elegant, his perspective invaluable, his quiet dignity has won respect even from those who initially viewed a Greek churchman with suspicion.\n\n\n\nÁlvaro closes the folio.\n\n\n\"They meet twice monthly in a chamber I have assigned in the Alcázar's east wing. I attend when invited, which is often. They have developed their own procedures—rotating chairmanship, written agenda distributed in advance, formal minutes kept in Latin.\"\n\n\nHe picks up another document.\n\n\n\"More importantly, they have begun producing recommendations. Here—\" He hands you a parchment. \"Last month's advice on standardizing weights and measures across the realms. They identified seventeen different standards currently in use and proposed a five-year harmonization schedule. It is... remarkably detailed. Count Carafa and Don Alonso drafted it together.\"\n\n\nQueen Lucia leans forward with interest. \"They cooperate? Truly?\"\n\n\n\"They argue fiercely, Your Grace. Don Martín and Count Carafa nearly came to blows over precedence in the first month. But they argue about substance, not faction. And when they reach agreement, it carries weight precisely because it represents genuine consensus across the empire.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's expression grows thoughtful.\n\n\n\"The governors have noticed the difference. Guillem de Santcliment in Aragón writes that knowing Don Martín sits with Your Majesty has smoothed relations with the local nobility. They feel heard, even when they disagree with decisions. Marino Brancaccio in Naples says Count Carafa's letters home have done more to reconcile Neapolitan lords to Castilian rule than any decree.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"Bishop Theodoros has become something of a celebrity among the Toledo clergy. They invite him to preach—in Latin, of course. His homilies on the unity of Christendom draw considerable crowds. I am told the Archbishop of Toledo attended last Easter and wept.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro gathers the documents.\n\n\n\"The system Your Majesty envisioned is taking root. It is not perfect—there are still tensions, still suspicions, still moments when one representative or another threatens to return home in protest. But it works. The empire has a voice that is not merely the Crown speaking to itself.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"Other kingdoms are watching, Your Majesty. The Venetian ambassador asked me last month about 'the Castilian model.' I told him nothing, of course. But he asked.\""

Constantinople\n\nWait, but in the summary I provided, I listed five representatives for five realms. Let me check what the original governance structure was.\n\nFrom Chapter 2.46 Summary:\n- Castile: King Juan II (direct rule)\n- Granada: Don García López de Padilla\n- Aragon: Guillem de Santcliment\n- Naples: Marino Brancaccio\n- Constantinople: Military Commander (liaison)\n\nAnd Sicily was mentioned as separate from Naples. So the five territories with governors were Castile, Granada, Aragon, Naples, and Constantinople.\n\nBut wait, the user is saying Granada has no representative but Sicily does. Let me re-read.\n\nLooking at the Madrid Imperial Capital Plan document from Chapter 2.52:\n\"The Council of Realms Chamber: Adjacent to the throne room... A round chamber with domed ceiling, embodying the principle of equality among the five realms. Five great windows face the cardinal directions and the heavens, representing Castile, Aragon, Naples, Sicily, and Constantinople united under God.\"\n\nSo the five realms are: Castile, Aragon, Naples, Sicily, and Constantinople. Granada is part of Castile's crown, not a separate realm!\n\nThis makes sense - Granada was conquered and integrated into Castile. It's not a separate crown in the same way that Aragon, Naples, and Sicily are. The governor in Granada is more like a regional administrator within Castile, not the governor of a separate realm.\n\nSo I need to fix my response. The Council of Realms has representatives from:\n1. Castile\n2. Aragon\n3. Naples\n4. Sicily\n5. Constantinople\n\nNot Granada. Let me correct this.\n\n\nYou are correct, Your Majesty. Granada is part of the Crown of Castile, not a separate realm. The five realms represented on the Council are Castile, Aragón, Naples, Sicily, and Constantinople.\n\n\n\nÁlvaro corrects himself, shuffling the folios.\n\n\n\"Forgive me—I misspoke. Granada is governed by Don García López de Padilla, yes, but as a territory of Castile, not as a separate crown. The Council of Realms represents the five crowns united under Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nHe replaces one document with another.\n\n\n\nThe Council of Realms — Current Representatives (Corrected)\n\n\nCastile: Don Alonso Pérez de Vivero — Senior letrado and royal accountant.\n\n\nAragón: Don Martín de Gurrea — Nephew of the Justicia, trained in law.\n\n\nNaples: Count Giacomo Carafa — Baron of the middle nobility, Alfonso's supporter.\n\n\nSicily: Don Berenguer de Requesens — A Catalan-Sicilian nobleman whose family has held lands on the island for three generations. Forty years old. Speaks Castilian, Catalan, and Sicilian Italian with equal fluency. The Sicilian parliament chose him because he bridges the island's Aragonese heritage with its distinct identity. Quietly effective, he often mediates between Count Carafa's Neapolitan ambitions and Don Martín's Aragonese legalism.\n\n\nConstantinople: Bishop Theodoros Metochites — Greek bishop educated in both Orthodox and Latin theology.\n\n\n\n\"Sicily and Naples were careful to send separate representatives,\" Álvaro adds. \"They may share a king in Alfonso, but they have no intention of sharing a voice. Don Berenguer and Count Carafa are cordial but watchful of each other—neither wishes their island's interests subordinated to the other's.\""

This was discussed in the previous chapter summary - the Iota coinage was approved, with Juan's symbol (the Greek letter Iota with three horizontal stripes) to be minted at Granada. The coin would be the same weight as the Florentine florin.\n\nLet me narrate the summoning of artists and the design process. This is a practical matter - Juan is moving forward with the symbolic representation of his empire through currency.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods and makes a note. \"The mint at Granada already produces excellent work—the masters there struck the commemorative coins for the conquest. But for something of this significance...\"\n\n\nHe considers.\n\n\n\"We should bring together several talents. The die-cutters at Granada for the technical work, certainly. But for the design itself—the image that will circulate throughout five realms and beyond—we might look to the artists Your Majesty has already gathered through the Great Patronage Program.\"\n\n\nHe turns to a servant. \"Send word to Maestro Giorgio di Montepulciano—he is already working on the Madrid designs and understands the Iota symbolism. Also summon the master die-cutter from Granada, and inquire whether any of the Italian goldsmiths in Toledo have experience with medallic art.\"\n\n\nThe servant departs.\n\n\n\nThree Days Later\n\n\nEarly May 1439, Morning\n\n\nThe solar has been arranged for the consultation. A large table stands in the center, covered with parchment, samples of existing coins from across Europe, and several wax tablets for sketching.\n\n\nThree men await you:\n\n\nMaestro Giorgio di Montepulciano — The Florentine architect, perhaps thirty-five, already familiar from the Madrid planning sessions. He has brought his own sketches, unable to resist beginning work before being formally asked. His eyes gleam with the particular excitement of an artist given a commission that will outlast cathedrals.\n\n\nMaestro Hernán de Córdoba — The chief die-cutter from the Granada mint, a man of perhaps fifty with powerful hands and squinting eyes accustomed to detailed work. He carries a leather case containing samples of his craft—existing Castilian coins, experimental strikes, and the tools of his trade. He is not an artist in the Florentine sense, but he knows what can and cannot be rendered in metal at the size of a coin.\n\n\nMaestro Vittorio Gambello — A Venetian goldsmith who came to Toledo two years ago through the Patronage Program. Forty years old, trained in the tradition of Pisanello's portrait medals. He has created commemorative pieces for Italian nobles and understands how to capture a likeness—or a symbol—in miniature relief.\n\n\nQueen Lucia has joined you, curious to see how her husband's imperial vision will be rendered in gold.\n\n\nMaestro Giorgio speaks first, unable to contain himself.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I have taken the liberty of considering the problem. A coin is not merely money—it is a message that passes through thousands of hands. Every baker, every merchant, every beggar who receives it will see what Your Majesty wishes them to see.\"\n\n\nHe unrolls a parchment with several rough sketches.\n\n\n\"The Iota with three horizontal stripes—this is the heart of it, yes? The symbol of unity. But how to render it? And what shall appear on the reverse?\"\n\n\nHe looks up expectantly."

This is a reasonable question about medieval coin-making capabilities.\n\nLet me think about what was possible in the 1430s-1440s for coinage:\n\nMedieval coins did include text - typically around the rim in a circular pattern. Common elements included:\n- The ruler's name and titles\n- Religious phrases (like \"DEI GRATIA\" - by the grace of God)\n- Mint marks\n- Date (less common in this period)\n\nThe Florentine florin, for example, had:\n- Obverse: Lily of Florence with text \"FLORENTIA\"\n- Reverse: John the Baptist with text \"S IOHANNES B\"\n\nSo yes, text was absolutely possible and common. The experts should confirm this and discuss what text might be appropriate.\n\nLet me have the die-cutter and artists respond to Juan's question.\n\n\nMaestro Hernán de Córdoba, the die-cutter, steps forward with a respectful bow.\n\n\n\"Absolutely, Your Majesty. Text is standard practice—indeed, expected. Most coins of quality bear inscriptions around the rim.\" He produces several coins from his leather case, laying them on the table. \"Here—the Florentine florin. See how FLORENTIA circles the lily on one side, and S IOHANNES B surrounds the Baptist on the other.\"\n\n\nHe sets down another coin. \"The Venetian ducat—SIT T XPE DAT Q TV REGIS ISTE DVCAT around the image of Christ. And here, our own Castilian dobla—Your Majesty's name and titles circling the royal arms.\"\n\n\nMaestro Vittorio Gambello nods eagerly. \"The rim inscription is essential, Your Majesty. It serves three purposes: it declares authority, it deters clipping—\" he mimes shaving the edge of a coin \"—and it allows for far more information than the central image alone.\"\n\n\nMaestro Giorgio has already begun sketching.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty proposes the Iota on one face, your portrait on the other. Excellent. The Iota declares the empire; the portrait declares the emperor. But the text...\" He looks up. \"What does Your Majesty wish to proclaim?\"\n\n\nHe gestures to his sketch. \"On the portrait side, tradition would suggest your name and titles: IOANNES DEI GRATIA REX CASTELLAE ARAGONUM NEAPOLIS SICILIAE—but that grows long. We might abbreviate: IOANNES II D G REX CAST ARAG NEAP SIC. Or...\"\n\n\nHe pauses, stylus hovering.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty holds a title no Christian king has held in centuries. Defensor Romaniae. That might appear instead—or as well.\"\n\n\nMaestro Hernán interjects practically. \"The rim can hold perhaps twenty to thirty letters comfortably at florin size, Your Majesty. More if we use standard abbreviations. Less if we want the text clearly legible.\"\n\n\nQueen Lucia, examining the sample coins, speaks up. \"And on the Iota side? What text there?\"\n\n\nMaestro Giorgio's eyes light up. \"That is where we might inscribe the motto, Your Grace. A phrase that captures what the symbol means. UNUM IMPERIUM SUB DEO—One Empire Under God? Or something from Scripture? Or a phrase of Your Majesty's own devising?\"\n\n\nThe three artists look to you expectantly."

Assembly of the Cortes with the agenda items previously discussed\n3. Introduction of the royal family to the nobles\n4. A roll for the reception/first impression when nobles meet Juan and his family\n\nLet me recall the children and their traits from the project files:\n\nFrom Chapter_2_43_Summary.docx:\n- **Princess Catalina (b. January 1432):** Now 7 years old. Survival 73 (survives); Intelligence 87 (brilliant); Temperament 76 (commanding); Special Talent: Voice (legendary singing); Piety 7 (indifferent — spiritually empty); Beauty 70 (beautiful)\n\n- **Prince Fernando (b. August 1433):** Now nearly 6 years old. Survival confirmed; Intelligence 82 (brilliant); Temperament 64 (bold); Martial Aptitude 9 (reluctant — cannot fight); Special Talent 76 (languages); Piety 50 (sincere); Physical Presence 87 (magnificent)\n\n- **Princess Bianca (b. September 1434):** Now nearly 5 years old. Survival 24 (fragile); Intelligence 49 (capable); Temperament 7 (volatile); Special Talent 56 (languages); Piety 71 (devout); Beauty 98 (legendary)\n\n- **Princess Teresa (b. September 1435):** Now about 3.5 years old - probably too young to be involved much\n\n- **Princess Juana (b. Late 1436):** Now about 2.5 years old - too young\n\n- **Prince Nicolás (b. late 1437):** Now about 1.5 years old - too young\n\nSo the older three who would be involved are:\n- Catalina (7): brilliant, commanding, legendary voice, beautiful, but spiritually empty/indifferent\n\n\n- Fernando (6): brilliant, bold, magnificent physical presence, good with languages, but cannot fight\n- Bianca (nearly 5): legendary beauty, volatile temperament, fragile health, devout\n\nI'll analyze the potential reception dynamics. Fernando's linguistic skills and magnificent presence could offset his inability to fight. Bianca's legendary beauty might captivate nobles, despite her volatile nature. Catalina's commanding intelligence and beautiful voice could strategically impress the court. Their collective traits suggest a complex but potentially powerful first impression.\n\nEconomic prosperity strengthens Juan's position. He's meticulously prepared his children for this critical social moment, understanding the nuanced expectations of noble reception. The Council of Realms' recent success provides additional political momentum.\n\nPotential challenges include Bianca's unpredictable temperament and fragile constitution. Her low piety score might expose underlying tensions. Fernando's martial weakness could invite subtle criticism from warrior-oriented nobles. Their young age presents both vulnerability and potential intrigue.\n\n\nThe Royal Family Meets the Cortes\n\n\nLate June 1439\n\n\nThe Cortes has been summoned to Toledo. Representatives from across Castile—clergy, nobility, and commons—have gathered in the great hall of the Alcázar. The agenda is ambitious: new marshalls, the three-strike rule, the coming war against the Ottomans, the Madrid construction, and the Iota coinage. But first, as tradition demands, the King presents himself and his house.\n\n\n\nThe Royal Children Present:\n\n\nPrincess Catalina — Seven years old. Brilliant (87), commanding temperament (76), legendary singing voice, beautiful (70). But spiritually indifferent (piety 7)—a hollowness that may or may not be visible to discerning observers.\n\n\nPrince Fernando, Prince of Asturias — Nearly six years old. Brilliant (82), bold (64), magnificent physical presence (87), gifted with languages (76). But unable to fight (martial aptitude 9)—the heir to five crowns cannot hold a sword properly.\n\n\nPrincess Bianca — Nearly five years old. Legendary beauty (98) that already draws gasps. Devout (71), capable (49). But volatile temperament (7) and fragile health (24)—she could charm or she could erupt.\n\n\nThe younger children—Teresa, Juana, and Nicolás—are present but kept with their nurses, too young for formal introduction.\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nJuan's prestige is at its zenith—Defensor Romaniae, ruler of five crowns\n\nQueen Lucia is elegant, sharp, and beloved\n\nCatalina's brilliance and beauty make strong impressions\n\nFernando's physical magnificence—he looks every inch a prince\n\nBianca's legendary beauty is already spoken of across the realm\n\nJuan has prepared his children, explained what to expect\n\nThe realm is prosperous; nobles are in good spirits\n\nThe Council of Realms success (roll 92) has created goodwill\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nCatalina's spiritual emptiness may show to clergy observers\n\nFernando's martial inability could surface if nobles test him with questions of arms\n\nBianca's volatile temperament is unpredictable—she could charm or cause a scene\n\nBianca's fragile health may be visible (pale, thin)\n\nChildren are still very young—unpredictable by nature\n\nSome nobles resent centralization and watch for weakness\n\nClergy may probe the children's religious formation\n\nThe succession relies on a boy who cannot fight—this will not escape notice\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nDisaster. Something goes badly wrong. Bianca throws a tantrum before the assembled nobles. Or Fernando is asked about swordplay and his inability becomes public knowledge in the worst possible way. Or Catalina's spiritual emptiness manifests as visible contempt for a bishop's blessing. The family's weaknesses are exposed; whispers begin before the formal business even starts.\n11-25\nAwkward. The children are nervous, the interactions stilted. Catalina is too commanding—she corrects a count's pronunciation and the moment lands poorly. Fernando is magnificent to look at but shrinks from a gruff old knight's questions about training. Bianca is beautiful but clings to Lucia, refusing to speak. The nobles are polite, but the impression is of children, not future rulers.\n26-40\nMixed. Some moments shine; others falter. Catalina impresses the educated clergy with her quick mind but unsettles them with her cool indifference to spiritual matters. Fernando charms the ladies of the court but visibly uncomfortable when military matters arise. Bianca is angelic for ten minutes, then grows overtired and must be removed before her temper frays. The overall impression is of a promising but uneven royal house.\n41-55\nRespectable. The children perform adequately. Catalina is poised and intelligent; Fernando is handsome and speaks well; Bianca is beautiful and behaves herself. No disasters, no transcendent moments. The nobles nod approvingly—the succession seems secure, the bloodline strong. But no one leaves talking about the extraordinary Trastámara children.\n56-70\nStrong Impression. The children exceed expectations for their age. Catalina engages a bishop in theological discussion—her brilliance evident even if her piety is not. Fernando's physical presence dominates; nobles see a future king in his bearing. Bianca's beauty draws genuine gasps, and she manages a shy smile that melts hearts. The whispers are favorable: \"The house is blessed.\"\n71-85\nMemorable. Each child has a moment that will be recounted for years. Catalina, asked to demonstrate her famous voice, sings three verses of a hymn that silences the hall. Fernando greets a Valencian merchant in flawless Catalan, then switches to Castilian without pause. Bianca curtsies to an elderly duchess with such grave sweetness that the old woman weeps. The family is not just royal—they are remarkable.\n86-95\nTriumph. The royal family presents a united image of grace, intelligence, and promise that leaves the Cortes genuinely moved. Catalina's brilliance shines without her spiritual emptiness surfacing. Fernando's magnificence makes men forget to ask about his sword arm. Bianca is perfect—beautiful, sweet, and leaves the hall before her temper can fray. Queen Lucia orchestrates it all with subtle mastery. Men leave saying, \"Castile is blessed in its king and doubly blessed in his children.\"\n96-100\nLegendary. Something transcendent occurs—a moment that will be recorded in chronicles and spoken of for generations. Perhaps Catalina sings, and grown men weep openly. Perhaps Fernando, unprompted, delivers a short speech in three languages welcoming the representatives of his father's realms. Perhaps Bianca, seeing a nervous young page, takes his hand and leads him to meet her father, showing a queen's instinct at age four. The Cortes has not yet begun its business, and already they know: the Trastámara dynasty is ascendant. God has blessed this house.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

The children are nervous, interactions are stilted, and things are going poorly. But the player wants me to stop when Juan can intervene - so I should narrate the situation deteriorating but pause before it becomes a complete disaster, giving Juan a chance to do something.\n\nLet me set the scene with things starting to go wrong, then stop at a moment where Juan can act.\n\n\nLate June 1439, Morning\n\n\nThe great hall of the Alcázar is filled with the assembled might of Castile—bishops in their vestments, grandees in silks and velvets, representatives of the commons in their finest wool. The morning light streams through high windows, illuminating the royal dais where Juan stands with his family.\n\n\nThe formal presentations begin well enough. Queen Lucia is, as always, a portrait of grace—her beauty and composure draw admiring murmurs. The younger children are whisked through quickly, presented and removed before they can cause trouble.\n\n\nBut then come the older three.\n\n\n\nCatalina steps forward first, as eldest. She is seven years old and already carries herself like a woman twice her age. Too much like a woman twice her age. When the Bishop of Palencia approaches to offer a blessing, she accepts it with a cool nod that borders on dismissiveness. Her brilliant grey-green eyes—Lucia's eyes—scan the assembled clergy with something that looks uncomfortably like assessment.\n\n\n\"Your Highness must be learning your catechism well,\" the Bishop offers kindly.\n\n\n\"I have memorized it, Your Excellency,\" Catalina replies. Her tone is correct. Perfectly correct. And utterly without warmth.\n\n\nThe Bishop's smile falters slightly. He glances at Juan.\n\n\n\nFernando is next. At nearly six, he is already tall for his age, broad-shouldered, with a physical presence that draws immediate approval. There is a king, the nobles' eyes say. He greets the first few lords with practiced courtesy, his voice clear and confident.\n\n\nThen Don Rodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes—a grizzled veteran of the Granada campaign—approaches with a warrior's directness.\n\n\n\"Your Highness grows strong,\" the Count says approvingly. \"I wager you'll be tilting at quintains soon. What weapon do you favor? The sword? The lance?\"\n\n\nFernando's magnificent composure cracks. His face flushes. His mouth opens, closes. He looks down at his hands—hands that have never held a practice sword without trembling, without dropping it, without earning the quiet sighs of his trainers.\n\n\n\"I... I am still learning, my lord,\" he manages, his voice suddenly small.\n\n\nThe Count's brow furrows. He looks at the boy more closely—sees the fear there, the shame. His expression shifts from approval to something more guarded.\n\n\nWhispers begin behind hands.\n\n\n\nBianca toddles forward, and for a moment, everything seems saved. She is not yet five, but her beauty is already extraordinary—the kind of beauty that stops breath. Golden-brown hair frames a face of perfect symmetry. The hall actually sighs.\n\n\nAn elderly Duchess approaches, enchanted. \"What a lovely child. Come, little one, let me see you.\"\n\n\nBianca curtsies—a bit wobbly, but charming. The Duchess reaches out to touch her cheek.\n\n\nAnd something shifts in Bianca's expression. Perhaps the touch was too sudden. Perhaps she is tired. Perhaps her volatile nature simply erupts, as it sometimes does without warning.\n\n\nShe slaps the Duchess's hand away.\n\n\n\"No,\" she says, her voice rising. \"Don't touch me.\"\n\n\nThe Duchess recoils, shocked. Bianca's face is reddening, her small fists clenching. Lucia is already moving, but she is three steps away—\n\n\nThe hall has gone very quiet. All eyes are on the dais."

He's framing her outburst as a reasonable response to unwanted touch - turning a negative into something more understandable. He's also complimenting the Duchess by implying she too was once a beauty who had to deal with similar challenges.\n\nThis is a diplomatic recovery attempt. I should narrate how it lands - the Duchess's reaction, the room's response, and then Lucia taking the children away.\n\nGiven the roll of 12, this is an \"Awkward\" situation. Juan's intervention might help salvage things somewhat, but the damage is partially done. The whispers about Fernando's martial inability have started, Catalina's coldness to the clergy has been noted, and Bianca's outburst was witnessed.\n\nJuan's recovery is clever - he's reframing Bianca's behavior as proto-queenly (protecting herself from those who would claim her beauty) rather than childish tantrum. And he's flattering the Duchess by implying she understands from personal experience.\n\nLet me write how this lands - it should help somewhat but not completely erase the awkwardness. The nobles have seen what they've seen.\n\n\nThe Duchess—Doña Mencía de Mendoza, a woman of sixty winters who has survived three husbands and the intrigues of two reigns—pauses. For a moment, her expression is unreadable.\n\n\nThen, slowly, a wry smile crosses her weathered face.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty is kind to an old woman's vanity,\" she says, her voice carrying just enough for those nearby to hear. \"I do remember, as it happens. I bit a bishop once, when I was her age. He had cold hands.\"\n\n\nA ripple of relieved laughter moves through the nearest nobles. The Duchess inclines her head toward Bianca, who is now half-hidden behind your leg, her small chest heaving with the aftermath of her outburst.\n\n\n\"She will be a queen who suffers no liberties, I think. There are worse faults.\"\n\n\nLucia is already there, graceful and swift. She gathers Bianca into her arms with practiced ease, murmuring something soft in Italian. Her eyes meet yours briefly—I have them—and she extends her other hand to Fernando, who takes it with visible relief. Catalina follows without being asked, her chin still high, her expression betraying nothing.\n\n\nThe royal children withdraw through a side door. The hall exhales.\n\n\n\nBut the damage lingers.\n\n\nYou can see it in the glances exchanged between the grandees. Don Rodrigo Manrique has stepped back into a cluster of military men, and though you cannot hear their words, their eyes keep returning to the door through which Fernando departed. The boy who could not answer a simple question about weapons.\n\n\nThe clergy have noticed Catalina's coldness. The Bishop of Palencia is speaking quietly with two abbots, his brow furrowed.\n\n\nAnd while the Duchess played her part beautifully, her ladies-in-waiting are already whispering. The little one struck her. Did you see? Such a temper.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna appears at your elbow, his voice low.\n\n\n\"The session can still proceed, Your Majesty. The formal business will redirect attention. But...\"\n\n\nHe does not finish the sentence. He does not need to.\n\n\nThe Cortes has seen your children. They have seen brilliance without warmth, magnificence without martial spirit, beauty without self-control. They have seen a royal house with cracks in its foundation.\n\n\nWhat they make of it will depend on what happens next."

This is an intimate family scene where Juan is trying to understand what went wrong.\n\nLet me think about each child's perspective based on their established traits:\n\n**Catalina (7)**: Brilliant (87), commanding temperament (76), legendary singing voice, beautiful (70), but spiritually indifferent (piety 7). She was cold and dismissive to the Bishop. She's likely not going to see what she did wrong - her spiritual emptiness means she doesn't understand why warmth toward clergy matters.\n\n**Fernando (nearly 6)**: Brilliant (82), bold (64), magnificent physical presence (87), gifted with languages (76), but cannot fight (martial aptitude 9). He was humiliated when asked about weapons. He's probably deeply ashamed - he knows he's supposed to be a warrior prince but he can't do it.\n\n**Bianca (nearly 5)**: Legendary beauty (98), devout (71), capable (49), but volatile temperament (7) and fragile health (24). She slapped the Duchess. She's very young and her volatility got the better of her. She might be tearful, defiant, or confused.\n\nLucia is there too - she's sharp, direct, and a good mother. She'll have her own observations.\n\nThis should be a touching family scene where the children reveal their inner struggles. The GM should let each child speak in character, showing their vulnerabilities. Then stop when Juan might want to respond or comfort them.\n\nLet me write this scene with emotional depth, showing each child's perspective without making it too easy or resolved.\n\n\nThe antechamber is quiet after the murmur of the great hall. Lucia sits on a cushioned bench, Bianca on her lap, the little girl's face buried in her mother's shoulder. Fernando stands apart by the window, his back to the room, his magnificent shoulders rigid. Catalina has claimed a chair and sits with perfect posture, watching you enter with those cool, assessing eyes.\n\n\nLucia meets your gaze. Her expression is composed, but you know her well enough to see the worry beneath.\n\n\nYou kneel, bringing yourself to their level.\n\n\n\"What happened? You are so well-behaved normally.\"\n\n\n\nBianca speaks first—or rather, wails into Lucia's gown.\n\n\n\"She grabbed me, Papa. I didn't like it. Everyone was looking at me and she grabbed me and I didn't want her to—\"\n\n\nHer words dissolve into hiccupping sobs. Lucia strokes her hair, murmuring softly.\n\n\n\"She is tired,\" Lucia says quietly. \"And overwhelmed. So many strangers, all wanting to touch the pretty princess.\" There is an edge to her voice—not directed at you, but at the situation. \"She did what any small creature does when cornered.\"\n\n\n\nFernando does not turn from the window. When he speaks, his voice is thick.\n\n\n\"I'm sorry, Father.\"\n\n\nA long pause.\n\n\n\"The Count asked about swords. And lances. And I...\" His hands clench at his sides. \"Everyone was watching. And I couldn't... I didn't know what to say. Because I can't. I can't do any of it. I try and try and the sword is too heavy and my arms don't do what I tell them and—\"\n\n\nHis voice breaks. He is nearly six years old, heir to five crowns, and he is trying very hard not to cry in front of his father.\n\n\n\"They all saw, didn't they? They all know now. That the Prince of Asturias can't hold a sword.\"\n\n\n\nCatalina has not moved. She watches her siblings with something that might be curiosity, might be detachment. When the silence stretches, she speaks.\n\n\n\"I don't understand what I did wrong.\"\n\n\nHer voice is calm, precise.\n\n\n\"The Bishop offered a blessing. I accepted it. I answered his question truthfully—I have memorized the catechism. Every word.\" She tilts her head slightly. \"Was I supposed to pretend to be something I'm not?\""

He likely enjoys riding if it's something he can do well.\n\nI should have Fernando respond to this - it's a kind gesture from Juan, redirecting him to something he CAN do rather than dwelling on what he can't. The question is how Fernando responds. Does he perk up? Is he still too upset?\n\nLet me play this realistically - Fernando is upset, ashamed, but his father is offering him an escape and something he enjoys. He's nearly six, so still young enough to be comforted by such an offer.\n\n\nFernando turns from the window. His eyes are red-rimmed, but he has not let the tears fall. At nearly six, he is already learning to hold them in—the burden of princes.\n\n\n\"I... yes, Father. I like riding.\"\n\n\nThere is a flicker of hope in his voice, fragile and uncertain. Riding is something he can do. The horse does not care that his arms cannot hold a sword steady. The horse responds to his legs, his balance, his voice. On horseback, Fernando is not the prince who cannot fight—he is simply a boy who loves the wind in his face and the thunder of hooves beneath him.\n\n\nLucia speaks gently. \"Pedro is just outside with the nurses. Shall I send for him?\"\n\n\nFernando hesitates, glancing at you. He wants to go—you can see it in the way his body has already shifted toward the door.

This is essentially a chance to recover from the earlier awkward introduction (roll 12).\n\nLet me think about the factors:\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- Juan handled the Bianca situation gracefully with the Duchess\n- The three-strike principle is a well-designed policy that should appeal to both reformers and those who want clear rules\n- Juan has prepared Fernando to show his riding skills - giving nobles a chance to see the prince excel at something\n- The Cortes is coming off the tremendous success of the Council of Realms (roll 92)\n- Juan's prestige as Defensor Romaniae is immense\n- Álvaro is managing the ceremony professionally\n- The business agenda is substantive and well-prepared\n- Shifting attention to policy matters redirects from the awkward family introduction\n- Fernando genuinely is a good rider - this isn't a gamble on unknown abilities\n- Walking outside with nobles creates an informal atmosphere that can build rapport\n- Catalina and Bianca have been given specific tasks that play to their strengths\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- The earlier impressions linger - nobles saw Fernando's fear, Catalina's coldness, Bianca's tantrum\n- Whispers have already started among the military men about Fernando\n- The clergy noticed Catalina's spiritual coldness\n- The three-strike policy, while fair, does represent an expansion of royal power over nobles - some may resist\n- Some nobles may resent the centralization implied in the Iota coinage and Madrid capital\n- Fernando could fail at riding too (though this seems unlikely given his traits)\n- The informality of the outdoor setting could lead to uncomfortable questions\n- Don Rodrigo Manrique and the military men may press the Fernando issue\n- The children's weaknesses are now known - they can't be un-seen\n\nThe roll of 12 was quite bad. This is a recovery attempt. \n\nI'll analyze the potential outcomes strategically. Juan needs a nuanced approach to transform the narrative. The recovery hinges on redirecting attention from personal shortcomings to substantive policy and Fernando's potential. By carefully managing perceptions, he might mitigate the damage from the initial awkward introduction and demonstrate the royal family's underlying strengths.\n\n\nThe Recovery Attempt\n\n\nÁlvaro has kept the ceremony moving smoothly in your brief absence. As you return to the great hall, the formal business is underway—the reading of the agenda, the invocation, the procedural matters that give men time to settle.\n\n\n\nThe Three-Strike Announcement\n\n\nThe Crown Marshalls are presented—Don Íñigo López de Orozco and his fellow marshalls standing in their royal livery, dignified and capable. The three new Itinerant Marshalls—Fray Gonzalo de Quiroga, Fray Martín de Sotomayor, and Fray Diego de Castañeda—are introduced to murmurs of interest. Knights of holy orders, men of reputation, given authority to roam the realm seeking justice.\n\n\nThen Diego de Daza reads the Ordinatio Marescallorum Coronae. The three-strike procedure. The Royal Summons. The protection of assessors. The consequences for defiance.\n\n\nThe hall listens.\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nJuan's graceful handling of the Bianca incident won points with the Duchess and nearby nobles\n\nThe three-strike policy is fair—clear rules, multiple chances, proportionate response\n\nThe Itinerant Marshalls are impressive men whose reputations precede them\n\nThe policy addresses real grievances (assessor safety) that resonate with the commons\n\nShifting to substantive business redirects attention from family matters\n\nFernando is genuinely skilled at riding—this is not a gamble\n\nThe informal outdoor setting creates opportunity for personal connection\n\nJuan's reputation remains formidable regardless of his children's performance\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nThe earlier impressions linger—whispers have already begun\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique and the military men saw Fernando's fear\n\nThe clergy noticed Catalina's coldness—they will be watching\n\nSome nobles may see the three-strike rule as royal overreach\n\nThe expansion of Crown Soldiers (150 to 200) signals growing royal power\n\nWalking to Fernando draws attention back to the heir's earlier failure\n\nIf Fernando falters at riding, the damage compounds catastrophically\n\nSome may interpret the outdoor excursion as Juan fleeing difficult questions\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nCompounding Disaster. The three-strike announcement lands poorly—nobles hear only \"the Crown will send armies against us.\" Hostile questions dominate. When Juan leads the company outside, Fernando has encountered trouble—his horse threw a shoe, or he took a fall, or he simply freezes when he sees the nobles watching. The day becomes a story of a house in disarray: children who cannot perform, policies that threaten noble privilege, a king whose family is his weakness.\n11-20\nFailed Recovery. The policy presentation is adequate but fails to shift attention. Nobles listen politely, then return to whispering about the children. The walk to the field feels like a retreat. Fernando rides competently but not spectacularly—enough to avoid disaster, not enough to impress. The day ends with the earlier damage intact: the Cortes has taken the measure of the royal children and found them wanting.\n21-35\nPartial Recovery. The three-strike policy draws genuine engagement—several nobles ask thoughtful questions, and the Itinerant Marshalls impress with their bearing. But the undercurrent of whispers continues. Fernando's riding is good—he handles the horse well, takes a few jumps cleanly—and Don Rodrigo Manrique nods grudgingly. \"The boy has some skill, at least.\" Faint praise. The damage is reduced but not erased.\n36-50\nMixed Results. The policy announcement succeeds on its merits—the commons representatives especially approve of assessor protection. The nobility is divided: some appreciate the clear procedures, others resent the implied threat. Fernando rides well, drawing genuine applause from some observers. But Don Rodrigo and the military men remain reserved. The day is neither triumph nor disaster—a wash that leaves the earlier awkwardness as the memorable moment.\n51-65\nSolid Recovery. The business of the Cortes overtakes the morning's awkwardness. The three-strike rule is debated seriously; the Itinerant Marshalls answer questions with quiet competence. By the time Juan leads the company outside, the mood has shifted. Fernando, sensing his moment, rides beautifully—confident, graceful, at one with his horse. Even Don Rodrigo Manrique admits: \"He has a cavalryman's seat.\" The military men reconsider. Perhaps the boy is not hopeless—just suited to different skills.\n66-80\nStrong Recovery. The policy presentation becomes the story of the day. Nobles engage seriously with the three-strike procedure; several openly praise its fairness. The Itinerant Marshalls are celebrated as a return to ancient traditions of roving justice. And Fernando—given his chance—shines. He rides as if born to the saddle, taking jumps that draw gasps, controlling his mount with subtle grace. Don Rodrigo Manrique approaches Juan afterward: \"Your Majesty, the boy may not be a swordsman, but he could command cavalry. There is more than one way to lead men in war.\"\n81-90\nTriumphant Recovery. The Cortes is won over. The three-strike policy is approved by acclamation; the Itinerant Marshalls receive a standing tribute. The earlier family difficulties fade into footnote. And Fernando's riding becomes the moment everyone remembers—the young prince flying across the field, taking obstacles that grown knights would hesitate at, laughing with pure joy. The nobles see not a boy who cannot hold a sword, but a future king who will lead charges from horseback. Don Rodrigo Manrique kneels before Fernando: \"Your Highness, I spoke hastily this morning. Forgive an old soldier who sees only one kind of courage.\"\n91-100\nTransformation. What began as disaster becomes legend. The policies are celebrated. The marshalls are cheered. And Fernando—sweet, magnificent Fernando who cannot hold a sword—demonstrates horsemanship that leaves veterans speechless. He does not merely ride well; he rides as if the horse were part of his own body. When he finally reins up before the assembled nobles, flushed and grinning, even the most skeptical warriors are on their feet. The story that spreads is not of a prince's weakness, but of a king's wisdom—Juan who saw his son's true gift and gave him the stage to show it. \"The Trastámaras,\" men will say, \"know how to find strength in unexpected places.\"\n\n\nRoll when ready."

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated triumphant narrative redemption through extraordinary performance.\n\nThe player rolled a 91, which falls in the 91-100 range: \"Transformation.\" This is an extraordinary outcome where the earlier disaster becomes legend. I need to narrate:\n\n1. The three-strike policy announcement going extremely well\n2. The marshalls being celebrated\n3. Fernando's horseback riding being so spectacular that it transforms the narrative completely\n4. The moment becoming legendary - not just recovery but transformation of the whole day\n\nThis should be a powerful, emotionally resonant scene. Fernando gets his redemption, and the whole Cortes is won over. I should show:\n- The policy presentation succeeding\n- Juan leading nobles outside\n- Fernando's extraordinary riding display\n- The veterans and nobles being won over\n- Don Rodrigo Manrique's change of heart\n- The narrative shifting from \"weak heir\" to \"king's wisdom in seeing his son's true gift\"\n\nI'll write this as a triumphant scene that earns the 91 roll outcome.\n\n\nThe Transformation\n\n\nThe great hall settles as Diego de Daza steps forward with the Ordinatio Marescallorum Coronae. His voice carries clearly—years of presenting treasury reports have taught him how to command attention with precision rather than volume.\n\n\nThe three-strike procedure is laid out: the definition of strikes, the accumulation in the central registry, the Royal Summons upon the third offense. The protection of assessors—guards provided, threats counted as strikes, the tiered escort system. The expansion of Crown Soldiers. The Itinerant Marshalls.\n\n\nAnd something shifts in the hall.\n\n\n\nPerhaps it is the presence of the three knight-friars standing to the side—Quiroga with his grey beard and warrior's bearing, Sotomayor with his watchful investigator's eyes, Castañeda weathered by twenty years of frontier solitude. These are not bureaucrats. These are men of God and war, given authority to roam the realm seeking justice.\n\n\nPerhaps it is the policy itself—clear, fair, graduated. Three chances before the summons. The summons itself not punishment but opportunity. Only defiance of the summons treated as rebellion.\n\n\nPerhaps it is simply that the commons representatives, who have heard their constituents' complaints about noble obstruction for years, finally see a king willing to act.\n\n\nThe Bishop of Burgos rises. \"Your Majesty, this is... this is what the Church has long called for. Protection for those who serve the Crown's lawful purposes. Justice that is firm but not tyrannical.\"\n\n\nDon Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza—returned from his Burgundy mission—stands next. \"The Council of Great Houses will support this measure. We have always said that those who pay their obligations honestly should not suffer while others evade. This gives teeth to that principle.\"\n\n\nA representative of the commons, a merchant from Seville, actually applauds. Others join him.\n\n\nThe Itinerant Marshalls are asked to speak. Fray Gonzalo de Quiroga steps forward and describes, in simple terms, his vision: riding into villages where royal authority is a rumor, finding the widow whose case was never heard, the tenant whose lord ignores the law.\n\n\n\"We shall be the King's eyes in dark places,\" he says. \"And where we find injustice, we shall shine His Majesty's light upon it.\"\n\n\nThe hall rises in tribute.\n\n\n\nThe Walk to the Field\n\n\nAn hour later, with the formal presentation concluded and questions answered, you make your announcement.\n\n\n\"I would take some air. The field beyond the eastern gate is pleasant this time of day. Those who wish may join me.\"\n\n\nIt is not a command. It is an invitation. And yet nearly half the Cortes follows—nobles curious about what the King intends, clergy grateful for respite from the stuffy hall, commons representatives who have never walked casually beside their sovereign.\n\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique is among them. His weathered face is unreadable.\n\n\nThe company walks through the Alcázar's gardens, through the eastern gate, and out to the broad field where the royal horses are exercised. And there—\n\n\n\nFernando\n\n\nHe does not see you at first. He is too absorbed in what he is doing.\n\n\nThe horse beneath him is a grey destrier, far too large for a boy not yet six—but Fernando handles it as if the animal were an extension of his own body. He moves at a canter across the field, his seat perfect, his hands light on the reins. His face is transformed: the shame, the fear, the desperate inadequacy of the morning—all of it is gone. In its place is joy.\n\n\nPedro, his companion, watches from the fence. He sees your company approaching and starts to call out—but you raise a hand. Let him ride.\n\n\nFernando guides the horse toward a series of obstacles that have been set up for cavalry training. Low jumps, nothing dangerous, but challenging enough for a grown knight.\n\n\nHe takes them.\n\n\nNot hesitantly. Not cautiously. He flies.\n\n\nThe grey destrier soars over the first barrier, lands clean, adjusts instantly to Fernando's subtle guidance, and takes the second. Then the third. Each jump is better than the last—the boy learning, adapting, feeling what the horse needs in the fraction of a heartbeat between takeoff and landing.\n\n\nA gasp runs through the watching nobles.\n\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique has gone very still.\n\n\n\nFernando circles the field, building speed. There is one final obstacle—higher than the others, a jump that some of your knights avoid in training. Pedro sees where he is heading and shouts a warning: \"Your Highness, that one is—\"\n\n\nBut Fernando is already committed.\n\n\nThe grey destrier gathers itself. Fernando leans forward, his small body perfectly positioned, his weight exactly where it needs to be. For one crystalline moment, horse and rider are suspended in air—a prince who cannot hold a sword, flying as if gravity were merely a suggestion.\n\n\nThey land clean.\n\n\nFernando wheels the horse around, finally seeing the crowd. His face flushes—but not with shame this time. With the pure, radiant joy of a child who has found his gift.\n\n\nHe trots over to where you stand, reining up with unconscious grace. The destrier, which has thrown squires twice Fernando's age, stands calm beneath him.\n\n\n\"Father,\" he says, slightly out of breath. \"Did you see?\"\n\n\n\nThe Response\n\n\nThe silence lasts three heartbeats. Then Don Rodrigo Manrique does something no one expects.\n\n\nHe walks forward, past the other nobles, past the clergy, past you. He stops before Fernando's horse and—slowly, deliberately—goes to one knee.\n\n\n\"Your Highness.\"\n\n\nHis voice is rough. The voice of a man who has fought in a dozen campaigns, who has seen boys become men and men become corpses.\n\n\n\"This morning I asked about swords and lances. I was a fool. An old fool who sees only one kind of strength.\"\n\n\nHe looks up at Fernando—really looks at him.\n\n\n\"I have commanded cavalry for thirty years. I have seen knights who could fight like demons on foot and rode like sacks of grain in the saddle. And I have seen men who were nothing special with a blade, but on horseback...\" He shakes his head. \"On horseback, they were worth ten swordsmen.\"\n\n\nHe bows his head.\n\n\n\"Your Highness has a gift. A true gift. And I would be honored—if Your Majesty permits—to teach you how to use it. Not the sword. The charge. How to read a battlefield from horseback. How to lead men where they need to go. How to be the kind of commander who wins wars without ever crossing blades.\"\n\n\nFernando looks at you, uncertain. His eyes are bright with tears he is too proud to shed.\n\n\n\nThe other nobles have gathered close. The whispers are different now.\n\n\n\"Did you see that jump? Knights twice his age won't take that one.\"\n\n\n\"The boy's a natural. Better than natural.\"\n\n\n\"Perhaps the sword arm doesn't matter. Put him on a horse and point him at the enemy...\"\n\n\nThe Bishop of Palencia, who had frowned at Catalina's coldness this morning, makes the sign of the cross.\n\n\n\"God gives each of us different gifts,\" he says, loudly enough for others to hear. \"The wise king sees his children clearly and finds the path for each. This is such a king.\"\n\n\n\nThe company begins to return to the Alcázar. But the story that spreads is not of a prince's weakness revealed. It is of a father's wisdom—a king who saw his son failing in one arena and quietly, without fanfare, gave him another stage.\n\n\n\"The Trastámaras,\" men will say for years afterward, \"know how to find strength in unexpected places.\"\n\n\nAnd Fernando rides beside you, sitting tall in the saddle, finally knowing what he was born to do."

Earlier, Lucia was going to take Bianca to show her embroidery to the ladies and have her demonstrate her Latin prayers. Let me write a scene showing how that went.\n\n\nThe Antechamber\n\n\nYou find them in a smaller receiving room adjacent to the great hall. Lucia has transformed the space—cushions arranged in a comfortable circle, afternoon light streaming through the windows, a sense of intimacy rather than formality.\n\n\nBianca sits on a low stool, her embroidery frame balanced on her lap. Around her, a half-dozen noble ladies have gathered—the Duchess Doña Mencía de Mendoza among them, the very woman Bianca struck hours ago. Two ladies-in-waiting from the Velasco family. The Countess of Haro. Several others whose faces you recognize from court.\n\n\nThey are cooing.\n\n\n\"—such even stitches! My dear, I could not do half so well at twice your age—\"\n\n\n\"—the little birds are precious, see how she has done the wings—\"\n\n\n\"—and her Latin, have you heard her Latin—\"\n\n\nLucia sees you enter and her eyes meet yours. There is quiet triumph in her expression—and relief. She inclines her head slightly toward the scene.\n\n\nBianca has not noticed your arrival. She is absorbed in demonstrating a stitch to the Duchess, her small fingers moving with careful precision. Her earlier tantrum might never have happened. She is calm, focused, showing rather than being looked at. The ladies are not grabbing at her—they are watching her hands, admiring her work, treating her as a small artist rather than a pretty object to be touched.\n\n\n\"Your Highness has a true gift for needlework,\" the Duchess says warmly. \"You must make something for your father. A handkerchief for his pocket, perhaps?\"\n\n\nBianca looks up at this—and sees you standing in the doorway.\n\n\nHer face transforms. Not the volatile storm of the morning, but something softer. Shyness, mixed with hope.\n\n\n\"Papa.\" She holds up the embroidery frame. \"I'm showing them my birds. The Duchess said they were the finest she's seen from anyone under ten.\"\n\n\nThe Duchess rises and curtsies to you. When she straightens, her expression is knowing.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty. The Princess has been a perfect hostess. She led us in the Pater Noster—in flawless Latin, I might add—and has been teaching us a Ferrarese stitch that Her Grace the Queen brought from Italy.\" She glances at Bianca with genuine fondness. \"I believe I understand her better now. She does not like to be admired. She likes to be useful. A rare quality, and a good one.\"\n\n\nLucia rises gracefully and comes to your side, her voice low.\n\n\n\"The ladies have been charmed. The story they will tell is of a devout little princess with clever hands and a scholar's Latin.\" A pause. \"What of Fernando?\""

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed Catalina's extraordinary talents against her emotional vulnerabilities for performance.\n\nThe user wants a d100 table for Catalina's performance. This is a pivotal moment - earlier in the day, Catalina came across as cold and spiritually empty to the clergy. Juan has spoken to her privately, reminding her of the nights under the stars when they talked to her deceased mother Isabel and cried together. He asked her to remember that feeling when she sings - to show people what they should feel, even if she herself doesn't feel it naturally.\n\nThis is a complex situation. Catalina has:\n- Legendary singing voice (special talent)\n- Brilliant intelligence (87)\n- Commanding temperament (76)\n- Beautiful (70)\n- But spiritually indifferent/empty (piety 7)\n\nThe earlier interaction with the Bishop was cold and dismissive. But Juan has given her specific guidance - remember the stars, remember crying for her mother, channel that into her performance.\n\nSuccess Factors:\n- Catalina has a legendary singing voice - this is established as extraordinary\n- She is brilliant and understood her father's instructions\n- Juan's framing (\"she is still very young, ask understanding for the burden we place on such a young child\") creates sympathy and lowers expectations\n- The day has been recovering - Fernando's triumph, Bianca charming the ladies\n- Catalina made a promise to her father: \"I can do that, Papa. For you. And for Mama.\"\n- The context (praying for coming war) gives emotional weight\n- A psalm is structured - she knows what to do\n- The memory of her mother is genuinely emotional for her - she did cry under the stars\n\nFailure Factors:\n- Catalina's natural coldness could reassert itself under pressure\n- She is only seven years old - children can be unpredictable\n- The clergy are already watching her with suspicion\n- She may intellectually understand what to do but fail to execute emotionally\n- The pressure of the hall, the expectations, could overwhelm her\n- She might sing technically perfectly but without the warmth her father asked for\n\n\n- Her spiritual emptiness (piety 7) is a fundamental character trait, not easily overcome\n\nHer deep-seated emotional detachment presents a significant challenge. Despite her extraordinary talents and brilliant understanding, her core spiritual indifference threatens to undermine her performance. The emotional connection Juan seeks is not her natural state, making her potential success a delicate balancing act between intellectual comprehension and genuine emotional expression.\n\n\nThe Final Test\n\n\nThe great hall has filled again for the evening session. Word has spread of Fernando's triumph in the field—Don Rodrigo Manrique has told the story three times already, each telling more admiring than the last. The mood is warmer than it was this morning. But the clergy remember Catalina's coldness. They are watching.\n\n\nYou rise to address the assembled Cortes on the matter of the coming war.\n\n\n\nThe Speech\n\n\nYou speak of Constantinople. Of the walls your knights now guard. Of the Ottoman sultan who grows stronger each year, whose fleet has doubled at Gallipoli, whose armies have crushed the Karamanids and brought Serbia to heel. You speak of the truce that expires in 1445—six years hence—and of what must be done before that day comes.\n\n\nYou speak of muster and preparation. Of alliances to be forged. Of the crusade that has been deferred but not abandoned.\n\n\nThe hall listens. These are men who remember Granada. They know what holy war looks like when it is led by a king who means it.\n\n\n\"And so,\" you conclude, \"it is fitting that we close this day with prayer. Prayer for the war to come. Prayer for those who will fight it. Prayer for those who will not return.\"\n\n\nYou pause.\n\n\n\"My daughter Catalina will lead us in a psalm.\"\n\n\nA murmur runs through the hall. The girl who was so cold this morning? The princess who accepted a bishop's blessing like she was receiving a tax receipt?\n\n\nYou add, gently: \"She is still very young. I ask your understanding for the burden we all place on such a young child.\"\n\n\nThe murmur softens. Men nod. Of course—she is only seven. Expectations adjust.\n\n\nYou walk Catalina to the center of the hall. She is small against the vastness of it—a girl in a fine dress, surrounded by the assembled might of Castile. Her grey-green eyes sweep the room, and for a moment you see the cool assessment that troubled the Bishop this morning.\n\n\nThen her eyes meet yours.\n\n\nYou give her a quick nod of encouragement.\n\n\nRemember the stars. Remember Mama.\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nCatalina's voice is genuinely legendary—a gift given once in a generation\n\nShe is brilliant and understood exactly what you asked of her\n\nShe made a promise: \"For you. And for Mama.\"\n\nYour framing lowered expectations and created sympathy\n\nThe day has been recovering—goodwill has been rebuilt\n\nThe memory of Isabel is genuinely emotional for her—she cried under the stars\n\nA psalm provides structure; she knows the words perfectly\n\nThe context (war, sacrifice, prayer) provides emotional weight\n\nFernando's triumph and Bianca's recovery have shifted the narrative\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nCatalina's spiritual emptiness (piety 7) is deep and genuine\n\nShe is seven years old—children can freeze, forget, falter\n\nThe clergy are watching with particular scrutiny\n\nShe may execute technically but fail to convey warmth\n\nThe pressure of hundreds of eyes could overwhelm her\n\nShe might intellectually understand what to do but be unable to summon the feeling\n\nHer coolness may reassert under stress—a defense mechanism\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDisaster. Catalina freezes. The hall waits. She opens her mouth and nothing comes out—or worse, she begins and her voice cracks, breaks, fails. She flees in tears, or stands paralyzed, or snaps something cold at a well-meaning bishop who tries to help. The day's recovery is undone. The story becomes: the heir cannot fight, the beauty has a temper, and the brilliant one cannot perform when it matters.\n6-15\nCold Perfection. Catalina sings. Her voice is extraordinary—technically flawless, every note precise. But there is nothing behind it. She might as well be reciting a list of numbers. The clergy exchange glances. The commons are unmoved. It is a performance, and everyone can tell it is only a performance. The whispers resume: beautiful voice, empty heart.\n16-30\nAdequate. Catalina sings adequately. Her voice is good—better than good—but she is clearly nervous, clearly trying too hard. There are moments of beauty, but they do not sustain. The hall applauds politely. No disaster, no triumph. The clergy reserve judgment. She is only seven, after all. Perhaps in time...\n31-45\nGlimpses. Catalina begins hesitantly, but finds her footing. There are moments—a phrase here, a sustained note there—where something real breaks through. The memory of her mother, perhaps. The stars. But she cannot hold it; the coldness returns between the moments of warmth. The performance is uneven. Some are moved; others see through it. A mixed verdict.\n46-60\nGenuine Effort. Catalina remembers the stars. You can see it in her face—the moment she stops performing and starts feeling. Her voice, always beautiful, takes on warmth. The psalm becomes a prayer. Not transcendent, but real. The clergy nod approvingly. The commons are moved. The day ends well, if not spectacularly.\n61-75\nMoving. Catalina sings, and the hall grows still. She has found it—the memory of her mother, the nights under the stars, the grief she buried so deep. Her voice carries it all. Women weep. Men bow their heads. The Bishop of Palencia, who frowned at her this morning, makes the sign of the cross. When she finishes, the silence lasts three heartbeats before the applause begins.\n76-85\nTranscendent. Something happens that cannot be explained by technique alone. Catalina opens her mouth, and what emerges is not just beautiful—it is holy. The psalm becomes a living thing, filling the hall, reaching into hearts. Hardened soldiers weep openly. The clergy fall to their knees. When the last note fades, no one applauds—applause would be profane. They simply pray. And Catalina, for the first time in years, prays with them—because for one shining moment, she felt something real.\n86-95\nThe Gift Revealed. Catalina does not merely sing—she ministers. Every person in the hall feels as though she is singing directly to them, to their grief, to their fear of the war to come, to their hope for salvation. The psalm becomes an anthem. The coming crusade becomes holy. When she finishes, Don Rodrigo Manrique—who has killed men by the dozen—is weeping like a child. The Bishop of Burgos declares it a miracle. And Catalina, looking at you through her own tears, whispers: \"I saw her, Papa. I saw Mama.\"\n96-100\nLegend Born. What happens in the great hall of the Alcázar in June 1439 will be recorded in chronicles, painted by artists, spoken of for generations. A seven-year-old princess opens her mouth to sing a psalm, and for the space of that song, heaven touches earth. Every soul present knows—knows—that they are witnessing something that transcends music, transcends performance, transcends the natural order. The crusade is blessed before it begins. The Trastámara dynasty is sanctified. And Catalina—empty, cold, brilliant Catalina—discovers that she is not empty after all. She has simply been waiting for the right moment to feel. When the last note fades and she collapses into your arms, sobbing for a mother she barely remembers, even the most cynical hearts in the hall understand: they have seen grace made manifest.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

Catalina, who has been spiritually empty (piety 7), who was cold to the Bishop this morning, who made a promise to her father to remember the stars and her mother - she now sings and something transcendent happens.\n\nI need to write this scene with the emotional weight it deserves. This is a seven-year-old girl who lost her mother when she was barely 18 months old, who has built walls around herself, who is brilliant but cold - and now, in front of the assembled Cortes, she breaks through.\n\nThe key elements from the roll result:\n- She doesn't merely sing—she *ministers*\n- Every person feels she is singing directly to them\n- The psalm becomes an anthem\n- The coming crusade becomes holy\n- Don Rodrigo Manrique weeps like a child\n- The Bishop of Burgos declares it a miracle\n- She sees her mother: \"I saw her, Papa. I saw Mama.\"\n\nThis needs to be written beautifully, with genuine emotion, showing the transformation both in the hall and in Catalina herself. This is a redemption moment for the entire day - Fernando showed his gift on horseback, Bianca showed her gift with embroidery and prayer, and now Catalina shows hers with song.\n\nI should also tie this back to the earlier conversation Juan had with her about the stars and her mother. This is the payoff for that moment.\n\n\nThe Gift Revealed\n\n\nCatalina stands alone in the center of the great hall. The last light of the June evening streams through the western windows, catching motes of dust suspended in the air, gilding her dark hair with gold. She looks impossibly small—a seven-year-old girl surrounded by the assembled might of Castile, five hundred souls waiting to judge her.\n\n\nShe closes her eyes.\n\n\nFor a moment, nothing happens. The hall holds its breath. You see her lips move silently—not the words of the psalm, something else. Something private.\n\n\nMama. I'm going to sing for you now.\n\n\nAnd then she opens her mouth.\n\n\n\nThe psalm is the De Profundis. Out of the depths I cry to thee, O Lord. It is a psalm of grief, of longing, of desperate hope. It is the psalm sung for the dead, for the dying, for those who go to war and may not return.\n\n\nCatalina's voice rises into the vaulted space, and something extraordinary happens.\n\n\nIt is not just that her voice is beautiful—though it is, crystalline and pure, a voice that seems too large for her small body. It is not just that her Latin is flawless—though it is, each word perfectly formed, each phrase shaped with instinctive musicality.\n\n\nIt is that she means it.\n\n\nThe coolness is gone. The assessment is gone. The walls she has built around herself since she was too young to understand why her mother wasn't there anymore—they crumble, and what pours out is everything she has kept locked away.\n\n\nDe profundis clamavi ad te, Domine...\n\n\nShe is not performing. She is praying. For the first time in her memory, Catalina of Castile is truly, genuinely praying.\n\n\n\nThe effect on the hall is immediate.\n\n\nThe Countess of Haro, who lost two sons in the Granada campaign, begins to weep silently. She is not alone. Across the hall, hands rise to cover mouths, to wipe eyes, to clutch at crosses.\n\n\nSi iniquitates observaveris, Domine, Domine, quis sustinebit?\n\n\nIf thou, O Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand?\n\n\nThe Bishop of Palencia, who frowned at Catalina's coldness this morning, has fallen to his knees. His lips move in silent prayer, tears streaming down his weathered cheeks. Beside him, the Bishop of Burgos makes the sign of the cross again and again, as if he cannot stop.\n\n\nQuia apud te propitiatio est...\n\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique—the grizzled veteran who has killed men by the dozen, who kneeled before Fernando just hours ago—stands rigid as stone. His jaw is clenched. His eyes are fixed on Catalina. And then, slowly, a tear traces down his scarred cheek. Then another. Then he is weeping openly, making no effort to hide it, a soldier undone by a child's voice.\n\n\nEt propter legem tuam sustinui te, Domine...\n\n\nThe commons representatives have bowed their heads. The merchants, the guildsmen, the men who deal in wool and iron and salt—they are praying. Some of them have not truly prayed in years. They are praying now.\n\n\nSustinuit anima mea in verbo eius, speravit anima mea in Domino...\n\n\nMy soul has hoped in the Lord.\n\n\n\nLucia stands beside you. Her hand finds yours and grips it tightly. When you glance at her, you see tears on her face—Lucia, who learned never to cry in Ferrara, who only found her tears again when Catalina accepted her as \"Lucia-mama.\"\n\n\n\"Dio mio,\" she whispers. \"Juan... do you see her?\"\n\n\nYou see her.\n\n\nYour daughter stands in the golden light, her eyes still closed, her face transformed. The cool, assessing brilliance is gone. In its place is something raw and real and achingly beautiful—a little girl singing to her mother in heaven, finally letting herself feel the loss she has carried since before she could walk.\n\n\nA custodia matutina usque ad noctem, speret Israel in Domino...\n\n\nFrom the morning watch even until night, let Israel hope in the Lord.\n\n\nHer voice swells on the word speret—hope. It fills the hall, reaches into every corner, touches every heart. The crusade you spoke of moments ago is no longer a political matter, a strategic necessity. It is holy. It is sacred. These men will march to Constantinople not for glory or gold, but because a seven-year-old girl has reminded them what faith sounds like.\n\n\nQuia apud Dominum misericordia, et copiosa apud eum redemptio...\n\n\nFor with the Lord there is mercy, and with him plentiful redemption.\n\n\n\nThe final verse approaches. Catalina's voice drops to something barely above a whisper—and yet every soul in the hall hears it perfectly, as if she is singing directly into each of their hearts.\n\n\nEt ipse redimet Israel ex omnibus iniquitatibus eius.\n\n\nAnd he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.\n\n\nThe last note hangs in the air like a living thing. It does not fade so much as ascend, rising toward the vaulted ceiling, toward the heavens, toward wherever Isabel of Portugal waits for the daughter she barely knew.\n\n\nThen silence.\n\n\n\nNo one applauds. Applause would be obscene. This was not a performance to be rewarded with clapping. This was a sacrament.\n\n\nThe Bishop of Burgos rises unsteadily to his feet. His voice, when it comes, is hoarse with emotion.\n\n\n\"I have served the Church for forty years,\" he says. \"I have heard the finest choirs in Christendom. I have stood in the Sistine Chapel and heard the Pope's own singers.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"I have never... never... heard anything like what we have just witnessed.\"\n\n\nHe turns to face the assembly.\n\n\n\"This was not merely music, my brothers and sisters. This was grace made manifest. God has blessed this house. God has blessed this crusade. God has blessed this king and his children.\"\n\n\nHe falls to his knees again.\n\n\n\"Te Deum laudamus,\" he begins, and the entire hall takes up the hymn—five hundred voices raised in thanksgiving, in awe, in the unshakeable conviction that they have witnessed something holy.\n\n\n\nCatalina opens her eyes.\n\n\nFor a moment, she seems confused—as if she has been somewhere else and has only now returned. She looks at the kneeling bishops, the weeping soldiers, the praying commons. She looks at Lucia, at you.\n\n\nAnd then she runs to you, small feet flying across the stones, and throws herself into your arms.\n\n\nShe is sobbing. Great, heaving sobs that shake her entire body. The walls are down and everything is pouring out—years of carefully constructed coldness, of refusing to feel, of protecting herself from the mother-shaped wound at the center of her heart.\n\n\n\"Papa,\" she chokes out between sobs. \"Papa, I saw her. While I was singing. I saw her.\"\n\n\nYou hold her tight. Your own eyes are burning.\n\n\n\"She was in the light,\" Catalina whispers. \"She was smiling at me. She said... she said she was proud of me. She said she's always watching. From the stars.\"\n\n\nShe pulls back to look at you, her grey-green eyes—Lucia's eyes, but also somehow Isabel's eyes—swimming with tears.\n\n\n\"She's not gone, Papa. She's just... waiting. Waiting until we can all be together again.\"\n\n\n\nThe Te Deum swells around you. Lucia's hand rests on Catalina's back. Somewhere in the hall, Don Rodrigo Manrique is still weeping.\n\n\nAnd you hold your daughter—your brilliant, complicated, wounded, healing daughter—and know that whatever comes next, this moment will be remembered.\n\n\nThe Cortes of 1439 will be recorded in chronicles for the policies announced, the marshalls presented, the crusade proclaimed. But the story that spreads across Castile, that passes from mouth to mouth in taverns and churches and noble halls, is simpler:\n\n\nThe King's daughter sang, and heaven answered."

Queen Lucia as regent during campaigns\n2. The system of governors in every crownland\n3. Madrid and the Iota symbol\n4. Distribution of the new Iota coins to every member\n\nThis is the conclusion of a very successful Cortes. The earlier disasters with the children have been transformed into triumphs - Fernando's riding, Bianca's embroidery and piety, and Catalina's transcendent singing. The mood should be excellent.\n\nI should write this as a narrative conclusion to the Cortes, showing the announcements being made and the positive reception. This doesn't need a roll - it's largely ceremonial and the groundwork has been laid. The Council of Realms is already working (roll 92), the governors are in place, the coin dies are being prepared, and the mood after Catalina's singing is reverential.\n\nLet me write a satisfying conclusion to this chapter of the Cortes.\n\n\nThe Closing Session\n\n\nLate June 1439, Evening\n\n\nThe Te Deum fades. The hall slowly returns to something like order, though the atmosphere has been permanently altered. Men who entered this morning as political actors—calculating advantage, weighing factions—now sit in the stillness that follows a sacred experience. Whatever comes next will be received differently than it would have been hours ago.\n\n\nYou stand, Catalina still close beside you, her small hand gripping yours. Lucia rises to join you on the dais, and the hall watches as the royal family presents itself anew—not the awkward, fractured display of the morning, but something unified. Something blessed.\n\n\n\nThe Regency\n\n\n\"When I march east,\" you begin, your voice carrying easily in the attentive silence, \"the realm must be governed in my absence. As it was when I journeyed to Constantinople. As it was when I secured Naples for my cousin Alfonso.\"\n\n\nYou extend your hand to Lucia, who steps forward with the grace that has never failed her.\n\n\n\"Her Majesty Queen Lucia will rule as Regent, with the full authority of the Crown. Don Álvaro de Luna will continue as chief minister, and the Royal Council will advise as it has always done. But the voice that speaks in my absence will be the Queen's voice. Her word will be my word. Her seal will be my seal.\"\n\n\nLucia inclines her head to the assembly. She does not smile—this is not a moment for smiles—but there is quiet confidence in her bearing. The nobles have seen her at council meetings for six years now. They know her mind is sharp, her judgment sound, her loyalty absolute.\n\n\nThe Bishop of Burgos, still moved from Catalina's psalm, rises to speak. \"The Church recognizes and blesses this arrangement. Her Majesty has proven herself a faithful daughter of the Church and a wise counselor to the King. We shall support her regency with our prayers and our obedience.\"\n\n\nA murmur of assent runs through the clergy. The nobility follows—not because they must, but because in this moment, opposition feels almost sacrilegious.\n\n\n\nThe Governors\n\n\n\"The Crown now spans five realms,\" you continue. \"Castile. Aragón. Naples. Sicily. Constantinople. No king can be in five places at once. Therefore, I have appointed governors to represent royal authority in each territory.\"\n\n\nYou gesture, and Álvaro de Luna steps forward with a parchment.\n\n\n\"In Castile, I govern directly, with administrators working in my name. In Granada, Don García López de Padilla continues his excellent stewardship. In Aragón, Guillem de Santcliment serves as Procurador Real. In Naples, Count Marino Brancaccio holds authority. In Constantinople, a military commander coordinates with George Sphrantzes, who manages the imperial treasury.\"\n\n\nThe names are not new—they have been in place for fifteen months—but the formal announcement before the Cortes gives them weight and legitimacy.\n\n\n\"And here in Toledo,\" you add, \"the Council of Realms sits in permanent session. Five representatives, one from each realm, advising the Crown on matters that touch the whole empire.\"\n\n\nYou pause, letting this sink in.\n\n\n\"Don Alonso Pérez de Vivero for Castile. Don Martín de Gurrea for Aragón. Count Giacomo Carafa for Naples. Don Berenguer de Requesens for Sicily. Bishop Theodoros Metochites for Constantinople. These men have already begun their work. They argue fiercely—\" a slight smile \"—and they advise wisely. Through them, every corner of the empire has a voice in Toledo.\"\n\n\nDon Martín de Gurrea, the Aragonese representative, is present in the hall. He rises and bows—a gesture that would have been unthinkable from an Aragonese official a decade ago, but the Council of Realms has changed something in him.\n\n\n\"The fueros of Aragón are preserved,\" he says, his voice carrying. \"And yet we are heard. This is... this is what unity should look like.\"\n\n\n\nMadrid and the Iota\n\n\nThe light has shifted to the deep gold of late evening. Servants have lit candles along the walls, and the hall glows with warm light.\n\n\n\"One empire,\" you say. \"Five realms. Many peoples. Many tongues. Many traditions. How do we show the world—and ourselves—that we are one?\"\n\n\nYou gesture, and Maestro Giorgio di Montepulciano steps forward with a large parchment: the plans for Madrid. He unrolls it, and attendants hold it up for the assembly to see.\n\n\n\"A new capital. Madrid. Built on the principle of unity.\"\n\n\nThe hall stirs with interest. Madrid is a small town, a hunting lodge, a place of no particular importance. And yet—\n\n\n\"The city will be built around a symbol. A symbol that declares what we are.\"\n\n\nYou trace the design on the parchment.\n\n\n\"The Iota. The first letter of Iesus in Greek. One vertical stroke—the authority of God descending to earth. Three horizontal strokes—the three estates of the realm, clergy, nobility, and commons—united under divine guidance. Or, if you prefer: the three continents where we now hold sway—Europe, Africa, Asia. Or the three virtues on which empire rests—faith, justice, and mercy.\"\n\n\nThe symbol is simple. Elegant. Unmistakable.\n\n\n\"The great avenue of Madrid will trace this symbol. The plazas will sit where the strokes cross. And at the heart of it all, a monument two hundred feet high, visible for miles—the Iota Tower, declaring to all the world what this empire stands for.\"\n\n\nMaestro Giorgio bows and steps back. The assembly studies the plans with fascination.\n\n\n\nThe Coin\n\n\n\"But a symbol carved in stone takes decades to build. A symbol that passes from hand to hand, that travels with merchants and soldiers and pilgrims across the known world—that can begin tomorrow.\"\n\n\nYou nod to Maestro Hernán de Córdoba, who steps forward with a velvet-lined case. He opens it, and the candlelight catches gold.\n\n\n\"The Iota. Struck at the Granada mint. The same weight and purity as the Florentine florin—it will be accepted anywhere in Christendom.\"\n\n\nYou lift one of the coins and hold it up for the assembly to see. On one face, your profile: IOANNES II DEFENSOR ROMANIAE. On the other, the Iota symbol, bold and simple: UNUM IMPERIUM SUB DEO.\n\n\n\"One Empire Under God.\"\n\n\nThe hall is utterly silent.\n\n\n\"Every member of this Cortes will receive one of these coins tonight. Not as payment—as witness. You were here when the Iota was born. When you show this coin to your children and grandchildren, you can tell them: I was there. I saw the beginning.\"\n\n\nAttendants begin moving through the hall, carrying velvet bags. One by one, the representatives of Castile—bishops and abbots, dukes and counts, merchants and guildsmen—receive a golden Iota. They hold the coins up to the candlelight, turning them, studying the design.\n\n\nDon Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza examines his coin and then rises. \"Your Majesty. This coin will outlast us all. A thousand years from now, men will dig these from the earth and know that once there was an empire that believed in something greater than itself.\"\n\n\nHe bows deeply.\n\n\n\"Unum Imperium Sub Deo. May it be so.\"\n\n\n\nThe Conclusion\n\n\nYou look out over the assembly—the clergy still moved by Catalina's psalm, the military men still thinking of Fernando's ride, the nobles still processing the scope of what has been announced. Crown Marshalls. Three-strike procedures. Regency arrangements. Governors. The Council of Realms. Madrid. The Iota.\n\n\nIt is, perhaps, the most consequential Cortes since the one that launched the Granada crusade.\n\n\n\"My lords spiritual and temporal. Representatives of the commons. You came to Toledo to hear my plans for the realm. You have heard them. The war with the Ottomans approaches. The empire must be governed. Justice must be enforced. A new capital must be built. A new currency must circulate.\"\n\n\nYou pause.\n\n\n\"But more than any of this—more than policies and coins and buildings—I ask you to remember what you witnessed today. My son Fernando, who cannot hold a sword, riding as if born to the saddle. My daughter Bianca, who struggles with her temper, leading ladies of the court in prayer and needlework. My daughter Catalina, who has been so careful with her heart, opening it before God and all of you.\"\n\n\nYour voice softens.\n\n\n\"This is what empire means. Not conquest alone. Not gold alone. Not power alone. It means finding the strength in each of us—the strength God gave us, even when we cannot see it ourselves—and placing it in service of something greater.\"\n\n\nYou raise your hand in blessing, as you have seen the Pope do.\n\n\n\"Go with God. Return to your homes. Tell your people what you have seen and heard. And when the call comes to march east—as it will, in God's good time—remember this day. Remember that we are one empire, under God, and that nothing can stand against us if we remain true to that calling.\"\n\n\nThe Bishop of Burgos rises and offers the final benediction. The assembly responds. And then, slowly, the Cortes of 1439 comes to its end.\n\n\n\nMen linger in the hall, talking in small groups, examining their coins, processing the day. The whispers that reach your ears are different from the whispers of the morning.\n\n\n\"The boy will command cavalry like his grandfather commanded infantry...\"\n\n\n\"The little one's embroidery—and her Latin! At four years old...\"\n\n\n\"I wept. I am not ashamed to say it. When the princess sang, I wept like a child...\"\n\n\n\"One empire under God. It has a ring to it, doesn't it?\"\n\n\n\"Madrid. A new capital. Bold. Very bold. But if anyone can do it...\"\n\n\nLucia finds you as the hall slowly empties. She takes your arm and leans close.\n\n\n\"It was a disaster this morning,\" she murmurs. \"And now they will speak of this Cortes for a hundred years.\"\n\n\nShe looks up at you, those grey-green eyes—Catalina's eyes—warm with pride and something deeper.\n\n\n\"How did you know? That Fernando needed to ride. That Bianca needed to be useful. That Catalina needed permission to feel.\"\n\n\nShe shakes her head slowly.\n\n\n\"You see them, Juan. You see all of us. That is your gift.\"\n\n\n\nThe Cortes of 1439 is concluded."

This is a beautiful, intimate scene after the triumph of the Cortes. Let me write this as a warm family moment in the royal apartments, with the older children (Catalina, Fernando, Bianca) sharing their stories, and perhaps the younger ones (Teresa, Juana, Nicolás) present but not really understanding.\n\nThis should be a quiet, tender scene - a contrast to the public drama of the day. The children will be excited, processing what happened, and sharing with each other in the way siblings do.\n\nLet me set the scene in the royal apartments of the Alcázar, evening, with the family gathered together.\n\n\nThe Royal Apartments, Alcázar of Toledo\n\n\nLate Evening\n\n\nThe public face of monarchy has been set aside. The great hall is empty now, servants sweeping away the remnants of the day. But in the private chambers of the royal family, candles burn low and the air is warm with the particular intimacy that only family knows.\n\n\nThe children have been bathed and dressed for bed, but no one is sleeping. They are too full of the day, too brimming with stories that must be told. Lucia has arranged them in the solar—cushions and blankets scattered across the floor, a fire crackling despite the summer warmth because Bianca likes to watch the flames.\n\n\nYou settle into a chair. Lucia sits beside you, her hand resting on your arm. The younger children—Teresa, nearly four, and Juana, two and a half—are curled together on a cushion, fighting sleep. Baby Nicolás, not yet two, is already asleep in his nurse's arms in the corner, but the nurse has been instructed to stay. Even the youngest Trastámara should be present for this.\n\n\nFernando sits cross-legged on the floor, still vibrating with energy. Bianca has claimed Lucia's lap, her embroidery frame clutched to her chest like a talisman. And Catalina—Catalina sits slightly apart, her knees drawn up, her expression still soft and open in a way you have not seen in years.\n\n\n\nFernando speaks first. Of course he does—he cannot contain himself.\n\n\n\"Did you see me, Catalina? Did you see the jump? The big one that even the knights don't take?\"\n\n\nCatalina nods slowly. \"I heard about it. Everyone was talking about it when I came back to the hall.\"\n\n\n\"Don Rodrigo Manrique kneeled to me,\" Fernando says, the wonder still fresh in his voice. \"He said... he said I could command cavalry. That there's more than one way to lead men in war.\" He looks at you, seeking confirmation. \"Is that true, Papa? Can I really be a soldier even if I can't...\"\n\n\nHe trails off, the old shame flickering.\n\n\n\"You can be more than a soldier,\" you say. \"You can be a general. The man who sees the whole battlefield. The man who knows where to send the charge that breaks the enemy.\"\n\n\nFernando's face lights up. He turns to his sisters. \"I was so scared this morning. When the Count asked about swords. I thought... I thought everyone would know I was broken.\"\n\n\n\"You're not broken,\" Catalina says quietly. \"You're just... different. Like me.\"\n\n\n\nBianca tugs at Lucia's sleeve. \"Tell them about the Duchess, Mama. Tell them what she said.\"\n\n\nLucia smiles. \"Why don't you tell them, piccola?\"\n\n\nBianca squirms with pleasure and turns to face her siblings, her volatile energy channeled into storytelling.\n\n\n\"I hit her,\" she announces. \"This morning. The Duchess. She tried to grab my face and I hit her hand.\"\n\n\nFernando's eyes go wide. \"You hit a Duchess?\"\n\n\n\"She grabbed me! I didn't like it.\" Bianca's lower lip juts out, the old defiance surfacing. But then she softens. \"But then Papa said something to her, and she wasn't angry. And then Mama took me away and I got my embroidery and...\"\n\n\nShe holds up the frame, showing the half-finished birds.\n\n\n\"The Duchess came to see me later. And she said my stitches were the finest she'd seen from anyone under ten. And she said...\" Bianca scrunches her face, trying to remember the exact words. \"She said I don't like to be admired. I like to be useful.\" She looks up at Lucia. \"What does that mean, Mama?\"\n\n\n\"It means,\" Lucia says gently, \"that you would rather show people what you can do than have them tell you how pretty you are.\"\n\n\nBianca considers this. \"Yes,\" she decides. \"That's right. I don't like when people just look at me. I like when they look at what I make.\"\n\n\n\nA silence falls. Fernando and Bianca both turn to Catalina, waiting.\n\n\nShe has been quiet, watching her siblings with those grey-green eyes. The openness from the great hall is still there, but fragile—like morning frost that might melt at a touch.\n\n\n\"Catalina sang,\" Fernando says to Bianca, in the tone of someone sharing a secret. \"In front of everyone. And people cried.\"\n\n\n\"I know,\" Bianca says. \"I heard the Te Deum from the other room. It was very loud.\"\n\n\nCatalina pulls her knees closer to her chest.\n\n\n\"I didn't think I could do it,\" she says, her voice small. \"This morning, when I talked to the Bishop, I felt... nothing. He blessed me and I felt nothing. I thought there was something wrong with me. That I was empty inside.\"\n\n\nShe looks at you.\n\n\n\"But then Papa came and talked to me. About the stars. About Mama.\" Her voice wavers. \"And he said... he said I could show people what they should feel, even if I didn't feel it myself. Like when we talked to Mama in heaven.\"\n\n\nFernando and Bianca are utterly still, sensing the weight of the moment.\n\n\n\"So when I went out to sing, I tried to remember. The stars. Mama's face in the painting. The way it felt when we cried together, Papa.\" A tear traces down her cheek. \"And then... and then I wasn't pretending anymore. I was really singing to her. To Mama. And I...\"\n\n\nShe stops. Her shoulders shake.\n\n\n\"I saw her,\" she whispers. \"While I was singing. Just for a moment. She was in the light, and she was smiling, and she said she was proud of me.\"\n\n\nFernando moves without thinking, crossing the space between them and wrapping his arms around his sister. Bianca scrambles off Lucia's lap and joins the embrace, her small arms barely reaching around both siblings.\n\n\nCatalina cries. Not the controlled, careful tears of a princess protecting herself, but the deep, heaving sobs of a child who has finally let herself grieve.\n\n\n\nLucia's hand tightens on your arm. When you look at her, her eyes are glistening.\n\n\n\"I never knew her,\" she murmurs, too soft for the children to hear. \"But I love her. Because she gave you these children. And because some part of her is still watching over them.\"\n\n\nTeresa, nearly four, has woken up enough to be confused by all the crying. She toddles over to the pile of siblings and pats Catalina's head with clumsy tenderness.\n\n\n\"Don't be sad, Cata,\" she says. \"It's okay.\"\n\n\nThis, somehow, makes Catalina laugh through her tears. She pulls Teresa into the embrace, and now four children are tangled together on the floor of the solar—the heir who cannot fight, the beauty who cannot be touched, the genius who could not feel, and the little one who does not yet understand any of it but knows that hugs help.\n\n\nLittle Juana, two and a half, sees the pile and decides she must be part of it. She launches herself from her cushion with a determined grunt and lands on top of her siblings, prompting a chorus of \"oof!\" and surprised laughter.\n\n\nEven baby Nicolás stirs in his nurse's arms, as if sensing he is missing something important.\n\n\n\nThe fire crackles. The candles burn low. Five children—six, counting the sleeping infant—are tangled together in a heap of limbs and laughter and tears.\n\n\nYou look at Lucia. She looks at you.\n\n\n\"This,\" she says softly. \"This is what we're fighting for. Not crowns. Not empire. This.\"\n\n\nShe leans her head against your shoulder.\n\n\n\"They will remember this night, Juan. When they are old and we are gone, they will remember the night after the Cortes, when they held each other and cried and laughed and were just... children. Together.\"\n\n\nThe children are separating now, finding their own spaces again, wiping eyes and giggling at nothing. Fernando is telling Bianca about the horse, how it felt to fly over the jump. Catalina is braiding Teresa's hair with absent fingers. Juana has fallen asleep again, sprawled across Catalina's lap.\n\n\nAnd you sit in your chair, the King of Castile and León, of Aragón, of Naples and Sicily, Defender of Romania, builder of empires and commander of armies—watching your children be children, and feeling, for this one quiet moment, that you have everything that matters."

He's preparing them for his upcoming journey to Florence to establish banking arrangements with the Medici. This is a tender scene where Juan, the father, is speaking to his children about duty and his upcoming absence.\n\nI should write this scene with warmth and intimacy, showing the children's reactions and questions. The children range from nearly 7 (Catalina) down to baby Nicolás (not yet 2). The older ones - Catalina (7), Fernando (nearly 6), and Bianca (nearly 5) - can understand and respond. Teresa (nearly 4) and Juana (2.5) might have simpler reactions. Nicolás is an infant.\n\nI'll write the scene showing the children settling around Lucia, their reactions to Juan's words about duty and his upcoming journey, and let the scene breathe with the intimacy of a family moment after an emotionally intense day.\n\n\nThe children move like a small flock of birds, responding to your gentle herding. Blankets are gathered, pillows rearranged. Lucia shifts to make room, and soon she is surrounded—Nicolás settled drowsily in her lap, Juana curled against her side already half-asleep, Teresa wedged between her mother and Bianca.\n\n\nFernando claims a spot at Lucia's feet, leaning back against her legs. Catalina hesitates for a moment—she is seven, nearly too old for such things, her dignity usually requires—but then she sees the space beside you and settles there, close enough that her shoulder touches your arm.\n\n\nThe fire paints them all in warm gold. Lucia looks like a Madonna from one of the Italian paintings she loves, surrounded by children, her face soft in the flickering light.\n\n\nThe older three watch you with attentive eyes. They sense this is important—not a bedtime story, but something real.\n\n\n\nFernando speaks first, as he often does.\n\n\n\"How many days, Papa? How long will you be gone?\"\n\n\n\"Several weeks,\" you say. \"Perhaps two months, if the seas are kind. I must sail to Italy, to a city called Florence.\"\n\n\n\"Florence,\" Catalina repeats quietly. She knows her geography. \"That's where the Medici are. The bankers.\"\n\n\nBianca's nose wrinkles. \"What's a banker?\"\n\n\n\"A banker is someone who keeps money safe,\" Lucia explains gently, \"and helps it move from place to place. When Papa needs to pay soldiers in Constantinople, he cannot carry chests of gold across the sea. The bankers help.\"\n\n\n\"Oh.\" Bianca considers this. \"That sounds boring.\"\n\n\nFernando grins, but his smile fades quickly. \"Will it be dangerous, Papa? The journey?\"\n\n\nTeresa, not quite following, picks up on her brother's worry. \"Papa going away?\"\n\n\n\"Just for a little while, cariño,\" Lucia soothes, stroking her hair.\n\n\nCatalina is quiet, watching you. After today—after the stars, after the song, after seeing her mother in the light—there is something different in her gaze. Less guarded. More searching.\n\n\n\"You said we did a task for the kingdom today,\" she says. \"Is that why you're telling us this? Because we're old enough now to understand?\""

The children should react authentically to their ages and personalities:\n\n- Catalina (7): Brilliant, just had an emotional breakthrough, will understand intellectually and emotionally\n- Fernando (nearly 6): Bold, wants to be helpful, might offer to come or protect the family\n- Bianca (nearly 5): Volatile but devout, might get upset or cling\n- Teresa (nearly 4): Too young to fully understand but picks up on emotions\n- Juana (2.5): Very young, might not understand at all\n- Nicolás (not yet 2): Baby, asleep or drowsy\n\nThis should be a warm, bittersweet scene. The children processing that Papa must leave. Lucia being supportive. The weight of kingship versus the love of family.\n\nI should not make this too long - let the player continue to guide the scene. End with an opportunity for Juan to continue speaking or for the children to respond.\n\n\nCatalina comes into your arms easily—more easily than she has in years. She is seven, long-limbed and growing, but she curls against your chest like the small child she still is. Her head tucks beneath your chin. You can feel her breathing, feel the slight hitch in her breath as she processes your words.\n\n\nThe other children watch. The fire crackles.\n\n\n\"I don't want you to go,\" Catalina whispers against your chest. It is not a demand, not a tantrum. Just truth, spoken softly.\n\n\nFernando's jaw tightens. He is trying to be brave—trying to be the prince, the heir, the man of the house. But he is not yet six years old, and his father is leaving.\n\n\n\"Who will protect us while you're gone?\" he asks. His voice is steady, but his hands grip the edge of the blanket.\n\n\n\"Your mother,\" you say. \"And Don Álvaro. And the guards. And all the good men who serve this house.\"\n\n\n\"But not you.\" It is not an accusation. Just a fact he is trying to accept.\n\n\nBianca's lower lip trembles. The volatile temper that flared this morning now threatens to tip the other direction—toward tears, toward clinging. She presses closer to Lucia, her embroidery frame forgotten.\n\n\n\"Will you come back?\" she asks, her voice very small. \"Promise you'll come back?\"\n\n\nLucia's hand finds Bianca's hair, stroking gently. Her eyes meet yours over the children's heads. There is pain there—she knows the dangers of sea voyages, of foreign courts, of a world that does not always let kings return to their families.\n\n\nTeresa, not fully understanding, has picked up on the mood. Her small face crumples.\n\n\n\"Papa sad?\" she asks. \"Why Papa sad?\"\n\n\nJuana stirs against Lucia's side, making a small sound of protest at all the emotion disturbing her sleep.\n\n\nAnd Catalina, still pressed against your chest, says quietly:\n\n\n\"It's like when Mama went away. Except you're choosing to go.\"\n\n\nThere is no accusation in her voice. She is simply trying to understand—how duty and love can pull in opposite directions, how a father who loves his children can still leave them."

I promise I will come back.\"\n\n\n\"But it will take forever,\" she sobs. \"I'll be five when you come back. I'll be old.\"\n\n\nDespite everything, Fernando almost smiles at this. Almost.\n\n\nTeresa has given up trying to understand. She simply crawls across the blankets to you and Catalina, pushing her way into the embrace.\n\n\n\"Papa stay,\" she declares firmly, as if the matter is now settled.\n\n\nCatalina is quiet for a long moment. Then she asks the question that proves she is her father's daughter:\n\n\n\"Why Hungary and Poland, Papa? What's there that matters so much?\""

The infant Ladislaus (Posthumous) - supported by Elisabeth and Austrian/German factions\n  2. Władysław III of Poland - supported by Hungarian nobles who wanted an adult king to fight the Ottomans\n\nThe Hungarian nobles were divided. Some supported the infant heir, others wanted Władysław III because they needed an adult king who could lead armies against the Ottoman threat.\n\nIn the game timeline, it's now Spring/Summer 1439. King Albert died in autumn 1438 according to Chapter 2.52. So the succession crisis should be ongoing or recently resolved.\n\nLet me draft a d100 table to determine how the succession played out:\n\nKey factors:\n- Queen Elisabeth was pregnant when Albert died\n- The child could be male or female\n- If male, there's a legitimate heir but he's an infant\n- Hungarian nobles might prefer Władysław III (adult, military leader) vs infant\n- Elisabeth might fight for her child's rights\n- The Ottoman threat makes an adult king more attractive\n\n\n- Władysław III of Poland was a strong contender with significant support from Hungarian nobles seeking military leadership against the Ottomans\n\n\nPreparations for the Grand Embassy\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna nods as you outline your requirements. \"Five hundred men is a significant escort, Your Majesty—enough to demonstrate royal dignity without appearing to invade our allies.

When King Albert died last autumn, Queen Elisabeth was with child. The nobles were divided—some wished to wait for the birth, others demanded an adult king immediately given the Ottoman threat. We have received conflicting reports since then.\"\n\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\n\"Shall I summarize what we know? Or would Your Majesty prefer to receive fresh intelligence before departing?\"\n\n\n\nThe Hungarian Succession Crisis\n\n\nBackground:\n\n\nKing Albert II of Habsburg, King of Hungary and Bohemia, died in October 1438 during a campaign against the Ottomans. His widow, Queen Elisabeth of Luxembourg, was pregnant at the time of his death. The Hungarian nobility faced a choice:\n\n\nWait for Elisabeth's child — if male, Hungary would have a legitimate heir, but an infant king during an Ottoman crisis\n\nElect Władysław III of Poland — an adult king, sixteen years old, who could lead armies immediately, but setting aside the Habsburg claim\n\n\nThe question was further complicated by:\n\n\nElisabeth's fierce determination to secure her child's inheritance\n\nThe Hungarian magnates' factionalism (some loyal to the Habsburgs, others seeking Polish alliance)\n\nBohemia's separate succession (also claimed through Albert)\n\nThe Ottoman pressure making military leadership urgent\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors (for a clean resolution favoring Władysław):\n\n\nThe Ottoman threat demands an adult military leader\n\nWładysław is young, vigorous, and already proven in Poland\n\nA Polish-Hungarian union creates a powerful bloc against the Ottomans\n\nMany Hungarian nobles preferred election over hereditary succession\n\nJuan's earlier diplomatic contacts may have influenced events\n\n\nFailure Factors (for a clean resolution):\n\n\nElisabeth is daughter of Emperor Sigismund—prestigious bloodline\n\nIf she bore a son, legitimists would have a clear heir\n\nHabsburg connections in Austria and Bohemia support her claim\n\nSome Hungarian magnates distrust Polish dominance\n\nCivil war is always possible when succession is contested\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nCivil War Raging. Elisabeth bore a son (Ladislaus \"Posthumous\") in February 1439. She refused to yield, had the infant crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary, and fled to Austria with both child and crown. Władysław was elected by a rival faction and also crowned—with a hastily made substitute crown. Hungary is now split between two kings, two factions, armies clashing across the countryside. The country Juan hoped would anchor his alliance is tearing itself apart. No coherent partner exists for negotiations.\n11-25\nHostile Stalemate. Elisabeth's son was born and lives. Władysław was elected but Elisabeth holds key fortresses and Austrian support. Neither side has won; neither will yield. The Hungarian magnates are paralyzed, some supporting each claimant. Władysław controls the east and the border with the Ottomans; Elisabeth's faction holds the west and the connection to Austria. Juan will find two courts, two claims, and no clear path to alliance.\n26-40\nWładysław Ascendant, Elisabeth Defiant. Władysław has been crowned and controls most of Hungary, but Elisabeth—with her infant son—remains in Austria under Habsburg protection, refusing to recognize his election. She still holds the authentic Holy Crown, smuggled out of the country. Władysław's position is strong but not secure; he must watch his back while facing the Ottomans. He will be eager for allies but distracted by the unresolved succession.\n41-55\nFragile Unity Under Władysław. Elisabeth bore a daughter, not a son. With no male heir, her claim collapsed. Władysław was elected and crowned without serious opposition. However, Elisabeth's Austrian relatives are displeased, and some Hungarian magnates accepted the result grudgingly. The kingdom is united in name but fractured in loyalty. Władysław rules, but carefully. He needs foreign support to consolidate his position.\n56-70\nWładysław Secure. Elisabeth's child—a son—was born sickly and died within weeks. The succession crisis resolved itself through tragedy. Władysław was elected unanimously and crowned with the Holy Crown. Elisabeth, grief-stricken, has withdrawn to Austria and poses no further threat. Hungary is united under a young, energetic king who is already turning his attention to the Ottoman frontier. He will welcome Juan's embassy warmly.\n71-85\nStrong Polish-Hungarian Union. Elisabeth bore a daughter, and the Hungarian magnates moved quickly to elect Władysław before any complications arose. The young king has proven himself capable in his first months—reorganizing the army, securing the loyalty of key nobles, opening negotiations with Balkan princes. Hungary and Poland together represent a formidable power. Władysław is actively seeking allies for an eventual confrontation with the Ottomans. Juan's arrival will be perfectly timed.\n86-95\nWładysław Triumphant. Not only has Władysław secured Hungary, but he has done so with remarkable skill for a seventeen-year-old. Elisabeth's son died in infancy; Elisabeth herself has accepted a generous settlement and retired to Austria. The Hungarian magnates are united behind their new king. Władysław has already begun military reforms and has sent envoys to Venice, the Papacy, and—notably—to Castile, seeking the famous Defensor Romaniae. Juan's embassy arrives to find an eager partner who has been hoping for exactly this contact.\n96-100\nA Ready Alliance. Everything has aligned. Władysław rules both Poland and Hungary with firm hands. Elisabeth's claim evaporated—her child was stillborn, and she has entered a convent in grief. The Hungarian and Polish nobles, initially suspicious of union, have discovered its benefits: shared resources, coordinated defense, a king who moves between both realms binding them together. Władysław has already declared his intention to challenge the Ottomans and has been actively seeking a coalition. When Juan's messengers arrive announcing the King of Castile's embassy, Władysław reportedly says: \"God has answered our prayers. The Defender of Romania comes to us.\" The ground for alliance has already been prepared.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

King Albert II of Habsburg died in October 1439 (not 1438 - I need to check this), leaving his wife Elisabeth of Luxembourg pregnant.\n\n2. Elisabeth gave birth to a son, Ladislaus Posthumus (Ladislaus V), in February 1440.\n\n3. The Hungarian nobility was divided. Some wanted to wait for Elisabeth's child, others wanted an adult king to face the Ottoman threat.\n\n4. A faction of Hungarian nobles elected Władysław III of Poland as King of Hungary in 1440.\n\n5. Elisabeth had her infant son Ladislaus crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary, which she had stolen/smuggled with the help of her lady-in-waiting.\n\n6. So there were TWO crowned kings - Władysław III (crowned with a substitute crown) and the infant Ladislaus V (crowned with the real Holy Crown).\n\n7. Civil war ensued between the two factions.\n\n8. Władysław III eventually gained the upper hand in Hungary, but the situation was never fully resolved.\n\n9. In 1444, Władysław III led a crusade against the Ottomans (the Crusade of Varna), which ended in disaster. Władysław was killed at the Battle of Varna on November 10, 1444.\n\n10. After Władysław's death, the infant Ladislaus V was eventually recognized as King of Hungary (he was already King of Bohemia and Duke of Austria).\n\nSo historically, the outcome was more like the 1-10 or 11-25 result - a civil war with two crowned kings, a divided country, and a messy situation. It was NOT a clean resolution.\n\nThe user is correct to question this. The 96-100 result (everything aligned perfectly, Elisabeth's child stillborn, etc.) is NOT what happened historically. What happened was much messier - civil war, two kings, divided loyalties.\n\n\nThe historical outcome devastated Christian resistance against the Ottoman Empire. The internal conflict and Władysław's death at Varna critically undermined any unified Christian response to Ottoman expansion. The competing royal claims and subsequent chaos left Hungary vulnerable, effectively weakening the entire region's ability to mount an effective defense against the growing Ottoman threat.\n\n\nYou raise an excellent point, and I need to correct myself.\n\n\nWhat Actually Happened Historically:\n\n\nNo—the historical outcome was actually closer to the 1-10 result. It was a disaster:\n\n\nElisabeth bore a son, Ladislaus \"Posthumous,\" in February 1440\n\nElisabeth, fiercely determined, had her infant crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary—which she had smuggled out of its vault with the help of a lady-in-waiting\n\nMeanwhile, the Hungarian magnates who wanted an adult king elected Władysław III of Poland and crowned him with a hastily made substitute crown\n\nHungary had two crowned kings—an infant with the legitimate crown in Austria, and a teenager with a fake crown actually in Hungary\n\nCivil war broke out between the factions\n\nThe situation was never fully resolved before Władysław marched off on the Crusade of Varna in 1444\n\nWładysław was killed at the Battle of Varna—a catastrophic defeat that shattered the Christian coalition\n\nAfter his death, the infant Ladislaus Posthumous was eventually recognized, but by then Hungary was weakened and divided\n\n\nSo historically, the succession crisis was a catastrophe that crippled the very alliance that might have stopped the Ottomans. The clean, favorable outcomes at the top of my table represent what could have happened with extraordinary luck—not what actually occurred.\n\n\nShall I adjust the table, or does this context help you decide how to proceed with the roll?"

But in this alternate timeline, things have gone much better.\n\nLet me write out what this means for Juan's upcoming embassy. The 86-95 result states:\n\n\"Władysław Triumphant. Not only has Władysław secured Hungary, but he has done so with remarkable skill for a seventeen-year-old.

Juan's embassy arrives to find an eager partner who has been hoping for exactly this contact.\"\n\nThis is a fantastic outcome for Juan's plans. The timing is 1439, so Władysław would be about 15-16 years old (he was born in 1424). Let me check - actually by 1439 he'd be about 15. But in the result I wrote he's described as 17, so let me adjust slightly or acknowledge he's young but capable.\n\nActually, let me recalculate: Władysław III was born October 31, 1424. In 1439, he would be 14-15 years old. That's very young. But historically he did become King of Poland in 1434 at age 10, and was elected King of Hungary in 1440 at age 15-16. So by 1439, he's been King of Poland for 5 years already (with regents, but still).\n\nI should write an exciting response about this fortunate turn of events and what it means for Juan's embassy.\n\n\nWładysław Triumphant\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna receives the latest dispatches from the East and reads them with visible relief.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, the news from Hungary is... remarkably good.\"\n\n\nHe spreads the reports on the table.\n\n\n\"Queen Elisabeth bore a son in February—Ladislaus, they named him. For a few weeks, it seemed the kingdom would tear itself apart. Elisabeth was determined to see her child crowned, and many magnates supported her. But then...\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"The infant sickened. A fever, the reports say. He did not survive his first month.\"\n\n\nA moment of silence for a child who never had a chance to live.\n\n\n\"Elisabeth was devastated. The Habsburg faction, suddenly without a candidate, collapsed. The magnates moved swiftly—Władysław of Poland was elected by near-unanimous acclaim and crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Székesfehérvár.

Some say she intends to take the veil.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down the dispatch.\n\n\n\"The result is... extraordinary. Władysław—he is only fifteen, Your Majesty, but by all accounts he has the wisdom of a man twice his age. He has spent five years as King of Poland already, learning statecraft. Now he commands both crowns.

When your messengers arrive announcing your intention to visit, I suspect the reception will be... enthusiastic.\"\n\n\nHe looks at the map still spread on the floor from your conversation with the children.\n\n\n\"Poland and Hungary united under one crown. The largest military force in Eastern Europe, commanded by a young king eager to prove himself against the Ottomans.\" His finger traces the line from Castile to Constantinople. \"Your Majesty, the alliance you envisioned—it may be more achievable than any of us dared hope.\""

Let me piece together what I know from the search results:\n\n1. The academy was established in February 1432 (from Book_1_Complete_Chronicle)\n2. It's led by Sir Thomas Beaumont\n3. In Chapter 2.13, it had 47 students enrolled\n4. By the 1438 muster, they had 43 graduates plus 22 senior cadets (65 total academy-trained personnel)\n5. The academy has been running for about 7 years now (1432-1439)\n\nSo the academy has been operational for 7 years and has produced multiple classes of officers. Let me calculate:\n- Year 1 (1432-1433): 15 graduates (mentioned in Book 1)\n- Subsequent years would have produced more\n\nBy 1438, they had 43 graduates total plus 22 senior cadets. By 1439, they would have more.\n\nI should narrate Juan visiting the academy and getting a report from Sir Thomas Beaumont on the current state of officer training.\n\n\nThe Royal Military Academy, Toledo\n\n\nEarly July 1439\n\n\nThe former Monastery of San Clemente has been transformed over seven years. What was once a place of quiet contemplation is now alive with the sounds of drilling men, the clash of practice weapons, and the sharp commands of instructors in multiple languages.\n\n\nYou find Sir Thomas Beaumont in the central courtyard, observing a group of cadets practicing formation changes. The English knight has aged since you first brought him to Castile—his hair more grey than brown now, his face weathered by years of training young men for war. But his eyes remain sharp, and he moves with the easy confidence of a man who knows his craft.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He bows, then gestures at the drilling cadets. \"The class of 1440. They'll graduate next spring.\"\n\n\nYou walk together through the academy grounds as Beaumont provides his report.\n\n\n\nSeven Years of Officers\n\n\n\"We've graduated sixty-eight officers since the academy opened,\" Beaumont says, consulting a leather-bound ledger he carries always. \"Plus we have twenty-four senior cadets who will complete their training within the year.\"\n\n\nHe ticks off the numbers:\n\nYear\nGraduates\nNotes\n1433\n15\nFirst class—proof of concept\n1434\n12\nRefined curriculum\n1435\n10\nSeveral deployed to Constantinople\n1436\n9\nSmaller class, higher standards\n1437\n11\nFirst graduates returning as instructors\n1438\n11\nDeployed across imperial muster\nTotal\n68\nPlus 24 current senior cadets\n\n\"Of those sixty-eight, twelve are now serving in Constantinople—training the militia, advising on fortifications, learning Ottoman tactics firsthand. Eight more are with the Military Orders, helping modernize their training. Six have been assigned to the Crown Marshalls as tactical advisors.\" He pauses. \"Three have died—two in Constantinople during a skirmish, one to fever in Naples.\"\n\n\n\"And the rest?\"\n\n\n\"Scattered across the empire. Garrison commanders. Training officers for regional militias. Four are here as instructors—men who graduated in '33 and '34, now teaching what they learned in the field.\"\n\n\n\nThe Curriculum\n\n\nBeaumont leads you into the main hall, where maps cover the walls—the Mediterranean, the Balkans, Anatolia, the approaches to Constantinople.\n\n\n\"We've evolved considerably since the early days,\" he says. \"The first year was chaos—Hungarians and Italians and Germans all convinced their way was the only way. Now we've synthesized.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to a diagram showing the three training streams:\n\n\nStream One: Cavalry and Mobile Warfare\n\n\nHeavy cavalry shock tactics (German tradition)\n\nLight cavalry scouting and harassment (Hungarian tradition)\n\nCombined arms coordination\n\nTerrain assessment and exploitation\n\n\nStream Two: Infantry and Siege\n\n\nPike and crossbow formations (Swiss and Italian influence)\n\nDefensive positions and fortification\n\nSiege craft—both attack and defense\n\nUrban warfare (lessons from Granada)\n\n\nStream Three: Artillery and Engineering\n\n\nGunpowder weapons employment\n\nField fortification\n\nBridge-building and obstacle crossing\n\nSupply and logistics\n\n\n\"Every cadet rotates through all three streams,\" Beaumont explains. \"We don't produce specialists—we produce commanders who understand how all the pieces fit together.\"\n\n\n\nThe Ottoman Question\n\n\nYou pause before a detailed map of Ottoman military dispositions—information gathered from Hunyadi's correspondence, merchant reports, and the observations of your knights in Constantinople.\n\n\n\"What do your graduates understand about fighting the Turks?\"\n\n\nBeaumont's expression grows serious.\n\n\n\"More than any Christian officers outside Hungary, Your Majesty. Hunyadi's letters have been invaluable. The men we sent to Constantinople have seen Ottoman tactics firsthand and reported back.\" He points to the map. \"We understand their sipahi cavalry, their janissary infantry, their use of artillery. We've studied their logistics, their discipline, their chain of command.\"\n\n\nHe turns to face you directly.\n\n\n\"Our officers won't be surprised by what they face. They won't make the mistakes the crusaders made at Nicopolis—charging blindly into prepared positions, ignoring terrain, underestimating their enemy.\" A pause. \"Whether that's enough to win... that depends on numbers, on allies, on a thousand things no academy can control.\"\n\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\n\"Seven years ago,\" Beaumont says as you complete your tour, \"I told Your Majesty that I could train officers superior to any in Christendom—except the Ottomans—within three to five years.\"\n\n\nHe stops in the courtyard, watching a group of cadets practice mounted archery—a skill borrowed from Hungarian tradition.\n\n\n\"I believe we've achieved that. Our graduates understand combined arms. They can read terrain. They know how to keep men fed and supplied on campaign. They've studied every major battle of the past century.\" He meets your eyes. \"They're not veterans—many haven't seen real combat. But they're prepared for it in ways that most Christian armies are not.\"\n\n\nHe gestures at the academy around him.\n\n\n\"What we've built here, Your Majesty—it didn't exist anywhere in Christendom seven years ago. France trains knights. Italy trains condottieri. Germany trains heavy cavalry. We train commanders. Men who can take a mixed force of cavalry, infantry, and guns and make them work together.\"\n\n\nA cadet runs past, late for a lecture on siege engineering.\n\n\n\"When the war with the Ottomans comes,\" Beaumont says quietly, \"your officers will be ready. Whether Christendom provides enough men for them to lead... that's another question.\""

      "say": "Thought process: Acknowledged correction and weighed academy's theoretical readiness against untested doctrine.\n\nThe user is absolutely right. I made an error - there's a truce with the Ottomans since 1435 (expiring 1445), so there shouldn't be any skirmishes or deaths from fighting Ottomans. The knights in Constantinople are defending walls and training militia, but they're not actually fighting Ottoman forces.\n\nThis means:\n1. No one has died in \"skirmishes\" with Ottomans\n2. The academy's knowledge of Ottoman tactics is entirely theoretical - from Hunyadi's letters, merchant reports, historical accounts, but NO firsthand experience\n3. The real test of whether the training works has never been tried\n\nThis is a significant limitation. Let me draft a d100 table to determine how effective the academy has actually been at preparing officers to fight an enemy they've never faced.\n\nSuccess factors:\n- Hunyadi's detailed correspondence about Ottoman tactics\n- Seven years of institutional development\n- International faculty with diverse experience\n- Systematic approach to combined arms\n- Some graduates stationed in Constantinople can observe Ottoman military (from a distance, during truce)\n- Access to accounts from Nicopolis survivors, other historical battles\n- Good theoretical foundation\n\nFailure factors:\n- No actual combat experience against Ottomans\n- Theory vs. practice gap - untested doctrines\n- May have developed wrong conclusions from secondhand information\n- Hunyadi himself hasn't fought Ottomans recently (truce applies to Hungary too?)\n- Cultural/linguistic barriers to understanding Ottoman military culture\n- Overconfidence from lack of reality check\n- Training against what they THINK Ottomans fight like, which may be outdated or wrong\n- No veterans with fresh Ottoman combat experience to correct mistakes\n\n\nYou are absolutely correct. I apologize for the error—with the truce in effect since 1435, there have been no skirmishes, no deaths from Ottoman combat, and critically, no firsthand experience of Ottoman tactics. The academy's knowledge is entirely theoretical: Hunyadi's letters, merchant reports, historical accounts from Nicopolis and earlier battles, and distant observation from Constantinople's walls.\n\n\nThis is a significant limitation that deserves proper examination.\n\n\n\nAcademy Effectiveness: Training for an Enemy Never Faced\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nSeven years of institutional development and refinement\n\nHunyadi's detailed correspondence on Ottoman tactics, organization, and doctrine\n\nInternational faculty bringing diverse military traditions\n\nSystematic combined-arms approach rare in Christendom\n\nGraduates in Constantinople can observe Ottoman military movements from a distance\n\nAccess to survivors' accounts from Nicopolis, Varna (in standard history), other battles\n\nStrong theoretical foundation in logistics, terrain, and coordination\n\nDiscipline and professionalism instilled in graduates\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nZero actual combat experience against Ottoman forces\n\nTheory-practice gap: untested doctrines may contain fatal flaws\n\nSecondhand information may be outdated, incomplete, or misunderstood\n\nHunyadi's letters describe what he saw—not necessarily what the Ottomans do now\n\nOttoman military evolves; tactics from 1430 may not match 1445\n\nNo feedback loop: mistakes in training aren't corrected by battlefield reality\n\nRisk of overconfidence from academic success without combat validation\n\nCultural blind spots—understanding how Ottomans fight is not understanding why\n\nJanissary infantry and sipahi cavalry coordination may be underestimated\n\nOttoman artillery development may have advanced beyond reports\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nDangerously Overconfident. The academy has produced officers who believe they understand Ottoman warfare but have developed fundamentally flawed doctrine. Key misunderstandings—about janissary discipline, sipahi mobility, Ottoman artillery integration—have been institutionalized and taught as fact. Worse, seven years of academic success has bred arrogance. When these officers face real Ottomans, they will be shocked by how wrong their assumptions were. The academy may have made things worse by creating false confidence.\n11-25\nTheoretical but Untested. The academy has produced competent administrators and trainers, but their understanding of Ottoman warfare remains superficial. They know the terminology, the unit types, the famous battles—but lack the intuitive grasp that only combat experience provides. The doctrine developed is reasonable but generic; it would work against any disciplined enemy, not specifically against Ottoman strengths and weaknesses. First real engagement will be a harsh learning experience.\n26-40\nMixed Foundation. Some elements of the training are excellent—logistics, march discipline, combined arms coordination. But Ottoman-specific preparation is inconsistent. Some instructors have extrapolated wisely from Hunyadi's letters; others have filled gaps with assumptions that may prove wrong. Graduates will perform well in areas of general competence but may be surprised by Ottoman-specific tactics. The academy needs combat veterans to identify and correct its blind spots.\n41-55\nSolid Theoretical Preparation. The academy has done the best possible job given its limitations. Hunyadi's correspondence has been carefully studied; plausible counter-tactics developed; weaknesses identified. Officers understand they are working from theory and have been taught to adapt when reality differs from expectation. They won't be surprised by Ottoman capabilities—but they also haven't internalized responses through drill and experience. First battles will test whether theory translates to practice.\n56-70\nStrong Foundation, Known Gaps. Beaumont and his faculty have been intellectually honest about what they know and don't know. Officers graduate understanding Ottoman military organization, standard tactics, and historical patterns—while also knowing these are secondhand. A culture of adaptation has been instilled: \"The map is not the territory.\" When these officers face real Ottomans, they will adjust quickly because they expect to adjust. The doctrine is sound enough to survive first contact.\n71-85\nExcellent Theoretical Mastery. Through careful synthesis of all available sources—Hunyadi's letters, merchant reports, Byzantine military manuals, accounts from Greek refugees who served under Ottoman rule—the academy has developed a remarkably accurate picture of Ottoman warfare. Officers can discuss janissary tactics, sipahi doctrine, and Ottoman siege craft with genuine understanding. They lack only the combat experience to make this knowledge instinctive. Given any battlefield exposure, these officers will learn faster than any in Christendom.\n86-95\nNear-Optimal Preparation. The academy has achieved something remarkable: officers who understand Ottoman warfare as well as anyone can without having fought them. Key innovations include war-gaming exercises simulating Ottoman tactics, with some instructors playing the Ottoman role based on Hunyadi's detailed descriptions. Officers have practiced responding to feigned retreats, janissary volley fire, and sipahi encirclement—in theory. Whether theory holds in practice remains to be seen, but no academy in Christendom has prepared its officers better for this specific enemy.\n96-100\nUnexpected Advantage. A stroke of fortune has supplemented the academy's theoretical work. Perhaps a former janissary convert has found his way to Toledo and shared insider knowledge. Perhaps a Greek military scholar with access to Byzantine intelligence archives has joined the faculty. Perhaps Hunyadi himself visited and spent months correcting misconceptions. Whatever the cause, the academy possesses insights into Ottoman warfare that go beyond what secondhand sources should provide. Officers graduate with understanding that would typically require years of frontier warfare to acquire. The gap between theory and practice has been narrowed as much as humanly possible without actual combat.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

In the 15th century, it was a base for Barbary pirates/corsairs. Juan has previously discussed dealing with piracy from places like Salé, and Tetouan would be another such target.\n\nI need to:\n1.

Present the military situation regarding Tetouan\n\nLet me search for any previous mentions of Tetouan or related North African operations in the project files.\n\n\nThe Academy's Limitation\n\n\nBeaumont's confidence falters slightly when you press him on specifics.\n\n\n\"Show me,\" you say. \"Show me how your cadets would respond to a janissary volley followed by sipahi encirclement.\"\n\n\nWhat follows is... instructive. The cadets know the terms. They can describe the tactic. But when Beaumont sets up a practical exercise, the responses are hesitant, textbook, mechanical. They have memorized Hunyadi's descriptions the way a student memorizes scripture—able to recite, unable to truly understand.\n\n\nOne cadet, when challenged, admits: \"We know what the Hungarians say the Ottomans do, Sir Thomas. But we've never seen it. We've never felt the ground shake when sipahi charge. We don't know how fast the janissaries reload, or how their drums sound, or what it's like when arrows darken the sky.\"\n\n\nBeaumont, to his credit, does not make excuses.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty sees the truth of it,\" he says quietly after the exercise. \"We've built something valuable here—officers who understand logistics, coordination, terrain. Against any Christian army, they would perform admirably. But against the Ottomans specifically...\" He shakes his head. \"We're working from letters and books. It's not enough. It can't be enough until they face the real thing.\"\n\n\nA sobering assessment. Your officers are competent professionals—but their Ottoman-specific preparation is superficial. First contact with Turkish forces will be a harsh education.\n\n\nYou file this knowledge away. It will matter when the time comes.\n\n\n\nThe War Council\n\n\nToledo, Early July 1439\n\n\nThe Cortes has barely concluded when you summon the council. Word spreads quickly: the King plans military action. Not against the Ottomans—not yet—but closer to home.\n\n\nThey gather in the war chamber of the Alcázar: maps on the walls, sand tables for tactical planning, the smell of ink and leather and old stone.\n\n\nPresent:\n\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna — Chief Minister\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes — veteran commander, newly reconciled after Fernando's display\n\nDon Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza — Admiral of Castile, recently returned from Burgundy\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont — War Academy commander\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán — Master of Santiago\n\nDon Pedro González de Padilla — Master of Calatrava\n\nDon Gutierre de Sotomayor — Master of Alcántara\n\nCaptain Rodrigo de Mendoza — Crown Soldiers commander\n\nDiego de Daza — for logistics and treasury matters\n\n\nSeveral military-minded nobles from the Cortes have also accepted your invitation—younger sons eager for action, veterans of Granada hungry for purpose.\n\n\n\nTetouan\n\n\nYou gesture to the map of the Strait of Gibraltar and the Moroccan coast.\n\n\n\"Tetouan.\"\n\n\nThe name hangs in the air. The city sits on the Mediterranean coast of Morocco, some forty miles south of Ceuta, nestled in the Rif Mountains. It has been a thorn in Christendom's side for generations.\n\n\nDon Fadrique speaks first, his naval expertise evident.\n\n\n\"Corsair haven, Your Majesty. Not as large as Salé, but more dangerous in some ways—closer to our shipping lanes, better protected by terrain. The Rif tribes shelter it from landward assault. The harbor is shallow but sufficient for their galleys.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique studies the map with a soldier's eye.\n\n\n\"The approach is difficult. Mountains on three sides, the sea on the fourth. A direct assault from the coast would require holding a beachhead while the Riffians gather. An overland march from Ceuta...\" He shakes his head. \"Forty miles through hostile terrain. The Portuguese tried something similar and bled for it.\"\n\n\n\"What forces does Tetouan command?\" you ask.\n\n\nÁlvaro consults his notes. \"Our intelligence suggests the city itself has perhaps two to three thousand fighting men—corsairs, local militia, some professional soldiers in the Marinid sultan's pay. But the greater danger is the Rif tribes. If they unite against an invader, they could field ten thousand or more within a week. Mountain fighters, fierce, knowing every goat path.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago leans forward. \"Why Tetouan specifically, Your Majesty? Salé is the larger threat. Tangier would give us control of the Strait.\"\n\n\n\nThe council waits for your explanation."

They're proposing a naval landing of 10,000 men with cannons to take the city quickly before Rif reinforcements can gather.\n\nLet me think about this strategically from the perspective of the military council:\n\n1. The user mentions they have a \"Muslim vassal with strong claims\" - I should ask who this is, as I don't recall this being established in previous chapters. Let me search for this.\n\n2. The fleet capacity - I need to check what the fleet can actually transport. From the Naval Development Plan, by 1439 they should have significant capacity. Let me recall:\n- Emergency military transport capacity was projected\n- By 1439: ~127 royal fleet ships, ~33 military orders ships = 160 total\n- Emergency lift capacity by 1439 was projected at ~21,055 soldiers\n\nSo 10,000 is within their capacity for a single emergency lift.\n\n3. The tactical question - can they land, take the city with cannons, and hold against Rif counterattack?\n\nThis is a legitimate military planning question. The council should respond with:\n- Questions about the Muslim vassal (who is this?)\n- Assessment of the naval landing feasibility\n- Concerns about the Rif response\n- Cannon effectiveness against Tetouan's fortifications\n- Logistical considerations\n- Strategic implications\n\nLet me have the council members respond in character, raising practical concerns while also engaging with the plan seriously.\n\n\nThe council stirs with interest. A Muslim vassal—this is unexpected, and clever.\n\n\nDon Álvaro raises an eyebrow. \"A Muslim vassal with claims to Tetouan, Your Majesty? I confess I am not aware of this arrangement. Who is this claimant, and how did we come by him?\"\n\n\nBefore you can answer, Don Fadrique is already working through the naval mathematics, his fingers tracing the coastline.\n\n\n\"Ten thousand men...\" He pulls out a small ledger he carries always. \"Our current emergency lift capacity—packing soldiers tightly, minimal equipment, single voyage—is approximately twenty thousand across all available vessels, royal fleet and Military Orders combined. So yes, we can land ten thousand. But that leaves little margin for horses, artillery, supplies, and follow-on reinforcement.\"\n\n\nHe looks up from his calculations.\n\n\n\"If we commit to this, we commit most of our fleet. Nothing else moves—no Constantinople convoys, no Atlantic patrols, no trade protection—until the operation is complete.\"\n\n\n\nThe Tactical Question\n\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont studies the map with professional intensity.\n\n\n\"Cannons change the equation considerably, Your Majesty. Tetouan's walls are not Constantinople's—they're Marinid construction, mud brick and stone, perhaps thirty years old. A proper bombardment with siege guns could breach them within days, not weeks.\"\n\n\nHe traces the harbor approach.\n\n\n\"The question is speed. If we land here—\" he points to the beach north of the city \"—we have perhaps a mile of open ground to cover before we're at the walls. The city garrison of two to three thousand cannot stop ten thousand men in the open. They'll retreat behind their walls and pray the Rif arrive in time.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique picks up the thread, his earlier skepticism giving way to tactical engagement.\n\n\n\"So the race is: can we breach the walls and take the city before ten thousand Riffians descend from the mountains?\" He studies the terrain. \"A week, perhaps? The nearest tribes could gather in three or four days. The more distant ones, another three or four. If we can breach within five days and secure the walls...\"\n\n\n\"The Rif will still come,\" the Master of Calatrava says grimly. \"Even after we take the city. They'll besiege us.\"\n\n\n\"Then we hold the walls against them,\" Don Rodrigo replies. \"Ten thousand men behind stone walls, with cannons, against mountain tribesmen with no siege equipment? That's a siege we win. They'll bleed themselves against us and go home.\"\n\n\n\nThe Vassal Question\n\n\nDon Álvaro returns to his earlier point, his political mind working.\n\n\n\"The vassal is the key, Your Majesty. If we simply conquer Tetouan and garrison it with Christian soldiers, we hold a hostile city in hostile territory—forever bleeding men and gold, hated by every Muslim from Morocco to Egypt. Another Ceuta, at best.\"\n\n\nHe strokes his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\n\"But if we install a Muslim lord with legitimate claim—one who rules in his own name while acknowledging Castilian suzerainty—the calculation changes entirely. The Rif tribes may accept a Muslim ruler where they would never accept a Christian one. The city functions, trades, pays tribute. We gain a ally on the African coast rather than a wound that never heals.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago nods slowly. \"It worked with the taifa kings, in the old days. Christian overlords, Muslim vassals. Granada paid tribute for two centuries before we finally took it.\"\n\n\n\"So,\" Álvaro concludes, \"everything depends on this claimant. Who is he? What is his claim? Will the people of Tetouan accept him? Will the Rif?\"\n\n\n\nThe council turns to you, waiting for answers.\n\n\nThey need to know:\n\n\nWho is this Muslim vassal?\n\nWhat is the nature of his claim to Tetouan?\n\nHow did this arrangement come about?\n\nWhat terms have been discussed?"

I should let them know what I found and ask for clarification about who this claimant is.\n\n\nI have searched the project files extensively, Your Majesty, but I cannot find a record of a specific Muslim claimant to Tetouan that you have been working with.\n\n\nWhat I found:\n\n\nCommander Martín's Mission (1433-1435): He was sent to Morocco with Fernando (the converted qadi) and 22 others to establish intelligence networks in Tangier and Tetouan. The mission had moderate success initially (Roll 71), but later reports showed stagnation (Roll 20)—Morocco's political chaos created caution, not opportunity.\n\nYour Questions to Martín (Chapter 2.32, early 1435): You asked three specific questions:\n\n\nWhat if Castile attacks and sacks Salé?\n\nWhat if Castile takes a port and installs a Muslim vassal with autonomy?\n\nWould port cities accept vassalage under a Muslim ruler from Granada?\n\nResponse Expected: Late April/May 1435\n\n\nHowever, I cannot find a record of Martín's response to these questions, nor any specific claimant being identified.\n\n\n\nPossibilities:\n\n\nThe response was never narrated in a chapter — we may need to roll for what Martín discovered\n\nYou may be thinking of a different conversation — perhaps with Fernando the qadi, or another source\n\nThis claimant is someone you've been developing off-screen — in which case, please tell me who they are\n\n\nCould you clarify who this claimant is? Or shall we roll to determine whether Martín's years in Morocco have identified a suitable candidate with legitimate claims to Tetouan?"

Let me search for this more specifically.\n\n\nTool: Looking for relevant chats in this project...\n\n\nThought process: Located historical agreement details involving exiled family leadership.\n\nI found it! This was in Chapter 2.50. The Banu Rashid - a family of Muslim exiles in Granada who have claims to Tetouan. Let me search for more details about this family and the agreement.\n\nThe key details I found:\n- Ahmad al-Rashid - the elderly patriarch\n- His sons: Khalid, Tariq, Yusuf (scholarly), Omar (youngest, has a nice horse)\n- Three generations in exile from Tetouan\n- Juan sent them gifts: a horse, a book, silk\n- Juan proposed making them *Sahib al-Thaghr* (Lord of the March) of Tetouan\n- They would be Muslim marcher lords under Castilian suzerainty\n- Fernando attended and made a good impression\n- Attack planned for 1439\n- Title grant documents were to be drafted by Álvaro\n\nThis is exactly what Juan is referring to!\n\n\nI found it! Chapter 2.50 - The Banu Rashid.\n\n\n\nYou turn to the assembled council.\n\n\n\"In Chapter Fifty, I received a family of Muslim exiles who have lived in Granada for three generations. The Banu Rashid.\"\n\n\nYou gesture to Álvaro, who nods and picks up the thread.\n\n\n\"Ahmad al-Rashid is the patriarch—a man of perhaps eighty years. His grandfather was expelled from Tetouan generations ago when a rival faction seized power. The family has nursed their claim ever since, waiting for an opportunity.\"\n\n\n\"I sent them gifts before our meeting,\" you continue. \"A horse for their warriors. Silk for their household. And a book—Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah—to show I understood their heritage as men of learning and statecraft, not merely exiled refugees.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique leans forward with interest. \"And they accepted vassalage?\"\n\n\n\"They did. We discussed the arrangement at length. They were cautious—they had questions about territory, about defense, about faith, about guarantees.\" You pause. \"Prince Fernando was present. I asked him to answer their final question: whether having a Muslim vassal would be an embarrassment to a Christian king.\"\n\n\nSeveral eyebrows rise around the table.\n\n\n\"My son told them that people are not embarrassing because of how they pray—they are embarrassing if they break their oaths or act without honor.\" A faint smile. \"He also complimented Omar al-Rashid's horse.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro produces a document from his ever-present stack. \"The title grant was drafted that same day. Sahib al-Thaghr al-Titwan—Lord of the March of Tetouan. The Arabic equivalent of marqués. They rule in their own name, under their own customs and faith, but they hold from the Crown of Castile. They defend the frontier. If threatened, they hold until we arrive.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago strokes his chin. \"And they have been preparing since...?\"\n\n\n\"Since the meeting. Nearly a year now. Ahmad al-Rashid has four sons—Khalid handles finances, Tariq is the military mind, Yusuf is the scholar who understands legal and religious implications, and Omar is young and eager. They have been gathering men from among the Granadan Muslims who wish to return to Africa, preparing for the day we take the city.\"\n\n\nDon Fadrique studies the map with new eyes. \"So we do not simply conquer and garrison. We conquer, install the Rashids, and they govern. The population sees Muslim lords, not Christian occupiers.\"\n\n\n\"Precisely. And the Rif tribes may accept a Sahib al-Thaghr—a lord of the frontier march—where they would never accept a foreign Christian governor.\"\n\n\nThe council's mood has shifted. This is not a blind gamble into hostile territory. This is a prepared operation with local allies waiting.\n\n\n\"The Rashids are ready,\" you conclude. \"They have waited three generations for this moment. Now—how do we give them their city?\""

They've established themselves on the Granada coast facing Morocco and have been building fleets. Let me think about what we know from the project files:\n\nFrom the Royal Naval Development Plan and other documents:\n- Military Orders have been building fleets at Almería\n- Santiago: galleys, based at Almuñécar\n- Calatrava: galleys, naos, transports, based at Almería  \n- Alcántara: galleys, based at Marbella\n- All three have mooring rights at Málaga\n\nBy 1439, according to the naval development plan projections:\n- Santiago: 13 galleys\n- Calatrava: 7 galleys, 5 naos, 2 transports\n- Alcántara: 6 galleys\n- Total Orders: 33 vessels\n\nThey've been fighting piracy as their first naval mission and have fortresses along the Granada coast.\n\nThe distance from Málaga/Almería to Tetouan is quite short - Tetouan is only about 40 miles south of Ceuta, directly across the Strait of Gibraltar area. The Military Orders could potentially respond quickly to a threat.\n\nLet me have the Masters respond to this question realistically.\n\n\nThe three Masters exchange glances. Don Luis de Guzmán, Master of Santiago, speaks first.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty asks a fair question.\" He rises and approaches the map, tracing the coastline. \"Since the conquest of Granada, we have spent six years building exactly the capability you describe.\"\n\n\nHe points to the Granadan coast.\n\n\n\"Santiago holds Almuñécar. Thirteen war galleys now, crewed and ready. We patrol from Málaga to Almería, and we have learned these waters well.\" His finger moves across the strait. \"Tetouan lies here—perhaps sixty miles from Málaga. In good weather, our galleys could make the crossing in a day. Perhaps less, with favorable winds.\"\n\n\nDon Pedro González de Padilla, Master of Calatrava, steps forward. \"Calatrava holds Almería. Seven galleys, five naos, two transports. Our focus has been the eastern approaches—watching for corsairs from Algiers and Tunis. But we could redirect within days if needed.\"\n\n\nDon Gutierre de Sotomayor, Master of Alcántara, completes the picture. \"Alcántara holds Marbella—the closest point to Tetouan. Six galleys. We have been the tip of the spear against Salé corsairs.\" He taps the map. \"From Marbella to Tetouan is perhaps forty miles. Half a day's sailing.\"\n\n\nDon Luis summarizes: \"Combined, the Orders can put twenty-six galleys, five naos, and two transports to sea within a week of receiving word. That is enough to land...\" He calculates. \"Perhaps two thousand men rapidly, more if we pack them tight. And we can resupply a garrison indefinitely, so long as we control the sea approaches.\"\n\n\nHe turns to face you directly.\n\n\n\"If Your Majesty takes Tetouan with the royal fleet and ten thousand men, and the Rif tribes besiege the city afterward—yes, we can reinforce. We can keep the sea lanes open. We can land fresh troops, evacuate wounded, bring food and ammunition.\" A pause. \"What we cannot do is march an army overland through the Rif Mountains. The sea is our road. As long as we hold it, Tetouan holds.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique nods slowly. \"So the strategy is clear. Take the city fast, before the Rif can mass. Install the Rashids. Fortify. And maintain naval supremacy to ensure reinforcement.\"\n\n\nDon Fadrique, the Admiral, has been calculating silently. \"Twelve thousand men leaves us approximately eight thousand capacity for other operations—Constantinople convoys, Atlantic patrols, trade protection. Tight, but manageable.\" He looks up. \"When does Your Majesty intend to strike?\""

Appoint a commander to lead the Tetouan operation this year (1439) while Juan travels to Florence, Hungary, and Poland\n2. Wait until next year (1440) when Juan can personally lead the attack\n\nThis is a significant strategic decision. Let me think about the factors:\n\n**Arguments for striking this year (1439) with appointed commander:**\n- The Rashids have been preparing for a year; they're ready\n- Morocco is still in political chaos (the stagnation report from Martín)\n- The longer they wait, the more chance something changes\n- The Ottoman truce expires in 1445 - Juan needs the African coast secured before the main confrontation\n- Demonstrates Juan can delegate effectively - important for an emperor of five realms\n- The operation is relatively straightforward militarily - take city, install vassals, fortify\n\n**Arguments for waiting until 1440 with Juan personally leading:**\n- Royal presence provides legitimacy and authority\n- Juan's personal command has been successful (Granada)\n- First major African operation - sets precedent\n- If something goes wrong, Juan can adapt on the spot\n- The Rashids would see their new lord personally installing them\n- Symbolic weight of the king crossing to Africa\n\n**What would the council say?**\n\nDon Álvaro would likely counsel caution about Juan being away during a major military operation - but he also knows Juan can't be everywhere\n\nThe Military Masters would probably prefer Juan lead - they're warriors who value royal presence in battle\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique might have practical military advice\n\nDon Fadrique as Admiral would think about naval logistics\n\nLet me have them debate this authentically, with different perspectives, without reaching a conclusion - let Juan decide.\n\n\nThe council stirs. This is not a question anyone expected.\n\n\nDon Álvaro speaks first, his voice careful. \"Your Majesty proposes to conduct a major military campaign and a diplomatic mission to Poland-Hungary simultaneously?\" He does not quite manage to keep the concern from his voice. \"That is... ambitious.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique folds his arms across his chest. \"I have served three kings in war, Your Majesty. And I will say plainly: the king's presence matters. When you stood before Granada, men fought harder because you were there. When you sailed to Constantinople, the Greeks took heart because the Defensor Romaniae had come in person.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"Tetouan would be the first Christian conquest in Africa since Ceuta. That is a moment for a king, not a deputy.\"\n\n\nBut Don Luis de Guzmán raises a hand. \"And yet—Your Majesty rules five realms now. You cannot be everywhere. If the crown can only act where the king stands personally, then the crown can only act in one place at a time.\" He glances at his fellow Masters. \"We have spent six years building the capability to project force across the strait. If we cannot use that capability without royal presence, what was the point?\"\n\n\nDon Fadrique, the Admiral, weighs in. \"The naval operation is straightforward. Land the troops, support the siege, maintain supply lines. Any competent admiral could manage it.\" A pause. \"The question is the land command. Who leads ten thousand men against a fortified city, installs a Muslim vassal, and then holds against a potential Rif counterattack—all while Your Majesty is a thousand miles away in Poland?\"\n\n\nThe Master of Alcántara, Don Gutierre de Sotomayor, leans forward. \"I held Constantinople for two years while Your Majesty was in Castile. It can be done. But Constantinople had Greeks who wanted us there. Tetouan...\" He looks at the map. \"The Rashids want us there. Will the population? Will the Rif? If something goes wrong—if a decision must be made in hours, not weeks—can a deputy make it?\"\n\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont, who has been silent, speaks up. \"There is also the matter of the academy's limitations, Your Majesty.\" His voice is quiet but firm. \"Our officers are trained for Christian warfare. Tetouan would be their first real campaign—and it would be against an enemy and terrain they have never faced. If Your Majesty leads personally, your experience compensates for their inexperience. If a deputy leads...\"\n\n\nHe leaves the implication hanging.\n\n\nDon Álvaro synthesizes the arguments. \"The question, Your Majesty, is this: Is Tetouan a military operation or a political one?\"\n\n\nHe steps to the map.\n\n\n\"If it is primarily military—take the city, hold the walls, defeat the Rif—then a competent commander can execute it. We have such men. Don Rodrigo here, or one of the Masters, or a combination.\"\n\n\nHis finger traces the strait.\n\n\n\"But if it is primarily political—install a Muslim vassal, establish a new model of African lordship, set a precedent for how Castile will expand beyond Iberia—then perhaps the king must be present. The Rashids are pledging themselves to you, not to Castile in the abstract. The message to Morocco, to the watching powers, is different when a king leads than when a deputy leads.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to you.\n\n\n\"There is also the matter of timing. If we strike this year, we strike in late summer or autumn—after Your Majesty has departed for Florence. If something goes wrong, you will not know for weeks. If we wait until next year, we strike in spring or summer of 1440, with Your Majesty in command.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique adds gruffly: \"A year is not so long, Your Majesty. The Rashids have waited three generations. They can wait twelve more months.\"\n\n\nBut the Master of Santiago counters: \"And in twelve months, Morocco's chaos may resolve. A strong sultan may emerge. The window may close.\"\n\n\nThe council falls silent, watching you."

Do they have contacts inside the city who might open a gate?\" A pause. \"I mean no disrespect to our future vassals, but I must know what forces I can count on beyond the twelve thousand Castilians.\"\n\n\nHe turns from the map.\n\n\n\"Fourth: command relationships. The Military Orders will provide naval support and potentially reinforcement. Do I have authority to call upon their forces if needed?

How much destruction is acceptable? If the walls do not breach quickly, do I have authority to bring down buildings? To fire the harbor?\" He meets your eyes steadily. \"I ask because these decisions shape how the Rashids will be received. If we leave them a ruin, they rule rubble.

Let me compile what I found from the project files:\n\nFrom Chapter_2_40_Summary.md (Spring 1436):\n- Current inventory: 40 serviceable cannon\n- Production rate: 8-10 cannon/year (up from 3/year during Granada)\n- Crisis identified: Navy needs 30 guns/year, foundry produces only 10\n- Ships carry half complement with wooden decoys painted as cannon\n- Foundry Expansion Approved:\n  - One-time investment: 6,000 florins (second furnace, recruitment)\n  - Annual costs from 1437: 17,000 florins total artillery budget\n  - Timeline: 3 years to full fleet armament (by spring 1439)\n  - Chaos Roll: 23 — Some challenges expected in expansion\n\nFrom Economic_Development_Plan_1438.docx:\n- Cannon Foundry status: EXPANDING WITH CHALLENGES (Expansion Roll: 23 - difficulties)\n- Production 1436: 8-10 guns/year\n- Production 1438: 18-22 guns/year\n- Skilled Workers: 12 (1436) → 24 (1438)\n- Furnaces: 1 (1436) → 2 (1438), but one temperamental\n- Problems Identified: Second furnace has inconsistent heat causing casting cracks. Bronze supply occasionally disrupted. Two apprentices poached by Aragonese foundries.\n- Additional Investment (APPROVED): 6,000 florins one-time (master founder recruitment 2,500 + domestic bronze supply 3,000 + apprentice retention 500). Target: 30 guns/year by late 1439.\n\nSo let me calculate:\n- 1436: Started with 40 cannons, produced 8-10 (let's say 9)\n\n\n- 1437: Produced maybe 12-15 (ramping up, but challenges)\n- 1438: Produced 18-22 (let's say 20)\n- 1439: Producing hopefully 25-30 (if fixes work)\n\nI'm tracking significant complications with cannon allocation. The massive royal fleet of 100 vessels creates immense pressure on our limited artillery production. Each ship requires multiple cannons, which means our land-based operations like Tetouan will face serious equipment constraints. The foundry's struggles compound this challenge, with inconsistent production and technical difficulties limiting our strategic flexibility.\n\nNaval requirements alone demand 200-300 cannons, yet our current inventory reveals a critical shortfall - many ships carry wooden decoys instead of actual artillery. This suggests we're far from complete fleet armament, despite optimistic spring 1439 targets. The siege operations at Tetouan will require specialized heavy bombards, different from naval guns, further stretching our limited manufacturing capacity.\n\nI'll need to develop a nuanced allocation strategy that balances naval expansion, siege requirements, and production limitations.\n\n\nLet me compile what the project files tell us about cannon production and inventory.\n\n\n\nArtillery Situation Summary:\n\n\nSpring 1436 (Chapter 2.40):\n\n\nInventory: 40 serviceable cannon\n\nProduction: 8-10 guns/year\n\nCrisis: Navy needs 30 guns/year, foundry produces only 10\n\nShips carrying half complement with wooden decoys\n\nFoundry expansion approved (6,000 florins)\n\nExpansion Roll: 23 — Challenges expected\n\n\n1438 Status (Economic Development Plan):\n\n\nProduction increased to 18-22 guns/year\n\nSecond furnace operational but \"temperamental\" (inconsistent heat, casting cracks)\n\nBronze supply occasionally disrupted\n\nTwo apprentices poached by Aragonese foundries\n\nAdditional 6,000 florins approved to fix problems\n\nTarget: 30 guns/year by late 1439\n\n\nThe Complication:\nThe navy has been absorbing most production. Your fleet grew from minimal to 100+ vessels, many requiring guns. The original Granada campaign used only 5 medium bombards under Pietro Calabrese. Siege guns are different from naval guns—heavier, designed for breaching walls.\n\n\n\nCannon Inventory for Tetouan (Spring 1440)\n\n\nd100 Table: Available Siege Artillery\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nCrisis: 8-12 heavy guns. The foundry challenges proved worse than expected. The temperamental second furnace cracked during a major casting, destroying months of work. Naval demands consumed everything else. Pietro Calabrese has scraped together barely enough for a modest siege—fewer guns than Granada. Breach will take longer; the Rif will have more time to mass.\n11-25\nStrained: 15-18 heavy guns. Production never reached targets. The second furnace works, but inconsistently—one in four castings fails. Naval allocation took priority. You have enough for a competent siege battery, but no margin for losses. If guns burst or are captured, you cannot replace them quickly.\n26-40\nAdequate: 20-25 heavy guns. The foundry expansion succeeded partially. Production reached 22-25 guns/year, but naval needs consumed most output. Pietro has assembled a solid siege train—comparable to Granada—but this represents nearly everything available. The navy's guns cannot be stripped without crippling fleet operations.\n41-55\nSolid: 28-32 heavy guns. The additional investment paid off. The temperamental furnace was fixed; a skilled founder was recruited from Nuremberg. Production hit 28 guns/year by late 1439. You have a proper siege train with reserves. Pietro can rotate guns if barrels overheat, and losses can be absorbed.\n56-70\nStrong: 35-40 heavy guns. Production exceeded expectations. The Nuremberg master brought techniques that improved casting reliability significantly. Bronze supply issues were resolved through domestic sourcing. You have enough siege artillery to breach multiple points simultaneously if needed, plus reserves. The navy is also approaching full complement.\n71-85\nExcellent: 45-50 heavy guns. Everything came together. Both furnaces running reliably, skilled workforce expanded, bronze supply stable. Production hit 32 guns/year ahead of schedule. Pietro has assembled the largest Castilian siege train ever fielded—enough to reduce Tetouan's walls to rubble within days, with guns to spare for counter-battery work against any Moroccan artillery.\n86-95\nExceptional: 55-60 heavy guns. The foundry became a model of efficiency. A third furnace was added ahead of schedule. Apprentices trained faster than expected. You have siege capability that would make Italian condottieri envious—multiple batteries, specialized pieces for different ranges, and full naval complement besides. Tetouan's walls will not survive a week.\n96-100\nBreakthrough: 65+ heavy guns, including new designs. Something unexpected happened—perhaps Pietro collaborated with the Nuremberg masters to develop improved casting techniques, or a rich copper deposit was found that solved bronze supply permanently. You have not merely enough guns, but better guns—longer range, more reliable, faster to load. The siege train includes experimental pieces that have never been tested in combat. Tetouan may be their proving ground.\n\n\nRoll when ready for cannon inventory, then we'll address the landing site intelligence question."

That's \"Excellent: 45-50 heavy guns.\" This is a very good result - the foundry expansion worked well, and they have a substantial siege train.\n\nNow I need to draft a d100 table for intelligence about the Tetouan landing sites/coast. This depends on Commander Martín's network that has been operating in Morocco since 1433 - that's 6+ years of intelligence gathering. The network had moderate success initially (Roll 71), then stagnation (Roll 20), but the foundation remained. They have people in Tetouan specifically.\n\nFactors to consider:\n- Martín's network has been in place for 6 years\n- They established presence in Tetouan specifically\n- The Banu Rashid may have knowledge from their ancestral claims\n- Fernando (the converted qadi) is part of the network and respected as a scholar in Tetouan\n- The network experienced stagnation but maintained its cover\n- Morocco's political chaos meant people were cautious but the network survived\n\nSuccess factors:\n- 6 years of network operation\n- Specific presence in Tetouan\n- Rashid family has ancestral knowledge of the area\n- Fernando's scholarly respect in Tetouan gives access\n- Commercial cover allows coastal observation\n- Interest in the operation means they would have been gathering this intelligence\n\nFailure factors:\n- Network was in \"stagnation\" mode - not advancing\n- Cautious operation means limited aggressive intelligence gathering\n- Coastal military information is more sensitive than commercial intelligence\n- Locals might be suspicious of too many questions about beaches and defenses\n- The Rashids haven't been to Tetouan in three generations - their knowledge is ancestral, possibly outdated\n\n\nArtillery Assessment: Excellent\n\n\nDon Rodrigo's eyes widen slightly as you share the artillery report from Pietro Calabrese.\n\n\n\"Forty-five to fifty siege guns, Your Majesty. Both furnaces running true, the Nuremberg techniques proving their worth.\" Don Álvaro sets down the document. \"This is the largest siege train Castile has ever assembled. More than we brought against Granada.\"\n\n\nPietro Calabrese—summoned earlier for exactly this question—permits himself a rare smile. \"The second furnace gave us trouble for two years, Your Majesty. Cracks in the castings, inconsistent heat. But the master we recruited from Nuremberg understood the problem. The firebrick lining was wrong—German furnaces use a different clay mixture. Once we corrected it...\" He spreads his hands. \"Production jumped to thirty-two guns last year. We have built reserves for the first time.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo nods with satisfaction. \"With fifty guns, I can establish multiple batteries. Main breach, secondary breach, counter-battery positions to suppress any Moroccan artillery. We rotate barrels to prevent overheating. If we lose guns to accident or enemy action, we have replacements.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to the map.\n\n\n\"Tetouan's walls will not stand long against such a train. The question remains—can we get the guns ashore and into battery before the Rif arrive?\"\n\n\n\nIntelligence on Landing Sites\n\n\nDon Álvaro consults his notes. \"Commander Martín's network has operated in Tetouan for six years now. Fernando—the converted qadi—is respected there as a scholar. And the Rashids themselves have ancestral knowledge of the region, though three generations old.\"\n\n\n\"The question,\" Don Rodrigo says, \"is whether that network gathered military intelligence. Beaches, depths, approaches, defensive positions. Or only commercial and political information.\"\n\n\n\nd100 Table: Coastal Intelligence Quality\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nSix years of network operation in Tetouan specifically\n\nFernando's scholarly respect grants access to educated locals\n\nCommercial cover allows observation of harbor and coastal trade\n\nRashid family has ancestral knowledge (though potentially outdated)\n\nJuan's specific questions to Martín (Chapter 2.32) would have prompted focused collection\n\nMerchants and fishermen know coastal waters intimately\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nNetwork was in \"stagnation\" mode—cautious, not aggressive\n\nMilitary intelligence is more sensitive than commercial information\n\nToo many questions about beaches and defenses might raise suspicion\n\nRashid knowledge is three generations old—coastline may have changed\n\nMorocco's political chaos made everyone suspicious of outsiders\n\nNo Castilian naval vessels have scouted the area (would break cover)\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nBlind. The network focused entirely on political and commercial intelligence. No one thought to map beaches or measure water depths—that would have been suspicious and dangerous. Fernando's scholarly cover kept him in libraries and mosques, not on fishing boats. The Rashids' ancestral knowledge proves nearly useless; the coastline has silted and shifted over three generations. You know where Tetouan is, but almost nothing about how to approach it from the sea. Landing will be a dangerous improvisation.\n11-25\nFragmentary. Martín's people gathered scraps—overheard conversations with fishermen, general descriptions of the harbor approaches, rough sketches based on memory. But nothing systematic. Water depths are guessed, beach composition unknown, defensive positions marked only as \"walls here\" without detail. The Rashids remember their grandfather's stories, but cannot distinguish memory from legend. You have something, but Don Rodrigo will be planning with dangerous gaps.\n26-40\nBasic. The network collected general coastal information as part of normal commercial intelligence. The harbor is mapped adequately—where ships anchor, where cargo is loaded, approximate depths for merchant vessels. But military details remain sparse. Beach composition north of the city is described as \"sandy\" by one source and \"rocky\" by another. Defensive positions are known to exist but not precisely located. The Rashids contribute useful context about terrain and roads, but their naval knowledge is limited. Enough to plan, but scouts will need to fill gaps before landing.\n41-55\nAdequate. Martín understood that military intelligence might eventually be needed. His merchants befriended local fishermen, learning the waters as \"curious foreigners.\" Fernando cultivated a retired ship captain who drew rough charts of the approaches. The Rashids' ancestral knowledge, cross-referenced with current observations, proves more accurate than expected. You have workable information on harbor depth, beach approaches north and south of the city, and the location of coastal watchtowers. Not perfect, but enough for competent planning.\n56-70\nGood. The network conducted careful, systematic intelligence gathering. A Granadan fisherman recruited to the network spent two seasons working Tetouan's waters, memorizing depths and currents. Fernando commissioned a \"scholarly map\" of the region from a local cartographer, ostensibly for a geographic treatise. The Rashids identified which of their ancestral knowledge still holds true. You have reliable charts of the approaches, accurate beach assessments, watchtower positions, and even tidal patterns. Don Rodrigo can plan with confidence.\n71-85\nExcellent. Martín's network exceeded expectations. Anticipating exactly this operation, they spent the last two years systematically mapping every military-relevant detail. Multiple sources cross-checked each other—fishermen, merchants, a bribed harbor official, even a Riffian tribesman who sold information for silver. Beach composition confirmed by direct observation (a \"shipwrecked\" merchant who waded ashore). Defensive positions sketched by Fernando during a \"pilgrimage\" along the coast. Water depths measured by weighted lines dropped from fishing boats. You have intelligence that rivals what Venice gathers on its own territories.\n86-95\nExceptional. The network produced a comprehensive operational assessment. Martín personally supervised the final collection, understanding that his years of patient work would culminate in this moment. You have precise charts with depth soundings, beach gradients measured in paces, defensive positions with garrison estimates, patrol schedules for coastal watchtowers, even the names of the officers commanding the city's defense. The Rashids contributed insider knowledge about which defenders might be bribed or persuaded. Don Rodrigo will plan this landing as if he had walked the beaches himself.\n96-100\nExtraordinary: Inside Access. Something remarkable happened. Perhaps a defender defected to the Rashid cause and provided everything. Perhaps Fernando converted a senior official who delivered military archives. Perhaps the Rashids' claim attracted secret supporters inside Tetouan who want the rightful lords restored. Whatever the cause, you have not merely intelligence but collaboration. Detailed plans of the walls and their weak points. Knowledge of which gates are poorly guarded and when. Even suggestions for where to land that local defenders will be slow to reach. The operation may be easier than anyone anticipated—if the information is genuine and not an elaborate trap.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

This means Martín's network conducted careful, systematic intelligence gathering. They have reliable charts of the approaches, accurate beach assessments, watchtower positions, and even tidal patterns. Don Rodrigo can plan with confidence.\n\nNow the player wants to roll to see if this intelligence reveals any good landing spots. This makes sense - having good intelligence is one thing, but whether the terrain actually offers favorable landing sites is another question entirely. The intelligence quality affects how well we understand the options, but the geography itself is a separate factor.\n\nLet me draft a d100 table for landing site quality based on what the intelligence reveals.\n\n\nCoastal Intelligence: Good\n\n\nDon Álvaro produces a leather satchel and spreads its contents across the table—charts, sketches, notes in multiple hands, some in Arabic with Castilian annotations.\n\n\n\"Commander Martín understood what we would eventually need,\" he says. \"For the past two years, his network has been gathering this systematically.\"\n\n\nThe council leans in as Don Fadrique, the Admiral, examines the charts with a professional eye.\n\n\n\"These are workable,\" he murmurs, tracing the coastline with his finger. \"Depth soundings here... tidal notations... this was done by someone who knows the sea.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"A Granadan fisherman—one of our converts—spent two seasons working these waters. Memorized everything, wrote nothing down until he was safely back in Málaga.\" He points to another document. \"Fernando commissioned this map from a local cartographer. Claimed it was for a scholarly treatise on Mediterranean geography. The man was happy to include details a scholar would never need.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo studies the sketches of defensive positions. \"Watchtowers marked here, here, and here. Patrol routes indicated. This tells me where their eyes are—and where their blind spots might be.\"\n\n\nThe Rashids' contribution is evident too—annotations comparing \"grandfather's account\" with \"current observation,\" marking what has changed and what remains true.\n\n\n\"We can plan with this,\" Don Rodrigo concludes. \"Not perfect, but good. I know where the walls are strong, where the harbor defenses concentrate, where the watchtowers can see.\"\n\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\n\"The question now is: what does the land itself offer us? Good intelligence tells us what we're looking at. But does the coastline give us anywhere favorable to land twelve thousand men and fifty siege guns?\"\n\n\n\nd100 Table: Landing Site Quality\n\n\nThe intelligence is good—but geography is fixed. The question is whether Tetouan's coastline offers favorable options for an amphibious assault, or whether the terrain itself is the enemy.\n\n\nFactors Favoring Good Sites:\n\n\nMediterranean coastline often has mixed terrain with options\n\nTetouan sits on a river (Martil)—river mouths often have beaches\n\nCommercial harbor suggests some accessible shoreline\n\nThree generations ago, the Rashids landed armies here during their own wars\n\nNorth African coast historically used for amphibious operations\n\n\nFactors Against Good Sites:\n\n\nRif Mountains come close to the coast—may limit beach depth\n\nRocky coastline common in this region\n\nAny obvious landing sites would be known to defenders\n\nBest beaches may be directly under watchtower observation\n\nShallow waters might prevent large ships from approaching\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nHostile Terrain. The intelligence confirms the worst: Tetouan's coastline is a defender's dream. Rocky shores north and south, with the only accessible beach directly beneath the main watchtower and within cannon range of the walls. The river mouth is silted and treacherous—ships that draw more than six feet will ground offshore. Any landing means wading through surf under observation, dragging guns through sand while defenders mass. The Rashids' grandfather landed here, yes—but he held the city and controlled the shore. An opposed landing will be a bloodbath.\n11-25\nDifficult. Options exist, but none are good. The nearest suitable beach lies four miles north—beyond watchtower range, but requiring a long march through rough terrain to reach the city. The ground is rocky; gun carriages will struggle. Alternatively, the river mouth offers direct access but is shallow and defended. Either choice imposes serious costs: exhausted troops arriving at the walls, or heavy casualties in the initial landing. Don Rodrigo will need to choose between bad and worse.\n26-40\nMarginal. The intelligence reveals one viable landing site: a beach two miles north of the city where a seasonal stream has deposited sand over generations. It's outside direct observation from the main watchtower, though a smaller post has partial visibility. The approach requires careful navigation—submerged rocks to the east—but experienced pilots can manage it. The beach is narrow; landing will take time. Guns can be brought ashore, but the ground rises steeply behind the beach, complicating the advance. Workable, but barely.\n41-55\nAdequate. Two landing options emerge from the intelligence. The northern beach offers safety from observation but difficult terrain beyond. The southern approach, near a fishing village, provides better ground but lies within range of a watchtower that must be suppressed or destroyed quickly. Neither is perfect, but both are feasible. Don Rodrigo has choices—he can weight speed against safety, surprise against terrain. A competent commander can make either work.\n56-70\nFavorable. The intelligence reveals a site the defenders have underestimated: a crescent beach three miles north where the Martil River's ancient course once met the sea. The old riverbed provides a natural road inland—relatively flat, firm ground suitable for gun carriages. The watchtower with visibility here is the smallest and most distant; a night landing could be complete before alarm spreads. The beach can accommodate multiple ships simultaneously. This is genuinely good ground for an amphibious operation.\n71-85\nExcellent. The coastline offers multiple strong options, allowing tactical flexibility. The primary site—a broad beach sheltered by a headland—permits landing in two waves while remaining hidden from the main watchtowers. The secondary site provides a flanking approach if the primary is contested. The river mouth, while defended, is less formidable than expected; a bold commander might force it directly. Don Rodrigo can develop multiple plans and choose based on conditions. The terrain favors the attacker more than anyone expected.\n86-95\nIdeal. The intelligence reveals something remarkable: a natural harbor formation north of the city, concealed by a rocky outcropping, that local fishermen call the \"Hidden Bay.\" Large enough for the fleet to anchor in calm water, with a beach that slopes gently to firm ground beyond. The defenders know it exists but consider it too far from the city to matter—they've posted no permanent watch. An army could land here completely unobserved, form up at leisure, and march on Tetouan with guns in battery before the garrison knows they've arrived.\n96-100\nStrategic Gift. The combination of intelligence and geography reveals an opportunity no one anticipated. Not only does an excellent landing site exist, but the terrain beyond creates a natural trap. The \"Ravine of the Martyrs\"—where a Rashid ancestor won a famous victory two centuries ago—channels any relieving force from the Rif into a killing ground. Land at the hidden beach, invest the city, and when the tribal armies come to relieve it, they must pass through terrain perfectly suited for ambush. The same geography that produced a Rashid victory might produce a Castilian one. The ancestors may be smiling on their descendants' return.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

The coastline around Tetouan is terrible for amphibious operations. The player is already thinking tactically - suggesting landing at Ceuta (which Portugal holds) and marching along the coast.\n\nThis is a significant complication. Let me think about the implications:\n\n1. Ceuta is Portuguese - they would need Portuguese permission\n2. A march from Ceuta to Tetouan is about 40 miles through potentially hostile Rif territory\n3. This changes the entire nature of the operation from a quick amphibious assault to a prolonged land campaign\n\nDon Rodrigo and the others should react to this news and discuss the alternatives. This is exactly the kind of complication that makes the simulation interesting.\n\n\nHostile Terrain\n\n\nThe room falls silent as Don Fadrique finishes his assessment of the charts.\n\n\n\"The coastline is... not favorable, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nHe spreads the detailed soundings across the table, his expression grim.\n\n\n\"The Rif Mountains do not merely overlook Tetouan—they embrace it. Rocky shores north and south, with cliffs in places.

But dragging fifty siege guns through surf and sand while arrows and stones rain down...\"\n\n\n\"The Rashids' grandfather landed armies here,\" the Master of Santiago observes.\n\n\n\"The Rashids' grandfather held the city,\" Don Rodrigo replies flatly. \"He controlled the shore. An opposed landing on this terrain...\" He exhales. \"It can be done. But the cost would be severe. Perhaps a thousand men dead before we even reach the walls. And the guns—some would be lost in the surf. Saltwater ruins powder. Carriages break on rocks.\"\n\n\nHe looks up at your suggestion, his tactical mind already working.\n\n\n\nAlternative Approaches\n\n\nDon Fadrique nods slowly. \"Ceuta is forty miles northeast. Portuguese territory—we would need King Duarte's permission. But the harbor is excellent, and the road to Tetouan...\" He glances at the charts. \"Passable. Coastal terrain, some rough stretches, but nothing that would stop an army.\"\n\n\n\"Forty miles through hostile territory,\" the Master of Calatrava observes. \"The Rif will know we've landed before we've marched five miles. They'll have days to mass, not hours.\"\n\n\n\"But we'd have our guns,\" Don Rodrigo counters. \"Intact, dry, ready to fire. And twelve thousand men in formation, not scattered across a bloody beach.\"\n\n\nDon Álvaro raises a practical concern. \"The Portuguese question is not simple, Your Majesty. Ceuta is Duarte's proudest possession—the foothold in Africa his father won. Allowing a Castilian army to stage from Portuguese territory, to conquer a city Portugal might have claimed...\" He spreads his hands. \"It requires negotiation. Duarte is our ally, yes. But this is a significant request.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago offers another thought. \"There may be other options. Tangier lies between Ceuta and Tetouan—closer, perhaps thirty miles. Our network operates there too. Perhaps the coastline is more favorable?\"\n\n\n\"Or we land further south,\" Don Fadrique adds, \"beyond Tetouan, and approach from an unexpected direction. The defenders would expect us from the north, from Christian territory. An army appearing from the south...\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo holds up a hand. \"All of these require more intelligence. We know Tetouan's coast is hostile. We do not yet know what alternatives exist.\"\n\n\nHe turns to you.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I see four options:\n\n\nFirst: Land at Tetouan anyway, accepting heavy casualties on the beach. Speed is preserved—we reach the walls within hours—but at great cost in men and possibly guns.\n\n\nSecond: Request staging rights from Portugal at Ceuta. March forty miles along the coast. We arrive intact but give the Rif days to prepare. This requires diplomatic negotiation with King Duarte.\n\n\nThird: Investigate Tangier as an alternative staging point. Our network may be able to assess the coastline there. This delays planning but might reveal a better option.\n\n\nFourth: Send scouts—quietly, by fishing boat—to survey the coast south of Tetouan. Perhaps there is a landing site the defenders do not expect. This also delays planning and risks alerting the enemy.\"\n\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\n\"We have a year, Your Majesty.

How many siege guns? - ANSWERED (45-50)\n2. Landing site intelligence? - ANSWERED (good intelligence, but hostile terrain - will use Ceuta or find alternative)\n3. The Rashids - how many men, what quality, land with us or infiltrate beforehand, contacts inside the city?\n4.

You said they have been gathering men from Granada—Muslims who wish to return to Africa under their rule. How many? What quality? Do they land with us, or infiltrate beforehand?\"\n\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\n\"And critically—do they have contacts inside Tetouan? Men who remember the old lords, who might open a gate or provide intelligence on the garrison's movements? Three generations is a long time, but family loyalties run deep in these lands. If someone inside the walls still honors the Rashid name...\"\n\n\nHe leaves the implication hanging.

Or do I maintain military authority until Your Majesty arrives to formally install them?\"\n\n\nHis tone is careful, not challenging.\n\n\n\"I am a soldier, Your Majesty. I know how to take a city and hold it against counterattack. I do not know how to govern Muslims, or navigate the politics between the Rashids and whatever factions exist inside Tetouan. If the city falls and a dispute arises—over property, over prisoners, over which mosque becomes a church and which remains—I need to know whether I decide, or Ahmad al-Rashid decides, or we wait for you.\"\n\n\n\nRules of Engagement\n\n\n\"Third: destruction.\" His voice grows quieter. \"Tetouan is a city. There will be civilians—women, children, merchants, craftsmen. There will be mosques. Markets. Homes.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes steadily.\n\n\n\"If the walls do not breach quickly, do I have authority to bring down buildings with cannon fire? To burn the harbor if enemy ships threaten our supply line? To level a quarter of the city if that is what it takes to break resistance?\"\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\"I ask because these decisions shape everything that follows. If we leave the Rashids a ruin, they rule rubble and resentful survivors. Their authority begins in ashes. But if I hold back too much, my men die taking streets house by house, and the Rif have time to arrive while we bleed in the alleys.\"\n\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\n\"I have seen cities taken both ways, Your Majesty. I have seen them sacked until nothing remained but corpses and crying children. I have seen them taken gently and lost again within a year because the defenders were never truly broken. I need to know which kind of victory you want—and how much you are willing to pay for it.\"\n\n\n\nThe council waits in silence. These are not questions with easy answers."

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed competing factors influencing Rashid family recruitment prospects.\n\nThe user wants me to create a d100 table to determine what support the Rashid family has been able to gather - both in terms of men from Granada who want to return to Africa under their rule, and potentially contacts inside Tetouan who might support their return.\n\nLet me think about the factors involved:\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- The Rashids are a legitimate old ruling family with a real claim\n- They've had nearly a year to prepare since the meeting with Juan (Chapter 2.50)\n- Granada has a large Muslim population (~300,000) who might prefer life under Muslim lords in Africa\n- The Rashids have four capable sons handling different aspects (Khalid-finances, Tariq-military, Yusuf-legal/religious, Omar-eager youth)\n- Juan gave them legitimacy by formally granting them the title of Sahib al-Thaghr\n- Three generations of exile means they've likely maintained some networks and family connections\n- Morocco's political chaos means Tetouan's current rulers may be unpopular or weak\n- The promise of returning to ancestral lands is a powerful motivator\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- Three generations is a long time - most people who knew the Rashids are dead\n- Muslims in Granada may prefer to stay in a stable Castile rather than risk Africa\n- The Rashids are now vassals of a Christian king - this may taint them in Muslim eyes\n- Morocco's chaos means everyone is cautious - backing the wrong horse is dangerous\n- Current rulers of Tetouan will have their own loyalists\n- Recruiting openly for a military expedition against a Muslim city... complicated\n- Many Granadan Muslims may not trust the Rashids or this arrangement\n- The Rashids have been in exile so long they may have lost touch with reality about their support\n\nLet me draft a balanced table.\n\n\nRashid Support Assessment\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nNearly a year of preparation since the formal agreement (Chapter 2.50)\n\nLegitimate ancestral claim—the Rashids were rulers, not merely nobles\n\nFour capable sons dividing responsibilities (Khalid-finances, Tariq-military, Yusuf-legal/religious, Omar-enthusiasm)\n\nFormal title grant (Sahib al-Thaghr) provides legitimacy and royal backing\n\nGranada's Muslim population (~300,000) includes many who might prefer life under Muslim lords\n\nSome Granadan Muslims face pressure, discrimination, or simply homesickness for dar al-Islam\n\nThe promise of land and position in a \"restored\" Tetouan is attractive to ambitious men\n\nMorocco's political chaos means Tetouan's current rulers may be weak or unpopular\n\nFamily networks and old loyalties may persist even after three generations\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nThree generations of exile—most who knew the Rashids personally are dead\n\nThe Rashids are now vassals of a Christian king—this taints them in many Muslim eyes\n\nGranada's Muslims may prefer stable Castilian rule to uncertain African adventure\n\nRecruiting for war against a Muslim city is religiously complicated—some will see it as fitna (civil strife)\n\nMorocco's chaos makes everyone cautious—backing the wrong faction is dangerous\n\nCurrent rulers of Tetouan have their own loyalists and three generations of established power\n\nMany potential recruits may distrust the arrangement—\"Are we soldiers or hostages?\"\n\nThe Rashids may have romanticized their support; exile breeds delusions\n\nSkilled fighters are valuable in Granada too—why leave for uncertainty?\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nBitter Disappointment. The Rashids' dreams have collided with reality. Despite months of effort, they have gathered barely 200 men—mostly desperate outcasts, debtors fleeing creditors, young hotheads with nothing to lose. No serious warriors, no experienced officers, no one of standing. Worse, word of their Christian vassalage has spread; respectable Granadan Muslims shun them as traitors to the faith. Inside Tetouan, their name is remembered only as a cautionary tale of fallen pride. Ahmad al-Rashid ages visibly as report after report brings disappointment. The Rashids can provide guides and translators, but not a fighting force.\n11-25\nMeager Response. The Rashids have assembled perhaps 400-500 men—enough to notice, not enough to matter. A few veterans, some young men seeking adventure, scattered families hoping for land in a new home. But the quality is uneven; Tariq admits privately that half would flee at the first serious fighting. No contacts of value inside Tetouan have emerged—the old loyalties have faded beyond recovery. The Rashids can garrison the city after it falls, perhaps, but they cannot help take it. Their contribution is political legitimacy, not military strength.\n26-40\nModest Force. Roughly 800-1,000 men have answered the Rashid call. A core of perhaps 200 genuine fighters—former Granadan soldiers who never reconciled to Christian rule—surrounded by settlers, craftsmen, and families seeking a new start. Yusuf has recruited a few minor scholars and imams willing to bless the enterprise. Inside Tetouan, the Rashids have identified one or two families who remember the old days and might provide information, but nothing actionable—no one willing to risk their necks opening gates. A useful auxiliary force, but Don Rodrigo cannot rely on them for serious combat.\n41-55\nCredible Following. The Rashids have gathered 1,200-1,500 followers, including 300-400 trained fighters. Tariq has organized them into something resembling military units; they drill regularly and have a chain of command. Several minor notables from Granada—men of some standing who found Christian rule intolerable—have attached themselves to the Rashid cause, lending respectability. Inside Tetouan, cautious contact has been established with a merchant family who trades information for silver and hints at others who might support a restoration \"if it seems likely to succeed.\" A real contribution, though still secondary to Castilian arms.\n56-70\nStrong Support. Nearly 2,000 men have rallied to the Rashid banner—a genuine following. The core includes 500-600 experienced fighters, some of whom served in Granada's armies before the conquest. Three minor emirs from Granada's old nobility have pledged themselves, bringing retainers and legitimacy. Yusuf has secured the quiet blessing of two respected Granadan scholars who frame the enterprise as restoration, not collaboration. Inside Tetouan, a network is forming: a harbor official's cousin, a gate captain's brother-in-law, merchants who remember Rashid justice fondly. Nothing certain, but possibilities. The Rashids can hold a quarter of the city themselves once breached.\n71-85\nImpressive Assembly. The Rashids have gathered 2,500-3,000 followers, a force that would be significant even without Castilian backing. The military core—700-800 trained men—includes veterans, former officers, even a few who served the Nasrid sultans themselves. Five notable families have openly committed, burning their bridges in Granada. Yusuf has assembled a small court-in-waiting: scholars, administrators, a qadi willing to serve Rashid justice. Inside Tetouan, the network has grown teeth—a junior officer in the garrison, a guild master with keys to a postern gate, and whispers that some of the Rif chiefs might prefer Rashid rule to the current chaos. Don Rodrigo may find the city softer than expected.\n86-95\nMovement, Not Mere Following. Something remarkable has happened: the Rashid restoration has become a cause. Over 4,000 have gathered—men, families, craftsmen, scholars, warriors—a small city preparing to reclaim another. The military force numbers over 1,000 trained fighters, organized into units, commanded by officers who served Granada. The religious establishment has fractured; while most condemn the enterprise, a significant minority argues that restoring Muslim rule—even under Christian suzerainty—is preferable to Christian rule directly. Inside Tetouan, the ground has been prepared: a gate captain has been bribed, a section of wall identified as weakly guarded, and three Rif chiefs have secretly indicated they will not oppose a Rashid restoration if it succeeds quickly. The city may fall faster than anyone imagined.\n96-100\nThe Heir Returns. The Rashid cause has ignited something no one anticipated. Word has spread across the Maghreb: the rightful lords are returning, backed by the Christian king who conquered Granada yet let Muslims live in peace. Nearly 6,000 have gathered—not just from Granada, but from Morocco itself. Refugees from Tetouan's current misrule, men who remember their grandfathers' stories, adventurers who sense the wind shifting. The military force exceeds 1,500 trained fighters. Inside Tetouan, the current governor faces a crisis: his own officers whisper about the Rashids, the garrison's loyalty wavers, and the populace—ground down by years of bad governance—looks to the horizon with hope rather than fear. When the Castilian fleet appears, the gates may open before a single gun is fired. Ahmad al-Rashid weeps when he hears the reports: \"God has not forgotten us.\"\n\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty."

      "say": "Thought process: Synthesized military strategy and governance coordination for campaign conclusion.\n\nThe user is wrapping up the war council for the Tetouan operation. Let me summarize what's been decided and have Don Rodrigo confirm he has what he needs or ask any final questions.\n\nKey decisions made:\n1. Attack in Spring 1440 with 12,000 troops\n2. Don Rodrigo Manrique commands, second to Juan when present\n3. 45-50 siege guns available (Roll 82 - Excellent)\n4. Good coastal intelligence (Roll 58) but hostile landing terrain (Roll 3)\n5. Will request Portuguese permission to stage from Ceuta, scout coast for alternatives\n6. Rashid forces: Impressive Assembly - 2,500-3,000 followers, 700-800 trained fighters, network inside Tetouan (Roll 73)\n7. Command structure: Rodrigo maintains military command, coordinates with Rashids on governance/pacification\n8. Rules of engagement: Consult with Rashids on destruction levels\n9. Prepare fortification workforce and materials in advance\n\nDon Rodrigo should confirm he has everything or raise any final minor points, then wrap up the council.\n\n\nRashid Support: Impressive Assembly\n\n\nDon Álvaro consults the latest reports from the Rashid household.\n\n\n\"They have exceeded expectations, Your Majesty. Twenty-five hundred to three thousand followers have gathered under the Rashid banner.\"\n\n\nHe reads from the summary:\n\n\n\"The military core numbers seven to eight hundred trained fighters—veterans of Granada's armies, former officers, men who know siege work and street fighting. Five notable families have openly committed to the cause, bringing their retainers and their reputations. Yusuf al-Rashid has assembled a court-in-waiting: scholars to staff the madrasas, administrators who served the old emirate, even a qadi willing to dispense Rashid justice.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo's eyebrows rise. \"And inside the city?\"\n\n\n\"A network,\" Álvaro confirms. \"A junior officer in the garrison—his grandmother was a Rashid servant. A guild master with keys to a postern gate. And whispers that some of the Rif chiefs might prefer Rashid restoration to the current chaos. The ground has been prepared.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago lets out a low whistle. \"Three thousand men. That's not a household guard—that's an army.\"\n\n\n\"An auxiliary army,\" Don Rodrigo corrects, but there's new respect in his voice. \"Eight hundred fighters who know the language, the customs, the streets. Who can tell friend from foe when my Castilians cannot.\" He nods slowly. \"This changes things. The city may be softer than I feared.\"\n\n\n\nFinal Instructions\n\n\nDon Rodrigo listens carefully as you outline the command arrangements and rules of engagement.\n\n\n\"Understood, Your Majesty. Military command remains mine; governance coordination with the Rashids. I will meet with Tariq al-Rashid—the military son—and Ahmad himself before we sail. We will establish clear protocols: what they need preserved, what can be destroyed if necessary, how we handle prisoners and property.\"\n\n\nHe makes notes as you speak of fortifications.\n\n\n\"The walls will need strengthening regardless of how the city falls. I will have engineers assess requirements and prepare workforce levies. Stone, timber, lime—we can stage materials at Ceuta or Málaga, ready to ship once the harbor is secure.\" A pause. \"The Rashids may have opinions on which walls matter most. Their ancestors built some of them.\"\n\n\nHe sets down his quill and looks around the table, then back to you.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I believe I have what I need.\"\n\n\nHe counts off on his scarred fingers:\n\n\n\"Forces: Twelve thousand men, spring 1440. Fifty siege guns under Pietro Calabrese.\n\n\nApproach: Stage from Ceuta with Portuguese permission; scout the coast for alternatives this year. March overland unless a superior landing site is discovered.\n\n\nAllies: The Rashids provide twenty-five hundred to three thousand followers, including eight hundred fighters. They have contacts inside the city and possibly among the Rif chiefs.\n\n\nCommand: I hold military authority throughout. I coordinate with the Rashids on governance and rules of engagement. They advise on what must be preserved; I decide what military necessity requires.\n\n\nReinforcement: The Military Orders stand ready to relieve or resupply by sea. I may call upon their galleys as if the order came from Your Majesty directly.\n\n\nFortification: Engineers and workforce prepared in advance. Materials staged for immediate shipment once the harbor is secure.\n\n\nTimeline: One year to drill loading and unloading of artillery, to scout the coast, to coordinate with the Rashids, to prepare everything.\"\n\n\nHe stands and bows.\n\n\n\"When Your Majesty returns from Poland, I will have Tetouan ready to fall—or already fallen, if God wills and the opportunity arises.\"\n\n\n\nThe other commanders voice their agreement. Don Fadrique confirms naval coordination. The Masters pledge their galleys. Sir Thomas Beaumont will assign his best academy officers to Don Rodrigo's staff.\n\n\nDon Álvaro is already drafting the letter to King Duarte requesting staging rights at Ceuta.\n\n\n\"Is there anything else Your Majesty wishes to address before the council concludes?\" Álvaro asks, quill poised. \"The hour grows late, and there is still the matter of your diplomatic journey to prepare.\""
