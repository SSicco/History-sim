Let me check what I know about this expedition.\n\nFrom the chapter summary, it mentions \"Mali/Timbuktu expedition results expected 1439\" as an unresolved thread. I need to search for more information about this expedition to understand what it was and what it might bring back.\n\nLet me search the project knowledge for information about this expedition.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Orchestrated expedition's triumphant return with substantial treasures.\n\nI found the key information. The Mali/Timbuktu expedition had an Exceptional Achievement roll of 91, and the predetermined results are:\n\n1. Expedition reaches Timbuktu and meets Mansa Mahmud II\n2. Treaty of Timbuktu signed: trading privileges, Christian quarter permitted\n3. Malian ambassador Musa Keita returns with expedition\n4. 600 pounds of gold ingots, detailed maps, formal agreements\n5. 13 of 32 expedition members died\n\nThis is fantastic - it's a huge success. The expedition was funded at 40,000 florins over three years and was organized through Prince Henry of Portugal. The Senegal outpost (São João da Ribeira) is already operational.\n\nNow I need to advance time from Summer 1438 to February 1439. During this time skip, several things should happen:\n- Lucia's pregnancy (child expected late 1438/early 1439) - she should have delivered\n- The expedition returns in February 1439\n\nI should also check if there are any other events that need to be addressed during this time skip. Let me narrate the arrival of the expedition with appropriate drama.\n\nBut first, I should check on the status of Lucia's pregnancy and any other events.\n\n\nThe expedition results were already determined with an exceptional roll of 91. Let me also check on what else happens during this time skip—particularly Queen Lucia's pregnancy.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Reconciled expedition outcomes and prepared childbirth resolution mechanics.\n\nBased on my search, I now have a clearer picture. Let me trace the chronology:\n\n- Lucia's pregnancy mentioned in Chapter 2.50 (Summer 1438) - \"Queen Lucia pregnant (child expected late 1438/early 1439)\"\n\nThe children so far are:\n1. Princess Catalina (b. January 1432) - Isabel's daughter\n2. Prince Fernando (b. August 1433) - Isabel's son (heir)\n3. Princess Bianca (b. September 1434) - Lucia's daughter\n4. Princess Teresa (b. September 1435) - Lucia's daughter  \n5. Princess Juana (b. November/December 1436) - Lucia's daughter\n6. Prince Nicolás (b. late 1437) - Lucia's son\n\nSo in 1438, there's another pregnancy mentioned. Let me check if there's a birth recorded for late 1438/early 1439.\n\nLooking at the Royal_Children_Database_1438.docx reference, there are six children listed:\n- Catalina (b. Jan 1432)\n- Fernando (b. Aug 1433)\n- Bianca (b. Sept 1434)\n- Teresa (b. Sept 1435)\n- Juana (b. Late 1436)\n- Nicolás (b. late 1437)\n\nSo the pregnancy in late 1438/early 1439 would be child #7. I should roll for this birth as we advance time.\n\nNow for the Mali expedition - Roll 91 (Exceptional Achievement) was already determined:\n- Expedition reaches Timbuktu and meets Mansa Mahmud II\n- Treaty of Timbuktu signed: trading privileges, Christian quarter permitted\n- Malian ambassador Musa Keita returns with expedition\n- 600 pounds of gold ingots, detailed maps, formal agreements\n- 13 of 32 expedition members died\n\n\nI'll prepare to document the next significant events, focusing on Lucia's potential childbirth and the expedition's return. I'll need to generate chaos rolls to determine the outcomes of these pivotal moments, tracking the potential new royal addition and the diplomatic implications of the Mali expedition's successful journey.\n\n\nI have the expedition results (Roll 91 - Exceptional Achievement was predetermined). However, we need to resolve Lucia's pregnancy first as we advance through autumn/winter. Let me create the necessary rolls.\n\n\n\nThe months pass. Summer fades to autumn, and autumn to winter.\n\n\nAutumn 1438 brings the routine rhythms of court life—harvest assessments, the annual Cortes convocation, the endless administrative details of managing an empire that now spans from the Atlantic to the Bosphorus. The treasury continues its remarkable growth as the silver refineries reach full operational capacity.\n\n\nIn late November, Queen Lucia enters her confinement. She has done this six times now—her body knows the work.\n\n\nLucia's Seventh Delivery\n\n\nI need you to roll a d100 for the delivery:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCatastrophic complications\n6-15\nSerious complications, extended recovery\n16-30\nDifficult but manageable, some risk\n31-60\nNormal delivery\n61-80\nSmooth delivery, quick recovery\n81-100\nEasy delivery, Lucia practically walks away\n\nIf the roll is 31 or higher, also roll a second d100 for gender:\n\n\n1-50: Daughter\n\n51-100: Son"

Let me search for recent chapter summaries in a different way to find this specific roll.\n\n\nTool: Looking for relevant chats in this project...\n\n\nThought process: Located prior roll result and prepared narrative advancement.\n\nI found it in the conversation search results. In Chapter 2.50, we rolled 94 on a d100 table for Lucia's pregnancy after her fourth child (Nicolás), and the result was:\n\n**Result: 94 — Difficult Path**\n*Lucia suffers a miscarriage in late 1438 or early 1439—painful but not life-threatening. She may conceive again afterward; roll again in Summer 1439.*\n\nSo this happened but hasn't been narrated yet. We need to advance time through autumn 1438 to February 1439, and during this time:\n1. Lucia's miscarriage occurs (late 1438/early 1439)\n2. The Mali/Timbuktu expedition returns (results expected 1439, Roll: 91 - Exceptional Achievement)\n\nLet me now narrate this properly.\n\n\nI found it. In Chapter 2.50, you rolled 94 on the conception table, which resulted in:\n\n\nResult: 94 — Difficult Path\nLucia suffers a miscarriage in late 1438 or early 1439—painful but not life-threatening. She may conceive again afterward; roll again in Summer 1439.\n\n\n\nThe months pass. Summer fades to autumn, autumn to the cold grey of winter.\n\n\nIn late December, the shadow falls.\n\n\nLucia loses the child in her eleventh week—too early for quickening, too late for ignorance. She wakes in the small hours with cramping and bleeding, and by dawn it is over. The royal physicians attend her with quiet competence. There is nothing to be done; these things happen, they say. One in four pregnancies ends this way, perhaps more. Her body will recover. She is young, healthy, proven fertile. There will be other children.\n\n\nJuan finds her pale and silent in their chambers that afternoon, staring at nothing. She does not weep—Lucia learned long ago in Ferrara that tears are a luxury the Estes cannot afford—but something has gone hollow behind those grey-green eyes.\n\n\n\"Four children in four years,\" she says at last, her voice flat. \"Perhaps God has decided that is enough for now.\"\n\n\nShe recovers physically within weeks. Emotionally, the winter passes slowly.\n\n\n\nFebruary 1439\n\n\nThe messenger arrives on a cold morning when frost still clings to the stones of the Alcázar courtyard. He wears Portuguese colors and bears dispatches from Prince Henry—and with him comes a small party of sun-darkened men who move with the particular weariness of those who have walked very far indeed.\n\n\nDon Álvaro brings the news to you in your solar, his face carefully composed but his eyes bright with something that might be wonder.\n\n\n\"The expedition has returned, Your Majesty. From Timbuktu.\" He pauses. \"They bring... rather more than we expected.\"\n\n\n\nThe Return of the Mali Expedition\n\n\nRoll 91: Exceptional Achievement (predetermined)\n\n\nOf the thirty-two men who departed São João da Ribeira on the Senegal River eighteen months ago, nineteen have returned. Thirteen lie buried in unmarked graves along the Niger—claimed by fever, accident, crocodile, and the simple grinding attrition of travel through lands no Christian had ever seen.\n\n\nBut those who survived have brought back treasures beyond imagination:\n\n\nThe Treaty of Timbuktu: A formal agreement with Mansa Mahmud II, ruler of the Mali Empire, granting trading privileges to Portuguese and Castilian merchants. The document is written in Arabic and bears the Mansa's seal—a lion rampant, worked in gold.\n\n\nThe Christian Quarter: Permission has been granted for a permanent Christian trading presence in Timbuktu itself. A small compound, nothing more—but the first foothold of Latin Christendom in the heart of Africa.\n\n\nGold: Six hundred pounds of gold ingots, packed in leather cases and guarded by men who understood what they carried. The expedition financed itself many times over.\n\n\nMaps: Detailed charts of the Niger River system, the routes between the coast and the interior, the locations of the great trading cities—Djenné, Timbuktu, Gao. Knowledge that exists nowhere else in Christendom.\n\n\nAnd an ambassador: Musa Keita, a nephew of the Mansa's chamberlain, has traveled back with the expedition. He is a tall man of perhaps thirty years, educated in the Islamic schools of Timbuktu, fluent in Arabic and passable in Portuguese learned during the journey. He bears gifts from his master and a desire to see the lands of the Christians for himself.\n\n\nDon Álvaro sets a leather pouch on the table before you. Inside, a single gold ingot gleams in the morning light.\n\n\n\"Prince Henry sends word that he has never seen anything like it,\" Álvaro says quietly. \"The expedition leader—Captain Gonçalves—says the gold simply flows from the mines of Bambuk. They trade salt for it, weight for weight. Salt, Your Majesty. Which we have in abundance.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"The African venture has succeeded beyond any reasonable hope.\"\n\n\n\nPresent in your solar are Don Álvaro de Luna and a clerk taking notes. The ambassador Musa Keita and the surviving expedition members await in the great hall below."

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated diplomatic response balancing cultural dignity and observational nuance.\n\nThe user (Juan) is greeting the Malian ambassador Musa Keita in Arabic. I need to portray Musa Keita responding - a educated man from Timbuktu, nephew of the Mansa's chamberlain, who has traveled an extraordinary distance to reach Castile. He's fluent in Arabic and has learned some Portuguese during the journey.\n\nI should consider:\n1. His perspective - he's from one of the richest cities in the world (Timbuktu was legendary for its wealth and learning)\n2. He's Muslim, educated in Islamic schools\n3. He's been traveling for many months through completely alien lands\n4. He's a diplomat, here to establish relations\n5. He would be observing Toledo with fresh eyes - what would strike him?\n\nToledo in 1439 would be impressive but also quite different from Timbuktu. Timbuktu was a center of Islamic learning with famous universities and libraries. The architecture, climate, religion, everything would be different.\n\nI should have Musa respond with dignity and diplomatic courtesy, but also with genuine observations. He shouldn't be overwhelmed or obsequious - Mali is a great empire in its own right, and Timbuktu is arguably more learned than most European cities at this time.\n\nLet me write this scene with appropriate cultural nuance.\n\n\nThe Malian ambassador is brought before you in the great hall. He moves with the unhurried dignity of a man accustomed to courts, though his eyes take in everything—the soaring Gothic arches, the Castilian tapestries, the crucifix above the throne. He wears robes of indigo-dyed cotton, finely woven, and a white turban that marks him as a man of learning. His skin is very dark, his features sharp and intelligent, his bearing that of one who knows his own worth.\n\n\nWhen you address him in Arabic, something shifts in his expression—surprise, perhaps, and then genuine pleasure.\n\n\n\"Wa aleikum as-salaam,\" Musa Keita replies, his Arabic fluid and educated, carrying the particular accent of the Saharan trade routes. He touches his hand to his heart. \"Peace be upon you also, O King of the Castilians.\"\n\n\nHe straightens, meeting your eyes with the directness of an equal addressing an equal—not insolence, but the confidence of a man who represents an empire that considers itself second to none.\n\n\n\"Your city is... cold,\" he says, and there is a flicker of wry humor in his voice. \"In Timbuktu, we complain when the harmattan wind brings dust from the desert. Here, water falls from the sky and turns to stone. I confess I did not believe the Portuguese when they told me of this. I thought it a traveler's tale, like the stories of men with heads in their chests.\"\n\n\nHe glances up at the vaulted ceiling, the narrow windows, the thick stone walls.\n\n\n\"Your buildings are made to keep out the cold, as ours are made to let in the air. Your people wrap themselves in wool and fur, as ours wrap ourselves in cotton and shade. Your God—\" he pauses, choosing his words carefully, \"—lives in buildings of stone, with images of men and saints. Our God lives in the words of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and forbids such images.\"\n\n\nA slight inclination of his head. \"Many things are different. But some things are the same. Kings rule, merchants trade, scholars argue, and gold—\" a faint smile touches his lips, \"—gold is gold, in Timbuktu as in Toledo.\"\n\n\nHe reaches into his robes and produces a small object wrapped in silk. Unfolding it, he reveals a book—small, beautifully bound in red leather, the pages covered in precise Arabic script.\n\n\n\"My master, Mansa Mahmud, Lord of Mali, Keeper of the Mines, sends this gift to the King of the Castilians. It is a treatise on geography by the scholar Ibn Battuta, who visited both your lands and ours a century ago. He found much to admire in each.\" Musa Keita extends the book. \"The Mansa hopes that what Ibn Battuta began, we may continue—a friendship between peoples who have much to offer one another.\"\n\n\nHis dark eyes hold yours, waiting."

This is a diplomatic conversation about trade negotiations. I should have Musa Keita respond with what Mali actually needs/wants - historically, the trans-Saharan trade involved salt (which was extremely valuable in sub-Saharan Africa), horses, textiles, metalwork, and other goods.\n\nLet me think about what Mali would realistically want:\n1. Salt - extremely valuable, traded weight-for-weight for gold\n2. Horses - cavalry was prestigious and militarily important, but horses didn't survive well in the tsetse fly zones\n3. Metalwork - swords, armor, tools\n4. Textiles - fine cloth, especially from Europe\n5. Books and learning - Timbuktu was a center of Islamic scholarship\n6. Possibly weapons\n\nI should have Musa Keita be a sophisticated diplomat who understands trade and can articulate Mali's interests clearly. He should be respectful but also confident - Mali is a wealthy empire and doesn't need to beg.\n\n\nMusa Keita nods, his expression thoughtful.\n\n\n\"Your Captain Gonçalves spoke much with our merchants in Timbuktu,\" he says. \"He was a man of intelligence, may God preserve him. He understood quickly what we value.\"\n\n\nThe ambassador begins to count on his fingers in the manner of scholars.\n\n\n\"First and always, salt. The mines of Taghaza produce much, but never enough. Your Portuguese friends tell me you have salt in abundance along your coasts—great pans where the sea itself is transformed to white gold. In Bambuk, in Bure, men will trade gold dust measure for measure against salt. This your people have already seen.\"\n\n\nA second finger. \"Horses. The finest horses of Arabia and the Maghreb reach us only after long journeys across the desert, and many die. Those that survive are worth fortunes. Our cavalry is the arm of the Mansa's power, but the sickness of the southern lands kills horses faster than we can replace them. If you could bring horses by sea to the Senegal...\" He spreads his hands. \"You would find eager buyers.\"\n\n\nA third finger. \"Steel. Swords, spear-points, tools. We have smiths, good smiths, but the iron of your lands is said to be superior. Weapons of Toledo steel would command high prices.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, and something more complex enters his expression.\n\n\n\"And there is a fourth thing, though it is not a thing of merchants.\" He touches the book he has just presented. \"Timbuktu is a city of scholars. The Sankoré mosque holds manuscripts beyond counting—theology, law, medicine, mathematics, poetry. We have learned much from the lands of Islam. But there are other learnings in the world.\" His eyes meet yours. \"The Portuguese priest who traveled with the expedition—Father Álvares—he spoke of universities in your lands. Of books translated from the Greek. Of knowledge preserved from ancient times.\"\n\n\nMusa Keita's voice grows quieter, more intent. \"The Mansa is a devout Muslim, as am I. But he is also a king who understands that knowledge is power. If there were... exchanges. Scholars who might visit, books that might be copied. Such things would be valued highly in Timbuktu. Perhaps more highly than salt.\"\n\n\nHe allows a small smile. \"Though the merchants would still prefer the salt.\""

This is a realistic concern - medieval European universities operated in Latin primarily, with Greek for classical texts, and vernacular languages like Castilian for some purposes. Arabic scholarship was known in Europe largely through translation (the Toledo School of Translators had been famous for this in earlier centuries).\n\nI should have Musa Keita respond realistically - he's an educated man who would understand this challenge. He might mention that Arabic was actually the bridge language that brought much Greek knowledge to Europe in the first place, or he might have practical suggestions. He should be thoughtful and diplomatic.\n\n\nMusa Keita inclines his head, acknowledging the point.\n\n\n\"A hurdle, yes. But perhaps not so high as you imagine.\" His tone carries the patience of a teacher. \"In Timbuktu, we read Aristotle and Ptolemy and Galen—but we read them in Arabic, translated long ago by scholars in Baghdad and Córdoba. Your own ancestors, I am told, learned much of this Greek wisdom through Arabic translations made here in al-Andalus, in this very land, before your great-grandfathers conquered it.\"\n\n\nHe gestures, a flowing movement of the hand. \"The river of knowledge has flowed in many directions.

Latin I do not know. But there are men in Timbuktu who have studied in Fez and Cairo, who know something of the languages of the Christians. And there are men in your lands, I think, who still remember Arabic—converts, perhaps, or the children of converts. Men who might serve as bridges.\"\n\n\nHis dark eyes study you with something like respect. \"You speak Arabic yourself, O King. This is not common among Christian princes, I think.

This is a significant statement given the context of the Reconquista and the treatment of Muslims in Iberia.\n\nAs a diplomat from Mali, Musa Keita would be aware of the situation of Muslims in Iberia - the gradual Christian conquest, the status of mudéjares (Muslims living under Christian rule), and the general trajectory of things.

This is a negotiation/information exchange with the ambassador Musa Keita.\n\nLet me think about what Musa Keita would realistically know and be authorized to discuss:\n\n1. He's an ambassador, not a merchant - he may have general knowledge but not specific trade quotas\n2. Mali's gold production was enormous - the famous Mansa Musa's pilgrimage to Mecca reportedly crashed gold prices in Cairo\n3. The trade routes historically went north across the Sahara to North Africa - this was the traditional route\n4. The Portuguese sea route via the Senegal River is new and would represent a significant shift\n5. The Mansa would probably not commit to specific quantities without seeing how the trade develops\n\nMusa Keita should be able to discuss:\n- General willingness to trade\n- The routes available (trans-Saharan vs. coastal/river)\n- What factors would influence Mali's preferences\n- Perhaps some sense of scale\n\nBut he probably can't commit to:\n- Specific quantities\n- Exclusive arrangements\n- Anything that would upset Mali's existing trade relationships with North African merchants\n\nThe trans-Saharan trade was controlled by various middlemen - Tuareg, Berber merchants, etc. Shifting to a sea route would upset these relationships. Mali would need to balance these concerns.\n\nLet me have Musa Keita give a thoughtful diplomatic response that addresses the practical realities.\n\n\nMusa Keita's expression shifts subtly—the scholar giving way to the diplomat, the man who understands that poetry and philosophy are pleasant, but gold is why he has traveled four thousand miles.\n\n\n\"The Mansa does not sell gold, O King,\" he says carefully. \"He trades gold. This distinction matters in Timbuktu.\"\n\n\nHe begins to pace slowly, hands clasped behind his back—the posture of a man organizing his thoughts.\n\n\n\"The mines of Bambuk and Bure produce much. How much?\" He spreads his hands. \"This I cannot say with certainty. The miners are secretive. They trade with the Mansa's merchants, and the merchants trade with the caravans, and the caravans carry the gold north to Sijilmasa and Tunis and Cairo. Some years more, some years less. But the river of gold has flowed for centuries and shows no sign of drying.\"\n\n\nHe turns to face you directly.\n\n\n\"As for routes—here is where matters grow delicate.\" His voice drops slightly, though there is no one close enough to overhear. \"For generations beyond counting, the gold has traveled north. Across the desert. The Tuareg guide the caravans. The merchants of the Maghreb buy and sell. The sultans of Morocco and Tunis grow rich on the trade. These are... established relationships. Old relationships. Relationships with swords behind them.\"\n\n\nA pause, weighted with meaning.\n\n\n\"If the Mansa were to send his gold west, down the Senegal to the sea, to ships flying Portuguese and Castilian flags...\" He lets the implication hang. \"The Sultan of Morocco would not be pleased. The Tuareg would not be pleased. Men who have grown wealthy on the northern trade would find themselves... less wealthy.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"The Mansa is powerful, but he is not foolish. He will not abandon the northern trade entirely—that would make enemies he does not need. But he is interested in alternatives. In not being dependent on a single road that others control.\"\n\n\nMusa Keita allows himself a thin smile. \"So. To answer your question: the Mansa is prepared to trade gold through the Senegal route. Cautiously, at first. Perhaps—\" he considers, \"—a few hundred pounds each year to begin. Enough to test the arrangement. Enough to see if your ships come reliably, if your merchants deal honestly, if the route is safe from pirates and rivals.\"\n\n\nHe holds up a finger. \"And if all goes well? If trust is built? Then perhaps the river of gold might split into two streams—one flowing north as it always has, and one flowing west to the sea. How large that western stream might grow...\" He shrugs. \"That depends on you, O King. On what you offer, and how you offer it. On whether your deeds match your words.\"\n\n\nHis dark eyes are sharp. \"What can you offer? How many ships? How much salt? How reliably?\""

Salt quantities and needs\n2. The practical challenges of armor in West African heat\n3. What kind of military equipment would actually be useful in Mali\n4. Perhaps showing appreciation for Juan's practical thinking\n\nI should have Musa Keita respond as an intelligent diplomat who appreciates Juan's practical approach and knowledge. He should discuss the realities of warfare in the Sahel region - the heat, the types of enemies they face, etc.\n\nLet me think about what Mali would actually need:\n- Salt: enormous quantities - this was literally traded weight-for-weight with gold in some cases\n- Horses: cavalry was crucial for Mali's military power, but horses died quickly from trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) carried by tsetse flies in the wetter southern regions\n- Armor: heavy European plate armor would be impractical in the Saharan heat. Chain mail or lighter protection would be more useful\n- Weapons: Toledo steel swords, spear points, crossbows perhaps\n\nMusa Keita should be impressed by Juan's practical thinking about armor in different climates - this shows Juan is thinking seriously about the realities of their situation, not just trying to dump European goods on them.\n\n\nMusa Keita's expression warms—the look of a man who has braced himself for ignorance and found understanding instead.\n\n\n\"You ask the right questions, O King. Many would simply offer their finest plate armor and expect gratitude.\" He shakes his head. \"A man wearing such armor in the sun of the Sahel would cook like meat in a pot. I have seen your knights in their steel shells. Magnificent for your cold lands. Death in ours.\"\n\n\nHe considers the question seriously.\n\n\n\"What we need is lighter. Chain mail, perhaps—what you call loriga, I think? It turns a blade but lets the air pass through. Helmets that shade the face but do not trap the heat. And padding beneath that breathes.\" He touches his own robes. \"Cotton, not wool. Our warriors wrap themselves in quilted cotton that stops arrows better than you might imagine. But against a steel blade...\" He makes a cutting gesture. \"Chain mail beneath cotton would be formidable.\"\n\n\nOn the matter of horses, his expression grows more animated.\n\n\n\"Horses are our greatest need and our greatest sorrow. The finest Arabian stallions reach us from the north—we pay fortunes for them. They sire foals, they carry our warriors into battle, they make the Mansa's cavalry the terror of our enemies.\" His voice darkens. \"And then they sicken. A wasting disease. Flies that bite and bring death. In the southern provinces, near the forests, a horse may live only two or three years. We must constantly replace them.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you with sudden intensity. \"If you could bring horses by sea to the Senegal—horses of quality, horses already accustomed to heat—you would find buyers who would pay in gold without haggling. The Mansa himself would take interest.\"\n\n\nReturning to salt, he spreads his hands wide.\n\n\n\"How much salt? O King, I do not think you understand. In Timbuktu, salt is cut into blocks and used as currency. In the southern lands, men have never tasted salt in their lives—they burn certain plants and lick the ashes for the taste of it. A camel-load of salt from Taghaza, carried south to the gold lands, can purchase its weight in gold.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, letting that sink in.\n\n\n\"The northern caravans bring perhaps... two thousand camel-loads each year? More in good years, less when the desert is cruel. If you could bring even a fraction of that by sea—five hundred loads, a thousand—you would reshape the trade of an empire.\" His eyes narrow thoughtfully. \"But you would also make enemies of those who control the northern routes. The Marinid Sultan. The Tuareg lords. Men who would not sit idle while their wealth flows elsewhere.\"\n\n\nHe tilts his head. \"Does this concern you, O King? Morocco is closer to your lands than Mali is.\""

This is a practical question about trade logistics. Álvaro would need to either know this from general knowledge or admit uncertainty.\n\nLet me think about what Álvaro might know:\n- Álvaro is a skilled administrator and politician, but not necessarily a merchant or caravan trader\n- He might have some general knowledge from Castile's interactions with North Africa\n- A camel's carrying capacity is generally around 200-300 kg (440-660 lbs) for long journeys, though they can carry more for shorter distances\n- Salt blocks from the Saharan mines (like Taghaza) were typically cut into specific sizes for transport\n\nI should have Álvaro respond - he may know approximately or may need to defer to merchants or make an educated guess. He's a competent administrator so he might have some idea, but this is specialized knowledge about trans-Saharan trade.\n\nLet me portray Álvaro realistically - he's intelligent and well-informed, but this is quite specific trade knowledge about African caravans.\n\n\nDon Álvaro steps forward, his brow furrowed in thought. He is a man of politics and war, not caravans, but he has administered a kingdom long enough to know something of trade.\n\n\n\"I am not certain, Your Majesty,\" he admits frankly. \"Camels are not common in Castile. But I have heard merchants speak of the African trade.\" He glances briefly at Musa Keita, then back to you. \"I believe a camel carries perhaps three or four quintales on a long journey? More on shorter routes, but the desert crossing is punishing.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, calculating. \"A quintal is roughly a hundred pounds. So perhaps three hundred to four hundred pounds of salt per beast, if the journey is long.\"\n\n\nMusa Keita nods, confirming. \"Your minister is close. A strong camel carries four slabs of salt from Taghaza—each slab perhaps eighty to one hundred pounds. Call it three hundred and fifty pounds in your measure, sometimes four hundred. Less if the beast is weak or the journey difficult.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's eyes narrow as he works through the implications. \"Two thousand camel-loads at three hundred fifty pounds each... that is seven hundred thousand pounds of salt crossing the desert each year. If we could capture even a quarter of that trade through the Senegal route...\"\n\n\nHe looks at you. \"Your Majesty, we produce far more salt than that along the Andalusian coast alone.

Let me compile this for Álvaro's response. The numbers seem to be in some unit - probably quintales or similar. Let me look more carefully at the data structure to understand the columns.\n\nFrom the data:\n- Burgos: 6,500 production, 14,000 consumption, -7,500 balance (net importer)\n- Sevilla: 8,000 production, 12,000 consumption, -4,000 balance (net importer)\n- Granada: 1,600 production, 2,200 consumption, -600 balance (net importer)\n- Barcelona: 22,000 production, 8,000 consumption, 14,000 surplus, 12,000 exports - IBIZA SALT\n- Valencia: 8,000 production, 4,000 consumption, 4,000 surplus, 3,000 exports\n- Lisbon: 65,000 production, 15,000 consumption, 50,000 surplus, 48,000 exports - SETÚBAL/AVEIRO\n- Naples: 18,000 production, 20,000 consumption, -2,000 balance (net importer)\n- Sicily: 55,000 production, 12,000 consumption, 43,000 surplus, 40,000 exports - TRAPANI SALT\n- Constantinople: 8,000 production, 10,000 consumption, -2,000 balance (net importer)\n\nSo in Juan's realm (Castile, Aragon, Naples, Sicily):\n- Castile (Burgos, Sevilla, Granada): 16,100 production\n- Aragon (Barcelona, Valencia): 30,000 production\n- Naples: 18,000 production\n- Sicily: 55,000 production\n- Total: ~119,100 units\n\nPortugal (ally): 65,000 production\n\nThe units are probably quintales (100 pounds each). Let me convert:\n\n\nI'll calculate the total salt production in pounds, focusing on Juan's territories and Portugal. The combined production reveals a substantial salt surplus that far exceeds the Mali trade requirements. Specifically, Juan's realm generates around 11.9 million pounds, with Portugal contributing an additional 6.5 million pounds. This massive production makes the proposed 700,000-pound trade to Mali seem relatively insignificant, representing less than 4% of the total available salt.\n\n\nDon Álvaro moves to the table where the trade ledgers lie—documents you had reviewed just months ago with Diego de Daza. He pages through them quickly, his administrator's eye finding the relevant figures.\n\n\n\"Salt production across your domains, Your Majesty...\" He traces a finger down the columns, muttering as he calculates.\n\n\n\"Castile proper—Cádiz, the coastal pans near Seville, Granada's shores—perhaps sixteen thousand quintales annually. Much of that consumed locally.\" He turns a page. \"But Aragon brings far more. The salt of Ibiza is famous throughout the Mediterranean—Barcelona alone exports twelve thousand quintales. Valencia adds another three thousand.\"\n\n\nHe looks up. \"And then there is Sicily. The salt pans of Trapani have operated since Phoenician times. Forty thousand quintales exported each year, perhaps more. It is one of the great salt ports of the inner sea.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down the ledger. \"In total, Your Majesty, your realms produce well over one hundred thousand quintales of salt annually. At one hundred pounds per quintal, that is...\" he pauses, calculating, \"...ten million pounds, perhaps more. And Portugal—\" he glances at Musa Keita, \"—our ally King Duarte's realm produces another sixty-five thousand quintales from Setúbal and Aveiro. The finest sea salt in Christendom, the English say.\"\n\n\nHe straightens. \"The ambassador spoke of seven hundred thousand pounds crossing the Sahara each year. We produce fifteen times that amount.\" A thin smile. \"Salt is not our constraint, Your Majesty. Ships and safe passage are.\"\n\n\nMusa Keita's eyebrows rise slightly at the figures. He says nothing, but you sense calculations occurring behind those dark eyes—the same calculations any merchant makes when he discovers his trading partner has far more to offer than expected."

The infrastructure exists, the labor exists, the ships exist. Expansion there would be fastest and cheapest. But...\" he pauses, \"Sicily is Alfonso's domain, not yours directly. Any expansion would require his cooperation and would enrich Aragonese coffers as much as Castilian ones.\"\n\n\nHe traces west across the map. \"Third—Cádiz and the Andalusian coast. Good conditions for salt pans, and it lies closest to the Atlantic routes. The salinas there are modest now, but the coastline is long and suitable. Expansion would take time—digging new pans, building infrastructure—but it would be entirely under Castilian control, and the salt would be closest to the ships bound for Africa.\"\n\n\nFinally, his finger moves to Portugal. \"Fourth—Setúbal. The Portuguese produce more salt than anyone except Sicily. King Duarte is your ally, your brother by marriage. If you wished to purchase Portuguese salt for the African trade rather than produce your own...\" He shrugs. \"It would be faster, though it would make you dependent on Portuguese goodwill and Portuguese prices.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro turns from the map. \"There is also the matter of Granada's coast. The Moors had salt works there, some still operating. The coastline between Málaga and Almería has potential, but it has been barely five years since the conquest. The region is still settling. Labor would need to come from the north.\"\n\n\nHe sits back down, reaching for his wine at last.\n\n\n\"My counsel, Your Majesty? If you wish to move quickly, expand Trapani—the Sicilians know the work, and forty thousand quintales could become sixty or eighty with investment. If you wish to build something entirely your own, invest in the Andalusian coast—Cádiz, Sanlúcar, perhaps new works near the mouth of the Guadalquivir. It will take longer, but the salt will flow from Castilian soil to Castilian ships to African gold.\"\n\n\nHe drinks, then sets down the cup. \"How much salt are you thinking of producing? The ambassador spoke of seven hundred thousand pounds crossing the desert. To match that from sea salt would require...\" he calculates silently, \"...seven thousand quintales dedicated entirely to the African trade. We produce that much in Cádiz alone. To overwhelm the desert trade—to make Taghaza irrelevant—would require far more. Perhaps fifty thousand quintales annually, shipped reliably, year after year.\"\n\n\nHis eyes meet yours. \"It can be done. The question is how much you wish to spend, and how quickly you wish to move.\""

There is no such thing as too much salt.\"\n\n\nHe begins sketching figures on the parchment.\n\n\n\"A two-pronged approach, then. Let us say...\"\n\n\nSicily - Trapani Expansion\n\n\n\"Trapani already produces forty thousand quintales for export. The salt flats there are ancient, well-established, the workers skilled. To expand production by half again—another twenty thousand quintales—would require enlarging the existing pans and hiring more laborers. Sicilians will do the work; the wages are good by local standards.\"\n\n\nHe writes a figure. \"I estimate perhaps fifteen thousand florins for initial construction—digging new evaporation pans, building storage, improving the quays for loading. Then ongoing costs for labor, perhaps five thousand florins annually above current expenses. Within two years, Trapani could produce sixty thousand quintales instead of forty.\"\n\n\nAtlantic Coast - Andalusia\n\n\n\"This is the harder work, but the more important for the African trade. Ships from Cádiz and Sanlúcar reach the Canaries in ten days, the Senegal in perhaps a month with good winds. Sicilian salt would need to sail west through the Strait of Gibraltar first—possible, but longer.\"\n\n\nHe sketches a rough coastline. \"The Bay of Cádiz has suitable conditions—shallow tidal flats, strong sun, steady winds. There are small salinas already, but nothing on the scale we need. To build new works capable of producing twenty thousand quintales annually...\"\n\n\nHe frowns, calculating. \"Thirty thousand florins, perhaps more. We must dig the pans, build sea walls to control the tides, construct warehouses, bring workers from inland. It is three years' work at minimum before the first large harvests. But once built, the annual costs are modest—salt harvests itself, given sun and time. Perhaps eight thousand florins yearly for labor and maintenance.\"\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down his quill and looks at the figures.\n\n\n\"Initial investment: forty-five thousand florins across both sites. Annual ongoing costs: thirteen thousand florins above current expenses. Time to full production: two to three years for Trapani expansion, three to four for the Andalusian works.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"By 1442 or 1443, Your Majesty, you could be producing an additional forty thousand quintales annually—four million pounds of salt beyond what we already harvest.

Ownership model - Should the Crown own these salt production facilities directly, or lease/license them to merchants? This is a significant economic policy question.\n\n2. Logistics - How many ships would be needed to transport all this salt to Africa?\n\nLet me think through both:\n\n**Ownership Models:**\n\nHistorically, salt production could be:\n- Crown monopoly (direct ownership)\n- Licensed/leased to private operators who pay royalties\n- Mixed model\n\nDon Álvaro should present options here. Direct crown ownership means more profit but also more administrative burden. Licensing to merchants means less direct profit but also less risk and less management overhead.\n\n**Ship Calculations:**\n\nLet's work out the math:\n- 40,000 quintales = 4,000,000 pounds of salt\n- A medieval carrack could carry perhaps 200-400 tons of cargo\n- A ton is 2,000 pounds\n- So a carrack carries 400,000 - 800,000 pounds\n\nWait, that seems too high. Let me reconsider.\n\nA 15th century carrack might have a capacity of 200-600 tons burden (the larger ones). A caravel was smaller - maybe 50-100 tons.\n\nFor the African coastal trade, they'd likely use smaller vessels - caravels.\n\nA caravel of 50 tons burden could carry roughly 50 tons = 100,000 pounds.\n\nSo 4,000,000 pounds / 100,000 pounds per caravel = 40 caravel loads\n\nBut they wouldn't send it all at once - they'd send regular convoys.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The user asked about \"twice Taghaza\" which was 1.4 million pounds, not 4 million.\n\nIf we're talking about the African-dedicated salt:\n- 1.4 million pounds for Africa\n- A caravel carries maybe 50-80 tons = 100,000-160,000 pounds\n\n\n- So roughly 9-14 caravel loads for the African trade\n\nFor the full production, I'll calculate annual shipping needs. The African trade requires 9-14 caravels, while total production might need 25-40 ships annually. These shipments would be strategically spread throughout the year, making the logistics manageable for Don Álvaro's maritime planning.\n\n\nDon Álvaro pauses, setting down his quill. A faint smile crosses his weathered face—the expression of a man pleased to be asked the right questions.\n\n\n\"Two excellent questions, Your Majesty. Let me address them in turn.\"\n\n\n\nOn Ownership\n\n\n\"I confess I was speaking loosely. Crown ownership of salt production is... possible, but perhaps not wise.\" He steeples his fingers. \"Consider the alternatives.\"\n\n\n\"Direct Crown ownership means the Crown bears all costs—construction, maintenance, labor, supervision. We hire the workers, we manage the operations, we sell the salt. All profit flows to the treasury, but so does all risk. If a storm destroys the pans, the Crown pays to rebuild. If workers demand higher wages, the Crown pays. If the salt spoils in storage, the Crown absorbs the loss. And we must employ administrators to oversee it all—men who might otherwise serve the realm in other ways.\"\n\n\nHe shakes his head slowly. \"This is how your silver mines operate, and it makes sense there—silver is too valuable, too strategic, to leave in private hands. But salt?\"\n\n\n\"The alternative is what we do with most productive lands. The Crown builds the infrastructure—the pans, the sea walls, the basic warehouses—then leases the operation to merchants or local concejos. They pay a fixed rent, or perhaps a share of production—one fifth, one quarter, whatever we negotiate. They bear the costs of labor and maintenance. They assume the daily risks. We receive steady income without steady headaches.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"The profit per quintal is lower, but the profit is certain. And we can always insert a clause requiring them to sell a portion of their production to Crown agents at fixed prices—ensuring we have salt for the African trade without managing the harvest ourselves.\"\n\n\n\"My recommendation? Build the infrastructure with Crown funds, then lease the operations. Keep perhaps one or two salinas under direct Crown control as a reserve and a check on prices, but let merchants do what merchants do best.\"\n\n\n\nOn Ships\n\n\nÁlvaro reaches for a fresh piece of parchment, his quill moving quickly.\n\n\n\"Let us calculate. You speak of forty thousand additional quintales annually—four million pounds of salt.\"\n\n\n\"A caravel of the type Prince Henry uses for African exploration carries perhaps fifty to sixty tons of cargo. A ton is roughly two thousand pounds. So one caravel carries one hundred thousand to one hundred twenty thousand pounds.\"\n\n\nHe writes the figures. \"Four million pounds divided by one hundred thousand pounds per ship... forty caravel voyages per year to move the entire production.\"\n\n\nHe looks up. \"But we would not send it all to Africa. You yourself said we would sell to European markets as well. If half goes to Africa and half to Europe...\"\n\n\n\"Twenty caravel loads for the African trade annually. Perhaps four or five voyages per ship if the route is established and the winds favorable—the journey to Senegal and back might take two to three months, so a ship could make three or four round trips per year.\"\n\n\nHe taps the parchment. \"Five to seven caravels dedicated to the African salt trade could move twenty shiploads per year. More if we use larger vessels—a carrack carries three or four times what a caravel does, but caravels are better suited to coastal work and shallow river mouths.\"\n\n\nA pause. \"We do not have five caravels sitting idle, Your Majesty. We would need to build them, or purchase them from Portugal, or contract with Portuguese captains who already know the route.\" He glances toward the window. \"Prince Henry has caravels. King Duarte has caravels. This might be another point of negotiation with our Portuguese friends—or a reason to expand our own shipyards.\"\n\n\nHe sets down the quill. \"Shall I include shipbuilding estimates in the planning? Or do you wish to approach King Duarte about a joint venture, given that the Senegal outpost is already Portuguese?\""

They said \"Carex\" which I believe is a voice transcription error for \"carracks.\"\n\nThis is a good question about naval technology and the practical differences between ship types for the African coastal trade. Let me think about what Álvaro would say:\n\n1. Carracks are larger cargo ships - they can carry much more\n2. But they have deeper drafts (sit lower in the water)\n3. The Senegal River and African coastal waters are often shallow\n4. Caravels were specifically designed by the Portuguese for exploration - they have shallow drafts and can navigate close to shore and up rivers\n5. Caravels are also more maneuverable and can sail closer to the wind (lateen rigged)\n6. Carracks would struggle in shallow river mouths and might need to anchor offshore and transfer cargo to smaller boats\n\nSo Álvaro should explain the practical reasons why caravels are preferred for this specific route, while acknowledging that carracks could potentially work for parts of the journey.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods, having anticipated the question.\n\n\n\"We can, Your Majesty. Carracks would indeed carry far more—three hundred tons or more, compared to a caravel's fifty or sixty. Fewer voyages, fewer crews, more salt per ship.\" He holds up a finger. \"But there are complications.\"\n\n\nHe moves to the map, tracing the African coastline with his finger.\n\n\n\"The Senegal River is not the Guadalquivir. It is shallow in places, with sandbars that shift with the seasons. The Portuguese outpost at São João da Ribeira lies upriver, not on the open coast. A carrack draws twelve, fifteen feet of water when fully loaded. A caravel draws six or eight.\"\n\n\nHis finger taps the river mouth. \"A carrack laden with salt might run aground before it ever reaches the trading post. The Portuguese use caravels for precisely this reason—they can navigate coastal waters, river mouths, and shallow harbors where a carrack would founder.\"\n\n\nHe steps back from the map. \"Now, there are ways around this. We could anchor carracks offshore and transfer cargo to smaller boats—lighters, barges, even caravels—for the final approach. The Venetians and Genoese do this in ports too shallow for their great ships. But it adds time, labor, and risk. Cargo must be loaded and unloaded twice. Men must be paid. Goods can be damaged or lost in the transfer.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro returns to his seat. \"For a route we sail once or twice, the inconvenience is bearable. For a trade we wish to conduct dozens of times each year, for decades?\" He shakes his head. \"Caravels are purpose-built for this work. The Portuguese spent years perfecting them for African exploration—shallow draft, lateen sails that work well against contrary winds, nimble enough to escape danger.\"\n\n\nA pause. \"That said, Your Majesty, nothing prevents us from using carracks for the first leg of the journey—Cádiz to the Canaries, perhaps, or even to Cape Bojador. Large loads, open ocean, deep harbors. Then transfer the salt to caravels for the coastal and river work.\" He shrugs. \"It is more complex, but it might prove more efficient at scale.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"Do you wish me to consult with Admiral Vilaragut on the practical details?

A man cannot plan expansion without knowing what his salt will fetch five years hence.\"\n\n\nThere is no challenge in his voice—merely the caution of a merchant who has learned that royal promises can shift with royal priorities.\n\n\nGiacomo Ferrante clears his throat. His Castilian is rough, heavily accented, but comprehensible.\n\n\n\"Maestà—Your Majesty—\" he corrects himself, \"in Trapani, we make salt the same way for five hundred years. Sun, wind, sea, time. The land knows the work. The people know the work.\" He taps one of his diagrams with a calloused finger. \"You want twenty thousand quintales more? This I can do. But not tomorrow. Not next year, maybe.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"Salt pans are not... not wheat fields. You do not plant in spring and harvest in autumn. First we must dig. Then the sea must fill. Then the sun must dry. Then the maestri must know when to move the water, when to rake, when to harvest. One mistake—\" he snaps his fingers, \"—the whole season, ruined. Bitter salt. Brown salt. Salt that no merchant will buy.\"\n\n\nFerrante looks at Don Rodrigo, then back to you. \"In Sicily, I can expand. The coast has room. But I need three things: soldi—money—for digging and walls. Workers who will come to Trapani and stay. And time. Three years minimum before new pans produce good salt. Four is better.\"\n\n\nHe crosses his arms. \"Also, I must ask—this salt, where does it go? Don Álvaro says Africa. Trapani salt goes east—to Venice, to Genoa, to Constantinople. If we make more salt for Africa, do we lose our eastern buyers? The Venetians pay well. They pay reliably. I do not know these African merchants.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo nods slowly, seizing on the point. \"Maestro Ferrante raises a fair concern, Your Majesty. New markets are well and good, but we have existing customers, existing relationships. If the Crown wishes to redirect our salt to Africa, we must know that the African trade will be as profitable—and as dependable—as what we sacrifice.\"\n\n\nHe folds his hands. \"What does the Crown propose for a price per quintal?

Construction projects often took longer than planned.\n\nLet me create a realistic table:\n\n\nChaos Roll: Salt Production Expansion Program (1439-1444)\n\n\nFive-year program to expand salt production at Trapani (Sicily) and establish new works along the Andalusian coast (Cádiz region). Initial Crown investment: 45,000 florins. Target: 40,000 additional quintales annually by 1443-1444.\n\n\nFavorable factors:\n\n\nExperienced Sicilian maestro salinero (Giacomo Ferrante) overseeing Trapani expansion\n\nEstablished Ponce family with three generations of expertise managing Cádiz works\n\nExisting infrastructure at Trapani to build upon\n\nStrong market demand (African trade, European markets)\n\nProven climate conditions in both regions\n\nPolitical stability under unified Crown rule\n\nSubstantial Crown investment in infrastructure\n\n\nRisk factors:\n\n\nAndalusian works are entirely new construction (longer timeline, more uncertainty)\n\nLabor must be recruited and retained in both regions\n\nUnseasonable weather (excessive rain, storms) can ruin salt harvests\n\nConstruction projects historically prone to delays and cost overruns\n\nCompetition from Portuguese and North African salt may affect prices\n\nDisease outbreaks could disrupt labor force\n\nSea walls and pans vulnerable to storm damage\n\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDisaster. Severe storms destroy Andalusian construction in Year 2 or 3; major flooding damages Trapani pans. Significant rebuilding required. By 1444, only 15,000 additional quintales achieved—less than 40% of target. Additional 20,000 florins needed to recover.\n6-15\nSignificant setbacks. Labor shortages plague Andalusia; disputes with workers at Trapani over wages. Construction delays push Andalusian completion to 1445. Unseasonable rains ruin one full harvest at Trapani. By 1444, only 22,000-25,000 additional quintales achieved (~60% of target).\n16-30\nBelow expectations. Minor construction delays, higher costs than projected (55,000 florins total instead of 45,000). Andalusian works produce good salt but not at full capacity by 1444. Trapani expansion meets targets. Total additional production: 30,000-32,000 quintales (75-80% of target).\n31-50\nAdequate progress. Program proceeds roughly as planned. Minor weather disruptions, normal construction challenges. Trapani expansion complete by 1442; Andalusian works operational by late 1443 but not at full capacity until 1445. By 1444: 35,000 additional quintales (~85% of target). Costs within 10% of budget.\n51-70\nMeets expectations. Both expansions proceed on schedule. Trapani produces additional 20,000 quintales by 1442. Andalusian works operational by mid-1443, reaching near-full capacity by 1444. Total additional production: 38,000-40,000 quintales. Costs as budgeted.\n71-85\nExceeds expectations. Favorable weather, skilled workforce, efficient management. Trapani expansion complete early (1441), Andalusian works ahead of schedule. Quality of Cádiz salt proves excellent—commands premium prices. By 1444: 42,000-45,000 additional quintales. Costs 5-10% under budget.\n86-95\nRemarkable success. Exceptional conditions across all five years. Ferrante's expertise transforms Trapani into the most efficient salt operation in the Mediterranean. Ponce family innovations at Cádiz create model for future expansion. By 1444: 48,000-52,000 additional quintales (~120-130% of target). European merchants compete for contracts.\n96-100\nExtraordinary achievement. Perfect weather, no labor disputes, construction ahead of schedule, both maestri prove exceptional. Discovery of ideal new salt flat locations along Andalusian coast allows additional expansion at minimal cost. By 1444: 55,000+ additional quintales. The Crown's salt operation becomes legendary. Other kingdoms send observers to study your methods.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed favorable conditions against risks for African expansion table.\n\nThe player rolled 64 on the salt production expansion, which falls in the 51-70 range: \"Meets expectations.\" Both expansions proceed on schedule. Trapani produces additional 20,000 quintales by 1442. Andalusian works operational by mid-1443, reaching near-full capacity by 1444. Total additional production: 38,000-40,000 quintales. Costs as budgeted.\n\nNow I need to draft a d100 table for establishing outposts along the African route, expanding the Senegal River trading post, and procuring/dedicating ships for the salt-gold trade. This is a five-year program (1439-1444) as well.\n\nLet me think about the factors:\n\nFavorable factors:\n- Already have São João da Ribeira outpost operational on Senegal\n- Portuguese expertise and cooperation (Prince Henry, King Duarte)\n- Canary Islands as waypoint (Castilian)\n- Madeira as Portuguese waypoint\n- Successful Timbuktu expedition (Roll 91) established good relations with Mali\n- Ambassador Musa Keita present to facilitate negotiations\n- Strong financial position (treasury over 1 million florins)\n- Treaty of Timbuktu already grants trading privileges\n- Salt production program meeting expectations (Roll 64)\n\nRisk factors:\n- Uncharted coastline between Canaries and Senegal\n- Need to find suitable harbor locations with fresh water\n- Hostile local populations possible\n- Disease (tropical diseases devastating to Europeans)\n- Portuguese may be protective of their African monopoly (though allied)\n- Marinid Sultan of Morocco may interfere\n- Shipbuilding/procurement takes time\n- Caravels needed specifically for shallow coastal work\n- Sailors unfamiliar with African waters\n- Storm damage, shipwrecks possible\n- Maintaining garrison at remote outposts difficult\n\nThis is a complex, multi-faceted operation over five years. Let me build the table.\n\n\nResult: 64 — Meets Expectations\n\n\nThe salt production program proceeds as planned. By 1442, Giacomo Ferrante has completed the Trapani expansion, adding twenty thousand quintales to Sicily's annual output. The new pans gleam white under the Mediterranean sun, and Ferrante's workers—many recruited from the Sicilian interior with promises of steady wages—harvest salt with the efficiency of centuries of accumulated knowledge.\n\n\nIn Andalusia, Don Rodrigo de Ponce proves as capable as his pedigree suggested. The Cádiz works face the usual delays of new construction—a sea wall that must be rebuilt after winter storms, a dispute with local fishermen over water rights—but by mid-1443, the first large harvests are gathered. The salt is good, clean, white as snow.\n\n\nBy 1444, the Crown's salt production has increased by thirty-eight to forty thousand quintales annually. The costs remain within budget. Don Álvaro notes with satisfaction that the program is \"adequate to purpose.\"\n\n\n\nNow, for the African trade infrastructure:\n\n\nChaos Roll: African Trade Route Establishment (1439-1444)\n\n\nFive-year program to establish coastal outposts between the Canary Islands and the Senegal River, expand the trading post at São João da Ribeira, and procure/dedicate vessels for the salt-gold trade.\n\n\nFavorable factors:\n\n\nSão João da Ribeira already operational on Senegal River\n\nTreaty of Timbuktu (Roll 91) provides trading privileges and Malian cooperation\n\nAmbassador Musa Keita can facilitate relations with Mali\n\nCanary Islands provide established Castilian waypoint\n\nPortuguese alliance—Madeira available, Prince Henry's expertise accessible\n\nStrong treasury (over 1 million florins) for investment\n\nPortuguese caravel designs available for shipbuilding\n\nSuccessful expedition proves the route is viable\n\nSalt production program meeting targets (Roll 64)\n\n\nRisk factors:\n\n\nCoastline between Canaries and Senegal poorly mapped\n\nTropical diseases devastating to European sailors and garrison troops\n\nNeed to locate suitable harbors with fresh water sources\n\nLocal populations may be hostile to permanent settlements\n\nMarinid Sultan of Morocco may view expansion as threat\n\nPortuguese may be protective of their African interests despite alliance\n\nShipbuilding for caravels requires specialized skills Castile may lack\n\nRemote outposts difficult to supply and garrison\n\nSailors unfamiliar with African currents, winds, and hazards\n\nStorm damage, shipwrecks on unfamiliar coast\n\nFive to seven caravels needed—significant procurement challenge\n\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCatastrophic failure. Disease devastates the first garrison expedition—over half the men die within months. Two caravels lost to storms off the African coast. Attempted outpost abandoned. São João da Ribeira remains operational but isolated. By 1444, no new outposts established, only 2-3 serviceable caravels, trade route effectively non-functional. Significant loss of life and investment.\n6-12\nSevere difficulties. One outpost attempted, abandoned due to disease and local hostility. Ship procurement plagued by delays—Castilian yards struggle with caravel construction. Portuguese cooperation cooler than hoped. By 1444: São João da Ribeira maintained but not expanded, only 3-4 caravels operational, one intermediate outpost barely functional. Trade possible but unreliable—perhaps 2-3 successful voyages per year.\n13-25\nBelow expectations. Disease claims many garrison troops; one of two planned intermediate outposts fails. Shipbuilding slower than projected. Portuguese provide limited assistance. By 1444: São João da Ribeira expanded modestly, one intermediate outpost (likely Cape Bojador or Arguin area) operational, 4-5 caravels dedicated to the route. Trade functioning but below capacity—5-8 voyages per year achievable.\n26-45\nAdequate progress. Challenges overcome through persistence. Disease losses serious but manageable with rotation of garrison troops. One intermediate outpost established successfully; second planned but not yet complete. By 1444: São João da Ribeira significantly expanded, one reliable waypoint outpost, 5-6 caravels operational. Trade route functional—8-12 voyages per year. Relations with local populations mixed but workable.\n46-65\nMeets expectations. Program proceeds roughly as planned. Portuguese cooperation solid; Prince Henry provides pilots and advice. Two intermediate outposts established (likely Arguin Island and one other). Shipbuilding succeeds—combination of Portuguese-built and Castilian-built caravels. By 1444: robust trading infrastructure, 6-7 caravels dedicated to African trade, 12-15 voyages per year achievable. São João da Ribeira thriving. Disease managed through seasonal rotations.\n66-80\nExceeds expectations. Favorable conditions, strong Portuguese partnership, skilled management. Two intermediate outposts well-established with reliable water sources. Local populations largely cooperative—trade agreements signed. Shipbuilding efficient; 7-8 caravels operational by 1444. Trade route reliable—15-18 voyages per year. Garrison losses to disease lower than feared due to careful site selection and rotation policies.\n81-92\nRemarkable success. Exceptional cooperation with Portugal; Prince Henry personally invests advisors and pilots. Three intermediate outposts established, including one previously unknown excellent harbor. Local rulers actively seek trade relationships. By 1444: 8-9 caravels operational, infrastructure exceeds requirements, 18-22 voyages per year achievable. São João da Ribeira becomes a true trading town. Malian merchants begin traveling to meet Castilian ships.\n93-100\nExtraordinary achievement. Everything aligns perfectly. Portuguese-Castilian cooperation becomes model of allied enterprise. Discovery of exceptional harbor sites with fresh water and defensive positions. Local populations welcome trade; multiple chieftains sign agreements. Disease impact minimal due to fortunate circumstances. By 1444: 10+ caravels operational, four outposts creating reliable chain from Canaries to Senegal, 22-25+ voyages per year. The African trade route becomes the envy of Europe. Genoese and Venetian merchants inquire about participation.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

      "say": "Thought process: Calibrated gold trade projections accounting for infrastructure constraints and diplomatic advantages.\n\nThe user wants me to draft a d100 table for the actual gold trade over the five years (1439-1444), taking into account the results of the previous rolls:\n\n1. Salt production expansion: Roll 64 - Meets expectations (38,000-40,000 additional quintales by 1444)\n2. African trade route establishment: Roll 27 - Below expectations (São João da Ribeira expanded modestly, one intermediate outpost operational, 4-5 caravels, 5-8 voyages per year achievable)\n\nSo the infrastructure is somewhat limited - they have fewer ships and outposts than hoped. This should affect the gold trade potential.\n\nKey factors:\n- The Treaty of Timbuktu (Roll 91) provides excellent trading privileges\n- Salt production is meeting targets (Roll 64)\n- But trade infrastructure is below expectations (Roll 27) - only 4-5 caravels, 5-8 voyages per year, one intermediate outpost\n- Crown is buying salt at fixed prices and trading directly for gold\n- Weapons and horses are gifts to build relations\n\nThe limiting factor here is the infrastructure - they can produce plenty of salt, but can only ship 5-8 voyages per year with 4-5 caravels. \n\nLet me think about realistic gold amounts:\n- Musa Keita mentioned that the northern caravans carry about 700,000 pounds of salt (~2,000 camel loads at ~350 lbs each)\n- Salt can trade weight for weight for gold in the interior\n- But that's at the gold fields - in Timbuktu, the exchange rate would be less favorable\n- The expedition brought back 600 pounds of gold (Roll 91 - exceptional)\n\nIf they can do 5-8 voyages per year, each caravel carrying maybe 100,000 pounds of salt (50-60 tons), that's 500,000-800,000 pounds of salt per year at maximum.\n\nBut wait - they're just starting in 1439 and building up. \n\nThe trade route will gradually ramp up, with initial years showing limited capacity. The first two years will be experimental, establishing connections and testing logistics. By 1441-1442, they'll start to hit a more consistent trading rhythm, though still constrained by their modest naval infrastructure. The peak trading potential won't be realized until the final years of this period, when they've refined their approach and built more relationships with local traders.\n\nGold exchanges in Timbuktu present a complex economic landscape. The city serves as a critical intermediary, which means trade rates are less favorable compared to direct exchanges at gold mining sites. Estimating conservatively, each voyage could generate substantial returns, with salt-to-gold conversion rates potentially ranging between 50:1 and 100:1 by weight. This suggests significant potential economic value, though the actual yields would depend on precise market conditions and trading relationships.\n\nProjected annual gold acquisition varies dramatically based on infrastructure and diplomatic conditions. Potential outcomes range from modest 100-pound yields in challenging scenarios to impressive 1,500-pound acquisitions under optimal circumstances. The key limiting factor appears to be shipping capacity rather than production capabilities or diplomatic access.\n\nRealistic annual projections break down into four potential scenarios:\n- Challenging years: 100-300 pounds\n- Average performance: 400-600 pounds\n- Strong years: 700-1,000 pounds\n- Exceptional periods: 1,000-1,500 pounds\n\nThese estimates align with current operational constraints and regional dynamics.\n\n\nResult: 27 — Below Expectations\n\n\nThe African trade route proves harder to establish than hoped. Disease claims nearly a third of the first garrison sent to establish an outpost at Arguin Island—the men sicken within weeks, their bodies unable to withstand fevers unknown in Castile. A second attempt at a site further south is abandoned when the local Wolof chieftains prove hostile, attacking the construction party and forcing a retreat to the ships.\n\n\nBy 1444, the infrastructure remains modest: São João da Ribeira has been expanded, with better warehouses and a small permanent garrison that has learned—painfully—how to survive the climate through careful rotation. One intermediate outpost at Arguin functions, though it is more a resupply point than a true trading station. The Castilian shipyards struggle with caravel construction; Portuguese assistance is helpful but limited, as Prince Henry guards his shipwrights' secrets. Four caravels and one aging fifth vessel serve the route, capable of perhaps five to eight voyages per year under good conditions.\n\n\nIt is enough to trade. It is not enough to dominate.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll: African Gold Trade Volume (1439-1444)\n\n\nFive-year development of direct Crown salt-for-gold trade with Mali via the Senegal River route.\n\n\nFixed factors from previous rolls:\n\n\nTreaty of Timbuktu (Roll 91): Exceptional—Malian cooperation is excellent, trading privileges secured, Christian quarter permitted\n\nSalt production (Roll 64): Meets expectations—38,000-40,000 additional quintales available by 1444\n\nTrade infrastructure (Roll 27): Below expectations—4-5 caravels, 5-8 voyages/year maximum, limited outpost network\n\n\nAdditional favorable factors:\n\n\nAmbassador Musa Keita facilitating relations\n\nGifts of weapons and horses building goodwill with Mansa\n\nNo intermediate traders taking margins—direct Crown trade\n\nSalt quality from Trapani and Cádiz is excellent\n\nMalian merchants eager for reliable alternative to desert caravans\n\n\nAdditional risk factors:\n\n\nExchange rates fluctuate based on local conditions\n\nDrought years in the Sahel reduce gold production at source\n\nCompetition from established Maghrebi traders who may undercut prices\n\nShipping losses (storms, accidents) reduce actual delivered cargo\n\nDistance from Senegal River to Timbuktu means Crown trades with intermediaries, not directly at source\n\nMalian political instability could disrupt trade\n\nLearning curve—early years will be less efficient than later years\n\n\nTrade mechanics:\n\n\nCrown purchases salt at fixed prices from Trapani/Cádiz operations\n\nSalt shipped to São João da Ribeira on Senegal River\n\nTraded to Malian merchants (and through them to interior markets) for gold\n\nGold shipped back to Seville\n\nInfrastructure limits throughput regardless of salt availability\n\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nTrade collapse. Drought devastates the gold-producing regions; Malian civil strife disrupts caravans from the interior. Multiple ship losses. By 1444, total gold reaching Seville over five years: ~800-1,000 lbs. Annual rate by 1444: barely 100-150 lbs/year. The venture operates at a loss.\n6-12\nSevere underperformance. Malian intermediaries prove difficult—demand better terms, delay deliveries. Exchange rates far worse than hoped. Ship losses and disease disrupt regular voyages. By 1444, total gold: ~1,500-2,000 lbs over five years. Annual rate by 1444: 200-300 lbs/year. Costs barely covered.\n13-25\nBelow expectations. Trade functions but inefficiently. Early voyages plagued by inexperience; exchange rates fluctuate unpredictably. Infrastructure limitations bite hard—salt sits in warehouses waiting for ships. By 1444, total gold: ~2,500-3,500 lbs over five years. Annual rate by 1444: 400-500 lbs/year. Modest profit, disappointing returns on investment.\n26-45\nAdequate development. Trade establishes itself slowly but steadily. Year 1-2 yields minimal; Years 3-5 improve as relationships mature and procedures are refined. Exchange rates stabilize at reasonable levels. By 1444, total gold: ~4,000-5,000 lbs over five years. Annual rate by 1444: 600-800 lbs/year. Solid profit; venture proves viable.\n46-65\nMeets potential given infrastructure. Despite limited ships and outposts, Crown maximizes available capacity. Malian cooperation (per Treaty) proves valuable—preferential treatment for Castilian traders. By 1444, total gold: ~5,500-7,000 lbs over five years. Annual rate by 1444: 900-1,100 lbs/year. Good returns; clear proof of concept for future expansion.\n66-80\nExceeds expectations. Skilled management overcomes infrastructure limitations. Malian merchants actively seek out Castilian salt, offering favorable rates. Some gold brought directly to São João da Ribeira by Malian traders, reducing need for voyages upriver. By 1444, total gold: ~7,500-9,000 lbs over five years. Annual rate by 1444: 1,200-1,500 lbs/year. Excellent returns; treasury benefits significantly.\n81-92\nRemarkable success. Everything that can go right does. Mansa Mahmud II personally directs preferential treatment for Castilian traders as reward for weapons and horses. Malian merchant families establish permanent presence at São João da Ribeira, bringing gold to meet ships. Exchange rates exceptionally favorable. By 1444, total gold: ~10,000-12,000 lbs over five years. Annual rate by 1444: 1,800-2,200 lbs/year. The limited infrastructure strains to handle the volume.\n93-100\nExtraordinary windfall. Combination of exceptional Malian relations, fortunate timing (abundant gold production years), and creative solutions to infrastructure limits. Malian caravans begin meeting Castilian ships at the coast, eliminating river navigation delays. Mansa sends additional gold as diplomatic gifts. By 1444, total gold: ~13,000-16,000 lbs over five years. Annual rate by 1444: 2,500-3,000 lbs/year. Crown becomes significant player in European gold markets despite modest infrastructure.\n\n\nContext for gold amounts:\n\n\n600 lbs of gold was the exceptional (Roll 91) haul from the original expedition\n\n1 lb of gold ≈ 15-18 florins at 1440s rates\n\n1,000 lbs gold/year ≈ 15,000-18,000 florins annual revenue\n\nFor comparison: Castile's total annual revenue is ~380,000 florins\n\nThe desert caravans historically moved far more gold, but through many hands over centuries of established trade\n\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

Five years of work, distilled into parchment and figures.\n\n\n\"The venture is viable, Your Majesty,\" he says, settling into his chair. \"Not the triumph we hoped for—the infrastructure difficulties saw to that. But viable nonetheless. A thousand pounds of gold flowing into Toledo each year, and the Malians eager for more of our salt than we can presently deliver.\"\n\n\nHe taps the document. \"The investment will pay for itself within the decade. And that assumes we make no improvements. Add more ships, establish better outposts, train our own pilots instead of borrowing Portuguese ones...\" He spreads his hands. \"The potential is there. We have proven the route works. Now we must decide whether to expand it.\"\n\n\nThrough the window, Toledo gleams in the spring sunlight. Somewhere in the city, the Royal Mint is striking doblas from African gold—gold that traveled by camel and canoe and caravel from mines no Christian had seen a decade ago.\n\n\nThe Marinid Sultan has noticed. Merchants in Tunis and Cairo have noticed. The Venetians and Genoese, those eternal traders, have begun making inquiries about participation in this new Atlantic commerce.\n\n\nAnd in Timbuktu, Mansa Mahmud II receives reports from Ambassador Musa Keita about the strange Christian king who speaks Arabic, who sends horses and steel as gifts, who seems genuinely interested in books as well as gold.\n\n\nThe world is shifting. Slowly, almost imperceptibly—but shifting nonetheless.\n\n\n\nThe document summarizes all investments, ship requirements, trade volumes, and minting operations for the African Trade Enterprise from 1439-1444.\n\nFile: /mnt/user-data/outputs/African_Trade_Enterprise_1439-1444.docx"

What percentage of annual African gold production does 1,000 lbs represent?\n\nLet me answer these:\n\n**1. What is a pound (lb)?**\nA pound (abbreviated \"lb\" from the Latin \"libra\") is a unit of mass. In medieval Europe, there were various pound standards, but for our purposes:\n- 1 pound (lb) ≈ 453.6 grams (modern avoirdupois pound)\n- Medieval pounds varied slightly by region, but were generally similar\n\nSo 1,000 lbs = approximately 453.6 kg or about half a metric ton.\n\n**2. Percentage of African gold production**\n\nFrom the search results, I found some useful data:\n- The Metropolitan Museum notes that Mansa Musa carried \"a ton of the metal\" (1324-25) which crashed the gold market in Cairo, suggesting the average annual supply was \"not as great\"\n- One source mentions that by the 1480s, the Volta River gold mines alone supplied \"an estimated one tonne of gold per year\" to Portuguese merchants\n- At its height, Mali supplied \"nearly two-thirds of Europe's gold\"\n- In the 15th century, West Africa was producing \"10% of the world's gold\"\n\nThe trans-Saharan trade historically moved several tons of gold northward annually. Estimates vary, but the annual flow of gold across the Sahara during the height of the Mali Empire was probably in the range of 3-10 tons (6,600-22,000 lbs) per year.\n\nIf we estimate the trans-Saharan gold trade at around 5-8 tons annually (a reasonable middle estimate for the 15th century when Mali was past its peak but still significant), that would be:\n- 5 tons = 11,000 lbs\n- 8 tons = 17,600 lbs\n\n\n- 1,000 lbs represents a modest but noteworthy portion of the annual gold trade\n- At 5 tons per year, 1,000 lbs accounts for about 9% of the trans-Saharan flow\n- At 8 tons per year, it represents approximately 5.7% of the annual gold movement\n\nThis quantity signifies a meaningful contribution to the regional trade, indicating economic potential without overwhelming existing market dynamics.\n\n\nGood questions. Let me clarify:\n\n\nWhat is \"lbs\"?\n\n\n\"Lbs\" is the abbreviation for pounds (from Latin libra). One pound equals approximately 453 grams, so:\n\n\n1,000 lbs = 453 kg = roughly half a metric ton of gold\n\n\nIn medieval terms, this would be about 32,000 gold doblas or 16,000 florins worth.\n\n\nPercentage of African gold production\n\n\nBased on the research, the trans-Saharan gold trade moved substantial quantities northward annually. By the 1480s, the forest gold mines along the Volta River alone supplied an estimated one tonne of gold per year to Portuguese merchants. Mansa Musa's arrival in Cairo carrying a ton of the metal (1324–25) caused the market in gold to crash, suggesting that the average annual supply was not as great.\n\n\nHistorians estimate the trans-Saharan caravans moved somewhere between 3-8 tons of gold annually during this period (the 1430s-1440s being somewhat past Mali's peak). At the middle estimate of 5-6 tons annually crossing the desert:\n\n\n1,000 lbs (your 1444 imports) = roughly 6-9% of the trans-Saharan flow\n\n\nThis is a meaningful foothold—enough to prove the maritime route works and to worry the Maghrebi merchants—but not yet enough to seriously disrupt the ancient caravan trade. To truly challenge Taghaza and the desert routes, you would need to scale up significantly, perhaps to 3,000-5,000 lbs annually.\n\n\nThe infrastructure limitations (only 4-5 caravels, one intermediate outpost) are the bottleneck, not salt supply or Malian willingness to trade."

Based on the chaos roll result (27 - Below Expectations), I described that one intermediate outpost at Arguin was established, while a second coastal site was abandoned due to local hostility and disease.\n\nArguin Island is a real historical location - it's an island off the coast of Mauritania, which the Portuguese historically did use as a trading post starting in the 1440s. It makes sense in this context.\n\nLet me explain where Arguin is located.\n\n\nBased on the document, the intermediate outpost is at Arguin Island—a small island off the coast of what is now Mauritania, roughly halfway between the Canary Islands and the Senegal River.\n\n\nHistorically, this is exactly where the Portuguese established their first permanent trading post on the African coast in 1445. The island has several advantages:\n\n\nDefensible: Being an island, it's protected from overland attack by hostile local populations\n\nFresh water: Unlike much of the desert coast, it has accessible water sources\n\nAnchorage: Suitable harbor for caravels\n\nStrategic position: About 800 km south of the Canaries, roughly midway to the Senegal\n\n\nThe route as it stands in 1444:\n\n\nCádiz/Sanlúcar → (10 days sail) → Canary Islands (Castilian, fully operational)\n\nCanary Islands → (7-10 days sail) → Arguin Island (limited outpost, resupply only)\n\nArguin Island → (5-7 days sail) → São João da Ribeira on the Senegal River (primary trading post, Portuguese-founded but jointly operated)\n\n\nThe second coastal outpost—the one that was abandoned after the garrison was attacked by Wolof warriors and ravaged by fever—was likely attempted somewhere along the coast between Arguin and the Senegal, perhaps near Cape Verde or the Gambia River mouth. That failure is part of why the infrastructure roll came in below expectations."

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed African trade's modest returns against superior domestic silver yields.\n\nThe user is making an important strategic observation. Let me think about this:\n\n1. The African gold trade at current levels (1,000 lbs/year = ~16,000 florins) is modest\n2. Even at 10x scale (10,000 lbs/year = ~160,000 florins), capturing 70% of Mali's gold export, it's still relatively modest compared to other revenue sources\n3. The user's silver mine in Granada is producing more value\n\nLet me recall the silver mine details from earlier chapters. From the project files, the Granada silver mining operation was established and there was a second refinery planned. The silver mines were yielding significant revenue - I believe around 50,000-100,000 florins annually, possibly more by 1444 with the expansion.\n\nThe user is making a shrewd economic calculation here - the African trade is strategically interesting and has long-term potential, but in pure financial terms, domestic silver mining is more profitable and less risky than trying to establish outposts along a disease-ridden, hostile African coast.\n\nThis is a realistic medieval ruler's assessment. The African trade is:\n- High risk (disease, hostile locals, shipwrecks, long supply lines)\n- Capital intensive (ships, outposts, garrisons)\n- Currently yielding modest returns\n- Limited by infrastructure that is very hard to build\n\nMeanwhile silver mining in Granada:\n- Under direct Crown control in pacified territory\n- Uses established technology and labor\n- Lower risk\n- Already producing significant returns\n\nThe user seems to be questioning whether the African venture is worth the effort compared to focusing on domestic resource extraction. This is a perfectly valid strategic consideration.\n\nI should acknowledge this economic reality while perhaps noting the strategic/non-financial benefits of the African trade (diversification, prestige, weakening Moroccan rivals, future potential if infrastructure improves, etc.). But I shouldn't try to \"sell\" the African trade if the economics don't make sense - that would be the AI helpfulness bias the system prompt warns against.\n\nLet me respond as Álvaro would - acknowledging the cold economic reality while noting any strategic considerations.\n\n\nDon Álvaro nods slowly, his expression thoughtful. You have put your finger on the uncomfortable truth.\n\n\n\"You are correct, Your Majesty. The numbers do not lie.\"\n\n\nHe pulls the report back toward him, running a finger down the figures. \"Your silver mines at Granada—with the second refinery now operational—yield what, sixty thousand florins annually? Seventy? And that will only grow as we expand the works. All of it extracted from land you control absolutely, processed by workers who live under your laws, transported on roads you patrol.\"\n\n\nHe sets down the document. \"The African trade is... romantic. A Christian king reaching across the sea to trade with the lords of Timbuktu. The stuff of chronicles and legends. But as an investment?\" He shrugs. \"Even if we somehow captured the entire Malian gold export—every grain that would otherwise cross the Sahara—we speak of perhaps eight or nine tons annually. Three hundred thousand florins at most. And we will never capture all of it. The desert routes are ancient, established, trusted. We offer an alternative, not a replacement.\"\n\n\nHe leans back. \"The African coast is a graveyard for European men. Fevers we cannot cure, peoples who see us as invaders, distances that strain our ability to supply and reinforce. Every florin of gold we bring back costs us in ships, in sailors, in soldiers who die sweating in foreign stockades.\"\n\n\nA pause. \"The silver is here. Under your feet. In mountains you conquered. Guarded by castles you built.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes directly. \"The African venture has value, Your Majesty. It denies gold to the Marinids. It builds relationships that may prove useful. It trains sailors and mapmakers for... whatever comes next.\" A slight gesture westward, toward the Atlantic. \"But if you ask me whether the Crown's treasury is better served by fifty thousand florins invested in African outposts or fifty thousand florins invested in a third silver refinery...\"\n\n\nHe does not finish the sentence. He does not need to."

I should not assume what the idea is or have Juan speak.\n\nLet me set the scene appropriately. It's Spring 1444, Toledo. Lucia would be somewhere in the royal apartments or perhaps in the gardens given the spring weather.

An idea, still half-shaped.\n\n\nYou find Lucia in the small garden courtyard off the royal apartments, the one she has made her own over the years. Orange trees line the walls, their blossoms scenting the spring air. She sits on a stone bench with young Nicolás—six years old now, all energy and questions—while Teresa and Juana chase each other around the fountain, their laughter bright against the splash of water.\n\n\nLucia looks up as you enter.

So we're now in Spring 1444.\n\nBut the user corrected me saying \"I have been married to Lucia for 5 years\" - so if we're in 1444, that would mean they married around 1439. But that contradicts earlier campaign information...\n\nLet me check the Royal Children Database reference mentioned in the transcript. The user says Nicolas is \"only 2 at most\" and Lucia is \"around 27.\"\n\nIf Nicolas is 2 and we're in 1444, he was born around 1442.\n\nActually, I think the user is correcting me to keep things consistent. Let me work with what the user has stated:\n- Nicolas is 2 (at most)\n- Lucia is around 27\n- Married for 5 years\n\nSo in Spring 1444:\n\n\n- Lucia is 27, married at 22 in 1439\n- Their children would be relatively young\n\nI see Lucia has four children: Bianca, Teresa, Juana, and Nicolás. With Nicolas being 2 years old, and assuming typical spacing between births, I can estimate the ages of her other children. If children are spaced about 1.5-2 years apart, Bianca might be around 4, Teresa around 3, and Juana around 5.\n\nConsidering they've been married since early 1439, the birth timeline makes sense. Bianca likely born late 1439 or early 1440, Teresa in 1441, Juana in 1442, and Nicolás in 1442/1443. While having four children in five years seems rapid, it's not unusual for noble families of this era to have closely spaced births.\n\nFrom Juan's previous marriage to Isabel, Fernando and Catalina are older - Fernando around 13 and Catalina 11-12 in 1444. The description of young children playing and Nicolás being carried aligns with this family dynamic.\n\nThe potential Medici banking partnership represents a significant strategic move. At this point, Cosimo de' Medici leads a powerful financial network with extensive papal and European connections. Integrating this Castilian imperial banking system could yield substantial political and economic advantages.\n\nMedieval royal child-rearing practices involved specialized education across different courts, with distinct training for boys and girls. Boys learned martial skills, while girls focused on household management and courtly arts.\n\nJuan appears to be contemplating an unconventional approach, desiring to keep his children close and provide direct exposure to imperial operations.\n\n\nLucia's expression sharpens with interest at the mention of the Medici. The d'Este and the Medici have long been rivals for influence in Italy, but she is pragmatic enough to recognize their utility.\n\n\n\"Cosimo de' Medici is the cleverest banker in Christendom,\" she says, settling onto the stone bench and patting the space beside her. \"His bank already serves the Papacy, the wool trade in Flanders, half the princes of Italy. If you bring him into your empire's finances...\" She pauses, considering. \"He would gain access to your silver, your African gold, your trade routes. You would gain a network of agents and letters of credit stretching from London to Constantinople.\"\n\n\nShe watches Juana and Teresa—three and four years old, all giggles and skinned knees—while Bianca, the eldest at five, tries to maintain dignity by the orange trees. Little Nicolás has found a stick and is hitting the ground with great concentration.\n\n\n\"But the Medici are not servants. They are partners. And partners have their own interests.\" A slight smile. \"My father always said: when you invite a banker to your table, count the silver before and after.\"\n\n\n\nAt your question about the children, her expression softens. She reaches out and takes your hand.\n\n\n\"They are so young still. Nicolás barely speaks in sentences. Even Bianca...\" She shakes her head. \"But yes. I think about this too. Fernando and Catalina—\" Isabel's children, nearly grown now, \"—they remember the war, the conquest. They saw Granada fall. Our little ones know only peace, only Toledo, only this.\" She gestures at the sheltered garden.\n\n\n\"Travel would teach them much. The sea, the mountains, the different peoples of your realms. Sicily, perhaps, when they are older. Or Constantinople—to see the empire they may one day inherit or marry into.\"\n\n\nShe squeezes your hand. \"What experiences did you have, Juan, that made you who you are? What do you wish you had learned younger?\""

Let me first check the Royal Children Database to get accurate information about all the children and their ages.\n\nFrom the transcript summary, we have:\n- Catalina (Isabel's daughter)\n- Fernando (Isabel's son)\n- Bianca (Lucia's daughter, 5 years old)\n- Teresa (Lucia's daughter, 3-4 years old)\n- Juana (Lucia's daughter, 3 years old)\n- Nicolás (Lucia's son, 2 years old at most)\n\nLet me search for more details about the children's ages and status.\n\nActually, we're in 1439 now based on the chapter. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nFrom the transcript:\n- The current date mentioned at the start is February 1439\n- But then we did a 5-year roll for salt production and trade (1439-1444)\n- So we're now in Spring 1444\n\nLet me check the Royal Children Database for accurate ages.\n\nFrom the memory and context:\n- Juan married Isabel of Portugal first, she died\n- Fernando and Catalina are Isabel's children\n- Juan then married Lucia d'Este\n- Lucia's children: Bianca, Teresa, Juana, Nicolás\n\nThe user mentioned:\n- \"I took Catalina to see Constantinople when she was 2\"\n- Nicolás is \"2 at most\"\n- Lucia is \"around 27\"\n- They've been married \"5 years\"\n\nWait, but we just did a 5-year time skip to 1444. So I need to recalculate.\n\nIf in February 1439:\n- Nicolás was maybe 1-2\n- Bianca was 5\n- Teresa was 3-4\n- Juana was 3\n\nThen in Spring 1444 (5 years later):\n- Nicolás would be 6-7\n\n\n- Bianca would be 10\n- Teresa would be 8-9\n- Juana would be 8\n\nI realize the document is a projected report \"as if\" it's 1444, but we're actually still in 1439. The time skip was just for financial planning, not the narrative timeline. This means the children's ages need to be recalculated based on the actual current year.\n\nThe children's current ages in 1439 are:\n- Bianca: around 4-5 years old\n- Teresa: around 3 years old\n- Juana: around 2-3 years old\n- Nicolás: 2 at most\n\nI need to investigate Catalina's age, tracing back to Juan's marriage to Isabel of Portugal. The game's context started in 1430, with the Reconquista completed in 1433, and Isabel passing away at some point during this period.\n\nCatalina was 2 when Juan took her to Constantinople in 1434, which means she was born around 1432. By 1439, she would be approximately 7 years old. Fernando, mentioned as an heir, is likely of similar age or slightly older.\n\nI'm considering creating an educational assessment for Catalina, focusing on her progress in music, song, languages, and her father's exploration of her potential interest in math, geography, and history.\n\n\nLucia smiles at the memory. \"Catalina on that ship to Constantinople... she was so small, and so serious. Watching everything with those big eyes.\"\n\n\nShe glances toward the children playing. \"Bianca is beginning her letters now. The others are still too young for formal instruction. But Catalina and Fernando—yes, they are of an age where we can see what they are becoming.\"\n\n\n\nChaos Roll: Catalina's Educational Progress (1439)\n\n\nPrincess Catalina, approximately 7 years old, daughter of the late Queen Isabel. Currently receiving instruction in music, singing, languages, arithmetic, geography, history, and courtly skills befitting a princess who may one day marry into a major European dynasty.\n\n\nFavorable factors:\n\n\nIntelligent parents (Juan is notably learned; Isabel was educated)\n\nAccess to the finest tutors in Castile\n\nFather personally involved in her education\n\nEarly exposure to travel and foreign cultures (Constantinople at age 2)\n\nMultilingual household environment\n\nStable, secure childhood despite mother's death\n\n\nRisk factors:\n\n\nLost her mother young (potential emotional impact)\n\nFather frequently occupied with affairs of state\n\nBeing a girl limits certain educational opportunities by convention\n\nMay be pressured toward \"feminine\" accomplishments over intellectual pursuits\n\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nStruggling. Catalina is a sweet child but shows little aptitude or interest in formal learning. She dutifully attends lessons but retains little. Music brings her some joy, but academics frustrate her. Tutors report she daydreams frequently and seems melancholic—perhaps still affected by her mother's absence. She may flourish in other ways, but scholarship is not her gift.\n6-15\nAdequate but unremarkable. Catalina meets expectations for a princess but does not exceed them. She reads and writes competently, sings pleasantly, and has memorized the geography and genealogies expected of her. No particular passion has emerged. She applies herself when supervised but shows little self-motivation. A conventional princess in the making.\n16-35\nSolid progress. Catalina is developing well. She reads fluently in Castilian and is progressing in Latin. Her singing voice is pretty, and she shows genuine enjoyment of music. She has a good memory for history and genealogy—useful for a future queen. Mathematics and geography interest her less, but she applies herself dutifully. Languages come reasonably well; her Portuguese (her mother's tongue) is good, and she is beginning Italian.\n36-55\nAbove expectations. Catalina shows real intelligence and curiosity. She asks questions that surprise her tutors—about why kingdoms have the borders they do, about how her father's ships reach Africa. Her Greek is coming along well (Juan's personal instruction), and she has shown unexpected interest in maps and charts. Music remains a strength; she plays the lute with feeling. She remembers her mother with sadness but has channeled it into determination.\n56-75\nImpressive development. Catalina is emerging as genuinely gifted. She reads Latin fluently and has begun composing simple verses. Her ear for languages is exceptional—she switches between Castilian, Portuguese, and Italian with ease, and her Greek pronunciation pleases her father. She has discovered a love of history, particularly stories of great queens. Geography fascinates her; she can name every major port in the Mediterranean and trace trade routes on a map. Her tutors speak of her with genuine admiration.\n76-90\nExceptional. Catalina displays the kind of intellect that makes tutors request additional hours. She devours books, asks penetrating questions about statecraft and religion, and has begun reading chronicles in their original languages. Mathematics has clicked for her—she understands why merchants need arithmetic and has started asking about accounting. Her music is beautiful, but it is her mind that truly shines. She speaks of wanting to \"understand everything\" about her father's empire. She carries herself with quiet dignity beyond her years.\n91-100\nRemarkable prodigy. At seven, Catalina already shows signs of extraordinary capability. She reads in five languages, debates theology with churchmen who visit the court, and has memorized the major treaties and alliances of Christendom. Her tutors report that she corrects their errors. She has requested lessons in Arabic—\"because Father speaks it, and the Moors did too.\" She approaches learning with fierce intensity, as if trying to live up to something—or someone. The court whispers that she has her father's mind and her mother's grace. Future ambassadors will find her formidable.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Catalina."

He would be around 15 years old in 1439 (born around 1424 based on the campaign timeline).\n\n\nLucia listens as you speak of your own childhood—the sheltering, the protection that sometimes felt like a cage. She nods slowly.\n\n\n\"Then we shall give them the world,\" she says simply. \"Not all at once. But piece by piece.\"\n\n\n\nResult: 56 — Impressive Development\n\n\nCatalina is emerging as genuinely gifted. At seven, she reads Latin fluently and has begun composing simple verses—clumsy still, but showing real feeling. Her ear for languages is exceptional; she switches between Castilian, Portuguese, and Italian with an ease that delights the court, and her Greek pronunciation—fruit of your personal instruction—is coming along remarkably well.\n\n\n\"She asked me yesterday,\" Lucia says, a note of pride in her voice, \"why the maps show Constantinople so far from Toledo, but the ships can reach it in weeks. She wanted to understand the difference between land distance and sea distance.\"\n\n\nGeography has captured Catalina's imagination. She can name every major port in the Mediterranean, trace the route your ships take to Africa, and has begun asking questions about the lands beyond—what lies south of Mali, what lies east of Constantinople. Her tutors report that she studies maps the way other girls her age study embroidery patterns.\n\n\nHistory fascinates her too, particularly stories of great queens—Blanche of Castile, Eleanor of Aquitaine, the Byzantine empresses. She asks about her own mother sometimes, quietly, and the servants say she keeps a small portrait of Isabel in her chamber.\n\n\nHer music remains a strength. She plays the lute with genuine feeling, and her singing voice is clear and sweet.\n\n\n\"She is becoming someone,\" Lucia says softly. \"Not just a princess to be married off.

Fernando struggles with the weight of expectation. He is sullen in lessons, resistant to instruction, and prone to outbursts of temper. His tutors report difficulty focusing. He shows little interest in books and only middling aptitude for arms. There are whispers that he resents his position—or perhaps resents Juan. The boy needs careful handling, or these seeds may grow into something dangerous.\n6-15\nAdequate but concerning. Fernando meets minimum expectations but no more. He can read and write, ride passably, and recite his catechism. But there is a listlessness about him, a lack of fire. He does what is required and nothing beyond. His relationship with Juan is respectful but distant. Tutors worry he lacks the drive a future king will need.\n16-35\nSteady progress. Fernando is developing as expected for a prince his age. His Latin is serviceable, his horsemanship improving, his understanding of theology sound. He takes his duties seriously, if without enthusiasm. He has begun training with wooden swords and shows decent coordination. He speaks of his mother rarely but keeps her memory close. A solid foundation, though inspiration is lacking.\n36-55\nGood development. Fernando shows genuine capability. He rides well for his age, applies himself to his studies with discipline, and has begun to understand the basics of law and governance. He asks thoughtful questions about the conquest of Granada—he remembers fragments of it, wants to understand more. His relationship with Juan is warm; he clearly looks up to his stepfather. He is becoming a proper prince.\n56-75\nAbove expectations. Fernando is thriving. He excels at horsemanship and has shown real aptitude for martial training—his arms instructor speaks highly of his coordination and courage. His Latin is strong, and he has begun studying the chronicles of Castile's kings with genuine interest. He speaks of wanting to be \"worthy\" of his inheritance. He treats his half-siblings with affection and seems secure in his place. A promising heir.\n76-90\nImpressive. Fernando displays the makings of a fine king. He is bold in the training yard, thoughtful in the schoolroom, and carries himself with natural dignity. He has begun asking Juan questions about statecraft—about the Council, about taxation, about why certain decisions were made. He understands that kingship is more than battles and glory. He honors his mother's memory while embracing Juan as his father in truth. Courtiers speak well of him.\n91-100\nExceptional heir. At nine, Fernando already shows the qualities that make great kings. He leads the other boys in training, not through bullying but through example. His mind is sharp—he grasps complex political situations when they are explained to him. He has asked to attend Council sessions \"to learn.\" He speaks of the empire Juan is building with pride and ambition: \"I want to make it greater.\" His bond with Juan is deep and genuine. Castile's future looks bright indeed.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Fernando."

Fernando is Juan's biological son with Isabel (first wife)\n2. Fernando was not born yet when Granada fell (Granada fell in 1433, so Fernando must have been born after)\n3. Fernando has shown aptitude for horseriding\n4. Juan sometimes involves him in matters of statecraft\n\nLet me recalculate Fernando's age. If we're in 1439 and Fernando was born after 1433... Isabel died in childbirth with Fernando if I recall correctly from the campaign. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nActually, I should check the character database or summaries. But based on what the user is saying:\n- Fernando is Juan's biological son with Isabel\n- He was born after Granada fell (1433)\n- So in 1439, he would be at most 5-6 years old, not 9\n\nWait, but the user mentioned earlier that Fernando and Catalina are \"Isabel's children, nearly grown now\" - but that was my error that the user is now correcting.\n\nLet me reconsider. The user says:\n- Fernando was not born yet when Granada fell (1433)\n- So Fernando is at most 6 years old in 1439\n\nActually, I need to be more careful here. Let me re-read what the user said about the children earlier in this conversation:\n\n\"Bianca is beginning her letters now. The others are still too young for formal instruction. But Catalina and Fernando—yes, they are of an age where we can see what they are becoming.\"\n\nSo Catalina and Fernando are old enough for formal education. And earlier in the transcript summary it mentions:\n\"Six living children remain: Catalina, Fernando (Isabel's children); Bianca, Teresa, Juana, Nicolás (Lucia's children).\"\n\nSo Catalina and Fernando are Isabel's children. Isabel died... I need to check when. The user married Lucia around 1434-1435, so Isabel must have died before that.\n \nI'm puzzled by the discrepancy between Fernando's apparent age and his reported activities. His involvement in statecraft and horseriding seems advanced for a 5-6 year old. Perhaps my understanding of his birth year needs further investigation. The timeline doesn't quite align with the descriptions of his capabilities.\n\nThe marriage details and Isabel's death provide additional context. If they married in 1434 and Isabel died around that time, Fernando's birth could be more nuanced than initially calculated. His early exposure to statecraft suggests he might be slightly older or exceptionally precocious.\n\nI'll need to carefully reconcile the ages of Catalina and Fernando, considering the specific historical events and personal details provided. The chronology requires a more precise examination to understand their developmental context.\n\nThe table needs adjustment to reflect Fernando's young age, biological relationship, and emerging interests. His potential in horsemanship and statecraft, even at 5-6, indicates an early cultivation of noble skills typical for royal heirs.\n\n\nYou're right, I apologize for the errors. Let me correct:\n\n\nFernando is your biological son with Isabel, born after the fall of Granada in 1433. In 1439, he would be approximately 5-6 years old—still young, but old enough to begin showing his nature. You've already noticed his aptitude for horseriding and have begun involving him in small ways in statecraft.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll: Fernando's Early Development (1439)\n\n\nPrince Fernando, approximately 5-6 years old, firstborn son of Juan II and the late Queen Isabel. Heir apparent to Castile. Beginning formal instruction in riding, letters, and deportment. Father has noted early aptitude for horses and has begun exposing him to matters of governance.\n\n\nFavorable factors:\n\n\nBiological son of the king—secure in his position\n\nFather personally involved in his upbringing\n\nAlready showing natural affinity for horsemanship\n\nEarly exposure to court and statecraft\n\nStrong, healthy child\n\nDevoted father determined to prepare him well\n\n\nRisk factors:\n\n\nLost his mother in infancy (never knew her)\n\nStill very young for formal education\n\nWeight of expectation as heir\n\nFather frequently occupied with ruling an empire\n\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nConcerning signs. Fernando is a difficult child—prone to tantrums, resistant to instruction, and seemingly uninterested in anything but play. Even his love of horses manifests as recklessness rather than skill. He shows little affection for his half-siblings and seems confused about his place. Tutors struggle to hold his attention. He is young yet, but these early signs worry the household.\n6-15\nSlow to settle. Fernando is energetic but unfocused. He loves the stables but resists sitting still for letters. He is affectionate with his father but throws fits when Juan is called away to duties. Normal for his age, perhaps, but his tutors see no particular spark yet. His horsemanship remains his brightest spot.\n16-35\nNormal development. Fernando is a healthy, active boy developing as expected. He has begun learning his letters with moderate success. His riding continues to impress—he sits a pony with remarkable confidence for his age. He asks simple questions about \"what Father does\" but loses interest quickly. A typical young prince, neither exceptional nor concerning.\n36-55\nGood progress. Fernando shows promise. His horsemanship is genuinely impressive—the stable master says he has never seen a boy his age with such natural balance and fearlessness. He is beginning to recognize letters and can write his own name. When Juan takes him to observe court proceedings, he sits quietly and watches with apparent interest, even if he understands little. He speaks of his mother sometimes, asking questions about her.\n56-75\nAbove expectations. Fernando is thriving. He rides like a boy twice his age and has begun asking for a \"real horse, not a pony.\" His letters are progressing well—he reads simple words and practices writing with determination. When Juan explains matters of state in simple terms, Fernando listens intently and remembers. He shows natural authority with other children, leading games without bullying. He treasures a small portrait of Isabel that Juan gave him.\n76-90\nImpressive early signs. Fernando displays qualities that make observers speak of his potential. His horsemanship is extraordinary—fluid and intuitive, as if he were born in the saddle. He grasps his lessons quickly and asks \"why\" constantly. When Juan brought him to observe a Council meeting, he sat still for over an hour, then asked afterward why the lords argued. He shows genuine affection for his half-siblings, particularly little Bianca. The court sees a future king taking shape.\n91-100\nRemarkable child. At five or six, Fernando already carries himself with an unconscious dignity that stops visitors short. His horsemanship is spoken of throughout Toledo—he controls his pony with legs and voice alone, rarely needing reins. He is learning to read faster than expected and insists on practicing daily. When Juan explains things to him—about ships, about taxes, about why kings must make hard choices—Fernando's questions reveal genuine comprehension. He tells servants that he will \"help Father rule\" when he is bigger. The bond between father and son is evident to all.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Fernando."

At five, Fernando rides like a boy twice his age. The stable master, old Gonzalo who has trained three generations of Trastámara princes, shakes his head in wonder. \"He doesn't think about it, Your Majesty. He just rides. The horse knows what he wants before he asks.\" Fernando has already begun demanding a \"real horse\"—he considers his pony beneath his dignity, and frankly, he may be right. His balance, his fearlessness, his intuitive connection with the animal—these are gifts that cannot be taught.\n\n\nHis letters are progressing well too. He writes his name with careful determination, tongue poking out in concentration, and has begun reading simple words. He practices without being told, which surprises his tutors. There is a seriousness to him that seems older than his years.\n\n\nBut it is when you bring him to observe the business of ruling that Fernando truly comes alive. He sits quietly—remarkable for a child his age—watching the lords debate, studying the petitioners who approach your throne. Afterward, he peppers you with questions. \"Why was that man angry?\" \"What did the paper say?\" \"Will the ships come back?\"\n\n\nHe remembers what you tell him. Weeks later, he will ask follow-up questions that show he has been thinking.\n\n\nHe keeps the small portrait of Isabel in his chamber, next to his bed.

Named for her grandmother Bianca Maria Visconti.\n\n\nFavorable factors:\n\n\nBoth parents intelligent and educated\n\nMother from the cultured d'Este court of Ferrara—personally involved in daughters' education\n\nAccess to excellent tutors\n\nStable, loving household with both parents present\n\nOlder half-sister Catalina as role model\n\nFather values education for daughters as well as sons\n\n\nRisk factors:\n\n\nStill very young for formal assessment\n\nAs a younger daughter (not heir), may receive less focused attention\n\nFather frequently occupied with empire\n\nMay feel overshadowed by impressive older half-siblings\n\nThree younger siblings compete for parental attention\n\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDifficult start. Bianca resists lessons and cries frequently. She seems anxious and clings to her mother, showing little interest in letters or music. She is jealous of attention given to her siblings and prone to sulking. Her tutors struggle to engage her. Perhaps she is simply not ready, or perhaps something deeper troubles her. Lucia worries.\n6-15\nSlow beginning. Bianca is a sweet child but easily distracted. She would rather play with her sisters than sit for lessons. Her letters confuse her, and she shows no particular affinity for music yet. She tries to please but lacks focus. Normal for her age, perhaps, but no early spark is evident. She adores her mother and follows Lucia everywhere.\n16-35\nTypical progress. Bianca is developing normally for a five-year-old princess. She recognizes most letters and can write a few. She enjoys singing, though her voice is unremarkable. She is cheerful and affectionate, beloved by the household servants. She looks up to Catalina with obvious admiration. A pleasant child finding her footing.\n36-55\nGood development. Bianca shows promise. She is learning her letters steadily and takes pride in her small accomplishments. She has her mother's ear for music—her singing is sweet, and she loves to dance. She asks questions about Ferrara, wanting to know about \"where Mama comes from.\" She plays well with her younger siblings, showing a nurturing nature. A bright, happy child.\n56-75\nAbove expectations. Bianca is flourishing. Her letters come easily to her, and she has begun sounding out simple words with delight. She shows genuine musical talent—Lucia notes she has inherited the d'Este gift for melody. She is curious about everything: flowers, animals, stars, stories. She has a gentle, diplomatic nature, often mediating squabbles between Teresa and Juana. Tutors speak of her warmly.\n76-90\nImpressive early signs. Bianca displays notable intelligence wrapped in a sweet disposition. She reads simple words already and asks for more books. Her voice is lovely for her age, and she picks up melodies after hearing them once. She has begun asking about art—the paintings, the tapestries, wanting to know who made them and how. The d'Este heritage runs strong. She remembers everything she is told and makes surprising connections between ideas.\n91-100\nRemarkable child. At five, Bianca already shows the refined sensibility of her mother's Italian lineage combined with sharp Trastámara intelligence. She reads ahead of her age, sings beautifully, and has asked for drawing lessons after watching a court artist work. She speaks to visitors with a poise that charms ambassadors. She seems to understand people intuitively—knowing when her mother is tired, when her father is troubled, when her siblings need comfort. Lucia sees much of herself in this daughter, and perhaps something more.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Bianca."

The parallel to the story is clear: Bianca feels like she doesn't belong somehow, or that she's competing for attention in a big family.\n\nBut wait - what would cause Bianca to feel this way? She hasn't lost anyone. She has both parents. Unless... there's something else going on. Perhaps she overheard something? Perhaps she feels different from her siblings?

He's not lecturing her, he's letting her discover the truth herself.\n\nWhat might a five-year-old say? She's been processing this whole conversation.

Juan took her riding, told her a story that mirrored her own feelings, validated her emotions, bought her silk to make gifts, and gave her a sense of purpose as a \"big sister\" to Teresa and Juana.\n\n\nFavorable factors:\n\n\nFather's direct intervention created breakthrough moment\n\nBianca opened up and expressed her feelings for the first time\n\nGiven concrete purpose: learning to sew, making gifts for family\n\nEncouraged to channel love toward younger sisters\n\nMarta the seamstress providing patient instruction\n\nParents now aware of her emotional needs\n\nFelt truly seen by her father\n\n\nRisk factors:\n\n\nDeep-seated feelings of inadequacy don't vanish overnight\n\nMay revert to old patterns under stress\n\nStill competing for attention with four siblings\n\nFather remains busy with affairs of state\n\nUnderlying anxious temperament remains\n\nHigh expectations for her sewing project could create pressure\n\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nRegression. The breakthrough fades. Bianca's gift for Lucia turns out poorly despite her efforts, and she is devastated. She withdraws again, perhaps worse than before—feeling she has now failed at the one thing that was supposed to be \"hers.\" The underlying anxiety proves deeper than a single conversation can heal. She needs more help than her parents alone can provide.\n6-15\nMinimal improvement. Bianca has good days and bad days. She remembers the ride with her father and it brings her comfort, but old patterns reassert themselves. She still struggles with lessons, still pinches Teresa when frustrated, still clings to Lucia. The sewing project proceeds slowly with many tears over mistakes. Progress, but fragile and uneven.\n16-30\nGradual healing. Bianca improves, though slowly. She completes a simple gift for Lucia—imperfect but heartfelt. Her relationship with her sisters shows small signs of warmth. She still resists formal lessons but no longer cries when tutors arrive. The angry outbursts become less frequent. She asks occasionally to ride with Papa again. A long road ahead, but she is walking it.\n31-50\nSteady progress. The intervention has taken root. Bianca throws herself into sewing with Marta, finding genuine satisfaction in the craft. She presents Lucia with a small handkerchief—crooked stitches but recognizable orange blossoms—and glows at her mother's praise. She lets Juana sleep in her bed without complaint. Her lessons improve as her anxiety eases. She still has difficult moments, but they are moments, not months.\n51-70\nReal transformation. Bianca blossoms. The sewing becomes a true passion—Marta reports she has natural patience for detail work. She makes ribbons for Teresa and Juana, and the act of giving fills something in her that was empty before. She begins her letters again with new willingness. She speaks of being a \"big sister\" with pride. The household notices the change; servants comment that the princess smiles now.\n71-85\nRemarkable turnaround. Bianca transforms from the troubled child of months past into a warm, purposeful girl. Her sewing is genuinely impressive for her age—Marta says she has the d'Este eye for beauty. She mothers Teresa and Juana with patience that surprises everyone. Her lessons progress rapidly once the emotional blockage clears. She asks questions, laughs easily, and no longer clings. Lucia weeps with relief.\n86-95\nFlourishing. The breakthrough unlocks something profound. Bianca discovers she has gifts after all—not Catalina's cleverness or Fernando's boldness, but a gentle creativity and emotional depth. Her sewing is beautiful; her care for her siblings genuine and wise beyond her years. She begins her letters with enthusiasm and shows early aptitude. The middle child has found her place, and it is a good one.\n96-100\nExceptional growth. Bianca's transformation is extraordinary. The anxious, angry child becomes a source of warmth in the household. Her needlework shows true artistry—Marta suggests she could surpass her teacher in time. She reads to her younger siblings at night, settles their quarrels with diplomacy, and carries herself with quiet confidence. Her formal education flourishes. Juan's single afternoon on horseback has changed the trajectory of a life.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Bianca's development."

This is a very positive result - Bianca transforms significantly, her sewing becomes impressive, she mothers her younger siblings well, her lessons progress rapidly, and Lucia is relieved.\n\nI should narrate this in a satisfying way that shows the transformation without being too saccharine. Then I should stop and let the player take action.\n\n\nResult: 74 — Remarkable Turnaround\n\n\nOver the Following Year\n\n\nThe change does not happen all at once—but it happens.\n\n\nIn the weeks after that afternoon ride through Toledo, Bianca can be found most days in Marta's small workroom near the servants' quarters. She sits on a stool, tongue poking out in concentration, learning to thread needles and make stitches that don't pucker. She pricks her fingers. She makes mistakes. She unpicks seams and starts again.\n\n\nBut she does not cry. She does not quit.\n\n\nThe handkerchief for Lucia takes her two months. The orange blossoms in the corners are uneven—one noticeably larger than the others—and the \"L\" she embroiders in the center leans slightly to the left. But when she presents it to her mother on her birthday, wrapped in a scrap of leftover silk, Lucia holds it as though it were made of gold.\n\n\n\"You made this?\" Lucia whispers. \"Yourself?\"\n\n\n\"Marta helped,\" Bianca admits. \"But I did the flowers. And the letter. That's your initial, Mama. L for Lucia.\"\n\n\nLucia wears the handkerchief tucked into her sleeve for weeks afterward. Bianca notices. Everyone notices her noticing.\n\n\n\nThe ribbons for Teresa and Juana come next—simpler work, but done with care. Teresa's has a small bird, as promised. Juana's has something that might be a butterfly, if you look at it from the right angle. The girls wear them constantly, showing them off to anyone who will look.\n\n\n\"Bianca made it,\" Teresa tells visitors solemnly. \"My sister.\"\n\n\nAnd something shifts in Bianca when she hears this. The tightness in her shoulders begins to ease. The wariness in her eyes softens.\n\n\n\nBy winter, she no longer clings to Lucia. She still seeks her mother's company, still wants to be near her—but it is the wanting of a child who knows she is loved, not the desperate grasping of one who fears she is not.\n\n\nShe lets Juana sleep in her bed when nightmares come, and does not complain about the kicking.\n\n\nShe helps Teresa learn her letters, sitting beside her with patient repetition that surprises the tutors.\n\n\nShe begins her own lessons again—not with enthusiasm, exactly, but without the tears and resistance that marked before. Her letters are neat. Her memory is good. Marta says she has the d'Este eye for color and form; perhaps there is something there worth cultivating.\n\n\n\nOne evening, Lucia comes to you in the solar, her eyes bright.\n\n\n\"She asked me today,\" Lucia says, \"if she could learn to embroider pictures. Real pictures—not just flowers and initials. She wants to make a scene of Toledo for your study. The cathedral and the river and the bridge.\"\n\n\nLucia shakes her head, wonderingly.\n\n\n\"Six months ago she would not hold a needle. Now she dreams of embroidering cathedrals.\" She takes your hand. \"Whatever you said to her on that horse, Juan... it worked. She is becoming herself. And herself is someone rather wonderful.\""

This is a nice family moment that shows the developing bond between the half-sisters and Bianca's continued growth.\n\nI should write this as a warm domestic scene, showing:\n- Catalina as the older, more confident sister helping guide Bianca\n- Bianca's newfound confidence but still deferring somewhat to Catalina\n- The dynamic between the two girls\n- Juan and Lucia observing as proud parents\n- Perhaps some cute dialogue about colors and styles\n\nI'll keep it relatively short and stop at a natural point where Juan can take action or speak.\n\n\nThe dressmaker's workshop adjoins the Alcázar—a bright room with tall windows that let in the winter light. Bolts of fabric line the walls: Castilian wools in deep reds and rich browns, Italian silks in every color imaginable, Flemish linens crisp and white. The master tailor, a Florentine named Ser Benedetto who followed Lucia from Ferrara, stands ready with his measuring cord and a look of patient amusement.\n\n\nYou and Lucia sit to one side, close enough to watch but far enough to let the girls feel they are making their own choices.\n\n\nCatalina, at seven, approaches the task with scholarly seriousness. She walks along the bolts of fabric, touching each one, tilting her head as she considers. She has done this before—she knows what suits her coloring, what befits her station.\n\n\n\"Blue,\" she announces. \"A deep blue, like the sea near Constantinople. Do you remember the sea, Bianca? Papa took me when I was small.\"\n\n\nBianca shakes her head. She hangs back slightly, overwhelmed by the choices, but there is none of the old anxiety in her posture. She is simply a younger sister following an older one's lead.\n\n\n\"I don't remember,\" Bianca says. \"I wasn't born yet.\"\n\n\n\"Oh.\" Catalina pauses, then reaches back and takes Bianca's hand—a casual gesture, utterly natural. \"Well, it was very blue. Like this one.\" She points to a bolt of azure silk. \"But I think I want darker. More like evening.\"\n\n\nShe tugs Bianca forward. \"What color do you want? You have to choose yourself—Papa said so.\"\n\n\nBianca looks at the fabrics, then back at Lucia, as if seeking permission. Lucia nods encouragingly.\n\n\nSlowly, Bianca reaches out and touches a bolt of soft wool in a warm rose color—not pink, not red, but somewhere between. The color of sunset on Toledo's walls.\n\n\n\"This one?\" she says, half-question, half-declaration. \"It's... it's like the sky when the sun goes down. When everything turns soft.\"\n\n\nCatalina considers this with the gravity of a councilor weighing policy.\n\n\n\"That's pretty,\" she pronounces. \"It will look nice with your hair. Mama, don't you think it will look nice with her hair?\""

This is a moment of connection between mother and daughter.\n\n\nLucia rises from her seat and crosses to where Bianca stands, the rose-colored wool still under her small fingers. She kneels down to Bianca's height—something you have noticed she does more often now, meeting the children at their level rather than speaking down to them.\n\n\nShe takes a fold of the fabric and holds it up near Bianca's face, studying the effect with the practiced eye of a woman raised in the d'Este court, where beauty and art were serious matters.\n\n\n\"The color brings out the warmth in your skin,\" Lucia says softly. \"And it complements your eyes—see how it makes the brown look almost golden?\" She smooths a strand of hair from Bianca's face. \"You have good instincts, piccola mia. This is not a choice a child makes. This is a choice a woman makes.\"\n\n\nBianca's cheeks flush—with pleasure, not anxiety.\n\n\n\"Really, Mama?\"\n\n\n\"Really.\" Lucia looks up at Ser Benedetto. \"The rose wool for Princess Bianca. And I think...\" She glances at the fabric, then at Bianca's hands—the fingers that have grown nimble with needlework these past months. \"I think perhaps some gold embroidery at the cuffs and collar. Simple, elegant. Something she might even help stitch herself, if she wishes.\"\n\n\nBianca's eyes go wide. \"I could help make my own dress?\"\n\n\n\"If Ser Benedetto permits,\" Lucia says, glancing at the tailor.\n\n\nThe Florentine bows, a smile creasing his weathered face. \"It would be an honor to have the princess's assistance. Marta speaks highly of her work.\"\n\n\nBianca turns to Catalina, practically vibrating with excitement. \"Did you hear? I get to help!\"\n\n\nCatalina nods sagely, still holding her bolt of evening-blue silk. \"That's because you're good at sewing. I'm good at reading. Everyone has their thing.\" She says it without jealousy—simply stating a fact.\n\n\nLucia catches your eye across the room, and her smile says everything."

The dress fits her beautifully—Ser Benedetto's work is impeccable as always—but it is the gold embroidery at the cuffs and collar that draws the eye. Small orange blossoms, delicate and even, stitched by Bianca's own hand over weeks of careful work.\n\n\nShe looks up at you, and for a moment you see the old fear flicker in her eyes—the worry that she is not enough, that she will disappoint, that no one will notice.\n\n\nBut only for a moment.\n\n\n\"I'm scared, Papa,\" she admits quietly. \"What if they don't like it?

Bianca learning to sew with Marta\n14. Dress reveal ceremony for Bianca and Catalina\n \nI'll catalog the key individuals involved in this chapter's events. The roster includes diplomatic representatives like Musa Keita and economic experts such as Giacomo Ferrante and Don Rodrigo de Ponce. The royal family is prominently represented, with Queen Lucia d'Este and their children Catalina, Fernando, Bianca, Teresa, Juana, and Nicolás playing significant roles. Supporting characters like Marta the seamstress and Ser Benedetto the tailor provide depth to the chapter's narrative, particularly around the children's personal development and social interactions.\n\nThe performance metrics reveal nuanced outcomes across multiple domains. Salt production exceeded baseline projections, generating 38,000-40,000 quintales by 1444. African trade infrastructure showed limitations, with only 4-5 caravels and restricted outposts. Gold trade performed solidly, achieving approximately 1,000 pounds annually. Most intriguingly, the children's developmental trajectories varied dramatically - Fernando exceeded expectations, while Bianca experienced a remarkable transformation from an initially challenging start to significant personal growth.\n\n\nView: Reading the docx skill for creating the chapter summary document\n\n\nThought process: Identified chapter reference and initiated summary document creation.\n\nI need to check the chapter number.
