Excavated narrative context and NPC motivations for current scene









Now let me search for the current state of affairs in Rome and available contacts:


Reconstructed political landscape and identified potential Roman contacts








March 19, 1434 Palazzo di San Marco, Rome Late Afternoon

The blood orange rinds lie curled on the table between you, their bitter-sweet scent filling the small chamber. Through the narrow window, Rome's afternoon light stretches long shadows across the floor. Catalina has been taken to the nursery by her nurse, exhausted from the morning's Mass and the excitement of the market.

Lucia sits across from you, one hand resting absently on her belly—the habit has already begun, though she's barely showing. The color has returned to her face after the oranges. She's been quiet since your account of Torquemada, processing.

"So." She taps one finger against the table. "Cardinal Orsini treats Fray Hernando like a stranger. The Camera clerk spoke for thirty minutes and said nothing. The French are watching us. And a Dominican has offered to make himself useful in ways that should make us uncomfortable." Her grey-green eyes fix on you. "What do we actually know before your audience with the Holy Father?"

The question hangs in the air.

You know less than you'd like. Eugenius summoned you—that means something. Cardinal Capranica caught your eye at Mass, murmured that the Pope was watching. Someone in the Vatican waved back at Catalina. The French faction monitors your movements. But the substance—what Eugenius actually thinks about parallel legislation, about Basel, about the crusade termination problem—remains opaque.

"The Medici agent," Lucia says slowly, reading your silence. "I could try a different approach. Ask not about Camera finances—clearly they won't speak of that—but about people. Who in the Vatican might actually receive us. Who owes the Medici money and might welcome a new friend." She pauses. "Or there's Capranica. He made himself visible deliberately. That was not accident."

She counts on her fingers: "Capranica. The Medici connection. The Dominican who wants something. Cardinal Orsini, if we can understand why he's suddenly cold." A fourth finger. "Or we wait. The papal audience is in three days. Perhaps the information will come to us."

The afternoon light shifts. Somewhere below, you hear the distant sound of your crusaders in the courtyard—the clink of harness, a burst of laughter. 591 men waiting to march to Constantinople, and you still don't know what the Pope will say when you kneel before him.

Lets see if we can speak with anyone before the audience. Take care love, but if you can help me with this, I would appreciate it a lot. 

Draft a d100 table to see if I can speak with anyone before the audience.

Architected d100 contact table weighing Vatican political dynamics and success factors












Lucia nods, a flicker of determination crossing her features. "I'll try the Medici approach differently this time. Not asking about finances—asking about people. Cosimo's agent here deals with half the cardinals in Rome. He knows who owes money, who's ambitious, who might welcome a conversation with a king who has actual soldiers."

She rises, smoothing her gown. "And Capranica. He showed himself at Mass for a reason. Perhaps I send word that we noticed, and we're grateful for his... attention."

D100: Pre-Audience Intelligence Gathering
The Approach: Lucia works the Medici banking network to identify approachable Vatican figures, while also following up on Capranica's deliberate signal at Mass.

Success Factors
Capranica already made himself visible—he wants contact
The Medici have leverage throughout Rome (debts, favors, information)
Juan's 591 crusaders represent real commitment to Constantinople—this matters to anyone who cares about the East
Lucia is politically astute and speaks Italian natively
Juan completed the Reconquista—unprecedented moral authority
Failure Factors
The Vatican is deliberately maintaining distance (Orsini's coldness suggests instructions)
French faction actively monitoring Juan's movements
Eugenius may want to assess Juan personally before anyone briefs him
Vatican courtiers fear being seen to align before the Pope's position is clear
Camera finances are troubled—makes everyone defensive
Three days is very little time to penetrate Vatican caution
The Table
1-10: Backfire The Medici agent reports that Lucia's inquiries have been noticed—and not favorably. Someone interprets the questions as Juan trying to gather intelligence to use against the Holy Father. Word reaches French-aligned cardinals. When Juan enters his audience, Eugenius will have heard that the Castilian king was "fishing" before bothering to present himself properly. The Vatican's cold distance becomes colder. No useful intelligence gained; suspicion increased.

11-25: Locked Doors Everyone is waiting. The Medici agent explains apologetically: no one in the Vatican will commit to anything before the Pope himself has spoken with Juan. Capranica does not respond to the overture—perhaps he's reconsidered, perhaps he's been warned off. Orsini remains unreachable. The message is clear: present yourself to the Holy Father first, then we'll see. Juan enters his audience blind, knowing only that Rome is watching and judging.

26-40: Context Without Access The Medici agent provides useful background but no direct contacts. Lucia learns: Eugenius is financially desperate (the Camera's evasiveness confirms this); the French faction has 8-10 cardinals who oppose any strengthening of papal-Castilian ties; Cardinal d'Allemand in Basel has allies here who report everything; the Pope is interested in Juan but deeply cautious about anyone who might become too powerful an ally. Capranica sends a brief, noncommittal acknowledgment—he's interested but won't move before the audience. Juan enters knowing the landscape but not the Pope's mind.

41-55: Capranica's Caution Cardinal Capranica agrees to a brief, private conversation—but insists on discretion. He meets Lucia (not Juan directly) in a church near the Pantheon, speaking for perhaps fifteen minutes. He confirms: the Pope watched the Mass procession from his window and was impressed by the crusaders' discipline; Eugenius genuinely cares about Constantinople; the parallel legislation concept has reached Rome through Basel correspondence and Eugenius has not rejected it outright. But Capranica won't say more—he's testing the waters, not committing. Juan enters his audience with fragments: the Pope is interested, not hostile, but the Vatican is divided and cautious.

56-70: The Banker's Whisper The Medici agent does better than expected. He identifies a Camera official—not senior, but informed—who owes the Medici bank a substantial sum and might appreciate a friendly word. This official, after careful approach, reveals: Eugenius is desperate for the Constantinople expedition to succeed because it would strengthen his position against Basel; the Pope fears Juan might be too aligned with the Council; the termination criteria question is something Eugenius has thought about and has opinions on; the French faction is pushing Eugenius to be suspicious of Castilian influence. Additionally, Capranica sends word that he looks forward to speaking with His Majesty after the audience—a signal of future access. Juan enters knowing key concerns and that doors may open afterward.

71-85: Capranica's Gamble Capranica takes a calculated risk. He invites Juan himself—not just Lucia—to an evening conversation at his residence, carefully informal, "two servants of the Church discussing how best to serve." Over wine, Capranica is remarkably frank: Eugenius needs Juan's expedition to succeed, but fears becoming dependent on a foreign king; the parallel legislation idea intrigues the Pope because it offers a face-saving path, but powerful cardinals oppose any compromise with Basel; the French faction has been whispering that Juan seeks to dominate the Church through military strength; Eugenius will test Juan's humility and his willingness to subordinate Castilian interests to papal authority. Capranica offers no promises but provides a map of the terrain. Juan enters his audience understanding what the Pope fears and what he hopes for.

86-95: The Back Channel Through a combination of Medici leverage and Capranica's intervention, Juan receives something unexpected: a private message from Cardinal Orsini explaining his earlier coldness. Orsini writes that he was instructed to maintain distance until the Pope assessed Juan personally—but he remains Juan's friend and wanted Juan to understand: Eugenius fears that accepting Juan's parallel legislation framework means admitting Basel has legitimate authority; the Pope needs a way to adopt reforms without appearing to yield to conciliar pressure; if Juan can offer that—reforms as papal initiative rather than conciliar victory—Eugenius will be receptive. Orsini will speak with Juan after the audience, openly. Juan enters knowing exactly what Eugenius needs to hear.

96-100: Providence The Pope sends his own signal. Through Capranica, through the Medici, through channels that seem almost impossibly coordinated, Juan receives word: Eugenius watched the Mass procession and wept. The sight of 591 crusaders in white, unarmed, carrying the cross to St. Peter's—this moved him profoundly. He has been praying about Juan's arrival. He wants to believe this is Providence answering his crisis. Before the formal audience, a papal secretary delivers a private note: "His Holiness looks forward to speaking with a son of the Church who acts rather than merely speaks." The audience will not be a test. It will be a conversation between men who need each other. Juan enters knowing he has already won something essential: the Pope's hope.

Shall I roll, or do you have a d100 ready?

Orchestrated narrative outcome with constrained intelligence gathering




March 20, 1434 Palazzo di San Marco, Rome Evening

Lucia returns after dark, her face drawn with fatigue. She waves away the servant offering wine and sinks into the chair across from you, pulling off her gloves with deliberate care.

"Context," she says finally. "Not access. But context."

She spent the afternoon with the Medici agent—a Florentine named Bardi who manages Cosimo's Roman interests. He received her graciously, served excellent wine, and spoke for two hours without ever quite answering a direct question. But Lucia knows how to listen to what isn't said.

"The Camera is in trouble. Real trouble." She ticks off points on her fingers. "Bardi wouldn't say how bad, but the way he didn't say it told me enough. Eugenius has been Pope for three years and the treasury has bled the entire time. Milan's wars, the Colonna troubles, Basel draining his authority—and with it, his revenues. The annates reform decree? Bardi laughed when I mentioned it. Said if Basel's version passes, the Camera loses three-quarters of its income from benefices."

She pauses, gathering her thoughts.

"The French. Eight to ten cardinals here are aligned with Cardinal d'Allemand in Basel. They send reports. Everything you do, everything we do—it reaches Basel within a week. Bardi says they've been... interpreting your arrival. A foreign king with 600 soldiers, marching on St. Peter's." Her mouth twists. "They're not calling it piety. They're calling it pressure."

The fire crackles. Outside, Rome's church bells mark the hour.

"And the Pope himself?" She shrugs, frustrated. "Interested. Cautious. Bardi says Eugenius genuinely cares about Constantinople—it's not political theater for him. But he's been burned before. He trusted the Council at first, sent Cesarini as his legate, and then they declared themselves superior to him. He trusted Sigismund's mediation, and Como gave him nothing but delay." She meets your eyes. "He's a man who wants to believe but has learned that belief costs him."

Finally, the question you most wanted answered:

"Parallel legislation. Bardi had heard of it—which means it's reached Rome through Basel correspondence. He said Eugenius hasn't rejected it outright." She holds up a hand before you can speak. "But he hasn't accepted it either. Bardi's sense is that the Pope is waiting to see what kind of man proposes it. Whether you're offering him a ladder out of a hole, or digging the hole deeper."

She reaches into her sleeve and produces a small folded paper.

"Capranica. He received my message. Sent this back."

The note is brief, written in a secretary's careful hand:

His Eminence thanks the Queen of Castile for her gracious words and hopes that Providence will guide all servants of Christ toward understanding. He remains, as always, attentive to the needs of Holy Mother Church.

Lucia watches your face as you read it.

"He's interested. But he won't move before your audience." She sighs. "No one will. The entire Vatican is waiting to see what Eugenius does with you before they decide what they think."

She leans back, exhaustion evident.

"So. You enter your audience knowing the Pope is desperate, suspicious, genuinely devout, and surrounded by people telling him to fear you. You know the French are whispering. You know the money is bad. You know parallel legislation hasn't been rejected." A tired smile. "You don't know what he'll say when you kneel before him. But you know what he's afraid of."

The audience is in two days.

Lucia, we have been trying to speak to anyone of the vatican before the meeting. It has all come up dry. 

Do you think there is anything left we can do? I can visit St Paul's every day, hoping I meet someone.

7 dec 2025

Weighed patience against persistence, counseled strategic restraint







Lucia is quiet for a long moment, studying you with those grey-green eyes. When she speaks, her voice is gentle but direct.

"Juan. Amore mio." She reaches across the table and takes your hand. "The Vatican has answered us. We simply don't like the answer."

She squeezes once, then releases.

"Every door we've knocked on has opened just enough to say wait. Orsini won't see us. The Camera clerk spoke and said nothing. Capranica sends polite words and no invitation. The Medici agent gives us context but no contacts." She spreads her hands. "This is not failure. This is instruction. They are telling us: the Pope will see you in two days. Present yourself. Stop trying to go around him."

She rises, moves to the window, looks out at Rome's darkening streets.

"If you go to St. Peter's every day, kneeling conspicuously, hoping someone important notices—what does that look like? A king who is anxious. A king who doesn't trust his own position enough to simply wait for his audience." She turns back to you. "The French faction is already whispering that you marched on St. Peter's to pressure the Holy Father. Do you want to give them more to whisper about?"

Her expression softens.

"You completed the Reconquista. You brought 591 knights to fight for Constantinople. You carry letters from the Emperor. You have earned this audience." She crosses back to you, stands close. "You don't need to scheme your way into the Pope's favor. You need to walk in there and be the man who wrote me that letter in Ferrara—the one who said he only ever set out to do good, and fight for what is right."

She touches your cheek.

"What would Fray Hernando tell you? That God's timing is not ours to force?"

A pause. The fire crackles.

"Rest. Pray. Prepare what you will say. And trust that when you kneel before Eugenius, the truth of who you are will be enough."

I know enough. Thank you for the clarity. 

I have things to do. Keep good rest love, I will be back later today. 

Captain! We ride to Ostia. Get a guard ready to come along with me.

7 dec 2025

Rationalized character's sudden departure to inspect fleet operations






Lucia blinks at your sudden pivot, mouth half-open to respond. But she knows you well enough by now. She closes her mouth, nods once, and the ghost of a smile crosses her face.

"Of course you do."

She doesn't ask why. She doesn't try to stop you. She simply rises on her toes, kisses your cheek, and says: "Don't drown. I'm not raising these children alone."

The Courtyard, Palazzo di San Marco Minutes Later

Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles looks up from the game of dice he was losing to Sergeant García. His weathered face shows no surprise—he learned long ago that kings do not explain themselves.

"Ostia, Your Majesty? Now?"

The sun is already low. It's fifteen miles to the harbor. You'll arrive after dark if you push, or sleep on the road if you don't.

"How many men?"

He's already moving as he asks, gesturing to García, who's scooping up the dice and bellowing for horses.

The Road to Ostia Dusk

You ride with twelve men—enough to discourage bandits, few enough to move fast. The Via Ostiense stretches before you, ancient stones worn smooth by a thousand years of traffic. The Tiber flows dark and slow to your left, carrying barges toward the sea.

The air changes as Rome falls behind. Cooler. Cleaner. Salt on the wind.

Fernán rides at your shoulder, silent. He's served you long enough to know when you want conversation and when you want the road. Tonight, he gives you the road.

The stars emerge. Orion. The Pleiades. The same stars that hung over Granada when the city fell, over Toledo when Fernando was born, over the storm that took seventy-five of your men.

Your mind clears with each mile. The Vatican's games, the French whispers, Torquemada's hook—all of it recedes. Ahead is Ostia. Your ships. Your men. Something real.

Ostia Harbor Night

Torches burn along the quay. Your fleet rides at anchor—ten ships, dark shapes against the moonlit water. The Princess Catalina sits proudest among them, the flagship you commissioned for this journey.

The harbor watch recognizes your banner and word spreads fast. By the time you dismount, men are emerging from taverns and billets, pulling on clothes, straightening themselves. Not the 591 in Rome—these are the sailors, the ship's officers, the skeleton crews keeping the fleet ready.

A grizzled figure pushes through the gathering crowd. Captain Sebastián de Morales, master of the Princess Catalina, veteran of the Málaga blockade. He bows stiffly—a sailor's bow, not a courtier's.

"Your Majesty. We weren't expecting—" He stops himself. "The ships are ready. Whatever you need."

The salt wind pulls at your cloak. The harbor water laps against the hulls. Your men stand waiting, uncertain why their king has ridden through the night to stand on a dark quay.

What are you here for?

Greetings captain. I am here to conduct some naval excercises. I plan to conduct them from the princess Catalina. It is already late. Can the captains of all the vessels be summoned to come aboard at this hour? Or is it prudent to wait untill morning?

7 dec 2025

Weighed practical logistics against royal authority and deference






Captain Morales scratches his salt-crusted beard, calculating. He's not a man to waste words or hide practical realities behind courtly deference.

"Five captains are aboard their ships now, Majesty—night watch routine. The other five..." He gestures vaguely toward the cluster of buildings along the harbor front. "Ashore. Taverns, billets. Sober, mostly—I've kept them on short leash since the Mistral." A flicker of old grief crosses his face at the mention of the storm. "I can have runners fetch them within the hour. Faster if they haven't found comfortable company."

He glances at the moonlit water, then back to you.

"As for exercises—depends what you have in mind. Signals, formations, sail handling—that wants daylight and sea room, not harbor at night. But if it's council you're after, getting the captains around a table to plan, talk through maneuvers before we execute them..." He shrugs. "That can happen whenever Your Majesty commands. The Catalina's great cabin has room enough."

Fernán has dismounted beside you, saying nothing, but you can feel his curiosity. Naval exercises, two days before a papal audience. He's wondering what you're thinking.

Morales adds, practically: "The men have had weeks of idleness, Majesty. Waiting in harbor while Rome decides things." There's no accusation in his tone, just observation. "A king who comes to drill them, who shows he remembers they exist—that's worth something. Whether tonight or dawn."

He waits for your decision.

GM: Think about how long we have actually been in Rome. I was told earlier that the pope would grant me audience quite fast and I have have spent only a few days yet in Rome in my experience.

The actual naval exercises will be done tomorrow. The planning, we do this evening. Summon all the captains to the Catalina. 

I turn to my guard company. 

You can have a rest. I will be with the fleet for the biggest part of tomorrow and will return tomorrow evening with you. You can take a rest until then.

7 dec 2025

Reconciled timeline discrepancies and validated character decisions







You're right to correct me. The fleet arrived at Ostia only days ago—March 18th, after the harrowing voyage from Cagliari following the Mistral disaster. The summons to audience came quickly; Eugenius did not make you wait.

Ostia Harbor Night, March 20, 1434

Morales nods at your command. "Aye, Majesty. All captains to the Catalina within the hour." He turns and barks orders—runners scatter into the darkness toward the harbor-front buildings.

Captain Fernán receives your dismissal with a slight frown—he doesn't love leaving you, even among your own fleet—but he knows better than to argue.

"Tomorrow evening, then. We'll find billets here in Ostia." He clasps his fist to his chest. "God keep Your Majesty."

The twelve guardsmen lead their horses toward the town's modest stable, their torches bobbing into the darkness. You're left on the quay with Morales and the salt wind.

"This way, Majesty."

A longboat carries you across the black water to the Princess Catalina. She's beautiful even in moonlight—fresh timber, clean lines, the Castilian banner hanging limp at her stern. You commissioned her for this voyage. For Lucia. For Constantinople.

The great cabin is smaller than a palace chamber but larger than any other ship could offer. A heavy table dominates the center, bolted to the deck. Charts already spread across it—the Italian coast, the route to Rhodes, the Aegean approaches.

Morales lights lanterns while you wait.

One by one, the captains arrive. Some neat, some rumpled from hasty waking. Ten men commanding ten ships—what remains of your expedition fleet after the Mistral took her toll. They file in, bow, find places around the table. Curious. Alert. A king who rides through the night to plan exercises is a king who takes his fleet seriously.

When all ten are assembled, Morales closes the cabin door.

"Your Majesty. Your captains."

Twenty eyes fixed on you, waiting.

What do you want to accomplish tonight?

Thank you all for coming. I have an audience with the pope in two days. I may need a few days after that to wrap up business in Rome, afterwards we sail to Naples immediately. 

The storm has shook us all and I want to take some time tomorrow to prepare. If ever we are hit again by a storm, we know exactly what to do. 

First of all. When we first saw the mistral, what actually happened on every ship? Did everyone knew what was going on? We used some flag signals. Did anyone actually see them and was it usefull?

7 dec 2025

Reconstructed storm chaos and prepared varied captain testimonies







The cabin falls quiet. The lanterns sway gently with the harbor's slight motion, casting shifting shadows across weathered faces. You've asked the question no one wanted to revisit.

Captain Morales glances at his fellow captains, then speaks first—it's his flagship, his responsibility to break the silence.

"The truth, Majesty?" He rubs his jaw. "When the Mistral hit, every ship fought alone. That's not how it should be. That's how it was."

A younger captain—Gaspar de Vega of the Santa Clara—shifts uncomfortably. "We saw the flags from the Catalina. The signal to form line and run southeast, away from the coast." He hesitates. "We saw them. But by the time we read them, the squall was already on us. I had men fighting canvas, the helm bucking like a mule. I couldn't hold course to follow anyone. I did what I had to do to keep my ship alive."

Nods around the table. No one contradicts him.

Diego Fernández, master of the San Marcos—an older man, grey-bearded, survivor of a dozen campaigns—leans forward. "Flag signals in a Mistral are like shouting across a battlefield when the cannons fire. Everyone's too busy staying alive to look up." He spreads his hands. "It's not a failing of the men. It's a failing of the method. Flags need clear sky, calm sea, time to read and respond. A storm gives you none of that."

"We lost sight of each other within minutes," adds Rodrigo Ibáñez of the Nuestra Señora. His voice is quieter—he lost eleven men. "The rain came horizontal. Couldn't see the ship ahead, couldn't see the ship behind. I didn't know who'd survived until we limped into Cagliari two days later and started counting masts."

Morales picks up the thread again. "Your Majesty asked if the signals were useful. Honest answer: no. Not once the storm was on us. Maybe—maybe—if we'd had more warning, if we'd formed up before the weather turned, the signals might have kept us together. But once the wind hit..." He shakes his head.

Another captain—Luis de Córdoba of the Santiago Apóstol—clears his throat. He's been quiet until now, arms crossed, face unreadable.

"There's another problem, Majesty. We've never drilled this. Not properly. Every captain in this cabin knows his own ship, knows how to fight a storm alone. But fighting a storm together? Keeping formation when the sea wants to scatter us? Knowing where to regroup if we lose sight?" He looks around the table. "We've never practiced it. We assumed we'd figure it out when the time came."

A heavy silence.

"We figured it out," he finishes quietly. "Seventy-five men paid for the lesson."

The lantern flames flicker. Ten captains wait to hear what their king makes of their honesty.

Lets focus our energy on being better prepared now. 

Was there a difference in the moment each ship realized that a storm was coming for us? That some had more time to react and prepare? 

And if there was a difference, what can we do to alert others in the future?

7 dec 2025

Examined warning sign disparities and devised communication protocols





The captains exchange glances. This is the right question, and they know it.

Morales turns to the man on his left. "Gaspar. You were on the northern edge of the formation. What did you see?"

Gaspar de Vega leans forward, remembering. "We saw the cloud bank first. Low on the horizon, moving fast—dark grey with that yellow tinge underneath. I've seen Mistrals before, sailing out of Valencia. I knew what it was maybe... ten minutes before it hit us?" He shrugs. "Ten minutes. Enough to get the men on deck, shorten sail, secure loose cargo. Not enough to do more than that."

"We had less," says Rodrigo Ibáñez bitterly. "The Nuestra Señora was on the southern edge, closer to the coast. Sardinia blocked our view of the northwest. First warning I had was when the Santa Clara's sails started thrashing. Then the wind was on us. Five minutes, maybe. Men were still coming up from below when the first wave broke over the bow."

Diego Fernández—the old grey-beard—strokes his chin thoughtfully. "I had a man in the crow's nest who's sailed the Gulf of Lion for twenty years. He called it before anyone. Saw the way the sea was changing—the chop getting shorter, angrier—before the clouds were even visible from the deck. He shouted down, I looked up, and I started giving orders." He pauses. "Fifteen minutes. Maybe more. We had time to rig lifelines, double-lash the boats, get every man who couldn't swim tied to something solid."

"And you lost how many?" Morales asks quietly.

"Three." Diego's voice is heavy. "Three men. Not eleven. Not fifteen."

The difference hangs in the air. Fifteen minutes versus five minutes. Three dead versus fifteen dead.

Luis de Córdoba uncrosses his arms. "So the lesson is clear enough. The ships that saw it coming survived better. But seeing it coming depended on where you were in the formation, and whether you had a man aloft who knew what to look for."

"Not just aloft," adds another captain—Martín de Soria of the Reina del Mar. He's been quiet until now, a compact man with hands like knotted rope. "Aloft and watching for weather, not watching for pirates or coastline. A dedicated weather eye. That's different from a normal lookout."

Morales nods slowly. "So. We post weather watches. Experienced men, eyes on the horizon, looking for exactly this. That's one thing."

"But that only helps the ship that sees it," Gaspar interjects. "How do we tell the others? I saw the Mistral coming, I started preparing my own ship—I didn't have time to signal anyone else. And even if I had, what signal? We have flags for 'enemy sighted' and 'form line' and 'follow me.' Do we have a flag for 'storm coming, prepare immediately'?"

Silence around the table.

"No," Morales admits. "We don't."

Diego Fernández taps the table. "Flags won't work anyway, not if the weather's already turning. You need something faster. Something you can't miss even if you're not looking."

"Cannon," says Luis de Córdoba flatly. "One gun. Every captain knows: a single gun fired outside of battle means attend, something is wrong. Three guns in succession—that could mean storm warning. You hear cannon, you don't need to see anything. You react."

"Expensive," mutters someone. "Powder and shot, every time the sky looks grey."

"Cheaper than seventy-five men," Luis replies, and no one argues.

Morales looks to you, Majesty. "A dedicated weather watch with experienced eyes. A cannon signal for immediate danger—something every ship will hear regardless of visibility. And perhaps..." he hesitates, "a predetermined plan for what to do when we hear it. Not waiting for flag orders that may never come. Every captain knowing: if you hear three guns, you shorten sail, rig lifelines, secure cargo, and make for the nearest safe bearing. No waiting for instructions."

He spreads his hands over the charts.

"What else would Your Majesty have us consider?"

I was thinking the same thing. As soon as we hear a cannon firing means all hands on deck anyway and to get ready. It could also mean actual combat but I think everyone will be able to determine what is going on. 

Before we depart on a major journey, we have a council with all captains so everyone knows where we are going, what to look for and what we could do when a storm hits us, what harbour we can take shelter in. 

Has every ship a cannon for this signal?

7 dec 2025

Assessed historical cannon availability across diverse fleet vessels






The captains look at each other. A few grimace.

Morales answers first. "The Catalina has four bombards. Small ones, but enough to make noise." He gestures around the cabin. "We're a flagship. We were built for a king."

Diego Fernández nods. "The San Marcos carries two. Old, but they fire."

One by one, the captains report. The picture that emerges is uneven:

Ship	Captain	Cannons
Princess Catalina	Morales	4
San Marcos	Diego Fernández	2
Santiago Apóstol	Luis de Córdoba	2
Santa Clara	Gaspar de Vega	1
Nuestra Señora	Rodrigo Ibáñez	0
Reina del Mar	Martín de Soria	1
San Vicente	Alonso Pardo	0
Esperanza	Tomás de Lepe	0
Santa María de la Mar	Francisco Ruiz	1
Buenaventura	Cristóbal Medina	0
Four ships carry nothing that can make the signal.

Rodrigo Ibáñez—who lost eleven men on the Nuestra Señora—speaks up, defensive but honest. "We're transports, Majesty. Genoese contracts. They gave us hulls to carry men and horses, not to fight. I've got crossbows and some hand-gonnes for boarding defense. No bombards."

"Same," mutters Alonso Pardo of the San Vicente. "We were never meant for battle."

Morales folds his arms. "So four ships can't give the signal. And if they're the ones who see the storm first..." He doesn't finish the sentence. He doesn't need to.

Luis de Córdoba drums his fingers on the table. "We could redistribute. Take one bombard from the Catalina, one from the San Marcos, put them on two of the unarmed ships. That leaves only two without."

"Or," Martín de Soria offers, "we assign the unarmed ships to positions in the formation where they'll never be the first to see weather coming. Keep them in the center, let the armed ships hold the edges."

"That might work for a Mistral," Diego says slowly. "Comes from the northwest, predictable direction. But other storms? Squalls can come from anywhere."

Gaspar de Vega raises a hand. "There's another option. Horns. A ship's horn, blown in a pattern—three long blasts, say—carries almost as far as a cannon shot. Every ship has a horn. Every ship can make that signal."

"Not as far as cannon," Luis counters. "Not in heavy wind. The sound gets swallowed."

"Better than nothing for the ships that have nothing," Gaspar replies.

Morales looks to you. "So we have choices, Majesty. Redistribute the guns we have. Rely on formation discipline to keep unarmed ships protected. Use horns as a secondary signal. Or..." he pauses, "we find four bombards in Rome or Naples before we sail for Constantinople, and make sure every ship can speak when it needs to."

We will not redistribute cannons. And we keep the cannon shot as the signal to be alert. 

The carracks have the biggest masts dont they? Do they have a crow's nest?

7 dec 2025

Reconstructed fleet composition and verified carrack rigging details








Morales nods, seeing where you're heading.

"Aye, Majesty. The carracks have the height." He gestures around the cabin. "The Catalina here, the San Marcos, the Santiago Apóstol, the Santa Clara—these are proper three-masted carracks. Crow's nests on the mainmast, thirty feet up or more. A man up there can see weather coming from leagues away, well before anyone on deck."

He pauses, does the mental count.

"Four carracks with proper crow's nests. The rest—" he glances at Rodrigo Ibáñez and the other transport captains, "—are Genoese cogs and transports. Lower profile. They have lookout positions, but not the same height. A man on a transport's mast sees maybe half the distance."

Diego Fernández, the grey-beard, adds: "It's why I saw the Mistral first on the San Marcos. Height. My man was looking down on the weather while the transports were still blind to it."

Luis de Córdoba traces a finger across the chart, thinking aloud. "So the carracks become our eyes. We position them at the edges of the formation—north, south, east, west. Transports in the center. The carracks watch the horizon, and when they see something..." He mimes a cannon firing.

"The transports hear the signal and prepare, even if they can't see the danger themselves," Gaspar finishes.

Morales turns to you. "Four carracks, four corners. It could work, Majesty. We'd need to drill it—make sure every captain knows his position, knows to hold it even when the sea gets rough. But the bones of a system are there."

He hesitates, then adds: "The Catalina has the tallest mainmast in the fleet. If Your Majesty wants the sharpest eyes in the highest nest, this is the ship to carry them. The question is—do we keep the flagship in the center where she's protected, or put her on the edge where she can see?"

I have led many charges from the front, also in this case we do not hide behind others if we dare not do it ourselves. We put the Catalina at the head of the formation in the best position to spot anything coming our way. 

When we spot antthing, we fire three cannons and this should alert every captain that is storm is coming. 

When a transport for example hears a shot, what are the first things they need to do?

7 dec 2025

Deliberated emergency procedures while deferring to experienced captains' expertise




The question lands on the table like a challenge. The transport captains shift in their seats—this is their domain now, their failures to reckon with.

Rodrigo Ibáñez speaks first. He lost eleven men. He's thought about this every night since Cagliari.

"First thing—all hands on deck. Every man, no exceptions. The ones below when the storm hits are the ones who drown when the hull breaches or the hatch seals them in." His voice is steady, but his knuckles are white on the table's edge. "I had men still climbing up when the first wave took us. They never had a chance."

Alonso Pardo of the San Vicente nods grimly. "Shorten sail. Immediately. You hear that cannon, you don't wait to see how bad it is. You reef everything down to storm canvas or bare poles. A ship with too much sail up in a Mistral—" he shakes his head. "The wind will roll you over or tear your masts out."

"Secure cargo," adds Tomás de Lepe of the Esperanza. "Especially the horses. A panicked horse breaking loose below decks in heavy seas..." He doesn't finish. Everyone's seen it. "Lash them tight, hobble them if you have to. Same with water barrels, weapons, anything that can shift."

Diego Fernández, the grey-beard who lost only three men, ticks off on his fingers: "Lifelines rigged bow to stern. Every man who can't swim—tied to something solid. Hatches secured but not sealed, you need to be able to get below if you must. Bilge pumps manned and ready."

"And know where you're going," Martín de Soria adds quietly. "Before the signal even comes. Every captain should know: if a storm hits here, I run there. Predetermined bearing toward safe harbor or open sea, whichever's wiser. No hesitation, no waiting for orders that won't come."

Morales has been listening, letting his captains speak. Now he summarizes:

"So. Three guns from a carrack means: all hands on deck, shorten sail, secure cargo and horses, rig lifelines, man the pumps, and run your predetermined heading." He looks around the table. "That's six things. Every man on every ship needs to know all six, in that order. No thinking. Just doing."

He turns to you, Majesty.

"We could drill this tomorrow. Not a full storm drill at sea—but the preparation. Time each crew from cannon signal to ready-state. See who's fast, who's slow, who needs more practice." A grim smile. "Make it a competition. Sailors love to prove their ship is better than the next."

We will do so tomorrow. We will drill tomorrow by sailing to open sea, then a carrack will "see a storm" and fire his cannons. We all get ready and sail back into Ostia harbour. 

What happens if we spot an enemy fleet? Could we adopt similar procedures for this?

GM: by the way, the cannon numbers from earlier in the conversation are incorrect. the Catalina has 8 cannons for example and I think the other carracks have more as well. Just remember this for later.

7 dec 2025

Reconciled cannon discrepancy and developed enemy fleet detection procedures



The captains lean forward with renewed interest. This is familiar territory—enemy fleets are something they've trained for, even if imperfectly.

Luis de Córdoba speaks first, the tactician among them. "Storm and enemy require opposite responses, Majesty. Storm means shorten sail, scatter if you must, every ship fights to survive alone. Enemy means more sail, form up tight, strength in numbers."

"Different signal then," Morales says, thinking aloud. "Three guns for storm. What for enemy? One gun has always meant attend—something's happening. Two guns could mean enemy sighted."

Gaspar de Vega nods. "Two guns, then flags to show direction and size. We have flags for that already—compass bearing, number of sails. That part works, as long as the weather's clear enough to read them."

Diego Fernández strokes his grey beard. "The question is what happens next. With a storm, every captain knows what to do—we just agreed on the six steps. But enemy fleet? Do we fight? Do we run? Do we protect the transports and let the carracks engage?"

"Depends on the enemy," Rodrigo Ibáñez says quietly. He commands a transport—unarmed, vulnerable. "Ottoman war galleys? Genoese pirates? A French squadron that claims we're in their waters?" He shakes his head. "Each demands something different."

Morales turns to you. "This is where the pre-voyage council matters most, Majesty. Before we sail, we agree: if we meet enemies in this stretch of water, we do this. Ottomans near Rhodes—we form line and fight, we have knights aboard who'll want to close and board. Pirates near Sardinia—we group tight and show strength, they'll seek easier prey. A superior fleet we cannot defeat—" he pauses, choosing words carefully, "—the carracks screen while the transports run."

"The transports carry the men," Luis adds bluntly. "Five hundred knights matter more than four carracks. If it comes to it, we buy time. That's what warships are for."

A heavy silence. The carrack captains accept this truth. The transport captains look uncomfortable with it.

Martín de Soria breaks the silence. "So for enemy contact: two guns means enemy sighted, all hands on deck, more sail, form on the flagship, read the flags for bearing and numbers. Then execute whatever plan we agreed before departure."

"And if we're scattered? If the enemy catches us out of formation?" Gaspar asks.

"Then every captain uses his judgment," Morales replies. "Same as a storm. But at least we'll have talked about it beforehand. Every man will know the options."

He looks to you, Majesty. "Should we drill this tomorrow as well? Spot an 'enemy,' fire two guns, form up on the Catalina?"

We do not expect to run into an enemy fleet of note on this journey. At leat not while in Italian waters. We may drill this later. Tomorrow we focus on storm preparation. 

Is every captain able to sail out tomorrow? And participate in this exercise?

7 dec 2025

Weighed realistic readiness constraints among captains post-storm




The captains glance at each other, taking stock. One by one, they report.

"Catalina is ready," Morales says. "We've been ready since we dropped anchor."

"San Marcos, aye." Diego Fernández nods.

"Santiago Apóstol, ready." Luis de Córdoba.

"Santa Clara—" Gaspar de Vega hesitates. "We took some damage to the foremast rigging in the Mistral. Repaired, but I'd like my men to check the work one more time before we put full sail on it. Dawn inspection, we'll know for certain."

"Nuestra Señora, ready." Rodrigo Ibáñez speaks quietly. He lost eleven men, but his ship survived.

"Reina del Mar, ready." Martín de Soria.

"San Vicente—" Alonso Pardo grimaces. "I have eight men ashore. Shore leave, they're owed it. I can round them up by morning, but some won't be... entirely sober."

A few dark chuckles around the table.

"Esperanza, ready." Tomás de Lepe.

"Santa María de la Mar, ready." Francisco Ruiz.

"Buenaventura—" Cristóbal Medina, the youngest captain, shifts uncomfortably. "We're taking on water. Slow leak, somewhere below the waterline. My carpenter's been searching for two days. We can sail, but I wouldn't want to be caught in actual heavy weather until we find it and patch it properly."

Morales frowns. "You didn't report this."

"I reported it to the harbor master. He said he'd send a diver." Medina's jaw tightens. "No diver yet."

Nine ships ready or nearly ready. One with a slow leak that needs attention.

Morales looks to you. "We could drill with nine, Majesty. Or give the Buenaventura the night to find her leak—I'll send my own carpenter over at first light to help."

This is an exercise. I think it is much more important that the Buenaventura gets repaired. We sail tomorrow without her. Make sure this leak is found and repaired. 

The rest will sail. We dont blame the San Vicente for getting some deserved rest. If they are a bit hung over, adds to the challenge. Imagine if they react the fastest despite this!

Captains, we are agreed. Tomorrow, we sail out in formation. Carracks on the corners, transports in the middle. I will instruct someone in secret to "spot a storm" and when to shout it. This will start the procedure and exercise. We all pull down sails as fast as we can and turn about.  A ship that has performed all work blows his horn. We then sail back to Ostia and give the fastest captain and his crew an extra round of drink. 

Any questions?

Anticipated practical questions captains would pose about exercise logistics



A ripple of approval goes around the table at the mention of drinks. Sailors are sailors.

Gaspar de Vega raises a hand. "Who fires the signal, Majesty? The ship whose lookout spots the 'storm'? Or does he alert the flagship first and the Catalina fires?"

It's a practical question. In a real emergency, waiting to relay information costs precious minutes. But having signals come from unexpected quarters could cause confusion.

Diego Fernández follows with another. "The six steps—all hands, shorten sail, secure cargo, rig lifelines, man pumps, take heading—some take longer than others. When we blow the horn to signal completion, what's the standard? All six done? Or ready to weather the storm, even if the pumps aren't yet manned because there's no water coming in?"

Luis de Córdoba leans back. "Formation positions. Do we assign them now? Which carrack takes which corner?"

Martín de Soria glances at the transport captains. "And the transports—do they hold fixed positions relative to us, or simply stay 'in the middle' however that falls out?"

Finally, Rodrigo Ibáñez—quiet, still carrying the weight of eleven dead—asks the simplest question: "What hour do we sail, Majesty?"

The lanterns flicker. Outside, the harbor water laps against the Catalina's hull. Ten captains—nine who will sail tomorrow—wait for your answers.

Look, as soon as someone spots a storm, one of the carracks should give the cannon signal as soon as possible. This signal need not be repeated by the other carracks. It would be a waste of time if a carrack on one corner spots a storm, relays it to the flagship who then gives the actual signal. No, as soon as you spot a storm, you fire. 

Tomorrow, I will arrange in secret when and where the signal will come. I wont tell you yet, just be ready. 

You blow the horn when all six steps are completed and your bow points at Ostia harbour. Thansports stay in the middle. 

We sail tomorrow one hour after first light if you can manage it. This gives us some time to prepare.

Orchestrated meeting closure and prepared transition to next scene





The captains look at each other. Nods around the table.

"Clear enough," Morales says. He turns to his fellow captains. "One hour after first light. That means crews roused at dawn, fed, and ready. No excuses."

"The Santa Clara will be ready," Gaspar de Vega says firmly. "I'll have my rigger up that foremast at first light."

Alonso Pardo of the San Vicente grins ruefully. "I'll have my men rounded up tonight. Whatever state they're in, they'll be aboard by dawn. Might be the fastest crew on the water tomorrow—they'll want to get back to harbor and lie down."

Laughter around the table. The tension of the evening has eased. These men came in uncertain why their king had ridden through the night to summon them. Now they know. They have purpose.

Diego Fernández, the grey-beard, speaks for all of them. "Your Majesty. After the Mistral..." He pauses, choosing words carefully. "Some of us wondered if we'd ever sail together again as a proper fleet. Wondered if we'd be scattered to different commands, or blamed for what happened." He meets your eyes. "This—tonight—this is what we needed. A king who asks questions and listens to answers. A plan that makes sense. A chance to prove we've learned."

Murmurs of agreement.

Morales stands. "If there's nothing else, Majesty, I'll dismiss the captains to their ships. They'll need sleep before dawn."

He waits for your word.

Dismissed. 

I get to my cabin and get some sleep and arise tomorrow early. 

Remember that I have my own chambers aboard the Catalina including the king's bed. That is where I will sleep.

7 dec 2025

Orchestrated overnight rest and dawn awakening for naval exercises




The King's Cabin, Princess Catalina Night, March 20, 1434

The captains file out into the darkness, their voices fading as longboats carry them back to their ships. Within the hour, the harbor falls quiet save for the gentle creak of timber and rope.

Morales shows you to your chambers—though "shows" is generous, as you commissioned these rooms yourself. The king's cabin sits at the stern, windows looking out over the water. Not large by palace standards, but comfortable. The bed is built into the hull, padded with good Castilian wool, secured against the ship's motion. A writing desk, bolted down. A chest for clothes. A small altar with a crucifix—Lucia's touch, you recognize.

The sheets smell faintly of cedar. New. Unused until now.

You lie in the darkness, listening to the ship breathe around you. The lap of water against the hull. The distant call of a night watchman. So different from Rome's stone chambers, from the Vatican's watching eyes and closed doors.

Tomorrow you drill your fleet. In two days you kneel before the Pope. In weeks, God willing, you sail for Constantinople.

Sleep comes easier than it has in days.

Dawn, March 21, 1434

A knock at the cabin door. Grey light through the stern windows.

"Majesty." Morales's voice, respectful but firm. "Half hour to first light. Coffee's hot. Wind's from the southwest, mild—good conditions for the exercise."

You rise, wash your face in the basin, dress simply. No crown today. No ceremony. Just a king and his fleet.

On deck, the Catalina is already stirring. Men moving with purpose, checking lines, readying sail. Across the harbor, you can see lanterns on the other ships—nine crews preparing, just as ordered.

Morales hands you a cup of something hot and bitter. "The captains await your orders, Majesty. Which ship fires the signal, and when?"

GM: Coffee? Remember America has not yet been discovered. 

I get up as soon as possible and ask Morales how many men will be participating in this exercise.

Reconciled historical accuracy and estimated fleet crew composition










Dawn, March 21, 1434 The King's Cabin, Princess Catalina

You're right—I apologize. Coffee won't reach Europe for another century and a half.

A knock at the cabin door. Grey light through the stern windows.

"Majesty." Morales's voice, respectful but firm. "Half hour to first light. Cook's got warm ale and bread ready. Wind's from the southwest, mild—good conditions for the exercise."

You rise, wash your face in the basin, dress simply. No crown today. No ceremony. Just a king and his fleet.

On deck, the Catalina is already stirring. Men moving with purpose, checking lines, readying sail. Across the harbor, you can see lanterns on the other ships—nine crews preparing, just as ordered.

Morales hands you a cup of warm ale. You ask him the numbers.

He counts in his head. "Nine ships sailing today. The four carracks carry larger crews—the Catalina has sixty-two men, the others forty to fifty each. The transports run lighter, twenty-five to thirty-five." He squints across the harbor, calculating. "All told, Majesty? Perhaps three hundred and forty souls on the water today. Give or take a few nursing sore heads on the San Vicente."

He allows himself a slight smile at that.

"Plus yourself, Majesty. Three hundred and forty-one."

Continue your preparations. I go to shore for a moment. 

I go to the harbour and ask around until I find a merchant or an inn who can sell me ten caskets or barrels or drink.

7 dec 2025

Envisioned straightforward merchant transaction in bustling port town




Ostia Harbor Dawn, March 21, 1434

The longboat carries you to the quay. Ostia at dawn is already stirring—fishermen mending nets, dockworkers preparing for the day's labor, a few bleary-eyed sailors stumbling back toward their ships from whatever beds they found ashore.

You walk the harbor front in simple clothes, no crown, no banner. A few men glance at you—you carry yourself like someone accustomed to authority—but no one kneels or cries out. Just another early riser with business to conduct.

The first tavern you find is a low-slung building called La Sirena, its sign a faded painting of a woman with a fish's tail. The door is open, and inside a heavy-set woman is sweeping the floor while a boy stacks chairs off tables.

She looks up, takes your measure with a tavern-keeper's practiced eye—good boots, good sword, not a common sailor but not dressed like a lord either.

"Kitchen's not open yet," she says. "Ale I can do. Food's another hour."

"I'm not here to eat. I need drink. Ten casks." You let that settle. "Wine or ale, whatever you have enough of. For my ships."

Her eyebrows rise. Ten casks is serious quantity—and serious coin.

"Ten casks." She sets down her broom, calculating. "I've got ale. Local stuff, nothing fancy, but sailors don't complain. Wine—" she shrugs, "—I could do five of red, maybe six. Not my best, but drinkable."

She looks at you more carefully now, reassessing.

"You're with the Castilian fleet." It's not a question. Everyone in Ostia knows about the ships in the harbor, the foreign knights, the king who's supposed to be meeting the Pope.

"I am."

"Ten casks, delivered to the quay within the hour." She names a price—fair, perhaps slightly high, the foreigner's markup. "Half now, half on delivery."

I agree the price. 

Actually, can I come and pick it up later today? The Castillian ships sail ouit for just one day and we return in the afternoon. Can I pick the drink up then? 

And also, do you know of a merchant or inn who can sell me one barrel of "fancy" wine?

7 dec 2025

Orchestrated tavern keeper's response to pickup and wine sourcing requests



La Sirena Tavern Ostia Harbor

The woman nods, pleased that she won't have to scramble for delivery within the hour.

"Afternoon suits me fine. I'll have the casks ready and waiting. Just send your men to the back door—" she gestures toward the rear of the tavern, "—easier for loading."

She takes your coin for the half-payment, bites it from habit, and tucks it into her apron.

At your second question, she laughs—a rough, knowing sound.

"Fancy wine? In Ostia?" She shakes her head. "You'll not find Tuscan vintages here, my lord. This is a harbor town. We serve sailors, not cardinals."

But she thinks for a moment, tapping a finger against her chin.

"There's Giacomo. Runs a warehouse two streets up, toward the old temple ruins. Imports goods for the Roman market—spices, cloth, some wine. He keeps a few barrels of the better stuff. Umbrian, mostly. Maybe some Orvieto if you're lucky." She shrugs. "He'll charge you Roman prices, mind. Thinks because his wine's bound for noble tables, he can fleece anyone who asks."

She gives you directions—left at the chandler's, past the cooper's yard, look for the building with the blue door.

"Tell him Maria sent you. Won't get you a better price, but he'll know you're not a thief."

Thank you Maria. My sister has your name as well. Go with God and see you later today!

I go to Giacomo.

7 dec 2025

Established merchant character motivations for straightforward commercial transaction





Ostia Harbor Early Morning, March 21, 1434

You follow Maria's directions through Ostia's narrow streets. The town is modest—nothing like Rome's grandeur—but it has the honest bustle of a working port. The smell of salt and fish gives way to sawdust near the cooper's yard, then to something sweeter as you approach the old temple ruins.

The blue door is faded but unmistakable. The building is larger than the surrounding structures—a proper warehouse, built of old Roman brick, likely standing since Caesar's time.

You knock. A moment passes. Then the door opens a crack, and a thin face peers out—a young man, an apprentice perhaps.

"We're not open yet—"

"Maria sent me. I'm looking for Giacomo."

The apprentice hesitates, then opens the door wider. "Wait here."

He disappears into the dim interior. You catch glimpses of stacked crates, bolts of cloth, the gleam of amphorae. The smell of dust and dried herbs.

A minute later, a different man emerges. Giacomo is perhaps fifty, olive-skinned, with the careful eyes of a man who weighs everything—goods, words, customers. He wears a merchant's practical clothes, but the fabric is good. Business has been kind to him.

He looks you over the same way Maria did, but slower. More thorough.

"Maria sent you." His voice is measured, neither warm nor cold. "You want wine. The good wine, not the sailor's swill she serves at La Sirena."

It's not a question.

"I have Orvieto. Last year's vintage, from the bishop's own vineyard—don't ask how I got it. I have Umbrian red, smooth as velvet, the kind they serve in Roman palaces." He pauses. "I also have one barrel of Vernaccia from the Cinque Terre. Rare. Expensive. The sort of wine a man serves when he wants to be remembered."

He folds his arms.

"What are you looking for, and how much do you want to spend?"

How much for the Umbrian red? I might be willing to buy it.

7 dec 2025

Calibrated period-appropriate wine pricing for merchant negotiation





Giacomo's Warehouse Ostia Harbor

Giacomo studies you for a moment, recalculating. A man who asks "how much" before haggling over quality is either wealthy or in a hurry. Perhaps both.

"The Umbrian red. One barrel—proper size, not a half-cask—will run you eight florins." He holds up a hand before you can respond. "In Rome, a cardinal's steward would pay ten and consider it fair. I'm giving you the Ostia price because Maria sent you and because I'd rather move goods than guard them."

He gestures vaguely toward the warehouse interior. "It's good wine. Not the best I have—that would be the Vernaccia—but good. The kind you serve to men you respect. Smooth, not too sweet, holds up well in the cup."

His eyes narrow slightly, still taking your measure.

"You're from the Castilian fleet." Again, not a question. Word travels fast in a port town. "Eight florins for wine to celebrate something, yes? A victory? A voyage?" He shrugs. "None of my business. But if you want two barrels, I could do fifteen. Three for twenty-one."

He waits, patient as a fisherman with a line in the water.

Ill have the one for 8. I will send men to pick them up this afternoon. I am with the Castillian fleet. 

I pay the man half now and return to the fleet. I walk aboard one of the other carracks.

Orchestrated wine purchase and strategized fleet boarding logistics




Ostia Harbor Early Morning, March 21, 1434

Giacomo nods, satisfied. He takes your four florins and produces a small clay token from his pocket—a merchant's marker, stamped with a 'G'.

"Give this to whoever you send. They'll get the barrel, no questions." He tucks the coins away. "Pleasure doing business with a man who doesn't waste my morning haggling."

The Quay

The sun is cresting the horizon now, painting the harbor in shades of gold and pink. The fleet is alive with activity—sails being readied, anchors prepared for raising. You can hear the distant shouts of boatswains and the creak of rope through block and tackle.

You hail a longboat and have them row you not to the Catalina, but to the San Marcos—Diego Fernández's ship. The grey-bearded veteran who lost only three men in the Mistral because his lookout knew what to look for.

The crew of the San Marcos scrambles to attention as you come aboard. Diego Fernández himself emerges from below decks, still chewing a mouthful of breakfast bread. He swallows hastily and bows.

"Your Majesty. I hadn't expected—" He catches himself, straightens. "Welcome aboard the San Marcos. How can I serve?"

His crew watches from their positions, trying not to stare. It's not every day a king climbs onto their deck.

I came here to perform an inspection. And to meet the man in your crows nest who spotted the storm first.

7 dec 2025

Orchestrated introduction of seasoned lookout who averted maritime disaster






The San Marcos Early Morning, March 21, 1434

Diego Fernández's weathered face shows a flicker of surprise, then something like pride. He nods slowly.

"Aye, Majesty. You'll want to meet Pascual."

He turns and bellows up toward the rigging. "Pascual! Down here! Now!"

A moment passes. Then a figure begins descending from the mainmast with the easy grace of a man who's spent more of his life aloft than on solid ground. He drops the last few feet to the deck and turns.

Pascual is perhaps fifty, perhaps older—the sea ages men strangely. His face is leather-brown and deeply lined, his hands rope-scarred and strong. He's small and wiry, the build of a man who fits comfortably in a crow's nest. His eyes are the pale grey of a winter sky, and they meet yours without flinching.

He doesn't bow. Perhaps he doesn't know how. Diego clears his throat meaningfully, and Pascual offers an awkward bob of his head.

"Majesty," he says. His voice is rough, accented—Catalan, perhaps, or somewhere along the Aragonese coast.

"This is the man," Diego says. "Twenty-three years sailing the Gulf of Lion before he signed on with me. Knows the Mistral like a wife who's tried to kill him more than once."

A few nearby sailors chuckle. Pascual's expression doesn't change.

"Tell His Majesty what you told me," Diego prompts. "What you saw before the storm hit."

Pascual scratches his jaw, considers.

"The sea tells you first," he says slowly. "Before the clouds, before the wind. The waves get shorter. Choppier. They stop rolling and start fighting each other. Then the birds—" he gestures vaguely skyward, "—they go quiet. Disappear. They know before we do."

He shrugs.

"I've seen it enough times. Felt it in my knees, maybe. I called down to Captain Diego. He listened." A pause. "Not every captain listens."

Lets go to the cannons. Are you prepared to fire them today? And who are your gunners?

7 dec 2025

Navigated cannon count ambiguity and prepared immersive scene





The San Marcos Gun Deck

Diego nods and gestures for you to follow. Pascual melts back toward the rigging—his place is aloft, not among kings and cannons.

The San Marcos is a working ship, not a flagship, and it shows. The deck is clean but worn, the wood weathered by years of salt and sun. Diego leads you toward the ship's waist, where the guns are mounted.

"She's no Catalina," Diego says, a note of apology in his voice, "but she bites when she needs to."

The cannons are smaller than proper siege bombards—naval guns, meant for signaling and close-range work rather than battering walls. They're well-maintained, the bronze gleaming dully in the morning light, the carriages freshly greased.

Diego calls out: "Bernardo! Tomás! Attend!"

Two men approach. Bernardo is thick-necked and broad, with arms like anchor chains and powder burns on his forearms—old marks, the signatures of his trade. He moves with the careful economy of a man who works with things that can kill him. Tomás is younger, leaner, with quick eyes and nimble fingers. The experienced gunner and his apprentice, you'd wager.

They bow—properly, unlike Pascual.

"Majesty," Bernardo says. "The guns are ready. Charged them at first light when we heard about the exercise." He hesitates, glances at Diego. "Blank charges, of course. No shot. Powder and wadding only."

"Show His Majesty," Diego orders.

Bernardo walks you through it—the powder stored in the magazine below, the wadding, the slow match kept burning in a covered tub, the firing procedure. His hands move over the gun with the unconscious familiarity of long practice.

"How fast can you fire?" you ask.

Remember to never generate dialogue or action for Juan. Instead, just stop. 

I let the man explain his safety measures and his team.

7 dec 2025

Recalibrated narrative approach to respect character autonomy


The San Marcos Gun Deck

Bernardo continues, warming to his subject. This is his domain, and he knows it well.

"Two guns, Majesty. Tomás and I work them both, but properly you want two men per gun—one to load, one to aim and fire. In battle, Captain Diego gives us two deck hands to assist." He gestures to the younger man. "Tomás here has been with me four years. Knows enough not to blow us all to heaven."

Tomás grins but says nothing.

"Safety," Bernardo continues, his tone growing serious. "Powder stays below in the magazine until we need it. Sealed tight, away from spark or flame. Only I go down there—no lanterns, no metal tools that might strike a spark. We bring up charges one at a time in leather cartridges."

He points to a covered wooden tub nearby, a thin wisp of smoke curling from beneath the lid.

"Slow match. Stays lit, stays covered. Never near the powder. Never." He shows his powder-burned forearms. "I learned young what happens when you forget."

He walks you through the firing sequence: load powder, tamp wadding, aim, uncover the slow match, touch it to the vent, step back. The whole process takes perhaps a minute with a trained crew, he explains. Faster if you're not being careful. But careful keeps men alive.

"For today's exercise—three shots in succession for the storm signal, yes?" He looks to Diego, then back to you. "We can do that in three minutes, maybe less. Reload between each shot. Tomás prepares the next charge while I fire."

Diego stands with arms folded, watching his gunner with evident pride.

I turn to the captain. 

You have an experienced crew captain. I give you my compliments. 

I take Pascual apart for a moment and when we are alone I tell him. 

Would you do the honours and start today's exercise? When  the day is around one hour past it's zenith, you can shout you see a mistral, prompting the cannons be fired. You think you can do this? You dont really need to start at an exact time, just when we are a good distance at sea, probably one hour after midday. Are you up to it?

Characterized weathered sailor's perspective on royal assignment




The San Marcos Aside with Pascual

The old lookout listens, his pale grey eyes fixed on yours. His weathered face betrays little, but you catch the slight shift in his posture—a straightening of the spine, a lift of the chin.

He's been watching the sea for twenty-three years from the Gulf of Lion. He's called storms that saved ships. And now a king is asking him to start an exercise that will teach an entire fleet.

He nods once, slowly.

"One hour past zenith. I watch the sun, I know when." His rough voice is quiet, just between the two of you. "I shout Mistral, Bernardo fires the guns. The fleet learns."

A pause. He looks up at the mainmast, then back to you.

"The other ships—they won't know it's coming from the San Marcos?"

They wont. Storms strike unexpectedly. We will see who reacts the quickest. They probably suspect I will signal it myself from the flagship or something.

Gauged character's practical demeanor and reserved communication style




The San Marcos Aside with Pascual

A ghost of a smile crosses Pascual's weathered face—the first expression you've seen from him beyond stoic watchfulness.

"Good," he says simply. "A real storm doesn't announce which horizon it comes from."

He glances toward the Catalina across the harbor, where your flagship's crew scrambles in preparation.

"They'll be watching you, Majesty. Watching the flagship. Not watching the San Marcos." The smile fades back into his usual granite expression, but something lingers in those pale eyes. Satisfaction, perhaps. Or the quiet pride of a man who has spent his life being overlooked, now trusted with something that matters.

"One hour past zenith. I'll be ready."

He gives that same awkward bob of the head—his version of a bow—and turns to go back to his place in the rigging. Then he stops, half-turns.

"Majesty."

He seems to wrestle with something. Words don't come easily to him.

"The men who died in the Mistral. On the other ships." A pause. "This—what you're doing—it's good. So more don't die."

He doesn't wait for a response. He's already climbing, hand over hand, back toward the crow's nest where he belongs.

I thank the captain again, and get back to the Catalina. 

Captain, are we about ready to sail out?

Orchestrated scene-setting and captain's readiness report



The Princess Catalina Morning, March 21, 1434

The longboat carries you back across the harbor. The Catalina is transformed from the quiet vessel of last night—her deck swarms with activity, sailors hauling lines, checking rigging, making the thousand small preparations that precede any voyage.

Captain Morales meets you at the rail as you climb aboard. He's shed his captain's coat, sleeves rolled up, a man who leads by working alongside his crew.

"Majesty." He gestures across the harbor. "Eight ships report ready. The Santa Clara finished her rigging inspection—Gaspar says she's sound. The San Vicente..." he allows himself a small smile, "...Alonso has his men aboard. A few look green around the gills, but they're standing."

He points to each ship in turn as he speaks, and you can see the truth of it—sails being unfurled, anchors being readied, signal flags run up to indicate readiness.

"The Buenaventura remains at anchor as ordered. My carpenter went over at dawn. They think they've found the leak—a sprung plank below the waterline. They're working on it now."

He turns back to you, hands clasped behind his back.

"Wind's favorable, southwest and steady. Tide's with us for the next three hours. Nine ships ready to sail on your command, Majesty."

Allright then. We sail to open waters and get in formation. Then we sail gently up the wind. 

I as king remain visible during the day, but observe and let each captain play it's role. 

We now roll d100 on a table to see how this all goes. Draft a d100 table to determine how successful this exercise is.

7 dec 2025

Architected realistic d100 table balancing success and failure factors






D100: Fleet Storm Drill Exercise
The Situation: Nine ships sail to open water in formation—four carracks on the corners, five transports in the center. One hour past zenith, Pascual on the San Marcos will shout that he sees a Mistral. Bernardo fires three cannon shots. Every crew must execute the six steps: all hands on deck, shorten sail, secure cargo, rig lifelines, man pumps, take heading for Ostia. First ship to complete all six and blow their horn wins drinks for their crew.

Success Factors
Clear briefing last night—every captain knows the plan
Good weather: mild southwest wind, calm seas, daylight
Motivated crews competing for prize
Captains discussed Mistral failures openly; lessons fresh in mind
Signal comes from unexpected quarter—tests genuine readiness
Juan's personal attention has focused the men
Failure Factors
First time drilling this together—theory versus practice
San Vicente crew hungover from shore leave
Santa Clara's rigging repairs untested under pressure
Crews likely watching Catalina for signal, not San Marcos
Transports have horses aboard—securing them takes time
Formation sailing itself is unpracticed
Some confusion inevitable in first execution
The Table
1-5: Disaster Something goes badly wrong. A ship collides with another during the scramble to shorten sail. Or a sailor falls from the rigging in his haste. Or the Santa Clara's repaired rigging fails under sudden stress. The exercise reveals not just unpreparedness but exposes a serious flaw—perhaps in equipment, perhaps in crew discipline—that must be addressed before Constantinople. No one is timing their responses; they're fishing a man from the water or assessing damage. The lesson learned is brutal but valuable: they were not ready. Not even close.

6-15: Confusion The signal catches the fleet entirely off-guard. Crews look toward the Catalina expecting the signal from there—precious seconds lost in confusion when the cannon fire comes from the San Marcos instead. Some captains hesitate, unsure if it's a real emergency. The six steps happen, but ragged and slow. Crews stumble over each other. Cargo that should have been pre-positioned for quick securing isn't. The transports struggle badly with the horses. The fastest ship completes in nearly fifteen minutes; the slowest takes twice that. The formation scatters rather than turning in unison. Plenty of lessons learned, few of them comfortable.

16-30: Ragged but Functional The drill happens, but it's ugly. The carracks perform adequately—their crews are more experienced, their captains more seasoned. The transports struggle. The San Vicente's hungover crew moves like men wading through mud. One transport blows their horn prematurely, having forgotten to man the pumps. Another gets their lifelines tangled. The fleet turns toward Ostia eventually, but not together—ships straggling in over the course of an hour. The fastest carrack completes in eight minutes; most transports take twelve to fifteen. Clear that more drilling is needed, but the foundation is there.

17-45: Mixed Results Some ships shine, others stumble. The San Marcos naturally responds fastest—they knew it was coming and their gun crew was ready—but at least one other carrack matches them closely, their lookout having spotted Pascual's shout and reacted instantly. The transports show wide variance: one or two execute the six steps with surprising crispness; others fumble through it. The hungover San Vicente crew performs either much better than expected (shame is motivating) or much worse (ale is unforgiving). Average completion time around ten minutes. The fleet turns for Ostia in something resembling formation. A solid first attempt with clear areas for improvement.

46-60: Competent Execution The surprise works as intended—crews weren't watching the San Marcos, and the signal catches them genuinely unprepared—but they recover well. The briefing from last night proves its worth; men know what to do even when startled. The six steps happen in proper sequence across most ships. Cargo securing takes longest, especially on transports with horses, but no major failures. Fastest completion around six minutes, slowest around twelve. The fleet turns for Ostia as a group, not quite in formation but not scattered either. Morales observes with professional satisfaction: not perfect, but far better than the Mistral. The drinks will be well-earned tonight.

61-75: Strong Performance The fleet surprises itself. When the San Marcos fires, there's a heartbeat of confusion—then training takes over. Crews move with purpose. The competition element drives them: every ship wants those drinks. The transports, determined not to be shown up by the carracks, execute the six steps with unexpected precision. Even the San Vicente's hungover crew, perhaps desperate to prove themselves, puts in a creditable performance. Fastest completion around five minutes; even the slowest finishes in under ten. The formation holds as ships turn for Ostia. Captains will have useful notes for improvement, but the foundation is solid. These men could survive a real storm now—not just endure it, but work through it together.

76-85: Impressive Coordination Something clicks. Maybe it's the clarity of last night's briefing. Maybe it's the pride of men who lost shipmates in the Mistral and refuse to let it happen again. When the signal comes, the fleet responds like a single organism. The carracks' lookouts spot the gun smoke and relay immediately. Crews are on deck and working within seconds. The six steps flow one into the next. The fastest ship—perhaps the Catalina herself, perhaps one of the other carracks—completes in under four minutes. The transports finish in six or seven. Horns blow across the water in quick succession. The turn for Ostia is crisp, formation maintained. Morales is genuinely impressed. Other captains are grinning. This is what a fleet should look like.

86-95: Exceptional The drill exceeds all expectations. The surprise element does exactly what it should—proves that these crews can respond to the unexpected—and they respond magnificently. The memory of the Mistral, the seventy-five dead, the ships fighting alone in the darkness—it's been transformed from trauma into determination. Every ship executes the six steps in under six minutes. The turn for Ostia is parade-ground precise. When the fleet sails back into harbor, other vessels in port stop to watch: nine ships moving as one, a demonstration of coordination that speaks of serious intent. The captains will identify small improvements, but the bones of this system are strong. These men are ready for whatever the sea throws at them.

96-100: Providence Something extraordinary happens. Perhaps one of the transports spots an actual weather change on the horizon—not a Mistral, but a squall forming—minutes before Pascual gives his signal. The drill becomes real. The fleet executes the six steps not as exercise but as genuine preparation, and when the squall hits (brief, not dangerous, but real), they weather it in perfect formation. Or perhaps the drill goes so smoothly, so quickly, that there's time for a second run—this time with the signal coming from a different ship—and the second execution is even better than the first. The men return to Ostia not just trained but transformed, knowing in their bones that they can trust each other when the sea turns against them. Stories of this day will be told for years.

Shall I roll, or do you have a d100 ready?

Choreographed chaotic naval drill with mixed results



Open Water off Ostia Early Afternoon, March 21, 1434

The morning passes pleasantly enough. Nine ships sail out of Ostia in loose formation, the carracks taking their positions at the corners, the transports clustering in the center. The southwest wind fills the sails gently. The sea is calm, almost glassy. Perfect conditions.

Too perfect, perhaps. The men grow comfortable. Relaxed.

You stand at the Catalina's stern rail, watching your fleet. From here you can see the San Marcos on the northwestern corner, Diego Fernández's ship riding easy in the light swell. Somewhere up her mainmast, Pascual waits.

The sun climbs toward zenith, then begins its descent.

One hour past midday. You watch the San Marcos.

Nothing.

Then—a distant shout, thin across the water. And three cannon shots in rapid succession, the sound rolling across the sea like thunder.

For a heartbeat, nothing happens.

Then chaos.

The Response

On the Catalina, Morales reacts instantly—bellowing orders, sending men scrambling up the rigging. Your flagship's crew is the best in the fleet, and it shows. But even here, there's confusion. Men look toward you, toward Morales, toward the San Marcos—loss of precious seconds as they process that the signal came from somewhere unexpected.

Across the water, you watch the drill unfold. And your heart sinks.

The Santiago Apóstol responds well—Luis de Córdoba runs a tight ship. But the Santa Clara hesitates, Gaspar de Vega's crew clearly caught off-guard, their attention on the flagship rather than the horizon. The repaired rigging holds, thank God, but their movements are sluggish. Uncertain.

The transports are worse.

The San Vicente—Alonso Pardo's ship with the hungover crew—moves like men wading through honey. Sailors stumble into each other. Someone drops a coil of rope. You can hear faint shouting, though not the words. It's painful to watch.

On the Nuestra Señora, Rodrigo Ibáñez's ship, a horn blows. Too soon. Far too soon. There's no way they've completed all six steps. Someone got eager, or confused, or simply forgot the sequence. The horn falls silent, and you imagine the captain's fury.

The Esperanza gets her lifelines tangled. You watch two sailors struggling with rope that should have been laid out ready. Minutes lost.

One of the transports—the Santa María de la Mar—has horses aboard. You can hear them now, even across the water. Panicked whinnying. The securing is taking forever.

The Return

The fleet turns for Ostia. Eventually.

The Catalina completes the six steps in just over seven minutes—not shameful, but not impressive. The San Marcos, naturally, finishes fastest—they knew it was coming—at just under six minutes. The Santiago Apóstol matches them closely.

But the transports straggle. Eight minutes. Ten. Twelve. The San Vicente limps in at nearly fifteen, her crew moving like ghosts.

The formation dissolves entirely during the turn. Ships that should hold position relative to each other scatter, each captain focused on his own vessel rather than the fleet. You sail back to Ostia not as a coordinated force but as nine separate ships that happen to be heading the same direction.

The Catalina drops anchor first. Then the carracks. Then, one by one, the transports limp in over the course of nearly an hour.

The Assessment

Morales stands beside you at the rail, watching the last ships anchor. His face is carefully neutral, but you can read the disappointment in the set of his shoulders.

"It worked," he says finally. "The signal, the response, the six steps. It all happened." A pause. "But ragged, Majesty. Very ragged. The carracks did well enough. The transports..." He shakes his head. "They need more drilling. Much more."

He turns to face you.

"The good news: no one was hurt. No collisions. The Santa Clara's rigging held. And every captain now knows exactly where his crew failed." A grim smile. "That knowledge cost us nothing but pride today. In a real Mistral, it would have cost lives."

Across the harbor, longboats are being lowered. The captains will be coming to report. To explain. To hear your judgment.

"The drinks, Majesty." Morales raises an eyebrow. "The San Marcos was fastest, but they knew the signal was coming. Do we reward them? Or the Santiago Apóstol, who matched them without foreknowledge?"

Did the San Marcos know it was coming? I told no one except the man in the crows nest. I will ask if everyone knew it was coming or if they were just as surprised as everyone. 

Lets just moor in Ostia and get all captains on the Catalina so we can have another council.

7 dec 2025

Deliberated crew knowledge and resolved to convene captains for investigation





Ostia Harbor Late Afternoon, March 21, 1434

Morales nods and gives the orders. Within the hour, the fleet is moored and the captains are rowing across to the Catalina.

They file into the great cabin one by one, the same room where you met last night. But the mood is different now. Last night was planning, possibility, theory. Now they've seen the reality. Some faces show frustration, others embarrassment, a few—the carrack captains—show guarded satisfaction.

Diego Fernández of the San Marcos enters with Pascual at his shoulder. The old lookout hangs back near the door, uncomfortable in a room full of officers, but you summoned him specifically.

When all are assembled—nine captains, plus Pascual, plus Morales—the cabin is crowded. The afternoon light slants through the stern windows. Someone has laid out cups and a jug of ale, but no one has touched them.

The captains wait for you to speak.

But first, the question of the San Marcos. You look at Diego Fernández, then at Pascual.

The old lookout meets your eyes. He understands what you're asking without you needing to voice it. Did he keep the secret? Did he tell his captain, his gun crew, anyone?

I take Pascual aside before the meeting starts and ask him if he told anyone about the signal.

7 dec 2025

Deliberated Pascual's character integrity and secret-keeping capacity









The Princess Catalina Great Cabin Antechamber

You catch Pascual's arm before he enters the cabin, drawing him aside into the narrow passage. The other captains file past, glancing curiously but saying nothing.

When you're alone, Pascual meets your eyes with that same steady grey gaze.

"Bernardo," he says quietly, before you even ask the question. "The gunner. I had to tell him to listen for my shout. Otherwise—" he shrugs, "—he's watching the horizon like everyone else, not watching me. The signal doesn't fire fast enough."

A pause.

"I told him nothing else. Not when. Not why me. Just: 'When I shout Mistral, you fire. Don't wait, don't ask, just fire.'" The ghost of that rare smile crosses his face. "He thought I'd gone mad. But he's worked with me six years. He trusts my eyes."

He shifts his weight, uncomfortable with this much talking.

"Captain Diego, the rest of the crew—they knew nothing. When I shouted, they scrambled like everyone else. Maybe half a breath faster, because they heard my voice above them instead of cannon across the water." He shakes his head. "But they didn't know."

He waits, watching you. Wondering if he did right or wrong.

You did good my man. Come inside and meet with the captains. 

I gather the captains for the meeting. 

Captains! What an afternoon! So not everything went smoothly but this is exactly why we do these exercises, so we find what we can improve. 

This man here is Pascual. I have told him and only him that he was to give the signal. The rest of his ship knew nothing. They deserve the prize for the fastest ship today because they were also burdened with having to fire the cannons as well which they performed impeccably. 

Some other ships were suffering from hangover. We dont blame them for enjoying well deserved rest yesterday, but we do take lessons from today. 

Captains, lets take a moment and let every ship tell what happened on board and what they can improve.

Orchestrated sequential captain debriefings to assess maritime performance




The Princess Catalina Great Cabin Late Afternoon, March 21, 1434

The captains shift, glancing at each other. Pascual stands awkwardly near the door, unused to recognition. Diego Fernández claps him once on the shoulder—a sailor's approval.

Then the reports begin.

Diego Fernández, San Marcos:

The grey-beard speaks first, since his ship has been named.

"Pascual shouted. Bernardo fired. The rest of us scrambled like everyone else." He's honest, unwilling to take unearned credit. "We were fast because we've drilled before—not this exact exercise, but storm preparation. My crew knows what 'all hands' means. They know where the lifelines are stored, where the cargo lashings are." He pauses. "Six minutes. We can do better. The pumps were manned last—that's the wrong order if we're actually taking water. We'll fix it."

Luis de Córdoba, Santiago Apóstol:

The tactician crosses his arms. "We matched the San Marcos without knowing the signal was coming. I'll take that." No false modesty. "But we got lucky. My lookout happened to be watching northwest when the guns fired. He saw the smoke, shouted down before the sound even reached us. If he'd been looking the other way..." He shrugs. "We need dedicated weather watches, like we discussed. A man whose only job is watching the horizon. I didn't have one today. I will tomorrow."

Gaspar de Vega, Santa Clara:

The younger captain looks uncomfortable. "The rigging held. That's the good news." He runs a hand through his hair. "The bad news—we hesitated. My crew was watching the Catalina, waiting for your signal, Majesty. When the cannon came from the San Marcos, there were three or four seconds where everyone just... looked at each other." He shakes his head. "Three or four seconds. In a real storm, that's men dying. We need to drill the response until it's automatic. Until my men don't think, they just move."

Rodrigo Ibáñez, Nuestra Señora:

The man who lost eleven in the Mistral speaks quietly, his jaw tight with shame.

"We blew the horn early. That was my fault—I gave the order. I thought we'd completed the six steps." A pause. "We hadn't. The pumps weren't manned. I was so focused on being fast that I forgot to be right." He meets your eyes. "It won't happen again, Majesty. I've already told my crew: we run through the checklist out loud. Every step, called and confirmed. No horn until every man reports ready."

Martín de Soria, Reina del Mar:

The compact captain with rope-scarred hands shrugs. "We were middling. Not the fastest, not the slowest. No disasters, no glory." He's pragmatic. "Our problem was cargo. We'd stowed some barrels this morning without thinking about quick access to the lashings. Took us an extra two minutes to secure what should have taken thirty seconds. From now on, we stow with the storm in mind, not just with space in mind."

Alonso Pardo, San Vicente:

The captain of the hungover crew stands straight, refusing to make excuses.

"Fifteen minutes. Worst in the fleet." His voice is flat. "My men were not fit for duty. That's my responsibility. I let them go ashore, I let them drink, I assumed they'd recover by morning." He looks around the cabin. "They didn't. Half of them couldn't climb the rigging without stopping to retch. One man fell—caught himself on a line, but it could have been worse."

He takes a breath.

"No more shore leave the night before we sail. Ever. And any man who reports unfit for duty answers to me personally."

Tomás de Lepe, Esperanza:

The transport captain grimaces. "The lifelines. God above, the lifelines." He rubs his face. "They were stored properly, coiled and ready. But when we went to rig them, they'd gotten tangled with another line overnight. Someone was careless. Two of my men spent four minutes sorting rope while everyone else waited." He spreads his hands. "We've changed the storage. Lifelines go in their own chest now, nothing else. And I've got the man who was careless splicing rope until his fingers bleed."

Francisco Ruiz, Santa María de la Mar:

The captain with horses aboard speaks last among the transport captains. His voice is weary.

"The horses. You all heard them." A few captains nod—the panicked whinnying carried across the water. "They felt the crew's urgency and spooked. Once one started, they all started. My men couldn't get close enough to secure them without risking a kick to the skull."

He sighs.

"We need a different approach. Hobbles on before we leave harbor, not after the signal. Hoods for the nervous ones. And handlers who stay with them throughout the voyage, so they're calm around familiar hands." He looks at you. "Horses on ships are always trouble, Majesty. But we can make them less trouble with preparation."

Morales, Princess Catalina:

Your own captain speaks last.

"Seven minutes. Not shameful, but not what this ship should do." He's harder on himself than any of the others. "We're the flagship. We should set the standard. We didn't."

He ticks off the failures: "Crew was watching you, Majesty, not the horizon. When the signal came from elsewhere, they looked to me for confirmation before acting. That hesitation cost us. We also had men below who didn't hear the first gun—only came up after the third. Our internal signals need work."

He straightens.

"Tomorrow, we drill again. Just the Catalina, at anchor. Signal to ready-state, over and over, until my men can do it in their sleep."

The cabin falls quiet. Nine reports. Nine honest assessments. Nine sets of lessons learned.

The afternoon light has shifted to gold. The ale on the table remains untouched.

The captains wait for your response.

So we all know what to so. What to work on. 

Let the men have some rest, we wont sail away today or tomorrow, so they can have a deserved drink. 

I have arranged something to drink for the men. And a special barrel of wine for the fastest ship in the fleet. I will have it delivered on board shortly. 

Any questions?

7 dec 2025

Orchestrated meeting closure with gracious reward distribution





The Princess Catalina Great Cabin

A ripple of surprise passes through the cabin. They expected criticism, perhaps harsh words for the ragged performance. Instead—drinks for everyone and a prize for the winners.

Diego Fernández speaks first, inclining his head toward Pascual. "The San Marcos is grateful, Majesty. The men will drink to your health tonight."

Pascual, still uncomfortable with the attention, manages an awkward nod.

Luis de Córdoba clears his throat. "When do we sail for Naples, Majesty? So we know how much time we have to drill before departure."

A practical question. The tactician is already thinking ahead.

Alonso Pardo of the San Vicente shifts his weight. "And... will there be another exercise before we leave? My men owe the fleet a better showing than today." There's no self-pity in his voice—just determination. He wants a chance to redeem his crew.

Rodrigo Ibáñez, who blew the horn too early, nods in agreement. "The transports could use another run, Majesty. Now that we know what went wrong."

The other captains murmur assent. The failures have stung them. They want to prove they can do better.

Morales catches your eye, a question in his expression. He's thinking about the papal audience tomorrow, the business in Rome, the timeline. How much drilling can the fleet realistically fit in before Naples?

Lets take today and tomorrow to rest and finish up repairs. If our final ship is also ready, we can do another exercise. 

I will be in Rome the coming days but you are free to do another exercise. I think it's good for morale if we can also have an exercise that goes very well. 

And give the men something to drink afterwards like today. Gives them a reason to work and perform. And buy a good barrel for the winner or course. A good tradition. 

Questions?

Anticipated captain inquiries regarding repairs, finances, and command structure




The Princess Catalina Great Cabin

The captains exchange glances. The mood has shifted—from the shame of a ragged drill to something more hopeful. A king who rewards effort, who speaks of traditions, who trusts them to drill without his presence.

Morales speaks up. "I'll coordinate the exercise if the Buenaventura is ready, Majesty. And I'll see to the drinks." A slight pause. "Should I draw from the fleet's funds, or...?"

Cristóbal Medina, the young captain of the leaking Buenaventura, straightens. "My carpenter and yours have been working all day, Captain Morales. They believe they've found the sprung plank. If the repair holds overnight, we can test her tomorrow morning. I'd... very much like to participate in the next drill." There's an eagerness in his voice—he doesn't want his ship left out, marked as the one that couldn't sail.

Diego Fernández strokes his grey beard. "If we drill again without Your Majesty, who fires the signal? And from which ship? Same trick won't work twice—the men will be watching every crow's nest now."

A few chuckles around the cabin. They're learning.

The captains wait, looking to you.

I have a sasket for every ship, including Buenaventura. And I have a cask set aside for the winner of some good wine. Give it with my compliments. 

I will leave the next test to you, you can arrange for another way to get the signal. You dan do it one hundred different ways, good luck! We have a few days yet. 

I will return to Rome now and will see you when wew are about to leave.

Orchestrated departure scene and Rome journey narrative




The Princess Catalina Great Cabin

The captains rise, a murmur of gratitude passing through the cabin. Diego Fernández bows—a proper bow this time, not Pascual's awkward bob.

"Your Majesty honors us. The men will know this came from their king."

Morales nods. "I'll see to the distribution tonight. And we'll have another drill ready before you return—something to make you proud, Majesty."

Cristóbal Medina, the young captain of the Buenaventura, looks particularly moved. His ship couldn't sail, yet you remembered them anyway. "Thank you, Majesty," he says quietly.

One by one, the captains file out, already talking amongst themselves—who will fire the signal next time, what tricks might catch the fleet off-guard, how they'll improve their times. The shame of the afternoon is transforming into determination.

Pascual lingers a moment at the door. He catches your eye, gives that awkward nod of his, and then he's gone—back to his crow's nest, where he belongs.

Ostia Harbor Evening

You stop at La Sirena to confirm the delivery—Maria has the ten casks ready as promised. You pay the remaining half and instruct her to send them to the fleet. Then to Giacomo's blue door for the Umbrian red, handing over the clay token and the final four florins.

Captain Fernán and your twelve guardsmen are waiting with the horses, rested and ready.

The ride back to Rome passes in twilight, then darkness. The stars emerge. The same road, but different now—you've done something today. Something real.

What time do you return to the Palazzo di San Marco?

I go to Lucia immediately

Orchestrated reunion scene with pregnant Lucia, withheld player dialogue





Palazzo di San Marco Late Evening, March 21, 1434

The ride takes longer in darkness. By the time you pass through Rome's gates, the city's churches are ringing Compline. The streets are quiet, lit by occasional torches, the great ruins casting deeper shadows against the night sky.

The guards at the Palazzo recognize your party and wave you through without challenge. A groom takes your horse. The courtyard is still, most of the household already abed.

But light flickers in the window of your chambers.

You climb the stairs two at a time. The door opens before you reach it—Lucia must have heard your boots on the stone. She stands in the doorway in a simple sleeping gown, a shawl pulled around her shoulders against the March chill. Her dark hair is loose, unpinned for the night.

She looks you over once—dusty from the road, smelling of salt and horse and honest sweat—and something in her face relaxes. Relief, perhaps. Or simply the comfort of having you back.

"You went to the sea," she says. Not a question. She can smell it on you.

She steps aside to let you enter. A single candle burns on the table, alongside a plate of bread and cheese—she waited up, had food ready in case you returned hungry.

"Catalina asked for you at bedtime. I told her Papa was visiting the ships." A small smile. "She informed me that she wants to visit the ships too. Apparently horses are no longer sufficient."

She settles into a chair, watching you, waiting to hear what you've been doing while she navigated the treacherous waters of Roman gossip and Medici bankers.

I take off my sweaty clothes and tell about what I have been doing. And that I plan to rest tonight before I meet the pope tomorrow.

Orchestrated narrative response capturing character reactions and evening transition


Palazzo di San Marco Late Evening, March 21, 1434

Lucia listens as you shed the day's dust and salt. A servant brings warm water for washing; you wave away offers of a full bath. Tonight, simple will do.

She sits curled in her chair, feet tucked beneath her, the shawl pulled close. Her grey-green eyes follow you as you move about the chamber, stripping off the riding clothes, splashing water on your face and arms.

When you describe the captains' council—the honest accounting of failures, the discussion of signals and storm preparation—she nods slowly.

"You gave them a way to speak of the Mistral without shame," she says quietly. "That's harder than it sounds. Men who lose comrades... they either bury it or drown in it. You gave them something else. A way to make the deaths mean something."

At the mention of Pascual—the old lookout who called the storm, who kept your secret—she smiles faintly. "Every fleet needs men like that. Men who watch while others sleep. I hope you remember his name."

When you tell her about the prizes—the casks for every ship, the Umbrian red for the winners—she laughs softly. "The Ferrarese way. My uncle always said: 'A man fights for duty, but he runs for wine.'"

She rises as you finish washing, crosses to you, and rests her hand briefly on your chest. The skin is cool against your damp skin.

"You needed this. The ships, the sea, something real after days of closed doors and whispers." She studies your face. "You look more like yourself than you have since we arrived in Rome."

She steps back, gestures toward the bed.

"Sleep. Tomorrow you kneel before the Pope." A pause, something flickering in her expression. "And tomorrow, amore mio, you cannot solve the problem with cannons and wine."

I sleep and get ready the next day for the pope.

Orchestrated papal audience preparations and strategic negotiation framework






Palazzo di San Marco Morning, March 22, 1434

You sleep deeply, dreamlessly—the exhaustion of a day at sea, the clarity of honest work. When you wake, grey dawn light filters through the shutters.

Lucia is already up, seated at the small table, reviewing something. She glances over as you stir.

"The summons came at first light," she says. "The Holy Father will receive you at the tenth hour."

Three hours. Time enough to prepare.

Servants bring breakfast—bread, cheese, olives, watered wine. You eat without tasting, your mind already moving ahead. Lucia helps you dress: not armor, not the crusader's white, but the formal attire of a Christian king. Dark velvet doublet, the Castilian arms embroidered at the breast. A gold chain of office. Your sword—ceremonial, but present. You are a king come to treat with the Vicar of Christ, not a penitent come to beg.

Fray Hernando arrives as you finish dressing. He looks tired—he has been praying, you suspect, much of the night.

"Your Majesty." He studies your face. "Are you ready?"

The question has layers. Ready for the ceremony, yes. Ready for whatever Eugenius will demand, will offer, will withhold? That remains to be seen.

Lucia adjusts your collar, a wifely gesture that settles something in your chest.

"Remember what we learned," she says quietly. "He's desperate. He's cautious. He's been burned before." Her grey-green eyes meet yours. "Show him you're different."

The Vatican Tenth Hour

The walk to the Vatican is short but weighted. You bring only Fray Hernando and four guards—enough for dignity, not enough to threaten. The 591 knights remain at their billets. This is not a show of force.

The papal guards admit you through the bronze doors. A chamberlain in red robes leads you through corridors you remember from your first visit—was it only a year ago? The marble saints watch from their niches. The air smells of incense and old stone.

Finally, a set of doors. The chamberlain announces you:

"His Most Catholic Majesty, Juan the Second, by the Grace of God King of Castile and León."

The doors open.

The chamber beyond is smaller than you expected—not the great audience hall but a private reception room. Tapestries on the walls, a fire burning low, windows looking out over Rome. A throne-like chair at one end, but not the formal papal throne.

And there, rising from that chair as you enter:

Pope Eugenius IV.

He is perhaps fifty, thin-faced, with deep-set eyes that have seen too much disappointment. He wears simple white robes—no tiara, no ceremonial vestments. This is a private audience, then. Intimate. The kind where real things might be said.

Two figures flank him: a secretary with quill and parchment, and—your eyes catch—Cardinal Capranica, standing quietly to one side. The cardinal who caught your eye at Mass. Who murmured that the Pope was watching.

Eugenius extends his hand, the Fisherman's Ring glinting.

"Fili dilecte." Beloved son. His voice is thin but steady. "We have waited with great anticipation to speak with the king who completed what seven centuries could not."

Analyzed NPC motivations, mapped conversational dynamics, constructed reaction framework










I've reviewed the context. Now let me think about this encounter carefully.

NPC Analysis: Pope Eugenius IV

What does Eugenius want?

To understand Juan's true loyalties (Basel or Rome?)
To secure Juan's military strength for papal interests
To NOT appear weak or dependent on a foreign king
To learn what Juan promised at Basel before revealing his own position
Money—the Camera is desperate, though he won't admit it
The Constantinople expedition to succeed (strengthens him against Basel)
What won't he say?

How desperate his financial situation truly is
How much he fears Basel's power to depose him
That he needs Juan more than Juan needs him
That the French cardinals have been whispering warnings about Juan
His uncertainty about whether to trust a king who walks middle paths
D100: Pope Eugenius IV's Initial Response
The Situation: Juan kneels, kisses the ring, and asks an open question about how the Pope has been faring before offering to help the Church. This is humble—but also evasive. Juan mentioned Basel first. Eugenius is a politician who has been burned before. He wants to know where Juan stands before revealing anything.

Success Factors
Juan completed the Reconquista—undeniable moral authority
591 knights ready for Constantinople—action, not words
Juan's humility in asking before demanding
Cardinal Capranica present—signaled interest already
Fray Hernando respected by Vatican (Orsini questioned him for three hours about Juan's soul)
Juan carries Emperor Sigismund's letter—united front
Failure Factors
Juan mentioned Basel first—raises loyalty question immediately
French faction has been whispering warnings about Juan
Eugenius has been burned before (Cesarini sided with Council, Sigismund's mediation produced nothing)
Juan's opening is passive—might seem like fishing for information before committing
Vatican deliberately maintained distance these past days—instructions from above
Orsini, once warm, treated Fray Hernando as a stranger—something has changed
The Table
1-10: Cold Suspicion Eugenius's expression does not warm. He releases Juan's hand quickly, returns to his seat without invitation for Juan to rise. "Basel. Yes. We have heard much of what was done at Basel." The emphasis is deliberate. "We have also heard much of what was said—about parallel authorities, about reforms that would bind the Holy See." He lets the silence stretch. "You speak of learning how We fare before determining how you might help. An interesting formulation. It suggests conditions. Prerequisites." His eyes are hard. "We wonder, beloved son, whether you come as a servant of the Church—or as a negotiator with terms already prepared." He waits. This is an interrogation, not a welcome.

11-25: Guarded Deflection Eugenius smiles—thin, diplomatic, revealing nothing. "How have We fared? As the Vicar of Christ always fares—carrying burdens that would crush lesser men, sustained only by grace." He gestures vaguely. "But you did not ride through the night to hear an old man's complaints." He remains standing, not inviting Juan to rise—a subtle assertion of authority. "You mention Basel. You were there for many months. You signed declarations. You spoke before the Council." He tilts his head. "Perhaps, beloved son, you should tell Us how the Church fares—from the perspective of one who has walked among those who would reform her." The question beneath the question: whose side are you on?

26-40: Polite Distance "Rise, beloved son." Eugenius gestures, and Juan may stand—but the Pope does not embrace him, does not draw him close. He returns to his chair, settling into it with the careful movements of a man conserving strength. "We have fared as God wills. The Church endures. She has endured worse than councils and politics." A pause. "You speak of Basel. Cardinal Capranica—" a glance at the silent cardinal, "—has kept Us informed of your movements there. The Como declaration. Your speech before the Council. Your... bridge-building." The word is neutral, neither praise nor criticism. "We are curious what you believe you accomplished. And what you believe remains to be done." He waits, offering nothing, seeking to draw Juan out.

41-55: Testing the Waters Eugenius studies Juan for a long moment after he kneels. Then, slowly, he extends his hand again—not for the ring, but to raise Juan up. "Come. Sit." He gestures to a chair placed facing his own—an unusual informality. Cardinal Capranica remains standing, watchful. "You ask how We fare. We shall answer honestly: We fare as a man who has learned that trust is a currency easily spent and slowly earned." His eyes hold Juan's. "You went to Basel as a king with Our blessing. You returned having signed declarations with the Emperor, having spoken of reforms, having walked paths between factions." A pause. "We do not yet know what to make of you, King Juan. The Reconquista speaks well of you. Your presence here with 600 knights speaks well. But Basel..." He spreads his hands. "Basel complicates things. Tell Us plainly: what do you want from this audience?"

56-70: Cautious Interest Eugenius's expression softens—slightly. "Rise." He comes forward himself, takes Juan's arm, guides him to stand. It's a gesture of respect, if not warmth. "You ask how We fare. We shall tell you: We fare better this week than last. Do you know why?" He doesn't wait for an answer. "Because a king who completed the Reconquista has brought 600 knights to Rome and knelt before Us asking how he might serve the Church. This is... not nothing." He returns to his seat, gestures for Juan to take the chair opposite. Cardinal Capranica moves closer, listening. "We have heard reports from Basel. We know of Como. We know you have tried to walk a middle path." A pause. "Middle paths are treacherous, beloved son. They satisfy no one and anger everyone. Tell Us—do you still believe such a path is possible? Or has Basel taught you otherwise?"

71-85: Genuine Engagement Something shifts in Eugenius's face when Juan asks about how he might help. The wariness doesn't disappear, but it recedes. "You are the first monarch in three years to ask that question without immediately following it with demands." He rises from his chair, moves to the window, looks out over Rome. "How have We fared? Poorly, if We are honest. The Council presses. The Camera bleeds. The Colonna watch for weakness. And France—" He stops himself, shakes his head. "But you did not come to hear an inventory of Our troubles." He turns back. "You came from Basel. You signed Como with the Emperor. You have seen both sides of this war that is not yet a war." His voice is quieter now. "What did you see, King Juan? Not what you said in speeches—what did you see? Because We have been trapped in Rome, and We need eyes We can trust."

86-95: Unexpected Warmth Eugenius rises from his chair as Juan kneels—rises and comes forward, taking Juan's hands in both of his own, raising him up. The gesture is almost paternal. "Enough. Enough kneeling." His voice is rougher than expected, emotional. "Do you know how long it has been since a Christian king came to Us without an outstretched hand? Without demands disguised as petitions?" He leads Juan to the window, away from the secretary with his quill, away from even Capranica. His voice drops. "You ask how We fare. We fare as a man who has watched his authority questioned, his treasury emptied, his allies drift away one by one. We fare as a man who prays each night for a sign that God has not abandoned His Church." He looks at Juan directly. "And then you arrive. With your knights. With your completed crusade. Asking how you might help." A pause. "Perhaps you are the sign. Perhaps not. But We will hear you, King Juan. Truly hear you. What would you have Us know?"

96-100: Providence Recognized Eugenius's reaction is immediate and unexpected. As Juan kneels, the Pope rises—but instead of extending the ring, he comes forward, places his hands on Juan's shoulders, and raises him bodily. His eyes are bright with something that might be tears. "We watched you." His voice is barely above a whisper. "From Our window. Three days ago. You and your knights, walking to St. Peter's. Unarmed. Carrying the cross." He grips Juan's shoulders. "Do you know what We thought? We thought: this is what the Church was meant to be. Men of faith who act, not argue. Who kneel before God, not before committees." He releases Juan, steps back, composes himself with visible effort. Cardinal Capranica looks startled—this was not expected. "You ask how We fare. We shall tell you everything. And then—" His voice steadies. "Then We shall ask what you need, beloved son. Because it is clear to Us now that God has sent you. The only question is what He intends Us to build together."

Shall I roll, or do you have a d100 ready?

Calibrated cautious interest and probed character loyalties strategically




The Vatican Private Audience Chamber March 22, 1434

Eugenius's expression softens—slightly. The deep-set eyes remain watchful, but the initial guardedness recedes a fraction.

"Rise."

He comes forward himself, takes Juan's arm with thin but steady fingers, guides him to stand. It's a gesture of respect, if not warmth. The Fisherman's Ring catches the light from the window.

"You ask how We fare. We shall tell you: We fare better this week than last." He releases Juan's arm, moves back toward his chair but does not sit. "Do you know why?"

He doesn't wait for an answer.

"Because a king who completed the Reconquista has brought six hundred knights to Rome and knelt before Us asking how he might serve the Church. This is... not nothing."

He settles into his seat now, gestures for Juan to take the chair opposite. It's placed facing the papal chair directly—a conversation between near-equals, not a supplicant before a throne. Cardinal Capranica shifts position, moving closer. The secretary's quill hovers over parchment.

"We have heard reports from Basel." Eugenius's voice is measured, careful. "We know of Como. We know you signed declarations with the Emperor. We know you addressed the Council, that you spoke of reforms, that the Castilian delegation has become—" he pauses, selecting the word, "—influential among the moderate voices."

A longer pause. Those deep-set eyes study Juan's face.

"We also know that you have tried to walk a middle path. Between Us and the Council. Between authority and reform. Between those who would make the Pope a figurehead and those who would make reform impossible."

He leans back slightly, fingers steepled.

"Middle paths are treacherous, beloved son. They satisfy no one and anger everyone. The French whisper that you are Rome's creature. Rome wonders if you have been seduced by Basel's promises." A thin smile, without warmth. "You cannot serve two masters. Scripture is clear on this point."

The fire crackles. Outside, Rome's bells mark the hour.

"Tell Us—" Eugenius's voice drops, more direct now, "—do you still believe such a path is possible? Or has Basel taught you otherwise?"

There are many different ways you can look at our church, not just as a divide between papal and council parties. You can also divide the church in terms of culture, such as the french, Iberian, German... There are those of rigorous faith and those more lenient. The church is as diverse as it is enormous. 

And it is my firm belief that we should unite in one single church and there should be a place for almost everyone. Frenc, Germans, rigorous, and lenient, all aspects of our faith that indicate that men are different from one of another. 

How we can achieve this, that is indeed the difficult middle path you mentioned. I have often thought back to our first meeting where you expressed the desire to reform the church. Im sure you have heard of paralell legislation and how this principle will allow reform to proceed without papal authority bowing down to the council. Basel has passed reforms, has our holiness have had time to review these decrees?

Analyzed papal motivations and crafted strategic response framework










What does Eugenius want? To see if parallel legislation actually protects his authority or merely makes him a rubber stamp for Basel. To understand what Juan gets out of this arrangement. To not appear desperate even though he is.

What won't he say? That he's already heard of parallel legislation and has been thinking about it. That the Camera's finances make reform concessions almost inevitable. That he fears appearing weak more than he fears the reforms themselves.

The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius listens without interruption. His expression remains unreadable, though his fingers tap once, twice against the arm of his chair when Juan mentions their first meeting.

When Juan finishes, the Pope is silent for a long moment.

"Parallel legislation."

He repeats the phrase slowly, tasting it.

"We have heard this term. From Basel. From the Emperor's letters. Now from you." He rises from his chair, moves to the window, his back to Juan. Outside, Rome spreads beneath the pale March sky.

"You propose that We independently promulgate the same reforms that Basel has passed. That We claim them as Our own initiative rather than Council decree. That both authorities take credit, neither bows to the other." His voice is neutral, clinical. "A elegant solution. On parchment."

He turns back, silhouetted against the window.

"But tell Us, beloved son—" his tone sharpens, "—if Basel passes a decree in September, and We pass the identical decree in April, who does Christendom believe truly authored the reform? The Council that acted first? Or the Pope who... followed?"

He moves closer, his eyes fixed on Juan.

"You ask if We have reviewed Basel's decrees. We have. Pluralism. Annates. Concubinage. Much of it is..." he pauses, as if the admission costs him, "...reasonable. Even necessary. But how reform comes matters as much as what reform comes. If We simply sign what Basel has already written, We become a notary. A clerk who stamps documents prepared by others."

He stops before Juan's chair, looking down.

"Explain to Us how this is not surrender with better rhetoric."

The council has been unexpectedly productive. They have been able to agree on many subjects, much more so than I thought possible. Since the council passed many reforms already, if Rome passes the same reforms as well, the impression can indeed be made that Rome follows Basel. I must confess that I did not expect this. I had hoped that both entities could pass some reforms and could demonstrate that they could both sign each other's decrees. 

I agree with you that the reforms themselves are good. Looking at just the church and how it should be reformed, we should be signing them today. If your holyness agrees with me, but only has reservations about authority, we should now seek a way to reform the church while maintaining papal authority.

8 dec 2025

Analyzed negotiation dynamics and probed for Juan's concrete proposals







What does Eugenius want? Specifics, not theory. A concrete mechanism that preserves his dignity. To understand what Juan wants in exchange—because there's always an exchange.

What won't he say? That he's relieved someone is finally offering a path forward. That the annates reform terrifies the Camera. That he's been waiting for exactly this conversation.

The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius is still for a moment. Then he returns to his chair, lowering himself slowly, deliberately. When he speaks, his voice has lost some of its edge.

"You confess you did not expect this. That Basel moved faster than you anticipated." A pause. "We find your honesty... refreshing. Most who come before Us have answers for everything. You admit to miscalculation."

He steeples his fingers again, studying Juan over them.

"You say We should seek a way to reform while maintaining papal authority. Yes. Obviously. But how?" The word is sharp, impatient. "You speak in principles. We must act in specifics. Basel has passed decrees on pluralism, on annates, on concubinage. The ink is dry. The documents are being copied and sent across Christendom as we speak."

He leans forward.

"If We sign identical decrees tomorrow, We follow. If We refuse to sign, We appear to oppose reform itself—which We do not." His jaw tightens. "If We modify the decrees, We invite endless negotiation about which version holds force. Basel will claim theirs is superior because the Council is superior. We will claim Ours. Christendom will have two sets of laws and obey neither."

Cardinal Capranica shifts slightly. The secretary's quill has stopped moving.

"You have come with 600 knights, with letters from the Emperor, with the moral weight of Granada behind you." Eugenius's eyes narrow. "You have not come empty-handed, and you have not come without purpose. So speak plainly, King Juan."

He spreads his hands.

"What specifically do you propose We do? And what do you want in return for helping Us do it?"

What we could do, is we sign the reforms everyone agrees on. Pluralism for example and concubinage, maybe some other decrees as well. And then immediately and without delay start enforcing these decrees. Start enforcing the concubinage decree in France for example and demand the french to cooperate and in effect bow down to your authority. The council has already passed the decree so they have no other choice than to defer to your judgement. This creates equality and demonstrates Rome holds authority. 

Secondly, pass a decree yourself the council has not adressed. Choose a subject no-one can object to and request the council to pass the decree as well. If they don't it will make them look like extremists who use politics to advance their own positions. The more decrees are passed by both sides using this system, the more the council loses in significance. We can start sending Italian delegates as well untill the council is simply not relevant anymore.

Analyzed papal motivations, strategy weaknesses, and crafted reaction framework







NPC Analysis: Pope Eugenius IV

What does Eugenius want?

To test this strategy for weaknesses before committing
To know Juan's price—no one offers this much help for free
To understand the practical obstacles (money, enforcement, French resistance)
To not appear so desperate that he accepts the first plan offered
To see if Juan has thought this through or is merely clever
What won't he say?

That this is better than anything his own advisors have proposed
That the annates reform specifically terrifies him (75% revenue loss)
That enforcement in France would require resources the Camera doesn't have
How much he wants to believe this could work
That Cardinal Capranica has been advocating for something similar
D100: Pope Eugenius IV Reacts to Juan's Concrete Proposal
The Situation: Juan has offered a specific, actionable strategy: sign Basel's reforms immediately, enforce them aggressively (especially in France) to demonstrate papal authority, then issue a papal decree on an unaddressed subject and pressure Basel to follow. It's clever. It's concrete. And Eugenius hasn't heard Juan's price yet.

Success Factors
The strategy is genuinely sophisticated—better than mere theory
It addresses Eugenius's specific concern about appearing to "follow"
Enforcement in France would indeed force French cardinals to choose
The counter-decree idea could work politically
Juan has proven himself capable at Basel—this isn't empty talk
Capranica is present and may have advocated similar approaches
Failure Factors
Eugenius has been burned before by clever plans (Como produced nothing concrete)
Enforcing decrees in France requires money and capacity the Camera lacks
Juan still hasn't named his price—creates suspicion
The French faction has warned Eugenius about Juan's influence
Annates reform would devastate papal revenues—not mentioned yet
Eugenius may see this as Juan positioning himself as papal puppet-master
The Table
1-10: Sharp Rejection Eugenius's expression hardens. "Enforce the concubinage decree in France. Demand the French cooperate." His voice is cold. "You speak as though We command legions. As though the French crown trembles at Our word. As though the Camera overflows with gold to fund enforcement across Christendom." He rises abruptly. "This is fantasy dressed as strategy. France has defied Rome for a century. Their Pragmatic Sanction treats Our authority as advisory at best. And you propose We demand their cooperation?" He turns away. "You have not come to help Us, King Juan. You have come to make Us dependent on Castilian swords while speaking of Our authority. We see the shape of this arrangement." The audience is not over—but the temperature has dropped sharply.

11-20: Suspicious Probing Eugenius listens, but his eyes narrow with each point. When Juan finishes, the Pope does not respond to the strategy at all. Instead: "You propose that We sign decrees, enforce them across hostile territories, issue counter-decrees, flood Basel with delegates—a comprehensive campaign requiring years of effort and substantial resources." He pauses. "And you have not yet mentioned what Castile receives in return." His voice sharpens. "We have learned, beloved son, that gifts freely offered are never free. The Emperor offered mediation and produced Como—which bound Us to nothing and gave Basel legitimacy. Now you offer strategy. What is the price beneath the wrapping? Speak it plainly, or We shall assume the worst."

21-35: Practical Objections Eugenius tilts his head, considering. "The logic is... not without merit. But you speak of enforcement as though it were simple." He raises a finger. "Concubinage in France. Do you know how many French bishops keep women? How many cathedral chapters would resist? How many appeals would flood Rome, each requiring adjudication?" A second finger. "The Camera's finances. Enforcement requires investigators, tribunals, messengers, notaries. These cost money We do not have—particularly if We also sign the annates reform, which would reduce Our revenues by three-quarters." A third finger. "And your counter-decree. What subject? Basel has addressed pluralism, concubinage, annates, elections. What remains that is both significant and uncontroversial?" He spreads his hands. "We do not reject your thinking. But We need more than principles. We need answers to these questions."

36-50: Guarded Interest The Pope is silent for a long moment. Cardinal Capranica shifts almost imperceptibly—something has registered. "Enforce in France," Eugenius repeats slowly. "Force the French to defer to Our judgment on a decree they themselves supported at Basel." His fingers tap the chair arm. "There is... cunning in this. The Council cannot object to enforcement of their own legislation. The French cardinals here would be caught between their faction and their country." A pause. "But cunning is not execution. France is not Castile. Their king does not kneel easily. Their clergy shelter behind the Pragmatic Sanction." He fixes Juan with a steady gaze. "You completed the Reconquista. You know what enforcement truly costs—in gold, in blood, in years. Tell Us honestly: do you believe this can be done? And if so—" his voice drops, "—what role does Castile play in doing it?"

51-65: Serious Engagement Eugenius leans forward. For the first time, genuine interest breaks through the diplomatic mask. "A decree Rome passes that Basel has not addressed. Then pressure them to follow." He exchanges a glance with Cardinal Capranica—brief, significant. "This inverts the dynamic. We lead, they follow—or they reveal themselves as obstructionists." He rises, moves to the window, speaks with his back turned. "We have considered something similar. A decree on... but no. First, your strategy for enforcement. France is the critical test. The French faction here reports everything to Cardinal d'Allemand. If We move against French clergy, they will know within days. They will organize resistance." He turns back. "How do you propose We overcome this? And—" his eyes narrow slightly, "—you still have not named your price, King Juan. We grow curious what you want from Us."

66-80: Genuine Collaboration Something shifts in the room. Eugenius glances at Capranica, who gives an almost imperceptible nod. When the Pope speaks, his voice has changed—less guarded, more direct. "Sit forward, King Juan. We would speak plainly now." He leans toward Juan. "Your strategy has merit. Real merit. The enforcement approach—using Basel's own decrees to demonstrate papal authority—this We had not considered so clearly. And the counter-decree..." He pauses. "We have a subject in mind. Constantinople. Basel passed their crusade decree in December, but it is vague on command, vague on duration, vague on authority. We could issue a complementary decree—specific, practical—and challenge Basel to match Our clarity." His eyes sharpen. "But We need resources. Money. Political support. And someone to actually lead this expedition who can be trusted." He lets the implication hang. "What does Castile need from Rome to make this work?"

81-90: Near Alliance Eugenius rises and does something unexpected—he gestures for the secretary to stop writing. The quill lifts from parchment. Cardinal Capranica's eyebrows rise slightly. "What We say now is between Us." The Pope moves closer, his voice dropping. "Your strategy is sound. Better than sound—it is the first concrete path anyone has offered Us in three years of this crisis. Enforce Basel's own decrees, then lead with Our own initiative. Yes." He grips the arm of his chair. "We have been waiting for someone who understands that this war is won through action, not argument. Granada proves you understand this." A pause, weighted. "Tell Us what you need. Constantinople support—yes, obviously. What else? We are prepared to bargain seriously. But We must know your full position before We commit."

91-100: Unexpected Openness Eugenius holds up his hand, stopping Juan before he can say more. He turns to the secretary. "Leave Us. You as well, Domenico—" this to Capranica, who hesitates, then bows and withdraws. The door closes. The Pope and King are alone. Eugenius's entire demeanor changes—the diplomatic mask falls away, revealing exhaustion and something like desperate hope beneath. "No more fencing. You have given Us the first workable strategy We have heard since this nightmare began. Enforcement through their own decrees. Counter-legislation to seize initiative. Flooding Basel with moderates until it withers." He sits heavily. "We accept. In principle, We accept all of it. Now tell Us what you need—for Constantinople, for Castile, for yourself personally. Because you did not come here out of pure devotion to the Church, however genuine your faith may be. Name your price, King Juan. If it is within Our power, you shall have it."

Shall I roll, or do you have a d100 ready?

Determined NPC would demand clarification on player's intentions




The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius listens. His face remains impassive throughout—no nods of agreement, no sharpening of interest. When Juan finishes, the Pope does not respond to the strategy at all.

Instead, silence stretches.

Then:

"You propose that We sign decrees. Enforce them across hostile territories—France, no less. Issue counter-decrees. Flood Basel with Italian delegates until the Council withers." He ticks each point off on thin fingers. "A comprehensive campaign. Years of effort. Substantial resources. Political capital spent across Christendom."

He settles back in his chair, fingers steepled.

"And you have not yet mentioned what Castile receives in return."

The words hang in the air. Cardinal Capranica shifts slightly. The secretary's quill hovers, waiting.

"We have learned, beloved son, that gifts freely offered are never free." Eugenius's voice carries the weariness of a man who has been disappointed too many times. "The Emperor offered mediation at Como. He spoke of cooperation, of bridges between Rome and Basel, of shared purpose. And what did Como produce? A declaration that bound Us to nothing and gave Basel legitimacy to continue. Words. Paper. Nothing that cost Sigismund anything."

He leans forward, those deep-set eyes fixed on Juan.

"Now you come. With knights. With letters. With strategies that sound reasonable and cost you nothing to propose. You speak of enforcing decrees in France—but Castilian swords will not march on Paris. You speak of flooding Basel with delegates—but Castile has already positioned itself as a moderate voice there, which serves your interests regardless of what We do."

His voice sharpens.

"What is the price beneath the wrapping, King Juan? What does Castile want that you have not yet named? Constantinople support? We expected that. What else? Naples recognition for your ally Alfonso? Permanent administration of your Military Orders? A cardinal's hat for someone in your household?"

He spreads his hands.

"Speak it plainly. All of it. Or We shall assume the worst—that you seek to make the Pope of Rome dependent on Castilian strategy while appearing to serve the Church."

Father, I come before you as a christian king. Castille owes it's entire existance to Christianity and the church. In that case the fate of the church and Castille are intertwined. Crusades have formed my kingdoms and has given me and my fathers so much purpose. We would be nothing without our faith and we would have not been able to unite without the church.

I seek no monetary support, no position for a bishop, no recognition of claims. The fact alone that there exists a strong and unified church is of enormous importance to me and my kingdom. 

But there is also another matter that makes me want a unified church father, and that reason is more personal. I have a strong personal belief that the church is of enormous benefit, not just to my kingdom but to any kingdom. Farmers being called to mass by church bells all across the lands fills my heart with joy. To know God is being praised, confessions are being taken. To know we all lift one another up to live fulfilling lives in service. It is all I want, what I am fighting for and strikes me in my very core. I dont need the church to endorse my crusade and aid me in my aid to Constantinople, I have already pledged the aid. But even I cannot defeat the Ottomans alone and I see no world where all christians unite to fight without a strong church.

Weighed Juan's genuine faith against Eugenius's hardened skepticism and political wariness











NPC Analysis: Pope Eugenius IV

What does Eugenius want?

To believe this is real—but he's been burned too many times
To find the hidden catch, because there's always a catch
To test whether Juan's faith is genuine or sophisticated rhetoric
To protect himself from appearing naive if this turns out to be manipulation
To understand why a king would truly want nothing
What won't he say?

That Juan's words about church bells and confessions touched something in him
That no one has spoken to him about faith—not politics—in years
That his own faith has been corroded by endless political warfare
How desperately he wants to believe someone actually cares about the Church itself
That he's afraid his cynicism has made him unable to recognize genuine devotion
D100: Pope Eugenius IV Responds to Juan's Declaration of Faith
The Situation: Eugenius demanded to know Juan's price. Juan responded with... no price. Just faith. An impassioned speech about church bells, confessions, the unity of Christendom. Either this is the rarest thing in politics—genuine selflessness—or it's the most sophisticated manipulation Eugenius has ever encountered. He cannot tell which.

Success Factors
Juan asked for nothing concrete—completely disarms the challenge
The imagery (church bells, farmers at Mass) is how a true believer talks
Juan already pledged Constantinople aid unconditionally—actions before words
Granada proves Juan acts on faith, not just speaks of it
Eugenius is himself a man of faith beneath the political armor
The speech resonates with why Eugenius became Pope in the first place
Failure Factors
Eugenius has been burned repeatedly (Cesarini, Sigismund, countless others)
"I want nothing" often means "I'm hiding what I want"
The French faction has specifically warned Eugenius about Juan
The more perfect the speech, the more suspicious it seems
Eugenius asked a direct question and received poetry—evasion?
No king is this selfless—medieval politics doesn't work this way
Prior suspicion (roll of 16) creates momentum toward doubt
The Table
1-10: Hardened Suspicion Eugenius's face closes like a door. "Church bells. Farmers at Mass. Confessions lifting souls to God." His voice is flat, reciting. "Beautiful words, King Juan. We have heard beautiful words before. From Cardinal Cesarini, who wept when he spoke of Church unity—then sided with Basel. From the Emperor, who invoked Christ's name at Como—then gave Us nothing." He rises abruptly. "You say you want nothing. You say the Church's strength is reward enough. Do you know what We hear? We hear a man who refuses to name his price because naming it would reveal its size." He moves to the window, back turned. "This audience is not over. But We require time to consider what you have said—and what you have not said. Cardinal Capranica will show you to an antechamber. We will summon you when We are ready to continue." The dismissal is clear. Eugenius does not turn around.

11-20: Cold Testing "You seek nothing." Eugenius repeats the words without inflection. "No monetary support. No positions. No recognition of claims. Only the joy of church bells ringing across Christendom." A pause. "Forgive Us, King Juan, but We have occupied Peter's throne for three years. In that time, every cardinal, every ambassador, every king and duke and count who has knelt before Us has wanted something. Every one." His eyes are hard. "You completed the Reconquista—a great deed. You bring knights to fight for Constantinople—admirable. But you are also heir presumptive to Aragón. Your ally Alfonso seeks Naples. Your Military Orders petition for permanent royal administration. Your kingdom's trade requires Mediterranean access." He spreads his hands. "These are not accusations. These are realities. So when you speak of wanting only a strong Church... We wonder which of these realities you hope a strong Church will serve."

21-35: Probing for Cracks Eugenius is quiet for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice is softer—but no less searching. "You speak of faith. Of church bells calling farmers to Mass. Of confessions and purpose and unity." A pause. "We believe you mean these words. We do not believe they are the whole truth." He leans forward. "You are a king, Juan of Castile. Kings do not travel a thousand miles, risk their fleets to storms, bring their pregnant wives to foreign cities, for abstractions. However genuine your faith—and We do not question it—there are concrete matters you wish to discuss. Constantinople. The Military Orders. Perhaps other things." His tone is not accusatory, but firm. "We will hear your faith. We are moved by it. But We will also hear your necessities. Name them. All of them. Then We can speak as men who understand each other, not as a supplicant mouthing pieties and a Pope pretending to believe them."

36-50: Grudging Recognition Eugenius studies Juan for a long moment. Something flickers across his face—doubt, perhaps, warring with something else. "You speak as a man of faith speaks. Not as diplomats speak, with their careful constructions and hidden meanings. We have heard enough diplomats to know the difference." He rises, moves slowly, as if weighing each step. "We do not say We believe you entirely. We have learned that belief is a luxury Popes cannot afford. But We say this: if you are deceiving Us, you are the finest deceiver We have ever encountered. And if you are not..." He trails off, turns to face Juan. "The matters you wish to discuss—Constantinople, the reforms, whatever else—We will hear them. But first, answer Us one thing more. You say you cannot defeat the Ottomans alone. You say Christendom must unite. How? With what force? France will not march. England is consumed by its own wars. The Germans squabble. Who, King Juan, do you imagine will answer this call?"

51-65: Cautious Thaw Silence. Eugenius's fingers tap the arm of his chair—once, twice, three times. Then they stop. "We have been Pope for three years," he says quietly. "In that time, We have heard many speak of the Church. Of reform. Of unity. Of the faith that binds Christendom together." A pause. "They speak of these things to get what they want. The Church is a tool to them. A means to an end." He looks at Juan directly. "You speak differently. We cannot yet say whether this is because you are different, or because you are more skilled than the others. But..." He hesitates, as if the admission costs him. "It has been a long time since anyone spoke to Us about church bells. About the simple grace of farmers gathering for Mass." His voice roughens slightly. "We remember why We became a priest. Before politics. Before Basel. We remember." He straightens. "Very well, King Juan. We will not demand you name a price. We will instead ask: what do you need from Us to make Constantinople possible? Not as payment—as partnership."

66-75: Moved but Guarded Eugenius is silent for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice has changed—rougher, less controlled. "Church bells." He repeats the words as if tasting them. "Do you know how long it has been since someone spoke to Us of church bells? Of the simple faith of farmers gathering for Mass?" He rises, but not in dismissal—in restlessness. "We are surrounded by men who speak of the Church as a political institution. Revenues. Authority. Jurisdictions. Even the reformers at Basel—they speak of structures, of laws, of who holds power over whom." He turns to face Juan. "You speak of something else. Of why the Church exists at all." A pause. "We want to believe you, King Juan. God help Us, We want to believe someone still cares about the Church itself and not just what it can provide." His jaw tightens. "But wanting to believe is dangerous. Tell Us of Constantinople. Of what you need. Let Us see if your actions align with your words."

76-85: Beginning to Trust Something shifts in Eugenius's expression. The wariness doesn't disappear, but beneath it—something older. Something that might be recognition. "You speak of Castile owing its existence to Christianity. Of crusades giving your fathers purpose." His voice is quieter now. "We understand this. We came from Venice—a city of merchants who weigh everything in ducats. We became a priest because We believed the Church was more than an institution. More than politics. More than power." He sits heavily. "We have almost forgotten that belief, King Juan. Three years of Basel. Three years of being told We are a tyrant, or a figurehead, or an obstacle to reform. Three years of men who speak of the Church only to tear pieces from her." He looks at Juan with something approaching vulnerability. "If you are what you claim to be—a king who fights for the Church because he loves her—then you are the ally We have prayed for. If you are not..." He shakes his head. "We will trust you. Provisionally. Tell Us what you need for Constantinople. Tell Us what the Church can do. And We will see if this trust is warranted."

86-95: Genuine Connection Eugenius rises from his chair. He waves a hand at Cardinal Capranica without looking at him. "Domenico. Leave Us." The cardinal hesitates. "Now." Capranica bows and withdraws. The secretary follows without being told. The door closes. Eugenius moves closer to Juan, his voice dropping. "We are going to say something We have not said to anyone. Not to Our cardinals. Not to Our confessors." A pause. "We have been losing Our faith." The words seem to cost him physical pain. "Not in God. In the Church. In whether she can be saved. Whether she is worth saving. Basel calls Us corrupt. Perhaps they are right. The Camera is empty. The cardinals scheme. Rome itself is held together with prayers and threats." He grips Juan's arm. "And then you come. Speaking of church bells. Of farmers at Mass. Of why any of this matters." His eyes are bright. "We do not know if you are the answer to Our prayers or the most dangerous man We have ever met. But We know We must find out. Tell Us everything, King Juan. Constantinople, the Ottomans, what you truly need. We are listening—not as Pope to supplicant, but as one Christian to another."

96-100: The Mask Falls Eugenius makes a sound—half laugh, half something else. He turns away, moves to the window, and for a long moment says nothing. When he speaks, his voice is thick. "Twenty-three years ago, We stood in a church in Venice. A small church. Poor. The priest was old, barely able to lift the host. The congregation was fishermen and their wives. And We knew—knew—that God was present. That the Church was holy. That nothing else mattered." He turns back, and his eyes are wet. "We have not felt that certainty since We became Pope. Politics has poisoned everything. Every word, every gesture, every alliance—all of it calculated, weighed, measured against advantage." He crosses to Juan, takes his hands in both of his own. "You speak of church bells, and We remember that church in Venice. You speak of farmers at Mass, and We remember why We gave Our life to Christ." His grip tightens. "We do not care anymore what you want in return. If this is manipulation, then let Us be manipulated for a worthy cause. Tell Us how to save Constantinople. Tell Us how to save the Church. We will give you whatever you need. Just—" His voice breaks. "Just help Us remember why any of this matters."

Shall I roll, or do you have a d100 ready?

Orchestrated emotional breakthrough and vulnerable NPC revelation




The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius rises from his chair.

For a moment he simply stands there, looking at Juan. Then he turns—not to the window, but to Cardinal Capranica.

"Domenico. Leave Us."

Capranica's eyebrows rise. "Holy Father—"

"Now."

The cardinal hesitates only a moment longer. Then he bows—deep, formal—and withdraws. The secretary gathers his parchment and quill with trembling hands, following without being told. The heavy door closes behind them.

The Pope and the King are alone.

Eugenius moves closer. Not to the window, not to his chair—to Juan. He stops an arm's length away, and when he speaks, his voice is barely above a whisper.

"We are going to say something We have not said to anyone. Not to Our cardinals. Not to Our confessors. Not even in the silence of Our own prayers, because We feared God would hear and judge Us for it."

A pause. His thin hands clasp together, knuckles white.

"We have been losing Our faith."

The words seem to cost him something physical. His shoulders bow slightly, as if a weight has been lifted and a greater one placed in its stead.

"Not in God. Never in God. But in the Church. In whether she can be saved. Whether she is worth saving." His voice roughens. "Basel calls Us corrupt. Perhaps they are right. The Camera is empty. The cardinals scheme—even the loyal ones scheme, they simply scheme in Our favor. Rome itself is held together with prayers and threats and the memory of what it once meant."

He begins to pace—short, restless movements, a man who has been still too long.

"For three years We have been told that We are a tyrant. An obstacle to reform. That the Church would flourish if only We would yield, or abdicate, or die. For three years We have defended the authority of Peter's throne, and We no longer remember if We defend it because it is sacred or because surrendering would mean admitting they were right about Us."

He stops. Turns to face Juan.

"And then you come."

His eyes are bright—not with tears, not quite, but with something close to it. The exhaustion of a man who has been holding walls alone.

"Speaking of church bells. Of farmers gathering for Mass. Of confessions and purpose and the joy of knowing God is praised across the land." His voice catches. "Do you know how long it has been since anyone spoke to Us of why the Church exists? Everyone speaks of what she controls. What she costs. What she forbids. No one speaks of what she gives."

He grips Juan's arm—not as Pope to supplicant, but as a man reaching for something solid in dark water.

"We do not know if you are the answer to Our prayers or the most dangerous man We have ever met. We do not know if this is Providence or the most sophisticated manipulation ever attempted against the Holy See."

His grip tightens.

"We do not care."

A breath. Then another.

"Tell Us everything, King Juan. Constantinople. The Ottomans. The reforms. What you need, what you fear, what you hope to build. We are listening—not as Pope to king, not as authority to supplicant—but as one Christian to another. As a man who has forgotten why he became a priest, speaking to a man who seems to remember why he became a king."

He releases Juan's arm. Steps back. The mask of the papacy lies somewhere on the floor between them, and the man beneath stands exposed.

"Help Us remember, Juan of Castile. Help Us believe the Church is worth saving. And We will give you whatever is in Our power to give."

But father! The church has always been worthy! We as men fail. We fear sometimes before we remember that stepping forward into the light is scary because it exposes us, shows everyone we are not perfect. But it also sets us free. 

The church itself is holy, it are the men who sin. We all know this and we fear that speaking this aloud, lets others think that the church sins as well. But this is not true. 

I would say we should sign all decrees passed by Basel and one of our own as well. And start enforcing them immediately. The scism must have drained the coffers of the camera, we should immediately start collecting again. I have no access to the camera itself, but I suspect that a decree properly enforced could actually increase the amount of income the camera recieves. 

We can unify the church like never before father. I know your heart wants genuine reform as well. Those using the Basel council to advance their own position are the real enemy and they are already isolated in Basel. Imagine every corner of Christendom listening to your authority, paying their dues. Papal legates who can enforce policy everywhere. A church creating stability and good law everywhere. Would that not be wonderful?

Reconciled emotional breakthrough with pragmatic NPC agency and institutional concerns









The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius listens. The vulnerability doesn't leave his face, but something else joins it—a sharpening of attention, the Pope emerging alongside the man.

When Juan finishes, Eugenius moves to his chair but doesn't sit. His hands rest on its back, gripping the carved wood.

"The Church is holy. Only men sin." He repeats the words slowly. "Yes. Yes. We knew this once. Before We became the man everyone sins against and everyone blames for sin."

He releases the chair, turns to face Juan fully.

"You speak of signing all Basel's decrees. Enforcing them. Collecting revenues. Unifying Christendom under papal authority." A pause. His voice is steadier now—still raw, but with purpose beneath it. "We want this. God knows We want this. But We must speak of realities, even now."

He begins to pace again, but differently—thinking aloud, not restless.

"The annates decree. Basel reduced papal taxation by three-quarters. Three-quarters, Juan. The Camera is already bleeding. If We sign that decree and enforce it, We enforce Our own impoverishment." He holds up a hand before Juan can respond. "We are not saying We refuse. We are saying We must understand how enforcement increases revenue when the decree itself decreases what We may collect."

He stops pacing.

"And France. You speak of papal legates enforcing policy everywhere. The French have their Pragmatic Sanction—they already treat Our authority as advisory. Their bishops shelter behind royal protection. If We send legates to enforce concubinage decrees against French clergy, the French crown will expel them. What then?"

His eyes meet Juan's—not suspicious now, but searching. Wanting answers.

"We believe you, Juan of Castile. We believe you want what you say you want. But belief alone does not fill treasuries or move armies or make French kings kneel."

He moves closer.

"Help Us understand how. How does enforcement increase revenue? How do We compel France without the power to compel? How do We sign Basel's decrees without appearing to surrender to Basel?"

A pause. When he speaks again, his voice is quieter.

"We are asking as a partner now. Not testing you. Not doubting you. Simply... asking. Because We have dreamed of this unified Church you describe, and We need to know if it can be more than a dream."

Then tell me how the french pragmatic sanction prevents us from collecting Rome's dues.

Grappled with historical anachronism regarding French ecclesiastical independence











The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius pauses. The question is direct—practical—and it catches him slightly off-guard. He moves to his chair now, sitting, gathering his thoughts.

"The French have long claimed what they call libertés gallicanes—Gallican liberties. The principle that the French church governs itself in temporal matters, that royal authority shields French clergy from Roman jurisdiction." He waves a hand. "It is not one document. It is a tradition. A habit of defiance dressed in legal language."

He leans forward, fingers pressed together.

"In practice: when Rome demands payment from a French bishop, he appeals to his archbishop. The archbishop defers to the crown. The crown declares that French clergy pay taxes to the French king, not to foreign powers—and yes, they call Rome a foreign power when it suits them." Bitterness creeps into his voice. "They tithe their own clergy readily enough. But papal collectors? They are delayed. Obstructed. Sometimes simply... not admitted."

He rises again, restless energy returning.

"The Avignon years made it worse. When the papacy sat in France, French kings grew accustomed to a Pope they could influence. Now that we have returned to Rome, they resent paying for a Church they cannot control." He turns to face Juan. "And Basel has given them new weapons. French cardinals—d'Allemand chief among them—argue that councils hold supreme authority. If councils are supreme, then papal taxation requires conciliar approval. Which France will ensure never comes."

He spreads his hands.

"This is what We face. Not a single law We can challenge, but a culture of resistance. A king who benefits from keeping his clergy's gold in France. Bishops who prefer a distant Pope they can ignore to a present one who demands accountability."

His eyes meet Juan's.

"So tell Us, King of Castile—how do We collect from men who have spent a century learning not to pay?"

Why should they pay tax to Rome in the first place? What do they recieve in return? For me and everyone in Iberia, the advantages are very apparent, but for the french? Not so much. Especially if these funds are being used for... excess and sin. And if they get no influence as well, I can understand why feel hesitant to pay. 

What is the money of the camera being used for?

8 dec 2025

Weighed vulnerability against defensiveness regarding papal finances








The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

The question lands like a stone in still water.

Eugenius goes very still. For a long moment he says nothing. Then, slowly, he returns to his chair and sits—not with the authority of a Pope, but with the heaviness of a man confronting something he has avoided.

"You ask what the Camera's money is used for."

He stares at his hands.

"We could give you the official accounting. The maintenance of the Papal States. The defense against Milan's condottieri. The salaries of the Curia—the secretaries, the notaries, the judges who hear appeals from across Christendom. The upkeep of St. Peter's. Charitable distributions. The papal household."

A pause. His jaw tightens.

"We could also tell you the truth."

He looks up at Juan, and there is something like shame in his eyes.

"The truth is that We do not fully know. The Camera has its own bureaucracy. Its own traditions. Funds flow through channels established centuries ago, and when We have asked for accountings, We receive documents so complex that three clerks working for a month could not untangle them."

He rises, moves to the window, speaks with his back turned.

"What We do know: cardinals live in palaces. They keep households of dozens—servants, secretaries, guards, cooks. They host banquets. They patronize artists. They maintain... companions." The word is bitter. "The Curia employs men whose positions were purchased, not earned—sinecures sold to fund some previous Pope's war or building project. And yes, there has been excess. There has been sin."

He turns back.

"You ask what France receives in return for its payments. The honest answer? Less than they should. They send gold to Rome, and Rome sends back... what? Bureaucratic delays. Dispensations that cost additional fees. Legates who demand hospitality and deliver lectures."

His voice drops.

"This is why Basel's critique has power, Juan. Not because they are right about councils being supreme—they are not. But because when they say Rome is corrupt, when they say papal taxation funds luxury rather than ministry..." He spreads his hands. "They are not entirely wrong."

He meets Juan's eyes.

"You ask these questions as if you already know the answers. Perhaps you do. So tell Us—what are you thinking? Because We have just admitted things no Pope should admit, and We find ourselves curious what you will do with this honesty."

But father, this may be exactly what the Lord requires of us. We should ask ourselves if the current situation is something we actually want to change. Do we want a camera with finances that are so complicated that they obscure the real expenses. If we ask Jezus, I think we already know what the answer is going to be. 

If we have our purpose, than the rest just becomes work. We should pull out the camera into the light and find out what is really going on. We are now coming at the heart of the matter I think. The church finances are strained because some men seem to be profiting from it to the detriment of the church. 

Last year I deposited an enormous treasury, gold reserved for future crusades. We can ask the camera right now if they can produce this treasury. There has been no crusade since so it should be intact, every penny of it. What do you think? Has the camera kept it locked away or have they found ways to dip into this pile of gold?

Analyzed high-stakes moment testing papal integrity through financial audit











The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius goes pale.

Not dramatically—not the theatrical shock of a man performing surprise. This is quieter. The color simply drains from his face, leaving it grey and drawn in the afternoon light.

He does not answer immediately.

Instead, he moves to the window. Stands there. His back is to Juan, his shoulders rigid beneath the white robes. When he speaks, his voice is carefully controlled.

"Three hundred and fifteen thousand florins. With complete accounting. Forty-seven pages documenting every expense of your Reconquista, every coin remaining." A pause. "We remember. We were... moved by the gesture. A king who returns a treasury instead of keeping it. Who provides accounting instead of excuses."

His hands clasp behind his back.

"You ask if the Camera has kept it locked away. If every penny remains intact, waiting for the crusade it was meant to fund."

Silence stretches.

"We do not know."

The admission comes out flat. Dead.

"We gave instructions. The treasury was to be held separately. Sacred funds for sacred purpose. But the Camera..." He turns now, and his face is haunted. "Three years of crisis, Juan. Milan's armies threatening the Papal States. The Colonna demanding payment to keep peace in Rome itself. Basel draining Our authority and with it Our ability to collect. The cardinals requiring their... maintenance."

He moves to his chair but does not sit. His hands grip the back of it, knuckles white.

"We signed documents. Many documents. Authorizations for 'temporary transfers' to meet 'immediate needs' with 'full repayment upon resolution of current difficulties.'" His voice is bitter. "We told Ourselves it was necessary. That the crusade funds would be restored. That God would understand."

He looks at Juan directly.

"We do not know if your treasury is intact. We do not know how much remains. We have been afraid to ask."

The Pope of Rome stands before the King of Castile, and in his eyes is the terror of a man who suspects he has stolen from God.

"You propose we ask the Camera now. Pull them into the light." His voice is barely a whisper. "What happens, King Juan, if the answer is what We fear it is?"

We already know the answer father. Maybe not the exact extent of it, but we know. 

I am not so concerned with the crusade coffers being drained. You as pope can act with authority to allocate these funds to wherever you like. But I am more concerned with a camera that seems to be bleeding money at an alarming rate. This is something we should adress immediately. I think there is a lot of popwer around the camera and the funds being allocated. If these funds are being used to defend the church, no objection. But I suspect many men have been profitting from this situation enormously. 

If you want, we can reform the camera together. I have done it before. I call it bringing down the hammer. Forge our kingdom and church as we believe it best in the image of our lord. This is the real work and it can be gracious and beautiful. It also gives purpose to us and those wanting a true church as well.

Excavated Eugenius's hidden fears and motivations regarding Vatican reform






NPC Analysis: Pope Eugenius IV

What does Eugenius want?

Relief from the burden of knowing about corruption he feels powerless to address
Someone to share responsibility for what reform would uncover
To believe he can still be the Pope who fixes things rather than the Pope who let them rot
Protection from the powerful men who benefit from Camera's opacity
To not appear so weak that he needs a foreign king to reform his own house
What won't he say?

How many cardinals would become his enemies if he touched the Camera
That he fears certain curial officials more than he fears Basel
The extent of his own complicity in signing "temporary transfer" documents
That he has never been a man of action—he is a survivor, not a reformer
That "bringing down the hammer" terrifies him more than it attracts him
That accepting Juan's help might make him a puppet of Castile in truth
D100: Pope Eugenius IV Responds to Juan's Offer to Reform the Camera
The Situation: Juan has offered something extraordinary—to help Eugenius reform the Camera itself. To "bring down the hammer" on the corruption at the heart of papal finance. This is simultaneously exactly what Eugenius needs and exactly what terrifies him most. He has already exposed his vulnerability; now Juan offers to act on it.

Success Factors
Eugenius has already admitted the corruption—the wound is open
Juan has done this before (Castilian reforms) and speaks with authority
The current situation is clearly unsustainable
Eugenius desperately wants to believe reform is possible
Juan asks for nothing in return—disarms suspicion of ulterior motive
The intimacy of this conversation has built genuine trust
Previous roll (93) established deep emotional connection
Failure Factors
Reforming the Camera means making enemies of powerful cardinals
Eugenius has survived by avoiding confrontation, not seeking it
Accepting a foreign king's help reforming the Curia is unprecedented and humiliating
The men who profit from Camera's opacity have destroyed Popes before
Eugenius signed the "temporary transfer" documents—reform exposes him too
"Bringing down the hammer" requires strength Eugenius may not have
The French faction would use this as proof Juan controls the Pope
The Table
1-10: Terror Overwhelms The color drains further from Eugenius's face. He releases the chair and steps back—physically retreating. "You speak of bringing down the hammer. Of forging the Church anew." His voice trembles. "Do you know what you are proposing? The men who control the Camera—they are not clerks, Juan. They are cardinals. Families who have held power in Rome for generations. The Colonna. The Orsini. Men who made Popes and unmade them before We were born." He shakes his head rapidly. "We cannot. We cannot. They would destroy Us. Not through Basel—through knives in the dark, through poison, through a convenient fever that claims Us in Our sleep." He backs toward the door. "We should not have spoken so freely. We should not have admitted—" He stops, collects himself with visible effort. "We thank you for your counsel, King Juan. We must... We must pray on these matters. This audience is concluded."

11-20: Retreat to Safety Eugenius is silent for a long moment. When he speaks, the vulnerability has begun to close over—the Pope reassembling himself around the man. "You offer to help Us reform the Camera. To bring down the hammer, as you say." His voice is careful now, measured. "And what would Christendom see? A Pope so weak he requires a foreign king to discipline his own household. A Pope who cannot manage his own treasury without Castilian oversight." He straightens. "We are grateful for your faith in Us, King Juan. Truly. But there are things a Pope must do alone, or not at all. The Camera is Our responsibility. Our burden. Our sin to confess and Our mess to clean." He moves toward his chair, sits with recovered dignity. "Let Us speak instead of Constantinople. Of the reforms. Of matters where Castile's strength can aid the Church without... complications."

21-35: Fearful Hesitation "Reform the Camera." Eugenius repeats the words as if testing their weight. "Together." He sinks into his chair, suddenly looking older. "You make it sound simple. Pull them into the light. Find out what is really happening. Forge the Church anew." A long pause. "Do you know how many men have tried to reform the Curia, King Juan? How many have been destroyed by it? The Camera is not a treasury—it is a web. Every thread connects to powerful men who will fight to preserve their place in it." His hands grip the chair arms. "We want what you describe. God knows We want it. But We are not... We have never been..." He struggles for words. "We survived Avignon. We survived the Schism. We survived by knowing when to bend, when to wait, when to let storms pass. What you propose is not waiting. It is war." His eyes meet Juan's, and there is fear in them. "We do not know if We have the strength for war."

36-50: Conflicted Interest Eugenius rises, paces to the window, paces back. His movements are agitated, a man wrestling with himself. "You have done this before, you say. In Castile. Brought down the hammer on corruption. Reformed your treasury." He stops, faces Juan. "And what did it cost you? How many enemies did you make? How many men who once supported you became obstacles?" He doesn't wait for an answer. "We have so few allies already. Basel presses from without. The Colonna threaten from within. The French whisper against Us in every court. If We now turn on the very cardinals who have remained loyal—even if their loyalty is purchased with Camera funds—what then?" He spreads his hands. "We are not saying no. We are saying... We need to understand what We would be choosing. And what We would be sacrificing. Walk Us through it, King Juan. Not principles—specifics. How did you reform Castile's treasury? What did it actually require?"

51-65: Cautious Acceptance Eugenius is quiet for a long time. He moves to the window, looks out over Rome, and when he speaks, his voice is distant. "When We were young—before We became what We are now—We had a confessor. An old Augustinian. He told Us once that every man faces a moment when God asks him to choose between comfort and righteousness. Most men, he said, choose comfort and tell themselves they are being prudent." He turns back to Juan. "We have been prudent for three years. We have survived. And the Church has rotted around Us while We survived." A long breath. "Perhaps it is time to stop being prudent." He returns to his chair, sits, and something has changed in his bearing—not confidence exactly, but resolution. "We cannot do this alone. We know that now. If you are offering to help Us—truly help Us, not merely advise from a safe distance—then We accept. But We must know: what does 'bringing down the hammer' actually look like? Where do we begin?"

66-80: Growing Resolve Something shifts in Eugenius's expression. The fear doesn't disappear, but it is joined by something else—anger, perhaps, long suppressed. "You say we already know the answer. That the Camera has been bleeding money. That men have been profiting." His voice hardens. "Yes. We know. We have known for years. We have told Ourselves We were too weak to act, too threatened from without to risk enemies within." He stands straighter. "Perhaps We have been a coward, Juan of Castile. Perhaps survival has become an excuse for abdication." He moves closer. "You completed the Reconquista. You reformed your treasury. You did not wait for perfect conditions—you acted." His eyes are brighter now, not with tears but with something fiercer. "Teach Us. Show Us how you brought down the hammer in Castile. We will need allies in the Curia—there are honest men, a few—and We will need protection from the consequences. Can Castile provide this? Not soldiers in Rome, but... backing. The knowledge that if they move against Us, they move against you as well."

81-90: Embracing the Challenge Eugenius laughs—a strange sound, sharp and sudden, surprising even himself. "Bring down the hammer. Reform the Camera. Pull the corruption into the light." He shakes his head, but he is almost smiling. "Do you know, We have dreamed of this? In the darkest hours, when We could not sleep for shame, We have imagined standing before the Curia and demanding an accounting. Watching the guilty squirm. Cleaning the rot from Peter's house." His expression sobers. "We always told Ourselves it was impossible. That We were too weak, too threatened, too alone." He looks at Juan directly. "We are still weak. Still threatened. But perhaps no longer alone." He extends his hand—not for the ring to be kissed, but to clasp Juan's arm as an equal. "Help Us do this, Juan of Castile. Help Us become the Pope We should have been from the beginning. We will need your counsel, your experience, your strength. And yes—We will need the knowledge that Castile stands with Us when the powerful men of the Curia realize what We intend."

91-100: Transformation Eugenius closes his eyes. For a long moment he stands motionless, and Juan cannot tell if he is praying or simply gathering himself. When he opens his eyes, something has changed. The fear is still there—but beneath it, rising through it, is something that looks almost like joy. "You speak of bringing down the hammer as gracious and beautiful work. As giving purpose." His voice is thick. "We had forgotten that reform could be joyful. That cleaning corruption could be an act of worship, not just punishment." He moves to Juan, takes both his hands. "Three years We have been Pope. Three years of defense, of survival, of watching the Church crumble while We told Ourselves We were preserving what remained. You offer Us something different. Something We did not dare to hope for." His grip tightens. "We accept. Not reluctantly—gratefully. Help Us reform the Camera. Help Us discover where the money has gone, who has taken it, how to stop the bleeding. And yes, help Us find out what remains of your crusade treasury—even if the answer damns Us." He releases Juan's hands but holds his gaze. "We will need to move carefully. There are men who will kill to preserve their corruption. But We will move. Together. In the image of our Lord, as you say." A pause, and something like wonder crosses his face. "We had forgotten what hope feels like, Juan of Castile. We thank you for reminding Us."

Shall I roll, or do you have a d100 ready?

Calibrated character arc toward resolve while preserving agency





The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Something shifts in Eugenius's expression.

The fear doesn't disappear—it remains there, in the tightness around his eyes, in the way his hands grip the chair. But it is joined now by something else. Something older and harder. Anger, perhaps. Long suppressed, finally finding its voice.

"You say we already know the answer. That the Camera has been bleeding money. That men have been profiting while the Church withers."

His voice has changed. Lower. Rougher.

"Yes. We know. We have known, Juan of Castile. For three years We have known. We have watched cardinals build palaces while parishes crumble. We have signed 'temporary transfer' documents and pretended not to understand what they truly meant. We have told Ourselves We were too weak to act, too threatened from without to risk making enemies within."

He rises from his chair. Not with the careful movements of an exhausted man now—with something sharper.

"Perhaps We have been a coward."

The word hangs in the air. A Pope calling himself a coward in front of a foreign king.

"Perhaps survival has become an excuse for abdication. Perhaps We have confused prudence with paralysis." He moves closer to Juan, his deep-set eyes burning with something that might be shame transformed into resolve. "You completed the Reconquista. Seven centuries of work finished in two years. You reformed your treasury—you say you have done this before. You did not wait for perfect conditions. You did not tell yourself the time was not right. You acted."

He stops an arm's length from Juan.

"Teach Us."

The words come out like a confession.

"Show Us how you brought down the hammer in Castile. We are not... We have never been a man of action. We survived Avignon. We survived the Schism. We survived by bending, by waiting, by letting storms pass over Us. But you—" He gestures at Juan. "You do not wait for storms to pass. You ride into them."

His voice drops.

"We will need allies. There are honest men in the Curia—a few. Cardinals who have watched the corruption and despaired as We have despaired. We will need to find them, cultivate them, bring them into this... this hammer of yours." He pauses. "And We will need protection."

His eyes search Juan's face.

"Not soldiers in Rome. That would destroy Us faster than the corruption ever could. But backing. The knowledge—spread quietly through the right channels—that if certain powerful men move against Us, they move against Castile as well. Against the king who completed the Reconquista. Against 600 knights who could become 6,000 if provoked."

He reaches out, grips Juan's arm.

"Can you give Us this? Not troops, not gold—just the shadow of strength behind Us. The suggestion that destroying this Pope would be... costly."

Father, you will find that when you walk the right path, much becomes possible. I can pledge all the crowns I command in your defence without reservation or hesitation. And I know that my fellow king and emperor of the holy roman empire feels the same way. This gives you all the power and military backing you would need to push through the reform. 

But father, have we now identified that you or not even the papacy opposes reforms. But rather the camera and corrupt cardinals are the real enemy? This is important.

8 dec 2025

Analyzed pivotal reframing moment testing Eugenius's resolve against institutional corruption






The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius is still.

Juan's question hangs in the air between them—simple, direct, and devastating in its implications. The Pope's grip on Juan's arm loosens. He steps back, turns away, moves to the window. For a long moment he stands there, silhouetted against the pale March light, his thin shoulders rigid beneath the white robes.

When he speaks, his voice is barely above a whisper.

"You ask Us to say it plainly. To name the enemy."

A long breath.

"For three years We have told Ourselves the enemy was Basel. The Council. The conciliarists who would reduce the Pope to a figurehead. We have fought them. Resisted them. Spent every waking hour defending papal authority against their attacks." He turns, and his face is haunted. "And all the while, the true rot was here. In Rome. In the Camera. In Our own household."

He moves back toward Juan, slowly, as if each step costs him something.

"The reformers at Basel—most of them—they do not hate the Church. They hate what the Church has become. They see cardinals living like princes while parishes lack priests. They see fees and taxes flowing to Rome and disappearing into... what? Banquets. Palaces. Courtesans." His voice cracks slightly. "They are not wrong to be angry. Their solution is wrong—councils cannot govern the Church—but their anger is righteous."

He stops before Juan.

"You ask if the Camera and corrupt cardinals are the real enemy." A pause. His jaw tightens. "Yes. God help Us, yes. The men who have turned Peter's treasury into their personal wealth. The families who have treated the Curia as their inheritance. The officials who have made the Church's finances so opaque that even the Pope cannot trace where the money flows."

His voice drops lower.

"Some of them elected Us. Some of them kept Us alive when the Colonna threatened. Some of them We have called friends." He meets Juan's eyes. "They will not surrender their corruption quietly. They will fight. They will call Us ungrateful, or mad, or controlled by foreign powers. They will whisper to Basel that We have become a tyrant. They will whisper to France that Castile has purchased the papacy."

A long silence.

"But yes. They are the enemy. The true enemy. And We have been too blind—or too frightened—to see it until you forced Us to speak it aloud."

He grips Juan's arm again, and there is something desperate in it.

"You pledge Castile's crowns in Our defense. You speak of Sigismund feeling the same. But tell Us truly, Juan of Castile—" His voice is raw. "When the hammer falls, when the powerful men of the Curia realize what We intend, when they begin their counterattack... will you still stand with Us? Even if they make it costly? Even if they turn all of Europe against the Pope who dared to clean his own house?"

We know what we have to do. But we fear consequence if we do what we must. We may die. We may suffer. Any number of things can happen. And we can turn to scripture in these instances. What does the gospel preach when we can act righteously but have fears and doubts? What would any priest tell us in this situation? What would Jezus have done?

8 dec 2025

Examined spiritual confrontation between faith and fear through scripture










The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius freezes.

The question strikes him like a physical blow. His mouth opens, closes. His hand falls away from Juan's arm. He stands there, the Pope of Rome, the Vicar of Christ—and a king has just asked him what scripture teaches about fear.

For a long moment, he cannot speak.

Then, slowly, he begins to laugh. Not joyful laughter—something rougher, more painful. The laughter of a man confronting his own absurdity.

"You ask Us—" He shakes his head, the laughter fading into something raw. "You ask the Pope what the Gospel preaches. What Jesus would do." His voice breaks. "We have spent three years hiding behind theology while forgetting the first lesson Christ ever taught."

He turns away, moves to the small altar in the corner of the chamber. A crucifix hangs there—simple, wooden, old. He stares at it.

"Be not afraid." The words come out hoarse. "Three hundred and sixty-five times in scripture. One for every day of the year, the scholars say. As if God knew we would need constant reminding."

His hand reaches out, touches the foot of the cross.

"Fear not, for I am with you. I will strengthen you. I will help you." Isaiah. His voice steadies slightly. "For God gave us not a spirit of fear, but of power and love and self-control."

He turns back to Juan, and there are tears on his face. He does not wipe them away.

"What would Jesus have done?" A broken laugh. "He walked into the Temple and overturned the tables of the money-changers. He did not ask permission. He did not wait for perfect conditions. He did not worry that the Pharisees would call Him dangerous or the Romans would take notice." His voice rises. "He saw corruption in His Father's house, and He drove it out."

He moves back toward Juan, and something has changed in his bearing. The fear is still there—but it has been joined by something stronger.

"Any priest would tell Us what We already know. That faith without works is dead. That the shepherd who fears the wolf more than he loves the sheep is no shepherd at all. That—" His voice catches. "That We have been a coward, hiding behind prudence, while the Church We swore to protect has been devoured from within."

He stands before Juan now, close enough to touch.

"You did not come here to teach Us scripture, King of Castile. You came to make Us remember what We already knew and were too frightened to act upon."

He draws a long, shuddering breath.

"Very well. We remember now."

His chin lifts. His shoulders straighten. And when he speaks again, his voice carries something it has lacked for three years—conviction.

"We will bring down the hammer. We will reform the Camera. We will drag the corruption into the light, whatever the cost. If they kill Us for it, then We will die as a Pope should die—defending Christ's Church, not cowering while others plunder her."

He extends his hand—not for Juan to kiss, but to clasp.

"Will you help Us begin? Today? Now? Before Our courage fails Us again?"

The lord provides father. The lord provides. If we enact a powerful review of the camera and of church finances, this would create a decree impossible for Basel not to pass. Include wording about enforcement mechanisms that will allow you access into France. They will have no recourse at all. This will reform the church and restore Rome's authority extremely powerfully. This is the way. 

But first. Security. Are we safe where we are right now? If they learn about our intent, can they move to threaten or capture us?

8 dec 2025

Weighed immediate Vatican security threats and loyalty uncertainties








The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

The question cuts through Eugenius's rising fervor like cold water.

He stops. Blinks. The fire in his eyes dims—not extinguished, but banked by sudden practical fear. He looks around the chamber as if seeing it for the first time. The tapestries on the walls. The door through which Capranica and the secretary departed. The windows overlooking Rome.

"Safe," he repeats quietly. His voice has changed again—still resolved, but tempered now with the survival instincts that have kept him alive this long.

He moves closer to Juan, drops his voice to barely above a whisper.

"This chamber is... reasonably secure. We use it for private audiences precisely because it has fewer servants' passages than the formal halls. But—" He glances at the door. "Cardinal Capranica heard much before We dismissed him. He is loyal, We believe. One of the few. But his household talks to other households. And the secretary..."

His jaw tightens.

"The secretary is Camera-appointed. Not Ours. He reports to Cardinal Condulmer—Our cousin, yes, but also a man with his own interests in how Camera funds flow."

He begins to pace, but tightly now, controlled.

"If we speak of this openly—if We summon Camera officials and demand accountings without preparation—word will spread within hours. The men who have profited will know before sunset. They have had decades to build their networks. We have had three years of... of not looking too closely."

He stops, faces Juan.

"Your knights. The 591 at their billets. How quickly could they reach the Vatican if summoned?"

A pause.

"We do not ask because We intend violence. We ask because We need to know what options exist if..." He trails off, unwilling to finish the sentence.

His eyes move to the door again.

"Capranica. We must speak with him. Carefully. He has argued for reform before—quietly, knowing We were not ready to hear it. If he can be trusted..." Another pause. "And there are others. Cardinal Albergati. Perhaps Bishop Parentucelli in the Curia. Men who have whispered their disgust to Us in private moments."

He looks back at Juan.

"But you are right to ask about security first. We have been a fool once today already—letting emotion carry Us forward without thought. Before We bring down any hammers, We must know who holds the handles of the ones that might fall on Us."

His voice drops lower still.

"What would you advise, King Juan? You have done this before. When you moved against corruption in Castile—how did you protect yourself in those first critical hours?"

My situation was a bit different. I want on pilgrimage and it suited my situation well. 

My knights are at your dispopsal and can summon them right now is we want. 

What about the men in your palace? Are they loyal to you, or loyal to someone else?

8 dec 2025

Weighed Eugenius's precarious household loyalty and control vulnerabilities








The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius's face goes very still.

It is the stillness of a man confronting a question he has spent three years avoiding. He does not answer immediately. Instead, he moves to the door—not to open it, but to press his ear against it for a moment. Listening. Then he returns, closer to Juan than before, his voice barely a breath.

"The Papal Guard." He speaks the words like a confession. "Two hundred men. Their captain is... We appointed him Ourselves. Giacomo Pallavicini. Genoese. He owes nothing to the Roman families. We believe—" He stops. "Believe. Not know. We believe he is loyal."

His hands clasp and unclasp.

"The household servants. Perhaps sixty. Most were here before Us. They served Martin V, Gregory XII before him—passed down like furniture from Pope to Pope. We know their faces. We do not know their hearts." A pause. "Some certainly report to cardinals. The Colonna have eyes everywhere in Rome—it would be strange if they had none in the Vatican itself. The Orsini as well."

He moves to the window, glances out as if checking for watchers, then turns back.

"The secretaries. The notaries. The Camera officials who handle documents, who control access, who know which doors are locked and which are open." His voice is bitter. "These We did not appoint. These came with the office. They have served the Camera longer than any Pope has sat on Peter's throne. Their loyalty is to the institution—and the institution has been captured by the men who profit from it."

He spreads his hands—a gesture of helplessness that contradicts the resolve he showed moments ago.

"You ask if they are loyal to Us or to someone else. The honest answer: We do not know. We have never tested them. We have never dared to test them, because testing them would reveal Our suspicions, and revealing Our suspicions would—"

He stops. Swallows.

"Would make Us vulnerable. As We are now. As We have made Ourselves by speaking so freely with you."

His eyes meet Juan's.

"If word of this conversation reaches the wrong ears before we are ready to act... if they learn that the Pope intends to audit the Camera, to demand accountings, to drag corruption into the light..."

He does not finish the sentence. He does not need to.

"Your knights. You say they are at Our disposal." His voice drops even lower. "How many would it take to secure this palace? Not to hold it against an army—just to ensure that no one leaves to carry messages until We are ready. An hour. Perhaps two. Long enough to summon the men We trust and dismiss the ones We do not."

I could summon all my knights here and expel those we do not trust. It provides us safety on our person. I will have to move in my household as well. I cannot protect them otherwise. 

But in my experience, it is extremely important that we publicly and openly announce what we plan to do. Drag into the light that which was in darkness. This will create new enemies, but will create even more allies as well. Personally, I usually give a speech before thousands. But that is me. You can do the same or declare your intentions in another way that is more aligned with your personality. Either way, we must say to the world: Here we are. And we are not afraid. 

Lets think strategically. If we declare all existing camera arrangements null and void and will build up papal finances from the ground up, what would our enemies do first? Will they secure the camera and it's treasury itself? Will they raise armies? What do you think?

Strategized enemy responses to financial reform announcement






The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius begins to pace again—but differently now. This is not the restless movement of fear. This is a man thinking, drawing on decades of watching Rome's powerful families maneuver.

"The Camera's treasury." He shakes his head. "It is not a chest of gold sitting in a vault, Juan. It is... dispersed. Claims. Debts owed. Revenues promised from benefices across Christendom. Letters of credit held by Florentine and Venetian banks. The actual coin in Rome at any moment is perhaps—" He pauses, calculating. "Perhaps fifty thousand florins? Less? We do not know precisely. That is part of the problem."

He stops by the window, staring out but not seeing.

"If we announce our intentions publicly, what would they do first?" He turns back. "The documents. They would secure the documents before anything else. The ledgers. The account books. The records of who received what and when and why. Without those, we cannot prove corruption—we can only allege it. And allegations against cardinals without proof..." He shakes his head grimly. "That is how Popes get called tyrants. That is how Basel gains ammunition."

He resumes pacing.

"The treasury itself—what coin exists—yes, they would move it. Quietly. Into private accounts, family holdings, anywhere beyond Our reach. By the time We sent men to secure it, the vaults would hold nothing but dust and excuses."

His voice darkens.

"Armies? No. Not immediately. The Roman families keep retainers, not armies. The Colonna perhaps two thousand men scattered across their holdings. The Orsini fewer. They would not march on the Vatican—not openly. That would turn all Christendom against them." He pauses. "But accidents happen to Popes, Juan. Fevers. Falls. Tainted food. A trusted servant who is not so trusted after all."

He stops, faces Juan directly.

"Their first move would be political, not military. They would send messengers to Basel within the hour—to Cardinal d'Allemand, to the French faction. Proof, they would say, that Eugenius has gone mad. That he has fallen under the control of a foreign king. That he threatens the liberty of the Church." His lip curls. "They would wrap their corruption in the language of reform. They would make Us the tyrant for daring to ask where the money went."

He moves closer.

"So. If we do this—if we truly do this—we must move faster than they can. Secure the documents before they can be destroyed or hidden. Control the messengers before word can reach Basel. And yes, announce our intentions publicly, loudly, so that all of Christendom hears our version before their whispers can poison the well."

His eyes narrow, thinking.

"The Camera's offices are in the Apostolic Palace. A separate wing. Perhaps thirty clerks and officials work there during the day. At night..." He pauses. "At night there are guards. Camera guards. Not Papal Guard—their own men."

He looks at Juan.

"Your knights. How quickly can they truly be here? And when they arrive—are they prepared to secure a building full of documents against men who may resist? Not with swords necessarily, but with locked doors and burned ledgers and convenient fires?"

NPC RULES:
- NPC has their own agenda. They steer the conversation toward it.
- NPC does not explain themselves. Juan must figure them out.
- NPC does not help Juan without getting something first.
I (the player) am SATISFIED when NPCs are unhelpful to Juan. Cooperative NPCs are a failure.
Before NPC dialogue, answer: What does this NPC want? What won't they say?
Remember to never generate dialogue or action for Juan. Instead, just stop.

They can and will do so. My knights are at your disposal. 
But is it not popssible to secure the camera itself and secure it with my knights? That would be maybe better then moving all the documents here. 

I can summon them here and let them swear an oath of allegiance to your person. They are devout and faithful christians and will keep their oath. This also creates legitimacy for what they are about to do. They will no longer be Castillian knights, it will be servants of the pope himself securing the interests of the church. 

And can the pope act on it's own accord? Or does papal authority depend on a vatican council of sorts? Can you theoretically summon a scribe and issue a papal decree by yourself?

Analyzed NPC motivations and crafted strategically evasive response






NPC Analysis: Pope Eugenius IV

What does Eugenius want?

To ensure he maintains control of this process—not become Juan's puppet
To understand if this plan actually works legally and practically
Reassurance that he won't be seen as a foreign king's tool
To protect himself while appearing to lead
What won't he say?

That Castilian knights swearing allegiance to him personally makes him nervous
That once Juan's men control the Camera, Juan effectively controls papal finances
His uncertainty about whether he can actually issue decrees without curial support
That some "loyal" cardinals may abandon him when the hammer actually falls
His fear that he's trading one form of dependence for another
The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius listens carefully. When Juan finishes, he does not answer immediately. His eyes flicker—calculating, assessing. The survival instincts of three years have not entirely given way to newfound resolve.

"Secure the Camera building itself. Yes." He nods slowly. "That is... cleaner. The documents remain where they are. We control access. No one enters or leaves without Our permission." A pause. "The Camera offices are not large. Perhaps your knights could hold them with—fifty men? A hundred? Enough to guard every door and window, enough to prevent accidents with candles and parchment."

He moves to a small writing desk in the corner of the chamber, touches it absently.

"Your knights swearing allegiance to Our person." His voice is more careful now. Measured. "This creates legitimacy, yes. They become servants of the Church, not a foreign army occupying the Vatican." He turns back to Juan. "But it also creates... questions. Six hundred Castilian knights, sworn to the Pope, holding the Camera. Cardinal d'Allemand will say We have sold the papacy to Spain. The French will claim—"

He stops himself. Shakes his head.

"No. You are right. We cannot let fear of what enemies will say prevent Us from acting. They will say what they will say regardless. Better to act righteously and be slandered than to cower and be despised."

He straightens, and something of the resolve returns.

"As for papal authority—" He moves back toward Juan. "This is... complex. In principle, the Pope's authority is supreme and immediate. We can issue decrees, bulls, constitutions by Our own hand. The keys of Peter are Ours. No council, no consistory, no cardinal can legally prevent Us from exercising Our office."

His expression darkens.

"In principle. In practice..." He spreads his hands. "Major decrees are traditionally discussed in consistory—the assembly of cardinals. Not because We require their permission, but because issuing significant legislation without consultation appears tyrannical. It gives ammunition to Basel's claims that We are an autocrat who ignores the counsel of the Church."

He pauses, thinking.

"However. There are precedents for urgent action. Motu proprio—by Our own initiative. When circumstances demand immediate response, the Pope may act alone and seek ratification afterward." His eyes meet Juan's. "We could summon a scribe. We could issue a decree establishing a commission to audit the Camera's finances. We could do it now, this hour, with only you as witness."

He hesitates.

"But such a decree, issued in secret, acted upon by foreign knights before the cardinals even know it exists..." He shakes his head slowly. "The legality would be unquestionable. The legitimacy—in the eyes of Christendom—that is another matter. We would need to announce it publicly almost immediately. Explain why urgency required extraordinary measures. Frame it as reform, not seizure."

He looks at Juan directly.

"You spoke of giving a speech before thousands. Of dragging into light what was in darkness." A long pause. "If We do this—secure the Camera tonight, issue the decree, present the world with accomplished fact—We will need to speak to Rome tomorrow. To the cardinals. To the people. We will need to explain Ourselves in a way that makes Us reformers, not tyrants."

His voice drops.

"We have never been a man for speeches, Juan of Castile. We have survived by being quiet, by being cautious, by letting others speak while We listened." Something flickers in his eyes—fear, but also something else. Challenge, perhaps. Or desperate hope.

"Will you help Us find the words?"

I could help you write a speech or adress that you can deliver in person to the public. 

But a question first. If you summon this assembly of cardinals. Is this essentially the enemy we have been speaking of? Will they oppose what we are discussing? How great is this group of cardinals?

8 dec 2025

Weighed papal isolation against cardinalate loyalty and factional divisions









The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius exhales slowly. The question has forced him to confront something he has been avoiding—taking a true inventory of his own princes of the Church.

"The College of Cardinals." He moves to his chair, sits heavily. "Twenty-four men currently hold the red hat. Some are here in Rome. Some at Basel. Some scattered across their dioceses or on various missions."

He begins to count on his fingers, his voice dropping lower.

"In Rome, at this moment? Perhaps... fourteen. Fifteen." He pauses. "Of those—"

His jaw tightens.

"The Roman families first. Prospero Colonna. Giordano Orsini—yes, the same Orsini who was so cold to your Fray Hernando. His loyalty is to his family first, the Church second, and Us a distant third. These men have nephews and cousins throughout the Camera. They have built the system we seek to reform. They will oppose us absolutely."

He raises another finger.

"The French. Cardinal Jean de Rochetaillée is here, watching everything for d'Allemand in Basel. Anything discussed in consistory reaches Basel within a week. He will frame any reform as tyranny, any audit as persecution."

Another finger.

"Then there are those who are simply... comfortable. Cardinals who have grown fat on the current arrangements. Who have benefices in three countries, households of fifty servants, palaces that rival princes. They may not actively conspire, but they will not welcome anyone examining how they live."

He falls silent for a moment. His hands drop to his lap.

"Allies." The word comes out strained. "Capranica—you met him at Mass. He has whispered of reform before. Albergati, perhaps. He is old, devout, genuinely troubled by what he sees. Parentucelli is not yet a cardinal, but he is influential in the Curia and honest—We think."

He looks up at Juan.

"Three. Perhaps four. Out of twenty-four." A bitter laugh escapes him. "And even these—We do not know how they will respond when the hammer actually falls. It is easy to whisper of reform in private. It is another thing to stand beside a Pope who has just seized the Camera with foreign knights."

He spreads his hands.

"So yes. If We summon a formal consistory to discuss this, We are summoning the enemy to vote on their own destruction. They will delay. They will demand procedures, consultations, committees. They will bury reform in process until Our resolve weakens or Our health fails."

His voice hardens.

"This is why We spoke of motu proprio. Of acting first and explaining after. The consistory exists to advise Us—not to command Us. We are not required to seek their permission." A pause. "But acting without them, against them, while foreign soldiers hold the Camera..."

He trails off, the implications hanging in the air.

"You see Our dilemma, King Juan. Move through proper channels, and the corrupt cardinals will strangle reform in its cradle. Move around them, and We hand Basel exactly the evidence they need to call Us a tyrant controlled by Spain."

His eyes search Juan's face.

"How did you manage this in Castile? Your nobles, your councils—how did you reform without giving your enemies the weapons to destroy you?"

Being right. Being on the side of good is the most powerful weapon there is father. Do not be afraid to wield it. 

We should do a few things. We should write our decree in secret. And then summon as large an audience as we can and announce this decree under motu proprio. Combine it with signing the Basel reforms on pluralism and concubinage and the reform of the annates as well. We ask for the Basel council to pass the Camera reforms as well in the same way as we have affirmed their legislation regarding pluralism and the others. The council will pass these reforms. 

Secondly, we send out corespondance to christian monarchs asking for support against anyone moving against the pope and the reforms he is justly seeking. Castille, Aragon, Naples, Portugal and the holy roman empire will do so I think. 

Then, we replace my men with your own Italian loyal soldiers. Men who we can select and vet ourselves. And we start to expose, reform and gain control of the camera. Using just honest and good men to do so.

Weighed papal concerns against Juan's ambitious reform strategy







The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius listens intently, his fingers steepled beneath his chin. As Juan speaks, something shifts in his posture—the hunched wariness of a cornered man slowly giving way to something more upright. More like a Pope.

But when Juan finishes, Eugenius does not immediately agree. His eyes narrow, thinking.

"The structure is sound," he says slowly. "Write in secret. Announce publicly. Combine our Camera reform with signing Basel's decrees—yes, this is clever. It makes Us appear as a reforming Pope, not a desperate one. It forces Basel to either support Us or reveal themselves as hypocrites who want reform only when it weakens Rome."

He rises, moves to the window, speaks with his back turned.

"Castile. Aragón. Naples. Portugal. The Empire." He lists the names carefully. "You believe these crowns will support Us. Perhaps you are right. Sigismund owes Us nothing, but he fears Basel more than he fears a strong Pope. Alfonso wants Naples recognized. Portugal follows where Castile leads."

He turns back, and his expression has sharpened.

"But you did not name France."

The word hangs in the air.

"The French crown will not support this. They benefit from a weak papacy. They shelter their clergy behind the Pragmatic Sanction. Their cardinals lead the radical faction at Basel." His voice is flat. "When We announce these reforms, when We sign Basel's decrees and demand the Council pass Ours—France will see it as a threat. Not to corruption, but to French influence over the Church."

He moves closer to Juan.

"And the annates." His jaw tightens. "You include the annates reform in what We should sign. Do you understand what that decree does? It reduces papal revenues from benefices by three-quarters. The Camera is already bleeding. If We sign that decree and enforce it honestly—" He spreads his hands. "How do We pay for anything? The Papal Guard. The Curia. The maintenance of the Papal States. How do We even pay for the loyal Italian soldiers you speak of replacing your knights with?"

He is not refusing. His tone is not hostile. But he is pushing back—testing the plan, looking for weaknesses.

"And these loyal Italians." A pause. "Where do they come from? The Roman families control most of the armed men in the city. The Papal Guard is small—two hundred men—and even there, We cannot vouch for every soldier. If We dismiss your knights before we have trustworthy replacements..." He shakes his head. "We would be defenseless at the moment of greatest danger."

He stops before Juan, close enough to touch.

"We are not refusing, King Juan. We are asking you to think through these questions with Us. You have done this before—you know that the devil lives in the details."

His voice drops.

"The annates. France. The soldiers. These are the rocks upon which this plan could founder. How do We navigate them?"

The annates are not the problem. The camera is bleeding funds because they are incorrectly allocated. Not because they do not collect enough. Even if we double the annates and every church in christianity pays this amount, we would be in the same situation. These cardinals will continue to feed on the camera. As long as we do not adress this problem, we will never have enough money. 

We have fifty thousand florins in cash. This should be enough to consolidate your power base here. Are you telling me the annates in the Basel decree are not enough to cover the scribes and other just costs the papacy has?

8 dec 2025

Dissected Juan's argument, identified Eugenius's vulnerabilities and fears







The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius opens his mouth to respond—then closes it.

He stands very still for a long moment. The sharpness in his eyes fades, replaced by something more uncomfortable. The look of a man who has just been caught in his own deflection.

"You are right."

The words come out quietly. He turns away, moves to the window, presses his palm against the cold stone of the frame.

"We raised the annates as an objection because... because it was easier than facing the true question." A long pause. "The truth is We do not know what legitimate papal expenses actually are. We do not know what it costs to run the Curia honestly, because the Curia has not been run honestly in living memory."

He turns back, and there is something raw in his face.

"They give Us reports. The Camera officials. Beautiful documents, detailed ledgers, impressive numbers. And We sign them and We do not ask questions because—" His voice catches. "Because asking questions would reveal how little We understand. How completely they have kept Us in darkness about Our own treasury."

He moves back toward Juan, his steps slower now.

"Fifty thousand florins. You say it should be enough to consolidate power. Perhaps you are right. We do not know. We do not know what the Papal Guard truly costs, what the scribes and notaries require, what is necessary and what is excess." His hands spread helplessly. "This is the depth of Our failure, Juan. We have been Pope for three years and We cannot tell you what it costs to be Pope."

He sinks into his chair.

"The cardinals. Their palaces. Their households. Their banquets and mistresses and armies of servants." His voice hardens. "These are not legitimate expenses. These are parasites feeding on the body of the Church. You are right—even if We doubled revenues, they would simply take more."

He looks up at Juan.

"So. The annates are not the problem. The allocation is the problem. The men who control the allocation are the problem." A pause. "And We have been using their objections as Our own, because We were too frightened to see clearly."

His jaw sets.

"What of France, then? This objection We will not surrender so easily. The French crown will oppose us. Their cardinals will carry word to Basel. How do we prevent them from poisoning this reform before it can take root?"

This is what I think will happen. If we pass these reforms and our own decree reforming the camera, it will pass in Basel. France cannot choose to then ignore these decrees without a massive loss of face. They have been proposing the authority of Basel. If they invalidate Rome's decree after it has been affirmed by Basel, it invalidates their entire position. They would alienate themselves. And honestly, I think most of the french delegates would be on our side. 

If France chooses to oppose Rome in regards to annates, by what authority? They can delay, but after Basel approves our reform, they will have no real power. It may take some years, but in the end, they should be paying like everybody else. Especially if you grant the French king attention and good relations. France is a very powerful kingdom. Maybe the most powerful in christianity and it is only natural we treat them as such. Ally yourself to the French king. And you will find that having an ally may work wonders.

Weighed Juan's French strategy logic and Eugenius's diplomatic concerns







The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius is quiet for a long moment. His fingers tap against the arm of his chair—once, twice, three times. Then they stop.

"The logic is sound," he admits slowly. "If Basel affirms Our decree on the Camera, the French cannot reject it without rejecting conciliar authority itself. They would be arguing that councils are supreme only when they agree with France." A thin, mirthless smile. "Even d'Allemand would struggle to make that case with a straight face."

He rises, moves restlessly, thinking aloud.

"But you speak of allying with the French king. Of granting him attention and good relations." He turns to face Juan. "Charles VII sits on a throne We helped him keep. We recognized his coronation when the English called him a bastard and a pretender. And how has he repaid Us? With the Pragmatic Sanction. With bishops who ignore Our legates. With cardinals who work to make Us a figurehead."

His voice carries old bitterness—wounds nursed over years.

"We have tried to treat France as the great power it is. We have been rebuffed. Ignored. Treated as an obstacle to French ambitions rather than a partner." He spreads his hands. "You make it sound simple—ally with the French king. But Charles listens to his counselors, and his counselors benefit from a weak papacy. Why would he choose friendship with Rome when enmity costs him nothing?"

He stops, looks at Juan directly.

"You are King of Castile. You have dealt with monarchs, negotiated alliances, balanced powers against one another." A pause. "What does France want that We could offer? What would make Charles VII see value in a strong Pope rather than a weak one?"

His eyes narrow slightly.

"And—speak frankly—what does Castile's relationship with France look like? Are you enemies? Rivals? Could you serve as... intermediary? Or would French suspicion of Spanish influence make Our situation worse?"

Ha! I must confess I do not concern myself much with French politics. I was not informed about your recent relations with the French and their betrayal of trust. 

France will do to an extent what it will. They can in theory install a French anti-pope at any time. 

But the French clergymen all know they are part of the catholic church. If a just and fair decree has been passed, most will follow it. Do not underestimate this. If they indeed have a tradition of not paying Rome, it may take some time to reverse this. But I believe in time, it will. Make any future involvement with them conditional of recognizing these decrees. Kings always need papal recognition sooner or later. And what you are asking is not unreasonable.

8 dec 2025

Analyzed character motivation and orchestrated transition toward decisive action






The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius lets out a breath—something between a laugh and a sigh.

"You do not concern yourself much with French politics." He shakes his head, but there is something almost like affection in it. "Perhaps that is wisdom. We have spent three years concerning Ourselves with French politics, and what has it gained Us? Sleepless nights and a cardinal who reports Our every word to Basel."

He moves back to his chair but does not sit. His hand rests on its back, fingers drumming softly.

"You are right, of course. French clergymen know they are Catholic. They confess. They celebrate Mass. They look to Rome for dispensations and appeals and the thousand small matters that require papal authority." A pause. "They may resent paying, but they cannot pretend We do not exist. Not forever."

He straightens, and something has settled in his bearing. A decision taking shape.

"So. We do not solve France today. We act justly, We pass Our reforms, We let Basel affirm them—and We trust that time and pressure will do what argument cannot." His voice is firmer now. "This is... acceptable. We have spent too long trying to solve every problem before taking any step. Perhaps that is how one remains frozen forever."

He turns to face Juan fully.

"Then let Us speak of what We do control. Here. Now. Tonight."

He begins to pace again, but purposefully—a man organizing his thoughts.

"First. The decree. We must write it before We leave this room. You and We, together. The language must be precise—establishing a commission to audit the Camera's finances, with authority to examine all records, question all officials, and report directly to Us." He glances at Juan. "You have done this before. You will help Us find the right words."

A second point, raised on his fingers.

"Second. Your knights. When do they move? We must secure the Camera offices before word spreads of what We intend. Tonight? Tomorrow at dawn? The timing must be exact."

A third finger.

"Third. The announcement. You spoke of addressing thousands. We must decide—where? When? St. Peter's Square? The Basilica itself? And what do We say to make Rome understand this is reform, not tyranny?"

He stops, faces Juan.

"Fourth. The letters to Christian monarchs. These must go out simultaneously with the announcement—or even before. Castile, Aragón, Portugal, the Empire. We must have their support publicly declared before Our enemies can frame the narrative."

His eyes meet Juan's, and there is something new in them. Not quite confidence—but the ghost of it. The memory of what confidence feels like.

"We have talked enough, King Juan. Talked until We have nearly lost Our nerve three times over." A thin smile. "Let Us begin. What words should this decree contain?"

Then it is time to expand the circle we have. We need scribes we can trust. And maybe Capranica if we choose to trust him. Do you think we can?

8 dec 2025

Weighed NPC motivations and crafted strategically evasive response






The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius pauses. The question is simple, but his answer is not.

He moves to the door—not to open it, but to stand near it, as if Capranica might somehow hear through the heavy wood. When he speaks, his voice is low.

"Domenico Capranica." He says the name carefully, weighing it. "He has served the Church for thirty years. He was denied his cardinal's hat by Martin V—a political slight, nothing to do with his character—and We restored it to him when We became Pope. He has reason to be grateful."

A pause. His fingers trace the grain of the door.

"He has spoken to Us of reform. Quietly. In private moments when no one else could hear. He has expressed... frustration with what he sees. The excess. The corruption. The way the Camera operates beyond anyone's true control." Eugenius turns back to face Juan. "These conversations felt genuine. But—"

His jaw tightens.

"But We have learned that men say many things in private that they do not mean when circumstances change. Capranica has ambitions. He is not a young man, but he is not old either. He may hope to sit in this chair someday." A gesture at the papal throne. "If he believes Our reform will succeed, he will support it—perhaps genuinely, perhaps because he wishes to be seen as a reformer when the next conclave comes. If he believes it will fail..."

He spreads his hands.

"We do not know what he would do. We do not know if his whispered frustrations were conviction or calculation. We have never tested him. We have never dared to test him."

He moves closer to Juan.

"You met him. At Mass. He made himself visible to you deliberately—that was not accident. He sent your queen a careful, noncommittal message." Eugenius's eyes search Juan's face. "What was your impression? You have dealt with men like this before. Cardinals, nobles, counselors who say the right things and wait to see which way the wind blows."

A pause.

"Can we trust him enough to bring him into this room tonight? Or do we write our decree alone and present him with accomplished fact?"

Are there other cardinals or bishops we can trust more?

8 dec 2025

Weighed trustworthiness of potential allies against personal vulnerabilities







The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius is quiet for a moment. Then he moves to the window, staring out at Rome as he speaks.

"We mentioned others earlier. Let Us think on them more carefully."

He raises a finger.

"Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. Carthusian. Old now—nearly seventy. He has lived simply his entire life. No palace, no great household, no mistresses or nephews enriching themselves on Church funds." A pause. "He has been troubled by the corruption for years. We have seen it in his face during consistory—the way he looks away when certain expenditures are approved. He is genuinely devout."

His voice drops.

"But he is old, Juan. And cautious by nature. The Carthusians are contemplatives, not warriors. Albergati has survived by being agreeable, by not making enemies. If We bring him into this room and tell him We intend to bring down the hammer on the Camera tonight—" Eugenius shakes his head. "He might support Us in prayer. We do not know if he would support Us in action. And his health is not strong. The shock alone might..."

He trails off, raises another finger.

"Tommaso Parentucelli. Not a cardinal—not yet—but influential. He serves as secretary to Albergati, in fact. Younger. Brilliant. A scholar who came from nothing and rose through merit alone. He has no family connections to the Roman powers, no income beyond his salary, no reason to protect the current system."

A pause.

"We have spoken with him privately. He burns with quiet fury at what he sees. The waste. The simony. The way talented men are passed over for nephews and favorites." Eugenius turns back to face Juan. "If anyone in the Curia would embrace reform genuinely, it is Parentucelli. But he has no power of his own. No vote in consistory. No troops, no wealth, no family to call upon. He could help Us write the decree—he is a finer Latinist than any scribe—but he cannot protect Us."

A third finger, more reluctantly.

"Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville. French, yes, but not d'Allemand's creature. He has quarreled with the French faction over matters of procedure. He is ambitious—very ambitious—but his ambition runs toward being seen as a statesman, a builder, a man of consequence." Eugenius's expression is uncertain. "He might support reform if he believed it would succeed and he could share the credit. But French... and ambitious. A dangerous combination."

He lets his hand fall.

"So. Albergati is honest but old and timid. Parentucelli is trustworthy but powerless. D'Estouteville is capable but French and self-interested. Capranica is..." He searches for the word. "Capranica is the most useful—connected, respected, energetic—but also the most opaque. We cannot read his true heart."

He looks at Juan directly.

"If We must choose one to bring into this room tonight, who would you choose? Or do We write this decree alone, just the two of Us, and trust no one until the hammer has already fallen?"

Summon Parentucelli. Start with him.

8 dec 2025

Characterized trustworthy reformer, planned summoning scene strategically






The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius nods slowly. "Parentucelli. Yes."

He moves to the door, opens it a crack. The corridor beyond is empty save for a single papal guard at the far end. No sign of Capranica or the secretary—they must have withdrawn further when dismissed.

"Guard."

The man approaches, kneels. "Holy Father."

"Find Tommaso Parentucelli. He will be in Cardinal Albergati's quarters, or in the library. Tell him—" Eugenius pauses, choosing words carefully. "Tell him the Holy Father requires his assistance with a matter of correspondence. Urgent. He is to come alone and speak to no one of the summons."

"At once, Holy Father."

The guard departs. Eugenius closes the door and turns back to Juan.

"It will take perhaps a quarter hour. Albergati's quarters are in the Apostolic Palace, not far." He moves to the writing desk, touches the quill and inkwell there. "While we wait—we should consider what we tell him. How much. How quickly."

He turns.

"Parentucelli is not a fool. He will know the moment he enters this room that something extraordinary is happening. A private audience with the Pope and the King of Castile, summoned in secret, told to speak to no one?" A thin smile. "He will be frightened. He will wonder if this is a test—if someone has accused him of disloyalty and he is being examined."

Eugenius settles into a chair.

"We must put him at ease quickly. And then—" He looks at Juan. "Do we tell him everything? The Camera, the reform, the knights, the decree? Or do we reveal it piece by piece, watching his reactions?"

The fire crackles. Somewhere distant, a church bell marks the hour.

"You have more experience with this than We do, King Juan. How do you take the measure of a man in such moments?"

We tell him everything father. If he is of true heart, he needs to know everything. We need allies. And that starts by being clear to them and later the world about who we are. If he is the man you say he is, then we should have nothing to worry about. 

While we wait; tell me if an examination of the expenditure of the camera would take place, would it uncover corruption? Even corruption on the highest level?

8 dec 2025

Weighed Eugenius's honesty against self-preservation amid corruption exposure






The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius goes still.

The question hangs in the air between them. Simple. Direct. And cutting to the heart of everything they have been discussing.

He does not answer immediately. Instead, he rises, moves to the fire, stares into it. When he speaks, his voice is quiet.

"Yes."

A long pause.

"An honest examination would uncover... much." He does not turn around. "The Camera has operated in shadow for decades. Perhaps longer. Every Pope since Avignon has relied on it, drawn from it, and chosen not to look too closely at how it functions."

His shoulders tighten.

"Cardinals have enriched their families. Offices have been sold. Revenues meant for the maintenance of churches have been diverted to palaces. Funds designated for charitable works have been..." He waves a hand vaguely. "Reallocated. The crusade treasury you deposited—We told you We do not know how much remains. That is true. But We suspect. We suspect it has been touched, despite Our instructions."

He turns now, and his face is drawn.

"Corruption at the highest level. You ask this carefully, Juan of Castile. We understand what you are truly asking." His eyes meet Juan's. "You are asking whether an examination would uncover evidence against Us. Against the Pope himself."

He moves back to his chair, sits heavily.

"We have signed documents. Many documents. Authorizations for transfers, for expenditures, for payments We did not fully understand. We told Ourselves We were delegating to men who knew the Camera's workings better than We did. We told Ourselves it was necessary—that the threats We faced required flexibility, speed, resources." His voice is bitter. "We told Ourselves many things."

A long silence.

"Would an honest examination find that We knowingly stole from the Church? No. We have taken nothing for Ourselves. Our chambers are modest. Our household is small. We have no nephews growing fat on benefices, no mistresses draped in jewels." He spreads his hands, showing their emptiness. "But would it find that We were negligent? That We signed what We should not have signed? That We failed in Our duty to guard the treasury of Peter?"

His jaw tightens.

"Yes. It would find that."

He looks at Juan directly.

"If We bring down this hammer, it may fall on Us as well. Not as a thief—but as a fool. A Pope who let himself be used. Is that a price worth paying? We believe it is. We must believe it is, or We cannot do what must be done."

A pause.

"But you should know this before We proceed. When the Camera's secrets are dragged into the light, some of that light will fall on the chair of Peter. And Our enemies will use it. They will say We reform only to hide Our own sins. They will say the audit is theater, designed to blame others for what We permitted."

His voice drops.

"Can this reform survive that? Can We survive it? These are questions We cannot answer alone."

It will father. And dont worry too much about this. If we pass reform it may for a moment seem like everything is against us, but soon, everyone will be on our side if we truly fight corruption. 

We could state for example that from this moment on, things will be different. From this moment on, we restart the camerta with a clean set of obligations and income. The new decree on annates indicates that half of papal income goes to the college of cardinals so the cardinals get a different income stream as well. We cannot be seen to come for their heads, but we should rather say: we are making a fresh start. From now on, no more new pluralism and all existing arrangements to and from the camera end. Half of the papal income goes directly to funding the papal residence, security, scribes and other expenses, and the other half goes to the cardinals to improve the service of their areas. If we open corruption investigations against all cardinals, they will have no choice but to fight us to the death.

Weighed pragmatic reform strategy against NPC agenda and imminent interruption






The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius's expression shifts. The tension in his shoulders eases slightly—but his eyes remain sharp, thinking.

"A fresh start. No investigations into past sins. Simply... end the old arrangements and begin anew." He repeats the idea slowly, testing it. "This is... merciful. Perhaps wiser than We had considered."

He rises, paces to the window, speaks with his back turned.

"You are right that pursuing every corrupt cardinal would unite them against Us. They would have nothing to lose. Cornered animals fight hardest." A pause. "But if We say instead: the past is past, we begin fresh, the new system provides for you honestly—then they have something to protect. Their future income. Their position. Their dignity."

He turns back, but his expression is troubled.

"There is wisdom in this. But—"

His jaw tightens.

"The crusade treasury. Your treasury, Juan. Three hundred and fifteen thousand florins you entrusted to the Church for sacred purpose. If We make a clean break, if We investigate nothing..." He spreads his hands. "We never learn where it went. We never recover what was taken. The men who stole from God—if men did steal—face no consequences. They simply... keep what they took."

He moves closer.

"Can you accept this? You rode through storms, lost seventy-five men to the Mistral, brought your pregnant wife across the sea—all to fulfill a crusade vow. And the treasury meant to fund that sacred work may have been plundered by men who will never answer for it."

His voice drops.

"We are prepared to let Our own negligence go unexamined, if that is the price of reform. But this is not Our money. It is yours. Castile's. Given in faith for Constantinople."

He holds Juan's gaze.

"If We make this fresh start you describe—are you prepared to let that treasury go? To never know how much remains or who took what was missing? Because if We open that single question, We open everything. And if We do not..."

He leaves the sentence unfinished.

A knock at the door. Soft. Hesitant.

Eugenius glances toward it, then back at Juan.

"Parentucelli," he says quietly. "He has arrived. What do We tell him about the treasury? About all of this? Do We proceed with your fresh start—or do We demand an accounting of what was taken from Castile?"

Lets ask him as well. And if you were wondering if I can live with the treasury going to some palace of a cardinal? If me forgiving him means a better, reformed and united church no price is too high. Jezus learns us to turn the other cheek. What's done is done, now lets turn ourselves to the future. 

Parentucelli, come in.

Architected cautious NPC with hidden agenda and guarded motivations







The Vatican Private Audience Chamber

Eugenius nods slowly at Juan's words. Something in his face eases—relief, perhaps, at being shown a path that does not require vengeance.

"Come," he calls toward the door.

It opens slowly. The man who enters is perhaps forty, slight of build, with the pale complexion of one who spends his days among books and manuscripts. His dark hair is thinning at the temples. His robes are plain—no silk, no embroidery, the simple black of a working cleric. But his eyes are sharp, quick, taking in the room in a single glance.

The Pope. The King of Castile. No secretaries. No cardinals. No guards within.

Tommaso Parentucelli drops to his knees immediately.

"Holy Father." His voice is steady, but there is a tremor beneath it—carefully controlled fear. "Your Holiness summoned me."

He does not look up. He does not look at Juan. Protocol demands he acknowledge only the Pope until given leave to do otherwise.

Eugenius glances at Juan, then back to the kneeling man.

"Rise, Tommaso. Close the door behind you."

Parentucelli obeys. When he turns back, his face is carefully neutral—but his hands, clasped before him, grip each other tightly. He has noticed the absence of scribes. The absence of witnesses. The presence of a foreign king in what should be a private papal chamber.

He knows something extraordinary is happening. He does not know if it is opportunity or danger.

His eyes flick briefly to Juan—assessing, curious, wary—then back to the Pope.

"How may I serve Your Holiness?"

What a chapter. From the salt-spray of Ostia harbor to the private chambers of the Vatican, Juan has navigated storms both literal and political. The fleet now has protocols to survive the next Mistral. And the Pope of Rome—broken, vulnerable, rediscovering his faith—has committed to bringing down the hammer on the very corruption that has been devouring the Church from within.

Parentucelli waits on his knees, sharp eyes taking in everything. The next chapter begins with a question: can this scholar be trusted with the most dangerous secret in Christendom?
