Let me search for more context about the current timeline and what happened.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nNow I have a clear picture. The romantic dinner was on November 10, 1433, and we're now continuing to November 11, 1433 - the morning after Juan proposed to Lucia d'Este in the moonlit garden.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.13\n\n\nNovember 11, 1433 — The Morning After\n\n\nThe Alcázar of Toledo awakens slowly, winter light filtering pale through the eastern windows of your private chambers. You slept deeply—more deeply than you have in months—and wake with a clarity that surprises you.\n\n\nThe sapphire ring.\n\n\nThe moonlit garden.\n\n\n\"Yes. Yes, I will be your wife.\"\n\n\nIt happened. It truly happened.\n\n\nYou rise and dress with the assistance of your body servants, choosing simple clothing—a dark woolen doublet, practical rather than ceremonial. There is much to be done today, but your mind keeps returning to those grey-green eyes, that sharp tongue, the way she placed the ring on her own finger rather than waiting for you to do it.\n\n\n\"I will NOT be a quiet wife.\"\n\n\nNo. You suspect she will not be.\n\n\nAs you break your fast in your private solar—bread, cheese, olives, weak wine—a knock comes at the door. Don Álvaro enters, looking as though he has been awake for hours already. Papers are tucked under his arm.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty slept well, I trust?\" A hint of knowing in his voice. The entire Alcázar will have noticed you did not return from Lucia's apartments until well after midnight. Nothing improper occurred—the chaperones saw to that, and you would not dishonor your betrothed before the wedding—but tongues will wag regardless.\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down his papers and meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"Congratulations are in order, I understand. The lady accepted?\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then adds: \"The formal betrothal announcement must be made soon, Your Majesty. The Italian delegation, the court, the foreign ambassadors—they will all expect ceremony. But the lady's unusual request for a private meeting first means we have... flexibility. The question is timing.\"\n\n\nHe glances at his papers. \"Several matters require your attention today. But perhaps the most pressing is: when do you wish to see the Lady Lucia again? She is awake—her maid sent word she rose with the dawn and is taking breakfast in her apartments. Apparently she asked whether you are an early riser, or whether kings sleep until noon.\"\n\n\nA hint of amusement crosses Álvaro's weathered face. \"She also asked whether Castilian breakfasts are always so 'aggressively plain,' or whether this was a test of Italian resolve.\"\n\n\nThe autumn sun climbs higher over Toledo. Your betrothed is awake, your constable awaits your orders, and somewhere in this fortress your children are stirring.\n\n\nWhat would you like to do, Your Majesty?"

      "say": "Álvaro's eyebrows rise slightly at your theatrical sigh, but a smile tugs at the corner of his mouth.\n\n\n\"As soon as possible?\" He strokes his chin, calculating. \"The Church requires the reading of banns on three successive Sundays before a valid marriage—that is canon law, and not even a king may dispense with it without papal intervention. Today is Friday, the eleventh of November. If we announce the betrothal publicly this Sunday and begin the banns immediately...\"\n\n\nHe counts on his fingers.\n\n\n\"First reading: Sunday, November 13th. Second: November 20th. Third: November 27th. The earliest canonically valid wedding date would be Monday, November 28th.\" He pauses. \"Though a wedding on a Monday is unusual. Most would expect Saturday, December 3rd, or Sunday, December 4th.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down his papers and folds his arms.\n\n\n\"However, Your Majesty, there are... considerations beyond canon law.\"\n\n\nHe ticks them off:\n\n\n\"First: The Lady Lucia arrived only yesterday. A betrothal announcement tomorrow would set tongues wagging across Europe. Some will say the King of Castile is unseemly eager. Others will whisper that something improper occurred to necessitate such haste.\" He raises a hand before you can object. \"I know nothing did. But gossip does not require truth, only opportunity.\"\n\n\n\"Second: The Italian delegation expects certain courtesies. A formal betrothal ceremony, exchange of gifts, time for the lady's household to prepare. Her uncle the Marquess sent six ladies-in-waiting and two confessors—they will want to feel their presence matters, not that they were rushed through like merchants at a toll gate.\"\n\n\n\"Third: Christmas is six weeks away. A wedding in early December would overshadow the season—or be overshadowed by it. Some would counsel waiting until after Epiphany, mid-January, when the court is refreshed and the roads more passable for those who wish to attend.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"My counsel? Announce the formal betrothal this Sunday, with appropriate ceremony. Let the banns be read. Wed in early December—perhaps Saturday the 3rd—before Christmas makes travel difficult. That gives three weeks for preparation, which is swift but not scandalous.\"\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\"Unless, of course, you have reasons for greater haste that I should know about?\"\n\n\nHis tone is carefully neutral, but his eyes are sharp. Álvaro has served you long enough to know when you are planning something."

The betrothal ceremony this Sunday will require some arrangement—I suggest the Cathedral, followed by a formal reception here at the Alcázar. Nothing so grand as Fernando's baptism, but dignified.\"\n\n\nHe makes a note on one of his papers, then shuffles through the rest.\n\n\n\"Other matters, Your Majesty. None urgent enough to spoil your breakfast, but several requiring your attention today or in coming days.\"\n\n\nHe consults his notes:\n\n\n\"First: Doña Beatriz sent word that Princess Catalina has been asking for you since she woke. Apparently she wishes to show you something she built with her wooden blocks. The lady Lucia has also been mentioned—Catalina keeps asking about 'the pretty lady' and whether she will visit again.\"\n\n\nA slight pause. \"The children will need to be told about the betrothal before the public announcement. How you wish to handle that is... delicate.\"\n\n\n\"Second: A courier arrived late last night from Commander Martín's Morocco expedition. The message is brief—they made landfall safely at Tétouan and have begun establishing contacts. No detailed intelligence yet, merely confirmation they arrived. The full report remains expected in the coming weeks.\"\n\n\n\"Third: Don Íñigo López de Mendoza requests an audience at your convenience. The Council of Great Houses has completed its first round of internal audits, and he wishes to present the findings personally. He seemed pleased, which suggests the news is good.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth:\" Álvaro hesitates slightly. \"A letter arrived from Basel. From Fray Hernando. I have not opened it—it is marked for your eyes alone.\"\n\n\nHe sets a sealed letter on the table. The wax bears Fray Hernando's simple Franciscan seal.\n\n\n\"That is everything pressing. Shall I arrange for Don Íñigo this afternoon? And what would you have me tell Doña Beatriz regarding the children?\""

And tell Doña Beatriz I will see the children shortly—but first, I have a lady to attend upon.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's expression flickers with something between amusement and resignation. \"As Your Majesty wishes.\"\n\n\n\nThe corridors of the Alcázar are quiet at this hour, servants moving softly about their morning duties. You pass through the gallery where autumn light falls in long golden rectangles across the stone floor, then climb the stairs to the guest apartments in the eastern wing—the finest rooms the fortress offers, traditionally reserved for visiting royalty.\n\n\nTwo of Lucia's Italian guards stand at the door, liveried in Ferrara's colors. They stiffen at your approach, clearly uncertain of protocol. Does one bar a king from a lady's chambers? Does one simply step aside?\n\n\nYou spare them the dilemma by stopping at a respectful distance and inclining your head.\n\n\n\"Please inform the Lady Lucia that the King of Castile requests the honor of her company, if she is receiving visitors.\"\n\n\nOne guard disappears inside. You hear a brief murmur of feminine voices—Italian, too quick to follow—and then laughter. Lucia's laughter, you think. Sharp and bright.\n\n\nThe door opens wider.\n\n\nLucia stands in the entrance herself, rather than sending a servant. She wears a morning gown of deep green wool, simple but beautifully cut, her dark hair loosely braided rather than elaborately styled. The sapphire ring glints on her finger—she has not removed it.\n\n\nThose grey-green eyes sweep over you, taking in your plain doublet, your lack of ceremony, the fact that you came alone without a retinue of attendants.\n\n\n\"The King of Castile,\" she says, her Italian accent curling around the Castilian words. \"Knocking at doors like a common suitor. Do they not teach kings to send servants with flowery messages and wait to be summoned?\"\n\n\nA smile plays at the corner of her mouth.\n\n\n\"I was just telling my ladies that Castilian breakfasts appear to consist entirely of bread, olives, and stubbornness. They did not believe me.\" She steps back, gesturing you inside. \"Come. Tell them I am not exaggerating. And explain to me why there is no frittata, no sweet pastries, no proper coffee—\"\n\n\nShe stops.\n\n\n\"You do have coffee in Castile, yes?\""

The room smells of bread and honey—apparently someone found something sweet for the Ferrarese contingent—and a fire crackles in the hearth against the November chill.\n\n\nLucia closes the door behind you, leaving her guards in the corridor.\n\n\n\"Coffee,\" she repeats, seizing on the word. \"You say it as though you know what it is. This gives me hope.\" She moves to stand beside you, close enough that you catch the faint scent of rosewater. \"In Ferrara, we have it from the Venetian traders. Bitter, black, hot—it wakes the mind like nothing else. My uncle claims it is a Muslim invention and therefore suspect, but he drinks three cups every morning nonetheless.\"\n\n\nOne of her ladies—an older woman with silver threading her dark hair, who carries herself with the quiet authority of a senior attendant—speaks up in accented Castilian.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am Donna Francesca de' Roberti. I served the Lady Lucia's mother, God rest her soul, and now attend the Lady herself.\" She gestures to the table. \"We have been... adapting to Castilian hospitality. The bread is excellent. The olives are...\" She searches for a diplomatic word.\n\n\n\"Abundant,\" another lady supplies, and several of them suppress smiles.\n\n\nLucia waves a hand. \"Ignore them. They are testing whether the King of Castile has a sense of humor or whether they must spend the rest of their lives being solemn and dull.\"\n\n\nShe looks at you directly, and her tone shifts—still light, but with something more genuine beneath it.\n\n\n\"You came yourself. This morning. Without sending a herald or a formal invitation or a procession of servants.\" The sapphire catches the firelight as she gestures. \"I was not certain you would. Kings are busy. There are... matters of state, I am told.\"\n\n\nShe waits, watching your face."

Not to replace Castilian traditions, but to... complement them.

She says little, but you feel her attention like a living thing, cataloging, assessing.\n\n\n\"Your fortress is older than I expected,\" she says as you pass through the gallery. \"Ferrara is all new construction—my uncle tears down anything more than fifty years old and rebuilds it with more columns. This has... weight. History.\"\n\n\nShe pauses at a window overlooking the Tagus, the river silver-grey under the November sky.\n\n\n\"Isabel walked these halls,\" she says quietly. It is not a question.\n\n\nBefore you can respond, you reach the royal family's apartments. Doña Beatriz meets you at the door, and her eyes widen slightly at the sight of Lucia on your arm—but she is too well-trained to show more than a flicker of surprise.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty. The princess has been waiting most eagerly.\"\n\n\nShe opens the door.\n\n\nThe nursery is warm, a fire burning low, morning light streaming through the windows. And there in the center of the room sits Catalina—nineteen months old, dark-haired like her mother, serious-faced with concentration—surrounded by an ambitious construction of wooden blocks that appears to be either a castle or a very confused cathedral.\n\n\nShe looks up at the sound of the door.\n\n\n\"Papá!\"\n\n\nHer face splits into a radiant smile. Then her eyes move to the woman beside you, and she goes very still, studying Lucia with that peculiar intensity that small children possess.\n\n\n\"Pretty lady,\" she announces, as though confirming a scientific hypothesis. Then, with the absolute confidence of a princess who knows her own mind: \"Come see.

She points to a lopsided tower of blocks. \"That's where Papá sleeps.\" Her finger moves to a slightly shorter stack. \"That's where I sleep.\" A pause, and she frowns at a gap in the structure. \"Fernando sleeps... somewhere. He's little.\"\n\n\nShe looks at Lucia with sudden intensity.\n\n\n\"Where do you sleep?\"\n\n\nLucia glances at you—a flash of those grey-green eyes, amused and slightly panicked—then turns back to Catalina with appropriate gravity.\n\n\n\"I sleep in a room with many ladies who talk too much,\" she says. \"It is very noisy.

When you glance at her, she is watching the three of you with an expression you cannot quite read. Something tender and guarded all at once, as though she is witnessing something precious and fragile that she is not yet certain she is allowed to touch."

However, I notice we're now in November 1433 and the expected report timing was October/November 1433. The roll was made but the actual content of the report wasn't detailed. Let me search for more information about what was already established.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nI found it. The roll was already made: 71/100 - Moderate Success. The outcome was pre-determined in Book 1:\n\n\nOutcome (to be revealed October/November 1433):\n\n\nPresence established in 2 of 3 target cities (Tangier, Tétouan)\n\nLocal reception cautiously receptive\n\nCommander Martín's reputation preceded him (honorable enemy)\n\nFreed prisoners' testimony created initial goodwill\n\nBasic intelligence network functioning\n\nSmall trade developing\n\n20-22 delegates operating safely\n\nSalé remains too hostile\n\nFoundation laid but expansion requires patience\n\n\nSo the roll has already been made. What we need now is to narrate the detailed content of Commander Martín's report based on this outcome. Let me craft the letter.\n\n\n\nI find that the roll was already made in Chapter 44 (Book 1): 71/100 - Moderate Success. The outcome was established as:\n\n\nPresence established in 2 of 3 target cities (Tangier, Tétouan)\n\nLocal reception cautiously receptive\n\nCommander Martín's reputation preceded him\n\nFreed prisoners' testimony created initial goodwill\n\nBasic intelligence network functioning\n\nSmall trade developing\n\n20-22 delegates operating safely\n\nSalé remains too hostile\n\nFoundation laid but expansion requires patience\n\n\nSo we don't need a new roll—we need to narrate Commander Martín's actual report based on this established outcome.\n\n\n\nÁlvaro hands you the sealed packet. You break the wax—Commander Martín's seal, a simple cross over a crescent moon, the symbol he chose after his baptism.\n\n\nThe letter is substantial: several pages in Martín's careful hand, written in Castilian but with occasional Arabic terms where no translation suffices.\n\n\n\nTo His Most Christian Majesty Juan II of Castile, from your servant Martín de Alcalá, written at Tétouan on the twenty-third day of October in the year of Our Lord 1433.\n\n\nYour Majesty,\n\n\nBy the grace of God, I write to report on our mission's progress. All twenty-three members of the delegation remain alive and in good health. We have established ourselves in two cities—Tangier and Tétouan—though Salé proved impossible for reasons I shall explain.\n\n\nOn Tangier:\n\n\nWe arrived in late May and presented ourselves as merchants seeking trade in leather, wool, and dyes. The governor, one Ibn Battuta al-Fasi (no relation to the famous traveler), received us with caution but not hostility. Word of the freed prisoners had preceded us—several had returned to their families in the region and spoke of Your Majesty's honorable treatment. This opened doors that gold alone could not.\n\n\nThe city is fragmented. The Marinid Sultan's authority extends in name only; the governor operates as an independent lord, paying nominal tribute while conducting his own affairs. There are perhaps three factions competing for influence: the governor's household, a coalition of wealthy merchants, and a group of religious scholars who view the governor as insufficiently pious.\n\n\nFernando has proven invaluable. His reputation as a learned man who genuinely sought truth—rather than a coward who converted for advantage—has earned him invitations to scholarly discussions. He reports that many educated Moors are troubled by the same questions that moved him: why did God permit Granada to fall? What does it mean for Islam's future in the West?\n\n\nWe have established a small trading house, purchasing leather at favorable rates. This provides cover for our presence and generates modest income—perhaps sixty florins over the summer months. More importantly, it gives us reason to speak with merchants, officials, and travelers.\n\n\nOn Tétouan:\n\n\nTétouan is smaller but more promising. The town was destroyed by Castilian forces forty years ago and rebuilt by refugees from al-Andalus—many of them from families who fled earlier Christian conquests. They speak Castilian among themselves, though they pretend otherwise. Several of our delegation have family connections here; this has proven our greatest asset.\n\n\nThe local qadi, one Ahmad ibn Yusuf, has shown cautious interest in establishing formal trade relations with Castile. He is pragmatic: Tétouan survives on commerce, and access to Castilian timber and iron would benefit his people. He has not yet agreed to anything binding, but he has not expelled us either. I judge him a man who waits to see which way the wind blows.\n\n\nFernando has been invited to teach at a small madrasa—Islamic and Christian scholars debating philosophy, as was done in Toledo two centuries ago. He treads carefully, but the conversations are genuine.\n\n\nOn Salé:\n\n\nSalé is controlled by corsairs who prey on Christian shipping. They would not receive us. Three of our men who approached the city were turned away at the gates with warnings that \"apostates\" would be killed on sight if they returned. We have abandoned efforts there for now. Perhaps in time, if our presence in Tangier and Tétouan becomes established, attitudes may soften.\n\n\nOn the Marinid Sultan:\n\n\nThe Sultan in Fez is weak—a boy of fourteen manipulated by competing regents. The realm is fragmenting. Governors act independently; tribal leaders ignore royal edicts; the treasury is empty. There is no unified Morocco to negotiate with, only a patchwork of local powers.\n\n\nThis is both opportunity and danger. Opportunity because local rulers may be approached individually. Danger because no agreement with one guarantees safety from another.\n\n\nAssessment:\n\n\nYour Majesty asked for honest counsel. Here it is:\n\n\nMorocco cannot be conquered as Granada was conquered. The distances are too great, the terrain too harsh, the population too dispersed. But it need not be conquered. The Marinid state is dying. In ten years, perhaps twenty, it will collapse entirely into warring fragments.\n\n\nWhat Castile can do—what we are beginning to do—is position ourselves to influence what comes after. Build relationships now with men who will matter later. Establish trade that makes Castilian friendship valuable. Plant seeds.\n\n\nThe prisoners Your Majesty freed speak of you with wonder. \"A Christian king who kept his word.\" This is rare currency in Morocco. Spend it wisely and it will multiply.\n\n\nWe require nothing urgent. Funds are adequate through the winter. If Your Majesty could send additional trade goods—good Castilian steel, worked leather, perhaps some of the Granada silk—it would strengthen our position. A letter of formal introduction for Fernando to present to scholarly circles would also help; something indicating royal favor for interfaith dialogue.\n\n\nI remain Your Majesty's faithful servant until death,\n\n\nMartín de Alcalá\n\n\nWritten in my own hand, witnessed by Fernando, formerly Ahmad al-Zarqali\n\n\n\nYou set down the letter. Álvaro has been watching your face as you read.\n\n\n\"Good news, Your Majesty? Or merely the absence of bad news?\"\n\n\nLucia, you notice, has closed her book entirely. She makes no pretense of not listening."

Juan accepted enthusiastically. The Council began operating with House Mendoza leading, conducting audits on three member families and collecting 15,000 maravedís in underpayments.\n\n\nTime Period: One year of operation\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors (Push ranges upward):\n\n\nHouse Mendoza's prestige — One of Castile's greatest families leading by example\n\nVoluntary nature — Joining is a choice, not a royal command; appeals to noble pride\n\nRoyal endorsement without royal control — Juan supports but doesn't dominate\n\nEarly concrete results — 15,000 maravedís collected demonstrates the system works\n\n\"Standard-setters\" framing — Appeals to noble self-image as kingdom's moral leaders\n\nJuan's Granada victory — Rising tide of royal prestige makes association attractive\n\nPeer pressure mechanism — Easier to comply than explain why you won't join\n\n\nFailure Factors (Push ranges downward):\n\n\nNoble suspicion of institutions — Anything formalized can be turned against them later\n\nMendoza rivals — Houses that resent Mendoza prominence may refuse to join \"their\" project\n\nAudit resentment — Even voluntary audits feel intrusive; some families have much to hide\n\nCompeting family interests — Great houses have feuds, grievances, conflicting ambitions\n\nFear of precedent — What starts voluntary may become mandatory under future kings\n\nSome houses genuinely corrupt — They cannot join without exposing themselves\n\n\n\nD100 Table: Council Development\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nStagnation/Quiet Failure. After initial enthusiasm, no new houses have joined. The three audited families resent the process; one has quietly withdrawn. Other great houses view it as \"Mendoza's vanity project.\" The Council exists in name only, meeting rarely. Don Íñigo is embarrassed but won't admit failure.\n11-25\nMinimal Growth. One additional house has joined (a minor great family seeking Mendoza favor). Audits continue but findings are modest. Other houses remain skeptical, watching but not committing. The concept hasn't failed, but hasn't caught fire either. Requires patience and perhaps a catalyzing event.\n26-40\nSlow but Steady. Two additional houses have joined. The Enríquez family (related to Don Fadrique) signed on after seeing the model work. Audits proceed; total collections around 25,000 maravedís over the year. Some houses remain hostile, but the institution is establishing legitimacy. Gradual progress.\n41-60\nSolid Foundation. Three to four additional houses have joined, bringing membership to six or seven great families. Collections total approximately 35,000-40,000 maravedís. The Council meets quarterly and has begun informal consultation on crown matters. Some rivalry about leadership, but the institution is healthy. A genuine success, if not spectacular.\n61-75\nGrowing Influence. Five additional houses have joined. The Council has become a recognized body; nobles speak of \"Council families\" with a mix of respect and envy. Collections exceed 50,000 maravedís. Two houses that initially refused are now quietly inquiring about membership. Don Íñigo's concept is vindicated.\n76-90\nRemarkable Success. Six to seven additional houses have joined, representing most of Castile's great families. Collections approach 70,000 maravedís. The Council has begun mediating minor disputes between member houses, reducing crown judicial burden. Non-member houses feel pressure to join or explain their absence. A genuine institutional innovation.\n91-100\nTransformative Institution. Eight or more houses have joined; the Council has become the de facto voice of Castile's high nobility. Collections exceed 80,000 maravedís. The Council has proposed its own initiatives (standardized inheritance practices, coordinated charity). Even rival houses have joined rather than be excluded from this influential body. Don Íñigo is celebrated as a visionary. The crown-nobility relationship has fundamentally shifted toward partnership.\n\n\nReady for the roll when you are, Your Majesty."

Juan's unprecedented personal engagement with noble families, particularly the gesture of trust with the Velascos, fundamentally shifted noble perception of the crown. The Velasco reconciliation alone signals to other great houses that opposition to Juan may be outdated.\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors (Push ranges upward):\n\n\nStrong Factors:\n\n\nHouse Mendoza's prestige — One of Castile's greatest families leading by example\n\nVoluntary nature — Appeals to noble pride; joining is an honor, not an obligation\n\nRoyal endorsement without royal control — Juan supports but doesn't dominate\n\nEarly concrete results — 15,000 maravedís collected demonstrates the system works\n\n\"Standard-setters\" framing — Appeals to noble self-image as kingdom's moral leaders\n\n\nVery Strong Factors (Post-Baptism):\n\n\nJuan's transformed reputation — The king who carried his daughter among the nobles, who sat with families, who trusted the Velascos with his child\n\nVelasco reconciliation — If the Velascos are reconsidering their stance toward Juan, other skeptical houses take notice\n\nGranada victory prestige — Association with Juan now carries reflected glory\n\nMomentum of goodwill — Nobles witnessed something genuine at the baptism; this creates openness to other genuine initiatives\n\nPeer pressure intensified — Houses that refuse to join now must explain why they stand apart when even old adversaries are warming to the king\n\n\nFailure Factors (Push ranges downward):\n\n\nModerate Factors:\n\n\nInstitutional suspicion — Some nobles instinctively distrust any formalized body\n\nMendoza rivals — Houses with grudges against Mendoza may resist \"their\" project\n\nHidden corruption — Some families cannot submit to audits without exposure\n\nFear of precedent — Voluntary today, mandatory tomorrow?\n\n\nWeakened Factors (Post-Baptism):\n\n\nGeneral noble opposition to crown — Significantly reduced after baptism\n\nPerception of Juan as threat — Largely replaced by perception of Juan as partner\n\nCynicism about royal motives — Harder to maintain after witnessing Juan's genuine warmth\n\n\n\nRevised Assessment:\n\n\nThe baptism fundamentally changed the political soil in which the Council is growing. Before October 1433, the Council was a promising experiment in uncertain terrain. After the baptism, it operates in an environment where:\n\n\nNoble skepticism of Juan has softened dramatically\n\nThe \"partnership\" model has been demonstrated, not just proclaimed\n\nHouses that were waiting to see which way the wind blows now see it blowing toward cooperation\n\nThe Velasco shift creates cover for other hesitant houses to join\n\n\nNet evaluation: Success factors substantially outweigh failure factors. The floor rises significantly; true failure is now unlikely absent specific disasters.\n\n\n\nD100 Table: Council Development (Revised)\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nUnexpected Setback. Despite favorable conditions, a scandal emerges—perhaps an audit reveals something embarrassing about a founding member, or a bitter feud between two member houses spills into public view. The Council survives but is damaged. Four houses total, collections around 20,000 maravedís. Don Íñigo must manage a crisis before growth can resume.\n6-15\nModest Progress. The Council grows slowly—two new houses join, bringing total membership to five. Collections around 30,000 maravedís. The institution is stable but hasn't captured the post-baptism momentum as fully as hoped. Some houses remain cautious, wanting to see more track record before committing. Solid foundation, but patience required.\n16-35\nSolid Growth. Three to four new houses join, including at least one that was previously skeptical. Total membership of six to seven great families. Collections of 40,000-50,000 maravedís. The Council meets regularly and has begun informal consultations on matters affecting the nobility. Respectable success; the model is proving itself.\n36-60\nStrong Development. Five new houses join, bringing membership to eight families. The Enríquez and at least one other prominent house have signed on. Collections exceed 55,000 maravedís. The Council is becoming a recognized institution; \"Council families\" is becoming a term of distinction. Several non-member houses are quietly inquiring about joining. Don Íñigo's vision is being realized.\n61-80\nRemarkable Success. Six to seven new houses join. The Velascos—following their reconciliation with Juan—have either joined or signaled serious interest, which would be a major symbolic victory. Total membership approaches ten great families. Collections reach 70,000-80,000 maravedís. The Council has begun mediating minor disputes between members. Non-member great houses feel genuine pressure to join or be seen as outsiders.\n81-95\nExceeds Expectations. Eight or more new houses join, including former skeptics. The Council represents the clear majority of Castile's great nobility. Collections exceed 90,000 maravedís. The institution has begun proposing its own initiatives—standardized practices, coordinated responses to crown consultations. Membership is now a mark of prestige; remaining outside requires explanation. The crown-nobility relationship has shifted toward genuine partnership.\n96-100\nTransformative Institution. The Council becomes the voice of Castile's high nobility. Virtually all great houses are members or actively seeking membership. Collections exceed 100,000 maravedís. The Council mediates disputes, coordinates charitable efforts, and serves as a formal consultative body to the crown. Don Íñigo is celebrated as the architect of a new era. Foreign courts take notice of this innovation in noble-crown relations. Juan's vision of partnership has been institutionalized.\n\n\nReady for the roll, Your Majesty."

Nothing so grand as a banquet—bread, roasted fowl, cheese, olives, and wine sufficient for conversation without ceremony.\n\n\nCatalina has been returned to Doña Beatriz's care, though not without protest. (\"But I want to see the lord,\" she insisted, until distracted by promises of an afternoon visit to the stables.)\n\n\nLucia remains. You did not ask her to leave, and she did not offer to go. She has taken a seat slightly apart from the head of the table, positioned to observe without intruding—the posture of someone who understands the value of listening.\n\n\nÁlvaro escorts Don Íñigo López de Mendoza into the chamber.\n\n\nThe head of House Mendoza is a man in his middle fifties, his dark hair silvered at the temples, his bearing that of a scholar as much as a lord. He is known throughout Castile not only for his family's wealth and influence but for his poetry and his library—one of the finest in the kingdom. His eyes are sharp, missing nothing as they take in the informal setting, the presence of Álvaro, and—with a flicker of interest—the Italian woman seated near the window.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He bows with practiced grace. \"I thank you for receiving me. And I see congratulations are in order.\" A slight smile. \"Word travels quickly in Toledo. The lady Lucia d'Este, I presume?\"\n\n\nHe turns to Lucia and bows again, lower this time—the courtesy due to a future queen.\n\n\n\"My lady. House Mendoza welcomes you to Castile. I hope you will find our kingdom worthy of your gifts.\"\n\n\nLucia inclines her head, a smile playing at her lips. \"Don Íñigo. Your reputation precedes you. I am told you are both a lord and a poet—a combination I thought existed only in old romances.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo's eyes warm with appreciation for the wit. \"The romance is somewhat less glamorous in practice, my lady. Mostly it involves arguing with stewards about grain prices and then writing melancholy verses about the futility of arguing with stewards.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to you, his expression shifting to business.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I come bearing news of the Council of Great Houses. We have completed our first year of operation, and I believe the results merit your attention.\""

He takes a moment to gather his thoughts—the manner of a man who values precision in speech.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I will be direct. The Council has grown, though not as swiftly as I had hoped.\"\n\n\nHe sets down his cup.\n\n\n\"When we began last November, House Mendoza stood alone—proposing a concept that many found... unusual. Great families policing themselves? Voluntary audits? Consultation without demanding concessions?\" A wry smile. \"My peers suspected a trap. They could not understand why any lord would submit himself to scrutiny unless compelled.\"\n\n\nHe ticks off points on his fingers.\n\n\n\"In the first months, we had only the three founding houses—Mendoza, and two families closely allied with us by marriage. The audits we conducted were largely symbolic. We collected fifteen thousand maravedís in underpayments, yes, but from families already inclined to comply. The skeptics watched and waited.\"\n\n\nHe pauses for wine.\n\n\n\"The turn came in spring, after Your Majesty's return from Rome and Basel. The conquest of Granada, the honors from the Pope, the Military Orders' submission—these changed the calculation. Suddenly, association with the crown carried weight rather than risk. Three more houses approached us between April and August.\"\n\n\nHe names them: \"House Enríquez—Don Fadrique's kin, which lent military credibility. House Guzmán—a surprise, given their traditional independence, but they saw which way the wind was blowing. And House Manrique, who I suspect joined primarily to ensure they were not excluded from whatever this becomes.\"\n\n\n\"That brings us to six families. A seventh—House Pimentel—has made inquiries but not yet committed. They wish to see how the next round of audits proceeds.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo's expression becomes more thoughtful.\n\n\n\"Collections for the full year stand at approximately forty-three thousand maravedís. Not a fortune, but meaningful—and more importantly, collected voluntarily, without royal enforcement or resentment. The audits have uncovered modest underpayments, errors in accounting, a few cases of deliberate evasion quietly corrected. No scandals. No public humiliations. The system works as intended.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward slightly.\n\n\n\"We have also begun something I did not anticipate. Consultation. When House Guzmán faced a dispute with a lesser family over grazing rights, they brought it to the Council rather than pursuing it through royal courts or private warfare. We mediated. The matter was resolved in three days rather than three years.\"\n\n\nA slight smile crosses his weathered face.\n\n\n\"This, I think, may prove more valuable than the tax collections. Great families speaking to one another as peers, resolving grievances before they fester. It is... novel.\"\n\n\nHe sits back.\n\n\n\"But I will not paint too bright a picture. Several great houses remain outside—some skeptical, some hostile, some simply indifferent. House Velasco has not joined, though...\" He pauses, choosing words carefully. \"...I am told Don Pedro returned from the prince's baptism with a changed perspective. Whether that extends to the Council, I cannot yet say.\"\n\n\n\"House Stúñiga remains aloof. House Osorio views us with suspicion. And there are whispers—mostly from those outside—that the Council is merely 'Mendoza's instrument' dressed in cooperative clothing.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes directly.\n\n\n\"The foundation is solid, Your Majesty. The institution is proving itself. But it has not yet achieved the momentum that would make membership expected rather than optional. We are at a delicate stage—past the point of failure, not yet at the point of inevitability.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"That is the honest accounting. What questions does Your Majesty have?\""

      "say": "Don Íñigo considers the question carefully, swirling the wine in his cup.\n\n\n\"There are several paths, Your Majesty. Some require your direct involvement. Others are better left to the Council itself, lest we become what our critics claim—an instrument of the crown rather than a genuine noble institution.\"\n\n\nHe sets down the cup and begins to outline his thoughts.\n\n\n\"First: The Velasco Question.\"\n\n\n\"Don Pedro's shift in sentiment after the baptism is an opportunity we must not squander. If House Velasco joins, it transforms the Council overnight. They are ancient, respected, and—critically—they have been skeptical of Your Majesty's reign. Their membership would signal that this is not a gathering of royal favorites, but a genuine institution of Castile's great nobility.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"But the approach matters. If Your Majesty invites them directly, it becomes a royal request—and Don Pedro may feel compelled rather than choosing freely. If I approach them, it smells of Mendoza expansion. The ideal would be for House Enríquez or House Guzmán to extend the invitation. Peers inviting peers. Don Pedro can accept without feeling he bends to anyone.\"\n\n\n\"Second: A Visible Royal Consultation.\"\n\n\n\"Your Majesty has endorsed the Council, but the realm has not seen the crown treating us as a legitimate consultative body. If you were to formally request the Council's advice on some matter of policy—not a trivial matter, but something of genuine substance—it would demonstrate that membership carries influence, not merely obligation.\"\n\n\nHe raises a cautionary finger. \"This must be carefully chosen. A matter where noble input is appropriate and welcome. Perhaps something touching on noble privileges in the newly conquered Granada territories? Or the terms of service for noble levies in future campaigns? Something where our counsel would be genuinely useful, and where Your Majesty can be seen to listen.\"\n\n\n\"Third: The Mediation Precedent.\"\n\n\n\"The Guzmán grazing dispute was resolved quietly. Too quietly, perhaps. If we were to handle a more visible dispute—something the realm knows about—and resolve it fairly and efficiently, it would demonstrate the Council's value beyond tax compliance. Great families would see membership as useful, not merely prestigious.\"\n\n\nHe frowns slightly. \"The difficulty is that we cannot manufacture disputes. We must wait for one to arise naturally. But when it does, we should be ready.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth: Charter and Formalization.\"\n\n\n\"At present, the Council operates by custom and mutual agreement. We have no written charter, no formal rules, no defined membership criteria. This informality has served us well in the early stage—it feels like a gathering of friends rather than an institution. But as we grow, we will need structure.\"\n\n\n\"A royal charter—granted at the Council's request, not imposed—would give us permanence. It would also make clear that membership is a privilege that can be withheld from those who do not meet standards. Houses that remain outside would no longer be 'choosing not to join' but 'failing to qualify.'\"\n\n\nHe glances at Álvaro, then back to you.\n\n\n\"This is perhaps a matter for next year, once membership has grown further. But Your Majesty should know it is in my thoughts.\"\n\n\n\"Fifth: The Danger to Avoid.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo's expression grows serious.\n\n\n\"The Council must never become—or appear to become—a mechanism for royal control of the nobility. The moment great families believe their membership serves your interests rather than theirs, the institution dies. Even if it continues in name, the spirit will be gone.\"\n\n\n\"This means Your Majesty must sometimes refrain from using the Council, even when it would be convenient. It means accepting that the Council may occasionally offer advice you do not wish to hear. It means treating us as partners, not instruments.\"\n\n\nA slight smile. \"I do not think this will be difficult for Your Majesty. You have demonstrated at every turn that you understand partnership. But I mention it because future kings may not share your instincts, and the institution must be built to survive them.\"\n\n\nHe sits back, his assessment complete.\n\n\n\"Those are my thoughts. I am certain the Lady Lucia and Don Álvaro have perspectives I have not considered.\"\n\n\nHe looks to Lucia with genuine interest—not mere courtesy, but the curiosity of a man who values intelligence regardless of its source."

The letter accomplishes several things at once—public recognition, genuine consultation, and a practical benefit to membership. I will draft it for your review this evening.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo's face has shifted during your words. The careful neutrality of a lord presenting a report has given way to something warmer—satisfaction, perhaps even a touch of emotion he is working to contain.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says slowly, \"the matter of the Crown Marshals is... significant. You understand what you are offering?\"\n\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\n\"At present, when a Marshal suspects a great house of irregularities, he approaches that house directly—as a royal agent, with the implicit threat of royal authority behind him. The lord must respond to the crown, which many find... grating. It reminds us that we hold our positions at royal pleasure, that we can be investigated like common tax farmers.\"\n\n\n\"But if the Marshal approaches the Council first, the dynamic transforms entirely. The Council investigates its own member. Peers examine peers. If wrongdoing is found, the house answers to its fellow lords—not to a royal official. The crown's interests are served, but noble dignity is preserved.\"\n\n\nHe sits back, shaking his head slightly.\n\n\n\"This will bring House Velasco in. I am nearly certain of it. Don Pedro's chief grievance has always been royal officials meddling in great families' affairs. You have just removed that grievance for Council members while keeping it in place for those who refuse to join.\"\n\n\nA slight smile crosses his face. \"You have made membership valuable in a way that costs you nothing but a change in procedure.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro glances up from his notes. \"It also gives the Council teeth without giving it a sword. They can investigate, recommend, mediate—but final authority remains with the crown if matters escalate beyond what peers can resolve.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo nods. \"Precisely. The balance is preserved.\"\n\n\nLucia has been listening intently. Now she speaks, her voice thoughtful.\n\n\n\"And the consultation on Granada titles—this is clever as well. You ask for advice on a matter that directly concerns noble interests. They will argue amongst themselves about the structure, which tells you what they want. You are not obligated to accept their recommendations, but you will know the shape of their ambitions.\"\n\n\nShe tilts her head. \"In Ferrara, my uncle calls this 'letting them write the map of their own desires.' Very useful for navigation.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo regards her with evident appreciation. \"The lady has a political mind.\"\n\n\n\"The lady grew up watching her uncle play Venice against Milan against Florence,\" Lucia replies dryly. \"One learns, or one becomes a pawn.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo turns back to you.\n\n\n\"Is there anything specific you wish me to convey to the Council before the letter arrives?

Last week I found her annotating Ovid. Annotating.

She needs no encouragement.\"\n\n\nYou speak of Catalina's wooden horse named Horse, of Fernando's growing strength, of the small moments that make up a father's days between matters of state.

He has served you long enough to know that these moments of warmth between king and lord accomplish more than a dozen formal audiences.\n\n\nWhen the meal concludes, Don Íñigo rises and bows.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.

Perhaps the chestnut mare would be more—\"\n\n\n\"Saddle Tormenta.\"\n\n\nThe groom looks to you, seeking confirmation or rescue. Lucia catches the glance and turns as well, meeting your eyes across the stable. There is challenge in her expression—not defiance, but a question. Will you override me? Will you protect me from my own choice?\n\n\nCatalina, oblivious to the tension, pats Hidalgo's neck and announces, \"The pretty lady picked the black one, Papá.\""

You guide him out of the stables and into the courtyard, where the afternoon sun casts long shadows across the cobblestones.\n\n\nCatalina gasps as the horse begins to move beneath her.\n\n\n\"Papá! We're—we're moving!\"\n\n\nHer small hands grip the pommel tighter, her body rigid with the effort of adjusting to this new sensation—the rolling rhythm of Hidalgo's walk, the slight sway with each step. You keep the pace slow, letting her find her balance.\n\n\nAround the courtyard you go. Once. Twice. Guards at their posts watch with carefully neutral expressions, though more than one smile escapes. Servants pause in their work to observe their king riding circles in the courtyard with a toddler clutched before him.\n\n\nBy the third circuit, Catalina's death grip on the pommel has loosened. She sits straighter, her body beginning to move with Hidalgo rather than against him.\n\n\n\"I'm riding,\" she announces to no one in particular. Then, louder, to a guardsman near the gate: \"I'm riding! On Hidalgo!\"\n\n\nThe guard bows, his face carefully solemn. \"Indeed you are, Your Highness.\"\n\n\nBy the fifth circuit, she is confident enough to release one hand and pat Hidalgo's neck. \"Good horse. Good Hidalgo. You walk very nice.\"\n\n\nHidalgo's ears flick back at her voice, and he gives a soft snort that might, in a horse, pass for acknowledgment.\n\n\nYou hear hoofbeats behind you—sharper, more energetic. You turn Hidalgo to see Lucia emerging from the stables on Tormenta.\n\n\nThe black mare is indeed spirited, tossing her head and dancing sideways as Lucia guides her into the courtyard. But Lucia sits her well—back straight, hands firm but not harsh on the reins, her seat secure. She brings Tormenta alongside you with a control that speaks of genuine skill, not mere competence.\n\n\n\"She is spirited,\" Lucia admits, slightly breathless. Her cheeks are flushed, her eyes bright. \"But she listens. She just needed to know I meant it.\"\n\n\nTormenta snorts and stamps, eyeing Hidalgo with the wariness of a mare assessing a much larger stallion. Hidalgo, for his part, ignores her entirely—the unflappable dignity of a veteran.\n\n\nCatalina stares at Lucia on the black horse, her mouth open.\n\n\n\"You look like a queen,\" she breathes."

They form up around you with practiced efficiency, three ahead and three behind, close enough for protection but far enough to allow conversation.\n\n\nYou guide Hidalgo through the gates of the Alcázar and down through Toledo's winding streets. The city rises on its granite promontory above the Tagus, and the road descends in switchbacks toward the river and the bridge beyond. Citizens stop and stare—their king, riding with a child before him and a striking dark-haired woman at his side. Word will spread through the city by evening. Let it.\n\n\n\"Catalina,\" you say, your voice close to her ear as Hidalgo picks his way down the cobblestones, \"we are going to ride out into the country. Do you see the river down there?\"\n\n\nShe cranes her neck, peering past Hidalgo's mane. \"The water?\"\n\n\n\"Yes. The river is called the Tagus. We will cross the bridge and ride along the other side, where there are farms and fields and olive groves. You will see where some of our food comes from.\"\n\n\n\"Olives?\" She perks up at a word she recognizes. \"I like olives.\"\n\n\n\"I know you do.\"\n\n\nYou reach the bridge—the Puente de Alcántara, ancient Roman stonework that has spanned the Tagus for over a thousand years. Hidalgo's hooves echo on the worn stones. Catalina watches the water flowing beneath with fascination.\n\n\n\"The water goes fast, Papá.\"\n\n\n\"It does. The Tagus flows all the way to the sea, far to the west. To Portugal, where your grandmother lives.\"\n\n\n\"Abuela?\" Catalina considers this. \"The water visits Abuela?\"\n\n\n\"In a manner of speaking.\"\n\n\nLucia rides up alongside you as you reach the far bank, Tormenta having settled into a more manageable energy now that she has space to move. The road opens before you—hard-packed earth winding through terraced hillsides dotted with olive trees, their silver-green leaves catching the November light.\n\n\n\"We will ride for perhaps an hour,\" you tell Catalina, \"and then rest and have something to eat. And then we will ride back. The whole time, you will be with Papá, safe on Hidalgo.\"\n\n\nYou glance at Lucia. \"And the Lady Lucia will ride with us, so she can see the land that will be her home.\"\n\n\nCatalina nods solemnly, as though she has been entrusted with a sacred duty.\n\n\n\"I will show her the olives,\" she announces."

They served Isabel. They love Isabel's children. This does not diminish me. I would be a fool to resent women who have cared for Catalina and Fernando when I was not yet here to do so.\"\n\n\nShe pauses, and her tone softens.\n\n\n\"In truth, I am grateful for them. Catalina knows their faces, their voices, their ways. She has already lost her mother. To strip away everyone familiar in favor of Italian strangers would be cruel. Children need continuity, Juan. Even when everything else changes.\"\n\n\nTormenta tosses her head, and Lucia settles her with a firm hand before continuing.\n\n\n\"Second—Constantinople.

Some of my Italians may prefer to remain in Toledo—Donna Beatrice is young and easily frightened, and Donna Isabella cares more for her needlework than for adventure.

This is a CHAOS ROLL for child development—determining what kind of person Catalina is becoming based on genetics, environment, and chance. Let me draft an appropriate table.\n\n\n\nPrincess Catalina: Early Childhood Development Roll\n\n\nContext: Catalina is now 19 months old. She has experienced both trauma (her mother's death when she was 10 months old) and extraordinary love (her father's devotion, the care of the Portuguese ladies, a stable household). Her personality is beginning to emerge.\n\n\nAge: 19 months (born January 28, 1432)\n\n\nTime Period Being Assessed: Her first 19 months of life\n\n\n\nFactors Influencing Development:\n\n\nPositive Factors (push toward favorable outcomes):\n\n\nJuan's devoted parenting — Present when possible, affectionate, playful, treats her as a person not just an heir\n\nStable household — Doña Beatriz and the Portuguese ladies provide consistent, loving care\n\nSurvived trauma intact — Mother died when she was 10 months old, but she was surrounded by people who continued to love her\n\nStimulating environment — Exposure to court life, travel, new people (Lucia), horses, the wider world\n\nSecure attachment — Clear bond with father, comfortable with caregivers\n\nGood physical health — No recorded illnesses, growing normally\n\n\nNegative/Uncertain Factors:\n\n\nLost mother at critical age — 10 months is old enough to notice absence, young enough that memory fades\n\nFather frequently absent — Juan was campaigning for much of her first year\n\nHigh expectations — She is a princess; pressure will only increase\n\nGenetic uncertainty — We don't know what Isabel's childhood temperament was, or Juan's\n\nMedieval childhood mortality/illness — Many things can go wrong\n\n\nNeutral Factors:\n\n\nGender — As a girl, she faces different expectations than a male heir would\n\nBirth order — She is the eldest, with a younger brother; this shapes family dynamics\n\n\n\nWhat This Roll Determines:\n\n\nThis roll establishes Catalina's emerging temperament and traits — the foundation of who she will become. It does not determine her entire future, but it sets the baseline for:\n\n\nIntelligence (quick-witted vs. average vs. slow)\n\nEmotional disposition (sunny vs. moody vs. volatile)\n\nSocial nature (outgoing vs. reserved vs. shy)\n\nPhysical constitution (robust vs. average vs. fragile)\n\nAny notable gifts or challenges\n\n\n\nD100 Table: Catalina's Early Development\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nTroubling Signs. Catalina is withdrawn, prone to tantrums that seem disproportionate, and slow to warm to new people or situations. She clings to familiar faces with desperate intensity and reacts poorly to change. The loss of her mother may have affected her more deeply than anyone realized. She is physically healthy but emotionally fragile. She will need extra patience, stability, and care.\n6-15\nSlow to Bloom. Catalina is quiet, watchful, slow to speak compared to other children her age. She is not unintelligent, but cautious—she observes before acting, holds back before engaging. She forms attachments slowly but deeply. Whether this is natural temperament or a response to early loss is unclear. She may blossom with time, or she may always be reserved. Physically average.\n16-30\nOrdinary Child. Catalina is a normal, healthy toddler—neither remarkably quick nor notably slow. She has good days and bad days, laughs and cries, tests boundaries and seeks comfort. She shows no particular gifts or challenges yet. She is attached to her father and caregivers, adapts reasonably well to new situations, and is developing at a typical pace. A blessing in its own way.\n31-50\nBright and Willful. Catalina shows clear intelligence—she learns new words quickly, remembers things she's told, and makes connections that surprise the adults around her. But she is also stubborn, with a strong will and clear preferences. She knows what she wants and protests when denied. This will make her a challenge to raise but may serve her well as an adult. Physically healthy and energetic.\n51-70\nWarm and Quick. Catalina combines genuine intelligence with a sunny, affectionate disposition. She is curious, eager to learn, quick to laugh, and forms bonds easily. She handled her mother's loss with remarkable resilience—sad at times, but not broken. She adapts well to new situations (as seen with Lucia and the Italian ladies). A genuinely delightful child who brings joy to those around her. Robust health.\n71-85\nExceptional Child. Catalina displays notably advanced development—speaking in complex sentences earlier than expected, demonstrating memory and reasoning that surprise even experienced caregivers. She combines this intelligence with emotional warmth and social confidence. She is brave (approaching Hidalgo, accepting Lucia), generous (sharing olives), and adaptable. The Portuguese ladies remark that she reminds them of Isabel at her best. Excellent health and physical coordination.\n86-95\nRemarkable in Every Way. Catalina is extraordinary—the kind of child who makes adults pause and reassess what toddlers are capable of. Her intelligence is obvious but not cold; she combines quick understanding with genuine empathy. She reads emotions, comforts others, and navigates social situations with uncanny grace for her age. She has processed her mother's absence in ways that would be mature for a much older child. Physically robust, coordinated, and fearless. People who meet her remember her.\n96-100\nA Gift from God. Catalina is one of those rare children who seem touched by something beyond ordinary human capacity. Her intelligence borders on unsettling—she understands things no toddler should grasp, remembers everything, and sometimes says things that make adults wonder if she sees more than they do. But this is paired with profound kindness, an almost supernatural warmth that draws people to her. She is healthy, beautiful, brave, and wise beyond her years. Whether this is divine blessing or simply extraordinary genetics, she is destined to be remarkable. Those who believe in signs will see one in her.\n\n\nReady for the roll, Your Majesty."

      "say": "Roll: 59 — Warm and Quick\n\n\n\nLucia accepts the olives with appropriate ceremony, cupping her hands to receive them as Catalina deposits her treasure with painstaking care.\n\n\n\"These are beautiful,\" Lucia says, examining them with the gravity the moment deserves. \"You picked these yourself? From the tree?\"\n\n\n\"From the tree,\" Catalina confirms, nodding vigorously. \"They live there. I didn't know.\"\n\n\nShe settles onto the blanket between you and Lucia, reaching immediately for the bread and cheese. Her legs stick out in front of her, still slightly unsteady from the ride, and she chatters as she eats—a stream of observations about the horses, the hawk she saw, the olive trees, the funny way Tormenta tossed her head.\n\n\nYou watch her, and you see it clearly now—what the Portuguese ladies have surely noticed, what Doña Beatriz must report in her quiet way. Catalina is not merely recovering from the loss of her mother. She is thriving.\n\n\nShe learned Lucia's name after hearing it once and has not forgotten it. She remembers the promise of crostatas from this morning and connected it to the concept of \"special bread\" for future negotiations. When Hidalgo frightened her, she mastered her fear within minutes. When presented with six strange Italian women, she conducted her own inspection and rendered judgment. She accepted Lucia into her world with remarkable speed—not indiscriminate trust, but genuine openness.\n\n\nShe is curious about everything. Why do olives grow on trees? Where does the water go? What is the ship's name? The questions tumble out faster than you can answer them, each answer spawning three more questions.\n\n\nAnd beneath the curiosity, there is warmth. She offered Lucia a hug this morning without prompting—a gift freely given. She wanted Lucia to come on \"her\" ship. She picked olives not to eat herself, but to give.\n\n\nShe laughs easily, recovers quickly from small upsets, and seems to genuinely enjoy meeting new people rather than fearing them. The trauma of losing Isabel at ten months old has not broken her. Perhaps she was too young to fully understand; perhaps she was surrounded by enough love that the wound healed cleanly; perhaps she simply has a resilient spirit.\n\n\nWhatever the cause, the daughter sitting between you and Lucia—olive juice on her fingers, crumbs on her dress, dark hair escaping its ribbons—is a bright, affectionate, quick-witted child who adapts readily to new situations and forms bonds with genuine ease.\n\n\nLucia catches your eye over Catalina's head. She has seen it too.\n\n\n\"She is...\" Lucia pauses, searching for the right word. \"She is sunshine, Juan. How did you make such a child?\"\n\n\nCatalina looks up at the word, frowning slightly.\n\n\n\"I'm not sunshine,\" she objects. \"I'm Catalina.\""

      "say": "The ride back to Toledo passes peacefully. Catalina falls asleep against your chest before you reach the bridge, lulled by Hidalgo's steady rhythm and the exhaustion of a day filled with new experiences. You carry her up to the nursery yourself, surrendering her to Doña Beatriz only when she is safely deposited in her small bed.\n\n\n\nNovember 11-13, 1433 — Preparations\n\n\nThe next two days blur with activity.\n\n\nÁlvaro dispatches the letters you ordered—to Commander Martín in Morocco with instructions and trade goods, to the Council of Great Houses with thanks and the consultation request regarding Granada. Heralds ride out to Burgos, Seville, Córdoba, and Granada bearing news of the royal betrothal.\n\n\nThe Archbishop meets with you and Lucia separately and together, reviewing the ceremony, confirming the traditional vows, ensuring all canonical requirements are satisfied. He is an old man, careful and precise, and he takes evident pleasure in presiding over a happy occasion after years of war and uncertainty.\n\n\nLucia's household integrates with the Alcázar's rhythms. Donna Francesca has established a working alliance with the royal kitchens; the crostatas appear at breakfast now alongside the Castilian bread and olives, a small diplomatic victory. The Italian ladies explore Toledo in pairs, chaperoned by guards, returning with observations about the city's Moorish architecture and its famous steel.\n\n\nCatalina visits Lucia's apartments daily, drawn by the promise of sweets and the company of women who make much of her. She has learned all six names now and delivers judgments on each: Donna Isabella's embroidery is \"pretty,\" Donna Caterina's books are \"boring,\" young Donna Beatrice is \"nice but quiet.\"\n\n\nFernando, at ten weeks, remains oblivious to the excitement—sleeping, eating, occasionally fixing his dark eyes on whoever holds him with the unfocused intensity of infancy.\n\n\n\nSunday, November 13, 1433 — The Betrothal\n\n\nThe Cathedral of Toledo fills before dawn.\n\n\nWord has spread through the city, and citizens crowd the plaza outside, hoping for a glimpse of their king and his Italian bride. Inside, the great families of Castile assemble in their finest—velvets and silks, gold chains and family jewels, the accumulated splendor of a kingdom celebrating peace after generations of war.\n\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza sits with his family in a place of honor. The Enríquez contingent occupies another section. You note, with quiet satisfaction, that Don Pedro Fernández de Velasco has come from Burgos—the first time the Count of Haro has attended a royal ceremony since your coronation. He catches your eye and inclines his head, his weathered face unreadable.\n\n\nThe altar blazes with candles. Archbishop Alonso de Toledo waits in his ceremonial vestments, ancient and solemn.\n\n\nYou stand before the assembled court in cloth-of-gold, your father's sword at your side. The True Cross fragment and Santiago's bone rest on the altar—the relics you carried to Rome and back, now witnessing another sacred moment.\n\n\nA murmur ripples through the cathedral. The doors have opened.\n\n\nLucia enters on the arm of Don Íñigo, who has been granted the honor of escorting her in the absence of her uncle. She wears a gown of deep blue velvet embroidered with silver stars—the colors of Ferrara, but also of the Virgin. A thin circlet of gold sits on her dark hair. She carries no flowers, no ornament but the sapphire ring already on her finger.\n\n\nShe walks the length of the cathedral with her head high, her grey-green eyes fixed on you.\n\n\nThe Archbishop raises his hands.\n\n\n\"We are gathered in the sight of God and these witnesses to join this man and this woman in the sacred promise of betrothal...\"\n\n\n\nThe ceremony is brief and ancient. The Archbishop asks the questions required by canon law. You answer: \"I do so promise.\" Lucia answers the same, her voice clear and steady. You take the ring from her finger—the ring you gave her in the moonlit garden—and place it there again, publicly this time, before God and Castile.\n\n\n\"Before these witnesses,\" the Archbishop intones, \"I pronounce you betrothed, bound by sacred promise to wed according to the rites of Holy Mother Church. What God has begun, let no man put asunder.\"\n\n\nThe cathedral erupts. \"Vivat! Vivat Rey Juan! Vivat Lady Lucia!\"\n\n\nLucia's hand trembles slightly in yours. When you look at her face, her eyes are bright with unshed tears—but she is smiling.\n\n\n\"Trapped,\" she whispers, so only you can hear.\n\n\n\nThe Reception\n\n\nThe great hall of the Alcázar has been transformed. Musicians play in the gallery. Wine flows freely. Tables groan with food—Castilian and Italian dishes side by side, a culinary alliance to match the matrimonial one.\n\n\nCatalina, in a gown of pale yellow that matches the autumn chrysanthemums decorating the hall, sits in a place of honor with Doña Beatriz hovering nearby. She has been very quiet during the ceremony, as promised, and now eyes the table with naked anticipation.\n\n\n\"Papá,\" she whispers loudly as you pass. \"Crostatas?\"\n\n\nLucia laughs and produces one from somewhere—Donna Francesca's doing, no doubt—pressing it into Catalina's eager hands.\n\n\n\"As promised, little one. You earned it.\"\n\n\nThe nobles line up to offer their congratulations. Don Íñigo speaks of the honor of escorting the lady. Don Pedro Velasco—gruff, brief—wishes you happiness and withdraws before you can engage him further, but the fact of his presence speaks louder than words. The Italian ladies flutter around Lucia like bright-plumed birds, alternating between tears and laughter.\n\n\nThe evening stretches on. There is dancing—you lead Lucia through the steps of a pavane, her hand light in yours, her movements graceful despite unfamiliarity with Castilian forms. There is music and wine and the happy noise of a court celebrating.\n\n\nAnd through it all, Lucia stays at your side, her ring catching the candlelight, her sharp tongue softened for once into simple happiness.\n\n\n\"Three weeks,\" she murmurs as the evening winds toward its end. \"Three weeks until I am truly yours.\"\n\n\n\nThe betrothal is complete. The wedding is set for Saturday, December 3rd, 1433.\n\n\nWhat would you like to do in the intervening weeks, Your Majesty?"

They are no longer in Toledo.\n\n\n\nThe Weeks Between — November 1433\n\n\nThe days settle into a rhythm. Mornings find you in the stables with Catalina, lifting her onto Hidalgo's back before mounting behind her. She has grown bolder with each ride—no longer gripping the pommel with white-knuckled terror, but sitting straighter, sometimes releasing one hand to pat Hidalgo's neck or point at something that catches her eye.\n\n\n\"Faster, Papá?\" she asks hopefully, every time.\n\n\n\"Not yet, little one.\"\n\n\nThe stable master is a grizzled man named Pedro Carrillo, who has served the royal stables for thirty years and trained horses for your father before you. He watches your daily rides with Catalina from the courtyard, arms folded, professional eye assessing.\n\n\nWhen you pose your question, he strokes his grey beard thoughtfully.\n\n\n\"For sitting a horse with an adult, as Your Majesty does now? She is already learning—balance, rhythm, comfort with the animal. This is good. The earlier they lose their fear, the better.\"\n\n\nHe holds up a calloused finger.\n\n\n\"For a pony of her own, with a lead rope held by a groom? Three years old, Your Majesty. Some say four, but I have seen children of three take to it well, if they have the temperament. The princess...\" He glances toward the stables where Catalina is currently attempting to feed Hidalgo an apple nearly as large as her head. \"She has no fear. That is half the battle.\"\n\n\nA second finger rises.\n\n\n\"For riding independently, without a lead? Five or six, depending on the child. Short distances, gentle ponies, always supervised. By eight or nine, if she takes to it, she could ride properly—hunts, hawking, travel.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, choosing his next words carefully.\n\n\n\"There is a mare in the stables, Your Majesty. Andalusian, but small—fourteen hands only. Gentle disposition, good with noise and confusion. She was meant for Queen Isabel, before...\" He clears his throat. \"She has been idle too long. In a year or so, she might suit the princess for her first pony. With your permission, I could begin training her for a child's temperament.\""

What we want is a Castilian pony, twelve hands or less—sturdy, calm, forgiving of mistakes. They are not rare, but a good one, one worthy of a princess...\" He shrugs. \"That takes time to find.

Tormenta stamps and tosses her head, sensing activity, her black coat gleaming in the afternoon light. The mare has settled somewhat in the days since her arrival—she and Lucia have reached an understanding—but she still carries herself with that restless energy that speaks of spirit barely contained.\n\n\nYou lift Catalina up first. She is lighter than a sack of grain, and you settle her onto the saddle in front of where Lucia will sit. Her small hands immediately grasp the pommel.\n\n\n\"Hold tight,\" you remind her.\n\n\n\"I know, Papá.\"\n\n\nLucia mounts behind her with practiced grace, her arms coming around Catalina to take the reins, creating the same protective cage you form when riding with her on Hidalgo. Catalina leans back against Lucia's chest, looking up at her with absolute trust.\n\n\n\"I am ready,\" she announces.\n\n\nYou swing up onto Hidalgo, settling into the familiar saddle. Your destrier stands calm and solid beside the more volatile Tormenta—a steady grey mountain next to a dancing black flame.\n\n\nThe same escort assembles—Sergeant Tomás and his six men, falling into formation around you with the ease of long practice.\n\n\nLucia meets your eyes across the space between your horses. Catalina sits before her, small and fearless, already reaching to touch Tormenta's mane with gentle, curious fingers.\n\n\n\"Where shall we ride, Your Majesty?\" Lucia asks. \"The princess and I await your command.\""

Citizens bow and step aside as you pass—their king, the Italian lady who will soon be queen, and the small princess perched before her like a figurehead on a ship's prow.\n\n\nCatalina twists and turns, trying to see everything at once, her running commentary floating back to you: \"Look, Lucia, a dog! And that man has bread! So much bread! Why does he have so much bread?\"\n\n\nLucia answers each observation with patience, her voice warm with amusement.\n\n\nOnce through the gates and across the bridge, the road opens before you. The November afternoon is crisp and clear, the olive groves giving way to open fields where farmers have finished the autumn harvest. Stubble stretches toward the horizon, golden-brown under the pale sun.\n\n\nYou turn Hidalgo off the main road onto a cart track that runs between fallow fields. The ground here is firm and level—good footing for horses, safe enough for a faster pace.\n\n\nSergeant Tomás reads your intention and signals his men to spread out, giving you room while maintaining their protective cordon.\n\n\nYou glance at Lucia. Tormenta is already dancing beneath her, sensing the open space, eager to run.\n\n\n\"Ready?\" you call.\n\n\nCatalina bounces in the saddle. \"Fast now, Papá?

The black mare leaps forward eagerly, matching Hidalgo's pace with evident joy. Lucia rides beautifully—back straight, hands steady, moving with the horse rather than against her. Whatever education Ferrara provided, it included genuine horsemanship.\n\n\nAnd between Lucia's arms, Catalina shrieks.\n\n\nNot with fear—with pure, unbridled delight. The sound rings across the empty fields, startling a flock of crows from a nearby tree. Her dark hair streams back, her small hands grip the pommel, and her face is transformed by wonder.\n\n\n\"FAST!\" she cries. \"We're going FAST, Papá!\"\n\n\nThe horses run side by side, grey and black, their hooves drumming against the hard-packed earth. The wind bites at your cheeks, carrying the smell of autumn fields and horse sweat. Behind you, the escort matches your pace, Sergeant Tomás keeping his men in disciplined formation despite the sudden burst of speed.\n\n\nLucia is laughing—real laughter, unguarded and free, the sharp-tongued Italian noblewoman stripped away to reveal something younger and lighter beneath.\n\n\n\"She's a natural!\" she calls across to you, her voice nearly lost in the wind. \"Feel how she moves with the horse!\"\n\n\nIt's true. Catalina has stopped fighting Tormenta's rhythm and begun to flow with it, her small body instinctively finding the balance that Pedro Carrillo noticed.

His stride lengthens, his hooves thunder against the earth, and the world blurs into streaks of brown and gold. The wind roars in your ears, whipping your cloak behind you, and for a moment you are not a king weighed down by treaties and councils and the fate of nations. You are simply a man on a horse, running.\n\n\nBehind you, Lucia gives Tormenta her head.\n\n\nThe black mare surges forward, her competitive spirit ignited by Hidalgo's challenge.

The sky arches overhead. Your daughter is safe in the arms of a woman who is learning to love her.\n\n\nAnd somewhere in the back of your mind, a thought surfaces unbidden: This is what I am fighting for. This.

Infantry command and siege craft. And—\" He gestures toward a separate building. \"—the new arts. Gunpowder. Artillery.

Banners in the colors of Castile and Ferrara hang from every tower. Merchants arrive from across the kingdom, their carts laden with goods for the celebrations. The streets fill with nobles and their retinues, each great house seeking lodging closer to the Alcázar than their rivals.\n\n\nThe Military Order Masters arrive as Álvaro predicted—Don Luis de Guzmán of Santiago, Don Pedro González de Padilla of Calatrava, and Don Juan de Sotomayor of Alcántara. They attend you in council, reviewing the intelligence from Morocco and the reports from Constantinople. The discussions are substantive but inconclusive; you agree to finalize the expedition plans after the wedding, when minds are clearer and the festivities have passed.\n\n\nLucia's days are consumed by her ladies, by fittings for her wedding gown, by the endless protocols of becoming a queen. You steal what moments you can—a shared meal here, an evening walk through the Alcázar gardens there. Catalina serves as your excuse and your chaperone, delighted to have both her Papá and her Lucia together.\n\n\nThe formal betrothal has changed something between you. There is an ease now, a settled certainty. Lucia's sharp tongue remains, but softer edges show through—a hand that lingers on your arm, a glance held a moment too long, a laugh that comes more freely.\n\n\nOne evening, as you walk together through the torchlit corridors, Catalina asleep in your arms, Lucia speaks quietly of her mother. You listen. And later, haltingly, you speak of Isabel—not a eulogy, as Fray Hernando warned against, but fragments. Her laugh. Her faith. The way she held Catalina in the first moments after birth, weeping with joy.\n\n\nLucia listens. She does not compare. She does not compete. She simply holds the memory you offer, and when you finish, she takes your hand and says nothing at all—which is exactly right.\n\n\n\nDecember 3rd, 1433 — The Wedding\n\n\nThe dawn breaks cold and clear.\n\n\nYou wake before the sun fully rises, lying alone in your chambers for the last time as an unmarried man. Through the window, the sky shifts from black to deep blue to pale gold. Somewhere in the city, bells begin to ring—first one church, then another, until all of Toledo seems to sing.\n\n\nYour body servants dress you in layers of ceremony: white linen, then cloth-of-gold, then a surcoat of deep crimson embroidered with the castles and lions of your house. Your father's sword hangs at your side. A golden circlet rests on your brow—not the heavy crown of state, but something older, simpler, worn by Castilian kings at their weddings for generations.\n\n\nÁlvaro comes to escort you, his weathered face unusually solemn.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty. It is time.\"\n\n\n\nThe Cathedral of Toledo\n\n\nThe great cathedral is transformed.\n\n\nThousands of candles blaze from every surface, their light catching the gold leaf of the altarpiece, the jeweled vestments of the clergy, the silks and velvets of the assembled nobility. The air is thick with incense and the scent of winter flowers—roses brought at tremendous expense from somewhere that still grows them, white lilies, branches of evergreen.\n\n\nEvery great family of Castile has come. Don Íñigo López de Mendoza sits with his household. Don Pedro Velasco—the Count of Haro—has returned from Burgos, his presence a quiet testament to the reconciliation begun at Fernando's baptism. The Enríquez, the Guzmán, the Manrique—all present, all watching.\n\n\nThe Military Order Masters occupy places of honor, their white mantles bright against the darker colors of the secular lords. Foreign ambassadors cluster in their designated section—Aragonese, Portuguese, Venetian, Florentine, a representative from the Emperor Sigismund himself.\n\n\nArchbishop Alonso de Toledo waits at the altar, ancient and magnificent in his ceremonial robes.\n\n\nAnd then—\n\n\nThe doors open.\n\n\nLucia enters on the arm of Don Íñigo, who once again has been granted the honor of escorting her. She wears a gown of white silk embroidered with silver stars, the colors of the Virgin, of purity, of Ferrara's night sky. A veil of delicate lace covers her dark hair, held in place by a circlet of pearls. She carries no flowers—only the sapphire ring on her finger, catching the candlelight with each step.\n\n\nShe walks the length of the cathedral with her head high, her grey-green eyes fixed on you.\n\n\nThe congregation rises.\n\n\nAnd in that moment, as Lucia draws closer and the music swells and the incense rises toward heaven, you think of Isabel—not with grief, but with gratitude. For the love she gave you. For the daughter she left behind. For the blessing she would offer, if she could, to the woman who will now stand where she once stood.\n\n\nLucia reaches the altar. Don Íñigo releases her arm and steps back. She turns to face you.\n\n\nThe Archbishop raises his hands.\n\n\n\"Dearly beloved, we are gathered in the sight of God and this congregation to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony...\"\n\n\n\nThe vows are ancient, unchanging—the same words spoken by your father and his father before him.\n\n\n\"I, Juan, take thee, Lucia, to be my wedded wife. To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth.\"\n\n\nLucia's voice is steady, clear, carrying to the far reaches of the cathedral:\n\n\n\"I, Lucia, take thee, Juan, to be my wedded husband. To have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love, cherish, and obey, till death us do part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I give thee my troth.\"\n\n\nThe rings are exchanged—yours a simple band of gold, hers the sapphire ring returned once more to her finger, now blessed and sanctified.\n\n\nThe Archbishop's voice rises:\n\n\n\"Those whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. I pronounce that they be man and wife together, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\"\n\n\nThe cathedral erupts.\n\n\n\"VIVAT REX JUAN! VIVAT REGINA LUCIA!\"\n\n\nAnd then Lucia is in your arms, her veil pushed back, her lips meeting yours as the bells of Toledo ring out across the city, across the kingdom, carrying the news to every corner of Castile:\n\n\nThe King has taken a Queen.\n\n\n\nThe Feast\n\n\nThe great hall of the Alcázar surpasses even the betrothal reception. Tables groan with food—Castilian and Italian dishes mingled together, wines from every province, sweets that Donna Francesca has spent weeks preparing. Musicians play in the galleries. Nobles dance and drink and toast the health of the new Queen.\n\n\nCatalina, in a gown of pale gold that matches the King's surcoat, sits in a place of honor with Doña Beatriz beside her. She has been very good through the long ceremony—a feat of toddler endurance that will be rewarded with more crostatas than are strictly advisable.\n\n\nWhen you pass her table, she tugs at your sleeve.\n\n\n\"Papá,\" she whispers loudly. \"Lucia is pretty.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, she is.\"\n\n\n\"She is ours now?\"\n\n\nYou kneel beside her chair, heedless of your magnificent robes.\n\n\n\"Yes, little one. She is ours now.\"\n\n\nCatalina nods with satisfaction, as though she personally arranged the matter.\n\n\n\"Good,\" she says. \"I like her.\"\n\n\n\nThe evening stretches long. There is dancing—you lead Lucia through the steps, her hand warm in yours, her eyes bright with joy and exhaustion. There are toasts—from Álvaro, from Don Íñigo, from the Military Order Masters, from ambassadors speaking flowery words in languages you barely understand.\n\n\nAnd finally, as the candles burn low and the guests begin to drift away, Álvaro appears at your elbow.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty. Your Grace.\" He bows to each of you in turn. \"The hour grows late. The bridal chamber has been prepared.\"\n\n\nLucia's hand tightens on yours. Her cheeks flush—whether from wine or anticipation, you cannot tell.\n\n\nThe court watches as you lead your bride from the hall.\n\n\nThe door closes behind you.\n\n\nAnd at last, you are alone."

As they work, you explain the situation to Lucia, who listens from the bed, wrapped in silks, her sharp mind absorbing every detail.\n\n\nThe Church is fractured, you tell her. Pope Eugenius IV sits in Rome, but his authority is contested by the Council of Basel, which claims that a general council of the Church holds authority superior to any pope. The conciliarists at Basel push for reforms—limits on papal power, restrictions on benefices, an end to certain abuses—while Eugenius resists what he sees as an assault on the very foundations of papal supremacy.\n\n\nCastile has walked a careful line. Fray Hernando led your delegation at Basel with skill, positioning Castile as a moderate voice—supportive of genuine reform, but not hostile to papal authority. Cardinal Cesarini, the papal legate presiding over the Council, has consulted with your delegation repeatedly. Your conquest of Granada has given Castile moral weight that few other kingdoms can claim.\n\n\nThe situation with Constantinople complicates everything. The Byzantine Emperor desperately needs Western aid against the Ottomans, but he also needs Church unity—specifically, reunion between the Eastern and Western churches. Both Rome and Basel want to host the negotiations for this reunion, each hoping to claim the prestige of healing the ancient schism.\n\n\nYour task in Rome is delicate: maintain the Pope's trust and support while also advocating for genuine reform, secure backing for the Constantinople expedition, and avoid being drawn into the factional war between papal and conciliar parties.\n\n\nLucia asks questions as you dress—sharp, probing questions that reveal how quickly she grasps the political dimensions. By the time you are fully attired, she has begun forming her own assessments.\n\n\n\"So we need the Pope's blessing for Constantinople,\" she summarizes, rising to call for her own ladies, \"but we cannot appear to be his creature, or we lose influence at Basel. And we need Basel's reform energy, but we cannot openly defy Rome, or we lose the Pope's support for the expedition.\"\n\n\nShe shakes her head, a wry smile crossing her face.\n\n\n\"And I thought Ferrarese politics were complicated.\"\n\n\n\nBreakfast with Catalina\n\n\nThe private dining chamber is warm, a fire crackling against the December chill. Catalina sits at the table, her feet dangling above the floor, attacking a crostata with determined enthusiasm. Doña Beatriz hovers nearby, ready to intervene against the worst excesses of toddler dining.\n\n\nWhen you and Lucia enter together, Catalina looks up, her face smeared with honey and crumbs.\n\n\n\"Papá! Lucia!\" She bounces in her seat, then frowns slightly, studying you both with the intense scrutiny only a child can muster. \"You are wearing the same colors.\"\n\n\nIt is true—you had not planned it, but Lucia has chosen a morning gown of deep burgundy that complements your own doublet.\n\n\nCatalina nods approvingly, as though she has personally arranged this coordination.\n\n\n\"Good,\" she pronounces. \"Now you match. Like... like a set.\"\n\n\nShe returns her attention to the crostata, the matter settled.\n\n\nLucia takes the seat beside her, accepting a cup of watered wine from a servant. Across the table, her eyes meet yours—warm, amused, and full of promise.\n\n\nYour family. Your queen. Your daughter.\n\n\nThe work continues."

Can Lucia take me to see Tormenta?\").\n\n\nLucia handles each pronouncement with patience and genuine warmth, promising that yes, they can visit Tormenta later, after the grown-ups attend to some boring matters first.\n\n\n\"Boring matters?\" Catalina wrinkles her nose. \"What boring matters?\"\n\n\n\"Clothes,\" Lucia says solemnly. \"Lots and lots of clothes.\"\n\n\nCatalina considers this. \"Can I have new clothes too?\"\n\n\n\"You,\" Lucia says, tapping her nose gently, \"will have the best new clothes. Clothes that match Papá and me. So we all look like a set.\"\n\n\nCatalina beams, the promise of inclusion smoothing over any disappointment about delayed horse visits.\n\n\n\nThe Clothiers\n\n\nBy mid-morning, the royal chambers have been transformed into a workshop of fabrics and sketches.\n\n\nMaster Gonzalo de Ávila—Toledo's finest tailor, who dressed your father and has dressed you since childhood—arrives with two assistants bearing bolts of cloth. He is joined by Donna Francesca, who has taken it upon herself to coordinate Lucia's wardrobe and has brought fabric samples from the Italian merchants who followed the Ferrarese delegation.\n\n\nThe two regard each other with the wary respect of professionals who recognize a rival's competence.\n\n\n\"Your Majesties,\" Master Gonzalo begins, bowing low. \"I understand you wish to commission garments that... complement one another?\"\n\n\nHe glances between you and Lucia, his experienced eye already calculating cuts and colors.\n\n\nDonna Francesca steps forward, a sketch in hand. \"In Ferrara, the Duke and Duchess often appear in coordinated attire for formal occasions. Not identical, but harmonious. The same palette, similar motifs, fabrics that speak to one another.\"\n\n\nShe lays out the sketch—a rough drawing showing a man and woman side by side, their garments distinct but clearly part of a unified vision.\n\n\n\"For His Majesty in armor,\" she continues, \"we must consider what colors and fabrics will stand beside steel without being overwhelmed. Gold, certainly. Deep reds. Perhaps black for contrast.\"\n\n\nMaster Gonzalo nods slowly, professional pride overcoming territorial instinct. \"The Queen should not attempt to match armor directly—that would appear martial, which sends the wrong message. Instead, she should complement it. Where the King shows strength through steel, the Queen shows strength through presence. Structured gowns, rich fabrics, colors that command attention without competing.\"\n\n\nHe turns to Lucia. \"Your Grace, may I ask—do you favor high collars or lower necklines? Fitted sleeves or flowing? These details will determine the overall silhouette.\"\n\n\nLucia glances at you, then back to the tailor. \"High collars. Fitted sleeves. Nothing that impedes movement or suggests fragility.\" A slight smile. \"I am told I am to learn to command. I should look the part.\"\n\n\nMaster Gonzalo's eyebrows rise slightly—approval, perhaps, at a client who knows her own mind.\n\n\n\"And for the Princess?\" Donna Francesca asks. \"The little one should be included, yes?\"\n\n\nCatalina, who has been brought in by Doña Beatriz to observe, perks up at the mention of her name.\n\n\n\"I want red,\" she announces firmly. \"Like Papá's sword-coat.\""

It speaks of acceptance, of family unity, without words.\"\n\n\nShe holds up her sketch—a woman and small child in matching gowns, simplified for the child's proportions but clearly part of the same design.\n\n\n\"For formal receptions,\" Master Gonzalo continues, warming to the subject, \"when Your Majesties receive nobles, I would propose the following:\"\n\n\nHe begins laying out fabric samples on the table.\n\n\n\"For His Majesty: a doublet of deep crimson velvet, embroidered with the castles and lions of Castile in gold thread. Over this, a surcoat of cloth-of-gold with a high collar. No armor for indoor receptions—it creates distance—but the sword, always. The sword speaks of authority without threat when worn at court.\"\n\n\nHe moves to another set of fabrics.\n\n\n\"For Her Majesty the Queen: a gown of the same crimson velvet, with cloth-of-gold accents at the bodice and sleeves. A high collar, as she prefers, with a subtle pattern of Ferrarese stars worked in silver thread alongside the Castilian arms. This honors her origins while declaring her new allegiance. Structured silhouette, a small train—enough to command space, not so much as to impede movement.\"\n\n\nDonna Francesca takes over, gesturing to lighter fabrics.\n\n\n\"For the Princess: the same crimson, but in softer wool rather than heavy velvet—more suitable for a child. A simplified version of the Queen's gown, with the same gold accents. Perhaps a small circlet for her hair, matching one worn by the Queen.\"\n\n\nShe smiles at Catalina, who is listening with intense concentration.\n\n\n\"The effect, when all three stand together, will be unmistakable: the King in his strength, the Queen in her grace, and the Princess as the promise of the future. A dynasty, Your Majesty. Not merely a family.\"\n\n\nMaster Gonzalo clears his throat. \"For variation, we could prepare similar ensembles in other colors—deep blue with silver, black with gold, forest green with bronze. This allows Your Majesties to appear coordinated at multiple events without seeming to own only one set of clothes.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, awaiting your response.\n\n\nCatalina tugs at Doña Beatriz's hand. \"I want the red one,\" she whispers loudly. \"The red one first.\""

For occasions when Your Majesty appears in armor—war councils, military reviews, receiving victorious commanders. Her Majesty the Queen in structured cloth-of-gold with crimson accents, high collar, a gown that speaks of strength and command without competing with steel. The Princess in a simplified version—gold with crimson ribbons, perhaps. The message: the King rides to war, but the crown endures.\"\n\n\nHe moves to the second set of fabrics.\n\n\n\"Second: The Formal Set. Deep crimson velvet with gold embroidery, as we discussed. For receiving ambassadors, presiding over court, formal audiences with the great families. Heavy fabrics, rich colors, the full weight of majesty on display. The Queen and Princess as mirrors of one another, the King as their complement. This is the image of dynasty—of a house built to last generations.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to lighter materials—softer wools, subtle silks in muted tones.\n\n\n\"Third: The Informal Set. For private audiences, smaller gatherings, meetings with trusted advisors where ease matters more than intimidation. I would suggest...\" He holds up a fabric of deep blue-grey, the color of a winter sky. \"Something in this range. Elegant but not overwhelming. Fitted but comfortable. Silver accents rather than gold—refined rather than bold.\"\n\n\nDonna Francesca adds, \"For the Queen, a gown with a softer silhouette—still structured, but less rigid. Hair worn more simply. For the Princess, something she can move freely in, play in if needed, without fear of damaging precious fabrics.\"\n\n\nShe smiles. \"The message of the informal set is different: we trust you enough to show you who we are when we are not performing. This is a gift to those who receive it.\"\n\n\nMaster Gonzalo bows. \"With Your Majesty's approval, we can begin work immediately. The formal crimson set can be ready within the week. The martial set will take longer—we must coordinate with Your Majesty's armorer to ensure the colors complement the specific steel. The informal set...\" He glances at Donna Francesca. \"Ten days, perhaps?\"\n\n\nCatalina, who has been remarkably patient, tugs at Lucia's sleeve.\n\n\n\"Lucia,\" she whispers. \"Will we really match?\""

She tugs at Lucia's skirts until the woman kneels down again.\n\n\nThen Catalina throws her small arms around Lucia's neck and squeezes with all the strength her nineteen-month-old body can muster.

The Orders have always been cavalry, heavy horse, fortress garrisons. Ships require different skills, different men, different traditions.\" He pauses. \"Santiago has some experience with coastal defense, but true naval warfare? Galleys, marines, naval tactics? We would need to learn. To adapt.\"\n\n\nDon Pedro grunts. \"Calatrava has no ships. No sailors. We are horsemen.\"\n\n\nDon Juan de Zúñiga tilts his head thoughtfully. \"And yet... if the next crusade is Constantinople, the path there is by sea. If Morocco is to be contested, it is across the Strait. If the Ottomans are the enemy, their navy is as dangerous as their armies.\" He looks at you directly. \"Perhaps the Orders must become naval powers, whether we wish it or not.\"\n\n\nThe room falls silent, the weight of institutional transformation hanging in the air."

Fourteen secondary fortifications—smaller castles and fortified towers controlling mountain passes and river crossings. Eight fortified ports along the coast: Málaga, Almería, Almuñécar, Motril, Adra, Vera, Mojácar, and Marbella.\"\n\n\nHe sets down the paper.\n\n\n\"Additionally, there are perhaps thirty to forty minor watchtowers and signal posts throughout the Sierra Nevada and along the coastal roads. These are of limited military value individually, but together they form a network for early warning and communication.\"\n\n\nHe glances at the Masters.\n\n\n\"The ports are of particular interest. Málaga is already developing as a major Mediterranean trading hub—Your Majesty will recall the commerce initiative we discussed. Almería has deep water and could harbor a significant fleet. The others are smaller but useful for coastal patrol and defense against Barbary raiders.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, choosing his next words carefully.\n\n\n\"If Your Majesty were considering granting some of these fortifications to the Orders, the question becomes: which ones, and under what terms? Fortresses in the interior offer the Orders a continued land-based mission—suppressing banditry, overseeing the Christian settlement of conquered territories, maintaining order among the remaining Moorish population. Coastal fortifications and ports, however...\" He nods toward Don Juan de Zúñiga. \"...would push the Orders toward the naval transformation the Commander mentioned.\"\n\n\nHe folds his hands.\n\n\n\"The crown need not grant all or nothing. A careful distribution might serve multiple purposes: rewarding the Orders for their service in the conquest, giving them renewed purpose, while retaining strategic assets—particularly the major ports—under direct royal control.\""

But the greater damage is indirect. Merchants now demand higher fees for the risk, or refuse certain routes entirely.

      "say": "Catalina considers this question with the gravity it deserves, her small face scrunched in thought. She looks at you, then at Lucia, then back at you—weighing loyalties, calculating advantages, negotiating the complex politics of a toddler's heart.\n\n\n\"I ride with Lucia-mama to the stable,\" she announces, having apparently devised a compromise worthy of a seasoned diplomat. \"And then I ride with Papá on Hidalgo. And then—\" she holds up a finger to forestall any objection, \"—I ride with Lucia-mama on Tormenta on the way back.\"\n\n\nShe nods firmly, satisfied with this arrangement.\n\n\n\"That way it is fair,\" she explains, in case the adults have failed to grasp the elegant logic of her solution.\n\n\nLucia laughs, reaching out to take Catalina from your arms.\n\n\n\"The princess drives a hard bargain,\" she says, settling the child on her hip with a naturalness that speaks of how quickly she has adapted to this role. \"Very well. I accept these terms.\"\n\n\nCatalina wraps her arms around Lucia's neck, then twists to look back at you.\n\n\n\"Come on, Papá,\" she urges. \"The horses are waiting.\"\n\n\n\nThe three of you make your way through the Alcázar and out into the courtyard, where the late afternoon sun casts long shadows across the cobblestones. December has brought a chill to the air, but the sky is clear and bright—good weather for riding.\n\n\nCatalina chatters the entire way, informing Lucia about the various horses in the stable, their names, their temperaments, and which ones are \"nice\" and which ones are \"grumpy.\"\n\n\n\"Hidalgo is the best,\" she confides. \"But Tormenta is also the best. They are both the best.\""

Catalina shrieks with delight, pressed safely against your chest, her small hands gripping the pommel with white-knuckled excitement.\n\n\n\"FAST!\" she cries. \"Papá, we're going SO FAST!\"\n\n\nThe wind whips at your cloak, stings your cheeks, carries away all thoughts of councils and treaties and the weight of crowns. For this moment there is only the horse beneath you, the child in your arms, and the golden light of a December afternoon stretching across the Castilian plain.\n\n\nBehind you, you hear Tormenta's hooves—Lucia giving chase, the black mare's competitive spirit ignited once more. The sound grows closer, and Catalina twists in your arms to look back.\n\n\n\"Lucia-mama is coming!\" she reports breathlessly. \"She's going to catch us!\"\n\n\nAnd then Tormenta is alongside, Lucia bent low over the mare's neck, her dark hair streaming behind her, her face alight with fierce joy. She flashes you a grin—wild, unguarded, nothing of Ferrara's careful courtier in it.\n\n\n\"The King flees!\" she calls out over the thunder of hooves. \"What will the chronicles say?\"\n\n\nCatalina bounces in your arms, torn between loyalties.\n\n\n\"Go faster, Papá!\" she urges. Then, twisting again: \"Go faster, Lucia-mama!\"\n\n\nThe two horses run neck and neck across the stubbled field, grey and black, king and queen, with a princess laughing between them as the sun sinks toward the western hills and the first stars begin to prick the darkening sky.\n\n\n\nEventually, the horses slow—sides heaving, breath steaming in the cooling air. You bring Hidalgo to a walk, and Lucia does the same with Tormenta. The escort, which had scrambled to keep pace, reforms around you at a respectful distance.\n\n\nCatalina slumps against your chest, exhausted and exhilarated.\n\n\n\"That was... so good,\" she murmurs, her voice drowsy. \"Can we do it every day?\""

The transfer is gentle—Catalina's small arms releasing your neck and finding Lucia's, her head settling against the woman's chest as naturally as if she had always belonged there.\n\n\n\"I have you, little one,\" Lucia murmurs, adjusting her hold to secure Catalina safely.\n\n\nCatalina sighs contentedly, her eyes already half-closed.\n\n\n\"Tormenta is warm,\" she observes, her voice fading. \"And Lucia-mama smells nice...\"\n\n\nWithin moments, the rhythm of Tormenta's walk has done what nursery rhymes and rocking chairs sometimes cannot. Catalina's breathing slows, her body goes limp, and she is asleep—held safe in Lucia's arms as the horses walk slowly back toward Toledo.\n\n\nLucia looks down at the sleeping child, then across at you. In the fading light, her grey-green eyes are soft.\n\n\n\"She trusts me,\" she says quietly, wonder in her voice. \"Completely. Without reservation.\"\n\n\nShe shakes her head slowly.\n\n\n\"I have done nothing to earn this, Juan. I have been here mere weeks. And yet she...\"\n\n\nShe trails off, unable to find words for what she is feeling.\n\n\nThe walls of Toledo rise before you, torches already lit along the battlements, the city preparing for night. Somewhere within, Fernando sleeps in his cradle. Somewhere, Álvaro drafts letters and the Military Order Masters negotiate boundaries. Somewhere, the machinery of a kingdom turns.\n\n\nBut here, on this road, there is only the quiet clop of hooves, the weight of a sleeping child, and two people riding home together."

The \"Lucia-mama\" scene was particularly moving."
