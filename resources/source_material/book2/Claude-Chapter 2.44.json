Catalina is asking to see the baby.\n\nThe chapter will pick up exactly where it left off - mid-reunion, with Catalina demanding to see baby Nicolás.\n\nI should write a brief chapter introduction that orients the player to this moment.\n\n\nChapter 2.44\n\n\nJanuary 7th, 1438, Evening\n\n\nThe great hall of the Alcázar glows with the warmth of braziers and candlelight. You have just arrived home after the long journey from Naples—through Sardinia, Majorca, Barcelona, and Zaragoza—finding unusually fair weather for winter. The timing could not have been more fitting: Epiphany evening, the Feast of the Three Kings.\n\n\nYour family surrounds you. Lucia stands radiant despite the obvious weariness of recent childbirth, holding the bundled form of your newborn son in her arms. You have just spoken his name aloud for the first time: Nicolás, for Saint Nicholas of Myra, protector of children and sailors, the Greek meaning \"Victory of the people.\" Six children now. Fernando tugs at your traveling cloak, demanding attention, while little Bianca watches from a nurse's arms with her mother's grey-green eyes. Teresa squirms in the grip of another nurse, and Juana—not yet two—is already reaching toward her mother with an intensity that seems beyond her age.\n\n\nPrincess Catalina, nearly six years old now, stands with her hands on her hips in perfect imitation of a great lady addressing an unsatisfactory steward. Her dark eyes are fixed on the bundle in Lucia's arms.\n\n\n\"I want to see him,\" she announces—not a request, but a royal command. \"Is he suitable?\""

Juan is taking her by the hand to see little Nicolás and asking if she knows about the saints - specifically Saint Nicholas.\n\nLet me write a short scene of this family moment. Catalina is nearly 6, imperious, brilliant (intelligence 87), with a commanding temperament (76), and notably spiritually empty (piety 7). This is an interesting contrast - Juan is asking her about saints, but she's the child with almost no natural piety.\n\nI should keep this relatively short since it's a dialogue/conversation scene. Let Catalina respond and then stop for Juan's next action.\n\n\nYou take Catalina's small hand in yours—still calloused from months of riding and council work—and lead her toward Lucia. The other children shift in their nurses' arms, sensing the moment's importance. Fernando releases your cloak and trails behind, not wanting to be left out.\n\n\nLucia lowers herself carefully to one knee, bringing the bundle closer to Catalina's eye level. The baby's face is red and wrinkled, eyes squeezed shut, a tuft of dark hair visible beneath the swaddling cloth. He makes a small sound—not quite a cry, more a declaration of existence.\n\n\nCatalina studies him with the gravity of a bishop examining a relic.\n\n\n\"He's very small,\" she observes. Then, after a moment's consideration: \"I suppose he'll grow.\"\n\n\nAt your question about the saints, she looks up at you. Her expression shifts—not quite discomfort, but something more like the careful neutrality of a diplomat asked about a subject outside her expertise.\n\n\n\"Father Tomás tells us about them,\" she says. \"Saint Nicholas brings gifts to children on his feast day. And he saved sailors in a storm.\" She recites this as one might recite the principal exports of Flanders—accurate information, correctly filed, emotionally distant. \"There are many saints. They did miracles and died for God.\"\n\n\nShe looks back at the baby.\n\n\n\"Will he do miracles?\"\n\n\nLucia catches your eye above Catalina's head, a flicker of something passing between you.

Behind her, Fernando has crept closer, trying to peer around his sister at the baby. Lucia shifts Nicolás slightly so the candlelight catches his face.\n\n\n\"Mama says it hurts,\" Catalina says matter-of-factly. She glances at Lucia, then back to you. \"She says it hurts very much, but then you forget because you love them.\" A pause. \"I don't understand how you can forget something that hurts. I remember when I fell from the pony. That hurt, and I still remember.\"\n\n\nShe reaches out one finger and touches Nicolás's cheek—gently, with surprising care for a child so often imperious.\n\n\n\"I suppose I will have children,\" she continues, in the tone of someone acknowledging an inevitable administrative duty. \"Queens have children. That's what queens do.\" She withdraws her finger and looks up at you again. \"Will I be a queen, Papa? You have three crowns now. Surely you can spare one.\"\n\n\nLucia's lips twitch—not quite suppressing a smile. Little Fernando, emboldened by Catalina's proximity to the baby, tugs at your hand.\n\n\n\"I want to see!

Juan is lifting Fernando to see the baby and asking Catalina about which crown she might want.\n\nThis is a lovely domestic scene. Let me continue it naturally, with Fernando's reaction to seeing his brother and Catalina's response to the question about crowns.\n\nFernando is about 4.5 years old now (born August 1433, it's January 1438). He's described as brilliant (82), bold (64), with a special talent for languages (76), sincere piety (50), and magnificent physical presence (87). But he has a reluctant martial aptitude (9) - he cannot fight.\n\nCatalina is nearly 6 (born January 1432). She's brilliant (87), commanding (76), with a legendary singing voice, but indifferent piety (7) - spiritually empty. She's beautiful (70).\n\nLet me write Fernando's reaction to seeing his baby brother, then Catalina's response to Juan's question about crowns. I should keep this scene warm and domestic, showing the children's personalities.\n\n\nYou lift Fernando up, and he wraps his arms around your neck for balance, leaning forward to stare at his new brother with the intensity of a scholar examining a newly discovered manuscript. At four and a half, he already has your build—broad-shouldered for his age, with a physical presence that draws the eye. His dark hair falls across his forehead as he peers down.\n\n\n\"He looks like a turnip,\" Fernando announces with evident disappointment. \"A red turnip.\"\n\n\n\"Fernando,\" Lucia says, though her voice carries more amusement than reproach.\n\n\n\"Well, he does.\" Fernando twists to look at you, his face inches from yours. \"Did I look like a turnip when I was born, Papa?\"\n\n\nBefore you can answer, Catalina has seized upon your question with considerably more enthusiasm than she showed for saints.\n\n\n\"Naples,\" she says immediately. Then hesitates, her brow furrowing. \"But Naples speaks... what does Naples speak? Not Castilian. Not the language the Pope uses—\"\n\n\n\"Italian,\" Lucia supplies. \"Though Neapolitan is its own dialect. Rougher than Ferrarese.\"\n\n\n\"Italian,\" Catalina repeats, filing this away. \"And Aragon speaks...?\"\n\n\nShe trails off, looking at you expectantly. This, at least, is a subject that engages her—the concrete mechanics of power, the practical requirements of rule. Not miracles or saints, but crowns and languages and knowing your people.\n\n\nFernando, still in your arms, has lost interest in the conversation and is trying to reach down to poke Nicolás's nose."

Let me check the timeline:\n\n- Catalina was born January 28, 1432\n- The Constantinople expedition was in 1434\n- So Catalina would have been about 2-2.5 years old during that journey\n\nNow it's January 1438, so she's nearly 6 years old. She would have been very young during that trip - about 2 years old. It's unlikely she would have clear memories from that age, though she might have vague impressions or have been told stories about it.\n\nLet me think about how Catalina would respond. She's described as:\n- Genuinely intelligent - learns quickly, remembers details\n- Sunny, affectionate disposition but imperious manner\n- Extraordinary singing voice\n- But spiritually empty (piety roll of 7)\n\nAt nearly 6, being asked about something from when she was 2-2.5, she might have fragmentary memories or conflate what she actually remembers with stories she's been told.\n\nI should have her respond authentically - perhaps some vague impressions, or admitting she doesn't really remember, or mixing up details. This is a good opportunity for characterization.\n\n\nCatalina's expression shifts—the confident administrator giving way to something more uncertain. She is silent for a moment, and you can almost see her reaching back through the years, searching for images that would have been laid down when she was barely more than two years old.\n\n\n\"I remember... water,\" she says slowly. \"So much water. And the ship moving.\" Her hand makes a gentle rocking motion. \"And I was sick. My stomach hurt.\"\n\n\nShe frowns, frustrated by the inadequacy of these fragments.\n\n\n\"There were big walls. Very big. Brown and old.\" Constantinople's land walls, perhaps—or a child's impression of them, magnified by memory. \"And people who talked strangely. Not like us.\"\n\n\nLucia nods gently. \"You were very young, tesoro. Not yet three.\"\n\n\n\"I remember you,\" Catalina says suddenly, looking at Lucia with a flash of clarity. \"You held me when the ship moved too much. You sang to me.\" A pause. \"You smelled like flowers.\"\n\n\nSomething softens in Lucia's face.\n\n\nFernando, still in your arms, has successfully poked Nicolás's cheek, causing the baby to scrunch his face and emit a small, offended sound. Lucia gently intercepts Fernando's hand before he can repeat the experiment.\n\n\n\"I don't remember Naples,\" Catalina admits, returning to the original question. Her tone suggests this is a personal failing she intends to rectify. \"But I can learn it. I can learn Italian and the dialect and the people.\" She straightens. \"When can I go back?\""

This is playful fatherly banter. Catalina is almost six years old - precocious and imperious, but still a child. Let me think about how she would respond to this.\n\nShe's been presented with a challenge - the long journey, sailing. She knows from experience that sailing made her sick. But she's also proud and doesn't like to back down. Her traits show she's commanding (76), brilliant (87), and has that legendary singing voice. But she's also spiritually empty (piety 7).\n\nI should play this as a child who is caught between wanting to appear capable and brave, and the reality that she's still a little girl who got seasick. She might try to bluff, or she might be more honest. Given her intelligence, she probably knows she's being tested or teased.\n\nFernando is still in Juan's arms, and there are the other children around. Lucia is present. Let me write a response that captures the family dynamic and Catalina's character.\n\n\nCatalina's eyes widen—for just a moment, the imperious young queen giving way to a startled child who has been called on a bluff she didn't realize she was making. Fernando giggles in your arms, sensing his sister's discomfort with the unerring instinct of younger siblings everywhere.\n\n\n\"Tomorrow?\" Catalina repeats. She recovers quickly, drawing herself up. \"I am not afraid of sailing, Papa. I simply... found it disagreeable.\"\n\n\n\"She was sick for three days,\" Fernando contributes helpfully. \"Nurse María said she turned green.\"\n\n\n\"I was two,\" Catalina snaps at him. \"I am almost six now. That is entirely different.\"\n\n\nShe turns back to you, and you can see the calculation happening behind her eyes—the same sharp intelligence that lets her learn so quickly now wrestling with pride, practicality, and the dawning suspicion that her father might be teasing her.\n\n\n\"Perhaps,\" she says carefully, \"I should wait until spring. The seas are calmer in spring. That is... strategic. Not fearful. Kings wait for good weather before campaigns. Father Tomás told me about your grandfather, how he—\"\n\n\nShe stops, narrows her eyes at you.\n\n\n\"You're laughing at me, Papa.\"\n\n\nLucia makes a small sound that might be a cough."

He's offering to take her on future ship journeys and asking if she can ride her own horse now.\n\nFrom the character database, I know Catalina is nearly 6 years old (born January 28, 1432, and it's now January 7, 1438). She learned to ride during the Madrid retreat in December 1433 when she was almost 2, and she has \"natural horsemanship instincts.\" She also has a special talent for horsemanship noted for Princess Juana (roll 78), but Catalina herself was noted to have learned riding early.\n\nLet me check - the trait for Catalina shows her special talent is Voice (legendary singing), not horsemanship. The horsemanship talent (roll 78) is actually for Princess Juana, who is not yet 2 years old.\n\nSo Catalina learned to ride young and has natural instincts, but her extraordinary gift is her singing voice. At nearly 6, she should be able to ride a pony or small horse on her own for short distances at least, especially given her fearless nature.\n\nFernando, who is about 4.5 years old, is noted as having a \"reluctant warrior\" martial aptitude (roll 9 - cannot fight), but that doesn't preclude riding. His special talent is languages.\n\nThis is a nice domestic scene. I should have Catalina respond with her characteristic mix of pride and imperiousness, perhaps a bit offended that her father even needs to ask.\n\n\nCatalina's uncertainty vanishes, replaced by genuine indignation.\n\n\n\"Papa, I have been riding my own horse for ages,\" she says, as though you had asked whether she could dress herself or use a spoon. \"Estrella. She is dappled grey with a white star on her forehead. Don Álvaro gave her to me for my fifth nameday.\" A note of pride enters her voice. \"I can canter now. Master Rodrigo says I have an excellent seat.\"\n\n\n\"She does,\" Lucia confirms. \"Better than some of the squires, if the riding master is to be believed.\"\n\n\nCatalina accepts this as her due.\n\n\nFernando squirms in your arms, not to be outdone. \"I can ride too! I have Trueno!\"\n\n\n\"Trueno is a pony,\" Catalina says dismissively. \"And you still need a leading rein.\"\n\n\n\"Do not—\"\n\n\n\"Do too. I saw you yesterday. García was holding the rope the whole time.\"\n\n\nFernando's face flushes, and he turns to you with the wounded dignity of a prince whose honor has been impugned. \"Papa, tell her. I'm a good rider. I'll be better than her soon. I'm going to be a knight.\"\n\n\nThe word hangs in the air for just a moment—knight—and you think of the rolls you know and Fernando does not. The brilliant mind, the magnificent presence, the gift for languages. And the number nine, sitting where martial aptitude should be.\n\n\nLittle Nicolás, as if sensing the sudden weight in the room, begins to fuss in Lucia's arms."

She was in Barcelona when Juan visited in January 1434.\n\nHowever, the user mentions María \"has been staying with us after I visited Barcelona\" - this suggests that María may have come to Toledo to stay with Juan's family. But I need to be careful - the timeline is now January 1438, and the last information I have about María is from earlier chapters.\n\nLet me think about this:\n1. María is Juan's sister\n2. She was regent of Aragon in Alfonso's absence\n3. Alfonso V died at some point (the character database mentions Juan now has three crowns and Alfonso's death is referenced)\n4. If Alfonso is dead, María would no longer be regent\n5.

Based on Chapter 2.42 Summary:\n\n1. Alfonso V died in September 1437\n2. María (Juan's sister, Alfonso's widow) accepted an invitation to come to Toledo\n3. Catalina wrote a letter inviting her Aunt María to Toledo\n4. María would help Juan navigate Aragonese politics\n\nSo María is now a widow, and she's staying with Juan's family in Toledo. This is after Alfonso's death and Juan's inheritance of Aragon. She would be grieving her husband but also supporting her brother.\n\nLet me write a response for María as an NPC. She's Juan's sister, was regent of Aragon in Alfonso's absence, and is now a widow. She should be portrayed with appropriate emotional depth - glad to be with family but also dealing with the loss of her husband.\n\n\nYou turn from the cluster of children toward the edge of the gathering, where a woman in widow's black stands apart from the nurses and courtiers. Queen María of Aragon—your sister, Alfonso's widow these past four months—has been watching the family reunion with an expression that mingles warmth and something more complex. At forty-two, she carries herself with the dignity of a woman who has ruled a kingdom in her husband's name, but the severity of her mourning dress cannot quite conceal the softness around her eyes as she watches her nieces and nephews.\n\n\nShe steps forward when you address her, managing a smile that does not entirely reach those eyes.\n\n\n\"Home,\" she repeats, as if tasting the word. \"It has been... many years since I thought of anywhere as home, brother. Barcelona became mine by necessity. Zaragoza by duty.\" She glances around the great hall of the Alcázar—the Castilian banners, the familiar architecture of their shared childhood. \"This place...

Truly. Alfonso would have wanted...\" She stops, swallows. \"He spoke of you often, toward the end. Of what you built together. He was proud, I think, that you would carry it forward.\"\n\n\nHer hands twist briefly in her black sleeves before she stills them.\n\n\n\"But settling in? I confess I do not know what that means anymore. I was regent for twelve years. Now I am...\" She searches for the word. \"A guest. A widow. An aunt.\" A pause. \"What am I, brother?\""

This is a family scene, so I should keep it warm but also realistic about the challenges of raising six children with very different temperaments and abilities.\n\nLet me think about each child:\n- Catalina (almost 6): Brilliant, commanding, legendary singing voice, spiritually empty (piety 7), beautiful\n- Fernando (4.5): Brilliant, bold, can't fight (martial 9), languages talent, sincere piety, magnificent presence\n- Bianca (3): Fragile health (survival 24), capable intelligence, volatile temperament (7), languages, devout, legendary beauty\n- Teresa (2): Thrives (survival 99), average intelligence (12), spirited, needlework/art talent, devout, pleasant\n- Juana (1): Difficult survival (illness coming at 4-5), sharp, magnetic temperament (99), horsemanship, fervent piety, beautiful\n- Nicolás: Newborn\n\nLucia would know the children well and could give insights into how they're developing socially and educationally. She might mention:\n\n\nCatalina shows remarkable intellectual promise, though her commanding nature can make social interactions challenging. Fernando excels in scholarly pursuits but struggles with physical activities. Bianca requires careful attention due to her delicate health, while Teresa remains the most robust and adaptable. Even at one year old, Juana displays an extraordinary magnetic personality. The companion children are integrating well, creating a dynamic and supportive environment for learning and play.\n\n\nMaría's eyes glisten for just a moment before she masters herself. She reaches out and touches your arm—a gesture she might not have permitted herself even a year ago, when she was still Regent of Aragon and every action carried political weight.\n\n\n\"Just a sister,\" she says quietly. \"I think I had forgotten how to be that.\" She glances at the children, at Catalina now interrogating little Bianca about something, at Fernando still hovering near the baby. \"Very well. I shall practice being an aunt. God knows there are enough of them to practice on.\"\n\n\nShe steps back, and you turn to Lucia.\n\n\nYour wife shifts Nicolás to her other arm—the baby has settled into a drowsy contentment—and considers your question with the thoroughness she brings to all matters of household governance. The journey from Naples, the birth, the weeks of recovery have left faint shadows beneath her grey-green eyes, but her mind remains as sharp as ever.\n\n\n\"The tutors are adequate,\" she says, in a tone that suggests adequate is not entirely a compliment. \"Father Tomás handles Scripture and Latin. The children can recite their prayers correctly, and Catalina's Latin is coming along well—she has an ear for it. Fernando...\" She pauses. \"Fernando devours languages. Father Tomás says he has never seen a child pick up conjugations so quickly. He is already asking about Greek.\"\n\n\nShe glances at Fernando, who has abandoned the baby and is now showing María something—a wooden knight, perhaps, from his pocket.\n\n\n\"But fun? Friends?\" Lucia's expression softens. \"That is where Casa de las Palomas has proven its worth. The companion children—Pedro, Gonzalito, Inés, little Lucía—they play together daily. Catalina...\" A diplomatic pause. \"Catalina organizes them. She decides what games they will play and assigns roles. The others have learned to negotiate with her, which I suppose is a useful skill for future courtiers.\"\n\n\nA small smile crosses her face.\n\n\n\"Teresa is the peacemaker, if you can believe it. Only two years old, and already she toddles between quarreling children and offers them things—toys, bits of bread, whatever she has. She cannot bear discord.\" Lucia shakes her head. \"Bianca is... more difficult. She tires easily and becomes fractious when she cannot keep up. The physicians say her constitution requires extra rest. I have the nurses watch her carefully.\"\n\n\nShe looks down at Juana, who has somehow escaped her nurse and is now clutching Lucia's skirts, staring up at her mother with an intensity that seems beyond her fourteen months.\n\n\n\"And this one.\" Lucia's voice takes on a wondering note. \"She follows people. Not walking well yet, but she crawls after whoever interests her—servants, visitors, her siblings. And when she reaches them, she simply... looks at them. Until they pick her up.\" She strokes Juana's dark hair. \"The nurses say she has never cried to be held. She simply arrives, and somehow you find yourself holding her.\"\n\n\nLucia meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"They are happy, Juan. As happy as royal children can be, with duties and tutors and expectations. But yes—they play. They quarrel. They make up. They are becoming people.\" A pause. \"It is terrifying, honestly.\""

Let me check the chaos-roll skill to see how to construct this properly.\n\n\nView: Reading the chaos-roll skill to construct a d100 table for the children's living arrangements\n\n\nThought process\n\nNow I need to search for information about the Casa de las Palomas and the previous situation with the children's living arrangements, including the camping trip that was mentioned.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Synthesized household trajectory and constructed nuanced chaos table.\n\nGood, I now have the context. The previous roll for the household was a 6 (Disappointing Results), which led to Juan organizing a camping trip to fix things. That camping trip rolled a 51 (Good Success), and by late autumn 1435, the household was described as reformed and children thriving.\n\nNow we're in January 1438 - over two years later. The user wants to see how things have developed since then. I should construct a chaos roll table that reflects:\n\n1. The baseline: The household was working well after the camping trip intervention (Roll 51)\n2. Time passed: Over 2 years of operation\n3. The children have grown and their personalities are now established\n4. New children have been added (Teresa in 1435, Juana in late 1436, Nicolás in late 1437)\n5. The companion children have also grown\n\nFactors that would affect outcomes:\nPOSITIVE:\n- Strong foundation established after camping trip intervention\n- Experienced staff (Doña Beatriz, tutors who improved their methods)\n- Guard arrangements already reformed\n- Children formed genuine bonds\n- Sister Margarita found her calling as storyteller\n- Good outdoor/activity programming established\n- Juan's ongoing attention and care\n\nPOTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS:\n- More children now (6 royal children vs. 4 before)\n- Age spread is wider (6-year-old Catalina down to newborn Nicolás)\n- Different personalities emerging (especially the difficult ones like volatile Bianca, the mysterious Juana)\n- Companion children also growing/changing\n- Staff may have turnover or challenges\n- Maintaining the informal atmosphere becomes harder as children age\n- Bianca's fragile health\n- Catalina's spiritual emptiness may be affecting dynamics\n\nThe table should reflect that a reformed, well-functioning household is likely to continue doing well, but with realistic possibilities for complications or exceptional success.\n\n\nChaos Roll: Casa de las Palomas — Two Years Later\n\n\nIt has been over two years since the camping trip that transformed the household from a gilded cage into something resembling a genuine home. The children have grown, new siblings have arrived, and the companion families have become fixtures of daily life.\n\n\nRelevant Factors:\n\n\nFavorable:\n\n\nStrong foundation established after 1435 intervention (Roll 51)\n\nExperienced, reformed staff under Doña Beatriz\n\nGuard arrangements allow freedom without suffocation\n\nSister Margarita's storytelling ministry\n\nGenuine bonds formed between children of different ranks\n\nOutdoor activities and practical learning integrated into routine\n\nJuan's ongoing personal attention to the household\n\n\nChallenging:\n\n\nSix royal children now (up from four), ages newborn to nearly six\n\nWide age spread creates different needs and dynamics\n\nBianca's fragile constitution requires special accommodation\n\nCatalina's spiritual emptiness—the hollow place where faith should be\n\nCompanion children aging into different roles (Gonzalito now 8, Pedro now 7)\n\nMaintaining informal atmosphere harder as eldest children approach tutoring age\n\nJuana's intense, magnetic personality emerging even at fourteen months\n\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCrisis — Something has gone seriously wrong. A child injured, a trusted staff member dismissed in scandal, or deep rifts have formed between children that threaten the household's foundation.\n6-15\nStruggling — The expanded household has strained the original arrangements. Tutors overwhelmed, companion families feeling displaced by new children, old problems resurfacing. Reform needed again.\n16-30\nAdequate — The household functions, but magic has faded. Children learn their lessons, play when allowed, but the spark of genuine community has dimmed into routine.\n31-50\nStable — The foundation holds. Children are healthy, learning, playing together. Some friction as personalities develop, but nothing beyond normal childhood conflicts.\n51-70\nThriving — The household has matured beautifully. Bonds have deepened, older children help younger ones, companion families fully integrated. A genuine community.\n71-85\nFlourishing — Beyond expectations. The children have formed something remarkable—friendships that transcend rank, mutual care, emerging leadership. Staff report this is unlike any noble household they've served.\n86-95\nExceptional — Casa de las Palomas has become a model. Visiting nobles ask how it works. The children's development—social, intellectual, physical—exceeds all reasonable hopes.\n96-100\nExtraordinary — Something unexpected has emerged.

I should describe what Juan observes and what is reported to him, showing the flourishing state of Casa de las Palomas without being excessive.\n\n\nRoll: 80 — Flourishing\n\n\nLucia's smile deepens as she shifts Nicolás to her shoulder, patting his back gently.\n\n\n\"The children,\" she says, \"are remarkable.

I do not know the word. Not quite teachers, not quite guardians. They organize the younger children. When Teresa fell and scraped her knee last month, it was Pedro who carried her to the nurse, and Catalina who held her hand and told her stories until she stopped crying.

He says I'm almost ready for the big oak.\"\n\n\n\"And Lucía—the seamstress's daughter—she has become something of a court artist,\" Lucia adds with a note of wonder. \"She draws portraits of everyone. The children trade them like treasures. She made one of Bianca sleeping that the nurses framed and hung in the nursery.\"\n\n\nMaría, who has been listening quietly, speaks up. \"I visited last week, while you were still at sea. I have seen many noble households, brother. This is... not like them. The children do not sort themselves by rank. They sort themselves by interest. The climbers climb together. The ones who love stories gather with Sister Margarita. The little ones follow whoever will carry them.\" She pauses. \"Catalina held court in the garden, settling a dispute between Pedro and Gonzalito over whose turn it was with the wooden swords. She listened to both sides, asked questions, and rendered judgment. She was fair, Juan. Not imperious—fair. The boys accepted her ruling without complaint.\"\n\n\nLucia nods. \"The staff say they have never served in a household like this. Two of Doña Beatriz's friends—women who run noble nurseries in Burgos and Valladolid—have written asking if they might visit and observe.\"\n\n\nLittle Juana, still clinging to Lucia's skirts, looks up at you with those dark, intent eyes. Even at fourteen months, there is something in her gaze that seems to see more than it should.\n\n\n\"There is one thing,\" Lucia adds, her voice softening. \"Catalina still does not pray. Not really. She says the words, makes the gestures. Sister Margarita says she is perfect—every response correct, every genuflection precise. But there is nothing behind it. She asked Sister Margarita once why God lets children die, and when Sister Margarita spoke of heaven and mystery, Catalina simply nodded and changed the subject.\" A pause. \"She did not argue. She did not rebel. She simply... filed it away as information that did not concern her.\"\n\n\nLucia meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"Everything else flourishes, Juan.

I need to play this authentically.\n\nCatalina is nearly 6 years old, brilliant (intelligence 87), commanding temperament (76), with an extraordinary singing voice.

Bianca, fragile and fussy from a long day, requires gentle rocking and a lullaby from one of the nurses before her grey-green eyes finally close. Teresa sleeps easily, as she does everything easily—a child who seems to have decided that life requires no particular struggle.

And Nicolás, only weeks old, knows nothing yet but warmth and milk and the steady heartbeat of whoever holds him.\n\n\nCatalina waits.\n\n\nShe has changed into her nightshift, her dark hair brushed and braided by her nurse.

Sister Margarita says we should pray for babies because God listens especially for them.\" A pause. \"Or for the sailors. You said Saint Nicholas protects sailors. There are always sailors who need protecting.\"\n\n\nShe looks at you, and for just an instant, her composure slips—and beneath it you see not rebellion, not doubt, but something more troubling: a child trying very hard to give the right answer to a test she does not understand.\n\n\n\"What do you pray about, Papa?\" she asks. \"When you pray alone, not in the chapel where everyone watches.

You conquered Granada. You went to Constantinople. The Pope calls you Defensor Fidei.\"\n\n\nShe frowns, and for a moment she looks very young—not the imperious little queen, not the brilliant child who organizes other children and renders fair judgments, but simply a girl trying to understand something too large for her.\n\n\n\"If God does not listen to you, Papa... why would He listen to me?\""

The Alcázar is in Toledo, so they'd be going outside the city walls into the countryside.\n\n\nCatalina's eyes widen—not with fear, but with surprise. This is not what she expected. She is accustomed to lessons delivered in chambers, to catechisms recited by firelight, to answers that come wrapped in scripture and theology.\n\n\n\"Outside?\" she asks. \"Now? It is night, Papa.\"\n\n\nBut she is already moving, sliding off the bed, reaching for the dress she wore earlier. A nurse appears in the doorway, alarmed at the activity, but you wave her away. Catalina dresses quickly, her fingers nimble despite the hour, and when you wrap the heavy cloak around her shoulders she pulls it tight, her breath misting in the cold air of the corridor.\n\n\nThe guards at the gate exchange glances when you pass with the princess, but they know better than to question the King. Two move to follow at a distance—you allow this, but gesture for them to remain far back. This is not a moment for armed men hovering at your elbow.\n\n\nThe night is clear and bitter cold, the kind of January night that turns breath to frost and makes the stars burn like scattered diamonds. Toledo sleeps behind you, a dark mass of walls and towers, as you lead Catalina along the path that winds into the hills beyond the city. She does not complain about the cold, does not ask where you are going.

The stars, the cold, the vastness - these are things that humble even a king.

Not the imperious princess who organizes other children, not the brilliant student who files away information like a royal clerk. Just a girl, lying in the dark, trying to understand something too large for her.\n\n\n\"So you do not know either,\" she says. \"Even you.\"\n\n\nIt is not an accusation.

Juan is now inviting her to speak to her dead mother through the stars - not as a theological exercise but as something more personal and emotional.\n\nThis is a pivotal character moment for Catalina. Her piety roll was 7 - spiritually empty. But this doesn't mean she can never connect to faith; it means it doesn't come naturally to her, that she struggles with it. This moment could be the first crack in that emptiness, or it could show how deep it runs.\n\nI need to write Catalina's response authentically.

Ask more questions first\n3. Struggle to find words\n4. Feel something for the first time - or still feel nothing but want to try\n\nI think the most authentic response is somewhere between - she wants to try, she's moved by Juan's words, but she's still uncertain. She might start to speak and find it harder than she expected. This isn't a miraculous conversion moment (that would be too easy given her trait), but it could be the beginning of something - a door cracked open rather than thrown wide.\n\nI should write this as a tender, vulnerable moment. Let her try. Let it be imperfect. Let there be hope without certainty.\n\n\nCatalina looks up at the stars. The tears have stopped, but their tracks still glisten on her cheeks.

I am learning Latin and Greek and how to ride. I have a horse named Estrella.\" Her voice wavers. \"Papa says you loved me. I wish I could remember. I wish...\"\n\n\nShe breaks off. Her hand tightens on yours, gripping hard.\n\n\n\"I do not know if you can hear me,\" she says, and now there is something raw in her voice, something cracking open. \"I do not know if anyone can hear me. But Papa says you might be up there. In the bright places. And if you are...\"\n\n\nShe is crying again. Still silent, still refusing to sob, but the tears come faster now.\n\n\n\"I miss you,\" she whispers. \"I do not remember you, but I miss you. Is that strange?

Juan has just offered a prayer on behalf of Catalina, speaking to God about carrying their thoughts to Isabel. This is a pivotal moment for Catalina's spiritual development - the child who has felt nothing when praying, who sees only stars and not mystery, who cannot feel God's presence.\n\nI need to narrate Catalina's reaction to this prayer. Given her character - brilliant, emotionally guarded, spiritually empty (piety roll of 7) - this moment could go several ways. But this is a genuine breakthrough moment. Her father has shown her a different way to approach prayer - not as rote recitation, but as genuine communication, as speaking to the unknown with hope rather than certainty.\n\nI should show:\n1. Catalina's immediate reaction to the prayer\n2. A small shift - not a complete transformation (that would be unrealistic given her piety roll of 7), but perhaps a crack in the wall, a first glimpse of something she didn't understand before\n3. The intimate father-daughter moment\n4. Perhaps end with something that shows this isn't a complete cure - she still has her doubts - but something has changed\n\nThe scene should be tender, authentic to a nearly-six-year-old, and true to Catalina's character. She's not going to suddenly become devout. But she might understand something she didn't before - that prayer isn't about feeling certain, it's about reaching out despite uncertainty.\n\n\nThe words hang in the cold air, rising like the mist of your breath toward the infinite darkness above. For a moment, there is only silence—the kind of silence that fills cathedrals, that settles over battlefields after the fighting stops, that exists in the spaces between heartbeats.\n\n\nCatalina does not say \"Amen.\"\n\n\nInstead, she turns on her side and buries her face against your chest, her small body shaking. The sobs come now—not silent anymore, but raw and broken, the sound of something that has been held too tightly for too long finally breaking free. She cries like a child, because she is a child, and for once she is not trying to be anything else.\n\n\nYou hold her. The stars wheel overhead, indifferent and eternal, and your daughter weeps against you for a mother she never knew, for questions she cannot answer, for a God she cannot feel.\n\n\nWhen the sobs finally slow, when her breathing steadies, she speaks. Her voice is thick, muffled against your cloak.\n\n\n\"That was different,\" she says. \"When you prayed. It was not like chapel. It was not like Sister Margarita.\" She pulls back just enough to look at you, her face blotched and tear-streaked in the starlight. \"You were not reciting. You were talking.\"\n\n\nShe wipes her nose with the back of her hand—an unladylike gesture that would horrify her nurses.\n\n\n\"I still do not know if anyone heard,\" she admits quietly. \"I still do not feel anything. Not like the priests say you should.\" She looks up at the stars again. \"But... I think I understand now. Why you pray.

In medieval times, children typically made their first confession around age 7 (the \"age of reason\"). So Juan is preparing ahead of time, which makes sense.\n\n2. The user said \"dominican fransiscan\" - I think they mean either Dominican OR Franciscan, as these are two different orders. I should probably ask for clarification or present candidates from both orders.\n\n3.

Sister Margarita is already a Dominican tertiary who teaches religious instruction and has found her calling as a storyteller. But a confessor is different - this would be a priest who can hear confession and provide spiritual guidance.\n\n5. I should narrate the morning mass scene, show the family together, and then have someone (probably Álvaro de Luna or a church official) respond to Juan's request about the confessor candidates.\n\nLet me write this scene.

The family assembles in the royal chapel for the morning Mass—a smaller, more intimate space than the Cathedral, with room enough for the household but not the crowds of courtiers and petitioners.\n\n\nLucia arrives with Nicolás in her arms, the infant swaddled against the chill. María walks beside her, still in her widow's black, her face composed in the serene mask of practiced piety. The nurses bring the younger children: Teresa squirming, Bianca pale and quiet, Juana watching everything with those intent dark eyes. Fernando fidgets in his place, already bored before the Mass has begun.\n\n\nCatalina walks in last, holding the hand of her nurse. She looks tired—there are faint shadows beneath her eyes—but something is different in the way she carries herself. When she takes her place beside you, she glances up and offers a small, private smile. Nothing more. But it is enough.\n\n\nThe Mass proceeds. Father Tomás intones the familiar Latin, the incense rises, the responses come in their proper order. Catalina's lips move with the words, as they always do. But once, during the elevation of the Host, you see her gaze drift upward—past the altar, past the painted ceiling—as if looking for something beyond.\n\n\n\nAfterward, as the family disperses to break their fast, you draw aside Don Álvaro, who has been waiting at the chapel entrance.\n\n\n\"I need candidates,\" you tell him. \"A confessor for Princess Catalina. Dominican or Franciscan—someone young enough to connect with a child, wise enough to guide her, patient enough to answer questions without dismissing them as foolishness.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro raises an eyebrow—just slightly.

This is a significant character moment - we've established that Catalina rolled a 7 for Piety (spiritually empty) at birth, but the user is right that birth traits don't have to be destiny.\n\nLet me think about this carefully using the chaos roll skill.\n\n**What we're rolling for:** Whether Catalina develops genuine faith/spirituality over time, despite her initial low piety roll.\n\n**Success Factors:**\n1. Juan's personal intervention - the stargazing sessions, the genuine conversations about doubt and mystery\n2. Juan modeling authentic prayer (not performance)\n3. Juan validating her doubts (\"I don't know either\")\n4. Juan telling her it's okay not to feel anything yet\n5. The emotional breakthrough - crying, talking to Isabel\n6. Fernando's presence reinforcing the experience\n7. She reported feeling \"something small, like a candle very far away\"\n8. She has been given responsibility (telling siblings when they're ready)\n9. A new confessor is being sought - one who says \"I don't know\"\n10. The household at Casa de las Palomas is flourishing (Roll 80)\n11. Her natural intelligence means she can engage deeply with theology if presented properly\n12. She's only 6 - plenty of time for development\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n1. Initial piety roll of 7 - genuinely spiritually empty at core\n2. Years of performative religion have already created associations\n3. Her analytical mind may always struggle with faith\n4. She explicitly stated she doesn't \"feel\" anything during normal prayer\n5. The experience might fade - emotional moments don't always lead to lasting change\n6. Sister Margarita and Father Tomás may continue their old approaches\n7. Court religion is performative by nature\n8. Her mother's death creates a theological problem she may never resolve\n\n**Historical Context:**\nMedieval children were expected to develop faith through repetition and environment. Personal spiritual experiences were less emphasized than participation in the sacraments. However, mystics and saints often had formative childhood spiritual experiences.\n \nI'll map out potential spiritual trajectories, considering Juan's profound intervention and Catalina's core temperament. The goal is nuanced spiritual growth - not sainthood, but genuine personal faith. Her initial response shows a potential crack in her spiritual wall, suggesting hope for transformation beyond performative religious practice. The challenge lies in moving from intellectual understanding to emotional and spiritual connection.\n\nThe progression ranges from spiritual emptiness to a deeply surprising awakening, with multiple intermediate stages reflecting incremental personal growth. Juan's exceptional intervention creates a meaningful pivot point, potentially counteracting her inherently low spiritual receptivity.\n\n\nChaos Roll: Catalina's Spiritual Awakening\n\n\nThis roll determines the long-term trajectory of Catalina's spiritual development following Juan's intervention. We are not rolling for a single moment, but for whether genuine faith takes root in her soul over the coming years.\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nJuan's authentic modeling — He showed her prayer as conversation, not performance. He admitted his own doubts and unknowing.\n\nValidation of her struggles — Being told \"it is permitted not to feel anything yet\" removed the shame and sense of brokenness.\n\nEmotional breakthrough — She wept for Isabel, spoke to her mother, and felt the words \"going somewhere.\"\n\nFirst glimmer reported — \"Something small. Like a candle very far away. But it was there.\"\n\nResponsibility given — She has been entrusted to guide her siblings to this experience when ready. Purpose often kindles faith.\n\nNew confessor being sought — A Franciscan who can say \"I do not know\" may reach her where others failed.\n\nAge and plasticity — She is not yet six. The soul is still forming.\n\nConnection to Isabel — Faith now has an emotional anchor: her mother in heaven.\n\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nFoundational emptiness (Piety 7) — This is her nature. The hollow place is real, not merely a lack of proper instruction.\n\nAnalytical mind — Her intelligence may always reduce mystery to problems to be solved. Faith requires surrender she may be incapable of.\n\nYears of performative religion — Chapel, catechism, and rote prayer have already created negative associations.\n\nUnresolved theodicy — \"Why did my mother die?\" is a question that breaks many faiths. She may never find peace with it.\n\nEmotional moments fade — A night under the stars is powerful, but the feeling may not survive the return to daily routine and formal religion.\n\nCourt environment — Royal piety is political performance. She will spend her life surrounded by people whose faith is calculation.\n\n\n\nBaseline Assessment:\n\n\nCatalina was born with a spiritual void where faith should be. Juan's intervention was extraordinary—perhaps the best possible approach for a child like her. But changing fundamental nature is difficult. The question is not whether she will become a mystic, but whether she can develop functional, genuine faith rather than remaining hollow.\n\n\n\nd100 Table: Catalina's Spiritual Journey\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nThe Candle Dies — The experience fades. Within months, it becomes a pleasant memory but nothing more. Catalina remains spiritually empty, her faith forever performative. She will say the words, make the gestures, and feel nothing. The hollow place remains.\n11-25\nIntellectual Faith — She develops a scholar's appreciation for theology, Church history, and religious philosophy. She can discuss God brilliantly. But it remains in her head, never reaching her heart. She respects faith without possessing it.\n26-40\nDutiful Observance — She becomes genuinely devout in practice—regular prayer, sincere charity, faithful attendance. But the transcendent experience eludes her. She serves God without feeling His presence. A faithful servant who has never seen her master's face.\n41-55\nQuiet Growth — The seed planted under the stars takes root slowly. Over years, Catalina develops a private, personal faith—not ecstatic, not mystical, but real. She prays and sometimes feels heard. The candle grows to a steady flame, small but persistent.\n56-70\nIsabel's Gift — Her faith becomes anchored in the communion of saints. She may never feel God directly, but she feels her mother—a sense of presence, of being watched over. Through Isabel, she finds her way to genuine belief. An unusual path, but authentic.\n71-85\nThe Wondering Faith — Catalina develops a faith built not on certainty but on holy curiosity. Her questions become prayers. Her doubts become doorways. She becomes one of those rare souls who worship through inquiry, finding God in the asking rather than the answering.\n86-95\nTransformation — Against all expectation, genuine spiritual awakening occurs. The empty place fills. Catalina develops deep, authentic faith that surprises everyone who knew her as a child. She becomes known for her piety—not performed, but radiant.\n96-100\nThe Unexpected Path — Something unforeseen emerges. Perhaps mystical experiences. Perhaps a religious vocation considered. Perhaps she becomes a reformer, a founder, a saint's advocate. Her spiritual journey takes a turn no one predicted, shaping not just her life but the faith of those around her.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed spiritual transformation against immutable character traits.\n\nThe player rolled 18, which falls in the 11-25 range: **Intellectual Faith**.\n\nThis is a bittersweet but realistic outcome. Catalina's fundamental nature (Piety 7 - spiritually empty) proves resistant to change despite Juan's beautiful intervention. She will develop an appreciation for religion as a subject, as philosophy, as history - but it will remain in her head, never reaching her heart.\n\nThis is actually quite fitting for a character with her traits: brilliant intelligence (87), commanding temperament (76), but that foundational emptiness in matters of faith. She can understand religion better than most, discuss it brilliantly, respect it deeply - but she will never truly *feel* it.\n\nJuan's efforts were not wasted - they gave her a better relationship with religion than she might otherwise have had, and they certainly strengthened the bond between father and daughter. But some things cannot be taught or given. The hollow place remains.\n\nI should narrate this outcome with appropriate weight - it's sad, but not tragic. Many people live good lives with intellectual rather than experiential faith. It's just... not what Juan hoped for.\n\n\nRoll: 18 — Intellectual Faith\n\n\n\nThe candle Catalina felt that night—small, distant, flickering—does not die. But neither does it grow into the flame Juan hoped for.\n\n\nIn the months that follow, Catalina embraces what her father taught her. She prays. She speaks to Isabel under the stars when Juan takes her there. She welcomes Brother Hernando when he arrives—a gentle Franciscan with patient eyes who answers her questions honestly and is not afraid to say \"I do not know.\"\n\n\nShe learns. God, she learns.\n\n\nBy age eight, Catalina can discuss the nature of the Trinity with a clarity that startles visiting bishops. By ten, she has read Augustine's Confessions and asks Brother Hernando why the saint's doubts sound so much like her own. By twelve, she debates theodicy with Dominican scholars and holds her own—not with passion, but with precision, dissecting arguments like a surgeon dissecting flesh.\n\n\nShe becomes, in her way, genuinely devout in practice. She attends Mass faithfully. She gives to the poor. She observes the fasts and the feasts. She can recite the lives of the saints with accuracy and genuine appreciation for their sacrifices.\n\n\nBut the transcendent moment never comes.\n\n\nShe waits for it. For years, she waits. She returns to the hillside, sometimes alone, sometimes with siblings she has deemed ready. She teaches Fernando and Teresa and eventually Juana how to speak to the stars, how to reach for Isabel, how to pray with feeling rather than rote recitation.\n\n\nAnd they feel things she does not.\n\n\nShe watches Fernando weep with genuine religious emotion during his first Communion. She sees Teresa's face transform during prayer, touched by something invisible and real. She observes Juana—strange, magnetic Juana—speak of God with the terrifying certainty of one who knows.\n\n\nCatalina feels none of it.\n\n\n\nOne evening, when she is fourteen, she sits with Juan in the solar after vespers. The conversation has turned to faith, as it sometimes does between them.\n\n\n\"I have tried, Papa,\" she says quietly. There is no self-pity in her voice, only calm acceptance. \"For years, I have tried. I have read the mystics. I have fasted. I have prayed until my knees ached. Brother Hernando says I understand the faith better than half the priests in Toledo.\"\n\n\nShe looks at her hands.\n\n\n\"But understanding is not the same as feeling. I can describe fire perfectly—its heat, its light, the way it consumes fuel and produces ash. But I have never been burned by it. I stand before the hearth and feel only... warmth. Pleasant. Distant.\"\n\n\nShe meets your eyes, and in her gaze is something that has taken years to settle: not bitterness, not grief, but a kind of peace.\n\n\n\"I will serve God faithfully, Papa. I will be a good queen, if that is my path. I will raise my children in the Church and teach them what you taught me under the stars. I will defend the faith with my mind, since I cannot defend it with my heart.\"\n\n\nShe takes your hand—the same hand she held on that frozen hillside when she was five years old.\n\n\n\"But I will never feel what you feel. What Fernando feels. What even little Juana feels.\" A pause. \"I have made my peace with it. The hollow place is simply... part of me. Perhaps God made me this way for a reason I cannot understand. Perhaps my faith is meant to be a choice, not a feeling. A discipline, not a gift.\"\n\n\nShe smiles—small, wry, entirely her own.\n\n\n\"Brother Hernando says there is a term for people like me. Fides quaerens intellectum. Faith seeking understanding. He says some of the greatest theologians were men who thought their way to God because they could not feel their way.\"\n\n\nShe squeezes your hand.\n\n\n\"Thank you for trying, Papa. That night under the stars—I have never forgotten it. I never will. It did not give me what you hoped. But it gave me something else.\"\n\n\n\"What?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"You,\" she says simply. \"It gave me you. And that is enough.\""

This is interesting because Fernando's trait roll was a 9 for martial aptitude - \"reluctant, cannot fight.\" This is a fundamental character trait that will be very difficult to overcome.\n\nLet me think about this situation:\n- Fernando is 4.5 years old (born August 1433, it's now January 1438)\n- He has brilliant intelligence (82), bold temperament (64), gift for languages (76), sincere piety (50), and magnificent physical presence (87)\n- But his martial aptitude is 9 - essentially the lowest possible\n- He wants to be a knight, talks about being a knight, but the roll suggests he fundamentally cannot fight\n\nThis is a delicate situation. Juan wants to see if he can awaken martial interest, but the rolls have established Fernando's nature. The GM shouldn't make it easy - Fernando's reluctance to fight is baked into his character.\n\nLet me write a scene of Juan watching Fernando play at being a knight. I should show:\n1. Fernando's enthusiasm for the IDEA of knighthood\n2. Signs of his actual limitations\n3. Perhaps contrast with other children like Pedro or Gonzalito who have more natural aptitude\n4.

Juan is watching to see what Fernando is like naturally.\n\n\nThe days following Epiphany settle into a rhythm. The court adjusts to Juan's return, petitions accumulate, and the machinery of three kingdoms demands attention. But you find time one grey afternoon to slip away from councils and correspondence, making your way to the courtyard where the children play.\n\n\nYou find them near the old well, in the sheltered corner where the walls block the worst of the January wind. Fernando has gathered an audience: Catalina watches from a stone bench with Bianca beside her, wrapped in furs. Pedro and Gonzalito stand nearby, wooden swords in hand. Little Teresa toddles about collecting pebbles, supervised by a nurse.\n\n\nFernando stands in the center, wearing a pot helm far too large for his head—likely borrowed from the guardhouse—and wielding a wooden sword with tremendous enthusiasm. He has draped a blanket over his shoulders as a cloak.\n\n\n\"I am the King of Jerusalem!\" he announces, his voice muffled by the helm. \"And you are the Saracens! Prepare to be vanquished!\"\n\n\nHe charges at Pedro, swinging wildly. Pedro—a year older and the son of a soldier—sidesteps easily and gives Fernando a gentle tap on the shoulder.\n\n\n\"You're dead, Your Highness,\" Pedro says, grinning.\n\n\n\"I am NOT dead!\" Fernando protests, spinning around. \"Kings cannot die! I have— I have holy protection!\"\n\n\nHe swings again. This time Gonzalito joins in, and within moments Fernando is flailing between them, his sword meeting only air while their wooden blades tap his arms, his legs, his back. He grows increasingly frustrated, his swings becoming wider, clumsier.\n\n\n\"That is not FAIR!\" he shouts, throwing down his sword. \"You are supposed to fight me ONE AT A TIME!\""

This is a good opportunity to observe Fernando's natural inclinations - his lack of martial aptitude (roll of 9) versus his other gifts (intelligence 82, languages 76, magnificent presence 87). I should narrate the play session and let the dynamics between the children emerge naturally.\n\nLet me think about what would realistically happen:\n- Fernando (4.5 years old) - brilliant, bold temperament, but reluctant warrior (martial aptitude 9). He has magnificent physical presence but doesn't have the instinct for fighting.\n- Bianca (3 years old) - fragile health (survival 24), volatile temperament (7), but legendary beauty (98). Her sudden fierceness is interesting - volatile temperament could mean intense emotional swings.\n- Pedro (7) - martial, son of a soldier, wants to be a knight\n- Gonzalito (8) - natural climber, reliable\n\nThe play should show Fernando's natural tendencies - perhaps he's more interested in the strategy, the talking, the negotiating, rather than the actual fighting. His gifts are elsewhere.\n\nI'll narrate a scene where the children play, and the dynamics reveal character. Fernando might try to negotiate rather than fight, or find ways to \"win\" that don't involve direct combat. Bianca's volatility might show - she burns hot but then tires quickly (fragile constitution).\n\n\nThe siege of the firewood cart unfolds with all the drama and chaos of childhood warfare.\n\n\nPedro leads the first assault, charging with his wooden sword raised. Fernando moves to meet him—but Bianca is faster, lunging forward with her stick and shrieking like a small, furious falcon. The sound is so startling that Pedro stumbles, and Bianca jabs him in the chest.\n\n\n\"You are DEAD!\" she screams. \"DEAD DEAD DEAD!\"\n\n\n\"I am not—\" Pedro starts, but Bianca is already turning on Gonzalito, who has attempted to flank the cart. She swings wildly, her small body trembling with exertion.\n\n\nFernando, meanwhile, has not moved from his position. He watches his sister's assault with something between admiration and bewilderment. When Gonzalito dodges Bianca and comes at him directly, Fernando raises his sword—but instead of swinging, he speaks.\n\n\n\"Wait!\" he calls out. \"I offer you terms! If you surrender now, I will make you a duke!\"\n\n\nGonzalito pauses, confused. \"A duke?\"\n\n\n\"A duke of... of somewhere. A good place. With horses.\"\n\n\n\"Fernando, you are supposed to FIGHT him,\" Catalina calls from her bench, half-exasperated, half-amused.\n\n\n\"Kings do not always fight,\" Fernando replies with surprising dignity. \"Sometimes they make treaties. Papa makes treaties.\"\n\n\nBianca, however, has no interest in diplomacy. She launches herself at Gonzalito with renewed fury—but the effort is too much. Halfway through her charge, she stumbles, her face suddenly pale. She sits down hard on the cart, breathing heavily.\n\n\n\"I am tired,\" she announces, and promptly lies down on the wooden slats, closing her eyes.\n\n\nThe siege pauses. Everyone looks at Bianca with concern.\n\n\nFernando kneels beside her, his sword forgotten. \"Bianca? Are you well?\" He touches her forehead gently, then looks up at you, worry creasing his young face. \"Papa, she is cold.\""

This is who he is.\n\nI should have Fernando explain his reasoning in a way that reveals his character - his intelligence, his preference for words over swords, his understanding of how power actually works.

Still, he should sound like a very bright young child, not an adult.\n\n\nFernando walks beside you through the corridors, his wooden sword still clutched in one hand.

Or did you make them want to give them to you?\"\n\n\nHe stumbles slightly on an uneven flagstone, catches himself, and continues without missing a beat.\n\n\n\"Father Tomás says King Solomon was the wisest king because he did not fight wars. He made everyone want to be his friend instead. And he built a great temple.\" Fernando looks up at you earnestly. \"I would rather build a temple than fight a war. Wars hurt people. Temples make people happy.\"\n\n\nHe pauses at the entrance to the family's chambers, his small face serious.\n\n\n\"Is that wrong, Papa? To not want to fight?\""

He's four and a half years old, so his answer should be childlike but also reveal something deeper about his character. He's not a coward - his temperament is bold. But something about violence itself doesn't sit right with him.\n\nI should have Fernando answer honestly, in a child's way, revealing that fundamental aspect of his nature - that he simply doesn't have the martial instinct, perhaps even finds violence distressing in some way. This should feel authentic to a child who is brilliant and thoughtful but simply lacks the warrior's heart.\n\n\nFernando is quiet for a long moment. He pulls off the oversized helm and holds it in his hands, turning it over, studying the crude iron as if it holds answers.\n\n\n\"When I hit Pedro with the sword,\" he says slowly, \"even though it is wood, even though it is play...

I do not think I am afraid.\" His brow furrows. \"When Bianca charged at Pedro, I wanted to protect her. I wanted to. But my arms would not... they would not go.

Juan's reframing - fighting as protection, not violence\n2. The game setup - defending sisters gives emotional stakes\n3. Fernando's natural empathy - he doesn't want to hurt people\n4. His love for his siblings - especially after the stargazing bonding\n5. The conversation about David and Goliath - finding different weapons\n6.

His bold temperament (64) - he's not a coward, just reluctant to harm\n\nFailure factors (Fernando remains disconnected from martial/protective duties):\n1. His fundamental martial reluctance (aptitude 9) - this is deep-seated\n2. He still prefers negotiation to confrontation\n3. Physical hesitation when conflict arises\n4. He may intellectualize rather than act\n5. The gap between understanding and doing\n\nThis is a formative moment, but one game won't transform him entirely.

This aligns with Fernando's empathetic nature.\n\nEmotional stakes — Defending his sisters is different from abstract combat. Bianca and Juana are real to him.\n\nRole models present — Pedro demonstrates duty and protection naturally, providing an example Fernando can observe.\n\nRecent bonding — The night under the stars has strengthened Fernando's sense of family connection.\n\nIntelligent child — Fernando (Intelligence 82) can grasp abstract concepts and apply them.\n\nBold temperament (64) — He is not a coward; his reluctance is about harming, not about fear.\n\nCreative game structure — Rotating roles lets Fernando experience both sides and find his place.\n\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nDeep-seated reluctance (Martial 9) — His instinct to stop before striking is fundamental, not easily overcome.\n\nPreference for negotiation — He may still try to talk his way out rather than act.\n\nPhysical hesitation — Understanding protection intellectually is different from doing it in the moment.\n\nYoung age — He is not yet five. Instincts are forming but malleable in unpredictable ways.\n\n\n\nd100 Table: The Game of Protection\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nWithdrawal — Fernando cannot bring himself to participate meaningfully. He hangs back, offers truces, or finds excuses to leave. The game reinforces his disconnect from physical defense.\n11-25\nConfusion — Fernando tries but remains uncertain. He defends hesitantly when it is his turn, attacks reluctantly when required. No clear instinct emerges. The game is just a game.\n26-40\nIntellectual Understanding — Fernando grasps the concept but cannot translate it to action. He explains afterwards why protection matters, but in the moment, he still freezes. Head and body remain separated.\n41-55\nA Glimmer — Something small shifts. In one moment—perhaps when Bianca is \"threatened\"—Fernando acts without thinking. It surprises everyone, including himself. A seed planted, though fragile.\n56-70\nThe Protector Awakens — When defending his sisters, Fernando finds something he lacked in pure combat: purpose. He still cannot attack, but he can stand between. A meaningful distinction emerges.\n71-85\nUnexpected Discovery — Fernando discovers his own way to protect. Perhaps he organizes the defense, directs Pedro, or finds creative solutions. Leadership rather than swordsmanship. His gifts find application.\n86-95\nTransformation — The game unlocks something. Fernando defends Bianca with a ferocity that shocks everyone—not violent, but resolute. He will never be a warrior, but he has found his courage.\n96-100\nThe Shield Prince — Something extraordinary emerges. Fernando's protective instinct proves deeper than anyone knew. He becomes the children's natural guardian—not through strength, but through unwavering presence. A new identity begins to form.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

Fernando discovers his own way to protect - perhaps organizing the defense, directing Pedro, or finding creative solutions. Leadership rather than swordsmanship. His gifts find application.\n\nLet me write this out as a narrative scene showing how the game unfolds and how Fernando finds his own unique approach to protection.\n\n\nRoll: 79 — Unexpected Discovery\n\n\n\nThe game begins simply enough. Gonzalito charges first, whooping like a Moorish raider, wooden sword raised high. Pedro meets him solidly, blocking, parrying, driving him back with the economical movements his father taught him. Bianca watches with queenly disdain, her hands still folded in her lap. Juana has finally stopped trying to eat her crown and is staring at the combat with unsettling intensity.\n\n\nFernando hangs back, sword in hand, watching.\n\n\n\"Fernando! Help me!\" Gonzalito calls, circling around to flank Pedro. \"Attack from the other side!\"\n\n\nFernando moves—but slowly, uncertainly. By the time he reaches striking distance, Pedro has already driven Gonzalito back again. Fernando's sword rises, hesitates, and Pedro knocks it aside almost as an afterthought.\n\n\n\"You must be faster, Your Highness,\" Pedro says, not unkindly.\n\n\nThey reset. Gonzalito attacks again. Fernando tries again. The same result.\n\n\nThen you rotate the roles. Gonzalito defends. Pedro attacks. Fernando is told to help Pedro assault the princesses.\n\n\nHe cannot do it.\n\n\nHe stands there, wooden sword at his side, watching Pedro batter at Gonzalito's defenses, and his feet will not move toward his sisters. Bianca catches his eye and—playing her role perfectly—gives him a look of such regal disappointment that Fernando flushes red.\n\n\n\"Fernando,\" Catalina calls from her bench, \"you are supposed to be the villain.\"\n\n\n\"I know,\" he says miserably. \"I know.\"\n\n\n\nThe third rotation changes everything.\n\n\nThis time Fernando defends. Pedro and Gonzalito circle him like wolves, coordinating their attacks with the easy partnership of boys who have played at war for years. Fernando raises his sword, his face pale, his stance all wrong.\n\n\nPedro feints left. Gonzalito darts right.\n\n\nFernando does not try to fight them both.\n\n\nInstead, he moves—not toward the attackers, but toward Bianca and Juana, placing his body directly between his sisters and the assault. His sword comes up, but not to strike. To block. To buy time.\n\n\n\"Pedro!\" he shouts. \"The treasury! Gonzalito is going for the treasury!\"\n\n\nIt is a lie. Gonzalito is nowhere near the treasure chest. But Pedro's head turns instinctively at the warning, and in that moment of confusion, Fernando grabs Bianca's arm.\n\n\n\"Move behind the cart! Now! Juana too!\"\n\n\nBianca, startled out of her princess pose, scrambles to obey. The nurse scoops up Juana. Fernando backs toward them, keeping his sword raised—not attacking, just present. A barrier.\n\n\n\"That is not fair!\" Gonzalito protests. \"You cannot just move them!\"\n\n\n\"Why not?\" Fernando asks, genuinely puzzled. \"You are trying to capture them. I am trying to keep them safe. I am keeping them safe.\"\n\n\nPedro lowers his sword, frowning. \"But the fight—\"\n\n\n\"The fight is not the point,\" Fernando says. And there is something in his voice now—a certainty that was not there before. \"The princesses are the point. If they are safe, I win. Even if you beat me with swords, if they escape, I win.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you, seeking confirmation.\n\n\nGonzalito throws up his hands. \"He is making up rules!\"\n\n\nBut Pedro is quiet, thinking. The son of a soldier recognizes something.\n\n\n\"No,\" Pedro says slowly. \"He is right. My father says the same thing. The objective is what matters. Killing enemies means nothing if you lose what you were protecting.\"\n\n\n\nThe game continues, and Fernando transforms it.\n\n\nHe stops trying to fight and starts commanding. When he defends, he positions Pedro as his sword arm and directs Gonzalito to guard the flanks. He creates signals—a whistle for danger, a hand gesture for \"move the princesses.\" He sacrifices himself willingly, letting attackers \"kill\" him while his allies spirit Bianca and Juana to safety.\n\n\n\"The king is dead, but the princesses live!\" he announces cheerfully after one such sacrifice. \"That is a victory!\"\n\n\nWhen he attacks, he does not charge. He sends Pedro in first, then coordinates with Gonzalito to create distractions. He talks constantly—identifying weaknesses, calling out positions, adjusting tactics on the fly.\n\n\n\"Gonzalito, go left—no, your other left—Pedro, watch his sword arm, he always drops it before he swings—\"\n\n\nBy the end of the afternoon, the game has evolved into something none of the children have played before. Fernando never lands a blow. He never needs to. He is everywhere and nowhere, the voice that organizes, the mind that plans, the presence that holds the defense together.\n\n\nCatalina watches from her bench, her expression unreadable.\n\n\nBianca, exhausted but exhilarated, tugs at your sleeve.\n\n\n\"Papa,\" she whispers, \"Fernando is good at this. But he is not fighting at all.\"\n\n\n\nThat evening, Fernando finds you before dinner. His face is flushed with the day's exertion, but his eyes are bright—not with battle-fever, but with the glow of discovery.\n\n\n\"Papa,\" he says, \"I think I understand now. About protecting.\"\n\n\nHe sits beside you, still catching his breath.\n\n\n\"I cannot swing a sword like Pedro. I never will. But Pedro listens to me. Gonzalito too. When I see where the danger is and tell them, they can stop it. And when I move Bianca before the danger reaches her, she never needs saving at all.\" He looks up at you. \"Is that... is that a kind of fighting too?\""

Fernando stands slightly apart, his breath misting in the cold air, watching.\n\n\n\"The rules are simple,\" you announce. \"Two teams. Get the ball to your end of the courtyard. You may carry it, throw it, kick it. You may not strike with fists or feet—but you may grab, push, and tackle to take the ball.\"\n\n\nFernando's eyes widen slightly at the word tackle.\n\n\nCatalina has joined today, wrapped in a warm cloak. \"I will keep score,\" she announces, settling onto her usual bench. Teresa sits beside her, and Bianca—still tired from yesterday—watches from a nurse's arms.\n\n\nYou divide the teams: Pedro and Fernando against Gonzalito and yourself. This puts Fernando with the strongest fighter, and against his father—someone he will not be afraid to challenge.\n\n\n\"Ready?\" you ask.\n\n\nPedro crouches, eager. Gonzalito bounces on his toes. Fernando stands very still, his jaw set with determination that does not quite hide his uncertainty.\n\n\nYou drop the ball in the center of the courtyard."

Safe environment - Fernando is playing with his father, who will hold back\n2. Team dynamic - Pedro is on his team, providing support and modeling\n3. Yesterday's success - Fernando discovered his leadership abilities, giving him confidence\n4. Game structure - This isn't combat, it's a ball game with different rules\n5. Bold temperament (64) - He's not a coward, just reluctant to harm\n6. Intelligence (82) - He can understand the purpose of the exercise\n7. Physical presence (87) - He has a magnificent physical frame, he's not weak\n8. Father's encouragement - Juan is actively trying to draw him out\n\nFailure Factors:\n1. Martial aptitude (9) - Deep reluctance to physical confrontation\n2. Young age - Not yet five, physical contact can be scary\n3. Previous patterns - He's used to hanging back\n4. Fear of failure - He knows he's not good at physical things compared to Pedro\n\nThe outcomes should range from:\n- Complete withdrawal/fear\n- Hesitant participation\n- Gradual engagement\n- Finding his own way to participate\n- Genuine breakthrough in physical confidence\n\nLet me draft the table:\n\n\nChaos Roll: Fernando and Physical Play\n\n\nThis roll determines whether Fernando can overcome his hesitance toward physical contact—not to become a warrior, but to develop the basic confidence that a king needs when standing among soldiers, negotiating from strength, or simply refusing to be intimidated.\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nSafe environment — This is play, not combat. His father is present and holding back.\n\nTeam structure — Pedro is his ally, not his opponent. Fernando can lean on his strength.\n\nYesterday's breakthrough — He discovered he can contribute through leadership. Confidence carries forward.\n\nPhysical inheritance — Fernando has magnificent physical presence (87). His body is capable; only his mind holds him back.\n\nBold temperament (64) — He is not a coward. His reluctance is specific to harming others, not to all physical contact.\n\nDifferent context — A ball game is not sword fighting. There is no pretense of violence, only competition.\n\nFather's participation — Being tackled by Papa is different from being tackled by peers. It normalizes contact.\n\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nDeep-seated reluctance (Martial 9) — Physical confrontation of any kind may trigger the same freeze response.\n\nYoung age — He is not yet five. Being knocked down can be frightening regardless of context.\n\nComparison to peers — Pedro and Gonzalito are naturally physical. Fernando may feel inadequate and withdraw.\n\nOverthinking — His brilliant mind may analyze rather than act, keeping him hesitant.\n\n\n\nd100 Table: The Ball Game\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nWithdrawal — Fernando cannot engage. Every time contact approaches, he flinches away or passes the ball before anyone can reach him. He ends the game frustrated and ashamed, more convinced than ever that physical endeavors are not for him.\n11-20\nOverwhelmed — Fernando tries, but the first hard contact—a tackle from you or a collision with Gonzalito—sends him to the ground in tears. Not injured, but shaken. The game ends early. A setback that will need gentle recovery.\n21-35\nTentative Participation — Fernando plays but avoids contact whenever possible. He passes quickly, hangs back, lets Pedro do the physical work. He is present but not truly engaged. No progress, but no harm done.\n36-50\nGradual Warming — Fernando starts hesitant but slowly engages more as the game continues. By the end, he has absorbed a few bumps without complaint, though he still avoids initiating contact. A small step forward.\n51-65\nFinding His Role — Fernando discovers he can contribute without being the battering ram. He positions himself cleverly, receives passes, uses his size to shield the ball. He takes contact when necessary and does not crumble. Quiet competence emerges.\n66-80\nUnexpected Grit — Something clicks. Fernando takes a tackle—perhaps from you—goes down hard, and gets back up with determination rather than tears. He begins to seek the ball rather than avoid it. A genuine shift in confidence.\n81-90\nThe Prince Stands Firm — Fernando surprises everyone, including himself. He does not become aggressive, but he becomes solid. When Gonzalito tries to push past him, Fernando plants his feet and holds. When you tackle him, he laughs and demands the ball back. Physical contact loses its power to intimidate.\n91-95\nJoyful Discovery — Fernando finds genuine pleasure in the physical play. Not in dominance or victory, but in the simple exhilaration of bodies in motion, of striving and struggling. He will never love combat, but he has learned to love competition.\n96-100\nThe Magnificent Presence Awakens — Fernando's physical gifts (87) begin to manifest. He is only four, but there are moments in the game when his frame, his stance, his sheer presence give even the older boys pause. A glimpse of the man he might become—not a warrior, but someone no one would dare to dismiss.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

This is an excellent outcome - Fernando finds genuine pleasure in physical play, not in dominance or victory, but in the simple exhilaration of bodies in motion, of striving and struggling. He will never love combat, but he has learned to love competition.\n\nLet me write a vivid narrative of how this unfolds during the ball game.\n\n\nRoll: 93 — Joyful Discovery\n\n\n\nThe ball hits the frozen ground and bounces once. Pedro is fastest—he scoops it up and tucks it under his arm, already scanning for Fernando. Gonzalito charges at him. You hang back, watching, letting the boys establish the rhythm of the game.\n\n\nPedro dodges Gonzalito's first grab and throws the ball to Fernando.\n\n\nFernando catches it. For a moment, he freezes—you can see the old hesitation, the instinct to pass it away before anyone reaches him. Gonzalito is already running toward him, arms outstretched.\n\n\nThen something shifts.\n\n\nFernando does not throw the ball. He runs.\n\n\nIt is clumsy at first—he holds the ball wrong, his legs pump awkwardly, and Gonzalito is faster. But Fernando does not stop. When Gonzalito reaches him, Fernando tries to spin away, fails, and goes down in a tangle of limbs and wool and cold earth.\n\n\nGonzalito emerges with the ball, triumphant.\n\n\nFernando lies on his back, staring at the winter sky. For a heartbeat, you think he might cry.\n\n\nThen he laughs.\n\n\nIt is a sound you have rarely heard from him—not the polite chuckle of a prince acknowledging a jest, but a genuine, breathless, delighted laugh. He rolls onto his stomach, pushes himself up, and chases after Gonzalito with a grin splitting his face.\n\n\n\"Give it back!\" he shouts, and there is joy in his voice.\n\n\n\nThe game transforms.\n\n\nFernando still cannot match Pedro's speed or Gonzalito's scrappy determination. But he stops caring. He throws himself into collisions he cannot win. He falls, rolls, rises, falls again. His fine clothes are smeared with mud and frost. His hair is wild. His cheeks are red with cold and exertion.\n\n\nYou tackle him once—gently, but firmly, bringing him down with your arms around his waist. He hits the ground with a grunt, the ball squirting free, and when you release him, he is already scrambling after it.\n\n\n\"Too slow, Papa!\" he calls over his shoulder.\n\n\nPedro stares at his prince with something like wonder.\n\n\n\"He is different today,\" Gonzalito mutters, half-admiring, half-annoyed, as Fernando intercepts a pass meant for you and charges toward the far end of the courtyard.\n\n\nHe does not score. Gonzalito catches him from behind, and they tumble together in a heap. But Fernando emerges laughing again, slapping Gonzalito on the back.\n\n\n\"Good tackle! You are fast!\"\n\n\n\nThe game continues until the children are exhausted, until breath comes in ragged gasps and legs tremble with effort. The score is forgotten—if anyone was keeping it. What matters is the mud on Fernando's face, the brightness in his eyes, the way he keeps asking \"Again? One more?\"\n\n\nWhen you finally call an end, Fernando collapses onto the cold ground, chest heaving, staring up at the pale winter sun.\n\n\n\"Papa,\" he says between breaths, \"that was wonderful.\"\n\n\nPedro sits beside him, equally winded. \"You did well, Your Highness. You held onto the ball longer than I thought you would.\"\n\n\n\"I fell down a lot,\" Fernando says.\n\n\n\"Everyone falls down,\" Pedro replies. \"My father says the measure of a soldier is not how often he falls, but how fast he gets up.\"\n\n\nFernando considers this. \"I got up fast.\"\n\n\n\"You did.\"\n\n\n\nThat evening, Fernando finds you again. He has been bathed and changed, but there is still a smudge of dirt behind his ear that the servants missed. His body must ache from the unaccustomed exertion, but he moves with a new ease—a looseness in his shoulders that was not there before.\n\n\n\"Papa,\" he says, settling beside you by the fire, \"I think I understand something new.\"\n\n\nHe stares into the flames, searching for words.\n\n\n\"When Gonzalito tackled me the first time, I thought it would be terrible. I thought I would hate it. But then I was on the ground, and I was not hurt, and I thought... is that all?\" He looks at you. \"And then it was not frightening anymore. It was just... part of the game. Like falling off Trueno when I am learning to ride. It happens, and then you get up.\"\n\n\nHe pulls his knees to his chest, wrapping his arms around them.\n\n\n\"I still do not want to hurt people, Papa. When Pedro and Gonzalito hit each other with swords, even wooden ones, I see them wince. I do not want to make anyone wince.\" He pauses. \"But being hit... that is different. That is just me. And I can decide not to be afraid of it.\"\n\n\nHe looks up at you, and there is something new in his eyes—not the hunger for battle that marks born warriors, but a quiet confidence. The knowledge that his body can take what the world gives and keep moving.\n\n\n\"Can we play again tomorrow?\""

The idea clearly had not occurred to him—that he, a prince, might simply invite common boys to play.\n\n\n\"Boys from the city?\" he repeats slowly. \"Like... anyone?\"\n\n\nHe is quiet for a moment, processing this the way he processes everything—turning it over, examining it from multiple angles.\n\n\n\"At Casa de las Palomas, we play with Pedro and Gonzalito and Lucía and Inés,\" he says. \"And they are not princes or princesses.

This is about social integration, breaking down barriers between prince and commoner, and Fernando's development as a future king who understands his people.\n\nLet me think about the factors:\n\nSuccess Factors:\n1. Fernando's natural empathy and reluctance to harm - makes him approachable\n2. His intelligence (82) - can navigate social situations\n3. His bold temperament (64) - willing to try\n4. Recent breakthroughs - confidence from ball game, leadership discovery\n5. Gift for languages (76) - communication skills extend beyond just foreign tongues\n6. Physical presence (87) - commands respect without trying\n7. Juan's encouragement - has royal permission and support\n8. Casa de las Palomas experience - already learned to bond across rank with Pedro, Gonzalito, etc.\n9. Joyful discovery from ball game - genuinely enjoys physical play now\n\nFailure Factors:\n1. Young age (not yet 5) - social navigation is hard\n2. Class barriers - 15th century Castile has rigid social hierarchies\n3. Other children's fear/awe - they may not be able to see past the crown\n4. Court interference - nobles or servants may prevent genuine interaction\n5. Fernando's own uncertainty - still learning who he is\n6. Potential for mockery or rejection - city boys may resent a prince \"playing\" at being common\n7. Safety concerns - guards hovering could ruin the atmosphere\n\nLet me draft a table that covers the range of outcomes from disaster to extraordinary success.\n\n\nChaos Roll: Fernando and the City Boys\n\n\nThis roll determines how Fernando's attempt to befriend common children develops over time—not a single afternoon, but the pattern that emerges over weeks and months of play.\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nRecent breakthroughs — Fernando has discovered joy in physical play and confidence in his own body. He approaches this with momentum.\n\nNatural empathy — His reluctance to harm others translates to genuine kindness. He does not look down on those of lower station.\n\nIntelligence (82) — He can read social situations and adapt his behavior to put others at ease.\n\nGift for languages (76) — Communication is his strength. He knows how to talk to people.\n\nPhysical presence (87) — Even young, there is something about Fernando that commands attention without intimidation.\n\nCasa de las Palomas experience — He has already learned to bond across rank with Pedro, Gonzalito, Lucía, and Inés.\n\nBold temperament (64) — He is willing to try, to risk awkwardness, to push through discomfort.\n\nRoyal support — Juan has explicitly encouraged this. Guards and servants will not interfere.\n\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nClass barriers — 15th century Castile has rigid social hierarchies. Common boys may be too frightened or awed to play naturally.\n\nYoung age — Fernando is not yet five. Social navigation across class lines is difficult for any child.\n\nCourt interference — Despite Juan's support, nobles or servants may subtly discourage \"inappropriate\" mingling.\n\nResentment — Some common boys may resent a prince \"playing\" at being ordinary. They live lives he cannot understand.\n\nFernando's own uncertainty — He asked the right questions, but asking and doing are different things.\n\nSafety concerns — Guards must be present, however discreetly. Their presence may poison the atmosphere.\n\nJealousy among existing companions — Pedro and Gonzalito have worked hard for Fernando's friendship. New boys may create tension.\n\n\n\nd100 Table: The Prince and the City Boys\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDisaster — The experiment fails badly. Common boys either flee in terror, mock the prince behind his back, or are so stiff and formal that no connection forms. Fernando is hurt and withdraws. The attempt is not repeated, and he learns to keep his distance from those outside his station.\n6-15\nRejection — The city boys come, but they do not warm to Fernando. They see only the crown, the guards, the gulf between their worlds. The games are awkward, forced. Fernando tries his best but cannot bridge the gap. He concludes, sadly, that perhaps some walls cannot be crossed.\n16-25\nSuperficial Contact — Some boys come and play, but the relationships remain shallow. They are polite, careful, never quite real. Fernando gains acquaintances but not friends. He learns that wearing a crown means some doors close even as others open.\n26-40\nMixed Results — A few boys warm to Fernando; others remain distant. The games are sometimes joyful, sometimes awkward. Fernando learns that people are individuals—some can see past rank, others cannot. A useful lesson, if bittersweet.\n41-55\nGradual Acceptance — It takes time—weeks, perhaps months—but slowly the barriers thin. The city boys stop bowing every time Fernando speaks. Laughter becomes genuine. Real friendships begin to form, fragile but authentic.\n56-70\nThe Prince's Touch — Fernando's natural gifts shine through. His kindness, his curiosity, his willingness to fall down and get back up—these qualities win hearts. The city boys come to see Fernando, not just the prince. Word spreads that the heir of Castile is \"not like other nobles.\"\n71-85\nBeloved Among the Common — Fernando becomes genuinely popular with the city children. They seek him out, not from obligation but desire. He learns their names, their families, their dreams. They teach him things no tutor could—the rhythms of common life, the concerns of ordinary people. A prince who understands his people begins to form.\n86-95\nThe People's Prince — Something remarkable emerges. Fernando moves between worlds with an ease that surprises everyone. Noble children and common children play together in his presence, the barriers softened by his example. Stories spread through Toledo of the young prince who treats a baker's son as a friend. The seeds of a legend are planted.\n96-100\nA New Kind of King — Fernando's gift for connection proves extraordinary. He does not merely befriend common boys—he understands them, speaks their language (literal and figurative), earns their fierce loyalty. When he walks through Toledo's streets, children call his name with genuine affection. The foundations are laid for a reign unlike any Castile has known—a king who is loved not because he is mighty, but because he is known.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

His kindness, curiosity, and willingness to fall down and get back up win hearts. The city boys come to see Fernando, not just the prince. Word spreads that the heir of Castile is \"not like other nobles.\"\n\nThis should be a positive outcome but not extraordinary - a solid success showing Fernando's character shining through and building genuine connections with common children.\n\n\nRoll: 57 — The Prince's Touch\n\n\n\nThe first attempts are awkward.\n\n\nA handful of boys are brought to the Alcázar courtyard—sons of merchants and craftsmen, selected by the servants for their good behavior and clean faces. They arrive scrubbed and terrified, bowing so deeply their foreheads nearly touch the cobblestones. When Fernando approaches with the leather ball, they flinch.\n\n\n\"Do you want to play?\" Fernando asks.\n\n\nThey stare at him as if he has spoken Greek.\n\n\nThe game that follows is painful to watch. The city boys pass the ball to Fernando immediately whenever they touch it, as if holding it in his presence were a crime. They refuse to tackle him—refuse even to touch him. When Fernando falls during a collision with Pedro, one boy bursts into tears, convinced he will be executed for witnessing the prince's humiliation.\n\n\nFernando sits in the mud, watching the sobbing child, his face a mixture of confusion and disappointment.\n\n\n\"I am not hurt,\" he says quietly. \"I fall all the time. It is part of the game.\"\n\n\nBut the damage is done. The boys are sent home, and Fernando retreats to his chambers, subdued.\n\n\n\nYou find him that evening, staring out a window at the city below.\n\n\n\"They were afraid of me, Papa,\" he says without turning. \"Not of me—of what I am. The crown. The guards. The palace.\" He presses his palm against the cold glass. \"How do I take those things off?\"\n\n\n\"You cannot,\" you tell him. \"But you can show them that those things are not all you are.\"\n\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\n\"By trying again. And again. Until they believe you.\"\n\n\n\nHe tries again.\n\n\nThis time, Fernando asks to go to them—to play in the Plaza de Zocodover, where the common children gather. The guards protest. Álvaro raises concerns. But you permit it, with a discreet escort watching from a distance.\n\n\nFernando walks into the plaza in simple clothes—good wool, but nothing that screams prince. Pedro accompanies him, a familiar face to ease the transition. They bring the ball.\n\n\nThe city children watch from a distance, whispering. They know who he is. Everyone knows who he is.\n\n\nFernando does not approach them directly. Instead, he and Pedro begin to play—just the two of them, kicking the ball back and forth, laughing when they miss, chasing it across the stones. They play as if no one is watching.\n\n\nIt takes nearly an hour.\n\n\nFinally, a boy edges closer. He is perhaps six, with a dirty face and quick eyes—a baker's son, you later learn, named Tomás.\n\n\n\"Can I play?\" he asks, half-defiant, half-terrified.\n\n\nFernando smiles. \"Yes. You are on my team.\"\n\n\n\nTomás becomes the bridge.\n\n\nHe is not awed by princes. His father sells bread to nobles and commoners alike; he has learned that everyone needs to eat, and coins spend the same regardless of whose purse they come from. He treats Fernando like any other boy—which means he tackles him without hesitation, argues over rules, and once calls him a \"clumsy goat\" when Fernando trips over his own feet.\n\n\nFernando laughs.\n\n\nOther children see this. They see the prince fall and rise, see him accept insults with good humor, see him share the ball rather than dominate it. Slowly, cautiously, they drift closer.\n\n\nBy the end of the first week, there are six boys playing regularly.\n\n\nBy the end of the first month, there are a dozen.\n\n\n\nFernando learns their names. All of them.\n\n\nTomás the baker's son. Rodrigo, whose father mends shoes. Little Gaspar, the orphan who sleeps in the church doorway and plays with a ferocity born of having nothing to lose. Martín, whose mother sells fish in the market and whose hands always smell of salt and scales. Diego and Alonso, the cooper's twins, who move as one unit on the field and finish each other's sentences.\n\n\nHe learns more than names. He learns that Tomás's father rises before dawn to start the ovens. That Rodrigo's family cannot afford meat except on feast days. That Gaspar has no family at all, and that the other boys share their bread with him without being asked.\n\n\n\"Why do they do that?\" Fernando asks Pedro one evening, walking back to the Alcázar. \"Share with Gaspar? They have so little themselves.\"\n\n\nPedro shrugs. \"Because he is one of them. You protect your own.\"\n\n\nFernando is quiet for a long moment.\n\n\n\"I want to be one of them,\" he says finally. \"Not above them. One of them.\"\n\n\n\"You cannot be, Your Highness,\" Pedro says gently. \"You will be king.\"\n\n\n\"Then I will be a king who remembers their names.\"\n\n\n\nWord spreads through Toledo.\n\n\nThe merchants whisper about it in La Llotja. The craftsmen discuss it in their guilds. The servants carry tales to every noble house: The Prince of Asturias plays with common boys in the plaza. He knows their names. He lets them tackle him. He shares his food with the orphan.\n\n\nSome nobles are scandalized. A prince should not dirty himself with commoners. It is unseemly. It undermines the dignity of the crown.\n\n\nBut others—particularly those who remember the cold distance of kings past—see something different. They see a boy who might one day understand his people. A king who might listen before he commands. A ruler who knows that crowns are worn by men, and men are made of the same clay as bakers and cobblers and fishwives.\n\n\nDon Álvaro reports the gossip to you with a carefully neutral expression.\n\n\n\"They call him el príncipe llano,\" he says. \"The plain prince. Some mean it as an insult. Others...\" He pauses. \"Others say it with something like hope.\"\n\n\n\nFernando continues to play, week after week, month after month. The friendships deepen. He learns which boys can be trusted with secrets, which ones boast too freely, which ones lead and which ones follow. He learns to read faces, to sense moods, to know when Tomás is worried about his father's cough or when Gaspar has gone hungry the night before.\n\n\nHe brings food, sometimes—not ostentatiously, but quietly. Extra bread from the palace kitchens. Apples from the royal orchards. He never announces it, never makes it charity. He simply shares, as the boys share with each other.\n\n\nOne afternoon, after a particularly muddy game, Tomás walks beside Fernando toward the plaza's edge where the guards wait.\n\n\n\"You are strange, you know,\" Tomás says. \"For a prince.\"\n\n\n\"Strange how?\"\n\n\n\"You actually like us. Most nobles, they look at us like we are dogs. Useful, maybe, but not... people.\" Tomás kicks a pebble, watching it skitter across the stones. \"But you look at us like we matter.\"\n\n\nFernando considers this.\n\n\n\"You do matter,\" he says simply. \"My father says a king is nothing without his people. What use is a crown if no one follows you? What use is a castle if no one defends it?\"\n\n\nHe stops, turning to face Tomás.\n\n\n\"Someday I will be king. And when I am, I will need men I can trust. Men who know me—really know me. Not the crown. Me.\" He offers his hand. \"Will you be one of those men, Tomás?\"\n\n\nTomás stares at the offered hand. A prince's hand, extended to a baker's son in a muddy plaza.\n\n\nHe takes it.\n\n\n\"Yes,\" he says. \"I will.\""

      "say": "Thought process: Excavating expedition records and correspondence details.\n\nThe user is asking about the exploration missions, specifically the Timbuktu expedition. Let me search for information about this in the project files.\n\nFrom Chapter_2_40_Summary.md, I found:\n\n\"### African Exploration Correspondence\n- Juan writes to Prince Henry requesting Senegal outpost and Timbuktu expedition\n- **Funding approved**: 40,000 florins over three years\n- 15,000 florins for Senegal outpost (São Tomé da Ribeira)\n- Remainder for inland expedition to Mali\n- **Expedition Chaos Roll: 91 (Exceptional Achievement)** — Results in 1439:\n  - Expedition reaches Timbuktu and meets Mansa Mahmud II\n  - Treaty of Timbuktu signed: trading privileges, Christian quarter permitted\n  - Malian ambassador Musa Keita returns with expedition\n  - 600 pounds of gold ingots, detailed maps, formal agreements\n  - 13 of 32 expedition members died\"\n\nSo the expedition roll was already made (91 - Exceptional Achievement) and the results are expected in 1439. The current timeline is January 1438, so the expedition has not yet returned.\n\nLet me search for more context about the timeline and African ventures.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Ascertained expedition's ongoing status and projected return timeline.\n\nBased on my search, I can see that the Timbuktu/Mali expedition was funded in 1436 and the results are expected in 1439 (Roll: 91 - Exceptional Achievement). The current timeline is January 1438, so the expedition has not yet returned.\n\nThe expected results when they do return in 1439:\n- Expedition reaches Timbuktu and meets Mansa Mahmud II\n- Treaty of Timbuktu signed: trading privileges, Christian quarter permitted\n- Malian ambassador Musa Keita returns with expedition\n- 600 pounds of gold ingots, detailed maps, formal agreements\n- 13 of 32 expedition members died\n\nSo the expedition is still underway and won't return until 1439.\n\n\nThe Timbuktu expedition has not yet returned.\n\n\nYou recall the correspondence with Prince Henry in 1436—forty thousand florins approved over three years, fifteen thousand for the Senegal outpost at São Tomé da Ribeira, the remainder for the inland expedition to Mali. The men departed that same year, a small party of thirty-two souls venturing into lands no Christian had seen since ancient times.\n\n\nThe results are not expected until 1439—the journey is immense, the distances almost incomprehensible. The expedition must travel down the African coast by ship, establish contact with local traders, arrange guides and provisions, then venture overland across the Sahara to reach Timbuktu itself. Even if successful, the return journey will take months more.\n\n\nWhat has arrived, however, are periodic reports from the coastal outposts.\n\n\nDon Álvaro finds you the morning after the ball game, a leather dispatch case under his arm.\n\n\n\"News from the African ventures, Your Majesty,\" he says, settling into a chair across from you in the solar. \"Prince Henry's latest correspondence, arrived by way of Lisbon.\"\n\n\nHe extracts a letter bearing the Portuguese seal.\n\n\n\"The Senegal outpost—São João da Ribeira—is operational. They have established trade with local chieftains. Gold dust, ivory, and slaves flow through the post, though in modest quantities thus far.\" He pauses. \"Henry writes that the inland expedition passed through the outpost eight months ago, heading east toward the Niger. They were in good health and spirits. That is the last confirmed sighting.\"\n\n\nHe sets the letter down.\n\n\n\"We will know nothing more until they return—or until word comes that they will not.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"It is a long time to wait, Your Majesty. But the roll of the dice was favorable. If God wills it, they will return with wonders.\""
