Let me do that.\n\n\nView: Reading the CHARACTER_DATABASE for current character locations and status\n\n\nThought process: Retrieved character database and located previous chapter summary.\n\nGood, I have the character database.

Let me find and read that file.\n\n\nView: Reading the most recent chapter summary (Chapter 2.40) to understand where we left off\n\n\nThought process: Orchestrated narrative setup for chapter continuation.\n\nNow I have all the information I need to start Chapter 2.41. Let me summarize:\n\n**Current State:**\n- **Date/Time**: Summer 1436, late afternoon after Cortes presentation concludes\n- **Location**: Alcázar of Toledo, returning to private apartments\n- **Present**: Juan, Lucia (pregnant), Catalina, Fernando, Bianca, Teresa, guards, nurses\n- **Situation**: Cortes concluded successfully; family returning home after presentation\n\nI should present the chapter introduction exactly where we left off - the family returning to private apartments after the Cortes presentation. The children have just performed, Catalina legendarily well, Fernando acceptably.\n\nI'll set the scene in the private apartments as they settle in after the emotionally intense day.\n\n\nChapter 2.41\n\n\nSummer 1436, Late Afternoon\n\n\nThe private corridors of the Alcázar are blessedly cool after the stifling heat of the Great Hall. Your footsteps echo on stone worn smooth by generations of Castilian kings as you walk beside Lucia, her hand resting lightly on the swell of her belly. The guards have spread out—two ahead, two behind, and the children's protectors flanking their charges with practiced vigilance.\n\n\nCatalina walks a few paces ahead, her small spine still straight with that unnatural poise that so captivated the assembled lords. She has not spoken since leaving the hall, but you catch glimpses of her face in the torchlight—not triumphant, not exhausted, but calculating, as if reviewing her performance for flaws to correct. Behind her, Fernando clings to his nurse's hand, his fine clothes already rumpled, his earlier shyness having given way to a quiet exhaustion. Bianca toddles between them, oblivious to the day's significance, while Teresa sleeps in her nurse's arms.\n\n\nThe Count of Alba's words echo in your mind: A danger beyond reckoning.\n\n\n\"The Duke of Medina Sidonia asked twice when Catalina might visit his estates,\" Lucia murmurs, low enough for only you to hear. \"And Count Benavente's invitation was genuine—I saw his face. She has made admirers of men who would normally dismiss a child.\" She pauses. \"She also has the Archbishop's attention now. And Torquemada was watching her very closely during the blessing.\"\n\n\nYou reach the door to the family apartments. A servant opens it, and warm light spills out—lamps already lit, a small fire in the hearth despite the season (Lucia feels cold easily now). The children's evening meal waits on a low table. Normalcy, after a day that was anything but."

I need to check what one-time expenses have been made in 1436 and what information exists about the budget.\n\nLet me think about what I know from the chapter summaries:\n- From Chapter 2.40, we know:\n  - Foundry expansion was approved: 6,000 florins one-time investment\n  - African expedition funding: 40,000 florins over three years (so maybe 13,333 per year or front-loaded)\n  - There was mention of a punitive expedition against Sale in Africa\n\nI should check the financial spreadsheets to understand the current state of finances. The user mentioned the Sale expedition - I need to search for information about this.\n\nLet me search project knowledge for information about the Sale expedition and 1436 finances.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Hunted for specifics on the Sale expedition's financial records.\n\nI found information about the Sale raid mentioned in Chapter 2.39 but I need more specific details about 1436 expenses.

Let me check the existing finance files to see what data they contain. The user is asking about 1436 one-time expenses. From the search results, I can see:\n\n1. From Chapter 2.40 Summary:\n   - Foundry Expansion Approved: 6,000 florins one-time investment\n   - African expedition funding: 40,000 florins over three years for Prince Henry\n\n2. The Salé raid was mentioned as a \"punitive expedition\" in Chapter 2.32 summary as a \"future punitive campaign against Salé corsairs\" - it was planned but I need to check if it actually happened and what it cost.\n\nLet me now have Diego respond to Juan's question in character. Diego would need to compile the 1436 expenses data. The information I've gathered suggests:\n\n1436 One-Time Expenses:\n- Foundry expansion: 6,000 florins\n- African expedition funding for Prince Henry: This was 40,000 florins over 3 years, so perhaps ~13,333 per year\n- Salé punitive expedition - need to check if this happened\n\nI should have Diego respond and explain what he knows about 1436 finances.\n\n\nA servant is dispatched. You settle the children with their nurses—Catalina already recovered from her performance and asking pointed questions about the Duke of Medina Sidonia's family history, Fernando clutching a small wooden knight and looking relieved to be away from the crowd.\n\n\nPerhaps a quarter-hour passes before Diego de Daza arrives, ink-stained fingers and a leather satchel stuffed with documents marking his perpetual state of industrious preparation. He bows to Lucia, then to you.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty summoned me. I came directly from the counting house.\"\n\n\nHe takes a seat when you gesture, pulling a wax tablet from his satchel—his portable notes, always at hand.\n\n\nAt your question about one-time expenses for 1436, Diego consults his tablet and frowns thoughtfully.\n\n\n\"The Salé expedition... yes, Your Majesty, that was authorized.\" He flips through notes. \"A punitive raid against the corsairs who have been troubling the Strait. The fleet conducted operations in the spring—I would need to pull the final accounting, but I believe we allocated approximately eight to ten thousand florins for the operation itself. Supplies, crew bonuses, ammunition expended.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, thinking. \"Beyond that... the major one-time expense this year was the foundry expansion—six thousand florins for the second furnace and workforce recruitment, as approved during your review with Signore Calabrese.\"\n\n\nDiego taps his stylus against the tablet. \"And there is the continuing African commitment—the forty thousand florins to Prince Henry for the Senegal outpost and Timbuktu expedition was committed this year, though it disburses over three years. I would need to confirm how much has actually been sent versus pledged.\"\n\n\nHe looks up. \"For the definitive budget, Your Majesty, I require clarity on a few matters. First, should the African disbursements be counted as one-time expenses in the year pledged, or split across the years of actual payment? Second, the naval operating costs have increased significantly—Admiral Vilaragut reports the combined fleet now requires closer to forty-five thousand florins annually rather than the thirty-seven thousand projected. Do you wish me to revise projections accordingly?\"\n\n\nHe hesitates. \"And there is the matter of the Barcelona journey next spring. A royal progress with the full family, guards, and appropriate state... that will not be inexpensive. Shall I include an estimate for that as well?\""

Castilian crown revenues of three hundred seventy-three thousand, Constantinople contributing nearly eight thousand as the settlement matures, and the first five hundred florins from São João da Ribeira.\n\n\nTotal Expenses: Three hundred nineteen thousand florins. Annual recurring expenses have risen to two hundred twenty-three thousand—the naval operations increase accounting for most of that. The one-time expenses total ninety-six thousand: the African expedition at forty thousand, the Salé punitive action at ten thousand, foundry expansion at six thousand, wool breeding continuation at six thousand, Constantinople commitments at thirty thousand, and naval development at four thousand.\"\n\n\nHe looks up from the parchment. \"The net position is a surplus of sixty-two thousand, eight hundred fifty florins. This brings the year-end treasury to five hundred eighty-five thousand, six hundred fifty-one florins.\"\n\n\nDiego permits himself a small smile—a rare expression from the usually dour administrator. \"A recovery from the investment year of 1435, Your Majesty. The heavy expenditures on African ventures, Constantinople, and naval development are beginning to bear fruit. If the projections hold, we should see the treasury exceed one million florins by 1439, and approach one and a half million by 1441.\"\n\n\nHe sets down the parchment. \"The document is complete.

      "say": "Thought process: Constructed historically-grounded childbirth outcomes table accounting for maternal health factors.\n\nThe user wants to advance time to Lucia's next delivery, which according to the chapter summary is due November/December 1436. I need to create a realistic d100 table for childbirth in the 15th century.\n\nLet me think about what factors are relevant here:\n\n**Lucia's situation:**\n- Age: 25-26 (born ~1409-1410, so in late 1436 she'd be about 26-27)\n- This is her second pregnancy (Bianca was born September 14, 1434)\n- First delivery was normal (Roll: 44)\n- She's described as being in \"exceptional health\" during this pregnancy\n- She's had a full-term pregnancy before with no complications\n\n**Historical context for childbirth in the 15th century:**\n- Maternal mortality was high - estimates range from 1-3% per birth in good conditions\n- Infant mortality was also significant\n- Second pregnancies were generally safer than first pregnancies\n- Age 26-27 was considered ideal childbearing age\n- Royal women had access to the best medical care available\n- However, \"best care\" in 1436 was still quite primitive by modern standards\n\n**Factors that favor a good outcome:**\n- Lucia is young and healthy\n- Previous successful delivery\n- Royal medical care (best available)\n- Described as having \"exceptional health\" during this pregnancy\n- Second birth tends to be easier than first\n\n**Factors that could cause problems:**\n- This is the 15th century - complications we'd easily handle today were often fatal\n- Childbirth is inherently dangerous\n- No modern interventions available\n\nLet me draft a realistic d100 table. I should avoid being overly optimistic just because she's a royal - medieval queens died in childbirth regularly. But I also shouldn't be unnecessarily harsh given the positive factors.\n\nLooking at historical data:\n- About 1-2% of births resulted in maternal death even in good conditions\n- About 10-15% of births had significant complications\n\n\n- Most births (maybe 60-70%) were relatively straightforward\n- Some births (maybe 15-20%) were exceptionally easy\n\nFor a second birth with a healthy mother, I'll adjust the probabilities to reflect her favorable circumstances. The table will prioritize positive outcomes while maintaining historical realism, with slightly higher chances of smooth delivery given her youth, health, and previous successful pregnancy.\n\nPotential complications range from minor to life-threatening, including breech presentation, cord issues, hemorrhage, and infection. These risks could dramatically alter the birth's trajectory, impacting both maternal and infant survival. I'll carefully map out potential scenarios, balancing medical knowledge of the time with statistical probability.\n\nThe comprehensive table will capture nuanced birth outcomes, acknowledging the complex medical landscape of historical childbirth. Each probability range represents a potential path - from tragic loss to joyous, uncomplicated delivery.\n\n\nThe weeks pass. Autumn deepens into winter, the leaves falling from the trees in the courtyards of the Alcázar. Lucia grows heavy with child, her movements slower but her spirits high. The midwives have been summoned, the birthing chamber prepared, candles lit before the image of Our Lady.\n\n\n\nCHILDBIRTH TABLE: Queen Lucia, November/December 1436\n\n\nThird pregnancy (Bianca September 1434, current child). Mother age 26-27. Previous delivery normal (Roll: 44). Current pregnancy described as \"exceptional health.\"\n\n\n\nFAVORABLE FACTORS:\n\n\nSecond delivery (bodies adapt; first births are most dangerous)\n\nOptimal childbearing age (mid-20s)\n\nExcellent health throughout pregnancy\n\nRoyal medical care (best midwives, physicians available)\n\nNo complications during pregnancy\n\n\nRISK FACTORS:\n\n\nThis is the 15th century (no antiseptics, no blood transfusions, no surgical intervention for most complications)\n\nChildbirth remains inherently dangerous regardless of circumstances\n\nEven healthy pregnancies can develop sudden complications\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-2\nCatastrophe. Something goes terribly wrong—hemorrhage, obstructed labor, or cord accident. Despite all efforts, the Queen cannot be saved. The child may or may not survive. The realm mourns. Juan faces the loss of a second wife to childbirth.\n3-6\nLife-threatening complication. Severe hemorrhage, prolonged obstructed labor, or dangerous presentation. Lucia survives but barely—weeks of recovery, permanent health damage possible. Physicians warn future pregnancies would be extremely dangerous. Child's survival uncertain (separate roll).\n7-15\nSerious difficulty. Breech presentation, cord issues, or significant bleeding. Midwives and physicians work for many hours. Lucia exhausted and weakened, requiring extended recovery (4-6 weeks bedridden). Child delivered alive but may be fragile. Physicians advise caution regarding future pregnancies.\n16-30\nDifficult but manageable. Labor is long (12-18 hours) with some complications—minor malpresentation corrected, moderate bleeding controlled. Lucia tired and sore but recovers normally within 2-3 weeks. Healthy child delivered.\n31-55\nNormal delivery. Labor proceeds as expected (8-12 hours). Some pain and difficulty, as is natural, but no significant complications. Lucia recovers well. Healthy child, good weight, strong cry. The midwives are satisfied.\n56-75\nSmooth delivery. Quicker than expected (5-8 hours). Lucia's body remembers the process from Bianca's birth. Minimal complications, easy recovery. Healthy, robust child. Lucia walking within days.\n76-90\nExcellent delivery. Remarkably swift and uncomplicated (3-5 hours). Lucia handles it with grace and strength. Healthy child, excellent condition. Physicians note the Queen's constitution is exceptional. Quick recovery—she attends Mass within the week.\n91-99\nBlessed birth. Almost effortless by the standards of the age. Labor short, delivery clean, mother and child both thriving. The midwives cross themselves and speak of God's favor. Lucia radiant within days. The child notably healthy and strong—good omens noted.\n100\nMiraculous. The birth proceeds with such ease that the attendants are astonished. Lucia delivers quickly, with minimal pain, and recovers as if she had merely taken a long nap. The child is perfect—strong, beautiful, crying lustily. Whispers spread through the court of divine blessing upon the House of Trastámara. Clergy note the auspicious signs.\n\n\nCHILD GENDER (if delivery successful):\n\n\nRoll 1-48: Daughter\n\nRoll 49-100: Son\n\n\n\nThe candles burn low in the birthing chamber.

And tell him—\" a ghost of her sharp humor surfaces through the exhaustion— \"tell him I expect a suitable name to be ready. I have done my part.\"\n\n\n\nThe servant finds you in the antechamber where you have been waiting, surrounded by anxious courtiers and the quiet prayers of your confessor.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, bowing low. \"The Queen is delivered safely. A daughter, healthy and strong. Her Majesty asks that you attend her—and requests that you have chosen a name.\"\n\n\nThe courtiers murmur their congratulations. Another princess for Castile. Another life in the nursery.\n\n\n\nWhat name will you give your fourth child, Your Majesty? And will you go to Lucia now?"

      "say": "Thought process: Examined historical naming conventions and cultural significance.\n\nThe user is asking about naming their daughter Joanna. Let me think about this historically.\n\nIn 15th century Castile, \"Joanna\" would be rendered as \"Juana\" in Spanish. This is actually a very appropriate name for the period and the dynasty.\n\nHistorical context:\n- Juana is the Spanish feminine form of Juan (John)\n- It would honor Juan II himself - naming a daughter after the father\n- There were several notable Juanas in Castilian/Spanish history\n- Juana of Castile (Juana la Loca) was actually the daughter of Isabella I and Ferdinand II, born 1479\n- In this timeline, Juan II naming a daughter Juana would be a way of honoring his own name/lineage\n\nThis is actually a very fitting choice. The name would be \"Juana\" in Castilian Spanish, though \"Joanna\" is the Latinized/English form.\n\nI should present this as a reasonable choice, perhaps have Lucia react to it, and note the significance of naming the child after the King himself.\n\n\nThe name settles in your mind as you rise from your chair. Juana—the Castilian form, the feminine of your own name. A daughter who carries something of her father in her very identity.\n\n\nYou make your way through the corridors to the birthing chamber, the courtiers falling back to let you pass. The guards at the door open it silently, and you step into the warm, close air of the room—the smell of herbs and clean linen, the soft light of candles, the quiet efficiency of women's work completed.\n\n\nLucia lies propped against pillows, pale but peaceful, the infant cradled against her. She looks up at your entrance, and some of the weariness lifts from her face.\n\n\n\"Husband,\" she says. \"Come meet your daughter.\"\n\n\nYou approach the bed. The child is tiny—they always seem impossibly small, these new lives—but her color is good, her breathing steady. Dark hair, like her mother. Eyes still that unfocused newborn blue that will change in the weeks to come.\n\n\n\"The servant said you wished me to have a name ready,\" you say.\n\n\nLucia's grey-green eyes sharpen with interest, that keen intelligence undiminished by exhaustion. \"And do you?\"\n\n\n\"Juana.\"\n\n\nShe considers this for a moment, looking down at the child, then back at you. A slow smile crosses her face—genuine, warm, with just a hint of that sharp humor she never quite loses.\n\n\n\"Juana,\" she repeats, testing the sound of it. \"After her father. You are not usually so vain, my lord.\" But there is no criticism in it—only affection. \"It is a good name. Strong. Castilian. She will carry it well.\"\n\n\nShe shifts the infant slightly, offering you a better view. \"Juana of Castile. Fourth child of Juan II and Lucia d'Este. Sister to Fernando, Catalina, and Bianca.\"\n\n\nThe baby stirs, makes a small sound of discontent, then settles again.\n\n\n\"Four children,\" Lucia says quietly. \"Three daughters and an heir. And I am not yet twenty-eight.\" She meets your eyes. \"The dynasty is secure, husband. Whatever else may come.\"\n\n\n\nIs there anything you wish to say to Lucia, or shall we move forward in time?"

Let me check the character database again.\n\nFrom the Chapter 2.40 Summary:\n- Queen Lucia: Pregnant (due Nov/Dec 1436)\n- Princess Catalina (4)\n- Prince Fernando (3)\n- Princess Bianca (2)\n- Princess Teresa (1): Infant, carried by nurse\n\nSo the children are:\n1. Catalina - born January 28, 1432 (daughter of Isabel)\n2. Fernando - born August 3, 1433 (son of Isabel, who died in childbirth)\n3. Bianca - born September 14, 1434 (daughter of Lucia)\n4. Teresa - born sometime in 1435 (daughter of Lucia) - I missed this!\n5. Juana - just born November/December 1436 (daughter of Lucia)\n\nSo Juan has five children now, not four. The user is correct. I made an error - I forgot about Teresa.\n\nLet me also check - Catalina is from Isabel (first wife), Fernando is from Isabel (first wife who died giving birth to him). Then Lucia married Juan in December 1433. Bianca was born September 1434. Teresa must have been born in 1435 (the summary says she's 1 year old in Summer 1436).\n\nSo:\n- Isabel's children: Catalina, Fernando\n- Lucia's children: Bianca, Teresa, Juana\n\nFive children total, three daughters from Lucia specifically. But Lucia said \"three daughters and an heir\" which would be wrong because:\n- Catalina (Isabel's daughter)\n- Fernando (Isabel's son, the heir)\n- Bianca (Lucia's daughter)\n- Teresa (Lucia's daughter)\n- Juana (Lucia's daughter)\n\nThat's actually FOUR daughters and one son/heir. So Lucia should have said \"Four daughters and an heir.\"\n\nLet me correct this.\n\n\nYou are correct—I misspoke.\n\n\nLucia's smile takes on a slightly sharper edge, the exhaustion making her less guarded than usual. \"Five children,\" she corrects herself, shaking her head slightly. \"Forgive me. The hours blur together.\"\n\n\nShe counts them off on her fingers, a gesture almost girlish despite her weariness: \"Catalina—Isabel's daughter, but mine now in all the ways that matter. Fernando, the heir. Then my three: Bianca, Teresa, and now little Juana.\"\n\n\nShe looks down at the infant in her arms. \"Five children in less than five years of marriage. Four daughters and an heir.\" A quiet laugh. \"My uncle Niccolò would be impressed. The Este were never so prolific.\"\n\n\nThe fire crackles in the hearth. Somewhere in the Alcázar, the other children sleep in their nursery—Catalina nearly five now, already the terror and delight of the court; Fernando at three, gentle and brilliant; Bianca a sturdy two-year-old; Teresa barely walking.\n\n\nAnd now Juana, minutes old, adding her small weight to the future of the dynasty.\n\n\n\"The nursery will need more space,\" Lucia observes practically, even as her eyes grow heavy. \"And more nurses. And eventually, more tutors.\" She stifles a yawn. \"But those are problems for tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\nIs there anything you wish to say to Lucia, or shall we move forward?"
