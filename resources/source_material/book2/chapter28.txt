CHAPTER 2.28: THE SULTAN'S REPLY
Date: July 4, 1434
Location: Naples, Kingdom of Naples

THE SITUATION
Victory hangs in the summer air like the scent of orange blossoms. Three days ago, René of Anjou's army surrendered at Aversa—a desperate cavalry charge broken against Castilian steel, followed by French soldiers weeping with relief as they laid down their arms. Yesterday, Queen Joanna II named Alfonso V her heir before the assembled nobility of Naples. The Calabrian barons knelt; the French claimant departed with his honor intact but his ambitions extinguished.

The Kingdom of Naples is secure.

Now Juan finds himself in that strange pause between crises—the brief calm that medieval kings learn to distrust. Lucia, six months heavy with child, rests at the Palazzo Caracciolo, her sharp tongue only slightly dulled by the summer heat. The 800 crusaders who marched from Granada to Rome to Basel to Rhodes to Constantinople to Naples wait for their next purpose. Alfonso V, newly confirmed as Joanna's heir, is already turning his considerable energy toward the administrative work of claiming his prize.

And somewhere across the Adriatic, Sultan Murad II considers a Castilian king's unprecedented request for a meeting.

The Sultan's reply—cautious engagement, agreeing that a meeting "may be possible"—was dispatched weeks ago. Intermediaries have been discussed. Conditions remain to be negotiated. That response should arrive any day now, if it hasn't already reached the port.

The outstanding threads:

The Ottoman Question: What conditions will the Sultan propose? What does Juan actually hope to achieve in a meeting with the most powerful Muslim ruler in the world?
Constantinople: 715 Military Order soldiers hold the walls under Don Juan de Sotomayor. The Hospitaller reinforcement (150 men, 2 galleys) is committed. Emperor John VIII acts independently but gratefully. The city holds—for now.
Lucia: Expected to deliver in late August or September. Juan promised to be present. That promise constrains his movements.
The Return: Castile awaits its king. Fernando and Catalina grow without their father. The administrative apparatus Álvaro built continues to function, but a kingdom can only run on momentum for so long.
The Succession: Alfonso has sworn a sacred oath to serve as regent and Defensor Romaniae if Juan falls. The houses of Castile and Aragón are bound as one blood, one purpose.
The morning light streams through the windows of whatever chamber Juan occupies. Naples stirs outside—a city suddenly certain of its future after months of siege and uncertainty.

What does the King of Castile do this fourth day of July, in the year of our Lord fourteen hundred and thirty-four?

GM: The 800 who went Rome and Basel were an entirely different group than the military order soldiers now in Constantinople and with Juan (200 of them). Juan promised 1000 military order soldiers to Constantinople and delivered. The other group were crusaders that have since been disbanded and are now enjoying lives in Grenada living off grants given to then for their service. 

I go to ALfonso and discuss the situation with him. 

Alfonso, I have been declared defensor and now that you have accepted the position as my regent should I die, I was hoping we could now formally bind our kingdoms together. As you know I am in a fight with the Ottomans. We are not at war right now but it is only a matter of time. I have committed Castille to this fight and I will name Castille and Leon part of the Defensor arrangements. I will command the defense and offensive military actions across the Byzantine empire, Castille and Leon. I was hoping to add Aragon and Naples to that list. Of course only with your permission. But since we are essentially each other's heir and the situation in Constantinople grants us enormous opportunity if we work together, I was hoping you would at least consider it. 

What do you think?

Synthesized historical context and crafted nuanced negotiation outcome table






Thank you for the correction on the crusaders. Let me search for any additional context on the relationship and then draft the table.


Synthesized historical context and crafted nuanced diplomatic negotiation table








ANALYSIS: ALFONSO V'S PERSPECTIVE
What Juan has done for Alfonso:

October 1433: 40,000 florins for hiring Sforza (unconditional)
October 1433: Fleet of 4 armed carracks as show of force
October 1433: Diplomatic pressure on Genoa and Milan
April 1433: Advocated for Naples claim to Pope Eugenius IV
June-July 1434: 15,000 Castilian soldiers transported to Naples
July 2, 1434: Decisive battle at Aversa—broke René's army with Castilian blood
July 4, 1434: Witnessed Queen Joanna name Alfonso heir
What Alfonso has already committed:

Roll: 100 Sacred Oath: "If you fall, I will be father to your children and guardian to your kingdoms. I will defend Constantinople as if it were Zaragoza. I will carry the cross east and make war upon the infidel until my last breath."
Succession arrangement discussed at Te Deum (agreed to formalize after Rome)
Three-kingdom alliance concept already accepted in principle
What Juan is now asking:

Extend the Defensor arrangements to include Aragón and Naples NOW
Unified military command structure for crusading operations under Juan
Not just "if Juan dies" but active coordination while Juan lives
SUCCESS FACTORS (persistent across all roll levels)
Blood Debt: Alfonso owes his kingdom to Castilian intervention—this is undeniable
Sacred Oath Already Sworn: The Roll: 100 oath already committed him to the Defensor role in contingency
Family Unity: Juan's sister María is Alfonso's queen; they are brothers in every meaningful sense
Spiritual Transformation: Alfonso's humbling at Ponza reoriented him from pride to purpose
Shared Succession: They are already each other's heirs in practice
The Logic: If Alfonso is committed to defend Constantinople after Juan's death, why not coordinate effectively while Juan lives?
FAILURE FACTORS (persistent across all roll levels)
Fresh Crown: Alfonso literally just became Naples' heir—consolidation requires attention
Sovereignty Concerns: Placing kingdoms under another king's command, even for crusading, has implications
Aragonese Court: His own nobles and advisors will have opinions about this
Practical Questions: "Command" is abstract—what does this mean in specific situations?
Timing: Is this the moment for constitutional arrangements, or should Naples stabilize first?
Pride (residual): Even transformed men retain some royal pride
APPROACH EVALUATION
Strengths:

Respectful framing ("I was hoping you would consider")
Acknowledges Alfonso's role as regent and heir
Appeals to shared purpose and opportunity
Builds on existing commitments rather than demanding new ones
Weaknesses:

Vague on practical details—what exactly does "command" mean?
Doesn't address what Alfonso gains beyond what he's already committed to
No face-saving mechanism if he wants to negotiate terms
Timing not addressed—why formalize now rather than after consolidation?
Approach Quality: Solid but not exceptional. The relationship does most of the work here, not the specific argument.

D100 TABLE: Alfonso's Response to Defensor Expansion
Roll	Result	Description
1-5	Offended Refusal	Alfonso's pride—dormant but not dead—flares. "I knelt and swore to guard your children. I did not swear to become your vassal." He reminds Juan that Aragón has never bent knee to Castile. The timing feels like exploitation of his gratitude. He needs time to cool before the relationship can recover. Failure factors dominate completely; success factors dismissed as manipulation.
6-15	Troubled Deflection	Alfonso grows uncomfortable. "You have done everything for me, and now you ask this..." He doesn't refuse outright but raises substantial concerns: his Aragonese nobles would never accept formal subordination; Naples needs his full attention; the Pope hasn't even confirmed his claim yet. He asks to revisit this after Naples is secure—perhaps a year or two. Failure factors raised earnestly; success factors acknowledged but insufficient.
16-30	Cautious Negotiation	Alfonso nods slowly but his expression is guarded. "The principle is sound. We are one house, one purpose. But 'command' is a heavy word between kings." He proposes a lesser arrangement: formal coordination and consultation, mutual defense obligations, joint war councils—but stops short of placing Aragonese forces under Castilian command. He wants partnership, not hierarchy. Mixed result; both factor sets present; genuine negotiation required.
31-50	Conditional Agreement	Alfonso accepts the concept but insists on defining terms. "I will bind Aragón and Naples to the Defensor arrangements—but as partner, not subordinate." He proposes: joint command councils where both kings must agree on major operations; either king may call on the other's forces for crusading purposes; neither may commit the other's forces without consultation. A true alliance of equals rather than unified command. He wants this documented carefully. Success factors resonate; failure factors raised constructively.
51-70	Warm Acceptance with Clarification	Alfonso's face softens. "You won me my kingdom. You ask me to help you defend Christendom. How could I refuse?" He accepts the Defensor framework but asks practical questions: Who commands when both kings are present? How are costs shared? What obligations fall on Naples specifically? He wants to understand the details, but his agreement is genuine. "Draft the documents. I will sign them." Success factors dominate; failure factors become mere practical concerns.
71-85	Enthusiastic Embrace	Alfonso grips Juan's arm. "I wondered when you would ask. I've been waiting." He reveals that since swearing the sacred oath, he's been thinking about exactly this—how to make their alliance operational rather than merely sentimental. He has ideas: Aragonese shipyards could build galleys for Constantinople; Naples could serve as staging point for Eastern operations. "We are not two kings anymore. We are one purpose with two crowns." Success factors embraced fully; failure factors dismissed as irrelevant.
86-95	Profound Commitment	Alfonso's eyes glisten. The man who wept at Ponza, who watched a guard die for his pride, who swore before God to carry the cross—that man speaks now. "When you knelt before Pope Martin and offered everything to God, I thought you were mad. When you conquered Granada, I thought you were lucky. When you came to Naples with fifteen thousand men..." He pauses. "I understand now. This is not politics. This is calling." He will not merely join the Defensor arrangements—he will champion them to his own nobles, to the Pope, to anyone who questions. Extraordinary resonance; success factors become personal conviction.
96-100	Sacred Renewal	Alfonso drops to one knee—again. "I swore once to guard your children if you fell. Let me swear again." His voice carries the weight of a man transformed. "While you live, while I live, let Aragón and Naples stand with Castile as one sword for Christ. Not because you saved my kingdom—that is debt, and debts can be repaid. But because what you are building is what I should have been building for twelve wasted years." He proposes not just acceptance but expansion: formal documents binding both kingdoms, presented to the Pope for blessing, proclaimed throughout Christendom. The House of Trastámara united in purpose eternal. Complete alignment; the alliance transcends politics entirely.
GM Notes:

Given Alfonso's Roll: 100 sacred oath three weeks ago, his spiritual transformation, and Juan's decisive military intervention for Naples, this table is weighted favorably. The failure factors are real but the relationship has accumulated extraordinary goodwill.

The approach is competent but not brilliant—it relies heavily on the existing relationship rather than making a particularly compelling new argument. A more detailed proposal addressing Alfonso's practical concerns might have shifted the ranges upward.

Ready to roll when you are.

Rolled 23

18 dec 2025

Orchestrated cautious diplomatic negotiation with sovereignty concerns




CAUTIOUS NEGOTIATION
Roll: 23 — Partnership, Not Hierarchy

The morning finds Alfonso in the smaller council chamber of Castel Nuovo—the room he has already begun to think of as his, though Queen Joanna still breathes in her apartments above. Maps of southern Italy cover the table, marked with the positions of Calabrian lords whose loyalty remains to be tested. A half-eaten breakfast sits forgotten beside correspondence bearing seals from Barcelona, Valencia, Sicily.

He looks up as Juan enters, and his face transforms—genuine warmth, the smile of a man who owes everything to the man before him. He rises, clasps Juan's arm in the warrior's grip they have shared since the night march to Aversa.

"Juan. Sit, please. Wine? It's Sicilian—not as good as Castilian, I'm told, though I've never believed that particular claim."

He listens as Juan speaks of the Defensor arrangements, of binding the kingdoms together, of unified command for the defense of Constantinople and the inevitable conflict with the Ottomans. His expression shifts as Juan continues—not hostile, but thoughtful. Guarded. The warmth remains, but something else enters his eyes.

When Juan finishes, Alfonso is silent for a long moment. He turns to the window, looking out over the bay where Castilian and Aragonese ships ride at anchor together.

"You have done everything for me," he says finally, his voice quiet. "Everything. The florins when I needed them. The fleet. The diplomacy. Fifteen thousand men who marched through the night and broke René's army while I watched from walls I could not leave." He turns back. "I knelt and swore before God to be father to your children and guardian to your kingdoms. I meant every word. I still mean them."

He moves to the table, his fingers tracing the coastline of southern Italy on the map.

"The principle is sound. We are one house, one purpose—I believe that. But..." He pauses, choosing his words with care. "'Command' is a heavy word between kings, Juan. Even between brothers."

Alfonso meets Juan's eyes directly.

"If I place Aragón and Naples under Castilian command for crusading purposes—even with my full consent, even with joy in my heart—what do my nobles see? What does the Pope see? What does history record?" He shakes his head slowly. "They see the Crown of Aragón subordinated to Castile. They see a king who won his kingdom with another king's army and then... surrendered his sovereignty in gratitude."

He raises a hand before Juan can respond.

"I am not refusing. I am not even reluctant in my heart. But I have nobles in Barcelona who have never forgiven my Italian obsessions. I have Sicilian barons who fear absorption into a greater power. I have a kingdom I have not yet actually held—Joanna lives, and until she dies and I am crowned, I am heir, not king." He gestures at the maps. "And these Calabrian lords who knelt two days ago? Half of them supported René. They are watching to see what kind of king I will be. If my first act is to place my crown beneath another..."

Alfonso sighs, running a hand through his hair.

"What I can offer—what I want to offer—is this: formal coordination. Joint war councils where we plan together as equals. Mutual defense obligations—an attack on Constantinople is an attack on all three kingdoms. Shared intelligence, shared costs, shared purpose." His voice firms. "But when Aragonese soldiers march, an Aragonese commander leads them. When Neapolitan ships sail, they sail under my authority. We fight together, Juan. Not with you commanding and me following."

He steps closer, his expression earnest.

"Is that not enough? We are already each other's heirs. We are already bound by blood and oath and gratitude beyond measure. Must we also have one crown above the other? Can we not be... partners? Two swords wielded by one purpose, rather than one sword with two handles?"

The King of Aragón waits for his brother's response.

Of course, we are partners. And we should take time to consolidate Naples the coming years. And having you crowned king will be an important step. I have spoken with your nobles in Aragon and they indeed are tired of fighting. They deserve a peace hard won. 

In my experience, there are always some nobles who will test your authority. When they do, crush them. And I will help you do so should you accept my aid. I have established a system of crown marshalls in Castille who have been instrumental in exposing those who do not respect crown authority. 

What is important is naval coordination in case the sultan attacks Constantinople. He will bring 100.000 men and I will have to bring an army of a size to match that. An enormous operation that requires many ships. While you consolidate your rule and give your people peace, can you lend me your fleets for transport?

Analyzed negotiation dynamics and Alfonso's competing interests









Alfonso's shoulders relax visibly at Juan's words. The tension that had crept into his posture—the worry that his refusal of unified command might have wounded the relationship—drains away.

"Partners," he repeats, and the word carries weight. "Yes. That is what we are."

He listens to Juan's counsel about rebellious nobles, nodding slowly. "Crown Marshals. Álvaro has written to me about this system—how you've brought the great houses to heel without war, through law and accountability rather than the sword." A rueful smile. "I could use such a system. The Calabrians who knelt two days ago will test me within the year. I know this. They are watching to see if the new king is weak."

When Juan turns to the matter of fleets, Alfonso's expression becomes calculating—not resistant, but practical. The merchant-prince of Barcelona considering logistics.

"One hundred thousand men," he says slowly. "You truly believe the Sultan would commit such a force?"

He moves to the map table, tracing the sea lanes from Naples to Constantinople.

"The Aragonese fleet... at full strength, perhaps sixty galleys, twenty larger vessels. Sicily adds another thirty galleys. Naples..." He pauses, considering. "René's fleet is scattered or captured. Perhaps fifteen serviceable ships once we've sorted through the harbor. But crews are another matter—many fled or died during the siege."

Alfonso straightens, meeting Juan's eyes.

"I can lend you ships. For the defense of Constantinople, for transport of armies, for whatever you need against the Ottoman." He raises a finger. "But I need to understand the timing. When do you envision this great operation? This year? Next? Five years hence?"

He gestures at the map of southern Italy.

"If you need the fleet this autumn, I cannot give it—I must secure my coasts, show strength to the Calabrians, ensure René's remnants do not return with French reinforcements. But if you speak of next year, or the year after..." He nods slowly. "Then yes. We can plan. We can coordinate. The fleet of Aragón-Naples will carry Castilian armies east when the hour comes."

His voice softens.

"Tell me what you are truly planning, Juan. Not the vision—I know the vision. But the plan. When do you expect the Sultan to move? What forces do you intend to gather? Where will they assemble?"

A slight smile crosses his weathered face.

"I have learned, these past months, that you do not speak of things lightly. If you say one hundred thousand Ottomans, you have reason to believe it. Share that reason with me, and we will find a way to answer it together."

I understand your position, and I will help you secure Naples as best I can. 

My strategy is to build up the strength of Constantinople the coming years. Many will settle there, I will train the army and militia. Repair the walls. When the Sultan moves in and starts a siege, I will come with as much as I can as fast as I can. The coming 2 years will be difficult to do so quickly and the sultan knows this. The city is recovering and I have not established my support network. That is why I hope that in time, Aragon and Naples will join the defensor in the war against the muslims. But we have time. The sultan cannot launch an operation immediately. That requires years of preparation from him as well. So we will see. 

In five years we will be so much stronger than we are now. So until then, I will just wait and build our strength. After that, I will probably launch a campain through hungary first combined with an attack from the city to re-take the anastacian wall.

Weighed Alfonso's military sophistication and practical concerns about ambitious strategic vision








Alfonso listens intently, his military mind working through the implications. When Juan finishes, he nods slowly—not the nod of a man agreeing to please, but of one genuinely processing strategy.

"Five years," he murmurs. "Yes. That makes sense. The Sultan cannot conjure one hundred thousand men from nothing either. He must gather them, supply them, move them." He traces an invisible line across the map table. "And every year Constantinople grows stronger is a year he loses advantage."

He pulls a chair closer and sits, gesturing for Juan to join him.

"The Hungarian route..." Alfonso's brow furrows. "János Hunyadi. You have corresponded with him, yes? I have heard of this man—the voivode who actually wins against Ottoman armies. If anyone knows how to campaign through the Balkans, it is him." He pauses. "But Hungary is fractured. The nobles squabble while the Turk watches. Can Hunyadi deliver a unified Hungarian force, or only his own Transylvanian levies?"

He leans back, fingers steepled.

"The Anastasian Wall... you mean to push the Sultan back from Thrace entirely. Not merely defend Constantinople, but reclaim the approaches." A low whistle. "That is not defense, Juan. That is reconquest. That is driving the Ottoman from Europe."

Alfonso is silent for a long moment, weighing something.

"In five years, Naples will be secure. My fleet rebuilt, my nobles cowed or won. Sicily prosperous. Aragón at peace." He meets Juan's eyes. "When that day comes—when you march through Hungary and sail to Constantinople—I will be there. Not just my ships. Me. Alfonso of Aragón, fighting beside you."

His voice drops.

"I wasted twelve years chasing Italian glory for pride. If God grants me the chance to spend the next twelve fighting for something that matters..." He leaves the thought unfinished, but his meaning is clear.

"What of the Pope? Basel? Do they support this vision?"

The pope, Basel, Poland, Hungary, the holy roman empire princes... we will have to conduct diplomacy. But I have good relations with them, God willing we will prevail. 

Will you grant me and my navies and armies use of your roads and ports on our way to Constantinople when the time comes?

18 dec 2025

Assessed straightforward logistical request and determined enthusiastic acceptance appropriate





Alfonso actually laughs—a short, warm sound of genuine amusement.

"Juan, you just won me my kingdom with fifteen thousand men who marched through my roads and sailed into my ports." He spreads his hands. "You ask if you may do again what you have already done? Of course. A thousand times, yes."

He rises, moving to a side table where wine and cups wait. He pours two measures of the Sicilian red and brings one to Juan.

"Naples will provision your armies. Sicilian granaries will feed your soldiers. Aragonese shipyards will repair your vessels. When the hour comes and Castilian banners march east, every port from Barcelona to Taranto will open to them." He offers the cup. "This I can promise without hesitation, without condition, without consultation with any noble or council."

He raises his own cup.

"To the roads and ports of Aragón and Naples—open to the armies of Castile, now and always, for as long as our houses endure."

After drinking, Alfonso sets down his cup and his expression turns more businesslike.

"We should formalize this. A treaty of free passage and mutual support—something my nobles can see, something that binds future generations." He pauses. "Not unified command, but... coordinated purpose. The terms we discussed. Joint councils, shared intelligence, mutual defense, and now free passage for crusading armies."

His eyes meet Juan's steadily.

"Draft it. I will sign it. And when you return to Castile, bring it before your Cortes as I will bring it before mine. Let it be known throughout Christendom that the crowns of Castile, Aragón, and Naples stand as one against the enemies of the faith."

A slight smile.

"Is there anything else you need from me before I begin the tedious work of actually ruling this kingdom you won for me?"

I will draft it, but a few questions. 
Can I include that when the sultan moves or the fight is taken to the Ottomans, Aragon and Naples contribute what they can, understanding that you will use the coming years to consolidate your kingdom?

18 dec 2025

Weighed treaty language clarity against Alfonso's sovereignty concerns








Alfonso pauses, the wine cup halfway to his lips. He sets it down carefully.

"'Contribute what they can,'" he repeats slowly, testing the words. "That is... deliberately vague, is it not?"

He's not hostile—his tone is thoughtful, probing.

"I have already told you I will be there personally when the hour comes. I meant it. But putting words in a treaty that my nobles and my Cortes will read..." He exhales. "They will ask questions. What does 'what they can' mean? Who decides what Aragón can contribute? If Naples faces rebellion, can I withhold forces? If Sicily is threatened by Tunisian pirates, must I still send ships east?"

Alfonso drums his fingers on the table.

"And there is the matter of when this obligation triggers. If the Sultan attacks Constantinople, that is clear—defensive war, sacred duty, no one could object. But if you take the fight to the Ottomans..." He raises an eyebrow. "If you march through Hungary to reclaim Thrace, that is offensive war. Glorious, righteous, but offensive. My nobles will ask: are we obligated to join a war of your choosing, at a time of your choosing?"

He holds up a hand before Juan can respond.

"I am not refusing. I am telling you what questions will be asked, so we can answer them in the document itself." He leans forward. "What if we phrase it thus: Aragón and Naples commit to the defense of Constantinople and to supporting military operations against the Ottoman Empire, with contributions determined by consultation between the crowns based on the capacity of each kingdom at the time."

A slight smile.

"It binds us to the cause. It promises contribution. But it preserves my judgment on what my kingdoms can spare. Does that satisfy your purpose, or do you need something more... binding?"

This is indeed what I had in mind. 

Do you have a need for me and my army now? Do they have to batter down some rebels? Or can I just go home?

18 dec 2025

Weighed Alfonso's authority against practical military needs







Alfonso shakes his head, a hint of wry humor in his expression.

"If I cannot hold Naples with the forces I have after you've shattered René's army and sent him fleeing to France, I deserve to lose it."

He gestures toward the window, toward the city beyond.

"I have three thousand Aragonese veterans. The Neapolitan garrison is swearing to me daily—men who defended these walls for months and watched the French break against Castilian steel. The Calabrian barons have knelt." He shrugs. "Some will test me, as you said. When they do, I will crush them with my own hand. That is how a king establishes authority—not by borrowing another king's army every time a lord grows restless."

His expression softens.

"You have given me everything I needed, Juan. The rest I must earn myself, or it means nothing."

Alfonso moves to clasp Juan's shoulder.

"Take your army home. Your children are growing without their father. Your kingdom has been ruled by regents for... how long now? A year? More?" He pauses, then adds more gently: "And unless I misremember, your wife is six months heavy with child and resting not three streets from here. She will want you present when the time comes, not campaigning in Calabria on my behalf."

A thought crosses his face.

"Speaking of matters requiring your attention—has the Sultan's reply arrived yet? You said it was expected late June or early July. We are now in July..."

He had not yet. I will recieve his reply in due time. 

I go to Lucia. 

Lucia, how are you love? We are done here. I think you would rather stay here than travel to Toledo right?

18 dec 2025

Excavated character motivations and anticipated nuanced response







The Palazzo Caracciolo sits in the better quarter of Naples, its thick stone walls offering some relief from the July heat. Aragonese guards in Alfonso's livery flank the entrance—a gift from the King of Aragón, honoring his oath to protect Lucia as he would his own sister.

You find her in a shaded courtyard, reclining on cushions beneath a lemon tree. Her pregnancy is unmistakable now—six months along, her figure transformed from the tall, slender woman who read your letter aloud in Ferrara and declared she would like to meet this king. Her dark hair is pinned loosely against the heat, and she fans herself with an ivory fan that bears the Este arms.

She looks up as you enter, and her grey-green eyes sharpen with that familiar intelligence.

"Ah, the conquering hero returns from his councils with kings." Her voice carries the gentle mockery you have learned to love. "Is Naples secured? Have you and Alfonso divided the Mediterranean between you over wine and maps?"

She shifts on the cushions, one hand resting on her swollen belly.

When you ask your question, her fan stops mid-motion. She studies you for a long moment.

"Would I rather stay here than travel to Toledo," she repeats slowly. "That is an interesting way to phrase it, my love. Not 'I need you in Toledo' or 'the kingdom requires its queen.' But what I would rather do."

A slight smile plays at her lips.

"Are you asking because you want to know my comfort? Or because you're trying to decide whether to leave me here while you sail off to meet a Sultan?"

NPC RULES:
NPCs are rational and self-interested. They acknowledge what Juan has done but demand more. Low rolls mean hard bargaining, not irrational hostility. Committed allies defend their own stake.
Before NPC dialogue: What do they want? What won't they say? What have they seen?
GM: Remember to never generate dialogue or action for Juan. Instead, just stop. 

Lucia, love! I did not expect such political calculations from you. I ask because I want to know what you want. Probably, we will stay here right? I think that's what you would want but I ask to know for sure.

18 dec 2025

Excavated Lucia's motivations, vulnerabilities, and authentic character voice






Lucia's expression softens at your words, the sharpness giving way to something warmer. She sets down the fan and extends her hand toward you—an invitation to sit beside her on the cushions.

"Forgive me. The heat makes me irritable, and this child makes me suspicious of everything." She places your hand on her belly, where a slight movement can be felt beneath the taut skin. "Your son or daughter is equally irritable, I think. They kick at all hours."

She settles back against the cushions, studying your face.

"What I want..." She considers the word carefully. "I want to not travel by ship while carrying a child, if it can be avoided. The journey from Constantinople to Rhodes to Naples was... unpleasant. The surgeons say sea travel in the final months carries risk."

Her hand finds yours.

"Naples is tolerable. The palazzo is comfortable, Alfonso's guards are attentive, and the Italian physicians here trained in Salerno—the best in Christendom for matters of childbirth, or so they claim." A slight grimace. "And I confess, the thought of months in a swaying carrack, followed by weeks on Castilian roads, followed by arriving in Toledo enormous and exhausted to meet a court that has never seen their new queen..."

She shakes her head.

"So yes. I would rather stay. Have the child here, recover my strength, and meet your kingdom as a queen should—not as a whale being carted through the gates."

Her grey-green eyes search yours.

"But what are your plans, husband? Truly?"

I was going to stay here with you. Unless the sultan attacks Constantinople, I will stay here with you until after the birth and you have recovered. Let Catalina play here. 

Sometimes I wonder how all this constant travel will affect her, always seeing new things, ships, horses, carriages... What sort of person will she become later on?

18 dec 2025

Examined Lucia's motivations, fears, and perspective on family stability







Lucia's face transforms—genuine surprise, then a warmth that reaches her eyes.

"You will stay? Truly?" She pulls your hand closer, pressing it against her cheek for a moment. "I had prepared myself to be brave about it. To tell you that queens must endure, that Constantinople needs you, that I understood." A small laugh escapes her. "I am relieved beyond measure that I do not have to be that noble."

She shifts on the cushions, making room for you beside her. The lemon tree's shade dapples across you both as a faint breeze stirs the courtyard.

When you speak of Catalina, Lucia's expression grows thoughtful.

"I have wondered the same thing," she admits. "She is... what, two and a half years old? And already she has seen more of the world than most nobles see in a lifetime. Rome, Basel, Constantinople, Rhodes, Naples..." She shakes her head slowly. "She will not remember most of it, but it shapes her nonetheless. The sounds, the motion, the endless parade of new faces speaking new languages."

Lucia is quiet for a moment, watching a bird hop along the courtyard wall.

"She may become restless. The kind of woman who cannot stay in one place, who finds castle walls a prison rather than a home." A slight smile. "Or she may crave stability above all else—having known so little of it, she may build walls around herself and never leave them."

Her hand finds yours again.

"What sort of father do you want to be to her, Juan? And to this one?" She touches her belly. "You are building an empire. Defending Christendom. Meeting with sultans and emperors. Where do your children fit in that vision?"

I will first let them develop. They are childres after all. Whatever they are interested in, I will nurture that. If they want to ride, hunt, fish, fight, shoot, sail... I will let them explore this. Then as they grow older, I will put them to work for the crown. Catalina will sooner or later learn that not everything is fun play and crostata's. She will be a princess and I will probably send her on diplomatic missions. But that will depend on who she is going to be, what her talents are and also what she wants.

Examined character dynamics and stepfamily complexities within medieval parenting context









Lucia listens carefully, her thumb tracing absent patterns across the back of your hand. When you finish, she nods slowly.

"That is... more thoughtful than most fathers manage," she says. "My own father—God rest him—had my marriage planned before I could walk. I was a piece on his board, nothing more." A flicker of old bitterness crosses her face before fading. "You speak of letting them discover themselves first. That is rare in a king."

She adjusts her position against the cushions, wincing slightly as the child shifts within her.

"Catalina is sweet. She follows me around the palazzo, chattering in that mix of Castilian and Italian she's invented." A soft smile. "She called me mama yesterday. I did not correct her, though I wonder if I should have."

Lucia's eyes meet yours, and there is something careful in them now.

"She does not remember Isabel, does she? She was so young when..." She leaves the sentence unfinished. "And Fernando will never know his mother at all. Only what we tell him."

She is quiet for a moment.

"I want to do right by them, Juan. Not replace Isabel—I could not even if I wished it. But I do not want them to grow up feeling... divided. Between her memory and my presence." Her hand moves to her belly. "And this one. Will they be siblings truly, or will there always be a wall between Isabel's children and mine?"

T dont think so Lucia. Catalina considers you her mama. She is happy. Just be her mama. And let her enjoy her new brother or sister. 

There is a painting of Isabel in Toledo. When she grows, we will explain to her when it is time. But not yet. 

Lets just enjoy this time of peace and quiet until the baby is born. 

I will stay here for a few months. 

I disband the army. I await message from the sultan. 

What do I recieve?

18 dec 2025

Reconciled timeline inconsistencies and prepared Sultan's diplomatic response








Lucia's expression softens completely. She leans forward—as much as her condition allows—and kisses you gently.

"Then we shall have peace," she murmurs. "For a few months at least."

TIME PASSES
July 1434

The Castilian army disperses. Don Íñigo López de Mendoza sails with the bulk of the forces back to Castile—fifteen thousand men returning home to families, farms, and the ordinary lives of peacetime. The 200 Military Order soldiers who accompanied you from Constantinople remain as your personal guard, quartered in Naples at Alfonso's hospitality.

Letters are dispatched: to Álvaro de Luna in Toledo, informing him of Naples' resolution and your intention to remain until Lucia's delivery; to Don García López de Padilla in Granada, confirming the administration continues in your absence; to the Military Order commanders, acknowledging their soldiers' service.

Alfonso throws himself into the work of consolidating his new kingdom. You see him occasionally—shared dinners, brief consultations—but he is consumed with the business of transforming from heir to king.

The Sultan's Reply

Three weeks after the Battle of Aversa, a Venetian trading vessel arrives in Naples harbor bearing a passenger of note: a Ottoman diplomatic secretary named Hamza Bey, accompanied by four attendants and a document bearing the tughra of Sultan Murad II.

The man requests an audience with the King of Castile.

Do you receive him? And if so, how and where?

Consult the project files as we have already rolled for what the response of the sultan was. 

I go and meet Hamza Bey. Was this not the same ambassador I met in Constantinople?

18 dec 2025

Reconciled character continuity against available diplomatic records






I don't find any record of you meeting Hamza Bey previously in Constantinople. The Ottoman embassy there observed your activities, but there's no named ambassador you met directly. Hamza Bey appears to be a new envoy sent specifically to negotiate the terms of a potential meeting.

Previous Roll Reference: Sultan Murad's response was Roll: 50 — Cautious Engagement. He agreed that a meeting "may be possible" with conditions to be discussed through intermediaries.

THE OTTOMAN ENVOY
You receive Hamza Bey in a modest audience chamber at Castel Nuovo—not Alfonso's throne room (which would imply you speak for Naples), nor a private chamber (which would suggest secrecy). A space befitting a king receiving a diplomatic secretary: respectful but not elevated.

Hamza Bey is a man of perhaps forty-five, with a neatly trimmed beard going grey at the edges and the careful posture of someone who has spent decades navigating the Ottoman court. He wears a green silk robe over a white kaftan—fine but not ostentatious. His attendants remain outside; he enters alone, bearing a leather document case.

He bows—not deeply, but correctly. The bow of an emissary from a great power to the sovereign of another great power.

"As-salamu alaykum, King of Castile," he begins in accented but serviceable Latin, though something in his eyes suggests he noticed the Arabic greeting in your letter. "I am Hamza Bey, secretary to the Divan of Sultan Murad Han, Shadow of God on Earth, Commander of the Faithful. I bring greetings from my master, and his response to your... unusual correspondence."

He opens the document case and produces a scroll bearing the Sultan's tughra—the elaborate calligraphic signature that authenticates all Ottoman imperial documents.

"My master was intrigued by your letter. A Latin king who writes in Arabic, who speaks of understanding rather than crusade, who conquered Granada yet asks questions about the Prophet—peace be upon him—rather than demanding submission." Hamza Bey's expression is carefully neutral. "The Sultan has not encountered this before."

He pauses, measuring his next words.

"His Majesty agrees that a meeting may be possible. But there are matters to discuss first. Questions of location, of protocol, of... purpose." His eyes meet yours. "The Sultan wishes to understand what you truly seek, King of Castile. You write of understanding. You write of delivering tribute on the Emperor's behalf. But you also garrison Constantinople with Latin knights and name yourself Defensor."

He spreads his hands slightly.

"These are contradictory signals. My master is a patient man, but he does not waste time on men who speak peace while preparing war. So I am sent to ask plainly: What do you want?"

GM: There was an Ottoman Bey who I met and I spoke Arabic with him, surprising him. After I was named defensor, I made them leave the city.

18 dec 2025

Reconciled missing encounter details and incorporated player's campaign history





You're right—I apologize for the oversight. The Ottoman embassy that observed your activities in Constantinople would have had a senior representative. Let me acknowledge that encounter.

THE OTTOMAN ENVOY
You receive Hamza Bey in a modest audience chamber at Castel Nuovo. As he enters, something flickers in his expression—recognition.

It is the same man.

He is older than you remembered from those tense weeks in Constantinople—the Ottoman observer who watched your knights drill, who counted your ships, who reported everything to Edirne. The man whose eyes widened when you greeted him in Arabic, breaking every expectation he had of Latin kings.

The man you expelled from Constantinople after the Emperor signed the decree naming you Defensor Romaniae.

"As-salamu alaykum, King of Castile," he says, his Latin careful but his tone carrying a note of... something. Not quite warmth, but perhaps grudging respect. "We meet again. Under different circumstances."

He bows—correctly, neither too deep nor too shallow.

"When you expelled me from Constantinople, I told my master that I had encountered something new. A Latin king who speaks the tongue of the Prophet—peace be upon him—and who acts rather than merely talks." A thin smile. "The Sultan was... intrigued. Your letter intrigued him further."

He produces the scroll bearing the Sultan's tughra.

"His Majesty agrees that a meeting may be possible. But he has questions first." Hamza Bey's eyes meet yours steadily. "You write of understanding. You write of delivering tribute. But you garrison Constantinople with knights and name yourself Defensor. You repair walls the treaty forbade the Greeks to repair. You train militia. You cast cannons."

He spreads his hands.

"My master is patient. But he is not foolish. So he sends me to ask plainly, king to king's servant: What do you want? Peace? Or merely time to prepare for war?"

Right now, the city of Constantinople is owned by the Byzantine empire. And me and the Latins intend to improve trade through this important port. And defense is a natural way to secure this investment. What worth is an investment is someone else can just walk in and take it? 

Constantinople is surrounded on all sides by vast lands owned by the sultan. We pose no threat to him, we merely seek to be able to defend ourselves. The Byzantines have been scraping the tribute together. Now, with investment from the latins, the sultan can be assured tribute reliably. 

Is the sultan making plans to attack and wage war on the Byzantines?

18 dec 2025

Analyzed diplomatic maneuvering and anticipated experienced negotiator's strategic response








Hamza Bey's expression remains carefully neutral, but something shifts in his eyes—a flicker of appreciation, perhaps, for the rhetorical maneuver. You have reframed the question elegantly: if there is to be war, it will be the Sultan's choice to attack, not your choice to provoke.

"The Sultan makes many plans," Hamza Bey replies smoothly. "He is the Shadow of God on Earth, Commander of the Faithful. His responsibilities stretch from the Danube to Anatolia. Constantinople is... one concern among many."

He pauses, choosing his next words with care.

"But you must understand, King of Castile, that my master has heard such words before. 'We seek only to defend ourselves.' 'We mean no threat.' The Venetians said this when they bought Thessalonica. They fortified it. They garrisoned it. They spoke of trade and investment." His voice hardens slightly. "And when the city fell, Venice sued for peace within a year and resumed trading as if nothing had happened. Seven thousand souls enslaved, and the Venetians counted their coins."

He steps closer, his tone more direct now.

"You are not Venice. This my master understands. You conquered Granada. You do not merely talk of holy war—you make holy war. You speak Arabic and ask questions about the Prophet, peace be upon him, yet you drove the Muslims from Iberia after eight hundred years."

Hamza Bey tilts his head, studying you.

"So when you say you seek only defense and reliable tribute... my master wonders. Is this the wolf who has eaten his fill and now wishes to sleep? Or the wolf who rests before the next hunt?"

He reaches into his document case and produces a second scroll—smaller, unsealed.

"The Sultan proposes this: a meeting on neutral ground, as you requested. The island of Tenedos, at the mouth of the Dardanelles. Neither Ottoman nor Byzantine territory—held by Venice, who will guarantee safe passage for both parties. Equal guards—fifty men each. No more."

He offers the scroll.

"But before my master commits to this meeting, he wishes to know: What would you discuss? Trade arrangements, you mentioned. Tribute delivery. These are matters for secretaries, not kings." His eyes bore into yours. "What does the King of Castile wish to say to the Sultan of the Ottomans that requires they meet face to face?"

I will not deny that there is much reason for hostile relations between our people. The Byzantines still consider the old borders of their empire to be the rightfull state of things. And I know that many a sultan has been eying Constantinople hungrily. Right now, there is no reason for conflict. Trade benefits both parties and that is what I want to discuss. 

But most of all. I want to meet him. If there is an incident or conflict. I want to know the man. Who he is and how he will react. He has done things a great ruler would do. I want to look him in the eye and shake his hand. And I feel like the feeling is mutual. 

The arrangement is agreed. As you can see my wife is with child and I will be able to visit next year.

18 dec 2025

Analyzed diplomatic acceptance, weighed mutual respect implications




Hamza Bey listens, and something in his posture relaxes—not entirely, but perceptibly. The tension of a diplomat bracing for lies or evasions eases into something closer to professional respect.

"You are... remarkably honest, King of Castile," he says slowly. "Most rulers would speak only of eternal friendship and mutual benefit. You speak of wanting to know the man you might one day face across a battlefield." A pause. "My master will appreciate this. He has little patience for flattery and less for deception."

He glances toward the window, toward the sunlit city beyond.

"The feeling is mutual. When I returned to Edirne and described you—the Arabic, the questions about faith, the way you moved through Constantinople as if you already owned it—the Sultan listened more carefully than I have seen him listen in years. He said..." Hamza Bey hesitates, as if weighing whether to share this. "He said, 'This one is dangerous. I would like to meet him.'"

He tucks the scroll back into his case.

"Next year, then. Spring, perhaps, when the seas are calm and your child is safely delivered. I will carry your acceptance to my master." He bows—slightly deeper than before, a gesture of genuine respect rather than mere protocol. "The details—exact dates, the number of ships, the arrangements with Venice—these can be negotiated through intermediaries over the winter."

Hamza Bey moves toward the door, then pauses.

"One more thing, King of Castile. My master asked me to observe you. To assess what manner of man you are." His dark eyes meet yours. "I will tell him this: You conquered Granada not through cruelty but through strategy. You took Constantinople's loyalty not through force but through generosity. You speak of defense, but you build alliances that could threaten our borders from Hungary to the Mediterranean."

A thin smile crosses his weathered face.

"I will tell him you are exactly as dangerous as he suspected. And that you would make either a worthy enemy or a valuable... arrangement." He uses the word carefully, avoiding friend or ally—concepts that do not exist between the Cross and the Crescent.

"Ma'a salama, King of Castile. Until Tenedos."

He bows once more and withdraws.

The summer heat presses against the windows. Somewhere in the palazzo, Lucia rests with your unborn child. Alfonso consolidates his new kingdom. Constantinople holds, for now, behind walls your gold repaired.

And next spring, you will meet the most powerful Muslim ruler in the world.

What does Juan do with the remainder of the summer?

I summon what scribes and advisors I have available to me to have a council

18 dec 2025

Inventoried available advisors and scribes in Naples




The council convenes in a modest chamber at the Palazzo Caracciolo—not the grandeur of Toledo's alcázar, but serviceable. The summer heat is tempered by sea breezes through open windows.

Your resources in Naples are limited. The great machinery of Castilian government—Álvaro de Luna, the royal chancery, the treasury officials—remains in Toledo, months away by sea. What you have is a traveling king's skeleton court.

Those Present:

Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles — Commander of your guard, veteran of every campaign since Rome. Practical, loyal, thinks in terms of security and logistics.

Brother Martín de Córdoba — A Franciscan friar who serves as your traveling secretary and chaplain. Educated, capable with Latin and documents, but no political mastermind.

Don Bernat de Centelles — Alfonso's ambassador, still in Naples after coordinating the papal advocacy. Experienced Aragonese diplomat who knows Italian politics intimately.

Queen Lucia — She insisted on attending despite her condition, settling carefully into a cushioned chair. "I did not marry a king to be excluded from councils," she said when Brother Martín hesitated at the door.

Captain Fernán speaks first, as is his habit when assessing a situation: "Your Majesty has met with the Ottoman envoy. What do we face?"

The others wait, watching you.

What matters do you wish to discuss with this council?

Listen. I have been named defensor and have negotiated attractive measures for latins who want to move to Constantinople. They can buy houses chaep, trade and work will pick up. Rights will be respected and we are about to start taking land back from the Ottomans. Crusade has been called and the Greeks have declared Apokatastasis. Any noble who fights for this cause gets titles. Right now, a noble who contributes about 200 men can win himself a ducal title. All the rights are signed into law. There is a muster and we count the number of men who fight this year. How more you contribute, the more titles you get. 

How can we best attract nobles and traders willing to settle in the city?

18 dec 2025

Synthesized council expertise to strategize recruitment across military, religious, merchant, and noble networks








The council stirs with interest. Don Bernat leans forward, his diplomat's mind already working. Lucia's eyes sharpen—this is the kind of problem she understands.

Don Bernat de Centelles speaks first, his Aragonese-accented Castilian measured and thoughtful:

"Your Majesty speaks of attracting settlers. But we must ask: who do we wish to attract, and what do they fear?"

He ticks off points on his fingers.

"The opportunity is extraordinary—I grant this. Ducal titles for two hundred men? In Italy, such titles cost fortunes and take generations to acquire. But..." He pauses. "Constantinople is far. The Turk surrounds it. Men have heard of Thessalonica—seven thousand enslaved, the city sacked. They will ask: why should I risk my family, my fortune, my life, when the Sultan might simply take it all?"

He spreads his hands. "The terms matter less than the confidence. Men must believe Constantinople will stand."

Captain Fernán grunts in agreement.

"Don Bernat speaks true. Soldiers I can find—there are always men willing to fight for pay and glory. But settlers? Men who bring wives, children, gold to invest?" He shakes his head. "They need to believe they will live to enjoy what they build. The walls must hold. The garrison must be strong. Word must spread that Constantinople is defended, not merely occupied."

Brother Martín clears his throat, his voice softer but carrying weight:

"Your Majesty, the Church is a powerful instrument for such matters. The crusade has been proclaimed. If His Holiness could be persuaded to grant... perhaps not plenary indulgence, but significant spiritual rewards for those who settle in defense of Christendom—not merely fight, but stay—the preaching networks of the mendicant orders could spread word to every parish in Europe."

He hesitates. "There are also the younger sons. Every noble house has them—men of good blood with no inheritance, no prospects. A title in Constantinople is better than nothing in Castile or Aragon or Italy."

Lucia has been listening, her grey-green eyes moving from speaker to speaker. Now she speaks, her voice cutting through:

"You are all thinking like men."

She shifts in her chair, one hand resting on her belly.

"Nobles and merchants do not make decisions alone. They have wives. Mothers. Sisters who whisper in their ears." A thin smile. "If you want settlers, you must make Constantinople a place women will agree to go. Not just walls and soldiers—churches, markets, physicians, society. A noble wife must believe she can raise her children there, attend mass in a proper cathedral, find suitable marriages for her daughters."

She looks at Juan directly.

"Write to the wives. Or better—find women who have already gone and returned safely. Let them speak of what Constantinople offers. A man may dream of titles, but he will not move his family into a war camp."

The council falls silent, considering. Then Don Bernat speaks again:

"There is also the question of where to recruit. Italy is obvious—Venice, Genoa, Florence all have men seeking opportunity, and they know the Eastern trade. But they also have old grievances with the Greeks." He glances at Lucia. "Ferrara, Mantua, the smaller states—fewer grievances, more hunger. And Aragon, of course. King Alfonso could be persuaded to encourage settlement if it serves his interests in the Eastern Mediterranean."

He pauses. "What channels does Your Majesty wish to pursue? Church networks? Merchant guilds? Direct appeals to noble houses? All require different approaches—and different resources."

I was thinking more about just making the opportunity public and let people talk about it themself. But if no one knows about the arrangements and the opportunity, then they will not come.

18 dec 2025

Weighed publicity strategy against targeted recruitment approaches


Lucia nods slowly. "You speak of letting the river find its own course. But first, you must dig the channel."

Don Bernat strokes his chin thoughtfully.

"The opportunity is remarkable. But Your Majesty is correct—if men do not know of it, they cannot act upon it. The question becomes: how do we ensure the news spreads widely and accurately?"

He begins pacing, thinking aloud.

"Rumors spread on their own, but they distort. By the time word of Constantinople reaches a second son in Salamanca, it may have transformed into fantasy or nightmare. We need... a proclamation. Something official. Something that can be copied, read aloud in market squares, posted on church doors."

Brother Martín brightens.

"The Church already has such networks, Your Majesty. When His Holiness proclaimed the crusade, copies went to every bishop, every cathedral chapter, every monastery. The same mechanism could carry word of these settlement terms. A papal letter encouraging faithful Christians to settle in defense of Constantinople—this would reach places royal proclamations never could."

He pauses. "The mendicant orders especially. Franciscans and Dominicans preach in every town and village. If they speak of this opportunity from the pulpit..."

Captain Fernán interjects gruffly:

"Proclamations are well and good, but men believe what they see. When the first settlers return with stories of success—when a landless knight writes home that he now holds a title and a house—that is when others will follow." He shrugs. "The first wave is always the hardest. After that, success breeds success."

Lucia taps her finger against the arm of her chair.

"Then we need both. The proclamation to plant the seed. And the stories to make it grow." She looks at Juan. "Is there anyone already in Constantinople who could write such letters? Someone whose word would be trusted back home? A knight from a known family, a merchant from a respected guild?"

She tilts her head. "And what of those who have already committed? The knights of the Military Orders, the nobles who pledged men—do their families know what they stand to gain? A mother who learns her son may become a duke will speak of nothing else at every gathering she attends."

Don Bernat raises a finger.

"There is also the matter of the Italian merchant republics. Venice and Genoa already have quarters in Constantinople—they know the city, they know the trade. If their merchants begin speaking of new opportunities, new legal protections, favorable terms... word spreads through commercial networks faster than any proclamation."

He hesitates. "But Venice and Genoa are rivals. Favor one too openly and the other grows hostile. Perhaps... perhaps we approach the smaller Italian states first. Ferrara, Mantua, Florence. Let them establish themselves before the great powers realize what they are missing."

The council looks to you. The outlines of a strategy are forming:

Official proclamation — documenting the terms, to be copied and distributed
Church networks — papal endorsement, mendicant preaching
Personal letters — from those already committed, to families back home
Merchant channels — through Italian trading networks
Early success stories — letting the first settlers become recruiters
What approach does Juan wish to prioritize?

There are already Latins living in Constantinople who will move out of the quarters and will expand their business and invest. We can report on developments in the city. Not favor anyone, just the reality of how the investments are panning out. 

But mainly, lets see if we can use the church to distribute the opportunities for christians who are not afraid and want to fight the good fight. And we will adress women as well as men. A proclamation that can be read in every church. And we make it clear that the city is now well-defended and that the defensor will protect them. That there is a risk involved but that a christian will be rewarded for having faith.

18 dec 2025

Orchestrated multi-faceted proclamation strategy leveraging church networks



The council murmurs approval. Brother Martín is already reaching for parchment and quill.

Brother Martín speaks with growing enthusiasm:

"A proclamation through Church channels—this is wise, Your Majesty. The faithful trust what they hear from the pulpit. And if we frame this not merely as opportunity, but as calling..." He pauses, quill hovering. "The crusade already has spiritual weight. Settlement in defense of Christendom becomes an act of faith, not merely commerce."

He begins making notes. "We address both men and women. We speak of families building new lives in a city restored to Christ's service. We acknowledge the risk—honestly, as Your Majesty says—but we frame it as the risk all Christians take when they choose faith over fear."

Lucia leans forward, her expression intent.

"Good. But be specific about what women will find there. Churches where they may worship. Markets where they may buy familiar goods. The promise of law and order—that their homes will be protected, their children safe." She glances at Brother Martín. "Women do not fear risk if they believe their sacrifice has meaning. But they will not follow husbands into chaos."

She pauses. "And speak of the future. Children born in Constantinople will inherit what their parents build. Titles pass to sons and daughters. This is not adventure—it is legacy."

Don Bernat nods thoughtfully.

"The neutral reporting on developments—this is shrewd. No favoritism, no promises that cannot be kept. Simply: here is what is happening. Here is what the Venetian merchant built. Here is what the Aragonese knight received. Let the facts speak." He strokes his chin. "Perhaps quarterly reports? Sent through the same Church channels? Men will wait for news before committing—give them news worth waiting for."

Captain Fernán grunts.

"The defense must be emphasized. Men will ask: what stops the Turk from simply taking everything? The answer must be clear—seven hundred knights of the Military Orders hold the walls. The Hospitallers of Rhodes are committed. The Defensor has bound Castile, Aragón, and Naples to Constantinople's protection." He looks at Juan. "This is not a city waiting to fall. This is a city preparing to grow."

Brother Martín looks up from his notes.

"Your Majesty, shall I draft this proclamation now? We have the key elements:

The opportunity: land, titles, legal protections, trade rights
The defense: Military Orders, the Defensor's commitment, allied kingdoms
The spiritual dimension: service to Christendom, faith over fear
The audience: men and women, families seeking legacy
The honesty: risk acknowledged, but framed as Christian courage
"If we draft it here, Don Bernat can review the political implications, and Her Majesty can ensure we speak properly to women's concerns. Then we seek papal endorsement to distribute through Church networks."

He pauses. "We will need His Holiness's approval for this to be read from pulpits. Will Pope Eugenius support such a proclamation?"

I can send even more military order soldiers to Constantinople. 

Fernan, do you think the military orders can support 2000 soldiers in Constantinople? During the crusades they supplier 4500...

18 dec 2025

Weighed logistical feasibility against historical military order capacity








Captain Fernán furrows his brow, considering the question carefully. He's a royal guard commander, not a Military Order official, but he's fought alongside them for years.

"Your Majesty, I can speak to what I've seen, though the Masters themselves would know their true capacity better than I."

He counts on his fingers.

"During the Granada campaign, the three Orders fielded their full strength—Santiago brought two thousand, Calatrava fifteen hundred, Alcántara one thousand. That was everything they had, and it strained them. Men, horses, supplies—all committed for two years of hard campaigning."

He pauses, thinking.

"Now they've returned to their territories. The crusade service is complete. They're recovering, rebuilding, tending to their estates and commanderies." He shakes his head slowly. "Asking them to maintain two thousand men permanently in Constantinople... that's different from a campaign. A campaign ends. A garrison is forever."

Don Bernat interjects:

"There's also the question of distance. Granada was Castilian territory—supply lines were short, reinforcements close. Constantinople is months away by sea. Every man stationed there must be fed, armed, paid, and rotated eventually. The cost of maintaining a thousand men in Constantinople is perhaps three times what it would cost in Iberia."

Captain Fernán nods and continues:

"Seven hundred are there now under Sotomayor. The Orders could likely sustain twelve to fifteen hundred without breaking themselves—rotating companies, perhaps three hundred men cycling home each year while fresh troops arrive." He meets Juan's eyes. "Two thousand permanently? That would require the Pope's authority to compel it, or significant crown support to offset the cost. The Masters would resist depleting their home garrisons entirely."

He hesitates.

"Unless... Your Majesty intends to change how the Orders operate? The papal decree gave you authority over them. If Constantinople becomes their primary purpose rather than an obligation alongside their Iberian duties..."

The implication hangs in the air. The Military Orders could be transformed from Iberian institutions into Mediterranean crusading forces—but that would be a fundamental change to their identity and purpose.

I will write them to bring their number in Constantinople to 1000. And to establish commanderies there. When I come back to Iberia, I will indeed give them a new mission charter binding them to the Apokatastasis. After Grenada, new lands to reclaim from the infidel. A new holy cause.

18 dec 2025

Orchestrated military expansion and reimagined crusading purpose beyond Iberia




The council absorbs this declaration. There is a weight to it—the sense of a king reshaping institutions that have existed for centuries.

Brother Martín crosses himself, his eyes bright.

"A new holy cause," he repeats softly. "The Reconquista complete, and now the Orders turn eastward. Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara—no longer defenders of a frontier that no longer exists, but swords of Christendom against the greater enemy." He looks at Juan with something approaching awe. "Your Majesty, this is... this is what the Orders were founded for. Before they became landlords and tax collectors. You would restore them to their purpose."

Captain Fernán nods slowly, the practical soldier calculating.

"Two hundred eighty-five more men to bring the garrison to one thousand. That's achievable—a company from each Order, rotated from their Iberian holdings. The commanderies in Constantinople..." He pauses, thinking. "That's clever. Once they have property there, permanent presence, they're invested. It's no longer a distant obligation but their own land to defend."

Don Bernat strokes his chin, his diplomat's mind working through implications.

"King Alfonso will be interested in this development. Aragón has its own Military Orders—the Order of Montesa, small but capable. If Castilian Orders establish themselves in Constantinople, Aragonese knights may wish to follow." He glances at Juan. "This serves the alliance. Iberian military presence in the Eastern Mediterranean, bound by holy oaths rather than merely treaties."

He hesitates. "The Masters, though—they are proud men. They will accept Your Majesty's authority, as the papal decree commands. But how you present this matters. If it seems punishment or exile, they will resist in subtle ways. If it seems honor and holy mission..."

Lucia has been watching Juan with an expression he has come to recognize—the sharp assessment of a political mind.

"You are not merely garrisoning a city," she says quietly. "You are building an institution. The Orders bound to Constantinople become your Orders in a way they never were in Iberia, where they answer to Pope and tradition as much as crown." Her grey-green eyes meet his. "When you write this charter, my love, you are writing the future of Christian power in the East. Choose your words carefully."

She pauses.

"And the Masters should be present when you announce this new mission. Let them stand beside you, not receive letters from afar. They must feel they are partners in this holy cause, not servants receiving commands."

Brother Martín looks up from his notes.

"Shall I draft the letter to the Masters requesting the additional troops, Your Majesty? And perhaps... an outline of the new mission charter, to be refined when you return to Castile?"

Command them to bring the number in the city to 1000 and to start establishing a permanent presence there. Also note that I will discuss their new charter when I return. 

Also, draft the proclamation that is to be spread through the churches. 

GM: Dont draft the letters themselves, We will instead roll for how effective the settlement is going to be. Evaluate and draft a d100 table to see how effective the settlement is going to be for the first 2 years.

18 dec 2025

Weighed success and failure factors to calibrate settlement campaign effectiveness table






SETTLEMENT CAMPAIGN EVALUATION
Initiative: Church-distributed proclamation encouraging Christian settlement in Constantinople, combined with Military Order reinforcement to 1,000 men and establishment of permanent commanderies.

Timeline: First 2 years (July 1434 - July 1436)

SUCCESS FACTORS (persistent advantages)
Church Distribution Networks — Mendicant orders reach every parish in Christendom
Papal Relations — Eugenius IV likely to endorse given existing crusade support
Concrete Terms — Titles, land grants, legal protections already documented in law
Military Credibility — 1,000 Military Order soldiers, plus Hospitallers, provide real security
Juan's Reputation — The Reconquista conqueror's promise of protection carries weight
Granada Precedent — Settlers there prospered; people have seen it work
Honest Framing — Acknowledging risk builds trust; appeals to faith rather than fantasy
Addressing Women — Families recruit better than adventurers alone
Existing Latin Presence — Organic success stories will emerge from current residents
Younger Sons — Genuine demand from men with good blood but no inheritance
FAILURE FACTORS (persistent obstacles)
Distance — Constantinople is months away; the unknown terrifies
Thessalonica Memory — The 1430 sack remains vivid; 7,000 enslaved
Ottoman Encirclement — The city is surrounded by hostile territory
Fourth Crusade Legacy — Greeks distrust Latins; Latins fear Greek resentment
Venetian/Genoese Opposition — Merchant republics may discourage competition
Granada Competition — Why go to Constantinople when Iberia has opportunities?
Economic Uncertainty — Trade improvements are promised, not proven
Military Order Reluctance — Masters may drag feet on permanent Eastern presence
News Vulnerability — Any setback (raid, riot, plague) kills momentum instantly
Papal Delays — Eugenius may endorse slowly or with conditions
D100 TABLE: Settlement Campaign Effectiveness (First 2 Years)
Roll	Result	Description
1-5	Catastrophic Failure	A disaster strikes Constantinople during the campaign—Ottoman raid, major fire, plague outbreak, or violent Greek-Latin riot. News spreads faster than any proclamation. The settlement campaign becomes a warning rather than invitation. Fewer than 50 settlers arrive; some existing residents leave. The Military Orders question their commitment. Recovery will take years of demonstrated stability.
6-15	Significant Failure	The Pope delays endorsement, citing concerns about provoking the Sultan or requiring Greek religious concessions first. Without papal backing, the proclamation reaches only scattered parishes. Venetian and Genoese merchants actively discourage settlement to protect their monopolies. Perhaps 100-200 settlers arrive—mostly desperate men with nothing to lose. Women refuse to go. The Military Orders send only 200 additional men, citing logistical difficulties.
16-25	Poor Results	The proclamation distributes but fails to inspire. Thessalonica's memory proves stronger than promises. A few hundred settlers arrive—mostly younger sons and adventurers, very few families. Italian merchants show no interest. The Military Orders reach 850 men but resist establishing permanent commanderies, preferring rotation. Constantinople gains little; the campaign is not a disaster but clearly disappoints.
26-40	Modest Impact	The campaign produces measurable but limited results. Approximately 400-600 settlers arrive over two years—a mix of knights seeking titles, craftsmen seeking opportunity, and a small number of families. The Military Orders reach 1,000 men and establish minimal commanderies. Italian merchants from smaller states (Ferrara, Mantua) show tentative interest. The Greek population remains wary but not hostile. A foundation exists, but momentum is slow.
41-55	Moderate Success	The proclamation resonates with its target audience. Roughly 800-1,200 settlers arrive—including meaningful numbers of families, particularly from Iberia and the smaller Italian states. The Military Orders establish proper commanderies and begin treating Constantinople as a permanent mission. Trade begins improving as new merchants arrive. Some early success stories circulate back to Europe. The settlement is viable but not yet thriving.
56-70	Strong Results	The honest framing and Church networks prove effective. Approximately 1,500-2,000 settlers arrive, including a healthy proportion of families. Several minor noble houses commit younger sons with retinues. Craftsmen establish workshops; merchants open trading houses. The Military Orders embrace their Eastern mission. Quarterly reports show genuine economic improvement. Word spreads organically—success breeds interest. Constantinople begins feeling alive again.
71-85	Excellent Response	The campaign exceeds expectations. Between 2,500-3,500 settlers arrive—families, knights, merchants, craftsmen. The combination of spiritual calling and concrete opportunity proves powerful. Several Italian banking houses establish branches. The Military Orders compete for honor in Constantinople rather than resisting deployment. Greek residents begin cautiously engaging with Latin newcomers. The city's population grows noticeably; abandoned districts see rehabilitation. Europe takes notice.
86-95	Remarkable Success	The proclamation sparks genuine enthusiasm. Over 4,000 settlers arrive in two years—a transformation visible to anyone who visits. Noble families of middling rank relocate entirely, seeking the titles promised. Merchant guilds establish formal presence. The Military Orders build substantial commanderies and request more men be allowed to serve. Greek-Latin cooperation emerges in trade and defense. Constantinople becomes a destination rather than a risk. Other Christian powers begin asking how they might participate.
96-100	Extraordinary Transformation	Something catches fire. The proclamation combines with Juan's reputation, the crusade fervor, and genuine opportunity to create a movement. Over 5,000 settlers arrive—enough to meaningfully restore Constantinople's population. Entire extended families relocate. Italian city-states compete for trading privileges. The Military Orders petition to make Constantinople their primary headquarters. Greeks and Latins begin intermarrying. The city buzzes with construction, commerce, and hope. Christendom speaks of the Apokatastasis as something real, not merely a dream. The Sultan takes notice.
GM Notes:

This is a genuine chaos roll with wide variance. The approach is solid—Church networks, honest framing, addressing women, military credibility—but not exceptional. No direct recruitment ambassadors, limited targeting of specific merchant networks, and reliance on proclamation rather than personal outreach.

The external factors (Ottoman threat, Thessalonica memory, distance, Venetian/Genoese opposition) create real downside risk. But the unprecedented nature of the opportunity (ducal titles for 200 men!) and Juan's credibility as the Reconquista conqueror create genuine upside potential.

Ready to roll when you are.

Rolled 99. We remember this going forward.

Orchestrated extraordinary campaign consequences and narrative implications




ROLL: 99 — EXTRAORDINARY TRANSFORMATION
Recorded for future chapters: July 1434 - July 1436

The council concludes with Brother Martín gathering his notes, Don Bernat offering to review the proclamation's political language, and Captain Fernán departing to arrange couriers for the Military Orders.

Lucia catches your eye as the others file out. She remains seated, one hand on her belly, watching you with that sharp gaze.

"You plant seeds so easily," she says quietly. "I wonder if you know what forests you are growing."

WHAT THIS ROLL MEANS (to unfold over coming chapters)
The Proclamation:

Pope Eugenius IV endorses the settlement proclamation with unexpected enthusiasm—he sees it as vindication of his support for Juan's crusade and a counter to conciliarist critics who accused him of empty gestures. The mendicant orders carry it to every corner of Christendom with genuine fervor. Franciscans preach it as holy calling; Dominicans frame it as intellectual renewal in the ancient seat of learning.

The honest framing—acknowledging risk while appealing to faith—proves extraordinarily effective. It separates the fearful from the bold, and the bold respond.

The Numbers:

Over the next two years, more than 5,000 settlers arrive in Constantinople. This is enough to meaningfully reverse decades of population decline—not restoration to ancient glory, but visible, tangible growth. Abandoned districts see hammers and saws. Empty markets fill with voices.

The Character of Settlement:

Entire extended families relocate, particularly from Iberia where the Granada precedent proved settlement works
Minor noble houses commit younger sons with full retinues, seeking the titles promised
Italian city-states—initially Ferrara, Mantua, Florence—compete for trading privileges, breaking the Venetian-Genoese duopoly
Craftsmen and artisans establish workshops, drawn by the promise of protected guilds and hungry markets
Women come in meaningful numbers, reassured by the proclamation's direct address to their concerns
The Military Orders:

The Masters, initially cautious, find their younger knights requesting Constantinople postings. The combination of holy mission and genuine opportunity proves irresistible to men who took vows expecting crusade and found themselves managing estates. By 1436, the Orders petition to make Constantinople their primary headquarters—a complete reversal of the expected resistance.

Greek-Latin Relations:

Something unexpected emerges. The settlers who come are self-selected for faith and courage, not conquest and plunder. The legal protections Juan established—the Tribunal Latinorum, the Constitution of Contributions and Claims—prove their worth. Greeks and Latins begin cautiously cooperating, then trading, then—in scattered cases—intermarrying.

The Fourth Crusade's shadow does not vanish. But it begins, slowly, to lift.

Christendom's Perception:

The Apokatastasis transforms from a foreign word in a distant decree to something people talk about. In taverns from Lisbon to Vienna, men discuss Constantinople's revival. The city becomes a symbol—proof that Christendom can build, not merely defend.

The Sultan's Notice:

Murad II receives reports. The city he expected to wither is instead growing. The walls he expected to crumble are manned by Military Order knights. The population he expected to flee is being reinforced.

The cautious Sultan grows more cautious still. But his janissaries grow restless. Idle armies are dangerous, and Constantinople—swelling with Latin settlers and Latin gold—becomes a more tempting prize even as it becomes a harder target.

The meeting at Tenedos, scheduled for spring 1435, takes on new weight.

Current Date: Late July 1434

Lucia's Delivery: Expected late August/September 1434

Council Decisions Implemented:

Letters to Military Order Masters: Increase Constantinople garrison to 1,000, establish permanent commanderies
Settlement proclamation: Drafted for papal endorsement and Church distribution
New mission charter: To be formalized upon return to Castile
What does Juan do for the remainder of the summer while awaiting Lucia's delivery?

That is all I wanted to do. 

Draft a d100 table to see what happend until Lucia delivers. Maybe nothing happens, maybe there is something.

Architected random event table for pregnancy waiting period






CHAOS ROLL: The Waiting Weeks (Late July - September 1434)
Situation: Juan remains in Naples with Lucia, awaiting the birth of their child. Alfonso consolidates his kingdom. Letters have been dispatched. The world turns.

D100 TABLE: Events During the Summer
Roll	Result	Description
1-5	Tragedy Strikes	Something goes terribly wrong with Lucia's pregnancy—complications, illness, or accident. The birth becomes a crisis. Juan faces the possibility of losing his wife, his child, or both. Even if they survive, recovery will be long and the experience scarring. All other matters fade to insignificance.
6-10	Dire News from the East	A messenger arrives from Constantinople bearing alarming news—Ottoman raid on the suburbs, major fire in the Latin quarter, violent Greek-Latin riot, or plague outbreak. The settlement campaign may be compromised before it begins. Juan must decide whether to sail east immediately or trust Sotomayor to handle the crisis.
11-15	Crisis in Castile	Word arrives from Álvaro de Luna. Something has gone wrong at home—noble rebellion brewing, treasury crisis, illness among the royal children, or Portuguese border incident. Juan is pulled between his duty to Lucia and his duty to his kingdom. Difficult choices must be made.
16-20	Alfonso's Troubles	The Calabrian barons who knelt so recently prove false. Rebellion flares in the southern provinces. Alfonso requests Juan's aid—or at least his counsel. Naples is not as secure as it appeared, and Juan's army has already been disbanded.
21-25	Unwelcome Visitor	Someone arrives in Naples who complicates matters—a papal legate with demands, a French envoy protesting René's treatment, a Genoese delegation with grievances, or an Ottoman observer "ensuring" the tribute arrangements. Diplomacy intrudes on Juan's quiet summer.
26-35	Minor Concerns	Small troubles accumulate. A fever passes through the household (not serious, but worrying). A letter goes astray. A servant proves dishonest. Lucia grows irritable in the summer heat. Nothing catastrophic, but the weeks are not entirely peaceful. Juan handles petty problems while waiting for the birth.
36-50	Quiet Waiting	The summer passes without significant incident. Juan spends time with Lucia, corresponds with his officials, perhaps explores Naples or builds his relationship with Alfonso. The world grants him a rare gift: peace. Lucia's pregnancy progresses normally. The only drama is the natural anxiety of awaiting a child.
51-60	Good News Arrives	Positive reports reach Naples. Perhaps the Military Orders respond enthusiastically to their new mission. Perhaps Álvaro writes of continued stability in Castile. Perhaps early word suggests the settlement proclamation is being well-received. The waiting weeks bring encouragement rather than crisis.
61-70	Strengthening Bonds	The quiet weeks prove valuable for relationships. Deep conversations with Lucia strengthen their marriage. Time with Alfonso cements the alliance into genuine friendship. Juan learns more about Naples, its people, its potential role in his grand strategy. The waiting is not wasted—it builds foundations.
71-80	Unexpected Opportunity	Something fortunate emerges from the summer's quiet. A useful contact arrives in Naples—a scholar, a merchant with Eastern connections, a military expert, a diplomat with valuable intelligence. Or perhaps Juan discovers something about Naples itself that serves his larger purposes. Opportunity knocks unbidden.
81-90	Favorable Developments	Multiple pieces of good news arrive. The Military Orders exceed expectations. Early settlement interest proves strong. Alfonso's consolidation proceeds smoothly. A letter from Constantinople reports the city thriving under Sotomayor's command. The summer proves that Juan's plans are working even in his absence.
91-95	Personal Joy	The birth goes exceptionally well. Lucia delivers quickly and safely, recovering with remarkable speed. The child is healthy and strong. Juan experiences genuine happiness uncomplicated by crisis or duty. For a brief, precious moment, he is simply a husband and father, not a king building empires.
96-100	Blessed Summer	Everything aligns. The birth is easy; mother and child thrive. Wonderful news arrives from multiple quarters—Castile stable, Constantinople flourishing, the settlement campaign already generating enthusiasm, the Military Orders embracing their new mission. Alfonso's Naples secure. Even the weather cooperates. Juan enters autumn with his family healthy, his alliances strong, and his plans succeeding beyond expectation. Providence seems to smile.
GM Notes:

This is a pure chaos roll. Juan has made no specific decisions to influence it—he is simply waiting. The table reflects the reality that medieval life was unpredictable: pregnancies were dangerous, news traveled slowly, crises could erupt anywhere.

The weighting is roughly neutral—neither optimistic nor pessimistic. Bad outcomes (1-25) balance against good outcomes (71-100), with the middle range (26-70) representing normal variation from quiet to mildly positive.

The pregnancy itself is the most significant variable. Medieval childbirth was genuinely dangerous, even for queens with the best available care.

Ready to roll when you are.

This check does not include in any way anything related to the pregancy. We make a seperate roll fot that.

21-25	Disturbing Intelligence	Reports reach Juan that concern him—Sultan Murad massing troops, Venetian scheming against the settlement, French preparations to contest Naples again, or troubling news from the Council of Basel. Nothing requiring immediate action, but shadows gather on the horizon.
26-35	Minor Concerns	Small troubles accumulate. A letter goes astray. A servant proves dishonest. Disputes among the remaining Castilian guards require mediation. Petty problems that consume time without threatening anything significant. The weeks pass in mundane frustration.
36-55	Quiet Waiting	The summer passes without significant incident. Juan corresponds with his officials, explores Naples, builds his relationship with Alfonso. The world grants him a rare gift: peace. No news is good news—the silence from Castile, Constantinople, and elsewhere suggests stability.

Perhaps early word suggests the settlement proclamation is being well-received. Encouragement rather than crisis.
66-75	Strengthening Bonds	The quiet weeks prove valuable for relationships. Time with Alfonso cements the alliance into genuine friendship. Juan learns more about Naples, its politics, its potential role in his grand strategy. Perhaps he meets Neapolitan nobles or merchants who prove useful. The waiting builds foundations.
76-85	Unexpected Opportunity	Something fortunate emerges from the summer's quiet. A useful contact arrives in Naples—a scholar, a merchant with Eastern connections, a military expert, a diplomat with valuable intelligence. Or perhaps an opportunity arises that Juan could not have anticipated.
86-95	Favorable Developments	Multiple pieces of good news arrive. The Military Orders exceed expectations. Early settlement interest proves strong. Alfonso's consolidation proceeds smoothly. A letter from Constantinople reports the city thriving under Sotomayor's command. Juan's plans work even in his absence.
96-100	Extraordinary Fortune	Everything aligns beyond expectation. Word arrives of unexpected windfalls—a major noble house committing to Constantinople, a diplomatic breakthrough, an enemy's plans collapsing, or an opportunity Juan never anticipated. Providence opens doors he did not know existed.
Ready to roll when you are. We will roll separately for the pregnancy.

18 dec 2025

Interpreted roll outcome and prepared narrative setup


ROLL: 51 — QUIET WAITING
The summer passes in languid stillness.

Naples bakes under the August sun. Juan finds himself in an unfamiliar situation—a king with nothing urgent to do. Letters have been sent; responses will take weeks to arrive. The army has disbanded and sailed home. Alfonso is consumed with the business of claiming his inheritance, meeting with Calabrian lords, reorganizing the administration Queen Joanna neglected in her final years.

Juan corresponds with his officials. A letter to Álvaro confirming the Naples resolution and the Ottoman envoy's visit. A letter to Don García López de Padilla in Granada, inquiring about the administration. A letter to Fray Hernando in Basel, asking about the Council's mood.

The replies, when they come, are reassuring in their mundanity. Castile is stable. Granada is quiet. The Council debates endlessly but has not erupted into schism. The world turns without requiring Juan's immediate attention.

He explores Naples—the great Castel Nuovo, the crowded harbor, the ancient churches. He dines with Alfonso when the King of Aragón can spare an evening from his duties. They speak of strategy, of family, of the future they are building together.

Mostly, he waits.

Lucia grows larger and more uncomfortable as the weeks pass. She complains about the heat, about the food, about the inadequacy of Neapolitan physicians compared to those she might have had in Ferrara or Toledo. Juan has learned that these complaints are how she manages fear—by focusing on irritations she can name rather than dangers she cannot control.

The silence from the wider world is, in its way, a blessing. No news is good news. The crises that might have been—Ottoman aggression, Castilian rebellion, Neapolitan treachery—do not materialize.

September arrives. The heat begins to break.

And Lucia's time draws near.

PREGNANCY ROLL
Situation: Lucia d'Este, age 24, delivers her first child in Naples. She has access to the best physicians available—Italian-trained doctors from Salerno, experienced midwives, the resources of a royal household. But childbirth in 1434 remains dangerous regardless of status or care.

Shall I draft a d100 table for the delivery, or do you have a preferred approach?

Yes, lets make a d100 table to see how her delivery will go. Exclude anything related to the child itself sucj as any condition or gender.

Weighed medieval childbirth outcomes and complications for wealthy expectant mother





CHAOS ROLL: Lucia's Delivery (September 1434)
Situation: Lucia d'Este, age 24, first pregnancy. She has access to Salerno-trained physicians, experienced midwives, and the resources of a royal household in Naples. She has had two months to rest after the sea voyage from Constantinople. The summer heat has broken.

Factors:

Age 24: Optimal childbearing years
First delivery: Typically more difficult than subsequent births
Excellent medical care: Best available in Christendom
Good rest: Two months settled in Naples
Prior travel stress: Long sea voyage during pregnancy, now recovered
General health: No recorded illness or complications during pregnancy
D100 TABLE: Lucia's Delivery
Roll	Result	Description
1-3	Catastrophic	The delivery goes terribly wrong. Despite the physicians' best efforts, Lucia suffers complications beyond their skill to address—catastrophic bleeding, fever that sets in immediately, or physical trauma. Juan faces the very real possibility of losing his wife. If she survives, recovery will be measured in months, and future pregnancies may be impossible.
4-8	Severe Complications	The labor is prolonged and brutal—more than a day of agony. Lucia survives, but barely. Severe bleeding or internal damage leaves her bedridden for weeks. The physicians speak carefully about "rest" and "time," but their eyes tell a darker story. Recovery will take months; her health may never fully return. Future pregnancies carry grave risk.
9-15	Difficult Delivery	A hard labor lasting many hours. The physicians must intervene in ways that leave Lucia exhausted and weakened. She loses significant blood and develops a mild fever in the days following. Full recovery takes six to eight weeks. The experience is traumatic; she will not speak of it willingly. Future pregnancies are possible but should be approached with caution.
16-25	Complicated but Successful	The delivery presents challenges—the labor is long, the pain severe, and there are moments when the physicians exchange worried glances. But their skill proves sufficient. Lucia emerges exhausted and shaken, requiring four to six weeks of recovery. She will carry the memory of this difficulty, but her health is not permanently compromised.
26-40	Hard but Normal	A difficult first delivery, as many are. The labor lasts through the night and into the morning. Lucia endures considerable pain and emerges drained. But the physicians assure Juan this is within normal bounds for a first birth. Recovery takes three to four weeks. She will be tired and sore, but there are no lasting concerns.
41-60	Normal Delivery	The birth proceeds as births do—painful, frightening, exhausting, but ultimately successful. The labor lasts eight to twelve hours. Lucia curses in Italian, grips the midwife's hand until her knuckles whiten, and endures. Recovery takes two to three weeks. The physicians are satisfied; there are no complications worth noting. A routine delivery, insofar as any delivery is routine.
61-75	Smooth Delivery	The labor progresses well. The physicians note approvingly that Lucia's body seems well-suited to childbirth. The worst is over within six to eight hours. She is tired but not destroyed by the experience. Recovery takes perhaps two weeks. Lucia jokes weakly afterward that Italian women are made of stronger stuff than Castilian physicians expected.
76-85	Easy Delivery	Remarkably straightforward for a first birth. The labor is measured in hours, not days. Lucia's pain is significant but manageable; she remains lucid throughout. The physicians have little to do but catch. Recovery is swift—within ten days she is walking, within two weeks she feels nearly herself. The midwives call it a blessing.
86-95	Swift and Sure	The delivery is almost suspiciously easy. Labor begins and within four to five hours, it is done. Lucia is astonished at how quickly it passed. The physicians exchange pleased glances—this is the kind of birth they wish all noble ladies experienced. Recovery takes barely a week. Lucia regains her sharp tongue almost immediately, which Juan takes as the surest sign of her health.
96-100	Blessed Birth	Everything aligns perfectly. The labor is short, the pain manageable, the delivery uncomplicated. Lucia emerges tired but radiant, recovering her strength within days. The physicians speak of it as one of the easiest noble births they have attended. The midwives whisper that God's favor rests on this house. Within a week, Lucia is holding court from her chambers, complaining about the food and demanding better wine—utterly herself.

Interpreted delivery outcome and prepared for next narrative phase



ROLL: 44 — NORMAL DELIVERY
The pains begin in the small hours of the morning, September 14th.

Juan is woken by a servant's urgent knock—the Queen's waters have broken. He rises to find the Palazzo Caracciolo already stirring, candles lit in windows, midwives hurrying through corridors. The Salerno physicians have been summoned; they arrive within the hour, grave-faced men carrying leather bags of instruments Juan does not wish to examine.

He is not permitted in the birthing chamber. This is women's work, the midwives tell him firmly. He may wait in the antechamber. He may pray. He may pace. But he may not interfere.

So Juan waits.

The hours pass with agonizing slowness. He hears Lucia's cries through the heavy door—at first controlled, then ragged, then sounds he has never heard a human make. He paces. He prays. He sends servants for updates and receives only "proceeding normally" and "these things take time."

Dawn comes. The cries continue.

Captain Fernán appears at some point, says something about standing watch, positions himself by the door. Juan barely registers his presence. Brother Martín arrives to pray with him; the Latin words wash over Juan without meaning.

Mid-morning. The cries grow worse, then suddenly stop.

Juan's heart freezes.

Then—a different sound. Thin, warbling, unmistakable.

A baby's cry.

The chief physician emerges an hour later, wiping his hands on a cloth. His expression is tired but satisfied.

"Your Majesty. The Queen has delivered successfully. A difficult labor, but within normal bounds for a first birth. She is exhausted and will require rest—two to three weeks before she should be moved, longer before she regains her full strength."

He pauses.

"She is asking for you."

Juan finds Lucia propped against pillows, her dark hair plastered to her forehead with sweat, her grey-green eyes shadowed with exhaustion. She looks like she has fought a battle—because she has.

But she is alive. She is whole. And in her arms...

She looks up as he enters. A weak smile crosses her face.

"Well," she says, her voice hoarse. "That was unpleasant. I hope you appreciate what I endure for this dynasty of yours."

The child's gender and health remain to be determined.

Shall I draft a table for the child, or do you wish to roll separately for gender and health?

Lucia! How are you love?

18 dec 2025

Orchestrated character response revealing newborn daughter's arrival





Lucia shifts against the pillows, wincing slightly at the movement. The exhaustion is written in every line of her face—dark circles under her eyes, pallor beneath her olive complexion, trembling in her hands. But those grey-green eyes, when they meet yours, still carry their familiar sharpness.

"How am I?" She laughs weakly, then grimaces. "I feel as though a horse trampled me from the inside. The physicians assure me this is normal. I have doubts about their definition of normal."

She adjusts the small bundle in her arms, and for the first time you see the face of your child clearly. Tiny, red, wrinkled—as all newborns are—with a wisp of dark hair and eyes squeezed shut against the unfamiliar world.

"A daughter," Lucia says softly. "I hope you are not disappointed. I know kings prefer sons."

She looks down at the infant, and something in her expression shifts—a tenderness you have not seen before, cutting through the exhaustion and the sharp wit.

"She came into this world screaming her displeasure. The midwives say that is a good sign—strong lungs, strong will." A ghost of a smile. "I suspect she will be trouble. She is already very demanding about when she wishes to eat."

Lucia looks up at you, suddenly vulnerable beneath the bravado.

"Have you thought of a name?"

I was thinking of an Italian name. She is born of an Italian mother in Italy. What are you thinking of?

18 dec 2025

Deliberated Italian naming traditions honoring maternal heritage and family significance





Lucia's eyebrows rise slightly—a flicker of surprise, then something softer. Gratitude, perhaps, that he would offer this.

"An Italian name," she repeats quietly. She looks down at the infant, considering.

"My mother was Costanza. She died when I was young—I barely remember her face, only her voice singing to me." She pauses. "But perhaps that is too melancholy a legacy to burden a child with."

She shifts the baby gently, thinking.

"There is Beatrice—a good Ferrarese name. The poets have made it immortal through Dante. And there was a Beatrice d'Este who was Duchess of Milan, a woman of some renown." A faint smile. "Though the Visconti might take it as a pointed reminder of Este claims."

She considers further.

"Bianca is simple and beautiful. Eleonora has strength to it—there have been queens by that name. Francesca..." She wrinkles her nose. "Too common."

Lucia looks up at you, her exhaustion momentarily forgotten in the contemplation.

"What sounds right to you, when you look at her? Beatrice? Costanza? Eleonora?" She glances down at the tiny face. "Or perhaps she will tell us herself, when she opens her eyes and shows us who she is."

The baby stirs, makes a small sound of complaint, and settles again.

"She has opinions already," Lucia murmurs. "Definitely trouble."

Welcome to the world Bianca of Castille. You are a wonder of God. And we love you very much. 

I take Catalina and show her her baby sister.

18 dec 2025

Contextualized toddler's emotional journey through family expansion




Lucia watches as you move toward the door, a soft smile on her exhausted face.

You find Catalina in the adjoining chamber with Doña Beatriz, the Portuguese lady-in-waiting who has cared for her since Isabel's death. The little girl is playing with wooden blocks, stacking them into precarious towers and knocking them down with delighted shrieks.

She looks up as you enter, and her face transforms.

"Papa!"

She abandons the blocks and runs to you on unsteady legs, arms raised. At two years and eight months, she is all wild dark curls and bright eyes—Isabel's eyes, you realize with a familiar pang. She has grown so much in the months of travel. Constantinople, Rhodes, Naples—she has seen more of the world than most adults, though she will remember little of it.

You lift her, and she wraps her small arms around your neck.

"Papa, I builded a castle," she informs you seriously. "It falled down."

"I saw," you tell her. "It was a very good castle."

"Where is Mama?" she asks—meaning Lucia, the only mother she truly remembers now.

"Mama is resting. She worked very hard today. But she wants to see you." You carry her toward the birthing chamber. "Catalina, do you remember what we talked about? About the baby in Mama's belly?"

She nods solemnly, though it's unclear how much she understood.

"The baby came out today. You have a little sister now."

Catalina frowns, processing this information. "A sister?"

"Yes. Her name is Bianca. Would you like to meet her?"

You carry Catalina into the chamber. Lucia looks up, her exhaustion momentarily brightened by the sight of her stepdaughter.

"Catalina, tesoro," she says softly. "Come see."

You bring Catalina close to the bed. She peers at the bundle in Lucia's arms with deep suspicion, as only a toddler can.

"It's small," she pronounces finally.

"She is small," Lucia agrees. "She just arrived. She will grow bigger."

Catalina leans closer, studying the wrinkled red face with intense scrutiny. Bianca's eyes flutter open briefly—unfocused, newborn-dark—then close again.

"Why is she all red?"

"Babies are red when they're new. You were red too, when you were born."

"No I wasn't," Catalina says with absolute certainty.

Lucia catches your eye, suppressing a smile despite her exhaustion.

Catalina reaches out a tentative finger toward Bianca's face. Lucia gently redirects her hand to touch the baby's tiny fist instead. Bianca's fingers curl reflexively around Catalina's fingertip.

Catalina's eyes go wide.

"She grabbed me!"

"She likes you," Lucia says. "She knows you're her big sister."

Catalina considers this for a long moment, her expression shifting through several emotions too complex for her years. Then she looks up at you with profound seriousness.

"I will teach her about castles," she announces. "When she's bigger."

I take time to let Lucia recover and then we travel without haste back to Toledo. Travelling with a newborn is difficult so we wait a few months for both mom and baby to recover, then we leave. 

Draft a d100 table to see how the journey goes.

18 dec 2025

Architected journey logistics and devised encounter table framework






CHAOS ROLL: Journey from Naples to Toledo (Late 1434 - Early 1435)
Situation: Juan, Lucia (recovering from childbirth), baby Bianca (2-3 months old at departure), Catalina (nearly 3 years old), and household travel from Naples to Toledo. The journey involves sea voyage to a Spanish port, then overland travel to Toledo. Winter travel carries additional risks, but the pace is deliberately slow and cautious.

Factors:

Newborn infant: Vulnerable to cold, illness, the rigors of travel
Recovering mother: Lucia has had two months to recover; should be capable of travel but not fully robust
Toddler: Catalina is energetic but manageable
Season: Late autumn/winter—rougher seas, colder overland travel
Resources: Royal household with full support, best available accommodations
Pace: Deliberately slow, prioritizing safety over speed
Route: Likely Naples → sea to Valencia or Barcelona → overland to Toledo
D100 TABLE: The Journey Home
Roll	Result	Description
1-5	Disaster at Sea	A winter storm catches the fleet. Ships are separated, damaged, or worse. The royal family endures terrifying hours or days of crisis. Even if all survive, the experience is traumatic—loss of baggage, servants, or escort possible. The journey must be halted for extensive recovery. Lucia's health may suffer a setback; the infant's survival becomes a matter of desperate prayer.
6-10	Serious Illness	Sickness strikes the traveling party—fever, flux, or winter ailment. Bianca, Lucia, or Catalina falls dangerously ill, forcing an extended halt at whatever port or town they've reached. Weeks of anxious waiting while physicians do what they can. Recovery is eventual but the journey is delayed by a month or more, and the experience leaves scars.
11-15	Rough Passage	The sea crossing is brutal—winter storms, high waves, days of seasickness. No one is in danger of death, but the experience is miserable. Lucia's recovery suffers a setback; Bianca cries constantly; Catalina is terrified. By the time they reach Spain, the family needs extended rest before continuing overland. The journey takes much longer than planned.
16-25	Difficult Journey	Multiple problems accumulate—bad weather, minor illnesses, poor roads, inadequate lodgings in places. Nothing catastrophic, but the journey is exhausting and unpleasant. Lucia grows short-tempered; the children are fussy; Juan spends much of the trip managing small crises. They arrive in Toledo worn and weary, grateful to be home.
26-40	Challenging but Manageable	The journey has its difficulties, as winter travel always does. Some rough days at sea, some cold nights on the road, some moments of worry when Bianca develops a cough or Catalina refuses to eat. But the slow pace and good resources see them through. They arrive tired but healthy, the journey a trial but not a trauma.
41-60	Uneventful Journey	The journey proceeds as well as winter travel can. The sea crossing has some rough patches but nothing dangerous. The overland route is cold but passable. The children handle travel better than expected. Lucia recovers her strength gradually along the way. They arrive in Toledo in reasonable condition, glad to be home but none the worse for the experience.
61-75	Smooth Passage	Fortune favors them. The weather holds better than expected for the season; the sea crossing is calm; the roads are passable. Good lodgings are found at each stop. Bianca sleeps through much of the journey; Catalina treats it as an adventure. Lucia arrives in Toledo feeling stronger than when she left Naples. A journey that could have been difficult proves pleasant.
76-85	Pleasant Journey	Everything aligns well. Mild weather, calm seas, comfortable accommodations. The slow pace becomes almost leisurely—time for Juan and Lucia to talk, for Catalina to explore new places, for the family to simply be together without crisis or duty. They arrive in Toledo rested and content, the journey a happy memory rather than an ordeal.
86-95	Excellent Passage	The journey becomes a gift. Perfect weather for the season, smooth sailing, warm welcomes at every port and town. Bianca thrives; Catalina charms everyone she meets; Lucia blossoms back to full health. The family bonds during the long days of travel. They arrive in Toledo in better condition than they left Naples—healthy, happy, and united.
96-100	Blessed Homecoming	Providence smiles on the journey. Extraordinary weather, calm seas, joyful receptions. Word of Juan's return precedes them; crowds gather to see the king who conquered Granada and saved Constantinople. Bianca is healthy and beautiful; Catalina waves at the cheering people; Lucia rides into Toledo radiant and proud. The journey becomes a triumphal procession, a homecoming fit for legend.
Ready to roll when you are.

You not only include the encounter, but also the outcome. That is not what I want. If for example the result is fever, then we stop there and role play what happens next. Juan will take measures and we make new rolls. Same with storms and other difficulties. Redraft the table.

D100 TABLE: The Journey Home
Roll	Result	Description
1-5	Storm at Sea	A serious winter storm catches the fleet mid-crossing. The ships are in danger.
6-10	Illness Strikes	Someone in the royal family develops a fever or serious ailment during the journey. Roll or choose who: 1-2 Bianca, 3-4 Lucia, 5-6 Catalina.
11-15	Ship Trouble	The vessel develops a serious problem—damage to hull, rigging, or rudder. The captain must make a decision about whether to press on or seek the nearest port.
16-20	Banditry	The overland portion of the journey is threatened by bandits or lawless men who see a wealthy caravan. The escort must respond.
21-25	Political Complication	At one of the ports or towns along the route, Juan encounters an unexpected political situation requiring his attention—a dispute, a petitioner, a local lord with grievances or requests.
26-35	Minor Illness	One of the children develops a cough, fever, or ailment that is likely minor but causes concern. The journey may need to slow or halt while it is assessed.
36-45	Weather Delays	Bad weather—storms, heavy rain, impassable roads—forces the party to halt and wait. Time passes, but no immediate danger.
46-60	Uneventful Journey	The journey proceeds without significant incident. Winter travel is never comfortable, but nothing occurs requiring special attention.
61-70	Smooth Passage	The weather holds better than expected. The journey proceeds ahead of schedule with no difficulties worth noting.

Synthesized random rolls into minor health scenario



RESULT: Catalina — Cough and Congestion — Very Mild
The journey has progressed well thus far. The sea crossing from Naples to Valencia passed without incident, and the royal party has been traveling overland through Castile for several days. The winter air is crisp but not bitter; the roads are passable.

It is Doña Beatriz who notices first.

"Your Majesty," she says quietly, approaching Juan during a rest stop at a roadside inn. "Catalina has developed a cough. It started this morning—I thought it was just the cold air, but it has persisted."

She hastens to add: "It does not seem serious. She is eating well, playing normally, no fever that I can detect. But with the infant and the Queen..."

She leaves the implication unspoken. A minor cough in a healthy toddler is nothing. But coughs spread. Bianca is only three months old. Lucia is still regaining her strength.

You find Catalina in the inn's common room, playing with a wooden horse one of the soldiers carved for her. She looks up at your approach, smiles, and then coughs—a small, wet sound, followed by a sniffle.

"Papa, look," she says, holding up the horse. "It's a fast horse. Like yours."

She seems entirely herself—bright-eyed, energetic, unbothered by the cough that punctuates her chatter.

The party is perhaps five or six days from Toledo.

What does Juan do?

Hi Catalina! Love. For a few days you will stay with papa and we play a game that we must stay away from the baby and mama. When they come close we must run away ok? Shall we play?

18 dec 2025

Orchestrated compassionate quarantine framed as playful bonding activity



Catalina's eyes light up at the word "game."

"A running away game?" She bounces on her heels, the wooden horse momentarily forgotten. "I'm good at running!"

She coughs again—a small, rattling thing—then continues without pause: "But why we run from Mama and baby?"

She frowns, working through the logic with the intensity only a toddler can muster.

"Is it like hide and seek? Do they try to find us?" A gasp of excitement. "Do we hide?"

She is already looking around the inn's common room for suitable hiding spots, her imagination racing ahead of any explanation you might offer.

Doña Beatriz watches from nearby, a soft smile on her weathered face. She understands what Juan is doing, even if Catalina does not.

"I can have Catalina's things moved to the adjoining chamber, Your Majesty," she says quietly. "She can travel in the second carriage with myself and the guards. I will keep her entertained."

She pauses.

"Shall I inform the Queen? She will worry if Catalina suddenly avoids her without explanation."

Catalina tugs at your sleeve, coughing once more.

"Papa. Papa. Can the horse play too?" She holds up the wooden carving. "He wants to run away also."

I stay with Catalina the coming days and play to be her horse. Then we walk together to Lucia and run away the moment she moven a bit closer to us.

18 dec 2025

Orchestrated domestic scene with playful parenting and illness prevention




The days that follow are unlike any Juan has experienced as king.

He gets down on hands and knees on the cold floor of roadside inns while Catalina clambers onto his back, shrieking with delight. "Faster, horse! Faster!" He trots around common rooms while servants stare and guards suppress smiles. The King of Castile, Defensor Romaniae, conqueror of Granada—reduced to a child's steed, complete with neighing sounds that make Catalina dissolve into giggles.

The cough persists, but does not worsen. Catalina seems untroubled by it, too absorbed in the wonderful new game Papa has invented.

Each evening, they approach Lucia's chamber.

"Ready?" Juan whispers.

Catalina nods solemnly, suppressing a grin.

They peek around the doorframe. Lucia sits in a chair by the fire, Bianca in her arms. She looks up, sees them, and her face softens with understanding.

"Oh, there you are," she says, rising slowly. "I've been looking for you two—"

"RUN!" Catalina screams, and they flee down the corridor, her laughter echoing off the stone walls. Juan scoops her up and gallops away, her small arms wrapped around his neck, coughing and giggling simultaneously.

Behind them, he hears Lucia's voice, warm with amusement: "I'll catch you eventually!"

On the third evening, Lucia catches Juan's eye from across the room while Catalina is distracted with her wooden horse. She mouths silently: Thank you.

She understands. The game that keeps her daughter happy is also the game that keeps Bianca safe.

By the fifth day, the cough has faded to an occasional sniffle.

Shall I roll to confirm the illness passes without spreading, or do you wish to proceed to the arrival in Toledo?

Lets assume it all goes well from now on. We arrive in Toledo and we immediately meet fernando. Our family finally united.

18 dec 2025

Reconstructed family timeline and envisioned emotional reunion scene








TOLEDO — EARLY 1435
The towers of the Alcázar rise against a pale winter sky as the royal procession approaches the city gates. Word has traveled ahead—crowds line the streets despite the cold, cheering for the king who left to save Constantinople and returns with a new queen and a new princess.

But Juan's thoughts are not on the crowds.

Álvaro de Luna waits in the great courtyard, his weathered face breaking into a rare smile as Juan dismounts. Behind him stands the household staff, the guards, the officials who have kept Castile running in his absence.

And there, held in the arms of a wet nurse, is Fernando.

Juan's son. Fourteen months old now. Born the day Isabel died—the son Juan has seen only once, at his baptism, when the boy was barely two months old.

Fernando has grown. He is no longer the tiny, swaddled bundle Juan remembers. He has dark hair like his mother, and her eyes—Isabel's eyes, the same eyes Catalina carries. He looks at Juan with the open curiosity of a child encountering a stranger.

Because that is what Juan is to him. A stranger.

Lucia hangs back, Bianca in her arms, understanding without being told that this moment belongs to Juan and his firstborn son. Catalina tugs at Juan's hand.

"Papa, who is that baby?"

"That is your brother, mija. Fernando. Do you remember? I told you about him."

Catalina studies the boy with the same suspicious scrutiny she applied to Bianca. "He's bigger than Bianca."

"He is older. He has been waiting here for us to come home."

Juan approaches the wet nurse and she curtsies, offering Fernando to him. The boy looks uncertain, glancing back at the only caregivers he has known. His lower lip trembles.

Juan takes his son in his arms for only the second time.

Fernando stares at him—this large stranger with the tired eyes and the travel-worn clothes. For a long moment, neither moves.

Then Fernando reaches out a small hand and touches Juan's beard, fascinated by the texture.

"Papa," Catalina announces helpfully, pointing at Juan. "That's Papa. He's nice. He's a good horse."

Fernando blinks, processing this information. His hand remains tangled in Juan's beard.

Lucia steps forward now, Bianca stirring in her arms.

"Fernando," she says softly, her Italian accent wrapping around the Spanish name. "I am Lucia. I am..." She glances at Juan. "I am going to help take care of you."

She does not say mother. She will not claim that title uninvited. But her eyes are gentle as she looks at the boy who will never know the woman who died bringing him into the world.

The four of them stand together in the courtyard of the Alcázar—Juan holding Fernando, Lucia holding Bianca, Catalina clinging to Juan's leg.

A family.

Broken and remade. Marked by loss. But together at last.

Álvaro clears his throat softly.

"Your Majesty. Welcome home. There is much to discuss, when you are ready. But it can wait." His eyes move across the family tableau, and something like warmth flickers in his usually guarded expression. "It can wait."

Hi Alvaro. 

Lets have council tomorrow. 

We use today to get settled in and have a meal together for the first time. I make sure we have crostata.

18 dec 2025

Orchestrated intimate family scene before administrative duties commence



Álvaro bows, and there is something in his eyes—relief, perhaps, or simply the satisfaction of seeing his king home safe with a family intact.

"Tomorrow, Your Majesty. I will have everything prepared."

He withdraws, taking the business of the kingdom with him. For one evening, Castile can wait.

THE FIRST MEAL
The private dining chamber in the Alcázar has been prepared hastily—servants scrambling to accommodate a family that did not exist when Juan left for Constantinople. A fire roars in the hearth against the January chill. Candles cast warm light across the table.

The crostata arrives as requested—a proper Italian crostata di marmellata, the pastry latticed over quince jam. The cook has done his best with an unfamiliar recipe, working from hurried instructions. It is not perfect. But when it is set before Lucia, her eyes widen.

"You remembered," she says softly.

"You complained about Neapolitan pastries for three months. I paid attention."

She laughs—the first real laugh he has heard from her since the birth. "I complained about everything for three months. The heat. The food. The physicians. You." She takes a bite of the crostata and closes her eyes. "This is... acceptable. The cook needs practice. But acceptable."

From her, this is high praise.

Catalina sits in a chair piled with cushions to bring her to table height, attacking her portion of roast chicken with more enthusiasm than technique. Fernando, in a nurse's lap nearby, watches the proceedings with wide eyes, gnawing on a piece of soft bread.

Bianca sleeps in a cradle by the fire, oblivious to it all.

"Catalina," Lucia says, "use your knife, not your fingers."

"But fingers are faster."

"Ladies do not—" Lucia stops herself, glancing at Juan with a wry expression. "I sound like my aunt. God help me."

The meal is chaos. Catalina chatters endlessly about the journey, about her horse game with Papa, about the wooden horse the soldier made her. Fernando drops his bread and wails until it is retrieved. Bianca wakes and demands feeding, and Lucia excuses herself briefly to the wet nurse.

It is loud and messy and utterly without the dignity befitting a royal household.

Juan cannot remember the last time he felt this content.

Later, when the children have been taken to their beds and the servants have cleared the table, Juan and Lucia sit alone by the fire. She holds a cup of wine—her first since before the pregnancy—and stares into the flames.

"Toledo is colder than I expected," she says.

"You will grow accustomed to it."

"Mm." She sips her wine. "The Alcázar is impressive. Older than anything in Ferrara. I can feel the history in the stones." A pause. "I can feel Isabel in the stones, too."

Juan says nothing.

"Her portrait hangs in the gallery. I saw it when we entered." Lucia's voice is careful, neutral. "She was beautiful. More beautiful than I expected."

"Yes."

"Catalina has her eyes."

"Yes."

Lucia is quiet for a long moment. Then she reaches over and takes Juan's hand.

"I am not her," she says simply. "I will not try to be. But I will love her children as my own, and I will build something new in this place." She squeezes his fingers. "That is what I can offer."

Juan raises her hand to his lips.

"That is enough."

The next morning, Juan meets with Álvaro for council.

What matters does Juan wish to address?

GM: Note that Isabel was not beautiful but rather plain (we rolled for this) and that Lucia is extraordinarily beautiful (as we rolled for this). But Isabel was very devout where Lucia is more worldly. 
GM: Remember to never generate dialogue or action for Juan. Instead, just stop. 

I summon my full council the next moring

18 dec 2025

Acknowledged character corrections and prepared council scene setup







GM Note: Correction acknowledged. Isabel was plain in appearance; Lucia is the legendary beauty. Isabel's virtues were her devout faith and gentle nature, not her looks. I'll adjust accordingly.

THE COUNCIL CHAMBER — MORNING
The council gathers in the great chamber of the Alcázar. Winter light streams through tall windows, illuminating the faces of the men who have governed Castile in Juan's absence.

Present:

Álvaro de Luna — Royal Constable, the man who has held the kingdom together through two years of Juan's travels. He looks tired but alert, a stack of documents before him.

Diego de Daza — Chief administrator of the financial reforms. His ledgers are organized with meticulous precision.

Don Íñigo López de Mendoza — Head of House Mendoza, founder of the Council of Great Houses. The poet-diplomat carries himself with quiet authority.

Sir Thomas Beaumont — English knight, now leading the Royal Military Academy. He sits slightly apart, the foreigner among Castilians.

Archbishop Juan de Cerezuela — Archbishop of Toledo, Primate of Spain, and Álvaro's half-brother. He represents the Church's interests at court.

Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles — Commander of the royal guard, present for matters of security.

They rise as Juan enters and remain standing until he takes his seat at the head of the table.

Álvaro speaks first, as is his role: "Your Majesty. It is good to have you home. The kingdom has been stable in your absence, but there is much to report—and much that requires your decision."

He glances at the other councilors, then back to Juan.

"Where would you like to begin?"

Lets begin with the treasury. I have commanded the assembly of an army and 15000 assembled in Palermo. Using noble levies, but I suspect there have been expenses to transport them there and to supply them. King Alfonso has been generous wityh his supply in goods for my army but still. How was it to organize this army and can we now review the total cost of this operation?

18 dec 2025

Reconstructed military logistics and identified treasury expense categories







Diego de Daza straightens in his chair, pulling a ledger from his stack. His methodical nature is evident in the way he organizes his papers before speaking.

"Your Majesty, the Naples expedition was... unprecedented in its logistical demands. Allow me to present the accounting as we have it."

He traces a finger down his columns.

"The assembly itself proceeded smoothly—Don Íñigo can speak to the military aspects. But from the treasury's perspective, the costs were substantial."

Transport Costs: "Fifteen thousand men required transport from Castile to Palermo. We chartered Aragonese and Genoese vessels—King Alfonso assisted with some ships, but the bulk of the cost fell to us. Ship hire, provisioning for the voyage, replacement of horses lost at sea..."

Supply and Provisions: "King Alfonso was indeed generous with supply once the army reached Sicily and Naples. But the initial provisioning—food, fodder, ammunition, medical supplies—was borne by the crown. An army of that size consumes enormously."

Noble Levies: "The levies served without direct pay, as is their feudal obligation for campaign service. However, we compensated losses—horses, equipment, men-at-arms who fell. The battle at Aversa was decisive but not without cost."

He looks up from his ledger.

"In total, Your Majesty, the Naples expedition cost the crown approximately..."

He pauses, waiting for Juan's attention.

"Forty-two thousand florins. This does not include the forty thousand previously sent to King Alfonso for the Sforza contract."

Álvaro interjects quietly: "Eighty-two thousand florins total committed to securing Naples for Aragón."

Diego nods. "The treasury remains healthy, Your Majesty. But it is a significant expenditure. Shall I detail the current balances?"

We live in the year of our lord 1434. Were there any other one-time expenses of note in this year so far?

18 dec 2025

Catalogued various 1434 expenditures and sought clarification on foreign commitments






Diego de Daza flips back several pages in his ledger, his brow furrowed in concentration.

"The year 1434 has been... extraordinarily active, Your Majesty. Beyond the Naples expedition, there were several significant disbursements."

He begins listing:

Constantinople Commitments: "The sixty thousand florins pledged for the wall repairs and the joint treasury with the Byzantine Empire. This was transferred before Your Majesty departed Constantinople."

Rhodes: "Two thousand florins granted to the Knights of Saint John for the purchase of properties in Constantinople."

La Dote de la Reina Isabel: "The perpetual endowment continues to disburse annually—this year approximately three hundred florins in dowries were distributed on the third of August, as established."

He hesitates, glancing at Álvaro.

"There may be expenses Your Majesty committed abroad that have not yet reached our records. The Military Orders, for instance—we received instructions to increase the Constantinople garrison to one thousand men and establish permanent commanderies. The Masters have written asking about crown support for this expansion."

Álvaro adds: "The Royal Military Academy also continues its operations—Sir Thomas can speak to those costs if needed."

Diego looks up from his ledger.

"Your Majesty, if there are other commitments made during your travels that I should account for, I would be grateful to know them now, so the treasury records remain accurate."

The orders have their own income and revenue streams and will pay for the expansion themselves. IIf they need support, they can petition the emperor who has a treasury large enough to accomodate them. He will not fall short. 

The other expenses have already been paid no? The dote de la reina Isabel has been paid as one lump sum if I am not mistaken. The 2000 for the knights of rhodes will likewise be paid from the treasury in Constantinople. 

As far as I can tell, the only real one time expense we have is the campain in Naples and the journey to Constantinople. But we have ships of our own so we only would have to pay for supplies and the normal wages for the crew.

18 dec 2025

Reconciled expense categories and clarified actual crown treasury obligations










Diego de Daza pauses, then nods slowly, a flush of embarrassment creeping up his neck.

"Your Majesty is correct. I apologize for the confusion."

He flips through his ledger, making notations.

"La Dote de la Reina Isabel—yes, the twenty-five thousand florins was established as a perpetual endowment. The annual disbursements come from the endowment's own returns, not from crown funds. I misspoke."

He strikes a line through something in his records.

"And the Constantinople expenditures—the sixty thousand for the walls, the two thousand for Rhodes—these were drawn from the crusade treasury, which Your Majesty transferred to the joint administration with the Emperor. That is Byzantine-Castilian money now, not crown revenue."

Álvaro watches Diego with a trace of amusement. The administrator is meticulous but sometimes loses sight of which pot of money is which.

Diego looks up, his expression more confident now.

"So, to correct myself: the true one-time burden on the Castilian crown treasury for 1434 is the Naples expedition—forty-two thousand florins in transport, supply, and compensation, plus the forty thousand sent earlier for the Sforza contract. Eighty-two thousand total for Naples."

He consults another page.

"Journey costs for the royal fleet—supplies, crew wages, port fees—perhaps another three to four thousand florins over the course of the year."

He sets down his quill.

"Approximately eighty-five to eighty-six thousand florins in extraordinary expenses, Your Majesty. The crown treasury can bear this, but it is not insignificant."

the 40000 was already spent in 1433. 

Read the files at C:\Users\ssicc\Documents\Game\Spain 1430
Use Castille 1433 finances updates and the updates expenses as well. 

We will now draft one single excel file that contains both the finances (income) and expenses report for 1434. So we use the same structure and categories. 

But before we do, we review some incomes and expenses. We have just established that the two one time expenses are the Naples campain and the journey by sea using the crown fleet. 

There are some other expenses categories that I want to discuss. For example, now that Grenada has been taken and settled by the new lords and military orders, I dont think I have to station 11.000 troops there to keep the peace. Right? I ask this from the council.

Contextualized garrison necessity and prepared council response










Don Íñigo López de Mendoza straightens in his chair, as the question falls within his expertise as both a military commander and a member of the Council of Great Houses.

"Your Majesty raises a fair point. The situation in Granada has changed substantially since the conquest."

He steeples his fingers, considering.

"In the first year, eleven thousand men were necessary. The population was uncertain, pockets of resistance remained in the mountains, and the new lords had not yet established their authority. We needed overwhelming presence to prevent rebellion before it could begin."

He glances at Álvaro, who nods for him to continue.

"Now? The Military Orders hold their commanderies and have brought their own men. The new lords have settled their estates and raised local levies. The Moorish population that remained has largely accepted the new order—those who would not have fled to North Africa or the mountains, and the mountain bandits are a matter for local forces, not crown troops."

Sir Thomas Beaumont adds, from his perspective as a military man: "Garrison duty rots soldiers, Your Majesty. Men who sit in conquered cities grow soft and resentful. The best of them would rather be training at the Academy or serving where there is purpose."

Álvaro de Luna speaks carefully: "The question is not whether we need eleven thousand men in Granada. We do not. The question is how many we should retain, and what becomes of the rest."

He counts on his fingers: "Some can be disbanded—returned to their homes. Some can be retained as a reduced garrison, perhaps two or three thousand, to maintain crown presence and respond to any local troubles. And some..." He pauses, glancing at Juan. "Some might be repositioned for other purposes. The Constantinople commitment, perhaps. Or held in reserve for future needs."

Diego de Daza's eyes light up at the financial implications. "Eleven thousand troops at the rates we pay costs the crown nearly twenty-six thousand florins annually. Reducing to three thousand would save approximately seventeen thousand florins per year."

The council waits for Juan's direction.

Can the governor of Grenada not handle this with his own forces? I would rather give out titles then pay men to hold a fort.

18 dec 2025

Examined feudal obligations and assessed local forces' capacity





Álvaro exchanges a glance with Don Íñigo. There is a flicker of something—approval, perhaps—at the king's instinct toward feudal rather than centralized solutions.

Don Íñigo speaks first: "Don García López de Padilla is Master of the Order of Calatrava. He commands the Order's own forces—several hundred knights and men-at-arms. And the Order now holds substantial commanderies in Granada, as do Santiago and Alcántara."

He begins counting the forces available to the Governor without crown expense:

"The three Military Orders together maintain perhaps fifteen hundred to two thousand men in their Granadan holdings. The new lords—those who received grants for their service in the crusade—owe feudal levies. If summoned, they could raise another two to three thousand from their estates."

Álvaro nods slowly. "Your Majesty's instinct is sound. The purpose of granting titles and lands is precisely this—the lord defends what is his. If we pay crown soldiers to do what the lords should do themselves, we teach them that the crown will bear their burdens."

Archbishop Cerezuela adds, his voice dry: "And we impoverish ourselves in the process, while they grow fat on rents they do not earn through service."

Sir Thomas Beaumont leans forward. "In England, the crown maintains few permanent garrisons. The lords hold the land; the lords defend the land. The crown calls the banners when war comes. It is... more economical."

Diego de Daza is practically vibrating with restrained enthusiasm at the prospect of eliminating a twenty-six thousand florin expense.

Álvaro raises a cautionary hand. "There is one consideration, Your Majesty. A small crown presence—perhaps a few hundred men, a royal banner in Granada city—reminds both the new lords and the remaining Moorish population that the king's eye is upon them. Not enough to do the lords' work for them. Enough to show that Granada remains part of Castile, not a collection of independent fiefdoms."

He pauses.

"Perhaps five hundred men? A token force, costing no more than... " He glances at Diego.

"Twelve hundred florins," Diego supplies instantly. "Perhaps fifteen hundred with officers and maintenance."

The council watches Juan, awaiting his decision.

I will keep the Alhambra for crown purposes and will house 50 soldiers there along with a staff of tax assessors and a few crown marshalls. The rest of the defence of these lands will fall to the new local lords. If there is a rebellion, we will crush it. 

And one other matter. I have now appointed a governor but I have not given the title of duke of Grenada to anyone. What will change if I give the title away? Will this affect my revenue?

18 dec 2025

Analyzed ducal title structures and their financial implications








The council stirs at this question. It touches on fundamental matters of governance, feudal rights, and the relationship between crown and nobility.

Álvaro de Luna speaks carefully, as this is precisely his area of expertise: "Your Majesty, much depends on how the title is granted and what rights accompany it."

He rises and moves to a map on the wall showing the former Emirate.

"There are several possibilities."

Option One: A Titular Dukedom

"The title of Duke of Granada could be granted as an honor only—prestige, precedence at court, a seat on the Council of Great Houses. But the crown retains direct administration, direct taxation, direct authority. The duke is duke in name; the king rules in fact."

He shrugs. "This costs nothing and changes little. But it is also... a thin gift. Men know the difference between a title with teeth and a title without."

Option Two: A Dukedom with Full Rights

"Alternatively, you could create a true duchy—the duke holds Granada as his domain. He collects taxes, administers justice, raises levies. He owes the crown feudal service and perhaps a fixed annual payment, but the day-to-day revenues are his."

Don Íñigo interjects: "This is how the great duchies of France operate. The Duke of Burgundy, the Duke of Brittany—they are near-kings in their own lands."

Álvaro nods grimly. "And therein lies the danger. A Duke of Granada with full rights commands the wealthiest, most fertile territory in Castile outside the heartland. He has ports, trade, a defensible position. Give this to the wrong man, and you create a rival. Give it to the right man..." He pauses. "And you still create someone powerful enough to be a rival to his grandchildren, if not to you."

Diego de Daza clears his throat. "The revenue implications would be substantial, Your Majesty. Granada's contribution to crown revenues—including Málaga customs, the alcabala from trade, agricultural taxes—is perhaps thirty to forty thousand florins annually once fully integrated. If a duke takes this, the crown loses it, save for whatever fixed payment is negotiated."

Option Three: A Limited Dukedom

Archbishop Cerezuela speaks up: "There is a middle path. The duke receives certain estates, certain rights, certain revenues—but not all of Granada. The crown retains the major cities, the ports, the customs. The duke holds rural lands and the obligation to defend them."

Álvaro nods. "This is how Your Majesty has already distributed much of Granada—to the Military Orders, to crusade veterans. A Duke of Granada could be first among these lords, with authority to coordinate defense and settle disputes, but not sovereign over them."

Don Íñigo adds quietly: "There is also the question of who, Your Majesty. The title of Duke of Granada would be the highest in the realm after the crown itself. Whoever receives it becomes the most powerful noble in Castile. This is not merely a financial decision."

The council falls silent, watching Juan.

I will keep the current arrangement. It suits me fine. 

So, we have shaved off a lot of money (GM: we assume this has been done at the beginning of the year for simplicity's sake)

Looking at the income side of things, how are diego's reforms coming along?

18 dec 2025

Synthesized tax reform progress across multiple initiatives




Diego de Daza straightens with visible pride. This is his domain—the patient, unglamorous work of making the kingdom's finances function properly.

"Your Majesty, I am pleased to report that the reforms continue to bear fruit."

He opens a separate ledger, one filled with his own meticulous notations.

Mediterranean Commerce (Málaga Customs Initiative)

"Year one brought five thousand florins—modest, but we were establishing the infrastructure. Warehouses, customs officials, standardized tariffs." He traces a finger down a column. "Year two shows significant growth. Málaga is becoming known as a reliable port. Genoese and Venetian merchants who previously sailed past now stop to trade. The Moorish merchant families who remained have proven... surprisingly cooperative. They know the trade routes; we provide stability."

He looks up. "I project eight to ten thousand florins for 1434, possibly more if the winter storms do not disrupt shipping. By 1436 or 1437, we could see fifteen thousand annually if growth continues."

Council of Great Houses Compliance

Don Íñigo López de Mendoza interjects here, as this falls partly under his purview: "The Council system is working, Your Majesty. When nobles see their peers paying, when disputes are settled fairly, when cooperation brings tangible benefits... resistance fades."

Diego nods. "The twenty-three thousand florins in improved compliance from 1433 appears to be holding. I expect similar returns this year—perhaps slightly higher as more houses recognize the new order is permanent."

General Collection Efficiency

"The less glamorous work," Diego admits. "But important. We have reduced corruption among collectors, standardized assessment methods, closed loopholes that allowed certain estates to underreport. The base crown revenue of one hundred seventy-nine thousand florins..." He pauses. "I believe we can increase this by five to eight thousand annually through efficiency alone, without raising any tax rates."

He sets down his quill.

"In sum, Your Majesty: the reforms are working. Slowly, steadily, without drama. The kingdom grows richer not through conquest or windfall, but through good administration."

Álvaro permits himself a rare smile. "Diego will never write songs about himself. But his ledgers have done more for Castile than many battles."

Diego flushes slightly at the praise.

How are trade revenues coming along? These are always going to be crown revenue, not one of a noble lord.

18 dec 2025

Inventoried crown trade revenues across major ports and trajectories





Diego de Daza nods, flipping to another section of his ledger. This is clearly a subject close to his heart.

"Your Majesty is correct—customs, port duties, and trade tariffs are crown revenue by ancient right. No lord may levy them without explicit royal charter, and Your Majesty has granted no such charters."

He begins laying out the picture:

Seville

"The great prize. Gateway to the Atlantic, the wool trade with Flanders, trade with Portugal and England. Seville's customs generate approximately forty thousand florins annually—more than any other single source save the alcabala itself."

He taps the ledger. "This has been stable for years. Growth is possible if we improve harbor facilities, but Seville is already near capacity during peak trading seasons. Ships sometimes wait days to unload."

Málaga

"The new opportunity. As I mentioned, we began at five thousand florins in 1433. I project eight to ten thousand for 1434." His eyes gleam. "But Málaga's potential is far greater. It is the natural gateway between the Mediterranean and the Castilian interior. Goods that now travel overland from Valencia or Barcelona could come through Málaga instead—if we build the roads and establish the reputation."

He pauses. "In five years, with continued investment, Málaga could rival Seville. Twenty to thirty thousand florins annually is not impossible."

Cádiz and the Atlantic Ports

"Smaller but steady. Cádiz, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, the fishing ports—together perhaps twelve thousand florins. The wine trade, the salt trade, fishing rights." He shrugs. "These will not grow dramatically, but they are reliable."

Bilbao and the Northern Ports

"The iron trade, wool exports to England and Flanders through the Cantabrian ports. Another fifteen thousand florins, roughly. The Basque shipbuilders bring additional revenue—perhaps three thousand in duties on timber and naval supplies."

Internal Tolls

"River crossings, major road junctions, market fees in royal towns. Scattered and difficult to track precisely, but perhaps eight thousand florins total."

Diego sets down his quill and summarizes:

"Total trade revenues across the kingdom: approximately seventy-eight to eighty thousand florins annually, Your Majesty. Of this, perhaps sixty-five thousand is stable and predictable. The remainder—particularly Málaga—is where growth lies."

Álvaro adds: "And crucially, these revenues are crown revenues. They do not diminish when you grant lands to lords. A duke may collect rents from his peasants, but the customs at Málaga remain yours."

Diego nods eagerly. "This is why the Mediterranean commerce initiative matters so much, Your Majesty. Every florin invested in ports and trade infrastructure returns to the crown directly, without passing through noble hands."

Provide the trade income to me in a table

18 dec 2025

Synthesized trade revenue data into tabular format




Diego de Daza produces a fresh sheet of parchment and writes out the figures clearly:

Diego adds beneath the table:

"The Málaga figure is conservative, Your Majesty. If the autumn shipping season proves strong, we may exceed ten thousand. And this is only the second year—the potential for growth remains substantial."

He looks up from the parchment.

"Shall I include this breakdown in the formal 1434 accounts?"

Diego looks up from the parchment, barely containing his satisfaction.

"Your Majesty, the reduction of the Granada garrison alone saves the crown nearly twenty-five thousand florins. Total recurring expenses have fallen from one hundred twenty-five thousand to ninety thousand."

He pauses.

"Shall I compare this against projected revenues?"

Now list the projected revenue

18 dec 2025

Diego sets down his quill and looks up.

"Your Majesty, if these projections hold, the kingdom's position is strong."

He quickly calculates:

Summary	Amount (Florins)
Total Revenue	323,094
Total Expenses	136,430
Net Surplus 1434	186,664
"A surplus of nearly one hundred eighty-seven thousand florins, Your Majesty. Added to the treasury balance of three hundred seventy-one thousand from year-end 1433..."

He pauses, double-checking his arithmetic.

"The crown treasury would stand at approximately five hundred fifty-eight thousand florins by year-end 1434."

Álvaro de Luna allows himself a thin smile. "A war chest, Your Majesty. Should you need it."

But I also own some estates directly. And I have aquired all the estates of the enfantes and have been optimizing them with Diego. Where are theye included in these statements?

18 dec 2025

Identified missing estate revenue streams requiring clarification





Diego de Daza freezes, his quill hovering over the parchment. A flush creeps up his neck.

"Your Majesty is... correct. I have not listed them separately."

He shuffles through his papers, clearly embarrassed at the oversight.

Álvaro de Luna's eyes narrow. "Diego. Where are the royal estates in these accounts?"

Diego clears his throat. "They are... partially embedded in the base revenue figures, my lord. But Your Majesty is right to ask. The distinction matters."

He pulls out an older ledger, one with more worn pages.

"The crown holds estates directly in several categories:"

Traditional Royal Estates (Realengo)

"Lands held by the crown since time immemorial—farms, vinting estates, pastures, forests. These generate rents, agricultural produce sold at market, timber rights, grazing fees. I have been accounting these under 'Royal Monopolies' but..." He winces. "That is imprecise. They deserve separate accounting."

Confiscated Infantes' Estates

"The holdings seized from Don Juan and Don Enrique of Aragón after their rebellion. These were substantial, Your Majesty." He flips pages rapidly. "Medina del Campo. Olmedo. Cuéllar. Arévalo. Portillo. Peñafiel. Some of the richest agricultural land in Castile."

He looks up, his expression shifting from embarrassment to professional interest.

"I have been optimizing these, as Your Majesty commanded. Renegotiating tenant arrangements, improving irrigation on some properties, clearing titles that were in dispute. But I confess I have not prepared a separate statement of their revenues."

Álvaro's voice is dry: "Then perhaps you should tell His Majesty what these estates are generating, even approximately."

Diego swallows. "I would need to compile the figures properly. But from memory..."

He pauses, calculating.

"The traditional royal estates perhaps twelve to fifteen thousand florins annually. The Infantes' confiscated lands... these are more substantial. Perhaps thirty to forty thousand florins, now that the optimization work is showing results."

He meets Juan's eyes.

"Shall I prepare a complete accounting of all crown-held estates, Your Majesty? Separate from the tax revenues? It is work I should have done already."

Include crown estates as a seperate category in the overview. Provide a new listing of the revenue

18 dec 2025

Reorganized revenue categories and reconciled estate valuations separately








Diego nods, chastened but grateful for the opportunity to correct his oversight. He takes a fresh sheet and begins anew.

Diego sets down his quill, his earlier embarrassment replaced by evident satisfaction.

"Over six hundred thousand florins, Your Majesty. I apologize for the earlier omission—the crown estates deserve proper tracking. With your permission, I will establish a separate ledger for estate revenues going forward."

Álvaro de Luna studies the figures. "This is a remarkable position for the kingdom. Your Majesty's father, God rest him, never saw half this sum in the treasury."

Diego, if we start a major investment program. Say 150.000 florins to improve infrastructure, ports ships, roads, bridges or other investments, how wouold you go about this?

18 dec 2025

Orchestrated Diego's methodical infrastructure investment strategy response



Diego de Daza's eyes widen slightly. One hundred fifty thousand florins is an enormous sum—nearly half the annual revenue of the kingdom. But his administrator's mind is already working, and after a moment's thought, he begins to speak.

"Your Majesty, an investment of this magnitude requires careful structure. Spent poorly, it vanishes like water into sand. Spent wisely..." He pauses, gathering his thoughts. "It transforms the kingdom."

He rises and moves to a side table, retrieving a blank sheet of parchment.

"I would approach this in four parts."

First: Prioritization

"Not all investments are equal. Some generate returns quickly; others take decades. Some benefit the crown directly; others benefit the kingdom generally, which benefits the crown indirectly."

He begins sketching categories:

"Ports and customs infrastructure return money to the crown treasury directly. Every florin spent improving Málaga's harbor generates customs revenue for years to come. This is the highest priority."

"Roads and bridges benefit trade, which increases customs revenue and the alcabala. The return is real but indirect. Still, a road from Málaga to Toledo would transform commerce."

"Ships serve multiple purposes—war, trade protection, transport. The four carracks built last year already prove their worth. More vessels extend the crown's reach."

"Agricultural improvements—irrigation, drainage, mills—increase production on crown estates. The return is slow but permanent."

Second: Phasing

"One hundred fifty thousand florins cannot be spent wisely in a single year. There are not enough skilled workers, not enough materials, not enough competent overseers."

He writes figures as he speaks:

"I would recommend a three-year program. Fifty thousand florins annually, perhaps. This allows each project to be properly supervised, mistakes to be corrected, and results to be assessed before committing further funds."

Third: Oversight

"This is where such programs fail, Your Majesty." His voice grows firm. "Money flows from the treasury to intermediaries to contractors to workers—and at each step, it leaks. Men steal. Men lie about progress. Men deliver inferior work and pocket the difference."

He taps the parchment emphatically.

"I would require three things: independent inspectors who answer only to the crown, milestone payments released only when work is verified complete, and severe penalties for fraud—including seizure of assets and imprisonment."

Don Íñigo López de Mendoza interjects quietly: "The Military Orders have experience building fortifications. Their discipline might serve as a model—or their engineers could be borrowed for oversight."

Diego nods. "An excellent suggestion."

Fourth: Expected Returns

"Your Majesty will want to know what such investment yields."

He calculates aloud:

"Málaga harbor improvements—ten thousand florins invested might increase customs revenue by two to three thousand annually. A permanent return of twenty to thirty percent."

"A proper road from Málaga to Toledo—perhaps forty thousand florins over three years. This could increase trade volume substantially, adding five to eight thousand in customs and alcabala revenues annually."

"Additional ships—fourteen thousand florins per carrack. Each vessel earns its cost through trade protection, transport savings, and potential prizes within five to seven years."

He looks up from his calculations.

"Properly executed, Your Majesty, a one hundred fifty thousand florin investment program could add fifteen to twenty-five thousand florins in annual revenue within five years. The investment pays for itself within a decade, and then continues paying forever."

Álvaro de Luna has been listening intently. "There is also the matter of employment, Your Majesty. Such a program puts men to work—masons, carpenters, laborers, carters. Men with wages spend money. Merchants profit. The alcabala collects its share. The benefits ripple outward."

Diego nods. "The Constable speaks truly. The indirect benefits are difficult to calculate but real."

He sets down his quill and meets Juan's eyes.

"If Your Majesty wishes, I can prepare a detailed proposal—specific projects, costs, timelines, expected returns. It would take me perhaps two weeks to do properly."

Lets talk about expanding the fleet seperately. I want to set up a fleet that can trade by transporting cargo and men, but can also function in a battle. Can carracks fit this role?

18 dec 2025

Examined carracks' dual-purpose viability and historical trade-offs comprehensively








The council stirs at this shift in topic. Naval matters are not the strongest expertise at this table, but several members have relevant knowledge.

Álvaro de Luna speaks first: "Your Majesty built four carracks last year at considerable expense—fifty-eight thousand florins. They served well in transporting men to Constantinople and Naples. Captain Fernán, you sailed on them. What is your assessment?"

Captain Fernán straightens. He is a soldier, not a sailor, but he has spent months at sea this past year.

"The carracks are sturdy vessels, Your Majesty. They carried our men and horses safely through rough waters. The sailors speak well of them." He pauses, choosing his words carefully. "But I am no naval expert. I can tell you how they feel under foot, not how they would perform in battle."

Sir Thomas Beaumont leans forward. "In England, we use similar vessels—large sailing ships that carry cargo in peacetime and mount guns in war. The great ships of King Henry's fleet serve both purposes." He frowns thoughtfully. "But there are trade-offs. A ship built purely for war is faster, more maneuverable. A ship built purely for trade carries more cargo. The dual-purpose vessel does both, but excels at neither."

Don Íñigo López de Mendoza adds: "The Aragonese and Catalans have long experience in Mediterranean naval matters. King Alfonso maintains both galleys and round ships. Perhaps his admirals could advise..."

Diego de Daza interjects with the financial perspective: "Each carrack cost approximately fourteen thousand florins to build, Your Majesty. They require crews of perhaps fifty to eighty men for sailing. In wartime, they would need additional soldiers—marines, gunners. The ongoing costs are substantial."

Álvaro raises a hand. "Perhaps we should hear what Your Majesty envisions. A fleet for what purpose? Trade with where? War against whom? The answers shape what vessels we need."

I need a fleet that can transport 15.000 men from Iberia to Constantinople. In one trip. If the sultan attacks we need this army to sail immediately to relieve the city. I want this fleet to be able to perform trade as well as be able to face the Ottoman navy in battle. Maybe build a fleet of mixed types?

18 dec 2025

Architected mixed-fleet strategy balancing transport, trade, and naval combat capabilities










The council falls silent. The scale of what Juan proposes is staggering.

Álvaro de Luna is the first to recover. "Fifteen thousand men in one voyage. Your Majesty, that is... an enormous undertaking. The largest fleet Castile has ever assembled."

He turns to the others, inviting their input.

Sir Thomas Beaumont speaks from his English experience:

"When King Henry invaded France, he required over a thousand ships to transport his army—though many were small vessels, fishing boats pressed into service." He shakes his head. "But the English Channel is narrow. Iberia to Constantinople is... weeks at sea. You need proper ocean-going vessels, not coastal craft."

He begins calculating aloud: "A large carrack can carry perhaps two hundred fifty to three hundred men in military transport conditions—crowded, uncomfortable, but feasible. For fifteen thousand men, you would need fifty to sixty carracks of good size."

He pauses. "Plus horses. If you are transporting knights, you need horse transports. A carrack might carry thirty to forty horses, no more. Heavy cavalry requires many additional vessels."

Don Íñigo López de Mendoza raises another consideration:

"The voyage itself is perilous. From Cádiz or Málaga to Constantinople—through the Strait of Gibraltar, along the Barbary coast, past Sicily, through waters controlled by Genoa, Venice, and the Ottomans themselves." He frowns. "Such a fleet would need escorts. Warships to protect the transports."

Diego de Daza has been scribbling calculations:

"Your Majesty, if we assume sixty carracks at fourteen thousand florins each... that alone is eight hundred forty thousand florins. More than the entire treasury."

He looks up, slightly pale.

"And that is only the transports. Before escorts, before crews, before supplies."

Álvaro steers the conversation back to practicalities:

"Your Majesty asked about a mixed fleet. This is wise. Different vessels serve different purposes."

He counts on his fingers:

"Carracks—large, sturdy, can carry men and cargo. They mount guns and have high castles that make them difficult to board. In battle, they serve as floating fortresses. But they are slow, dependent on wind, and vulnerable to galleys in calm waters."

"Galleys—the weapon of Mediterranean war. Fast, maneuverable, independent of wind. The Ottomans use them extensively. But they cannot make the Atlantic voyage safely, they require enormous crews of rowers, and they carry little cargo."

"Galleasses—a compromise. Larger than galleys, they combine oars and sails. Venice uses them. They can fight and carry modest cargo. But they are expensive and complex."

He spreads his hands.

"A fleet to do what Your Majesty describes would need all three types, I think. Carracks for transport and heavy combat. Galleys for battle and protecting the carracks in calm waters. Perhaps smaller vessels—caravels, pinnaces—for scouting and communication."

Captain Fernán adds a soldier's perspective:

"Your Majesty, I have seen the Ottoman galleys from the deck of our carracks. They are fast—terrifyingly fast. If they catch a carrack becalmed, they swarm it like wolves on a wounded stag." He pauses. "But if the wind is with you, a carrack's guns can shatter a galley before it closes. The question is always the wind."

The council looks to Juan, awaiting direction. The questions hang in the air:

How many ships of each type? Built where? Crewed by whom? At what cost? Over what timeframe?

This is not realistic. Lets allocate 200.000 florins to naval expansion. I want to build my own ships myself using the most modern techniques and develop our own expertise in building them. 

But before we do so, it becomes apparent to me that me miss an important figure in this council. I need an admiral who knows what he is doing and who can lead this big investment effort. 

Diego, put aside 200.000 florins for naval investment. And we allocate 40.000 florins for the coming 5 years to improve infrastructure and some other improvement projects. 

Also, can we look at the workshops that are here in Castille? I know we produce a lot of iron. Can we build more workshops that make tools and weapons from it?

Orchestrated three strategic initiatives: naval expansion, infrastructure investment, and industrial capacity assessment






Diego de Daza nods, making careful notations in his ledger.

"Two hundred thousand florins reserved for naval expansion, to be spent under the direction of a competent admiral. Forty thousand florins annually for infrastructure improvements over five years." He calculates quickly. "That is four hundred thousand florins committed over the period—substantial, but the treasury can bear it, particularly with the surplus we are generating."

He notes the figures and looks up.

On the Matter of an Admiral

Álvaro de Luna strokes his chin thoughtfully. "Your Majesty is wise to seek expertise before spending. A fleet built by landsmen is a fleet built poorly."

He considers the options:

"Castile has capable ship captains—men who know the Atlantic trade, the fishing grounds, the route to Flanders. But a true admiral? One who understands fleet tactics, shipyard management, naval architecture?" He shakes his head slowly. "We have not fought a major naval war in living memory. Our expertise lies on land."

Don Íñigo offers: "The Aragonese have such men. King Alfonso's admirals have fought in the Mediterranean for generations. Perhaps he could lend us an expert, or recommend a man willing to enter Castilian service."

Sir Thomas Beaumont adds: "The Genoese are the finest shipbuilders in Christendom. Their admirals command fleets across the known world. A Genoese captain seeking new employment might bring both expertise and connections to shipwrights."

Álvaro nods slowly. "There are also the Portuguese. Prince Henry—they call him the Navigator—has been building ships and training captains at Sagres for years. They explore the African coast, develop new vessel designs. A Portuguese naval man would know modern techniques."

He turns to Juan. "Shall I make inquiries, Your Majesty? Discreetly, to determine who might be available and suitable?"

On the Matter of Workshops

Diego de Daza brightens at this question—it touches on economic development, his passion.

"Your Majesty is correct that Castile produces abundant iron. The Basque country—Vizcaya, Guipúzcoa—has mines and foundries that have operated for centuries. Bilbao exports iron ingots across Europe."

He pulls out another ledger, one covering economic surveys.

"But Your Majesty identifies a weakness. We export raw iron and import finished goods—tools, weapons, armor, nails, fittings. The profit in transformation goes to foreign smiths."

He warms to the subject:

"Toledo already has a reputation for fine swordsmithing—the espadas toledanas are prized throughout Christendom. But this is artisan work, small workshops producing luxury goods. What Your Majesty describes is different—large workshops producing tools and weapons in quantity."

Don Íñigo interjects: "The Military Orders maintain their own armories. Calatrava especially has skilled smiths who produce weapons and armor for the knights. Perhaps their methods could be expanded."

Diego nods eagerly. "If we established royal workshops—manufacturas reales—near the iron sources in the north, we could produce standardized tools, weapons, ship fittings, nails by the thousands. The iron travels a short distance to the workshop; the finished goods travel to markets across the kingdom and beyond."

He hesitates. "But this requires expertise we do not fully possess. Master smiths who understand large-scale production. Investment in water-powered hammers, proper forges, storage facilities. Perhaps..."

He glances at Sir Thomas.

"Perhaps we could recruit master craftsmen from abroad? Flanders, Germany, Milan—these places have developed such industries. A few skilled masters could train Castilian apprentices."

Álvaro summarizes: "So we need an admiral for the fleet, and master smiths for the workshops. Your Majesty builds a kingdom that requires expertise Castile does not yet possess."

The council waits for Juan's direction.

I will ask if Alfonso can send me an officer to serve as my admiral. I miss the expertise. 

We also recruit experts from abroad to set up these smithies for both naval supplies and weapons. Invite them to come before my court and I will give them a royal grant and funds to set these workshops up. 

What else can we produce in our kingdom that can increase our production?

Catalogued medieval Castilian production resources and industries



The council stirs with interest. This is a question that touches on the future prosperity of the kingdom.

Diego de Daza practically glows—this is precisely the kind of strategic thinking he lives for.

"Your Majesty asks the right question. A kingdom that exports raw materials and imports finished goods will always be poorer than one that transforms its own resources."

He begins listing opportunities, ticking them off on his fingers:

Wool and Textiles

"This is our greatest untapped opportunity, Your Majesty. Castilian merino wool is the finest in Europe—Flemish and Italian weavers pay premium prices for it. But we sell them the wool, and they sell us back the cloth at three times the price."

He shakes his head in frustration.

"We have attempted textile workshops before, but they produce coarse cloth that cannot compete with Flemish quality. The expertise lies in Flanders, in Florence, in the Italian cities. If we could recruit master weavers—as Your Majesty suggests for the smiths—we could produce fine cloth ourselves."

Don Íñigo adds: "Segovia already has some textile production. The infrastructure exists; it is the skill that is lacking."

Diego nods. "A royal textile manufactory in Segovia, staffed with Flemish masters training Castilian apprentices... within a decade, we could be producing cloth for domestic consumption. Within two decades, perhaps for export."

Leather

"Córdoba," Diego says simply. "The cordobanes and guadamecíes—Córdoban leather—are already famous throughout Europe. This industry exists and thrives. The Moorish craftsmen who remained after the conquest generations ago passed their techniques to Christian workers."

He pauses. "What we lack is scale. The workshops are small, family operations. Royal investment could expand production—more tanneries, more craftsmen, standardized quality. Leather for saddles, armor, boots, bookbinding... the market is vast."

Silk

Archbishop Cerezuela speaks up unexpectedly: "Granada."

The council turns to him.

"The Moors cultivated silk in Granada for centuries. Mulberry groves, silkworm farms, weaving workshops. When Your Majesty conquered the emirate, you inherited this industry." He folds his hands. "I am told production has... declined since the conquest. The skilled workers fled, or were displaced, or simply stopped working under new masters they did not trust."

Diego grimaces. "The Archbishop speaks truly. Granada's silk production has fallen by half or more. But the mulberry trees still stand. The knowledge still exists among some who remained. With proper encouragement—protection for the craftsmen, guaranteed purchases, perhaps tax relief—the industry could recover."

Salt and Salted Fish

"The crown already holds the salt monopoly," Diego notes. "But we could do more with it. The Atlantic fisheries—cod, sardines—are enormous. Portuguese and Basque fishermen already work these waters. Salted fish feeds armies and navies; it travels without spoiling."

Captain Fernán nods. "On campaign, salted fish is worth its weight in silver. A reliable supply would strengthen any military expedition."

Diego continues: "Royal investment in salting facilities along the Atlantic coast—Galicia, Asturias—could create a new export industry. The English and Flemish buy salted fish in great quantities."

Paper

"A smaller opportunity, but significant," Diego says. "Paper is increasingly important—for records, books, correspondence. We import most of it from Italy. But paper mills require only water power, rags for pulp, and knowledge of the process."

He glances at Sir Thomas. "I understand there are mills in France and Germany now. The technique spreads. A royal paper mill could supply the chancery, the universities, the Church—and reduce our dependence on imports."

Ceramics and Glass

"Talavera already produces fine ceramics," Diego notes. "The industry could be expanded. Glass is more difficult—Venetian glassmakers guard their secrets jealously, and Venice forbids them from leaving on pain of death."

He shrugs. "Still, secrets escape. A skilled glassmaker willing to risk Venice's wrath could establish an industry here."

Shipbuilding

"This connects to Your Majesty's naval ambitions," Diego says. "The Basque shipyards already build fine vessels. But they work on traditional designs. If we recruit foreign experts—Genoese, Portuguese, perhaps Venetian—we could learn new techniques. Better ships, built faster, at lower cost."

He pauses meaningfully. "A kingdom that builds its own fleet is a kingdom that controls its own destiny."

Álvaro de Luna summarizes:

"So we have opportunities in textiles, leather, silk, salted fish, paper, ceramics, and shipbuilding. All require some combination of capital investment, foreign expertise, and patient development."

He looks at Juan.

"Your Majesty cannot pursue all of these at once. Which industries does the crown wish to prioritize? And shall we establish a formal program—perhaps a Junta de Manufacturas—to oversee these investments?"

We will develop all these industries at once. But in an organized way. 

I will indeed include a Junta de manufacturas and have a representative attend our Toledo council. We use this year to summon experts in all these fields and hear from them what they need to set up these workshops. 

Except for the leather, salt, and silk workshops. These industries already exist and shall expand this year. We need to appoint the junta and make sure these industries have everything they need. Lets reserve 6000 florins to fund these industries for now

Include a donation of 5000 each to the military orders. I have more tasks for them. 

Diego, do you have enough information to now draft the entire budget for the year 1434?

Orchestrated financial planning framework for comprehensive budget compilation





















Diego de Daza finishes his final calculations and presents the completed ledger to the council.

"Your Majesty, the accounts for 1434 are complete."

CASTILE 1434 — TREASURY SUMMARY
Amount (Florins)
Opening Treasury (Jan 1, 1434)	371,823
Total Revenue	371,594
Expenses:	
Annual/Recurring	90,430
One-Time (Naples, Journey)	46,000
New Commitments (Infrastructure, Junta, Military Orders)	61,000
Total Expenses	197,430
Net Surplus	174,164
Treasury Year-End 1434	545,987
Less: Naval Investment Reserve	(200,000)
Available Treasury	345,987
Diego looks up from the ledger.

"Your Majesty, even after setting aside two hundred thousand florins for the naval expansion—money that remains in the treasury but committed to a specific purpose—we retain nearly three hundred fifty thousand florins in available funds. The kingdom has never been wealthier."

Álvaro de Luna nods slowly. "The reduction of the Granada garrison alone saves twenty-five thousand florins annually. The reforms pay for themselves many times over."

Diego adds: "I have prepared the full accounts in five sections: Treasury Summary, Revenue Details, Expense Details, Reserved Funds, and Year-End Summary. All categories are documented."

He pauses. "I recommend Your Majesty save this to your records alongside the 1433 accounts. The file is ready."

The Excel file contains all income and expenses for 1434, formatted consistently with your previous financial records. Save it to your Spain 1430 folder to maintain continuity.
