This is Chapter 2.16, and we are in the middle of Juan's visit to Barcelona in mid-January 1434. The user said \"we are about to go to our next appointment.\"\n\nLooking at the Outstanding Matters from Chapter 2.15:\n1. **María** – Juan must speak with her again before sailing\n2. **Lucia speaking with María** – May help bridge the gap\n3. **Don Ramon de Perellós** – Awaiting audience on court administration and visit itinerary\n4. **Consell de Cent** – Midday reception with city council and merchant guilds\n5. **Count of Pallars** – Private afternoon audience requested\n6. **Don Guillem de Vic** – Wants to report on drafted communications\n7. **Bishop's Mass** – Tomorrow morning at hour of Terce, Cathedral of Santa Eulàlia\n8. **Constantinople Expedition** – Fleet and knights ready, departure approaching\n\nThe morning of Day 12 has already happened:\n- Reconciliation with Lucia\n- Painful meeting with María\n- Successful meeting with Bishop\n\nBased on the timeline, the next items on the agenda would be:\n- Don Ramon de Perellós (awaiting audience on court administration and visit itinerary)\n- Then midday: Consell de Cent (city council and merchant guilds)\n- Then afternoon: Count of Pallars\n\nLet me set up the scene for the next appointment. Don Ramon de Perellós seems to be the next logical meeting, as he's the head of the regency council and was described as \"awaiting audience.\"\n\nLet me also make sure I understand who Don Ramon de Perellós is from the Chapter 2.15 summary - he's the head of the regency council for Aragon, and he privately briefed Juan about the two factions. So Juan has already met him briefly. Now Juan would be having a more formal audience.\n\nWait - let me re-read the timeline more carefully. \n\nI see we're still on Day 12, following the morning's events with the Bishop. Don Ramon de Perellós is the next scheduled meeting, waiting to discuss court administration and the visit's itinerary. This follows the established sequence of appointments for the day, with the formal audience providing an opportunity to delve deeper into the political landscape of Aragon.\n\n\nNow I have the full picture. We're in Barcelona, mid-January 1434, on Day 12 of your visit. This morning you reconciled with Lucia, had a painful but open-ended conversation with María, and had a transformative meeting with Bishop Francesc Climent Sapera.\n\n\nAccording to the schedule, your next appointment is with Don Ramon de Perellós, head of the regency council, who is awaiting audience on court administration and the itinerary for the remainder of your Barcelona visit.\n\n\n\nThe morning sun has climbed higher over Barcelona by the time you emerge from the bishop's study. The bells of Santa Eulàlia toll the end of Terce somewhere behind you, their bronze voices echoing through the narrow streets of the Barri Gòtic.\n\n\nCaptain Robles falls into step beside you as you cross the cloister garden. \"Your Majesty, Don Ramon de Perellós awaits in the regent's council chamber. He sent word asking whether you wished him to attend you here, or if you preferred to meet in the Palau Reial.\"\n\n\nThe walk back to the palace would take perhaps a quarter hour through the winding streets. The morning air is crisp but not cold—mild for January, even by Mediterranean standards.\n\n\nLucia remained at the palace with Catalina after your departure for the bishop's meeting. The Consell de Cent, Barcelona's powerful city council and merchant guilds, expects you at midday. The Count of Pallars has requested a private audience for the afternoon.\n\n\nThere is much still to accomplish before the fleet sails.\n\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

      "say": "Thought process: Architected regent's hidden agenda and conversational resistance tactics.\n\nThe player wants to visit Don Ramon de Perellós at the Palau Reial. Let me think about this NPC carefully.\n\n**Don Ramon de Perellós** - Head of the regency council for Aragon while Alfonso V is in Naples.\n\nWhat does this NPC want?\n- He wants to maintain his own power and position in the regency\n- He wants to manage Juan carefully - Juan is powerful, popular, and potentially disruptive to the delicate balance he's maintained\n- He wants to understand Juan's true intentions regarding Aragon - is Juan here to help, or to eventually absorb/dominate?\n- He wants to ensure the regency council's authority isn't undermined by Juan's direct relationships with faction leaders\n- He's probably nervous that Juan went directly to faction leaders (Pallars, Guillem) and the bishop without consulting him first\n- He wants to control the itinerary and manage Juan's access to key people\n\nWhat won't he say?\n- He won't say he's worried about his own position\n- He won't say he's uncomfortable with how Juan is building direct relationships that bypass the regency council\n- He won't say he's uncertain whether Juan's \"family unity\" rhetoric is genuine or a prelude to Castilian dominance\n- He won't reveal his own assessment of which faction he privately favors (he has to appear neutral as head of the regency)\n- He won't admit that María has confided in him about her concerns regarding Juan\n\nLet me also think about what the chapter summary tells us:\n- Don Ramon privately briefed Juan on the two factions (Aragonese vs Neapolitan) at the reception\n- He's described as head of the regency council\n- He's awaiting audience on \"court administration and visit itinerary\"\n\nSo he's probably going to:\n1. Try to control Juan's schedule and access\n2. Probe what Juan discussed with the bishop (church matters are politically sensitive)\n3. Try to understand what Juan offered to faction leaders\n\n\n4. Subtly remind Juan that the regency council is the proper channel for dealings with Aragon\n5. Present administrative matters that serve his own agenda\n\nHe'll strategically navigate the conversation, using bureaucratic protocol to subtly assert the council's authority. His approach will be measured and diplomatic, seeking to understand Juan's motives while protecting the regency's interests. The interaction will be a delicate dance of political maneuvering, with Don Ramon carefully probing and positioning himself to maintain control.\n\n\nNPC Analysis - Don Ramon de Perellós:\n\n\nWhat he wants: To control Juan's access and schedule; to reassert the regency council as the proper channel for all dealings with Aragon; to understand what Juan has been promising to people without going through him first.\n\nWhat he won't say: That Juan's direct conversations with faction leaders and the bishop have already undermined his position; that María has spoken to him about their difficult meeting; that he fears Juan's \"family\" rhetoric is cover for Castilian absorption.\n\n\n\nThe walk through the Barri Gòtic is pleasant despite the weight of the morning's conversations. Lucia walks beside you, her hand resting lightly on your arm. She says little, but her presence is steady.\n\n\nThe Palau Reial rises at the heart of the old city—less imposing than Toledo's Alcázar, but older, its stones worn smooth by centuries of Catalan counts and Aragonese kings. The guards at the gate snap to attention as you approach, and a steward appears almost immediately to escort you through the courtyard.\n\n\nDon Ramon de Perellós receives you in the regent's council chamber—a long room dominated by a heavy oak table and tapestries depicting the conquest of Majorca. He rises from behind a desk cluttered with documents, bowing precisely.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty. Your Majesty.\" The second bow, shallower, to Lucia. \"I trust the morning has been productive.\"\n\n\nHis face is carefully pleasant. He is perhaps sixty, grey-bearded, with the watchful eyes of a man who has survived four years of managing competing factions while the actual king fights wars in Italy.\n\n\n\"I have prepared a proposed itinerary for Your Majesty's remaining time in Barcelona.\" He gestures to a document on the desk. \"The Consell de Cent at midday, as arranged. The Count of Pallars has requested a private audience—I have suggested the fourth hour after noon, if that suits. Don Guillem de Vic wishes to present certain communications he has drafted on Your Majesty's behalf.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, straightening a stack of papers that did not need straightening.\n\n\n\"I understand Your Majesty visited Bishop Climent Sapera this morning. A lengthy meeting, by all accounts.\"\n\n\nThe observation hangs in the air—not quite a question, not quite an accusation."

Now let me read the Kingdom guide.\n\n\nView: Read Kingdom of Castile guide for context\n\n\nThought process: Strategized Don Ramon's cautious approach and concealed motivations.\n\nNow I have the full context. Let me think about Don Ramon de Perellós:\n\n**What does Don Ramon want?**\n1. To control access to the regency - he's the head of the regency council and Juan has been going around him\n2. To understand what Juan's promises mean for Aragon's future - he's worried about Castilian absorption\n3. To protect his own position - if Juan and María work things out, or if Alfonso returns, where does that leave him?\n4. To assert that proper channels matter - Juan's been making deals directly with faction leaders and clergy without going through him\n\n**What won't he say?**\n1. That María has spoken to him about their difficult conversation\n2. That he's worried Juan's \"family\" rhetoric is cover for Castilian dominance\n3. That he fears becoming irrelevant if Juan builds direct relationships with everyone\n4. That the bishop's meeting concerns him because it suggests Juan is building alternative power bases\n\n**His approach:**\n- He will be superficially polite and helpful\n- He will use bureaucratic control to gather intelligence and slow things down\n- He will probe to understand what Juan has been promising\n- He will try to reassert the regency council as the proper channel for all dealings\n- He won't be openly hostile, but he won't be helpful either\n\nJuan has invited him to discuss matters of his own concern. This is smart - Juan is asking before telling (what he learned from Lucia). But Don Ramon will be cautious about revealing what he actually wants. He'll test Juan first.\n\nLet me write the scene.\n\n\nNow I have the full context from both guides. Let me continue the scene with Don Ramon.\n\n\n\nDon Ramon inclines his head at Juan's offer, his expression revealing nothing.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty is gracious.\"\n\n\nHe does not immediately continue. Instead, he moves to the window, adjusting the angle of a shutter as if the light offended him. When he turns back, his hands are clasped behind his back—the posture of a man preparing to deliver a report.\n\n\n\"The matter of the itinerary is not... merely logistical.\" He pauses, selecting his words with evident care. \"Barcelona is not Toledo, Your Majesty. The Consell de Cent guards its prerogatives jealously. The Count of Pallars speaks for nobles who remember when Aragón's king lived in Aragón. The merchants want to know whether Castilian trade agreements will respect Catalan privileges.\"\n\n\nHe moves to the desk, picks up a document, sets it down again without looking at it.\n\n\n\"In four years as head of the regency council, I have learned that scheduling is governance. Who sees the king, and when, and in what order—these things matter. They send signals. They create expectations. They establish... hierarchies.\"\n\n\nHis eyes meet Juan's directly for the first time.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty arrived yesterday evening. Since then, you have spoken privately with Don Guillem de Vic, with the Count of Pallars, and this morning—at considerable length—with Bishop Climent Sapera.\" The recitation is precise, without inflection. \"The regency council was not consulted regarding any of these conversations.\"\n\n\nHe lets the observation hang in the air, then adds, almost as an afterthought:\n\n\n\"Queen María has requested that I coordinate all further meetings through Her Majesty's secretary. She wishes to be informed in advance of Your Majesty's appointments.\""

He does not say of course or think nothing of it. He simply... notes it.\n\n\nWhen Juan asks about matters to discuss and the council's concerns, Don Ramon's expression shifts almost imperceptibly—a tightening around the eyes that might be frustration, might be calculation.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty asks what the council's concerns are.\" He moves back toward the desk, fingers brushing the stack of documents there. \"That is a... complex question. The council's concerns depend greatly on circumstances. On what is being proposed.

In that time, I have learned that I cannot advise a king on what he should do until I understand what he has done.\" The words are precise, carefully neutral. \"Don Guillem de Vic left the reception last night speaking of 'great things to come' and 'bringing the kingdoms together.' The Count of Pallars sent a messenger to his estates at first light—I do not know why.

Complete transparency - Don Ramon wanted information, Juan is providing it\n2. Admission of error - Juan acknowledges he should have consulted María first\n3. The vision of \"neither holding dominance\" - addresses the core fear of Castilian absorption\n4. Asking Don Ramon directly about succession - shows respect for his knowledge\n5. Juan's track record (Reconquista, papal favor) gives weight to his words\n\n**Failure Factors (things working against Juan):**\n1. The damage may already be done - factions are already reacting\n2. \"Vision for a better world\" sounds grandiose and potentially dangerous\n3. Discussing succession with María before the regency council is a serious breach\n4. Don Ramon has been managing these factions for 4 years - he knows how fragile the balance is\n5. \"Bringing kingdoms together\" even without dominance still threatens Aragonese independence\n6. Juan is essentially asking Don Ramon to trust his intentions after bypassing him\n7. Don Ramon serves María and Alfonso, not Juan - his loyalty is to Aragon's interests\n8. The succession question is extremely sensitive - Carlos of Viana is dead, which changes everything\n\n**Key psychological factors:**\n- Don Ramon has sunk costs - 4 years of careful balance\n- Identity: he is the guardian of Aragonese interests, not a facilitator for Castilian ambitions\n\n\n- Deeply risk-averse approach to potential kingdom-altering decisions\n- Prioritizes maintaining the delicate political equilibrium he's carefully constructed\n\nThe political landscape reveals critical uncertainties. Succession hangs in a precarious balance, with no clear heir and multiple potential claims. Juan's approach demonstrates strategic transparency, but risks undermining the established political mechanisms that Don Ramon has meticulously maintained.\n\n\nApproach Quality Assessment:\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nComplete transparency—Don Ramon asked for information and is receiving it fully\n\nAdmission of error regarding María—shows self-awareness and humility\n\n\"Neither holding dominance\"—directly addresses the core Aragonese fear\n\nAsking Don Ramon's expertise on succession—shows respect for his knowledge\n\nJuan's track record (Reconquista completed, papal favor, treasury returned) gives credibility\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nFour years of careful factional balance may have been disrupted in twenty-four hours\n\n\"Vision for a better world\" sounds like messianic grandiosity—alarming to a pragmatist\n\nDiscussing succession with María before the regency council is a serious breach of protocol\n\nDon Ramon serves Aragón, not Castile—his job is to protect Aragonese interests\n\nEven \"unity without dominance\" still threatens Aragonese independence and identity\n\nDon Guillem, Pallars, and the Bishop are already acting on conversations Don Ramon wasn't party to\n\nJuan is asking Don Ramon to trust intentions after bypassing him completely\n\nThe succession question is extraordinarily sensitive—Juan asking about it raises questions about his own ambitions\n\n\nComplicating Factor:\nDon Ramon now has the information he wanted—but what he's learned is not reassuring. Transparency is valuable, but the content of that transparency reveals a Castilian king with grand visions who has already been making private arrangements with Aragonese factions.\n\n\n\nD100 REACTION TABLE: Don Ramon de Perellós\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nDeeply Alarmed. The \"vision\" confirms his worst fears—this is Castilian absorption dressed in idealistic language. Don Ramon becomes coldly formal, offers nothing, and will immediately brief María that Juan's intentions are more ambitious than suspected. The regency council will coordinate resistance.\n16-35\nGuarded and Skeptical. Appreciates the honesty but finds the content alarming. Asks pointed, uncomfortable questions about what \"neither holding dominance\" actually means in practice. Provides minimal information about succession, citing need to consult with María first. Will not obstruct but will not help.\n36-55\nCautiously Receptive. The transparency earns some credit, but Don Ramon remains noncommittal. He acknowledges the vision without endorsing it. Answers the succession question factually but without interpretation. Suggests that any further discussions of this nature should include María and the full council.\n56-70\nProfessionally Engaged. Don Ramon recognizes that Juan's approach—however irregular—was at least honest. He provides a frank assessment of the succession situation and the factional dynamics Juan has stirred. Offers practical advice on managing the remaining Barcelona visit, though stops short of endorsing the vision.\n71-85\nGenuine Interest. Something in Juan's delivery—perhaps the admission of error, perhaps the explicit rejection of Castilian dominance—creates an opening. Don Ramon asks substantive questions about implementation, reveals some of his own frustrations with the current situation, and offers more detailed guidance. Still cautious, but engaged.\n86-95\nThoughtful Partnership. Don Ramon has spent four years managing an impossible situation—a king who won't come home, factions pulling in opposite directions, a regent with no children and an uncertain future. Juan's vision, delivered with humility, offers something he hadn't dared hope for: a path forward. He speaks frankly about Aragón's real situation and his own concerns.\n96-100\nUnexpected Alignment. Don Ramon reveals that he has privately worried about exactly these questions for years—what happens when Alfonso dies, what becomes of Aragón, whether the kingdom can survive its own divisions. Juan's transparency and vision resonate deeply. He becomes a genuine ally, offering insights and assistance beyond what protocol requires.\n\n\nShall I roll?"

Whether it is admiration or concern, he does not clarify.\n\n\nHe turns back, hands clasped behind him once more.\n\n\n\"You ask about the succession. That, at least, is a matter of law rather than vision.\" His tone is neutral, instructional—a steward explaining accounts. \"King Alfonso has no legitimate children. Queen María has borne none, and the physicians hold little hope after so many years. Should Alfonso die, the Crown of Aragón passes to his nearest male relative.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, as if waiting for Juan to complete the thought himself.\n\n\n\"The Infantes Juan and Enrique are dead. Their legitimate male issue—Carlos of Viana—is also dead. This leaves...\" He spreads his hands slightly. \"King Ferdinand of Aragón, Alfonso's father, had one other son who survived infancy. That son married into the House of Trastámara. His daughter María is our regent. His son...\"\n\n\nDon Ramon's eyes meet Juan's.\n\n\n\"His son is Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nThe words hang in the air. He lets them settle before continuing.\n\n\n\"By strict succession law, should Alfonso die without heir, the Crown of Aragón would pass to the descendants of Ferdinand's second son—that is, to Juan II of Castile. Your Majesty is, in fact, Alfonso's heir presumptive.\"\n\n\nHe says this as simple fact, without interpretation.\n\n\n\"The regency council is aware of this. The factions are aware of this. When Your Majesty speaks of 'bringing kingdoms together,' every man in Barcelona hears it through this lens.\"\n\n\nHe moves back toward the desk, straightening papers that do not need straightening.\n\n\n\"I would suggest that further discussions regarding succession—or visions of unity—include Her Majesty the Regent and the full council. These are not matters for private conversations with faction leaders and bishops.\"\n\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\n\"Is there anything else Your Majesty requires for the midday reception with the Consell de Cent?\""

Let me check the chapter summaries to figure out the current date.\n\nFrom Chapter 2.15 Summary:\n- Mid-January 1434: Departure from Toledo\n- Journey took 11 days\n- Day 7: Fraga incident\n- Day 11: Arrival in Barcelona\n- Evening Day 11: Reception, speech, conversations\n- Night: Difficult conversation with Lucia\n- Morning Day 12: Reconciliation with Lucia, painful meeting with María, successful meeting with Bishop\n\nSo we're on Day 12 of the journey, which would be approximately late January 1434 (mid-January + 12 days).\n\nIf they left Toledo mid-January 1434, let's say around January 15th:\n- January 15 + 11 days = January 26 arrival in Barcelona\n- Day 12 = January 27, 1434\n\nThey need to leave by early March for Rome. The Constantinople expedition is planned for spring 1434.\n\nFrom the chapter summaries, the fleet and 700 knights are ready. Juan needs to:\n1. Visit Rome (present Declaration of Como to Pope, etc.)\n2. Then proceed to Constantinople\n\nIf they leave Barcelona around March 1st, that gives them roughly 4-5 weeks in Barcelona from late January.\n\nLet me be more precise:\n- Mid-January departure from Toledo = ~January 15\n- 11 days travel = arrival January 26\n- Current day (Day 12) = January 27, 1434\n\nSo from January 27 to March 1 = approximately 33 days, or roughly 4-5 weeks.\n\nActually, I should check if there's more specific information about the departure date for Rome. Let me think about what was established in earlier chapters.\n\nFrom the timeline:\n- Isabel's delivery was late July/August 1433\n- The baby (Prince Fernando) was born\n- Juan married Lucia (Queen Isabel died in childbirth based on Chapter 2.11-2.13)\n\n\n- January 1434: journey to Barcelona with 700 knights\n\nI'm tracking Juan's strategic maritime expedition. He'll sail to Rome first, spending about 1-2 weeks traveling by sea. This allows him to present the Declaration of Como to the Pope and secure diplomatic support. After Rome, he'll continue to Constantinople before summer, aligning with the spring 1434 expedition plan. The timing looks precise: leaving Barcelona in early March gives him ample time to complete both critical diplomatic missions.\n\nStaying in Barcelona for roughly a month provides crucial preparation time for the complex naval journey ahead.\n\n\nGM Timeline Calculation:\n\n\nBased on Chapter 2.15:\n\n\nDeparture from Toledo: Mid-January 1434\n\nJourney duration: 11 days\n\nArrival in Barcelona: Approximately January 26, 1434\n\nCurrent day (Day 12): Approximately January 27, 1434\n\n\nThe Constantinople expedition is planned for spring 1434, and Juan must visit Rome first to present the Declaration of Como to Pope Eugenius IV personally and coordinate on various matters (Naples support for Alfonso, Military Orders, Constantinople aid).\n\n\nIf Juan aims to depart Barcelona by early March (around March 1-5), that gives him approximately 4-5 weeks remaining in Barcelona.\n\n\nThe fleet of 700 Military Order knights and the royal flagship Princess Catalina await departure. The sea voyage from Barcelona to Rome takes approximately 1-2 weeks depending on weather. From Rome to Constantinople would be several weeks more.\n\n\nSo to answer Don Ramon's implicit question: Juan has roughly five weeks before he must sail, assuming early March departure for Rome.\n\n\n\nDo you want to answer Don Ramon with this timeframe, or adjust your plans?"

And offering to discuss Castilian trade practices...\" He nods, still writing. \"That gives them something of value. Merchants appreciate practical knowledge more than promises.\"\n\n\nHe sets down the quill and turns back to face Juan and Lucia.\n\n\n\"I will inform the Consell de Cent that Your Majesty comes as a visiting sovereign, that questions regarding Aragonese succession are matters for the regency council, and that you are prepared to discuss commerce between the kingdoms in general terms.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then adds with the faintest trace of dryness:\n\n\n\"I will also prepare myself to receive many visitors this afternoon.\"\n\n\nHe gathers several documents from the desk, straightening them into a neat stack.\n\n\n\"The reception is at the Saló de Cent—the council's hall, not the palace. A short walk. I will escort Your Majesties when the bells toll noon.\" He glances toward the window, gauging the sun. \"Perhaps half an hour. Is there anything else Your Majesty requires before then?\""

Don Ramon has been helpful - surprisingly so given my NPC guidelines, but the player earned it through genuine deference and smart positioning. Let me check if Don Ramon would have any final words.\n\nDon Ramon has achieved what he wanted:\n- He now knows what Juan has been doing\n- Juan has agreed to defer succession matters to the council\n- Juan has adopted a position Don Ramon finds acceptable\n- Juan will refer merchants to Don Ramon\n\nHe might offer one small piece of practical advice before the meeting, but he shouldn't be overly helpful. The player has earned his respect, not his full allegiance.\n\nNow for the Consell de Cent meeting. I need to:\n1. Set the scene - the Saló de Cent, the hundred jurats, the atmosphere\n2. Establish who the key figures are\n3. Have them present their concerns\n4. Remember the NPC rules - they have their own agenda, they don't explain themselves, they don't help Juan without getting something first\n\nThe merchants want:\n- Assurances about their privileges\n- Information about Granada's ports and trade implications\n- To understand what \"unity\" means for their ledgers\n- Perhaps specific concessions or commitments\n\nWhat they won't say:\n- Which factions they're aligned with\n- What they've already heard from Don Guillem or others\n- Their actual bottom line\n\nLet me write the transition and set the scene for the Consell de Cent meeting.\n\n\nDon Ramon pauses at the door, one hand on the iron ring.\n\n\n\"Only this, Your Majesty.\" He speaks without turning fully. \"The consellers en cap—the five chief councillors—will speak first. They represent the five estates: citizens, merchants, artisans, artists, and laborers. The merchants' voice—Senyor Bernat Fiveller—is the loudest. But do not ignore the others. The artisans remember when Castilian competition nearly broke the weavers' guild. They have long memories.\"\n\n\nHe opens the door.\n\n\n\"I will return at noon.\"\n\n\n\nTHE SALÓ DE CENT\n\n\nThe bells of Santa Maria del Mar are still echoing across Barcelona's rooftops when Don Ramon leads Juan and Lucia through the narrow streets to the Plaça de Sant Jaume. The Saló de Cent—the Hall of the Hundred—occupies the heart of the Casa de la Ciutat, a stern stone building that speaks of civic pride and commercial power.\n\n\nInside, the hall is smaller than Toledo's throne room but no less impressive in its way. Pointed arches rise to a wooden ceiling painted in red and gold. The walls bear the arms of Barcelona—the red and gold bars of Aragón quartered with the cross of Sant Jordi. Wooden benches line the chamber in rising tiers, and upon them sit the jurats: one hundred men in dark robes and furred caps, the elected governors of one of the Mediterranean's greatest trading cities.\n\n\nAt the far end, five high-backed chairs face the chamber. The consellers en cap are already seated—five men of varying ages, their chains of office glinting in the light from high windows.\n\n\nThe hall falls silent as Juan and Lucia enter.\n\n\nA man in the central chair rises. He is perhaps sixty, with a neatly trimmed grey beard and the calculating eyes of a man who has spent a lifetime reading contracts and partners alike.\n\n\n\"Your Majesties of Castile.\" His Catalan accent is thick but his Castilian is serviceable. \"Barcelona welcomes you. I am Pere Joan de Sant Climent, conseller en cap. We are honored by your presence in our city.\"\n\n\nThe words are correct. The tone is... measuring.\n\n\n\"We understand Your Majesty has recently achieved a great victory against the Moor.\" He gestures to the assembly. \"The Consell wishes to offer its congratulations. Granada's fall is a triumph for all Christendom.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, and the pause is deliberate.\n\n\n\"We also understand that Granada's ports now fly Castilian banners. Málaga. Almería. Ports that once competed with Barcelona for the African trade.\"\n\n\nHe smiles—a merchant's smile, pleasant and unrevealing.\n\n\n\"Perhaps Your Majesty would honor us by sharing how Castile intends to... organize these new commercial opportunities?\""

Polite acknowledgment\n2. Admitted he hasn't made major decisions yet\n3. Suggested summoning traders to create a system\n4. Stated aim of increasing trade and cooperation\n5. Mentioned moving against Muslim piracy\n6. Offered that Castile could draw on Aragonese expertise\n\nThis is vague - exactly what Don Ramon warned against. The merchants will probe harder. The piracy angle is interesting but Juan hasn't offered them anything concrete. The \"expertise\" comment could be seen as flattering or as an empty gesture.\n\nI should have the conseller push for specifics while remaining polite. He represents merchants - they want concrete terms, not aspirations.\n\n\nNPC Analysis - Pere Joan de Sant Climent (Conseller en Cap):\n\n\nWhat he wants: Concrete terms—preferential access, tariff agreements, guarantees that Catalan merchants won't be squeezed out of the southern trade; something he can report to the hundred men behind him\n\nWhat he won't say: That Barcelona has already lost contracts to Genoese merchants moving into Granada; that \"cooperation\" with a larger kingdom usually means absorption; that vague promises from kings are worth less than the paper they're not written on\n\n\n\nSant Climent's expression remains pleasant, but something flickers behind his eyes—the look of a man who has just been handed a promissory note of uncertain value.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of aims and intentions. Admirable.\" He inclines his head. \"And the campaign against piracy is... welcome news. Barcelona has lost fourteen vessels to Salé corsairs in the past two years alone.\"\n\n\nHe glances briefly at the man seated to his left—a younger man with ink-stained fingers and sharp features. The merchants' representative. Senyor Bernat Fiveller.\n\n\nFiveller leans forward.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty mentions summoning traders to create a system. A worthy thought.\" His Castilian is more polished than Sant Climent's, but colder. \"Might we ask—which traders? Castilian traders from Seville, who already control the Atlantic routes? Or will Catalan houses receive equal voice in this... council?\"\n\n\nA murmur passes through the benches. Fiveller continues, his tone still courteous but pressing:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of cooperation. Of aligned interests. We hear these words and we are grateful for them.\" He spreads his hands. \"But Your Majesty will forgive us—we are merchants. We think in contracts, not sentiments. When Málaga's harbor opens to Christian trade, will a Catalan ship pay the same duties as a Castilian ship? Will Barcelona's cloth merchants have the same rights in Granada's markets as Burgos wool factors?\"\n\n\nHe pauses, letting the questions settle.\n\n\n\"These are not challenges, Your Majesty. Merely... the questions that keep merchants awake at night.\"\n\n\nFrom the artisans' chair, an older man with calloused hands speaks without rising—a breach of protocol that draws a sharp glance from Sant Climent.\n\n\n\"And what of competition, Majestic? Granada's weavers are skilled. Moorish silk is prized throughout Christendom.\" His Castilian is rougher, accented. \"If Granada's looms now serve Castile, what becomes of Valencia's silk?

He's also pointing out that he's not their king - why are they so interested in him?\n\nThis is a clever move - it puts the ball back in their court and forces them to reveal what they actually want.\n\nLet me think about what's happening here:\n\n1. The merchants are worried about competition from Granada's ports\n2. They're worried about what happens if Juan becomes King of Aragon\n3. They want concrete guarantees/commitments\n\nJuan is essentially saying: \"I don't control prices. Why are you so interested in me if I'm not your king?\"\n\nThis puts them in an awkward position because:\n- They can't openly say \"because you'll probably be our king soon\"\n- They're revealing their anxiety about the succession\n- They have to explain why they think Juan's decisions matter to them\n\nLet me think about how the NPCs would respond:\n\nSant Climent - the conseller en cap - is the political one. He'll try to smooth things over.\nFiveller - the merchants' representative - is more direct about commercial interests.\nThe artisan who spoke out of turn - he's worried about competition.\n\nLucia is also present. Juan looked at her. Should she react? The player mentioned looking at Lucia but didn't say she should speak. Let me have her give a subtle reaction but not speak unless Juan asks her to.\n\nThe question Juan asked is pointed - why does a foreign king matter so much to them? This forces them to confront the elephant in the room (succession) or admit they're being presumptuous.\n\nSant Climent will probably try to give a diplomatic answer. But Fiveller might be more blunt.\n\nWhat they want: Concrete guarantees about trade access\nWhat they won't say: That they assume Juan will be their king and are trying to lock in favorable terms now while they have leverage\n\nLet me write this scene.\n\n\nNPC Analysis - The Consell de Cent (collective):\n\n\nWhat they want: To lock in favorable terms now, while Juan needs Aragonese goodwill, before he becomes their king and no longer needs to negotiate\n\nWhat they won't say: That they're treating this as a pre-succession negotiation; that a foreign king who will likely become their king is not truly foreign; that their leverage disappears the moment Alfonso dies\n\n\n\nLucia meets Juan's glance. Her expression is calm, but there's a flicker of something—approval, perhaps, or quiet amusement. She does not speak, but her slight nod suggests: Yes. Make them say it.\n\n\nThe hall stirs. The artisan who spoke out of turn shifts uncomfortably in his seat. Fiveller's eyes narrow almost imperceptibly.\n\n\nSant Climent raises a hand, stilling the murmurs.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty asks a fair question.\" His tone is careful now, the merchant's smile replaced by something more measured. \"You are correct. You are King of Castile. Aragonese trade policy is a matter for King Alfonso and the regency council. We overstep.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. The silence stretches.\n\n\n\"And yet.\"\n\n\nHe folds his hands before him.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty will forgive us if we speak plainly. We are Catalans. Plainness is our vice.\" A small ripple of laughter from the benches, quickly suppressed. \"King Alfonso pursues his destiny in Naples. Queen María holds Aragón in trust. And the man who stands before us today is...\"\n\n\nHe stops, choosing his next words with evident care.\n\n\n\"...a man of great consequence. A man who has achieved what no Christian king has achieved in two centuries. A man whose shadow falls long across all of Iberia.\"\n\n\nFiveller cuts in, less patient than his elder.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty asks what a Castilian king could do to address our concerns. The answer is simple: nothing. Today.\" He emphasizes the word. \"But we are merchants. We plan for tomorrow. We sign contracts that bind our grandchildren. We think in generations.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to the hundred men seated behind him.\n\n\n\"Every man in this chamber knows the succession laws of Aragón. Every man knows that King Alfonso has no heir. Every man knows who stands next in line.\"\n\n\nThe words hang in the air—the thing that Don Ramon said, now spoken aloud in a hall of one hundred witnesses.\n\n\n\"We do not ask Your Majesty to make promises you cannot keep. We ask only...\" Fiveller spreads his hands, \"...to understand what kind of king you are.

Let me analyze this:\n\n**Juan's Approach:**\n1. Embraces their \"plainness\" - builds rapport\n2. Self-deprecating about pride, mentions Lucia will keep him honest\n3. Explains his trade philosophy: what increases trade most, benefits the kingdom\n4. Admits Castile's weakness in naval/trade matters compared to Aragon\n5. Mentions his fleet is at Alfonso's disposal for Naples\n6. Admits ignorance about specific trade policies\n7. Promises to seek advice from bodies like theirs\n8. Focuses on outcomes (increased trade) rather than specific commitments\n\n**NPC Analysis - How should the Consell react?**\n\nThis is a skillful non-answer. Juan has:\n- Avoided committing to anything specific\n- Flattered them by admitting Castilian weakness in their area of expertise\n- Promised consultation without promising results\n- Kept things vague while sounding reasonable\n\nThe merchants are professionals. They've heard kings promise \"consultation\" before. They want specifics:\n- Equal tariffs or not?\n- Catalan access to Granada ports?\n- Protection against Granada silk flooding their markets?\n\nJuan gave them philosophy, not contracts. Some will appreciate the humility and openness. Others will see it as evasion.\n\nI should have them push back - not rudely, but merchants don't let vague answers stand. They need something concrete to report to their guilds.\n\nLet me think about who responds:\n- Sant Climent (the elder statesman) might appreciate the diplomatic approach\n- Fiveller (the sharp merchant) will push for specifics\n- The artisan already spoke out of turn - he's worried about his livelihood\n\nI need a roll here to see how this lands. Let me draft a d100 table.\n\n**Success Factors:**\n1. Humility about Castilian naval weakness - shows he's not arrogant\n2. Fleet at Alfonso's disposal - concrete action, not just words\n\n\n3. Promise to consult bodies like theirs - acknowledges their importance\n4. Philosophy of \"what increases trade most\" - sounds reasonable\n5. Bringing Lucia and joking about her keeping him honest - humanizing\n6. Matching their \"plainness\" - cultural respect\n\nJuan's diplomatic strategy balances cultural sensitivity with strategic ambiguity. His approach demonstrates respect while avoiding binding commitments, potentially giving him flexibility in future negotiations. The Consell will likely be divided - some appreciating his openness, others demanding more concrete assurances about trade specifics.\n\nThe Catalan ships' equal duty status and subtle reference to potential succession create an underlying tension. While consultation doesn't guarantee actual power-sharing, it signals potential willingness to engage. The merchants will scrutinize these nuanced statements, seeking deeper implications beyond surface-level promises.\n\n\nNPC Analysis - The Consell's Reaction:\n\n\nWhat they want: Still waiting for specifics; philosophy is pleasant but unenforceable\n\nWhat they won't say: That \"seeking advice\" from councils means nothing if the king ignores that advice; that Castile's naval weakness is precisely why they fear absorption—a king who needs their ships has more reason to take them\n\n\n\nA murmur ripples through the benches—not hostile, but not satisfied either. Men lean toward one another, exchanging quick words in Catalan.\n\n\nSant Climent tilts his head, considering.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks well. And with... refreshing honesty about Castile's limitations.\" There's a hint of warmth in his voice now. \"We appreciate that you do not pretend expertise you do not possess.\"\n\n\nFiveller is less mollified. He taps a finger against the arm of his chair.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty says you will seek advice from bodies such as ours.

Kings do not always listen.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\n\"You say you want policies that increase trade. So do we. But whose trade? When a Castilian merchant and a Catalan merchant both want the same contract in Málaga, whose trade increases?\" He spreads his hands. \"This is not philosophy, Your Majesty. This is Tuesday.\"\n\n\nThe artisan—emboldened now—speaks again.\n\n\n\"And the silk, Majestic. You did not answer about the silk. Granada's weavers will sell cheaper than ours. They always have. Will 'increasing trade' mean Moorish silk in every market while my apprentices starve?\"\n\n\nSant Climent raises a hand, quieting the artisan, but his eyes remain on Juan.\n\n\n\"Perhaps Your Majesty might offer us something... smaller. Not a trade policy—we understand that is premature. But a gesture. A sign of intent.\" He pauses. \"When Catalan ships arrive at Málaga, will they be welcomed as friends?

Next month.\"\n\n\nSant Climent raises a hand, his expression more thoughtful than his colleague's.\n\n\n\"Senyor Fiveller speaks from... urgency. Which is understandable.\" He turns to Juan. \"But Your Majesty raises an interesting question. Such a structure does not exist—not formally. The crowns negotiate. The merchants... adapt.\"\n\n\nHe strokes his beard.\n\n\n\"Barcelona would be honored to host such a gathering, should one be arranged. It would be... good for the city.\" A pragmatist's calculation, openly stated. \"But this is a matter of years, not weeks.\"\n\n\nFiveller cuts back in, his patience visibly thinner.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I asked for a letter. A few sentences instructing your port officials to treat our merchants as equals. Not a policy. Not a treaty. A letter.\" He spreads his hands. \"Is that truly something that requires an international conference to decide?\"\n\n\nThe artisan mutters something in Catalan.

This is an opportunity to push for additional concessions.\n- What they won't say: That they're surprised Juan agreed so readily; that they're now calculating how much more they can extract; that this simple letter may actually be quite valuable\n\nThe Consell should react with:\n1. Some satisfaction that Juan agreed\n2. Immediate calculation about what else they can get\n3. But also some wariness - a king who agrees too easily might not follow through\n\nLucia drafting the letter is interesting - it shows partnership, but also means the letter will be carefully worded.\n\nThe other consellers (artisans, citizens, etc.) haven't gotten anything yet. They might try to add their concerns. The silk question was never answered. Piracy is Juan's initiative.\n\nLet me think about what they might ask for:\n- Equal treatment in ports (granted)\n- Piracy cooperation (Juan offered)\n- Protection for local industries (silk, cloth) - the artisan's concern\n- Access to Granada's markets\n- Information sharing\n- Customs rates\n\nI should have different voices chime in with different requests, and have them push for more while they can.\n\n\nThe hall stirs. Whatever the merchants expected, it was not this.\n\n\nFiveller stands frozen for a moment—a man who asked for a fish and has been handed the net. He recovers quickly, but not before Juan catches the flicker of surprise.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty is... decisive.\"\n\n\nSant Climent is already gesturing to a clerk, who scurries forward with writing materials. A small table is brought, set before Lucia. The queen seats herself with quiet grace, arranging the parchment and testing the quill.\n\n\nThe five consellers exchange rapid glances. An opportunity has opened, and they know it.\n\n\nSant Climent speaks first, his voice careful. \"If Your Majesty is inclined to address matters of mutual concern... the piracy question is indeed pressing. A statement of intent—that Castile and Aragón will cooperate against the Salé corsairs—would be most welcome.\"\n\n\nFiveller has regained his composure. \"And perhaps... clarification on customs rates? If Catalan merchants are to be treated as equals, does this extend to the duties they pay? Equal access means little if we are taxed more heavily.\"\n\n\nThe artisan sees his moment. He rises from his chair, ignoring Sant Climent's warning look.\n\n\n\"The silk, Majestic. You spoke of increasing trade. But trade in what? If Granada's silk floods our markets without restriction...\" He hesitates, searching for words. \"Can the letter say something about... balance? That Your Majesty will not permit Granada's looms to destroy Valencia's? Some protection for those who weave, not only those who trade?\"\n\n\nA fourth voice—the citizens' representative, silent until now—speaks quietly.\n\n\n\"And information, Your Majesty. When Castile makes decisions that affect our merchants, will Barcelona be informed? Consulted?

We are grateful.\" He pauses delicately. \"But I asked whether Barcelona might be consulted. These are... different things. To be informed is to learn what has been decided. To be consulted is to speak before the decision is made.\"\n\n\nFiveller, recovering his footing, adds: \"And the equal treatment—this is most welcome.

Or might all rates rise together, equally but... higher?\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands, the merchant's instinct reasserting itself.\n\n\n\"We do not doubt Your Majesty's intentions.

This city. This port.\" He gestures to the hundred men behind him. \"If Your Majesty instructs Málaga and Almería to treat Catalans as equals, this council can instruct Barcelona's harbor officials to extend the same courtesy to Castilians. Equal berthing. Equal licensing times. Equal treatment in the customs house.\"\n\n\nSant Climent nods slowly. \"That much is within our power. And we would be... willing to put it in writing. A matching commitment. Barcelona's word alongside Castile's.\"\n\n\nThe artisan looks confused—the political maneuvering has moved beyond his concerns. But Fiveller leans forward, his merchant instincts engaged again.\n\n\n\"And the trading conference. If Barcelona hosts such a meeting, we commit our resources. Our halls.

Her smile is soft, unguarded—the expression of a woman watching something she did not know she wanted until she had it.\n\n\n\"The horse is very obedient,\" she observes.\n\n\n\"The horse has no choice,\" Juan replies from somewhere near the floor. \"The king commands.\"\n\n\nCatalina steers by yanking Juan's hair. \"Now to Mama! The horse visits the brave lady!\"\n\n\nJuan crawls to Lucia's feet. Catalina leans forward precariously, nearly tumbling off, and plants a wet kiss on her stepmother's cheek.\n\n\n\"The king says the lady is pretty.\"\n\n\nLucia catches her, steadying the small body. \"The king is very kind.\"\n\n\n\"The king is always kind.\" Catalina says this with the absolute certainty of a child who has never had cause to doubt it. She pats Lucia's belly with a clumsy hand. \"Is the baby a horse or a king?\"\n\n\nInés stifles a laugh behind her needlework.\n\n\nThe afternoon sun warms the nursery. Beyond these walls, the Count of Pallars waits with his grievances, María nurses her wounded feelings, and seven hundred knights prepare to sail toward Constantinople.\n\n\nBut for now, there is only this: a king on his hands and knees, a queen in a sunlit chair, and a little girl who believes the world is exactly as it should be."

He escorts Juan and Lucia through the Palau Reial to a smaller receiving chamber—intimate, private, away from listening ears.\n\n\n\"The Count awaits within. I informed Her Majesty of the Consell de Cent's... outcome.\" He pauses. \"She expressed surprise.\"\n\n\nHe does not elaborate on what kind of surprise.\n\n\nThe door opens.\n\n\nHug Roger III, Count of Pallars Sobirà, rises from a chair by the window. He is perhaps fifty, grey-bearded, with the weathered face of a man who has spent decades managing mountain territories on the French border. His clothing is fine but not ostentatious—practicality over display.\n\n\nHis bow is correct, nothing more.\n\n\n\"Your Majesties.\" His Castilian carries the heavy accent of the Pyrenean north. \"Thank you for receiving me privately.

Complete honesty about succession - addresses the elephant in the room directly\n2. Framing it as wanting to be known/to know Aragon - not conquest but relationship\n3. Acknowledging Alfonso is still alive and hopefully will be for years - respects the current king\n4. Turning the charm accusation around - showing wit without dismissiveness\n5. Mentioning humility before God - appeals to religious values\n6. Reciprocal trade arrangements - demonstrates fairness, not exploitation\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n1. Pallars is deeply skeptical - he's seen kings make promises before\n2. The Aragonese faction fears Castilian absorption - Juan *is* the heir presumptive\n3. Juan has been \"charming\" everyone in Barcelona - could look like a calculated campaign\n4. The succession question is precisely what worries Pallars most\n5. \"Wanting to know Aragon\" could sound like reconnaissance before conquest\n6. Juan has been enabling Alfonso's Naples campaign with gold and papal influence - the opposite of what Pallars wants\n7. Alfonso being \"alive and well\" doesn't address what happens WHEN he dies\n\n\n8. Pallars' sons and nephews have died in Italian wars - this is personal\n\n**Critical Factor:**\nPallars wants to know if Juan will RESTRAIN Alfonso or ENABLE him. Juan has been enabling with gold and papal influence. This is the core issue for the Aragonese faction.\n\nI recognize the deep personal loss Pallars has experienced. His family's blood spilled in Alfonso's Italian campaigns creates a visceral, emotional barrier to trusting Juan. The potential heir's previous support of the Naples venture directly contradicts Pallars' core desire to protect Aragonese lives and resources. This personal trauma will heavily influence his reaction to Juan's honest admission.\n\n\nApproach Quality Assessment:\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nComplete honesty about succession—addresses the elephant directly rather than evading\n\n\"Aragon charming me\" deflection shows wit without being dismissive\n\nFraming as wanting to know Aragón and be known—relationship, not conquest\n\nAcknowledges Alfonso is alive and respects the current king's position\n\nReligious reference to the bishop—shows genuine spiritual dimension\n\nCorrectly identifies the questions everyone is asking—demonstrates he understands their fears\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nPallars represents men whose sons have died in Italian wars—Juan has been funding those wars\n\nThe 40,000 florins Juan sent to Alfonso enables exactly what the Aragonese faction opposes\n\n\"Hopefully for many years\" doesn't address what happens when Alfonso dies\n\nJuan's \"vision\" of unity still sounds like absorption to a man defending Aragonese independence\n\nPallars asked why Juan is working so hard to charm them—Juan deflected rather than answered directly\n\nThe succession admission confirms Pallars' suspicion: Juan is here to prepare his inheritance\n\nPallars sent a messenger to his estates at first light—he's already preparing for something\n\nThe Aragonese faction wants Alfonso to abandon Naples; Juan wants Alfonso to win Naples\n\n\nCritical Tension:\nPallars' core question remains unanswered: Will Juan help end the Italian bleeding, or continue enabling it?\n\n\n\nD100 REACTION TABLE: Count of Pallars\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nCold Rejection. The honesty about succession confirms Pallars' fears—this is a Castilian king preparing to inherit, not a potential ally. He notes pointedly that Juan's gold has funded the Italian campaign that kills Aragonese sons. The conversation becomes formal and unproductive. Pallars will report to the Aragonese faction that Juan is Alfonso's enabler, not their salvation.\n16-30\nSuspicious Skepticism. Pallars appreciates the directness but remains guarded. He presses harder: if Juan becomes king, will Aragonese sons continue dying for Naples? Will Castilian interests override Aragonese ones? The questions become pointed and uncomfortable. He offers nothing and commits to nothing.\n31-45\nGrudging Respect, No Ground Given. The honesty earns credit, but Pallars has heard kings speak of \"knowing\" realms before conquest. He acknowledges Juan's candor while making clear the Aragonese faction will judge by actions, not words. He reveals little of his own position and deflects questions about what the faction wants.\n46-60\nCautious Engagement. Pallars recognizes something different in Juan's approach—most would-be kings don't admit their ambitions so plainly. He begins to speak more openly about the Aragonese faction's concerns: the Italian bleeding, the absent king, the uncertain future. But he stops short of asking for anything or offering alliance. Testing continues.\n61-75\nFrank Discussion. The directness unlocks something. Pallars admits the Aragonese faction has discussed the succession question among themselves. He speaks plainly about what they fear and what they want—an end to Italian adventures, a king who lives in Aragón, respect for Aragonese institutions. He asks what Juan would actually do differently than Alfonso.\n76-85\nGenuine Opening. Pallars has spent years watching Alfonso pour Aragonese blood into Italian soil. A king who admits he wants to know Aragón—who asks questions rather than makes demands—offers something different. He reveals the faction's position more fully and asks pointed but constructive questions about Juan's intentions. A foundation for trust begins to form.\n86-95\nUnexpected Alignment. Pallars confesses that the Aragonese faction has privately hoped for exactly this—a potential successor who sees Aragón as more than a prize to be won. He speaks candidly about the internal politics, the tensions with the Neapolitan faction, and what it would take for men like him to support Juan's eventual succession. Something approaching alliance emerges.\n96-100\nA Soldier Finds His King. Years of frustration, grief for sons lost in Italian wars, and fear for Aragón's future crystallize in this moment. Pallars sees in Juan what he has desperately sought—a king who listens, who admits uncertainty, who treats Aragonese lords as partners rather than subjects. He commits personally to Juan's cause and offers to bring others from the faction into quiet conversation.\n\n\nShall I roll?"

I fear that Aragonese gold will continue flowing south while our mountain villages empty. I fear that when Alfonso finally falls from a Neapolitan wall or catches Roman fever, the man who inherits will see Aragón as a treasury to be raided for Castilian ambitions.\"\n\n\nHis grey eyes fix on Juan.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty has sent forty thousand florins to support Alfonso's Italian campaign. Catalan ships carry Castilian gold to fund a war that has already cost me a nephew and three cousins' sons.\" He pauses. \"So when Your Majesty speaks of wanting to know Aragón—I must ask: do you wish to know us as partners?

Pallars has been on the attack, but now he has to defend his own position. This is uncomfortable for him.\n\nThe roll was 41 - \"Grudging Respect, No Ground Given.\" So Pallars respects Juan's candor but isn't going to suddenly become an ally. He's testing, probing, not committing.\n\nWhen confronted with \"what would you do,\" he has a few options:\n1. Deflect - claim it's not his place to set policy\n2. Admit he doesn't have a perfect answer but maintain his criticism\n3. Actually propose something (withdrawal, negotiated settlement, etc.)\n\nGiven his character - a practical mountain lord, a soldier, someone who has lost family to this war - he probably has thought about this. But his \"solution\" might not be realistic either, or might involve costs he's willing to accept that others aren't.\n\nHe won't want to admit he doesn't have a good answer. But Juan has put him on the spot. A 41 roll means he's not going to suddenly open up or become an ally - he'll maintain his guarded, testing posture.\n\nLet me have him give a partial answer but not a complete one - and perhaps turn it back on Juan in some way, or reveal something about the faction's position without committing fully.\n\n\nNPC Analysis - Count of Pallars (continued):\n\n\nWhat he wants: To avoid being put on the defensive; to test whether Juan actually wants counsel or is simply scoring points\n\nWhat he won't say: That the Aragonese faction has debated this endlessly without consensus; that some want withdrawal at any cost while others merely want a king who comes home; that he doesn't have a clean answer either\n\n\n\nPallars' jaw tightens.

But that counsel comes too late by a decade.\" He turns. \"If it were mine to decide? I would negotiate. Not capitulate—negotiate. René of Anjou is not his brother. He has Provence to manage, a claim to Naples he cannot enforce alone, and less stomach for endless war than Louis had.\"\n\n\nHe folds his arms.\n\n\n\"Would he accept a white peace? No. But he might accept a partition. Alfonso keeps Calabria and Sicily. René takes Naples itself. Both claim the title, neither fights for it. It is ugly. It satisfies no one fully.\" He shrugs. \"But it stops the bleeding.\"\n\n\nHis eyes narrow slightly.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty has influence with Alfonso now. Castilian gold speaks loudly. If you counseled partition rather than total victory...\"\n\n\nHe lets the sentence hang, unfinished.\n\n\n\"But that is not what Your Majesty has done.

Reframes the gold as ending the war, not prolonging it—addresses Pallars' direct accusation\n3.

Accepts partial victory as acceptable (\"Even if he cannot take all of Naples\")\n6. Shows willingness to use his influence for what Pallars wants\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n1. \"Hopefully he will listen to me\"—uncertain outcome, not a guarantee\n2. Alfonso is notoriously obsessed with Naples; Juan's counsel may mean nothing\n3. Juan is going to Constantinople—that's a long journey, and Alfonso may not be on the way\n4. No specifics on what \"conclusion\" means—partition? Victory? Withdrawal?\n5. This is still just words; Pallars has heard promises before\n6. Juan hasn't committed to stopping the flow of gold if Alfonso refuses to conclude\n7. The Aragonese faction wants Alfonso to come HOME, not just end the war\n8. Juan frames this as \"counsel\"—advice Alfonso can ignore\n\n**Critical Question:**\nJuan has offered to counsel Alfonso to end the war. But what if Alfonso refuses? Juan hasn't addressed that. And \"hopefully\" is a weak word that Pallars will notice.\n\nThe roll of 41 in the previous exchange gave us \"Grudging Respect, No Ground Given\"—Pallars is testing, watching, not yet trusting.

Victory? Something else?\n\n\nCritical Gap:\nJuan has not addressed what happens if Alfonso refuses to listen. The word \"hopefully\" signals uncertainty that Pallars will notice.\n\n\n\nD100 REACTION TABLE: Count of Pallars\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nDismissive. \"Hopefully\" is the word of courtiers, not kings. Pallars has heard enough promises that depend on Alfonso's cooperation. He points out that men with actual leverage do not say \"hopefully\"—they say \"or else.\" Juan has gold; Juan has influence; Juan chooses not to use them as a condition. The conversation ends politely but coldly.\n16-30\nSkeptical Probing. Pallars seizes on the weakness: What if Alfonso does not listen? What then? Will Juan continue funding a war he counseled against? He presses for commitments Juan may not be willing to make, exposing the gap between intention and action.\n31-45\nGuarded Acknowledgment. The commitment to counsel Alfonso is noted but not celebrated. Pallars observes that counsel is easily ignored—especially by Alfonso. He asks pointed questions about Juan's route to Constantinople and whether he will truly have time to press the matter. Neither convinced nor dismissive.\n46-60\nCautious Interest. Pallars recognizes that Juan has moved from philosophy to something approaching a plan. He probes for details: When will Juan visit Alfonso? What specifically will he propose? Will he advocate for partition or merely \"conclusion\"? Testing whether the commitment has substance.\n61-70\nMeasured Approval. The willingness to counsel ending the war—and to accept partial victory—represents more than Pallars expected. He acknowledges this directly while noting that results matter more than intentions. He offers something in return: information about what conclusion the Aragonese faction could accept.\n71-80\nGenuine Engagement. Pallars sees a potential ally for the first time. He speaks more openly about the faction's position, the internal debates about Naples, and what it would take to bring the war to acceptable conclusion. He asks whether Juan would support a specific settlement—testing the depth of commitment.\n81-90\nStrategic Partnership. Juan's willingness to use his influence with Alfonso for Aragonese interests shifts the conversation fundamentally. Pallars proposes coordinating positions: what Juan will counsel, what the Aragonese faction will support, how to present a unified front to Alfonso. Common cause emerges.\n91-100\nFull Alignment. The honesty, the concrete commitment, and the acceptance of partial victory crystallize years of Pallars' frustration into hope. He commits to supporting Juan's eventual succession if Juan delivers on ending the Italian bleeding. He reveals faction thinking freely and offers active cooperation.\n\n\nShall I roll?"

Partition, as I suggested? Complete withdrawal? Some other arrangement?\" He shakes his head. \"Telling Alfonso 'the war must end' means nothing. He believes he is winning. He will say 'yes, it will end—when I am crowned in Naples.' That is not what we need.\"\n\n\nHe sits back.\n\n\n\"Give me something concrete, Your Majesty. A route. A timeline. A proposal. Something I can take back to men who have buried their sons.\""

He's asking for proper authorization from the regency council before speaking on Aragon's behalf.\n\nLet me assess this approach:\n\n**Success Factors:**\n1. Concrete timeline: March 1st to Rome, then to Alfonso\n2. Shows respect for Aragonese sovereignty—won't meddle without authorization\n3. Offers to carry a message/letter—a concrete service\n4. Acknowledges he holds no office in Aragon—humble, accurate\n5. Puts the ball in Pallars' court—if they want him to speak for them, they must organize\n6. Requires regency council blessing—proper channels, respects María's authority\n7. This aligns with what Don Ramon asked for earlier—going through proper channels\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n1. \"I can only speak for myself\"—limits his usefulness as an advocate\n2. Requires regency council blessing—adds bureaucratic layer\n3. Pallars may not have confidence the regency council will act\n4. María is wounded from this morning—will she cooperate?\n5. The Aragonese faction and the regency council may not be aligned\n6. This delays action—more meetings, more approvals, more time\n7. \"Deliver a letter\" is messenger work, not advocacy with personal weight\n\n**Critical Tension:**\nJuan is being politically correct and respecting sovereignty, but Pallars came here looking for someone with influence who would USE that influence. Juan is offering to be a postman rather than an advocate.\n\nHowever, this is also wise—Juan avoiding overreach, respecting proper channels, and protecting himself from accusations of meddling. It's politically savvy even if it's not what Pallars hoped for.\n\nThe roll should reflect this tension—Pallars may appreciate the propriety or be frustrated by it.\n\n\nApproach Quality Assessment:\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nConcrete timeline—March 1st to Rome, then to Alfonso; this is specific\n\nRespects Aragonese sovereignty—won't speak for Aragon without authorization\n\nAcknowledges he holds no office in Aragon—proper humility\n\nOffers to carry a letter or statement—concrete service\n\nRequires regency council blessing—aligns with what Don Ramon requested earlier\n\nPuts responsibility back on Aragonese faction to organize their message\n\nPolitically wise—protects Juan from accusations of meddling\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\n\"I can only speak for myself\"—limits his usefulness as an advocate\n\nPallars wants someone who will use influence, not just deliver mail\n\nRegency council blessing adds bureaucratic layers and delays\n\nMaría is wounded from this morning—uncertain whether she'll cooperate\n\nThe Aragonese faction and regency council may not be aligned\n\n\"Carry and deliver\" is messenger work—less than Pallars hoped for\n\nNo commitment to advocate, only to transmit\n\nPallars came seeking an ally with power; he's being offered a courier\n\n\nCritical Tension:\nJuan is being politically correct and respectful of sovereignty. But Pallars has buried family members for this war. He may want a king who acts, not one who waits for proper authorization.\n\n\n\nD100 REACTION TABLE: Count of Pallars\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nFrustrated Disappointment. Pallars wanted an ally who would use his influence; Juan offers to carry letters. The careful deference to regency council authority feels like evasion. Pallars thanks Juan for his time with cold courtesy—another king who speaks well and commits to nothing.\n16-30\nImpatient Pressing. Pallars points out that he didn't ask Juan to speak for Aragon—he asked what Juan himself would say. The retreat into proper channels feels like hedging. He pushes harder: will Juan advocate ending the war, or merely report that some Aragonese lords are unhappy?\n31-45\nGrudging Acknowledgment. The respect for sovereignty is noted, but Pallars observes dryly that sovereignty has not stopped Alfonso from ignoring his own subjects. He asks whether the regency council will actually produce such a letter, or whether this is another delay. Skeptical but not hostile.\n46-60\nCautious Acceptance. Pallars recognizes the political wisdom in Juan's approach—and that overreach would damage them both. He accepts the offer to carry a message and commits to raising the matter with the regency council. Progress, though slower than hoped.\n61-70\nThoughtful Engagement. The deference to proper channels earns respect—a king who respects Aragonese institutions may actually mean what he says about partnership. Pallars asks practical questions: how to coordinate with the regency council, what form the message should take, when it must be ready.\n71-80\nStrategic Appreciation. Pallars sees what Juan is doing—building coalition rather than acting alone. He commits to pushing the Aragonese faction to work with the regency council on a unified message. Offers information about which council members might support such an effort.\n81-90\nActive Collaboration. Juan's respect for process, combined with concrete timeline and genuine offer, unlocks Pallars' cooperation. He proposes specific next steps: meeting with Don Ramon, approaching María, drafting language. Partnership begins to take shape.\n91-100\nFull Partnership. The combination of honesty, concrete commitment, and political wisdom earns Pallars' trust. He reveals the Aragonese faction's full position, commits to marshaling support for a formal message, and offers to coordinate directly with Juan's people before March departure.\n\n\nShall I roll?"

And I will send riders to the absent council members at first light.\"\n\n\nHe pauses at the door.\n\n\n\"The Bishop's Mass tomorrow. Hour of Terce. The Cathedral of Santa Eulàlia.\" A slight inclination of his head. \"I understand Your Majesty made quite an impression on him yesterday. He has apparently cancelled all appointments to prepare his homily.\"\n\n\nHe departs.\n\n\n\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF SANTA EULÀLIA\n\n\nJanuary 28, 1434 — Hour of Terce\n\n\nThe cathedral rises from the heart of the Barri Gòtic like a prayer carved in stone. Gothic spires reach toward a winter sky, and the morning light filters through high windows, casting colored shadows across ancient flagstones.\n\n\nThe royal party processes through the great doors: Juan and Lucia, Catalina carried by Inés, the household knights in their best doublets, Don Ramon and a contingent of Aragonese officials. The pews are full—word has spread that the King of Castile attends Mass, and Barcelona's faithful have come to see.\n\n\nBishop Francesc Climent Sapera waits at the altar in full vestments. He looks... different. There is something in his bearing that was not there two days ago. A straightness to the spine. A clarity in the eyes.\n\n\nBefore the Mass begins, Juan approaches the bishop with his request.\n\n\nThe old prelate listens. His expression shifts—surprise, then understanding, then something deeper.\n\n\n\"The fallen sons of Aragón,\" he repeats quietly. \"And their families.\"\n\n\nHe is silent for a moment.\n\n\n\"Yes. Yes, I will pray for them.\" He looks at Juan with an expression that is difficult to read. \"This is... not a prayer I expected a Castilian king to request.\"\n\n\nHe turns toward the altar.\n\n\n\"But it is a prayer that is long overdue.\"\n\n\n\nRoll: 73/100 — The Mass Resonates\n\n\nThe Mass itself is... remarkable.\n\n\nBishop Climent Sapera preaches not of politics or crowns, but of service. Of the difference between power wielded for glory and power wielded for others. He speaks of Christ washing the feet of his disciples—a king becoming a servant.\n\n\nHe does not mention Juan by name. He does not need to.\n\n\nAnd when he prays for the fallen sons—reading the names of those Barcelona families have lost in Italy, names he has clearly gathered in the night—something breaks open in the cathedral.\n\n\nWeeping. Not performative grief, but the raw sound of wounds finally acknowledged.\n\n\nAn old woman in black clutches her rosary and sobs. A grey-haired man bows his head, shoulders shaking. Somewhere near the back, a young widow holds her children close.\n\n\nThe prayer continues for nearly ten minutes. Name after name. Family after family.\n\n\nWhen it ends, the silence is profound.\n\n\n\nAfterward, as the congregation files out into the morning light, Juan notices several things:\n\n\nThe Count of Pallars stands near the back of the cathedral. He was not there when the Mass began. His weathered face is unreadable, but he has not left.\n\n\nDon Guillem de Vic hovers near the doors, looking uncertain—the Naples prayer was not what the Neapolitan faction expected from their new ally.\n\n\nAnd María—Queen María—stands in a side chapel, alone, a candle flickering before her. She has been crying."

She hides behind Juan's leg, suddenly shy. The moment becomes awkward. The widow curtsies uncertainly, unsure what is expected. The gesture, though well-meant, falls flat.\n11-20\nThe widow is overwhelmed. She falls to her knees, weeping uncontrollably, unable to speak. Her daughter pulls her away protectively, apologizing profusely. Catalina is frightened by the intensity.\n21-30\nGrief becomes anger. The widow stares at Juan with hollow eyes. \"Castilian gold,\" she whispers. \"Castilian gold paid for the ships that took my boy.\" She accepts no comfort. The daughter hurries her away.\n31-45\nAwkward but gentle. Catalina offers the hug, but the widow is too stunned to respond naturally. She pats Catalina's head stiffly, murmurs thanks, curtsies. The moment is kind but constrained by the gulf between them.\n46-60\nSimple grace. The widow kneels to receive Catalina's hug. She weeps quietly. \"Thank you, little one.\" She looks at Juan with exhausted gratitude—not absolution, but acknowledgment. A small moment, honestly shared.\n61-75\nSomething breaks open. Catalina hugs the widow, then says something in her toddler way that cuts through pretense. The widow laughs through her tears. Other mourners nearby draw closer. A moment of genuine human connection.\n76-85\nThe Princesita's gift. Word spreads through the cathedral—the little princess who saved the drowning boy now comforts the grieving. The widow clutches Catalina like a lifeline. Others approach, seeking the same simple grace. The moment becomes something larger.\n86-95\nCatalina speaks. Whatever she says—in her twenty-month-old wisdom—strikes something true. The widow weeps openly, holding Catalina tight. María, watching from the chapel, covers her mouth. Pallars bows his head. A cathedral holds its breath.\n96-100\nA moment that will be remembered. Catalina does something no one expects—something that will be told and retold in Barcelona for years. The widow, the watching congregation, the cynics and believers alike—all are moved. Even grief, for a moment, gives way to grace.\n\n\nShall I roll?"

And the prayer for the fallen—\" He stops, recalibrates. \"Very moving.\"\n\n\nHe clutches a leather satchel under one arm—documents, presumably. The communications he wished to present.\n\n\n\"I have prepared the letters Your Majesty requested. Introductions to the Gualbes banking family. A framework for financial cooperation between Castilian and Catalan merchant houses.\" He pauses. \"I was not certain... that is, I did not know if today was still appropriate to discuss such matters.

Juan is asking Don Guillem a direct question - whether he agrees that we must not close our eyes to the costs of war.\n\nLet me think about Don Guillem's position:\n- He's Neapolitan faction - wants Naples to succeed\n- He publicly committed to Juan, and now the prayer for fallen sons made it look like Juan is sympathizing with the Aragonese faction\n- He's nervous about whether he backed the wrong horse\n- Juan is now reassuring him that support continues, but also asking him to acknowledge the human cost\n\nWhat does Don Guillem want? Reassurance and to feel useful.\nWhat won't he say? That his faction allies are questioning him. That he's worried he made a mistake.\n\nThe question Juan asks is a test of sorts - can Don Guillem acknowledge the cost of war while still supporting the war? This is a moment where Don Guillem has to navigate between his faction interests and basic humanity.\n\nI should have Don Guillem respond in a way that's realistic - he's a courtier, he'll try to navigate this carefully. He won't fully embrace the sentiment (that might alienate his faction) but he can't coldly dismiss it either (that would make him look heartless in front of Juan).\n\n\nDon Guillem's shoulders ease slightly at Juan's first words. The reassurance of continued aid lands where it was needed.\n\n\nBut the question that follows gives him pause.\n\n\n\"The costs of war.\" He repeats the phrase slowly, as if examining it for traps. \"Yes. Of course, Your Majesty. War is... costly.\"\n\n\nHe shifts the satchel under his arm.\n\n\n\"I confess I did not expect—\" He stops, begins again. \"The Neapolitan faction has perhaps focused on the prize. Naples. The crown. The Mediterranean trade that flows from victory.\" He glances back toward the cathedral doors. \"We speak less of the price.\"\n\n\nSomething complicated moves across his face.\n\n\n\"My own cousin died at Ponza. When Alfonso was captured.\" He says it quietly, almost to himself. \"I have not thought of him in... some time. There is always the next letter to write. The next alliance to secure. The next ship to fund.\"\n\n\nHe looks at Juan directly.\n\n\n\"You are asking if I can hold both things at once. The necessity of victory and the weight of what victory costs.\" A pause. \"I do not know if I have done so before. But I take Your Majesty's point.\"\n\n\nHe straightens, collecting himself.\n\n\n\"The letters. Shall I present them here, or would Your Majesty prefer a more private setting?\""

I should be careful here.\n\n2. **Castells** - Human towers. These have medieval origins in Catalonia, though the formalized competition came later. The tradition of ball de valencians (precursor) existed.\n\n3. **Jousting/Tournaments** - Universal medieval activity, would certainly be present.\n\n4. **Falconry** - Hunting with birds, popular among nobility everywhere.\n\n5. **Ball games** - Various forms of handball/pelota were popular.\n\n6. **Bullfighting** - Had medieval roots in Iberia, though different from modern form.\n\n7. **Religious festivals** - Saints' days, processions.\n\n8. **Markets and fairs** - Commercial activities, trade fairs.\n\n9. **Naval activities** - Barcelona is a major port, ship launches, naval displays.\n\n10. **Archery/Crossbow competitions** - Military skills displayed.\n\n11. **Music and dance** - Troubadour traditions were strong in Catalonia.\n\n12. **Correfoc** - Fire runs with devils, though I'm unsure of exact origins.\n\nLet me present a few options and let the scene progress naturally. I should also handle the letter approval briefly and then present options for the coming days.\n\n\nDon Guillem's residence is a fine townhouse near the Plaça del Rei—not ostentatious, but comfortable. Catalan practicality over Castilian grandeur.\n\n\nThe letters are well-crafted. Introductions to the Gualbes family emphasizing mutual benefit. A framework for joint ventures in the Granada trade. Careful language that commits to cooperation without surrendering leverage. Don Guillem has a merchant's instinct for contracts that serve both parties.\n\n\nJuan approves them with minor adjustments. Don Guillem's relief is palpable.\n\n\n\nTHE FOLLOWING DAYS\n\n\nBarcelona offers diversions enough for a visiting king seeking to understand Catalan ways:\n\n\nThe Drassanes — The royal shipyards where Aragonese war galleys are built. Master shipwrights would be honored to show the king who conquered Granada their craft. Juan's interest in naval matters is known.\n\n\nLa Llotja — The merchant exchange, where traders gather daily to negotiate contracts. The heartbeat of Catalan commerce.\n\n\nFalconry in Collserola — The hills above Barcelona offer hunting. Several nobles have extended invitations.\n\n\nThe Crossbow Guild — Barcelona's crossbowmen hold weekly competitions. A martial tradition the city guards jealously.\n\n\nFesta de Sant Pau — January 29th. A minor saint's day, but Barcelona celebrates with processions, music, and gegants—enormous painted figures carried through the streets.\n\n\nThe Boqueria Market — Where Barcelona feeds itself. Fishmongers, butchers, spice merchants. Catalina would find endless distractions.\n\n\nLucia reviews the options with Juan over breakfast.\n\n\n\"We cannot do everything.

Drums pound. Pipes wail. The crowd surges and cheers.\n\n\n\"Papa!\" Catalina shrieks, pointing. \"Big people! Very big people!\"\n\n\nShe insists on being held aloft to see better, then insists on being put down to dance, then insists on being picked up again when the dragon gegant passes too close and she loses her nerve.\n\n\nLucia laughs more than Juan has heard in weeks.\n\n\nThe Barcelonans notice their visitors. Word spreads through the crowd: the Castilian king, the one who conquered Granada, he came to our festival. Some press closer to see. Others offer sweets to the little princess. An old woman presses a ribbon into Catalina's hands—a blessing, she says, for la princesita de la cuerda.\n\n\nRoll: 67 — Warm Reception\n\n\nBy evening, half of Barcelona has seen the King of Castile dancing awkwardly to Catalan drums while his daughter rides on his shoulders, shrieking with delight.\n\n\nIt is not dignified. It is not regal.\n\n\nIt is perfect.\n\n\n\nTHE DRASSANES — January 30th\n\n\nThe royal shipyards smell of pitch, sawdust, and the sea.\n\n\nMaster shipwright Arnau Despujol walks Juan through the cavernous workspace where the ribs of three war galleys rise like the bones of great beasts. Catalan craftsmen labor with adze and saw, their movements practiced and precise.\n\n\n\"Thirty oars each side,\" Despujol explains, his Castilian rough but serviceable. \"Lateen sail for speed. Ram-prow reinforced with bronze.\"\n\n\nHe shows Juan innovations—a new method of joining planks that reduces leakage, a design for oar-locks that allows faster deployment.\n\n\nJuan asks questions. Detailed questions. Questions about tonnage and draft and the relative merits of nailed versus pegged construction.\n\n\nDespujol's initial wariness gives way to something approaching enthusiasm.\n\n\nRoll: 73 — Professional Respect\n\n\n\"Your Majesty knows ships,\" the master shipwright observes, surprised.\n\n\n\"I am learning,\" Juan admits. \"Castile has never been a naval power. That must change.\"\n\n\nDespujol considers this. \"If Your Majesty ever wishes to send shipwrights to study our methods...\" He shrugs. \"Barcelona's techniques are no secret to those who ask properly.\"\n\n\n\nLA LLOTJA — January 31st\n\n\nThe merchant exchange buzzes with activity—traders shouting prices, clerks scratching figures, runners dashing between stalls with messages and contracts.\n\n\nDon Guillem serves as guide, introducing Juan to the leading merchant families. The Gualbes. The Santcliment. The Marquet.\n\n\nThey are courteous. They are cautious. They watch Juan the way they watch any new factor entering their market—assessing risk and opportunity.\n\n\nRoll: 51 — Neutral Assessment\n\n\nJuan listens more than he speaks. He asks about trade routes, shipping costs, the challenges of dealing with Italian city-states. He does not promise. He does not commit. He learns.\n\n\nThe merchants take note. A king who listens is unusual. A king who asks about shipping costs is unprecedented.\n\n\n\"He is not what we expected,\" one merchant murmurs to another as Juan departs.\n\n\n\"No,\" his companion agrees. \"The question is whether that is good or bad.\"\n\n\n\nTHE CROSSBOW GUILD — February 1st\n\n\nThe guild's practice ground lies outside the city walls. Targets stand at varying distances—some stationary, some mounted on pivots to swing unpredictably.\n\n\nThe crossbowmen are proud men, veterans of city defense and occasional mercenary service. They eye Juan with professional skepticism.\n\n\n\"Does Your Majesty shoot?\" the guild master asks.\n\n\nRoll: 44 — Modest Performance\n\n\nJuan's first bolts fly true enough. He is competent—trained, as any prince must be. But the guild's champions outshoot him handily, their bolts clustering in target centers while his scatter more widely.\n\n\nHe takes the defeat with grace.\n\n\n\"I see why Barcelona's walls have never fallen,\" he observes, and the crossbowmen's skepticism softens into something warmer.\n\n\nCatalina, watching from a safe distance with Lucia and Inés, demands to try. She is given an unstrung practice bow to hold. She aims it at a pigeon and declares victory when it flies away.\n\n\n\nFALCONRY IN COLLSEROLA — February 2nd\n\n\nThe hills above Barcelona offer crisp winter air and sweeping views of the sea.\n\n\nThe Count of Cardona—whose son Bernat has become Catalina's reluctant playmate—hosts the hunt. Several Aragonese nobles attend, including, unexpectedly, the Count of Pallars.\n\n\nRoll: 62 — Civil Thaw\n\n\nPallars keeps his distance for most of the morning. But when Juan's falcon brings down a fine heron, the old count rides closer.\n\n\n\"A good kill,\" he observes. His tone is neutral—not warm, but no longer cold.\n\n\n\"The falcon did the work,\" Juan replies.\n\n\nPallars almost smiles. Almost.\n\n\n\"A modest king. Unusual.\"\n\n\nThey ride in silence for a time. Then Pallars speaks again, quietly:\n\n\n\"The council meets in four days. I have spoken with Don Ramon about the message to Alfonso.\" A pause. \"We are... drafting language.\"\n\n\nHe says nothing more. But it is more than Juan expected.\n\n\n\nTHE BOQUERIA MARKET — February 3rd\n\n\nCatalina is in paradise.\n\n\nThe market sprawls in organized chaos—fish gleaming on ice, meat hanging from hooks, pyramids of oranges and lemons, baskets of almonds and dried figs. Vendors call their wares in rapid Catalan.\n\n\n\"Papa! Fish! Big fish!\"\n\n\nShe points at a tuna nearly as large as she is.\n\n\n\"Papa! Bird! Dead bird!\"\n\n\nShe points at a row of hanging pheasants.\n\n\n\"Papa! Smell bad!\"\n\n\nShe points at the cheese stall, then covers her nose dramatically.\n\n\nLucia purchases honey cakes. Catalina devours two before anyone can stop her, then demands a third \"for the horse\"—meaning her wooden horse, back at the palace.\n\n\nThe market vendors are charmed. Word spreads. By afternoon, someone has given Catalina a small basket of candied almonds, a ribbon for her hair, and a tiny wooden cat that a craftsman carved on the spot.\n\n\n\nA LETTER ARRIVES — February 4th\n\n\nDon Ramon brings it personally.\n\n\n\"From His Majesty King Alfonso. Addressed to Her Majesty the Regent.\"\n\n\nMaría receives it in private. She does not share its contents immediately.\n\n\nBut that evening, she sends word through Don Ramon:\n\n\n\"Her Majesty wishes to inform His Majesty of Castile that the council meeting will proceed as planned. His Majesty's presence is... welcome.\"\n\n\nIt is not warmth. But the word welcome was not in her vocabulary three days ago.\n\n\n\nTHE EVE OF THE COUNCIL — February 5th\n\n\nThe absent members have arrived. Don Berenguer de Bardaxí, weathered and watchful. The Viscount of Rocabertí, proud and silent. The Bishop of Girona, rotund and thoughtful.\n\n\nBarcelona hums with tension and anticipation. Everyone knows the council meets tomorrow. Everyone knows the King of Castile will attend. Everyone wonders what will be said.\n\n\nLucia finds Juan in their chambers, watching the sunset over the harbor.\n\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" she says.\n\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" he agrees.\n\n\nCatalina sleeps in the next room, exhausted from a day of preparation—which for her meant informing Bernat that her papa would be at the council and his papa would not, a diplomatic incident that required intervention from both nursemaids.\n\n\n\"Are you ready?\" Lucia asks."

Direct address to the Viscount - facing the challenge head-on\n2. Admits the facts openly - \"It is true what you say\"\n3. Reframes the question to expose what's really being asked - shows political sophistication\n4. Explicitly affirms respect for regency council and king's authority\n5. Points to witnesses who can corroborate his statements\n6. Makes a sovereign's argument - a king doesn't need permission to write to his own officials\n7. The letter benefited Aragonese merchants - hard to argue against in substance\n8. Has not overstepped - he wrote about Castilian policy, not Aragonese policy\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n1. Rocabertí is looking for reasons to oppose, not be convinced\n2. \"I require no permission from other kingdoms\" could sound arrogant\n3. Standing up changes the dynamic - could seem like asserting dominance\n4. The argument that he \"requires no permission\" is true but may rankle those who wanted consultation\n5. María and Alfonso \"know of my ambition\" - but knowing is not approving\n6. Doesn't address that the agreements affect Aragonese interests even if they only bind Castile\n7. The core tension remains: Juan made arrangements that affect Aragón without Aragonese input\n8. Rocabertí came to oppose - logic won't move him\n\n**The key tension:**\nJuan is technically correct - he can write to his own officials about Castilian policy. But the *effect* of that policy is to shape the trading environment Aragonese merchants must operate in. Rocabertí's deeper point is about power asymmetry: Castile can set terms, Aragón must respond.\n\nLet me draft a d100 table that reflects these factors:\n\n\nApproach Quality Assessment:\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nFaces the challenge directly—stands up, addresses the Viscount personally\n\nAdmits the facts openly—\"It is true what you say\"\n\nReframes the accusation to expose what's actually being asked—politically sophisticated\n\nExplicitly affirms respect for regency council and king's authority\n\nPoints to witnesses who can corroborate\n\nSovereign's argument is legally sound—a king needs no permission to instruct his own officials\n\nThe letter benefits Aragonese merchants—hard to attack the substance\n\n\"I have nothing to hide\"—transparency as defense\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nRocabertí came to oppose, not to be convinced—logic won't move him\n\n\"I require no permission\" is true but sounds arrogant to suspicious ears\n\nStanding up shifts the dynamic—could seem like asserting dominance in María's council\n\nThe argument sidesteps Rocabertí's deeper point: Castilian policy affects Aragón whether or not Aragón consents\n\n\"María and Alfonso know of my ambition\"—knowing is not approving; may irritate María\n\nPower asymmetry remains: Castile sets terms, Aragón responds\n\nOther councillors may share Rocabertí's concerns even if they dislike his tone\n\nDoes not offer anything—pure defense, no bridge-building\n\n\n\nD100 REACTION TABLE: The Council's Response\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nRocabertí presses the attack. The sovereign argument proves his point—Castile does what it wants, Aragón must adapt. Others on the council shift uncomfortably. María's face darkens. The defense has become confirmation of their fears.\n16-30\nCold reception. The logic is unassailable but wins no friends. Rocabertí scoffs openly. Pallars and Bardaxí exchange glances. Don Guillem looks at the floor. Juan is technically correct and politically isolated.\n31-45\nGrudging acknowledgment, lingering suspicion. Don Ramon notes that the argument is legally sound. Rocabertí is not satisfied but has no counter. The council moves on, but the Viscount's point hangs in the air—Castile acts, Aragón reacts.\n46-60\nMixed response. Some councillors accept the logic; others remain skeptical. María intervenes to move proceedings forward before the debate escalates. The matter is neither won nor lost—tabled rather than resolved.\n61-70\nMeasured approval. Don Ramon or Pallars observes that the letter benefits Aragonese merchants—attacking it attacks their own interests. Rocabertí is isolated. The council accepts Juan's explanation without warmth but without hostility.\n71-80\nRespect earned. The direct address, the admission, the reframing—someone on the council (perhaps Bardaxí, perhaps the Bishop) notes that Juan could have evaded but chose honesty. Rocabertí's attack loses momentum.\n81-90\nThe tide turns. Juan's willingness to face the challenge directly, combined with the substance of what the letter actually contains, shifts the room. Don Guillem finds courage to speak in support. Even Pallars nods slightly.\n91-100\nRocabertí overplayed. The attack backfires—Juan's response exposes it as unreasonable. María intervenes to rebuke the Viscount for questioning a sovereign's right to instruct his own officials. The council moves forward with Juan's credibility enhanced.\n\n\nShall I roll?"

María herself intervenes to rebuke Rocabertí - this is significant because she has been wounded by Juan, she set strict conditions, and yet even she recognizes that Rocabertí has gone too far.\n\nThis should be a turning point in the council meeting. Let me write it with appropriate weight.\n\n\nThe silence that follows Juan's words is absolute.\n\n\nRocabertí opens his mouth to respond—\n\n\n\"Enough.\"\n\n\nMaría's voice cuts through the chamber like a blade.\n\n\nEvery head turns. The Regent has risen from her chair, the chain of office glinting in the morning light. Her eyes are fixed on the Viscount, and there is ice in them.\n\n\n\"Viscount Rocabertí.\" Her voice is controlled, precise, and utterly devastating. \"Did I hear you correctly? Did you just question a sovereign king's right to instruct his own officials in his own kingdom?\"\n\n\nRocabertí's face pales. \"Your Majesty, I merely—\"\n\n\n\"You merely suggested that the King of Castile requires our permission to govern Castile.\" María's tone could freeze the harbor. \"You have insulted a crowned monarch. In my council. Under my authority.\"\n\n\nShe lets the words hang.\n\n\n\"His Majesty of Castile came to this council as an honored guest. He accepted conditions. He has shown this body respect that—\" she pauses, and something flickers in her expression, \"—that he did not owe us. And you repay that courtesy by questioning his sovereignty?\"\n\n\nDon Berenguer de Bardaxí shifts in his chair. Even Pallars—no friend to Castile—looks uncomfortable. The Bishop of Girona studies his folded hands with intense concentration.\n\n\nRocabertí stands frozen, caught between defending himself and making things worse.\n\n\n\"The letter His Majesty wrote,\" María continues, \"instructs Castilian officials to treat Catalan merchants as equals. As equals.\" She looks around the table. \"Is there anyone here who wishes to object to that? Anyone who believes our merchants should be treated worse in Granada's ports?\"\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\n\"I thought not.\"\n\n\nShe turns to Juan. For a moment, their eyes meet. Something passes between them—not warmth, not yet, but something closer to recognition. You could have made this difficult. You didn't.\n\n\n\"His Majesty of Castile has answered the question satisfactorily.\" She sits, her bearing regal. \"The matter is closed. Don Ramon, proceed with the agenda.\"\n\n\nDon Ramon clears his throat, visibly relieved. \"The—yes. The trade agreements. Don Guillem, you may present.\"\n\n\nDon Guillem rises, his confidence restored. He begins outlining the Gualbes banking arrangements, but the room has shifted. Councillors who were watching Juan with suspicion now watch him with something else—curiosity, perhaps. Reassessment.\n\n\nThe Count of Pallars catches Juan's eye across the table.\n\n\nHe nods. Once. Barely perceptible.\n\n\nBut it is there."

Constantinople expedition\n3. Naples campaign\n\nI should show the council dynamics, the different factions, and create opportunities for Juan to potentially be drawn in or asked questions. But the player said they want to observe, so I should let the council proceed and show the various tensions and dynamics.\n\nLet me think about what each NPC would push for:\n\n**Don Guillem de Vic** - Presenting the banking agreements. He wants this to be seen as a success. He'll frame it positively.\n\n**Viscount of Rocabertí** - Just got publicly rebuked. He'll be sullen and looking for another angle of attack, but more carefully.\n\n**Count of Pallars** - He mentioned \"drafting language\" about a message to Alfonso. He'll push for this when Naples comes up.\n\n**Don Berenguer de Bardaxí** - Wants to take Juan's measure. Will ask pointed questions when appropriate.\n\n**Bishop of Girona** - Interested in Church matters, Constantinople, Juan's relationship with Rome.\n\n**María** - Running the meeting, has Alfonso's letter, will control the flow.\n\n**Don Ramon** - Procedural, keeping things moving, recording.\n\nLet me narrate the council proceedings through the three agenda items, showing the dynamics and conflicts, and creating moments where Juan might be asked to respond or contribute.\n\n\nDon Guillem presents the banking agreements with renewed confidence. The Gualbes framework establishes mechanisms for joint investment, shared risk in shipping ventures, and coordinated exchange rates between Castilian and Catalan currencies.\n\n\n\"The potential is significant,\" Don Guillem concludes. \"Granada's trade alone could generate returns of fifteen to twenty percent annually for participating houses—both Catalan and Castilian.\"\n\n\nThe Bishop of Girona leans forward. \"And the Church's interests? The tithes from this new commerce—how are they to be divided between dioceses?\"\n\n\nDon Guillem hesitates. \"That... would require further consultation, Your Excellency.\"\n\n\n\"Indeed it would.\" The Bishop makes a note. \"I trust such consultation will occur before agreements are finalized.\"\n\n\nDon Ramon records the point. \"Her Majesty, shall we note that ecclesiastical implications require separate negotiation?\"\n\n\nMaría nods. \"So noted. The trade agreements are accepted in principle, pending resolution of Church matters.\" She glances at her agenda. \"The second item. Constantinople.\"\n\n\n\nNPC Analysis — The Constantinople Discussion:\n\n\nThe mood shifts. This is not commerce—this is war, crusade, the fate of Christendom's eastern bulwark.\n\n\nDon Berenguer de Bardaxí speaks for the first time. He is perhaps sixty, with a soldier's bearing and a diplomat's careful eyes.\n\n\n\"We have heard reports that His Majesty of Castile has committed substantial forces to Constantinople's defense. One thousand knights. Sixty thousand florins.\" He pauses. \"We have also heard that His Majesty intends to travel there personally.\"\n\n\nHe does not look at Juan. He addresses María.\n\n\n\"Aragón has interests in the eastern Mediterranean. Our merchants trade in Constantinople. Our ships sail those waters.\" His voice is measured. \"If Castile commits to a major military expedition in waters where Aragonese vessels operate, this council should understand the implications.\"\n\n\nThe Count of Pallars stirs. \"And the costs. Another crusade. Another war requiring gold and men.\" His eyes flicker toward Juan, then away. \"We have experience with such ventures.\"\n\n\nMaría turns to Juan.\n\n\n\"His Majesty of Castile may speak to the Constantinople matter, if he wishes.\""

Let me assess this approach carefully.\n\n**Approach Quality Assessment:**\n\n**Success Factors:**\n1. Clear, structured presentation—three concrete options, not vague promises\n2. Realistic about limitations—\"a war that can never be won\" if Greeks won't leave and others won't commit\n3. Not asking Aragón for anything—this is informational, not a request\n4. \"I will not let my men die for a hopeless cause\"—pragmatism that resonates with men who've lost sons in Naples\n5. Acknowledges Ottoman threat affects everyone—\"Crescent banners will appear on our coasts\"\n6. Respects Greek agency—\"How they wish to continue is up to them\"\n7. Frames as Christian duty, not glory-seeking—contrast to Alfonso's Naples obsession\n8. Already addressed Pallars' concern about \"another war requiring gold and men\"—Juan is cautious, not reckless\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n1. The Aragonese faction will hear echoes of Naples—another distant war draining resources\n2. \"I will have to wait and see\"—sounds uncertain, potentially weak\n3. Bardaxí asked about implications for Aragonese interests—Juan spoke of Christian duty, not Aragonese trade\n4. No mention of coordination with Aragón—Juan acts, Aragón reacts (Rocabertí's pattern)\n5. The realistic options might sound like defeatism to some\n6. \"Only if... other Christian kingdoms are serious\"—implies Aragón should commit, indirect pressure\n7. No concrete answer about Aragonese shipping in waters where Castilian military operates\n8. The Bishop hasn't spoken yet—Church implications unclear\n\n**Key Tension:**\nBardaxí asked specifically about \"implications\" for Aragonese interests. Juan spoke eloquently about his own plans and Christian duty, but didn't directly address:\n- Will Castilian warships affect Aragonese merchant routes?\n\n\n- Will Aragón be expected to contribute?\n- What happens to Catalan traders in Constantinople during/after this?\n\nI see potential diplomatic minefields emerging. The strategy hinges on nuanced financial and maritime calculations that could easily unravel. Traders' safety and economic impact will be critical decision points for the Aragonese council. Each potential scenario carries significant risk, requiring a sophisticated probabilistic approach to assess potential outcomes.\n\n\nApproach Quality Assessment:\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nClear structure—three concrete options, not vague crusading rhetoric\n\nPragmatic realism—\"I will not let my men die for a hopeless cause\"\n\nStark contrast to Naples—cautious, conditional, with exit strategies\n\nNot asking Aragón for anything—informational, respects their sovereignty\n\nAcknowledges Ottoman threat to all Christian coasts—shared stakes\n\nRespects Greek agency—\"up to them\"\n\nAddresses Pallars' implied concern about endless wars draining kingdoms\n\nFramed as Christian duty answered, not glory sought\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nBardaxí asked about implications for Aragonese interests—Juan spoke of his plans, not their concerns\n\nNo mention of Aragonese shipping in waters where Castilian military will operate\n\n\"I will have to wait and see\"—could sound uncertain, weak\n\nIndirect pressure implied—\"other Christian kingdoms\" suggests Aragón should commit\n\nThe evacuation option may sound like defeatism to some\n\nStill the pattern: Castile acts, Aragón reacts\n\nNo concrete coordination offered—what happens to Catalan traders in Constantinople?\n\nThe Bishop's ecclesiastical concerns remain unaddressed\n\n\n\nD100 REACTION TABLE: The Council's Response to Constantinople\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nSuspicion deepens. Bardaxí notes that Juan spoke of Castilian plans but not Aragonese interests. Pallars observes this sounds like Naples with better rhetoric—Castile commits, then expects others to follow. The Bishop asks pointed questions about papal authority and crusade taxation.\n16-30\nSkeptical questioning. Multiple councillors press for specifics Juan cannot provide. What happens to Catalan merchants during military operations? Who commands in Aragonese waters? The uncertainty—\"wait and see\"—is taken as evidence of insufficient planning.\n31-45\nGrudging acknowledgment, lingering concerns. The council accepts that Juan's approach is more cautious than Alfonso's, but Bardaxí presses on Aragonese merchant interests. The matter is noted without resolution.\n46-60\nMixed reception. Don Guillem sees commercial opportunity; Pallars hears echoes of Naples; Bardaxí remains focused on practical implications. María moves to narrow the discussion to specific Aragonese concerns rather than grand strategy.\n61-70\nMeasured respect. The conditional approach—especially \"I will not let my men die for a hopeless cause\"—resonates with men weary of Alfonso's endless Italian war. Pallars asks a genuine question rather than a challenge. Dialogue opens.\n71-80\nThe contrast lands. Someone—perhaps Pallars, perhaps Bardaxí—observes aloud that this is not how Alfonso approached Naples. The caution, the exit strategies, the refusal to commit blindly. The room recalibrates.\n81-90\nGenuine engagement. The council moves from suspicion to substantive discussion. What would Aragonese participation look like, if offered freely? What coordination might benefit both kingdoms? María permits expanded discussion.\n91-100\nA door opens. The honesty, the realism, and the explicit rejection of glory-seeking strikes something deep.

Let me see how the council reacts without a roll unless the player wants one.\n\nActually the player didn't ask for a roll, so I should just continue the narrative with realistic NPC responses.\n\n\nDon Berenguer listens without expression. When Juan finishes, he is silent for a long moment.\n\n\n\"Flags.\" He nods slowly. \"Yes. Our ships carry the bars of Aragón. Castilian captains should know them.\"\n\n\nHe glances at Pallars, then back to Juan.\n\n\n\"The second and third points...\" He pauses, weighing something. \"His Majesty offers his word. Sanctuary for Aragonese subjects. Aid in evacuation. A fleet to break blockades.\"\n\n\nThe chamber is very still.\n\n\n\"These are not small promises, Your Majesty.\" His voice carries no accusation, but no warmth either. \"A king's word in a council chamber is one thing. A treaty signed and sealed is another.\"\n\n\nDon Ramon's quill hovers over his notes.\n\n\nThe Count of Pallars stirs. \"What Don Berenguer means—\" he begins.\n\n\n\"I know what I mean,\" Bardaxí interrupts, though without heat. He addresses Juan directly. \"I have commanded men in the field. I know how campaigns unfold. Promises made in palaces are forgotten when blood flows and ships burn.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands on the table.\n\n\n\"I do not doubt His Majesty's intent. But intent is not obligation. If His Majesty were willing to formalize these commitments—\" he glances at María, \"—a written undertaking, perhaps, stating that Castilian forces will extend protection to Aragonese subjects in Constantinople and provide evacuation assistance in the event of the city's fall...\"\n\n\nHe lets the suggestion hang.\n\n\nThe Bishop of Girona nods. \"Such a document would also clarify ecclesiastical jurisdiction over any Aragonese souls in His Majesty's care.\"\n\n\nMaría watches Juan, her expression neutral.\n\n\n\"The council would find written assurances... reassuring,\" she says carefully. \"If His Majesty is willing.\""

This is a reasonable request but puts the council in an awkward position.\n\nLet me think about what each NPC wants here:\n\n**María (presiding):**\n- She's trying to get commitments from Juan without committing Aragon to anything\n- Juan just flipped the script - now HE's asking for reciprocity\n- She can't commit Aragonese resources without Alfonso's approval\n- This is exactly what she didn't want - being put on the spot\n\n**Don Berenguer de Bardaxí:**\n- He wanted written assurances from Castile\n- He didn't expect Juan to ask for anything in return\n- A soldier - he understands the logic of mutual aid\n- But committing Aragonese ships means committing Alfonso's resources\n\n**Count of Pallars:**\n- He's been pushing to END wars, not start new commitments\n- Even a commitment to \"aid evacuation\" could drag Aragon into conflict\n- But he also can't argue against protecting Aragonese merchants\n\n**Viscount of Rocabertí:**\n- Already embarrassed from earlier\n- Will likely oppose anything that looks like entanglement with Castile\n\n**Don Guillem de Vic:**\n- Sees opportunity for cooperation\n- But his faction is the Neapolitan faction - they want resources for Naples, not Constantinople\n\n**Bishop of Girona:**\n- Concerned about ecclesiastical matters\n- Reciprocal arrangements are outside his primary concern\n\nThe key tension: Juan has just asked them to commit something. They wanted his commitment for free. Now they have to either:\n1. Accept reciprocity (which means committing Aragonese resources)\n2. Refuse reciprocity (which looks hypocritical - they want protection but won't offer it)\n3. Claim they can't commit without Alfonso\n\nOption 3 is most likely - María will say she cannot commit Aragonese forces without the king's approval. But this creates an awkward situation because Juan just offered his commitment freely.\n \nI anticipate a strategic deflection. The council will craft a response that appears cooperative while avoiding concrete obligations, likely emphasizing the need for royal approval and further deliberation.\n\n\nNPC Analysis — The Council's Reaction to Reciprocity:\n\n\nMaría:\n\n\nWhat she wants: Juan's commitment without Aragonese obligation; to avoid binding Alfonso to anything\n\nWhat she won't say: That she cannot commit Aragonese ships without Alfonso's approval; that Juan has just outmaneuvered her\n\n\nDon Berenguer de Bardaxí:\n\n\nWhat he wants: Protection for Aragonese merchants without entangling Aragón in eastern wars\n\nWhat she won't say: That the logic of reciprocity is sound but inconvenient\n\n\nCount of Pallars:\n\n\nWhat he wants: To end wars, not create new commitments that could drag Aragón into another conflict\n\nWhat he won't say: That he respects the move even as it complicates things\n\n\n\nThe chamber shifts.\n\n\nDon Berenguer's jaw tightens almost imperceptibly. He asked for a written commitment and received one—along with a request he did not anticipate.\n\n\nMaría's composure holds, but something flickers behind her eyes. She glances at Don Ramon, who has stopped writing.\n\n\n\"His Majesty raises a fair point,\" Don Ramon says slowly, his voice carefully neutral. \"Reciprocity is... customary in such arrangements.\"\n\n\nThe Viscount of Rocabertí, silent since his humiliation, seizes the opening. \"Reciprocity? His Majesty asks us to commit Aragonese ships to a war in the East? After everything we have heard about the cost of foreign adventures?\"\n\n\nPallars raises a hand, quieting him. His weathered face is thoughtful.\n\n\n\"His Majesty did not ask for ships in war,\" he says quietly. \"He asked for aid in evacuation. These are different things.\" He looks at Juan. \"Though the line between them can blur when Ottoman galleys are involved.\"\n\n\nThe Bishop of Girona folds his hands. \"The Church's position on mutual Christian aid is clear. We are obligated to assist fellow believers in peril. But obligation in principle and obligation in treaty are...\"\n\n\nHe trails off.\n\n\nMaría sits very still. The trap is elegant—if she refuses reciprocity, she appears to want Castilian protection without offering anything in return. If she accepts, she commits Aragonese resources without Alfonso's approval.\n\n\n\"This council,\" she says finally, \"cannot commit the Crown of Aragón to military obligations without the King's consent.\"\n\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\n\"However.\"\n\n\nThe word draws every eye.\n\n\n\"If His Majesty is willing to sign a document pledging Castilian protection for Aragonese subjects in Constantinople...\" She chooses her words with care. \"This council can recommend to King Alfonso that Aragón offer reciprocal assistance. A recommendation is not a commitment. But it carries weight.\"\n\n\nDon Berenguer nods slowly. \"A letter from this council, urging His Majesty King Alfonso to formalize mutual aid in the event of Constantinople's fall. Attached to His Majesty of Castile's signed undertaking.\"\n\n\nMaría looks at Juan.\n\n\n\"Is this acceptable? Your commitment now, and our strong recommendation to the King—delivered alongside the other matters we shall communicate to him regarding this council's deliberations?\""

He's identified that his original approach could put Alfonso in an awkward position - arriving with Castile already committed and a council recommendation essentially forces Alfonso's hand. This looks like pressure rather than partnership.\n\nInstead, Juan is proposing:\n1. He won't sign now\n2. He'll discuss directly with Alfonso\n3. They sign together\n4. The council can write a letter with their considerations\n\nThis demonstrates:\n- Respect for Alfonso's sovereignty\n- Understanding of the pressure dynamic\n- Willingness to wait rather than lock in advantage\n- Trust-building with both the council and Alfonso\n\nHow should the council react?\n\nMaría: This actually relieves her of a difficult position. She couldn't commit without Alfonso but was being maneuvered toward it. Juan just released her from that trap voluntarily.\n\nPallars: This is exactly what he asked for earlier - Juan consulting Alfonso rather than forcing his hand. This proves Juan meant what he said.\n\nBardaxí: His practical concerns about Aragonese merchants remain, but the approach is honorable. A soldier respects another who doesn't press unfair advantage.\n\nDon Ramon: The administrator sees clean process - two kings negotiate directly, council provides input but doesn't overstep.\n\nBishop of Girona: Proper order observed, ecclesiastical matters can be addressed when Alfonso is involved.\n\nRocabertí: Even he will struggle to find fault with this. Juan is voluntarily giving up leverage.\n\nDon Guillem: His faction wanted Castilian commitment to continue. This delays things but preserves the relationship.\n\nThe key insight is that Juan just did something unusual - he had leverage and chose not to use it. He could have pressed for commitment now and put Alfonso in a corner. Instead, he's treating this as a partnership discussion.\n\nThis should land well. Let me think about the range:\n\nSuccess factors:\n- Demonstrates respect for Alfonso's authority\n- Shows Juan meant what he said about consultation\n- Releases María from an impossible position\n- Models partnership rather than dominance\n- Addresses Bardaxí's concerns through proper channels\n\n\n- Consistent with Juan's stated approach throughout\n\nPotential challenges emerge that could undermine his strategic move. Some might perceive his restraint as weakness or indecision. The council's desire for quick resolution gets delayed, and skeptics like Rocabertí might still find grounds for criticism. Bardaxí's practical merchant concerns remain unaddressed for now.\n\nHowever, given the previous diplomatic breakthrough and Juan's nuanced political wisdom, this approach is likely to be well-received. The move represents a sophisticated de-escalation that builds consensus without forcing confrontation.\n\n\nThe chamber falls silent.\n\n\nMaría stares at Juan. For a long moment, her composed mask slips—not into anger or suspicion, but something closer to surprise.\n\n\nDon Berenguer de Bardaxí leans back in his chair. His soldier's eyes study Juan with frank reassessment.\n\n\n\"His Majesty of Castile,\" he says slowly, \"has just voluntarily surrendered an advantage.\"\n\n\nPallars makes a sound that might be a laugh, quickly suppressed. \"He has.\"\n\n\nDon Ramon sets down his quill. In twenty-three years of Aragonese politics, he has rarely seen a king choose not to press leverage when he had it.\n\n\nThe Bishop of Girona clears his throat. \"This is... an honorable approach. Two sovereigns negotiating as equals, signing together. The proper order of things.\"\n\n\nEven Rocabertí has nothing to say. His mouth opens, then closes. There is no angle of attack here—Juan has offered to wait, to discuss, to treat Alfonso as a partner rather than a fait accompli.\n\n\nMaría finds her voice.\n\n\n\"You would have had us in a corner.\" She says it plainly, without accusation. \"Castile committed, the council recommending, Alfonso with no graceful way to refuse.\"\n\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\n\"And you chose not to.\"\n\n\nThe word chose carries weight.\n\n\nDon Ramon gathers himself. \"Then the matter of Constantinople shall be noted as follows: His Majesty of Castile will discuss mutual protection of subjects with King Alfonso directly. This council will prepare a letter outlining our considerations and concerns for His Majesty to carry.\" He looks around the table. \"Is this acceptable?\"\n\n\nNods around the chamber. Even Rocabertí inclines his head, though he looks as if he has bitten something sour.\n\n\nMaría's eyes remain on Juan.\n\n\n\"The third item,\" she says quietly. \"Naples.\"\n\n\nThe room tenses.

Others believe we should support the campaign to its conclusion. For twelve years, we have done neither—sending gold and men while wringing our hands.\"\n\n\nHe looks around the table.\n\n\n\"Don Ramon and I have attempted to draft language that this council might actually agree upon. Language that speaks truth without ultimatum. That honors the King's sacrifices while acknowledging the kingdom's exhaustion.\"\n\n\nHe picks up the document.\n\n\n\"With Her Majesty's permission, I will read it.\"\n\n\nMaría nods, her face very still.\n\n\nPallars reads:\n\n\n\n\"To His Majesty Alfonso, by the Grace of God King of Aragón, Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia, and Sicily, Count of Barcelona—\n\n\nYour Majesty's faithful council, assembled in Barcelona under the regency of Her Majesty Queen María, sends greeting and dutiful affection.\n\n\nWe have watched with admiration as Your Majesty pursues the crown of Naples. Your courage at Ponza, your perseverance in adversity, and your recent victories in Calabria bring honor to the House of Aragón.\n\n\nYet we must speak plainly, as loyal subjects are obligated to do.\n\n\nTwelve years of war have cost this kingdom greatly. The treasury is strained. The noble houses have given sons who will not return. The merchants who fund Your Majesty's campaigns grow weary. The people pray for their King to come home.\n\n\nWe do not ask Your Majesty to abandon the field in dishonor. We ask only this: that Your Majesty consider what victory requires, and whether that price remains within the kingdom's power to pay.\n\n\nIf Naples can be won swiftly, we shall rejoice. If Naples requires another decade of blood and gold, we ask Your Majesty to weigh whether the crown is worth the cost of the kingdom that must wear it.\n\n\nWe remain Your Majesty's faithful servants, and await your wisdom.\"\n\n\n\nPallars sets down the document.\n\n\nThe chamber is silent.\n\n\nDon Guillem's face has gone pale.

The letter criticizes her husband's life's work, but also represents what many in Aragón feel. She must balance loyalty to Alfonso with her duty to the kingdom she's been managing for four years.\n\n**Don Ramon** - He helped draft this.

He might support the letter but his credibility is damaged.\n\n**Don Berenguer de Bardaxí** - A soldier and diplomat.

He shifts in his chair, his face a mask of carefully controlled distress.\n\n\n\"The letter is... eloquent.\" He chooses his words like a man walking through broken glass. \"But I wonder if 'swiftly' is not already within reach. His Majesty's recent victories—Calabria turning to his banner, Queen Joanna's envoys—\"\n\n\n\"Queen Joanna has sent envoys before,\" Pallars interrupts, his voice flat. \"Twice she has offered adoption. Twice she has revoked it. Joanna's word is written in sand.\"\n\n\n\"The situation is different now—\"\n\n\n\"The situation has been 'different now' for twelve years, Don Guillem.\" Pallars does not raise his voice, but something in his tone silences the younger man. \"My nephew's bones lie in Italian soil. Three cousins' sons. How many more until the situation is 'different enough'?\"\n\n\nDon Berenguer de Bardaxí clears his throat.\n\n\n\"The letter does not demand withdrawal.\" His soldier's precision cuts through the tension. \"It asks the King to weigh costs against gains. That is not unreasonable. That is what any commander must do.\"\n\n\nThe Bishop of Girona nods slowly. \"The Church teaches that a just war must have reasonable hope of success. The letter merely asks His Majesty to assess whether that hope remains.\"\n\n\nRocabertí stirs—then stops. He glances at María, remembering his earlier humiliation. Whatever he meant to say, he swallows it.\n\n\nDon Ramon speaks carefully. \"The draft is before the council. Do we debate the language, or the question of whether to send any message at all?\"\n\n\nAll eyes turn to María.\n\n\nShe has not moved since Pallars finished reading. Her hands rest on the table, perfectly still. Her face is porcelain—beautiful and unreadable.\n\n\n\"This letter asks my husband to consider abandoning his life's work.\" Her voice is quiet. \"The crown he has fought for since before our marriage.

I have watched the treasury dwindle and the noble houses grow restless.\"\n\n\nShe looks at Pallars.\n\n\n\"The letter is not wrong.\"\n\n\nDon Guillem makes a small sound—protest or despair.\n\n\nMaría raises a hand.\n\n\n\"I did not say I would sign it. I said it is not wrong.\" She looks around the table. \"This council must decide. I will not override you. But neither will I cast my voice until I have heard all others.\"\n\n\nShe turns, almost imperceptibly, toward where Juan and Lucia sit.\n\n\n\"His Majesty of Castile has indicated he will meet with King Alfonso. He has offered to carry messages from this council.\" Her eyes meet Juan's. \"Perhaps His Majesty has thoughts on how such a message might be received.

He asked Juan once before to use his influence, and Juan declined to be a hammer. Now Juan offers the same thing in different words: I will see for myself. I will counsel if needed.\n\n\n\"One year.\" Pallars repeats it flatly. \"His Majesty believes the war can be won in one year.\"\n\n\n\"I said Alfonso believes this,\" Juan clarifies. \"I said I will assess with my own eyes.\"\n\n\nDon Guillem seizes on the hopeful thread. \"If the war is effectively won—if Your Majesty sees that Naples is within reach—then surely this letter becomes unnecessary. We would not ask the King to abandon victory at the threshold.\"\n\n\nDon Berenguer de Bardaxí shakes his head slowly. \"We have stood at the threshold before, Don Guillem.

His Majesty carrying only the Constantinople considerations and the council's general regards.\"\n\n\nMaría looks around the table.\n\n\n\"Is this acceptable?

Juan is listening to see if there's any other business. Let me think about what the NPCs might want to raise, or if María will simply close the proceedings.\n\nThe agenda items were:\n1. Trade cooperation - concluded\n2. Constantinople - concluded\n3. Naples - concluded\n\nMaría asked if there's any other business. Let me think about what each NPC might want:\n\n**Rocabertí:** Humiliated earlier, might want to raise something to regain face, but probably smart enough not to push his luck\n\n**Pallars:** Got what he wanted with the letter. The Mass, the reciprocity gesture, and now Juan's promise to assess Naples personally - he's been slowly warming. Probably satisfied for now.\n\n**Don Guillem:** Defeated on the Naples vote. Might want to raise something commercial to salvage the day, but probably too deflated.\n\n**Don Berenguer:** Practical soldier, got his assurances on Constantinople. Probably satisfied.\n\n**Bishop of Girona:** Had questions about ecclesiastical matters that were tabled. Might want to ensure they're addressed.\n\n**Don Ramon:** Procedural - might note items that need follow-up.\n\n**María:** Wants to close on her terms, maintain dignity after the Naples vote which essentially rebuked her husband.\n\nThe most likely outcome is that the council concludes without major new business. Perhaps a small procedural matter or the Bishop noting the church matters need follow-up. This would be a natural ending point where Juan has emerged well - not triumphant, but respected.\n\nLet me write a scene where the council wraps up, giving Juan an opportunity to make a closing gesture if he wishes.\n\n\nThe chamber stirs. Councillors shift in their seats, the tension of the Naples vote slowly dissipating.\n\n\nThe Bishop of Girona clears his throat.\n\n\n\"The ecclesiastical matters regarding trade—the division of tithes from new commerce. These remain unresolved.\" He glances at Don Guillem. \"I would ask that the council note this for future discussion. Before any agreements are finalized.\"\n\n\nDon Ramon nods, making a note. \"So noted. The Church's interests in commercial arrangements to be addressed in subsequent negotiations.\"\n\n\nDon Berenguer de Bardaxí straightens his papers. \"The Constantinople undertaking—the letter of considerations for His Majesty to carry. Who drafts it?\"\n\n\n\"I will prepare a draft for the council's review,\" Don Ramon replies. \"Her Majesty will approve the final text before it is sealed.\"\n\n\nMaría nods.\n\n\nSilence falls. The business appears concluded.\n\n\nThen Pallars speaks, his voice rough.\n\n\n\"One matter.\"\n\n\nThe chamber stills.\n\n\nThe old count does not rise. He looks at the table before him, his weathered hands flat against the oak.\n\n\n\"His Majesty of Castile came to this council as a guest. He accepted conditions that no sovereign was obligated to accept. He answered challenges with patience. He offered commitments and then—\" he pauses, \"—declined to press advantage when he might have.\"\n\n\nHe looks up, his grey eyes finding Juan.\n\n\n\"I have been in councils for thirty years. I have seen kings bluster and threaten and demand. I have seen precious few listen.\"\n\n\nHe does not smile. His face remains stern, unreadable.\n\n\n\"I would have the record note that the King of Castile conducted himself with honor in these proceedings.\"\n\n\nDon Ramon's quill scratches. The other councillors are silent—some surprised, others thoughtful.\n\n\nMaría watches her brother.\n\n\n\"Is there any other business?\" she asks again, her voice softer now."

Any materials he is to carry should be ready before that date.\"\n\n\nDon Ramon bows. \"It will be done, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nThe formal tension begins to dissolve. Councillors gather their papers.

For what you said about the war being nearly won. It is more than some would offer.\"\n\n\nBefore Juan can respond, Pallars passes by.

This is significant - she's reaching out after the difficult conversation earlier in the week, after the council meeting where Juan conducted himself honorably, and after the emotional Mass where she was seen crying.\n\nI need to think about what María wants from this conversation:\n- What she wants: To understand her brother; to process her feelings about the succession; to find some peace with the situation; perhaps to repair the relationship damaged earlier\n- What she won't say: Whether Alfonso's letter contained anything about Juan specifically; the depth of her loneliness governing alone; her fears about her own future\n\nLet me write Lucia's gracious exit and then set up the garden scene, stopping when María speaks so the player can respond.\n\n\nLucia rises from her chair with quiet grace.

He's given a concise, philosophical answer about how advantage creates conflict.\n\nLet me think about María's state of mind:\n- She was hurt by Juan earlier (Chapter 2.15) when he came with plans already formed and treated her as an audience, not family\n- The council went well - Juan conducted himself with honor\n- Pallars publicly noted Juan's honorable conduct\n- Juan voluntarily surrendered advantage multiple times\n- She's the regent, managing a kingdom for an absent husband\n- She has no children after years of marriage\n- Her husband is obsessed with Naples\n- She just watched the council vote to send a letter essentially asking Alfonso to consider abandoning his life's work\n\nWhat does María want right now?\n- To understand if Juan is genuine or just politically skilled\n- To process her own complicated feelings about her husband, her brother, and her position\n- Perhaps to connect as family, not as rulers\n- To express something she couldn't express in the council chamber\n\nWhat won't she say directly?\n- How lonely and exhausted she is\n- Her fears about what happens if Alfonso never comes home, or dies in Italy\n- Whether she blames herself for having no children\n- How much Juan's earlier slight actually hurt her\n\nThis should be an intimate, vulnerable moment between siblings - but María is guarded by nature and by necessity. She won't open up easily.\n\n\nMaría is still for a long moment.\n\n\n\"Conflict.\" She repeats the word softly. \"I have spent four years managing conflict. Between the factions. Between what Alfonso wants and what the kingdom can give. Between what I am told to do and what I know must be done.\"\n\n\nShe turns from the fountain. Her face, so carefully composed in the council chamber, shows something rawer now. Exhaustion. Uncertainty. Something that might be grief.\n\n\n\"You hurt me, Juan. When you first came.\" She holds up a hand before he can speak. \"I know. Lucia told me you understood. That you learned. I watched you prove it today—with the Consell, with Don Ramon, with the council itself.\"\n\n\nShe moves to a stone bench and sits, her hands folded in her lap.\n\n\n\"But I need to understand something.\"\n\n\nShe looks up at him, and for a moment she is not the Regent of Aragón. She is his sister. A woman in her thirties, childless, governing a kingdom for a husband who may never return, watching her brother build an empire while she holds together what remains.\n\n\n\"You speak of unity. Of kingdoms joining to become something new. Of neither holding dominance.\" Her voice is quiet. \"But you are King of Castile. Conqueror of Granada. Heir presumptive to this throne I sit upon in Alfonso's absence.\"\n\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\n\"If Alfonso dies—when Alfonso dies—you will have everything. Castile. Aragón. Perhaps Naples, if his war succeeds. The largest Christian kingdom since Charlemagne.\"\n\n\nHer eyes search his face.\n\n\n\"What happens to me, Juan? In this vision of yours.

Thirty-four years, and no one thought to ask.\" She shakes her head slowly. \"I cannot imagine it. Even in Ferrara, even as a political piece to be moved on a board, I knew what I wanted. I wanted out. I wanted to matter to someone. I wanted...\"\n\n\nShe turns back to him.\n\n\n\"I wanted what you gave me. A partnership. A purpose that was mine to choose.\"\n\n\nShe crosses back to him, taking both his hands.\n\n\n\"María does not yet know what she wants. But you gave her something today that may be worth more than an estate or a governorship.\"\n\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\n\"Permission.\" Lucia's voice is gentle. \"Permission to want something for herself. Permission to take time. Permission to find an answer that might not fit neatly into anyone's plans.\"\n\n\nShe leans up, kissing his cheek.\n\n\n\"That is not nothing, husband. That is everything.\"\n\n\nFrom the corner, Catalina's voice rises in triumph: \"See, Inés? The horse jumped over the WHOLE FORTRESS. Now the almond cake.\""

      "say": "Thought process: Calibrated historical mortality rates and constructed comprehensive survival mechanics.\n\nThe player is asking me to make a roll to determine if Catalina survives childhood. This is a serious request about historical realism in the campaign.\n\nLet me think about historical child mortality rates in 15th century Europe:\n\n- Infant mortality (first year) was approximately 20-30%\n- Childhood mortality (ages 1-5) was another 20-30%\n- Overall, roughly 40-50% of children died before age 5\n- Royal children had somewhat better survival rates due to better nutrition and care, but still faced significant risks\n- Common causes: infectious diseases, dysentery, smallpox, plague, measles, accidents\n\nCatalina was born January 28, 1432, and is currently about 2 years old (January 1434). She was described as being born healthy despite the traumatic birth (roll: 96/100 at birth).\n\nThe player wants a single comprehensive roll that determines if she survives childhood (typically defined as up to age 12-14 in this period).\n\nGiven:\n- She already survived a traumatic breech birth (roll 96)\n- She is described as healthy and thriving\n- She is royalty with access to better care\n- But medieval childhood was still extremely dangerous\n\nI should create a realistic d100 table that reflects:\n1. The baseline danger of medieval childhood\n2. Her healthy birth as a positive factor\n3. Royal status providing some protection\n4. But also the reality that even royal children frequently died\n\nHistorical context: Looking at royal families of this era:\n- Many kings lost multiple children in infancy/childhood\n- Isabella of Castile (historical) lost children\n- Royal families often had many children partly because so many died\n\nA realistic table might look like:\n- 1-15: Death in childhood (illness, accident, epidemic)\n- 16-25: Near-death experience but survives with lasting effects\n- 26-40: Survives but with a serious illness along the way\n- 41-100: Survives childhood\n\nThis would give roughly 15% mortality, which is actually lower than historical averages for commoners but reasonable for royalty with good care. Some might argue it should be higher.\n \nI'll refine the mortality calculation, considering her exceptional birth circumstances. Her 96/100 healthy birth suggests robust health and resilience. I'll adjust the survival odds to reflect her strong start, creating a nuanced table that balances historical risks with her individual advantages. The goal is a realistic representation that honors both the harsh realities of medieval childhood and Catalina's specific potential for survival.\n\n\nI understand. This is a serious matter that deserves historical realism.\n\n\nHistorical Context:\n\n\nChild mortality in 15th century Europe was devastating. Even among royalty with access to better nutrition and care:\n\n\nApproximately 25-30% of children died before age 5\n\nAnother 10-15% died between ages 5-15\n\nCommon causes: smallpox, measles, dysentery, plague, fevers, accidents, infected wounds\n\nRoyal children had advantages but were not immune—many kings and queens buried multiple children\n\n\nFactors in Catalina's Favor:\n\n\nBorn healthy despite traumatic breech birth (Roll: 96/100)\n\nRoyal household with access to physicians\n\nRobust and energetic temperament as described\n\nParents attentive and loving\n\n\nFactors Against:\n\n\nMedieval medicine cannot treat most childhood illnesses\n\nTravel exposes her to disease (she has already traveled extensively)\n\nNo understanding of hygiene or contagion\n\nEpidemics strike without warning or prevention\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: Catalina's Survival to Adulthood\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-8\nDeath in early childhood (ages 2-5). Fever, pox, or epidemic claims her. The healthy birth could not protect against what medicine cannot treat.\n9-15\nDeath in later childhood (ages 6-12). Illness or accident. She lives long enough to be remembered, mourned deeply.\n16-22\nSurvives, but with permanent effects. A serious illness leaves lasting damage—scarring, weakened constitution, or other affliction that shapes her life.\n23-35\nSurvives a serious illness. A frightening episode—weeks of fever, a bout of pox—but she recovers fully.\n36-100\nSurvives childhood healthy. Fortune and constitution carry her through to adulthood.\n\n\nThe healthy birth roll (96) has already been factored into this table by giving her better odds than a typical medieval child. A commoner's child would face 40-50% mortality; Catalina faces roughly 15%.\n\n\nShall I roll?"

Intelligence: 87 - **Brilliant.** Exceptional mind. Could match scholars in debate if permitted.\n\n2. Temperament: 76 - **Commanding.** Natural authority. People follow her without knowing why.\n\n3. Special Talent: 34 - **Horsemanship.** Born to the saddle.\n\n4. Piety: 7 - **Indifferent.** Goes through motions. Faith is politics, nothing more.\n\n5. Beauty: 70 - **Beautiful.** Draws eyes. Poets will write verses.\n\nThis is a fascinating combination. A brilliant, commanding, beautiful princess who is an excellent horsewoman but has essentially no genuine faith. This is going to be interesting given Juan's deep religiosity and the spiritual themes of the campaign.\n\nLet me write this up compellingly.\n\n\nCATALINA TRASTÁMARA — PRINCESS OF CASTILE\n\n\nIntelligence: 87 — Brilliant\nCatalina possesses an exceptional mind. She will learn to read before her fourth birthday, master Latin by eight, and by twelve will be correcting her tutors' grammar. She grasps complex political situations intuitively, remembers conversations verbatim, and asks questions that make grown men uncomfortable. Her father's advisors will learn to watch their words around her—the princess is always listening, always thinking.\n\n\nTemperament: 76 — Commanding\nThere is something in her bearing that makes people defer. Not arrogance—something quieter, more natural. Servants straighten when she enters a room. Other children follow her lead without being asked. She does not demand obedience; she simply assumes it, and the assumption is rarely challenged. The girl who said \"No. Catalina helping\" while holding a rope grows into a woman who expects to be obeyed because she has never experienced otherwise.\n\n\nSpecial Talent: 34 — Horsemanship\nBorn to the saddle. Her pony Hidalgo is only the beginning. By adolescence, she will ride with the best cavalry officers in Castile and outpace most of them. She feels the horse beneath her as an extension of herself—its moods, its limits, its potential. Hunts, tournaments, even battlefields if permitted—she is never more alive than on horseback.\n\n\nPiety: 7 — Indifferent\nAnd here is the shadow.\n\n\nCatalina will learn the prayers. She will attend Mass. She will make the correct gestures at the correct times. But faith—the burning certainty that drives her father, the quiet devotion that sustains her stepmother—does not kindle in her. God is a word, not a presence. The Church is politics dressed in vestments. She will never say this aloud, not clearly, but Juan will see it. In her eyes during prayer. In the mechanical quality of her devotions.\n\n\nFor a king who has built his reign on divine purpose, who stripped naked before a pope to offer everything to God, who wrestles with messianic thinking and spiritual pride—this daughter will be a particular kind of heartbreak.\n\n\nShe is everything he might have hoped for.\n\n\nExcept this.\n\n\nBeauty: 70 — Beautiful\nShe grows into genuine beauty—not the legendary kind that launches armadas, but the kind that draws eyes across crowded halls, that makes young nobles stammer and forget their prepared speeches. Dark hair like her mother Isabel, something of Juan's intensity in her gaze, features that soften Isabel's plainness into something striking. Poets will write verses. Ambassadors will report her beauty to foreign courts. It will be a tool she learns to use early and well.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nCatalina Trastámara — Princess of Castile, heir to the Reconquista's legacy.\n\n\nA brilliant, commanding, beautiful horsewoman who goes through the motions of faith without feeling its fire.\n\n\nHer father's daughter in so many ways.\n\n\nAnd not at all in the one that matters most to him.\n\n\n\nThis will create fascinating tension as she grows. Shall we continue with María's visit, or address any other matters before the departure for Rome?"

She finds neither.\n\n\n\"I... brought ensaïmadas,\" María says. \"For Catalina.\"\n\n\n\"AUNT MARÍA!\"\n\n\nThe small voice erupts from across the room. Catalina has abandoned her guard post and is charging toward the door with the unstoppable momentum of a cavalry assault.\n\n\n\"I guarded them! The pastries! No one ate them! I was VERY NOBLE!\"\n\n\nShe collides with María's skirts, wrapping her arms around the queen's legs.\n\n\nMaría looks down at the small face beaming up at her.\n\n\nSomething in her expression cracks."

Many ships!\"\n\n\nAnd there are. Dozens of vessels crowd the harbor—fishing boats and merchant carracks, sleek war galleys with their oars shipped, fat-bellied traders from Genoa and Venice and places beyond. The banners of a dozen nations flutter in the breeze.\n\n\nMaría reins up beside them, her eyes on the water.\n\n\n\"I used to come here as a girl,\" she says quietly. \"Before I was married.

Sharing it at the palace\n4. The family dynamics and María continuing to open up\n\nThis is a gentle, character-building scene. No need for rolls - it's just family time.\n\n\nTHE RIDE BACK\n\n\nThe party descends from Montjuïc as the afternoon sun slants golden across the harbor. Catalina has declared herself satisfied with the ships—she has counted them twice, disagreed with her own count, and settled on \"very many\" as the official number.\n\n\n\"Papa. Crostata now?\"\n\n\n\"Soon, cariño.\"\n\n\n\"How soon?\"\n\n\n\"When we find a baker.\"\n\n\n\"There is a baker.\" She points at a random building.\n\n\n\"That is a blacksmith.\"\n\n\n\"There is a baker there.\"\n\n\n\"That is a church.\"\n\n\n\"Churches have crostatas?\"\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\nMaría laughs—a real laugh, unguarded and warm.

The baker's wife nearly faints when she realizes who has entered her establishment.\n\n\n\"Your—Your Majesties—I—the shop is not—we are not prepared for—\"\n\n\n\"We would like a crostata,\" Juan says simply. \"Your largest, if you please.\"\n\n\nThe woman stares. Her husband emerges from the back, flour on his hands, and stares as well.\n\n\n\"A whole one?\" the wife manages.\n\n\n\"A whole one. We are very hungry.\"\n\n\nCatalina nods solemnly to confirm this.\n\n\nThe crostata is produced—golden-brown, glistening with honey, studded with almonds. It is not the refined work of a palace kitchen. It is better. It is real.\n\n\nJuan pays twice what it is worth. The baker's wife weeps and tries to give it back. Juan refuses. Catalina waves goodbye and tells them their shop smells \"very nice, like Inés's hair but sweeter.\"\n\n\n\nTHE PALACE — LATE AFTERNOON\n\n\nThey gather in María's private chambers rather than the formal apartments—smaller, warmer, less like a throne room. Cushions and chairs pulled close together. The crostata set on a table between them. No servants. No ceremony.\n\n\nCatalina has claimed a position on María's lap, which María accepted with an expression of stunned wonder, as if a wild bird had landed on her hand.\n\n\n\"You must take the first piece, Aunt María,\" Catalina instructs. \"Because you are the queen here. Then Papa, because he paid. Then Mama. Then Catalina.\" She pauses. \"Then Catalina again, if there is more.\"\n\n\n\"That seems fair,\" María says, her voice slightly hoarse.\n\n\nShe cuts the first piece. Her hands tremble only a little.\n\n\nThey eat. The crostata is sweet and sticky and imperfect and wonderful. Catalina gets honey on her chin, her fingers, somehow on her forehead. She chatters about ships and horses and whether fish know they are wet.\n\n\nAt some point, María's arm settles around Catalina's small body—not stiffly, not formally, but naturally. As if it belongs there.\n\n\nLucia meets Juan's eyes across the room.\n\n\nThis, her expression says. This is what she needed.\n\n\nWhen the crostata is gone—Catalina did indeed have a second piece, and a third—the little princess's energy finally fades. She slumps against María's chest, eyelids drooping.\n\n\n\"Aunt María?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, little one?\"\n\n\n\"You are not so sad anymore.\"\n\n\nMaría is quiet for a long moment. Her hand strokes Catalina's hair.\n\n\n\"No,\" she whispers. \"No, I am not so sad anymore.\"\n\n\nCatalina nods, satisfied, and falls asleep.\n\n\nMaría looks at Juan over the child's head. Her eyes are bright.\n\n\n\"Thank you,\" she mouths silently."

María races Lucia along the coastal road—and wins, laughing breathlessly, looking for a moment like the girl who once dreamed of faraway places.

Veterans of the Granada campaign, most of them. Men who stormed the walls of Málaga and Loja, who stood in the breach at Alhama, who watched the Sultan's banner fall over the Alhambra.\n\n\nNow they prepare for a longer journey.

But have we not been here before? Have we not overcome hunger and pain? Yes! we have. We know what to do as well. We lack supplies, so we aquire more. We are sick, so we tend to our brothers until we are better. And when we are ready to move out, when we are ready to go on this incredible journey, only then we will leave.\n\n\nWhen I met the Greek delegation in Basel, they had given up all hope. No-one was going to help them. No-one had the courage, the will, the determination. No-one but the sons of Castille!\n\n\nWe go where no-one else dared journey. We face what no-one else dared face. We fight for what everyone else seems to have forgotten. We know that when we raise our swords in the name of Christ, we serve a higher purpose.\n\n\nI draw my sword. The sword of my father.\n\n\nI stand before you today on the first day of this incredible journey to speak the words. Words that have carried us over blood-soaked fields and towards victory.\n\n\nI point my sword towards the heaven.\n\n\nNon nobis Domine!\n\n\nRead NPC guide.md\ndraft a d100 table to see how they react."

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed speech's rhetorical strengths against soldiers' dire material circumstances.\n\nThe user wants me to draft a d100 table for the soldiers' reaction to Juan's speech. Let me analyze this speech according to the NPC guide principles.\n\n**Approach Quality Assessment:**\n\n**Success Factors:**\n1. Juan armored himself - shared identity, he's one of them, a soldier\n2. References the Granada campaign - shared history, shared suffering, shared victory\n3. Acknowledges current problems directly - \"tired, sick, maybe even hungry\" - doesn't pretend\n4. Normalizes the hardship - \"Such is the fate of knights and soldiers\"\n5. Reminds them they've overcome this before - builds on sunk costs positively\n6. Practical solutions mentioned - acquire supplies, tend to sick, wait until ready\n7. Gives them special identity - \"sons of Castille\" who go where no one else dares\n8. The banner is there - symbol of their shared past\n9. Draws his father's sword - personal, symbolic, connects to legacy\n10. \"Non nobis Domine\" - the crusader's prayer, their prayer, from the Granada campaign\n11. Doesn't blame anyone for the problems\n12. Speaks to higher purpose - exactly what demoralized soldiers need\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n1. The men are genuinely sick and hungry - words don't cure fever or fill bellies\n2. Constantinople is not Granada - it's further, stranger, more hopeless\n3. Some may feel this is just rhetoric - they've heard speeches before\n4. The supply and command problems remain unaddressed in practical terms\n5. Order commanders are still feuding - the speech doesn't resolve this\n6. Sixty men in infirmary tents - some may die before departure\n7. Rumors about Greek betrayal won't disappear from one speech\n8. The sick Santiago knight and others like him - will power alone can't sustain them\n\n**The Roll of 15 for their state means they're in rough shape:**\nThis was \"Troubled\" - supply issues, low morale, sickness. The speech has to work harder because of this baseline.\n \nThese veterans carry deep memories of past campaigns. Their connection to Juan runs deeper than mere words. The prayer \"Non nobis Domine\" isn't hollow rhetoric, but a battle cry etched in their collective experience from previous victories. While their current condition is dire, their shared history suggests resilience might overcome immediate challenges.\n\n\nApproach Quality Assessment:\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nFull armor—Juan presents himself as a soldier among soldiers, not a distant king\n\nThe white banner—shared symbol, shared memory of Granada's victories\n\nAcknowledges current problems directly—\"tired, sick, maybe even hungry\"—does not pretend\n\nNormalizes hardship—\"Such is the fate of knights and soldiers\"\n\nReminds them they have overcome before—Granada was also hard at the beginning\n\nPractical framing—supplies will be acquired, sick will be tended, departure when ready\n\nElevates their identity—\"sons of Castile\" who go where none else dare\n\nThe Greek delegation's despair—positions them as the only hope\n\nHis father's sword—personal, dynastic, connects to legacy\n\n\"Non nobis Domine\"—the Granada prayer, their prayer, calls on shared sacred memory\n\nDoes not blame anyone for the failures—no scapegoats, no recriminations\n\nHigher purpose explicitly invoked—they serve Christ, not just a king\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nWords do not cure fever or fill empty bellies—the problems remain\n\nConstantinople is not Granada—farther, stranger, more hopeless in reputation\n\nSome men may see rhetoric where they need solutions\n\nThe Order commanders' feud is unaddressed—structural problems persist\n\nSixty men in infirmary tents—some will hear this through canvas, too sick to stand\n\nRumors of Greek treachery will not vanish from one speech\n\nThese men are veterans—they have heard speeches before, they judge by results\n\nThe sick Santiago knight swaying in ranks—courage alone cannot sustain flesh\n\n\n\nD100 REACTION TABLE: The Knights' Response\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nSilence. The words land on exhausted men and sink without trace. A few voices answer \"Non nobis Domine,\" but ragged, scattered. The sick knight collapses. The men see their condition reflected in his fall. Morale does not break further, but it does not lift. They will follow orders. Nothing more.\n11-25\nGrudging acknowledgment. The response comes—\"Non nobis Domine\"—but muted, tired. The veterans remember Granada, but Constantinople feels different. Doubt lingers. The speech bought time, not belief. Juan will need to solve the practical problems quickly, or the words will curdle into resentment.\n26-40\nSteadied, not stirred. The men straighten. The prayer rises with more strength. The Granada veterans remember what this banner means. But the younger knights, the sick, the hungry—they need more than memory. The rot is halted, not healed. A foundation to build on, if Juan acts swiftly.\n41-55\nRekindled embers. Something answers in the men—pride, perhaps, or shame at their own doubt. \"Non nobis Domine\" rises with force. The sick knight remains standing through sheer will. The Order commanders glance at each other differently. The problems remain, but the spirit to face them has returned.\n56-70\nThe fire catches. The response is strong, unified. Men who were slumping stand tall. The banner snaps in the wind and they see it again—really see it, as they saw it at Granada. The feuding commanders set aside their grievances, at least for now. These men will march.\n71-85\nGranada remembered. The prayer thunders across the field. Veterans weep openly—not from despair, but from recognition. This is why they followed him. This is what they nearly forgot. The sick knight's voice rises with the rest, fever be damned. The men remember who they are.\n86-95\n\"We are the sons of Castile.\" The response shakes the air. Men pound sword hilts against shields. The infirmary tents hear it and voices rise from within—the sick joining as they can. Something has been forged anew. These men will follow Juan to Constantinople. To hell. To wherever he leads.\n96-100\nThe Spirit descends. What happens next will be spoken of for generations. The prayer becomes a roar, then a hymn, then something beyond words. Men fall to their knees not from weakness but from overwhelming purpose. The sick Santiago knight stands straighter than he has in days. This is no longer an army. It is a crusade reborn.\n\n\nShall I roll?"

The men respond, but without conviction. Juan has bought time, but the practical problems remain and must be addressed quickly or resentment will build.\n\nLet me write this scene with appropriate weight - the men are exhausted, sick, doubting. They respond because discipline demands it, because some part of them remembers Granada, but the fire isn't there. This is realistic - words alone don't cure fever or fill bellies. Juan will need to follow this with action.\n\n\nThe wind carries the words across the field.\n\n\nFor a moment—a long, terrible moment—there is only silence.\n\n\nThen, from somewhere in the Santiago ranks, a voice answers: \"Non nobis Domine.\"\n\n\nAnother joins. Then another. The response spreads—but slowly, unevenly, like fire struggling to catch in wet kindling. \"Non nobis Domine, non nobis, sed nomini tuo da gloriam.\"\n\n\nIt is not the thunder of Granada. It is not the roar that shook the walls of Málaga or echoed through the Alhambra's halls.\n\n\nIt is tired men doing what they have been trained to do. Speaking words they remember because their bodies remember, even when their hearts are uncertain.\n\n\nThe sick Santiago knight mouths the prayer, but no sound comes. His neighbor grips his arm to keep him upright. Across the field, faces remain gaunt, eyes hollow. They heard the speech. Some part of them responded to it.\n\n\nBut Juan can see the truth.\n\n\nThese men are not restored. They are steadied—barely. The bleeding has stopped, but the wound remains open.\n\n\n\nCaptain Robles steps close as the prayer fades into the February wind.\n\n\n\"They answered, Your Majesty.\" His voice is low, meant only for Juan. \"That is something.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"But they need more than words now. They need to see the supply wagons arrive. They need to see the sick recover. They need to see that someone is solving the problems, not just acknowledging them.\"\n\n\nHe looks out over the ranks—the white tabards, the crosses of three Orders, the faces of men who conquered Granada and now wonder if Constantinople will be their grave.\n\n\n\"You have bought time, Your Majesty. Perhaps a week. Perhaps less.\" His jaw tightens. \"What would you have me do?\"\n\n\n\nFrom the edge of the field, Lucia watches. Catalina is quiet in her arms, thumb in her mouth, sensing that something did not go as hoped.\n\n\nThe Order commanders remain at the front of their contingents. The Santiago captain's scarred face is unreadable. The Calatrava veteran stares at the ground. The Alcántara sergeant looks at Juan with something that might be hope, might be doubt.\n\n\nThe white banner ripples overhead, waiting to see if it will fly over victory or failure."

Sickness - bad water or tainted provisions, 60 men in infirmary, 3 dead\n2. Supply issues - spoiled meat from Valencia, replacement delayed\n3.

A table dominates the center, covered with supply manifests, maps, and the detritus of a troubled expedition. The canvas walls snap in the wind.\n\n\nJuan enters still in armor. Captain Robles follows, then the three Order commanders file in behind.\n\n\nThey do not sit. No one has offered, and the tension in the air does not invite comfort.\n\n\n\nNPC Analysis — The Order Commanders:\n\n\nCommander Rodrigo de Cervantes (Santiago) — Scarred face, forty years old, veteran of a dozen campaigns\n\n\nWhat he wants: To clear Santiago of blame for the camp placement; to establish his Order's primacy in the expedition hierarchy\n\nWhat he won't say: That his quartermaster did choose the camp site near the bad water; that he fears being scapegoated\n\n\nCommander Íñigo de Mendoza (Calatrava) — Missing two fingers, grey-bearded, proud\n\n\nWhat he wants: To protect his quartermaster's reputation; to ensure Calatrava receives equal honor and resources\n\nWhat he won't say: That the spoiled meat was accepted without proper inspection due to haste; that he is ashamed\n\n\nSergeant-Commander Vasco de Orozco (Alcántara) — Exhausted, youngest of the three, representing a smaller contingent\n\n\nWhat he wants: Finally to be heard; the equipment his men were promised weeks ago; respect from the larger Orders\n\nWhat he won't say: That Alcántara has considered withdrawing from the expedition entirely; that his men feel like afterthoughts\n\n\n\nCaptain Robles closes the tent flap.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty. Commanders.\"\n\n\nSilence. The three men eye each other like wolves sharing a kill—allies in name, rivals in truth.\n\n\nCommander Cervantes speaks first, his scarred face rigid.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty's speech was stirring. But speeches do not fill bellies or cure fevers.\" He pauses. \"If we are to address problems, let us begin with who created them. Calatrava's quartermaster accepted meat that a blind man could smell was rotten—\"\n\n\n\"Santiago's camp placement put us downstream from a tanner's waste,\" Mendoza snaps. \"My men did not poison the water. Yours did.\"\n\n\n\"If either of you had listened to Alcántara's concerns three weeks ago—\" Orozco begins.\n\n\n\"Alcántara has one hundred men,\" Cervantes cuts in. \"This is not your expedition to command.\"\n\n\nThe tent erupts."

They should still have their own agendas and tensions, but Juan is trying to get them focused on solutions.\n\nLet me think about what each commander would say:\n\n- Cervantes (Santiago): Might know about hospitals in Barcelona, might be reluctant to admit weakness by sending men away from camp\n- Mendoza (Calatrava): Might see this as an opportunity to appear helpful, or might be defensive\n- Orozco (Alcántara): Might have useful information since he's been overlooked and possibly paying attention to details others missed\n\nCaptain Robles would likely have practical knowledge too.\n\nThe NPC guide says they shouldn't be too helpful without getting something, but Juan is asking a practical question about logistics.

Let me think about what a realistic supply situation would look like for 700 knights (now ~640 able-bodied plus 60 sick) embarking on a major sea voyage.\n\nFor a medieval army/expedition:\n- Daily consumption: bread/hardtack, salted meat or fish, wine, cheese, dried legumes, olive oil\n- For sea voyage: preserved foods - hardtack (ship's biscuit), salted pork/beef, dried fish, wine (often safer than water), dried fruits, cheese, olive oil, vinegar, dried beans/peas\n- Water would be taken in barrels but goes bad quickly\n\nThe problems mentioned:\n1. A shipment of preserved meat from Valencia arrived spoiled\n2. Replacement shipment delayed (perhaps another week)\n3.

We were told to wait.\" Bitterness edges his voice. \"We waited.\"\n\n\nCervantes has the grace to look uncomfortable.

A sea journey from Barcelona to Rome—ten days to two weeks, depending on weather. Then Rome to Naples, if Your Majesty visits King Alfonso. Then onward to Constantinople—another three weeks, perhaps a month, with stops for water and provisions.\"\n\n\nHe sets down the manifest.\n\n\n\"We need, at minimum:\n\n\nSalted meat: Four hundred barrels. We have sixty-three. The Valencia shipment was to provide two hundred—all spoiled. The replacement is delayed.\n\nShip's biscuit: Six hundred crates. We have four hundred. Sufficient if we resupply in Rome.\n\nDried fish: Two hundred barrels. We have one hundred twenty.\n\nWine: Eight hundred casks. We have six hundred. Sufficient.\n\nDried legumes and grain: Three hundred sacks. We have two hundred.\n\nOlive oil and vinegar: Adequate.\n\nFresh water barrels: The ships carry these. That is the fleet's concern, not ours.\"\n\n\nMendoza finally speaks, his pride still wounded but his duty overriding it.\n\n\n\"The meat is the crisis. Without it, men weaken. Weak men sicken.

The papal court inflates prices for everything. But the markets there are vast—we can find what we need if we pay.\" He taps Naples. \"Here is better. Alfonso's army has established supply lines.

Not as good as Castilian, but it keeps.\"\n\n\nCervantes grunts acknowledgment.\n\n\n\"Sicily,\" he adds, grudgingly cooperating. \"If we stop there. Messina has warehouses.

Resupply there for Naples. Resupply in Naples for Constantinople. We stretch our coin further and reduce the risk of another spoilage.\"\n\n\nRobles calculates silently, lips moving.\n\n\n\"If we reduce our Barcelona requirement to... one hundred fifty barrels of salt meat instead of four hundred... combined with what we have...\" He nods. \"Achievable. Tarragona alone might provide that within a week.\"\n\n\nHe looks up at Juan.\n\n\n\"I can dispatch riders within the hour, Your Majesty. And send word ahead to Rome and Naples to prepare provisions for our arrival.\" A pause. \"We would need letters of credit. The Gualbes banking arrangements Don Guillem negotiated—they could facilitate payments in Rome and Naples without carrying chests of gold aboard ship.\"\n\n\nMendoza and Cervantes exchange a glance. For the first time since entering the tent, they are not glaring at each other.\n\n\n\"This could work,\" Mendoza admits.\n\n\n\"If we do not delay further,\" Cervantes adds. \"Every day in camp is another day for fever to spread.\""

We have moved the latrine trenches and forbidden use of the contaminated stream. But the men are wary. Some have been drinking only wine for days.\" He pauses. \"Clean water barrels from the city would help. A visible sign that the problem is solved.\""

Sick men - hospital accommodation\n2. Food supplies - sending riders for meat, resupply along the way\n3. Full rations while in camp\n4. Equipment for Alcántara\n5. Command structure - giving them a day to choose or he appoints\n6. Fresh water\n\nNow the commanders need to react to Juan's ultimatum about command structure. This is a significant moment - he's forcing them to cooperate or he'll make the decision for them.\n\nLet me think about how each commander would react:\n\n**Cervantes (Santiago)** - The largest Order, probably thinks he should command. But Juan's ultimatum forces him to negotiate or risk losing control entirely.\n\n**Mendoza (Calatrava)** - Proud, experienced, but has the spoiled meat problem hanging over him. Might be willing to accept a subordinate role for his quartermaster if his own command is preserved.\n\n**Orozco (Alcántara)** - Youngest, smallest contingent, has been overlooked. Probably knows he won't be chosen as overall commander, but might angle for the quartermaster position as a way to ensure Alcántara isn't forgotten.\n\nThe tension is that Juan has given them agency - but with a deadline. They either cooperate or lose control of the decision.\n\nI should write their reactions and then ask what else Juan wants to address before ending the meeting.\n\n\nThe tent falls silent.\n\n\nThe three commanders stand frozen, processing what Juan has just done. He has not chosen between them—which would have created a winner and two resentful losers. He has not imposed an outsider—which would have united them in indignation. He has told them to solve it themselves, or have the decision taken from their hands.\n\n\nIt is elegant. And uncomfortable.\n\n\nCommander Cervantes recovers first. His scarred face works through several expressions before settling on grudging respect.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty is wise to give us time.\" The words come carefully. \"Santiago will... confer with the other Orders.\"\n\n\nCommander Mendoza's jaw tightens, but he nods.\n\n\n\"Calatrava concurs. One day. We will present a unified recommendation.\" He glances at Cervantes—not with hostility now, but with the calculating look of a man preparing to negotiate. \"Or we will accept Your Majesty's judgment.\"\n\n\nCommander Orozco says nothing, but something flickers in his exhausted eyes. For the first time in this expedition, Alcántara's voice will matter. Cervantes and Mendoza need his support—or at least his non-opposition—to present any \"unified\" recommendation.\n\n\nThe balance of power has shifted, if only slightly.\n\n\nCaptain Robles permits himself a small nod.\n\n\n\"I will arrange the fresh water barrels, Your Majesty.

Inspecting latrines and improving hygiene\n\nLet me create a d100 table for this.\n\n**Factors in Juan's Favor:**\n1. He has established good relations with María - she will likely help\n2. The Bishop of Barcelona is favorable to him after their spiritual conversation\n3. The Consell de Cent just agreed to cooperation - they may assist\n4. He has money to spend\n5. He's personally invested - not delegating but doing\n6. The Hospital de la Santa Creu is run by the Church, which favors him\n7. Concrete, practical actions rather than just speeches\n8. Don Ramon can facilitate arrangements\n\n**Factors Against:**\n1. Time pressure - this is a lot to do quickly\n2. Barcelona's resources are not infinite\n3. The Aragonese may resent feeding a Castilian army\n4. Camp hygiene improvements take time to show results\n5. The sick may be too far gone to recover quickly\n6.

The hospital is full; they can take only twenty men. María's resources are stretched thin. Water barrels arrive but too few. The fever claims two more lives overnight. Progress, but painfully inadequate.\n11-25\nPartial success. The hospital accepts the sick, but grudgingly. María provides extra rations, not a feast. Water arrives late. The latrines improve marginally. Problems are addressed, not solved.\n26-40\nAdequate progress. Hospital takes all sixty. María arranges decent provisions—meat, bread, wine—but not lavish. Fresh water flows. Hygiene improves. The bleeding stops. Recovery begins slowly.\n41-60\nSolid gains. Hospital welcomes the sick; physicians are optimistic. María provides generously—roasted meats, good bread, Catalan delicacies. Camp conditions improve visibly. Men begin to believe.\n61-75\nStrong success. The hospital treats Juan's request as an honor. María opens stores freely—a feast arrives by evening. Fresh water, clean latrines, new drainage. The camp transforms. Morale lifts palpably.\n76-90\nRemarkable turnaround. Everything falls into place. The hospital's best physicians attend the sick. María personally oversees provisioning—Barcelona's finest for Castile's knights. The camp becomes a model of order. Men speak of their king with renewed pride.\n91-100\nBeyond expectation. The city embraces the cause. Hospital, merchants, even common citizens contribute. The feast becomes a celebration—Barcelona honoring the men who saved Granada. The sick begin recovering within days. The expedition is reborn.\n\n\nShall I roll?"

Fresh water, clean latrines, new drainage. The camp transforms. Morale lifts palpably.\n\nI should write this out in detail, showing Juan's personal involvement, María's help, and the positive results across all the areas he's trying to address.\n\n\nTHE LONG DAY\n\n\nFebruary 28, 1434 — Afternoon into Night\n\n\n\nTHE HOSPITAL DE LA SANTA CREU\n\n\nThe hospital's prior, Father Bernat Metge, receives Juan in the stone courtyard where patients once walked during the Black Death. The building is vast—arched cloisters, clean wards, the smell of herbs and lye soap rather than rot and despair.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty does us honor.\" Father Bernat bows deeply. \"The knights who conquered Granada are heroes of Christendom. How could we refuse them?\"\n\n\nWithin two hours, carts begin transferring the sick from the muddy camp to clean beds with fresh linens. The hospital's physicians—experienced men who have treated everything from plague to sword wounds—examine each patient with professional efficiency.\n\n\n\"The fever is not plague,\" the chief physician reports to Juan. \"Waterborne, likely. With rest, clean water, and proper care... most will recover. A week, perhaps two.\"\n\n\nThe sick Santiago knight who stood through Juan's speech is among those carried in. He grips Juan's arm as he passes.\n\n\n\"Non nobis Domine,\" he whispers. His voice is weak, but his eyes are clear.\n\n\n\"Non nobis,\" Juan replies. \"Rest now. Constantinople will wait.\"\n\n\n\nTHE PALACE — MARÍA'S RESPONSE\n\n\nMaría listens to Juan's request without interruption.\n\n\n\"You need to feed seven hundred men. Not just feed them—feast them.\" She tilts her head. \"This will cost a fortune.\"\n\n\n\"I will pay.\"\n\n\n\"You will not.\" Her voice is firm. \"These men defended Christendom at Granada. They go now to defend it at Constantinople. Aragón can spare a feast for such a cause.\"\n\n\nShe summons Don Ramon.\n\n\n\"Open the palace stores. Send word to the Boqueria—we need roasted meats, good bread, wine, fruit, whatever can be gathered by nightfall. This is not charity. This is honor.\"\n\n\nDon Ramon bows and departs.\n\n\nMaría looks at Juan.\n\n\n\"You are not the only one who can take care of family, brother.\"\n\n\n\nTHE CAMP — TRANSFORMATION\n\n\nThe afternoon becomes a blur of activity.\n\n\nWater: Fresh barrels arrive from the city on a train of carts—clean mountain water from Barcelona's cisterns. The contaminated stream is marked with warning posts. Men drink deeply, gratefully, for the first time in days.\n\n\nLatrines: Juan inspects them personally. The sight of a king examining drainage trenches spreads through the camp like wildfire. Within hours, soldiers who had grown complacent are digging new trenches, relocating the old ones downhill and away from the water supply. A Calatrava sergeant who served at Granada takes charge, organizing work parties with renewed purpose.\n\n\n\"If His Majesty can stand in shit,\" one knight mutters, \"so can we.\"\n\n\nDrainage: The camp's lowest areas—where mud has pooled and tents have grown damp—are abandoned. New positions are established on higher ground. It is hard work, but men who were listless that morning find energy they did not know they had.\n\n\n\nTHE FEAST — Evening\n\n\nAs the sun sets over Barcelona, carts roll into camp.\n\n\nRoasted pork. Lamb. Fresh bread still warm from the ovens. Wheels of Catalan cheese. Almonds and dried figs. Casks of good wine—not the thin camp stuff, but proper Aragonese red.\n\n\nThe men gather around fires that burn brighter than they have in weeks.\n\n\nThere are no speeches. No ceremony. Just food, wine, and the slowly returning warmth of men who had begun to forget what it felt like to be valued.\n\n\nCommander Cervantes finds Juan near one of the fires.\n\n\n\"The men are asking who arranged this,\" he says quietly.\n\n\n\"Her Majesty the Regent.\"\n\n\nCervantes nods slowly.\n\n\n\"They should know that. They should know Aragón stands with them.\"\n\n\nHe moves off to spread the word.\n\n\n\nNIGHT\n\n\nJuan returns to the palace exhausted, still wearing armor that has accumulated mud from latrine inspections and dust from supervising water deliveries.\n\n\nLucia meets him at the door of their chambers.\n\n\n\"You smell like a stable,\" she observes.\n\n\n\"Worse, probably.\"\n\n\nShe helps him remove the armor, piece by piece.\n\n\n\"The camp?\"\n\n\n\"Better. Not healed. But better.\"\n\n\n\"María told me what she did. The feast.\"\n\n\n\"She did not have to.\"\n\n\n\"No.\" Lucia sets aside a gauntlet. \"She wanted to.\"\n\n\nFrom the nursery, the sound of Catalina's voice, singing something tuneless and sweet as Inés puts her to bed.\n\n\n\"The commanders meet tomorrow,\" Juan says. \"They must choose a single leader.\"\n\n\n\"Will they?\"\n\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\nLucia kisses his forehead.\n\n\n\"You did what you could today. More than most kings would do.\" She pulls him toward the bed. \"Tomorrow will come soon enough.\"\n\n\n\nThe camp sleeps with full bellies for the first time in weeks. The sick rest in clean hospital beds. Fresh water flows. The latrines no longer poison the stream.\n\n\nThe crisis is not over. But the bleeding has stopped.\n\n\nTomorrow, the commanders must decide who leads beneath Juan.\n\n\nAnd in three days, God willing, the fleet will sail.\n\n\n\nShall we proceed to the commanders' meeting the next day?"

Beyond the window, Barcelona lies quiet under winter stars. Somewhere in the camp, seven hundred men sleep with full bellies. Somewhere in the hospital, sixty sick knights rest in clean beds.\n\n\nAnd here, in this small room, a princess sleeps with her wooden horse watching over her.\n\n\nLucia appears in the doorway, silhouetted by the light from their chambers.\n\n\nShe says nothing.

Some will want to follow, even if it means traveling alone. Others may...\" He trails off. \"Not every man who survives fever survives it whole.

The royal standard flies from her mainmast. She is not the largest ship ever built, but she is substantial—a vessel meant to carry a king across dangerous waters.\n\n\nCatalina stares.\n\n\n\"That one?

She grips the gunwale with white-knuckled intensity, staring at everything—the oarsmen, the seabirds, the approaching bulk of \"her\" ship.\n\n\n\"It's big,\" she whispers.\n\n\nThe Princesa Catalina looms above them as they approach. Up close, she is even more impressive—her hull freshly caulked and painted, the Castilian lions gleaming gold against crimson. The high sterncastle rises like a small fortress. Rigging stretches overhead in a complex web that speaks of journeys across vast waters.\n\n\nCaptain Sotomayor meets them at the rail as they climb aboard.\n\n\n\"Your Majesties. Welcome to the Princesa Catalina.\" He bows, then gestures broadly at the deck. \"She completed sea trials in December. Stable in heavy swells. Handles better than any carrack I've commanded in thirty years.\"\n\n\nThe deck is scrubbed clean, ropes coiled with precision, brass fittings polished bright. Sailors stand at attention along the rail.\n\n\n\"The queen's chambers, Your Majesty.\" Sotomayor leads them toward the sterncastle. \"Fitted exactly as specified.\"\n\n\nHe opens a heavy oak door.\n\n\nThe cabin beyond is surprisingly spacious—paneled in dark wood, with windows of thick glass looking out over the stern. A bed built into the bulkhead, wide enough for two. Cushioned benches along the walls. A writing desk secured to the deck. Tapestries hang to soften the wood and muffle the creak of timber.\n\n\nIt was designed for Isabel. She never saw it.\n\n\nLucia steps inside, her hand trailing along the polished wood. Her expression is unreadable.\n\n\nCatalina pushes past, exploring with the fearlessness of a child.\n\n\n\"This is mine?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"This is the queen's cabin, little one,\" Sotomayor explains gently. \"For your mama.\"\n\n\n\"Lucia-mama,\" Catalina corrects.

Storage areas\n9. The king's cabin (separate from queen's?)\n\nLet me make this immersive and historically appropriate.\n\n\nTHE TOUR OF THE PRINCESA CATALINA\n\n\nCaptain Sotomayor leads them from the queen's cabin with the pride of a man showing off his life's work.\n\n\n\nTHE KING'S CABIN\n\n\nAdjacent to the queen's chambers, connected by an internal door. Smaller, more functional—a soldier's space rather than a lady's retreat. A narrow bed, a desk with charts already spread across it, racks for weapons along one wall. A crucifix above the bed. Windows looking out over the wake.\n\n\n\"His Majesty can reach the deck in moments if needed,\" Sotomayor explains. \"And the queen's cabin without going outside.\"\n\n\n\nTHE GREAT CABIN\n\n\nBelow the royal chambers, spanning the width of the stern. This is where councils will be held, meals taken, decisions made. A long table dominates the space, bolted to the deck, with chairs that lock into place against the roll of the sea. Maps line the walls. Lanterns hang from brass hooks, designed to swing with the ship's motion without spilling flame.\n\n\n\"Room for twelve at table,\" Sotomayor notes. \"More if we squeeze.\"\n\n\nCatalina immediately climbs onto one of the chairs and declares herself \"Captain.\"\n\n\n\nTHE MAIN DECK\n\n\nThey emerge into salt air and winter sunlight. The deck stretches before them—longer than it seemed from the boat. Sailors work at tasks Juan cannot name, their movements efficient and purposeful.\n\n\nSotomayor points out the features:\n\n\n\"Three masts. Fore, main, and mizzen. Square sails on the fore and main for running before the wind, lateen on the mizzen for maneuvering.\" He gestures upward at the rigging. \"She can make eight knots in good wind. Five against it, tacking.\"\n\n\nCoils of rope thick as a man's arm. Barrels lashed along the rails. The great capstan for raising anchor, its bars worn smooth by generations of hands.\n\n\n\"Where are the cannons?\" Catalina asks loudly.\n\n\nSotomayor grins.\n\n\n\nTHE GUN DECK\n\n\nThey descend a ladder into the waist of the ship. Here the light dims, filtering through grated hatches. And here, crouching like iron beasts, are the guns.\n\n\n\"Twelve bombards,\" Sotomayor announces. \"Six to each side. Not the heaviest—we sacrificed weight for speed and stability—but enough to discourage pirates and punish any galley foolish enough to close with us.\"\n\n\nThe cannons are smaller than siege weapons, mounted on wheeled carriages that can be run out through ports in the hull. Powder kegs and shot are stored in locked compartments nearby.\n\n\n\"She's not a warship,\" Sotomayor clarifies. \"Not built to stand in a battle line. But she can fight if she must, and outrun what she cannot fight.\"\n\n\nCatalina reaches toward one of the bombards. Lucia catches her hand.\n\n\n\"Those are not for touching, cariño.\"\n\n\n\"But I want to see it boom.\"\n\n\n\"Perhaps when we are at sea,\" Juan's captain says diplomatically.\n\n\n\nTHE HOLD\n\n\nDeeper still, into the belly of the ship. Here the smell changes—bilge water, tar, the mustiness of stored provisions. Lanterns cast dancing shadows.\n\n\n\"Stores for three months if we must,\" Sotomayor explains. \"Water barrels here—\" he gestures at rows of casks, \"—salt meat, biscuit, dried fish. Wine. Oil. Everything a crew of eighty needs to cross any sea.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"And space for passengers. The knights will be distributed across the fleet, but we can carry fifty additional souls if needed. Not comfortable, but possible.\"\n\n\nThe hold is cramped, low-ceilinged. Catalina is the only one who can stand fully upright.\n\n\n\"It smells funny,\" she observes.\n\n\n\"All ships smell funny, little one,\" Sotomayor agrees. \"You get used to it.\"\n\n\n\nTHE FORECASTLE\n\n\nThey climb back to the deck and forward, past the mainmast, to the raised forecastle at the bow. This is the fighting platform—higher than the main deck, with wooden screens that can be raised to protect archers and crossbowmen.\n\n\n\"If we're boarded, this is where we make our stand,\" Sotomayor says. \"Thirty men can hold this against a hundred, with the right discipline.\"\n\n\nThe view from the bow is extraordinary. The harbor spreads before them, Barcelona's spires rising beyond. The sea stretches to the horizon, grey-green and endless.\n\n\nCatalina grips the rail, the wind whipping her dark hair.\n\n\n\"Where is Constanti-popple?\" she asks.\n\n\n\"Constantinople,\" Lucia corrects gently. \"Far away, cariño. Many days sailing. Past Rome, past Naples, past many islands.\"\n\n\nCatalina squints at the horizon, as if she might see it if she looks hard enough.\n\n\n\nTHE CREW\n\n\nSotomayor introduces his officers: the sailing master, a weathered Basque named Iñigo who has crossed to the Canaries and back; the boatswain, a barrel-chested man responsible for the rigging and deck; the ship's surgeon, a quiet Catalan who nods respectfully.\n\n\n\"Eighty souls, Your Majesty. Sailors, marines, gunners, officers. Every man knows his duty. Every man has sailed with me before.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"She is ready, Your Majesty. The Princesa Catalina will carry you wherever you need to go.\"\n\n\n\nLucia stands at the rail, looking back toward the city. Her hand rests on her belly—where the new child grows, still secret, still safe.\n\n\n\"It is a good ship,\" she says quietly.\n\n\nCatalina tugs at Juan's hand.\n\n\n\"Papa. Can we sail now?\""

Juan's meeting with Don Ramon de Perellós about protocol and the regency council\n3. The Consell de Cent meeting where Juan signed a letter establishing equal treatment for Aragonese merchants\n4. The Count of Pallars meeting (rolled 41 - grudging respect, no ground given; then rolled 9 - frustrated disappointment)\n5. Time with Catalina in the nursery\n6. The next day - Bishop's Mass at Cathedral of Santa Eulàlia where Juan asked for prayers for fallen sons of Naples (rolled 73 - resonates)\n7. Interaction with the grieving widow (rolled 4 - Catalina loses courage)\n8. Meeting with Don Guillem de Vic\n9. Days of exploring Barcelona - Festa de Sant Pau, Drassanes, La Llotja, Crossbow Guild, Falconry, Boqueria Market\n10. Letter arrives from Alfonso (February 4)\n11. The Regency Council meeting (February 6):\n    - Rocabertí's challenge and María's rebuke (rolled 98)\n    - Constantinople discussion (rolled 59 - mixed reception)\n    - Juan's offer regarding reciprocity on Constantinople commitments\n    - Naples letter vote (4-1 in favor, María abstains)\n    - Pallars' acknowledgment of Juan's honorable conduct\n12. Private conversation with María in the garden\n13. María's visit the next day with ensaïmadas, time with Catalina\n14. The remaining weeks - María joining the family regularly\n15. Catalina's survival and traits rolls:\n    - Survival: 73 (survives childhood)\n    - Intelligence: 87 (Brilliant)\n    - Temperament: 76 (Commanding)\n    - Special Talent: 34 → 5 (Voice - singing)\n    - Piety: 7 (Indifferent)\n    - Beauty: 70 (Beautiful)\n\nI notice Catalina's traits reveal a complex personality. The military and administrative aspects continue with Juan's leadership challenges. He inspects 700 knights with mixed results, delivering a speech that receives only grudging acknowledgment.

The Princesa Catalina rides at anchor behind them, waiting for March 5th.\n\n\nFour days remain.\n\n\nThe sick rest in hospital beds. The knights eat well and drink clean water. The commanders have found unity. The supplies are coming. María has found something she thought lost forever.\n\n\nAnd somewhere in the great cabin of the flagship, charts already show the route: Barcelona to Rome. Rome to Naples. Naples to Constantinople.\n\n\nThe edge of the world awaits.\n\n\n\nWhat an extraordinary chapter, Sicco.\n\n\nFrom the political triumph at the Consell de Cent to the painful meeting with Pallars, from María's tears in the garden to Catalina's fierce declaration that \"family gets hugs\"—this chapter wove together statecraft and family in ways that felt deeply human.\n\n\nAnd Catalina herself—brilliant, commanding, beautiful, with the voice of an angel and no faith to give those songs meaning. What a character to watch grow. What a tension to explore with Juan, who built everything on divine purpose.\n\n\nThe camp crisis was a perfect reminder that kings must solve problems, not just inspire. And the fleet inspection brought it full circle—the ship named for a princess, originally built for a queen who never lived to see it.\n\n\nReady for Rome when you are."
