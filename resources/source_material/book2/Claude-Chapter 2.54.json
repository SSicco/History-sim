They've asked me to use the chapter-start skill.\n\nLet me first read the chapter-start skill to understand what actions I need to perform at the start of a new chapter.\n\n\nView: Reading the chapter-start skill to understand required actions at the beginning of a new chapter\n\n\nThought process: Gathered narrative context from character database and previous chapter.\n\nNow I need to read the CHARACTER_DATABASE.md and the most recent chapter summary (Chapter 2.53). Let me do that.\n\n\nView: Reading the CHARACTER_DATABASE for current character information\n\n\nThought process: Accessed character database and retrieved prior chapter context.\n\nGood, I have the character database.

Let me summarize:\n\n**Current state at Chapter 2.53 end:**\n- **Date/Time:** Early July 1439, late afternoon\n- **Location:** Toledo, Alcázar, War Council Chamber\n- **Present:** Don Álvaro de Luna, Don Rodrigo Manrique, Don Fadrique, Masters of Military Orders, Sir Thomas Beaumont, Diego de Daza, various nobles\n- **Situation:** War council concluded; all questions addressed; Don Rodrigo has acknowledged orders\n- **Juan's Condition:** Healthy; satisfied with planning progress\n\nThe chapter ended with the war council concluded. The council had discussed the Tetouan campaign planning - timing (Spring 1440), command structure (Don Rodrigo Manrique), staging (from Portuguese Ceuta), and all the related logistics.\n\nUnresolved threads include:\n1. Portuguese Staging Rights - letter to King Duarte pending\n2. Coastal Survey - to be completed by winter 1439\n3. Rashid Coordination - Don Rodrigo to meet with them\n4. Artillery Drills\n\nAnd the diplomatic journey:\n5. Florence - Medici banking negotiations\n6. Hungary - Meeting with King Władysław III\n7. Poland - Diplomatic mission; crusade coalition building\n8. Queen Lucia as Regent during absence\n\nSo at the end of Chapter 2.53, the war council just concluded. The chapter introduction should pick up right there - Juan is still in the War Council Chamber with all the nobles, having just finished the council meeting.\n\nLet me write the chapter introduction now.\n\n\nChapter 2.54\n\n\nEarly July 1439, Late Afternoon\n\n\nThe last of the formal business has concluded. Don Rodrigo Manrique stands with the weight of his new command settling upon his shoulders—twelve thousand men, fifty siege guns, the first major African operation in living memory. The Masters of the Military Orders are already murmuring among themselves about galley deployments and supply arrangements. Sir Thomas Beaumont exchanges a few quiet words with Captain Rodrigo de Mendoza regarding which academy graduates might best serve on the Count of Paredes' staff.\n\n\nThe War Council Chamber still holds the tension of concentrated purpose. Maps of the Moroccan coast remain spread across the great table, marked with Don Fadrique's annotations regarding the cursed geography—rocky shores, silted river mouth, that exposed beach beneath the watchtower. The unfavorable landing roll has shaped the entire strategic approach: Ceuta, a Portuguese fortress, now becomes essential to the plan.\n\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna catches your eye from across the table, a slight raise of his eyebrows suggesting there are other matters awaiting attention—the letter to King Duarte regarding staging rights chief among them, but also the approaching diplomatic journey to Florence, Hungary, and Poland. The calendar presses forward; if you mean to depart for Italy before autumn, preparations must begin soon.\n\n\nThe nobles await either dismissal or further instruction. The afternoon light slants through the chamber's high windows, dust motes drifting in golden shafts."

      "say": "Thought process: Reconstructed family timeline and prepared emotional farewell scene.\n\nThe player wants Juan to leave the war council and go home to say goodbye to his family before departing for Florence tomorrow. This is a significant personal moment - Juan is leaving for an extended diplomatic journey (Florence, Hungary, Poland) that will take many months, leaving Queen Lucia as regent.\n\nLet me think about who would be at home:\n- Queen Lucia (pregnant, due September 1439 based on the timeline - wait, let me check. The character database says she's pregnant with child due September 1435, but that's outdated. The current date is July 1439. Let me think about this more carefully.)\n\nActually, looking at the chapter summary, we're in July 1439. The character database was last updated December 2025 covering up to February 1435. So I need to think about what's happened since then.\n\nFrom the chapter summary, it mentions \"Queen Lucia as Regent\" during Juan's absence. So she's alive and well. \n\nLet me think about the children:\n- Catalina - born January 28, 1432 - would be about 7 years old now\n- Fernando - born August 3, 1433 - would be almost 6 years old\n- Bianca - born September 14, 1434 - would be almost 5 years old\n- There was another pregnancy due September 1435 - so there's likely another child (Teresa? Juana? Nicolás? The memory mentions these names)\n\nThe userMemories mention: \"his children (Catalina, Fernando, Bianca, Teresa, Juana, and Nicolás)\" - so there are six children total by 1439.\n\nLet me think about the ages:\n- Catalina: 7 (born Jan 1432)\n- Fernando: 5-6 (born Aug 1433)\n- Bianca: 4-5 (born Sept 1434)\n- Teresa: ~3-4 (born Sept 1435 if that pregnancy)\n\n\n- Juana and Nicolás are the youngest children\n\nI want to craft a sensitive narrative about Juan's farewell, capturing the emotional weight of leaving his young family for a dangerous, months-long diplomatic mission. The scene will require careful attention to the children's ages and potential interactions, while exploring the complex feelings of separation and duty.\n\nI'll approach the family scene with nuance, avoiding assumptions about specific details like pregnancy or precise family dynamics. My focus will be on the emotional core of the moment - the tender, bittersweet goodbye between Juan and his loved ones.\n\nI'll be cautious about specifics, drawing only from confirmed information and allowing the emotional truth of the departure to guide the narrative's depth and sensitivity.\n\n\nThe nobles rise as you do, offering the customary courtesies as you take your leave. Don Álvaro falls into step beside you briefly in the corridor.\n\n\n\"The letter to Duarte will be ready for your seal by morning, Majesty. And the household has been preparing—the Queen has seen to everything.\" A pause, something almost gentle in his voice. \"Travel safely. Castile will be here when you return.\"\n\n\nYou clasp his arm once, and then you are walking through the familiar passages of the Alcázar, past guards who straighten at your approach, past servants who bow and murmur blessings for your journey. The late afternoon light pours through the windows, catching dust motes in the air, gilding the old stone walls.\n\n\n\nThe royal apartments are alive with the particular chaos of six children. You hear them before you see them—Fernando's voice raised in some argument with Catalina, the higher-pitched protests of the younger ones, the patient tones of nurses attempting to restore order before their father's arrival.\n\n\nQueen Lucia emerges from the inner chamber as you enter, her grey-green eyes finding yours immediately. At twenty-nine, she has grown into her role completely—the sharp-tongued Ferrarese bride has become a queen who commands respect throughout the realm. She wears a simple gown, her dark hair loosely bound; this is not an audience, but a farewell.\n\n\nThe children notice you almost simultaneously. Fernando, nearly six now and increasingly aware of his dignity as Prince of Asturias, attempts to compose himself. Catalina, at seven, has no such reservations—she breaks from the group and crosses to you with the particular confidence of a child who knows she is loved. The younger ones—Bianca, Teresa, Juana, little Nicolás toddling after—follow in a cascade of small bodies and reaching hands.\n\n\nLucia watches the children swarm you, a slight smile softening her expression. She waits until the initial greeting subsides before speaking.\n\n\n\"The little ones don't understand why Papá must go so far away,\" she says quietly. \"Fernando has been telling them you ride to fight dragons. Catalina corrected him—she said you ride to make friends with dragons, which is harder.\" Her eyes hold yours. \"How long, truly? The official dispatches say autumn. Your eyes say longer.\""

This is a personal, emotional scene - I should narrate it with care and attention to each child's personality as established in the character database.\n\nLet me check what I know about the children:\n- Fernando: Nearly 6, Prince of Asturias, heir to Castile. Has Juan's chin, Isabel's eyes. Growing awareness of his dignity.\n- Catalina: 7 years old, extraordinary singing voice, fearless, sunny disposition, calls Lucia \"Lucia-mama\"\n- Bianca: Born September 1434, so about 4-5 years old now (it's July 1439)\n- Teresa: Need to check - born after Bianca\n- Juana: Another younger child\n- Nicolás: The youngest, toddling\n\nWait, let me recalculate. The chapter summary says it's July 1439. Let me figure out the children's ages:\n- Fernando: Born August 3, 1433 - so he's almost 6 (will turn 6 in August 1439)\n- Catalina: Born January 28, 1432 - so she's 7 years old\n- Bianca: Born September 14, 1434 - so she's almost 5 (will turn 5 in September 1439)\n- Teresa, Juana, Nicolás: These are younger children born to Lucia after Bianca\n\nFrom Chapter 2.32, Lucia was pregnant again (due September 1435). So there have been more children since then. The database mentions the family has six children now.\n\nLet me think about the timeline:\n- September 1435: Fourth child born (Teresa?)\n- Then more children after that...\n\nActually, looking at the character database, it was last updated for February 1435, so it doesn't have the later children. But the summary mentions six children and names Fernando, Catalina, Bianca, Teresa, Juana, and Nicolás.\n \nI'll carefully map out the children's ages, noting their unique personalities and developmental stages. Each child represents a different moment in the family's journey, from the dignified heir to the toddling youngest. Their individual characteristics will shape how they interact during this poignant farewell scene.\n\nI'll craft a tender narrative that captures the family's intimate evening, highlighting each child's distinct temperament while maintaining an emotional depth that reflects the significance of this moment. The scene will unfold naturally, moving from shared family time to individual bedtime interactions, ultimately focusing on Juan and Lucia's quiet connection.\n\n\nLucia holds your gaze for a long moment, reading what lies beneath the words. Then she nods, once.\n\n\n\"Then we shall make tonight count.\"\n\n\n\nThe evening unfolds in the particular warmth of family gathered close. Supper is taken privately in the family's chambers rather than the great hall—a rare indulgence that delights the children. Cook has prepared Fernando's favorite almond pastries, and Catalina is permitted a small cup of watered wine like the adults, which she sips with exaggerated dignity. The conversation is loud, overlapping, punctuated by Nicolás banging his cup against the table and Teresa's attempts to feed bits of bread to an imaginary horse beneath her chair.\n\n\nYou watch them—truly watch them—committing each face to memory. Fernando, almost six, practicing his father's serious expressions but unable to maintain them when Bianca makes faces at him across the table. Catalina, seven and already so poised, quietly ensuring Juana has enough to eat before tending to her own plate. The fierce maternal instinct she inherited from somewhere—Isabel, perhaps, or learned from watching Lucia.\n\n\nWhen the meal ends and the nurses begin the gentle herding toward bed, you rise and announce that tonight, Papá will do the tucking in.\n\n\n\nNicolás goes first, being youngest. At not quite two, he has little understanding of what tomorrow means—only that father is here now, warm and solid, lifting him into the small bed. He clutches your finger with surprising strength and babbles something that might be \"horse\" or might be \"more\" or might be nothing at all. His eyes, heavy-lidded, fight sleep with the desperate determination of the very young. You stay until his grip loosens and his breathing deepens, his small chest rising and falling beneath the blanket.\n\n\n\nJuana, nearly three, is already half-asleep when you reach her, but she rouses enough to pat your beard with one hand.\n\n\n\"Scratchy,\" she announces—the same observation she has made every night for months. Then, with the devastating simplicity of small children: \"Come back.\"\n\n\nNot a question. A command. The imperative of a child who has never known a world where her commands might go unheeded.\n\n\n\nTeresa, four years old, has prepared. She sits upright in bed, a small carved horse clutched in her hands—one you gave her last year, you remember.\n\n\n\"Catalina says you're going to see the Pope,\" she says solemnly. \"Is he very old? Does he have a beard like yours? Catalina says he wears a special hat.\"\n\n\nShe has more questions—about Italy, about ships, about whether dragons are real—and you answer them all, or as many as you can before her eyelids grow heavy. When you kiss her forehead, she presses the carved horse into your hands.\n\n\n\"For the journey,\" she whispers. \"So you remember.\"\n\n\n\nBianca, nearly five, is the quiet one—always has been. She watches you enter with those grey-green eyes so like her mother's, and she does not ask questions or make demands. She simply extends her arms, waiting to be held.\n\n\nYou sit on the edge of her bed and she curls against you, her head beneath your chin. For a long while, neither of you speaks. Then, very softly:\n\n\n\"Will you miss us?\"\n\n\n\nFernando awaits you sitting up straight, attempting the dignity befitting a Prince of Asturias. He is almost six—old enough to understand that his father's journey is important, old enough to feel the weight of being the eldest son left behind.\n\n\n\"I will be good,\" he says, the words rehearsed. \"I will mind Mother and Don Álvaro and practice my letters and my riding.\" A pause. His composure wavers slightly. \"How many sleeps until you return?\"\n\n\nThe question hangs in the air. He is old enough now to count, old enough to understand that the answer matters.\n\n\n\nCatalina is last, and she has been waiting.\n\n\nAt seven, your firstborn daughter is old enough to understand too much—old enough to remember her birth mother's funeral, old enough to sense the currents beneath adult conversations. She sits cross-legged on her bed, her dark hair braided for sleep, watching you enter with an expression far too knowing for her years.\n\n\n\"I'm not going to cry,\" she announces, chin lifted. \"Teresa cried, and Bianca almost cried, but I'm not going to. You have important work.\"\n\n\nShe pats the bed beside her, and you sit.\n\n\n\"Lucia-mama explained about the councils and the kings you have to meet. She said you're building something—like a cathedral, but made of promises instead of stones.\" Catalina considers this. \"I think promises are harder than stones. Stones stay where you put them.\"\n\n\nShe is quiet for a moment, fidgeting with her braid. Then:\n\n\n\"Papá? When I sang for King Duarte, you looked at me like... like I'd done something important. Not just pretty—important.\" Her voice drops. \"Will you tell me, before you go, what you saw? What you're thinking about, when you look at me like that?\""

I should narrate the emotional impact of this moment and Catalina's response, then continue with the evening - likely leading to the final goodbye with Lucia. This is a tender family moment before Juan's long journey.\n\nLet me write Catalina's response authentically - she's seven, precocious, has experienced loss (her birth mother), and is trying to be brave. Juan's answer acknowledges her gift but also reassures her of her inherent worth.\n\n\nCatalina is quiet for a long moment, absorbing your words with that particular stillness she has—the one that reminds you, sometimes painfully, of Isabel in her most thoughtful moments.\n\n\n\"Lucia-mama says the same thing,\" she says finally. \"That we matter because we are, not because of what we do.\" She fidgets with her braid again, working through something. \"But then why does everyone care so much about what kings do? If Fernando matters because he is, why does everyone also talk about what kind of king he'll be?\"\n\n\nShe looks up at you, genuinely puzzled—not challenging, but trying to reconcile two truths that seem to contradict each other.\n\n\n\"I think maybe...\" she starts, then stops. Tries again. \"I think maybe you love us because we are. But other people will judge us by what we do.\" A small frown. \"That seems harder for Fernando than for me. I just have to sing and be pretty and marry someone important. He has to be good.\"\n\n\nThe observation is startlingly acute for a seven-year-old. She seems to recognize this herself, because she shakes her head and some of the solemnity breaks.\n\n\n\"I am going to miss you,\" she admits, the brave façade cracking just slightly. \"Even if I don't cry about it.\"\n\n\nShe leans against you, her head finding the hollow of your shoulder—still small enough to fit there, though not for many more years.\n\n\n\"Papá? Will you write to us? Real letters, not just the official ones that Don Álvaro reads to everyone. Letters just for us.\"\n\n\n\nWhen at last you leave Catalina's chamber—her eyes closed, her breathing even, one hand still loosely holding yours until sleep claimed her—you find Lucia waiting in the corridor. The torches have burned low. The Alcázar has grown quiet around you, the stones holding the particular stillness of a household settling into night.\n\n\nShe says nothing at first, simply studies your face in the flickering light. Then she steps closer and takes your hand—the same hand Catalina just released—and holds it against her chest, over her heart.\n\n\n\"Six children,\" she says softly. \"Six little pieces of you, staying here with me while the rest of you rides off to reshape the world.\" A pause. \"I used to think my uncle prepared me for anything. Ferrara was not a gentle education. But nothing prepared me for this—for loving someone so much that watching them leave feels like learning to breathe with half a lung.\"\n\n\nShe looks up at you, those grey-green eyes luminous in the torchlight.\n\n\n\"I will keep your kingdom safe. I will keep your children safe. I will write you letters full of their small victories and disasters, and I will not burden you with fears you cannot address from a thousand miles away.\" Her voice is steady, but her hand tightens on yours. \"And you will come back to me. Not to Castile, not to your throne, not to your grand alliance—to me. Say it.\""

Route: Toledo → Mediterranean coast (likely Valencia or Barcelona) → sea journey to Italian coast → overland to Florence\n2. Season: Early July 1439 - summer, good traveling weather\n3. Party: Royal guard escort - large armed party\n4. Duration: This is a significant journey - several weeks\n5. Political situation: Juan is traveling through friendly or neutral territory (Aragon, then Italian states)\n\nLet me think about the factors:\n\n**Risk-reducing factors:**\n- Large royal escort with guards\n- Summer season - good weather for travel\n- Experienced travelers (this isn't Juan's first time)\n- Well-established routes (major roads, known sea lanes)\n- Diplomatic preparations likely made in advance\n- Juan is a known and respected king - not a target for casual bandits\n- Traveling through allied/friendly territory (Aragon under Alfonso V is allied)\n\n**Risk-increasing factors:**\n- Long journey (several weeks)\n- Sea travel involved (Mediterranean crossing)\n- Italian political complexity (various factions, mercenary bands)\n- Distance from home if problems arise\n- Summer heat can cause illness\n- Multiple segments of travel (overland, sea, overland again)\n\n**Historical considerations:**\n- Royal parties were rarely attacked - bandits avoided well-armed groups\n- Mediterranean summer travel was relatively safe (outside storm season)\n- The main risks would be: illness, minor accidents, delays from administrative issues\n- Italian roads had some bandit activity but major routes were patrolled\n- Papal States and Florence were generally stable\n\nLet me construct a realistic table.

Serious problems should be rare.\n\nI should probably do one comprehensive roll for the entire journey, or break it into segments. Given the skill guidance, a single roll for the journey seems appropriate unless complications arise that require further rolls.\n\n\nLucia holds your gaze in the torchlight, searching for certainty in words that can never fully carry it. Whatever she finds there seems to satisfy her. She rises on her toes and kisses you—not the formal kiss of queen to king, but something fiercer, something that speaks of seven years of partnership and the fear that lives beneath composure.\n\n\n\"Then go,\" she whispers against your lips. \"Build your cathedral of promises. I will hold Castile until you return.\"\n\n\n\nThe morning comes too soon. Dawn breaks over Toledo, painting the Tagus gold and rose, and the royal household stirs to the particular bustle of departure. Your guard is assembled in the courtyard—fifty mounted men in the royal colors, seasoned riders all, plus packhorses bearing supplies, gifts for the Medici, and the documentation required for a king traveling abroad.\n\n\nThe children are not brought out for the formal departure; you said your goodbyes last night, and Lucia has wisely spared them the spectacle of watching you ride away. She stands at the top of the steps in the morning light, one hand raised in farewell, the other pressed to her belly where your seventh child grows.\n\n\nYou mount. The gates open. Toledo falls behind.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll: Journey from Toledo to Florence\n\n\nRoute: Toledo → Valencia → sea passage to Genoa → overland to Florence\nDuration: Approximately 3-4 weeks\nSeason: Early July (summer—favorable for travel)\n\n\nRisk-reducing factors:\n\n\nLarge armed royal escort (50 men)\n\nSummer season with predictable weather\n\nEstablished diplomatic routes through allied/neutral territory\n\nJuan's status as recognized king—not a target for opportunistic bandits\n\nAragonese territory (Valencia) under allied King Alfonso V\n\nPrior diplomatic preparations with Florence and Genoa\n\nExperienced travelers; not Juan's first Italian journey\n\n\nRisk-increasing factors:\n\n\nLong journey with multiple segments (overland, sea, overland)\n\nMediterranean sea passage required\n\nItalian political complexity (various factions, mercenary companies)\n\nSummer heat may cause minor illness\n\nDistance from Castile if serious problems arise\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-3\nSerious illness — Juan or significant portion of guard falls ill; journey halted for treatment\n4-8\nSea trouble — Storm, contrary winds, or ship problems cause significant delay and potential danger\n9-15\nPolitical complication — Unexpected diplomatic incident, local unrest, or territorial dispute affects passage\n16-25\nMinor delays — Weather, road conditions, administrative issues, or minor illness add 5-7 days to journey\n26-40\nUneventful but slow — No problems, but travel takes full expected duration with minor inconveniences\n41-70\nSmooth journey — Travel proceeds without notable incident; arrive on schedule\n71-85\nSwift passage — Favorable winds, good roads, efficient arrangements; arrive several days early\n86-95\nFortunate encounters — Meet useful travelers, receive valuable news, or encounter unexpected opportunity en route\n96-100\nExceptional fortune — Remarkably smooth journey with significant beneficial encounter or news\n\nPlease roll d100."

This is a significant difference that would substantially reduce risks. A 500-man royal escort is essentially a small army - no bandits or mercenary companies would dare attack such a force. This also changes the logistics somewhat (larger party moves slower, needs more supplies) but the security is vastly improved.\n\nLet me redraft the table with this in mind.\n\nKey changes:\n- Virtually eliminate bandit/attack risks - no one attacks a 500-man royal army\n- Political complications become even less likely - this is clearly a major diplomatic mission\n- Logistics become slightly more complex (feeding/housing 500 men)\n- The sea passage becomes the main variable - need multiple ships for 500 men\n- Minor illness in a party this size is almost guaranteed to affect someone, but unlikely to affect Juan specifically\n- Overall, this should shift the table significantly toward uneventful/positive outcomes\n\nThe journey is:\n- Toledo to Valencia (overland, through Castilian then Aragonese territory - completely safe)\n- Valencia to Genoa (sea passage - this is the main risk point, need a small fleet for 500 men)\n- Genoa to Florence (short overland journey through Italian territory)\n\nThen eventually onward to Hungary and Poland, but that's future travel.\n\nWith 500 men:\n- No meaningful bandit risk\n- Political complications very unlikely (this is clearly a major state visit)\n- Sea passage is the main variable - storms, contrary winds\n- Logistics of moving 500 men\n- Summer heat illness possible but unlikely to seriously affect Juan given his status and care\n\nLet me recalibrate:\n- 1-2: Serious illness affecting Juan personally (rare even with 500 men - he has best care)\n- 3-6: Sea trouble (storms, contrary winds for a fleet carrying 500 men)\n- 7-10: Minor political friction (not a complication, just friction - someone insulted, need to smooth things)\n\n\n- 11-20: Minor delays emerge from coordinating such a large traveling party\n- 21-40: Journey proceeds without significant interruption\n- 41-75: Passage remains consistently smooth\n- 76-90: Expedition moves with remarkable efficiency\n- 91-97: Unexpected positive interactions or opportunities arise\n- 98-100: Extraordinary favorable conditions prevail\n\nI'm contemplating the probability across 100 hypothetical journeys. Serious personal illness for Juan seems increasingly improbable given the extensive preparations and medical support available to a royal traveler.\n\nPotential journey disruptions appear minimal: sea challenges might materialize 3-5 times, political complications rarely emerging at 1-2 instances. Minor logistical setbacks would likely occur in roughly 15-20% of expeditions. Most voyages would transpire without notable incident, maintaining a predictable and controlled progression.\n\n\nA 500-man escort changes the calculation significantly. This is not a traveling party—this is a small army on the move. No bandit would dream of approaching such a force, and even mercenary companies would think twice. The main variables become logistics, weather, and the sea passage.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll: Journey from Toledo to Florence\n\n\nRoute: Toledo → Valencia → sea passage to Genoa → overland to Florence\nDuration: Approximately 3-4 weeks\nSeason: Early July (summer—favorable for travel)\n\n\nRisk-reducing factors:\n\n\nMassive armed escort (500 men)—effectively a small army; no opportunistic attacks possible\n\nSummer season with predictable weather\n\nEstablished diplomatic routes through allied/neutral territory\n\nJuan's status as recognized king on major diplomatic mission\n\nAragonese territory under allied King Alfonso V\n\nPrior diplomatic preparations with Florence and Genoa\n\nExperienced command structure for managing large force movement\n\nMultiple ships required for sea passage reduces single-point-of-failure risk\n\n\nRisk-increasing factors:\n\n\nLogistics of moving 500 men (food, lodging, coordination)\n\nFleet required for sea passage—more ships means more coordination\n\nSummer heat affecting large body of men on the march\n\nItalian political complexity (though 500 men discourages interference)\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-2\nSerious illness — Juan personally falls ill; journey halted for recovery\n3-6\nSea trouble — Storm or contrary winds scatter fleet or cause significant delay\n7-12\nLogistical problems — Supply issues, coordination failures, or local friction housing 500 men causes delays and expense\n13-22\nMinor delays — Weather, road conditions, or administrative issues add several days\n23-40\nStandard journey — No significant problems; arrive on expected schedule\n41-75\nSmooth journey — Well-coordinated travel; minor inconveniences only\n76-88\nSwift passage — Favorable winds, efficient arrangements; arrive ahead of schedule\n89-96\nFortunate encounters — Valuable news, useful contacts, or diplomatic opportunities en route\n97-100\nExceptional fortune — Remarkably smooth journey with significant beneficial development\n\nPlease roll d100."

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated uneventful journey narrative toward Florence arrival.\n\nThe player rolled 30, which falls in the range 21-40: \"Standard journey — No significant problems; arrive on expected schedule with minor inconveniences.\"\n\nThis means the journey proceeds without significant issues. I should narrate the uneventful but realistic journey from Toledo to Florence, touching on the key segments (overland to Valencia, sea passage to Genoa, overland to Florence) without inventing drama. Since this is a standard journey, I can move through it relatively quickly and bring Juan to Florence ready for his meeting with the Medici.\n\nI'll narrate the journey and then set the scene for arrival in Florence, stopping at an appropriate point for Juan to act.\n\n\nRoll: 30 — Standard Journey\n\n\n\nThe road from Toledo to Valencia is long, hot, and thoroughly uneventful.\n\n\nFive hundred men move slowly across the Castilian meseta, raising a plume of dust that announces your passage to every village for leagues around. The July sun beats down relentlessly, and your physicians recommend breaking travel during the hottest hours of the afternoon—a sensible precaution that adds two days to the overland portion but prevents heat sickness among men and horses alike.\n\n\nThe baggage train proves the greatest challenge. One hundred mules and their drivers, loaded with everything from diplomatic gifts to cooking pots, stretch the column to nearly a league in length. Villages that might comfortably host fifty men struggle to accommodate five hundred; your quartermasters earn their wages finding sufficient fodder, water, and sleeping space each night. The costs mount—innkeepers and farmers along the route charge premium prices for a royal embassy, knowing you cannot simply ride on and leave men hungry.\n\n\nValencia provides welcome relief. King Alfonso's officials have prepared for your arrival, and the fleet awaits in the harbor: six carracks and four galleys, enough to transport your entire party in reasonable comfort. You spend three days in the city while the household is loaded aboard—an exercise in organized chaos that your stewards manage with only moderate cursing and no serious injuries.\n\n\nThe sea passage to Genoa takes nine days. The winds are adequate but not exceptional, requiring the galleys to row for two full days when the sails hang limp. The Mediterranean in July is calm enough, though several of your servants spend the voyage green-faced and miserable. You fare better, having made this crossing before.\n\n\nGenoa receives you with appropriate ceremony—the Doge sends representatives to escort you through the city, and you spend a night in quarters prepared by the Republic before continuing overland. The Genoese are coolly correct; they have not forgotten that Castile's growing naval power competes with their own in certain waters. But they offer no obstruction to a king passing through on diplomatic business.\n\n\nThe final leg, from Genoa to Florence through the Apennine passes and down into Tuscany, takes another week. The roads are good—Florence invests heavily in the routes that carry their trade—and by late July, you see the red dome of Brunelleschi's cathedral rising above the Tuscan hills.\n\n\n\nLate July 1439, Afternoon\n\n\nFlorence spreads before you in the summer haze, the Arno glittering like hammered bronze beneath the afternoon sun. Your heralds have ridden ahead; the Signoria knows you are coming, and more importantly, so do the Medici.\n\n\nCosimo de' Medici is not a duke or a prince—officially, he is merely a banker, a private citizen of the Republic. In practice, he is the most powerful man in Florence, his wealth and influence shaping the politics of half of Italy. His bank handles papal finances, Venetian trade, and the accounts of half the crowned heads of Europe. If you are to fund a crusade, you will need his cooperation.\n\n\nYour majordomo rides up alongside you as the column begins its descent toward the city gates.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, the Florentine delegation awaits at the Porta San Gallo. The Signoria has arranged lodgings at the Palazzo della Parte Guelfa—comfortable, central, and appropriately dignified for a visiting sovereign.\" He hesitates. \"I am told Cosimo de' Medici has sent word that he would be honored to receive Your Majesty at his convenience. No specific time proposed—he leaves the initiative to you.\"\n\n\nThe city gates are opening. Florentine banners flutter in the hot breeze. Somewhere in the maze of streets and palazzos ahead, the man who might finance your war against the Ottomans waits to take your measure."

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated unannounced royal visit to Florence's most powerful banker.\n\nThe player wants to visit Cosimo de' Medici immediately upon arrival in Florence, rather than waiting until tomorrow. This is a bold, somewhat unconventional move - arriving unannounced (or with very short notice) at the home of the most powerful banker in Europe.\n\nLet me think about what this scene should look like:\n\n1. The walk through Florence - Juan with his guard, through the streets of the city\n2. Arrival at the Palazzo Medici\n3. The reception - how does Cosimo respond to an unannounced royal visit?\n\nCosimo de' Medici in 1439:\n- He's about 50 years old (born 1389)\n- He returned from exile in 1434 and has been consolidating power\n- He's the de facto ruler of Florence but maintains the fiction of being a private citizen\n- He's enormously wealthy - the Medici bank is the most powerful in Europe\n- He handles papal finances\n- He's known for his political cunning, his patronage of the arts, and his careful management of appearances\n\nThe Palazzo Medici in 1439 - actually, I need to be careful here. The famous Palazzo Medici-Riccardi wasn't built until 1444-1484. In 1439, Cosimo would still be living in the older Medici family home. Let me not specify too much architectural detail that might be anachronistic.\n\nHow would Cosimo react to Juan showing up immediately? This is unconventional - kings usually send word ahead and arrange formal audiences. But Juan arriving immediately, in person, with his guard, shows:\n1. Confidence - he's not playing games\n2. Urgency - he has business to discuss\n3. Respect in a way - he's coming to Cosimo rather than summoning Cosimo to him\n\nCosimo is a master of reading people. He would likely appreciate the directness and be intrigued. He would also be prepared - a man like Cosimo always has his household ready for important visitors.\n \nI'll craft a narrative sequence that captures the dramatic arrival and initial interaction. The scene will unfold through Juan's journey across Florence, highlighting the city's bustling streets and the anticipation building as he approaches Cosimo's residence. I'll carefully choreograph the initial greeting, showing Cosimo's measured response to this unexpected royal visitor.\n\n\nYour secretary's eyebrows rise a fraction—the only sign of surprise he permits himself. \"Now, Your Majesty? Without sending word ahead?\"\n\n\n\"Now.\"\n\n\n\nThe streets of Florence in the golden hour of late afternoon are alive with commerce and conversation. Your guard forms around you—not the full hundred, but twenty men in Castilian colors, enough to demonstrate royal dignity without appearing to invade the city. Citizens pause in doorways and market stalls to watch the foreign king pass. Some bow; most simply stare with the frank curiosity of Florentines, who have seen popes and emperors come to bargain with their bankers.\n\n\nThe Palazzo Medici lies in the heart of the city, near the church of San Lorenzo. It is not the grandest house in Florence—Cosimo is too clever for ostentation—but it is substantial, well-appointed, the home of a family that has been accumulating wealth and influence for generations. The facade is modest stone, the windows shuttered against the summer heat.\n\n\nYour arrival causes a brief flurry at the entrance. A steward appears, his expression betraying only a moment's uncertainty before professional composure reasserts itself.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty of Castile.\" A deep bow. \"We... the household was not informed...\"\n\n\n\"I received Signor Cosimo's invitation,\" you say. \"I am here at my convenience.\"\n\n\nThe steward recovers admirably. \"Of course, Your Majesty. Please—if you will follow me. I will inform the padrone immediately.\"\n\n\n\nThe interior of the house is cool, elegant without excess. You are shown to a receiving room decorated with tasteful frescoes—classical scenes, nothing overtly religious or political. Wine and small dishes appear within moments, offered by servants who move with the quiet efficiency of a household accustomed to important guests arriving without warning.\n\n\nYou do not wait long.\n\n\nCosimo de' Medici enters the room alone, without attendants or ceremony. He is perhaps fifty years old, his dark hair silvered at the temples, his face lined but alert. He wears the simple dark robes of a Florentine merchant—no silk, no jewels, nothing to distinguish him from a prosperous cloth trader. Only his eyes mark him as something more: watchful, intelligent, measuring you even as he offers a warm smile and a bow that is respectful without being servile.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His voice is pleasant, unhurried. \"You honor my house. I confess I did not expect the King of five crowns to walk through my door before the dust of the road had settled from his boots.\" A slight smile. \"Most kings prefer to let bankers come to them.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to a chair, taking one himself—not across from you like an audience, but at an angle, as if settling in for conversation between equals.\n\n\n\"But then, I am told Your Majesty is not most kings.\" His eyes rest on yours with frank interest. \"You conquered Granada before you were thirty. You sailed to Constantinople when wiser men counseled caution. You sit on thrones that your grandfather could not have dreamed of.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands slightly—an invitation.\n\n\n\"So. What brings the Defensor Romaniae to the house of a Florentine banker, with such urgency that it could not wait until morning?\""

This is a critical NPC interaction.\n\n**What does Cosimo want?**\n- Profit, obviously - that's his business\n- Stability for his bank - he's seen banks fail\n- Political protection - the Medici were exiled once already (1433, though they returned in 1434)\n- Expansion of influence - access to Iberian markets, African gold, etc.\n- Independence from any single patron - he wouldn't want to become a tool of any one crown\n- Information - bankers thrive on knowing things before others\n\n**What won't he say?**\n- The exact extent of the bank's exposure/vulnerabilities\n- His concerns about becoming too dependent on any one patron\n- His calculations about whether Juan's empire will last\n- The interest rates he's charging Juan compared to others\n- What he knows about Juan from his network of informants\n\n**What has he seen?**\n- Juan's meteoric rise - Granada, Constantinople, now five crowns\n- The unprecedented wealth flowing from Granada's silver (he would know about the Roll: 100 silver discovery)\n- Juan's reputation for generosity (which makes bankers nervous - generous kings spend money)\n- Juan's bold/risky decisions that have mostly paid off\n- The papal alliance, the Ottoman truce, the African ventures\n- Alfonso V's death and Juan's inheritance - that's a lot of power concentrated in one man\n- The Iota coins Juan just showed him - that's interesting, a new currency\n \nI see the potential risks and rewards of this partnership. Juan's precious metal reserves offer extraordinary security, but also create deep vulnerability. Cosimo understands that aligning with such a powerful yet unpredictable monarch requires meticulous calculation. He'll weigh the potential for massive profit against the danger of being caught in a potential imperial collapse.\n\nThe Iota coin system intrigues him - a new currency backed by substantial resources could revolutionize banking. But Cosimo's mind is already mapping potential pitfalls: succession uncertainty, mining volatility, royal spending patterns, geopolitical tensions, and the risk of becoming a political instrument.\n\nHis approach will be strategic. He'll listen carefully, ask probing questions, and reveal nothing until he fully comprehends Juan's true intentions and the comprehensive landscape of this potential alliance.\n\n\nCosimo listens without interruption, his expression giving nothing away. His eyes drop to the Iota coins as you place them on the table—the distinctive symbol catching the lamplight—and he picks one up with the practiced ease of a man who has handled more coins than most kings have minted. He turns it over, tests its weight, examines the stamp.\n\n\n\"Iota,\" he murmurs. \"The Greek letter. Ioannes.\" He sets the coin down and looks at you with something that might be the first flicker of genuine respect. \"You think in symbols as well as steel. That is... not common among kings.\"\n\n\nHe leans back in his chair, steepling his fingers.\n\n\n\"You have described the relationship between bank and crown with more precision than most of my own partners manage. Yes, we hold Castilian assets. Yes, my representative in Toledo would have... concerns... about immediate full withdrawal.\" A slight, dry smile. \"As would I. That is the nature of banking—we hold many men's gold, and we put it to work. If every depositor demanded his coins on the same day, every bank in Christendom would fail. This is not weakness; it is the mechanism by which wealth multiplies rather than sitting idle in vaults.\"\n\n\nHe picks up the Iota coin again, turning it between his fingers.\n\n\n\"What you propose is... substantial. You speak of silver from your own lands—the Sierra Nevada, I presume. Word travels.\" His eyes meet yours. \"Word of a discovery that has made your treasury the envy of Christendom. And gold from Africa—the Portuguese ventures, yes? Or have you found your own route to the sources?\"\n\n\nHe sets the coin down with a soft click.\n\n\n\"A bank backed by a guaranteed flow of precious metals would indeed be more stable. Extraordinarily so. But stability is not the only consideration.\" He pauses, choosing his words with care. \"The Medici bank serves many crowns, Your Majesty. France, England, the Papacy, the Italian states, the German princes. Our independence—our ability to serve all without being captured by any—is the foundation of our reputation. If we become your bank, backed by your metals, dependent on your empire...\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"Then we are no longer the Medici bank. We are the treasury of Castile with a Florentine address. Every prince who fears your growing power—and there are many, Your Majesty, as you surely know—would take their business elsewhere. They would have to. A man does not deposit his gold with his rival's banker.\"\n\n\nCosimo rises and moves to a side table, pouring wine for both of you without waiting for servants. It is a curiously intimate gesture—the richest man in Florence serving a king with his own hands.\n\n\n\"I am not refusing,\" he says, handing you a cup. \"I am thinking aloud. You have come to me with an extraordinary proposition. You deserve an honest response, not flattery.\"\n\n\nHe sits again, swirling the wine in his cup.\n\n\n\"So let me ask you plainly, Your Majesty: what do you actually want from the Medici bank? Not philosophy—specifics. What services? What volume? What arrangements?\" His eyes sharpen. \"And what happens to this partnership if you sail to Constantinople and do not return? Your heir is—what, six years old? Regencies are unstable things. Empires built by one man often do not survive him.\"\n\n\nHe drinks, watching you over the rim of his cup.\n\n\n\"Convince me that I am investing in an institution, not merely in Juan of Castile. Then we can discuss terms.\""

And if tying the bank to Castile would compromise Medici independence, Juan is prepared to start his own bank.\n\nThis is a pivotal moment. Cosimo is a brilliant businessman and politician. He needs to think about:\n\n1. What he wants: To keep the Castilian deposits (which are substantial), to maintain relationships with the most powerful rising king in Europe, but also to maintain his bank's independence and neutrality which is the source of its power.\n\n2. What he won't say directly: How much he actually needs Castilian business, how worried he is about Juan starting a rival institution, his assessment of Juan's long-term survival prospects.\n\n3. What he's seen: A king who walks into his house unannounced (confidence, unconventional), who speaks of banks and crowns as separate institutions (sophistication), who has Iota coins already minted (planning ahead), who conquered Granada and now holds five crowns (competence and ambition), who is clearly thinking about institutional permanence.\n\nCosimo's calculation:\n- If Juan withdraws all his deposits, it would hurt but probably not collapse the bank\n- But if Juan starts his own bank backed by Sierra Nevada silver and African gold, that's a genuine competitive threat\n- A Castilian royal bank could potentially draw business away from Medici in certain markets\n- Better to find an arrangement that keeps Juan as a client while maintaining independence\n\nCosimo is too smart to let pride get in the way of business. He'll be honest about what he can and can't do. He won't bluff about the bank collapsing - Juan has already called that bluff by noting the representative turned green.\n\nLet me write Cosimo's response - he should be direct, practical, and propose something that works for both parties.\n\n\nCosimo's expression shifts—a subtle thing, but you catch it. The mask of the gracious host gives way, just for a moment, to the calculating mind beneath. He sets down his wine cup with deliberate care.\n\n\n\"Ah.\" A single syllable, weighted with reassessment. \"You are not here to propose a partnership. You are here to ask if you need one.\"\n\n\nHe is quiet for a long moment, studying you with eyes that have measured princes and popes.\n\n\n\"Let me be direct, Your Majesty, since you have done me the courtesy of directness. If you withdrew your deposits tomorrow—all of them, in coin—it would not collapse my bank. It would hurt. We would need to call in loans, liquidate certain positions, disappoint some clients who expected capital that would no longer be available. There would be... disruption. But the Medici bank has survived worse. We survived exile. We survived the Albizzi. We will survive the King of Castile deciding he prefers his gold in his own vaults.\"\n\n\nHe picks up the Iota coin again, holding it to the light.\n\n\n\"But you are not asking about tomorrow. You are asking about the future—about an empire that spans five crowns and may soon span more. About volumes of trade and military expenditure that will only grow. About whether the Medici bank can serve as the financial architecture of...\" he gestures vaguely, encompassing everything you represent, \"...whatever it is you are building.\"\n\n\nHe sets the coin down between you.\n\n\n\"The honest answer is: perhaps not. Not as we are currently structured. The sums you will require, the speed of transfer across multiple kingdoms, the guarantees you would need...\" He shakes his head slowly. \"You are thinking like an emperor, Your Majesty. The Medici bank was built to serve merchants and princes, not empires.\"\n\n\nCosimo rises and moves to the window, looking out at the darkening Florentine street.\n\n\n\"If you start your own bank—a royal bank, backed by Castilian silver and African gold—you will have something we cannot offer: the guarantee of a sovereign. Your bank cannot fail because you cannot permit it to fail. Every coin becomes, in essence, a promise from the Crown of Castile.\" He turns back to face you. \"That is a powerful thing. Dangerous, if mismanaged. But powerful.\"\n\n\nHe returns to his seat, and when he speaks again, his tone has changed—less the philosopher, more the merchant.\n\n\n\"So. You have two paths before you, and I will not pretend to choose for you. You may withdraw your deposits—not tomorrow, but over six months, let us say, to avoid unnecessary disruption—and build your own institution. I will not stand in your way. We can part as friends, and the Medici bank will continue to serve those who prefer our... neutrality.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"Or.\"\n\n\nThe word hangs in the air.\n\n\n\"Or we discuss something else entirely. Not the Medici bank becoming your bank—that I cannot offer. But perhaps... a Medici bank that works alongside your bank. Correspondent arrangements. We handle your business in territories where a Castilian royal bank would be unwelcome—France, England, the German states, the Italian republics. Your bank handles the empire. When funds must move between your sphere and ours, we facilitate the exchange.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"Two banks. Two spheres. Connected but independent. You keep your sovereignty; I keep my neutrality. Neither of us depends entirely on the other.\"\n\n\nHis eyes meet yours, sharp and probing.\n\n\n\"That is what I can offer.

Let me think about what Juan's territories are at this point in time (1439):\n\n1. Castile and León - core kingdom\n2. Granada - conquered 1432\n3. Aragon - inherited from Alfonso V in 1437\n4. Naples - inherited from Alfonso V in 1437\n5. Sicily - inherited from Alfonso V in 1437\n6. Constantinople - not exactly a territory but Juan has significant influence as \"Defensor Romaniae\"\n\nNow, historically, the Medici bank had branches in various locations. Let me think about what would be realistic:\n\nThe Medici bank historically had branches in:\n- Florence (headquarters)\n- Rome (handling papal finances)\n- Venice\n- Milan\n- Naples\n- Bruges\n- London\n- Avignon\n- Geneva\n\nSo in Juan's territories, the Medici would likely have:\n- Naples (definitely - major Italian commercial center)\n- Possibly Barcelona or Valencia for Aragonese trade\n- Maybe not directly in Castile - Castile was less commercially developed\n\nCosimo should answer honestly about this. He's being direct with Juan, and this is a factual question about where his bank operates.\n\nI should have Cosimo answer this question directly, listing where the Medici have branches in Juan's territories. This is information Juan would want to know for practical purposes.\n\n\nCosimo nods—the question of a practical man getting down to specifics.\n\n\n\"In your territories directly?\" He ticks them off on his fingers. \"Naples, certainly. We have maintained a branch there for decades—it is one of our larger operations outside Florence. The papal trade flows through Naples, the grain trade, the silk. When Alfonso wore that crown, we served him. Now that you wear it, we serve you.\"\n\n\nA second finger.\n\n\n\"Barcelona. A smaller office, but active. The Aragonese wool trade, the Mediterranean shipping, correspondence with our branches in Bruges and London. Your sister—forgive me, your late cousin's widow—dealt with us during her regency. We have... relationships there.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, considering.\n\n\n\"Valencia, we work through correspondents rather than our own house. Adequate for current volumes, but not a full branch.\"\n\n\nA third finger does not rise.\n\n\n\"Castile proper? No. Toledo, Seville, Burgos—we have no permanent presence. Castilian merchants have historically preferred to work through Genoese bankers, or through their own networks. The converso financiers handle much of the internal trade. We receive Castilian business through Naples or Barcelona, but...\" He shrugs. \"Your kingdom was not, until recently, of sufficient commercial interest to justify the expense of a full branch.\"\n\n\nHe allows a dry smile.\n\n\n\"That calculation, I suspect, is now obsolete. A king who holds Castile, Granada, Aragon, Naples, and Sicily—who receives African gold and Sierra Nevada silver—is of considerable commercial interest. If we were to continue our relationship, a Medici presence in Seville or Toledo would become... advisable.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward slightly.\n\n\n\"But you see the shape of things, yes? I am strong where you were weak—in Naples, in Barcelona, in the Italian trade. I am absent where you are building something new—in Castile, in Granada, in your Atlantic ventures. If you create your own bank, you will duplicate what I already offer in some places, while building from nothing in others.\"\n\n\nHe gestures between you.\n\n\n\"The question is whether that duplication serves your interests, or whether division of labor serves them better. I cannot answer that for you. Only you know the shape of the empire you intend to build.\""

This is a very practical, operational question that gets at how medieval banking actually worked.\n\nLet me think about how Cosimo would answer this - he's a banker explaining his business model to a king who is clearly evaluating whether to continue using his services or start his own bank. He would want to be clear and demonstrate competence, but also perhaps not reveal everything that might make the king realize he doesn't need the Medici.\n\nWhat Cosimo wants: To maintain the relationship with Castile, which is now a massive account. He doesn't want Juan to start his own bank and cut him out entirely.\n\nWhat Cosimo won't say directly: How much profit he makes on the float, on the exchange rates, on the delays in transfer. He'll describe the mechanics but perhaps gloss over exactly how lucrative this is for him.\n\nWhat Cosimo has seen: A king who thinks strategically, who understands banking at a conceptual level, and who is clearly evaluating his options. This is not a man to be fooled with vague answers.\n\nThe mechanics of medieval banking for tax collection would involve:\n1. A noble or merchant deposits coins or goods at a local Medici branch\n2. The Medici issues a letter of credit or bill of exchange\n3. The noble gets a receipt showing payment to the Crown\n4. The Crown can draw on this credit at another Medici branch, or the Medici transfers funds (eventually) to the Crown's account\n5. The bank profits from: the float (time between deposit and withdrawal), exchange fees, and the ability to lend out deposited money in the meantime\n\nCosimo should explain this clearly but the king should be able to read between the lines about the profit margins involved.\n\n\nCosimo's eyes narrow slightly—not with suspicion, but with the recognition that you are asking the right questions. The questions of a man who wants to understand the mechanism, not merely the outcome.\n\n\n\"Very well. Let us walk through it.\"\n\n\nHe moves to a writing desk and retrieves a sheet of paper, sketching as he speaks—a map of sorts, with lines connecting points.\n\n\n\"Say a wool merchant in Barcelona owes the Crown one thousand florins in duties. He comes to our branch there. He does not wish to transport a chest of gold across your kingdoms—the risk of robbery, the cost of guards, the time.\" Cosimo draws a small circle. \"So instead, he deposits his coin with us. We give him a letter—a lettera di cambio—confirming that one thousand florins have been paid to the account of the Crown of Aragon.\"\n\n\nA line drawn to another circle.\n\n\n\"Now. That money sits in our Barcelona vault. But you, the King, are in Toledo. Or Naples. Or Constantinople, for all it matters. You wish to pay soldiers in Sicily, or purchase grain in Valencia, or settle a debt with a Florentine supplier.\" He taps the paper. \"You do not need to wait for a mule train to carry the merchant's gold across the mountains. You simply draw on your account. You send word—or your treasurer does—that you require ten thousand florins disbursed in Naples. Our branch there pays it out from their vault.\"\n\n\nHe draws another line.\n\n\n\"The gold in Barcelona never moves. The gold in Naples never moves. What moves is... information. Obligations. Trust.\" He sets down the quill. \"At the end of each quarter, our branches reconcile. Barcelona owes Naples for what was drawn. Naples owes Florence for what they advanced. Florence owes Barcelona for... and so on. The physical metal moves rarely, and in bulk, under heavy guard, when the imbalances grow too large to sustain.\"\n\n\nCosimo returns to his seat.\n\n\n\"For this service, we charge a cambium—a fee for the exchange. Typically two to three percent, depending on the distance and the risk. We also profit from the time between when the merchant deposits and when you withdraw. That money does not sit idle in our vault, Your Majesty. We lend it—carefully, to reliable borrowers, at interest. When you eventually draw on it, we have already earned from its use.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands, unapologetic.\n\n\n\"This is how banking works. We provide convenience, speed, and safety. We assume risk—the risk that our borrowers default, that our branches are robbed, that a king decides not to honor a debt. In exchange, we profit from the mechanism.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes steadily.\n\n\n\"In your case, the volumes are... significant. Hundreds of thousands of florins flow through our Naples branch alone in your name. We profit handsomely from serving the Crown. I will not pretend otherwise.\" A slight pause. \"But you also benefit. Your taxes arrive faster. Your payments reach distant corners of your empire without the expense and danger of physical transport. Your treasury functions as a single entity, not five separate hoards in five separate vaults.\"\n\n\nHe gestures at the sketch on the table.\n\n\n\"If you build your own bank, you must build all of this. Branches in every city where you need to move money. Clerks who can be trusted with vast sums. Guards for the transfers that cannot be avoided. Systems for reconciliation, for accounting, for detecting fraud.\" He pauses. \"It can be done. The Bardi did it. The Peruzzi did it.\"\n\n\nA dry smile.\n\n\n\"They also both collapsed when Edward of England defaulted on his loans. The Medici have survived because we learned from their mistakes.

Let me think about what Cosimo would want here and how he would respond.\n\nWhat Cosimo wants:\n1. To maintain the Medici bank's independence and neutrality\n2. To profit from the enormous wealth flowing through Juan's empire\n3. To expand into new territories (Constantinople is a fascinating opportunity)\n4. To have security - knowing Juan won't suddenly withdraw everything and collapse the bank\n5. To maintain his reputation with other clients\n\nWhat Juan is offering:\n1. A guaranteed 300,000 florin deposit that can only be withdrawn at 30,000/year over 10 years - this is EXCELLENT for Cosimo as it gives him stable working capital\n2. Continued business relationship\n3. Expansion opportunities into Constantinople and other parts of the empire\n4. A new currency (the Iota) that he must distribute - this is interesting, it essentially makes the Medici bank an arm of Castilian monetary policy\n5. Quarterly deposits of excess funds to Toledo/Madrid - meaning Juan IS building his own central treasury\n\nWhat Cosimo would be thinking:\n- The 300,000 florin locked deposit is very attractive - that's stable capital he can lend out\n- But the requirement to pay out in Iota is politically sensitive - it makes him an agent of Castilian monetary expansion\n- Constantinople is a risky but potentially lucrative market\n- The \"new system\" for tax assessors is vague but suggests Juan is building infrastructure that might eventually replace Medici services\n- Juan is essentially creating a hybrid system - using Medici for international transfers while building his own treasury capacity\n\nCosimo would need to negotiate:\n1. Transaction fees (the cambium) - typically 2-3% as he mentioned\n2. What does \"rent\" mean in this context? Perhaps Juan means fees for holding/managing funds?\n3. The Iota requirement is problematic - other clients may not want to be paid in Castilian currency\n4. Constantinople expansion costs - who bears the risk of setting up new branches?\n\n\n5. The Iota requirement could alienate other clients and compromise his neutrality - this is the real sticking point. Juan seems to be building toward eventually not needing the Medici at all, which means Cosimo needs to ensure this arrangement doesn't leave him dependent on Castilian goodwill while also protecting his reputation with other banking partners.\n\nFor his response, Cosimo should express enthusiasm about Constantinople while accepting the locked deposit, but he needs to firmly push back on distributing the Iota—that's too politically risky for a neutral institution. He should propose concrete fee structures and clarify what \"rent\" entails.\n\n\nCosimo is silent for a long moment. You watch him calculate—not with paper and quill, but behind those dark eyes, weighing costs and benefits with the speed of a man who has done such arithmetic since boyhood.\n\n\n\"You have thought about this,\" he says finally.

Less the philosopher, more the merchant approaching a negotiation he intends to win.\n\n\n\"Let me take your proposals in order.\"\n\n\nHe returns to his seat, ticking off fingers as he speaks.\n\n\n\"First: Constantinople. Yes. You are correct that we have no presence there, and you are correct that this is an oversight given your... involvement. The Greek trade, the Black Sea routes, the opportunities that will emerge if the city survives—\" He nods slowly. \"I am interested. Establishing a branch there would require capital, personnel, relationships with local powers. It is not a small undertaking. But for access to an empire that spans from the Atlantic to the Bosphorus...\" A slight shrug. \"The investment is justified.

Generous and wise. You understand that guaranteed capital allows us to extend more credit, take more risk, serve you better. I accept this term without reservation.\"\n\n\nA third finger, and here his expression grows more guarded.\n\n\n\"The Iota.\"\n\n\nHe picks up one of the coins again, turning it in the lamplight.\n\n\n\"You ask me to distribute your currency throughout my network. To pay your subjects in coin stamped with your symbol, your name, your authority.\" He sets it down. \"You understand what you are asking. Every Iota that passes through Medici hands carries your image into markets where Castilian power is... not universally welcomed. France. England. The Italian states that eye your expansion with concern.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"I am not refusing. The coin is good weight, good metal—it will spend as well as any florin. But you are asking me to become, in some small way, an instrument of Castilian policy. My other clients will notice. Some will object.\" A pause. \"For this, I require consideration. Not a fee—something else. A guarantee that the Iota will maintain its weight and purity for the duration of our arrangement. That you will not debase it to fund a war and leave me holding worthless metal that I distributed in good faith. I have seen kings do this, Your Majesty. It destroyed the Bardi.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\n\"Give me that guarantee in writing—a royal charter, perhaps, witnessed by your treasurer and your confessor—and I will distribute your Iota wherever it is practical to do so.\"\n\n\nA fourth finger.\n\n\n\"Transaction fees. The standard cambium is two to three percent, as I mentioned. For volumes such as yours, I can offer two percent for routine transfers within your territories. For transfers to hostile or difficult markets—France, England, the German states—three percent, to account for the additional risk and complexity.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, considering.\n\n\n\"For Constantinople, until the branch is established and profitable, I would ask three percent as well. The risk is higher. Once operations stabilize—say, after three years—we can revisit.\"\n\n\nA fifth finger.\n\n\n\"The quarterly deposits to your central treasury. This I understand. You are building your own capacity—this is prudent. I ask only reasonable notice before large withdrawals, so that we may manage our liquidity. Say, thirty days for sums exceeding fifty thousand florins.\"\n\n\nHe sits back, folding his hands.\n\n\n\"As for rent—if you mean a fee for simply holding your funds beyond the three hundred thousand guaranteed deposit—I propose we waive it entirely. Your business is valuable enough that I will not nickel you for vault space.\" A dry smile. \"Consider it a courtesy between partners.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes directly.\n\n\n\"These are my terms, Your Majesty. They are fair, I think—perhaps generous, given the uncertainties involved. But I have one question before we proceed.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward slightly.\n\n\n\"This 'new system' you mention. The one that will make it easier for your assessors to communicate with banks. You have been admirably specific about everything else, but on this you are vague.\" His eyes sharpen. \"What are you building, exactly? And how much of what I currently provide will it eventually replace?\""

Let me first read the persuasion skill document to understand how to properly construct this table.\n\nThe user is negotiating with Cosimo de' Medici about:\n1. Using the Iota coin to pay Juan's subjects (not foreign clients) - this is a clarification that makes it more reasonable\n2. Keeping 300,000 florins deposited with guaranteed liquidity over 10 years\n3. Asking what interest rate Cosimo will offer on this deposit\n\nThis is a negotiation about interest rates on a large, guaranteed deposit. Juan is offering something valuable (stable capital) and asking for favorable terms in return.\n\nLet me read the persuasion skill to construct this properly.\n\n\nView: Reading the persuasion skill to construct the d100 table properly\n\n\nThought process: Analyzed negotiation leverage and constructed persuasion mechanics framework.\n\nNow I need to construct a d100 table for this negotiation. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**What Juan is asking:**\n1. Clarification: The Iota will only be used to pay Juan's subjects within his territories, not foreign clients - this is a reasonable clarification that significantly reduces Cosimo's risk\n2. Interest rate on the 300,000 florin deposit that is locked for 10 years (30,000/year liquidation)\n\n**The Ask (Step 1):**\nJuan is negotiating for a favorable interest rate on a guaranteed, long-term deposit. He's also offering a reasonable clarification on the Iota issue that should relieve Cosimo's concerns.\n\n**Juan's Approach Quality (Step 2):**\n- **Argument quality:** Strong. Juan has clarified a legitimate concern Cosimo raised. He's offering stable, guaranteed capital that a banker desperately wants.\n- **Cultural appropriateness:** Good. This is a straightforward business negotiation between peers.\n- **Benefits offered:** Significant. 300,000 florins locked for 10 years is extremely valuable working capital for a bank.\n- **Concerns addressed:** Yes - Juan directly addressed the Iota concern about foreign clients\n- **Face-saving:** Good - Juan isn't demanding, he's negotiating\n- **Respect shown:** Yes - Juan came to Cosimo rather than summoning him\n\n**Success Factors:**\n1. 300,000 florins guaranteed for 10 years is EXTREMELY valuable - this is stable capital a bank can lend against\n2. Juan clarified the Iota concern - it's much more reasonable now\n3. Juan is offering ongoing business across a five-crown empire\n4. The Medici need to maintain relationship with the most powerful king in the Mediterranean\n5. Juan's approach has been direct, respectful, and businesslike\n6. Constantinople expansion opportunity is attractive\n7. This is a negotiation, not a demand - Cosimo has room to propose terms\n\n\n8. Cosimo will face pressure from profit margins since every percentage point of interest costs real money, and he's unlikely to offer generous terms when Juan appears committed to the arrangement. The Iota still carries administrative overhead, and Cosimo is known for driving hard bargains that protect his bottom line.\n\nJuan's request is reasonable—depositors with large, stable capital typically expect returns, especially when offering security guarantees. The real question becomes what rate Cosimo will actually agree to. Juan holds significant leverage through his substantial deposit, expanding influence, and alternative banking options, but Cosimo's negotiating skill means he won't surrender profits without resistance. Juan's direct, professional approach should position him well for favorable terms on strong rolls, though weaker results might yield less advantageous but still functional rates.\n\nMedieval banking precedent suggests deposits typically earned 5-12% interest through various mechanisms that circumvented Church restrictions on usury. For a deposit of Juan's size and reliability, 4-6% would be quite favorable; 2-4% represents standard terms; anything below 2% signals Cosimo attempting to extract maximum advantage.\n\n\nPersuasion Analysis: Negotiating Interest Rate with Cosimo de' Medici\n\n\n\nThe Ask:\nJuan requests a favorable interest rate on 300,000 florins deposited with guaranteed 10-year liquidation terms, while clarifying that the Iota requirement applies only to his own subjects within his territories—not to Medici's foreign clients.\n\n\nJuan's Approach Quality:\n\n\nArgument quality: Strong. The clarification on the Iota directly addresses Cosimo's stated concern about neutrality. The deposit offer provides stable working capital any banker would value highly.\n\nBenefits offered: Substantial. Guaranteed capital for 10 years, ongoing business from a five-crown empire, Constantinople expansion opportunity.\n\nConcerns addressed: Yes—Juan immediately clarified the Iota issue without being asked twice.\n\nRespect shown: Juan came to Cosimo personally, negotiated as equals, and has been direct without demanding.\n\nLeverage demonstrated: Juan made clear he can withdraw and start his own bank—he has alternatives.\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nGuaranteed capital is gold to a banker — 300,000 florins locked for 10 years allows Medici to lend confidently against it\n\nClarification removes major concern — Iota only for Juan's subjects eliminates neutrality problem\n\nOngoing imperial business — Five crowns means volumes that dwarf most clients\n\nConstantinople opportunity — New market access Cosimo admitted interests him\n\nJuan has alternatives — He can start his own bank; Cosimo knows this\n\nProfessional approach — Direct negotiation between sophisticated parties\n\nRelationship value — Losing Juan to a competitor would be a significant blow\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nEvery percent costs real money — Interest paid is profit lost; Cosimo guards his margins fiercely\n\nBanking practice minimizes deposit interest — Standard approach is to pay as little as possible\n\nCosimo smells commitment — Juan came in person, clearly wants a deal; leverage to extract\n\nMedici reputation for hard bargains — Cosimo did not become the richest man in Florence by being generous\n\nAdministrative costs of Iota — Even limited to Juan's subjects, this creates complexity\n\n\n\nAssessment:\nThis is a reasonable negotiation between parties who both want a deal. Juan's approach has been strong—direct, informed, addressing concerns proactively. Cosimo has incentive to offer fair terms to keep this enormous client, but he will not offer generous terms out of goodwill. The roll determines how hard Cosimo bargains and what rate he ultimately proposes.\n\n\nHistorical context: Medieval banking interest on deposits typically ranged from 4-10% for large, stable depositors. Church restrictions on \"usury\" meant these were often framed as \"discretionary gifts\" or profit-sharing rather than guaranteed rates.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll: Interest Rate Negotiation\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nHardball. Cosimo offers 2% annually—barely above token. He emphasizes that he is providing Juan a service, not the reverse. The deposit is convenient but not essential to Medici operations. He is testing whether Juan will walk away.\n11-25\nStandard Terms. Cosimo offers 3% annually—the rate he would offer any large depositor. Polite, professional, but no special consideration. He frames this as fair market rate and implies Juan should be grateful for the stability Medici provides.\n26-45\nRespectful but Firm. Cosimo offers 4% annually, acknowledging the value of guaranteed capital. He notes this is above his standard rate but appropriate for a \"partner of such significance.\" Some room for minor negotiation remains.\n46-70\nFair Partnership. Cosimo offers 5% annually, explicitly recognizing that Juan's clarification on the Iota resolved his concerns and that the guaranteed deposit is genuinely valuable. He frames this as the beginning of a profitable relationship for both parties.\n71-85\nFavorable Terms. Cosimo offers 6% annually, noting that he rarely offers such rates but that Juan has proven himself \"a king who understands banking better than most bankers.\" He adds a small sweetener—perhaps reduced transaction fees for the first year.\n86-95\nGenerous Partnership. Cosimo offers 6% plus additional considerations—perhaps 1.5% transaction fees within Juan's territories instead of 2%, or priority service guarantees. He admits frankly that keeping Juan's business is worth more than the margin he's surrendering.\n96-100\nExceptional Terms. Cosimo offers 7% and openly states that he is investing in a relationship, not just a transaction. He proposes quarterly meetings to discuss opportunities, offers Medici intelligence on Italian politics as a courtesy, and suggests they might collaborate on ventures beyond simple banking. He has decided Juan is worth cultivating as an ally, not merely serving as a client.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

Cosimo would be interested in this because:\n1. It represents massive potential future business\n2. It shows Juan is thinking systematically about integrating banking into his empire's commerce\n3.

A system where the Crown sees every transaction of significance. Where tax evasion becomes nearly impossible. Where the flow of commerce is visible to those who control the banks.\" He meets your eyes. \"You understand, I hope, what that means. Such a system is a tool of extraordinary power.

      "say": "Thought process: Charted Florence-to-Poland route through multiple geographical and political considerations.\n\nThe player wants to travel from Florence to Poland. This is indeed a substantial journey - Florence is in central Italy, and Poland is in Eastern Europe. Let me think about the logical sections for this journey.\n\nLooking at the geography and the political situation in 1439:\n\n1. **Florence to Venice** - This is a natural first leg. Venice is a major power, controls much of the Adriatic, and is on the way northeast. Juan might have diplomatic business there, or at least pass through. It's also where the Council of Florence is currently meeting (the Council moved from Basel to Ferrara in 1438, then to Florence in 1439 due to plague).\n\n2. **Venice to Hungary** - Hungary under King Władysław III (who is also King of Poland - he holds both crowns!) is a crucial stop. Actually, wait - the player said they're going to Poland, and they mentioned meeting King Władysław III in the chapter summary. Władysław III of Poland became King of Hungary in 1440, but in 1439... let me think. Actually, Albert II of Habsburg was King of Hungary and he died in October 1439. Władysław III was elected King of Hungary in 1440.\n\nIn 1439, the situation is:\n- Poland: King Władysław III (since 1434, age ~15 in 1439)\n- Hungary: King Albert II (Habsburg) - but he's about to die in October 1439\n\nSo if Juan is traveling in late July/August 1439, Albert II is still King of Hungary. Władysław III is King of Poland only at this point.\n\nLet me reconsider the route:\n\n**Florence to Poland in 1439:**\n\nOption A - Land route through the Alps and German lands:\n1. Florence → Alps → German lands (Bavaria/Austria)\n2. Through Bohemia or Austria\n3. Into Poland (Kraków)\n\nOption B - Sea route part of the way:\n1. Florence → Venice (by land through Romagna)\n\n\n2. Venice → by sea up the Adriatic, then overland through Hungary or skirting around it into Poland\n\nOption C - The more direct overland route:\n1. Florence → Venice\n2. Venice → through Carinthia/Styria (Austrian lands)\n3. Through Moravia/Silesia into Poland\n\nFor a king with a 500-man entourage, the land route makes most sense, though it's arduous. The most practical approach would be Florence to Venice as the first major stop, then either pushing through the Austrian territories or taking the Adriatic route depending on conditions and diplomatic needs.\n\nFrom Venice, the path splits into Alpine passes leading through Habsburg-controlled lands—cities like Villach or Vienna could serve as waypoints. Then it's into Bohemian or Moravian territory, where Sigismund or Albert II hold power depending on the year. Finally, the journey concludes in Kraków where Władysław III maintains his court.\n\nBefore mapping out the full route, I should understand what the player actually wants from this journey—whether they're racing to Poland, stopping for diplomatic meetings in Venice or Hungary, seeking encounters with specific rulers, or just rolling through with travel complications.\n\n\nA wise approach. Florence to Poland is over a thousand miles through diverse and politically complex territories.\n\n\nLet me propose logical sections based on geography and diplomatic significance:\n\n\n\nPROPOSED JOURNEY SECTIONS:\n\n\n1. Florence to Venice (5-7 days)\n\n\nThrough the Romagna and Po Valley\n\nVenice is a major power, controls Adriatic trade, and has significant interests in Constantinople\n\nDiplomatic stop? Or pass through quickly?\n\n\n2. Venice through the Alpine Passes (10-14 days)\n\n\nInto Habsburg lands (Carinthia, Styria, or through the Brenner)\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire is currently in flux—Albert II of Habsburg holds Hungary and Bohemia, but Emperor Sigismund died in 1437\n\nPotential stops: Villach, Graz, or Vienna\n\n\n3. Through Bohemia or Moravia (7-10 days)\n\n\nAlbert II's lands—he is King of Bohemia and Hungary\n\nThe Hussite wars have scarred this region; religious tensions remain\n\nPrague or Brno as potential waypoints\n\n\n4. Into Poland—Arrival at Kraków (5-7 days)\n\n\nThe court of King Władysław III awaits\n\nKraków is the Polish capital, seat of the Jagiellonian dynasty\n\n\n\nQuestions for you:\n\n\nDo you want diplomatic encounters in Venice or the Habsburg lands, or is this primarily travel to reach Władysław?\n\nShould we do detailed chaos rolls for each section, or a single roll for the overall journey with narrative summary?\n\nIs the full 500-man embassy still traveling with you, or did you leave some in Florence/send them home?"

Your column stretches for nearly a league—five hundred men, horses, mules, wagons—crawling through mountain passes where the air shimmers with heat. The views are spectacular; the experience is miserable. Men drink their waterskins dry by midday and refill at every stream.\n\n\nBologna receives you correctly but without enthusiasm. The city is technically papal territory, and the legate ensures you are fed, housed, and moved along with efficient haste. No one wants a foreign army—however friendly—lingering in their streets.\n\n\nFerrara is different.\n\n\nWord of your approach reaches the d'Este court before you do, and Marquess Niccolò III—Lucia's uncle, aging now but still sharp—rides out personally to meet you at the border of his territory. The welcome is genuine: fresh horses, cold wine, a night in the castello where servants who remember Lucia ask after her health and that of the children. You share a meal with the old Marquess, who studies you with eyes that have seen decades of Italian politics.\n\n\n\"She chose well,\" he says at one point, apropos of nothing. \"My niece. I was not certain, when the Castilian delegation came. But she chose well.\"\n\n\nHe does not elaborate. You leave Ferrara the next morning with supplies replenished and morale restored.\n\n\nThe final stretch across the Veneto plain is flat, hot, and tedious. Padua passes in a blur of ancient university buildings and curious scholars.\n\n\nAnd then—Venice.\n\n\nThe Venetians have been watching you since you entered their territory, of course. Their intelligence service is legendary. By the time you reach the lagoon, a delegation awaits: minor nobles in silk and velvet, their smiles warm, their eyes cataloguing everything. How many men. What condition. What banners. What weapons.\n\n\nThey offer accommodation, guides, transport across the lagoon to the city itself. They ask—with exquisite politeness—the purpose of your journey, your intended route, your business in the East. They mention, casually, that the Doge would be honored to receive you should your schedule permit.\n\n\nYou deflect gracefully. You are merely passing through. Affairs of state call you northward. Perhaps on the return journey.\n\n\nThey accept this with equal grace, and equal disbelief.\n\n\nTwo days in Venetian territory—enough to rest the men and arrange passage around the lagoon—and then north, toward the Alps.\n\n\n\nSECTION 2: VENICE THROUGH THE ALPINE PASSES\nEarly to Mid-August 1439\n\n\nRoute: Venice → Treviso → Belluno → Pieve di Cadore → through the Carnic or Dolomite passes → Villach → into Habsburg Styria/Carinthia\nDistance: Approximately 200 miles\nExpected Duration: 10-14 days\nTerrain: Flat Veneto → foothills → serious Alpine crossing → descent into Austrian lands\n\n\n\nRisk-Reducing Factors:\n\n\nAugust is the best month for Alpine crossing\n\nEstablished trade routes through the passes\n\n150 armed men deter brigands\n\nFunds to hire local guides\n\nHabsburg lands are nominally friendly (no active conflict)\n\n\nRisk-Increasing Factors:\n\n\n500 men through mountain passes—logistical nightmare\n\nMules and wagons struggle on steep grades\n\nWeather in the Alps is unpredictable even in summer\n\nHabsburg administration may demand tolls, papers, explanations\n\nAlbert II holds these lands but is occupied with Hungarian affairs; local lords may be... creative\n\n\n\nd100 Table: Venice through the Alpine Passes\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDisaster.

A pass is blocked or unsafe; major detour required. Habsburg officials are obstructive—loss of time, money, and patience. Arrive exhausted and weeks behind schedule.\n13-25\nHard Crossing. The mountains exact their toll. Horses go lame, wagons break, men suffer altitude sickness. Local lords extract steep tolls. Progress is slow and painful.\n26-45\nStandard Alpine Passage. Difficult but manageable. Guides prove competent; weather holds mostly. Habsburg tolls are annoying but not ruinous. Arrive tired but intact, roughly on schedule.\n46-65\nCompetent Crossing. Good guides, adequate weather. The column handles the mountains better than expected. Habsburg officials are correct and efficient. Arrive in good order.\n66-80\nSmooth Passage.

Let me narrate this section and then set up the next table for Bohemia/Moravia.\n\n\nRoll: 65 — Competent Crossing\n\n\n\nThe Alps rise before you like the walls of God's own fortress.\n\n\nYour Venetian guides—hired at considerable expense, worth every ducat—lead the column north through the Veneto foothills, where vineyards give way to forests and the air begins to cool. By the time you reach Belluno, the mountains dominate the horizon, their peaks still carrying traces of snow even in high summer.\n\n\nThe ascent begins in earnest beyond Pieve di Cadore. The road—such as it is—winds through valleys carved by ancient rivers, climbing steadily toward the Carnic passes. Your wagons groan on the grades; the muleteers curse in three languages; the horses' breath steams in the thin morning air despite the August date.\n\n\nBut the weather holds. This is the gift of summer in the Alps—long days, clear skies, passes that would be death traps in winter now merely difficult rather than impossible. Your guides know every switchback, every stable stream crossing, every village where five hundred men can find shelter and fodder.\n\n\nThe column stretches and compresses like a living thing as it navigates the terrain. You lose two mules to a loose scree slope—their loads recovered, the animals not—and one wagon breaks an axle that takes half a day to repair. These are acceptable losses. The mountains demand their toll; you pay it and press on.\n\n\nAt the highest point of the crossing, you pause to let the men rest and the horses breathe. The view stretches endlessly in both directions—Italy behind you, the German lands ahead, the peaks marching away to east and west like frozen waves. Your standard-bearer plants the banner of Castile on a rocky outcrop, and for a moment five hundred men stand in silence, contemplating the sheer scale of the world.\n\n\nThen down, into lands where the language shifts and the architecture changes and the signs of Habsburg administration appear: toll stations, border markers, officials in livery that carries the eagle.\n\n\nThe Habsburg functionaries are correct and efficient. They examine your documents—letters of passage prepared in Florence—ask pointed questions about your destination and purpose, and assess tolls that are steep but not outrageous. One official, an older man with the bearing of a minor noble, recognizes the significance of your banners and offers a slight bow that his colleagues do not match.\n\n\n\"The King of Castile travels far from home,\" he observes. \"Poland, is it? The young Jagiellon will be honored.\"\n\n\nHe does not ask why. He does not need to. Everyone in Christendom knows why a king with five crowns and a claim to Constantinople might seek alliance with the power that borders the Ottomans' northern flank.\n\n\nBy mid-August, you descend into the valleys of Carinthia—Villach, then northeast toward Styria. The land is green, prosperous, dotted with castles and monasteries. The people watch your column pass with curiosity but no hostility. You are clearly not invaders; you are clearly going somewhere else.\n\n\nThe Alps are behind you. The next challenge lies ahead: the lands of Bohemia, still scarred by decades of Hussite warfare, and beyond them, Poland.\n\n\n\nSECTION 3: THROUGH BOHEMIA OR MORAVIA\nMid to Late August 1439\n\n\nRoute: Styria → Vienna (brief) → north through Moravia → toward the Polish border\nDistance: Approximately 250 miles\nExpected Duration: 7-10 days\nTerrain: Rolling Austrian farmland → Moravian hills → approach to Polish frontier\n\n\nPolitical Context:\n\n\nAlbert II of Habsburg is King of Bohemia and Hungary, but his hold is contested\n\nThe Hussite Wars (1419-1434) devastated Bohemia; religious tensions remain\n\nMoravia is more stable but still wary of large armed forces\n\nYou are passing through, not stopping—but locals may not immediately believe this\n\n\n\nRisk-Reducing Factors:\n\n\nSummer weather continues favorable\n\nMajor roads through Moravia are well-maintained\n\nHabsburg authority nominally controls these lands\n\n150 armed men deter casual trouble\n\nNo religious conflict with Hussites (you're Catholic but not Crusading against them)\n\n\nRisk-Increasing Factors:\n\n\n500 foreign soldiers in lands still traumatized by war\n\nLocal lords may be suspicious or opportunistic\n\nHussite remnants still active in some areas\n\nAlbert II is in Hungary dealing with Ottoman pressure—local authority unclear\n\nLanguage barriers increasing\n\n\n\nd100 Table: Through Bohemia/Moravia\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nSerious Incident. Mistaken for hostile force or caught in local conflict. Armed confrontation, possible casualties. Major diplomatic damage control required. Significant delay.\n6-15\nTense Passage. Local lords deny passage or demand excessive tribute. Hussite communities bar gates and watch from walls. Progress requires constant negotiation and occasional threats. Exhausting and slow.\n16-30\nDifficult Transit. Suspicion everywhere. Villages empty at your approach; supplies hard to purchase at any price. Local officials are obstructive. Arrive at Polish border tired and frustrated.\n31-50\nUneasy but Uneventful. The column moves through lands that watch it warily. No incidents, but no welcome either. Supplies adequate, progress steady. The tension only lifts when Poland comes into view.\n51-70\nCorrect Passage. Habsburg officials, informed of your coming, ensure cooperation. Local lords maintain polite distance. Moravian towns provide supplies at fair prices. Unremarkable but efficient.\n71-85\nSmooth Transit. Albert II's administration proves more effective than expected. A royal letter of safe-conduct catches up with you, smoothing all difficulties. Local nobles offer cautious hospitality.\n86-95\nFavorable Reception. Word of the King of Five Crowns spreads ahead. Moravian lords compete to host you; one provides valuable intelligence about Polish court politics. Arrive at the border well-rested and well-informed.\n96-100\nUnexpected Opportunity. A Habsburg official or Moravian noble seeks private audience—an alliance proposal, intelligence offer, or diplomatic opening you did not anticipate. The journey yields more than safe passage.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

Arrive at Polish border tired and frustrated.\"\n\nThis is a challenging but not disastrous result. I should narrate the difficulties of passing through Moravia - the lingering trauma of the Hussite Wars, suspicious locals, supply problems, obstructive officials. The column gets through but it's hard going.\n\nThen I need to draft the final table for the last section: arrival in Poland and journey to Kraków.\n\n\nRoll: 17 — Difficult Transit\n\n\n\nVienna is a blur—two nights, no more. The Habsburg capital is preoccupied with its own concerns; Albert II is in Hungary, and the officials who remain have little interest in a foreign king passing through. You replenish what supplies you can, pay the requisite fees, and push north into Moravia.\n\n\nThe change is immediate.\n\n\nThe land itself is fertile enough—rolling hills, dark forests, fields of grain ripening toward harvest. But something is wrong. Something you feel before you understand.\n\n\nThe first village you approach empties before your vanguard arrives. Doors slam. Shutters close. The streets are deserted save for a single old woman too slow or too stubborn to flee, who watches your column pass with eyes that have seen worse than foreign soldiers.\n\n\n\"Křížáci,\" someone mutters from behind a wall. Crusaders.\n\n\nYour interpreters explain: the Hussite Wars ended only five years ago. For fifteen years before that, armies flying Catholic banners burned their way across these lands, and armies flying the Hussite chalice burned back. Every village lost sons. Every town bears scars. A column of five hundred armed men, flying the banners of a king who styles himself Defensor Romaniae—to them, you might as well be carrying torches.\n\n\nIt does not matter that you are merely passing through. It does not matter that you have no quarrel with Hussites. The trauma runs too deep for reason.\n\n\n\nSupplies become a constant struggle.\n\n\nMarkets close at your approach. Farmers hide their grain. The few merchants willing to deal demand prices that border on extortion—and your quartermasters pay, because the alternative is foraging, and foraging in these lands would confirm every fear these people harbor.\n\n\nYour men grow frustrated. They do not understand why peasants flee from them, why innkeepers claim to have no rooms, why blacksmiths refuse to shoe horses. Some of the younger soldiers mutter about teaching respect. You shut that talk down hard. One incident—one burned barn, one struck peasant—and you will have confirmed that the Crusaders have returned.\n\n\nThe local officials are worse than useless. Habsburg authority here is thin, resented, frequently ignored. The nobles who actually control these lands view your passage as someone else's problem—and if extracting fees and causing delays encourages you to become someone else's problem faster, so much the better.\n\n\nAt Olomouc, the largest town on your route, the city fathers close the gates entirely. No explanation. No negotiation. Your heralds stand before walls that saw siege warfare within living memory, and the answer is simply no.\n\n\nYou detour. Two days lost.\n\n\n\nThe column begins to fray.\n\n\nNot dangerously—your officers are competent, your discipline holds—but the endless suspicion wears on men's spirits. They are tired. They are hungry. They are far from home, in lands that treat them like plague carriers. The camaraderie of the Italian journey, the pride of the Alpine crossing, gives way to grim endurance.\n\n\nAt one point, passing through a forest, your scouts report movement in the trees. Armed men, watching. Not attacking—just watching. Hussite remnants? Bandits? Local militia ensuring you leave? You never find out. Your column tightens formation and presses on, and the watchers melt away.\n\n\nBy the time the terrain begins to flatten toward the Polish frontier, your supplies are depleted, your horses are tired, and your men are operating on stubbornness rather than enthusiasm.\n\n\nBut you are through.\n\n\nThe last Moravian toll station—manned by officials who barely glance at your documents before waving you on, clearly relieved to see you go—marks the border. Beyond lies Poland. Beyond lies Kraków, and young King Władysław III, and whatever alliance might be forged there.\n\n\nBehind you, Moravia closes like a wound healing. The villages will emerge from behind their shutters. The markets will reopen. And the stories will spread: the King of Five Crowns passed through with an army, and we survived.\n\n\nYou do not think they will remember you fondly.\n\n\n\nSECTION 4: INTO POLAND — ARRIVAL AT KRAKÓW\nLate August to Early September 1439\n\n\nRoute: Moravian border → through Lesser Poland → Kraków\nDistance: Approximately 150 miles\nExpected Duration: 5-7 days\nTerrain: Gentle hills giving way to Polish plains; good roads toward the capital\n\n\nPolitical Context:\n\n\nWładysław III Jagiellon, age 15, King of Poland since 1434\n\nThe Jagiellonian dynasty rules both Poland and Lithuania (personal union)\n\nPoland borders the Teutonic Knights (north), Hungary (south), and has interests in the Black Sea region\n\nWładysław is young, ambitious, and surrounded by competing factions of advisors\n\nYour visit has been announced; you are expected\n\n\n\nRisk-Reducing Factors:\n\n\nYou are an invited guest; Poland expects you\n\nPolish roads to Kraków are well-maintained\n\nNo recent warfare in this region\n\nCatholic kingdom; no religious tension\n\nThe Poles are curious about the famous King of Five Crowns\n\nWładysław needs allies against Ottoman pressure as much as you do\n\n\nRisk-Increasing Factors:\n\n\nYour column is battered from the Moravian passage\n\nPolish nobles will judge your bearing and strength\n\nCourt factions may try to approach you before you reach Władysław\n\nArriving tired and depleted is not the impression you wanted to make\n\n500 men still require feeding and housing\n\n\n\nd100 Table: Arrival in Poland\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nInauspicious Arrival. Further misfortune—illness, accident, or diplomatic incident—mars the final approach. You arrive at Kraków diminished, and the Polish court notices. First impressions are poor.\n6-15\nLimping Finish. The column barely holds together. You arrive exhausted, undersupplied, and visibly worn. Polish hospitality is generous but the court whispers about the state of the famous king's embassy.\n16-30\nTired Arrival. No disasters, but no recovery either. You reach Kraków functional but clearly battered by the journey. The Poles are polite; some are privately unimpressed.\n31-50\nAdequate Recovery. Polish territory allows the column to rest and resupply. By the time you reach Kraków, you have recovered some dignity. The arrival is neither grand nor embarrassing.\n51-70\nRespectable Arrival. The contrast with Moravia is stark—Polish towns welcome the famous king. Time to rest, resupply, and restore order. You enter Kraków looking like a monarch, not a refugee.\n71-85\nStrong Recovery. Polish hospitality erases the Moravian difficulties. Local nobles ride out to greet you; supplies are pressed upon you as gifts. You arrive at Kraków with your reputation intact and your men refreshed.\n86-95\nImpressive Entrance. Word of your journey spreads; the Moravian passage becomes a story of endurance rather than struggle. Polish nobles compete to host you. You enter Kraków as a king who has crossed mountains and hostile lands to seek alliance.\n96-100\nTriumphant Arrival. The young King Władysław himself rides out to meet you before you reach the capital—an extraordinary honor. The Polish court is already half-won before negotiations begin. Your reputation precedes you in the best possible way.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

Let me narrate this final leg of the journey and set up the arrival at the Polish court.\n\n\nRoll: 34 — Adequate Recovery\n\n\n\nThe border crossing into Poland is unmarked save for a wooden post carved with the White Eagle—but you feel the difference immediately.\n\n\nThe first Polish village does not empty at your approach. Instead, people emerge to watch, curious rather than fearful. Children point at your banners. A woman offers water from a well, waving away payment. An old man who fought against the Teutonic Knights in his youth studies your soldiers with professional interest and nods approval at their discipline.\n\n\nYou are still five hundred armed foreigners in a land not your own. But here, that is a curiosity rather than a threat.\n\n\n\nThe roads improve. The supplies flow.\n\n\nPolish hospitality is not lavish—this is not a wealthy land—but it is genuine. Local lords send representatives to inquire after your needs. Towns open their markets. Blacksmiths shoe your horses at fair prices. For the first time since leaving Venice, your quartermasters report adequate stocks.\n\n\nYour men begin to recover. The haunted wariness of the Moravian passage fades, replaced by something approaching normalcy. Horses that were stumbling find their stride. Soldiers who were snapping at each other begin to joke again. The column tightens, straightens, remembers that it represents five crowns.\n\n\nBut the damage cannot be fully undone in five days.\n\n\nThe horses are rested, not fresh. The men are functional, not sharp. The wagons have been repaired, but they creak and groan in ways that suggest deeper problems. Your finest clothes—packed for the royal audience—have survived the journey, but some of your officers will be presenting themselves in patched cloaks and scuffed boots.\n\n\nYou are not arriving as a refugee. But neither are you arriving as a conqueror.\n\n\n\nKraków emerges from the Polish plain on a bright September morning.\n\n\nThe city is larger than you expected—a true capital, sprawling along the Vistula River, dominated by the great mass of Wawel Castle on its limestone hill. Church spires punctuate the skyline. The famous Cloth Hall anchors a market square that rivals any in Christendom. This is not some frontier outpost; this is the seat of a dynasty that rules from the Baltic to the Black Sea.\n\n\nThe Polish delegation that meets you outside the city walls is correct and welcoming, if not effusive. Minor nobles, city officials, a bishop who blesses your arrival in sonorous Latin. They have prepared lodgings for your embassy—a palace near the castle, sufficient if not luxurious—and they inform you that King Władysław will receive you tomorrow, after you have had time to rest from your journey.\n\n\nTomorrow. Not today.\n\n\nYou are not sure if this is genuine consideration for your comfort or a subtle message about your place in the young king's priorities. Perhaps both.\n\n\n\nYour men file into Kraków in reasonable order. The Poles line the streets to watch—merchants, craftsmen, students from the famous university, soldiers who assess your troops with knowing eyes. You sit your horse straight-backed, wearing your finest that survived the journey, the banner of Castile snapping above you.\n\n\nThe whispers follow you through the streets.\n\n\n\"Five crowns...\"\n\n\n\"...conquered Granada...\"\n\n\n\"...Defensor Romaniae...\"\n\n\n\"...so young...\"\n\n\nThey have heard of you. The stories have traveled faster than your column. But stories are not the same as seeing, and what they see is a king who has clearly come a long way through hard country to reach them.\n\n\nWhether that earns respect or raises questions, you cannot yet tell.\n\n\n\nKRAKÓW — EVENING, EARLY SEPTEMBER 1439\n\n\nYou stand at the window of your assigned chambers, looking out over the city as the sun sets. Wawel Castle rises above you, its windows glowing with candlelight. Somewhere in there, a fifteen-year-old king is preparing to meet you.\n\n\nWładysław III. Boy-king of Poland and Lithuania.

      "say": "Thought process: Contextualized historical setting and prepared authentic court scene.\n\nThe user wants to:\n1. Work out protocol with the Polish officials\n2. Have an audience with King Władysław III\n\nLet me think about this situation:\n\n- Władysław III is 15 years old (born October 31, 1424, so he's almost 15 in September 1439)\n- He's been King of Poland since 1434 (age 10)\n- He's surrounded by advisors and factions\n- Juan has come to discuss alliance, likely regarding Ottoman threats and crusade\n- Juan's reputation precedes him but he arrived somewhat battered\n\nI should:\n1. Briefly narrate the protocol discussion\n2. Set the scene for the audience\n3. Introduce Władysław and his court\n4. Have the young king speak to Juan and then STOP to let the player respond\n\nI need to make Władysław realistic - a 15-year-old king who has been ruling (nominally) for 5 years. He's young but not stupid. He's surrounded by powerful advisors who have their own interests. The Jagiellonian dynasty is relatively new to the Polish throne.\n\nKey figures who might be present:\n- Zbigniew Oleśnicki - Bishop of Kraków, very powerful, conservative, influential in Władysław's council\n- Various Polish nobles (magnates)\n\nLet me research a bit about the Polish court in 1439 to make this authentic.\n\nActually, I should note that historically, Władysław III would later become King of Hungary as well (1440) and die at the Battle of Varna (1444) fighting the Ottomans. So there's historical precedent for him being interested in crusading against the Ottomans.\n\nThe key advisor is definitely Zbigniew Oleśnicki, Bishop of Kraków - he was the most powerful figure in Poland during Władysław's minority and continued to be influential. He was a cardinal and very politically active.\n\nLet me write the scene, introducing the young king and his court, and stop when dialogue is directed at Juan.\n\n\nThe protocol discussions consume most of the evening.\n\n\nThe Polish master of ceremonies—a precise, elderly nobleman named Pan Stanisław—walks you through every detail with the patience of a man who has spent his life ensuring that kings do not accidentally insult each other. The order of entry. The proper depth of acknowledgment (a bow, not a genuflection—you are a fellow sovereign, not a subject). The titles to be used (all of them, in the correct order, which takes some negotiation). The topics suitable for a first audience (general friendship, mutual respect, shared faith) versus those requiring private discussion later (specific alliances, military commitments, anything touching on money).\n\n\n\"His Majesty is young,\" Pan Stanisław says delicately, \"but he is not a child. He has ruled Poland for five years. He attends council meetings. He understands statecraft.\" A pause. \"However, certain of his advisors are... protective. They will be present. They will be watching. The first audience is as much for their benefit as for His Majesty's.\"\n\n\nYour own aides take careful notes. By midnight, you feel reasonably confident that you will not accidentally start a war through improper genuflection.\n\n\n\nWAWEL CASTLE — THE FOLLOWING MORNING\n\n\nThe audience chamber of Wawel Castle is a statement in stone and timber.\n\n\nThe vaulted ceiling soars overhead, painted with stars on a deep blue field. Tapestries line the walls—hunting scenes, biblical narratives, the White Eagle of Poland repeated in silver thread. Windows of colored glass cast patterns across the floor. It is not as large as the great halls of Toledo or Naples, but it has a weight to it, a sense of centuries watching.\n\n\nThe Polish court has assembled in force.\n\n\nYou recognize the types immediately—the same types that populate every court in Christendom. The military men, scarred and watchful. The administrators, clutching documents. The churchmen in their vestments. The young nobles jockeying for position near the throne. The old nobles who no longer need to jockey, secure in power that predates the current dynasty.\n\n\nOne figure dominates the ecclesiastical contingent: a man in bishop's purple, tall and lean, with a face like a hawk and eyes that miss nothing. This must be Zbigniew Oleśnicki, Bishop of Kraków, Cardinal, and by all accounts the most powerful man in Poland who does not wear a crown. He was regent during Władysław's minority. Some say he still is, in all but name.\n\n\nThe bishop's gaze finds you as you enter and does not leave.\n\n\n\nAnd then there is the King.\n\n\nWładysław III Jagiellon sits on the Polish throne—a seat of carved oak, ancient and unadorned, that makes the jeweled confections of Italian courts look like children's toys. He is fifteen years old, slender, with the reddish-brown hair of his Lithuanian ancestors and eyes that are older than his face.\n\n\nHe watches you approach with an expression you cannot quite read. Curiosity, certainly. Calculation, perhaps. Something else beneath—the particular loneliness of a boy who has been king since he was ten, who has never known a moment when men did not want something from him.\n\n\nYou halt at the prescribed distance. The titles are exchanged—yours take longer than his, and you see the flicker of something (amusement? irritation?) cross his face as the herald works through Granada, Aragon, Naples, Sicily, Defensor Romaniae. The bow is given and returned.\n\n\nThe formalities complete, a silence falls.\n\n\nWładysław studies you for a long moment. When he speaks, his Latin is excellent—the product of churchmen tutors—but there is a Polish rhythm beneath it, a directness that cuts through courtly circumlocution.\n\n\n\"King Juan of Castile.\" He tests the name. \"You have come very far. Through the Alps. Through Moravia.\" A slight pause. \"We have heard the Moravians were not... hospitable.\"\n\n\nThe court rustles. Someone has been reporting on your journey.\n\n\n\"You have five crowns. You have conquered the Moors. You have sailed to Constantinople and made the Emperor name you defender of his realm.\" The young king leans forward slightly. \"And now you come to Poland. To us.\"\n\n\nHis eyes—grey-green, sharp—hold yours.\n\n\n\"Why?\""

This is not the final persuasion roll for alliance negotiations, but rather a roll to see how the young king responds to Juan's opening statement and whether a positive rapport is established.\n\nLet me think about this from Władysław's perspective:\n\n**What does Władysław want?**\n- Respect as a sovereign (he's 15 but has been king for 5 years)\n- To not be manipulated by foreign powers\n- To prove himself as a capable ruler\n- Protection against Ottoman threats\n- Independence from his powerful advisors (especially Oleśnicki)\n- Perhaps glory and recognition\n\n**What won't he say?**\n- How much control Oleśnicki actually has\n- His own insecurities about being a boy-king\n- How desperate Poland's position might be\n- His personal feelings about being surrounded by men who see him as a pawn\n\n**What has he seen/heard?**\n- Reports of Juan's difficult Moravian passage\n- Stories of Juan's conquests (Granada, Constantinople expedition)\n- Juan is 34, accomplished, confident - everything Władysław aspires to be\n- Juan came personally rather than sending an envoy - this is significant\n- Juan mentioned being crowned young himself - this could resonate OR feel patronizing\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- Juan came personally (shows respect, commitment)\n- Juan mentioned being crowned young - potential connection\n- Juan speaks of fighting together, not asking Poland to serve Castile\n- Juan explicitly wants to know Władysław as a person, not just a political piece\n- The Ottoman threat is real and Poland needs allies\n- Juan's reputation precedes him - five crowns, Defensor Romaniae\n- Juan was direct and martial (\"to fight together\") - Poles respect directness\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- Władysław may feel Juan is being patronizing (the \"crowned young\" comment)\n- The court (especially Oleśnicki) is watching and will influence how Władysław responds\n\n\n- Juan's exhausted arrival undermines the impression of strength\n- The young king might resent receiving counsel on trust from someone so much his senior\n- Poland guards its own interests and may bristle at appearing subordinate\n- Władysław could use this moment to demonstrate he won't be easily swayed by charm or reputation\n\nThis roll determines whether the opening creates genuine warmth or maintains careful distance—not the alliance itself, but whether Władysław engages with authentic interest or polite reserve.\n\n\nPersuasion Analysis: Opening Impression with Władysław III\n\n\n\nThe Context:\nThis is not a specific request yet—Juan is establishing rapport, explaining his presence, and attempting to connect personally with the young king. The roll determines how Władysław receives this opening and what tone the subsequent conversation takes.\n\n\nJuan's Approach:\n\n\nDirect and martial (\"To fight together!\")—Poles respect directness\n\nEmphasized personal presence over sending an envoy—shows respect\n\nSpoke of mutual trust, soldiers standing together—martial framing\n\nReferenced his own young coronation—attempt at personal connection\n\nExpressed curiosity about Władysław as a person, not just a political piece\n\n\nWhat Władysław Wants:\n\n\nRespect as a sovereign, not a boy to be managed\n\nTo prove himself capable without his advisors' interference\n\nAllies who treat Poland as an equal, not a tool\n\nGlory, perhaps—he is fifteen and has heard tales of crusade\n\n\nWhat He Won't Say:\n\n\nHow much Bishop Oleśnicki actually controls\n\nHis own insecurities about being a boy surrounded by old men with agendas\n\nWhether he resents or welcomes Juan's \"crowned young\" comparison\n\n\nWhat He Has Seen:\n\n\nReports of Juan's battered passage through Moravia\n\nThe famous King of Five Crowns, in the flesh, looking tired but dignified\n\nA man who crossed a continent to speak with him personally\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nPersonal visit shows genuine commitment and respect\n\nMartial framing appeals to a young king eager to prove himself\n\n\"Crowned young\" reference could create genuine connection\n\nOttoman threat is real; Poland needs allies\n\nJuan's reputation is formidable—Władysław may be genuinely impressed\n\nDirectness is valued in Polish culture\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nWładysław may perceive condescension in the \"crowned young\" comparison\n\nBishop Oleśnicki is watching; the king may perform caution for his advisors\n\nJuan arrived depleted, not triumphant—first visual impression was mixed\n\nPolish court factions may have already poisoned the well\n\nFifteen-year-olds can be unpredictable—pride, suspicion, defensiveness\n\n\n\nd100 Table: Opening Impression\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nCold Reception. Something in Juan's words strikes wrong—the \"crowned young\" comment lands as patronizing, or Władysław feels he must perform strength before his court. The king's response is polite but distant. Oleśnicki looks satisfied. The conversation will be uphill from here.\n11-25\nGuarded Interest. Władysław is intrigued but cautious. He responds formally, asks probing questions, keeps his own thoughts hidden. The court watches a king who will not be easily charmed. Trust must be earned through substance, not words.\n26-40\nCorrect but Reserved. The king acknowledges Juan's points without committing to warmth. He is polite, engaged, but clearly weighing everything. The advisors' presence weighs on him. A foundation for further conversation, but no breakthrough.\n41-60\nGenuine Engagement. Something resonates—the personal visit, the martial framing, perhaps the shared experience of young kingship. Władysław's formal mask slips slightly; genuine curiosity emerges. He asks real questions. The court notices their king leaning forward.\n61-75\nWarm Reception. Władysław responds to Juan's directness with his own. The \"crowned young\" comment lands well—a spark of recognition, of shared burden. The conversation shifts from formal audience to something approaching real dialogue. Oleśnicki frowns slightly.\n76-90\nStrong Connection. The young king's eyes light up. Here is someone who crossed mountains to meet him, who speaks of standing together rather than demanding service, who remembers what it was to be young and crowned. Władysław's responses become animated. The court sees something they have not seen before.\n91-100\nInstant Rapport. Władysław III recognizes something in Juan—perhaps what he hopes to become. The formal audience transforms; the king waves away protocol, asks to speak privately, shows the hunger of a young man surrounded by cautious old advisors finally meeting someone who acts. The alliance negotiations begin with the hardest work already done.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

A foundation for further conversation, but no breakthrough.\n\nI need to write Władysław's response that reflects this outcome - polite, engaged, but reserved and careful. He's a 15-year-old king surrounded by powerful advisors, particularly Bishop Oleśnicki. He's intrigued by Juan but won't show enthusiasm, especially not in front of his court.\n\nI should show:\n- Władysław acknowledging Juan's points\n- Some interest in the \"crowned young\" comment but not warming to it openly\n- The weight of his advisors watching\n- A foundation for conversation but no breakthrough\n- The political reality of his position\n\nThen stop and wait for Juan's response.\n\n\nRoll: 27 — Correct but Reserved\n\n\n\nWładysław listens. His face betrays little—a skill learned young, you suspect, in a court where showing too much could be fatal.\n\n\nWhen you finish, the silence stretches for a moment.

Truly.\" His tone is measured, correct—the words of a boy who has been coached in diplomacy since he could speak. \"It is not every day that a sovereign of your... reputation... crosses the mountains to visit our court. We acknowledge the effort. We acknowledge the respect it implies.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, and for a moment something flickers behind those grey-green eyes—curiosity, perhaps, or the desire to say more than he will allow himself.\n\n\n\"You speak of trust. Of soldiers standing together. Of knowing one another.\" Władysław's gaze shifts briefly to Oleśnicki, then back to you. The movement is almost imperceptible, but you catch it. \"These are fine words. Poland has heard fine words before. From the Emperor. From the Teutonic Knights. From Hungary.\" A slight hardening of his jaw. \"Words are wind, as the saying goes. What matters is what men do.\"\n\n\nHe straightens on his throne—a conscious gesture, you sense, making himself taller.\n\n\n\"You say you were crowned young. This is true. I have heard the stories. You inherited a kingdom at war with itself and united it. You conquered Granada while men twice your age counseled caution. You sailed to Constantinople when wiser heads said it was folly.\" He tilts his head slightly. \"I have been king for five years. I have kept Poland at peace. I have held the realm together while factions—\" another glance at the court, this one more deliberate, \"—pursued their own interests. These are not songs that bards sing. But they are not nothing.\"\n\n\nThe young king folds his hands in his lap.\n\n\n\"You wish to fight the Ottomans. So do many men. The question is not whether we share an enemy—we do. The question is what, precisely, you propose. What Poland would give. What Poland would gain. What happens if the crusade fails, as crusades have failed before.\"\n\n\nHis voice remains steady, but there is something beneath it now—not hostility, but wariness. The caution of someone who has learned that every offer comes with a price.\n\n\n\"You have come far to speak with us, King Juan. So speak. Tell us what you envision. Tell us what you ask of Poland.\" A pause. \"And tell us what you offer in return that is more than words.\"\n\n\nBehind him, Bishop Oleśnicki permits himself a small, approving nod."

Let me think about how Władysław and his court would react to this.\n\nWhat Władysław is thinking:\n- This is a grand vision, but vague on specifics\n- \"Destroy the Ottomans\" is easier said than done\n- Hungary is complicated - Albert II of Habsburg is King of Hungary right now (though he'll die in October 1439, which is very soon in-game time)\n- Poland has interests in Hungary but it's not Polish territory\n- The young king might be excited by the prospect of glory, but his advisors will be cautious\n- Oleśnicki in particular is a shrewd political operator\n\nWhat the court is thinking:\n- This Castilian king speaks of \"restoring Hungarian lands\" - but Hungary has a king (Albert II)\n- What exactly is Poland's role here? Infantry fodder for Castilian glory?\n- Where does the money come from?\n- What does Poland actually GET from this?\n\nHistorical context:\n- In real history, Władysław III will actually become King of Hungary in 1440 (after Albert II dies in October 1439)\n- He will lead a crusade against the Ottomans in 1444 (the Crusade of Varna)\n- That crusade will end in disaster - Władysław will die at the Battle of Varna in 1444\n- So historically, Władysław IS receptive to crusading ideas\n- But Oleśnicki and other advisors were more cautious\n\nThe proposal Juan is making:\n- Unite armies, strike from Hungary/Croatia\n- Aim to destroy Ottomans and restore Hungarian + Byzantine lands\n- Very grand, very vague\n- Doesn't address: Who commands? Who pays? What does Poland specifically gain? What about the current King of Hungary (Albert II)?\n\nThis is still part of the ongoing conversation, not yet a definitive persuasion roll. The young king is intrigued by glory but his advisors will have concerns. The roll should determine how the conversation develops from here.\n\n\nNow I need to create a d100 table for how the court receives this proposal. The reactions will vary based on who's speaking - some will see opportunity, others will see risk. Oleśnicki will likely probe for weaknesses in the plan, while younger courtiers might be swayed by the romantic notion of crusade. The table should capture the range of responses from enthusiasm to skepticism, with outcomes that shape whether Juan can build momentum or faces immediate resistance.\n\n\nPersuasion Analysis: The Grand Proposal\n\n\n\nWhat Juan Has Proposed:\n\n\nJoint Castilian-Polish crusade against the Ottomans\n\nAttack through Hungary or Croatia\n\nCombine forces to match Ottoman numbers\n\nGoal: \"Destroy the Ottomans\" and restore Hungarian and Byzantine lands\n\n\nWhat the Court is Thinking:\n\n\nWładysław: Glory. A chance to prove himself. The songs that bards would sing. But also—his advisors are watching. He cannot appear a reckless boy seduced by a foreign king's grand words.\n\n\nBishop Oleśnicki: This is dangerously vague. \"Destroy the Ottomans\" is not a plan. Where is the money? Who commands? What happens to Poland if this fails? And yet... a successful crusade would cement his legacy as the man who guided Poland to greatness.\n\n\nThe Military Men: Hungary and Croatia are not Polish lands. Albert of Habsburg holds Hungary. Are we to fight through Habsburg territory? With Habsburg permission? Against it?\n\n\nEveryone: He speaks of restoring Hungarian lands. Hungary has a king. What is he actually proposing?\n\n\nThe Unspoken Problem:\nAlbert II of Habsburg is King of Hungary right now. Juan speaks of restoring Hungarian lands as if they are simply waiting to be liberated—but Hungary is a sovereign kingdom with its own ruler. Is Juan proposing to coordinate with Albert? Replace him? Ignore him entirely?\n\n\nThe Polish court will notice this gap.\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nThe vision is genuinely appealing—crusade, glory, driving back the infidel\n\nWładysław is young and hungry for greatness\n\nPoland does have interests in the region\n\nJuan's military reputation lends credibility\n\nA combined force could theoretically challenge Ottoman numbers\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nExtremely vague on specifics—\"details later\" is not reassuring\n\nNo mention of who pays, who commands, who supplies\n\nThe Hungary problem—Albert II exists and isn't mentioned\n\n\"Destroy the Ottomans\" is not a strategic objective, it's a fantasy\n\nPoland would bear enormous risk for... what exactly?\n\nOleśnicki will ask hard questions Juan hasn't answered\n\n\n\nd100 Table: Reception of the Grand Proposal\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nSkeptical Dismissal. Oleśnicki intervenes directly, asking pointed questions that expose the proposal's vagueness. Władysław, embarrassed to have seemed interested, retreats behind formality. The audience shifts from conversation to interrogation.\n11-25\nHard Questions. The court's concerns surface immediately. What of King Albert? Who commands? Who pays? Władysław watches as his advisors press Juan, gauging his responses. The grand vision meets cold reality.\n26-40\nCautious Interest. Władysław is intrigued but his advisors' skepticism is visible. The king asks careful questions—probing rather than challenging. The proposal is not rejected, but neither is it embraced. Much work remains.\n41-55\nEngaged Debate. The proposal sparks genuine discussion. Władysław asks about specifics; some advisors lean forward with interest while others frown. The conversation becomes a negotiation rather than a pitch. Opportunities exist, but so do obstacles.\n56-70\nGenuine Interest. The young king's eyes show the hunger for glory that lives in every fifteen-year-old. He asks eager questions—not skeptical, but curious. Oleśnicki looks concerned, which tells you something. The door is opening.\n71-85\nEnthusiastic Reception. Władysław responds to the vision with visible excitement. He speaks of Polish arms, of his ancestors who fought pagans, of destiny. His advisors exchange worried glances—their careful king is being swept up. A strong foundation for alliance.\n86-95\nRoyal Endorsement. The young king all but commits on the spot. He speaks of honor, of Christendom, of standing together against the infidel. Oleśnicki attempts to slow things down but Władysław, for once, overrides caution. Details will follow—but the spirit is willing.\n96-100\nA King Transformed. Something in Juan's words ignites a fire in Władysław. This is the moment he has been waiting for—a chance to be more than a boy managed by old men. He rises from his throne, speaks of destiny, and proposes they withdraw to discuss strategy immediately. Poland is ready to crusade.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

Let me think about this:\n\nIn our alternate timeline, we're in 1439. Let me think about what happened historically and what might have happened in this campaign:\n\nHistorically:\n- Albert II of Habsburg became King of Hungary and Bohemia in 1437 (after Sigismund died)\n- Albert II died in October 1439\n- His son Ladislaus the Posthumous was born after Albert's death (in February 1440)\n- Władysław III of Poland was then elected King of Hungary in 1440, becoming Władysław I of Hungary\n\nBut the user is saying that in THIS campaign timeline, Władysław is ALREADY King of Hungary because \"the challenger died after being born\" - this suggests that in the campaign timeline:\n- Albert II has already died (before our current date of September 1439)\n- Ladislaus Posthumous either died shortly after birth or some other succession scenario played out\n- Władysław III has already been elected/crowned King of Hungary\n\nThis is a crucial detail I missed! If Władysław III is already King of Hungary AND Poland, then:\n1. Juan's proposal makes MUCH more sense - they'd be fighting to defend/reclaim Władysław's OWN Hungarian territories\n2. The \"Hungary problem\" I identified doesn't exist\n3. Władysław has even MORE reason to be interested in fighting the Ottomans\n\nI should acknowledge this correction and adjust the scene accordingly. Let me search the project files or ask for clarification about the exact timeline in this campaign.\n\nActually, the user is telling me this is the case. I should accept this correction and revise the scene. The user says \"the challenger died after being born\" - this must mean Ladislaus Posthumous died as an infant in this timeline, clearing the way for Władysław to take the Hungarian crown.\n\nThis changes everything about the conversation - Władysław III is now King of Poland, Lithuania, AND Hungary. \n\nSo Władysław has personal territories at stake in any conflict with the Ottomans—his Hungarian crown gives him direct motivation to defend against Ottoman expansion rather than viewing it as someone else's problem.\n\n\nYou're right—let me verify the campaign timeline for Hungary's succession.\n\n\nTool: Looking for relevant chats in this project...\n\n\nThought process: Acknowledged correction and recalibrated political dynamics accordingly.\n\nThe user is correct. In Chapter 2.53, we rolled a 94 for the Hungarian succession, which resulted in:\n\n**Władysław Triumphant** — Elisabeth's son (Ladislaus Posthumous) died in infancy. Elisabeth accepted a settlement and retired to Austria. The Hungarian magnates united behind Władysław. He is now King of Poland AND Hungary, and has been actively seeking allies including the Defensor Romaniae (Juan).\n\nSo Władysław III is already King of:\n- Poland\n- Lithuania (personal union with Poland)\n- Hungary (as of the roll)\n\nThis completely changes the dynamic of the conversation! Juan's proposal to \"restore Hungarian lands\" is not vague at all - he's proposing to help Władysław reclaim his OWN territories from the Ottomans. The \"Hungary problem\" I identified doesn't exist.\n\nI need to acknowledge this correction and adjust the scene. The proposal makes much more sense now, and Władysław would have a very direct personal stake in fighting the Ottomans.\n\n\nYou're absolutely right—I apologize for the confusion. In Chapter 2.53, you rolled a 94 on the Hungarian succession table, resulting in \"Władysław Triumphant\":\n\n\nElisabeth's son Ladislaus Posthumous died in infancy\n\nElisabeth accepted a settlement and retired to Austria\n\nWładysław III was crowned King of Hungary with the Holy Crown\n\nHe is now King of Poland, Lithuania, AND Hungary\n\nHe has been actively seeking the Defensor Romaniae\n\n\nThis changes everything. Juan's proposal isn't vague at all—he's offering to help Władysław reclaim his own Hungarian territories from the Ottomans. The young king has a direct, personal stake in this crusade.\n\n\nLet me revise the table accordingly:\n\n\n\nRevised Persuasion Analysis: The Grand Proposal\n\n\nWhat Juan Has Proposed:\n\n\nJoint crusade against the Ottomans\n\nAttack through Hungary/Croatia—Władysław's own lands\n\nCombined forces to match Ottoman numbers\n\nRestore Hungarian and Byzantine territories\n\n\nThe Critical Difference:\nThis is not asking Poland to fight for someone else's lands. This is offering to help Władysław III defend and expand his own kingdom. The Ottomans hold Hungarian territory. Władysław, as King of Hungary, has every reason to want it back.\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nJuan offers military alliance for Władysław's own war\n\nWładysław has been actively seeking the Defensor Romaniae\n\nThe young king is eager to prove himself in battle\n\nOttoman pressure on Hungary is real and immediate\n\nCombined Polish-Lithuanian-Hungarian-Castilian force is genuinely formidable\n\nJuan's reputation precedes him—this is a serious ally\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nStill vague on specifics (who commands, who pays)\n\nOleśnicki may counsel caution regardless\n\nWładysław may want to negotiate from strength, not leap at the first offer\n\nThe court must be managed—eagerness could look like desperation\n\n\n\nd100 Table: Reception of the Grand Proposal (Revised)\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nCalculated Restraint. Władysław wants this alliance badly—but he has learned not to show his hand. He responds with careful enthusiasm, probing for terms. Oleśnicki intervenes to slow the pace. The king is interested, but the negotiation will be formal and demanding.\n11-25\nEager but Cautious. The young king's eyes betray his excitement, but his words remain measured. He has been waiting for this moment—but he will not be seen as desperate. He asks pointed questions about specifics, command structure, timing. A strong foundation, but work remains.\n26-45\nGenuine Enthusiasm. Władysław responds with visible energy. He speaks of Hungarian lands under Ottoman yoke, of his duty to liberate them, of the alliance he has prayed for. His advisors exchange glances—the king is engaged. Negotiations can begin in earnest.\n46-65\nWarm Embrace. The formal mask drops. Władysław speaks of destiny, of two young kings crowned before their time, of God's providence bringing the Defensor Romaniae to his court. He proposes immediate private discussions. Oleśnicki looks concerned but does not object.\n66-80\nRoyal Brotherhood. Władysław rises from his throne—a breach of protocol that silences the court. He speaks of Juan not as a foreign king but as a brother in arms. He has been preparing for this war; now he has the ally to fight it. The alliance is all but sealed in spirit.\n81-95\nA Covenant Declared. The young king, overwhelmed by the moment, declares before his court that God has sent the Defensor Romaniae to Poland's aid. He pledges Hungarian and Polish arms to the crusade. His advisors scramble to moderate his language, but the commitment is made publicly. Details must follow, but the will is absolute.\n96-100\nThe Crusade Proclaimed. Władysław III seizes the moment. Before his assembled court, he proclaims the Holy Crusade against the Ottoman—with Juan II of Castile as his partner and brother-in-arms. The court erupts. Church bells will ring across Kraków before sunset. The alliance Juan crossed a continent to forge has been born in a single audience.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

Władysław responds with visible energy and enthusiasm about the crusade proposal. This is a good outcome - not overwhelming, but genuinely positive. The young king is engaged, speaks of his duty to liberate Hungarian lands, and negotiations can begin in earnest.\n\nI need to write Władysław's response, showing his enthusiasm while keeping it grounded. He's a 15-year-old king who has been actively seeking this alliance (per the roll 94 from Chapter 2.53). He's eager but not reckless. His advisors are watching.\n\nI should NOT write Juan's response - I need to stop after Władysław speaks and let the player respond.\n\n\nRoll: 30 — Genuine Enthusiasm\n\n\n\nSomething shifts in Władysław's bearing.\n\n\nThe careful, coached formality does not disappear—he is too well-trained for that—but beneath it, you see the young man emerge. His shoulders straighten. His chin lifts. When he speaks, there is heat in his voice that was not there before.\n\n\n\"Hungarian lands,\" he says. \"You speak of restoring Hungarian lands.\"\n\n\nHe rises from his throne—not dramatically, but with the restless energy of someone who has been sitting too long. The court stirs; this is not strictly protocol. Oleśnicki's eyes narrow, but he does not intervene.\n\n\n\"Do you know what I inherited when I took the Crown of Saint Stephen?\" Władysław moves to the edge of the dais, closer to you than a formal audience would typically allow. \"A kingdom bleeding from a hundred wounds. Ottoman raiders strike across the Danube almost at will. Fortresses that my predecessors built to guard the frontier—some have fallen, others are held by garrisons who have not been paid in years. The peasants flee north, away from the border. The nobles quarrel over who should bear the cost of defense while the Turks carry off their subjects as slaves.\"\n\n\nHis voice rises, carrying across the silent hall.\n\n\n\"I have been King of Hungary for less than a year. Already I have received delegations from Serbian princes, from Wallachian boyars, from Albanian chiefs—all begging for help against the Ottoman tide. They look to Hungary as their shield. And Hungary—\" He gestures sharply. \"Hungary looks around and sees that it stands nearly alone.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to you, and now you see it clearly: the hunger. The ambition. The desperate hope of a young man who has been handed an impossible task and is searching for any path to victory.\n\n\n\"I have sent envoys to Venice. They offer sympathy and count their ducats. I have sent envoys to the Pope. He offers blessings and promises that never quite become soldiers. I have sent envoys to the German princes. They are too busy fighting each other to notice that Christendom is burning.\"\n\n\nWładysław stops directly before you. For a moment, the formality dissolves entirely—it is simply one young king speaking to another.\n\n\n\"And then you arrive. Juan of Castile. The man who conquered Granada. The man who sailed to Constantinople when everyone said it was madness. The Defensor Romaniae.\" His grey-green eyes search your face. \"You crossed the Alps. You crossed Moravia—and I have heard what that cost you. You came here. Not an envoy. Not a letter. You.\"\n\n\nHe draws a breath, steadying himself. When he speaks again, the formal tone has returned—but it rings hollow now, a concession to the watching court rather than genuine reserve.\n\n\n\"Poland and Hungary will hear your proposal with great interest, King Juan. We believe that a coalition of Christian princes, united in purpose and coordinated in action, represents the only true hope of stemming the Ottoman advance.\" He glances at Oleśnicki, a silent acknowledgment of the bishop's influence. \"The details must be discussed. Command structures. Contributions of men and gold. Lines of supply. The role of other powers—Venice, the Papacy, perhaps Burgundy.\"\n\n\nBut then, quieter, meant more for you than for the court:\n\n\n\"But the will is there. If you have come to find an ally who will fight—not merely talk, not merely pray, but fight—then you have found one.\"\n\n\nHe extends his hand—not in the formal manner of courts, but as a soldier might to a comrade.\n\n\nBehind him, Oleśnicki's expression is unreadable. The court holds its breath."

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed young king's battle inexperience against military capacity assessment.\n\nThe player is asking Władysław direct questions - whether he's fought in battle, and how many men Poland and Hungary can muster. This is a natural continuation of the conversation, not requiring a persuasion roll - Juan is simply gathering information and building rapport.\n\nLet me think about what Władysław would honestly answer:\n\n1. Has Władysław fought in battle?\n- He became King of Poland at age 10 in 1434\n- He's now 15 (born 1424, it's 1439)\n- He became King of Hungary in early 1439 after Albert II's death\n- Historically, his first major battle was Varna in 1444, where he died\n- So realistically, at 15, he probably hasn't led troops in actual battle yet - he's been managing the kingdom, dealing with the succession crisis, etc.\n- This might be a sensitive point for a young king eager to prove himself\n\n2. How many men can Poland and Hungary muster?\n- This is a reasonable question for alliance planning\n- Poland in the 15th century could raise perhaps 20,000-30,000 men for a major campaign\n- Hungary similarly could raise 20,000-30,000\n- Combined, potentially 40,000-60,000 - but this would be an extraordinary effort\n- The crusade of Varna historically had around 20,000-25,000 men total\n- Władysław would give a reasonably honest assessment, perhaps optimistic\n\nLet me have Władysław respond honestly but with some sensitivity about his lack of battle experience - he's young and proud, this is a sore point. He'll deflect slightly but not lie. And he'll give realistic numbers for the military strength.\n\nI should also consider Bishop Oleśnicki might interject on the military numbers question - that's a matter for careful discussion, not blurted out in open court.\n\n\nWładysław grips your hand firmly—the grip of a young man eager to prove his strength—and a genuine smile breaks across his face. For a moment, the weight of kingship lifts from his shoulders.\n\n\nThen your questions land, and you see something flicker in his expression. The first question strikes a nerve.\n\n\n\"Fought in battle?\" He releases your hand, and a faint color rises to his cheeks. \"I have trained since I could hold a sword. I have ridden with Polish cavalry on exercises. I have studied the campaigns of my ancestors—Jagiełło at Grunwald, where we broke the Teutonic Knights.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, and his jaw tightens with the honesty that follows.\n\n\n\"But no. I have not yet faced an enemy in the field. I was ten when I became King of Poland. My regents did not permit me to ride to war, and since I came of age...\" He glances toward Oleśnicki. \"There has been the matter of securing Hungary. Diplomacy. Politics. The things that must come before swords.\"\n\n\nThe admission costs him—you can see it. A fifteen-year-old king, hungry for glory, confessing to a man who conquered Granada that he has never bloodied his blade.\n\n\nBut he recovers quickly, lifting his chin.\n\n\n\"That will change. Soon.\"\n\n\n\nThe second question draws a sharp look from Bishop Oleśnicki, who steps forward before Władysław can answer.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty of Castile,\" the bishop says smoothly, his Latin carrying the particular precision of a man who has spent decades in Church politics, \"questions of military strength are perhaps better suited to private council than open court. Numbers spoken publicly have a way of reaching... interested ears.\"\n\n\nWładysław frowns slightly at the interruption but does not contradict his advisor.\n\n\nOleśnicki continues, his hawk's eyes fixed on you. \"However, since the question speaks to the seriousness of any proposed alliance, I can offer this much: Poland and Hungary together, fully mobilized, can field a host that would rival any power in Christendom save perhaps the Ottomans themselves.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, choosing his next words carefully.\n\n\n\"The pospolite ruszenie—the general levy of Polish nobility—can raise twenty thousand mounted knights and men-at-arms when summoned. Hungary's banderia system, if the magnates answer the call in full, adds perhaps twenty-five thousand more. With Lithuanian auxiliaries, Wallachian and Serbian allies, mercenary companies...\"\n\n\nThe bishop spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"Fifty thousand men. Perhaps more, if God wills it and the treasury permits. But such numbers exist only on parchment until they are fed, paid, and led.\" His gaze sharpens. \"What forces does Castile propose to contribute to this coalition, King Juan? And who, in your vision, would command such a host?\"\n\n\nThe court watches. Władysław watches. The young king's enthusiasm has been tempered by his advisor's caution—but not extinguished. He waits to hear your answer."

      "say": "Thought process: Evaluated concrete military proposal and court reactions for response table.\n\nThe player is continuing the conversation with Władysław and Oleśnicki. Juan has now made a concrete offer:\n\n1. 30,000 trained and armored men he can bring to the fight\n2. A fleet that can match the Ottomans ship for ship\n3. A combined land-sea strategy - fleet disrupts Ottoman logistics while army strikes on land\n\nThis is a significant, concrete proposal. Let me think about how the court would receive this.\n\n**What Juan Has Now Offered:**\n- 30,000 trained, armored soldiers (not raw levies - professional troops)\n- Naval supremacy or parity against the Ottomans\n- A coordinated land-sea strategy\n\n**What the Court is Thinking:**\n\n*Władysław:* This is real. This is not words. 30,000 men plus Polish-Hungarian forces means 80,000+ soldiers. A fleet to control the seas. This could actually work. His enthusiasm is building.\n\n*Oleśnicki:* These are serious numbers. Juan is not just talking - he's offering a concrete commitment. The naval dimension is something Poland/Hungary cannot provide. This addresses a real weakness. But... still questions remain. Who commands? When? What are the terms?\n\n*Military Men:* 30,000 Castilian veterans - men who conquered Granada, who have fought in Naples. These are not peasant levies. This is a professional force. And a fleet... the Ottomans have never faced a Christian coalition with naval superiority.\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- Concrete numbers, not vague promises\n- 30,000 is a substantial commitment - roughly matching what Poland alone can provide\n- The naval dimension is crucial and something only Castile can offer\n- Juan acknowledges logistical realities (can't bring everyone, transportation limits)\n- The strategic vision is sound - combined land-sea pressure\n- Juan speaks like a soldier who understands war, not a diplomat making promises\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- Still no answer on who commands\n\n\n- Timeline remains vague - \"proper preparation\" could mean months or years\n- The cost of transporting 30,000 men across the Mediterranean and into Hungary is staggering, and it's unclear who bears that expense\n- Treasury concerns haven't been addressed at all\n- Oleśnicki likely wants specifics before letting optimism take hold\n\nThe naval advantage Juan brings is genuinely compelling—it's the one dimension where Castile has capabilities Poland and Hungary simply lack. But the practical questions of logistics, timing, and command structure still loom large.\n\n\nPersuasion Analysis: The Concrete Offer\n\n\n\nWhat Juan Has Now Offered:\n\n\n30,000 trained and armored soldiers—not raw levies, but professionals\n\nA fleet capable of matching the Ottomans ship for ship\n\nA coordinated two-front strategy: naval pressure + land campaign simultaneously\n\nHonest acknowledgment of logistical realities (distance, transport limits)\n\n\nWhat the Court is Hearing:\n\n\nWładysław: 30,000 Castilian veterans plus 50,000 Polish-Hungarian forces equals 80,000 men. A fleet to threaten Ottoman supply lines. This is not fantasy—this is a war plan. His pulse is quickening.\n\n\nOleśnicki: This man speaks like a soldier, not a diplomat. He knows his limits—he didn't promise 100,000 men he cannot deliver. The naval dimension is crucial; Poland and Hungary are land powers. We cannot threaten Constantinople from the sea. He can. But... command? Timeline? Treasury?\n\n\nThe Military Men: 30,000 men who conquered Granada. Who fought at Aversa. Veterans in good armor, not peasants with pitchforks. And ships—real warships that have faced the Marinids. This changes everything.\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nConcrete numbers demonstrate seriousness\n\nAcknowledging limitations builds credibility\n\nThe naval element addresses a critical gap Poland/Hungary cannot fill\n\nTwo-front pressure is sound strategy the military men will recognize\n\nJuan speaks as a commander who understands logistics\n\n80,000+ combined force genuinely threatens Ottoman dominance\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nCommand structure still unaddressed\n\n\"Given proper preparation\"—how long? A year? Five years?\n\nWho pays for transport, supply, mercenaries?\n\nOleśnicki will want ink on parchment, not spoken promises\n\nEven enthusiasm must eventually yield to negotiation\n\n\n\nd100 Table: Response to the Concrete Offer\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nCautious Acknowledgment. Oleśnicki reasserts control, thanking Juan for his \"generous outline\" while steering toward private negotiations. Władysław's enthusiasm is visibly dampened. The offer is taken seriously, but the bishop will not allow commitments in open court. Everything slows down.\n11-25\nRespectful Probing. The court is impressed, but Oleśnicki presses for specifics: timeline, command, costs. Władysław listens intently as the conversation shifts from inspiration to interrogation. The offer stands, but it must survive scrutiny before the king commits further.\n26-40\nGrowing Conviction. Władysław nods along as you speak, and when you finish, he turns to his military advisors rather than to Oleśnicki. Murmured consultations. The professionals are taking this seriously. The bishop looks less pleased, but the momentum is building despite his caution.\n41-55\nStrategic Engagement. A Polish hetman—one of the scarred military men—speaks up, asking detailed questions about fleet composition, transport capacity, the timeline for Castilian mobilization. The conversation becomes a war council rather than an audience. Władysław watches, learning, his enthusiasm tempered by growing understanding of what war actually requires.\n56-70\nEnthusiastic Alliance. Władysław overrides Oleśnicki's attempt to table the discussion. \"This is what we have been waiting for,\" he declares. He proposes immediate private councils to work out details—command, logistics, timing. The court sees a king taking charge. Oleśnicki yields gracefully, but his eyes promise hard negotiation ahead.\n71-85\nMartial Brotherhood. The young king's eyes shine. He speaks of Polish lancers riding beside Castilian knights, of Ottoman galleys burning on the Aegean, of Constantinople's bells ringing for Christian victory. He grasps your arm—the gesture of a comrade, not a distant sovereign. The alliance has moved beyond negotiation into shared purpose. Details will follow, but the spirit is forged.\n86-95\nA King Transformed. Władysław turns to his court and speaks not as a boy seeking approval but as a monarch declaring intent. Poland and Hungary will join Castile in holy war. Let Venice and Genoa see that others will fight while they count coins. Let the Pope know that the crusade he preaches has found champions willing to die for it. The court erupts in acclamation. Oleśnicki bows to the inevitable.\n96-100\nThe Oath of Kraków. In the heat of the moment, Władysław proposes something extraordinary: a formal oath, sworn before God and the assembled court, binding Poland-Hungary and Castile to mutual crusade against the Ottoman. Not a treaty to be negotiated—a sacred covenant between Christian kings. The bishop cannot object without seeming faithless. History pivots on a young king's courage.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

The court will erupt in acclamation, and Oleśnicki will have to bow to the inevitable.\n\nThis is a powerful moment - I need to write it with the weight it deserves. The young king is stepping into his own, inspired by Juan's concrete offer and presence. This is the moment Władysław becomes something more than a boy-king.\n\nI should:\n1.

End at a natural stopping point for Juan to respond or for the scene to move forward\n5.

You can see the numbers working behind Władysław's eyes—thirty thousand from Castile, fifty thousand from Poland and Hungary, a fleet to match the Ottomans at sea. Eighty thousand men. More than Christendom has fielded against the Turks in living memory.\n\n\nWhen you finish, Władysław does not look to Oleśnicki.\n\n\nHe looks to his court—the nobles, the clergy, the soldiers, the functionaries who have watched him grow from a boy-king into... whatever he is becoming in this moment. He draws a breath, and when he speaks, his voice carries to the farthest corners of the vaulted chamber.\n\n\n\"For five years, I have listened.\"\n\n\nThe words fall like stones into still water.\n\n\n\"I have listened to counselors who urged patience. To diplomats who promised that help was coming—from the Emperor, from Venice, from Rome. To wise men who told me that Poland was not ready, that Hungary was not secure, that the time was not right.\" He pauses. \"I have been a good student. I have waited. I have prepared. I have watched the Ottoman tide rise while Christendom debated and dithered and counted its gold.\"\n\n\nHe steps down from the dais—fully, completely, standing now on the same level as you, as his court. The gesture is unprecedented. The symbolism is unmistakable.\n\n\n\"No more.\"\n\n\nWładysław turns to face his assembled nobles, his voice rising.\n\n\n\"The King of Castile has crossed mountains and hostile lands to stand before us. He has not sent an envoy with pretty words. He has not offered prayers and promises. He has come himself, with a fleet that can challenge Ottoman supremacy at sea and thirty thousand veterans who conquered Granada and broke the armies of Naples.\"\n\n\nHe gestures toward you without looking.\n\n\n\"This man took Constantinople's walls under his protection when every other prince in Christendom wrote the city off as lost. He did not ask permission. He did not wait for a coalition. He acted. And now he stands in our hall, offering to join his strength to ours.\"\n\n\nThe young king's eyes blaze.\n\n\n\"What answer shall Poland give? What answer shall Hungary give? Shall we tell him that we are not ready? That we need more time? That perhaps next year, or the year after, we might consider the matter further?\"\n\n\nA rumble moves through the court—the sound of men stirring, of something shifting.\n\n\n\"I say NO.\"\n\n\nWładysław's voice cracks across the hall like a whip.\n\n\n\"I say that if we wait for the perfect moment, we will wait until Ottoman hooves trample the streets of Kraków. I say that eighty thousand Christian soldiers, striking by land and sea, is an army that can break the Turkish advance. I say that God has sent us an ally, and we will not turn him away!\"\n\n\nHe spins back to face you, and there are tears in his eyes—the tears of a young man who has carried an impossible burden and finally sees a way forward.\n\n\n\"Poland stands with Castile.\"\n\n\nHe raises his voice for the court.\n\n\n\"Hungary stands with Castile!\"\n\n\nThe hall erupts.\n\n\nNobles pound the floor with their boots. Knights clash gauntlets against breastplates. Someone begins shouting \"Deus Vult!\" and the cry spreads like wildfire. The ancient war-cry of the crusades, dormant for generations, roars back to life in the heart of Wawel Castle.\n\n\nThrough it all, Bishop Oleśnicki stands motionless. His face is unreadable—but after a long moment, he bows. Not to you. To his king. A deep bow, the acknowledgment of a man who has guided a boy for years and now sees that the boy has become something else.\n\n\nWhen the noise subsides enough for speech, Władysław grasps your arm—the grip of a brother, not a fellow sovereign.\n\n\n\"We have much to discuss, King Juan. Command. Timing. The path of march. The contributions of other powers.\" His smile is fierce, joyful, young. \"But those are details. The will is decided. Poland and Hungary will crusade.\"\n\n\nHe looks out over his cheering court.\n\n\n\"Let Venice hear of this and tremble at their own cowardice. Let the Pope know that while he preaches, we act. Let Sultan Murad learn that the Christian kings have remembered how to fight.\"\n\n\nHis hand tightens on your arm.\n\n\n\"And let the bells of Constantinople ring again for Christ.\""

Oleśnicki has accepted the inevitable but will still want to ensure proper process. The military men will want war councils. The court will want celebration.\n\nWhat happens next:\n- The immediate audience concludes with triumph\n- Władysław will want to continue discussions - but protocol and practical needs intervene\n- There should be a feast/celebration\n- Then private councils for actual planning\n- The chapter could end here or continue into the negotiations\n\nLet me write the aftermath of this triumphant moment.\n\n\nThe roar that answers you shakes dust from the rafters.\n\n\n\"CASTILLE STANDS WITH POLAND!\"\n\n\nThe cry is taken up, mangled by Polish and Hungarian tongues unfamiliar with the Castilian name, but the meaning is unmistakable.

He has come to plan a war. We will not waste his time—or ours.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to you, and the fierce joy softens into something more personal.\n\n\n\"But tonight, we celebrate. You have given Poland something it has not had in years, King Juan.\" A pause. \"Hope.\"\n\n\n\nThe feast that follows is everything a Polish royal celebration should be.\n\n\nThe great hall of Wawel Castle transforms. Trestle tables appear laden with roasted boar, venison, pike from the Vistula, mountains of bread, rivers of mead and Hungarian wine. Musicians play—wild, driving melodies unlike the refined compositions of Italian courts. Polish nobles toast you in languages you don't understand, then embrace you like a brother regardless. Hungarian lords, quieter but no less intense, study you with the eyes of men already calculating how your ships might support their frontier fortresses.\n\n\nYou are seated at Władysław's right hand—the place of highest honor. The young king alternates between playing the gracious host and peppering you with questions: about Granada, about Constantinople, about naval warfare, about how you manage an empire of five crowns. He listens intently to every answer, filing the information away.\n\n\nOleśnicki sits nearby, eating little, drinking less, watching everything. At one point, he catches your eye and raises his cup in a small, private salute. The gesture says: Well played. Now the real work begins.\n\n\n\nThe hour grows late. The torches burn low. Many of the older nobles have retired; the younger ones grow louder as the wine flows.\n\n\nWładysław leans close, his voice dropping beneath the noise of celebration.\n\n\n\"I meant what I said, King Juan. Every word.\" His eyes are clear despite the wine—he has been drinking sparingly, you notice. \"But I am not a fool. I know that Oleśnicki thinks I spoke too boldly, committed too quickly. He will want treaties, guarantees, precise terms written in Latin and sealed with wax.\"\n\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n\n\"He is probably right. That is why I keep him close—he sees the dangers I miss.\" A wry smile. \"But he also misses the opportunities that only boldness can seize. Today was such an opportunity. If I had hesitated, consulted, deliberated... the moment would have passed. You would have returned to Castile wondering if Poland was truly committed.\"\n\n\nHe meets your gaze directly.\n\n\n\"I want you to know that I am committed. Whatever Oleśnicki negotiates, whatever terms we agree to—the will behind them is real. Poland will march. Hungary will march. When you call, we will answer.\"\n\n\nHe raises his cup.\n\n\n\"To the crusade, King Juan. May God grant us victory—or a death worthy of the cause.\""

This is where the real work begins - hammering out the specifics of the crusade alliance.\n\nI should set the scene for a war council/negotiation session. Key participants would be:\n- Władysław III (eager but inexperienced)\n- Bishop Oleśnicki (the real power, cautious, will push for concrete terms)\n- Polish and Hungarian military commanders (hetmans, magnates)\n- Juan and his advisors\n\nThe key issues to discuss:\n1. Command structure - who leads the combined army?\n2. Timeline - when does this happen?\n3. Contributions - exact numbers, who provides what\n4. Lines of march - through what territory?\n5. Objectives - what exactly are we trying to achieve?\n6. Coordination with other powers - Venice, Papacy, etc.\n7. What happens if it fails - contingencies\n8. Naval operations - how do they coordinate with land campaign?\n\nI should present this as a scene where these discussions begin, with NPCs raising realistic concerns and questions. I should NOT resolve everything in one response - this should be a back-and-forth negotiation.\n\nLet me set the scene and have the Polish side open with their concerns/questions, then stop for Juan to respond.\n\n\nWAWEL CASTLE — THE MORNING AFTER\nSeptember 1439\n\n\n\nThe feast's echoes linger in aching heads throughout the castle, but the war council chamber shows no sign of last night's revelry.\n\n\nThe room is austere, functional—a long table of dark oak, maps already spread across its surface, narrow windows admitting the grey light of a Polish autumn morning. This is where the Jagiellons plan their wars.\n\n\nWładysław is already present when you arrive, looking remarkably fresh for a young man who was toasting crusade until the small hours. He wears simple clothes—a soldier's practicality rather than a king's finery. Oleśnicki sits at his right hand, papers stacked before him, a secretary hovering nearby with quill and ink.\n\n\nSeveral other men occupy seats around the table:\n\n\nJan of Koniecpol, the elderly Hetman Wielki Koronny—Grand Hetman of the Crown—Poland's highest military commander. A weathered campaigner in his sixties with a scarred face and the distant gaze of a man who has buried too many soldiers.\n\n\nMiklós Újlaki, Ban of Macsó, representing the Hungarian magnates. Younger than Koniecpol, dark-haired, with the wary alertness of someone who has actually fought the Ottomans on the frontier.\n\n\nJan Tarnowski, a Polish noble of middle years, representing the szlachta—the warrior nobility whose cavalry forms the backbone of Polish military power.\n\n\nAnd others—clerks, translators, minor officials—the machinery of administration that transforms royal will into practical action.\n\n\nWładysław gestures you to the seat at his left. As you settle, Oleśnicki speaks.\n\n\n\"Let us be clear about what was declared yesterday and what remains to be decided.\"\n\n\nHis tone is not hostile—but it is precise, the voice of a man who has spent a lifetime preventing enthusiasm from outrunning wisdom.\n\n\n\"His Majesty has committed Poland and Hungary to crusade alongside Castile. This commitment is genuine and will be honored.\" A slight nod to Władysław. \"However, a commitment to fight is not the same as a plan to win. We must now discuss the particulars.\"\n\n\nHe consults his papers.\n\n\n\"First: timing. When does this crusade march? His Majesty of Castile spoke of 'proper preparation.' What does this mean? Six months? A year? Five years?\"\n\n\nOld Hetman Koniecpol grunts. \"The pospolite ruszenie requires three months' notice to assemble in full. The Hungarian banderia, perhaps the same. If we are to march together, we must know when.\"\n\n\n\"Second: objectives.\" Oleśnicki's eyes fix on you. \"You spoke of 'destroying the Ottomans' and restoring Hungarian and Byzantine lands. These are stirring words. But what, precisely, is the campaign's goal? Do we march on Adrianople? On Constantinople itself? Do we seek to push the Turks from the Balkans entirely, or merely to secure the Hungarian frontier?\"\n\n\nBan Újlaki leans forward. \"The frontier fortresses—Smederevo, Golubac, Nándorfehérvár—these are the keys to Hungary. If we hold them, the Ottomans cannot raid our lands at will. If we lose them, no victory elsewhere matters. Any campaign must address the frontier.\"\n\n\n\"Third: command.\" Oleśnicki's voice carries a delicate edge. \"Eighty thousand men from three kingdoms cannot have three commanders. Someone must hold supreme authority in the field. Who?\"\n\n\nThe question hangs in the air. Władysław shifts slightly in his seat. He is King of Poland and Hungary—but he has never commanded in battle. You have conquered Granada, won Aversa, crossed the Mediterranean. The answer seems obvious—but saying it aloud is another matter.\n\n\n\"Fourth: the fleet.\" Oleśnicki gestures at the map. \"His Majesty of Castile spoke of matching the Ottomans ship for ship. This is a tremendous advantage—Poland and Hungary have no meaningful naval power. But ships in the Mediterranean are far from armies in Hungary. How do we coordinate? What does the fleet do while the army marches? How do we communicate across a thousand miles?\"\n\n\nHe sets down his papers and folds his hands.\n\n\n\"These are not objections, King Juan. They are questions that must be answered before a single soldier marches. We have all seen crusades founder on poor planning. The Nicopolis campaign. The Varna disaster in the histories yet to be written if we are careless.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then adds more quietly:\n\n\n\"His Majesty has staked his reign on this alliance. Poland has staked its future. We must ensure that the sacrifice is not wasted.\"\n\n\nWładysław nods slowly, then turns to you.\n\n\n\"You have waged war successfully across half the world, King Juan. We would hear your thoughts.\""

But I have no specific reason to strike one year or another except that every year that passes is another year of christians suffering under muslim rule.\n\n\nAs for objectives, if we can indeed raise such a large host, we should strike at the heart of the Ottoman power, forcing them into an engagement.

They do not need to coordinate to succeed. The fleet objective is to disrupt the Ottomans as they assemble their army, hinder or stop their supply lines and to destroy their fleet to expand our advantage.

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed persuasion mechanics across cultural sensitivities and command structure tensions.\n\nThis is a significant persuasion moment. Juan is proposing:\n\n1. **Timing**: Spring 1441 at earliest (honoring the truce with one year's notice)\n2. **Objectives**: Strike at Ottoman heart, forcing engagement - defers to Polish/Hungarian input\n3. **Command**: Juan as supreme commander, but with promises of equality and brotherhood\n4. **Fleet coordination**: Independent operations - fleet disrupts, army strikes\n\nLet me analyze this carefully using the persuasion skill framework.\n\n**The Ask:**\n- Accept Spring 1441 timeline\n- Accept Juan as supreme commander of the combined army\n- Accept the strategic framework (independent fleet/army operations)\n\n**Juan's Approach Quality:**\n\n*Argument quality:*\n- The truce point is excellent - it shows honor, which resonates deeply with medieval values\n- \"Spring 1441 at earliest\" gives 18+ months to prepare - reasonable\n- Deferring on objectives shows respect for local knowledge\n- The command proposal is delicate - he claims it but softens with promises of brotherhood\n- Fleet/army independence is strategically sound and avoids coordination nightmares\n\n*Cultural appropriateness:*\n- Honoring a truce even with an infidel demonstrates *honra* - crucial in medieval context\n- Offering himself as commander while emphasizing equality is well-framed\n- \"Battle brothers, not subordinates\" appeals to Polish szlachta pride\n\n*Concerns addressed:*\n- Timing: Yes - concrete date with honorable reasoning\n- Objectives: Partially - deferred to their input\n- Command: Yes - addressed directly with face-saving language\n- Fleet coordination: Yes - explains the independent strategy\n\n**What Each Person Wants:**\n\n*Władysław:* Wants glory, wants to prove himself. Being subordinate to Juan stings, but... he knows he's never commanded. He may actually be relieved someone experienced will lead.\n\n*Oleśnicki:* Wants a plan that won't get Poland destroyed. The timing is good (preparation time). The command question... he knows Władysław is inexperienced. But a foreign king commanding Polish forces is politically sensitive.\n\n\nKoniecpol is a seasoned military man—he'll likely prefer a commander with actual experience over the young prince, though he'll want clarity on his own position. Újlaki cares primarily about protecting Hungary's frontier fortresses, which Juan hasn't explicitly addressed, leaving a potential gap. The szlachta nobility will resist taking orders from a foreigner, regardless of how it's framed.\n\nJuan's proposal has real strengths: honoring the truce signals integrity, the 18-month timeline appears professionally sound rather than reckless, and his military track record gives him credibility that Władysław lacks. Calling them \"battle brothers\" rather than subordinates is shrewd for managing Polish pride. The separate fleet operations also make practical sense.\n\nBut the obstacles are substantial. A foreign commander leading Polish and Hungarian forces breaks precedent and threatens their sovereignty. Újlaki's concerns about frontier defense remain unresolved—he needs assurance this isn't just a glory campaign. The szlachta's notorious pride could still rebel against foreign authority. Oleśnicki, as the real power behind the throne, may view surrendering military control to an outsider as dangerous. And maintaining commitment across 18 months of preparation tests everyone's resolve.\n\nThe command structure itself is the crux. Władysław is untested at 15, Koniecpol is experienced but lacks royal authority—Juan is the only figure with both. That logic is compelling, and crusading history shows that unclear command chains invite disaster. Juan framed his claim humbly and offered face-saving language, which helps. Still, asking Poles to follow a Castilian into battle remains a significant ask, and this tension could unravel the whole alliance if not carefully managed.\n\n\nPersuasion Analysis: The War Council Proposal\n\n\n\nThe Ask:\n\n\nAccept Spring 1441 timeline (honoring Ottoman truce)\n\nAccept Juan as supreme commander of combined forces\n\nAccept strategic framework of independent fleet/army operations\n\nDefer specific objectives to Polish/Hungarian input\n\n\nJuan's Approach Quality:\n\n\nStrengths:\n\n\nHonoring the truce demonstrates honor—a value that transcends religious boundaries in medieval thinking\n\nConcrete timeline allows 18+ months of preparation—professional, realistic\n\nDeferring on objectives shows respect for local expertise\n\n\"Humbly suggest myself\" rather than demanding command\n\n\"Battle brothers, not subordinates\" directly addresses Polish pride\n\nIndependent fleet operations avoids coordination nightmares across a thousand miles\n\nJuan has actually won wars; Władysław has not—the logic is hard to argue\n\n\nPotential Weaknesses:\n\n\nForeign king commanding Polish and Hungarian armies is unprecedented\n\n\"Strike at the heart\" remains vague—Újlaki wants frontier security addressed specifically\n\nSpring 1441 is 18 months away—maintaining commitment is challenging\n\nWładysław might feel diminished, even if privately relieved\n\n\n\nWhat Each Person Wants:\n\n\nWładysław: Glory, respect, to prove himself. Being subordinate stings—but he knows he's untested. May be privately relieved while publicly needing face-saving.\n\n\nOleśnicki: A plan that won't destroy Poland. Preparation time is good. Foreign command is politically sensitive but... the boy-king cannot lead 80,000 men into battle.\n\n\nHetman Koniecpol: A commander who knows what he's doing. Veterans recognize other veterans. Probably relieved the decision won't rest on an untested king.\n\n\nBan Újlaki: Frontier security. He heard \"strike at the heart\" but not \"protect Hungarian fortresses.\" Needs reassurance this isn't a glory campaign that leaves Hungary exposed.\n\n\nTarnowski (szlachta): Polish noble pride. Foreign command rankles. But \"battle brothers\" helps, and Juan's reputation commands respect.\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nHonoring the truce demonstrates honor—universally respected\n\n18 months preparation is professional and realistic\n\nDeferring on objectives shows respect for local knowledge\n\nJuan's military reputation makes command claim credible\n\n\"Battle brothers, not subordinates\" addresses Polish pride directly\n\nIndependent fleet/army operations is strategically sound\n\nClear command structure prevents the disasters that plagued previous crusades\n\nWładysław has never commanded; Juan has won multiple wars—the logic is undeniable\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nForeign king commanding Polish-Hungarian armies is politically sensitive\n\nSzlachta pride may bristle regardless of framing\n\n\"Strike at the heart\" doesn't specifically address Hungarian frontier concerns\n\n18 months is long time to maintain enthusiasm and commitment\n\nWładysław may need more explicit face-saving regarding his role\n\nCeding military authority to foreign power sets concerning precedent\n\n\n\nd100 Table: Reception of the War Council Proposal\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nPride Before Wisdom. The command proposal lands badly. Tarnowski speaks for the szlachta—Polish knights do not take orders from foreign kings, however renowned. Újlaki questions whether Castile understands Hungarian needs. The reasonable proposal drowns in wounded pride. Oleśnicki must work to salvage the alliance from an argument about honor.\n11-20\nFriction on Command. The timeline and strategy are accepted, but the command question provokes sharp debate. Władysław's face betrays discomfort. Koniecpol supports Juan's experience; Tarnowski resists foreign authority. The discussion becomes about compromise—joint command? Advisory role? The alliance holds but the structure remains contested.\n21-35\nCautious Acceptance. Oleśnicki acknowledges the proposal's merits but presses for specifics. What is Władysław's role? How are Polish forces organized under Castilian command? What guarantees exist? The framework is accepted in principle, but details must be negotiated carefully. Progress, but slowly.\n36-50\nProfessional Agreement. The military men—Koniecpol and Újlaki—recognize sound strategy when they hear it. They accept Juan's command with minimal friction, focusing discussion on practical matters: march routes, supply lines, frontier security. The politicians follow the soldiers' lead. A working alliance takes shape.\n51-65\nRespectful Consensus. Juan's handling of the command question wins points. Władysław nods thoughtfully at \"battle brothers\"; Tarnowski's resistance softens. Oleśnicki steers discussion toward implementation rather than objection. The council becomes collaborative—Újlaki raises frontier concerns, expecting solutions rather than dismissal.\n66-80\nEnthusiastic Alignment. Old Koniecpol speaks first: \"This is how wars are won. One commander. Clear objectives. Let the man who conquered Granada lead us.\" His endorsement carries weight. Władysław, freed from the burden of command he secretly dreaded, visibly relaxes. The council begins planning in earnest.\n81-90\nMilitary Brotherhood. Something shifts in the room. These men—Polish hetmans, Hungarian bans, Castilian king—recognize each other as soldiers first, politicians second. Juan's honoring of the truce, his deference on objectives, his honest claim to command—it all rings true. The alliance forged in last night's enthusiasm now acquires professional foundations.\n91-95\nA Council United. Władysław rises to personally endorse Juan's command. \"I have much to learn,\" he says simply. \"I will learn it at King Juan's side—not by pretending to knowledge I do not have.\" The admission, far from diminishing him, elevates him. The szlachta see a king wise enough to know his limits. The campaign structure is accepted by acclamation.\n96-100\nThe Framework of Victory. Everything aligns. The timeline is accepted. The command is accepted. And then Újlaki, the Hungarian frontiersman, makes a suggestion that transforms the campaign: a specific objective that serves everyone's interests, building on Juan's framework. The war council becomes a genuine collaboration, each kingdom contributing expertise. They leave the room not as allies but as brothers-in-arms with a plan to win.\n\n\nRoll when ready."

I need to narrate this moment - the acceptance of Juan's proposals, Władysław's graceful endorsement, and crucially, Újlaki's contribution that elevates the plan.\n\nLet me think about what Újlaki might suggest. He's the Hungarian frontier expert, the Ban of Macsó. He cares about:\n- Frontier security (Smederevo, Golubac, Nándorfehérvár)\n- Practical defense against Ottoman raids\n- Not leaving Hungary exposed while the army chases glory\n\nA brilliant suggestion from him might be:\n- A staged campaign that secures the frontier FIRST, then strikes at the heart\n- Using the secured fortresses as a supply chain for the deeper offensive\n- Coordinating the fleet action with specific fortress relief\n- A specific target that serves both \"strike at the heart\" AND frontier security\n\nThe key Ottoman target that would achieve both would be something like:\n- Adrianople (Edirne) - the Ottoman European capital\n- But that might be too ambitious for a first strike\n\nActually, thinking about the geography and timeline:\n- The Serbian Despotate is a buffer state under Ottoman pressure\n- Smederevo is the Serbian capital, key fortress on the Danube\n- If they can break Ottoman control of Serbia, they secure Hungary's southern frontier AND create a springboard for further operations\n\nÚjlaki might suggest: Rather than an undefined \"strike at the heart,\" they should aim to LIBERATE SERBIA first. This:\n1. Secures the Hungarian frontier (Újlaki's priority)\n2. Creates a Christian buffer state\n3. Draws the Ottoman field army into a defensive battle on terrain of Christian choosing\n4. Opens the road to further offensives\n5. Is achievable, not fantasy\n\nThis would be a genuinely collaborative moment where the local expertise adds to Juan's framework.\n\n\nThe war council should feel like a turning point - where disparate voices converge into unified purpose. Juan provides the strategic vision, Władysław lends royal authority, and Újlaki grounds it all in frontier realities by proposing they liberate Serbia first, using Smederevo as both a defensive anchor for Hungary and a launching point for deeper strikes. They leave with concrete objectives rather than vague ambitions.\n\n\nRoll: 99 — The Framework of Victory\n\n\n\nSilence follows your words.\n\n\nNot the uncomfortable silence of disagreement, nor the charged silence of wounded pride. This is the silence of men thinking—actually thinking—about what you have proposed.\n\n\nOld Hetman Koniecpol breaks it first.\n\n\n\"Eighteen months.\" He rolls the timeline around in his mouth like wine being tested. \"That is enough. That is proper. I have seen too many campaigns rushed to disaster because some prince grew impatient.\" He looks at you with eyes that have watched boys become corpses on a dozen battlefields. \"You honor your truce with the Sultan. Some would call that foolish—strike while he does not expect. But you understand something that young men rarely do.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\n\"Wars are not won by treachery. They are won by preparation. By logistics. By having more food, more arrows, more horseshoes than your enemy expects.\" A grim smile. \"The Ottomans win because they prepare. If we are to beat them, we must prepare better.\"\n\n\nHe turns to the room.\n\n\n\"I support Castilian command.\"\n\n\n\nThe words land like a thunderclap. Tarnowski stiffens—the szlachta representative clearly prepared to object—but Koniecpol continues before he can speak.\n\n\n\"I am too old to care about pride, Pan Tarnowski. I care about winning. I care about Polish boys coming home from this war instead of rotting in Turkish soil.\" He gestures at you. \"This man has won wars. Real wars, not border skirmishes. He took Granada when everyone said it could not be done. He broke a Neapolitan army at Aversa. His fleet controls the western Mediterranean.\"\n\n\nThe old hetman's voice hardens.\n\n\n\"Our king is brave. He is committed. He will make a great war-leader someday. But he is fifteen years old and has never seen a battle. If we put him in command of eighty thousand men against Sultan Murad, we are gambling Poland's future on a boy's first lesson.\"\n\n\nHe looks at Władysław—not with contempt, but with the brutal honesty of a man who has served the Jagiellons for decades.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I say this as one who has bled for your house: learn from King Juan before you lead. Ride at his side. Watch how he commands. And when the time comes—when you have seen what war truly is—then you will be ready to lead Poland's armies yourself.\"\n\n\nThe room holds its breath.\n\n\nWładysław is very still. His jaw is tight. For a moment, you see the boy-king wrestling with pride—the instinct to assert himself, to reject the implication that he is not ready.\n\n\nThen something shifts in his expression.\n\n\nHe rises.\n\n\n\"Hetman Koniecpol speaks wisdom.\"\n\n\nThe words are quiet, but they carry. Tarnowski's prepared objection dies in his throat.\n\n\n\"I have dreamed of leading Poland to glory since I was old enough to hold a sword.\" Władysław's voice is steady. \"But dreams are not the same as knowledge. King Juan has done what I have only imagined. If I am wise enough to recognize that—\" he looks around the room, meeting each man's eyes, \"—then perhaps I am wise enough to learn from it.\"\n\n\nHe turns to you.\n\n\n\"I accept your command, King Juan. Not because Poland is subordinate to Castile—we are not, and never will be—but because this war requires your experience. I will ride at your side. I will learn. And I will hold you to your promise.\" A ghost of a smile. \"Battle brothers. Not subordinates.\"\n\n\nHe extends his hand.\n\n\nYou clasp it.\n\n\nAnd then Ban Újlaki speaks.\n\n\n\n\"My lords. My kings.\"\n\n\nThe Hungarian's voice cuts through the moment—not to interrupt, but to build.\n\n\n\"You have settled command. You have settled timeline. But you have not settled objective.\" He rises, moving to the map spread across the table. \"King Juan speaks of striking at the heart of Ottoman power. This is sound—the Turk must be broken, not merely pushed back. But Hetman Koniecpol speaks of preparation, of logistics, of ensuring our boys come home.\"\n\n\nHis finger stabs down on the map.\n\n\n\"These two goals need not conflict. In fact, they can reinforce each other.\"\n\n\nHe traces a line along the Danube.\n\n\n\"Serbia.\"\n\n\nThe word hangs in the air.\n\n\n\"The Serbian Despotate is the key to everything. Despot Đurađ Branković holds Smederevo here—\" his finger taps the fortress, \"—but he holds it as an Ottoman vassal, because he has no choice. The Sultan's armies can march through Serbia at will. They use Serbian roads, Serbian supplies, Serbian fortresses. As long as Serbia is in Ottoman hands, Hungary's frontier is indefensible.\"\n\n\nHe looks up, his dark eyes intense.\n\n\n\"But if we liberate Serbia—if we break the Ottoman grip on the Despotate—everything changes.\"\n\n\nHis hand sweeps across the map.\n\n\n\"First: we secure Hungary's frontier. Smederevo, Golubac, Nándorfehérvár—these fortresses become ours, not staging points for Ottoman raids. The Hungarian magnates will support a war that protects their lands.\"\n\n\n\"Second: we gain a Christian ally. Despot Đurađ is no friend to the Turks—he serves them because he must. Free him, and Serbia becomes a buffer state, a partner, a source of soldiers who know Ottoman tactics better than anyone.\"\n\n\n\"Third—\" Újlaki's voice rises, \"—we force the Sultan's hand. Murad cannot allow Serbia to fall. If we march on Smederevo, he must respond. He must bring his army to meet us—on ground of our choosing, at a time of our choosing, with his supply lines stretched across hostile territory.\"\n\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\n\"King Juan speaks of striking at the heart. I say: Serbia is the heart. It is the gate through which Ottoman power flows into Europe. Take the gate, and we have won more than a battle—we have changed the shape of the war.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you.\n\n\n\"The fleet can operate independently, as you suggest—raiding Ottoman shipping, disrupting supply lines, threatening the Aegean coast. Every galley Murad must keep in the south is a galley not carrying reinforcements to Serbia. And if the fleet can threaten the Dardanelles—even threaten, not take—the Sultan must divide his attention.\"\n\n\nÚjlaki returns to his seat.\n\n\n\"This is what Hungary offers to the council: local knowledge. We know these lands. We know the fortresses. We know where the Ottoman army must march and where it can be stopped.\" His voice drops. \"Twenty thousand Hungarians will march for a campaign that protects their homes. Offer them a vague crusade to distant lands, and you will get excuses and delays. Offer them the liberation of Serbia—the end of the raids that have plagued them for a generation—and they will fight.\"\n\n\n\nThe room is electric.\n\n\nOleśnicki—silent until now—nods slowly. \"The Ban speaks strategically. A campaign with a clear, achievable objective. A campaign that serves immediate defensive needs while opening the door to further offensives. A campaign that our nobles can understand.\"\n\n\nKoniecpol grunts approval. \"Serbia. Yes. I can work with that. Clear supply lines down the Danube. Known terrain. Fortresses to anchor our flanks.\"\n\n\nTarnowski, his earlier resistance forgotten, leans forward eagerly. \"The Polish cavalry in open country south of the Danube... the Turks have never faced the husaria in full charge. If we can bring them to battle on ground that favors mounted action...\"\n\n\nWładysław's eyes are bright. \"Serbia first. Then—if God wills—Bulgaria. Thrace. And finally...\" He does not say Constantinople. He does not need to.\n\n\nThe young king turns to you.\n\n\n\"King Juan. You asked what objectives we felt we should pursue. You have heard Ban Újlaki's proposal.\" He gestures at the map, at the men around the table, at the alliance taking shape in this cold stone room. \"What say you? Is Serbia the gate we should storm?\""

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed Mediterranean logistics and charted Adriatic port strategy.\n\nThe player is asking about logistics - specifically which port would be best for Castilian reinforcements arriving by sea to link up with the land army campaigning in Serbia.\n\nLet me think about the geography:\n- Serbia is inland, along the Danube\n- The campaign would be in the central Balkans\n- Castilian ships would be coming from the Mediterranean\n\nThe options for ports that could serve as a logistics hub:\n\n1. **Adriatic ports:**\n- Venice - but Venice is an independent power, may not want to be involved\n- Ragusa (Dubrovnik) - independent city-state, traditionally neutral\n- Split/Spalato - in Hungarian territory (Dalmatia belonged to Hungary)\n- Zadar - also Hungarian Dalmatia\n\n2. **Aegean/Eastern Mediterranean:**\n- Thessaloniki - but this is Ottoman-held\n- Constantinople - Juan has influence there but it's far from Serbia\n\n3. **The key insight:**\nHungary actually has Adriatic coastline - the Kingdom of Hungary controlled Dalmatia in this period. So ports like Split (Spalato) or other Dalmatian cities could serve as a landing point.\n\nFrom Dalmatia, reinforcements could march overland through Bosnia/Croatia to reach the Serbian theater.\n\nLet me have the council discuss this - Újlaki as the Hungarian would know this best, and Oleśnicki might have thoughts on logistics.\n\nThe most logical answer would be:\n- **Split (Spalato)** - major Dalmatian port under Hungarian control\n- From Split, overland march through Croatian/Bosnian lands to Serbia\n- This is maybe 200-300 miles overland but through mostly friendly territory\n\nAlternatively:\n- Sail up the Adriatic, then somehow use rivers? The Danube flows into the Black Sea, not the Adriatic, so that doesn't work.\n\nActually, I should think about this more carefully:\n- The Danube flows EAST into the Black Sea\n- Serbia is on the Danube\n\n\n- The Black Sea approach would mean sailing through the Bosphorus/Dardanelles - which are Ottoman controlled, so that's impossible for Castilian ships. The Adriatic route is the only viable option for Mediterranean naval power. Split or other Dalmatian ports make the most sense as landing points, with overland routes through Croatian and Bosnian territories into Serbia. Újlaki would have valuable insight here given his Hungarian background and local knowledge of these regions.\n\n\nÚjlaki nods approvingly—this is the question of a man who thinks in terms of supply lines, not glory.\n\n\n\"A critical question, Your Majesty. And one that reveals the challenge of coordinating land and sea power.\"\n\n\nHe moves back to the map, tracing the coastline.\n\n\n\"The difficulty is this: Serbia is landlocked. The Danube flows east into the Black Sea—\" his finger follows the river, \"—but the Black Sea approach means sailing through here.\" He taps the narrow strait at Constantinople. \"The Dardanelles and the Bosphorus. Ottoman-controlled waters. Your fleet cannot simply sail up to Belgrade.\"\n\n\nHis hand moves west, to the Adriatic coast.\n\n\n\"But Hungary holds Dalmatia.\"\n\n\nHe indicates a stretch of coastline dotted with ports.\n\n\n\"Here. Split—Spalato, the Italians call it. The finest harbor on the eastern Adriatic. It has been Hungarian since the time of King Louis the Great.\" His finger moves north. \"Zadar. Also ours. Smaller, but well-fortified.\"\n\n\nOleśnicki interjects, \"Split is perhaps three hundred miles from the Serbian frontier. Overland, through Croatian lands—which are also under His Majesty's crown—and then through Bosnia.\"\n\n\n\"Bosnia is... complicated,\" Újlaki admits. \"The Bosnian king is nominally Christian but plays all sides—Hungary, the Ottomans, the Pope. However, if we march in force, he will not obstruct us. He fears the Sultan more than he fears us, but he fears being caught between two armies most of all.\"\n\n\nHetman Koniecpol strokes his chin. \"So Castilian reinforcements land at Split, march through Croatia and Bosnia, and join the main army somewhere in Serbia. That is—what—three weeks' march? A month?\"\n\n\n\"For infantry and baggage, yes,\" Újlaki confirms. \"Cavalry could move faster, but the terrain through Bosnia is not kind to horses.\"\n\n\nWładysław studies the map intently. \"And supplies? Can Split handle the volume needed to sustain thirty thousand additional men?\"\n\n\n\"Not alone,\" Újlaki concedes. \"But between Split, Zadar, and Ragusa—\" he indicates the independent city-state, \"—we could distribute the burden. Ragusa is neutral, but the Ragusans are merchants. They will sell us anything for the right price.\"\n\n\nHe turns to you.\n\n\n\"There is another consideration, King Juan. Your fleet's offensive operations—the raids on Ottoman shipping you described—those are best launched from the Aegean, from Greek waters. But your logistics for the land campaign must come through the Adriatic.\" He spreads his hands. \"This may require dividing your fleet. Some ships for war. Some ships for supply.\"\n\n\nOleśnicki adds quietly, \"Or securing a forward base in the Aegean. Venetian territory, perhaps. Or...\" He glances at you meaningfully. \"Constantinople itself, if your garrison there can support naval operations.\"\n\n\nThe bishop's eyes are sharp.\n\n\n\"You hold Constantinople's walls already, King Juan. You have troops there. You have the Emperor's... cooperation. If your fleet could use the Golden Horn as an anchorage, you would threaten the Dardanelles directly. The Sultan would be forced to keep ships in the east to defend his own waters—ships that could not reinforce his army in Serbia.\"\n\n\nWładysław looks up from the map, a new light in his eyes.\n\n\n\"A two-front war in truth. The army strikes from the north—Hungary and Poland pouring into Serbia. The fleet strikes from the south—threatening Ottoman shipping, perhaps even the approaches to Constantinople itself. The Sultan cannot be strong everywhere.\"\n\n\nHe turns to you.\n\n\n\"Can Constantinople serve as your naval base, King Juan? Is your position there strong enough?\""

This is exactly the kind of question that determined the success or failure of medieval campaigns.\n\nLet me think about this realistically:\n\n1. An army of 80,000 men plus horses needs enormous quantities of food and fodder\n2. The route goes through Croatia, Bosnia, and into Serbia\n3. These are not wealthy, densely populated lands like Italy or France\n4. Previous crusades often failed due to supply issues\n5. The Hungarians and Poles would know this terrain\n\nÚjlaki, as the Hungarian frontier commander, would be the expert here. Koniecpol would understand logistics from Polish campaigns. Oleśnicki would be thinking about costs.\n\nKey considerations:\n- 80,000 men need roughly 160,000-200,000 pounds of food per day (2-2.5 lbs per man)\n- Horses need 20+ pounds of fodder each per day\n- Water for men and animals\n- The land through Bosnia is mountainous and not highly productive\n- Serbia itself was war-torn from Ottoman raids\n- Foraging would be necessary but limited\n- Pre-positioning supplies along the route would be essential\n- The Danube could serve as a supply artery once they reach it\n\nThis is a serious challenge and the council should address it honestly. It's also an opportunity for Juan to demonstrate his logistical thinking and for the alliance to show it's serious about preparation.\n\nI should have the NPCs respond realistically - acknowledging the challenge, proposing solutions, and perhaps identifying this as one of the critical tasks for the 18-month preparation period.\n\n\nThe question lands heavily on the room.\n\n\nÚjlaki and Koniecpol exchange a look—the look of men who have seen campaigns founder on exactly this problem. It is Koniecpol who speaks first, his voice carrying the weight of hard experience.\n\n\n\"You ask the question that kills armies, King Juan.\" The old hetman rises stiffly and moves to the map. \"Not swords. Not arrows. Hunger. I have seen more soldiers die from empty bellies and fouled water than from Turkish steel.\"\n\n\nHe traces the route from Split toward Serbia.\n\n\n\"Eighty thousand men. Perhaps more with camp followers, servants, and teamsters. Add horses—cavalry mounts, draft animals, pack mules. We are speaking of...\" He calculates silently. \"Perhaps one hundred thousand mouths. Human and animal together.\"\n\n\nÚjlaki picks up the thread. \"Each man needs two pounds of bread or grain per day, at minimum. More if they are marching hard. Each horse needs twenty pounds of fodder—oats, hay, grass. Multiply that by one hundred thousand, by the weeks of campaign...\"\n\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\n\"The land cannot support it. Not through foraging alone. Croatia is not wealthy. Bosnia is mountainous, poor, and the Bosnians will hide their stores rather than sell to armies—they have learned this from generations of war. Serbia itself has been raided by the Ottomans for decades. The villages are impoverished. The fields are half-abandoned.\"\n\n\n\"This is why crusades fail,\" Oleśnicki says quietly. \"Not for lack of courage. For lack of bread.\"\n\n\n\nBut Újlaki raises a hand.\n\n\n\"This does not mean it cannot be done. It means it must be planned.\"\n\n\nHe points to the Danube.\n\n\n\"The river is our salvation. From Buda—\" his finger traces the great waterway, \"—barges can carry grain, salted meat, fodder, all the way to Belgrade and beyond. Hungarian grain from the plains around the Tisza. Polish grain shipped down the Vistula to Gdańsk, then by sea to the Adriatic, and overland to the Danube ports. The river becomes our supply line.\"\n\n\nKoniecpol nods slowly. \"We did this against the Teutonic Knights. Pre-positioned stores. Designated depots every fifty miles. The army moves from depot to depot, never more than two days from supply.\"\n\n\n\"For the Castilian force landing at Split,\" Újlaki continues, \"the challenge is greater. You must cross Croatia and Bosnia before you reach the Danube.\" He traces the overland route. \"Three hundred miles through difficult country. But—\" he taps several points, \"—if we establish depots in advance. Here, at Zagreb. Here, at Banja Luka. Here, at the Sava crossing. Your army marches from depot to depot. Difficult, but possible.\"\n\n\nWładysław has been listening intently. \"This requires gold. Vast quantities of grain purchased, transported, stored. Warehouses built or commandeered. Guards to prevent theft.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty,\" Oleśnicki confirms. \"This is why eighteen months of preparation is not excessive—it is necessary. We must begin purchasing grain now, before word spreads of our intentions and prices rise. We must negotiate with the Bosnians for passage rights and depot locations. We must hire riverboats on the Danube.\"\n\n\nHe turns to you.\n\n\n\"Castile is wealthy, King Juan. The silver of Granada, the gold of Africa—we have heard of your treasury's growth. Poland and Hungary can contribute, but our resources are more limited. If this campaign is to be properly supplied...\"\n\n\nHe leaves the implication hanging.\n\n\n\nKoniecpol, ever practical, pulls out a worn tablet and begins scratching figures.\n\n\n\"Let us calculate roughly. Eighty thousand men, ninety days of active campaign—that is the maximum before winter forces us to halt. Two pounds of grain per man per day...\"\n\n\nHe mutters numbers.\n\n\n\"Fourteen million pounds of grain. For men alone. Add fodder for horses—another forty or fifty million pounds if we have twenty thousand cavalry mounts and draft animals.\" He looks up. \"This is not impossible. Poland's annual grain harvest is perhaps two hundred million pounds in a good year. Hungary's is similar. But we cannot strip our own lands bare, or our people starve while our soldiers march.\"\n\n\n\"Imported grain, then,\" Tarnowski says. \"From the German lands. From Venice. From... Castile itself?\"\n\n\nÚjlaki shakes his head. \"Shipping grain from Castile to Split would be enormously expensive. Better to use Castilian gold to purchase grain closer to the theater. Venetian merchants will sell us Sicilian grain—\" he glances at you, \"—or Neapolitan grain, from Your Majesty's own Italian territories. Shipped across the Adriatic to Split and up the coast to the Dalmatian ports.\"\n\n\nThe Hungarian ban straightens.\n\n\n\"This is my proposal: a joint logistics commission, established immediately. Hungarian, Polish, and Castilian representatives working together to identify needs, purchase supplies, establish depots. We have eighteen months. If we use them wisely, the army will be fed. If we waste them in talk and delay...\"\n\n\nHe draws a finger across his throat.\n\n\n\"The Turks will not need to fight us. They will simply wait for us to starve.\"\n\n\n\nWładysław looks around the table, then settles his gaze on you.\n\n\n\"King Juan. This is the unsexy truth of war—grain and fodder, depots and barges. Can Castile commit the gold necessary to make this campaign possible? And can you spare men to work alongside ours in building the supply network?\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"I ask not to question your commitment, but because I must know. Poland will empty its treasury for this war. Hungary will do the same. But even together, we may not have enough. If Castile cannot match our sacrifice with your greater wealth...\"\n\n\nThe young king's voice is steady, but his eyes betray the weight of what he is asking.\n\n\n\"...then we must know now, before we promise what we cannot deliver.\""

The real expense comes from moving these supplies through hostile territory—transporting goods across Bosnia is costly, warehousing requires construction and guards, and I need to account for spoilage running 10-20%. Then there are administrative expenses, payments to local lords for safe passage, and depot security. These overhead costs likely double or triple the base supply expense, bringing the total to somewhere around 200,000-250,000 florins for the full operation.\n\n\nÚjlaki glances at Koniecpol.

Fodder is cheaper—half a florin to one florin per hundredweight. But we must also account for transport.\"\n\n\nHe traces the route on the map.\n\n\n\"From the Croatian coast to Zagreb—relatively easy. Good roads, friendly territory. From Zagreb through Bosnia to the Sava crossing—difficult. Mountain passes, poor roads, Bosnian lords who will demand gifts for passage.\" His tone makes clear what he thinks of such gifts. \"Every mile inland multiplies the cost.\"\n\n\nThe Hungarian ban pulls the parchment toward him and begins writing.\n\n\n\"Raw supplies: grain, fodder, preserved meat, salt, wine.

They want to understand what additional costs they should expect for feeding their 30,000 men during the active campaign season in Serbia.\n\nThis is a practical logistics question. I should have the Hungarian and Polish military experts answer based on their knowledge of the region, the Danube supply system, and the realities of campaigning in the Balkans.\n\nKey factors:\n1. Once in Serbia, the Castilians join the combined army and share the Danube supply line\n2. Some foraging will be possible, but Serbia has been raided by Ottomans for decades - not wealthy\n3. The campaign is expected to last 90 days (spring through autumn)\n4. The Danube provides a much cheaper supply route than overland through Bosnia\n5. Living off the land is risky - they're trying to liberate Serbia, not pillage it\n6. Costs should be shared among the three kingdoms once combined\n\nLet me think about realistic numbers:\n- 30,000 men for 90 days of campaign\n- Danube supply is cheaper than overland\n- Some foraging possible but limited\n- Need to factor in shared vs. individual costs\n- The political consideration of not alienating potential Serbian allies\n\nThe costs should be significantly lower per day once on the Danube system, but still substantial for 90 days.

The Danube becomes your lifeline. Barges can carry twenty times what a mule train carries, at a fraction of the cost. Grain from Hungary flows downriver to the army.

Or—\" his jaw tightens, \"—you will take food from the very people you came to liberate, and they will hate you as much as they hate the Turks. I have seen this happen. Crusaders who came as saviors, remembered as locusts.\"\n\n\n\nWładysław speaks up, his voice thoughtful.\n\n\n\"This is a matter of policy as much as logistics. If we strip Serbia bare, we win a campaign but lose a kingdom. Despot Đurađ will not thank us for liberating him into famine.\"\n\n\n\"Precisely, Your Majesty,\" Oleśnicki murmurs. \"The political dimension cannot be separated from the practical.\"\n\n\nÚjlaki pulls the parchment back and begins fresh calculations.\n\n\n\"Let us assume a ninety-day campaign—late spring through summer, withdrawing before autumn rains. Thirty thousand Castilians. The question is: what portion of supply comes from depots, what portion from foraging, what portion from local purchase?\"\n\n\nHe writes as he speaks.\n\n\n\"My recommendation: plan for seventy percent from depots and river supply. Twenty percent from foraging—this is unavoidable; armies forage, it is their nature. But controlled foraging, with strict discipline. Ten percent from local purchase at fair prices—this puts coin in Serbian hands and builds goodwill.\"\n\n\nKoniecpol grunts agreement. \"Seventy-thirty is sustainable. More foraging than that, and discipline breaks down. Less, and you are hauling impossible quantities.\"\n\n\n\nÚjlaki continues his calculations.\n\n\n\"Ninety days. Thirty-five thousand mouths including camp followers. Ten thousand animals. Seventy percent from supply...\"\n\n\nHis stylus scratches.\n\n\n\"Daily requirement from depots: roughly fifty thousand pounds of grain and fodder combined. Over ninety days... four and a half million pounds.\"\n\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\n\"But here is the advantage of the Danube. Hungarian grain costs one florin per hundredweight at the source. River transport to Serbia adds perhaps a quarter florin. Call it one and a quarter florins per hundredweight delivered.\"\n\n\nMore calculations.\n\n\n\"Four and a half million pounds at one and a quarter florins per hundredweight...\"\n\n\nHe writes the figure.\n\n\n\"Roughly fifty-six thousand florins for grain and fodder.\"\n\n\n\"Add meat, salt, wine, medicine, replacement equipment—the things that keep an army healthy. Another twenty percent.\"\n\n\n\"Call it sixty-eight thousand florins for basic supply.\"\n\n\n\n\"Now,\" Újlaki continues, \"the question of cost-sharing.\"\n\n\nHe looks around the table.\n\n\n\"Once the armies combine, we propose that supply costs be shared proportionally by the number of men each kingdom contributes. If Castile brings thirty thousand of eighty thousand total—roughly thirty-seven percent—then Castile bears thirty-seven percent of the combined supply cost.\"\n\n\nKoniecpol adds, \"This is standard practice for allied armies. Each kingdom feeds its own men during the march. Once combined, costs are pooled and divided.\"\n\n\nOleśnicki produces a document from his stack.\n\n\n\"We have estimated the total campaign supply cost for the combined army at approximately four hundred thousand florins over ninety days. This includes the Danube depot system, river transport, forward magazines, and the administrative apparatus to manage it all.\"\n\n\nHe slides the document toward you.\n\n\n\"Castile's proportional share—thirty-seven percent—would be approximately one hundred fifty thousand florins for the campaign proper.\"\n\n\n\nESTIMATED CASTILIAN COSTS: SERBIAN CAMPAIGN\n\nPhase\nCost (Florins)\nMarch to Serbia (depots, Split to frontier)\n210,000 - 250,000\nCampaign supply (90 days, proportional share)\n140,000 - 160,000\nTOTAL SUPPLY COSTS\n350,000 - 410,000\n\n\nWładysław leans forward.\n\n\n\"So. Approximately four hundred thousand florins to feed the Castilian army from Barcelona to Serbia and through a full campaign season.\" He pauses. \"This does not include pay for soldiers, replacement weapons, horses lost in battle, or the thousand other costs of war. Only food.\"\n\n\nThe young king's eyes meet yours.\n\n\n\"It is a great deal of gold, King Juan. But it is not an impossible sum for a kingdom of five crowns.\" A slight smile. \"And it is considerably less than the cost of losing.\"\n\n\nÚjlaki adds one final note.\n\n\n\"There is also the matter of plunder.\"\n\n\nThe word hangs in the air.\n\n\n\"If we defeat the Ottoman army—if we take their camp, their baggage, their treasury—the spoils will be significant. Ottoman armies travel with gold to pay troops and purchase supplies. A major victory could recover much of what we spend.\"\n\n\nKoniecpol's scarred face twists into something approaching a smile.\n\n\n\"The Turks have grown fat on Christian gold for generations. It would be... fitting... to take some of it back.\""

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed generous gift impact and strategized optimal port acquisition for logistics.\n\nThe player is making a significant gesture - offering 100,000 florins as a gift to Poland to help with war costs. This is a substantial sum and shows commitment. He's also asking about ports that could improve logistics from the sea.\n\nLet me think about the geography:\n- Currently they're talking about landing at Split and marching overland through Bosnia\n- The question is about other ports that could make sea supply easier\n- The key constraint is that Serbia is landlocked and the Danube flows to the Black Sea, which requires passing through Ottoman-controlled waters (Bosphorus/Dardanelles)\n\nPotential ports to consider:\n1. **Thessaloniki (Salonika)** - Currently Ottoman-controlled. A major port on the Aegean, much closer to Serbia than Split. If captured, it would provide direct sea access to the Balkans.\n\n2. **Ragusa (Dubrovnik)** - Independent city-state, neutral merchants. Could be used but they're careful about angering the Ottomans.\n\n3. **Albanian ports** - Durazzo (Durrës), Valona (Vlorë) - some are under Venetian control, others contested. Closer to Serbia than Split but still require overland march.\n\n4. **Zeta/Montenegro coast** - Various small ports, complicated political situation.\n\n5. **Greek ports** - Various Venetian-controlled ports in the Peloponnese and islands, but far from Serbia.\n\nThe really game-changing answer would be **Thessaloniki**. It's the second city of the Byzantine Empire historically, a major port, and would provide direct access to Macedonia and then into Serbia from the south. But it's been Ottoman since 1430.\n\nIf the fleet could take Thessaloniki as part of the campaign, it would:\n- Provide a major Aegean port for the Castilian fleet\n- Create a second front, forcing Ottomans to divide forces\n- Dramatically shorten supply lines to the army in Serbia\n\n\n- Allow reinforcements and supplies to flow directly from the south\n\nThis is the strategic advantage worth highlighting - capturing Thessaloniki would fundamentally reshape the campaign's logistics. As for the 100,000 florin offer, that's a third of Poland's entire annual military budget, which should demonstrate serious commitment to the alliance and make a strong impression on Koniecpol.\n\n\nThe room goes still.\n\n\nOne hundred thousand florins. Given freely. Not a loan, not an investment—a gift.\n\n\nWładysław's composure cracks for just a moment. You see the young king's eyes widen before he masters himself. Oleśnicki's perpetual calculation falters; even the bishop seems genuinely surprised. Koniecpol lets out a low whistle—the sound of a soldier who has spent his career scraping for every groat.\n\n\n\"King Juan.\" Władysław's voice is carefully controlled, but there is emotion beneath it. \"That is... extraordinarily generous. Poland will not forget this.\"\n\n\nOleśnicki recovers first, ever the diplomat. \"Such a gift cements the alliance more firmly than any treaty. Your Majesty's commitment to this cause is beyond question.\" He pauses, then adds quietly, \"We will ensure the funds are spent wisely. On grain and steel, not on courtiers' silks.\"\n\n\nKoniecpol simply nods—a soldier's acknowledgment of a debt that cannot be repaid in words.\n\n\n\nBut you have asked another question, and Újlaki seizes on it with the intensity of a man who has been thinking about exactly this problem for years.\n\n\n\"Other ports.\" He moves to the map, his finger tracing the coastline. \"You have identified the fundamental weakness of our current plan. Split is adequate, but it is far. Every mile between port and army is a mile where supplies can be lost, stolen, delayed, or spoiled.\"\n\n\nHis finger moves south along the Adriatic coast, then rounds the heel of Greece into the Aegean.\n\n\n\"The port that would transform this campaign—the port that would make supplying the army ten times easier—is here.\"\n\n\nHe stabs his finger down on a city marked at the head of a great bay.\n\n\n\"Thessaloniki.\"\n\n\n\nThe name hangs in the air.\n\n\n\"Second city of the old Byzantine Empire,\" Oleśnicki murmurs. \"The gateway to Macedonia.\"\n\n\n\"Fallen to the Turks in 1430,\" Újlaki confirms. \"Nine years ago. The Venetians held it briefly before that, bought it from the desperate Greeks, but they could not hold it against Murad's army.\"\n\n\nHe traces the geography with his finger.\n\n\n\"Look at where it sits. At the head of the Thermaic Gulf, with deep water harbor. From Thessaloniki, you can march north through the Vardar valley—\" his finger follows the river, \"—directly into the heart of Serbia. One hundred fifty miles to Skopje. Another one hundred fifty to the Serbian frontier. All of it through river valleys, not mountain passes.\"\n\n\nThe Hungarian ban's eyes are bright with strategic vision.\n\n\n\"If we held Thessaloniki, your fleet could sail directly from Barcelona—or from Constantinople—and unload supplies within two weeks' march of the army. No Bosnian mountains. No bribes to Bosnian lords. No thousand-mile detour through the Adriatic.\"\n\n\nKoniecpol leans forward, studying the map. \"The Vardar valley is good country for moving armies. I have read the Roman accounts—they used this route for centuries. Wide valley floor, gentle grades, river for water and transport.\"\n\n\n\nWładysław frowns thoughtfully. \"But Thessaloniki is Ottoman. Strongly held. Taking it would require—\"\n\n\n\"A siege,\" Újlaki finishes. \"Yes. A significant operation. But consider—\" he gestures at the map, \"—what if the fleet's objective is not merely to raid Ottoman shipping, but to take Thessaloniki?\"\n\n\nHe begins pacing, the words coming faster now.\n\n\n\"King Juan has said his fleet can match the Ottomans ship for ship. He holds Constantinople. He has thirty thousand men who must sail somewhere.\" Újlaki spins back to face the table. \"What if they do not land at Split at all? What if they sail to the Aegean, combine with whatever forces can be spared from Constantinople, and assault Thessaloniki directly?\"\n\n\nOleśnicki's eyes narrow. \"You are proposing to divide our forces. The army marches from Hungary into Serbia. The fleet attacks Thessaloniki from the sea. Two separate campaigns.\"\n\n\n\"Two campaigns that support each other,\" Újlaki counters. \"Think like Murad. He receives word that eighty thousand Christians are marching into Serbia from the north. He musters his army, marches to meet them. And then—\" the ban slaps the map, \"—he learns that Thessaloniki is under siege. That a Castilian fleet is threatening his Aegean coast. That Constantinople itself may sally forth.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"What does he do? He cannot be in two places at once. If he marches north to face us, Thessaloniki falls and we have a dagger pointed at his heart. If he turns south to relieve Thessaloniki, we pour into Serbia unopposed.\"\n\n\n\nKoniecpol strokes his chin. \"It is bold. Perhaps too bold. Divided forces can be defeated in detail.\"\n\n\n\"Only if the enemy can concentrate against each in turn,\" Újlaki replies. \"But the distances involved—Serbia to Thessaloniki—are too great. By the time Murad marches from one theater to the other, the situation has changed. He is always reacting, never controlling.\"\n\n\nWładysław has been studying the map intently. Now he looks up.\n\n\n\"King Juan. You know siege warfare. You took Granada. You broke the walls of cities that had held for centuries.\" The young king's voice is intent. \"Could your fleet take Thessaloniki? Is it possible?\"\n\n\nHe gestures at the map.\n\n\n\"If Ban Újlaki is right—if Thessaloniki is the key—then perhaps the entire shape of this campaign should change. Not a march through Bosnia to join a Hungarian army, but a naval assault on the Ottoman flank. Your army takes Thessaloniki, secures the port, and then marches north to meet us in Serbia.\"\n\n\nThe young king's eyes are bright.\n\n\n\"Two armies. Two directions. One purpose. The Ottomans crushed between us like grain between millstones.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you.\n\n\n\"What say you, King Juan? Is Thessaloniki within your reach?\""

      "say": "Thought process: Validated cautious military strategy, anticipated council approval.\n\nJuan is pushing back against the Thessaloniki plan, advocating for caution and concentration of forces. This is actually a wise strategic decision - avoiding the division of forces that historically led to disasters like Varna. He wants to:\n\n1. Stick with the original plan - combine forces in Serbia by May\n2. Let Constantinople forces conduct independent operations that can fall back to the city walls if needed\n3. Consider Thessaloniki as a potential objective for YEAR TWO, not year one\n4. Emphasize this is a multi-year campaign\n\nThis is prudent strategy. I should show how the council reacts to this. Koniecpol especially should appreciate the caution - he's an old soldier who has seen divided forces destroyed. Újlaki proposed the bold plan but should accept the logic. Władysław might be slightly disappointed (he's young and eager for glory) but should recognize the wisdom.\n\nThis doesn't need a persuasion roll - Juan isn't asking for anything new, he's actually being MORE cautious than what was proposed. The council should respect this.\n\n\nKoniecpol exhales slowly—the sound of a man relieved.\n\n\n\"Thank God,\" the old hetman mutters, loud enough to be heard. \"A king who understands concentration of force.\"\n\n\nHe rises from his seat and moves to the map, tapping it with a gnarled finger.\n\n\n\"This is wisdom, King Juan. I have seen armies destroyed piecemeal because some clever strategist thought he could be in two places at once. The Turks are masters of interior lines—they move fast, they strike hard, they destroy one force before the other can react.\" He shakes his head. \"Bold plans make for good songs. Cautious plans make for living soldiers.\"\n\n\nÚjlaki accepts the rejection gracefully. \"I do not disagree, King Juan. The Thessaloniki plan was... ambitious. Perhaps too ambitious for a first campaign.\" He returns to his seat. \"You are right to prioritize combination. Eighty thousand men in one place is a hammer that can break anything. Forty thousand in two places is two forces that can each be broken.\"\n\n\n\nWładysław's expression flickers—a moment of disappointment, quickly mastered. He is young, hungry for glory, and the image of two armies crushing the Ottomans between them clearly appealed to him. But he is also learning.\n\n\n\"You speak of years of fighting,\" the young king says slowly. \"Not one campaign. Not one glorious victory. Years.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you with new understanding.\n\n\n\"This is how you conquered Granada. Not in a single season, but over time. Fortress by fortress. Province by province.\"\n\n\nOleśnicki nods approvingly. \"His Majesty grasps the essential point. The Reconquista was not won in a day. Neither will the reconquest of the Balkans be.\"\n\n\nThe bishop folds his hands.\n\n\n\"This is, in truth, a more sustainable vision than a single dramatic stroke. If we plan for years of campaigning, we can pace ourselves. We can build supply systems that endure. We can train new soldiers to replace losses. We can turn conquered territory into bases for further advance.\"\n\n\nHe glances at Władysław.\n\n\n\"And we can learn from each campaign. What works, what fails, how the Ottomans fight, where they are weak.\"\n\n\n\nKoniecpol returns to his seat, his weathered face thoughtful.\n\n\n\"A multi-year war changes the calculation. In a single campaign, we must risk everything on one battle. If we lose, the crusade is over.\" He spreads his hands. \"But if we plan for years—if the first campaign is about establishing position rather than decisive victory—then we can afford to be patient. Take Serbia. Secure the frontier. Consolidate. And then, in the second year or third, push further.\"\n\n\nÚjlaki picks up the thread. \"Thessaloniki becomes the objective for year two or three, as King Juan suggests. By then, we will have learned how to coordinate our forces. We will have experience fighting the Ottomans together. We will have supply lines established and functioning.\"\n\n\nHe taps the map.\n\n\n\"And the Constantinople garrison—raiding, harrying, threatening—keeps the Sultan looking over his shoulder. He can never fully commit to Serbia because he must always guard his rear.\"\n\n\n\nWładysław is quiet for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice has changed—less the eager boy, more the king he is becoming.\n\n\n\"I confess, King Juan, I dreamed of a single great battle. The kind the chroniclers write about for centuries. A Grunwald against the Turks.\" He pauses. \"But you are right. Dreams are not strategy. If we stake everything on one throw of the dice and lose...\"\n\n\nHe does not finish the sentence. He does not need to.\n\n\n\"Poland will commit to a multi-year campaign,\" Władysław says formally. \"Hungary will do the same. We will plan not for one glorious summer, but for as many years as it takes to break Ottoman power in the Balkans.\"\n\n\nHe looks around the table.\n\n\n\"This means sustained commitment. Taxes year after year. Levies called up repeatedly. The nobility must understand that this is not a single adventure but a generational struggle.\"\n\n\nOleśnicki inclines his head. \"I will work with the Church to frame this as a sacred duty. Not one crusade, but the crusade—the great work of our age. Men will grumble at taxes, but they will pay them if they believe they are paying for salvation.\"\n\n\n\nKoniecpol pulls out a fresh sheet of parchment.\n\n\n\"Then let us plan properly. Year one: the Serbian campaign. Combine forces in May 1441. Objective—liberate Serbia, secure the Danube frontier, force the Sultan to commit his army and bleed him if we can.\"\n\n\nHe writes as he speaks.\n\n\n\"Year two: consolidation and expansion. Hold Serbia. Probe Ottoman defenses in Bulgaria and Macedonia. Perhaps—\" he glances at Újlaki, \"—begin preparations for Thessaloniki.\"\n\n\n\"Year three and beyond: dependent on results. If we hold Serbia and have broken Ottoman offensive capability, we push south. Thessaloniki. Bulgaria. Perhaps...\" He does not say Constantinople, but his eyes flick to the great city marked on the map.\n\n\nThe old hetman looks up.\n\n\n\"This is how empires are built, King Juan. Not in a day. Not in a year. Stone by stone, fortress by fortress, campaign by campaign.\"\n\n\nHe sets down his stylus.\n\n\n\"Are we agreed? Serbia first. Combination of forces.

Juan wants to bond with Władysław and learn about Polish culture. This is a natural transition after the intense strategic planning.\n\nI should have Władysław respond warmly - the young king has been impressed by Juan's wisdom and generosity, and this is an opportunity for genuine connection. The Poles did have strong hunting traditions, and there are other customs Juan might experience.\n\nLet me think about Polish traditions in the 1430s-1440s:\n- Hunting was absolutely a major noble pursuit - the great forests of Poland were famous for game including bison (żubr), boar, deer, wolves, bears\n- The Białowieża Forest was already a royal hunting preserve\n- Falconry was popular\n- There were also traditions of hospitality, feasting, horsemanship demonstrations\n- The szlachta (nobility) had particular traditions\n\nWładysław should be genuinely pleased by this request - Juan is showing interest in Poland itself, not just what Poland can do for him. This humanizes the alliance.\n\nI should have the young king light up a bit - this is something he can share, something where he's the expert rather than the student. It's a nice reversal after the war council where Juan was clearly the more experienced party.\n\n\nThe shift in topic is immediate—and so is the shift in Władysław.\n\n\nThe weight of kingship lifts from the young man's shoulders. His eyes brighten, and for the first time since the formal audience began, you see the fifteen-year-old beneath the crown.\n\n\n\"Hunts?\" A genuine smile spreads across his face. \"King Juan, you have come to the right kingdom.\"\n\n\nEven old Koniecpol chuckles, and Tarnowski—the szlachta representative who has been largely silent—suddenly leans forward with interest.\n\n\n\"Poland has the finest hunting in Christendom,\" Władysław declares with obvious pride. \"The great forests of the east—the Białowieża, the Carpathian wilderness—they hold game that has vanished from the rest of Europe. Żubr—\" he uses the Polish word, then fumbles for Latin, \"—the great forest ox. Larger than any bull you have seen. And boar that would make your Spanish jabalí look like piglets. Wolves. Bears. Stags with antlers wider than a man is tall.\"\n\n\nHe is animated now, speaking with the enthusiasm of a boy describing his favorite pursuit.\n\n\n\"My grandfather Jagiełło—the great Władysław who broke the Teutonic Knights—he was the finest hunter in Polish history. They say he could track a deer through a blizzard, that he once killed a bear with only a knife when his spear broke.\" The young king's voice carries reverence. \"I have tried to follow his example. The hunt is... it is where I feel most myself. Not in council chambers. Not in throne rooms. In the forest, with a spear in my hand and good hounds running.\"\n\n\n\nOleśnicki watches this transformation with something approaching fondness—the stern bishop momentarily softened by seeing his young charge speak with genuine passion.\n\n\n\"His Majesty is being modest,\" Oleśnicki says dryly. \"He brought down a żubr last winter that took six men to carry. The horns hang in the great hall.\"\n\n\nWładysław waves this off, but he is clearly pleased.\n\n\n\"Tomorrow—no, the day after tomorrow, we must let you rest from your journey—I will take you to the Niepołomice Forest. It is only a few hours' ride from Kraków. Royal hunting grounds since my great-grandfather's time.\" He glances at the window, gauging the season. \"September is good for boar. The beasts are fattening for winter, aggressive, dangerous.\"\n\n\nHis grin turns slightly wolfish.\n\n\n\"Have you hunted boar from horseback, King Juan? With a spear? It is... different from your Castilian style, I think. We do not use dogs to corner the beast and then dismount to kill it. We ride it down. The horse must be brave—boar will charge and gut a mount that hesitates. The spear must strike true on the first pass, or...\"\n\n\nHe mimes a tusked beast turning on a fallen rider.\n\n\n\"It makes for exciting sport.\"\n\n\n\nTarnowski speaks up, his earlier reserve forgotten.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty of Castile should also see the gonitwa—the Polish horse chase. It is... how to explain?\" He strokes his mustache. \"A competition. Riders pursue each other across open country, trying to strike with padded lances. It is how we train our cavalry, but also how we celebrate. At weddings, at festivals, after successful hunts.\"\n\n\n\"The szlachta take it very seriously,\" Władysław adds with a knowing smile. \"More seriously than actual warfare, sometimes. Reputations are made and broken in the gonitwa. A man who rides poorly will never find a good marriage, no matter how many estates he holds.\"\n\n\nKoniecpol snorts. \"The young ones care about such things. When you are my age, you care only about whether your horse can carry you home.\"\n\n\n\nWładysław rises from his seat, the formal council clearly over in his mind.\n\n\n\"There is also the biesiada—the great feast. Not like last night, which was... spontaneous.\" He has the grace to look slightly embarrassed at the memory of the raucous celebration. \"A proper biesiada is planned for days. Roasted game from the hunt served in the forest itself, under the trees. Music. Poetry—Polish lords compose verses and compete to praise their hosts or mock their rivals. Drinking contests that last until dawn.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, suddenly uncertain.\n\n\n\"I do not know Castilian customs, King Juan. Perhaps this seems... barbaric? We are not Italians with their refined courts and delicate manners. Poland is a younger kingdom. Rougher. The forests are still wild, and so are we, in some ways.\"\n\n\nThere is a question beneath the statement—a young man wondering if the sophisticated King of Five Crowns will find Polish traditions crude.\n\n\n\nÚjlaki, the Hungarian, interjects with a hint of rivalry.\n\n\n\"Hungary has fine hunting as well, Your Majesty of Castile. When the campaign takes us south, I will show you the great plains—the puszta—where we hunt on horseback with bow and arrow, in the style of our ancestors.\" He grins. \"The Poles think their forests are impressive. Wait until you see a Hungarian horseman bring down a running deer at full gallop with a single arrow.\"\n\n\nWładysław rolls his eyes. \"The Hungarians think everything they do is superior. It is their great national failing.\"\n\n\n\"It is not a failing if it is true,\" Újlaki replies serenely.\n\n\nThe exchange is good-natured—the easy ribbing of allies rather than the barbs of rivals.\n\n\n\nWładysław turns back to you.\n\n\n\"What say you, King Juan? Will you hunt with me? I would show you Poland as it truly is—not this stone castle and these endless councils, but the forests and the fields, the things that make us who we are.\"\n\n\nHis voice carries a note of genuine hope.\n\n\n\"And I would hear of Castilian traditions in turn. How do you hunt in the south? What do your people do when they are not conquering kingdoms and planning crusades?\"\n\n\nThe young king's smile is warm, open—the expression of someone who has found, against all expectation, a potential friend rather than merely an ally."

He looks at you as though seeing you clearly for the first time.\n\n\n\"We fight. We pray. We die.\"\n\n\nThe young king repeats your words softly, tasting them.\n\n\n\"That is Poland, King Juan. That is exactly Poland.\" His voice carries a weight beyond his years. \"For two hundred years we have fought. Mongols from the east—they burned Kraków to ash in my great-great-grandfather's time. Teutonic Knights from the north, in their white cloaks, calling themselves crusaders while they crusaded against us. Lithuanians before we joined with them. Bohemians. Hungarians.\" He glances at Újlaki with a slight smile. \"No offense, Ban.\"\n\n\n\"None taken, Your Majesty. We were trying to conquer you. You were right to resist.\"\n\n\nWładysław turns back to you.\n\n\n\"Every generation of my family has bled for this kingdom. My grandfather Jagiełło won Grunwald—the greatest victory in Polish history—and do you know what he did afterward? He did not build palaces or commission paintings. He built fortresses. Because he knew the Knights would come again.\"\n\n\nThe young king steps closer, his voice dropping.\n\n\n\"The French look down on us. The Italians think we are barbarians. The Germans call us the Sarmatians—wild horsemen from the steppes, barely Christian.\" Something hard enters his eyes. \"Let them. We do not fight for their approval. We fight because if we do not, Poland dies.\"\n\n\n\nKoniecpol speaks up, his weathered voice carrying the authority of a lifetime at war.\n\n\n\"His Majesty of Castile understands what many do not. There is no peace for kingdoms on the frontier of Christendom. There is only the war you are fighting now and the war you are preparing for next.\"\n\n\nThe old hetman's scarred face softens slightly.\n\n\n\"I have met knights from France, from Burgundy. They speak of war as sport. As glory. As a way to win renown and ladies' favors.\" He shakes his head. \"They do not understand. For Poland—for Castile, it seems—war is not sport. It is survival. The enemy does not want your ransom. He wants your extinction.\"\n\n\nTarnowski nods vigorously. \"This is why Polish cavalry is the finest in Europe. Not because we train for tournaments. Because we train for war. Real war, where losing means your family is enslaved and your village is ash.\"\n\n\n\nWładysław clasps your arm—the gesture of a brother, not a fellow sovereign.\n\n\n\"I think God has brought us together, King Juan. Two kingdoms forged in the same fire. Two peoples who understand what it means to hold the line while others grow soft behind us.\"\n\n\nHis smile returns, but warmer now—less the eager boy, more the young man who has found an unexpected kinship.\n\n\n\"You will not embarrass yourself on the hunt. I have seen your bearing, how you sit a horse, how you move. A man does not conquer Granada without knowing which end of a spear is sharp.\" He laughs. \"And if you struggle with the gonitwa—well, it takes years to master Polish horsemanship. The fact that you would try will earn you more respect than any victory.\"\n\n\nHe turns to address the room.\n\n\n\"Three days hence, we ride for Niepołomice. A proper hunt—boar, deer, whatever the forest offers. The lords who wish to attend may do so.\" His eyes sweep the council members. \"This includes you, Bishop. When did you last sit a horse?\"\n\n\nOleśnicki's expression is pained. \"I am a man of God, Your Majesty. The hunt is not—\"\n\n\n\"The hunt is exactly what you need. Fresh air. Exercise. A chance to remember that not everything is politics and paper.\" Władysław waves away the bishop's objection. \"Consider it a royal command.\"\n\n\n\nThe council dissolves into something less formal—men rising, stretching, speaking in smaller groups. The great questions have been settled: the alliance, the timeline, the command structure, the strategy. What remains is the human work of turning allies into brothers.\n\n\nÚjlaki approaches you as the others mill about.\n\n\n\"A word, King Juan, if I may.\"\n\n\nThe Hungarian ban's voice is low, meant for your ears alone.\n\n\n\"What you said—about Castile, about the Reconquista—it will spread through the Polish court by nightfall. These are a proud people, sensitive to any hint of condescension. You could have boasted of your five crowns, your treasury, your conquests. Instead you spoke of struggle and survival.\"\n\n\nHe inclines his head slightly.\n\n\n\"You have won more goodwill with those words than with your hundred thousand florins. The szlachta will speak of the Castilian king who understands what it means to fight for your people's existence.\" A thin smile. \"By the time you leave Poland, they will be composing songs about you. Terrible songs, with terrible rhymes—Polish poetry is not subtle—but sincere.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"Hungary is different from Poland in many ways. But in this, we are the same. We have held the frontier against the Turk for generations while the rest of Christendom sent prayers and empty promises. To find an ally who understands...\"\n\n\nThe Hungarian ban does not finish the sentence. He does not need to.\n\n\n\"I will see you at the hunt, King Juan. Try not to let the Poles show you up too badly. Hungarian honor is at stake as well.\""

The other council members are dispersing—Władysław deep in conversation with Koniecpol about arrangements for the hunt, Oleśnicki gathering his papers, Tarnowski speaking with one of the clerks.\n\n\nThe Hungarian ban steps closer, creating a pocket of relative privacy amid the departing crowd.\n\n\n\"Of course, King Juan.\"\n\n\nHis dark eyes are attentive, curious. He is a man of the frontier—practical, direct, accustomed to reading men quickly and accurately.

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed realistic military recruitment against optimistic council promises.\n\nThe player is asking Újlaki privately whether the impressive numbers discussed in the council—50,000 men from Poland and Hungary combined—are realistic. This is a shrewd question from a military commander who understands that paper strength and actual strength are often very different things.\n\nÚjlaki is Hungarian, a frontier lord who has actually fought the Ottomans. He's been portrayed as practical, direct, and honest. He would appreciate this question—it shows Juan understands the difference between what nobles promise and what they actually deliver.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for some realistic medieval political insight. The answer should be nuanced:\n- The numbers are theoretically possible\n- But getting all the nobles to actually show up is another matter\n- There are always excuses, delays, partial contributions\n- Religious and political divisions may affect turnout\n- The Hungarian frontier lords are more reliable because they face the Ottomans directly\n- The Polish szlachta further from the frontier may be less enthusiastic\n- Władysław is young—some nobles may doubt him\n- Oleśnicki's influence helps but also creates resentment\n\nI should have Újlaki give an honest, soldier's assessment of what can realistically be expected versus the optimistic council numbers.\n\n\nÚjlaki's expression shifts. The courtier's mask falls away, replaced by the weathered pragmatism of a man who has spent his life on the frontier, counting the men who actually arrived versus the men who were promised.\n\n\nHe glances around, ensuring no one is within earshot. When he speaks, his voice is low.\n\n\n\"You ask the question that keeps me awake at night, King Juan.\"\n\n\nHe moves to the window, gesturing for you to join him. Outside, the spires of Kraków catch the morning light. His voice drops further.\n\n\n\"The numbers Koniecpol cited are real—in theory. The pospolite ruszenie can summon twenty thousand Polish nobles to war. The Hungarian banderia system can raise twenty-five thousand. On parchment, this is true.\"\n\n\nHe turns to face you, arms crossed.\n\n\n\"But parchment does not bleed. Men do.\"\n\n\n\n\"In Poland,\" Újlaki continues, \"the szlachta answer the royal summons because honor demands it. But how they answer varies. Some come with full retinues, armed and provisioned for months of campaign. Others arrive with the minimum required by law—themselves, a horse, a sword—and count the days until they can return to their estates.\"\n\n\nHe holds up a hand, ticking off fingers.\n\n\n\"Distance matters. The lords of Greater Poland, near the German frontier, will ask why they should march a thousand miles to fight Turks who have never threatened their lands. The lords of the east, near Lithuania, will worry about leaving their homes undefended against Tatar raids.\" A third finger. \"And some will simply discover urgent business that prevents them from attending. A sick wife. A disputed inheritance. A harvest that cannot be left unsupervised.\"\n\n\nHis jaw tightens.\n\n\n\"Władysław is beloved, but he is fifteen. Some of the older magnates remember when they ruled Poland during his minority. They are not eager to follow a boy into war, however brave his words.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hungary is... different. And worse.\"\n\n\nÚjlaki's voice carries a bitterness born of long experience.\n\n\n\"The banderia are private armies, King Juan. Each great lord maintains his own force, equipped at his own expense, loyal to him first and the crown second. When the king calls, they come—if they choose to. If they see advantage in it. If they are not feuding with another lord whose presence they cannot tolerate.\"\n\n\nHe laughs, but there is no humor in it.\n\n\n\"I could name you a dozen Hungarian barons who would rather see the Turks win than fight alongside a rival. The Hunyadis and the Garais have been at each other's throats for a generation. The Újlakis—my own family—have enemies who would celebrate our destruction. Put us all in one army, and half our energy goes to watching our own flanks.\"\n\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\n\"And then there is the matter of Elisabeth.\"\n\n\n\n\"The succession is settled—legally,\" Újlaki says carefully. \"Władysław wears the crown. But there are lords who backed Elisabeth's claim, who believed her son should have ruled. They bent the knee because they had no choice, but their hearts are not in this reign.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"Will they march to war for a king they opposed? Perhaps. The Ottoman threat is real enough to overcome many grievances. But will they fight hard? Will they hold the line when the Turkish arrows fall like rain and the sipahis charge? Or will they look for the first excuse to withdraw, preserving their strength for... future contingencies?\"\n\n\nThe implication is clear. Some Hungarian lords are already thinking about what happens after Władysław—whether that means his death in battle or simply the next succession crisis.\n\n\n\nÚjlaki is quiet for a moment, then speaks more softly.\n\n\n\"You want truth, King Juan? Here is truth.\"\n\n\n\"Of the fifty thousand men promised, expect thirty-five thousand to actually arrive. Of those thirty-five thousand, perhaps twenty-five thousand will be reliable—men who will stand and fight when ordered, who will not melt away at the first setback.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"The rest? They will come late. They will leave early. They will guard the baggage train instead of joining the battle line. They will be present without being committed.\"\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\"This is not cowardice. It is... calculation. Every lord weighs the risk against the reward. Glory and plunder if we win. Death and ruin if we lose—and not just for them, but for their families, their lands, their people who depend on them.\"\n\n\n\n\"The men you can count on absolutely,\" Újlaki says, his voice firming, \"are the frontier lords. Hungarians who have fought the Turks their entire lives. Serbs who have lost everything and have nothing left to lose. Wallachians and Transylvanians who know that if Hungary falls, they are next.\"\n\n\nHe taps his chest.\n\n\n\"I will bring every man I can raise. So will the other marcher lords—the Hunyadis, the Szilágyi, men whose castles can see Ottoman campfires on clear nights. We do not fight for glory or politics. We fight because if we do not, our children will grow up as slaves or corpses.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you with something approaching respect.\n\n\n\"You understand this. I heard it in your words about Castile. The Reconquista was not won by lords who calculated advantage. It was won by men who had no choice but to fight.\"\n\n\n\nÚjlaki glances back at the council chamber, where Władysław is still speaking with Koniecpol.\n\n\n\"Young Władysław has fire. Real fire. He means every word he says about crusade and destiny. But meaning is not the same as achieving. When the army musters, he will learn—perhaps for the first time—how many of his loyal nobles find reasons to send half the men they promised, or arrive two weeks late, or discover urgent business elsewhere.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to you.\n\n\n\"This is why your thirty thousand Castilians matter more than numbers suggest. They are yours—disciplined, professional, answering to a single commander who has led them to victory before. They will not melt away. They will not calculate advantage. They will stand where you put them and fight until you tell them to stop.\"\n\n\nA grim smile.\n\n\n\"In a battle of eighty thousand men on paper, your thirty thousand may be the only thirty thousand that actually fight as one. That could be the difference between victory and disaster.\"\n\n\n\nHe straightens, the confession complete.\n\n\n\"You asked for truth, King Juan. There it is. I would not say this in open council—Poland's pride would be wounded, and Hungary's divisions should not be aired before foreigners. But you are not a foreigner anymore. You are the man who will command us in battle. You deserve to know what you are commanding.\"\n\n\nHe extends his hand.\n\n\n\"If we win this war, it will be because of men like you—men who ask hard questions before the spears are crossed, not after. The szlachta may compose songs about your words today. I will remember that you asked about the truth behind the numbers.\""

      "say": "Thought process: Appraised strategic wisdom of verifying troop commitments through practical muster.\n\nThe user (Juan) is telling Újlaki that he plans to hold a war council after the hunt, and that he'll conduct a muster next year to see who actually shows up versus who doesn't. This is a practical, strategic response to Újlaki's honest assessment of the reliability of Polish and Hungarian forces.\n\nThis is a significant statement - Juan is essentially saying he won't trust the paper numbers, he'll verify them through an actual muster before committing to the campaign. This is wise generalship.\n\nI should have Újlaki respond to this - he'll likely appreciate the practical wisdom of this approach. A muster before the actual campaign would:\n1. Reveal who is truly committed\n2. Allow time to address shortfalls\n3. Give Juan a realistic picture of what forces he'll actually command\n4. Send a message to wavering lords that their absence will be noted\n\nÚjlaki is a frontier lord, practical and direct. He'll appreciate this approach.\n\n\nÚjlaki's eyes widen slightly. Then a slow smile spreads across his weathered face—the smile of a man who has just watched a master craftsman at work.\n\n\n\"A muster,\" he repeats. \"Before the campaign. To see who answers.\"\n\n\nHe laughs—a genuine sound, surprised out of him.\n\n\n\"King Juan, you are a more dangerous man than I realized. And I already thought you were dangerous.\"\n\n\nHe leans against the window frame, considering the implications.\n\n\n\"A muster is... it is a statement. It says: I do not trust your promises. Prove yourselves. Show me your men, your horses, your supplies—not in the spring when the Turks are waiting, but now, when there is still time to address... shortfalls.\"\n\n\nHis smile sharpens.\n\n\n\"The lords who intended to arrive late with half their strength will be exposed. They cannot claim their men were delayed by bad roads or summer floods if the muster is in autumn. They must either produce what they promised or admit—publicly—that they cannot. Or will not.\"\n\n\n\nÚjlaki pushes off from the window, pacing slowly as he thinks aloud.\n\n\n\"It will cause grumbling. The szlachta do not like being checked like servants presenting accounts. They will say it is an insult to their honor, that a true king trusts his nobles.\"\n\n\nHe waves a hand dismissively.\n\n\n\"Let them grumble. The ones who grumble loudest will be the ones with the most to hide. The frontier lords—the men who actually fight—will welcome it. We have been carrying the weight of Poland and Hungary's defense for generations while the interior lords grow fat and send excuses. A muster forces everyone to show their hand.\"\n\n\nHe stops, turning to face you.\n\n\n\"And it gives you something else. Time. If the muster reveals that we have thirty-five thousand men instead of fifty thousand, you know this in autumn of 1440—not in spring of 1441 when the army is already marching. You can adjust your plans. Hire mercenaries to fill the gaps. Perhaps—\" he raises an eyebrow, \"—send word to other Christian princes that there is room in the crusade for men who wish to join.\"\n\n\n\n\"Where would you hold this muster?\" Újlaki asks, his tone now businesslike—a commander discussing logistics with a superior he respects.\n\n\n\"For the Hungarians, Buda is the natural choice. The great plain nearby can hold any army. For the Poles...\" He considers. \"Kraków, perhaps. Or somewhere further south, closer to the line of march. Władysław will know the ground better than I.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"You will want to be present yourself. At both musters, if possible—or send trusted representatives who can report accurately. The lords must see that the King of Castile is watching, counting, remembering. That their performance—or lack of it—will be known to the man who commands the crusade.\"\n\n\nA flicker of something—admiration, perhaps, or simply the recognition of a kindred spirit.\n\n\n\"My grandfather used to say: A lord who fears his king's memory more than his king's sword is a lord who will do his duty.\" He nods slowly. \"You are building that fear, King Juan. Quietly. Politely. But building it nonetheless.\"\n\n\n\nÚjlaki glances toward the door, where the last of the council members are departing.\n\n\n\"I will say nothing of this conversation. When you announce the muster at the war council, it should come as... a surprise. Let them see it as your idea alone, not something discussed in corners.\" His expression turns thoughtful. \"It will also be interesting to see how Władysław reacts. Whether he supports it immediately—which will tell us he understands the problem—or hesitates, which will tell us he still believes his nobles' promises.\"\n\n\nHe extends his hand once more.\n\n\n\"You honor me with your trust, King Juan. Not every commander shares his thinking with subordinates. Some prefer to appear all-knowing, never doubting, never uncertain.\" He grips your hand firmly. \"Those commanders lose wars. The ones who ask questions—who want truth instead of flattery—those are the ones I would follow into battle.\"\n\n\nHe releases your hand and steps back.\n\n\n\"I will see you at the hunt. And at the war council after. I suspect both will be... educational.\"\n\n\nA final nod, and the Hungarian ban departs, leaving you alone in the council chamber with your thoughts—and your plans."
