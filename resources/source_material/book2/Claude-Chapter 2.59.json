Parchment maps of the Balkans and Anatolia spread across the great table, weighted down by candlesticks at their corners. The morning light through the high windows catches the dust motes stirred by your officers' animated discussions of the past hour—discussions of artillery positions, of wagenburg formations, of forcing Ottoman sipahis to charge into prepared killing grounds rather than waiting for Janissary assaults.\n\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont stands at the table's edge, his English accent carrying the quiet awe of a man who has glimpsed something unprecedented. \"Your Majesty,\" he says, his weathered face still processing the implications of the doctrine you have outlined, \"shall I draft orders to contact Hunyadi regarding wagon tactics instruction? And begin planning for wagon acquisition—how many we should obtain, where to source them, whether to reinforce the beds with iron plating as the Hussites do?\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán has set aside the muster scrolls, his attention wholly on the question. Diego de Daza, pen still in hand from his budget annotations, watches quietly—a man more comfortable with florins than fieldworks, but shrewd enough to recognize that what has been discussed here may reshape the treasuries of empires.\n\n\nThe question hangs in the air, awaiting your command."

Let me now synthesize everything for Diego de Daza to present to Juan:\n\nKey points from web search:\n1. Milan was the dominant armor production center in 15th century\n2. After 1427, Milan was able to re-arm 4,000 cavalry and 2,000 infantry \"in just a few days\" from the stock of just two armourers\n3. In 1452, three armourers (coordinating contracted labor) could each equip six men-at-arms daily - 18 complete field armours daily, easily exceeding 4,500 armours per annum from just THREE armourers\n4. There were more than 70 master armourers in Milan by mid-15th century\n5. Cost of simple soldier equipment: a sallet was 3-4 livres tournois, a brigandine 11 livres tournois\n\nKey points from project files:\n1. Bilbao workshop produces 640-800 kits/year (by 1439)\n2. Total production 1435-1439: ~1,540 kits\n3. Imports possible but not quantified\n4. Standard equipment for infantry: \"Spear, shield, helmet, padded jack or better\"\n5. Heinrich Steinmann produces \"practical military equipment—hauberks, brigandines, sallets, good steel blades\"\n\nNow I need to present this information through Diego de Daza's voice, helping Juan understand:\n1. Domestic production capacity\n2. Stockpiles accumulated\n3. Import possibilities\n4. Cost estimates\n5. Total arming capacity for the 1440 muster and 1441 campaign\n\nLet me craft a realistic response that Sir Thomas or Diego would give.\n\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont listens intently to your vision—the cannons shipped ahead in autumn, waiting at Constantinople; the war wagons present at every muster point; combined artillery-infantry exercises across the realm; and the great march to Toledo for final selection. His eyes gleam with the professional appreciation of a man hearing not merely ambition but logistics.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty has grasped the essential point,\" he says. \"If the guns sail ahead, every ship in spring 1441 carries fighting men, not iron. And training with the wagons before we ever see Ottoman sipahis...\" He exchanges a glance with Captain Fernán. \"We rehearse the battle at home, not on the field where mistakes cost lives.\"\n\n\nHe begins making notes. \"I'll draft orders to contact Hunyadi immediately. We need his officers—men who've actually fought from wagenburgs—to teach our infantry how to reload behind the wagon boards, how to interlock the vehicles, how to defend the gaps.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán nods. \"The wagons themselves, Your Majesty—ordinary farm carts won't suffice. The Hussites reinforced theirs with iron plates, added gunports, fitted chains to link them. If we want wagons ready at every muster point by spring, carpenters must begin work this winter. Perhaps two hundred wagons? Three hundred? The numbers depend on how we intend to deploy them.\"\n\n\nDiego de Daza clears his throat—he has been silent through the military discussion, but at the mention of arming men from the royal armory, his domain beckons.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty asks how many men the Crown can properly equip.\" He consults his memory, not his ledgers—these figures he knows. \"The Bilbao workshop under Master Steinmann has produced approximately twenty-five hundred complete soldier's kits since 1435—hauberks or brigandines, sallets, good steel blades. Some of these have gone to the Crown Soldiers, the Crown Marshalls, the Constantinople garrison. Perhaps eighteen hundred remain in royal stores, distributed across the armories of Toledo, Segovia, and Burgos.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Master Steinmann's workshop now produces six to seven hundred kits annually. If we push them—additional payments, priority on materials—perhaps eight hundred by late 1440. But that is still only eight hundred men equipped from domestic production.\"\n\n\n\"For the numbers Your Majesty contemplates,\" Diego continues carefully, \"we must import. Milan is the great arsenal of Christendom. Three Milanese armourers, coordinating contracted labor, can produce eighteen complete field armours daily—exceeding four thousand harnesses per year from just three workshops. The city has more than seventy master armourers. If we place large orders now—this winter—we could receive substantial shipments by autumn 1440.\"\n\n\nHe does some mental arithmetic. \"The cost is considerable. A complete infantry kit—brigandine, sallet, sword, spear—runs perhaps twelve to fifteen florins for serviceable Milanese work. More for quality. If Your Majesty wishes to equip, say, five thousand men beyond what they bring themselves, that represents sixty to seventy-five thousand florins. Plus shipping from Genoa or Venice.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas interjects: \"Many of the nobles and hidalgos who answer the muster will come armed—their equipment is their honor. The men who need Crown equipment are the yeomen, the common soldiers, the volunteers who have courage but no mail. If we're selecting the best from a muster of potentially fifteen to twenty thousand men for a campaign force of twenty-nine thousand across all territories...\"\n\n\n\"The question,\" Diego says, \"is what proportion require Crown arms versus their own. If half come equipped and half need outfitting, fourteen to fifteen thousand kits. But that assumes...\"\n\n\nHe trails off, clearly overwhelmed by the scale.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty's treasury stands at over 1.3 million florins,\" he finally says. \"The cost is... not impossible. But the time to place orders is now, before the Italian workshops commit their production to other buyers. And we would need agents in Milan—trustworthy men who can inspect quality, negotiate prices, and arrange transport.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas looks at you. \"Do we have such agents, Your Majesty? Or shall I include that in my correspondence to our Italian contacts?\""

      "say": "Thought process: Synthesized domestic and foreign production capacity into armed force estimates.\n\nThe user is asking for a concrete calculation of how many men can be armed using:\n1. Domestic production from the Bilbao workshop\n2. A large order from Milan\n\nLet me work through the numbers based on what I've found:\n\n**Domestic Production (Bilbao - Steinmann Consortium):**\n- Current stock in royal stores: ~1,800 kits (after allocations to Crown Soldiers, Marshalls, Constantinople garrison)\n- Annual production 1439: 600-800 kits\n- If pushed for 1440: potentially 800 kits\n\nSo by late 1440, domestic availability would be:\n- 1,800 existing stock\n- Plus ~700-800 new production in 1440\n- Total: ~2,500-2,600 kits from domestic sources\n\n**Milan Import:**\nThe research showed:\n- Milan had enormous production capacity - 70+ master armourers\n- Three armourers could produce 18 complete field armours daily (4,500+ per year from just 3 workshops)\n- The city could re-arm an army of 6,000 men \"in just a few days\" after Maclodio in 1427\n\nSo Milan could theoretically produce thousands of kits. The limiting factors would be:\n1. Lead time (order now in late 1439, receive by autumn 1440)\n2. Cost\n3. Shipping logistics\n\n**Costs:**\n- Diego mentioned 12-15 florins for a complete infantry kit (brigandine, sallet, sword, spear) for \"serviceable Milanese work\"\n- More for quality\n\nLet me think about realistic numbers:\n- If Juan orders in winter 1439/40 for delivery by autumn 1440, that gives Milan ~9-10 months\n- A large order might be 5,000-10,000 kits\n- Milan could certainly produce this - they had capacity for much more\n\nLet's say:\n- Domestic: 2,500 kits (existing stock + 1440 production)\n\n\n- Milan order: 5,000-8,000 kits is realistic given the timeline and Milan's capacity. At 12-15 florins per kit, that's 60,000-75,000 florins for 5,000 units or 96,000-120,000 for 8,000. Shipping from Genoa or Venice would add additional costs on top of the purchase price.\n\nThis gives me two scenarios for total armed forces: conservatively around 7,500 men combining domestic production with the Milan order, or more aggressively closer to 10,600 men. I should have Diego work through these numbers—he's the logical choice to present the financial breakdown and force projections.\n\n\nDiego de Daza's fingers move instinctively, as though reaching for an abacus that isn't there. His lips move silently through calculations before he speaks.\n\n\n\"From domestic sources, Your Majesty: approximately eighteen hundred complete kits currently in royal armories. Master Steinmann's workshop will produce another seven to eight hundred by autumn 1440 if we give them priority. Call it twenty-five hundred kits from Bilbao.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, organizing his thoughts. \"Milan is another matter. The capacity exists—their workshops supplied entire armies after battlefield disasters. The question is what we can reasonably order and receive within the timeframe. If we dispatch an agent this winter with authority to contract, and the Milanese begin work in January...\"\n\n\nHe counts months on his fingers. \"January to September—nine months. A consortium of workshops taking a major Crown order could produce five to six thousand complete infantry kits in that time without straining. Seven or eight thousand if we pay premiums for priority and accept that some pieces may come from different workshops rather than matched sets.\"\n\n\n\"The cost.\" Diego's expression becomes that of a man delivering difficult news. \"Serviceable Milanese infantry equipment—brigandine, sallet, sword, spear, and dagger—runs twelve to fifteen florins per man at standard rates. A bulk Crown order of this size might negotiate slightly better, perhaps eleven to fourteen florins. But we'd also pay premiums for priority production.\"\n\n\nHe produces figures:\n\n\n\"Conservative order—five thousand kits at thirteen florins average: sixty-five thousand florins for the equipment itself. Add transport from Genoa to Cartagena or Seville—perhaps eight thousand florins for shipping that volume. Agent expenses, inspection fees, contingencies—another five thousand. Total: approximately seventy-eight thousand florins.\"\n\n\n\"Aggressive order—eight thousand kits at fourteen florins average: one hundred twelve thousand florins for equipment. Shipping perhaps twelve thousand. Expenses and contingencies seven thousand. Total: approximately one hundred thirty-one thousand florins.\"\n\n\nHe looks up. \"Combined with domestic production, Your Majesty could equip:\"\n\n\n\"Conservative approach: Twenty-five hundred domestic plus five thousand Milanese equals seventy-five hundred men fully armed from Crown stores, at a cost of roughly eighty thousand florins beyond what we've already invested in Bilbao.\"\n\n\n\"Aggressive approach: Twenty-five hundred domestic plus eight thousand Milanese equals ten thousand five hundred men fully armed, at a cost of roughly one hundred thirty thousand florins.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas strokes his chin. \"Ten thousand men in Crown equipment, plus the nobles and hidalgos who bring their own arms... If even half the muster comes properly equipped, and we outfit the other half from these stores, we could field a fully armored force of twenty thousand or more from Castilian territories alone.\"\n\n\nDiego nods slowly. \"The treasury can bear either expenditure, Your Majesty. Even the aggressive approach consumes less than ten percent of our reserves. The question is whether Milan can deliver, and whether we trust our agent to inspect the quality. Milanese workshops are honest by reputation—but a rushed order invites shortcuts.\"\n\n\nHe adds one final consideration: \"There is also the matter of standardization. If our men train with Bilbao equipment and then receive Milanese arms, the fit and handling will differ slightly. Not disastrously, but noticeably. The Tétouan campaign might serve as opportunity to identify any issues before we sail east.\"\n\n\nThe morning light has shifted; the war council has been in session for some time now. The maps still spread across the table, but the discussion has moved from grand strategy to the practical matter of iron and florins.\n\n\n\"Shall I draft terms for a Milanese purchasing agent, Your Majesty?\" Diego asks. \"And if so—conservative or aggressive?\""

      "say": "Thought process: Examined medieval equipment ownership precedents and administrative solutions.\n\nThe user is asking two important questions:\n\n1. How to handle possession of Crown-provided armor - preventing people from selling it\n2. How to handle fairness for men who already have their own equipment vs those receiving free armor\n\nThese are genuinely good medieval administrative questions. Let me think about how NPCs would respond to this.\n\nDiego de Daza would handle the administrative/legal aspects - this is his domain. Sir Thomas might comment on military precedent.\n\nHistorical context: In medieval armies, equipment was often:\n- Personal property of the soldier (most common for knights/men-at-arms)\n- Provided by a lord and returned after service\n- Issued from royal/state armories with expectation of return\n\nThe Byzantine system (which Juan has experience with via Constantinople) used the thematic system where equipment was often provided initially but holders were expected to maintain it.\n\nThe user raises legitimate concerns:\n1. Soldiers selling armor for quick cash\n2. Soldiers who saved and bought their own equipment feeling cheated when others get free armor\n\nPossible solutions:\n1. Crown retains ownership - equipment is loaned, not given\n2. Equipment must be returned after campaign or upon death\n3. Equipment marked with royal symbols to prevent easy sale\n4. Penalties for selling/losing Crown equipment\n5. For those with own equipment: some kind of compensation or recognition\n\nLet me have Diego and Sir Thomas discuss these options realistically.\n\n\nDiego de Daza's eyes brighten—this is precisely the kind of administrative problem he relishes. Sir Thomas, too, leans forward; the question touches on military discipline as much as treasury management.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty identifies the two thorns that plague every prince who arms his subjects,\" Diego says. \"The man who sells his issued mail for wine, and the man who scrimped for years to buy his own harness and now watches his neighbor receive better for nothing.\"\n\n\nHe begins thinking aloud. \"The Byzantine system—which Your Majesty knows well from the Taktikon—treats military equipment as Crown property on permanent loan. The soldier uses it, maintains it, fights in it, but never owns it. Upon death or discharge, it returns to the armory. The Iota brand serves this purpose admirably: armor marked with the royal symbol cannot be sold legitimately. Any merchant buying Iota-marked equipment knows he purchases stolen Crown property.\"\n\n\n\"We could establish the same principle,\" he continues. \"Equipment issued from royal stores remains Crown property. The soldier signs a receipt—or makes his mark—acknowledging custody. If he deserts, sells, or loses the equipment through negligence, he owes the Crown its value. If he dies in service or is honorably discharged, it returns to stores for the next man.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas nods. \"The English do something similar with longbows. Crown property, issued for service, returned or accounted for. It works—mostly. The difficulty is enforcement when armies disperse after campaign.\"\n\n\n\"Which brings us to the second problem,\" Diego says. \"The man who armed himself.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, clearly having given this thought before. \"There are several approaches, Your Majesty. First, we might offer such men a choice: surrender your personal equipment to the Crown in exchange for superior Milanese kit marked with the Iota, which you then hold under the same terms as everyone else. Some will prefer the better armor; others will cling to what is theirs.\"\n\n\n\"Second,\" he continues, \"we might pay them. A man who arrives at muster with his own serviceable equipment—inspected and approved—receives a bonus. Perhaps five florins for infantry kit, ten for cavalry equipment. This acknowledges his investment without creating resentment. The Crown still saves money compared to equipping him entirely.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas interjects: \"There's a third consideration, Your Majesty. Pride. A hidalgo who scraped together his grandfather's hauberk and his father's sword carries more than iron—he carries honor. If we offer him 'better' equipment, we may insult him. But if we offer recognition...\" He trails off thoughtfully.\n\n\n\"What if men who provide their own arms receive some mark of distinction?\" he suggests. \"A badge, a title—Armiger Proprius, perhaps, 'Self-Armed Man.' It costs nothing but carries honor. They equipped themselves; they need no royal charity. Meanwhile, those in Crown equipment serve proudly under the Iota, knowing their king provided for them.\"\n\n\nDiego picks up the thread. \"We could formalize this in the muster records. Two categories: men equipped at Crown expense, whose armor remains Crown property; and men equipped at personal expense, who receive the recognition bonus and the honorific. Both serve equally, but each is acknowledged appropriately.\"\n\n\nHe pulls out a scrap of parchment and begins sketching figures. \"If we assume the aggressive Milanese order—say seven thousand quality kits with the Iota mark, accounting for the uniformity requirements—and twenty-five hundred from Bilbao, we have approximately nine to ten thousand Crown kits available.\"\n\n\n\"If half the men at muster arrive self-equipped and receive the five-florin bonus, and half receive Crown equipment...\" He calculates. \"For a Castilian muster of fifteen thousand, that's seventy-five hundred bonuses at five florins—thirty-seven thousand five hundred florins—plus the cost of the Milanese order.\"\n\n\nHe looks up. \"The total program might run one hundred seventy thousand florins: armor, shipping, bonuses, and administration. Still well within treasury capacity, and we end the campaign with the armor returned to stores for future use, while self-equipped men keep what is theirs.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán, who has been quiet, speaks up. \"There's one more matter, Your Majesty. What of men whose personal equipment fails inspection? A rusted hauberk, a cracked helmet, a blade that won't hold an edge? Do we turn them away, or equip them from Crown stores and treat them as Crown-equipped men?\"\n\n\nThe question hangs in the air—another practical detail in the vast machinery of raising an army."

Then I should probably wrap up this planning session or see if there are other matters to address.\n\nI need to be careful not to drag this out too long - the player has made their decisions, so I should confirm, add some color/detail from the NPCs, and then either move on or ask what's next.\n\n\nDiego nods, making notes. \"Practical wisdom, Your Majesty. A man in a dented breastplate fights better than a man in a gambeson alone.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas's weathered face creases with approval. \"Repair stations. Yes. Every army I've served in had farriers for the horses and surgeons for the men, but the armor was left to fend for itself. If we station smiths at Toledo during the great muster—men who can hammer out dents, rivet loose plates, replace rotted straps—we improve the whole army's readiness at modest cost.\"\n\n\nHe warms to the idea. \"Master Steinmann's trained Castilian apprentices, Your Majesty. Not all of them are ready to forge new harnesses, but they can certainly mend old ones. We bring a dozen smiths with portable forges, anvils, tools. A man arrives with his grandfather's mail missing half its rings—by the time we march, it's whole again. His sallet has a crack? We replace the skull piece from stores and he keeps the rest.\"\n\n\nDiego is already calculating. \"Portable forges, coal, replacement parts, leather, rivets, tools... Perhaps three thousand florins to establish proper repair stations at Toledo. Another two thousand for similar stations at the major regional muster points—Burgos, Seville, Córdoba. Five thousand florins total for the repair program.\"\n\n\nHe sets down his pen and reviews the complete picture:\n\n\n\"The Full Equipment Program, Your Majesty:\"\n\n\n\"Milanese Order: Seven thousand quality infantry kits with Iota marks, emphasizing uniformity and craftsmanship. Approximately one hundred fifteen thousand florins including shipping and agent expenses.\"\n\n\n\"Domestic Production: Twenty-five hundred kits from Bilbao by autumn 1440. Already funded through existing subsidies.\"\n\n\n\"Self-Equipment Bonuses: Assuming seven to eight thousand men arrive with acceptable personal arms—five florins infantry, ten florins cavalry. Perhaps forty-five thousand florins.\"\n\n\n\"Repair Stations: Smiths, forges, and materials at muster points. Five thousand florins.\"\n\n\n\"Total Program Cost: Approximately one hundred sixty-five thousand florins.\"\n\n\nHe looks up. \"This leaves Crown stores with nine to ten thousand kits for issue, honors those who equip themselves, and improves the condition of personal equipment across the army. After the campaign, the Crown-issued armor returns to stores—an investment that serves future musters, not a gift that disperses into the countryside.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas adds: \"And the Iota mark serves triple purpose: it identifies Crown property, prevents illegal sale, and binds the men who wear it to something larger than themselves. They fight not merely for pay or plunder, but as the King's own equipped soldiers.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán speaks up. \"For the honor of self-equipped men—shall we formalize the title? Armiger Proprius has a ring to it, but perhaps something in Castilian would resonate more deeply. Hombre de Armas Propias—'Man of His Own Arms.' Or simply mark them in the muster rolls and announce their names at the Toledo assembly. Public recognition before twenty thousand men carries weight.\"\n\n\nDiego waits, pen poised. \"Shall I draft the formal terms for the Milanese agent, Your Majesty? And shall I coordinate with Master Steinmann regarding the repair station smiths? If we move quickly, the agent could depart for Milan within the fortnight.\""

They're asking about the number - 200 wagons.\n\nLet me think about what I know about Hussite war wagons:\n- The Hussites used wagenburg tactics successfully against multiple crusades\n- The wagons were reinforced with iron plates, had gun ports, could be chained together\n- They required specialized construction - not just ordinary farm carts\n- Hunyadi adapted these tactics for anti-Ottoman warfare\n\nI need to think about:\n1. How many wagons would be needed for the army Juan is raising (around 29,000 troops total across all territories)\n2. Cost of construction\n3. Timeline - they need to be ready by spring 1440 muster\n4. Where to build them\n5. How to transport them (they're heavy)\n6. Training requirements\n\nThe Hussites typically used one wagon per 15-20 soldiers, with crews of crossbowmen/handgunners inside. For a defensive formation, you'd want enough wagons to create a complete laager (circular or rectangular wagon fort).\n\nIf Juan is planning to bring maybe 10,000-15,000 Castilian infantry to the field battle, and using the Hussite ratio, he might need 500-1000 wagons for a full wagenburg. But 200 is what the user is suggesting - maybe as a starting point or for a smaller elite force?\n\nI should have Sir Thomas and Captain Fernán discuss the tactical requirements and what 200 wagons would actually provide versus what might be needed.\n\nAlso important: the wagons need to be transported to Constantinople or the Balkans. They're heavy. Can they be disassembled and shipped? Or built locally? This is a significant logistical challenge.\n\nLet me have the NPCs discuss this realistically.\n\n\nSir Thomas and Captain Fernán exchange glances at the number. It is Sir Thomas who speaks first, choosing his words with the care of a man who must balance honesty with respect.\n\n\n\"Two hundred wagons would give us a formation, Your Majesty. A starting point.\" He moves to the map table, pushing aside the Balkan charts to find clear space. \"The Hussites at their height fielded thousands of wagons—but they were defending Bohemia, not projecting force across the sea. Hunyadi works with smaller numbers, perhaps three to five hundred in a field army.\"\n\n\nHe picks up a candlestick and begins arranging objects on the table. \"The wagenburg doctrine uses roughly one wagon per eighteen to twenty men. The wagon carries supplies, ammunition, and serves as a fighting platform. In defense, the wagons chain together—\" he links his fingers \"—forming a fortress on the field. Crossbowmen and handgunners fire from behind the wagon boards while infantry defend the gaps.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán joins him at the table. \"For the field army Your Majesty described—twenty-nine thousand men joining the Poles and Hungarians—two hundred wagons protects perhaps four thousand soldiers. A strong core, but not the whole force.\"\n\n\n\"However,\" Sir Thomas interjects, \"we need not wagon the entire army. The wagenburg anchors the center. Infantry and artillery shelter within or behind it. Cavalry operates outside, striking when the enemy exhausts himself against the wagon wall.\" He arranges more objects. \"Two hundred wagons, formed in a rectangle with artillery at the corners... that creates a fortress perhaps two hundred yards by one hundred yards. Enough to anchor a battle line.\"\n\n\nHe straightens. \"For training purposes and for the tactics Your Majesty described—artillery and wagons working together—two hundred is sufficient. If we find we need more, the design can be replicated in Constantinople or purchased from Hunyadi's craftsmen in Hungary.\"\n\n\nDiego, who has been listening quietly, raises the practical question. \"Construction, Your Majesty. These are not farm carts. Each wagon requires:\"\n\n\nHe counts on his fingers. \"Heavy oak framing—stronger than a normal wagon to bear armored men and withstand charges. Iron reinforcement on the sides—plates or bands to stop arrows and deflect lances. Gun ports cut into the boards—hinged covers that open for firing. Chains and hooks for linking wagons together. Removable panels to create fighting gaps. And the wheels must be sturdier than standard, to bear the additional weight.\"\n\n\n\"A skilled cartwright can build an ordinary wagon in perhaps two weeks,\" he continues. \"These war wagons—a month each, perhaps longer for the first ones while the craftsmen learn the design. If we set twenty workshops to the task starting in December, working through winter...\"\n\n\nHe calculates. \"Twenty workshops, each producing one wagon per month, gives us perhaps eighty wagons by April. To reach two hundred by the muster, we'd need forty workshops—or accept delivery continuing through summer.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán adds: \"There's also transport to consider, Your Majesty. Two hundred heavy wagons cannot sail to Constantinople. They must either be disassembled, shipped as timber and iron, and rebuilt there—or we build them in the East from the start, using local craftsmen trained by Hunyadi's officers.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas nods. \"This argues for building perhaps fifty wagons here in Castile for training during the 1440 muster—enough to teach officers and men the formations. The remainder we construct at Constantinople over the winter of 1440-41, or contract with Hungarian craftsmen who already know the work.\"\n\n\nHe turns to you. \"If we're training men at every muster point with wagons present, fifty wagons distributed across five or six locations gives us eight to ten per site. Enough to demonstrate the formations, practice the drills, learn the chains and hooks. Then the veterans of that training supervise construction and crew assignment in the East.\"\n\n\nDiego has his pen ready. \"Fifty wagons for Castilian training, Your Majesty? Built this winter for spring muster? And the remainder constructed in Constantinople or Hungary? I can draft terms for the cartwrights—there are skilled men in Burgos, Valladolid, Toledo. The ironwork can come from Bilbao.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Cost for fifty reinforced war wagons—timber, iron, chains, specialized construction—perhaps thirty to forty florins each. Two thousand florins for the training fleet. The remainder depends on Eastern construction costs, which I cannot estimate without consulting someone familiar with Hungarian or Greek prices.\""

I now have a clearer picture of 15th century Spanish infantry. Let me synthesize what I've learned:\n\n1. Spanish infantry in the 1430s was traditionally seen as secondary to cavalry - \"peones\" (peasants) who only went to war if needed\n2. They were typically armed with spears, short swords, and crossbows\n3. Infantry \"played a poor part\" historically and were \"of no practical use\" in major battles like Navarette\n4. The main task of infantry was to serve as backup for cavalry\n5. Later (by 1497, after Ferdinand and Isabella), a Castilian ordinance divided infantry: 1/3 pikes, 1/3 swords and shields, 1/3 crossbowmen/gunners\n6. The tercio system wouldn't develop until after Gonzalo de Córdoba's reforms in 1495-1504\n\nSo in 1439, Castilian infantry would be relatively undeveloped compared to what would come later. They would be:\n- Spearmen with short spears (not pikes)\n- Crossbowmen\n- Sword and buckler men\n- Lightly armored (padded jacks, gambesons, perhaps mail for wealthier men)\n- Fighting in loose formations or as support for cavalry\n- Not trained in the pike squares or disciplined formations that Swiss or later tercio infantry would use\n\nThe academy, with its international faculty (including French infantry tactics from Captain Jean de Metz, and knowledge of Hussite/Hungarian tactics), would be trying to reform this into something more effective. Sir Thomas and the war council should explain this current state and what the academy proposes.\n\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont's expression shifts—this is his domain, and the question touches on both pride and frustration. He moves to the table, clearing a space.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the question that has occupied the Academy since its founding.\" He pauses, choosing his words. \"The honest answer is... Castilian infantry, as it exists today, is not meant to win battles. It is meant to not lose them while the cavalry does the real work.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán nods grimly. \"The peones—the foot soldiers—come from the towns and villages. They carry what they have: short spears, perhaps eight feet long. Swords. Bucklers. Crossbows for those who can afford them. Some wear gambesons or leather jacks. The wealthier men might have a mail shirt handed down from a grandfather.\"\n\n\n\"Their role,\" Sir Thomas continues, \"is to hold ground. They form a mass—not truly a formation, Your Majesty, but a mass—behind which cavalry can rally, or from which cavalry can charge. They defend camps. They garrison captured fortresses. They provide numbers.\" He shakes his head. \"At Alcalá la Real, at the Vega, in every major engagement of Your Majesty's Granada campaign, the infantry held position while cavalry won the battle. This works against the Moors, whose infantry is similarly pedestrian.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"Against the Ottomans, it will not work.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán elaborates: \"Ottoman Janissaries are professional infantry. Trained from boyhood. Disciplined. They fight in formations with handguns and bows, supported by artillery. They do not break. They do not flee. And behind them, the sipahi cavalry waits for our cavalry to exhaust itself against the Janissary wall—then they strike.\"\n\n\n\"The Academy has studied this,\" Sir Thomas says. \"Captain Jean de Metz brought French knowledge of infantry combat. Hunyadi's letters describe how he fights the Ottomans. The Swiss have shown what disciplined pike formations can accomplish against heavy cavalry. And now Your Majesty proposes to add war wagons and aggressive artillery.\"\n\n\nHe begins sketching on the table with his finger. \"What we propose is this: infantry that can hold. Not merely occupy space, but hold against cavalry charges, against Janissary volleys, against the pressure that breaks ordinary foot soldiers.\"\n\n\n\"First, the pike.\" He draws a long line. \"Not the short Castilian spear, but the Swiss pike—sixteen to eighteen feet. A forest of points that no horse will charge into. Men trained to stand shoulder to shoulder, to lower their pikes together, to trust that the man beside them will not flee.\"\n\n\n\"Second, crossbows and handguns.\" He adds marks behind the pike line. \"Ranged troops who can shoot from behind the pike wall, or from within the wagenburg. They break up enemy formations before contact.\"\n\n\n\"Third, sword-and-buckler men.\" He indicates flanking positions. \"For when the enemy closes past the pikes. Quick, aggressive fighters who can exploit gaps.\"\n\n\n\"The formation,\" he continues, \"would be something like this: pikemen in the center, dense and deep. Crossbowmen and gunners on the flanks or behind. Sword-and-buckler men ready to sally through gaps or defend breaches. The whole formation either anchored on the wagenburg or working alongside it.\"\n\n\nHe straightens. \"The Academy has trained officers who understand this doctrine. But the officers have never done it. And the men they will command have never trained in pike formations. They have never stood in a line and trusted strangers to hold beside them.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán adds quietly: \"This is why the 1440 muster matters so much, Your Majesty. If we can teach even a portion of the army to fight this way—to stand in formation, to respond to signals, to trust their officers—we create something Castile has never had: infantry that can face the Janissaries as equals.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas nods. \"The wagenburg gives them something to anchor on. The artillery gives them something the Ottomans cannot match. The doctrine gives them something to believe in. But none of it works without training. Drilling. Practicing until the movements become instinct.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"How much pike drill does Your Majesty wish to include in the muster exercises? And shall we begin acquiring pikes now? Eighteen-foot ash shafts are not common in Castile—we'll need thousands of them.\""

Let me think through what would make sense historically and tactically:\n\n1. Wagon crews - 400 wagons, each needs crew to man the gunports, defend gaps, handle chains. Probably 15-20 men per wagon for a defensive wagenburg. So that's 6,000-8,000 men assigned to wagon duty.\n\n2. Artillery crews - They mentioned 40-50 heavy guns, 15-20 field pieces. Each heavy gun needs maybe 8-15 men to operate, transport, protect. Field pieces maybe 6-10 men. So artillery crews could be 500-800 men.\n\n3. Pike infantry - The main infantry block. This should be a substantial portion.\n\n4. Crossbowmen/handgunners - Ranged troops behind the pikes or in the wagons.\n\n5. Sword and buckler men - For flanks and exploiting gaps.\n\n6. Cavalry - Both heavy (knights, men-at-arms) and light (jinetes). The cavalry should probably be a significant portion but not the majority, since infantry is the focus of this new doctrine.\n\nLet me think about historical army compositions:\n\n- A Castilian ordinance of 1497 (after this timeline but useful reference) divided infantry into: 1/3 pikes, 1/3 swords and shields, 1/3 crossbowmen and gunmen.\n\n- The Swiss typically fielded about 70-80% pikemen with the rest being halberdiers and crossbowmen.\n\n- For a balanced combined-arms force facing Ottomans, you'd want:\n  - Strong pike center\n  - Good ranged capacity (crossbows, some handguns)\n  - Cavalry for flanks and pursuit (but disciplined)\n  - Artillery superiority (which Juan has)\n  - Wagon crews\n\nLet me propose something:\n\n\nThe wagenburg itself accounts for roughly 7,200 men—18 per wagon across 400 units, mixing crossbowmen, handgunners, and polearm troops for defending the gaps. Artillery needs about 800 men total: 600 for the heavy guns at 15 men each, 200 for the lighter field pieces. That leaves roughly 21,000 men for the main field force.\n\nPike formations make up the backbone—around 9,000 men standing in deep blocks positioned behind or beside the wagons. Ranged troops (crossbowmen and handgunners) number perhaps 4,000-5,000, with some embedded in wagon crews and others in their own units. Sword and buckler men—maybe 2,000-3,000—handle close-quarters work and flank security. Cavalry splits between heavy mounted men-at-arms (2,000-3,000) and lighter jinetes (1,500-2,000), totaling 4,000-5,000 riders.\n\nAdding it up: 7,200 + 800 + 9,000 + 4,000 + 3,000 + 3,000 + 2,000 reaches the 29,000 figure, which tracks.\n\nRather than simply laying out these numbers, I should frame this as a discussion where Sir Thomas and Captain Fernán present the breakdown to the King and solicit his thoughts on whether these proportions make sense. The wagon garrison itself needs careful consideration—these aren't separate from the infantry count but rather a mix of crossbowmen, handgunners, and polearm fighters assigned to defend the 400 linked wagons. Each wagon requires a crew of ranged troops manning firing ports and close-combat men covering the gaps, with additional infantry sheltering inside. The distinction matters between dedicated wagon garrison troops and field infantry operating outside the wagenburg.\n\n\nSir Thomas and Captain Fernán exchange glances—this is the kind of detailed planning that separates a campaign from a disaster. Sir Thomas pulls a fresh sheet of parchment toward him and begins working through the numbers.\n\n\n\"Twenty-nine thousand men, Your Majesty. Let us build the army from the center outward.\"\n\n\nHe draws a rectangle. \"The Wagenburg—the anchor. Four hundred wagons, linked in a defensive formation. Each wagon needs men to shoot from the gunports, men to defend the gaps between wagons, and men to handle the chains and repairs under fire.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán interjects: \"The Hussites crewed each wagon with roughly fifteen to twenty men. Some with crossbows or handguns at the ports, some with polearms or swords to defend the gaps when cavalry tries to force through.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas nods. \"Call it eighteen men per wagon. Four hundred wagons times eighteen equals seven thousand two hundred men—all infantry, a mix of crossbowmen, handgunners, and close-combat fighters. These are the core, the men who hold the center while everything else pivots around them.\"\n\n\nHe writes the figure, then continues. \"Artillery crews. Your Majesty spoke of forty to fifty heavy guns and fifteen to twenty field pieces. Each heavy bombard needs twelve to fifteen men—loaders, aimers, powder handlers, protection. Field pieces perhaps eight to ten.\"\n\n\nDiego, who has been listening quietly, offers: \"Fifty heavy guns at fourteen men average—seven hundred. Twenty field pieces at nine men—one hundred eighty. Call it nine hundred artillerists, perhaps a thousand with reserves and replacements.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas marks this down. \"Pike infantry. The main battle line, formed behind or beside the wagenburg. Deep formations, eighteen-foot pikes, trained to hold against cavalry charges and Janissary pressure.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, calculating. \"For a proper pike square—or several squares—to anchor a battle line of this size, we need depth. Eight ranks minimum, ten or twelve preferred. A frontage of perhaps three hundred men per formation, three or four formations...\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán suggests: \"Eight to nine thousand pikemen would give us substantial blocks. Enough to extend the line beyond the wagenburg flanks, or to form reserve formations for counterattack.\"\n\n\n\"Crossbowmen and handgunners beyond the wagenburg.\" Sir Thomas continues. \"Ranged troops who operate in the open field, screening the flanks, providing volley fire. These are separate from the seven thousand in the wagons.\"\n\n\n\"Three to four thousand,\" Captain Fernán offers. \"Enough for significant flanking formations and to screen the pike blocks.\"\n\n\n\"Sword-and-buckler men.\" Sir Thomas draws flanking positions. \"The rodeleros—fast, aggressive fighters for when pikes are too slow. They exploit gaps, defend breaches, and can close with arquebusiers who trouble our formations.\"\n\n\n\"Perhaps two to three thousand,\" he says. \"Positioned on the flanks of the pike formations, or held in reserve.\"\n\n\n\"And finally, cavalry.\" He draws horsemen on both flanks. \"This is where Your Majesty's command about discipline becomes critical.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán speaks with feeling: \"The jinetes are trained from boyhood to chase. To harass, pursue, run down fleeing enemies. Against the Moors, this wins battles. Against the Ottomans...\" He shakes his head. \"The sipahis want us to chase. They feign retreat, draw our cavalry away from the infantry, then turn and cut them to pieces while their Janissaries assault our suddenly-unprotected foot.\"\n\n\n\"We need two types of cavalry,\" Sir Thomas says. \"Heavy cavalry—men-at-arms, knights—for the decisive charge when the enemy is already broken or disordered. They wait. They wait, Your Majesty, until the moment is right. Perhaps twenty-five hundred to three thousand.\"\n\n\n\"Light cavalry—jinetes—for scouting, screening, and controlled harassment. But trained, drilled, to break off on signal. To return to the army rather than pursue into ambush. Another two thousand, perhaps twenty-five hundred.\"\n\n\nHe tallies the figures:\n\nForce Component\nMen\nWagenburg crews (crossbow, handgun, polearm)\n7,200\nArtillery crews\n1,000\nPike infantry\n8,500\nCrossbowmen/handgunners (field)\n3,500\nSword-and-buckler (rodeleros)\n2,500\nHeavy cavalry\n2,800\nLight cavalry (jinetes)\n2,500\nCommand, signals, surgeons, support\n1,000\nTOTAL\n29,000\n\nSir Thomas sets down his pen. \"This gives us, Your Majesty:\"\n\n\n\"A defensive core of over eight thousand men in the wagenburg, supported by a thousand artillerists. No cavalry charge breaks that.\"\n\n\n\"A striking force of nearly nine thousand pikemen who can advance or hold as ordered.\"\n\n\n\"Six thousand ranged troops between the wagenburg and the field crossbowmen—enough to break any charge before it reaches our lines.\"\n\n\n\"And five thousand cavalry who, if properly disciplined, can decide the battle once the Ottomans have exhausted themselves against our guns and pikes.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán adds quietly: \"The cavalry discipline is the hardest part, Your Majesty. The muster exercises must include signal drills. Horns, flags, drums—and harsh punishment for any man who pursues without orders. Better to flog a dozen jinetes in training than lose a thousand in battle because they couldn't resist chasing a feigned retreat.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas nods. \"Shall I draft the training protocols for the 1440 muster based on these proportions, Your Majesty? And shall we include mock cavalry engagements where 'retreating' enemies are actually traps—to teach the men viscerally what happens when they break formation?\""

Tables detail every cost. Timelines establish every deadline. The army's structure—29,000 men in carefully balanced proportions—is laid out with precision.\n\n\nSir Thomas speaks quietly. \"It is ambitious, Your Majesty. More ambitious than anything Castile has attempted. But it is achievable. If the Milanese deliver, if the wagons are built, if the men train as we intend...\" He pauses. \"We will field an army unlike any the Ottomans have faced.\"\n\n\nDiego adds the financial assessment: \"Two hundred thirty-eight thousand florins. Seventeen percent of the treasury. The realm can bear it.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán, ever the practical soldier, offers the most important observation: \"The plan is sound on parchment, Your Majesty. Now comes the harder part—making it real.\"\n\n\nThe Ordo Belli Orientalis awaits your seal.\n\n\nFile: /mnt/user-data/outputs/Ordo_Belli_Orientalis_November_1439.docx"

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated political scene with dual announcements and noble consequences.\n\nThe player wants to summon the Cortes to make two major announcements:\n1. Álvaro de Luna's dismissal from political offices (though he's being protected by becoming the children's tutor)\n2. The muster plan for the Eastern Crusade\n\nThis is a significant political moment. Let me think about what this entails:\n\n1. Álvaro de Luna's dismissal - This has been building. The nobles have long hated Álvaro as a \"low-born upstart\" who wielded extraordinary power. Juan is dismissing him from political offices but protecting him by making him the children's tutor - a position of honor and safety. The nobles will likely be pleased that Álvaro is gone from power, but some may be suspicious about why he's being kept close.\n\n2. The muster plan - This is invoking noble obligation to raise 29,000 troops for the Eastern Crusade. This is a massive undertaking and will require the nobles to contribute significantly.\n\nI should narrate the summoning of the Cortes and the atmosphere, then present the scene where Juan will make his announcements. I need to stop and let the player actually speak/act rather than writing Juan's speech for him.\n\nLet me set the scene - the Cortes gathering, the nobles present, the atmosphere of anticipation. Then stop and wait for Juan to speak.\n\nI should also consider:\n- When would the Cortes meet? It's currently late November 1439. The Cortes would need to be summoned - messengers sent out, nobles traveling to Toledo. This would take a few weeks. So perhaps early-to-mid December 1439?\n- Who would be present? Major nobles, representatives of cities, clergy.\n- What's the mood? The nobles have been pressuring for Álvaro's removal. They'll be anticipating this. The muster announcement will be received with mixed feelings - glory and obligation.\n\nLet me write a scene-setting passage that brings the player to the moment of announcement, then stops for the player to speak.\n\n\nThe weeks pass in a flurry of preparation. Messengers ride to every corner of the realm bearing royal summons. By the second week of December, the great lords and city representatives have gathered in Toledo, filling the inns and noble townhouses, their retinues crowding the streets.\n\n\nThe rumors have preceded the summons. Everyone knows something is coming—the nobles who have long agitated against Álvaro de Luna sense victory; the administrators who have served under his direction fear what change may bring; the military men speak of the great muster to come. But no one knows exactly what the King will say.\n\n\n\nDecember 14th, 1439\n\n\nThe Great Hall of the Alcázar of Toledo\n\n\nThe hall is packed beyond comfort. Grandees occupy the front benches—the Counts of Alba, Benavente, Haro; the Marquis of Santillana; Don Fadrique Enríquez, Admiral of Castile. Behind them sit the lesser nobility, the hidalgos, the representatives of the chartered cities. Along the walls stand the Masters of the Military Orders: Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara. The Archbishop of Toledo occupies his traditional place near the throne.\n\n\nAnd in the shadows near the side entrance, Álvaro de Luna himself stands with quiet dignity. He knows what is coming—you have told him privately. His face betrays nothing, but his eyes are watchful, measuring the mood of the men who have sought his downfall for twenty years.\n\n\nThe hall falls silent as you take your seat upon the throne. The winter light through the high windows catches the dust motes stirred by hundreds of bodies. Somewhere, a cough echoes. A bench creaks.\n\n\nEvery eye turns to you."

      "say": "Men of Castille,\n\n\nI have gathered you here today to announce that come 1441, we will be at war with the Ottoman empire. A great conflict that we have entered into to fight for christianity and for justice. We know that we can win against the Moors, but we must fight even harder if we want to defeat the Ottomans.\n\n\nI have therefore started a muster every year in order for us to prepare for this conflict. Next years muster will be more important than ever before. We shall have to train to be able to stand up to the Janissaries and for that we have to be in one place. While last years musters have been optional, this years muster will not be. Every lord will assemble with his entire force and from that force I will select 29.000 who will come with me as we sail east towards Hungary.\n\n\nEquipment will be provided to those who lack and compensation and recognition will be given to those who come armed themselves. We will train to fight using pike formations and battle wagons. And our cavalry will be trained to fight as one.\n\n\nWhile nobles are obliged to fight with me in this most noble and holy effort, I shall remind everyone that participating in the fight will earn lands and titles using the muster system. The more and better men a noble contributes, the better lands and titles he shall recieve. We have seen this system work in Grenada, it shall work again in the east.\n\n\nAnd finally, there is one more thing. As our kingdom grew, the role advisors play becomes even more important. I have been advised by Alvaro who also held significant authority here at court. The new shape of the empire does no longer suit this arrangement. I have therefore decreed that Alvaro shall be released from his duties and shall retire. He has never betrayed me or the realm and it is time for him to step down.\n\n\nIn his place shall come a council of three who reflect the Cortes so that they may govern in my stead when I am away like a regency council does.\n\n\nThis Cortes shall elect one member of this council from their midst and be represented in this council.\n\n\nWe are the kingdom with the sun at our backs. We are the rising tide. We reclaim what is lost. We honour what is sacred. And we fight for what is right.\n\n\nDeus Vult!\n\n\nThis is a presuasion. Draft a d100 table using the skill."

War with the Ottoman Empire in 1441\n2. Mandatory muster for 1440 (not optional like previous years)\n3. Selection of 29,000 men for the eastern campaign\n4. Equipment provision and compensation system\n5. Álvaro de Luna's dismissal/retirement\n6. Creation of a three-person council to replace him, with one member elected by the Cortes\n\nThis is definitely a persuasion attempt. I need to use the persuasion skill to draft a d100 table. Let me read the persuasion skill document first.\n\n\nView: Reading the persuasion skill to properly construct the d100 table\n\n\nThought process: Weighed persuasion success factors against noble resistance and structural concessions.\n\nThis is a complex persuasion situation. Juan is addressing the full Cortes with multiple requests:\n\n1. Announcing war with the Ottomans in 1441\n2. Mandatory muster (not optional) - every lord must bring their entire force\n3. Selection of 29,000 men for the expedition\n4. Equipment provision and Hombres de Armas Propias system\n5. Álvaro de Luna's dismissal\n6. Creation of a three-person council with Cortes representation\n\nLet me think about who the audience is and what their reactions might be:\n\n**The Audience:**\n- Great nobles (grandees) - Counts of Alba, Benavente, Haro; Marquis of Santillana; Admiral Don Fadrique\n- Lesser nobility (hidalgos)\n- City representatives\n- Military Order Masters (Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara)\n- Archbishop of Toledo\n- And Álvaro de Luna himself, watching\n\n**Success Factors:**\n1. **Álvaro's removal** - Many nobles have wanted this for decades. This is a MAJOR concession that gives them what they've been fighting for.\n2. **Cortes representation on the council** - Unprecedented. The nobles and cities gain real power in governance.\n3. **The muster system rewards** - Proven in Granada. Nobles who fight well get lands and titles.\n4. **Equipment provision** - Crown paying to arm men reduces noble burden.\n5. **Hombres de Armas Propias** - Recognition and honor for those who invest in their own equipment.\n6. **Religious framing** - Crusade against the infidel is a cause most can support.\n7. **Juan's track record** - He conquered Granada. He delivered on promises before.\n8. **Juan's personal reputation** - He has been a successful king, popular with many.\n9. **The speech itself** - It's well-crafted, hits emotional notes, provides concrete benefits.\n\n\n10. **Compulsion carries risks** - Forcing nobles to muster rather than requesting volunteers creates resentment. Many will resist being commanded to send their best warriors across the Mediterranean to distant lands. The Ottomans have defeated crusades before, and nobles worry about defending their own territories while their forces are deployed elsewhere.\n\n11. **The council structure remains ambiguous** - Though the Cortes elects one member, Juan still selects the other two, preserving substantial royal control despite the appearance of shared governance.\n\n**Weighing the Concessions:**\n\nJuan's approach is strategically sound. He frames the campaign with religious urgency, acknowledges the Ottoman threat's severity, outlines the training and compensation structure, then delivers what the nobility most desires—Álvaro's removal and a voice in governance through the Cortes representative. These are significant concessions that address core grievances, though the mandatory nature of the muster and the distance of the campaign remain substantial obstacles to full support.\n\nThe speech functions as a calculated exchange: major political concessions in return for military commitment. Yet predicting the Cortes' collective response is more difficult than swaying individuals. Juan has structured his appeal carefully, layering incentives and ending with religious rhetoric, but the mandatory muster and years-long absence create genuine hesitation.\n\nThe removal of Álvaro and the council seat represent decades of noble demands finally met. Combined with Juan's proven success in Granada, the equipment provisions, and the presence of the Military Order Masters, these factors create momentum toward acceptance, though the risks remain real.\n\nThe Ottomans pose an actual threat, the commitment of 29,000 men is substantial, and some nobles will likely resist the compulsory nature of the muster or demand clarification on the council's actual authority. Reactions will range from enthusiastic support to grudging compliance with conditions, depending on individual interests and how much weight each noble places on the concessions versus the risks.\n\n\nNow let me carefully analyze this persuasion situation.\n\n\n\nPersuasion Analysis: Address to the Cortes\n\n\nStep 1: Identify the Ask\n\n\nJuan is asking the Cortes to accept a comprehensive package:\n\n\nMandatory muster (not voluntary) with every lord bringing their full force\n\nCommitment of 29,000 men for a distant campaign in the Balkans\n\nAcceptance of Álvaro de Luna's dismissal (framed as retirement, not disgrace)\n\nAcceptance of a new governing council with one Cortes-elected member\n\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the Approach\n\n\nStrengths of Juan's Speech:\n\n\nLeads with the religious cause and shared Christian purpose\n\nAcknowledges difficulty honestly (\"we must fight even harder\")\n\nProvides concrete benefits (equipment, compensation, recognition as Hombres de Armas Propias)\n\nReminds them of the proven Granada reward system\n\nDelivers Álvaro's removal—the thing anti-Luna nobles have wanted for twenty years\n\nOffers unprecedented Cortes representation on the governing council\n\nEnds with stirring, unifying rhetoric (Deus Vult!)\n\nFace-saving for Álvaro (\"never betrayed me or the realm\")\n\n\nWeaknesses of the Approach:\n\n\nMandatory muster announced as fait accompli, not negotiated\n\nDetails of the two other council members left vague\n\nThe campaign's distance and danger somewhat glossed over\n\nNo mention of what happens to estates while lords are away\n\n\nStep 3: Identify All Factors\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\n\nÁlvaro's removal — The anti-Luna faction has wanted this for two decades. This alone may secure significant goodwill. (MAJOR)\n\nCortes seat on the council — Unprecedented power-sharing. The nobles and cities gain real influence over governance. (MAJOR)\n\nProven reward system — Granada showed the muster system works. Nobles received lands and titles as promised.\n\nEquipment and recognition — Crown bears cost of arming the unequipped; honor given to self-armed men.\n\nJuan's track record — He conquered Granada, delivered on promises, and has been a successful king.\n\nReligious framing — Crusade against the infidel resonates with Christian nobility.\n\nMilitary Order Masters present — Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara have already committed. Social pressure to join.\n\nSpeech quality — Well-structured, emotionally resonant, hits the right notes.\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\n\nMandatory muster — Previous musters were voluntary. Compulsion chafes noble pride. Many will bristle at being told rather than asked. (SIGNIFICANT)\n\nDistant campaign — Hungary and the Balkans are far from Spain. Estates will be undefended. Families left behind. (SIGNIFICANT)\n\nOttoman danger — The Turks have crushed Christian armies before. This is genuinely risky. Men may not come home.\n\nScale of commitment — 29,000 men is enormous. Some lords may not want to send their best fighters so far.\n\nVague council details — The Cortes elects one member, but who are the other two? Royal appointments?\n\nLingering distrust — Some nobles may see Álvaro's removal as a tactical concession, not a genuine change in royal governance.\n\nLoss aversion — Committing men, money, and potentially lives to a war that doesn't directly threaten Castile.\n\n\nStep 4: Assess the Factor Balance\n\n\nThe two MAJOR success factors (Álvaro's removal + Cortes council seat) are enormous concessions that directly address what the nobility has been fighting for. Combined with Juan's proven track record and the religious cause, these create strong incentives to accept.\n\n\nHowever, the mandatory nature of the muster and the distant, dangerous campaign are genuine concerns. Nobles will accept—but the manner and enthusiasm of that acceptance varies significantly.\n\n\nOverall Assessment: Favorable but not guaranteed. The package is well-constructed, but compulsion and distant war create legitimate resistance.\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: Address to the Cortes\n\n\nContext: Juan addresses the full Cortes announcing mandatory muster, the Eastern crusade, Álvaro's dismissal, and a new governing council with Cortes representation.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nSerious Resistance. The announcement of mandatory muster lands badly. Several grandees rise to object—not to the crusade itself, but to being commanded rather than asked. The Count of Benavente demands to know who the other two council members will be before he commits anything. The city representatives exchange worried glances about the cost. Even those pleased about Álvaro's removal are disturbed by the tone. Juan has the authority to compel, but he has damaged relationships and created resentment that will complicate the muster.\n11-20\nGrudging Acceptance with Conditions. The Cortes accepts, but without enthusiasm. Multiple nobles voice concerns about the mandatory nature, the distance of the campaign, and the vagueness of the council structure. They want guarantees: who are the other two council members? What protections for estates while lords are away? What happens to families? The Álvaro announcement is received with satisfaction but does not generate the goodwill Juan hoped for—it feels like something they were owed, not a gift.\n21-35\nTepid Acceptance. The Cortes agrees to the muster, but the hall is subdued. The Álvaro announcement produces murmurs of approval, and the council seat is noted, but the mandatory muster and distant campaign cast a shadow. Nobles will comply, but many are clearly calculating costs rather than rallying to the cause. The Deus Vult at the end is echoed, but without fire.\n36-50\nAcceptance with Negotiation. The Cortes accepts the package, but voices rise with questions and conditions. Several nobles want clarification on the council structure. The city representatives ask about equipment distribution. The Military Order Masters affirm their support, which steadies the room. Overall positive, but Juan will need to address concerns in follow-up discussions.\n51-65\nSolid Acceptance. The Cortes receives the announcement well. The Álvaro dismissal produces visible relief among his enemies and dignified silence from his allies. The council seat is recognized as a genuine concession. The mandatory muster is accepted as the price of participating in a great enterprise. The Deus Vult is echoed with conviction. Some grumbling in corners, but the center holds.\n66-80\nStrong Acceptance. The combination of Álvaro's removal and Cortes representation lands powerfully. Nobles who have fought against Luna influence for decades see this as vindication. The crusade framing resonates—Spain has just completed the Reconquista; why not carry the war to the infidel's doorstep? Multiple lords rise to pledge their support. The Deus Vult rings through the hall.\n81-90\nEnthusiastic Rally. The Cortes erupts in approval. The Álvaro announcement is greeted with audible relief and even some applause. The council seat is hailed as evidence of Juan's wisdom. The crusade becomes a point of pride—Castile will lead Christendom against the Ottoman. Lords compete to pledge their support. The Military Order Masters lead the Deus Vult, and the hall thunders with it.\n91-100\nAcclamation. The Cortes rises as one. Twenty years of tension over Álvaro dissolve in a moment. The council seat transforms suspicion into partnership. The crusade becomes their cause, not just Juan's command. Spontaneous oaths of support ring out. The Count of Alba—longtime Luna enemy—rises and pledges his full strength to the muster. Others follow. The Deus Vult becomes a roar. Juan has united the realm.\n\n\nPersistent Failure Factors (appear in ALL outcomes):\n\n\nEven on the highest rolls, these elements persist:\n\n\nSome nobles will privately calculate costs and worry about the distant campaign\n\nQuestions about the other two council members will need to be addressed\n\nThe mandatory nature of the muster, while accepted, sets a precedent some find troubling\n\nÁlvaro de Luna, watching from the shadows, has allies who mourn his fall quietly\n\n\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty."

The Cortes receives the announcement well. Álvaro's dismissal produces visible relief among his enemies and dignified silence from his allies. The council seat is recognized as a genuine concession. The mandatory muster is accepted as the price of participating in a great enterprise. The Deus Vult is echoed with conviction. Some grumbling in corners, but the center holds.\n\nI need to bring this to life with specific NPCs reacting, the atmosphere in the hall, and the nuances of a \"solid acceptance\" - not enthusiastic, not grudging, but genuinely positive with some remaining concerns.\n\nI should NOT write Juan's dialogue or actions. I should stop after the Cortes has responded and any immediate NPC reactions, leaving space for Juan to respond or continue.\n\n\nThe hall absorbs your words in waves—first the announcement of war, then the mandatory muster, then Álvaro, then the council. You can see the calculations happening behind noble eyes, the quick glances exchanged between allies, the subtle shifts in posture.\n\n\nWhen you speak Álvaro's name, a ripple passes through the front benches. The Count of Benavente, silver-haired and long a thorn in Luna's side, sits straighter. The Marquis of Santillana's expression flickers—something between satisfaction and wariness. On the other side of the hall, men who owe their positions to Álvaro's patronage keep their faces carefully neutral.\n\n\nÁlvaro himself, standing in the shadows near the side entrance, inclines his head slightly. His face betrays nothing. Twenty years of power, ended with a sentence. He has never betrayed me or the realm. The words hang in the air—protection and dismissal woven together.\n\n\nThe announcement of the council seat produces a different kind of murmur. The city representatives lean toward each other, whispering. This is unprecedented. The Cortes has always advised; now it will govern, at least in part. Don Fadrique Enríquez, the Admiral, raises an eyebrow at the Count of Alba. Something unspoken passes between them.\n\n\nAnd then your final words ring out: Deus Vult!\n\n\nThe Military Order Masters respond first—Don Luis de Guzmán of Santiago, Don Pedro González de Padilla of Calatrava, Don Gutierre de Sotomayor of Alcántara. Their voices boom through the hall, trained by years of leading men in prayer and battle: \"Deus Vult!\"\n\n\nThe echo spreads. Not a roar, not yet—but solid, genuine. Nobles rise from their benches. \"Deus Vult!\" The city representatives join, some with conviction, others because the tide is moving and they will not be seen standing apart. \"Deus Vult!\"\n\n\nThe Count of Benavente rises, and the hall quiets slightly to hear if this old enemy of the crown will speak. He is looking at you with an expression difficult to read—grudging respect, perhaps, or the satisfaction of a man who has finally seen his rival fall.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, his voice carrying across the hall, \"the House of Benavente will answer the muster. We will bring our full strength, as commanded.\" The word commanded carries the faintest edge, but he continues: \"And we thank Your Majesty for the wisdom shown in... restructuring the governance of the realm.\"\n\n\nHe sits. It is not acclamation, but it is acceptance—and from Benavente, that is significant.\n\n\nOthers follow. The Count of Haro pledges his forces. The Marquis of Santillana, ever the poet-warrior, speaks of \"carrying the cross where the Moor once carried it against us.\" The Admiral confirms the fleet will be ready.\n\n\nBut there are questions too. Don Álvaro de Zúñiga, Count of Plasencia, rises with a careful expression. \"Your Majesty speaks of a council of three. The Cortes shall elect one. May we know who shall fill the other seats? And what powers this council shall hold in Your Majesty's absence?\"\n\n\nThe hall quiets again. This is the detail men have been waiting for—the shape of power while the King is a thousand miles away, fighting Turks in the Balkans.\n\n\nNear the back, among the lesser hidalgos, you catch fragments of quieter conversation: \"...twenty-nine thousand, he said. That's every fighting man in...\" and \"...my son, perhaps, but I cannot leave the estate undefended...\" and \"...the Turks destroyed Sigismund's army at Nicopolis, thirty thousand men...\"\n\n\nThe center holds. But the edges have questions."

This is a significant expansion of what he initially announced. Now he's opening the floor to questions.\n\nThis is a good moment to have the various estates respond with their questions and concerns. The roll of 53 indicated \"Solid Acceptance\" but with \"voices rise with questions and conditions\" and needs for \"follow-up discussions.\"\n\nI should have representatives from each estate speak up with their concerns. This isn't necessarily another persuasion roll - it's the natural follow-up to the announcement. The Cortes has accepted the general framework, but now they want details.\n\nKey questions that would arise:\n1. What powers does this council have? (Can they raise taxes? Command troops? Make treaties?)\n2. What happens if the three members disagree?\n3. How long do they serve?\n4. What about existing arrangements - the regency council structure, Álvaro's administrative apparatus?\n5. When does Juan depart and when is he expected to return?\n6. What about the estates while lords are away fighting?\n7. The clergy might ask about the Church's role - is this coordinated with the Pope?\n\nLet me have several NPCs speak - representing different concerns from different estates. I'll keep it realistic - they're accepting but want details and protections.\n\n\nThe clarification ripples through the hall. Three estates, three voices on the council. The nobles glance at each other—this means sharing power not just with the crown, but with burghers and clergy. The city representatives sit straighter, recognizing what has just been offered. The Archbishop of Toledo, who has been watching in contemplative silence, allows himself a small nod.\n\n\nA moment of shuffling, of whispered consultations, and then figures rise from each section of the hall.\n\n\n\nFor the Nobility\n\n\nThe Count of Alba rises first—Don Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, whose house has stood among the greatest in Castile for generations. His hair is grey now, his bearing still martial. He was never Álvaro's enemy, but neither was he his creature.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he begins, his voice measured, \"the nobility is honored by this trust. We have questions, as Your Majesty anticipated.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, organizing his thoughts.\n\n\n\"First: the council's authority. When Your Majesty sails east, what powers shall this council hold? May it raise taxes? Command the Crown Soldiers? Negotiate with foreign princes? Or does it merely administer what Your Majesty has already set in motion?\"\n\n\nHe glances briefly toward where Álvaro stands in shadow.\n\n\n\"Second: Don Álvaro has administered this realm for twenty years. His hands have touched every lever of governance. What becomes of the apparatus he built? The men he appointed? Do they serve the new council, or...?\" He leaves the question hanging.\n\n\n\"Third: the muster is mandatory, Your Majesty says. Every lord brings his full strength. But if we sail to Hungary with our fighting men, what defends our estates? What protects our families? The French watch our borders. The Moors across the strait remember Granada. Are we to leave Castile naked while we fight the Turk?\"\n\n\nHe remains standing, waiting.\n\n\n\nFor the Cities\n\n\nA burgher rises from among the city representatives—Don Pedro López de Ayala, procurador of Toledo, a man of commerce and law rather than war. His robes are fine but practical, marking wealth earned rather than inherited.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, with the careful diction of a man accustomed to contracts and negotiations, \"the cities are grateful for this voice on the council. It is... unprecedented.\"\n\n\nHe clears his throat.\n\n\n\"Our questions are practical. The muster will draw men from workshops and fields. The equipment program Your Majesty described—armor from Milan, weapons from Bilbao—who bears these costs? The Crown, you have said. But the transport of men, the provisioning of armies on the march, the disruption to trade while the realm prepares for war... these costs fall on the cities whether the Crown intends it or not.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to his fellow procuradores.\n\n\n\"We ask: what guarantees exist that the cities will not be bled dry to fund this noble enterprise? And—\" he hesitates, then presses on, \"—what happens if the campaign extends beyond one season? Two years? Three? How long must Castile sustain an army a thousand miles from home?\"\n\n\n\nFor the Clergy\n\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo rises last—Don Juan de Cerezuela, a man of learning and quiet ambition who has navigated the treacherous waters between crown and papacy for decades. His robes mark his office; his eyes mark his intelligence.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, his voice carrying the resonance of one accustomed to cathedrals, \"the Church blesses this holy endeavor. To carry the cross against the infidel is the highest calling of Christian arms.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, and his tone shifts slightly—still respectful, but probing.\n\n\n\"Yet we must ask: does His Holiness know of this undertaking? The crusade against Granada bore papal blessing and papal bull. Indulgences were granted. The spiritual architecture supported the temporal sword. What is the Church's role in this Eastern venture? Has Rome been consulted? Will there be a formal proclamation of crusade, with all the spiritual benefits that attend it?\"\n\n\nHe folds his hands.\n\n\n\"And regarding the council—the Church is honored to have a voice. But matters of faith are the Church's domain, not a council's. We must understand: will this body respect the ancient boundaries between temporal and spiritual authority? Or does Your Majesty envision... a broader mandate?\"\n\n\n\nThe three men stand, representing their estates, their questions hanging in the air of the great hall. Behind them, hundreds of faces wait for your answers. The shape of governance for the next years—perhaps the next generation—will be determined by what you say now."

They are to act in my name and have the authority to command crown soldiers, raise taxes, conduct diplomacy. But all under my direction. Members of the council are not rulers but rather the realm's highest servants. Servants of me and the realm. O set out the policy and direction, the council rules in my stead. Does the king have the power to raise taxes? Only after Cortes approval and the council thusly has the same power.\n\n\nThe men Don Alvaro has installed work for the realm, not him. But the council has the power to both fire and install new clerics or administrators. Again, if I find out that this council consioder their position as a means for personal empowerment, I will remove them immediately. The Cortes have long asked me to remove Alvaro. Now that I have, they have a chance to prove to me that this new arrangement is an improvement.\n\n\nWe sail with our best fighters east and away, but our homes are not defenseless. We have a powerfull navy to defend us from attacks overseas. And we will put the Moroccans in their place the coming year. If all goes well, we will have lands in Morocco and any agression against us will target these lands first. And we are surrounded by allies. The Portugese are our strong allies and Aragon is united and loyal to me. The French have enough on their plate and will not cross the Pyrennees. We are secure. And bandits or other upstarts will de dealt with by my peacekeeping force we keep at home.\n\n\nI turn to the burghers.\n\n\nI underestand your concerns where trade is concerned. This is I am afraid necessary. We all have our role to play in the coming conflict. The nobles will fight, and the cities will have disrupted trade. But the benefits are also around the corner. I have increased trade massively during my reign and after we have won, trade will continue to grow. The crown will pay for what I need of course and I am sure that together as a realm we can overcome this.\n\n\nI shall not increase taxes so I doubt the cities will be bled dry, but I also must be honest. This is a conflict of many years, not just one. Grenada was not won in one year and the coming war will take even longer.\n\n\nI turn to the clergy.\n\n\nThe pope has already granted me crusade to defend the eastern city of Constantinople. And I shall ask for a new crusade now that we are ready to take the fight to the Ottomans. The pope has already blessed our efforts and I am sure he will continue to do so.\n\n\nIn matters of faith, the council does not have more powers than I have and I trust that the division of temporal and spiritual matters shall remain divided.

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed persuasion strengths, weaknesses, and crafted d100 table framework.\n\nThe user has provided detailed responses to each of the three estates' questions. This is a follow-up persuasion attempt to address the concerns raised. Let me analyze this carefully using the persuasion skill.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Ask\n\nJuan is now asking the three estates to accept his explanations and move forward with:\n1. Accepting the council structure with full royal powers (but under Juan's direction)\n2. Trusting that existing administrators will serve the new council\n3. Accepting that Castile will be adequately defended while the army is away\n4. Accepting that trade disruption is a necessary sacrifice\n5. Accepting that this will be a multi-year commitment\n6. Trusting that papal blessing will be secured\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Approach\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Direct and honest answers to each concern\n- Clear explanation of council powers (they act in his name, with his authority)\n- Acknowledges that administrators work for the realm, not Álvaro personally\n- Points out concrete defensive measures (navy, Morocco campaign, allies)\n- Honest about the multi-year nature of the conflict\n- Confirms existing papal crusade blessing for Constantinople\n- Maintains boundary between temporal and spiritual authority\n- Challenges the nobles: \"prove to me this arrangement is an improvement\"\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- \"Servants of me and the realm\" may not fully satisfy nobles who want more independence\n- The Morocco campaign as a buffer is still hypothetical (hasn't happened yet)\n- Admits trade disruption is \"necessary\" without offering concrete compensation\n- \"I shall not increase taxes\" but also admits this is multi-year - how will it be funded?\n- Papal blessing is promised but not yet secured for this specific offensive campaign\n- The challenge to prove the arrangement works puts pressure on nobles\n\n### Step 3: Identify All Factors\n\n**SUCCESS FACTORS:**\n1. **Clear council authority** - Full royal powers are substantial. The estates know what they're getting.\n2. **Honest admission of multi-year commitment** - Transparency builds trust.\n\n\n3. **Defensive infrastructure in place** - The navy, Portuguese alliance, Aragonese support, and French preoccupation all provide real security layers. The Morocco campaign adds another buffer.\n4. **Existing papal framework** - There's already a crusade bull for Constantinople; this builds on established religious authority rather than starting fresh.\n5. **Tax restraint** - The promise of no new levies appeals directly to merchant and commoner interests.\n6. **Proven leadership** - Granada's conquest demonstrates Juan can deliver on ambitious military objectives.\n7. **Prior acceptance** - The Cortes already showed solid support (Roll 53), so this is reinforcement rather than initial persuasion.\n8. **Burden of proof shifted** - By asking the estates to demonstrate a better alternative, Juan puts them on the defensive.\n\nAgainst this, several vulnerabilities emerge. The \"servants of the realm\" framing may offend noble pride. The Morocco buffer remains theoretical—a promise without execution. Merchants got sympathy but no concrete compensation for trade losses. A multi-year campaign genuinely threatens noble estates and revenues. The papal blessing only covers defensive Constantinople action, not offensive crusading. Funding remains murky if the treasury alone must sustain years of war. Council oversight of administrators could destabilize existing power structures. And the implicit pressure on nobles to prove their loyalty might feel conditional rather than trusting.\n\nThe context matters here—this follows a successful initial pitch that already secured solid acceptance. Juan isn't winning them over from skepticism; he's addressing specific doubts after the foundation is set. The bar is lower. His answers provide useful clarity on council authority, confirm no new taxes, and establish papal involvement. But they're uneven in strength. Morocco stays hypothetical. Trade disruption gets acknowledged without remedy. The years-long commitment remains genuinely troubling. These are clarifications meant to resolve lingering concerns, not a fresh persuasion effort.\n\n\nPersuasion Analysis: Addressing the Three Estates' Concerns\n\n\nStep 1: Identify the Ask\n\n\nJuan is asking the three estates to accept his explanations and move forward without further objections regarding:\n\n\nCouncil authority structure (full royal powers, but as \"servants\")\n\nThe fate of Álvaro's administrative apparatus\n\nDefense of Castile while the army is abroad\n\nTrade disruption as a necessary sacrifice\n\nA multi-year commitment to the war\n\nPapal blessing for the offensive campaign\n\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the Approach\n\n\nStrengths:\n\n\nDirect, point-by-point responses to each estate's concerns\n\nClear articulation of council powers—substantial authority, clearly bounded\n\nHonest about the multi-year nature of the conflict (builds trust through transparency)\n\nConcrete defensive points: navy, Morocco campaign, Portuguese alliance, Aragonese loyalty, French preoccupation\n\nConfirms existing papal crusade blessing and commits to seeking expanded authorization\n\nExplicit preservation of temporal/spiritual boundary for the clergy\n\nChallenges the nobles constructively: \"prove to me this arrangement is an improvement\"\n\nNo new taxes promised—significant for the cities\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n\n\"Highest servants\" language may grate on noble pride\n\nMorocco buffer is hypothetical—the campaign hasn't happened yet\n\nTrade disruption acknowledged without concrete compensation or guarantees\n\n\"I shall not increase taxes\" combined with \"conflict of many years\" raises implicit funding questions\n\nPapal blessing for offensive crusade is promised but not yet secured\n\nThe challenge to nobles could be read as conditional trust rather than genuine partnership\n\n\nStep 3: Identify All Factors\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\n\nFoundation already laid — The initial announcement (Roll 53) achieved solid acceptance. This is clarification, not a new battle.\n\nClear council authority — Full royal powers are substantial. Each estate now knows exactly what they're gaining.\n\nTransparency about duration — Admitting this is multi-year, not one campaign, builds credibility through honesty.\n\nConcrete defense architecture — Navy, allies, Morocco buffer, peacekeeping forces—these are real answers, not vague reassurances.\n\nExisting papal blessing — The Constantinople crusade bull exists. Juan isn't starting from nothing.\n\nNo new taxes — The cities' greatest fear (being bled dry) is directly addressed.\n\nBoundary respect for clergy — The Church keeps its domain. Archbishop's concern is met.\n\nJuan's track record — Granada proved he delivers on promises. Administrative reforms have worked.\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\n\n\"Servants\" framing — Nobles are lords, not servants. The language may produce quiet resentment even if the substance is accepted. (MINOR)\n\nMorocco buffer is theoretical — \"If all goes well\" is not a guarantee. The campaign hasn't happened. (MODERATE)\n\nTrade disruption without compensation — Burghers asked for guarantees; they received sympathy and future promises. (MODERATE)\n\nMulti-year admission — Honest, but genuinely concerning. Estates undefended for years, not months.\n\nFunding question unanswered — No new taxes, but years of war. The treasury is substantial, but is it enough? Some will wonder.\n\nOffensive crusade blessing pending — Clergy asked directly; Juan says he'll request it. Not the same as having it.\n\nConditional challenge to nobles — \"Prove to me this is an improvement\" could be read as threat rather than opportunity.\n\n\nStep 4: Assess the Factor Balance\n\n\nThis is a follow-up clarification after an already-successful initial announcement. The fundamental acceptance has been given. The questions asked were legitimate concerns, not rejections. Juan's answers are substantive and mostly satisfactory, though some are stronger than others.\n\n\nThe nobles receive clear authority and a challenge they can rise to.\nThe burghers receive a no-new-taxes promise, though not the guarantees they sought.\nThe clergy receive boundary confirmation, though the papal blessing is pending rather than secured.\n\n\nOverall Assessment: Favorable. The initial acceptance provides momentum. The answers are reasonable. The main risk is that weaker answers (Morocco, trade, funding) may produce lingering doubt rather than active opposition.\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: Addressing the Estates' Concerns\n\n\nContext: Following solid initial acceptance (Roll 53), Juan addresses specific questions from nobility, burghers, and clergy regarding council powers, defense, trade disruption, and papal blessing.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nAnswers Backfire. The \"servants\" language lands poorly with the nobility—the Count of Alba's expression hardens visibly. The burghers exchange glances at \"necessary\" trade disruption without guarantees. The Archbishop notes that a promised papal blessing is not a secured one. What was solid acceptance begins to fray. Voices rise with follow-up questions that are really objections. Juan has not lost them, but he has lost momentum. The Cortes will accept, but grudgingly, and the elections for council members will be contentious.\n11-20\nPartial Satisfaction. The answers are received unevenly. The clergy seems satisfied—temporal and spiritual boundaries will hold. But the nobles are cool about being called servants, even of the realm. The burghers appreciate no new taxes but clearly wanted more concrete protection. The Count of Alba sits without further comment, which is not quite approval. The session will conclude with acceptance, but Juan has not fully won the room. Questions will resurface in private conversations.\n21-35\nAdequate but Uninspiring. Juan's answers are accepted as reasonable, but generate little enthusiasm. The Morocco buffer draws skeptical looks—it hasn't happened yet. The multi-year admission produces murmuring among the lesser nobles. The Archbishop nods at the boundary confirmation but his expression suggests he will be watching closely. The estates will proceed as directed, but without the energy the initial Deus Vult generated. Compliance, not conviction.\n36-50\nAcceptable Clarification. The three estate representatives receive Juan's answers with varying degrees of satisfaction. The Count of Alba accepts the council structure with a measured nod—the challenge to \"prove this arrangement is an improvement\" seems to land as intended. The burgher López de Ayala looks somewhat mollified by the no-new-taxes promise, though not entirely satisfied. The Archbishop accepts the papal blessing explanation. The Cortes is ready to proceed to elections.\n51-65\nSolid Resolution. Juan's answers address the core concerns effectively. The Count of Alba's slight tension eases—full royal powers for the council is substantial, and the challenge to prove the arrangement works appeals to noble pride rather than insulting it. The burghers accept that trade disruption is the cost of shared enterprise, particularly with taxes held steady. The Archbishop seems genuinely satisfied that spiritual boundaries will hold. The room settles into productive acceptance.\n66-80\nConcerns Resolved, Confidence Growing. The detailed answers transform lingering doubt into working trust. The Count of Alba rises again, briefly: \"The nobility accepts Your Majesty's explanation. We will elect our representative with care.\" The burgher López de Ayala acknowledges that shared sacrifice is the nature of great undertakings. The Archbishop offers a brief blessing on the endeavor. The estates are ready to move forward together.\n81-90\nStrong Satisfaction. Juan's directness and honesty win respect across all three estates. The Count of Alba appreciates being challenged rather than coddled—he is a man who respects strength. The burghers recognize that no new taxes, combined with Juan's economic track record, is the best they could expect. The Archbishop's concerns about papal blessing are met with the reminder that Juan has secured such things before. The room's energy shifts from cautious acceptance to genuine collaboration.\n91-100\nComplete Confidence. The answers land perfectly. The \"servants of the realm\" framing, rather than insulting noble pride, elevates the council position—they will be the realm's highest servants, sharing the King's own burden. The burghers hear the no-new-taxes promise and recognize that Juan has always dealt fairly with the cities. The Archbishop sees a king who respects ancient boundaries while pursuing holy war. When Juan finishes, the Count of Alba speaks for all three estates: \"Your Majesty has answered well. Let us proceed to elections.\" The Cortes is unified.\n\n\nPersistent Factors (present in ALL outcomes):\n\n\nEven on the highest rolls:\n\n\nThe Morocco buffer remains hypothetical until the campaign succeeds\n\nThe papal blessing for offensive operations must still be formally secured\n\nThe multi-year commitment will weigh on minds as the muster approaches\n\nSome burghers will privately calculate costs despite public acceptance\n\nThe transition from Álvaro's administration will require careful management regardless of stated policy\n\n\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty."

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated positive diplomatic outcomes across competing interests.\n\nThe player rolled 85, which falls in the \"Strong Satisfaction\" range (81-90). This is an excellent outcome - Juan's directness and honesty win respect across all three estates. The Count of Alba appreciates being challenged, the burghers recognize the no-new-taxes promise is reasonable given Juan's track record, and the Archbishop's concerns are met.\n\nI need to narrate this outcome, showing genuine satisfaction from all three estates while maintaining the persistent factors (Morocco is hypothetical, papal blessing needs securing, etc.). The tone should be positive but not over-the-top - this is strong acceptance, not acclamation.\n\nLet me write a scene where:\n1. Count of Alba responds positively to the challenge, showing noble pride responding to strength\n2. The burgher López de Ayala accepts the economic reasoning, trusting Juan's track record\n3. The Archbishop is satisfied about boundaries and acknowledges Juan's ability to secure papal support\n4. The room shifts toward genuine collaboration\n5. We move toward the council elections\n\n\nThe hall listens as you move through each concern, point by point. Your voice carries the confidence of a king who has thought through these matters—not defensive, not dismissive, but direct. You have given them real answers, not courtly evasions.\n\n\nThe Count of Alba's expression shifts as you speak of the council as \"the realm's highest servants.\" For a moment, his jaw tightens—servants—but then you add the challenge: prove to me this arrangement is an improvement. His eyes narrow, but not in anger. You have appealed to something in him. He is a man who has spent twenty years watching Álvaro accumulate power while the great houses stood aside. Now the King offers them that power—and dares them to wield it well.\n\n\nWhen you finish addressing the nobility, Alba inclines his head slowly. \"Your Majesty speaks plainly,\" he says. \"The nobility has long sought a voice in governance. Now we are offered not merely a voice, but responsibility. We accept both.\" He pauses, and something like a grim smile crosses his weathered face. \"We will prove this arrangement is an improvement. Your Majesty may count on it.\"\n\n\nThe Marquis of Santillana, beside him, murmurs agreement. Other nobles nod. The \"servants\" language has been transformed—not servants as menials, but servants as the King himself is a servant: bound by duty, elevated by burden.\n\n\n\nDon Pedro López de Ayala, the burgher of Toledo, listens to your acknowledgment of trade disruption with the expression of a man hearing hard truth. But when you speak of no new taxes, his posture eases. And when you remind them of the trade growth during your reign—the merchant who has seen his business flourish does not lightly doubt the king who made it so.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty has dealt fairly with the cities,\" López de Ayala says, and the words carry weight precisely because they are not flattery. \"We asked for guarantees. You offer instead your record—and a promise. The cities of Castile will accept this. We know that great undertakings require shared sacrifice.\" He glances at his fellow procuradores, who nod their assent. \"We trust that when the war is won, the cities will share in the victory as they share in the cost.\"\n\n\nIt is not the iron-clad guarantee they wanted. But it is enough, from a king who has earned their trust.\n\n\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo rises last, his robes settling around him with the gravity of his office. He has been watching you carefully throughout—not just your words, but your bearing. A prince who respects the Church is valuable; a prince who understands the Church is rare.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty confirms that spiritual matters remain in spiritual hands,\" he says. \"This is as it should be. The Church has no desire to govern tax rolls and command soldiers; nor should the council adjudicate matters of doctrine and salvation.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, considering his next words.\n\n\n\"You say His Holiness has already blessed the defense of Constantinople, and that you will seek formal proclamation of crusade for the offensive campaign. I have observed Your Majesty's dealings with Rome over many years. When you sought papal blessing for the Granada crusade, you secured it. When you sought recognition of your titles, you secured it. The Church has confidence that you will secure this blessing as well.\"\n\n\nHis tone warms slightly—as much as an Archbishop's tone ever warms.\n\n\n\"The clergy will elect a representative to this council. We will choose wisely, as befits the gravity of the charge. And we will pray for the success of Christian arms against the infidel. Deus vult.\"\n\n\nThe last words are not a shout but a benediction—the Church's seal upon the enterprise.\n\n\n\nThe hall's atmosphere has shifted. What began as questions and concerns has become something else: genuine collaboration. The three estates have tested the arrangement and found it sound. They have challenged the King and been challenged in return. Honor has been satisfied all around.\n\n\nThe Count of Benavente, who spoke earlier with that faint edge in his voice, rises again. This time his tone is different—still proud, but no longer guarded.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty has answered the questions of the estates. Let us proceed to the business at hand. The council must be elected, and there is much to do before the muster.\" He looks around the hall. \"I propose the estates withdraw to select their representatives. We should reconvene before evening with names to present to His Majesty.\"\n\n\nMurmurs of agreement ripple through the benches. The machinery of governance begins to turn.\n\n\n\nAs the hall stirs with movement—nobles clustering to confer, burghers gathering their procuradores, clergy drifting toward the Archbishop—you catch a glimpse of Álvaro de Luna near the side entrance. He has watched the entire proceeding in silence.\n\n\nFor a moment, your eyes meet. Twenty years of partnership, of shared victories and weathered crises, of a bond that began when you were barely more than a boy and he was the only man at court you could trust.\n\n\nHe inclines his head—a gesture of respect, of farewell, of something that might be gratitude. Then he turns and slips through the door, leaving the hall where he once held more power than any man save the King himself.\n\n\nThe door closes quietly behind him.\n\n\n\nThe estates will need several hours to deliberate. The nobility must choose among proud houses, each with their own candidates. The burghers must balance the great cities—Toledo, Burgos, Seville, Valladolid—against each other. The clergy must navigate between the Archbishop's preferences and the interests of the broader Church.\n\n\nBy evening, you will have your council.\n\n\nWhat does Your Majesty do while the estates deliberate?"

Juan has just publicly announced Álvaro's \"retirement\" from his political duties, but now he's asking Álvaro about \"the greatest task of your life\" - which suggests Juan has something else planned for him.\n\nFrom the chapter summaries and character database, I know that:\n- Álvaro has been Juan's closest advisor for 20 years\n- He was deeply hated by many nobles as a \"low-born upstart\"\n- He's absolutely loyal to Juan\n- In Chapter 2.58, Juan announced that Álvaro would become the children's new teacher and mentor following his retirement from political offices\n- Princess Catalina (age 7) deduced the political implications - nobles forced Álvaro out, Juan is protecting him\n\nSo the \"greatest task\" is likely referring to educating and mentoring the royal children - particularly Prince Fernando, the heir. This is actually a position of tremendous trust and long-term influence, even if it lacks the immediate political power Álvaro held.\n\nI need to write Álvaro's response. He's a brilliant political strategist who would understand exactly what Juan is doing - protecting him from his enemies while giving him a role that may ultimately be more important than his previous one: shaping the next generation of rulers.\n\nLet me write this scene with appropriate emotional weight. Álvaro has just watched his public career end, but Juan is now revealing the deeper plan. This should be a powerful moment between two men who have been through everything together.\n\n\nThe private chamber is quiet after the tumult of the great hall. A fire crackles in the hearth, casting warm light across the familiar furnishings—the maps, the books, the worn chairs where you and Álvaro have sat through countless late nights planning campaigns, navigating crises, building the kingdom that now stretches from the Atlantic to the gates of Constantinople.\n\n\nÁlvaro enters without ceremony. He looks older than he did this morning, though perhaps that is only the light. Twenty years of carrying the realm's burdens show in the lines of his face, the grey at his temples, the careful way he moves—a man who has learned that every room may contain enemies.\n\n\nBut his eyes, when they meet yours, are clear. He has always understood you better than anyone.\n\n\nHe closes the door and stands for a moment, taking in the question. The greatest task of your life.\n\n\nA faint smile crosses his weathered face—not bitter, but wry. The smile of a man who has learned to appreciate irony.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says slowly, \"I have just been dismissed before the assembled nobility of Castile. My enemies are even now congratulating each other in the halls. The Count of Benavente is likely composing verses to celebrate my downfall.\" He pauses. \"And you speak of the greatest task of my life.\"\n\n\nHe moves to the chair across from you—the chair he has occupied a thousand times—and lowers himself into it with the ease of long habit. For a moment, neither of you speaks. The fire pops and settles.\n\n\n\"The children,\" Álvaro says. It is not a question.\n\n\nHe looks into the flames, his expression thoughtful.\n\n\n\"I confess, when you first told me of this plan, I thought it a kindness. A soft landing for an old servant. A way to keep me close while satisfying those who have howled for my removal since before Fernando was born.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"But I have had time to think on it. And I begin to understand what you are actually asking.\"\n\n\nHis gaze returns to you, sharp and assessing—the gaze of the man who outmaneuvered the Infantes, who held Valladolid when the realm trembled, who built the administrative machinery that made your conquests possible.\n\n\n\"Fernando will be king. Perhaps the greatest king Castile has ever known, if he is shaped well. And Catalina—\" A flicker of something like admiration crosses his face. \"That girl already sees more than half the lords in your Cortes. She knew what my dismissal meant before I had finished hearing the words.\"\n\n\nHe is silent for a long moment.\n\n\n\"You are asking me to build the next generation. Not to govern the realm for the years you are away—any competent council can do that. But to forge the minds that will govern for the next fifty years. To teach Fernando what it means to be a king who is loved rather than feared. To sharpen Catalina's gifts until she becomes... whatever she is meant to become.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro leans back in his chair, and for the first time since entering, the tension in his shoulders eases.\n\n\n\"My enemies think they have won. They think I will fade into comfortable obscurity, tending gardens and writing memoirs.\" The wry smile returns. \"Let them think it. In twenty years, when Fernando sits on the throne and Catalina advises him, when every lesson I teach them bears fruit in wise rule and sound judgment—then we shall see who truly won.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. I am ready. I have governed your realm for twenty years. Now I will help you build the rulers who come after.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, and something softer enters his voice—something rarely heard from the man the nobles call cold and calculating.\n\n\n\"And I am grateful. You could have cast me aside entirely. You could have let my enemies have their full victory. Instead, you give me this.\" He gestures vaguely, encompassing the future. \"The chance to matter, long after the counts and marquises have forgotten why they hated me.\"\n\n\nThe fire crackles. Outside, faintly, you can hear the murmur of the deliberating estates.\n\n\n\"What would you have me teach them first?\""

And dangerous, as you say.\"\n\n\nHe rises and moves to the window, looking out over the courtyard where, hours ago, you gathered your children around you.\n\n\n\"A king who wants to be loved will hesitate to punish. He will seek compromise when strength is required. He will trust men who flatter him and doubt men who tell him hard truths. He will mistake popularity for loyalty—and learn the difference only when it is too late.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro turns back to face you.\n\n\n\"But a king who wants to be feared—\" He shakes his head. \"That is no better. I have watched such men. They see enemies everywhere. They crush dissent until no one dares speak truth to them. They rule over silence and call it peace. And when they fall, no one mourns.\"\n\n\nHe returns to his chair, settling into it with the deliberate movements of a man marshaling his thoughts.\n\n\n\"The art is to be respected. To be the king men follow because they trust his judgment, not because they fear his wrath or crave his smile. Fernando must learn that love freely given is precious—but love purchased by weakness is worthless. He must learn to be kind without being soft. To listen without being swayed. To punish when necessary and forgive when wise.\"\n\n\nA dry laugh escapes him.\n\n\n\"This is, of course, impossibly difficult. Most men never learn it. But Fernando has something most princes lack—he genuinely cares about others. That is the foundation. We must build walls around it so it does not destroy him, but we must not smother it entirely. A king who truly cares for his people, and who has learned to channel that care through strength and wisdom...\" He trails off. \"Such a king could be extraordinary.\"\n\n\nHe shifts, turning to the other matter.\n\n\n\"Reading people.\" Álvaro's eyes sharpen. \"Yes. This is where I can be of use. I have survived twenty years as the most hated man in Castile by understanding exactly this—what is said, what is not said, and what men mean but dare not speak.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\n\"It begins with observation. Children are natural observers, but they do not know what to look for. I will teach them to watch eyes when words are spoken—does the gaze hold steady or drift away? To notice hands—do they clench, fidget, reach for comfort? To hear the pause before an answer—is it thought, or is it fabrication?\"\n\n\n\"But observation is only the first layer,\" he continues. \"The deeper skill is understanding why men conceal. What do they fear? What do they want? What would shame them if it were known? Every man in your Cortes today had a public position and a private interest. The Count of Alba spoke of the council's authority—but what he truly wanted to know was whether his house would have a path to that council seat. The burgher López de Ayala asked about trade—but his real fear was that the other cities might profit while Toledo sacrificed.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"I will teach them to ask: What does this person need from me? What do they fear I might do? What would they ask for if they were not afraid to ask? Once you understand these things, the words men speak become... transparent. You hear the meaning beneath the meaning.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, a thoughtful expression crossing his face.\n\n\n\"Catalina already has instincts for this. When you announced my dismissal, she understood immediately—not just what had happened, but why. She saw the political calculation. At seven years old.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"With her, the task is different. She must learn to conceal her perception. A woman who sees too clearly, and shows that she sees, becomes threatening. Men will fear her. She must learn to see everything and reveal only what serves her purpose.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\n\"Do you want me to teach them together, or separately? There is value in both. Together, they learn to work as partners—to share observations, to cover each other's blind spots. Separately, each can be taught according to their nature without the other's presence shaping their responses.\""
