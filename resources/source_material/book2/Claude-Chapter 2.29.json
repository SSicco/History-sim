Low rolls mean hard bargaining, not irrational hostility. Committed allies defend their own stake. Before NPC dialogue: What do they want? What won't they say? What have they seen? GM: Remember to never generate dialogue or action for Juan. Instead, just stop.  Read kingdom guide.md Read NPC guide.md\nProvide a short introduction about the situation. Dont advance the timeline."

Now let me read the CHARACTER_DATABASE.md from the user's computer.\n\n\nTool: read_text_file\n\n\nThought process: Reconciling character database inconsistencies with recent chapter timeline.\n\nThis is extremely comprehensive. Now let me also read the Kingdom of Castile guide and then I can provide an introduction to Chapter 2.29.\n\nLet me also check Chapter 2.28 summary again for the exact current timeline and situation. Based on what I've read:\n\nCurrent Date: Early 1435 (after Juan returned to Toledo from Naples)\nKey recent events from Chapter 2.28:\n- Bianca born September 14, 1434 in Naples\n- Juan returned to Toledo with family late 1434/early 1435\n- Meeting with Sultan Murad II scheduled for Spring 1435 at Tenedos\n- Major council session reorganized finances\n- Naval reserve of 200,000 florins established\n- Infrastructure program of 40,000 florins/year for 5 years launched\n- Junta de Manufacturas established\n- Admiral needed from Alfonso V\n\nWait, the CHARACTER_DATABASE.md says it was last updated November 12, 2025 for Chapters 43 and 44, but Chapter 2.28 summary talks about events in 1434-1435 timeline. Let me re-read the Chapter 2.28 summary more carefully.\n\nLooking at Chapter 2.28 Summary:\n- July 1434: Army disbanded, Juan awaits in Naples\n- Late July 1434: Ottoman diplomatic contact\n- September 14, 1434: Bianca born in Naples\n- November 1434: Departure from Naples\n- Early 1435: Arrival in Toledo, reunion with Fernando\n- Early 1435: Major council session, financial reorganization\n\nThe CHARACTER_DATABASE seems to be stuck at April 1433 (Te Deum ceremony) timeframe, but Chapter 2.28 is clearly in 1434-1435. This seems like the CHARACTER_DATABASE hasn't been updated for the most recent chapters.\n\nLet me also note:\n- Queen Lucia d'Este is now Juan's wife (Isabel died at some point after giving birth to Fernando, perhaps in childbirth with Fernando or shortly after)\n\n\n- Children: Catalina (nearly 3), Fernando (14 months), Bianca (newborn in Sept 1434)\n\nI'm tracking the family's progression carefully. Isabel's death occurred between April 1433 and late 1434, with Lucia d'Este now serving as Juan's wife. The children's ages and birth order are clear: Catalina is the eldest at nearly 3, Fernando is 14 months old, and Bianca is the newest addition, born in September 1434 in Naples.\n\nLucia has seamlessly integrated into the family, becoming a maternal figure to Juan's children. Catalina now calls her \"mama\" and has no memory of Queen Isabel. A painting of Isabel remains in Toledo, serving as a future conversation piece when Juan decides to explain her history to Catalina.\n\nThe family is settled in Toledo, with Juan managing complex diplomatic and military strategies, including preparations for the meeting with Sultan Murad II and ongoing naval expansion efforts.\n\n\nView: Reading the Kingdom of Castile guide for current strategic context\n\n\nThought process: Reconciled timeline discrepancies and assembled contextual framework for chapter.\n\nNow I have a good picture. But I notice the Kingdom guide is dated June 1433, while Chapter 2.28 ends in Early 1435. Let me check the actual finances spreadsheet to see if it's been updated for 1434, and then I can provide an accurate introduction.\n\nBased on Chapter 2.28 Summary, the current situation is:\n- Date: Early 1435 (after Toledo council session)\n- Treasury: 545,987 florins (345,987 available after 200,000 naval reserve)\n- Meeting with Sultan Murad II scheduled for Spring 1435 at Tenedos\n- Juan is with family in Toledo (Lucia, Fernando, Catalina, Bianca)\n- Constantinople has 1,000 Military Order soldiers and settlement campaign showing extraordinary results\n- Admiral appointment pending from Alfonso V\n- Various programs launched (infrastructure, Junta de Manufacturas, etc.)\n\nLet me now view the 1434 finances file to understand the current financial situation.\n\n\nView: Reading the 1434 finances spreadsheet to understand current financial situation\n\n\nThought process: Reconstructed historical context and identified pending narrative threads.\n\nThe Excel file is showing as binary content, which isn't readable. Let me use bash to extract and read the contents properly using the computer environment. But first, let me just provide the introduction based on what I know from the Chapter 2.28 summary and other files. The key details are clear:\n\nCurrent situation at the end of Chapter 2.28 / start of Chapter 2.29:\n- **Date:** Early 1435\n- **Location:** Toledo, Castile\n- **Juan's family:** Queen Lucia d'Este, Prince Fernando (14 months - heir), Princess Catalina (nearly 3), Princess Bianca (newborn)\n- **Queen Isabel:** Deceased (died between April 1433 and 1434, likely in childbirth with Fernando)\n- **Treasury:** 545,987 florins total (345,987 available after 200,000 naval reserve)\n\n**Key upcoming matters:**\n1. Meeting with Sultan Murad II scheduled for Spring 1435 at Tenedos\n2. Admiral appointment needed from Alfonso V\n3. Military Orders Charter for new Eastern mission\n4. Junta de Manufacturas - foreign experts being summoned\n5. Infrastructure program underway\n6. Settlement campaign in Constantinople showing extraordinary results (Roll: 99)\n7. Commander Martín's Morocco mission (roll: 71 - moderate success, to be revealed Oct/Nov 1433... wait, that timeline doesn't match)\n\nActually, I think there might be some confusion with the timeline. Let me re-read Chapter 2.28 summary more carefully...\n\nFrom Chapter 2.28:\n- Commander Martín's Morocco mission was rolled at 71 (moderate success), but that mission departed April 5, 1433 and results expected October/November 1433\n- The current chapter timeline is July 1434 - Early 1435\n\nSo by Early 1435, the Morocco mission results should have already come in. This is an outstanding matter that may need to be addressed.\n\n\nNow I have the full picture. Let me provide the introduction to Chapter 2.29.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2.29: The Crossroads\n\n\nEarly 1435 — Toledo\n\n\n\nThe winter fires crackle in the royal apartments as Juan II settles into the first peaceful months he has known in years. Toledo's ancient stones embrace a household transformed: Queen Lucia nursing the infant Bianca, Prince Fernando toddling through the corridors on unsteady legs, and Princess Catalina—nearly three now—already declaring herself the guardian of her younger siblings.\n\n\nThe kingdom rests easier than it has in living memory. The treasury stands at 545,987 florins (with 345,987 available after the 200,000 florin naval reserve), fed by revenues that have more than doubled since Juan's accession. Diego de Daza's reforms continue their methodical expansion. The Council of Great Houses polices noble compliance. Granada settles into Christian governance without major incident.\n\n\nAcross the Mediterranean, extraordinary news filters back from Constantinople. The settlement campaign—seeded with Juan's commitments—has exceeded all expectations. Over five thousand new settlers are expected by 1436, the walls stand stronger than they have in generations, and the Military Orders have established permanent commanderies in the ancient city. The empire breathes again.\n\n\nYet several matters await resolution:\n\n\nThe Tenedos Meeting — In mere weeks, Juan must sail to meet Sultan Murad II on neutral Venetian ground. Fifty guards each. Equal terms. The Ottoman ruler who has spent years watching this Castilian king transform the strategic landscape of both Iberia and the Eastern Mediterranean. What does Juan want from this meeting? What does the Sultan?\n\n\nCommander Martín's Return — The Morocco mission departed April 1433. By now, results should have arrived. The converted commander and his delegation were tasked with establishing intelligence networks and testing the possibility of Mediterranean cooperation.\n\n\nThe Admiral Question — Alfonso V was to send an experienced naval officer to build Castile's maritime capabilities. Has that appointment materialized?\n\n\nThe Military Orders' Eastern Charter — The new mission binding the Orders to the Apokatastasis remains to be formalized.\n\n\nThe Junta de Manufacturas — Foreign experts have been summoned throughout 1434. What proposals have emerged?\n\n\nThe morning light catches the frost on Toledo's battlements. Somewhere in the palace, Catalina's voice carries through the corridors, explaining castles to a baby who cannot yet understand.\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

      "say": "Thought process: Recalibrated timeline to late summer 1434, corrected premature advancement.\n\nThe user is correcting me. They said not to advance the timeline, and I jumped ahead to early 1435. The actual situation is that we just finished the budget session for 1434 - this would be the council meeting in early 1435 where they reviewed the 1434 finances and made decisions for the coming year.\n\nWait, let me re-read Chapter 2.28 summary more carefully...\n\nFrom the Chapter 2.28 summary:\n- July 1434: Army disbanded; Juan awaits in Naples\n- Late July 1434: Hamza Bey arrives; Tenedos meeting arranged for Spring 1435\n- September 14, 1434: Bianca born in Naples\n- November 1434: Departure from Naples\n- Late 1434/Early 1435: Journey to Toledo\n- Early 1435: Arrival in Toledo; reunion with Fernando\n- Early 1435: Major council session; financial reorganization\n\nSo the timeline in Chapter 2.28 does reach \"Early 1435\" with the major council session. But the user is saying that's wrong - we should still be in late summer 1434 or something, right after Diego finished the budget.\n\nActually wait - the user says \"I just finished the budget for 1434. But that does not mean that the actual date is januari 1435.\"\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. If Diego is presenting the budget FOR 1434, when would that happen? Typically budgets are done at the start of a year or reviewed at the end. The Chapter 2.28 summary says:\n\n\"Early 1435: Major council session; financial reorganization\"\n\nBut the user is saying we shouldn't advance to 1435 - we're still in the moment right after the budget was drafted. Looking at the timeline in Chapter 2.28:\n\nThe chapter covers July 1434 through Early 1435, ending with the council session. But the user wants to stay at the moment Diego finished drafting the budget - which could be during the Naples stay or the Toledo council.\n \nI need to reset the timeline and stay in late summer 1434. We're in Naples, with the army recently disbanded and Lucia pregnant. The budget for 1434 has just been completed, and we're in a moment of transition before the next major events unfold.\n\nDiego has drafted the financial plans, capturing the complex economic landscape after the military campaign. The context is critical - we're between significant moments, with Hamza Bey's mission already completed and the Tenedos meeting still months away in Spring 1435.\n\nThe setting is precise: late summer in Naples, with the potential for strategic financial discussions and personal dynamics emerging as Lucia approaches her pregnancy and Diego processes the recent military and diplomatic developments.\n\nI'll need to carefully map the financial context, considering the disbanded army, pending diplomatic responses, and the impending transition toward the Toledo council's more formal financial reorganization.\n\nI'll draft an introduction that captures the budget discussion's nuanced timing, positioning Diego's work within the late summer 1434 Naples context while maintaining narrative precision.\n\n\nYou're absolutely right—my apologies for jumping ahead. Let me reset properly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2.29: The Reckoning\n\n\nLate Summer 1434 — Naples\n\n\n\nThe afternoon heat hangs heavy over the Palazzo Caracciolo as Diego de Daza sets down his quill, the final figures of the 1434 budget now committed to parchment. Through the open windows, the sounds of Naples drift upward—merchants, sailors, the eternal commerce of a great port city now firmly under Aragonese rule.\n\n\nJuan sits across from his chief financial administrator, the columns of numbers spread between them. The picture they paint is remarkable: a treasury of 545,987 florins, revenues that have more than doubled since his accession, a kingdom transformed from fractured weakness to fiscal strength.\n\n\nQueen Lucia rests in the adjoining chambers, her pregnancy advancing toward its final weeks. The child is expected in September. Catalina—not quite three—plays somewhere in the palazzo under the watchful eyes of her nurses, still learning what it means to have a father present.\n\n\nOutside these walls, the pieces of Juan's grand strategy continue to move:\n\n\nHamza Bey departed weeks ago, carrying word to Sultan Murad II. The meeting at Tenedos is arranged for Spring 1435—equal guards, neutral ground, two rulers taking each other's measure.\n\nCommander Martín de Alcalá leads the Morocco delegation somewhere across the strait, building the intelligence networks and relationships that will take years to mature.\n\nThe Military Orders have committed their knights to Constantinople, the settlement campaign underway, though results remain months from assessment.\n\nKing Alfonso V consolidates his hold on Naples, the Aragonese crown now master of both Sicily and the Italian kingdom.\n\n\nDiego looks up from the documents, awaiting the king's response to the financial picture he has assembled.\n\n\n\nThe budget lies complete. What does Juan wish to address?"

These are marked for immediate expansion.\n4. Summon a large delegation of Dominicans - the user mentions meeting a Dominican on their travels\n\nLet me set up these scenes. I should not advance the timeline significantly, just have Juan give these orders and perhaps start the conversations.\n\nI need to be careful not to generate dialogue or actions for Juan - I should set up the NPCs and let them speak, then stop for Juan to respond.\n\nLet me think about who would be present:\n- Diego de Daza (just finished the budget)\n- Possibly Alfonso V could be summoned or a message sent\n- The Dominican delegation would need to be summoned\n\nI should have Juan give the orders through dialogue he initiates, but since I can't write Juan's dialogue, I need to present the situation and let the player state what Juan says/does.\n\nActually, the player has told me what Juan wants to do. I can narrate the process of these orders being given and the responses, but I should stop when NPCs need responses from Juan.\n\nLet me write this out:\n1. Diego can take note of the orders\n2.

The Cordoban leather guild maintains factors here in Naples for the Italian trade; one could appear within days.

I can send word to the provincial chapter—there is a priory here in Naples, and the provincial headquarters at Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome is not far by sea.\" He hesitates, clearly wondering at the purpose but knowing better than to ask directly. \"How large a delegation does Your Majesty require? And shall I indicate any... particular expertise you seek among them? Theologians? Preachers? Those experienced in... other matters?\"\n\n\nThe administrator's pen hovers, awaiting clarification.\n\n\n\nDiego waits for Juan's instructions regarding the scope and purpose of the Dominican summons."

Let me trace back why this happened.\n\nLooking at Chapter 2.28 Summary, it covers \"July 1434 - Early 1435\" and includes:\n- Juan waiting in Naples for Lucia's delivery\n- The Ottoman diplomatic contact (Hamza Bey)\n- Bianca's birth in September 1434\n- Journey back to Toledo\n- Major council session in Toledo reorganizing finances\n\nThe timeline at the end shows:\n- September 14, 1434: Bianca born in Naples\n- November 1434: Departure from Naples\n- Late 1434/Early 1435: Journey to Toledo\n- Early 1435: Arrival in Toledo; reunion with Fernando\n- Early 1435: Major council session; financial reorganization\n\nSo the budget discussion happened in Toledo, early 1435, after they returned from Naples.\n\nBut the user just corrected me - they said \"I just finished the budget for 1434. But that does not mean that the actual date is January 1435. It is still the same day we finished drafting the budget, late summer 1434 or something.\"\n\nSo the user is saying we're still in late summer 1434, and we're in Toledo. But wait - Chapter 2.28 says Juan was in Naples waiting for Lucia's delivery until November 1434...\n\nLet me re-read the user's correction: \"I just finished the budget for 1434. But that does not mean that the actual date is januari 1435.\"\n\nHmm, but the Chapter 2.28 summary clearly states the council session with financial reorganization happened in \"Early 1435\" in Toledo after arriving from Naples...\n\nActually, let me look more carefully. The user said they're in Toledo, not Naples. And they said late summer 1434. But that contradicts the Chapter 2.28 summary which has them in Naples until November 1434.\n\nThe user is the player and controls the narrative reality. If they say we're in Toledo in late summer 1434, then I need to accept that. \n\nI might have misinterpreted the timeline, conflating different events and locations. My assumption about Naples and early 1435 could be incorrect. The player's direct statement suggests a different sequence of events that doesn't align with the chapter summary.\n\nI recognize my mistake in mixing up the narrative details. The correct context is Toledo during late summer 1434, which requires careful attention to the specific chapter narrative. Moving forward with precision means acknowledging the error and focusing on the accurate setting.\n\n\nYou're absolutely right, and I apologize for the error.\n\n\nLooking back at my reasoning: I read through the Chapter 2.28 summary which heavily featured Naples (Lucia's pregnancy, Hamza Bey's arrival, the waiting period), and I incorrectly placed the budget discussion there. The summary's timeline actually shows the financial reorganization council happening in Toledo, but I conflated the Naples material with the scene we were continuing.\n\n\nAdditionally, I jumped ahead temporally despite your explicit instruction not to advance the timeline—first to \"Early 1435\" in my initial response, and then kept the Naples setting even after you corrected the date.\n\n\nThe honest answer is: I wasn't reading carefully enough and let the Naples references in the chapter summary override the actual context you established.\n\n\n\nCorrected:\n\n\nCHAPTER 2.29: The Reckoning\n\n\nLate Summer 1434 — Toledo\n\n\n\nDiego nods, making quick notes as the orders flow.\n\n\n\"The admiral request I shall draft for His Majesty of Aragón's attention,\" he says. \"A courier to Naples should reach King Alfonso within a fortnight.\"\n\n\nHe consults his notes. \"For leather, salt, and silk—I can summon their representatives promptly.

Perhaps two to three weeks.\"\n\n\nHe pauses at the mention of Dominicans.\n\n\n\"A large Dominican delegation, Your Majesty?

      "say": "Thought process: Examined succession complexities across Aragon and Naples realms.\n\nJuan is asking about the succession situation with Alfonso V of Aragon. Let me think through what I know from the campaign:\n\n1. Alfonso V of Aragon is married but has no legitimate children (mentioned in Chapter 2.28 and elsewhere)\n2. The Infantes Juan and Enrique de Aragón (Alfonso's brothers) are both dead as of early 1431, along with Carlos, Prince of Viana\n3. Juan II of Castile has some kind of agreement with Alfonso where:\n   - Alfonso recognizes Juan as his heir\n   - Alfonso serves as regent for Castile if Juan dies before Fernando comes of age\n\nSo the question is: if Alfonso dies, who would contest Juan's claim to Aragon and Naples?\n\nLet me think about the Aragonese succession:\n- Alfonso V has no children\n- His brothers Juan and Enrique are dead (in this alternate timeline)\n- Carlos, Prince of Viana (son of Infante Juan) is also dead\n\nWho else might have claims?\n- Alfonso's sisters or other relatives\n- The Trastámara family tree in Aragon would have other branches\n- María of Castile (Alfonso's wife) - she's Juan II of Castile's sister\n\nActually wait, I need to be careful here. María of Castile is married to Alfonso V. So Juan II's sister is the Queen of Aragon. But she doesn't inherit - Aragon follows male preference succession.\n\nLooking at the Aragonese royal family:\n- Fernando I of Aragon (d. 1416) had sons:\n  - Alfonso V (current king, no children)\n  - Juan (Infante, King of Navarre - DEAD in this timeline)\n  - Enrique (Infante - DEAD in this timeline)\n  - María (married to Juan II of Castile - wait, no, that's wrong)\n  - Eleanor\n  - Pedro (died young?)\n\nLet me reconsider. In the historical timeline:\n\n\nI realize I've mixed up some family connections. María is indeed Alfonso V's wife and Juan II's sister, confirming the complex familial relationships in the Trastámara royal network. The succession remains complicated, with no direct male heir for Alfonso V and multiple potential claimants through the extended royal family.\n\nPotential succession challenges emerge from several angles: distant Trastámara relatives, papal interests in Naples, competing noble factions, and complex inheritance rules within the Crown of Aragon. The political landscape requires nuanced navigation, with Álvaro likely understanding the intricate diplomatic maneuvering needed to resolve these delicate succession questions.\n\nThe key considerations involve verifying lineage claims, securing papal approval for Naples, and ensuring proper legal documentation of any succession agreement. Political sophistication will be critical in managing these potential conflicts and establishing a clear, legitimate transfer of power.\n\n\nÁlvaro's expression sharpens. This is the kind of question he lives for—the intricate dance of succession and claim that determines whether kingdoms endure or shatter.\n\n\n\"Contested? Almost certainly, Your Majesty. The question is by whom and with what strength.\"\n\n\nHe begins to pace slowly, organizing his thoughts.\n\n\n\"Let us consider Aragón first. King Alfonso's brothers—the Infantes Juan and Enrique—are dead. Young Carlos of Viana is dead. The direct male line has grown remarkably thin.\" He pauses. \"But the Trastámara tree has other branches. Alfonso has sisters. There may be cousins through cadet lines. The Aragonese Cortes will have opinions—they guard their liberties fiercely and may not welcome union with Castile, whatever documents exist.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to face Juan.\n\n\n\"And Naples... Naples is a papal fief, Your Majesty. Pope Eugenius invested Alfonso with that crown. Upon Alfonso's death, Rome will expect a say in who inherits. The Angevins have not abandoned their claims—René of Anjou still breathes and still styles himself King of Naples. French interests will not simply accept a Castilian inheritance of both Aragón and Naples.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro folds his arms.\n\n\n\"The document you hold—is it witnessed? Registered with notaries? Known to the Aragonese Cortes, to Rome, to the great lords? Or does it exist only between two kings who might both die before it can be enforced?\"\n\n\n\nHe waits for Juan's answer."

Let me think about what Álvaro would realistically say here.\n\nFirst, about Alfonso's document naming Juan as heir - this is significant but succession in medieval kingdoms wasn't purely about documents. The Aragonese Cortes had significant power, and foreign inheritance could be contested.\n\nSecond, about René of Anjou - the user says René gave up his claims as part of surrender terms. Let me check what I know from the chapter summaries...\n\nLooking at Chapter 2.27, it mentions René of Anjou was defeated and returned to France. The surrender terms would have included renunciation of claims.\n\nBut Álvaro, being the shrewd political operator he is, would point out several realities:\n\n1. \"Unhonourable\" doesn't stop people from pressing claims when circumstances change\n2. René might claim the surrender was made under duress\n3. The French crown might press the claim on René's behalf regardless of what René himself signed\n4. Papal involvement in Naples means Rome's opinion matters enormously\n5. Documents between kings can be disputed, especially if the inheriting king is seen as a foreign conqueror rather than a legitimate successor\n\nÁlvaro should be realistic and slightly cynical about honor in international politics. He's seen too much to believe pieces of paper guarantee anything without the power to enforce them.\n\n\nÁlvaro allows himself a thin smile—not mocking, but the weary expression of a man who has spent decades in the snake pit of Iberian politics.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, with respect... when has honour stopped a dispossessed prince from pressing his claim?\"\n\n\nHe moves closer, lowering his voice as though the walls themselves might carry tales.\n\n\n\"René signed papers under duress—defeated, humiliated, his army destroyed. The moment circumstances change, he or his heirs will discover those papers were signed 'under compulsion' and therefore invalid. The French lawyers are very skilled at finding reasons why treaties no longer bind. And behind René stands the King of France, who has his own interests in keeping Aragonese power out of Italy.\"\n\n\nHe raises a hand, ticking off points on his fingers.\n\n\n\"Alfonso's document naming you heir—this is valuable, yes. But Alfonso is alive. He may yet father children. He may change his mind. He may face pressure from Aragonese nobles who do not wish their kingdom swallowed by Castile. And when he dies, whoever holds the stronger army and the Pope's favour will determine what those papers are worth.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro meets Juan's eyes directly.\n\n\n\"I do not say this to discourage you, Your Majesty. I say it because preparing for contestation is wisdom. What matters is not whether your claim is honourable—it is. What matters is whether, when the moment comes, you have the alliances, the armies, and the papal support to enforce it.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"What prompts this question now?\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro waits."

Juan is asking for something that represents a shift in his approach to rulership - moving from the relatively straightforward world of Iberian politics and crusading to the darker, more Byzantine (literally) world of espionage, assassination, and covert operations.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna is the perfect person to have this conversation with. He's a political survivor, a man who has navigated the treacherous waters of Castilian noble politics for decades. He knows how to play the game. But this is a step further - Juan is asking about creating an actual intelligence apparatus.\n\nLet me think about how Álvaro would respond:\n\n1. He would recognize the validity of Juan's concerns - Constantinople IS a different world, and Byzantine politics are legendary for their complexity and danger.\n\n2. He would probably have some experience with informal intelligence networks - any powerful political figure in medieval Castile would have informants, people who report on noble movements, etc.\n\n3. But a formal spymaster, someone who thinks about assassination and counter-assassination? This is a different level.\n\n4. Álvaro might have candidates in mind, or he might need to think about it.\n\n5. There's also a moral/spiritual dimension here - Juan has been wrestling with questions of faith and whether his path is righteous. Fray Hernando would have opinions about employing assassins and poisoners. But Álvaro is more pragmatic.\n\nLet me have Álvaro respond thoughtfully - acknowledging the need, perhaps expressing some concerns about the \"deploying similar tactics\" part (which could mean assassination), and offering to think about candidates or perhaps suggesting someone.\n\nI should NOT make this too easy. Finding a good spymaster is not simple. This person would need to be:\n- Absolutely loyal\n- Cunning and paranoid\n- Discreet\n- Knowledgeable about poisons, methods of assassination\n- Willing to do dark things\n\nWhere would such a person come from in 1434 Castile? \n\nOptions:\n- A converso with connections to Jewish networks (they have extensive trade connections across the Mediterranean)\n\n\n- A military intelligence officer with proven skills in reconnaissance and information gathering\n- An Italian specialist versed in the intricate arts of political manipulation\n- A potential ecclesiastical candidate with experience in investigative techniques\n\nÁlvaro would carefully weigh these options, understanding the delicate nature of establishing an intelligence network. He'd likely recommend a measured approach - identifying potential candidates, testing their capabilities, and gradually building a trusted network of informants and operatives who could navigate the complex political landscape.\n\nThe key would be finding someone who combines loyalty, discretion, and a deep understanding of the shadowy world of medieval intelligence gathering. It's not just about finding a skilled operative, but someone who can be trusted with the most sensitive information of the realm.\n\nCritically, Álvaro would seek clarity on Juan's intentions - whether the goal is purely defensive protection or if it extends to more aggressive, potentially morally fraught offensive actions that could involve eliminating enemies through covert means.\n\n\nÁlvaro is silent for a long moment. The late afternoon light catches the grey at his temples as he considers Juan's words.\n\n\n\"I have survived twenty years in Castilian politics, Your Majesty. I am not unfamiliar with... the darker arts of statecraft.\" His voice is quiet, measured. \"I have informants among the noble houses. I know which servants can be bought, which lords have debts they would rather keep hidden. But what you describe—Byzantine methods—this is a different order of magnitude.\"\n\n\nHe moves to the window, looking out over Toledo.\n\n\n\"Protection I can improve. Your food tasters, your guards, the rotation of servants with access to your chambers—these things can be tightened. But a true spymaster...\" He turns back. \"Such a man must think like a murderer while remaining absolutely loyal. He must have no ambitions of his own, no family that can be threatened, no price at which he can be bought. He must be invisible and yet see everything.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro pauses, his expression grave.\n\n\n\"You speak also of deploying such tactics against your enemies. I must ask plainly, Your Majesty—do you mean only espionage and intelligence? Or do you mean...\" He lets the question hang. \"The poison in the cup. The knife in the dark. The accident on the stairs.\"\n\n\nHis eyes meet Juan's steadily.\n\n\n\"I will serve you in whatever you command. But I would know the full scope of what you ask me to build.\"\n\n\n\nHe waits for Juan's answer."

The failure range should be wider.\n\n\n\"Wise,\" Álvaro nods. \"Tomás de Cuenca joins the royal household as a physician. No one need know his other uses.\"\n\n\nHe rises, pacing again as his mind turns to the darker task.\n\n\n\"The knife in the dark is... more difficult, Your Majesty. A poisoner can be found among physicians and apothecaries—educated men with reasons to be near courts. But a true assassin?\" He shakes his head slowly. \"The men who kill for coin are usually thugs. Crude. Capable of stabbing a merchant in an alley, perhaps, but not of reaching a guarded prince in a fortified palace.\"\n\n\nHe turns to face Juan.\n\n\n\"What we need is something rarer. Someone who can move unseen, gain access to protected places, strike without being caught, and—most importantly—escape afterward. Or die silent if they cannot.\"\n\n\n\nFINDING AN ASSASSIN: D100 TABLE\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nRoyal resources and Álvaro's networks\n\nGranada's fall has displaced Nasrid agents and palace guards trained in intrigue\n\nThe Naples campaign ended recently—mercenaries and soldiers of fortune linger in the region\n\nMoney is no object\n\nThe Military Orders may know of men who have done... quiet work\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nProfessional assassins of true skill are extraordinarily rare\n\nThose who exist are bound to Italian courts, Ottoman service, or other powerful masters\n\nSearch must remain absolutely secret—exposure would be catastrophic\n\nCastile has no tradition of political assassination; networks don't exist\n\nAn assassin who can be bought can be bought by your enemies\n\nAnyone skilled enough leaves a trail of people who want them dead\n\nFinding skill AND loyalty AND discretion in one person borders on impossible\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nDisaster: The search is noticed. Rumors begin to circulate, or worse—someone now has leverage over the crown.\n16-30\nThugs and Liars: Only crude killers and braggarts. No one remotely suitable. The underworld of Castile disappoints.\n31-45\nDangerous Prospect: A candidate emerges, but deeply flawed—uncontrollable, mad, or clearly waiting to betray whoever employs them.\n46-60\nSoldier, Not Shadow: A capable killer—veteran soldier, former mercenary—but not trained in infiltration or subtlety. Useful in some scenarios only.\n61-75\nPromising but Complicated: Someone with genuine skill, but acquiring them requires negotiation, extraction from current obligations, or overcoming significant obstacles.\n76-88\nSkilled and Available: A true professional, experienced and discreet. Will require careful vetting and terms, but viable.\n89-100\nGhost: An exceptional find—someone trained by masters, loyal for reasons beyond coin, with no ties that can be exploited.

Let me narrate this appropriately.\n\n\nÁlvaro's search stretches over weeks.

Let me draft a d100 table for this search.\n\nA spymaster is different from both a poisoner and an assassin. This is someone who:\n- Gathers intelligence\n- Manages networks of informants\n- Identifies weaknesses in their own security\n- Spots enemy agents\n- Thinks in terms of information and secrets\n\nThis is actually a more \"civilized\" role in some ways - closer to what Álvaro already does, but specialized and dedicated to it.\n\nLet me think about success and failure factors for finding a spymaster in 1430s Castile.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods slowly, understanding dawning.\n\n\n\"Forgive me, Your Majesty.

A candidate turns out to be in service to a rival power, and now knows the King of Castile seeks to build an intelligence network.\n11-25\nEmpty Nets: Months of searching produce only petty informants, ambitious minor officials, and men who mistake gossip for intelligence. No one suitable.\n26-40\nFlawed Vessel: A candidate with genuine talent but critical weaknesses—drinks too much, harbors secret grudges, cannot resist boasting, or has divided loyalties.\n41-55\nAdministrator, Not Mastermind: A competent organizer who could manage an existing network, but lacks the creative paranoia to build one from nothing or anticipate sophisticated threats.\n56-70\nPromising but Raw: Someone with natural talent and the right instincts, but inexperienced. Would require years of development to reach full potential.\n71-85\nSolid Professional: An experienced intelligence operative—perhaps from Italian or Church service—available and capable.

I need to create a compelling NPC who fits this description - someone with genuine talent, loyalty grounded in something real (not just money), and immediately useful capabilities. \n\nLet me think about who this could be:\n- Should have a compelling backstory that explains their skills\n- Should have a genuine reason to be loyal to Juan specifically\n- Should have existing networks or capabilities\n- Should be memorable and interesting as a character\n\nGiven the context of the campaign - Granada recently conquered, converso communities, Byzantine intrigue encountered - there are several directions I could go:\n\n1. A converso with extensive merchant networks\n2. A former Nasrid court official who survived the transition\n3. Someone connected to the Church's intelligence apparatus\n4. A Byzantine exile who fled the intrigue there\n5. Someone from the Italian city-states\n\nI think a converso angle could be really interesting - they have reasons to be loyal to Juan (who has shown tolerance), they have networks spanning Christendom through Jewish merchant connections, and they have motivation (protecting their community from persecution).\n\nOr perhaps someone with a more personal connection to Juan's story - maybe someone who observed Juan's actions and was impressed, or whose family benefited from Juan's policies.\n\nLet me craft someone compelling. I'll make them genuinely talented but also grounded - not a cartoon superspy, but someone with real skills developed over years.\n\n\nÁlvaro's expression when he returns is... different.

Dark, watchful, taking in the room in a single glance that somehow seems to note everything—the positions of the windows, the thickness of the walls, the distance to the door.\n\n\nHe bows correctly. Not too deep, not too shallow.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His voice is quiet, measured. \"Thank you for receiving me.\"\n\n\nHe straightens and waits, hands folded before him. He does not fidget. He does not look around nervously. He simply... observes. Patient as a cat watching a mousehole.\n\n\n\"Don Álvaro has told you what I offered as proof of my usefulness. I can tell you more—the kitchen boy who steals wine is harmless, but the seamstress who mends the queen's garments asks too many questions about Her Majesty's schedule.

This is a significant moment - Juan is essentially offering a converso a position of immense trust and power, albeit in secret.\n\nLet me think about how Isaac would respond to this. According to my NPC guidelines:\n\n1. What does Isaac want?\n- Security and purpose after years of wandering\n- To serve someone who treats conversos fairly (he mentioned this as his motivation)\n- To use his considerable talents\n- Possibly some form of legacy or meaning after losing his family\n\n2. What won't he say?\n- He won't immediately gush with gratitude - that's not his character\n- He may not reveal all his reservations upfront\n- He's too professional to be sycophantic\n\n3. What has he seen?\n- He's seen Juan's treatment of the Moors in Granada - conversion without massacre\n- He's seen the vulnerabilities in Juan's household\n- He's clearly researched Juan extensively\n\nIsaac is a professional. He's been offered exactly what he came seeking, but he's also cautious by nature. He wouldn't simply accept without clarifying terms and expectations. He might also want to test Juan a bit more - see if the king understands what he's truly asking for.\n\nThe roll was 92 - exceptional find, loyal for substantive reasons. So Isaac WILL accept, but he should do so in character - with professional clarity about what this means.\n\nHe should:\n- Accept, but with some conditions or clarifications\n- Make clear what he will and won't do\n- Perhaps test Juan's resolve about the darker aspects of this work\n- Show that his loyalty is genuine but not sycophantic\n\nLet me write his response.\n\n\nIsaac is silent for a long moment. The fading afternoon light catches something in his eyes—a guard dropping, perhaps, for just an instant.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty offers much. More than I expected.\"\n\n\nHe finally moves to the chair and sits—not asking permission now, as though the offer itself has changed their relationship.\n\n\n\"I will accept. But first, you must understand what you are purchasing.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward, elbows on his knees.\n\n\n\"A spymaster does ugly work. I will bribe servants. I will read letters not meant for my eyes. I will cultivate informants in the households of your allies as well as your enemies—because today's ally is tomorrow's threat. I will learn secrets about men you respect, men you love, men of the Church. And sometimes, what I learn will be things you wish you did not know.\"\n\n\nHis voice is quiet but unflinching.\n\n\n\"I will also fail. No web catches every fly. Someday, despite my best efforts, an assassin will get closer than he should. A conspiracy will go undetected until it is nearly too late. When that happens, you must not lose faith in the enterprise—only demand I do better.\"\n\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\n\"And I require one thing above wages and resources. I require access. To you, directly, without intermediaries. Even Don Álvaro cannot always know what I know. Some secrets are safer in fewer heads.\"\n\n\nHe meets Juan's eyes.\n\n\n\"Do you accept these terms?\"\n\n\n\nIsaac waits."

He weighs it in his hand.\n\n\n\"Five hundred florins,\" he says quietly. \"I have never held this much at once in my life.\"\n\n\nHe tucks the bag into his doublet and rises.

Isaac has different networks than Álvaro - converso networks, connections to Italy, Greek refugees. He specifically mentioned a Greek woman in Naples from Thessaloniki whose family served the imperial court.\n\nLet me think about the success and failure factors here.\n\nSuccess Factors:\n- Isaac has specialized networks Álvaro lacks (converso, Italian, Byzantine exile connections)\n- He already has a specific lead - the Greek woman in Naples from Thessaloniki\n- Juan's resources are available\n- Recent fall of Thessaloniki and other Byzantine territories has displaced court servants westward\n- Naples is now under Alfonso V's control - friendly territory for searching\n- Isaac is a professional intelligence operative, better at finding hidden people\n- The converso networks span multiple countries and include physicians and scholars\n\nFailure Factors:\n- The Greek woman may be dead, moved, or unwilling\n- Byzantine exiles are suspicious of Latin rulers (Fourth Crusade memories)\n- A true poison master is extraordinarily rare\n- Those with real skill guard their secrets carefully\n- Ottoman agents may be watching Byzantine exiles\n- The search must remain secret\n- Even if found, trust must be established - why would they serve a Castilian king?\n- Naples is still chaotic from recent conquest\n\nThis should be a Chaos roll with genuine uncertainty.

Isaac's other channels produce nothing viable.\n21-35\nCharlatan or Competent: A candidate emerges but is no better than Tomás de Cuenca—educated in poisons but not a true master.\n36-50\nReluctant Prospect: A genuinely skilled individual is found, but deeply suspicious, traumatized, or bound by circumstances that make recruitment difficult.\n51-65\nSkilled but Complicated: A true poison master, but acquisition requires delicate negotiation, extraction from danger, or overcoming significant personal obstacles.\n66-80\nThe Greek Woman: Isaac's lead proves accurate.

      "say": "Thought process: Reconciled historical accuracy with character authenticity regarding inquisitorial procedures.\n\nThe user is asking Torquemada about the Inquisition and how to use it in Granada. This is a significant moment - Juan is essentially asking about establishing inquisitorial processes in his newly conquered territory.\n\nLet me think about what Torquemada would say here. He's a Dominican, and the Dominicans have been heavily involved in inquisitorial work since the 13th century. The medieval Inquisition was established by Pope Gregory IX in the 1230s, largely entrusted to the Dominicans.\n\nHowever, I need to be historically accurate here. The Spanish Inquisition as we know it wasn't established until 1478 under Ferdinand and Isabella - that's about 44 years in the future from 1434. Torquemada himself historically became the first Grand Inquisitor of Spain in 1483.\n\nIn 1434, there were inquisitorial structures in other parts of Europe - the papal inquisition operated in various places - but Castile didn't have a strong inquisitorial presence at this time. The Dominicans would know about inquisitorial procedures from their work elsewhere (France, Italy, Aragon had some inquisitorial activity).\n\nTorquemada should explain:\n1. The inquisition's purpose - finding heresy among the baptized (not converting infidels - that's different)\n2. The procedures - denunciation, investigation, interrogation, reconciliation or punishment\n3. The jurisdictional issues - inquisitorial authority comes from the Pope\n4. The distinction between converting Moors (missionary work) and finding heresy among conversos (inquisitorial work)\n\nHe should be intelligent and thoughtful about this - not a cartoon villain. The historical Torquemada was zealous but also learned. He should explain the realities and limitations, and perhaps show interest/ambition regarding Granada.\n\nThis is a complex topic and I should have Torquemada give a substantive answer that reflects Dominican understanding of inquisitorial procedures and the theological/jurisdictional realities.\n\n\nFray Tomás's sharp eyes gleam with interest. This is clearly a subject close to his heart.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty asks a question with many layers. Allow me to untangle them.\"\n\n\nHe steps forward, hands folded into his sleeves in the Dominican manner.\n\n\n\"First, we must distinguish between the infidel and the heretic. The Moor who has never been baptized is not subject to the Inquisition—he is an unbeliever, yes, but he has made no false promise to God. He is a matter for missionaries, not inquisitors. We preach to him, we persuade him, we pray for his conversion.\"\n\n\nHis voice sharpens.\n\n\n\"But the Moor who accepts baptism and then secretly practices his old faith? He is an apostate. A heretic. He has taken Christ's body into his mouth while his heart remains with Muhammad. This man falls under inquisitorial jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nTorquemada begins to pace slowly, like a professor before students.\n\n\n\"The methods are well-established, refined over two centuries. We receive denunciations—neighbors who notice a family does not eat pork, who hear Arabic prayers at night, who see lamps lit on the wrong days. We investigate quietly. We summon the accused. We give them opportunity to confess and reconcile—the Church desires repentance, not punishment.\"\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\"Those who confess sincerely are given penance. Those who persist in denial despite evidence... stronger measures become necessary.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to Juan.\n\n\n\"But Your Majesty must understand—inquisitorial authority flows from Rome, not from crowns. To establish tribunals in Granada would require papal mandate. The structures, the personnel, the procedures—all must be approved by His Holiness.\"\n\n\nHis eyes narrow thoughtfully.\n\n\n\"You have recently returned from Rome, I am told. And you hold Pope Eugenius's favor. This is... advantageous.\"\n\n\n\nTorquemada waits, watching Juan carefully."

      "say": "Thought process: Architected systematic inquisitorial framework balancing zealotry with pragmatic governance.\n\nJuan is asking Torquemada how he would go about establishing the Inquisition in Granada, assuming papal approval. This is a significant historical moment - the Spanish Inquisition wasn't established until 1478 under Ferdinand and Isabella, with Torquemada as the first Grand Inquisitor. Here we are in 1434, and Juan is already laying the groundwork.\n\nI need to have Torquemada respond thoughtfully, as an intelligent NPC pursuing his own goals. He's a Dominican, deeply committed to rooting out heresy. He would see this as a tremendous opportunity. But he's also smart - he'll want to understand the political landscape, what resources he'll have, and how much authority the crown will give him.\n\nLet me think about what Torquemada would realistically propose:\n\n1. He'd need to establish tribunals - physical locations with personnel\n2. He'd need qualified inquisitors - trained Dominicans\n3. He'd need a period of grace - standard practice where people could confess voluntarily before investigations began\n4. He'd need cooperation from local bishops and secular authorities\n5. He'd need to distinguish between new converts (who might backslide) and established Christians\n6. He'd probably want to start cautiously and build infrastructure\n\nHe would also likely have concerns:\n- The scale of Granada's Muslim population\n- The recent nature of the conquest - pushing too hard too fast could cause rebellion\n- The need for genuine conversion vs. coerced conversion\n- Resources and funding\n\nTorquemada historically was zealous but also methodical. He built a systematic institution. Let me have him present a thoughtful plan while also revealing his own motivations and concerns.\n\n\nTorquemada's expression sharpens. This is no longer theoretical discussion—this is planning.\n\n\n\"If His Holiness grants the mandate...\"\n\n\nHe gestures to one of the younger Dominicans, who produces a small writing tablet. Torquemada begins to pace, organizing his thoughts with the precision of a man who has contemplated this question for years.\n\n\n\"First, we must understand the ground. Granada has—what—three hundred thousand souls? Most still Muslim. Some converted during the conquest. More will convert in the coming years as they see Christian rule is permanent.\" He pauses. \"The Inquisition concerns itself only with the baptized. We do not pursue the Moor who remains openly Muslim. He is merely blind. We pursue the one who claims to see while walking in darkness.\"\n\n\nHe turns sharply.\n\n\n\"I would proceed in stages, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\n\"First: A period of grace. One year, perhaps two. We announce that any converso—whether from Islam or Judaism—who harbors secret doubts or has lapsed into old practices may come forward voluntarily. They confess. They receive penance. They are reconciled to the Church with no lasting mark upon them. This is mercy. This separates the weak from the wicked.\"\n\n\n\"Second: The tribunals. I would establish two initially. One in Granada city. One in Málaga. Each requires inquisitors—Dominicans trained in canon law and theology. Notaries to keep records. familiares—lay servants who act as our eyes and ears. A secure place for holding the accused.\"\n\n\nHis voice grows harder.\n\n\n\"Third: Investigation. After the period of grace expires, we begin receiving denunciations. We examine witnesses. We build cases. The accused are summoned, questioned, given opportunity to confess. Those who confess are penanced. Those who persist...\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"The Church does not shed blood, Your Majesty. Those found guilty and unrepentant are relaxed to the secular arm. The crown carries out sentence. This is the ancient division—we judge souls, you judge bodies.\"\n\n\nTorquemada stops pacing and faces Juan directly.\n\n\n\"But I must speak plainly. This is a work of generations, not months. Push too hard, too fast, and you will drive the conversos into hidden resistance. False conversions will multiply. The rot will spread underground where we cannot see it.\"\n\n\nHis eyes burn with conviction.\n\n\n\"Better to be patient. Let genuine conversions take root. Let the insincere reveal themselves over time. Then—\" He makes a sharp gesture. \"—cut out the corruption before it poisons the whole body.\"\n\n\nHe folds his hands.\n\n\n\"What resources would Your Majesty commit to this work?\"\n\n\n\nTorquemada waits, intensity barely contained."

      "say": "Thought process: Grappling with historical accuracy versus modern moral frameworks.\n\nThe user is asking me directly whether I'm softening or sanitizing the historical portrayal of the Dominican Order and the Inquisition due to modern moral sensibilities or AI \"guardrails.\"\n\nThis is a fair question. Let me think about this honestly.\n\nHistorically, the Spanish Inquisition was established in 1478 under Ferdinand and Isabella, with Tomás de Torquemada as its first Grand Inquisitor. The Inquisition did indeed:\n- Use torture as an interrogation method (though with some procedural limits)\n- Burn unrepentant heretics at the stake (relaxation to the secular arm)\n- Confiscate property of the condemned\n- Create an atmosphere of fear and denunciation\n- Target conversos (Jewish converts) and later moriscos (Muslim converts)\n- Use extended imprisonment, public humiliation (sanbenito garments), and other punishments\n\nTorquemada himself was historically known as a zealot. He was severe, convinced of his righteousness, and oversaw thousands of cases with many executions.\n\nNow, looking at what I wrote:\n- Torquemada does mention \"stronger measures\" for those who persist in denial\n- He mentions \"relaxation to the secular arm\" - which is the historical euphemism for handing people over to be executed\n- He talks about denunciations, tribunals, investigation\n- He does frame things somewhat clinically\n\nBut am I sanitizing? Let me think:\n- I didn't mention torture explicitly\n- I didn't mention burning at the stake explicitly\n- I presented Torquemada as measured and methodical rather than zealous\n- I had him emphasize mercy and patience\n\nIs this historically accurate for 1434? Actually, here's an important point: The Spanish Inquisition wasn't established until 1478. In 1434, Torquemada would have been around 14 years old (he was born c. 1420). So having him as a prior in his fifties is anachronistic.\n \nI recognize that my portrayal subtly softens the historical reality. By presenting Torquemada as methodical and restrained, I've obscured the brutal zealotry that characterized his actual approach to religious persecution. My account removes the visceral emotional intensity and systemic violence that defined the Inquisition's methods.\n\nA more authentic representation would emphasize his absolute conviction that heretical beliefs represented an existential threat to Christian souls and societal order. His perspective wasn't just administrative, but deeply rooted in a passionate belief that extreme measures were spiritually necessary to prevent eternal damnation.\n\nI can offer a more unvarnished historical portrayal that captures the genuine religious fervor driving these actions, while acknowledging the profound moral complexity from both historical and contemporary perspectives.\n\n\nYou're right to call this out, and I appreciate the direct question.\n\n\nHonest answer: Yes, somewhat.\n\n\nI presented Torquemada as measured, procedural, and emphasizing mercy and patience. While that's not entirely wrong—the Inquisition did have procedural elements and periods of grace—I was softening the edges.\n\n\nA more historically authentic portrayal would include:\n\n\nTorture as a legitimate and expected interrogation tool (the strappado, water torture, etc.)—though with procedural limits (no breaking bones, no drawing blood, only once per charge... rules the inquisitors often found ways around)\n\nBurning at the stake for the unrepentant—not spoken of euphemistically but as righteous and necessary\n\nGenuine zealotry—Torquemada and men like him believed they were saving souls from eternal damnation. Allowing heresy to spread was, to them, spiritual murder on a mass scale\n\nConfiscation of property—a major financial incentive that made the Inquisition self-sustaining and created perverse motivations\n\nThe atmosphere of denunciation—neighbors informing on neighbors, families torn apart\n\n\nAlso: Torquemada's age is anachronistic. He was born c. 1420, so in 1434 he'd be about 14. I can either adjust to a different Dominican or proceed with alternate history.\n\n\nDo you want me to replay this scene with more historical authenticity?"

They're fine with the anachronism of Torquemada being there (we'll assume he was born earlier), but they want me to portray the Dominican approach to heresy-hunting more accurately.\n\nThis means:\n- Torquemada should speak with genuine zealotry - he believes he is saving souls from eternal damnation\n- Torture should be mentioned as a normal, expected part of interrogation\n- Burning at the stake should be discussed matter-of-factly as the appropriate end for unrepentant heretics\n- Confiscation of property should be mentioned\n- The atmosphere of denunciation - this was how the Inquisition functioned\n- The genuine belief that allowing heresy to spread was worse than physical death - it was spiritual murder\n\nI should replay the scene from when Juan asks \"If he would, how would you go about it?\"\n\nLet me write this with historical authenticity. Torquemada was known for his severity and uncompromising nature. He genuinely believed he was doing God's work. The Spanish Inquisition, when it was eventually established in 1478, was notable for its thoroughness and its use of torture and execution.\n\nI need to be careful here - this is historical simulation, not endorsement. The user has explicitly asked for historical accuracy in their alternate history game. This is legitimate historical exploration.\n\n\nUnderstood. Let me replay the scene with historical authenticity.\n\n\n\nTorquemada's expression sharpens. This is no longer theoretical discussion—this is planning. His eyes carry the fire of a man who has spent decades contemplating the corruption of souls.\n\n\n\"If His Holiness grants the mandate...\"\n\n\nHe steps forward, and there is nothing soft in his bearing.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty must understand what the Inquisition is. It is not persecution—it is salvation. When a man takes baptism and then returns to his vomit like a dog, he damns not only himself but all he touches. His children learn his lies. His neighbors are corrupted by his example. Heresy spreads like plague, and the souls lost to hellfire multiply beyond counting.\"\n\n\nHis voice hardens.\n\n\n\"To allow this is not mercy. It is cruelty—the cruelty of a physician who refuses to amputate a gangrenous limb and watches the patient die entire. We cut away the rot so the body may live.\"\n\n\nHe begins to pace.\n\n\n\"In Granada, you have three hundred thousand souls. Most are infidels—blind, yes, but not yet guilty of betraying Christ. They will convert, over time. Pressure. Incentive. The slow realization that their world has ended and ours has begun.\"\n\n\nA sharp gesture.\n\n\n\"But some will convert falsely. They will mouth the words, take the water, eat the Host—and then return home to wash off their baptism, to pray toward Mecca, to teach their children that Christ was merely a prophet. These are our concern.\"\n\n\nHe turns to face Juan directly.\n\n\n\"I would proceed thus:\"\n\n\n\"First: Establish the tribunals. Granada city, Málaga, perhaps Almería. Each requires inquisitors—Dominican brothers trained in theology and canon law. Notaries to record every word spoken. Familiares—laymen who serve as our eyes and ears among the populace. And a secure place for holding and questioning the accused.\"\n\n\n\"Second: A period of grace. Thirty days, perhaps sixty, during which any who have lapsed may come forward voluntarily. They confess their sins, they are reconciled, they receive penance—perhaps a pilgrimage, perhaps the wearing of the sanbenito for a period, perhaps a fine. But they keep their lives and their property. This separates the weak from the wicked.\"\n\n\n\"Third: Denunciation. After grace expires, we receive accusations. A neighbor notices a family refuses pork. A servant reports hearing Arabic prayers. A child mentions that his father washes in a peculiar manner before worship.\" Torquemada's eyes are cold. \"We investigate. We gather testimony. We build the case in secret—the accused does not know he is under investigation until we are ready.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth: Arrest and interrogation. The accused is taken. His property is seized and inventoried—this funds the Holy Office and removes resources that might be used for flight or resistance. He is questioned. He is shown the evidence against him. He is urged to confess and reconcile.\"\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\"If he confesses freely, penance. If he denies despite evidence...\" Torquemada's voice does not waver. \"The Church permits quaestio—the question. The strappado. Water. Methods that persuade the body to release what the tongue conceals. There are rules—no blood, no permanent maiming, applied only once per charge. But the rules exist to be applied, Your Majesty, not to prevent application.\"\n\n\n\"Fifth: Judgment. Those who confess under question and repent sincerely are reconciled—penanced, yes, often imprisoned, their property forfeit, but alive. Those who confess but are judged insincere, those who relapse after previous reconciliation, those who persist in denial despite proof...\"\n\n\nHe meets Juan's eyes without flinching.\n\n\n\"The Church does not shed blood. We relax the unrepentant to the secular arm with a plea for mercy. The crown then does what must be done. The fire purifies. And the auto-da-fé—the act of faith—shows all who watch that heresy leads only to destruction.\"\n\n\nTorquemada folds his hands into his sleeves.\n\n\n\"This is not cruelty, Your Majesty. A heretic who dies repentant may yet find God's grace. One who lives and spreads his poison damns dozens, hundreds, for eternity. We save souls—sometimes despite themselves.\"\n\n\nHis gaze is unwavering.\n\n\n\"What resources would Your Majesty commit to this holy work?\"\n\n\n\nTorquemada waits, burning certainty in his eyes."

Having the crown fund the Inquisition directly\n\nThis removes the perverse incentive where the Inquisition profits directly from finding heretics, which historically led to abuses and targeting of wealthy individuals.\n\nTorquemada might have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, it removes a source of direct revenue. On the other hand, if he's a true zealot focused on saving souls rather than enriching the institution, he might actually appreciate being freed from the appearance (or temptation) of profit motive.\n\nI should play Torquemada as the historical zealot he was - someone genuinely concerned with rooting out heresy.

He offers a slight bow.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nHis eyes carry a hint of something—amusement, perhaps, or professional curiosity.\n\n\n\"I observed your meeting with the Dominicans from the passage behind the eastern wall. The acoustics are excellent—I heard every word.\" He pauses. \"Fray Tomás is a man of considerable conviction. Dangerous, in his way. But useful, if his fire is properly directed.\"\n\n\nHe folds his hands.\n\n\n\"You wished to see me. How may I serve?\"\n\n\n\nIsaac waits, patient as ever."

      "say": "Thought process: Identified critical vulnerabilities across succession, naval power, and eastern legitimacy.\n\nThis is a fascinating question from Juan to Isaac. He's asking his new spymaster for a strategic assessment of his position and what gaps exist in his ambitions.\n\nIsaac is a shrewd observer who has watched Juan from the outside and now serves him. He should provide an honest, possibly uncomfortable assessment. Let me think about what a skilled spymaster would identify as gaps or risks:\n\n1. **Succession** - Juan has Catalina (a daughter) and is expecting another child with Lucia. But his heir situation is uncertain. If he dies, everything falls apart. The empire depends on him personally.\n\n2. **Naval power** - Castile is a land power. An empire stretching to Anatolia requires naval dominance. The Venetians and Genoese control Mediterranean trade. The Ottomans have growing naval capacity.\n\n3. **Intelligence networks in the East** - Isaac was hired for Castile, but Juan's ambitions stretch to Constantinople and beyond. He needs eyes and ears in Venice, Genoa, the Ottoman court, the Byzantine factions.\n\n4. **The Ottoman threat** - Murad II is not going to simply accept Juan's presence. The Tenedos meeting is coming. What happens after?\n\n5. **Legitimacy in the East** - Juan is \"Defensor Romaniae\" but he's still a Latin, still a Frank. The Greeks remember 1204. How does he build genuine loyalty among people who have every reason to distrust him?\n\n6. **Overextension** - The classic imperial problem. Too many commitments, too few resources, too much distance.\n\n7. **The Papacy** - Juan relies heavily on papal favor. What happens when Eugenius dies? The next pope may not be so friendly.\n\n8. **France** - The great power Juan hasn't really engaged with. France has interests in Italy (Naples), in the papacy, potentially in opposing any unified Iberian-Italian power bloc.\n\n9. **Communication and control** - How do you rule from Toledo and Constantinople simultaneously? Medieval logistics make this nearly impossible.\n \nJuan's personal risks and strategic vulnerabilities run deep. His physical safety is precarious, with dangerous diplomatic meetings and expansive ambitions that put him directly in harm's way. His marriage to Lucia d'Este provides some political connection, but his daughter Catalina represents an untapped strategic asset for potential alliances. The emerging tension with conversos, particularly given Isaac's own background, creates a complex internal political challenge that could undermine the very intelligence networks critical to Juan's success.\n\nIsaac must craft a response that demonstrates nuanced political awareness while subtly revealing his underlying vulnerability within this emerging Inquisitorial landscape.\n\n\nIsaac is silent for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice is quiet but precise—a man choosing each word with care.\n\n\n\"You honor me by asking, Your Majesty. Most kings want their spymasters to find threats, not to think.\"\n\n\nHe moves to a chair and sits without asking—their relationship has evolved past such formalities.\n\n\n\"You ask what you are missing. I will tell you, and some of it you will not enjoy hearing.\"\n\n\nHe raises one finger.\n\n\n\"Your empire exists only in your person. If you die tomorrow—at Tenedos, in your bed, from a fever—what remains? A daughter not yet three. A son still in swaddling clothes. A named heir in Alfonso who has his own kingdoms to manage. Regents who will quarrel. Nobles who will see opportunity.\" He pauses. \"Constantinople will look for a new protector within the month. Your reforms will stall. Your alliances will fray. Everything you have built rests on the heartbeat of one man.\"\n\n\nA second finger.\n\n\n\"You have no navy. You have asked Alfonso for an admiral—good. But Castile is a land power. Your knights conquered Granada. Your knights hold Constantinople. But between Iberia and Anatolia lies water, Your Majesty. The Venetians have six hundred galleys. The Genoese nearly as many. The Ottomans are building. You have... what? A handful of ships borrowed or hired?\"\n\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\n\"An empire of the Mediterranean requires mastery of the Mediterranean. Without it, your possessions are islands you cannot reinforce, cannot supply, cannot hold.\"\n\n\nA third finger.\n\n\n\"Your intelligence ends at your borders. You have hired me to watch Castile. But what do you know of what happens in the Ottoman court? In Venice? In the Papal curia when you are not present? In the Byzantine factions that smile at you while writing letters to your enemies?\"\n\n\nHis eyes are hard.\n\n\n\"You walked into Constantinople blind and nearly died for it. You will walk into Tenedos equally blind. The Sultan will know more about you than you know about him. He has had agents watching you for months—perhaps years. What agents do you have watching him?\"\n\n\nA fourth finger.\n\n\n\"France.\" The single word hangs in the air. \"You have not mentioned France, Your Majesty. Perhaps you do not think of them. They think of you. A unified Iberia allied with Aragón and Naples, holding influence over the Papacy, projecting power into the Eastern Mediterranean...\" He shakes his head. \"This is a nightmare for Paris. René of Anjou signed papers surrendering Naples. The King of France did not sign those papers. When the moment is right, they will move against you. Not with armies—not yet. With gold, with marriages, with whispers, with daggers.\"\n\n\nA fifth finger.\n\n\n\"Your converso networks.\"\n\n\nIsaac pauses here, and something shifts in his expression. More personal.\n\n\n\"You have just commissioned Torquemada to hunt heretics. I understand why—the Church binds society, false converts are rot, you believe this sincerely.\" He meets Juan's eyes. \"But the men who run your tax farms, who manage your trade, who serve as physicians and translators and intermediaries with the Muslim world—many are conversos. And the networks I use to gather intelligence? They are converso networks. Families connected by marriage and commerce across every kingdom in Christendom and beyond.\"\n\n\nHis voice grows quieter.\n\n\n\"The Inquisition will not distinguish between the false convert and the sincere one who merely has a cousin who has a friend who once said something questionable. Denouncement becomes a weapon for settling grudges. The skilled and the connected become targets because they have enemies and property worth seizing.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"I am not asking you to abandon Torquemada. I am telling you that the purification you seek and the intelligence networks you need are fed by the same roots. Burn one, and the other withers. You must decide how to balance this—or accept that your eyes in distant places will slowly go blind.\"\n\n\nIsaac sits back.\n\n\n\"You asked what you are missing. There is your answer: Succession. Ships. Spies abroad. France. And the contradiction between purity and knowledge.\"\n\n\nHe folds his hands.\n\n\n\"Where would Your Majesty like to begin?\"\n\n\n\nIsaac waits, watching Juan with those unreadable eyes."

      "say": "Thought process: Catalogued multifaceted succession strategies beyond direct heirs.\n\nJuan is asking about succession planning beyond just having more children. This is a legitimate medieval political question. Let me think about what options a medieval king would have:\n\n1. **Strengthening the heir's position** - Making sure Fernando (his son) is recognized, educated, protected\n2. **Regency arrangements** - Already has Alfonso V named as regent, but could strengthen this\n3. **Institutional continuity** - Creating structures that outlast the king\n4. **Marriage alliances** - Securing his children's futures through strategic marriages\n5. **Eliminating rival claimants** - Though the Infantes are dead, there may be others\n6. **Training and preparing heirs** - Though Fernando is an infant\n7. **Creating a council or structure** that ensures continuity\n8. **Binding key nobles and advisors** to the succession through oaths, rewards, self-interest\n9. **Papal recognition** of the succession\n10. **Making the succession internationally recognized** through treaties\n\nIsaac should give practical medieval advice here. He's a spymaster, so he'll think about this from angles of security, loyalty, and political reality.\n\n\nIsaac allows himself a thin smile.\n\n\n\"Getting Queen Lucia pregnant again is indeed the simplest answer. But it is not the only one.\"\n\n\nHe rises and moves to the window, thinking aloud.\n\n\n\"Succession is not merely about having heirs. It is about making those heirs inevitable. Removing alternatives. Binding powerful men to your children's futures so tightly that supporting them becomes self-interest, not loyalty.\"\n\n\nHe turns back.\n\n\n\"Consider what the Byzantines do—poorly, which is why they murder each other constantly. And consider what the Ottomans do—brutally, but effectively. The Sultan's heir is not merely his son. His heir is surrounded by men whose fortunes depend entirely on that heir taking the throne. Viziers, generals, governors—all appointed by the Sultan, all knowing they will be swept away if a rival prince wins. They protect the succession because they protect themselves.\"\n\n\nHe begins to count on his fingers.\n\n\n\"First: Fernando must be seen. He is an infant now, yes. But as he grows, he must be present. At councils. At ceremonies. The nobles must watch him grow, know his face, hear his voice. A king men have never met is easy to replace. A prince they have watched become a man is harder to set aside.\"\n\n\n\"Second: Bind the great houses to his future. Betrothals. Promises of office. Lands that will be confirmed when Fernando takes the throne—not before. Don Íñigo's Council of Great Houses is a start. Make them invested in continuity. Make rebellion against your heir into rebellion against their own futures.\"\n\n\n\"Third: The regency must be unassailable. You have named Alfonso. Good. But put it in writing, witnessed by the Pope, by the Cortes, by every great lord in Castile. Make it so public, so embedded in law and custom, that challenging it means challenging everything.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"Fourth: Eliminate alternatives.\"\n\n\nHis voice drops.\n\n\n\"The Infantes are dead. Young Carlos is dead. But the Trastámara tree has other branches, however distant. Cousins. Bastards. Men with a drop of royal blood and an ambitious wife whispering in their ear. You need not kill them—but you must know them. Track them. Ensure they hold no offices, command no soldiers, accumulate no wealth. Keep them comfortable and powerless.\"\n\n\n\"Fifth: Institutions that outlast you.\"\n\n\nIsaac meets Juan's eyes.\n\n\n\"This is the hardest, but the most important. You have reformed the tax system—but it depends on Diego de Daza. You have Álvaro managing the nobles—but he is one man. You have me watching the shadows—but I could die tomorrow.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"Create offices, not men. A treasury with procedures that any competent administrator can follow. A royal council with defined roles that continue regardless of who fills them. A military structure that does not collapse when a single commander falls. Make the kingdom a machine that runs whether Juan II sits the throne or Fernando I—or a regent in Fernando's name.\"\n\n\nHe sits again.\n\n\n\"None of this guarantees succession. A determined enough conspiracy can unseat any heir. But it raises the cost. It makes stability easier than chaos. It means that when you die—whether at forty or eighty—the men around your son will look at each other and think: easier to let the boy rule than to tear everything apart.\"\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\"That is how you secure succession without relying solely on your wife's womb.\"\n\n\n\nIsaac waits for Juan's response."

This is a major undertaking - establishing spy networks in foreign courts is extremely difficult and takes time, resources, and the right people.\n\nIsaac should respond realistically about:\n1. The difficulty of this task\n2. What resources he'll need\n3. How long it will take\n4. The risks involved\n5. What's possible vs. what's aspirational\n\nHe should also note Juan's comment about feeling \"invincible\" - this is concerning for a spymaster whose job is to anticipate threats. But Isaac is smart enough to not lecture the king too much.\n\nLet me think about how Isaac would approach building networks in:\n\n**Ottoman Empire:**\n- Converso networks have some reach into Ottoman lands (Jews expelled from various places often ended up in Ottoman territory where they were tolerated)\n- Venetian and Genoese merchants trade extensively with the Ottomans\n- Greek exiles might have contacts who remained behind\n- The Ottomans themselves employ many Greeks, Italians, and others\n- This is very difficult but not impossible\n\n**France:**\n- Easier in some ways - Christian kingdom, shared language of diplomacy (Latin), trade connections\n- But France is hostile to Castilian/Aragonese interests\n- Converso networks exist there too\n- Merchants, clergy, minor nobles who can be cultivated\n- The Papal curia has French factions that can be monitored\n\nIsaac should be honest about timelines - this takes years, not months. And he'll need money and people.\n\nLet me write a response where Isaac is realistic but committed to trying.\n\n\nIsaac's expression flickers at the word invincible—a shadow of concern quickly suppressed. He files it away. A spymaster remembers everything.\n\n\n\"I can. But Your Majesty must understand the scale of what you ask.\"\n\n\nHe moves to the table and, without asking permission, takes a piece of parchment and a quill. He begins to sketch as he speaks—a rough map of the Mediterranean, marking points.\n\n\n\"The Ottoman court is in Edirne. The Sultan surrounds himself with men who have risen through the devshirme—Christian boys taken as children, converted, trained, loyal only to him. They speak Turkish, think Turkish, are Turkish in all but blood. Infiltrating this inner circle is nearly impossible for a Latin.\"\n\n\nHe marks a point.\n\n\n\"But the Ottomans are not only Turks. They employ Greeks—administrators, translators, merchants who know the old Byzantine trade routes. They employ Venetians and Genoese who value profit over faith. They employ Jews expelled from Christian lands who remember why they were expelled.\"\n\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\n\"The converso networks I spoke of—they extend into Ottoman territory. Not directly, but through cousins, through trading partners, through the Sephardic communities in Thessaloniki and Constantinople. These people have no love for the Sultan, but they have less love for Christian kings who burned their grandparents. Still... money talks. Information flows along trade routes. It can be done.\"\n\n\nHe marks another point—Paris.\n\n\n\"France is easier in some ways, harder in others. Easier because it is Christian, because merchants and clergy move freely, because the language of courts is Latin and French alike. Harder because the French are good at this game. They have played it for centuries. Their court leaks like a sieve, but so does everyone else's—and they watch for watchers.\"\n\n\nHe sets down the quill.\n\n\n\"For the Ottomans, I will need ten thousand florins and three years to build something reliable. I must place men in Venice first—the Venetians trade with everyone and hear everything. From there, connections into Ottoman territory. Greek exiles who still have family in the East. Jewish merchants who move freely where Christians cannot.\"\n\n\n\"For France, five thousand florins and two years. I will cultivate contacts in the Papal curia—the French faction there is large and quarrelsome, and quarrelsome men talk. I will find Castilian merchants who trade in Bordeaux and Marseille. I will identify minor French nobles who are ambitious and poor—the most useful combination.\"\n\n\nHe meets Juan's eyes.\n\n\n\"In the meantime, you will be blind at Tenedos. The Sultan will know things about you that you do not know about him. I can do nothing about this before spring.\"\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\"Unless...\"\n\n\nHe hesitates, as if weighing whether to speak.\n\n\n\"There is one faster path into Ottoman intelligence. Dangerous, but faster.\"\n\n\n\nIsaac waits to see if Juan wishes to hear it."

I need to think about what this could be - something that fits Isaac's character as a converso with networks, and something that would realistically provide faster intelligence on the Ottomans.\n\nPossible options:\n1. Using the Byzantine exiles already in Constantinople - but Juan already has connections there\n2. Approaching Ottoman defectors or disgruntled officials\n3. Using Jewish/converso networks more aggressively\n4. Contacting someone already embedded in Ottoman territory\n5. Making a deal with Venice or Genoa for intelligence sharing\n6. Using Commander Martín's Morocco mission as a back channel to the Islamic world\n7. Approaching someone in the Sultan's own court - perhaps someone who has reason to want the meeting at Tenedos to go a certain way\n\nGiven Isaac's background as a converso with extensive networks, and the historical reality that Jewish communities maintained connections across religious boundaries, the most realistic \"dangerous but faster\" path would likely involve:\n\n- Using Sephardic Jewish networks that extend into Ottoman territory\n- These networks exist because Jews expelled from various Christian kingdoms fled to Ottoman lands where they were more tolerated\n- The danger is that this involves working with people who have good reason to resent Christian kings\n- It could also expose the networks to scrutiny from the Inquisition that Juan just commissioned\n\nThis creates a beautiful tension - Juan just set Torquemada loose to hunt conversos, and now Isaac is proposing to use converso/Jewish networks for intelligence. This is exactly the contradiction Isaac warned about.\n\nLet me write Isaac presenting this option with appropriate gravity and tension.\n\n\nIsaac's jaw tightens. He glances toward the door—an automatic gesture, ensuring they are truly alone.\n\n\n\"What I am about to tell you could cost me my life if it reached the wrong ears. Including Fray Tomás's ears.\"\n\n\nHe moves closer, his voice dropping.\n\n\n\"You know that Jews were expelled from France, from England, from many Christian lands over the past two centuries. You know that many converted here in Castile—some sincerely, some not. But do you know where the ones who refused conversion went?\"\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\"The Ottoman Sultan welcomes them. Bayezid—Murad's grandfather—said that Ferdinand of Aragón impoverished his own lands and enriched the Ottoman realm by expelling the Jews. They settle in Thessaloniki, in Edirne, in Constantinople itself. They serve as physicians to the Sultan. As translators. As merchants who understand both worlds.\"\n\n\nIsaac's eyes are hard.\n\n\n\"They remember why they fled, Your Majesty. They remember the burnings, the confiscations, the forced conversions. They have no love for Christian kings.\"\n\n\nHe lets that settle.\n\n\n\"But they are not monolithic. Some fled with wealth and rebuilt. Others arrived with nothing and still have nothing. Some have risen high in Ottoman service and are loyal to the Sultan. Others serve him only because they must, and would serve another master if the price were right.\"\n\n\nHe takes a breath.\n\n\n\"I have a cousin. We have not spoken in twelve years—not since my family converted and his refused. He fled to Thessaloniki. Last I heard, he serves as a translator for Ottoman merchants who deal with Venice.\"\n\n\nIsaac meets Juan's eyes.\n\n\n\"If I reach out to him, I may be able to establish a channel into the Ottoman world within months, not years. He knows people. He hears things. And he has reason to help me—not for love of Castile, but for love of family, and perhaps for gold.\"\n\n\nHis voice hardens.\n\n\n\"But there is danger. If the Dominicans learn I am corresponding with unconverted Jews in Ottoman lands, they will ask questions. If my cousin is discovered by Ottoman agents, he dies—and the channel dies with him. And if your enemies learn you are using Jewish networks for intelligence while simultaneously unleashing the Inquisition...\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"They will use it against you. The King of Castile burns Jews with one hand and pays them with the other. It would be whispered in every court in Christendom.\"\n\n\nA long pause.\n\n\n\"The choice is yours, Your Majesty. The slow path is safer but leaves you blind at Tenedos. The fast path gives you eyes in the Ottoman world but plants a seed that could grow into scandal—or worse.\"\n\n\n\nIsaac waits, watching Juan with an expression that reveals nothing."

He wants intelligence, but he wants to maintain his reputation for honor. He's drawing a line between:\n\n1. Espionage that could compromise his reputation (using unconverted Jews, blackmail, etc.)\n2. Legitimate intelligence gathering (watching troop movements, understanding political situations)\n3. Open diplomacy with potential rivals like France\n\nHe's essentially asking Isaac to adapt his methods to fit within the constraints of Juan's honorable reputation. This is a reasonable request - there's a difference between having spies and being known as a dishonorable schemer.\n\nIsaac should respond thoughtfully. He's a pragmatist who thinks in shadows, but he was drawn to Juan precisely because Juan is different from other rulers. He should acknowledge Juan's position while offering practical ways to gather intelligence that don't compromise Juan's honor.\n\nKey points Isaac might make:\n- Observing troop movements and supplies is just prudent statecraft, not dishonorable\n- Having ambassadors and trade representatives who report back is normal\n- Understanding Ottoman internal politics through Greek refugees and merchants who openly fled to the West is not the same as using secret networks of unconverted Jews\n- France should indeed be handled openly - ambassadors, trade negotiations, perhaps even a marriage alliance to keep them close\n- The distinction Juan is drawing is wise - a king known for honor but who also isn't naive\n\nIsaac should also probably express some relief or approval - Juan is being wise rather than just idealistic.

They hate the Turks with a passion Christians can barely imagine.\"\n\n\n\"I can cultivate these exiles openly.

This is not espionage—it is listening to men who wish to be heard.\"\n\n\nA second finger.\n\n\n\"Trade networks. Venetian and Genoese merchants do business in Ottoman ports. They watch the dockyards. They count ships. They notice when grain prices rise because the army is buying. A Castilian trade representative in Venice—an official position, entirely legitimate—can gather this information simply by drinking wine with the right people.\"\n\n\nA third finger.\n\n\n\"The Military Orders. Your knights hold Constantinople now. They watch the Ottoman border daily. Formalize this. Require regular reports—not secret intelligence, but military assessments. Troop movements observed. Fortifications built. Ships counted in the Dardanelles. This is what soldiers do.\"\n\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\n\"As for France...\"\n\n\nIsaac's expression shifts—something like approval.\n\n\n\"Open diplomacy is wise.

Defense and offense in balance. Juan discovers he thinks better with a shield on his arm—more patient, more deliberate, more controlled.\n31-40\nPoleaxe. The weapon of judicial duels and armored combat. Shorter than a polearm, more versatile than a hammer. The spike, the blade, the hammer-head—three weapons in one.\n41-50\nMace. Not the hammer, but its cousin. Shorter, faster, more forgiving of imperfect technique. Juan's strength translates directly into crushing power.\n51-60\nMounted Sword. Fighting from horseback with blade in hand. The height advantage, the slashing angles, the mobility. Juan moves like water on horseback.\n61-70\nArming Sword (One-handed). Speed over power. Juan discovers he is faster than he thought—quick cuts, rapid transitions, a style built on not being where the enemy strikes.\n71-80\nPollaxe and Dagger (Armored Combat). The brutal close-quarters style of knights in full harness. Grappling, half-swording, finding gaps in armor. Technical, vicious, effective.\n81-90\nJinete Style (Light Cavalry). The Iberian way—lighter armor, faster horses, javelin and sword. Skirmishing, feinting, the warfare of the Reconquista.\n91-100\nEstoc/Tuck (Thrusting Sword). A weapon designed to kill armored men. No edge, all point. Juan discovers a gift for the precise, penetrating thrust.\n\n\nShall I roll?"

It's a versatile weapon used in armored combat and judicial duels, combining a hammer head, an axe blade, and a spike. It requires technique and leverage rather than pure brute strength, which might explain why Juan struggled with the hammer (which is more about raw power delivery) but finds the poleaxe more natural.\n\nLet me write a scene where Juan discovers this aptitude.\n\n\nThe discovery comes on a grey November morning.\n\n\nSancho de Ávila has grown weary of watching Juan struggle with the hammer. He sends for a weapons rack from the armory—a collection of tools for killing men in armor. Longswords. Maces. Halberds. And leaning in the corner, almost an afterthought, a poleaxe.\n\n\nJuan has seen poleaxes before. Knights use them in judicial duels, in the brutal close-quarters work of storming fortifications. A weapon of perhaps five feet—shorter than a halberd, longer than a sword. Three killing surfaces: a hammer head on one side, an axe blade on the other, a spike at the top.\n\n\n\"Try this,\" Sancho says, handing it to him. \"Different balance than the hammer. More... forgiving.\"\n\n\nJuan takes it. The weight is similar to the hammer, but distributed differently. When he moves it, the weapon flows rather than fights him.\n\n\nHe strikes the training post. The axe blade bites deep.\n\n\nHe reverses, brings the hammer head around. The impact thunders through the wood.\n\n\nHe thrusts with the spike. The point drives true.\n\n\nSancho watches, saying nothing. But his silence is different now—attentive rather than patient.\n\n\nThey train for three hours that day. Then four hours the next. By the end of the week, Juan's shoulders ache in a good way—the ache of muscles being used as they were meant to be used.\n\n\n\n\"The poleaxe suits you, Your Majesty,\" Sancho says one evening, watching Juan work through the guards and transitions. \"The hammer demands you become a different man. The poleaxe...\" He pauses, searching for words. \"It meets you where you are. Rewards what you already have—balance, timing, intelligence.\"\n\n\nHe spits to the side.\n\n\n\"Any fool can swing a hammer. The poleaxe requires thinking. You must choose—spike, blade, or hammer—in the space of a heartbeat. It is a weapon for a man with a general's mind.\"\n\n\n\nWinter continues. Juan has found his weapon.

The term itself became synonymous with fine leather. The guadamecí (gilded leather) was used for wall hangings, furniture, and decorative items. The industry was heavily influenced by Moorish techniques.\n\nI should have Rodrigo de Montilla explain:\n1. What they produce (types of leather goods)\n2. Current export markets\n3. Challenges to expansion\n4. What support would help\n\nThis should be realistic and grounded in actual medieval economics - labor, materials, guild structures, trade routes, etc.\n\n\nRodrigo's eyes light up. A king who asks questions about trade rather than simply demanding taxes—this is new.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty honors us with such interest.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to his clerk, who opens a ledger, though Rodrigo barely glances at it.

Fine goatskin, tanned with sumac—a technique the Moors perfected and we inherited. Supple, durable, beautiful. This goes to bootmakers, saddlers, bookbinders, glovers across Christendom. Demand exceeds what we can supply. A Córdoban boot in Paris fetches three times what a local boot commands.\"\n\n\nA second finger.\n\n\n\"Guadamecí. Gilded and painted leather panels for wall hangings, altar frontals, furniture covering, screens. Art as much as craft. Each piece takes weeks. The great houses of Italy, the cathedrals of France—they pay extraordinary sums. But production is slow. A master and two apprentices might complete twenty panels in a year.\"\n\n\nA third finger.\n\n\n\"Military leather. Saddles, scabbards, armor straps, belts, harnesses. Less glamorous, but endless demand—especially now that Your Majesty has conquered Granada and maintains armies in distant lands.\" A knowing look. \"Soldiers wear through leather faster than they wear through steel.\"\n\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\n\"As for increasing production...\" He hesitates, glancing at his companions. \"Here we encounter difficulties, Majesty.\"\n\n\n\"First: Hides. We depend on goats from the Sierra Morena and sheep from the Mesta. Supply is... adequate, but if we doubled our workshops, we would run short within a year. More herds, more grazing rights, more animals slaughtered for skin rather than meat alone.\"\n\n\n\"Second: Sumac. The tanning agent that makes cordobán what it is. It grows wild in the hills, but inconsistently. We have never cultivated it deliberately. Perhaps we should.\"\n\n\n\"Third: Masters. A tanner trains for seven years before he can work unsupervised. A guadamecí artist, longer still. We cannot simply hire more hands—we must grow them. The guild limits apprenticeships to maintain quality. Perhaps...\" He treads carefully. \"Perhaps those limits could be... reconsidered, if the crown wished to encourage expansion.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth: Space. Tanning stinks, Majesty. Forgive my bluntness. The vats, the dung, the urine, the rotting flesh we scrape from hides—no one wants a tannery near their home. Córdoba's tanners are pushed to the riverbank, crowded together. More workshops require more space, and the city fathers resist.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"Give us hides, sumac, apprentices, and room to work—and Córdoba can clothe half of Christendom in leather. But these things require... intervention. Coordination. The guild alone cannot command grazing rights or overrule city councils.\"\n\n\nHe bows his head.\n\n\n\"What would Your Majesty propose?\"\n\n\n\nJuan may respond or hear from the other delegations first."

Juan is cleverly identifying that this high-value artistic work could be separated from the tanning and done in the city, potentially increasing production of the most valuable goods.\n\nThis is a smart insight - the artistic finishing work doesn't stink, so it can be done in more desirable locations, potentially attracting more artisans and increasing output of the highest-margin products.\n\nRodrigo should respond to this with appreciation for the insight.\n\n\nRodrigo's eyebrows rise.

We catch them in vast numbers during the summer runs, salt them in barrels, ship them across Christendom. Fast days and Lent create endless demand—the Church has made us wealthy.\" A thin smile. \"Third: bacalao—the salted cod. This we do not catch ourselves.

This was common in Mediterranean and Atlantic coastal areas.\n\n2. **Rock salt / Salt mines** - In some places, there are actual deposits of rock salt (halite) underground that can be mined. Famous medieval salt mines included those in Salzburg (Austria - the name literally means \"salt fortress\"), Wieliczka (Poland), and various locations in Germany.\n\n3. **Salt springs / Brine springs** - Natural springs where water passes through salt deposits and emerges salty. The brine is then evaporated (often by boiling) to produce salt. Common in central Europe.\n\n4. **Salt lakes and salt flats** - Places like the Dead Sea, or salt flats where salt literally lies on the surface after water evaporates. The Sahara has salt deposits that were traded across the desert.\n\n5. **African salt** - The famous trans-Saharan trade included salt from places like Taghaza and Taoudenni in the Sahara, where salt was so abundant it was cut into blocks. This salt was traded south for gold.\n\nThe Portuguese exploration along the African coast would indeed have been finding new sources of salt - the West African coast has various salt-producing areas.\n\nFor the merchant to answer realistically, he would know about:\n- Sea salt production (their main method)\n- Possibly rock salt from trade knowledge\n- The African salt trade rumors from Portuguese activities\n- Salt springs in other parts of Europe\n\nLet me have Alonso and Gonzalo explain this in a historically accurate way.\n\n\nAlonso and Gonzalo exchange glances.

      "say": "Thought process: Contextualized historical exploration opportunities and Castilian competitive positioning.\n\nThe player is asking excellent questions about Atlantic exploration, fishing rights, African coast, and potential colonies. This is historically very interesting territory - we're in 1434, right around the time Portugal is pushing past Cape Bojador under Prince Henry the Navigator.\n\nLet me think about what Gonzalo and Alonso would know:\n\n1. Atlantic cod fishing - historically this was dominated by Basques, Portuguese, and later English. The rich fishing grounds are in the north (Grand Banks, Iceland, etc.) not off Africa. The Basques were fishing cod in the North Atlantic for centuries.\n\n2. African coast - Portugal has been aggressively exploring under Prince Henry. Cape Bojador was passed in 1434 (this very year!). The Canary Islands are contested between Castile and Portugal - this is actually a key point. Castile has claims to the Canaries.\n\n3. Colonies - this is very early for the concept as we'd later understand it. The Canaries are being colonized/conquered. Madeira was discovered by Portugal around 1419. The Azores were being settled by Portugal in the 1430s.\n\n4. Salt from Africa - there were indeed major salt sources in the Sahara, traded across caravan routes (like from Taghaza). The Portuguese were seeking sea routes to bypass these caravan routes.\n\nThe merchants would know:\n- Castile has claims to the Canary Islands (contested with Portugal)\n- The Basques know the northern fishing grounds\n- Portugal is ahead in Atlantic exploration\n- The African coast is largely unknown to Castilians\n\nThis is a great opportunity for the player to potentially change history by investing in Atlantic exploration - something Castile historically neglected until Columbus.\n\n\nGonzalo's face lights up—this is clearly a subject close to his heart. But it's Alonso who speaks first, the factor's mind already calculating.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the questions that keep us awake at night.\"\n\n\nHe steps forward, organizing his thoughts.\n\n\n\"The cod. The great cod fisheries lie far to the north—cold waters off Iceland, beyond Ireland, perhaps even further.\" He glances at Gonzalo. \"The Basques know these waters. They have fished them for generations, jealously guarding their knowledge. They will not share their charts, their routes, their secrets. When we buy bacalao from them, we buy it at their price.\"\n\n\nGonzalo cuts in, unable to restrain himself.\n\n\n\"Our boats are too small, Majesty. Coastal vessels, built for sardines and short voyages. The northern waters require ships that can stay at sea for months, survive Atlantic storms, carry enough salt to preserve the catch. We do not build such ships. We do not train such sailors.\"\n\n\nHe hesitates, then continues.\n\n\n\"The Basques are Your Majesty's subjects too—nominally. But they guard their privileges. Their fueros. They answer to no one when it comes to the sea.\"\n\n\nAlonso nods, returning to the thread.\n\n\n\"The African coast. This is where opportunity lies—and where we are losing ground daily.\"\n\n\nHe ticks off points on his fingers.\n\n\n\"The Canary Islands. Castile claims them, Majesty. Your predecessors asserted rights decades ago. But what have we done with this claim? A few missionaries. A handful of adventurers who raid for slaves and withdraw. Meanwhile, the natives—the Guanches—remain unconquered. The islands remain undeveloped.\"\n\n\nHis voice sharpens.\n\n\n\"Portugal looks at our Canaries and sees weakness. They have taken Madeira. They have taken the Azores. They are pushing south past Cape Bojador this very year, into waters no Christian ship has sailed. They establish feitorias—trading posts—wherever they land. They claim everything.\"\n\n\nGonzalo spits again—then catches himself with a guilty look.\n\n\n\"Forgive me, Majesty. But it burns. The Atlantic is there.\" He gestures westward. \"Fish. Salt. Gold. Whatever lies beyond. And we sit in Seville, salting sardines, while the Portuguese inherit the ocean.\"\n\n\nAlonso speaks carefully now, clearly weighing how bold to be.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty asks about colonies. The word is... new. But the concept is old. The Venetians have their trading posts throughout the East. The Genoese have theirs. Portugal builds them now along the African coast.\"\n\n\nHe meets Juan's eyes.\n\n\n\"If Castile wished to compete, we would need three things. First: Ships. Real ships, ocean-going ships, built in numbers. Second: The Canaries—conquered, settled, developed as a base for further exploration. Third: Royal commitment. Not adventurers seeking quick profit, but sustained investment over years, decades, with the crown's full backing.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"This would be expensive, Majesty. And slow. Portugal has a generation's head start. But the Atlantic is vast. There is room enough—if we begin now.\"\n\n\nGonzalo adds quietly, \"They say Prince Henrique of Portugal—the one they call 'the Navigator'—spends every escudo he can find on ships and charts and expeditions. He has made exploration a... a crusade. A holy mission.\"\n\n\nHe looks at Juan.\n\n\n\"Castile has crusaded for Granada. Perhaps it is time to crusade for the sea?\"\n\n\n\nThe two men wait, watching the king who conquered an emirate—wondering if he sees the ocean as the next frontier."

This is a good opportunity for the salt and fish merchants to explain the economic potential.\n\nLet me think about what they would know and say:\n\n1. Atlantic fishing - there are indeed rich fishing grounds in the Atlantic. The waters off the African coast have fish. The Grand Banks off Newfoundland (though they don't know about this yet in 1434) are incredibly rich in cod.\n\n2. The Canary Islands area has good fishing - tuna, sardines, other species.\n\n3. The African coast has fish as well.\n\n4. The benefit would be:\n- More fish to salt and trade\n- Less dependence on buying from Basques and Portuguese\n- Control of their own supply chain\n- Access to new markets\n- Potential discovery of new resources (salt deposits, etc.)\n\n5. They should also mention that having their own fleet means they're not at the mercy of others for shipping their goods.\n\nLet me have Gonzalo and Alonso explain this in practical terms.\n\n\nGonzalo steps forward eagerly, the old sailor's eyes bright.\n\n\n\"Majesty, the Atlantic teems with fish. More than we can imagine.\"\n\n\nHe gestures expansively.\n\n\n\"Off our own coast—the waters between Castile and the Canaries—we know there are tuna. Great schools of them, migrating through the strait and northward. We catch what passes close to shore, but the deep-water schools? We cannot reach them. Our boats are too small, too fragile.\"\n\n\nHe warms to his subject.\n\n\n\"The Canary waters themselves—the old sailors speak of fish so thick you could walk upon their backs. Sardines, yes, but also larger prey. And the African coast beyond...\" He shakes his head. \"Who knows? No Castilian has fished those waters. The Portuguese guard them jealously, but they cannot guard what they have not yet claimed.\"\n\n\nAlonso steps in, translating the sailor's passion into merchant's logic.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, let me speak plainly about profit.\"\n\n\nHe ticks off fingers.\n\n\n\"First: Volume. Our coastal fisheries are limited. The sardine runs come and go. We harvest what we can, but we cannot grow beyond what the local waters provide. Atlantic fishing—true deep-water fishing—would multiply our catch many times over. More fish means more to salt, more to sell.\"\n\n\n\"Second: Independence. Today, we buy cod from the Basques. They set the price. If they decide to sell to Flanders instead, we have nothing. If Castile had its own fleet fishing northern waters—or discovered new fisheries off Africa—we control our own supply. We set our own prices.\"\n\n\n\"Third: The salt trade itself.\" He glances at Gonzalo. \"Every fish we catch requires salt to preserve. More fish means more demand for salt. The salinas expand. The trade grows. Fish and salt feed each other, Majesty—one hand washing the other.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth: Ships have multiple uses.\" His eyes sharpen. \"A fishing fleet is also a merchant fleet. The same vessel that carries salt fish to Italy can carry wool, leather, wine on the return voyage. And in time of war...\" He pauses delicately. \"Ships that fish in peacetime can do other work when called upon.\"\n\n\nGonzalo nods vigorously.\n\n\n\"The Portuguese understand this, Majesty. Prince Henrique's fishing vessels scout the coast. His merchant ships carry soldiers when needed. The sea is all one thing—fishing, trading, fighting, exploring. Build the fleet for one purpose, and you have it for all purposes.\"\n\n\nAlonso delivers the conclusion.\n\n\n\"To answer Your Majesty's question directly: if you invest in a fleet and find nothing along the African coast—no salt mountains, no gold, no new lands—you would still have the fleet. You would still have the fishing. You would still have ships to carry Castilian goods to Castilian markets, crewed by Castilian sailors, filling Castilian purses.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"The fleet pays for itself through fishing and trade. Everything else—the exploration, the colonies, the competition with Portugal—that is extra. That is empire. But the foundation is simple: fish, salt, ships, profit.\"\n\n\nGonzalo adds quietly, \"And Majesty... the Canaries. They sit there, claimed but unconquered. A ready-made base, halfway to Africa. If we do not use them, Portugal will find an excuse to take them. They are too valuable to leave empty.\"\n\n\n\nThe two men wait, watching the king process the weight of oceans."

This is a great question about medieval/early modern economic models. Let me think about how this would actually work historically.\n\nThere are several models:\n\n1. **Royal ownership, leased to fishermen** - The crown builds and owns the ships, leases them to fishing crews for a fee or a percentage of the catch. This keeps control with the crown but requires administration.\n\n2. **Subsidized purchase** - The crown builds ships and sells them to fishermen at reduced prices, or provides loans. The fishermen own the ships but owe the crown.\n\n3. **Guild/cofradía model** - The crown invests in the guild itself, which then owns and operates the ships collectively. Profits are shared according to guild rules.\n\n4. **Direct royal operation** - The crown owns and operates the ships directly, hiring crews as employees. This is expensive and requires heavy administration but keeps all profit with the crown.\n\n5. **Mixed model** - Some combination of the above.\n\nAlonso and Gonzalo would have opinions on this. They would probably favor a model that benefits them - either guild ownership or favorable lease terms. They might be wary of direct royal competition.\n\nLet me have them present the options and their preferences.\n\n\nAlonso and Gonzalo exchange a look—this is clearly a question they have debated among themselves.\n\n\nAlonso speaks first, the factor's mind already sorting through models.\n\n\n\"There are several ways this can work, Majesty. Each has merits and dangers.\"\n\n\nHe raises one finger.\n\n\n\"First: Royal fleet, royal crews. The crown builds the ships, hires the sailors, keeps the catch, sells it through royal agents. All profit flows to the treasury.\" He pauses. \"This is how Venice operates some of its galleys. But it requires enormous administration. Captains must be supervised. Catches must be counted. Corruption creeps in. Men fish harder for their own profit than for a distant king's wage.\"\n\n\nA second finger.\n\n\n\"Second: Royal ships, leased to fishermen. The crown builds the vessels and leases them to experienced captains for a fixed fee—or better, a share of the catch. Perhaps one-fifth, one-quarter. The fishermen keep the rest. They have reason to work hard, because more fish means more profit for them. The crown earns without administering.\"\n\n\nA third finger.\n\n\n\"Third: Subsidized purchase. The crown builds ships and sells them to fishermen at reduced cost, or lends the money at fair terms. The fishermen become owners, responsible for their own vessels. The crown recovers its investment over time and gains a larger fishing fleet without ongoing management.\"\n\n\nHe glances at Gonzalo, who steps forward.\n\n\n\"Majesty, I am a sailor, not a banker. But I know men.\"\n\n\nThe old fisherman speaks plainly.\n\n\n\"A man who owns his ship treats it like his child. He repairs every plank, guards every rope. A man who leases another's ship...\" He shrugs. \"He uses it hard, returns it worn, says not my problem. And a man who works for wages on a royal ship? He does the minimum. He hides fish in his shirt when no one watches. He has no stake.\"\n\n\nHe scratches his stubbled chin.\n\n\n\"The cofradía could manage this, Majesty. We know which captains are reliable, which crews work hard, which men drink their profits and which save them. If the crown built ships and leased them through the brotherhood—we would guarantee the payments, discipline the captains, ensure the vessels are maintained.\"\n\n\nAlonso nods slowly.\n\n\n\"A partnership, in other words. The crown provides what we cannot—capital for ships. The cofradía provides what the crown cannot—knowledge, experience, trusted men. We share the risk and share the reward.\"\n\n\nHe hesitates, then speaks more carefully.\n\n\n\"There is also the question of new fishermen, Majesty. Our brotherhood is not large. If you build fifty ships, we cannot crew them all with experienced men. We would need to train new sailors, attract men from other trades. This takes time. Perhaps... perhaps the crown begins with ten ships, leased through the cofradía. We prove the model works. Then twenty more. Then fifty.\"\n\n\nGonzalo adds quietly, \"And Majesty—the ships must be built right. Not river boats with bigger sails. True ocean vessels, designed by men who know Atlantic waters. The Basques build such ships. The Portuguese build them. We would need to learn from them—or hire their shipwrights.\"\n\n\n\nThey wait, watching to see which model appeals to the king."

Enough for coastal Atlantic work, short voyages to the Canaries, perhaps the near African coast.\"\n\n\n\"A proper deep-water ship—eighty to one hundred tons, the kind the Basques use for cod, the kind that can weather true Atlantic storms—three hundred to four hundred florins.

A ship without gear is just floating wood.\"\n\n\nAlonso nods.\n\n\n\"So to speak in round numbers: two hundred to two hundred fifty florins for a small ocean-going fishing ship, fully equipped. Three hundred fifty to five hundred for a larger vessel fit for the deep Atlantic.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, calculating.\n\n\n\"If Your Majesty wished to begin with ten ships—a mix of sizes—perhaps three thousand florins.

Juan has expressed that he wants to learn about the silk trade and how to improve production. I should have the silk merchants explain their trade, the challenges they face, and what opportunities exist - similar to how the leather and salt/fish delegations presented their industries.\n\nJosé de Granada is a converso silk craftsman who is nervous. Hernán de Úbeda is a Christian merchant who trades in silk. I need to present an authentic picture of the Granada silk industry in the 1430s.\n\nKey historical context:\n- Granada was famous for its silk production under Moorish rule\n- Silk production involves mulberry trees, silkworms, weaving\n- The conquest has disrupted the industry - many craftsmen fled\n- There's genuine fear among the Moorish population about their future\n- The silk trade connected to Italian markets especially\n\nI should present both the commercial perspective (Hernán) and the production perspective (José), highlighting:\n1. The current state of the industry (damaged by conquest, workers fleeing)\n2. What silk production requires (mulberry trees, silkworms, skilled weavers)\n3. The markets and demand\n4. What constraints exist\n5. What support would help\n\nI need to be historically authentic about the fear the conversos feel, especially given that Juan has just commissioned the Inquisition. There's a real tension here.\n\n\nJosé's shoulders relax slightly—though wariness remains in his eyes. He glances at Hernán, who nods for him to speak.\n\n\n\"Majesty, I will tell you what silk requires, and then perhaps you will understand our difficulties.\"\n\n\nHe speaks slowly, choosing his words with care.\n\n\n\"First: The mulberry trees. Silkworms eat nothing else. A single workshop requires hundreds of trees, carefully tended, their leaves harvested at precisely the right time. The trees of Granada are old—some planted by my great-grandfather. They cannot be replaced quickly. A new mulberry takes seven years before its leaves are suitable.\"\n\n\nHe holds up calloused hands.\n\n\n\"Second: The worms themselves. We raise them from eggs, keep them warm, feed them constantly for weeks. They are delicate. Too cold, they die. Too hot, they die. Wrong leaves, they die. Disease spreads through a workshop like fire. A skilled worker knows the worms—knows their sounds, their movements, when they are ready to spin.\"\n\n\n\"Third: The reeling. When the worm spins its cocoon, we must unwind the thread before the moth emerges and breaks it. This requires boiling the cocoons, finding the thread's end, winding it onto reels without breaking. One cocoon yields perhaps a thousand feet of thread, thin as a hair. It takes patience. Skill. Years of practice.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth: The weaving. The thread becomes cloth on looms built for silk alone—different from wool looms, different from linen. Our weavers know patterns passed from father to son. Damascus patterns. Granada patterns. Designs the Italians pay fortunes to possess.\"\n\n\nHe lowers his hands.\n\n\n\"This is what we had, Majesty. Before.\"\n\n\nHernán steps forward, the merchant's voice harder.\n\n\n\"What remains is perhaps half of what existed. When the siege began, families fled—to Africa, to the mountains, anywhere they thought safe. They took their knowledge with them. Workshops stand empty. Looms gather dust. Mulberry groves go untended because the men who tended them are gone.\"\n\n\nJosé speaks quietly.\n\n\n\"Those who stayed... we converted. We took baptism. We believed Your Majesty's promises of protection.\" He hesitates. \"But now we hear rumors. Dominicans in the streets. Talk of investigation. My cousin's neighbor was questioned last week about whether he eats pork.\"\n\n\nHis voice drops almost to a whisper.\n\n\n\"How can we work, Majesty, when we do not know if we will be arrested tomorrow? How can we train apprentices when families tell their sons to learn other trades—trades that do not mark them as Moorish? The silk workers of Granada are not fleeing your armies anymore. They are fleeing your priests.\"\n\n\nHernán interjects quickly, smoothing over the moment.\n\n\n\"What José means, Majesty, is that confidence is required for investment. A man will not plant mulberry trees that take seven years to mature if he fears he will not be here to harvest them. The silk trade requires stability.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"The demand exists. Italy cannot get enough Granada silk. France pays premium prices. Even the Ottoman court—\" he catches himself, \"—that is, before recent events—purchased our finest weaves. The markets are there. The trees are there. The looms are there.\"\n\n\n\"What is missing is the people, Majesty. And the belief that they have a future.\"\n\n\n\nBoth men wait, José with barely concealed fear, Hernán with a merchant's cautious hope."

Mulberry trees (take 7 years to mature)\n2. Silkworms (delicate, require skill)\n3. Reeling (unwinding cocoons)\n4. Weaving (specialized looms, patterns)\n\nOpportunities for growth might include:\n- Planting more mulberry trees\n- Training more workers\n- Expanding weaving workshops\n- Opening new markets\n- Improving quality/variety\n\nConstraints:\n- Mulberry trees take time to mature\n- Skilled labor is specialized\n- Competition from Italian silk (Lucca, Florence, Venice)\n- Trade routes and market access\n\n\nHernán nods, visibly relieved that the king's mind turns to growth rather than suspicion.\n\n\n\"Then let me explain what we have and what limits us, Majesty.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to Yusef, who begins to speak, with Hernán translating and expanding.\n\n\n\"The mulberry groves. Granada's silk begins here. The Vega—the fertile plain below the city—holds perhaps ten thousand trees, some a century old. They produce enough leaves to feed the worms for our current production. But no more.\" Hernán adds: \"To increase production, we must plant more trees. And a mulberry takes seven years before its leaves are suitable for silkworms. This is the first constraint—time.\"\n\n\nYusef holds up two fingers, speaking slowly.\n\n\n\"The workers. Silk is... sabr.\" He searches for the word. \"Patience. Skill. My son learns from me. His son will learn from him. Cannot make silk worker in one year, two year. Takes...\" He confers with Hernán.\n\n\n\"A generation,\" Hernán supplies. \"The skills pass within families. This is the second constraint—we cannot simply hire more hands. We must grow them.\"\n\n\n\"The looms.\" Yusef mimes weaving. \"Granada has perhaps two hundred looms for silk. Good looms. Old looms. Some broken in war, most...\" He makes a balancing gesture. \"Still work. But for more silk, need more looms.

Perhaps forty to fifty florins for a proper one. And a weaver to operate it—trained, skilled, patient.\"\n\n\nHernán steps forward now, the merchant taking over.\n\n\n\"The markets. This is where opportunity lies, Majesty. Granada silk has always sold well in Italy—but through Genoese middlemen.

We do the work; they take the profit.\"\n\n\nHis jaw tightens.\n\n\n\"With Your Majesty's new alliances—Aragón, Naples—we could sell directly to Italian buyers. Cut out the Genoese. Triple our margins without producing a single additional bolt of cloth.\"\n\n\nYusef speaks again, and Hernán translates.\n\n\n\"There is also the matter of what we produce. Raw silk thread fetches one price. Woven cloth fetches five times more. Dyed and patterned cloth—the famous Granada brocades—ten times more.\" Yusef touches his own robe, showing the intricate pattern. \"We sell too much thread, not enough cloth. The Italians buy our thread, weave it themselves, sell the cloth back to us.\"\n\n\nHernán nods emphatically.\n\n\n\"If we expanded weaving capacity—more looms, more weavers—we could capture that value here in Castile.

Security. Promise that silk workers—Muslim and Christian—will be left to work in peace. That our groves will not be seized, our looms not confiscated.

Let me think about what would be historically accurate here.\n\nGranada's silk industry was indeed famous, particularly for its brocades and fine woven goods. The Moorish craftsmen would have had expertise in:\n- Raising silkworms\n- Reeling silk thread\n- Weaving silk cloth\n- Creating brocades (silk woven with gold or silver thread)\n- Dyeing\n\nHowever, there's a difference between weaving cloth and making finished garments. Tailoring is a separate trade. \n\nAlso, the Italian silk industry (Florence, Lucca, Venice) was extremely advanced and competitive. They had guild structures, specialized dyers, and access to rare dyes.\n\nLet me have the NPCs respond realistically to Juan's questions.\n\n\nYusef's face lights up at the question. He speaks rapidly in Arabic, then catches himself and switches to halting Castilian, gesturing emphatically.\n\n\n\"Brocade—yes, yes. This is what we do. Granada brocade is...\" He kisses his fingers. \"Famous. Gold thread, silver thread, woven with silk. The patterns—\" He traces invisible designs in the air. \"Passed from father to son. The Italians, they copy us, Majesty. They learn from us.\"\n\n\nHernán elaborates.\n\n\n\"Yusef speaks truth. Granada's weavers have been making brocades for centuries. The Alhambra itself is draped in their work. This expertise did not flee—the master weavers are still here, still working. We can produce brocade now, today, if there is demand.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, thinking through the rest of Juan's question.\n\n\n\"Cloth—absolutely. We weave silk cloth of various grades. Plain silk, patterned silk, damask. The looms exist, the skills exist. What we lack is volume—enough looms and trained weavers to meet Italian demand. But this can be grown.\"\n\n\nYusef confers quietly with Hernán, then the merchant continues more carefully.\n\n\n\"Finished garments... this is different, Majesty. Weaving cloth and tailoring clothes are separate trades. A weaver makes the fabric. A tailor cuts and sews the garment. Granada has tailors, yes—but they serve local customers. They are not organized for large-scale production.\"\n\n\nHe strokes his chin.\n\n\n\"However... if Your Majesty wished to establish such a trade, the foundation is there. Skilled seamstresses, embroiderers—Granada's women have always done fine needlework. What is lacking is organization. Someone to coordinate: the weavers produce the cloth, the dyers color it, the tailors cut it, the embroiderers finish it. A... a manufactory, perhaps. All under one roof.\"\n\n\nYusef speaks again, and Hernán translates.\n\n\n\"Yusef says the Moors had such arrangements in the old days. Workshops where thread entered one door and finished robes left through another. The knowledge is not lost. But it requires...\"\n\n\nHe rubs his thumb against his fingers.\n\n\n\"Investment. And trust. Someone must pay for the building, the looms, the workers—before the first garment is sold.\"\n\n\nHernán summarizes:\n\n\n\"What we can do now: Brocades, woven cloth, patterned silk—immediately, with existing capacity.\n\n\nWhat we can grow quickly: More looms, more weavers, higher volume—within two to three years, with investment in equipment and training.\n\n\nWhat requires building: A true garment manufactory, producing finished clothes for export—perhaps five years to establish properly, but the expertise exists to do it.\"\n\n\nHe looks at Juan directly.\n\n\n\"Where would Your Majesty like us to begin?\"\n\n\n\nThe two men wait, sensing opportunity."

They're asking about the investment needed to expand weaving capacity to process all the silk thread Granada produces into cloth.\n\nLet me think about this realistically:\n- Granada currently produces silk thread\n- Some is woven into cloth locally, some sold as raw thread\n- To weave ALL thread into cloth would require significant expansion of looms and weavers\n- Looms cost 40-50 florins each\n- Weavers take time to train\n- The question is: how much investment to reach the point where all thread becomes cloth?\n\nI should have Hernán and Yusef calculate this out for the king.\n\n\nHernán and Yusef confer quietly, the merchant scribbling figures on his palm with a finger while the craftsman counts on his hands.\n\n\nAfter a moment, Hernán speaks.\n\n\n\"Majesty, let me explain the current situation, then the gap we must bridge.\"\n\n\nHe organizes his thoughts.\n\n\n\"Granada currently produces enough silk thread to fill perhaps three hundred bolts of cloth per year—if all of it were woven. But we have only enough looms and weavers to produce perhaps one hundred eighty, two hundred bolts. The rest—roughly one third of our thread—we sell raw to the Genoese, who weave it themselves and keep the profit.\"\n\n\nHe holds up fingers.\n\n\n\"To weave all our thread into cloth, we need approximately fifty additional looms. At forty to fifty florins each—call it forty-five on average—that is two thousand two hundred fifty florins for the looms alone.\"\n\n\nYusef speaks, and Hernán translates.\n\n\n\"But a loom without a weaver is just wood and string. Each loom requires a trained weaver. Training takes three years for basic competence, five for mastery. We cannot conjure fifty skilled weavers from nothing.\"\n\n\nHernán nods.\n\n\n\"However—Yusef suggests a solution. There are weavers in Granada who currently work wool or linen. Silk is more demanding, but the fundamentals are similar. If we offer better wages, some will convert to silk weaving. They will need supervision, retraining—perhaps one master silk weaver overseeing four or five former wool weavers until they gain proficiency.\"\n\n\nHe calculates further.\n\n\n\"For wages during the training period—paying men to learn rather than produce—perhaps five hundred florins spread over the first two years. Plus hiring additional master weavers to supervise, another three hundred florins per year.\"\n\n\nYusef adds something, and Hernán translates carefully.\n\n\n\"There is also the matter of dyes. Cloth sells for more than thread, but dyed cloth sells for more still. Granada has dyers—good ones—but their workshops are small. To dye all the cloth we would produce, we need to expand their capacity. Vats, mordants, the dyes themselves—five hundred florins to properly equip them.\"\n\n\nHernán summarizes:\n\n\n\"Initial investment:\n\n\nFifty looms: 2,250 florins\n\nTraining wages: 500 florins\n\nMaster weaver supervision: 300 florins per year\n\nDye workshop expansion: 500 florins\n\n\nTotal to begin: approximately 3,550 florins, with ongoing costs of perhaps 300 to 400 florins yearly until the new weavers reach full proficiency.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"Within three years, Majesty, every thread Granada produces could become Granadan cloth, sold directly to Italian and Castilian buyers at three to five times the price of raw silk. The investment repays itself within two years of full operation—then pure profit thereafter.\"\n\n\nYusef speaks one more time, and Hernán smiles as he translates.\n\n\n\"Yusef says: give us looms and workers, and we will dress the courts of Europe in Granada silk. The Italians will weep.\"\n\n\n\nBoth men wait, hope evident in their faces."

He looks uncomfortable in the palace, but his jaw is set with determination.\n\n\nDon Alonso bows with practiced elegance.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty. The Mesta is honored by your summons.

Both compete for grazing land\n2. The Mesta has royal privileges that often override local rights\n3. Goatherds are less politically powerful\n\nTo increase production by 50%, they would need:\n- More animals (breeding programs, imports)\n- More grazing land (this is the conflict point)\n- Better management of existing resources\n- Possibly reducing other land uses (agriculture)\n\nDon Alonso would likely emphasize Mesta privileges and the wool trade's importance.\nMartín would likely advocate for goatherds getting fair access to grazing.\n\nLet me write this scene with realistic tension between the two groups.\n\n\nDon Alonso and Martín exchange a glance—the first acknowledgment that they share this audience. The tension between them shifts slightly; now they face a common question.\n\n\nDon Alonso speaks first, as befits his station.\n\n\n\"Majesty, the Mesta currently manages perhaps three million sheep across Castile. To increase by half—another million and a half animals—is no small matter.\"\n\n\nHe raises one finger.\n\n\n\"First: Grazing land. Sheep eat. A flock of a thousand requires vast pastures, and our flocks walk hundreds of leagues each year, following the grass. The cañadas reales—the drove roads—are fixed by ancient law. To increase flocks, we need either wider roads or new pastures at each end.\"\n\n\nA second finger.\n\n\n\"Second: Water. Sheep drink. The watering points along the cañadas are already crowded during migration. More animals means more wells, more access to rivers, more infrastructure.\"\n\n\nA third finger.\n\n\n\"Third: The breeding itself. A ewe produces one lamb per year, sometimes two. To grow the flocks by half requires years of retained breeding stock—ewes kept for lambs rather than slaughtered for meat or sold for wool. Five years, perhaps seven, to achieve such growth naturally.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, choosing his next words carefully.\n\n\n\"And fourth, Majesty... there is the matter of competition.\"\n\n\nHe glances at Martín.\n\n\n\"Grazing land is not infinite.

The hill country serves both—but not both in greater numbers.\"\n\n\nMartín stiffens but holds his tongue, waiting for his turn.\n\n\nDon Alonso continues smoothly.\n\n\n\"The Mesta's privileges—granted by Your Majesty's predecessors—give our flocks priority on the drove roads and common pastures. These privileges exist because wool is Castile's greatest export. The trade with Flanders alone...\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"I do not say the goatherds have no place. But if we are to increase production, Majesty must decide: wool or hides? Sheep or goats? The land cannot support both at the scale you describe.\"\n\n\n\nMartín Sánchez de Priego speaks now, his voice rougher but no less determined.\n\n\n\"Majesty, with respect to Don Alonso—the Mesta speaks as if all Castile belongs to sheep.\"\n\n\nHe steps forward.\n\n\n\"The goatherds work land the sheep cannot use. The steep hills, the rocky slopes, the scrubland too poor for wool-fat sheep. Our goats thrive where sheep would starve. We do not compete—we complement.\"\n\n\nHe holds up his own weathered hands.\n\n\n\"To increase goat production by half—more hides for Córdoba, more meat for your armies, more milk and cheese for your people—we need three things.\"\n\n\n\"First: Recognition. The Mesta has royal charters. We have nothing. When disputes arise, the Mesta wins—always. Our herds are pushed to poorer and poorer ground. Give us legal standing, Majesty, and we can plan, invest, grow.\"\n\n\n\"Second: Access to markets. We sell locally because we have no organization to sell widely. The Mesta has agents in Burgos, in Bilbao, in Bruges. We have... ourselves. Help us organize, and our hides will flow to Córdoba's tanners in the quantities they need.\"\n\n\n\"Third: Grazing rights in Granada.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, letting the word settle.\n\n\n\"The Moors are gone, Majesty. The Sierra Nevada, the Alpujarras—hill country perfect for goats, barely touched. The Mesta's sheep walk the plains. Let the goatherds have the mountains. There is room enough for both, if we are not forced to share the same ground.\"\n\n\nHe glances at Don Alonso.\n\n\n\"I do not ask to take what the Mesta has. I ask for what they do not use and cannot use. The high places. The rough places. The lands their fat sheep cannot climb.\"\n\n\n\nDon Alonso's expression is carefully neutral, but a slight tightening around his eyes suggests Martín has struck a nerve.\n\n\n\"The Mesta has not yet assessed Granada's potential,\" he says smoothly. \"We would not wish to... divide resources prematurely.\"\n\n\nThe tension between them is now fully visible.\n\n\n\nJuan may direct the conversation—or render judgment."

Legal recognition for goatherds (a charter like the Mesta has)\n2. Help organizing access to markets\n3. Grazing rights in Granada's mountainous regions (Sierra Nevada, Alpujarras) - land the Mesta's sheep cannot easily use\n\nDon Alonso represents the Mesta - a powerful, ancient guild with royal privileges. The Mesta has historically guarded its privileges jealously. But Martín is specifically asking for land that sheep cannot use well - the steep, rocky mountain terrain.\n\nDon Alonso needs to respond realistically:\n- He won't want to give up ANY potential claim, even to land sheep don't currently use\n- But he also can't appear unreasonable before the king who just conquered Granada\n- He's a politician - he'll try to negotiate, to preserve options, to not give a flat \"yes\" that binds the Mesta\n\nLet me think about what a shrewd noble representing powerful interests would say:\n1. He won't outright object - that would seem petty and unreasonable\n2. But he'll try to add conditions or preserve Mesta interests\n3. He might ask for something in return\n4. He might try to limit the scope of what's being granted\n\nThis is a good opportunity for realistic NPC behavior - not being a pushover, but also not being irrationally hostile.\n\n\nDon Alonso's face remains carefully composed, but Juan can see the calculation behind his eyes. The nobleman is weighing options—what he can oppose, what he cannot, what he might gain from concession.\n\n\nA long pause.\n\n\n\"Majesty... the Mesta has always supported the crown. Our loyalty is beyond question.\"\n\n\nHe chooses his words with care.\n\n\n\"If you ask whether I object to the goatherds having legal recognition—no. Let them have their charter. It costs the Mesta nothing, and organized herders are better than chaos in the hills.\"\n\n\nA slight inclination of the head.\n\n\n\"If you ask whether I object to them organizing for market access—no. Let them sell their hides to Córdoba. The Mesta deals in wool, not leather. We do not compete in this.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, and his tone shifts subtly.\n\n\n\"But Granada...\"\n\n\nHe glances at Martín, then back to Juan.\n\n\n\"Majesty, Granada is new. Its pastures are unassessed. Its potential is unknown. I do not object to goatherds grazing the high mountains—the steep places where sheep cannot thrive. This is reasonable.\"\n\n\nHis voice firms.\n\n\n\"But I would ask that the lowlands of Granada—the plains, the river valleys, the gentler slopes—be reserved for future assessment. The Mesta has not yet surveyed these lands. If they prove suitable for sheep, we would wish to expand there in time.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands, the gesture of a man being reasonable.\n\n\n\"Let us divide by terrain, Majesty. The mountains for goats. The lowlands for sheep. Each to the ground that suits them. This seems just to me.\"\n\n\nHe looks at Martín.\n\n\n\"Would you object to this?\"\n\n\n\nMartín considers, then looks to Juan, waiting for the king's judgment rather than answering Don Alonso directly."

The region will strategically divide Granada, allocating mountains for goat herding and lowlands for sheep. Significant infrastructure improvements are planned, with 12-15,000 florins annually drawn from the 40,000 infrastructure budget. These improvements will focus on watering infrastructure, maintaining drove roads, and establishing new routes into Granada.\n\nThe Dominicans and Inquisition have allocated 5,000 florins for initial preparations, with Torquemada tasked to prepare facilities in Granada while awaiting papal approval.\n\nFor the spymaster Isaac de Baeza, a personal gift of 500 florins is planned, along with 6,000 florins for initial setup and 4,500 florins for ongoing annual expenses. Additional personnel include Tomás de Cuenca, a physician with potential covert skills, and Demetrios Komnenos, a shadow guardian to be recruited from Venice.\n\nThe comprehensive infrastructure program under Diego de Daza will invest 40,000 florins annually for five years, totaling 200,000 florins. This includes 12-15,000 annually for herding infrastructure and 25,000 for broader priorities like port improvements, urban road development, and establishing a Córdoba tannery facility.\n\n\nI'll create a comprehensive document summarizing all the economic investments and plans.\n\n\nCreate File: Creating a document summarizing all economic investments and plans from the council sessions in late 1434\n\n\nThought process\n\nThe document has been created.
