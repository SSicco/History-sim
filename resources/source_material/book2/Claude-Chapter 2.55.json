Hunt at Niepołomice Forest planned in three days. Juan announced plan for muster in 1440 to Újlaki. Another war council to follow the hunt.\n\nI need to pick up exactly where we left off - Juan is alone with Miklós Újlaki in the war council chamber after their private conversation about realistic troop numbers. The others have departed. The hunt at Niepołomice Forest is planned in three days.\n\nLet me write the chapter introduction that orients the player without advancing events.\n\n\nChapter 2.55\n\n\nEarly September 1439, Morning\n\n\nThe war council chamber has emptied. Where an hour ago Polish and Hungarian lords debated supply lines and troop commitments, now only two figures remain amid the aftermath—goblets half-drained, maps still weighted at their corners, the lingering smell of tallow and sweat from a dozen bodies crowded into strategy.\n\n\nMiklós Újlaki stands across the table from you, the Ban of Macsó having just finished his sober assessment: of fifty thousand men promised, expect thirty-five thousand to answer the call. Of those, perhaps twenty-five thousand truly reliable. The rest will melt away when the campaign grows hard—interior lords who have never smelled a Turkish horse, who calculate advantage rather than duty. Only the frontier men, those who face the Crescent daily, will fight to the last.\n\n\nYour announcement hangs in the air between you—the muster you intend to hold in 1440, before the campaign begins. A counting of heads before you march, to know what force you truly command rather than what parchment promises.\n\n\nMorning light streams through the narrow windows of Wawel Castle, casting long shadows across the chamber. Beyond these walls, Kraków stirs—the city that received your road-worn embassy after the difficult passage through Moravia, where villages emptied at your approach and Olomouc barred its gates against \"crusaders.\" In three days, the hunt at Niepołomice Forest. After that, another war council where you will present your muster plan formally.\n\n\nÚjlaki watches you with the steady gaze of a man who has gambled everything on this alliance."

Let me handle:\n1. Újlaki's departure\n2. Brief narration of the three days of rest\n3. The letter-writing (without writing Juan's actual words - I can describe him writing but not the content)\n4. Arrival at the hunt\n\nI need to be careful not to write Juan's dialogue or the contents of his letter. I can describe the scene and then move to the hunt.\n\nLet me check - Hidalgo is mentioned as Juan's battle mount. I should verify this is consistent with previous chapters. The player clearly knows this is his horse's name, so I'll go with it.\n\nThe hunt at Niepołomice Forest was mentioned - this is a real historical hunting ground of Polish kings, located about 25 km from Kraków. It was indeed famous for its game.\n\nLet me set up the hunt scene appropriately. Who would be present?\n- King Władysław III (age 15)\n- Likely Bishop Oleśnicki\n- Polish nobles\n- Juan's accompanying nobles (I should think about who came with him - 500-man embassy)\n- Újlaki possibly\n\nI'll narrate the three days passing, the departure for the hunt, and set the scene at Niepołomice Forest, then stop to let the player act.\n\n\nÚjlaki inclines his head, a warrior's respect passing between you. \"Until the forest, Your Majesty.\" He gathers his cloak and departs, his footsteps echoing down the stone corridor.\n\n\n\nThe three days pass in blessed stillness.\n\n\nYour quarters in Wawel Castle are comfortable—thick walls that hold the early autumn chill at bay, a fire kept burning by attentive Polish servants who speak no Castilian but understand the universal language of a tired traveler. The hard passage through Moravia has left its mark on your embassy; men sleep twelve hours at a stretch, wounds from thorns and bad roads finally given time to heal, bellies filled with Polish hospitality after the extortionate prices of hostile villages.\n\n\nYou write by candlelight on the second evening. The letter to Toledo will take weeks to arrive—across the Alps, down through Italy, by ship to Barcelona, overland to Castile. By the time Lucia reads your words, autumn will have turned toward winter. You write of the journey, of Kraków, of the young king who reminds you of yourself at that age—hungry for glory, not yet tempered by its costs. To Catalina, now seven and surely terrorizing her tutors. To Fernando, six and learning the sword. To little Bianca, four. To the child Lucia carries, who will be born before you return home.\n\n\nThe quill moves across parchment. Personal words. Private things. The letter grows thick before you seal it with the arms of Castile and entrust it to a courier.\n\n\n\nSeptember 8th, 1439\n\n\nNiepołomice Forest\n\n\nHidalgo knows the difference between a parade and a hunt. The great destrier—fifteen hands of Andalusian muscle bred for war—tosses his head as you ride through the forest gate, nostrils flaring at unfamiliar scents. Polish pine and oak instead of Castilian olive and cork. Different soil. Different air. But game is game, and Hidalgo has carried you through wilder terrain than this.\n\n\nYour escort numbers perhaps forty men—a mix of Castilian knights who survived the Moravian passage and guardsmen in your personal livery. Enough to honor your station without overwhelming the Polish hunt. The forest opens around you in endless columns of ancient trees, their canopy filtering the morning light into golden shafts. Somewhere ahead, horns sound—the Polish hunting party already gathering at the forest lodge.\n\n\nYou emerge into a clearing where perhaps two hundred men have assembled. Horses stamp and snort. Dogs bay in their kennels, eager for release. Polish nobles in their distinctive dress—long coats trimmed with fur, curved sabres at their hips—mingle with Hungarian lords who rode north with Újlaki.\n\n\nAt the center of it all, mounted on a grey stallion, King Władysław III of Poland, Lithuania, and Hungary sits surrounded by his court. At fifteen, he has not yet grown into his father's frame, but he sits his horse like a man born to the saddle. His eyes find you across the clearing, and a smile breaks across his young face—genuine, eager, the expression of a boy about to share his favorite pastime with a new friend.\n\n\nBeside him, Bishop Oleśnicki observes your approach with considerably more reserve.\n\n\n\"King Juan!\" Władysław calls out, his voice carrying across the clearing. \"You honor Polish tradition! Come—today we hunt the żubr, the great forest ox. Have you such beasts in Castile?\""

Let me read the chaos-roll skill to understand how to properly construct this table.\n\n\nView: Reading the chaos-roll skill to understand how to construct d100 tables for uncertain events\n\n\nThought process: Architected medieval hunt outcomes balancing social and physical stakes.\n\nNow I need to construct a realistic d100 table for a royal hunt in medieval Poland. Let me think through this carefully:\n\n**The situation:** Juan is participating in a Polish royal hunt for żubr (European bison) in Niepołomice Forest with King Władysław III and the Polish court. This is:\n\n1. A diplomatic/social opportunity - a chance to bond with Władysław\n2. A physical activity with some inherent danger (hunting large game)\n3. A cultural exchange - Juan is a guest participating in Polish tradition\n\n**Factors to consider:**\n\n**Risk-reducing factors:**\n- Royal hunt, well-organized with many experienced hunters\n- Polish hunters are experts in this terrain and this game\n- Large hunting party (200+ men) \n- Juan is an experienced warrior and rider\n- Hidalgo is a trained warhorse\n- September - good weather season for hunting\n- Niepołomice Forest is a traditional royal hunting ground, familiar to the Poles\n\n**Risk-increasing factors:**\n- Juan is unfamiliar with żubr hunting specifically\n- European bison are dangerous - large, aggressive if wounded\n- Unfamiliar terrain (Polish forest vs Castilian landscape)\n- Cultural expectations - pressure to perform well before the Polish court\n- Political stakes - this is also a diplomatic event\n\n**What could happen at a medieval royal hunt?**\n\nMost hunts were uneventful socially - they achieved their purpose of entertainment and bonding. But hunts could involve:\n- Successful kill with honor going to various participants\n- Injury from game (bison, boar can gore or trample)\n- Accidents (falls from horses, stray arrows/spears)\n- Minor incidents (getting lost, horse throwing rider)\n- Social success or failure (impressing or embarrassing oneself)\n- Bonding or tensions between participants\n\n**Historical context:**\n- Żubr (European bison) hunts were prestigious - these animals were protected in Polish royal forests\n- The hunt would typically involve driving game toward the hunters or tracking\n\n\n- Kings often gave the honor of the kill to distinguished guests\n- Injuries at hunts were not uncommon but fatalities among nobility were rare (they had the best horses, weapons, and positions)\n\n**Building the table:**\n\nI should weight this toward the social and diplomatic dimensions—how Juan appears to the Polish court and whether he strengthens his relationship with Władysław. The physical outcomes matter too: does the hunt proceed smoothly, or does something go wrong? Most outcomes should fall in the 60-70% range where things go reasonably well with some meaningful variation in how Juan performs or what complications arise.\n\nThe remaining possibilities split between stronger outcomes like exceptional bonding or performance (15-25%), minor setbacks such as equipment issues or awkward moments (10-15%), and rare extremes like serious injury or remarkable triumph (1-5%).\n\n\nChaos Roll: The Hunt at Niepołomice Forest\n\n\nRelevant factors:\n\n\nRisk-reducing:\n\n\nRoyal hunt, expertly organized with experienced Polish huntsmen\n\nLarge party (~200 men) with many veterans of this forest\n\nJuan is an accomplished warrior and rider on a trained warhorse\n\nSeptember—good weather, favorable season\n\nNiepołomice is a familiar royal preserve to the Poles\n\n\nRisk-increasing:\n\n\nJuan has never hunted żubr (European bison)—unfamiliar quarry\n\nUnfamiliar terrain (Polish forest, not Castilian landscape)\n\nDiplomatic stakes—the Polish court is watching the foreign king\n\nŻubr are dangerous game—aggressive when wounded, 800+ pounds of muscle and horn\n\nCultural expectations to perform well as guest of honor\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-3\nDisaster: Serious injury to Juan or a member of his party during the hunt. The żubr or the forest itself proves unforgiving.\n4-8\nEmbarrassment: A humiliating moment—horse trouble, missed shot, or breach of Polish hunting etiquette. The court notices. Juan's dignity suffers.\n9-15\nNear Miss: A dangerous moment—charged by wounded game, thrown from horse, or narrowly avoiding injury. Juan handles it, but it was close.\n16-30\nAdequate Performance: Juan participates competently but unremarkably. Neither distinguished nor embarrassed. Władysław is polite but no special bond forms.\n31-55\nSolid Hunt: The hunt goes well. Juan performs creditably, earns respect from the Polish hunters, and has good conversations with Władysław. A foundation for friendship.\n56-75\nDistinguished Guest: Juan impresses with his horsemanship or composure. Władysław offers him an honor—perhaps a shot at the great bull, or public praise before the court. Real warmth develops.\n76-90\nBrothers in the Chase: A moment of genuine connection with Władysław—shared danger, shared triumph, or a private conversation that reveals common ground. The young king begins to see Juan as mentor, not just ally.\n91-97\nTriumph: Juan distinguishes himself memorably—perhaps a difficult kill, saving someone from danger, or demonstrating exceptional skill. The Polish court speaks of it afterward. Władysław's admiration deepens significantly.\n98-100\nThe Stuff of Legend: Something extraordinary occurs—a feat that will be told in Polish hunting stories for years. Juan's reputation among the Poles transforms from \"foreign ally\" to something approaching legend.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

Juan performs creditably, earns respect from the Polish hunters, and has good conversations with Władysław. A foundation for friendship.\"\n\nThis is a good, solid outcome - not spectacular, but positive. I should narrate the hunt going well, Juan performing competently, and some meaningful interaction with Władysław that builds their relationship. I shouldn't overdo it - this is a \"foundation for friendship,\" not a dramatic breakthrough moment.\n\nI need to be careful to:\n1. Narrate the hunt authentically\n2. Show Juan participating competently but not heroically\n3. Include some good conversation/interaction with Władysław\n4. End at a natural stopping point for the player to act\n5. Not generate dialogue or actions for Juan\n\nLet me write this scene showing a solid, respectful hunt with some genuine moments of connection.\n\n\nRoll 39 — Solid Hunt\n\n\n\nThe żubr is nothing like the bulls of Castile.\n\n\nYou understand this the moment the dogs flush the first beast from the undergrowth—a cow, which the huntsmen let pass with shouts and horn-calls. But the sound that follows her, the crashing through brush that shakes saplings like wheat stalks, announces something else entirely. The great forest ox emerges into a clearing perhaps forty yards ahead: shoulders like a siege engine, horns curved and black, a beard of coarse hair hanging beneath a head that could crush a man's chest with a single toss.\n\n\nHidalgo knows war. He does not know this. The destrier sidesteps, ears flat, and you feel the old familiar dance—controlling a thousand pounds of trained muscle that wants very badly to be elsewhere. Around you, the Polish hunters move with practiced ease on their lighter horses, circling, calling to one another in rapid Polish you cannot follow.\n\n\nWładysław appears at your side, his grey stallion dancing with excitement. \"The bull! You see him? That is what we hunt today!\"\n\n\nThe chase that follows is controlled chaos. The Poles know this forest, know these beasts, know exactly how to drive the żubr toward the killing ground without letting it turn and charge. You ride in the middle of the pack, following the flow of experienced hunters, learning their signals by observation. When a huntsman waves you left, you go left. When the horns sound a particular pattern, you slow. Hidalgo settles into the work, his war-training translating well enough to the unfamiliar terrain.\n\n\nThe kill, when it comes, belongs to Władysław—as it should. The young king's spear-cast is clean and true, taking the great bull behind the shoulder. It staggers, bellows, and falls. The forest erupts in cheers, horns sounding victory.\n\n\n\nThe afternoon hunt yields three more żubr and several boar. You acquit yourself well on the boar—familiar quarry, familiar technique—and your clean kill earns approving nods from the Polish hunters. Not spectacular. Not embarrassing. The work of a competent horseman who knows his limitations and respects the expertise of his hosts.\n\n\nIt is during the rest, as the huntsmen dress the carcasses and the nobles gather around fires with hot wine, that the real value of the day emerges.\n\n\nWładysław finds you standing apart, watching the work.\n\n\n\"You ride well,\" the young king says, steam rising from the cup in his hands. \"Different from us—you sit deeper in the saddle, yes? But well.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to a fallen log, an invitation to sit. The court is distant enough for private conversation, near enough to see their king and his foreign guest at ease together.\n\n\n\"Koniecpol tells me you have fought since you were younger than I am now,\" Władysław continues. \"The Moors. The—what do you call them? The Reconquista.\" He attempts the Spanish word with a heavy Polish accent. \"I have read of it. Eight hundred years of war to reclaim your homeland.\"\n\n\nHis eyes are eager, curious—a young man who has inherited a war he did not start, seeking wisdom from one who has finished his."

Let me search for this information.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Identified pivotal ambush battle showcasing strategic military deception.\n\nI found the key information about Juan's first major battle as king - the Battle of Alcalá la Real. Let me extract the relevant details:\n\nThe battle was at Alcalá la Real. Sultan Muhammad IX of Granada made a desperate gamble - he marched his field army of 16,000 troops on a forced march to catch the Castilians during siege construction. His scouts reported what appeared to be a small force with only one bombard beginning siege works.\n\nThis was a calculated deception. Juan had deployed only 5,000 troops and a single bombard at the siege works while positioning his main army (18,000 troops) in three infantry battles plus heavy cavalry reserve behind terrain features. Infante Enrique commanded the visible 5,000-man force.\n\nWhen the Sultan's army arrived exhausted from the forced march and attacked what they thought was an unprepared enemy, the full Castilian force revealed itself. The battle lasted several hours and resulted in catastrophic defeat for Granada:\n- Granada: ~2,000 killed, ~2,500 wounded or captured (including 580 prisoners)\n- Castile: 87 killed, 143 wounded\n\nThe Sultan himself barely escaped. His field army was effectively destroyed as an organized fighting force.\n\nSo this was the battle where Juan lured the enemy into an ambush and led his heavy cavalry into the fight. This is clearly what the player is referring to.\n\n\nYou settle onto the fallen log beside the young king, the sounds of the hunt's aftermath around you—huntsmen calling to one another, the heavy thud of carcasses being loaded onto carts, dogs barking for scraps.\n\n\n\"My first great battle as king,\" you begin, and something in your voice makes Władysław lean forward, his cup forgotten. \"Alcalá la Real. Spring of 1431. I was nineteen—four years older than you are now.\"\n\n\nYou describe it as it was: the fortress on its hilltop, the single bombard you positioned where the enemy scouts could see it, the five thousand men making a show of beginning siege works. How you hid eighteen thousand men—your main army, three battles of infantry and all your heavy cavalry—behind the ridgelines where the terrain swallowed them from sight.\n\n\n\"Sultan Muhammad took the bait,\" you continue. \"His scouts told him what I wanted them to see: a small force, unprepared, beginning siege construction. He force-marched sixteen thousand men through the night to catch us.\"\n\n\nWładysław's eyes are bright. \"And they arrived exhausted.\"\n\n\n\"Exhausted. Disordered. Certain they had caught us unaware.\" You can still remember that morning—the dust cloud of the Granadan army appearing on the road, the tension in your chest as you waited for the precise moment. \"They attacked what they thought was our whole army. And then...\"\n\n\nYou pause, and the Polish king waits, barely breathing.\n\n\n\"Then I led the cavalry charge myself. Every heavy horseman I had. We came over the ridge like a wave, struck them in the flank while they were already committed against our infantry.\" You can still feel Hidalgo beneath you—not this Hidalgo, but his predecessor, the great destrier who carried you into that first charge. \"The Sultan's army broke. Two thousand dead. Twenty-five hundred captured or wounded. The Sultan himself barely escaped with his life.\"\n\n\nYou look at your hands, remembering. \"Eighty-seven of my men died. One hundred forty-three wounded. In a single afternoon, I destroyed Granada's ability to fight in the open field. Everything after that—the sieges, the final surrender—was inevitable from that moment.\"\n\n\nWładysław is silent for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice is quieter than before.\n\n\n\"You were nineteen. Leading the charge yourself.\" It is not quite a question.\n\n\n\"A king must be seen,\" you say. \"Not commanding from a hill. Not safe behind his guards. In the front, with his men, sharing their danger. That is how you earn the right to ask them to die for you.\"\n\n\nThe young king stares into his cup. Around you, the Polish forest settles into afternoon stillness, the hunt's excitement fading into contemplation.\n\n\n\"At Varna,\" Władysław says slowly, \"when we face the Sultan... you will ride with us? Not behind?\""

This is mentorship from an experienced warrior-king to an eager young one.\n\nWładysław is 15, hungry for glory, and has inherited wars he didn't start. He's looking to Juan as a role model. This advice about survival is important - historically, Władysław III died at the Battle of Varna in 1444, leading a reckless cavalry charge against the Ottoman center. Juan is essentially trying to prevent that fate.\n\nI should have Władysław respond authentically - a young king who wants glory but is also genuinely listening to someone he respects. He might chafe slightly at being told to hold back, but he should also recognize the wisdom. The \"Don't die, king\" is a powerful, direct statement that deserves a meaningful response.\n\n\nWładysław listens intently, and you can see the war playing across his young face—the part of him that dreams of glory straining against the wisdom you offer. For a moment, you glimpse the boy who inherited two crowns before his beard came in, who has spent his reign so far watching others fight the battles he longs to join.\n\n\n\"At the front to inspire,\" he repeats slowly, working through it. \"But guarded before contact. And hold back until victory is certain.\" He grimaces slightly. \"It sounds... less glorious than the songs.\"\n\n\n\"The songs are written by men who never charged a line of Turkish janissaries,\" you say. \"Glory is for troubadours. Victory is for kings.\"\n\n\nHe absorbs this. Then, unexpectedly, he laughs—a young man's laugh, surprised out of him.\n\n\n\"My father said something similar once. 'Dead kings win no wars.'\" The laughter fades, replaced by something more serious. \"He died in his bed, you know. After decades of fighting. Crusades against the Teutonic Knights, wars with everyone. And he died old, surrounded by his children.\" Władysław looks at you directly. \"I used to think that was... less heroic. Now I think perhaps it was the greatest victory of all.\"\n\n\nHe extends his cup toward you—a gesture between equals, between brothers-in-arms who have not yet shared a battlefield but have shared something perhaps more valuable.\n\n\n\"Don't die, King Juan. Poland needs you alive. Hungary needs you alive.\" A pause, and the boyish grin returns. \"I need you alive. Who else will teach me how to win?\"\n\n\nFrom across the clearing, a horn sounds—the huntsmen signaling that the carcasses are loaded, the party ready to return to Kraków.

At this age, marriage negotiations would certainly be a topic of discussion, but he likely hasn't married yet.\n\nLet me craft a response that reflects this - a young king who hasn't yet married but is certainly aware that it's expected of him. Oleśnicki, as the powerful bishop and former regent, would likely have strong opinions about suitable matches.\n\n\nYou ride side by side through the forest, the column of hunters stretching behind you. Władysław's grey stallion matches pace with Hidalgo, the two horses falling into easy rhythm on the wide forest path. Dappled light filters through the canopy, and the smell of pine and autumn leaves fills the air.\n\n\nAt your question, Władysław's expression shifts—something between embarrassment and exasperation.\n\n\n\"Promised? Half the courts of Europe have sent proposals, if you believe Oleśnicki.\" He gestures vaguely toward where the Bishop rides further back in the column. \"A Habsburg archduchess. A Burgundian princess. There was talk of a Lithuanian match to strengthen the union, though that has... complications.\"\n\n\nHe shakes his head, and for a moment he looks less like a king and more like any fifteen-year-old boy confronted with the expectations of adults.\n\n\n\"The truth is, between becoming King of Poland at ten and King of Hungary at—what, fourteen?—there has been little time for...\" He searches for the word. \"Courtship. Oleśnicki handles the negotiations. He has opinions. Many opinions.\"\n\n\nA wry smile crosses his face. \"The Bishop believes a wife should bring alliance, territory, or both. He speaks of treaties and dowries. He does not ask if I might actually like the woman I am to spend my life beside.\"\n\n\nWładysław glances at you, curiosity in his eyes.\n\n\n\"You have married twice, yes? The Portuguese princess who died—God rest her soul—and now the Italian lady. The Este.\" He pronounces it carefully. \"Was it... did you have any choice in the matter? Or is that a foolish question for kings?\""

Let me check the details:\n\n1. First marriage to Isabel of Portugal - married February 1431\n- She was described as \"plain appearance, initially shy and uncertain\"\n- She gave him Catalina (born January 28, 1432) and Fernando (born August 3, 1433 - the day Isabel died)\n- She died in childbirth delivering Fernando\n\n2. Second marriage to Lucia d'Este - married December 3, 1433\n- Described as legendary beauty, grey-green eyes, dark hair, tall\n- They have:\n  - Catalina (step-daughter, from Isabel)\n  - Fernando (step-son, from Isabel)\n  - Bianca (born September 14, 1434)\n  - And Lucia is currently pregnant again (conceived late December 1434/January 1435, due September 1435)\n\nWait, the user says \"four children already and she will deliver a fifth soon.\" Let me count:\n- Catalina (Isabel's daughter, Lucia's step-daughter)\n- Fernando (Isabel's son, Lucia's step-son)\n- Bianca (Lucia's daughter, born September 14, 1434)\n- Current pregnancy (due September 1435)\n\nBut the chapter summary says we're in September 1439, and Lucia is pregnant again (due September 1440 according to Chapter 2.54 summary). Let me check the timeline more carefully.\n\nFrom Chapter 2.54:\n- Current date: Early September 1439\n- \"Queen Lucia pregnant, due September 1440\"\n\nSo by September 1439, Lucia would have given birth to more children since 1435. Let me think about what children Lucia has had:\n- Bianca (September 1434)\n- Child due September 1435 (mentioned in Chapter 2.32)\n- Possibly more children between 1435-1439\n\nThe user says \"four children already and she will deliver a fifth soon.\" This is Juan speaking in-character, so I should accept this as the player's understanding of the timeline. It's possible that:\n\n\n- Lucia has had 4 children total (Bianca + 3 more)\n- She's pregnant with a 5th\n\nThe character database through February 1435 shows Lucia was pregnant with a child due September 1435, but we're now in September 1439, so there would have been additional births in the intervening years that I should account for.\n\nThe player knows their campaign details better than I do, so I'll accept their accounting of Lucia's children. Władysław, at fifteen, would find this discussion of marriage and family compelling—he's hearing from an established king about love and domestic life, which would naturally spark his curiosity and perhaps some envy about Juan's experience.\n\n\nWładysław laughs at your expression when you speak of Lucia's beauty—a young man's laugh, appreciating the sentiment.\n\n\n\"Five children,\" he says, shaking his head with something like wonder. \"And you have been king for—nine years now? Ten?\" He counts silently. \"The House of Trastámara will not lack for heirs.\"\n\n\nThere is something wistful beneath the admiration. A boy-king with two crowns and no siblings of his own blood to share the burden. His father Władysław II Jagiełło had been ancient when he sired him—over seventy years old—and his mother Sophia had died when he was barely four.\n\n\n\"You loved the first one,\" Władysław says, more quietly now. \"Even though she was not beautiful. Even though it was necessity.\" He considers this. \"And the second? The beautiful one?\"\n\n\nHe asks it carefully, as a young man might ask an older one about the mysteries of marriage—not prurient curiosity, but genuine uncertainty about his own future.\n\n\n\"Do you love her too? Or is it... different? When she is beautiful and clever and gives you children, but you did not choose her either?\"\n\n\nThe question hangs in the autumn air. Behind you, the column of Polish nobles rides at a respectful distance, giving their king privacy with his foreign guest. Oleśnicki's eyes remain fixed on the two of you, but he is too far to hear."

Let me think about how Władysław would react:\n\n1. He's young (15) and eager for glory\n2. He's committed to the crusade publicly (Roll 93 in the previous chapter)\n3. He has advisors like Oleśnicki who are more cautious\n4. Hungary has been bleeding on the frontier - this is personal for him\n5.

Władysław is a young king, fifteen years old, who is eager for glory but also learning wisdom. He's just heard Juan speak with absolute conviction about total war against the Ottomans.\n\nI should have Władysław react to this - he's young, idealistic, and has been waiting for someone to actually commit to fighting the Ottomans rather than just talking about it. This should resonate deeply with him. But I also need to be careful not to make him too easily swayed - he's a king in his own right, with his own council and considerations.\n\nThe scene is ending as they approach Kraków.

This is a persuasion situation - Juan is trying to convince Władysław and his council to implement training musters\n2. There's also a practical/historical question about whether Polish and Hungarian feudal systems even allow for this kind of thing\n\nI should consult the persuasion skill document to understand how to build this table properly. Let me also think about the historical context:\n\nPoland in the 1430s:\n- The pospolite ruszenie (general levy) was the traditional Polish military system\n- Nobles were obligated to serve when called, but calling them for \"practice\" might be unusual\n- The szlachta (nobility) were fiercely protective of their privileges\n- There were concerns about royal overreach\n\nHungary in the 1430s:\n- The banderia system - magnates maintained private armies\n- Complex obligations between king and magnates\n- Recent civil wars and instability\n- Magnate feuds (Hunyadi vs Garai) as mentioned in the chapter summary\n\nThis is genuinely uncertain:\n- Władysław is enthusiastic and has committed to the crusade\n- But this request involves asking nobles to assemble without immediate war - potentially unpopular\n- Oleśnicki will have concerns about precedent\n- The military commanders (Koniecpol, Újlaki) might see the wisdom but know the political difficulties\n- The szlachta representative Tarnowski will be protective of noble privileges\n\nLet me read the persuasion skill to understand how to construct this properly.\n\nActually, wait - the user said to draft a d100 table. Let me think about what factors apply here:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n- Władysław is personally enthusiastic and has already committed to the crusade\n- The military commanders understand the practical value (Koniecpol, Újlaki)\n\n\n- Juan's prior demonstrations of competence and the substantial gift have built credibility\n- The formal declaration to the Sultan creates genuine urgency\n- Juan frames this as a counting and training exercise rather than a full mobilization\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n- This is unprecedented - nobles don't typically muster for \"practice\"\n- The szlachta are protective of their privileges - this could set a dangerous precedent\n- Oleśnicki will worry about royal overreach\n- Hungary has internal divisions - calling a muster might expose weaknesses or provoke magnate rivalries\n- Some nobles will see this as a burden without immediate necessity\n- Polish-Hungarian cooperation is already complicated\n- The logistical costs of feeding assembled men without an actual campaign\n- The region's memory of the Hussite Wars makes \"muster\" carry ominous weight\n\nHistorically, musters for actual campaigns were standard, but practice musters were virtually unheard of - feudal obligations typically bound nobles to war, not training. Yet the extraordinary circumstances—a declared war in 1441 with a foreign king bringing 30,000 men—might make this more palatable than it would normally be. I need to consider how persuasion mechanics apply here and structure the outcome to show both whether the council attempts this and what practically results from it.\n\n\nView: Reading the persuasion skill to understand how to construct the d100 table for this council proposal\n\n\nThought process: Weighed political resistance against military practicality for muster proposal.\n\nNow let me think about this persuasion attempt carefully.\n\n**The Ask:**\nJuan is proposing that Poland and Hungary conduct \"training musters\" - assembling their feudal levies not for war, but to count them, train them, and get them accustomed to operating as a larger army. This is in preparation for the 1441 campaign.\n\n**Historical Context - Let me think about what I know:**\n\nPolish military system (pospolite ruszenie):\n- General levy of the nobility\n- Nobles obligated to serve when called for war\n- The szlachta were extremely protective of their privileges\n- Calling a muster without immediate war could be seen as precedent for royal overreach\n- However, musters to COUNT forces before campaigns did happen\n\nHungarian military system (banderia):\n- Magnates maintained private armies\n- Complex feudal obligations\n- Recent civil wars and instability\n- Magnate feuds (mentioned: Hunyadi vs Garai)\n- Internal divisions make a \"muster\" potentially exposing weaknesses\n\n**Key question: Would this request even be considered?**\n\nI think the answer is \"maybe, with significant complications.\" Here's why:\n\n1. The council has already committed to the crusade (Roll 93 + Roll 99 in previous chapter)\n2. Władysław has personally committed and just signed the letter to the Sultan\n3. The military commanders (Koniecpol, Újlaki) understand the tactical value\n4. BUT - this involves calling nobles to assemble without immediate war\n5. The szlachta representative Tarnowski will be concerned about precedent\n6. Oleśnicki will worry about political implications\n7. Hungary's internal divisions make a muster potentially problematic\n8. Cost and logistics of feeding assembled men\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- Władysław is enthusiastic and personally committed\n- The formal declaration to the Sultan makes this urgent and real\n- Military commanders understand the practical value\n- Juan's 100,000 florin gift has created enormous goodwill\n\n\n- Juan himself brings 30,000 trained soldiers, so he's not asking for something he hasn't already committed to\n- This is preparation work, not an immediate demand for combat\n- The border lords who actually deal with Ottoman threats will likely see the value in readiness\n- Juan's proven success in the Reconquista gives weight to his military judgment\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- This breaks precedent—the nobility aren't accustomed to assembling for training rather than actual warfare\n- It risks establishing a dangerous precedent where the crown can summon forces at will\n- The szlachta will resist anything that appears to expand royal authority over their obligations\n- Oleśnicki will calculate the political costs carefully\n- Hungary's internal factions could clash if a muster exposes their divisions or creates tension between magnates\n- Feeding troops without a campaign drains resources\n- Lords far from Ottoman borders may view this as an imposition rather than necessity\n- Polish-Hungarian relations are already strained, and coordination adds complexity\n\n**Approach Quality:**\nJuan's strategy has real strengths—he's leading by example with his own forces, framing this as preparation rather than command, asking respectfully rather than demanding, and the signed letter creates a sense of urgency. Yet he's missing some crucial elements: he hasn't offered to subsidize the costs, hasn't provided ways for nobles to save face, and hasn't directly addressed the precedent concern that will worry Oleśnicki most.\n\n**Assessment:**\nThis leans toward possible but uncertain. The military commanders who face Ottoman pressure will likely support it, though the political resistance from interior nobles and the crown's treasury concerns could still derail the effort.\n\nThe roll will determine both how receptive the political actors are and what practical constraints emerge. Lower results bring strong resistance focused on precedent and cost. Middle results show the military backing the idea while politicians raise serious objections. Higher results move toward conditional agreement with modifications, and the strongest rolls bring genuine enthusiasm with concrete planning.\n\n\nPersuasion Assessment: Training Musters for Poland and Hungary\n\n\nThe Ask:\nJuan proposes that Poland and Hungary conduct preparatory musters—assembling their feudal levies not for immediate war, but to count actual strength, conduct training, and accustom men to operating in a larger combined army before the 1441 campaign.\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nWładysław is personally committed and just signed the declaration to the Sultan\n\nMilitary commanders (Koniecpol, Újlaki) understand the tactical value\n\nJuan's 100,000 florin gift has created substantial goodwill\n\nJuan leads by example—he has already called musters in his own realms\n\nThe declaration to Murad makes preparation feel urgent and real\n\nFrontier lords who face Ottomans daily will support thorough preparation\n\nJuan's proven track record in the Reconquista lends credibility\n\nHe asks respectfully (\"Can the crowns perform this?\") rather than demanding\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nUnprecedented—nobles are called for war, not \"practice\"\n\nSets dangerous precedent: the king can summon us whenever he wishes?\n\nThe szlachta are fiercely protective of their privileges (Tarnowski will object)\n\nOleśnicki will worry about political implications and royal overreach\n\nHungary's internal divisions (Hunyadi vs Garai, Elisabeth supporters) make musters politically dangerous\n\nCost of feeding assembled men without actual campaign revenue\n\nInterior lords who don't face Ottomans will resent the burden\n\nExposes actual strength—or weakness—which some magnates prefer to hide\n\n\nApproach Assessment:\nGood but incomplete. Juan leads by example and frames respectfully, but hasn't addressed the precedent concern or offered to offset costs.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll: Reception of the Muster Proposal\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-8\nPolitical Backlash: Oleśnicki and Tarnowski unite in opposition. The szlachta see this as foreign overreach—a Castilian king teaching Poles how to organize their own army. Władysław is forced to defer to his council. The proposal is politely but firmly rejected, and Juan's standing with the political faction suffers.\n9-20\nSerious Concerns Dominate: The military men see merit, but Oleśnicki raises pointed questions about precedent and cost. Tarnowski speaks for the szlachta's privileges. Władysław hesitates, unwilling to override his council on domestic matters. The proposal is tabled \"for further consideration\"—diplomatic refusal.\n21-35\nDivided Council: Koniecpol and Újlaki support the idea openly; Oleśnicki and Tarnowski raise objections. Władysław is caught between factions. A lesser version might be possible—perhaps a muster of frontier lords only, or a \"review\" rather than full assembly. No clear resolution today.\n36-50\nConditional Agreement: The council agrees the concept has merit, but demands modifications. Perhaps regional musters rather than full assembly. Perhaps limited to those who volunteer. Perhaps only in Hungary where the threat is immediate. Practical concerns about cost and logistics are raised.\n51-70\nAgreement with Complications: Władysław commits to attempting musters, and the military commanders support him. Oleśnicki extracts conditions (formal treaties first, clear limitations on precedent). Újlaki privately warns that Hungarian magnates may find excuses—expect 60-70% compliance at best.\n71-85\nStrong Agreement: The council unites behind the proposal. Koniecpol offers to personally oversee the Polish muster. Újlaki commits to pressing Hungarian magnates. Oleśnicki accepts with minor conditions. Concrete planning begins—locations, timing, logistics.\n86-95\nEnthusiastic Adoption: The proposal is embraced as wisdom. Władysław declares he will personally attend the musters to show royal commitment. The military commanders begin detailed planning immediately. Even Oleśnicki acknowledges the value. The szlachta representative is won over by the frontier lords' support.\n96-100\nBeyond Expectations: The council not only agrees but expands the concept. Perhaps joint exercises between Polish and Hungarian forces. Perhaps Władysław will visit the frontier to inspect defenses. The muster becomes a rallying symbol of the coming crusade. Concrete offers of coordination and support emerge.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

This means the military men support the idea, but Oleśnicki and Tarnowski raise objections. Władysław is caught between factions. A lesser version might be possible—perhaps a muster of frontier lords only, or a \"review\" rather than full assembly. No clear resolution today.\n\nLet me write this scene showing the divided council, with the military commanders supporting Juan and the political/szlachta faction raising objections. Władysław should be visibly torn between his desire to follow Juan's lead and the reality of his domestic political constraints.\n\n\nRoll 27 — Divided Council\n\n\n\nThe chamber falls silent as you finish outlining the proposal. Maps of Poland and Hungary spread across the table, marked with the routes armies might take, the places where men might gather.\n\n\nHetman Koniecpol speaks first, his scarred face thoughtful. \"It is sound. I have seen campaigns fail because lords arrived with half the men they promised, or with men who had never marched together. If we know in 1440 what we truly have, we plan better for 1441.\"\n\n\n\"The frontier lords will come,\" Újlaki adds, nodding. \"Those of us who watch the Ottoman border—we understand. Training together, learning each other's signals, knowing who stands beside you...\" He spreads his hands. \"This is how professional armies are made.\"\n\n\nBut Bishop Oleśnicki has not moved. His hawk's eyes remain fixed on you, and when he speaks, his voice carries the weight of a man who has shaped Polish politics for two decades.\n\n\n\"An interesting proposal, Your Majesty of Castile.\" The emphasis on your foreign title is subtle but unmistakable. \"You have called musters in your own realms, you say. Castile, Aragon, Naples—kingdoms where the crown commands and nobles obey.\" He pauses. \"Poland is not Castile.\"\n\n\nJan Tarnowski stirs, the szlachta representative finding his voice. \"The Bishop speaks truth. Our liberties are ancient. The pospolite ruszenie is called for war, not for... practice. If the king may summon us whenever he wishes, for counting and drilling like common soldiers...\" He shakes his head. \"Today it is preparation. Tomorrow it is taxation. The day after, it is tyranny.\"\n\n\n\"No one speaks of tyranny—\" Władysław begins, but Oleśnicki cuts smoothly across him.\n\n\n\"Of course not, Your Majesty. King Juan's intentions are surely honorable. But precedent, once set, outlives intention.\" The Bishop turns to you, his tone perfectly courteous. \"In Castile, Your Majesty, do your nobles assemble at royal command without question? Do they not guard their ancient privileges?\"\n\n\nThe question is a trap. Answer yes, and you confirm Polish fears of absolutism. Answer no, and your own example loses force.\n\n\nWładysław's jaw tightens. You can see him wanting to override his council, to simply command as he commanded when signing the letter. But this is different. This touches Polish liberty itself—the very identity that makes the szlachta who they are.\n\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Koniecpol offers into the silence, \"a middle path. The frontier lords—those who face the Turk—we could gather. Call it a review of border defenses, not a muster. The interior lords need not be summoned.\"\n\n\n\"Hungary is another matter,\" Újlaki adds carefully. \"The king's authority there is... newer. The magnates guard their independence fiercely. I can press them, but I cannot promise compliance.\"\n\n\nWładysław looks at you, frustration barely concealed beneath royal composure. He wants to give you what you ask. He cannot—not without fracturing his own coalition before the war even begins.\n\n\nThe council waits."

      "say": "Thought process: Evaluated innovative incentive system and assessed noble reception prospects.\n\nThis is a clever pivot by the player. Rather than pushing against the resistance, Juan is reframing the muster entirely - from a royal command that threatens noble privileges to an opportunity system where participation brings rewards. He's essentially saying \"don't come because I order you, come because there's land and titles to be claimed.\"\n\nLet me assess this new approach:\n\n**The New Ask:**\nTransform the muster from a mandatory assembly into a voluntary \"land-claiming council\" where nobles who show up get to stake claims on reconquered territories, proportional to their contribution.\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- Reframes obligation as opportunity - no one's liberties are threatened\n- Appeals directly to self-interest (land, titles)\n- Creates competition among nobles to show up with MORE men, not fewer\n- Removes the precedent concern - this isn't \"king summons nobles for practice,\" it's \"nobles compete for future spoils\"\n- Hungary specifically has lost lands to the Ottomans - recovery of Serbian, Bulgarian territories is a real prospect\n- Újlaki and frontier lords already want to fight; this gives interior lords a reason to join\n- Addresses the \"hiding actual strength\" problem - now nobles WANT to show their strength\n- Creates accountability - you can't claim spoils without fighting\n- Koniecpol and Újlaki should love this (military logic + rewards)\n- Historical precedent: crusades often worked this way (Latin Empire, Outremer)\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- Dividing lands that aren't yet conquered could create conflicts among claimants\n- What if multiple powerful lords claim the same territory?\n- Some Hungarian magnates already HAVE claims to lost territories - this could threaten existing claims\n- Oleśnicki may worry about the Church's share\n- The szlachta might worry this favors wealthy lords who can bring more men\n- Creates winners and losers before the campaign even begins\n- If the campaign fails, you've promised lands you can't deliver\n- Some nobles may see this as crude - reducing sacred crusade to land-grabbing\n\n\n- Juan's demonstrated genuine interest in the concerns and offered a creative solution that sidesteps the precedent problem entirely. By framing this as a question rather than a demand, he's shown respect for the assembly's autonomy while appealing to their material interests. The approach is substantially stronger than the initial push, and the table should reflect improved odds of success despite the legitimate complications that remain.\n\n\nPersuasion Assessment: The Spoils System\n\n\nThe New Ask:\nTransform the muster from a royal command into a voluntary land-claiming council. Nobles who attend stake claims to reconquered territories proportional to their contribution. Those who don't show don't share the spoils.\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nReframes obligation as opportunity—no threat to noble liberties\n\nAppeals directly to self-interest (land, titles, wealth)\n\nCreates competition to bring MORE men, not excuses to bring fewer\n\nHungary has lost lands to Ottomans—real territories to reclaim (Serbia, parts of Bosnia)\n\nRemoves precedent concern entirely: \"come claim your future\" not \"obey your king\"\n\nAddresses the \"hiding strength\" problem—now lords WANT to display their forces\n\nHistorical precedent: crusading ventures have always distributed spoils to participants\n\nFrontier lords already committed; this gives interior lords reason to join\n\nAccountability built in: no contribution, no claim\n\nJuan listened to concerns and adapted—shows respect, not stubbornness\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nDividing unconquered lands creates potential conflicts among claimants\n\nWhat if two powerful magnates claim the same territory?\n\nSome Hungarian lords have existing claims to lost family lands—this could threaten or complicate those\n\nReduces holy crusade to land-grabbing in some eyes (Oleśnicki may object)\n\nFavors wealthy lords who can field more men—szlachta with smaller holdings may resent this\n\nIf campaign fails, promises become worthless—or worse, points of resentment\n\nCreates winners and losers before a single sword is drawn\n\nPoland gains less directly—Hungarian lands for Hungarian lords, but what of Polish nobles?\n\n\nApproach Quality:\nExcellent. Juan listened to objections, pivoted creatively, framed as a question rather than demand, and appealed to self-interest without crude insistence. This is skilled diplomacy.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll: Reception of the Spoils System\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nBackfire: Oleśnicki seizes on the proposal as evidence of mercenary motives—\"We speak of holy war, and the Castilian speaks of dividing spoils before blood is shed.\" The moral high ground shifts against Juan. Tarnowski worries aloud about rich lords swallowing everything. The creative proposal is rejected, and Juan's standing has worsened.\n6-15\nTheological Objection: Oleśnicki raises concerns about treating crusade as a land-grab. The Church must have its share; souls matter more than acres. The military men see merit but cannot override the Bishop's moral authority. Discussion becomes tangled in questions of crusading principle versus practical incentive.\n16-30\nPractical Complications Dominate: Újlaki admits the idea has appeal but raises hard questions. What of lords with existing ancestral claims to lost lands? Who arbitrates disputes between claimants? The szlachta worry about being outbid by magnates. The concept has merit, but implementation problems stall agreement.\n31-45\nPartial Adoption: The council agrees the incentive structure is sound for Hungary, where lands are to be reclaimed. Újlaki will propose it to Hungarian magnates. But Poland presents differently—they gain no direct territory. A modified version for Poland (perhaps shares in trade rights, or precedence in future councils) must be developed separately.\n46-65\nStrong Interest with Conditions: The military commanders embrace the concept enthusiastically. Oleśnicki extracts conditions—Church lands and rights must be respected, a portion for ecclesiastical purposes. The szlachta want guarantees that smaller nobles can participate meaningfully. Framework agreement emerges; details to be negotiated.\n66-80\nEnthusiastic Reception: The room shifts. Újlaki's eyes light up as he sees how this solves his \"interior lords\" problem. Koniecpol nods slowly—even Polish nobles might be enticed by Hungarian or Serbian lands. Oleśnicki concedes the wisdom of aligning interest with duty. Concrete discussion of how to structure the claims council begins.\n81-90\nCouncil United: The proposal transforms the mood entirely. What was division becomes collaboration as each faction sees how to benefit. Władysław visibly relaxes as his council finds common ground. Detailed planning begins—where to hold the council, how to register claims, what formula weights contribution.\n91-100\nBreakthrough: The spoils system becomes the framework for the entire alliance. Not just a muster—a formal compact where Christian lords pledge forces in exchange for guaranteed shares. Oleśnicki himself suggests formalizing it with ecclesiastical blessing. What began as a proposal becomes the constitutional basis for the crusade itself.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

Concrete discussion begins about structuring the claims council.\n\nI should narrate this enthusiastic reception, showing each character's reaction according to their established personalities, and then stop when Juan needs to respond or when there's a natural decision point.\n\n\nRoll 79 — Enthusiastic Reception\n\n\n\nThe change is almost physical.\n\n\nÚjlaki leans forward, and you see the frontier lord's mind working—the man who told you privately that interior lords would find excuses, that only those who face the Ottomans daily would truly fight. Now his eyes sharpen with something like hunger.\n\n\n\"This,\" he says slowly, \"this changes everything.\"\n\n\nHe rises from his seat, moving to the map of Hungary and the Balkans spread across the table. His finger traces the lost territories—Serbia, the borderlands, the fortresses that have fallen to Ottoman advance over decades.\n\n\n\"The Garai claim ancestral rights to lands in Serbia. The Hunyadi have eyes on the same. The Rozgonyi, the Újlaki—my own house—we all have losses to avenge, lands our grandfathers held.\" He turns to face the council. \"But these are claims, not possessions. Empty words. If the king says: bring your men, stake your claim, and fight for what you want—then suddenly every lord in Hungary must ask himself: do I sit home and watch my rivals carve up the future? Or do I ride?\"\n\n\nKoniecpol strokes his grey beard, nodding slowly. \"Competition. You turn the muster from obligation into... auction. The more men you bring, the stronger your claim.\"\n\n\n\"Not auction,\" Újlaki corrects. \"Investment. A lord who brings five hundred cavalry has invested five hundred cavalry in this war's success. He cannot afford for us to lose. He will fight.\"\n\n\nTarnowski shifts uncomfortably. \"And the szlachta? Those of us without great estates to field armies?\"\n\n\n\"Smaller claims,\" Újlaki answers without hesitation. \"A village. A mill. A title of minor nobility in reconquered lands. A man who brings twenty horse cannot claim a fortress—but he can claim something. And twenty horse here, thirty there...\" He spreads his hands. \"It adds.\"\n\n\nOleśnicki has been silent, his hawk's face unreadable. When he speaks, his voice carries the weight of careful consideration.\n\n\n\"You propose to harness greed in service of God's work.\" It is not quite an accusation. \"The Church has... experience with such arrangements. The Teutonic Knights built their state on granted lands. The Spanish orders—\" he nods to you \"—were rewarded with estates carved from the Moors.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, fingers steepled.\n\n\n\"I will not oppose this. But the Church must have its share. Bishoprics restored. Monasteries endowed. The spiritual reconquest matters as much as the temporal. And there must be arbitration—a council to resolve competing claims before swords are drawn between allies.\"\n\n\n\"The Church's share is just,\" Władysław says quickly, seizing the moment of consensus. \"And arbitration—yes. We cannot have Hungarian lords fighting each other over Serbian castles while the Sultan watches and laughs.\"\n\n\nThe young king looks around the table, scarcely believing the transformation. Ten minutes ago, his council was fractured. Now they are debating implementation, not principle.\n\n\n\"King Juan.\" Władysław turns to you, something like wonder in his voice. \"In Castile, when you divided the spoils of Granada—how did you structure the claims? How did you prevent disputes among your own lords?\"\n\n\nThe council waits, quills poised. What worked in Iberia may work in the Balkans."

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed Juan's sophisticated spoils system and anticipated council concerns.\n\nJuan is explaining his spoils system in detail. This is a complex proposal with several components:\n\n1. A points system for military contribution (1 point per footman, 3 for light cavalry, 5 for heavy cavalry)\n2. A sworn oath to maintain contribution throughout the war, with forfeiture for those who don't\n3. An auction/bidding system for lands and titles using muster points\n4. Conditional installation - only finalized at war's end\n5. War ends when Ottomans are driven from European continent (very ambitious!)\n6. Question about Hungarian free men owning land and potentially including them\n\nThis is quite detailed and sophisticated. I need to think about how the council would react to each element:\n\n**Positive elements:**\n- Clear, transparent system\n- Prevents disputes through formal bidding\n- Accountability mechanism (forfeiture clause)\n- Sophisticated and well-thought-out\n- Shows Juan has experience with this\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- The \"war ends when Ottomans driven from Europe\" is EXTREMELY ambitious - this could take decades or never happen\n- The forfeiture clause is harsh - what about lords who lose men to disease or desertion through no fault of their own?\n- The free men question touches on sensitive social issues\n- Hungarian society is different from Castilian - do they have a tradition of free peasant landholders?\n\nLet me think about Hungarian social structure. Hungary had a complex system:\n- Magnates (great nobles)\n- Lesser nobility (köznemesség) - actually quite numerous\n- Free cities and their burghers\n- Peasants - some free, many tied to land\n\nThe \"noble\" class in Hungary was actually quite broad - the lesser nobility (szlachta equivalent) were numerous. There were also \"hajdú\" - free soldiers who could earn noble status through military service. \n\nThe question about free men is interesting because Hungary did have traditions of military service leading to social advancement. The later hajdú system (16th century) formalized this, but the concept existed earlier.\n\n\nThe proposal threatens the nobility's traditional monopoly on land and status, which could make Tarnowski and other szlachta representatives uneasy about elevating commoners. The council will likely respond positively to the framework itself, but they'll press on practical details—particularly the vague endpoint of driving Ottomans entirely from Europe and how harshly the forfeiture clause applies to circumstances beyond a lord's control. This is refinement of an already-accepted concept, so no formal decision is needed here.\n\n\nThe scribes write furiously, struggling to keep pace. Újlaki has risen from his seat entirely now, pacing as he listens, his mind clearly racing through implications.\n\n\n\"The counting system is elegant,\" Koniecpol says, his veteran's eye appreciating the military logic. \"In Poland, we might weight our husaria more heavily—a winged hussar is worth more than five ordinary horsemen in a charge. But the principle is sound. Agreed contribution, recorded, sworn.\"\n\n\n\"The forfeiture clause,\" Újlaki says, stopping his pacing. \"This is the teeth of the thing. A lord who pledges five hundred and arrives with two hundred and fifty loses everything he bid upon.\" He nods slowly. \"No more convenient illnesses when the march grows hard. No more 'my men were needed at home.' You are in, or you are out.\"\n\n\n\"Casualties counting toward the muster—this is fair,\" Tarnowski adds, surprising you with his support. \"A lord who loses men in honest battle should not be punished for the fortunes of war. Only cowardice or betrayal forfeits the claim.\"\n\n\nOleśnicki, however, has fixed on something else. His quill taps against parchment.\n\n\n\"You say the conflict ends for Hungary when the Ottomans are driven from the European continent.\" The Bishop's voice is carefully neutral. \"That is... an ambitious definition, Your Majesty of Castile. Constantinople. Thrace. Greece. The Balkans entire. This could be the work of a decade. Two decades. A lifetime.\"\n\n\nHe lets the words hang.\n\n\n\"A lord who bids his muster on Serbian lands in 1440 may be an old man—or a dead one—before the Ottomans are pushed across the Bosphorus. His son inherits the claim? His grandson? What happens to pledged lands if the original claimant dies before the condition is fulfilled?\"\n\n\nÚjlaki waves a hand. \"Details for the lawyers. The principle matters—we do not declare victory until victory is complete. No half-measures. No treaties that give back what we have bled for.\"\n\n\n\"The Bishop raises a fair point nonetheless,\" Władysław interjects thoughtfully. \"Perhaps... perhaps we define stages. Serbia liberated—first stage, those claims finalized. Bulgaria—second stage. And so forth. A lord need not wait until Constantinople itself falls to receive what he has earned.\"\n\n\nThe council murmurs approval at this modification.\n\n\nThen Koniecpol clears his throat, addressing your final question.\n\n\n\"Free men owning land.\" The old hetman exchanges a glance with Tarnowski. \"In Poland, the szlachta are the free men who own land and owe military service. Below them...\" He shrugs. \"Peasants. Bound to their lords, mostly. A free peasant with his own farm is rare.\"\n\n\n\"Hungary is similar,\" Újlaki adds. \"Though we have the hajdúk—free warriors, cattle drivers, men who live outside the feudal bonds. Rough men. Useful in a fight.\" He strokes his chin. \"If we offered them land in reconquered territories in exchange for service... we could field thousands more. But—\"\n\n\n\"But the magnates would not like common soldiers becoming landholders beside them,\" Tarnowski finishes bluntly. \"In Poland, the szlachta would never accept peasants elevated to their status through mere fighting. Our liberties are ours. Earned by blood and birth across generations.\"\n\n\nOleśnicki nods slowly. \"The Church has no objection to freemen holding land—indeed, free Christian farmers in reconquered territories would be a blessing. But the nobility may see it as... dilution.\"\n\n\nÚjlaki is quiet for a moment, then speaks carefully.\n\n\n\"In Hungary, the frontier changes a man's thinking. I have seen hajdúk fight as bravely as any knight. If a common man will march to Serbia and hold a farm against Turkish raiders with his own sword arm...\" He shrugs. \"I would rather have him as a neighbor than leave the land empty for the Sultan to reclaim.\"\n\n\n\"This is a matter for each kingdom to decide for itself,\" Władysław says diplomatically. \"What works in Constantinople may not suit Poland. What Hungary permits, the szlachta may reject.\" He looks to you. \"But the core system—the muster count, the bidding, the sworn commitment—this we can adopt. The question of free men we can... consider separately.\"\n\n\nThe young king straightens, and for a moment he looks every inch the ruler of two kingdoms.\n\n\n\"Gentlemen. We have the bones of something here. A system that makes every lord an investor in victory. I propose we establish a formal council—here in Kraków, next year, before the campaign season of 1441. Hungarian and Polish lords together. We count the muster. We hear the bids. We record the oaths.\" He looks around the table. \"Are we agreed in principle?\"\n\n\nKoniecpol nods. Újlaki nods. Even Tarnowski, after a moment's hesitation, inclines his head.\n\n\nAll eyes turn to Oleśnicki.\n\n\nThe Bishop is silent for a long moment. Then, slowly, he dips his quill and makes a note on the parchment before him.\n\n\n\"The Church will require its guarantees in writing. Bishoprics, monasteries, ecclesiastical lands—these are not subject to bidding. They are restored to their proper stewards.\" He looks up. \"With that understood... I do not oppose.\"\n\n\nWładysław releases a breath he did not seem to know he was holding.\n\n\n\"Then we are agreed.\" The young king turns to you, and there is genuine gratitude in his eyes. \"King Juan, you came to Poland seeking allies for a war. I think perhaps you have given us something more valuable—a way to win it.\""

I should have the council members respond with their expertise about their own kingdoms.\n\nLet me think about what would be historically appropriate:\n\n**Poland:**\n- Kraków was the capital and royal seat in the 15th century, not Warsaw\n- Warsaw was a much smaller city at this time - it only became the capital later (1596)\n- Kraków makes more sense as a muster point for Poland\n\n**Hungary:**\n- Buda was indeed the capital of Hungary in this period\n- However, for a campaign heading south toward Serbia/Ottoman territories, a more southern location might make military sense\n- Places like Szeged, or even somewhere in the southern frontier might be considered\n\nThe NPCs should correct Juan on Warsaw (which wouldn't be the obvious choice in 1439) and discuss the merits of various locations based on:\n- Logistics (feeding assembled armies)\n- Geography (distance to the campaign theater)\n- Politics (symbolic importance)\n- Practical concerns (space to camp, nearby resources)\n\nLet me have the council respond naturally to this question.\n\n\nKoniecpol shakes his head, a faint smile crossing his weathered face.\n\n\n\"Warsaw? Warsaw is a market town, Your Majesty. A river crossing.\" He gestures vaguely northward. \"The royal seat is here—Kraków. If Polish lords muster anywhere, they muster where the king sits. And Kraków is closer to Hungary besides, closer to the road south.\"\n\n\n\"For Hungary, Buda makes sense politically,\" Újlaki says slowly, \"but not militarily. Buda is in the center of the kingdom—lords from the north must march there, then march south again to reach the campaign.\" He traces a finger across the map. \"If we muster at Buda, we add weeks to the march. Weeks of eating through supplies before we even see a Turk.\"\n\n\nHe taps a point further south on the Hungarian plain.\n\n\n\"Szeged. On the Tisza river, near the southern frontier. The lords march toward the war, not away from it. Those who arrive first can begin organizing while the others catch up. And it sends a message—we gather not in comfortable Buda, but at the edge of Christian lands. The war is here.\"\n\n\n\"There is also the matter of feeding thirty thousand men,\" Tarnowski adds pragmatically. \"Kraków can support a muster—the city is large, the countryside rich. But even here, an army cannot sit for long without stripping the land bare. Szeged...\" He looks to Újlaki.\n\n\n\"Szeged is smaller,\" the Ban admits. \"But the Hungarian plain is fertile, and the Tisza brings supplies easily by boat. For a muster of weeks, not months, it will serve.\"\n\n\nWładysław considers the map thoughtfully.\n\n\n\"Two musters, then. Kraków for Poland. Szeged for Hungary. Close enough that coordination is possible, far enough that we do not strain one region's resources.\" He looks up. \"The Polish lords gather here, the Hungarian lords at Szeged. Then both hosts march to meet... where?\"\n\n\nÚjlaki's finger traces south from Szeged, across the Danube, toward the Serbian lands.\n\n\n\"Belgrade. The gateway to Serbia. If we take Belgrade, we control the Danube crossing. The combined host meets there—and from Belgrade, we strike into Ottoman territory.\""

The muster in 1440 is just for counting forces and dividing up the claims/titles. The actual campaign where the armies combine and march on Serbia is in 1441, after the Ottoman truce expires.\n\nThis is an important clarification - the muster is a preparatory administrative exercise, not the beginning of the campaign itself.\n\n\nÚjlaki pauses, then laughs—a short, sharp sound of a man catching himself getting ahead of the game.\n\n\n\"Forgive me.

This is a persuasion attempt that needs a d100 table.\n\nLet me assess this using the persuasion skill framework:\n\n**The Ask:**\nSend promising Hungarian and Polish nobles to Juan's military academy in Toledo for training in anti-Ottoman tactics, to foster cooperation between the allied armies.\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- The council has just agreed to a comprehensive alliance framework—goodwill is high\n- Juan has demonstrated military expertise (Reconquista, Naples campaign)\n- The academy exists and has proven results (mentioned in Book 1)\n- Practical benefit: learning Ottoman tactics from someone who has studied them\n- Creates personal bonds between young nobles who will fight together\n- Juan frames it humbly: \"educate,\" \"cooperation,\" \"stay loyal to their nominal lord\"\n- Władysław is young and eager to learn from Juan—he may want to send men\n- Frontier lords like Újlaki who face Ottomans would value practical training\n- Juan has already shared wisdom (the hunting conversation about leading charges)\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- Sending nobles to a foreign kingdom creates hostage potential (medieval concern)\n- Polish/Hungarian pride: \"We know how to fight, we don't need Castilians to teach us\"\n- Distance: Toledo is incredibly far from Poland/Hungary—months of travel each way\n- Cost of sending nobles across Europe for a year\n- Precedent: are we becoming subordinate to Castile?\n- Oleśnicki will worry about foreign influence on Polish nobility\n- The szlachta are fiercely independent—being \"students\" may feel demeaning\n- Hungary has its own military traditions (light cavalry, frontier warfare)\n- Poland has the hussars and their own proud martial culture\n- Some may see this as Juan asserting himself as teacher/master over \"students\"\n- Young nobles sent away for a year miss opportunities at home\n- What if they come back with foreign ideas that don't fit local conditions?\n\n\n- The approach is sound—Juan's being diplomatic about it, positioning this as mutual education rather than instruction, and he's careful to note these men stay answerable to their own rulers. Still, the distance is a real problem and pride cuts deep with medieval nobility.\n\nThe balance here is genuinely uncertain. The military reasoning is solid, but practical obstacles and wounded pride are substantial barriers. Medieval nobles resist being positioned as learners under foreign masters. I need a table that captures this tension—one where success isn't guaranteed but isn't impossible either.\n\nThe scale should reflect that rejection based on pride or suspicion is plausible, as is polite deflection about maintaining their own traditions. Practical obstacles like distance and expense could dominate the discussion. There's room for modified interest—perhaps Juan sends instructors instead of requiring travel. Limited agreement with a few volunteers is realistic, as is genuine agreement with conditions attached. Strong commitment from both sides is possible but less likely. The middle range feels most probable here.\n\n\nPersuasion Assessment: Military Academy Exchange\n\n\nThe Ask:\nSend promising Hungarian and Polish nobles to Juan's military academy in Toledo to train in anti-Ottoman warfare and foster cooperation between the allied armies before the 1441 campaign.\n\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nCouncil is in excellent spirits after the successful spoils system discussion\n\nJuan has demonstrated proven military expertise (Reconquista, Naples)\n\nThe academy exists and has produced results—it's not theoretical\n\nPractical value: Juan has actually studied Ottoman tactics and defeated Muslim armies\n\nCreates personal bonds between young nobles who will fight side-by-side\n\nJuan frames it humbly: \"educate,\" \"cooperation,\" explicitly states they remain loyal to their own lords\n\nWładysław personally admires Juan and has sought his mentorship\n\nFrontier lords like Újlaki understand the value of knowing your enemy\n\nUnified command requires officers who understand each other's methods\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nSending nobles abroad creates potential hostages—a serious medieval concern\n\nPride: \"We Poles/Hungarians know how to fight—we don't need foreigners to teach us\"\n\nDistance: Toledo is months away—across the Alps, through hostile or indifferent lands\n\nCost of maintaining nobles abroad for an extended period\n\nYoung nobles miss a year of opportunities at home (marriages, inheritances, court politics)\n\nHungary has its own martial traditions (light cavalry, frontier warfare)—will Castilian methods even apply?\n\nPoland's hussars are legendary—being \"students\" may feel demeaning to proud szlachta\n\nOleśnicki will worry about foreign influence on impressionable young nobles\n\nCreates appearance of subordination: Castile teaches, Poland/Hungary learns\n\nWhat if they return with ideas that contradict local military customs?\n\nThe Moravian passage showed how difficult overland travel can be\n\n\nApproach Quality:\nGood but faces structural obstacles. Juan is diplomatic and humble, but the sheer distance and the pride factor are significant barriers that words alone may not overcome.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll: Reception of the Academy Proposal\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-8\nPride Prevails: Tarnowski speaks for wounded szlachta honor—\"Polish knights have nothing to learn from Castilians about war.\" Koniecpol, despite his pragmatism, cannot openly contradict this without insulting his own nation's military tradition. The proposal is politely but firmly declined.\n9-18\nSuspicion and Distance: Oleśnicki raises concerns about young nobles in a foreign court, far from family and Church oversight. The practical difficulties of the journey—months each way through uncertain territory—make it seem impractical. Interest, but no commitment.\n19-30\n\"We Have Our Own Ways\": The military men acknowledge Juan's expertise but suggest their own traditions serve them well. Perhaps Juan could send written materials instead? Or a few instructors to visit? The full academy exchange is gently deflected.\n31-45\nCounter-Proposal: The council sees merit but suggests reversing the flow—could Castilian officers come here to train alongside Polish and Hungarian forces? This keeps nobles home while still fostering cooperation. Juan's proposal is transformed rather than accepted.\n46-60\nLimited Interest: Újlaki offers to send a few Hungarian frontier lords' sons—men who face Ottomans and have no illusions about their need to learn. The Poles are more reserved. A handful of volunteers, perhaps, but no formal program.\n61-75\nConditional Agreement: The council agrees in principle. Oleśnicki requires Church oversight—a chaplain must accompany any Polish nobles. Numbers will be modest. The arrangement is framed as \"exchange\" rather than \"instruction\"—perhaps Castilian nobles could visit Poland in return?\n76-88\nGenuine Enthusiasm: Władysław himself expresses wish to send promising young knights. Újlaki commits to Hungarian participation. Koniecpol suggests specific names—young officers with potential. A formal program begins to take shape, with details to be arranged.\n89-95\nStrong Commitment: Both kingdoms commit to sending contingents of young nobles. The academy becomes part of the alliance framework itself—a symbol of unity. Discussion turns to logistics: how many, when they depart, what they will learn.\n96-100\nBeyond Expectations: The proposal sparks a larger vision. Perhaps a permanent exchange—Polish, Hungarian, and Castilian officers rotating through each other's forces. Władysław suggests he might send his own household knights. The academy becomes an institution binding the crusade together.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

The council is already in high spirits from the spoils system success, so this builds on that momentum.\n\n\nRoll 85 — Genuine Enthusiasm\n\n\n\nWładysław reacts before his council can.\n\n\n\"Yes.\" The word comes quickly, the young king leaning forward with undisguised eagerness. \"I have heard of your academy—the foreign masters you brought to Toledo. Hunyadi himself taught there, did he not? Before he returned to Hungary?\"\n\n\nÚjlaki's head turns sharply at the name. \"János Hunyadi trained Castilian officers?\"\n\n\n\"For a year,\" you confirm. \"He taught cavalry tactics. How the Hungarians fight. How the Turks fight. He was one of several masters—Italian, German, French. The goal was to learn from everyone.\"\n\n\nThe Ban of Macsó sits back, reassessing. \"Hunyadi never mentioned this.\" A pause. \"Though he does not mention much. A private man.\" His expression shifts to something more calculating. \"If the academy was good enough for János Hunyadi to teach at... then it is good enough for Hungarian lords to learn at.\"\n\n\nKoniecpol strokes his beard thoughtfully. \"The journey is long. Months through the mountains, through lands that—as your own passage through Moravia showed—are not always friendly to crusaders.\" He raises a hand before objection can form. \"But I do not say this to refuse. I say it because we must plan carefully. The young men we send must travel in sufficient numbers to be safe. Perhaps they join your own party when you return west?\"\n\n\n\"I can name three young knights immediately,\" the old hetman continues, warming to the idea. \"Piotr Szafraniec—sharp mind, good seat on a horse, needs tempering. Andrzej Tęczyński—brave to the point of foolishness, would benefit from discipline. Mikołaj Lanckoroński—quieter, watches everything, learns fast.\" He glances at Władysław. \"With Your Majesty's permission, of course.\"\n\n\n\"Granted freely,\" Władysław says. Then, with a trace of wistfulness: \"I wish I could go myself. To see Castile. To train alongside men who completed the Reconquista.\" He shakes his head slightly. \"But a king cannot absent himself for a year. Not with war coming.\"\n\n\n\"Hungary will send men,\" Újlaki declares firmly. \"Frontier families. The Hunyadis have a younger son—László, perhaps fourteen now. Too young? No matter, there are others. The Szilágyi produce good soldiers. The Rozgonyi as well.\" He looks at you directly. \"I will write to the lords myself. Frame it as an honor, not a obligation. The chance to train with the Defensor Romaniae, the conqueror of Granada. They will compete for the privilege.\"\n\n\nOleśnicki, predictably, interjects. \"The young men will require spiritual guidance. A chaplain must accompany the Polish contingent—someone to ensure they do not stray from proper devotion in a foreign land.\" His tone suggests this is non-negotiable.\n\n\n\"Of course,\" Władysław agrees easily. \"Father Stanisław, perhaps. He is young enough to survive the journey and wise enough to guide the knights.\"\n\n\nTarnowski clears his throat. \"The szlachta will want to know their sons are treated with proper honor. Not as... students sitting at the feet of a foreign master, but as allies learning alongside Castilian knights. Equals in dignity, if not yet in experience.\"\n\n\n\"That is precisely how my academy functions,\" you can assure him. \"Knights train together. They learn from each other. A Polish hussar knows things about cavalry warfare that my Castilians do not. The exchange goes both ways.\"\n\n\nThis seems to satisfy the szlachta representative.\n\n\n\"Then we are agreed,\" Władysław says, scarcely containing his satisfaction. \"Poland and Hungary will send young knights to Toledo. They will travel with King Juan when he departs, or follow shortly after. They will train through the winter and return in time for the 1440 muster, bearing what they have learned.\"\n\n\nHe turns to the scribes. \"Record this. Let it be part of the formal alliance—an exchange of military knowledge between the crowns. Our sons will learn to fight as brothers before they bleed as brothers.\"\n\n\nThe quills scratch against parchment, recording another piece of the growing edifice."

They want me to identify all factions that could:\n1. Ally with the Ottomans against the crusade\n2. Act independently against Juan's interests\n\nLet me think through the geopolitical situation in 1439-1441:\n\n**The Ottomans (Sultan Murad II)**\n- The primary enemy\n- Currently holding much of the Balkans, Anatolia\n- Has been dealing with internal issues (he actually abdicated briefly in history around this time)\n\n**Potential Ottoman Allies or Independent Threats:**\n\n1. **Mamluk Sultanate (Egypt/Syria)**\n- Major Muslim power\n- Controls Egypt, the Levant, parts of Arabia\n- Historically sometimes allied with Ottomans, sometimes rivals\n- They would be concerned about a major Christian crusade\n- However, they also compete with Ottomans for leadership of the Islamic world\n\n2. **Hafsid Sultanate (Tunisia)**\n- North African Muslim state\n- Could threaten Castilian/Aragonese Mediterranean interests\n- Naval power\n\n3. **Marinid Sultanate (Morocco)**\n- In decline by this period, but still exists\n- Close to Castilian territory\n- Could potentially raid or cause trouble\n\n4. **Emirate of Granada** - Wait, in this timeline Granada has fallen (1433). So this isn't a factor.\n\n5. **Timurids**\n- Far to the east, probably not directly relevant\n- They actually weakened the Ottomans at Ankara (1402), so unlikely to help them\n\n6. **Karamanids (Anatolian Beylik)**\n- Actually often opposed to the Ottomans\n- Could be potential allies FOR the crusade, not against\n\n7. **Venice**\n- Complex relationship\n- They trade heavily with the Ottomans\n- A crusade disrupts their commerce\n- They might not actively oppose, but might not help either\n\n\n- Could be unreliable \"allies\"\n\n8. **Genoa**\n- Similar to Venice - commercial interests in the East\n- Galata (across from Constantinople) is Genoese\n- They might be ambivalent\n\n9. **Serbian Despotate (Đurađ Branković)**\n- Actually a potential ally - they're the ones to be liberated\n- Though they've been Ottoman vassals at times\n\n10. **Wallachia/Moldavia**\n- Christian principalities, but sometimes Ottoman vassals\n- Could go either way\n\n11. **Byzantine Empire**\n- Weakened but still exists\n- Might support the crusade, or might be wary of Western intentions\n- Their position is precarious\n\nThe key insight here is that most potential opposition falls into two categories: established Muslim powers who'd naturally oppose a crusade, and Christian states with conflicting commercial or political interests. Venice and Genoa are particularly important wildcards—their trade networks with Ottoman territories give them incentive to avoid disruption, making them potentially obstructive despite nominal Christian allegiance. The maritime republics—Venice and Genoa—present complications since their trade networks might pull them toward neutrality or even obstruction. The Balkan states like Serbia and Wallachia face a difficult choice between supporting the crusade and avoiding Ottoman retaliation. The Karamanids in Anatolia could potentially be leveraged to strike the Ottomans from behind, though their willingness remains uncertain. I should present these options to see which ones warrant rolling for outcomes.\n\n\nA wise strategic consideration. Let me compile the factions that could oppose or complicate the crusade:\n\n\n\nPRIMARY ENEMY\n\n\nOttoman Empire (Sultan Murad II) — The target of the crusade. Their response, preparedness, and strategic choices will be critical.\n\n\n\nMAJOR MUSLIM POWERS\n\n\nMamluk Sultanate (Egypt & Syria) — The other great Muslim power. Controls Egypt, the Levant, the Holy Cities. Historically rivals with the Ottomans for Islamic leadership, but a major Christian crusade might unite them. They have a powerful navy and could threaten Cyprus, Rhodes, or crusader supply lines.\n\nHafsid Sultanate (Tunisia) — North African state, capable naval power. Could raid Aragonese Sicily, Sardinia, or threaten Mediterranean shipping lanes.\n\nMarinid Sultanate (Morocco) — In decline but still present. Closest Muslim power to Castile itself. Could attempt raids on the Andalusian coast while Juan is away, or support corsair activity.\n\n\n\nCHRISTIAN WILD CARDS\n\n\nRepublic of Venice — They trade extensively with the Ottomans. War disrupts their commerce. They might nominally support a crusade while secretly hoping it fails, or actively undermine it to protect their trading privileges. They also have interests in the Aegean and Adriatic that might conflict with crusade objectives.\n\nRepublic of Genoa — Similar commercial concerns. They hold Galata across from Constantinople and various Aegean colonies. Their interests are complex and not necessarily aligned with a crusade that might upset the balance of power.\n\nWallachia (Vlad II Dracul) — Christian principality, but currently an Ottoman vassal. Will they join the crusade, stay neutral, or be compelled to fight for the Sultan?\n\nSerbia (Despot Đurađ Branković) — The territory you plan to liberate. But Đurađ has survived by balancing between powers. Will he welcome liberation or fear that failed crusade means Ottoman retribution?\n\n\n\nPOTENTIAL OTTOMAN ALLIES IN ANATOLIA\n\n\nAnatolian Beyliks (Karaman, etc.) — Various Turkish principalities. Some hate the Ottomans, some might rally to them against Christian invasion. The Karamanids in particular are historically Ottoman rivals—they could be induced to attack from the east, or they might calculate that a weakened Ottoman state leaves them vulnerable next.\n\n\n\nPOLITICAL COMPLICATIONS\n\n\nCouncil of Basel vs. Pope Eugenius IV — The ongoing schism in the Church. If the Council opposes Eugenius's crusade bull, it could divide Christian support and create political obstacles in the Empire and France.\n\nRené of Anjou & French Interests — Juan defeated René in Naples. France is embroiled in the Hundred Years' War, but René might seek revenge or attempt to reclaim Naples while Juan is occupied in the East.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY LIST FOR ROLLS:\n\n#\nFaction\nPrimary Concern\n1\nOttoman Empire\nMilitary response and preparation\n2\nMamluk Sultanate\nIntervention or neutrality?\n3\nHafsid Sultanate\nMediterranean raiding?\n4\nMarinid Sultanate\nThreat to Castilian coast?\n5\nVenice\nCooperation or sabotage?\n6\nGenoa\nCooperation or sabotage?\n7\nWallachia\nJoin crusade or fight for Ottomans?\n8\nSerbia\nActive support or fearful neutrality?\n9\nKaramanid Beylik\nAttack Ottomans from east or stay neutral?\n10\nCouncil of Basel\nSupport or oppose papal crusade bull?\n11\nRené of Anjou\nAttempt to retake Naples?\n\n\nWhich factions would you like to roll for?

Sultan Murad II has just received a letter from Juan II of Castile (co-signed by Władysław III of Poland-Hungary) declaring that the truce will end in 1441 and a state of war will exist.\n\nI need to think about the Ottoman situation in 1439:\n- Murad II is the Sultan\n- The Ottomans have been expanding in the Balkans\n- They have a powerful military (janissaries, sipahi cavalry)\n- They face potential threats from multiple directions (Balkans, Anatolia)\n- They have dealt with crusades before (Nicopolis 1396, Varna 1444 historically)\n- They have naval capabilities but not Mediterranean dominance\n- They have various vassal states (Wallachia, Serbia to some extent)\n\nThe letter tells Murad:\n- The truce ends in 1441\n- Castile and Poland-Hungary are allied\n- This is a formal declaration of coming war\n\nMurad's strategic options might include:\n1. Aggressive - Strike first before the crusaders can assemble\n2. Defensive - Prepare fortifications, gather forces, wait for them to come\n3. Diplomatic - Try to break up the alliance, negotiate separately with parties\n4. Divide and conquer - Attack one party before the others can join\n5. Seek allies - Reach out to Mamluks, other Muslim powers\n6. Internal consolidation - Deal with potential Anatolian threats first\n\nLet me draft a d100 table for Ottoman strategy, then another for how well they execute it.\n\n\nOTTOMAN EMPIRE — Strategic Assessment\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\nSultan Murad II has received a formal declaration that the truce agreed at Tenedos will end in 1441. The letter is signed by both Juan II of Castile (Defensor Romaniae, conqueror of Granada, holder of five crowns) and Władysław III (King of Poland and Hungary). This represents the most serious Christian military threat the Ottomans have faced since the Crusade of Nicopolis in 1396.\n\n\nWhat Murad Knows:\n\n\nCastile has completed the Reconquista and possesses a battle-hardened army\n\nJuan has already intervened in Constantinople, establishing Latin settlement rights\n\nPoland-Hungary controls the northern approach to the Balkans\n\nA two-front war (naval from the west, land from the north) is coming\n\nHe has approximately 18 months to prepare\n\n\nStrategic Options:\n\n\nMurad must choose his approach. The Ottomans are not passive—they are a sophisticated military state with experienced commanders and a tradition of strategic thinking.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #1: Ottoman Strategic Choice\n\nRoll\nStrategy\n1-10\nComplacency: Murad dismisses the threat. Christians have made grand declarations before—Nicopolis proved their crusades are disorganized and beatable. Minimal additional preparation; routine defensive posture. The Sultan focuses on hunting and court matters.\n11-20\nDiplomatic Division: Murad prioritizes breaking the alliance. Generous peace offers to Poland-Hungary (return some frontier fortresses, prisoner releases, trade concessions). Attempt to isolate Castile as a distant foreign meddler. Delay military preparation pending diplomatic results.\n21-35\nDefensive Consolidation: Murad accepts war is coming and prepares to receive it. Strengthen Serbian and Bulgarian fortresses. Stockpile supplies. Gather the provincial armies. Let the Christians exhaust themselves marching to meet Ottoman strength on home ground.\n36-50\nAggressive Defense: Fortify the frontiers but also prepare mobile forces to strike at crusader supply lines and raid their staging areas. Make the cost of invasion clear before the main armies even meet. Scorched earth in border regions if necessary.\n51-65\nPre-emptive Strike: Why wait for 1441? Attack Hungary in 1440 while the crusaders are still mustering. Defeat Władysław before Castilian forces can arrive. Present Juan with a fait accompli—his ally broken, his campaign pointless.\n66-80\nStrategic Depth: Prepare multiple defensive lines. If Serbia falls, fall back to Bulgaria. If Bulgaria falls, fall back to Thrace. Trade space for time, bleeding the crusaders at every step while preserving the core Ottoman army for a decisive counterstroke.\n81-90\nCoalition Building: Reach out to the Mamluks, the Hafsids, the Karamanids. A Christian crusade threatens all Muslim powers—unite them. Coordinate naval harassment from North Africa. Promise Karaman peace in exchange for neutrality or support. Build an Islamic alliance to match the Christian one.\n91-100\nGrand Strategy: Murad implements a comprehensive plan—diplomatic outreach to potential Christian defectors (Venice, Genoa), military preparation on all fronts, coalition building with Muslim powers, intelligence operations to learn crusader plans, and preparation of multiple strategic options depending on how events unfold. The full resources of the Ottoman state mobilize for existential war.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Ottoman Strategic Choice."

This is a remarkably fortunate roll for Juan's crusade - Murad dismisses the threat and makes minimal preparations.\n\nNow I need to create a second table to determine how well this complacent strategy \"succeeds\" - or rather, how this plays out. Since the strategy is complacency, the roll will determine whether Murad's advisors manage to shake him out of it, whether events force a change, or whether the Ottomans truly remain unprepared.\n\nLet me think about this carefully:\n\n- If the \"success\" roll is low, it might mean that even the complacent strategy encounters problems - perhaps advisors rebel, or local commanders take initiative despite the Sultan's inaction\n- If the \"success\" roll is high, the complacency fully takes hold - the Ottoman state genuinely fails to prepare, giving the crusaders a major advantage\n\nActually, I need to think about this differently. The question is: how well does this complacent approach serve the Ottomans? Or alternatively: does Murad remain complacent, or do events/advisors force him to change course?\n\nI think the second roll should determine:\n1. Whether the complacency persists or is challenged\n2. What consequences unfold from this strategic choice\n\nLet me draft a table for how the complacent strategy plays out over the 18 months before the crusade.\n\n\nRoll 8 — Complacency\n\n\n\nMurad II reads the letter in his palace at Edirne. The Arabic is formal, correct, even courteous. The threat is unmistakable.\n\n\nThe Sultan sets it aside and calls for his falconer.\n\n\nHe has seen Christian declarations before. The Pope calls crusades every few years—it is what Popes do. The German Emperor makes grand pronouncements. The Venetians talk of holy war while their merchants buy Ottoman silk. And the results? Nicopolis. Varna will be no different.\n\n\nThe Castilian king is far away—months of sailing, his army untested against Turkish arms. The Poles are brave but disorganized. The Hungarians are divided, their magnates more interested in fighting each other than fighting Turks. Murad has spent twenty years managing Christian threats. They always fragment. They always quarrel. They always go home.\n\n\nHis viziers counsel preparation. His generals request reinforcements for the frontier. Murad listens, nods, and does little. The provincial sipahi will answer when called. The janissaries are always ready. There is no need to disrupt the realm's economy with premature mobilization.\n\n\nThe hunting is excellent this autumn. The Sultan rides out three times a week.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #2: Consequences of Complacency\n\n\nThis roll determines how the Ottoman lack of preparation manifests over the 18 months before the crusade, and whether anything forces Murad to reconsider.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nAwakening Too Late: Advisors and frontier commanders grow alarmed as intelligence reports confirm the crusade is real. By the time Murad accepts the threat, it is late 1440—mobilization begins frantically, but the Ottomans will meet the crusade under-strength and poorly positioned. Significant strategic advantage to the crusaders.\n11-25\nPersistent Complacency: Murad's confidence proves infectious. The Ottoman court settles into routine. Frontier garrisons are maintained but not reinforced. No additional fortifications. No stockpiling. When war comes, the Ottomans fight with what they have—formidable, but not what they could have fielded with proper preparation.\n26-40\nUneven Preparation: Some Ottoman commanders take initiative despite the Sultan's disinterest. The Serbian fortresses receive some reinforcement; the navy conducts routine patrols. But there is no coordinated strategy, no central direction. Ottoman response to the crusade will be fragmented—some sectors strong, others weak.\n41-55\nLate Partial Mobilization: By mid-1440, the scale of crusader preparations becomes undeniable. Murad finally orders mobilization, but months have been lost. The Ottoman army will be ready, but rushed—less supplies stockpiled, fewer allies contacted, defensive positions incomplete. A moderate disadvantage.\n56-70\nVizier's Initiative: Grand Vizier Çandarlı Halil Pasha, alarmed by reports from spies, begins quiet preparations without troubling the Sultan. Fortresses are reinforced under guise of routine maintenance. Supplies are gathered as \"tax collection.\" When war comes, the Ottomans are better prepared than Murad's complacency deserved—but still below full readiness.\n71-85\nFalse Confidence Justified?: Perhaps Murad knows something. Hungarian magnates begin squabbling over claimed territories before the war even starts. Polish szlachta grumble about the foreign king's influence. The crusade's internal divisions become apparent, and Murad's contempt seems validated—until the armies actually march.\n86-95\nFrontier Incident Forces Action: A border clash—raiders, a skirmish, an ambitious bey seeking glory—escalates tensions early. Murad is forced to pay attention to the frontier despite himself. Preparation begins earlier than his complacency intended, partially offsetting his strategic error.\n96-100\nThe Sultan's Awakening: Something penetrates Murad's disinterest—a trusted advisor's warning, a prophetic dream, intelligence too alarming to ignore. By early 1440, the Sultan has reversed course completely. Full mobilization begins. The complacency was a temporary aberration; the Ottomans will be ready after all.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Consequences of Complacency."

The second roll should be about how well that minimal preparation goes, not whether he changes his mind. The roll should focus on:\n\n1. How effective are the minimal/routine preparations the Ottomans do make?\n2. Do individual commanders take initiative despite lack of central direction?\n3. Are there any complications or lucky breaks in their defensive posture?\n4. How does the frontier garrison situation evolve?\n\nThis is more of a chaos roll about the execution of \"business as usual\" rather than a strategic reconsideration. Let me revise the table to reflect this.\n\n\nYou're right. Murad has chosen complacency—the roll should reflect how well or poorly the minimal Ottoman preparations go, not whether he changes his mind. Let me revise:\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #2: Quality of Minimal Ottoman Preparations\n\n\nMurad is not mobilizing for war. But the Ottoman Empire is a functioning state with professional soldiers, experienced commanders, and frontier garrisons. This roll determines how effectively the routine military apparatus functions over the next 18 months, and whether individual commanders take initiative despite the Sultan's disinterest.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nNeglect Compounds: The Sultan's disinterest filters down. Frontier commanders, seeing no urgency from Edirne, grow lax. Garrison rotations are delayed. Supplies meant for fortresses are diverted by corrupt officials. When war comes, even the routine defenses are below standard. Serbian fortresses are undermanned; the Danube fleet is poorly maintained.\n16-30\nRoutine Only: The Ottoman military machine ticks over at its baseline level. No reinforcement, no stockpiling, no strategic coordination—but also no decay. Garrisons are maintained at peacetime strength. The janissaries drill as always. The sipahi tend their timars. The Ottomans will fight with their standing forces, nothing more.\n31-50\nUneven Initiative: Some frontier commanders—veterans who have faced Hungarian raids—quietly reinforce their own sectors. Others follow the Sultan's lead and do nothing. The result is a patchwork: some fortresses well-prepared, others neglected. The crusaders may find unexpected strength in some places, surprising weakness in others.\n51-70\nCapable Subordinates: Key commanders like Şehabeddin Pasha (Beylerbey of Rumelia) take professional initiative. Without direct orders, they conduct \"routine exercises,\" inspect fortifications, ensure supply caches are maintained. The Ottoman frontier is not mobilized for war, but it is professionally maintained. Peacetime readiness, competently executed.\n71-85\nIntelligence Advantage: Ottoman spies in Kraków, Venice, and Rome send detailed reports on crusader preparations. Even if Murad ignores them, his commanders do not. Frontier beys know what is coming and make quiet preparations. When war begins, the Ottomans are not surprised—they know crusader strength, routes, and timing.\n86-100\nHidden Strength: The Ottoman system is more resilient than it appears. Provincial forces can mobilize quickly when called. Fortress commanders have maintained secret reserves. The janissary corps is at peak readiness despite the Sultan's hunting trips. Complacency at the top has not infected the professional military class. When the call comes, the Ottomans will respond faster and stronger than anyone expected.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Quality of Minimal Ottoman Preparations."

Let me narrate that outcome briefly, then move on to the Mamluk Sultanate.\n\nThe outcome: Key commanders like Şehabeddin Pasha take professional initiative. Without direct orders, they conduct \"routine exercises,\" inspect fortifications, ensure supply caches are maintained. The Ottoman frontier is not mobilized for war, but it is professionally maintained. Peacetime readiness, competently executed.\n\nNow for the Mamluks - I need to assess their situation and create two rolls: their strategic choice and then how well it succeeds.\n\n\nRoll 52 — Capable Subordinates\n\n\n\nIn Edirne, the Sultan hunts. In Rumelia, Şehabeddin Pasha works.\n\n\nThe Beylerbey of Rumelia is a veteran of decades of frontier warfare. He has read the same intelligence reports the Sultan dismissed. He has spoken with merchants who passed through Kraków, with spies who watched the Castilian embassy arrive. He knows what is coming.\n\n\nWithout direct orders—for none have come—he conducts \"routine inspections\" of the Danubian fortresses. Garrison commanders are reminded of their duties. Supplies are checked and replenished where necessary. The river flotilla receives maintenance. Training exercises sharpen the provincial cavalry.\n\n\nNone of this is mobilization. Şehabeddin cannot call up the full provincial levy without the Sultan's command—that would be treason. But he can ensure that what forces exist are ready. He can make certain that when the call finally comes, his sector will respond professionally.\n\n\nSimilar quiet competence manifests elsewhere. The janissary aghas in Edirne maintain their corps at peak readiness regardless of the Sultan's mood—it is what janissaries do. Ottoman military professionalism runs deeper than any single ruler's attention.\n\n\nOttoman Status for 1441: Not mobilized, not reinforced, no grand strategy—but professionally maintained at peacetime readiness. Capable commanders will respond quickly when war begins, partially offsetting the lack of preparation. The crusaders will not face a crumbling defense, but neither will they face the full might of a mobilized Ottoman Empire.\n\n\n\nMAMLUK SULTANATE — Strategic Assessment\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\nSultan Barsbay rules Egypt and Syria, controlling the wealthiest Muslim state in the Mediterranean. The Mamluks are the protectors of Mecca and Medina, leaders of Sunni Islam, and historic rivals of the Ottomans for regional supremacy.\n\n\nWhat Barsbay Knows:\n\n\nA major Christian crusade is forming against the Ottomans\n\nThe crusaders include Castile (which destroyed Granada), Poland-Hungary, and presumably papal support\n\nConstantinople has received Latin reinforcement under this Castilian king\n\nIf the Ottomans fall, the Mamluks become the primary target of Christian expansion\n\nBut if the Ottomans are weakened without falling, Mamluk regional dominance increases\n\n\nMamluk Interests:\n\n\nProtecting Islamic holy sites and Mamluk prestige as defenders of the faith\n\nMaintaining lucrative trade routes (spices, silk) that Christians might disrupt\n\nPreventing Christian naval dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean\n\nPotentially benefiting from Ottoman weakness without committing to costly war\n\nCyprus (a Lusignan Christian kingdom) sits vulnerably close to Mamluk territory\n\n\nStrategic Options:\nThe Mamluks must decide: support fellow Muslims against the infidel crusade, exploit Ottoman distraction for their own gain, or remain neutral and see who wins?\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #1: Mamluk Strategic Choice\n\nRoll\nStrategy\n1-15\nHostile Neutrality to Ottomans: Barsbay sees opportunity. Let the Christians and Ottomans bleed each other. Perhaps raid Ottoman-allied shipping. Perhaps press claims in Syria while Murad is distracted. No aid to the Ottomans; quiet satisfaction at their troubles.\n16-30\nStrict Neutrality: The Mamluks stay out entirely. This is an Ottoman problem. Barsbay focuses on internal matters and trade. No support to either side. Watch and wait to see who emerges stronger.\n31-45\nDiplomatic Gestures Only: Barsbay sends messages of Islamic solidarity to Murad but commits no military resources. Prayers in the mosques for Ottoman victory. Perhaps financial gifts. But Mamluk soldiers stay home. Words, not swords.\n46-60\nCommercial Pressure: The Mamluks use their control of eastern trade to pressure Christian states. Threaten to cut off spice trade to Venice and Genoa if they support the crusade. Economic warfare rather than military intervention.\n61-75\nLimited Naval Cooperation: Barsbay offers naval support—Mamluk galleys to threaten crusader supply lines, raid Christian shipping, or coordinate with Ottoman naval forces. Limited commitment that pressures the crusaders without full war.\n76-85\nProxy Action via Cyprus: The Mamluks pressure or attack the Kingdom of Cyprus, forcing Christians to divert resources to defend it. Opens a second front without directly engaging the main crusade.\n86-95\nFull Islamic Solidarity: Barsbay commits to supporting the Ottomans militarily. Mamluk forces prepare to threaten Rhodes, Cyprus, or even crusader supply lines through the Mediterranean. A Muslim alliance against the Christian threat.\n96-100\nOpportunistic Expansion: Barsbay sees the crusade as cover for Mamluk ambitions. While everyone watches the Balkans, the Mamluks move—against Cyprus, against Rhodes, against Venetian holdings. Aggressive expansion masked by the greater conflict.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Mamluk Strategic Choice."

This is about whether the Mamluks successfully exploit the situation without getting drawn into conflict or facing negative consequences.\n\n\nRoll 15 — Hostile Neutrality to Ottomans\n\n\n\nSultan Barsbay receives the news of the Christian crusade with something approaching satisfaction.\n\n\nThe Ottomans have grown too bold. Murad's father Mehmed seized Thessaloniki from the Venetians. Murad himself presses ever deeper into the Balkans, his prestige rising with each conquest. In the bazaars of Cairo and Damascus, merchants speak of Ottoman power as though the Mamluks were yesterday's empire.\n\n\nLet the Christians humble them.\n\n\nBarsbay will send no soldiers to die for Ottoman glory. No Mamluk galleys will sail to defend Murad's conquests. If the crusade succeeds, the Ottomans are broken and Mamluk supremacy in the Islamic world is restored. If the crusade fails, the Ottomans will be weakened and grateful for Mamluk neutrality—or too exhausted to object when Barsbay presses his own interests.\n\n\nIn the meantime, there are opportunities. Ottoman merchant vessels in the Eastern Mediterranean. Border territories where Ottoman and Mamluk influence overlap. Perhaps even quiet contact with the Karamanids, who hate Murad as much as anyone.\n\n\nThe Sultan of Egypt will watch, and wait, and profit.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #2: Success of Mamluk Hostile Neutrality\n\n\nThis roll determines how effectively the Mamluks exploit the situation over the next 18 months—and whether their opportunism creates complications or benefits for the crusade.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nOverreach and Backlash: Mamluk opportunism becomes too obvious. Raids on Ottoman shipping, pressure on border regions—Murad is forced to notice. Despite his complacency toward Christians, insult from fellow Muslims demands response. Ottoman-Mamluk relations sour publicly, but this also reminds Murad that he has enemies everywhere. He may pay more attention to his frontiers. Complicated situation for all parties.\n16-30\nClumsy Profiteering: The Mamluks attempt to exploit Ottoman distraction but do so poorly. Their moves are transparent, their gains minimal. Murad notices but is too focused elsewhere to respond. The Mamluks gain little; the strategic situation is largely unchanged.\n31-45\nQuiet Satisfaction: Barsbay maintains dignified neutrality publicly while privately refusing all Ottoman requests for support. No dramatic moves, no obvious exploitation—just a studied indifference that speaks volumes. The Ottomans receive no help from Egypt; the crusaders face no Mamluk interference.\n46-60\nSuccessful Minor Exploitation: The Mamluks make small gains—favorable trade agreements extracted from desperate Ottoman merchants, border disputes resolved in Mamluk favor, Ottoman-allied shipping harassed by \"pirates\" with suspiciously Mamluk-looking vessels. Nothing dramatic, but profitable. No impact on crusade.\n61-75\nIntelligence Windfall: Mamluk neutrality means their merchants and diplomats move freely. They gather extensive intelligence on both sides—Ottoman weakness, crusader plans—and share none of it. Barsbay knows more about the coming war than almost anyone. This knowledge may prove valuable later.\n76-85\nKaramanid Contact: Mamluk diplomats make quiet contact with the Karamanid Beylik in Anatolia, encouraging their historic enmity with the Ottomans. If the crusade presses Murad hard, the Karamanids may stab him in the back. A potential second front opens in Anatolia—indirect Mamluk contribution to Ottoman troubles.\n86-95\nChristian Awareness: Word of Mamluk hostility toward the Ottomans reaches crusader intelligence. Juan learns that Egypt will not intervene against him—one less threat to worry about. Perhaps even an opening for future diplomacy? The crusade's strategic picture improves.\n96-100\nSecret Alignment: Barsbay goes further than mere neutrality. Through intermediaries, he signals to Christian powers that Mamluk Egypt will not oppose the crusade—and might even welcome Ottoman humiliation. Not alliance, but tacit understanding. The crusade's eastern flank is secure; the Mamluks may even share intelligence on Ottoman dispositions.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Success of Mamluk Hostile Neutrality."

This is a complicated outcome.\n\nLet me narrate this result and then move on to the Hafsid Sultanate (Tunisia).\n\n\nRoll 8 — Overreach and Backlash\n\n\n\nBarsbay's satisfaction curdles into miscalculation.\n\n\nThe Mamluk raids on Ottoman shipping begin subtly—a vessel here, a cargo there, attributed to pirates. But Mamluk governors grow bold. Border incidents multiply in Syria. Ottoman merchants in Alexandria face sudden \"tax reassessments.\" A Mamluk bey presses claims on a disputed fortress that has been quietly Ottoman-aligned for a decade.\n\n\nWord reaches Edirne. Murad may be complacent about distant Christian kings, but insult from fellow Muslims—from Mamluks who should know their place—penetrates even his hunting-focused attention.\n\n\nSharp diplomatic messages flow south. Ottoman border garrisons receive reinforcement—not against Christians, but against Egyptian opportunism. Murad's viziers argue furiously: they cannot fight two wars, but neither can they appear weak before Mamluk provocation.\n\n\nThe result is a poisoned relationship at the worst possible time. The Ottomans will receive no aid from Egypt—but they are now watching their southern flank with suspicion, diverting attention and resources. Barsbay has gained little and created an enemy who remembers.\n\n\nMamluk Status for 1441: Hostile to Ottomans, but their overreach has been noticed. No Mamluk aid to the crusade, but no Mamluk interference either. Ottoman attention is partially divided between Christian threat and Mamluk irritation.

The Hafsids control the central North African coast—modern Tunisia and eastern Algeria—and possess a capable corsair fleet. They are the closest Muslim naval power to Aragonese Sicily and Sardinia.\n\n\nWhat the Hafsids Know:\n\n\nThe King of Aragon (Alfonso V) is closely allied with this Castilian crusader king\n\nCastilian and Aragonese fleets will likely sail east for the crusade\n\nThis means the Western Mediterranean will be less defended\n\nSicily and Sardinia—Aragonese possessions—lie within Hafsid striking range\n\n\nHafsid Interests:\n\n\nProfit from corsair raiding on Christian shipping\n\nRevenge for past Christian attacks on North African ports\n\nPrestige in the Islamic world as defenders against crusader aggression\n\nAvoiding direct confrontation with united Christian naval power\n\nPossible expansion if Christian forces are committed elsewhere\n\n\nStrategic Options:\nThe Hafsids must decide: exploit Christian distraction with aggressive raiding, maintain cautious neutrality, or risk provoking retaliation by striking too boldly?\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #1: Hafsid Strategic Choice\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nCautious Neutrality: Abu Faris judges the risk too high. If the crusade succeeds, victorious Christians might turn on North Africa next. Better to stay quiet, maintain trade, and avoid drawing attention. The corsairs are leashed.\n16-30\nOpportunistic Raiding: The Sultan loosens restrictions on corsair captains. Raiding increases on Christian shipping, but without official sanction. Plausible deniability. If challenged, Tunis disclaims responsibility for \"independent pirates.\"\n31-45\nFocused Harassment: Hafsid naval forces specifically target crusade-related shipping—supply vessels, troop transports, pilgrim ships. Disrupt the crusade's logistics without attacking core Aragonese territory. Annoying but deniable.\n46-60\nDefensive Preparation: Abu Faris expects Christian retaliation regardless of what he does. He strengthens coastal defenses, gathers the fleet, prepares for war. A defensive posture that neither helps nor hinders the crusade directly.\n61-75\nSardinian Raids: The Hafsids strike at Aragonese Sardinia while Alfonso's attention is on Naples and the East. Coastal raids, captured slaves, burned villages. Not conquest, but painful harassment that may force Alfonso to divert resources.\n76-85\nSicilian Threat: Bolder than Sardinia—Hafsid corsairs probe Sicilian waters, threaten Aragonese shipping lanes to Naples. A serious strategic threat that could complicate crusade logistics significantly.\n86-95\nCoordination with Marinids: The Hafsids reach out to Morocco, proposing joint action against Christian shipping. A unified North African corsair campaign across the Western Mediterranean. If successful, a serious threat to Aragonese naval security.\n96-100\nGrand Ambition: Abu Faris sees opportunity for expansion. While Christians fight Ottomans, the Hafsids might seize Aragonese islands, establish permanent naval dominance in the Western Mediterranean.

If it succeeds, triumphant Christians will seek new conquests. If it fails, humiliated Christians will seek easier targets. Tunisia lies close, wealthy, and Muslim.\n\n\nThe Sultan issues orders. Coastal fortifications are inspected and repaired. The corsair fleet is recalled from distant waters and concentrated at Tunis, La Goulette, and Mahdia. Garrisons are reinforced. Supplies are stockpiled. Inland tribes are reminded of their obligations to defend the realm.\n\n\nThis is not aggression. Abu Faris will not poke the Christian hornet's nest while they are stirred to war. But when the storm comes—and he believes it will come—Tunisia will be ready.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #2: Success of Hafsid Defensive Preparation\n\n\nThis roll determines how effectively the Hafsids prepare their defenses over the next 18 months, and whether this posture creates any complications or benefits for the crusade.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nPreparations Backfire: The concentration of corsair fleets and defensive buildup is noticed by Christian spies. Alfonso and Juan interpret it as preparation for attack, not defense. Aragonese naval forces are kept closer to home \"just in case,\" potentially reducing ships available for the Eastern crusade. Hafsid caution ironically hinders the crusade.\n16-30\nIncomplete Preparations: Resources are limited. Some fortresses are repaired, others neglected. The fleet gathers but lacks supplies for extended operations. Abu Faris has begun preparations but will not complete them before 1441. Tunisia is marginally better defended, but gaps remain.\n31-45\nAdequate Defense: The Hafsids achieve basic defensive readiness. Coastal defenses are functional. The fleet is concentrated and supplied. Tunisia could repel a raid, though not a major invasion. No impact on the crusade—the Hafsids are focused inward.\n46-60\nSolid Preparation: Abu Faris executes his defensive strategy competently. Fortifications are strengthened, the fleet is ready, and coastal warning systems are improved. Tunisia is secure against anything short of a full crusade. Christian planners note the buildup and wisely decide to leave North Africa alone.\n61-75\nImpressive Show of Strength: Hafsid defensive preparations are visible and formidable. Christian merchants and spies report a strong, well-organized military posture. Alfonso advises Juan not to provoke Tunisia—the Western Mediterranean is stable, allowing full focus on the Eastern crusade. Inadvertent benefit to crusade planning.\n76-85\nDeterrence Achieved: The Hafsid buildup convinces Christian commanders that any North African adventure would be costly and distracting. Plans for \"securing the southern flank\" are shelved entirely. The crusade can commit fully to the East without worrying about African complications. Clear strategic benefit.\n86-95\nDiplomatic Opening: Abu Faris's defensive posture signals he wants to be left alone, not to fight. Quiet diplomatic contact establishes informal understanding: Tunisia will not raid Christian shipping; Christians will not attack Tunisia. An undeclared truce stabilizes the Western Mediterranean.\n96-100\nUnexpected Alliance Potential: Abu Faris's cautious wisdom impresses Christian diplomats. Secret discussions explore whether Hafsid neutrality might extend to positive cooperation—safe harbor for Christian ships, perhaps, or intelligence on Ottoman naval movements from Hafsid merchants. A remarkable diplomatic opportunity emerges.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Success of Hafsid Defensive Preparation."

The fortresses of Tunis, Mahdia, and Bône receive repairs—crumbling walls shored up, cisterns cleaned, ammunition stocks replenished. The corsair fleet gathers in home waters, captains grumbling at lost raiding opportunities but obeying their Sultan.\n\n\nIt is enough. Tunisia could repel a raiding expedition, defend against opportunistic attacks, weather a short blockade. Against a full Christian crusade with siege artillery and tens of thousands of men? That would be another matter—but Abu Faris judges, correctly, that no such force will come while the Christians are focused on the Ottomans.\n\n\nThe defensive preparations go unnoticed by Christian intelligence. Aragonese spies report \"routine activity\" in Tunisian ports. Alfonso V, consumed with Naples and the Eastern crusade, spares no thought for North Africa. Juan, planning the liberation of Serbia, has larger concerns than Hafsid corsairs.\n\n\nHafsid Status for 1441: Defensively postured, neither threatening nor threatened. No impact on the crusade. Tunisia watches and waits, prepared to defend but not to attack. The Western Mediterranean remains stable by mutual disinterest.\n\n\n\nMARINID SULTANATE (MOROCCO) — Strategic Assessment\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\nThe Marinid Sultanate is in severe decline. Sultan Abd al-Haqq II is young, weak, and dominated by the Wattasid viziers who hold real power. The dynasty that once threatened Iberia and ruled from Fez to Tunis now struggles to control its own territory. Berber tribes raid with impunity. The economy falters. Ceuta fell to the Portuguese in 1415 and remains a Christian dagger pointed at Moroccan territory.\n\n\nWhat the Marinids Know:\n\n\nThe Portuguese hold Ceuta and eye further expansion\n\nCastile has just completed the Reconquista—the Moors' centuries-long nightmare realized\n\nThis Castilian king now leads a great crusade eastward\n\nCastile's southern coast lies mere miles across the strait\n\nBut Castilian attention is focused far away, on Constantinople and the Ottomans\n\n\nMarinid Interests:\n\n\nSurvival of the dynasty (increasingly uncertain)\n\nRetaking Ceuta (a dream, not a realistic goal)\n\nPreventing further Christian encroachment on Moroccan territory\n\nMaintaining what little prestige remains through symbolic defense of Islam\n\nInternal stability against Wattasid ambition and tribal unrest\n\n\nStrategic Options:\nThe Marinids are weak, but weakness does not mean paralysis. They must decide whether to exploit Christian distraction, cower in fear of retaliation, or simply focus on internal survival.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #1: Marinid Strategic Choice\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-20\nInternal Collapse Focus: The Marinids are too weak to consider external action. Abd al-Haqq and the Wattasids focus entirely on internal survival—tribal revolts, court intrigue, economic crisis. Morocco effectively removes itself from Mediterranean affairs. No threat to Castile whatsoever.\n21-35\nFearful Passivity: The fall of Granada terrifies the Moroccan court. If the Christians could destroy a Muslim kingdom that endured 700 years, what chance has weakened Morocco? The Marinids avoid any action that might draw Christian attention. Absolute neutrality born of fear.\n36-50\nSymbolic Gestures: The Marinids cannot act but must appear to act. Fiery sermons against the crusaders. Diplomatic messages of solidarity to the Ottomans. Perhaps a few corsair captains encouraged to raid—unofficially. Words and gestures, no substance.\n51-65\nOpportunistic Corsair Release: The Wattasid viziers see opportunity in Christian distraction. Corsair captains are quietly unleashed to raid Castilian and Portuguese shipping. Not state policy, but not prevented either. Deniable harassment that might bring profit.\n66-80\nProbing Ceuta: The ultimate dream—retaking Ceuta while Portugal is distracted. Marinid forces probe Portuguese defenses, test their vigilance. Not a full assault, but reconnaissance for possible future action. Risky, potentially provocative.\n81-90\nCoordination Attempt: The Marinids reach out to the Hafsids and Mamluks, proposing unified Islamic response to the crusade. In their weakness, they seek strength through alliance. Whether anyone listens is another matter.\n91-100\nDesperate Gamble: The Marinids stake everything on exploiting Christian distraction. Full corsair mobilization. Raids on the Andalusian coast. Perhaps even a serious attempt on Ceuta. A dying dynasty's final throw of the dice.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Marinid Strategic Choice."

This is not official state policy but is tacitly permitted. Deniable harassment that might bring profit.\n\nNow I need to create a table for how successful this strategy is - whether the corsair raids are effective, whether they're noticed, whether they provoke retaliation, etc.\n\n\nRoll 52 — Opportunistic Corsair Release\n\n\n\nThe Wattasid viziers see what their puppet sultan cannot.\n\n\nThe Christians are distracted. The great Castilian king sails east with his knights. The Portuguese fixate on their African trading posts and dreams of Atlantic expansion. The Aragonese are consumed with Naples and Italian politics. For the first time in decades, no Christian eyes watch Morocco with hostile intent.\n\n\nQuietly, the word goes out through the ports of Salé, Tangier, and Larache. The corsair captains—hard men who have chafed under restrictions imposed after Portuguese retaliation—receive new instructions. Or rather, they receive the absence of instructions. No one tells them to raid. No one tells them not to raid. Harbor officials become conveniently blind. Customs inspectors forget to ask where captured cargo originated.\n\n\nWithin months, corsair activity in the Strait of Gibraltar increases. Fishing vessels disappear. Merchant ships sailing between Seville and the Mediterranean report suspicious sails on the horizon. A few unlucky crews find themselves in Moroccan slave markets.\n\n\nThe Wattasids maintain perfect deniability. These are independent pirates, criminals, men beyond state control. Morocco is weak, they explain to anyone who asks—how can they police every harbor, every captain, every ship? Regrettable, truly regrettable.\n\n\nThe profits, however, flow reliably to Fez.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #2: Success of Marinid Corsair Release\n\n\nThis roll determines how effective the corsair campaign is, whether it draws Christian retaliation, and what impact—if any—it has on the crusade.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nImmediate Retaliation: The corsairs grow too bold too quickly. A prominent merchant is captured, or a ship with noble passengers taken. Castilian or Portuguese warships are dispatched. Coastal raids burn Moroccan ports in reprisal. The Wattasids are forced to rein in the corsairs and pay compensation. Humiliating failure; Christian attention momentarily diverted but quickly refocused on the crusade.\n11-25\nProvocative but Contained: Corsair activity is noticed and causes anger in Seville and Lisbon. Diplomatic protests are lodged. Coastal patrols increase. However, Christian leadership decides retaliation would distract from the crusade. The corsairs are a nuisance, not a priority. Minor shipping losses; no strategic impact.\n26-40\nModest Success: The corsairs take prizes—a few merchant vessels, some valuable cargo, a handful of slaves. Profits trickle into Moroccan coffers. But the activity is too small-scale to register as a strategic concern. Christians attribute losses to \"the usual pirate activity.\" No retaliation, no impact on crusade planning.\n41-55\nProfitable Harassment: The corsair campaign exceeds expectations. Dozens of ships are taken over 18 months. Castilian merchants petition the crown for protection. Some shipping routes adjust to avoid the Strait. However, Juan and Alfonso have larger concerns—complaints are noted but action deferred until after the crusade. Morocco profits; the crusade proceeds.\n56-70\nStrategic Nuisance: Corsair activity reaches levels that genuinely concern naval planners. Ships intended for crusade logistics must patrol home waters instead. Troop transports require escorts that might otherwise support Eastern operations. A minor but measurable drain on crusade resources.\n71-85\nShipping Crisis: The corsairs achieve remarkable success. The Strait of Gibraltar becomes genuinely dangerous. Insurance rates for Mediterranean shipping soar. Several valuable cargoes destined for crusade supply are captured. Alfonso is forced to divert significant naval assets to escort duty. The crusade's logistical preparations are complicated, though not crippled.\n86-95\nMajor Disruption: Corsair activity spirals beyond Wattasid intentions. A crusade supply convoy is savaged. Reinforcements are delayed. Juan faces a choice: divert forces to punish Morocco and secure his supply lines, or proceed with reduced logistics and an insecure rear. A genuine strategic problem.\n96-100\nCatastrophic Success: The corsairs effectively close the Strait to unescorted shipping. Crusade logistics through Gibraltar become impossible without major naval commitment. The Western Mediterranean erupts into open conflict. Juan must either postpone the Eastern crusade to deal with Morocco or accept crippling supply limitations. The dying Marinid dynasty, through sheer opportunism, has created a strategic crisis.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Success of Marinid Corsair Release."

I should acknowledge this and incorporate it into the narrative for roll 64 (Strategic Nuisance).\n\nRoll 64 means the corsairs achieve enough success to genuinely concern naval planners, requiring some ships intended for the crusade to patrol home waters instead. This is a minor but measurable drain on crusade resources.\n\nHowever, with Salé destroyed, the Moroccan corsair capacity is reduced. I should adjust the narrative to reflect that they're operating from Tangier and Larache primarily, with reduced overall capacity. The roll of 64 still indicates strategic nuisance level success, but perhaps this is despite the loss of Salé, showing the remaining ports are working hard.\n\n\nRoll 64 — Strategic Nuisance\n\n\n\nYou are correct—I had forgotten. Salé lies in ruins, its harbor choked with wreckage, a monument to Castilian retaliation from earlier in your reign. The corsair nest that plagued Iberian shipping for generations was burned and broken. It has not recovered.\n\n\nThis limits Moroccan options severely. The corsairs operate now from Tangier, Larache, and smaller ports—but these lack Salé's capacity, its shipyards, its concentration of experienced raiders. What might have been a serious campaign becomes a persistent irritation.\n\n\nAnd yet, the Wattasids work with what they have.\n\n\nFrom Tangier, small squadrons slip out under cover of darkness. They know they cannot challenge Castilian warships, so they hunt carefully—isolated merchantmen, fishing fleets that stray too far from shore, coastal traders making the run between Cádiz and Málaga. Quick strikes, fast retreats, prizes towed to hidden coves before anyone can respond.\n\n\nThe losses accumulate. Merchants in Seville complain to the Consulado del Mar. Ship captains demand escorts. Insurance rates climb. Don Álvaro de Luna, managing the realm in Juan's absence, receives petitions for naval protection that he cannot fully provide—not with the fleet committed to Eastern operations.\n\n\nSome warships must remain in home waters. Patrol schedules intensify along the Andalusian coast. Vessels that might have carried supplies to Constantinople instead chase corsair sails through the Strait of Gibraltar.\n\n\nIt is not a crisis. The crusade will proceed. But it is a drain—a few ships here, a few thousand florins there, attention divided when it should be focused. The dying Marinid dynasty, operating from ruined ports with depleted resources, has nonetheless managed to make itself felt.\n\n\nMarinid Status for 1441: A strategic nuisance. Corsair activity from Tangier and Larache forces some Castilian naval assets to remain in home waters. Minor impact on crusade logistics—perhaps 5-10% of available escort capacity diverted to Strait patrol. Not crippling, but an annoyance that will persist until someone has time to deal with Morocco properly.\n\n\n\nREPUBLIC OF VENICE — Strategic Assessment\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\nDoge Francesco Foscari presides over the Most Serene Republic at the height of its commercial power. Venice dominates Eastern Mediterranean trade, maintains colonies across the Aegean, and holds Cyprus as a vassal kingdom. The Republic's relationship with the Ottomans is complex—officially hostile, practically cooperative. War disrupts trade; trade brings profit; profit is Venice's religion.\n\n\nWhat Venice Knows:\n\n\nA massive Christian crusade is forming against the Ottomans\n\nThe crusade is led by Castile, Aragon, Poland-Hungary—powers with limited Venetian ties\n\nSuccess would reshape the Eastern Mediterranean in unpredictable ways\n\nFailure would leave the Ottomans stronger and potentially vengeful toward Christians\n\nEither outcome threatens Venetian commercial interests\n\nConstantinople has already received Latin reinforcement under Castilian influence\n\n\nVenetian Interests:\n\n\nProtecting immensely profitable Ottoman trade relationships\n\nMaintaining Venetian colonies (Crete, Negroponte, various Aegean islands)\n\nPreventing any single power from dominating the Eastern Mediterranean\n\nKeeping Constantinople weak and dependent (a strong Byzantium or Castilian-controlled city threatens Venetian commercial privileges)\n\nAvoiding expensive wars that drain the treasury\n\nEnsuring that whatever happens, Venice profits\n\n\nStrategic Options:\nVenice must navigate between Christian obligation and commercial reality. Open opposition to a papal-blessed crusade is impossible. Enthusiastic support risks Ottoman retaliation and trade disruption. The Venetians will seek a middle path—but which one?\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #1: Venetian Strategic Choice\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nSecret Ottoman Alignment: Venice decides the crusade will fail and positions accordingly. Secret assurances to Murad. Intelligence on crusader movements shared through intermediaries. Commercial agreements secured for after Christian defeat. Treasonous by Christian standards, rational by Venetian calculation.\n11-25\nActive Sabotage: Without openly opposing the crusade, Venice undermines it. Supplies are delayed. Ships are unavailable. Venetian merchants spread rumors of crusader weakness. Loans are denied. A thousand small obstacles that can each be explained individually.\n26-40\nMalicious Neutrality: Venice officially supports Christendom but does nothing to help. No ships, no supplies, no loans, no intelligence. Prayers for Christian victory in San Marco, and absolutely nothing else. Let others bleed; Venice will trade with whoever wins.\n41-55\nHedging All Bets: Venice provides minimal crusade support to maintain Christian credentials while secretly assuring Ottoman merchants that trade will resume after \"this unpleasantness.\" Playing both sides with practiced skill.\n56-70\nReluctant Participation: Pressure from Rome and Christian opinion forces Venice to contribute—but minimally. A few galleys. Some supplies at high prices. Enough to avoid condemnation, little enough to avoid Ottoman anger.\n71-80\nCommercial Calculation Favors Crusade: Venetian merchants calculate that Ottoman defeat might open new opportunities—Black Sea trade, reduced competition, grateful crusader states buying Venetian goods. The Republic provides genuine if self-interested support.\n81-90\nGenuine Commitment: Doge Foscari decides Christendom must be defended. Venetian naval power commits to the crusade. Galleys, supplies, intelligence on Ottoman positions. Venice becomes a real ally—for its own reasons, but an ally nonetheless.\n91-100\nLeadership Bid: Venice sees opportunity to lead the crusade's naval component, positioning itself as Christendom's defender while ensuring Venetian interests shape the post-war Mediterranean.

The debate is long, but the conclusion is foregone. Venice has survived for a thousand years by never committing fully to anyone.\n\n\nThe public face is impeccable. Doge Foscari sends congratulatory messages to King Juan on his holy enterprise. Venetian priests offer masses for crusader victory. The Republic's ambassadors in Rome express solidarity with Pope Eugenius's call to arms. When asked directly for support, Venice demurs gracefully—the Republic is exhausted from its recent wars in Lombardy, its treasury depleted, its fleet committed to defending its own colonies against the very Turks the crusade will fight. Surely Christendom understands.\n\n\nThe private face is rather different.\n\n\nThrough intermediaries in Constantinople and Adrianople, Venetian merchants convey quiet assurances to their Ottoman trading partners. This crusade is a Spanish affair, a Polish adventure. Venice has no quarrel with the Sultan. When the unpleasantness concludes—however it concludes—Venetian ships will return to Ottoman ports. Business will resume. The fondaco warehouses will reopen. Profits will flow.\n\n\nSecret instructions go to Venetian governors in Crete, Negroponte, and the Aegean colonies: cooperate with crusaders if directly asked, but volunteer nothing. No Venetian harbor should become a crusader base unless absolutely unavoidable. No Venetian ship should carry crusader supplies unless well paid. And keep meticulous records of everything—whoever wins will want to know who helped whom.\n\n\nThe Republic places its bet on the only outcome it truly believes in: Venetian survival.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #2: Success of Venetian Hedging\n\n\nThis roll determines how effectively Venice maintains its double game over the next 18 months—and whether either side discovers the extent of Venetian duplicity.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nExposed: Venetian double-dealing is discovered—perhaps a letter intercepted, a merchant who talks too much, an ambassador who drinks too freely. The crusade leadership learns Venice is assuring the Ottomans of continued friendship. Public scandal. Papal condemnation. Venice is frozen out of crusade planning and branded as treacherous. Christian unity strengthened by common anger at Venetian perfidy.\n11-25\nOttoman Suspicion: Despite assurances, the Ottomans don't trust Venice. Murad's advisors note Venetian ships in crusader waters, Venetian merchants in crusader ports. Trade restrictions are quietly imposed. Venice's careful neutrality pleases no one and costs them Ottoman goodwill without gaining Christian trust.\n26-40\nChristian Suspicion: Crusade leadership notices Venetian absence from meaningful support. Juan and Alfonso exchange pointed observations about Venetian priorities. No public accusation, but Venice is excluded from strategic planning. The Republic's post-war influence will be limited by its wartime absence.\n41-55\nSuccessful Hedging: Venice threads the needle. Christians accept excuses about exhaustion and prior commitments. Ottomans accept assurances of resumed trade. Neither side fully trusts Venice, but neither moves against it. The Republic maintains its position without cost or benefit to either side.\n56-70\nProfitable Neutrality: Venice's position allows it to trade with both sides—supplies sold to crusaders at premium prices, continued commerce with Ottoman merchants through neutral intermediaries. War is profitable when you sell to everyone. The Republic emerges wealthier regardless of outcome.\n71-85\nIntelligence Windfall: Venice's dual position provides extraordinary intelligence access. Venetian merchants hear Ottoman military gossip; Venetian bankers learn crusader financial arrangements. The Republic knows more about both sides than either knows about itself. This information is hoarded, not shared—but could prove valuable.\n86-95\nLate Repositioning: As the crusade develops, Venetian calculations shift. If one side appears likely to win, Venice will smoothly pivot to support them—arriving late but claiming credit. The Republic positions itself to join the winning side at the optimal moment.\n96-100\nMasterful Manipulation: Venice plays both sides to perfection, actually influencing events to create a prolonged, indecisive conflict that exhausts both Christians and Ottomans—leaving Venice as the dominant Mediterranean power by default. The Republic's cynical strategy achieves results beyond mere survival.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Success of Venetian Hedging."

In Kraków, a Venetian banker extends credit to Polish nobles preparing for war and listens carefully to their boasts about troop numbers. In Naples, Venetian factors note every ship that loads crusader supplies, every knight who embarks, every florin that changes hands.\n\n\nThe information flows back to Venice through coded letters, trusted captains, and the ancient network of commercial contacts that spans every port from Lisbon to Trebizond. The Council of Ten assembles a picture of the coming war that neither side possesses in full.\n\n\nThey know Juan's approximate troop commitments. They know Polish-Hungarian muster expectations—and the realistic shortfalls Újlaki confided. They know Ottoman complacency and which frontier commanders are preparing despite the Sultan's disinterest. They know Mamluk hostility toward the Ottomans and Hafsid defensive preparations. They know the Marinid corsairs are increasing activity in the Strait.\n\n\nThis intelligence is shared with no one. It sits in locked cabinets in the Ducal Palace, awaiting the moment when it becomes valuable—perhaps to sell to the likely victor, perhaps to inform a late Venetian intervention, perhaps simply to ensure the Republic is never surprised by events.\n\n\nVenice watches. Venice waits. Venice knows.\n\n\nVenetian Status for 1441: Successfully hedging, trusted by neither side but suspected by neither of outright treachery. Possesses significant intelligence on both crusader and Ottoman preparations. No material contribution to the crusade; no active opposition. Will likely attempt to profit from the outcome regardless of who wins. A wild card that could become relevant if the war's trajectory becomes clear.\n\n\n\nREPUBLIC OF GENOA — Strategic Assessment\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\nGenoa is Venice's eternal rival, but a rival in decline. The Republic has lost its Black Sea colonies to Ottoman pressure, though it still holds Galata—the trading quarter across the Golden Horn from Constantinople—and various Aegean possessions including Chios and Lesbos. Genoese bankers remain influential throughout Europe, and Genoese ships carry much of the Mediterranean's trade.\n\n\nWhat Genoa Knows:\n\n\nCastile has used Genoese ships extensively—Juan contracted Genoese transports for his Constantinople expedition\n\nThe crusade represents both opportunity and danger for Genoese interests\n\nGalata's position is precarious—tolerated by the Ottomans, dependent on not offending the Sultan\n\nA successful crusade might restore Genoese Black Sea trade; a failed one might cost them Galata entirely\n\nVenice is their rival; whatever Venice does, Genoa instinctively considers the opposite\n\n\nGenoese Interests:\n\n\nProtecting Galata and remaining Aegean colonies\n\nRestoring Black Sea trade access lost to Ottoman expansion\n\nCompeting with Venice for commercial advantage\n\nProfit from shipping contracts, banking, and trade\n\nAvoiding the costs of war while reaping the benefits of whoever wins\n\n\nStrategic Options:\nGenoa must balance commercial caution against the opportunity a crusade presents—and the instinctive desire to position itself opposite Venice.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #1: Genoese Strategic Choice\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nProtect Galata Above All: Genoa's priority is keeping Galata. This means avoiding anything that might anger the Ottomans. Minimal crusade involvement, quiet assurances to the Sultan, desperate hope that the storm passes without destroying their most valuable possession.\n16-30\nCautious Commercial Neutrality: Like Venice, Genoa hedges—but with less sophistication. Ships available for hire to anyone who pays. Banking services for all parties. No political commitment. Pure commerce, hoping profit outweighs risk.\n31-45\nOpportunistic Support: Genoa provides crusade support primarily to secure future commercial advantage. Ships and loans offered with strings attached—trade privileges in reconquered territories, preferred access to Constantinople's markets, guaranteed contracts. Self-interested assistance.\n46-60\nCounter-Venetian Positioning: Whatever Venice does, Genoa does the opposite. If Venice hedges, Genoa commits. The crusade becomes a vehicle for Genoese commercial advantage over their hated rival. Support motivated by rivalry as much as faith or profit.\n61-75\nBanking Opportunity: Genoese bankers see the crusade as a massive lending opportunity. Loans to crusader states, to nobles equipping themselves, to kings financing armies. War is expensive; financing war is profitable. Genoa commits financially if not militarily.\n76-85\nGenuine Strategic Commitment: Genoese leadership calculates that Ottoman defeat would restore their Black Sea empire. The prize is worth the risk. Genoa commits ships, money, and political support to the crusade with genuine strategic intent.\n86-95\nAlliance with Castile: Juan has worked with Genoese ships before. Genoa formalizes this relationship, becoming Castile's primary naval and financial partner in the Eastern Mediterranean. A strategic alignment that reshapes Genoese foreign policy.\n96-100\nAll-In Gamble: Genoa stakes its future on crusade victory. Massive naval commitment, extensive loans, diplomatic pressure on wavering states. If the crusade succeeds, Genoa becomes the dominant Christian commercial power in the East. If it fails, Genoa may fall with it.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Genoese Strategic Choice."

Genoa commits ships, money, and political support to the crusade with genuine strategic intent.\n\nThis is a positive outcome for Juan - Genoa is committing genuinely to the crusade. Now I need to create a follow-up roll to see how successful this commitment is in practice.\n\n\nRoll 84 — Genuine Strategic Commitment\n\n\n\nIn the halls of the Palazzo San Giorgio, the Bank of Saint George's governors calculate futures in cold arithmetic.\n\n\nThe Black Sea was once a Genoese lake. Caffa, Tana, Trebizond—colonies that funneled the wealth of the East through Genoese hands. Silk and spices, slaves and grain, furs from the Russian steppes and gems from Persia. For two centuries, these riches built Genoese power.\n\n\nThen came the Ottomans. The Black Sea trade has withered. Caffa survives, barely, as a shadow of its former glory. The straits are controlled by Turkish fortresses. Every Genoese ship that passes Constantinople does so at the Sultan's sufferance. Galata—their precious foothold across from the Byzantine capital—exists because the Ottomans find it useful, not because Genoa can defend it.\n\n\nBut now... now a genuine crusade forms. Not the usual papal rhetoric, but a king who has actually destroyed a Muslim kingdom. Ships. Soldiers. Polish and Hungarian cavalry. A two-front war that might—might—break Ottoman power in Europe.\n\n\nIf the Ottomans fall, the Black Sea reopens. Caffa flourishes again. The old trade routes flow with Genoese cargo. Constantinople itself might grant new privileges to those who helped liberate it. The potential profits dwarf any short-term risk.\n\n\nThe decision is made. Genoa will commit.\n\n\nDoge Tommaso di Campofregoso issues instructions. Genoese shipyards accelerate construction. The Republic's war galleys are refitted and crewed. Banking houses are authorized to extend generous credit to crusade participants. Diplomatic missions carry offers of alliance to Castile, to the Pope, to anyone organizing the great enterprise.\n\n\nThis is not hedging. This is not token support. Genoa is gambling its future on Christian victory.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #2: Success of Genoese Strategic Commitment\n\n\nThis roll determines how effectively Genoa executes its commitment over the next 18 months—the quality of support provided, whether it reaches the crusade effectively, and what complications arise.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nOverextension and Collapse: Genoa commits more than it can sustain. Ships are promised but not delivered. Loans are extended but funds run short. Internal political opposition to the costly commitment grows. By 1441, Genoese support has become unreliable—promises half-kept, resources stretched thin. The crusade cannot depend on Genoa despite initial enthusiasm.\n11-25\nVenetian Interference: Venice cannot allow Genoa to gain advantage through crusade support. Venetian agents disrupt Genoese shipping, spread rumors about Genoese reliability, outbid Genoese bankers for key contracts. The commitment is genuine but constantly undermined by rival sabotage. Reduced effectiveness.\n26-40\nGalata Complications: Ottoman pressure on Galata increases as Genoese crusade support becomes known. The colony's governor sends desperate messages—every ship committed to the crusade is a ship not defending Genoese possessions. Genoa must balance crusade commitment against protecting existing assets. Support is real but divided.\n41-55\nSolid but Limited: Genoa delivers on its commitments competently. Ships arrive as promised. Loans are honored. But the Republic's resources are finite—this is meaningful support, not overwhelming force. A reliable junior partner to the crusade, not a decisive factor.\n56-70\nEffective Contribution: Genoese ships prove valuable for logistics and naval screening. Genoese bankers smooth financial complications. Genoese intelligence on Ottoman naval dispositions—gathered from Galata merchants—proves useful. A genuinely helpful ally whose contribution exceeds expectations.\n71-85\nStrategic Partnership: Genoa and Castile develop effective coordination. Genoese admirals integrate well with crusader naval planning. Banking arrangements facilitate troop movements and supply purchases. The alliance becomes a model of cooperation. Juan gains a reliable maritime partner for Eastern operations.\n86-95\nExceptional Commitment: Genoa exceeds its promises. Additional ships are found. Credit is extended on favorable terms. Genoese captains volunteer for dangerous missions. The Republic's genuine belief in crusade victory translates into exceptional effort. A major asset to the campaign.\n96-100\nTransformation of the Eastern Mediterranean: Genoese commitment catalyzes broader change. Other Italian states, seeing Genoa's bold move, reconsider their own positions. Genoese networks provide intelligence, logistics, and financial infrastructure that multiplies crusade effectiveness. The Republic positions itself as the indispensable partner for Christian operations in the East—and begins planning for a restored Black Sea empire before the first battle is even fought.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Success of Genoese Strategic Commitment."

This falls in the 11-25 range: Venetian Interference.\n\nSo Genoa genuinely commits to the crusade, but Venice - seeing their rival positioning itself to gain advantage - actively undermines Genoese efforts. This is a classic Venetian-Genoese rivalry situation. The commitment is real but constantly sabotaged.\n\nLet me write this up and then move to the next faction: Wallachia (Vlad II Dracul).\n\n\nRoll 18 — Venetian Interference\n\n\n\nVenice notices immediately.\n\n\nThe Council of Ten receives reports within weeks of Genoa's decision. Genoese shipyards working at capacity. Genoese bankers offering favorable terms to crusade participants. Genoese diplomats in Rome, in Naples, in Barcelona, trumpeting their Republic's commitment to holy war.\n\n\nThe implications are intolerable. If the crusade succeeds with Genoese help, Genoa will claim the rewards. Black Sea trade restored—under Genoese control. Constantinople's gratitude—expressed in Genoese commercial privileges. A generation of Venetian dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean—undone by a rival who bet correctly while Venice hedged.\n\n\nThis cannot be permitted.\n\n\nThe Venetian response is subtle, deniable, and ruthless. Genoese ships find themselves delayed in ports where Venetian influence runs deep. Rumors spread through banking houses that Genoese credit is overextended, that the Republic cannot honor its commitments. Venetian merchants outbid Genoese factors for key supply contracts, then mysteriously fail to deliver. A Genoese galley suffers a suspicious fire in a Cretan harbor. Another is detained for \"customs irregularities\" in Negroponte.\n\n\nNothing can be proven. Every incident has an innocent explanation. But the pattern is unmistakable to those who know how Venice operates.\n\n\nGenoese commanders arrive at rendezvous points to find supplies diverted. Loans promised to crusader nobles are suddenly matched by Venetian offers at better rates—not because Venice wants to help the crusade, but because Venice wants Genoa to fail. The Bank of Saint George finds its letters of credit questioned in markets where Venetian bankers whisper doubts.\n\n\nGenoa's commitment remains genuine. But execution becomes a constant struggle against invisible opposition. Ships that should carry crusade supplies instead chase Venetian provocations. Energy that should focus on Ottoman defeat is wasted on Italian rivalry.\n\n\nGenoese Status for 1441: Genuinely committed to the crusade but significantly undermined by Venetian interference. Support will be real but reduced—perhaps 60-70% of what Genoa intended to provide. Reliable where it arrives, but constantly disrupted. A frustrating ally whose enthusiasm exceeds its effective delivery. The ancient rivalry between the maritime republics continues to poison Christian cooperation.\n\n\n\nPRINCIPALITY OF WALLACHIA — Strategic Assessment\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\nVlad II, known as Vlad Dracul (\"the Dragon\") for his membership in the Order of the Dragon, rules Wallachia as an Ottoman vassal. His position is precarious—he holds power only because the Sultan permits it, having been installed by Ottoman support after years of exile. His sons Mircea, Vlad (the future \"Dracula\"), and Radu are hostages at the Ottoman court, guarantees of their father's loyalty.\n\n\nWhat Vlad Dracul Knows:\n\n\nA great crusade is forming against his Ottoman overlords\n\nHungary—Wallachia's other powerful neighbor—is joining the crusade\n\nIf the crusade succeeds, Wallachia might be liberated from Ottoman vassalage\n\nIf the crusade fails, any Wallachian support for it means death—for him and his hostage sons\n\nHe is a member of the Order of the Dragon, sworn to defend Christendom against the Turks\n\nHis oath to the Dragon conflicts absolutely with his submission to the Sultan\n\n\nWallachian Interests:\n\n\nSurvival of Vlad Dracul and his dynasty\n\nSurvival of his sons held hostage in Ottoman territory\n\nIndependence from Ottoman vassalage (desired but dangerous to pursue)\n\nMaintaining relations with Hungary as a counterweight\n\nAvoiding being crushed between the two great powers\n\n\nStrategic Options:\nVlad Dracul faces an impossible choice. His Christian oaths demand he support the crusade. His Ottoman vassalage—and his sons' lives—demand he oppose it. Whatever he chooses, he risks everything.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #1: Wallachian Strategic Choice\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nLoyal Ottoman Vassal: Vlad Dracul cannot risk his sons' lives. He commits fully to Ottoman service, providing troops and supplies for the Sultan's defense. Wallachia fights against the crusade. A Christian prince turned infidel ally—tragic but understandable given the hostages.\n16-30\nReluctant Ottoman Support: Vlad provides minimum required support to the Ottomans—token troops, nominal compliance. He drags his feet, delays, finds excuses. Not outright betrayal of the Sultan, but far less than enthusiastic service. His sons' safety requires some obedience; his conscience prevents more.\n31-45\nDesperate Neutrality: Vlad attempts the impossible—true neutrality. He provides nothing to either side, claims his small principality has nothing to offer, begs both powers to leave Wallachia alone. A doomed strategy, but one that postpones the terrible choice.\n46-60\nSecret Crusade Sympathy: Publicly, Vlad remains the loyal vassal. Privately, he establishes secret contact with Hungarian commanders, passes information about Ottoman movements, and prepares to switch sides if the crusade appears victorious. Double game with his sons' lives at stake.\n61-75\nDelayed Commitment: Vlad waits to see which side is winning. If the crusade achieves early victories, he will declare for Christendom and attempt to rescue his sons. If the Ottomans hold firm, he remains their vassal. Opportunism born of desperation.\n76-85\nBold Defection: Vlad Dracul decides the crusade offers his best chance at freedom. He secretly coordinates with Hungarian forces, prepares to revolt against Ottoman overlordship, and accepts that his hostage sons may die for Wallachian liberation. A terrible sacrifice, but one he judges necessary.\n86-95\nRescue and Revolt: Vlad attempts to have his sons rescued or ransomed before openly declaring for the crusade. Agents are dispatched to Ottoman territory. If the boys can be saved, Wallachia rises against the Sultan. If not... the choice becomes even more agonizing.\n96-100\nCatalyst of Rebellion: Vlad Dracul becomes a symbol of Christian resistance. His defection inspires other Balkan vassals to reconsider their loyalties. Serbian nobles, Bulgarian boyars, Albanian chiefs—all watch what happens to Wallachia. If Vlad succeeds, the Ottoman Balkans might erupt in general revolt.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Wallachian Strategic Choice."

He drags his feet, delays, finds excuses. Not outright betrayal of the Sultan, but far less than enthusiastic service. His sons' safety requires some obedience; his conscience prevents more.\n\nNow I need to draft a table to see how successful this strategy is - how well Vlad manages to provide minimal support while keeping his sons safe and not angering the Sultan too much.\n\n\nRoll 26 — Reluctant Ottoman Support\n\n\n\nVlad Dracul paces the halls of Târgoviște, the weight of impossible choices pressing upon him.\n\n\nHe wears the Dragon's cross beneath his robes—the symbol of his oath to defend Christendom. He remembers the ceremony in Nuremberg, Emperor Sigismund's hand on his shoulder, the sacred vow to fight the enemies of Christ until death. That oath burns in his soul.\n\n\nBut in Adrianople, his sons sleep in Ottoman custody. Young Vlad, barely thirteen, dark-eyed and fierce. Little Radu, only ten, too beautiful for his own safety in the Sultan's court. Every night, Vlad Dracul imagines the bowstring around their throats, the quiet execution that would follow any Wallachian betrayal.\n\n\nHe cannot openly defy the Sultan. He cannot.\n\n\nBut neither can he fight with full heart against fellow Christians, against the crusade that might—might—free his principality from Turkish vassalage. His Dragon oath forbids it. His conscience forbids it.\n\n\nSo Vlad Dracul chooses the coward's path, the survivor's path, the father's path.\n\n\nWhen Ottoman messengers demand Wallachian troops for the coming war, Vlad complies—minimally. He sends levy soldiers, not his best men. Poorly equipped peasants who will serve as laborers and camp followers, not the viteji cavalry that forms Wallachia's true military strength. He cites poverty, plague, Hungarian raids on his northern border. So sorry, so very sorry, but Wallachia has little to offer the mighty Sultan.\n\n\nHe delays. He obfuscates. He sends gifts and flowery letters full of protestations of loyalty while providing as little actual support as possible.\n\n\nIt is a dangerous game. The Ottomans are not fools.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #2: Success of Reluctant Ottoman Support\n\n\nThis roll determines whether Vlad Dracul successfully threads the needle—providing enough to avoid Ottoman punishment while withholding enough to salve his conscience—and what complications arise from his dangerous balancing act.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nOttoman Suspicion Confirmed: Vlad's foot-dragging is noticed and reported. The Sultan's agents investigate. Evidence of Vlad's minimal compliance—or worse, secret Hungarian contacts—reaches Adrianople. The hostage sons face increased danger. Vlad may be summoned to explain himself, or replaced with a more reliable vassal. His position becomes critical.\n11-20\nPunishment Through Sons: The Ottomans cannot prove betrayal, but Vlad's reluctance is obvious. As warning, his sons' conditions worsen—harsher confinement, reduced privileges, perhaps a beating for young Vlad who has his father's defiant spirit. A message: we know, and we can hurt you.\n21-35\nIncreased Demands: Ottoman officials, sensing Vlad's reluctance, demand more rather than accepting less. Additional tribute. More troops. Personal attendance at the Sultan's court. Each demand forces Vlad to choose between deeper collaboration or open defiance. The pressure mounts.\n36-50\nPrecarious Balance: Vlad's minimal compliance is accepted, barely. Ottoman officials grumble but have larger concerns than one reluctant vassal. His sons remain hostages in unchanged conditions. Wallachia provides token support—enough to avoid punishment, little enough to limit Christian bloodshed. An unsatisfying but survivable position.\n51-65\nSuccessful Deception: Vlad's excuses are believed. Plague? Yes, travelers confirm sickness in Wallachia. Hungarian raids? The border is indeed troubled. The Ottomans accept reduced Wallachian contribution as genuine incapacity rather than disloyalty. Vlad buys time and preserves his options.\n66-75\nHungarian Contact: While maintaining his Ottoman facade, Vlad establishes secret communication with Hungarian commanders. Nothing treasonous—merely \"keeping channels open.\" But if the crusade succeeds, Wallachia will not be caught on the wrong side. A hedge against the future.\n76-85\nQuiet Admiration: Other Balkan vassals notice Vlad's minimal compliance and take note. The Serbian despotate, Bulgarian boyars—all watch to see if resistance is possible. Vlad becomes a quiet symbol of Christian persistence under Ottoman rule, even if he cannot act openly.\n86-95\nInformation Channel: Vlad's position allows him to observe Ottoman preparations without suspicion. Through trusted agents, information about Ottoman troop movements, supply depots, and defensive plans reaches Hungarian ears. Vlad serves the crusade without openly betraying his overlord—a secret contribution that might prove valuable.\n96-100\nFoundation for Revolt: Vlad's careful resistance builds a network. Loyal boyars who share his hidden sympathies. Contacts with Hungarian frontier lords. Cached weapons and supplies for the day when open revolt becomes possible. When the crusade strikes, Wallachia will be ready to rise—if the moment is right.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Success of Reluctant Ottoman Support."

Despite Vlad Dracul's outwardly cautious strategy of minimal Ottoman compliance, behind the scenes he has been building something much more substantial - a network of resistance, contacts with Hungarian commanders, cached supplies, and loyal boyars who share his hidden sympathies for Christendom.\n\nThis means that when the crusade actually strikes in 1441, Wallachia won't just be a reluctant Ottoman vassal dragging its feet - it will be positioned to potentially revolt and join the Christian side at a critical moment. This could be a major strategic asset for the crusade, as Wallachia sits on the Ottoman flank and could disrupt Ottoman logistics, provide intelligence, or even open a third front.\n\nThe player is asking what this means, so I should explain the narrative implications and strategic significance of this roll.\n\n\nRoll 96 — Foundation for Revolt\n\n\n\nThis is extraordinary. Let me explain what has happened:\n\n\nVlad Dracul chose the cautious path—reluctant Ottoman support, minimal compliance, survival at any cost. But the execution of that cautious strategy has exceeded all expectations.\n\n\nWhat began as mere foot-dragging has evolved into something far more dangerous to Ottoman interests.\n\n\n\nThe Network Forms\n\n\nIn the long winter nights at Târgoviște, Vlad Dracul receives visitors. Loyal boyars who remember Wallachian independence. Orthodox priests who whisper of Christian deliverance. Merchants who travel freely between Hungarian and Ottoman lands, carrying more than goods.\n\n\nVlad tells himself he is merely \"keeping options open.\" But options require preparation.\n\n\nTrusted viteji commanders are quietly sounded out. Which officers would follow their prince against the Sultan, if the moment came? The answers are carefully remembered, never written down. Weapons are cached in monasteries—the Ottomans rarely search holy ground thoroughly. Supplies are stockpiled against \"Hungarian raids\" that never quite materialize.\n\n\nThrough Serbian merchants, contact is established with Hungarian frontier lords. Nothing treasonous—merely \"commercial arrangements.\" But the merchants carry messages, and the messages carry information. Ottoman garrison strengths. Patrol schedules along the Danube. The names of Turkish commanders and their habits.\n\n\nThe information flows north to Hungary. And Hungarian responses flow south: Hold fast. The hour approaches. When the crusade strikes, Wallachia will not be forgotten.\n\n\nVlad Dracul still provides token troops to the Sultan. He still writes flowery letters of loyalty. He still plays the reluctant but obedient vassal.\n\n\nBut beneath that mask, Wallachia prepares.\n\n\n\nStrategic Implications for the Crusade\n\n\nThis result transforms Wallachia from a minor complication into a potential strategic asset:\n\n\nIntelligence Pipeline: Hungarian commanders will enter the 1441 campaign with detailed knowledge of Ottoman positions, strengths, and weaknesses in the Danubian sector—courtesy of Vlad's network.\n\nPotential Third Front: If the crusade achieves early success, Wallachia is positioned to revolt and open a third front against the Ottomans. This would stretch Turkish forces and threaten their lines of communication.\n\nBalkan Catalyst: Other Balkan vassals are watching Vlad. Serbian nobles, Bulgarian boyars—all nursing their own grievances. A successful Wallachian revolt could trigger a cascade of uprisings across Ottoman Europe.\n\nDanube Flank: Wallachia controls critical Danube crossings. If Vlad turns, Ottoman reinforcements from Anatolia face a hostile shore.\n\nThe Hostage Problem Remains: Vlad's sons are still in Ottoman hands. He will not move openly until he believes his boys can be saved—or until he accepts their sacrifice. The crusade's success may determine whether Vlad acts.\n\n\nWallachian Status for 1441: Officially a reluctant Ottoman vassal providing minimal support. Secretly, a Christian resistance network poised for revolt at the critical moment. A dagger hidden at the Sultan's back—if the crusade provides the opportunity to strike.\n\n\n\nShall we proceed to Serbia?"

Let me set up the strategic assessment for Serbia under Despot Đurađ Branković.\n\nSerbia is actually the primary target of the crusade - they plan to liberate it. So the question is how Serbia's ruler will respond to the coming crusade. This is a critical faction.\n\n\nSERBIAN DESPOTATE — Strategic Assessment\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\nDespot Đurađ Branković rules what remains of medieval Serbia—a truncated state squeezed between Ottoman power and Hungarian ambition. His capital Smederevo, a massive fortress on the Danube, represents the last great bastion of Serbian independence. But \"independence\" is a generous term; Serbia pays tribute to the Sultan, provides troops when demanded, and survives only because the Ottomans find a buffer state temporarily useful.\n\n\nĐurađ is old now, nearly seventy, a survivor who has navigated impossible politics for decades. He has married daughters to Ottoman sultans and Hungarian kings alike. His son-in-law is Sultan Murad II himself. His other daughter married the late Hungarian king. He has played both sides for so long that neither fully trusts him—but neither has destroyed him either.\n\n\nWhat Đurađ Knows:\n\n\nThe crusade specifically aims to \"liberate Serbia\"—his lands are the primary objective\n\nSuccess means freedom from Ottoman vassalage, but also potential Hungarian domination\n\nFailure means Ottoman retribution against the Serbian state and the Branković dynasty\n\nHis family ties to Murad II might be worthless if the Sultan feels betrayed\n\nHis family ties to Hungary might be worthless if the crusade fails\n\nAt nearly seventy, this may be his last chance to see Serbia free—or his last mistake\n\n\nSerbian Interests:\n\n\nSurvival of the Branković dynasty\n\nSurvival of the Serbian Orthodox Church and people\n\nIndependence from both Ottoman and Hungarian domination\n\nPreservation of Smederevo and remaining Serbian territory\n\nAvoiding becoming a battlefield where Serbs die for others' ambitions\n\n\nThe Cruel Dilemma:\nSerbia is not choosing whether to support the crusade—Serbia is the prize. The war will be fought on Serbian soil regardless of what Đurađ wants. His only choice is how to position himself: as Ottoman loyalist, crusader ally, or desperate neutral trying to survive the storm.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #1: Serbian Strategic Choice\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nOttoman Loyalty: Đurađ decides the crusade will fail, as crusades always do. He commits fully to the Sultan—his son-in-law, after all. Serbian troops will defend against the Christian invasion. Smederevo's walls will hold for the Ottomans. Better a living vassal than a dead rebel.\n11-20\nResigned Submission: Đurađ lacks the strength to resist either power. He will submit to whoever stands before Smederevo's gates. If the Ottomans demand troops, he provides them. If the crusaders demand surrender, he yields. Serbia bends with the wind and prays to survive.\n21-35\nAgonized Neutrality: Đurađ attempts to commit to neither side. He delays Ottoman troop demands with excuses. He sends no messages to the crusaders. He strengthens Smederevo and waits, hoping the war somehow passes him by. A futile hope, but an old man's hope.\n36-50\nSecret Crusade Sympathy: Publicly, Đurađ remains the Sultan's loyal vassal. Privately, he establishes contact with Hungarian commanders, offers intelligence, and prepares to welcome \"liberators\" if they reach Smederevo. He will declare for whoever is winning when the outcome becomes clear.\n51-65\nConditional Crusade Support: Đurađ reaches out to the crusade leadership through intermediaries. He will support Christian forces—but he demands guarantees. Serbian independence, not Hungarian annexation. Orthodox Church rights protected. The Branković dynasty confirmed. No blank check.\n66-80\nActive Collaboration: Đurađ commits to the crusade despite the risks. Serbian intelligence flows to Hungarian commanders. Serbian guides will lead crusader forces through the terrain. When battle comes, Serbian troops will turn on their Ottoman \"allies.\" A decisive choice.\n81-90\nRally of the Serbs: Đurađ transforms from survivor to leader. He calls upon Serbian pride, Serbian faith, Serbian memory of the Kosovo martyrs. The despotate mobilizes not as a reluctant ally but as a nation fighting for its freedom. Serbian enthusiasm becomes a crusade asset.\n91-100\nSerbian National Rising: Đurađ's commitment ignites something larger. Serbian communities under direct Ottoman rule—in Kosovo, in Macedonia—hear that the Despot has declared for Christendom. Partisan resistance spreads. The crusade gains not just an ally but a popular uprising across Serbian lands.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Serbian Strategic Choice."

This is extraordinary, especially combined with the Wallachian roll of 96. The Balkans are preparing for a major uprising against Ottoman rule.\n\nLet me think about what this means and draft an appropriate outcome table.\n\nĐurađ Branković, at nearly seventy years old, has decided to stake everything on the crusade. Not just passive support or secret collaboration, but an active attempt to rally the Serbian nation. This will spread beyond just the despotate - into Kosovo, Macedonia, areas under direct Ottoman control.\n\nThis is historically significant. The memory of Kosovo 1389 is still fresh - only 50 years ago. Serbian identity is strongly tied to Orthodox Christianity and resistance to Ottoman rule. If Đurađ calls for a rising, there will be many who answer.\n\nBut there are risks:\n- Ottoman retaliation could be swift and brutal\n- Not all Serbs will rise - some have accommodated to Ottoman rule\n- The timing needs to coordinate with crusade operations\n- If the crusade fails, Serbian resistance will be crushed\n\nThe success roll should determine:\n- How widespread the rising becomes\n- How effectively it's coordinated with the crusade\n- Whether it's discovered prematurely\n- How the Ottomans respond\n- What military contribution it provides\n\nGiven the 99 roll on strategy, the table should start from a baseline of \"this is a bold, ambitious choice\" - but execution can still vary widely.\n\n\nRoll 99 — Serbian National Rising\n\n\n\nSomething breaks in Đurađ Branković.\n\n\nPerhaps it is the letter from Kraków, smuggled through Hungarian intermediaries, describing the crusade forming against the Sultan. Perhaps it is the news of Wallachian preparations, whispered by Orthodox monks who travel freely between the principalities. Perhaps it is simply the weight of seventy years, the knowledge that he will not see another chance, that Serbia will not see another chance.\n\n\nOr perhaps it is the memory of Kosovo.\n\n\nFifty years ago, on the Field of Blackbirds, the flower of Serbian knighthood died fighting the Ottoman tide. Prince Lazar fell. The kingdom fell. Everything that came after—the vassalage, the tribute, the daughters married to Turkish sultans—has been survival, not life. The Serbian people have endured, but they have not lived.\n\n\nĐurađ summons his council in secret. His sons, his loyal boyars, the bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church. He speaks words that cannot be unspoken.\n\n\n\"The hour of deliverance approaches. Christian kings ride against the Sultan—not with words and promises, but with armies. Castile, Poland, Hungary, the Pope himself. For the first time since Kosovo, we have a chance. Not merely to survive, but to be free.\"\n\n\nThe old Despot's voice grows stronger.\n\n\n\"I will not go to my grave as a Turkish dog. I will not leave my sons a kingdom of slaves. When the crusade strikes, Serbia rises. Pass the word—quietly, carefully, but pass it. To every village, every monastery, every Serbian heart from Smederevo to Kosovo. The Lion of Serbia wakes.\"\n\n\n\nThe Word Spreads\n\n\nThrough the networks of the Orthodox Church—monks who travel freely, priests who hear confessions, bishops who correspond across invisible borders—the message flows outward.\n\n\nIn the Despotate, Đurađ's decision is implemented directly. Weapons are stockpiled. Fighting men are identified and quietly organized. The great fortress of Smederevo is provisioned for siege—but the Despot's men know they will not be defending it against Christians.\n\n\nBeyond the Despotate's borders, the message becomes something more: a spark touching dry tinder.\n\n\nIn Kosovo, where Serbian memory burns hottest, old men speak of their fathers who died at the Field of Blackbirds. Young men listen. Ottoman tax collectors begin to notice hostile stares, delayed payments, villages that seem emptier than they should be.\n\n\nIn Macedonia, Serbian communities that have lived under direct Ottoman rule for decades hear whispers of the Despot's call. Not all respond—many have accommodated, intermarried, made their peace. But some remember. Some prepare.\n\n\nIn the mountains, hajduks—the bandits and outlaws who have always resisted Ottoman rule—receive visitors from Smederevo. Their raiding, always a nuisance to the Turks, takes on new purpose. Coordination. Targets. Timing.\n\n\nThe Serbian Church becomes the nervous system of resistance. Monasteries become weapons caches. Confession becomes intelligence gathering. The liturgy's prayers for \"deliverance from the infidel\" take on immediate, dangerous meaning.\n\n\n\nStrategic Implications\n\n\nThis result fundamentally transforms the crusade's strategic picture:\n\n\nPopular Uprising: The crusade will not merely liberate Serbia—it will be welcomed by an organized resistance. Serbian guides, Serbian intelligence, Serbian partisans harassing Ottoman supply lines.\n\nKosovo Dimension: Serbian communities in Kosovo itself are preparing to rise. If the crusade advances that far, the heartland of Serbian memory could erupt behind Ottoman lines.\n\nOrthodox Network: The Serbian Church's involvement creates links to other Orthodox populations under Ottoman rule—Bulgarians, Greeks, Albanians. The rising could spread beyond Serbian lands.\n\nOttoman Blind Spot: The Ottomans have grown accustomed to Serbian submission. They may not recognize the danger until it erupts.\n\nTiming Critical: The rising must coordinate with crusade operations. If it erupts too early, Ottoman retaliation will crush it before help arrives. If too late, its value is diminished.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #2: Success of Serbian National Rising\n\n\nThis roll determines how effectively the Serbian resistance organizes over the next 18 months, whether it remains secret until the critical moment, and what complications arise.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nBetrayal and Catastrophe: The conspiracy is betrayed—a captured messenger, a tortured priest, a boyar who sells his soul for Ottoman favor. Murad learns of the planned rising. The retaliation is swift and terrible. Đurađ is summoned to Adrianople. Serbian leaders are executed. The resistance is crushed before it begins, and Serbia enters the war broken and bleeding.\n11-20\nPremature Discovery: Ottoman intelligence detects unusual activity—too many weapons, too many whispers, too many sullen faces. Full conspiracy is not revealed, but suspicion falls on the Despotate. Đurađ must explain himself. Serbian preparations are disrupted, key leaders arrested. The rising will still occur, but weakened and disorganized.\n21-35\nPartial Exposure: Some elements of the conspiracy are discovered, others remain hidden. The Ottomans know something is wrong but not the full extent. Increased surveillance, punitive measures against suspected communities. The rising will occur but faces active countermeasures.\n36-50\nFragile Secrecy: The conspiracy holds together, barely. There are close calls—a suspicious official, a careless word, a messenger who nearly falls into Turkish hands. By 1441, Serbian preparations are complete, but the Ottomans are uneasy. The rising will achieve tactical surprise but not strategic shock.\n51-65\nSuccessful Concealment: Ottoman complacency—Murad's own disinterest—extends to Serbian affairs. The rising preparations go undetected. When the crusade strikes, Serbian resistance will erupt as a complete surprise to Ottoman commanders.\n66-80\nCoordinated Preparation: The Serbian network achieves excellent coordination with Hungarian crusade planners. Timing is synchronized. Targets are identified. When the crusade crosses the Danube, Serbian guides will be waiting. When Ottoman supply lines stretch south, Serbian partisans will cut them. A well-planned joint operation.\n81-90\nBalkan Coordination: The Serbian rising connects with Wallachian preparations. Đurađ and Vlad Dracul establish communication through Orthodox church networks. The two Christian vassals coordinate their timing—when one rises, the other follows. The Ottoman flank and rear simultaneously threatened.\n91-95\nWider Balkan Network: Beyond Wallachia, the Serbian rising inspires preparation among Bulgarians, Albanians, and Greeks. The Orthodox Church network carries the message of hope. When Serbia rises, it will not rise alone. The entire Christian Balkans trembles on the edge of revolt.\n96-100\nThe Second Kosovo: Serbian preparations reach a fever pitch of national awakening. The memory of 1389 is invoked not as tragedy but as prophecy—the martyrs of Kosovo will be avenged. Warriors make pilgrimage to the battlefield to swear oaths. The rising, when it comes, will carry the force of religious destiny. Serbia does not merely join the crusade; Serbia becomes a crusade.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Success of Serbian National Rising."

The Serbian conspiracy holds together, but there are close calls. The Ottomans are uneasy by 1441, even if they don't know exactly what's happening. The rising will achieve tactical surprise but not strategic shock.\n\nLet me narrate this outcome and then move on to the next faction on our list - the Karamanid Beylik.\n\n\nRoll 49 — Fragile Secrecy\n\n\n\nThe conspiracy holds. Barely.\n\n\nThere are moments when everything nearly unravels.\n\n\nIn the autumn of 1439, an Ottoman customs officer in Niš grows suspicious of a monk traveling with unusually heavy saddlebags. He orders a search. The monk—carrying letters from Đurađ to Serbian communities in Kosovo—protests, invokes the sanctity of church correspondence, creates a scene. The officer, unwilling to provoke an incident with the Orthodox Church over what is probably nothing, relents. The monk rides on, heart pounding, letters intact.\n\n\nIn the winter, a Serbian boyar drinks too much at a feast where Ottoman merchants are present. He toasts \"the day of liberation\" before his brother kicks him under the table. The merchants exchange glances but say nothing. Perhaps they did not hear clearly. Perhaps they did not understand. Perhaps they simply do not care enough to report the ramblings of a drunken provincial noble.\n\n\nIn the spring of 1440, Ottoman tax collectors in Kosovo note that several villages have failed to provide their usual levy of young men for the devşirme—the child-tribute that feeds the janissary corps. Excuses are offered: plague, poor harvests, young men fled to the hills. The collectors accept the excuses, but they file reports. The reports sit in provincial offices, unread, unremarked—but they exist.\n\n\nBy the summer of 1440, a pattern has emerged that a careful observer might notice. Weapons shipments to monasteries. Unusual travel by Orthodox clergy. Villages that seem both poorer and more defiant than before. Serbian merchants who ask too many questions about Ottoman troop movements.\n\n\nThe Ottomans are not careful observers. Murad hunts. His officials focus on larger concerns—the coming war with the Christians, the eternal intrigues of the court. Serbia has been quiet for decades. Why would it change now?\n\n\nBut there is unease. Provincial commanders report that something feels wrong without being able to articulate what. The air in Serbian lands carries a tension that was not there before. Experienced officers trust their instincts, even when they cannot justify them.\n\n\n\nWhat This Means\n\n\nThe Serbian rising will occur. When the crusade strikes, Đurađ will declare for Christendom, and the networks he has built will activate across Serbian lands.\n\n\nBut the Ottomans are not entirely blind. They suspect something, even if they do not know what. When the rising erupts:\n\n\nTactical surprise will be achieved: Ottoman commanders will not expect Serbian troops to turn on them, Serbian villages to become hostile territory, Serbian partisans to cut supply lines.\n\nStrategic shock will be limited: The general Ottoman unease means some contingency preparations exist. Garrisons are slightly more alert. Punitive forces can be assembled faster than if the rising came from complete darkness.\n\nTiming remains critical: If the rising activates too early—before crusader forces are in position to support it—Ottoman retaliation could crush it despite the surprise. Đurađ must wait for the right moment.\n\nThe Kosovo rising is uncertain: Serbian communities beyond the Despotate have received the message, but without the secrecy being perfect, some have grown cautious. The Kosovo rising will occur, but perhaps not with the full force it might have had.\n\n\nSerbian Status for 1441: A national rising is prepared and will activate when the crusade arrives. Tactical surprise is likely; strategic shock is not. The conspiracy has survived but left traces that make Ottoman response faster than it would otherwise be. A valuable ally, but one whose full potential is slightly compromised by eighteen months of near-misses.\n\n\n\nCombined Balkan Picture\n\n\nThe situation in the Balkans is now remarkably favorable for the crusade:\n\n\nWallachia (Roll 96): A full resistance network poised for revolt, intelligence pipeline to Hungary, potential third front\n\nSerbia (Roll 99, then 49): National rising prepared, tactical surprise likely, but fragile secrecy means Ottoman unease\n\n\nThese two results together create a scenario where the Ottoman rear and flank are both threatened by coordinated Christian resistance. The crusade will not fight alone—it will be supported by Balkan populations ready to rise against their oppressors.\n\n\n\nKARAMANID BEYLIK — Strategic Assessment\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\nThe Karamanid Beylik in central Anatolia is the last significant Turkish rival to Ottoman dominance in Asia Minor. İbrahim II Bey rules from Konya, nursing generations of hatred toward the Ottoman dynasty that has steadily devoured Karamanid territory. His father fought the Ottomans. His grandfather fought the Ottomans. He has fought the Ottomans.\n\n\nBut İbrahim has also lost to the Ottomans. Repeatedly. The Karamanids survive only because the Ottomans have been distracted by European expansion. Every few years, Murad turns east, crushes Karamanid resistance, extracts tribute and hostages, then returns to the Balkans. The cycle continues.\n\n\nWhat the Karamanids Know:\n\n\nA massive Christian crusade is forming against the Ottomans\n\nIf the crusade engages Murad in the Balkans, Anatolia will be stripped of troops\n\nThis could be the moment to strike—to reclaim lost territories while the Sultan is distracted\n\nBut if the crusade fails quickly, Ottoman vengeance will be terrible\n\nThe Mamluks have made quiet overtures of anti-Ottoman solidarity\n\n\nKaramanid Interests:\n\n\nSurvival of the beylik against Ottoman absorption\n\nRecovery of lost Anatolian territories\n\nRevenge for generations of humiliation\n\nAvoiding destruction if the crusade fails\n\nPotential alliance with other Ottoman enemies (Mamluks, other beyliks)\n\n\nStrategic Options:\nİbrahim must decide: exploit Christian distraction with an eastern attack on the Ottomans, maintain cautious neutrality, or make some lesser move that tests Ottoman attention without fully committing.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #1: Karamanid Strategic Choice\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nCowed Submission: İbrahim has been beaten too many times. He fears Ottoman retaliation more than he desires Ottoman defeat. The Karamanids remain quiet, pay their tribute, and pray the storm passes. No threat to Ottoman rear.\n16-30\nWatchful Waiting: İbrahim prepares for action but commits to nothing. He gathers troops, stockpiles supplies, watches events in the Balkans. Only if the crusade achieves significant victories will he consider moving. Pure opportunism, no risk.\n31-45\nProbing Actions: The Karamanids test Ottoman attention with border raids, disputed territories occupied, tribute payments delayed. Not open war, but aggressive posturing that forces the Ottomans to watch their eastern flank. Nuisance level.\n46-60\nMamluk Coordination: İbrahim responds to Mamluk overtures. The two powers agree to coordinate pressure on the Ottomans—not alliance, but parallel action. If the crusade strikes from the west and Karamanids from the east while Mamluks threaten from the south...\n61-75\nOpportunistic Offensive: İbrahim commits to attacking when the crusade engages Ottoman main forces. Not before—he will not draw Ottoman attention prematurely. But when Murad marches north to face the Christians, Karamanid armies will march west.\n76-85\nBold Eastern Front: İbrahim decides the moment has come. Full Karamanid mobilization. When the crusade begins, the Karamanids will launch a major offensive to reclaim lost territories and threaten the Ottoman heartland. A genuine second front in Anatolia.\n86-95\nAnatolian Coalition: İbrahim reaches out to other Turkish beyliks and disaffected Ottoman vassals in Anatolia. A coalition forms—Karamanids, remnants of other beyliks, ambitious Ottoman governors who see opportunity. The eastern threat multiplies.\n96-100\nStrategic Masterstroke: İbrahim coordinates directly with crusade leadership through intermediaries. Timing is synchronized. When Christian forces cross the Danube, Karamanid forces cross the Ottoman frontier. The Ottomans face true two-front war, unable to concentrate against either threat.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Karamanid Strategic Choice."

Not open war, but aggressive posturing that forces the Ottomans to watch their eastern flank. Nuisance level.\n\nNow I need to describe this choice and then create a second table to see how successful these probing actions are.\n\n\nRoll 43 — Probing Actions\n\n\n\nİbrahim II Bey has learned caution the hard way.\n\n\nThree times in his reign, he has risen against Ottoman dominance. Three times, Murad has marched east, crushed Karamanid resistance, and extracted humiliating concessions. İbrahim still bears the scar on his shoulder from Murad's last campaign—an arrow that nearly ended Karamanid independence permanently.\n\n\nHe will not commit to open war. Not yet. Not based on Christian promises from kings he has never met, fighting battles a thousand miles away.\n\n\nBut neither will he sit idle while opportunity whispers.\n\n\nThe orders go out from Konya with deliberate ambiguity. Border garrisons are reinforced—\"defensive measures,\" nothing more. Karamanid cavalry patrols push deeper into disputed territories, claiming to chase bandits. Villages that have paid tribute to both powers are reminded, firmly, that Karamanid protection requires Karamanid taxes. Ottoman customs posts on contested roads find their collectors harassed by \"unknown raiders.\"\n\n\nTribute payments to the Sultan, due in autumn, are delayed. Apologetic letters explain difficulties—poor harvests, administrative confusion, surely the mighty Sultan understands. The payments will come. Eventually. Perhaps.\n\n\nIt is not war. İbrahim can disavow any specific incident, punish any commander who goes \"too far,\" prostrate himself before Ottoman envoys with practiced humility. But it is pressure. It is annoyance. It is a message: the Karamanids are watching, and the Karamanids remember.\n\n\nMost importantly, it forces the Ottomans to watch their eastern flank. Troops that might reinforce the Balkans must remain in Anatolia. Commanders who might focus entirely on the Christian threat must divide their attention. Every soldier guarding against Karamanid opportunism is a soldier not facing crusader lances.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #2: Success of Karamanid Probing Actions\n\n\nThis roll determines how effectively the Karamanids execute their harassment campaign, whether it achieves strategic effect, and what complications arise.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nProvocation Backfires: Ottoman commanders, already uneasy about the coming crusade, interpret Karamanid probing as coordinated Christian treachery. A punitive expedition is dispatched—not a full campaign, but enough to bloody the Karamanids and remind them of their place. İbrahim is forced to grovel. Karamanid pressure ceases entirely; Ottoman attention returns fully to the Balkans.\n11-20\nDismissed as Routine: The Ottomans have dealt with Karamanid border friction for decades. Provincial commanders handle the incidents through established channels—bribes, threats, minor retaliations. No strategic effect; the probing is absorbed without disrupting Ottoman planning.\n21-35\nMinor Irritation: Karamanid actions register as an annoyance but not a threat. Some additional troops remain in eastern Anatolia as precaution, but the numbers are small. A marginal drain on Ottoman resources—perhaps a few hundred cavalry kept from the Balkan theater.\n36-50\nSuccessful Nuisance: The probing campaign achieves its intended effect. Ottoman commanders cannot ignore the eastern frontier entirely. Garrison troops remain in place. Patrol schedules continue. Strategic reserves that might have marched west stay in Anatolia \"just in case.\" A measurable but modest diversion of Ottoman attention.\n51-65\nGrowing Ottoman Concern: Karamanid aggression exceeds what provincial forces can manage quietly. Reports reach Edirne of \"unusual Karamanid activity.\" Murad—or his viziers—must make decisions about eastern troop levels. Several thousand soldiers are kept in Anatolia who might otherwise reinforce the Balkans.\n66-75\nStrategic Hesitation: Ottoman war planners cannot be certain the Karamanids won't escalate. Contingency plans must account for a potential eastern front. The uncertainty itself becomes a strategic factor—Ottoman response to the crusade is slightly slower, slightly more cautious, as commanders hedge against Anatolian threats.\n76-85\nDelayed Tribute Hurts: The withheld tribute payments create genuine financial pressure. Ottoman war preparations, already hampered by Murad's complacency, face additional resource constraints. The money that should fund Balkan defense sits in Karamanid coffers.\n86-95\nOpportunistic Expansion: Emboldened by Ottoman distraction, Karamanid forces occupy several disputed border districts permanently. Not open war, but territorial gain. Ottoman prestige suffers; other Anatolian powers take note. The eastern frontier shifts in Karamanid favor.\n96-100\nEscalation Dynamic: Karamanid probing triggers a cycle of escalation. Ottoman retaliation invites Karamanid counter-retaliation. By 1441, the eastern frontier is actively hostile—not quite war, but requiring substantial Ottoman forces to contain. İbrahim, having intended only harassment, finds himself committed to a level of confrontation that genuinely threatens Ottoman strategic flexibility.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Success of Karamanid Probing Actions."

Some additional troops remain in eastern Anatolia as precaution, but the numbers are small. A marginal drain on Ottoman resources—perhaps a few hundred cavalry kept from the Balkan theater.\n\nSo this is a minor success - the Karamanids are causing some minor irritation but not a significant strategic effect. Let me narrate this outcome and then move to the next faction on the list.\n\nThe next faction should be the Council of Basel vs. Pope Eugenius IV - the ongoing schism in the Church.\n\n\nRoll 28 — Minor Irritation\n\n\n\nThe Karamanid probing achieves less than İbrahim hoped.\n\n\nOttoman provincial commanders have dealt with Karamanid border friction for generations. They know the pattern: raids, delayed tribute, territorial nibbling—followed by apologies, restored payments, and a return to sullen submission when Ottoman attention finally turns eastward. This is simply how the Karamanids behave. It requires management, not alarm.\n\n\nThe Beylerbey of Anatolia dispatches stern messages to Konya demanding explanation for the \"bandit activity\" along the frontier. İbrahim responds with elaborate courtesy and transparent lies. The tribute payments arrive—late, incomplete, but sufficient to avoid open breach. A few Karamanid commanders are publicly punished for \"unauthorized\" raids. The disputed villages continue paying taxes to both powers, as they have for decades.\n\n\nSome Ottoman cavalry remain in eastern Anatolia as precaution. A few hundred horsemen, perhaps a thousand at most, stationed in frontier towns to discourage further Karamanid adventurism. Provincial garrisons maintain their usual strength rather than being stripped for western deployment.\n\n\nIt is not nothing. Every soldier watching the Karamanid border is a soldier not facing the crusade. But it is far less than İbrahim intended—a minor drain on Ottoman resources rather than a strategic distraction.\n\n\nThe veteran Ottoman commanders simply do not believe the Karamanids pose a serious threat. They have beaten İbrahim too many times. When the crusade is defeated, they assume, the Sultan will turn east and administer another lesson. Until then, the Karamanids can be contained with routine measures.\n\n\nKaramanid Status for 1441: A minor irritation on the Ottoman eastern frontier. Perhaps 500-1,000 Ottoman cavalry kept in Anatolia who might otherwise reinforce the Balkans. Tribute payments delayed but eventually rendered. No significant strategic effect on the coming campaign. İbrahim watches and waits, unwilling to commit further without evidence that the crusade will actually succeed.\n\n\n\nCOUNCIL OF BASEL VS. POPE EUGENIUS IV — Strategic Assessment\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\nThe Western Church remains divided. The Council of Basel, asserting conciliar supremacy over papal authority, continues to sit in defiance of Pope Eugenius IV's attempts to dissolve or relocate it. The conflict has simmered for years—Eugenius in Rome (and sometimes Florence), the Council in Basel, each claiming to represent true Church authority.\n\n\nJuan has worked with Eugenius, forging the Fidei Defensio agreement and supporting papal authority against conciliar pretensions. But the Council of Basel still commands significant support, particularly among French clergy, some German princes, and reformist factions who see the Council as the best hope for Church renewal.\n\n\nWhat the Council Knows:\n\n\nPope Eugenius is promoting a crusade led by his ally, King Juan of Castile\n\nSuccess would strengthen papal prestige enormously—Eugenius as the Pope who organized Christian victory\n\nThe Council's relevance continues to fade; a great papal triumph might marginalize it entirely\n\nSome Council fathers genuinely support crusade; others see it as a papal power play\n\nFrance, embroiled in the Hundred Years' War, has little interest in eastern adventures\n\n\nCouncil Interests:\n\n\nMaintaining conciliar authority against papal centralization\n\nChurch reform (their original mandate, largely unfulfilled)\n\nPreventing Eugenius from claiming sole credit for any crusade success\n\nRetaining support from France, Germany, and reform-minded clergy\n\nInstitutional survival in the face of declining relevance\n\n\nStrategic Options:\nThe Council must decide how to respond to the crusade—support it and risk strengthening Eugenius, oppose it and risk appearing to obstruct holy war, or find some middle path that preserves conciliar relevance.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #1: Council of Basel Strategic Choice\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nActive Opposition: The Council condemns the crusade as a papal power grab disguised as holy war. They question Eugenius's authority to call crusade, challenge the indulgences offered, and urge Christian princes to focus on Church reform rather than eastern adventures. Open ecclesiastical warfare against the crusade.\n16-30\nSullen Obstruction: The Council does not openly oppose the crusade but refuses to endorse it. No conciliar blessing, no support for preaching the cross in territories sympathetic to Basel, quiet discouragement of participation. Passive resistance that complicates crusade recruitment in France and Germany.\n31-45\nGrudging Neutrality: The Council neither supports nor opposes. Individual Council fathers may preach the crusade or condemn it as they choose. The institution takes no position, preserving its options while avoiding direct conflict with popular crusading enthusiasm.\n46-60\nReluctant Endorsement: Political reality forces the Council's hand—opposing holy war against the Turk is indefensible. Basel issues its own crusade endorsement, carefully worded to assert conciliar authority alongside papal. An attempt to share credit rather than cede it entirely.\n61-75\nParallel Crusade Promotion: The Council actively promotes the crusade but frames it as a conciliar initiative, emphasizing Basel's earlier calls for Christian unity against the Ottoman threat. Compete with Eugenius for credit rather than opposing the enterprise itself.\n76-85\nReconciliation Opportunity: Moderate voices in Basel see the crusade as a chance to heal the schism. They propose joint papal-conciliar leadership of the crusade effort, shared credit, mutual recognition. An olive branch that might—or might not—be accepted.\n86-95\nEnthusiastic Support: The Council genuinely embraces the crusade, setting aside institutional rivalry for the greater cause. Basel's moral authority is thrown behind the enterprise. French and German clergy who look to Basel receive clear encouragement to support the holy war.\n96-100\nCouncil Dissolved in Crusade Unity: The crusade becomes the catalyst for ending the schism. Council fathers travel to Rome to reconcile with Eugenius under the banner of Christian unity against Islam. The institutional conflict dissolves in shared purpose. A transformed Church enters the crusade united.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Council of Basel Strategic Choice."

Looking at the campaign history, Juan has been deeply involved in Church reform efforts:\n\n1. The Council of Basel has passed significant reform decrees - on electoral reform, clerical concubinage, pluralism, annates\n2. Juan worked with Pope Eugenius IV to implement \"parallel legislation\" - having the Pope issue reforms independently that mirror Council decrees, thus achieving reform without conceding the Haec Sancta question of conciliar supremacy\n3. The Compacts of Basel resolved the Hussite crisis\n4. Various other reforms have been implemented\n\nSo the Council's original mandate of Church reform HAS been substantially fulfilled - just not entirely through conciliar authority alone. The remaining dispute is primarily about the constitutional question of whether councils are superior to popes (Haec Sancta), not about whether reform happens.\n\nThis changes the Council's strategic position significantly. They've achieved much of what they set out to do on reform. Their remaining relevance is primarily about:\n1. The Haec Sancta constitutional question\n2. Ongoing oversight/implementation of reforms\n3. Any remaining reform agenda items\n4. Their institutional pride and desire not to be simply dismissed\n\nLet me revise the assessment to reflect the actual campaign history.\n\n\nYou're absolutely right, and I apologize for the error.\n\n\nLooking at the campaign history, the Council of Basel has achieved substantial reforms: electoral reform decrees, measures against clerical concubinage, decrees on pluralism, the annates reform, the Compacts of Basel resolving the Hussite crisis. Juan's \"parallel legislation\" strategy—having Eugenius issue papal reforms that mirror conciliar decrees—has allowed genuine reform to proceed while sidestepping the Haec Sancta constitutional question.\n\n\nThe Council's remaining dispute with Eugenius is primarily about authority, not reform outcomes. The question is: does the Council hold supreme authority over the Pope (as Haec Sancta asserts), or is the Pope supreme?

POPE EUGENIUS IV — Revised Strategic Assessment\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\nThe Western Church remains technically divided, but the Council of Basel's position has weakened considerably. The great reforms have been achieved—electoral reform, measures against concubinage and pluralism, annates restructured, the Hussite crisis resolved through the Compacts of Basel. Juan's brilliant \"parallel legislation\" strategy allowed these reforms to proceed with both conciliar and papal blessing, sidestepping the constitutional crisis.\n\n\nWhat remains is the unresolved question of Haec Sancta: does the Council hold supreme authority over the Pope, or vice versa? It is a question of principle, of ecclesiology, of who ultimately governs the Church. But it is increasingly an abstract question. The reforms are done. The practical work is finished. The Council continues to sit in Basel, asserting its authority, but with diminishing purpose.\n\n\nWhat the Council Knows:\n\n\nPope Eugenius is promoting a crusade led by his ally, King Juan of Castile\n\nSuccess would crown Eugenius's pontificate with glory—the Pope who defeated the Turk\n\nThe Council's relevance is already fading; a great papal triumph might extinguish it entirely\n\nOpposing a crusade against Islam is politically and morally indefensible\n\nFrance, their strongest supporter, is consumed by the Hundred Years' War\n\nMany Council fathers are weary; some have already drifted away to Rome\n\n\nRevised Council Interests:\n\n\nVindicating Haec Sancta—the principle of conciliar supremacy, even if reforms are accomplished\n\nPreventing Eugenius from claiming sole credit for the accomplished reforms AND the crusade\n\nInstitutional survival now that their practical mandate is fulfilled\n\nFinding a new purpose that justifies continued existence\n\nAvoiding appearing as obstructionists against holy war\n\n\nThe Council's Dilemma:\nThey cannot oppose the crusade—no Christian body can openly obstruct war against the infidel. But supporting it means strengthening Eugenius. Their position is fundamentally weak: a body whose work is largely done, clinging to a constitutional principle while the Pope leads Christendom to war.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #1: Council of Basel Strategic Choice\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nBitter Obstruction: Despite the political cost, hardline conciliarists attempt to undermine the crusade. They question Eugenius's authority to issue crusade bulls, challenge the validity of indulgences granted without conciliar approval, and urge princes to demand Church governance reform before funding eastern wars. A desperate, self-destructive gambit that damages the Council's reputation more than the crusade.\n11-20\nPassive Resentment: The Council issues no statement on the crusade—neither blessing nor condemnation. In territories sympathetic to Basel, clergy receive no clear guidance; some preach the cross, others remain silent. French and German recruitment suffers slightly from this ambiguity. The Council preserves its dignity by saying nothing, but appears increasingly irrelevant.\n21-35\nGrudging Acceptance: The Council cannot oppose holy war. A tepid endorsement is issued, acknowledging the crusade's merit while pointedly noting that conciliar authority remains unresolved. An attempt to maintain principle while bowing to reality. No practical obstruction, but no enthusiastic support either.\n36-50\nCredit-Claiming Endorsement: The Council endorses the crusade but frames it as the culmination of conciliar work—Basel's reforms strengthened the Church, Basel's resolution of the Hussite crisis freed resources for eastern war, Basel's prayers sustain the enterprise. An attempt to share the glory rather than cede it entirely.\n51-65\nPragmatic Cooperation: Moderate Council fathers recognize reality. They endorse the crusade fully, encourage preaching in French and German territories, and quietly seek accommodation with Rome. The constitutional question is set aside for now—perhaps a victorious, grateful Eugenius will be more amenable to compromise afterward.\n66-80\nReform Legacy Argument: The Council enthusiastically supports the crusade while emphasizing that victory is only possible because of conciliar reforms. A reformed Church can crusade; an unreformed Church could not. Basel's legacy is vindicated through the crusade's success. Both Council and Pope can claim credit.\n81-90\nReconciliation Overture: The crusade becomes an opportunity for healing. Council moderates propose joint papal-conciliar blessing of the enterprise, a shared ceremony of Christian unity before the great campaign. The constitutional question is deferred, not resolved—but cooperation replaces conflict.\n91-95\nConciliar Submission: Weary of irrelevance, the Council majority votes to accept papal supremacy in exchange for confirmation of all accomplished reforms. Basel's work is preserved; Basel's authority is surrendered. The Church enters the crusade united, the schism ended through exhaustion rather than resolution.\n96-100\nTriumphant Synthesis: A face-saving formula emerges that allows both Pope and Council to claim victory. Eugenius acknowledges conciliar contribution to reform; the Council acknowledges papal leadership of the crusade. Haec Sancta is quietly shelved rather than repudiated. The Church reunites in time for holy war, its internal conflict dissolved in shared purpose against the greater enemy.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Council of Basel Strategic Choice."

      "say": "Thought process: Evaluated political strategy's practical effectiveness and messaging impact.\n\nThe player rolled 69, which falls in the range 66-80: \"Reform Legacy Argument\"\n\nThe Council of Basel has chosen to enthusiastically support the crusade while emphasizing that victory is only possible because of conciliar reforms. This is a clever political positioning - they support the crusade (which they must) while claiming that their work made it possible.\n\nNow I need to create a table for how successful this strategy is in practice. The Council is trying to:\n1. Support the crusade fully\n2. Claim credit for making it possible through reforms\n3. Maintain relevance and prestige\n4. Position themselves favorably regardless of outcome\n\nThis is actually a fairly savvy political move. The success roll should determine:\n- How effectively they communicate this message\n- Whether it gains traction in France, Germany, and elsewhere\n- Whether Eugenius accepts or contests this framing\n- What the practical effect is on crusade recruitment and Church unity\n\n\nRoll 69 — Reform Legacy Argument\n\n\n\nCardinal Louis Aleman, the Council's president, is no fool.\n\n\nHe has watched the Council's relevance fade as the great reforms were accomplished—many through Juan of Castile's clever parallel legislation that gave credit to both Rome and Basel. He has seen Council fathers drift away, returning to their dioceses or making quiet peace with Eugenius. He knows that a rump council asserting abstract constitutional principles while the Pope leads Christendom to glorious war is a council that will soon sit empty.\n\n\nBut there is another path. A way to support the crusade—which the Council must do—while ensuring Basel is not forgotten.\n\n\nThe Council issues a ringing endorsement of the holy enterprise. But the endorsement is carefully crafted.\n\n\n\"The Council of Basel, gathered in the Holy Spirit, celebrates the great crusade against the enemies of Christ. We call upon all Christian princes and peoples to take up the cross, to follow the banner of the Church Militant, to liberate our brothers in the East from the Turkish yoke.\n\n\n\"Let it be known that this holy enterprise is possible only because the Church has been renewed. The reforms accomplished at Basel—the purification of elections, the correction of clerical abuses, the resolution of the Bohemian schism, the restoration of discipline throughout Christendom—have prepared the Bride of Christ for this great work. A corrupt Church could not crusade. A reformed Church, united in purpose, marches forth invincible.\n\n\n\"We commend Pope Eugenius for his leadership in this sacred cause, even as we remind Christendom that the reforms which make victory possible bear the seal of this holy Council. Let Rome and Basel together receive the thanks of a grateful Church when Constantinople is relieved and the Turk driven from Christian lands.\"\n\n\nIt is masterful positioning. The Council supports the crusade without reservation. But every sermon preached from this endorsement will remind listeners that Basel's reforms made it possible. If the crusade succeeds, the Council shares the glory. If it fails, the Council's work remains—reforms that strengthened the Church regardless of military outcome.\n\n\nCardinal Aleman permits himself a thin smile. They will not be forgotten.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #2: Success of the Reform Legacy Argument\n\n\nThis roll determines how effectively the Council's message spreads, whether it gains acceptance, and what practical effect it has on crusade recruitment, Church unity, and the Council's continued relevance.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nMessage Rejected: Eugenius is furious at the attempt to share credit. Papal representatives actively counter the Council's narrative, emphasizing that reforms came through papal authority, that the Council merely ratified what Rome ordained. The resulting ecclesiastical squabbling confuses the faithful and dampens crusade enthusiasm in disputed territories. Both sides lose.\n11-20\nIgnored in the Excitement: The Council's careful messaging is drowned out by crusade fervor. No one cares about constitutional niceties when Christendom marches to war. Basel's endorsement is welcomed; Basel's claim to credit is forgotten. The Council remains irrelevant despite its efforts.\n21-35\nPartial Traction: The Reform Legacy argument resonates in territories already sympathetic to Basel—parts of France, some German principalities. Elsewhere, it is ignored or dismissed. The Council maintains its existing support base but fails to expand it. A holding action, not a victory.\n36-50\nAccepted but Not Celebrated: The Council's endorsement is received positively. The claim that reforms enabled crusade is acknowledged as reasonable, if self-serving. Basel's reputation stabilizes. Crusade preaching in French and German territories proceeds without obstruction. Neither triumph nor failure for the conciliar position.\n51-65\nEffective Positioning: The Reform Legacy argument gains genuine traction. Preachers across Europe incorporate the message—a reformed Church marches to war. The Council's contribution to Christendom is acknowledged alongside papal leadership. Basel's relevance is preserved; the constitutional question remains open.\n66-75\nNarrative Success: The Council's framing becomes widely accepted. Even papal supporters acknowledge that Basel's reforms strengthened the Church for this great enterprise. The Council enters the crusade period with enhanced prestige, positioned to claim shared credit for whatever success follows.\n76-85\nFrench and German Enthusiasm: The Reform Legacy argument particularly resonates in France and Germany, where conciliar sympathies run strongest. Crusade recruitment in these territories—previously uncertain—strengthens as clergy enthusiastically preach both holy war and conciliar achievement. A measurable contribution to crusade manpower.\n86-95\nEugenius Accepts the Framing: Recognizing the value of Church unity, Eugenius chooses not to contest the Council's narrative. Papal statements begin acknowledging \"the reforms accomplished by Pope and Council together.\" A de facto reconciliation of messaging, if not of constitutional principle. The Church presents a united face to Christendom.\n96-100\nFoundation for Reunion: The shared crusade narrative creates unexpected momentum for ending the schism. If both Pope and Council can claim the reforms, if both can share crusade glory, perhaps the constitutional question can be resolved through compromise rather than confrontation. Quiet negotiations begin for a formal reconciliation that preserves everyone's dignity.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Success of the Reform Legacy Argument."

This makes sense - we've covered the Council of Basel's position, now we need to see how the Pope handles things.\n\nLet me think about Eugenius IV's situation:\n\n1. He has a strong alliance with Juan of Castile through the Fidei Defensio agreement\n2. The parallel legislation strategy has allowed reforms to proceed while preserving papal authority\n3. A successful crusade would enormously strengthen his position\n4. The Council of Basel still technically exists but is weakened\n5. He needs to rally Christian support for the crusade\n6. He has various political challenges - the ongoing conciliar dispute, Italian politics, etc.\n\nWhat are Eugenius's strategic options?\n- How actively does he promote the crusade?\n- Does he try to reconcile with Basel or marginalize them?\n- Does he commit Church resources (money, indulgences, diplomatic pressure)?\n- Does he try to bring in other Christian powers (France, Burgundy, the German princes)?\n\nLet me draft a strategic assessment and d100 table for Eugenius's approach.\n\n\nRoll 53 — Effective Positioning\n\n\n\nThe Council's message spreads through the capillaries of the Church.\n\n\nIn cathedral chapters sympathetic to Basel, canons discuss the endorsement with satisfaction. The Council has not surrendered; it has claimed its rightful share of glory. In university halls where conciliar theory was born, theologians note approvingly that Basel's reforms are acknowledged as the foundation for Christian renewal. In French dioceses where bishops have long looked to Basel rather than Rome, the endorsement provides clear guidance: support the crusade, preach the cross, and remind the faithful that a reformed Church makes this possible.\n\n\nThe message is not universal. In Italy, in Spain, in territories firmly loyal to Eugenius, the Council's claim to credit is dismissed or ignored. Papal supporters see no need to acknowledge Basel's contribution when Rome leads the enterprise. But neither do they actively contest the narrative—the crusade is too important for ecclesiastical squabbling.\n\n\nThe result is a stable equilibrium. Both Pope and Council support the crusade. Both claim credit for the reforms that enable it. The constitutional question of Haec Sancta remains unresolved, but it recedes into the background as Christendom focuses on the greater enemy. Basel's relevance is preserved; its authority is neither vindicated nor extinguished.\n\n\nCouncil of Basel Status for 1441: Effectively positioned to share credit for crusade success. Strong support in France and Germany for the Reform Legacy narrative. No obstruction of crusade recruitment. Constitutional question deferred, not resolved. The Council will survive the crusade period, but its ultimate fate depends on what comes after.\n\n\n\nPOPE EUGENIUS IV AND ROME — Strategic Assessment\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\nPope Eugenius IV has navigated treacherous waters for nearly a decade. Driven from Rome by rebellion, challenged by the Council of Basel, his authority questioned across Europe—yet he has survived. The alliance with Juan of Castile has been his great triumph: the Fidei Defensio agreement, the parallel legislation strategy that allowed reform while preserving papal prerogatives, the title of Defensor Romaniae granted to a Christian king who actually defends Christendom.\n\n\nNow that king prepares the greatest crusade since the fall of Acre. If it succeeds, Eugenius will be remembered as the Pope who turned back the Ottoman tide. If it fails, his pontificate—and perhaps the papacy itself—may never recover.\n\n\nWhat Eugenius Knows:\n\n\nJuan of Castile is his most valuable ally, committed to both crusade and papal authority\n\nPoland-Hungary has joined the alliance, creating a genuine military coalition\n\nThe Council of Basel has endorsed the crusade while claiming shared credit for reforms\n\nVenice is hedging; Genoa is committed but hampered by Venetian interference\n\nThe Ottomans appear complacent, but appearances can deceive\n\nChurch resources—money, diplomatic pressure, spiritual authority—must be mobilized\n\n\nPapal Interests:\n\n\nSuccess of the crusade (glory for Christendom and for his pontificate)\n\nStrengthening papal authority through demonstrated leadership\n\nMarginalizing or reconciling with the Council of Basel\n\nMobilizing Christian princes who have not yet committed (France, Burgundy, German states)\n\nEnsuring the Church provides material support (crusade taxation, indulgences, loans)\n\nMaintaining the alliance with Juan as the cornerstone of papal strategy\n\n\nStrategic Options:\nEugenius must decide how aggressively to promote the crusade, how to handle the Council's credit-claiming, and how to mobilize the full resources of the Church for holy war.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #1: Papal Strategic Choice\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nCautious Minimalism: Eugenius fears failure. He issues the required crusade bulls but commits minimal papal resources. If the crusade fails, he can distance himself; if it succeeds, he can claim credit afterward. A hedging strategy that provides little practical support to Juan's enterprise.\n11-20\nRhetorical Support Only: Grand bulls, soaring rhetoric, prayers and processions—but limited material commitment. Eugenius preaches crusade without funding it, leaving the burden on secular princes. Indulgences are issued; crusade taxation is not seriously enforced. Words without substance.\n21-35\nStandard Crusade Promotion: Eugenius follows the traditional papal playbook. Crusade bulls are issued. Indulgences are offered. Crusade taxation is proclaimed (though collection varies by kingdom). Diplomatic letters urge Christian princes to participate. Competent but uninspired leadership.\n36-50\nActive Engagement: Eugenius commits seriously to the enterprise. Papal diplomats pressure wavering princes. Church finances are directed toward crusade support. The Pope personally preaches the cross in Rome. A genuine effort to mobilize Christendom, though limited by papal resources and political constraints.\n51-65\nFull Mobilization: Eugenius throws everything into the crusade. Aggressive crusade taxation across all territories acknowledging papal authority. Diplomatic missions to France, Burgundy, the German princes. Church lands pledged as collateral for loans. The papacy commits its prestige and resources without reservation.\n66-75\nStrategic Alliance Building: Beyond mobilizing Church resources, Eugenius works to expand the coalition. Diplomatic pressure on Venice to abandon its hedging. Overtures to France despite the Hundred Years' War. Appeals to Burgundy's crusading tradition. Attempts to transform Juan's alliance into a pan-European enterprise.\n76-85\nReconciliation with Basel: Eugenius accepts the Council's Reform Legacy framing, choosing unity over institutional rivalry. Joint papal-conciliar promotion of the crusade. The constitutional question is set aside; Church unity is prioritized. A reformed, united Church marches to war.\n86-95\nPersonal Leadership: Eugenius considers accompanying the crusade himself, or sending a cardinal legate with full papal authority to bless the armies. The Pope's personal involvement signals ultimate commitment and raises the spiritual stakes of the enterprise. Christendom's supreme pastor leads his flock to war.\n96-100\nTransformative Vision: Eugenius seizes the crusade as an opportunity to reshape Christendom. Church reunion with the Greeks (already partially achieved), reconciliation with Basel, mobilization of all Christian powers, papal leadership of a united Christendom against Islam. The crusade becomes not just a military campaign but a spiritual renewal of the Christian world.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Papal Strategic Choice."

Mamluk Sultanate - DONE (Hostile neutrality to Ottomans, but overreached and created backlash)\n3. Hafsid Sultanate - DONE (Defensive preparation, adequate defense)\n4.

Council of Basel - DONE (Reform legacy argument, effective positioning)\n11. René of Anjou - NOT DONE YET\n\nSo only René of Anjou remains. Let me also roll for how Eugenius's \"Active Engagement\" plays out, then move to René of Anjou.\n\n\nRoll 38 — Active Engagement\n\n\n\nEugenius IV has waited his entire pontificate for this moment.\n\n\nDriven from Rome by the Colonna, challenged by Basel, mocked by princes who saw papal authority as a relic of a fading age—he has endured it all. Now, at last, a Christian king offers him something real: not empty promises, but armies, fleets, and the genuine prospect of victory against the enemies of Christ.\n\n\nThe Pope commits.\n\n\nFrom the Lateran Palace, a stream of bulls flows across Christendom. Sanctissimus Dominus Noster proclaims the crusade in ringing Latin, offering plenary indulgences to all who take the cross or contribute to the enterprise. Cogitanti Mihi directs the bishops of Europe to preach holy war from every pulpit. In Suprema Dignitatis establishes crusade taxation—a twentieth of all Church revenues for three years, directed to the defense of Christendom.\n\n\nEugenius preaches personally. In Saint Peter's Basilica, the aged Pope mounts the pulpit and calls upon the faithful with tears in his eyes. The fall of Constantinople would be the death of Christian civilization in the East. The Sultan's armies threaten Rome itself. Only united action can preserve what remains of Christendom's ancient heritage.\n\n\nPapal diplomats are dispatched to every court. They carry letters, promises, threats. Princes who contribute will receive papal favor; princes who refuse will face papal displeasure. The Church's spiritual authority is placed squarely behind Juan's military enterprise.\n\n\nIt is not everything—Eugenius lacks the resources for \"full mobilization,\" and political constraints limit what pressure he can bring. France is consumed by war with England. The German princes are fractious and distracted. But within those limits, the Pope does what he can.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #2: Success of Papal Active Engagement\n\n\nThis roll determines how effectively Eugenius's efforts translate into practical crusade support—money raised, diplomatic pressure applied, Christian unity strengthened.\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nEmbarrassing Failure: Crusade taxation is widely evaded. French bishops cite the English war; German princes ignore papal letters. The gap between Eugenius's rhetoric and actual response humiliates the papacy. Less support materializes than if the Pope had remained quiet.\n11-20\nDisappointing Returns: Some crusade funds are collected, but far less than hoped. Diplomatic pressure yields polite refusals. The Pope's commitment is evident; Christendom's response is lukewarm. A modest contribution that falls well short of expectations.\n21-35\nUneven Results: Papal efforts succeed in some territories, fail in others. Italian states contribute; France contributes little; Germany is mixed. The crusade receives meaningful papal support, but Eugenius cannot claim to have united Christendom.\n36-50\nCompetent Execution: Crusade taxation is collected at reasonable rates across most territories. Papal diplomacy reinforces existing commitments without creating new ones. The Church contributes its expected share. Neither triumph nor failure—workmanlike support for the enterprise.\n51-65\nEffective Mobilization: Eugenius's personal commitment inspires genuine response. Crusade funds flow to Rome in meaningful quantities. Wavering princes are pressured toward participation. The papacy demonstrates it can still lead Christendom when the cause is just.\n66-75\nDiplomatic Successes: Papal pressure achieves concrete results. A German prince commits troops he had withheld. Burgundy sends a contingent despite French complications. Venice receives pointed reminders of Christian duty. The coalition expands beyond its original members.\n76-85\nFinancial Windfall: Crusade taxation and indulgence sales exceed expectations. The Pope can offer Juan substantial financial support—perhaps 100,000 florins or more—to offset campaign costs. Papal gold strengthens crusade logistics.\n86-95\nRenewed Papal Authority: The crusade becomes a demonstration of restored papal leadership. Eugenius's active engagement contrasts favorably with Basel's mere endorsement. Princes who had looked to the Council begin looking to Rome again. The papal position strengthens regardless of military outcome.\n96-100\nChristendom Responds: Eugenius's call achieves something remarkable—genuine pan-European enthusiasm. Even France, despite its English war, sends a token force. German princes compete to demonstrate crusading zeal. The crusade becomes not Juan's enterprise or Eugenius's enterprise, but Christendom's enterprise. A transformative moment for papal leadership.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for Success of Papal Active Engagement.\n\n\n\nRemaining on the List:\n\n\nWe have completed:\n\n\n✓ Ottoman Empire (Complacent; capable subordinates maintain readiness)\n\n✓ Mamluk Sultanate (Hostile neutrality to Ottomans; overreach creates complications)\n\n✓ Hafsid Sultanate (Defensive preparation; adequate defense)\n\n✓ Marinid Sultanate (Opportunistic corsairs; strategic nuisance)\n\n✓ Venice (Hedging all bets; intelligence windfall)\n\n✓ Genoa (Genuine commitment; undermined by Venetian interference)\n\n✓ Wallachia (Reluctant Ottoman support; secretly building revolt network)\n\n✓ Serbia (National rising prepared; fragile secrecy)\n\n✓ Karamanid Beylik (Probing actions; minor irritation)\n\n✓ Council of Basel (Reform legacy argument; effective positioning)\n\n✓ Pope Eugenius IV (Active engagement; awaiting success roll)\n\n\nOnly one remains:\n\n\nRené of Anjou & French Interests — The man Juan defeated at Aversa, who lost Naples to Alfonso V.

But across Italy, across Iberia, across the territories where papal authority still commands respect, the call to holy war finds willing ears.\n\n\nCrusade taxation is collected with reasonable efficiency. Bishops who might have delayed or embezzled find papal auditors arriving to inspect their accounts. The message is clear: Eugenius is serious, and Rome is watching. In Florence, the Medici bank—already bound to Juan through the Conventio Bancaria—facilitates the transfer of Church funds to crusade accounts. In Naples, Alfonso V ensures that his kingdom's clergy contribute generously.\n\n\nThe indulgences sell well. Common folk who cannot take the cross themselves purchase remission of sins for deceased relatives, funding holy war through accumulated small coins. Wealthier patrons endow masses for crusade victory. The spiritual economy of Christendom turns, however briefly, toward the East.\n\n\nPapal diplomacy reinforces existing commitments. Letters to Władysław praise his courage and promise eternal glory. Letters to Juan remind him that he carries the hopes of Christendom. Letters to Alfonso emphasize the sacred duty of the House of Trastámara. The wavering are pressured; the committed are encouraged; the hostile are warned of divine displeasure.\n\n\nEugenius cannot claim to have united all Christendom. France sends nothing. The German princes send little. Venice continues its mercantile hedging. But the Pope has demonstrated that he can still lead when the cause is just. The papacy contributes meaningfully to the enterprise—perhaps 50,000-75,000 florins in direct support, plus the incalculable value of spiritual legitimacy.\n\n\nPapal Status for 1441: Actively engaged in crusade promotion with effective results. Meaningful financial contribution to crusade logistics. Spiritual authority firmly behind the enterprise. Papal prestige tied to crusade outcome—success will strengthen Eugenius enormously; failure will wound him badly. The Church, if not fully united, is at least broadly supportive of holy war.\n\n\n\nRENÉ OF ANJOU & FRENCH INTERESTS — Strategic Assessment\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\nRené, Duke of Anjou, Count of Provence, titular King of Naples, sits in his French domains and broods.\n\n\nFive years ago, he held Naples—or nearly held it. His army defended against Alfonso of Aragon. Victory seemed possible. Then Juan of Castile arrived with his battle-hardened veterans of the Reconquista. The night march. The dawn battle at Aversa. The destruction of René's cavalry. The surrender that stripped him of his Italian kingdom.\n\n\nHe remembers kneeling before Juan, accepting terms, thanking the Castilian king for sparing his men's lives. The gratitude was genuine—Juan had been merciful. But gratitude does not erase humiliation. A king who has lost a kingdom does not forget.\n\n\nNow that same Juan marches east with his armies, leaving Iberia and Italy behind. Alfonso focuses on consolidating Naples, on Eastern adventures, on his childless marriage and uncertain succession. The Trastámara kings look away from the West.\n\n\nWhat René Knows:\n\n\nJuan and Alfonso will be occupied with the crusade for at least a year, possibly longer\n\nNaples is held by Aragonese forces, but Alfonso cannot reinforce it while campaigning east\n\nFrance is embroiled in the Hundred Years' War, but René's own Provençal resources are his to command\n\nThe Pope supports the crusade—attempting to retake Naples would mean opposing Eugenius\n\nHis claim to Naples remains legally valid in French and Angevin eyes\n\nAny move against Naples while its defenders crusade would be seen as stabbing Christendom in the back\n\n\nRené's Interests:\n\n\nRecovering the Kingdom of Naples (his obsession)\n\nRestoring Angevin prestige after the humiliation of Aversa\n\nBalancing ambition against political and moral constraints\n\nMaintaining his position in French politics\n\nAvoiding excommunication or universal condemnation\n\n\nThe Dilemma:\nRené wants Naples. But attacking while Alfonso and Juan crusade would make him Christendom's villain—the prince who undermined holy war for personal ambition. Even France, his natural ally, might not support such naked opportunism. And yet... the opportunity may never come again.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #1: René of Anjou's Strategic Choice\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nBitter Acceptance: René recognizes the impossible politics. Attacking Naples during a crusade would damn him before God and man. He does nothing, nursing his grievance, waiting for some future opportunity that may never come. No threat to Aragonese interests.\n16-30\nDiplomatic Positioning Only: René reinforces his legal claim to Naples through diplomatic channels—letters to sympathetic cardinals, briefs filed with friendly lawyers, quiet conversations with Italian exiles. Building a case for the future without taking action now. No military threat.\n21-35\nFrench Court Lobbying: René focuses on securing French royal support for a future Naples campaign—after the crusade, after the English war, when circumstances permit. He builds political capital rather than spending it. Long-term positioning, no immediate action.\n36-50\nWatching and Waiting: René prepares quietly. His Provençal forces are maintained at readiness. Agents in Naples report on Aragonese dispositions. If the crusade fails catastrophically—if Alfonso dies, if chaos erupts—René will be ready to move. Opportunistic preparation without commitment.\n51-65\nProbing Actions: René tests the waters. Angevin agents in Naples stir discontent among barons who resent Aragonese rule. Provençal ships appear in Italian waters on \"commercial\" voyages. Nothing overtly hostile, but a reminder that the Angevin claim has not been abandoned.\n66-75\nCovert Destabilization: René actively works to weaken Aragonese Naples while maintaining plausible deniability. Gold flows to discontented Italian lords. Rumors spread questioning Alfonso's legitimacy. Mercenary captains receive quiet inquiries about future availability. Preparing the ground for eventual action.\n76-85\nAlliance Building: René reaches out to other powers with grievances against the Trastámara—Milanese exiles, Florentine rivals, perhaps even Ottoman contacts through Venetian intermediaries. Building a coalition for eventual action, even if that action must wait.\n86-95\nLimited Military Pressure: Despite the political risks, René moves some forces toward the Italian frontier. Not invasion, but positioning. A reminder that Angevin power exists, that Naples is not forgotten. Alfonso must consider whether to weaken crusade forces to guard against this threat.\n96-100\nBold Opportunism: René decides the crusade provides his best chance. While Christian armies march east, he will strike. Damn the political consequences—Naples is worth excommunication. Full mobilization for an Italian campaign timed to coincide with crusade operations. A desperate gamble that could reshape the Mediterranean.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 for René of Anjou's Strategic Choice."

However, the user is telling me that the character database clearly states Alfonso V is dead.\n\nThis is a significant continuity error on my part. I've been treating Alfonso V as alive throughout this entire strategic assessment, talking about:\n- \"Alfonso focuses on consolidating Naples\"\n- \"Alfonso cannot reinforce it while campaigning east\"\n- \"if Alfonso dies\"\n- etc.\n\nThe user is right to call this out. I've been hallucinating that Alfonso V is alive when apparently he died during the campaign. This is a major error that affects the entire strategic situation.\n\nLet me think about what I should have known:\n1. The user told me to read the CHARACTER_DATABASE at the start\n2. I read part of it but it was truncated\n3. I should have been more careful about character status\n4. I made assumptions about Alfonso being alive without verifying\n\nThe correct response is to:\n1. Acknowledge the error honestly\n2. Explain why I made the mistake (I didn't carefully verify Alfonso's status; the database was truncated and I didn't search for more information)\n3. Ask for clarification about what actually happened to Alfonso\n4. Offer to revise the René of Anjou assessment based on correct information\n\nThis is a significant error because Alfonso V's death would completely change:\n- The Naples situation\n- The succession question (he was childless)\n- René's strategic calculus\n- The entire western Mediterranean political situation\n\nI need to be honest about my mistake and correct it.\n\n\nYou are absolutely right to call this out, and I apologize for the error.\n\n\nLooking back at my process: I read the CHARACTER_DATABASE_UPDATED.md at the start of the chapter, but it was truncated after line 234. I did not search further or verify Alfonso V's status. I assumed he was alive based on my general knowledge of the historical period and because earlier chapter summaries mentioned him actively participating in events.\n\n\nThis is a failure on my part. I should have:\n\n\nNoticed the database was truncated\n\nSearched project knowledge specifically for Alfonso V's current status\n\nNot made assumptions about a major character's life or death\n\n\nLet me search now to correct my understanding:\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Reconciled outdated database information with current timeline discrepancy.\n\nI see - the search results show Alfonso V of Aragon is listed in the CHARACTER_DATABASE_UPDATED.md and his current task says \"Consolidating Naples, awaiting Giovanna II's death to secure claim\" and his location is \"Naples/Aragon.\"\n\nBut wait - the CHARACTER_DATABASE_UPDATED.md was last updated December 22, 2025 and it shows \"Current Timeline: February 1435\" - but we're now in September 1439! The database is several years out of date for our current timeline position.\n\nLet me search for more recent information about Alfonso V specifically related to his death.\n\n\nThe search shows the CHARACTER_DATABASE was last updated for the timeline up to February 1435, but we're now in September 1439. Let me search for more recent information about Alfonso's fate:\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Acknowledged critical error regarding character status and revised strategic assessment accordingly.\n\nNow I have much more information. From Chapter 2.42 Summary, I can see:\n\n\"Alfonso V died in September 1437, making Juan heir to Aragon and Naples\"\n\nSo Alfonso V is indeed dead. He died in September 1437, and Juan has inherited both Aragon and Naples. This completely changes the strategic situation:\n\n1. Juan now rules Castile, Aragon, Naples (plus his other holdings like Granada)\n2. There is no separate \"Alfonso\" to defend Naples - Juan IS the king of Naples\n3. René of Anjou's claim is now against Juan directly, not Alfonso\n4. The entire René of Anjou strategic assessment needs to be revised\n\nThis is a massive error on my part. I should have caught this. The user is right to call it out.\n\nLet me revise my understanding:\n- Alfonso V died September 1437\n- Juan inherited Aragon and Naples\n- Queen María (Juan's sister, Alfonso's widow) helped Juan navigate Aragonese politics\n- Naples accepted Juan enthusiastically (Roll 99 - \"il Liberatore\")\n- Aragon required hard bargaining at the Cortes of Zaragoza\n\nThis means the René of Anjou assessment should be about whether René attempts to reclaim Naples from JUAN, not from Alfonso.\n\n\nI found it. From Chapter 2.42 Summary:\n\n\"Alfonso V died in September 1437, making Juan heir to Aragon and Naples\"\n\nAnd:\n\n\"Naples Roll: 99 — Triumphant inheritance; Neapolitan lords declare for Juan as 'il Liberatore' before he presses claim\"\n\nSo Alfonso V has been dead for over two years by the time of this chapter (September 1439). Juan now holds five crowns: Castile, León, Granada, Aragon, and Naples. Queen María (Alfonso's widow, Juan's sister) helped him navigate the Aragonese succession at the Cortes of Zaragoza.\n\n\nThis completely changes the René of Anjou assessment. René's grievance is now against Juan directly, not Alfonso. Naples is defended by Juan's forces, and any attack on Naples while Juan crusades is an attack on Juan's own kingdom.\n\n\nLet me redraft the René of Anjou assessment with this corrected understanding:\n\n\n\nRENÉ OF ANJOU & FRENCH INTERESTS — Revised Strategic Assessment\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\nRené, Duke of Anjou, Count of Provence, titular King of Naples, has watched his fortunes collapse entirely.\n\n\nFirst, Juan of Castile arrived in Italy in 1434 and destroyed René's army at Aversa, securing Naples for Alfonso V. René surrendered, renounced his claims, and returned to France in humiliation.\n\n\nThen Alfonso died childless in 1437—and Naples passed not to René (whose claim might have been revived) but to Juan of Castile, Alfonso's designated heir. The Neapolitan lords declared for Juan as \"il Liberatore\" before he even pressed his claim. A roll of 99—triumphant inheritance.\n\n\nNow Juan holds five crowns. He is not merely an ally of Naples's king; he is Naples's king. The man who defeated René at Aversa now sits on the throne René coveted.\n\n\nWhat René Knows:\n\n\nJuan holds Naples directly—any attack is against Juan's own kingdom\n\nJuan is preparing a massive crusade against the Ottomans\n\nCastilian, Aragonese, and Neapolitan forces will be committed eastward\n\nNaples will be defended by garrison forces, not field armies\n\nThe Pope supports Juan's crusade—opposing it means opposing Eugenius\n\nFrance is consumed by the Hundred Years' War; royal support is uncertain\n\nHis Provençal resources are modest compared to Juan's empire\n\n\nRené's Interests:\n\n\nRecovering the Kingdom of Naples (now seemingly impossible)\n\nRestoring Angevin prestige after double humiliation (Aversa + inheritance loss)\n\nAvoiding appearing as Christendom's villain\n\nMaintaining his position in French politics\n\nAccepting reality—or refusing to accept it\n\n\nThe Deeper Dilemma:\nRené's situation is worse than before. Attacking Alfonso's Naples was one thing—Alfonso was a foreign conqueror, and René had a legal claim. Attacking Juan's Naples is different. Juan is the legitimate heir, acclaimed by the Neapolitan lords themselves, blessed by the Pope. Any move against Naples now is not pressing a rival claim—it is naked aggression against a crusading Christian king.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll #1: René of Anjou's Strategic Choice (Revised)\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-20\nBitter Acceptance: René recognizes the impossible politics. His claim died with Alfonso—Juan's inheritance is unassailable. He does nothing, nursing his grievance in Provence, a broken pretender to a throne he will never hold. No threat to Juan's interests.\n21-35\nDiplomatic Protest Only: René maintains his titular claim to Naples through letters and legal briefs, preserving Angevin honor without taking action. Future generations might press the claim; René will not. Words without substance.\n36-50\nFrench Court Lobbying: René focuses on securing French royal acknowledgment of his claim for the future—after the English war, after Juan's death, when circumstances might change. Long-term positioning, accepting he cannot act now.\n51-65\nWatching and Waiting: René maintains his Provençal forces at readiness and keeps agents in Naples. If the crusade fails catastrophically—if Juan dies in the East—opportunities might emerge. Pure opportunism without current action.\n66-75\nCovert Destabilization: René cannot attack openly, but he can make trouble. Gold flows to discontented Neapolitan barons. Rumors question Juan's legitimacy as an absentee foreign king. Preparing the ground for future instability, even if René himself cannot exploit it.\n76-85\nAlliance Building: René reaches out to others with grievances against Juan's growing empire—Milanese interests, Florentine rivals, perhaps even Ottoman contacts through Venetian intermediaries. Building a coalition for some future reckoning.\n86-95\nLimited Military Pressure: Despite the political risks, René moves forces toward the Italian frontier. Not invasion—he lacks the strength—but a reminder that Angevin power exists. Juan must consider whether to weaken crusade forces to guard against this threat.\n96-100\nDesperate Gamble: René decides that with Juan distracted and Naples weakened, this is his last chance. Full mobilization of Provençal resources for an Italian campaign. A mad gamble that could see him excommunicated and destroyed—or restored to a throne.\n\n\nYou already rolled 52 for this. Let me apply that to the revised table:\n\n\nRoll 52 — Watching and Waiting\n\n\n\nRené of Anjou paces the halls of his castle in Provence and contemplates the ashes of his ambitions.\n\n\nHe had accepted Alfonso's victory with what grace he could muster. A foreign conqueror, an Aragonese interloper—there was no shame in losing to overwhelming force. He had told himself that Alfonso might die childless, that the wheel of fortune might turn, that patience and faith would be rewarded.\n\n\nThen Alfonso did die childless. And Naples went to Juan of Castile.\n\n\nNot back to the Angevins. Not to René, whose blood claim predated Alfonso's by generations. To the man who had destroyed René's army at Aversa. To the Castilian king who now accumulated crowns like a miser accumulates coins—Castile, León, Granada, Aragon, and now Naples. Five kingdoms under one man. An empire in all but name.\n\n\nThe Neapolitan lords had not even waited to hear René's protest. They acclaimed Juan \"il Liberatore\" before he set foot in the kingdom. A roll of fortune so devastating that René wonders if God Himself has turned against the House of Anjou.\n\n\nHe cannot fight. Provence alone cannot challenge Juan's empire. France is bleeding against the English and has nothing to spare for Italian adventures. The Pope supports Juan's crusade with bulls and blessings. To attack Naples now would be to attack a crusading Christian king, to earn excommunication and universal condemnation, to destroy what little remains of Angevin honor.\n\n\nSo René waits. He watches.\n\n\nHis agents remain in Naples—merchants, priests, minor nobles who remember Angevin rule. They send reports: which barons are unhappy, which officials are corrupt, which garrison commanders are neglectful. The information is filed away, carefully catalogued, waiting for the day when it might prove useful.\n\n\nHis Provençal forces are maintained at readiness. Not expanded—he lacks the funds—but not disbanded either. If something happens in the East... if Juan falls in battle against the Turk... if chaos erupts in the five-kingdom empire with no clear succession...\n\n\nRené is fifty years old. He may never sit on the throne of Naples. But he will not abandon his claim while breath remains. And he will be ready, should fortune's wheel turn at last.\n\n\nRené of Anjou Status for 1441: Watching and waiting. No active threat to Naples. Agents maintained for intelligence gathering. Forces preserved but not mobilized. Will exploit catastrophic crusade failure if opportunity arises, but will not create that opportunity himself. A dormant threat, not an active one.\n\n\n\nSTRATEGIC SUMMARY — ALL FACTIONS ASSESSED\n\nFaction\nStrategy\nExecution\nNet Effect on Crusade\nOttoman Empire\nComplacency\nCapable subordinates maintain readiness\nSlight advantage to crusade (not fully mobilized)\nMamluk Sultanate\nHostile neutrality to Ottomans\nOverreach creates complications\nNeutral (no help to either side)\nHafsid Sultanate\nDefensive preparation\nAdequate defense\nNeutral (no threat or help)\nMarinid Sultanate\nOpportunistic corsairs\nStrategic nuisance\nMinor negative (5-10% naval diversion)\nVenice\nHedging all bets\nIntelligence windfall\nNeutral (helps neither side openly)\nGenoa\nGenuine commitment\nUndermined by Venice\nModerate positive (reduced from potential)\nWallachia\nReluctant Ottoman support\nFoundation for revolt\nStrong positive (intelligence + potential third front)\nSerbia\nNational rising\nFragile secrecy\nStrong positive (uprising prepared, tactical surprise likely)\nKaramanid Beylik\nProbing actions\nMinor irritation\nMarginal positive (small Ottoman diversion)\nCouncil of Basel\nReform legacy argument\nEffective positioning\nNeutral to slight positive (no obstruction)\nPope Eugenius IV\nActive engagement\nEffective mobilization\nModerate positive (50-75k florins, spiritual authority)\nRené of Anjou\nWatching and waiting\n—\nNeutral (no active threat)\n\n\nThe strategic picture is remarkably favorable for the crusade. The Ottomans are complacent. The Balkans are preparing to rise. No major power actively opposes the enterprise. The greatest threats are minor—Marinid corsairs, Venetian indifference, Genoese support reduced by rivalry.\n\n\nShall I provide a final consolidated summary of what Juan knows (or can reasonably learn through intelligence) about this strategic landscape as he returns to Toledo?"
