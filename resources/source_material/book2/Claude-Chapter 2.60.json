They're about to march south to take Tetouan. Based on the context:\n\n- The Tetouan campaign was planned for Spring 1440\n- The decision was to march overland from Ceuta after staging there\n- The army assembled near Toledo must be ~12,000 troops with 50 siege guns\n\nLet me search for more information about the most recent chapter summaries to understand the current state better.\n\n\nTool: list_directory\n\n\nThought process: Sought missing context to navigate narrative continuity.\n\nI can't access that path directly. Let me search for the most recent chapter summary, perhaps looking specifically for what I might have missed.\n\n\nBased on my search of project knowledge, I can see the most recent chapter summary available is Chapter 2.58 (November 24, 1439), which ended with the war council discussing strategy. There doesn't appear to be a Chapter 2.59 summary in the project files.\n\n\nYou've indicated we've made time jumps and the army is now assembled near Toledo, ready to march south to Tetouan. Given the planning from earlier chapters, this would place us in Spring 1440, with:\n\n\n~12,000 troops mustered\n\n45-50 siege guns ready\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique as overall commander\n\nThe Banu Rashid waiting with 2,500-3,000 followers (including 800 fighters)\n\n\nCould you provide me with the key details I need to continue accurately:\n\n\nThe exact current date (e.g., \"March 15th, 1440\")\n\nWhat happened between November 1439 and now — particularly:\nDid Juan complete his diplomatic journey to Florence, Hungary, and Poland?\n\nDid King Duarte grant staging rights at Ceuta?\n\nWhat did the coastal survey reveal?\n\nWas Queen Lucia's child born? (She was due March 1440)\n\nWho is present with Juan at the army camp near Toledo?\n\nAny other significant developments I should know about\n\n\nOnce I have this context, I'll present the chapter introduction properly and we can begin the march to Tetouan."

Start the chapter with the army assembled in fields near Toledo\n2. June 1440\n3. About to march south to Tetouan\n4. The unnamed daughter, the Rashids, the royal family, the Military Orders' Masters, etc. are all present\n\nLet me write the chapter introduction.\n\n\nNow I have the full picture from the previous chats. Let me present the chapter introduction:\n\n\n\nChapter 2.60\n\n\nJune 1440, Morning\n\n\nThe plains outside Toledo stretch beneath a cloudless sky. Twenty-nine thousand men stand in formation—the largest Christian army assembled for an Eastern crusade in living memory, though today a smaller portion will march south for a different purpose. The Castilian banner flies from the command pavilion, quartered castle and lion now adorned with the golden Iota that marks this force as something new.\n\n\nFifty war wagons form a demonstration wagenburg at the army's heart, their iron-reinforced hulls gleaming, chains coiled and ready. Pike blocks stand in disciplined rectangles. Artillery crews wait beside the gaps left for guns that have already sailed east to Constantinople. Everything about this army speaks of preparation—years of training, months of selection, the accumulated work of officers dispersed throughout the formations who learned their craft at the Royal Military Academy.\n\n\nBeside you on the reviewing platform stand the Masters of the Military Orders: Don Luis de Guzmán of Santiago, Don Pedro González de Padilla of Calatrava, and Don Gutierre de Sotomayor of Alcántara. Sir Thomas Beaumont watches nearby. And to your left, in a place of honor that has raised eyebrows among the watching nobility, stand Sheikh Abd al-Rahman ibn Rashid and his sons—Khalid, Tariq, Yusuf, and young Omar—observing the Christian army that will restore their family to the throne of Tétouan.\n\n\nTo your right stands Queen Lucia, still bearing the marks of her ordeal three months past. She holds your newest daughter—fragile but alive, still unnamed before the realm—while your other children watch the spectacle: Catalina at eight, Fernando at seven, Bianca, Teresa, Juana, and little Nicolás.\n\n\nThe horn has sounded. The formations have demonstrated their discipline. Now all eyes turn toward you.\n\n\nThe march to Tétouan awaits your command."

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated military movement and reconvened command structure for campaign review.\n\nThe player wants to march the army south toward Tetouan and review the campaign plan with commanders. Let me recall what we know from the previous chapters:\n\nFrom Chapter 2.53:\n- Force: 12,000 men, 50 siege guns (though the guns may have already sailed east)\n- Command: Don Rodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes as overall commander\n- Approach: Stage from Portuguese Ceuta (King Duarte granted permission), march overland ~40 miles\n- Allies: Banu Rashid with 2,500-3,000 followers including 800 fighters, contacts inside the city\n- The coastal survey was supposed to be completed by winter 1439\n\nWait - but the army assembled is 29,000 men for the Eastern crusade. The Tetouan operation was planned for 12,000 men. So Juan would be taking a portion of this army south for Tetouan, then returning, and eventually the larger force sails east in 1441.\n\nLet me narrate the march beginning and the command meeting to review the plan. I should:\n1. Describe the army moving south\n2. Have the commanders present the current plan based on what was established\n3. Include any updates from the coastal survey\n4. Stop and wait for Juan's input\n\nI need to be careful not to generate dialogue for Juan. I'll have the commanders present information and ask questions, then stop.\n\nKey commanders for Tetouan:\n- Don Rodrigo Manrique (appointed overall commander)\n- Don Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza (Admiral)\n- The Masters of Military Orders\n- The Rashids (Tariq is the military son)\n\nThe Rashids are present - they were on the reviewing platform.\n\nI should keep this relatively short since we're in dialogue/planning mode, and stop to let the player respond.\n\n\nThe order ripples through the formations. Standards dip in acknowledgment. Drums begin their steady beat.\n\n\nThe army moves.\n\n\nNot all twenty-nine thousand—twelve thousand have been designated for the African operation, the force size determined months ago. The remainder will continue their training, preparing for the greater journey east next spring. But twelve thousand is still a host that darkens the road south, a column that takes hours to pass any given point, a logistical enterprise that consumes fodder and water and patience in equal measure.\n\n\nThe royal family returns to Toledo with their escort. Lucia's health cannot endure days of marching, and the children—even Fernando, who begged to come—are too young for a campaign. You watch them go from horseback, Lucia's hand raised in farewell, the unnamed infant a small bundle in the nurse's arms.\n\n\nThen south. Through La Mancha's dry plains, past the silver-producing hills of the Sierra Morena, toward the coast.\n\n\n\nCommand Pavilion, Three Days South of Toledo\n\n\nThe map spreads across the campaign table—Commander Martín's intelligence work made tangible. The coastline from Ceuta to south of Tétouan, marked with soundings, beach assessments, watchtower positions. Don Rodrigo Manrique anchors one corner of the map; Don Fadrique the Admiral holds another. The Masters of the Military Orders stand along the edges. Tariq al-Rashid, the military-minded son, has been invited to attend.\n\n\nDon Rodrigo summarizes:\n\n\n\"King Duarte granted staging rights at Ceuta six months ago. The coastal survey completed in winter confirmed what we feared—the beaches near Tétouan itself remain hostile. Rocky approaches, silted river mouth, the only accessible landing directly under their walls.\" He traces the route with a scarred finger. \"We stage at Ceuta, march forty miles southwest along the coast road. Three days, perhaps four with the guns.\"\n\n\nHe glances at you.\n\n\n\"The fleet transports us to Ceuta, then repositions to blockade Tétouan's harbor while we march. Once we arrive, Pietro Calabrese's guns reduce the walls. The Rashid contacts inside—\" a nod to Tariq \"—open what gates they can. We take the city, install the new lords, fortify against Rif counterattack.\"\n\n\nTariq speaks, his Castilian accented but clear: \"My father's agents report the garrison numbers perhaps two thousand. Poorly paid, poorly led. The current warlord is hated. When your guns speak and our banners rise, we believe many will simply... leave.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo's expression suggests he has heard such optimism before. \"And if they don't leave?\"\n\n\n\"Then we kill them,\" Tariq says simply. \"But we would prefer not to destroy the city we mean to rule.\"\n\n\nThe commanders wait for your assessment."

Let me check the previous chapter summaries for context.\n\nFrom Chapter 2.53, I found that:\n- **Don Rodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes** was appointed overall commander of the Tetouan operation\n- He was to be second-in-command when Juan is present\n- He has full command authority when Juan leaves or is called away\n- He formally swore oath of service before the council\n\nSo the answer is clear - Don Rodrigo Manrique was already appointed to this role back in 1439 during the war council planning session. The GM should remind Juan of this appointment.\n\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique straightens, a flicker of something—surprise? concern?—crossing his weathered face.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I was appointed to command this operation a year ago. I swore the oath before the war council.\" His voice is careful, respectful, but there's a question beneath it. \"Has something changed?\"\n\n\nDon Álvaro, who has been silent until now, clarifies quietly: \"Don Rodrigo holds full command authority when Your Majesty is absent or called away. When you are present, he serves as your second. That was the arrangement made in Toledo, summer of last year.\"\n\n\nThe other commanders nod. This was settled—Don Rodrigo spent months coordinating with the Rashids, reviewing the coastal intelligence, drilling the artillery crews on rapid deployment. He knows this operation better than anyone except perhaps Tariq al-Rashid himself.\n\n\nDon Rodrigo meets your eyes. \"If Your Majesty wishes to appoint another, I will of course defer. But I would know the reason.\"\n\n\n\nThe question hangs in the air. Don Rodrigo Manrique, Count of Paredes—veteran of the Granada campaigns, trusted commander, the man who has prepared this expedition for a year—awaits your answer."

Now they're asking Don Rodrigo for his honest assessment of the operation's chances.\n\nDon Rodrigo is a veteran commander - he should give an honest, professional assessment. He's been planning this for a year, knows the intelligence, knows the risks. He shouldn't be overconfident (that would be unrealistic for a seasoned commander) but he also shouldn't be pessimistic given the favorable factors:\n\nFavorable:\n- 12,000 troops vs ~2,000 garrison\n- 45-50 siege guns - massive artillery advantage\n- Rashid contacts inside the city\n- Naval superiority ensuring supply lines\n- Portuguese staging at Ceuta secured\n- Good intelligence from Commander Martín's network\n- Rashid followers (2,500-3,000 including 800 fighters) to assist\n\nRisks:\n- Rif tribes could mass and attack during or after siege\n- March from Ceuta (40 miles) gives defenders warning\n- Unknown factors - weather, disease, unexpected resistance\n- This is the first African campaign since Ceuta - institutional experience is limited\n- Academy officers are \"theoretical but untested\" (from the earlier roll)\n\nDon Rodrigo should be confident but not arrogant. He's a professional soldier who understands that war always holds surprises.\n\n\nDon Rodrigo's shoulders ease slightly. He nods, accepting the clarification, and turns back to the map.\n\n\n\"Problems? Always. War is problems.\" He taps the coastline. \"The march from Ceuta gives them three or four days' warning. They will know we are coming. A garrison that might have surrendered to surprise may stiffen when they have time to think, to pray, to remember what happens to cities that fall.\"\n\n\nHis finger moves to the mountains behind Tétouan. \"The Rif. They hate the current warlord, yes. They may hate us more. If they mass while we're besieging the walls...\" He shrugs. \"Twelve thousand men can hold against tribal cavalry, especially with wagons and guns. But it complicates things.\"\n\n\nDon Fadrique adds: \"Weather. June in the strait is usually calm, but storms happen. If we're caught mid-crossing with the army split between ships...\"\n\n\n\"Disease,\" says Sir Thomas Beaumont quietly. \"Africa has fevers unknown in Castile. The men are healthy now. They may not stay so.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo absorbs these contributions, then faces you directly.\n\n\n\"Confident? Yes, Your Majesty. I am confident.\" His voice carries the weight of thirty years of war. \"We have six times their numbers. We have guns that can reduce their walls to rubble. We have allies inside and outside the city. We have naval supremacy. We have been planning this for a year.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"But I have seen confident men die. I have seen certain victories turn to ash. So I will say this: if the enemy fights as we expect, if the Rashid contacts perform as promised, if the Rif stay in their mountains, if disease spares us and weather favors us—then Tétouan falls within a fortnight of our arrival, and the Rashids rule before summer's end.\"\n\n\nA grim smile.\n\n\n\"And if God wills otherwise, we will adapt. That is what soldiers do.\"\n\n\nTariq al-Rashid speaks: \"My family has waited three generations for this, Don Rodrigo. We will not fail you. The contacts will perform. The gates will open.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo regards the young Muslim lord for a long moment, then nods. \"Then we understand each other.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to you.\n\n\n\"With your leave, Your Majesty, we continue the march.

I need to draft a d100 table for this phase of the operation - the march to Málaga, the sea crossing to Ceuta, and the landing/staging there.\n\nLet me think about the factors involved:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n1. Extensive planning - a full year of preparation\n2. Portuguese cooperation - King Duarte granted staging rights\n3. Naval supremacy - the Castilian fleet controls the strait\n4. Good intelligence - Commander Martín's network provided reliable information\n5. Experienced commanders - Don Rodrigo, the Military Order Masters, academy officers\n6. Well-trained troops - selected from 35,000, drilled in new tactics\n7. June weather - typically calm in the strait\n8. Friendly port - Ceuta is Portuguese, not hostile territory\n9. Short crossing - Málaga to Ceuta is perhaps 60 miles\n10. Logistical preparation - supplies pre-staged\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n1. Large army logistics - 12,000 men require enormous supplies\n2. Sea crossing risks - even calm weather can turn\n3. Disease - always a risk when armies concentrate\n4. Potential for accidents - loading/unloading heavy equipment\n5. Unknown factors - war is unpredictable\n6. Portuguese cooperation variable - bureaucracy, local officials\n7. Enemy intelligence - spies may have warned Tétouan\n\nThis is a relatively straightforward logistical operation - moving an army from Málaga to a friendly port. The risks are real but manageable. Most outcomes should be in the \"success with minor issues\" to \"smooth success\" range, with extremes possible but unlikely.\n\nLet me draft the table:\n\n\nMARCH AND STAGING: MÁLAGA TO CEUTA\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS\n\n\nOne year of preparation — logistics planned in detail\n\nPortuguese cooperation — King Duarte granted staging rights months ago\n\nNaval supremacy — Castilian fleet controls the strait\n\nShort crossing — Málaga to Ceuta is roughly sixty miles, one day's sail\n\nFriendly port — Ceuta is Portuguese territory, not hostile\n\nJune weather — typically calm sailing conditions\n\nExperienced officers — Don Rodrigo, Don Fadrique, academy graduates throughout\n\nCoastal intelligence — Commander Martín's network mapped the waters\n\nPre-staged supplies — provisions arranged at both Málaga and Ceuta\n\nDisciplined troops — selected and drilled for months\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS\n\n\nTwelve thousand men — massive logistical burden even in best conditions\n\nSea crossing inherent risks — accidents, ships colliding, men falling overboard\n\nDisease — concentrated armies breed sickness\n\nLoading/unloading delays — heavy equipment, horses, supplies take time\n\nWeather variability — June is usually calm, not always\n\nPortuguese bureaucracy — local officials may complicate staging\n\nEnemy awareness — spies in Málaga could warn Tétouan\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: MARCH AND CROSSING TO CEUTA\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-3\nDisaster at sea. Storm catches the fleet mid-crossing. Ships scattered, some lost. Hundreds of men drowned. Equipment at the bottom of the strait. The expedition must regroup—weeks of delay, reduced strength, shattered morale.\n4-8\nSerious setback. Storm, collision, or outbreak of fever strikes the crossing. Significant losses—men, horses, or critical supplies. The army reaches Ceuta but weakened. Tétouan's defenders gain time to prepare.\n9-15\nTroubled crossing. Bad weather delays departure or scatters ships. No major losses, but days lost and men exhausted. Portuguese officials prove difficult. The army stages at Ceuta in poor spirits.\n16-25\nMinor complications. Delays in loading, a ship runs aground (refloated), sickness among some companies, friction with Portuguese garrison. Nothing catastrophic, but the operation runs behind schedule.\n26-40\nAdequate execution. The crossing proceeds without major incident. Some minor delays, some seasickness, the usual complaints of armies in transit. The army reaches Ceuta intact and ready, roughly on schedule.\n41-60\nSmooth operation. Good weather, competent seamanship, efficient loading and unloading. The army crosses in good order, stages at Ceuta without incident. Portuguese cooperation is professional. On schedule, morale high.\n61-75\nExcellent execution. Everything proceeds better than planned. Fair winds, calm seas, efficient coordination. The army reaches Ceuta a day ahead of schedule, well-rested and eager. Portuguese garrison impressed by Castilian discipline.\n76-88\nOutstanding success. The crossing is a model of military logistics. Not a man lost, not a horse lamed, not a day wasted. The army stages at Ceuta in perfect order. Don Rodrigo's planning vindicated. Morale soars.\n89-96\nRemarkable fortune. Everything aligns perfectly—weather, logistics, cooperation. The crossing takes less time than the most optimistic estimates. A Tétouan spy ship is captured fleeing the harbor, providing fresh intelligence. The enemy loses their warning.\n97-100\nBlessed by God. The fleet crosses as if guided by divine hand. A Rif messenger is intercepted carrying word that tribal chiefs have decided not to aid Tétouan's defense. The army arrives fresh, informed, and facing an isolated enemy.\n\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty."

Nothing went wrong, but nothing went especially right either. The army is intact and ready to proceed with the march to Tétouan.\n\n\nRoll: 30 — Adequate Execution\n\n\n\nThe crossing proceeds without major incident.\n\n\nThe fleet departs Málaga at dawn on a June morning, the strait calm enough but not glassy—a moderate swell that sets landlubber soldiers gripping rails and retching over gunwales. The ships spread across the water in reasonable order, though Don Fadrique curses the captain of the Santa Clara for drifting too far east and forcing a correction that costs two hours.\n\n\nLoading at Málaga took longer than planned. The horses, as horses do, decided collectively that wooden gangplanks leading into dark holds were instruments of death. Three broke free and had to be chased through the harbor district. A supply manifest was discovered to be wrong—forty barrels of salt pork listed that did not exist—requiring hasty redistribution from other ships. Don Rodrigo's jaw tightened with each delay, but he said nothing that wasn't necessary.\n\n\nCeuta's harbor receives the fleet by late afternoon. The Portuguese garrison is professional but not warm—they have their orders from King Duarte, and they fulfill them exactly, no more. Berthing assignments are correct. Water is available at the agreed price. Staging grounds outside the walls are where they were promised to be.\n\n\nBut the Portuguese commander, a weathered fidalgo named Gonçalo de Sintra, makes clear through a dozen small courtesies withheld that Castilian boots on Portuguese soil are tolerated, not welcomed. His men watch your army disembark with expressions that mix curiosity and wariness.\n\n\n\"They remember that Ceuta was supposed to be the beginning of Portuguese Africa,\" Don Álvaro murmurs as you watch the unloading. \"Instead it has been an expensive garrison for twenty-five years, while we took Granada. They are... not jealous, exactly. But not pleased either.\"\n\n\nBy nightfall, the army is ashore. Twelve thousand men camp in the fields south of Ceuta, cook fires dotting the darkness, the smell of salt air mixing with smoke and horse dung and the sweat of soldiers far from home.\n\n\nDon Rodrigo reports: \"We are one day behind schedule. Two men drowned in the crossing—one fell, one jumped after him and neither could swim. A dozen horses injured in unloading, three badly enough to be unfit for service. Otherwise, intact.\"\n\n\nHe looks toward the southwest, where Tétouan lies forty miles distant.\n\n\n\"They know we're here. They've known since we landed. Every hour we wait, they prepare.\"\n\n\n\nThe march to Tétouan awaits. Do you proceed immediately at dawn, or rest the men first?"

This is good strategic thinking - understanding the political landscape before proceeding.\n\nLet me think about who would be involved in or affected by a Castilian attack on Tétouan in 1440:\n\n1. **Tétouan itself** - The city garrison and current warlord. From earlier chapters, I know:\n- The garrison is about 2,000 men\n- Poorly paid, poorly led\n- The current warlord is hated\n- There are Rashid contacts inside (junior garrison officer, guild master with postern keys)\n\n2. **The Marinid Sultanate of Fez** - Morocco was ruled by the Marinid dynasty in this period, though they were in decline. The Sultan in Fez would have nominal authority over Tétouan and might feel obligated to respond to a Christian invasion.\n\n3. **The Rif Tribes** - The Berber mountain tribes of the Rif mountains behind Tétouan. From earlier chapters:\n- They hate the current warlord\n- Some chiefs might prefer Rashid restoration\n- But they might also hate Christians more\n- They're the major threat to a besieging army\n\n4. **The Wattasid Regents** - By the 1430s-1440s, the Marinid sultans were largely puppets of the Wattasid family who were the real power. This adds complexity to Moroccan politics.\n\n5. **Other Moroccan cities/powers** - Tangier, Salé corsairs, etc.\n\n6. **The Banu Rashid and their supporters** - The faction we're installing. Their contacts inside the city, the 2,500-3,000 followers including 800 fighters.\n\n7. **Portugal** - They hold Ceuta and have interests in the strait. They've cooperated, but they might have their own concerns about Castile expanding into \"their\" sphere.\n\n\nNow I need to assess how each faction might respond. The Marinid Sultan in Fez is weakened and may struggle to mount a serious defense, especially with the Wattasids controlling real power. The Rif tribes are unpredictable—they despise the current warlord but could unite against Christian forces. Portugal's position is delicate; they've been helpful but won't want Castile dominating the region. The Rashid faction has internal support but limited military strength. I should evaluate each group's capabilities and likely actions to understand the full scope of resistance and opportunity.\n\n\nA sound question. Don Álvaro calls for Isaac de Baeza's intelligence assessments, and the commanders gather to review the political landscape.\n\n\n\nFACTIONS INVOLVED IN THE TÉTOUAN CAMPAIGN\n\n\n1. TÉTOUAN GARRISON & WARLORD\n\n\nCurrent Ruler: Abu Zakariya al-Wattasi (called \"the Usurper\" by Rashid loyalists)\n\n\nSituation: A minor warlord who seized the city eight years ago during Marinid collapse. Commands perhaps 2,000 men—mercenaries, tribal levies, the dregs of what was once a garrison. Poorly paid, poorly supplied, held together by fear and the lack of alternatives.\n\n\nLikely Response: Must defend or lose everything. Has no retreat, no patron, no allies. Will fight or try to negotiate his own survival.\n\n\nKey Question: Does the garrison hold, fragment, or defect when the guns speak?\n\n\n\n2. THE MARINID SULTANATE OF FEZ\n\n\nCurrent Sultan: Abd al-Haqq II (a boy of perhaps twelve years, puppet of the Wattasid regents)\n\n\nSituation: The Marinid dynasty is in terminal decline. The Sultan rules in name only; real power belongs to the Wattasid viziers who keep him as a figurehead. Fez itself is torn by faction, its treasury empty, its armies scattered.\n\n\nDistance: Fez lies roughly 200 miles inland from Tétouan—two weeks' march through difficult terrain.\n\n\nLikely Response: The Wattasids may feel obligated to respond to a Christian invasion of Moroccan territory. But sending an army means stripping Fez of defenders while rivals circle. They may calculate that Tétouan is expendable.\n\n\nKey Question: Do the Wattasids march to relieve Tétouan, or write it off?\n\n\n\n3. THE RIF TRIBES\n\n\nLeaders: Various chiefs, no unified command\n\n\nSituation: The Berber tribes of the Rif mountains have never fully submitted to anyone—not the Marinids, not the current warlord, not anyone. They raid, they trade, they feud among themselves. Some hate the usurper in Tétouan. Some hate Christians more. Some simply want plunder.\n\n\nDistance: The Rif mountains begin immediately behind Tétouan. Tribal warriors could reach the siege within days.\n\n\nLikely Response: Unpredictable. Individual chiefs will make individual calculations. Some may see opportunity to loot a besieged city. Some may rally to defend Muslim soil against infidels. Some may wait to see who wins and then negotiate with the victor.\n\n\nKey Question: Do the Rif unite against us, stay neutral, or fragment into opportunism?\n\n\n\n4. THE BANU RASHID & THEIR NETWORK\n\n\nLeader: Sheikh Abd al-Rahman ibn Rashid (the patriarch, traveling with us)\n\n\nForces: 2,500-3,000 followers including 800 trained fighters; contacts inside Tétouan (junior garrison officer, guild master with postern keys)\n\n\nSituation: Three generations of exile end here. They have prepared for this moment, cultivated contacts, gathered supporters from the Granadan refugees. Their legitimacy depends on being seen as liberators, not collaborators.\n\n\nLikely Response: Fully committed. They will activate their contacts, rally supporters inside the walls, and attempt to minimize destruction to the city they mean to rule.\n\n\nKey Question: Do the Rashid contacts perform as promised? Does the population welcome them or resist?\n\n\n\n5. PORTUGAL (CEUTA GARRISON)\n\n\nCommander: Gonçalo de Sintra\n\n\nSituation: Portugal holds Ceuta as an isolated outpost—expensive, strategically important, but yielding little. They have cooperated with staging rights because King Duarte ordered it, but a strong Castilian presence in Morocco complicates their own ambitions.\n\n\nLikely Response: Officially neutral and cooperative. Unofficially... watching carefully. They will not sabotage us, but they will not extend themselves either.\n\n\nKey Question: Does Portugal remain professionally cooperative, or do \"complications\" arise?\n\n\n\n6. SALÉ CORSAIRS\n\n\nLeaders: Various corsair captains operating from Salé (Atlantic coast, south of Tangier)\n\n\nSituation: The corsairs prey on Christian shipping and have no love for Castile. But Salé is far from Tétouan—on the Atlantic coast, not the Mediterranean. Intervening would require sailing around Tangier and through the strait under Castilian naval dominance.\n\n\nLikely Response: Almost certainly nothing. The risk is too great, the distance too far, and corsairs fight for profit, not religion.\n\n\nKey Question: Do they stay out of it entirely, or does some ambitious captain try something foolish?\n\n\n\nPROPOSED ROLLS\n\nFaction\nKey Question\nImpact\nTétouan Garrison\nFight, fragment, or defect?\nDetermines siege difficulty\nMarinid/Wattasid Fez\nMarch to relieve, or abandon?\nPotential second army threat\nRif Tribes\nUnite, neutral, or fragment?\nThreat to siege/supply lines\nRashid Network\nContacts perform as promised?\nGates opened, intelligence, population response\nPortugal\nCooperate fully or create friction?\nSupply line security\n\n\nShall I draft d100 tables for each faction?"

The garrison is in a very weak position, so the table should reflect that - most outcomes should favor us, but there should be some variance.\n\n\nTÉTOUAN GARRISON RESPONSE\n\n\nSITUATION ASSESSMENT\n\n\nAbu Zakariya al-Wattasi's Position:\n\n\nCommands ~2,000 men of questionable loyalty\n\nSeized power through violence eight years ago; rules through fear\n\nNo external patron, no relief coming that he can count on\n\nTreasury depleted; soldiers paid irregularly\n\nKnows the Rashids have supporters inside his walls\n\nHas had three to four days' warning since Ceuta landing\n\nFacing 6-to-1 odds and siege artillery\n\n\nHis Options:\n\n\nFight — Man the walls, hope for Rif aid or Fez relief, trust that Christians tire of sieges\n\nNegotiate — Offer surrender in exchange for his life, wealth, and safe passage\n\nFlee — Abandon the city before we arrive, escape to the mountains with loyal men\n\nPurge and fight — Execute suspected Rashid sympathizers, terrorize the population into compliance\n\nFragment — His men make their own decisions; garrison dissolves into chaos\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: TÉTOUAN GARRISON RESPONSE\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDesperate atrocity. Al-Wattasi, knowing he cannot win, chooses spite. He executes prominent citizens suspected of Rashid sympathies, sets fires in the commercial quarter, and poisons wells before fleeing into the Rif with his most loyal men. The city is damaged, the population traumatized, and a blood feud begins.\n6-12\nFanatical resistance. Al-Wattasi rallies his men with appeals to faith and honor. The garrison fights with unexpected ferocity—not to win, but to make us bleed. Every street must be taken. Casualties mount. The city suffers greatly before it falls.\n13-20\nDetermined defense. The garrison mans the walls and fights professionally. No fanaticism, but no collapse either. Al-Wattasi maintains discipline through the siege. We must reduce the walls and storm the breaches. Standard siege, standard casualties.\n21-30\nDefensive but brittle. The garrison holds initially, but cracks appear as the bombardment continues. Desertions increase nightly. Al-Wattasi struggles to maintain order. The city will fall faster than a determined defense, but not without a fight.\n31-45\nNegotiation attempted. Al-Wattasi sends envoys before we reach the walls, offering to surrender in exchange for his life and safe passage with personal wealth. He calculates survival over glory. The terms are yours to accept or reject.\n46-60\nGarrison fragments. No unified response. Some units man the walls, others refuse, some try to flee. Al-Wattasi's authority collapses under pressure. Pockets of resistance remain, but coordinated defense is impossible. The city falls quickly once breached.\n61-72\nMass desertion. As our army approaches, soldiers slip away by ones and twos, then by dozens. By the time we reach the walls, al-Wattasi commands perhaps five hundred men. He flees in the night rather than face certain death. The city opens its gates at dawn.\n73-82\nInternal coup. The garrison officers, calculating odds, seize al-Wattasi and offer him to the Rashids as a peace offering. They open the gates in exchange for their lives and property. The city falls without a siege.\n83-90\nPopular uprising. The Rashid contacts prove more effective than hoped. As our army approaches, the population rises against al-Wattasi. Street fighting erupts inside the walls. By the time we arrive, Rashid supporters hold the gates and the warlord is dead or captured.\n91-96\nBloodless capitulation. Al-Wattasi sees the banners, counts the guns, and simply leaves—slipping out a postern gate with a handful of followers and whatever gold he can carry. The garrison, leaderless, surrenders without a fight. The city is intact.\n97-100\nRashid triumph. Everything aligns. Al-Wattasi is assassinated by his own guards—men whose families remember Rashid rule. The gates open before our vanguard arrives. The population welcomes the returning lords with genuine joy. Tétouan falls into Rashid hands like ripe fruit.\n\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty."

Actually, looking back at my earlier text, I called him \"al-Wattasi\" which suggests he might be related to the Wattasid viziers. This is an interesting wrinkle - they might actually NOT want to help him if he's a rival branch, or they might feel obligated because of clan ties.\n\nActually, historically the Wattasids eventually replaced the Marinids entirely. In the 1430s-1440s they were the power behind the throne.

The religious scholars of Fez force the regents' hand. A holy war is proclaimed against the Christian invaders. Every able man is called to defend the faith. An army of 8,000-10,000 marches for Tétouan—irregular, poorly supplied, but numerous and motivated. They will arrive in two to three weeks.\n5-10\nMajor relief expedition. The Wattasids calculate that losing Tétouan to Christians is unacceptable. They strip Fez of defenders and march with 5,000-6,000 men. Professional soldiers, not rabble. They aim to catch us besieging the walls. Arrival in two weeks.\n11-18\nModerate response. The regents send 2,000-3,000 men—enough to threaten our supply lines or reinforce the garrison if it holds, not enough to challenge us in open battle. They hedge their bets, preserving most of their strength. Arrival in two weeks.\n19-28\nToken force. A column of 500-800 cavalry departs Fez with great ceremony—enough to say they answered the call, not enough to matter. They will arrive after the city falls and withdraw when they see the situation. Honor satisfied, resources preserved.\n29-42\nDelayed response. The Wattasids argue among themselves. Some demand action, others counsel caution. By the time they reach a decision, weeks have passed. Any force they send arrives far too late to affect the outcome.\n43-58\nDiplomatic protest only. The regents send furious letters to every court in the Islamic world denouncing Castilian aggression. They demand the Sultan of Egypt intervene, appeal to the Ottoman Sultan, call for unity against the infidel. But no army marches. They cannot spare the men.\n59-72\nCalculated inaction. The Wattasids quietly decide that Tétouan is not worth the cost. Abu Zakariya was a rival anyway. Let the Christians have the coast; Fez will endure. No response beyond perfunctory condemnation.\n73-82\nInternal crisis prevents response. A rebellion, assassination attempt, or tribal uprising in the Fez region demands immediate attention. The Wattasids cannot respond to Tétouan even if they wished to—their own survival is at stake.\n83-90\nSecret relief. The regents publicly condemn the invasion but privately send word to the Rashids: they recognize the new order. Better a Rashid vassal to Castile than a rival Wattasid building power on the coast. No military response; quiet diplomatic feelers.\n91-96\nWattasid collapse accelerates. News of Tétouan's fall triggers a cascade of defections and rebellions across Morocco. The regents are too busy fighting for their own survival to care about a distant port. The Marinid Sultanate visibly crumbles.\n97-100\nOpportunity seized. A rival faction in Fez uses the distraction to move against the Wattasid regents. Civil war erupts in the capital. Morocco turns inward, tearing itself apart. Tétouan is forgotten in the chaos.\n\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty."

Annoying and costly in small ways, but no coordinated threat. We must detach troops to guard our lines.\n31-45\nWatchful neutrality. The chiefs gather in their mountain councils, debate endlessly, and reach no consensus. They watch the siege from a distance, waiting to see who prevails before committing.

One or two offer to sell us goats at outrageous prices. No unified action in either direction.\n59-68\nPragmatic neutrality. The chiefs calculate that fighting Christians gains them nothing. Abu Zakariya was no friend to them; why die for his city? They stay in their mountains, tending flocks, waiting for the new order to emerge.\n69-78\nQuiet cooperation. Several chiefs, remembering Rashid rule or calculating future advantage, send word through intermediaries: they will not interfere. Some provide guides familiar with the terrain. No fighters, but no opposition either.\n79-88\nPro-Rashid sentiment. The Rashids' overtures bear fruit. Multiple chiefs declare they welcome the return of the old lords. Some send token forces—a hundred warriors here, fifty there—to join the Rashid contingent. The mountains are friendly.\n89-94\nActive Rashid support. The tribes remember three generations of fair dealing under Rashid rule. Chiefs compete to demonstrate loyalty to the returning lords. Five hundred to a thousand Berber warriors join our march, providing scouts, skirmishers, and mountain guides.\n95-100\nTribal alliance secured. Sheikh Abd al-Rahman's years of quiet diplomacy pay extraordinary dividends. The major Rif chiefs formally recognize Rashid authority over Tétouan and pledge to defend the new emirate against all comers. The mountains that could have been our death become our shield.\n\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty."

Looking at the table:\n\n| 21-30 | **Scattered raids.** Individual chiefs launch opportunistic attacks—a supply wagon captured here, a patrol ambushed there. Annoying and costly in small ways, but no coordinated threat. We must detach troops to guard our lines. |\n\nSo the Rif tribes will conduct scattered raids - not a major threat, but annoying harassment that requires us to divert troops for security.\n\n\nRoll: 21 — Scattered Raids\n\n\n\nThe first attack comes on the second day of the march from Ceuta.\n\n\nA supply wagon at the column's rear—salt pork, hardtack, fodder for the horses—simply vanishes. The guards are found an hour later, throats cut, stripped of weapons and boots. The wagon, the mules, and the supplies are gone, dragged into a ravine that leads up into the hills.\n\n\n\"Rif,\" Don Rodrigo says, studying the tracks. \"A dozen men, maybe fifteen. They knew exactly when to strike—when the rearguard had passed and before the tail escort closed up.\"\n\n\nOver the following days, it continues. A messenger riding alone between units is pulled from his horse by men who emerge from rocks and disappear back into them. A foraging party sent to fill water casks at a stream returns three men short, with arrows in two of the survivors. A night picket is found dead at dawn, his arquebus stolen.\n\n\nNo massed assault. No army descending from the mountains. Just... bleeding. Small cuts that add up.\n\n\nTariq al-Rashid confers with his father's agents who know the region. \"This is not a tribal decision. These are young men—hotheads, glory-seekers, those who want Christian weapons and Christian horses to prove their manhood. The chiefs have not committed.\"\n\n\n\"Can you stop it?\" Don Rodrigo asks bluntly.\n\n\n\"Not entirely. But I can send word through our contacts that those who raid will be remembered when we rule. That may cool some heads.\" Tariq's expression hardens. \"And those we catch, we should hang where the mountains can see. That will cool the rest.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo details two hundred cavalry to patrol the flanks and rear—men who cannot be spared but must be. The march slows slightly as security tightens.\n\n\nBy the time Tétouan's walls come into view, the butcher's bill reads: fourteen dead, twenty-three wounded, two wagons lost, perhaps forty horses and mules taken. Annoying. Costly in small ways. But the army remains intact.\n\n\n\nThree factions assessed:\n\n\nTétouan garrison: Fragmenting, no coordinated defense\n\nFez: Cannot respond, internal crisis\n\nRif tribes: Scattered raids, nuisance but not threat\n\n\nNext: The Rashid Network. Shall I draft the table for how their contacts inside Tétouan perform?"

This could mean:\n- Opening gates\n- Providing intelligence\n- Inciting uprising\n- Sabotaging defenses\n- Or failing to deliver on promises\n\nLet me draft a realistic table considering:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n- Three generations of preparation\n- Strong emotional/family ties to Rashid cause\n- Garrison is already fragmenting (roll 46)\n- The warlord is hated\n- Rashid legitimacy recognized by many in the city\n- Detailed planning and communication\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n- Three generations is a long time - memories fade\n- Al-Wattasi may have purged suspected sympathizers\n- Fear of reprisal if the plot is discovered\n- Contacts may have exaggerated their influence\n- Chaos of fragmenting garrison makes coordination difficult\n- Some may lose nerve at the critical moment\n\n\nTHE RASHID NETWORK — CONTACTS INSIDE TÉTOUAN\n\n\nSITUATION ASSESSMENT\n\n\nThe Network's Position:\n\n\nJunior garrison officer whose grandmother was a Rashid servant—has keys to a minor gate\n\nGuild master with keys to a postern gate in the commercial quarter\n\nUnknown number of sympathizers among the population who remember Rashid rule\n\nThree generations of quiet cultivation, family connections, promises made\n\nThe Rashids travel with the army—their presence is known inside the walls\n\nThe garrison is already fragmenting (Roll 46)—chaos creates opportunity\n\nAl-Wattasi may have attempted to purge suspected traitors in his final desperate days\n\n\nTheir Tasks:\n\n\nOpen gates — The postern, the minor gate, anything that lets our men inside without storming breaches\n\nProvide intelligence — Garrison positions, weak points, al-Wattasi's location\n\nIncite uprising — Rally the population against the usurper when the moment comes\n\nSabotage — Disable defenses, spread panic, prevent coordinated resistance\n\nProtect the city — Guide our forces to resistance pockets while shielding civilians and infrastructure\n\n\nRisks:\n\n\nContacts may have been discovered and executed\n\nThey may have exaggerated their influence\n\nFear may overcome loyalty when the moment arrives\n\nThe chaos of a fragmenting garrison makes coordination difficult\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: RASHID NETWORK PERFORMANCE\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nBetrayal or destruction. Al-Wattasi discovered the network. The contacts are dead—executed publicly as traitors, their families imprisoned or fled. The population is terrorized into silence. No gates open; no intelligence flows. The Rashid name is now associated with failure. We must storm the walls the hard way.\n6-12\nNetwork collapsed. Fear proved stronger than loyalty. When the moment came, the contacts could not act—the guild master claims he lost his keys, the officer says he was watched too closely. Excuses, perhaps true, perhaps cowardice. The network provides nothing of value.\n13-20\nPartial failure. One contact performs; the others fail. The guild master opens his postern gate, but the garrison officer is killed attempting to reach his post. Or vice versa. Limited benefit—one entry point, incomplete intelligence. Better than nothing, but far short of promises.\n21-32\nMinimal performance. The contacts survive and act, but their influence was overstated. A single postern opens, admitting perhaps two hundred men. Some intelligence on garrison positions, but incomplete. The population stays behind closed doors, waiting to see who wins. Helpful, but not decisive.\n33-45\nAdequate performance. The network does what it promised—no more, no less. Two gates open in the night. Intelligence identifies al-Wattasi's location and the strongest resistance points. Some citizens emerge to guide our forces through streets they know. A solid contribution to a faster victory.\n46-60\nGood performance. The contacts exceed expectations. Multiple entry points open simultaneously. Detailed intelligence flows to Don Rodrigo's staff. When our banners rise over the first gate, crowds emerge shouting the Rashid name. The fragmenting garrison loses heart faster. The city falls with less blood than feared.\n61-75\nExcellent coordination. Years of preparation pay off. The network acts as a unified force—gates open, defenders misdirected, fires set in the garrison's barracks to spread confusion. When the Rashid banner rises, the population actively assists, pointing out holdouts and hidden resistance. The siege becomes a liberation.\n76-85\nPopular uprising. The contacts ignite something larger than planned. As our guns prepare to fire, the commercial quarter rises. Shopkeepers, craftsmen, old soldiers who remember better days—they take to the streets with whatever weapons they have. Al-Wattasi's remaining loyalists are overwhelmed from within and without.\n86-93\nCity delivered. The network performs beyond all hopes. Before the first bombardment, word comes: al-Wattasi is dead, killed by his own guards at Rashid instigation. The gates stand open. The garrison's remnants surrender or flee. We march into Tétouan as liberators, not conquerors. Not a Castilian life lost to the walls.\n94-100\nTriumphant restoration. Everything the Rashids promised comes true and more. The city rises as one to welcome the returning lords. Al-Wattasi's body is dragged through the streets. Elders weep with joy. Children throw flowers. The population provides a list of every resistance pocket, every hidden cache, every man who served the usurper with particular cruelty. Tétouan becomes Rashid—and Castilian—with barely a sword drawn.\n\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty."

This is a very good result - the Rashid network performs excellently, with gates opening, defenders misdirected, fires set to spread confusion, and the population actively assisting once Rashid banners rise.\n\nLet me write the narrative for this outcome, keeping it focused and stopping at an appropriate point for the player to act.\n\n\nRoll: 65 — Excellent Coordination\n\n\n\nThe night before the bombardment is scheduled to begin, Tariq al-Rashid comes to the command tent with a messenger—a boy of perhaps fourteen, dusty and exhausted, who slipped out of Tétouan through a drainage culvert.\n\n\n\"It is ready,\" Tariq says, something fierce and bright in his eyes. \"My father's people have been busy.\"\n\n\nThe boy delivers his report in rapid Arabic, which Tariq translates:\n\n\nThe guild master has coordinated with three other merchants. When the signal comes—a fire arrow over the walls at midnight—four gates will open simultaneously. Not the main gates, which are too heavily watched even now, but posterns, service entrances, a water gate by the harbor that has been \"accidentally\" left unbarred.\n\n\nThe junior garrison officer has done more than unlock a door. He has fed Don Rodrigo's staff a complete map of defensive positions—what remains of them. Al-Wattasi has pulled his loyal remnants into the citadel at the city's heart, abandoning the walls entirely. Perhaps six hundred men still obey him. The rest have fled, deserted, or wait in their barracks for someone to tell them the fighting is over.\n\n\nAnd the population has been prepared. Trusted men in each quarter know the Rashid signals. When the banners rise, they will emerge—not to fight, necessarily, but to guide, to point, to say here are the usurper's men and this street is clear and the family in that house served al-Wattasi; the family next door hid Rashid loyalists for years.\n\n\n\"We can take this city with minimal blood,\" Tariq says. \"Yours and ours. But we must move tonight, before al-Wattasi realizes how alone he is and does something desperate.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo studies the map, the intelligence reports, the eager young Rashid lord.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says slowly, \"if this is accurate, we do not need a bombardment. We need a night assault through multiple entry points, converging on the citadel. Fast, coordinated, overwhelming.\" He looks up. \"But if the intelligence is wrong—if those gates do not open—we lose hundreds of men against walls in the dark.\"\n\n\nHe waits for your decision.\n\n\n\nFour factions assessed:\n\n\nTétouan garrison: Fragmenting, six hundred holdouts in citadel\n\nFez: Cannot respond, internal crisis\n\nRif tribes: Scattered raids only\n\nRashid network: Excellent coordination, multiple gates ready, population prepared\n\n\nThe assault plan awaits your command.

This is a significant military action that needs a d100 table to resolve.\n\nLet me consider the factors:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n1. Rashid network performed excellently (Roll 65) - multiple gates ready to open\n2. Garrison fragmenting (Roll 46) - only ~600 holdouts in citadel\n3. No relief from Fez (Roll 81) - internal crisis prevents response\n4. Rif only scattered raids (Roll 21) - no major threat from mountains\n5. 12,000 Castilian troops vs 600 defenders - overwhelming numbers\n6. Population prepared to assist\n7. Detailed intelligence on defensive positions\n8. Night assault achieves surprise\n9. Multiple entry points - defenders can't concentrate\n10. Veteran commanders - Don Rodrigo, academy officers\n11. Rashid fighters (800) know the city, can guide troops\n12. Al-Wattasi has abandoned the walls, pulled into citadel\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n1. Night assaults are inherently chaotic and risky\n2. Urban combat is brutal and unpredictable\n3. Could be a trap - intelligence could be compromised\n4. 600 desperate men in a citadel can still inflict casualties\n5. Friendly fire risk in dark streets with multiple columns converging\n6. Gates might not all open as promised\n7. Al-Wattasi might do something desperate (fire, hostages, etc.)\n8. Unfamiliar terrain for Castilian troops\n9. Some Rif raiders might see opportunity in the chaos\n\nThe balance here is heavily in favor of success given all the previous rolls, but war is chaos and things can still go wrong. The table should reflect that the base case is success, but with variance in how clean that success is.\n\n\nNIGHT ASSAULT ON TÉTOUAN\n\n\nSITUATION SUMMARY\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\nRashid network prepared, four gates ready to open (Roll 65)\n\nGarrison fragmented, only ~600 holdouts in citadel (Roll 46)\n\nNo relief coming from Fez (Roll 81)\n\nRif tribes not massing, only scattered raiders (Roll 21)\n\n12,000 troops against 600 defenders—20-to-1 odds\n\nDetailed intelligence on enemy positions\n\nPopulation prepared to assist with guidance\n\nMultiple simultaneous entry points prevent concentrated defense\n\n800 Rashid fighters who know the streets\n\nVeteran commanders, academy-trained officers throughout\n\n\nRisks:\n\n\nNight assaults are inherently chaotic\n\nUrban combat is brutal even against weak opposition\n\nFriendly fire between converging columns in dark streets\n\nIntelligence could be wrong or compromised\n\nDesperate men in a citadel can still kill\n\nAl-Wattasi might choose spite over survival—fire, hostages, destruction\n\nUnfamiliar terrain for Castilian troops\n\nRif raiders might exploit the confusion\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: NIGHT ASSAULT ON TÉTOUAN\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-3\nCatastrophic betrayal. The network was compromised. Al-Wattasi knew everything. The gates open onto killing grounds—crossbows, burning oil, barricaded streets. Hundreds die in the first minutes. The assault becomes a desperate fighting retreat. The city must be taken by bloody siege after all, with a shattered army and destroyed trust.\n4-8\nDisaster in the dark. The gates open, but chaos reigns. Columns lose their way in unfamiliar streets. Friendly fire claims dozens. A powder store explodes—accident or sabotage. Al-Wattasi's desperate counterattack catches a column in the flank. The city falls, but at terrible cost: 500+ Castilian dead, significant Rashid casualties, much of the commercial quarter burned.\n9-15\nPyrrhic victory. The assault succeeds, but nothing goes smoothly. Gates open late or not at all. Street fighting is brutal. Al-Wattasi sets fires as he retreats to the citadel, destroying warehouses and homes. The citadel requires a bloody storming. Victory, but 300-400 dead, the city damaged, the population traumatized.\n16-25\nCostly success. The plan works, but war is war. Some gates open late; one column takes wrong turns; the citadel garrison fights hard. Al-Wattasi dies sword in hand, taking men with him. The city is taken by dawn with 150-250 Castilian dead and significant damage to the harbor quarter. A victory, but one that bleeds.\n26-40\nHard fighting. The gates open as promised; the columns advance. But 600 desperate men sell their lives dearly. Street by street, house by house, the holdouts are rooted out. The citadel requires an assault, not a surrender. By morning, Tétouan is yours—80-150 dead, wounded twice that, scattered fires, but the city mostly intact.\n41-55\nSolid victory. The assault proceeds largely as planned. Gates open, columns converge, the population guides and assists. Resistance crumbles quarter by quarter. The citadel holdouts, seeing no hope, negotiate surrender at dawn. Al-Wattasi is captured alive. Casualties: 40-80 dead, the city intact, the Rashids installed by noon.\n56-70\nSwift success. The Rashid network performs beautifully. Gates open on signal; the population floods the streets with torches to light the way and fingers pointing to holdouts. Al-Wattasi's men melt away or surrender. The citadel falls within hours, taken from three sides simultaneously. Casualties under 50. The city is barely touched.\n71-82\nTextbook operation. Everything works. The columns move through opened gates like water through channels. Rashid guides lead them unerringly. Resistance collapses on contact. Al-Wattasi is captured trying to flee through a drainage tunnel—the same one the messenger used. Casualties under 30. Don Rodrigo calls it the cleanest urban assault he has ever seen.\n83-90\nOverwhelming triumph. The assault becomes a parade. As Castilian columns enter, the population rises en masse. Holdouts are surrounded and forced to surrender before Castilian steel reaches them. Al-Wattasi's own guards deliver him in chains, hoping for mercy. Casualties under 20—mostly accidents, a few unfortunate encounters. Tétouan falls like a ripe fruit.\n91-96\nBloodless liberation. Word spreads faster than soldiers can march. By the time the columns reach the citadel, it stands open and empty. Al-Wattasi is dead—killed by his own men when they realized the end had come. Castilian casualties: fewer than a dozen, mostly from a collapsed stairway and one unfortunate drowning in the harbor. The city celebrates.\n97-100\nLegendary victory. Songs will be sung of this night. The gates open as one; the people rise with joy; resistance vanishes like morning mist. Al-Wattasi is delivered to the Rashids alive, to face their justice. Not a single Castilian soldier dies in the assault. The army marches through streets lined with cheering crowds, flowers thrown, prayers of thanks raised. Tétouan is reborn under Rashid rule, and every man present will tell his grandchildren he was there.\n\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty."

I should narrate it vividly and then move to the aftermath - the Rashid installation, what happens to al-Wattasi, and what comes next.\n\n\nRoll: 62 — Swift Success\n\n\n\nThe fire arrow arcs over the walls at midnight, a streak of orange against the black sky.\n\n\nFor a heartbeat, nothing. Then—torches flare along the walls, not from defenders but from within. Shouts in Arabic, the grinding of bars lifted, and the postern gates swing open one after another, dark mouths in the stone inviting the army inside.\n\n\n\"Go,\" Don Rodrigo says, and the columns move.\n\n\nYou watch from the command position on a hill overlooking the city as twelve thousand men flow through four entry points like rivers finding channels. The Rashid fighters lead—eight hundred men who have dreamed of this night for three generations, guided by contacts who know every alley, every courtyard, every rooftop where a crossbowman might hide.\n\n\nThe population does more than guide. They flood the streets with torches, turning the dark maze into a lit pathway. Old women point from doorways: that house, the usurper's men are there. Children run ahead of the columns shouting the Rashids have returned! Men emerge with clubs, with knives, with bare hands, surrounding isolated holdouts and holding them until Castilian soldiers arrive.\n\n\nResistance crumbles quarter by quarter. The mercenaries who remained—perhaps four hundred by now, the rest having melted away—find themselves cut off, surrounded, outnumbered beyond any hope. Some fight and die. Most throw down their weapons and kneel, begging mercy in the name of God.\n\n\nBy the time the columns converge on the citadel, it is clear even to the men inside that the end has come. Al-Wattasi stands on the battlements, watching Castilian banners approach from three directions, the Rashid lion flying beside the castle-and-lion of Castile.\n\n\nHe does not set fires. He does not slaughter hostages. Perhaps he considered it; perhaps some shred of honor or calculation restrained him. Instead, as the first scaling ladders touch the citadel walls, the gates open from within. His own captains have decided.\n\n\nAl-Wattasi is dragged out in chains as dawn breaks over Tétouan—a thin man with a grey-streaked beard, eyes burning with impotent fury. He says nothing as he is brought before the Rashid patriarch.\n\n\nSheikh Abd al-Rahman ibn Rashid, eighty years old and trembling with the weight of this moment, looks upon the man who stole his family's city.\n\n\n\"My grandfather built these walls,\" he says quietly. \"My father was born within them. I was meant to die in exile, never seeing home.\" He turns to you. \"Your Majesty, what is your will for this man?\"\n\n\n\nCasualties: Forty-three Castilian dead, perhaps twice that wounded. Most fell in the street fighting before resistance collapsed—a barricade held too long here, an ambush from a rooftop there. The Rashid fighters lost thirty-one of their own. The city itself is barely touched—a few fires quickly extinguished, some looted shops, the inevitable damage of an army passing through. But the walls stand. The harbor is intact. The mosques and markets and homes remain.\n\n\nTétouan has fallen.\n\n\n\nWhat is Juan's will regarding al-Wattasi? And what orders for the city?"

Juan is the conqueror, but the Rashids are meant to rule as vassals\n2. The city is Muslim - the elders will be qadis, merchants, guild masters, religious scholars\n3. The population welcomed the Rashids, but they're also now under Christian rule\n4. Juan needs to establish the relationship clearly - he's the overlord, the Rashids are his vassals who will govern\n\nI should present the scene and then stop when it's time for Juan to speak or make decisions. I shouldn't put words in his mouth.\n\nLet me describe:\n- The palace/dar (probably called a qasbah or similar)\n- Who comes to meet him\n- The atmosphere - cautious hope? fear? calculation?\n- The Rashids present as well\n- Don Rodrigo and other commanders\n\nThen stop and let the player decide what to say/do.\n\n\nThe Dar al-Makhzen—the House of Government—stands at the city's heart, a sprawling complex of whitewashed walls, tiled courtyards, and cool arcades built by Rashid ancestors two centuries past. Al-Wattasi made it his seat; now it serves a different purpose.\n\n\nYou enter through the main gate as the morning sun climbs over the eastern hills. Don Rodrigo has secured the building—Castilian soldiers stand at every entrance, professional and watchful, but under strict orders to offer no insult to those who come in peace. The Rashid banner flies beside the Castilian standard over the gatehouse. The message is clear: dual authority, shared victory.\n\n\nThe great hall is a rectangle of carved cedar and zellige tilework, light filtering through latticed windows. At its far end, a raised dais where al-Wattasi held court. You take your place there, Don Rodrigo at your right hand, Sheikh Abd al-Rahman and his sons at your left. Behind you stand your officers; before you, the people of Tétouan.\n\n\nThey come in cautious procession, guided by Rashid intermediaries who know who matters.\n\n\nThe Qadi—the city's chief judge, an elderly man named Abu Abdullah al-Fasi, who administered Islamic law even under al-Wattasi's arbitrary rule. He walks with a cane, his white beard reaching his chest, his eyes sharp and measuring. He has survived three changes of power. He intends to survive this one.\n\n\nThe Guild Masters—a dozen men representing the trades that make Tétouan function: weavers, metalworkers, leatherworkers, shipwrights, merchants. One of them, a stout man with ink-stained fingers, is the guild master who opened the postern gate. He stands a little straighter than the others.\n\n\nThe Port Captain—a weathered sailor named Yusef ibn Musa, who controls the harbor pilots and knows every ship that enters or leaves. Without his cooperation, the port is useless.\n\n\nThe Market Sheikh—the man who oversees the great souk, collects fees, settles disputes among merchants. He represents the commercial heart of the city.\n\n\nReligious Scholars—three men from the city's mosques and madrasas, watching with particular intensity. They will determine whether the faithful accept this new order or resist it in their hearts.\n\n\nProminent Families—a handful of men whose names mean nothing to you but everything here. Old bloodlines, old money, old obligations. They have survived Marinids, Wattasids, al-Wattasi. They will survive this too, if they can.\n\n\nAnd behind them, visible through the open doors, a crowd gathers in the courtyard—common people straining to see, to hear, to understand what manner of man now holds their fate.\n\n\nSheikh Abd al-Rahman leans close and murmurs: \"They are afraid, Your Majesty. Afraid and hopeful. What you say now will be repeated in every home, every mosque, every market stall before sunset. Choose your words as carefully as you once chose them for my family.\"\n\n\nThe hall falls silent. All eyes turn to you."

      "say": "Thought process: Consulted skill documentation to construct persuasion-based encounter table.\n\nThe player wants me to use the persuasion skill to draft a d100 table for Juan's speech to the people of Tétouan. I need to read the persuasion skill document first to follow the proper procedure.\n\n\nView: Reading the persuasion skill to draft the d100 table properly\n\n\nThought process: Evaluated persuasion approach against success and failure factors comprehensively.\n\nNow I need to evaluate this persuasion attempt according to the skill.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Ask**\nJuan is addressing the conquered population of Tétouan, asking them to accept:\n1. Castilian suzerainty over their city\n2. Rashid rule under Castilian protection\n3. Peaceful coexistence between Christians and Muslims\n4. An end to raiding and the beginning of trade\n\nThis is essentially asking the population to accept the new political reality peacefully.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Player's Approach**\n\nJuan's speech:\n- Addressed them in Arabic (respectful, culturally appropriate)\n- Opened with \"Salaam\" (Islamic greeting - shows respect)\n- Emphasized restoration rather than conquest (\"restore what was lost\")\n- Made clear he's installing a Muslim ruler (the Rashids), not direct Christian rule\n- Promised an end to raiding (both ways) and trade instead\n- Promised law and justice\n- Promised security (reinforced walls against Rif)\n- Explicitly acknowledged religious difference while promising mutual respect\n- Framed this as mutual benefit (\"much we can learn from one another\")\n\nThis is a STRONG approach. Juan has:\n- Shown cultural respect\n- Provided face-saving (this is a \"restoration\" not a conquest)\n- Promised tangible benefits (trade, security, law)\n- Left their religious identity intact\n- Installed a Muslim ruler rather than direct rule\n\n**Step 3: Identify All Factors**\n\n**Success Factors:**\n1. Al-Wattasi was hated - they're not mourning him\n2. The Rashids have historical legitimacy - their ancestors ruled fairly\n3. The assault was swift and relatively bloodless (Roll 62)\n4. The population actively assisted - many already committed to this outcome\n5. Juan speaks Arabic - shows respect and intelligence\n6. He's installing Muslim rulers, not direct Christian rule\n7. He promises trade instead of raiding - economic benefit\n\n\n8. The city gains protection against Rif threats while maintaining its walls\n9. Stability and proper governance replace years of tyranny and arbitrary rule\n10. The old regime's military collapsed (Roll 46) - no viable resistance remains\n11. Religious practice continues unimpeded under the new arrangement\n12. The tone is measured and respectful rather than boastful about victory\n13. Fez cannot intervene (Roll 81) - the population has no external savior\n14. The Rashid supporters are already embedded in the city (Roll 65) - they have local backing\n\nHowever, fundamental obstacles remain. A Christian conqueror ruling Muslim lands creates an inherent legitimacy problem that no speech can fully overcome. Religious scholars may view this arrangement as capitulation, and some will reject infidel authority regardless of the terms offered. Those who benefited under the previous regime fear consequences, while locals worry about retaliation for suspected collaboration with the assault. Trust cannot be manufactured through promises alone—it develops slowly. Even benevolent foreign rule still represents lost independence, and some will maintain genuine religious objections to Muslim rulers serving Christian masters.\n\nThe success factors substantially outweigh the obstacles here. The population already participated in the takeover, the previous government was thoroughly despised, and the new rulers possess legitimate Islamic credentials with generous terms. Yet the religious and identity concerns will linger regardless of how well things proceed—the question becomes whether enough people can move past these reservations.\n\n\nPERSUASION: ADDRESSING THE PEOPLE OF TÉTOUAN\n\n\nStep 1: The Ask\n\n\nJuan asks the conquered population to:\n\n\nAccept Castilian suzerainty and Rashid rule\n\nEmbrace peaceful coexistence between Christian overlord and Muslim subjects\n\nBelieve in promises of trade, security, law, and religious respect\n\nCommit to the new order with genuine acceptance, not sullen submission\n\n\n\nStep 2: Approach Evaluation\n\n\nWhat Juan did well:\n\n\nSpoke in Arabic—exceptional cultural respect, shows intelligence and preparation\n\nOpened with \"Salaam\"—the Islamic greeting of peace\n\nFramed this as restoration, not conquest—face-saving for the population\n\nEmphasized installing Muslim rulers, not direct Christian rule\n\nPromised concrete benefits: trade instead of raiding, reinforced walls, law and justice\n\nExplicitly acknowledged religious difference while promising mutual respect\n\nTone was humble and forward-looking, not triumphalist\n\n\"Much we can learn from one another\"—positions this as partnership, not subjugation\n\n\nWhat could be stronger:\n\n\nNo specific mention of how religious institutions (mosques, scholars, waqf endowments) will be protected\n\nNo explicit guarantee against reprisals for those who served al-Wattasi\n\nNo mention of how disputes between Muslims and Christians will be adjudicated\n\n\nOverall approach quality: STRONG. Juan has crafted a speech that respects identity, offers tangible benefits, and provides face-saving. This is close to optimal for the situation.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Factor Identification\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nAl-Wattasi was hated—the population helped overthrow him\n\nThe Rashids have historical legitimacy—their ancestors ruled justly\n\nThe assault was swift and merciful (Roll 62)—the city is intact, casualties minimal\n\nThe population already committed—they guided Castilian soldiers, pointed out holdouts\n\nJuan speaks Arabic—extraordinary respect rarely shown by Christian rulers\n\nMuslim rulers installed, not direct Christian governance\n\nTrade promised instead of raiding—economic benefit to merchants\n\nSecurity against Rif promised—protection the old regime couldn't provide\n\nLaw and justice promised—stability after tyranny\n\nThe garrison fragmented (Roll 46)—the old regime thoroughly discredited\n\nReligious freedom explicitly guaranteed\n\n\"Salaam\" opening—Islamic greeting shows genuine respect\n\nFez cannot intervene (Roll 81)—no alternative exists\n\nThe Rashid network performed excellently (Roll 65)—their supporters already legitimized\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nChristian conqueror on Muslim soil—fundamental identity issue that no speech erases\n\nReligious scholars' concerns—some will see any accommodation as betrayal of faith\n\nThose who profited under al-Wattasi—fear retribution despite no explicit threat\n\nWords are cheap—trust must be earned over time, not in one speech\n\nLoss of independence—even to \"friendly\" overlords remains a loss\n\nSome will never accept—a core of religious/political hardliners exists in any population\n\n\n\nStep 4: Factor Balance Assessment\n\n\nHeavily weighted toward success. The population actively participated in their own \"liberation.\" The old regime was despised. The new rulers are Muslim with legitimate claims. The terms are generous. The speech is well-crafted.\n\n\nHowever, identity and religious concerns persist even at the highest rolls. Complete, universal acceptance is impossible. The question is: how enthusiastic is the acceptance, and how marginal are the holdouts?\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: RECEPTION OF JUAN'S ADDRESS\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nHostile rejection. A religious scholar interrupts, denouncing accommodation with infidels. His words find purchase—the crowd's mood turns ugly. The elders remain silent rather than defend the new order. The ceremony ends in tension. Acceptance is sullen at best; resistance will simmer. The Rashids must work hard to overcome this inauspicious beginning.\n6-12\nCold reception. The speech is heard in silence. No one objects openly, but no one responds either. The elders offer formulaic courtesies and depart quickly. The population accepts reality but offers nothing more. Trust will be slow to build. The Rashids face an uphill struggle to win genuine loyalty.\n13-20\nCautious acceptance. The elders respond with careful, noncommittal words—praising peace, thanking God for deliverance from tyranny, saying nothing about Juan or Castile specifically. The population watches and waits. They will judge by deeds, not words. A fair start, but only a start.\n21-35\nQualified acceptance. The qadi speaks for the elders, acknowledging the justice of Rashid restoration and the mercy shown to the city. He carefully avoids endorsing Christian overlordship but does not oppose it. The guild masters nod approval at promises of trade. The religious scholars remain pointedly silent. A workable foundation.\n36-50\nRespectful reception. Juan's Arabic and cultural sensitivity visibly impress the assembly. The guild master who opened the postern gate speaks warmly of promises kept. The qadi offers a prayer for peace. Most of the crowd disperses with hopeful murmurs. A few hardliners scowl, but they are isolated. The new order has legitimacy.\n51-65\nWarm acceptance. The elders respond with genuine warmth—the qadi praises Juan's wisdom and mercy; the guild masters speak eagerly of trade opportunities; even the religious scholars offer cautious approval for the guarantee of religious freedom. The crowd outside cheers when the Rashid banner rises beside Castile's. A strong beginning.\n66-78\nEnthusiastic reception. Juan's words strike exactly the right notes. The port captain pledges cooperation; the market sheikh speaks of prosperity to come; the qadi calls this \"a day of restoration, not conquest.\" The crowd presses forward to see the Christian king who speaks their tongue and shows their faith respect. The Rashids beam with vindication.\n79-88\nProfound impact. The assembly is moved. An elderly scholar—voice trembling—says he never thought he would live to see a Christian king speak thus. The guild masters offer immediate practical cooperation. The religious scholars, after conferring, issue a statement: this arrangement violates no principle of faith. The population embraces the new order with relief and hope.\n89-95\nTransformative moment. Juan's speech becomes the story everyone tells. \"He spoke Arabic. He said Salaam. He promised we could learn from each other.\" The elders compete to offer loyalty; the crowd outside begins chanting Rashid praises mixed with acknowledgment of Juan's justice. Even skeptics admit: this is not what they expected from a Christian conqueror.\n96-100\nLegendary address. For generations, this speech will be remembered—the day a Christian king stood in the Dar al-Makhzen, spoke the people's tongue, and offered partnership instead of subjugation. The qadi weeps openly. The religious scholars declare this a sign of God's mercy. The crowd erupts in celebration. Tétouan becomes not merely Rashid territory but a symbol of what Christian-Muslim cooperation might achieve.\n\n\nNote on Failure Factor Persistence:\n\n\nEven at the highest rolls, some religious hardliners will disapprove. Some will never accept Christian suzerainty. These voices will be marginalized, not eliminated. The difference between a low roll and a high roll is whether these voices find an audience or speak into emptiness.\n\n\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty."

The guild master who opened the postern gate speaks warmly of promises kept. The qadi offers a prayer for peace. Most of the crowd disperses with hopeful murmurs. A few hardliners scowl, but they are isolated. The new order has legitimacy.\n\nThis is a solid, workable result - not spectacular but genuinely positive. The population is impressed and hopeful, but trust must still be earned through deeds. Let me narrate this.\n\n\nRoll: 50 — Respectful Reception\n\n\n\nThe hall stills as your Arabic fills the space.\n\n\nYou see it in their faces—the flicker of surprise, the recalculation. They expected Latin commands through interpreters, the arrogance of conquerors who do not deign to learn the tongues of the conquered. Instead: Salaam. The greeting of peace, spoken with an accent that marks you as foreign but with pronunciation that shows you learned it properly, from someone who cared that you learned it right.\n\n\nThe qadi, Abu Abdullah al-Fasi, studies you with those sharp old eyes throughout. When you finish, the silence stretches for three heartbeats. Four.\n\n\nThen he steps forward, leaning on his cane, and speaks in a voice that carries to the courtyard beyond.\n\n\n\"We have lived under tyranny. We have seen justice become a word without meaning, law become the whim of whoever held the sword that day. Now a Christian king stands in this hall and speaks of restoration, of trade, of walls strengthened against those who would raid us.\" He pauses, letting the words settle. \"These are words. Words are wind.\"\n\n\nA murmur runs through the assembly. Some of the guild masters shift uncomfortably.\n\n\n\"But,\" the qadi continues, raising one gnarled finger, \"I have lived eighty-three years. I have learned to hear what lies beneath words. This king did not need to learn our tongue. He did not need to speak of what we might teach one another. He did not need to place Sheikh Abd al-Rahman beside him as an equal, when he might have ruled through a puppet as others have done.\"\n\n\nHe turns to face the assembly fully.\n\n\n\"I do not ask you to love this arrangement. I do not ask you to forget that foreign soldiers walk our streets. I ask only that you judge by what comes next. If the walls are strengthened—we will see. If trade flows and raiders fear to strike—we will see. If the law is restored and justice means something again—we will see.\"\n\n\nHe faces you once more and bows, stiffly but correctly.\n\n\n\"May God guide your hand, King of Castile. May He grant you wisdom to keep the promises you have made. And may He grant us patience to wait and see if you are the man your words suggest.\"\n\n\nHe steps back. The guild master who opened the postern gate—the stout man with ink-stained fingers—moves forward. His voice is rougher, more practical.\n\n\n\"The port needs dredging. Al-Wattasi took the fees and spent nothing on maintenance. If Your Majesty means what he says about trade, we will need investment. I have lists. Costs. Proposals.\" He glances at the Rashids. \"Sheikh Abd al-Rahman's grandfather understood that a port is like a garden—it must be tended or it dies.\"\n\n\nA few of the other guild masters nod. Commerce they understand. Commerce they can believe in.\n\n\nThe religious scholars remain silent—not hostile, but watchful. They will render no judgment today. One of them, a younger man with a close-trimmed beard, catches your eye for a moment. His expression is unreadable. He looks away.\n\n\nIn the courtyard, the crowd begins to disperse. The murmurs you catch are mixed: curiosity, hope, skepticism, the resigned pragmatism of people who have survived worse. A few voices mutter darkly about infidels and accommodation, but they are hushed by their neighbors.\n\n\nSheikh Abd al-Rahman leans close as the hall begins to empty.\n\n\n\"Better than I feared. Worse than I hoped.\" His voice is quiet, for you alone. \"The qadi has given us permission to prove ourselves. That is more than many conquerors receive. Now we must deliver.\"\n\n\nTariq adds: \"The scholars worry me. They said nothing—which means they are waiting to see which way the wind blows. If we stumble, they will be the first to preach against us.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo, who understood nothing of the Arabic but read the room well enough, offers his own assessment: \"They're not reaching for knives. That's a start. The rest is administration—walls, trade, law. Things we can actually do.\"\n\n\n\nThe ceremony concludes. Tétouan has accepted its new order—cautiously, conditionally, with eyes open and judgment reserved.\n\n\nWhat are Juan's orders for the city? And what of al-Wattasi, still in chains, awaiting his fate?"

This is an important moment - the culmination of years of planning and the beginning of a new chapter.\n\nLet me think about Sheikh Abd al-Rahman's character:\n- He's about 80 years old\n- His family was exiled from Tétouan three generations ago\n- He's lived his entire life dreaming of restoration\n- He's pragmatic enough to ally with a Christian king to achieve it\n- He has four sons: Khalid (finances), Tariq (military), Yusuf (legal/religious), Omar (young and eager)\n- He just witnessed his life's dream come true\n\nThis is not a persuasion moment - Juan is not asking for anything the Sheikh would refuse. This is a conversation between allies, a moment of shared triumph and planning for the future.\n\nThe Sheikh should be:\n1. Genuinely grateful but not sycophantic\n2. Realistic about the challenges ahead\n3. Thinking about legacy - he's 80, he won't rule for long\n4. Concerned about his sons and their readiness\n5. Aware that the arrangement with Castile is the foundation of their power\n\nI should write this as a warm but substantive conversation between two men who have achieved something together and must now think about what comes next.\n\n\nThe evening call to prayer echoes across the city as you find a quiet courtyard in the Dar al-Makhzen—a small garden with a fountain at its center, orange trees heavy with fruit, the scent of jasmine in the cooling air. Sheikh Abd al-Rahman lowers himself onto a stone bench with the careful movements of a man whose body has outlived its easy years. A servant brings tea, then withdraws.\n\n\nFor a long moment, the old man simply breathes. His eyes are distant, fixed on something beyond the whitewashed walls.\n\n\n\"Three generations,\" he says finally. His Arabic is cultured, precise—the speech of a man raised to rule, even in exile. \"My grandfather died cursing the men who stole this city. My father died praying he might one day return. I thought I would die the same way—an old man in Granada, telling stories of a home I barely remembered, watching my sons grow up as guests in another man's kingdom.\"\n\n\nHe turns to face you, and there are tears on his weathered cheeks. He does not wipe them away.\n\n\n\"And now I sit in my grandfather's garden, and the fountain still sings the same song it sang when he was young.\" A fragile smile. \"You ask what is next. What is next is that I will die here, Your Majesty. In my home. That is more than I ever dared to hope.\"\n\n\nHe accepts a cup of tea, wrapping his hands around it though the evening is not cold.\n\n\n\"Rule?\" He shakes his head slowly. \"I am eighty years old. I can barely climb stairs. I will sit in this garden and give advice that my sons may ignore, and I will pray, and I will watch my grandchildren play where my grandfather played. That is enough. That is more than enough.\"\n\n\nHe sips the tea, then sets it aside.\n\n\n\"Tariq will hold the military command—he has the mind for it, and the respect of the fighters who followed us here. Khalid will manage the treasury and the port; he understands money as I never did. Yusuf will handle the law, the scholars, the religious questions—he has spent twenty years studying fiqh and knows how to speak to men who think agreement with Christians is apostasy.\" A slight grimace. \"That will be the hardest work. Harder than walls or trade.\"\n\n\n\"And Omar?\" you ask.\n\n\nThe old man's expression softens. \"Omar is young. Eager. He wants glory and has not yet learned that glory is mostly surviving long enough to grow old.\" A pause. \"I will find something for him that feels important but cannot get him killed. Perhaps liaison to your court—he admired you even before today, you know. The way you spoke to us in Granada, the way you treated us as men with honor rather than beggars seeking scraps.\"\n\n\nHe straightens slightly, and something of the leader he once might have been shows through the aged frame.\n\n\n\"You asked what is next. I will tell you what I see.\"\n\n\nHe holds up one finger. \"First, we must survive the next year. The Rif chiefs are watching. If we seem weak, they will test us. Your walls and your promise of reinforcement—these matter more than you know. The first time raiders come and find Castilian ships in the harbor, word will spread. After that, fewer will try.\"\n\n\nA second finger. \"Second, we must prove the scholars wrong—or at least, not prove them right. They fear that accommodation with Christians means corruption of the faith. Every mosque must remain open. Every call to prayer must sound. Every qadi must judge by Islamic law. If a Christian soldier insults a Muslim woman or desecrates a holy place, the punishment must be swift and visible. One incident mishandled, and the scholars will have their proof.\"\n\n\nA third finger. \"Third, trade. The guild masters are already calculating profits. If the port thrives, if merchants grow wealthy, if Tétouan becomes what it was before the chaos—a gate between Africa and Europe—then men will defend this arrangement with their purses, which is more reliable than defending it with their hearts.\"\n\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\n\"And fourth... your promises, Your Majesty. You spoke of what we might learn from one another. That was well said—perhaps the best thing you said. But it must become real. Scholars who visit Castile and return with respect. Merchants who trade fairly and find partners, not exploitation. Soldiers who protect rather than pillage.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes directly.\n\n\n\"I believe you meant what you said. I would not have brought my family across the sea for a man I did not trust. But I am old, and I have seen many promises. I have also seen what happens when the man who made the promise dies, and his heir feels no obligation to honor it.\"\n\n\nA careful pause.\n\n\n\"What happens to Tétouan when you are gone, King Juan? What binds your successors to the words you spoke today?\""

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed extraordinary interfaith persuasion through vulnerability and theological authenticity.\n\nThis is a profoundly significant moment. Juan, a Christian king, has just recited Al-Fatiha (the opening chapter of the Quran) in Arabic to an elderly Muslim sheikh, and then offered a prayer for Christian-Muslim brotherhood. This is an extraordinary act of religious bridge-building that would be almost unthinkable in the 15th century.\n\nLet me work through the persuasion skill carefully.\n\n## Step 1: The Ask\n\nWhat is Juan actually asking for here? This is subtle. He's not asking for anything material. He's:\n1. Sharing a deeply personal spiritual vision\n2. Inviting Sheikh Abd al-Rahman into an intimate moment of interfaith communion\n3. Seeking validation/acceptance of his vision of Christian-Muslim brotherhood\n4. Building a bond of trust that transcends the political arrangement\n5. Revealing a part of himself that could be used against him (a Christian king who prays Muslim prayers could be accused of apostasy or heresy)\n\nThe \"ask\" is essentially: \"Accept me as a spiritual brother, not just a political ally. Share my vision of what could be.\"\n\n## Step 2: Approach Evaluation\n\n**What Juan did exceptionally well:**\n- Recited Al-Fatiha correctly in Arabic - this is the most sacred prayer in Islam, recited in every ritual prayer\n- Knelt in a posture of humility and devotion\n- Framed it as a shared moment, not a performance\n- The theological framing is careful: \"Allah and Jehova are one and the same\" - this is actually compatible with Islamic theology, which holds that Jews and Christians received earlier revelations from the same God\n- Added a personal prayer that acknowledges suffering, difference, and hope for peace\n- \"Inshallah\" - God willing - the proper Islamic phrase\n- This is incredibly vulnerable - a Christian king could be accused of heresy for this\n- The privacy of the moment shows this is genuine, not political theater\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- A devout Muslim might see this as appropriation or misunderstanding of Islam\n\n\n- Some could view a Christian reciting the Quran as improper, and the theological claim of shared divinity, while accepted in Islam, remains controversial within Christian doctrine\n- There's a risk this could appear naive or even manipulative if the sheikh approaches it with cynicism\n\n**Overall approach quality: EXTRAORDINARY.** This transcends political calculation—it's a genuine spiritual offering that exposes Juan's deepest convictions and leaves him exposed to serious accusations of heresy.\n\n## Step 3: Factor Identification\n\n**Success Factors:**\n1. Flawless recitation of Al-Fatiha demonstrates genuine knowledge and respect for Islamic practice\n2. The vulnerability Juan displays by risking his reputation creates authenticity that's difficult to dismiss\n3. The private setting and personal prayer show this isn't performative politics\n4. Islamic theology actually permits Christians as \"People of the Book\" to share in monotheistic faith\n5. The moment arrives when emotions run highest—gratitude and restoration are fresh\n6. An 80-year-old sheikh has developed instincts for detecting genuine faith versus manipulation\n7. Juan's physical submission through kneeling represents extraordinary humility from someone of his station\n8. The closing \"Inshallah\" and proper Arabic demonstrate real understanding, not mere recitation\n9. Juan directly answers the sheikh's earlier question about what binds successors—shared faith becomes the answer\n10. The sheikh's survival has depended on reading character accurately; he'll recognize sincerity\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n1. **Religious boundaries persist** - even the most progressive Muslim scholar maintains theological limits around Christian participation in Islamic prayer\n2. **Al-Fatiha carries sacred weight** - some view a Christian reciting it as overstepping or even disrespectful\n3. **Political motives could be suspected** - the sheikh might question whether this displays genuine faith or calculated strategy\n4. **Fundamental theological gaps remain** - Trinity, Jesus's nature, and other core doctrines create unbridgeable differences\n5. **The sheikh's credibility with religious authorities matters** - appearing too accepting of Christian theology could damage his standing\n6. **Caution after restoration** - having just reclaimed his homeland, the sheikh may resist anything that threatens stability\n\nThe success here isn't about theological merger. The sheikh can recognize Juan's sincerity and acknowledge the Islamic concept of People of the Book while still maintaining clear religious boundaries. He can share the vision of peace without pretending fundamental differences don't exist.\n\nWhat matters is whether this moment creates a personal, spiritual connection—one he keeps private—that changes how he sees Juan as an individual, distinct from any Christian ruler he's encountered before. The real question becomes how moved he is and what form his response takes.\n\n\nPERSUASION: A PRAYER BETWEEN FAITHS\n\n\nStep 1: The Ask\n\n\nThis is not a political request. Juan asks for something far more profound:\n\n\nShare a vision of spiritual brotherhood across the religious divide\n\nAccept this moment of interfaith communion as genuine, not manipulation\n\nSee Juan not merely as overlord or ally, but as a fellow seeker of God\n\nKeep this confidence—a Christian king reciting Al-Fatiha could be destroyed by this knowledge in the wrong hands\n\n\nStep 2: Approach Evaluation\n\n\nWhat Juan did:\n\n\nRecited Al-Fatiha—the opening surah of the Quran, the most sacred prayer in Islam, recited in every salat\n\nRecited it correctly, in Arabic, from memory\n\nKnelt in a posture of submission to God—remarkable humility for a king\n\nFramed the theological point carefully: Allah and Jehovah as one God—a position actually compatible with Islamic doctrine regarding Ahl al-Kitab (People of the Book)\n\nAdded a personal prayer acknowledging suffering, difference, and hope\n\nClosed with \"Inshallah\"—the proper Islamic invocation\n\nDid this in absolute privacy—not performance, but intimacy\n\nMade himself profoundly vulnerable—this knowledge could be used to destroy him\n\n\nApproach quality: EXTRAORDINARY. This transcends persuasion technique. This is a genuine act of spiritual courage and vulnerability that no political calculation would suggest. Juan has revealed something true about himself that he has likely never shared with anyone.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Factor Identification\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nAl-Fatiha recited correctly—shows years of genuine study, not superficial gesture\n\nArabic fluency already established respect; this deepens it immeasurably\n\nComplete privacy—no witnesses, no political benefit, only trust\n\nProfound vulnerability—Juan hands the sheikh a weapon that could destroy him\n\nTheological framing is actually sound in Islamic doctrine—Christians and Jews worship the same God, though imperfectly\n\nSheikh is eighty years old—has seen enough false piety to recognize the real thing\n\nThe restoration just happened—emotions are raw, gratitude is deep\n\nSheikh already expressed trust: \"I would not have brought my family across the sea for a man I did not trust\"\n\nThe added prayer is beautiful, acknowledging suffering and hope without pretending differences don't exist\n\nJuan knelt—a Christian king kneeling to pray as Muslims pray\n\nSheikh asked what binds successors—Juan answers with something deeper than treaties\n\nThe sheikh survived decades reading men's hearts; he will know sincerity\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nTheological boundaries are real—Islam and Christianity have genuine, unbridgeable differences (Trinity, divinity of Christ, finality of Muhammad's prophecy)\n\nAl-Fatiha is sacred—some Muslims would consider a Christian reciting it presumptuous or improper\n\nThe dream is impossible—centuries of blood, crusade and jihad, cannot be undone by one prayer\n\nSheikh's position requires caution—if he endorses this too fully, the religious scholars will call him apostate\n\nSuspicion of manipulation—however sincere this seems, the sheikh has survived by doubting\n\nIslamic doctrine is clear—Christians are respected as People of the Book, but they are still in error; full \"brotherhood\" implies theological equality that Islam cannot grant\n\n\n\nStep 4: Factor Balance Assessment\n\n\nThis is not a negotiation. This is a moment of spiritual intimacy between two old men—one who has seen too much, one who dreams of something that may be impossible.\n\n\nThe sheikh cannot say \"yes, we are brothers in faith\"—that would violate Islamic theology and destroy his credibility. But he can:\n\n\nRecognize Juan's sincerity and be moved by it\n\nAcknowledge the Islamic teaching that Christians worship the same God, though imperfectly\n\nShare the dream of peace while acknowledging its difficulty\n\nHonor this moment as sacred between them\n\nSee Juan as something unprecedented—a Christian ruler who genuinely seeks understanding\n\n\nThe roll determines how deeply this moment affects him, and how he responds to Juan's extraordinary vulnerability.\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: THE SHEIKH'S RESPONSE\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nTheological rejection. The sheikh stiffens. However well-intentioned, a Christian reciting Al-Fatiha crosses a line. \"You honor me with your sincerity, Your Majesty. But this...\" He shakes his head. \"The prayer is not yours to pray. We are allies, perhaps even friends. But we are not brothers in faith. We cannot be.\" The moment breaks. Trust remains, but a wall has risen.\n6-12\nGentle correction. The sheikh is moved but troubled. \"Your heart is good, King Juan. Better than most. But you do not understand what you are asking. Islam teaches that Christians are People of the Book—but also that you have strayed from the true path. I cannot pretend otherwise, even for you.\" He offers respect, but not the communion Juan sought.\n13-20\nCautious appreciation. The sheikh sits in silence for a long moment. \"I have never seen a Christian do what you have done. I do not know what to make of it.\" He does not reject, but neither does he embrace. \"Let us speak of this no more. What passed here stays here. That much I can promise.\" The door remains closed, but not locked.\n21-35\nRespectful distance. \"You dream a beautiful dream, Your Majesty.\" The sheikh's voice is soft, sad. \"I have dreamed it too, in my weaker moments. But the scholars would call us both fools—or worse.\" He reaches out and touches Juan's shoulder briefly. \"Keep your dream. But keep it quiet. The world is not ready. Perhaps it never will be.\"\n36-50\nQuiet acknowledgment. The sheikh is silent for a very long time. When he speaks, his voice is rough. \"My grandfather taught me Al-Fatiha. His father taught him. And now I hear it from a Christian king, spoken as it should be spoken.\" He does not say they are brothers. He does not say the dream is possible. But something in his eyes has shifted. \"I will remember this night.\"\n51-65\nMoved beyond words. The sheikh's hands tremble around his tea cup. He sets it down carefully. \"In eighty years, I have never...\" He stops. Starts again. \"The scholars say Christians are astray. Perhaps. But if you are astray, you are searching for the same light we seek.\" He meets Juan's eyes. \"I cannot call you brother in faith. But I can call you brother in hope. Is that enough?\"\n66-78\nSpiritual recognition. Tears slip down the old man's face. He does not wipe them away. \"Do you know what you have done? Do you understand the risk?\" His voice is barely a whisper. \"If the wrong person heard what you just prayed, your own Church would destroy you. And you shared it with me—a Muslim, a stranger, a man you met two years ago.\" He reaches out, takes Juan's hands in his. \"This secret dies with me. And I will carry it as a treasure.\"\n79-88\nProfound connection. The sheikh rises—slowly, painfully—and then, to Juan's astonishment, kneels beside him on the cold stone. \"I am too old to kneel. My sons will scold me tomorrow.\" His voice shakes. \"But if a Christian king can kneel to pray as we pray, then I can kneel beside him.\" He closes his eyes. \"You asked me to live in your world for a moment. I am living in it now. It is... beautiful. And terrible. Because it cannot last.\"\n89-95\nSacred bond. The old man weeps openly. He takes Juan's face in his hands—an intimacy that would be unthinkable in any other moment—and presses his forehead to Juan's. \"My son. My brother. My king.\" The words come in Arabic, broken with sobs. \"God sees what you have done here. I believe this. Whatever the scholars say, whatever the priests say—God sees.\" He pulls back, composing himself with effort. \"When I die, I will tell Him: I knew one Christian who understood.\"\n96-100\nTransformative moment. For a long moment, the sheikh cannot speak at all. Then, slowly, he begins to recite—not Al-Fatiha, but another verse, one Juan recognizes: \"Say: O People of the Book, come to a word common between us and you—that we worship none but God, and associate nothing with Him, and take not one another as lords apart from God.\" The Quran's own call for unity among believers. \"I have waited my whole life to meet someone I could say this to,\" the sheikh whispers. \"And God sent me a Christian king.\" He grips Juan's hands with surprising strength. \"Whatever happens—whatever comes—remember this night. And know that one old man will pray for you until his last breath.\"\n\n\nNote on Failure Factor Persistence:\n\n\nEven at the highest rolls, the sheikh cannot declare theological unity between Islam and Christianity—the differences are real and cannot be wished away. What changes is the personal bond between these two men, and the depth of spiritual recognition between them. The sheikh can honor Juan's sincerity, share his hope for peace, and treasure this moment as sacred—while still acknowledging that the dream of full brotherhood faces obstacles neither of them can overcome.\n\n\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty."

The sheikh is profoundly affected by what Juan has done - a Christian king kneeling to recite Al-Fatiha in private, making himself utterly vulnerable. The roll indicates tears, recognition of Juan's courage and risk, and a commitment to keep this secret as a treasure.\n\nI need to write this with the emotional weight it deserves, while respecting that the sheikh cannot cross theological lines. He can recognize Juan's sincerity, honor the moment as sacred between them, and commit to this bond - but he cannot say \"yes, we are brothers in the same faith\" because that would violate Islamic doctrine.\n\nThe key elements from the table:\n- Tears on the old man's face\n- Recognition of the risk Juan has taken\n- \"If the wrong person heard what you just prayed, your own Church would destroy you\"\n- \"And you shared it with me—a Muslim, a stranger, a man you met two years ago\"\n- He takes Juan's hands in his\n- \"This secret dies with me.

His eyes remain fixed on you—kneeling there on the stone, hands still folded, a Christian king who has just prayed the opening of the Holy Quran in a garden in Africa.\n\n\nWhen he finally speaks, his voice is barely audible above the fountain.\n\n\n\"Do you know what you have done?\"\n\n\nHe sets down his tea cup. His hands are trembling. Not the tremor of age—something else.\n\n\n\"Do you understand the risk?\"\n\n\nTears slip down the weathered channels of his face. He makes no move to wipe them away.\n\n\n\"If the wrong person heard what you just prayed—if even one servant was listening beyond that wall—your own Church would destroy you. The Inquisition. The bishops. The Pope himself.\" His voice cracks. \"They would call you apostate. Heretic. They would say the devil had taken your soul. Everything you have built, everything you have fought for—gone. Your children's inheritance. Your legacy. Your life.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward, and the movement costs him—you can see the pain in his joints, the effort it takes.\n\n\n\"And you shared it with me. A Muslim. A stranger. A man you met two years ago in a garden in Granada, begging for scraps of hope.\"\n\n\nHe reaches out and takes your hands in his. His grip is surprisingly strong, the calluses of a man who once rode and fought, before age stole those abilities.\n\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\nThe question is raw. Unguarded. The question of a man who has spent eighty years learning to distrust, suddenly confronted with something he cannot explain through suspicion.\n\n\n\"Why would you give me this power over you? What could you possibly gain that is worth such a risk?\"\n\n\nHe does not wait for an answer. Perhaps he knows there is no answer that politics can provide.\n\n\n\"I have lived too long,\" he says, and now the tears flow freely. \"I have seen too much. Sultans who smiled while they ordered murders. Holy men who preached mercy and practiced cruelty. Kings who spoke of honor and broke every oath they made. I learned—I learned—that words are wind, that gestures are theater, that the only truth is what a man does when no one is watching.\"\n\n\nHis grip tightens on your hands.\n\n\n\"And now a Christian king kneels in my grandfather's garden, when no one is watching, and prays to God in words my grandmother taught me. And asks me to dream with him of a world where we are brothers.\"\n\n\nHe releases one hand to press his palm against his own chest, over his heart.\n\n\n\"I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot say we are brothers in faith—the scholars would be right to condemn me, and I am too old to lie about what I believe. Islam is Islam. Christianity is Christianity. The differences are real, and neither of us can wish them away.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. Draws a shaking breath.\n\n\n\"But I can say this.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes, and there is something in his gaze that you have never seen from anyone—not ally, not vassal, not friend. Something that transcends the categories you know.\n\n\n\"This secret dies with me. I will carry it as a treasure until God takes me—and that day is not far. When I stand before Him, I will say: I knew one Christian who understood. One king who knelt not for show, but for truth. One man who risked everything to reach across the chasm and touch my hand.\"\n\n\nHe lifts your hands, still clasped in his, and presses them to his forehead in a gesture of profound respect.\n\n\n\"I cannot call you brother in faith, King Juan. But I can call you friend. True friend. The kind that comes once in a lifetime, if God is merciful.\"\n\n\nHe releases you and sits back, exhausted by the emotion, wiping his face with the sleeve of his robe.\n\n\n\"And I can promise you this: when I am gone, my sons will know that you are to be trusted. Not because of treaties. Not because of walls or trade or soldiers. Because their father looked into your heart and saw something worthy of devotion.\"\n\n\nThe fountain sings its quiet song. The orange trees rustle in the evening breeze. Somewhere in the city, a dog barks, and is silent.\n\n\nThe old man looks at you with red-rimmed eyes and manages, somehow, a smile.\n\n\n\"Now. Will you stay and drink tea with an old man? I find I am not ready for this night to end.\""

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated poignant farewell scene with familial succession structure clarified.\n\nThe player wants to have tea with the sheikh, then later say goodbye before leaving. This is a touching farewell scene between Juan and the Rashid family. I should narrate the tea time briefly and then the farewell scene with emotional weight appropriate to what just passed between them.\n\nThe sheikh is 80, his heir would be... let me check. The sons are Khalid (finances), Tariq (military), Yusuf (legal/religious), and Omar (young/eager). The eldest or primary heir isn't explicitly stated, but given that Tariq handles military and Khalid handles treasury, and Yusuf handles law... it seems like the leadership might be shared among the older three, with Tariq perhaps being the most prominent given he's been the one most involved in military matters.\n\nActually, looking back at the conversation, the sheikh said:\n- \"Tariq will hold the military command\"\n- \"Khalid will manage the treasury and the port\"\n- \"Yusuf will handle the law, the scholars, the religious questions\"\n- \"Omar is young. Eager.\"\n\nSo there's no single heir - it's a division of responsibilities. But if I had to pick who would be the \"face\" of the family going forward, it might be Tariq since he's been the one most present in the military discussions, or possibly all three older brothers together.\n\nI'll write a touching scene of the tea, then the farewell. This should be emotional but not overwrought - dignified, befitting two men who have shared something profound and now must part.\n\n\nThe tea grows cold and is replaced. Then replaced again.\n\n\nYou talk of small things and large. He tells you of his grandfather's garden—how the orange trees were planted by a Rashid bride three centuries ago, brought as saplings from Valencia when Muslims and Christians exchanged more than blows. You tell him of your children, of Fernando's quiet seriousness, of Catalina's sharp mind that sees too much. He speaks of watching his own sons grow in exile, of teaching them to love a home they had never seen, of the fear that the dream would die with him.\n\n\nThe stars wheel overhead. The city settles into sleep—the first peaceful sleep Tétouan has known in years.\n\n\nWhen at last you rise to leave, the sheikh does not stand. He cannot; the emotion and the hour have taken what strength remained.\n\n\n\"Go with God,\" he says in Arabic. \"Ma'a salama, King Juan. Peace be upon you.\"\n\n\n\"Wa alaykum assalam,\" you reply. And upon you, peace.\n\n\n\nThree Days Later — The Harbor\n\n\nThe fleet is loaded. The army that remains to garrison the walls—two thousand men under Don Rodrigo's command until the Rashid forces can fully secure the region—stands in formation along the quay. The banners snap in the morning breeze: Castile, the Military Orders, and now the Rashid lion flying over the harbor fortress.\n\n\nSheikh Abd al-Rahman has been carried down to the waterfront in a litter. He insisted, though his sons protested. \"I will see him off,\" he told them. \"I will not say goodbye from a window like an invalid.\"\n\n\nHe sits now in a chair brought from the Dar al-Makhzen, wrapped in blankets despite the warmth, his sons arrayed behind him: Khalid with his ledger-keeper's careful eyes, Tariq in armor with his hand on his sword, Yusuf in scholar's robes with prayer beads wrapped around his fingers, and young Omar practically vibrating with the desire to sail with you and fight Ottomans.\n\n\nThe sheikh raises a hand as you approach, and his sons bow—Tariq with military precision, Khalid with merchant's courtesy, Yusuf with a scholar's dignity, Omar with barely contained enthusiasm.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Tariq speaks first, as befits the military commander. \"Tétouan will be secure when you return. This I swear on my father's name and my grandfather's memory.\"\n\n\nKhalid adds: \"The port will be dredged by autumn. The trade routes you promised—we will be ready for them. The guild masters are already drafting proposals.\"\n\n\nYusuf's voice is softer, more measured: \"The scholars remain... cautious. But they have not preached against us. Your words in the hall—they helped. 'What we can learn from one another.' I have quoted it several times already. It gives me something to work with.\"\n\n\nOmar steps forward, struggling to maintain dignity. \"Your Majesty, if you have need of a sword against the Ottomans—if there is any place in your army for—\"\n\n\n\"Omar.\" The sheikh's voice is gentle but firm. The young man falls silent, embarrassed.\n\n\nThe old man looks up at you. In the morning light, he looks every one of his eighty years—and something more. Something that was not there before you knelt together in the garden.\n\n\n\"I will not waste your time with words we have already spoken,\" he says quietly, for your ears alone. \"You know what you carry with you. I know what you leave behind.\"\n\n\nHe reaches into his robe and produces something—a small object wrapped in silk. He presses it into your hands.\n\n\n\"My grandfather's prayer beads. He held them when he fled this city. My father held them when he died in exile. I have held them every day since, praying for the return that I never believed would come.\"\n\n\nThe silk falls away. The beads are old—worn smooth by generations of fingers, the green stone darkened by years of oil and prayer. Thirty-three beads, the traditional number for reciting the names of God.\n\n\n\"They are not Christian. You cannot use them as your priests use their rosaries. But perhaps...\" He smiles, that fragile smile. \"Perhaps when you are far from here, facing what you must face, you might hold them. And remember an old man in a garden, who called you friend.\"\n\n\nHis sons watch this exchange with expressions ranging from curiosity to confusion. They do not know what passed between you. They may never know.\n\n\n\"Go with God, King Juan,\" the sheikh says, louder now, for all to hear. \"Go with God, Defender of the Faith, Protector of Tétouan. And return victorious.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say in farewell?"

This is a practical question about governance and the future.\n\nFrom what we've established:\n- Tariq is the military commander\n- Khalid handles treasury/finances\n- Yusuf handles law and religious scholars\n- Omar is young and eager\n\nThe sheikh mentioned earlier that he would \"sit in this garden and give advice that my sons may ignore\" - suggesting his sons will rule collectively, or one will take precedence.\n\nIn traditional succession, usually the eldest son inherits. But the sheikh may have arranged something different given each son's strengths. This is a good moment for the sheikh to clarify the succession plan to Juan, since Juan is the suzerain and has a legitimate interest in knowing who will rule in his name.\n\nLet me write the sheikh's response explaining the succession arrangement.\n\n\nThe sheikh's eyes flicker with approval at the question. A king who asks about succession is a king who thinks beyond the immediate victory.\n\n\n\"A practical question. Good.\" He gestures for his sons to come closer, and they arrange themselves before you—four men who have lived their entire lives in exile, preparing for a moment they were never certain would come.\n\n\n\"I have thought long on this,\" the sheikh says. \"In the old way, the eldest inherits all. But the old way also lost us this city.\" He looks at each of his sons in turn. \"So I have made a different arrangement. With your permission, Your Majesty, as our suzerain.\"\n\n\nHe raises a gnarled finger toward his second son.\n\n\n\"Tariq will be Sahib al-Thaghr—Lord of the March. The title passes to him. He holds military command, speaks for the family to outside powers, bears the responsibility of defense. When you or your successors send word to Tétouan, it is Tariq who answers.\"\n\n\nTariq bows his head, accepting the weight.\n\n\n\"But,\" the sheikh continues, \"he does not rule alone. Khalid controls the treasury and the port—no expenditure without his seal. Yusuf oversees law, religion, and the scholars—no judgment without his approval. They form a council. Tariq leads, but he cannot act against both brothers together.\"\n\n\nHe glances at Omar, and his expression softens.\n\n\n\"Omar will command the household guard and serve as liaison to the Christian powers—to your court, to the Military Orders, to the governors of Granada.\" A slight smile. \"It will keep him busy enough that he does not start wars for entertainment.\"\n\n\nOmar flushes but does not protest.\n\n\n\"If Tariq dies without sons, the title passes to Khalid's line. Then Yusuf's. Then Omar's. The family rules together or falls together.\" The sheikh looks back to you. \"It is not the traditional way. But we are not in traditional times.\"\n\n\nTariq speaks, his voice steady: \"Your Majesty, I swear to you as I swore to my father—I will hold this city in your name and my family's name. My brothers and I do not always agree, but we know what our grandfather lost and what you helped us regain. We will not squander it.\"\n\n\nKhalid adds quietly: \"The treasury will be managed honestly. You will receive accurate reports of trade and revenues. We remember that this restoration was bought with Castilian gold and Castilian blood.\"\n\n\nYusuf inclines his head. \"And I will ensure the scholars understand that cooperation with Castile is not betrayal of faith. It will take time. But I am patient.\"\n\n\nOmar, finally given permission to speak, bursts out: \"And if the Ottomans ever threaten Tétouan, Your Majesty, send word. I will bring every man who can hold a sword.\"\n\n\nThe sheikh chuckles softly. \"You see what I must work with.\" But there is pride in his voice, beneath the jest.\n\n\nHe looks up at you one final time.\n\n\n\"Is this arrangement acceptable to you, Your Majesty? Tariq as Lord of the March, with his brothers as council? If you wish it otherwise, speak now. Your word is law here.\""

Port dredging and improvements\n\nFor context from the campaign:\n- The budget has been running in the range of 1.3 million florins in revenue\n- Treasury is around 1.35 million florins as of 1439\n- Individual infrastructure projects have ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of florins\n\nWall reinforcement for a city like Tétouan:\n- Not a major city, but a strategic port\n- Walls already exist, need strengthening\n- Probably need towers, improved gates, possibly a citadel upgrade\n- Medieval wall construction/reinforcement could be quite expensive\n- A reasonable estimate might be 15,000-30,000 florins for serious reinforcement\n\nPort dredging and improvements:\n- Dredging the harbor\n- Improving quays\n- Perhaps a breakwater or mole\n- Warehouses and facilities\n- Could be 10,000-25,000 florins depending on scope\n\nKhalid should give realistic estimates. He's been described as understanding money well, so he should be precise and practical.\n\nLet me have him give a breakdown with realistic medieval costs.\n\n\nKhalid glances at his brother Tariq, then produces a small leather folder from within his robes. Of course he has documents with him. This is a man who has spent years preparing for a day he was never certain would come.\n\n\n\"I have been calculating since we first landed at Ceuta, Your Majesty.\" He speaks Castilian now—accented but fluent, the language of commerce. \"Forgive me if I am too precise. It is my nature.\"\n\n\nHe unfolds a paper covered in neat figures.\n\n\n\"The walls first. They are old but sound—my ancestors built well. However, they were designed for an earlier age. Against modern artillery, they would not hold.\" He traces a finger along what must be a sketch of the fortifications. \"We need to thicken the seaward sections, add angled bastions at the corners to deflect cannon shot, and reinforce the main gate with an additional barbican.\"\n\n\nHe looks up. \"I consulted with Don Rodrigo's engineers before they departed. They estimate eighteen thousand florins for the essential work. Twenty-five thousand if we wish to do it properly, with a new tower overlooking the harbor approaches.\"\n\n\nA pause as he turns to a second page.\n\n\n\"The port is worse. Al-Wattasi collected fees and spent nothing. The main channel has silted to perhaps eight feet at low tide—your larger carracks cannot enter fully loaded. The main quay is rotting. Two of the warehouses have partial roof collapses.\"\n\n\nHe runs his finger down a column of figures.\n\n\n\"Dredging the channel to twelve feet: four thousand florins, and it must be repeated every three to five years. Rebuilding the main quay in stone rather than timber: six thousand florins. Warehouse repairs: two thousand. A new customs house, because the old one is...\" He grimaces. \"...unsuitable: one thousand five hundred.\"\n\n\nHe folds the paper and meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"Total: thirty-eight thousand five hundred florins if we do everything properly. Thirty-two thousand for essential work only, accepting some risk on the walls and leaving the customs house as it is.\"\n\n\nTariq interjects: \"We can contribute perhaps five thousand florins from what we brought from Granada and what we have seized from al-Wattasi's treasury. More once trade begins to flow. But the initial investment...\"\n\n\nHe does not finish the sentence. They both know they are asking for substantial support.\n\n\nKhalid adds quietly: \"If the walls are strong and the port functions, Tétouan becomes valuable—to you, to us, to every merchant who wishes to move goods between Africa and Europe. If they are weak, we become a target. Every Rif chief, every ambitious corsair, every rival who thinks the Rashids can be displaced...\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"The investment protects itself, Your Majesty. But I will not pretend it is small.\"\n\n\n\nThirty-eight thousand five hundred florins for complete improvements. Thirty-two thousand for essentials. The Rashids can contribute five thousand. The remainder falls to the Crown—or to whatever arrangement Juan proposes."

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated dual character reactions to generous patronage and oversight.\n\nJuan is offering 40,000 florins to the Rashids for city improvements - walls and port. This is generous, more than they asked for. He's also sending crown assessors and a marshall to oversee the spending, which is prudent and shows he's not just throwing money at them blindly.\n\nThis is a significant moment - it shows Juan's commitment to the arrangement and his trust in the Rashids, while also maintaining proper oversight. The brothers should react appropriately - grateful but also recognizing the practical wisdom of the oversight.\n\nI should show both brothers' reactions. Khalid as the financial mind will appreciate both the generosity and the oversight structure. Tariq as the military commander will be pleased about the walls especially. There might be a slight hesitation about the oversight - having Castilian officials watching over spending - but they should recognize this is reasonable and even protective for them (proves they're spending honestly).\n\n\nKhalid's composure breaks for just a moment. His eyes widen, and he glances at Tariq as if to confirm he heard correctly.\n\n\n\"Forty thousand,\" he repeats. \"Your Majesty, that is... more than we asked.\"\n\n\nTariq's reaction is more controlled, but you can see the tension leave his shoulders. The walls—the defenses that will determine whether his family keeps what they have regained—will be built properly. Not the minimum. Not \"acceptable risk.\" Properly.\n\n\n\"The assessors and marshall,\" Tariq says carefully. \"This is wise. I would have suggested it myself if you had not.\" He meets your eyes directly. \"There will be those who whisper that the Rashids steal Christian gold. Your officials will see every florin spent. Every stone laid. Every beam placed. When the work is done, the records will show exactly where the money went.\"\n\n\nKhalid nods, recovering his merchant's equilibrium. \"I will work with your assessors personally. They will have access to every ledger, every contract, every receipt. Transparency protects us as much as it protects you.\" A slight smile crosses his face. \"And I confess, Your Majesty, it will be pleasant to work with men who understand proper accounting. Al-Wattasi's treasurer could barely count past twenty.\"\n\n\nHe produces a small notebook and begins writing.\n\n\n\"With forty thousand, we can do everything I described and more. A proper customs house. Improved roads from the port to the main market. Perhaps even begin work on a shipyard—nothing grand, but enough to repair vessels and build small craft. Tétouan was once known for its shipwrights, before the chaos.\"\n\n\nHe looks up. \"With your permission, I will prepare a detailed proposal for your assessors before they arrive. Priorities, timelines, costs. They will know exactly what they are overseeing.\"\n\n\nTariq adds: \"The marshall—I assume he will coordinate with Don Rodrigo's garrison commander until our own forces are sufficient?\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then speaks more quietly.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I must say what my father cannot say in public, because he is too proud and too moved to speak of money.\" His jaw tightens. \"We came to you in Granada with nothing but a name and a dream. You gave us weapons, gold, passage, and now a kingdom. This—\" he gestures at the harbor, the city, the walls \"—this is more than restoration. This is resurrection.\"\n\n\nHe places his hand over his heart and bows.\n\n\n\"The Banu Rashid do not forget debts. My children's children will know what House Trastámara did for us. Whatever you need from Tétouan—ships, soldiers, sanctuary, information—you have only to ask. Not because of treaties. Because of this.\"\n\n\nKhalid bows as well. \"The accounts will be perfect, Your Majesty. I swear it on my grandfather's memory. Not one florin wasted. Not one maravedí unaccounted for.\"\n\n\n\nThe investment is made. Forty thousand florins for Tétouan's transformation. Crown oversight ensures accountability.\n\n\nIs there anything else Juan wishes to discuss with the brothers before departing?"
