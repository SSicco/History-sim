Let me review:\n\n1. The chapter summary says:\n- Date: Late 1435 (Autumn/Winter)\n- Location: Alcázar of Segovia (administrative session)\n- Present: Diego de Daza\n- Situation: Economic review session concluded; documentation complete\n- Condition: Juan healthy\n\n2. There are several unresolved threads mentioned:\n- Ibrahim al-Fakhkhar - ceramics master situation\n- Sultan Murad II Meeting at Tenedos (Spring 1435 - may have already occurred)\n- Constantinople Settlement ongoing\n- Queen Lucia's pregnancy (status unknown)\n- Administrative reforms at ~85%\n\nHowever, there's a timeline issue. The summary says \"Late 1435 (Autumn/Winter)\" but notes that the \"Sultan Murad II Meeting: Scheduled for Tenedos (Spring 1435 - may have already occurred or be imminent)\"\n\nThis is confusing because if we're in late 1435, the Spring 1435 meeting would have already happened. But looking at Chapter 2.37, which reviewed economic measures, it seems primarily focused on documentation. It's possible the Tenedos meeting wasn't addressed yet in detail.\n\nLooking at the character database:\n- Queen Lucia: Currently pregnant, child due September 1435\n- If we're in late 1435, she may have already given birth\n\nWait, let me look more carefully at this. The chapter summary says \"Late 1435 (Autumn/Winter)\" but the character database was last updated December 22, 2025 and says:\n- \"Currently pregnant again, conceived late December 1434/January 1435\"\n- \"Child due September 1435, exceptional health\"\n\nSo by late 1435, Lucia should have given birth already. But the chapter summary says her pregnancy \"status unknown.\"\n\nThere seems to be some timeline confusion here. Let me just pick up where Chapter 2.37 left off - in the Alcázar of Segovia with Diego de Daza, after the economic review session.\n\n\nI'll focus on continuing the narrative from the precise administrative moment, maintaining the administrative tone and setting of the previous chapter's conclusion.\n\n\nNow I have the necessary information. Let me present the chapter introduction.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.38\n\n\nLate 1435 (Autumn/Winter), Afternoon\n\n\nYou are in your private study within the Alcázar of Segovia. The economic review session with Diego de Daza has concluded, and the afternoon light slants low through the narrow windows, casting long shadows across the maps and ledgers spread upon your desk. The two comprehensive documents—the Economic Measures Summary and the updated Trade Database—lie before you, fresh ink dried upon parchment that represents years of careful planning now quantified and catalogued.\n\n\nDiego de Daza gathers the final papers, his methodical movements unchanged despite the weight of the numbers he has presented. The review has been sobering: cloth self-sufficiency lies a generation away, Ibrahim al-Fakhkhar's golden luster knowledge teeters on the edge of extinction, and the conquest's disruption to Granada's economy still outpaces the benefits of your crown industries—at least for now.\n\n\nThe kingdom's treasury remains robust from the successes of 1434—the Portuguese maritime understanding, the Constantinople settlement campaign, the administrative reforms reaching completion. But the work of building an economy that does not bleed gold to Flemish and English weavers is only beginning.\n\n\nOutside, you hear the distant sounds of the Segovia garrison at their drills, and somewhere in the castle, servants prepare for the evening meal. Several matters demand attention: the Sultan Murad II and the planned Tenedos meeting, Queen Lucia's pregnancy entering its final months, the ongoing settler convoys to Constantinople, and the aging ceramics master whose knowledge may die with him."

Let me search for more specific information about the 20,000 florins investment and any subsequent exploration results.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see:\n1. Juan gave 10,000 florins as an immediate gift in November 1434\n2. An additional 10,000 florins was committed in Chapter 2.32 (February 1435)\n\nSo the total is 20,000 florins as the user mentioned.

Let me research the historical context for Portuguese exploration around 1435 to ensure the table is historically grounded.\n\nKey points from the project files:\n- Cape Bojador was passed in 1433 (historically accurate - Gil Eanes passed it in August 1434)\n- Juan gave 10,000 florins in November 1434 as an immediate gift\n- An additional 10,000 florins was committed in Chapter 2.32 (February 1435)\n- So the total 20,000 florins investment is correct\n- We're now in late 1435\n\nLet me search for historical information about Portuguese exploration progress around 1434-1436 to calibrate the table properly.\n\n\nLet me research the historical context for Portuguese exploration around 1435 to properly calibrate this table:\n\n\nWeb Search: Portuguese exploration 1434 1435 1436 Cape Bojador Gil Eanes discoveries Africa\n\nGil Eannes Passes the Point of No Return at Cape Bojador—And Inaugurates a New Era in Exploration | Encyclopedia.com encyclopedia.com\n\n\nGil Eanes - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\n\nGil Eannes | Encyclopedia.com encyclopedia.com\n\n\nPortuguese Exploration of the African coastline - The map as History the-map-as-history.com\n\n\nGil Eannes - Biography - Enchanted Learning enchantedlearning.com\n\n\nPortuguese maritime exploration - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\n\nVoyages of Discovery - by Alastair Leithead substack.com\n\n\nGil Eanes grokipedia.com\n\n\nGil Eanes voicemap.me\n\n\nGil Eanes | Portugal Visitor Travel Guide To Portugal portugalvisitor.com\n\nThought process: Contextualized Portuguese exploration progress and calibrated discovery outcomes.\n\nThis is very helpful. Let me summarize the historical context:\n\n1. **1434**: Gil Eanes successfully rounded Cape Bojador for the first time, returning with \"St. Mary's roses\" as proof\n2. **1435**: Gil Eanes and Afonso Gonçalves Baldaia sailed further south, discovered Garnet Bay (Angra dos Ruivos) and reached Rio de Ouro (Gold River). They saw human footprints and camel tracks, indicating proximity to nomadic populations. Baldaya collected sealskins - the first commercial cargo from West Africa.\n3. **1436**: Fleet returned to Portugal by early 1436 with modest findings\n\nSo in the campaign timeline (late 1435), the expedition of Eanes and Baldaia would have been underway or recently returned. Juan's 20,000 florins would have contributed to accelerating and expanding these expeditions.\n\nThe historical baseline shows:\n- Progress was being made, but slowly\n- Findings were modest: plant specimens, animal skins, signs of human habitation\n- No major wealth discovered yet (gold/salt trade would come later)\n- The psychological barrier was broken, opening the way for further exploration\n\nWith Juan's 20,000 florins investment (which is ENORMOUS for exploration - Henry scraped together every coin for 20 years), the Portuguese would have:\n- More ships available\n- Better provisioned expeditions\n- Ability to send multiple expeditions\n- Potentially faster progress\n\nLet me build a d100 table that reflects realistic possibilities, enhanced by the significant funding:\n\n**Factors enhancing success:**\n- 20,000 florins is a MASSIVE investment for exploration\n- Henry the Navigator is an experienced organizer\n- Cape Bojador was passed in 1434 - psychological barrier broken\n- Portuguese have caravel technology\n- Strong personal relationship between Henry and Juan\n- Shared vision and commitment\n\n**Factors limiting success:**\n- Exploration takes time regardless of funding\n- Ships still need to return with information\n\n\n- Exploration is constrained by several critical challenges. The timeline is extremely short - less than a year since the investment began. Uncharted territories remain perilous, with unknown geographical and human risks. Logistical challenges like distance, seasonal weather patterns, and limited navigational knowledge significantly impact potential progress.\n\nPotential outcomes reflect these complex constraints:\n- Most probable scenario involves incremental coastal mapping and initial trade contacts\n- Good outcomes might include identifying commercial potential or establishing initial relationships with local populations\n- Exceptional results could reveal significant geographical features or early trade opportunities\n- Worst-case scenarios involve expedition delays, potential ship losses, and minimal territorial advancement\n\nThe investment's true value lies in creating momentum for future exploration, despite immediate limitations.\n\n\nExcellent. Based on the historical research, I can now construct a proper chaos roll table.\n\n\n\nDiego de Daza pauses at the door, ledgers under his arm. \"Will there be anything else, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\nBut your mind has already turned elsewhere—to the Ocean Sea, to Prince Henry's caravels, and to the 20,000 florins you've invested in his African ventures. The first 10,000 was a gift presented through King Duarte in late 1434; the second 10,000 followed in early 1435 during the maritime union discussions. It is now late autumn 1435—nearly a year since your partnership began.\n\n\n\"Actually, Diego—have we received any word from Portugal? From Prince Henry regarding the exploration?\"\n\n\nThe administrator frowns, searching his memory. \"The maritime treaty correspondence, yes, but exploration specifically...\" He shakes his head. \"I would need to check the diplomatic correspondence. Shall I inquire with Álvaro?\"\n\n\nYou wave him off. The question is simple enough: what has Henry accomplished with your gold?\n\n\n\nChaos Roll: Portuguese African Exploration Results (Late 1435)\n\n\nHistorical Context:\n\n\nIn 1434, Gil Eannes rounded Cape Bojador, opening the way to the world beyond. A year later, Eannes sailed a bit further down the coast past Cape Bojador, where he and fellow explorer Alfonso Gonçalves Baldaya saw signs of life: human footprints and camel tracks.\n\nBaldaya continued further south, where he traded for sealskins, the first commercial cargo brought back to Europe from West Africa.\n\nPortuguese navigators reached ever more southerly latitudes, advancing at an average rate of one degree a year.\n\n\nFactors Enhancing Results:\n\n\n20,000 florins is extraordinary funding (Henry has scraped together every coin for 20 years—this doubles or triples his resources)\n\nCape Bojador barrier already broken (1434)—psychological obstacle removed\n\nCaravel technology allows windward sailing\n\nStrong personal motivation from Henry (family connection to Juan)\n\nPortuguese maritime expertise at its peak\n\n\nFactors Limiting Results:\n\n\nOnly ~12 months since investment began\n\nExploration still requires time regardless of funding\n\nUnknown territories remain dangerous\n\nSeasonal sailing windows constrain voyages\n\nDistance and logistics of multi-month expeditions\n\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-5\nDisaster: Ship losses. One or more vessels lost to storms, reefs, or unknown hazards. Crew casualties. Henry requests additional support to replace losses. Progress halted.\n6-15\nSetbacks: Expeditions delayed by weather, provisioning problems, or crew difficulties. Minimal new discoveries. Henry reports the money is being well-spent on preparations but tangible results will come next year.\n16-35\nModest Progress: Coast mapped 50-100 leagues beyond previous limits. Sealskins and other trade goods collected. Signs of human habitation observed. Commercially unexciting but geographically valuable. Standard historical pace despite additional funding.\n36-55\nSolid Progress: Coast mapped 100-150 leagues south. Multiple expeditions launched. First direct contact with coastal populations. Trade goods including hides, some local commodities. Henry reports the investment is accelerating progress significantly.\n56-75\nGood Progress: Significant territorial discoveries. Major geographical features identified (river mouths, bays, islands). Sustainable trade relationships being established. Evidence of caravan routes or population centers that suggest proximity to trans-Saharan trade networks.\n76-90\nExcellent Progress: Discovery of a significant harbor or river system. First reports of gold dust or other precious trade goods obtained from coastal peoples. Evidence suggesting proximity to the gold kingdoms Henry has long sought. Commercial potential now tangible.\n91-97\nExceptional Discovery: Portuguese reach the coast near Arguim or equivalent strategic point. Direct evidence of gold trade routes. Possibility of establishing a permanent trading post identified. Henry's vision of outflanking the Muslim trade monopoly appears achievable within years, not decades.\n98-100\nHistoric Breakthrough: Discovery surpassing historical pace by years. Perhaps the Senegal River or other major waterway. Direct contact with peoples who trade in gold. Proof that Africa extends far south with wealthy kingdoms beyond the Sahara. Strategic and commercial implications are immense.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

This means:\n\n\"Discovery of a significant harbor or river system. First reports of gold dust or other precious trade goods obtained from coastal peoples. Evidence suggesting proximity to the gold kingdoms Henry has long sought. Commercial potential now tangible.\"\n\nLet me think about what this would historically look like. In real history:\n- 1434: Gil Eannes rounds Cape Bojador\n- 1435: Eannes and Baldaya sail further south, see footprints and camel tracks, reach Rio de Ouro (Gold River - though it wasn't actually gold-bearing)\n- 1436: Baldaya reaches the coast further south\n- 1441: First captives and gold dust brought back\n- 1443: Nuno Tristão reaches Arguim Gulf\n- 1444: Dinis Dias reaches Cape Verde\n\nWith the extra funding (20,000 florins is massive for Henry's operations), progress could be accelerated. A roll of 85 suggests they've made discoveries that in our timeline would have taken until 1441 or so - perhaps they've already reached areas where gold dust is obtainable, or they've found something like Arguim.\n\nI should narrate this as a report arriving, perhaps a letter or messenger from Portugal. I need to stop when the information is delivered and let Juan respond.\n\nLet me craft this carefully - showing excellent progress without going too far beyond what's plausible with accelerated funding.\n\n\nA messenger from Portugal arrives three days later, bearing a sealed letter with Prince Henry's personal sigil. The man has ridden hard from Lisbon—dust-caked and weary—and insists the correspondence is for your eyes alone.\n\n\nYou break the seal in your study, the winter light pale through the windows.\n\n\n\nTo His Most Christian Majesty Juan II, King of Castile and León, Defensor Romaniae,\n\n\nBrother in Christ and in the memory of my beloved sister Isabel,\n\n\nI write with news that justifies every florin of your extraordinary generosity, and more besides.\n\n\nYour investment has allowed me to do what two decades of scraping and begging never could: launch multiple expeditions in a single sailing season, with properly provisioned ships and crews who need not fear starvation if the winds turn foul.\n\n\nGil Eannes and Afonso Baldaya have surpassed all previous ventures. They have sailed far beyond Cape Bojador—some two hundred leagues or more—and discovered what I believe may be the mouth of a great river. The coast there is less barren than the Saharan wastes above. More importantly, they made contact with fishing peoples along the shore.\n\n\nAnd here is the prize, Juan: gold dust.\n\n\nNot in great quantities—not yet—but unmistakably gold, traded from the hands of dark-skinned men who gestured inland, toward the rising sun. The Moors have long spoken of kingdoms beyond the desert where gold is as common as salt. I believe we are approaching those lands from the sea.\n\n\nBaldaya has also identified a deep bay suitable for anchorage—a place where ships might shelter and take on water. I intend to establish a permanent presence there within the year. A trading post. Perhaps, God willing, a fortress.\n\n\nThe sealskins and hides we have collected are commercially modest, but they prove the principle: Africa has wealth, and we can reach it without passing through Muslim hands.\n\n\nI am already preparing expeditions for the spring sailing season. With continued support, I believe we may reach the source of the gold trade within five years—perhaps fewer. The dream we discussed in Toledo grows closer to reality with each voyage.\n\n\nYou strike from the East. I strike from the South. Between us, we shall break the Saracen stranglehold on the wealth of the world.\n\n\nYour brother in Christ and enterprise,\n\n\nHenrique, Infante of Portugal\n\n\nWritten at Sagres, the Feast of All Saints, Anno Domini 1435\n\n\n\nThe letter trembles slightly in your hands. Gold dust. A harbor for a trading post. Two hundred leagues of African coast mapped in a single season—progress that might have taken Henry years with his meager resources.\n\n\nAnd the implicit promise: the gold kingdoms of Mali, the legendary wealth that flows north through Taghaza and Timbuktu to enrich the Marinid sultans... accessible by sea. Outflanking Islam entirely."

This is a significant request that will require me to think about:\n\n1. Which Military Orders are relevant and where their Masters are\n2. Whether this request makes sense for the Military Orders\n3. How the Masters would react to such a proposal\n\nLet me check the character database for the Military Order Masters and their current situations.\n\nFrom the character database, I know:\n- The Military Orders (Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara) have been involved in the Constantinople settlement initiative\n- They've been surveying settlers and contributing to the fleet\n- Master of Santiago, Master of Calatrava, Master of Alcántara are the key figures\n\nThis is an interesting request. The Military Orders historically:\n- Were focused on the Reconquista (now complete in this timeline)\n- Had experience defending frontier territories\n- Had resources (men, money, land)\n- Were looking for new purpose after Granada fell\n\nHowever, establishing outposts in Africa is quite different from their traditional role. This would be:\n- Far from their traditional territories\n- Requiring naval capability they may not have\n- A commercial/exploration venture rather than crusading\n- Potentially straining their resources already committed to Constantinople\n\nI should:\n1. Have the Masters summoned\n2. Present their reactions realistically - some interest, some skepticism\n3. Not have them immediately agree - this is a significant ask\n4. Consider what's in it for them\n\nLet me search for more context on the Military Orders' current state and commitments.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Reconciled character inconsistencies and weighed Orders' capacity for African expansion.\n\nNow I have good context. The Military Orders are already heavily committed to:\n1. Constantinople settlement (1,000 families per year from Order lands)\n2. Building their own fleet at Almería (receiving 15,000 florins annually from Juan)\n3. Maintaining fortresses throughout Granada\n4. Fighting piracy\n\nThe Masters are:\n- Don Luis de Guzmán, Master of Santiago (largest Order)\n- Don Pedro González de Padilla, Master of Calatrava\n- Don Gutierre de Sotomayor, Master of Alcántara (but he's in Constantinople commanding the expedition)\n\nWait, I need to check this - the character database shows some confusion about names. Let me look more carefully...\n\nFrom the search results, I see references to:\n- Don Rodrigo Manrique - Master of Santiago (in Chapter 2.30)\n- Don García López de Padilla - Master of Calatrava (in Chapter 2.30)\n- Don Fernando de Solís - Commander of Alcántara (representing Master Sotomayor in Constantinople)\n\nBut the character database updated shows:\n- Don Luis de Guzmán, Master of Santiago\n- Don Pedro González de Padilla, Master of Calatrava\n\nThere's some inconsistency here. I should use the most recent references from the chapter summaries. Let me go with what Chapter 2.30 says since that's the most recent meeting with the Masters.\n\nActually, looking at the character database more carefully:\n- Don Luis de Guzmán, Master of Santiago\n- Don Pedro González de Padilla, Master of Calatrava  \n- Don Gutierre de Sotomayor, Master of Alcántara (in Constantinople)\n\nThe Chapter 2.30 reference to \"Don Rodrigo Manrique\" and \"Don García López de Padilla\" might be an error or these might be different people. I should use the character database as the authoritative source.\n\nNow, for this scene, Juan is asking the Military Orders to help establish outposts in Africa - specifically at Arguim and near the newly discovered river mouth. \n\nJuan faces significant challenges convincing the Orders to expand into Africa. Their current obligations are extensive, and the proposed venture seems far removed from their traditional military and religious missions. The papal decree offers a potential justification, providing a legal framework for expansion beyond Iberian territories. Moreover, the Orders are seeking a new purpose after the Reconquista, making this African expedition an intriguing opportunity to maintain their relevance and power.\n\nThe strategic partnership with Portugal adds weight to the proposal, leveraging familial and political connections. I'll craft a scene capturing the nuanced reactions of the Order's leadership - balancing cautious pragmatism with potential strategic ambition.\n\n\nThe summons go out that same day. Within a week, the Masters gather in the great hall of the Alcázar of Segovia—or at least, those who can attend.\n\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán, Master of Santiago, arrives first, his bearing as political and measured as ever. The largest and wealthiest Order follows his lead, and he knows it. Don Pedro González de Padilla, Master of Calatrava, comes next—a man who has found renewed purpose in the Constantinople mission after struggling with the question of what his Order meant after the Reconquista.\n\n\nFor Alcántara, Commander Fernando de Solís attends in place of Master Gutierre de Sotomayor, who remains in Constantinople commanding the expedition there.\n\n\nThey sit across from you at the council table, curious but wary. You have asked much of them this past year—Constantinople settlers, fleet construction at Almería, fortress garrisons throughout Granada, piracy patrols. They have answered every call. But their resources are not infinite.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Don Luis begins, inclining his head. \"Your summons spoke of Africa. We are... intrigued.\"\n\n\nDon Pedro nods slowly. \"The Orders have discussed among ourselves what role we might play along the African coast. The corsair threat from Salé remains. But your message suggested something more than piracy patrols.\"\n\n\nCommander de Solís, younger and more eager than the Masters, leans forward. \"Master Sotomayor writes from Constantinople that the expedition there proceeds well. He would not wish Alcántara excluded from any new venture, despite our commitments in the East.\"\n\n\nThe three men wait. Behind them, winter light falls through the high windows. A fire crackles in the great hearth.\n\n\nYou have their attention. But you can see the calculations already forming behind their eyes—how many knights, how many ships, how much gold, and whether their Orders can bear yet another burden atop those they already carry."

They're considering:\n1. Specialization - letting each Order focus on different tasks\n2. The assault on Salé (the corsair base)\n3. African outposts at Arguim and the newly discovered river mouth\n\nThis is a good moment for the Masters to respond to this idea. They would have opinions about specialization vs. the current division of labor. Let me think about how each Master would react:\n\n**Don Luis de Guzmán (Santiago)** - The largest, wealthiest, most political Order. They already have the most knights, the most ships, the most resources. He might be cautious about being \"typecast\" as just the Constantinople settlers - that could limit Santiago's prestige and expansion opportunities. On the other hand, Constantinople is the most prestigious assignment.\n\n**Don Pedro González de Padilla (Calatrava)** - Found renewed purpose in Constantinople. Calatrava has the strictest monastic discipline. They might be well-suited to establishing permanent, disciplined outposts. But they're also committed to Constantinople.\n\n**Commander Fernando de Solís (Alcántara)** - Speaking for Sotomayor who is in Constantinople. Alcántara is the smallest Order. \"Distant lands\" specialization could be appealing - it gives them a unique role that doesn't compete directly with the larger Orders. But they also have fewer resources.\n\nThe Masters would likely have mixed feelings:\n- Specialization could give each Order a unique identity and mission\n- But it could also limit their prestige and opportunities\n- They might worry about being \"stuck\" with one role forever\n- They might also see strategic advantages in having distinct competencies\n\nLet me also consider what's realistic here:\n- The Orders are already stretched with Constantinople, Granada garrisons, fleet building, and piracy patrols\n- Adding African outposts is yet another burden\n- Salé assault would require significant naval and military resources\n- Arguim and the river mouth are very distant - months of travel\n\n\nI should have the Masters engage thoughtfully with this proposal, raising concerns and offering perspectives. They shouldn't just agree - they have their own interests and limitations.\n\nI'll craft a nuanced dialogue where each Master carefully weighs the potential benefits and risks of specialized African missions. Their responses will reflect their Order's unique strengths, current commitments, and strategic ambitions. They'll probe the practical challenges of dividing responsibilities while maintaining flexibility for future opportunities.\n\n\nThe three men exchange glances.

A knight who knows one task deeply fights better than one who knows many tasks poorly.\" He pauses. \"But I confess some... concern.\"\n\n\nDon Pedro leans forward. \"Santiago fears being reduced to a colonization society,\" he says bluntly. Don Luis shoots him a sharp look, but the Calatrava Master continues. \"And rightly so. We are Military Orders. Our purpose is to fight for Christ, not merely to shepherd farmers onto ships.\"\n\n\n\"Constantinople is not farmer-shepherding,\" Commander de Solís interjects, a touch defensively. \"Master Sotomayor writes that our knights there train daily, reinforce the walls, patrol against Ottoman probes—\"\n\n\n\"Peace, Fernando.\" Don Luis raises a hand. \"No one disparages the Constantinople mission. It is the most prestigious assignment any of us have held in a generation.\" He turns back to you. \"But Don Pedro's point stands. If Santiago becomes 'the settlement Order' and Alcántara becomes 'the African Order,' what becomes of us when those tasks are complete? Do we fade into irrelevance, our purpose defined by geography rather than sacred duty?\"\n\n\nDon Pedro nods slowly. \"The Orders survived the Reconquista's end because Your Majesty gave us Constantinople—a new crusade. But crusades end. What then?\"\n\n\nThere is genuine anxiety beneath the political maneuvering. These men remember when the Orders seemed destined for obsolescence, their reason for existence completed with Granada's fall.\n\n\nCommander de Solís, younger and perhaps less burdened by such fears, offers a different perspective. \"Alcántara is the smallest Order. We cannot match Santiago's knights or Calatrava's wealth. If specialization means we hold distant outposts that the larger Orders cannot easily reach...\" He shrugs. \"That gives us purpose. Identity. We become essential rather than merely supplementary.\"\n\n\nDon Luis frowns. \"You would have Alcántara alone on the African coast while Santiago and Calatrava—\"\n\n\n\"I would have Alcántara first on the African coast,\" de Solís corrects. \"The vanguard. When the outposts grow into fortresses and the fortresses into cities, all Orders might share them. But someone must go first, and the smallest Order has the least to lose.\"\n\n\nA long silence follows. The fire pops and crackles.\n\n\nFinally, Don Pedro speaks. \"Your Majesty mentioned Salé. An assault on the corsair nest.\" His eyes sharpen with something that looks almost like hunger. \"That is war. That is crusade. If you speak of dividing labor, let Calatrava have a share of the fighting, not merely the building and the settling.\"\n\n\nDon Luis nods reluctantly. \"Santiago would say the same. We will settle Constantinople, patrol for pirates, garrison Granada—but we are warriors first. If there is battle to be had against the infidel, we must not be excluded.\"\n\n\nThe shape of a compromise begins to emerge. The Orders will accept specialization in peacetime tasks—settlement, outposts, patrols—but they insist on shared participation in any military campaign."

This is the language they understand—crusade, war, conquest.\n\n\nDon Luis strokes his beard thoughtfully. \"Salé,\" he murmurs. \"The Castilian crown has history there. King Alfonso X—your ancestor—took the city in 1260. Held it briefly before the Marinids reclaimed it.\"\n\n\n\"And rebuilt the walls afterward,\" Don Pedro adds. \"Stronger than before.\"\n\n\nCommander de Solís, eager to contribute, speaks up. \"I have spoken with mariners who know the Moroccan coast. Salé sits at the mouth of the Bou Regreg river. A protected harbor—one of the few good anchorages on that stretch of coast. The city itself has Marinid walls, gates, a naval arsenal.\"\n\n\nDon Luis nods slowly. \"Six thousand men is a respectable force. With cannons...\" He exchanges a look with Don Pedro. \"The question is not whether we can take the walls. The question is what happens after we take them.\"\n\n\nDon Pedro leans back. \"The Marinid sultanate is weak. Fractured. They rule from Fez, but their grip on the coastal cities has loosened over the past decades. Salé's garrison will not be large—perhaps a few hundred men at most. The corsairs themselves are sailors, not soldiers.\"\n\n\n\"But,\" Don Luis interjects, raising a finger, \"Morocco is not Granada. We cannot simply march inland and take Fez. If we seize Salé, we must hold it against counterattack. The Marinids will not accept a Christian fortress at the mouth of their river. They will gather what forces they can—and in Morocco, that means tribal levies, holy warriors, anyone who will answer a call to jihad against the infidel.\"\n\n\nCommander de Solís frowns. \"How many might they gather?\"\n\n\n\"Impossible to say with certainty,\" Don Luis admits. \"But if the Sultan calls for holy war? Ten thousand. Twenty thousand. Perhaps more, given time.\"\n\n\nDon Pedro taps the table. \"The Portuguese hold Ceuta. They have held it for twenty years now against constant pressure. It can be done—but it requires a permanent garrison, constant supply by sea, and the will to endure years of endemic warfare.\"\n\n\nThe three men look at you, waiting.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Don Luis says carefully, \"six thousand men with cannons can almost certainly take Salé. The walls are medieval. The garrison is small. The corsairs will flee or die. But holding Salé requires committing to a permanent presence on the African coast. Garrison troops. Regular supply ships. The will to fight off relief attempts that may come for years.\"\n\n\n\"The Portuguese manage it at Ceuta,\" Don Pedro observes. \"With perhaps five hundred men in the garrison, reinforced when necessary. But Ceuta guards the Strait. Salé guards... a river mouth and a stretch of empty coast.\"\n\n\nCommander de Solís speaks up. \"Salé guards our shipping lanes to Constantinople and Africa. If we hold it, no corsair sails from that port. Ever again.\"\n\n\nA long pause.\n\n\n\"The question, Your Majesty,\" Don Luis concludes, \"is whether this is a raid—burn the ships, spike the harbor, withdraw—or a conquest. A raid requires six thousand men for one summer. A conquest requires... commitment.\""

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed raid feasibility against civilian punishment complexities and medieval precedent.\n\nThe player is asking about conducting a punitive raid rather than a permanent conquest. This is actually historically quite plausible - there were many such raids in the medieval period. Let me think through the logistics and the question about punishment for pirates.\n\nHistorically:\n1. Raids on corsair ports were common - the Spanish bombarded Salé in 1628, the French in 1629\n2. Punitive expeditions were a standard response to piracy\n3. The punishment for piracy was typically death - hanging was the standard\n4. Selling captured pirates into slavery was also practiced, though this raises some interesting moral questions\n\nFor the 15th century context:\n- Piracy was considered a capital offense throughout Christendom\n- Pirates were often hanged without trial\n- Captured corsairs could be enslaved - this was common practice\n- The inhabitants of Salé aren't all pirates though - there are merchants, fishermen, craftsmen, women, children\n\nI need to be careful here. The player is asking about punishing \"those living in Salé\" - but that's the whole population, not just the pirates. Medieval warfare did sometimes involve collective punishment, but there's a difference between:\n1. Executing captured pirates (standard practice)\n2. Enslaving corsair crews (common practice)\n3. Punishing the entire civilian population (more controversial, though it did happen)\n\nThe Masters should respond to this practically and also perhaps raise some concerns about the broader implications. They're military men, not bleeding hearts, but they also understand honor and the practicalities of warfare.\n\nLet me also think about the logistics:\n- A quick raid to destroy the port infrastructure is feasible\n- Capturing inhabitants before they flee is harder - people will scatter\n- Destroying ships, harbor facilities, and naval stores is straightforward\n- The question of what to do with captured people is more complex\n\nI should have the Masters respond practically to the military question, and then address the question about punishment with appropriate medieval context. They might note:\n1. Pirates captured in the act can be executed - this is standard\n\n\n2. Corsair crews can be enslaved or ransomed\n3. The civilian population presents a more nuanced challenge\n4. Selling Christians into Muslim slavery risks significant diplomatic complications\n5. A mass punishment might trigger a disproportionate Moroccan retaliation\n\nThe strategic considerations extend beyond immediate military objectives. Indiscriminate violence could damage future diplomatic relations and potentially unite local populations against potential Christian interventions. The Masters would likely advocate for a targeted approach focusing on neutralizing the immediate pirate threat while minimizing broader civilian harm.\n\n\nThe Masters' expressions shift—relief mixed with renewed calculation. A raid is simpler than a conquest.\n\n\nDon Pedro speaks first. \"A punitive expedition. Burn the ships, destroy the harbor works, withdraw before the Marinids can respond. Yes. This can be done.\"\n\n\nDon Luis nods slowly. \"The key is speed. Land at dawn, secure the harbor, put the corsair vessels to the torch. Destroy the arsenal, the shipyards, the naval stores. Spike any cannon. Demolish the river gates if possible—the Marinids built water gates to protect their harbor. Without those, the anchorage becomes exposed to weather and silting.\"\n\n\n\"Six thousand men is more than sufficient for a raid,\" Commander de Solís adds. \"The corsairs will not stand and fight—they are sailors, not soldiers. Most will flee inland the moment they see our fleet. The garrison, if they resist at all, will fall quickly.\"\n\n\nDon Pedro leans forward. \"The difficulty is capturing the inhabitants before they scatter. Salé has gates on the landward side. The moment our ships appear on the horizon, anyone with sense will be running for the hills. We might trap those in the harbor district, but the bulk of the population...\"\n\n\nHe shrugs. \"They will escape. Unless we land forces to encircle the city before the attack begins—which requires time and risks alerting them.\"\n\n\n\nDon Luis clears his throat at your question about punishment. The Masters exchange glances.\n\n\n\"The punishment for piracy is death, Your Majesty,\" he says flatly. \"Throughout Christendom, pirates are hanged. No trial is required—capture under arms while engaged in piracy is sufficient. The corsairs we take in the harbor, on their ships, with weapons in hand—these may be executed on the spot or brought back for public hanging. This is justice, and no Christian prince would dispute it.\"\n\n\n\"As for the crews...\" Don Pedro adds, \"enslavement is common practice. The Moors enslave our sailors when they capture them. We may do likewise. They can be put to work in the mines, the galleys, or sold.\"\n\n\nCommander de Solís shifts uncomfortably. \"Selling them in Moroccan markets, though...\"\n\n\nDon Luis shakes his head. \"That would be... complicated, Your Majesty. We would be selling Muslims to Muslims. They would simply be freed and returned to their corsair trade within a year. If we wish to profit from captives, we sell them in Christian markets—Valencia, Genoa, the Italian states. Muslim slaves fetch reasonable prices for galley service and labor.\"\n\n\n\"There is also ransom,\" Don Pedro notes. \"Corsair captains and wealthy merchants may have families willing to pay for their return. This is the custom on both sides of the sea.\"\n\n\nDon Luis raises a cautionary hand. \"But Your Majesty should understand—Salé is not merely corsairs. There are fishermen, merchants, craftsmen, women, children. The corsairs themselves may number only a few hundred. If we put the entire population to the sword or chain...\"\n\n\nHe pauses, choosing his words carefully.\n\n\n\"It would not be unjust, by the laws of war. A city that harbors pirates shares their guilt. But it would provoke a response. The Marinid Sultan—weak as he is—would have to act. The marabouts would preach jihad. Every petty lord in Morocco would feel obligated to respond to such an insult. We might find ourselves facing not one raid in retaliation, but years of attacks on our southern coasts.\"\n\n\nDon Pedro nods. \"The Portuguese learned this at Ceuta. They took the city, yes—but they have been fighting to hold it for twenty years. Not because Ceuta itself is so valuable, but because its capture became a matter of honor for the Moors.\"\n\n\n\"A punitive raid that destroys the corsair fleet, executes the pirates we catch, and withdraws—that is war. Expected. Proportionate. The Marinids may grumble, but they will not be forced to respond.\"\n\n\n\"A raid that enslaves the entire population or burns the city to ash—that becomes an insult that demands answer.\"\n\n\nCommander de Solís summarizes: \"Kill the pirates. Burn the ships. Destroy the harbor. Take what captives fall into our hands. But leave the city standing and the civilians alive. They will remember the lesson. And if they forget...\" He shrugs. \"We return and teach it again.\"\n\n\n\nDon Luis looks at you directly. \"Your Majesty, what are your orders? Shall we plan a punitive expedition against Salé for the spring sailing season?\""

Rabat is on the south bank (though in 1435 it's mostly ruins/small settlement)\n3. The user wants to land light cavalry to surround the port before the main attack\n\nThis is actually a sound tactical plan - an encirclement to prevent escape before the main assault. Let me have the Masters discuss the feasibility, the geography, the risks, etc.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Where can troops land north and south of Salé?\n- How many cavalry would be needed?\n- Risk of alerting the city before the main attack\n- Timing - landing troops a day early might give warning\n- Transporting horses by sea is difficult\n\nThe Masters should discuss this tactically and realistically.

To inquire about Salé and the coastal lords?\"\n\n\nCommander de Solís nods eagerly. \"If there are beaches suitable for landing north and south of the city—within a day's ride but far enough that the landing goes unobserved—we could put cavalry ashore in the darkness. They ride through the night, take position at dawn, and when our fleet appears on the horizon...\"\n\n\n\"The rats are already trapped,\" Don Pedro finishes.\n\n\nDon Luis strokes his beard. \"The question is horses. Transporting cavalry by sea is... difficult. Horses do not travel well in ships. They require space, fresh water, constant attention. A six-thousand-man force with significant cavalry means a larger fleet, more specialized transport vessels.\"\n\n\n\"How many cavalry would be needed for the encirclement?\" Don Pedro asks, thinking aloud. \"Salé is not a large city. If we are blocking escape routes, not fighting a battle... two hundred horse? Three hundred? Enough to establish pickets on the roads and run down anyone who tries to flee.\"\n\n\nCommander de Solís frowns. \"Three hundred horses means... perhaps five or six transport ships dedicated solely to the cavalry. Plus feed, plus grooms. It adds complexity.\"\n\n\n\"But it makes the difference between a raid that kills a few pirates and one that ends Salé as a corsair port for a generation,\" Don Luis counters. \"If the captains, the shipwrights, the navigators all escape into the hills, they rebuild within five years. If we capture them...\"\n\n\nHe leaves the implication hanging.\n\n\nDon Pedro turns to you. \"Your Majesty, this plan has merit, but we need answers to several questions before we can properly assess it.\"\n\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\n\"First: What does Commander Martín's network know about the coast near Salé? Are there suitable landing beaches to the north and south? How far from the city? What terrain lies between?\"\n\n\n\"Second: What is the true population of Salé? You said a few hundred—but that may be the corsairs alone. The city itself may hold several thousand souls. Our cavalry screen must be sized appropriately.\"\n\n\n\"Third: Can we achieve surprise? If we land cavalry a full day before the main attack, do we risk fishermen or shepherds spotting them and raising the alarm?\"\n\n\n\"Fourth: What naval forces do the corsairs possess? If they have fast galleys in the harbor, they may attempt to flee by sea the moment they see our fleet. We would need to blockade the river mouth before the assault.\"\n\n\nDon Luis adds: \"We should also consider the timing. Spring sailing season begins in April. If we wish to strike Salé, we must begin assembling forces now—quietly. The more time we have to gather intelligence and plan, the better our chances of complete success.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Shall I send word to Commander Martín to gather specific intelligence on the coast around Salé? Landing beaches, road networks, garrison strength, the number and type of corsair vessels in the harbor?\""

What factors would help or hinder intelligence gathering\n4. Realistic probability distribution\n\nLet me think about the factors:\n\nFactors favoring success:\n- Martín already has an established network in Morocco (Tangier/Tétouan)\n- He has Fernando (Ahmad al-Zarqali), a converted Moor with scholarly connections\n- The Marinid dynasty is weak and fragmented - information flows more freely\n- Salé is a commercial port with traders who might talk\n- Castile has recent experience with Moorish territories (Granada)\n\nFactors limiting success:\n- Salé is not where Martín is currently based (he's in Tangier/Tétouan area)\n- Asking specific military questions might arouse suspicion\n- The corsairs themselves would be wary of spies\n- Distance and time constraints\n- Religious/cultural barriers\n\nThe intelligence gathering should cover:\n1.

Assembling transport vessels, ensuring the cavalry horses are in good condition, stockpiling naval stores. Nothing that would arouse suspicion, but nothing that wastes time either.\"\n\n\nThe Masters rise, bowing. \"By your leave, Your Majesty. We will await Commander Martín's intelligence before reconvening.\"\n\n\n\nChaos Roll: Commander Martín's Intelligence Gathering on Salé\n\n\nContext:\nCommander Martín operates an established intelligence network based in the Tangier/Tétouan area of Morocco. He has Fernando (Ahmad al-Zarqali), a converted Moor with scholarly connections, supporting him. The Marinid Sultanate is weak and fragmented, which may make information easier to obtain—or may mean that reliable information is harder to verify amid competing local powers.\n\n\nFactors Favoring Success:\n\n\nEstablished network already operating in Morocco\n\nFernando's scholarly connections provide cultural access\n\nMarinid weakness means looser central control, more people willing to talk\n\nSalé is a commercial port—merchants, traders, and sailors gossip\n\nCastilian experience with Moorish territories (Granada) informs tradecraft\n\nSeveral months available for careful intelligence work\n\n\nFactors Limiting Success:\n\n\nMartín is based in Tangier/Tétouan, not Salé—must extend network or travel\n\nSpecific military questions (beaches, defenses, garrison) may arouse suspicion\n\nCorsairs are naturally wary of strangers asking about their operations\n\nReligious and cultural barriers limit access to certain circles\n\nInformation must travel back to Castile, risking interception or distortion\n\nCompeting local powers may provide conflicting or deliberately false information\n\n\nIntelligence Objectives:\n\n\nLanding beaches north and south of Salé suitable for cavalry\n\nTrue population of Salé (corsairs vs. civilians)\n\nTerrain and road networks around the city\n\nCorsair naval strength (number and type of vessels)\n\nGarrison strength and quality\n\nHarbor defenses and fortifications\n\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-5\nDisaster: Martín's inquiries are detected. One or more of his agents is captured or killed. The corsairs are now alerted that someone is asking questions about Salé's defenses. Any future raid loses the element of surprise. Martín himself may need to flee Morocco.\n6-12\nCompromised Intelligence: Martín obtains information, but some of it is deliberately false—planted by suspicious corsairs or local rivals. He cannot determine which details are reliable. Acting on this intelligence risks walking into a trap or finding conditions very different than expected.\n13-25\nIncomplete Intelligence: Martín gathers partial information. He can report on some objectives (perhaps 2-3 of the 6), but significant gaps remain. Landing beaches or garrison strength or corsair naval forces remain unknown. Planning must proceed with considerable uncertainty.\n26-45\nBasic Intelligence: Martín provides adequate information on most objectives, but details are thin. Landing beaches exist but their exact suitability is unclear. Population estimates are rough. Corsair vessel count is approximate. Enough to plan a raid, but with significant margins for error.\n46-65\nSolid Intelligence: Martín delivers reliable information on all major objectives. Landing beaches are identified with reasonable descriptions. Population and garrison estimates are credible. Corsair fleet is enumerated. Road networks are mapped. A competent raid can be planned with confidence.\n66-80\nGood Intelligence: Martín exceeds expectations. Detailed information on all objectives, plus additional useful details—patrol schedules, the names of corsair captains, which local leaders might be bribed or intimidated, seasonal patterns of corsair activity. Planning can account for contingencies.\n81-90\nExcellent Intelligence: Martín's network penetrates deeply. Comprehensive information includes defensive weaknesses, internal divisions among the corsairs, a reliable contact inside Salé willing to provide updates, and precise details about harbor fortifications. The raid can be planned with surgical precision.\n91-97\nExceptional Intelligence: Martín recruits an agent within Salé itself—perhaps a disgruntled sailor, a merchant with grudges, or a slave seeking freedom. This agent can provide real-time information and potentially assist during the raid (opening a gate, signaling the fleet, guiding cavalry). A significant operational advantage.\n98-100\nWindfall: Beyond military intelligence, Martín uncovers something unexpected—perhaps evidence of a planned corsair raid on Castilian shipping that can be intercepted, or intelligence about Marinid political weakness that could be exploited, or contact with a local lord willing to look the other way during the raid in exchange for future consideration. Strategic opportunities beyond the immediate operation.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

Landing beaches north and south of Salé\n2. True population of Salé (corsairs vs. civilians)\n3. Terrain and road networks around the city\n4. Corsair naval strength (number and type of vessels)\n5. Garrison strength and quality\n6. Harbor defenses and fortifications\n\nThe information should be solid but not perfect - some margins for error, some details that are approximate rather than precise.\n\n\nTwo and a half months pass. Winter deepens, then slowly begins to release its grip. The work of the kingdom continues—Lucia's pregnancy progresses well, the Constantinople settlement convoys are prepared for spring sailing, and the administrative reforms inch toward completion.\n\n\nThen, in late February 1436, a weathered messenger arrives at Segovia bearing a sealed packet from Commander Martín.\n\n\n\nYou break the seal in your private study. The report is written in Martín's careful hand, with annotations from Fernando where his scholarly contacts provided information.\n\n\n\nTo His Most Christian Majesty Juan II,\n\n\nYour Majesty requested intelligence regarding Salé and its environs. I have spent these months extending our network southward from Tétouan, cultivating contacts among merchants who trade along the coast, and—through Fernando's scholarly connections—gaining access to travelers who know the Bou Regreg well.\n\n\nWhat follows is reliable, though I cannot vouch for every detail. The Moors are suspicious by nature, and some of what I report comes secondhand.\n\n\n\nLANDING BEACHES\n\n\nNorth of Salé: A sandy beach exists approximately four leagues north of the city, near the mouth of a seasonal stream. Local fishermen use it to land small boats. The beach is broad enough to disembark cavalry, though the surf can be treacherous in poor weather. From this beach, a track runs south through low scrubland to the main road entering Salé from the north. Cavalry could reach the northern gates within three to four hours of hard riding.\n\n\nSouth of Salé: The coast south of the Bou Regreg is rockier, but a suitable landing site exists approximately three leagues south, where a small cove provides shelter from the prevailing winds. From there, the terrain is more difficult—sandy hills and patches of scrub forest—but a determined force could reach the southern approaches to Rabat (the settlement on the south bank of the river, opposite Salé) within four to five hours.\n\n\nAssessment: Both landings are feasible but not ideal. The northern beach is better for cavalry operations. The southern landing would require more time and offers less certain terrain.\n\n\n\nPOPULATION\n\n\nSalé proper (north bank of the Bou Regreg): Perhaps 4,000-5,000 souls in total. This includes merchants, craftsmen, fishermen, scholars, and their families. Salé has a reputation as a city of learning and piety—mosques, madrasas, Sufi lodges. The corsairs are tolerated here, but many residents view them with distaste.\n\n\nRabat (south bank, called \"New Salé\" by some): Much smaller, perhaps 1,000-1,500. More rough in character. This is where the corsairs actually base their operations—the kasbah on the south bank overlooks the river mouth and provides their stronghold.\n\n\nThe Corsairs themselves: Fernando's contacts estimate 300-400 active corsair sailors and fighters, plus perhaps 100-150 associated craftsmen (shipwrights, ropemakers, sailmakers). In a crisis, they might arm 500 men capable of fighting. Most live in Rabat, not Salé proper.\n\n\nAssessment: The corsair threat is concentrated on the south bank. Salé itself is a civilian city that profits from but does not directly participate in piracy.\n\n\n\nTERRAIN AND ROADS\n\n\nThree main routes lead from Salé:\n\n\nNorth road: Toward Kenitra and eventually Tangier. This is the route cavalry from the northern beach would need to block.\n\nEast road: Toward Meknes and Fez, into the interior. The primary escape route for anyone fleeing inland.\n\nSouth road: Crosses the river (by boat—there is no permanent bridge) to Rabat, then continues toward Casablanca.\n\n\nThe Bou Regreg river is the critical geographic feature. It is too deep to ford near the mouth. Anyone fleeing from Salé to Rabat (or vice versa) must use boats. If we control the river, we divide the two settlements.\n\n\n\nCORSAIR NAVAL STRENGTH\n\n\nFernando cultivated a merchant who trades in naval stores. His estimate:\n\n\n8-12 seagoing vessels capable of Atlantic operations (mixture of captured European ships and purpose-built corsair craft)\n\n15-20 smaller coastal boats (fishing vessels, lighters, river craft)\n\nPerhaps 4-6 galleys or galiots suitable for raiding\n\n\nTotal fighting ships: 12-18 vessels of varying quality\n\n\nThe corsair fleet is not concentrated in one place. Some vessels may be at sea when we arrive. Others shelter in the protected harbor behind the river gates.\n\n\nAssessment: We cannot guarantee catching the entire fleet in harbor. A naval blockade of the river mouth before the assault would prevent escape by sea.\n\n\n\nGARRISON AND DEFENSES\n\n\nSalé's walls: Marinid construction, 13th-14th century. Stone and rammed earth. In reasonable repair but not modernized for gunpowder warfare. No artillery bastions. The walls would not withstand sustained cannon bombardment.\n\n\nThe Kasbah (Rabat, south bank): Older fortification overlooking the river mouth. This is the corsairs' stronghold. Better maintained than Salé's walls, with some cannon mounted to cover the river entrance. Perhaps 6-10 guns of varying age and quality.\n\n\nGarrison: No professional military garrison in the traditional sense. The corsairs themselves are the fighting force. In an emergency, perhaps 500 armed men could be mustered from both banks—but these are sailors, not soldiers. They will fight to defend their ships and homes, but they are not trained for pitched battle against professional troops.\n\n\nThe River Gates: Bab el-Mrissa is a fortified water gate controlling access to the protected inner harbor. Ships must pass through this gate to reach safety. If we can seize or destroy this gate, the corsair fleet is trapped in the open river.\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS\n\n\nThe Marinid Sultan in Fez takes little interest in Salé. The city pays nominal tribute but governs itself. Local power rests with a council of merchants and religious notables who tolerate the corsairs because they bring wealth.\n\n\nThe corsairs themselves are not unified. Several captains compete for dominance. There is no single leader who commands all of them.\n\n\nRelations between Salé (pious, scholarly) and Rabat (rough, corsair-dominated) are... strained. The respectable families of Salé would not mourn if the corsairs of Rabat were eliminated, though they would never say so openly.\n\n\nYour servant,\nMartín de Córdoba\n\n\n\nYou set down the report. Solid intelligence—enough to plan a raid with confidence, though some details remain approximate. The corsairs number perhaps 500 fighting men. Their fleet consists of 12-18 seagoing vessels. The defenses are medieval, vulnerable to cannon. The population is divided between two settlements on opposite banks of a river.\n\n\nAnd the respectable citizens of Salé, it seems, might not weep too loudly if their troublesome neighbors across the water were put to the sword.\n\n\nThe Masters await your summons."

Appoint a commander for the Salé raid\n3. Goals: eliminate corsairs, spare civilians, deliver a warning\n4. Use 300 cavalry landed north of Salé to block escape\n5. Attack in spring 1436\n6. Ask if there are questions\n\nI should have the Masters respond to this, discuss commander options, raise practical questions about the operation, and set up the planning. This is a military planning session, so I should have the NPCs ask intelligent questions about logistics, timing, rules of engagement, etc.\n\nKey questions they might raise:\n- Who should command? (This is important - the player said they want to appoint a commander but hasn't named one)\n- What about the southern approach/Rabat? The intelligence says corsairs are based on the SOUTH bank (Rabat), not the north bank (Salé). The cavalry landing north would block escape from Salé, but the corsairs are in Rabat.\n- Naval blockade - how to prevent corsairs from escaping by sea?\n- Rules of engagement - how do we distinguish corsairs from civilians?\n- What to do with the kasbah on the south bank?\n- Timeline - spring 1436 is soon, is there enough time to prepare?\n- Fleet composition needed\n- What about the river gates (Bab el-Mrissa)?\n\nI should also note that the player may have slightly misread the intelligence - the corsairs are based in RABAT (south bank), not Salé (north bank). Salé is the pious scholarly city. So landing cavalry north of Salé would block escape from the civilian city, not the corsair stronghold. The Masters should gently point this out.\n\nLet me have the Masters respond professionally, raise these questions, and discuss commander options.\n\n\nThe Masters gather within the week, their expressions keen with anticipation. Word has spread among their inner circles that a campaign is coming—the first offensive action against the Moors since Granada fell.\n\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán, Don Pedro González de Padilla, and Commander Fernando de Solís take their seats across from you. Martín's intelligence report has been copied and shared among them.\n\n\nDon Pedro speaks first, his finger tracing the rough map that accompanies the report.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, before we discuss commanders, I must raise a point about the cavalry landing.\" He taps the map. \"Commander Martín's intelligence is clear: the corsairs are based in Rabat, on the south bank of the Bou Regreg. Salé proper—on the north bank—is the scholarly city. The respectable merchants. The mosques and madrasas.\"\n\n\nHe looks up. \"If we land cavalry north of Salé, we block escape from the civilian population. The corsairs we seek are across the river, in the kasbah of Rabat. They would flee south, not north.\"\n\n\nDon Luis nods. \"The southern landing is more difficult—rockier coast, harder terrain—but that is where we must place our net if we wish to trap the corsairs themselves. The northern landing might still be useful to prevent any corsairs in Salé from escaping, and to secure the north bank... but the main prey is across the water.\"\n\n\nCommander de Solís studies the map. \"Perhaps we need both landings. Three hundred horse total—two hundred to the south to block the Rabat escape routes, one hundred to the north to secure Salé and prevent anyone crossing the river to warn the southern bank.\"\n\n\n\nDon Luis clears his throat. \"On the matter of command, Your Majesty. This is a joint operation—crown forces and Military Order knights working together. The commander must be someone all parties will follow without question.\"\n\n\nHe pauses delicately. \"A crown officer commanding Order knights may cause... friction. An Order Master commanding crown troops raises similar concerns. And none of us\"—he gestures to himself and his fellow Masters—\"can easily leave our duties for a campaign of several months.\"\n\n\nDon Pedro offers: \"There are several options. First, Your Majesty could appoint a senior crown military officer—perhaps someone from the War Academy, or an experienced captain from the Granada campaigns. The Orders would accept royal authority if the appointment is clear and the man competent.\"\n\n\n\"Second,\" Commander de Solís adds, \"one of the Order commanders who served in Constantinople might be suitable. They have experience with amphibious operations now, and commanding mixed forces. Master Sotomayor remains in the East, but there are others...\"\n\n\nDon Luis raises a third option, carefully: \"Or Your Majesty might consider dividing command. A crown admiral for the naval operation—the blockade, the landing, the bombardment. An Order commander for the ground forces—the cavalry encirclement and the assault on the kasbah. They would coordinate, but each would command their own element.\"\n\n\n\nDon Pedro returns to practical matters. \"Several questions remain, Your Majesty:\"\n\n\n\"First—the naval blockade. Commander Martín reports some corsair vessels may be at sea when we arrive. How do we prevent those in harbor from fleeing when they see our fleet? We need fast ships to seal the river mouth before the main force arrives.\"\n\n\n\"Second—the river gates. Bab el-Mrissa controls access to the inner harbor. If the corsairs retreat behind it, they gain time to scuttle their ships or prepare defenses. Do we attempt to seize it intact, or simply bombard it?\"\n\n\n\"Third—distinguishing corsairs from civilians. Your Majesty wishes to spare the innocent, which is just and wise. But in the chaos of an assault, how do our men know who is a corsair and who is a fisherman? The corsairs will not wear uniforms. Some may try to blend with the population.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth—Rabat's kasbah. This is the corsair stronghold. It has cannon covering the river. Do we land troops to assault it directly, or bombard it from the water first?\"\n\n\n\"Fifth—prisoners. You mentioned executing pirates and possibly enslaving crews. What are the specific orders? Do we hang captains on the spot? Bring them back for trial? What of those who surrender?\"\n\n\nCommander de Solís adds a final question: \"And sixth—timing. Spring 1436 is perhaps six to eight weeks away. Is there sufficient time to assemble the fleet, load the cavalry, coordinate with Portugal if we wish their support, and sail for Morocco? Or do we accept a smaller, faster operation?\"\n\n\nThe three men wait, ready to receive your answers and begin detailed planning."

Unpredictable maritime conditions and complex military coordination might disrupt the carefully planned assault. Despite overwhelming numerical superiority and strategic advantages, the inherent chaos of medieval warfare introduces significant uncertainty into the mission's outcome.\n\n\nThe Masters nod with evident satisfaction. This is clear, practical guidance.\n\n\nDon Luis speaks first. \"For the ground commander, I would suggest Sir Rodrigo de Cárdenas—a knight-commander of Santiago who served with distinction at Granada and accompanied the Constantinople expedition. He is experienced in amphibious landings now, commands respect among all three Orders, and has the temperament for the kind of disciplined operation Your Majesty describes. He is not so senior as to cause political difficulties, but capable enough that none will question his orders.\"\n\n\nDon Pedro and Commander de Solís both nod agreement. \"Cárdenas is a good choice,\" Don Pedro confirms. \"Methodical. Not given to rashness or unnecessary cruelty.\"\n\n\n\"For the Portuguese naval commander,\" Don Luis continues, \"we should write to Admiral Ataíde in Seville. He can recommend a captain from the combined fleet—someone who knows Atlantic waters and has experience with Moorish coasts. The Portuguese have been sailing these waters for decades.\"\n\n\nCommander de Solís makes a note. \"I will see to the Moorish translators. We have converted Moors in service throughout Granada—men who served the crown during the conquest and proved their loyalty. A half-dozen who speak both Castilian and Arabic fluently should suffice.\"\n\n\n\nDon Pedro rises and moves to the map. \"Then let us summarize the plan for Sir Rodrigo:\"\n\n\n\"The fleet sails from Seville—crown ships, Military Order vessels, Portuguese squadron. Six thousand troops, three hundred cavalry in transport ships. Moorish translators attached to the command staff.\"\n\n\n\"Fast galleys seal the river mouth at dawn, preventing escape by sea. The main fleet appears on the horizon.\"\n\n\n\"Cavalry lands the night before—two hundred to the south to block escape from Rabat, one hundred to the north to secure Salé and prevent river crossings.\"\n\n\n\"Under flag of parley, we demand surrender. The translators make clear: we seek only the corsairs. Those who lay down arms and submit to judgment may live. Those who resist die.\"\n\n\n\"The kasbah at Rabat is the primary target. Bombardment first, then assault if necessary. The corsair ships in harbor are burned. The naval arsenal and shipyards are destroyed.\"\n\n\n\"Pirates identified with reasonable certainty—particularly those found in the kasbah, on corsair vessels, or bearing arms—are hanged. Their crews are enslaved. Civilians who did not resist are released with a warning.\"\n\n\n\"The commander has discretion to adapt as circumstances require. The goal is elimination of the corsair threat, not conquest or massacre.\"\n\n\nHe looks to you. \"Is this your intent, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\n\nAfter your confirmation, the Masters depart to begin preparations. The operation will launch when ready—likely late spring 1436, once the cavalry transports are assembled and the Portuguese coordination is complete.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll: The Salé Expedition (Spring 1436)\n\n\nOperation Summary:\n\n\n6,000 Castilian and Military Order troops\n\n~300 cavalry for encirclement (200 south, 100 north)\n\nPortuguese-commanded fleet with cannon\n\nCommander: Sir Rodrigo de Cárdenas (Santiago)\n\nObjective: Destroy corsair fleet and facilities, execute/enslave pirates, spare civilians\n\n\nFactors Favoring Success:\n\n\nOverwhelming numerical superiority (6,000 vs ~500 corsair fighters)\n\nNaval superiority with cannon against medieval fortifications\n\nSolid intelligence on terrain, defenses, and enemy strength\n\nDual cavalry landing to block escape routes\n\nProfessional soldiers against sailors fighting out of their element\n\nCorsairs have no unified command—competing captains\n\nCivilian population of Salé unlikely to aid corsairs\n\nDemand for surrender may cause some to yield without fighting\n\nPortuguese naval expertise on familiar waters\n\nExperienced commander with amphibious operation background\n\nMoorish translators to communicate intentions clearly\n\n\nFactors Against Success:\n\n\nAmphibious operations are inherently complex and risky\n\nCavalry transport by sea is difficult—horses may arrive in poor condition\n\nSouthern landing site has challenging terrain\n\nSome corsair vessels may be at sea and escape\n\nKasbah has cannon covering the river approach\n\nWeather and sea conditions are unpredictable\n\nDistinguishing pirates from civilians in the chaos of battle\n\nCornered men fight desperately for their lives\n\nCoordination required between multiple independent forces\n\nUnknown factors—the fog of war\n\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-3\nDisaster: A major storm strikes during the landing operations, scattering the fleet. Ships are lost, including cavalry transports. The operation must be aborted with significant casualties and loss of materiel. The corsairs are warned and will be prepared for any future attempt. Castilian prestige suffers a severe blow.\n4-8\nSerious Setback: The southern cavalry landing fails—rough seas, rocky coast, horses injured or drowned. Only the northern force lands successfully. The corsairs of Rabat escape inland before the assault begins. The fleet destroys some ships in harbor and bombards the kasbah, but the corsair leadership and most crews flee to fight another day. Partial success at best.\n9-15\nCostly Victory: The operation succeeds, but at significant cost. Perhaps the kasbah's guns sink a ship or two before being silenced. Perhaps the cavalry arrives late and some corsairs escape. Perhaps resistance is fiercer than expected and casualties mount. The corsair fleet is destroyed, but 200-400 Castilian dead, and some notable captains escape to rebuild elsewhere.\n16-25\nFlawed Success: The military objectives are achieved—fleet burned, kasbah taken, pirates executed—but complications arise. Perhaps civilians are killed in the confusion despite efforts to spare them. Perhaps a Portuguese captain exceeds his orders. Perhaps the Marinid Sultan sends an angry embassy. Political consequences require careful management.\n26-40\nAdequate Success: The operation proceeds largely as planned with typical friction of war. Cavalry encirclement is partially effective—most corsairs are trapped, but some escape through gaps or by hiding among civilians. The corsair fleet is destroyed (10-14 ships burned). 150-250 pirates executed, 200-300 enslaved. Some civilian casualties despite precautions. The warning is delivered clearly. Salé will not soon harbor pirates again.\n41-60\nSolid Success: The operation executes well. Both cavalry forces land successfully and establish blocking positions. The corsairs are caught between the encirclement and the fleet. Resistance at the kasbah collapses after bombardment. The corsair fleet is destroyed (12-16 ships). 200-350 pirates executed, 250-400 enslaved. Civilian casualties are minimal. Sir Rodrigo's discipline holds—the honest citizens of Salé are left with their lives and property, and a clear understanding of Castilian justice.\n61-75\nGood Success: Better than expected. The demand for surrender causes significant defections—some corsair crews abandon their captains rather than face certain death. The kasbah falls quickly. Nearly the entire corsair fleet is caught in harbor and destroyed (15-18 ships). 250-400 pirates executed, 300-450 enslaved, including several notable captains. Civilian population is successfully separated from combatants. The operation becomes a model for future amphibious raids.\n76-85\nExcellent Success: The encirclement is nearly perfect. The corsairs, seeing no escape by land or sea, surrender in large numbers after token resistance. The kasbah's guns are silenced before they can do significant damage. The entire corsair fleet is destroyed or captured. 300-450 pirates executed (including all major captains), 400-500 enslaved. Minimal Castilian casualties. The civilian population, treated with scrupulous fairness, spreads word along the coast that Castile punishes pirates but spares the innocent.\n86-93\nOutstanding Success: Everything aligns. The cavalry lands undetected, the blockade is airtight, the bombardment is devastating. The corsairs panic and their resistance collapses. Several captains are captured alive for public execution in Castile. The corsair fleet is annihilated—not a single vessel escapes. The Moorish translators' message spreads: Castile offers mercy to those who reject piracy, death to those who practice it. Coastal communities along Morocco take notice. Some may quietly approach Castilian agents about ensuring they are not mistaken for corsair havens.\n94-97\nExceptional Victory: Beyond military success, a political opportunity emerges. Perhaps a local Moroccan lord, disgusted by the corsairs or fearful of Castilian power, offers quiet cooperation. Perhaps captured documents reveal corsair connections that can be exploited. Perhaps the Sultan's representative arrives not to protest but to privately thank Castile for solving a problem the Marinids could not. The operation yields benefits beyond the immediate objective.\n98-100\nHistoric Triumph: The Salé raid becomes legendary. Total destruction of the corsair threat, minimal Castilian losses, perfect separation of pirates from civilians. The operation is studied by military commanders across Europe. Captured corsair wealth partially offsets the expedition's cost. Most significantly, the demonstration of Castilian naval reach and disciplined justice causes ripples throughout the western Mediterranean—other corsair havens grow nervous, while legitimate merchants gain confidence in Castilian-protected waters. The crown's reputation as defender of Christian commerce is powerfully enhanced.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

Those would be separate rolls.\n\nLet me narrate an exceptional victory for the Salé raid - the military operation goes perfectly, with some additional opportunity emerging, but I'll keep the focus on what actually happened during the raid itself.\n\n\nLate Spring 1436\n\n\nThe fleet departs Seville in late April—forty-two vessels carrying six thousand soldiers, three hundred cavalry horses, and enough cannon to reduce a medieval fortress to rubble. Sir Rodrigo de Cárdenas commands from the flagship Santa María de la Victoria. The Portuguese captain, Álvaro Gonçalves, commands the naval squadron with quiet competence.\n\n\nThe crossing is smooth. God, it seems, favors the expedition.\n\n\n\nThe Night Landing\n\n\nOn the night before the assault, under a moonless sky, the cavalry transports separate from the main fleet.\n\n\nThe northern force—one hundred horsemen under Captain Diego de Sotomayor—lands on the beach four leagues north of Salé without incident. The horses, after days confined in rolling ships, are restless but sound. By midnight, they are riding south through the scrubland.\n\n\nThe southern force faces the greater challenge. Captain Hernán de Villena leads two hundred cavalry toward the rocky cove three leagues south of Rabat. The landing is difficult—boats scrape against submerged rocks, horses must be coaxed through chest-deep surf—but by sheer determination, the force assembles on the beach before dawn. They ride north through the sandy hills, reaching their blocking positions just as the eastern sky begins to lighten.\n\n\nThe trap is set.\n\n\n\nThe Assault\n\n\nDawn breaks over the Atlantic. The Castilian fleet appears on the horizon like a forest of masts.\n\n\nIn Salé and Rabat, the alarm spreads. Bells ring. Men shout. The corsairs scramble for their ships—and discover Portuguese galleys already sealing the river mouth, their guns trained on any vessel that approaches.\n\n\nSome try to flee by land. To the north, they find Captain Sotomayor's cavalry blocking the road, lances leveled. To the south, Captain Villena's horsemen have cut every path from Rabat into the interior. A few desperate men try to slip through on foot, through the scrub and ravines. Most are ridden down within hours.\n\n\nSir Rodrigo brings the fleet to anchor within cannon range of the kasbah. Under flag of parley, a boat approaches the shore bearing Moorish translators.\n\n\nThe message is clear: Surrender the pirates. The innocent will not be harmed. Those who resist will die.\n\n\n\nThe Collapse\n\n\nWhat happens next exceeds all expectations.\n\n\nThe corsairs, seeing no escape, do not unite for a desperate last stand. Instead, they turn on each other. Old rivalries, long suppressed, explode in the shadow of annihilation.\n\n\nTwo corsair captains attempt to bargain—offering to surrender their rivals in exchange for their own lives. Sir Rodrigo, following your instructions, refuses. Justice will not be purchased with betrayal.\n\n\nBut the chaos spreads. Corsair crews, seeing their captains squabbling while Castilian cannon are run out, begin surrendering in groups. Some throw down their weapons and wade into the surf toward the Castilian boats, begging for mercy. Others barricade themselves in the kasbah, but their numbers dwindle by the hour.\n\n\nThe kasbah's guns fire twice. One ball splashes harmlessly in the river. The other strikes a transport ship's rigging, injuring three sailors. Then the Castilian bombardment begins, and within an hour, the kasbah's seaward wall is breached and its guns silenced.\n\n\nBy midday, organized resistance has ended.\n\n\n\nThe Reckoning\n\n\nSir Rodrigo's discipline holds. The soldiers, well-paid and well-led, do not run amok.\n\n\nThe translators move through Rabat, separating corsairs from civilians. The process is methodical: those found in the kasbah, on corsair vessels, or identified by multiple witnesses as pirates are bound and marched to the harbor. Those who can demonstrate they are fishermen, craftsmen, or merchants—and whom no one accuses—are gathered in the main square and held under guard, but not harmed.\n\n\nThe honest citizens of Salé, across the river, watch from their walls. No Castilian soldier enters their city. The message is unmistakable: this justice is precise.\n\n\nThe Executions\n\n\nBy late afternoon, the gallows are erected on the Rabat waterfront, visible from both banks of the river.\n\n\nThree hundred and forty-seven men are hanged over the course of two days. Every corsair captain is among them—including Yusuf al-Rais, the most notorious raider on this stretch of coast, who personally commanded attacks that enslaved over two hundred Christian sailors in the past five years. He dies cursing, unrepentant.\n\n\nFour hundred and twelve men—corsair crews, dockworkers who loaded stolen cargo, shipwrights who built raiding vessels—are chained and loaded onto transports. They will be sold in Valencia and Genoa. The proceeds will partially offset the expedition's costs.\n\n\nThe Fleet\n\n\nSeventeen corsair vessels are captured in harbor—more than Commander Martín's intelligence suggested. Some were visiting from other ports, caught by misfortune in Salé when the Castilian fleet appeared.\n\n\nAll seventeen are burned. The flames rise high enough to be seen from Salé's minarets. The naval arsenal is demolished. The shipyards are torn apart, their timber stocks set ablaze. The protected inner harbor is blocked with the hulks of scuttled ships.\n\n\nIt will take years to rebuild what is destroyed in a single day.\n\n\n\nThe Message\n\n\nBefore withdrawing, Sir Rodrigo summons the notables of Salé—the merchants, the scholars, the religious leaders who govern the respectable city on the north bank.\n\n\nThey come reluctantly, fearfully, across the river to meet the Christian commander amid the smoke and ashes of Rabat.\n\n\nSir Rodrigo, through the translators, delivers your message:\n\n\n\"His Majesty King Juan of Castile bears no quarrel with honest men. The merchants of Salé may trade. The fishermen may fish. The scholars may study. But those who harbor pirates, who provision their ships, who buy their stolen goods—these men share the pirates' guilt and will share the pirates' fate.\"\n\n\n\"If corsairs return to these waters, Castile will return as well. And the next time, we will not trouble to distinguish the guilty from those who sheltered them.\"\n\n\nThe notables bow. They understand.\n\n\n\nThe Captured Documents\n\n\nAs the fleet prepares to withdraw, Sir Rodrigo sends a packet to you under his personal seal, separate from the main dispatches.\n\n\nAmong the captured materials from the kasbah, his men discovered a locked chest belonging to Yusuf al-Rais. Inside were records—meticulous records, as it turns out, for the old corsair was nothing if not organized.\n\n\nThe records detail ten years of raids: ships taken, cargo seized, crews enslaved. But more importantly, they document transactions. Names of merchants in Tétouan, Tangier, and Fez who purchased stolen goods. Names of suppliers who provisioned corsair vessels. Names of officials who took bribes to look the other way.\n\n\nA map of corsair collaboration across northern Morocco, written in the corsairs' own hand.\n\n\nSir Rodrigo notes in his cover letter: \"Your Majesty may find these documents useful for purposes beyond this expedition. I have shared them with no one else.\"\n\n\n\nThe Return\n\n\nThe fleet withdraws in good order in early June. Castilian casualties total forty-three dead—mostly from the kasbah assault—and perhaps twice that number wounded.\n\n\nThe expedition returns to Seville in triumph. Church bells ring. The enslaved corsairs are paraded through the streets before being sent to the slave markets.\n\n\nWord spreads along the Atlantic coast, from Lisbon to Tangier to the ports of the Mediterranean: Castile has reached out across the sea and crushed a corsair nest with surgical precision, sparing the innocent and destroying the guilty.\n\n\nThe honest merchants of a dozen ports breathe easier. The corsairs of a dozen others grow nervous.\n\n\n\nSummary of Results:\n\n\nCorsairs executed: 347 (including all major captains)\n\nCorsairs enslaved: 412\n\nCorsair vessels destroyed: 17\n\nNaval arsenal and shipyards: Demolished\n\nCastilian casualties: 43 dead, ~90 wounded\n\nCivilian casualties: Minimal (fewer than 20)\n\nCaptured intelligence: Extensive documentation of corsair networks and collaborators across northern Morocco\n\n\n\nThe raid itself is a complete success—arguably the most successful Castilian naval operation in living memory.\n\n\nHow the wider world reacts—the Marinid Sultan, the Portuguese, the other Moroccan powers, the merchants of the Mediterranean—remains to be seen."

A common soldier might earn 2-3 florins per month, so let's say average 2.5 florins/month × 2 months × 6,000 = 30,000 florins\n- Sailor pay: 42 vessels, average crew of maybe 30-40 per ship = ~1,500 sailors, at similar rates = ~7,500 florins\n- Food and supplies: 7,500 men for 2 months, plus horses. Food might cost 0.5-1 florin per man per month. Let's say 15,000 florins\n- Horse transport and care: 300 horses, specialized transport, fodder = maybe 3,000-5,000 florins\n- Ammunition and naval stores: Cannon balls, powder, repairs = 5,000-10,000 florins\n- Ship wear and tear/repairs: 5,000-10,000 florins\n- Miscellaneous: 5,000 florins\n\nTotal costs: roughly 70,000-90,000 florins\n\n**Revenue:**\n- 412 enslaved corsairs: Muslim galley slaves in the 15th century Mediterranean sold for roughly 25-50 florins each. Let's say average 30-35 florins each = 12,000-15,000 florins\n\n\n- Captured goods from the kasbah might add 5,000-20,000 florins, though ransom potential seems limited\n\nWhile the direct financial recovery falls short of expedition expenses, the strategic advantages of disrupting piracy and securing trade routes provide substantial long-term economic benefits that outweigh the immediate monetary costs.\n\n\nDiego de Daza is summoned to your study upon the fleet's return. He arrives with ledgers already prepared—the man has been tracking expenses since the operation began.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he begins, settling into his chair and opening his accounts. \"The Salé expedition was not inexpensive, but neither was it ruinous. And the returns are better than I initially projected.\"\n\n\nHe runs his finger down the columns.\n\n\n\nEXPEDITION COSTS\n\nItem\nAmount (Florins)\nSoldier wages (6,000 men, 2 months)\n30,000\nSailor wages (42 vessels, ~1,400 men)\n7,000\nProvisions (troops, sailors, horses)\n14,000\nCavalry transport (specialized ships, fodder, grooms)\n4,500\nGunpowder and ammunition\n6,000\nNaval stores and repairs\n5,500\nBounties for wounded, death payments to families\n2,800\nMiscellaneous (translators, intelligence, coordination)\n1,200\nTOTAL COSTS\n71,000\n\n\nDiego looks up. \"The Portuguese contributed their squadron at their own expense—part of the maritime union arrangements. Without that, we would have spent another eight to ten thousand florins on additional vessels and crews.\"\n\n\nHe turns to the next page.\n\n\n\nEXPEDITION REVENUES\n\n\n\"The enslaved corsairs were sold in Valencia and Genoa, as planned. The market was... favorable. Word of the raid preceded the sale, and buyers were eager to acquire men from the infamous Salé rovers.\"\n\nItem\nAmount (Florins)\nSale of 412 corsair slaves (average 38 fl each)\n15,650\nCaptured goods from kasbah (coin, trade goods, weapons)\n8,200\nCaptured navigational charts and instruments (sold to Portuguese)\n1,400\nPersonal effects of executed captains (jewelry, fine goods)\n2,100\nSalvageable materials from corsair vessels (before burning)\n1,850\nTOTAL REVENUES\n29,200\n\n\nDiego sets down his quill. \"The direct recovery is approximately twenty-nine thousand florins against seventy-one thousand in costs. A net expenditure of roughly forty-two thousand florins.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then raises a finger.\n\n\n\"However, Your Majesty should consider what we have saved, not merely what we have spent.\"\n\n\nHe pulls out a separate sheet.\n\n\n\nINDIRECT BENEFITS (Estimated Annual Savings)\n\n\n\"Before this expedition, Álvaro's reports indicated direct losses to Salé corsairs of approximately twelve thousand florins annually in captured cargo and ships. Indirect losses—trade diverted to safer routes, higher insurance costs, ransoms paid—added perhaps twenty to thirty thousand more.\"\n\nCategory\nEstimated Annual Savings\nDirect shipping losses prevented\n12,000\nIndirect trade losses prevented\n20,000-30,000\nRansoms no longer paid\n3,000-5,000\nTOTAL ANNUAL SAVINGS\n35,000-47,000\n\n\"If the corsair threat from Salé is eliminated for even two years, the expedition pays for itself. If it remains suppressed for five years or more...\" He shrugs. \"The raid becomes one of the most profitable military operations in recent Castilian history.\"\n\n\n\nDiego closes his ledger. \"There is one more consideration, Your Majesty. The captured documents—the records of Yusuf al-Rais detailing his network of collaborators across Morocco.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward slightly. \"These have no direct monetary value. But if Your Majesty wished to pressure certain Moroccan merchants, or provide intelligence to Commander Martín for future operations, or even sell the information to the Portuguese...\"\n\n\nHe leaves the thought unfinished.\n\n\n\"The total expenditure of forty-two thousand florins is significant but manageable within the current treasury. We ended 1435 with comfortable reserves, and the Constantinople settlement revenues are beginning to flow. The crown can absorb this cost without strain.\"\n\n\nHe waits for your questions."

They want to plan an outpost/fort at the newly discovered river mouth on the African coast, and correspond with Prince Henry the Navigator about this.\n\nLet me recall what the exploration results said:\n- Gil Eannes and Afonso Baldaya sailed far beyond Cape Bojador—some two hundred leagues or more\n- They discovered what may be the mouth of a great river\n- The coast there is less barren than the Saharan wastes above\n- They made contact with fishing peoples along the shore\n- Gold dust was traded—not in great quantities, but unmistakably gold\n- Baldaya identified a deep bay suitable for anchorage—a place where ships might shelter and take on water\n- Henry intends to establish a permanent presence there within the year\n\nSo the user wants to correspond with Henry about building a fort/outpost at this location. This is a diplomatic/planning conversation, not a persuasion attempt. Henry is already an enthusiastic ally and would welcome Castilian support for this venture.\n\nI should write Henry's response to Juan's inquiry. Henry would be excited about this—he's been scraping together money for 20 years and now has a wealthy, enthusiastic partner. But he would also have practical concerns about the logistics, costs, and how to maintain such a distant outpost.\n\nHistorically, the Portuguese did establish outposts along the African coast, but this was a gradual process. Arguim (Arguin) was established around 1445-1448 in our timeline. The river mouth discovered in this alternate timeline (with Juan's funding accelerating things) would be somewhere around the Senegal River area or perhaps earlier—maybe around Rio de Oro which was reached in 1435-1436 historically.\n\nLet me draft a letter from Henry responding to Juan's inquiry, discussing the practicalities of establishing an outpost at this river mouth location.\n\n\nSummer 1435, Toledo\n\n\nYou return to the moment after Prince Henry's letter arrived—the news of gold dust, of a river mouth, of two hundred leagues of African coast mapped in a single season. The Salé planning is set in motion, but your mind turns southward, to the opportunities Henry has uncovered.\n\n\nYou draft a letter to the Infante, inquiring about the possibility of establishing a permanent presence at the newly discovered river mouth.\n\n\n\nThree weeks later\n\n\nHenry's response arrives with a Portuguese merchant vessel putting in at Seville. The letter is lengthy—Henry writes as a man who has waited twenty years to have someone take his vision seriously.\n\n\n\nTo His Most Christian Majesty Juan II, King of Castile and León, Defensor Romaniae,\n\n\nBrother in Christ and beloved partner in this great enterprise,\n\n\nYour letter fills me with joy beyond expression. For two decades I have dreamed of permanent stations along the African coast—places where our ships might resupply, where we might trade directly with the peoples of the interior, where the Cross of Christ might stand as a beacon in heathen lands. That you share this vision, and ask how it might be achieved, tells me that God has truly blessed our partnership.\n\n\nYou ask whether an outpost at the river mouth is wise, and what would be needed. I shall answer plainly.\n\n\n\nON THE WISDOM OF THE VENTURE\n\n\nYes. A thousand times yes.\n\n\nThe river mouth Baldaya discovered is the first point south of Cape Bojador where ships may find reliable fresh water and shelter. The coast above is desert—the Sahara reaches to the very sea. But at this river, there is life. Fishing peoples. Signs of trade routes leading inland. And gold dust in the hands of men who gesture toward the rising sun.\n\n\nIf we establish ourselves there, we gain three things:\n\n\nFirst—a waystation for further exploration. Ships may resupply before pushing south. Crews may rest. Damaged vessels may be repaired. Without such stations, every voyage must carry provisions for the entire journey there and back. With them, we may reach twice as far.\n\n\nSecond—a trading post. The peoples Baldaya encountered were not hostile. They traded willingly. If we maintain a permanent presence, we may build relationships. Learn their languages. Discover what goods they value. And slowly, carefully, trace the gold to its source.\n\n\nThird—a statement of intent. The Moors control the overland routes to Mali and the gold kingdoms. They have grown rich as middlemen for centuries. A Christian outpost on the coast tells them—and tells the world—that we intend to break their monopoly. That we will reach the wealth of Africa without their permission.\n\n\n\nON WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED\n\n\nAn outpost in such a distant and isolated place is not a simple undertaking. I have thought long on this, and I believe the following would be required:\n\n\nMen:\nA garrison of perhaps 30-50 men to start. Soldiers, yes, but also craftsmen—carpenters, masons, a blacksmith. Men who can build and repair. Men who can endure isolation, heat, and the strangeness of a land unlike any in Christendom. Unmarried men, for now—there will be no families until the station is secure.\n\n\nShips:\nTwo vessels must remain permanently stationed at the outpost—one for coastal patrol and fishing, one larger vessel capable of the voyage home if emergency requires. Supply ships must visit at least twice yearly, more often if possible.\n\n\nFortification:\nA wooden palisade at first, with a stone tower if materials permit. The local peoples seem peaceful, but we cannot know what lies further inland. And other powers—the Moors, or rivals we have not yet encountered—may contest our presence.\n\n\nSupplies:\nThe outpost cannot be self-sufficient immediately. Grain, wine, oil, weapons, tools, cloth for trade—all must be shipped from Portugal or Castile until the station can grow its own food or trade for it reliably. I estimate two years before any degree of self-sufficiency.\n\n\nCost:\nI will not deceive you, brother. This is expensive. To establish the outpost—construction, initial garrison, supplies, dedicated vessels—I estimate 15,000 to 20,000 florins. To maintain it annually thereafter, perhaps 5,000 to 8,000 florins until trade revenues begin to flow.\n\n\nThese are rough figures. The true cost may be higher. The sea is unpredictable, and we are building in a land no Christian has held before.\n\n\n\nON THE DIVISION OF LABOR\n\n\nYou have been extraordinarily generous, Juan. Your gold has made this year's expeditions possible. But I must be honest about Portugal's limitations.\n\n\nMy brother Duarte supports my work, but Portugal is not a wealthy kingdom. The treasury is stretched by many demands. I have spent my own revenues—every maravedi I possess—on ships and sailors. I cannot fund a permanent outpost alone.\n\n\nIf Castile wishes to share in this venture, I welcome it with open arms. Perhaps we might divide the burden:\n\n\nPortugal provides the ships, the sailors, the navigators—we have the expertise, the charts, the men who know these waters.\n\n\nCastile provides the bulk of the funding and a portion of the garrison—your treasury is deeper, and your soldiers proved their worth at Granada.\n\n\nThe outpost flies both banners. The trade profits are shared equally. The glory belongs to Christendom.\n\n\nOr if Your Majesty prefers a different arrangement, I am willing to hear it. What matters is that the work is done—not who receives the credit.\n\n\n\nON TIMING\n\n\nIf we are to establish an outpost, we should do so soon. The sailing season is upon us. I intend to send Baldaya south again this summer with orders to survey the river mouth more thoroughly—to find the best site for a fort, to learn what he can of the local peoples, to assess the dangers.\n\n\nIf his report is favorable, we could begin construction as early as spring 1436. The first permanent garrison might be in place by summer of that year.\n\n\nBut this depends on Your Majesty's decision. If you wish to proceed, I need to know soon, so that I may adjust my plans accordingly.\n\n\n\nI await your reply with eager anticipation. Together, we stand at the threshold of something unprecedented—a Christian presence on the African coast, beyond the reach of any Moorish sultan, pointing the way to riches and souls beyond counting.\n\n\nYour brother in Christ and enterprise,\n\n\nHenrique, Infante of Portugal\n\n\nWritten at Sagres, the Feast of Saint John, Anno Domini 1435\n\n\n\nThe letter sits before you. Henry's enthusiasm is evident, as is his practical understanding of the challenges. Fifteen to twenty thousand florins to establish the outpost, five to eight thousand annually to maintain it—significant sums, but not impossible given Castile's current finances.\n\n\nThe question is whether to commit, and on what terms."

If costs exceed this amount, inform me and more will follow.\n\n\nBeyond this, I grant a further 10,000 florins for continued exploration. Do not let the work of building distract from the work of discovery. While the outpost rises, let your caravels push ever southward. Find the source of the gold. Map the coast. Learn what lies beyond.\n\n\nAs to the division of labor you propose—Portugal provides ships, sailors, and expertise; Castile provides funding and soldiers—I accept this gladly.

Let the outpost fly both banners, as you suggest.\n\n\nBut let us also remember what your brother and I agreed in Toledo: all overseas territories taken under this partnership fall under the protection of the Defensor Romaniae. This is not Castilian dominion over Portuguese achievement—God forbid. It is a framework for unity. One fleet serving two crowns, as Duarte so eloquently said. One enterprise, one purpose, one Christendom reaching into the unknown.\n\n\nThe outpost shall be governed jointly. Its commander shall answer to both crowns. Its profits shall be shared equally. And should any power—Moorish, heathen, or Christian rival—threaten what we build together, the full strength of our combined arms shall answer.\n\n\nSend Baldaya south. Survey the river mouth. Find the best site for our fort. And when his report returns, begin construction with all haste. I want Christian boots on African soil before the year is out, and a permanent station flying our banners by summer 1436.\n\n\nTwenty years you have labored for this vision, Henrique. Twenty years of scraping and saving, of sending brave men into the unknown with inadequate support, of watching expeditions fail for want of resources. Those days are ended.

The outpost attempt must be abandoned for this year. Henry is devastated. Significant financial loss with nothing to show for it. The project can be attempted again, but momentum is lost and men will be harder to recruit.\n4-8\nSerious Setback: The outpost is established, but disease sweeps through the garrison in the first months. A third or more of the men die. Survivors are demoralized. The commander sends desperate pleas for reinforcement and relief. The outpost survives but barely—clinging to existence rather than thriving. Continued exploration is impossible while the station struggles to survive.\n9-15\nMajor Difficulties: Construction proceeds, but problems mount. Perhaps the initial site proves unsuitable and must be relocated. Perhaps local peoples, initially friendly, become hostile after misunderstandings. Perhaps supply ships are delayed and the garrison faces hunger. The outpost is established by summer 1436, but weakly—undermanned, undersupplied, its future uncertain. Exploration continues but yields modest results.\n16-25\nTroubled Success: The outpost rises, but not without cost. Significant challenges—disease, supply problems, construction difficulties, or friction with local populations—are overcome through determination and sacrifice. The garrison is established but has lost men and morale is fragile. The station is functional but vulnerable. Exploration yields some new discoveries but nothing dramatic.\n26-40\nAdequate Progress: The outpost is established largely as planned, with typical difficulties of any pioneering venture. Some men lost to disease or accident. Some construction delays. Some tension with local peoples, resolved through gifts and patience. By summer 1436, a wooden palisade and basic structures stand at the river mouth. A garrison of 30-40 men holds the position. Exploration pushes perhaps 50 leagues further south, with incremental discoveries.\n41-60\nSolid Success: Baldaya's survey identifies an excellent site. Construction proceeds on schedule. The garrison, well-supplied thanks to Castilian funding, maintains good health and morale. Relations with local peoples develop positively—regular trade is established. By summer 1436, the outpost is functional and secure: wooden walls, a stone watchtower begun, storehouses, a small chapel. Exploration continues, pushing 75-100 leagues further south with promising discoveries.\n61-75\nGood Success: Everything proceeds better than expected. The site is ideal—defensible, with good water and anchorage. Construction is completed ahead of schedule. The garrison thrives. Local peoples prove eager trading partners, bringing goods from the interior. The first trickle of gold dust—modest but real—flows through the outpost. Exploration reaches significant new territory, perhaps discovering another river or promising anchorage further south. Henry writes with enthusiastic reports.\n76-85\nExcellent Success: The outpost becomes a genuine foothold, not merely a survival outpost. Stone fortifications progress rapidly thanks to the abundant funding. The garrison is healthy and confident. Trade relationships with local peoples yield valuable intelligence about the interior—trade routes, kingdoms, the sources of gold. Exploration makes substantial progress, perhaps reaching 150 leagues beyond the previous limit. The outpost begins to seem less like an isolated venture and more like the first link in a chain.\n86-93\nOutstanding Success: The outpost exceeds all expectations. By summer 1436, it is a proper fortified trading post—stone walls, permanent structures, a growing relationship with local peoples who begin to see advantages in Christian partnership. Gold dust flows in increasing quantities. Exploration pushes dramatically southward, discovering major geographical features—a great river, a fertile coast, evidence of wealthy kingdoms in the interior. The African enterprise begins to look not merely viable but genuinely profitable.\n94-97\nExceptional Achievement: Beyond establishing the outpost, the expedition makes a discovery of major significance. Perhaps direct contact with traders from the interior who speak of the great kingdoms of Mali and their wealth. Perhaps a second viable outpost site further south. Perhaps navigational discoveries that will accelerate future exploration. The outpost is secure, trade is flourishing, and Henry writes that the work of twenty years is being accomplished in two.\n98-100\nHistoric Breakthrough: The outpost establishment coincides with a transformative discovery. Perhaps the explorers reach the Senegal River or make contact with the Wolof kingdom. Perhaps they obtain clear intelligence about overland routes to Timbuktu and the gold markets. Perhaps they discover that the African coast turns eastward—suggesting that circumnavigation might be possible. Whatever the specifics, the strategic implications are immense. The outpost becomes not merely a trading post but the gateway to a new world of commerce and possibility. Henry declares it the greatest achievement of his life.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

This is an excellent result - the outpost exceeds all expectations, with stone walls, permanent structures, flourishing trade relationships with local peoples, increasing gold dust flow, and dramatic exploration progress southward discovering major geographical features.\n\nLet me craft a narrative that reflects this outstanding success while keeping it grounded in historical realism. The timeline would be:\n- Summer 1435: Baldaya's survey\n- Autumn 1435 - Spring 1436: Construction begins\n- Summer 1436: Outpost fully operational\n\nI should describe:\n1. Baldaya's successful survey finding an ideal site\n2. Construction proceeding excellently\n3. Strong garrison establishment\n4. Positive relations with local peoples\n5. Gold dust flowing in increasing quantities\n6. Major exploration progress - perhaps 150+ leagues south\n7. Discovery of significant geographical features\n\nI need to be careful not to jump too far ahead historically - by 1436-1437 in real history, the Portuguese were still relatively early in their exploration. But with the massive funding boost from Juan, they could plausibly be ahead of schedule.\n\nLet me write a compelling narrative that captures this outstanding success.\n\n\nSummer 1435 - Summer 1436\n\n\nThe machinery of empire begins to turn.\n\n\n\nBaldaya's Survey (Summer 1435)\n\n\nAfonso Gonçalves Baldaya departs Sagres in July with three caravels and explicit instructions: find the perfect site for a permanent Christian station on the African coast.\n\n\nHe returns in October, his charts covered in annotations, his report running to thirty pages.\n\n\nThe river mouth—which Henry has begun calling the Rio do Ouro, the River of Gold, after the dust traded there—proves even more promising than initial reports suggested. Baldaya has found an elevated position on the northern bank, perhaps a mile inland from the sea. The ground is solid, defensible on three sides by the river's curve. Fresh water is reliable. The anchorage, while not deep enough for the largest carracks, can shelter caravels and smaller vessels safely.\n\n\nMost importantly, Baldaya reports that the local peoples—fishing folk who live in scattered camps along the coast—showed no hostility during his extended survey. They watched from a distance, occasionally approached to trade fish for cloth and iron tools, and seemed more curious than threatened.\n\n\n\"They have no fortifications,\" Baldaya writes. \"No weapons beyond fishing spears. They fear the desert peoples of the interior more than they fear us. I believe they may welcome a strong presence that offers them protection and trade.\"\n\n\nHenry reads the report and immediately begins organizing the construction expedition.\n\n\n\nThe Construction Fleet (Spring 1436)\n\n\nThe fleet that departs Lagos in March 1436 is unlike anything Henry has previously assembled. Castilian gold has made possible what Portuguese means alone never could.\n\n\nSeven vessels carry:\n\n\nForty-seven soldiers (thirty Castilian, seventeen Portuguese)\n\nTwenty-three craftsmen (carpenters, masons, a blacksmith, coopers)\n\nTwelve sailors who will remain as permanent crew for the station's boats\n\nThree Franciscan friars (one who speaks Arabic, two who are learning)\n\nPrefabricated timber for the initial palisade\n\nTools, weapons, provisions for eight months\n\nTrade goods: cloth, iron implements, glass beads, copper wire\n\nBuilding materials: lime for mortar, iron fittings, nails by the barrel\n\nTwo disassembled fishing boats and one coastal patrol vessel\n\n\nThe expedition commander is Captain Gonçalo de Sintra, a veteran of Henry's service—steady, experienced, fluent in the ways of African coastal navigation.\n\n\n\nConstruction (Spring-Summer 1436)\n\n\nThe first reports return to Sagres in June, carried by a supply vessel making the return voyage.\n\n\n\"By the grace of God, the work proceeds beyond all expectation.\"\n\n\nCaptain de Sintra writes that the site is everything Baldaya promised. The wooden palisade rose within three weeks. By the time the supply ship departed, the stone watchtower's foundation was already laid, using rock quarried from an outcropping two miles upriver.\n\n\nThe local peoples—de Sintra calls them the Imraguen, a name the Arabic-speaking friar learned from coastal traders—have proven not merely peaceful but actively helpful. They showed the garrison where to find the best water, which plants were edible, where fish ran thickest. In exchange, they received iron fishhooks and knives that transformed their daily work.\n\n\n\"They look upon our walls with wonder, not fear,\" de Sintra reports. \"I believe they see us as protection against the desert raiders who sometimes sweep down upon their camps. For the first time in their memory, they have powerful friends.\"\n\n\n\nThe Summer Reports (August 1436)\n\n\nThe second supply run returns in August with news that makes Henry weep with joy.\n\n\nThe outpost—now formally christened São João da Ribeira, Saint John of the Riverbank—stands complete in its first phase. A wooden palisade encloses nearly an acre of ground. Within it: barracks for the garrison, storehouses, a workshop, a small chapel where the friars say Mass each morning. The stone watchtower rises thirty feet, visible from miles out to sea—a beacon for approaching ships.\n\n\nThe garrison is healthy. Only three men have died—two to fever in the first weeks, one to a construction accident. The rest have adapted to the climate, learned to work in the early morning and late evening, resting through the brutal midday heat.\n\n\nBut it is the trade report that sets Henry's hands trembling.\n\n\n\"Gold dust flows now in quantities that would have seemed fantasy a year ago.\"\n\n\nThe Imraguen, it transpires, are not the source of the gold. They are intermediaries. Traders come from the interior—men of darker skin who speak languages the friars cannot yet comprehend—bringing gold dust, ivory, and strange peppers in exchange for salt, cloth, and metal goods.\n\n\nDe Sintra has established a weekly market. The quantities are still modest by European standards—perhaps 200 florins worth of gold dust accumulated over four months—but the trend is unmistakable. As word spreads that Christians at the river mouth offer fair trade and do not raid for slaves, more traders come.\n\n\n\"They speak of great kingdoms far to the south and east,\" de Sintra writes. \"Kingdoms where gold is so plentiful that the kings weigh themselves in it on festival days. I do not know if this is truth or legend. But the gold dust in our strongbox is real enough.\"\n\n\n\nThe Exploration Report\n\n\nWhile the outpost rose, Henry did not neglect the work of discovery. Three caravels under Captain Dinis Dias pushed south from São João da Ribeira in May, using the new station as their base of supply.\n\n\nThey returned in late July having mapped nearly one hundred and seventy leagues of previously unknown coastline.\n\n\nThe desert, Dias reports, is finally ending. The coast curves gradually eastward. The land grows greener. Rivers—real rivers, not seasonal streams—cut through to the sea. One river in particular drew his attention: wide, deep, flowing strong even in the dry season.\n\n\n\"The local peoples call it the Senegal,\" Dias writes. \"Or something like that word. They say it leads far into the interior, to kingdoms of great wealth. They speak of a city called Timbuktu, where scholars gather and merchants trade gold for salt pound for pound.\"\n\n\nDias did not ascend the river—his orders were to map the coast, not explore inland—but he marked its position carefully. It lies perhaps one hundred and fifty leagues south of São João da Ribeira.\n\n\n\"If we establish a second station at this river's mouth,\" Dias concludes, \"we will have a direct route to the interior kingdoms. The overland trade that has enriched the Moors for centuries could flow to us instead.\"\n\n\n\nHenry's Letter (September 1436)\n\n\nHenry's letter to you arrives in Toledo as the leaves begin to turn.\n\n\n\nTo His Most Christian Majesty Juan II,\n\n\nBrother, what can I say that the enclosed reports do not say better?\n\n\nTwenty years I have labored for this. Twenty years of failure, of shipwreck, of men lost and dreams deferred. And now, in a single year, with your gold and God's grace, we have accomplished what I feared might take my entire lifetime.\n\n\nSão João da Ribeira stands. The first permanent Christian station south of Cape Bojador. Stone and timber on African soil, flying the banners of Portugal and Castile. A chapel where Mass is said within sight of heathen lands. A market where gold dust changes hands without a single Moorish middleman taking his cut.\n\n\nAnd Dias has found the Senegal. The river that leads to Timbuktu. To Mali. To the source of the gold.\n\n\nI tell you plainly, Juan: we stand at the threshold of something unprecedented. Not merely trade, not merely exploration, but the reshaping of the world's commerce. The wealth that has flowed north through the Sahara for centuries—the wealth that built the great mosques of Fez and Marrakesh—that wealth can flow to us instead. Through our hands. Through our ships. Through our stations on the coast.\n\n\nI am already planning the next phase. A second outpost at the Senegal's mouth. More ships. More men. The capacity to establish not merely stations but a permanent presence along the entire coast.\n\n\nThis will require more resources than even your extraordinary generosity has provided. But the returns—Juan, the returns will be beyond calculation. Within five years, the gold trade alone could yield tens of thousands of florins annually. Within ten, we may find the route to the Indies themselves.\n\n\nI do not know how to thank you adequately. You believed in me when no one else would fund my dreams. You gave me the means to prove that I was not a madman chasing phantoms.\n\n\nHistory will remember what we have begun together.\n\n\nYour eternal brother in Christ,\n\n\nHenrique\n\n\n\nSummary of Results (1435-1436):\n\n\nSão João da Ribeira Outpost:\n\n\nLocation: Rio do Ouro (River of Gold), ~200 leagues south of Cape Bojador\n\nFortifications: Wooden palisade, 30-foot stone watchtower, permanent structures\n\nGarrison: ~70 men (soldiers, craftsmen, sailors, friars), healthy and well-supplied\n\nRelations with locals: Excellent—Imraguen people actively cooperative\n\nTrade: Weekly market established; ~200 florins gold dust accumulated in first four months; ivory and peppers also flowing\n\nStatus: Secure and thriving\n\n\nExploration Progress:\n\n\n~170 leagues of new coastline mapped south of the outpost\n\nSenegal River discovered (~150 leagues south of São João)\n\nEvidence of wealthy interior kingdoms (Mali, Timbuktu) confirmed through local traders\n\nCoast beginning to turn eastward; desert giving way to greener lands\n\n\nStrategic Position:\n\n\nFirst permanent Christian foothold on sub-Saharan African coast\n\nDirect trade with interior bypassing Moorish middlemen established\n\nFoundation laid for second outpost at Senegal River mouth\n\nPortuguese-Castilian maritime partnership proving extraordinarily productive"

      "say": "Thought process: Triangulated outpost location using historical geography and league measurements.\n\nThe user is asking a meta question about the geographical location of the outpost in modern terms. Let me work through this.\n\nCape Bojador is located at approximately 26°N latitude on the coast of Western Sahara.\n\nThe outpost is described as being about 200 leagues south of Cape Bojador, at the \"Rio do Ouro\" (River of Gold).\n\nA league in maritime terms was typically about 3 nautical miles, or roughly 5.5 km. So 200 leagues would be approximately 600 nautical miles or about 1,100 km south of Cape Bojador.\n\nHistorically, the \"Rio de Oro\" (River of Gold) was the name given by the Portuguese to a region of the coast - it's actually not a real river but an inlet or bay. The historical Rio de Oro is located in what is now Western Sahara, around 23-24°N latitude. The region was named this because of the gold trade, though the \"river\" was actually just an inlet (modern-day Dakhla Bay area or Villa Cisneros area).\n\nHowever, the roll result (87 - Outstanding Success) described the outpost as being quite successful with gold trade and the Senegal River being discovered about 150 leagues further south.\n\nThe Senegal River is a real river that forms the border between Senegal and Mauritania, emptying into the Atlantic at around 16°N latitude, near the city of Saint-Louis, Senegal.\n\nSo if the Senegal River is 150 leagues south of the outpost, and a league is about 3 nautical miles (roughly 5.5 km), then 150 leagues = about 450 nautical miles or roughly 825 km.\n\nWorking backwards from the Senegal River (at roughly 16°N):\n- 150 leagues north would put the outpost somewhere around 23-24°N latitude\n- This would place it in the area of modern-day Western Sahara, possibly near the historical \"Rio de Oro\" bay area near Dakhla\n\n\n- Villa Cisneros (modern Dakhla) sits at approximately 23.7°N, aligning with the calculated location\n\nI'm considering another potential site: Arguin, positioned around 20°N latitude. The Portuguese established a significant fort there in the 1440s, and the Arguin Bank was historically crucial. However, the specific description of a river mouth with fresh water suggests the Dakhla area might be more probable.\n\nThe geographical details reveal some intriguing spatial challenges. Cape Bojador's position at 26°N and the mention of being 200 leagues south creates a complex navigational puzzle. The coordinates seem to conflict with the Senegal River's location, indicating potential discrepancies in historical maritime records.\n\nI'm exploring alternative league measurements to reconcile these geographical references. Using a 5 km league calculation, the potential locations shift dramatically - placing the potential outpost near the Mauritania/Senegal border around 17°N. However, the subsequent 150 leagues further south would extend into Guinea, which doesn't align with known historical maritime exploration routes.\n\nThe inconsistencies suggest I need to carefully re-examine the original Portuguese navigational measurements and cross-reference them with contemporary geographical understanding.\n\nHistorical maritime progression reveals a much more gradual exploration timeline. The Portuguese actually reached the Senegal River in 1444-1445, but our campaign's exceptional success roll has dramatically accelerated this achievement, potentially reaching the region by 1436 - a significant advancement over historical records.\n\nThe \"Rio de Oro\" designation was historically imprecise, applied to a broader regional area rather than a specific river location, which further complicates precise geographical mapping.\n\nPotential outpost sites cluster around 20-22°N latitude in modern-day Mauritania, with promising locations including the Bay of Arguin, near Nouadhibou, or within the Banc d'Arguin National Park. These areas offer seasonal streams, potential fresh water sources, and strategic maritime positioning approximately 600-750 km north of the Senegal River.\n\n\nGood question—let me work through the geography.\n\n\nHistorical Reference Points:\n\n\nCape Bojador is located at approximately 26°N latitude, in modern Western Sahara\n\nThe Senegal River mouth is at approximately 16°N latitude, at the border of modern Senegal and Mauritania (near the city of Saint-Louis)\n\n\nThe Outpost Location:\n\n\nThe outpost is described as being at the \"Rio do Ouro\" (River of Gold), approximately 200 leagues south of Cape Bojador, and approximately 150 leagues north of the Senegal River.\n\n\nUsing a Portuguese maritime league of roughly 5-6 km:\n\n\n150 leagues north of the Senegal (16°N) = approximately 750-900 km north\n\nThis places the outpost around 20-22°N latitude\n\n\nThis would locate São João da Ribeira somewhere along the coast of modern-day Mauritania, most likely in the area of:\n\n\nThe Bay of Arguin / Banc d'Arguin (around 20°N), or\n\nNear Nouadhibou (formerly Port-Étienne), or\n\nThe Cape Blanc peninsula area\n\n\nHistorically, the Portuguese established Arguim Fort in this general area in the 1440s-1450s—it became their first major African trading post. Your outpost has essentially accelerated this historical development by about a decade, thanks to the exceptional funding and the outstanding success roll.\n\n\nThe \"Rio do Ouro\" was historically more of a bay/inlet than a true river, but in our narrative we've placed it at a seasonal river mouth that provides fresh water—a slight liberty for gameplay purposes."

Queen Lucia moves through the final weeks of her pregnancy with the quiet determination that has characterized her time as Juan's wife.

Lucia recovers physically but is devastated. A period of mourning follows.\n6-10\nSerious Complications: A dangerous delivery—prolonged labor, breech presentation, or significant bleeding. Lucia survives, the child survives, but recovery is slow and painful. The physicians advise against future pregnancies, at least for several years. Both mother and child require extended care.\n11-18\nDifficult Delivery: Labor is long and exhausting—perhaps a full day or more. The midwives are tested. Lucia suffers considerably but endures. The child is born healthy. Recovery takes several weeks longer than expected, and Lucia is weakened for months afterward. No permanent damage, but a reminder that childbirth is never routine.\n19-30\nChallenging but Successful: Some complications arise—perhaps the cord is wrapped, perhaps the child is large, perhaps labor stalls and must be encouraged. The midwives earn their pay. But in the end, both mother and child come through safely. Lucia recovers normally, if tiredly.\n31-55\nNormal Delivery: Labor progresses as expected. Some hours of pain and effort, then a healthy cry. The child is born without significant complications. Lucia recovers well, resuming light duties within two weeks, full duties within a month. A routine royal birth—which is to say, a miracle witnessed so often it seems ordinary.\n56-75\nEasy Delivery: Lucia's body remembers the work from Bianca's birth.

Lucia, barely exhausted, jokes with her ladies within hours of delivery. The physicians marvel at her resilience. Recovery is rapid and complete.\n89-95\nExcellent Delivery—Strong Child: Everything goes perfectly. A quick labor, an easy delivery, a notably healthy and robust infant. The child is large, strong-lunged, and vigorous from the first moment. Lucia recovers so quickly that the midwives caution her to rest more than she wishes to. An auspicious beginning.\n96-99\nExceptional—Twins: The midwives' suspicions are confirmed. Lucia carries not one child but two. The delivery is more demanding, but both infants are born healthy—a rare and celebrated outcome. Two new members of the House of Trastámara in a single day. Lucia requires extended recovery but suffers no lasting harm.\n100\nBlessed Event: Twins, both healthy and strong, delivered with remarkable ease. Lucia recovers swiftly. The court celebrates. Poets compose verses. The Church declares it a sign of divine favor upon the union of Castile and Este.

The son Fernando remains the heir as Prince of Asturias.\n\nI should narrate this birth and let the player decide on a name, or see if Lucia suggests one.\n\n\nA Daughter\n\n\nThe child is a girl—small, perfectly formed, with a tuft of dark hair and her mother's delicate features. She breathes easily, sleeps peacefully, and when she wakes, her cry is strong and clear.\n\n\nLucia gazes down at her second daughter with quiet contentment. \"Another girl,\" she murmurs. \"The House of Trastámara will not lack for marriage alliances.\"\n\n\nShe looks up at you, a hint of her sharp wit returning despite her exhaustion. \"Four children now, Juan. Three daughters and a son. Fernando remains your only heir—we shall have to try again, I think, once I have recovered.\"\n\n\nThere is no disappointment in her voice. A healthy child is a blessing, regardless of sex. And daughters of kings are valuable in their own right—coins to be spent in the great game of dynastic alliance, bridges between kingdoms, peacemakers and power-brokers.\n\n\n\nThe court celebrates with appropriate joy. Church bells ring across Toledo. Prayers of thanksgiving are offered in the cathedral. The news spreads across Castile within days: the Queen has delivered safely, mother and child are well, the royal nursery grows ever fuller.\n\n\nIn the nursery, Princess Catalina—now three and a half years old—peers at her newest sister with the skeptical curiosity of a child confronted with yet another rival for attention. She has already accepted Bianca, now one year old and beginning to toddle. A third sister is simply more of the same.\n\n\n\"She's very small,\" Catalina observes.\n\n\n\"You were small once too,\" Doña Beatriz reminds her.\n\n\n\"I don't remember that,\" Catalina says with the absolute certainty of childhood, and returns to her wooden horses.\n\n\n\nThe Naming\n\n\nLucia looks to you, the baby drowsing at her breast.\n\n\n\"Have you thought of a name, my lord? Bianca I named for Italy, for the simplicity of a child born far from home. But this one...\" She strokes the infant's cheek. \"This one was born in Toledo. In your kingdom. Perhaps she should bear a Castilian name. Or perhaps you wish to honor someone—a saint, a relative, a memory.\"\n\n\nShe pauses, her grey-green eyes meeting yours.\n\n\n\"What shall we call her?\"\n\n\n\nCurrent Royal Children:\n\nName\nBorn\nAge\nMother\nStatus\nPrincess Catalina\nJanuary 28, 1432\n3 years\nIsabel of Portugal (†)\nHealthy\nPrince Fernando\nAugust 3, 1433\n2 years\nIsabel of Portugal (†)\nHeir (Prince of Asturias)\nPrincess Bianca\nSeptember 14, 1434\n1 year\nLucia d'Este\nHealthy\nNew daughter\nSeptember 19, 1435\nNewborn\nLucia d'Este\nHealthy"

I should respond as Lucia, giving her perspective on this name choice.\n\nLet me think about whether \"Esmeralda\" is historically appropriate for 15th century Castilian nobility:\n\n1. Esmeralda means \"emerald\" in Spanish\n2. It's derived from the Greek \"smaragdos\" \n3. While gemstone names existed in medieval times, \"Esmeralda\" as a given name was quite rare in 15th century Spain\n4. Most noble children in this era were named after saints, relatives, or traditional royal names\n5. Common Castilian royal names for women included: Isabel, María, Juana, Leonor, Catalina, Blanca, Constanza, Beatriz\n\nLucia, being Italian and practical, might note that:\n- It's an unusual choice for a princess\n- It doesn't honor a saint or relative directly\n- But it's beautiful and distinctive\n- Perhaps she might gently suggest alternatives or ask about Juan's reasoning\n\nI should have Lucia respond in character - she's direct, sharp-tongued, but also loving and supportive of Juan. She might express gentle surprise at such an unconventional choice while being open to it.\n\n\nLucia tilts her head, considering. Her expression is thoughtful rather than dismissive—she has learned that Juan often has reasons for his choices, even when they seem unconventional.\n\n\n\"Esmeralda,\" she repeats, letting the syllables roll off her tongue. \"The emerald. It is... unusual, my lord. Beautiful, certainly. But unusual.\"\n\n\nShe shifts the sleeping infant gently, her eyes meeting yours.\n\n\n\"In Ferrara, in Castile, in all the courts I know, princesses are named for saints, for queens, for grandmothers whose memory must be honored. María, Juana, Leonor, Constanza...\" She pauses. \"I named Bianca simply because I wanted something clean and bright for a child born so far from home. But even that raised eyebrows among the more traditional ladies.\"\n\n\nA small smile plays at her lips. \"Esmeralda would raise more than eyebrows. The Archbishop will ask which Saint Esmeralda we honor. The genealogists will search in vain for an ancestress by that name. The gossips will wonder if you have taken leave of your senses.\"\n\n\nShe looks down at the baby, stroking the dark hair with one finger.\n\n\n\"And yet... she is our daughter. Not a treaty. Not a coin to be spent. Ours.\" She glances back up at you. \"If you wish to give her a name that is hers alone—a jewel, bright and precious—I will not argue against it.\"\n\n\nHer tone turns practical. \"Though perhaps we might add a saint's name as well? Esmeralda María, perhaps? It would satisfy the priests and give her a name-day to celebrate.\"\n\n\nShe waits for your decision, the infant sleeping peacefully between you."

Lucia should respond warmly to this choice, and we should have a small moment to mark the naming before moving on.\n\nTeresa is a good, pious Castilian name. Saint Teresa of Ávila is actually from a later period (1515-1582), so I made a small historical error there. However, there were other Saint Teresas venerated in the 15th century - particularly Saint Teresa of Portugal (1178-1250), also known as Teresa of León, who was a Portuguese princess who became a Cistercian nun. That's much more appropriate for the 1430s.\n\nLet me have Lucia respond warmly and we can wrap up this scene with the naming ceremony.\n\n\nLucia nods, her expression warm with approval.\n\n\n\"Teresa,\" she repeats softly, looking down at the infant. \"A strong name. A saint's name.\"\n\n\nShe traces a gentle finger across the baby's brow. \"Saint Teresa of Portugal was a princess who became a nun—a woman who chose God over worldly power. And yet she was born to royalty, understood its burdens, its temptations.\" Lucia glances up at you. \"A good patron for a king's daughter. One who will remind her that faith matters more than crowns.\"\n\n\nThe baby stirs, makes a small sound, then settles again.\n\n\n\"Teresa of Trastámara,\" Lucia says, testing the full weight of it. \"Princess Teresa. Yes. It suits her.\"\n\n\n\nThe Baptism\n\n\nThree days later, the infant is baptized in the Cathedral of Toledo. Archbishop Cerezuela performs the rite himself, pouring holy water over the child's head as she wails her protest at the cold.\n\n\n\"I baptize thee Teresa María, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\"\n\n\nThe María is added quietly, as Lucia suggested—a sop to convention, a saint's name tucked behind the primary one. But she will be known as Teresa.\n\n\nThe godparents are chosen carefully: Don Álvaro de Luna, ever-present at your side, and the Countess of Alba, a pious woman of impeccable reputation. The choices signal continuity and stability—no foreign entanglements, no grand political statements. Simply a Castilian princess, baptized in Castile, held by Castilians.\n\n\n\nCurrent Royal Children (Updated):\n\nName\nBorn\nAge\nMother\nStatus\nPrincess Catalina\nJanuary 28, 1432\n3 years\nIsabel of Portugal (†)\nHealthy\nPrince Fernando\nAugust 3, 1433\n2 years\nIsabel of Portugal (†)\nHeir (Prince of Asturias)\nPrincess Bianca\nSeptember 14, 1434\n1 year\nLucia d'Este\nHealthy\nPrincess Teresa\nSeptember 19, 1435\nNewborn\nLucia d'Este\nHealthy\n\n\nThe nursery grows crowded.

Within a fortnight she is back at council meetings, her sharp mind undiminished by the trials of childbirth. She catches your eye across the chamber one evening and smiles—tired, yes, but content.\n\n\n\"Four children,\" she murmurs later, in the privacy of your chambers. \"And I am only twenty-five.

This is a thoughtful parenting question that reflects Juan's character - he's been shown to care deeply about his children.\n\nLet me recall what we know about Catalina:\n- Born January 28, 1432 - so she's nearly 4 years old by late 1435\n- Mother was Queen Isabel of Portugal, who died in childbirth with Fernando\n- Has an extraordinary singing voice (noted in Chapter 2.32)\n- Described as having genuine intelligence, sunny disposition, imperious manner\n- Remarkable resilience after mother's death\n- Natural horsemanship instincts\n- Easy bond-forming with new people\n- Calls Lucia \"Lucia-mama\"\n- \"Fearless\" \n- Accepted wooden block from Henry as if it were a holy relic\n\nThe user wants Lucia's opinion on:\n1. How Catalina is developing\n2. Having her around other children (not just siblings)\n3. Allowing her more independence and freedom to play without constant supervision\n\nThis is a conversation between Juan and Lucia. I should have Lucia respond thoughtfully, perhaps bringing in the medieval context where noble children were often quite strictly supervised, but also acknowledging Juan's more progressive instincts. Lucia is described as sharp-tongued, politically astute, and will argue with Juan when she thinks he's wrong - but she's also adaptable and loving toward the children.\n\nI should also consider the medieval context:\n- Noble children, especially princesses, were typically closely chaperoned\n- There were real dangers (kidnapping, illness from contact with commoners)\n- But children did play - with other noble children, with servants' children sometimes\n- Education for noble girls focused on household management, religion, sometimes music and reading\n- Catalina's extraordinary voice was noted - perhaps she should have music instruction\n\nLet me write a response where Lucia gives her assessment of Catalina and they discuss options for her upbringing.\n\n\nLucia sets aside her embroidery—a task she performs more for appearance than enjoyment—and considers your question with the seriousness it deserves.\n\n\n\"Catalina,\" she says slowly, \"is... remarkable. And I do not say that merely because she is your daughter and I am her Lucia-mama.\"\n\n\nShe rises and moves to the window, looking out over the courtyard where, even now, you can hear the distant sound of children's voices from the nursery wing.\n\n\n\"She is not yet four years old, and already she commands a room. Not through tantrums or demands—though she has her imperious moments—but through... presence. She watches. She listens. She remembers everything.\" Lucia shakes her head with something like wonder. \"Last week she corrected one of her nurses on the proper form of address for a Portuguese ambassador. The nurse had made the same error three months ago. Catalina remembered.\"\n\n\nShe turns back to face you.\n\n\n\"Her voice, of course, you know about. King Duarte was not exaggerating—it is extraordinary. I have arranged for one of the cathedral choirmasters to visit twice weekly. He says she has perfect pitch, whatever that means. He looked rather pale when he said it.\"\n\n\n\nLucia's expression grows more thoughtful.\n\n\n\"But you ask about her childhood. About play. About freedom.\" She returns to her seat, folding her hands. \"You are right to think on this, Juan. I have watched her, and I see... concerns.\"\n\n\n\"She is surrounded by adults who defer to her. Nurses, servants, tutors—they treat her as a princess first and a child second. When she plays, someone is always watching, always ready to intervene, always steering her toward 'appropriate' activities.\" Lucia's lip curls slightly. \"Embroidery. Prayers. Sitting still and looking decorative.\"\n\n\n\"The other children in the nursery are her siblings—a two-year-old brother and two infant sisters. She cannot truly play with them. She mothers them, which is sweet, but it is not the same as having companions her own age. Playmates who might argue with her, challenge her, refuse to let her win simply because she is the princess.\"\n\n\nShe meets your eyes directly.\n\n\n\"In Ferrara, I grew up with cousins, with the children of court officials, with a small horde of noble brats who pulled my hair and stole my toys and made me fight for my place among them. I hated it sometimes. But it taught me... things. How to read people. How to hold my ground. How to lose gracefully and win without gloating.\"\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\"Catalina has none of that. She is adored, protected, isolated. And I fear that if we do not change something, she will grow into a woman who has never been told 'no' by anyone who mattered to her.\"\n\n\n\nLucia leans forward, her tone shifting to the practical.\n\n\n\"If you wish to give her companions, there are options. The daughters of high nobility—girls near her age from families like the Mendozas, the Guzmáns, the Pimentels. They could be brought to court as meninas—companions to the princess. It is traditional enough that no one would question it.\"\n\n\n\"But,\" she raises a finger, \"if you want her to have freedom—to play without constant supervision, to skin her knees and climb trees and be a child—that is harder. Every noble family will want their daughter to report back on what the princess said and did. Every nurse will be terrified of letting the king's heir fall off a horse or catch a chill.\"\n\n\nShe considers.\n\n\n\"Perhaps... a middle path? A small household of her own, within the palace but with some separation. Companions chosen not only for their family connections but for their temperaments—girls who will be true playmates, not sycophants. A governess who understands that children need to run and shout and make mistakes. Supervised, yes, but not smothered.\"\n\n\nHer eyes soften.\n\n\n\"She lost her mother at eighteen months, Juan. She adapted—she is resilient, as you know—but I see it sometimes. A wariness beneath the sunshine. A need to control, to know what comes next. Perhaps some freedom, some ordinary childhood chaos, would help her trust that the world will not always snatch away what she loves.\"\n\n\n\nLucia waits, then adds quietly:\n\n\n\"What did you have in mind? When you speak of less chaperonage, of other children—what does that look like to you?\""

This is very unusual for 15th century nobility.\n\nLucia would likely have mixed reactions to this:\n1. She might appreciate the sentiment and the wisdom behind it\n2. But she would also have practical and social concerns about propriety, security, and what the court would think\n3. She is politically astute and would understand the implications\n\nI should have her respond thoughtfully, acknowledging the appeal of Juan's idea while raising the legitimate concerns a medieval queen would have. She shouldn't simply agree - that would be unrealistic given her character and the social norms of the time. But she also shouldn't dismiss it outright, given that Juan has shown himself to be unconventional but wise.\n\nLet me think about what concerns she would raise:\n- Security - the king's children living outside the palace is a vulnerability\n- Social propriety - noble children playing with servants' children would be scandalous\n- The court's reaction - nobles would be offended, confused\n- Precedent - no king does this\n- The children's future - will they be prepared for their roles?\n\nBut she might also see merit:\n- She herself valued her rough-and-tumble childhood in Ferrara\n- She agrees Catalina needs more freedom\n- She trusts Juan's judgment on unconventional approaches\n- Doña Beatriz is trustworthy\n\nI'll have her engage seriously with the idea, raise concerns, but work with Juan to find a workable version of his vision.\n\n\nLucia is silent for a long moment. You can see her working through the idea—the Italian pragmatist weighing the radical proposal against everything she knows of court life, propriety, and the expectations of royalty.\n\n\n\"Juan,\" she says finally, her voice careful, \"I love you. And I have learned that when you propose something that sounds mad, there is usually wisdom beneath it. But...\"\n\n\nShe rises, pacing slowly before the window.\n\n\n\"You are the King of Castile. Defensor Romaniae. The man who took Granada and saved Constantinople. Your children are not... ordinary children. They cannot be, no matter how much we might wish it.\"\n\n\nShe turns to face you.\n\n\n\"If word spread that the royal children were living in a modest house, playing with servants' children, tumbling about unsupervised...\" She shakes her head. \"The grandees would be horrified. The Archbishop would lecture you about the dignity of the crown. Foreign ambassadors would report that the King of Castile has gone eccentric. And every noble family who hoped to place their daughter as a companion to the princess would be mortally offended that you preferred the company of stable boys and kitchen maids.\"\n\n\n\nBut then she pauses, tilting her head.\n\n\n\"And yet...\"\n\n\nShe moves back to her chair, sitting down slowly, her expression shifting from concern to contemplation.\n\n\n\"There is something in what you say. The palace is a place of work. Of ceremony. Of eyes always watching. I feel it myself—the weight of performance, every gesture observed and judged. For a child to grow up in that...\" She trails off. \"It would be suffocating. Is suffocating, I think, for Catalina already.\"\n\n\nShe is quiet for a moment, then speaks more slowly, thinking aloud.\n\n\n\"In Ferrara, the Este family had... country estates. Smaller houses outside the city where the children were sent in summer. Away from the worst of the court's formality. The rules were... looser there. We played with the children of the estate workers. Ran wild in the orchards. Came home muddy and sunburned and happy.\"\n\n\nHer eyes meet yours.\n\n\n\"It was not that we lived as peasants. We still had nurses, tutors, guards. But the atmosphere was different. Lighter. The servants' children knew we were the duke's nieces, but they also knew that in the apple orchard, rank mattered less than who could climb highest.\"\n\n\n\nShe leans forward, her tone becoming more engaged.\n\n\n\"Perhaps something like that could work here. Not abandoning the palace entirely—you need the children visible at court for ceremonies, for visiting dignitaries, for the rituals that bind the nobility to the crown. But a second residence. A royal estate, modest in size, perhaps a day's ride from Toledo. Close enough to return quickly if needed. Far enough to feel... separate.\"\n\n\n\"Doña Beatriz would be perfect to manage it. She raised you, did she not? She understands what you want for your children—and she has the authority to make lesser servants obey without constantly invoking your name.\"\n\n\n\"The children could spend much of their time there. Catalina especially, but the younger ones too as they grow. And yes—\" she nods slowly, warming to the idea, \"—there could be other children. Perhaps not only servants' children, which would cause too much scandal. But a mix. The sons and daughters of minor hidalgos who work the estate. The children of your more trusted household staff. A few noble companions for propriety's sake, but chosen for temperament rather than family connections.\"\n\n\n\nShe holds up a cautionary hand.\n\n\n\"But Juan—security. I must speak of it. Your children are targets. Kidnapping, assassination, leverage against you... these are not fantasies. They are the realities of royal life. Wherever the children live, there must be guards. Walls. Watchfulness. Not smothering—but protection.\"\n\n\n\"And we must be careful how we present this. Not 'the king is hiding his children among peasants.' Rather... 'the royal children enjoy the healthful air of the countryside, as is traditional for young princes and princesses.' Frame it as something normal, even admirable. Let the court believe we are following some ancient custom, not inventing something new.\"\n\n\nShe smiles slightly.\n\n\n\"You are good at that. Making the radical seem inevitable.\"\n\n\n\nFinally, she asks:\n\n\n\"Do you have a place in mind? An estate that might serve? Or shall we task someone with finding one—somewhere with good air, clean water, space for children to run, and walls strong enough to let me sleep at night?\""

That if a stranger ever tries to take her anywhere, she must scream, bite, kick, make herself impossible to move quietly.\"\n\n\nA shadow crosses her face. \"In Ferrara, we learned such things young. The Este family has enemies. My aunt told me when I was five: 'If anyone ever grabs you, become a wild animal. Noise is your weapon.' I thought it was a game at first. Later I understood.\"\n\n\nShe squeezes your hand. \"We can teach it lightly, as you say. Make it almost a game. But she must know. They all must know, as they grow old enough.\"\n\n\n\nOn the House\n\n\n\"Just outside Toledo is perfect. Close enough that you can visit daily if duties permit. Close enough that in an emergency, the city guard could reach us within the hour. But separate. A different world for the children to inhabit.\"\n\n\nShe considers the practical details. \"A house with grounds—gardens, perhaps a small orchard, space for animals. Children should know where food comes from. They should see chickens and goats and horses, not just the finished dishes that appear on silver plates.\"\n\n\n\"The other families inside the enclosure—yes, excellent. Not servants exactly, but... trusted households. Perhaps a steward's family. A retired knight with children of the right ages. A craftsman whose skills are useful and whose wife can help manage the household. People who are grateful for the security and comfort, who have reason to be loyal, whose children will grow up alongside ours.\"\n\n\nShe smiles. \"More eyes, as you say. And more ordinary life. Catalina will learn that not everyone lives in palaces. That most people work with their hands. That dignity does not require silk and gold.\"\n\n\n\nOn Education\n\n\nLucia's eyes brighten at this—education is something she cares about deeply.\n\n\n\"Greek and Latin, yes. She has a gift for languages—I have seen it already. She switches between Castilian and Portuguese without thinking, and she has picked up Italian phrases from me and my ladies. A mind like that should be fed, not starved.\"\n\n\n\"For Latin, perhaps one of the cathedral scholars? Someone who can teach grammar through stories rather than endless declension tables. Children learn faster when they do not realize they are learning.\"\n\n\n\"For Greek...\" She pauses thoughtfully. \"That is harder to find in Castile. But with your connections to Constantinople, surely there are Byzantine scholars who might welcome a position at the royal household? A Greek tutor would serve double purpose—teaching the language and teaching the children about the Eastern Empire, its history, its faith. Catalina may one day need to understand the Greeks as well as she understands the Castilians.\"\n\n\nShe nods firmly. \"And group lessons, absolutely. One-on-one instruction breeds arrogance. Catalina must learn that she is not always the cleverest person in the room—and if she is the cleverest, she must learn patience with those who are slower. Nothing teaches humility like watching a stable boy grasp a concept faster than you do.\"\n\n\n\nOn Faith\n\n\n\"A dedicated woman for religious instruction—this is important.\" Lucia's tone grows more careful here. \"Not just any nun. We need someone who can make the faith live for children. Who tells the stories of the saints as adventures, not lectures. Who explains why we pray, not just how.\"\n\n\nShe thinks for a moment. \"The Dominicans have educated women in their tertiary orders—lay sisters who have studied theology but live in the world. Or perhaps a widow of good family who has taken informal vows? Someone who knows both the sacred and the practical. Who can teach Catalina about the Virgin and also about what it means to be a Christian queen someday.\"\n\n\nA slight smile. \"Someone who will not bore her. Catalina's mind moves quickly. A dull teacher will lose her, and she will learn to associate faith with tedium. That would be a tragedy.\"\n\n\n\nOn Music\n\n\n\"The singing, yes, of course we continue.\" Lucia laughs softly. \"As if we could stop her! She sings constantly—to herself, to her siblings, to the servants. The choirmaster says he has never seen such natural ability in one so young.\"\n\n\n\"But we must be careful not to make it a burden. It is her joy now. If we turn it into endless lessons and performances for visiting dignitaries, it may become a chore. Let her sing because she loves it, not because she must.\"\n\n\nShe considers. \"Perhaps... informal musical gatherings? Other children learning instruments, singing together. Not performances—just play. Music should be shared, not displayed.\"\n\n\n\nLucia sits back, looking at you with an expression of mingled admiration and tenderness.\n\n\n\"You have thought about this carefully, haven't you? This is not a passing fancy.\"\n\n\nShe reaches up to touch your face briefly.\n\n\n\"You know what I think, Juan? I think you are trying to give your children something you did not have. A childhood that is... theirs. Not just preparation for the throne. Not just duty and expectation. But life.\"\n\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\n\"Isabel—your first queen—would approve. She wanted this for Catalina too, I think. I see it in the way Doña Beatriz speaks of her. She was not a woman who cared overmuch for ceremony.\"\n\n\nLucia stands, smoothing her skirts with brisk efficiency.\n\n\n\"Very well. Shall I begin making inquiries? For the house, for the tutors, for suitable families to join our little enclave? Doña Beatriz and I can manage the practical details. You have a kingdom to run, and a meeting with a Sultan to prepare for.\"\n\n\nShe raises an eyebrow. \"Unless you wish to interview Greek tutors personally?\""

This includes:\n\n1. Finding/buying and reinforcing a suitable house just outside Toledo\n2. Setting up security (special guards for the children)\n3. Finding trusted families to live within the enclosure\n4. Hiring tutors (Latin, Greek, religious instruction)\n5. Continuing music education\n6. Teaching the children safety awareness (screaming, etc.)\n7. How Catalina and the other children adapt to this new arrangement\n\nThis is a complex undertaking with many moving parts. I need to consider:\n\nFactors favoring success:\n- Royal resources and funding\n- Lucia's capable management\n- Doña Beatriz's experience raising Juan himself\n- Clear vision of what they want\n- Toledo area should have suitable properties\n- Byzantine connections for Greek tutors\n- Cathedral scholars available for Latin\n- Catalina is intelligent and adaptable\n- Younger children will know nothing else\n\nFactors against:\n- Finding the right property takes time\n- Greek tutors are rare in Castile\n- Noble families may be offended at being excluded\n- Court gossip and criticism\n- Finding the right balance of security without suffocation\n- Children's personalities may not mesh well\n- Some trusted families may not work out\n- Catalina may resist changes or have adjustment issues\n- Coordinating all the moving pieces\n\nThis is more of a domestic/organizational challenge than a dangerous one, so the table should reflect that. The worst outcomes are things not working out well, children being unhappy, security problems, or the arrangement causing political issues - not disasters or deaths.\n\nLet me draft the table.\n\n\nAutumn 1435 - Spring 1436\n\n\nLucia throws herself into the project with characteristic efficiency. Within days, she has Doña Beatriz reviewing properties, household stewards drawing up lists of suitable families, and discreet inquiries going out for tutors.\n\n\nThe work proceeds alongside the Salé preparations and the African outpost establishment—one more thread in the tapestry of the kingdom's business.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll: The Royal Children's Household (1435-1436)\n\n\nThe Plan:\n\n\nPurchase and reinforce a suitable house just outside Toledo\n\nEstablish security with dedicated guards trained for child protection\n\nInclude 3-4 trusted families within the enclosure as neighbors\n\nHire tutors: Latin scholar, Greek tutor (from Byzantine connections), religious instructor\n\nContinue music education with cathedral choirmaster\n\nTeach children age-appropriate safety awareness\n\nCreate an environment balancing security with freedom and normal childhood\n\n\nFactors Favoring Success:\n\n\nAmple royal resources—money is not a constraint\n\nLucia's organizational ability and genuine investment in the project\n\nDoña Beatriz's experience (she raised Juan himself)\n\nClear vision of goals, not vague aspirations\n\nToledo area has many suitable properties\n\nByzantine connections make Greek tutors accessible\n\nCathedral provides Latin scholars\n\nCatalina is intelligent, adaptable, and resilient\n\nYounger children (Fernando, Bianca, Teresa) will know nothing else\n\nThe plan is well-conceived—balancing multiple concerns\n\nNo urgency—time to do it properly\n\n\nFactors Against:\n\n\nNovel arrangement—no template to follow\n\nFinding the right property may take time\n\nGreek tutors comfortable with young children are rare\n\nSome noble families may resent exclusion from the princess's circle\n\nCourt gossip may frame this negatively\n\nGuards must balance vigilance with not frightening the children\n\nTrusted families must mesh well together—personality conflicts possible\n\nCatalina is nearly four—old enough to have opinions and resist change\n\nIntegrating children of different social stations has inherent tensions\n\nReligious instructor must be engaging, not merely pious—hard to find\n\nCoordinating many moving pieces simultaneously\n\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-5\nSignificant Problems: The arrangement struggles badly. Perhaps the property proves unsuitable after purchase (drainage problems, structural issues). Perhaps a trusted family causes trouble—theft, loose talk, conflict with others. Perhaps Catalina reacts poorly, becoming withdrawn or rebellious. Perhaps a security lapse occurs that, while not resulting in harm, exposes vulnerabilities and shakes confidence. The household limps along but requires substantial reorganization. Lucia is frustrated; you must intervene personally.\n6-12\nDisappointing Results: The physical arrangements work adequately, but the spirit of the thing is missing. The tutors are competent but uninspiring. The other children are present but no real friendships form. Catalina goes through the motions but seems no happier than at the palace. The guards, trying too hard, create an atmosphere of watchfulness that undermines the intended freedom. The household functions, but it feels like a smaller, duller version of court rather than something new. Adjustments needed.\n13-22\nMixed Outcomes: Some elements succeed, others disappoint. Perhaps the house and security are excellent, but suitable tutors prove elusive—the Latin teacher is pedantic, the Greek tutor does not arrive until late in the year, the religious instructor is pious but dull. Or perhaps the tutors are wonderful but the trusted families' children do not mesh well with the royal children. Catalina thrives in some ways but struggles in others. A partial success requiring patience and continued adjustment.\n23-38\nAdequate Success: The household is established and functions as intended, with the normal friction of any new undertaking. The property is suitable, the security adequate, the tutors competent. Catalina adjusts after an initial period of uncertainty. The other children provide some companionship, though deep friendships take time. The atmosphere is lighter than the palace, if not yet the idyllic childhood retreat you envisioned. A solid foundation that will improve with time.\n39-55\nGood Success: The plan comes together well. A suitable property is found—a modest manor house with gardens and orchards, easily reinforced. The trusted families integrate smoothly, their children proving good companions. The tutors are capable and reasonably engaging. Security is present but unobtrusive. Catalina blossoms noticeably—more relaxed, more childlike, forming her first real friendships with children who are not afraid to argue with her. The younger children thrive in the healthier environment. Lucia and Doña Beatriz work together seamlessly.\n56-70\nVery Good Success: Better than expected. The property is ideal—good air, ample space, defensible but not fortress-like. The trusted families become genuine friends of the household. An excellent Latin tutor is found, and a Byzantine scholar—displaced by troubles at home—proves a gifted teacher of Greek who enchants the children with stories of Constantinople. The religious instructor makes the saints come alive. Catalina transforms—still imperious at times, but learning to play, to lose gracefully, to be a child. Fernando, now old enough to toddle about, follows her everywhere. The household becomes what you hoped: a place of joy and growth.\n71-82\nExcellent Success: Everything aligns. The property—a small estate called Quinta de los Ángeles, perhaps—becomes a true home. The children flourish. Catalina forms a close friendship with a steward's daughter her own age—a girl clever enough to challenge her and confident enough not to be intimidated. The tutors are exceptional; Catalina's Greek progresses remarkably, and she begins reading simple texts within months. Her music continues to astonish. The younger children grow healthy and happy. Visitors remark on how different the atmosphere is from typical royal nurseries. The arrangement becomes a quiet model—other noble families begin to wonder if they should do something similar.\n83-91\nOutstanding Success: The household exceeds all hopes. The children thrive in ways that are visible to everyone. Catalina, given room to grow, reveals depths beyond her extraordinary voice—a quick mind, a generous heart, a natural leadership that inspires rather than demands. She teaches younger children their letters, organizes games, settles disputes with surprising fairness. The Greek tutor becomes devoted to the family. The religious instructor kindles genuine faith, not mere observance. Security becomes almost invisible—the guards know every face, every routine, and the children barely notice their presence. The Quinta becomes a haven that the children love and you find yourself visiting more often than duty requires, simply to be with your family.\n92-97\nExceptional Achievement: Beyond the immediate success, the arrangement yields unexpected benefits. Perhaps one of the trusted families' children proves extraordinarily gifted—a future scholar or administrator identified young. Perhaps the Greek tutor brings connections that prove valuable for Constantinople affairs. Perhaps Catalina, thriving in this environment, develops abilities that surprise everyone—not just her voice, but genuine intellectual gifts, emotional intelligence, even early signs of diplomatic instinct. The household becomes not just a happy home but a place where future servants of the crown are quietly being formed alongside the royal children.\n98-100\nTransformative Success: The household becomes something legendary—a place that future historians will write about as formative in shaping the extraordinary children of Juan II. The blend of freedom and structure, security and normalcy, royal dignity and common humanity creates young people of remarkable character. Catalina, Fernando, Bianca, and Teresa will carry the imprint of these years throughout their lives. Bonds formed here—between the royal children and their companions, between the family and their devoted tutors—will endure for decades. And you and Lucia find something unexpected: a family life that is genuinely yours, not a performance for the court, not a duty to the dynasty, but something real and precious. The crown grows lighter when you can set it aside sometimes and simply be a father.\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

The guards, trying too hard, create an atmosphere of watchfulness that undermines the intended freedom. The household functions, but it feels like a smaller, duller version of court rather than something new. Adjustments needed.\"\n\nI need to describe what happens, showing these problems unfolding, but stop when Juan would need to intervene - as per the GM rules about stopping and letting the player act.\n\n\nAutumn 1435 - Winter 1436\n\n\nThe project begins with such promise.\n\n\nLucia finds a property within a fortnight—a modest manor house called Casa de las Palomas, the House of Doves, a half-league outside Toledo's walls. It sits on a gentle rise with views of the Tagus valley, surrounded by almond orchards and a walled garden. The previous owner, a wealthy merchant who died without heirs, kept it well-maintained. The price is reasonable.\n\n\nReinforcement of the walls proceeds smoothly. A new gatehouse is added, the perimeter extended to include a cluster of smaller buildings that will house the trusted families. By November, the physical work is largely complete. The house is comfortable, defensible without feeling like a fortress, and blessedly quiet compared to the Alcázar.\n\n\nThree families are selected to join the household:\n\n\nRodrigo de Salazar, a retired sergeant from the Granada campaign, his wife María, and their two children—a boy of five named Pedro and a girl of three named Inés\n\nGonzalo the steward, a palace administrator of proven loyalty, with his wife and son, age six\n\nA widowed seamstress named Ana, whose skill with needle and thread is matched by her reputation for discretion, with her daughter of four\n\n\nThe guards are chosen carefully—eight men who served in Granada, vetted by Álvaro de Luna himself. Their captain, a grizzled veteran named Sebastián, understands his orders: protect the children without smothering them.\n\n\nThe tutors arrive in December. Fray Ambrosio, a Franciscan from the cathedral school, will teach Latin. A Byzantine deacon named Father Nikephoros, recommended by contacts in Constantinople, arrives to teach Greek. Sister Margarita, a Dominican tertiary of good family, will provide religious instruction.\n\n\nBy Christmas, the household is assembled. Lucia moves the children—Catalina, Fernando, Bianca, and the infant Teresa—to Casa de las Palomas with great ceremony. Doña Beatriz takes up residence as head of the household, her authority unquestioned.\n\n\nEverything is in place.\n\n\n\nThe Problems Begin\n\n\nYou visit in January, eager to see how the children are settling in.\n\n\nSomething is wrong.\n\n\nThe house is quiet—too quiet. Not the peaceful quiet of contentment, but the strained silence of people being careful. Servants move with exaggerated caution. The guards stand at rigid attention, eyes scanning constantly, hands never far from their weapons.\n\n\nCatalina is in the schoolroom with the other children. You observe from the doorway, unannounced.\n\n\nFray Ambrosio drones through a Latin grammar lesson. His voice is flat, mechanical. The children sit in rows—the royal children in front, the others behind—reciting declensions in a joyless chorus. Catalina's face is blank, her responses automatic. The steward's son stares out the window. Little Inés, the sergeant's daughter, looks like she might cry from boredom.\n\n\nThere is no spark. No curiosity. No life.\n\n\nYou find Father Nikephoros in the garden, sitting alone. He is a young man, perhaps thirty, with the hollow eyes of someone far from home. When you approach, he rises hastily and bows too deeply.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty. I—I did not expect—\"\n\n\nHis Castilian is heavily accented, hesitant. You try Greek, and he relaxes slightly, but only slightly. He speaks of his lessons with careful formality. Yes, the princess is learning. Yes, she is intelligent. Yes, everything proceeds adequately.\n\n\nBut when you ask if Catalina enjoys the lessons, he hesitates.\n\n\n\"She is... obedient, Majesty. Very obedient.\"\n\n\nThat word lands like a stone.\n\n\n\nYou find Doña Beatriz in the kitchens, supervising the evening meal. She sees your expression and dismisses the servants with a gesture.\n\n\n\"You've seen,\" she says quietly. It is not a question.\n\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\nShe sighs, suddenly looking every one of her years.\n\n\n\"Nothing happened, Juan. That is the problem.\" She wipes her hands on her apron—a gesture from her days as your nurse, before you were king. \"The pieces are all here. The house is lovely. The tutors are qualified. The families are good people. The guards are competent. But...\"\n\n\nShe struggles for words.\n\n\n\"It is like a painting of a household, not a real one. Everyone is so careful. So aware of who is royal and who is not. The other children barely speak to Catalina—they are terrified of saying the wrong thing. The tutors teach at the children, not with them. The guards watch everything so intently that everyone feels watched.\"\n\n\nShe meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"Captain Sebastián is a good man, but he treats this posting like a military campaign. Every visitor is a potential threat. Every game is a security risk. Yesterday Catalina wanted to climb the almond tree in the garden—just climb it, like any child would—and two guards materialized instantly to stand beneath it, ready to catch her if she fell. She came down after three branches and went inside.\"\n\n\nDoña Beatriz's voice cracks slightly.\n\n\n\"She doesn't laugh anymore, Juan. Not like she used to. She goes through the motions—lessons, meals, prayers, bed—but the sunshine has gone out of her. And the other children...\" She shakes her head. \"They huddle together, whispering, while Catalina sits alone. They are not unkind. They are just... afraid of her. Of what it might mean to be her friend.\"\n\n\n\nThat evening, you observe dinner.\n\n\nThe children eat at a long table, the royal children at one end, the others at the other. Conversation is minimal and stilted. Catalina pushes food around her plate. When little Inés accidentally knocks over her cup, her mother—the sergeant's wife—goes pale with mortification and scolds the child sharply. Inés bursts into tears. Catalina watches with an expression you cannot read.\n\n\nSister Margarita leads evening prayers. Her voice is gentle, her words correct, but she speaks to the children as though addressing a congregation, not as a grandmother telling beloved stories. The prayers end. The children are led to bed.\n\n\nYou find Catalina in her chamber, Doña Beatriz tucking her in. The old woman withdraws when she sees you.\n\n\nCatalina looks up at you with grey eyes—Isabel's eyes, you are reminded with a pang.\n\n\n\"Papa?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, mija?\"\n\n\nA long pause. Then, very quietly:\n\n\n\"Can I come back to the palace?\"\n\n\n\nYou return to Toledo that night, your mind heavy.\n\n\nLucia is waiting. She has heard already—Doña Beatriz sent a messenger.\n\n\n\"I thought we had planned it so carefully,\" she says, her voice tight with frustration. \"The right house. The right people. The right tutors. How did it become... this?\"\n\n\nShe paces before the fire.\n\n\n\"Fray Ambrosio was recommended by the Archbishop himself. Father Nikephoros came with letters of praise from the Patriarch's household. Sister Margarita is from one of the finest families in Castile. Captain Sebastián defended the walls of Alhama against three assaults. They are all excellent at what they do.\"\n\n\nShe stops, turning to face you.\n\n\n\"But excellent is not what we needed, is it? We needed... warmth. Joy. People who remember how to be children, or at least how to be with children.\" She sinks into a chair. \"I chose with my head, not my heart. I chose credentials over character.\"\n\n\nShe looks at you, her grey-green eyes troubled.\n\n\n\"What do we do, Juan? Start over? Replace everyone? Catalina asked to come back to the palace—that breaks my heart. But bringing her back means admitting defeat. It means she grows up in the Alcázar after all, surrounded by ceremony and politics.\"\n\n\nShe waits.\n\n\n\"What do you want to do?\""

We were not expecting—\"\n\n\n\"Gather everyone,\" you tell him. \"The entire household.

Captain Sebastián stands at their head, his weathered face unreadable.\n\n\nThe servants cluster near the door—kitchen maids, a groom, the cook—ready to flee back to their duties at the first opportunity.\n\n\nThe trusted families stand in the center, uncertainty written on their faces. Rodrigo the sergeant has his hand on his son Pedro's shoulder, gripping perhaps too tightly. His wife María holds little Inés, who buries her face in her mother's skirts. Gonzalo the steward stands stiffly beside his wife, their son Gonzalito fidgeting despite his father's warning glances. Ana the seamstress keeps her daughter Lucía close, the girl's eyes wide and frightened.\n\n\nThe tutors occupy their own corner. Fray Ambrosio clutches his prayer book like a shield. Father Nikephoros stands apart, his dark eyes watchful, his posture that of a man accustomed to courts and their dangers. Sister Margarita's hands are folded serenely, but her knuckles are white.\n\n\nAnd at the front, with Doña Beatriz, stand your children. A wet nurse holds Teresa. Bianca drowses in another nurse's arms. Fernando, two years old and oblivious to the tension, is trying to escape Doña Beatriz's grip to explore the room.\n\n\nCatalina stands very still. She is dressed formally—someone anticipated your visit and prepared her—in a small gown of blue velvet, her dark hair brushed and ribboned. She looks like a portrait of a princess.\n\n\nShe does not look like a child.\n\n\n\nThe Announcement\n\n\nYou let the silence stretch for a moment, then speak.\n\n\n\"Tomorrow, we leave for a camping trip. All of us—every person in this room except the kitchen staff, who will remain to tend the house. We will travel into the hills, make camp, hunt, forage, sleep under the stars. We will be gone four days, perhaps five.\"\n\n\nConfusion ripples through the room. This is not what anyone expected.\n\n\n\"We will take one master huntsman to guide us. A few servants for the heaviest work. But everyone else comes as they are—not as guards, not as tutors, not as sergeant or steward or seamstress. As people. As families.\"\n\n\nYou look at Captain Sebastián.\n\n\n\"Captain. You and three of your men will accompany us—at a distance. You will make camp nearby but not among us. If there is trouble, you will hear us call. Otherwise, you will not be seen.\"\n\n\nSebastián's jaw tightens almost imperceptibly, but he nods. \"As Your Majesty commands.\"\n\n\nYou turn to the tutors.\n\n\n\"Fray Ambrosio, Father Nikephoros—you will remain here. Use the time for prayer and reflection. Consider how lessons might be taught... differently.\"\n\n\nThe Franciscan blinks. The Greek deacon's expression flickers—is that relief? Hope?\n\n\n\"Sister Margarita.\" You meet her eyes. \"You will come with us. The children should learn that faith lives in forests as well as chapels.\"\n\n\nShe inclines her head. \"Your Majesty.\"\n\n\n\nThe Children\n\n\nYou step forward, past the adults, and lower yourself to one knee before the cluster of children. This puts you at their eye level—something kings rarely do.\n\n\nThe effect is immediate. The adults shift uncomfortably. The children stare.\n\n\n\"I want to ask each of you a question,\" you say, keeping your voice gentle. \"And I want you to answer honestly. Not what you think I want to hear. Not what your parents told you to say. The truth.\"\n\n\nYou look at each small face in turn.\n\n\n\"What do you like to do most?\"\n\n\n\nGonzalito (age 6)\n\n\nThe steward's son is the oldest. He glances at his father—Gonzalo gives a tiny, uncertain nod—then swallows hard.\n\n\n\"I... I like climbing, Your Majesty.\" His voice is barely a whisper. \"Trees. Walls. Roofs.\" A pause, then a rush of confession: \"Father says I'll break my neck. But I like seeing everything from up high.\"\n\n\nHis father's face cycles through mortification, fear, and resignation in the space of a heartbeat.\n\n\n\nPedro (age 5)\n\n\nThe sergeant's son is sturdier than Gonzalito, with his father's watchful eyes. He squares his small shoulders like a soldier reporting for duty.\n\n\n\"Sword fighting,\" he says firmly. \"With sticks. I want to be a knight like Father was. Was a sergeant,\" he corrects himself quickly. \"Father was a sergeant, not a knight. But I want to be a knight.\"\n\n\nRodrigo's grip on his son's shoulder softens slightly.\n\n\n\nLucía (age 4)\n\n\nThe seamstress's daughter is a wisp of a girl with tangled brown hair and ink-stained fingers. She shrinks back when your attention falls on her, pressing against her mother's legs.\n\n\n\"It's all right,\" Ana murmurs, stroking her hair. \"Tell the king.\"\n\n\nA long silence. Then, almost inaudibly: \"Drawing.\"\n\n\n\"Drawing?\" you prompt gently.\n\n\nShe nods, not meeting your eyes. \"I draw pictures. Of birds. And horses. And...\" She trails off, suddenly terrified that she has said too much.\n\n\n\nInés (age 3)\n\n\nThe sergeant's daughter is the youngest of the playmates, still half-hidden in her mother's skirts. When you turn to her, she burrows deeper.\n\n\n\"Inés,\" María coaxes. \"The king asked you a question, cariño.\"\n\n\nTwo enormous brown eyes peek out. A thumb goes into her mouth.\n\n\n\"'Nimas,\" she mumbles around it.\n\n\n\"Animals,\" her mother translates, half-apologetic. \"She loves animals, Your Majesty. She tries to catch every cat, dog, and chicken she sees. She cried for an hour when a bird flew away from her.\"\n\n\n\nCatalina (age 3, nearly 4)\n\n\nYour daughter has watched each exchange with that careful, assessing gaze that is so unlike a normal child's. When you turn to her, she does not flinch or fidget. She simply waits.\n\n\n\"Catalina. What do you like to do most?\"\n\n\nA pause. The room holds its breath.\n\n\n\"I like singing,\" she says. Her voice is clear, composed—a princess giving an appropriate answer.\n\n\n\"I know you like singing, mija. Everyone knows that. But what else? What do you like that isn't... expected of you?\"\n\n\nSomething flickers in her grey eyes—surprise, perhaps, that you saw through her first answer.\n\n\nA longer pause.\n\n\n\"I like stories,\" she says finally, and this time her voice is smaller, younger. \"Stories about adventures. About people who go places and do things.\" She hesitates, then adds in a rush: \"And I like mud. Making things out of mud. But Doña Beatriz says princesses don't play in mud.\"\n\n\nBehind her, Doña Beatriz closes her eyes briefly.\n\n\n\nFernando (age 2)\n\n\nYour son has finally escaped Doña Beatriz's grip and is investigating a fascinating beetle near the hearth. When you call his name, he looks up with cheerful incomprehension.\n\n\n\"Nando. What do you like?\"\n\n\nHe considers this question with the gravity of a two-year-old, then points at the beetle.\n\n\n\"Bug,\" he announces proudly.\n\n\nDespite everything—despite the tension, the failure, the weight of what must be fixed—you find yourself smiling.\n\n\n\nThe room is still. The children have spoken. The adults wait, uncertain what any of this means.\n\n\nYou rise from your knee and look around at the assembled household—the anxious parents, the rigid guards, the bewildered tutors, the watchful servants.\n\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" you say. \"We leave at dawn. Pack light. Bring warm clothes. Leave your ranks behind.\"\n\n\nYou pause at the door, turning back.\n\n\n\"And someone find Lucía some paper and charcoal. Pedro, a good stick for sword practice. Gonzalito—\" you glance at the steward's pale face, \"—we'll find some trees worth climbing. Inés will help us look for animals. Fernando can hunt for bugs.\"\n\n\nYour eyes find Catalina.\n\n\n\"And we'll tell stories by the fire. Adventures. About people who go places and do things.\"\n\n\nShe stares at you. For a moment—just a moment—the composed little princess cracks, and you see the child underneath.\n\n\n\"And mud?\" she asks, very quietly.\n\n\n\"And mud.\""

She has been watching from the doorway, her expression shifting from surprise to understanding to something approaching admiration.\n\n\n\"A cape,\" she repeats, a smile tugging at her lips. \"For the young knight.\"\n\n\nShe thinks for a moment. \"Not a full ceremonial cape—that would overwhelm the boy and make the others jealous. But...\" Her eyes brighten. \"I have a length of red wool in my trunks. Good quality, but not ostentatious. Enough to make small capes for all the children—red for the boys who wish to play knight, perhaps blue or green for the girls if they prefer something else. That way Pedro feels special, but no one feels excluded.\"\n\n\nShe pauses, her practical mind already working. \"We could present them as... expedition cloaks. For the adventure. Every explorer needs a cloak. The children can wear them on the journey, get them muddy, tear them on branches—it does not matter. They are theirs, not borrowed finery to be kept pristine.\"\n\n\nHer smile widens. \"And if Catalina wishes to play knight alongside Pedro and Gonzalito, she may have a red cape too. No reason a princess cannot be a knight in a game.\"\n\n\nShe squeezes your arm. \"I will have Ana the seamstress begin immediately. Simple work—she can finish them by tonight if she starts now. It will give her something to do besides worry about what this trip means for her position.\"\n\n\n\nThe Master Huntsman\n\n\nYou find him in the stables, already preparing gear for tomorrow's departure.\n\n\nMartín de Valdés is a lean, weathered man in his fifties who has served the crown for thirty years. He knows every forest and hill within a week's ride of Toledo, and he has the quiet confidence of a man who is utterly competent in his domain. He bows as you approach, but without the nervous deference of the household staff—huntsmen learn early that nature does not care about rank.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty. I am told we are taking the children into the hills.\"\n\n\n\"We are. And I have a question for you.\"\n\n\nHe listens as you explain—live animals for the children to observe, to play with, to draw.\n\n\nMartín strokes his grey-stubbled chin thoughtfully.\n\n\n\"Capture live, not kill. That is harder than hunting, Majesty, but it can be done.\" He begins ticking off possibilities on calloused fingers.\n\n\n\"Rabbits—easy enough. We can set snares tonight and check them at first light. Young rabbits especially are docile once caught. The children can hold them, pet them, and we release them after.\"\n\n\n\"Songbirds—harder, but possible with the right traps. I have lime-sticks and a mist net. Small finches, sparrows. They frighten easily, so the children must be gentle and quiet, but a bird in the hand is a wonder for a child who has never held one.\"\n\n\n\"A hedgehog, perhaps, if we are lucky. They curl into balls when frightened—harmless and fascinating. Children love them.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, considering. \"If we are very fortunate, we might find a fox den with cubs. Too young to be dangerous, old enough to be playful. But we would only observe, not capture—vixen mothers are protective and the cubs need their mother.\"\n\n\nA thoughtful look crosses his face. \"There is also the river, three leagues into the hills. Shallow pools where we might catch small fish with our hands, or tadpoles and frogs. The little ones especially would enjoy that—wading in the water, chasing things that slip through their fingers.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you directly, huntsman to king. \"May I speak plainly, Majesty?\"\n\n\nYou nod.\n\n\n\"The best way to capture animals for children is to let the children help capture them. Show them how to move quietly. How to set a simple snare. How to cup their hands in the water and wait for a fish to swim close. They will remember catching a rabbit themselves far longer than they will remember a rabbit handed to them already caught.\"\n\n\nHe hesitates, then adds: \"And it teaches patience. Stillness. Observation. A child who learns to wait for a wild thing to come close has learned something that will serve them all their lives—in hunting, in war, in diplomacy.\" A slight smile. \"Or so my father told me, when I was younger than your daughter.\"\n\n\n\nDoña Beatriz appears at your elbow. \"The household is in an uproar, Juan. A good uproar, I think—the kind that comes from unexpected hope rather than fear. But there are questions.\"\n\n\nShe holds up a hand, counting. \"How many tents? What food do we bring? Are the infants coming or staying? Should Sister Margarita bring her prayer books or leave them? And Captain Sebastián wishes to know—\" her voice carries a hint of long-suffering patience, \"—whether he should bring full armor or merely brigandine for his reduced guard detail.\"\n\n\nShe raises an eyebrow. \"Shall I handle the logistics, or do you wish to give further instructions?\""

I approve entirely.\"\n\n\nShe turns to go, then pauses. \"Juan... this is good. What you are doing. I should have seen it myself—that we were building a prettier cage, not a home. I am sorry.\"\n\n\nBefore you can respond, she is already moving, calling out orders with the crisp efficiency of a woman who has managed royal households for decades.\n\n\n\nThat Evening\n\n\nThe Casa de las Palomas transforms.\n\n\nAna the seamstress works by candlelight, her needle flying through red and blue wool. By midnight, seven small cloaks hang ready—expedition cloaks, as Lucia suggested, simple but sturdy, sized for children's shoulders.\n\n\nThe kitchen staff packs provisions: hard cheese, dried sausage, bread that will keep, a cask of wine for the adults, fresh apples for everyone. Enough for five days, though Martín de Valdés assures you that the hills will provide if the children prove apt pupils.\n\n\nCaptain Sebastián, after a tense negotiation with Doña Beatriz, agrees to a compromise: he and three guards will shadow the party at a distance, wearing leather jerkins rather than mail, carrying swords but no polearms. A second group of six soldiers will establish a watch-camp a quarter league from wherever you make your main camp—close enough to respond to trouble, far enough to be invisible.\n\n\n\"I do not like it,\" he admits privately. \"But I understand what you are trying to do, Majesty. The children cannot breathe with us standing over them. I will keep them safe from a distance.\"\n\n\nFather Nikephoros finds you in the courtyard as the stars emerge. He hovers uncertainly, clearly wanting to speak but unsure if he should.\n\n\n\"You wished to say something, Father?\"\n\n\nThe Greek deacon hesitates. \"Your Majesty... I was told to remain behind. To reflect on how to teach differently.\" His Castilian is halting, but his meaning is clear. \"I have been reflecting already. Since I arrived, I have taught the princess as I was taught in Constantinople—formally, correctly, without joy. Because that is how scholars teach.\"\n\n\nHe looks at the ground. \"But I remember my grandfather. He taught me Greek not from books, but from stories. Heroes and monsters. Gods and mortals. I loved those stories before I could read them.\" He swallows. \"When you return, Majesty... perhaps I might try teaching that way? If you will permit it.\"\n\n\n\nDawn\n\n\nThe morning breaks clear and cold, the sky streaked with pink above the eastern hills.\n\n\nThe party assembles in the courtyard: adults, children, a train of pack mules carrying tents and provisions. Martín de Valdés sits his horse at the head of the column, calm and patient.\n\n\nThe children emerge in their new cloaks—red for Pedro and Gonzalito, who immediately begin swatting at each other with imaginary swords; blue for Lucía and Inés, who clutch theirs shyly; red, after a moment's hesitation, for Catalina, who runs her fingers over the wool as though it were made of gold.\n\n\n\"An expedition cloak,\" Lucia tells her, kneeling to fasten the clasp. \"For brave explorers.\"\n\n\nFernando, not understanding but determined to participate, has been given a tiny green cloak that he keeps trying to put in his mouth. The infants are bundled warmly in a covered litter that will travel with the mules.\n\n\nSister Margarita appears with a small satchel—her prayer book, you assume, and perhaps a few other necessities. She looks... different this morning. Less formal. She has exchanged her usual severe wimple for a simpler head covering, and there is a hint of anticipation in her eyes.\n\n\n\"I have not slept under stars since I was a girl,\" she admits quietly. \"My father took us into the hills once, when I was younger than Inés. I had forgotten how much I loved it.\"\n\n\n\nThe column moves out as the sun clears the horizon. Toledo shrinks behind you. The road gives way to trails, the trails to open country, the cultivated fields to wild hillsides dotted with oak and pine.\n\n\nThe children ride in a wagon at first, but within an hour, Pedro and Gonzalito are begging to walk. Then Catalina joins them. Then little Lucía, holding her mother's hand but determined not to be left out.\n\n\nOnly Inés remains in the wagon, thumb in mouth, watching a hawk circle overhead with rapt attention.\n\n\n\"'Nimal,\" she announces, pointing. \"Big bird.\"\n\n\nMartín de Valdés rides back alongside the wagon, following her gaze. \"A red kite,\" he tells her. \"She is hunting for mice in the grass. See how she hovers? Waiting, watching. Very patient.\"\n\n\nInés stares at the huntsman with something approaching awe—an adult who knows about animals and is willing to talk about them.\n\n\n\nBy midday, you have left all signs of civilization behind. The hills roll green and gold around you, scattered with wild olive and juniper. A stream glitters in a valley below, promising water and perhaps fish.\n\n\nMartín reins in beside you. \"A good spot for camp, Majesty. Sheltered, with water, and I know these woods—there are rabbits in the thickets to the north, and the stream holds trout. If we set snares this afternoon, we eat well tonight.\"\n\n\nHe glances back at the children, who have formed a ragged cluster around the wagon—tired from walking but too excited to admit it.\n\n\n\"With your permission, I will take the older ones to set snares before supper. Teach them to move quietly, to read the signs. The little ones can hunt for frogs by the stream with their mothers.\" A weathered smile. \"By tonight, Majesty, they will be too exhausted to remember who is royal and who is not.\"\n\n\n\nShall I draft a d100 table for how the camping trip unfolds, or would you like to play through specific moments first?"

But here, in a small clearing where the grass is soft and the stream murmurs nearby, you have gathered the children.\n\n\nThey stand in a loose semicircle before you, still wearing their expedition cloaks despite the midday warmth. Their faces are flushed from the morning's walk, their shoes dusty, their careful court manners already beginning to fray at the edges.\n\n\nGonzalito (6) stands at the edge of the group, his eyes drifting toward a massive oak tree at the edge of the clearing. Its lower branches hang invitingly, practically begging to be climbed. He keeps glancing at it, then guiltily back at you.\n\n\nPedro (5) has found a stick somewhere on the march—a good one, straight and sturdy—and is gripping it like a sword. He stands at attention, clearly hoping that whatever comes next involves hitting something.\n\n\nLucía (4) has her arms wrapped around herself, her new blue cloak clutched tight. She watches you with wide, uncertain eyes, but there is something else there too—a flicker of curiosity, perhaps hope. Her fingers are already dirty; she has been picking up interesting stones along the trail.\n\n\nCatalina (nearly 4) stands slightly apart from the others, as she has been trained to do. Her red cloak is immaculate—she has been careful with it, treating it as something precious. She watches you with that assessing gaze, waiting to see what kind of game this is, whether the rules have truly changed or whether this is just another test.\n\n\nInés (3) has found a caterpillar on a leaf and is utterly absorbed in watching it inch along. She seems to have forgotten that anything else exists.\n\n\nFernando (2) is sitting in the grass nearby, methodically pulling up fistfuls of it and examining each handful with intense concentration before discarding it and reaching for more.\n\n\nMartín de Valdés stands at a respectful distance, waiting. The mothers hover nearby—María, Ana, Gonzalo's wife—uncertain whether to intervene or observe. Sister Margarita has found a rock to sit on, her prayer book unopened in her lap.\n\n\nSix pairs of eyes—five, really, since Inés is still focused on her caterpillar—turn toward you, waiting."

I can climb! I'm the best climber!\" The words tumble out before he can stop them, court manners forgotten entirely. Then he catches himself, remembers who he is speaking to, and adds in a smaller voice: \"...Your Majesty. If it please you.\"\n\n\nPedro looks torn. He wants to volunteer—he wants to do everything—but climbing is Gonzalito's domain, and some boyish code of honor holds him back.

They are doing it together.\n\n\nGonzalito, for his part, is practically vibrating with excitement. The prospect of not only climbing but having a companion in the endeavor—and royal permission besides—has overwhelmed whatever shyness remained.\n\n\n\"I can show him the good branches!\" he bursts out. \"I know which ones hold and which ones crack. Pedro, you have to test them first with your foot before you put your weight on—\" He stops abruptly, remembering himself, and looks to you for permission to continue.\n\n\nLucía watches the two boys with quiet relief. She will not have to climb. But her eyes drift to the base of the tree, where interesting roots twist through the soil, where moss grows in soft patches, where—perhaps—there might be insects or stones worth drawing.\n\n\nCatalina still has not spoken. But she has taken one small step forward. Her eyes move from Gonzalito to Pedro to the tree itself. Her chin lifts slightly—that imperial little gesture she has learned from watching adults.\n\n\nShe is deciding something."

He reaches the oak in seconds, his small hands already finding purchase on the rough bark. He scrambles up the trunk with the ease of long practice, feet finding knotholes and crevices as if by instinct.\n\n\n\"This branch!\" he calls down, already five feet off the ground. \"Pedro, put your foot here, see where the bark is worn? That's the good spot!\"\n\n\nPedro follows more cautiously, his stick tucked into his belt like a sword. He is not a natural climber—his movements are deliberate, careful, each handhold tested before he commits. But he is determined. His tongue pokes out from the corner of his mouth in concentration as he pulls himself onto the first branch.\n\n\n\"I'm coming,\" he grunts. \"Wait for me.\"\n\n\nThe mothers have clustered together, hands clasped, faces tight with suppressed anxiety. María—Pedro's mother—looks like she might faint. But Rodrigo, the sergeant, puts a quiet hand on her arm and shakes his head slightly. Let him.\n\n\nGonzalo the steward watches his son with an expression you cannot quite read. Pride, perhaps. Or wonder. When did his boy learn to climb like that?\n\n\nLucía has drifted toward the base of the tree, her eyes on the ground. She crouches down, examining something in the moss—a beetle, perhaps, or an interesting stone. Her fingers twitch toward the drawing materials she knows are packed somewhere in the supplies.\n\n\nInés has finally looked up from her caterpillar. She watches the boys climbing with her mouth hanging open, thumb forgotten. \"'Nito is a squirrel,\" she breathes in awe.\n\n\nFernando has lost interest in grass and is now attempting to eat a small rock. One of the nurses moves to intercept him.\n\n\nAnd then—\n\n\nCatalina steps forward.\n\n\nShe walks to the base of the oak tree and stops, looking up at the boys. Gonzalito is already ten feet up, Pedro struggling gamely behind him. The lowest branch is above her head, rough bark and green leaves dappled with sunlight.\n\n\nShe reaches up and touches the trunk. Her small fingers trace the bark, feeling its texture. She has never touched a tree like this—not to climb it, only to admire from a safe distance while nurses hovered nearby.\n\n\nShe looks back over her shoulder. At you. At Doña Beatriz, who has gone very pale. At the other children. At the mothers who are watching with barely concealed alarm.\n\n\nHer grey eyes—Isabel's eyes—meet yours.\n\n\nShe does not ask permission. She is a princess. Princesses do not ask permission.\n\n\nBut she is also nearly four years old, and she has never climbed anything higher than a staircase, and she does not know how to begin.\n\n\nShe waits."

I should describe how Gonzalito responds, how Catalina attempts the climb with his help, and what the other characters do and say.\n\nThis is a pivotal moment - Catalina, the princess, is about to climb a tree for the first time with the help of a steward's son. The social dynamics here are significant. I should capture the reactions of the adults (especially Doña Beatriz and the parents) as well as the children.\n\n\nThe Oak Tree\n\n\nGonzalito freezes on his branch, looking down. For a moment, the confidence drains from his face. This is the princess. The king's daughter. If she falls, if she gets hurt, if he does something wrong—\n\n\nBut then something shifts. You have asked him. The king has asked him, Gonzalito, the steward's son who gets scolded for climbing, to help. To teach. To be the expert.\n\n\nHe descends rapidly, half-climbing, half-sliding down to the lowest branch. He hangs there by his hands, his feet dangling perhaps four feet off the ground, and looks at Catalina with an expression of intense seriousness.\n\n\n\"You have to grab here first,\" he says, pointing to a knot in the trunk at about her shoulder height. \"Both hands. Grip hard—harder than you think. The bark is rough but it won't hurt if you hold tight.\"\n\n\nCatalina looks at the knot. She reaches up. Her small hands wrap around it, knuckles whitening.\n\n\n\"Good,\" Gonzalito says. \"Now put your foot there—see that bumpy part? Push up with your legs, not your arms. Arms get tired fast. Legs are stronger.\"\n\n\nPedro has stopped his own ascent to watch from above, clinging to a branch with unconscious ease now that his attention is elsewhere. \"You can do it!\" he calls down. \"It's not as hard as it looks!\"\n\n\nCatalina pushes. Her foot slips. She tries again. Her shoe finds purchase on the rough bark.\n\n\n\"Now the other hand—reach up to me,\" Gonzalito instructs, extending his arm downward. \"I'll pull, you push. Ready? One, two—\"\n\n\nShe reaches. He grabs her wrist. She pushes with her legs.\n\n\nAnd then Catalina of Trastámara, Princess of Castile, daughter of a king and a queen, is sitting on the lowest branch of an oak tree, breathing hard, her blue velvet dress smudged with bark dust and lichen.\n\n\nHer red cloak has twisted sideways. A strand of dark hair has escaped its ribbons. Her cheeks are flushed.\n\n\nShe looks down at the ground—only five feet below, but it might as well be a mountaintop—and then up at Gonzalito and Pedro above her, and something breaks open in her face.\n\n\nShe laughs.\n\n\nNot the polite, practiced laugh of the court. A real laugh—surprised, delighted, slightly wild. The laugh of a child who has just discovered something wonderful.\n\n\n\"I'm climbing,\" she says, as if she cannot quite believe it.\n\n\n\"You're climbing,\" Gonzalito confirms, grinning. \"Want to go higher? There's a really good branch up here where you can see everything.\"\n\n\nBelow, Doña Beatriz has pressed a hand to her heart. Tears are streaming silently down her weathered cheeks—though whether from terror or joy, it is impossible to say.\n\n\nLucía has looked up from her beetles, watching the princess in the tree with something like wonder. If she can climb...\n\n\nInés is tugging at her mother's skirt. \"Mama. Mama. I want to climb. The princess is climbing. Can I climb?\"\n\n\nMaría looks desperately toward you."

At Catalina on the first branch, now reaching for the second with Gonzalito's guidance. At Pedro higher still, peering down through the leaves.\n\n\nShe looks at her mother, whose face has gone the color of fresh cheese.\n\n\nThen back at you.\n\n\nVery slowly, she nods. Her thumb completes its journey to her mouth, but around it, she mumbles: \"Want to climb. Like the princess.\"\n\n\nShe takes one tentative step toward the tree. Then another. She is so small—barely three years old, all skinny limbs and tangled hair and that ever-present thumb.\n\n\nShe stops at the base of the oak and tilts her head all the way back, looking up at the branches as though they were the towers of a castle. From her perspective, it must seem impossibly high.\n\n\nHer lower lip trembles.\n\n\nShe looks back at you, seeking reassurance. Her free hand reaches out—not toward the tree, but toward you."

Her small fingers scrabble at the bark, finding purchase. For a moment she clings there, terrified, legs dangling.\n\n\nThen Catalina's voice comes from above: \"Put your foot on the bumpy part. Like I did.\"\n\n\nInés looks up. The princess is watching her. Helping her. The princess, who has only ever been a distant figure of awe, someone to curtsy to and never speak to directly.\n\n\nInés puts her foot on the bumpy part.\n\n\nShe pulls herself up, belly scraping against the bark, and then she is sitting on the branch, breathing hard, her thumb immediately returning to her mouth. She does not try to go higher. She does not need to. She is in the tree, and that is miracle enough.\n\n\n\"I climbed,\" she whispers around her thumb, to no one in particular. \"Mama, I climbed.\"\n\n\nMaría has both hands pressed over her mouth. Rodrigo has his arm around her shoulders, and he is smiling—actually smiling, the stern sergeant transformed into a proud father.\n\n\n\nThe Climbing Party\n\n\nThe oak tree now holds four children at varying heights.\n\n\nGonzalito has reached his promised vantage point—a broad branch perhaps fifteen feet up where the trunk forks. He sits there like a prince surveying his domain, legs swinging freely, utterly at home.\n\n\n\"I can see the stream!\" he calls down. \"It's that way—\" he points through the leaves, \"—and there's a place where it gets wide and shallow. And I can see hills and hills and hills. And—\" he squints, \"—I think that's smoke from a shepherd's fire, way far away.\"\n\n\nPedro has settled on a branch two feet below Gonzalito, his stick-sword tucked securely in his belt. He is not as comfortable as his companion, but he refuses to show it. His jaw is set, his hands grip the branch firmly, and he stares out at the horizon with the expression of a knight surveying a battlefield.\n\n\n\"A knight needs to know the land,\" he announces to no one in particular. \"Father says so.\"\n\n\nCatalina has climbed higher than you expected—nearly ten feet up, on a sturdy branch where she can brace her back against the trunk. Her velvet dress is ruined, smeared with moss and bark. Her ribbons have come completely undone, dark hair tumbling around her shoulders.\n\n\nShe is not looking at the view. She is looking at her own hands—scraped, dirty, a small scratch on one palm where the bark bit her.\n\n\n\"I did it myself,\" she says quietly. There is wonder in her voice. \"Gonzalito helped but I climbed. With my own hands.\"\n\n\nInés remains on the lowest branch, content with her achievement. She has discovered a line of ants marching along the bark and is watching them with rapt attention, her earlier fear entirely forgotten.\n\n\n\nOn the Ground\n\n\nLucía has not approached the tree. She sits cross-legged in the moss among the roots, her blue cloak spread around her, utterly absorbed in something on the ground. When you glance her way, you see that she has found a flat piece of bark and is scratching at it with a sharp stone—drawing. The shape is rough but recognizable: a tree, with small figures climbing it.\n\n\nShe looks up, sees you watching, and hunches her shoulders as if expecting to be scolded. But she does not stop drawing.\n\n\nFernando has been corralled by his nurse and is now sitting in the grass nearby, playing with a collection of pinecones someone has gathered for him. He seems entirely content. Occasionally he tries to eat one.\n\n\nThe infants—Bianca and Teresa—sleep peacefully in their covered litter, oblivious to the revolution occurring around them.\n\n\n\nThe Adults\n\n\nSister Margarita has risen from her rock and moved closer to the tree, her prayer book still closed in her hands. She watches the children with an expression of quiet amazement.\n\n\n\"David was a shepherd boy before he was a king,\" she murmurs, almost to herself. \"He must have climbed trees. It is not in Scripture, but... he must have.\"\n\n\nDoña Beatriz has wiped her tears and recovered her composure, though her eyes remain bright. She watches Catalina in the tree with something like hunger—the hunger of a woman who has spent years trying to do right by a child and has only just realized she may have been doing it wrong.\n\n\nMartín de Valdés catches your eye and tips his head toward the stream. The message is clear: whenever you are ready, the next lesson awaits. Snares. Tracking. The business of providing for oneself in the wild.\n\n\nBut for now, there are four children in a tree, one child drawing in the dirt, and a two-year-old waging war against a pinecone.\n\n\nAnd somewhere above you, your daughter laughs again—that wild, surprised, delighted sound—as Gonzalito shows her how to spot a bird's nest hidden in the upper branches."

The children should respond to his question.\n\nLet me have the children respond eagerly, with Gonzalito being the one who spotted the water earlier.\n\n\nThe Oak Tree\n\n\nGonzalito's face lights up with pride. He points emphatically through the leaves, arm outstretched like a general directing troops.\n\n\n\"That way! I saw it! There's a shallow part with rocks—you can see the water shining through the trees!\" He is already beginning his descent, scrambling down with reckless confidence. \"I can lead! I know exactly where it is!\"\n\n\nPedro follows more carefully, but his voice carries the same excitement. \"I saw it too! Knights always find water for their men.

She is thinking, not performing. \"Is that how explorers find water? By looking for the bright places?\"\n\n\nInés has not heard the question. She is conducting a careful negotiation with a beetle that has crawled onto her hand, trying to convince it not to fly away.\n\n\nOn the ground, Lucía looks up from her bark-drawing.

She does not volunteer to lead—that is not her nature—but she quietly tucks her drawing-bark into her cloak and stands, ready to follow.\n\n\nGonzalito hits the ground with a soft thump and immediately turns to help Pedro with the last few feet.

Her fingers grip the branch tighter.\n\n\nThen she sets her jaw—that stubborn Trastámara expression you know well from your own mirror—and begins to lower herself. Her movements are slow, careful, nothing like Gonzalito's effortless scrambling. Twice her foot slips and she freezes, clinging to the bark.\n\n\n\"You're doing good,\" Pedro calls from below, having appointed himself as encouragement. \"Knights fall sometimes.

Her dress is beyond saving—torn at the hem, smeared green and brown. Her hands are red and scraped.\n\n\nShe looks at her palms again, then up at the tree she has just conquered, and a small, private smile crosses her face.\n\n\nInés presents a different challenge. She has not moved from her lowest branch, and now that it is time to descend, she has remembered how high up she is. Her thumb is firmly in her mouth. Her other hand grips the branch with white-knuckled terror.\n\n\n\"I stuck,\" she announces, her voice quavering. \"Mama. Mama. I stuck.\"\n\n\nMaría starts forward, but Catalina—dirty, disheveled Catalina—moves faster.\n\n\n\"You're not stuck,\" the princess says, looking up at the smaller girl. \"You climbed up.

Gonzalito, still in the tree, puts a steadying hand on her back.\n\n\n\"I'll count,\" he says. \"One... two...\"\n\n\nOn three, Inés lets go.\n\n\nShe falls perhaps two feet before Catalina catches her—awkwardly, both girls stumbling, nearly toppling into the moss together. But they do not fall. Catalina steadies them both, her arms wrapped around the smaller girl.\n\n\nFor a moment they stand there, breathing hard, tangled together.\n\n\nThen Inés giggles. And Catalina giggles. And suddenly both girls are laughing—the helpless, silly laughter of children who have done something frightening and survived.\n\n\nLucía watches this with wide eyes, her drawing-bark clutched to her chest. Something shifts in her expression—a door opening, perhaps, that she did not know was closed.\n\n\nFernando has abandoned his pinecones and is now trying to catch Lucía's attention by waving a fistful of grass at her.\n\n\nThe party is assembled: four tree-climbers flushed with triumph, one artist with bark-dust on her fingers, one determined toddler, and two sleeping infants in their litter.\n\n\nMartín de Valdés moves to the front of the group, ready to let the children lead but prepared to guide them if they stray too far.\n\n\nGonzalito bounces on his heels, pointing toward the tree line. \"This way!

Through here!\" Gonzalito calls, ducking under a low branch.\n\n\nThe path he has chosen is not a path at all—it is a deer trail, narrow and winding, threading between oaks and wild olive trees. The adults have to duck and twist to follow where the children pass easily.\n\n\nCatalina walks with purpose, her ruined dress catching on brambles. She does not complain. Twice she holds branches back so that Inés, toddling behind her, can pass without being scratched. The smaller girl has attached herself to the princess like a shadow, one hand clutching the hem of Catalina's red cloak.\n\n\nLucía drifts at the edges of the group, her eyes on everything except the path ahead.

In the silence, beneath the rustle of leaves and the distant call of birds, there is another sound—the soft, musical chatter of running water.\n\n\nGonzalito grins triumphantly. \"Told you!\"\n\n\nHe pushes through a screen of willow branches, and then—\n\n\nThe Stream\n\n\nIt is perfect.\n\n\nThe water runs clear and cold over a bed of smooth stones, perhaps ten feet wide at this point. To the left, it deepens into a pool shaded by overhanging branches. To the right, it spreads into the shallow, sun-dappled stretch that Gonzalito spotted from the tree—barely ankle-deep, with flat rocks breaking the surface like stepping stones.\n\n\nDragonflies dart above the water. Minnows flash silver in the shallows. The banks are soft with moss and fern.\n\n\nGonzalito turns to face the group, arms spread wide, practically glowing with pride. \"I found it! I led us here!\"\n\n\n\"We found it,\" Pedro corrects, but he is grinning too.\n\n\nInés has released Catalina's cloak and is already crouching at the water's edge, peering at something beneath the surface. \"Fishies,\" she breathes. \"Little tiny fishies.\"\n\n\nLucía moves to a sun-warmed rock and sits, pulling out her drawing-bark. Her eyes move across the scene—water, willows, children, light—already composing.\n\n\nCatalina stands at the edge of the stream, looking down at her reflection in the still water of the pool. A wild-haired girl in a torn dress stares back at her. She tilts her head, studying this strange version of herself.\n\n\nSister Margarita has found a seat on a fallen log. She watches the children with a soft expression. \"And Moses struck the rock, and water came forth,\" she murmurs. \"Though I think Gonzalito's method was rather easier.\"\n\n\nMartín de Valdés crouches upstream, examining the mud of the bank.

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated children's reactions while respecting narrative constraints.\n\nThe user is gathering the children and asking about drinking from the stream, catching fish, and playing in mud. I need to show the children's reactions to these questions, particularly the question about playing in mud - which Catalina earlier admitted she liked doing.\n\nRemember: I must NOT generate dialogue or actions for Juan. I should stop when Juan would need to speak or act.\n\nLet me show Sister Margarita's response and then the children's reactions to Juan's questions about mud and fish.\n\n\nThe Stream\n\n\nSister Margarita's eyes brighten at your words. She sits up straighter on her fallen log, her prayer book momentarily forgotten.\n\n\n\"The wilderness,\" she repeats, half to herself. \"Yes... there is much Scripture in the wilderness. Moses and the Israelites wandering for forty years. Elijah fed by ravens at the brook Cherith. John the Baptist living on locusts and wild honey...\" She trails off, her gaze growing distant, already composing. \"David as a shepherd boy, perhaps. Before he was king. Protecting his flock from lions and bears with nothing but faith and a sling.\"\n\n\nShe looks at the children scattered along the stream bank—dirty, bright-eyed, more alive than she has ever seen them.\n\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. I will have a story for the fire tonight.\"\n\n\n\nThe Children\n\n\nAt the word \"explorers,\" heads turn. Gonzalito and Pedro snap to attention like soldiers. Inés looks up from her minnows. Even Lucía pauses her drawing.\n\n\nThey gather before you in a ragged semicircle, stream water already darkening the hems of cloaks and the toes of shoes. Fernando squirms in the servant's arms, reaching toward the water with grasping hands.\n\n\nGonzalito nods vigorously at the mention of drinking. \"Father says you should always drink upstream from where animals cross. The water is cleaner.\" He points toward where the stream emerges from between two mossy boulders. \"There. That looks good.\"\n\n\nPedro is already focused on the second task. \"Catch fish? With our hands?\" His eyes widen with excitement rather than doubt. \"Can we really? How do we—do we just grab them?\"\n\n\nMartín de Valdés, standing nearby, suppresses a smile. He knows how difficult it is to catch fish by hand. He also knows how much children learn from trying.\n\n\nBut it is the last question that causes the real stir.\n\n\nIs there someone who is good at playing in the mud?\n\n\nA silence falls. The children exchange glances. Playing in mud is forbidden. Everyone knows this. Nurses scold. Mothers despair. Mud ruins clothes and tracks across clean floors and is not for children of quality.\n\n\nAnd yet the king has asked.\n\n\nInés looks at her mother, confusion written on her small face. María gives a helpless shrug—she has no guidance for this situation.\n\n\nLucía's fingers tighten on her drawing-bark. She knows mud. She has made things with it in secret, behind the laundry where no one watches. But she cannot admit this. Can she?\n\n\nGonzalito shifts his weight. He has opinions about mud—strong opinions—but something holds him back from speaking first.\n\n\nPedro frowns, genuinely puzzled. Knights do not play in mud. Mud is an obstacle to be marched through, not played with.\n\n\nAnd then there is Catalina.\n\n\nShe stands very still, her grey eyes fixed on you. Her hands—already dirty, already scraped from climbing—curl slowly at her sides. The memory hangs between you, unspoken: I like mud. Making things out of mud. But Doña Beatriz says princesses don't play in mud.\n\n\nYou told her there would be mud. You promised.\n\n\nHer chin lifts. That Trastámara stubbornness. That quiet defiance she has inherited from ancestors who carved a kingdom out of war and wilderness.\n\n\n\"I am,\" she says. Her voice is small but clear. \"I am good at playing in mud. I make things. Castles and... and animals. When no one is watching.\"\n\n\nShe glances at Doña Beatriz—a flicker of old fear—but the old woman's face shows nothing but gentle encouragement.\n\n\nCatalina looks back at you, waiting to see if the world will punish her for this confession, or if the rules have truly changed."

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated children's joyful liberation through mud and fish-catching chaos.\n\nThe user is playing as King Juan II and has just encouraged the children to play in the mud and catch fish. He's said \"Attack!\" to encourage them to go after the fish and play in the mud.\n\nI need to describe how the children react to this permission - this is a pivotal moment where the rigid social rules are breaking down. I should show each child's reaction and how they engage with this newfound freedom, but I must NOT generate any dialogue or actions for Juan. I should stop at natural points where Juan might want to respond or act.\n\nLet me describe the chaos and joy that ensues when royal permission is given for mud-playing and fish-catching.\n\n\nThe Stream\n\n\nThe word \"attack\" acts like a spell breaking.\n\n\nGonzalito is first into the water, boots and all, splashing toward where you pointed. \"I see it! I see it!\" He lunges, hands plunging beneath the surface, and comes up empty, water streaming down his sleeves. He does not care. He is already hunting for the next flash of silver.\n\n\nPedro charges in beside him, stick-sword finally abandoned on the bank. \"Flank it! Flank it!\" he bellows, applying military tactics to fish-catching. \"You go left, I'll go right!\" The two boys crash through the shallows together, more noise than strategy, sending minnows scattering in every direction.\n\n\nInés does not chase fish. She goes straight for the mud—the soft, silty bank where the stream curves and deposits its dark treasure. She plunges both hands in up to her wrists and squeals with pure, unrestrained joy. \"Squishy! Mama, it's squishy!\"\n\n\nMaría, her mother, opens her mouth—to scold, to forbid, to do what mothers do—and then closes it again. Her daughter is elbow-deep in mud, giggling helplessly, and the king himself gave permission. She presses a hand over her eyes and laughs, the desperate laugh of a woman surrendering to chaos.\n\n\nLucía approaches the mud more carefully, kneeling at the edge. She watches Inés for a moment, then reaches out with one tentative finger. She pokes the surface. Draws a line. Then another. Within moments she is sculpting—not playing, but creating—her small hands shaping the dark earth into something only she can see.\n\n\nFernando has finally escaped his nurse's grasp. He toddles toward the water with the determined gait of a toddler on a mission, arms outstretched for balance. Before anyone can catch him, he sits down heavily in the shallows—and discovers, with evident delight, that water is wet. He slaps the surface with both palms, showering himself and cackling.\n\n\nThe nurse looks to Doña Beatriz in horror. Doña Beatriz shakes her head slowly. Let him.\n\n\nAnd Catalina—\n\n\nCatalina walks to the muddy bank and kneels beside Inés. For a moment she simply looks at the dark earth, breathing slowly. This is it. The forbidden thing. The secret pleasure she has only ever indulged in hidden corners.\n\n\nShe places her hands flat on the mud. Feels it ooze between her fingers. Cool. Heavy. Alive with possibility.\n\n\nAnd then Princess Catalina of Trastámara, daughter of kings, begins to build.\n\n\n\"A castle,\" she murmurs, half to herself, half to Inés beside her. \"With towers. And a moat—we can bring water from the stream for the moat. And walls, thick walls, like Toledo has...\"\n\n\nInés nods eagerly, understanding none of this but thrilled to be included. \"I help! I get water!\" She cups her muddy hands and runs to the stream, losing most of her cargo on the way back, then runs again.\n\n\nLucía shifts closer, watching Catalina's hands. \"How do you make the towers stand up?\" she asks—the first words she has spoken voluntarily all day.\n\n\nCatalina shows her. \"You have to pack it tight. And make the bottom wider than the top. Otherwise it falls.\"\n\n\n\nThe Fish\n\n\nGonzalito and Pedro have developed a system—or what they believe is a system. It involves much splashing, shouting of contradictory orders, and occasional accusations of sabotage.\n\n\n\"You scared it away!\"\n\n\n\"You scared it away!\"\n\n\n\"There! THERE! Get it!\"\n\n\nMore splashing. More failure. But also—more laughter than has been heard from either boy in weeks.\n\n\nMartín de Valdés wades quietly into the stream upstream of the chaos. He stands very still, water swirling around his calves, watching. His hands hover just below the surface.\n\n\nHe does not speak. He does not instruct. He simply waits.\n\n\nThe boys do not notice. They are too busy inventing increasingly elaborate strategies that involve corralling fish into corners that do not exist.\n\n\n\nThe Adults\n\n\nSister Margarita has moved to a rock closer to the mud-workers, watching Catalina's castle take shape. \"The Israelites made bricks from mud and straw,\" she observes quietly. \"To build the Pharaoh's cities. But your castle, I think, is built for better purposes.\"\n\n\nCatalina looks up, startled to be addressed by the nun without a lesson attached. Sister Margarita only smiles and gestures for her to continue.\n\n\nDoña Beatriz stands beside Lucia—your Lucia, the queen who did not come on this expedition but whose vision helped shape it. No—that is wrong. Lucia is not here. Doña Beatriz stands alone, watching your daughter build castles in the mud, tears streaming freely down her face now.\n\n\n\"I kept her in a cage,\" she whispers, though no one is close enough to hear. \"A gilded cage, but a cage. God forgive me.\"\n\n\n\nThe afternoon sun slants golden through the willows. The stream runs on, patient and eternal. The children are soaked, muddy, exhausted, and incandescently happy.\n\n\nFernando has discovered that mud also exists, and is now attempting to eat it. The nurse has given up on cleanliness and is merely trying to prevent consumption of the landscape.\n\n\nAnd from upstream, very quietly, Martín de Valdés lifts his hands from the water. Cupped between them, flashing silver and struggling weakly, is a small trout.\n\n\nHe catches your eye and waits."

I should describe the scene and stop at natural decision points or when NPCs address Juan directly.\n\n\nThe Stream\n\n\nThe boys freeze mid-splash at your applause. They turn, water dripping from their sleeves, and see Martín de Valdés standing still as a heron with a gleaming trout cupped in his weathered hands.\n\n\nGonzalito's jaw drops. \"How—he didn't even move!\"\n\n\nPedro wades closer, eyes wide with awe. \"It's huge.\" The fish is not huge—perhaps the length of a man's hand—but to a five-year-old who has spent the last hour failing to catch minnows, it might as well be a whale.\n\n\nMartín allows the boys to look, turning his hands so they can see the trout's spotted flanks, the desperate flex of its tail, the gills working frantically.\n\n\n\"Patience,\" the huntsman says simply. \"Fish are curious. Stand still long enough, and they come to see what you are. Then—\" He mimes a quick, scooping motion. \"You must be faster than they are. But only at the last moment.\"\n\n\nGonzalito and Pedro exchange glances—a wordless pact. They will learn this secret. They will catch fish with their bare hands. Perhaps not today. But soon.\n\n\nMartín produces a leather cord from his belt and threads it through the trout's gill, securing their first catch of the expedition. \"One fish feeds no one,\" he says. \"But it is a beginning. Tomorrow, perhaps, we catch more.\"\n\n\n\nThe Return\n\n\nGathering the children takes longer than expected.\n\n\nCatalina's mud castle has grown into a sprawling fortification, complete with walls, towers, and a moat that Inés has filled and refilled a dozen times. The princess stands over her creation with the satisfaction of a master builder, reluctant to leave it.\n\n\n\"The rain will wash it away,\" she says quietly, a note of mourning in her voice.\n\n\nSister Margarita, passing nearby, pauses. \"All earthly kingdoms wash away, child. But the building of them—that stays with us.\"\n\n\nCatalina considers this. Nods slowly. And turns away from her castle without looking back.\n\n\nLucía has to be coaxed from her mud-sculpture—a surprisingly detailed bird, wings half-spread, emerging from the bank as if taking flight. Her mother gasps when she sees it.\n\n\n\"Mija, that is... how did you...?\"\n\n\nLucía only shrugs, embarrassed by the attention, and wipes her hands on her already-ruined cloak.\n\n\nInés is a creature of pure mud, barely recognizable as human. She has to be carried back by her father, Rodrigo, who holds her at arm's length and laughs despite himself. \"You are more pig than girl, little one.\"\n\n\n\"Piggies are nice,\" Inés mumbles sleepily, thumb in mouth. \"'Nimals.\"\n\n\nFernando is similarly transformed, though in his case it is less mud and more a general coating of stream water, silt, and what appears to be partially chewed vegetation. His nurse carries him with the grim determination of a soldier bearing a wounded comrade from battle.\n\n\nPedro and Gonzalito bring up the rear, still talking excitedly about fish-catching techniques, their earlier rivalry forgotten in shared purpose.\n\n\n\nThe Camp\n\n\nThe servants have been busy in your absence.\n\n\nThree tents stand in a loose circle around a cleared space where a fire pit has been dug and ringed with stones. The pack mules are picketed nearby, contentedly cropping grass. A rough table of planks laid across stumps holds provisions—bread, cheese, dried sausage, apples, a skin of wine for the adults, watered wine for the older children, fresh water from the stream for the little ones.\n\n\nThe sun is sinking toward the western hills, painting the sky in shades of amber and rose. The air is cooling, carrying the scent of pine and wood smoke.\n\n\nThe children are cleaned—after a fashion. Stream water removes the worst of the mud, though Inés's hair may never be the same. Dry clothes are produced from the packs, simple garments without the elaborate fastenings of court dress. The expedition cloaks are hung to dry near the fire, stiff with mud and water but somehow more precious for it.\n\n\n\nThe Fire\n\n\nAs darkness gathers, the camp draws inward toward the flames.\n\n\nThe children sit in a rough semicircle, wrapped in blankets, bellies full of bread and cheese and the small trout that Martín roasted over the coals—each child receiving a single bite of the shared catch, a sacrament of their first successful hunt.\n\n\nCatalina sits between Lucía and Inés, the three girls pressed close together for warmth. The barriers of rank have not vanished—they are too deeply ingrained for that—but they have... thinned. Something has shifted.\n\n\nGonzalito and Pedro sit together, shoulder to shoulder, already whispering plans for tomorrow's fish-catching.\n\n\nFernando is asleep in Doña Beatriz's lap, exhausted beyond the capacity of any two-year-old to resist.\n\n\nThe infants slumber in their tent, watched over by the wet nurses.\n\n\nThe fire crackles. Sparks rise toward the stars, which are emerging now in the darkening sky—more stars than can be seen from Toledo, where smoke and torchlight dim the heavens.\n\n\nSister Margarita moves to a seat near the fire, her face lit by the dancing flames. The children's eyes turn toward her, expectant.\n\n\nShe has had the afternoon to compose her tale. She looks around the circle—at the dirty, tired, happy faces watching her—and begins.\n\n\n\"Long ago, in a land of hills and sheep and wild places, there lived a boy named David. He was the youngest of eight brothers, and because he was youngest, he was given the task that no one else wanted: tending his father's sheep in the wilderness, far from home, with only his faith and his courage for company...\"\n\n\n\nThe story unfolds in the firelight.\n\n\nDavid alone in the hills. The lion that came for his flock—Sister Margarita's voice drops low, and Inés clutches Catalina's arm. The boy who faced it with nothing but a sling and the conviction that God stood with him. The bear that followed. Each victory a preparation for a battle he did not yet know was coming.\n\n\n\"And so David learned,\" Sister Margarita says, her eyes moving from face to face, \"that the wilderness was not a punishment but a gift. That God sends us into hard places not to break us, but to make us ready. The lion taught David courage. The bear taught him that courage could be called upon again. And when he stood before the giant Goliath, with all the armies of Israel trembling behind him, David was not afraid. Because he had already learned, in the wild places, that he was never truly alone.\"\n\n\nShe pauses. The fire pops. An owl calls somewhere in the darkness.\n\n\n\"Tomorrow, you will learn to set snares. To read tracks. To catch fish with patience instead of splashing.\" A smile touches her weathered face. \"These are small lessons. But small lessons prepare us for great trials. Just as David's sheep prepared him for Goliath. Just as your mud castles and your tree-climbing and your courage today prepare you for... whatever God has planned for you.\"\n\n\nHer eyes find Catalina's.\n\n\n\"Even princesses need wilderness. Perhaps especially princesses.\"\n\n\n\nThe fire burns low. The children's eyes are heavy. One by one, they are carried or guided to their tents—boys in one, girls in another, the adults distributed among the third and around the fire to keep watch.\n\n\nCatalina pauses at the entrance to the girls' tent. She looks back at you, her face unreadable in the dim light.\n\n\n\"Papa?\"\n\n\nShe hesitates. The word she wants seems to stick in her throat.\n\n\n\"Thank you,\" she says finally. \"For the mud.\"\n\n\nThen she disappears into the tent, and you hear Inés's sleepy voice asking if they can build another castle tomorrow, and Lucía quietly saying she wants to draw it first, and Catalina—your Catalina—saying yes, yes, they can do both."

This is a chaos roll to determine how the remaining days go - the activities include drawing, playing knights with wooden swords, tree climbing (with Gonzalito as the safety expert), and going with the huntsman to set snares and collect catches.\n\nI should consider:\n- The children's ages and abilities\n- The activities planned (drawing, sword play, climbing, snare-setting, hunting)\n- Potential risks (injuries, getting lost, animal encounters)\n- Potential benefits (bonding, learning, character development)\n- The goal of the trip: to break down barriers between the children, give them freedom, teach them skills, and let them be children\n\nFactors favoring success:\n- Children are already engaged and excited from day one\n- Barriers between children already thinning\n- Martín de Valdés is an experienced huntsman and teacher\n- Adults are present but not smothering\n- Sister Margarita has found her voice as a storyteller\n- Gonzalito is a natural climber and can help others\n- The activities match the children's interests (as established earlier)\n- Good weather (presumably)\n- Adequate supplies and backup food\n\nFactors against:\n- Children are young (ages 2-6 for the playmates, plus infants)\n- Wooden sword play can lead to injuries\n- Tree climbing has inherent risks\n- Wild animals could be encountered\n- Weather could turn\n- Illness could strike\n- Children could wander off\n- Snares involve sharp wire/cord and dead animals\n- Personality conflicts could emerge\n- Homesickness might set in\n\nI'll create a table that reflects these factors, with outcomes ranging from disaster to transformative success.\n\n\nThe Expedition Continues\n\n\nThe first day has exceeded all expectations. But there are still three or four days ahead—days of drawing and sword-fighting and climbing and snare-setting. Days for bonds to deepen or fray, for lessons to take root or wither, for the fragile magic of this expedition to solidify into something lasting or dissolve into memory.\n\n\n\nChaos Roll: The Remainder of the Camping Trip\n\n\nPlanned Activities:\n\n\nDrawing for all children (with proper materials now distributed)\n\nWooden sword practice and knight-play\n\nTree climbing with Gonzalito as safety guide, adults nearby\n\nSnare-setting with Martín de Valdés\n\nChecking snares and collecting catches\n\nCampfire stories each evening\n\nGeneral exploration and play\n\n\nFactors Favoring Success:\n\n\nExceptional first day—barriers already thinning between children\n\nChildren matched to activities they enjoy (established interests)\n\nGonzalito is a natural climber and teacher; giving him responsibility builds confidence\n\nMartín de Valdés is patient and skilled at teaching\n\nSister Margarita has found her voice as a storyteller\n\nAdults present but not smothering—correct balance established\n\nAdequate supplies and backup food if hunting fails\n\nChildren are engaged, excited, and forming genuine connections\n\nCatalina's transformation already visible—a leader emerging\n\nWeather appears fair (autumn in Castile, typically dry)\n\n\nFactors Against:\n\n\nYoung children (ages 2-6) tire easily and can become fractious\n\nWooden sword play carries risk of bumps, bruises, or worse\n\nTree climbing always carries injury risk, despite precautions\n\nSnares involve dead animals—could upset sensitive children\n\nWild animals could be encountered (boar, wolves in these hills)\n\nWeather could turn suddenly (autumn storms)\n\nMinor illness could spread quickly in close quarters\n\nPersonality conflicts may emerge as novelty wears off\n\nHomesickness might strike younger children\n\nFernando (age 2) requires constant supervision\n\nInfants add complexity and limit mobility\n\n\n\nd100 Table:\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-3\nSerious Accident: Something goes badly wrong. A fall from a tree results in a broken bone—perhaps Gonzalito, pushing too high to impress the others, or one of the younger children attempting something beyond their skill. Or wooden sword play turns rough and someone is genuinely hurt. Or a snare injures a curious hand. The expedition must return early. The injured child recovers, but the incident casts a shadow over the enterprise. Parents' fears are confirmed. Recriminations follow.\n4-8\nIllness Strikes: A fever spreads through the children—perhaps from the stream water, perhaps simply the close quarters and exertion. One or more children become genuinely sick, requiring the expedition to cut short and return. No lasting harm, but the abrupt ending sours the experience. The children remember being sick more than they remember the joy.\n9-14\nWeather Disaster: Autumn storms sweep in without warning. The camp is battered by wind and rain. Tents collapse or leak. Everyone is cold, wet, and miserable for a day or more. The expedition survives, but the final days are spent in damage control rather than adventure. The children are resilient, but the magic is dampened.\n15-22\nConflicts Emerge: As the novelty fades, personality conflicts surface. Perhaps Pedro and Gonzalito's rivalry reasserts itself. Perhaps one child feels excluded or bullied. Perhaps the social divisions—royal and common—prove harder to bridge than hoped. The adults must intervene. The expedition continues, but the easy camaraderie of the first day proves difficult to sustain. Progress, but incomplete.\n23-32\nMixed Results: Some activities succeed beautifully; others disappoint. Perhaps the snares catch nothing, leaving the children frustrated. Perhaps the climbing lessons go well but the sword-play becomes too rough. Perhaps Catalina retreats into formality when tired or stressed. The trip is worthwhile—better than the stifling household—but falls short of transformation. A foundation, not a triumph.\n33-45\nSolid Success: The expedition accomplishes its goals. The children learn, play, and bond. Snares catch rabbits; the children help clean and cook them. Sword-fighting is rowdy but no one is hurt beyond bruises. Climbing continues safely under Gonzalito's surprisingly responsible guidance. The social barriers remain thin but do not vanish entirely. The children return tired, dirty, and noticeably happier. The household will need continued attention, but the trip has proven the concept.\n46-60\nGood Success: Better than expected. The children form genuine friendships that transcend rank. Gonzalito takes his responsibility seriously and grows visibly in confidence. Pedro's martial enthusiasm finds appropriate outlet. Lucía emerges from her shell, sharing her drawings with the group. Inés becomes the expedition's mascot, her delight in animals infectious. Catalina leads naturally, without arrogance. Sister Margarita's nightly stories become treasured rituals. The hunting yields enough to feed the camp twice. The return to Casa de las Palomas feels like coming home, not returning to a cage.\n61-74\nVery Good Success: The expedition exceeds hopes. Something clicks among the children—a bond that feels genuine and lasting. They develop their own games, their own jokes, their own small traditions. Gonzalito teaches everyone to climb; Pedro teaches them to fence (with appropriate supervision). Lucía's drawings become a shared project—she sketches, others color with charcoal and berry-juice. Catalina tells stories of her own, improvised tales that blend Sister Margarita's biblical themes with her own imagination. The adults step back, marveling. Martín de Valdés pronounces the older children \"natural hunters.\"\n75-85\nExcellent Success: Transformative for multiple children. Catalina emerges as a natural leader—not imperious but genuinely caring, helping younger children, mediating disputes, sharing credit. Gonzalito's confidence blooms into something approaching self-possession. Pedro learns patience from the snares, discovering that not all victories come from charging. Lucía shares her art freely for the first time in her life, and the praise she receives visibly changes her. Even tiny Inés contributes—her eye for animal tracks proves surprisingly sharp. The group returns not as princess-and-companions but as friends. The adults speak of this trip for years afterward.\n86-93\nOutstanding Success: The expedition becomes something legendary in the small world of the household. Every activity succeeds beyond expectation. The snares yield abundant catches; the children clean and cook their own meals with pride. A genuine adventure occurs—perhaps tracking a deer for miles, or discovering a hidden cave, or encountering a fox family that Inés befriends from a distance. Sister Margarita's stories interweave with the children's experiences until faith and adventure become inseparable in their minds. Catalina's walls come down completely; she is happy, truly happy, perhaps for the first time since her mother died. The other children see the princess as a friend, not a figure of awe. Bonds are forged that will last lifetimes.\n94-97\nExceptional Achievement: Something unexpected and wonderful occurs. Perhaps one of the children displays a remarkable gift—Lucía's art catches Martín de Valdés's attention and he recognizes genuine talent worth cultivating. Perhaps Catalina and Gonzalito together solve a real problem—a lost path, a stuck animal, a genuine small crisis—and discover they work brilliantly as a team. Perhaps the group encounters someone in the wilderness—a hermit, a lost traveler, a shepherd—and the children's compassion and courage shine. The expedition becomes a story the children will tell their own children someday.\n98-100\nBlessed Event: Everything aligns in ways that seem touched by providence. The weather is perfect. The hunting is abundant. The children's bonds deepen into something that will shape their entire lives. An unexpected discovery—perhaps an ancient ruin, a rare animal, a natural wonder—creates a shared memory of awe. Catalina experiences something approaching joy—real, uncomplicated joy—that cracks open her careful heart. And in a quiet moment, perhaps around the fire on the last night, something is said or done that crystallizes the meaning of it all: that wilderness teaches what palaces cannot, that freedom is not the absence of protection but the presence of trust, that these children—royal and common alike—are being prepared for something greater than they know. You return to Casa de las Palomas with a household transformed, ready to become the home you envisioned.\n\n\nNote on Injuries:\nMinor scrapes, bruises, and bumps are expected and occur regardless of roll. The \"Serious Accident\" result (1-3) indicates something requiring medical attention and early return.\n\n\nNote on Weather:\nRolls 9-14 indicate significant weather problems. Light rain or brief storms may occur on other results but do not significantly impact the expedition.\n\n\n\nPlease roll d100."

Let me describe how the remainder of the camping trip unfolds according to this result.\n\n\"Good Success: Better than expected. The children form genuine friendships that transcend rank. Gonzalito takes his responsibility seriously and grows visibly in confidence. Pedro's martial enthusiasm finds appropriate outlet. Lucía emerges from her shell, sharing her drawings with the group. Inés becomes the expedition's mascot, her delight in animals infectious. Catalina leads naturally, without arrogance. Sister Margarita's nightly stories become treasured rituals. The hunting yields enough to feed the camp twice. The return to Casa de las Palomas feels like coming home, not returning to a cage.\"\n\nI should narrate the remaining days of the expedition, showing these developments. I need to be careful not to generate dialogue or actions for Juan - I should stop when Juan would need to act or speak.\n\n\nRoll 51: Good Success\n\n\n\nDay Two: The Drawing\n\n\nThe morning begins slowly. Tired muscles protest. Inés wakes crying, disoriented by the unfamiliar tent. Fernando, predictably, has somehow removed all his clothing during the night and is discovered attempting to escape into the dawn mist.\n\n\nBut breakfast—bread toasted over the rekindled fire, apples, cheese—restores spirits. And when the drawing materials are distributed, a hush falls over the camp.\n\n\nLucia—your Lucia—had sent paper and charcoal for everyone, as you requested. Good paper, smooth and cream-colored. Sticks of willow charcoal, soft and forgiving. The children gather in a sunny clearing, cloaks spread beneath them, and set to work.\n\n\nLucía is in her element. For the first time since the expedition began, she is not hovering at the edges. She sits at the center of the group, her hands moving with quiet confidence, and the other children watch her with something approaching awe.\n\n\n\"How do you make it look real?\" Gonzalito asks, peering at her sketch of yesterday's oak tree.\n\n\nLucía hesitates—she is not accustomed to being asked her opinion—but something in Gonzalito's genuine curiosity draws her out.\n\n\n\"You have to look,\" she says softly. \"Really look. Not at the whole tree. At one branch. At how the bark wrinkles. At where the shadow falls.\" She demonstrates, adding texture to the trunk with quick, light strokes. \"Then you do the next part. And the next. And eventually... it's a tree.\"\n\n\nPedro attacks his paper with the same martial enthusiasm he brings to everything. His drawing is... energetic. A knight on horseback, sword raised, enemies falling before him. The proportions are wildly wrong—the horse has legs like tree trunks, the knight's head is enormous—but the energy is undeniable.\n\n\n\"That's you?\" Catalina asks, looking over his shoulder.\n\n\n\"That's me when I'm grown,\" Pedro says firmly. \"After I'm knighted. Fighting the Moors. Or maybe dragons.\"\n\n\n\"There aren't any dragons,\" Gonzalito points out.\n\n\n\"There might be. Somewhere.\"\n\n\nGonzalito draws maps. Not pictures—maps. The stream, the camp, the oak tree, the path between them. He marks distances with small notations, adds arrows for direction.\n\n\n\"If we get lost,\" he explains seriously, \"we can find our way back.\"\n\n\nInés draws animals. Or attempts to. Her rabbits look like clouds with ears. Her fish are simply circles with tails. But she narrates each one with elaborate stories—this rabbit is friends with that rabbit, this fish is looking for its mother—until her paper becomes less a drawing and more a world.\n\n\nCatalina draws slowly, deliberately. She does not show her work to the others. When the session ends and the children scatter to other activities, she folds her paper carefully and tucks it inside her cloak.\n\n\nLater—much later, after the expedition has ended—Doña Beatriz will find that paper among Catalina's things. It shows a family: a tall figure in a crown, a woman beside him, and four children of varying sizes. They are holding hands. Behind them, sketched in uncertain lines, is a tree.\n\n\n\nDay Two: The Swords\n\n\nWooden swords have been carved by one of the servants—simple things, flat and blunt, sized for small hands. When they are distributed after the midday meal, chaos threatens.\n\n\nPedro snatches his immediately, assuming a fighting stance. \"I challenge everyone! All at once!\"\n\n\n\"That's not how it works,\" Gonzalito protests. \"You have to have rules. You can't just—\"\n\n\nBut Pedro is already swinging.\n\n\nThe first hour is pandemonium. Pedro batters everyone within reach. Gonzalito retreats to a tree (naturally) and refuses to come down. Inés bursts into tears when a wild swing catches her shoulder. Lucía hides behind her mother.\n\n\nIt is Catalina who restores order.\n\n\n\"Stop.\"\n\n\nHer voice is not loud, but it carries. Perhaps it is the same quality that makes her singing extraordinary—a clarity that cuts through noise.\n\n\nPedro freezes mid-swing. Everyone turns.\n\n\nCatalina stands with her wooden sword held at her side, her grey eyes fixed on Pedro with an expression that is pure Trastámara: imperious, unimpressed, and utterly certain of her authority.\n\n\n\"Knights have rules,\" she says. \"My papa told me. They don't just hit people. They bow first. They fight one at a time. And they never, ever hit someone who isn't ready.\"\n\n\nA pause. Pedro's sword droops.\n\n\n\"You're not a knight yet,\" Catalina continues, her voice softening slightly. \"You're learning. We're all learning. So we need rules, like Gonzalito said.\"\n\n\nShe looks around the group—at Inés sniffling, at Lucía hiding, at Gonzalito peering down from his branch.\n\n\n\"We take turns. We bow before we fight. We only hit the sword, not the person. And if someone says 'yield,' we stop.\" She raises her own sword, holding it before her like she has seen knights do in ceremonies. \"Those are the rules. Does everyone agree?\"\n\n\nOne by one, they nod. Even Pedro.\n\n\nThe rest of the afternoon is still rowdy—they are children, after all—but it is contained rowdiness. Catalina fights Pedro to a draw (he is stronger; she is quicker and more patient). Gonzalito descends from his tree and proves surprisingly capable once rules protect him from Pedro's berserker charges. Even Lucía takes a few tentative swings, though she clearly prefers watching to participating.\n\n\nInés appoints herself herald, announcing each bout with increasingly elaborate titles: \"Sir Pedro the Brave versus Lady Catalina the Mudcastle Builder!\"\n\n\nBy evening, they are exhausted, bruised, and united by shared combat. Something has shifted. They are not just children who happen to be in the same place. They are becoming a group.\n\n\n\nDay Three: The Snares\n\n\nMartín de Valdés leads the older children into the woods at dawn.\n\n\nGonzalito, Pedro, and Catalina follow the huntsman in single file, breath misting in the cool morning air. They have been given a sacred trust: today, they will help feed the camp.\n\n\nMartín teaches them to read the forest—the narrow paths where rabbits travel, the scratched bark where deer rub their antlers, the scattered droppings that reveal what creatures have passed.\n\n\n\"Here,\" he says, kneeling beside a gap in a thicket. \"See how the grass is worn? This is a rabbit run. They use the same paths, again and again. Creatures of habit.\"\n\n\nHe shows them how to set a simple snare—a loop of cord, disguised with leaves, positioned just so.\n\n\n\"Too high and they duck under. Too low and they step over. You must think like a rabbit.\" He looks at the children seriously. \"And you must understand what you are doing. We kill so that we may eat. It is not a game. When we take a life, we thank God for the gift and waste nothing.\"\n\n\nThe children nod solemnly.\n\n\nThey set six snares throughout the morning, marking each location with subtle signs that Martín teaches them to recognize. Then they withdraw to let the forest settle.\n\n\n\nDay Three: The Catch\n\n\nIn the late afternoon, they return to check their work.\n\n\nThe first three snares are empty. Pedro's shoulders slump with each disappointment. But Martín only nods.\n\n\n\"Patience. The forest does not owe us anything.\"\n\n\nThe fourth snare holds a rabbit—grey-brown, limp, eyes glassy. Catalina draws in a sharp breath. Gonzalito goes pale. Pedro stares with a mixture of triumph and unease.\n\n\n\"This is death,\" Martín says quietly. \"It is not pretty. But it is honest. This rabbit will feed you tonight. Its life becomes your life.\" He lifts the small body gently. \"Thank you, little one.\"\n\n\nThe fifth snare is empty. But the sixth holds another rabbit—larger, caught cleanly.\n\n\nTwo rabbits. Enough to feed the camp.\n\n\nMartín shows the older children how to clean the catch. It is bloody work, and Catalina's face is white throughout, but she does not look away. She watches every step, asking quiet questions.\n\n\n\"Why do you save the fur?\"\n\n\n\"Nothing is wasted. The fur becomes lining for gloves. The bones can make broth. Even the entrails feed other creatures.\" Martín gestures to a hawk circling overhead. \"She knows we are here. When we leave, she will take what we have left. The forest feeds itself.\"\n\n\nThat night, the children eat rabbit stew—rich and savory, cooked with wild onions Martín found near the stream. They eat in unusual silence, understanding for the first time where food comes from, what it costs, what it means.\n\n\nPedro says grace before the meal, his voice unexpectedly serious.\n\n\n\"Thank you, God, for the rabbits. And for Martín who taught us. And for...\" He hesitates. \"And for letting us learn things.\"\n\n\n\nDay Four: The Bonds\n\n\nBy the fourth day, the household has become something new.\n\n\nThe careful ranks have not disappeared—the children still know who is royal and who is not—but they have become... permeable. Catalina calls Lucía by name without thinking. Gonzalito argues with Pedro as an equal. Inés falls asleep in Catalina's lap during the afternoon rest, and no one finds this strange.\n\n\nGonzalito has grown into his role as climbing master. He takes the responsibility seriously, checking branches before letting others ascend, positioning himself to catch falls that never come. The other children respect him for it—even Pedro, who is not naturally inclined to respect anyone.\n\n\nPedro has learned, grudgingly, that patience sometimes yields better results than charging. He still prefers action, still dreams of knighthood and glory, but he can now stand still for almost a full minute while fishing. This is progress.\n\n\nLucía shares her drawings freely now. She has made a portrait of each child—quick sketches that somehow capture something essential about each of them. Pedro's shows him mid-swing, all energy and determination. Gonzalito's shows him in a tree, looking out at the world. Inés's shows her cradling an imaginary rabbit. Catalina's shows her building a mud castle, hair loose, face intent.\n\n\nWhen Lucía shyly presents these portraits, the children receive them like treasures.\n\n\nInés has become the group's conscience. Her constant commentary on animals—\"That bird is looking for its baby!\" \"Don't step on the worm, he's going home!\"—has made the other children unexpectedly gentle with the creatures they encounter. Even the hunting is conducted with greater reverence because of her.\n\n\nCatalina has found something she did not know she was missing: the freedom to be imperfect. She can lose at sword-fighting and laugh about it. She can fall in the mud and get up without shame. She can ask questions without worrying whether they are \"appropriate\" for a princess.\n\n\nOn the fourth evening, around the fire, Sister Margarita tells the story of Ruth—the foreigner who left her homeland to follow her mother-in-law into an unknown country, who gleaned grain in stranger's fields, who found belonging not through birth but through loyalty and love.\n\n\n\"Ruth was not born an Israelite,\" Sister Margarita says, her voice soft in the firelight. \"She chose to become one. She said to Naomi: 'Your people shall be my people, and your God my God.' Family is not only blood. Sometimes family is choice.\"\n\n\nThe children do not fully understand. But they feel something—the warmth of bodies pressed close, the shared exhaustion of days spent together, the knowledge that something has changed.\n\n\n\nDay Five: The Return\n\n\nThe morning of departure is subdued.\n\n\nThe children help break camp, rolling tents and gathering supplies with a competence they did not possess five days ago. The snare-lines are collected. The fire pit is buried. The clearing is returned to the forest, marked only by the faint impression of tent stakes and the scattered ash of campfires.\n\n\nCatalina stands at the edge of the clearing, looking back at the stream where she built her mud castle. The castle is long gone, washed away by rain and time. But she does not seem sad.\n\n\n\"We can come back,\" Gonzalito says, appearing beside her. \"I'll remember the way.\"\n\n\nShe nods. \"We'll come back.\"\n\n\n\nCasa de las Palomas\n\n\nThe household looks different when you return.\n\n\nNot physically—the house is unchanged, the walls still stand, the garden still grows. But the feel of it has shifted. Or perhaps it is only that you see it differently now, knowing what it could become.\n\n\nThe children tumble from the wagon, filthy and exhausted and chattering about everything they have done. Gonzalito is already explaining the route to anyone who will listen. Pedro is demonstrating sword techniques on an imaginary opponent. Lucía clutches her stack of drawings like sacred relics. Inés is telling a servant about the rabbits—how they were caught, how they were cleaned, how they tasted.\n\n\nCatalina walks more slowly, taking in the house that has been her cage for the past months. She pauses at the threshold.\n\n\n\"It's different,\" she says quietly. Not a question.\n\n\nDoña Beatriz, waiting in the doorway, kneels to meet her eyes. \"What is different, niña?\"\n\n\nCatalina considers. \"I don't know. It just... feels different.\"\n\n\nShe goes inside.\n\n\n\nAftermath\n\n\nOver the following days, the changes become visible.\n\n\nThe children seek each other out now, instead of retreating to separate corners. Pedro and Gonzalito are found playing in the garden, their old rivalry transformed into something closer to friendship. Lucía draws constantly, and the other children gather to watch and comment and suggest. Inés brings every insect and worm she finds to show the group, and they receive these offerings with appropriate solemnity.\n\n\nCatalina moves through the household with an ease she never had before. She still carries herself like a princess—that training runs too deep to vanish—but there is something lighter in her step, something more open in her face.\n\n\nShe spends time with the other children willingly, not as a duty.\n\n\nShe asks questions of Sister Margarita about David and Ruth and the wilderness.\n\n\nShe requests mud for castle-building, and Doña Beatriz, after only a moment's hesitation, orders a bucket of good clay brought to the garden.\n\n\nAnd at night, in her small bed, she falls asleep quickly and sleeps without restless dreams.\n\n\n\nDoña Beatriz's Report\n\n\nA week after the expedition, the old woman seeks an audience with you.\n\n\n\"It worked,\" she says simply. \"Not perfectly—there is still much to do. But the foundation is laid. The children are... children now. Not miniature courtiers. Not prisoners. Children.\"\n\n\nShe hesitates, then adds:\n\n\n\"The tutors have noticed the change. Fray Ambrosio asked me why the princess suddenly seems interested in Latin. I told him it is because she finally believes there is a world outside these walls worth learning about.\"\n\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\n\"Father Nikephoros has requested permission to change his teaching method. He wishes to tell stories instead of drilling grammar. He says he remembered how his grandfather taught him, and he wants to try.\"\n\n\nAnother pause.\n\n\n\"And Captain Sebastián has asked whether the guard rotation might be... adjusted. He says the children do not need soldiers hovering over them. He says they need space to grow.\"\n\n\nShe meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"You have changed something, Juan. Not just for Catalina. For all of them. For all of us.\"\n\n\nShe waits for your response."

This is a practical decision that follows from the success of the camping trip and the realization that the children need space, not constant surveillance.\n\nI should acknowledge this decision and show Doña Beatriz's reaction, and perhaps Captain Sebastián's response to these new orders. This is a significant change in how the household operates - it shows Juan's commitment to giving the children freedom while still maintaining security.\n\nI should keep this relatively brief since it's a confirmation of a decision rather than a new dramatic scene. I'll show the implementation and perhaps hint at how things will develop going forward.\n\n\nCasa de las Palomas\n\n\nDoña Beatriz nods slowly, a weight lifting from her shoulders.\n\n\n\"I will inform Captain Sebastián. He will be relieved, I think. His men are soldiers, not nursemaids—they have been as uncomfortable as the children, though they would never say so.\"\n\n\nShe moves toward the door, then pauses.\n\n\n\"There is a gatehouse cottage, just outside the wall. It was used by the previous owner's groundskeeper. Empty now, but sound. Large enough for eight men, with a clear view of the entrance.\" A small smile. \"They can be through that gate in thirty heartbeats if trouble comes. But the children will not feel their eyes on them every moment.\"\n\n\n\nThe New Arrangement\n\n\nCaptain Sebastián receives the orders with visible relief.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He bows crisply. \"It will be done. One man at the gate, rotating shifts. The rest in the cottage, always ready but not... present.\"\n\n\nHe hesitates, then speaks more quietly.\n\n\n\"I have served in garrisons and on campaign, Majesty. I know how to protect a wall. But protecting children...\" He shakes his head. \"I did not know how to do it without making them prisoners. I thought vigilance meant visibility. I was wrong.\"\n\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\n\"We will watch the roads. We will know every face that approaches. We will drill responses to every threat I can imagine. But the children will not see us unless they seek us out—or unless they scream for help.\"\n\n\nA ghost of a smile crosses his weathered face.\n\n\n\"The princess taught them that, I hear. To scream. To fight. To make noise.\" He nods approvingly. \"Good. A child who knows to scream is harder to take quietly. Better than ten guards hovering.\"\n\n\n\nThe Days That Follow\n\n\nThe transformation is not instant, but it is steady.\n\n\nThe single guard at the gate becomes a familiar presence—not a jailer but a protector, someone who waves to the children when they pass and knows all their names. The other guards, glimpsed occasionally in the cottage doorway or walking the perimeter at dawn, fade into the background of daily life.\n\n\nThe children play in the garden without eyes following their every movement.\n\n\nCatalina climbs trees.\n\n\nPedro practices his swordwork against a wooden post, dreaming of knighthood.\n\n\nGonzalito maps the entire property, every path and hiding spot committed to memory.\n\n\nLucía draws in the sunshine, her portraits growing more confident each day.\n\n\nInés adopts a garden toad and names it Brother Fernando, after the prince. No one has the heart to tell her toads do not live long in captivity. When it escapes three days later, she declares that Brother Fernando has \"gone on a quest\" and seems content.\n\n\nAnd Fernando himself—the real Fernando, your son and heir—toddles through this small kingdom with the cheerful obliviousness of a two-year-old, loved and watched and blissfully unaware of the weight that will one day settle on his small shoulders.\n\n\n\nDoña Beatriz finds you before you return to Toledo.\n\n\n\"The household is not perfect,\" she says. \"We still need better tutors—or at least, we need these tutors to become better. Fray Ambrosio is trying, but he has decades of dull habit to overcome. Father Nikephoros shows promise. Sister Margarita...\" She smiles. \"Sister Margarita has found her calling. I have never seen a nun so happy to talk about shepherds and lions.\"\n\n\nShe folds her hands.\n\n\n\"But the bones are good now, Juan. The bones are right. The rest is just... patience. Time. The slow work of growing.\"\n\n\nShe looks toward the garden, where the sound of children's laughter drifts through the afternoon air.\n\n\n\"Thank you for trusting me with them. I will not fail you again.\"\n\n\n\nWhat would you like to address next?\n\n\nThe expedition has succeeded. The household is reformed. The children are thriving.\n\n\nBut the kingdom does not pause for happy endings. There is still:\n\n\nThe Marinid Sultan's reaction to the Salé raid (unresolved)\n\nThe Ottoman negotiations and the meeting with Sultan Murad II\n\nThe ongoing work in Constantinople\n\nQueen Lucia's recovery and return to her duties\n\nThe African ventures and Prince Henry's continued exploration\n\nWhatever else the autumn and winter of 1435-1436 may bring"
