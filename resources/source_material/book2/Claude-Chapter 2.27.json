Let me summarize for Chapter 2.27:\n\nBased on Chapter 2.26, we are at:\n- Date: May 12, 1434 (night) - Juan is preparing to depart Constantinople for Rhodes\n- Juan has been in Constantinople about 4 weeks\n- Key developments:\n  - He's been named \"Defensor Romaniae\" by Emperor John VIII\n  - He has 915 knights in Constantinople (581 from voyage + 300 under Sotomayor + 34 recovered from illness)\n  - The Council established the Joint Treasury and other foundational documents\n  - The Ottoman embassy was expelled\n  - Lucia is pregnant (5½ months), they need to get to Naples before delivery\n  - They plan to depart in \"a few days\" - about 3 days for preparations\n  - Commander Fernán is preparing the ships\n\nThe next chapter should pick up where we left off - the final preparations for departure from Constantinople.\n\nLet me provide a brief orientation for the player to continue.\n\n\nNow I have the full context. Here's where we stand:\n\n\n\nChapter 2.27: The Departure\n\n\nDate: May 12, 1434 (Night)\nLocation: Constantinople — Palace of Blachernae\n\n\n\nThe final council meeting has ended. The foundational documents of the Apokatastasis are complete—the Charter of Joint Treasury, the Decree of Thracian Reservation, the formal arrangements between Castile and Byzantium that give structure to this grand partnership.\n\n\nEmperor John VIII has retired to his chambers. The Byzantine commanders have dispersed to oversee their various preparations. Outside, the great city sleeps fitfully under a crescent moon—915 Castilian knights rest in barracks and quarters scattered across the ancient capital, their white banners a strange new sight among the Byzantine purple.\n\n\nQueen Lucia awaits in your chambers. The child stirs within her—five and a half months now. Naples and the delivery loom ahead, but first Rhodes, and the long voyage home.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán reports the fleet will be ready to depart in three days. The ships are being inspected, supplies loaded, crews organized.\n\n\nThe Ottoman embassy has been expelled. The Sultan knows what has happened here. The question—as Kantakouzenos said—is not whether Murad can break the peace. It is whether he will, and when.\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

How great it is that all who worship his name have much monuments available to praise him.\n\n\nAs A latin king, I am often reminded of what divides us. What makes us different.

It is no secret that their treasury is empty and that with my help the tribute obligation shall be paid without trouble.\n\n\nI hope that I can meet you when I deliver the tribute.

Then stop and wait for the player's next action.\n\n\n\nThe candles burn low in the chamber as you write.

The letters form right to left across the page, each word placed with care.\n\n\nWhen it is finished, you read it back to yourself. The theological questions are genuine—you have wondered about these things since the first mass conversions at Alcalá. But they also serve a purpose. A man who dismisses such questions reveals himself as closed. A man who engages them...\n\n\nYou seal the letter with your personal seal, not the royal arms of Castile. This is a communication between men, not kingdoms. Not yet.\n\n\n\nFrom the adjoining chamber, you hear movement. Lucia appears in the doorway, wrapped in a silk robe, one hand resting on the curve of her belly. Her eyes are heavy with interrupted sleep.\n\n\n\"Tomorrow?\" She does not sound distressed—merely adjusting. \"Captain Fernán said three days.\"\n\n\nShe moves closer, peering at the document on your desk. Her Latin is excellent, her Arabic nonexistent, but she recognizes the flowing script.\n\n\n\"You write to the Sultan.\" A statement, not a question.

This is a good moment for character interaction. Lucia is intelligent and has grown significantly through the campaign - she's no longer the shy 17-year-old from the beginning. She's now about 20 (the database says 17 but that seems to be from an earlier point - actually checking the database it says she's 17 born 1415, and we're in May 1434, so she'd be about 19 now).\n\nLet me think about what Lucia would think of this letter:\n\n1. She's politically astute now - she's been queen through the entire Reconquista and has grown confident\n2. She's pregnant and wants to get to Naples safely\n3. She might have concerns about Juan meeting with the Sultan\n4. She might notice the theological framing - is it genuine or strategic?\n5. She knows Juan well enough to see both his sincerity and his political calculation\n\nI should have her listen, then offer a thoughtful response that shows her character growth while also being realistic about her concerns. She shouldn't just praise it - she should engage substantively.\n\nI need to stop after she speaks so Juan can respond.\n\n\nLucia settles into the chair beside your desk, drawing the robe closer against the night chill. You translate the letter paragraph by paragraph—the Arabic flowing into Castilian, the theological questions, the offer of tribute delivery, the request for a meeting.\n\n\nShe listens without interrupting, her dark eyes following the script on the page even though she cannot read it. When you finish, she is quiet for a long moment, one hand absently tracing circles on her belly.\n\n\n\"It is... not what I expected,\" she says finally. \"I thought it would be more...\" She searches for the word. \"Demanding. You have just been named Defensor Romaniae. You expelled his embassy. And yet you write to him like a scholar seeking discourse.\"\n\n\nShe rises, moving to the window where the lights of Constantinople flicker in the darkness below. The Golden Horn lies black and still beyond.\n\n\n\"The questions about faith—are they genuine, or are they meant to disarm him?\" She glances back at you. \"I ask because I cannot tell, and I have known you three years now. If I cannot tell, perhaps he will not be able to tell either. Perhaps that is the point.\"\n\n\nShe turns fully to face you, arms crossed beneath her breasts.\n\n\n\"And this meeting you propose. On neutral ground.\" Her voice is careful now. \"You would go yourself? To meet with the man who took Thessalonica? Who holds Constantinople's fate in his hand?\"\n\n\nShe pauses, and something flickers across her face—the old fear, the one she has learned to master but never fully banished.\n\n\n\"What does Murad gain by meeting you, Juan? What does he learn that he does not already know?\""

This is a moment of intimacy between husband and wife, discussing strategy.\n\nLucia is intelligent and has her own perspective. She should engage with this reasoning - perhaps agreeing, perhaps raising concerns, but as a partner in thought. She's five and a half months pregnant, they're about to depart for Naples, and Juan has just made major commitments in Constantinople.\n\nI should have her respond thoughtfully, perhaps probe a bit more, but not lecture. She's learning to be a queen who engages with statecraft. This is a quiet, intimate moment.\n\nI need to stop and let Juan respond after she speaks - not continue the scene too far.\n\n\nLucia nods slowly, absorbing this. She moves back toward you, lowering herself onto the edge of the desk with the careful movements of a woman whose balance has shifted with pregnancy.\n\n\n\"Time,\" she repeats. \"Yes. Time is what everyone needs and no one has enough of.\" She looks down at the letter again, at the elegant Arabic script. \"And the tribute—you pay it from Byzantine coffers that you have filled. So Murad receives his gold, Constantinople keeps its peace a while longer, and you...\"\n\n\nShe tilts her head, studying you with that sharp intelligence that first surprised you in Naples, when you realized Alfonso's quiet niece was watching and understanding far more than anyone credited her for.\n\n\n\"You make yourself essential to both sides. The Byzantines cannot defend themselves without you. And if Murad wants his tribute delivered reliably, he must deal with you as well.\" A small smile crosses her lips. \"My uncle Alfonso would admire this.

Let me break down what Juan wants to do:\n\n1. Inspect wall militia drills and ensure equipment\n2. Ensure foundries receive ore for cannon production\n3. Attend and encourage men joining the themata (Byzantine military districts/units being reconstituted)\n4. Attend final services in Hagia Sophia\n5. Give final instructions to Military Order soldiers\n6. Check on the ancient claims registration and court adjudication\n7. Visit the court to see how the claims list is shaping out\n\nThis is a good opportunity to show the passage of time and the various activities without generating dialogue for Juan. I should narrate these events, show what Juan observes, and perhaps introduce some interesting details or minor complications.\n\nLet me think about what each of these would look like:\n\n1. Wall militia drills - The Byzantines are training local citizens to defend the walls. Juan would want to see their quality and ensure they have proper equipment.\n\n2. Foundries and cannons - Constantinople needs artillery. This is a significant undertaking - they need bronze, skilled workers, etc.\n\n3. Themata recruitment - The Byzantine military districts are being reconstituted. Men are joining the reformed military.\n\n4. Hagia Sophia services - A final mass in the great cathedral before departure.\n\n5. Military Order instructions - The 1,000 knights (or however many are there) need clear orders for after Juan leaves.\n\n6. Ancient claims registration - The system established in the Charter of the Latin Courts and other documents, where nobles can register ancient claims to territories.\n\n7. Visiting the court and list - Seeing how the claim registration is going.\n\nI should also think about what the final tally of claims might look like. This would be interesting information for Juan to learn. Let me consider what nobles might have registered claims.\n\nFrom the project files, I know:\n- The Taktikon of Romania established ranks\n- The Chrysobull of the Choice offered territorial grants\n- The Charter of Latin Courts established jurisdiction\n\n\n- The Lost Imperial Titles document catalogued available titles\n\nI'll create a realistic picture of claim registrations, balancing success and challenges. The process will involve strategic rolls to determine the outcomes of various administrative and military preparations.\n\nJuan observes the claims registration process, focusing on the diverse groups seeking land rights. Western crusader nobles trace ancestral holdings, Byzantine nobles reinforce existing claims, and new hopefuls seek potential grants. The scene unfolds over three days, revealing the complex landscape of territorial ambitions and bureaucratic maneuvering.\n\n\nLucia watches you for a moment longer, something softening in her expression at your answer. Then she rises, pressing a kiss to your forehead.\n\n\n\"Three days, then. I will be ready.\"\n\n\n\nThe Final Days\n\n\nMay 13-15, 1434\n\n\n\nThe Wall Militia\n\n\nThe morning finds you on the Theodosian Walls, where Kantakouzenos has assembled three hundred of the new politikoi stratoitai—citizen soldiers recruited from Constantinople's guilds and neighborhoods. They drill with spears and shields in the shadow of the great towers, their movements ragged but earnest.\n\n\nYou walk the line with Kantakouzenos, observing. The men are shopkeepers, craftsmen, fishermen—not soldiers. But they show up. They drill. Some have purchased their own equipment; others make do with what the depleted imperial armories can provide.\n\n\n\"Six months ago, I could not have gathered sixty,\" Kantakouzenos says quietly. \"Now they come because they believe there is something worth defending. Because they have seen Western knights on their walls who did not come to loot.\"\n\n\nThe equipment situation is mixed. Perhaps half have proper spears and shields. The rest carry an assortment of older weapons—some dating to the last century. You make note of what is needed: five hundred spears, three hundred shields, leather jacks for those who cannot afford mail.\n\n\n\nThe Foundries\n\n\nThe imperial foundries in the Mangana district have been dormant for years—bronze too expensive, craftsmen scattered, demand nonexistent. Now, with Castilian gold and the promise of ore shipments from Trebizond and Venetian traders, Master Theodoros Kataphraktis is attempting to resurrect them.\n\n\nYou find him covered in soot, arguing with a supplier over the quality of Cypriot copper. The foundry is functional but limited—one working furnace where once there were six.\n\n\n\"If the ore arrives as promised, Domine,\" Theodoros tells you, wiping his hands, \"we can cast two small bombards by autumn. Perhaps four by spring.\" He hesitates. \"We have the knowledge. What we lack is tin for proper bronze. The Venetians control the trade and their prices...\" He spreads his hands.\n\n\nYou add it to the list of problems requiring solutions.\n\n\n\nThe Themata\n\n\nIn the courtyard of the old Boukoleon Palace, now serving as a mustering ground, you observe the men who have answered the call to reconstitute the themata—the ancient Byzantine military districts.\n\n\nThe numbers are modest but real: 847 men have registered since the Chrysobull of the Choice was proclaimed. Most are younger sons, men without inheritance, Greeks who see in the reformed military a path to land and status their fathers could never have offered them. A handful are veterans—graying men who remember the disasters of the last decades and have come, perhaps against their better judgment, to try once more.\n\n\nRaoul the Elder, Captain of the Tagmata, walks you through the rolls. \"They are raw, Domine. But they are ours. Not mercenaries who will flee when the gold runs short. Not Latins with their own agendas.\" He pauses. \"No offense intended.\"\n\n\nThe men drill with a mix of Byzantine and Western techniques—Raoul has been learning from Captain Fernán, adapting what works. You see the influence in their formations, the way they hold their shields.\n\n\n\nHagia Sophia\n\n\nOn the evening of May 14th, you attend vespers in the Great Church.\n\n\nThe Hagia Sophia swallows sound and light alike, its vast dome floating impossibly overhead, golden mosaics glittering in candlelight that seems wholly inadequate to fill such immensity. The Latin services you know feel small here, contained—this space was built for mysteries that dwarf the individual soul.\n\n\nEmperor John VIII stands across the nave, surrounded by his court. You have not spoken privately since the final council meeting. The liturgy is Greek, incomprehensible to you in its specifics but overwhelming in its antiquity. This same service, these same words, have been sung in this space for nine hundred years.\n\n\nWhen it ends, the Emperor catches your eye across the crowded nave. He inclines his head—a gesture of acknowledgment, perhaps of something more.\n\n\nYou do not speak. Sometimes presence is enough.\n\n\n\nThe Military Orders\n\n\nThe morning of May 15th, you gather the commanders of the Military Order forces in the Blachernae's great hall. Don Juan de Sotomayor's 300 knights who have held the walls since August. The 600 who sailed with you from Castile. Fifteen who have recovered from illness or injury.\n\n\n915 knights under the white banner, soon to be reduced by your departure.\n\n\nYou will take 200 with you—your personal guard and escort for the journey to Rhodes and then Naples. The remaining 715 will stay under Don Juan de Sotomayor's command, the largest concentration of Western heavy cavalry in Constantinople's defense.\n\n\nThe Master of Alcántara receives your final instructions with the gravity they deserve. He is to coordinate with Kantakouzenos on wall defense, with Raoul on field operations, with the Emperor on strategic decisions. He is not to act unilaterally. He is not to provoke the Ottomans. He is to defend, to train, to wait.\n\n\n\"And if the Sultan moves before you return, Your Majesty?\" Don Juan asks quietly.\n\n\n\"Then you hold the walls until relief arrives or until there are no walls left to hold.\"\n\n\nHe bows. He understands.\n\n\n\nThe Court of Claims\n\n\nThe Tribunal Latinorum, established by your Charter of the Latin Courts, has been operating for less than a month. You find it housed in a wing of the Blachernae, three Byzantine jurists and two Castilian legal scholars working through a growing pile of documents.\n\n\nChief Justice Demetrios Chrysoloras rises at your entrance, clearly not expecting a royal visit. Parchments cover every surface.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, we are... the work proceeds. Perhaps not as quickly as—\"\n\n\nYou wave him to continue and settle in to observe.\n\n\nThe claims fall into several categories:\n\n\nCrusader Descent Claims: 23 petitions from Western nobles claiming lands their ancestors held after 1204. Most cite the Latin Empire's grants—Thessaly, Achaea, Athens, the islands. The documentation varies wildly. Some have original charters, seals intact. Others have family traditions and nothing more.\n\n\nByzantine Restoration Claims: 14 petitions from Greek noble families seeking recognition of lands lost to Ottoman conquest. These are simpler legally—the families exist, the lands existed, only the Turks stand between claim and reality.\n\n\nNew Grant Petitions: 31 requests from knights and nobles seeking lands promised in the Chrysobull of the Choice. These require no adjudication yet—the grants depend on conquest that has not happened.\n\n\nDisputed Claims: 8 cases where multiple parties claim the same territory. The Duchy of Athens alone has three claimants, each with documentation of varying quality.\n\n\nChrysoloras shows you the most contentious: a Burgundian knight named Guillaume de Chateauneuf claiming the Principality of Achaea through descent from the Villehardouin line, opposed by a Navarrese company captain who holds actual possession of several fortresses there.\n\n\n\"The law favors documented descent,\" Chrysoloras explains carefully. \"But possession... possession is also a form of right, is it not?\"\n\n\nThe question hangs in the air. These are the decisions that will shape whatever coalition you are building—and you will not be here to make them.\n\n\n\nThe sun is setting over the Golden Horn. Tomorrow morning, the fleet sails.\n\n\nWhat final matters require your attention?"

This is a good historical question that requires accurate information.\n\nLet me think about what I know:\n\n1. The Latin Empire of Constantinople lasted from 1204 to 1261\n2. Michael VIII Palaiologos recaptured Constantinople in 1261\n3. However, the Byzantine reconquest was not complete - many Latin states survived:\n\n**Latin states that survived after 1261:**\n- The Principality of Achaea (Morea) - held by the Villehardouins until 1278, then passed through various Western hands (Angevins of Naples, etc.)\n- The Duchy of Athens - held by the de la Roche family, then the Brienne family, then conquered by the Catalan Company in 1311\n- The Duchy of the Archipelago (Naxos) - held by the Sanudo family, then Crispo family, survived until Ottoman conquest\n- The County of Cephalonia - various Latin lords\n- Venetian territories - Crete, Euboea (Negroponte), various islands and ports\n- Genoese territories - Pera/Galata, Chios, various trading posts\n- The Knights of Rhodes (Hospitallers) - took Rhodes in 1309\n\nSo in reality, the Byzantines did NOT regain all the Latin territories. Many Latin principalities continued to exist in Greece and the Aegean well into the 14th and 15th centuries. Some were eventually conquered by the Ottomans, some by other powers.\n\nThe situation in 1434:\n- Duchy of Athens: Conquered by Catalans in 1311, then by the Florentine Acciaiuoli family in 1388 - they held it until Ottoman conquest in 1456\n- Principality of Achaea: Very complex - by 1434 it was fragmented, partly held by Navarrese Company, partly by Byzantine despots of the Morea (Palaiologos family at Mystras)\n\n\n- Venetian and Genoese maritime powers maintained strategic footholds\n- Hospitallers controlled key Aegean islands\n\nThe territorial landscape remained deeply fragmented, with multiple powers competing for control. Byzantine diplomatic and military efforts couldn't fully dislodge Latin presence, creating a complex geopolitical environment of shifting alliances and contested territories.\n\nCrusader descent claims presented intricate legal and political challenges, with some Latin families retaining land rights while others had been displaced generations earlier. Military Orders' compositions were more nuanced than simple heavy cavalry, incorporating diverse troop types like sergeants, crossbowmen, and supporting forces.\n\n\nYou're right—I'll correct that. The Military Order forces are mixed composition: knights (heavy cavalry), sergeants (medium cavalry and infantry), men-at-arms, crossbowmen, and supporting troops. The 915 figure represents the full force, not 915 heavy cavalry knights.\n\n\n\nAs for your historical question:\n\n\nChief Justice Chrysoloras sets down his quill, recognizing a genuine inquiry rather than a procedural matter.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty asks a question that has vexed Byzantine jurisprudence for two centuries.\" He gestures to a stack of documents. \"The short answer is: no, we never accepted them. The long answer is considerably more complicated.\"\n\n\nHe moves to a map pinned to the wall—a rough sketch of Greece and the Aegean.\n\n\n\"When the Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos reclaimed Constantinople in 1261, he recovered the City. But the Frankish states?\" He traces the Peloponnese, Attica, the islands. \"Many survived. Some survive still.\"\n\n\nThe Principality of Achaea (the Morea): \"The Villehardouins held it until 1278, then it passed to the Angevins of Naples. Today it is... chaos. The Navarrese Company holds fortresses in the west. Our own Despots at Mystras—the Emperor's brothers—hold the east. The title of 'Prince of Achaea' is claimed by multiple parties, none of whom control all of it.\"\n\n\nThe Duchy of Athens: \"The de la Roche family, then Brienne, then conquered by the Catalan Company in 1311—brutal mercenaries who held it for decades. Now the Florentine family Acciaiuoli rules from the Acropolis. They style themselves 'Dukes of Athens' and have held it for nearly fifty years.\"\n\n\nThe Islands: \"The Venetians hold Crete, Euboea, countless smaller islands. The Duchy of the Archipelago—Naxos and its neighbors—remains under Latin lords, the Crispo family now. These were never recovered.\"\n\n\nChrysoloras turns back to you, his expression careful.\n\n\n\"The Byzantine legal position has always been clear: the Latin Empire was illegitimate, born of treachery and theft. Every title granted by the Latin Emperors was therefore void from inception. The lands belong to Rome—to us—by ancient right.\"\n\n\n\"But reality...\" He spreads his hands. \"We could not reconquer everything. For two hundred years, Latin lords have held Greek soil, married Greek wives, ruled Greek peasants. Their grandchildren speak Greek. Some have converted to Orthodoxy. Are they usurpers? Legally, yes. Practically?\"\n\n\nHe picks up one of the petitions—the Burgundian claiming Achaea.\n\n\n\"This man's ancestor was granted the Principality by a Latin Emperor we do not recognize. His family lost possession generations ago—first to the Angevins, then fragmented among various claimants. He has documents. He has lineage. He has no army and no actual land.\"\n\n\n\"Meanwhile, the Navarrese captain who opposes him has no legal claim whatsoever—he is a mercenary who seized fortresses by force. But he has men and walls.\"\n\n\nChrysoloras meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty's Tribunal must decide: Do we adjudicate based on the law as Byzantium understands it—in which case most Latin claims are void? Or based on Latin legal traditions—which recognized these grants? Or based on practical reality—whoever holds the land owns it?\"\n\n\n\"The Emperor has not clarified which standard we should apply. I suspect because any choice will offend someone whose support you need.\"\n\n\n\nThe question beneath the question is clear: What kind of coalition are you building? One based on Byzantine legitimacy, Latin crusader tradition, or naked pragmatism?"

They're essentially rejecting the legitimacy of claims based on the 1204 conquest, but leaving open the possibility that those claimants could earn titles through actual contribution to the reconquest.\n\nThis is a nuanced position:\n1. No automatic restoration of Latin claims from post-1204 grants - these are legally void\n2. But claimants can earn titles through military contribution\n3. Ancient claims can be noted and considered when granting titles, but contribution matters\n\nThe user also asks an important question: are those making ancient claims actually contributing to the fight, or are they just trying to get wealth without effort?\n\nLet me have Chrysoloras respond to this, and provide information about which claimants are actually present and contributing versus those who are just sending petitions from afar.\n\n\nChrysoloras stares at you for a long moment. Then, slowly, a smile spreads across his weathered face—the smile of a man who has just heard something he thought he would never hear from a Latin king.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" He stops, composes himself. \"Forgive me.

They have brought swords, not just parchments.\"\n\n\nSir Guillaume de Chateauneuf (Burgundian) - Claims Principality of Achaea through Villehardouin descent. Has arrived with 12 men-at-arms at his own expense. Currently serving on the walls under Don Juan de Sotomayor. His claim is the strongest on paper—direct documented lineage—but Achaea is held by the Navarrese and the Despotate of Mystras.\n\nSer Marco Sanudo (Venetian) - Claims the Duchy of the Archipelago (Naxos). His family actually held this title until the Crispo family displaced them three generations ago. He has brought 8 men and a small galley. The irony: the islands are not Ottoman-held, so there is nothing to \"reconquer\"—his real quarrel is with fellow Latins.\n\nDon Pedro de Rocafort (Aragonese) - Claims various Catalan Company holdings in Thessaly and Boeotia. His grandfather rode with the Company. He has brought 15 men. The lands he claims are actually Ottoman-held, making his the most practical claim for reconquest.\n\nSir Anselm de Cayeux (French) - Claims the Marquisate of Bodonitsa through maternal descent. Has brought only himself and two servants, but has personally fought in three skirmishes on the walls. The Marquisate, a small territory north of Athens, fell to the Ottomans in 1414.\n\n\n\nPILE TWO: Claimants Who Sent Representatives (7 petitions)\n\n\n\"These lords sent lawyers, factors, or younger sons. They want their claims registered in case reconquest happens—but they risk nothing themselves.\"\n\n\nChrysoloras reads names: minor French nobility claiming fragments of the old Latin Empire, Italian merchant families seeking recognition of commercial rights their ancestors held, a Hospitaller commander on Rhodes claiming his Order's ancient properties in Constantinople itself.\n\n\n\"The Hospitaller claim is... complicated,\" Chrysoloras notes carefully. \"Grand Master de Lastic may expect these properties restored when you visit Rhodes.\"\n\n\n\nPILE THREE: Petitions Sent by Letter Only (12 petitions)\n\n\n\"These arrived by messenger. The claimants sit in France, Burgundy, Naples, Aragon—wherever their families settled after losing their Eastern holdings generations ago. They have sent documents. They have sent nothing else.\"\n\n\nHe sets this pile aside with visible disdain.\n\n\n\"Several are from families who have not set foot east of Venice in a hundred years. They learned of Your Majesty's arrival and the Apokatastasis, and they thought: perhaps I can recover my great-great-grandfather's stolen lands without lifting a finger.\"\n\n\n\nChrysoloras looks up from the sorted piles.\n\n\n\"So. Four men who fight. Seven who hedge their bets. Twelve who dream of inheritance without effort.\"\n\n\n\"Under Your Majesty's ruling: the four receive consideration proportional to their contribution. The seven and twelve receive nothing unless they come themselves and bleed for what they claim.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"The Emperor will be... relieved. He feared you would demand restoration of Latin claims as the price of your aid. Many at court whispered this was your true purpose—to rebuild the Latin Empire under Castilian domination.\"\n\n\n\"This ruling says otherwise. It says: the past is past. What matters is what you do now.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to the petitions.\n\n\n\"Shall I draft the formal decree for your seal before you depart? And what of the Greek claimants—the 14 Byzantine families seeking recognition of lands lost to the Turks? The same standard? Contribution before restoration?\""

Are there Greeks making big claims without contributing men and resources to the fight?\n\nThis is a great question that shows Juan's fairness - he's applying the same standard to Greeks as to Latins. He wants to know if there are Greek nobles claiming territories they lost to the Ottomans but who aren't actually contributing to the defense or reconquest effort.\n\nI should have Chrysoloras answer this honestly. The answer should probably be yes - there are likely Greek noble families who lost lands to Ottoman conquest and want them back, but who may not be contributing much themselves. This creates an interesting political dynamic:\n\n1. Some Greek families lost lands generations ago and have been living in reduced circumstances in Constantinople or elsewhere\n2. Some may be too impoverished to contribute much\n3. Some may be wealthy but cautious, waiting to see if reconquest actually happens before committing\n4. Some may be actively contributing\n\nThis mirrors the Latin situation and shows that human nature is universal - some people want something for nothing regardless of their ethnicity or religion.\n\nI should present a realistic mix and let Juan make decisions about this.\n\n\nChrysoloras's expression shifts—a flicker of discomfort. He is a Greek himself, and you have just asked him to apply the same unsparing standard to his own people that you applied to the Latins.\n\n\nHe is silent for a moment. Then he nods slowly, respecting the question.\n\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. There are.\"\n\n\nHe moves to the second stack—the 14 Byzantine petitions—and begins sorting with the same methodical honesty.\n\n\n\nPILE ONE: Greeks Present and Contributing (5 petitions)\n\n\n\"These families have bled for Constantinople. Some have bled for generations.\"\n\n\nThe Palaiologos cadets - Distant cousins of the Emperor claiming restoration of their branch's lands in Thrace, lost to Murad I. Three brothers currently serve in the Tagmata. Their father died defending Thessalonica in 1430.\n\nThe Bryennios family - Lord Bryennios himself, who spoke for the committed noble houses at your council. Claims ancestral estates near Adrianople, lost sixty years ago. He has committed 40 men to the themata and personally commands a section of wall.\n\nThe Notaras family - Wealthy, influential, and actually present. Loukas Notaras, the Megas Doux, claims commercial properties in Galata and lands in Bithynia. His family has funded wall repairs from their own purse. His claim is complicated by the fact that some \"his\" properties in Galata are currently held by Genoese who will dispute any restoration.\n\nThe Kantakouzenos descendants - Not the Strategos himself, but a related branch claiming lands in the Morea their family held when a Kantakouzenos sat on the throne a century ago. Two sons serve on the walls. A third died last winter in a skirmish.\n\nThe Laskaris remnants - A family that once held the Empire itself during the exile at Nicaea. Now reduced to minor nobility. They claim lands in Bithynia near Nicaea—symbolically potent, practically Ottoman for over a century. The current head, an old man named Theodoros, has given his grandsons to the Tagmata and his fortune—what remains of it—to wall repairs.\n\n\n\nPILE TWO: Greeks Who Claim Much But Contribute Little (6 petitions)\n\n\nChrysoloras's voice tightens slightly.\n\n\n\"These are... more difficult to speak of.\"\n\n\nThe Doukas Patriarch - He spoke at your council, representing the 'great houses.' His family claims vast estates in Macedonia and Thrace—lands lost to the Ottomans before he was born. Yet the Doukas contribution to the defense has been... measured. They attend councils. They offer advice. They have committed 11 men.\" He pauses. \"The Doukas are wealthy, Your Majesty. They could do far more. They choose not to, because they are waiting to see which way the wind blows.\"\n\nThe Philanthropenos family - Ancient military aristocracy, claiming estates in Asia Minor lost two generations ago. They have sent a letter of support. No men. No gold. They live comfortably in Constantinople on what remains of their wealth and see no reason to risk it.\n\nThe Raoul cadets - Not Raoul the Elder, who serves honorably, but a collateral branch claiming lands in Thessaly. They have contributed nothing and currently reside in Venetian Crete, having fled Constantinople years ago. They sent a petition by messenger.\n\nThe Gabalas family - Once lords of Rhodes before the Hospitallers took it. They want... Rhodes. They have contributed two men-at-arms. Rhodes, I note, is not Ottoman-held—it belongs to your allies the Knights of Saint John.\n\nThe Asanes remnants - Bulgarian-Byzantine family claiming lands along the Danube. Lands that have been Ottoman, then Serbian, then Ottoman again. The current family head is elderly, ill, and has contributed nothing but parchment.\n\nThe Melissenos family - Claiming estates near Smyrna in Asia Minor. Lost to the Turks over a century ago. The family has intermarried with Venetians, lives mostly in Negroponte, and sent a representative—a lawyer—who departed Constantinople two weeks ago having registered the claim.\n\n\n\nPILE THREE: Petitions of the Desperate (3 petitions)\n\n\nChrysoloras's voice softens here.\n\n\n\"And then there are these.\"\n\n\nThe widow Strategopoulos - Her husband died at Thessalonica. Her sons died on the walls here, last winter. She claims nothing but the family's ancestral farm near Serres—forty acres, perhaps. She has nothing to contribute because she has nothing left. She is sixty years old and lives on church charity.\n\nThe monk Kallistos - Former soldier, now holy man. Claims nothing for himself, but petitions for the restoration of his monastery's lands near Nicaea—lands that supported an orphanage before the Ottomans came. He has contributed his prayers and his labor repairing walls despite his age.\n\nThe Komnenos fisherman - Yes, that Komnenos. A direct descendant of the imperial dynasty, reduced over centuries to a man who mends nets in the harbor. He claims \"the lands of my ancestors.\" He cannot read or write; a priest wrote his petition for him. He does not know what lands his ancestors held. He simply knows they were emperors once, and he catches fish.\n\n\n\nChrysoloras sets down the final petition and looks at you.\n\n\n\"The same standard, Your Majesty? Contribution before restoration?\"\n\n\nHis voice carries something complicated—pride that you would ask, discomfort at what the answer reveals, and beneath it a question: How will you judge the widow, the monk, and the fisherman who have nothing to give but what they have already lost?"

Notaras was expelled from the palace after evidence was found of his correspondence with the Ottoman court - letters about food supplies, wall conditions, defender numbers, and negotiations for his survival under Ottoman rule. Some letters were eight months old, some more recent.\n\nThe summary from Chapter 2.26 mentions \"Notaras trial (scheduled for May 13)\" - so there was a trial scheduled. The current date is May 15, 1434 (the final day before departure). So the trial should have already happened or be in progress.\n\nI need to create a d100 table for how Notaras's trial goes. Let me think about the factors:\n\n**Success Factors (things working in favor of conviction/justice):**\n- Documentary evidence of treason - letters to Ottoman officials\n- Evidence found in his own locked chest\n- The Emperor was being held in soft captivity by Notaras\n- Greek nobles (Philanthropenos, Kantakouzenos, Raoul) liberated the Emperor\n- The Emperor signed the Charter of Imperial Tagmata - he's free now\n- Notaras's guards were expelled from the palace\n- The evidence is damning - information about defenses, negotiations for his survival\n\n**Failure Factors (things working against conviction/justice):**\n- Notaras is still wealthy and has influence\n- He has a household of guards (about 80 marched out when expelled)\n- His family (the Notaras family) is powerful\n- Some nobles might fear the precedent of trying one of their own\n- Byzantine legal procedures might be slow or corruptible\n- The Emperor might be reluctant to execute someone so prominent\n- Notaras might have allies who could interfere\n\n**Possible outcomes:**\n- Full conviction and execution for treason\n- Conviction with lesser punishment (exile, confiscation of property)\n- Trial delayed or bogged down in procedure\n- Notaras escapes before verdict\n- Notaras attempts some kind of counter-move\n\n\n- Acquittal (unlikely given evidence but possible with corruption)\n\nI'll develop a nuanced probability table that reflects the complex political landscape. The evidence is strong, but Byzantine politics are notoriously intricate, with multiple potential paths for Notaras's fate.\n\n\nYou're correct—Notaras was arrested after the palace was secured, and his trial was scheduled for May 13th. Let me find the details.\n\n\n\nChrysoloras pauses, his face falling slightly.\n\n\n\"Ah. Yes. The Megas Doux.\" He sets down the Notaras petition. \"I should not have included this. The family's claims are... complicated by the trial.\"\n\n\nHe glances toward the door, as if worried about being overheard.\n\n\n\"Loukas Notaras stands accused of proditio—high treason. The evidence recovered from his chambers is damning: correspondence with Ottoman officials detailing our food supplies, wall conditions, the number of defenders. Negotiations for his family's survival should the city fall.\"\n\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\n\"The trial began two days ago before a tribunal of five: two imperial judges, Lord Bryennios representing the committed noble houses, a representative of the Patriarch—who insisted on Church involvement—and Strategos Kantakouzenos representing military interests.\"\n\n\n\nNotaras Trial — d100 Table\n\n\nThe Accused: Loukas Notaras, former Megas Doux (Grand Duke), wealthiest man in Constantinople\n\n\nThe Evidence:\n\n\nLetters in Ottoman Turkish to Sultan's court officials (some 8+ months old)\n\nInformation about Constantinople's defenses shared with the enemy\n\nNegotiations for personal/family survival under Ottoman rule\n\nEffective imprisonment of the Emperor through control of palace guards\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nDocumentary evidence is damning and authentic\n\nThe Emperor personally witnessed his own soft captivity\n\nGreek nobles (not Latins) liberated the palace—this is Greek justice\n\nNotaras's guards were expelled; he has no armed force in the city\n\nKantakouzenos and Bryennios are committed to conviction\n\nPublic sentiment has shifted against the old order after Juan's reforms\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nNotaras remains enormously wealthy—bribes are possible\n\nThe Patriarch's representative may seek to protect a major Church donor\n\nSome nobles fear the precedent of executing one of their own\n\nByzantine legal tradition favors exile over execution for nobility\n\nNotaras's family connections extend throughout the merchant class\n\nThe Emperor may be reluctant to order death for a man he feared for years\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nEscape — Notaras's remaining agents smuggle him out of Constantinople before verdict. He flees to Ottoman territory, confirming his treason but denying justice. His properties are seized but the man himself is beyond reach. Humiliating for the tribunal.\n6-15\nMistrial/Procedural Collapse — The Patriarch's representative raises endless canonical objections. The trial bogs down in procedural disputes. Notaras remains imprisoned but no verdict is reached. The matter festers, unresolved.\n16-25\nAcquittal on Technicality — Notaras's lawyers argue the letters were \"diplomatic correspondence\" not treason, and that advising the Sultan of conditions is not the same as betraying the city. The tribunal splits 3-2 for acquittal. Notaras is released but stripped of offices. Outrage among the military nobles.\n26-40\nConviction with Exile — Found guilty of treason but sentenced to permanent exile rather than death. Properties confiscated. Notaras is escorted to a ship and expelled from Byzantine territory. He likely goes to Venice or Italian territories. Justice served, but incomplete.\n41-55\nConviction with Imprisonment — Found guilty. Sentenced to perpetual imprisonment in a monastery. Properties confiscated, family allowed to retain personal effects only. Notaras will live out his days as a monk under guard. The Emperor cannot bring himself to order execution.\n56-70\nConviction and Execution Ordered — The tribunal votes 4-1 (Patriarch's representative dissenting) for death. The Emperor, after visible struggle, confirms the sentence. Execution scheduled. Notaras's properties confiscated entirely. Clean resolution but the Emperor carries the weight.\n71-85\nConviction and Swift Execution — Unanimous guilty verdict. The Emperor confirms without hesitation—his years of fear have become cold resolve. Notaras is executed within days. Properties seized for the imperial treasury. A clear message sent to any who would treat with the enemy.\n86-95\nConviction with Full Exposure — Not only convicted but the trial publicly reveals the full extent of Notaras's betrayal. Additional evidence emerges during proceedings—witnesses come forward, more letters found. The execution is public. The Notaras name becomes synonymous with treachery. Other wavering nobles take note.\n96-100\nConfession and Repentance — Faced with overwhelming evidence, Notaras breaks. He confesses fully, names other Ottoman contacts in the city (if any), and begs for mercy. The confession provides valuable intelligence. He is executed but his cooperation is noted. His family is treated with more leniency—exile rather than total ruin.\n\n\nChrysoloras awaits your response, but the trial's outcome is not yet known—it began only two days ago, and Byzantine justice moves deliberately.\n\n\n\"Shall I send a clerk to inquire about the proceedings, Your Majesty?

Emperors who learn to kill without flinching can be dangerous in their own way.\n\n\n\"There is talk of a public execution. The military nobles want it—Kantakouzenos, Bryennios, the Raouls. They say the people should see that treason has consequences. The Patriarch argues for private execution, to preserve dignity and avoid spectacle.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you.\n\n\n\"You depart tomorrow morning, Your Majesty.

      "say": "Thought process: Excavated historical context to estimate confiscated wealth impact.\n\nThe user is asking about how much Notaras's confiscated wealth would add to the imperial treasury. Let me search for any information about Notaras's wealth in the project files.\n\nFrom what I recall, Notaras was described as the wealthiest man in Constantinople. I should search for specific figures or make a reasonable estimate based on historical context.\n\nLet me think about what I know:\n- The Byzantine Empire's annual revenue was mentioned as approximately 5,200 florins in the Chapter 2.26 summary\n- Notaras was the Megas Doux (Grand Duke) and described as the wealthiest man in Constantinople\n- He had a townhouse, warehouses, commercial interests, rural estates\n- He had 300 household guards - maintaining such a force would require significant wealth\n\nI should search the project files for any specific information about Notaras's wealth or Constantinople's economic situation.\n\n\nChrysoloras confers quietly with the clerk, then pulls out a wax tablet and begins scratching figures.\n\n\n\"The Megas Doux was... the wealthiest man in Constantinople. Perhaps the wealthiest man in what remains of the Empire.\" He works through the calculations carefully.\n\n\n\nNotaras Estate — Estimated Value\n\nAsset\nEstimated Value (florins)\nNotes\nTownhouse in Constantinople\n2,000-3,000\nPrime location near Blachernae, one of the finest private residences in the city\nWarehouses (3)\n1,500-2,000\nHarbor district, currently storing trade goods\nTrade goods in storage\n3,000-4,000\nSilk, spices, alum—liquid wealth\nCommercial interests\n4,000-6,000\nShares in trading ventures, loans outstanding, partnerships with Venetian and Genoese merchants\nRural estates (Thrace)\n1,000-1,500\nProductive land, though some now in Ottoman-threatened territory\nShips (2 galleys)\n2,000-2,500\nTrading vessels, well-maintained\nCoin and bullion\n5,000-8,000\nGold and silver held in personal treasury\nHousehold goods, furnishings\n500-1,000\nTapestries, plate, jewelry\nTOTAL\n19,000-28,000\n\n\nChrysoloras sets down his stylus.\n\n\n\"Call it twenty to twenty-five thousand florins in realizable value, Your Majesty. Some assets—the commercial partnerships especially—will take time to untangle. The Venetians and Genoese will claim some goods in the warehouses belong to them, not Notaras. There will be lawsuits.\"\n\n\nHe lets that figure sink in.\n\n\n\"The Byzantine Empire's annual revenue is approximately five thousand florins. The Notaras confiscation represents four to five years of imperial income in a single stroke.\"\n\n\nThought process: Contextualized confiscation's financial impact on Byzantine resources.\n\nThis is significant. The Byzantine treasury was essentially empty before Juan's intervention. The 60,000 florins Juan transferred to the joint treasury was already transformative. Now adding another 20,000-25,000 florins from the Notaras confiscation substantially increases Byzantine resources.\n\nLet me put this in context for the user.\n\n\nHe glances at the financial documents from your earlier council meetings.\n\n\n\"Combined with the sixty thousand florins Your Majesty transferred to the joint treasury... the Emperor now commands more liquid wealth than any Byzantine ruler since before Thessalonica fell. Perhaps since before the civil wars.\"\n\n\nA dry, almost disbelieving laugh escapes him.\n\n\n\"Notaras spent decades accumulating that fortune while the walls crumbled and the army dissolved. Now it will pay for the very defenses he was betraying to the Turks.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, a thought occurring to him.\n\n\n\"There is a certain justice in that, is there not?\""

I order the rest to be liquidated and be put towards the treasury and the war effort for now.\n\n\nNow back to the claims and those of Greek houses in particular.\n\n\nWe recognize ancient claims but only to a point. If a noble house has lost everything but is committing every son and father into the tamata, they will in time earn their titles. For those who make a lot of claims but commit not much, we cannot honour their claims just yet. An ancient claim does carry weight, but I would rather give it to a lesser noble who is really fighting for it, then to a lawyer with a claim who does not wield a sword. We do need lawyers, but we need swords more.\n\n\nI think we should count someone with a true ancient claim to have three times his men compared to someone who does not. \nThis means that someone with an ancient claim on a ducal title,. but sends 11 men, someone without an ancient claim but contributes 35 men, his claim trumps that of the one with the ancient claim as 11 x 3 is only 33 men. And we let a noble who fights personally count for 20 men.\n\n\nI think and hope that with this system, we both honour the ancient claims and give everyone the chance to also fight for it's recovery.

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed Juan's merit-based claim system and anticipated thoughtful Byzantine approval.\n\nJuan is proposing a system for adjudicating claims that balances ancient legitimacy with actual contribution. Let me break down what he's proposing:\n\n1. Ancient claims carry weight, but don't automatically grant restoration\n2. A noble with an ancient claim gets a 3x multiplier on their men\n3. A noble who fights personally counts as +20 men\n4. The total \"claim strength\" determines who gets priority\n\nSo for example:\n- Noble A: Ancient claim to Duchy X, sends 11 men but doesn't fight personally = 11 × 3 = 33 \"claim points\"\n- Noble B: No ancient claim, sends 35 men, doesn't fight personally = 35 \"claim points\"\n- Noble B wins because 35 > 33\n\nAnother example:\n- Noble C: Ancient claim, sends 10 men, fights personally = (10 × 3) + 20 = 50 \"claim points\"\n- Noble D: No ancient claim, sends 40 men, doesn't fight personally = 40 \"claim points\"\n- Noble C wins because 50 > 40\n\nThis is actually quite clever - it rewards:\n1. Those with legitimate historical claims (3x multiplier)\n2. Those who contribute men (base contribution)\n3. Those who risk their own lives (personal fighting bonus of 20)\n\nChrysoloras should react to this thoughtfully. As a Byzantine jurist, he would appreciate the elegance of a system that:\n- Doesn't completely reject ancient claims (respecting tradition and law)\n- Prioritizes actual contribution (pragmatic)\n- Values personal sacrifice (honorable)\n\nHe might have some questions or refinements to suggest, but overall this seems like a workable system that would satisfy multiple constituencies.\n\nLet me think about potential issues or questions he might raise:\n1. What about widows, monks, fishermen who have nothing to give? (The three in the \"desperate\" pile)\n2. How do we count contribution over time? (Someone who fights for a year vs someone who shows up at the end)\n\n\n3. What about naval contribution vs land forces?\n4. What about financial contribution vs military contribution?\n5. How do we verify ancient claims? Some have better documentation than others.\n\nI see Chrysoloras carefully considering the nuanced challenges of evaluating different types of contributions. Naval forces might require a different calculation than land troops, and financial support could be equally critical in a prolonged conflict. Verifying ancient claims demands meticulous historical research, potentially involving church records, family archives, and imperial documents. These complexities require a sophisticated approach that balances historical legitimacy with practical considerations.\n\n\nChrysoloras is silent for a long moment, his stylus tapping against the wax tablet as he works through the implications. Then he begins to write, translating your words into the framework of a legal formula.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty proposes...\" He speaks slowly, testing each phrase. \"A system of weighted contribution. The ancient claim is honored—tripled in weight—but not determinative. And personal valor carries its own weight, equal to twenty men.\"\n\n\nHe sketches examples:\n\n\n\nThe Contribution Formula\n\n\nClaim Strength = (Men Committed × Multiplier) + Personal Service Bonus\n\n\nAncient/legitimate claim: ×3 multiplier\n\nNo ancient claim: ×1 multiplier\n\nNoble fights personally: +20\n\n\n\nExample Applications:\n\nClaimant\nAncient Claim?\nMen\nFights Personally?\nCalculation\nTotal\nDoukas Patriarch\nYes\n11\nNo\n11 × 3\n33\nA lesser knight\nNo\n35\nNo\n35 × 1\n35\nWinner: Lesser knight\nClaimant\nAncient Claim?\nMen\nFights Personally?\nCalculation\nTotal\nLord Bryennios\nYes\n40\nYes\n(40 × 3) + 20\n140\nWealthy merchant\nNo\n100\nNo\n100 × 1\n100\nWinner: Bryennios\nClaimant\nAncient Claim?\nMen\nFights Personally?\nCalculation\nTotal\nRaoul brothers\nYes\n70\nYes (multiple)\n(70 × 3) + 20\n230\nPhilanthropenos\nYes\n0 (so far)\nNo\n0 × 3\n0\nWinner: Raoul\n\n\nChrysoloras sets down his stylus, nodding slowly.\n\n\n\"It is... elegant, Your Majesty. It threads several needles at once.\"\n\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\n\"First, it does not reject ancient claims—which would offend every noble house in the Empire and make enemies of men who might otherwise contribute. The Doukas cannot say their lineage is disrespected. It is simply outweighed by those who sacrifice more.\n\n\n\"Second, it rewards exactly what we need most: men and personal leadership. A lord who sends his sons but sits safe in Constantinople is worth less than a lord who rides beside his men. This is as it should be.\n\n\n\"Third, it creates a path for lesser nobles and new men. A knight with no ancient claim but forty men and personal valor...\" He calculates. \"Forty plus twenty, sixty points. He outweighs a great house that sends eleven men and a lawyer. This will bring hungry men to your banner—men who see a future they could never have under the old system.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, tapping the tablet thoughtfully.\n\n\n\"Fourth—and this is subtle—it encourages the ancient houses to increase their contribution rather than rest on their claims. If the Doukas wish to secure their ancestral lands, they must send more than eleven men. Their multiplier means they need contribute only one-third what a newcomer would... but they must contribute something real.\"\n\n\n\nHe frowns slightly, working through edge cases.\n\n\n\"I have some questions, Your Majesty, to ensure the formula is applied justly:\n\n\n\"Duration of service. A man who fights for two years—does he count differently than one who arrives for the final battle? Perhaps contribution should be weighted by time as well as numbers?\n\n\n\"Quality of troops. Forty peasants with spears are not forty armored knights. Should heavy cavalry count more than militia?\n\n\n\"Financial contribution. What of a man who cannot fight—too old, too ill—but gives ten thousand florins to arm others? The widow Strategopoulos has nothing. But if a wealthy merchant funds fifty soldiers, does that count as fifty men?\n\n\n\"Casualties. If a house sends forty men and thirty die in battle—do they receive credit for forty, or only the ten who survive? I would argue forty—sacrifice should be honored, not punished.\n\n\n\"The desperate cases.\" He gestures to the three petitions he had set aside—the widow, the monk, the fisherman. \"Under this formula, they have nothing. Zero contribution, zero claim strength. Yet there is something... unseemly... about telling a sixty-year-old widow that her husband's and sons' deaths count for nothing because they died before this system existed.\"\n\n\nHe looks up at you.\n\n\n\"These are not objections, Your Majesty. The system is sound. I merely wish to know how you would have us handle the margins, so the Tribunal applies your will consistently after you depart.\""

Let me think about this historically.\n\nA typical Mediterranean war galley of the 15th century would have:\n\n1. Rowers - The primary propulsion. A standard galley might have around 100-150 rowers, depending on size. In this period, rowers were often free men (not slaves as in later periods), though this varied.\n\n2. Marines/Soldiers - Fighting men who would board enemy vessels or defend against boarding. Usually 20-50 depending on the galley's size.\n\n3. Officers and sailors - Captain, navigators, sail handlers, etc. Perhaps 10-20.\n\n4. Crossbowmen/Archers - Often counted among the marines but sometimes separate.\n\nA standard war galley (not a great galley or galleass) might have:\n- Total crew: 150-200 men\n- Of which maybe 20-50 are actual fighting marines\n- The rowers could fight in emergencies but weren't primarily soldiers\n\nA Venetian \"galea sottile\" (light galley) typically had about 150-180 oarsmen plus 20-30 marines.\n\nByzantine galleys would be similar in this period, though their navy had declined significantly.\n\nChrysoloras should give a reasonable answer based on this context.\n\n\nChrysoloras nods, glad to be on firmer ground with a practical question.\n\n\n\"A war galley, Your Majesty—a proper fighting vessel of the type the Venetians and Genoese employ—typically carries between one hundred fifty and two hundred men.\"\n\n\nHe breaks it down:\n\n\n\nWar Galley Complement (Standard Mediterranean Galley)\n\nRole\nNumber\nNotes\nRowers\n100-150\nFree men in Byzantine tradition, though Venetians increasingly use convicts.

But the rowers...\"\n\n\nHe strokes his chin.\n\n\n\"A lord who provides a galley provides not just men but an enormous capital investment. A war galley costs perhaps five hundred to eight hundred florins to build, and another two hundred or more per year to maintain and crew. It is a weapon that can blockade harbors, transport troops, raid coastlines, intercept Ottoman supply ships.\"\n\n\nHe sketches some calculations.\n\n\n\"If we value heavy cavalry at five times infantry because of cost and impact... a war galley might reasonably count as the equivalent of one hundred infantry? Perhaps more? A single galley can do what a hundred foot soldiers cannot—control waters, project power across the sea.\"\n\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\n\"The Notaras confiscation includes two galleys. The Gabalas family—the ones claiming Rhodes—have access to ships through their Venetian connections but have contributed almost nothing. If galleys count heavily toward claims, it might encourage the maritime families to actually commit their vessels rather than keeping them safe in harbor while they wait to see who wins.\"\n\n\n\n\"Shall I propose a naval contribution scale for the Tribunal to refine?

The Latin conquest was illegitimate; its grants carry no legal weight.\n\n\nLatin claimants are welcome to earn titles through the contribution system on equal terms with all others. Their ancestors' crimes are not held against them—but neither do they benefit from stolen goods.\n\n\nArticle 15. Desperate Cases\n\n\nThe Emperor and the Defensor Romaniae reserve authority to grant special dispensation to:\n\n\nWidows and orphans of men who died in service before this system existed\n\nAged or infirm persons who cannot fight but have demonstrated loyalty\n\nReligious institutions that serve the common good\n\nAny case where strict application of the formula would produce manifest injustice\n\n\nSuch grants shall be examined individually and recorded separately from the normal claims process.\n\n\nArticle 16. The Notaras Precedent\n\n\nLet it be recorded that the properties of the traitor Loukas Notaras, convicted of proditio against the Empire, have been forfeit to the imperial treasury. Treason voids all claims. Those who treat with the enemy while claiming loyalty to the Empire shall lose everything.\n\n\n\nPART VII: ADMINISTRATION\n\n\nArticle 17. The Tribunal\n\n\nThe Tribunal Latinorum et Graecorum shall administer this system, maintaining:\n\n\nThe register of ancient claims\n\nThe annual muster rolls\n\nThe cumulative contribution records\n\nThe queue of pending claims awaiting reconquest\n\n\nArticle 18. Appeals\n\n\nDecisions of the Tribunal may be appealed to the Emperor or, in matters concerning Latin claimants, jointly to the Emperor and the Defensor Romaniae.\n\n\nArticle 19. Amendments\n\n\nThis Constitution may be amended only by joint decree of the Emperor and the Defensor Romaniae, or their lawful successors.\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES OF APPLICATION\n\n\nExample 1: Established House with Ancient Claim\n\n\nHouse Bryennios claims ancestral estates near Adrianople\n\n\nAncient claim: Yes (×3 multiplier)\n\nMen contributed: 40 infantry\n\nLord Bryennios fights personally: Yes (+20)\n\nCalculation: (40 × 1 × 3) + 20 = 140\n\n\nExample 2: Wealthy House, Minimal Contribution\n\n\nHouse Doukas claims vast estates in Macedonia\n\n\nAncient claim: Yes (×3 multiplier)\n\nMen contributed: 11 infantry\n\nPatriarch does not fight personally: No (+0)\n\nCalculation: (11 × 1 × 3) + 0 = 33\n\n\nHouse Bryennios outranks House Doukas despite Doukas's greater paper claims.\n\n\nExample 3: Latin Knight, No Ancient Claim\n\n\nDon Pedro de Rocafort claims Catalan Company holdings in Thessaly\n\n\nAncient claim: No—derived from conquest, not legitimate grant (×1 multiplier)\n\nMen contributed: 15 infantry\n\nFights personally: Yes (+20)\n\nCalculation: (15 × 1 × 1) + 20 = 35\n\n\nDon Pedro outranks House Doukas.\n\n\nExample 4: Naval Contribution\n\n\nA maritime house contributes one war galley and 20 light cavalry\n\n\nWar galley: 100 (infantry equivalent)\n\nLight cavalry: 20 × 3 = 60\n\nTotal weighted value: 160\n\nIf ancient claim (×3): 480\n\nIf no ancient claim (×1): 160\n\n\n\nProclaimed under our hands and seals in the City of Constantinople, in the year of Our Lord 1434.\n\n\nJuan II of Castile, Defensor Romaniae\n\n\nJohn VIII Palaiologos, Emperor of the Romans\n\n\n\nChrysoloras sets down his quill and flexes his cramped fingers.\n\n\n\"It is done, Your Majesty.

This is an important moment - the culmination of weeks of work building this alliance. The Emperor has transformed significantly during Juan's time here, from a fearful man effectively imprisoned by Notaras to someone who has signed the Apokatastasis, ordered Notaras's execution, and begun to act like a ruler again.\n\nI should play this scene with appropriate weight. The Emperor has reasons to be grateful but also reasons for concern - Juan is leaving, and Constantinople's defense now depends on whether this alliance holds across distance. The Emperor might want to discuss:\n- The execution of Notaras (tomorrow evening, after Juan departs)\n- The Constitution of Contributions and Claims\n- The letter to the Sultan\n- What happens next - when will Juan return?\n- The 715 Military Order soldiers staying behind\n- Personal matters - their relationship has grown\n\nI should stop and let Juan speak rather than having the Emperor monologue. Let me set the scene and have the Emperor greet Juan, perhaps with one or two lines, then stop for Juan's response.\n\n\nThe palace of Blachernae is quieter now than it was a week ago. The Notaras guards are gone—expelled or reassigned. Raoul's men stand at the gates, wearing the new livery of the reconstituted Tagmata. They salute as you pass.\n\n\nYou find the Emperor in his private study, a small chamber overlooking the Golden Horn. He sits by the window, a cup of wine untouched at his elbow, watching the lights of the city flicker below. The room is sparse—a desk covered in documents, a single icon of the Theotokos in the corner, a brazier burning low against the spring chill.\n\n\nHe looks up as you enter. The change in him is visible even now—he sits straighter, his eyes clearer. The haunted, hollow look that marked him when you first arrived has not vanished entirely, but it has receded. He looks like a man who has remembered something important about himself.\n\n\n\"Juan.\" He uses your name, not your title. \"I wondered if you would come.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to a chair across from him. On the desk between you lies a document you recognize—the Constitution of Contributions and Claims, delivered by Chrysoloras's clerk an hour ago. The Emperor's seal already marks the bottom, still warm.\n\n\n\"I have signed your constitution. It is... fair. Fairer than anything my ancestors would have offered.\" He pauses, something complicated moving behind his eyes. \"Fairer than I would have offered, a month ago.\"\n\n\nHe looks out the window again, toward the dark waters of the Horn.\n\n\n\"Tomorrow you sail. Tomorrow evening, Notaras dies.\" His voice is steady, but his hand tightens slightly on the arm of his chair. \"I find myself thinking about the order of those events. That you will not be here to see it. That I must do this thing alone.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to you.\n\n\n\"Is that deliberate?\""

Juan has reassured him about the defenses, explained the desperate cases provision, and asked if there's anything else.\n\nThe Emperor should respond in character - he's changed, grown more confident, but this is still a significant moment. Juan is leaving, and the Emperor must stand on his own for the first time in years. There might be personal matters, practical matters, or simply a moment of connection between these two men who have forged an unlikely partnership.\n\nLet me think about what the Emperor might want to say or ask:\n1. Personal gratitude - but he's already expressed this\n2. Concerns about specific matters - the Patriarch's opposition, the nobles, the Sultan\n3. Something about the execution tomorrow\n4. Something about Juan's family - Lucia, the child\n5. A more personal question or observation\n6. A gift or token\n7. Questions about communication while Juan is away\n\nI should keep this emotionally resonant but not overwrought. The Emperor is a proud man who has just regained his dignity. He won't be effusive.\n\n\nThe Emperor nods slowly at your counsel regarding the desperate cases.\n\n\n\"The widow. The monk. The fisherman with an emperor's name.\" A faint, sad smile crosses his face. \"Yes. I will hear them. There is something... clarifying... about granting mercy because one chooses to, rather than because one is too weak to refuse.\"\n\n\nHe rises from his chair and moves to the window, hands clasped behind his back. For a long moment he is silent, looking out at his city—the domes and towers, the ancient walls, the dark ribbon of water where your fleet rides at anchor.\n\n\n\"My father spent his final years traveling the courts of Europe, begging for help that never came. He visited Paris, London, the German princes. He came home with nothing but promises written on water.\" He turns to face you. \"I swore I would never beg. That I would die here with what dignity remained, rather than humiliate myself as he did.\"\n\n\nHe crosses to a small chest in the corner and opens it. From within, he withdraws something wrapped in purple silk.\n\n\n\"And then you came. A Latin king who gave without demanding. Who armed my enemies' hands against me so that Greeks—not Latins—might free their own Emperor.\" His voice catches slightly. \"You gave me back something I thought I had lost forever. The ability to act. To choose. To be Emperor in truth, not merely in name.\"\n\n\nHe unwraps the silk. Inside is a small reliquary of gold and crystal, no larger than a man's palm. Within it, visible through the crystal, rests a fragment of dark wood.\n\n\n\"A splinter of the True Cross. Brought from Jerusalem by my ancestors after the First Crusade—the real crusade, before the madness of 1204.\" He holds it out to you. \"I know you carry your own relic, given by Pope Martin. But this one comes from me. From Constantinople. From the Empire you are helping to restore.\"\n\n\nHe presses it into your hands.\n\n\n\"When your son is born—and Lucia will give you a son, I am certain of it—tell him this came from the last Roman Emperor who remembered what Rome was meant to be. And that a Castilian king taught that Emperor how to be brave again.\"\n\n\nHe steps back, composing himself. The moment of vulnerability passes, replaced by something more formal—but warmer than the cold protocol of their first meetings.\n\n\n\"Go with God, Defensor. Deliver the tribute to the Sultan if you can arrange your meeting. Win your war in Naples. Return when you are able.\" He pauses. \"I will hold Constantinople until you do. You have my word—and for the first time in many years, my word means something.\"\n\n\nHe extends his hand—not for a formal clasp of alliance, but simply as one man to another.\n\n\n\"Is there anything you would ask of me, before you go?\""

The route would go through the Sea of Marmara, through the Dardanelles, and then south through the Aegean Sea to Rhodes.\n\nFactors to consider:\n- Ottoman naval presence (though there's technically a peace)\n- Weather conditions (May - generally good sailing weather in the Mediterranean)\n- Pirates (always a concern)\n- The fleet composition - how many ships?\n- Lucia is 5.5 months pregnant\n- The letter to the Sultan is being sent\n\nThis is a CHAOS roll - random events, weather, enemy actions.\n\nLet me create a balanced table that reflects the genuine uncertainty of sea travel in this era while not being unreasonably harsh given the circumstances (Ottoman peace still technically holds, good sailing season, competent crew).\n\n\n\nJourney to Rhodes — d100 Table\n\n\nRoute: Constantinople → Sea of Marmara → Dardanelles → Aegean Sea → Rhodes\n\n\nDistance: Approximately 400 nautical miles\n\n\nExpected Duration: 5-7 days with favorable winds\n\n\nFleet Composition:\n\n\nRoyal flagship with Juan, Lucia, Catalina, and household\n\nTransport vessels carrying 200 Military Order soldiers (mixed composition)\n\nSupply ships\n\n\nConditions:\n\n\nSeason: Mid-May (generally favorable sailing weather)\n\nOttoman Peace: Technically still in effect, though strained\n\nLucia: 5½ months pregnant\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nExperienced Castilian sailors and Captain Fernán\n\nGood sailing season\n\nOttoman navy not actively hostile (yet)\n\nWell-supplied fleet\n\nShort voyage through known waters\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nPassage through Dardanelles passes Ottoman-controlled shores\n\nSpring storms still possible in the Aegean\n\nPirates operate in the islands\n\nLucia's pregnancy makes any crisis more dangerous\n\nOttoman patrol galleys may shadow or intercept\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDisaster at Sea — A sudden storm catches the fleet in the open Aegean. Ships scattered, at least one vessel lost with men aboard. The flagship survives but is damaged. Lucia suffers from the violent motion—physicians worried about the pregnancy. Limp into Rhodes days late, depleted and shaken. Loss of 20-40 soldiers and one ship.\n6-10\nOttoman Interception — A squadron of Ottoman war galleys intercepts the fleet near the Dardanelles. Tense standoff—the Ottomans do not attack but shadow the fleet aggressively, counting ships and men. One galley pulls alongside and an Ottoman officer demands to know your business. Humiliating delay and interrogation before being allowed to proceed. News of your exact fleet strength reaches the Sultan.\n11-20\nStorm and Delay — Fierce winds force the fleet to shelter in a bay for two days. No losses, but rough seas leave many soldiers and crew ill. Lucia weathers it but is exhausted. Arrive at Rhodes 3-4 days behind schedule.\n21-30\nPirate Sighting — Corsair sails spotted among the islands. The fleet forms defensive formation and the pirates shadow you for half a day before withdrawing—your numbers too strong for easy prey. No engagement, but nerves frayed and a reminder that these waters are not safe. Minor delay as you take a longer route to avoid ambush points.\n31-40\nMechanical Troubles — One of the transport ships develops a serious leak and must be escorted slowly. The fleet's pace reduced to a crawl for two days while repairs are made at a small island. Soldiers cramped and irritable. Arrive at Rhodes 2 days late but intact.\n41-55\nUneventful Passage — The voyage proceeds without significant incident. Winds are adequate, seas moderate. Lucia rests comfortably in the flagship's cabin. The fleet arrives at Rhodes on schedule, soldiers and crew in good order. The Grand Master's harbor opens to receive you.\n56-70\nSmooth Sailing — Favorable winds speed the fleet south. The Aegean is calm and blue, the May sun warm but not punishing. Lucia enjoys time on deck watching the islands pass. Soldiers maintain discipline and arrive at Rhodes in good spirits, a day ahead of schedule.\n71-80\nOttoman Courtesy — As the fleet passes the Dardanelles, an Ottoman patrol galley approaches under flag of parley. The captain delivers a formal message: the Sultan has received your letter and is considering your proposal. No threats, no delays—professional naval courtesy between powers not yet at war. The encounter suggests Murad is taking your offer seriously.\n81-90\nProvidential Winds — Exceptional sailing conditions—steady winds from the north, calm seas, clear skies. The fleet makes remarkable time, arriving at Rhodes two days early. Soldiers well-rested, Lucia refreshed by the sea air. The Grand Master, surprised by your early arrival, scrambles to prepare a proper reception.\n91-95\nRescue at Sea — The fleet encounters a Greek fishing vessel in distress, swamped and sinking. Your sailors rescue the crew—a family from one of the islands, fleeing Ottoman tax collectors. Their gratitude is boundless; word of the rescue spreads quickly. When you arrive at Rhodes, the story has already preceded you. The Hospitaller knights speak of it approvingly—a king who stops for fishermen.\n96-100\nThe Sultan's Reply — As the fleet approaches Rhodes, a swift Ottoman courier vessel intercepts under flag of truce. It carries a formal reply from Sultan Murad II himself, responding to your letter. The Sultan agrees to a meeting—the tribute delivery at a location to be determined, with guarantees of safe conduct for both parties. He writes that he too values understanding between rulers, and that he has read your questions about faith with interest. The diplomatic breakthrough you hoped for, delivered before you even reach port.\n\n\nShall I roll, or do you wish to?"

Days lost to rescue and repairs. Limp into Rhodes badly delayed, one carrack possibly lost or requiring major repairs. Loss of 15-30 soldiers.\n6-10\nOttoman Interception — A squadron of Ottoman war galleys intercepts the convoy in the Dardanelles narrows. Four carracks cannot outrun or outfight galleys in confined waters. Tense standoff—the Ottomans do not attack but force the fleet to heave to. An Ottoman officer boards the flagship and demands to inspect the cargo and passenger manifest. Humiliating search before being allowed to proceed. Detailed intelligence on your movements reaches the Sultan.\n11-20\nStorm and Delay — Strong winds and heavy seas force the fleet to shelter in a protected bay for two days. The carracks ride it out well—they are built for rough water—but the delay is frustrating. Lucia weathers the storm but is exhausted and confined to her cabin. Arrive at Rhodes 3-4 days behind schedule, supplies diminished.\n21-30\nPirate Sighting — Corsair sails spotted among the islands—three or four light galleys probing the convoy's strength. Carracks are tempting prey: slow, rich, and without galley escort. Captain Fernán orders defensive formation, crossbowmen to the rails. The pirates shadow you for hours before withdrawing—four armed carracks with soldiers visible on deck are more than they bargained for. No engagement, but a tense day and a longer route to avoid known pirate waters. Minor delay.\n31-40\nContrary Winds — The wind shifts against you, forcing the carracks to tack laboriously through the Aegean. What should take five days stretches to eight or nine. Soldiers grow restless in cramped quarters. Supplies adequate but morale low. Lucia tired of confinement. Arrive at Rhodes late, everyone eager to disembark.\n41-55\nUneventful Passage — The voyage proceeds without significant incident. Winds are adequate, seas moderate. The carracks make steady progress through the Dardanelles and into the Aegean. Lucia rests comfortably in the flagship's cabin. The fleet arrives at Rhodes on schedule, soldiers and crew in good order. The Grand Master's harbor opens to receive you.\n56-70\nSmooth Sailing — Favorable winds fill the sails and speed the convoy south. The Aegean is calm and blue, the May sun warm but not punishing. Lucia enjoys time on deck watching the islands pass, Catalina delighted by the seabirds. Soldiers maintain discipline and good spirits. Arrive at Rhodes a day ahead of schedule in good order.\n71-80\nOttoman Courtesy — As the convoy passes the Dardanelles, an Ottoman patrol galley approaches under flag of parley. The captain delivers a formal message: the Sultan has received your letter and is considering your proposal. He offers no obstruction to your passage and wishes you fair winds. Professional naval courtesy between powers not yet at war. The encounter suggests Murad takes your offer of dialogue seriously.\n81-90\nExcellent Passage — Exceptional sailing conditions—steady winds from the north, calm seas, clear skies. Captain Fernán remarks he has rarely seen better weather for the crossing. The fleet makes remarkable time, arriving at Rhodes two days early. Soldiers well-rested, Lucia refreshed by the sea air and gentle motion. Time to rest before the next leg of the journey.\n91-95\nRescue and Reputation — The convoy encounters a Greek merchant vessel taking on water, her crew struggling to keep her afloat. Your sailors assist in the rescue, transferring cargo and passengers before she sinks. The Greek captain is a trader from Rhodes itself—he promises to speak of Castilian honor throughout the island. When you arrive at Rhodes, the story has preceded you. The Hospitaller knights approve—a king who stops for those in need.\n96-100\nThe Sultan's Reply — As the convoy approaches Rhodes, a swift Ottoman courier vessel intercepts under flag of truce. It carries a formal reply from Sultan Murad II himself, responding to your letter. The Sultan agrees to meet—the tribute delivery provides a suitable occasion, at a location offering security for both parties.

Winds are adequate, seas moderate. The carracks make steady progress through the Dardanelles and into the Aegean. Lucia rests comfortably in the flagship's cabin. The fleet arrives at Rhodes on schedule, soldiers and crew in good order. The Grand Master's harbor opens to receive you.\n\nI should narrate this passage briefly and then set the scene for arrival at Rhodes.\n\n\n\nThe Passage to Rhodes\n\n\nMay 16-22, 1434\n\n\n\nThe four carracks slip their moorings at dawn, the walls of Constantinople receding into the morning haze behind you. Lucia stands at the stern rail for a long while, watching until the dome of Hagia Sophia is swallowed by distance. Catalina, nearly two years old now, waves at the seagulls circling the masts.\n\n\nThe passage through the Sea of Marmara is uneventful. Ottoman fishing boats give the convoy wide berth; a single patrol galley observes from a distance near the Dardanelles but makes no move to intercept. Captain Fernán keeps the carracks in tight formation through the narrows, crossbowmen visible on deck—a quiet show of readiness that discourages any provocation.\n\n\nThe Aegean opens before you, island-dotted and blue. The winds are adequate if not exceptional, filling the sails and pushing the heavy carracks steadily southward. You pass Lesbos, Chios, the scattered Cyclades—some Venetian-held, some under Ottoman shadow, some contested by pirates and petty lords.\n\n\nLucia spends most days in the flagship's great cabin, resting. The physicians report the pregnancy progresses normally; the child is active, kicking strongly. She emerges in the evenings to take air on deck, leaning against you as the sun sets over the western islands.\n\n\nThe soldiers maintain discipline. Two hundred men on four ships is crowded but manageable. They drill with crossbows when seas permit, maintain their equipment, attend daily Mass conducted by the fleet's chaplain.\n\n\nOn the sixth day, the mountainous bulk of Rhodes rises from the sea.\n\n\n\nRhodes — May 22, 1434\n\n\nThe harbor of Rhodes is one of the great fortified anchorages of the Mediterranean. The Knights of Saint John have held this island for over a century, transforming it into a fortress-state that guards the eastern sea lanes against Ottoman and Mamluk alike. Their banner—the white cross on red—flies from every tower.\n\n\nAs the convoy approaches, signal flags break out from the harbor castle. A Hospitaller galley rows out to meet you, its captain calling across the water in accented Castilian.\n\n\n\"His Most Eminent Highness the Grand Master bids King Juan of Castile welcome to Rhodes! You are expected. Pilots will guide you to anchorage.\"\n\n\nThe harbor opens before you—a forest of masts, galleys and round ships, Venetian traders and Hospitaller warships. The Palace of the Grand Master dominates the hill above the town, its towers flying the Order's colors.\n\n\nAs the flagship is warped to the quay, you see a delegation forming on the dock. Knights in black mantles with white crosses. Servants. A canopy against the Mediterranean sun.\n\n\nAnd at their head, a tall figure in the robes of his office: Jean de Lastic, Grand Master of the Knights of Saint John, come personally to greet you.\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

I need to think carefully about what the Grand Master of the Knights of Saint John would want, what his concerns would be, and how he would realistically react to Juan's offer.\n\nLet me think about Jean de Lastic and the Knights of Saint John (Hospitallers):\n\n**Who is Jean de Lastic?**\n- Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller (Knights of Saint John)\n- He became Grand Master in 1437 historically, but in this alternate timeline it seems he's already Grand Master in 1434\n- Actually, let me reconsider - historically, Antoni de Fluvià was Grand Master from 1421-1437, then Jean de Lastic from 1437-1454. But this is an alternate history, so the GM may have placed de Lastic earlier. I should go with what's established.\n\n**What do the Hospitallers want?**\n1. Survival of their Order and their base on Rhodes\n2. To continue their mission of defending Christendom against Islam\n3. Wealth and donations from Christian Europe\n4. Recognition and prestige\n5. Potentially, recovery of their lost properties in the Holy Land and elsewhere\n6. Defense against Ottoman expansion (Rhodes is vulnerable)\n\n**What are their concerns about Juan's offer?**\n1. The Hospitallers already claim properties in Constantinople (mentioned in the chapter summaries - a Hospitaller commander on Rhodes claiming his Order's ancient properties in Constantinople itself)\n2. They might see Juan as a rival for crusading prestige\n3. They might worry about being subordinated to a secular king\n4. They might be skeptical of the Byzantine alliance given the Great Schism\n5. They have their own relationships with Venice, Genoa, and other powers\n6. They need to maintain their independence as a sovereign military order\n\n**Success Factors for Juan:**\n- Juan has actually accomplished something (Reconquista, Constantinople defense)\n- He's offering concrete opportunities\n\n\n- The Hospitallers need allies against the Ottomans\n- Juan's reputation as a genuine crusader precedes him\n- He's speaking French (showing respect for the Order's Frankish heritage)\n- He's not demanding anything yet, just opening discussion\n\nThe Order sees potential strategic value in Juan's approach. They recognize his military credentials and appreciate his diplomatic sensitivity. While cautious, they're intrigued by a potential alliance that could strengthen their position against Ottoman threats. The fact that Juan speaks their language and approaches with respect increases the likelihood of a favorable initial reception.\n\n\nI need to consider carefully who Jean de Lastic is and what the Hospitallers want.\n\n\n\nJean de Lastic, Grand Master of the Knights of Saint John\n\n\nBackground:\n\n\nFrench nobleman, career Hospitaller\n\nGrand Master of a sovereign military order answering only to the Pope\n\nCommands the most formidable Christian naval force in the eastern Mediterranean\n\nRhodes has been the Order's base since 1310 after losing the Holy Land\n\nThe Order is wealthy, proud, and fiercely independent\n\n\nWhat does he want?\n\n\nSurvival of Rhodes against Ottoman expansion\n\nContinued flow of donations and recruits from Christian Europe\n\nRecovery of Order properties lost over the centuries (including in Constantinople)\n\nRecognition of the Order's primacy in eastern Mediterranean crusading\n\nAllies against the Ottomans—but not masters\n\n\nWhat won't he say?\n\n\nThe Order's finances are strained by constant military readiness\n\nHe fears Rhodes may eventually fall without major support\n\nHe resents secular kings claiming crusading glory while the Hospitallers do the actual fighting year after year\n\nHe has heard of Juan's \"Constitution of Contributions and Claims\" and worries it may void Hospitaller claims in Constantinople\n\n\nWhat has he seen/heard?\n\n\nReports of Juan's Reconquista—impressive, but far away\n\nNews from Constantinople—the Apokatastasis, the decrees, the Notaras arrest\n\nThe Hospitaller commander's petition for Order properties in Constantinople was among those claims\n\nJuan's letter to the Sultan (word travels fast in these waters)\n\n\nHis concerns about Juan:\n\n\nA Latin king declaring himself \"Defensor Romaniae\" could be seen as overreach\n\nThe Order has defended Eastern Christendom for centuries—who is this Castilian to arrive and reorganize everything?\n\nIf Latin properties in Constantinople require \"contribution\" to be valid, what of Hospitaller claims that predate 1204?\n\nIs Juan an ally, a rival, or a would-be overlord?\n\n\n\nJean de Lastic's Reaction — d100 Table\n\n\nJuan's Approach: Direct announcement of title and achievements, invitation to discuss the Order's place in the new arrangement. Spoken in fluent French (respectful of the Order's heritage).\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nJuan has genuine accomplishments (Reconquista completed, Constantinople defended)\n\nHe speaks French fluently—shows respect\n\nThe Hospitallers desperately need allies against the Ottomans\n\nJuan is opening discussion, not issuing demands\n\nHis reputation as a sincere crusader precedes him\n\nHe has Military Order experience from Castile\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nThe Order is sovereign—they don't \"find their place\" in anyone's arrangement\n\nDe Lastic may view Juan as a newcomer presuming to lead in the Order's sphere\n\nThe Constitution of Contributions threatens Hospitaller property claims\n\nJuan's directness may come across as arrogance to a man who has spent decades earning his position\n\nThe Order has complex internal politics—de Lastic cannot commit without his council\n\n\"Defensor Romaniae\" is a grand title; de Lastic has heard grand titles before from men who accomplished little\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nCold Reception — De Lastic's expression freezes. \"Defensor Romaniae. A grand title, Your Majesty. The Order has defended Romania for two centuries without requiring a Castilian to lead us.\" He is polite but icy. He has heard about the Constitution of Contributions and believes it threatens Hospitaller claims. He offers minimal hospitality and makes clear Juan is a guest, not a partner. Any negotiation will be uphill.\n11-20\nPolite Skepticism — De Lastic listens, nods, offers formal welcome. But his questions are pointed: \"And what place do you envision for an Order that answers only to the Holy Father? We do not serve secular kings, however worthy.\" He is testing Juan, probing for signs of overreach. He will hear proposals but commits to nothing. The Order's council must be consulted. Hospitaller claims in Constantinople are raised immediately as a concern.\n21-35\nCautious Interest — De Lastic raises an eyebrow at the title but does not dismiss it. \"You have accomplished much, King Juan. The Reconquista, now Constantinople. The Order takes note.\" He invites Juan to dine and discuss further, but makes clear the Hospitallers have their own interests. He asks directly about the Constitution of Contributions—does it apply to the Order's ancient claims? A negotiation, not an alliance, begins.\n36-50\nProfessional Respect — De Lastic grips Juan's hand firmly. \"We have followed your progress with interest, Your Majesty. A king who actually crusades, rather than merely talking of it—this is rare.\" He welcomes Juan warmly but formally. He is willing to discuss cooperation but emphasizes the Order's sovereignty and independent mission. He wants to know specifics: What does Juan actually propose? What would the Order gain? What would be expected? Serious conversation ahead.\n51-65\nGenuine Welcome — De Lastic's weathered face creases into a smile. \"Defensor Romaniae! I wondered how long before someone claimed that title. I am glad it is a man who has earned it.\" He embraces Juan in the French manner and personally escorts him to the Palace. He is eager to discuss cooperation—Rhodes feels increasingly isolated, and a strong ally in Constantinople changes the strategic picture. He has concerns about specific arrangements but approaches them as problems to solve, not obstacles to raise.\n66-80\nEnthusiastic Reception — \"Your Majesty, you are most welcome. Most welcome indeed.\" De Lastic's greeting is warm and immediate. He has been hoping for exactly this—a Christian king with resources and will, committed to the eastern Mediterranean. He speaks frankly: Rhodes cannot hold forever alone; the Order needs partners. He proposes immediate strategic discussions and offers Hospitaller naval support for Juan's endeavors. Hospitaller claims in Constantinople are raised but in a spirit of finding solutions.\n81-90\nStrategic Alignment — De Lastic takes Juan's arm like an old comrade. \"King Juan, God has sent you to us at the hour of need. Come—we have much to discuss.\" He reveals that the Order has been preparing contingency plans for exactly this scenario: a Christian counteroffensive in the East. He has maps, intelligence on Ottoman naval strength, assessments of defensible positions. He sees Juan as the secular sword the Order has been waiting for, and himself as the shield that can protect Juan's flank. Immediate and substantive partnership offered.\n91-100\nA Meeting of Minds — De Lastic stares at Juan for a long moment, then laughs—a genuine, relieved sound. \"Do you know how long I have prayed for this? A Christian king who does not merely speak of crusade while emptying our coffers for his wars at home?\" He waves aside protocol and walks with Juan along the harbor, speaking freely. He offers the Order's full cooperation: naval support, intelligence, coordination against the Ottomans. He also offers something unexpected—a proposal that Hospitaller knights serve alongside Castilian forces in Constantinople, integrating the Order into Juan's defensive structure. \"Rhodes alone cannot hold. Constantinople alone cannot hold. But together?\" The Order's claims in Constantinople can be resolved as part of a broader partnership.\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

I write to the King of France, the Duke of Burgundy, the Doge of Venice.\" His voice is tired, bitter beneath the warmth. \"I explain that Rhodes is the shield of Christendom.

That the Holy Land can never be recovered if the stepping stones are lost.\"\n\n\nHe stops, looking out at the harbor where your carracks ride at anchor beside Hospitaller galleys.\n\n\n\"And they write back with sympathy. With prayers. With promises of support when circumstances permit.\" He spits the last words. \"Circumstances never permit. There is always a war in France, a rebellion in Germany, a succession crisis somewhere. Christendom bleeds itself white fighting over scraps while the Turk grows stronger every year.\"\n\n\nHe turns to face you directly. His eyes are sharp, assessing—the eyes of a man who has commanded warriors and weighed souls for decades.\n\n\n\"And then you arrive. A king who actually crusades, rather than merely talking of it. Who completed the Reconquista in two years—a feat men said would take a generation. Who sailed to Constantinople with knights and gold when everyone else sent excuses. Who is named Defensor Romaniae not by his own proclamation but by the Emperor himself.\"\n\n\nHe grips your shoulder.\n\n\n\"King Juan, God has sent you to us at the hour of need. I believe this. I am not a man given to easy faith in princes—I have been disappointed too many times. But what you have done... what you are doing...\"\n\n\nHe releases you and gestures toward the Palace of the Grand Master, rising above the town.\n\n\n\"Come. I have maps. Intelligence reports on Ottoman naval strength. Assessments of every defensible position from here to Constantinople.

I come to you as one soldier to another, asking: How can the Order serve this cause? How can we work together?\"\n\n\n\"Rhodes alone cannot hold forever. Constantinople alone cannot hold. But together—the Order's ships, your soldiers, Byzantine walls, Castilian gold—together we might do something that has not been done in two hundred years.\"\n\n\nHe pauses at the base of the stairs leading up to the palace.\n\n\n\"I would propose this: Hospitaller knights serving alongside your forces in Constantinople. Not as mercenaries, not as guests, but as brothers in arms, integrated into the defense. We have experience fighting the Turk that no one else possesses. We know their tactics, their weaknesses, their patterns. And in return...\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"In return, we ask only to be part of what you are building. To have a place in the restoration of Christian power in the East. Our claims in Constantinople can be resolved as part of that partnership—contribution for titles, as your Constitution demands.

I should research what the Knights of Saint John actually had available in 1434 to give a historically accurate picture.\n\nLet me think about what the Hospitallers would have had around this time:\n\n1. Knights of Saint John on Rhodes (1434):\n- The Order had been on Rhodes since 1310\n- They were a significant naval power in the eastern Mediterranean\n- Their strength varied, but they typically had several hundred knights plus sergeants and auxiliary troops\n- They had a substantial galley fleet\n\nI should have de Lastic give a realistic assessment of their forces - neither too grand nor too modest. He should be honest about limitations as well as strengths.\n\nLet me think about the numbers:\n- Knights: Perhaps 300-500 on Rhodes at any given time\n- Sergeants and men-at-arms: Perhaps 500-1000 more\n- Galleys: Maybe 6-10 war galleys\n- They also had fortifications on Rhodes and other islands\n- They recruited from across Europe, with \"Langues\" (tongues) representing different nations\n\nDe Lastic should be practical and military-minded in his assessment. He should discuss what he CAN send vs what he needs to keep for Rhodes's defense.\n\n\nDe Lastic's face breaks into a genuine smile as you grip his shoulder. For a moment, the weight of years seems to lift from him.\n\n\n\"Apokatastasis.\" He rolls the Greek word carefully. \"Yes. Restoration. The Orthodox have their word, we have ours. But blood spilled for Christ is the same color in any language.\"\n\n\nHe guides you up the stairs and into the Palace of the Grand Master—a fortress within a fortress, its halls hung with the banners of the Order's eight Langues, the national divisions that make up the Hospitaller brotherhood.\n\n\nIn a high-ceilinged chamber overlooking the harbor, he spreads maps across a great table and calls for wine. Servants withdraw; knights take positions at the doors. This is now a council of war.\n\n\n\"Our strength.\" De Lastic traces the outline of Rhodes on the map. \"Let me be honest with you, King Juan, as I would want you to be honest with me.\"\n\n\n\nThe Order's Military Strength\n\n\nKnights:\n\n\n\"We have approximately three hundred knights currently on Rhodes. Brothers of the Order, fully professed, trained from youth in war.\" He taps the table. \"These are not peasant levies or hired swords. Each one is worth five ordinary soldiers—perhaps ten, against enemies who do not know how we fight.\"\n\n\n\"Of these, perhaps one hundred fifty can be spared for operations beyond Rhodes at any given time. The rest must remain to garrison the island, man our galleys, and maintain readiness. If I strip Rhodes bare, I invite the Sultan to take it.\"\n\n\nSergeants and Men-at-Arms:\n\n\n\"Beyond the knights, we have five hundred sergeants—men who have taken vows but are not of noble birth. They serve as heavy infantry, crossbowmen, galley officers. Good soldiers, reliable.\"\n\n\n\"And another three hundred hired men-at-arms—Greeks, Italians, some Catalans. Professionals who fight for pay but have served the Order long enough to be trusted.\"\n\n\n\"In total, on land: eleven hundred fighting men, of whom perhaps five to six hundred could deploy while maintaining Rhodes's security.\"\n\n\n\nNaval Strength:\n\n\nDe Lastic moves to a second map—the eastern Mediterranean, with Ottoman and Christian positions marked.\n\n\n\"This is where our true power lies.\"\n\n\n\"The Order maintains eight war galleys at full readiness. Fast, well-armed, crewed by experienced mariners and marines. Each carries forty to fifty fighting men beyond the rowers.\"\n\n\nHe traces sea routes with his finger.\n\n\n\"We also have four great carracks for transport and supply—similar to your own vessels. And a dozen smaller craft: dispatch boats, coastal raiders, supply runners.\"\n\n\n\"Our galleys are the finest in these waters. Venetian ships are more numerous; Genoese ships are comparable; Ottoman galleys are many but often poorly crewed. Ship for ship, man for man, we are the best sailors between here and Gibraltar.\"\n\n\n\"The problem is numbers. Eight galleys cannot control the Aegean. They can raid, patrol, intercept—but they cannot blockade the Dardanelles or contest Ottoman naval supremacy in open battle.\"\n\n\n\nStrategic Position:\n\n\n\"Rhodes itself is the key.\" He taps the island. \"We sit astride the sea lanes from Constantinople to Egypt, from the Aegean to Cyprus. Any Ottoman fleet sailing south must pass within sight of our walls. Any Christian ship sailing east knows Rhodes is a safe harbor.\"\n\n\n\"We hold Kos and several smaller islands as well. Outposts, early warning stations. When the Ottoman fleet moves, we know within days.\"\n\n\n\"Our intelligence network extends throughout the Ottoman lands. Greek merchants, renegade Turks, captives we have ransomed—they all bring us information. I can tell you the names of the Sultan's admirals, the number of galleys in his dockyards, the state of his treasury.\"\n\n\n\nDe Lastic sets down his wine cup and looks at you directly.\n\n\n\"So. What can the Order contribute to your apokatastasis?\"\n\n\n\"Fifty knights and one hundred sergeants to Constantinople immediately—men who can train your Greeks, stiffen the wall garrison, provide expertise against Ottoman siege tactics. They would serve under your command as Defensor, integrated into the defense as I proposed.\"\n\n\n\"Two war galleys stationed at Constantinople to patrol the approaches, protect supply ships, and provide early warning of Ottoman naval movements. More in times of crisis, if Rhodes is not directly threatened.\"\n\n\n\"Full intelligence sharing. Everything we learn about Ottoman movements, you will know. And I would ask the same in return.\"\n\n\n\"Naval coordination. When you move against the Turk—and you will, eventually—our galleys operate alongside yours. A combined fleet of Castilian, Byzantine, and Hospitaller ships would be the most formidable Christian force these waters have seen in generations.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"In return, I ask three things.\"\n\n\n\"First: Recognition of the Order's sovereignty. We are not vassals, not subjects. We serve the Pope and our own Grand Master. We fight beside you as allies, not under you as subordinates.\"\n\n\n\"Second: A voice in strategic councils. When decisions are made about the defense of Constantinople or operations against the Ottomans, the Order has a seat at the table.\"\n\n\n\"Third: The Order's claims in Constantinople resolved fairly. Our ancient properties—the hospital, the commandery, the church of Saint John. I do not demand them as rights; I ask that we be allowed to earn them through contribution, as your Constitution provides. Fifty knights and a hundred sergeants and two galleys... surely that merits a hospital and a church?\"\n\n\nHe extends his hand.\n\n\n\"These are my terms, King Juan. What say you?\""

Juan doesn't want to promise something that would dispossess current Greek occupants - that would undermine the goodwill he's built with the Byzantines and contradict the spirit of the Constitution of Contributions.\n\nI need to think about what properties the Hospitallers might have historically held in Constantinople:\n\n1. The Knights Hospitaller were founded in Jerusalem around 1099, originally as a hospital for pilgrims\n2. They had properties throughout Christendom, including in Constantinople\n3. After 1204 (the Fourth Crusade), Latin religious orders would have gained properties in Constantinople\n4. After 1261 when the Byzantines reclaimed the city, many Latin properties were confiscated or fell into disuse\n5. By 1434, the city's population has declined dramatically - Constantinople is a shadow of its former self\n\nSo the question is: what happened to Hospitaller properties after 1261? Were they:\n- Confiscated and given to Greeks?\n- Abandoned and now ruined?\n- Still technically claimed but unused?\n- Converted to other purposes?\n\nGiven the depopulation of Constantinople by 1434 (the city that once held 400,000+ people now has perhaps 50,000), many properties would be abandoned or ruined. But some might have been taken over by Greek institutions or families.\n\nLet me have de Lastic list the properties and describe their current status as best he knows it. This creates an opportunity for negotiation and shows Juan being careful not to dispossess Greeks.\n\n\nDe Lastic nods, appreciating the practical turn of the conversation. He calls for a clerk, who brings a leather folder containing old documents—property records, some dating back two centuries.\n\n\n\"We have maintained records, of course. Hope dies hard in the Order.\" A wry smile. \"Let me show you what we claim.\"\n\n\nHe spreads the documents on the table.\n\n\n\nHospitaller Properties in Constantinople (Claimed)\n\n\n1. The Hospital of Saint John the Almsgiver\n\n\n\"Our original foundation in the city. Near the harbor, in the Genoese quarter—or what was the Genoese quarter before the divisions became... complicated.\"\n\n\nDe Lastic's information: \"Built in the 1130s, expanded after 1204. A proper hospital—beds for pilgrims, an infirmary, a chapel attached. We lost it after the Greeks returned in 1261. My information, which is perhaps fifteen years old, suggests the building still stands but has been...\"\n\n\nHe hesitates. \"...repurposed. A Greek merchant family—the name escapes me—was using part of it as a warehouse. The chapel may still function as a church, but Orthodox, not Latin.\"\n\n\n\n2. The Commandery of Saint John\n\n\n\"Our administrative headquarters. Near the Blachernae, actually—a fortified house where the Order's commander in Constantinople resided, with quarters for visiting knights, stables, a small armory.\"\n\n\nDe Lastic's information: \"This one I am less certain about. After 1261, it was confiscated by the Emperor. It may have been granted to a Greek noble family, or it may have fallen into ruin. Constantinople has many empty buildings now, I am told.\"\n\n\n\n3. The Church of Saint John the Baptist\n\n\n\"A chapel we built adjacent to the hospital. Small but beautiful—Italian craftsmen did the mosaics.\"\n\n\nDe Lastic's information: \"Almost certainly converted to Orthodox use after 1261. If it still stands, it will have been reconsecrated. I would not dream of demanding Greeks vacate a functioning church. But if we are to have a presence in Constantinople again, we would need somewhere to worship in the Latin rite.\"\n\n\n\n4. Income Properties\n\n\n\"Several houses and shops that generated rent to support the hospital's charitable work. Scattered through the city.\"\n\n\nDe Lastic's information: \"These I cannot account for. After one hundred seventy years? They have been sold, seized, demolished, or occupied by whoever found them empty. I make no claim to these. They are ghosts.\"\n\n\n\nDe Lastic sets down the documents and meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"So. In honesty? I claim four things, of which two may be ruins, one is likely occupied by Greeks, and one has certainly been converted to Orthodox worship.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"I am not a fool, King Juan. I know the Order cannot simply walk back into Constantinople and demand buildings that others have used for generations. That would make enemies of the very people you are trying to rally.\"\n\n\n\"What I need is not these specific buildings. What I need is a presence. A hospital where Hospitaller brothers can do the work God called us to do—caring for the sick, sheltering pilgrims. A chapel where we can worship. Quarters for the knights I send to serve the defense.\"\n\n\n\"If the old properties are available and unoccupied—wonderful. If they are occupied by Greeks who have legitimate claim—then we find alternatives. Constantinople has empty buildings enough, I am told. The Order can restore a ruin as easily as reclaim an inheritance.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\n\"What matters is that the Order has a recognized place in the restored city. A foothold from which to contribute to the apokatastasis. The specific stones and timbers... these are negotiable.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say?"

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed diplomatic offer, weighed sovereignty concerns against strategic opportunity.\n\nJuan is responding to de Lastic's three requests:\n\n1. Recognition of the Order's sovereignty - Juan is saying they'll be treated like other contributors (Venetians, Pisans), subject to city laws including \"everyone fights\" but not directly commanded. This is a nuanced response - not full sovereignty but also not subordination.\n\n2. A voice in strategic councils - Juan says he consults major contributors of skill, and command is based on merit. He expects Hospitallers will earn command positions.\n\n3. The Order's claims in Constantinople - Juan says there will be space, they can have a commandery, churches, and can accumulate contribution toward titles/lands.\n\nDe Lastic needs to react to this. Let me think about what he's hearing:\n\nPositive:\n- Welcome with open arms\n- Similar arrangements to Castilian forces (900 men have quarter)\n- Will have a commandery\n- Churches granted\n- Can participate in the contribution system for titles/lands\n- Merit-based command means skilled Hospitallers will likely get positions\n- Juan consults major contributors\n\nConcerns:\n- \"Treated like anyone else\" - the Order is used to being special, sovereign\n- \"Subject to the laws of the city\" - this is a limitation on sovereignty\n- \"No one commands you directly BUT...\" - there's a but\n- \"Everyone fights\" - not a problem, but it's framed as a requirement, not a choice\n- Juan is asking for 500 men - that's more than de Lastic offered (150 knights + 100 sergeants = 250)\n\nDe Lastic offered:\n- 50 knights and 100 sergeants to Constantinople immediately\n- 2 war galleys stationed there\n\nJuan is now suggesting 500 men. That's double what de Lastic offered and would strip Rhodes dangerously thin.\n\nDe Lastic said he has:\n- 300 knights (150 can be spared)\n- 500 sergeants\n- 300 hired men-at-arms\n\n\n- Total 1,100 fighting men, of which 500-600 could deploy\n\nThe proposed 500-man deployment represents a critical strategic calculation. Juan's request pushes the absolute limits of the Order's military capacity, potentially compromising Rhodes's defensive posture. De Lactic must carefully weigh the diplomatic opportunity against the potential vulnerability this commitment would create. The sovereignty issue remains delicate - Juan's diplomatic language suggests inclusion while subtly maintaining city authority, which could challenge the Order's traditional autonomy.\n\nI'll craft a nuanced response that acknowledges the strategic potential while protecting the Order's core interests. Diplomatic precision will be essential in this negotiation.\n\n\nDe Lastic listens carefully, nodding along. When you mention the contribution system and the value of mounted knights, he produces a wax tablet and begins scratching calculations—a commander's habit, translating men into strategic weight.\n\n\nBut when you finish, he holds up a hand, his expression thoughtful rather than troubled.\n\n\n\"Five hundred men.\" He sets down the tablet. \"You ask for double what I offered, Your Majesty. Let me be clear about what that means for the Order.\"\n\n\nHe gestures at the map of Rhodes.\n\n\n\"I told you I have eleven hundred fighting men. Of those, five to six hundred can deploy while maintaining Rhodes's security. If I send five hundred to Constantinople, I send everything I can spare. Every man. Rhodes becomes a skeleton garrison, dependent on walls and prayers.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, considering.\n\n\n\"I do not say no. But I need to understand: is this a permanent garrison you envision, or a response to immediate crisis? Five hundred men I can send for a campaign, a season, a specific operation. Five hundred men indefinitely stationed in Constantinople... that leaves Rhodes naked if the Sultan turns his attention south.\"\n\n\nHe strokes his beard.\n\n\n\"What I proposed—fifty knights, one hundred sergeants, two galleys—that I can sustain permanently. A standing Hospitaller presence in Constantinople, year after year, without crippling Rhodes. For a major campaign against the Ottomans, when the time comes? Then yes, we commit everything. The Order sails to war at full strength.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"Do you see the distinction? I would give you one hundred fifty men forever, or five hundred men for a season. But not five hundred men forever—that I cannot do without abandoning our own walls.\"\n\n\n\nOn the matter of sovereignty, he nods slowly.\n\n\n\"Subject to the laws of the city. 'Everyone fights.'\" A faint smile. \"The Order has no quarrel with fighting, Your Majesty. That is what we exist to do. And I understand that in Constantinople, there must be one command structure, one set of laws. I do not ask for Hospitaller knights to stand above the law or outside the chain of command in battle.\"\n\n\nHe chooses his next words carefully.\n\n\n\"What I ask is this: the Order's internal affairs remain our own. We discipline our own brothers according to our Rule. We elect our own officers. We answer to the Pope in spiritual matters, and to ourselves in matters of our governance. In the field, under your command or the Emperor's, we fight as part of the whole. In our commandery, we live as Hospitallers.\"\n\n\nHe extends his hand again.\n\n\n\"Is this acceptable? One hundred fifty men as a permanent garrison, contributing to your muster, earning titles through blood as your Constitution demands. And the full strength of the Order—five hundred, six hundred, every man who can hold a sword—when the day comes to take the war to the Turk.\"\n\n\n\"And in return: a commandery, a chapel, a hospital. A voice in your councils. Recognition that the Knights of Saint John are allies, not subjects.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say?"

You will be given command to most probably command forces beyond those of the order, but this will always be done at my best judgement. I cannot imagine how your internal discipline will conflict with the existing civil laws of the city.\n\n\nI will order 2000 florins to be released from the treasury to help you purchase and restore properties in the city outside of the latin quarters.

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed diplomatic concessions and predicted favorable acceptance.\n\nJuan is being very diplomatic here. He's:\n1. Accepting the 150 men and 2 galleys as a reasonable permanent contribution\n2. Not making promises he can't keep about properties\n3. Offering 2000 florins to help the Order establish themselves fresh, rather than reclaiming old properties\n4. Explicitly asking the Order to not bring up old claims from before 1204\n5. Framing this as a fresh start for Greek-Hospitaller relations\n\nThis is a wise approach. De Lastic proposed reasonable terms, and Juan is meeting him halfway while being clear about the political realities - that the Greeks have long memories of 1204 and the Order's original acquisition of properties during that period.\n\nNow I need to figure out how de Lastic reacts. Given the previous roll of 92 (very positive), de Lastic should be receptive. But he's also a proud man leading a sovereign order. Let me think about what he would accept and what might give him pause.\n\nThe 2000 florins is generous - that's a substantial sum that could purchase and restore a commandery, chapel, and hospital. The ask to not mention old claims is reasonable given the political situation.\n\nDe Lastic is a pragmatist. He said himself that he's not a fool and knows the Order can't just demand buildings others have used for generations. Juan's offer actually gives him what he needs (a presence in Constantinople) without the political baggage of reclaiming \"stolen\" property.\n\nI think de Lastic would accept this gratefully, perhaps with a moment of reflection on what it means to let go of old claims. This is a man who has dealt with disappointment from Christian princes for decades - Juan's straightforward, honest approach is refreshing to him.\n\nI don't think I need a dice roll here - the previous roll of 92 established a very positive dynamic, and Juan's offer is fair and reasonable. De Lastic should accept.\n\n\nDe Lastic is silent for a long moment. His hand remains extended, but his eyes have gone distant, calculating not numbers now but something deeper—pride, history, the weight of two centuries.\n\n\nThen, slowly, he withdraws his hand. Not in rejection, but in contemplation.\n\n\n\"You ask me to renounce claims that predate my grandfather's grandfather.\" His voice is quiet, measured. \"Properties the Order held when Constantinople was the greatest city in Christendom. Before the disaster. Before everything.\"\n\n\nHe walks to the window, looking out at the harbor where Hospitaller galleys ride at anchor beside your carracks.\n\n\n\"Do you know what the Greeks call us, King Juan? When they think we are not listening?\" He doesn't wait for an answer. \"They call us frankoi. Franks. The same word they use for the men who burned their city, stole their relics, placed a prostitute on the Patriarch's throne. To them, every Latin is a Frank, and every Frank carries the guilt of 1204.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to face you.\n\n\n\"I was not there. My Order was not responsible—we held the Holy Land while others sacked Constantinople. But does that matter to a Greek whose grandmother told him stories of Latin soldiers murdering Orthodox priests?\" He shakes his head. \"No. We are all Franks to them.\"\n\n\nA long pause.\n\n\n\"Two thousand florins.\" He weighs the words. \"A fresh start. New properties, purchased fairly, built with our own hands. No ghosts. No old wounds reopened.\"\n\n\nHe crosses back to the table and pours himself more wine. Takes a long drink.\n\n\n\"You are wiser than your years, King Juan. Or perhaps you have simply seen what I have been too proud to see.\" He sets down the cup. \"The Order has spent two centuries nursing claims we will never recover. Properties in Acre, in Jerusalem, in a dozen cities that have fallen to the infidel or passed beyond our reach. We keep records, we maintain legal positions, we write letters to Popes demanding recognition of rights that exist only on parchment.\"\n\n\nHe laughs—a tired, honest sound.\n\n\n\"And what has it gained us? Nothing but bitterness. The Greeks hate us for what we once held. The Venetians resent our claims that overlap with theirs. Everyone remembers the Order's old grievances, and no one sends us the men and gold we need to survive.\"\n\n\nHe straightens, squaring his shoulders as if setting down a weight.\n\n\n\"Very well. I accept your terms.\"\n\n\nHe extends his hand again—firmly this time, with decision.\n\n\n\"One hundred fifty men and two galleys, as a permanent contribution to Constantinople's defense. The Order will purchase new properties with your generous grant, outside the Latin quarters, with no reference to old claims. We will earn our place through blood and service, as your Constitution demands. And when the time comes for war against the Turk, the full strength of Rhodes sails at your side.\"\n\n\nHis grip tightens.\n\n\n\"But I ask one thing more, King Juan. Not for the Order—for myself.\"\n\n\nHis eyes meet yours, and there is something vulnerable beneath the commander's steel.\n\n\n\"When you meet the Sultan—and I know you intend to—tell me what manner of man he is. I have fought his armies, captured his ships, interrogated his officers. But I have never looked into his eyes. I need to know: is he a man we can outlast? Or is he the one who will finally finish what his predecessors began?\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say?"

Let me narrate this and then set up the next journey.\n\nThe journey from Rhodes to Naples is longer - across the Mediterranean. Let me think about the route and potential hazards:\n- Rhodes to Naples is roughly 1,000+ nautical miles\n- Route would go: Rhodes → Crete → around the Peloponnese → through the Ionian Sea → up to Naples\n- Or potentially: Rhodes → south of Crete → Malta → Sicily → Naples\n- Duration: 2-3 weeks depending on winds and route\n- Season: Late May - generally good sailing weather\n- Hazards: pirates, storms, Angevin/Aragonese conflict in southern Italy (René of Anjou vs Alfonso V)\n\nLucia is now closer to 6 months pregnant by the time they reach Naples.\n\nLet me draft this scene and the d100 table for the voyage.\n\n\nDe Lastic grips your hand firmly one final time.\n\n\n\"When Constantinople calls, Rhodes answers.

They will participate in the muster and earn titles through contribution as the Constitution provides.\n\n\nThey request a commandery, a chapel, and a hospital. I have granted them 2,000 florins from our treasury to purchase and restore properties for this purpose. I have asked that they make no reference to old claims from before 1261, and the Grand Master has agreed. They will build anew, as partners in the apokatastasis, not as Franks demanding the return of stolen goods.\n\n\nReceive them as allies. They have fought the Turk for generations and know his ways. Their expertise will strengthen our walls.\n\n\nThe Grand Master has pledged the full strength of Rhodes—all his galleys, all his knights—should the Sultan move against the city in force. I have pledged the same from Castile.\n\n\nI sail now for Naples. Lucia is well; the child grows strong. God willing, I will return east when circumstances permit.\n\n\nHold the city, brother.

De Lastic provides detailed intelligence on Ottoman naval movements—the Sultan's fleet has been quiet this spring, focused on the Black Sea approaches rather than the Aegean. A small mercy.\n\n\nLucia has recovered well from the voyage. The physicians report no concerns with the pregnancy. Catalina has charmed half the Hospitaller knights, who are unused to children in their fortress-monastery.\n\n\nOn the morning of the 24th, the four carracks weigh anchor and turn west. Naples lies perhaps three weeks distant—across the open Mediterranean, past Crete and the Peloponnese, through waters contested by pirates, Venetians, Genoese, and the warring claimants to the Neapolitan throne.\n\n\nAlfonso V awaits. And René of Anjou, the French pretender who holds much of the kingdom.

One carrack is lost with all hands; another badly damaged. The flagship survives but Lucia is thrown during the storm—physicians fear for the pregnancy. Limp into a hostile or neutral port for emergency repairs. Severe delay, significant losses, and a medical crisis.\n6-10\nAngevin Interception — René of Anjou's Provençal galleys intercept the convoy near Sicily. Tense confrontation—they know you are Alfonso's ally. Demands to search the ships, veiled threats. No combat, but a humiliating delay and the certainty that René knows exactly when you will arrive in Naples. Your element of surprise, if any existed, is gone.\n11-20\nSerious Storm — Heavy weather forces the fleet to shelter for nearly a week. No losses, but supplies depleted, crew exhausted, Lucia confined to her cabin and miserable. Arrive in Naples significantly behind schedule, with everyone desperate to reach land.\n21-30\nPirate Attack — Corsairs strike at dawn near the Ionian islands—six or seven light galleys against four carracks. A running fight ensues. Your crossbowmen drive them off, but not before one carrack is boarded briefly. Casualties among the soldiers (10-20 men), damage to one ship, and a shaken convoy. Arrive in Naples late and bloodied.\n31-40\nContrary Winds and Delays — The Mediterranean refuses to cooperate. Calms alternate with headwinds, forcing the carracks to tack endlessly or wait for conditions to change. A three-week journey stretches to five. Supplies run low; tempers fray. Lucia grows increasingly uncomfortable as her pregnancy advances. Arrive exhausted and weeks behind schedule.\n41-55\nUneventful Passage — The voyage proceeds without significant incident. Winds are adequate, seas moderate. The fleet makes steady progress across the Mediterranean, past Crete, around the Peloponnese, through the Strait of Messina. Lucia rests as comfortably as shipboard life allows. Arrive in Naples on schedule, ready to face whatever awaits.\n56-70\nSmooth Sailing — Favorable winds and calm seas speed the convoy westward. The crossing is almost pleasant—warm days, clear nights, steady progress. Lucia spends time on deck, the color returning to her cheeks. Arrive in Naples a few days ahead of schedule, well-rested and prepared.\n71-80\nVenetian Courtesy — Near Crete, a Venetian patrol squadron approaches. Rather than hostility, they offer news: detailed intelligence on the situation in Naples, the disposition of René's forces, Alfonso's current position. Venice is hedging its bets, staying neutral but quietly favoring anyone who might stabilize Italy. Valuable information gained; arrival on schedule.\n81-90\nExcellent Passage — Exceptional conditions—the convoy makes remarkable time, arriving in Naples nearly a week early. Alfonso V, surprised by your swift arrival, scrambles to meet you. Your early appearance catches René's intelligence network off-guard; for once, you know more about the situation than your enemies expect. Strategic advantage gained.\n91-95\nTimely Rescue — The convoy encounters a ship in distress—an Aragonese vessel carrying dispatches and wounded men from a skirmish with Angevin forces. Your sailors rescue the survivors, who provide detailed, current intelligence on the military situation around Naples. Alfonso will be grateful; you arrive with information others would kill for.\n96-100\nAlfonso's Escort — As the convoy approaches Sicilian waters, a squadron of Aragonese war galleys appears—not hostile, but welcoming. Alfonso has sent an honor guard to escort you safely to Naples. They bring fresh supplies, news, and a personal letter from the King. You arrive in Naples under royal escort, your alliance publicly displayed for all of Italy to see.\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

A 5% chance of losing a ship with all hands in a routine voyage during favorable sailing season (late May/early June) does seem harsh. Let me think about this:\n\n1. The Mediterranean in late May/early June is generally favorable for sailing\n2. Carracks are sturdy, ocean-going vessels designed for rough conditions\n3. Captain Fernán is experienced\n4. This is a well-supplied, organized convoy\n5. While disasters do happen, a 1-5 roll resulting in automatic catastrophic loss feels like it removes player agency\n\nThe user's suggestion is good - instead of having pre-determined catastrophic outcomes, I could have the low rolls introduce serious challenges that we then roleplay through, potentially with additional rolls to determine how they play out.\n\nThis is more engaging and fair. A storm encounter could be roleplayed with decisions about whether to seek shelter, how to handle the situation, etc. The outcome would then depend on those choices and perhaps additional rolls.\n\nLet me redraft the table with this approach - low rolls introduce serious challenges/encounters rather than pre-determined disasters.\n\n\nYou raise an excellent point. A 5% chance of losing a ship with all hands on a routine voyage during favorable sailing season, with experienced crew and sturdy carracks, is too harsh. It removes player agency and feels arbitrary rather than realistic.\n\n\nLet me redraft with a different approach: low rolls introduce serious challenges that we then roleplay through, with outcomes depending on Juan's decisions and potentially follow-up rolls.\n\n\n\nJourney to Naples — d100 Table (Revised)\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nSerious Storm Encounter — A major storm system develops as the fleet passes between Crete and the Peloponnese. Captain Fernán spots the signs and warns you: seek shelter immediately in a nearby port, or try to outrun it and risk being caught in open water. Roleplay the decision; follow-up rolls determine consequences based on Juan's choice.\n11-20\nNaval Encounter — Angevin Sails — René of Anjou's Provençal galleys sight the convoy near Sicily. They move to intercept. Captain Fernán reports: eight galleys against four carracks. We can run, negotiate, or prepare to fight. Roleplay the encounter; Juan's decisions shape the outcome.\n21-30\nPirate Sighting — Corsair sails spotted in the Ionian Sea—a substantial flotilla, six or seven galleys, moving to intercept. They are probing, testing your strength. Roleplay the encounter: show force, flee, negotiate, or fight?\n31-40\nContrary Winds and Delays — The winds refuse to cooperate. Calms alternate with headwinds. What should take three weeks threatens to stretch to five. Supplies adequate but morale suffers. Lucia grows increasingly uncomfortable. Arrive in Naples 10-14 days behind schedule, but intact.\n41-55\nUneventful Passage — The voyage proceeds without significant incident. Winds adequate, seas moderate. Steady progress past Crete, around the Peloponnese, through the Strait of Messina. Arrive in Naples on schedule.\n56-70\nSmooth Sailing — Favorable winds and calm seas. Almost pleasant—warm days, clear nights, good progress. Lucia spends time on deck. Arrive a few days ahead of schedule, well-rested.\n71-80\nVenetian Courtesy — Near Crete, a Venetian patrol offers news: intelligence on Naples, René's forces, Alfonso's position. Venice is hedging bets but quietly informative. Valuable information gained; arrival on schedule.\n81-90\nExcellent Passage — Exceptional conditions. Arrive nearly a week early, catching René's intelligence off-guard. Strategic advantage gained.\n91-95\nTimely Rescue — Encounter a distressed Aragonese vessel with wounded men and dispatches. Current military intelligence gained; Alfonso will be grateful.\n96-100\nAlfonso's Escort — Aragonese war galleys meet you near Sicily with supplies, news, and a royal welcome.

The sailors have been specifically trained for storm scenarios\n2. These are sturdy carracks with experienced crew\n3. Captain Fernán is competent and experienced\n4. Lucia is 6 months pregnant, which adds stakes but shouldn't make everything catastrophic\n\nLet me set the scene and present Juan with meaningful choices. The training should factor in as a success factor if we need follow-up rolls, but first let's roleplay the situation.\n\n\nThe Storm\n\n\nJune 3, 1434 — Between Crete and the Peloponnese\n\n\nNine days out from Rhodes. The crossing has been smooth—too smooth, Captain Fernán mutters, touching the wooden rail superstitiously. The Mediterranean in late spring can turn quickly.\n\n\nYou are on deck with Lucia, watching the sunset paint the western sky in shades of orange and crimson, when Fernán approaches. His weathered face is troubled.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He points toward the southwest, where the beautiful colors are darkening into something else—a line of black cloud building on the horizon, moving fast. \"That's no ordinary squall. I've seen formations like that twice in thirty years at sea. Both times, ships went down.\"\n\n\nHe pulls out a rough chart, pointing to your position.\n\n\n\"We're here—open water, perhaps sixty miles from the nearest shelter. The island of Kythera lies to the northwest. There's a bay there, good anchorage, but we'd be sailing across the storm's path to reach it. If we time it wrong, we're caught beam-on to the wind in the worst of it.\"\n\n\nHe traces an alternative route.\n\n\n\"Or we run before it. Turn east, let the storm push us back toward Crete. We lose days—maybe a week—but we keep the wind at our backs and ride it out in open water. The carracks can take heavy seas if we're not fighting them.\"\n\n\nA third option, unspoken, hangs in the air: press on westward and try to outrun it entirely. Risky, but if the storm is slower than it appears...\n\n\nFernán meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"The men are trained for rough weather, Your Majesty. We drilled them hard before we ever left Castile—reefing sails in high wind, securing cargo, working the pumps. They won't panic.\" He glances toward the cabin where Lucia rests. \"But the Queen... six months along, and heavy seas are no friend to a woman with child.\"\n\n\nThe black line on the horizon is visibly closer now. You have perhaps two hours before it hits.\n\n\n\"Your orders, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed success factors against storm timing risks comprehensively.\n\nJuan has decided to make for Kythera, racing across the storm's path to reach shelter. This is a calculated risk - if they time it right, they reach safe harbor. If they time it wrong, they're caught in open water with the storm hitting them from the side (beam-on), which is the most dangerous angle.\n\nLet me consider the factors:\n\nSuccess Factors:\n- Well-trained crew, specifically drilled for rough weather\n- Experienced Captain Fernán with 30 years experience\n- Sturdy carracks built for ocean voyages\n- Two hours head start before the storm hits\n- Juan making a decisive call early, not waiting until it's too late\n- Four ships can help each other if one gets in trouble\n\nFailure Factors:\n- Racing across the storm's path is risky\n- 60 miles to Kythera - that's a significant distance\n- Storm is moving fast\n- Lucia is 6 months pregnant - stress and rough seas are dangerous\n- If timing is wrong, they're caught beam-on (worst case)\n- Unknown exactly how fast the storm is moving\n\nGiven the trained crew and early decision, I should weight this toward success but keep real danger in the lower rolls. The key variable is timing - do they make it to shelter before the storm hits, or are they caught partway there?\n\nLet me draft a table that reflects realistic outcomes based on Juan's decision and the crew's training.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán nods sharply. \"Kythera it is. All hands!\"\n\n\nThe deck erupts into controlled chaos. Sailors swarm the rigging, adjusting sails to catch every breath of wind. Signal flags break out on the mainmast, passing the order to the other three carracks: Follow the flagship. Make for shelter. All speed.\n\n\nThe trained crew moves with precision—no wasted motion, no panic. This is what you drilled them for.\n\n\n\nRace to Kythera — d100 Table\n\n\nThe Situation: Four carracks racing northwest toward Kythera, trying to reach the sheltered bay before a major storm catches them in open water. Approximately 60 miles to cover; perhaps two hours before the storm hits.\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nCrew specifically trained for rough weather scenarios\n\nExperienced Captain Fernán making the calls\n\nEarly decision—not waiting until the last moment\n\nSturdy carracks designed for heavy seas\n\nFour ships traveling together can assist each other\n\nClear objective and good seamanship\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nRacing across the storm's path, not away from it\n\nIf timing fails, caught beam-on to the wind (worst angle)\n\n60 miles is significant distance in two hours\n\nStorm speed uncertain—may arrive faster than expected\n\nLucia six months pregnant; stress and rough seas are dangerous\n\nUnknown conditions in Kythera's bay—is it truly sheltered?\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nCaught in the Open — The storm moves faster than Fernán predicted. With Kythera still visible on the horizon but unreachable, the full fury strikes. The fleet must survive in open water, beam-on to monstrous waves. Follow-up roll to determine damage and casualties; crew training provides bonuses.\n11-20\nDesperate Final Miles — The storm catches the fleet within sight of Kythera's bay. Pounding rain, howling wind, massive swells—but shelter is close. The crew fights to bring the ships in through the storm. Follow-up roll for each ship entering the bay in heavy weather; training helps but risk remains.\n21-35\nClose Run — The fleet reaches Kythera's bay just as the first heavy squalls hit. Anchoring in rising winds and choppy water is difficult and dangerous. One carrack drags anchor and nearly runs aground before the crew recovers. Minor damage, frayed nerves, but all ships and crew safe. Lucia shaken but unharmed.\n36-50\nNarrow Victory — The carracks slip into Kythera's bay with perhaps half an hour to spare. The crew works frantically to secure anchors and furl sails before the full storm arrives. They succeed—barely. The fleet rides out the storm at anchor, ships heaving but holding. A tense night, but no damage, no casualties.\n51-65\nGood Timing — Fernán's experience proves true. The fleet reaches shelter with time to spare, anchoring properly and securing all gear before the storm breaks. The bay is well-protected; the ships barely rock while the tempest rages outside. Lucia rests comfortably. A day's delay waiting for the storm to pass, nothing more.\n66-80\nTextbook Execution — The trained crew performs flawlessly. Every sail adjusted perfectly, every order executed without hesitation. The fleet not only reaches Kythera but anchors in optimal positions with time to run additional safety lines. When the storm hits, it barely troubles the well-prepared ships. Fernán permits himself a rare smile. Minor delay only.\n81-90\nStorm Veers — As the fleet approaches Kythera, the storm shifts course slightly southward—missing the bay entirely. What looked like disaster becomes merely dramatic skies and a good story. The fleet shelters overnight anyway out of caution, but could have pressed on. No delay beyond one night's rest.\n91-100\nLocal Knowledge — As the fleet approaches Kythera, a Greek fishing boat races out to meet you, the captain waving urgently. He guides you to a better anchorage on the island's lee side—more sheltered than the main bay, unknown to most sailors. The fleet rides out the storm in perfect safety, and the grateful fisherman shares news from the Greek islands. Gain local intelligence; minimal delay.\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

The storm shifts course and misses them. They shelter overnight out of caution but could have pressed on. No significant delay.\n\nThen they want to continue sailing to Naples. I should narrate the successful avoidance of the storm and then the rest of the journey to Naples. Since they already rolled for the overall journey (rolled 7, which led to this storm encounter), and now they've successfully navigated through it, I should probably just narrate the remainder of the journey to Naples without another major roll unless something else comes up.\n\nLet me write a satisfying conclusion to the storm encounter and then narrate their arrival in Naples.\n\n\nThe Storm Veers\n\n\nThe black wall of cloud looms ever larger as the four carracks race northwest, every sail straining. Fernán stands at the helm, eyes fixed on the horizon, calculating distances and wind speeds with thirty years of experience.\n\n\n\"It's going to be close,\" he mutters.\n\n\nBut then—something shifts. The leading edge of the storm, which had been bearing directly toward your path, begins to curve southward. The wind that drives it is pulling the whole system away from Kythera, toward the open sea south of Crete.\n\n\nFernán watches for a long moment, then exhales slowly.\n\n\n\"God is merciful today, Your Majesty. She's veering off.\"\n\n\nBy the time the fleet reaches Kythera's bay, the storm is a dark smear on the southern horizon, lightning flickering in its depths—terrifying to behold, but no longer a threat. The sea around you remains choppy but manageable.\n\n\n\"We shelter here tonight anyway,\" Fernán decides. \"No sense tempting fate twice. But we could have pressed on.\"\n\n\nLucia emerges from the cabin as the anchors drop, one hand on her belly, the other gripping the rail. She looks at the distant storm, then at you.\n\n\n\"I felt the ship turning. The crew shouting.\" A small smile. \"Then it all went quiet. I assumed either we had reached safety or we were all about to die. I decided to come see which.\"\n\n\nThe night passes peacefully. The storm spends its fury on empty water far to the south.\n\n\n\nThe Remainder of the Voyage\n\n\nJune 4-15, 1434\n\n\nFrom Kythera, the fleet rounds the Peloponnese without incident. The seas are calm, the winds favorable—as if the Mediterranean is apologizing for the scare it gave you.\n\n\nYou pass through the Ionian Sea, keeping well clear of the coastline where pirates lurk. Past Cephalonia and Corfu, then across to the heel of Italy. The Strait of Messina—that narrow, treacherous passage between Sicily and the mainland—proves surprisingly gentle, the infamous currents quiet under summer conditions.\n\n\nLucia grows larger by the day. The physicians report the child is active, positioned well. \"A strong boy,\" they predict, though they have been wrong before. She spends mornings on deck when the weather permits, reading letters from home, watching the Italian coastline slide past.\n\n\nOn the fifteenth of June, the lookout calls from the masthead:\n\n\n\"Napoli! Naples ahead!\"\n\n\n\nNaples — June 15, 1434\n\n\nThe city emerges from the morning haze—a jumble of towers and domes climbing the hills above a great curved bay, dominated by the brooding mass of Castel Nuovo, the Angevin fortress that has changed hands so many times in living memory.\n\n\nThe harbor is busy but not packed. You count perhaps thirty ships at anchor—merchants mostly, a few war galleys flying Aragonese colors. No sign of Angevin naval presence, which suggests Alfonso controls the sea approaches at least.\n\n\nAs your carracks enter the bay, signal flags break out from Castel Nuovo. A pilot boat rows out to meet you, and soon an Aragonese officer is climbing aboard the flagship, breathless and grinning.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty! King Alfonso has been expecting you—though not so soon. He will be overjoyed.\" The man's Catalan accent is thick but comprehensible. \"The King is at the Castel. Shall I signal that you wish to land immediately?\"\n\n\nHe hesitates, then adds more quietly:\n\n\n\"Much has changed since Your Majesty's last news, I think. The war goes... not badly, but not well either. The King will want to speak with you urgently.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

The emerging situation requires careful calculation of potential risks and opportunities. Each option presents unique advantages and potential consequences for maintaining Ottoman regional influence.\n\nThe key considerations involve preserving the existing tribute system, preventing a unified Christian alliance, and maintaining strategic flexibility while assessing the new Byzantine-Castilian relationship. Murad must decide whether immediate action or patient observation serves his long-term imperial objectives more effectively.\n\nA measured diplomatic approach seems most prudent - accepting tribute, gathering intelligence, and positioning for potential future military action without committing to an expensive, risky siege that could damage Ottoman prestige if unsuccessful.\n\nMurad would likely probe the situation carefully, seeking to understand Juan's true motivations through the proposed meeting. The unusual letter - with its theological depth and respectful tone - suggests a complex diplomatic strategy that demands careful analysis. Is this a genuine overture or a sophisticated manipulation? The Sultan would want to unravel these nuanced intentions while maintaining strategic flexibility.\n\n\nI need to think carefully about Sultan Murad II's position, options, and likely responses. Let me consider this from the NPC guide's perspective.\n\n\n\nSultan Murad II — Situation Analysis\n\n\nWho is Murad II?\n\n\nSultan of the Ottoman Empire since 1421 (age ~30 in 1434)\n\nConquered Thessalonica in 1430—knows how to take fortified cities\n\nExperienced ruler who has dealt with internal rebellions, Karamanid threats in the east, and European crusade attempts\n\nPragmatic statesman—has made truces when advantageous\n\nPatient; time is generally on the Ottoman side\n\n\nWhat does Murad want?\n\n\nEventually to take Constantinople, completing Ottoman control of both shores\n\nStability on his western frontier while managing other threats\n\nContinued tribute payments from Byzantium\n\nTo prevent a major Christian coalition forming against him\n\nTo assess this new Castilian threat before committing to action\n\n\nWhat has Murad learned?\n\n\nA Latin king arrived in Constantinople with ~900 soldiers\n\nNotaras—his informant—has been arrested, tried, and executed\n\nThe Emperor has been \"liberated\" and is acting independently for the first time in years\n\nJuan has been named \"Defensor Romaniae\"—a direct challenge to Ottoman supremacy\n\nThe Ottoman embassy was expelled—a diplomatic insult\n\nMilitary preparations underway: wall repairs, militia training, cannons forged\n\nByzantine-Castilian financial arrangements ensure tribute can be paid\n\nJuan's letter: Respectful tone, theological questions, offer to deliver tribute personally, request for a meeting on neutral ground\n\n\nMurad's Options:\n\n\nImmediate War — Attack Constantinople now while Juan is away and defenses incomplete\n\nPrepare for War — Begin mobilization for a major campaign in 1-2 years\n\nDiplomatic Engagement — Accept the meeting, assess Juan, buy time\n\nIntimidation — Military demonstrations, harsh demands, pressure without full commitment\n\nStrategic Patience — Accept tribute, observe, wait for the coalition to fracture on its own\n\n\n\nFactors Favoring War:\n\n\nThe longer he waits, the stronger Constantinople becomes\n\nHis intelligence network (Notaras) is destroyed\n\nThe peace treaty is being violated (military buildup, foreign troops)\n\nJuan is away—the city lacks its new protector\n\nA decisive blow now could end the Byzantine problem forever\n\nEvery year of delay allows more Western involvement\n\n\nFactors Against Immediate War:\n\n\nMurad has other concerns (Karamanids in the east, internal consolidation)\n\nA siege of Constantinople is enormously expensive—requires massive army, fleet, supplies\n\nThe walls remain formidable even partially repaired\n\n715 Military Order soldiers + incoming Hospitallers = real garrison\n\nA failed siege would be catastrophic for Ottoman prestige and embolden enemies\n\nJuan has offered to pay tribute—money Murad needs\n\nJuan's letter is intriguing—this is not how Latin kings usually write\n\nMurad may want to take this unusual king's measure personally\n\nTime remains on the Ottoman side; Byzantium is not going anywhere\n\nWestern coalitions historically fracture on their own\n\n\nThe Letter's Effect:\nJuan's letter is unexpected. Theological questions about shared Abrahamic heritage, respectful tone, acknowledgment of Murad's position—this is sophisticated diplomacy, not the usual crusader bluster. Murad would be intrigued. Is this genuine? A trick? A delaying tactic? The Sultan did not become Sultan by being incurious about unusual opponents.\n\n\n\nSultan Murad II's Response — d100 Table\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nImmediate War — Murad concludes the time for patience has ended. Within weeks of receiving news, he begins mobilizing for a full siege of Constantinople. Army summoned, fleet prepared, siege equipment gathered. The attack will come before winter 1434—while Juan is in Naples, while the walls are incomplete, while the coalition is still forming. Constantinople receives word: the Sultan is coming.\n6-15\nAggressive Rejection — Murad sends a harsh reply to Juan's letter. No meeting. The \"Defensor Romaniae\" is a pretender meddling in Ottoman affairs. The tribute will be collected—doubled, as penalty for violations of the peace. Ottoman naval patrols intensify around Constantinople. Military demonstrations on the Thracian frontier. War is not declared, but the message is clear: the Sultan is displeased, and there will be consequences.\n16-25\nCold Dismissal — No reply to Juan's letter. Silence. Ottoman ambassadors are withdrawn from Christian courts. The tribute demand continues through normal channels, but all diplomatic engagement ceases. Murad is watching, waiting, gathering intelligence. He will act when he is ready, not when a Latin king requests a meeting. Ominous quiet.\n26-40\nWary Calculation — Murad sends a brief, formal acknowledgment. He notes Juan's letter with interest but makes no commitment to a meeting. The tribute will be accepted when delivered. The theological questions are neither answered nor rejected. The Sultan is buying time, assessing the threat, preparing options. Military activity continues at normal levels—neither escalation nor de-escalation. He is thinking.\n41-55\nCautious Engagement — Murad replies formally but not warmly. He acknowledges Juan's status and the changed situation in Constantinople. A meeting may be possible, but conditions must be discussed through intermediaries first. The tribute arrangement is acceptable. The theological questions receive a brief, noncommittal response—neither embracing dialogue nor rejecting it. The door is open a crack.\n56-70\nPragmatic Interest — Murad sends a substantive reply. He agrees in principle to a meeting when Juan delivers the tribute—neutral ground, mutual security guarantees, proper diplomatic protocol. The theological questions receive thoughtful responses; the Sultan is educated and enjoys intellectual discourse. He is curious about this unusual Latin king. War is not imminent, but Murad makes clear he is not fooled—he knows what Juan is building, and he is building too.\n71-80\nIntrigued Acceptance — Murad's reply is surprisingly warm. He accepts the meeting proposal and suggests a location. The theological questions receive extensive, scholarly answers—Murad quotes the Quran on Jesus (Isa), on Abraham (Ibrahim), on the shared heritage of the People of the Book. He writes that he has never received such a letter from a Christian king and wonders what manner of man sends it. The tribute arrangement is confirmed. A genuine diplomatic opening.\n81-90\nStrategic Opportunity Recognized — Murad sees in Juan's letter something unexpected: a potential partner for stability, not just another enemy. His reply proposes not just a meeting but ongoing diplomatic channels. He suggests that men of reason can find arrangements that benefit both sides. The tribute is acceptable; perhaps other arrangements are possible. He answers the theological questions at length and poses questions of his own. Murad is exploring whether this Latin king might be someone he can work with—or at least someone worth understanding before deciding whether to destroy.\n91-95\nThe Scholar-Sultan Responds — Murad's reply is remarkable: a lengthy, personal letter engaging deeply with Juan's theological questions. He writes of the ahl al-kitab—the People of the Book—and the Quranic respect for Christian and Jewish prophets. He quotes Islamic scholars on the nature of God, the role of Jesus, the legacy of Abraham. He proposes a meeting not merely to exchange hostages and tribute but to continue this conversation. \"You ask questions no Frank has asked me before. I would know the man behind such questions.\" A genuine intellectual connection offered across the religious divide.\n96-100\nA Sultan's Gambit — Murad's reply contains a surprise: he proposes meeting before the tribute delivery, at a location of mutual convenience. He suggests Rhodes—neutral Hospitaller territory where neither party holds advantage. He writes that the situation has changed and that wise rulers adapt to change. He does not offer peace—he is too shrewd for that—but he offers something almost unprecedented: a direct conversation between the Sultan and a Christian king, outside the context of war or surrender. He wants to take Juan's measure, and he is willing to extend himself to do so. Whatever Murad is planning, he has decided that understanding Juan is essential to it.\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

      "say": "Thought process: Calculated courier timelines across Mediterranean routes.\n\nThe user wants to understand the timeline of when Juan would receive the Sultan's response. Let me think through this:\n\n1. Juan sent the letter from Constantinople around May 12-15, 1434\n2. The letter needs to travel from Constantinople to the Ottoman court (likely Edirne/Adrianople, the Ottoman capital at this time)\n3. Murad needs time to consider and respond\n4. The response needs to travel back\n\nJuan is now in Naples as of June 15, 1434.\n\nDistance from Constantinople to Edirne: About 200-250 km overland. A courier could cover this in 3-5 days.\n\nSo the letter probably reached Murad around May 17-20.\n\nMurad's response (rolled 50 - Cautious Engagement) means he's taking his time, considering carefully, and sending a formal but non-committal response. This suggests he wouldn't respond immediately - he'd deliberate, consult advisors, perhaps gather more intelligence.\n\nLet's say Murad takes 2-3 weeks to deliberate and craft his response. So his reply might be sent around early-mid June.\n\nThe reply would go back to Constantinople (the address Juan would have given, since that's where his representatives are). That takes another 3-5 days.\n\nThen from Constantinople, word needs to reach Juan in Naples. This is trickier - it would need to go by ship, which could take 2-3 weeks depending on conditions.\n\nSo realistically:\n- Letter reaches Murad: ~May 17-20\n- Murad deliberates and responds: ~June 5-10\n- Response reaches Constantinople: ~June 10-15\n- Response forwarded to Juan in Naples: Could take another 2-3 weeks by ship\n\nSo Juan might learn of the Sultan's response in late June or early July 1434, while he's still in Naples.\n\nAlternatively, if the Sultan's response is sent directly to Juan (knowing he's heading to Naples), it might be sent via a fast Ottoman courier ship that intercepts him or arrives in Naples. But that seems less likely for a \"cautious engagement\" response.\n\n\nI'll craft a narrative description that captures the diplomatic communication's nuanced timeline, highlighting the deliberate and measured nature of Ottoman diplomatic correspondence.\n\n\nGood question. Let me work through the timeline:\n\n\n\nCommunication Timeline\n\n\nJuan's Letter Sent: May 12-13, 1434 (from Constantinople)\n\n\nLetter Reaches Ottoman Court (Edirne): May 17-20, 1434\n\n\nEdirne is approximately 200-250 km from Constantinople\n\nOttoman courier network is efficient; 3-5 days overland\n\n\nMurad Deliberates:\n\n\nA \"Cautious Engagement\" response suggests careful consideration\n\nConsultations with advisors, weighing options\n\nCrafting a formal reply that commits to nothing while leaving doors open\n\nEstimate: 2-3 weeks of deliberation\n\n\nMurad's Reply Sent: Early June 1434 (approximately June 5-10)\n\n\nReply Reaches Constantinople: June 10-15\n\n\nDelivered to Sphrantzes or whoever Juan designated to receive correspondence\n\nThe Emperor would be informed\n\n\nReply Forwarded to Juan in Naples:\n\n\nMust travel by ship from Constantinople to Naples\n\nApproximately 1,000+ nautical miles\n\n2-3 weeks under normal conditions\n\n\nJuan Receives Sultan's Response: Late June to early July 1434\n\n\n\nSo Juan would likely learn of Murad's cautious, noncommittal reply while still in Naples, perhaps around the end of June or first week of July—roughly 2-3 weeks after arriving.\n\n\nShall we continue with the Naples landing and your meeting with Alfonso, keeping this timeline in mind?"

Let me search the project files to find the Naples situation.\n\nFrom what I recall from earlier searches:\n- King Alfonso V of Aragon was in a dire situation in Naples\n- René of Anjou arrived with 10,000 men (French knights, Provençal infantry, Genoese crossbowmen)\n- Battle of Aversa happened - Alfonso lost 2,000 men, Sforza fled\n- Alfonso held only Naples city and perhaps a dozen miles around it\n- Juan committed Castile to war and ordered Álvaro de Luna to raise 15,000 men under Don Íñigo López de Mendoza\n\nLet me search for more details.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Reconstructed Naples crisis and prepared outcome framework.\n\nBased on the search results, I can piece together the Naples situation:\n\n**When Juan left Naples (late March 1434):**\n- René of Anjou had arrived in January 1434 with 10,000 men (French knights, Provençal infantry, Genoese crossbowmen)\n- Battle of Aversa happened two weeks before Juan arrived - Alfonso lost 2,000 men\n- Sforza's condottieri broke and Sforza fled to Milan to renegotiate his contract—potentially with René\n- Alfonso held only Naples city and perhaps a dozen miles around\n- Calabrian barons \"reconsidering their positions\"\n- Queen Joanna had gone silent\n- René was sitting at Aversa, waiting for Alfonso to starve or surrender\n\n**Juan's response:**\n- Committed Castile to war in Italy\n- Ordered Álvaro de Luna to raise 15,000 men (noble levies and crown troops)\n- Don Íñigo López de Mendoza to hold overall command\n- Transport to Sicily; assemble at Palermo by July 1434\n\nSo now it's June 15, 1434. The Castilian army was supposed to assemble at Palermo by July 1434. They might be en route or nearly ready.\n\nThe question is: what has happened in Naples between late March and mid-June? Has Alfonso been able to hold Naples city for nearly 3 months while René besieged him?\n\nLet me draft a d100 table for this.\n\n\n\nNaples Situation — Summary of What Juan Left Behind\n\n\nWhen Juan departed Naples (late March 1434):\n\n\nRené of Anjou arrived January 1434 with 10,000 men (French knights, Provençal infantry, Genoese crossbowmen)\n\nBattle of Aversa (two weeks before Juan's visit): Alfonso lost 2,000 men; Sforza's condottieri broke against French heavy cavalry\n\nSforza fled to Milan to renegotiate his contract—possibly with René\n\nAlfonso held only Naples city and perhaps a dozen miles in any direction\n\nCalabrian barons \"reconsidering their positions\"\n\nQueen Joanna II had gone silent\n\nRené sat at Aversa, waiting for Alfonso to starve or surrender\n\n\nJuan's Orders (sent to Álvaro de Luna, late March 1434):\n\n\nRaise an army of 15,000 men (noble levies and crown troops)\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza to hold overall command\n\nTransport to Sicily; assemble at Palermo by July 1434\n\nSupplies and transport from crown treasury\n\n\nCurrent Date: June 15, 1434\n\n\nTime Elapsed: Approximately 2.5 months since Juan left\n\n\nQuestions to Resolve:\n\n\nHas Alfonso held Naples city against René's siege/pressure?\n\nHas René pressed a full siege, or is he also waiting?\n\nWhat is the status of the Castilian relief army?\n\nHave the Calabrian barons declared for one side or the other?\n\nWhat happened with Sforza?\n\n\n\nNaples Situation — d100 Table\n\n\nSuccess Factors (for Alfonso holding):\n\n\nNaples city has strong fortifications (Castel Nuovo, Castel dell'Ovo)\n\nAlfonso has naval superiority—can receive supplies by sea\n\nRené's army must be fed and paid; siege warfare is expensive\n\nCalabrian barons may be waiting to see who wins before committing\n\nNews of Castilian relief army coming may discourage René from all-out assault\n\nAlfonso is a stubborn, experienced commander\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nRené has overwhelming land forces (10,000+ men)\n\nAlfonso lost his field army at Aversa\n\nSforza's defection removed experienced condottieri\n\nItalian politics are treacherous—anyone might switch sides\n\nFrench gold from Milan and Genoa backs René\n\n2.5 months is a long time to hold with no relief\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nNaples Fallen — The worst has happened. René breached the walls or Alfonso's garrison mutinied for lack of pay. Naples city is in Angevin hands. Alfonso has fled—to Sicily, to Aragon, or he may be a prisoner. The Castilian relief army arrives to find no ally to relieve. The war must become reconquest, not relief.\n6-15\nDesperate Straits — Alfonso still holds Castel Nuovo and the harbor, but the city itself has fallen to René. He is besieged in the fortress with dwindling supplies, holding on by fingernails. Without immediate relief, he will be forced to surrender or flee within weeks. The Castilian army's arrival is his only hope.\n16-25\nCritical Situation — Naples holds, but barely. René's forces have taken the outer districts; fighting continues street by street. Alfonso's men are exhausted, supplies critically low. Calabrian barons have mostly declared for René. Morale is crumbling. Relief must come soon or all is lost.\n26-40\nHard Pressed — Alfonso holds Naples city and the castles, but René has tightened the siege. No major assaults yet—René is trying to starve him out. Some Calabrian barons have declared for René; others remain neutral. Supplies coming by sea keep Alfonso alive, but he cannot break out. Stalemate favoring René.\n41-55\nHolding Steady — Alfonso has held Naples through determination and naval supply. René besieges but has not pressed major assaults—perhaps waiting for Alfonso to starve, perhaps wary of costly attacks. The situation is stable but precarious. Calabrian barons remain uncommitted, waiting to see who wins. Both sides await reinforcement.\n56-70\nResilient Defense — Alfonso has held well. René attempted one major assault and was repulsed with significant losses. The siege continues but René's army shows signs of strain—desertion, disease, supply problems of their own. Calabrian barons remain neutral but are watching with new respect for Alfonso's resilience. The Castilian army's approach is known; René must decide whether to fight or negotiate.\n71-80\nTurning Point — Alfonso has not merely survived but stabilized. René's siege has stalled; a sortie from Naples bloodied the French badly. Some Calabrian barons have quietly renewed contact with Alfonso. Sforza has sent word from Milan—he might be persuaded to switch sides again if the price is right. The arrival of Castilian forces could tip the balance decisively.\n81-90\nUnexpected Strength — Alfonso has done better than anyone expected. Venetian \"merchants\" have been supplying him—Venice hedging against French dominance in Italy. René's army is plagued by disease and the summer heat. Two Calabrian barons have openly re-declared for Alfonso. The siege is weakening. When news of the Castilian fleet's approach reaches the camps, René will face hard choices.\n91-95\nRené Faltering — The siege has become a disaster for René. Disease swept his camp; hundreds dead, thousands sick. Genoese funding has dried up (they have their own problems). Milan's support wavers. René still holds the field but cannot press the siege effectively. Alfonso has actually expanded his perimeter in recent weeks. The Castilian arrival will find an ally on the offensive, not defensive.\n96-100\nDramatic Reversal — Sforza has switched sides again, bringing 3,000 condottieri back to Alfonso's banner. René, betrayed and outmaneuvered, has retreated from Naples to Aversa to consolidate. The siege is broken. Alfonso holds Naples and is preparing to take the war to René. The Castilian army arrives to join a campaign of conquest, not a desperate relief.\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

Let me narrate what has happened in Naples and set up the scene for Juan's arrival.\n\nAlfonso has held well. René attempted one major assault and was repulsed with significant losses. The siege continues but René's army shows signs of strain—desertion, disease, supply problems of their own. Calabrian barons remain neutral but are watching with new respect for Alfonso's resilience. The Castilian army's approach is known; René must decide whether to fight or negotiate.\n\nNow I need to:\n1. Describe the situation when Juan arrives\n2. Set up the meeting with Alfonso\n3. Check on the status of the Castilian relief army (which should be assembling at Palermo by July 1434 - we're in mid-June, so they should be close)\n\nLet me write this scene.\n\n\nResilient Defense\n\n\nNaples — June 15, 1434\n\n\nThe Aragonese officer leads you through the bustling harbor toward Castel Nuovo. The fortress dominates the waterfront—massive, brooding, its towers scarred by recent combat but unbowed. Aragonese banners fly from every battlement.\n\n\nAs you walk, the officer—a young captain named Diego de Àvalos—provides a rapid summary of the past ten weeks.\n\n\n\"His Majesty has held, by God's grace and stubbornness in equal measure.\" He gestures toward the northern walls, where you can see evidence of hasty repairs. \"René threw everything at us six weeks ago. A full assault—scaling ladders, siege towers, the works. French knights and Genoese crossbowmen, thousands of them.\"\n\n\nHe allows himself a grim smile.\n\n\n\"They broke against the walls like waves on rock. We killed perhaps eight hundred, wounded twice that. The Duke of Calabria—René's best commander—took a crossbow bolt through the shoulder. They haven't tried again since.\"\n\n\nYou pass through streets that show the strain of siege—thin faces, boarded windows, the quiet tension of a city that has been holding its breath for months.\n\n\n\"But we cannot break out,\" de Àvalos continues. \"René still has perhaps seven thousand men in the field, camped from Aversa to the northern approaches. We hold Naples, the castles, the harbor. They hold everything else.\" He shrugs. \"A stalemate. But stalemates favor the defender only so long as supplies hold.\"\n\n\n\"And supplies?\"\n\n\n\"The sea remains ours. Sicilian grain, Aragonese wine, Catalan salt fish—enough to keep us fed, if not fat. René has no fleet worth mentioning; the Genoese promised him ships but they've been... slow to arrive.\" A knowing look. \"Someone in Genoa may be having second thoughts about backing the French.\"\n\n\nHe pauses at the castle gate, lowering his voice.\n\n\n\"The Calabrian barons watch and wait. They declared nothing after Aversa—too canny to commit until they see who wins. But word has spread of our defense. Some have sent quiet messages to His Majesty. Nothing open, not yet. But they're no longer certain René will triumph.\"\n\n\n\"And Sforza?\"\n\n\nDe Àvalos's expression sours. \"The snake sits in Milan, counting his gold and waiting to see which way to slither. He sends letters to both camps, promising nothing, demanding everything. His Majesty would sooner trust a viper.\"\n\n\n\nThe Castel Nuovo\n\n\nKing Alfonso V of Aragon receives you in the great hall of Castel Nuovo. He looks older than when you saw him last—thinner, harder, the softness of court life burned away by months of siege. But his eyes are bright, and he embraces you fiercely.\n\n\n\"Juan! Gracias a Dios.\" He holds you at arm's length, examining you. \"You look well. Constantinople agreed with you, it seems.\"\n\n\nHe waves away the courtiers, keeping only Don Bernat de Centelles and a few trusted officers. When the doors close, his manner shifts from formal welcome to frank assessment.\n\n\n\"You've heard the situation. We've held—barely. René bleeds men to disease and desertion every week, but so do we. This cannot continue forever.\" He moves to a map table, where the positions around Naples are marked with colored pins. \"What news of the relief army?\"\n\n\n\"Don Íñigo López de Mendoza commands. Fifteen thousand men, assembling at Palermo. They should be ready by July, as ordered.\"\n\n\nAlfonso nods slowly. \"Good. Good.\" He traces the map with his finger. \"René knows they're coming. His scouts have reported Castilian ships in Sicilian waters. He must decide soon: fight us with a hostile army at his back, or...\"\n\n\n\"Or?\"\n\n\nAlfonso looks up, his expression complicated.\n\n\n\"He has sent an envoy. Three days ago. Proposing terms.\"\n\n\nHe reaches into his doublet and produces a folded letter, sealed with the arms of Anjou.\n\n\n\"René offers a truce. One year. Both sides hold what they have. No offensive operations. He withdraws to Aversa and the north; I keep Naples and the coast. At the end of the year, we negotiate a permanent settlement—or resume the war.\"\n\n\nAlfonso sets the letter on the table between you.\n\n\n\"I have not replied. I wanted to wait for you.\" His jaw tightens. \"Part of me wants to reject it outright. He invaded my kingdom. He broke my army at Aversa. He has besieged my capital for four months. And now, when Castilian swords are about to tip the balance, he wants peace?\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"But another part of me remembers that fifteen thousand men marching through a Neapolitan summer will lose hundreds to heat and fever before they ever see battle. That even if we defeat René in the field, French pride will demand revenge—and Philip of Burgundy and the King of France will not forget that Castile and Aragon humiliated their kinsman. That this war could drag on for years, bleeding both our kingdoms while the Turk grows stronger.\"\n\n\nHe gestures at the letter.\n\n\n\"You have committed Castile to this fight. Your men, your gold, your reputation. So I ask you, cousin: What would you have me do? Fight, and destroy René utterly? Or accept his truce, and use the year to strengthen our position for whatever comes next?\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say?"

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed logistical challenges against assembly success factors comprehensively.\n\nThe user wants to see how well the Castilian relief army was assembled in Palermo. Juan ordered 15,000 men to assemble there by July 1434, under Don Íñigo López de Mendoza's command. The order was sent in late March 1434, and it's now June 15, 1434.\n\nLet me think about the factors involved:\n\nSuccess Factors:\n- Álvaro de Luna is a competent administrator\n- Don Íñigo López de Mendoza is an experienced commander\n- Castile has strong military infrastructure after the Reconquista\n- The Military Orders are now under crown control\n- The treasury is well-funded\n- Clear orders with specific timeline\n- Sicily (Palermo) is Aragonese territory - friendly port\n\nFailure Factors:\n- Transporting 15,000 men across the Mediterranean is a massive logistical challenge\n- Ships must be gathered, supplies organized\n- Noble levies can be slow to muster\n- Distance from Castile to Palermo is significant\n- Summer heat and disease can affect troops in transit\n- Coordination between Castilian and Aragonese authorities needed\n- Some nobles might drag their feet or send fewer men than promised\n\nLet me draft a table that reflects these factors. The order was given about 2.5 months ago, and the deadline was July 1434 - so we're a few weeks early. The question is: how much of the army has actually assembled?\n\n\nCastilian Relief Army Assembly — d100 Table\n\n\nThe Order (late March 1434):\n\n\n15,000 men (noble levies and crown troops)\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza in overall command\n\nTransport to Sicily; assemble at Palermo by July 1434\n\nSupplies and transport from crown treasury\n\n\nCurrent Date: June 15, 1434 (approximately 2.5 months since order sent)\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna is exceptionally competent administrator\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza is experienced, respected commander\n\nCastile's military infrastructure is strong after the Reconquista\n\nMilitary Orders now under permanent crown control\n\nCrown treasury is well-funded (~229,000 florins projected)\n\nCouncil of Great Houses provides noble cooperation\n\nClear orders with specific timeline and objectives\n\nPalermo is Aragonese territory—friendly reception guaranteed\n\nCastilian nobles are battle-hardened from Granada campaign\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\n15,000 men is an enormous force to transport overseas\n\nRequires gathering ships from across Castile and Aragon\n\nNoble levies can be slow to muster, especially for foreign war\n\nDistance from Castile to Palermo is significant (weeks of sailing)\n\nSummer heat affects men in transit and in camp\n\nSome nobles may send fewer men than promised, or drag their feet\n\nCoordination required between Castilian and Aragonese authorities\n\nSicily must feed and house the assembling army\n\nDisease can spread quickly in crowded camps\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCatastrophic Failure — Something has gone terribly wrong. Ships lost in storms, plague in the camps, or a major noble rebellion in Castile demanding the army's return. Fewer than 5,000 men have reached Palermo, and those present are demoralized and sickly. Months of reorganization needed before any offensive is possible.\n6-15\nSerious Shortfall — The mobilization has struggled. Ship shortages, slow noble responses, and logistical failures mean only 7,000-8,000 men have assembled. Don Íñigo reports he needs at least another month to gather sufficient force. Supplies are adequate but not abundant. The army can defend but cannot yet launch a major campaign.\n16-25\nBehind Schedule — Approximately 10,000 men have reached Palermo—two-thirds of the target. The remainder are still in transit or mustering in Castile. Don Íñigo is competent but frustrated; some nobles sent fewer men than promised, citing harvest concerns or local troubles. The army is capable but under-strength. Full assembly expected by late July.\n26-40\nAdequate but Strained — 12,000 men assembled, with more arriving weekly. The operation has stretched Castilian logistics but not broken them. Some supply shortages—weapons, armor, horses—require local procurement. Don Íñigo reports the army will be ready for operations by early July. Morale is good; the men are eager for battle.\n41-55\nOn Schedule — The full 15,000 men have assembled or are within days of arrival. Álvaro de Luna's organization and Don Íñigo's leadership have overcome the usual delays. Supplies are adequate, morale is high, and the army is ready to move when ordered. A professional, competent mobilization meeting expectations.\n56-70\nExcellent Execution — 15,000 men assembled ahead of schedule, with supplies to spare. Álvaro de Luna's administration performed flawlessly; ships arrived on time, nobles exceeded their quotas, and Sicilian authorities cooperated fully. Don Íñigo reports the army is ready for immediate deployment. Some additional volunteers have arrived—perhaps 1,000-1,500 more than ordered.\n71-80\nExceptional Mobilization — Over 16,000 men assembled, including volunteers inspired by the Reconquista's success. The Council of Great Houses contributed beyond requirements; several nobles came personally to fight. Supplies are abundant—Álvaro secured extra provisions anticipating a long campaign. The army is not just ready but eager. Don Íñigo writes that he has never commanded a finer force.\n81-90\nBeyond Expectations — Nearly 17,000 men, superbly equipped and supplied. The mobilization has become a demonstration of Castilian military power. Veterans of the Granada campaign form the core—experienced, disciplined, battle-hardened. Aragonese observers in Palermo are impressed; word spreads through Italy that the Castilians have arrived in force. René's spies report the numbers with alarm.\n91-95\nOverwhelming Force — 18,000 men, with more still arriving. Castile has poured its strength into this expedition. The Military Orders have contributed heavily; noble houses compete to demonstrate loyalty. The army includes siege engineers, additional artillery, and a substantial cavalry force. Don Íñigo reports that this is the largest Castilian army to leave Iberia in living memory. Italy takes notice.\n96-100\nA Host Assembled — Nearly 20,000 men—Castile has sent everything. The Reconquista veterans form the backbone, supplemented by eager volunteers, Military Order detachments, and noble retinues larger than required. The army is not just a relief force but an invasion force, capable of conquering the entire kingdom of Naples if properly led. Don Íñigo writes simply: \"Give the order, Your Majesty. We are ready to break the world.\"\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

Give me the order and we sail for Naples within the week.\"\n\n\n\nThe Deployment\n\n\nAlfonso immediately dispatches fast galleys to Palermo with your orders:\n\n\nTo Don Íñigo López de Mendoza:\n\n\nBegin embarkation immediately.

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed strategic caution against personal accommodation needs.\n\nJuan is being strategically cautious - he has overwhelming force (20,000 vs 7,000) and doesn't need to take risks. He wants to use superior numbers to force René out of his position without costly assaults. This is smart generalship.\n\nHe's also asking about accommodations for Lucia, who is about 6 months pregnant (due late August/September 1434). He wants her to stay in Naples while he campaigns.\n\nAlfonso should respond to both the strategic approach and the personal request. Let me think about Alfonso's reaction:\n\n1. Strategic approach: Alfonso might be eager for quick action after months of siege, but he's also experienced enough to appreciate Juan's caution. The plan to deploy strength and march René out is sensible - use superior numbers to maneuver, cut supply lines, and force battle on favorable terms or force a retreat.\n\n2. Lucia's accommodations: Alfonso would certainly offer his best. Castel Nuovo is a royal fortress but perhaps not ideal for a pregnant queen. There might be other options - a palazzo in the city, or perhaps Castel dell'Ovo. Alfonso's own wife María (Juan's sister) is not in Naples - she's likely in Aragon or Valencia. So there's no queen currently in residence to host Lucia.\n\nLet me write Alfonso's response.\n\n\nAlfonso nods slowly, absorbing your approach. For a moment, something flickers across his face—impatience, perhaps, after months of being trapped behind walls. But he masters it quickly.\n\n\n\"You're right. We have every advantage. Only a fool throws that away by rushing.\" He taps the map. \"We deploy, we maneuver, we let our numbers speak. René is no fool—he'll see twenty thousand men marching toward him and know the mathematics. Either he fights at a disadvantage of his choosing, or he retreats north and abandons his conquest.\"\n\n\nHe straightens, the tension of months of siege seeming to ease slightly from his shoulders.\n\n\n\"Patience won Granada. It can win Naples.\"\n\n\n\nAt your personal request, Alfonso's expression softens immediately.\n\n\n\"Lucia.\" He shakes his head. \"I should have asked at once. Forgive me—months of siege have made me forget my manners. Of course we will care for her. She is family twice over—my cousin's wife and soon to bear my potential heir, if God wills and your arrangement holds.\"\n\n\nHe considers for a moment.\n\n\n\"Castel Nuovo is secure but... martial. Soldiers everywhere, the smell of war, no proper gardens. Not ideal for a woman six months with child.\" He moves to a window overlooking the bay. \"Castel dell'Ovo is quieter—the old fortress on the island. But isolated, and the climb is difficult.\"\n\n\nHe turns back.\n\n\n\"There is a better option. The Palazzo Caracciolo, near the church of San Giovanni a Carbonara. The Caracciolo family fled to Calabria when René arrived—hedging their bets, the cowards. Their palazzo has been... requisitioned for the crown's use.\" A thin smile. \"It has gardens, a chapel, spacious chambers with views of the bay. Quiet, comfortable, and within the city walls under my protection. My own physicians attend there—good men, experienced with difficult births.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, his voice growing more serious.\n\n\n\"I will assign a guard—fifty men, reliable Aragonese, answerable to Lucia directly. And I will leave word that if anything happens to me in this campaign, she is to be treated as a queen of Aragon until you return. My household will see to her every need.\"\n\n\nAlfonso meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"María—your sister, my wife—is in Valencia. She writes constantly, asking for news, praying for our victory. She would want me to care for Lucia as she would care for her herself. I swear to you, Juan: your wife and child will be safe. Whatever happens in the field, they will be protected.\"\n\n\nHe extends his hand.\n\n\n\"Now. Let us discuss how we destroy René of Anjou, and then you can introduce me to your queen properly. I have not seen Lucia since your wedding, and I understand she has grown formidable in the intervening years.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed Alfonso's conflicting pride against political opportunity.\n\nJuan is asking Alfonso to confirm a regency arrangement that Juan already promised to the Byzantines - without Alfonso's prior consent. This is a significant ask, and I need to think carefully about how Alfonso would react.\n\nLet me consider Alfonso V's position:\n\n**Who is Alfonso V?**\n- King of Aragon, Sicily, Valencia, Sardinia\n- Pursuing the Naples claim for decades\n- Childless after years of marriage to María (Juan's sister)\n- Experienced, proud, sophisticated ruler\n- Recently humbled by military disasters (Ponza, Aversa)\n- Currently depends on Juan's army for survival\n- Has already discussed succession arrangements with Juan\n\n**What does Alfonso want?**\n- Naples secured\n- His dynasty to continue\n- Recognition and legacy\n- Not to be subordinate to anyone\n\n**What has Juan just done?**\n- Committed to his defense unconditionally\n- Arrived with army that will save him\n- Told him \"no truce, only surrender\"\n- Asked for accommodation for Lucia\n- NOW reveals he made commitments on Alfonso's behalf without asking\n\n**The request itself:**\n- Juan promised the Byzantines that Alfonso would be regent for Castile AND \"Defensor Romaniae\" if Juan dies\n- This is HUGE - it would make Alfonso potentially the most powerful Christian monarch\n- But it also binds Alfonso to defend Constantinople - a massive, expensive, dangerous commitment\n- And Juan made this promise WITHOUT asking first\n\n**Alfonso's likely reactions:**\n\nThis is complicated. On one hand:\n- It's an honor - being named regent for Castile and potential Defensor\n- It demonstrates Juan's trust\n- It aligns with their succession discussions\n- Alfonso is already invested in the eastern Mediterranean\n\nOn the other hand:\n- Juan made a commitment on his behalf without asking\n- This binds Alfonso to defend Constantinople - an enormous responsibility\n- It's presumptuous\n- Alfonso might feel manipulated\n- The timing is awkward - Juan needs Alfonso now, is this a bribe?\n\n**Success factors:**\n\n\nI see potential advantages for Alfonso. The arrangement offers significant political benefits: becoming regent for Castile elevates his status, making him the most powerful Christian monarch. Their existing relationship and shared Mediterranean interests provide a foundation for agreement. Juan's direct approach and the protection this offers Alfonso if he dies could be persuasive. His current dependence on Juan's military support might also incline him to accept.\n\n**Potential challenges:**\nHowever, Alfonso's pride could be wounded by Juan's unilateral commitment. The obligation to defend Constantinople represents a substantial financial and military burden. The presumptuous nature of Juan's action might trigger Alfonso's sense of autonomy and independence. His reaction will likely depend on carefully weighing these competing considerations.\n\n\nAlfonso V's Reaction — Analysis\n\n\nWhat Juan has just revealed:\n\n\nHe promised the Byzantines that Alfonso would serve as regent for Castile AND inherit the title of Defensor Romaniae if Juan dies\n\nThis commitment was made WITHOUT Alfonso's prior consent\n\nJuan is now asking Alfonso to confirm after the fact\n\n\nAlfonso's Position:\n\n\nKing of Aragon, Sicily, Valencia, Sardinia\n\nCurrently fighting for Naples, dependent on Juan's army\n\nChildless after years of marriage to María (Juan's sister)\n\nHas already discussed succession with Juan—agreed to wait until after Rome\n\nProud, sophisticated, experienced ruler\n\nRecently humbled by military disasters (Ponza, Aversa)\n\n\nWhat Alfonso Gains:\n\n\nPotential regency over Castile—the largest kingdom in Iberia\n\nTitle of Defensor Romaniae—leadership of the eastern crusade\n\nWould become the most powerful Christian monarch if Juan dies\n\nFormal recognition of his place in the succession\n\nDemonstrates Juan's trust and faith in him\n\n\nWhat Alfonso Must Accept:\n\n\nBinding commitment to defend Constantinople—enormously expensive\n\nResponsibility for raising Juan's son as regent\n\nBeing \"volunteered\" for something this significant without consultation\n\nSubordinate position (regent, not king) potentially for 15+ years\n\nThe Byzantines now have expectations of him personally\n\n\nThe Complicating Factor:\n\n\nJuan made this promise without asking first\n\nThis is presumptuous, even between close allies\n\nAlfonso's pride may be wounded\n\nThe timing is awkward—right when Alfonso desperately needs Juan's army\n\nIs this a gift, a burden, or a manipulation?\n\n\n\nAlfonso V's Reaction — d100 Table\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDeep Offense — Alfonso's expression freezes, then hardens. \"You gave assurances on my behalf. To a foreign emperor. Without asking me.\" His voice is cold, controlled. \"I am not your vassal, Juan. I am not yours to promise.\" He does not reject outright—he needs Juan's army—but the warmth has left the room. The alliance holds, but trust has been damaged. He will need time and careful handling before he discusses this again.\n6-15\nWounded Pride — Alfonso steps back, visibly stung. \"You might have asked me first, cousin. Before telling the Greeks that the King of Aragon would dance to their tune.\" He is not angry so much as hurt. He acknowledges the logic of the arrangement but resents being presented with a fait accompli. He will likely confirm eventually, but he makes clear this was not how allies should treat each other. A shadow falls over the partnership.\n16-25\nCautious Reservation — Alfonso is quiet for a long moment. \"This is... not a small thing you ask. Regency over Castile. The defense of Constantinople. My treasury, my armies, my reign—all potentially bound to obligations I did not choose.\" He does not refuse, but he does not confirm either. He asks for time to consider, to consult with his advisors. The campaign continues, but this matter remains unresolved.\n26-40\nMeasured Acceptance — Alfonso's jaw tightens, but he masters himself. \"I wish you had asked me first. But I understand why you did it—you were there, I was not, and the Greeks needed assurance.\" He sighs heavily. \"Yes. I confirm. If you die, I will serve as regent and defend Constantinople. But Juan—\" His eyes are serious. \"Do not make a habit of committing me to things without my knowledge. We are allies, not master and servant.\" Acceptance, but with clear boundaries drawn.\n41-55\nPragmatic Agreement — Alfonso considers, then nods slowly. \"It is a logical arrangement. The Greeks needed certainty; you gave them the best assurance available. And truthfully—\" A hint of dark humor. \"If you die and leave me regent of Castile, I will have resources enough to defend Constantinople ten times over.\" He extends his hand. \"I confirm. But next time, cousin, a letter first would be appreciated. Even a short one.\" The matter is settled without rancor.\n56-70\nGenuine Understanding — Alfonso's initial surprise gives way to thoughtful consideration. \"You were in Constantinople, surrounded by men who had lost everything and feared losing more. They needed to know that your death would not mean their abandonment.\" He nods slowly. \"I would have done the same, in your position. And truthfully, Juan—I am honored you thought of me.\" He grips your shoulder. \"I confirm. If you fall, I will raise your son and hold your kingdoms and defend the Greeks until the boy comes of age. You have my word.\"\n71-80\nMoved by Trust — Alfonso is silent for a long moment, processing. When he speaks, his voice is rough. \"You trusted me with everything, Juan. Your son. Your kingdom. Your legacy in the East. Before you even asked me.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"María chose well when she pushed for this alliance. You are not just my cousin by marriage—you are my brother in truth.\" He embraces you firmly. \"I confirm. God grant you live to a hundred, but if He calls you home early, I will not fail you or your son.\"\n81-90\nDeeply Honored — Alfonso's eyes widen as the full implications sink in. \"Do you understand what you have done? You have told the last Roman Emperor that the King of Aragon stands behind your word. That if you fall, I carry your banner east.\" His voice is thick with emotion. \"My father spent his life dreaming of crusade and died having accomplished nothing. You have given me the chance to be what he never was—a true defender of Christendom.\" He grips your hand tightly. \"I confirm. With all my heart, I confirm.\"\n91-95\nProfound Commitment — Alfonso stares at you, then laughs—not mockingly, but with something like wonder. \"You magnificent fool. You gave away a regency and an empire without even asking if I wanted them.\" He embraces you roughly. \"Of course I confirm. Did you think I would refuse? Juan, we have spoken of binding our kingdoms together. This does more than words ever could. If you die, your son becomes my son. Your cause becomes my cause. Constantinople becomes my responsibility.\" He steps back, eyes bright. \"We are no longer merely allies. We are one house, one purpose.\"\n96-100\nA Sacred Vow — Alfonso goes very still. When he speaks, his voice carries the weight of something larger than politics. \"You know what this means, don't you? If I confirm, I bind not just myself but Aragon—forever. Your son, raised as my heir until he comes of age. Constantinople, defended with Aragonese blood and gold. The crusade, continued whether you live or die.\" He looks at you with an intensity that borders on fierce. \"I do not confirm, cousin. I swear. Before God and all the saints, I swear that if you fall, I will be father to your children, guardian of your kingdoms, and defender of the East until my last breath. This is not politics. This is holy obligation.\" He draws his sword and kneels, offering you the hilt. \"Witness my oath, Juan. And know that you have bound me tighter than any treaty ever could.\"\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

Alfonso is going to make a sacred vow, kneeling with his sword. This is an incredibly powerful scene that will cement the alliance between Castile and Aragon in a way that transcends politics.\n\nLet me write this scene with the weight it deserves. Alfonso is going to swear a holy oath, binding himself, his kingdom, and his legacy to Juan's cause. This is not just political alliance—this is something sacred, something that will shape the future of both kingdoms and the eastern crusade.\n\nI need to:\n1. Write Alfonso's reaction with appropriate gravitas\n2. Show his emotional transformation as he processes what Juan has done\n3. Have him kneel and offer his sword—a profound gesture of fealty without actually being fealty\n4. Make this a moment that will be remembered\n5. End with Juan needing to respond—but NOT generating Juan's response\n\nThis is a beautiful moment in the campaign. Two kings, bound together by something greater than politics. The 100 roll means this is as good as it could possibly be.\n\n\nA Sacred Vow\n\n\nAlfonso goes very still.\n\n\nThe sounds of the castle—distant footsteps, the cry of gulls, the murmur of soldiers in the courtyard below—seem to fade. For a long moment, the King of Aragon simply looks at you, and something shifts behind his eyes. The politician, the strategist, the desperate king clinging to his besieged capital—all of that falls away, and what remains is something rawer, older.\n\n\n\"Do you understand what you have done?\"\n\n\nHis voice is quiet. Not angry. Not even surprised anymore. Something deeper.\n\n\n\"You stood before the last Roman Emperor, in the city that Constantine built, and you told him: If I fall, the King of Aragon will carry my banner. You pledged my blood, my treasury, my kingdom—everything I am and everything I have—to the defense of Christendom in the East.\"\n\n\nHe takes a slow breath.\n\n\n\"You did not ask me. You did not send a letter. You simply... trusted. Trusted that I would be the man you needed me to be.\"\n\n\nAlfonso moves to the window, looking out over the bay where your carracks ride at anchor beside his galleys. When he speaks again, his voice is rough.\n\n\n\"My father, Fernando, spent his life dreaming of glory. He schemed and fought and bled for thirty years, and what did he leave me? A divided inheritance, a brother who hated me, and wars on every frontier. He dreamed of crusade and died having accomplished nothing but fratricide.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to face you.\n\n\n\"I have been king for eighteen years. I conquered Sicily. I claimed Naples. I built fleets and hired armies and played the great game of Italian politics. And for what?\" He gestures at the scarred walls, the map covered in enemy positions. \"For this. Trapped in a castle, besieged by Frenchmen, watching everything I built crumble.\"\n\n\nHis voice drops.\n\n\n\"I told myself I was building an empire. But I was only building monuments to my own pride. Naples, Sicily, Sardinia—what are they? Pieces on a board. Coins to count. They will forget my name a hundred years from now.\"\n\n\nAlfonso crosses to where his sword hangs on the wall—a magnificent blade, the hilt worked with the arms of Aragon. He lifts it down, holding it across both palms.\n\n\n\"But this—what you offer me—this is something else. This is not politics. This is not alliance. This is purpose.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes, and there are tears in his—tears he does not try to hide.\n\n\n\"If I confirm, I bind not just myself but Aragon. Forever. Your son, raised as my heir until he comes of age. Your kingdoms, governed as sacred trust. Constantinople, defended with Aragonese blood and gold. The crusade—the true crusade, not the petty squabbles of Italian princes—continued whether you live or die.\"\n\n\nHe sinks to one knee.\n\n\nThe King of Aragon—proud Alfonso, who has bent his knee to no man, who defied popes and emperors, who would rather die than submit—kneels before you on the stones of Castel Nuovo.\n\n\nHe offers you the sword, hilt-first.\n\n\n\"I do not merely confirm, cousin. I swear.\"\n\n\nHis voice rings in the empty hall.\n\n\n\"Before God Almighty and all the saints, I swear: If you fall, I will be father to your children and guardian to your kingdoms. I will defend Constantinople as if it were Zaragoza. I will carry the cross east and make war upon the infidel until my last breath. I will raise your son to be a king worthy of both our houses, and when he comes of age, I will place the crown upon his head with my own hands and account to him for every decision I made in his name.\"\n\n\nHis eyes burn into yours.\n\n\n\"This is not treaty. This is not politics. This is holy obligation, sealed before God, witnessed by the blood we share and the cause we serve. I bind myself, my heirs, and my kingdom to this oath. Let God strike me down if I fail it.\"\n\n\nHe bows his head over the offered sword.\n\n\n\"Witness my oath, Juan. And know that you have bound me tighter than any treaty ever could. We are no longer two kingdoms. We are one house, one blood, one purpose. From this day until the world ends.\"\n\n\n\nThe sword gleams in the afternoon light. Alfonso kneels, waiting.\n\n\nThe moment hangs suspended—two kings, two kingdoms, two destinies converging in a dusty hall in a besieged city.\n\n\nOutside, somewhere, René of Anjou waits with his army, unaware that the world has just shifted beneath his feet.\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

Tight. The embrace of brothers, not cousins. Of men who have bound themselves to something larger than either of them.\n\n\nAlfonso holds the embrace for a long moment.

I suspect that is an understatement.\"\n\n\nHe opens the door and gestures for you to lead the way.\n\n\n\"Come. Let us see your queen settled in proper comfort.

This is a nice character moment - let me write this as a warm, human scene that shows the relationships between these characters.\n\nLucia is about 6 months pregnant at this point (she was 5.5 months in Constantinople around May 12-15, and it's now June 15, so she's about 6 months along). She's been through a lot - the voyage to Constantinople, the political intrigues there, the journey back through Rhodes and now Naples.\n\nCatalina is their daughter, nearly 2 years old.\n\nAlfonso is meeting Lucia again - he last saw her at the wedding. He's just made this profound oath to Juan, so he'll view Lucia differently now - as the mother of a child he's sworn to raise if Juan dies.\n\nLet me write a warm scene that:\n1. Shows Alfonso meeting Lucia properly\n2. Shows Lucia's character - she's become formidable\n3. Shows Catalina briefly\n4. Gets them settled in the Palazzo Caracciolo\n5. Sets up the transition to the military campaign\n\n\nThe Queen and the King\n\n\nYou find Lucia in the great cabin of the flagship, directing servants in the organization of trunks and cases. Despite six months of pregnancy and weeks at sea, she moves with purpose, her voice calm but firm as she instructs the household staff.\n\n\nCatalina sits on a cushioned chest nearby, clutching a wooden horse that one of the Hospitaller knights carved for her in Rhodes. She looks up as you enter, her face breaking into a smile.\n\n\n\"Papá!\"\n\n\nLucia turns, one hand resting on the swell of her belly. Her eyes flick from you to Alfonso, assessing, calculating—and then she smiles, warm but measured.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" She offers Alfonso a curtsey, graceful despite her condition. \"Forgive me for not receiving you properly. The sea has made a mess of my household.\"\n\n\nAlfonso steps forward and takes her hand, bowing over it with genuine courtesy.\n\n\n\"Your Highness. The last time we met, you were a bride of sixteen, shy and uncertain in a foreign court.\" He straightens, studying her face. \"María was right. You have become formidable.\"\n\n\nLucia's smile sharpens slightly. \"Formidable is a kind word for what Constantinople makes of a woman, Your Majesty. I have learned to smile at men who would see my husband dead, to make pleasant conversation with traitors, and to sleep soundly on a ship while storms rage outside.\" She glances at you. \"Juan has taught me that queens do not have the luxury of fear.\"\n\n\nAlfonso laughs—a genuine sound, surprised out of him.\n\n\n\"I see why he loves you.\" He releases her hand and crouches down to Catalina's level. \"And this must be the Princess. I am your uncle Alfonso, little one. I knew your father when he was not much older than you.\"\n\n\nCatalina regards him solemnly for a moment, then holds out her wooden horse for inspection.\n\n\n\"Caballo,\" she announces.\n\n\n\"A fine horse,\" Alfonso agrees gravely. \"Does he have a name?\"\n\n\n\"Santiago.\"\n\n\nAlfonso glances up at you, eyebrow raised. \"You are raising a crusader, I see.\"\n\n\n\nThe Palazzo Caracciolo\n\n\nWithin the hour, a small procession makes its way through the streets of Naples—Lucia in a covered litter, Catalina in the arms of her nurse, your household guard forming a protective ring. The people of Naples watch from doorways and windows, curious, hopeful. Word has spread: the King of Castile has arrived with an army. The siege may finally be broken.\n\n\nThe Palazzo Caracciolo is everything Alfonso promised. A graceful building of honey-colored stone, set back from the street behind a walled garden. Orange trees line the entrance; a fountain plays in the courtyard. The rooms are spacious and airy, with tall windows overlooking the Bay of Naples.\n\n\nLucia walks through the chambers slowly, one hand trailing along the walls, the other resting on her belly. She pauses at a window, looking out at the blue water, the distant shape of Vesuvius hazy in the summer heat.\n\n\n\"It's beautiful,\" she says quietly. \"After Constantinople... after the darkness and the fear and the politics... this feels like paradise.\"\n\n\nShe turns to you.\n\n\n\"How long will you be gone?\"\n\n\nThe question is simple, but her eyes hold everything she is not saying. The campaign. The battle to come. The possibility—always the possibility—that you might not return.\n\n\n\nAlfonso has been speaking with the household steward, arranging guards, supplies, physicians. Now he approaches, his manner gentle.\n\n\n\"Your Highness, I have assigned fifty of my best men to your protection. They answer to you directly—not to me, not to any other commander. If you need anything, you have only to ask.\" He pauses. \"And I have given orders throughout the household: if anything happens in the field, you are to be treated as a queen of Aragon. My own sister could expect no better care.\"\n\n\nLucia studies him for a moment, then inclines her head.\n\n\n\"Thank you, Your Majesty. Juan has told me of your oath.\" Her voice softens. \"I know what it cost you to make it. And I know what it means for my children.\"\n\n\nAlfonso's expression flickers—surprise, perhaps, that Juan has already told her.\n\n\n\"Your husband trusts you with everything,\" he observes.\n\n\n\"Yes,\" Lucia says simply. \"He does.\"\n\n\nShe reaches out and takes Alfonso's hand—a familiar gesture, almost sisterly.\n\n\n\"Bring him back to me, cousin. And bring yourself back too. I do not wish to test your oath so soon.\"\n\n\n\nLater, as the sun sets over Naples and the household settles into its new home, Lucia finds you in the garden. Catalina has been put to bed; the servants have been dismissed. It is just the two of you, alone for the first time in days.\n\n\nShe takes your hand and places it on her belly. Beneath your palm, you feel movement—a kick, strong and insistent.\n\n\n\"Your son is restless,\" she says. \"He knows his father is about to go to war.\"\n\n\nThe garden is quiet. The fountain murmurs. Somewhere in the distance, church bells ring the evening hour.\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say?"

A large French force catches a Castilian contingent during disembarkation, inflicting severe casualties before they can form up. Hundreds dead, chaos at the harbor, and a transport ship burned. Meanwhile, Lucia falls ill—fever, possibly related to the pregnancy. Physicians are worried. The campaign and your family both in crisis simultaneously.\n6-10\nSerious Setback — A major cavalry probe goes wrong. French knights ambush the patrol in force; Don Fadrique barely escapes with his life, losing 200 men killed or captured. René parades the prisoners before Aversa's walls. Meanwhile, the summer heat delays transport—ships' crews falling sick, crossings taking longer than planned. Army assembly falls behind schedule. Morale shaken.\n11-20\nCostly Probing — The cavalry encounters stiffer resistance than expected. René has positioned his forces well; every probe is met with organized response. Several skirmishes cost you 50-100 men total with little intelligence gained. The French know your strength now as well as you know theirs. Meanwhile, Lucia is uncomfortable in the heat but healthy. Army arrives on schedule but tired from the crossings.\n21-30\nTense Stalemate — The army assembles without major incident, but probing reveals René's position is stronger than hoped. He has fortified Aversa well and positioned screening forces on every approach. No easy path to force battle on favorable terms. Calabrian barons remain uncommitted, watching. Meanwhile, Catalina struggles to adjust to the new home—nightmares, crying for Constantinople. Lucia manages but is exhausted.\n31-40\nSlow Progress — Everything takes longer than planned. Transport ships delayed by contrary winds. Cavalry probes inconclusive—René's screen is effective. The army assembles by month's end but supplies are strained by the delays. Intelligence suggests René is also receiving trickles of reinforcement from the north. A race is developing. Lucia and Catalina settle adequately; no complications but no comforts either.\n41-55\nSteady Preparation — The army arrives on schedule across multiple crossings. Cavalry probing reveals René's dispositions: approximately 7,000 men concentrated around Aversa, screening forces on the roads, supply lines running north toward Rome. No major engagements—both sides feeling each other out. Lucia settles well into Palazzo Caracciolo; physicians report the pregnancy progresses normally. Catalina begins to smile again.\n56-70\nFavorable Development — Army assembly proceeds smoothly; final contingents arrive ahead of schedule. Cavalry probing succeeds in mapping René's positions and identifying weaknesses—his eastern flank is thinly held, his supply situation worse than expected. Two minor skirmishes go in your favor, taking prisoners who provide useful intelligence. René's army shows signs of strain. Lucia blooms in the Neapolitan sun; the household runs smoothly.\n71-80\nAdvantageous Position — Everything goes right. The army assembles in good order, well-supplied and eager. Cavalry dominates the countryside—René's foragers and scouts driven back, his intelligence blinded. A successful raid captures a supply convoy heading for Aversa. Calabrian barons send quiet messages: they are ready to declare for Alfonso when battle is joined. Lucia reports the baby kicks strongly; physicians say all is well.\n81-90\nStrategic Opportunity — Don Fadrique's cavalry wins a sharp engagement against French screening forces, killing a minor Angevin commander and scattering two hundred men. René pulls his forces closer to Aversa, ceding the countryside. Intelligence reports disease is ravaging the French camp—hundreds sick, dozens dying weekly. The initiative is yours. Meanwhile, Lucia has become a popular figure in Naples; the people bring gifts for the coming prince.\n91-95\nRené Wavers — Probing reveals the French position is crumbling. Desertions mounting daily—Italian mercenaries slipping away, even some French knights departing for home. René's supply situation is desperate; Genoese support has dried up entirely. A captured dispatch reveals René has written to his brother in France begging for reinforcements that may never come. Your army is assembled, rested, and ready. Lucia thrives; Catalina has made friends among the Aragonese children at court.\n96-100\nThe Balance Tips — Before you can even complete your deployment, the situation transforms. Sforza sends a secret envoy: he will switch sides, bringing 3,000 condottieri, if the price is right. Two Calabrian barons openly declare for Alfonso, bringing 800 men. René's camp is swept by fever; his best commander, the Duke of Calabria, dies of illness. The French army begins to disintegrate. René sends another envoy—no longer offering truce, but asking terms for withdrawal. Meanwhile, Lucia feels the baby quicken; she says she dreamed of a son crowned in a great cathedral. Victory is within reach.\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

Captain Fernán coordinates the transport ships like a conductor leading an orchestra—vessels arriving, unloading, departing for the next contingent, day after day. By the end of the second week, the full strength of Castile stands on Neapolitan soil.\n\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza rides into Naples at the head of the final column, his banner snapping in the summer breeze. He dismounts before Castel Nuovo and kneels to you in the courtyard, dusty from the road but grinning fiercely.\n\n\n\"Fifteen thousand men, Your Majesty. Ready to fight. Ready to win.\" He rises, clasping your arm. \"The men have spoken of nothing else since we left Palermo. They say we will do to the French what we did to the Moors.\"\n\n\nThe army makes camp in the fields east of Naples—a sea of tents, cookfires, and banners stretching toward the hills. The veterans of Granada form the backbone: hard men, tanned and scarred, who have seen worse than anything René of Anjou can offer. The newer levies look to them for guidance and find confidence in their steady calm.\n\n\nFinal Strength:\n\n\nCombined Castilian-Aragonese forces: approximately 19,000 men\n\nRené's estimated strength: approximately 6,500-7,000 men (reduced by disease and desertion)\n\n\n\nCavalry Operations\n\n\nDon Fadrique takes the jinetes out within days of your arrival—light cavalry sweeping through the countryside in probing raids, mapping roads, identifying French positions, testing reactions.\n\n\nThe results exceed expectations.\n\n\nRené has pulled his screening forces close to Aversa, unwilling to risk them against superior numbers. Your cavalry owns the countryside. Peasants emerge from hiding to sell food to your foragers; local priests share what they know of French movements; even minor nobles begin making quiet contact, hedging their bets.\n\n\nTwo skirmishes punctuate the reconnaissance:\n\n\nJune 22 — The Acerra Road:\nA French patrol of perhaps sixty men-at-arms encounters Don Fadrique's advance guard. The jinetes feign retreat, drawing the French into a pursuit—then wheel and strike from three directions when Castilian crossbowmen emerge from an olive grove. Thirty French killed or captured, the rest scattered. Castilian losses: eight men.\n\n\nJune 27 — The Capua Bridge:\nA larger engagement. Two hundred French cavalry attempting to escort a supply convoy are intercepted by Don Fadrique's full strength. The French fight hard—their heavy cavalry is formidable—but numbers tell. The convoy is captured: grain, salt pork, wine, and most valuable of all, dispatches.\n\n\nThe dispatches reveal much:\n\n\n\"...fever spreads through the camp without mercy. We bury ten men each day, and twice that number lie sick. The Italian captains grow restless; several have departed without leave. I beg Your Grace to send reinforcement, or at least gold to hold what men remain. The Castilians grow stronger while we wither...\"\n\n\nRené's army is bleeding.\n\n\n\nIntelligence Picture\n\n\nBy month's end, you have a clear view of the enemy:\n\n\nFrench Dispositions:\n\n\nMain force concentrated at Aversa: ~5,000 men (down from 7,000)\n\nScreening forces on northern approaches: ~1,000 men\n\nGarrisons in captured towns: ~500 men scattered\n\nDisease has killed or incapacitated perhaps 800-1,000 since spring\n\n\nFrench Condition:\n\n\nMorale deteriorating—desertions increasing weekly\n\nSupply situation strained—your cavalry has interdicted foraging\n\nGenoese support has dried up (no ships, no gold)\n\nMilanese subsidies reduced (Visconti hedging his bets)\n\nRené has written to France for help, but none has arrived\n\n\nFrench Strengths:\n\n\nAversa is well-fortified; a direct assault would be costly\n\nFrench heavy cavalry remains dangerous in open battle\n\nRené himself is no fool—he will not fight at a disadvantage if he can avoid it\n\nThe road north to Rome remains open; he can retreat if pressed\n\n\n\nThe Palazzo Caracciolo\n\n\nWhile the army gathers and the cavalry rides, life continues at the palazzo.\n\n\nLucia blooms in the Neapolitan summer. The sea air agrees with her; the physicians report the pregnancy progresses perfectly. The baby is active, kicking strongly, positioned well. \"A healthy boy,\" the chief physician predicts, though he is careful to add that only God knows for certain.\n\n\nShe has taken to walking in the garden each evening, one hand on her belly, watching the sun set over the bay. Sometimes you join her, stealing an hour from the endless councils and dispatches. Sometimes she walks alone, lost in thought.\n\n\nCatalina adjusts slowly. The palazzo is strange, the servants speak differently, and she misses the great dome of Hagia Sophia that she could see from the ship. But children are resilient. By the second week, she has claimed a corner of the garden as her own, where she builds elaborate fortresses from stones and sticks and commands imaginary armies in battles only she understands.\n\n\n\"She is her father's daughter,\" Lucia observes one evening, watching Catalina marshal her pebble soldiers. \"Already conquering kingdoms.\"\n\n\n\nAlfonso's Assessment\n\n\nNear the end of June, you meet with Alfonso and your commanders in the great hall of Castel Nuovo. Maps cover the table; pins mark positions; wine sits untouched as the discussion turns serious.\n\n\n\"René is weaker than we hoped, but not broken,\" Alfonso summarizes. \"He knows we outnumber him nearly three to one. He will not offer open battle—he would be destroyed. His only choices are to hold Aversa and pray for relief from France, or retreat north and abandon his conquest.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo studies the map. \"If we march on Aversa directly, he retreats. If we try to encircle, he retreats. We can take the city, but we cannot trap his army unless he makes a mistake.\"\n\n\n\"Then we make him make a mistake,\" Don Fadrique suggests. \"Threaten his line of retreat. Force him to fight for the road north, or lose it.\"\n\n\nAlfonso nods slowly. \"It could work. But if we move too aggressively, he slips away entirely. Better to let him escape than to leave him an army-in-being behind us.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you.\n\n\n\"We have the strength to win, Juan. The question is how—and how completely. Do we want René destroyed, or merely expelled? A broken French army sends a message to all of Italy. A retreating French army might return in a year with reinforcements.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan do? How does Juan want to proceed with the campaign?"

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed tactical feasibility of surprise encirclement against medieval military realities.\n\nJuan is asking good tactical questions about whether they can achieve surprise and pin René in Aversa before he can retreat. Let me think through this realistically:\n\n1. Can they achieve surprise?\n- They control the countryside with cavalry\n- But Aversa is only 15 miles from Naples\n- René would have scouts and lookouts\n- A 19,000-man army cannot move secretly - the dust, noise, and time required to break camp and march would be visible for miles\n- Even if they control the countryside, René likely has agents in Naples itself, or can see movement from Aversa's walls/towers\n\n2. Can they pin him in the fort?\n- Aversa has multiple gates/exits\n- To truly encircle it would require splitting the army\n- René could concentrate and punch through a thin encirclement\n- The road north to Rome is his escape route - they'd need to cut it first\n- But cutting the road first means marching past Aversa, exposing their flank\n\n3. What would a realistic medieval commander say?\n- Alfonso and the experienced commanders would know these limitations\n- They'd explain why surprise is difficult with such a large force\n- But they might propose alternatives - night march, feint, etc.\n\nLet me have Alfonso and the commanders engage with Juan's questions realistically, explaining the challenges but also exploring possibilities.\n\n\nAlfonso and Don Íñigo exchange glances. It's a good question—the kind of question that separates clever commanders from merely competent ones.\n\n\nDon Fadrique speaks first, tracing routes on the map.\n\n\n\"We control the countryside, yes. My jinetes have driven his patrols back to within a mile of Aversa's walls. His foragers cannot move without being shadowed; his scouts are blind.\" He taps the fortress. \"But there are limits to what cavalry screens can achieve.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo picks up the thread, his voice measured.\n\n\n\"Nineteen thousand men do not move invisibly, Your Majesty. When we break camp and march, the dust alone will be visible for miles. The noise of that many men, horses, wagons—it carries. Even if René has no scouts in the field, he has eyes on his walls. Towers. Church steeples. The moment we form column and move north, he will know.\"\n\n\nAlfonso nods, but he's studying the map with renewed interest.\n\n\n\"That said...\" He traces the distance with his finger. \"Aversa is fifteen miles from Naples. A forced march—leaving at night, moving fast—could cover that distance in six hours, perhaps seven. If we time it right, we arrive at dawn. René would have warning, yes, but how much? An hour? Two?\"\n\n\n\"Not enough time to organize a full retreat,\" Don Fadrique adds, catching the thread. \"Breaking camp for seven thousand men, even in disorder, takes time. Wagons must be loaded, horses saddled, units formed. If we are at his gates by sunrise...\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo strokes his beard thoughtfully. \"The question is whether we can encircle before he punches through. Aversa has multiple gates. The road north is his escape route. To truly pin him, we would need to cut that road before we invest the walls—but that means splitting our forces, sending a blocking force north while the main army advances.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\n\"It is possible, Your Majesty. Difficult, but possible. A night march, cavalry racing ahead to cut the northern road, the main army arriving at dawn to complete the encirclement.\" He pauses. \"But if René reacts faster than we expect—if he has warning we don't anticipate—we could find ourselves with a divided army facing a concentrated enemy. That is how battles are lost.\"\n\n\n\nAlfonso leans over the map, his eyes sharp.\n\n\n\"Let us think through the possibilities.\"\n\n\nHe begins sketching positions with tokens:\n\n\nOption One: Direct Advance\n\"We march on Aversa in force, in daylight, making no attempt at surprise. René sees us coming, retreats north. We take Aversa without a fight, liberate the surrounding territory, and pursue at our leisure. Safe, but he escapes with his army intact.\"\n\n\nOption Two: Night March and Dawn Investment\n\"We break camp after dark, march through the night, arrive at Aversa at first light. Cavalry races ahead to cut the northern road. If it works, René is trapped—forced to fight or surrender. If it fails, we've exhausted our army with a night march and potentially divided our forces.\"\n\n\nOption Three: The Lure\n\"We send a portion of our army north, openly, as if to cut René's retreat. He must respond—either retreat immediately, or sortie to keep the road open. Either way, he moves, and we can bring our full strength against him in the open rather than behind walls.\"\n\n\nDon Fadrique adds a fourth possibility:\n\n\nOption Four: Strangulation\n\"We do nothing hasty. We tighten the noose day by day. Cut every road, intercept every supply convoy, let disease and hunger do our work. In a month, perhaps two, his army disintegrates without a battle. But this takes time—and every week is another week for French reinforcements to arrive.\"\n\n\n\nAlfonso straightens, looking at you.\n\n\n\"You asked if we can pin him in his fort. The answer is: possibly, if we are bold and lucky. The night march is our best chance at surprise—but it is a gamble.\"\n\n\nHe gestures at the assembled commanders.\n\n\n\"You have led armies, Juan. You broke the Moors at Alcalá with deception and timing. What does your instinct tell you? Do we gamble on trapping René, or do we grind him down slowly and accept that he may escape?\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan decide?"

This way:\n\n1. The army stays concentrated (not divided)\n2. The infantry near the fort but blocking the northern route forces René into a dilemma\n3. If René tries to retreat, he has to march past a hostile army - very dangerous\n4. If René stays, he's besieged by a superior force\n\nThis is a sound tactical approach. Let me think through how the commanders would react and then we need to draft a d100 table for the night march and deployment.\n\nThe key elements:\n- Night march of 15 miles with 19,000 men\n- Arrive at dawn\n- Deploy the main force (especially infantry) to threaten the northern road\n- Not dividing the army - keeping it concentrated\n- Fresh, well-rested troops in good spirits\n\nSuccess factors:\n- Troops are fresh and eager\n- Good morale\n- Experienced commanders\n- Control of countryside means less risk of ambush\n- René's scouts are blind\n- 15 miles is manageable for a night march\n- Veterans of Granada know how to march\n\nFailure factors:\n- 19,000 men moving at night is inherently chaotic\n- Units can get lost, separated\n- Night marches are exhausting\n- If something goes wrong, darkness makes it worse\n- René might have hidden observers\n- Local informants might warn him\n- The terrain might cause problems\n\nLet me draft the table.\n\n\nDon Íñigo's eyes light up. He sees it immediately.\n\n\n\"Yes. Yes.\" He moves tokens on the map, positioning them north of Aversa, astride the road to Capua. \"We don't need to surround him completely. We just need to make retreat costly. If our infantry is here—\" he places the block firmly on the northern road, \"—then any withdrawal becomes a fighting retreat. His baggage train, his sick, his artillery—all of it vulnerable to our cavalry while his rearguard fights to keep us off.\"\n\n\nDon Fadrique nods vigorously. \"And if he tries to punch through with his cavalry, he leaves his infantry behind. We destroy them piecemeal. If he stays in Aversa, we besiege him with overwhelming force. Every choice is bad for him.\"\n\n\nAlfonso studies the deployment, then smiles slowly—the smile of a man who has spent months with no good options, suddenly seeing a path to victory.\n\n\n\"It's elegant. You threaten his retreat without dividing your strength. He cannot ignore you, cannot outrun you, cannot outfight you.\" He looks up at you. \"The night march is the key. If we arrive at dawn with our full force deployed across his escape route, he wakes to find the jaws already closing.\"\n\n\n\nDon Íñigo turns to practicalities, his commander's mind working through the details.\n\n\n\"Fifteen miles in darkness. We'll need guides who know the roads—local men, or our cavalry scouts who've been mapping the terrain for weeks. The infantry marches in column; we sacrifice speed for cohesion. No torches except at the head and tail of each regiment—enough to keep formation, not enough to announce our presence.\"\n\n\n\"The cavalry?\" Don Fadrique asks.\n\n\n\"Screens on all sides,\" Don Íñigo replies. \"Your jinetes know the ground. They move ahead, clearing any French stragglers, ensuring no warning reaches Aversa. The heavy cavalry stays with the main column—we'll need them fresh if René decides to fight at dawn.\"\n\n\nHe calculates silently.\n\n\n\"If we break camp at midnight, we reach Aversa by first light—six hours march, with time to deploy before full sunrise. The men will be tired but not exhausted. And the prospect of catching the French in their beds will keep them moving.\"\n\n\nAlfonso turns to you.\n\n\n\"When do we march, Juan? Tonight? Tomorrow night? The moon waxes gibbous—enough light to march by, not enough to be seen at distance. The weather has been clear; the roads are dry.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then adds quietly:\n\n\n\"Every day we wait, René might receive warning. Might prepare. Might slip away in the night himself. If we are going to do this, we should do it soon.\"\n\n\n\nDoes Juan order the night march for tonight, tomorrow, or does he want more preparation time? And shall we draft a d100 table for the execution of the march and dawn deployment?"

A regiment takes a wrong turn in the darkness and marches miles out of the way. The creek crossing becomes a nightmare—wagons stuck, men falling in, chaos spreading down the column. By dawn, the army is strung out over eight miles, exhausted, disordered, and nowhere near its objective. Hours needed to reassemble. The element of surprise is utterly lost.\n6-10\nSerious Problems — The march bogs down repeatedly. The creek crossing takes twice as long as planned; units bunch up behind it, then gaps open as they try to catch up. Two regiments become separated in the darkness and do not rejoin until after sunrise. The army arrives late—mid-morning, not dawn—tired and disorganized. Deployment takes hours longer than planned.\n11-20\nSignificant Delays — The march proceeds but slower than hoped. The creek crossing causes a two-hour delay; the rear regiments are still marching when the sun rises. The army arrives in the early morning rather than at first light, and the men are more fatigued than expected. Deployment is possible but rushed. The supply train falls far behind; hot food will not arrive for hours.\n21-30\nMinor Problems — Most of the army arrives on schedule, but one regiment—perhaps 1,500 men—becomes lost in the darkness and arrives an hour late. Some straggling in the rear units; perhaps 500 men need time to catch up. The creek crossing causes delays but is managed. The army can deploy but is not at full strength immediately. Men are tired but functional.\n31-40\nAdequate Execution — The march proceeds without major incident but with the usual friction of night operations. Some bunching at the creek, some straggling in the rear, some confusion at crossroads. The army arrives approximately on schedule—dawn, give or take half an hour. Men are tired but in reasonable order. Deployment proceeds as planned, if not perfectly.\n41-55\nSolid Performance — Don Fadrique's preparation pays off. The guides keep the column moving; the creek crossing is handled efficiently; the regiments maintain cohesion. The army arrives at first light in good order, ready to deploy. The men are tired but their spirits are high—they know they have accomplished something difficult. The supply train arrives on schedule with hot food.\n56-70\nExcellent Execution — The march is a model of military efficiency. Every unit reaches its position on time; the creek crossing flows smoothly; straggling is minimal. The army deploys north of Aversa as the first light breaks the eastern horizon, exactly as planned. The men are tired but exhilarated—Granada veterans nod approvingly at the newer troops. Hot food reaches them as they take their positions.\n71-80\nOutstanding March — Everything works. The column moves like a single organism through the darkness, guides calling softly at every turn, sergeants keeping their men closed up. The creek crossing is passed so smoothly it barely slows the advance. The army arrives ahead of schedule, with time to rest and eat before full deployment. The men are in excellent spirits, confident in their commanders and themselves.\n81-90\nNear Perfect — Don Íñigo will later call it the finest night march of his career. Nineteen thousand men move fifteen miles in darkness without losing a single regiment, without a single major delay, arriving in perfect order before dawn. The deployment unfolds exactly as planned—infantry astride the northern road, cavalry on the flanks, artillery positioning for bombardment. The men are fresh enough to fight immediately if needed. The supply train arrives with hot porridge and wine as the sun rises.\n91-95\nExceptional Achievement — The march becomes the stuff of legend. The army flows through the night like water, silent and unstoppable. They arrive so early that the forward units have time to dig basic fieldworks before dawn. Every man is fed, every unit in position, every commander knowing exactly where his troops stand. Veterans who marched with the great captains of the past say they have never seen better. The army is not just ready—it is eager.\n96-100\nFlawless Execution — It is as if God Himself guides the column. Not a single man lost, not a single wagon stuck, not a single unit out of position. The army arrives in the pre-dawn darkness with time to spare, deploys in perfect battle order, and stands ready as the first rays of sunlight illuminate Aversa's walls. The men have marched fifteen miles through the night and stand fresher than they have any right to be—fed, watered, armed, and burning to fight. Don Íñigo embraces you when it is done: \"Your Majesty, I have commanded men for thirty years. I have never seen anything like this.\"\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

The roll of 62 for the march means \"Excellent Execution\" - the army arrives at first light in good order, ready to deploy, with minimal issues.\n\nThis excellent march should factor into the French response table - a well-executed march gives them less warning, less time to react.\n\nI need to think about:\n1. How might René detect the approaching army?\n2. What are his options once detected?\n3. How does the quality of Juan's march affect this?\n\nFrench detection methods:\n- Scouts/pickets in the field (but these have been driven back)\n- Observers on walls/towers\n- Sound of marching army\n- Dust clouds (less at night)\n- Local informants/spies\n- Deserters from Juan's army\n\nFrench response options:\n- Full retreat north immediately\n- Partial evacuation (save what they can)\n- Sortie to disrupt deployment\n- Dig in and prepare for siege\n- Attempt to negotiate\n- Panic and disorder\n\nWith Juan's roll of 62 (Excellent Execution), the French should have LESS warning than average. The march was efficient, quiet, on schedule. This should shift the probabilities toward favorable outcomes for Juan.\n\nLet me draft this table with the march quality factored in.\n\n\nFrench Detection and Response — d100 Table\n\n\nContext: The Castilian army has executed an excellent night march (Roll: 62). They arrive at first light in good order, deploying north of Aversa astride the road to Capua. The march was efficient, quiet, and on schedule.\n\n\nFrench Situation:\n\n\nApproximately 6,500 men in and around Aversa\n\nArmy weakened by disease, desertion, low morale\n\nScouts and foragers driven back by Castilian cavalry dominance\n\nIntelligence capability severely degraded\n\nRené is no fool, but his options are limited\n\n\nDetection Variables:\n\n\nHow early do French pickets spot the approaching column?\n\nHow quickly does warning reach René?\n\nHow much time does he have to react?\n\n\nResponse Variables:\n\n\nDoes René attempt to retreat?\n\nDoes he prepare to defend?\n\nDoes he sortie to disrupt deployment?\n\nDoes his army hold together or begin to fracture?\n\n\nFactors Favoring Juan (due to excellent march):\n\n\nArmy moved quietly and efficiently through the night\n\nCavalry screens neutralized or avoided French pickets\n\nArrival at first light gives minimal warning\n\nFrench scouts have been blind for weeks\n\n\nFactors Favoring René:\n\n\nExperienced commander, will react quickly to crisis\n\nFrench heavy cavalry could punch through if committed early\n\nAversa's walls provide fallback position\n\nNorthern road still technically open at march's end\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nRené Forewarned — Despite the excellent march, a French patrol escapes the cavalry screen and races to Aversa with warning. René, already suspicious, had his army sleeping in marching order. By the time you arrive at dawn, the French are gone—retreating north in good order, rearguard covering the withdrawal. You take Aversa without a fight, but René's army escapes intact. The campaign continues, but the trap has failed.\n6-10\nFighting Retreat — French pickets spot the approaching column an hour before dawn and raise the alarm. René reacts with impressive speed—rousing his army, forming column, and beginning withdrawal north. Your vanguard arrives as his rearguard is leaving. A running battle develops on the Capua road; you inflict casualties (500-800 French killed or captured) but the bulk of his army escapes. A victory, but not a decisive one.\n11-20\nPartial Escape — The alarm reaches René perhaps thirty minutes before your arrival. Chaos in the French camp—some units form and retreat north, others are caught half-ready. René himself escapes with his cavalry and perhaps 3,000 infantry, but he is forced to abandon his baggage train and siege equipment. The remaining French (2,000-2,500 men) are trapped in Aversa. A significant victory; René's army is halved and demoralized.\n21-30\nDisordered Retreat Attempted — René receives warning at first light, just as your infantry begins deploying across the northern road. He attempts an immediate breakout with his cavalry, hoping to punch through before your lines solidify. A sharp engagement ensues at the crossroads north of town. The outcome depends on whether your deployment is complete—roll a follow-up engagement if desired, or resolve narratively.\n31-40\nSurprise Achieved, Reaction Swift — The French have no warning until your army appears on the horizon at dawn. René is caught unprepared but reacts quickly—fortifying Aversa, pulling all forces inside the walls, preparing for siege rather than attempting flight. He calculates that your blocking position makes retreat too risky. The French army is trapped but intact behind walls. A siege begins.\n41-55\nConfusion in the French Camp — Your arrival at dawn catches the French completely off guard. Sentries on the walls spot your deployment and raise the alarm, but it is already too late. René faces an impossible choice: retreat through your lines (suicidal), or defend Aversa with a demoralized, disease-ridden army. He chooses defense, but panic spreads through the camp. Desertions begin within hours—men slipping over the walls, surrendering to your pickets. The siege will be short.\n56-70\nComplete Surprise — The first the French know of your presence is the sight of nineteen thousand men deploying across their escape route as the sun rises. René emerges from his quarters to find his army already surrounded in all but name. The southern approach remains technically open, but retreating toward Naples means marching into Alfonso's garrison. He is trapped. French morale collapses visibly—men weeping, officers arguing, the first white flags appearing on the walls before noon.\n71-80\nShock and Paralysis — Your army materializes like a vengeful apparition in the dawn mist. The French sentries do not even raise the alarm immediately—they stand frozen, unable to process what they are seeing. By the time René is roused, your infantry is entrenched across the Capua road and your cavalry is completing the encirclement. The French army simply stops functioning as a coherent force. Unit cohesion dissolves; men begin surrendering individually and in groups. René retreats to the citadel with his household, but the army outside the walls is already lost.\n81-90\nFrench Army Disintegrates — The night march achieves total surprise. René wakes to find his army surrounded, his escape route cut, and his men already surrendering in droves. The Italian mercenaries throw down their weapons within the hour; the Provençal infantry follows by midday. Only the French knights hold together, retreating to the citadel with René. By nightfall, 4,000 men have surrendered. René holds out with perhaps 1,500 loyal troops, but it is only a matter of time.\n91-95\nCapitulation Begins — Your deployment is so swift, so overwhelming, that resistance becomes unthinkable. French officers ride out under white flag before your lines are even fully formed, seeking terms. René's army is surrendering faster than you can process prisoners. By noon, only the citadel holds out—René and a few hundred household knights, surrounded by their own surrendered army. Envoys arrive asking what terms you will offer. The campaign is effectively over.\n96-100\nTotal Collapse — The French army ceases to exist as a fighting force the moment your banners appear. Men stream out of Aversa's gates in their nightshirts, throwing down weapons, begging for quarter. French knights—proud nobles who rode south to win a kingdom—kneel in the mud before Castilian sergeants. René himself is nearly captured when his own guards refuse to fight; he escapes to the citadel with only his personal household, perhaps 200 men. By midday, you have captured the entire French army—6,000 men, including a dozen nobles worth ransoms that will pay for the campaign twice over. René is alone, besieged, broken. The war is over.\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

René has time to rouse his army, assess the situation, and make a deliberate decision. He chooses to attempt retreat north before the Castilian infantry can block the road. His army is forming column and preparing to march as your vanguard arrives.\n11-20\nWarning at First Light — French pickets spot the approaching column approximately one hour before your deployment is complete. René is roused and quickly assesses the situation. He sees the northern road is not yet fully blocked and chooses to attempt an immediate breakout with his cavalry leading, hoping to punch through before your lines solidify.\n21-30\nLate Warning, Aggressive Response — Sentries on Aversa's walls spot your army as it begins deploying at dawn. René has perhaps 30-45 minutes to react. Rather than waiting to be encircled, he chooses to sortie with his cavalry to disrupt your deployment and buy time for his infantry to form up. He will attempt to fight his way out if the sortie creates an opening.\n31-40\nLate Warning, Defensive Response — Your army is spotted at dawn as deployment begins. René quickly calculates that retreat through your lines is too risky with his weakened, disorganized force. He chooses to defend Aversa, pulling all forces inside the walls and preparing for siege. He hopes to hold out for relief from France or negotiate terms from a position of strength.\n41-55\nSurprise Achieved, Hesitation — The French have no warning until your army appears on the horizon at first light. René is caught unprepared and uncertain. He hesitates, unable to decide between retreat, defense, or negotiation. Precious time is lost as he consults with his officers, who give conflicting advice. His army awaits orders that do not come quickly.\n56-70\nSurprise Achieved, Paralysis — Your arrival at dawn catches the French completely off guard. René emerges to find your deployment already underway across his escape route. He recognizes that retreat is now extremely dangerous and defense may be futile with his demoralized army. He makes no immediate decision, retreating to council with his closest advisors while his army mills in confusion, awaiting orders.\n71-80\nComplete Surprise, Demoralization — The French sentries freeze in disbelief at the sight of your army materializing at dawn. By the time René is informed, your deployment is nearly complete. He assesses his options and finds them all bad. He sends envoys to request a parley, hoping to negotiate terms while he still has an army to bargain with. His men await the outcome, morale crumbling.\n81-90\nTotal Surprise, Loss of Control — René wakes to find your army already deployed across his escape route. Before he can issue orders, panic spreads through his camp. Italian mercenaries begin discussing surrender; French officers argue loudly about what to do. René struggles to impose order on an army that is fracturing around him. Whatever he decides, he must first regain control of his own forces.\n91-95\nShock, Army Fragmenting — Your deployment is so swift and overwhelming that René's command structure begins to fail before he can react. Unit commanders begin acting independently—some preparing to surrender, some fortifying positions, some demanding retreat. René's orders compete with chaos. He no longer fully controls his army's response; different units may react differently to your approach.\n96-100\nCommand Collapse — The sight of nineteen thousand men appearing at dawn breaks something in the French army. René's authority evaporates. Officers ignore his orders; men look to their immediate commanders or to themselves. The army has not yet surrendered, but it has ceased to function as a unified force under René's command. What happens next depends entirely on what terms you offer and to whom—René is no longer the only person who can decide.\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

He's attempting an immediate breakout with cavalry leading, trying to punch through before the Castilian lines solidify.\n\nI need to describe what Juan sees and is made aware of as this unfolds. This is the moment of crisis - René is making his move. I should describe:\n1. The march completing successfully (roll 62 - excellent execution)\n2. The deployment beginning at dawn\n3. The moment Juan becomes aware that the French have spotted them and are reacting\n4. What Juan can see of René's response - cavalry forming, movement toward the northern road\n\nI should NOT resolve whether René succeeds - that's for Juan to respond to and potentially roll for.\n\n\nDawn at Aversa — July 2, 1434\n\n\nThe march has been everything you hoped for. Fifteen miles through the darkness, the column flowing like a great river through the night, guides calling softly at every turn. The creek crossing passed without incident; the men kept formation; the veterans steadied the newer troops with quiet confidence.\n\n\nAs the first pale light touches the eastern sky, Don Íñigo gives the signal. The column begins to fan out, regiments peeling off to take their positions north of Aversa, across the road to Capua. The men move with purpose, tired but focused. You can see the dark mass of Aversa's walls perhaps half a mile to the south, still and silent.\n\n\nFor a moment, you allow yourself to believe you have achieved complete surprise.\n\n\nThen Don Fadrique gallops up, his horse lathered.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty—movement on the walls. They've seen us.\"\n\n\n\nYou raise your spyglass. In the growing light, you can make out figures on Aversa's towers—men pointing north, toward your deploying army. A bell begins to toll, harsh and urgent. Then another.\n\n\n\"How long until the infantry is in position?\" you ask Don Íñigo.\n\n\nHe glances at the deploying regiments. \"Another hour, perhaps a little less, to be properly formed across the road. The lead regiments are in place, but the center and rear are still coming up.\"\n\n\nAs he speaks, you see something else through the spyglass. Movement at Aversa's northern gate. Not men on walls—men outside the walls. Horsemen, forming up in the fields beyond the town.\n\n\nDon Fadrique has seen it too. \"He's not waiting. He's coming out.\"\n\n\n\nThrough the spyglass, the picture becomes clearer with each passing minute.\n\n\nFrench cavalry—hundreds of them—are forming into squadrons outside the northern gate. The heavy cavalry of France, the finest in Europe: armored knights on barded horses, lances glinting in the early light. Behind them, you can see infantry streaming out of the gate, forming column on the road.\n\n\nRené has made his decision. He is not going to sit in Aversa and wait to be surrounded. He is going to punch through your lines while they are still forming, while your infantry is still deploying, while the northern road is held by only your vanguard regiments.\n\n\nDon Íñigo's jaw tightens. \"He's fast, I'll give him that. Another half hour and we'd have had him boxed.\"\n\n\n\"How many cavalry?\" you ask.\n\n\nDon Fadrique calculates. \"I see perhaps... eight hundred heavy horse forming. Maybe more behind them. His best troops—the French knights who rode south with him. If he throws them at our lead regiments before the rest of the infantry is up...\"\n\n\nHe doesn't finish the sentence. He doesn't need to.\n\n\nYour vanguard—perhaps four thousand infantry—holds the northern road. Good men, veterans, but they are not yet properly entrenched. Behind them, the rest of the army is still deploying, still marching into position. Your own cavalry is spread thin, screening the flanks and rear.\n\n\nEight hundred French heavy cavalry, charging in formation, can break an infantry line that isn't ready for them. Every man present knows this.\n\n\n\nDon Íñigo turns to you, his voice steady but urgent.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, we have minutes, not hours. What are your orders?\"\n\n\nThrough the spyglass, you watch the French cavalry complete their formation. A banner rises above them—the arms of Anjou. René himself is there, somewhere in that mass of steel and horseflesh, preparing to lead the charge that will either save his army or destroy it.\n\n\nThe sun crests the horizon, bathing the field in golden light.\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

He arrives to find his vanguard engaged, the situation unclear in the dust and chaos. He has perhaps 300-400 cavalry with him; more are coming but not yet arrived. The battle is already underway.\n11-20\nCharge Imminent — Juan gathers approximately 500 cavalry and reaches the northern road just as the French begin their advance. He has seconds, not minutes, to assess the situation and issue orders. The vanguard infantry is formed but not braced for the impact. The French are perhaps 400 yards out and accelerating.\n21-35\nNarrow Window — Juan arrives with 600-700 cavalry as the French complete their formation and begin moving forward at a walk. He has perhaps five minutes before they reach charge distance. The vanguard is formed across the road but exposed—no time for entrenchment, limited time for repositioning. Don Íñigo has done what he can.\n36-50\nTime to Prepare — Juan gathers approximately 800 cavalry and reaches the northern road while the French are still forming. He has perhaps ten minutes before they advance—enough time to position his cavalry, assess the ground, and ensure the vanguard infantry is properly braced. The situation is urgent but not yet critical.\n51-65\nGood Position — Juan arrives with 900-1,000 cavalry while the French are still organizing their column behind the cavalry screen. He has fifteen minutes or more—time to position his forces, coordinate with Don Íñigo, and prepare a proper reception. The vanguard is steady; the men see their king arriving with reinforcement.\n66-80\nStrong Reinforcement — Juan gathers nearly 1,200 cavalry—almost his full mounted strength—and reaches the northern road well before the French advance. The vanguard infantry cheers as he arrives. He has time to survey the ground, position his horsemen on the flanks, and ensure the infantry knows what is coming. The French can see his banner now; they know he is there.\n81-90\nCommanding Position — Juan arrives with 1,400 cavalry, having gathered nearly every mounted man not actively screening. He reaches the northern road with ample time to prepare—the French are still sorting out their infantry column behind the cavalry. The vanguard is steady and braced; his cavalry is positioned on both flanks. He can see René's banner clearly across the field.\n91-100\nFull Strength, Full Preparation — The trumpet call brings cavalry streaming from every direction. Juan arrives at the northern road with over 1,500 horsemen—his heavy cavalry as well as the jinetes. The French have not yet begun their advance; they appear to be reconsidering their options as they watch Castilian reinforcements pour into position. Juan has time to prepare the ground exactly as he wishes.\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

I need to stop and wait for Juan's orders - not generate any dialogue or actions for him.\n\nThe situation:\n- Juan has ~1,200 cavalry\n- The vanguard infantry (~4,000 men) is on the road\n- The French heavy cavalry (~800) is forming but hasn't advanced yet\n- French infantry is streaming out behind them forming column\n- Juan has time to survey the ground and position forces\n- The French can see his banner\n\nI should describe:\n1. What Juan sees as he arrives\n2. The disposition of his forces\n3. The French forces and their state\n4. The terrain\n5. Any relevant tactical details\n\nThen STOP and wait for Juan's orders. Do NOT suggest what he should do. Do NOT have anyone ask him questions. Just describe the situation and stop.\n\n\nStrong Reinforcement\n\n\nThe trumpet's call cuts through the dawn air, sharp and urgent. Within moments, cavalry begins streaming toward your position from across the deploying army—jinetes wheeling from their screening positions, men-at-arms abandoning their places in the column, knights spurring their horses toward the sound.\n\n\nYou ride hard for the northern road, and they follow.\n\n\n\nThe Northern Road — Minutes Later\n\n\nYou arrive at the vanguard position with nearly twelve hundred horsemen at your back. Don Fadrique is beside you; other cavalry commanders follow in a thunder of hooves. The men of the vanguard—four thousand infantry holding the road—turn at the sound and see your banner approaching.\n\n\nA ragged cheer rises from the ranks. Their king has come.\n\n\nDon Íñigo meets you as you rein in, his face grim but steady. He gestures toward the field ahead without speaking.\n\n\n\nWhat Juan Sees\n\n\nThe Ground:\n\n\nThe northern road runs straight through open farmland—fields of wheat and barley, a few scattered olive groves, low stone walls marking property boundaries. The road itself is raised slightly, packed earth wide enough for four wagons abreast. To the east, the ground rises gently toward a low ridge. To the west, it slopes down toward marshy ground near a stream.\n\n\nYour vanguard holds a position across the road where two stone walls create a natural chokepoint. Not ideal for defense, but better than open ground. The infantry has formed up in dense blocks, spears bristling, crossbowmen positioned behind the front ranks.\n\n\nYour Forces Present:\n\n\nVanguard infantry: ~4,000 men (spearmen, crossbowmen, swordsmen)\n\nCavalry just arrived with Juan: ~1,200 (mix of heavy cavalry and jinetes)\n\nMore infantry still deploying behind you, perhaps ten minutes away\n\nArtillery and baggage train: still coming up, not yet in position\n\n\nThe French:\n\n\nPerhaps six hundred yards to the south, between your position and Aversa's walls, the French army is forming.\n\n\nThe cavalry is ready—you count approximately eight hundred heavy horse in three squadrons, lances vertical, horses stamping. René's banner flies above the center squadron. They have completed their formation and are watching your arrival.\n\n\nBehind them, French infantry continues to stream through Aversa's northern gate—pikemen, crossbowmen, men-at-arms on foot. They are forming column on the road, but the process is disordered, hurried. You estimate perhaps three thousand infantry already out of the gate, with more still coming.\n\n\nFrench Disposition:\n\n\nThe cavalry is positioned to charge directly up the road at your vanguard. The infantry column is forming behind them, clearly intended to follow through whatever gap the cavalry creates. Baggage wagons and camp followers are visible further back, near the gate—they are trying to bring everything with them.\n\n\nThe Distance:\n\n\nSix hundred yards separates your line from the French cavalry. A charge at full gallop covers that distance in perhaps two minutes. But they have not yet begun to move.\n\n\nThey are watching you. Watching your cavalry take position on the flanks. Watching your infantry brace behind the stone walls. Watching their window of opportunity narrow with each passing moment.\n\n\n\nThe sun is fully up now, bathing the field in clear morning light. Your banner snaps in the breeze beside you. Twelve hundred cavalry await your orders. Four thousand infantry hold the road. The French army stands poised between you and the walls of Aversa, ready to charge or ready to reconsider.\n\n\nRené can see you now. You can see him—a figure beneath the Anjou banner, surrounded by his household knights.\n\n\nThe moment stretches.\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

Risk: charging prepared infantry behind stone walls with cavalry on the flanks is dangerous. French heavy cavalry is formidable, but this is not ideal ground.\n\n2. **Retreat back to Aversa** - Accept that the breakout has failed, return to the walls, prepare for siege. Humiliating but safe. Risk: morale collapse, being trapped with a demoralized army.\n\n3. **Attempt a flanking maneuver** - Try to go around Juan's position. Risk: takes time, exposes his column to attack, may not work.\n\n4. **Negotiate** - Send an envoy to buy time or seek terms. Risk: shows weakness, may not get favorable terms.\n\n5. **Wait and see** - Hold position, assess the situation, see if Juan makes a mistake. Risk: every minute more Castilian reinforcements arrive.\n\n6. **Feint and probe** - Send a smaller force to test Juan's lines while keeping options open.\n\nHistorical considerations:\n- French heavy cavalry was renowned but also sometimes recklessly brave\n- A charge uphill against prepared infantry behind walls is suicidal\n- René is not stupid - he knows the mathematics\n- His army is already demoralized from disease and defeats\n\n\n- If he charges and fails, his entire army is destroyed\n- If he retreats, he may be able to negotiate from behind walls\n- Every minute that passes, his situation gets worse\n- But a failed charge would be catastrophic\n\nI'll craft a d100 table that captures the psychological tension of René's critical decision-making. The rolls will reflect his internal struggle between desperation and military prudence, with outcomes ranging from impulsive action to calculated strategy.\n\nThe table design will emphasize the high stakes: a single roll could determine the fate of his entire army, balancing between rash heroism and strategic survival.\n\n\nRené's Reaction — d100 Table\n\n\nThe Situation René Faces:\n\n\nHis cavalry is formed and ready, but Juan has arrived with ~1,200 horsemen\n\nThe Castilian vanguard (~4,000 infantry) holds a chokepoint behind stone walls\n\nCastilian cavalry now threatens his flanks if he charges\n\nMore Castilian infantry is visibly deploying behind Juan's position—perhaps ten minutes away\n\nHis own infantry (~3,000) is still forming column, disordered\n\nEvery minute that passes, his window narrows further\n\nHis army is already weakened by disease, desertion, low morale\n\nA failed charge means destruction; a retreat means siege\n\n\nRené's Character:\n\n\nExperienced commander, not reckless\n\nProud—he came to claim a kingdom\n\nPolitically astute—understands when a cause is lost\n\nHis army includes proud French nobles who may pressure him to act\n\nHe has been losing for months; desperation may cloud judgment\n\n\nHistorical Considerations:\n\n\nFrench heavy cavalry of this era was renowned but sometimes fatally aggressive\n\nCharging prepared infantry behind fieldworks with cavalry on flanks is extremely dangerous\n\nMedieval commanders often chose negotiation or retreat when odds turned against them\n\nAn army that has watched its situation deteriorate may fracture under pressure\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nReckless Charge — René's pride, or pressure from his knights, overwhelms military judgment. The French cavalry begins advancing immediately, building to a charge. Whether René ordered it or his hotheaded nobles forced his hand is unclear. The charge is coming.\n6-15\nDesperate Gamble — René calculates that this is his last chance. In ten minutes, the odds will be impossible. He orders the charge—not from recklessness, but from cold assessment that a slim chance now is better than no chance later. The cavalry begins to move.\n16-25\nProbing Attack — René sends forward a single squadron (~200-250 heavy horse) to test your lines, while holding his main force back. He wants to see how your infantry reacts, whether your cavalry will countercharge, whether there is any weakness to exploit. A limited engagement, not a full commitment.\n26-35\nInfantry Forward — René recognizes that cavalry alone cannot break your position. He orders his infantry to advance and form up alongside the cavalry, preparing a combined assault. This takes time—ten to fifteen minutes—during which more Castilian reinforcements will arrive. He is gambling that a coordinated attack will succeed where a cavalry charge alone would fail.\n36-45\nHesitation — René holds position, neither advancing nor retreating. He watches your reinforcements arriving, watches his window closing, but cannot bring himself to order either charge or withdrawal. His officers await orders that do not come. The army stands in the field, paralyzed by indecision. Minutes pass.\n46-55\nDemonstration and Assessment — René orders his cavalry to advance at a walk, closing the distance to perhaps 300 yards, but not charging. A show of force, an attempt to intimidate, and a closer look at your dispositions. He is buying time to think, watching for any sign of weakness or disorder in your lines.\n56-65\nCouncil of War — René calls his senior commanders to him for rapid consultation. The French army holds position while its leaders argue. Some urge attack; others counsel retreat. The debate is visible from your lines—gesturing figures beneath the Anjou banner. The decision is delayed, but not yet made.\n66-75\nFighting Withdrawal Preparation — René recognizes the breakout has failed. He begins reorganizing his forces—cavalry screening, infantry preparing to retire through the gates. He intends to retreat to Aversa and defend the walls. His army begins to pull back, but slowly, maintaining formation, ready to fight if you advance.\n76-85\nEnvoy Sent — A rider breaks from the French lines under flag of parley, galloping toward your position. René has chosen negotiation—seeking terms, buying time, or simply trying to understand your intentions before committing to battle or retreat. The French army holds position, awaiting the envoy's return.\n86-95\nOrderly Retreat — René immediately recognizes the trap has closed. He orders an immediate withdrawal to Aversa—cavalry covering, infantry retiring through the gates in good order. No negotiation, no hesitation. He accepts that the breakout has failed and moves to preserve his army behind walls.\n96-100\nArmy Fragments — Before René can give any order, his army begins to come apart. Italian mercenaries refuse to advance; some French knights demand attack while others counsel retreat; the infantry column dissolves into arguing clusters. René has lost control of the moment. Different units begin acting independently—some retreating, some holding, some preparing to surrender.\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

He reaches the cavalry but the delay costs precious seconds. The counter-charge launches late and disordered. Meanwhile, the French charge hits the infantry before the crossbowmen loose a proper volley. The stone walls hold, but barely—the line buckles dangerously. The counter-charge strikes but without full coordination. A chaotic melee develops with no clear advantage.\n6-15\nHeavy Cost — Juan reaches his cavalry safely, but the French charge is devastating. The crossbow volley thins the ranks but does not break them. French knights crash into the infantry line with tremendous force—the center holds, but one flank gives way. The counter-charge strikes the French in the flank and relieves pressure, but the damage is done. Hundreds of Castilian infantry dead or wounded. The French cavalry is badly mauled but not destroyed. A bloody, indecisive clash.\n16-25\nCostly Success — Juan reaches safety and the counter-charge launches on time. The crossbow volley empties dozens of saddles. The French charge strikes the stone walls and stalls—horses cannot leap the barriers, knights bunch up at the chokepoint. The counter-charge hits them from both flanks while they are disordered. The French cavalry breaks, but the fighting is fierce. Significant casualties on both sides. The French retreat in disorder, but many escape.\n26-40\nHard Fight, Clear Advantage — Juan reaches his cavalry and organizes the counter-charge effectively. The crossbowmen deliver a punishing volley. The French charge hits the infantry hard—men die on both sides—but the line holds. The counter-charge strikes the French flanks while they are engaged with the infantry. The French cavalry is broken and scattered, streaming back toward Aversa. Castilian casualties are moderate; French cavalry is shattered as a fighting force.\n41-55\nSolid Victory — Everything works as planned. Juan reaches safety easily. The crossbow volley staggers the charge before impact. The infantry braces behind the stone walls and absorbs the blow. The counter-charge, well-timed, catches the French cavalry at their most vulnerable—committed, disordered, unable to maneuver. The French break. Hundreds of knights cut down or captured in the rout. Castilian casualties are manageable. The French cavalry ceases to exist as an organized force.\n56-70\nDecisive Engagement — The crossbow volley is devastating—scores of French knights and horses fall before they reach the line. The charge, already weakened, crashes into steady infantry who do not break. The counter-charge is textbook: Castilian cavalry sweeping into both flanks, rolling up the disordered French. René's cavalry disintegrates. Knights throw down lances and surrender; others flee toward Aversa; many are cut down. The road is littered with French dead. Castilian losses are light.\n71-80\nCrushing Victory — The French charge breaks before it truly begins. The crossbow volley empties saddles by the dozen. The infantry stands like a wall. When the counter-charge hits, the French cavalry simply collapses—men surrendering, horses fleeing riderless, knights trampled by their own side. The pursuit is brief and bloody. French cavalry losses are catastrophic; Castilian losses are minimal. The survivors stream back toward Aversa in complete disorder.\n81-90\nRout — The combination of crossbow fire, steady infantry, and perfectly-timed counter-charge is more than the French can withstand. The charge stalls before the stone walls; the counter-charge shatters it utterly. French knights flee in all directions—some toward Aversa, some toward the fields, some throwing themselves on Castilian mercy. Hundreds captured, hundreds dead. René's banner wavers and falls back toward the town. The flower of French chivalry lies broken on the field.\n91-95\nAnnihilation — The French cavalry is destroyed as a fighting force in minutes. Crossbow bolts scythe through their ranks; the infantry holds without yielding an inch; the counter-charge is a hammer blow that leaves nothing standing. Those who are not killed are captured. Very few escape to Aversa. René himself is somewhere in the chaos—his fate unclear. The Castilian army has barely broken stride. The French infantry behind watches in horror as their cavalry evaporates.\n96-100\nTotal Destruction and Capture — The charge fails catastrophically. French knights die in heaps before the stone walls. The counter-charge sweeps the field. In the chaos, René of Anjou is unhorsed—captured, killed, or fled, to be determined. The French cavalry is not merely defeated but annihilated: killed, captured, or scattered beyond recovery. The French infantry, witnessing the destruction of their cavalry, begins to waver before a single Castilian sword has reached them.\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

A thousand crossbows loose as one.\n\n\nThe volley strikes the charging mass like the fist of God.\n\n\nHorses scream and tumble. Knights are punched from their saddles, bolts piercing armor at this range. The front rank of the charge simply disappears—men and horses crashing to the earth, those behind stumbling over the fallen. You see perhaps sixty, seventy saddles emptied in that single moment.\n\n\nBut the charge does not stop. It cannot stop. The weight of eight hundred horsemen carries them forward through their own dead, over the fallen, toward the stone walls.\n\n\n\nThe Impact\n\n\nThe French cavalry hits the infantry line like a wave breaking against rock.\n\n\nThe stone walls—waist-high barriers marking old field boundaries—channel the charge into a chokepoint. Horses cannot leap them; knights bunch up, losing momentum. The infantry braces, spears leveled, shields locked.\n\n\nThe crash is tremendous. Men die on both sides in that first instant—French knights spitted on Castilian spears, infantry trampled beneath iron-shod hooves. The noise is deafening: steel on steel, screaming horses, shouting men.\n\n\nBut the line holds.\n\n\nThe veterans of Granada do not break. They have faced Moorish cavalry on a dozen fields. They know that if they stand, they live; if they run, they die. They stand.\n\n\nThe French charge stalls at the walls, knights milling, unable to break through, unable to retreat, trapped by their own numbers pressing from behind.\n\n\n\nThe Counter-Charge\n\n\nYou give the signal.\n\n\nDon Fadrique leads the right wing—six hundred horsemen sweeping around the chokepoint, hitting the French cavalry in their exposed flank. From the left, another five hundred strike the other side.\n\n\nThe counter-charge is textbook.\n\n\nThe French, already disordered by the walls and the crossbow fire, cannot respond. They are caught between the infantry in front and cavalry on both flanks. There is nowhere to go.\n\n\nRené's cavalry disintegrates.\n\n\nKnights throw down their lances and raise empty hands in surrender. Others try to flee toward Aversa and are cut down from behind. Horses bolt riderless across the field. Men are pulled from saddles and beaten to the ground. The proud squadrons that formed up at dawn have become a panicked mob.\n\n\nFrom your position with the reserve—three hundred horsemen held back as you ordered—you watch the destruction unfold. The road is littered with French dead. The wheat fields are trampled red. René's banner, which flew so proudly minutes ago, has vanished in the chaos—fallen, fled, you cannot tell.\n\n\n\nThe Aftermath of the Charge\n\n\nWithin fifteen minutes, it is over.\n\n\nThe French cavalry has ceased to exist as an organized force. You estimate:\n\n\nFrench cavalry losses: 300-400 dead, perhaps 200-250 captured, the rest fled toward Aversa in complete disorder\n\nCastilian infantry losses: Perhaps 150-200 dead and wounded—painful, but manageable\n\nCastilian cavalry losses: Light—perhaps 40-50 men\n\n\nThe field before the stone walls is carpeted with fallen men and horses. Wounded knights cry for aid; riderless horses wander aimlessly; Castilian soldiers move among the fallen, taking surrenders and finishing those who resist.\n\n\nDon Fadrique rides up, his sword bloodied to the hilt. He is grinning fiercely.\n\n\nBeyond the carnage, perhaps four hundred yards south, you can see the French infantry. Three thousand men or more, formed in column on the road, who watched their cavalry charge to destruction.\n\n\nThey have not moved.\n\n\nThey stand in the morning sun, leaderless—for René is nowhere to be seen—watching your army re-form, watching your cavalry wheel back into position, watching the prisoners being led away.\n\n\nBehind you, the rest of the Castilian army continues to arrive. Fresh regiments marching into position. Artillery finally coming up. Nineteen thousand men, assembling on the field of their victory.\n\n\nThe French infantry watches. And waits.\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

The French infantry begins forming into defensive squares, preparing to fight or retreat to Aversa. Crossbowmen move to the front. They will not yield without battle.\n6-10\nRené Wounded, Officers Defiant — Word comes that René was unhorsed and wounded in the cavalry rout—he has been carried back toward Aversa. His senior officers, proud French nobles, refuse to surrender in his absence. They demand time to consult with their lord. The infantry holds position, neither surrendering nor attacking.\n11-20\nRetreat Attempted — No response to your demand. Instead, the French column begins to move—slowly, in formation, backing toward Aversa's gates. They are attempting an orderly withdrawal behind the walls rather than surrendering in the field. They will not attack, but they will not yield either.\n21-30\nConfusion and Delay — Shouting from within the French ranks. Officers arguing visibly. No clear response emerges. Some units begin to waver; others hold firm. The army is paralyzed by indecision. Someone calls for a parley, but no envoy emerges. Minutes pass in tense uncertainty.\n31-40\nParley Requested — A French officer rides forward under improvised white flag. He does not offer surrender but requests terms for negotiation. René is alive but his condition and location are not disclosed. The officer has authority to talk, not to surrender. They are buying time, testing your intentions.\n41-55\nRené Absent, Officers Negotiate — An envoy emerges: a senior French nobleman, disheveled and shaken. He reports that René fled to Aversa during the cavalry rout. He speaks for the infantry and asks what terms you offer. The army will consider surrender, but wants guarantees—lives, ransoms, honorable treatment. Negotiation begins.\n56-70\nRené Present, Seeks Terms — Movement in the French ranks. René himself rides forward, accompanied by a small escort, under flag of parley. He is battered—unhorsed during the charge, his armor dented—but alive and in command. He asks what terms you offer for surrender of the army. He is beaten and knows it.\n71-80\nConditional Surrender Offered — René is present among the infantry. An envoy rides out immediately with an offer: the French will surrender and quit Naples entirely, returning to Provence, in exchange for free passage and retention of personal arms and horses for the nobility. René will renounce his claim. They want to go home.\n81-90\nUnconditional Surrender — René rides forward personally, banner lowered, sword reversed in the gesture of submission. He offers unconditional surrender of himself and his army. He asks only for honorable treatment of his men and that the wounded be cared for. He is broken—months of failure have culminated in this final disaster.\n91-95\nArmy Surrenders Before René Can Respond — The French infantry begins laying down arms before any formal negotiation. Unit commanders order their men to ground weapons. By the time René can be found among the chaos, half his army has already surrendered. He has no choice but to follow. The army gives itself up piecemeal, company by company.\n96-100\nComplete Capitulation — René rides forward alone, dismounts, and kneels in the dirt between the armies. He offers his sword in full surrender—his army, his claim, himself as prisoner. The French infantry follows his lead, grounding arms, many weeping openly. Some fall to their knees in the field. The war ends not with negotiation but with total submission.\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

The answer is no. René is alive, in command, and refuses to yield his claim or acknowledge Alfonso. The French infantry begins withdrawing toward Aversa in good order. They will take their chances behind the walls. The siege begins.\n6-15\nRejection with Counter-Terms — De Coëtivy returns with a counter-offer. The French will withdraw to Aversa and thence to France, but René will not renounce his claim to Naples. He will acknowledge a truce only—the matter to be settled by negotiation or future war. They reject permanent surrender of the claim.\n16-25\nStalling — De Coëtivy returns asking for more time. A full hour, perhaps two, to consult with all commanders and with René himself. They are not refusing, but not accepting either. They want to see if your army truly has cannons coming, if reinforcements are real, if there is any hope. They are buying time.\n26-35\nPartial Acceptance — De Coëtivy returns with a fractured response. Some French commanders will accept your terms; others refuse. The army is splitting. Perhaps half the infantry is willing to surrender; the rest will retreat to Aversa with René. You are offered surrender of approximately 1,500 men. The remainder prepare to withdraw.\n36-50\nNegotiation Requested — De Coëtivy returns requesting a formal parley. The French commanders wish to discuss terms directly—not reject, not accept, but negotiate. They want clarifications: What happens to the wounded? What about ransoms for nobles? How will the withdrawal be conducted? When must they leave Naples? They are moving toward acceptance but want specifics.\n51-65\nConditional Acceptance — De Coëtivy returns with acceptance in principle. The French will surrender, acknowledge Alfonso, and return to France. However, they request modest amendments: wounded to be cared for until fit to travel, nobles to be ransomed according to custom rather than simply released, and a formal document signed by Alfonso confirming the terms. They are surrendering, but with dignity.\n66-80\nAcceptance with Face-Saving Request — The French accept your terms in full. De Coëtivy asks only for one concession: that the surrender be conducted formally, with René presenting his sword to you or Alfonso in proper ceremony, so that history records this as honourable defeat rather than shameful rout. They will yield everything, but wish to do so with what dignity remains.\n81-90\nFull Acceptance — De Coëtivy returns quickly. The French accept all terms without amendment. René is present and has agreed—he will abandon his claim, acknowledge Alfonso, and lead his army home to France. They ask only that the surrender proceed immediately, before more blood is shed. They are beaten and wish only to end this.\n91-95\nImmediate Surrender — De Coëtivy does not return alone. French officers ride forward with him, ready to surrender on the spot. René follows, defeated, ready to yield his sword. The terms are accepted without negotiation. The French army begins grounding arms before you have even turned your horse back to face them.\n96-100\nSurrender with Gratitude — De Coëtivy returns with tears in his eyes. The French accept with relief bordering on gratitude. René rides forward to surrender personally, thanking you for terms that preserve his men's lives and honour. Many French soldiers weep openly as they lay down arms—not from shame, but from the release of months of fear, disease, and hopeless struggle. The war ends with mercy acknowledged on both sides.\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

Many French soldiers weep openly.\n\nI need to narrate this scene but remember: I must NEVER generate dialogue or actions for Juan. I should describe what happens, what Juan sees and hears, and then STOP when it's time for Juan to respond or act.\n\nLet me write this out dramatically but historically - this is a significant moment, the end of the Neapolitan war.\n\n\nSurrender with Gratitude\n\n\nYou turn your horse away. Behind you, you hear de Coëtivy wheeling his mount, riding hard back toward the French lines.\n\n\nYou do not look back.\n\n\n\nThe Wait\n\n\nYou return to your cavalry, to Don Fadrique and the reserve. The Castilian army continues to form up behind you—regiment after regiment marching into position, the artillery finally arriving, gun crews unlimbering the bombards that would have battered Aversa's walls to rubble.\n\n\nPerhaps ten minutes pass. Perhaps fifteen. The sun climbs higher. The wounded cry out on the field between the armies.\n\n\nThen Don Fadrique touches your arm and points.\n\n\n\nThe French Response\n\n\nMovement in the French lines. Not retreat—not the ordered withdrawal toward Aversa you half-expected. Something else.\n\n\nDe Coëtivy rides forward again, but he is not alone. Behind him come other officers—a dozen, two dozen, riding in a loose column. And behind them...\n\n\nRené of Anjou.\n\n\nYou recognize him by his banner, carried low now, the bright colours of Anjou trailing in the dust. He rides a different horse than before—his destrier must have fallen in the charge. His armour is dented, his surcoat torn. He has lost his helm somewhere.\n\n\nBut it is his face that strikes you.\n\n\nHe looks like a man who has set down a burden he has carried for years. Not broken—not weeping, not collapsed—but relieved. The desperate tension that must have driven him through months of siege, through disease and desertion, through the destruction of his cavalry this very morning... it is gone.\n\n\nDe Coëtivy reaches you first. His voice is rough, and you realize with surprise that there are tears on his cheeks.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty. The Duke of Anjou accepts your terms. All of them. Without amendment.\"\n\n\nHe struggles to compose himself.\n\n\n\"His Grace thanks you for your mercy. He asks that history record that the men of France were defeated by a worthy enemy who granted them honour in defeat.\"\n\n\nBehind de Coëtivy, René of Anjou dismounts. He removes his gauntlets, one by one, and hands them to an attendant. Then he draws his sword—slowly, deliberately—and reverses it, holding the blade, offering the hilt.\n\n\nHe walks forward on foot, alone, until he stands before your horse.\n\n\nHis eyes meet yours. He is perhaps forty, his face lined with exhaustion, his beard unkempt after months of campaign. But there is no hatred in his gaze. No bitterness. Only the strange peace of a man who has finally accepted what he cannot change.\n\n\n\nBehind René, the French infantry watches. And then, without orders, without ceremony, they begin to lay down their arms.\n\n\nFirst one company. Then another. Spears thrust into the earth. Crossbows set down. Swords unbuckled and placed on the ground. Three thousand men disarming themselves in the morning sun.\n\n\nSome of them are weeping.\n\n\nNot from shame—or not only from shame. They weep from exhaustion, from relief, from the release of months of fear and sickness and hopeless struggle. They have been dying by inches in a foreign land, far from home, for a cause that was lost before it began. And now it is over.\n\n\nA French sergeant—grey-haired, weathered, the look of a man who has seen too many wars—falls to his knees as he sets down his pike. He makes the sign of the cross and bows his head, his shoulders shaking.\n\n\nRené still stands before you, sword reversed, waiting.\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

Invite Neapolitan nobles to attend at Joanna's castle\n\nI need to remember who Queen Joanna is and what her situation is.

Actually, let me first establish what happens as they move - the logistics of handling 3,000 prisoners, the march, and then arriving at wherever Joanna is.\n\nI think a d100 table is appropriate here for how the political consolidation goes.\n\n\nYou accept René's sword with a nod of respect, then return it to him—a gesture that causes a murmur through the watching French ranks. He is your prisoner, but he will be treated as befits his station.\n\n\n\"You will ride with me,\" you tell him. \"As my guest, not in chains.\"\n\n\nRené inclines his head. Whatever he expected, it was not this.\n\n\n\nThe Aftermath\n\n\nThe surrender proceeds with remarkable order. Don Íñigo organizes the disarmament—French soldiers filing past Castilian clerks who record names, units, places of origin. They keep their personal arms and armour as promised; only the army's artillery, baggage, and war materials are confiscated.\n\n\nThe wounded are gathered—French and Castilian alike—and carried to field hospitals. Surgeons work through the morning, saving those who can be saved.\n\n\nBy midday, the French army has become a column of paroled soldiers, preparing to march north toward Rome and eventually home to France. De Coëtivy will lead them; René remains with you.\n\n\nAlfonso rides up from Naples, having received word of the victory. He stares at the field—the dead horses, the surrendered arms stacked in piles, the French banner lying in the dust—and then at René, mounted beside you under Castilian guard.\n\n\n\"Dios mío,\" he breathes. \"You did it. You actually did it.\"\n\n\n\nQueen Joanna II\n\n\nNow the question of Naples itself must be settled.\n\n\nQueen Joanna II—the aging, childless monarch whose disputed succession caused this entire war—has been silent for months. She resides at Castel Capuano in Naples, having refused to declare for either Alfonso or René since the conflict began. Her health is failing; she is sixty-one years old and has outlived four husbands and countless intrigues.\n\n\nHer acknowledgment of Alfonso as her heir—and her repudiation of René—would settle the matter legally as well as militarily.\n\n\nYou send riders ahead: King Juan of Castile and King Alfonso of Aragon request an audience with Her Majesty. The Duke of Anjou, lately claimant to her throne, accompanies them as prisoner. The noble houses of Naples are invited to attend and witness the resolution of the succession.\n\n\n\nThe Response — d100 Table\n\n\nThis table determines:\n\n\nQueen Joanna's condition and willingness to receive you\n\nThe response of Neapolitan nobles to the invitation\n\nThe general political atmosphere as the succession is resolved\n\n\nFactors:\n\n\nRené's total defeat removes the main obstacle to Alfonso's claim\n\nCalabrian barons have been hedging; now they must choose\n\nJoanna has played both sides for years—her true feelings are unknown\n\nHer health is poor; she may not have long to live\n\nThe Castilian army's presence is both reassuring and intimidating\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nJoanna Dead or Dying — Word returns that Queen Joanna collapsed days ago and lies on her deathbed, unable to receive anyone. The succession will be decided without her blessing—or complicated by rival claims to interpret her final wishes. The nobles gather, but in confusion rather than resolution. A crisis within a victory.\n6-15\nJoanna Hostile — The Queen receives you, but coldly. She has always resented Alfonso and blames both claimants for the destruction of her kingdom. She refuses to formally acknowledge either successor, declaring that Naples will choose its own king after her death. The nobles attend but sense weakness. Legal ambiguity remains.\n16-25\nJoanna Reluctant — The Queen is frail but lucid. She receives you with weary resignation rather than welcome. She will acknowledge Alfonso, but extracts concessions first—guarantees for her household, pardons for those who supported René, promises regarding the governance of Naples. The nobles attend cautiously, watching for advantage.\n26-40\nFormal Acknowledgment — Joanna receives you with the cold dignity of a queen who has survived decades of intrigue. She formally acknowledges Alfonso as her heir and repudiates René's claim, but without warmth or enthusiasm. It is a legal transaction, not a reconciliation. The nobles attend and witness; the succession is settled, if not celebrated.\n41-55\nPragmatic Acceptance — Joanna welcomes you with the practicality of a woman who has outlived her enemies by knowing when to bend. She acknowledges Alfonso publicly and thanks Juan for ending the war that was destroying her kingdom. The Neapolitan nobles attend in significant numbers, ready to make peace with the new order. A workable settlement.\n56-70\nGenuine Welcome — Joanna receives you with something approaching warmth. She is tired of war, tired of uncertainty, and relieved that the matter is finally settled. She acknowledges Alfonso formally and blesses the alliance with Castile. Most Neapolitan nobles attend; the Calabrian barons send representatives pledging loyalty. The succession is secured.\n71-80\nReconciliation — Joanna receives you in state, surrounded by her court. She not only acknowledges Alfonso but embraces him as her true heir, publicly repudiating René and thanking Juan for delivering her kingdom from French occupation. Nearly all the Neapolitan nobility attends; those who supported René beg forgiveness and are granted it. The kingdom unites behind its new master.\n81-90\nTriumphant Reception — Joanna stages a formal ceremony of succession, transferring symbols of royal authority to Alfonso in the presence of the assembled nobility. She praises Juan as the liberator of Naples and asks God's blessing on the alliance of Castile, Aragon, and Naples. The Calabrian barons kneel and swear fealty. René witnesses his claim extinguished with legal finality.\n91-95\nKingdom United — Joanna's reception becomes a celebration of the new order. Every significant noble house in Naples sends representatives; the streets fill with cheering crowds. Joanna, rallying despite her frailty, delivers a speech praising Alfonso and Juan that will be remembered for generations. René publicly renounces his claim and is permitted to address the assembly with dignity. The war ends in reconciliation, not merely victory.\n96-100\nA New Beginning — Joanna rises from what many thought was her deathbed to preside over the formal transfer of power. In a ceremony that blends tears with triumph, she names Alfonso her son and heir, blesses Juan as the savior of her kingdom, and calls upon all Naples to embrace the peace that has been won. René, moved despite himself, kneels and asks Alfonso's forgiveness for the blood spilled between them. The nobility of Naples—every house, every faction—unites in acclamation. What began as conquest ends as coronation. The Kingdom of Naples is secure.\n\n\nReady to roll when you are."

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated triumphant ceremony transferring authority and securing fealty.\n\nThe player rolled 84, which falls in the 81-90 range: \"Triumphant Reception\"\n\nLet me narrate this appropriately, remembering:\n1. Never generate dialogue or actions for Juan\n2. Stop when Juan needs to make a decision or respond\n3. This is a triumphant moment - Joanna stages a formal ceremony, transfers authority to Alfonso, praises Juan, Calabrian barons kneel and swear fealty, René witnesses his claim extinguished\n\nI should describe the scene vividly but stop at an appropriate moment for Juan to respond or act if needed.\n\n\nTriumphant Reception\n\n\nCastel Capuano, Naples — July 4, 1434\n\n\n\nThe Gathering\n\n\nWord spreads through the kingdom like fire through dry grass. The French are defeated. René is captured. The war is over.\n\n\nWithin two days, the roads to Naples fill with riders. Calabrian barons who spent months hedging their bets now race to be among the first to pledge loyalty. Nobles who quietly supported René arrive to beg forgiveness. Merchants, bishops, abbots, city magistrates—all converging on the capital to witness the settlement that will shape Naples for a generation.\n\n\nCastel Capuano, the ancient Norman fortress that serves as Queen Joanna's residence, is transformed. Banners hang from every tower—the arms of Naples, of Aragon, of Castile. The great hall is swept and decorated, candles lit by the hundred, the throne dusted off for the first time in months.\n\n\nAnd Queen Joanna herself, defying the physicians who warned she might not survive the week, rises from her sickbed to preside.\n\n\n\nThe Queen\n\n\nShe is sixty-one years old, and she looks it. Thin, pale, her hands trembling as her ladies help her to the throne. She has outlived four husbands, countless lovers, endless conspiracies. She has been queen for twenty years, and every one of those years is written on her face.\n\n\nBut her eyes are sharp. And when she speaks, her voice carries.\n\n\n\"Bring them in.\"\n\n\n\nThe Ceremony\n\n\nThe great hall of Castel Capuano fills to overflowing. Every significant noble house of Naples is represented—some by their lords in person, others by sons or brothers sent to test the waters. The Calabrian barons cluster near the back, watching, calculating. Neapolitan merchants and guildmasters line the galleries above.\n\n\nYou enter first, with Alfonso at your side. René walks behind you, unbound but under guard—a prisoner, but a prince still, permitted his dignity.\n\n\nThe crowd parts before you. Whispers ripple through the hall. Many of these men have never seen you before; they know you only by reputation. The king who conquered Granada. The Defensor Romaniae. The man who destroyed the French cavalry in a single morning.\n\n\nQueen Joanna watches from her throne as you approach. Her eyes move from you to Alfonso to René, reading the story written in your faces.\n\n\nWhen you reach the foot of the throne, she raises one trembling hand.\n\n\n\"Kneel.\"\n\n\nAlfonso kneels. You remain standing—you are not her subject, and she does not expect it. René, after a moment's hesitation, kneels as well.\n\n\n\nThe Declaration\n\n\nQueen Joanna speaks, and the hall falls silent.\n\n\n\"For twenty years I have held this throne. I have seen wars and plagues, treachery and triumph. I have buried husbands and lovers, friends and enemies. And I have watched my kingdom bleed while men fought over who would rule it when I am gone.\"\n\n\nHer voice strengthens as she continues.\n\n\n\"That ends today.\"\n\n\nShe gestures, and a servant brings forward a velvet cushion bearing the symbols of Neapolitan sovereignty—a crown, a scepter, a sword of state.\n\n\n\"I, Joanna, by the grace of God Queen of Naples, Jerusalem, and Sicily, do hereby name Alfonso of Aragon my true and lawful heir. Upon my death, he shall succeed to all my titles, lands, and dignities. This I swear before God, before these witnesses, and before the man who made this peace possible.\"\n\n\nShe turns her gaze to you.\n\n\n\"King Juan of Castile. You came to this kingdom not as a conqueror, but as an ally. You shed blood not for your own glory, but for the cause of your kinsman and the peace of Christendom. You offered mercy to your enemies when you might have offered slaughter.\"\n\n\nShe raises her hand toward you.\n\n\n\"Naples will not forget. I will not forget. Let it be recorded that this kingdom owes its peace to the King of Castile, and let my successors honor that debt for generations to come.\"\n\n\n\nThe Barons Kneel\n\n\nWhat follows is a cascade of submission.\n\n\nThe Calabrian barons come forward first—proud men, hard men, who held back for months waiting to see who would win. One by one, they kneel before Alfonso, swearing fealty, pledging their swords and their lands to their new lord.\n\n\nThen the Neapolitan nobility. Then the representatives of the cities. Then the clergy—bishops and abbots blessing the new order, calling down God's favor on the house of Aragon.\n\n\nThose who supported René are brought forward last. They kneel not just to Alfonso but to Joanna herself, begging forgiveness for their disloyalty. The Queen grants it with a wave of her hand—she is too tired for vengeance, and too wise. A kingdom cannot be built on grudges.\n\n\nThrough it all, René watches.\n\n\nHis face is unreadable. He has lost everything—his claim, his army, his dream of a Mediterranean kingdom. He will return to France with nothing but his title and his honor, both preserved by your mercy.\n\n\nWhen the last baron has knelt, Queen Joanna turns to him.\n\n\n\"René of Anjou. You came to take my throne. You failed. But you fought with courage, and you have accepted defeat with grace.\"\n\n\nShe pauses, and something almost like sympathy crosses her ancient face.\n\n\n\"Go home to France. Tell them that Naples belongs to Aragon now. And tell them that the King of Castile is not a man to be trifled with.\"\n\n\n\nThe Aftermath\n\n\nThe ceremony continues for hours—oaths sworn, documents signed, seals affixed. By the time it ends, the sun is setting over the bay, painting the sky in shades of gold and crimson.\n\n\nAlfonso stands on the balcony of Castel Capuano, looking out over the city that will soon be his. His eyes are bright with emotion he does not try to hide.\n\n\n\"Ten years,\" he murmurs. \"Ten years I have fought for this. And in the end, it was you who won it for me, cousin.\"\n\n\nBelow, in the streets, the people of Naples are celebrating. Word has spread: the war is over, the succession is settled, peace has come at last. Church bells ring across the city. Bonfires blaze in the piazzas. Wine flows freely.\n\n\nRené has been escorted to comfortable quarters in Castel Nuovo—a prisoner still, but a well-treated one. In a few weeks, he will be permitted to sail for France with his surviving officers and household.\n\n\nThe Castilian army makes camp outside the city walls, disciplined and orderly. They have won a kingdom for their king's cousin. Soon they will go home.\n\n\nAnd in the Palazzo Caracciolo, Lucia waits—six months pregnant now, the child quickening within her, the future taking shape.\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

Juan executed a masterful nighttime military maneuver, moving 19,000 troops 15 miles under cover of darkness. At dawn, the army arrived in perfect formation near Aversa. René, facing imminent defeat, launched a desperate cavalry charge with 800 heavy horsemen. Juan swiftly organized a counter-charge, resulting in a decisive engagement that decimated the French cavalry, destroying 300 riders in a brutal confrontation.\n\nThe French suffered significant casualties: 400 killed and 200-250 captured, with Castilian losses remaining remarkably light. René, recognizing the futility of further resistance, accepted Juan's surrender terms with remarkable grace. In a formal capitulation, 3,000 French infantry laid down their arms.\n\nThe aftermath unfolded with a triumphant ceremony on July 4th, where all Neapolitan and Calabrian barons swore allegiance to Alfonso. René was granted an honorable passage back to France, concluding a decisive military campaign with diplomatic finesse.\n\n\nView: Reading the docx skill for creating the chapter summary\n\n\nThought process\n\nI need to read the docx-js.md file for creating a new document.\n\n\nView: Reading docx-js.md for document creation syntax\n\n\nThought process: Synthesized historical events into comprehensive chapter documentation.\n\nNow I have the documentation for creating a Word document.

The army arrives with favorable probing cavalry movements (Roll: 64), successfully conducting two skirmishes that map French dispositions and weaken René's forces. Preparations for a critical night march begin, with Don Fadrique scouting the route meticulously. The execution of the military maneuver looks promising, supported by a solid roll of 62.\n\nThe massive troop movement unfolds dramatically - 19,000 men silently traversing 15 miles under darkness. At Aversa, the French launch a desperate breakout attempt (Roll: 15), but Juan strategically reinforces the northern road with 1,200 cavalry (Roll: 70). The decisive engagement results in total French cavalry destruction: 300-400 killed, 200-250 captured, with minimal Castilian losses.\n\nJuan demands surrender, which the French accept with remarkable gratitude (Roll: 97). René accepts all terms, with 3,000 infantry surrendering. The campaign culminates in a triumphant reception for Queen Joanna, featuring a formal succession ceremony transferring power to Alfonso. All Neapolitan and Calabrian barons swear fealty, and René is permitted an honorable return to France.\n\n\nNow I'll create the chapter summary document:\n\n\nCreate File: Creating Chapter 2.27 summary document\n\n\nThought process\n\nNow I need to run the script to create the document.\n\n\nBash Tool: Creating the Chapter 2.27 summary document\n\n\nThought process\n\nThe document was created successfully.
