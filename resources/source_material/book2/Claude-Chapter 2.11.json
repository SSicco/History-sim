The Tagus ran low in its gorge beneath the city, the water sluggish between rust-colored rocks. In the streets, even the vendors moved slowly, their cries halfhearted beneath the relentless afternoon sun.\n\n\nWithin the Alcázar, servants had hung dampened linens across the windows of the royal apartments, creating a dim, breathing coolness that turned the chambers into a world apart from the blazing city below. Isabel lay upon cushions in the great bed, propped against bolsters, wearing only a light linen shift. Her belly had grown enormous in these final weeks—larger than with Catalina, the physicians said, though they offered this observation with genuine smiles rather than the grim masks they had worn eighteen months ago.\n\n\nQueen Leonor of Portugal sat in a high-backed chair near the window, embroidering with the patient persistence of a woman who had attended too many births to be rattled by the waiting. Doña Beatriz and two other Portuguese ladies occupied themselves with quiet tasks, their voices low murmurs that rose and fell like distant water.\n\n\nJuan had just returned from the training yards, where he had spent the morning with Sir Thomas Beaumont reviewing the latest class of officer candidates. His doublet was unlaced at the throat, his dark hair damp with sweat. He paused in the doorway, letting his eyes adjust to the dimness.\n\n\nIsabel looked up from the book that lay open across her belly—a devotional, its pages illuminated with tiny flowers in blue and gold. Her face was fuller than it had been, softened by pregnancy, but her eyes still held that particular light that had grown stronger since his return from Basel. The light of a woman who had stopped being afraid.\n\n\n\"The baby is restless today,\" she said. \"I think he knows his father is near.\""

For a moment there was stillness—then a sudden pressure rolled beneath your hand, firm and insistent, like a wave moving through deep water.\n\n\n\"There,\" Isabel breathed. \"Do you feel it?\"\n\n\nAnother movement, sharper this time. A limb—an elbow, perhaps, or a knee—pressed outward against your palm with surprising force. The shape of it was unmistakable through the taut skin of her belly.\n\n\nQueen Leonor looked up from her embroidery with a knowing smile. \"Active. That is good. The quiet ones worry me more.\"\n\n\nIsabel placed her hand over yours, pressing it more firmly against the place where the baby moved. \"Dr. Gonçalo says perhaps another week. Perhaps two.\" She paused, her fingers tightening slightly on yours. \"He says... he says everything is as it should be. The position. The heartbeat. Everything.\"\n\n\nThere was wonder in her voice. After Catalina's birth—the hours of screaming, the blood, the physicians' grave faces, the weeks of fever that followed—neither of you had dared to hope for easy. Yet here she was, in her final weeks, color high in her cheeks, complaining of nothing worse than the heat and the tedium of waiting.\n\n\n\"He kicked me awake three times last night,\" Isabel added, and there was something almost like complaint in her tone—the complaint of a woman who had expected suffering and found instead only ordinary discomfort. \"I think he will be impatient, this one. Like his father.\"\n\n\nDoña Beatriz looked up from her needlework. \"Or stubborn, like his mother. Her Majesty refused to be born for three days past her time. Her grandmother was beside herself.\"\n\n\nQueen Leonor laughed softly. \"She has always done things in her own way, my Isabel. Even before she drew breath.\"\n\n\nThe baby kicked again beneath your palm—strong, insistent, alive."

Maternal mortality rates ranged from 1-3% per delivery among nobility with good care, significantly higher among common women. However, certain factors dramatically affected outcomes.\n\n\nEvaluating This Specific Case\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (things that make this delivery more likely to succeed):\n\n\nExceptional pregnancy progression (Roll 100 in Chapter 2.10)\n\n\nBaby turned head-down, properly positioned\n\nIsabel's swelling subsided, color improved\n\nPortuguese physicians \"cautiously optimistic rather than grimly prepared\"\n\nDr. Gonçalo: \"I came expecting to fight for two lives. Now I am cautiously optimistic I will not need to fight at all.\"\n\nExcellent medical care available\n\n\nPortuguese royal physicians traveled from Lisbon specifically\n\nQueen Leonor of Portugal present (experienced in managing royal births)\n\nToledo has best facilities in Castile\n\nIsabel's first birth gave physicians experience with her specific anatomy\n\nIsabel's improved physical and mental health\n\n\nWalking again, normal energy levels\n\nGenuine laughter, fear replaced by hope\n\nNot exhausted or depleted going into delivery\n\nStronger than she was for Catalina's birth\n\nSecond pregnancy after surviving difficult first\n\n\nBody has delivered before (generally easier)\n\nPhysicians know what complications to watch for\n\nIsabel knows what to expect psychologically\n\nJuan present and supportive\n\n\nReduced stress for Isabel\n\nShe's not carrying emotional burden of his absence\n\nHousehold calm rather than anxious\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (genuine obstacles that don't disappear):\n\n\nPrevious traumatic delivery\n\n\nCatalina's birth: breech presentation, hours of labor, massive blood loss\n\nIsabel nearly died, weeks of fever\n\nPhysicians warned future pregnancies \"very risky\"\n\nHer body carries damage from that birth\n\n\"Extensive internal damage\" was diagnosed\n\n15th-century medicine\n\n\nNo antibiotics if infection develops\n\nNo blood transfusions if hemorrhaging occurs\n\nNo cesarean section (= certain death in this era)\n\nIf something goes wrong, options are extremely limited\n\nHistorical reality of childbirth mortality\n\n\nEven \"easy\" deliveries can turn fatal unexpectedly\n\nPostpartum infection kills many who survive delivery itself\n\nHemorrhage remains unpredictable risk\n\nCord complications, placental problems, etc.\n\nIsabel's age and constitution\n\n\nNow 17 years old (young, but not unusually so for the era)\n\n\"Plain appearance\" suggests not robust constitution\n\nPrevious near-death weakened her overall\n\nThis baby is larger\n\n\n\"Larger than with Catalina\" was mentioned\n\nLarger baby = more difficult delivery\n\nMore strain on Isabel's damaged tissues\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: Queen Isabel's Delivery\n\n\nNote on Range Setting: The exceptional pregnancy roll (100) and excellent conditions shift ranges significantly favorable. However, the historical reality of childbirth danger and Isabel's previous trauma mean catastrophic outcomes remain possible. This is NOT a persuasion roll—it's a CHAOS roll where genuine unpredictability exists.\n\n\n\n1-5: CATASTROPHIC - Both Lost\n\n\nThe delivery begins normally but Isabel hemorrhages catastrophically during labor. The physicians cannot stop the bleeding. Despite Queen Leonor's desperate prayers and the physicians' best efforts, Isabel dies before the baby can be delivered. The child—a boy—is lost with her.\n\n\nJuan loses his wife and heir in a single terrible hour. The kingdom's succession crisis becomes immediate and devastating. Everything Juan has built—his family, his hope, his future—shatters.\n\n\nConsequences: Isabel dead. Baby dead. Juan faces devastating grief and immediate succession crisis. Political implications enormous.\n\n\n\n6-10: DISASTER - Isabel Lost, Baby Survives\n\n\nThe delivery is difficult—the baby's size strains Isabel's damaged tissues. The physicians manage to deliver a healthy son, but Isabel begins bleeding heavily afterward. For hours they fight to save her, but the hemorrhaging cannot be stopped. Isabel dies in Juan's arms, having seen her son but once.\n\n\nJuan has his heir but loses his love. The physicians did everything possible—the baby lived because Isabel's body gave everything to bring him into the world.\n\n\nConsequences: Isabel dead. Healthy son survives. Juan faces grief while caring for infant heir. Princess Catalina now has baby brother but no mother.\n\n\n\n11-15: SEVERE CRISIS - Isabel Survives Barely, Long Recovery\n\n\nSomething goes wrong during delivery—perhaps the placenta doesn't detach properly, perhaps Isabel tears badly, perhaps infection sets in within hours. The baby is delivered safely—a healthy boy—but Isabel collapses into fever and bleeding.\n\n\nFor weeks she hovers between life and death, as she did after Catalina. Queen Leonor never leaves her side. The Portuguese physicians fight for her life. Eventually, Isabel stabilizes, but she is broken. Months of recovery await. Physicians grimly advise: no more pregnancies. Ever. Another would certainly kill her.\n\n\nConsequences: Healthy son. Isabel survives but severely damaged. Months bedridden. Career as mother ended—Catalina and new baby are her only children. Physicians absolutely forbid future pregnancies.\n\n\n\n16-25: DIFFICULT - Complications but Both Survive\n\n\nLabor is longer and harder than the optimistic pregnancy suggested. The baby's size causes tearing. Isabel bleeds more than the physicians like. For several tense hours after delivery, they work to control bleeding and watch for infection.\n\n\nBut Isabel is stronger than she was. Her body, while tested, holds. The baby—a healthy boy—nurses within hours. Isabel will need weeks of careful recovery, and the physicians caution against attempting another pregnancy for several years, but both mother and child survive intact.\n\n\nConsequences: Healthy son. Isabel recovers over 4-6 weeks. Physicians advise waiting 2-3 years before another pregnancy. Not as good as hoped, but everyone survives.\n\n\n\n26-45: MODERATE - Normal Difficult Delivery\n\n\nA medieval delivery is never easy, but this one proceeds as well as can be expected. Labor takes most of a day—painful, exhausting, frightening at times. Isabel screams, prays, grips Doña Beatriz's hands until her knuckles go white.\n\n\nBut the baby comes. A boy, healthy and crying lustily. Isabel bleeds, but within normal limits. The physicians are pleased. Queen Leonor weeps with relief. Recovery will take the standard 2-3 weeks of lying-in, but no serious complications develop.\n\n\nConsequences: Healthy son. Isabel recovers normally over 2-3 weeks. Physicians cautiously optimistic about future pregnancies with proper spacing (2+ years). Standard good outcome for the era.\n\n\n\n46-70: GOOD - Smooth Delivery\n\n\nThe exceptional pregnancy proves prophetic. Labor begins in the morning and the baby arrives by evening—swift by medieval standards. Isabel's body, perhaps because it has delivered before, perhaps by God's grace, performs as it should.\n\n\nThe boy is perfect—strong, loud, with excellent color. Isabel bleeds minimally. The midwife and physicians exchange surprised, pleased looks. Queen Leonor prays fervent thanks. Within days Isabel is sitting up, nursing her son, laughing with relief.\n\n\nConsequences: Healthy son. Isabel recovers quickly over 1-2 weeks. Physicians genuinely optimistic. A blessing after the terror of Catalina's birth.\n\n\n\n71-85: EXCELLENT - Remarkably Easy\n\n\nAgainst all expectation, the delivery is almost easy. Labor is short—mere hours. The baby practically presents himself, positioned perfectly, emerging with minimal assistance. The physicians barely need to intervene.\n\n\nIsabel, though exhausted, is euphoric. The boy is large but healthy, and his size caused none of the feared problems. The midwife remarks that she rarely sees deliveries this smooth, especially in women who had difficult first births. \"God has blessed this house,\" Queen Leonor declares.\n\n\nConsequences: Healthy son. Isabel recovers within a week. Physicians believe her previous damage has healed remarkably. Future pregnancies genuinely possible with normal caution.\n\n\n\n86-95: EXCEPTIONAL - Perfect Delivery, Perfect Child\n\n\nEverything goes right. The delivery is swift, almost gentle by childbirth standards. Isabel breathes through contractions using techniques the Portuguese midwife taught her. The baby emerges in a single sustained push, crying immediately, vigorous and strong.\n\n\nIsabel's body shows none of the damage feared. The bleeding is minimal. By the next morning she is sitting up demanding to see Catalina, to introduce the princess to her new brother. The Portuguese physicians are genuinely amazed—they had prepared for crisis and found none.\n\n\nConsequences: Healthy son, exceptionally vigorous. Isabel recovers in days. Physicians declare her previous injuries somehow fully healed—perhaps the second pregnancy helped rather than hurt. Future children genuinely possible.\n\n\n\n96-100: MIRACULOUS - Twins\n\n\nThe delivery is swift—too swift. When the baby emerges, healthy and crying, the physicians prepare for afterbirth. Instead, Dr. Gonçalo's face changes. \"There is another.\"\n\n\nA second child. A twin, hidden throughout the pregnancy. Within minutes, a second boy joins his brother—smaller but healthy, breathing strong, crying in harmony with his sibling.\n\n\nIsabel, stunned, weeps with joy. Twin boys. An heir and a spare, born in a single miraculous delivery. The physicians cross themselves. Queen Leonor falls to her knees in prayer. Castile has two princes.\n\n\nConsequences: Twin healthy sons. Isabel recovers well. The dynasty is secured twice over. A miracle that will be remembered for generations.\n\n\n\nRoll When Ready\n\n\nThe table is set. Isabel's fate—and the fate of the Castilian succession—awaits the dice."

The Portuguese midwife murmured encouragement. Dr. Gonçalo checked Isabel's progress at intervals, his weathered face betraying cautious optimism. Queen Leonor held her daughter's hand through the contractions, wiping sweat from her brow, whispering prayers in Portuguese.\n\n\nJuan waited in the antechamber, as custom demanded. Álvaro de Luna sat with him, saying nothing, his presence enough. Fray Hernando prayed quietly in the corner. Through the heavy doors came Isabel's cries—sharp at first, then deeper, more guttural, the sounds of a body doing the hardest work it would ever do.\n\n\nBy midday, the baby came.\n\n\nA boy. Large and healthy, with strong lungs that announced his arrival to the entire wing of the Alcázar. The midwife cut the cord. Dr. Gonçalo wrapped the child in prepared linens. For one perfect moment, Isabel held her son—their son—and smiled through her exhaustion.\n\n\n\"He has your eyes,\" she whispered to Juan, who had been summoned the instant the child emerged. \"Look at him. He's perfect.\"\n\n\nJuan knelt beside the bed, one hand on the swaddled infant, one hand clasping Isabel's. Her grip was weak but her smile was real. Seventeen years old, mother of two, wife of a king who loved her. In that moment, everything they had built together seemed secure.\n\n\nThen Dr. Gonçalo's face changed.\n\n\n\nThe Bleeding\n\n\nIt began slowly—a trickle that should have stopped but didn't. The physician's hands moved with sudden urgency beneath the sheets. Queen Leonor's prayers grew faster, more desperate. The midwife called for more linens, then more, then more.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Dr. Gonçalo said to Juan, his voice carefully controlled, \"you should take the child to the nursery. We must work now.\"\n\n\nJuan didn't move. He watched Isabel's face—watched the color drain from her cheeks, watched her eyes lose focus, watched her grip on his hand weaken.\n\n\n\"Juan.\" Her voice was barely a whisper. \"Take care of them. Catalina. And...\" She looked toward the bundle in the nurse's arms. \"Does he have a name?\"\n\n\n\"Not yet.\" Juan's voice broke. \"We were going to choose together.\"\n\n\n\"Choose something strong.\" A ghost of her old smile. \"Something that sounds like... like a king.\"\n\n\nThe physicians were shouting now. Linens soaked red were being carried away. Queen Leonor was on her knees, sobbing prayers. Doña Beatriz stood frozen in the corner, her face white as ash.\n\n\n\"Isabel.\" Juan gripped her hand tighter, as if he could hold her to this world through force of will. \"Mi amor. Mi reina. Stay with me.\"\n\n\nHer eyes found his one last time.\n\n\n\"I'm not afraid anymore,\" she said. \"You taught me that. To trust... even when...\"\n\n\nShe didn't finish.\n\n\n\nThe Silence\n\n\nThe physicians worked for another hour, though they knew. They had known from the moment the bleeding began in earnest—the kind of hemorrhage that couldn't be stopped, not with the linens and herbs and prayers that were all 15th-century medicine could offer.\n\n\nQueen Leonor had to be carried from the room, her screams echoing through the corridor. Doña Beatriz remained, weeping silently, clutching the rosary Isabel had given her years ago.\n\n\nJuan didn't leave.\n\n\nHe held Isabel's hand as it grew cold. He watched her face settle into stillness—that plain face he had learned to love, those eyes that had looked at him with such trust, such hope, such faith. He remembered the night in Jaén when she had first said she loved him. The letter from her mother about arranged marriages. The terror in her voice when she told him she was pregnant again.\n\n\nNo one has ever asked me to come, she had said when he invited her to Constantinople.\n\n\nShe would never come now.\n\n\n\nThe Living\n\n\nThe baby was healthy.\n\n\nThat was what Dr. Gonçalo finally said, hours later, when Juan still hadn't moved from Isabel's bedside. \"Your Majesty. The Prince is healthy. Strong. He nurses well—the wet nurse reports no difficulties.\"\n\n\nJuan looked up. His face was empty—not grief-stricken, not yet. That would come later. For now there was only hollowness where his heart had been.\n\n\n\"And Catalina?\"\n\n\n\"The Princess has been kept in the nursery. She doesn't know yet.\"\n\n\nSeventeen months old. Too young to understand that her mother was gone. Too young to remember her, in time.\n\n\nJuan stood. His legs were stiff from kneeling. The room smelled of blood and sweat and the herbs the physicians had burned trying to stop what couldn't be stopped.\n\n\n\"I need to see my daughter,\" he said. \"And my son.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando was waiting in the antechamber. The Franciscan's face was grey with grief, but his voice was steady. \"Your Majesty. I am here.\"\n\n\nJuan walked past him without a word.\n\n\nThere would be time for confession later. Time for prayers, for masses, for the elaborate mourning rituals of a medieval court. Time for the political calculations—the succession secured by a son, the Portuguese alliance now complicated, the question of remarriage that would inevitably arise.\n\n\nBut first he had to hold his children.\n\n\nBoth of them.\n\n\nThe living ones.\n\n\n\nThe nursery was quiet when Juan entered. Catalina slept in her small bed, thumb in her mouth, oblivious to the catastrophe that had reshaped her world. In a cradle beside her, the newborn Prince slept as well—that deep, profound sleep of infants, his tiny chest rising and falling with each breath.\n\n\nJuan stood between them for a long time.\n\n\nHis daughter, who would never remember her mother's face.\n\n\nHis son, who had cost his mother everything.\n\n\nOutside the window, the bells of Toledo began to toll. Someone had given the order—Álvaro, probably. The city was learning that their Queen was dead.\n\n\nJuan sank into the chair between the two cradles. He reached out, one hand touching Catalina's hair, one hand resting on the edge of his son's cradle.\n\n\nAnd finally, alone with his children, Juan II of Castile began to weep.\n\n\n\nThe Queen is dead.\n\n\nLong live the Prince.\n\n\n\n[The scene is yours. What does Juan do?]"

      "say": "The hallways of the Alcázar felt endless in the dim light of evening. Servants pressed themselves against walls as Juan passed, their faces stricken, some weeping openly. Word had spread through the palace with the terrible swiftness that bad news always travels.\n\n\nCatalina was awake when Juan entered the nursery—standing in her crib, gripping the wooden rails, her face scrunched in that particular expression of toddler frustration that meant she had been crying and no one had come quickly enough.\n\n\n\"Pa!\" Her face transformed the moment she saw him. Arms up, demanding. \"Pa!\"\n\n\nJuan lifted her. She was heavier than he remembered—eighteen months of growth, of life continuing while he had been in Rome, in Basel, in Como. She smelled of the lavender water the nurses used, and of something else, something purely Catalina—warm and alive and utterly ignorant of what had just happened three rooms away.\n\n\nShe grabbed his beard immediately, tugging with the casual violence of infancy. \"Pa,\" she said again, satisfied now that the world had righted itself.\n\n\n\"Yes, mi pequeña.\" His voice cracked. \"Papa is here.\"\n\n\n\nQueen Leonor was in the small chapel adjacent to the royal apartments. Juan found her on her knees before the altar, her shoulders shaking, her prayers a continuous stream of Portuguese that broke and reformed like waves against rock.\n\n\nShe looked up when the door opened. Her face was ravaged—eyes swollen, cheeks wet, the composed dignity of a queen entirely abandoned. For a moment she simply stared at Juan, at the child in his arms.\n\n\nThen something harder surfaced beneath the grief. The practical knowledge of a woman who had borne children, buried children, survived.\n\n\n\"The baby?\" she asked. Her voice was hoarse.\n\n\n\"A boy. Healthy. The wet nurse says he feeds well.\"\n\n\nLeonor closed her eyes. Her lips moved—prayer or curse, Juan couldn't tell.\n\n\n\"Give me Catalina.\" She rose stiffly, her joints protesting the hours on stone. She held out her arms. \"She should not... she cannot see...\"\n\n\nJuan transferred his daughter to her grandmother. Catalina, sensing the strangeness in the air, grew quiet. She looked between the two adults with wide, uncertain eyes.\n\n\n\"Avó?\" she said—the Portuguese word for grandmother that Leonor had been teaching her. \"Avó sad?\"\n\n\nLeonor pulled the child close, burying her face in Catalina's dark hair. \"Yes, querida. Avó is very sad.\"\n\n\nShe looked at Juan over Catalina's head. The grief was still there, vast and drowning, but beneath it was something else now—the same steel he had seen in Isabel when she faced her fears.\n\n\n\"You have a son,\" Leonor said. \"Castile has an heir. My daughter gave everything for that.\"\n\n\nHer voice broke on the last word.\n\n\n\"Go,\" she managed. \"Go to your son. Name him. Let Isabel's sacrifice mean something.\" She clutched Catalina tighter. \"I will keep this one safe. I will... I will tell her, when she is older. I will make sure she knows what her mother was.\"\n\n\nCatalina had begun to whimper, infected by the grief she couldn't understand. Leonor rocked her gently, automatically, the motions of a woman who had soothed countless children through countless sorrows.\n\n\n\"What will you name him?\" Leonor asked.\n\n\nThe question hung in the chapel's dim air, heavy with incense and grief and the weight of a kingdom's future.\n\n\n\n[What does Juan say?

Or simply recognition that Juan was already thinking beyond grief, toward legacy.\n\n\n\"As you wish, Your Majesty.\" She adjusted Catalina on her hip, the child now quiet, thumb in mouth, watching everything with those wide dark eyes that missed nothing.\n\n\n\nThe Main Hall\n\n\nThe shout echoed through the Alcázar's corridors. Servants scattered to obey—some to the kitchens, some to the guardrooms, some to the chambers where nobles and officials had been waiting in anxious clusters since the bells began to toll.\n\n\nJuan collected his son from the wet nurse's arms. The infant was swaddled tightly in white linen, only his face visible—red and wrinkled, eyes squeezed shut, utterly unaware that he had entered the world at such terrible cost. He was warm against Juan's chest, impossibly small, impossibly fragile.\n\n\nIsabel held you once, Juan thought. For a few minutes, she held you and smiled.\n\n\nThe walk to the main hall felt like a march to battle.\n\n\n\nThe Assembly\n\n\nThey came quickly—those who were in the Alcázar, those who could be summoned in minutes rather than hours.

Leonor followed three paces behind, Catalina in her arms. The child had gone very still, sensing the gravity she couldn't comprehend.\n\n\nJuan turned to face the assembly. In his arms, the infant stirred—a small sound, not quite a cry.\n\n\nThe faces before him were a tapestry of grief, fear, and desperate hope. They had heard the bells. They knew the Queen was dead. Now they needed to know what came next.\n\n\nJuan looked down at his son. Then up at his people.\n\n\nThe hall waited.\n\n\n\n[What does Juan say to announce his son and address Isabel's death?]"

She has moved on to God's kingdom and I am sure she has already found her place in heaven. There was not a shred of greed, pride or other sin on her soul.

      "say": "I have already read the NPC guide earlier in this session. Let me now construct a realistic d100 table for the assembly's reaction to Juan's raw, grief-stricken speech.\n\n\n\nREACTION ROLL ANALYSIS: The Assembly's Response to Juan's Announcement\n\n\nContext\n\n\nJuan has just delivered an emotionally devastating speech—raw, unscripted, moving from theological reflection to personal anguish to the presentation of his heir, ending with a primal scream of grief. This is not a calculated political address; it is a man breaking before his court while still performing his duty as king.\n\n\nEvaluating This Specific Case\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (things that make a positive reaction more likely):\n\n\nGenuine emotion, not performance\n\n\nThe court has seen Juan's theatrical moments before\n\nThis is clearly different—real grief, real anger, real pain\n\nAuthenticity resonates; people can tell the difference\n\nDuty fulfilled despite devastation\n\n\nJuan presented his heir even in the depths of grief\n\nHe addressed the kingdom's need for certainty about succession\n\nThis demonstrates kingship—personal suffering doesn't stop royal obligations\n\nTheological framing that honors Isabel\n\n\nPortrayed Isabel as already in heaven, free of sin\n\nConnected her purity to his own crusading mission\n\nGave her death meaning within Christian framework\n\nShared grief, not isolated mourning\n\n\nAsked entire kingdom to pray and mourn together\n\nMade Isabel's death a communal loss, not just royal tragedy\n\nUnited court in shared sorrow rather than leaving them as spectators\n\nThe heir exists and is healthy\n\n\nWhatever else has happened, succession is secured\n\nA son, not a daughter—removes succession uncertainty\n\nNamed him Fernando—strong, traditional, crusader-king associations\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (concerns that don't disappear):\n\n\nPublic loss of composure\n\n\nMedieval kings are expected to maintain dignity\n\nThe final scream (\"WHY?!!!\") could be seen as weakness\n\nSome may worry about a king who breaks so publicly\n\nImplicit self-criticism\n\n\n\"Imperfections that taint all of us, that taint me\"\n\nSome may wonder what sins Juan carries\n\nOpens door for critics to question his judgment\n\nTheological claims about Isabel's sinlessness\n\n\nOnly the Church can declare someone a saint\n\nClaiming she had \"not a shred\" of sin is technically presumptuous\n\nClergy may note this oversteps, even if they understand grief\n\nPolitical vacuum created\n\n\nQueen's death leaves court without female leadership\n\nPortuguese alliance now complicated\n\nQuestions about remarriage will arise (too soon to voice, but people think them)\n\nGrief may impair judgment\n\n\nSome will worry Juan's emotional state affects his rule\n\nMajor decisions pending (Constantinople, Morocco, reforms)\n\nCan a grief-stricken king lead effectively?\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: Assembly's Reaction\n\n\nNote on Range Setting: This is a CHAOS roll for collective emotional response. Juan's speech was raw and genuine—not politically calculated—so the roll determines how his vulnerability lands with a medieval court that values both strength and piety. The authenticity shifts ranges favorable, but the public breakdown creates real risk.\n\n\n\n1-5: DEEPLY TROUBLED\n\n\nThe assembly is shaken—not by grief alone, but by what they witnessed. Juan's raw scream echoes in their minds as they file out in silence. In whispered conversations that night, concerns surface: Is the King well? Can he rule in this state? He spoke of visions, of glimpses of God's kingdom—is this piety or something else?\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna spends the night managing worried nobles who remember Juan's father—a king whose grip on reality loosened over time. The comparison is unfair but inevitable. Fray Hernando is approached by multiple clergy asking whether they should be concerned about the King's spiritual state.\n\n\nThe heir is welcomed, but the relief is tempered by fear. A healthy son means nothing if the father cannot rule.\n\n\nConsequence: Significant concern about Juan's mental state. Álvaro must work to reassure nervous nobles. Some begin quietly discussing contingencies.\n\n\n\n6-15: UNCOMFORTABLE RESPECT\n\n\nThe assembly respects Juan's grief—a man who loved his wife so deeply is not to be mocked. But the public breakdown lingers uncomfortably. Kings should mourn, yes, but with dignity. The scream was... too much.\n\n\nNobles bow and murmur condolences as they depart, but their eyes carry questions they dare not voice. The Portuguese delegation clusters around Queen Leonor, their grief genuine but also tinged with concern about what Isabel's death means for the alliance.\n\n\nFray Hernando notes that Juan's theological claims about Isabel were beautiful but imprecise. He will need to discuss this privately—not to criticize, but to ensure Juan doesn't make such claims publicly again.\n\n\nThe heir is welcomed with appropriate ceremony in the following days, but the celebration is muted. The court watches Juan carefully, waiting to see if he recovers his composure.\n\n\nConsequence: Polite but cautious response. Court reserves judgment, watching Juan's behavior in coming weeks.\n\n\n\n16-30: MOVED BUT CONCERNED\n\n\nMany in the hall weep openly—Juan's grief has unlocked their own. Doña Beatriz collapses into the arms of a Portuguese lady. Even hardened soldiers bow their heads. The King's pain is real, and realness commands respect.\n\n\nBut afterward, in private conversations, concerns emerge alongside sympathy. \"He spoke beautifully of the Queen,\" one noble says, \"but that cry at the end... I fear for him.\" Others note that Juan has always been intense, passionate, driven—qualities that won Granada but might consume him in grief.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna receives quiet inquiries about the state of governance. He reassures everyone that the kingdom's affairs are in order, that Juan will recover, that the heir secures everything. Most accept this, but a few remain watchful.\n\n\nConsequence: Genuine sympathy mixed with some worry. Most give Juan benefit of doubt but remain attentive to signs of instability.\n\n\n\n31-50: RESPECTFUL GRIEF\n\n\nThe assembly responds as a medieval court should to a king's mourning—with solemn respect, shared tears, and quiet solidarity. Juan's speech is understood as a grieving husband's tribute to his wife, not analyzed for theological precision or political implications.\n\n\nWhen Juan screams his anguish, several nobles cross themselves. It is raw, yes—but who among them has not felt such pain? Who has not wanted to cry out against God's inexplicable cruelty? The King is human, and his humanity does not diminish him.\n\n\nThe presentation of Fernando is received with genuine relief and quiet joy. An heir. A son. The succession secured. Isabel's death, though tragic, has meaning—she gave Castile its future.\n\n\nIn the days that follow, the court observes proper mourning. Masses are said, candles lit, prayers offered. Juan's grief is respected, his privacy honored.\n\n\nConsequence: Standard positive response. Court mourns appropriately, accepts Juan's grief as natural, looks forward to recovery.\n\n\n\n51-70: DEEPLY MOVED\n\n\nSomething profound happens in the hall when Juan speaks. His words about Isabel—her purity, her place in heaven, his glimpses of God's kingdom when doing just deeds—resonate with a court that has watched this young king accomplish the impossible.\n\n\nWhen he holds up Fernando and declares him heir, the response is not merely relief but genuine celebration tempered by sorrow. A son! Named for the saint-king who conquered Seville! Isabel's final gift to Castile!\n\n\nAnd when Juan screams his grief—that raw, terrible \"WHY?\"—it breaks something open in the assembly. Hardened veterans weep. Nobles who have buried wives and children feel their own losses resurface. Even Álvaro de Luna's composure cracks for a moment.\n\n\nThe court doesn't see weakness. They see a man who loved his wife completely and is not ashamed to show it. In an age of political marriages and cold alliances, this is something rare and beautiful.\n\n\nConsequence: Strongly positive response. Court deeply moved, rallies around Juan in grief, increased personal loyalty.\n\n\n\n71-85: PROFOUND UNITY\n\n\nJuan's speech achieves something unexpected—it unites the court in shared grief and shared purpose. His words about Isabel become, in that moment, a kind of sermon. His cry of anguish becomes every person's cry against mortality and loss.\n\n\nWhen he asks the kingdom to pray with him, the response is immediate and genuine. Nobles kneel. Servants weep. The Portuguese delegation, despite their own grief and political concerns, feel bound to Castile more tightly than any treaty could achieve—for Isabel was one of theirs, and Juan loved her truly.\n\n\nIn the weeks that follow, the mourning becomes a kind of national moment. Churches throughout Castile hold masses for the Queen's soul. Common people who never saw Isabel's face speak of her virtue. The story spreads: the King who screamed his grief to heaven, the Queen who gave her life for an heir.\n\n\nConsequence: Powerful unifying moment. Court and kingdom bound together in mourning. Juan's reputation enhanced by his visible humanity.\n\n\n\n86-95: TRANSFORMATIVE\n\n\nWhat happens in the hall transcends ordinary mourning. Juan's speech—raw, theological, deeply personal—touches something sacred. Those present will speak of it for years: I was there when the King presented Prince Fernando. I saw him weep for Queen Isabel. I heard him cry out to God.\n\n\nThe combination of duty (presenting the heir despite everything) and vulnerability (the scream of grief) creates a portrait of kingship that resonates deeply with medieval values. A king should love his wife. A king should mourn his dead. A king should still do his duty. Juan has done all three, publicly, without shame.\n\n\nQueen Leonor, despite her devastation, feels a strange pride. Her daughter married well—not just to a throne, but to a man who truly loved her. That love is now visible to everyone. Isabel's memory will be honored, her sacrifice remembered.\n\n\nEven Fray Hernando, who has spent months worried about Juan's messianic tendencies, sees something different here. This is not pride dressed in humility. This is genuine grief, genuine love, genuine faith struggling with genuine loss.\n\n\nConsequence: Major positive impact. Juan's speech becomes legendary. Deep emotional bond forged between king and court. Isabel's memory becomes precious to entire kingdom.\n\n\n\n96-100: HISTORIC MOMENT\n\n\nGenerations later, chroniclers will record what happened in the great hall of the Alcázar on August 3, 1433. They will describe the young king, twenty-one years old, holding his newborn son while his wife's body lay still warm in the chamber above. They will quote his words about glimpsing heaven in just deeds, about seeing Isabel there always.\n\n\nAnd they will describe the cry—that terrible, beautiful, human cry of \"WHY?\"—and how the entire court wept with him.\n\n\nIn that moment, Juan II becomes something more than the king who conquered Granada. He becomes the king who loved his wife so completely that he was not ashamed to break before his people. The king who showed that strength and vulnerability are not opposites.\n\n\nThe presentation of Fernando becomes not just a succession announcement but a sacred moment—a father's grief transformed into a kingdom's hope. The boy will grow up knowing that his mother died to give him life, and that his father honored her memory before all Castile.\n\n\nThe Portuguese alliance, rather than weakening, strengthens. Queen Leonor becomes Juan's fiercest advocate, telling everyone who will listen: \"He loved my daughter. Truly loved her. I could not have asked for more.\"\n\n\nConsequence: Defining moment of Juan's reign. Story spreads throughout Christendom. Isabel becomes a symbol of noble sacrifice, Juan a symbol of devoted kingship. Prince Fernando's birth forever linked to his mother's sacrifice.\n\n\n\nRoll when ready."

Then Juan turns, Fernando clutched to his chest, and walks toward the private chambers with Leonor and Catalina following. The assembly watches him go.\n\n\nNo one moves until the door closes behind him.\n\n\n\nThe Aftermath\n\n\nThat Evening\n\n\nThe court disperses in near-silence, but the silence does not last. In antechambers and corridors, in the quarters of nobles and the rooms of clergy, conversations begin—hushed at first, then growing more urgent.\n\n\n\"Did you see his face?\" a minor noble whispers to his wife. \"At the end, when he screamed—I thought for a moment he might...\"\n\n\n\"He spoke of visions,\" a bishop murmurs to a fellow clergyman. \"Glimpses of God's kingdom. Is this grief, or is this something we should... attend to?\"\n\n\n\"His father,\" someone says—and the words hang in the air like poison. Everyone knows the history. Juan's father, Enrique III, was called \"the Infirm.\" But it was Juan's grandfather, Juan I, whose mental state had been whispered about. And before him...\n\n\nThe Trastámara line has produced great kings. It has also produced kings whose grip on reality was... uncertain.\n\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna's Long Night\n\n\nLocation: Álvaro's chambers, then throughout the Alcázar\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna does not sleep.\n\n\nWithin an hour of the assembly's dispersal, the first visitor arrives—Don Íñigo López de Mendoza, head of House Mendoza, his face carefully neutral.\n\n\n\"The King's grief is understandable,\" Don Íñigo says, settling into a chair without waiting to be invited. \"But that display... Álvaro, I must ask plainly. Is His Majesty well?\"\n\n\n\"He has just lost his wife,\" Álvaro replies. \"He is grieving.\"\n\n\n\"He spoke of seeing God's kingdom. Of glimpses of how things should be.\" Don Íñigo's eyes are sharp. \"He screamed like a madman before the entire court.\"\n\n\n\"He screamed like a man whose heart is broken.\"\n\n\n\"Perhaps.\" Don Íñigo is quiet for a moment. \"I was at Valladolid when his grandfather... when things became difficult. I remember how it started. Small things, at first. Intensity that seemed like passion. Certainty that seemed like faith. And then...\"\n\n\n\"Juan is not his grandfather.\"\n\n\n\"No. He is a young king who has accomplished extraordinary things through extraordinary conviction.\" Don Íñigo leans forward. \"But extraordinary conviction, unchecked, becomes something else. You know this, Álvaro. You have managed him for years. Is he well?\"\n\n\nÁlvaro meets the older man's gaze. \"He is grieving. Give him time.\"\n\n\nDon Íñigo rises. \"I will give him time. But others may not be so patient. You should know—there is talk already. Questions about whether the King's... intensity... is entirely healthy.\"\n\n\nHe pauses at the door.\n\n\n\"The heir is a blessing. But an infant heir with a father who cannot rule is not a blessing. It is a regency. And we all remember how regencies go.\"\n\n\n\nThe Portuguese Delegation\n\n\nQueen Leonor remains with Juan and the children, but the Portuguese nobles and physicians cluster in their assigned quarters, speaking in rapid Portuguese.\n\n\nDr. Gonçalo, still wearing his blood-stained apron, answers their questions grimly. \"The Queen died of hemorrhage. There was nothing more we could have done. These things happen—even to queens, even with the best care.\"\n\n\n\"And the King?\" someone asks.\n\n\nA long pause.\n\n\n\"The King is... grieving.\"\n\n\n\"He spoke strangely,\" one of the nobles says. \"Of visions. Of seeing the Queen in moments of justice. Is this... normal? For Castilians?\"\n\n\n\"It is poetry,\" another suggests. \"Grief makes poets of us all.\"\n\n\n\"It did not sound like poetry. It sounded like a man who believes he sees things others cannot see.\"\n\n\nThe Portuguese exchange glances. They have come to Toledo for a birth and found a death. Their princess is gone. The alliance that her marriage secured now rests on an infant and a king who screamed his grief to heaven.\n\n\n\"We should write to King João,\" someone finally says. \"He will want to know... everything.\"\n\n\n\nFray Hernando's Vigil\n\n\nLocation: The Chapel\n\n\nFray Hernando kneels before the altar, but his prayers are distracted. He has spent months—months—trying to guide Juan away from messianic thinking. Away from the dangerous certainty that his visions are God's visions, that his will is divine will.\n\n\nAnd tonight, before the entire court, Juan spoke of glimpses of God's kingdom. Of seeing Isabel there. Of knowing what they should do if they were not burdened and worldly.\n\n\nThis is my failure, Hernando thinks. I have not taught him properly. I have not helped him distinguish between faith and presumption.\n\n\nBut beneath the self-recrimination, another thought stirs—darker, more troubling.\n\n\nWhat if it is not presumption? What if Juan truly is... unwell?\n\n\nHe has seen the pattern before, in other men. The intensity that burns too bright. The certainty that cannot bend. The visions that seem holy until they begin to consume the man who has them.\n\n\nHe had thought Juan's struggles were spiritual—pride masquerading as humility, ambition dressed in piety. Normal struggles for a young king with extraordinary success.\n\n\nBut tonight...\n\n\nTonight he saw something in Juan's eyes, at the moment of that scream, that he has never seen before. Something that looked less like grief and more like a man coming apart at the seams.\n\n\nLord, Hernando prays, show me what to do. Show me how to help him. And if he is truly ill... show me that too, before it is too late.\n\n\n\nThe Night Passes\n\n\nJuan remains in the private chambers with his children and Queen Leonor. No one disturbs him.\n\n\nBut throughout the Alcázar, candles burn late. Conversations continue in whispers. And a question spreads from room to room, noble to noble, servant to servant:\n\n\nIs the King well?\n\n\nBy morning, it will reach every corner of Toledo.\n\n\nBy week's end, it will reach the borders of Castile.\n\n\nAnd the nobles who swore oaths, who followed Juan to Granada, who stood with him at the Deus Vult covenant... they will begin to watch. And wait. And wonder.\n\n\n\nAugust 4, 1433 - Dawn\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stands outside the door to Juan's private chambers. He has not slept. His face is grey with exhaustion and worry.\n\n\nHe must speak with the King. There are decisions to be made—funeral arrangements, announcements to other kingdoms, the question of how to present Juan publicly in the coming days.\n\n\nBut more than that, he needs to see Juan. To look into his eyes and determine for himself whether the man he has served for years is still... himself.\n\n\nHe raises his hand to knock.\n\n\n\n[What is Juan doing when Álvaro enters? What state is he in?]"

The air is close, thick with the mingled scents of beeswax and grief.\n\n\nDoña Beatriz takes Fernando with the practiced ease of a woman who has held many infants, though her hands tremble slightly. Her eyes are swollen, her face blotched with weeping. She cradles the Prince against her shoulder and retreats to a corner near the other Portuguese ladies—three of them, all red-eyed, all silent, all watching.\n\n\nCatalina clings to her grandmother's neck, her small face pressed into Leonor's shoulder. She has gone very quiet—that particular stillness of a child who senses wrongness everywhere but cannot name it. Her thumb is in her mouth, her dark eyes tracking between the adults.\n\n\nQueen Leonor looks at Juan.\n\n\nShe is sixty years old. She has buried two children of her own—a son who died in infancy, a daughter who died of fever at twelve. She has survived wars, plagues, the endless grinding politics of the Portuguese court. She has held her husband's hand through thirty years of marriage, watched him grow old, watched him fight and win and lose.\n\n\nBut nothing has prepared her for this.\n\n\nHer face is ravaged. The composed dignity she wore in the great hall has crumbled entirely. She looks ancient, hollowed out, a woman whose last reserves have been spent.\n\n\n\"How am I?\" she repeats. Her voice is hoarse, barely above a whisper.\n\n\nFor a long moment she simply stares at Juan. Then something breaks in her expression—not anger, not accusation, but something rawer. The grief of a mother who has outlived her child.\n\n\n\"Minha filha está morta.\" The Portuguese comes unbidden. My daughter is dead. \"My Isabel. My little girl who was afraid of thunderstorms. Who used to climb into my bed when she had nightmares. Who cried for a week when we told her she would marry a foreign king she had never met.\"\n\n\nHer arms tighten around Catalina.\n\n\n\"She was so frightened, Juan. When she left Portugal, she was so frightened. She thought you would not love her. She thought she was too plain, too quiet, too... too ordinary for a king.\" Leonor's voice cracks. \"And then she wrote to me. Letter after letter, telling me how wrong she had been. How you saw her. How you loved her. How she had found something she never expected to find.\"\n\n\nTears stream down her face. She makes no move to wipe them away.\n\n\n\"She died happy. That is what I must believe. She died knowing she was loved, holding her son, with you beside her.\" A shuddering breath. \"But she is still dead. And I am still her mother. And I do not know how to answer your question, Juan. I do not know how I am.\"\n\n\nCatalina stirs against her grandmother's shoulder. \"Avó,\" she murmurs. \"Avó crying.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, querida.\" Leonor strokes the child's hair with a trembling hand. \"Avó is crying.\"\n\n\nShe looks at Juan again—really looks at him, seeing past her own grief for the first time since they entered this room.\n\n\n\"How are you?\" she asks quietly. \"And tell me truly. Not what you told the court. What is actually in your heart right now?\""

You stayed in Toledo instead of riding to Cartagena to see your knights depart for Constantinople. You sat with her every day. You made her laugh again, Juan.

Sometimes the answer to 'why' is simply that we live in a fallen world where mothers die in childbirth and fathers bury sons and all our prayers cannot stop it.\"\n\n\nHer voice drops, fierce and quiet.\n\n\n\"You did not kill Isabel. Your sins—whatever they are—did not kill Isabel. Childbirth killed Isabel. The same thing that kills thousands of women every year, queen and peasant alike. You could have been the holiest man in Christendom and she might still have bled to death in that bed.\"\n\n\nShe steps closer to him, close enough that he can see the broken blood vessels in her eyes, the deep lines that grief has carved around her mouth.\n\n\n\"So no, Juan. I do not think the Lord would have spared her if you had done more. I think the Lord, in His infinite wisdom that we cannot comprehend, decided it was her time. And I hate Him for it right now. I hate Him and I love Him and I do not understand Him at all.\"\n\n\nHer free hand reaches out, grips his arm with surprising strength.\n\n\n\"Do not do what I did. Do not spend years searching for a sin that explains this. You will find sins—we all have them—but none of them killed your wife. None of them.\"\n\n\nCatalina stirs, murmuring something unintelligible. In the corner, Fernando makes a small sound against Doña Beatriz's shoulder—not a cry, just the noise of an infant settling.\n\n\n\"She loved you,\" Leonor says softly. \"She died loving you. That is not nothing. That is not punishment. That is grace, even in the midst of tragedy.\""

Eighteen months old, and the word \"died\" means nothing to her. Heaven is a sound without meaning. \"Gone\" is something that happens when Papa leaves for war and then comes back.\n\n\n\"Mama?\" she says, the word rising at the end like a question. She looks toward the door, as if expecting Isabel to walk through it. \"Mama?\"\n\n\n\"No, mi pequeña.\" Your voice breaks. \"Mama is not coming.\"\n\n\nCatalina's face scrunches—not grief, not yet, but confusion. The wrongness she has sensed all day crystallizing into something she cannot name. Her lower lip trembles.\n\n\n\"Mama,\" she says again, more insistent now. She twists in your lap, looking around the room, searching for the face that has been there every morning of her short life. The face that will never be there again.\n\n\n\nYou carry her to Fernando.\n\n\nThe infant is awake now, his eyes open but unfocused, that milky newborn gaze that sees everything and nothing. He is so small—smaller than Catalina was, you think, though memory is unreliable in such things. His face is red and wrinkled, his hands curled into tiny fists.\n\n\nCatalina peers at him with suspicion. She has seen babies before—the children of servants, of nobles—but this one is here, in her world, demanding attention.\n\n\n\"Nando,\" she tries, mangling the name. She reaches out a finger and pokes his cheek, not gently. Fernando's face scrunches, a thin wail building.\n\n\n\"Careful,\" Doña Beatriz murmurs, shifting the infant away from Catalina's curious fingers.\n\n\n\"I love you very much,\" you tell Catalina.\n\n\nShe looks back at you, distracted from the baby. For a moment something passes across her face—recognition, perhaps, or simply the comfort of familiar words. She leans into your chest, thumb finding her mouth again.\n\n\n\"Pa,\" she says around it. \"Pa sad.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, Catalina. Papa is very sad.\"\n\n\n\nYou pour the wine.\n\n\nYour hand is steady—steadier than it should be, perhaps. The wine is Castilian red, from the Alcázar's cellars, and it splashes into the cup like blood. You drink deeply, not tasting it.\n\n\nOne of the Portuguese ladies brings watered wine for Catalina in a small cup—barely more than flavored water, the way children are given it. Catalina takes it in both hands, drinking messily, some of it dribbling down her chin.\n\n\nQueen Leonor watches you drink. She says nothing, but her eyes carry a question—or perhaps a warning.\n\n\nDoña Beatriz rocks Fernando gently, humming a Portuguese lullaby under her breath. The same lullaby, you realize, that Isabel used to hum to Catalina. The recognition hits you like a blow.\n\n\nThe room is quiet except for Beatriz's humming, Catalina's small slurping sounds, and the distant toll of bells. Toledo is still ringing for its dead queen.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Doña Beatriz says softly, not looking up from Fernando. \"The wet nurse should feed him again soon. And he will need... he will need a nursery arranged. Properly. With staff.\"\n\n\nPractical matters. The world continuing its grinding turn even as your heart lies shattered.\n\n\n\"The Prince should be presented to the court formally,\" Leonor adds, her voice carefully neutral. \"Tomorrow, perhaps. Or the day after. When you are... when arrangements have been made.\"\n\n\nShe means: When you have composed yourself. When you can appear before your nobles without screaming at heaven.\n\n\nCatalina finishes her wine and sets the cup down with a clatter. She looks up at you, face sticky, eyes heavy with exhaustion.\n\n\n\"Mama?\" she asks again, softer now. Still searching. Still waiting.\n\n\n\n[What do you do?]"

The stone walls are cold despite the August heat.

His face is grey, his eyes shadowed, his customary composure frayed at the edges.\n\n\nHe sees you and stops.\n\n\nFor a long moment, neither of you speaks.

Assessing.\n\n\n\"But first,\" he says, more quietly, \"I would ask how you are. Truly.\"\n\n\nThe question Leonor asked. The question everyone will ask, over and over, in the days and weeks to come.

Questions linger in their eyes. But the immediate crisis of confidence ebbs. The king is grieving, they tell themselves. Grieving, but functional. Grieving, but still Juan.\n\n\n\nThe Letters\n\n\nÁlvaro's scribes work through the night. Letters go out to every corner of Christendom:\n\n\nTo His Most Faithful Majesty João I of Portugal:\nThe formal announcement of Isabel's death, written with care and genuine sorrow. Queen Leonor adds a personal letter in her own hand, assuring her husband that their daughter died peacefully, that she was loved, that the grandson who bears the name Fernando is healthy and strong.\n\n\nTo His Majesty Alfonso V of Aragón:\nNews of the Queen's death and the birth of the heir. A reminder that the alliance between Castile and Aragón remains strong. No mention of the succession arrangements discussed at Granada—that conversation will wait.\n\n\nTo His Holiness Pope Eugenius IV:\nA formal announcement requesting prayers for the Queen's soul and blessings upon the newborn Prince. Juan adds a personal note expressing his continued commitment to the Church's reform and the defense of Constantinople.\n\n\nTo Emperor Sigismund:\nBrief, soldier to soldier. The Queen is dead. The heir lives. The work continues.\n\n\nTo the Council of Basel (via Fray Hernando's delegation):\nFormal notification. Castile mourns but remains committed to reform and reconciliation.\n\n\n\nThe Funeral of Queen Isabel\n\n\nAugust 10, 1433\n\n\nLocation: Toledo Cathedral\n\n\nThe Cathedral of Toledo has seen royal funerals before, but few have drawn such crowds. Common people line the streets, weeping for a queen most never saw. Nobles fill the nave in black mourning garb. The Archbishop presides, his voice echoing through incense-thick air.\n\n\nIsabel lies in state in a coffin of carved oak, dressed in white silk, her hands folded over a rosary. She looks peaceful—the physicians and ladies have done their work well. The violence of her death is hidden beneath careful preparation.\n\n\nJuan walks behind the coffin with Catalina in his arms. The child is silent, overwhelmed by the strangeness—the chanting, the incense, the sea of black-clad strangers. She clings to her father's neck and does not cry.\n\n\nQueen Leonor walks beside Juan, her face a mask of dignified grief. Doña Beatriz follows with Fernando, the infant Prince sleeping through his mother's funeral, oblivious to the weight of the moment.\n\n\nThe Mass\n\n\nThe Archbishop speaks of Isabel's piety, her devotion, her gentle spirit. He speaks of her sacrifice—giving her life to bring forth an heir for Castile. He speaks of heaven, of reunion, of the promise that those who die in Christ shall live again.\n\n\nJuan listens. He does not weep. He has wept enough in private; now he is a king, and kings mourn with dignity.\n\n\nWhen the time comes, he steps forward to speak.\n\n\n\nJuan's Eulogy\n\n\nThe cathedral falls silent. Every eye turns to the young king in black, his daughter in his arms, standing before his wife's coffin.\n\n\n[What does Juan say at Isabel's funeral? Or do you wish me to narrate a brief, dignified eulogy?]"

She looks at the coffin, then at you, then at the sea of solemn faces. She does not understand, but she is quiet—perhaps sensing that this moment demands silence even from her.\n\n\nThe Archbishop bows his head. The congregation follows.\n\n\nAnd then it is done.\n\n\n\nThe Interment\n\n\nIsabel is laid to rest in the royal crypt beneath the cathedral, beside the tombs of Castilian kings and queens who came before. The stone closes over her with a sound of grinding finality.\n\n\nQueen Leonor weeps openly as the tomb is sealed. Doña Beatriz clutches Fernando and stares at nothing, her face hollow. The Portuguese ladies huddle together like birds in a storm.\n\n\nJuan watches in silence, Catalina still in his arms. The child has fallen asleep against his shoulder, exhausted by the long ceremony, by the incense and chanting and the strange heaviness in the air.\n\n\nWhen it is finished, the mourners file out into the August sunlight. The bells of Toledo toll one final time, then fall silent.\n\n\n\nThe Aftermath\n\n\nAugust 10-17, 1433\n\n\nThe court observes the traditional period of mourning. Black hangings cover the windows of the Alcázar. Music and entertainment are forbidden. Masses are said daily for the Queen's soul.\n\n\nJuan moves through these days like a man walking through water—present, functional, but distant. He meets with Álvaro each morning to review the kingdom's business. He holds Catalina in the evenings, telling her stories she cannot understand, teaching her words she cannot yet say. He visits Fernando in the nursery, watching his son sleep, searching the infant's face for traces of Isabel.\n\n\nQueen Leonor's Departure\n\n\nOn August 15th, Queen Leonor announces she must return to Portugal. King João is old, and she has been away too long. But she makes Juan a promise before she goes.\n\n\n\"I will return for Fernando's baptism,\" she says, holding his hands in hers. \"And I will write. Often. Catalina must know her Portuguese family. She must know who her mother was.\"\n\n\nShe embraces him—a mother's embrace, fierce and protective—and then she is gone, her retinue riding south toward the border.\n\n\nDoña Beatriz remains. \"The Queen asked me to stay,\" she explains, her eyes red-rimmed. \"To care for the children. To... to remember her, for them.\"\n\n\n\nThe Kingdom Waits\n\n\nLate August 1433\n\n\nThe mourning period ends, but its shadow lingers. The court watches Juan carefully, searching for signs of instability, finding instead a king who works, who plans, who governs. The whispered concerns about his sanity fade—not entirely, but enough. Grief is understood. Grief passes.\n\n\nThe business of the kingdom resumes:\n\n\nConstantinople: Don Juan de Sotomayor departed Cartagena in early August with 300 knights. No word yet from the expedition.\n\nMorocco: Commander Martín's intelligence mission continues. Report expected October or November.\n\nGranada: The scholarly expedition from Salamanca and Valladolid is assessing surviving Islamic knowledge. Findings expected by November.\n\nThe Universities: Planning continues for the proposed Granada institution focused on natural philosophy.\n\nThe Church: Letters from Basel indicate the Council continues its slow deliberations. The Declaration of Como has been received but not yet formally addressed.\n\n\nAnd in Toledo, two children grow:\n\n\nCatalina, now nineteen months old, has stopped asking for Mama. She clings to her father when he is present, cries when he leaves, and has begun calling Doña Beatriz \"Bia\"—the closest she can manage to the name.\n\n\nFernando, one month old, thrives under the wet nurse's care. He is a hungry baby, growing quickly, with strong lungs that announce his displeasure to the entire wing of the Alcázar.\n\n\n\nLate August 1433\n\n\nÁlvaro enters your study one morning with a bundle of correspondence and a expression that suggests the world is ready to demand your attention again.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty. The mourning period has ended. There are matters requiring decision.\"\n\n\nHe sets the papers on your desk.\n\n\n\"Word from Sotomayor—his fleet made landing at Constantinople on August 22nd. The initial report is... complex. The situation there is worse than the Byzantines admitted.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"There is also a letter from King João of Portugal. Personal, not diplomatic. And one from your sister María in Aragón.\"\n\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\n\"And Don Íñigo López de Mendoza has requested an audience. He says the Council of Great Houses has a proposal regarding... the question of Your Majesty's eventual remarriage.\"\n\n\nThe word lands like a stone in still water.\n\n\n\"I told him it was too soon to discuss such matters,\" Álvaro adds quietly. \"He insisted the conversation was necessary. I can send him away if you wish.\"\n\n\n\n[What do you wish to address first?]"

Instead, he finds a king already thinking strategically.\n\n\n\"Of course, Your Majesty.\" He settles into the chair across from your desk, his mind already cataloging possibilities. \"I have given this some thought—as have others, clearly, given Don Íñigo's request.\"\n\n\nHe steeples his fingers.\n\n\n\"Before I present candidates, I should note the considerations that will shape any match:\n\n\nPolitical factors:\n\n\nPortugal is now... complicated. King João will not take offense at remarriage—it is expected—but marrying another Portuguese princess might seem to diminish Isabel's memory. Or it might strengthen the alliance further. It cuts both ways.\n\nAragón remains your closest ally. King Alfonso has no daughters, but there are Aragonese noble houses with eligible women.\n\nFrance and England are entangled in their endless war. A French match would anger England; an English match would anger France. Neither is advisable unless you wish to enter that conflict.\n\nThe Italian states offer possibilities—Naples, Milan, the Papacy's orbit of noble families.\n\nThe Empire—Sigismund has no legitimate children, but there are Habsburg and Wittelsbach connections.\n\n\nPractical factors:\n\n\nYou need more children. Fernando is healthy, but one son is not security. You need a wife who can bear children—young, healthy, from fertile stock.\n\nYou need a wife who can manage the court. Isabel grew into this role beautifully, but she started uncertain. A woman with natural authority would ease the transition.\n\nYou need a wife who will not destabilize existing alliances or create new enemies.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, organizing his thoughts.\n\n\n\nRoyal Candidates\n\n\n\"Beginning with royalty, Your Majesty:\n\n\nPortugal:\n\n\nInfanta Catarina of Portugal — Age 11 (born 1422)\nKing João's youngest daughter, Isabel's sister. The match would reinforce the Portuguese alliance powerfully—marrying sisters is not unknown among royalty. However, she is very young; you would need to wait 2-3 years before marriage and longer before children. There is also the question of whether marrying your dead wife's sister sits well with the Church—dispensation would be required, and some might find it... unseemly.\n\n\nAragón:\n\n\nNo direct royal daughters available. Alfonso V has no children. His heir is his brother Juan (King of Navarre in our timeline, though the Infantes are dead in this one—I should verify current Aragonese succession).\n\n\n[Note: Given the timeline corrections where the Infantes died, Aragonese succession has shifted. Alfonso V remains childless; his heir would likely be a more distant relative or potentially negotiated. This may require clarification.]\n\n\nNavarre:\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Navarre's succession is uncertain following the deaths of the Infantes and young Carlos. There may be eligible noblewomen from the Navarrese court, but no clear royal candidates.\n\n\nFrance:\n\n\nMarie of Anjou is already married to the Dauphin Charles (future Charles VII).\n\n\nYolande of Anjou — Age ~15-16 (if available)\nDaughter of Louis II of Anjou. The Anjou claim to Naples competes with Alfonso V's claim—marrying an Anjou would strain your Aragonese alliance significantly. Not recommended unless you wish to pivot away from Alfonso.\n\n\nMargaret of Burgundy or other Burgundian connections — The Duchy of Burgundy is powerful and semi-independent from France. A Burgundian match would not directly entangle you in the French-English war but would bring you into Burgundian politics, which are complex.\n\n\nEngland:\n\n\nThe English royal house is... troubled. Henry VI is a child-king, and the realm is managed by regents. There are no immediate English princesses of appropriate age. English noble families might offer candidates, but an English match risks French enmity.\n\n\nThe Empire:\n\n\nHabsburg connections — The Habsburgs control Austria and are rising in imperial politics. Duke Frederick V of Austria (future Emperor Frederick III) has sisters who might be of marriageable age. A Habsburg match would strengthen ties to the Empire and to Sigismund's political network.\n\n\nWittelsbach connections — The Bavarian Wittelsbachs are another powerful imperial family. I would need to research specific candidates.\n\n\nItaly:\n\n\nVisconti of Milan — Duke Filippo Maria Visconti has a daughter, Bianca Maria Visconti (born 1425, age 8). Too young for immediate marriage, but Milan is wealthy and powerful. However, Milan has been hostile to the Papacy and is currently at odds with Venice and Florence. A Visconti match would entangle you in Italian politics.\n\n\nNaples — If Alfonso V secures Naples, there may be Neapolitan noble families to consider, but no direct royal candidates.\n\n\n\nLesser Nobility\n\n\n\"If Your Majesty wishes to consider non-royal matches, the field widens considerably:\n\n\nCastilian nobility:\n\n\nThe great houses of Castile—Mendoza, Guzmán, Enríquez, Manrique—all have daughters. A Castilian match would:\n\n\nStrengthen ties to a specific noble faction\n\nRisk alienating rival factions\n\nProvide no external alliance benefit\n\nBut would be simpler, faster, and avoid foreign entanglements\n\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza has a granddaughter of marriageable age, I believe. His request for an audience may relate to this—the Mendozas positioning themselves.\n\n\nPortuguese nobility:\n\n\nHigh-ranking Portuguese nobles outside the royal family. Would maintain the Portuguese connection without the complications of marrying Isabel's sister.\n\n\nAragonese nobility:\n\n\nSimilar to Castilian matches—would strengthen the Aragonese alliance through a noble family rather than the crown directly.\n\n\n\nÁlvaro sits back.\n\n\n\"My preliminary recommendation, Your Majesty, would be to consider three paths:\n\n\nFirst choice: A Habsburg match. Ties to the Empire, to Sigismund's network, to central European politics. The Habsburgs are rising, and linking Castile to their fortunes could prove valuable for your Constantinople ambitions.\n\n\nSecond choice: Infanta Catarina of Portugal. Reinforces the existing alliance, honors Isabel's memory in a sense, keeps the Portuguese connection strong. But requires patience due to her age, and requires papal dispensation.\n\n\nThird choice: A Castilian great house. Fast, simple, fertile young wife from proven stock. Politically delicate but manageable. The Mendozas would be the obvious choice given Don Íñigo's loyalty and the Council of Great Houses.\n\n\nBut I would urge caution with any decision. This is not simply a marriage—it is a statement about Castile's future direction. Whatever choice you make, men will read meaning into it.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"Do any of these paths interest Your Majesty? Or shall I research specific candidates in more depth?\"\n\n\n\n[How do you wish to proceed?]"

      "say": "Álvaro nods slowly, his expression sharpening as the conversation turns to the complex web of Aragonese succession.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty raises a crucial question. Let me lay out the situation as it stands.\"\n\n\nHe rises and moves to the map of Iberia hanging on the wall, tracing the borders with his finger.\n\n\n\nThe Aragonese Succession\n\n\n\"King Alfonso V of Aragón is approximately forty years old. He has been married to María of Castile—your sister—for nearly eighteen years. They have no children, and by all accounts, the marriage is... distant. Alfonso spends his years pursuing Naples while María remains in Iberia. The likelihood of an heir from that union diminishes with each passing year.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to face you.\n\n\n\"Now, the succession. Before the deaths of the Infantes Juan and Enrique, the line was clear:\n\n\nAlfonso V (current king, childless)\n\nInfante Juan (next brother, now deceased)\n\nInfante Enrique (youngest brother, now deceased)\n\nCarlos, Prince of Viana (Infante Juan's son, also deceased—fever took him in early 1431)\n\n\nWith all three dead, the direct male Trastámara line of Aragón is extinguished after Alfonso.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro pauses to let this sink in.\n\n\n\"This creates a succession crisis that Alfonso has not publicly addressed. There are several potential claimants:\n\n\nFirst: Your sister María of Castile.\n\n\nAs Alfonso's wife and a daughter of the Trastámara house, she has a claim—though female succession in Aragón is... contested. The Crown of Aragón consists of multiple realms (Aragón proper, Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearics, Sicily, Sardinia), each with its own laws regarding female inheritance. Some allow it; others do not. A queen regnant would face challenges.\n\n\nSecond: You, through María.\n\n\nIf María inherits and has no children, you as her brother and nearest male Trastámara relative, could press a claim through her. Alternatively, if María were to renounce in your favor, or if she died childless, the claim could pass to you directly.\n\n\nThird: Fernando, your son.\n\n\nAn infant heir to Castile who could also be positioned as heir to Aragón—uniting the crowns in the next generation. This would require either formal adoption by Alfonso, designation as heir, or simply outliving all other claimants.\n\n\nFourth: Distant Trastámara relatives.\n\n\nThere are cadet branches—illegitimate lines, distant cousins. Their claims are weak but not nonexistent. If Alfonso dies without designating an heir, there could be a contested succession.\n\n\nFifth: Alfonso designates someone outside the family.\n\n\nUnlikely, but not impossible. He could attempt to leave Aragón to a trusted lieutenant or ally, though this would almost certainly provoke civil war.\"\n\n\n\nYour Claim\n\n\nÁlvaro returns to his seat, leaning forward.\n\n\n\"To answer your question directly, Your Majesty: yes, you have a strong claim to Aragón. Perhaps the strongest claim after Alfonso himself, given:\n\n\nThe extinction of the direct male line (the Infantes and Carlos)\n\nYour sister's position as Alfonso's queen\n\nYour own Trastámara blood (same dynasty that rules Aragón)\n\nYour existing alliance and good relations with Alfonso\n\nThe informal succession arrangement you discussed with Alfonso at Granada—where you offered to name him your heir if Isabel produced no son, and he would reciprocate\n\n\nThat conversation was never formalized, but Alfonso remembers it. You now have a son. The question is whether Alfonso will honor the spirit of that discussion and name Fernando—or you—as his heir.\"\n\n\nHe folds his hands.\n\n\n\"Now, to the matter of marriage. Would marrying an Aragonese woman strengthen your claim?\"\n\n\nÁlvaro considers carefully.\n\n\n\"It depends on which Aragonese woman.\n\n\nIf you married into one of the great Aragonese noble houses—the Cardona, the Luna (a distant branch of my own family, incidentally), the Centelles, the Urrea—you would gain:\n\n\nAllies within Aragón who would support your claim when the succession comes\n\nLocal knowledge and connections\n\nA wife who understands Aragonese law and custom\n\nPotentially, lands and vassals within Aragonese territory\n\n\nHowever, you would not gain additional blood claim. Your claim comes through your dynasty and your sister, not through marriage to a noblewoman.\n\n\nThe political benefit would be substantial. The legal benefit to your succession claim would be minimal.\n\n\nThere is also a risk: if you marry an Aragonese noblewoman, you elevate one faction within Aragón above others. The families you do not choose may resent this and oppose your eventual succession.\"\n\n\n\nA Different Path\n\n\nÁlvaro hesitates, then speaks more carefully.\n\n\n\"There is another consideration, Your Majesty. One that isindelicate but must be voiced.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\n\"Your sister María is Queen of Aragón. She is childless, unhappy, and has spent nearly two decades in a loveless marriage while her husband chases glory in Italy. If Alfonso were to die—or if the marriage were somehow dissolved—María herself becomes a pivotal figure.\n\n\nSome might suggest... but no.\" He shakes his head. \"That path leads to accusations of conspiracy. If anything were to happen to Alfonso, and you benefited, tongues would wag regardless of your innocence.\n\n\nThe cleanest path is this: maintain your alliance with Alfonso. Support his Naples campaign as you promised. Let him grow old without heirs. When he dies—whether in five years or twenty—your claim will be uncontested if you have cultivated Aragonese support and remained his faithful ally.\n\n\nMarrying an Aragonese noblewoman could help with that cultivation. But it is a long game, Your Majesty. A very long game.\"\n\n\nHe sits back.\n\n\n\"Do you wish me to research specific Aragonese noble families and their eligible daughters? Or does Your Majesty wish to consider other options first?\"\n\n\n\n[How do you wish to proceed?]"

This makes her a princess of the blood but not in the direct line of succession.

The physicians would note this as a concern.\n\nExceptional (96) grants two bonus traits:\nFertility concerns again (89) — This reinforces the worry. Her family line has genuine problems bearing children. Multiple women in her lineage have died in childbirth or produced only one or two children.\n\nWorldly (29) — More interested in court pleasures than prayer. Enjoys music, dancing, fine clothes, and the social whirl of noble life.\n\n\nPolitical Stance: Open (65) — The French court would negotiate in good faith, neither desperate nor hostile.\n\n\nSummary: A Valois princess of marriageable age, pleasant-looking, who enjoys courtly life—but with serious fertility concerns that run in her bloodline. Given Isabel's death in childbirth, this would be a significant risk.\n\n\n\nCandidate 2 — Valois Niece, Age 19\n\n\nRelation: 4 — Niece of Charles VII (same situation as Candidate 1—possibly her sister, or a cousin from another branch)\n\n\nAge: 19 — Prime childbearing age, excellent\n\n\nAppearance: Below average (24) — Not ugly, but notably plain.

Court poets do not write verses about her.\n\n\nTraits:\n\n\nRobust health (19) — Hardy constitution, rarely ill, built for childbearing\n\nIgnorant (38) — Minimal education even by the standards of noblewomen. Cannot read Latin, possibly struggles with reading at all.

Would not be a political partner.\n\n\nPolitical Stance: Open (43) — Willing to negotiate, no special eagerness or reluctance.\n\n\nSummary: A plain, simple woman—but healthy as a horse. She would likely bear children without difficulty and would not meddle in politics. However, she could never be a partner in governance the way Isabel was becoming. She would be a broodmare, not a queen in the fullest sense.\n\n\n\nCandidate 3 — Marie d'Alençon, Age 18\n\n\nHouse: Alençon — A cadet branch of the Valois, Dukes of Alençon. The current Duke, Jean II d'Alençon, fought alongside Joan of Arc and was captured by the English at Verneuil (1424). The family has spent years paying ruinous ransoms and recovering from military disasters.\n\n\nAge: 18 — Ideal for immediate marriage\n\n\nAppearance: Plain (18) — Unattractive by court standards. Perhaps a prominent nose, pockmarks from childhood illness, or simply unfortunate bone structure. Not ugly enough to cause comment, but no one would call her pretty.\n\n\nTraits:\n\n\nRobust health (19) — Strong constitution despite her plain looks\n\nEducated (34) — Reads Latin, knows literature and history\n\nEducated again, rerolled to Musical (32) — Plays instruments, sings beautifully. Her education extends to the arts.\n\n\nPolitical Stance: Desperate (97) — House Alençon is in dire straits. The ransoms, the war losses, the family's reduced circumstances—they would leap at a Castilian royal match. They would offer favorable terms, demand little, and be profoundly grateful.\n\n\nSummary: A plain but healthy woman with genuine intellectual gifts—she reads, she thinks, she makes music. House Alençon's desperation means the match would be easy to arrange on favorable terms. She could be a genuine companion, someone to talk with, even if she would never turn heads at court. Her family's gratitude would make them loyal allies.\n\n\n\nFrance Summary Table\n\nCandidate\nHouse\nAge\nAppearance\nKey Traits\nPolitical Stance\n1\nValois (Niece)\n18\nAverage\nWorldly, serious fertility concerns\nOpen\n2\nValois (Niece)\n19\nBelow Average\nRobust health, Ignorant, Politically naive\nOpen\n3\nAlençon\n18\nPlain\nRobust health, Educated, Musical\nDesperate\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\nCandidate 1 offers the closest tie to the French throne but carries dangerous fertility risks—especially given how Isabel died.\n\n\nCandidate 2 is the safest choice for producing heirs but would be a wife in body only, not a partner in mind or spirit.\n\n\nCandidate 3 is the most intriguing—plain but intelligent, healthy, cultured, and from a family that would be deeply loyal.

A minor house candidate with a royal connection suggests something unusual—perhaps a legitimized bastard line, a morganatic marriage, a distant cadet branch, or some other circumstance that places royal blood in a less prominent family.\n\n\n\nRoyal Connection Table (d100)\n\nRoll\nNature of Royal Connection\n1-15\nLegitimized Bastard Line — Descended from an acknowledged illegitimate child of a Lancastrian prince. Bears royal blood but barred from succession. The family was given minor lands and a modest title in exchange for renouncing all claims.\n16-30\nMorganatic Descent — A royal prince secretly married a commoner or minor noblewoman; the children were acknowledged but not given royal status. The family keeps quiet about the connection but it is documented.\n31-45\nMaternal Royal Blood — Her mother or grandmother was a royal princess who married \"down\" into a minor house due to scandal, poverty, or political necessity. The blood is legitimate but the family is not.\n46-60\nBeaufort Cadet Branch — Descended from a younger or illegitimate Beaufort line. The Beauforts themselves are legitimized bastards of John of Gaunt; this family is another step removed. Royal blood twice-diluted but still present.\n61-70\nWidow's Daughter — Her mother was a royal widow who remarried into a minor house. She is half-sister to someone of royal blood, or her stepfather adopted her into his lesser family. Complex but genuine connection.\n71-80\nYorkist Side Branch — Distant connection to the House of York through a female line or younger son. Given the Yorkist claim to the throne, this could be politically sensitive.\n81-90\nGloucester's Natural Daughter — Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (current Lord Protector) has no legitimate children but has had mistresses. If this candidate is his acknowledged illegitimate daughter, she carries no succession rights but significant political weight during the regency.\n91-95\nHidden Legitimacy — The family claims, with some documentary evidence, that a marriage everyone thought was invalid was actually legitimate. If true, she might have a genuine (if contested) claim to royal status. Potentially explosive.\n96-100\nDirect But Disgraced — She is the legitimate daughter or granddaughter of a royal prince who was attainted (stripped of titles for treason). The blood is unquestionably royal, but the family name is tainted. Rehabilitation is possible but politically fraught.\n\n\nPlease roll d100 to determine the nature of this extraordinary royal connection.\n\n\nAfter that, roll 3d8 for the other three minor house candidates (their family types from the previous table).\n\n\nThen we proceed to full candidate details for all four."

      "say": "ENGLAND: Final Results\n\n\nCandidate 1 — Legitimized Lancastrian Bastard Line\n\n\nRoyal Connection: Descended from an acknowledged illegitimate child of a Lancastrian prince—most likely a bastard son of John of Gaunt (grandfather of Henry VI) or one of his sons. The family was given a modest barony and small estates in exchange for formally renouncing all claims to the throne. They bear the royal blood but are legally excluded from succession.\n\n\nFamily Type: Minor baronial house with royal blood\n\n\nAge: 28 — Older, but still within childbearing years. Likely a widow, or a woman whose marriage prospects were complicated by her unusual status.\n\n\nAppearance: 86 — Beautiful. Renowned for her looks, praised at court. The Lancastrian blood shows in fine features, and despite her family's minor status, men have noticed her. Poets have written verses.\n\n\nTraits:\n\n\nWorldly (26) — More interested in court pleasures than prayer. She has spent years navigating the edges of royal society, attending feasts and entertainments without ever quite belonging.\n\nGentle-natured (57) — Kind, soft-spoken, unlikely to cause conflict. Her years in an awkward position have taught her to smooth over tensions rather than create them.\n\nPolitically astute (74) — Understands power, could be a valuable advisor. Growing up adjacent to royalty without being royal has given her sharp insight into how courts actually function.\n\n\nFamily Political Stance: 1 — Hostile.\n\n\nThis is striking. Despite their minor status, the family opposes a Castilian match. Why?\n\n\nPossible reasons: They have cultivated their position carefully for generations, maintaining ties to the Lancastrian regime. A foreign marriage would remove their daughter from English politics entirely. They may hope to marry her to an English lord who could elevate the family further. Or perhaps they fear that drawing attention to their royal blood through such a prominent match could be dangerous—reminding people that bastard lines exist is not always wise.\n\n\nRegency Council: 22 — Council Divided.\n\n\nSome councillors see value in an Iberian connection; others oppose sending even minor royal blood abroad. Duke Humphrey of Gloucester might support it (removing a potential complication), while Cardinal Beaufort might oppose (the Beauforts are themselves a legitimized bastard line and may not want precedents set).\n\n\nSummary: A beautiful, intelligent, politically savvy woman of 28 with genuine Lancastrian blood. She would be a true partner—charming, insightful, gentle. But her family actively opposes the match, and the regency council is divided. Winning her hand would require overcoming significant English resistance. Her age means children are possible but time is limited.\n\n\n\nCandidate 2 — Cadet Branch of Great House, Age 32\n\n\nFamily Type: 6 — Cadet branch of a great house. Distant cousins to one of the premier noble families—perhaps a younger son's line from the Mowbrays (Norfolk), Staffords (Buckingham), or de la Poles (Suffolk). The name carries weight; the actual power does not.\n\n\nAge: 32 — Old for a first marriage. Almost certainly a widow, possibly with children from a previous marriage. At the outer edge of childbearing but not impossible.\n\n\nAppearance: 90 — Beautiful. Strikingly so. Even at 32, she turns heads. Her beauty may be why she married well the first time, and why she remains discussed at court even now.\n\n\nTraits:\n\n\nSickly (14) — Prone to illness, frequently unwell. This may explain why she has not remarried despite her beauty and connections. Fertility is a serious concern.\n\nPolitically naive (79) — Does not understand or care about intrigue. Despite her years at court, she has never grasped the games being played around her.\n\nExceptional (96) — Roll twice more for additional positive traits.\n\n\nBonus Traits Needed: Please roll 2d100 for her exceptional bonus traits.\n\n\nFamily Political Stance: 86 — Eager.\n\n\nThe family sees a Castilian royal match as a tremendous opportunity. Their branch has languished in the shadow of their greater cousins for generations. Marrying into Iberian royalty would elevate them dramatically. They will offer favorable terms.\n\n\nRegency Council: 51 — Council Indifferent.\n\n\nA minor cadet branch marrying abroad is a private family matter. The council has no official position.\n\n\nSummary (Pending Bonus Traits): A beautiful widow of 32 from a respectable but powerless family. Her looks are remarkable, her family is eager, but she is frequently ill and not politically clever. Her age and health make her a risky choice for producing heirs.\n\n\n\nCandidate 3 — Cadet Branch of Great House, Age 12\n\n\nFamily Type: 5 — Cadet branch of a great house. Similar to Candidate 2—distant cousins to a major family, respectable name without real power.\n\n\nAge: 12 — Very young. Marriage would need to wait 2-4 years before consummation. Children would not come for at least 3-5 years.\n\n\nAppearance: 22 — Below average. A plain child who may grow into her features, or may not. At 12, it is difficult to judge what she will become.\n\n\nTraits:\n\n\nWorldly (30) — Already more interested in court pleasures than prayer. Precocious, perhaps. Drawn to fashion, entertainment, gossip.\n\nArtistic (50) — Draws, embroiders exceptionally. Shows genuine talent that her family has cultivated.\n\nNo special trait (5) — Nothing else distinguishes her yet.\n\n\nFamily Political Stance: 65 — Open.\n\n\nThe family would negotiate in good faith. A royal match for a 12-year-old daughter from a minor branch would be a significant elevation, but they are not desperate.\n\n\nRegency Council: 55 — Council Indifferent.\n\n\nNo official position on a minor house's marriage arrangements.\n\n\nSummary: A plain, artistic, somewhat worldly child of 12. She is too young for immediate marriage, and her appearance is unremarkable. Her only real advantage is youth—if you are willing to wait, she has many childbearing years ahead. But you would be waiting years for a girl who may never become beautiful or particularly capable.\n\n\n\nCandidate 4 — Baronial Family, Age 27\n\n\nFamily Type: 1 — Baronial family. Minor lords with small estates, respectable but not powerful. Old enough lineage to be considered proper nobility, but no one of significance.\n\n\nAge: 27 — Older, likely a widow. Still within childbearing years but time is not unlimited.\n\n\nAppearance: 60 — Average, at the upper edge. Pleasant-looking, perhaps pretty in good light. Not remarkable but not plain either.\n\n\nTraits:\n\n\nMusical (46) — Plays instruments, sings beautifully. A genuine accomplishment that would grace any court.\n\nScandal attached (92) — Some rumor or past incident clouds her reputation. This requires further definition.\n\nSecret (98) — She has a hidden quality. Roll again; this trait is concealed from initial reports.\n\n\nScandal and Secret Needed: Please roll 2d100:\n\n\nFirst roll: Nature of the scandal (I will create a quick table)\n\nSecond roll: Her secret hidden trait\n\n\nFamily Political Stance: 49 — Cautious.\n\n\nInterested but wary. The distance to Castile concerns them, as does leaving England during wartime. They will negotiate carefully.\n\n\nRegency Council: 46 — Council Indifferent.\n\n\nA minor baron's daughter marrying abroad draws no official attention.\n\n\n\nRolls Still Needed\n\n\nCandidate 2 (Cadet branch beauty):\n\n\n2d100 for her Exceptional bonus traits\n\n\nCandidate 4 (Baronial widow with scandal):\n\n\n2d100 — First for scandal type, second for her secret trait\n\n\n\nScandal Table (d100)\n\nRoll\nNature of Scandal\n1-20\nBroken Betrothal — She was engaged and the engagement was dissolved under unclear circumstances. Whispers of fault on her side.\n21-40\nRumored Affair — Gossip links her name romantically to someone inappropriate—a married man, a priest, a social inferior. May be true or false.\n41-55\nFamily Disgrace — The scandal is not hers but her family's—a father or brother attainted, disgraced, or executed. She is tainted by association.\n56-70\nFinancial Irregularity — Her previous marriage or her family involved questionable financial dealings. Debts, broken contracts, accusations of fraud.\n71-85\nReligious Suspicion — Whispers of heretical sympathy, Lollard connections, or inappropriate religious behavior. In 1430s England, this is dangerous.\n86-95\nMysterious Death — Her previous husband or a close family member died under suspicious circumstances. No proof of wrongdoing, but tongues wag.\n96-100\nForeign Entanglement — She or her family had connections to France, Scotland, or other enemies of England. Accusations of divided loyalty.\n\n\nPlease roll:\n\n\n2d100 for Candidate 2's bonus traits\n\n2d100 for Candidate 4's scandal and secret trait"

Perhaps her father was accused of falsifying accounts, breaking contracts with merchants, or owing money to powerful creditors. The specifics are murky, but the stain remains. Respectable English families have hesitated to associate with her, which explains why a reasonably attractive musical widow of 27 remains unmarried.\n\n\nThe irony: the financial troubles may make her family more interested in a wealthy foreign match that would take her far from English gossip.\n\n\nSecret Trait (73): Politically Astute\n\n\nBeneath the surface of a pleasant, musical widow touched by scandal lies a sharp mind. She understands power—who has it, how it flows, how it can be gained and lost. Perhaps navigating her family's financial disgrace taught her hard lessons about how the world really works. Perhaps she simply watches and listens more than she speaks.\n\n\nThis trait is hidden. Initial reports would describe her as a minor baron's daughter, pretty enough, musically gifted, unfortunately touched by scandal.

Her family's financial scandal has damaged her marriage prospects in England. Beneath the surface, she is politically astute—a hidden asset that would only emerge over time. Her family is cautious but interested; the regency council doesn't care.

      "say": "BURGUNDY: Final Results\n\n\nStep 1 Result: 81 — Four Major Houses Have Eligible Daughters\n\n\nThe wealthy Burgundian court produces four potential matches from significant families. This is a strong showing—Duke Philip's expanding realm has created numerous marriage-worthy noblewomen.\n\n\nStep 2: Houses Determined\n\n\nYou rolled: 1, 4, 5, 3 → Burgundy Ducal Connection, Luxembourg, Charolais nobles, Cleves\n\n\nAnd for the Ducal Connection: 1 → Illegitimate but acknowledged daughter of Philip the Good himself.\n\n\nThis is significant. Philip the Good is notorious for his many mistresses and has fathered numerous bastards. An acknowledged illegitimate daughter carries no succession rights but bears the blood of the most powerful duke in Christendom.\n\n\n\nCandidate 1 — Illegitimate Daughter of Philip the Good, Age 24\n\n\nFamily: Direct illegitimate issue of Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy. Her mother was likely a noblewoman or high-born mistress—Philip acknowledged her and provided for her upbringing at court. She has been raised among luxury and sophistication but can never inherit or claim legitimate status.\n\n\nAge: 24 — Prime childbearing age, mature and experienced in court life.\n\n\nAppearance: 52 — Average. Pleasant enough, typical noble features. Neither beautiful nor plain—she does not stand out in the glittering Burgundian court but is presentable.\n\n\nTraits:\n\n\nWorldly (27) — More interested in court pleasures than prayer. She has grown up in the most splendid court in Europe, surrounded by feasts, tournaments, art, and intrigue. Piety is not her strength.\n\nContent (66) — Happy with whatever role she is given. Her illegitimate status has taught her to accept her place without resentment. She does not grasp for more than she is offered.\n\nFertile family (82) — Her mother bore multiple children (likely other bastards by Philip or children from other relationships). Philip's own mother, Margaret of Bavaria, had many children. The bloodline is proven fertile.\n\n\nFamily Political Stance: 54 — Open.\n\n\nPhilip would negotiate in good faith for his daughter's marriage. An illegitimate daughter married to a foreign king is no threat to Burgundian succession and could create useful diplomatic ties.\n\n\nDuke Philip's Approval: 33 — Duke Indifferent.\n\n\nThis is a private family matter. Philip has many illegitimate children to place; one more marriage negotiation is routine. He will not obstruct but will not actively support either. The match would proceed without ducal enthusiasm but without ducal opposition.\n\n\nSummary: A 24-year-old illegitimate daughter of the most powerful duke in Europe. Average in appearance, worldly in temperament, content with her lot, and from proven fertile stock. She carries Philip the Good's blood but not his legitimacy. The match would be easy to arrange—no opposition, no enthusiasm. She would be a pleasant, unambitious wife who enjoys courtly pleasures and would likely bear children without difficulty. But she brings no alliance, no territory, no political weight beyond the Burgundian connection.\n\n\n\nCandidate 2 — House of Luxembourg, Age 20\n\n\nFamily: The House of Luxembourg is one of the most ancient and prestigious in Europe. They have produced Holy Roman Emperors (including the current Emperor Sigismund, who is of the Luxembourg line). The Burgundian branch maintains close ties to both the Empire and Duke Philip's court.\n\n\nAge: 20 — Ideal childbearing age, young but mature.\n\n\nAppearance: 24 — Below average. Plain features, perhaps a long face or unfortunate complexion. The Luxembourg blood has produced emperors but not beauties.\n\n\nTraits:\n\n\nExceptional (100) — Roll twice more for additional positive traits. This woman has hidden depths.\nFirst bonus trait: 6 — No special trait (the dice giveth and taketh)\n\nSecond bonus trait: 69 — Content. Happy with whatever role given.\n\nNo special trait (6) — Nothing else distinguishes her on first meeting.\n\nContent (69) — Reinforced. She is notably content, accepting, and without ambition.\n\nPolitically astute (72) — Understands power, could be valuable advisor. Beneath her plain, content exterior lies a sharp mind that has watched imperial and ducal politics her entire life.\n\nScandal attached (91) — Some rumor or incident clouds her reputation.\n\n\nScandal Required: Please roll d100 on the scandal table below:\n\nRoll\nNature of Scandal\n1-20\nBroken Betrothal — Engagement dissolved under unclear circumstances\n21-40\nRumored Affair — Gossip links her to someone inappropriate\n41-55\nFamily Disgrace — A relative's disgrace taints her by association\n56-70\nFinancial Irregularity — Family involved in questionable dealings\n71-85\nReligious Suspicion — Whispers of heresy or inappropriate beliefs\n86-95\nMysterious Death — Someone close died under suspicious circumstances\n96-100\nForeign Entanglement — Connections to enemies or divided loyalty\n\nFamily Political Stance: 71 — Eager.\n\n\nThe Luxembourg family sees a Castilian royal match as highly advantageous. Despite their imperial connections, they are not currently in the inner circle of power. Marriage to the King of Castile—conqueror of Granada, ally of Pope and Emperor—would elevate them significantly.\n\n\nDuke Philip's Approval: 60 — Duke Approves.\n\n\nPhilip sees diplomatic value in connecting Burgundy to Castile through a Luxembourg match. The Luxembourgs are useful allies, and strengthening their position through a Spanish marriage costs him nothing while potentially gaining him Iberian goodwill.\n\n\nSummary (Pending Scandal): A 20-year-old from one of Europe's most prestigious families—the blood of emperors. Plain in appearance, seemingly unremarkable in personality, but with a sharp political mind hidden beneath her contented demeanor. Her family is eager; Duke Philip approves. However, some scandal attaches to her name. She could be a valuable partner despite her looks—a woman who understands power and is content to wield it quietly.\n\n\n\nCandidate 3 — Charolais Nobles, Age 13\n\n\nFamily: The County of Charolais is held directly by the Duke of Burgundy, and its noble families are among the closest to the ducal court. This candidate comes from one of the premier Charolais families—wealthy, influential within Burgundy, and deeply loyal to Philip the Good.\n\n\nAge: 13 — Very young. Marriage would need to wait 1-2 years, children 2-4 years away.\n\n\nAppearance: 90 — Beautiful. Even at 13, she is strikingly lovely—the kind of beauty that will only grow as she matures. She is already noticed at court, and her family knows her looks are an asset.\n\n\nTraits:\n\n\nPious (22) — Deeply religious for her age. Drawn to prayer, devotion, and religious observance. Her family may have considered a convent before recognizing her marriage value.\n\nPolitically naive (77) — Does not understand or care about intrigue. At 13, this is unsurprising—she has not yet learned the ways of courts.\n\nGentle-natured (56) — Kind, soft-spoken, unlikely to cause conflict. A sweet-tempered girl.\n\n\nFamily Political Stance: 65 — Open.\n\n\nThe family would negotiate in good faith. A royal match for their beautiful young daughter is a tremendous opportunity, but they are not desperate.\n\n\nDuke Philip's Approval: 72 — Duke Supports.\n\n\nPhilip actively encourages this match. The Charolais nobles are his loyal vassals; strengthening their ties to Castile strengthens Burgundy's Iberian connections. He may offer to enhance the dowry or provide additional diplomatic support.\n\n\nSummary: A beautiful, pious, gentle 13-year-old from a prominent Burgundian noble family. She is too young for immediate marriage but would grow into a lovely, devout wife. Duke Philip actively supports the match. However, she is politically naive—likely to remain so unless educated—and her extreme youth means years of waiting. She would be a sweet companion and a beautiful queen, but not a political partner.\n\n\n\nCandidate 4 — House of Cleves, Age 12\n\n\nFamily: The Duchy of Cleves lies on the German-Burgundian border, connected to Burgundy through marriage alliances. The Dukes of Cleves are significant regional powers with ties to both the Empire and the Low Countries. A Cleves match would connect Castile to the lower Rhine region.\n\n\nAge: 12 — Very young. Marriage would need to wait 2-4 years, children further still.\n\n\nAppearance: 49 — Average. An ordinary-looking child who may grow into her features or may remain unremarkable.\n\n\nTraits:\n\n\nNo special trait (8) — Nothing distinguishes her yet.\n\nFertile family (82) — Her mother and grandmother had many children. The Cleves bloodline is proven fertile.\n\nPolitically astute (75) — Understands power, could be valuable advisor. Remarkably perceptive for a 12-year-old—she watches, listens, and comprehends the games being played around her.\n\n\nFamily Political Stance: 54 — Open.\n\n\nThe Cleves family would negotiate in good faith. A Castilian match is attractive but they have other options and will not appear desperate.\n\n\nDuke Philip's Approval: 66 — Duke Approves.\n\n\nPhilip sees value in the match. Cleves is a useful buffer on his eastern border, and strengthening their ties to Castile through Burgundian mediation serves his interests.\n\n\nSummary: A 12-year-old from the House of Cleves—average-looking, from fertile stock, with a surprisingly sharp political mind for her age. Too young for immediate marriage. Her family is open to negotiation; Duke Philip approves. She could grow into a valuable political partner if her intelligence is cultivated, but she is younger and plainer than the Charolais candidate.\n\n\n\nBurgundy Summary Table (Pending Candidate 2's Scandal)\n\nCandidate\nHouse\nAge\nAppearance\nKey Traits\nFamily Stance\nDuke's Approval\n1\nPhilip's Bastard\n24\nAverage\nWorldly, Content, Fertile family\nOpen\nIndifferent\n2\nLuxembourg\n20\nBelow Average\nContent, Politically astute, Scandal\nEager\nApproves\n3\nCharolais\n13\nBeautiful\nPious, Gentle, Politically naive\nOpen\nSupports\n4\nCleves\n12\nAverage\nFertile family, Politically astute\nOpen\nApproves\n\n\nRoll Still Needed\n\n\nCandidate 2 (Luxembourg):\n\n\nd100 for the nature of her scandal"

The whispers circulate through the Burgundian court—perhaps a married nobleman, perhaps a man far below her station, perhaps someone connected to a rival faction. The truth is unclear; these things always are. She may be entirely innocent, the victim of malicious tongues. Or there may be some kernel of truth buried beneath the exaggeration.\n\n\nWhat is certain: the rumor exists, and it has damaged her marriage prospects among the high nobility of Burgundy and the Empire. A Luxembourg daughter of her age and lineage should have been married years ago. Instead, she remains unwed at 20, her family eager to find a match far enough away that the gossip will not follow.\n\n\nThis explains why her family is so eager (71) for a Castilian match—a king across the Pyrenees is unlikely to have heard the whispers, and distance will bury the scandal.\n\n\nComplete Summary: A 20-year-old from the House of Luxembourg—blood of emperors, one of Europe's most ancient lineages. Plain in appearance, seemingly unremarkable and content, but with a sharp political mind hidden beneath her placid exterior. A rumored affair has damaged her reputation in Burgundian circles, leaving her unmarried despite her prestigious birth. Her family is eager to place her somewhere the scandal cannot follow; Duke Philip approves of the match. She could be a genuinely valuable partner—intelligent, understanding of power, content to work behind the scenes—but you would be marrying a woman touched by gossip, and the truth of that gossip remains unknown.\n\n\n\nBurgundy Final Summary Table\n\nCandidate\nHouse\nAge\nAppearance\nKey Traits\nFamily Stance\nDuke's Approval\n1\nPhilip's Bastard\n24\nAverage\nWorldly, Content, Fertile family\nOpen\nIndifferent\n2\nLuxembourg\n20\nBelow Average\nContent, Politically astute, Rumored affair\nEager\nApproves\n3\nCharolais\n13\nBeautiful\nPious, Gentle, Politically naive\nOpen\nSupports\n4\nCleves\n12\nAverage\nFertile family, Politically astute\nOpen\nApproves\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\nCandidate 1 (Philip's Bastard) offers the easiest path—no obstacles, proven fertility, pleasant temperament—but brings nothing politically. She is a safe, unambitious choice for a man who simply wants children and a content household.\n\n\nCandidate 2 (Luxembourg) is the most intriguing. Imperial blood, political intelligence, an eager family, and ducal approval—but a scandal that may or may not be deserved. If the rumor is false, she is an excellent match. If true... questions arise about her character.\n\n\nCandidate 3 (Charolais) is the beauty—strikingly lovely, sweet-natured, devoutly pious. Duke Philip actively supports the match. But she is only 13, politically naive, and years away from bearing children. A long-term investment in a young girl who may never develop into a political partner.\n\n\nCandidate 4 (Cleves) is similar to Candidate 3 but less beautiful and more intelligent. At 12, she is even younger, but her political sharpness is remarkable for her age. If cultivated, she could become a true partner—but you would be waiting many years.\n\n\n\nShall we proceed to the Empire (Habsburgs and other families) next?"

It is not a unified state but a complex web of principalities, duchies, free cities, and ecclesiastical territories, all nominally under the Emperor.\n\n\nThe Imperial Situation:\n\n\nEmperor Sigismund of Luxembourg (age 65) — The current Emperor, whom Juan met at Como. He has no legitimate male heir. His daughter Elisabeth is married to Albrecht of Austria (Habsburg).\n\nThe Habsburg Rise — The Habsburgs of Austria are emerging as the dominant imperial family.

      "say": "Step 1 Result: 7 — Almost Nothing Available\n\n\nThe Imperial nobility is preoccupied. The Hussite wars drag on in Bohemia. The great princes maneuver for advantage in anticipation of Sigismund's death—the old Emperor is 65 and has no male heir. The Habsburgs are consolidating their position. The Wittelsbachs and Wettins eye each other warily. No one is looking toward distant Iberia for marriage alliances.\n\n\nThe timing is poor. Had Juan arrived in the Empire a year earlier, or perhaps a year later when the political situation clarifies, options might exist. But in the summer of 1433, the great houses of the Empire have their daughters committed, promised, or held in reserve for German matches that serve immediate political needs.\n\n\n\nWhat This Means\n\n\nNo major Imperial candidates are currently available.\n\n\nÁlvaro would report this with a mixture of disappointment and pragmatism:\n\n\n\"The Empire offers nothing at present, Your Majesty. I have made inquiries through our contacts—merchants who trade in the Rhine cities, clergy with German connections, even a discreet letter to a knight who served with the Imperial delegation at Como. The answer is the same everywhere: the great families are not looking outward. They are consumed by their own affairs.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"This may change. Emperor Sigismund spoke highly of you at Como. If you wished to pursue an Imperial match, a direct appeal to Sigismund himself might open doors that are currently closed. He could... encourage... one of his vassals to consider a Castilian alliance. But that would be asking a favor, and favors from Emperors come with expectations attached.\"\n\n\n\nOptions\n\n\nAccept that the Empire offers nothing now — Move on to other candidates (France, Burgundy, or reconsider England).\n\nMake a direct appeal to Emperor Sigismund — Write to him personally, invoking your relationship from Como, asking him to facilitate an Imperial match. This would require a roll to see if he is willing and able to produce a candidate.\n\nWait and revisit later — The Imperial situation may change. After Sigismund's death (historically 1437), the political landscape will shift dramatically.\n\n\n\nWhat would you like to do? Shall we compile the final summary of all available candidates from France, England, and Burgundy? Or do you wish to appeal to Sigismund directly?"

      "say": "ITALY: Marriage Candidate Generation\n\n\nHistorical Context (1433)\n\n\nItaly in 1433 is not a unified state but a patchwork of competing powers—wealthy, sophisticated, and constantly at war with one another. The Italian peninsula is the cultural and economic heart of Europe, home to the Renaissance's first flowering, the papacy, and the wealthiest banking houses in Christendom.\n\n\nMajor Italian Powers:\n\n\nThe Papal States — Pope Eugenius IV rules central Italy from Rome (when he can—he's currently in conflict with the Council of Basel and Roman nobility). The papal court includes many noble families with marriageable daughters.\n\nThe Kingdom of Naples — Currently contested between René of Anjou (French claimant) and Alfonso V of Aragón (Juan's ally). Naples is the only Italian kingdom—the rest are duchies, republics, or city-states. Alfonso's involvement complicates any Neapolitan match.\n\nThe Duchy of Milan — Ruled by Filippo Maria Visconti (age 41), the richest and most powerful Italian state. Visconti is paranoid, reclusive, and has only one child—his illegitimate daughter Bianca Maria (age 8). Milan is expansionist and aggressive.\n\nThe Republic of Venice — La Serenissima, the great maritime republic. Ruled by the Doge and the merchant oligarchy. Venetian noble families are immensely wealthy but traditionally marry among themselves. Foreign matches are rare but not unknown.\n\nThe Republic of Florence — Dominated by the Medici banking family (Cosimo de' Medici is the effective ruler). Technically a republic, effectively an oligarchy. The great Florentine families are merchants, not nobility—a Florentine match would be wealthy but socially unconventional.\n\nThe Republic of Genoa — Venice's great rival, a maritime power with colonies across the Mediterranean. Currently weakened and often subject to Milanese influence. Genoese noble families are wealthy but fractious.\n\nThe Duchy of Savoy — Controls the Alpine passes between Italy and France/Burgundy. Duke Amadeus VIII is one of the most respected rulers in Europe (he will later become the antipope Felix V). The Savoyards are connected to virtually every royal house.\n\nThe Marquessate of Montferrat — Small but strategic territory in northwestern Italy. The Palaeologan dynasty of Montferrat is connected to the Byzantine imperial family.\n\nThe Marquessate of Ferrara/Este — The Este family rules Ferrara, Modena, and Reggio. Cultured, sophisticated, patrons of the arts.\n\nThe Duchy of Mantua/Gonzaga — The Gonzaga family rules Mantua. Military reputation, cultured court, strategic location.\n\n\nSpecial Considerations: Italy and Castile\n\n\nAn Italian match would have complex implications:\n\n\nPositive: Italian wealth, culture, and sophistication\n\nPositive: Mediterranean connections useful for Constantinople plans\n\nPositive: Papal connections could strengthen Church relations\n\nPositive: Savoy connection could provide Alpine passage rights\n\nNegative: Alfonso V's Naples war means any Neapolitan involvement is complicated\n\nNegative: Italian politics are notoriously treacherous—marriage could entangle Castile in peninsular wars\n\nNegative: Italian families (except Savoy and Naples) are technically not royal—social status concerns\n\nComplex: Venice and Genoa control Mediterranean trade routes to Constantinople\n\n\n\nRolling Framework\n\n\nStep 1: Available Houses (d100)\n\nRoll\nResult\n1-10\nAlmost nothing available—Italian powers focused on their own wars\n11-20\nOnly minor families available—wealthy but no political weight\n21-35\nOne major house has an eligible candidate\n36-55\nTwo major houses have eligible candidates\n56-75\nThree major houses have eligible candidates\n76-88\nFour major houses have eligible candidates\n89-95\nFive major houses have eligible candidates\n96-100\nExceptional—six or more houses, including a highly prestigious candidate (Savoy, Visconti heir, or papal connection)\n\nStep 2: Which Houses?

      "say": "ITALY: Final Results\n\n\nStep 1 Result: 45 — Two Major Houses Have Eligible Candidates\n\n\nThe Italian powers are absorbed in their own affairs—Milan's expansion, Venice's wars, Florence's internal politics—but two significant families have daughters available for foreign matches.\n\n\nStep 2: Houses Determined\n\n\nYou rolled: 4, 3 → Gonzaga of Mantua, Este of Ferrara\n\n\nTwo of the most cultured courts in Italy. Both families are renowned patrons of the arts, sophisticated in politics, and strategically positioned in the Po Valley. These are not royal families, but they are among the most prestigious in the Italian peninsula.\n\n\n\nCandidate 1 — Gonzaga of Mantua, Age 12\n\n\nFamily: The Gonzaga family has ruled Mantua since 1328. They are condottieri nobility—their wealth and power built on military contracts and strategic marriages. The current Marquess, Gianfrancesco Gonzaga, has transformed Mantua into a center of Renaissance culture, hiring Vittorino da Feltre to educate his children in the new humanist learning.\n\n\nAge: 12 — Very young. Marriage would need to wait 2-3 years, children further still.\n\n\nAppearance: 22 — Below average. A plain child, perhaps gawky and awkward at this age. She may grow into her features, or she may remain unremarkable.\n\n\nTraits:\n\n\nExceptional (99) — Roll twice more for additional positive traits.\nFirst bonus trait: 34 — Educated. Reads Latin, knows literature and history. At the Gonzaga court under Vittorino da Feltre's influence, this is expected—she has received one of the finest educations available to any woman in Europe.\n\nSecond bonus trait: 88 — Fertility concerns. Despite her youth, her family history shows problems—difficult births, few children, maternal deaths. The Gonzaga line has struggled to produce heirs consistently.\n\nEducated (34) — Reinforced. She is exceptionally well-educated, trained in Latin, Greek, literature, history, mathematics, and rhetoric. Vittorino da Feltre's methods have produced a genuinely learned young woman.\n\nFertility concerns (88) — Reinforced. This is now a serious red flag. Multiple indicators suggest childbearing will be difficult or dangerous for her.\n\nContent (70) — Happy with whatever role she is given. Her humanist education has instilled acceptance and equanimity.\n\nRobust health (17) — Despite the fertility concerns in her lineage, she herself is healthy and hardy. This creates an interesting tension—she is personally strong, but her bloodline struggles to bear children.\n\n\nFamily Political Stance: 18 — Reluctant.\n\n\nThe Gonzaga prefer Italian matches. They see Castile as distant, unfamiliar, and frankly somewhat barbarous compared to the sophisticated courts of Italy. Why send their carefully educated daughter to the far end of the Mediterranean when she could marry into Milan, Venice, or one of the great Italian houses? They would need significant persuading.\n\n\nPope Eugenius IV's Disposition: 26 — Pope Neutral.\n\n\nThis is a private family matter. The Pope has no particular interest in Gonzaga marriage arrangements.\n\n\nSummary: A 12-year-old from the cultured Gonzaga court of Mantua—plain in appearance but extraordinarily well-educated, one of the most learned young women in Europe thanks to Vittorino da Feltre's humanist school. She is personally healthy and content in temperament. However, her family's fertility history is deeply concerning—the Gonzaga bloodline struggles to produce children. Her family is reluctant to consider a Castilian match, seeing Iberia as distant and uncultured. She could be a brilliant intellectual companion, but producing heirs may prove difficult or impossible.\n\n\n\nCandidate 2 — Este of Ferrara, Age 23\n\n\nFamily: The Este family has ruled Ferrara since 1264—one of the oldest and most established dynasties in Italy. They are legendary patrons of the arts; their court rivals any in Europe for sophistication. The current Marquess, Niccolò III d'Este, is infamous for his many mistresses and illegitimate children (he has acknowledged over 20 bastards), but the legitimate Este line is carefully maintained.\n\n\nAge: 23 — Prime childbearing age, mature and experienced in court life.\n\n\nAppearance: 96 — Legendary beauty.\n\n\nShe is stunning—the kind of woman who stops conversations when she enters a room, who inspires poets and painters, whose face men remember for the rest of their lives. In Renaissance Italy, where beauty is celebrated and immortalized in art, she is already famous. Her portrait has likely been painted by the finest artists of the age.\n\n\nTraits:\n\n\nPolitically astute (71) — Understands power, could be a valuable advisor. Growing up in the serpentine politics of the Este court has sharpened her mind. She knows how power works.\n\nImpeccable reputation (94) — Known for virtue throughout Italy. Despite her extraordinary beauty—which could easily have led to scandal—her reputation is spotless. She has navigated the dangers of being a legendary beauty in a court full of predatory men without a single whisper against her name.\n\nSharp-tongued (51) — Witty but potentially cutting. Her intelligence expresses itself in quick remarks that can charm or wound. She does not suffer fools gladly.\n\n\nFamily Political Stance: 26 — Reluctant.\n\n\nLike the Gonzaga, the Este prefer Italian matches. They are one of the great families of Italy—why look to distant Iberia? The Este have intermarried with Visconti, Gonzaga, Malatesta, and other Italian powers for generations. Castile is unknown territory. They would need convincing.\n\n\nPope Eugenius IV's Disposition: 98 — Pope Personally Involved.\n\n\nThis is remarkable. Pope Eugenius IV takes a direct interest in this match. Why?\n\n\nPossible reasons:\n\n\nThe Este have been loyal papal supporters in the complex politics of northern Italy\n\nThe Pope wishes to strengthen ties between Castile and the Italian states he can influence\n\nHe may see a Castile-Ferrara connection as useful for his own political purposes\n\nJuan's reputation as a faithful son of the Church makes this match appealing to Eugenius\n\nThe Pope may wish to do Juan a favor to cement their relationship\n\n\nWhatever the reason, Eugenius has made clear he wants this match to happen. He will offer to negotiate personally, provide dispensations, apply pressure to the reluctant Este family, and treat this as a matter of Church interest.\n\n\nSummary: A 23-year-old from the ancient Este dynasty of Ferrara—a legendary beauty with an impeccable reputation, politically astute and sharp-witted. She is everything a queen should be: beautiful, intelligent, virtuous, and sophisticated. Her family is reluctant, preferring Italian matches, but Pope Eugenius IV himself has taken personal interest in promoting this union. With papal support, the Este reluctance could be overcome. She may be the finest candidate you have encountered—but winning her will require navigating Italian pride and leaning heavily on your papal connections.\n\n\n\nItaly Summary Table\n\nCandidate\nHouse\nAge\nAppearance\nKey Traits\nFamily Stance\nPope's Disposition\n1\nGonzaga of Mantua\n12\nBelow Average\nExceptionally Educated, Robust health, Content, Fertility concerns (serious)\nReluctant\nNeutral\n2\nEste of Ferrara\n23\nLegendary Beauty\nPolitically astute, Impeccable reputation, Sharp-tongued\nReluctant\nPersonally Involved\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\nCandidate 1 (Gonzaga) offers a brilliant mind in a plain package—one of the best-educated women in Europe, healthy and content. But she is only 12, her family is reluctant, and her bloodline has serious fertility problems. Given that Isabel died in childbirth, marrying into a family with known childbearing difficulties is a significant risk.\n\n\nCandidate 2 (Este) is extraordinary—a legendary beauty with sharp political intelligence and a spotless reputation. At 23, she is ready for immediate marriage and childbearing. Her family is reluctant, but Pope Eugenius IV himself wants this match to happen and will personally intervene to make it so. The papal support transforms a difficult negotiation into a likely success.\n\n\n\nComplete Candidate Overview\n\n\nShall I compile a master summary table of all candidates from France, England, Burgundy, and Italy for comparison?"

Assessment\n\n\nÁlvaro reviews the compiled information and offers his counsel:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, having examined all possibilities, three candidates stand above the rest:\n\n\nFirst: The Este daughter of Ferrara.\n\n\nShe is, by every measure, the finest match available. Legendary beauty. Sharp political mind. Impeccable reputation. Age 23—ready for immediate marriage and children. Her family is reluctant, but Pope Eugenius himself wishes to make this match happen. His Holiness's personal involvement transforms a difficult negotiation into a near-certainty.\n\n\nThe concerns: She is Italian, not royal. Some may question whether a Marquess's daughter is sufficient for the King of Castile. And her sharp tongue suggests she will not be a passive wife—she will have opinions and voice them.\n\n\nSecond: Marie d'Alençon of France.\n\n\nPlain but healthy, educated and musical, from a desperate family that will offer excellent terms. She is a princess of the blood—Valois cadet branch—which carries real prestige. Her robust health suggests she will bear children without difficulty.\n\n\nThe concerns: She is plain. You would not look upon her with desire. But she could be a true companion—someone to talk with, to share music with, to rely upon.\n\n\nThird: The Luxembourg daughter of Burgundy.\n\n\nImperial blood—the House of Luxembourg has produced Emperors. Politically astute despite her placid exterior. Her family is eager; Duke Philip approves. At 20, she is ready for marriage.\n\n\nThe concerns: A rumored affair clouds her reputation. The truth is unknown. You would be marrying a woman touched by scandal, and the whispers would follow her to Castile.\n\n\n\n\"If you wish my honest counsel, Your Majesty: pursue the Este match.\n\n\nThe Pope's personal involvement is unprecedented. His Holiness clearly wishes to bind you closer to him and to strengthen Castile's Italian connections. With papal support, the Este reluctance will crumble. You would gain a wife who is beautiful, intelligent, virtuous, and sophisticated—a true queen.\n\n\nBut the choice is yours.\"\n\n\n\n[What would you like to do? Pursue one of these candidates?

      "say": "Álvaro considers the question carefully, stroking his chin.\n\n\n\"An excellent question, Your Majesty. Let me review each candidate's potential to bring territorial claims or succession rights.\"\n\n\n\nClaims Analysis by Candidate\n\n\nFRANCE\n\n\nValois Niece #1 & #2 (Nieces of Charles VII)\n\n\n\"The Valois nieces carry royal blood but are nieces, not daughters. Their father was likely a younger son or uncle of the current king. France follows Salic Law absolutely—women cannot inherit the throne, nor can claims pass through women.\n\n\nClaim potential: None.\n\n\nEven if you married a daughter of Charles VII himself, your children could never claim France through her. The French will not bend on this—they invented Salic Law specifically to prevent English claims through Isabella of France.\"\n\n\nMarie d'Alençon\n\n\n\"House Alençon is a cadet branch of the Valois—princes of the blood, but far from the throne. The Duke of Alençon holds his duchy, but it is not heritable through women under French law.\n\n\nClaim potential: None.\n\n\nA prestigious connection, but no territorial claims attach.\"\n\n\n\nENGLAND\n\n\nLancastrian Bastard Line\n\n\n\"This is... complicated. She descends from an illegitimate child of a Lancastrian prince, subsequently legitimized. The Beauforts—the most famous legitimized Lancastrian bastards—were explicitly barred from the succession when they were legitimized.\n\n\nHowever, legitimized lines exist in a grey area. If the main Lancastrian line were to fail entirely—if Henry VI died without issue and all his uncles' lines were extinguished—theoretically a legitimized bastard line might press a claim. It would be weak, contested, and likely lead to war rather than peaceful succession.\n\n\nClaim potential: Extremely remote and weak.\n\n\nYou would be marrying into a legal footnote, not a real succession right. England would never accept a Spanish king based on a legitimized bastard claim. This path leads to war, not inheritance.\"\n\n\nOther English Candidates (Cadet branches, Minor nobility)\n\n\nClaim potential: None.\n\n\nMinor nobility and cadet branches carry no succession rights whatsoever.\"\n\n\n\nBURGUNDY\n\n\nPhilip's Illegitimate Daughter\n\n\n\"Illegitimate children cannot inherit under any circumstances in Burgundy. Philip the Good has no legitimate children yet—when he does, they will inherit. His bastards receive lands, titles, and comfortable lives, but never the duchy.\n\n\nClaim potential: None.\"\n\n\nLuxembourg Daughter\n\n\nÁlvaro pauses here, his eyes sharpening.\n\n\n\"Now this is interesting, Your Majesty. The House of Luxembourg has produced Holy Roman Emperors—including the current Emperor Sigismund. Sigismund has no male heir. His daughter Elisabeth married Albrecht of Habsburg, who is expected to succeed him.\n\n\nBut the Luxembourg patrimony—the County of Luxembourg itself, and various other territories—does not automatically pass to the Imperial successor. There are Luxembourg family lands that might be claimed by Luxembourg heirs.\n\n\nMore importantly: if Albrecht of Habsburg dies without male issue, or if the Habsburg succession becomes contested, a Luxembourg claimant—or someone married to Luxembourg blood—might have grounds to contest for Imperial territories, or even to influence Imperial elections.\n\n\nClaim potential: Remote but real.\n\n\nNot to the Empire itself—Emperors are elected, not inherited through marriage. But to Luxembourg family territories, possibly. And to influence in Imperial succession politics, certainly. The Luxembourg name carries weight.\"\n\n\nCharolais and Cleves Daughters\n\n\n\"The Charolais are Burgundian nobles—no sovereign claims attach. The House of Cleves holds the Duchy of Cleves, but succession there follows male-preference primogeniture. A daughter married abroad would not carry the ducal claim unless all male lines failed.\n\n\nClaim potential: Cleves has a remote possibility if male lines fail. Charolais has none.\"\n\n\n\nITALY\n\n\nEste of Ferrara\n\n\n\"The Este hold Ferrara, Modena, and Reggio as Imperial fiefs. Succession has historically been flexible—illegitimate sons have inherited when legitimate lines failed. However, the Este have been careful to maintain male succession. A daughter married abroad would not normally carry claims.\n\n\nThat said... Italian politics are creative. If the male Este line were to fail, a foreign king married to an Este daughter might press a claim—especially with papal support. Pope Eugenius's personal interest in this match is notable. He may envision scenarios where Castilian influence in Ferrara serves papal interests.\n\n\nClaim potential: Remote but possible with papal backing.\n\n\nNot a strong legal claim, but Italy runs on power and papal favor more than strict law. If circumstances aligned—Este male line failure, papal support, Castilian military backing—a claim could be manufactured.\"\n\n\nGonzaga of Mantua\n\n\n\"Similar to the Este. The Gonzaga hold Mantua as an Imperial fief. Male succession is preferred. A daughter's foreign husband would have no normal claim.\n\n\nClaim potential: Very remote.\"\n\n\n\nSummary Table: Claims Potential\n\nCandidate\nHouse\nPotential Claims\nStrength\nNotes\nValois Nieces\nFrance (Royal)\nNone\nN/A\nSalic Law absolute\nMarie d'Alençon\nFrance (Princes of Blood)\nNone\nN/A\nCadet branch, Salic Law\nLancastrian Bastard\nEngland (Legitimized Royal)\nEnglish throne\nExtremely weak\nWould require main line extinction AND war\nEnglish Others\nMinor nobility\nNone\nN/A\nNo royal blood\nPhilip's Bastard\nBurgundy (Illegitimate)\nNone\nN/A\nIllegitimate\nLuxembourg\nLuxembourg/Imperial\nLuxembourg territories, Imperial influence\nRemote but real\nImperial elections are influenced by connections\nCharolais\nBurgundy (Noble)\nNone\nN/A\nNon-sovereign\nCleves\nCleves (Ducal)\nDuchy of Cleves\nVery remote\nOnly if all male lines fail\nEste of Ferrara\nEste (Princely)\nFerrara, Modena, Reggio\nRemote but possible\nRequires male line failure + papal support\nGonzaga\nGonzaga (Princely)\nMantua\nVery remote\nRequires male line failure\n\n\nÁlvaro's Assessment on Claims\n\n\n\"To speak plainly, Your Majesty: none of these marriages will win you a crown through inheritance alone.\n\n\nThe strong claims—France, England—are blocked by law or legitimacy barriers. The weaker claims—Luxembourg, Este, Cleves—require male line extinctions and favorable circumstances that may never arise.\n\n\nHowever, there is a difference between a legal claim and a useful claim.\n\n\nThe Luxembourg daughter gives you connection to the Imperial family and potential influence over Imperial politics. When Sigismund dies—and he is 65—the succession may not be smooth. Albrecht of Habsburg is the expected heir, but Habsburgs have died young before. Luxembourg blood in your household keeps options open.\n\n\nThe Este daughter gives you a foothold in Italy backed by papal favor. Pope Eugenius wants you connected to Ferrara. Why? Perhaps he envisions Castilian intervention in Italian affairs—on his behalf. A claim to Ferrara might be weak in law, but law matters less than swords and papal bulls in Italy.\n\n\nIf claims matter to you, these two candidates offer the most—not through strength of legal right, but through possibility and influence.\n\n\nBut I would counsel this: do not marry for claims alone. You need a wife who will bear healthy children. Isabel died giving you an heir. Fernando is one small life standing between Castile and succession crisis. A beautiful, healthy wife from a fertile line serves your dynasty better than a plain wife with a distant claim to a foreign duchy.\n\n\nThe Este daughter offers both: connection to Italian power and prime childbearing years with no noted fertility concerns. The Luxembourg daughter offers Imperial connection but carries scandal and is plain.\n\n\nMy recommendation remains the Este match. But I understand if claims weigh heavily in your thinking.\"\n\n\n\n[Does this analysis change your thinking? Do you wish to pursue a specific candidate, or do you have other questions?]"

His name has faded from prominence—he held no significant titles or lands of his own, being a younger son, and died before he could distinguish himself.\n\n\nMother: A noblewoman of a minor Italian house (likely from the Romagna or Emilia region), who died shortly after her husband, leaving the young Lucia an orphan.\n\n\nUpbringing: Raised at the Este court in Ferrara as a ward of her uncle Niccolò III. She grew up alongside his legitimate and illegitimate children, receiving the same education and refinements. The Marquess, despite his many flaws, has always acknowledged his duty to family. Lucia was never neglected—she was given tutors, fine clothing, and a place at court befitting her blood.\n\n\nStatus: Legitimate but without inheritance.

She is not the Marquess's own daughter—there will be no question of Castile becoming entangled in Este succession disputes. She brings the Este connection without the complications of being too close to the inheritance.\n\n\nAnd the Pope wishes to make this match happen. Eugenius IV does not involve himself personally in minor marriage negotiations.

And the path is clearer than most marriage negotiations, thanks to His Holiness's involvement.\"\n\n\nHe rises and moves to the writing desk, already organizing his thoughts.\n\n\n\nThe Strategy\n\n\n\"We have three parties to consider: the Este family, Pope Eugenius IV, and Lucia herself. Let me outline how we approach each.\n\n\nFirst: Pope Eugenius IV\n\n\nHis Holiness has already indicated he wishes this match to happen. We should write to him first—before approaching the Este directly. This accomplishes several things:\n\n\nIt shows respect for papal involvement, which Eugenius will appreciate\n\nIt allows the Pope to prepare the ground with the Este before our formal approach\n\nIt transforms our proposal from 'foreign king seeks Italian bride' to 'the Holy Father recommends this union'\n\nThe Este reluctance will melt considerably when the Pope himself endorses the match\n\n\nThe letter to Eugenius should be personal, warm, and frame the marriage as serving the Church's interests—strengthening ties between faithful Castile and the Italian states, creating a union blessed by the Holy See.\n\n\nSecond: Niccolò III d'Este, Marquess of Ferrara\n\n\nOnce the Pope has indicated his support to the Este—which he will do swiftly if he is as eager as reports suggest—we send a formal embassy to Ferrara. Not merely a letter, but an embassy: a nobleman of rank, bearing gifts, empowered to negotiate terms.\n\n\nThe embassy should carry:\n\n\nA personal letter from Your Majesty to the Marquess\n\nA letter from Your Majesty to Lucia herself (this is unusual but will be noted—it suggests you see her as a person, not merely a transaction)\n\nGifts appropriate to the Este court's sophistication\n\nFull authority to discuss dowry, dower, and marriage terms\n\n\nThird: Lucia d'Este\n\n\nThe letter to Lucia is delicate. She is not a political actor in this negotiation—her uncle will decide—but she is the woman you are asking to leave her homeland forever and become Queen of Castile. A personal letter, expressing genuine regard and something of yourself, could make the difference between a bride who comes willingly and one who comes reluctantly.\n\n\nYou have done this before, Your Majesty. Isabel came to you uncertain and afraid, and you won her heart. The same qualities that won Isabel—your sincerity, your faith, your willingness to see the woman rather than just the queen—could serve you again.\"\n\n\n\nThe Letters\n\n\nÁlvaro pulls fresh parchment toward him.\n\n\n\"With your permission, I will draft the formal diplomatic correspondence—the terms, the protocols, the proper addresses. But certain letters should come from your own hand, in your own words.\n\n\nI suggest the following:\n\n\nLetter 1: To Pope Eugenius IV (Your hand)\n\n\nThank him for his continued spiritual guidance\n\nExpress your desire to remarry for the good of Castile and the succession\n\nMention that you have heard of Lucia d'Este and her virtues\n\nAsk for his blessing and, if he is willing, his assistance in approaching the Este family\n\nFrame this as seeking his counsel, not demanding his intervention\n\n\nLetter 2: To Niccolò III d'Este, Marquess of Ferrara (Formal, drafted by me, signed by you)\n\n\nFormal proposal of marriage alliance between Castile and Este\n\nPraise for the Este family's ancient lineage and reputation\n\nSpecific mention of Lucia's renowned virtues\n\nIndication that Pope Eugenius has blessed this approach\n\nRequest to send an embassy to discuss terms\n\n\nLetter 3: To Lucia d'Este (Your hand)\n\n\nPersonal, not political\n\nSomething of who you are—your faith, your losses, your hopes\n\nAcknowledgment that you are asking much of her\n\nPerhaps mention of Isabel, briefly—that you know what it is to love and to lose\n\nAn invitation to correspondence, if she wishes\n\n\n\nThe Gifts\n\n\n\"The Este court is one of the most sophisticated in Italy. They are patrons of art, music, literature. Crude displays of wealth will not impress them—they have wealth. What will impress them is taste.\n\n\nI suggest:\n\n\nFor Marquess Niccolò III:\n\n\nA fine Castilian warhorse—the Este appreciate horsemanship\n\nA piece of Moorish craftsmanship from Granada—something they cannot obtain elsewhere, demonstrating your unique access to Islamic artistry\n\nPerhaps a illuminated manuscript or rare book, if we have something suitable\n\n\nFor Lucia:\n\n\nGranada silk—the finest we have, in colors that would suit a legendary beauty\n\nA piece of jewelry that shows craftsmanship rather than mere expense\n\nPerhaps something personal—a book of poetry, or a devotional work, that suggests you have thought about her rather than simply sending treasure\n\n\nFor the Este Court Generally:\n\n\nSamples of Castilian goods—wines, leatherwork, Toledo steel\n\nSomething that demonstrates Castile's sophistication, countering any Italian assumptions about Iberian 'barbarism'\"\n\n\n\nThe Embassy\n\n\n\"For the embassy itself, we need a nobleman of sufficient rank to honor the Este, with the diplomatic skill to navigate Italian courts.\n\n\nI would suggest Don Íñigo López de Mendoza—head of House Mendoza, sophisticated, educated, a poet himself. The Italians would respect him. And his involvement signals that the greatest houses of Castile support this match.\n\n\nAlternatively, if you wish Don Íñigo to remain in Castile, we could send a senior churchman—perhaps the Bishop of Burgos, or another prelate who could coordinate with papal representatives in Italy.\n\n\nThe embassy should depart as soon as the Pope's response arrives, so we are ready to move the moment Eugenius signals his support.\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down his pen and looks at you.\n\n\n\"Shall I begin the preparations, Your Majesty? And will you write the personal letters yourself—to the Pope and to Lucia?\"\n\n\n\n[How do you wish to proceed? Will you write the letters yourself, or would you like me to draft them for your review?]"

      "say": "Álvaro nods slowly, his eyes brightening at the efficiency of the plan.\n\n\n\"A single delegation that accomplishes both purposes in sequence. Yes—this is sound, Your Majesty. It saves months of back-and-forth correspondence and demonstrates decisiveness. The Italians respect boldness.\"\n\n\nHe begins making notes.\n\n\n\nThe Combined Delegation\n\n\n\"The delegation travels first to Rome, presents your letter to Pope Eugenius, receives his blessing and any letters of introduction he wishes to provide, and then continues north to Ferrara with full papal endorsement in hand. By the time they arrive at the Este court, the ground will already be prepared.\n\n\nThis approach has several advantages:\n\n\nSpeed: Rather than write to Rome, await reply, then send to Ferrara, we compress the timeline significantly. If the delegation departs within the week, they could be in Rome within three weeks, in Ferrara a week after that. We could have preliminary terms agreed before winter.\n\n\nMomentum: The Este will have little time to deliberate, seek other offers, or raise objections. The delegation arrives with papal blessing already secured—refusing becomes much more difficult.\n\n\nPapal Involvement: His Holiness can brief our ambassador personally on the Este family's concerns, sensitivities, and what arguments will prove most persuasive. This intelligence is invaluable.\n\n\nUnified Message: One delegation, one consistent message, rather than separate embassies that might create confusion or contradictions.\"\n\n\n\nDelegation Composition\n\n\nÁlvaro taps his pen against the desk.\n\n\n\"For a mission of this importance—negotiating a royal marriage with papal involvement—we need:\n\n\nAn Ambassador of Rank\n\n\nSomeone who can speak as your voice, negotiate terms, and command respect at both the papal court and the Este court. I would still recommend Don Íñigo López de Mendoza if he can be spared. His reputation as a poet and man of letters will resonate with the cultured Italians. He led the Council of Great Houses admirably; he can lead this.\n\n\nIf not Don Íñigo, then perhaps Don Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza—he commanded your fleet, knows Italy from naval operations, and carries the Mendoza name.\n\n\nA Senior Churchman\n\n\nTo liaise with the papal court and lend ecclesiastical weight to the negotiations. The Bishop of Burgos, or another prelate of standing. This also signals that the Castilian Church supports the match.\n\n\nA Secretary/Notary\n\n\nTo handle the legal documents, contracts, and formal correspondence. Someone fluent in Latin and Italian if possible.\n\n\nA Suitable Escort\n\n\nNot an army, but enough men to demonstrate Castilian dignity—perhaps twenty to thirty knights in good livery, plus servants. The Italians will note how our men present themselves.\n\n\nA Master of Gifts\n\n\nSomeone responsible for the gifts we discussed—ensuring they arrive intact, are presented appropriately, and make the impression we intend.\"\n\n\n\nThe Letters\n\n\n\"You will still need to write three letters, Your Majesty, but they will all travel with the same delegation:\n\n\nLetter 1: To Pope Eugenius IV\n\n\nPresented first, in Rome\n\nRequests his blessing and active support\n\nEmpowers the ambassador to receive papal guidance\n\n\nLetter 2: To Marquess Niccolò III d'Este\n\n\nCarried to Ferrara after Rome\n\nFormal proposal, mentioning papal endorsement\n\nIntroduces the ambassador and his authority to negotiate\n\n\nLetter 3: To Lucia d'Este\n\n\nPersonal letter, delivered alongside the formal proposal\n\nYour own words, your own hand\n\n\nShall I draft the formal letters for your review and signature? And will you write the personal letter to Lucia yourself?\"\n\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\"If we move swiftly:\n\n\nThis week: Finalize delegation composition, gather gifts, draft letters\n\nWithin seven days: Delegation departs Toledo\n\nThree weeks hence: Delegation arrives in Rome\n\nOne week in Rome: Audience with Pope, receive blessing and guidance\n\nOne week travel: Rome to Ferrara\n\nLate October/Early November: Delegation arrives in Ferrara, negotiations begin\n\nBefore Christmas: God willing, preliminary agreement reached\n\nSpring 1434: Wedding could take place—either Lucia travels to Castile, or you travel to Italy (perhaps combining with your planned Constantinople journey)\"\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down his pen.\n\n\n\"What are your orders, Your Majesty? Shall I summon Don Íñigo and begin preparations?\"\n\n\n\n[How do you wish to proceed? Who should lead the delegation? Will you write the letters yourself or review drafts?]"

Italian courts are accustomed to flowery praise, elaborate compliments, references to classical mythology and ancient virtue. This letter has none of that. It is direct, honest, slightly irreverent—you jest about your confessor, you speak of heaven in a way that will make her curious, you acknowledge the strangeness of the situation rather than pretending it is normal.\"\n\n\nHe taps the parchment thoughtfully.\n\n\n\"The Italians may not know what to make of it. But Lucia might. If she is truly as sharp as the reports suggest, she will recognize authenticity when she sees it. She has likely received—or heard of—dozens of suitors' letters filled with empty flattery. This... this is different.\"\n\n\nA slight smile crosses his face.\n\n\n\"The line about your confessor will make her laugh, I think. And the promise that your portrait is honest—\" he shakes his head with something approaching admiration, \"—that is clever. You are telling her you will not deceive her, even in small things. For a woman about to entrust her life to a stranger, that matters.\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro's Suggestions\n\n\n\"I have only minor suggestions, if you will hear them:\n\n\nFirst: You mention that people get 'all sorts of upset' when you speak of glimpsing heaven. This is true, but it may plant a seed of concern—she may wonder if you are prone to religious excess or controversial statements. Consider whether you wish to keep this line or soften it slightly.\n\n\nSecond: You invite her to agree to the union herself, which is admirable and unusual. But you might add a line acknowledging that you understand she is being asked to leave everything she knows—her home, her family, her language—for a distant kingdom. Showing that you understand the sacrifice you are asking of her would resonate, I think.\n\n\nThird: The closing is abrupt. 'I look forward to meeting you, Juan.' Perhaps add something warmer? Not flowery Italian praise, but... something that suggests anticipation beyond mere formality.\n\n\nThese are merely suggestions, Your Majesty. The letter is yours, and it should sound like you. If you wish to send it as written, I will ensure it travels safely with the delegation.\"\n\n\n\nThe Portrait\n\n\nÁlvaro glances up.\n\n\n\"You mention attaching a portrait. Do we have a suitable likeness prepared? If not, we should commission one immediately—the court painters can work quickly if pressed. It should show you as you are: young, vigorous, a king and a warrior, but also... human. Not an icon, but a man.\n\n\nShall I summon the painter?\"\n\n\n\n[Do you wish to revise the letter based on Álvaro's suggestions? And shall we arrange for a portrait to be painted?]"

You are offering her a family.\"\n\n\nHe sets the letter down with evident satisfaction.\n\n\n\"A woman of intelligence will read this and see a man who thinks of others—his daughter's need for a mother, his future wife's displacement from her homeland. The Italians expect Spanish kings to be proud and demanding. This letter suggests something different. It may intrigue her greatly.\"\n\n\n\nThe Portrait\n\n\nThe court painter, Maestro Gonzalo de Ávila, is summoned within the hour. He is a thin, nervous man with paint-stained fingers and sharp eyes that miss nothing.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty wishes a portrait for... diplomatic purposes?\" He studies Juan's face with professional assessment. \"How do you wish to be presented?

They will make an impression without appearing threatening.\n\n\nThe gifts are gathered:\n\n\nFor Marquess Niccolò III: A magnificent Andalusian stallion, black as midnight; an intricate astrolabe of Moorish craftsmanship from Granada; a illuminated book of hours\n\nFor Lucia: Bolts of the finest Granada silk in deep blues and golds; a delicate gold necklace set with sapphires; a volume of Castilian poetry translated into Latin\n\nFor the Este court: Samples of Toledo steel blades, Castilian wines, leather goods worked in the Moorish style\n\n\n\nThe Departure\n\n\nOne week later — Early September 1433\n\n\nThe delegation gathers in the courtyard of the Alcázar at dawn. Don Íñigo sits astride his horse, resplendent in traveling clothes that somehow manage to be both practical and elegant. The Bishop of Burgos rides beside him, his ecclesiastical robes covered by a practical traveling cloak. Behind them, the thirty knights form a column, the Castilian banner catching the morning breeze.\n\n\nJuan's letters—to the Pope, to Marquess Niccolò, and to Lucia—are secured in a waterproof leather case, along with the freshly completed portrait.\n\n\nDon Íñigo bows from the saddle.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.

Not merely a sacrament but a statement to the kingdom and to Christendom that the House of Trastámara endures.\"\n\n\nHe makes a note.\n\n\n\"I would suggest the Cathedral of Toledo, with the Archbishop presiding.

João is unwell. The physicians speak of his age—he is seventy-four now, and has outlived most men by decades—but I see something in his eyes that frightens me. A weariness that was not there before. A readiness.\n\n\nHe does not complain. He never complains. He still rises each morning, still attends to matters of state, still asks after you and the children. But he moves more slowly. He forgets things—small things, names, dates. Last week he called me by his mother's name. He laughed it off, but I saw his fear.\n\n\nThe physicians say it may be months. It may be years. Only God knows. But I wanted you to hear this from me, not from some ambassador's report.\n\n\nDuarte is ready, I think. He has been preparing for this his whole life. He is steady, thoughtful, perhaps too cautious—but caution is not the worst quality in a king. He will honor the alliance with Castile. He loved Isabel too, in his way. They grew up together.\n\n\nI tell you this not to burden you—God knows you carry enough—but because you are family. Because João speaks of you often, with pride. \"The boy who finished what we started,\" he calls you. He means the Reconquista, of course. He remembers when the Moors still held Granada, when it seemed they always would. He lived to see them driven out, and he credits you.\n\n\nWhen the time comes—and I pray it is not soon—I hope you will come to Portugal for the funeral, if duties permit. It would mean much to me. And to João, if he could know.\n\n\nKiss Catalina for me. Tell her that her avó thinks of her every day. And hold Fernando close—he will never know his grandmother Isabel, but he carries her blood. Make sure he knows who she was.\n\n\nI remain, as ever, your loving mother in spirit if not in flesh,\n\n\nLeonor\n\n\nWritten at Sintra, the 28th day of August, in the year of Our Lord 1433\n\n\n\nThe letter sits in your hands, the ink slightly faded from its journey.

Given the timing of your letter to Queen Leonor, we should set a date that allows her time to travel—assuming King João's condition permits her to leave Portugal.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro consults a calendar.\n\n\n\"Today is early September. If we set the baptism for mid-October—say, the fifteenth—that gives Queen Leonor approximately six weeks to receive your letter, make arrangements, and travel to Toledo. It also allows time for Don Íñigo's delegation to potentially send word from Rome, so we might share news of the marriage negotiations at the baptism itself.\"\n\n\nHe taps the calendar thoughtfully.\n\n\n\"Alternatively, we could set it for late October or even early November to provide more certainty—but delaying too long may invite questions about why the heir to Castile remains unbaptized months after his birth.\"\n\n\n\nGodparents\n\n\n\"The question of godparents remains, Your Majesty. For a prince who will one day be king, this choice carries weight. The godparents become spiritual guardians of the child and, by tradition, allies to the crown bound by sacred obligation.\"\n\n\nHe produces a short list.\n\n\n\"For Godfather, I would suggest one of the following:\n\n\nKing João I of Portugal — If his health permits, this would be a profound honor and would cement the Portuguese alliance. However, his condition makes this uncertain.\n\nPrince Duarte of Portugal — The heir to Portugal. If João cannot attend, Duarte standing as godfather binds the next generation of Portuguese royalty to Fernando. Practical and forward-thinking.\n\nKing Alfonso V of Aragón — Your ally, your brother-in-law through your sister María. This would reinforce the Aragonese alliance and the vision of Iberian unity you discussed at Granada.\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza — Head of the greatest noble house in Castile. If you wish to honor a Castilian subject rather than foreign royalty, he is the obvious choice. However, he is currently en route to Rome.\n\nEmperor Sigismund — Bold, perhaps audacious. Sigismund is elderly and far away, and would likely send a representative rather than attend himself. But having the Holy Roman Emperor as godfather to your heir would be a powerful statement about Castile's place in Christendom.\n\n\nFor Godmother, options include:\n\n\nQueen Leonor of Portugal — Fernando's grandmother, Isabel's mother. An obvious and emotionally resonant choice. She has already expressed her love for the children.\n\nQueen María of Aragón — Your sister, Alfonso V's wife. This would honor the Aragonese connection.\n\nA senior Castilian noblewoman — Perhaps the wife of Don Íñigo, or another great lady of the realm. This would honor the Castilian nobility.\n\nA representative of the Church — Unusual, but given your relationship with Pope Eugenius IV, you might ask him to designate a representative. An abbess of a prestigious convent, perhaps.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down his pen.\n\n\n\"What are your thoughts, Your Majesty?

Alfonso becomes spiritual father to your heir—a bond that transcends treaties and survives changes in political circumstance.\"\n\n\nHe makes a note.\n\n\n\"It also reinforces the succession discussions you held at Granada. Should anything happen to you—God forbid—Alfonso as godfather would have both moral authority and sacred obligation to protect Fernando's inheritance. The nobles of Castile would find it much harder to set aside an heir whose godfather is the King of Aragón.\"\n\n\nA slight pause.\n\n\n\"And, if I may speak plainly: it binds Alfonso to Fernando's interests, not merely to yours.

The war for Naples continues, and Alfonso may be unable to leave his armies. In that case, he would likely send a high-ranking proxy—perhaps Don Bernat de Centelles, his ambassador, or another trusted nobleman empowered to stand in his place. This is not unusual for royal godparents; Emperor Sigismund, for instance, rarely attends baptisms in person but sends representatives bearing his authority.\"\n\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\n\"Shall I draft the invitation to emphasize your hope for his personal attendance, while graciously allowing for a proxy if necessity demands?\"\n\n\n\nThe Godmother\n\n\n\"And for godmother, Your Majesty?

The Masters of the Military Orders, the heads of the major noble houses, the senior clergy—all will receive summons.\n\n\nTo the Castilian Delegation at Basel — Fray Hernando and the bishops should know of this event, even if distance prevents attendance. It reinforces that the succession is secured.\"\n\n\n\nThe Ceremony Plans\n\n\n\"The Archbishop of Toledo will preside, of course. The Cathedral of Toledo is the appropriate venue—the primatial see of Castile, where kings have been crowned and blessed for centuries.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro begins outlining the ceremony.\n\n\n\"The baptism itself follows standard rite, but for a prince there are additional elements:\n\n\nThe Procession — Fernando will be carried from the Alcázar to the Cathedral through the streets of Toledo, allowing the people to see their future king. The godparents—or their representatives—will walk beside the infant. Knights of the Military Orders will provide escort.\n\n\nThe Ceremony — The Archbishop will perform the sacrament. Alfonso and Leonor—or their proxies—will hold Fernando and speak the baptismal vows on his behalf. Holy water from the Jordan River, if we have any remaining in the cathedral treasury, would be a meaningful touch.\n\n\nThe Naming — Fernando will be formally proclaimed Fernando, Prince of Asturias, heir apparent to the throne of Castile. This is the moment that matters legally—his place in the succession confirmed before God and the realm.\n\n\nThe Feast — Afterward, a great celebration in the Alcázar. Music, food, wine—a chance for the court to rejoice after months of mourning. It signals that Castile looks forward, not back.\n\n\nAlms and Pardons — Traditional for royal baptisms. You might release certain prisoners, forgive certain debts, distribute charity to the poor. This spreads the blessing of the occasion throughout the kingdom.\"\n\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\n\"Is there anything you wish to add or change, Your Majesty? Any particular elements you want emphasized—or avoided?\"\n\n\n\n[Any modifications to the baptism plans? Or shall we proceed with preparations and advance time toward the ceremony?]"

      "say": "Álvaro considers the question, drawing on his knowledge of royal traditions and popular expectations.\n\n\n\"There are several traditional gestures for royal baptisms, Your Majesty. The scale and nature of the charity sends a message about what kind of king you wish to be seen as.\"\n\n\n\nTraditional Options\n\n\nBread Distribution\n\n\n\"The most common gesture—and the one the common people expect. Loaves of bread distributed at the cathedral doors, at the city gates, and in the main plazas of Toledo. For a royal baptism, we might distribute thousands of loaves. The symbolism is clear: the king feeds his people, the heir's birth brings abundance.\"\n\n\nCost: Modest. Impact: Expected, appreciated but not remarkable.\n\n\n\nCoin Scattering\n\n\n\"Also traditional. Small coins—maravedís or blancas—thrown to the crowds along the processional route, or distributed by royal almoners at designated points. The people scramble for them; it creates excitement and a sense of bounty. Some kings have scattered silver coins for especially important occasions.\"\n\n\nCost: Moderate to significant depending on quantity and denomination. Impact: Popular, creates festive atmosphere.\n\n\n\nDebt Forgiveness\n\n\n\"More substantial. You could decree that certain categories of debt owed to the crown are forgiven—back taxes for the poorest households, for instance, or fines for minor offenses. This would not affect debts between private parties, only what is owed to the royal treasury. It demonstrates mercy and eases genuine burdens.\"\n\n\nCost: Loss of revenue, but often these debts are uncollectable anyway. Impact: Significant for those affected, demonstrates justice.\n\n\n\nPrisoner Release\n\n\n\"Traditional for great celebrations. You would pardon certain categories of prisoners—those held for minor crimes, debtors, perhaps those who have served most of their sentences. Not murderers or traitors, but those whose offenses were small and whose families suffer from their absence. The Church encourages this as an act of Christian mercy.\"\n\n\nCost: None. Impact: Meaningful to the families involved, demonstrates royal mercy.\n\n\n\nDowry Funds for Poor Maidens\n\n\n\"A particularly pious gesture. You would establish a fund—or make a single large grant—to provide dowries for poor girls who otherwise could not marry respectably. This is considered highly virtuous, protecting young women from lives of poverty or sin. Queen Isabel...\" Álvaro pauses, \"...Queen Isabel favored this form of charity.\"\n\n\nCost: Moderate. Impact: Highly regarded by the Church and by families with daughters.\n\n\n\nFounding or Endowing a Charitable Institution\n\n\n\"The most lasting gesture. You could establish an orphanage, a hospital for the poor, or an almshouse in Fernando's name. The Hospital del Príncipe Fernando, perhaps, or an orphanage dedicated to his patron saint. This would serve the poor for generations and keep Fernando's baptism in living memory.\"\n\n\nCost: Significant initial investment plus ongoing support. Impact: Permanent legacy, highly prestigious.\n\n\n\nÁlvaro's Suggestion\n\n\n\"If you wish to make it special, Your Majesty—something beyond the expected—I would suggest a combination:\n\n\nThe expected: Bread and coin distribution along the processional route. The people anticipate this; to omit it would seem miserly.\n\n\nThe meaningful: Debt forgiveness for the poorest households and release of prisoners held for minor offenses. This demonstrates that Fernando's birth brings mercy to the realm.\n\n\nThe lasting: Endow a charitable institution in Fernando's name. Given that he lost his mother at birth, an orphanage would be particularly resonant—the prince who never knew his mother providing for children who have lost their parents. You might call it the Casa de la Reina Isabel in her memory, or the Hospital del Príncipe Fernando in his honor.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"This combination covers all aspects: immediate celebration for the crowds, tangible relief for the burdened, and a permanent legacy that connects Fernando's name to Christian charity for generations to come.\"\n\n\n\n[What combination would you like to pursue? Or do you have another idea entirely?]"

      "say": "Álvaro's expression softens at your choice. He understands why this resonates—Isabel came to you uncertain of her worth, and you showed her she was seen. Now you would do the same for the poorest women of your kingdom.\n\n\n\"A worthy choice, Your Majesty. And one that will be remembered. The Church will praise it, the common people will bless you for it, and...\" he pauses, \"...it honors Isabel's memory in a way she would have appreciated.\"\n\n\nHe pulls out a fresh sheet of parchment and begins calculating.\n\n\n\nThe Economics of Dowries\n\n\n\"Let me explain the landscape, Your Majesty.\n\n\nFor a peasant girl or urban poor:\nA minimal dowry sufficient to attract a laborer, craftsman's apprentice, or small farmer might be 500 to 1,000 maravedís (roughly 2-4 florins). This provides basic household goods—linens, cookware, perhaps a small sum for the husband to establish himself.\n\n\nFor a respectable artisan match:\nA dowry of 2,000 to 5,000 maravedís (8-20 florins) would allow a poor but respectable girl to marry a journeyman craftsman, a prosperous farmer, or a minor merchant. This is the level most charitable funds target—enough to secure a decent life.\n\n\nFor minor gentry or impoverished nobility:\nFallen noble families or minor hidalgos with daughters but no fortune might need 10,000 to 25,000 maravedís (40-100 florins) to make a respectable match within their station. This is rarer for charitable funds but not unheard of.\n\n\n\nFund Structures\n\n\n\"There are two approaches to establishing such a fund:\n\n\nA Single Grand Gesture:\nYou donate a large sum once—say, 10,000 florins—which is distributed over time. At 15 florins per dowry (a generous amount for common girls), this provides for approximately 650-700 maidens. However, once spent, the fund is exhausted.\n\n\nAn Endowed Fund (Perpetual):\nYou establish a principal that is invested—typically in land rents, loans to merchants, or other income-generating assets. The principal is never touched; only the annual income is distributed as dowries.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n5,000 florins principal, invested at typical returns of 5-8%, generates 250-400 florins annually\n\nAt 15 florins per dowry, this provides for 16-26 maidens every year, in perpetuity\n\n10,000 florins principal generates 500-800 florins annually\n\nThis provides for 33-53 maidens every year, forever\n\n25,000 florins principal generates 1,250-2,000 florins annually\n\nThis provides for 83-133 maidens every year, forever\n\n\nThe perpetual fund is more expensive initially but continues giving long after you are gone. Your great-grandchildren would still be providing dowries in Fernando's name.\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro's Recommendation\n\n\n\"Given the significance of the occasion—the baptism of your heir, the first great celebration since Isabel's death—I would suggest an endowed perpetual fund of meaningful size.\n\n\nA fund of 10,000 florins would be substantial without straining the treasury. It would provide for 30-50 poor maidens every year, forever. Over a century, that is three to five thousand women saved from poverty or worse—all in Fernando's name, all remembering that the Prince of Asturias gave them a future.\n\n\nIf you wished to make an even grander statement, 25,000 florins would triple the impact and establish one of the largest such funds in Christendom. But this is a significant sum—nearly 8% of your projected annual treasury.\n\n\nFor comparison:\n\n\nThe crusade cost approximately 180,000 florins per year at its height\n\nThe crown's projected treasury surplus is roughly 300,000 florins\n\nDon Íñigo's entire annual income is perhaps 15,000-20,000 florins\n\n\nA 10,000 florin fund is generous. A 25,000 florin fund is extraordinary. Either would be remembered.\"\n\n\nHe sets down his pen.\n\n\n\"What scale did you have in mind, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\n\n[How large a fund do you wish to establish?]"

Every year, Your Majesty. Long after you and I are dust, young women who would otherwise face lives of destitution or sin will walk to the altar with dignity, because of what you do today. Their children will pray for Fernando's soul. Their grandchildren will tell stories of the prince whose baptism gave their family a future.\"\n\n\nHe turns back.\n\n\n\"Isabel would have wept with joy.\"\n\n\n\nEstablishing the Fund\n\n\n\"With your permission, I will work with the Bishop of Burgos's office—or rather, his vicar, since the Bishop himself rides with Don Íñigo—to establish the legal structure. We will need:\n\n\nA Name:\nThe fund requires a formal title for legal documents and public memory. I suggest one of the following:\n\n\nLa Dote de la Reina Isabel — The Dowry of Queen Isabel. This explicitly honors her memory and connects the charity to her legacy.\n\nEl Fondo del Príncipe Fernando — The Fund of Prince Fernando. This ties the charity to the baptism and to your heir.\n\nLa Dote de Nuestra Señora de Toledo — The Dowry of Our Lady of Toledo. This gives it religious patronage, placing it under the Virgin's protection.\n\nLa Obra Pía de San Fernando — The Pious Work of Saint Ferdinand. This invokes Fernando's patron saint, the great crusader king Ferdinand III.\n\n\nAdministration:\nThe fund will need trustees to manage the principal, collect returns, and distribute dowries. Typically this would be a combination of:\n\n\nA senior churchman (ensures moral oversight and Church approval)\n\nA royal official (ensures crown supervision)\n\nPerhaps a representative of the city of Toledo (ensures local accountability)\n\n\nSelection of Recipients:\nWe must establish criteria for which maidens receive dowries. Typically:\n\n\nOrphans given priority\n\nGirls of legitimate birth but proven poverty\n\nGood moral character (attested by parish priest)\n\nAge of marriage (typically 14-20)\n\nPreference for Toledo and surrounding regions, or open to all Castile?\n\n\nDistribution Schedule:\nMost funds distribute annually, often on a significant date—the saint's day of the patron, the anniversary of the founding, or a major feast. For this fund, we might distribute on:\n\n\nFernando's birthday (August 3rd)\n\nIsabel's death anniversary (also August 3rd—the same day, a bittersweet coincidence)\n\nThe Feast of the Assumption (August 15th)\n\nThe date of the baptism itself\n\n\n\nPublic Announcement\n\n\n\"The fund should be announced at the baptism itself, Your Majesty. After Fernando is christened and proclaimed Prince of Asturias, you would address the congregation and declare the establishment of the endowment. The Archbishop would bless it. The people would witness their king honoring his dead wife by protecting the daughters of the poor.\n\n\nI will have the documents prepared for your seal before the ceremony. The announcement can be made in the cathedral, and criers will spread the news throughout Toledo and beyond.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro permits himself a rare smile.\n\n\n\"The poets will write of this, Your Majesty. The chronicles will record it. And a hundred years from now, when men speak of Juan II, they will say: He was the king who conquered Granada, and the king who gave dowries to the poor in his dead wife's name.\"\n\n\nHe picks up his pen again.\n\n\n\"What shall we call the fund? And shall the recipients be drawn from all Castile, or focused on Toledo and the surrounding lands?\"\n\n\n\n[What name do you choose, and what scope for recipients?]"
