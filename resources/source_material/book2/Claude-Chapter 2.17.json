It's March 1st, 1434. Let me search for relevant context about where we are in the story and the status of these preparations.\n\nI need to:\n1. Search project knowledge for the current state of the Constantinople expedition preparations\n2. Check the character database for current locations and status\n3. Determine where Juan is (he was in Barcelona visiting María based on the memory)\n\nLet me start by searching for relevant information.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Reconciling timeline discrepancies between chapters.\n\nThis is very helpful. Let me gather more specific information about where we are in the story and the current status. From Chapter 2.16 Summary, I can see:\n\n1. The 700 knights are ready to sail March 5\n2. Juan was in Barcelona visiting María\n3. There was a camp crisis with food and supplies that Juan helped resolve\n4. Commander Mendoza (Calatrava) is the overall commander\n5. Some knights were sick and hospitalized\n\nLet me check the character database to get more details about the current state of things.\n\n\nTool: read_text_file\n\n\nThought process: Reconciled outdated records with current timeline and preparations.\n\nThis character database seems to be outdated - it's from around April 1433 and mentions Juan heading to Rome, but based on the chapter summaries I found, we're now at Chapter 2.16 which takes place in January-March 1434 in Barcelona. The most recent chapter summary mentions:\n\n1. The 700 knights are ready to sail March 5\n2. Commander Mendoza (Calatrava) is overall commander\n3. Some knights were sick and in hospital\n4. Juan was in Barcelona visiting his sister María\n5. Juan's wife Lucia is pregnant (conceived January 1434, due October 1434)\n6. Queen Isabel has apparently died (based on the memories mentioning \"wives Isabel and later Lucia d'Este\")\n\nLet me search for more information about the current status of the 700 knights and their readiness to depart.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Synthesized military readiness assessment for knight deployment.\n\nNow I have a good picture of the situation. Let me summarize what I know:\n\n**Current situation (March 1, 1434):**\n- Juan is in Barcelona\n- The 700 knights are camped in fields outside Barcelona\n- There was a crisis with sickness (60 men in infirmary, 3 dead), spoiled food, morale issues, and command conflicts\n- Juan addressed the crisis on February 28, 1434\n- On March 1, 1434, a unified command structure was established:\n  - Overall Commander: Commander Íñigo de Mendoza (Calatrava)\n  - Quartermaster: Sergeant Tomás de Palencia (Alcántara)\n  - Second-in-Command: Commander Cervantes (Santiago)\n- Departure scheduled for March 5\n- Current status: ~640 knights fit for duty (60 recovering in hospital)\n- Supply target nearly met: 240-250 barrels of salt meat\n\nThe player is now assembling the 700 knights on March 1st to check if they're ready. This aligns with the end of Chapter 2.16.\n\nLet me narrate the scene of Juan going to inspect the knights and check on their readiness. The chapter summary indicates this is March 1, 1434, and that by this point:\n- The unified command structure was just established\n- The camp has been relocated to higher ground\n- Food and water situation improved\n- 60 knights still in hospital recovering\n- Departure planned for March 5\n\nI should show the improved conditions but also the reality of what 700 knights (or rather ~640 fit for duty) look like on the eve of departure.\n\n\n\nMarch 1, 1434\nFields outside Barcelona\n\n\nThe morning air carries the salt tang of the Mediterranean as you ride out from the city gates, Captain Fernán and a small escort of royal guards at your back. The road rises gently toward the new camp—relocated to higher ground two days ago on your orders, away from the contaminated stream that had sickened so many.\n\n\nYou crest the hill and see them spread before you.\n\n\nThe encampment has transformed since your last visit. Where three days ago you found chaos—men huddled around dying fires, the stench of poorly dug latrines, officers sniping at one another—now you see order. Tents are arranged in clean rows by Order: the black crosses of Santiago in the eastern quadrant, the red of Calatrava in the center, the green of Alcántara to the west. Cookfires burn steadily, and the smell of roasting meat drifts on the wind. Fresh water barrels stand at regular intervals, painted white so men can find them easily.\n\n\nAs you approach, a horn sounds—your standard has been spotted. Knights emerge from tents, squires scramble to form up, and within minutes the entire camp is astir.\n\n\nCommander Íñigo de Mendoza meets you at the perimeter, newly confirmed as overall commander. His grey beard is neatly trimmed, and his bearing has changed from the shame-faced man of three days ago. Behind him stand Commander Cervantes of Santiago and Sergeant-Commander Vasco de Orozco of Alcántara—the unified command structure you demanded, now presenting itself as a functioning reality.\n\n\n\"Majestad,\" Mendoza says, bowing deeply. \"We are prepared for your inspection.\"\n\n\nThe three Orders have mustered in the central clearing. You count the ranks as you ride slowly along the lines—the men standing at attention, sunlight glinting off mail and the white crusade surcoats bearing their respective Order crosses.\n\n\nRoll for Assembly Readiness: 73 — Solid Performance\n\n\nThe count is encouraging. Of the 700 knights originally assembled:\n\n\nSantiago: 282 present and fit for duty (18 still recovering in hospital)\n\nCalatrava: 241 present and fit (9 in hospital)\n\nAlcántara: 143 present and fit (7 in hospital)\n\n\nTotal: 666 knights fit and ready. The 34 still in the Hospital de la Santa Creu are expected to recover; Quartermaster Palencia has already arranged for them to follow on the first merchant convoy after the fleet departs.\n\n\nThe men look... better. Not the zealous fire of the Granada campaign, perhaps, but their backs are straight. They've been fed properly for three days. Their equipment has been repaired—you notice new straps on sword belts, fresh oil on mail. The Barcelona armorers have done their work.\n\n\nCommander Mendoza falls into step beside your horse as you complete the circuit.\n\n\n\"The supply situation, Majestad. Quartermaster Palencia reports we have secured 247 barrels of salt meat—within our minimum requirements. Fresh bread and vegetables will be loaded on March 4th. The ships' captains confirm all vessels are seaworthy. The Princesa Catalina awaits your pleasure in the harbor.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"We can sail on the fifth, as planned. Or sooner, if Your Majesty commands it.\"\n\n\nThe wind shifts, carrying the distant cry of gulls from Barcelona's harbor. Four days until departure. Constantinople waits across an uncertain sea."

They've also given me important NPC rules to follow and asked me to read the NPC guide before proceeding.\n\nLet me read the NPC guide first, then create a d100 table for how the last days before departure go.\n\n\nTool: read_text_file\n\n\nThought process\n\nThe file wasn't found at that path. Let me search for it.\n\n\nView: Looking for the NPC guide in project files\n\n\nThought process: Architected chaos table balancing expedition success and random complications.\n\nOkay, I've read the NPC guide. Now I need to create a d100 table for how the last days before departure go. This is more of a \"chaos roll\" than a persuasion roll - it's about random events and circumstances, not about Juan convincing someone of something.\n\nLet me think about what could happen in the final days before a major naval expedition departs:\n\n**Success Factors (things working in Juan's favor):**\n- Camp morale has already been restored\n- Unified command structure established\n- Supplies have been secured (247 barrels - within minimum)\n- Ships are seaworthy and ready\n- Queen María has been helpful with provisions\n- Weather is early March - transitional period in Mediterranean\n- Barcelona is a major port with good facilities\n- The knights have been fed and rested for several days\n\n**Failure Factors (potential problems):**\n- 60 knights still in hospital - any complications?\n- 34 men recovering - could there be setbacks?\n- March weather in Mediterranean can be unpredictable\n- Supply situation is at MINIMUM requirements, not comfortable surplus\n- Any last-minute equipment issues?\n- Political complications from Barcelona?\n- Ships could have issues discovered at last minute\n- Men could have second thoughts, desertions\n- Disease could return\n- Accidents during loading\n- Word from Castile that requires attention?\n- María could make last-minute demands\n- Aragonese politics could interfere\n- Something could happen to Lucia or Catalina\n- Fire in camp or ships\n- Diplomatic complications\n\nThis is a CHAOS roll, so I should include a wide range of outcomes from catastrophic to excellent. The baseline is \"things are mostly in order\" so the table should reflect what random events could derail or enhance that.\n\nLet me draft the table:\n\n\nGood. I've read the NPC guide. Now let me draft a d100 table for the final four days before departure.\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: FINAL DAYS BEFORE DEPARTURE (March 1-5, 1434)\n\n\nThis is a CHAOS ROLL — testing what random events, weather, logistics, and circumstances arise during final preparations.\n\n\nBaseline Context:\n\n\nCamp morale restored, unified command established\n\nSupplies at minimum requirements (247 barrels salt meat)\n\nShips seaworthy, 666 knights fit for duty\n\n34 knights in hospital expected to recover\n\nWeather is early March Mediterranean — transitional, unpredictable\n\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (persist across all outcomes):\n\n\nUnified command structure functioning\n\nBarcelona's cooperation secured\n\nQueen María actively supporting\n\nShips already inspected and cleared\n\nMen have been fed and rested for days\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (persist across all outcomes):\n\n\nSupply situation at minimum, no margin for error\n\n34 men still hospitalized — complications possible\n\nMarch Mediterranean weather is uncertain\n\nAny major setback now delays entire expedition\n\nLong voyage ahead with limited resupply options until Rome\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDisaster. Fire breaks out in the harbor — either in a warehouse or aboard one of the Genoese transports. Significant damage to supplies, possible loss of a ship. Departure delayed minimum one week.\n6-15\nSerious Setback. March storms roll in early. Experienced captains refuse to sail into a mistral. Weather delays departure 4-7 days, and some supplies spoil waiting. Men's morale wavers — weren't they promised March 5?\n16-25\nComplications. Two problems emerge: (1) Fever returns to a section of camp — 15-20 new cases, not catastrophic but worrying; (2) One of the Genoese captains demands additional payment, claiming original contract didn't cover Constantinople run. Both solvable, but consume Juan's final days in crisis management.\n26-40\nRough but Manageable. Equipment inspection reveals significant shortfalls — damaged armor, worn straps, rusted mail. Barcelona armorers can fix it, but at premium prices. Weather looks uncertain but not prohibitive. Departure on schedule, but nerves are frayed.\n41-55\nAdequate. Everything proceeds as planned. No major surprises. Weather is acceptable. Men board ships on March 5 without incident. The expedition begins competently, if not gloriously.\n56-70\nSmooth Departure. Final days go well. Fresh provisions arrive from Tarragona ahead of schedule. Weather clears. Men's spirits lift as they board — the waiting is finally over. Commander Mendoza reports all systems functioning.\n71-80\nGood Fortune. Unexpected boon: A Venetian merchant galley arrives in Barcelona, and its captain — hearing of the Constantinople expedition — offers to sell high-quality supplies at reasonable rates. The expedition departs with comfortable surplus rather than bare minimum.\n81-90\nExcellent Preparation. Everything aligns. All 34 hospitalized knights recover faster than expected — 28 are fit to sail with the fleet, only 6 must follow later. Weather is ideal for early March. Men board in high spirits, singing crusading hymns. Commanders report exceptional readiness.\n91-99\nAuspicious Beginning. On the morning of March 5, the wind shifts to blow directly toward Rome — the sailors call it la benedición. Queen María arrives at the harbor with a final gift: fresh fruit and wine for the entire fleet, purchased from her personal funds. The men take it as a sign. Morale is genuinely high for the first time since leaving Toledo.\n100\nDivine Wind. Everything that could go right does. All hospitalized knights recover and sail with the fleet. A passing Catalan merchant convoy volunteers two additional supply ships \"for the glory of Christendom.\" The weather is perfect — steady favorable winds that will cut days off the Rome voyage. As the Princesa Catalina clears the harbor, witnesses later swear they saw a shaft of sunlight break through the clouds directly onto the flagship.\n\n\nReady for roll?"

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated narrative arc around merchant arrival and journey departure.\n\nThe player rolled 76, which falls in the 71-80 range: \"Good Fortune.\"\n\nLet me narrate this outcome - a Venetian merchant galley arrives with supplies to sell, improving their situation from bare minimum to comfortable surplus.\n\nI should narrate the final days, the good fortune with the Venetian merchant, and then the departure on March 5th. I need to remember:\n1. Never write Juan's dialogue or actions\n2. Stop when NPCs ask questions or when Juan needs to make decisions\n3. Keep it relatively short since this is transitional\n4. The Venetian captain is an NPC - what does he want? He's a merchant, so profit. But also, going to Constantinople is dangerous - maybe he wants information, or safe passage, or to attach himself to a powerful convoy for protection through pirate waters?\n\nLet me think about the Venetian captain as an NPC:\n- What does he want? Profit, obviously. But also perhaps protection - a lone merchant vessel in the eastern Mediterranean is vulnerable. Traveling with a fleet of 700 knights would be much safer.\n- What won't he say? That he's desperate for protection. That his cargo might not sell well in the current market. That he's calculating how to extract maximum benefit from Juan's need.\n\nActually, the player said they're satisfied when NPCs are unhelpful. But this is a chaos roll result - the Venetian arriving IS the good fortune. The question is whether I need to roleplay a negotiation with the Venetian or just narrate the outcome.\n\nGiven that this is a chaos roll about logistics, not a persuasion encounter, I think I can narrate the outcome more directly. The \"good fortune\" is that supplies become available - the negotiation details can be summarized unless the player wants to engage.\n\nLet me write the scene - the final days, the Venetian's arrival, and then departure on March 5th. I should probably end with them setting sail, ready for the next phase of the journey.\n\n\nRoll: 76 — Good Fortune\n\n\n\nThe final days pass with unexpected grace.\n\n\nOn March 2nd, a Venetian merchant galley limps into Barcelona harbor with a cracked mast—storm damage from the Balearic passage. Her captain, one Nicolò Contarini, needs three days for repairs and finds himself with a hold full of salt cod, dried figs, and Cretan wine that he'd intended for Marseille.\n\n\nWord travels fast in port cities. By evening, Quartermaster Palencia has negotiated a bulk purchase: the Venetian's entire surplus cargo at rates that would make a Barcelonan merchant weep. Contarini, faced with the choice of selling now or waiting weeks for his mast and risking spoilage, accepts readily enough.\n\n\nThe expedition's supplies jump from bare minimum to comfortable surplus. Three hundred barrels of salt fish join the meat stores. The Cretan wine—twenty casks of it—will do more for morale than any speech.\n\n\n\nThe weather holds. March 3rd dawns clear, the tramontana wind steady from the north—not ideal for sailing east, but not the dreaded mistral that can pin fleets in harbor for weeks. The captains confer and pronounce conditions acceptable.\n\n\nMarch 4th brings the final loading. Fresh bread from Barcelona's ovens. Barrels of fresh water. The last equipment repairs completed. Commander Mendoza reports that 28 of the 34 hospitalized knights have recovered sufficiently to sail—only six must wait for the merchant convoy.\n\n\nThat evening, the commanders gather aboard the Princesa Catalina for a final council. The mood is cautiously optimistic. They have supplies for the Rome voyage with margin to spare. They have 694 knights fit for duty. They have favorable weather forecasts from every sailor who's looked at the sky.\n\n\n\nMarch 5, 1434\nBarcelona Harbor, Dawn\n\n\nThe fleet rides at anchor in the gray pre-dawn light: the Princesa Catalina with her red-and-gold paint gleaming, three Castilian carracks in her wake, eight Genoese transports loaded with knights and horses and all the apparatus of war.\n\n\nThe harbor is crowded despite the early hour. Word has spread through Barcelona that the Castilian king sails for Constantinople, and the citizens have come to watch history depart. Fishermen pause at their nets. Merchants stand on warehouse roofs. The bells of Santa María del Mar begin to toll.\n\n\nQueen María stands on the royal quay with her household, wrapped against the morning chill. Beside her, little Catalina—bundled in so many layers she can barely move—watches the ships with enormous eyes.\n\n\nLucia waits at the gangplank of the Princesa Catalina, Fernando in her arms, the Portuguese and Italian ladies clustered behind her. The queen's chambers aboard have been prepared. The nursery secured against rough seas.\n\n\nCommander Mendoza approaches across the cobblestones, his boots ringing in the early quiet. Behind him, the last boats ferry knights from the shore camps to the waiting transports.\n\n\n\"Majestad,\" he says, stopping at a respectful distance. \"The fleet awaits your command. All vessels report ready. The tide turns within the hour.\"\n\n\nThe wind stirs the crusade banner overhead—white cloth, red cross, snapping in the morning breeze.\n\n\nMaría steps forward. Her eyes are bright, though whether from the cold or something else is hard to say.\n\n\n\"Brother,\" she says quietly. \"God keep you. And... come back.\""

She's been reconciling with Juan, finding her own identity again, beginning to ask what she wants for herself\n- She's the regent of Aragón while Alfonso fights in Naples\n- She's been healing from her loneliness and abandonment\n- She won't say: her fear that Juan won't return, her lingering questions about what she wants from life\n\nThis is a farewell scene - it should be relatively brief and poignant, then transition to the voyage. I shouldn't make María give a big emotional speech or be overly cooperative/warm. She's still finding herself.\n\n\nYou're right—Fernando remains in Toledo with Doña Beatriz. I'll correct and continue.\n\n\n\nMaría steps forward, her breath misting in the morning air. She looks at you for a long moment, this sister you've only begun to know again these past weeks.\n\n\nShe doesn't embrace you. That's not her way—not yet, perhaps not ever. But she reaches out and touches your arm, briefly, the gesture of a woman who has forgotten how to show affection and is slowly remembering.\n\n\n\"Don't die in some foreign sea,\" she says. Her voice is quiet, meant only for you. \"I've only just found my brother again. It would be... inconvenient to lose him.\"\n\n\nBehind her, her ladies wait at a respectful distance. The Bishop of Barcelona stands ready to offer a final blessing.

The toddler is waving—at the seagulls, at the crowd, at everything and nothing.\n\n\n\"Take care of them,\" María adds. Then, softer: \"Take care of yourself.\"\n\n\nShe steps back, her face composing itself into the mask of the Regent of Aragón.\n\n\n\nYou board the flagship as the bells of Barcelona toll the hour.\n\n\nCatalina shrieks with delight as you appear on deck, squirming in Lucia's arms until she's set down to toddle toward you on unsteady sea-legs. \"Papá! Boat goes NOW?\"\n\n\nLucia watches you with quiet eyes. She knows what this departure means—Rome, Naples, Constantinople. Months of uncertain seas and uncertain politics. But she says nothing, only takes your hand briefly as you reach her side.\n\n\nThe gangplank is drawn up. The anchor chains rattle and groan. Captain Sotomayor bellows orders, and sailors scramble through the rigging.\n\n\nThe Princesa Catalina begins to move.\n\n\nFrom the quay, you can see María standing motionless, one hand raised in farewell. The crowd cheers. The bells continue their toll. Barcelona slides slowly past—the Gothic spires, the crowded harbor, the city that has hosted you these long weeks.\n\n\nAnd then open water.\n\n\nThe Mediterranean stretches before you, gray-green in the morning light. Somewhere beyond that horizon lies Rome. And beyond Rome, Constantinople.\n\n\n\nVOYAGE TO ROME\nMarch 5-15, 1434\n\n\nThe crossing should take ten to fourteen days, depending on weather and winds.

Yes?\"\n\n\nShe looks up at you, and for a moment the imperious little princess is just a small girl on a very big ocean, far from everything familiar.\n\n\nThe deck rises and falls beneath you. A sailor calls out overhead, adjusting the rigging. The Princesa Catalina sails on, carrying her namesake toward Rome.\n\n\n\"Papá stays close,\" Catalina says. It's not quite a question, not quite a command. Somewhere in between."

She's described as brilliant, commanding, beautiful, with an angel's voice - but also notably indifferent to faith (a detail that's been established but not yet revealed to Juan in full). She's imperious and confident.\n\nI should write her response naturally - a toddler processing a serious warning from a parent. She might be a bit dismissive (she's Catalina, she doesn't fall), or she might show a moment of genuine understanding. Let me write something authentic to her character.\n\n\nCatalina looks down at the churning water below the bow. The sea is dark here, deep Mediterranean blue-black, and the white foam where the hull cuts through looks almost alive. The cold spray has already reddened her cheeks.\n\n\nShe studies the water for a long moment with that unsettling focus she sometimes has—the look of a child thinking thoughts too large for her years.\n\n\n\"Water is angry,\" she observes. Not frightened. Assessing.\n\n\nThen she looks back up at you, and her small jaw sets in a way that reminds you, suddenly and painfully, of Isabel.

A sudden mistral catches the fleet in open water between the Balearics and Sardinia. One Genoese transport founders—loss of 50-60 knights, horses, and supplies. Another transport badly damaged, must limp to Cagliari for repairs. Fleet scattered, takes days to reform. Arrival in Rome delayed by 2-3 weeks. Morale shattered.\n6-10\nSevere Storm. Three days of heavy weather forces the fleet to shelter in the Balearics. No ships lost, but significant damage to rigging and stores. Twelve horses die from stress and injuries. Dozens of knights injured, several seriously. Arrival delayed 10-12 days. Men arrive exhausted and demoralized.\n11-20\nIllness Spreads. Calm seas but something spreads through the close quarters—flux, fever, or simply violent seasickness that won't abate. By journey's end, 200+ knights are incapacitated, a dozen dead. The army that arrives in Rome is weakened and sick. Voyage takes 14 days.\n21-30\nContrary Winds. The winds refuse to cooperate—blowing from the east, forcing constant tacking, or dying entirely for days of frustrating calm. What should take 10 days takes 18. Supplies hold but tempers fray. Knights grumble. Some horses must be put down. Arrival in Rome is inglorious, the men sullen and tired.\n31-40\nMinor Troubles. The usual difficulties of sea travel—one transport falls behind with rigging damage, requiring the fleet to slow. Seasickness is widespread among the knights. Three horses lost. A small fire in a galley, quickly contained. Nothing catastrophic, but nothing easy. Voyage takes 14-15 days. Men arrive functional but worn.\n41-55\nAdequate Passage. The Mediterranean shows neither her best face nor her worst. Variable winds, a day of rough weather that passes, the ordinary miseries of shipboard life. Two horses lost. Widespread seasickness among landlubber knights, but they recover. Voyage takes 12-13 days. The army arrives in decent condition.\n56-70\nGood Sailing. Favorable winds for most of the journey. One brief storm, weathered without incident. Seasickness afflicts perhaps a third of the knights but passes by mid-voyage. All ships stay together. Voyage takes 11 days. Men arrive in good spirits, eager for land.\n71-80\nSwift Passage. The winds favor you—steady from the northwest, pushing the fleet toward Italy at excellent speed. Clear skies, moderate seas. Seasickness minimal. No horses lost. Voyage takes only 9 days. Knights arrive rested and ready. Commanders impressed by the smooth crossing.\n81-90\nExcellent Voyage. Everything aligns. Perfect spring weather, steady favorable winds, calm seas. The knights—many experiencing their first sea voyage—are amazed at how pleasant it is. Shipboard drills keep men sharp. Horses arrive healthy. Voyage takes 8 days. The fleet arrives in formation, flags flying, looking every inch the crusading army.\n91-99\nBlessed Crossing. Sailors speak of it for years afterward. The winds blow as if ordered, steady and true. Not a single day of rough weather. The fleet makes the crossing in 7 days—remarkable speed for such a large formation. A pod of dolphins escorts the Princesa Catalina for half a day, which the men take as a sign of divine favor. Morale soars.\n100\nThe Hand of God. A voyage that passes into legend. Six days, Barcelona to Ostia, with winds that never falter and seas like glass. No sickness. No losses. The fleet arrives in perfect formation just as the sun rises over Rome, the crusade banners catching the first light. Romans who witness the arrival speak of it as an omen.

The sea, glass-smooth yesterday, now heaves in great gray swells streaked with white foam. The wind hits you like a physical blow, cold and vicious, tearing at your cloak.\n\n\n\"Mistral!\" a sailor screams somewhere above you. \"Mistral coming!\"\n\n\nCaptain Sotomayor is already at the helm, his face grim, shouting orders that the wind shreds into fragments.

Men in the water, arms flailing, their screams inaudible over the storm.\n\n\nAnother transport, the San Giovanni, is turning—trying to rescue survivors, her captain either brave or foolish. But the maneuver brings her broadside to the wind, and you see her heel dangerously, waves breaking over her deck.\n\n\nCommander Mendoza appears beside you, drenched, gripping the rail with white knuckles.\n\n\n\"Majesty! Below decks! You must—\"\n\n\n\"How many men on that ship?\" you demand.\n\n\n\"The Santa Lucia? Sixty knights. Crew of twenty. Horses—\"\n\n\nSixty knights. Your men. Drowning in black water while you watch.\n\n\nThe San Giovanni is still attempting rescue, and she's taking on water. Another transport, the Madonna del Mare, has lost her foremast and is drifting. The fleet is scattering, each ship fighting for its own survival.\n\n\nCaptain Sotomayor grabs your arm.\n\n\n\"Majesty, I need orders! Do we heave to and try to hold position? Do we run before the wind toward Sardinia? If we stay here trying to rescue—\" He doesn't finish. He doesn't need to.\n\n\nThe storm screams. The San Giovanni is sinking lower. Men are dying in the water. And your family is below decks on a ship that could be next.\n\n\nWhat do you do?"

The captain is an experienced sailor of 30 years. He knows what's possible and what isn't in a mistral.\n\nWhat does Sotomayor want? He wants to save his ship, his king, and as many of the fleet as possible. He's a professional - he'll give honest tactical assessment.\n\nWhat won't he say directly? He won't say \"those men are already dead\" even if he believes it. He'll frame it in terms of risk and capability.\n\nLet me think about the realistic situation:\n- Mistral winds in the Mediterranean can reach 60-80 mph\n- Waves in a full mistral can be 20-30 feet\n- A ship that's capsized or foundering - men in the water in March Mediterranean - water temperature around 13-15°C (55-59°F)\n- Survival time in that water: maybe 30-60 minutes before hypothermia sets in\n- Rescue in these conditions is nearly impossible\n- The San Giovanni is already trying and taking on water herself\n- Any rescue attempt risks more ships\n\nSotomayor needs to give Juan honest information quickly. This is life and death.\n\n\nSotomayor's face is a mask of anguish and hard calculation. Thirty years at sea have taught him what storms take and what they leave.\n\n\n\"No, Majesty!\" He has to scream over the wind. \"The Princesa Catalina is a carrack—she doesn't have the maneuverability. If we turn broadside to these swells to attempt rescue, we risk capsizing ourselves. And the men in the water—\"\n\n\nHe stops. Swallows.\n\n\n\"In water this cold, this rough—they have minutes, Majesty. Minutes. By the time we could reach them, even if we didn't founder ourselves—\"\n\n\nA wave crashes over the bow.

If she goes down too, that's another sixty men. Another eighty.\"\n\n\nHis eyes meet yours.

We save what we can save. Or we heave to here, try to hold position, and pray the storm passes before we lose more ships.\"\n\n\nHe grips your arm harder.\n\n\n\"But rescue, Majesty?

I can describe Lucia's reaction and Catalina's state, then Juan grabbing his cloak and going back up.\n\n\nBelow decks, the world is chaos contained.\n\n\nThe queen's cabin is dim, lit by a single lantern swinging wildly on its hook. Everything loose has been hurled to one side—prayer books, embroidery, a cup that rolls back and forth with each pitch of the ship. The ladies-in-waiting huddle together on the built-in bench, clinging to each other. Doña Leonor is praying aloud in Portuguese. Isabella Strozzi is weeping.\n\n\nLucia is already awake, already dressed. She has Catalina in her arms—the child pulled from her swinging bed, wrapped in blankets, her face pale and confused. At your entrance, Lucia's eyes find yours immediately.\n\n\nShe listens. She doesn't argue. She doesn't ask questions there isn't time for.\n\n\n\"Go,\" she says simply. Her voice is steady. \"We'll be here.\"\n\n\nCatalina stares at you with enormous dark eyes. She doesn't cry. She doesn't demand explanations. Perhaps she's too shocked, or perhaps some instinct tells her this is not the time. She only watches as you pull on the heavy cloak, as you turn back toward the storm.\n\n\n\"Papá—\" she starts.\n\n\nBut you're already through the door.\n\n\n\nThe deck is hell.\n\n\nThe Princesa Catalina has come about, her stern now to the wind, running before the mistral toward Sardinia. The motion has changed—no longer the sickening roll of a ship fighting the sea, but a surging, plunging rush as each wave lifts the stern and sends her careening down into the trough.\n\n\nSotomayor has lashed himself to the helm. Two sailors fight the wheel beside him, muscles straining against the force of the rudder. The signal flags have gone up—though God knows if anyone can see them through this murk.\n\n\nYou grab a rope and haul yourself to the captain's side.\n\n\n\"The San Giovanni!\" Sotomayor shouts, pointing astern.\n\n\nYou turn. Through the spray and darkness, you can just make out the transport—she's lower in the water now, waves breaking over her deck. But she's moving. Limping southeast, following the flagship's lead.\n\n\n\"She's pumping! She might make it!\"\n\n\nThe Madonna del Mare is harder to spot. Her lost foremast has left her sluggish, difficult to control. But another carrack—the Santa Cruz—has pulled alongside, and you can see ropes being thrown between them.\n\n\n\"They're taking her in tow!\" Sotomayor's voice carries something like hope. \"Madness in this sea, but if they can hold the line—\"\n\n\nA wave crashes over the stern. You're soaked instantly, the cold like a knife. The ship shudders, groans, then surges forward again.\n\n\n\"Count the ships!\" you hear yourself shout. \"How many can you see?\"\n\n\nSotomayor squints into the chaos. His lips move as he counts.\n\n\n\"Flagship. Three carracks—all accounted for. The San Giovanni, the Madonna in tow, and... four... five transports running with us.\" He pauses. \"We've lost sight of two. The Santa Lucia is gone. That's three unaccounted for.\"\n\n\nThree ships. Perhaps one sunk, two missing in the storm. A hundred and fifty men, maybe more, their fate unknown.\n\n\nThe wind howls. Sardinia is eight hours away—if the storm doesn't worsen, if the ships hold together, if God has any mercy left.\n\n\nCommander Mendoza appears, drenched, clinging to the rail.\n\n\n\"Majesty!

The men are in survival mode. The speech should help steady them but may not fully calm the panic. Let me create a table that reflects this - even good rolls won't make everything perfect because the storm is still happening.\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: RALLYING THE KNIGHTS IN THE STORM\n\n\nType: PERSUASION ROLL — How does Juan's speech land with terrified men in a pitching hold?\n\n\nContext:\n\n\nKnights are landlubbers, many on their first sea voyage\n\nThey just watched the Santa Lucia go down with 60 of their brothers\n\nHorses are panicking, kicking at stalls, a real danger to the ship\n\nThe hold is dark, loud, chaotic—men can barely stand\n\nJuan is here, in the danger with them, not hiding in his cabin\n\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (persist across all outcomes):\n\n\nJuan is present, sharing the danger—not giving orders from safety\n\nThese men followed him through Granada; they know his courage is real\n\nHe's being honest about the situation, not offering false comfort\n\nHe's giving them a task, a purpose—something to do rather than just fear\n\nHis own family is aboard; his stake is as high as theirs\n\nReligious framing is appropriate and genuine\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (persist across all outcomes):\n\n\nRaw terror operates faster than reason or loyalty\n\nMany just watched brothers drown—that image doesn't fade with words\n\nThe ship is still heaving violently; the storm doesn't care about speeches\n\nHorses are still panicking; the physical danger is immediate\n\nSome men may blame Juan for bringing them on this cursed voyage\n\nSeasickness and exhaustion have already weakened many\n\nA speech cannot stop a storm\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nPanic Holds. The words are lost in the chaos. A horse kicks through a stall at the wrong moment—a knight screams, clutching a shattered leg. The sound breaks something in the men. Some freeze. Others scramble for the ladder, desperate to reach the deck, the boats, anything. Juan's presence helps prevent complete rout, but these men are broken. The horses cannot be controlled. Some will have to be put down before they kick through the hull.\n11-20\nGrudging Compliance, No Heart. The knights hear the words. They obey—because he is the king, because there is nothing else to do. But their eyes are hollow. They go through the motions with the horses, but there's no spirit in it. Some weep openly. Others pray with the desperate fervor of men who expect to die. They function, barely. Juan has bought compliance, not courage.\n21-35\nSteadied, Not Steadfast. The speech cuts through enough of the fear to prevent collapse. Men move to the horses because their king told them to, and that's enough for now. But the terror is still there, visible in shaking hands and pale faces. They'll hold—probably—but another shock could shatter them. Prayers are frantic, not faithful.\n36-50\nGrim Determination. Juan's honesty—acknowledging the storm, the danger, the need for faith—resonates with men who are tired of being afraid. They don't become brave, but they become stubborn. Castilian pride, perhaps. They'll calm the horses because the king asked, and they'll be damned if they die crying like children. The mood is dark but functional.\n51-65\nDuty Answers. Something in the speech finds purchase. Perhaps it's Juan's presence in the danger. Perhaps it's the invocation of God. Perhaps it's simply that having a task is better than having nothing but fear. The knights move with purpose. The horses begin to calm as steady hands reach them. Prayers become rhythmic, almost calming. The hold is still hell, but it's organized hell.\n66-80\nCourage Kindles. The veterans respond first—men who remember Granada, who remember what Juan asked of them before and how he stood beside them. They begin steadying the younger knights, passing on the king's calm like a torch. The horses sense the shift and begin to settle. Someone starts a hymn—Salve Regina—and others join, voices rising against the storm's howl.\n81-90\nThe King's Example. Juan's presence transforms the hold. If the king trusts the ship, perhaps they can too. If the king is calm, perhaps God hasn't abandoned them. Knights who were weeping moments ago find themselves working side by side to secure the horses. The hymn becomes a chorus. Fear remains, but it no longer rules. These men will face whatever comes.\n91-99\nFaith in the Storm. Something breaks through—not just courage, but genuine faith. Juan's words about trust and prayer become real to men who needed to hear them. A strange peace settles over the hold even as the ship pitches. The horses calm almost unnaturally. Knights who expected to die begin to believe they might live. When they emerge from this—if they emerge—they will remember this moment for the rest of their lives.\n100\nBrothers in the Deep. The hold becomes a church. Juan's speech ignites something that transcends fear—a shared recognition that they are in God's hands together, king and knight alike. Men embrace. Confessions are made. The horses stand quiet as if they too understand. When the hymn rises, it sounds like a choir of angels in the darkness. Whatever happens now, these men will never forget that their king stood with them in the belly of the storm and made them brave.\n\n\nReady for the roll?"

The air reeks of horse sweat, vomit, and fear. Knights cling to posts, to ropes, to each other—many of them on their knees, whether from seasickness or prayer, it's impossible to tell. The horses scream in their stalls, eyes rolling white, hooves crashing against wood that was never meant to withstand this punishment.\n\n\nYour voice cuts through.\n\n\nNot all of them hear the words—the storm is too loud, the chaos too complete.

Move!\"\n\n\nCommander Cervantes. The Santiago veteran hauls himself upright, using a beam for support, and staggers toward the nearest panicking stallion. His hands find the animal's muzzle, and he begins to murmur—low, steady words lost beneath the storm but somehow audible to the beast.\n\n\nThe horse's wild eyes find his. Its thrashing slows.\n\n\nOthers see. Others follow.\n\n\nA Calatrava knight—young, tear-streaked, moments ago paralyzed with terror—watches Cervantes and then stumbles toward another stall. His hands shake, but they reach out. Another knight joins him. Then another.\n\n\n\"Non nobis, Domine,\" someone begins. The old crusader's hymn, ragged and broken at first. \"Non nobis, sed nomini tuo da gloriam...\"\n\n\nMore voices join. Not triumphant—nothing so grand. But steady. Human voices raised against the inhuman shriek of the wind, finding strength in the familiar words.\n\n\nThe horses begin to calm. Not all of them—one mare in the forward stalls is still kicking, still dangerous—but enough. Enough that the immediate threat of a hoof through the hull recedes.\n\n\nA grizzled knight with a Santiago cross on his surcoat catches your eye. His face is gray, his hands bloody from wrestling a panicked destrier, but he nods once. Recognition. Respect.\n\n\n\"Granada was worse,\" he calls out to the men around him—a lie, probably, but a useful one. \"At least here there's no bastard Moors shooting at us!\"\n\n\nA few men laugh. Broken, desperate laughter—but laughter nonetheless.\n\n\nThe hymn continues, swelling now, filling the hold:\n\n\n\"Non nobis, Domine, non nobis...\"\n\n\nThe ship heaves. The storm rages. But the hold has transformed from a pit of terror into something else—a church, almost, in the belly of a wooden beast riding the fury of God's sea.\n\n\nCommander Mendoza appears at your elbow, breathing hard.\n\n\n\"The forward mare,\" he says, pointing. \"She's going to kill someone or break through.

What happens in the desperate hours before landfall?\n\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\n\nSanta Lucia confirmed lost (60 knights, 20 crew)\n\nSan Giovanni damaged but running, riding low\n\nMadonna del Mare under tow by Santa Cruz — precarious\n\nSan Marco and Stella Maris missing — fate unknown\n\nFour hours to Cagliari if nothing changes\n\nWind steady but brutal; no sign of abating\n\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (persist across all outcomes):\n\n\nCaptain Sotomayor is experienced and competent\n\nThe flagship is well-built, handling the storm\n\nKnights below have been steadied, horses controlled\n\nThe fleet is running with the wind, not fighting it\n\nSardinia is close — shelter is within reach\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (persist across all outcomes):\n\n\nThe San Giovanni is taking on water; pumps may not keep up\n\nTowing the Madonna del Mare in these seas is near-suicidal\n\nTwo ships are missing — they may already be lost\n\nFour hours is a long time in a mistral\n\nThe storm doesn't care about prayers or courage\n\nMen are already dead; more may join them\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nThe Sea Takes More. The San Giovanni's pumps fail. She goes down within sight of Sardinia — close enough that some men make it to shore, but most don't. The Madonna del Mare's tow line snaps; the Santa Cruz cannot recover her in time. Two more ships lost. When the survivors limp into Cagliari, the expedition has lost nearly 200 men and a quarter of its strength. The missing transports are never seen again.\n6-15\nCruel Mercy. The fleet makes Cagliari, but the San Giovanni founders in the harbor approaches — so close to safety. Forty men drown in sight of land. The Madonna del Mare survives, barely. The missing transports appear two days later, battered but afloat — they fled north and sheltered in the Balearics. Total losses: ~100 knights, significant supplies and horses. The expedition is bloodied before it begins.\n16-25\nLimping to Shore. The surviving fleet reaches Cagliari. The San Giovanni beaches herself on the sand — she'll never sail again, but most of her men survive. The Madonna del Mare has to be cut loose from the tow; she drifts onto rocks but in shallow water, allowing rescue. The missing transports are unaccounted for. Losses from the Santa Lucia stand: 60 knights, 20 crew. The expedition needs days to recover, possibly weeks.\n26-40\nSurvival, Barely. The fleet staggers into Cagliari harbor as the storm finally begins to break. The San Giovanni makes it — barely — and will need extensive repairs. The Madonna del Mare survives under tow, her crew exhausted, her hull groaning. Of the missing transports, one (Stella Maris) appears the next day, having sheltered behind a headland. The San Marco is never found. Total losses: ~120 men. The expedition will be delayed at least a week.\n27-55\nHolding Together. The core of the fleet reaches Cagliari intact. The San Giovanni needs pumping constantly but makes harbor. The Madonna del Mare survives under tow. Both missing transports appear within 48 hours — scattered but alive, having found separate shelter. The Santa Lucia's loss stands as the only sinking. Total losses: 60 knights, 20 crew, one ship. Terrible, but not catastrophic. Three days to regroup before continuing.\n56-70\nThe Storm Breaks. Two hours from Cagliari, the mistral begins to weaken. The last stretch is still rough but no longer murderous. All ships in the convoy make harbor. The San Giovanni and Madonna del Mare will need repairs but are savable. One missing transport (Stella Maris) appears that evening; the other (San Marco) limps in the following morning, her mainmast jury-rigged but her crew alive. Losses limited to the Santa Lucia. The expedition can continue within days.\n71-80\nSardinian Shelter. The fleet makes Cagliari in good order. The weakening storm allows the damaged ships to stabilize; the San Giovanni's pumps hold, the Madonna del Mare's tow line holds. Both missing transports rejoin within 24 hours — they'd been driven north but found each other and made for Cagliari together. The Santa Lucia's dead are mourned, but the expedition remains viable. Repairs needed are minor. Two days to continue.\n81-90\nProvidence. The storm breaks an hour from harbor — suddenly, as mistrals sometimes do. The fleet enters Cagliari under clearing skies. Both damaged ships make it without further incident. Remarkably, all four surviving transports arrive safely, including both that were missing — the San Marco and Stella Maris had found shelter together and followed the fleet's wake. Only the Santa Lucia was lost. Grief for the dead, but the expedition is intact. Ready to sail for Rome within days.\n91-99\nMercy in the Deep. The storm dies as if God Himself snuffed it out. The fleet enters Cagliari harbor to find the San Marco already there — her captain had run ahead of the storm and made port hours earlier. The Stella Maris arrives that evening. Of the Santa Lucia, a fishing boat reports pulling eleven survivors from the water — men who clung to wreckage until the seas calmed. Sixty are still lost, but not eighty. Not all prayers go unanswered.\n100\nMiracle at Cagliari. As Juan prays at the bow, the clouds break. A shaft of sunlight — impossible, absurd — falls across the Princesa Catalina. The storm doesn't end, but it shifts, the wind swinging south, driving the fleet toward Sardinia at tremendous speed. They make Cagliari in two hours instead of four. Every ship survives. And in the harbor, they find the Stella Maris — and clinging to her hull, a boat full of Santa Lucia survivors, thirty-one men pulled from the sea by her captain's desperate rescue attempt. The dead are still dead, but God has given back what He could.\n\n\nReady for the roll?"

The San Giovanni founders in the harbor approaches - so close to safety. Forty men drown in sight of land. The Madonna del Mare survives, barely. The missing transports appear two days later, battered but afloat. Total losses: ~100 knights, significant supplies and horses.\n\nI need to narrate this tragically and realistically. Juan is at the bow praying. I should show the hours passing, the hope of reaching Cagliari, and then the cruel twist of the San Giovanni going down within sight of safety.\n\nRemember: NEVER generate dialogue or action for Juan. Stop when Juan needs to react or make a decision.\n\n\nRoll: 15 — Cruel Mercy\n\n\n\nThe hours blur into a single grey eternity of wind and water.\n\n\nYou stay at the bow until your hands are numb on the railing, until the salt spray has soaked through every layer, until you cannot feel your face. The prayer becomes a rhythm, words repeated until they lose meaning and become something purer—a raw plea hurled into the teeth of the storm.\n\n\nThe fleet runs on.\n\n\nSotomayor's voice reaches you in fragments. Three hours. Two hours. We'll make it, Majesty. Each time you turn, you count the ships behind you—dark shapes in the murk, still there, still fighting.\n\n\nThe San Giovanni is riding lower. You can see it even through the spray. Her deck is awash between waves now. But her pumps are still working, her crew still fighting, and Cagliari is close.\n\n\n\nLate Afternoon\n\n\n\"Land!\"\n\n\nThe cry goes up from the masthead. Through the storm's haze, you see it—a dark line on the horizon. Sardinia. Safety.\n\n\nThe fleet surges toward it. Men who have been silent for hours begin to shout, to weep, to pray aloud in thanks. You can see the harbor mouth now, the breakwater, the blessed shelter of Cagliari's bay.\n\n\nThe Princesa Catalina passes through first, the flagship leading her battered flock to safety. The motion changes immediately—the murderous swells dampening to something merely rough as the breakwater blocks the worst of the wind.\n\n\nYou turn to watch the others follow.\n\n\nThe three carracks come through, battered but whole. The Madonna del Mare, still under tow, limps past the breakwater with the Santa Cruz straining at her lines. Transport after transport passes into the harbor's embrace.\n\n\nAnd then the San Giovanni.\n\n\nShe's almost there. Two hundred yards from the harbor mouth. You can see her crew on deck, can see them pointing at safety, can almost hear their cheers—\n\n\nThe wave comes from nowhere.\n\n\nA rogue swell, somehow finding its way past the breakwater's protection, catches the San Giovanni broadside just as she begins her turn into the harbor. The ship—already low, already dying—rolls.\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nShe doesn't recover.\n\n\nThe San Giovanni goes over slowly, almost gently, her masts touching the water, her hull rising like a whale's back. Men spill from her deck into the churning harbor mouth. The sound reaches you a moment later—screams, splintering wood, the terrible groan of a ship dying.\n\n\n\"Boats!\" someone is screaming. \"Get the boats in the water!\"\n\n\nBut the harbor is chaos. Ships are still entering, still maneuvering. By the time the first rescue boat reaches the spot where the San Giovanni went down, the water is full of wreckage and empty of living men.\n\n\nYou watch them pull bodies from the harbor for the next hour.\n\n\nForty-three men. So close to safety they could see the fires on shore.\n\n\n\nThat Night\nCagliari Harbor\n\n\nThe Madonna del Mare survives. Barely. Her captain weeps when he steps onto the dock—whether from relief or exhaustion or grief, no one asks.\n\n\nThe missing transports do not appear.\n\n\nYou stand on the deck of the Princesa Catalina as the sun sets behind the storm clouds, still watching the harbor mouth. Waiting. Praying.\n\n\nCommander Mendoza approaches. His face is haggard.\n\n\n\"The count, Majesty.\" His voice is hoarse. \"The Santa Lucia—sixty knights, twenty crew. Gone in the open sea. The San Giovanni—fifty-eight knights, twenty-three crew. Gone in the harbor mouth.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"The San Marco and Stella Maris are still missing. If they're lost... that's another hundred and twenty men. Perhaps more.\"\n\n\nOne hundred and sixty dead, certain. Perhaps two hundred and eighty.\n\n\nThe expedition sailed from Barcelona with six hundred and ninety-four knights.\n\n\n\"The men are...\" Mendoza stops. Starts again. \"They're asking what we do now, Majesty. Do we wait for the missing ships? Do we continue to Rome? Do we...\"\n\n\nHe cannot finish.\n\n\nThe wind is dying now. The storm, having taken what it wanted, begins to fade."

The child's face is pale, tear-streaked, but peaceful now. Doña Leonor sits beside them, rosary beads still wrapped around her fingers. Donna Francesca is tending to young Isabella Strozzi, who appears to have been sick throughout the ordeal.\n\n\nThe nursemaid María kneels in the corner, praying silently.\n\n\nWhen you enter, Lucia looks up. Her face is composed—the mask of a queen, a d'Este—but her eyes betray her. She has been terrified. She has held it together for Catalina, for the ladies, for everyone, and now she is holding on by her fingernails.\n\n\nShe doesn't speak. She simply looks at you, her hand resting on your sleeping daughter's hair.\n\n\nCatalina stirs at the change in the air. Her eyes flutter open, find you, and suddenly she is reaching—\n\n\n\"Papá.\"\n\n\nHer voice is very small. Not imperious. Not demanding. Just a small girl who has been frightened for hours and hours and wants her father."

The funeral ceremony\n4. Set up the scene for Juan's address and STOP for the player to speak\n\n\nMarch 8-11, 1434\nCagliari, Sardinia\n\n\n\nThe First Day\n\n\nCagliari is a city accustomed to ships in distress. The Sardinian port has sheltered storm-battered fleets for centuries, and its people know the rhythms of maritime disaster: the counting of the living, the recovery of the dead, the grim business of salvage.\n\n\nThe Governor of Sardinia—an Aragonese appointee named Don Berenguer de Montcada—arrives at the harbor before noon. He is a practical man, grey-bearded, efficient. Within hours he has arranged billets for the knights too shaken to remain aboard ship, opened the city's stores for emergency provisions, and summoned every shipwright in the city to assess the damage.\n\n\nThe Madonna del Mare is savable—her hull is sound, but she needs a new foremast and extensive repairs to her rigging. A week's work, perhaps ten days.\n\n\nThe San Giovanni is a grave in the harbor mouth. Divers recover what bodies they can.\n\n\n\nThe Second Day\n\n\nAt dawn, a cry goes up from the harbor watch.\n\n\nSails on the horizon.\n\n\nYou're on deck within minutes, watching two battered shapes limp toward Cagliari under jury-rigged canvas. The San Marco and Stella Maris—the missing transports, given up for dead.\n\n\nTheir story emerges in fragments as exhausted captains and shattered crews stumble onto the docks. The storm had scattered them north. They'd found each other by chance in the chaos, lashed their ships together, and sheltered in the lee of a rocky Balearic islet for nearly two days. When the winds shifted, they ran south, following the coast until they found the fleet's wake.\n\n\nNot a man lost between them. One hundred and twenty knights, alive.\n\n\nThe cheering that rises from the harbor can be heard across the city.\n\n\n\nThe Accounting\n\n\nCommander Mendoza presents the final tally:\n\n\nLost at Sea (Santa Lucia):\n\n\n60 knights\n\n20 crew\n\n45 horses\n\nSignificant supplies\n\n\nLost in Harbor (San Giovanni):\n\n\n43 knights\n\n19 crew\n\n38 horses\n\n\nTotal Dead: 103 knights, 39 crew — 142 souls\n\n\nExpedition Strength Remaining:\n\n\n591 knights fit for duty\n\n34 still recovering in Barcelona (will follow on merchant vessels)\n\nFleet reduced from 12 vessels to 10 (one sunk, one wrecked)\n\n\nThe expedition has lost nearly fifteen percent of its strength before reaching Rome.\n\n\n\nMarch 10, 1434\nThe Funeral\n\n\nThe Cathedral of Santa Maria di Castello cannot hold everyone. Knights crowd the nave, spill out into the square, line the streets. The Bishop of Cagliari—hastily summoned—presides over a Mass for the dead that lasts three hours.\n\n\nOne hundred and forty-two names are read aloud.\n\n\nThe bodies recovered from the harbor—twenty-three in all—are buried in the cathedral's cemetery, in a mass grave marked with a simple stone cross. The families in Castile will receive letters. The Military Orders will record the names. But there is no way to send bodies home across so much sea.\n\n\nAfter the Mass, you stand before the grave as the earth is shoveled in. Lucia is beside you, veiled in black. Catalina, for once, is silent—she doesn't understand death, not truly, but she understands that something terrible has happened, and that Papá is sad.\n\n\nThe knights watch. They have followed you through the conquest of Granada, through sieges and battles and the long bloody work of the Reconquista. They trusted you to lead them to Constantinople.\n\n\nNow they wait to hear what you will say.\n\n\n\nThe Address\n\n\nThe square before the cathedral is packed. Nearly six hundred knights in crusader white, their Order crosses bright against the Sardinian sun. Sailors from the fleet. Citizens of Cagliari who have come to witness. The Governor and his household.\n\n\nA platform has been erected before the cathedral steps. The crusade banner—white cloth, red cross, somehow preserved through the storm—hangs limp in the still air.\n\n\nCommander Mendoza calls for silence. The crowd settles.\n\n\nSix hundred faces turn toward you."

This is a PERSUASION ROLL.\n\nLet me analyze the speech:\n\n**What Juan said:**\n- Called them to come closer, stand together\n- Acknowledged the difficulty of losing brothers not in battle but to the sea\n- Called for humility and acknowledgment that seamen saved them\n- Committed to carrying on\n- Promised to honor the fallen with future deeds\n- Called for a moment of silence\n\n**Analyzing the speech quality:**\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Honest and humble - acknowledges the tragedy without sugarcoating\n- Credits the sailors, showing he's not too proud\n- Doesn't make grandiose promises\n- Calls for unity (\"stand together\")\n- Focuses on honoring the dead through action, not just words\n- Brief and dignified - appropriate for a funeral\n- The moment of silence is a good, solemn touch\n\nWEAKNESSES:\n- Relatively short - some might want more\n- Doesn't directly address their fears about continuing\n- Doesn't explain WHY they carry on or reaffirm the mission's purpose\n- Doesn't mention God much (just a brief funeral context)\n- Doesn't acknowledge that some might be questioning the whole expedition\n- \"Tomorrow we will carry on\" is somewhat abrupt after such loss\n\n**Context factors:**\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n- Juan stayed on deck through the storm, shared the danger\n- He went below to rally the knights, calmed the horses situation\n- He prayed publicly at the bow\n- He ordered proper mourning time, didn't rush them back to sea\n- The missing ships returned - morale boost\n- The speech is appropriately humble and honest\n- He credits the sailors - shows he's not arrogant\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n- 142 men are dead - that's a heavy weight\n- Many might question if this expedition is cursed\n- Some might blame Juan for the voyage in the first place\n- The storm hit before they even reached Rome - Constantinople feels impossibly far\n\n\n- Devastating loss of manpower and morale\n- Proximity of death makes the tragedy more visceral\n- Emotional wounds are raw and immediate\n\nThe speech reveals deep emotional complexity. While Juan attempts to provide leadership and hope, the overwhelming grief and uncertainty threaten to undermine his efforts. The knights are wrestling with profound loss, questioning their mission's viability, and struggling to maintain cohesion in the face of catastrophic setbacks.\n\nThe speech needs more than procedural reassurance - it requires a compelling narrative that transforms their collective suffering into meaningful purpose. Simply stating they will continue isn't enough; he must articulate a transformative vision that transcends their current despair.\n\nThe approach requires deeper emotional resonance, connecting their immediate trauma to a larger, meaningful struggle that gives their potential sacrifice profound significance.\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: ADDRESS TO THE FLEET AT CAGLIARI\n\n\nType: PERSUASION ROLL — How does Juan's funeral speech land with men who have just buried 142 of their brothers?\n\n\nContext:\n\n\n103 knights and 39 crew dead — 15% of expedition strength\n\nMen watched brothers drown in sight of safety\n\nTwo ships returned from presumed death — morale is mixed\n\nThey haven't even reached Rome yet; Constantinople feels impossibly far\n\nSome may be questioning whether this voyage is cursed\n\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (persist across all outcomes):\n\n\nJuan shared the danger — stayed on deck through the storm, prayed at the bow\n\nHe went below to rally the knights when they were terrified\n\nHe ordered proper mourning time, didn't rush them back to sea\n\nThe speech is honest, humble — credits the sailors who saved them\n\nCalling them \"brothers\" and asking them to stand together reinforces unity\n\nThe moment of silence is dignified and appropriate\n\nThese men followed him through Granada; trust has been built\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (persist across all outcomes):\n\n\n142 dead is a heavy weight; grief doesn't lift with speeches\n\nSome may blame Juan for bringing them on this voyage\n\nThe speech is brief — some may want more explanation, more why\n\n\"Tomorrow we carry on\" may feel abrupt after such loss\n\nThe speech doesn't invoke God or divine mission strongly\n\nFear of what comes next is real — they haven't even left the Western Mediterranean\n\nMen who watched brothers drown in the harbor mouth may not be ready to hear about \"future deeds\"\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nHollow Words. The speech falls flat. The men hear humility and brevity, but they needed fire — a reason to believe the dead didn't die for nothing. The silence after your words stretches too long, becomes uncomfortable. A few men weep. Others stare at the ground. When it ends, they disperse quietly, but you hear the murmurs: Why are we doing this? Is God punishing us? Should we turn back? Morale is fragile. Some knights approach their commanders asking to be released from the expedition.\n11-20\nGrief Unlifted. The men respect the gesture. They appreciate the humility, the acknowledgment of the sailors. But grief sits too heavy; words cannot move it yet. The silence is observed, the ceremony completed, but the mood afterward is somber, almost sullen. They will follow orders — they are knights — but their hearts are not in it. The fire of the crusade has been doused. It will take more than speeches to rekindle it.\n21-35\nDutiful Acceptance. The speech is heard. The men bow their heads for the silence, murmur their prayers, return to their duties. But there is no spark, no sense of renewed purpose. They will sail to Rome because their king commands it, because they swore oaths, because there is nothing else to do. The dead are mourned. The living endure. It is enough for now, but only just.\n36-50\nQuiet Respect. The brevity and humility land as intended. The men don't need grand words today — they need their king to acknowledge the loss and promise to continue. You've done that. The silence is genuine, prayerful. Afterward, knights clasp each other's shoulders, speak quietly of the dead. They will sail. They will fight. But the shadow of the storm will travel with them.\n51-65\nSteadied Resolve. Something in the speech finds purchase — perhaps the call to stand together, perhaps the acknowledgment that seamen saved them. The knights draw closer, physically and otherwise. The silence becomes communal prayer. When it ends, Commander Mendoza starts the Non nobis — quietly at first, then building. Others join. Not triumphant, but steady. They will carry on, and they will mean it.\n66-80\nGrief Transformed. The honesty works. The humility works. The men have followed you through worse than storms — they remember Granada, remember the walls you climbed beside them. Your brief words remind them of who you are: not a king who makes speeches, but a king who stands in the danger with them. The silence stretches, and in it something shifts. When men lift their heads, there are tears — but also resolution. The dead will be honored with deeds. They believe it.\n81-90\nBrothers in Mourning. The call to stand together becomes literal — knights move toward the platform, toward each other, until the square is a tight press of white surcoats and crossed arms. The silence is profound. When it ends, a Santiago veteran begins to speak the names of the dead from his Order, and Calatrava takes up the call, then Alcántara. Each name spoken aloud, witnessed, remembered. By the end, the grief has been shared so completely that it has become bearable. These men will sail to the ends of the earth for each other.\n91-99\nForged in Loss. The speech transcends its words. The men hear what you don't say: I grieve with you. I was afraid with you. I will die with you if God wills it. The silence becomes sacred — six hundred men breathing together, praying together, mourning together. When it ends, no one moves. Then, without prompting, the knights kneel. All of them. A renewal of oaths, unspoken but unmistakable. They are yours, wholly, and they will follow you to Constantinople through any storm God sends.\n100\nConsecrated. As the silence stretches, the clouds part. Sunlight falls on the grave, on the banner, on the assembled knights — a shaft of gold in the grey Sardinian afternoon. Men gasp. Some fall to their knees. The Bishop of Cagliari crosses himself, murmuring about signs and wonders. Whether it is God's hand or mere weather, the timing is perfect. The expedition that limped into Cagliari broken sails out of it transformed — consecrated by loss, bound by shared grief, certain that the dead watch over them. This moment will be remembered for generations.\n\n\nReady for the roll?"

The speech is heard, respected, but doesn't kindle any fire. The men will follow orders because they're knights and they swore oaths, but there's no renewed passion or sense of purpose. The grief is too fresh, the losses too raw.\n\nI should narrate this outcome - showing the men's respectful but unenthusiastic response, the quiet dispersal, the sense that they'll continue but without the crusading fire. This sets up potential challenges for the rest of the voyage - a demoralized force that follows orders but lacks spirit.\n\nI should NOT generate any dialogue or action for Juan.

No surge of renewed purpose. No spontaneous hymn rising from the crowd. They heard you. They respected the gesture. They observed the silence with genuine grief.\n\n\nAnd now they are waiting to be dismissed.\n\n\nCommander Mendoza glances at you—a question in his eyes. Is that all? He was hoping for more. They all were, perhaps. Or perhaps they are simply too hollowed out by loss to feel anything but exhaustion.\n\n\nThe knights disperse slowly, quietly. Small groups form—men from the same Order, men who lost friends together, men who simply don't want to be alone. They speak in low voices. Some embrace. A few weep.\n\n\nBut no one approaches you with renewed oaths. No one speaks of Constantinople with eagerness. No one seems transformed.\n\n\nThey will sail to Rome because you command it. They will follow orders because they are knights, because they swore oaths, because there is nothing else to do now. The dead are buried. The living must continue.\n\n\nIt is enough.\n\n\nIt has to be enough.\n\n\n\nCommander Mendoza finds you afterward, as the square empties.\n\n\n\"The men will be ready to sail when you give the order, Majesty,\" he says. His voice is careful, neutral. \"The Madonna del Mare needs another three days of repairs. The other ships are seaworthy.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"Do we wait for the full repairs? Or sail with what we have and let her follow?\""

This is a sensible, practical decision that shows Juan learning from the disaster.\n\nNow I need to draft a new d100 table for the remainder of the journey from Cagliari to Rome (Ostia/Civitavecchia).\n\nLet me think about the context:\n- They've lost 142 men and 2 ships\n- Morale is dutiful but not inspired (roll of 23)\n- They're training crews on storm procedures\n- The Madonna del Mare is being repaired\n- Distance from Cagliari to Rome is roughly 300 nautical miles\n- They've already been through a devastating storm\n- It's mid-March now\n\nI should create a CHAOS ROLL for the journey, accounting for:\n- Weather (March Mediterranean)\n- Ship condition after repairs\n- Crew morale and training\n- Potential encounters (pirates, other ships)\n- The benefit of the training they're doing\n\nThe success factors should include the training and lessons learned. The failure factors should include lingering damage, low morale, and the unpredictable sea.\n\n\nMendoza nods, something like approval flickering across his weathered face.\n\n\n\"Wise, Majesty. The Genoese captains... some of them were slow in the storm. Merchant sailors, not navy. They know how to sail, but not how to fight a mistral.\" He rubs his jaw. \"I'll speak with Captain Sotomayor. He can drill them—signals for reefing sails, formation keeping in heavy weather. The men won't like being ordered about by a Castilian, but after what happened...\"\n\n\nHe doesn't need to finish. After what happened, even proud Genoese captains will listen.\n\n\n\nMarch 11-14, 1434\nCagliari Harbor\n\n\nThe days pass in productive misery.\n\n\nCaptain Sotomayor takes command of the training with grim efficiency. Every morning, the fleet practices storm signals—flags and lanterns and horn calls that mean reef sails now and follow the flagship and every ship for herself. The Genoese captains grumble but comply. Their crews learn.\n\n\nThe knights, meanwhile, drill on shipboard procedures. What to do when the order comes to go below. How to secure horses in heavy seas. How to work the pumps. How to stay out of the sailors' way. The lessons that should have been learned before Barcelona are learned now, written in the blood of 142 dead men.\n\n\nThe Madonna del Mare's repairs proceed quickly. Sardinian shipwrights work through the nights, and by the morning of March 14th, her new foremast stands tall against the grey sky.\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: VOYAGE FROM CAGLIARI TO ROME\n\n\nMarch 15-19, 1434 (estimated)\n\n\nType: CHAOS ROLL — The sea between Sardinia and the Italian coast. What does the final leg of the journey bring?\n\n\nJourney Details:\n\n\nDistance: ~250 nautical miles (Cagliari to Ostia/Civitavecchia)\n\nExpected time: 4-6 days depending on conditions\n\nFleet: 10 vessels (flagship, 3 carracks, 6 Genoese transports)\n\nPassengers: ~591 knights, royal family, reduced horses and supplies\n\nCrews have been drilled on storm procedures\n\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (persist across all outcomes):\n\n\nCrews trained specifically on storm response\n\nLessons learned from disaster—captains more cautious\n\nShips have been inspected and repaired\n\nShorter distance than Barcelona-Sardinia leg\n\nCaptain Sotomayor has established signal protocols\n\nWeather patterns typically improve as March progresses\n\nMen are sober, alert, taking nothing for granted\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (persist across all outcomes):\n\n\nMorale is dutiful, not inspired—men are going through motions\n\nSome ships still carry damage that repairs couldn't fully address\n\nReduced supplies after losses\n\nThe Mediterranean in March remains unpredictable\n\nTyrrhenian Sea has its own dangers—currents, rocky coasts\n\nPsychological weight of the disaster lingers\n\nSome crews may be overcautious now, slow to respond\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCursed Voyage. Another storm catches the fleet off the Sardinian coast—not as fierce as the mistral, but fierce enough. The training helps: no ships founder. But the Madonna del Mare's repairs fail. Her new mast cracks; she must turn back to Cagliari. The fleet limps into Ostia scattered, delayed by a week, morale shattered. Men speak openly of curses and divine punishment. The expedition arrives in Rome looking like refugees, not crusaders.\n6-15\nTroubled Passage. Heavy swells and contrary winds plague the crossing. No ships lost, but progress is agonizingly slow—eight days instead of five. Seasickness returns with a vengeance. Two horses die. A knight succumbs to fever, the first death since the storm. By the time Rome's coast appears, the men are exhausted, hollow-eyed. They've survived, but barely.\n16-25\nUneasy Crossing. The weather holds, mostly, but every squall sends panic through the fleet. The training helps—men respond quickly, sails are reefed at the first sign of trouble—but the fear never lifts. False alarms exhaust everyone. The fleet reaches Ostia in six days, intact but frayed. Morale has not recovered.\n26-40\nCautious Progress. The fleet sails conservatively—hugging the coast, anchoring at night, taking no chances. It adds two days to the journey, but there are no incidents. The men arrive in Rome tired but functional. The training paid off in discipline, if not in speed. Morale remains flat: dutiful, professional, uninspired.\n41-55\nAdequate Voyage. Variable winds, a day of rough weather that passes, the ordinary discomforts of shipboard travel. The training proves its worth: when a squall hits on day three, every ship responds correctly. No losses. The fleet reaches Rome in five days. The men are ready to be on solid ground, but they've made it.\n56-70\nSmooth Sailing. The weather finally cooperates. Clear skies, steady winds from the southwest, calm seas. The contrast with the mistral is almost disorienting. Men begin to relax—carefully at first, then genuinely. The fleet makes Rome in four days. When the Italian coast appears, someone actually cheers.\n71-80\nConfidence Restored. A textbook crossing. The training shows in every maneuver—signals answered promptly, formations held, even the Genoese captains moving like naval veterans. When a brief storm threatens on day two, the fleet responds beautifully: sails reefed in minutes, ships holding station, no panic. The storm passes without incident. The men arrive in Rome standing taller. They learned from the disaster. They are better now.\n81-90\nRedemption. The voyage becomes a healing. Calm seas, fair winds, and the growing coastline of Italy like a promise of solid ground. Knights who haven't spoken since the funeral begin to talk again, to pray together, to remember the dead with stories instead of silence. By the time the fleet enters the Tiber's mouth, something has shifted. The grief remains, but it no longer paralyzes. They are ready to face Rome.\n91-99\nProvidence. Perfect conditions, as if the sea is apologizing for what it took. The fleet makes Rome in three and a half days—exceptional time. More importantly, the swift and easy passage lifts the weight that has pressed on every man since Cagliari. A pod of dolphins escorts the Princesa Catalina for an afternoon; the men take it as a sign. When Rome appears on the horizon, the knights gather on deck and begin to sing—Salve Regina, rising across the water. They are whole again.\n100\nAnswered Prayers. As the fleet departs Cagliari, a knight reports a dream: the dead appeared to him, standing on the water, blessing the ships. Word spreads through the fleet. True or not, the vision transforms the mood. The crossing is flawless—three days of perfect sailing, not a single incident. And as the fleet approaches Ostia, fishing boats come out to meet them, their crews crossing themselves and pointing. Word has reached Rome ahead of them: The Castilians are coming. The crusaders who survived the storm. The city awaits.\n\n\nReady for the roll?"

This is a wonderful outcome after the disaster they experienced. Let me write a vivid, atmospheric narrative of this redemptive voyage.\n\nThe journey should:\n- Take 3.5 days (exceptional time)\n- Feature perfect conditions\n- Include dolphins escorting the Princesa Catalina\n- Show the psychological healing of the men\n- End with the knights singing Salve Regina as Rome appears\n- Show them becoming \"whole again\"\n\nI should write this as an immersive narrative, stopping when they arrive at Rome so Juan can react to the arrival. I shouldn't generate dialogue or actions for Juan.\n\n\nRoll: 95 — Providence\n\n\n\nMarch 15, 1434\nCagliari Harbor, Dawn\n\n\nThe fleet weighs anchor under skies of pale gold.\n\n\nThere is no fanfare this time. No cheering crowds, no bells. Just ten ships slipping out of harbor in tight formation, their crews silent, their knights subdued. The grave in the cathedral cemetery is still fresh. The memory of the San Giovanni rolling over in the harbor mouth will not fade for years.\n\n\nBut the sea that greets them is not the sea that tried to kill them.\n\n\nThe Mediterranean lies flat and gleaming, barely a ripple marring its surface. The wind comes from the southwest—steady, warm, impossibly gentle after the mistral's fury. Captain Sotomayor checks and rechecks his instruments, as if suspecting a trick.\n\n\n\"I've never seen conditions like this in March,\" he murmurs. \"Not in thirty years.\"\n\n\nBy noon, Sardinia has faded to a smudge on the horizon. By evening, the fleet has covered more distance than anyone expected.\n\n\n\nMarch 16, 1434\nOpen Water\n\n\nThe second day dawns clear and mild.\n\n\nSomething begins to shift in the men. It starts small—a knight making a joke at breakfast, another laughing instead of staring at his hands. The oppressive silence that has hung over the expedition since Cagliari starts to crack.\n\n\nIn the afternoon, a cry goes up from the Santa Cruz: dolphins.\n\n\nA pod of perhaps thirty, their grey backs arcing through the water, has taken up position alongside the Princesa Catalina. They ride the bow wave, leaping and diving, as if playing a game with the flagship.\n\n\nKnights crowd the rails to watch. Catalina has to be held back from climbing over the side to touch them.\n\n\n\"Papá, fish-horses!\" she shrieks, pointing. \"Fish-horses are dancing!\"\n\n\nThe dolphins stay with the fleet for hours. When they finally peel away toward open water, the men watch them go in silence—but it is a different silence than before. Wondering, not grieving.\n\n\nThat night, around the cookfires and in the cramped holds, men begin to speak of the dead not with hollow anguish but with something warmer. Stories emerge. Rodrigo from Santiago, who once drank a Genoese captain under the table. Old Martín of Calatrava, who could shoe a horse faster than any smith in Toledo. The quiet Alcántara sergeant whose name no one could pronounce, who prayed three times daily and never complained about anything.\n\n\nThe dead are remembered. And in the remembering, they become something other than weights to carry.\n\n\n\nMarch 17, 1434\nThe Tyrrhenian Sea\n\n\nThe third day brings the Italian coast.\n\n\nIt appears at dawn—a dark line on the eastern horizon, growing slowly, resolving into hills and cliffs and the pale shapes of coastal villages. The fleet adjusts course northward, following the shoreline toward the Tiber's mouth.\n\n\nThe weather holds. The wind holds. The sea remains impossibly calm.\n\n\nCommander Mendoza finds a moment between duties to stand at the rail, watching Italy grow closer. His face is still lined with grief—that will take months to fade, perhaps years—but something else is there now. Resolution. Purpose.\n\n\n\"Perhaps God took His price at the start,\" he says to no one in particular. \"Perhaps the rest of the voyage is paid for.\"\n\n\nIt is not theology. It is the hope of a man who needs to believe that the 142 dead bought something with their lives.\n\n\n\nMarch 18, 1434\nApproaching Ostia\n\n\nThree and a half days out of Cagliari. Exceptional time.\n\n\nThe fleet approaches the mouth of the Tiber in formation—battered, reduced, but together. The ten remaining ships fly their colors: the red and gold of Castile, the white crusade banner, the crosses of the three Military Orders.\n\n\nAnd then, from the deck of the Princesa Catalina, someone begins to sing.\n\n\nThe voice is rough, untrained—a common knight, not a chorister. But the words are unmistakable:\n\n\nSalve Regina, Mater misericordiae...\n\n\nAnother voice joins. Then another. The hymn spreads from ship to ship, carried across the water, swelling until six hundred voices rise together:\n\n\nVita, dulcedo, et spes nostra, salve...\n\n\nThe knights gather on deck, facing the approaching shore, singing to the land that holds Rome. Singing for the dead. Singing for themselves. Singing because they survived, because they are still here, because the sea gave them back when it could have taken everything.\n\n\nAd te clamamus, exsules filii Hevae...\n\n\nLucia appears at the rail beside you, Catalina in her arms. The child is quiet for once, watching the distant shore with wide eyes. Lucia's hand finds yours.\n\n\nThe song continues, echoing across the water, as the fleet enters the Tiber's mouth and Rome rises before you.\n\n\nO clemens, O pia, O dulcis Virgo Maria.\n\n\n\nThe Harbor at Ostia\nLate Afternoon\n\n\nThe harbor is crowded with boats—fishing vessels, merchant ships, river barges. But they have cleared a space for you. Word has traveled ahead.\n\n\nAs the Princesa Catalina approaches the dock, you see them: crowds lining the waterfront. Roman citizens, clergy, officials in formal robes. A delegation in papal colors waits at the foot of the main pier.\n\n\nAnd everywhere, the sign of the cross. Men crossing themselves as the crusade banner passes. Women holding up children to see. Old men kneeling on the stones.\n\n\nThey have heard about the storm. They have heard that the King of Castile lost a hundred men and came on anyway. They have heard that God's wind brought him to Rome in three days.\n\n\nThe gangplank is lowered.\n\n\nRome awaits."

Commander Mendoza bellows orders, forming them up on the quayside. They are battered, grief-marked, reduced from seven hundred to barely six hundred. But they stand straight. They hold formation. They are still an army.\n\n\nThe crowds press closer, held back by a thin line of papal guardsmen in yellow and red. You hear fragments of Italian, of Latin, voices calling out blessings and questions and the name Castiglia, Castiglia.\n\n\nCatalina stares at everything with enormous eyes.\n\n\n\"Many people,\" she observes. Then, pointing at a papal guard's plumed helmet: \"Papá, that man has a bird on his head.\"\n\n\nThe delegation in papal colors approaches. At its head walks a bishop in purple vestments, silver-haired, his face carefully composed into an expression of solemn welcome. Behind him, clerks and officials and a man in the robes of a notary, already writing something on a portable desk.\n\n\nThe bishop stops at a respectful distance, bows deeply, and waits to be acknowledged."

He should be polite but not overly forthcoming. He should ask questions rather than answer them directly.\n\nI should remember that Pope Eugenius IV is in a difficult position in 1434 - he's dealing with the Council of Basel, which is challenging papal authority. This is actually very relevant context. The Pope needs allies. But this bishop won't just say that.\n\nLet me write the bishop's response in a way that is:\n1. Polite and formal (as befits greeting a king)\n2. Deflects the direct question about the Pope's condition\n3. Steers toward information gathering\n4. Doesn't give away too much\n5. Has his own agenda\n\n\nThe bishop straightens from his bow. His eyes—pale grey, shrewd—flicker briefly over your salt-stained cloak, your storm-weathered face, the reduced ranks of knights forming up behind you. He is assessing. Calculating.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty honors us with your presence,\" he says smoothly. His Castilian is excellent, barely accented. \"I am Giuliano Ricci, Bishop of Ostia, and I bid you welcome to the Papal States in the name of His Holiness.\"\n\n\nHe does not answer your question about the Pope's health. Instead, he gestures toward the river, where a string of decorated barges wait at anchor.\n\n\n\"His Holiness has arranged for your party to travel to Rome by river—far more comfortable than the road, particularly for the Queen and the young Princess. Accommodations have been prepared at the Palazzo di San Marco.\" A pause, the slightest tightening around his eyes. \"We had expected... a larger party, Your Majesty. The reports from Barcelona spoke of seven hundred knights.\"\n\n\nHis gaze drifts to the ships, to the men still disembarking, counting.\n\n\n\"The journey was... eventful, perhaps?\"\n\n\nThe question hangs in the air.

They steer the conversation toward it.\n- NPC does not explain themselves. Juan must figure them out.\n- NPC does not help Juan without getting something first.\n\nWhat does Lucia want? What won't she say?\n\nLucia is Juan's wife, so her relationship is different from a political NPC. But she still has her own personality and concerns:\n- She was worried during the storm\n- She has been supportive but also challenged Juan in the past (about his certainty, about his \"hammer\" approach)\n- She is Italian - returning to Italy might bring up feelings about her homeland, her family\n- She might be thinking about her pregnancy (she conceived in January 1434, so she would be about 2 months pregnant now)\n- She might have complex feelings about Rome specifically - the papacy, Italian politics\n\nWhat won't she say directly?\n- Perhaps she's anxious about how Juan will be received\n- Perhaps she's thinking about her own family in Ferrara\n- Perhaps she has concerns about this journey that she hasn't voiced\n- Perhaps she misses Italy but also feels conflicted about it\n\nLet me write Lucia's response naturally, giving her depth without making her too helpful or too adversarial. She's his wife, but she's also her own person with her own thoughts.\n\n\nLucia settles onto the cushioned bench, arranging her skirts with the automatic grace of a woman raised in courts. Catalina curls against her, thumb finding its way to her mouth—a habit she's been breaking, but exhaustion has its own rules.\n\n\nThe barge pushes off from the dock. The oarsmen find their rhythm. Ostia begins to slide away.\n\n\n\"Once,\" Lucia says. \"When I was twelve. My father brought me for a papal audience—some matter of Ferrarese politics I didn't understand at the time.\"\n\n\nShe watches the riverbank pass—marshes giving way to farmland, the occasional villa perched on a hill.\n\n\n\"I remember being disappointed. I expected... I don't know. Golden streets, perhaps. Angels on every corner.\" A small smile. \"Instead I found mud and beggars and cardinals who looked at my father like wolves sizing up a lamb.\"\n\n\nShe is quiet for a moment. Her hand rests on her stomach—a gesture so subtle you might miss it.\n\n\n\"Rome devours people, Juan. It smiles and flatters and whispers, and when you turn your back...\" She doesn't finish.\n\n\nThe Tiber curves ahead, brown and sluggish. In the distance, the first shapes of Rome's outskirts are beginning to emerge.\n\n\n\"The bishop wanted to know what you want,\" Lucia says. \"Everyone here will want to know that.

From Chapter 2.14 Summary:\n- \"Rome Visit — Return of sacred relics, meeting Pope Eugenius IV\"\n\nFrom Chapter 2.13 Summary and others, it seems the relics were still with Juan as of Chapter 2.14.\n\nFrom Chapter 2.16 Summary:\n- \"Rome Visit: Meeting with Pope Eugenius IV, returning sacred relics, coordinating on Constantinople\"\n\nSo it seems the relics have NOT yet been returned - this current trip to Rome is when Juan plans to return them.\n\nBut the user is saying \"we already visited Rome earlier and have returned the crusade treasury, accounting and relics to the pope.\"\n\nHmm, let me check the CHARACTER_DATABASE again:\n\nFrom the database, about Pope Martin V:\n- \"Received Juan II in Rome (July 29, 1430)\"\n- \"Provided 20,000 florins, True Cross fragment, Santiago bone\"\n\nAnd from Chapter 44 in the summaries:\n- \"Captain Fernán: Carried Santiago's bone in Te Deum procession (April 5, 1433)\"\n\nSo the relics were still with Juan at the Te Deum in Granada. \n\nI'm detecting a potential timeline discrepancy that requires careful investigation. The user's statement suggests a Rome visit and relic return that isn't reflected in the current chapter summaries. There might be an undocumented event between the Te Deum and the current timeline that I'm not seeing in the available documentation.\n\nThe player's narrative correction indicates Juan has already completed a significant diplomatic mission to Rome, returning crusade materials to Pope Eugenius IV. This means the upcoming March 1434 visit has different strategic objectives focused on multiple diplomatic negotiations.\n\nKey diplomatic goals for this Rome visit include securing university permissions, discussing Constantinople, supporting Alfonso V's Naples claim, and negotiating Military Order control. I'll adjust my understanding to align with the player's established campaign narrative.\n\n\nLucia nods.\n\n\n\"The documents are safe. Don Bernat has them in the strongbox aboard the second barge—your letter, the Emperor's missive, the petition for the university charter.\" She counts them off on her fingers. \"And the letters regarding King Alfonso's claim to Naples, yes?\"\n\n\nShe adjusts Catalina's weight slightly.\n\n\n\"It is strange to return here under such different circumstances. Last time you came bearing gifts—the relics, the treasury, the accounting of every florin spent in God's name.\" A small smile. \"The cardinals could hardly believe it. A king who returns money to the Church instead of demanding more.\"\n\n\nThe dome of St. Peter's looms larger now, catching the fading light.\n\n\n\"This time you come with requests. The university. Support against the Council. Whatever you mean to ask regarding Constantinople.\" She glances at you. \"And the Military Orders—you still intend to petition for permanent control?\"\n\n\nThe barge slows as it approaches a landing. Servants in papal livery wait on the dock. Beyond them, you can see carriages bearing the arms of the Vatican.\n\n\n\"The Pope received your gifts graciously last time,\" Lucia says. \"But receiving is easy. Giving is harder. Especially for Rome.\"\n\n\nHer eyes meet yours.\n\n\n\"What will you do if he refuses?\""

Let me summarize what I've found:\n\n1. **The papal decree has already been signed** - Pope Eugenius IV signed *Fidei Defensio et Corona Triumphans* in April 1433, which granted Juan:\n   - Perpetual control over the Military Orders (Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara)\n   - Support for Alfonso V's claim to Naples\n\n2. **The new purpose for the Military Orders** was discussed at the Toledo meeting with the Masters:\n   - They were granted Granada fortresses (distributed by region)\n   - They were given naval ports to transition to fighting piracy\n   - Their first naval mission: fight piracy (Salé identified as primary corsair base)\n   - They're sending knights to Constantinople (Sotomayor was appointed commander of the vanguard of 300 knights; Juan is bringing the remaining 700)\n\n3. **What Juan is bringing to discuss with the Pope now:**\n   - Aid for Constantinople (this is ongoing - he's delivering the 700 knights)\n   - Dual legislation of Council of Basel laws\n   - Navigate Basel situation per the Como letters\n   - Granada University grant\n   - The Military Orders issue is already resolved via the April 1433 decree\n\nSo the user's question about Military Orders - the Pope has already granted perpetual control. The \"new purpose\" discussion was internal with the Masters, not with the Pope.\n\nLet me provide this clarification to the user.\n\n\n\nGM Clarification:\n\n\nYou are correct that you already visited Rome in April 1433 and met with Pope Eugenius IV. At that meeting, he signed the papal decree Fidei Defensio et Corona Triumphans, which granted you:\n\n\nPerpetual control of the Military Orders — already done. The Masters now serve under crown authority.\n\nSupport for Alfonso V's Naples claim — already done. The Pope recognized Alfonso's claim over René of Anjou.\n\n\nThe Military Orders' new purpose was discussed internally at your Toledo meeting with the Masters (July 1433), not with the Pope. You granted them:\n\n\nGranada fortresses (distributed by region: Santiago central, Calatrava eastern, Alcántara western)\n\nNaval ports to transition to fighting piracy (Santiago: Almuñécar; Calatrava: Almería; Alcántara: Marbella)\n\nThe Constantinople mission (Sotomayor led the 300-knight vanguard; you're bringing the remaining ~600)\n\n\nSo your current agenda with Pope Eugenius IV is:\n\n\nConstantinople aid — requesting papal support, funds, or calls for other Christian kingdoms to assist\n\nDual legislation — asking the Pope to co-sign laws passed by the Council of Basel, legitimizing both papal and conciliar authority\n\nNavigate Basel — per the Como letters you and Emperor Sigismund signed, supporting papal authority while acknowledging legitimate reform concerns\n\nGranada University charter — seeking papal approval for a university focused on natural philosophy and sciences (not theology)\n\n\nIs there anything else you wish to add before arriving at the Palazzo di San Marco?"

To reassert papal authority over the Council of Basel - he tried to dissolve it and failed, was humiliated\n2. To not appear weak or capitulating to conciliar demands\n3. To use Juan's support and the Castilian-Imperial alliance to strengthen his position against the Council\n4. Money and military support for his own problems (the Papal States are threatened)\n5. To drive a wedge between Juan and the Council if possible, or at least ensure Juan supports papal supremacy over conciliar supremacy\n6. To not be seen as merely rubber-stamping Council decisions\n\n**What won't he say?**\n1. That he's desperate for allies against the Council\n2. That he sees Juan as a potential tool/weapon against Basel\n3. That he resents the \"parallel legislation\" idea because it still validates the Council's authority\n4. His true feelings about having been forced to back down publicly\n5. That he's suspicious of the Sigismund-Juan alliance (Sigismund has his own interests)\n6. That he's worried about how strong Juan is becoming\n\n**Historical context from research:**\n- Eugenius IV is a hardliner on papal supremacy\n- He tried to dissolve Basel and failed publicly\n- Every concession feels like defeat\n- He's backed into a corner of his own making\n- He already gave Juan a lot (Military Orders, Naples support) - what more can Juan want?\n\n**The \"parallel legislation\" problem:**\nJuan's proposal sounds reasonable but from Eugenius's perspective:\n- It still means the Pope is essentially copying what the Council does\n- It validates the Council's reforms as legitimate\n- It could be seen as the Pope following the Council's lead\n- Eugenius might prefer to simply assert papal authority and ignore Basel entirely\n\n**Constantinople:**\n- Eugenius might want to help Constantinople but lacks resources\n\n\n- He might strategically support Juan's expedition without direct commitment\n- Carefully positioning himself to claim potential success while avoiding financial or political risk\n\nI see an opportunistic papal strategy emerging. Eugenius will likely offer diplomatic support that costs him nothing, positioning himself to potentially claim credit for Juan's potential victories while maintaining plausible deniability about direct involvement. His primary goal remains protecting papal authority and undermining the Council of Basel's influence.\n\n\n\nThe Palazzo di San Marco\nRome, March 18-21, 1434\n\n\nThe palazzo is a fortress dressed as a residence—thick walls softened by Venetian tapestries, arrow-slit windows hung with silk curtains. Cardinal Pietro Barbo, the papal nephew who owns it, has vacated his own chambers for the Castilian king. The message is clear: Rome honors you.\n\n\nBut Rome also watches you.\n\n\nFor three days, you wait.\n\n\nThe official explanation is that His Holiness requires time to prepare a proper reception for so illustrious a guest. The unofficial explanation—whispered by Don Bernat de Centelles, who knows Roman ways—is that Eugenius is taking your measure. Seeing who visits you. What you do with idle time. Whether you grow impatient.\n\n\nYou don't.\n\n\nLucia keeps the household running smoothly. Catalina discovers the palazzo's garden and declares the orange trees her personal property. Commander Mendoza drills the knights in their camp beyond the walls, keeping them sharp and visible. You attend Mass at three different churches, are seen praying at the tombs of martyrs, and donate generously to a hospital for pilgrims.\n\n\nRome watches. Rome whispers. The King of Castile lost a hundred men at sea and came on anyway. The King of Castile prays like a monk and fights like a devil.\n\n\nOn the morning of the fourth day, the summons comes.\n\n\n\nThe Vatican Palace\nMarch 22, 1434\n\n\nThe audience chamber is smaller than you expected—intimate, even. No throne room grandeur here. Eugenius IV receives you in what might be a private study, seated behind a desk covered with papers, attended by only three cardinals and a handful of scribes.\n\n\nThe Pope himself is a slight man in his early fifties, with the face of an ascetic—hollow cheeks, deep-set eyes that miss nothing. He wears simple white robes, unadorned. No jewels. No gold. The austerity is deliberate, you suspect. A statement.\n\n\nHe does not rise as you enter.\n\n\n\nNPC ANALYSIS — Pope Eugenius IV\n\n\nWhat does he want?\n\n\nTo reassert papal authority after the humiliation of his failed attempt to dissolve Basel\n\nTo use Juan's support as a weapon against the Council—but on his terms\n\nTo avoid any appearance of capitulating to conciliar demands\n\nTo extract maximum value from Juan while conceding minimum\n\nTo ensure Juan leaves Rome committed to papal supremacy, not \"neutrality\"\n\n\nWhat won't he say?\n\n\nThat he's desperate for allies and sees Juan as a lifeline\n\nThat the \"parallel legislation\" proposal offends him deeply (it still validates Basel)\n\nThat he resents how much he already gave Juan in April 1433 (Military Orders, Naples support)\n\nThat he suspects the Sigismund-Juan alliance may not serve papal interests\n\nThat he's worried about how powerful Castile is becoming\n\n\n\n\"King Juan.\" The Pope's voice is dry, precise. \"We have followed your journey with great interest. The storm. The losses. Your persistence despite them.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to a chair—not beside him, but across the desk. The posture of a banker receiving a client.\n\n\n\"You carry documents, We are told. From yourself and from the Emperor.\" His eyes flicker to the leather satchel in Don Bernat's hands. \"We confess curiosity. The last time you visited Rome, you brought Us relics and treasure.

Cardinal Aleman forces a vote on papal deposition. The Como Declaration is denounced as \"imperial-papal conspiracy.\" The Castilian delegation is marginalized, accused of being papal agents. Abbott Rodrigo suffers a collapse from the stress and is bedridden. Emperor Sigismund storms out of Basel in fury. The Council splits into open factions. No reforms pass. The crusade decree is dead. Schism looms.\n6-15\nBitter Stalemate. The French faction blocks everything connected to the Como signatories. Every reform proposal is tied up in procedural challenges. The crusade decree never reaches general congregation. Bohemian negotiations stall over property questions. Sigismund and the Castilians coordinate, but coordination means nothing when votes cannot be won. Nine months of exhausting labor produce nothing. Abbott Rodrigo's health deteriorates.\n16-25\nMinimal Progress. One minor reform passes (clerical concubinage restrictions). The crusade decree advances to general congregation but is amended into meaninglessness—vague language, no concrete commitments, no timeline. Bohemian negotiations continue but reach no conclusion. The Como Declaration is noted but not embraced. Sigismund grows frustrated. The delegation holds the line but gains no ground.\n26-40\nGrinding Effort, Mixed Results. Two reforms pass (concubinage restrictions, some limits on pluralism for new appointments only). The crusade decree passes in weak form—calls for Christian unity against the Turk but commits no resources, sets no timeline, names no leader. Bohemians agree to communion in both kinds in principle but property question remains unresolved. The Como position is respected but not adopted. Parallel legislation remains theoretical.\n41-55\nPartial Success. Three reforms pass (concubinage, pluralism limits, some annates restrictions). The crusade decree passes with moderate language—acknowledges Constantinople's peril, calls on Christian princes to aid the Greeks, but stops short of formal crusade declaration. Bohemian compacts are drafted but not yet signed. The Como Declaration is debated seriously; some Cardinals see merit in parallel legislation. Sigismund and the Castilians are seen as the moderate center.\n56-70\nSolid Progress. Four reforms pass, including meaningful annates cap (one-quarter of first year's revenue). The crusade decree passes with real teeth—names the Ottoman threat explicitly, calls on all Christian princes to contribute, establishes framework for coordination. Bohemian compacts signed in principle (communion in both kinds granted, property question deferred). The Como position gains traction; Cardinal Cesarini privately supports parallel legislation. Castilian delegation acclaimed as bridge-builders.\n71-80\nSignificant Achievement. All five major reforms pass (concubinage, pluralism, annates cap, electoral restoration, oversight commission framework). Crusade decree passes strongly—formal call to defend Constantinople, explicit timeline, named coordinators. Bohemian compacts signed, ending thirty-five years of war (property question kicked to future negotiation). Parallel legislation concept formally proposed to Eugenius by Cardinal Cesarini with Sigismund's endorsement. The Como Declaration is seen as a breakthrough.\n81-90\nMajor Victory. All reforms pass with strong language. Crusade decree passes unanimously—formal crusade declared against Ottoman threat to Constantinople, with specific commitments from multiple kingdoms. Bohemian reconciliation complete (compacts signed, moderate Hussites return to communion). Cardinal Cesarini writes to Eugenius urging parallel legislation in strongest terms. The Imperial-Castilian alliance dominates the moderate center. French radicals marginalized. Abbott Rodrigo hailed as elder statesman.\n91-99\nTransformation. The Council, energized by Imperial-Castilian coordination, becomes a genuine reform body. All major reforms pass. Crusade decree passes with extraordinary support—multiple kingdoms pledge specific forces and funds. Bohemian reconciliation achieved with face-saving property compromise. Eugenius signals through intermediaries that he will consider parallel legislation seriously. Basel and Rome begin genuine dialogue. The threat of schism recedes. Castile's reputation soars.\n100\nThe Como Miracle. Against all odds, the Council unites behind the Como vision. Reforms pass unanimously. The crusade decree becomes a rallying cry—kingdoms across Europe pledge support for Constantinople. Bohemia reconciles fully, ending a generation of bloodshed. Eugenius, moved by the Council's genuine reform spirit (and pressured by the Imperial-Castilian alliance), issues parallel legislation on three major reforms. Pope and Council, for the first time in years, work together. The schism threat evaporates. Juan arrives in Rome to find the Church healing rather than breaking.\n\n\nReady for the roll?"

It changes the dynamic of his meeting with Eugenius significantly.\n\nLet me write this out as news Juan received and then continue to the papal audience.\n\n\nRoll: 91 — Transformation\n\n\n\nWhat Juan Knows\n(From delegation correspondence received in Toledo and Barcelona, October 1433 — February 1434)\n\n\n\nThe letters arrived in bundles—first monthly, then weekly as events accelerated. Abbott Rodrigo's hand grew shakier as the months passed, but his mind remained sharp. Bishop Alfonso's reports were precise, detailed, analytical. Together, they painted a picture Juan could scarcely believe.\n\n\nJuly 1433: Emperor Sigismund arrived at Basel like a thunderclap. Sixty-five years old, exhausted, but still commanding. He summoned the German delegation the first night and made clear: the Empire stands with Castile. The Como Declaration is imperial policy. Those who oppose it oppose the Emperor.\n\n\nAugust 1433: The French faction overplayed its hand. Cardinal Aleman attempted to force a procedural vote that would have sidelined the Imperial-Castilian position. Sigismund responded by threatening to withdraw entirely and call his own council in German lands. The French backed down. The moderate center held.\n\n\nSeptember 1433: The first reform passed—genuine restrictions on clerical concubinage, with enforcement mechanisms. Then pluralism limits for new appointments. Then, remarkably, the annates cap: one-quarter of first year's revenue, Camera Apostolica transparency, right of appeal. Three reforms in six weeks. More than the previous two years combined.\n\n\nOctober 1433: The Bohemian breakthrough. The Hussites, watching Granada's fall and Castile's rising prestige, began to wonder if resistance was wise. Sigismund—their nominal king, whom they had fought for thirty years—offered a face-saving compromise: communion in both kinds granted immediately, property questions deferred to a joint commission that would take years to resolve. The moderate Utraquists accepted. The radical Taborites were isolated.\n\n\nNovember 1433: The Compacts of Basel signed. Thirty-five years of war ended with ink, not blood. Bohemia returned to communion with Rome—imperfectly, conditionally, but returned. Bishop Alfonso wrote: \"I wept, Your Majesty. Old men who had fought five crusades against each other embraced in the cathedral. God's work, accomplished through patience and compromise.\"\n\n\nDecember 1433: The crusade decree. Not the weak, meaningless version that had stalled in June—a real declaration. The Ottoman threat named explicitly. Constantinople's peril acknowledged. A formal call to all Christian princes to contribute forces and funds. The Duke of Burgundy pledged ships. The Venetians offered naval support. Hungary promised coordination. Multiple kingdoms, for the first time, speaking with one voice about the Eastern threat.\n\n\nJanuary 1434: Cardinal Cesarini, acting on his own authority, wrote directly to Pope Eugenius proposing the parallel legislation framework. His letter cited the Como Declaration, the success of the reforms, the Bohemian reconciliation, the crusade decree. \"Holy Father,\" he wrote, \"the Council has proven it can reform without rebellion. If Your Holiness leads this reform rather than opposing it, the Church will be strengthened, not weakened. The King of Castile and the Emperor have shown us the way.\"\n\n\nFebruary 1434: Eugenius's response arrived at Basel—not public, not official, but unmistakable. Through intermediaries, the Pope signaled that he would consider parallel legislation on the three major reforms already passed. Not acceptance. Not rejection. A door left open.\n\n\nAbbott Rodrigo's final letter before Juan departed Barcelona:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am seventy-four years old. I have seen the Great Schism, the burning of Hus, the wars of Bohemia, the chaos of three popes. I never expected to see what I have seen these past months. The Church is not healed—let no one claim that. But she is no longer bleeding. The threat of schism has receded. Reform is possible. And when men speak of how this happened, they speak of Como. They speak of the Emperor and the King of Castile who refused to choose sides and instead showed both sides a better path.\n\n\nCome to Rome, Your Majesty. Come to Basel. See what God has wrought through your patience and your faith.\"\n\n\n\nThe Vatican Palace\nMarch 22, 1434\n\n\nYou stand before Pope Eugenius IV with this knowledge burning in your mind.\n\n\nThe Pope who tried to dissolve Basel and failed. The Pope who has spent three years fighting a council that now—against all expectation—has become a genuine reform body. The Pope who has been outmaneuvered, outflanked, and pressured into considering the very framework you and Sigismund proposed nine months ago.\n\n\nHe does not know exactly what you know. But he knows you have been receiving letters from Basel. He knows the Como Declaration came from you. He knows that the alliance which transformed the Council bears your signature.\n\n\nHe sits behind his desk, watching you with those hollow, ascetic eyes.\n\n\n\"What is it you wish to discuss, King of Castile?\"\n\n\n\nNPC REMINDER — Pope Eugenius IV\n\n\nWhat does he want?\n\n\nTo reassert papal authority after years of humiliation\n\nTo ensure any \"parallel legislation\" is seen as papal leadership, not submission to Basel\n\nTo extract maximum value from Juan while conceding minimum\n\nTo ensure Juan leaves committed to papal supremacy, not neutrality\n\nTo understand how much Juan knows and how much leverage Juan thinks he has\n\n\nWhat won't he say?\n\n\nThat he's grateful for the Como Declaration (it saved him from worse outcomes)\n\nThat he resents owing Juan anything\n\nThat he's terrified the Council will still depose him if he refuses to cooperate\n\nThat he sees Juan as dangerously powerful and needs to be managed\n\nThat he's already decided to accept parallel legislation but wants Juan to pay for it"

      "say": "Thought process: Enumerated nine substantive issues requiring player decisions for decree structure.\n\nThe user wants me to analyze what decisions need to be made for the Decree on Clerical Concubinage before drafting it. Let me think about what the historical research tells us and what aspects might need player input.\n\nBased on my research:\n\n1. **Historical context**: The Council of Basel passed a decree against clerical concubinage on January 22, 1435 (in real history). In our alternate timeline, with the roll of 91, this was moved up to September 1433 due to the energizing effect of the Como Declaration and Imperial-Castilian coordination.\n\n2. **What the decree historically addressed**:\n- Prohibition of clergy keeping concubines\n- Penalties for violations (admonitions, suspensions, deprivation of benefice)\n- Enforcement mechanisms through episcopal visitations\n- The status of children born to such unions\n- Whether penalties apply retroactively or only prospectively\n\n3. **Key issues that could vary and might need player decision**:\n\n**Issue 1: Scope of Application**\n- Does it apply to all clergy (major and minor orders)?\n- Does it include religious (monks, friars) as well as secular clergy?\n\n**Issue 2: Definition of Concubinage**\n- How is \"concubine\" defined? (woman living in household vs. any illicit relationship)\n- Does it cover occasional fornication or only ongoing cohabitation?\n\n**Issue 3: Penalty Structure**\n- First offense: Warning/admonition\n- Second offense: Suspension from office and revenues\n- Third offense: Deprivation of benefice\n- How harsh should each level be? How long between warnings?\n\n**Issue 4: Grace Period / Grandfathering**\n- Is there a period for clergy to dismiss concubines before penalties apply?\n- What happens to clergy who have had concubines for years?\n\n**Issue 5: Children of Concubines**\n- Can children of priests inherit from their fathers?\n- Are they barred from ecclesiastical offices?\n\n\n- This was a major issue because many clergy had children\n\nThe decree must carefully consider the status of women involved with clergy. Potential approaches include expulsion or more nuanced punitive measures. Enforcement mechanisms are crucial, involving church hierarchies from bishops to papal legates. Accountability becomes complex when church leaders themselves might be implicated. Provincial synods could play a critical monitoring role, ensuring consistent implementation across different regions.\n\nLaymen protecting clerical concubines and bishops failing to enforce regulations require clear consequences. Evidence standards become paramount - determining whether reputation alone suffices for punishment or more concrete proof is necessary. The goal is a balanced approach: strong enough to compel change, yet pastoral in its sensitivity.\n\n\nBased on my research, here are the key issues we should decide before drafting the Decree on Clerical Concubinage:\n\n\n\nISSUES TO DECIDE FOR THE CONCUBINAGE DECREE\n\n\nIssue 1: Scope of Application\n\n\nOption A (Narrow): Major orders only (subdeacons, deacons, priests, bishops)\n\nOption B (Broad): All clergy including minor orders (porters, lectors, exorcists, acolytes) and religious (monks, friars, canons regular)\n\n\nHistorical note: Most medieval legislation focused on major orders, but reformers often wanted broader scope.\n\n\n\nIssue 2: Definition\n\n\nOption A (Strict): Any woman cohabiting with a cleric, regardless of circumstances\n\nOption B (Moderate): Woman maintained in ongoing relationship with carnal knowledge, distinguished from housekeepers (who must be above suspicion—typically relatives or elderly women)\n\n\nThis matters because many clergy had female servants; the question is where to draw the line.\n\n\n\nIssue 3: Penalty Structure\n\n\nHow severe should the graduated penalties be?\n\nOffense\nLenient\nModerate\nSevere\nFirst\nPrivate warning\nPublic admonition + 60-day grace period\nImmediate suspension of revenues\nSecond\nSuspension 3 months\nSuspension 6 months + loss of 1/3 revenues\nFull suspension + loss of all revenues\nThird\nLoss of benefice (can appeal)\nPerpetual deprivation\nDeprivation + degradation + imprisonment\n\n\nIssue 4: Grace Period\n\n\nShould clergy with existing concubines have time to comply?\n\n\nOption A: 60 days from publication of decree\n\nOption B: 90 days from publication\n\nOption C: No grace period—immediate compliance required\n\n\n\nIssue 5: Children of Clergy (Contentious!)\n\n\nThis was a major issue—many priests had children.\n\n\nOption A (Strict): Children of priests barred from all ecclesiastical benefices forever; cannot inherit temporal goods from clerical father\n\nOption B (Moderate): Children barred from benefices in father's church only; can inherit temporal goods; can receive other benefices by papal dispensation\n\nOption C (Lenient): Children can receive benefices elsewhere with episcopal approval; full inheritance rights\n\n\n\nIssue 6: The Women\n\n\nWhat happens to the concubines themselves?\n\n\nOption A: No penalty specified (decree focuses on clergy only)\n\nOption B: Excommunication if they refuse to leave after cleric is warned\n\nOption C: Subject to episcopal penance; barred from church until reconciled\n\n\n\nIssue 7: Episcopal Enforcement\n\n\nWho enforces, and what if enforcers are guilty?\n\n\nOption A: Bishops enforce in their dioceses; guilty bishops referred to metropolitan archbishop\n\nOption B: Provincial synods required annually to investigate; oversight commission receives reports\n\nOption C: Papal legates given authority to investigate bishops directly\n\n\nWith the roll of 91, the oversight commission from the Como Declaration is likely incorporated.\n\n\n\nIssue 8: Evidentiary Standard\n\n\nHow is guilt established?\n\n\nOption A (Strict proof): Two credible witnesses required; accused can purge themselves by oath with compurgators\n\nOption B (Public fame): If notorious public reputation (fama publica) exists, bishop can proceed without formal accusation\n\nOption C (Mixed): Fama publica triggers investigation; conviction requires witnesses or confession\n\n\n\nMY RECOMMENDATIONS (Given Roll 91)\n\n\nGiven the \"Transformation\" outcome and the spirit of genuine reform:\n\nIssue\nRecommendation\nRationale\nScope\nBroad (Option B)\nReal reform requires comprehensive application\nDefinition\nModerate (Option B)\nDistinguishes genuine concubinage from legitimate household arrangements\nPenalties\nModerate\nGraduated system that allows repentance while having teeth\nGrace Period\n90 days\nPastoral, allows compliance without immediate chaos\nChildren\nModerate (Option B)\nBalances reform with mercy; doesn't punish children for fathers' sins absolutely\nWomen\nOption A\nFocus on clergy; involving women creates enforcement nightmares\nEnforcement\nOption B + C elements\nProvincial synods + oversight commission reflects Como Declaration\nEvidence\nMixed (Option C)\nFama publica initiates; proof required for deprivation\n\n\nDo you want to decide each issue, or shall I proceed with these recommendations? Are there any issues you want to handle differently given Juan's preferences or the Castilian delegation's influence?"

Three prelates and two canon lawyers monitor enforcement across the universal church.\n\nPastoral Mercy — The 90-day grace period and graduated penalties allow repentance without immediate destruction of careers.\n\nChildren Protected (Partially) — They're not completely barred from church careers, just from their father's specific church. A moderate position.\n\nEnforcement Teeth — Annual synods, mandatory reporting, and penalties for negligent bishops address the historical problem of decrees that were passed but never enforced.\n\n\n\nShall I proceed to the next document?

Key points:\n\n1. The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) Canon 29 already addressed pluralism - forbidding anyone from holding several ecclesiastical dignities and several parish churches\n2. If someone with a benefice with cure of souls took another, they automatically vacated the first\n3. Dispensations from Rome were easily obtained, which undermined the legislation\n4. The problem was that despite the law, pluralism persisted due to lack of enforcement and easy dispensations\n\nNow I need to determine what issues to decide for our Basel decree on pluralism. Based on the research:\n\n**Key Issues to Decide:**\n\n1. **Scope of Benefices Covered:**\n- Major benefices only (bishoprics, abbacies)?\n- All benefices with cure of souls (parishes)?\n- All benefices including sinecures (prebends, canonries)?\n\n2. **Grandfathering:**\n- Do existing pluralists keep their benefices?\n- Must they resign all but one within a time limit?\n- Compromise: existing arrangements honored, new appointments restricted?\n\n3. **Dispensations:**\n- Abolish papal dispensations for pluralism entirely?\n- Limit dispensations to specific cases (near poverty benefices)?\n- Cap number of benefices even with dispensation?\n\n4. **Exemptions:**\n- Cardinals (traditionally held multiple benefices)?\n- University professors needing support?\n- Royal chaplains and other court clergy?\n\n5. **Distinction: Benefices with/without cure of souls:**\n- Stricter for benefices with cure (parishes, bishoprics) - people's souls at stake\n- More lenient for benefices without cure (cathedral canonries, prebends)?\n\n6. **Enforcement:**\n- Automatic vacancy if second benefice accepted?\n- Who decides if dispensation was valid?\n- Penalties for conferrers who give benefices to pluralists?\n\n7. **Income Threshold:**\n- Allow holding poor benefices together if combined income doesn't exceed X?\n\n\n- Prevent wealthy clergy from accumulating while poor parishes go unstaffed?\n\nConsidering the Castilian delegation's influence and existing Electoral Reform Decree, I'll craft a strategic approach. The decree will target new appointments, prioritizing benefices with cure of souls, implementing strict dispensation limits and robust enforcement mechanisms. This targeted strategy addresses systemic issues of ecclesiastical resource distribution while respecting existing clerical arrangements.\n\n\nBased on my research, here are the key issues for the Decree on Pluralism:\n\n\n\nISSUES FOR THE DECREE ON PLURALISM AND MULTIPLE BENEFICES\n\n\nHistorical Context\n\n\nThe Fourth Lateran Council (1215), Canon 29, already forbade holding multiple benefices with cure of souls. But it failed because:\n\n\nPapal dispensations were easily obtained\n\nNo enforcement mechanism existed\n\nExisting pluralists were grandfathered indefinitely\n\n\nBy 1433, the abuse had grown scandalous—cardinals holding six or seven bishoprics, cathedral canons with a dozen prebends across Europe, parish priests with three or four cures they never visited.\n\n\n\nIssue 1: Grandfathering Existing Arrangements\n\n\nThis was the most politically contentious question at Basel. Many council fathers themselves held multiple benefices.\n\n\nOption A (Radical): All pluralists must resign all but one benefice within one year—no exceptions\n\nOption B (Moderate): Existing arrangements honored for life of current holder, but cannot be renewed or transferred; new appointments restricted\n\nOption C (Conservative): Existing arrangements fully protected; decree applies only to future appointments\n\n\nThe Como Declaration specified: \"We support limiting accumulation of titles going forward. Grandfather existing arrangements—respect lawfully obtained positions.\"\n\n\nRecommendation given Como: Option B or C\n\n\n\nIssue 2: Scope — Which Benefices?\n\n\nMajor benefices (episcopates, abbacies): One only, absolutely no exceptions\n\nBenefices with cure of souls (parishes, priories with pastoral duties): One only\n\nBenefices without cure of souls (canonries, prebends, sinecures): Allow limited accumulation?\n\n\nKey distinction: cure of souls means responsible for people's salvation. Sinecures are just income.\n\n\n\nIssue 3: Dispensations\n\n\nThe loophole that destroyed previous legislation.\n\n\nOption A (Abolish): No dispensations for pluralism, period\n\nOption B (Strict Limits): Dispensations only for: (a) very poor benefices that together barely support one man, (b) benefices within walking distance of each other, (c) granted by ordinary, not Rome\n\nOption C (Reform but Preserve): Dispensations still available from Rome but must state genuine reason; Camera Apostolica must publish list of all dispensations granted\n\n\n\nIssue 4: Exemptions\n\n\nWho is exempt from the one-benefice rule?\n\n\nCardinals? — Traditionally held multiple bishoprics to support their role. This is extremely sensitive.\n\nUniversity professors? — Benefices often supported scholars; without them, no teachers\n\nRoyal chaplains? — Kings expected to reward their clergy with benefices\n\n\nHistorically, Basel attacked cardinals' accumulation of benefices as a major abuse.\n\n\n\nIssue 5: Incompatible Benefices\n\n\nSome benefices cannot possibly be held together because they require physical presence in different places:\n\n\nTwo parishes in different dioceses\n\nA bishopric and a parish in another diocese\n\nAn abbacy requiring residence and a deanery elsewhere\n\n\nShould the decree specifically address geographic incompatibility?\n\n\n\nIssue 6: Enforcement\n\n\nWho verifies that a candidate for a benefice doesn't already hold an incompatible one?\n\nWhat happens to benefices conferred in violation of this decree?\n\nPenalties for conferrers (bishops, abbots, patrons) who knowingly confer on pluralists?\n\n\n\nIssue 7: Income Threshold\n\n\nAllow holding multiple benefices if combined income doesn't exceed a threshold?\n\n\nPro: A poor priest with two tiny benefices totaling 20 florins/year isn't the problem\n\nCon: Creates accounting nightmare; rich benefices will be undervalued\n\n\n\nMY RECOMMENDATIONS (Given Roll 91 and Como Declaration)\n\nIssue\nRecommendation\nRationale\nGrandfathering\nOption B (existing honored for life, but not renewable)\nComo said grandfather, but decree still achieves reform\nScope\nMajor benefices + cure of souls strictly limited; minor benefices limited to 2-3\nFocus on what matters: pastoral care\nDispensations\nOption B (strict limits, granted by ordinary not Rome)\nCloses the loophole\nExemptions\nCardinals addressed carefully; professors get limited exemption; no royal chaplain exemption\nBasel was anti-curial; professors serve the Church\nIncompatibility\nYes, explicitly address\nMakes enforcement easier\nEnforcement\nAutomatic vacancy + penalties for conferrers + oversight commission reporting\nSame enforcement structure as concubinage decree\nIncome threshold\nYes, allow poor benefices under 10 florins to be combined\nPragmatic mercy\n\n\nGiven that Juan is not present and the Castilian delegation follows the Como principles (grandfather existing, reform going forward), shall I proceed with drafting the decree along these lines?"

Let me summarize the key points:\n\n**What annates were:**\n1. **Servitia communia** - One year's revenue paid by bishops and abbots on induction (divided between cardinals and papal treasury)\n2. **Servitia minuta** - Additional notarial fees to curial officials\n3. **Annata proper** - Half the first year's income paid on minor benefices collated by the pope\n4. **Quindennia** - Payments every 15 years by benefices permanently united to corporations\n\n**Historical context:**\n- John XXII (1316-34) fixed annates at half the annual revenue\n- Concordat of Constance (1418) set minimum threshold at 24 gold florins\n- Basel (1435) wanted to abolish annates entirely, but this was too radical\n- The Vienna Concordat (1448) restored servitia\n\n**The Como Declaration specified:** \"annates cap (one-quarter first year's revenue, Camera Apostolica transparency, right of appeal)\"\n\nSo our alternate timeline decree should:\n1. **Cap annates at 25% (one-quarter)** instead of the existing 50%\n2. **Require Camera Apostolica transparency** - publish accounts, show where money goes\n3. **Grant right of appeal** for those who feel they've been overcharged\n\nThis is a moderate reform - not abolishing annates entirely (which Basel did in 1435 but which was unrealistic), but reducing them and adding accountability. This fits with the Como Declaration's moderate approach: grandfather existing, reform going forward, but don't destroy the papacy.\n\nLet me proceed with drafting this decree.\n\n\nNow I have excellent research on annates. Let me proceed with drafting the decree.\n\n\n\nKEY ISSUES FOR THE ANNATES REFORM DECREE\n\n\nWhat Annates Were (1433)\n\n\nThe term \"annates\" covered several types of papal taxation:\n\n\nServitia communia - One full year's revenue paid by bishops and abbots upon confirmation (split between cardinals and papal treasury)\n\nServitia minuta - Additional fees to curial officials\n\nAnnata proper - Half the first year's income from minor benefices collated by the pope\n\nQuindennia - Payments every 15 years from permanently united benefices\n\n\nHistorical rates: John XXII (1316-34) fixed annates at half (50%) the annual revenue. The Concordat of Constance (1418) set a minimum threshold of 24 gold florins.\n\n\nThe Political Problem\n\n\nIn the standard timeline, Basel's June 1435 decree abolished annates entirely and provided no replacement revenue. This was financially catastrophic for the papacy and contributed to the breakdown of papal-conciliar relations.\n\n\nThe Como Declaration (from our roll 91 outcome) specified: \"annates cap (one-quarter first year's revenue, Camera Apostolica transparency, right of appeal)\"\n\n\nThis is a moderate reform: reduce the burden, add accountability, but don't bankrupt the papacy.\n\n\n\nLet me now draft the decree:\n\n\nCreate File: Creating the Council of Basel Session 17 Decree on the Reform of Annates, following the same bilingual Latin/English format as the previous decrees\n\n\nThought process\n\nNow I need to copy it to the outputs folder for the user to access.\n\n\nBash Tool: Copying the completed annates reform decree to outputs folder\n\n\nThought process: Finalized decree framework and prepared comprehensive summary.\n\nThe decree is complete. Let me provide a summary for the user.\n\n\nView the Decree on Annates Reform\n\n\n\nSession 17 Decree Summary (October 19, 1433):\n\n\nThis decree represents the \"middle way\" the Como Declaration envisioned—genuine reform without destroying papal finances.\n\n\nNine Articles:\n\n\nReduction of Servitia Communia — From 100% to 25% of first year's income. Poor prelates can petition their metropolitan for further reduction to 12.5% or total remission.\n\nReduction of Annates Proper — From 50% to 25%. Benefices under 24 florins exempt (Constance threshold preserved). Benefices 24-50 florins pay flat 10 florins.\n\nAbolition of Servitia Minuta — Tips and gratuities to curial officials eliminated. Officials to receive fixed salaries instead. Public tables posted with exact fees for bulls and letters.\n\nNew Valuation System — Provincial synods to conduct new valuations within five years, replacing ancient inflated assessments. Based on ten-year average income less ordinary burdens.\n\nCamera Apostolica Transparency — Annual accounts published showing all receipts and expenditures. Quarterly notices of collections. Commission can suspend annates collection if accounts not rendered.\n\nRight of Appeal — Three-tier system: (1) Auditor of Camera (30 days), (2) Supervisory Commission (final), (3) No forced renunciation of appeal rights. Pending appeal, only uncontested portion must be paid.\n\nPayment Terms — Servitia payable in two installments (6 months, 12 months). Extensions up to two years available. No usury on delayed payments.\n\nQuindennia Reform — Only apply to benefices united by apostolic authority exceeding 50 florins. Rate reduced to 10% (from 25%). Charitable unions exempt.\n\nEnforcement — Supervisory commission (same body as concubinage/pluralism decrees) oversees compliance. Can warn Camera, suspend collection in provinces, or refer to synod/pope.\n\n\n\nWhy This Differs from Historical Basel\n\n\nThe historical Basel decree (June 1435) abolished annates entirely and offered no replacement revenue. This was:\n\n\nFinancially catastrophic for the papacy\n\nPolitically naive (gave Pope no reason to cooperate)\n\nA major factor in the schism that followed\n\n\nThe Como Declaration specified reform, not abolition. This alternate decree:\n\n\nCuts rates by 75% (substantial relief)\n\nPreserves papal revenue stream (just smaller)\n\nAdds accountability (transparency, appeals)\n\nCreates enforcement mechanism\n\nOffers something Pope Eugenius IV might actually accept\n\n\n\nRemaining Basel Decrees\n\n\nElectoral Reform Decree (Session 12) — Already in project files\n\nDecree on Clerical Concubinage (Session 15) — Complete\n\nDecree on Pluralism (Session 16) — Complete\n\nDecree on Annates Reform (Session 17) — Just completed\n\nCompacts of Basel (November 1433) — Bohemian reconciliation — Next\n\nCrusade Decree for Constantinople (Session 19, December 1433)\n\n\nShall I proceed to the Compacts of Basel (the Bohemian reconciliation) or the Crusade Decree?"

The document would be the agreement of November 30, 1433 in Prague.\n\n\nI'll begin drafting the document, carefully incorporating the nuanced agreements reached during the Basel negotiations. I'll ensure each article reflects the delicate compromise between Hussite demands and Catholic requirements.\n\n\nNow I have excellent research on the Compacts.

It represents one of the most remarkable diplomatic achievements of the medieval church - reconciling with a heretical movement that had defeated five crusades.\n\nLet me give Sicco a summary of what this document contains.\n\n\nView the Compacts of Basel\n\n\n\nThe Compacts of Basel - Summary (November 30, 1433)\n\n\nThis is a fundamentally different kind of document from the previous reform decrees. It's not a unilateral council declaration but a bilateral treaty—a negotiated peace between the Council of Basel and the Kingdom of Bohemia after thirty-five years of religious war.\n\n\nThe Structure\n\n\nUnlike the reform decrees, the Compacts have:\n\n\nPreamble - Both parties named as contracting equals\n\nFour Articles - Addressing each of the Four Articles of Prague (1420)\n\nGeneral Provisions - Peace, reconciliation, the Archbishop question, the Taborite problem\n\nDual Signatures - Both Council legates AND Bohemian orators sign\n\nImperial Acceptance - Sigismund's oath to observe the Compacts\n\nSynodal Confirmation - Basel's formal ratification\n\n\nThe Four Articles Resolved\n\nArticle\nHussite Demand\nCompact Solution\nCommunion\nWine for laity\nGranted in Bohemia/Moravia only; doctrine of concomitance affirmed (whole Christ in each species)\nFree Preaching\nNo restrictions\nGranted, but preachers must be ordained and approved by ordinaries\nClerical Poverty\nNo secular possessions\nCompromise: clergy can't be secular judges or bear arms, but Church can hold property\nPunishment of Sin\nPublic sins publicly punished\nDistinguished between ecclesiastical and civil jurisdiction; both have roles\n\nKey Provisions\n\n\nPeace and Amnesty - All excommunications revoked; all past injuries forgiven\n\nJohn Hus's Memory - Not publicly condemned in Bohemia; judgment on his doctrines \"suspended\"\n\nArchbishop of Prague - Election to proceed; Jan Rokycana proposed (historically never confirmed by Rome)\n\nTaborites - Not forced to accept; left to \"judgment of God\"; no more crusades\n\nChurch Property - Already-secularized lands not reclaimed if pensions paid\n\n\nHistorical Significance\n\n\nThis document ended the Hussite Wars (1419-1434), which had seen:\n\n\nFive failed crusades against Bohemia\n\n100,000+ deaths\n\nDevastating raids into Germany, Austria, Silesia\n\nThe complete humiliation of Catholic military power\n\n\nThe Compacts prove that dialogue can achieve what crusades could not. For Juan II, arriving in Rome just as news of this breakthrough reaches Italy, it's powerful evidence for his argument that the Council and Pope should cooperate rather than fight.\n\n\nWhat Made This Possible (Roll 91)\n\n\nIn the alternate timeline, the Imperial-Castilian alliance and Como Declaration created momentum for genuine reconciliation rather than continued confrontation. Emperor Sigismund's presence at Basel from July 1433 and his coordination with the Castilian delegation helped bridge the gap between Council hardliners and Bohemian negotiators.\n\n\n\nRemaining Basel Documents\n\n\nElectoral Reform Decree (Session 12) — Already in project files\n\nDecree on Clerical Concubinage (Session 15) — Complete\n\nDecree on Pluralism (Session 16) — Complete\n\nDecree on Annates Reform (Session 17) — Complete\n\nCompacts of Basel (November 1433) — Just completed\n\nCrusade Decree for Constantinople (Session 19, December 1433) — Final one!\n\n\nShall I proceed to the Crusade Decree for Constantinople?

They want to understand what happened in 1462 when Pope Pius II annulled the Compacts.\n\nThis is historically accurate - in 1462, Pope Pius II (who was Enea Silvio Piccolomini, interestingly a former secretary at the Council of Basel who had switched sides to support the papacy) did indeed unilaterally declare the Compacts of Basel null and void. This was a major betrayal of the agreement that had ended the Hussite Wars.\n\nThe user is asking me to explain this - probably because:\n1. It's an important historical detail they want to understand\n2. It might affect how they think about the Compacts in the alternate timeline\n3. They might be questioning whether this should be in a document set in 1433\n\nLet me explain the historical context clearly.\n\n\nThat's a reference to what happened in the standard historical timeline about thirty years after the Compacts were signed.\n\n\nThe Betrayal of 1462:\n\n\nPope Pius II (Enea Silvio Piccolomini—ironically, a man who had served as a secretary at the Council of Basel itself before switching to the papal side) declared the Compacts null and void in 1462. He demanded that King George of Poděbrady, the Hussite king of Bohemia, abandon communion in both kinds and return to full Roman obedience.\n\n\nWhen George refused, Pius II excommunicated him (1466), and his successor Paul II called yet another crusade against Bohemia—this time led by Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, who invaded and seized Moravia.\n\n\nThe Bohemians were understandably outraged. They had negotiated in good faith, accepted a compromise that gave the Church most of what it wanted doctrinally (affirming concomitance, accepting episcopal oversight of preachers), and kept their end of the bargain for nearly thirty years. Then Rome unilaterally tore up the agreement.\n\n\nWhy the Papacy Did This:\n\n\nThe Compacts had been negotiated by the Council of Basel, not by the Pope. Eugenius IV never formally ratified them—he tolerated them as a fait accompli but never gave them papal approval. Later popes felt no obligation to honor an agreement made by a council they considered to have exceeded its authority.\n\n\nWhy I Included It:\n\n\nI included it as historical context so you'd understand:\n\n\nThe Compacts' ultimate fate in the real timeline\n\nWhy papal ratification (or lack thereof) matters\n\nThe fragility of conciliar agreements without papal buy-in\n\n\nFor the Alternate Timeline:\n\n\nThis is precisely why Juan's \"parallel legislation\" proposal matters. If Eugenius IV can be persuaded to co-sign or formally ratify the Compacts (and the other Basel reforms), they become papal legislation, not just conciliar—much harder for future popes to repudiate.\n\n\nShould I remove that line from the document since it references events far beyond 1433? Or would you prefer to keep it as out-of-universe historical context for your reference?"

This is smart - this is a significant document that will have real gameplay implications for Juan's Constantinople expedition. Let me think through what issues need to be addressed and what decisions/rolls might be needed.\n\nThe Crusade Decree (Session 19, December 1433) in our alternate timeline would be the formal call from the Council of Basel for Christian princes to aid Constantinople against the Ottoman threat.\n\nKey issues to consider:\n\n1. **Scope of the Crusade Call**\n- Is this specifically for Constantinople, or a broader anti-Ottoman crusade?\n- Does it include recovering the Holy Land, or just defending the Eastern Empire?\n- How does it relate to the Greek Church (still in schism at this point)?\n\n2. **Who is Called to Participate?**\n- All Christian princes? Specific kingdoms?\n- What obligations does it create?\n- What about Venice, Genoa, and other powers with Ottoman trade interests?\n\n3. **Financing**\n- Crusade tithes? On whom? For how long?\n- Indulgences for crusaders?\n- Who controls the money?\n\n4. **Leadership**\n- Who commands the crusade?\n- Is there a papal legate?\n- What role does Emperor Sigismund play?\n- What role does Juan play?\n\n5. **Indulgences**\n- Plenary indulgence for crusaders?\n- Partial indulgences for contributors?\n- How is this administered?\n\n6. **Coordination with Greeks**\n- The Great Schism is still in effect\n- Will Greeks accept Latin help?\n- What about church union negotiations?\n\n7. **Specific Commitments**\n- The summary mentioned Duke of Burgundy pledged ships, Venice offered naval support, Hungary promised coordination\n- What did other powers commit?\n- What did Castile commit (Juan's 1000 knights)?\n\n8. **Timeline and Staging**\n- When does the crusade launch?\n\n\n- Forces will likely gather at strategic maritime points, potentially Venice or Ragusa, given naval support commitments\n- Strategic plan seems focused on coordinated naval and land approaches to challenge Ottoman expansion\n\nI'll need to determine precise staging locations and coordinate the complex multinational military effort, considering the intricate political and religious dynamics of the time.\n\nSpecific commitment details require deeper investigation:\n- Naval capabilities of Burgundy and Venice\n- Hungary's potential land-based military coordination\n- Potential involvement of other Christian powers\n- Financial and logistical feasibility of mounting a comprehensive anti-Ottoman campaign\n\nThe crusade decree appears to have significant momentum, with key powers already signaling substantive support. Next steps involve mapping out exact troop and ship allocations, funding mechanisms, and strategic deployment routes.\n\n\nExcellent—let's think this through carefully. The Crusade Decree is the most directly relevant document to Juan's mission, and it has real gameplay implications.\n\n\n\nKEY ISSUES FOR THE CRUSADE DECREE\n\n\nIssue 1: Scope and Target\n\n\nWhat exactly is this crusade for?\n\n\nOption A: Constantinople Defense Only\n\n\nNarrowly focused: defend the Byzantine Empire against Ottoman aggression\n\nDoesn't promise to recover lost territory (Thessalonica, Bulgaria, etc.)\n\nEasier to achieve, clearer objectives\n\n\nOption B: Broader Anti-Ottoman Crusade\n\n\nIncludes driving Ottomans from Europe entirely\n\nRecovery of Thessalonica, Serbia, Bulgaria\n\nMuch more ambitious, harder to coordinate\n\n\nOption C: Full Eastern Crusade\n\n\nConstantinople + Holy Land recovery\n\nCompletely unrealistic given resources, but maximally inspiring language\n\n\nThe Roll 91 outcome mentioned \"Ottoman threat named explicitly, Constantinople's peril acknowledged\"—this suggests Option A or B, not the fantastical Option C.\n\n\n\nIssue 2: The Greek Schism Problem\n\n\nThe Orthodox Church has been in schism with Rome since 1054. Emperor John VIII Palaiologos desperately needs Western help, but:\n\n\nGreeks remember the Fourth Crusade (1204) when crusaders sacked Constantinople\n\nGreek clergy and population are hostile to Latin \"help\"\n\nChurch union is the price the Pope demands for aid\n\n\nHow does the decree handle this?\n\n\nDoes it demand Greek acceptance of union before aid comes?\n\nDoes it offer aid unconditionally as Christian charity?\n\nDoes it defer the union question to future negotiation?\n\n\nThis matters because Juan is about to show up in Constantinople with 600 knights. How he's received depends partly on what the decree says about the union question.\n\n\n\nIssue 3: Who Commits What?\n\n\nThe Roll 91 summary mentioned:\n\n\nDuke of Burgundy pledged ships\n\nVenice offered naval support\n\nHungary promised coordination\n\nCastile (implied) - Juan's 1000 knights (now ~625 after losses)\n\n\nBut what about:\n\n\nAragon - Alfonso V is in Naples; what does he commit?\n\nFrance - Still fighting England; probably nothing?\n\nEngland - Hundred Years' War; probably nothing?\n\nGenoa - Major Mediterranean naval power; what do they say?\n\nPoland-Lithuania - Facing their own Teutonic/Mongol problems\n\nGerman Princes - Sigismund's vassals; what can he extract from them?\n\nPope Eugenius IV - Papal treasury contribution? Papal galleys?\n\nKnights of Rhodes (Hospitallers) - Already fighting Ottomans\n\n\nDo we need rolls to determine specific commitments?\n\n\n\nIssue 4: Crusade Financing\n\n\nMedieval crusades were expensive. How is this one funded?\n\n\nPossible mechanisms:\n\n\nCrusade tithe - Tax on all clergy (1/10 of income for X years)\n\nIndulgences - Plenary indulgence for crusaders, partial for contributors\n\nPapal treasury contribution - Direct funding from Camera Apostolica\n\nRoyal contributions - Each king funds their own contingent\n\nVenetian/Genoese loans - Banking arrangements\n\n\nThe Annates Reform Decree we just wrote reduced papal revenues by 75%. Can the Pope afford to contribute to a crusade?\n\n\n\nIssue 5: Command Structure\n\n\nWho leads this crusade?\n\n\nPapal Legate - Traditional for crusades; who is appointed?\n\nEmperor Sigismund - Nominal leader of Christendom, but he's old (65) and tied down in Germany\n\nKing Juan II - Already en route with the largest single contingent\n\nByzantine Emperor John VIII - It's his empire being defended\n\nA Military Commander - Someone appointed specifically for the task\n\n\nThis has direct implications for Juan's authority when he arrives in Constantinople.\n\n\n\nIssue 6: Timeline\n\n\nWhen is the crusade supposed to happen?\n\n\nThe decree is December 1433\n\nJuan is already en route (left Barcelona March 1434)\n\nHow long do other powers have to mobilize?\n\nWhen are forces supposed to arrive at Constantinople?\n\nIs there a staging point (Rhodes? Crete? Venice?)\n\n\n\nSUGGESTED ROLLS\n\n\nGiven that Roll 91 already established the decree passed with \"extraordinary support,\" I'd suggest:\n\n\nRoll 1: Specificity of Commitments\n\n\nHow concrete are the promises made?\n\nVague expressions of support vs. specific numbers of ships/men/florins?\n\nAffects whether Juan has real allies coming or just words\n\n\nRoll 2: Command Authority\n\n\nDoes the decree give Juan any special status?\n\nOr is he just one prince among many?\n\nAffects his authority when dealing with Greeks, Venetians, etc.\n\n\nRoll 3: Financing Success\n\n\nHow much money is actually raised?\n\nAffects whether reinforcements and supplies actually arrive\n\n\n\nWhat aspects would you like to explore further? And which of these issues might need dice to resolve?"

      "say": "Thought process: Excavated Juan's Basel instructions and weighed scope options against historical realism.\n\nThe user wants to understand what instructions Juan left at Basel before departing, and then make rolls for each of the 6 issues related to the Crusade Decree. They're correctly pointing out that Roll 91 only affects Basel's internal process - not how other nations respond.\n\nFrom the search results, I found key information about Juan's instructions at Basel:\n\n1. **Juan proposed three principles for Council's crusade authorization:**\n   - **Unified Military Command** - Juan offered himself as commander based on Granada record, but would submit to another if Council deemed them more worthy\n   - **Confession and Spiritual Standards** - crusaders must enter after genuine confession, no joining for wrong reasons\n   - **Financial Transparency** - strict accounting standards from Granada crusade\n\n2. **Juan's specific instructions:**\n   - He proposed that Pope and Council agree on identical crusade text beforehand (parallel legislation)\n   - He left with the Castilian delegation (Abbott Rodrigo, Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena, Fray Hernando) to continue advocacy\n   - Germans acknowledged unified command necessity but warned of political questions\n\n3. **The Roll 19 result:** This was about the PARALLEL LEGISLATION attempt failing - the Council couldn't pass a decree in coordination with the Pope. But now we're in a different timeline - the Roll 91 came later (after Como Declaration, after the reforms passed). This suggests the Council DID eventually pass a crusade decree in December 1433.\n\nSo the question for Issue 1 (Scope and Target) is: What scope did the Basel decree take?\n\nJuan's instructions were about:\n- Constantinople defense (he committed 1,000 knights and 60,000 florins specifically for wall repairs)\n- Unified command structure\n- Spiritual standards\n- Financial transparency\n\nHe did NOT specify whether the scope should be narrow (Constantinople defense only) or broad (drive Ottomans from Europe).\n\nGiven:\n- Roll 91 was about Basel's internal process succeeding\n- The Como Declaration and Reform decrees had passed\n\n\n- German cardinals were energized, but Juan wasn't there to personally advocate\n\nI see the Council is wrestling with two potential approaches. The German contingent seems more ambitious, potentially wanting a broader campaign to push the Ottomans out of Europe entirely. Juan's original instructions were laser-focused on Constantinople's immediate defense. Without his direct advocacy, the scope might expand beyond his initial narrow vision. The historical context suggests the Council will likely seek a compromise - protecting Constantinople while leaving room for future expansive actions.\n\nThe competing national interests create fascinating diplomatic tension. Each delegation wants language that serves their strategic objectives. Byzantines need concrete defense guarantees, Hungarians want broader territorial recovery, Venetians seek commercial protections, and the French prefer diplomatic flexibility. The procedural dynamics of the Basel Council naturally push toward generalized, non-committal language that can satisfy multiple stakeholders.\n\nA dice roll will elegantly resolve this strategic ambiguity, introducing genuine uncertainty into the document's final framing.\n\n\nLet me search for more specific details about Juan's Basel instructions.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Reconstructed Juan's instructions and identified scope ambiguity requiring resolution.\n\nNow I have a clearer picture. Let me summarize what Juan left behind as instructions:\n\n**Juan's Basel Instructions (May-June 1433):**\n\n1. **Constantinople-specific focus**: 1,000 knights, 60,000 florins for wall repairs, 17 crusaders as advance party\n2. **Three principles for crusade authorization:**\n   - Unified Military Command (Juan offered himself as commander)\n   - Confession and Spiritual Standards\n   - Financial Transparency\n3. **Parallel Legislation Strategy** - Pope and Council agree on identical text\n\n**Critical Development - Roll 19 vs Roll 91:**\n- Roll 19 (June 1433): Council's procedural machinery failed to pass crusade decree in meaningful timeline\n- This was BEFORE the Declaration of Como and the reform success\n- Roll 91 came AFTER Como Declaration (June 1433) and the reform decrees (September-October 1433)\n- The changed political landscape (Emperor Sigismund at Basel, reforms passing, Como unity) created conditions for the Council to finally act\n\nSo by December 1433, Basel DID pass a crusade decree (Roll 91 says \"Crusade decree passed with extraordinary support\"). The question is: what exactly did that decree say?\n\n**Issue 1: Scope and Target**\n\nJuan's original instructions focused specifically on Constantinople defense - wall repairs, defending against Ottoman siege. He wasn't thinking about broader anti-Ottoman operations.\n\nHowever, Basel's tendency would be toward broader language:\n- Grander rhetoric inspires more participation\n- Various national interests (Hungary wants Serbian recovery, Venice wants Thessalonica)\n- Crusade bulls historically use sweeping language\n- Council fathers love grandiose declarations\n\nBut also factors for narrow scope:\n- Juan's concrete commitment was for Constantinople specifically\n- Byzantine delegation asked for Constantinople defense\n- More achievable = more credible\n- After years of paralysis, Council might be practical\n\nThis genuinely could go either way. The user is right that we need a roll.\n\n\nI'll prepare the roll to determine the precise scope of the crusade decree, carefully considering the competing pressures between specific defense and broader strategic objectives.\n\n\nExcellent - now I have a clear picture. Let me synthesize what Juan actually left behind as instructions.\n\n\n\nJUAN'S BASEL INSTRUCTIONS (Late May - Early June 1433)\n\n\nConcrete Commitments Made:\n\n\n1,000 Military Order knights to Constantinople\n\n60,000 florins specifically for wall repairs\n\n17 crusaders sent ahead as advance party\n\nEngineers and experts for construction\n\n\nThree Principles Proposed for Crusade Authorization:\n\n\nUnified Military Command\n\n\n\"Every crusade that failed did so partly because competing lords sought glory instead of victory\"\n\nJuan offered himself as commander based on Granada record\n\n\"Would submit to another if Council deemed them more worthy\"\n\nByzantines made clear: Emperor John will not accept divided command\n\nConfession and Spiritual Standards\n\n\n\"Crusade cannot be vehicle for rapists and murderers seeking absolution\"\n\nGenuine confession required\n\nSpiritual guidance integral (Granada model)\n\nFinancial Transparency\n\n\nStrict accounting standards\n\nOversight committee similar to Granada model\n\n\nReception at Basel (May 1433):\n\n\nGermans: acknowledged unified command necessity but warned of political questions (\"French will ask why Castilian not French prince\")\n\nConfession requirements: noted as unusual but effective in Granada\n\nFinancial transparency: strong immediate agreement\n\n\n\nKey Timeline Note:\n\n\nRoll 19 (procedural death) was in June 1433 - BEFORE Como Declaration, BEFORE reforms passed.\n\n\nRoll 91 (extraordinary support) came in December 1433 - AFTER Como, AFTER Emperor Sigismund arrived, AFTER reform decrees passed. The political landscape had transformed.\n\n\nSo Juan's instructions were still there, but filtered through six months of changed circumstances.\n\n\n\nISSUE 1: SCOPE AND TARGET\n\n\nThe Question: How broad is the crusade decree's scope?\n\n\nOption A: Constantinople Defense Only (narrow, achievable)\n\n\nFocus on immediate wall repair and military defense\n\nSpecific, concrete, measurable\n\n\nOption B: Broader Anti-Ottoman Crusade (drive Ottomans from Europe, recover lost territories)\n\n\nInclude Thessalonica, Serbia, Bulgaria\n\nMore inspiring but less focused\n\n\nOption C: Full Eastern Crusade Including Holy Land (maximalist)\n\n\nTraditional crusade rhetoric\n\nCompletely unrealistic but historically what councils often proclaimed\n\n\n\nFACTORS PUSHING TOWARD NARROW SCOPE (Option A):\n\n\nJuan's concrete commitment was Constantinople-specific (wall repairs, 60,000 florins)\n\nByzantine delegation asked specifically for Constantinople defense\n\nAchievable goals = credible decree\n\nAfter years of paralysis, Council might embrace practicality\n\nCardinal Cesarini wanted something that could actually happen\n\nEmperor Sigismund (now at Basel) focused on Hungarian frontier, understands concrete needs\n\n\nFACTORS PUSHING TOWARD BROADER SCOPE (Option B/C):\n\n\nCrusade rhetoric historically grandiose\n\nCouncil fathers love sweeping declarations\n\nVarious national interests: Hungary wants Serbian recovery, Venice wants Thessalonica\n\nGrander vision inspires more donations and participation\n\nFrench faction might push broader language (costs them nothing, commits no one)\n\nCrusade tradition includes the Holy Land - some will insist on mentioning it\n\n\n\nWHAT ROLL DETERMINES:\n\n\nThis isn't about \"success vs. failure\" - the decree passes either way (Roll 91 already established that). This is about how Basel's deliberative process shaped the final text given competing pressures.\n\nRoll Range\nOutcome\n1-15\nOption C: Maximalist Holy Land rhetoric. Sweeping language about recovering Jerusalem, driving infidels from all Christian lands. Sounds magnificent, commits to nothing practical. Juan's specific Constantinople focus buried under traditional crusade boilerplate.\n16-40\nOption B (broad): Anti-Ottoman crusade with Constantinople as priority but broader goals included. Mentions recovering \"territories unjustly seized\" - Thessalonica, Serbia, etc. Dilutes Constantinople urgency with wider ambitions.\n41-70\nMixed: Constantinople explicitly named as primary objective, but decree includes aspirational language about \"future recovery\" of other territories. Practical focus with rhetorical nod to broader vision.\n71-90\nOption A (focused): Constantinople defense as central, specific objective. Other territories mentioned only in context of Ottoman threat. Juan's wall-repair/defense framing dominates. Practical and achievable.\n91-100\nOption A with teeth: Not only Constantinople-focused, but includes specific mechanisms - timelines, coordination points, staging logistics.

Unusually concrete for ecclesiastical decree. German pragmatism prevails.\"\n\nA natural 100 takes this even further. This is the most focused, practical, concrete crusade decree imaginable from a medieval ecclesiastical body. \n\nWhat does this look like?\n\n1. Constantinople defense explicitly named as THE objective - not \"among\" objectives\n2. Specific mechanisms included:\n   - Timeline for mobilization\n   - Staging points (likely Rhodes, Venice, or Crete)\n   - Coordination requirements\n   - Wall repair specifically mentioned (Juan's focus)\n3. German pragmatism dominates - after Sigismund's arrival and Como Declaration, the German faction is ascendant\n4. Juan's three principles likely get incorporated:\n   - Unified command structure addressed\n   - Financial transparency/accountability\n   - Spiritual standards for crusaders\n5. Ottoman threat named explicitly (not just vague \"infidel\")\n6.

Emperor John VIII needs help but:\n- Greeks remember Fourth Crusade (1204)\n- Greek clergy/population hostile to Latin \"help\"\n- Church union is the price Pope typically demands\n\nThe question is: does the decree demand union as precondition, offer aid unconditionally, or defer the question?\n\nLet me set up Issue 2.\n\n\nA natural 100. Extraordinary.\n\n\n\nISSUE 1 RESULT: UNPRECEDENTED SPECIFICITY\n\n\nThe crusade decree emerges from Basel's deliberations with a level of concrete operational detail almost unheard of in ecclesiastical legislation. German pragmatism, Emperor Sigismund's personal influence, and the momentum from Como create a decree that reads less like traditional crusade rhetoric and more like a military coordination document.\n\n\nWhat Roll 100 Produces:\n\n\nConstantinople explicitly named as THE objective - not \"among\" objectives, not buried in broader language\n\nWall repair and defense specifically mentioned - Juan's 60,000 florins framing adopted\n\nOttoman threat named directly - Sultan Murad II, not vague \"infidel\" or \"Saracen\"\n\nTimeline included - forces to assemble by specific date (likely spring/summer 1434)\n\nStaging coordination - Venice and Rhodes identified as staging points\n\nJuan's three principles partially incorporated:\nUnified command structure addressed (though details may vary - Issue 5)\n\nFinancial accountability mechanisms referenced\n\nSpiritual preparation for crusaders emphasized\n\nCoordination with Emperor John VIII explicitly required - no unilateral Western action\n\n\nThis is the decree Juan hoped for when he left Basel. The procedural death of June (Roll 19) was reversed by Como's transformation of the political landscape.\n\n\n\nISSUE 2: THE GREEK SCHISM PROBLEM\n\n\nThis is the most theologically fraught question.\n\n\nBackground:\n\n\nOrthodox Church in schism since 1054\n\nEmperor John VIII desperately needs Western military help\n\nBUT Greek clergy and population deeply hostile to Latin Christianity\n\nFourth Crusade (1204) sacked Constantinople - Greeks remember\n\nTraditional papal position: Church union is the price for aid\n\nCouncil of Florence (historically 1439) will attempt formal union\n\n\nThe Question: How does the decree address the schism?\n\n\nOption A: Demand Union as Precondition\n\n\nTraditional papal/Latin position\n\n\"Aid contingent on Greeks accepting filioque, papal supremacy, etc.\"\n\nTheologically satisfying to many Latin fathers\n\nWould make decree functionally worthless - Greeks will refuse\n\nEmperor John might accept but Greek clergy/population will revolt\n\n\nOption B: Unconditional Christian Charity\n\n\nAid offered because Constantinople is Christian, regardless of theological differences\n\n\"We do not abandon fellow Christians to the infidel\"\n\nTheologically controversial - appears to legitimize schism\n\nPractically necessary if aid is to be accepted\n\nJuan's position at Basel leaned this direction\n\n\nOption C: Defer to Future Negotiation\n\n\nAid offered now, union discussions continue separately\n\n\"Present emergency requires immediate action; theological questions addressed through proper dialogue\"\n\nDiplomatic middle ground\n\nNeither demands union nor abandons it\n\nAllows both sides to save face\n\n\n\nFACTORS FAVORING OPTION A (Demand Union):\n\n\nStrong contingent at Basel wants theological victory\n\nPope Eugenius IV traditionally insists on union\n\nMany Latin clergy see schism as the real problem\n\n\"Why save people who reject true Church?\"\n\n\nFACTORS FAVORING OPTION B (Unconditional):\n\n\nJuan's concrete commitment came without theological preconditions\n\nByzantine metropolitans (Bessarion, Isidore) emphasized practical need\n\nGerman faction focused on Ottoman threat, not theology\n\nCardinal Cesarini wants action, not more debate\n\nComo Declaration emphasized practical cooperation\n\n\nFACTORS FAVORING OPTION C (Defer):\n\n\nClassic compromise position\n\nAllows decree to pass with broad support\n\nNeither faction gets everything, neither loses everything\n\nEcclesiastical bodies love deferred questions\n\n\n\nWHAT THIS ROLL DETERMINES:\n\n\nHow did Basel's theological factions resolve this tension in the final decree language?\n\nRoll Range\nOutcome\n1-20\nOption A dominates: Decree includes language making aid contingent on \"return to unity\" or \"acknowledgment of Roman primacy.\" Practically cripples the crusade before it begins. Greeks will reject.\n21-45\nOption A softened: Union strongly encouraged but not explicitly required. Loaded language about \"healing the wound of schism\" that Greeks will find insulting. Problematic but not fatal.\n46-65\nOption C: Classic deferral. Aid offered, union discussions \"to continue through appropriate channels.\" Diplomatic language that commits to nothing. Both sides can interpret as they wish.\n66-85\nOption C with warmth: Deferral plus genuinely charitable language about Eastern Christians as brothers. Acknowledges shared faith, defers theological differences. Greeks will receive positively.\n86-100\nOption B: Unconditional Christian solidarity. \"The defense of Christian Constantinople against Ottoman conquest requires no theological precondition.\" Remarkable statement that prioritizes action over doctrine.\n\n\nReady for your roll on Issue 2: Greek Schism Problem."

      "say": "Thought process: Reconsidered logical constraints of prior unconditional commitment.\n\nThe user makes an excellent point. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nJuan already committed 1,000 knights and 60,000 florins to Constantinople with NO theological preconditions. This was done in May/June 1433, before Como, before the reforms, before Roll 91.\n\nThe crusade decree is being drafted in December 1433. By this point:\n1. Juan's unconditional commitment is already known\n2. The seventeen crusaders have already traveled to Constantinople with the Byzantine delegation\n3. Juan himself is en route to Constantinople with ~600 knights\n\nSo if the Basel decree suddenly attaches theological preconditions (union demands), it creates a bizarre situation:\n- Castilian aid (the largest concrete commitment) was given unconditionally\n- Decree retroactively tries to attach conditions that Juan never agreed to\n- This would either:\n  a) Make the decree irrelevant to what's actually happening (Juan's expedition proceeds regardless)\n  b) Create conflict between Juan and the Council\n  c) Undermine the whole \"parallel legislation\" concept\n\nThe Council can't really demand union as a precondition when the primary military force is already committed and en route WITHOUT that precondition.\n\nMoreover, Roll 91 said the decree passed with \"extraordinary support\" - this suggests the decree was well-received and unified people. A decree that contradicted the terms of the largest actual commitment would be divisive, not unifying.\n\nAlso, the German faction and Emperor Sigismund (who shaped Como) are pragmatists focused on the Ottoman threat. They wouldn't want theological preconditions that doom the practical mission.\n\nSo the user is right - the probability table I created doesn't properly account for the fact that Juan's unconditional commitment has already set the terms. The Council can't really walk that back.\n\nLet me reconsider what Issue 2 actually means in this context.\n\nThe question becomes narrower: Given that Juan's commitment is unconditional, how does the Council frame the decree regarding the schism question FOR OTHER POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS?\n\n\nI see three potential strategic approaches for the Council. They must carefully navigate Juan's precedent while potentially addressing the schism with other potential participants. The decree's language could significantly impact future recruitment and Byzantine perceptions. \n\nThe key challenge is balancing theological objectives with practical military mobilization. Each option carries different diplomatic and strategic implications for engaging other Christian princes and the Byzantine leadership.\n\nThe critical questions center on how conditional terms might undermine broader crusade participation and Greek receptiveness to Western military support.\n\n\nYou're absolutely right. I didn't think this through properly.\n\n\nThe Established Facts:\n\n\nJuan committed 1,000 knights and 60,000 florins in May 1433 - unconditionally\n\nByzantine Metropolitans Bessarion and Isidore received this commitment with emotional gratitude precisely BECAUSE it had no strings\n\nSeventeen crusaders already traveled to Constantinople (arrived ~August 1433)\n\nJuan is currently en route with ~600 knights - already past the point of recall\n\nThis unconditional commitment was made publicly, witnessed by Cardinal Cesarini, German cardinals, and the Byzantine delegation\n\n\nThe Logical Problem:\n\n\nIf the December 1433 decree suddenly attaches union demands, it creates an absurdity:\n\n\nThe largest concrete military commitment (Castile) was given unconditionally\n\nThe decree can't retroactively impose conditions Juan never agreed to\n\nJuan's forces arrive regardless of what Basel says about union\n\nAny union language would only apply to hypothetical future contributors - not the actual expedition\n\n\nWhat Roll 91 Already Implies:\n\n\n\"Extraordinary support\" suggests the decree was unifying, not divisive. A decree that contradicted the terms of the primary military commitment would have been contested, not celebrated.\n\n\n\nRevised Question for Issue 2:\n\n\nThe real question isn't whether the decree demands union (that would be self-defeating). The question is: How does the decree frame the relationship with Orthodox Christianity?\n\n\nDoes it follow Juan's model and explicitly state no preconditions?\n\nDoes it use diplomatic silence (simply not mention the schism)?\n\nDoes it include aspirational language about \"future dialogue\" without conditions?\n\nDoes it go further and make a positive statement about Eastern Christians as brothers?\n\n\nThis affects Greek reception of the overall crusade call - their willingness to welcome reinforcements beyond Juan's forces, their cooperation with staging through Venice/Rhodes, their attitude toward potential future participants.\n\n\n\nRevised Roll Table:\n\nRoll Range\nOutcome\n1-25\nDiplomatic silence: Decree simply doesn't address the schism. Greeks are \"Christians in peril.\" No mention of union, no mention of brotherhood. Neutral but cold.\n26-50\nAspirational deferral: Brief mention that \"healing of ancient divisions\" is hoped for, but clearly separate from immediate military aid. Standard ecclesiastical hedging.\n51-75\nWarm acknowledgment: Explicit language about Eastern Christians as \"brothers in Christ\" facing common enemy. Schism acknowledged but framed as wound to be healed through charity, not precondition.\n76-100\nJuan's model adopted: Decree explicitly states that defense of Constantinople is Christian duty requiring no theological precondition. Remarkable statement that could influence future East-West relations.\n\nDoes this framing make more sense?"

      "say": "Thought process: Examined diplomatic compromise through strategic ambiguity.\n\nThe user rolled an 18, which falls in the 1-25 range: Diplomatic silence.\n\nThis is actually quite realistic. Ecclesiastical documents often avoid thorny issues by simply not mentioning them. The Council fathers, faced with the tension between:\n- Juan's unconditional commitment already made\n- Traditional Latin insistence on union\n- The need to pass something with \"extraordinary support\" (Roll 91)\n\n...chose the path of least resistance: just don't talk about it.\n\nThis is very typical of compromise documents. When you can't agree on how to address something, you address it by not addressing it.\n\nLet me think through the implications:\n\n1. The decree doesn't demand union (which would be self-defeating)\n2. But it also doesn't make the warm \"brothers in Christ\" statement Juan modeled\n3. Greeks are simply \"Christians in peril\" - factually accurate, emotionally cold\n4. This is... fine? It doesn't help Greek reception but doesn't hurt it either\n5. Juan's personal diplomacy and his advance party's behavior will matter more than the decree's language\n\nThe contrast between Roll 100 (unprecedented specificity on military matters) and Roll 18 (diplomatic silence on theology) is actually quite coherent. The Council excelled at practical planning but punted on the hard theological question. Very Basel.\n\n\nISSUE 2 RESULT: DIPLOMATIC SILENCE\n\n\nThe contrast with Roll 100 is striking - and very Basel.\n\n\nOn military matters: unprecedented specificity, concrete timelines, named objectives.\n\n\nOn the schism: the decree simply... doesn't mention it.\n\n\n\nWhat Roll 18 Produces:\n\n\nThe Council fathers, faced with irreconcilable positions on the Greek question, chose the path of least resistance. The decree refers to Constantinople as a \"Christian city\" and its people as \"Christians in peril.\" Full stop.\n\n\nNo demand for union\n\nNo acknowledgment of brotherhood\n\nNo aspirational language about healing divisions\n\nNo warm charity rhetoric\n\nJust factual neutrality\n\n\nWhy This Happened:\n\n\nThe Latin hardliners who wanted union language couldn't get it past the German pragmatists and Cesarini's faction who wanted an actionable decree. But the hardliners had enough blocking power to prevent any positive statement about Orthodox Christians as \"brothers\" or any explicit rejection of union as precondition.\n\n\nResult: both sides got nothing. The schism is addressed by not being addressed.\n\n\n\nPractical Implications:\n\n\nFor Juan specifically: minimal impact. His personal commitment was unconditional and already known. His advance party is already in Constantinople. His forces arrive based on his word, not Basel's language.\n\n\nFor broader crusade reception: somewhat cold. The decree doesn't insult the Greeks, but it doesn't embrace them either. Future potential contributors receive no guidance on how to approach the Orthodox. Each prince will have to decide for himself whether to attach conditions.\n\n\nFor Greek attitudes toward reinforcements beyond Juan: cautious wariness. The decree doesn't reassure them that the West comes as brothers rather than conquerors. Juan's personal diplomacy and his men's behavior in Constantinople will matter far more than this document.\n\n\n\nSummary So Far:\n\nIssue\nRoll\nResult\n1. Scope & Target\n100\nUnprecedented specificity - Constantinople defense with concrete timelines and logistics\n2. Greek Schism\n18\nDiplomatic silence - neither demands union nor embraces brotherhood\n\n\nISSUE 3: SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS\n\n\nNow we address what other powers actually pledged in the decree itself.\n\n\nImportant Distinction (as you correctly noted):\n\n\nRoll 91 determined how the Council received and passed the decree - extraordinary support, enthusiasm, unity. It did NOT determine what individual kingdoms actually commit. Those are separate sovereign decisions.\n\n\nWhat the Decree Can Include:\n\n\nPledges made BY delegates present at Basel on behalf of their sovereigns\n\nGeneral calls for all Christian princes to contribute\n\nSpecific mechanisms for contribution (crusade tithe, indulgences, etc.)\n\n\nWhat We Need to Determine:\n\n\nWhich powers, if any, made concrete pledges that were incorporated into the decree text itself?\n\n\nPotential Contributors:\n\n\nDuke Philip of Burgundy - Richest prince in Europe, naval capacity, historically crusade-enthusiastic\n\nVenice - Naval superpower, commercial interests in eastern Mediterranean, already fighting Ottomans\n\nHungary (Sigismund's realm) - Frontline state, direct Ottoman pressure, but Sigismund is Emperor now and 65 years old\n\nAragon/Naples (Alfonso V) - Major fleet, but occupied with Italian politics\n\nGenoa - Naval power, commercial rivalry with Venice\n\nKnights of Rhodes/Hospitallers - Already fighting Ottomans, natural participants\n\nPope Eugenius IV - Papal treasury, papal galleys\n\nFrance - Hundred Years' War consuming everything\n\nEngland - Same\n\nPoland-Lithuania - Teutonic Order problems, eastern threats\n\nGerman Princes - Fragmented, Sigismund can't compel them\n\n\n\nWhat This Roll Determines:\n\n\nHow many concrete pledges (beyond Castile's already-made commitment) appear in the decree?\n\nRoll Range\nOutcome\n1-15\nCastile alone: Despite enthusiasm, no other power makes binding pledge in decree. General calls for aid, but Juan's commitment remains the only concrete one.\n16-35\nMinimal: One additional concrete pledge (likely Hospitallers, who are already fighting). Others offer vague support.\n36-55\nModest: 2-3 pledges of varying specificity. Perhaps Hospitallers + Hungary coordination promise + one other.\n56-75\nSolid: 3-4 meaningful pledges. Starts to look like actual coalition forming.\n76-90\nStrong: Multiple concrete commitments. Burgundy ships, Venetian naval support, Hungarian coordination, Hospitaller participation. Real multinational effort taking shape.\n91-100\nExtraordinary: Major coalition with specific numbers, ships, florins named in decree.

Others offer vague support.\"\n\nThis is realistic. Despite the enthusiasm (Roll 91), translating that into binding commitments from sovereign powers is another matter entirely. The Council can pass decrees with great support, but getting kings and dukes to actually pledge men and money is much harder.\n\nLet me think about who would realistically make a concrete pledge:\n\n1. **Knights of Rhodes/Hospitallers** - This is the obvious one. They're already fighting Ottomans. Their entire raison d'être is crusading. They have representatives at Basel. They don't need to consult a sovereign - the Grand Master can commit. This is almost automatic.\n\n2. **Venice** - Possible, but Venice is a republic with complex decision-making. Their delegates at Basel probably couldn't bind the Senate without consultation. Venice has commercial interests that sometimes align with Ottomans. They'd offer \"support\" but probably not a binding commitment in the decree itself.\n\n3. **Burgundy** - Philip the Good is crusade-enthusiastic but cautious. His delegates might offer encouraging words but binding the Duke to specific ships/men without his direct authorization? Unlikely in decree text.\n\n4. **Hungary** - Sigismund IS at Basel (as Emperor). But Hungary's resources are already stretched defending the frontier. He might commit to \"coordination\" but not new forces.\n\n5. **Genoa** - Internal factions, wouldn't commit.\n\n6. **Aragon** - Alfonso V is not at Basel, focused on Naples. His delegates wouldn't bind him.\n\n7. **Papal contribution** - This is Council of Basel, in tension with Pope. They can't commit papal resources.\n\nSo Roll 25 = Hospitallers make concrete pledge, everyone else offers vague support or encouragement.\n\nThis is actually very realistic. Councils produce decrees; sovereigns produce armies. The gap between ecclesiastical enthusiasm and political commitment is historically enormous.\n\n\nISSUE 3 RESULT: CASTILE AND THE HOSPITALLERS\n\n\nThe gap between ecclesiastical enthusiasm and sovereign commitment proves vast.\n\n\n\nWhat Roll 25 Produces:\n\n\nDespite Roll 91's extraordinary support for the decree, translating Council enthusiasm into binding royal pledges is another matter entirely. Delegates can cheer; only sovereigns can commit armies.\n\n\nConcrete Pledges in Decree:\n\n\nCastile (already committed) - 1,000 knights, 60,000 florins, engineers for wall repair\n\nKnights of St. John (Hospitallers) - The one additional binding commitment\n\n\nWhy the Hospitallers:\n\n\nGrand Master Jean de Lastic can commit without consulting a sovereign\n\nRhodes is already on the Ottoman frontier - they're fighting regardless\n\nTheir entire institutional purpose is crusading\n\nRepresentatives at Basel have authority to bind the Order\n\nPledge likely includes: naval support from Rhodes, coordination with Castilian forces, staging facilities\n\n\nEveryone Else:\n\n\nBurgundy: Duke Philip's delegates express warm support, promise to convey the decree to their lord, but make no binding commitment. \"The Duke will surely look favorably upon this holy cause.\"\n\nVenice: Delegates note the Republic's \"traditional concern for Eastern Mediterranean security\" but cannot bind the Senate. Offer to facilitate shipping and staging - commercial opportunity, not military commitment.\n\nHungary: Emperor Sigismund commits to \"coordination\" along the Danube frontier but no new expeditionary forces. Hungary is already stretched thin defending itself.\n\nGenoa: Internal factions prevent any commitment.\n\nAragon: Alfonso V's delegates present but focused on Italian politics. No commitment.\n\nFrance/England: Hundred Years' War consumes everything. Token expressions of pious hope.\n\nGerman Princes: Fragmented. Sigismund cannot compel them. Individual princes might join later, but nothing in decree.\n\nPope: This is a Council decree. They cannot commit papal resources.\n\n\n\nWhat This Means:\n\n\nThe decree that passed with extraordinary support is, in military terms, largely a Castilian expedition with Hospitaller coordination. The impressive specificity (Roll 100) applies to an operation that Juan is essentially leading alone among Western sovereigns.\n\n\nThis is historically realistic. Medieval crusades often began with one committed prince whose example others might follow - or might not. The decree creates the framework for others to join. Whether they actually do depends on events, diplomacy, and self-interest.\n\n\n\nPractical Implications for Juan:\n\n\nHe arrives Constantinople with the only substantial Western force\n\nHospitallers provide naval support and staging from Rhodes - genuinely valuable\n\nNo guaranteed reinforcements behind him\n\nHis 600 knights (591 fit + recovering) are not the vanguard of a great host - they may be the whole Western contribution\n\nHis diplomacy with Emperor John VIII matters enormously - he cannot promise more than he personally controls\n\nFuture recruitment depends on his success, not on Basel's decree\n\n\n\nSummary So Far:\n\nIssue\nRoll\nResult\n1.

The traditional crusade financing model relies heavily on papal coordination of tithes and indulgences. With Basel and Pope in tension, who administers crusade funds?\n\n\nWhat This Roll Determines:\n\nRoll Range\nOutcome\n1-20\nFinancing chaos: Decree calls for contributions but establishes no clear mechanism. Each sovereign funds own contingent. No central coordination.\n21-40\nMinimal structure: Crusade tithe proclaimed but collection left to individual bishops/sovereigns. Indulgences authorized but administration unclear.\n41-60\nParallel systems: Council establishes its own crusade fund separate from papal treasury. Creates jurisdictional confusion but at least provides mechanism.\n61-80\nCoordinated approach: Despite tensions, decree includes financing mechanisms that could work with either papal or conciliar administration. Practical compromise.\n81-100\nRobust system: Clear tithe structure, indulgence framework, designated administrators, accountability mechanisms.

This falls in the 61-80 range: \"Coordinated approach: Despite tensions, decree includes financing mechanisms that could work with either papal or conciliar administration. Practical compromise.\"\n\nThis is a solid middle-high result. Let me think through what this means practically.\n\nThe key tension is that Basel and the Pope are in conflict over authority. Basel just passed Annates Reform reducing papal revenues 75%. But crusade financing traditionally flows through papal mechanisms (tithes collected by bishops answering to Rome, indulgences issued by papal authority).\n\nA roll of 70 suggests the decree creates financing mechanisms that are deliberately designed to work regardless of whether Pope or Council has ultimate authority. This is clever Basel politics - they want the crusade to succeed, and they know jurisdictional fighting could kill it.\n\nWhat might this look like:\n- Crusade tithe proclaimed, but collection through metropolitan/provincial structures (bishops answering to their metropolitans, not directly to Rome or Basel)\n- Indulgences authorized in language that could be interpreted as either conciliar or papal grant\n- Possibly the Supervisory Commission (from reform decrees) given role in crusade fund oversight - this would be consistent with Basel's other reforms\n- Accountability mechanisms similar to Juan's Granada model\n- Funds held at designated banking houses (Medici? Florentine banks?) rather than in papal or conciliar treasuries\n\nThis is actually quite good for Juan - it means there's a realistic chance money might actually flow to support the crusade, and the mechanisms don't depend on resolving the papal-conciliar dispute first.\n\nLet me write this up.\n\n\nISSUE 4 RESULT: COORDINATED APPROACH\n\n\nA pragmatic solution emerges from Basel's deliberations - one that reflects the Como spirit of parallel authority.\n\n\n\nWhat Roll 70 Produces:\n\n\nThe Council fathers, acutely aware that jurisdictional warfare could strangle crusade financing before it begins, crafted mechanisms deliberately designed to function regardless of papal-conciliar tensions.\n\n\nFinancing Structure:\n\n\n1. Crusade Tithe\n\n\nThree-year tithe (1/10th clerical income) proclaimed for Constantinople defense\n\nCollection through metropolitan structure - archbishops coordinate within their provinces\n\nNeither Pope nor Council directly administers; existing Church hierarchy does\n\nAvoids the question of who has ultimate authority by using structures both recognize\n\n\n2. Indulgences\n\n\nPlenary indulgence for those who take the cross and serve in person\n\nPartial indulgence for financial contributors (scaled by amount)\n\nLanguage carefully crafted: granted \"by authority of this sacred Council in union with the Apostolic See\"\n\nAmbiguous enough that both Pope and Council can claim credit; clear enough that faithful can trust validity\n\nLocal bishops authorized to preach and administer - decentralized implementation\n\n\n3. Crusade Fund Administration\n\n\nCentral fund established, but held by designated banking houses (Florentine banks, likely Medici network) rather than papal Camera or conciliar treasury\n\nSupervisory Commission (from reform decrees) given oversight role - consistent with Basel's accountability emphasis\n\nQuarterly accounting required - Juan's Granada transparency model partially adopted\n\nFunds disbursed to designated military commanders upon verification of forces\n\n\n4. What It Doesn't Include\n\n\nNo direct papal treasury contribution (Council can't commit papal funds)\n\nNo specific florin targets\n\nNo enforcement mechanism for sovereigns who don't collect/remit tithe\n\n\n\nWhy This Works (Relatively):\n\n\nThe genius - or compromise - is that the system routes around the papal-conciliar conflict rather than trying to resolve it. Money flows through existing Church structures that predate the current crisis. Accountability mechanisms satisfy reformers. Ambiguous authority language lets both sides claim the crusade as their initiative.\n\n\nWill it raise massive funds? Probably not. Collection depends on individual bishops' enthusiasm. Many will pocket portions or claim local needs. The traditional leakage of medieval taxation applies.\n\n\nBut some money will flow. Pious donors have a clear mechanism. Bishops who genuinely care about Constantinople (and many do) can act. The framework exists.\n\n\n\nPractical Implications for Juan:\n\n\nHe is not solely dependent on Castilian treasury for extended operations\n\nCrusade fund may provide supplementary resources as they accumulate\n\nHospitaller coordination includes their own resources from Rhodes\n\nBut he cannot count on significant external financing arriving quickly\n\nHis 60,000 florins for wall repair and whatever Castile continues to provide remains the reliable core\n\nTreat any crusade fund disbursements as bonus, not baseline\n\n\nFor Parallel Legislation:\n\n\nThis financing structure is designed to be adoptable by Pope Eugenius. If he issues matching crusade bull with identical or similar language, the system works seamlessly. If he issues competing bull with different mechanisms, confusion results - but the Council's framework still functions independently.\n\n\n\nSummary So Far:\n\nIssue\nRoll\nResult\n1.

And what authority over secular forces?\n\nEmperor John VIII Palaiologos - It's his empire being defended; some might argue he should command\n\nNo Designation - Leave to future coordination; supreme commander emerges from circumstances\n\nDuke Philip of Burgundy - If he joins, his wealth/prestige might demand command (but he hasn't committed)\n\n\nComplicating Factors:\n\n\nDesignating Juan would alienate powers who haven't committed (France, Aragon)\n\nDesignating anyone else insults Juan, who made the only real commitment\n\nDesignating no one risks the \"competing lords seeking glory\" problem Juan warned about\n\nPapal legate appointment is the Pope's prerogative, not Council's\n\nByzantine sensitivities about Western commanders on their soil\n\n\nWhat This Roll Determines:\n\nRoll Range\nOutcome\n1-20\nNo designation: Decree punts entirely. \"Christian princes shall coordinate in spirit of unity.\" The very problem Juan warned about.\n21-40\nVague hierarchy: Papal legate given spiritual authority; military command left undefined. Recipe for conflict.\n41-60\nDiplomatic formula: \"Those princes who contribute forces shall coordinate under the senior among them.\" Implies Juan without naming him.\n61-80\nJuan acknowledged: Decree explicitly recognizes Castile's commitment and Juan's Granada experience. Stops short of formal supreme command but clearly elevates his status.\n81-100\nJuan designated: Unprecedented - Council names Juan as military commander of Constantinople expedition, subject only to coordination with Emperor John VIII. Clear authority.\n\n\nReady for your roll on Issue 5: Command Structure."

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed ambiguous decree outcome and its practical consequences.\n\nThe player rolled 26, which falls in the 21-40 range: \"Vague hierarchy: Papal legate given spiritual authority; military command left undefined. Recipe for conflict.\"\n\nThis is a problematic but realistic outcome. Let me think through what this means:\n\n1. The decree gives spiritual authority to a papal legate (to be appointed by the Pope)\n2. Military command is left undefined\n3. This creates exactly the divided command problem Juan warned about\n4. It's a classic ecclesiastical compromise - they address the spiritual dimension (which is their domain) and punt on the military question (which is more properly a secular matter)\n\nThis is frustrating given Juan's clear position and the only concrete commitment, but it's also very realistic for Basel. The Council:\n- Cannot bind sovereigns to accept another sovereign's command\n- Has French faction that would never accept Castilian supremacy\n- Has various national interests that would object to any specific designation\n- Falls back on traditional crusade structure (papal legate for spiritual matters)\n- Leaves military coordination to whoever actually shows up\n\nThe irony: Juan gets the most specific, operationally detailed crusade decree ever (Roll 100), but the one area left vague is his own authority.\n\nPractical implications:\n- Juan arrives with the only substantial force\n- A papal legate will presumably be appointed (by Eugenius, not Council)\n- That legate's relationship with Juan is undefined\n- If other forces arrive, command questions will need to be resolved ad hoc\n- Juan's de facto authority will depend on being the only one who showed up\n- His relationship with Emperor John VIII becomes even more crucial - the Byzantine emperor's recognition matters more than Basel's decree\n\n\nISSUE 5 RESULT: VAGUE HIERARCHY\n\n\nThe Council's boldness on logistics evaporates when it comes to command. Classic ecclesiastical behavior: be specific about things that don't threaten anyone, be vague about things that do.\n\n\n\nWhat Roll 26 Produces:\n\n\nSpiritual Authority: Papal Legate\n\n\nDecree calls for appointment of a papal legate to accompany the crusade\n\nLegate given authority over spiritual matters: preaching, confession, dispensations, ecclesiastical discipline\n\nTraditional crusade structure - nothing controversial here\n\nBUT: Council cannot appoint the legate. That's Pope Eugenius's prerogative.\n\nDecree merely \"requests\" the Holy Father designate an appropriate prelate\n\n\nMilitary Authority: Undefined\n\n\nDecree speaks of \"Christian princes coordinating their forces in spirit of fraternal unity\"\n\nNo supreme commander designated\n\nNo hierarchy established\n\nNo mechanism for resolving disputes between commanders\n\nThe very problem Juan explicitly warned about in his Basel speech\n\n\nWhy This Happened:\n\n\nThe German pragmatists who drove Roll 100's specificity on objectives and Roll 70's clever financing couldn't overcome national rivalries on command. French delegates would never accept Castilian supremacy. Aragonese delegates bristled at elevating a rival Trastámara. English and Burgundian delegates saw no reason to subordinate hypothetical future forces to a Spanish king.\n\n\nAnd Juan's own words - \"would submit to another if Council deemed them more worthy\" - gave them permission to defer. He offered humility; they took it.\n\n\nCardinal Cesarini likely argued for recognizing Juan's unique commitment. Emperor Sigismund probably supported his ally. But consensus in Basel's four deputations requires... consensus. And consensus on command was impossible.\n\n\n\nThe Bitter Irony:\n\n\nJuan receives a decree with:\n\n\nUnprecedented operational specificity (Roll 100)\n\nNo theological obstacles (Roll 18)\n\nCoordinated financing mechanisms (Roll 70)\n\nAnd zero formal authority to actually lead the expedition he alone is undertaking\n\n\nThe decree that was supposed to rally Christendom gives Juan a detailed mission but not the title to execute it.\n\n\n\nPractical Implications:\n\n\nDe Jure (In Law):\n\n\nJuan has no formal command authority from Basel\n\nA papal legate (not yet appointed) will have spiritual authority\n\nAny other prince who arrives could claim equal standing\n\nEmperor John VIII is the only recognized sovereign authority in Constantinople itself\n\n\nDe Facto (In Reality):\n\n\nJuan commands the only substantial Western force\n\n591 knights answer to him personally, not to Basel or Rome\n\nHospitaller forces will coordinate with him as the primary actor\n\nHis 60,000 florins for wall repair give him enormous practical leverage\n\nThe seventeen crusaders already in Constantinople have prepared the ground for HIS arrival\n\n\nWhat This Means for Constantinople:\n\n\nJuan's authority will be established through:\n\n\nEmperor John VIII's recognition - The Byzantine emperor welcoming him as ally/commander matters more than any Western decree\n\nDemonstrated competence - His Granada record speaks; his behavior in Constantinople will confirm or deny it\n\nBeing the only one who showed up - Hard to dispute command when you're the only commander present\n\nRelationship with papal legate - Whoever Eugenius appoints, Juan will need to work with them\n\n\nThe decree's vagueness is a problem if substantial reinforcements arrive. It's irrelevant if they don't.\n\n\nGiven Roll 25 (only Castile and Hospitallers committed), divided command may remain theoretical.\n\n\n\nSummary So Far:\n\nIssue\nRoll\nResult\n1. Scope & Target\n100\nUnprecedented specificity - Constantinople defense with concrete timelines\n2. Greek Schism\n18\nDiplomatic silence - neither demands union nor embraces brotherhood\n3. Specific Commitments\n25\nCastile + Hospitallers only; everyone else offers words\n4. Crusade Financing\n70\nCoordinated approach - mechanisms work regardless of papal-conciliar tensions\n5. Command Structure\n26\nVague hierarchy - papal legate spiritual authority, military command undefined\n\n\nISSUE 6: TIMELINE\n\n\nThe final issue: When should forces assemble, and where?\n\n\nWhat We Know:\n\n\nRoll 100 established that timeline IS included in decree (unusual specificity)\n\nDecree passed December 1433\n\nJuan already en route (left Barcelona March 1434, now in Rome)\n\nConstantinople needs aid urgently but is not under active siege\n\nOttoman Sultan Murad II is consolidating after recent campaigns\n\nStaging through Venice and/or Rhodes mentioned in decree framework\n\n\nThe Question: How aggressive is the timeline, and how realistic?\n\nRoll Range\nOutcome\n1-20\nAspirational nonsense: Timeline so aggressive it's already impossible by the time decree passes. \"Forces to assemble by Easter 1434.\" Demonstrates Basel's detachment from reality.\n21-40\nTight but symbolic: Spring/Summer 1434 target. Achievable only for those already committed (i.e., Juan). Everyone else will miss it.\n41-60\nRealistic: Late 1434 assembly, allowing time for sovereigns to respond, forces to muster, shipping to arrange. Juan arrives as vanguard, others could follow.\n61-80\nPhased approach: Immediate forces (Castile, Hospitallers) proceed; general assembly called for 1435. Acknowledges Juan's head start while allowing broader participation.\n81-100\nSophisticated logistics: Multiple phases, specific staging points, coordination mechanisms, contingency for Ottoman movements. Operational planning unusual for ecclesiastical decree.\n\n\nReady for your roll on Issue 6: Timeline."

Spring/Summer 1434 target that's only achievable for those already committed (Juan). Everyone else will miss it.\n\nThis fits well with the overall pattern we're seeing - a decree that's surprisingly specific on objectives (Roll 100) but that practically speaking is a Castilian expedition with Hospitaller support. The timeline essentially ratifies what Juan is already doing rather than creating a framework for broader participation.\n\nLet me write this up and then provide a comprehensive summary of all six issues.\n\n\nISSUE 6 RESULT: TIGHT BUT SYMBOLIC\n\n\nThe decree's timeline confirms what the other rolls suggested: this is Juan's expedition with ecclesiastical blessing, not a coordinated multinational crusade.\n\n\n\nWhat Roll 24 Produces:\n\n\nStated Timeline:\n\n\nForces to assemble at staging points by Summer 1434\n\nVenice and Rhodes designated as primary staging locations\n\nArrival at Constantinople before autumn storms make eastern Mediterranean sailing hazardous\n\n\"All Christian princes who would take the cross\" urged to dispatch forces \"with utmost haste\"\n\n\nThe Reality:\n\n\nBy the time the decree passes (December 1433) and is promulgated across Christendom (January-February 1434), the timeline is already impossible for anyone not already in motion.\n\n\nSovereigns must receive the decree, deliberate, commit resources, muster forces, arrange shipping, and travel\n\nMinimum realistic timeline for a new participant: 12-18 months from decision to arrival\n\nSummer 1434 deadline means: if you haven't already started, you won't make it\n\n\nWho Can Meet This Timeline:\n\n\nJuan II of Castile - Already en route. Will arrive Constantinople well within deadline.\n\nKnights of St. John - Already based at Rhodes. Can coordinate immediately.\n\nNobody else - Even if Burgundy, Venice, or others decided tomorrow to participate, they couldn't muster and ship meaningful forces by summer 1434.\n\n\n\nWhy This Timeline:\n\n\nTwo possibilities (likely both):\n\n\nOptimistic Interpretation: \nThe German pragmatists who drove Roll 100's specificity genuinely wanted urgency. Constantinople's need is real. They set an aggressive timeline hoping to inspire rapid action.\n\n\nCynical Interpretation:\nThose who wanted to appear supportive without committing found an aggressive timeline convenient. \"Of course we support the crusade! But alas, the timeline makes participation impossible for us. Perhaps next year...\"\n\n\nThe timeline makes the decree look urgent and serious while practically ensuring only those already committed (Castile, Hospitallers) will participate in the initial phase.\n\n\n\nPractical Implications:\n\n\nFor Juan:\n\n\nThe decree's timeline validates his existing schedule\n\nHe's not early or rushing ahead - he's the only one meeting the stated deadline\n\nProvides rhetorical cover: \"I am here in obedience to the sacred Council's decree\"\n\nAny criticism of his \"unilateral\" action can be deflected: \"Where are the others?\"\n\n\nFor Future Reinforcements:\n\n\nThe tight timeline creates a problem: those who miss Summer 1434 have technically \"failed\" to meet the decree\n\nWill the Council issue follow-up calls? Extend the timeline?\n\nOr will Constantinople's defense simply become \"Castile's project\" by default?\n\n\nFor Emperor John VIII:\n\n\nByzantine expectations calibrated by decree: Western forces arriving Summer 1434\n\nJuan will meet this expectation\n\nNo one else will\n\nGreeks will draw conclusions about Western commitment\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE SUMMARY: THE CRUSADE DECREE\n\nIssue\nRoll\nResult\n1. Scope & Target\n100\nUnprecedented specificity - Constantinople defense with concrete timelines, Sultan Murad II named, wall repair mentioned\n2. Greek Schism\n18\nDiplomatic silence - \"Christians in peril,\" no union demands, no brotherhood language\n3. Specific Commitments\n25\nCastile + Hospitallers only; all others offer words without binding pledges\n4. Crusade Financing\n70\nCoordinated approach - three-year tithe, indulgences, banking administration; works regardless of papal-conciliar tensions\n5.

      "say": "Thought process: Identified vagueness in crusade termination clause and its practical implications.\n\nThe user raises an excellent point. Looking back at the decree I drafted, there's no clear termination clause or definition of when the crusade ends. The objectives are:\n\n1. Primary: Wall repair\n2. Secondary: Military garrison until walls repaired and Empire can restore its forces\n\nBut there's no explicit end condition. When are the walls \"repaired\"? When can the Empire \"restore its forces\"? That could be never - the Byzantine Empire is in terminal decline.\n\nThis is actually a significant issue Juan would notice. He's a practical man who ran the Granada campaign with clear objectives. He'd spot this vagueness immediately.\n\nLet me think about this realistically:\n\n1. The decree says forces serve \"until walls are repaired and the Empire can restore its own forces\" (Article I, §3)\n2. But there's no mechanism for declaring the walls repaired\n3. There's no definition of when the Empire has \"restored its forces\"\n4. There's no maximum duration\n5. There's no process for releasing crusaders from their vows\n\nThis is typical of medieval crusade documents - they tend to be vague about termination because:\n- Crusades often dragged on indefinitely\n- The Church wanted to maintain leverage over crusaders\n- Defining clear end points limits ecclesiastical control\n- Political circumstances change\n\nFor Juan specifically, this matters because:\n- He has ~600 knights with him\n- They have families, estates, obligations back home\n- Military Order knights have duties in Castile\n- He needs to return to govern his kingdom\n- Isabel is pregnant again\n- His daughter Catalina is only 2\n\nThe realistic answer is: the decree doesn't specify when it ends. This is both historically authentic and problematic.\n\nLet me present this to the player accurately - Juan would indeed find this vague, and it's a real issue he might want to address with the Pope or in his own agreements with Emperor John VIII.\n\n\nJuan's eye catches something important. Looking back at the decree's language:\n\n\nArticle I, §3:\n\n\"...ut milites Christiani ad defendendam urbem sufficiant donec muri reparati sint et Imperium vires suas restaurare possit.\"\n\n\n\"...that Christian soldiers suffice for defending the city until the walls are repaired and the Empire can restore its own forces.\"\n\n\nThe Problem:\n\n\nThere's no termination clause. No mechanism for declaring the walls \"repaired.\" No definition of when the Empire has \"restored its forces.\" No maximum duration. No process for releasing crusaders from their oaths.\n\n\nWhen can the Empire restore its forces? The Byzantine treasury is empty. Their military has been collapsing for decades. That condition could remain unfulfilled... forever.\n\n\n\nThis is historically authentic.\n\n\nMedieval crusade documents were notoriously vague about termination precisely because:\n\n\nThe Church wanted to maintain leverage over crusaders\n\nDefining clear endpoints limited ecclesiastical authority\n\nPolitical circumstances were unpredictable\n\nVague language allowed flexible interpretation\n\n\nThe Second Crusade, the Third Crusade, the various failed expeditions—none had clear \"mission accomplished\" criteria. Men went East and either died, went home when they felt their vow was fulfilled, or stayed indefinitely.\n\n\n\nFor Juan specifically, this matters:\n\n\nHis ~600 knights have families, estates, obligations in Castile\n\nMilitary Order knights have duties defending Granada's new frontier\n\nHe needs to return to govern his kingdom\n\nIsabel is pregnant\n\nCatalina is only 2 years old\n\nPrince Fernando is in Toledo without his father\n\n\nThe decree provides no answer to the question: \"When can my men go home?\"\n\n\n\nPossible Interpretations:\n\n\nMinimalist: Once the 60,000 florins are spent on wall repairs, the \"wall repair\" objective is complete. Juan's commitment is fulfilled.\n\nModerate: Walls repaired + city secure from immediate threat = mission complete. A campaigning season or two.\n\nMaximalist: Permanent garrison until Byzantine Empire recovers. Effectively never.\n\n\n\nWhat Juan Can Do:\n\n\nThis vagueness is exactly the kind of thing he might raise with Pope Eugenius IV during their upcoming audience. A papal clarification—or a separate agreement with Emperor John VIII—could establish concrete criteria:\n\n\nSpecific wall sections to be repaired\n\nA defined garrison period (one year? two years?)\n\nConditions under which crusaders are released from vows\n\nRotation mechanisms for fresh forces\n\n\nThe decree's silence on termination is a gap Juan noticed that others likely didn't think about. The man who ran Granada with clear objectives and timelines would find this ecclesiastical vagueness... frustrating.\n\n\nDoes Juan wish to raise this with Eugenius, or establish his own terms with Emperor John VIII, or both?"
