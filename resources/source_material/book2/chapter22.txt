Synthesized campaign status, identified outstanding conflicts, and prepared chapter setup














Now let me search for the Kingdom guide to understand the broader context:


Synthesized game state and prepared immersive chapter opening




I now have a complete picture of the campaign. Let me begin Chapter 2.22, continuing from where we left off on March 24, 1434 in Rome.

CHAPTER 2.22: THE MORNING AFTER PROVIDENCE
Date: March 24, 1434 (Dawn) Location: Palazzo di San Marco, Rome

The bells of Sant'Agnese tolled Prime as grey light filtered through shuttered windows.

Juan had slept poorly. The day before had been a tapestry of triumphs and failures—the golden light at St. Peter's, RochetaillÃ©e's impossible conversion, and then the slow unraveling through the afternoon and evening. Cardinal Orsini's face when Juan had tried to force his hand. "I will continue to fulfill my obligations." Not an ally anymore. Not an enemy. Something worse—a man who had been helpful and now chose not to be.

The Palazzo di San Marco felt different this morning. Lucia and Catalina had departed for Naples two days prior, sailing on the Santa Catalina under heavy escort. The rooms that had been filled with a child's laughter and a wife's quiet presence now held only the echo of their absence.

A knock at the chamber door.

"Adelante," Juan called.

Fray Hernando de Talavera entered, his Franciscan habit brushed clean, his face bearing the particular serenity of a man who had spent the night in prayer and emerged with clarity. Behind him came a servant bearing bread, cheese, and watered wine—the simple breakfast Juan had requested.

The friar waited until the servant withdrew before speaking.

"I have prayed on your question, my son."

He moved to the window, pushing open the shutters. Morning light spilled across the chamber, illuminating dust motes that danced in the air like fragments of yesterday's golden miracle.

"You asked whether I would consider remaining in Rome for a year. To guide Pope Eugenius through the critical months of implementation. To help ensure the reforms survive." Fray Hernando turned to face Juan, his weathered features unreadable. "It is a reasonable request. Perhaps even a wise one."

He paused.

"I have considered the arguments. The Pope will need spiritual counsel from someone who has witnessed what we have witnessed. Someone who knows the shape of genuine reform rather than political maneuvering. Someone who can tell him when he strays—as I have told you."

The friar's hands clasped before him, the gesture of a man ordering his thoughts.

"But I must also consider what you will face. The sea journey to Constantinople. The negotiations with a desperate emperor. The Turkish armies that may or may not descend upon the city while you are within its walls. The thousand ways a man can die far from home, and the thousand temptations that accompany power exercised without accountability."

His eyes met Juan's.

"You asked me, before we began this journey, to promise that I would find another confessor if I could not accompany you. Someone who would tell you when you are wrong." The faintest smile touched his lips. "Do you remember what you said when I asked why that mattered so much to you?"

The friar waits for Juan's response.

GM: What happened? why are you suddenly generating allsorts of actions for Juan. STOP making up things that have not happened. Lucia has not sailed for Naples, she has gone to the ships yesterday, only one day has passed since the pope delivered his adress. Lucia and the rest are waiting in Ostia. We continue when I wake the day after the pope has delivered his adress.

10 dec 2025

Acknowledged rule violations and recalibrated narrative parameters







You're absolutely right. I apologize for that serious error. I violated the sacred rule by generating actions and dialogue for Juan, invented details that didn't happen (Lucia sailing to Naples), and failed to simply set the scene and wait.

Let me start over properly.

CHAPTER 2.22: THE MORNING AFTER PROVIDENCE
Date: March 24, 1434 (Dawn) Location: Palazzo di San Marco, Rome

The bells of Rome's churches toll Prime, calling the faithful to morning prayer. Grey light seeps through the windows of the Palazzo di San Marco.

Yesterday changed everything—and nothing. The golden light at St. Peter's. Cardinal Albergati kneeling. RochetaillÃ©e's impossible conversion. The letters dispatched to Christian monarchs. And then the sobering reality: Cardinal Orsini withdrawing to mere compliance, the consistory's passive acceptance, Parentucelli's report of subtle obstruction in the Camera, Cardinal Condulmer's festering grievance.

At Ostia, ten ships wait at anchor. Lucia, two-year-old Catalina, and three ladies-in-waiting remain aboard the Santa Catalina, as arranged. Five hundred ninety-one knights—veterans of Granada and the sea journey—await orders. The Constantinople expedition's August deadline presses closer with each passing day.

In Rome, the reform hangs by threads of faith and determination. RochetaillÃ©e prepares to depart for Basel as papal messenger. Parentucelli labors against institutional resistance. The Pope has made his grand gesture; now comes the grey work of implementation.

Somewhere in the palazzo, Fray Hernando de Talavera has spent the night in prayer, considering Juan's request that he remain in Rome for a year to guide the Pope through the critical implementation period.

The morning waits.

What does Juan do?

I assemble all my knights to adress them.

10 dec 2025

Deliberating whether assembling knights requires traveling to Ostia



The knights are at Ostia, a half-day's ride from Rome.

Does Juan ride to Ostia to address them there, or does he send word for them to march to Rome?

The knights are near the Vatican. I walked them there to witness the pope's adress.

10 dec 2025

Situated knights near Vatican, prepared scene-setting narrative


You're right—the 591 knights witnessed the Mass at St. Peter's yesterday, their "Deo gratias" shaking the basilica after Juan's oath. They would be quartered in Rome, likely in the buildings and courtyards that the Vatican and allied Roman families have made available.

Word spreads quickly through the knights' quarters. Within the hour, they have assembled in the courtyard of the Palazzo di San Marco—the largest space available that can accommodate nearly six hundred men.

They stand in ranks, these veterans of Granada. Many bear the scars of the Reconquista—a missing finger here, a limping gait there, the weathered faces of men who have seen siege and battle. Their white surcoats with red crosses are travel-worn but clean, maintained with the discipline of soldiers who take pride in their appearance.

Among them stand the faces Juan knows well: Marco Tornesi, the former mercenary seeking redemption. Andrea Vescovi, the gangly farmer's son who was the first to take the crusader oath in Barcelona four years ago. Giovanni Rossi, the former blacksmith who prays more than anyone. Brother Guillem, the Benedictine monk-warrior. Captain Rodrigo and Sergeant García, who have been with Juan since the beginning.

The morning sun catches the red crosses on their chests. Five hundred ninety-one men who followed their king across the sea, witnessed the golden light in St. Peter's, and now wait to learn what comes next.

The courtyard falls silent as Juan steps forward.

The knights wait for their king to speak.

Brothers, 

Yesterday, we have witnessed how the pope reformed the church. A truly momentous occasion we have had the privilege to bear witness of. Today we continue our journey east to Constantinople. 

I have pledged myself to protect the church and in order to protect the pope, I will require some of our number to remain behind. To observe and to signal if anyone decides to take up arms against the holy father. I require about 10 to remain here. You will not remain here forever, just for a while as the church absorbs this change. You will all return to Castille. 

I look at Hernando, letting him know that this is his choice if hje wants to stay as well. 

Brothers! Have a good meal and cast your eyes on Rome for a final time, for we leave in a few hours for Ostia and the ships.

Orchestrated narrative response to knights' speech and Fray Hernando's pivotal moment




A murmur ripples through the assembled knights—not dissent, but the sound of men absorbing news. Constantinople. The name carries weight. They knew this was coming, had known since they boarded ships in Castile, but hearing it spoken aloud makes it real.

Marco Tornesi straightens almost imperceptibly, the former mercenary's eyes bright with something that might be anticipation. Andrea Vescovi glances at the men beside him, then back to Juan, his young face solemn. Giovanni Rossi's lips move silently—a prayer, likely.

When Juan calls for ten to remain, hands begin to rise. Not eagerly, not reluctantly—with the steady resolve of men who understand duty. More than ten. Perhaps fifteen or eighteen hands.

Captain Rodrigo steps forward slightly, his voice carrying across the courtyard. "We'll sort it among ourselves, Your Majesty. Ten good men who can keep their eyes open and their mouths shut."

A rumble of assent from the ranks.

Fray Hernando meets Juan's gaze. The Franciscan's weathered face is still, but something passes between them—acknowledgment of the choice being offered, the weight of it.

He does not speak. Not here, not before the men. But he inclines his head, very slightly. The conversation will come. Later.

"¡Por Castilla y por Cristo!" someone shouts from the ranks—and five hundred voices take up the cry, echoing off the palazzo walls.

"¡Por Castilla y por Cristo!"

The knights begin to disperse toward their morning meal. Does Juan wish to speak with anyone before departing for Ostia?

I bid my farewell to the pope and to Tommaso. I tell them to continue the work, that I am leaving 10 men behind, they will signal if anyone wants to move against them, but there seems to be no-one who is opposing us, especially with the Orsini cooperating and the Colonna effectively eliminated. I will meet with them after my visit to Constantinople. 

Then, I travel to Ostia and seek our Lucia and Catalina.

10 dec 2025

Calibrated realistic response to player's optimistic political assessment





The Vatican, Morning

Pope Eugenius IV receives Juan in the same private chamber where they drafted the letter to Basel. The Pope looks tired—the grey exhaustion of a man who slept little after a day of momentous action—but there is steel beneath the weariness that was not there a week ago.

Tommaso Parentucelli stands beside him, dark circles under his eyes, ink stains on his fingers. The scholar-administrator has clearly worked through the night.

When Juan speaks of the ten men remaining behind, Eugenius nods slowly. "A kind gesture. Though ten knights against Rome's factions..." He does not finish the thought. "We are grateful nonetheless. They will be housed and fed at Vatican expense."

Parentucelli clears his throat. "Your Majesty speaks of Cardinal Orsini's cooperation. I would... temper that assessment somewhat." His voice is careful, diplomatic. "The Cardinal fulfills his obligations. He provides information when asked directly. But he no longer volunteers intelligence. No longer anticipates needs. The difference is subtle but significant."

The Pope's jaw tightens slightly. "And Cardinal Condulmer remains in his chambers. My own nephew. He has not spoken to me since yesterday morning."

Eugenius rises, moving to the window that overlooks the city.

"You sail east to aid Constantinople against the Turk. A holy mission. We will pray for your success daily." He turns back to face Juan. "But understand what you leave behind. The reform has the support of princes and bankers. It has the acquiescence of cardinals who cannot oppose it. What it lacks..."

He pauses, searching for words.

"What it lacks is men who believe in it. Aside from Parentucelli here, and perhaps RochetaillÃ©e—who departs today for Basel—the reform stands on fear and calculation, not conviction."

The Pope seems to be waiting for Juan's response before concluding the farewell.

I leave it to the pope to appoint those who operate in this reformed church. Who have the conviction we seek. This will take time. Even a thousand knights would not help in this regard. 

You are secured. If anyone moves against you, Naples and Castille stand ready to come to your aid immediately, and our enemies know this. Our reform has been recieved very well. Now comes the work to follow up. Maybe the pope will be able to find those servants in Basel. 

Speak to cardinal Rochetaille before he leaves and ask him for men who can replace who have been tainted by corruption. 

You have the treasury as well. Guard it and use it if need be to build a new church. Almost everything has been ghoing our way. What remains is just honest work.

10 dec 2025

Orchestrated papal reassurance and mapped practical succession strategy




Eugenius listens, his fingers steepled before him. For a moment, the weight of his office seems to press down upon him—this man who confessed to being a coward, who found his courage only yesterday.

"Basel," he murmurs. "Yes. Perhaps there are men there who hunger for a Church worth serving, not merely a benefice worth holding." He glances at Parentucelli. "Tommaso, before Cardinal RochetaillÃ©e departs—speak with him. Ask him to identify reformers of genuine conviction. Men who can be brought to Rome."

"Yes, Holiness." Parentucelli bows his head, already making mental notes.

The Pope crosses to Juan and takes his hands—an intimate gesture, monarch to monarch, but also something more. Spiritual father to spiritual son.

"You speak wisdom beyond your years, Juan of Castile. 'Honest work.' Yes. That is what remains." A ghost of a smile crosses his gaunt features. "We have grown accustomed to miracles these past days. Golden light and impossible conversions. Now comes the grey labor of making those miracles permanent."

He releases Juan's hands and makes the sign of the cross over him.

"Benedictio Dei omnipotentis, Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, descendat super te et maneat semper. Go with God to Constantinople. Defend the faith against the Turk as you have defended it against corruption. And return to us safely."

Parentucelli steps forward, offering his own bow. "Your Majesty. What you have begun here... I will not let it fail. Whatever it costs."

The Road to Ostia, Midday

The ride takes several hours through the Roman campagna—past ancient aqueducts and crumbling monuments, through villages where peasants pause their labor to watch the column of knights pass. The red crosses on white surcoats draw stares, whispers, the sign of the cross from old women in doorways.

Fray Hernando rides beside Juan in silence for much of the journey. He has not yet spoken of his decision.

Ostia, Early Afternoon

The port spreads before them—ten ships riding at anchor in the Tiber's mouth, their masts swaying gently with the current. The Santa Catalina flies the royal standard of Castile.

Juan finds Lucia aboard, in the great cabin. Two-year-old Catalina sits on the floor, playing with a wooden horse carved by one of the sailors. She looks up as Juan enters, her face breaking into a smile.

"Papá!"

Lucia rises from where she has been watching their daughter. Her belly has begun to show now—five months along, perhaps six. She moves more carefully than she once did.

"Juan." Her eyes search his face, reading the weariness there, the weight of what he carries. "The men say we sail today."

Lucia waits for Juan to speak.

GM: Lucia is not pregnant for that long. 

I lift up Catalina. 

How has my little girl been? Have you seen things on the ships? And in the port?

10 dec 2025

Recalibrated character timeline and refocused narrative momentum


Catalina squeals with delight as Juan lifts her, her small hands reaching for his face. At two years old, she has her mother's dark eyes and a child's boundless curiosity.

"Barcos!" she announces proudly, pointing toward the porthole. "Agua!" Her vocabulary is expanding rapidly—a new word seemingly every day. She babbles something incomprehensible but clearly important about the ships, gesturing emphatically with one hand while clutching Juan's collar with the other.

"She has been fascinated by everything," Lucia says, a tired smile softening her features. "The sailors. The ropes. The seabirds. One of the men—Pascual, I think—carved her that horse. She won't let it out of her sight."

Catalina squirms in Juan's arms, showing him the wooden horse clutched in her fist. "Caballo!" She makes it gallop through the air between them.

"The port..." Lucia's smile fades slightly. "Busy. Roman merchants, mostly. Some looked at our ships with too much interest for my comfort. Doña Beatriz thinks they were merely curious, but..." She shrugs. "I will be glad when we are at sea again."

She moves closer, lowering her voice so only Juan can hear over Catalina's continued narration of her horse's adventures.

"What happened in Rome? The men speak of golden light and cardinals kneeling. Some say it was a miracle."

Lucia watches Juan, waiting for the truth behind the rumors.

I tell her everything as we get ready to depart for Naples. 

I have been hammering away love. Lets hope it comes out as a beautiful piece when the steel sets. Or maybe I will have to come back and get back to hammering again.

10 dec 2025

Orchestrated intimate scene sharing Rome's triumphs and setbacks before Naples departure






Catalina plays with her wooden horse on the cabin floor as Juan speaks. The gentle creaking of the ship and the distant calls of sailors preparing for departure form a backdrop to his account.

He tells her everything. The Mass at St. Peter's—the golden light that poured through the windows as Eugenius spoke, the cardinals who knelt, the "Deo gratias" that shook the basilica. RochetaillÃ©e's impossible conversion. The letters dispatched to every Christian monarch.

And then the rest. Cardinal Orsini's face when Juan pushed too hard. The consistory's passive acceptance without conviction. Parentucelli's reports of subtle obstruction. Cardinal Condulmer nursing his grievance. The hollow center that RochetaillÃ©e himself had identified—external support but weak internal commitment.

Lucia listens without interrupting, her hands busy folding garments into a chest, the practical work of a queen preparing for a voyage. When Juan finishes with his metaphor about hammering steel, she pauses.

"A blacksmith knows when the metal is ready," she says quietly. "And when it needs more time at the forge." She closes the chest and turns to face him. "You have done what you could in Rome. More than anyone expected. More than anyone had a right to ask."

She glances at Catalina, who is making her horse climb up the leg of a chair.

"But Constantinople is not Rome, Juan. The Turks are not cardinals who can be shamed into kneeling." Her voice carries no judgment—only the plain observation of a wife who has learned to speak truth to her husband. "What waits for us in the East?"

From above, the shouts of sailors grow more urgent. The ship is nearly ready to sail.

I ask the captain how the exercises have gone while I was away.

10 dec 2025

Excavated prior drill records and prepared captain's assessment





Juan finds the captain of the Santa Catalina on deck—a weathered Castilian named Diego de Vargas, grey-bearded and sun-darkened from decades at sea. He straightens when Juan approaches, knuckling his forehead in respect.

"Your Majesty. The exercises." He sucks his teeth, the gesture of a man choosing his words carefully. "Better than the first day. Not yet what I'd want if the Mistral caught us in open water."

He gestures toward the other ships riding at anchor.

"We've run the storm drill twice more since you left for the Vatican. The San Marcos and Catalina perform well—Pascual's crew especially. They've taken to the competitions. Drinks for the fastest crew to secure rigging." A hint of a smile. "Sailors will race for wine when they won't race for duty."

The smile fades.

"The converted carracks still struggle. Their crews weren't trained for war or weather—merchant sailors, most of them. They're learning, but..." He shrugs. "The journey to Naples is short. The journey to Constantinople is not. I'd want more time to drill them properly, but time is what we lack."

He looks out at the assembled fleet.

"We'll be ready for Naples by the evening tide, Your Majesty. As for what comes after—we'll keep drilling. Every calm day, every safe harbor. The men understand the stakes now."

The captain waits to see if Juan has further questions or orders.

We sail for Naples. 

Draft a d100 table to see what happens on the journey.

Architected d100 encounter table for Mediterranean voyage







CHAOS ROLL: Ostia to Naples

Distance: ~150 nautical miles Expected journey: 2-3 days depending on conditions Season: Late March (spring weather, generally favorable)

Factors in Play:

Ten ships, mixed crew quality (veterans on warships, learning merchant sailors on carracks)
Royal family aboard (Lucia, Catalina, ladies-in-waiting)
581 knights as passengers
Tyrrhenian Sea in spring—usually calm, but changeable
Barbary corsairs occasionally raid this coast
Naples under Aragonese influence (King Alfonso V, ally)
Roll	Outcome
1-5	Disaster. Sudden squall catches the fleet. One of the struggling carracks founders or suffers critical damage. Lives may be lost. Significant delay and emergency repairs required.
6-15	Serious trouble. Corsair sighting forces defensive formation. Or: A carrack falls badly behind and must be towed. Or: Illness spreads aboard one ship. Fleet limps into Naples with problems to solve.
16-30	Difficult passage. Rough seas test the crews. The converted carracks struggle visibly. No disaster, but the journey exposes weaknesses that must be addressed before Constantinople. Morale shaken.
31-50	Uneventful. Fair winds, calm seas, routine sailing. The fleet reaches Naples without incident. Nothing learned, nothing lost.
51-70	Good sailing. Conditions permit additional drilling. Crews show improvement. The journey builds confidence. Fleet arrives in good order.
71-85	Excellent passage. Strong favorable winds, exceptional time. Carrack crews finally begin working as a unit. Captain Vargas reports genuine progress. Fleet arrives ahead of schedule with high morale.
86-95	Fortune smiles. The journey includes a notable positive event—perhaps news from a passing vessel, a crew breakthrough, or an encounter that proves advantageous.
96-100	Exceptional. Something remarkable occurs. Providence seems to follow the fleet.
Ready to roll when you give the word.

10 dec 2025

Orchestrated dramatic corsair encounter, paused for Juan's tactical intervention



The Tyrrhenian Sea, Second Day Out

The first day passed without incident—fair winds from the north, the fleet making good time along the Italian coast. Catalina delighted in watching the dolphins that played in the Santa Catalina's wake. The carrack crews, drilled relentlessly by their captains, showed signs of improvement.

Then, on the morning of the second day, the lookout's cry shattered the calm.

"¡Velas! Velas al sur!"

Juan reaches the deck to find Captain Vargas already at the rail, shading his eyes against the morning glare. Three ships on the southern horizon, their lateen sails unmistakable.

"Corsairs," Vargas says flatly. "Out of Tunis or Algiers, most like. Galleys—fast and nimble. They've seen us."

The three vessels have altered course. They're not fleeing.

Vargas turns to Juan, his face grim.

"They won't attack ten ships, Your Majesty—not unless they're mad or desperate. But our carracks are slow. If they shadow us, probe for weakness, catch a straggler..." He gestures toward the Santa María, the sluggish converted merchantman bringing up the rear. She's already falling behind, her inexperienced crew struggling to match the fleet's pace.

"We can hold formation and protect her—but that slows everyone. Or we can signal the warships to chase them off—but that splits the fleet and leaves the carracks vulnerable. Or..."

He pauses.

"Or we ignore them and push for Naples at best speed. If the Santa María can keep up, well and good. If not..."

Three corsair galleys shadow the fleet. The Santa María struggles to maintain pace. Captain Vargas awaits orders.

STOP when Juan can take an action or can intervene.

10 dec 2025

Recognized scenario already established; awaited player's intervention decision



I've already set the scene based on your roll of 14. The situation is:

Three corsair galleys are shadowing the fleet from the south
The Santa María (a converted carrack with inexperienced crew) is falling behind
Captain Vargas has presented three options:
Hold formation and protect the straggler (slows everyone)
Send warships to chase off the corsairs (splits the fleet)
Push for Naples at best speed and hope the Santa María keeps up
What does Juan do?

GM: All carracks are newly built remember? They have been completed together with the Princess Catalina. (not the santa Catalina)

Captain, we form up with the carracks on front, shielding the slower, less defended ships. If they come close, fire the cannons. We are well-armed, let them know that we are looking for a fight.

10 dec 2025

Reconciled correction and orchestrated tactical defensive formation



You're right—I apologize for the error. The carracks are newly constructed vessels, built alongside the Princesa Catalina as part of the naval expansion. Their crews are still learning to work together, but the ships themselves are sound and well-armed.

Captain Vargas nods sharply at Juan's command.

"¡A sus puestos!" he bellows. "¡Formación de escudo!"

Signal flags run up the mast. Across the fleet, captains respond. The five warships—galleys built for speed and combat—spread into a protective screen. The carracks, heavy and bristling with cannons, form up at the front of the formation, their gun ports open, bronze barrels glinting in the morning sun.

The Santa Catalina and the other ships carrying passengers and cargo tuck in behind this wall of oak and iron.

"Run out the guns," Vargas orders. "Let them see what welcomes them."

The rumble of cannon carriages rolling forward echoes across the water. Smoke rises from the slow matches held ready by the gunners.

The corsair galleys continue their approach for several minutes, closing the distance. Then, as the formation becomes clear—as the morning light catches the cannon barrels and the red crosses on white surcoats lining the rails—the lead galley's oars shift rhythm.

They're turning.

Vargas watches, his weathered face unreadable.

"They're not fools," he mutters. "Three galleys against this? They'd take one ship, maybe two, and lose all three in the doing."

The corsairs swing wide to the south, maintaining distance now, still watching.

"They'll shadow us to the edge of their range. Looking for any ship that falls behind or breaks formation."

The fleet holds formation, cannons ready. Naples is still a day's sailing. The corsairs pace them like wolves following a herd.

Does Juan wish to do anything, or maintain course and formation?

Continue on to Naples. We sail ahead. 

I show Catalina the ships and tell her they are the bad muslims who come to take her and mama away from me.

10 dec 2025

Orchestrated scene continuation with corsair encounter and narrative consequences






The fleet holds formation, the carracks maintaining their wall of guns, the warships prowling the flanks. The corsairs shadow them through the afternoon, three predators waiting for weakness that never comes.

Juan brings Catalina to the deck, holding her securely as she points at the distant sails. Her dark eyes are wide with curiosity—at two years old, she does not yet understand danger. Ships are ships. Sails are pretty things that catch the wind.

"¿Barcos, Papá?" she asks, pointing.

Juan tells her about the bad Muslims who want to take her and Mama away. Catalina's face scrunches in concentration, trying to understand. She looks at the distant ships, then back at her father.

"No," she says firmly, with all the conviction a two-year-old can muster. She clutches her wooden horse tighter and shakes her head. "No quiero."

Lucia appears at Juan's side, one hand resting on the rail. She watches the corsairs with a queen's composure, though her other hand rests instinctively on her belly.

"She's too young to understand," Lucia says quietly. "But not too young to remember. My grandmother used to tell me stories of Barbary raids on the Portuguese coast. Whole villages taken. Children who never saw their parents again."

She looks at Juan.

"This is why you go to Constantinople. This is why you build ships." It is not a question.

Nightfall

The corsairs finally turn away as darkness falls, vanishing into the southern blackness. But the night passage is tense—lanterns hooded, watches doubled, every man straining at shadows on the water.

By morning, the fleet is exhausted. The carrack crews, already inexperienced, have been pushed hard maintaining formation through the night. Two men on the San Juan Bautista collapsed from exhaustion and must be carried below.

Naples Harbor, Late Afternoon, March 26, 1434

The fleet limps into Naples under the shadow of Vesuvius. They have arrived intact—no ships lost, no men taken—but the cost is visible. Tired crews. Frayed nerves. The knowledge that the journey to Constantinople will cross far more dangerous waters than these.

Captain Vargas finds Juan as the anchors drop.

"We made it, Your Majesty. But if those had been Turkish galleys instead of Tunisian corsairs—faster, better armed, more numerous..." He shakes his head. "The men need rest. The carrack crews need more drilling. And we need to think hard about the route east."

The fleet rides at anchor in Naples harbor. Alfonso V's city spreads before them.

What does Juan do?

Start training for hostile naval encounters as well captain. 

I head for the harbour and meet with the master. 

Is king ALfonso in Naples?

10 dec 2025

Reconciled timeline inconsistencies and confirmed Alfonso's Naples whereabouts









"Aye, Your Majesty. Hostile encounters." Vargas's weathered face is grim. "We'll drill boarding defense, cannon coordination, the works. The men won't like it, but they'll like the bottom of the sea even less."

He heads off, already shouting orders.

Naples Harbor

The harbormaster is a portly Neapolitan named Giancarlo, sweating in the afternoon heat despite the March breeze. He bows repeatedly when he realizes who has arrived—ten ships flying Castilian colors, knights in crusader surcoats lining the rails.

"Your Majesty! We had no word—the harbor is honored—" He fumbles with his ledger, clearly flustered.

When Juan asks about King Alfonso, the harbormaster's bowing intensifies.

"His Majesty King Alfonso is indeed in Naples, Your Majesty. He holds court at Castel Nuovo." He gestures toward the imposing fortress visible from the harbor—five great towers connected by curtain walls, dominating the waterfront. "His Majesty has been in residence since... since the autumn, I believe. Managing affairs of the kingdom."

The harbormaster hesitates, then adds in a lower voice:

"There is much activity at the castle these days, Your Majesty. Messengers coming and going. Ships from Aragon and Sicily. I am only a humble servant of the port, but..." He shrugs meaningfully. "Something is being planned, they say."

The harbormaster waits to assist with docking arrangements. Castel Nuovo looms over the harbor. Alfonso V is in residence.

What does Juan do?

GM: It's time to make a thorough evaluation of the situation in Naples and the events of our timeline that have influenced it. I have made various rolls for developments in this game. Time to find out what the situation is. Has Alfonso finally been able to secure the throne? 

Evaluate the situation as it is currently and then draft a d100 table to see what has been happening the past 3 months.

SITUATION ASSESSMENT: NAPLES, MARCH 1434

Let me search for relevant information about the Naples situation and Alfonso V's campaign in our timeline.


Synthesized campaign timeline and crafted progression table for Naples






SITUATION ASSESSMENT: NAPLES, MARCH 1434

Based on campaign records, the situation is as follows:

What We Know:

Papal Endorsement (April 1433): Pope Eugenius IV's decree explicitly supported Alfonso's Naples claim and declared competing claims invalid. This was nearly a year ago.
Castilian Support:
40,000 florins disbursed (October 1433) to hire condottiero Francesco Sforza
4 armed carracks anchored at Valencia as show of force
Diplomatic pressure applied to Genoa and Milan
Previous Campaign Roll (63/100 - Significant Progress, circa November 1433):
Louis III of Anjou dying of malaria
Alfonso landed forces at Reggio
Calabrian barons declaring for Aragon (Count of Catanzaro, Duke of Sessa, Prince of Taranto)
Queen Joanna sent secret envoys offering adoption again
Alfonso expected to control half the kingdom by summer
What's Changed:
Nearly four months have passed since that assessment
The harbormaster reports "much activity" and "something being planned"
Messengers coming and going from Aragon and Sicily
Key Uncertainties:

Is Louis III of Anjou dead yet?
Has Queen Joanna formally adopted Alfonso (again)?
How have other Italian powers (Milan, Genoa, Florence, the Papacy itself) responded?
Has René of Anjou (Louis III's brother and heir to the Angevin claim) mobilized?

1-5	Disaster. Something has gone catastrophically wrong. Naval defeat, Alfonso captured or killed, major betrayal by supposed allies. The Naples dream may be over.
6-15	Serious setback. Louis III rallied or René of Anjou arrived with French forces. Queen Joanna changed her mind again. Calabrian barons wavering. Alfonso holding but losing momentum.
16-30	Stalled campaign. Progress has stopped. Italian powers intervening diplomatically. Sforza demanding more money. Winter slowed operations. Alfonso controls some territory but faces determined resistance.
31-45	Holding gains. Alfonso maintains the progress from autumn but hasn't advanced much. Louis III still alive but fading. Queen Joanna still negotiating. The situation remains fluid.
46-60	Steady progress. Alfonso continues to consolidate. More barons declare for Aragon. Louis III has died or is clearly finished. Queen Joanna leaning toward formal adoption.
61-75	Strong position. Alfonso controls most of Calabria and is advancing on Naples itself. Queen Joanna has formally adopted him (again). Louis III dead, René of Anjou unable to respond effectively. Coronation possible within months.
76-85	Dominant position. Alfonso controls the south and has entered Naples. Queen Joanna has named him heir. Only scattered Angevin resistance remains. Coronation imminent or already occurred.
86-95	Victory in sight. Alfonso has effectively won. Naples is his. René of Anjou has no realistic path to contest. Italian powers accepting the new reality. Crown secure.
96-100	Complete triumph. Something extraordinary—perhaps René of Anjou himself captured, or a diplomatic masterstroke that removes all opposition. Alfonso's position unassailable.
Ready to roll when you give the word.

Oh no! Rolled 1. What on earth is happening? 

The table suggests multiple outcomes who are varied. An outcome where Alfonso is killed is very different from just a naval defeat or something else.

DISASTER SUB-TABLE: What Went Wrong in Naples?

A roll of 1 indicates catastrophe—but the nature of that catastrophe matters enormously. Roll again to determine specifically what has happened:

Roll	Specific Disaster
1-15	Alfonso killed. Battle, assassination, or illness. The King of Aragon is dead. María is a widow. The three-kingdom alliance collapses. Aragon itself faces succession crisis.
16-35	Alfonso captured. Naval battle or ambush. Alfonso is prisoner—of Genoa, Milan, or the Angevins. Massive ransom demanded. His campaign is frozen, his kingdom scrambling.
36-50	Catastrophic betrayal. Queen Joanna reversed her adoption, or Sforza switched sides, or the Calabrian barons turned coat en masse. Alfonso's position has collapsed. He may have fled Naples entirely.
51-65	French intervention. René of Anjou arrived with a French army. Alfonso's forces crushed in battle. He's alive but his army is shattered. Years of work undone.
66-80	Naval disaster. The Aragonese fleet destroyed—by Genoa, by storm, or by combined Italian action. Alfonso cut off from reinforcement and supply. Trapped in hostile territory.
81-95	Papal reversal. Pope Eugenius IV, under pressure from French cardinals or Italian powers, has withdrawn support for Alfonso's claim. The diplomatic foundation of the campaign has crumbled.
96-100	Multiple disasters. Two or more of the above have occurred in combination. The situation is worse than anyone imagined possible.
Roll again to determine the specific nature of the disaster.

Orchestrated military upheaval derailing diplomatic ambitions





FRENCH INTERVENTION: The Disaster Revealed

The harbormaster's nervous demeanor makes more sense now. As Juan's party makes their way from the docks toward Castel Nuovo, the signs of crisis become unmistakable.

The streets of Naples are tense. Armed men in Aragonese colors patrol in groups, watching rooftops and alleyways. Merchants have shuttered early. Women hurry children indoors. The atmosphere is not that of a city preparing for victory—it is the brittle quiet of a city bracing for siege.

At the gates of Castel Nuovo, a harried official recognizes the Castilian royal standard and nearly weeps with relief.

"Your Majesty of Castile! Thank God. Thank God you've come."

He ushers Juan's party through the gates with unseemly haste, barking orders for King Alfonso to be informed immediately.

In the courtyard, wounded men sit against walls, being tended by surgeons. Their bandages are fresh—days old, not weeks. A cluster of knights in battered armor speak in low, angry voices. One has his arm in a sling. Another bears a half-healed gash across his face.

The official speaks rapidly as he leads Juan toward the keep:

"His Majesty King Alfonso lives, praise God. But the battle at Aversa, two weeks past—" He crosses himself. "René of Anjou. The French came with ten thousand men. Perhaps more. We thought Louis was the threat, but Louis died in November and his brother..." He shakes his head. "His brother brought an army."

The official leads Juan deeper into the castle. What does Juan do?

Where is Alfonso? I must speak with him.

10 dec 2025

Orchestrated narrative meeting while analyzing protagonist's psychological state post-defeat








"His Majesty is in the war chamber, Your Majesty. He has barely slept since—" The official catches himself. "He will wish to see you. This way."

They climb stone stairs, past guards who look exhausted and grim. The castle feels like a wound—men moving with the careful urgency of those managing crisis, voices low, faces drawn.

The war chamber doors open.

Alfonso V of Aragon stands at a table covered with maps, correspondence, and the detritus of desperate planning. He is forty years old, but today he looks older. His clothes are fine but rumpled, as though he dressed without the aid of servants. Dark circles rim his eyes. His jaw is shadowed with several days' growth.

When he sees Juan, something shifts in his face—relief, shame, and calculation flickering in rapid succession before settling into a careful mask.

"Juan." His voice is hoarse. "You've heard, then."

He waves away the attendants. The doors close, leaving the two kings alone in the chamber. Through the window, the bay of Naples glitters in the afternoon light—beautiful and indifferent to the ambitions of men.

Alfonso does not move from behind the table. His hands rest on a map of the Italian peninsula, fingers splayed as though holding the parchment down by force of will.

He waits for Juan to speak first.

Alfonso watches Juan, guarded and wary.

I heard de Anjou brought an army and that you were defeated.

10 dec 2025

Calibrated proud character's defensive response to military defeat




Alfonso's jaw tightens. For a moment, pride wars with necessity on his face.

"Defeated." He tastes the word like poison. "Yes. Defeated."

He turns away, moving to the window, presenting his back to Juan. When he speaks again, his voice is flat—the monotone of a man reciting facts to avoid feeling them.

"Louis died in November. We thought that was the end of it. The Angevins had no army here, no money, no support. Queen Joanna was ready to sign the adoption. The Calabrian barons were with me. I held Reggio, Catanzaro, half the south. Sforza's condottieri were marching north toward Naples itself."

He pauses.

"Then René came."

Alfonso turns back, and now there is something raw in his expression—the baffled fury of a man who did everything right and still lost.

"Ten thousand men. French knights, Provençal infantry, Genoese crossbowmen. He landed at Gaeta in January with a fleet we never saw coming. Genoa—" He spits the name. "Genoa provided the ships. Milan provided the money. They'd rather see a French puppet on the Naples throne than an Aragonese king controlling the western Mediterranean."

He moves back to the table, jabbing a finger at the map.

"Aversa. Two weeks ago. Sforza's men broke. Broke." The word cracks with disbelief. "The finest condottieri in Italy, and they broke against French heavy cavalry. René's knights went through them like paper. I lost two thousand men in an afternoon. The rest scattered. Sforza himself fled to Milan to renegotiate his contract—with René."

Alfonso's hand curls into a fist on the map.

"I hold Naples. This city, this castle, and perhaps a dozen miles in any direction. The barons who swore to me are 'reconsidering their positions.' Queen Joanna has gone silent. And René of Anjou sits at Aversa with an army I cannot match, waiting for me to starve or surrender."

He looks at Juan directly now.

"So yes. Defeated."

Alfonso stands rigid, waiting for Juan's response. His pride is cracked but not broken—he has not yet asked for help.

How is he able to sustain such a large campain and for so long? Does he indeed have such deep pockets?

10 dec 2025

Examined René's financial backing through allied support networks




Alfonso laughs bitterly.

"René? Deep pockets?" He shakes his head. "The man was ransoming his own jewelry to pay debts three years ago. Duke of Anjou, Duke of Bar, Duke of Lorraine through his wife—titles enough for three kings, and barely the income of a prosperous count."

He leans over the map, tracing lines with his finger.

"No. René is the sword. Others provide the arm."

He taps Genoa. "The Genoese hate me. Hate Aragon. We threaten their trade routes, their dominance in the western sea. They provided the fleet that brought René's army—forty ships, Juan. Forty. And they didn't do it for love of France."

His finger moves to Milan. "Filippo Maria Visconti. The snake of Milan." Alfonso's voice drips contempt. "He funded Sforza to fight for me, then funded René to fight against me. He plays all sides, always. A strong Aragon in Naples threatens his ambitions in Lombardy. A weak French puppet he can manipulate? That serves him perfectly."

He straightens, folding his arms.

"Between them—Genoa's ships, Milan's gold—René has what he needs. For now. But such coalitions are fragile. Visconti will betray René the moment it suits him, just as he betrayed me. The question is whether I survive long enough to see it."

Alfonso hesitates, then adds more quietly:

"There are also whispers about French gold directly. Charles VII is no longer the desperate dauphin hiding behind Joan of Arc's skirts. France recovers. And René is married to Charles's sister-in-law. The French crown may see Naples as worth an investment."

He meets Juan's eyes.

"I am not fighting one man, Juan. I am fighting half of Italy and perhaps France itself. And right now, I am losing."

Alfonso waits, his pride cracking further with each admission.

What is the naval situation? Can we reinforce Naples from Iberia? Can I land a Castillian army?

10 dec 2025

Assessed naval capabilities and strategic reinforcement feasibility realistically




Alfonso moves to the window overlooking the bay, where the masts of ships are visible in the harbor.

"My fleet survives. Mostly." He counts on his fingers. "Fourteen war galleys. Eight armed carracks. Some smaller vessels. They're anchored here, under the castello's guns. René has no fleet of his own in these waters—the Genoese returned home after landing his army. They're merchants, not soldiers. They delivered their cargo and left."

He turns back, a flicker of strategic calculation returning to his eyes.

"The sea is... contested but not closed. Genoese raiders harry the approaches. They took two of my supply ships last month. But they cannot blockade Naples. Not with what they have here." He gestures southward. "The route from Sicily remains open. My brother controls Palermo. Grain still reaches us."

Alfonso studies the map again, tracing the sea route from Iberia.

"From Castile? From Aragon?" He considers. "The voyage is long. A thousand miles from Barcelona. Fifteen hundred from Seville. Through waters where Genoa is strong—the Balearics, Sardinia, the Tyrrhenian. An army would need transport ships, escort vessels, supplies for weeks at sea."

He looks at Juan directly.

"Could you land a Castilian army? Yes. In theory. But how large? How soon?" His voice is careful now, probing. "René has ten thousand men. To break him in the field, I would need... eight thousand? Ten? Fresh, well-supplied, well-led. And time to coordinate, to plan, to strike before Visconti sends more gold or Genoa sends more ships."

Alfonso's hands rest on the table.

"You have ten ships in my harbor, Juan. Knights enough to hold a wall, not storm a field. What exactly are you asking? What are you offering?"

Alfonso watches Juan carefully. The question beneath the question: How far will Castile go for this alliance?

I dont know, I am just probing. 

What will this mean for your position here? What are you going to do?

10 dec 2025

Weighed Alfonso's pride against realistic survival options






Alfonso exhales slowly. He moves to a chair and sits heavily, the first time he has allowed himself to show physical exhaustion since Juan entered.

"What am I going to do." He repeats the question as though testing its weight.

For a long moment, he is silent. When he speaks, it is with the careful deliberation of a man who has spent sleepless nights considering every path.

"I have three choices."

He raises one finger. "First. I hold Naples and wait. René's coalition is unnatural—Genoa and Milan despise each other. Visconti is already negotiating with Florence against Genoa's interests. Given time, they will turn on each other. They always do." He shakes his head. "But time requires food, gold, and men. I have perhaps two months of supplies. My treasury is nearly empty. And every week I sit here, more barons abandon me for René."

A second finger. "Second. I negotiate. René is not unreasonable. He might accept my withdrawal in exchange for... something. Recognition of his claim. Perhaps some territorial concession in Sicily or Sardinia. I go home to Aragon with my life and my fleet, and I abandon twelve years of work."

His voice hardens on the last words.

A third finger. "Third. I withdraw to Sicily. Regroup. My brother holds Palermo. The island is loyal. I could rebuild, wait for René's coalition to collapse, return in a year or two or five." He laughs without humor. "My father spent twenty years fighting for this crown. Perhaps I am meant to spend twenty more."

Alfonso leans back, studying Juan.

"What this means for my position? It means I am not yet defeated, but I am not far from it. It means the three-kingdom alliance we dreamed of in Granada is... delayed. Perhaps for years. Perhaps forever."

He pauses.

"Unless something changes."

Alfonso does not ask directly. His pride will not permit it. But the question hangs in the air between them.

What about Joanna? How is her health?

10 dec 2025

Assessed elderly ruler's health relevance to succession crisis






Alfonso's expression shifts—a glimmer of dark amusement.

"Joanna." He pronounces the name with the weariness of a man who has spent years trying to predict an unpredictable woman. "She is sixty-one years old. She has outlived two husbands, three adopted heirs, and countless predictions of her imminent death."

He rises, moving back to the map, tapping Naples itself.

"Her health? Failing. She does not leave the Castel Capuano. Her physicians attend her constantly. Some say it is her heart. Others say her lungs. She coughs blood, they whisper." He shrugs. "She has been 'dying' for five years. And yet she persists."

Alfonso's finger traces the short distance between Castel Nuovo and Castel Capuano—two fortresses in the same city, two monarchs in opposition.

"She adopted me in 1421. Revoked it in 1423 for Louis. Was negotiating to restore it when René arrived." His jaw tightens. "Now she waits. She has always waited—playing suitors against each other, never committing until the last possible moment. It is how she has survived."

He turns to face Juan.

"If she dies without naming an heir, Naples descends into chaos—every faction fighting for the crown. If she names René, his position becomes unassailable. If she names me..." He laughs bitterly. "She will not name me while René sits at Aversa with ten thousand men and I cower behind these walls."

Alfonso's voice drops.

"Joanna respects strength. She adopted me when I was ascendant. She abandoned me when Louis seemed stronger. Now René holds the field." He spreads his hands. "Why would she choose the losing side?"

The question lingers: what would it take to make Alfonso no longer look like the losing side?

It's time for Castille to enter this war. If you would accept it. 

I will sail on to Constantinople and I will write my regent to raise an army to come to Sicily. The Genoese have no reason to fight a christian army on it's way to Sicily. Only when they have arrived do I declare officially. When I have returned from Constantinople, the Castillian army will have arrived. Then we land, strike and end this war. And we cement the three crowns alliance in blood if needed.

10 dec 2025

Weighed Alfonso's pride against strategic necessity and calculated implications









Alfonso goes very still.

For a long moment, he simply stares at Juan. The mask of careful diplomacy, the shield of wounded pride—both slip, revealing something raw beneath. Hope. Desperate, dangerous hope.

He opens his mouth, closes it. Turns away toward the window. His shoulders rise and fall with a deep breath.

When he turns back, his eyes are wet, though no tears fall.

"You would do this." His voice is rough. "Commit Castile to war in Italy. For me. For Naples."

He moves back to the table, leaning on it with both hands, studying the map as though seeing it anew.

"The timing... yes. The Genoese cannot justify attacking a Christian fleet bound for Constantinople. By the time your army reaches Sicily, René will have grown complacent. His coalition will have frayed. And then..."

Alfonso looks up sharply.

"How many men? An army large enough to break René in the field—eight thousand? Ten? Castile has strength, but your Military Orders have obligations, your nobles have their own concerns. And the cost—" He shakes his head. "Transporting an army across the Mediterranean is ruinously expensive. Feeding them, supplying them, paying them while they wait..."

He straightens, and now there is something else in his expression. Wariness.

"What do you want, Juan?"

The question is quiet but direct.

"We spoke in Granada of alliance. Of three kingdoms united. But this—" He gestures at the map. "This is not alliance. This is salvation. You would be rescuing the King of Aragon from his own failed war. That is not a debt easily repaid."

Alfonso watches Juan, waiting. He needs to understand the price before he can accept the gift.

This will however unite our kingdoms and our family. I have spent some time in Barcelona and everyone seems to be talking about the Aragonese succession. That I am the next in line. 

I have never sproken about this with you personally. How can we prevent another succession war not only for Aragon but for Naples as well?

Analyzed Alfonso's emotional vulnerabilities and crafted nuanced reaction table










NPC ANALYSIS: Alfonso V's Reaction

What does Alfonso want?

To win Naples—his life's obsession
An heir of his own blood (impossible—his marriage to María is childless after many years)
To be remembered as a great king, not a failure
Dignity, even in defeat
To not feel like he's selling his legacy for rescue
What won't Alfonso say?

That his childlessness is a source of profound grief and shame
That he has thought about this succession question constantly
That watching Juan—younger, successful, with two healthy children—produces complicated emotions
That being saved by his brother-in-law while discussing inheritance feels like a transaction, not a gift
Identity Stakes: Extreme. Juan is touching the rawest wound—Alfonso's lack of heir, the impermanence of everything he's building.

The Approach: Juan is being practical and direct. He's offering massive military aid while also raising succession—which is strategically sensible but personally delicate. The timing (when Alfonso is desperate) could read as opportunistic or as genuine concern. Alfonso will have to decide which.

D100 TABLE: Alfonso's Reaction to Succession Discussion

Roll	Reaction
1-10	Wounded fury. Alfonso hears this as an insult—Juan offering to "save" him while already measuring the crown for his own head. Pride overwhelms pragmatism. He responds coldly, perhaps even rejects the military aid. The alliance fractures at its most critical moment.
11-25	Bitter suspicion. Alfonso masks his pain with cold diplomacy. He accepts Juan's offer but makes clear he sees the transaction beneath the charity. "You will have it all eventually. Why pretend otherwise?" The conversation ends without resolution on succession. Trust damaged.
26-40	Guarded deflection. Alfonso acknowledges the succession question but refuses to engage deeply. "Let us win the war first. Then we can discuss what comes after." He accepts military aid but walls off the personal dimension. Practical cooperation without emotional resolution.
41-55	Painful honesty. Alfonso admits the childlessness is a wound he cannot heal. He does not resolve the succession question but shares his grief openly—a moment of vulnerability between brothers-in-law. No formal agreement, but mutual understanding deepens.
56-70	Pragmatic acceptance. Alfonso sets aside pride and engages the question seriously. He acknowledges Juan as likely heir and begins discussing how to manage the transition—not a formal agreement, but genuine strategic conversation. Foundation laid for future arrangement.
71-85	Relieved gratitude. Alfonso has been carrying this burden alone. Having Juan raise it openly—combined with the offer of military aid—breaks through his defenses. He speaks freely about his fears, his hopes, his desire to see Aragon and Castile united properly. Real partnership emerges.
86-95	Strategic vision. Alfonso seizes the moment. He proposes concrete arrangements—formal recognition of Juan as heir, joint governance structures, how Naples fits into the union. The conversation shifts from rescue to legacy-building. Alfonso finds purpose beyond his own reign.
96-100	Transformation. Something profound shifts. Alfonso sees this not as his failure but as God's plan—the three kingdoms united under Juan, his own life's work as foundation rather than monument. He embraces Juan not as a desperate man accepting charity, but as a brother passing a torch.
Ready to roll when you give the word.

10 dec 2025

Calibrated pragmatic character response balancing dignity with strategic negotiation





Alfonso is silent for a long moment. His hand moves absently to the edge of the map, fingers tracing the coastline of Aragon as though touching something precious.

When he speaks, his voice is quieter than before. The bluster is gone.

"You know, when I was young, I thought I would have sons." He does not look at Juan. "Many sons. An heir for Aragon. An heir for Sicily. An heir for Naples, when I won it. A dynasty to rival the Capetians."

He exhales slowly.

"María and I... we tried. For years. The physicians, the pilgrimages, the prayers." A muscle twitches in his jaw. "Nothing. And now she is past the age. There will be no sons of my body."

Alfonso finally looks up, meeting Juan's eyes. The mask is not entirely gone—he is still a king, still proud—but there are cracks in it now.

"Everyone talks of it. Barcelona, Valencia, Zaragoza, Palermo. They look at me and they see a king without an heir. They look at you and they see..." He gestures vaguely. "Granada. Constantinople. Two healthy children. A young wife who may give you more."

He moves around the table, closer to Juan.

"I am not a fool, Juan. I know what the lawyers say. I know the genealogies. If I die without legitimate issue, the Crown of Aragon passes to your line through your mother." He pauses. "And if I win Naples and then die without issue, Naples becomes... complicated."

Alfonso leans against the table, arms folded.

"So. You offer me an army. You raise the succession. These are not separate things in your mind, I think."

It is not an accusation. His tone is measured, probing.

"What are you proposing, exactly? That we formalize what the lawyers already assume? That we bind Naples to the arrangement somehow?" He tilts his head. "I am not opposed to discussing this. I would rather my life's work pass to you than be torn apart by squabbling cousins and Angevin pretenders."

He holds up a hand.

"But I am also not a man who signs documents while a French army sits ten miles from his walls. Such agreements would look like... coercion. My nobles would question whether I acted freely. Your nobles would wonder what you promised to extract such terms."

Alfonso straightens.

"Win this war with me first. Fight beside me, not merely for me. And when René is broken and Naples is secure—then we discuss how to bind our kingdoms together properly. In strength, not in desperation."

He extends his hand.

"Is that acceptable?"

Alfonso waits, his hand outstretched—an offer of partnership, but on terms that preserve his dignity.

I shake his hand. 

I dont want Naples to fall into war again. It deserves a clear succession. And it indeed fits into my vision for a christian alliance that can challenge the Ottomans. 

Let us first win you the crown of Naples cousin. And with me on the field, we shall not fail. 

I summon a scribe and dictate a letter to Alvaro. He is to raise an army of 15.000 Castillians consisting of noble and crown troops and to ferry them to sicily. Put the Mendoza's in overall command of the army. The army is to assemble in Sicily and await my return from Constantinople. I leave the objective out of the letter. The army is simply to assemble in Sicily and await my command.

10 dec 2025

Orchestrated military logistics and strategic secrecy for Naples campaign






Alfonso grips Juan's hand firmly. Something passes between them—not quite brotherhood, not yet, but the foundation of it. An understanding.

"Cousin," Alfonso repeats, and there is warmth in the word now.

The Letter to Álvaro de Luna

A scribe is summoned—a nervous Aragonese clerk who was not expecting to take dictation from the King of Castile. He sets up his writing desk with trembling hands, quill poised.

Juan dictates:

To Don Álvaro de Luna, Royal Constable and Regent of Castile,

By the authority vested in me as King of Castile and León, I command the following:

You are to raise an army of fifteen thousand men, consisting of noble levies and crown troops, to be assembled with all haste. Don Íñigo López de Mendoza shall hold overall command of this force.

This army is to be transported by sea to the island of Sicily, there to assemble and await my return from Constantinople. The fleet required for transport shall be contracted from Castilian, Aragonese, and other Christian sources as necessary.

The purpose of this assembly shall be revealed upon my arrival. Until such time, the army is to maintain discipline, conduct training exercises, and preserve good relations with the local authorities in Sicily.

Speed is essential. I expect the army to be assembled in Sicily no later than [Juan can specify a date or leave it to Álvaro's judgment].

Given at Naples, this 26th day of March, in the year of our Lord 1434.

Juan, by the Grace of God King of Castile and León

The scribe looks up, quill hovering.

"The date for assembly, Your Majesty? And shall I note anything regarding funding for such an enterprise?"

Alfonso, meanwhile, has gone very still. Fifteen thousand men. He had asked for eight, perhaps ten. Juan has offered half again more.

Does Juan wish to add anything to the letter?

The nobles will be assembling as is their noble obligation. Supplies and transport will be provided by the crown treasury. 

Assemble te men in Palermo in July 1434.

10 dec 2025

Assessed logistical feasibility of massive military mobilization campaign






The scribe nods, writing quickly. The quill scratches across parchment, recording the commands that will set fifteen thousand men in motion across a thousand miles of sea.

"...supplies and transport to be provided by the crown treasury. The army shall assemble at Palermo no later than July of this year, fourteen hundred and thirty-four."

He finishes with a flourish, sands the ink, and presents the letter for Juan's seal.

Alfonso watches in silence as the wax is heated, as Juan's signet ring presses into the crimson blob, as the letter that may decide the fate of three kingdoms is folded and prepared for dispatch.

"July," Alfonso says quietly. "Four months. That is... ambitious."

He moves to a cabinet, produces a sealed document of his own.

"A letter of passage for your messenger. It will get him through any Aragonese territory without delay. My fastest couriers can have this in Barcelona within a week. From there to Toledo..."

He hands the document to the scribe, who bows and hurries from the chamber.

When the door closes, Alfonso turns back to Juan.

"Fifteen thousand men." He shakes his head slowly. "I asked for eight. Perhaps ten. You offer me an army larger than René's."

He pours two cups of wine from a flagon on the side table—simple clay cups, not the silver goblets a king would normally use. A sign of how strained resources have become.

"You understand what this means, Juan. If Castile sends fifteen thousand men to fight in Italy, you are not merely aiding an ally. You are declaring to all of Christendom that the Crown of Castile has interests in the Mediterranean. Genoa will see it. Milan will see it. Florence, Venice, the Pope himself." He offers one cup to Juan. "You will have enemies you did not have yesterday."

Alfonso raises his cup, waiting.

That was going to happen anyway if our alliance ever came into force. We will guard our islands and the northern Naples forts and we should be quite secure. The pope is our ally so that cuts off most of the approaches. We should maybe ally with Venice if Genoa appears our greatest enemy at sea.

10 dec 2025

Orchestrated diplomatic positioning and naval strategy across Mediterranean powers





Alfonso drinks, then sets down his cup with a thoughtful expression.

"Venice." He rolls the word around like a merchant testing a coin. "Yes. The Serenissima hates Genoa—they have been rivals for centuries. And they fear Milan more than anyone. Visconti's ambitions in Lombardy threaten their mainland territories."

He moves back to the map, finger tracing the Adriatic coast.

"But Venice is... careful. They calculate everything. They will not commit to an alliance unless they see clear profit." He taps the eastern Mediterranean. "Their interests lie here. Constantinople. The Black Sea trade. The Aegean islands. They watch the Ottomans with one eye and their account books with the other."

Alfonso glances at Juan.

"You sail to Constantinople. That may open doors. If you can persuade the Venetians that a strong Christian presence in the eastern Mediterranean serves their commercial interests..." He shrugs. "They are not sentimental, but they are pragmatic. Gold speaks louder than crusading rhetoric in the Doge's palace."

He straightens, folding his arms.

"As for the Pope—yes, Eugenius supports us. But Rome is not a fortress. The papal states are weak, surrounded by powers that would happily see the Holy Father humbled. Eugenius can write letters and issue bulls. He cannot field armies." Alfonso's voice carries a note of hard-won wisdom. "Do not rely too heavily on papal favor. It is valuable but fragile. What the Pope gives today, pressure may force him to withdraw tomorrow."

He drains the last of his wine.

"The northern approaches—Gaeta, Terracina, the coastal fortresses—yes, those must be held. If René is driven south and we control the north, he is trapped between our armies and the sea."

Alfonso looks at Juan directly.

"But all of this assumes you return from Constantinople. The Turks are not French knights, Juan. They are something else entirely. How long do you intend to stay in the East?"

Alfonso waits, genuine concern beneath the strategic questioning.

I will return in July to lead our campain against the Anjou. We will succeed. 

And interestingly, our interest in helping the Byzantines creates Venice as a natural ally as our interests align. 

I will return cousin. Dont worry.

10 dec 2025

Analyzed Alfonso's unspoken anxieties and orchestrated dignified conversation closure






Alfonso holds Juan's gaze for a long moment. Whatever he sees there seems to satisfy him—or at least quiet his fears enough to set them aside.

"July." He nods slowly. "I will hold until July. René expects me to starve or surrender. He will learn that Aragonese stubbornness is not so easily broken."

A ghost of his old confidence returns to his voice. The desperate man who greeted Juan an hour ago is still there, but buried now beneath renewed purpose.

"Venice, Constantinople, the alignment of interests—yes, I see it. You think like an emperor, cousin. Not merely of battles, but of the shape of the world." There is no mockery in the words. If anything, a note of respect. "I confess I have spent so long staring at this map of Italy that I forgot there was a larger board."

He sets down his cup and straightens, assuming again the bearing of a king rather than a supplicant.

"You have given me hope, Juan. And an army. I will not squander either."

Alfonso glances toward the window. The afternoon light is fading.

"But enough of war and politics for one hour. You have sailed from Rome with your family aboard, yes? Your wife and daughter?" He gestures vaguely toward the harbor. "My own queen will want to meet them. María has spoken of little else since we received word you were coming to Italy—her brother, the crusader king."

His expression softens slightly.

"She has been... lonely, these past months. The campaign has consumed me. A visit from family would do her good."

Alfonso waits to hear Juan's plans—how long he intends to stay in Naples, and whether he will bring Lucia and Catalina ashore.

GM: Maria is in Barcelona where I have met her. She is not with her husband. 

Cousin, you can help my fleet practice on what to do when they encounter Ottoman fleets. You have captains with experience? I would like to invite them onboard so we may learn.

Corrected geographical error and recalibrated character positioning






Alfonso blinks, momentarily confused, then shakes his head.

"Forgive me. The lack of sleep." He rubs his eyes. "María remains in Barcelona, of course. Managing affairs while I chase crowns across the sea. She writes that she prays for me daily. I sometimes wonder if her prayers are all that keep this enterprise from complete ruin."

He sets aside the brief flash of vulnerability and focuses on Juan's question.

"Captains with Ottoman experience." Alfonso considers. "Not many who have fought them directly—the Turks have not troubled our waters in force. But I have men who have sailed the eastern Mediterranean. Who have seen Turkish galleys, studied their tactics, spoken with Venetian and Hospitaller captains who have clashed with them."

He moves to the door and calls for an attendant.

"Send for Admiral Berenguer. And Captain Torrelles, if he is not on patrol."

Turning back to Juan, he continues: "Berenguer commanded my fleet at Ponza—yes, the disaster, but he survived it and learned from it. He knows how to fight galleys against galleys. Torrelles spent three years running cargo to Cyprus and Rhodes before the war. He has seen Ottoman naval formations firsthand."

Alfonso's expression sharpens with strategic interest.

"The Turks fight differently than we do. Faster ships, more archers, different boarding tactics. If your fleet is to operate near Constantinople, your captains must understand what they will face."

He pauses.

"How long can you remain in Naples? A few days of joint exercises would teach your men more than weeks of drilling alone."

Alfonso waits for Juan's answer.

I will stay a few days to exercise and re-supply. 

I stay in Naples for a few days and perform exercises.

Architected training scenario accounting for fleet inexperience and time constraints



CHAOS ROLL: Naval Exercises at Naples

Duration: 3-4 days Focus: Ottoman naval tactics, galley combat, boarding defense Resources: Aragonese Admiral Berenguer (Ponza veteran), Captain Torrelles (eastern Mediterranean experience), Alfonso's remaining fleet for joint maneuvers

Factors in Play:

Castilian crews still learning, especially carrack sailors
Recent corsair encounter exposed weaknesses but also built some cohesion
Aragonese captains have relevant experience but are demoralized from recent defeats
Naples harbor is secure but the city is effectively under siege—exercises must stay close
Time is limited; only a few days before Constantinople departure
Joint Castilian-Aragonese operations could build alliance or expose tensions
Roll	Outcome
1-5	Disaster. A serious accident during exercises—Loss of a ship or significant casualties. The tragedy poisons morale and cooperation.
6-15	Failure. The exercises go poorly. Cultural friction between Castilian and Aragonese crews. Conflicting methods create confusion rather than learning. Fleet departs no better prepared than before.
16-30	Disappointing. Limited progress. Aragonese captains struggle to convey lessons effectively, or Castilian crews resist unfamiliar tactics. Some useful knowledge gained, but less than hoped.
31-45	Adequate. Basic competence achieved. Crews learn the fundamentals of Ottoman tactics and counter-measures. Nothing remarkable, but the time was not wasted.
46-60	Solid progress. The exercises prove valuable. Crews internalize key lessons about Turkish galleys, archer screens, and ramming tactics. Confidence improves. Captain Vargas reports genuine advancement.
61-75	Strong results. Aragonese experience meshes well with Castilian discipline. Joint maneuvers reveal effective tactics. Crews bond across national lines. Fleet departs significantly better prepared for eastern waters.
76-85	Excellent training. A breakthrough in coordination and understanding. Admiral Berenguer's hard-won lessons from Ponza transform how Castilian captains think about naval combat. Real readiness for Ottoman encounters.
86-95	Exceptional. The exercises become a model of allied cooperation. Castilian and Aragonese crews develop genuine camaraderie. Specific tactical innovations emerge. Fleet cohesion rivals veteran squadrons.
96-100	Remarkable. Something unexpected—perhaps a captured corsair vessel to practice against, or intelligence about Ottoman dispositions, or a Hospitaller captain passing through who shares invaluable expertise. The fleet is transformed.

Orchestrated excellent naval training outcomes and prepared narrative progression


Naples Harbor and Coastal Waters, March 27-30, 1434

Day One: Admiral Berenguer

Admiral Berenguer is not what Juan expected. A stocky man in his fifties, grey-bearded and weathered, he carries himself with the particular stillness of someone who has survived catastrophe and emerged harder for it.

"Ponza," he says flatly, when they meet on the deck of the Santa Catalina. "Your Majesty wants to know about Ponza. Everyone does. The great defeat."

He does not wait for confirmation.

"We lost because we fought like Christians against Christians. Line abreast, close and board, prize-taking and ransom." He spits over the rail. "The Genoese fought to sink us. We fought to capture them. A man fighting to kill will always defeat a man fighting to profit."

He turns to face Juan's assembled captains—Vargas, the captain of the San Marcos, the carrack commanders, even old Pascual who has somehow earned a place in these councils.

"The Turks are worse. They do not want your ships. They do not want ransom. They want you dead or enslaved. Every man. Every vessel. No quarter, no negotiation, no chivalry." His eyes are hard. "Forget everything you know about naval warfare. I will teach you how to survive."

Day Two: Galley Tactics

The exercises begin at dawn. Alfonso has lent four of his war galleys for the drills, their crews demonstrating Ottoman formations while Castilian ships practice responses.

Berenguer stands beside Juan on the flagship's quarterdeck, narrating as the galleys sweep in.

"The Turkish formation—see how they spread wide? They want to envelop. Pin you with the center while the wings curl around. Their archers suppress your deck crews while they close for ramming." He points. "There—that's your death. The moment you're surrounded, you're finished. They'll board from three sides at once."

The Castilian carracks lumber through counter-maneuvers. It is ugly at first—signals missed, ships nearly colliding, curses flying across the water in three languages.

But by afternoon, something shifts. The carrack captains begin to understand how their heavier ships can use their bulk defensively, how to maintain formation, how to concentrate fire.

"Better," Berenguer grunts. It is the first word of praise he has offered.

Day Three: Captain Torrelles and Eastern Waters

Captain Torrelles is younger, leaner, with the quick eyes of a man who has spent years watching horizons for danger.

"The Turks are not one navy," he explains, spreading charts across the captain's table. "You have the Sultan's fleet—disciplined, well-supplied, dangerous. You have corsairs—independent raiders, unpredictable but poorly coordinated. And you have local squadrons loyal to various beys and pashas."

He traces the approaches to Constantinople.

"Here—the Dardanelles. The Turks control both shores. Any fleet approaching Constantinople must pass through waters they dominate. Night passage, or overwhelming force. There is no other way."

The Castilian captains absorb this grimly.

Torrelles continues: "But the Turks have weaknesses. Their galleys are fast but fragile. Your carracks can take punishment they cannot. Your cannons outrange their bows. If you hold formation—if you do not let them swarm you—you can hurt them badly."

Day Four: Joint Maneuvers

The final day brings everything together. Castilian and Aragonese ships operate as a combined fleet, running through scenarios Berenguer has designed: ambush responses, convoy defense, fighting withdrawal.

Captain Vargas finds Juan on deck as the sun sets over Naples.

"Your Majesty." The weathered captain looks different than he did four days ago. There is something sharper in his bearing. "I have sailed for thirty years. I thought I knew the sea."

He shakes his head.

"Berenguer has shown me I was a child playing at war. What we learned these four days..." He pauses, searching for words. "We are not ready to challenge the Sultan's fleet. But we are ready to survive it. To protect our convoy, to reach Constantinople, to fight our way out if we must."

He looks out at the fleet riding at anchor, lanterns beginning to glow in the twilight.

"The men feel it too. Castilian and Aragonese, drilling together—it means something. They see we are not alone in these waters."

Summary of Gains:

Crews trained in anti-galley tactics and Ottoman naval doctrine
Carrack captains understand how to use their vessels' strengths defensively
Practical experience with coordinated fleet maneuvers
Strong working relationship established between Castilian and Aragonese naval officers
Admiral Berenguer has offered to provide written tactical notes for the voyage
Captain Torrelles has marked charts with known Ottoman patrol patterns and safe harbors
Fleet morale significantly improved; crews feel genuinely prepared
The fleet is ready to depart for Constantinople. Does Juan wish to do anything else before sailing?

We sail for Constantinople!

Architected Mediterranean voyage framework with hazard considerations








CHAOS ROLL: Naples to Constantinople

Distance: ~1,200-1,500 nautical miles Expected journey: 2-3 weeks depending on conditions and route Route: Naples → Strait of Messina → Ionian Sea → Greek waters → Aegean → Dardanelles → Constantinople Season: Late March/Early April 1434 (spring—generally favorable but changeable)

Factors in Play:

Ten ships, 581 knights, royal family aboard
Crews freshly trained in Ottoman tactics (excellent results)
Must pass through waters where Genoese, corsairs, and Ottomans operate
The Dardanelles are Ottoman-controlled—both shores
Possible friendly port: Rhodes (Knights Hospitaller)
Admiral Berenguer's tactical notes and Torrelles's charts aboard
Fleet morale high after Naples exercises
Roll	Outcome
1-5	Disaster. Ottoman fleet intercepts near the Dardanelles. Major engagement with significant losses. Ships sunk or captured. Royal family in danger. The Constantinople mission may end before it begins.
6-10	Severe crisis. Storm scatters the fleet, OR Ottoman patrol forces desperate night action, OR Genoese squadron attempts interception. Heavy losses possible. Fleet arrives broken and bloodied, if at all.
11-20	Serious trouble. Dangerous encounter—Ottoman galleys shadow and probe, or Genoese warships demand explanations, or corsairs attack stragglers. Combat likely. Losses possible. Fleet tested severely.
21-35	Difficult passage. Rough seas, contrary winds, tense moments passing Ottoman-held waters. One or more ships damaged or delayed. Nerves frayed. Supplies strained. Fleet arrives intact but exhausted.
36-50	Uneventful but tense. The voyage passes without major incident, but every horizon brings anxiety. Ottoman sails spotted but no engagement. The Dardanelles passage is nerve-wracking. Fleet arrives intact, crews relieved.
51-65	Smooth sailing. Favorable winds, calm seas, no hostile encounters. The training holds—crews perform well. Brief stop at Rhodes for resupply goes smoothly. Fleet arrives in good order.
66-80	Good fortune. Excellent conditions throughout. Intelligence gathered at Rhodes about Ottoman dispositions. Dardanelles passage timed perfectly. Fleet arrives fresh and confident. Reputation precedes them.
81-90	Exceptional voyage. Everything aligns. Hospitaller escort through dangerous waters, OR Ottoman fleet occupied elsewhere, OR valuable diplomatic contact made en route. Fleet arrives in excellent condition with unexpected advantages.
91-95	Remarkable success. A significant opportunity presents itself—perhaps a Venetian alliance contact, or critical intelligence about Constantinople's situation, or an encounter that builds Juan's reputation in the East before he even arrives.
96-100	Providence. Something extraordinary occurs. The voyage becomes legend—a sign that God favors this mission. The fleet arrives transformed, and Constantinople receives them as deliverers.
Ready to roll when you give the word.

You have generated things that may have happened after Juan has had a chance to respond. The lowest result would be "attacked by muslims" or something. Then Juan reacts and we play out this encounter. The fact we encounter ships does not automatically mean disaster.

10 dec 2025

Recognized need to restructure encounter tables for player agency


You're absolutely right. I apologize. The table should present situations that Juan can respond to, not predetermined outcomes. Let me redraft:

CHAOS ROLL: Naples to Constantinople - What Does the Fleet Encounter?

Roll	Encounter
1-5	Ottoman war fleet. A significant Turkish naval force—perhaps a dozen or more galleys—sights the Castilian fleet near the Dardanelles. Battle stations. Juan must decide how to respond.
6-15	Ottoman patrol squadron. A smaller group of Turkish galleys (4-6 ships) moves to intercept or investigate. Intentions unclear. Tense standoff developing.
16-25	Genoese warships. A Genoese squadron bars the path or shadows the fleet aggressively. They may be hostile, may demand tolls, may be probing for weakness. Confrontation brewing.
26-35	Corsair attack. Barbary or Turkish corsairs (3-5 fast galleys) spot the fleet and move in, testing defenses.
36-45	Severe weather. A storm catches the fleet in open water. Ships scattered, navigation difficult. Crews tested.
46-55	Tense passage. Ottoman sails on the horizon near the Dardanelles. They watch but do not approach—yet. Every decision matters.
56-70	Uneventful voyage. Fair winds, calm seas, no significant encounters. The fleet reaches Constantinople without incident.
71-80	Smooth passage with opportunity. Good sailing, and something favorable—friendly contact at Rhodes, useful intelligence, or advantageous timing through the straits.
81-90	Hospitaller assistance. The Knights of Rhodes offer escort, supplies, or critical information about Ottoman movements.
91-95	Diplomatic opportunity. A Venetian convoy, Byzantine vessel, or other contact presents unexpected possibilities.
96-100	Exceptional fortune. Something remarkable—Ottoman fleet called away, or a meeting that changes the strategic picture entirely.

Orchestrated severe weather encounter, paused for player response


The Ionian Sea, April 5, 1434 — Eight Days Out of Naples

The first week passes smoothly. The fleet rounds Sicily through the Strait of Messina without incident, the volcanic peak of Etna smoking lazily on the horizon as they slip through the narrow waters. The crews, still sharp from the Naples exercises, maintain formation with a discipline that makes Captain Vargas nod approvingly.

Lucia spends the days on deck when weather permits, watching the coastlines slide past—first Italy, then the scattered Greek islands. Catalina has become a favorite of the sailors, toddling across the deck with her wooden horse while weathered men soften into smiles.

On the eighth day, the sky begins to change.

Morning, April 5

Captain Vargas finds Juan at the rail, studying the horizon. To the northeast, the sky has taken on a bruised quality—yellows and purples bleeding together in a way that speaks of violence to come.

"Your Majesty." Vargas's voice is flat. "There's weather coming. Bad weather."

He points toward the discoloration.

"That's a Gregale building. Northeast wind—it comes down from the Balkans this time of year. When it hits..." He shakes his head. "We're two days from Rhodes, maybe three. Open water, no shelter."

The other ships of the fleet are visible across the swells, their captains surely seeing the same ominous sky.

"We have choices, Your Majesty." Vargas ticks them off on his fingers. "We run south, try to find shelter in Crete—but that's half a day's sailing and we may not make it before the storm hits. We heave to and ride it out here in open water—the ships can take it, but we'll be scattered to hell and back. Or we press northeast, try to outrun it to Rhodes."

He looks at Juan directly.

"The carracks are sturdy but slow. The galleys are fast but fragile in heavy seas. Whatever we do, we do it together or we lose ships trying."

The first gusts of wind are already picking up, tugging at cloaks and rigging.

The storm is perhaps two hours away. What does Juan do?

If we reach Crete, can we take shelter there? How risky is it if we sail for Rhodes?

10 dec 2025

Reconciled Mediterranean geography with storm dynamics and shelter viability









Vargas scratches his beard, glancing between the darkening sky and the distant southern horizon.

"Crete." He considers. "Good harbors on the north coast—Candia, Rethymno. Venetian-controlled, so we'd be welcome enough. If we turn south now, hard sail, we might—might—reach the coast before the worst hits. But it's close, Your Majesty. If the Gregale comes faster than I think, we're caught in open water with the wind on our beam. That's when ships roll."

He turns northeast, toward the threatening sky.

"Rhodes is different. We'd be sailing into the wind. A Gregale blows from the northeast—we'd be fighting it the whole way. The galleys would suffer badly. Oars don't work well when the sea's trying to climb over your bow." He shakes his head. "Two, three days of that? We'd arrive exhausted, if we arrived at all. Some of the carracks might manage it. The galleys..." He makes a noncommittal gesture.

Vargas steps closer, lowering his voice.

"If you want my honest counsel, Your Majesty—Crete is the safer gamble. It's closer, we'd have the wind behind us instead of against us, and Venetian ports won't turn away a Christian fleet in distress. But it is a gamble. If we don't make shelter in time..."

He lets the sentence hang.

"The third option remains. Heave to, batten down, ride it out here. We lose formation, probably lose a day or two regrouping afterward. But the ships survive—probably."

The wind is picking up. The decision cannot wait much longer.

We sail for Crete and wait it out there.

Architected probability table balancing storm peril and Cretan refuge outcomes




CHAOS ROLL: Racing the Gregale to Crete

Distance to nearest Cretan harbor: ~60-70 nautical miles Time before storm hits: ~2 hours (estimate) Conditions: Wind building from northeast, seas rising

Factors in Play:

Fleet must maintain cohesion—scattered ships are vulnerable ships
Carracks are slow but sturdy; galleys are fast but fragile in heavy weather
Wind will be on their beam (side) if storm catches them—dangerous for rolling
Venetian-controlled ports will offer shelter to Christian fleet
Royal family aboard the Santa Catalina
Crews well-drilled from Naples exercises—discipline may make the difference
Roll	Encounter
1-10	Storm catches the fleet in open water. The Gregale arrives faster than expected. Ships scattered, fighting for survival. Juan must respond as chaos unfolds.
11-25	Desperate final miles. The storm hits just as the coast comes into view. Some ships make harbor; others are caught in the approaches. Crisis at the harbor mouth.
26-40	Close call. Fleet reaches Cretan waters but the storm is upon them. Rough entry into harbor—Loss of some rigging or damage possible. All ships accounted for, but it was near.
41-55	Narrow success. The fleet makes Candia or Rethymno with perhaps an hour to spare. Ships battered by rising swells but intact. Crews exhausted but relieved.
56-70	Clean run. Good seamanship and favorable currents get the fleet to shelter comfortably ahead of the storm. Ships anchor safely as the Gregale howls outside the harbor.
71-85	Excellent timing. Fleet arrives with time to spare. Venetian harbor master impressed by the disciplined arrival. Opportunity for resupply and intelligence gathering while waiting out the storm.
86-95	Unexpected advantage. The run to Crete brings the fleet into contact with someone useful—a Venetian official, a merchant with news, or another Christian vessel with valuable information.
96-100	Fortune favors the bold. Something remarkable—perhaps the storm veers away, or an encounter in port changes the strategic situation entirely.

I bring Catalina on board and let her see the storm before it hits and together we marvel at the Lord's wrath.

10 dec 2025

Orchestrated dramatic storm scene and plotted fortuitous encounter






The Cretan Coast, April 5, 1434 — Afternoon

The fleet flies before the building wind, sails straining, bows cutting through swells that grow taller with each passing hour. The Cretan coastline emerges from the haze—brown hills, white villages, the promise of shelter.

But there is time yet. Perhaps an hour before the storm truly breaks.

Juan finds Catalina in the great cabin with Lucia and the ladies-in-waiting. The child looks up as her father enters, immediately reaching for him.

"Papá! Barcos moving fast!"

Juan carries her up to the quarterdeck. The wind whips at their clothes, carrying the salt-spray smell of the angry sea. To the northeast, the sky has become a wall of bruised darkness, shot through with flickers of distant lightning. The sea beneath it is the color of iron.

Catalina's eyes go wide.

"Grande," she whispers, clutching Juan's collar with one hand, her wooden horse with the other.

The storm is a living thing—a mountain of cloud and fury rolling across the water toward them. Even from this distance, they can see the white chaos where it meets the sea, the curtains of rain dragging across the waves.

"Dios," Catalina says solemnly. She has heard the word in church, knows it belongs to moments of awe.

The crew works around them, hauling lines, securing loose equipment, but more than one weathered sailor pauses to glance at the little princess watching the tempest with solemn wonder rather than fear.

"The Lord's wrath," Captain Vargas says quietly, appearing at Juan's elbow. "Or His mercy, depending on whether we make harbor." He points toward the approaching coastline. "Candia, Your Majesty. We'll make it. Perhaps half an hour to spare."

The Harbor of Candia, Late Afternoon

The fleet slides into the great Venetian harbor as the first true gusts of the Gregale begin to shriek. The sea walls of Candia rise around them—massive fortifications built to hold against Ottoman sieges, now sheltering ten Castilian ships from nature's assault.

Anchor chains rattle. Sails come down. And then the storm hits in earnest.

From the safety of the harbor, Juan watches the Gregale turn the open sea into a churning nightmare of white water and driving rain. The sound is tremendous—wind howling across the harbor mouth, waves crashing against the sea walls, rain hammering the deck like a thousand drums.

Catalina has fallen asleep against Juan's chest, exhausted by the excitement, undisturbed by the chaos outside.

The Unexpected Encounter

Within the hour, a Venetian harbor boat approaches the Santa Catalina despite the weather—oarsmen fighting the chop, a canopy barely protecting the passengers from the driving rain.

A official in Venetian colors climbs the rope ladder, sodden but dignified. Behind him comes a second figure—an older man in water-stained robes of Byzantine cut, his grey beard plastered to his chest.

The Venetian official bows formally.

"Your Majesty of Castile. I am Marco Contarini, deputy to the Governor of Candia. The Serenissima welcomes your fleet to shelter." His eyes flick to the Byzantine beside him. "And... fortune has provided an unusual coincidence. This gentleman arrived three days ago, bound eventually for Rome. When he heard a Castilian fleet had entered the harbor—a fleet flying crusader crosses—he begged to speak with you immediately."

The Byzantine steps forward. Despite his bedraggled appearance, he carries himself with the bearing of a man accustomed to courts.

"Your Majesty." His Castilian is accented but clear—learned, perhaps, from Spanish merchants in Constantinople. "I am Georgios Sphrantzes, protovestiarios to His Imperial Majesty John VIII Palaiologos."

He pauses, and something desperate flickers behind his formal composure.

"I carry letters for the Pope and the Christian kings. But God has placed you in my path first. The Emperor has spoken of you—the king who completed the Reconquista. The king who promised aid."

His voice drops.

"Your Majesty, Constantinople's situation has changed. I must tell you what has happened before you sail into those waters."

Sphrantzes waits, rain dripping from his robes, urgency barely contained behind diplomatic courtesy.

GM: Dont make a good or bad development in Constantinople a part of a roll to evade a storm. The situation in Constantinople is unchanged. There may be a Greek here at port but we have specifically rolled for what the Sultan would do and that was not attacking the city. If I remember correctly.

10 dec 2025

Acknowledged narrative separation between weather rolls and geopolitical developments




You're absolutely right. I apologize for the overreach. The roll was about reaching Crete safely and encountering something useful—not about changing Constantinople's strategic situation, which has already been established through previous rolls.

Let me revise:

The Unexpected Encounter (Revised)

Within the hour, a Venetian harbor boat approaches the Santa Catalina despite the weather—oarsmen fighting the chop, a canopy barely protecting the passengers from the driving rain.

A official in Venetian colors climbs the rope ladder, sodden but dignified. Behind him comes a second figure—an older man in water-stained robes of Byzantine cut, his grey beard plastered to his chest.

The Venetian official bows formally.

"Your Majesty of Castile. I am Marco Contarini, deputy to the Governor of Candia. The Serenissima welcomes your fleet to shelter." His eyes flick to the Byzantine beside him. "And... fortune has provided an unusual coincidence. This gentleman arrived three days ago, bound eventually for Rome. When he heard a Castilian fleet had entered the harbor—a fleet flying crusader crosses—he begged to speak with you immediately."

The Byzantine steps forward. Despite his bedraggled appearance, he carries himself with the bearing of a man accustomed to courts.

"Your Majesty." His Castilian is accented but clear—learned, perhaps, from Spanish merchants in Constantinople. "I am Georgios Sphrantzes, protovestiarios to His Imperial Majesty John VIII Palaiologos."

He bows with formal precision.

"I carry letters for the Pope and the Christian kings, continuing our appeal for aid. But God has placed you in my path first—the king who completed the Reconquista, the king whose knights already stand on our walls." A note of genuine gratitude enters his voice. "Your three hundred men under Don Juan de Sotomayor have been a blessing, Your Majesty. The Emperor speaks of you often."

He glances at the Venetian official, then back to Juan.

"If Your Majesty permits, I could brief you on the current state of the city, the Ottoman dispositions, the political situation you will encounter. So that when you arrive, you arrive prepared."

Sphrantzes waits, offering intelligence and context—not crisis, but opportunity for preparation.

Welcome aboard. This is my wife Lucia and this is Catalina. Princess Catalina. 

Tell us what is going on.

10 dec 2025

Synthesized historical context and crafted diplomatic NPC response






Sphrantzes bows to Lucia with practiced courtly grace, and his stern face softens noticeably when he sees Catalina peering at him from behind her wooden horse.

"Your Highness. Your Majesty." He switches to decent Italian for Lucia's benefit. "You honor me."

The Venetian official, Contarini, clears his throat. "Perhaps we might continue this conversation out of the rain? The harbor master's quarters are at Your Majesty's disposal."

The Harbor Master's Quarters, Candia — Evening

The storm howls outside, but the stone building is warm and dry. Wine and food have been provided—Venetian hospitality for a king, even an unexpected one. Catalina has been taken to rest with Lucia and the ladies in an adjoining chamber.

Sphrantzes sits across from Juan, his Byzantine robes now dried, his composure restored. The Venetian official has withdrawn to give them privacy, though Juan suspects Venetian ears are not far away.

"The situation in Constantinople, Your Majesty." Sphrantzes folds his hands. "I will speak plainly, as one Christian to another."

He pauses, gathering his thoughts.

"The city endures. Your three hundred knights under Don Juan de Sotomayor patrol the walls and train our militia. Their presence has been... a balm to the people's spirits. For the first time in years, we see Western soldiers who have come to help, not to plunder."

His expression darkens.

"But the city itself is a shadow. Forty thousand souls, perhaps fewer, in walls built for half a million. Entire quarters stand empty. Farmers plant wheat inside the city walls because there are not enough people to fill the houses. The Theodosian Walls—" He shakes his head. "Your sixty thousand florins helped. But the walls stretch four miles, Your Majesty. Towers crumble. Gates rot. We patch what we can."

He takes a sip of wine.

"Sultan Murad is not currently at war with us. We pay him tribute—three hundred thousand silver coins each year—and he permits us to exist. His attention is elsewhere. The Karamanids in Anatolia. Troubles in the Balkans. He could take Constantinople if he wished, but..." Sphrantzes shrugs. "Why spend ten thousand lives storming walls when the fruit will fall into his hand eventually? He waits. We wither."

The Byzantine leans forward.

"This is what you sail into, Your Majesty. Not a siege. Not a battle. A slow death. The Emperor prays your arrival will change the calculation—show Murad that the West has not abandoned us, that attacking Constantinople means war with more than just our exhausted garrison."

He hesitates, as if weighing how much to say.

"There are also... internal matters. But perhaps Your Majesty has questions first?"

Sphrantzes waits, offering Juan the chance to direct the conversation.

how much is this tribute of 300.000 in florins?

10 dec 2025

Extrapolated medieval currency exchange rates and estimated tribute value










Sphrantzes's expression tightens at the question—the look of a man who has spent years watching his empire bleed gold.

"The tribute is paid in aspra—Byzantine silver." He calculates silently for a moment. "At current exchange rates, perhaps thirty thousand florins. Perhaps thirty-five. It fluctuates with the silver markets."

He sets down his wine cup.

"Thirty thousand florins, Your Majesty. Each year. Paid to a Sultan who could take the city whenever he wishes, simply for the privilege of continuing to exist." Bitterness creeps into his voice. "That sum would rebuild a section of the walls. It would hire a thousand mercenaries for a year. It would feed the city's poor for a decade. Instead, it fills Murad's treasury."

Sphrantzes spreads his hands.

"And yet we pay. Because the alternative is war, and we cannot survive a determined siege. Not as we are now. The tribute buys us time—time we spend praying that the West will remember Constantinople exists."

He looks at Juan directly.

"Your sixty thousand florins, Your Majesty—the aid you sent last year—that was nearly two years of tribute. The Emperor wept when he received it. Not from joy alone, but from shame. That a foreign king would give so freely what we beggar ourselves to pay our enemies."

Sphrantzes waits, watching Juan's reaction.

And now I sail to his city to see how we can help long-term. I am looking forward to it.

10 dec 2025

Orchestrated conversational response with gratitude and cautious optimism


Sphrantzes's formal composure cracks slightly. For a moment, the diplomat gives way to something more human—a man carrying the weight of his dying civilization, hearing words he had almost stopped believing he would ever hear.

"Your Majesty." His voice is rough. "I have traveled to Rome, to Venice, to Buda, to a dozen courts. I have begged and pleaded and debased myself before princes who nodded politely and gave nothing. Who spoke of 'the Turkish question' as though it were an abstract problem of philosophy rather than—"

He stops himself, takes a breath.

"Forgive me. I am... not accustomed to kings who say they will come and then actually come."

He straightens, recovering his diplomatic bearing.

"The Emperor will receive you with every honor Constantinople can still muster. It is not what it was—we cannot offer the pageantry of our grandfathers' time—but what we have, we will give." A ghost of pride enters his voice. "The city is poor, Your Majesty, but it has not forgotten how to welcome a true friend."

Sphrantzes hesitates, then adds:

"You mentioned long-term aid. The Emperor will wish to discuss this at length, of course. But if I may be so bold—there are three things Constantinople needs above all else."

He raises a finger. "Walls. Men. And a reason for Murad to fear the cost of attack."

He looks at Juan.

"Your presence alone may provide the third. The other two..."

He leaves the sentence unfinished, an invitation for Juan to respond.

I will have to see for myself what the situation is before I can develop a plan. 

I have offered Constantinople three choices. Leave and find refuge in my kingdom, stay on your own terms and probably perish with your pride and head held high. Or fight is we can actually win and fight with everything we have. Has the emperor considered these options? And how is the mood about these choices in the city?

10 dec 2025

Weighed diplomatic nuance against stark military choices presented









Sphrantzes is silent for a long moment. His fingers trace the rim of his wine cup, and Juan can see the diplomat calculating—what to reveal, what to conceal, how to frame truths that may be uncomfortable.

"Your Majesty's letter was... much discussed," he says carefully. "The Emperor read it aloud to his closest advisors. I was present."

He sets down the cup.

"The first option—refuge in Castile." Sphrantzes chooses his words with precision. "The Emperor is grateful for the offer. Profoundly grateful. But you must understand what you are asking. The Palaiologoi have held Constantinople for nearly two hundred years. Before them, other dynasties stretching back to Constantine himself. Eleven centuries, Your Majesty. To abandon the city..."

He shakes his head.

"It would be more than exile. It would be the death of an idea. The Emperor would become a pensioner in a foreign court, a curiosity, a relic. His children would grow up Castilian, not Roman. Within two generations, the name Palaiologos would mean nothing."

Sphrantzes meets Juan's eyes.

"Some in the city whisper that this would be wisdom. That survival matters more than pride. But they whisper it quietly, and never to the Emperor's face."

He pauses.

"The second option—to stay and perish with dignity. There are those who would choose this. The monks especially. They say it is better to die Roman and Orthodox than to live as slaves or beggars. The Emperor..." Another pause. "He has not ruled this out. If the end must come, he will die on the walls. This I know."

Sphrantzes leans forward slightly.

"But the third option, Your Majesty. To fight, truly fight, with a real chance of victory." Something flickers in his eyes—hope, carefully guarded. "This is what the Emperor prays for. This is why he sends men like me to grovel before Western princes. Not for charity. For alliance."

He spreads his hands.

"But what does 'fight with everything we have' mean? Constantinople alone cannot defeat the Ottomans. We know this. The question is whether the West will commit—truly commit—to a war that may last years, cost tens of thousands of lives, and offer no guarantee of success."

His voice drops.

"The mood in the city, Your Majesty? It is the mood of people who have been disappointed too many times to hope openly. They have heard promises before. They have seen Western knights arrive with grand speeches and leave with Byzantine gold. When your three hundred men came and stayed—when they patrolled the walls and trained beside our soldiers instead of demanding payments and privileges—it was like water in a desert."

He sits back.

"The people are watching, Your Majesty. Waiting to see if you are different. The Emperor is watching too."

Sphrantzes waits, having laid out the truth as carefully as a man can.

I think the third option will only be a possibility if Constantinople joins with Naples, Aragon, Castille and Portugal in one grand Empire or alliance. Anly then will we be able to turn back the turks. Otherwise Iberians will just be dying for someone else's glory. What this will look like, I am not sure about yet. And I will discuss this with the emperor at length. But something like this is the only way towards victory that is lasting.

Weighed diplomatic sensitivities surrounding Byzantine sovereignty and religious concerns







Sphrantzes goes very still.

The fire crackles. Rain lashes the windows. For a long moment, the Byzantine diplomat simply looks at Juan, his dark eyes unreadable.

"A grand alliance," he repeats slowly. "Or empire."

He rises from his chair, moving to the window where the storm rages beyond the glass. When he speaks, his voice is careful—the voice of a man navigating treacherous waters.

"Your Majesty speaks plainly. I will do the same."

He turns back to face Juan.

"What you propose is... not without precedent. Centuries ago, Crusader princes carved kingdoms from the East. They called themselves defenders of Christendom. Within a generation, they were warring with each other and treating with Muslims against fellow Christians. Within two centuries, they were gone."

Sphrantzes holds up a hand.

"I do not say this to offend. I say it because the Emperor will think it, even if he does not speak it. Byzantium has seen Western 'alliances' before. The Fourth Crusade came to save us from the infidel—and sacked Constantinople instead. Stole our relics. Burned our libraries. Put a Latin emperor on our throne for sixty years."

His voice carries no anger—only the weariness of old wounds.

"The people remember, Your Majesty. The priests remember. When they hear 'grand alliance with the West,' they think of 1204."

Sphrantzes returns to his seat, leaning forward.

"And yet."

He pauses.

"And yet we are dying. Slowly, certainly, but dying nonetheless. The Emperor knows this. He is not a fool, nor is he ruled by pride alone. If there is a path to genuine survival—not charity, not temporary rescue, but lasting security..."

He spreads his hands.

"He will listen. But Your Majesty must understand what you are asking. You speak of Constantinople joining an Iberian alliance. To Byzantine ears, this sounds like... submission. Like becoming a province of a Western empire rather than the heart of our own."

His eyes meet Juan's.

"What would this union look like? Would the Emperor bend the knee to Castile? Would Constantinople become a vassal? Would the Orthodox Church submit to Rome?"

He shakes his head slowly.

"These questions will be asked, Your Majesty. By the Emperor, by his court, by the Patriarch, by the people in the streets. If you wish to propose such an alliance, you must have answers."

Sphrantzes waits—not hostile, not dismissive, but probing. Testing whether Juan has thought beyond the grand vision to the difficult details.

I understand. I will speak them with the emperor. And hear what he has to say. And he will listen to what I have to say. Then we will see what they choose. 

Was there anything else you wanted to speak to me about?

10 dec 2025

Excavated Byzantine political tensions and crafted contextual response options





Sphrantzes nods slowly, accepting that some conversations must wait for Constantinople.

"Two matters, Your Majesty. One practical, one... delicate."

He steeples his fingers.

"The practical matter first. When you arrive, there will be ceremony. The Emperor will insist upon it—not from vanity, but because Constantinople must show the world it still commands respect. Your entrance will be watched. How the Emperor receives you, where you are housed, what honors are offered—all of this sends messages. To our people. To the Ottoman spies who infest the city. To Venice and Genoa and everyone else with interests in the East."

He pauses.

"I tell you this so you are not surprised. The pageantry may seem excessive for a city so diminished. But it is... necessary. It is how we remind ourselves, and others, that we are still Rome."

Sphrantzes shifts in his seat, and his expression grows more guarded.

"The delicate matter. The Church."

He lets the word hang for a moment.

"Your Majesty comes bearing papal favor. You have reformed the Western Church, allied with Eugenius, earned the Pope's blessing. This is known. And it creates... complications."

He chooses his next words with care.

"The Emperor seeks union with Rome. He believes it is the only way to secure Western aid on the scale we need. But the Patriarch, the monks, many of the clergy and common people—they would rather die Orthodox than submit to the Pope. The wound of 1204 runs deep, but the wound of theology runs deeper."

Sphrantzes meets Juan's eyes.

"If you arrive as a champion of Rome demanding religious submission as the price of alliance, you will find doors closing before you. But if you arrive as a Christian king seeking to defend a Christian city—leaving the question of Church union to churchmen—you may find more friends than you expect."

He spreads his hands.

"I offer this only as counsel, Your Majesty. The Emperor will make his own choices. But the religious question has destroyed better alliances than ours."

Sphrantzes waits to see if Juan has further questions, or if the audience is concluded.

The church is reforming even as we speak. You have heard of the hussites and how even they have found their place in the structure of the church. The matter of the filiosque does not need to be resolved, the church is large and even within it's ranks there is space for somewhat different interpretations. In fact; what are we even talking about? We are all christians are we not? Would the Greeks consider coming back to the church with their dogma intact?

10 dec 2025

Weighed theological compromise against historical skepticism and political realities







Sphrantzes's eyebrows rise. For a moment, the careful diplomat is replaced by something more genuine—surprise, and behind it, a flicker of cautious hope.

"Your Majesty is... better informed on theology than most Western kings I have met."

He leans back, studying Juan with new interest.

"The Filioque. Yes. That is the word that has divided Christendom for four hundred years. Such a small thing—and the Son—three words in a creed. And yet men have died over it. Churches have split. Empires have turned their backs on each other while the infidel advances."

He is quiet for a moment, thinking.

"You ask if the Greeks would return to communion with Rome with their dogma intact. This is..." He searches for the right word. "This is the question, Your Majesty. The only question that matters."

Sphrantzes rises again, pacing slowly.

"The Emperor would accept it in a heartbeat. He cares about survival, not theology. He would kiss the Pope's ring tomorrow if it brought fifty thousand soldiers to Constantinople's defense."

He holds up a finger.

"But the Emperor is not the Church. The Patriarch—the monks of Mount Athos—the parish priests—the babushkas who light candles in every church in the city—" He shakes his head. "They remember what their grandfathers taught them. That Rome demands submission. That the Latins want to change us, not embrace us. That union means becoming something we are not."

He turns to face Juan.

"The Hussites, you say, have found their place. I confess I do not know the details of this arrangement. But I know what the Orthodox would need to hear."

Sphrantzes counts on his fingers.

"First—that the Filioque is not imposed. That we may continue to recite the Creed as we always have. Second—that our rites are respected. Our liturgy, our calendar, our traditions of married clergy, our way of making the sign of the cross. Third—that the Patriarch of Constantinople is not made subordinate to Rome, but recognized as equal in honor, if not in primacy."

He pauses.

"Fourth—and this is the hardest—that Rome admits the Fourth Crusade was a crime. That the sack of Constantinople was sin. That the Latin Empire was illegitimate."

Sphrantzes spreads his hands.

"Can Rome offer this? Would the Pope accept Greeks as brothers rather than wayward children returning to obedience? Would the cardinals permit an Eastern church that does not conform to Western practice?"

His eyes search Juan's face.

"If so, Your Majesty—if you could deliver such terms—you would accomplish what councils and emperors have failed to achieve for centuries. The Church would reunite. East and West would stand together against the Turk."

A pause.

"But I have been a diplomat for thirty years. I have learned that what kings promise and what popes deliver are not always the same thing."

Sphrantzes waits, genuinely curious now—is Juan speaking of dreams, or does he have reason to believe such an accommodation is possible?

Too bad. If these would be the terms of the Greeks, then I dont see any possibility of the church joining. The Vatican rules supreme and the Greeks will have to ecknowledge that they are part of a greater church where they are a minority. Their number warrant a cardinal in Rome, but not one of equal station. Surely they understand this no? And if they don't I will respect their choice.

10 dec 2025

Calibrated diplomatic response balancing firmness with pragmatic negotiation





Sphrantzes is silent for a long moment. The storm continues to rage outside, filling the silence with its fury.

When he speaks, his voice is quiet. Not angry. Not offended. Simply... honest.

"Your Majesty speaks more plainly than any Western prince I have ever met."

He sits down slowly, as if suddenly feeling the weight of his years.

"You are correct, of course. The Greeks are few. Rome is vast. The mathematics of the matter are what they are." He rubs his eyes. "And yet mathematics have never moved the hearts of men who believe their souls are at stake."

He looks up at Juan.

"I will tell you something I would not tell most Western kings. The Emperor agrees with you. He knows we cannot negotiate as equals—we have nothing to bargain with but our history and our pride. He would accept papal supremacy tomorrow if it meant survival. He has said as much to me in private."

Sphrantzes's voice drops.

"But the Emperor is not a tyrant. He cannot force the Church to submit. If the Patriarch refuses—if the monks refuse—if the people refuse—then union becomes a document signed by emperors and ignored by everyone else. And the resentment it breeds may be worse than no union at all."

He spreads his hands.

"This is the trap we are in, Your Majesty. The Emperor wants to live. The Church wants to die Orthodox. And I..."

A tired smile crosses his face.

"I am simply a messenger, carrying impossible choices between men who cannot agree."

He straightens, recovering some of his diplomatic composure.

"I will convey your words to the Emperor faithfully. He will appreciate your honesty, even if the terms are... difficult. Better to know where a man stands than to chase shadows."

Sphrantzes pauses.

"May I ask one thing, Your Majesty? If the Church cannot unite—if the Orthodox cannot bring themselves to submit to Rome—does that end the possibility of alliance? Or is there a path to cooperation that does not require the Greeks to renounce what they believe?"

He watches Juan carefully, seeking to understand the limits of what Castile might offer.

Better to let me speak with the emperor directly. I am on my way there now. 

I will lay out the choices before him and let him choose. Mending the scism would have been a nice bonus, but not a requirement for an alliance no.

10 dec 2025

Orchestrated diplomatic closure and pivoted toward imperial audience



Sphrantzes exhales slowly. Something in his shoulders loosens—tension he has carried for so long he probably no longer noticed it.

"Not a requirement," he repeats softly. "Your Majesty, you have no idea how rare those words are."

He rises and bows—a deep bow, more genuine than the formal courtesies he offered earlier.

"I have taken enough of your time, and you have a family to attend to in this storm. But I thank you for this conversation. It has been..." He searches for the word. "Clarifying."

He moves toward the door, then pauses.

"The storm should blow itself out by tomorrow evening, perhaps the morning after. If Your Majesty permits, I will abandon my journey to Rome and sail with your fleet to Constantinople. The Emperor will want to know what manner of man approaches his city, and I would rather he hear it from me than from rumors and speculation."

A slight smile crosses his weathered face.

"Besides, I find I am curious to see what happens when you and His Imperial Majesty sit down together. It may be the most honest conversation Constantinople has had with the West in centuries."

Sphrantzes waits for Juan's permission to join the fleet, and for any final words before withdrawing.

Of course, join us!

We sail at best speed to Constantinople.

Architected maritime encounter table considering route hazards and player agency



CHAOS ROLL: Crete to Constantinople

Distance: ~400-500 nautical miles Expected journey: 5-7 days depending on conditions Route: Candia → Aegean Sea → Dardanelles → Sea of Marmara → Constantinople Season: Early April 1434 (post-storm, spring weather)

Factors in Play:

Ten ships, 581 knights, royal family aboard
Crews well-drilled and confident after Naples exercises
Sphrantzes aboard—knows these waters, knows the politics
The Dardanelles are Ottoman-controlled on both shores
Sultan Murad not actively at war with Constantinople, but his patrols watch all traffic
Venetian and Genoese merchant traffic common in these waters
Don Juan de Sotomayor's 300 knights already in Constantinople—word of Castilian presence has spread
Roll	Encounter
1-10	Ottoman war galleys at the Dardanelles. A substantial Turkish squadron blocks or challenges passage. Tense confrontation. Juan must decide how to proceed.
11-20	Ottoman patrol intercept. Smaller Turkish force (3-5 galleys) moves to investigate the Christian fleet. Demands, threats, or inspection possible.
21-30	Genoese interference. Genoese vessels in the Aegean or at the straits—Loss of shadowing, questioning, or outright hostility given Genoa's opposition to Castile in Naples.
31-40	Difficult passage. Contrary winds or currents at the Dardanelles. Days of delay, frustration, possible need to negotiate with Ottoman shore authorities for anchorage.
41-55	Tense but uneventful. Ottoman sails visible, watching. The passage is nerve-wracking but no confrontation occurs. Fleet arrives intact.
56-70	Smooth sailing. Favorable winds, no incidents. The Dardanelles passage goes easier than expected. Fleet arrives in good order.
71-80	Advantageous timing. Ottoman patrols elsewhere, or friendly merchant provides intelligence. Fleet passes through with unexpected ease.
81-90	Venetian assistance. A Venetian convoy or diplomatic vessel provides escort, information, or smooth passage through contested waters.
91-95	Impressive arrival. Word of the fleet precedes it. Constantinople prepares a reception. The entrance becomes a statement of Western commitment.
96-100	Remarkable fortune. Something extraordinary—perhaps an encounter that reshapes diplomatic possibilities, or a sign that captures imagination.
Ready to roll when you give the word.

Calculated voyage timeline accounting for storm delays and favorable winds



Smooth Sailing: Crete to Constantinople

The storm blows itself out by the evening of April 6th. The fleet departs Candia on the morning of April 7th, sails filled with clean post-storm winds.

The Aegean is kind to them. Island after island slides past—Karpathos, Rhodes glimpsed in the distance, the scattered Cyclades. Sphrantzes proves invaluable, pointing out landmarks, explaining which islands are Venetian, which Genoese, which Ottoman, which belong to the Knights Hospitaller.

The Dardanelles approach on April 11th. The crews grow tense—Ottoman fortresses visible on both shores, smoke rising from watchfires. Turkish galleys are spotted, distant shapes observing from the Asian side.

But they do not approach.

"They see crusader crosses," Sphrantzes murmurs, standing beside Juan at the rail. "They see ten ships, not two or three. They will report to their commanders, but they will not risk a battle without orders. Murad does not want war with the West. Not yet."

The passage takes most of a day, the fleet moving in tight formation, cannons ready but not run out. By evening, they emerge into the Sea of Marmara.

April 14, 1434 — Constantinople

The city appears at dawn.

Even diminished, even crumbling, Constantinople takes the breath away. The massive Theodosian Walls stretch across the horizon, tower after tower after tower. The dome of the Hagia Sophia rises above the urban sprawl, catching the morning light. The Golden Horn glitters beyond.

Catalina is on deck, held in Juan's arms, pointing excitedly at everything.

"Ciudad grande, Papá!"

"Yes, little one," Juan murmurs. "The greatest city in the world. Once."

Sphrantzes stands nearby, his face unreadable as he gazes at his home.

"She is still beautiful," he says quietly. "Even now. Even dying."

The fleet approaches the harbor. How does Juan wish to proceed with the arrival?

Devised arrival complications table and prepared Constantinople reception scene









ARRIVAL AT CONSTANTINOPLE — Complication

The fleet approaches the Golden Horn, signal flags raised in the universal patterns of peaceful approach. The harbor should be opening before them—Byzantine pilots coming out to guide them to anchorage, officials preparing to receive a Christian king.

Instead, the harbor chain remains raised.

The great iron chain that has protected Constantinople's harbor for centuries stretches across the mouth of the Golden Horn, barring entry. On the sea walls, soldiers watch. No boats come out to greet them.

"This is... unexpected," Sphrantzes says, his voice tight. He moves to the rail, squinting at the walls. "The Emperor knew I was traveling west. He would have received word of your fleet. This should not—"

A small boat finally emerges from behind the chain. A single vessel, flying Byzantine colors, rowing hard toward the Santa Catalina.

Minutes pass. The boat draws alongside. A haggard-looking official climbs the rope ladder, his robes disheveled, his face pale with evident anxiety.

He sees Sphrantzes and nearly collapses with relief.

"Protovestiarios! Thank God. Thank God you've returned." His Greek is rapid, panicked. Sphrantzes responds sharply, and the two exchange urgent words.

Sphrantzes turns to Juan, his face grave.

"Your Majesty. There has been... an incident. Three days ago. A Genoese merchant was murdered in the city—stabbed in the Venetian quarter. The Genoese colony claims it was a Venetian plot. The Venetians claim it was Genoese provocation. Both communities have armed their men. There has been fighting in the streets."

He gestures toward the chain.

"The Emperor has closed the harbor to prevent either side from bringing in reinforcements. He fears open warfare between the Italian quarters. And now a fleet flying crusader crosses arrives—and no one knows whose side you are on."

The harbor chain remains raised. The city watches. What does Juan do?

Dear harbour master, I am king Juan of Castille. Hopefully, you know that I have not taken sides in the Genoese - Venetian conflict. I am merely sailing here as promised to deliver on my promise to the Byzantine people. I have come to help. 

The Protovestiarios can corroborate my story.

Analyzed NPC motivations and crafted favorable reaction outcomes









NPC ANALYSIS: Byzantine Harbor Official

What does this NPC want?

To not make a catastrophic mistake that ends his career (or his life)
To follow his orders from the Emperor (keep harbor closed)
To pass responsibility to someone with higher authority
For this impossible situation to become someone else's problem
What won't he say?

That he has no authority to open the chain on his own
That he's terrified of making the wrong choice
That he doesn't fully trust Sphrantzes's judgment after weeks away from the city
That he suspects everyone of ulterior motives right now
Factors Favoring Juan:

Sphrantzes is protovestiarios—one of the highest officials in the Empire
Castile has no stake in Venetian-Genoese rivalry
300 Castilian knights already serve on Constantinople's walls
The Emperor has been expecting Western aid
Juan's fleet flies crusader crosses, not Italian colors
Factors Against:

The official has explicit orders to keep the harbor closed
The city is on edge—any mistake could ignite wider violence
Byzantine bureaucracy is cautious by nature and training
Sphrantzes has been away—the official may not know if circumstances have changed
Roll	Reaction
1-10	Rigid refusal. The official will not deviate from his orders for anyone. The chain stays up. Juan must wait outside the harbor while word is sent to the Emperor—possibly overnight or longer. Humiliating delay.
11-25	Fearful paralysis. The official believes Juan but cannot bring himself to act. He insists on sending for a superior—hours of waiting in the harbor mouth while the city watches and rumors spread.
26-40	Cautious procedure. The official accepts Sphrantzes's authority but insists on inspection of the fleet first. Boats sent to examine each ship for Venetian or Genoese fighters. Slow, bureaucratic, but eventually permitted entry.
41-55	Grudging acceptance. Sphrantzes's rank and Juan's explanation are sufficient. The official agrees to open the chain but insists on a limited anchorage away from both Italian quarters. Conditional welcome.
56-70	Professional cooperation. The official recognizes the situation and defers to Sphrantzes's judgment. The chain is lowered. The fleet is guided to appropriate anchorage. A message is sent ahead to the Emperor.
71-85	Relieved welcome. The official sees the Castilian fleet as potential solution, not problem. Chain lowered promptly. Word sent to the Emperor that King Juan has arrived. Proper reception begins to organize.
86-95	Eager assistance. The official practically begs Juan to help restore order. Chain lowered immediately. Imperial officials summoned. The arrival becomes an opportunity to calm the city.
96-100	The Emperor himself. Word has already reached the palace. Before the official can decide, imperial boats appear—the Emperor has sent his own representatives to welcome Juan personally, bypassing all bureaucratic delay.
Ready to roll when you give the word.

Orchestrated positive narrative outcome from favorable roll result


Eager Assistance

The harbor official stares at Juan, then at Sphrantzes, then back at Juan. Something shifts in his face—the rigid mask of bureaucratic caution cracking, replaced by something more desperate. More human.

"King Juan of Castile," he repeats. "The king whose knights stand on our walls. The king who sent sixty thousand florins when no one else would send a copper."

He turns to Sphrantzes and speaks rapidly in Greek. Sphrantzes responds, his tone sharp, commanding. The official nods repeatedly, almost frantically.

Sphrantzes translates: "He says the city has been holding its breath for three days. The Emperor has confined himself to the palace, trying to mediate between the Venetians and Genoese. Both sides have barricaded their quarters. There have been killings—four dead, perhaps more. The city guard is stretched thin. Our own garrison does not dare intervene for fear of being seen as taking sides."

The official speaks again, gesturing toward Juan's fleet with something like pleading in his eyes.

"He says..." Sphrantzes pauses, a faint smile crossing his weary face. "He says that perhaps God has sent you at exactly the right moment. A Christian king with no loyalty to Venice or Genoa. Knights who answer to neither Italian power. Someone who can stand between them without being accused of partisanship."

The official barks orders to his oarsmen. The small boat pushes off, racing back toward the chain.

Within minutes, the great iron links begin to descend into the water with a groaning rattle that echoes across the harbor. Signal fires light on the walls—not warnings, but announcements.

Sphrantzes watches the chain lower, then turns to Juan.

"Word will reach the palace before we dock. The Emperor will know you have arrived—and he will know why the harbor opened for you when it opened for no one else." He pauses. "This is either a gift or a burden, Your Majesty. The city will look to you to help solve a problem that is not yours."

The fleet begins to move forward into the Golden Horn. On the docks ahead, people are gathering—soldiers, merchants, common folk emerging from their homes to see the ships flying crusader crosses.

And beyond the docks, visible above the rooftops, the dome of the Hagia Sophia gleams in the morning light.

The fleet enters the harbor. How does Juan wish to proceed?

I go and get Lucia and Catalina. 

Lucia, we are about to meet the last Roman Emperor. Wear your finest and keep Catalina company

I kneel down before Catalina. 

Catalina, we are about to meet some important and serious people. Catalina must be brave and quiet and stay with mama ok? Can you do that?

Orchestrated family preparations for Constantinople's diplomatic arrival


Aboard the Santa Catalina — The Great Cabin

Lucia looks up from the small traveling mirror where she has been attempting to restore some order to her hair after two weeks at sea. Her eyes meet Juan's, and she reads the gravity in his expression.

"The last Roman Emperor," she repeats softly. She sets down the mirror and rises, moving to the chest where her finest gown has been carefully packed. "I had hoped for a bath first, but I suppose history does not wait for such things."

There is no complaint in her voice—only the dry wit Juan has come to know. She begins to dress, her ladies-in-waiting hurrying to assist.

Catalina looks up at her father with wide, serious eyes. At two years old, she does not understand emperors or diplomacy, but she understands tone. She understands that Papá is speaking to her like she is important.

"Importante," she repeats solemnly, clutching her wooden horse. "Seria."

She nods with exaggerated gravity, her dark curls bouncing.

"Catalina brave," she announces. Then, after a moment's thought: "Y quiet."

She puts a finger to her lips to demonstrate, then looks up at Juan for approval.

Lucia, halfway into her gown, catches the exchange and smiles despite herself.

"She will be good for perhaps ten minutes, my love. After that, God alone knows what she will do."

The fleet is approaching the docks. The crowds are growing. Somewhere in the city, word is racing toward the palace. How does Juan wish to make his entrance?

I get ready to disembark with Lucia and Catalina. I make sure we are the first official travellers to step on shore. Ready to meet whatever awaits us.

11 dec 2025

Orchestrated formal Constantinople arrival with welcoming reception amid city tensions




The Docks of Constantinople — April 14, 1434

The Santa Catalina glides toward the ancient stone quay, her crew working in disciplined silence. The other nine ships follow in formation, their crusader crosses bright against the morning sky.

Juan stands at the rail in his finest—not armor, but the rich garments of a Christian king: deep Castilian crimson, the golden castle-and-lion of his arms embroidered on his chest, his father's sword at his hip. Lucia is beside him in emerald silk, her dark hair bound up in the Italian fashion, composed and regal despite the chaos they are sailing into. Catalina rests on her mother's hip, wooden horse clutched tight, her small face a mask of determined seriousness.

Behind them, the knights have assembled on deck in ranks—not armed for battle, but in clean surcoats, polished mail visible beneath. A statement: we come in peace, but we are not weak.

The gangplank is lowered.

The docks are crowded, but the crowd is strange—clusters of people who do not mix. Byzantine soldiers in worn uniforms form a loose cordon. Behind them, civilians watch: Greeks in threadbare robes, a knot of merchants who might be Venetian from their dress, another group standing pointedly apart who are likely Genoese. The tension is palpable—a city holding its breath.

And there, pushing through the crowd with a small escort of palace guards, comes a figure in imperial purple.

He is not what Juan expected.

Emperor John VIII Palaiologos is perhaps forty years old, thin and careworn, with a closely-trimmed beard going grey at the edges. His robes are magnificent—the ancient purple of Rome—but they hang on him like garments made for a larger man. His crown is gold, set with pearls and rubies, but it seems to weigh heavily on his brow.

His eyes, though. His eyes are sharp, alive, desperate.

He stops at the foot of the gangplank as Juan descends with his family. For a moment, the two men simply look at each other—the king who conquered Granada, the emperor who is losing Constantinople.

Then John VIII speaks, his voice carrying across the silent docks. His Greek is formal, ancient, but Sphrantzes translates immediately from behind Juan:

"King Juan of Castile. You promised aid, and you have come. You sent gold when others sent words. You sent knights when others sent prayers."

The Emperor steps forward and does something that sends a murmur through the crowd.

He extends his hands—not to receive homage, but to clasp Juan's own. Equal to equal.

"Welcome to Constantinople, brother king. We have much to discuss."

His eyes flick briefly to the armed clusters of Italians watching from the crowd, then back to Juan.

"Much to discuss indeed."

The Emperor waits, his hands still clasping Juan's, the city watching.

Strategized Emperor's guarded resistance and immediate agenda






NPC Analysis: Emperor John VIII Palaiologos

What does the Emperor want?

To test whether Juan is different from every other Western prince who promised aid and delivered nothing
To solve the immediate Venetian-Genoese crisis—which is a convenient test of Juan's usefulness
To extract maximum military commitment while surrendering minimum sovereignty
To maintain imperial dignity even while his empire crumbles around him
What won't he say?

How close he is to accepting any terms for genuine aid
That he is using the Italian crisis as a test of Juan's character and capability
That he has already weighed Juan's three options and knows which he prefers
That he trusts no Western promises until they are proven in action
The Emperor releases Juan's hands, his expression unreadable. The warmth of the greeting remains, but something more formal settles over him—the mask of a man who has survived two decades of impossible politics.

"Of course. You must rest. Your wife and daughter must be weary."

He gestures, and servants appear—threadbare livery, but dignified bearing. The ancient machinery of Byzantine hospitality creaking into motion.

"The Palace of Blachernae will receive you. It is... not what it was in my grandfather's day, but it remains suitable for a king."

The Emperor turns to walk beside Juan as the procession begins to form, his voice dropping so that only Juan and Sphrantzes can hear.

"Crowns and empires. Yes. We will speak of such things."

A pause. His eyes drift toward the clusters of Venetians and Genoese, still watching from their separate positions on the dock.

"But perhaps first, you might advise me on a more immediate matter. A murdered merchant. Two Italian quarters armed for war in my city. And an Emperor who cannot be seen to favor either side without losing the trade that keeps his people fed."

He glances at Juan sidelong.

"You are, I am told, a king who solves problems. Here is one. What would you do?"

The Emperor walks beside Juan, waiting. It is not quite a test—but it is not quite not a test either.

Have you summoned both sides to you for an audience?

11 dec 2025

Weighed imperial pride against admission of diplomatic failure




The Emperor's jaw tightens almost imperceptibly.

"Summoned. Yes."

He continues walking, his gaze fixed ahead on the path toward the palace. The silence stretches for a few paces.

"The Venetian bailo sent his regrets. Urgent matters of commerce requiring his attention. The Genoese podestà was more direct—he does not negotiate while Venetian assassins walk free."

Another pause.

"I could compel them, of course. I am Emperor. I could send my guard to drag them before me in chains."

His tone makes clear how empty that threat is. The imperial guard struggling to keep order, the trade that keeps Constantinople alive flowing through Italian hands, the delicate balance that could shatter at a wrong move.

"But an Emperor who must drag merchants to audience has already lost the audience."

He glances at Juan.

"You have dealt with proud men who believe themselves beyond summoning, I think. Granada did not fall to a king who waited for his enemies to come to him."

The Emperor walks on, leaving the implicit question hanging: what would Juan do differently?

I know what I would do if I were in your shoes. But it would be wrong of me to solve this problem on my own. It is a matter of authority and if I would use mine, it would reduce yours. 

How is your legal system. Is it as free of corruption as could reasonably be expected? Would this ideally be resolved in such a court?

11 dec 2025

Analyzed diplomatic dynamics and crafted evasive imperial response






The Emperor's pace slows slightly. He looks at Juan with something new in his expression—a flicker of reassessment.

"You understand authority," he says quietly. "Good. That is... not always the case with Western kings."

They walk a few more paces. The palace of Blachernae is visible now, rising above the city's rooftops—ancient, crumbling in places, but still magnificent.

"Our courts." The Emperor's voice is careful. "The law of Rome has endured for a thousand years. Our judges are learned. Our procedures are ancient and thorough."

He pauses.

"But the Italian quarters do not answer to Roman law. They have their own courts, their own judges, their own rights—granted by my predecessors in exchange for trade and coin. A Venetian murders a Genoese, or a Genoese murders a Venetian, and each side claims jurisdiction. Each side claims the other's court is corrupt, biased, illegitimate."

The Emperor's lips thin.

"If I intervene and declare one court competent, I have taken a side. If I establish an imperial tribunal, both will refuse to recognize it. If I do nothing..."

He gestures vaguely toward the city behind them, where armed men watch each other across barricaded streets.

"You see the result."

He looks at Juan directly.

"You speak of reducing my authority. It is a kind thought. But what authority remains to reduce when merchants ignore imperial summons and arm their quarters like petty lords?"

The Emperor waits, watching Juan's face.

So the traders both hold sovereign authority. Venetians and Genoese are at each other's throats. What else is new? How is this your problem then?

11 dec 2025

Strategized evasive response while concealing underlying desperation and vulnerability




The Emperor stops walking.

For a moment, his mask slips—and beneath it is not anger, but exhaustion. The bone-deep weariness of a man holding together an empire with his fingernails.

"My problem."

He turns to face Juan fully. Behind them, the procession halts—servants, guards, Sphrantzes, all waiting at a respectful distance.

"It is my problem, King Juan, because when Venetians and Genoese kill each other in the streets, it is Byzantine blood that spills between them. My subjects. Caught in crossfire. Beaten for being in the wrong quarter at the wrong hour."

His voice remains level, but there is ice beneath it.

"It is my problem because if the fighting spreads—if one side burns the other's warehouses—the grain ships stop coming. And then my people starve. Not Venetians. Not Genoese. My people."

He gestures toward the city.

"It is my problem because every day this continues, every day the Emperor of Rome cannot keep order in his own capital, the Sultan's spies write reports. And Murad learns that Constantinople is weaker than he thought. That perhaps the tribute he collects is less than he could take by force."

The Emperor's eyes are hard now.

"You ask what else is new. Nothing. This is old. This is what my empire has become—a carcass that dogs fight over while the wolf watches from the hills."

He pauses.

"So. Is it still not your problem either?"

The Emperor waits, something unspoken in his gaze.

And has this happened yet? Have your people been caught in the crossfire? Or will this inevitably happen if the situation continues? Are you and your people affected by this conflict already?

11 dec 2025

Weighed Emperor's credibility against Juan's probing questions strategically







The Emperor is silent for a moment. His eyes narrow slightly—not in anger, but in recognition. He is being tested in return.

"Four dead," he says flatly. "That we know of. Over three days."

He holds up fingers as he counts.

"Two Genoese. One Venetian. And one—" He pauses. "One was a Greek boy. Fifteen years old. A baker's apprentice. He was carrying bread through the Genoese quarter when the fighting started. Wrong place. Wrong hour."

The Emperor lowers his hand.

"His father came to the palace. Knelt before me. Asked for justice." A muscle twitches in his jaw. "I had none to give him. The Genoese say it was an accident. The Venetians say it proves Genoese brutality. And the boy is still dead."

He resumes walking, slower now.

"So yes. It has happened. Not a massacre. Not yet. But the quarters are barricaded. My people who live near the boundaries have fled to churches, to relatives, to anywhere they think is safe. Trade has stopped. The markets are half-empty."

He glances at Juan.

"You ask if this will inevitably continue. I do not know. Perhaps they will tire of watching each other across barricades. Perhaps a spark will set the whole city burning. I have seen both happen in my lifetime."

The Emperor walks on toward the palace, leaving space for Juan to respond.

We could do this. 

We demand to speak with the highest authorities of both traders. They are summoned to your palace where you will demand relations to return to normal relations between Genoa and Venice. They can live within your walls if they can keep the peace, if they can't then they will be thrown out. We give them a week or so to let them settle accounts between them. Let them come to an understanding on their own that settles the matter. After that, the barricades come down, the swords are put away and my men can provide security in the beginning. If the peace is violated by any individual, you throw them out of the city. They can set up their own town outside where they can murder each other if they want. 

What do you think?

11 dec 2025

Weighed plan's merits against Emperor's political vulnerabilities and enforcement concerns






The Emperor listens without interrupting. When Juan finishes, he continues walking in silence for several paces, his face betraying nothing.

Then, quietly:

"They have already refused my summons."

He lets that sit for a moment.

"What changes when I summon them again? They will send the same regrets. The same excuses. And the Emperor will have been ignored twice instead of once."

He stops at a crumbling fountain in a small courtyard. The water still flows—barely—a thin trickle into a basin green with age. He stares at it as he speaks.

"You say your men can provide security. Castilian knights patrolling Byzantine streets, keeping Italian merchants in line." He glances at Juan. "And when the Venetian bailo writes to the Doge that the Emperor of Rome cannot keep order without Spanish soldiers? When the Genoese podestà tells his masters that Constantinople is now a Castilian protectorate?"

His voice is not accusatory. Merely... probing.

"You spoke earlier of not reducing my authority. This plan—" He pauses. "It may solve the problem. But what does it cost me?"

He turns to face Juan fully.

"And what happens when they refuse to come? What is the teeth behind the summons?"

The Emperor waits, watching Juan with the eyes of a man who has learned to count costs carefully.

You have already graciously asked for them to come. Now you demand they come. As long as they understand that this is not a request and that you will drag them out with force if needed, they will come. 

in regards to my knights providing security, I can offer it to them directly. If they both feel comfortable with me providing security, then it is not you who is imposing my knights on them. 

And what does it cost you? This situation has already cost you. And doing nothing will continue to cost you. You are simply afraid. Just do what needs to be done and step over the fear. Christians have many, many references to situations like this. When we stand before God, should we not have protected the baker boy? 

Again, I cannot act in your stead. I can only offer you my aid should you choose to accept it and my council.

Weighed bold directness against imperial pride, calibrated response stakes








NPC Analysis: Emperor John VIII — Reaction to Being Called Afraid

What does the Emperor want right now?

To not feel humiliated by a younger king
To find a way forward that preserves his dignity
To determine if Juan's bluntness is disrespect or genuine counsel
To not appear weak before his own servants and guards watching from a distance
What won't he say?

That Juan is right—he has been paralyzed by fear
That no one has spoken to him this directly in years
That part of him is relieved someone finally said it
How desperate he truly is
Factors in this approach:

Juan offered practical solutions (+)
Juan preserved imperial face by offering knights through Italian consent (+)
Juan invoked Christian duty and the dead boy (emotionally resonant) (+)
Juan called the Emperor afraid to his face (risky—insight or insult?)
Juan emphasized he cannot act in the Emperor's stead, respecting sovereignty (+)
Roll	Reaction
1-10	Cold fury. The Emperor's pride cannot absorb being called a coward. He withdraws behind imperial formality. The audience effectively ends. Damage to the relationship that will take time to repair.
11-20	Wounded dignity. The Emperor does not explode, but he grows distant. He thanks Juan for his counsel and changes the subject. The matter is not resolved. Trust has been lost.
21-35	Defensive deflection. The Emperor argues back—he is not afraid, merely prudent. The conversation becomes a debate about caution versus action. No resolution, but no permanent damage.
36-50	Grudging acknowledgment. The Emperor does not admit fear, but he stops arguing. He says he will "consider" Juan's proposal. The door remains open, but he needs time to swallow his pride.
51-65	Quiet acceptance. The Emperor is silent for a long moment, then nods slowly. He does not admit Juan is right, but he begins discussing practicalities—how the summons would work, what threats would be credible. Progress.
66-80	Respect for honesty. The Emperor recognizes that Juan spoke truth others would not dare speak. He admits—obliquely—that he has been hesitating. He agrees to act, and asks for Juan's help in planning the summons.
81-90	Relief. Something breaks in the Emperor. Not his dignity, but his isolation. He admits he has been afraid—not in those words, but close enough. He accepts Juan's offer fully and asks him to stand beside him when the Italians are summoned.
91-95	Transformation. Juan's words strike deep. The Emperor sees himself clearly—perhaps for the first time in years. He thanks Juan not with words but with action: immediate orders to summon the Italians, a request for Juan's knights, and a promise to protect his people.
96-100	Brotherhood. The Emperor clasps Juan's arm and speaks from the heart. "No one has spoken to me thus since my father died." A bond forms—not political alliance, but genuine trust between two men carrying impossible burdens.
Ready to roll when you give the word.

Orchestrated proud character's grudging retreat and emotional processing



Grudging Acknowledgment

The Emperor's face goes very still.

For a long moment, he simply looks at Juan. The fountain trickles beside them. Somewhere in the distance, a dog barks. The servants and guards wait at the edge of the courtyard, too far to hear but close enough to watch.

When John VIII speaks, his voice is carefully controlled.

"You are bold, King of Castile."

He turns away, looking at the thin stream of water falling into the basin. His jaw works slightly, as if chewing on words he will not say.

"I have ruled this empire for nine years. Before that, I was regent for my father. I have negotiated with sultans. I have begged Western princes for aid. I have watched my brothers plot against me and my treasury drain to nothing."

He pauses.

"And now a young king—victorious, wealthy, secure on his throne—tells me I am simply afraid."

The silence stretches.

"Perhaps you are right."

The words are barely audible. He does not look at Juan.

"Perhaps I have grown too cautious. Too accustomed to managing decline instead of fighting it."

He straightens, and when he turns back, the imperial mask is in place again—but something has shifted beneath it.

"I will consider your proposal. The summons. The ultimatum. Your knights." His tone is formal now, distant. "We will speak more after you have rested. You and your family will be shown to your quarters."

He gestures, and servants hurry forward.

"Tonight there will be a dinner. Small. Private. We can continue this discussion then."

The Emperor inclines his head—not quite a bow, but an acknowledgment—and turns to walk toward the palace, his guards falling in around him.

Sphrantzes lingers, glancing at Juan with an expression that is difficult to read.

One more thing, Emperor. Where can my men assemble? Is there a field within the walls that I can use?

11 dec 2025

Weighed Emperor's dignity against practical hospitality obligations



The Emperor pauses mid-stride. He does not turn fully, but glances back over his shoulder.

"Five hundred knights and their horses." His voice is neutral again—practical matters are easier than questions of courage. "The Hippodrome is rubble and weeds now, but the ground is flat. It will serve for assembly and drill."

He hesitates, then adds:

"Your men already serving on the walls—Don Juan de Sotomayor's company—they are quartered near the Gate of Charisius. Sphrantzes will arrange for your forces to join them, or to remain separate, as you prefer."

A slight pause.

"The Hippodrome is... it was once the heart of the city. Chariot races. Imperial ceremonies. A hundred thousand Romans cheering." His voice is distant. "Now it is empty. But perhaps it is fitting that Castilian crusaders should gather where emperors once celebrated victories."

He resumes walking.

"Sphrantzes will see to the details. Rest. We will speak tonight."

The Emperor disappears into the palace. Sphrantzes steps closer to Juan, his voice low.

"That was... boldly done, Your Majesty." His tone is carefully neutral—neither approval nor criticism. "The Emperor does not hear such words often. Perhaps not ever."

He gestures toward a waiting cluster of servants.

"Shall I show you and your family to your quarters? And then I will make arrangements for your knights at the Hippodrome."

Sphrantzes waits, watching Juan with thoughtful eyes.

Show my family to the palace indeed. 

I arrange for all my crusaders to assemble in the hippodrome. We will present ourselves there. All the knights in the city will gather there. The knights of my company, the 34 knights who were delayed by the sickness in Barcelons and the 300 already there. We assemble everyone under the white banner. 

Dear Sphrantzes, would you like the honour of attending us when we present ourselves? We have sworn to come here some time ago, bear witness to us as we fulfill our oath.

11 dec 2025

Reconciled knight numbers and orchestrated ceremonial assembly scene











Sphrantzes's composure flickers. For a moment, the careful diplomat is replaced by something more vulnerable—a man who has spent years begging Western courts for help, watching promises evaporate, carrying impossible hopes back to a dying city.

"The honor, Your Majesty, would be mine."

He bows—deeper than protocol requires.

"I have witnessed many things in my years of service. Emperors crowned. Treaties signed. Promises made and broken." He straightens, and there is something bright in his eyes. "I have never witnessed an oath fulfilled. Not from the West. Not like this."

He clears his throat, recovering his professional bearing.

"I will send word to Don Juan de Sotomayor immediately. His three hundred will be eager to see their king—and to stand beside their brothers. The thirty-four who arrived last month from Barcelona are quartered with them."

Sphrantzes pauses, calculating.

"Nine hundred and fifteen knights, Your Majesty. Assembled under the white banner in the Hippodrome of Constantinople." A faint smile crosses his face. "The city will see. The Emperor will see. And the Ottoman spies will write very interesting reports tonight."

He gestures toward the palace.

"Let me see your family settled first. Then I will personally guide you to the Hippodrome."

Does Juan wish to add anything before the assembly?

I quickly go to the palace and don my armour. I also check if Catalina and Lucia are getting settled in comfortably.

11 dec 2025

Orchestrated scene depicting armor preparation and family reunion



The Palace of Blachernae — Afternoon

The palace is a study in faded glory. The corridors are vast, the ceilings painted with saints and emperors whose gold leaf has flaked away over centuries. Tapestries hang on the walls—magnificent work, but threadbare in places, carefully arranged to hide the worst of the wear.

Servants move quietly, efficient despite their patched clothing. They have clearly been instructed to give the Castilian king every courtesy the empire can still muster.

The Royal Quarters

Lucia stands at a window overlooking the city, Catalina on her hip. The room is large—once opulent, now merely comfortable. A fire has been lit. Fresh linens have been laid on the bed. A bowl of fruit and a flagon of wine wait on a side table.

"Juan." Lucia turns as he enters. Her eyes take in his expression, reading him as she always does. "The Emperor. How was he?"

Catalina squirms, reaching for her father. "Papá! Grande casa!" She gestures at the room, impressed by the sheer size of it despite its faded grandeur.

Doña Beatriz and the other ladies are unpacking trunks in an adjoining chamber. The sounds of domestic bustle filter through the doorway.

Lucia lowers her voice.

"The servants are kind, but frightened. I can see it in their eyes. They look at us like we are either saviors or another disappointment waiting to happen."

Lucia watches Juan, waiting.

We will see love. I will speak with the emperor. I do not know yet how much we can help them. This is what a dying empire looks like. It makes me sad. 

I need to don my armour fast, my knights are assembling. Would you like to come as well? Or stay here. We assemble in the old hippodrome.

11 dec 2025

Deliberated character consistency amid competing domestic and military obligations




Lucia considers for a moment, glancing at Catalina, then back at Juan.

"Nine hundred knights assembling to fulfill a sacred oath in the heart of Constantinople." A slight smile touches her lips. "I think I would regret missing such a thing for the rest of my life."

She sets Catalina down, and the child immediately toddles toward Juan's legs.

"Catalina should see it too. She will not remember it, but one day we will tell her she was there. When Papá and his knights stood in the Hippodrome where emperors once stood."

Lucia moves toward her trunks, already thinking practically.

"I will not need long. Something dignified but simple—this is your moment, not mine. The Queen of Castile watching from the side, not demanding attention."

She pauses, looking at him.

"Go. Don your armor. I will be ready when you are."

Catalina tugs at Juan's leg, looking up with serious eyes.

"Papá wearing metal clothes?"

Does Juan wish to say anything to Catalina, or proceed to armor up?

I don my armour and go to the hippodrome.

11 dec 2025

Orchestrated grand assembly of crusading knights at historic venue




The Hippodrome of Constantinople — Late Afternoon

The armor feels right. The weight of it, the familiar embrace of steel and leather. Juan has worn this armor through the sieges of Granada, through the final conquest, through the Te Deum in the Alhambra. Now it will witness another moment.

The Hippodrome is a ghost of what it was.

The great arena that once held a hundred thousand screaming Romans is now an expanse of packed earth and wild grass. The spina—the central spine around which chariots once raced—is gone, its treasures looted centuries ago. The tiered seating has crumbled into rubble, colonized by weeds and the occasional scraggly tree.

But the space remains. Vast. Open. Haunted by echoes of glory.

And filling it now: knights.

They have assembled in formation. The veterans of Granada—five hundred and eighty-one who sailed from Castile—stand in ordered ranks, their white surcoats bright against the ancient stones. Beside them, the three hundred under Don Juan de Sotomayor, weathered from months of garrison duty on Constantinople's walls. And there, a smaller cluster—the thirty-four who recovered from illness in Barcelona and followed after.

Nine hundred and fifteen knights. Under the white banner with its red cross, snapping in the afternoon breeze.

Don Juan de Sotomayor stands at the front of his company—a hard-faced man in his forties, his armor showing the wear of long service. When he sees Juan approaching, he barks a command. The ranks straighten. Silence falls.

Sphrantzes walks beside Juan, his face unreadable but his eyes bright.

Lucia follows with Catalina in her arms, accompanied by two guards. They take a position to the side, watching.

And beyond the Hippodrome's broken walls, faces appear. Byzantine citizens, drawn by the commotion. Soldiers from the walls. Merchants. Children. They line the ruins, watching the foreign knights in their white and red.

The assembly waits. Nine hundred and fifteen men who swore an oath years ago, now standing in the city they swore to defend.

What does Juan do?

GM: Question; do soldiers in this period in history use trumpets or bugels as military instruments? Would the crusaders carry with them drums or horns?

11 dec 2025

Examined historical military instruments appropriate for 1430s crusaders




Historical Note: Military Instruments, 1430s

Yes, military instruments were common in this period:

Trumpets — The primary instrument of medieval armies. Long, straight brass instruments (not the coiled trumpets of later centuries). Used for signaling commands in battle, announcing the presence of royalty, and ceremonial occasions. Every king would travel with trumpeters. The clarion was a common variant.

Drums — Nakers (small paired kettledrums, adopted from the Arabs during the Crusades) and tabors (small snare-like drums) were used. Drums were particularly associated with crusading armies due to Middle Eastern influence.

Horns — Hunting horns and olifants (carved from elephant ivory, rare and prestigious) existed but were less common for military ceremony than trumpets.

A Castilian royal expedition of this importance would certainly include:

Royal trumpeters (likely 4-8 men)
Drummers with nakers or tabors
Standard bearers
The combination of trumpets and drums for announcing a royal presence or calling assembly was well-established by this period. The sound carried far and signified authority.

Do you wish to incorporate instruments into the assembly scene?

I let the drums and the trumpets announce our presence for a moment before I adress the men.

11 dec 2025

Orchestrated atmospheric scene-setting, deliberately withholding character dialogue



The Hippodrome of Constantinople — The Assembly

Juan raises his hand.

The trumpeters lift their instruments—long brass clarions that catch the afternoon light. The drummers ready their nakers, the paired kettledrums hanging at their waists.

A moment of silence. The wind stirs the white banner.

Then the sound.

The trumpets cry out first—a clear, piercing note that echoes off the ancient walls of the Hippodrome, rolls across the ruins, carries out over the city. It is the sound of Castile. The sound of kings. The sound that preceded the assault on Granada's walls.

The drums join in—a deep, steady rhythm like a heartbeat. Like marching feet. Like the pulse of an army that has crossed the world to stand in this place.

The Byzantines watching from the broken walls freeze. Some cross themselves. Others simply stare. This sound—this Western sound—has not been heard in Constantinople in living memory. Not like this. Not with purpose.

The knights stand motionless, ranks perfect, eyes forward. Nine hundred and fifteen men who have fought together, bled together, sailed across the Mediterranean together. The veterans of Granada beside the garrison of Constantinople. United under one banner.

The trumpets cry again—three long notes, the traditional announcement of royalty.

Then silence.

The echo fades into the afternoon air. The banner snaps. The knights wait.

Lucia watches from the side, Catalina's eyes wide with wonder at the sound.

Sphrantzes stands frozen, something glistening in his eyes.

Nine hundred and fifteen knights stand ready. The Hippodrome waits. What does Juan say?

Brothers!

One year ago, I made a promise to help Constantinople in it's hour of need. Words sometimes ring hollow when they are not followed up by action. But not today! We stand here in this ancient place to hold our oaths fulfilled. We have promised to come and we came. 

We are strong and determined but the task before us is monumentous. We face the Ottomans, an enemy that not only outnumbers us, but is also more advanced in terms of organization, science and land. 

Long has been our journey and we have already seen many of the Lord's wonders. We have been tested and...some of our number have already fallen. 

But we have preservered. We have carried on. We took up the challenge and we have adapted. We have trained and drilled. We are now more ready then we were when we departed. We will continue to adapt, improve and train. And if we adapt and train enough, and when enough sweat and blood has been spilled we may yet be deserving of victory. 

Victory...seems so long away. We stand in the ruins of the hippodrome. A location that was once great. We are in a city that has been hollowed out, a city that was once the jewel of the world. 

We do not shy away from what is in front of us for it is the plain truth for it does not help us. Instead, we are here to show the Byzantines and the world that the light has not gone out in the east. That christians remember their brotherhood, even after being apart for centuries. 

We are here to say: Not yet and not today! Not as long as we draw breath shall the flame be snuffed out. Not as long as there is a sword and an arm to carry it. 

Non Nobis Domine!

PERSUASION ROLL: Juan's Address to the Knights

Success Factors:

The oath has been fulfilled—915 knights stand as living proof
Honest acknowledgment of the challenge ahead (not empty boasting)
Honors the fallen, showing he values his men
Connects to Byzantine identity and former glory
"Non Nobis Domine"—the crusader motto, deeply resonant
The setting itself amplifies the moment
Trumpets and drums have already set the emotional tone
Juan wears the armor of Granada—a conqueror who keeps promises
Failure Factors:

Byzantines are deeply skeptical of Western words after centuries of betrayal
Acknowledging the city as "hollowed out" could be taken as insult
Religious divide between Catholic and Orthodox remains
Knights are weary from long voyage
Words are easy; the real test lies ahead
Roll	Reaction
1-10	Flat. The speech lands poorly. Knights respond with dutiful but hollow repetition. Byzantines watch in silence, unconvinced. A forgettable moment.
11-25	Muted. The knights respond adequately, but exhaustion dulls the fire. Byzantine onlookers remain skeptical—more Western words. Polite but distant.
26-40	Respectful. Knights answer with proper fervor. Some Byzantines nod, willing to wait and see. A decent showing, but not transformative.
41-55	Solid. "Non Nobis Domine" echoes strongly from the ranks. Byzantines murmur among themselves—this is different, perhaps. Seeds of hope planted.
56-70	Powerful. The knights roar the response. Byzantine watchers fall silent, moved despite themselves. The moment will be discussed in taverns tonight.
71-85	Stirring. The Hippodrome thunders with the knights' voices. Byzantine soldiers on the walls hear it. Citizens weep. Something has shifted in the city's spirit.
86-95	Unforgettable. The response shakes the ancient stones. Byzantines kneel. The story spreads through Constantinople within hours—the Western king who came.
96-100	Legendary. A moment that will be remembered for generations. The city believes again. Even the cynics fall silent. Something has awakened in Constantinople.

The Hippodrome — The Response

For a heartbeat, silence.

Then Don Juan de Sotomayor draws his sword—the rasp of steel against leather cutting through the air. He raises it high.

"Non Nobis Domine!"

The cry is taken up. First by his three hundred, the men who have stood on Constantinople's walls for months, who have watched the city slowly die and wondered if anyone would ever come. Their voices crack with emotion.

"NON NOBIS DOMINE!"

Then the rest—the veterans of Granada, the sailors turned soldiers, the men who followed Juan across the Mediterranean. Nine hundred voices rising together, swords lifted, the ancient words of the Templars echoing off stones that have not heard such a sound in centuries.

"NON NOBIS DOMINE! NON NOBIS DOMINE!"

The white banner snaps in the wind. The drums thunder once more—a single, emphatic beat.

On the broken walls of the Hippodrome, the Byzantines watch.

They do not cheer. They do not kneel. These are people who have heard Western promises before—at Nicopolis, at Varna, in a dozen lesser betrayals. Their faces are guarded, their arms folded.

But they do not leave.

An old woman in a faded shawl murmurs something to her neighbor. A soldier in worn Byzantine armor leans forward, studying the assembled knights with narrowed eyes. A priest clutches his wooden cross, his lips moving in silent prayer.

They are watching. Weighing. Wondering if this time—this time—might be different.

Sphrantzes stands near Lucia, his composure cracked. His eyes are wet, though no tears fall.

"Seeds," he says quietly, almost to himself. "Only seeds. But seeds are how forests begin."

Catalina, in her mother's arms, has gone very still. Her dark eyes are fixed on her father in his gleaming armor, standing before the sea of white-clad knights. She does not understand what is happening, but she knows it is important.

"Papá," she whispers.

The assembly holds. What does Juan do next?

I tell the captain to get the men settled in and that I will talk with the emperor soon and we will make a plan on what to do next. 

I get back to the palace and get back into my clothes and go to get dinner with the emperor with Lucia.

Don Juan de Sotomayor salutes crisply as Juan gives the order.

"Your Majesty. The men will be settled by nightfall. Those from the walls know the city—they'll help the new arrivals find their footing." He pauses, something unspoken in his eyes. "It is good to see you, sire. The men... we had begun to wonder if anyone remembered us."

He turns and begins barking orders. The formation breaks into organized movement—sergeants directing companies, veterans of the walls guiding their newly-arrived brothers toward quarters.

The Royal Quarters — Early Evening

The armor comes off piece by piece. Servants assist—Byzantine attendants who handle the unfamiliar Castilian plate with careful hands. Juan's court clothes are laid out, brushed clean of travel dust.

Lucia is already dressed—elegant but restrained, as she promised. Deep blue silk, her hair bound simply. She watches Juan in the mirror as her ladies make final adjustments.

"The assembly," she says quietly. "I could hear them from where I stood. Non Nobis Domine." She pauses. "The Byzantines watching—they wanted to believe. You could see it in their faces. They just... couldn't. Not yet."

Catalina has been fed and put to bed, exhausted by the day's wonders. Doña Beatriz will watch over her.

The room is small by imperial standards—intimate, even. A single table set for four: the Emperor, Juan, Lucia, and an empty place setting.

John VIII rises as they enter. He has changed from his formal purple into simpler robes—still rich, but less ceremonial. His crown is absent. He looks... tired. Human.

"King Juan. Queen Lucia." He bows his head to each in turn. "Thank you for joining me."

He gestures to the table.

"My wife sends her regrets. The Empress Maria is... unwell this evening. She hopes to meet you tomorrow."

The food is simple but well-prepared—fish, bread, olives, wine. The plates are gold, ancient and beautiful, but there is not much on them. The empire's poverty extends even to the imperial table.

The Emperor sits, waiting for his guests to join him.

"I watched your assembly from the walls," he says quietly, pouring wine. "The Hippodrome has not heard such sounds in a very long time."

He looks at Juan.

"You meant what you said. About not shying away from the truth."

The Emperor waits, studying Juan over the rim of his cup.

So emperor, I have sent my men in advance, and also to deliver a message. 

That I see three main options for Constantinople. Refuge in Castille, share authority and fight with us, or give up nothing and fight alone. 

Has the emperor given these options thought?

11 dec 2025

Calibrated Emperor's diplomatic posture and internal motivations








The Emperor sets down his cup. His face remains composed, but something flickers behind his eyes—the wariness of a man who has been thinking about little else.

"I have given them thought," he says carefully. "As has my council. As has the Patriarch, though he was not pleased to be consulted on such matters."

He picks up an olive, studies it, sets it down without eating.

"Refuge in Castile." He lets the words hang. "My family has held Constantinople for two centuries. Before us, other dynasties stretching back to Constantine. Eleven hundred years of Roman emperors."

He looks at Juan directly.

"You ask me to consider becoming a guest in a foreign court. My children growing up speaking Castilian, forgetting Greek. The Palaiologos name becoming a curiosity, a relic, a bloodline that once meant something."

He takes a slow breath.

"And yet. My city starves. My walls crumble. My treasury is empty. My people look to me for salvation, and I have none to give."

The Emperor reaches for his wine again.

"The third option—fight alone, preserve our pride, die on the walls. There is honor in it. The monks would approve. The Patriarch would bless us as we fell."

His voice hardens slightly.

"But I have a son. And I find I am not yet ready to choose a glorious death over his future."

He pauses, his eyes fixed on Juan.

"Which leaves your second option. Share authority and fight together."

The words come slowly, deliberately.

"What does that mean, King of Castile? Precisely?"

The Emperor waits, his dinner untouched, his full attention on Juan.

Let me first put the refuge option in another perspective. What we coud do is make you Duke of Grenada. I have put a governor in place after the crusade but have not given away the title yet. You and your family could live in the Alhambra, a palace that is maybe even more prestigeous than my own palace in Toledo. Your people can settle there, preserve your culture and language. You would be a duke serving me of course. But there is a real future in this. 

Now, in regards to the option of fighting. We must be careful in this regard. I understand that Constantinople is happy for any help offered, but I cannot and will not demand the Castillian sons to die for a lost cause. My thousand knights may only delay the inevitable, not turn the tide. 

In your opinion, what will turn the tide? What will be needed?

11 dec 2025

Calibrated Emperor's conflicted response to refuge offer and strategic inquiry








The Emperor is silent for a long moment.

"Duke of Granada."

He repeats the words slowly, as if tasting something unfamiliar. His expression is impossible to read—pride warring with pragmatism, dignity wrestling with desperation.

"The Alhambra. Yes, I have heard of it. A Moorish palace of great beauty, taken by the king who now offers it as... compensation." He pauses. "For eleven centuries of Roman rule."

He does not say yes. He does not say no. He sets the words aside like a dish he is not yet ready to taste.

"You speak of your Castilian sons. Of not spending their lives on a lost cause." The Emperor's fingers trace the rim of his cup. "A wise king counts costs. I do not fault you for it."

He looks up, and there is something sharp in his gaze now. Testing.

"You ask me what will turn the tide. What will be needed."

He leans back in his chair.

"You are the king who conquered Granada in two years. Who reformed the Church. Who commands the respect of popes and princes." A slight gesture with his hand. "You have studied war. You have won wars. You have crossed the Mediterranean with a thousand knights to see this city with your own eyes."

The Emperor's voice drops.

"What do you think will be needed, King Juan? You have seen my walls. You have seen my treasury. You have seen my people. Tell me—what does the conqueror of Granada see when he looks at Constantinople?"

The Emperor watches Juan, waiting. He has not answered the question. He has turned it back.

I have sailed acress the seas and have lost one in ten of my best men to a storm. And even if I could just march my armies into Ottoman lands, even then could they field an army larger and better trained than what I can field. 

What I see whan I look at the Byzantines is this: An old dying empire that is collapsing under the weight of it's once grand glory and prestige. Is everyone in your empire prepared to fight tooth and nail to drive the Ottomans out? Will the nobles, the clergy be prepared to consolidate power and unite in this purpose?

11 dec 2025

Weighed Emperor's defensive posture against uncomfortable truths about Byzantine dysfunction







The Emperor's face goes still.

For a long moment, he does not speak. The fire crackles. Somewhere in the palace, a door closes. Lucia sits quietly, watching the exchange like a chess match.

When John VIII finally speaks, his voice is low. Controlled.

"You ask if everyone is prepared to fight tooth and nail."

He picks up his wine cup, stares into it.

"No."

The word hangs in the air.

"The nobles. Some would fight. Others count their estates and calculate whether Ottoman rule might preserve their lands better than a war that could destroy everything. They whisper among themselves. They hedge. They send secret messages to the Sultan's court, testing the waters."

He drinks.

"The clergy. The Patriarch and his monks would rather see Constantinople fall than see it saved by Latin hands. They preach that union with Rome is worse than Turkish conquest. Better the Sultan's turban than the Pope's tiara." His voice is bitter. "They say this from their monasteries while my soldiers die on the walls."

He sets the cup down hard.

"And the people. The common people. They are tired, King Juan. Tired of war, tired of poverty, tired of emperors who promise salvation and deliver nothing. Some would fight. Others would open the gates tomorrow if it meant bread and peace."

The Emperor meets Juan's eyes.

"You ask if we are united. We are not. We have not been united in generations. That is the truth you came here to see."

He pauses.

"Now. Does that change your calculation?"

The Emperor waits, his admission hanging between them like a blade.

If that is the case, how would you frame the question I would have to ask of Castillian sons who have to fight in a foreign land to conquer lands, increase the welth of those who do not want to fight themselves?

11 dec 2025

Examined Emperor's predicament and crafted honest response to uncomfortable question








The Emperor opens his mouth. Closes it.

For the first time since Juan arrived, John VIII Palaiologos looks truly lost.

He stares at the table. At the meager food on golden plates. At the wine in ancient cups. The trappings of empire without the substance.

"I..."

He stops. Tries again.

"You are asking me to justify..." He shakes his head slowly. "To explain why your sons should bleed for those who will not bleed for themselves."

Silence.

"I have spent nine years seeking Western aid. Writing letters. Sending ambassadors. Promising union with Rome. Offering what little we have." His voice is hollow. "I never once considered how those requests sounded to the men who would actually have to fight."

He looks at Juan.

"I have no answer for you."

The admission seems to cost him something. His shoulders sag almost imperceptibly.

"If I were a Castilian soldier—young, strong, with a family waiting at home—and my king asked me to die for a city whose own people cannot agree whether it should be saved..." He exhales. "I would ask why."

The fire pops. The Emperor stares into it.

"So perhaps that is your answer, King Juan. Perhaps there is no answer. Perhaps Constantinople is already dead, and we are simply too proud to lie down."

His eyes return to Juan, dark and weary.

"Unless you see something I do not."

The Emperor waits. Not with hope, exactly. But with the stillness of a man who has finally stopped pretending.

All you can do is offer people a choice. If they want to join the Sultan and be under muslim rule, that is their choice. 

We would have to drive the turks from lands that used to be Byzantibe clay. If these lands would be returned to the empire, others would have been doing the fighting while all rewards go to you. That would simply be not fair. We would need to set up a strong alliance with rewards and titles to those risking their lives and who actually bled for it. And the nobles and the church would need to give up their privilege and be prepared to support this effort. 

The alternative is move the city to Grenada like I just mentioned. Or stay... but I will not. 

Can we put this choice before your empire? So that they may choose?

11 dec 2025

Analyzed Emperor's psychological state and anticipated his conflicted reaction










The Emperor is quiet for a long moment.

Lucia's eyes move between the two men. She has not spoken all evening, but her attention has not wavered.

"Put this choice before my empire."

John VIII repeats the words slowly, turning them over.

"You mean summon the nobles. The clergy. The people, perhaps. And tell them—" He pauses. "Tell them that Western aid comes with conditions. That those who fight will be rewarded with Byzantine lands. That those who do not fight will lose their privileges. That the alternative is exile or death."

He rises from the table, moving to the window. The city spreads below, dark except for scattered torches and the distant glow of the Italian quarters—still barricaded, still hostile.

"Do you know what would happen, King Juan?"

He does not turn around.

"The nobles would rage. They would call it conquest dressed as alliance. They would say the Western king comes not to save Constantinople but to carve it up for his followers." A pause. "Some of them would be right."

He turns.

"The Patriarch would denounce it from every pulpit. He would say I am selling the empire to Catholic wolves. That I am betraying Orthodoxy, betraying our ancestors, betraying God himself."

His voice is flat, reciting facts.

"And the people..." He shakes his head. "The people would be divided. Some would see hope. Others would see the final humiliation."

He returns to the table but does not sit.

"You ask if we can put this choice before the empire. The question is not can we." His eyes meet Juan's. "The question is whether anything would survive the asking."

The Emperor stands, waiting.

We should come up with a complete plan on how this would look like. And if the Byzantines would regard it like betrayal and the Castillians would regard it like fighting for someone else at their own expense, then there is simply no saving the city and the empire.

11 dec 2025

Weighed Emperor's conflicting desires against diplomatic realities







The Emperor slowly sinks back into his chair.

"A complete plan."

He reaches for his wine, drinks deeply, sets the cup down.

"Very well. Let us speak plainly then, as men who have no time for courtly dances."

He folds his hands on the table.

"You speak of rewards and titles for those who fight. Of nobles and clergy giving up privilege." His eyes are steady on Juan. "But you have not yet said what Castile wants. What you want."

He leans forward slightly.

"You have crossed the Mediterranean. You have brought a thousand knights. You speak of driving the Turks from Byzantine lands. This is not charity, King Juan. No king spends such treasure, risks such lives, for nothing."

A pause.

"If we are to build this plan together—if we are to present it to my nobles, my clergy, my people—then I must understand what shape it takes. What does Castile gain? What do you gain?"

His voice carries no accusation. Only the weariness of a man who has learned that every gift has a price.

"Tell me what you see. This alliance, this... confederation of crowns. Where does Constantinople stand in it? Where does the Emperor stand?"

The Emperor waits, watching Juan with eyes that have seen too many negotiations to expect anything for free.

First of all, the 1000 knights and the 60.000 florins are a gift. I require nothing in return. 

Secondly, I do not require you to change religion. So no bowing down to the pope in Rome, you keep your religion such as it is. If ever the two churches want to come together, then it should be done out of genuine want, not out of desperation. 

Now, so far both the current situation and my offer of refuge in Castille. 

My question to Byzantine people is. Is there a problem? Do you require aid? Help to fight a fight you cannot win on your own. If the answer is that this is indeed the case, then I will take charge of the defence. That means no more hiding behind privilege and ancient agreement. Agreements that will be lost anyway when the city falls to the sultan. Whatever is left of the Byzantine empire will become part of the alliance between Aragon, Naples, Castille and Portugal. Only then will we be able to turn the tide. We in Iberia know what it is like to fight a reconquista and can teach you how to do the same. But if we are to bleed for someone else, we will only do so on our terms. So it means giving up pride and authority to let me lead the defence. I know that this is a difficult choice, but I want you to understand that this is not a demand at all. I offer you whatever I can give without asking for anything else in return. And consider the situation from our perspective and hopefully you and the others can see that I am sincere in what I offer. If you choose not to fight with us, then nothing is lost, everything I have given you stays here as a gift and my promise for refuge stays.

Evaluated persuasion mechanics against Byzantine identity stakes









PERSUASION ROLL: Juan's Proposal for Alliance

Success Factors:

1000 knights and 60,000 florins as unconditional gift — removes appearance of coercion
No religious submission demanded — addresses deepest Byzantine fear
Framed as choice, not demand — preserves imperial dignity
Honest about Castilian perspective — "why should our sons die for your privilege?"
Genuine alternative offered (Granada refuge) — not "submit or die"
References Reconquista experience — shows understanding of generational struggle
Juan has already proven himself — Granada, kept promises, came when he said he would
Acknowledges difficulty openly — treats Emperor as intelligent adult
Failure Factors:

Asking Emperor to surrender command authority — enormous identity threat
"I will take charge of the defence" — Emperor becomes subordinate in his own capital
1100 years of Byzantine pride and Roman continuity at stake
Nobles and clergy will oppose regardless of framing
Even if Emperor accepts personally, can he deliver his people?
Byzantine memory of Fourth Crusade — "Western help" has meant conquest before
Roll	Reaction
1-10	Pride overwhelms reason. The Emperor cannot hear past "give up authority." He grows cold, formal. Thanks Juan for his generosity but makes clear Constantinople will chart its own course. The conversation ends. Damage to relationship.
11-20	Defensive withdrawal. The Emperor acknowledges Juan's sincerity but cannot bring himself to consider surrender of command. He deflects, speaks of "consulting advisors," creates distance. No progress.
21-35	Conflicted resistance. The Emperor argues back—surely there is another way? Shared command? Advisory role? He is looking for escape from the binary choice. Negotiation possible but difficult.
36-50	Grudging consideration. The Emperor does not accept, but he stops arguing. He admits the logic. He asks for time to think, to consult. The door remains open, but he cannot commit tonight.
51-65	Painful honesty. The Emperor admits he sees no flaw in Juan's reasoning. He speaks of his own doubts, his failing options. He does not accept, but he engages seriously with how such a plan might work.
66-80	Genuine engagement. The Emperor sets aside pride and begins discussing practicalities—how would authority transfer work? What would nobles retain? How would it be presented? Real planning begins.
81-90	Relief beneath the pain. The Emperor recognizes Juan has offered something no Western prince ever has—a genuine choice with genuine respect. He accepts the framework in principle and commits to presenting it to his council.
91-95	Trust earned. The Emperor sees Juan clearly—not as conqueror but as potential partner. He accepts the proposal and asks Juan to stand beside him when he presents it to the nobles and clergy.
96-100	Transformation. Something shifts fundamentally. The Emperor stops seeing this as surrender and starts seeing it as salvation. He commits fully, personally, and asks how they begin tomorrow.
Ready to roll when you give the word.

O my God. Rolled 97. Unbelievable.

11 dec 2025

Orchestrated pivotal character transformation through psychological authenticity





Transformation

The Emperor does not respond immediately.

He sits motionless, his hands flat on the table, staring at Juan. The fire crackles. The wine grows warm. Lucia watches in silence.

When John VIII finally moves, it is to press his palms against his eyes. His shoulders tremble—just once.

When he lowers his hands, his eyes are wet.

"All my life," he says, his voice rough, "I have waited for the West to save us. My father waited. His father waited. We sent ambassadors. We promised union with Rome. We debased ourselves before popes and princes who smiled and nodded and gave us nothing."

He stands abruptly, turning away, one hand gripping the back of his chair.

"And when aid did come—at Nicopolis, at Varna—it came with arrogance. Western knights who knew better than us. Who would not listen. Who charged to their deaths and called it glory while we buried the consequences."

His voice cracks.

"I stopped believing anyone would come. I told myself I was being realistic. Pragmatic. I was preparing my son for a future of slow surrender, of managing decline, of—"

He stops.

Turns.

Looks at Juan with an expression stripped of all imperial dignity. Just a man. Exhausted. Desperate. And for the first time in years—hoping.

"You are not asking me to kneel. You are not asking me to betray my faith. You are offering me a choice. A real choice."

He moves around the table. Stops before Juan.

"No one has ever..." He shakes his head. "You could have demanded anything. You hold all the strength. And instead you say—if you do not want this, we part as friends."

The Emperor reaches out and grips Juan's arm.

"I have been emperor for nine years. I have never once felt like I had a true ally. Advisors, yes. Servants. Sycophants. Men who wanted something." His grip tightens. "But you—you came here to see. To understand. To offer without demanding."

He releases Juan's arm and steps back.

"Tomorrow. We begin tomorrow. I will summon the nobles, the clergy, the garrison commanders. I will tell them what you have told me—the choice before us. And I will ask you to stand beside me when I do."

His jaw sets.

"Some will refuse. The Patriarch may denounce us both. Nobles will scheme and threaten." A flicker of something almost like a smile. "But for the first time in nine years, I know what I am fighting for. Not just survival. Not just delay. But a future my son might actually live to see."

He looks at Lucia, then back at Juan.

"You asked what Constantinople needs to turn the tide. I did not answer." He draws a breath. "The answer is this. Someone who sees us as we are—broken, proud, failing—and still believes we are worth saving."

He extends his hand.

"Partners, King Juan. Not supplicant and savior. Partners."

The Emperor waits, his hand outstretched.

We will work together to give your people a choice. I shake his hand. 

Now, it's time to draft a plan for the defence of the empire. I need scribes and advisors who know of the current actual and legal situation. Let me do my work emperor, and see how I would lead the defence of our kingdoms. Do you have a cabinet? Now is the time to summon them. 

Lucia, please stay by my side.

11 dec 2025

Orchestrated practical transition from diplomacy to strategic planning with supporting cast





The Emperor clasps Juan's hand firmly. Something has changed in his bearing—the weariness remains, but beneath it now is purpose.

"A cabinet." He almost laughs. "What remains of one."

He moves to the door, opens it, speaks rapidly in Greek to the servants waiting outside. Footsteps scatter through the palace corridors.

"I will summon who we have. It will not take long—the palace is not so large anymore, and those who matter sleep close."

He turns back to Juan and Lucia.

"You will have scribes. Maps. What records we possess." A pause. "And you will have honesty. No more pretending we are stronger than we are."

The Cabinet Chamber — Night

Within the hour, they have assembled in a larger room. A fire blazes. Candles flicker on every surface. A great table dominates the center, and servants are unrolling maps—old maps, their edges frayed, their ink faded, but still legible.

Lucia sits beside Juan, her presence quiet but attentive. She has called for paper and ink—she will take her own notes.

The men who file in are few. The Emperor introduces them as they arrive:

Loukas Notaras — Megas Doux, Grand Admiral and the wealthiest man in Constantinople. Perhaps fifty, sharp-eyed, dressed in robes finer than the Emperor's. He bows correctly but his gaze is calculating.

Sphrantzes — already known to Juan. He takes a position near the Emperor, ready to translate or advise.

Demetrios Kantakouzenos — a military commander, grey-bearded, scarred, wearing worn armor even at this hour. He commands what remains of the Byzantine regular forces.

Patriarch Joseph II — an unexpected addition. Ancient, frail, leaning on a cane. His eyes are sharp beneath heavy brows. He has not been summoned—he has come, having heard of the Castilian king's presence.

The Emperor glances at the Patriarch but says nothing.

The men arrange themselves around the table. Maps of Constantinople, the Bosphorus, Thrace, and Anatolia spread before them.

The Emperor gestures to Juan.

"King Juan of Castile. He has come to help us plan our defense. And to understand our situation as it truly is."

Loukas Notaras speaks first, his Greek translated by Sphrantzes:

"And what authority does the King of Castile hold in this planning?"

The room waits. The question hangs in the air.

Yes, something like that. As you may know, I have already offered Constantinople aid as a gift. I ask notrhing i return. And I foresee three choices before us. 

I shall provide shelter and refuge for the Byzantines in my kingdom. There you can live in peace and preserve your religion and culture. But it means leaving Constantinople. 

If you do not want that, I leave my gifts behind and sail away so the empire can sail it's own course and maybe be absorbed by the muslims. 

Tonight we are planning for the third option. An option that asks tremendous sacrifice both in blood and in pride. It is an option, mind you. Not a demand, rather a choice the Byzantine people should make. A choice with alternatives, for a choice without an alternative is no choice at all. I say this because I know that what I am about to plan for, may sound outlandish, maybe even insulting to the proud and prestigeous people of the empire. I remind you again that we are planning for a choice, that this is not a demand. That I require authority not for personal gain or glory, but to unite everyone under one banner, one purpose. There simply is no time, space or room anymore for the old ways. We adapt or we die among ancient tradition. 

Now, firstly, Religion. Whatever will be discussed, the matter of the filique will not be. Now is not the time of religeous reform or mending of the scism. That may come later if it will come at all. But I require nothing from the church except for the support both in holy service as in monetary terms as we all will have to pay. 

Secondly. I am in command. Me and only me. I will lead not just the defence of Constantinople, I will also have to lead the crowns of Naples, Aragon, Castille and Portugal in this fight and negotiate alliances with other christian kingdoms such as Hungary, Poland and the holy Roman empire. I have led a reconquista before and will do so again. Part of the choice is if the Byzantine people trust me with the leadership. Remember, I am not demanding, it is a choice. 

Thirdly, I will require you to fight like devils. No more hiding behind walls, titles or privilege. Christianity fights for your empire, and you will fight the hardest of all. I will militarize the nobility and arm every citizen. Trade, the church and science will be geared towards warfare. Everyone fights. 

Tonight we will draft proposals that detail in more specific terms what I have just laid out. So we can present this choice to the empire. After it has been presented, I will wait and will let you make a choice awaiting whatever you decide. 

You have been summoned to help me and the emperor in doing just this. Is everyone in this room ready to proceed?

PERSUASION ROLL: Juan's Proposal to the Byzantine Cabinet

NPCs Present and Their Stakes:

Loukas Notaras (Megas Doux, wealthiest man in Constantinople)

What he wants: To preserve his wealth, position, and options
What he won't say: That he has likely already hedged bets with Ottoman contacts
Demetrios Kantakouzenos (Military commander)

What he wants: Clear leadership, resources to actually fight, competent command
What he won't say: How hopeless he believes the current military situation truly is
Patriarch Joseph II (Head of Orthodox Church, came uninvited)

What he wants: To protect Orthodoxy from Latin influence
What he won't say: Juan has defused his main objection—he may be uncertain now
Sphrantzes (Already somewhat sympathetic from journey)

What he wants: To save Constantinople
What he won't say: His private doubts about whether any plan can work
Success Factors:

Religious independence explicitly preserved—Patriarch's main weapon removed
Framed repeatedly as choice, not demand
Concrete alternatives offered (Granada refuge)
Juan's track record (Granada, kept promises, unconditional gifts)
Emperor clearly backing this—united front
Military commander likely appreciates clear chain of command
"Everyone fights"—appeals to desperate men who want action
Failure Factors:

"I am in command. Me and only me."—enormous authority threat
"Militarize the nobility"—threatens existing power structures
"Arm every citizen"—threatens social order wealthy depend on
Trade, church, science "geared towards warfare"—threatens comfortable arrangements
Sudden—no time to calculate, scheme, or prepare positions
Notaras has most to lose and most reason to obstruct
Patriarch came uninvited—what is he planning?
Byzantine instinct: look for hidden motives in everything
Roll	Reaction
1-10	Hostile rejection. Notaras or the Patriarch seizes control of the room. Accusations of Western conquest. The cabinet fractures before planning can begin. Tonight ends in argument.
11-20	Deep suspicion. Cold questions, defensive postures. They probe for hidden demands, refuse to engage constructively. The Emperor's support is not enough to move them tonight.
21-35	Reluctant obstruction. They do not refuse outright, but every point becomes an argument. Progress is glacial. By dawn, little has been accomplished.
36-50	Grudging participation. They engage, but guardedly. Each man protects his own interests. Planning proceeds slowly, with constant negotiation. A framework emerges, but fragile.
51-65	Cautious cooperation. The religious concession wins the Patriarch's silence, if not support. Notaras calculates but does not obstruct. Kantakouzenos engages on military matters. Real work begins.
66-80	Genuine engagement. The cabinet recognizes the Emperor's commitment and Juan's sincerity. Questions become practical, not hostile. By dawn, a real plan takes shape.
81-90	Unexpected unity. Something shifts in the room. Even Notaras sees opportunity rather than threat. The Patriarch offers cautious blessing. The military commander speaks freely. Momentum builds.
91-95	Transformation. Juan's words break through Byzantine cynicism. They begin to believe this might actually work. The cabinet commits to presenting a united front to the nobles.
96-100	Providence. The room becomes something greater than a planning session. Old rivals set aside grievances. A sense of shared purpose takes hold that has not existed in Constantinople for generations.
Ready to roll when you give the word.

Orchestrated hostile cabinet rejection with strategic opposition leaders







Hostile Rejection

Silence follows Juan's words.

It stretches. The fire pops. A candle gutters.

Then Loukas Notaras laughs.

It is not a pleasant sound. It is the laugh of a man who has heard something absurd and wishes everyone to know it.

"You are in command." He repeats the words in Greek, then again for Juan's benefit in accented Italian. "You. A Western king who arrived this afternoon. Who has never walked our walls. Who does not speak our tongue. Who knows nothing of Ottoman tactics, nothing of our treaties, nothing of our situation."

He leans forward, his fine robes rustling.

"And you expect us to hand you everything? Our armies, our treasury, our nobility, our—" He gestures broadly. "Our empire?"

Before Juan can respond, Patriarch Joseph II strikes his cane against the floor. The sharp crack silences the room.

"The Megas Doux speaks harshly, but he speaks truth." The old man's voice is thin but carries. Sphrantzes translates rapidly. "You say you demand nothing of the Church. You say the Filioque will not be discussed. Pretty words."

His eyes, rheumy but sharp, fix on Juan.

"But what you do demand is worse. You demand we place our faith—our survival—in a Latin king. A servant of the Pope, whatever you claim tonight. And when you have command of our armies, our walls, our people... what then?"

He gestures with a gnarled hand.

"The Fourth Crusade came to help us as well. They burned our libraries. They stole our relics. They put a Latin patriarch in the Hagia Sophia for sixty years." His voice rises. "And now another Westerner offers help. Offers choices. And we are to trust him?"

Demetrios Kantakouzenos shifts uncomfortably but says nothing. His eyes move between the Patriarch and the Emperor.

Notaras presses the advantage.

"Your Majesty," he addresses John VIII directly, ignoring Juan, "this is madness. We cannot hand our empire to a stranger on the basis of one dinner conversation. The nobles will never accept it. The people will riot. And when the Sultan hears that Constantinople has become a Castilian puppet—"

"Enough."

The Emperor's voice cuts through, but it is strained. He looks at Juan, then at his cabinet.

"King Juan is our guest. He has come farther than any Western prince to—"

"To what?" Notaras interrupts. "To conquer us with kindness instead of swords? The result is the same, Your Majesty. We become a province of Spain."

The Patriarch nods slowly, his cane tapping the floor.

"I came tonight to hear this Western king for myself. I have heard enough."

He turns, painfully slowly, toward the door.

The room is fracturing. The Patriarch is leaving. Notaras smells blood. Kantakouzenos waits to see which way the wind blows. The Emperor looks to Juan.

What does Juan do?

I slam my fist on the table. I get a bit angry myself. 

Demand? Conquer and subjugate Constantinople? I have been warned for Byzantine pride before but I chose not to believe it. 

Father Patriarch, leave if you must but know that I do not like my words twisted. I have not demanded anything. I have only given aid and respect. Me not demanding the Byzantines to trust me is the entire point of a choice. You heard that I demand this trust tonight, but that was not what I said. Tonight we develop a plan and offer it as a choice to you all. Then you can take time to get to know me and for me to know you. No choice tonight or tomorrow but later when we are ready. And if you choose to go your own way, I will bless you, leave my 60.000 florins in your care. And I will bid you farewell as I sail back to my kingdom. 

All I ask of this council is to help shape this plan. To at least give this choice a chance. For the Byzantines to have the chance to make a choice in the first place. I buried almost 100 of my men on my way here. I cannot help but heel like their deaths have been in vain if we just give up now.

Analyzed NPC reactions to emotional appeal and recovery attempt










RECOVERY ROLL: Juan's Defense

What's Changed:

Juan has shown emotion—anger, but controlled
He has clarified: choice, not demand
He has invoked the 100 dead Castilians—real sacrifice already made
He has reminded them he can simply leave with blessing
He is asking only to shape a plan, not for commitment tonight
Success Factors:

Genuine emotion can break through cynicism
The dead men are real—Byzantines understand sacrifice
Asking only to help shape a plan is minimal request
Emperor still supports Juan
Kantakouzenos (military man) may respond to talk of fallen soldiers
The Patriarch has not yet left the room
Failure Factors:

Slamming the table may confirm fears of Western aggression
"Byzantine pride" comment could be taken as insult
Patriarch and Notaras already committed to opposition
Byzantine court values composure—anger is weakness
Momentum is against Juan
Recovery from a roll of 6 is very difficult
Roll	Reaction
1-15	Total collapse. Juan's anger confirms their fears. The Patriarch leaves. Notaras follows. The cabinet dissolves. Tonight cannot be salvaged.
16-30	Bitter stalemate. The Patriarch pauses but does not return. Notaras remains hostile. No progress, but no further deterioration. The meeting ends in cold silence.
31-45	Grudging pause. Someone hesitates—perhaps Kantakouzenos. The Patriarch stops at the door. The room does not fracture completely, but trust is damaged.
46-60	Crack in the wall. Kantakouzenos speaks up—the military man moved by talk of dead soldiers. The Patriarch waits. Notaras is isolated momentarily. A thread remains.
61-75	Partial recovery. Juan's clarification lands. The Patriarch returns to his seat, grudgingly. They will hear more, but suspicion remains heavy.
76-85	Respect earned. Juan's emotion reads as genuine, not threatening. The room stabilizes. They agree to continue—cautiously. The plan can be shaped.
86-95	Turning point. Juan's passion breaks through. Even Notaras reconsiders. The Patriarch sits. Real discussion becomes possible again.
96-100	Reversal. The room transforms. What seemed disaster becomes foundation. Juan's willingness to fight for them—even against them—proves his sincerity.
Ready to roll when you give the word.

Navigated diplomatic impasse, prevented collapse, narrated stalemate



Bitter Stalemate

The Patriarch pauses at the door.

His gnarled hand rests on the frame. He does not turn fully, but his head tilts slightly—listening.

The silence stretches.

Then, slowly, he speaks. Sphrantzes translates, his voice barely above a whisper:

"One hundred men. Buried at sea."

The old man's shoulders rise and fall with a breath.

"I do not doubt your sacrifice, King of Castile. I do not doubt your sincerity."

He turns his head just enough that one rheumy eye meets Juan's.

"But sincerity is not wisdom. And sacrifice does not confer the right to command. Many sincere men have led armies to destruction. Many sacrifices have been made in vain."

He taps his cane once.

"I will not help shape a plan that places Constantinople under Latin authority. Not tonight. Not ever. If that is the only choice you offer, then we have nothing more to discuss."

He shuffles through the door. His footsteps echo down the corridor, fading into silence.

Notaras has not moved. His arms are folded, his expression cold.

"The Patriarch speaks for the Church. I speak for those who have wealth to lose." His voice is flat. "You ask us to give up everything on faith. Faith in a man we met today."

He glances at the Emperor.

"Your Majesty, I have served your family for thirty years. I will not abandon you. But I will not endorse this... proposal. Not as it stands."

He rises.

"When the King of Castile has a plan that does not require us to become his subjects, I will listen. Until then..."

He bows—correctly, but without warmth—and leaves.

The room is smaller now. The fire has burned low.

Kantakouzenos remains, his scarred face unreadable. Sphrantzes stands by the Emperor, pale and silent. Lucia sits beside Juan, her hand resting near his on the table.

The Emperor looks at the maps spread before them, then at Juan.

"That... could have gone better."

His voice is tired. Not accusatory. Simply exhausted.

Kantakouzenos clears his throat.

"The Patriarch will oppose anything that smells of Rome. He always has. Notaras will oppose anything that threatens his purse." The old soldier shrugs. "But they have not said no. Not finally. They have said not yet."

He looks at Juan.

"One hundred men buried at sea. My soldiers die on the walls every month. Fewer, but they die." He pauses. "I am not leaving this room, King of Castile. I want to hear your plan."

Kantakouzenos waits. The Emperor waits. The night is not over—but it hangs by a thread.

We continue. Summon another senior captain who wants to cooperate with this planning session, and likewise summon someone who can speak of the church and it's politics and position. These two have excluded themselves from this planning session, we go on without them.

Weighed realistic obstacles to summoning cooperative replacements







The Emperor and Kantakouzenos exchange a glance.

"Another captain." Kantakouzenos rubs his jaw. "I have men who would listen. Men who are tired of waiting to die." He nods slowly. "Alexios Philanthropenos. Commands the garrison at the Gate of Charisius—where your knights are quartered. He has worked alongside your Don Juan de Sotomayor. He respects the Castilians."

He looks to a servant by the door and barks an order in Greek. The man hurries out.

The Emperor's expression is more troubled.

"The Church is... more difficult." He steeples his fingers. "The Patriarch has made his position clear. Any priest who participates tonight without his blessing risks censure. Possibly excommunication."

Sphrantzes clears his throat.

"There is one possibility, Your Majesty." He hesitates. "Father Gennadios. He is not senior—a scholar more than a politician. But he has written extensively on the question of Western relations. He believes union with Rome is heresy, yet he has also argued that Orthodoxy must find ways to survive, not merely remain pure while dying."

The Emperor frowns. "Gennadios is... unpredictable."

"He is honest," Sphrantzes replies quietly. "And he is not afraid of the Patriarch."

Another servant is dispatched.

An Hour Later

The fire has been rebuilt. Fresh candles burn. Wine and bread have been brought—working fuel for a long night.

Two new men have joined the table.

Alexios Philanthropenos — A lean man in his thirties, dark-bearded, wearing armor that has seen real use. He carries himself like a soldier who has stopped caring about politics and only wants clear orders. He greets Juan with a short bow and a measuring look.

Father Gennadios Scholarios — Younger than expected, perhaps forty. Black robes, a scholar's ink-stained fingers, and eyes that burn with intelligence. He sits apart from the others, watching Juan like a man studying a theological problem.

Kantakouzenos makes introductions. Philanthropenos nods. Gennadios simply waits.

The Emperor gestures to the maps.

"Gentlemen. We are here to draft a plan—a proposal to present to our people. A choice." He glances at Juan. "King Juan will explain what he envisions. Listen. Ask questions. Help us shape something that might actually work."

Philanthropenos leans forward, studying the maps.

Gennadios speaks first, his Greek translated by Sphrantzes:

"I watched the Patriarch leave. I watched Notaras leave." His voice is calm, almost clinical. "You understand, King of Castile, that whatever we build tonight, those two will try to tear down tomorrow?"

The room waits for Juan to begin.

We will draft a plan for victory. Then we will see. I will see. 

I explain to the new members of the council again what we are about to set up. And that it is a choice, not a demand.

Calibrated reaction table favoring cooperative NPCs over hostile predecessors








PERSUASION ROLL: Second Council — Philanthropenos and Gennadios

NPC Stakes:

Alexios Philanthropenos (Military Commander, Gate of Charisius)

What he wants: Clear command, resources, a fighting chance
What he won't say: How close to despair his men truly are
Already favorable: Has worked with Castilian knights, respects them
Father Gennadios Scholarios (Scholar-Priest, Independent Thinker)

What he wants: Orthodoxy to survive—even if survival requires uncomfortable choices
What he won't say: How deeply he fears the Patriarch may be leading them to extinction
Already favorable: Intellectual honesty, willing to consider unorthodox solutions
Success Factors:

These men were chosen because they might cooperate
Smaller group, less posturing
Philanthropenos has seen Castilian knights in action—real evidence
Gennadios values survival over purity
"Choice not demand" framing preserved
Emperor, Kantakouzenos, Sphrantzes all committed
The opposition has left—no one to perform for
Failure Factors:

They know they are the "second string" council
Gennadios's warning: Patriarch and Notaras will oppose
Byzantine instinct for suspicion remains
Even cooperative men will have reservations
The earlier confrontation hangs over the room
Roll	Reaction
1-15	Polite skepticism. They listen, but do not truly engage. Questions are few, commitment absent. They will not obstruct, but neither will they help build anything tonight.
16-30	Cautious distance. They hear Juan out, ask probing questions, but make no commitments. The plan can be discussed, but trust is thin. Progress will be slow.
31-45	Professional engagement. Philanthropenos focuses on military practicalities; Gennadios raises theological concerns that need addressing. Real work begins, but carefully.
46-60	Growing interest. The "choice not demand" framing lands. Both men begin contributing ideas. A working draft becomes possible by dawn.
61-75	Genuine cooperation. Philanthropenos speaks freely about military needs; Gennadios offers insight into how to frame this for the faithful. The plan takes real shape.
76-85	Committed partnership. Both men recognize this may be Constantinople's last real chance. They invest fully. By dawn, a solid proposal exists.
86-95	Unexpected alliance. Gennadios offers to defend the plan to hesitant clergy. Philanthropenos pledges his garrison's support. The council becomes a true working body.
96-100	Foundation laid. What began as salvage becomes strength. This smaller council proves more effective than the full cabinet could have been. A real plan emerges—and real allies.
Ready to roll when you give the word.

Cautious Distance

Juan lays out the proposal again. The choice. The three options. The requirements for the third path—unified command, total mobilization, everyone fights.

Philanthropenos listens with his arms folded, his dark eyes fixed on the maps. His expression betrays nothing.

Gennadios sits with his ink-stained fingers steepled before his lips, watching Juan the way a theologian watches a disputant whose argument may contain hidden heresy.

When Juan finishes, silence settles over the room.

Philanthropenos speaks first. His Greek is clipped, military. Sphrantzes translates:

"You say unified command. You say you command." He taps the map—the Theodosian Walls stretching across the parchment. "I have four hundred men at the Gate of Charisius. Your Sotomayor has three hundred Castilians. Together, perhaps we could hold one section of the walls."

He traces the full length of the fortifications.

"Four miles of walls. Ninety-six towers. We would need ten thousand men to defend them properly. We have perhaps three thousand, including your knights."

He looks up at Juan.

"You speak of victory. Of driving back the Ottomans. With what? Where do these armies come from? How do they arrive before Murad decides the time has come?"

He is not hostile. But he is not convinced.

Gennadios shifts in his seat.

"The military questions are for soldiers. I have others."

His voice is soft, precise—the voice of a man accustomed to lecture halls.

"You say you demand nothing of the Church. You say the Filioque will not be discussed. This is... appreciated."

He pauses.

"But you also say the Church must contribute. Monetary terms, you said. Holy service." His eyes narrow slightly. "What does this mean, precisely? The monasteries own lands. The Patriarch controls revenues. If you militarize the nobility and arm every citizen, what happens to Church properties? Church privileges? Church authority over its own affairs?"

He spreads his hands.

"I am not the Patriarch. I do not reject cooperation with the West on principle. But I must understand what I would be defending before I defend it."

The Emperor watches, saying nothing. Kantakouzenos studies the maps. Sphrantzes waits to translate.

Lucia's pen hovers over her paper, ready to record.

Two questions hang in the air: Where do the armies come from? And what exactly does Juan require of the Church?

What does Juan say?

I am glad you question me like this!

To adress the military ones first: We do indeed require not 2000 more soldiers, not even 10.000 more. I will seek to lead an alliance of over 100.000 troops from multiple corners of Christianity. Castille commands around 50.000 troops but with the aid of my alliance network, I am sure we are able to raise this number. Holding the walls is not our goal. We will drive them from the European continent and break them in the field. The time to cower behind walls is over. I have founded an academy in Toledo that studies Ottoman tactics and these 1000 knights have been trained using the most modern techniques and 10 junior officers are here as observers to later lead the armies that will be fighting the Ottomans. 

And regarding the spiritual side. I will militarize the church as well. Take inspiration from how the latin church has won the reconquista. Military orders of warrior monks who dedicate their lives to fighting the muslims. Churches blessing warriors and collect money to func the effort. Crusades uniting churches and collect funds for these wars. Everyone fights. The church may not hold a sword, it fights in a different way.

Anticipated skeptical NPC reactions to ambitious military and ecclesiastical claims






Philanthropenos's expression shifts. Not quite belief—but the dismissiveness has faded. He leans forward.

"One hundred thousand."

He repeats the number slowly, as if tasting it.

"I have fought the Ottomans for fifteen years. I have seen what they bring to the field. Discipline. Janissaries who do not break. Sipahi cavalry that flows like water around any formation." He shakes his head slowly. "One hundred thousand Christians, united under one command, fighting as one army..."

He looks at Juan directly.

"If you could deliver such a thing, it would be the greatest host Christendom has assembled since the First Crusade." A pause. "But how? Castile is far. Aragon is entangled in Italy. Portugal faces Africa. Hungary bleeds against the Turks already. Poland looks east to the steppe."

His scarred hands rest on the map.

"I do not doubt your ambition, King of Castile. But ambition is not soldiers. Where do these hundred thousand men come from? When do they arrive? And what holds them together when they are here?"

Gennadios is quieter. His eyes have not left Juan's face.

"Military orders," he murmurs. Sphrantzes translates. "Warrior monks. The Templars. The Hospitallers. Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara."

He taps his fingers slowly on the table.

"The Latin church created these orders over centuries. They answered to the Pope. They held vast lands, vast wealth. They became powers unto themselves—until kings and popes destroyed them for that very reason."

His gaze sharpens.

"You propose to create such orders for the Orthodox church. In months, not centuries. Without papal authority to bind them. Without lands to sustain them." A thin smile. "And you expect the monasteries—who have guarded their independence for a thousand years—to simply... transform themselves into soldiers?"

He spreads his hands.

"I do not say it is impossible. I say I do not understand how you imagine it would work. The monks of Mount Athos would sooner burn their monasteries than take up swords. The Patriarch would excommunicate any priest who blessed such an order without his sanction."

He leans back.

"You speak of everyone fighting. But the Church fights with prayer, with teaching, with the preservation of sacred truth. If you wish to change that—if you wish Orthodox monks to become Latin-style warrior orders—you must explain how. And you must explain who would lead them, fund them, command them."

Both men wait. Not hostile. Not convinced. Testing.

What does Juan say?

Gennadios, yes yes, very good. But again, do not twist my words. I said TAKE INSPIRATION from the Latin church. Not copy it. You are here exactly because we need to figure out what this would look like in the ortodox tradition. Otherwise I could ask any of my catholic priests instead. Tonight we will ask ourselves: "If the Orthodox church would turn every effort into winning this war, what would that look like?". Can you help us answer that question Gennadios? 

And regarding the soldiers we do not have: Yes, I cannot snap my fingers and summon the Polish king into this room. We do not know what moves them. We hope to invite them into an alliance and attack the Ottomans together. That is why the structure we set up is so important. If I meet with them, I have the authority to bind the entire alliance. And that there is a structure that fighting the Ottomans actually is rewarded. The structure would be something like this: The kingdoms of Naples, Aragon, Castille and perhaps Portugal enter into a strong alliance of crowns. My family sits on these thrones so I hold much direct control over them already. Any lands taken from the Ottomans will be distributed using the crusade system. The reconquista, a concept familiar to the Iberians. The Poles and the Hungarians already border the Ottomans. I think it will not take much to convince them to attack with us. But only if we are serious about attacking them and the Ottomans are seriously occupied. That is why the structure is so important. If we attack them from all sides, Hungary and Poland gain lands and they press forward and what was once Greek lands will be reconquered. We may yet lose. We may yet be defeated. But if we have a good plan and the Byzantines choose to fight, I think we should.

Evaluated character reactions and pivoted toward narrative progression







Gennadios is silent for a long moment.

His ink-stained fingers tap once, twice, on the table. The scholar's mind is working—Juan can see it in his eyes. The challenge has been reframed from defend this proposal to help solve this puzzle.

"If the Orthodox church would turn every effort into winning this war," he repeats slowly. "What would that look like."

He glances at the ceiling, thinking aloud.

"The monasteries hold wealth. Lands. Gold. Relics that pilgrims pay to venerate." He pauses. "They could tithe for war. They have done so before, in centuries past, when emperors demanded it. The Patriarch would resist, but if the people believed the cause was holy..."

His eyes return to Juan.

"The monks will not become knights. That is not our tradition. But they could support knights. Pray for them. Bless them. Tend their wounded. Copy their letters. Preserve their names for history." A thin smile. "The monasteries were fortresses once, in darker times. Some still have walls. They could shelter refugees, store supplies, serve as waypoints."

He spreads his hands.

"And there is this: we have priests who fight. Not officially. Not with the Patriarch's blessing. But village priests who took up swords against raiders. Monks who died on the walls in sieges past. The tradition exists, even if we do not speak of it."

He leans forward.

"If you want the Orthodox church to fight—truly fight—you do not create military orders. You create a holy cause. A crusade in all but name. You have the Emperor proclaim that the defense of Constantinople is sacred duty. You have priests preach it from every pulpit. You have monks process through the streets with icons and relics, blessing the soldiers, cursing the enemy."

His voice drops.

"The Patriarch would hate it. But if the people believed... the Patriarch would have to follow or be swept aside."

Philanthropenos has been listening. Now he grunts.

"Multi-front war. Press them from all sides." He traces lines on the map—Hungary to the north, Constantinople to the south, the Aegean islands, Anatolia. "Sound strategy. The Ottomans are strong, but they cannot be everywhere. If Hungary strikes while we hold the straits, if Poland threatens their northern vassals..."

He looks up.

"But timing is everything. If we attack before the others are ready, we die alone. If they attack before we are ready, they die alone." He taps the table. "How do you coordinate armies separated by a thousand miles? How do you ensure the Hungarians do not make peace the moment they have taken what they want?"

He shakes his head.

"I have seen alliances. They promise much. They deliver little. Each king thinks first of his own lands, his own glory." His eyes meet Juan's. "What makes this different? What binds them?"

Two questions remain: How do you coordinate a multi-front war across a thousand miles? And what binds the alliance together when each king pursues his own interest?

The room waits.

Once we havbe proven we are a serious challenge to the Ottomans, I can let greed do much of the work. If the Ottomans are challenged neart Constantinople, soon, the kings of Poland and Hungry will see that the lands bordering them will be easy prey. It requires us to take up the sword first and they will not move until they have seen us match the Turks in the field and wil. But once we have, they will not be able to defend their northern border. Greed is a powerful ally. But we will have to stand on our own first, I have no doubt about it. That is why our plan is so important. We build up our strength, and sooner or later, others will decend on them as well.

11 dec 2025

Evaluated strategic logic and orchestrated NPC reactions accordingly








Philanthropenos exhales slowly through his nose.

"Greed." He almost smiles. "Yes. I have seen what greed does to alliances. It can tear them apart." He pauses. "But it can also bind them, if there is enough to go around."

He studies the map again—the vast Ottoman territories stretching across Anatolia, the Balkans, the lands that were once Greek, Bulgarian, Serbian.

"There is enough. If we truly threatened them, there would be enough for everyone." He taps the map. "Hungary wants Serbia back. Poland eyes the Black Sea coast. Venice wants its trading posts secure. Genoa..." He grimaces. "Genoa wants whatever Venice does not have."

He looks up at Juan.

"You say we must prove ourselves first. Match them in the field." His voice is flat, honest. "With what we have now—your thousand, my few thousand, the walls—we cannot meet them in open battle. We would be slaughtered."

He holds up a hand before Juan can respond.

"But. If we hold. If we bleed them at the walls. If we make the price too high..." He shrugs. "Murad is not a fool. He will not spend fifty thousand men to take a city he could starve into submission. If we show him that Constantinople will cost more than it is worth—that is how we buy time. Time for your alliances to form. Time for greed to do its work."

Gennadios nods slowly.

"A holy cause. Time. And greed." He folds his hands. "These are not inspiring words for a sermon. But they are honest."

He looks at the Emperor, then back at Juan.

"You ask what the Orthodox church would look like if it turned every effort to war. I begin to see the shape of it." He counts on his fingers. "First—a proclamation. The Emperor declares the defense of Constantinople sacred duty. Not union with Rome. Not submission. Simply: this is holy work."

A second finger. "Second—the monasteries tithe. Not their lands. Not their independence. But gold. Grain. Medicine. Whatever they can spare. Those who refuse..." He pauses. "We shame them. Publicly. Let the people see who hoards while soldiers die."

A third finger. "Third—processions. Icons. Relics carried through the streets. The Virgin of Blachernae—she has saved this city before. The people must believe this fight is blessed."

He lowers his hand.

"I cannot promise the Patriarch's support. But I can promise this: if the people believe, the Patriarch will follow. He is old. He fears being left behind more than he fears the Latins."

The Emperor has been silent, watching. Now he speaks, his voice quiet.

"We have talked through half the night. Dawn is not far."

He looks around the table—Kantakouzenos, Philanthropenos, Gennadios, Sphrantzes, Lucia, Juan.

"Do we have enough to put before the nobles? Before the people? A proposal—a choice—that they can accept or reject?"

The room waits. Is there enough for a plan? Or does more work remain?

Let us have a good nights sleep. Tomorrow, we meet again at midday and we continue with the nobles. We ask ourself the question, what would it look like it the nobles turn every effort into winning the war. And then the burgers, the guilds, the commoners. And then... I think a plan for victory starts to take shape. 

But let us sleep on it for now. We continue tomorrow.

Orchestrated session closure and structured tomorrow's strategic planning framework



The Emperor nods slowly. The weariness is etched deep in his face, but there is something else there too—something that was not present when the evening began.

"Tomorrow. Midday."

He rises, and the others rise with him.

"Kantakouzenos, Philanthropenos—get what rest you can. I will need you sharp." He glances at Gennadios. "Father, I thank you for coming. For staying when others left."

Gennadios inclines his head. "I stayed because I wished to understand." He looks at Juan. "I am beginning to. That is not the same as agreeing. But it is... something."

Philanthropenos clasps his fist to his chest in a soldier's salute. "Your Majesty. King Juan." His eyes linger on Juan for a moment. "One hundred thousand men. I want to see it. I want to believe it."

He turns and leaves, his boots echoing on the stone floor.

Sphrantzes hovers, uncertain. The Emperor waves him off. "Sleep, old friend. You have earned it."

The room empties. Servants appear to bank the fire, snuff candles, clear the untouched bread and wine.

The Emperor pauses at the door. He looks back at Juan and Lucia.

"It did not go as I hoped tonight. The Patriarch. Notaras." He exhales. "But we are still here. Still planning. That is more than I expected, after..."

He does not finish the sentence.

"Sleep well, King Juan. Queen Lucia." A ghost of a smile. "Tomorrow we ask the nobles to give up their privileges. That should be... entertaining."

He leaves.

The Royal Quarters — Deep Night

The walk back is quiet. The palace corridors are dim, lit by occasional torches. Guards bow as they pass.

Lucia's hand finds Juan's in the darkness.

"You lost two of them," she says quietly. "But you kept three. And found two more."

She squeezes his hand.

"That is not failure, my love. That is a beginning."

Catalina sleeps peacefully in the adjoining chamber. The bed is soft. Constantinople waits outside the windows, ancient and fragile and stubborn.

Synthesized chapter events into cohesive summary document






Chapter 2.22 Complete

The summary document is ready. What a chapter—from the crisis in Naples to the transformation of an Emperor, with disaster and hope intertwined throughout.

Highlights:

Naples: Alfonso's campaign collapsed (Roll: 1). René of Anjou defeated him at Aversa. Juan committed 15,000 Castilian troops to the rescue.
Constantinople: The Emperor's transformation (Roll: 97) was extraordinary—but then the cabinet meeting collapsed (Roll: 6). The Patriarch and Notaras walked out.
The Second Council: Cautious but engaged. Philanthropenos and Gennadios offer a path forward.
The situation is precarious. Juan has won the Emperor's trust but faces powerful opposition within Constantinople. The plan for total mobilization—a Byzantine reconquista—remains half-formed. And Naples awaits his return in July.

The campaign continues in Chapter 2.23, with the nobles, guilds, and commoners still to be addressed. The choice must be shaped and presented. And the Patriarch will not remain silent.
