They are in Basel with the Greeks. I need to read the project files to understand the current situation, particularly the recent chapter summaries and the character database.\n\nLet me start by reading the relevant files to understand what's happening.\n\n\nWelcome back to Chapter 2.4. Let me review the current situation.\n\n\nTool: read_multiple_files\n\n\nThought process: Pivoted to examine available project files instead.\n\nThe Chapter_2_3_Summary.md file doesn't exist. Let me check the project files that are available in the /mnt/project/ directory instead, as those are the ones mentioned in the system prompt.\n\n\nLet me check the project files for the chapter summaries:\n\n\nView: Reading Chapter 2.3 summary to understand current situation with the Greeks at Basel\n\n\nThought process: Reconstructed narrative context from diplomatic meeting aftermath.\n\nExcellent. Now I understand the situation clearly:\n\n- It's May 29, 1433 in Basel\n- Juan just finished a meeting with the Byzantine Metropolitans Bessarion and Isidore\n- He's made significant commitments: 1,000 knights and 60,000 florins to Constantinople immediately\n- The Greeks initially received him with bitter skepticism but warmed to his concrete, honest proposals\n- He's promised to write orders tonight to dispatch the knights\n- He's also promised to write personally to Emperor John VIII\n- The chapter ended with the Metropolitans appreciating his honesty and concrete aid\n\nSo the player says they are \"still in Basel in the presence of the Greeks\" - so we're continuing from the end of Chapter 2.3, likely just after that meeting or still in the same scene. I need to continue the narrative from where it left off.\n\nLet me set the scene for where we are now - the late morning/early afternoon of May 29, 1433, at the end of or just after the Byzantine meeting.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2.4: The Weight of Words\n\n\nBasel, May 29, 1433\n\n\n\nThe study falls into contemplative silence as the magnitude of what has transpired settles over all present. Metropolitan Bessarion remains seated, his scholarly face reflecting careful thought. Beside him, Isidore's gruffer expression has softened—not entirely, for the wounds of Western betrayals run deep—but something has shifted behind those weary eyes.\n\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles stands near the window, the Aragonese ambassador's expression unreadable. He has witnessed much in his years serving King Alfonso, but a Castilian king offering to bleed his kingdom dry for Constantinople's sake—this is something new.\n\n\nThe late morning sun slants through the leaded glass, casting diamond patterns across the maps and papers scattered on the heavy oak table. Outside, Basel continues its daily commerce, oblivious to the decisions being forged in this borrowed merchant's house.\n\n\nBessarion breaks the silence first. His voice carries a different weight now—not the bitter skepticism of an hour ago, but the careful consideration of a man seeing possibility where he expected only disappointment.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty has given us much to carry to our Emperor. Specific numbers. Immediate commitments. Honest assessment of risks and limitations.\" He pauses, fingers steepled before his bearded chin. \"But before we write our letters—and you write yours—there are practical matters we must discuss. Questions the Emperor will ask that we should be prepared to answer.\"\n\n\nIsidore nods, leaning forward with renewed purpose. \"The thousand knights you promise. How quickly can they reach Constantinople? By what route? What supplies will they need? The Ottomans control much of the land between here and there, and our seas are not safe.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say?"

Allocate the war academy officers to this force. They will repair the walls of Constantinopel so masons and architects should also come, along with 60.000 florins from the treasury. This will allow us to repair the walls and man them as well. Have them shipped out as soon as possible.\n\n\nAnother letter for the two Greeks here. A personal letter from me to the emperor, stating that I look forward to seeing him and will visit when my wife has delivered. Explain that I have discussed three opssible options for us to proceed and would like to discuss these with him in person.

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated diplomatic correspondence and deliberated Greek envoys' strategic positioning.\n\nJuan is giving instructions to Fray Hernando to draft two letters:\n1. To Álvaro de Luna - military orders, officers from war academy, masons/architects, 60,000 florins\n2. Personal letter to Emperor John VIII - expressing desire to meet after Isabel's delivery, mentioning the three strategic options discussed, emphasizing aid is given without expectation of reward\n\nThen he asks the Greeks what they will do - return to Constantinople or accompany him on his diplomatic tour of European courts.\n\nThis is a good moment. The Greeks have to make a decision. Let me think about what they would realistically do:\n\n- They've been in Basel for 8 months already\n- They are official representatives of the Emperor\n- They now have HUGE news to report - actual concrete aid coming\n- The Emperor needs to know about this immediately\n- But Juan is offering them the chance to help recruit more aid from other courts\n\nLet me think about their realistic motivations:\n- Bessarion is the scholar-diplomat, more likely to see value in continued advocacy\n- Isidore is gruffer, more political, probably wants to get this news home ASAP\n- They represent the Emperor and can't just wander off with a Castilian king\n- But having Byzantine presence when Juan approaches other courts could be powerful\n\nI think they would have different opinions, or they might compromise - perhaps one stays with Juan, one returns. Or they both feel obligated to report back but appreciate the offer.\n\nLet me have Fray Hernando respond first (he's been called upon), then the Greeks respond to Juan's question.\n\nI need to stop after they respond so Juan can react to their decision.\n\n\nFray Hernando, who has been standing quietly near the door throughout the meeting, steps forward at his King's summons. His Franciscan robes rustle softly as he moves to the writing desk, his weathered face showing the careful attention of a man who has witnessed something significant unfold.\n\n\n\"At once, Your Majesty.\" He draws parchment from the desk, selects a quill, and begins arranging his materials with the methodical precision of long practice. \"I will draft both letters for your review and seal. The instructions to Don Álvaro will be precise—Military Order knights, academy officers, masons, architects, and the treasury allocation. Shall I specify a particular port of departure, or leave that to the Constable's judgment?\"\n\n\nHe does not wait long for answer before turning to the second task, his quill already scratching the first formal salutations in careful Latin script suitable for an Emperor.\n\n\n\nThe two Metropolitans exchange a glance—one of those silent communications between men who have worked together through long months of disappointment. Bessarion's scholarly face shows careful consideration; Isidore's gruffer expression carries something harder to read.\n\n\nIt is Isidore who speaks first, his deep voice carrying the weight of decision.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty does us great honor with such an offer. To have Byzantine voices beside you when you approach other courts...\" He trails off, shaking his head slowly. \"But we cannot. We are the Emperor's representatives, not free agents. What you have committed today—the thousand knights, the sixty thousand florins, the concrete timeline—this news must reach Constantinople with all possible speed. John must know that hope exists. Real hope. Not the empty promises we have heard for years.\"\n\n\nBessarion nods, though his expression suggests he sees the strategic value in what Juan proposes. \"My brother speaks truth. We have been away eight months already. Every week we delay is another week the Emperor waits in uncertainty. Another week Sultan Murad uses to strengthen his position.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, fingers stroking his beard thoughtfully. \"But there is another consideration, Your Majesty. When you approach other courts—France, England, the German princes—you will speak as one who has already committed his own kingdom's resources. You do not ask others to take risks you have not taken yourself. That testimony speaks louder than our presence ever could.\"\n\n\nIsidore leans forward, his weathered hands flat on the table. \"We will carry your letter to John. We will tell him everything—the three options, your honesty about risks, your refusal to demand theological submission. We will tell him that a Latin king wept when we described our children's fear, and then stood and named specific numbers.\" His voice roughens slightly. \"That story, told by us who witnessed it, will mean more than any formal embassy.\"\n\n\nBessarion adds quietly, \"And when you come to Constantinople yourself—after your wife is safely delivered—we will be there to receive you. Not as supplicants greeting a benefactor, but as partners who have already begun the work together.\"\n\n\n\nIsidore's expression hardens slightly with practical concern. \"But Your Majesty asked earlier about routes and timing for your thousand knights. This we must discuss before we part. The journey is not simple, and the Ottomans are not blind to Western movements.\"\n\n\nHe looks to Bessarion, who produces a small, worn map from his robes—clearly something they have carried through their long months of advocacy.\n\n\n\"There are three possible routes,\" Bessarion begins, spreading the map on the table. \"Each with different risks...\"\n\n\n\nHow does Juan respond to their decision? Does he want to discuss the military logistics now, or are there other matters he wishes to address first?"

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed diplomatic motivations and anticipated favorable response.\n\nJuan is asking the Byzantine metropolitans to stay a few more days to witness his address to the Council of Basel. He wants their testimony about Castile's aid commitment to be public knowledge. This is a smart political move - having the Greeks publicly witness and potentially testify about his concrete commitments would lend credibility and pressure other Western powers.\n\nI need to determine how the Greeks respond to this request. Let me think about their motivations:\n- They desperately need to get word back to Constantinople\n- But Juan is right that public testimony would be powerful\n- They've been at Basel 8 months already - a few more days isn't much\n- Having their situation publicly known could help rally support\n- But they also might be wary of being used as props\n\nThis seems like a reasonable request that serves both their interests. I should roll for their response or just determine it logically. Given the context and Juan's reasonable request that clearly serves Constantinople's interests, I think they would agree, though perhaps with some conditions or timeline concerns.\n\nLet me write their response - Bessarion as the more diplomatic one would likely see the wisdom in this, while Isidore might be more impatient but recognize the strategic value.\n\n\nThe two metropolitans exchange another of their silent looks. Isidore's jaw tightens—the impatience of a man who has already spent eight months waiting while his people suffer is visible in every line of his weathered face. But Bessarion's scholarly mind is clearly working through the implications.\n\n\n\"A few days,\" Bessarion says slowly, testing the words. \"Your Majesty intends to address the full Council? The general congregation?\"\n\n\nHis eyes sharpen with sudden interest. This is not a small thing. The Council of Basel, for all its internal divisions, represents the collective voice of Western Christendom. An address by a king who has just completed the Reconquista—and who can announce concrete military commitments to Constantinople—would carry enormous weight.\n\n\nIsidore grunts, but his expression shifts as the strategic value becomes clear. \"Eight months we have begged these Latin prelates for aid. Eight months of theological debates while our walls crumble. And now a king who has actually fought Saracens will stand before them and say he has already committed his kingdom's blood and gold...\"\n\n\nHe trails off, then nods slowly. \"Yes. This we will witness. This we will carry back to John—not just your private promise, but your public declaration before the assembled fathers of the Western Church.\"\n\n\nBessarion adds quietly, \"And if other princes hear that Castile has committed a thousand knights and sixty thousand florins—if they see that one kingdom has already moved from words to deeds—perhaps shame will accomplish what eight months of our pleading could not.\"\n\n\nHe looks directly at Juan, his dark eyes weighing something. \"When do you intend to speak, Your Majesty? We can delay our departure by days, not weeks. Every day matters.\"\n\n\n\nWhat timeline does Juan have in mind for his Council address? And what does he intend to say to the assembled fathers?"

The journey from Basel to Toledo would take considerable time - perhaps 3-4 weeks by horseback through France and over the Pyrenees.\n\nI should have the Greeks depart gracefully, then Fray Hernando provide the practical timeline information. This is a good stopping point to wait for Juan's response about his plans.\n\n\nThe two metropolitans rise, and for the first time since they entered the room, something other than bitter exhaustion shows in their bearing. Bessarion bows with the formal grace of Byzantine court protocol, while Isidore's bow is shorter, more martial—but no less sincere.\n\n\n\"Until we meet again, Your Majesty,\" Bessarion says. \"We will await word of your address. And we will pray—to the same God, whatever our theological disputes—that what has begun in this room today bears fruit.\"\n\n\nIsidore pauses at the door, turning back. His gruff voice carries unexpected weight. \"You asked earlier if we even wanted Western help. We have wanted it for decades. We had simply stopped believing it would come without chains attached.\" He inclines his head. \"Perhaps we were wrong.\"\n\n\nThey depart, their footsteps echoing down the corridor of the merchant's house.\n\n\n\nFray Hernando looks up from the letters he has been drafting, his weathered face thoughtful. He sets down his quill and counts silently on his fingers.\n\n\n\"Today is May twenty-ninth, Your Majesty. You promised Queen Isabel you would return before her delivery, which the physicians expect in late July or early August—let us say the middle of August to be safe, though first children often come early.\"\n\n\nHe moves to the window, gazing out as if measuring distances in his mind. \"The journey from Basel to Toledo... through Burgundy, then France, over the Pyrenees, across Castile. Three weeks at minimum if we ride hard with good weather and fresh horses at each stage. Four weeks if we encounter difficulties—and summer storms in the mountains are not uncommon.\"\n\n\nThe friar turns back to Juan, his expression carrying pastoral concern alongside practical calculation. \"If we wish to arrive in Toledo by mid-July—giving you time with the Queen before the birth—we must depart Basel no later than the third week of June. That gives you perhaps three weeks here, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Emperor Sigismund is crowned in Rome in two days—May thirty-first. He will likely reach Basel sometime in late June, perhaps early July. You may have only narrow window to meet him before you must depart, if any window at all.\"\n\n\n\nWhat are Juan's thoughts on this timeline? Does he wish to wait for Sigismund, or prioritize the return to Isabel?"

Let me do that first.\n\n\nView: Reading NPC guide for realistic NPC behavior guidelines\n\n\nThought process: Scrutinized political feasibility of ambitious diplomatic timeline.\n\nThis is excellent guidance. Now I need to think carefully about Juan's ambitious plan to meet with multiple delegations and address the Council. Let me consider:\n\n1. **Permission to address the Council** - This is not automatic. The Council has its own procedures, factions, and politics. Cardinal Cesarini (papal legate) may or may not have authority to simply grant this, and even if he does, there are political considerations.\n\n2. **Meeting with Hussites** - These are former heretics who fought off five crusades. They are deeply suspicious of Catholic kings. Juan literally just completed a crusade. Why would they trust him?\n\n3. **French delegation** - They push for conciliar supremacy and radical reforms. Juan has a papal decree, papal alliance, papal gifts. He's clearly aligned with Rome. Why would they welcome him?\n\n4. **German delegation** - Fear French domination, caught between factions. More moderate but still cautious.\n\n5. **Italian delegation** - Divided between papal loyalists and reformers. Some might welcome Juan, others might not.\n\nThe key insight from the NPC guide: These are intelligent people pursuing their own goals. They're not going to drop everything to meet with a foreign king just because he asks, especially when:\n- He has clear papal backing (makes conciliarists suspicious)\n- He just completed a crusade (makes Hussites very suspicious)\n- He's an outsider to their eight months of negotiations\n- Each faction has its own agenda that Juan might threaten\n\nLet me think about Fray Hernando's reaction too. He's been at Basel for eight months. He understands the complexity and the procedural nature of this place. He should provide realistic counsel about what's actually possible vs. what Juan wants.\n\nI should not make this easy. Juan is being ambitious - perhaps overconfident from his success with the Byzantines. The Council is a bureaucratic nightmare where single decrees take six months. Getting permission to address them, meeting all these factions in \"a few days\" - this is not realistic.\n\n\nFray Hernando's quill pauses mid-stroke. He looks up from the letters, his weathered face showing the careful expression of a man about to deliver unwelcome news.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" He sets down the quill and rises, his Franciscan robes settling around him. \"I must counsel caution. What you propose—meeting with all these delegations, securing permission to address the full Council, all within days—this is not how Basel functions.\"\n\n\nHe moves to stand before Juan, his voice gentle but firm. \"I have been here eight months, Your Majesty. Eight months watching how this Council operates. A single reform decree on clerical pluralism—something everyone agrees needs reform—took four months from proposal to passage. Four months of deputation meetings, procedural arguments, jurisdictional disputes.\"\n\n\nThe friar begins counting on his fingers. \"To address the general congregation, you must first petition the papal legate—yes, Cardinal Cesarini. But he cannot simply grant permission. The four deputations must agree. Each deputation must vote internally. The French will ask why a king with papal backing should address their Council. The radicals will suspect you've come to undermine their authority.\"\n\n\nHe takes a breath. \"And the Hussites, Your Majesty? You wish to speak with men who have fought off five papal crusades? You have just completed a crusade with papal blessing. You carry relics given by a Pope. Why should they trust you? What assurance do they have that you won't denounce them as heretics the moment you leave their presence?\"\n\n\nFray Hernando's expression softens. \"I do not say these meetings are impossible. But 'a few days'? Your Majesty, securing an audience with the Hussite delegation alone could take a week of negotiations. They are careful men, suspicious of Latin princes. And rightly so.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say to his confessor's concerns?"

This is interesting because Juan has actually listened to Hernando's concerns and adjusted his expectations - he's not insisting on the full Council address anymore, just asking about meeting with the papal legate.\n\nLet me think about Hernando's character:\n- Franciscan friar, deeply pious, morally rigorous\n- Juan's confessor who knows him well\n- Has been at Basel 8 months, understands the situation\n- Willing to challenge Juan when necessary\n- Just gave a frank assessment of the difficulties\n- Now Juan is showing humility by accepting his counsel\n\nThe question is: how does Hernando react to Juan's more measured approach and his request for Hernando to stay by his side?\n\nSuccess factors for Juan:\n- He listened to Hernando's counsel and adjusted expectations\n- He's being flexible (\"step by step\", willing to make declaration outside Council if needed)\n- He's asking for Hernando's guidance and presence\n- He's respecting the confession work timeline\n- He's being pragmatic rather than stubborn\n\nWhat could concern Hernando:\n- Juan still wants to act quickly\n- The mention of \"declaration personally outside the council structure\" - is this wise?\n- Hernando is chief of Castilian delegation - he has duties here\n- If Hernando stays \"by his side\" constantly, who leads the delegation?\n\nActually, I need to reconsider.

Let me check the Chapter 2.3 summary again...\n\nActually in the Chapter 2.3 summary it mentions:\n\"Abbott Rodrigo González (age 73), chief of the Castilian delegation\"\n \nI see a potential resolution to the delegation leadership confusion. Abbott Rodrigo serves as the chief administrator, while Hernando can focus on Juan's spiritual guidance. This allows him flexibility to support Juan closely while maintaining his broader diplomatic responsibilities.\n\nHernando's reaction will likely be nuanced - appreciating Juan's newfound humility and seeking spiritual counsel, while carefully balancing his official duties.

And perhaps—forgive me, Your Majesty—perhaps I fear what I see in your eagerness. You came here speaking of spiritual uncertainty, of dark nights of the soul. Yet within hours you plan meetings with Hussites, French, Germans, Italians, personal declarations...\"\n\n\nThe friar's voice drops lower. \"Is this the measured wisdom of a king seeking God's path? Or is it the impatience of a man who believes his vision must be imposed quickly before doubt can take root?\"\n\n\nHe bows his head slightly. \"I will remain by your side. I will help with your confession work. But I cannot in good conscience help arrange meetings or declarations that may do more harm than good—to this Council, to your mission, and perhaps to your soul.\"\n\n\n\nHow does Juan respond to his confessor's sharp rebuke?"

This shows humility and willingness to learn. Hernando has just delivered a sharp critique, so now he needs to offer constructive alternative.\n\nGiven the roll of 9 (very low - cautious reservation), Hernando should:\n- Remain cautious in his guidance\n- Propose a slow, careful approach\n- Emphasize listening over acting\n- Focus on spiritual foundation first\n- Be skeptical of Juan's eagerness even while offering help\n- Perhaps suggest delegating to the Castilian delegation rather than personal intervention\n\n\nFray Hernando's expression softens slightly at Juan's question. The willingness to listen, to seek counsel—this is what he has prayed for in his King. Yet wariness remains in his eyes.\n\n\nHe moves to the table, pulling out a chair and sitting heavily. After a moment's thought, he speaks.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty asks for guidance. Here is what I propose.\"\n\n\nHe raises one finger. \"First—and this is most important—you must complete your confession work. Three days of prayer, reflection, examination of conscience. Not as obligation to be endured while planning diplomacy, but as genuine spiritual foundation. Every morning at the cathedral. Every evening in reflection. You came here speaking of dark nights and lost paths. Find them first. Everything else flows from that.\"\n\n\nA second finger rises. \"Second, you must understand that you are not the actor here. Your delegation—myself, Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena, the others—we have been here eight months. We have built relationships. We understand the currents. We know who trusts whom, who fears what. If diplomacy is to be conducted, let us conduct it in your name. You are the King of Castile. Kings do not petition for meetings. Kings do not chase down delegations. Your representatives do this.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward, his voice more intense. \"Third, listen before speaking. Attend the general congregation as observer. Sit quietly. Watch the deputations debate. See how the French argue, how the Germans respond, how the Italians maneuver. Learn the rhythm of this place before you try to change its tune. A week of observation would teach you more than a hundred meetings.\"\n\n\nThe friar's expression grows sterner. \"Fourth—and hear me well—abandon this notion of personal declarations. If you have commitments to announce, let your delegation present them formally through proper Council channels. 'King Juan II of Castile has committed one thousand knights to Constantinople's defense.' Let them say it. In proper session. Through proper procedure. This honors the Council's authority while still making your position known.\"\n\n\nHe sits back. \"Finally, regarding Cesarini and the other leaders—if meetings are to happen, let them come to you. You are a king who has completed the Reconquista. You do not need to seek audiences. When word spreads of what you told the Byzantines today—and it will spread—others will seek you out. Let them come. Receive them graciously. Listen to their concerns. Ask questions. Make no promises, no declarations, no grand pronouncements.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando fixes Juan with a steady gaze. \"This is the course of humility, Your Majesty. This is how a wise king conducts diplomacy—through patience, through representatives, through listening. Not through eagerness and personal intervention.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Does this counsel sit well with you? Or does it feel too slow, too cautious for what your heart desires?\"\n\n\n\nHow does Juan respond?"

Fray Hernando should respond to this positively - Juan is learning, even if reluctantly.\n\nHowever, Fray Hernando just rolled a 9/100 - cautious reservation. He's deeply concerned about Juan's state. So while he might be somewhat pleased by Juan's willingness to listen, he's still going to be very careful and measured in his response.\n\nThe question about meeting the papal legate is good - it shows Juan is trying to work within proper channels. But Fray Hernando needs to consider:\n\n1. Cesarini is in fragile state (he saw him weeping)\n2. Juan has been here ONE day\n3. What's the proper channel for a king to meet a papal legate?\n4. What should the PURPOSE of such a meeting be?\n\nHernando should give practical advice but continue to counsel caution.\n\n\nFray Hernando allows himself a small, wry smile at Juan's honest admission. \"Yes, Your Majesty. The Church is indeed a beast—and one that moves at its own pace regardless of the urgency others feel. Many a king has learned this lesson with frustration.\"\n\n\nHis expression grows more thoughtful as he considers the question. \"The papal legate... Cardinal Cesarini. Yes, this meeting would be appropriate. Indeed, it would be expected. You are a king with papal blessing, carrying relics given by Pope Martin himself. That Cesarini should receive you is proper protocol, not presumption.\"\n\n\nHe strokes his chin, thinking. \"The question is not whether to meet, but how to approach it and what purpose the meeting serves.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando rises and begins to pace slowly. \"Here is what I propose. I will go to the Cardinal's residence this afternoon—not as your envoy demanding audience, but as a fellow cleric. I have spoken with him three times these past months. He knows me. He trusts me, insofar as he trusts anyone in his current state.\"\n\n\nHe turns to face Juan. \"I will tell him simply: King Juan II of Castile has arrived in Basel. His Majesty has completed his confession work under my guidance and wishes to pay his respects to the papal legate before departing the city. He seeks no favor, makes no demands. He merely wishes to present himself properly to the Pope's representative, as any faithful Catholic king should.\"\n\n\nThe friar's eyes sharpen. \"And that, Your Majesty, must be what this meeting is. You present yourself. You express respect for his office and the burden he carries. You listen to whatever he wishes to share. You offer no grand plans, no reform proposals, no requests for Council addresses. You simply... meet him. As king to legate. As faithful son of the Church to papal representative.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"If he wishes to speak of weightier matters, let him raise them. If he asks about Constantinople, you may share what you have committed—briefly, humbly. But do not go seeking to reshape the Council through this man's office.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando fixes Juan with that steady gaze again. \"Can you do this, Your Majesty? Can you meet with Cardinal Cesarini simply to pay respects, to listen, to offer no solutions and make no declarations? Can you sit with a man in pain and not try to fix everything?\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say?"

Juan arguing political strategy doesn't threaten this, but Juan ignoring spiritual counsel to push political agenda might.\n\n2. **Sunk Costs**: Hernando has invested 8 months at Basel. He understands its complexity. Juan arriving and immediately proposing solutions could feel dismissive of his experience.\n\n3. **Face/Status**: As confessor, Hernando has spiritual authority over Juan. Juan immediately arguing back after receiving counsel could feel like Juan isn't truly listening.\n\n4. **Professional/Spiritual Duty**: Hernando's primary concern is Juan's soul, not political outcomes. Juan pivoting to political strategy right after Hernando raised concerns about Juan's eagerness could confirm those fears.\n\n**The Papal Decree Question:**\nLet me think about what the decree actually says. From Chapter 2.3 summary, I know Juan has some papal backing, but I should think about what realistic \"endorsement for role in council\" would look like. Pope Eugenius IV is actually trying to dissolve the Council of Basel - he's not pro-council at all. \n\nHernando will likely see Juan's argument as a misinterpretation of papal authority. The decree supports papal power, not Juan's independent intervention. His spiritual concerns center on Juan's impulsive nature and potential for spiritual pride, seeing this as another example of Juan believing he knows better than established institutions.\n\nThe metaphor of the \"trapped beast\" reveals Juan's underlying belief in his own exceptional mission. Hernando will recognize this as a dangerous pattern of messianic thinking that could lead Juan astray from true spiritual humility.\n\nWhile Juan presents his ideas with apparent openness, Hernando will perceive a deeper manipulation. Juan asks for an opinion but truly seeks validation, not genuine guidance. His quick pivot from listening to arguing demonstrates the very spiritual impetuousness Hernando fears most.\n\n\nI have the NPC guide in context. Let me analyze this carefully.\n\n\n\nFRAY HERNANDO'S REACTION TO JUAN'S ARGUMENT\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nJuan is being honest and sharing his reasoning (transparency)\n\nHe's asking for Hernando's opinion (nominally seeking counsel)\n\nThe papal decree does give Juan some role\n\nFraming as \"exploring\" rather than declaring intent\n\nWillingness to discuss privately before acting\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nJuan just received counsel for patience, immediately argues back\n\n\"Trapped beast\" metaphor is patronizing—implies Juan knows better than ancient institution\n\nProposing specific reform mechanism after being told not to make proposals\n\nThis is exactly the pattern Hernando warned about moments ago\n\nCiting external authority (decree) to justify what he already wanted to do\n\n\"What do you think?\" sounds like seeking validation, not guidance\n\nThe very eagerness Hernando just cautioned against\n\n\nHernando's Core Concern:\nAs confessor focused on Juan's soul, he's watching his King receive spiritual counsel about patience and humility, agree to it, then immediately argue why his grand political vision should proceed anyway. This is textbook spiritual danger—using faith language to justify worldly ambition.\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: FRAY HERNANDO'S RESPONSE\n\n\n1-20: Sharp Spiritual Rebuke\nPoints out Juan agreed to patience then immediately argued for his plan; sees this as exactly the spiritual danger he warned about; questions whether Juan truly seeks counsel or merely validation; may refuse to help with papal legate meeting\n\n\n21-40: Firm Challenge\nAcknowledges Juan's honesty but challenges the \"trapped beast\" arrogance; notes Juan cites decree to justify what he wanted anyway; questions whether Juan hears counsel at all; demands reflection before any action\n\n\n41-60: Cautious Engagement\nWilling to discuss political analysis but reiterates spiritual concerns first; examines decree carefully; points out gap between what decree says and what Juan interprets; neither endorses nor condemns, pushes Juan to examine motives\n\n\n61-75: Measured Consideration\nSees merit in some political points while maintaining spiritual caution; discusses decree's actual language vs. Juan's reading; offers conditional support if Juan can demonstrate patience first; tests Juan's willingness to wait\n\n\n76-85: Reluctant Acknowledgment\nAdmits Juan's analysis has some validity; still concerned about eagerness but sees wisdom in exploring options; agrees to discuss with Cardinal but urges extreme caution; wants Juan to listen more than speak\n\n\n86-95: Thoughtful Support\nRecognizes Juan's political insight while maintaining pastoral concern; sees decree as legitimate basis for careful engagement; offers to help navigate but insists on spiritual foundation; balances encouragement with caution\n\n\n96-100: Surprised Approval\nFinds Juan's reasoning more sophisticated than expected; sees potential wisdom in approach if executed with humility; agrees to support exploration while maintaining spiritual oversight; cautiously optimistic\n\n\n\nRoll the d100?"

This is in the 21-40 range.\n\nFray Hernando will acknowledge Juan's honesty but challenge the \"trapped beast\" arrogance. He'll note that Juan cites the decree to justify what he wanted anyway. He'll question whether Juan hears counsel at all and demand reflection before any action.\n\nThis is a critical moment. Juan just received counsel about patience, agreed to it, then immediately pivoted to argue for his plan using the papal decree as justification. Hernando, as a wise spiritual advisor who cares about Juan's soul, will see this pattern clearly.\n\nI need to write Hernando as firm but not cruel, challenging Juan's spiritual state while still caring for him. He needs to point out the contradiction between what Juan says and what Juan does.\n\n\n\nRoll: 23/100 - Firm Challenge\n\n\n\nFray Hernando takes the papal decree from Juan's hands, but he does not look at it immediately. Instead, he sets it on the table and fixes his King with a steady, searching gaze. The silence stretches for several long moments.\n\n\nWhen he speaks, his voice carries the weight of disappointed patience.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty. Not five minutes ago, you said—and I quote your words precisely—'I respect your counsel and will not force the matter.' You acknowledged that your eagerness was perhaps unwise. You asked what I thought was the most appropriate way to proceed.\"\n\n\nHe picks up the decree, glances at it briefly, then sets it down again without reading it closely.\n\n\n\"And now? Now you compare the Church to a wounded beast too stupid to know what is good for it. A beast that must be forced against its instincts by one who knows better—you. You tell me the best course of action for the Pope. You propose specific reform mechanisms. You cite this decree not to ask what it means, but to justify what you already wished to do before I offered any counsel at all.\"\n\n\nThe friar's voice remains calm, but there is iron beneath it. \"Do you hear yourself, Your Majesty? Do you hear the pattern? You ask for counsel, you receive counsel, you agree with counsel—and then you explain why your original plan should proceed anyway, citing whatever authority you can find to support it.\"\n\n\nHe taps the decree. \"This document gives you a role, yes. A role to support the Pope's vision, to advocate for papal authority, to help the Holy Father as his faithful servant. It does not—\" he pauses for emphasis, \"—appoint you architect of a new constitutional order for the Church. It does not ask you to design systems where councils cannot be vetoed. It does not invite you to treat centuries of theological dispute as a simple problem requiring your solution.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando leans forward, his dark eyes intense. \"The trapped beast that 'cannot free itself'—Your Majesty, the men of this Council are not beasts. They are bishops, cardinals, scholars who have spent their entire lives studying these questions. Cardinal Cesarini has forgotten more about canon law than you or I will ever know. And you, after one day in Basel, believe you see what they cannot? That you must act 'against their instincts' because you know better?\"\n\n\nHe straightens, his voice softening slightly but losing none of its firmness. \"This is pride, Your Majesty. Dangerous pride. The same pride that makes a man believe his vision is God's vision, that his certainty is divine guidance. You came to Basel speaking of spiritual crisis, of fearing you had lost God's path. And now you propose to reshape the Church's constitution because you have identified the 'best course of action.'\"\n\n\nThe friar falls silent for a moment, then speaks with profound care. \"I will not help you arrange meetings or present proposals until you have spent real time in prayer and reflection—not as formality, but as genuine examination. Ask yourself: Am I seeking to serve God, or am I seeking to be the one who solved the Church's crisis? Am I listening to counsel, or am I collecting permissions for what I already wish to do?\"\n\n\nHe gestures to the decree. \"Read it again. Read what it actually says, not what you wish it to say. Then pray on it. Come to me tomorrow morning after you have spent the evening in genuine reflection, and we will discuss what the Pope's words truly ask of you.\"\n\n\nHis expression carries both challenge and care. \"Can you do this, Your Majesty? Can you wait one day—truly wait, without planning and scheming—before proceeding?\"\n\n\n\nHow does Juan respond to this rebuke?"

Juan is pushing back against Hernando's rebuke, but doing so in a way that's both honest and attempting to show vulnerability. He's asking Hernando to accept his honesty even when it reveals problematic thinking, rather than forcing him to hide his thoughts.\n\nThis is actually a sophisticated argument - Juan is essentially saying \"I'd rather be honest with you about my flawed thinking so you can help me examine it, than pretend to agree and then do what I want anyway.\"\n\nHowever, Fray Hernando just gave a firm challenge (roll 23). He's concerned about Juan's spiritual state. How would he respond to this?\n\nKey considerations:\n- Juan is being genuine about wanting to be honest\n- But he's also still justifying his position subtly\n- \"I know my own vision is not God's vision\" immediately followed by \"But I do feel a responsibility to help the council in the way I feel it should be helped\" - this is exactly the pattern Hernando warned about\n- \"I do not always agree with it\" - this is honest, but also shows Juan is still not fully receptive\n- He's committing to reflection but with caveats (\"I cannot stop thinking\")\n- The gesture of taking Hernando's hand is genuine\n\nHernando is a wise confessor. He would:\n1. Appreciate the honesty\n2. But also see that Juan is still partially deflecting\n3. Recognize the progress but not be fully satisfied\n4. Accept the commitment to reflection but with continued concern\n\nI should write Hernando's response as measured - acknowledging the positive while still maintaining his pastoral concern. He's not going to suddenly be satisfied just because Juan is being honest about his flaws. That's a start, but not the end.\n\n\nFray Hernando looks down at Juan's hand clasping his own. For a long moment, the friar is silent, his weathered face unreadable. Then he lets out a slow breath—not quite a sigh, but something close to it.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of honesty, and I do value this. Truly.\" His voice is quieter now, the iron softened though not gone entirely. \"You are right that many kings would simply tell their confessors what they wish to hear, then proceed as they please. That you do not—that you bare your thoughts even when you know I will challenge them—this is to your credit.\"\n\n\nHe does not withdraw his hand, but his grip firms slightly as he meets Juan's eyes.\n\n\n\"But hear what you have just said, Your Majesty. In one breath: 'I know my own vision is not God's vision.' In the next: 'I feel a responsibility to help the council in the way I feel it should be helped.' Do you see? You speak the words of humility, then immediately assert your own judgment. You acknowledge you may be wrong, then proceed as though you are right.\"\n\n\nThe friar gently releases Juan's hand and steps back. \"And this—'I do not always agree with your counsel, but I reflect on it'—Your Majesty, a confessor's role is not to offer suggestions you may agree or disagree with as it pleases you. When I speak to your soul's health, I speak as one who sees dangers you may not. A physician does not offer his patient options. He prescribes what will heal.\"\n\n\nHe moves toward the door, then pauses. \"But yes. Spend this day in reflection. Pray. Examine not your plans for the Council, but your heart. Ask yourself why you must help, why you must act, why patience feels so unbearable. These are the questions that matter.\"\n\n\nHis expression softens just slightly. \"I will return this evening. We will speak. And Your Majesty—\" he pauses, \"—thank you for your honesty. It is indeed better than falsehood. But honesty about one's flaws is only the first step.

Short conversation with merchant, craftsman, or minor cleric; practical perspective on Council's effects on daily life; simple wisdom without knowing who Juan is.\n\nI need to create an authentic encounter that provides Juan with some perspective without being too convenient or heavy-handed. This should be a genuine interaction that might give him something to reflect on.\n\n\n\nRoll: 62/100 - Brief Meaningful Exchange\n\n\n\nJuan steps out into Basel's afternoon streets, leaving behind the merchant's house and its weight of decisions. The late May sun hangs warm over the city, casting long shadows between the tall timber-framed buildings. The air smells of river water, horse dung, and fresh bread from nearby bakeries.\n\n\nHe walks without particular direction, letting his feet carry him through the winding streets. Basel teems with life—merchants hawking wares, clerics in various habits hurrying past, servants carrying baskets, children darting between legs. Everywhere he hears Latin mixing with German, French, Italian. The Council has swollen this trading city to bursting.\n\n\nNo one pays particular attention to the Spanish noble in his fine but understated clothing. Foreign dignitaries are common as rats here.\n\n\n\nAfter perhaps an hour of wandering, Juan finds himself in a small square near the cathedral. A stone fountain burbles at its center, and several people have gathered to rest in the shade of a large linden tree. Juan's feet ache slightly—he is more accustomed to riding than walking cobblestones.\n\n\nHe settles on the fountain's edge, letting the sound of water soothe his thoughts. Nearby, an older man sits on a wooden bench, carefully stitching a leather saddle. His hands move with the practiced ease of decades, the needle flashing rhythmically. He wears the simple clothes of a craftsman—a leather apron over brown wool, sleeves rolled to show forearms scarred from years of work.\n\n\nThe man glances up, notes Juan's presence with mild interest, then returns to his work. After a moment, he speaks in accented Latin—the common tongue of educated Europe.\n\n\n\"Spanish, yes? From your clothes.\" It's not really a question. \"Here for the Council, I suppose. Everyone is here for the Council.\"\n\n\nHe does not stop his stitching as he talks, the rhythm unbroken.\n\n\n\"Eight months they debate in there.\" A jerk of his head toward the cathedral visible above the rooftops. \"Eight months. You know how many saddles I have made in eight months? Forty-three. Forty-three saddles, each one different, each one fitted to its rider and horse. And these learned men? Not one decision that sticks. Not one.\"\n\n\nHe pulls the thread tight, examines his work, nods to himself.\n\n\n\"My customers, they come to me with problem. Saddle does not fit, horse gets sores, rider gets sores. You know what I do? I fix it. I do not debate for eight months whether saddle should fit. I make it fit. Because the horse, he does not care about my theories. He cares that his back hurts.\"\n\n\nThe saddler looks up at Juan, squinting slightly. \"You are here for the Council business, yes? You have that look. The look of a man carrying heavy thoughts.\"\n\n\n\nHow does Juan respond to the saddler?"

The saddler doesn't know he's talking to a king, just sees a Spanish noble. He'll respond based on his craftsman's common sense perspective.\n\nThis is a brief meaningful exchange, so it should be relatively short but offer some practical wisdom that might give Juan a new perspective. The saddler should respond naturally to what sounds like a nobleman wrestling with whether to interfere in church business.\n\n\nThe saddler pauses his stitching and looks up at Juan properly for the first time. His weathered face creases with something between amusement and consideration.\n\n\n\"Presumptuous? Arrogant?\" He chuckles, a dry sound. \"My friend, you ask the wrong question.\"\n\n\nHe sets down his needle and holds up the saddle he's been working on. \"See this? A lord's saddle. Fine leather, good work. The lord who ordered it—he came to me and said, 'Saddler, my horse's back is rubbed raw. Fix it.' Did I say to him, 'My lord, is it not presumptuous of me to fix your saddle? Perhaps your saddle knows better than I do?' No. He has a problem. I have skill. I fix.\"\n\n\nHe turns the saddle, examining it. \"But here is the thing. When he came, did I say, 'My lord, your saddle is wrong, you must let me remake it completely'? No. I asked questions. Where does horse hurt? Where does leather rub? How do you sit? I listened. Then I made small changes—pad here, loosen there, adjust this strap. Not because I am greatest saddler in world. Because I paid attention to the problem.\"\n\n\nThe old man picks up his needle again, resuming his work. \"You want to fix their saddle? Good. But you don't walk into a man's house and say, 'Your house is built wrong, let me rebuild it.' You say, 'I notice your roof leaks. I know something of roofs. May I look?' You offer. You ask. If they say no, you have done your duty by offering. If they say yes, you look carefully before you touch anything.\"\n\n\nHe pulls the thread tight. \"The arrogance is not in wanting to help. The arrogance is in thinking you must help whether they want it or not. In thinking that if they refuse your help, they are fools and you must force them to accept.\"\n\n\nHe glances up at Juan. \"This Council problem of yours—have they asked for your help? Or do you wish to give it because you see what they do not?\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say?"

The saddler has given him simple but profound wisdom.

He sets down his work entirely now, giving Juan his full attention.\n\n\n\"Ha! At least you are honest man. This is something.\" He shakes his head, still chuckling. \"Most men who want to fix everyone's saddle, they do not admit it. They say, 'No, no, I only want to help. They need my help. They just do not see it yet.' You? You say, 'Yes, I am that man.' This is good. This is beginning of wisdom.\"\n\n\nHe leans back on his bench, studying Juan with shrewd eyes. \"But let me tell you something, my Spanish friend. I have been making saddles forty years. Forty years. And you know what I have learned? The best saddlers—the ones people come to from miles away—they are not the ones with cleverest ideas. They are the ones who listen best.\"\n\n\nHe holds up a gnarled finger. \"When young apprentice comes to me, first thing he wants to do is show me his ideas. 'Master, I have thought of new way to stitch!' 'Master, what if we put buckle here instead?' Always the ideas. I tell him: sit. Watch. Listen. Make the simple saddles first. Learn why things are done the way they are done. Then maybe—maybe—you earn the right to suggest changes.\"\n\n\nThe saddler picks up his work again, but continues talking. \"Those men in the Council? They have been making saddles long time. Longer than you, I think. Maybe their saddle does not fit so well. Maybe it needs fixing. But if you walk in and say, 'I see your problem, here is my solution'—what do they hear? They hear young apprentice who thinks he knows better than master craftsman.\"\n\n\nHe pulls a stitch tight. \"But if you walk in and say, 'I am new to saddle-making. I have made one saddle, it fit well. Now I wish to learn from you who have made many saddles'—ah, then they listen. Then maybe, maybe, when you have sat and watched and learned, they ask you: 'What do you think of this problem?' And then you speak.\"\n\n\nHe looks up again. \"Your saddle that fit well—what was it? What did you fix that makes you want to fix more?\"\n\n\n\nDoes Juan tell him about Granada?"

The saddler is a practical craftsman who speaks plainly. He won't be impressed by credentials or written testimonies - he judges by what he sees in front of him.\n\nThis is a brief meaningful exchange, not a profound life-changing conversation. The saddler will give honest, earthy wisdom but he's not going to be overly philosophical. He's a craftsman, he speaks from experience.\n\nThe key thing is - Juan is still doing the same pattern Fray Hernando called out. He receives counsel, then argues why his situation is special. The saddler might see through this.\n\n\nThe saddler stops his stitching and fixes Juan with a long, steady look. There's no deference in that gaze—just the frank assessment of a man who has lived long enough to see through posturing.\n\n\n\"Written testimony,\" he repeats slowly. \"Another master says you are good.\" He makes a sound somewhere between a grunt and a laugh. \"My friend, I have seen many written testimonies in my time. Lords come to me with letters saying their previous saddler was master of his craft. Then I see the saddle he made, and the horse's back is bleeding.\"\n\n\nHe resumes his work, needle flashing. \"You ask if I would see your ability or see young apprentice? I tell you what I would see. I would see man who talks about his written testimony instead of showing me his work. I would see man who asks, 'Would you respect my credentials?' instead of asking, 'May I watch how you work?'\"\n\n\nThe saddler shrugs. \"Maybe you are experienced. Maybe you have made good saddles. I do not know—I have not seen them. But I tell you this: true master does not need to argue he is master. He shows his work. He lets work speak.\"\n\n\nHe pulls the thread tight, examining his stitching. \"And here is other thing. Even if you are greatest saddler in world—if you go to another man's workshop and say, 'Your way is wrong, my written testimony proves I know better'—what happens? He throws you out. Not because you are wrong. Maybe you are right. But because you have insulted him in his own workshop.\"\n\n\nThe old man looks up again. \"You want advice? Real advice? Stop thinking about whether they will see your ability. Start thinking about whether you see theirs. Go to their workshop. Watch. Learn. Maybe you discover they know things you do not. Maybe you discover your written testimony means less than you thought.\"\n\n\nHe returns to his saddle. \"Or maybe, after watching, you still think they are fools and you know better. Then you have choice: force your help on fools who do not want it, or walk away and make your own saddles in your own workshop. Both are honest choices. But arguing that they should respect your credentials while you do not respect their experience? That is no choice at all. That is just pride wearing humble clothes.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say?"

The saddler has done his job well - provided simple, earthy wisdom that cuts through Juan's grand plans and schemes.\n\nI should let this moment breathe. The saddler might respond, or might simply continue his work. The scene should reflect the contemplative nature of what Juan is experiencing.\n\nGiven that Juan is staring silently at the cathedral, I should describe what he sees and feels, and perhaps the saddler's reaction to this silence. This is a moment of potential spiritual growth - exactly what Fray Hernando wanted Juan to find through reflection.\n\nThe saddler is a simple craftsman. He's said his piece. He might continue working, offer one last bit of wisdom, or simply leave Juan to his thoughts. I think he would respect the silence - he's not a man of many unnecessary words.\n\n\nThe saddler says nothing. He returns to his stitching, the rhythmic pull of needle through leather the only sound between them. He is a man comfortable with silence, with letting thoughts settle like sediment in still water.\n\n\nThe cathedral rises above Basel's rooftops, its red sandstone towers catching the afternoon light. Eight months, the saddler said. Eight months of debates within those walls. Hundreds of the finest minds in Christendom, each convinced they know how to save the Church.\n\n\nAnd Juan has been in Basel for one day.\n\n\nThe fountain burbles behind him. Somewhere a child laughs. The smell of baking bread drifts from a nearby street. Life continues in Basel regardless of what the Council decides, regardless of what Juan of Castile wishes to accomplish.\n\n\nLetting go.\n\n\nFray Hernando spoke of humility, of patience. Juan heard the words but immediately sought to argue why his plans should proceed anyway. The saddler speaks of the same thing in simpler terms: stop trying to fix what does not ask to be fixed.\n\n\nThe silence stretches. Finally, the old craftsman speaks without looking up from his work.\n\n\n\"Letting go. Yes. Very hard thing.\" His needle flashes. \"Hardest thing, maybe, for a man who sees problems and knows he can fix them. To stand back and say, 'This is not mine to fix.' To trust that maybe the problem works itself out. Or maybe it does not, and that is sad, but still not yours.\"\n\n\nHe ties off a stitch, cuts the thread with a small knife. \"But here is the secret, my friend. Sometimes when you let go—when you stop forcing—things come to you. You make your own good saddles in your own workshop, people hear about it. They come to you. They say, 'I have heard of your work. Will you look at my saddle?' And then—then—you can help. Because they asked.\"\n\n\nHe begins threading his needle again. \"Go look at your cathedral. Think your thoughts. But remember: the world does not end because you do not fix it today.\"\n\n\n\nDoes Juan remain with the saddler, or does he continue his contemplation elsewhere?"

Across from the fountain, a woman tends a modest stall—fresh bread arranged in baskets, some rounds of pale cheese wrapped in cloth, a few clay jugs that likely hold ale or cider. She calls out occasionally to passersby in German, her voice competing with the fountain's burble.\n\n\nNearby, a boy sits with a small cart, selling apples from the surrounding orchards.

More than enough for bread and whatever else the woman sells.\n\n\nThe saddler continues his work, paying no attention to Juan's surveying of the square.

The cathedral would be a busy place - possibly with Council sessions, debates, or at least clerics and delegates moving about. Let me think about what would realistically be happening:\n\n- Late afternoon, so formal sessions might be winding down or there might be deputation meetings\n- The Council uses the cathedral for general congregations\n- Four deputations: Prelates, Doctors, Canons, Lower Clergy\n- Lots of clerics from different nations\n- Tension between factions\n- The Hussite delegation arrived about two weeks ago\n\nI should describe:\n1.

The red sandstone edifice looms above him, its twin towers reaching toward heaven. He has seen many cathedrals—Toledo, Burgos, even Rome's great churches—but there is something different about this one. It feels less like a house of worship and more like a fortress under siege.\n\n\nHe pushes through the heavy doors and steps inside.\n\n\n\nThe nave stretches before him, vast and shadowed despite the afternoon light filtering through high windows. But this is not the quiet sanctuary he expected. The cathedral has been transformed into something else entirely—a parliament chamber, a debating hall, a battlefield of words.\n\n\nWooden benches have been arranged in rows facing a raised platform at the crossing. Hundreds of men in ecclesiastical robes fill these benches—black Benedictine habits, brown Franciscan robes, white Dominican cloaks, the purple of bishops, the red of cardinals. The air is thick with the smell of incense, candle wax, old stone, and too many bodies in an enclosed space.\n\n\nA session is in progress.\n\n\nOn the raised platform, a figure in cardinal's red stands speaking. His Latin echoes off the stone walls, formal and precise. Juan recognizes the voice before he sees the face clearly—Cardinal Cesarini, the papal legate. The same man who wept alone in the chapel this morning.\n\n\n\"...and therefore the deputation of Doctors proposes that the matter of clerical concubinage be remanded to committee for further study of canonical precedents before any decree is issued...\"\n\n\nA murmur ripples through the assembly. Someone calls out in French-accented Latin: \"Further study? We have studied this matter for three months already! The faithful cry out for reform while we debate precedents!\"\n\n\nAnother voice, German: \"Procedure must be followed. Without proper canonical foundation, any decree will be challenged.\"\n\n\nItalian: \"The Holy Father himself has spoken on this matter. Why do we not simply implement his guidance?\"\n\n\nThe French voice again, sharper: \"Because this Council does not take orders from Rome! We are not the Pope's servants—we are Christ's!\"\n\n\nCesarini raises his hands, calling for order. His voice carries the weariness Juan heard this morning. \"Brothers, please. We must maintain decorum. The question before us is procedural, not theological...\"\n\n\n\nJuan finds a place in the shadows near the back, leaning against a stone pillar where he can observe without being noticed. He watches.\n\n\nThe debate continues. It is, he realizes, exactly what Abbot Rodrigo described. Faction against faction. French radicals pushing for conciliar supremacy. German moderates seeking compromise. Italian loyalists defending papal prerogative. And threading through it all, the weary figure of Cesarini trying to hold the center together.\n\n\nA simple matter—clerical concubinage, something all agree needs reform—becomes tangled in jurisdictional disputes. Does the Council have authority to decree this? Must the Pope approve? Is this Council's decree automatically binding, or does it require papal confirmation? Every question of substance becomes a question of authority.\n\n\nAnd beneath it all, Juan senses the deeper current: fear. Fear of schism. Fear of irrelevance. Fear that if they get this wrong, the Church itself will shatter.\n\n\nHe watches for nearly an hour. In that time, no decision is reached. The matter is indeed remanded to committee. Another matter is raised—something about benefices—and the same dance begins again.\n\n\n\nAs the afternoon wanes, the session begins to break up. Small clusters of clerics form, continuing debates in lower voices. Juan remains in his shadowed corner, watching.\n\n\nNear him, two men in bishop's purple pass by, speaking in low but heated Italian.\n\n\n\"Cesarini cannot hold this together much longer. Did you see his face? The man is exhausted.\"\n\n\n\"Exhausted or not, he is our only hope. If Aleman's faction gains control...\"\n\n\n\"Then we have a Council that deposes Eugenius and elects their own Pope. And we have schism again.\"\n\n\n\"Perhaps schism is better than this paralysis.\"\n\n\n\"You do not mean that.\"\n\n\nA pause. \"No. No, I do not. But something must break, one way or another.\"\n\n\nThey move away, their voices fading.\n\n\n\nThe cathedral slowly empties as delegates depart for evening meals and private meetings. The great space grows quieter, though never entirely silent—clerics still kneel in various chapels, their prayers murmuring like distant water.\n\n\nJuan remains, watching the last light filter through the windows, casting colored shadows across the stone floor.\n\n\n\nWhat are Juan's thoughts as he observes all this? Does he remain, or does he return to prepare for his evening meeting with Fray Hernando?"

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated spiritual reckoning and pivotal confessor encounter.\n\nJuan has had a meaningful afternoon of reflection. He's reached an important spiritual insight - that his desire to \"fix\" the Council may itself be the problem, not the solution. The saddler's wisdom has resonated with him, and watching the Council in action has confirmed the paralysis.\n\nNow he returns for his evening meeting with Fray Hernando. This is a pivotal moment - will Juan's reflection be genuine, or will he immediately pivot back to scheming? Hernando will be watching carefully.\n\nI should set the scene for their evening meeting and see how Juan presents his reflections to his confessor. This is about Juan's spiritual state, not his political plans. Hernando will be assessing whether Juan has truly internalized anything from the day.\n\n\n\nThe chapel Juan finds is small and empty—a side altar dedicated to Saint Barbara, tucked away from the main nave. A single candle flickers before the saint's image, casting dancing shadows on the stone walls. The noise of the departing Council delegates fades to nothing here.\n\n\nHe kneels on the cold stone. No cushion. The discomfort feels right somehow.\n\n\nWhat if I am wrong?\n\n\nThe question he brought to Basel, the weight on his soul. But he has been asking it about the wrong things. He thought he was asking: What if my reforms are wrong? What if my plans fail?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nThe deeper question: What if my certainty that I must act is itself the wrong?\n\n\nThe saddler's words echo: The arrogance is not in wanting to help. The arrogance is in thinking you must help whether they want it or not.\n\n\nAnd: Letting go. Very hard thing.\n\n\nJuan's hands clasp tighter on the prayer rail. He has completed the Reconquista. He has returned relics to Rome. He has committed a thousand knights to Constantinople. And still—still—he arrives in Basel for one day and believes he must reshape the Church's constitution.\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nBecause he cannot bear the thought of it tearing itself apart while he watches. Because he sees the problem clearly and cannot accept that he might not be the solution. Because letting go feels like failure, like abandoning his duty, like cowardice.\n\n\nBut what if letting go is the hardest courage of all?\n\n\nThe candle flickers. Saint Barbara gazes down with painted serenity. She who was martyred by her own father rather than renounce her faith. She did not try to fix the world. She simply held to what was true and let God handle the rest.\n\n\nMake your own saddles well first. Everything else comes from that.\n\n\nJuan prays. Not the formal prayers of a king, not the grand petitions of a crusader. Simple, anguished words offered into the darkness of a side chapel.\n\n\nLord, I do not know if I am meant to save Your Church or simply to serve it. I do not know if my visions are Your guidance or my pride. Grant me wisdom to know which battles are mine to fight, and grace to release the ones that are not.\n\n\nHelp me let go.\n\n\n\nEVENING - THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE\n\n\nThe sun has set by the time Juan returns to his quarters. The simple meal sits on the table—bread, cheese, cold meat, a cup of wine. Plain fare. He eats slowly, tasting little, his mind still in that small chapel.\n\n\nWhen Fray Hernando enters, the friar's sharp eyes immediately take in Juan's demeanor. Something has changed since this afternoon. The eager energy, the impatience to act—they are muted. In their place sits something quieter. Perhaps genuine reflection. Perhaps exhaustion. Perhaps both.\n\n\nHernando settles into a chair across from Juan, his Franciscan robes rustling. He does not speak immediately, waiting instead to let the King set the tone. His weathered face shows caution, but also something like hope—the hope of a confessor who has prayed for his charge's soul and wonders if those prayers might be answered.\n\n\nThe candles flicker between them. Outside, Basel settles into evening quiet.\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say to his confessor?"

He notes the pattern of Juan agreeing then reverting, and asks pointed questions about what changed. He reserves judgment.\n\nThis is a realistic response from a confessor who has been through this pattern before with Juan. Just this morning Juan agreed to patience, then immediately argued for his plans. Hernando has seen Juan's spiritual language used to justify worldly ambition before. One afternoon of reflection producing such a complete turnaround would naturally make a wise confessor suspicious.\n\n\n\nRoll: 24/100 - Cautious Doubt\n\n\n\nFray Hernando listens in silence as Juan speaks. His weathered hands rest on his knees, his dark eyes fixed on the King's face. The candlelight catches the deep lines around his mouth, the furrows in his brow. When Juan finishes, the friar does not immediately respond.\n\n\nThe silence stretches.\n\n\nThen, slowly, Hernando rises from his chair. He moves to the window, his back to Juan, looking out at Basel's darkened streets. When he speaks, his voice is quiet but carries an edge of something—not anger, but something harder to bear. Weariness, perhaps. Or the caution of a man who has been disappointed before.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks beautiful words.\" He does not turn around. \"Humble words. Words of repentance and self-knowledge. Words any confessor would be glad to hear.\"\n\n\nAnother silence.\n\n\n\"This morning, you spoke humble words also. You said you respected my counsel. You said you would not force the matter. You said you would complete your confession work.\" Finally, he turns, and his eyes are searching, probing. \"And then, within moments—moments, Your Majesty—you were arguing for why your plans should proceed. You showed me the papal decree. You explained why you must reform the Church. You had the language of humility, but the actions of a man who had already decided.\"\n\n\nHe returns to his chair but does not sit. He stands behind it, hands gripping the back. \"Now you come to me with a confession of arrogance, of letting go, of understanding that it is not your place to change the Church. You speak of being God's humble servant. And I want to believe you, Your Majesty. I have prayed for this moment. I have begged God to open your eyes to the spiritual dangers I see.\"\n\n\nHis knuckles whiten on the chair. \"But I must ask: what has changed? This afternoon you were determined. Now you are contrite. This morning you agreed with my counsel, then immediately argued against it. How do I know this is not the same pattern? How do I know that tomorrow morning, when some messenger arrives or some opportunity presents itself, you will not again find reasons why your vision must proceed?\"\n\n\nFray Hernando's voice softens, but loses none of its intensity. \"You speak of letting go, of accepting that the Church may tear itself apart. These are profound realizations. But Your Majesty, I have been your confessor long enough to know that profound realizations in the evening can become forgotten wisdom by morning. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.\"\n\n\nHe finally sits, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees. \"Tell me plainly, Your Majesty. What happened this afternoon that brought you to this place? Not the words you think I want to hear. Not the theological language of humility. Tell me the truth of it. What did you see or hear or feel that changed you? And more importantly—how will you remain changed when the morning comes and the world presses its demands upon you again?\"\n\n\nHis dark eyes hold Juan's gaze without flinching. \"I will help you, Your Majesty. I swore before God to guide your soul. But I cannot offer absolution for words alone. Show me the substance behind them.\"\n\n\n\nHow does Juan respond to this challenge?"

I commented that I would like very much to \"fix their saddle as well\", and we continued this comparison. He made the distinction that he would never walk into a noble man's home and comment that his saddle is wrong and that he must fix it. A comment that struck home very clearly. It is not my task to change the church, and even if I did have exactlly the right reform, no one would listen or even accept it. I must let go.

Juan is showing vulnerability and honesty. But Hernando rolled a 24/100 - Cautious Doubt. So even with this honest answer, Hernando remains wary.

A Franciscan would approve—we believe the humble often see truths the learned miss.\"\n\n\nHe shifts in his chair, his posture relaxing slightly but not entirely. \"I appreciate your honesty, Your Majesty. And I note that you do not claim grand revelation or divine vision. You speak of a conversation with a craftsman, a simple analogy that struck home. This... this sounds true to me. More true than theological language would.\"\n\n\nThe friar rises and moves to pour himself water from a clay pitcher on the side table. He does not offer any to Juan—a small thing, but notable. He is not yet ready for the casual fellowship of shared drink.\n\n\n\"You say this is a constant struggle. Yes. This is wisdom. You say insights do not guard you forever. Also wisdom. You admit you do not know what to do next. More wisdom still.\" He drinks, sets down the cup. \"All of this is good, Your Majesty. All of this suggests genuine reflection occurred today.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to face Juan, and his expression carries the weight of a man who must deliver hard truth.\n\n\n\"But I must speak plainly. You have had insights before. After the Infantes' rebellion, you spoke of humility. After Father Tomás refused you absolution, you wrestled with your soul. Each time, genuine struggle. Each time, real growth. And each time...\" He pauses. \"Each time, Your Majesty, the world presented new opportunities, and the old patterns returned. Not because you are evil or insincere. But because, as you say, the flesh is weak.\"\n\n\nHe returns to his chair. \"So here is what I propose. Not absolution tonight. Not yet. Tomorrow you will complete your second day of reflection. And I will give you a task—not to contemplate grand theological questions, but something simple. Concrete.\"\n\n\nHis eyes meet Juan's steadily. \"Tomorrow, you will attend the Council session as observer only. You will sit in the back, as you did today. You will watch. You will listen. And when your mind begins to say 'I could fix this' or 'If only they would hear my proposal'—and it will say these things, Your Majesty—you will note it. You will write it down. Every time. Every impulse to act, to speak, to fix. You will bring me this list tomorrow evening.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"This is how we test whether the insight of the afternoon can survive the morning. Not by your words tonight, but by your actions tomorrow. Can you watch the Church struggle and not intervene? Can you let go in practice, not merely in principle?\"\n\n\nHis voice softens slightly. \"This is not punishment, Your Majesty. This is medicine. The soul, like the body, heals through discipline and practice, not through single moments of understanding. You say you want to let go. Show me. Show yourself. Show God.\"\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\"Will you accept this task?\"\n\n\n\nHow does Juan respond?"

After the Infantes' rebellion - Juan showed humility but then proceeded with his grand plans\n2. After Father Tomás refused absolution (this was about messianic thinking) - Juan wrestled with it but continued his ambitious trajectory\n3. The pattern throughout: Juan has genuine spiritual struggles, receives counsel, agrees with it, then finds reasons why his vision should proceed anyway\n\nHernando would have specific examples:\n- The papal audience where Juan stripped naked - genuine humility, but then immediately began planning how to use the papal blessing for his goals\n- The Granada campaign - justified as divine mission\n- Coming to Basel - after all the warnings about messianic thinking, Juan arrives and within ONE DAY is planning to address the Council, meet all factions, reform Church structure\n- This very morning - agreed to patience, then immediately argued for his plans with the papal decree\n\nHernando is a confessor who knows Juan's soul. He would have specific, concrete examples. The NPC guide says to make NPCs realistic and intelligent. Hernando wouldn't be vague - he'd be painfully specific because that's his job as confessor.\n\nThis needs to be a moment of honest reckoning.

This is what a man serious about his soul does. He does not hide from his patterns. He examines them.\"\n\n\nThe friar settles deeper into his chair, his weathered face thoughtful. When he speaks, his voice carries the careful precision of a man who has watched and remembered.\n\n\n\"Let us begin with Rome, Your Majesty. Two and a half years ago now. You stood before Pope Martin, stripped naked, offering everything. Genuine humility. I witnessed it. I wept. The Holy Father wept. The cardinals wept. A king, truly renouncing his glory.\" He pauses. \"And then? Within weeks—weeks—you were in Barcelona organizing your crusade, speaking of divine mission, of God's chosen instrument. The humility of Rome became the certainty of divine purpose.\"\n\n\nHe raises a finger. \"The Infantes' rebellion. When they surrendered, you spoke of mercy, of learning from the experience, of the dangers of royal pride. Beautiful reflections. And then you proceeded with your plans exactly as before, as if their rebellion was merely an obstacle overcome, not a warning about the dangers of your ambitions.\"\n\n\nAnother finger rises. \"Father Tomás in Toledo. He refused you absolution. You remember this, yes? He saw the seeds of messianic thinking—a king who believes his vision is God's vision. You were shaken. You wrestled. You spoke to me of your fears. And yet, Your Majesty, what followed? The Granada campaign proceeded. The conquest was completed. And you arrived in Rome declaring yourself instrument of divine will, returning relics, speaking of eternal crusades.\"\n\n\nHernando's voice remains steady, without accusation, but the weight of truth is heavy. \"And this very morning, Your Majesty. This very morning I counseled patience. You agreed. You said you would not force the matter. You asked about meeting the papal legate appropriately. And before I could even finish my thoughts, you were showing me the papal decree, explaining why you must propose reform mechanisms, why the Pope should sign laws to avoid schism, why your vision for the Church's structure must be heard.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"Do you see the pattern? Each time, genuine spiritual insight. Each time, real wrestling with your soul. And each time, the world offers opportunity—papal blessing, military victory, conquered Granada, Council of Basel—and the insight is forgotten. Not abandoned consciously. Forgotten. Because the opportunity feels so right, so aligned with what God must surely want.\"\n\n\nThe friar's dark eyes hold Juan's gaze. \"Your Majesty asked me once, 'What if I am wrong?' The pattern is this: you ask the question, you receive answer, and then you proceed as if the answer confirmed what you already believed. You take the struggle itself as proof of righteousness—'See how I wrestle with doubt! Surely this wrestling means I am on the right path.'\"\n\n\nHe sits back. \"This is why I am cautious tonight. Not because your words ring false. They ring true. But so did your words in Rome. So did your words after the Infantes. So did your words this morning. The test is not the words. The test is tomorrow morning, when the world presses upon you again.\"\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\"Does this specificity help you see, Your Majesty?

He's a careful pastor trying to help Juan understand himself. He'd probably pick the case that most clearly illustrates the pattern and that Juan can most easily examine.\n\nThis morning is too fresh and might feel like pile-on.\nThe Infantes is less about spiritual state, more political.\nRome to Granada is the foundational example.\nFather Tomás is specifically about the messianic thinking concern.\n\nI think Hernando would choose either Rome or Father Tomás. Given that Father Tomás specifically addresses the core concern - messianic thinking - and Juan experienced real spiritual wrestling there, that might be most useful.\n\nBut Rome is the origin. The pattern starts there.\n\nLet me have Hernando choose Rome to Granada, as it shows the full arc most clearly and is the foundation of everything that followed.\n\nIn terms of what specifically was wrong - Hernando needs to be precise here. The issue isn't that Juan did the crusade or conquered Granada. The issue is:\n1. The shift from \"I offer myself to God's will\" to \"God's will is clearly my crusade\"\n2. Taking success as divine confirmation\n3. The certainty that grew rather than humility\n4. Speaking of divine mission rather than faithful service\n\n\n5. The expansion from completing Reconquista to \"eternal crusade\" to reforming the Church\n\nI see how Juan's spiritual journey transforms from humble service to grandiose mission. The progression reveals a dangerous theological drift: from responding to God's call to believing he can dictate God's plan. His initial reverence mutates into a sense of personal divine mandate, where conquering Granada becomes merely a starting point for a broader, self-defined redemptive project. This represents a profound spiritual corruption - mistaking personal ambition for divine purpose.\n\n\nFray Hernando nods slowly, his expression thoughtful. \"You wish to understand deeply. This is good. Very well.\"\n\n\nHe is quiet for a moment, considering. Then he speaks.\n\n\n\"Let us examine Rome to Granada. The foundation of everything that followed.\"\n\n\nThe friar rises and moves to the window, his back to Juan as he gathers his thoughts. When he turns, his face carries the gravity of a man about to perform surgery on a soul.\n\n\n\"Rome, July 1430. You stood before Pope Martin and stripped yourself naked. Do you remember what you said? 'I am nothing. I offer everything. Let God use me as He wills.' You asked for nothing. You demanded nothing. You submitted yourself entirely.\" Hernando's voice carries admiration. \"This was genuine humility, Your Majesty. I have rarely seen its like. You truly meant it in that moment.\"\n\n\nHe returns to his chair, sitting heavily. \"But then. The Pope weeps. The cardinals weep. They grant you everything—crusade bull, relics, gold, letters of endorsement. And what happens in your heart, Your Majesty? Tell me honestly—what did you feel when Martin placed the True Cross fragment in your hands?\"\n\n\nHe doesn't wait for an answer. \"I watched your face. I saw the transformation. It was subtle, but I saw it. The humility remained, yes, but something else crept in. Confirmation. 'God has accepted my offering. God has blessed my crusade. God has chosen me.'\"\n\n\nHernando leans forward, his dark eyes intense. \"Here is where the error begins, Your Majesty. You went to Rome saying 'Let God use me as He wills.' You left Rome saying 'God wills that I crusade.' Do you see? The submission became certainty. The question became answer. Your offer to serve became conviction of mission.\"\n\n\nHe raises a hand before Juan can respond. \"I know what you will say. 'But Father, God did respond. The Pope did grant everything. Surely this was divine confirmation?' And here is the danger. Yes, God may have blessed your crusade. Yes, perhaps He did choose you for this work. I do not say He did not. But Your Majesty, a gift received is not the same as a mission ordained. A blessing given is not the same as certainty earned.\"\n\n\nThe friar's voice drops lower. \"Think of Abraham. God called him to sacrifice Isaac. Abraham obeyed—not because he understood, but because he trusted. And at the last moment, God stayed his hand. Now imagine if Abraham had concluded: 'God stayed my hand, therefore I understand His purposes perfectly. I am His chosen instrument and know exactly what He wants.' Would this not be presumption? Would this not take a moment of grace and twist it into a claim of special knowledge?\"\n\n\nHernando stands again, pacing slowly. \"Your crusade succeeded. Granada fell. Thousands converted. All of this may indeed be God's work through you. But Your Majesty, with each victory, your language changed. In Barcelona, you spoke of 'hoping to serve God.' By Seville, you spoke of 'God's divine mission through Castile.' By Granada's fall, you spoke of 'eternal crusade' and 'reforming all of Christendom.'\"\n\n\nHe stops pacing and faces Juan directly. \"The sin is not in the victories. The sin is in what you made of them. Each success became proof of your divine mandate rather than occasion for deeper humility. 'I must be right because I succeeded' rather than 'I succeeded by grace despite my unworthiness.' You took God's gifts and fashioned them into a throne for your own certainty.\"\n\n\nThe friar's voice softens but loses none of its precision. \"The truly humble man, Your Majesty, receives blessing and asks 'What more must I learn?' You received blessing and concluded 'Now I understand.' The faithful servant completes a task and waits for the next instruction. You completed Granada and immediately knew that Constantinople, the Ottomans, the Church itself were your next tasks—not because God told you so, but because your success convinced you that your vision must be His vision.\"\n\n\nHe returns to his chair, his eyes never leaving Juan's face. \"This is what was not in accordance with grace: not the crusade itself, but the certainty that grew from it. Not the victories, but the conviction that victories proved your righteousness. Not serving God, but believing you had become indispensable to His plans.\"\n\n\nA long pause.\n\n\n\"Does this help you see more clearly? Or do you wish to examine further?\"\n\n\n\nHow does Juan respond?"

He wants to understand precisely what the problematic thought or action was. Fray Hernando has been quite verbose, and Juan is trying to distill it down to something concrete and actionable.\n\nHernando should respond directly to this question - yes, essentially that's part of it, but he might want to be even more precise. The core issue is:\n\n1. Taking God's gifts (papal blessing, victories) as confirmation of Juan's own vision\n2. Moving from \"I am an instrument God may use\" to \"I am THE instrument God is using for this specific grand plan\"\n3. The certainty that grew from success - believing his vision IS God's vision\n4. Becoming indispensable in his own mind\n\nHernando should affirm Juan's understanding but perhaps refine it further to help him see the subtle distinction. The sin isn't necessarily \"I am indispensable\" but more precisely \"My understanding of what God wants is correct BECAUSE I succeeded.\"\n\nLet me have Hernando be more precise and direct, since Juan is clearly trying to nail down the exact issue.\n\n\nFray Hernando pauses, considering Juan's question carefully. Then he shakes his head slowly.\n\n\n\"Close, but not quite precise enough. Let me be more exact.\"\n\n\nHe holds up his hand, counting on his fingers as he speaks.\n\n\n\"The thought was not 'I am indispensable to God's plan'—for you never claimed God could not work without you. The thought was more subtle, more dangerous: 'Because God blessed my actions, my understanding of His plan must be correct.'\"\n\n\nHe lowers his hand. \"You see the distinction? You did not claim to be irreplaceable. You claimed to understand. Each success became evidence that your vision—Granada, then Constantinople, then reform of Christendom—was what God wanted. Not because God told you so directly, but because your past successes proved you were reading His will correctly.\"\n\n\nThe friar leans forward. \"The action that followed from this thought? You stopped asking 'Lord, what do You want of me?' and began declaring 'Lord, I will accomplish this next thing for You.' You moved from servant awaiting instruction to general planning campaigns. From 'use me as You will' to 'I will do this in Your name.'\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"The specific sin, if we must name it precisely: presumption. Not pride exactly—you never claimed personal glory. Presumption. Assuming you knew God's will because He had blessed your past obedience. Taking His gifts as permission to plan His future work.\"\n\n\nHis dark eyes hold Juan's steadily. \"Does this sharper point pierce more clearly?\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say?"

He's realizing that his \"visions\" of God's kingdom - the unified Christendom, the eternal crusade, Constantinople saved, the Church reformed - these were his own dreams and ambitions that he attributed to divine revelation.\n\nFray Hernando has been trying to help Juan see this distinction. The fact that Juan is now articulating it himself - \"I presumed that what I saw was his actual kingdom, not just my dream\" - this is precisely the breakthrough Hernando has been hoping for.\n\nThis is a significant moment of self-awareness. Juan is recognizing the core error: mistaking his own vision for God's plan.\n\nHow should Hernando react? Given the earlier roll of 24 (Cautious Doubt), he's been skeptical but willing to engage. Now Juan is demonstrating real understanding - not just agreeing with Hernando's words, but actively working through the logic himself.\n\nThis should move Hernando. Not to immediate full acceptance (he's still cautious), but this is exactly the kind of self-examination he wanted to see. Juan isn't just parroting back what Hernando said - he's connecting it to specific moments (\"when I said I saw a glimpse of his kingdom\") and articulating the error in his own words.\n\nHernando should acknowledge this is correct understanding, but probably still maintain some caution. He might be encouraged but remind Juan that understanding the error intellectually is different from not repeating it. Or he might see this as genuinely hopeful.\n\nLet me write a response that shows Hernando is genuinely moved by this self-awareness, but maintains his pastoral caution.\n\n\nFray Hernando goes very still. His dark eyes fix on Juan's face with an intensity that borders on penetrating. For a long moment, he says nothing at all.\n\n\nThen, slowly, he exhales—a breath he seems to have been holding.\n\n\n\"Yes,\" he says quietly. \"Yes, Your Majesty. That is precisely it.\"\n\n\nHe rises from his chair and moves closer, his voice carrying a mixture of relief and continued caution. \"When you spoke of seeing a glimpse of His kingdom—the unified Christendom, the eternal crusade, the Church reformed, Constantinople saved—you saw something beautiful. Something that moved your heart. Something that felt holy.\"\n\n\nHe stops before Juan. \"But you presumed—and this is the exact word, the exact sin—you presumed that because it felt holy, it must be His actual plan. Because your heart burned with it, it must be divine revelation. Because you could see it so clearly, it must be what God sees.\"\n\n\nThe friar's voice softens. \"Your Majesty, your dreams may be noble. They may even align in some ways with what God desires. I do not say your vision is evil or wholly wrong. But a dream that feels like God's kingdom is not the same as knowing God's kingdom. A vision that burns in your heart is not the same as divine revelation. And certainty—that bone-deep certainty you felt—is not the same as truth.\"\n\n\nHe places a weathered hand on Juan's shoulder—the first gesture of physical connection he has offered all evening.\n\n\n\"Do you understand what you have just done, Your Majesty? You have named your own error in your own words. Not repeating my theology back to me. Not agreeing with what I said. You have seen it yourself. 'I presumed that what I saw was his actual kingdom, not just my dream.' This... this is the beginning of true discernment.\"\n\n\nHis hand tightens slightly on Juan's shoulder. \"But only the beginning. Tomorrow will test whether this insight survives the morning. The Council will be in session. Opportunities will present themselves. Your mind will whisper, 'But surely this one action...' And then we will see if tonight's clarity holds.\"\n\n\nHe releases Juan's shoulder and steps back. \"But tonight—tonight I am... encouraged. Cautiously, but genuinely.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say?"

This is a contemplative moment, so I should keep things relatively quiet and atmospheric, letting Juan have space for reflection.\n\nLet me set the scene properly - morning prayer at Basel Cathedral, his second day of reflection. Fray Hernando gave him a specific task: attend Council session, sit in back, note every impulse to act/fix/intervene.\n\nBut first he's going for morning prayer, which is separate from the Council session.\n\n\n\nFray Hernando nods. \"Rest well, Your Majesty. And remember—tomorrow you observe. You write. You bring me the list of your impulses. This is your task.\"\n\n\nHe makes the sign of the cross over Juan. \"May God grant you peaceful sleep and clarity of mind come morning.\"\n\n\n\nNIGHT\n\n\nJuan kneels beside his bed in the darkened room. The merchant's house is quiet, Basel settling into its nighttime rhythms outside the shuttered windows.\n\n\nHis prayer for Isabel is simple—not the grand petitions of a king, but the intimate words of a husband. For her health. For the child growing within her. For her safety in his absence. For forgiveness that he is here, in Basel, wrestling with Church politics, when she awaits him in Toledo with their daughter.\n\n\nHe imagines her in their chambers. Catalina, now fourteen months old, probably sleeping nearby. Isabel's hand perhaps resting on her swelling belly. Does she think of him? Does she pray for him as he prays for her?\n\n\nSoon, my love. I will return to you.\n\n\nSleep comes eventually, though not easily. His dreams are fragmentary—saddle leather and cathedral spires, Greek metropolitans and Franciscan robes, all mixed together without clear meaning.\n\n\n\nMAY 30, 1433 - DAWN\n\n\nJuan wakes before first light. The second day of reflection.\n\n\nHe dresses simply again—noble's clothing, nothing ostentatious. In his pocket, he places a small piece of parchment and a stub of charcoal. His task: write down every impulse to act, to fix, to intervene.\n\n\nThe streets of Basel are quiet in the pre-dawn gray. A few early risers move through the shadows—bakers heading to ovens, servants beginning their work. The air is cool, carrying the smell of the river.\n\n\nBasel Cathedral looms ahead, its red sandstone towers dark against the lightening sky.\n\n\n\nJuan pushes through the heavy doors into the nave.\n\n\nThe cathedral is nearly empty at this hour. A few figures kneel in various chapels—clerics at their morning devotions. Candles flicker in their holders, creating pools of warm light in the vast dimness.\n\n\nThe smell of incense and old stone. The faint murmur of Latin prayers. The particular silence of sacred space.\n\n\nNo Council session yet—that will come later in the morning. For now, this is simply a church, a place of prayer.\n\n\n\nWhere in the cathedral does Juan go to pray? What does he pray about on this second day of reflection?"

The councils of the faithful must guide Your Church, not one man's pride in Rome...\"\n\n\nThe bishop pauses in his prayer, perhaps sensing someone nearby. He turns his head slightly, and Juan sees his face in the candlelight—perhaps fifty years old, gaunt features, eyes that burn with conviction. The face of a true believer, not a politician.\n\n\nThe man takes in Juan's noble dress, his Spanish appearance.

Juan has quoted Scripture (Matthew 18:20) and asked the bishop to join him in prayer.\n\nI need to think about how this bishop would react:\n- He's a true believer in conciliar supremacy\n- He was praying fervently about the Council's divine mission\n- He sees Castile as papal ally (correctly)\n- Juan has shown humility and knowledge of Scripture\n- The bishop doesn't know who Juan is yet\n- Prayer is sacred space - even enemies pray together\n\nThe bishop would likely be:\n- Cautiously receptive (it's prayer, after all)\n- Curious about this Spanish noble\n- Perhaps testing Juan's theological views\n- Guarded but not hostile\n\nThis should be a relatively straightforward positive response - the man is a sincere believer and Juan has approached with genuine humility and invoked Scripture. But the bishop will likely want to know more about this Spaniard.\n\n\nThe bishop's guarded expression softens slightly at Juan's words. The Scripture reference—where two or three gather in my name—is well-chosen. It speaks of community, of shared faith transcending divisions. And there is something in the Spaniard's manner, a simplicity of request, that seems genuine.\n\n\n\"You honor me with your invitation, not the other way around,\" the bishop replies, his French accent gentling the Latin syllables. He shifts on his knees, making room on the prayer rail. \"I am Jean, Bishop of... well, of a small diocese that does not matter here in Basel.

He reflects on his own presumptions briefly, engages in genuine dialogue but maintains core beliefs.\n\n\n\nRoll: 55/100 - Thoughtfully Challenged\n\n\n\nThe prayer hangs in the cathedral air. Bishop Jean remains silent for a long moment after Juan finishes, his head still bowed, his breathing slow and measured.\n\n\nWhen he finally speaks, his voice has lost some of its earlier fierceness. \"Amen,\" he says quietly. Then, after another pause: \"That is... not the prayer I expected from a Spanish noble.\"\n\n\nHe lifts his head, turning to look at Juan properly. His gaunt face shows the marks of someone wrestling with the words he has just heard.\n\n\n\"You speak of presumption. Of knowing better.\" The bishop's French accent thickens slightly as he chooses his words carefully. \"I confess, when I pray each morning, I do not pray about my presumptions. I pray for courage to fight for what I know to be right. I pray for strength to oppose tyranny. I do not ask myself... whether my certainty is itself the sin.\"\n\n\nHe shifts on his knees, his expression troubled but not defensive. \"You ask whether you should call yourself conciliarist or papalist instead of asking if you are good Christian. This is... this challenges me. I have spent these eight months here certain—certain—that the Council represents Christ's will, that Rome's claims are prideful usurpation of Christ's authority given to all the faithful, not one man.\"\n\n\nBishop Jean's hands, still clasped, tighten slightly. \"And yet. You kneel here and confess that every time you hear of reform, you presume to know better. You say this as sin. And I think... do I not do the same? When I hear the papal loyalists speak, do I not immediately presume they are wrong, that I see clearly what they do not?\"\n\n\nHe is quiet for a moment, staring at the altar. \"But here is where I struggle with your prayer, my Spanish friend. You ask 'what can I do?' and answer yourself that only God can move hearts. You speak of placing faith in trust and guarding against presumption. All of this is... humble. True. But...\"\n\n\nThe bishop turns back to Juan, and his eyes carry the fire that was in his earlier prayers. \"But sometimes, is action not required? When the Church bleeds from corruption—when bishops hold ten benefices while their flocks starve, when simony rules in Rome, when the faithful cry out for reform—is it enough to guard against presumption? Or does God require us to act, even imperfectly, even presumptuously?\"\n\n\nHis voice drops lower. \"I do not know you, Spanish lord. But I see you struggle honestly with these questions. So I ask you: if you see evil and have power to fight it, is it not also sin to do nothing? To hide behind humility while corruption flourishes?\"\n\n\n\nHow does Juan respond to this challenge?"

He's expressing frustration about fighting corruption while being cautious about presumption. Then he mentions the Castilian delegation and their reform proposals.\n\nI need to think about how Bishop Jean would react to this. Let me consider:\n\n1. Juan is showing passion (\"draw my sword immediately\")\n2. He's acknowledging the pain of fighting fellow Christians\n3. He's expressing frustration about everyone pushing their own vision\n4. He's trying to find common ground - what unites them\n5. He's pointing to the Castilian delegation's reform proposals\n\nBishop Jean is a passionate French conciliarist. The French faction at Basel wants Council supremacy - they believe councils should be supreme over popes. The Castilian delegation has been positioned as moderates, bridge-builders. They've proposed actual reforms.\n\nHow would Bishop Jean react?\n\nHe would likely:\n- Respond to Juan's passion positively (a man of action)\n- Note the Castilian delegation's work - he knows of it\n- But also potentially see Juan as still fence-sitting on the key issue (papal vs. conciliar authority)\n- The \"what unites us\" approach might appeal or might seem like avoiding the core question\n\nGiven the previous roll of 55 (Thoughtfully Challenged), he's engaging genuinely but maintaining his convictions. He's being moved to think but not abandoning his position.\n\nI should have him respond to:\n1. The passion Juan shows\n2. The acknowledgment of common ground on corruption\n3. The Castilian delegation - yes, he would know of them\n4. But push back on what he sees as the fundamental issue being avoided\n\nThis shouldn't require a roll - it's natural dialogue continuation. I'll write his response maintaining his character while showing he's engaged.\n\n\nBishop Jean's eyebrows rise slightly at Juan's sudden passion—the talk of swords and riding out. A flicker of something like recognition crosses his gaunt face. This is not merely a contemplative soul. There is steel here.\n\n\n\"Draw your sword against corruption,\" he repeats, nodding slowly. \"Yes. Yes, this I understand. This speaks to me more than prayers about guarding against presumption.\" His French-accented Latin carries approval. \"A man who would fight—this is what the Church needs. Not more men who sit and philosophize while Rome burns.\"\n\n\nAt the mention of the Castilian delegation, the bishop's expression sharpens with recognition. \"The Castilians, yes. I know their work. Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena speaks well in the congregations. Your countrymen have proposed reforms—pluralism, simony, clerical concubinage. Good reforms. Sound reforms. Three of their proposals have been incorporated into Council decrees.\"\n\n\nHe shifts on his knees, turning more fully toward Juan. \"But here is the thing, my Spanish friend. Your delegation proposes reforms, and this is good. But they dance around the central question. They seek middle ground where no middle ground exists.\"\n\n\nHis voice grows more intense, though not hostile. \"You say we should focus on what unites us—fighting corruption. Yes, agreed. But how do we fight it? This is where we divide. If the Pope can veto any reform the Council passes, what good are our decrees? If Eugenius can dissolve this Council tomorrow—as he tried to do!—then our work means nothing.\"\n\n\nBishop Jean leans closer, his dark eyes burning. \"The Castilians say 'let both authorities claim credit for reform.' Clever. Diplomatic. But it avoids the question: when Pope and Council disagree, who decides? If we pass decree against simony and Pope says no, what then? We go home with our principles intact and Rome continues as before?\"\n\n\nHe sits back slightly. \"You ask what a noble can do. I say: a noble with influence can speak the truth. Can say clearly: the Council of the faithful, guided by Holy Spirit, must have authority to reform the Church—even over papal objection. This is not presumption. This is Scripture. Where two or three gather in Christ's name, He is there. Not the Pope alone. We, the gathered faithful.\"\n\n\nA pause. He studies Juan's face. \"Your delegation seeks compromise. But some evils cannot be compromised with. Do you see?\"\n\n\n\nHow does Juan respond?"

I understand this. I have... I had a sister. She died in the plague years. Some evils are clear. Absolute.\"\n\n\nHe looks back at the altar, at the painted Saint Peter with his keys.

I fear that if I pray with you in spirit of compromise and letting go, I betray everything I have fought for. I fear that your words, however sincere, are the voice of... what is the word... of accommodation with evil. That I will wake tomorrow softer, less willing to fight, and the corruption will continue because men like me chose peace over truth.\"\n\n\nHis hands clench and unclench. \"And yet I also fear that my certainty is the presumption you prayed about.

Because we are trying to discern God's will through the gathered faithful, through Scripture and tradition and prayer. This is supposed to be difficult. The Holy Spirit does not rush.\"\n\n\nHis eyes narrow slightly. \"And what does the Pope offer? Efficiency, yes. One man decides, the Church moves. But efficiency in service of what? When Pope John XXIII sold indulgences to fund his wars, he was very efficient. When simony rules in Rome, it is very efficiently organized. When ten benefices are held by one bishop while parishes starve, the papal bureaucracy processes the paperwork very smoothly.\"\n\n\nBishop Jean leans forward. \"You say you see benefits in one figurehead moving Christendom in one direction.

It is curse.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, and something else crosses his face—a flicker of awareness. \"But wait, my friend. Did you not just pray—not fifteen minutes ago—about your sin of presumption? About presuming to know better whenever you hear of reform? About how we all push for what WE think is right?\"\n\n\nThe bishop's gaze sharpens. \"And now here you are, offering me your perspective on how the Church should be structured. Proposing that perhaps Pope and Council can both exist. Is this not... is this not exactly what you confessed as your temptation? The impulse to fix, to propose solutions, to presume you see clearly?\"\n\n\nHis voice is not accusatory—more curious, as if catching Juan in the very act he described.\n\n\n\"I do not say this to shame you. I say it because... because I think you caught yourself in your own words just now. You spoke of letting go, of not presuming. And yet here we are, two men in chapel, and we have moved from prayer to politics in moments. Perhaps this is what always happens. Perhaps neither of us can help ourselves.\"\n\n\nHe sits back slightly. \"So tell me honestly, Spanish lord—do you truly not know what to do, as you said?

They're noticing a pattern in my GM behavior and want to understand it. Let me think about this honestly.\n\nThe player is right to notice this pattern. Let me examine what's happening:\n\n1. **Juan's actual behavior**: He's offering his perspective in a conversation, clearly stating \"I do not presume to offer advice\" and \"maybe it can work for you.\" He's sharing thoughts, not demanding action. This is normal human discourse.\n\n2. **My NPC reactions**: I've been having characters (Fray Hernando, now Bishop Jean) immediately pounce on any hint of Juan having opinions or thoughts about reform as evidence of dangerous presumption.\n\n3. **Why am I doing this?**\n\nLooking at the NPC guide and my instructions, I think I've been over-correcting. The guide warns against NPCs being too agreeable, too helpful to player goals. But I may have swung too far in the opposite direction—making NPCs *hyper-vigilant* about Juan's flaws in unrealistic ways.\n\nReal people don't actually do this:\n- A French bishop wouldn't immediately psychoanalyze a stranger's prayer and catch them in \"their pattern\"\n- A confessor might be cautious, but wouldn't turn every comment into evidence of sin\n- Normal conversation includes sharing perspectives without it being \"presumption\"\n\nI think several things are happening:\n\n1. **Over-applying the spiritual arc**: I've been so focused on Juan's character development around presumption that I'm making every NPC reinforce this theme, which becomes preachy and unrealistic.\n\n2. **Misreading the NPC guide**: The guide says NPCs should pursue their own interests and resist helping player goals. But that doesn't mean they should constantly lecture the player character about his flaws. Bishop Jean should be defending his conciliarist position, not psychoanalyzing Juan.\n\n3. **Confusing \"realistic resistance\" with \"catching the player in sins\"**: Realistic NPCs would argue their positions, not act as moral police.\n \nI'm forcing every interaction to become a referendum on Juan's spiritual journey, turning nuanced characters into one-dimensional moral arbiters. This approach flattens the narrative, making conversations feel contrived and predictable.

Let me explain what's happening:\n\n\nThe Problem:\n\n\nI've been over-applying the spiritual crisis/presumption arc to the point where every NPC becomes a vehicle for reinforcing that theme. Bishop Jean—a man who just met Juan, knows nothing about him, and has his own fierce convictions—suddenly becomes another mirror reflecting Juan's sins back at him. That's not realistic. That's me as GM being heavy-handed.\n\n\nWhy it's happening:\n\n\nOver-correction from the NPC guide: The guide warns against NPCs being too agreeable. But I've swung too far—making NPCs hyper-vigilant critics instead of people pursuing their own interests.\n\nTheme obsession: I've made every interaction about Juan's spiritual development rather than letting NPCs be people with their own concerns. Bishop Jean should be passionately defending conciliarism, not psychoanalyzing a stranger.\n\nConfusing \"resistance\" with \"lecturing\": Realistic resistance means NPCs argue their positions and pursue their goals. It doesn't mean they constantly catch the player in moral failings.\n\n\nWhat should actually happen:\n\n\nBishop Jean is a true believer in conciliar supremacy. He should:\n\n\nArgue his position passionately\n\nPush back on Juan's political points\n\nDefend his worldview\n\nNOT suddenly become a confessor figure analyzing Juan's patterns\n\n\nJuan offering a perspective in conversation is not \"presumption\"—it's normal human discourse. I've been treating every thought Juan has as evidence of spiritual danger.\n\n\nWould you like me to rewrite Bishop Jean's response as he would actually behave—a man defending his convictions rather than catching Juan in theological traps?"

I've been turning every NPC into a mirror for Juan's spiritual crisis, making them hyper-aware of his presumption and constantly lecturing him about it. This is unrealistic.\n\nBishop Jean is a passionate French conciliarist who:\n- Believes firmly in Council supremacy\n- Has spent 8 months fighting for this cause\n- Sees papal corruption as existential threat\n- Just met this Spanish noble\n- Should be arguing HIS position, not psychoanalyzing Juan\n\nWhen Juan offers his perspective on Pope vs. Council, Bishop Jean should:\n- Engage with the political argument\n- Defend conciliar supremacy\n- Push back on Juan's points about papal efficiency\n- Maybe find some common ground or not\n- Act like a man with convictions, not a confessor\n\nLet me rewrite this properly.\n\n\n\nREWRITE: Bishop Jean's Response\n\n\n\nBishop Jean's expression shifts as Juan speaks. The vulnerability of moments ago gives way to familiar ground—this is the debate he has lived for eight months. His eyes sharpen with the intensity of a true believer who has heard these arguments before.\n\n\n\"Can both exist?\" he repeats, leaning forward. \"My Spanish friend, this is precisely what the moderates always say. 'Can we not have both? Can we not find middle ground?' And I tell you—no. No, we cannot.\"\n\n\nHe gestures toward the nave, toward the empty benches where the Council will soon gather. \"You say we take years to decide anything. Yes. True. Frustrating, maddening even. But do you know what the Pope decided in one day? To dissolve this Council entirely. One man, one decision—'these gathered bishops trouble me, so they are dismissed.' Is this the efficiency you admire?\"\n\n\nThe bishop's French accent thickens with passion. \"Pope Eugenius tried to end us with a stroke of his pen. Only because Emperor Sigismund threatened to withdraw support did he relent. One man nearly destroyed the only hope for reform because it inconvenienced him. This is your figurehead moving Christendom in one direction.\"\n\n\nHe shakes his head firmly. \"You speak of benefits of papal leadership. I speak of decades of simony, of benefices sold to highest bidder, of bishops who have never seen their flocks, of corruption so deep it rots the Church from within. The Pope has had centuries to reform these evils. What has he done? Nothing. Because reform threatens his power.\"\n\n\nBishop Jean's voice rises. \"But when the Council—the gathered faithful guided by Holy Spirit—passes decrees against pluralism, against simony, against concubinage, suddenly reform is possible. Why? Because we answer to Christ and Scripture, not to Roman politics.\"\n\n\nHe fixes Juan with an intense stare. \"You ask if both can exist. I ask you: when father and children disagree on what is right, who decides? If father says 'we will steal from neighbors' and children say 'this is sin'—do we compromise? Do we steal only a little? No. The father who leads into sin must be corrected by the faithful who know better.\"\n\n\nThe bishop sits back, breathing hard. \"This is not about power, my Spanish friend. This is about truth. The Pope is not infallible. He is man, capable of sin, capable of error. The gathered Council, praying and discerning together, is more likely to find God's will than one man surrounded by corrupt advisors in Rome.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then adds more quietly: \"But I understand your concern. We are slow. We fight amongst ourselves. Perhaps this is our weakness. Perhaps God tests us to see if we can govern ourselves better than one tyrant governs us. I do not know if we will pass this test.\"\n\n\nA slight softening around his eyes. \"You Castilians sit in the middle, proposing compromises. I do not hate you for it. But I believe you are wrong. Some fights require choosing sides, not building bridges.\"\n\n\n\nHow does Juan respond?"

He's not arguing theology or Church structure - he's pointing to a concrete, urgent problem: Constantinople needs help NOW, and Council process is too slow. This is a practical argument that cuts through ideology.\n\nBishop Jean is a true believer in conciliar supremacy, but he's also not stupid. He can recognize a valid point when he hears one. The Constantinople crisis is real, the Byzantines are desperate, and Council process IS slow.\n\nHow would he respond?\n\nHe might:\n1. Acknowledge the problem but argue Council could act faster if united\n2. Point out that papal \"efficiency\" hasn't saved Constantinople either\n3. Admit this is a weakness of conciliar process\n4. Argue that long-term reform is more important than short-term crisis\n5. Feel the force of Juan's argument and struggle with it\n\nGiven the roll (55/100 - Conflicted Engagement), he's already in a state where Juan's words are making him think. This practical argument about Constantinople might really land.\n\nHe's a French conciliarist who believes in reform, but he's also presumably a Christian who cares about fellow Christians under Ottoman threat. The Greeks have been pleading for eight months with little result.\n\nI think he would:\n- Acknowledge the point is valid\n- Feel the weight of it\n- Maybe try to defend Council process but less convincingly\n- Possibly admit this is real problem for his position\n- Not completely abandon his views but genuinely grapple with the issue\n\nThis is a case where Juan's point is strong and the bishop should respond to its actual merit.\n\n\nBishop Jean opens his mouth to respond—then closes it. His gaunt face shows the impact of Juan's words. This is not abstract theology. This is Constantinople. The Greeks. Real people dying while the Council debates.\n\n\nFor a long moment, he says nothing.\n\n\n\"The Greeks,\" he finally says, his voice quieter. \"Yes. I have seen them. Metropolitan Bessarion, Metropolitan Isidore. They sit in our sessions. They wait. They plead. Eight months they have been here.\" His jaw tightens. \"Eight months, and what have we given them? Words. Sympathy. Promises to discuss their situation.\"\n\n\nHe runs a hand over his face, suddenly looking tired. \"You ask if the Council would grant you crusade before Constantinople falls. I...\" He trails off, then shakes his head slowly. \"No. No, I do not think we would. The French delegation would demand conditions. The Germans would want guarantees. The Italians would fight over who commands. Each deputation would need internal consensus. Months of debate while the Ottomans...\"\n\n\nThe bishop's voice hardens with frustration—but it is directed inward now, not at Juan. \"This is... this is a fair blow you strike, Spanish lord. A very fair blow.\"\n\n\nHe stares at the altar, at Saint Peter with his keys. \"I have argued that Council discernment, though slow, finds God's will better than one man's decree. But if God's will is to save Constantinople—to protect our brothers in Christ from the Turk—and we cannot act fast enough to do it...\" He does not finish the sentence.\n\n\nWhen he looks back at Juan, there is something like pain in his eyes. \"So what do you propose? That we abandon reform because the Pope can act quickly? That we accept tyranny because efficiency saves lives? This is... this is a devil's bargain you describe.\"\n\n\nHis voice drops lower. \"Or perhaps you are saying something else. Perhaps you are saying the Council's weakness is not in our principles but in our practice. That we could act decisively if we chose to, but we are too busy fighting each other to save those who need saving.\"\n\n\nHe falls silent, waiting for Juan's response.\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say?"

He's been hit with a fair point about Constantinople that he couldn't dismiss, and now Juan is pushing him further - not attacking his principles but questioning his approach. At a 59, he should struggle with this honestly, really consider whether he's been fighting the enemy (the Pope) instead of the problem (corruption). He should begin to actually think about Juan's question.\n\nBut this shouldn't be too easy or transformative. He's still a true believer with eight months of conviction behind him.

His gaunt face shows the struggle—pride warring with honesty, conviction wrestling with self-examination.\n\n\nA long silence stretches between them.

And every morning I wake thinking: how do we defeat the Pope's resistance today? How do we force Rome to accept our authority? How do we prove the conciliarists are right?\" He looks down at his hands. \"You are correct. I have been fighting Pope Eugenius. Not corruption. Not simony. Not the suffering of the faithful. The Pope.\"\n\n\nHe draws a slow breath. \"When did I stop asking 'how do we fix the Church' and start asking 'how do we win against Rome'? I do not even remember.\"\n\n\nThe bishop looks back at Juan, and there is something raw in his expression—a man catching sight of himself in an unexpected mirror. \"You ask how the Church could be both considerate and decisive. How we could reform without this endless paralysis, without one man's tyranny.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"This is... this is what we should have been discussing all along, is it not? Not who holds supreme authority, but how do we actually govern Christ's Church wisely?\"\n\n\nHe is quiet for another moment, thinking. \"Perhaps... perhaps the Council's weakness is not inherent. Perhaps it is because we have made every question a battle of authority instead of a search for wisdom. We debate who has the right to decide, never reaching the decision itself.\"\n\n\nBishop Jean runs a hand through his thinning hair. \"But I confess, my Spanish friend, I do not know the answer to your question. How does a body of hundreds act decisively? How does one man act considerately? These seem... contradictory. The very things that make the Council wise—many voices, careful deliberation—make it slow. The very things that make the Pope decisive—singular authority—make him prone to tyranny.\"\n\n\nHe looks at Juan with genuine curiosity now, the ideologue giving way to the seeker. \"You ask me because I know the Church. But I think perhaps you see something I do not. You have governed a kingdom, yes? You have made decisions that affect thousands. How do you balance consideration and decisiveness? Is there wisdom you have learned that might apply here?\"\n\n\n\nHow does Juan respond?"

Forgive us.\"\n\n\nHis voice strengthens slightly. \"We ask Your guidance for this Church that tears itself apart. We ask Your protection for Constantinople and all who face the sword. We ask Your wisdom for Juan, who seeks to help and fears his own pride. We ask Your patience for me, who fights so fiercely he forgets to listen.\"\n\n\nAnother pause. When he continues, there is warmth in his words.\n\n\n\"And Lord, we thank You for this moment. For bringing two strangers together in Your house. For showing us that we can disagree and still be brothers. For reminding us that where two or three gather in Your name, You are there among them. Not in our certainties. Not in our arguments. But in our honest seeking, our willingness to listen, our desire to serve.\"\n\n\nHe draws a breath. \"Be with Juan's wife, Lord. Protect her and the child she carries. Grant him safe return to her. And grant us all—this Council, this Church, all of Christendom—the wisdom to know Your will and the courage to do it, even when it costs us our pride.\"\n\n\nHis voice softens to barely above a whisper. \"In Christ's name we pray. Amen.\"\n\n\nThe bishop lifts his head, and when he looks at Juan, there is genuine fellowship in his eyes—the look of one Christian to another, stripped of politics and position.\n\n\n\"Thank you, Juan of Castile,\" he says quietly. \"You have given me much to think about. Perhaps I have been so busy fighting for the Church that I forgot what the Church should be.\"\n\n\nHe rises slowly, his aging knees protesting. \"I do not know if I can help you with the Council. But I will remember this morning. And perhaps... perhaps I will fight differently now. Less like warrior, more like...\" He searches for the word. \"More like saddler, yes? Fixing what is broken, not conquering what opposes.\"\n\n\nA slight smile. \"Go with God, Juan. And I will pray for your wife. Truly.\"\n\n\n\nHow does Juan respond before the bishop departs?"

The bishop already introduced himself earlier as \"Jean, Bishop of... well, of a small diocese that does not matter here in Basel.\" But he didn't give his full title or diocese name. Juan is asking for this information now, which makes sense as they part ways.\n\nThe bishop should give his full name and diocese. He's French, a conciliarist, described as having a small diocese. I should make this historically plausible - a minor French diocese whose bishop would be at the Council.\n\n\nBishop Jean clasps Juan's hand firmly. His grip is strong despite his gaunt frame—the grip of a man who has conviction, even if that conviction has been shaken this morning.\n\n\n\"Jean de Rochetaillée,\" he says. \"Bishop of Senez. A small diocese in Provence—perhaps forty parishes, most of them poor. Not important in the grand scheme of things.\" A wry smile crosses his weathered face. \"Which is perhaps why I fight so hard for the Council. Men like me have no voice in Rome. Here, at least, my vote counts the same as a cardinal's.\"\n\n\nHe releases Juan's hand but holds his gaze a moment longer. \"And perhaps that is why I needed to hear what you said today. I have been so grateful to finally have a voice that I forgot to ask what I should say with it.\"\n\n\nThe bishop straightens his threadbare purple robes with what dignity he can muster. \"If you need someone to speak for you in the French delegation—to argue that helping Constantinople is more important than our internal fights—I cannot promise success. But I can promise honesty. I will tell them what I witnessed here. A king who knelt in prayer with a stranger. Who admitted his own presumptions. Who asked questions instead of giving orders.\"\n\n\nHe bows his head slightly—not the deep obeisance due a king, but the respectful nod of one Christian to another.\n\n\n\"Go with God, Juan of Castile. And if your wife is half as wise as you, your kingdom is blessed indeed.\"\n\n\nWith that, Bishop Jean de Rochetaillée turns and walks away through the cathedral, his footsteps echoing on the stone floor. His posture seems somehow different than when Juan first saw him—less rigid, perhaps. Less burdened by certainty.\n\n\n\nThe cathedral is quieter now. Morning light streams through the high windows, casting colored patterns on the floor. What does Juan do next?"

They want communion in both kinds (chalice for laity), vernacular preaching, and importantly - retention of seized Church properties. This is where it gets complicated because Bohemian nobles hold millions in stolen Church lands.\n\nLet me create a scene where Juan observes this debate and feels his impulses to \"fix\" things. I should NOT generate Juan's actions or thoughts - just present what happens and let the player respond.\n\n\n\nRoll: 48/100 - Hussite Negotiation Update\n\n\n\nThe debate on pluralism enforcement grinds to its inevitable halt—remanded to committee for further study. Cardinal Cesarini's weary voice calls the next matter.\n\n\n\"Brothers, we now hear report from the delegation treating with the Bohemian representatives. Bishop Philibert, if you please.\"\n\n\nA portly French bishop rises, clutching a sheaf of papers. His face shows the strain of a man caught between impossible positions.\n\n\n\"Your Eminences, the negotiations with the Bohemian delegation have reached... a delicate juncture.\"\n\n\nA murmur ripples through the assembly. Juan leans forward slightly, listening.\n\n\n\"The Utraquists—the moderate Hussites—have presented their Four Articles of Prague once more. They demand: first, communion in both kinds for the laity. Second, free preaching of the Word in vernacular tongue. Third, civil punishment of mortal sins, including by clergy. Fourth—and this remains the stumbling block—the return of the Church to apostolic poverty, with secular lords retaining properties seized during the wars.\"\n\n\nAn Italian cardinal rises immediately. \"This fourth article is theft dressed in theological clothing! They stole Church lands worth millions of florins and now claim apostolic precedent!\"\n\n\nA German delegate responds: \"They defeated five crusades, Your Eminence. Five. They hold those lands by right of arms if nothing else. What do you propose—another crusade? Shall we send more armies to die in Bohemia?\"\n\n\nBishop Philibert continues over the growing noise. \"The Bohemian representatives have made clear: without resolution on the property question, there can be no reconciliation. The nobles who hold these lands will not surrender them. To demand this is to demand war.\"\n\n\nA French voice calls out: \"Then grant them the properties! What matters more—gold and land, or souls returned to Christ?\"\n\n\nThe Italian cardinal again: \"And reward sacrilege? Tell every noble in Christendom that they may seize Church property with impunity, so long as they hold it long enough?\"\n\n\nCardinal Cesarini raises his hand for order. \"Brothers, please. The theological questions are complex enough without—\"\n\n\n\"The theology is not complex!\" Another voice, sharp with conviction. \"Communion in both kinds has precedent. Vernacular preaching can be discussed. But sanctifying theft? This undermines the Church's material foundation everywhere!\"\n\n\nBishop Philibert attempts to continue. \"The Bohemian delegation has proposed a compromise. The properties remain with current holders, but they pay annual tribute to Rome equivalent to what the Church would have received—\"\n\n\n\"So we become landlords collecting rent on stolen goods?\"\n\n\n\"Better landlords than paupers who lost a war!\"\n\n\nThe debate erupts. Faction against faction, but not along the usual lines. French delegates split amongst themselves. Germans divide. Even Italians argue with each other.\n\n\nJuan watches. Cesarini's face is a mask of exhaustion as he tries to maintain order.\n\n\nAnd beneath it all, the real question hangs unspoken: the Hussites defeated five crusades. They hold the military advantage. They negotiate from strength, not weakness. The Council can grant their demands or watch Bohemia remain permanently severed from Rome.\n\n\nThe charcoal stub rests in Juan's fingers. The parchment waits.\n\n\n\nWhat impulses, if any, does Juan feel as he watches this debate? Does he write anything on his parchment?"

Beside him, Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena sets down the document he was reviewing, his expression shifting from concentration to surprise.\n\n\nThree other clerics are present—minor delegates whose names Juan does not yet know. They all rise as recognition dawns.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Abbott Rodrigo says, bowing his head. \"We had heard you arrived in Basel. We did not expect... that is, we assumed you would summon us rather than...\" He trails off, clearly uncertain how to address a king who has simply walked into their working quarters unannounced.\n\n\nBishop Alfonso recovers more quickly. \"We are honored by your presence, Your Majesty.

He has support in Italy, in Spain—in Castile, Your Majesty, thanks in part to your alliance. If Basel deposes him, he will not simply accept it.

This is the frustrating paradox of Basel. On matters of reform—actual reform—we have accomplished more than any council in a century.\"\n\n\nHe rises and moves to one of the document-laden tables, selecting several parchments. \"Allow me to enumerate. We have passed decrees against pluralism—holding multiple benefices. Against simony—the buying and selling of Church offices. Against clerical concubinage. We have established rules for regular provincial synods. We have addressed abuses in papal taxation.\"\n\n\nAbbott Rodrigo adds, \"And our Castilian proposals have been well-received.

The French will demand conditions—perhaps that any crusade not strengthen papal authority. The Germans will want guarantees about command structure and finances. The Italians will split between those who see opportunity and those loyal to Rome.\"\n\n\nBishop Alfonso continues the count. \"Second, even if we pass such authorization, what weight does it carry? When Your Majesty rode to Granada, you carried Pope Martin's bull—recognized by all Christendom as legitimate call to holy war. Would Christian knights answer a Council bull with equal fervor? Or would they question its authority?\"\n\n\nThe Abbott's expression grows more troubled. \"Third, and perhaps most damning—a Council crusade bull would be seen as direct challenge to papal prerogative.

If you say 'I am bound by papal decree,' the reformers will say 'See? Another puppet of Rome.'\"\n\n\nThe Abbott rises slowly, moving to where Juan's papal decree sits on the table—he must have had access to copies. \"May I speak plainly about this document, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\nHe doesn't wait for permission. \"Pope Martin gave you this decree when he was dying.

You may be precisely what he needs—a voice with credibility on both sides.\"\n\n\nAbbott Rodrigo sits back down heavily. \"Or you may be seen as threat by both sides. It is... delicate.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say?"

This is a more human moment, checking in on the old man who has been here for eight months dealing with this mess. The Abbott is 73 years old, has been at this for eight months, and Juan is showing concern for him as a person, not just as a source of information.\n\nThis is a chance to show the Abbott as a human being, tired, perhaps losing hope, but still devoted to his duty.\n\n\n\nAbbott Rodrigo is quiet for a long moment. The question—personal, direct—seems to catch him off guard. He has spent eight months being the expert, the source of information, the steady hand guiding Castilian interests. Now a king asks him how he is doing.\n\n\nThe old man's shoulders sag slightly. His seventy-three years show more clearly in this unguarded moment.\n\n\n\"Hopeful?\" He almost laughs, but the sound is tired. \"Your Majesty, I confess... some days I am not certain what I hope for anymore.\"\n\n\nHe looks down at his gnarled hands. \"When we arrived in October, I believed we could make a difference. Castile as the moderate voice, the bridge-builder. We would help them find compromise, prevent schism, pass meaningful reform. Noble goals.\"\n\n\nA heavy sigh. \"Eight months later, I have watched the same arguments repeat endlessly. The same factions entrench deeper. The same fears drive men to extremes. I have seen Cardinal Cesarini age ten years in eight months. I have seen good men—men who love Christ and His Church—become so convinced of their righteousness that they cannot hear any voice but their own.\"\n\n\nBishop Alfonso looks at his elder colleague with concern. The Abbott rarely shows vulnerability like this.\n\n\n\"Tedious,\" Abbott Rodrigo repeats Juan's word. \"Yes. But also heartbreaking. Because beneath the tedium, Your Majesty, is something tragic. These are not evil men. Most of them genuinely want to heal the Church. But they are so afraid—afraid of schism, afraid of tyranny, afraid of losing what they have fought for—that they cannot move forward.\"\n\n\nHe looks up at Juan, and his aged eyes carry a profound weariness. \"Am I hopeful? I pray each morning for hope. Some days God grants it. Other days...\" He trails off.\n\n\nThen, with effort, he straightens in his chair. \"But we do our duty regardless of hope, yes? Castile sent us here to represent her interests and serve Christ's Church. We will continue until recalled or until God calls us home.\"\n\n\nA slight, sad smile. \"Though I confess, Your Majesty, your presence here—however brief—is first real hope I have felt in weeks. Perhaps you can accomplish what we cannot.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does Juan say?"

This is much more appropriate than trying to arrange it himself or having Fray Hernando do it. The delegation has been here eight months, they have established relationships and understand protocol.\n\nLet me think about how the delegation would respond to this request:\n\n1. This is a reasonable, expected request - a king with papal backing meeting the papal legate is proper protocol\n2. The delegation can facilitate this easily given their eight months of presence\n3. They will likely have thoughts on how to approach it, what to expect\n4.

The question is timing and what advice they might offer about the meeting.\n\n\n\nAbbott Rodrigo straightens in his chair, the weariness of moments ago giving way to the practiced diplomat. This is solid ground—arranging meetings, facilitating introductions, navigating protocol. This he knows how to do.\n\n\n\"Of course, Your Majesty. This is entirely appropriate and expected. In fact, Cardinal Cesarini will likely be relieved you have requested formal audience through proper channels rather than...\" He pauses delicately. \"Rather than approaching him directly.\"\n\n\nBishop Alfonso nods. \"We have established good relations with the Cardinal's household. I can send word this afternoon requesting audience at His Eminence's earliest convenience. Given your status and your papal decree, I expect he will make time quickly—tomorrow, perhaps even this evening if he is not otherwise engaged.\"\n\n\nAbbott Rodrigo adds, \"The Cardinal keeps demanding schedule, but he will not refuse King of Castile who carries papal blessing. The question is framing.\"\n\n\nHe looks at Juan carefully. \"How do you wish us to present this request, Your Majesty? As formal introduction of allied sovereign? As pastoral visit—king seeking spiritual counsel? As diplomatic matter regarding Constantinople and the Greeks? The framing will shape his expectations and thus the nature of your meeting.\"\n\n\nBishop Alfonso interjects, \"If I may suggest—given what you have shared about your concerns and your morning's reflections—perhaps framing it as request for counsel would serve best? It positions you as seeking guidance rather than arriving with demands. It gives Cardinal room to speak freely. And it aligns with...\" He glances at the Abbott. \"With the approach that seems to have served you well thus far in Basel.\"\n\n\nThe Abbott nods agreement. \"The Cardinal is drowning man, Your Majesty. He does not need another person telling him what to do. He needs someone who will listen.\"\n\n\n\nHow does Juan wish the meeting to be framed?"

This is a meta-conversation about the game itself, not in-character play.\n\nI should respond as GM, acknowledging their experience and perhaps discussing the historical reality and narrative implications. This was indeed a rich session - Juan's spiritual growth was significant, and the Basel situation is authentically frustrating. The player seems to appreciate that no deus ex machina dice roll can fix structural problems.\n\n\n\nGM Response:\n\n\nWhat a session indeed. And you've hit on something profound—Basel's deadlock isn't something a single extraordinary dice roll can break, because the problem isn't bad luck or hostile NPCs. It's structural. It's hundreds of intelligent, well-meaning men trapped in competing certainties, each convinced their vision is correct.\n\n\nThe beauty of what emerged this chapter is that Juan's powerlessness in Basel actually mirrors his spiritual breakthrough. The saddler's wisdom, Fray Hernando's challenges, Bishop Jean's fierce ideology—they all pointed to the same truth: you can't force a system to change by being right. You can't fix a saddle when the owner doesn't want it fixed.\n\n\nAnd Basel is fascinating because everyone is caught in their narrative:\n\n\nCesarini trying to hold a center that's dissolving\n\nThe French radicals certain that conciliar supremacy is God's will\n\nThe papal loyalists certain that hierarchy must be preserved\n\nBishop Jean fighting the Pope instead of corruption\n\nEven Juan, until this chapter, certain his vision was God's vision\n\n\nWhat made this session special was watching Juan recognize his own pattern and choose—at least for now—to step back. To observe. To record his impulses rather than act on them. To let the Castilian delegation do its work. To approach Cesarini through proper channels.\n\n\nThe dice gave you realistic outcomes: cautious allies, partial breakthroughs, genuine reflection without guaranteed transformation. No one was magically convinced by Juan's brilliance. Heinrich the saddler just shared his craft wisdom. Bishop Jean's ideology cracked slightly but didn't shatter. Hernando remained skeptical but hopeful.\n\n\nTomorrow's meeting with Cesarini could be significant—not because Juan will solve Basel's crisis, but because he might find a kindred spirit in exhaustion, someone else who sees the beast thrashing in its trap.\n\n\nHow are you feeling about Juan's arc? The shift from \"I must fix this\" to \"maybe I need to let go\"?"
