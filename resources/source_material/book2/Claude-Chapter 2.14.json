The player wants to make preparations for a trip to Madrid with Catalina.\n\n\nLet me search for any specific information about Madrid in this period.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nI have sufficient context now. Madrid in 1433 is described as a \"minor town, occasional royal residence\" with a population of only 3,000-4,000. It won't become the capital until 1561. Let me set the scene for preparations.\n\n\n\nThe morning light filters through the tall windows of the royal apartments as Doña Beatriz finishes dressing Catalina in a warm wool travelling gown of deep blue—the color that matches her father's eyes, the seamstresses always say. The little princess, now nearly twenty months old, has been informed that she will be going on a journey with Papá, and her excitement manifests in an inability to sit still for even a moment.\n\n\n\"Horses?\" she demands for perhaps the fourth time.\n\n\n\"Yes, mi pequeña, there will be horses,\" Doña Beatriz confirms patiently, attempting to secure a small cap over Catalina's dark curls.\n\n\nIn the adjoining chamber, servants are packing the lighter items—clothing, toys, the carved wooden animals Catalina refuses to sleep without. The heavier baggage wagons were loaded before dawn.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna arrives to consult on final arrangements, a scroll tucked under his arm. \"Your Majesty. The advance party departed at first light—twelve men to ensure the road is clear and the royal hunting lodge prepared. The main escort will be ready within the hour.\" He pauses, glancing at the document. \"Forty men-at-arms should be sufficient for the journey. Madrid is only thirteen leagues from Toledo—we should arrive well before nightfall if we depart by mid-morning.\"\n\n\nThe road north follows the Tagus for a time before cutting across the gentle hills of the Castilian plateau. Madrid itself sits on the Manzanares River, a modest town that serves primarily as a waystation on the road north to Burgos and as an occasional hunting retreat for Castilian kings. The royal lodge there, while far smaller than the Alcázar of Toledo, has the advantage of relative simplicity—fewer courtiers, fewer demands, more time with family.\n\n\n\"The Queen has sent word she will meet us at the main gate,\" Álvaro adds. \"She wishes to see you both off personally.\""

She's watching her ladies with an expression caught between amusement and exasperation.\n\n\nWhen she sees you, her face softens. \"Ah. My husband arrives to find his household in disarray.\" She gestures at the scene. \"I told them two may accompany us and four must remain. You would think I had asked them to choose which of their sisters to throw from a tower.\"\n\n\nDonna Francesca, the senior lady-in-waiting, turns with dignity somewhat undermined by the silk stocking she appears to be using to mark her place in the argument. \"Your Majesty, we are merely ensuring the Queen's comfort is properly attended to. Madrid is a small town—\"\n\n\n\"Madrid is a hunting lodge,\" Lucia corrects. \"We are not receiving ambassadors. We are taking Catalina to see snow, if God grants us any, and giving my husband a week without councilors asking him to sign things.\"\n\n\nShe crosses to you, lowering her voice. \"Francesca and Isabella will come—Francesca because she will sulk for a month if I leave her, and Isabella because she rides well and complains little. The others will remain to terrorize Fernando's household and ensure the Alcázar does not collapse in our absence.\"\n\n\nHer grey-green eyes search your face. \"You look as though you have something on your mind beyond ladies' quarrels.\""

She is light enough that neither horse will notice the difference, and she will be happier being passed between us than strapped into a litter watching the world go by without her.\" A slight smile. \"Besides, you have seen her on horseback. She was born to ride. The more time in the saddle, the better.\"\n\n\nDonna Francesca clears her throat delicately. \"Your Majesties, if I may—the Princess is not yet two years old. Thirteen leagues is a full day's journey. She will need to sleep at some point, and sleeping on horseback at a trot...\"\n\n\n\"Then we stop when she sleeps,\" Lucia says simply. \"We are not racing to lift a siege. If we arrive an hour later because Catalina needed to nap in someone's arms under a tree, the hunting lodge will not collapse from the delay.\"\n\n\nShe glances at you. \"We should bring extra cloaks for her—it will be colder on the plateau than here in the valley. And something to eat that she can manage on horseback. Bread, cheese, perhaps some of those dried apricots she has decided are her favorite this week.\"\n\n\nLucia pauses, then adds with dry amusement: \"She will also inform us, very loudly, when she wishes to switch horses.

No crown, no chains of office. Today you are simply a man taking his family north.\n\n\nHidalgo is waiting in the courtyard, breath steaming in the cold morning air. The great destrier stamps and tosses his head when he sees you, eager for the road after too many weeks of stable rest. You run a hand along his neck, feeling the powerful muscles beneath the winter coat, and swing up into the saddle.\n\n\nThe escort is assembled—forty men-at-arms in neat formation, their horses' tack jingling softly as they shift in the cold. Captain Fernán sits at their head, having insisted on commanding the escort personally despite the routine nature of the journey. \"The day I let someone else guard Your Majesty on the open road is the day I hang up my sword,\" he'd said, and that had been the end of the discussion.\n\n\nThe baggage train is modest: four packhorses carrying clothing, provisions, and Catalina's small mountain of necessary items. No wagons, no carriages. You could almost be a wealthy merchant's household setting out for a country estate, save for the armed men and the royal banner that snaps in the cold breeze.\n\n\nMinutes stretch on. From somewhere inside the Alcázar, you hear Catalina's voice raised in what sounds like either excitement or protest—difficult to tell at this distance.\n\n\nThen, at last, movement at the gate."

This is a Chaos Roll situation—random events on a journey—not a persuasion roll. The journey from Toledo to Madrid is routine (13 leagues, about 50-55 km, a single day's ride), with a royal escort of 40 men-at-arms, advance party already clearing the road, and traveling in December winter weather.\n\n\n\nD100 JOURNEY TABLE: Toledo to Madrid (December 1433)\n\n\nContext: 13 leagues (~55 km), single day's ride. Royal party includes King Juan, Queen Lucia, Princess Catalina (19 months), 40 men-at-arms, 2 Italian ladies-in-waiting, advance party of 12 already scouting. December weather on the Castilian plateau. Road is a well-traveled route between royal residences.\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nLarge armed escort (40 men + advance party)\n\nWell-maintained road between major towns\n\nShort distance (single day)\n\nExperienced riders, good horses\n\nAdvance party clearing route\n\n\nRisk Factors:\n\n\nWinter weather on exposed plateau\n\nTraveling with toddler\n\nDecember cold and potential storms\n\nBandits possible (though unlikely to attack 40 armed men)\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nSevere Weather Crisis. A sudden winter storm descends on the plateau—driving sleet, bitter wind, visibility dropping to nothing. The party must seek emergency shelter in a village or roadside inn, arriving cold, miserable, and delayed by a full day. Catalina catches a chill (minor illness, recovers in days).\n6-15\nDifficult Weather. Heavy grey skies, biting wind, intermittent freezing rain. Miserable riding conditions. Catalina fusses and cries for much of the journey, refusing comfort. Everyone arrives exhausted and cold, tempers frayed. No lasting harm but an unpleasant day.\n16-25\nMinor Delays. A horse throws a shoe, or a pack horse goes lame, or the road is muddy and slow in places. Arrival pushed to after dark. Catalina falls asleep mid-journey and is cranky when woken. Uneventful but tedious.\n26-45\nRoutine Journey. Cold but manageable December weather. Catalina alternates between horses as planned, naps once under heavy cloaks, eats her dried apricots, and arrives tired but content. Nothing remarkable—a successful family trip.\n46-65\nPleasant Journey. Crisp, clear winter day—cold but bright, with good visibility across the plateau. Catalina is delighted by everything, chattering happily, and behaves beautifully. The party makes good time, arriving before expected. A genuinely enjoyable ride.\n66-80\nMemorable Moment. Something small but charming happens: Catalina says a new word, or spots a hawk and is enchanted, or falls asleep in Lucia's arms in a way that moves everyone who sees it. The journey becomes a treasured family memory rather than mere travel.\n81-90\nUnexpected Encounter. The party meets someone of interest on the road—perhaps a merchant with news from the north, a minor noble traveling to Toledo who pays respects, or a group of pilgrims heading south. An opportunity for brief but meaningful interaction.\n91-95\nFirst Snow. Light snowfall begins as the party travels—Catalina's first real experience of snow. She is utterly enchanted, trying to catch flakes, squealing with delight. Lucia and Juan share the moment of watching their daughter discover winter. Arrives at Madrid with a light dusting of white on the landscape.\n96-100\nPerfect Day. Everything aligns: bright winter sun, crisp air, Catalina happy and well-behaved, easy pace, early arrival. The hunting lodge is warm and welcoming, fires already lit. The family settles in feeling genuinely relaxed for the first time in weeks. An auspicious start to the retreat.\n\n\nShall I roll?"

The air bites at exposed skin, but there is no wind to speak of, and the horses' breath rises in steady white plumes as they maintain an easy pace.\n\n\nCatalina proves an ideal travelling companion. She spends the first hour on Hidalgo with you, clutching his mane and providing commentary on everything she sees: \"Trees, Papá. Big trees.\" Then, imperiously: \"Birds.\" When a hawk circles overhead, she points with her riding crop and announces, \"That one.\" As if claiming it for her personal collection.\n\n\nBy mid-morning she demands transfer to Lucia, reaching out with grabbing hands until you pass her across. She settles against Lucia on Tormenta with a contented sigh, and within minutes is drowsing against her stepmother's chest, lulled by the rhythm of hoofbeats.\n\n\nYou stop briefly at a village well to water the horses. Catalina wakes, eats dried apricots with intense concentration, shares one with Donna Francesca (who accepts it gravely, as one receives a gift from royalty), and declares herself ready to ride with Papá again.\n\n\nThe plateau stretches around you—brown winter grass, scattered holm oaks, the distant blue suggestion of the Guadarrama mountains to the north. Captain Fernán's scouts report the road clear ahead. The men-at-arms ride in relaxed formation, some talking quietly among themselves.\n\n\nBy early afternoon, the modest towers of Madrid come into view—a small town climbing a gentle hill above the Manzanares River, the royal hunting lodge visible on its outskirts. You arrive with perhaps two hours of daylight remaining, Catalina still chattering happily about horses and birds and the \"big water\" of the river.\n\n\nThe lodge steward emerges to greet you, bowing deeply. Smoke rises from multiple chimneys—fires already lit, rooms prepared. The smell of roasting meat drifts from somewhere within.\n\n\nA genuinely enjoyable ride. A family, travelling together."

The Italian ladies sit at the far end of the table, speaking quietly in Ferrarese, while Captain Fernán takes his meal with the men-at-arms in an adjoining room.\n\n\nThe fire pops and settles. Outside, the December darkness has fallen completely, the windows showing nothing but black. Somewhere a dog barks, then falls silent.\n\n\n\"This is what I imagined,\" Lucia says quietly, watching Catalina attempt to stack pieces of bread into a tower. \"When you spoke of Madrid. Fewer people. Smaller rooms. Time to simply... be.\"\n\n\nCatalina's bread tower collapses. She looks at it with betrayal, then at you, clearly expecting you to fix this architectural disaster."

It falls immediately.\n\n\n\"No,\" she tells the cheese sternly.\n\n\nShe eats it instead, the lesson apparently learned.\n\n\nBy the time the meal winds down, Catalina's eyelids are growing heavy, her movements slower.

Her head begins to nod.\n\n\n\"Someone,\" Lucia observes quietly, \"has had a very long day on horseback.\"\n\n\nDonna Francesca rises, ready to take Catalina to the small chamber prepared for her, but pauses—looking to you and Lucia to see if you wish to put her to bed yourselves."

      "say": "A sensible request. Let me consider the relevant factors.\n\n\n\nD100 TABLE: Lucia's Conception (December 1433 - onward)\n\n\nContext: Juan (21) and Lucia (23) are both young and healthy. They married December 3, 1433, and are now in Madrid for a family retreat. No known fertility issues for either party. Lucia has never been pregnant before. Medieval understanding of conception is limited, but frequency of relations and general health matter. They are actively trying to conceive an heir—the succession situation makes a son urgent.\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nBoth young and healthy\n\nActive marriage (no indication of problems)\n\nStrong motivation (succession needs)\n\nReduced stress during Madrid retreat\n\nNo known fertility complications\n\n\nRisk Factors:\n\n\nLucia has never been pregnant (unknown fertility)\n\nFirst marriages sometimes take time\n\nMedieval pregnancy rates lower than modern due to nutrition, health factors\n\nRandom chance plays largest role\n\n\nHistorical Context: Medieval noble couples typically conceived within 1-2 years of marriage if both were fertile. Some conceived immediately; others took longer. Approximately 80-85% of healthy young couples would conceive within a year of regular relations.\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nDelayed Fertility. Despite regular relations, Lucia does not conceive through winter, spring, or summer 1434. No medical explanation—simply the uncertainty of nature. Conception possible in autumn 1434 or later. Court whispers begin, though quietly.\n11-25\nLate Summer 1434. Lucia conceives in July or August 1434. Pregnancy confirmed by early autumn. Child due spring 1435. A reasonable timeline, though the wait through spring and early summer brings some anxiety.\n26-45\nEarly Summer 1434. Lucia conceives in May or June 1434, likely around the time of or shortly after the Constantinople expedition. Pregnancy confirmed by mid-summer. Child due late winter/early spring 1435.\n46-65\nSpring 1434. Lucia conceives in March or April 1434. Pregnancy confirmed by late spring. Child due December 1434 or January 1435. A welcome timeline—news of pregnancy arrives as Juan prepares for Constantinople journey.\n66-80\nLate Winter 1434. Lucia conceives in February 1434. Pregnancy confirmed by early spring. Child due November or December 1434. The succession question begins to resolve itself relatively quickly.\n81-90\nEarly Winter 1434. Lucia conceives in January 1434, shortly after the Madrid retreat. Pregnancy confirmed by late February. Child due October 1434. Swift and reassuring for the kingdom.\n91-97\nImmediate Conception. Lucia conceives in December 1433—possibly during this very Madrid retreat. Pregnancy confirmed by late January 1434. Child due September 1434. Extraordinarily quick, a sign of blessing according to medieval understanding.\n98-100\nTwins. Lucia conceives immediately (December 1433) and carries twins—confirmed when she grows unusually large by spring. Due September 1434. High risk but potentially resolving succession questions dramatically. Medieval twin births are dangerous for mother and children alike.\n\n\nNote on Gender: A separate roll will determine the child's sex when birth approaches. Medieval couples had no control over this, and a daughter—while not resolving succession—would still demonstrate fertility and provide hope for future sons.\n\n\n\nShall I roll?"

By the time Juan departs for Constantinople in spring, he will know Lucia carries his child.\n\n\n\nThe Madrid retreat passes quietly. Days blur together in pleasant monotony: morning rides when the weather permits, Catalina's endless explorations of the lodge and its grounds, evenings by the fire with wine and conversation. The small household falls into easy rhythm—no ambassadors demanding audiences, no councils requiring decisions, no documents awaiting signature.\n\n\nLucia blooms in the informal setting, her Ferrarese wit sharpening without the weight of court ceremony. You catch her one afternoon teaching Catalina Italian words for animals, your daughter solemnly repeating \"cavallo\" and \"cane\" with varying degrees of accuracy.\n\n\nThe days grow shorter, then slowly begin to lengthen again. Christmas comes and goes, celebrated simply in Madrid's small church. The new year arrives—1434, the year that will see you sail to Constantinople, the year your second child will be born.\n\n\nBy mid-January, you must think of returning to Toledo. The kingdom awaits. The Constantinople expedition requires planning. The world will not hold still forever, even for kings who wish it would.\n\n\nBut for now—for these few weeks—you are simply a man with his wife and daughter, in a small house, watching the fire burn low.\n\n\n\nIs there anything specific you wish to do during the Madrid retreat before returning to Toledo?"

To be brave when she is tired.\"\n\n\nShe considers this for a long moment. Then, with the decisive confidence of a general accepting a commission: \"Catalina brave.\"\n\n\n\nOver the following days, you establish a routine. Each morning, weather permitting, Catalina rides with you or Lucia—short circuits around the lodge at first, then gradually longer excursions along the roads and paths near Madrid. She learns to grip the mane properly, to lean into turns, to anticipate the horse's movements.\n\n\nShe falls asleep in the saddle twice and nearly slips once—caught easily, but it teaches her that holding tight is not merely a suggestion. After that, her small fists clutch with genuine determination.\n\n\n\"Tight,\" she mutters to herself as she rides. \"Hold tight.\"\n\n\nBy the second week, she can manage an hour without complaint. By the third, nearly two—though she grows restless toward the end and requires distraction. Lucia proves skilled at this, pointing out birds, inventing games, singing fragments of Italian songs that Catalina attempts to mimic with enthusiastic inaccuracy.\n\n\nOne afternoon, Catalina looks up at you from Hidalgo's back, her cheeks red from cold, her dark curls escaping from beneath her cap.\n\n\n\"Papá,\" she says. \"Catalina... good rider?\""

Now she considers, her expression thoughtful.\n\n\n\"Two very different women,\" she says slowly. \"Leonor has the heart. She knew Isabel, loved her, can speak of her to Catalina with warmth and memory. She is gentle, and gentleness matters with children.\" She pauses. \"But Maria has the stomach—literally. A sea voyage to Constantinople is not a pleasure cruise down the Tagus. If Leonor spends the journey green-faced and miserable, she will be of little use to anyone, no matter how pure her intentions.\"\n\n\nShe glances at the two women, then back to you. \"Maria is also right that chasing a twenty-month-old across a ship requires a certain... stubbornness. Catalina is sweet, but she is also fast, curious, and entirely without fear. Leonor might lose her overboard while composing a sonnet about the sunset.\"\n\n\nA hint of a smile crosses her face, softening the words. \"But there is something to be said for what Leonor offers. Catalina will have plenty of practical women around her—myself, Francesca, Isabella, the nursemaid. What she may lack is someone who can speak of Isabel with love, not just duty. Someone who can tell her stories of her mother as a person, not just a queen.\"\n\n\nShe turns to you fully. \"If I must choose? Leonor. We can tie her to the mast if she gets seasick.\" The dry Ferrarese humor surfaces. \"But I would hear your thoughts, husband. This is your daughter's heritage we are preserving.\""

A nursemaid expects this. A lady-in-waiting...\" She pauses diplomatically. \"It is not the same. Soiled linens, the washing, the endless small tasks that are beneath a noblewoman's station but must be done regardless.\"\n\n\nShe looks at Doña Maria directly. \"I mean no offense. You are clearly competent and willing. But would you scrub a child's soiled clothes? Would you rise three times in a night without complaint? Would you accept being, in essence, a servant rather than a companion?\"\n\n\nThe question hangs in the air—practical, perhaps uncomfortable, but necessary. The distinction between a lady-in-waiting and a nursemaid is not merely one of tasks, but of station. To ask a Portuguese noblewoman to perform a servant's duties could be seen as an insult to her family, her country, her honor.\n\n\nLucia turns back to you. \"If Maria is willing to blur that line—truly willing, not merely saying what she thinks we wish to hear—then yes, perhaps we can manage without a separate nursemaid.

The carriage rumbles alongside, Lucia visible through the window, the guards trailing behind.\n\n\nA family, traveling together. Testing the roads that will carry them across kingdoms."

The wind has reddened her cheeks and her cap has slipped back again, dark curls escaping in all directions.\n\n\n\"Catalina ride,\" she repeats slowly, working through the plan. \"Then sleep in box. Then ride again?\"\n\n\n\"Yes. Ride, then rest, then ride again. For many days.\"\n\n\nShe frowns, the concept of \"many days\" still somewhat abstract to her nearly-two-year-old mind. But the immediate logic seems to satisfy her.\n\n\n\"No bouncing in box,\" she adds, with the solemnity of someone who has learned an important lesson. She pats her stomach meaningfully. \"Bouncing bad.\"\n\n\n\"No bouncing in the box,\" you agree.\n\n\nShe nods, the matter settled. Then she twists to look at the carriage, where Lucia is still watching. She waves, and Lucia waves back.\n\n\n\"Lucia-mama sleep in box too?\"\n\n\n\"Sometimes. Or Lucia-mama might ride her horse. Or sit with you in the box while you sleep.\"\n\n\nCatalina considers the full picture: horses, carriage, Papá, Lucia-mama, many days of travel, no bouncing. It is, perhaps, the most complex logistical arrangement she has ever been asked to contemplate.\n\n\nFinally, she nods again, more decisively this time.\n\n\n\"Catalina can do,\" she announces. Then, with a hint of her earlier imperiousness: \"Catalina brave. Papá said.\""

The first time you don the full harness, the weight feels unfamiliar—not unbearable, but no longer the second skin it once was. You spend hours over the following weeks reacquainting yourself with its constraints: the limited vision of the helm, the way the gorget restricts your neck, the particular balance required to mount Hidalgo in full plate.\n\n\nBy the second week, the old rhythms begin to return. By the third, you can move without thinking about the steel encasing you.\n\n\n\nThe morning of departure dawns cold and grey, a thin frost coating the courtyard stones. The column is assembling beyond the gates—the carriage, the escort, the packhorses laden with provisions and baggage. Donna Francesca, Donna Isabella, and Doña Leonor wait with the other ladies, their breath misting in the chill air.\n\n\nBut first, the nursery.\n\n\nFernando lies in his cradle, awake but calm, his dark eyes tracking the movement of a cloth rabbit that Doña Beatriz dangles above him. At four months, he has grown considerably—his cheeks have filled out, his limbs grown sturdy. He makes small sounds of contentment as the rabbit dances.\n\n\nWhen you approach, his gaze shifts to you. There is recognition there, you think—or perhaps only the instinctive attention an infant pays to faces. He does not smile yet, not truly, but his expression softens.\n\n\nDoña Beatriz steps back, giving you space.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" she says quietly. \"He has been fed and changed. He will sleep soon.\"\n\n\nYou look down at your son—this small life you are leaving behind for months, trusting to others' care while you sail to the edge of Christendom."

His dark eyes, so like Isabel's, hold yours for a long moment.\n\n\nThen his eyelids grow heavy, the rabbit forgotten, and he begins to drift toward sleep. The journey to Constantinople means nothing to him. He knows only warmth, milk, the familiar faces that appear above his cradle. The world beyond this room does not yet exist.\n\n\nDoña Beatriz curtseys, her eyes glistening slightly. \"I will guard him with my life, Your Majesty. When you return, he will be sitting up, perhaps. Reaching for things. Growing into the prince he will become.\"\n\n\nShe hesitates, then adds more softly: \"Queen Isabel... she would be proud of what you are doing. Sailing to defend Christendom. Taking Catalina to see the world.\" A pause. \"I will tell him stories of his father while you are gone. So he knows your voice when you return, even if he cannot remember why.\"\n\n\nFrom somewhere beyond the nursery, you hear Catalina's voice—imperious, excited, demanding to know why the horses are not moving yet. Lucia's calm reply is too quiet to make out.\n\n\nThe column waits. Constantinople waits. The future waits.\n\n\nBut for this moment, there is only a sleeping infant, a faithful guardian, and the weight of leaving."

Diego's tax collectors grow bolder by the week.\" A hint of dry humor. \"I will try not to let everything collapse in your absence.\"\n\n\nHe clasps your arm—a rare gesture of familiarity from a man who guards propriety carefully. \"Bring Constantinople our steel.

Catalina is in Doña Leonor's arms, bundled against the cold, her small riding crop already clutched in one hand.\n\n\n\"Papá!\" She strains toward you, nearly launching herself from Leonor's grasp. \"Catalina ready! We go now!\"\n\n\nYou lean down from the saddle. \"Horse with Papá, horse with Lucia-mama, or the cosy box?\"\n\n\nShe considers her options with exaggerated seriousness, looking from you to Lucia to the carriage. The moment stretches.\n\n\n\"Papá,\" she decides firmly, reaching up. \"Catalina start with Papá.\""

Fernando?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, exactly like that. Aunt María is to Papá what Fernando is to you.\"\n\n\nShe nods, satisfied with this explanation.\n\n\n\"After Barcelona, we go on a ship. A great wooden vessel that floats on the water—bigger than any boat you have seen. It will carry us across the sea to Rome.\"\n\n\n\"Big water,\" Catalina says, her eyes widening.\n\n\n\"Very big water. And Rome is where Lucia-mama comes from. Her home, before she came to Castile to be your Lucia-mama.\"\n\n\nCatalina twists to look at Lucia on Tormenta. \"Lucia-mama's home?\"\n\n\nLucia smiles. \"Where I grew up, tesoro.

The banner of Castile snaps in the winter wind, crimson and gold against the grey sky.\n\n\nThe gates of Toledo pass on either side, the guards saluting as you ride through. Citizens line the streets despite the early hour and the cold, drawn by word that the king departs for distant Constantinople. Some cheer. Some cross themselves. A few call out blessings: \"Dios le guarde, Majestad!\" and \"Viva el Rey!\"\n\n\nCatalina waves her riding crop at them imperiously, apparently believing this response is directed at her. Given that she is a princess of Castile riding to the edge of Christendom at not-yet-two years old, perhaps she is not entirely wrong.\n\n\nThe road stretches north and east—toward Aragón, toward Barcelona, toward the sea. Toward Rome and the Pope, toward Constantinople and the Ottoman guns, toward whatever God has written for the King of Castile and his remarkable daughter.\n\n\nThe column settles into its rhythm.

The winter sun climbs higher, pale but bright.\n\n\nThe journey has begun.\n\n\n\nEnd of Chapter 2.14 Opening\n\n\nShall we continue with the journey to Barcelona, or would you like to pause here for a chapter summary?"
