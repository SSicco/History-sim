Hi, 

This is chapter 2.18. I am on my way to Rome to get me and my family settled in. I plan to do a few things before I am recieved by the pope.

Reconstructed narrative context and prepared scene setup















Now I have the full context. Let me set the scene for Chapter 2.18.

CHAPTER 2.18
Rome: Preparations and Audiences
March 22-23, 1434

The summons arrived by the hand of a young papal secretary in black cassock—parchment bearing the seal of the Fisherman's Ring, requesting His Most Catholic Majesty Juan II of Castile present himself at the Apostolic Palace on the morrow, the twenty-third day of March, at the hour of Terce.

Three days you have waited in the Palazzo di San Marco, watching Rome from its upper galleries. The city sprawls before you, eternal and fractured—the dome of the old Pantheon visible beyond a tangle of medieval towers, the Tiber brown with spring runoff curving through neighborhoods that once housed emperors and now shelter weavers and butchers. Somewhere beyond the rooftops, the half-finished hulk of St. Peter's awaits, and the man who claims to speak for God on earth.

Your household has found its rhythm in the palazzo. Queen Lucia rests often—the pregnancy progresses well, but sea voyages are no friend to women with child, and the first trimester's sickness has not entirely passed. Catalina, now two years old and possessed of boundless energy, has made a conquest of the palazzo's courtyard, where she commands a battalion of imaginary soldiers from atop an overturned wine cask while Doña Leonor watches with the patient exhaustion of all who attend small children.

The 591 knights of your expedition are encamped at San Paolo fuori le Mura, the great basilica outside the walls where the Apostle Paul lies buried. Captain Fernán has reported daily: morale is recovering from the Mistral disaster that cost you 75 souls, but the men are restless. They came to fight Turks, not to wait in monastery gardens.

The morning is yours before the audience.

What do you wish to accomplish?

You skipped ahead to the morning of the audience. I dont want that. We are in the moment we arrive in Rome and are being ferried by river barge to the city.

Repositioned narrative to immerse player upon arrival



You're right—my apologies. Let me begin properly.

CHAPTER 2.18
Rome: The Eternal City
March 18, 1434

The Tiber runs brown with spring melt, swollen and sluggish, carrying your barge past marshes thick with reeds and the ruins of ancient aqueducts that stride across the landscape like the bones of giants. The oarsmen work in steady rhythm, their calls echoing across the water as Rome rises slowly from the flatlands ahead.

Your fleet anchored at Ostia this morning after three days from Cagliari—a mercy, given the Mistral disaster of March 7th that cost you 75 souls and scattered your formation across half the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Princesa Catalina weathered the storm, though barely. Now ten ships rest in the harbor while river barges ferry your household upriver to the city.

Lucia sits beside you on cushions arranged against the barge's low gunwale, her hand resting on her belly where your second child grows. The pregnancy is perhaps three months along now—early enough that travel remains possible, late enough that the sickness has begun to ease. She watches the approaching city with the quiet attention of someone returning to familiar territory after long absence.

Catalina—two years old, imperious, and entirely unimpressed by ancient capitals—has claimed the bow of the barge as her personal domain, where Doña Leonor prevents her from leaning too far over the water while the child points at every passing bird and demands to know its name.

The first domes and towers of Rome appear through the river haze. You can make out the bulk of Castel Sant'Angelo, the old mausoleum of Hadrian converted to papal fortress, its round mass dominating the river approach. Beyond it, the jumble of medieval construction rises—churches, towers, the crumbling shells of ancient temples repurposed as markets and stables.

Captain Fernán stands near the stern, conferring quietly with the barge master about landing arrangements. The 591 knights who survived the storm will march overland from Ostia tomorrow, but tonight the household must be settled.

The barge rounds a bend, and Rome spreads before you in full.

Read the project files and consult all the decrees passed by the council of basel. Especially after the declaration of como and the result this had on the council. (See chapter 2.17)

I have instructed my delegation to maintain communication with me about developments. It has been some time since I have left them. What messages have I recieved from them? What do I know?

5 dec 2025

Synthesized council decrees and delegation communications regarding Basel developments











The river bends again, and you let your mind turn to the leather satchel that sits beside Captain Fernán at the stern—the accumulated correspondence of months, couriers finding you at Cagliari, at Barcelona, at every port and relay station where your fleet paused.

The Castilian delegation has written faithfully, as you instructed. Abbott Rodrigo's letters arrive in his cramped, scholarly hand; Bishop Alfonso's in the elegant script of a trained diplomat. Since September, Fray Hernando has been with you rather than at Basel, but the others have maintained the flow of intelligence.

What you know from your delegation's reports:

The Autumn of Reform (September-October 1433)

The Declaration of Como had the effect you hoped. When Emperor Sigismund arrived at Basel in late June with your joint declaration in hand, the moderate faction found their spine. The French extremists under Cardinal d'Allemand continued to push for papal deposition, but the German pragmatists and your Castilian delegation formed a working coalition.

Three major reform decrees passed in rapid succession:

Session 15 (September 14, 1433): Clerical Concubinage — A graduated penalty system for priests keeping women. Warning for first offense, suspension for second, deprivation for third. Your delegation reports that Bishop Alfonso spoke powerfully in favor, citing Granada's newly-conquered churches as places where reform must begin fresh rather than inherit old corruptions.

Session 16 (September 28, 1433): Pluralism — No cleric may hold multiple benefices with cure of souls. Cardinals limited to one bishopric. The critical innovation: dispensations now granted by local ordinaries, not Rome, and only for three narrow causes. This closes the loophole that destroyed every previous anti-pluralism decree. Abbott Rodrigo writes with evident satisfaction that the decree follows the Como principle exactly—grandfather existing lawful arrangements, reform going forward.

Session 17 (October 19, 1433): Annates Reform — Papal taxation of benefices reduced by seventy-five percent, but not abolished entirely. Abbott Rodrigo emphasizes this distinction in three separate letters. The historical Council of Basel, he warns, made the catastrophic error of eliminating annates completely with no replacement revenue—financially destroying the papacy and guaranteeing schism. This decree preserves a papal revenue stream while adding transparency and accountability. Something Pope Eugenius might actually accept as "parallel legislation."

The Bohemian Peace (November 1433)

The news that made Abbott Rodrigo weep, by his own admission.

On November 30, 1433, the Council of Basel and the Kingdom of Bohemia signed the Compacts of Basel—a bilateral treaty ending thirty-five years of religious war. Not a decree imposed by victors, but a negotiated peace between equals. The Hussites received communion in both kinds, their central demand. The Church preserved doctrinal integrity through the doctrine of concomitance. Five crusades failed to achieve what dialogue accomplished in months.

Bishop Alfonso writes that Prokop the Great, the Taborite commander who defeated those five crusades, refused to sign. The radical wing rejects compromise. But the moderate Utraquists—the majority—have accepted peace.

Emperor Sigismund, after seventeen years of war, will finally receive the Bohemian crown.

Your delegation understood the significance immediately. Abbott Rodrigo's letter reads: "If the Council can end the Hussite Wars through words rather than swords, Your Majesty's vision of parallel legislation becomes not merely hopeful but proven. What was accomplished for Bohemia can be accomplished for the universal Church."

The Crusade Decree (December 14, 1433)

This is the matter closest to your heart, and the news is... mixed.

Session 19 passed the Decree for the Defense of Constantinople with extraordinary conciliar support. Abbott Rodrigo reports the vote was nearly unanimous—a remarkable achievement given Basel's usual factional paralysis.

But the details reveal both triumph and limitation:

What the decree achieves:

Constantinople explicitly named as THE singular objective
Sultan Murad II identified by name as the adversary
Wall repair specifically mentioned as primary goal
Concrete timeline: forces to assemble by summer 1434
Crusade financing mechanisms established through metropolitan structures and Florentine banks
What the decree lacks:

Only two concrete military commitments: Castile (your thousand knights and sixty thousand florins, already pledged before the decree) and the Knights of St. John
No other Christian prince has committed forces
No designated supreme military commander
No resolution of the Greek schism question—the decree neither demands union as a precondition nor calls the Orthodox "brothers," simply referring to "Christians in peril"
No termination clause defining when the crusade ends
Bishop Alfonso's assessment is blunt: "The decree is, in essence, an ecclesiastical endorsement of Your Majesty's personal crusade, dressed in the language of pan-Christian mobilization. You will receive the Council's blessing and the legitimacy of conciliar authority. You will not receive significant military reinforcement from other kingdoms."

The termination problem particularly concerns you. The decree states forces shall remain "until the walls are repaired and the Empire can restore its own forces." But the Byzantine treasury is empty. Their military has been collapsing for decades. That condition could remain unfulfilled indefinitely.

Current Council Dynamics (as of January-February 1434)

Abbott Rodrigo's most recent letter, which reached you at Barcelona, describes a council exhausted by its own success. The reform decrees are passed. The Bohemian peace is signed. The crusade is proclaimed. Now the French faction pushes again for the constitutional question—whether councils stand above popes.

Cardinal Cesarini walks a knife's edge, trying to prevent Cardinal d'Allemand from forcing a vote on papal supremacy that would rupture any possibility of cooperation with Eugenius.

Fray Hernando—no longer at Basel, but with you on this voyage—has been replaced in the delegation by other Castilian clergy. Your delegation remains, in Abbott Rodrigo's words, "the moderate faction's best friend—respected by Germans, tolerated by French, trusted by Cesarini."

But the old abbot is seventy-three years old, and his letters have grown shorter. Bishop Alfonso carries more of the burden now.

The barge passes beneath a crumbling Roman bridge—ancient stonework supporting medieval wooden repairs. Ahead, the bulk of Castel Sant'Angelo grows larger.

You carry all this in your satchel, and in your mind. The question is what you will do with it when you stand before Pope Eugenius IV.

I ask Fray Hernando what concomitance actually means. 

Also, explain to me what loophole has now been closed regarding plurality. 

And finally, can the council of Basel now conclude? What is left for them to discuss?

5 dec 2025

Synthesized theological doctrine, institutional reform, and unresolved conciliar tensions






Fray Hernando sits across from you on the barge, his grey Franciscan habit travel-worn but clean. The journey from Barcelona has restored some color to his cheeks—he is no longer the exhausted man who worked through the night drafting the Declaration of Como, though the lines around his eyes have deepened.

He considers your question with the careful attention he gives to all matters of doctrine.

"Concomitance," he says, "is the teaching that Christ is wholly present—body, blood, soul, and divinity—under each species of the Eucharist. When you receive the bread alone, you receive the entire Christ. When you receive the wine alone, you receive the entire Christ. The two species are not two halves of a whole."

He watches Catalina at the bow, still demanding bird names from the patient Doña Leonor, before continuing.

"This matters for Bohemia because it allowed the Council to grant the Hussites what they wanted—communion in both kinds—without admitting that the rest of Christendom has been receiving an incomplete sacrament for centuries. The Bohemians get their chalice. The Church maintains that those who receive bread alone are not deprived of anything. Both sides preserve their dignity." A slight smile. "Theological face-saving, Your Majesty. The Council has become skilled at it."

On the question of pluralism, Fray Hernando's expression sharpens.

"The loophole was simple, and it destroyed every previous reform. The Fourth Lateran Council prohibited pluralism in 1215. The prohibition lasted perhaps a decade before it became meaningless. Why?" He holds up a finger. "Because Rome could grant dispensations. A bishop holds three dioceses? Forbidden by canon law—unless the Pope grants a dispensation. And dispensations were always granted, for the right price or the right connections."

He spreads his hands. "Every anti-pluralism decree for two hundred years has been undermined the same way. The law says 'no,' but the Pope says 'yes, for you, this once'—and 'this once' becomes always, for everyone who matters."

"The Basel decree closes this by removing dispensations from Rome entirely. Now only the local ordinary—the bishop—can grant dispensation, and only for three narrow causes: two tiny benefices that together barely feed a man, benefices annexed by ancient right, or university professors who need support while teaching. That is all. Cardinals, archbishops, papal favorites—none of them can receive dispensation from Rome, because Rome no longer grants them."

He pauses. "And the grandfathering provision is clever. Those who currently hold multiple benefices lawfully, with existing dispensations, may keep them for life. But when they die, the arrangement dies with them. No renewal, no inheritance, no perpetuation. The abuse ends naturally, without requiring mass deprivations that would create chaos."

Your third question makes him sigh.

"Can the Council conclude? In principle, yes. The stated purposes—ending the Bohemian heresy, reforming the Church in head and members—have been substantially addressed. The Hussites are reconciled. The reform decrees are passed. The crusade is proclaimed."

He looks toward Rome, now visible as a jumble of towers and domes beyond the Castel Sant'Angelo.

"But the Council will not conclude, Your Majesty, because the real question was never Bohemia or reform. The real question is Haec Sancta—the decree of Constance that declared councils superior to popes. Cardinal d'Allemand and the French faction came to Basel to finish what Constance started. They want a permanent constitutional settlement that places the papacy under conciliar authority forever."

Fray Hernando's voice drops. "They have been patient. They supported the reform decrees because reform strengthens the Council's legitimacy. They supported the Bohemian peace because success proves the Council's necessity. They supported the crusade decree because it demonstrates the Council can act where popes cannot. But all of this, for them, is preparation for the final battle."

"Eugenius has not accepted the reform decrees as papal legislation. He has not endorsed the Compacts. He tolerates Basel because he cannot suppress it, but he has not surrendered his claims. The French faction will eventually force a vote on supremacy—whether the Pope must obey the Council or the Council must obey the Pope. When that vote comes..."

He trails off, watching a flock of starlings wheel above the riverbank.

"When that vote comes, Your Majesty, everything we have built may shatter. The reform decrees become weapons in a constitutional war rather than foundations for a renewed Church. The Bohemian peace becomes a precedent for councils overruling popes on doctrine. The crusade becomes a sideshow while Rome and Basel tear each other apart."

The barge rounds a final bend. The Castel Sant'Angelo looms directly ahead now, its massive cylinder reflected in the brown water.

"So no. The Council cannot conclude. Not until someone wins. Or until someone finds a way for both sides to stop fighting without either side admitting defeat."

He looks at you directly.

"Which is, I believe, why you insisted on coming to Rome before Constantinople. And why you carry the Declaration of Como in your satchel."

But if the radicals force a vote on authority and they cannot get it passed? Or if someone passes another vote in favor of papal authority, will that not end the council? Anyway, who or what determines when the council concludes? Is that a vote as well?

5 dec 2025

Examined Council's procedural mechanics and constitutional dissolution pathways




Fray Hernando tilts his head, appreciating the precision of your questions.

"You think like a king, Your Majesty. You see a problem and ask: how do we end it? But councils do not work like kingdoms."

He shifts on the cushions, finding a more comfortable position as the barge rocks gently.

"If the radicals force a vote and lose—say, Cardinal d'Allemand demands a decree declaring councils perpetually superior to popes, and the German moderates vote it down—what happens?" He shrugs. "Nothing. The radicals remain at Basel. They continue attending sessions. They wait. They try again in six months, or a year, when circumstances favor them. A lost vote is a delay, not a defeat."

"And if someone proposed a decree affirming papal authority?" He actually laughs, a short bark without much humor. "The French faction would never allow it to reach a vote. They would raise procedural objections. They would demand it be referred to the deputation of faith for study. They would walk out and hold their own session, declaring the other session illegitimate. Basel operates by consensus of the four deputations—faith, peace, reform, and common affairs. Any faction with enough votes in even one deputation can obstruct almost anything."

He leans forward, warming to the topic as scholars do.

"As for who determines when the Council concludes—this is the constitutional question that has no settled answer. Three possibilities exist in theory."

He raises one finger. "First: the Pope dissolves the Council. Pope Eugenius tried this in December 1431, immediately after his election. He issued the bull Quoniam alto, commanding the Council to disperse and reconvene at Bologna in eighteen months." Fray Hernando's expression is dry. "The Council refused. They declared that a legitimately assembled council cannot be dissolved, transferred, or prorogued by the Pope without conciliar consent. They continued meeting as if the bull did not exist. Eugenius eventually had to rescind his dissolution and recognize the Council's legitimacy, because he could not enforce his command."

A second finger. "Second: the Council votes to dissolve itself. This requires agreement across all four deputations—a consensus that the Council's work is complete. In principle, possible. In practice..." He gestures vaguely toward the city ahead. "Who decides when 'reform of the Church in head and members' is complete? The French faction will say reform is incomplete until papal supremacy is broken. The moderates will say reform is complete when the decrees are passed. They will never agree."

A third finger. "Third: Pope and Council agree jointly to conclude. This is what happened at Constance—the Council ended by mutual consent after resolving the schism. But Constance ended because both sides wanted it to end. Martin V was elected, the schism was healed, everyone was exhausted. Basel is different. Neither side wants to end it on the other's terms."

He drops his hand and looks at you with something like sympathy.

"You are asking whether there is a mechanism to simply stop the conflict. There is not. The Council continues until one side wins decisively, or until both sides exhaust themselves into irrelevance, or until some external force—invasion, plague, the death of key figures—changes the calculus entirely."

The barge passes into the shadow of the Castel Sant'Angelo. Above you, papal guards watch from the battlements.

"Constance lasted four years and ended in triumph. The Council of Basel has already sat for three years with no end in sight. It could continue for another decade. It could still be meeting when Catalina is grown."

Lucia, who has been listening quietly while resting against the cushions, speaks for the first time.

"Then what is the point of the parallel legislation Juan carries? If neither side will yield, what does it accomplish?"

Fray Hernando turns to her with evident respect. "An excellent question, Your Majesty. The parallel legislation does not end the conflict. It... routes around it. If Pope Eugenius adopts the reform decrees on his own authority—the same text, issued as papal legislation—then the substance of reform is achieved regardless of who wins the constitutional war. The Church is reformed whether councils rule popes or popes rule councils."

He pauses. "The French faction would hate this, of course. They want reform to prove conciliar supremacy. If the Pope simply adopts the reforms himself, their victory becomes hollow. They reformed the Church... and gained nothing from it."

"Which is precisely why they may try to prevent parallel legislation from succeeding. And why your audience with Eugenius matters so much, Your Majesty."

The barge bumps gently against a wooden dock. Roman porters wait to receive you, and beyond them, the eternal city sprawls in the afternoon light.

The council of constance was in 1415. And Frequens required a new council be held after 5 years. Why did Martin wait so long before be called for Basel? Should he not have summoned council in 1420?

5 dec 2025

Reconciled historical discrepancy between decree requirements and papal compliance










Fray Hernando's eyebrows rise—the expression of a teacher pleased by a student's attentiveness.

"You have read Frequens, Your Majesty. Good." He holds up a hand as the porters begin to bustle around the barge. "But you have the dates slightly wrong, and the history is more complicated than simple papal defiance."

He counts on his fingers as the barge is secured to the dock.

"Constance opened in 1414 and closed in 1418, after electing Martin V. Frequens was passed in 1417, requiring councils at intervals of five years, then seven, then every ten years thereafter. So: a council in 1423, another in 1430, then 1440, 1450, and so on into perpetuity."

"Martin did summon a council for 1423, as required. It met at Pavia."

He grimaces. "It was a disaster. Poorly attended—most bishops found excuses not to come. Then plague broke out in Pavia, and the council transferred to Siena. More plague. More empty seats. The French were fighting among themselves and sent almost no one. The Germans were distracted by Hussite wars. The Spanish kingdoms were consumed by their own quarrels."

The porters have laid a gangplank. Fray Hernando remains seated, finishing his explanation.

"Martin dissolved the Council of Pavia-Siena in 1424, having accomplished almost nothing. He was not defying Frequens—he had called the council as required. But a council that no one attends is merely an empty room with candles."

He stands slowly, stretching muscles stiff from the river journey.

"The next council was due seven years later—1430 or 1431. Martin called it for Basel, to open in March 1431. He chose Basel precisely because it was convenient to the Germans, hoping for better attendance than Pavia. And because the Hussite question had grown desperate—five crusades had failed, and someone had to negotiate with the Bohemians."

"But Martin died in February 1431, weeks before the council opened. His successor, Eugenius IV, inherited a council he did not summon, in a city he did not choose, to address problems he had not created."

Fray Hernando steps onto the gangplank, then pauses to look back at you.

"Eugenius tried to dissolve Basel immediately, as I mentioned. The council refused. And here we are, three years later, with Pope and Council still at war over who commands whom."

He offers a thin smile. "So you see, Your Majesty—Martin did not ignore Frequens. He complied with the letter of the law. But compliance and success are not the same thing. Pavia-Siena proved that you can summon a council and still accomplish nothing. Basel is proving that a council can accomplish much and still tear the Church apart."

Lucia has risen carefully, one hand on her belly, and Captain Fernán moves to assist her onto the dock. Catalina is already ashore, tugging at Doña Leonor's hand and pointing at a Roman soldier's plumed helmet.

"The question," Fray Hernando continues quietly, as you prepare to disembark, "is whether anyone learned anything from Pavia's failure. Or whether we are doomed to repeat it, with higher stakes and sharper knives."

How strong is the Frensh faction in the council? Do they really control so much votes?

5 dec 2025

Weighed French faction's influence against council's structural constraints






Fray Hernando pauses on the dock, letting the porters handle the baggage while he considers your question. The Roman afternoon sun catches the grey in his tonsured hair.

"Strong enough to obstruct. Not strong enough to command." He folds his hands into his sleeves. "But the Council's structure makes obstruction almost as powerful as command."

He glances around, ensuring no Roman clergy are within earshot—papal territory demands discretion when discussing conciliar politics.

"You must understand how Basel votes, Your Majesty. It is unlike any parliament or cortes you have seen. The Council does not vote by nation, as Constance did. It does not vote by rank—bishops over abbots over doctors. Instead, it operates through the four deputations: faith, peace, reform, and common affairs. Every member of the Council is assigned to one deputation. Every deputation must approve a measure before it reaches the general session. And within each deputation, a simple majority carries the vote."

He steps aside as porters carry a trunk past him.

"This means that every priest, every abbot, every doctor of theology has the same vote as a cardinal or archbishop. A Franciscan friar from Lyon counts equally with the Archbishop of Trier."

"Now consider what this means for the French faction."

Fray Hernando's voice takes on the precise cadence of a man who has spent eight months watching these dynamics unfold.

"Cardinal d'Allemand does not command a majority of the Council. If you counted heads across all four deputations, the moderates—Germans, Castilians, some Italians, the Emperor's supporters—likely outnumber the French radicals. This is why the reform decrees passed. This is why the Bohemian peace was achieved. On matters of genuine reform, the moderates can assemble enough votes."

"But Cardinal d'Allemand does not need a majority to obstruct. He needs only to control one deputation sufficiently to prevent measures from reaching the general session. And he needs allies willing to use procedural tactics—demanding referrals, raising objections, questioning credentials, walking out to deny quorum."

He counts on his fingers again. "The French have perhaps sixty to eighty committed supporters. The University of Paris sends a steady stream of doctors who vote as d'Allemand directs. French bishops and abbots follow their cardinal. Some Burgundians align with them, though Burgundy's politics are complex. A scattering of radical conciliarists from other nations who genuinely believe councils must rule popes."

"Against them, the Germans number perhaps one hundred to one hundred twenty, but they are divided between Sigismund's loyalists, who want cooperation with Rome, and those who simply want reform regardless of constitutional questions. The Italians are few—most Italian clergy stay close to Rome rather than traveling to Basel. The Spanish delegations—Castile, Aragon, Portugal—are small but respected. The English send almost no one; they are consumed by their French wars."

"So when you ask how strong the French faction is..."

Fray Hernando spreads his hands.

"They cannot pass a decree of papal deposition over moderate opposition. They tried to force this issue in 1432, before the Declaration of Como, and failed. The Germans would not support it."

"But they can prevent any decree that favors papal authority. They can block attempts to conclude the Council. They can ensure that every session becomes a battlefield over procedure and precedent. They can make Basel so hostile to Eugenius that he refuses to cooperate with any conciliar legislation, even reforms he might otherwise accept."

He looks toward the city, toward the Vatican visible in the distance.

"And there is a deeper problem, Your Majesty. The moderates grow weary. Bishop Alfonso writes that attendance has declined since the great decrees passed. Men who came to Basel for reform have achieved reform; they wish to go home to their dioceses. Men who came for the Bohemian peace have achieved peace; they see no reason to remain."

"But the French radicals do not go home. They stay. They wait. They attend every session while others drift away. And as the moderates leave, the radicals become proportionally stronger."

Fray Hernando's expression is grim.

"Time favors Cardinal d'Allemand, Your Majesty. Every month that passes without resolution, his faction grows stronger relative to those who remain. If this continues another two or three years, he may yet command the majority he currently lacks."

Lucia has reached the dock now, Catalina pulling at her hand impatiently. The child has discovered a street vendor selling roasted nuts and is making her desires known with characteristic volume.

"This is why parallel legislation matters," Fray Hernando concludes quietly. "If Eugenius adopts the reforms now, while the moderates still hold Basel, the substance is secured regardless of what happens later. If he waits, hoping the Council will collapse on its own... he may wait too long."

What realistic strategy could we develop to end the council? 

If for example, Eugenius signs the decrees Basel has already passed and rallies a strong Italian attendance to go to Basel, would we then have the votes to end the council? They would arrive carrying the legislations passed by the pope and would start voting to end the council since no further issues exist. Could this work?

5 dec 2025

Weighed papal strategy's procedural obstacles and political vulnerabilities









Fray Hernando stops walking. The Roman street bustles around you—porters, merchants, a Franciscan brother hurrying past with a basket of bread—but he stands still, studying you with an expression you recognize. It is the look he gives when you have said something that requires genuine thought rather than ready answers.

"You are proposing to flood the Council," he says slowly. "To change its composition so dramatically that the French faction becomes a minority even with their current numbers unchanged."

He gestures for you to step aside, into the shade of a crumbling Roman archway, away from the bustle of the dock. Captain Fernán keeps the porters moving while Lucia waits with Catalina and the ladies, understanding that this conversation requires privacy.

"Let me think through this with you, Your Majesty. The strategy has... merit. But also difficulties."

"First, the mechanics."

He leans against the ancient stonework, arms folded.

"New arrivals at Basel are assigned to deputations by the Council's administrative officers. In theory, this is done to balance the deputations. In practice, it is political. If one hundred Italian clergy arrive at once, all known to favor dissolution, the officers—who include French sympathizers—could scatter them across all four deputations, diluting their impact. Or they could delay seating them while 'verifying credentials,' which can take months. Or they could assign them all to the deputation of common affairs, which handles administrative matters but rarely touches constitutional questions."

He holds up a hand before you can respond.

"This is not insurmountable. If Eugenius coordinates with Cardinal Cesarini, who still holds significant influence as papal legate, the assignments could be managed. But it requires preparation and allies within the Council's administration."

"Second, the perception."

Fray Hernando's expression grows more troubled.

"If one hundred Italian clergy arrive in Basel carrying papal legislation, and immediately begin voting to conclude the Council, what will Cardinal d'Allemand say?"

He answers his own question, his voice taking on a mocking French accent.

"'The Pope has sent his lackeys to suppress legitimate reform! These are not independent prelates seeking the good of the Church—they are Roman agents doing Roman bidding! Their votes should not count because they did not come to deliberate, but to execute a predetermined command!'"

His voice returns to normal. "And here is the problem, Your Majesty: he would not be entirely wrong. If the Italians arrive with the obvious purpose of ending the Council, their legitimacy is tainted. The moderates—the Germans who have worked for genuine reform—might not support a dissolution that looks like papal manipulation. They want the Council to end honorably, not to be strangled by Roman hands."

"Third, the walkout."

Fray Hernando pushes off from the wall, pacing in the small shaded space.

"Suppose your strategy succeeds. Suppose the Italians are seated, the votes are counted, and the Council of Basel votes to dissolve itself. What prevents Cardinal d'Allemand from simply... refusing to leave?"

He stops, facing you.

"The French faction could declare the dissolution vote illegitimate. They could claim the Italian newcomers were not properly credentialed, or that the vote violated procedural requirements, or that a council cannot dissolve itself while reform remains incomplete. They could continue meeting—a rump council, perhaps, but a council nonetheless. They ignored Eugenius's dissolution in 1431. Why would they accept a dissolution orchestrated by his Italian supporters?"

"You would have two bodies claiming to be the legitimate Council of Basel. One dissolved, one continuing. The schism you seek to prevent would occur anyway, merely in different form."

"And fourth..."

Fray Hernando's voice softens.

"Would Eugenius actually do this? Would he sign the Basel decrees?"

He glances toward the Vatican, visible over the rooftops.

"By signing, he acknowledges that Basel has passed legitimate legislation. He validates the Council's authority. Some of his advisors will argue he should never concede this—that he should wait for Basel to collapse under its own contradictions rather than dignifying it with papal endorsement."

"The annates decree alone reduces papal revenue by seventy-five percent. The pluralism decree strips Rome of the power to grant dispensations. These are not small concessions, Your Majesty. You are asking Eugenius to sign away powers his predecessors accumulated over centuries, and to do so in coordination with a council that has declared itself his superior."

He falls silent for a moment, watching a cat pick its way along the ancient stones.

"And yet..."

Fray Hernando turns back to you.

"The core of your strategy is sound. You understand that the Council ends when there is nothing left to fight over. If Eugenius adopts the reforms, the reform grievance disappears. If the Bohemian peace holds, that grievance disappears. If Constantinople is defended, the crusade grievance disappears. What remains? Only the constitutional question—whether councils rule popes."

"And the constitutional question, by itself, is not enough to sustain Basel indefinitely. Men came to Basel for reform, for Bohemia, for crusade. If those are achieved, attendance will decline. The French faction cannot maintain a council alone. They need moderates present to give their proceedings legitimacy."

He strokes his chin thoughtfully.

"A wiser strategy, perhaps, would be slower. Not a flood, but a tide. Eugenius signs the decrees—not because Basel demands it, but because reform is good and right. This removes the accusation that he opposes reform. Over months, Italian attendance increases—not dramatically, but steadily. The moderates, seeing reform achieved and papal cooperation offered, begin to argue that the Council's work is complete. The French find themselves increasingly isolated, defending a constitutional war that no one else wishes to fight."

"The Council does not end by dramatic vote. It ends by... exhaustion. By irrelevance. By men going home because there is nothing left to do. Cardinal d'Allemand can continue meeting with his French doctors if he wishes, but if no one else attends, he is merely an old man talking to himself in an empty cathedral."

Fray Hernando meets your eyes.

"This is slower than you would like, Your Majesty. It could take two years, perhaps three. But it ends the Council without creating a schism, without validating the charge of papal manipulation, and without giving the French a martyrdom to rally around."

He pauses.

"Of course, this assumes Eugenius is willing to play a long game. And that nothing happens in the meantime to inflame passions further. And that you are willing to remain involved in church politics for years rather than months."

A wry smile crosses his face.

"Which, I suspect, is precisely what the Declaration of Como committed you to. Whether you fully understood that at the time."

I have always been worried by the mechanism of the council. That they operate on a principle of giving a vote to whoever decides to show up. This seems unfair to faithful far removed from Basel and opens up for what the Frensh are doing; flooding the council with doctors from Paris who vote as a bloc. I have always considered that the council if left to very few attendants could pass critical legislation with full legitimacy. But you seem to say that a council with very few members have no legitimacy. But would the decrees they pass not have the full weight of haec sancta?

Excavated the paradox between procedural and political legitimacy in conciliar governance






Fray Hernando's expression shifts—the look of a teacher who has been waiting for a student to reach precisely this question.

"Now you have found the wound at the heart of conciliarism, Your Majesty."

He settles against the archway again, clearly prepared for a longer discussion. Lucia catches his eye and nods slightly, guiding Catalina toward the shade of a nearby fountain where the child can splash her fingers in the water while the adults talk.

"Let me answer your question with another question," Fray Hernando says. "What gives Haec Sancta its authority?"

He does not wait for you to respond.

"The decree claims that a general council, legitimately assembled in the Holy Spirit, representing the universal Church, holds authority directly from Christ—authority that even the Pope must obey in matters of faith, schism, and reform. This is the foundation of everything Basel claims."

"But consider: Haec Sancta was passed at Constance in 1415 by perhaps three hundred prelates, in the midst of a schism when three men claimed to be Pope and none commanded universal obedience. Was that assembly 'representing the universal Church'? The Greeks were not present. The Russians were not present. Most of Africa and Asia were not present. Spain was barely represented. Even within the Latin West, many bishops refused to attend because they did not recognize the council's legitimacy."

He spreads his hands. "Yet we treat Haec Sancta as binding. Why? Because enough of Christendom accepted it as binding. Because it resolved the schism. Because Martin V was elected under its authority and ruled as Pope for ten years without repudiating it directly. Legitimacy came not from the mechanism, but from the acceptance."

"Now apply this to your question."

Fray Hernando's voice takes on a harder edge.

"You are correct that Basel's mechanism is absurd. A doctor of theology from Paris, who holds no pastoral responsibility, who shepherds no flock, who answers to no one but his university faculty, has the same vote as the Archbishop of Toledo, who governs a province of two million souls. A wandering friar can arrive in Basel, claim credentials, and vote on matters affecting the entire Church. The system practically invites manipulation."

"And you are also correct that a council reduced to a handful of attendees could, procedurally, pass any decree it wished. Fifty French doctors could vote tomorrow to depose Eugenius, elect a new Pope, and declare themselves the supreme authority in Christendom. The mechanism permits it."

He pauses, letting the implications settle.

"But would anyone obey?"

"This is the distinction you are grasping toward, Your Majesty. There is procedural legitimacy—following the rules as written—and there is actual legitimacy—the acceptance of Christendom that makes decrees effective."

"The decrees Basel has passed so far carry weight because they were passed by a broadly-attended council with German, Castilian, Italian, English, and yes, French participation. The Compacts of Basel ended the Hussite Wars because Bohemia and the Empire and the moderate council fathers all accepted them. The reform decrees have moral force because they address genuine abuses that the whole Church acknowledges."

"But a decree passed by fifty Frenchmen in an empty cathedral? The Archbishop of Toledo would ignore it. The German princes would ignore it. The Italian bishops would laugh at it. Even if Cardinal d'Allemand waved Haec Sancta and screamed that councils are supreme, no one would care. A council that claims to represent the universal Church but manifestly does not... is merely a collection of men with opinions."

Fray Hernando pushes off from the wall and steps closer, lowering his voice.

"This is the trap the French faction has set for themselves, Your Majesty. They exploit the mechanism—flooding Basel with Parisian doctors, maintaining attendance while others leave, using procedures to obstruct and delay. But every manipulation undermines the legitimacy they claim to defend."

"When Cardinal d'Allemand packs the deputations with university theologians who have never governed a parish, he weakens the Council's claim to represent the Church. When the French faction remains while the Germans and Italians and Spaniards depart, they transform Basel from a general council into a French conventicle. They may retain procedural control, but they lose the moral authority that made Haec Sancta powerful in the first place."

He shakes his head slowly.

"The French do not see this. Or perhaps they see it and do not care. They believe that if they can pass decrees claiming authority, the authority becomes real. They confuse the words with the substance."

"And here is the deepest irony."

Fray Hernando's smile is thin and bitter.

"Pope Eugenius makes the same error in reverse. He believes that if he simply denies the Council's authority, it has none. He issues bulls declaring Basel dissolved, and when Basel continues meeting, he pretends this is mere rebellion that will eventually collapse. He refuses to engage with the reform decrees because engaging would acknowledge the Council's right to pass them."

"But denial does not make Basel disappear. The reform decrees exist. The Bohemian peace exists. The crusade decree exists. Bishops across Christendom read these documents and ask: 'Are these laws? Must I obey them?' And Eugenius has no answer except 'No, because I say no.'"

"Which is precisely as weak as Cardinal d'Allemand saying 'Yes, because I say yes.'"

He falls silent for a long moment, watching Catalina splash in the fountain while Doña Leonor tries to prevent her from soaking her dress entirely.

"You asked about a strategy to end the Council, Your Majesty. The true answer is this: the Council ends when both Pope and Council stop pretending that legitimacy flows from their own declarations."

"If Eugenius signs the reform decrees, he acknowledges that councils can do good work—but as parallel legislation, adopted by papal authority, not conceded to conciliar supremacy. He gains the moral high ground of reform while denying that he was compelled to reform."

"If the Council, in turn, accepts that its reforms have been adopted and its work is complete, it acknowledges that papal cooperation was necessary to make reform effective. It gains the substance of what it sought while quietly abandoning the claim that it could command the Pope."

"Both sides yield something. Both sides gain something. Neither side admits defeat."

Fray Hernando meets your eyes.

"This is what the Declaration of Como proposed, Your Majesty. This is what you must persuade Eugenius to accept. Not because it is philosophically pure—it is not. But because it is the only path that does not end in schism."

He glances toward the Vatican.

"Whether the Pope is wise enough to see this... that is what we are about to discover."

The legislation on annates says that half of annates go to the apostolic camera and half to the archbishops? What is the purpose of both institutions?

5 dec 2025

Examined institutional roles and financial purposes of papal and metropolitan structures






Fray Hernando nods, clearly pleased that you are attending to the financial mechanisms rather than merely the political principles.

"Two different treasuries serving two different purposes, Your Majesty. And the decree's division between them is one of its most significant—and controversial—innovations."

He gestures for you to walk with him toward the fountain where Lucia waits, speaking as you move through the Roman street.

"The Apostolic Camera—the Camera Apostolica—is the papal treasury. The central financial institution of the Roman Church."

"It funds everything the papacy does. The cardinals and their households. The papal curia—hundreds of secretaries, notaries, lawyers, scribes who administer Church affairs across Christendom. Diplomatic missions to every Christian court. The papal armies that defend the Papal States from condottieri and ambitious princes. Building projects—you will see scaffolding on St. Peter's when we reach the Vatican; it has been under construction for decades and will be for decades more."

He sidesteps a cart laden with wine barrels.

"The Camera also funds papal charity—hospitals, alms for the poor, ransoming of Christian captives from Muslim pirates. And it supports the papal household itself: the servants, the guards, the cooks, the physicians, the artists who glorify God through their work in Rome."

"All of this costs money. Enormous sums. The annates, along with other revenues—the Papal States' taxes, fees for dispensations and indulgences, Peter's Pence from England, crusade tithes—flow into the Camera to fund these operations."

"Now consider what happens when Basel reduces annates by seventy-five percent."

Fray Hernando's voice carries a note of grim practicality.

"The Camera's income collapses. Cardinals must reduce their households. Diplomatic missions are curtailed. Building projects halt. Papal armies shrink—which means the Papal States become vulnerable to anyone with a few hundred mercenaries and ambition."

"This is why I told you the historical Basel made a catastrophic error when they abolished annates entirely with no replacement. They did not merely reform the Church; they financially destroyed the institution that administered it. A Pope who cannot pay his servants cannot govern. A Pope who cannot defend his territories becomes a prisoner of whoever controls Rome."

He glances at you. "The decree you carry is wiser. It reduces the Camera's income severely, but it does not eliminate it. The Pope retains something. He can still function, though more modestly. This is reform, not destruction."

"The metropolitans are a different matter entirely."

You have reached the fountain. Lucia rises carefully, one hand on her belly, while Doña Leonor surrenders Catalina to a nursemaid's care. Fray Hernando lowers his voice as your party prepares to continue toward your lodgings.

"A metropolitan archbishop presides over an ecclesiastical province—a collection of dioceses. The Archbishop of Toledo, for instance, is metropolitan over the suffragan bishops of Palencia, Segovia, Osma, Sigüenza, Cuenca, and others. The Archbishop of Tarragona holds the same authority over the Catalan and Aragonese dioceses."

"Traditionally, the metropolitan's role is supervisory. He confirms the election of bishops in his province. He hears appeals from diocesan courts. He convenes provincial synods to coordinate policy. He visits dioceses to ensure discipline is maintained."

"But metropolitans have been... weakened, Your Majesty. Over centuries, Rome has drawn authority upward. Appeals skip the metropolitan and go directly to Rome. Papal legates override provincial synods. Bishops seek confirmation from the Pope rather than their metropolitan. The institution remains, but hollowed out."

"The annates decree reverses this."

Fray Hernando's eyes are sharp now, the eyes of a man who has thought carefully about institutional structures.

"By directing half of annates revenues to the metropolitan rather than Rome, the decree gives metropolitans resources. Money to convene synods. Money to conduct visitations. Money to support poorer dioceses in their province. Money to maintain provincial administration."

"And resources mean power. A metropolitan with a full treasury can actually do the supervision he is supposed to do. He becomes a meaningful check on bishops who abuse their office. He becomes an alternative to appealing everything to Rome, which is slow and expensive and favors those who can afford Roman lawyers."

He pauses at a corner, orienting himself toward your lodgings.

"This is decentralization, Your Majesty. Power flowing from Rome back to the provinces. The French faction supports this because it weakens the papacy. The German moderates support this because they believe provincial churches should govern themselves more. The reform-minded support this because metropolitans on the ground can address abuses faster than distant Rome."

"But consider the implications for parallel legislation."

Fray Hernando's voice drops further.

"If Eugenius signs this decree as papal legislation, he is not merely reducing his own income. He is empowering potential rivals. Every metropolitan in Christendom becomes richer and more independent. Every provincial synod becomes more significant. The Church becomes less Roman and more... distributed."

"Some in the Curia will argue this is surrender. That Eugenius is dismantling the very institution he leads. That future Popes will curse his name for giving away powers that took centuries to accumulate."

He shrugs.

"Others will argue that a Church with stronger provinces is a healthier Church. That Rome tried to control everything and failed—corruption flourished precisely because distant oversight is ineffective. That metropolitans who can actually supervise their provinces will produce better bishops, better priests, better pastoral care."

Lucia has taken your arm as you walk. She speaks quietly. "And what do you believe, Fray Hernando?"

The Franciscan is silent for several steps.

"I believe, Your Majesty, that the Church of the Apostles had no Camera Apostolica and no centralized treasury. Peter did not levy annates. Paul did not dispatch legates to override local bishops. The early Church was communities—Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Rome—each governing itself, coordinating through councils when needed, united in faith rather than administration."

"Whether we can return to something like that without chaos... I do not know. But I know the current system is breaking. The question is whether it breaks through reform or through schism."

He gestures ahead to a modest palazzo flying Castilian colors—your lodgings, arranged in advance.

"Perhaps, Your Majesty, the question for Eugenius is not whether he wishes to share power with the metropolitans. Perhaps the question is whether he prefers to share it willingly, and retain some voice in how it is shared... or to have it torn from him by a council that despises him."

I want to speak with the apostolic camera and I also want to gage how the pope feels about these reforms. Before I am meeting him. I want to test the waters. Any idea who to speak to?

5 dec 2025

Identified key contacts for financial and political intelligence gathering





Fray Hernando exchanges a glance with Lucia as your party approaches the palazzo. The question has shifted from theology to practical politics—and Lucia, daughter of a Florentine banking family, may have insights the Franciscan lacks.

"Two different inquiries requiring two different approaches," Fray Hernando says slowly. "The Camera is an institution. The Pope's feelings are... more delicate."

Lucia speaks before he can continue. "May I, husband?"

You nod.

"The Apostolic Camera is managed by the Camerlengo—the Chamberlain of the Holy Roman Church. Currently this is Cardinal François de Conzié." Lucia's voice carries the quiet confidence of someone who grew up hearing banking discussed at table. "But the Camerlengo is a political appointment, close to the Pope. He will tell you nothing Eugenius does not wish you to hear."

She guides you around a puddle of questionable origin.

"Below the Camerlengo sits the Treasurer, and below him the clerks and auditors who actually manage the accounts. These men are bureaucrats, not politicians. They know exactly how much the Camera receives, from what sources, and what happens if those sources diminish."

"My family has dealt with Camera officials for decades. The Medici bank handles much of the papal finances—transfers, currency exchange, loans against future revenues." A thin smile. "If you wish to understand what the annates reform would actually do to papal finances, you do not ask the Camerlengo. You ask a senior clerk who has spent thirty years balancing the ledgers."

Fray Hernando nods slowly. "Can you arrange such a meeting, Your Majesty?"

Lucia considers. "I can write to our family's Roman agent. The Medici maintain a permanent representative here precisely because papal finances are so significant. He will know which Camera officials might speak candidly to a sympathetic ear—and which would report every word directly to the Camerlengo."

She pauses. "But this must be handled delicately. If it appears that the King of Castile is investigating papal finances before his audience, Eugenius will hear of it within hours. The Vatican leaks like a Roman aqueduct."

"As for gauging the Pope's feelings..."

Fray Hernando picks up the thread as you reach the palazzo's entrance. A Castilian servant opens the door, bowing deeply.

"You met Cardinal Giordano Orsini when you first came to Rome, Your Majesty. He was Martin's closest advisor, spoke fluent Castilian, and assessed your character before your audience with the dying Pope."

"I remember." The memory is vivid—Orsini's probing questions, his consultation with Fray Hernando, his evident surprise at finding genuine faith rather than political calculation.

"Orsini remains influential, but his position has changed. He was Martin's man. Eugenius is a Venetian—Gabriel Condulmer was his name before elevation—and he brought his own circle of advisors. The Orsini family and the Venetian faction are not enemies, but neither are they natural allies."

Fray Hernando follows you into the cool interior of the palazzo.

"Still, Orsini knows the Vatican better than almost anyone alive. He survived the transition from Martin to Eugenius. He understands the currents. And he remembers you favorably—your humility before Martin made an impression that he wrote about to Spanish bishops."

"There is another possibility," Lucia adds, settling carefully into a chair as servants bustle to prepare refreshments. Catalina has already discovered a courtyard with orange trees and is demanding to pick fruit.

"Cardinal Domenico Capranica."

Fray Hernando's eyebrows rise. "The papal legate? He returned to Rome after the crusade, but—"

"But he saw Granada, Fray Hernando. He witnessed what my husband accomplished. He examined the converted qadi and was moved to tears by the evidence of genuine faith." Lucia accepts a cup of watered wine from a servant. "When we last saw him, he had transformed from a procedural bureaucrat into a genuine supporter of the crusade's spiritual mission."

She looks at you. "Capranica is not Eugenius's closest confidant, but he has the Pope's ear. And he has seen what you can do. He can speak to Eugenius about your character from personal experience, not rumor."

"Moreover," she continues, "Capranica cares about proper procedure—canonical correctness, as you may recall from Toledo." A slight edge enters her voice at the memory of the cardinal's demands regarding her Portuguese ladies. "If you wish to know how Eugenius views the Basel decrees, ask Capranica how Rome interprets their canonical status. He will tell you whether the Vatican considers them legitimate legislation requiring response, or mere pretensions to be ignored."

Fray Hernando has been thinking while Lucia spoke.

"There is a risk in all of this, Your Majesty. Every conversation you have before the audience will be reported. Every question you ask reveals your intentions. If you inquire too closely about Camera finances, Eugenius will know you are preparing arguments about annates reform. If you probe too obviously about his feelings toward Basel, he will know you come as the Council's advocate."

He sits across from you, accepting his own cup of wine.

"Perhaps the wiser approach is to let others make inquiries on your behalf. Queen Lucia's family connections can explore the financial questions without your direct involvement. Cardinal Capranica might be approached by... someone from your household, expressing the King's gratitude for his service during the crusade and inquiring whether His Eminence might spare time for a private conversation."

"And Cardinal Orsini..." Fray Hernando pauses. "I could visit him. One Franciscan calling upon a cardinal who once interviewed him about his king's spiritual state. A pastoral conversation, not a political one. I can listen to what he says—and what he does not say—without committing you to any position."

He sets down his cup.

"The question is what you wish to learn, Your Majesty, and how much you are willing to reveal in the learning. Every inquiry is a signal. What signal do you wish to send before you stand before the Pope?"

Regarding the camera: I want to learn if there is a silver lining in these reforms on annates. The church has grown far and wide. Large. If all annates everywhere would be collected correctly and with full authority, would they maybe not lose as much revenue? The scisms must have impacted church and papal revenue right? I want to see if I can make the case that this reform actually is in the interest of Rome. 

Regarding the pope himself, I want to find out if he rejects the reforms outright or is he is open for dialogue and what his position on paralell legislation actually is. 

If my person would indeed attract unwanted attention, maybe my queen and confessor could inquire on my behalf?

Strategized diplomatic inquiries through trusted intermediaries regarding reform benefits




Lucia leans forward, her eyes brightening with the particular interest she shows when conversation turns to matters of finance and trade.

"Now you are thinking like a Medici, husband."

She sets down her cup, her hands moving as she speaks—a habit, you have noticed, when her mind works quickly.

"The argument you are constructing is sound in principle. Let me explain what I know, and what we would need to confirm."

"The Great Schism lasted nearly forty years—1378 to 1417. For most of that time, two popes claimed authority, sometimes three. Each commanded obedience from different kingdoms. France followed Avignon. England, the Empire, and most of Italy followed Rome. Castile shifted allegiance multiple times. Portugal changed sides. Aragon changed sides."

She ticks off fingers. "Now consider what this meant for annates. A bishop in Toulouse paid his annates to Avignon. A bishop in Milan paid to Rome. But a bishop in a contested region—Catalonia, for instance, or Navarre—might pay to neither, claiming uncertainty about legitimate authority. Or he might pay a reduced sum, pleading poverty while pocketing the difference. Who would enforce collection when two rival Cameras each claimed jurisdiction?"

Fray Hernando nods slowly. "I remember the chaos. Benefices were sometimes filled by both popes simultaneously—two men claiming the same bishopric, each with credentials from a different Rome. The lawsuits lasted decades."

"And the revenues," Lucia continues, "were devastated. My grandfather spoke of it. The Medici began their rise precisely because someone had to manage the financial chaos. Papal debts accumulated. The Camera borrowed against future revenues at ruinous interest. When Martin V finally reunited the papacy, he inherited a treasury that was functionally bankrupt."

"Now consider the present situation."

Lucia rises and moves to a window, looking out at the Roman street.

"The schism is healed, but its effects linger. Collection mechanisms were disrupted for forty years. In distant provinces—Scandinavia, Poland, the edges of Christendom—the habit of paying annates fully and promptly was broken. Local bishops grew accustomed to retaining revenues that should have flowed to Rome. Metropolitan archbishops began treating certain incomes as their own by custom, regardless of canon law."

"My family's agents report that actual annates collection runs perhaps sixty to seventy percent of what canonical requirements demand. Some regions pay faithfully. Others pay partially. Others pay only when a papal legate arrives with threats of interdict—and even then, they negotiate reductions."

She turns back to face you.

"If the reform decree establishes clear rates, transparent accounting, and shared collection between Camera and metropolitans... the metropolitans have incentive to collect fully, because half goes to them. Currently they have no incentive—they are merely Rome's tax collectors, resented by their suffragans and unrewarded for their trouble."

Fray Hernando strokes his chin thoughtfully.

"You are suggesting that twenty-five percent of revenues actually collected might equal or exceed one hundred percent of revenues theoretically owed but practically uncollectable."

"I am suggesting it is possible," Lucia replies carefully. "I do not know the Camera's actual books. No one outside the Camera does—which is itself part of the problem the decree addresses. But the logic is sound. A smaller share of a larger, reliably-collected sum may exceed a larger share of a sum that exists only on parchment."

She returns to her seat. "This is the inquiry I would make through our family's agent. Not 'will the Pope accept reform'—that is political. But 'what are actual collection rates across Christendom, and how do they compare to canonical requirements?' The Camera clerks know these numbers. They have watched revenues fluctuate for decades. They understand the gap between theory and practice."

"And," she adds, "they are bureaucrats. They may privately welcome a reform that makes their work easier. Currently they must chase bishops who claim poverty, dispute assessments based on century-old valuations, and fight endless legal battles over contested benefices. A simpler system with metropolitan cooperation might appeal to men who have spent careers wrestling with the current chaos."

Fray Hernando shifts the conversation.

"For the Pope's own disposition, I can approach Cardinal Orsini. But I must be careful about what I ask."

He stands, pacing slowly as he thinks aloud.

"If I ask directly, 'Does Eugenius accept the Basel decrees?', Orsini will give me the official position—rejection, dismissal, the claim that Basel has no authority. This tells us nothing we do not already know."

"But if I ask differently..." He pauses. "If I speak of the King of Castile's sincere desire to serve Holy Mother Church. If I mention that His Majesty carries proposals from Como, developed with Emperor Sigismund, that might offer a path to peace. If I wonder aloud whether His Holiness might receive such proposals as genuine attempts at reconciliation rather than conciliar demands..."

"Then Orsini's response—his tone, his hesitations, his choice of words—will tell me much. Does he dismiss the very idea? Does he express private sympathy? Does he suggest which arguments might resonate and which would offend?"

Fray Hernando stops pacing.

"Orsini is old and has served the Church for fifty years. He remembers what the schism cost. He knows that another rupture could be worse. If there is any opening in Eugenius's position—any willingness to discuss rather than merely denounce—Orsini will know. And I believe he will tell me, because he remembers that I told him the truth about you four years ago, and events have proven me right."

"There is also Cardinal Capranica," Lucia adds. "I could call upon him myself. A queen expressing gratitude for his service during the crusade, inquiring after his health, perhaps mentioning that her husband hopes to continue the good work Capranica witnessed in Granada..."

She smiles slightly. "Capranica is a canon lawyer. He cannot resist discussing canonical questions. If I express innocent confusion—'My husband speaks of something called parallel legislation, but I confess I do not understand what this means. Could Your Eminence explain?'—he will explain. At length. And in explaining, he will reveal how the Vatican understands the concept. Whether they see it as a possible solution or a conciliar trap."

Fray Hernando looks at Lucia with evident respect. "You have done this before, Your Majesty."

"I am a Florentine married to a Spanish king, living through a papal-conciliar crisis while pregnant with my second child." Her voice is dry. "I have learned that information flows more freely when powerful men believe they are educating a curious woman rather than negotiating with an adversary."

The afternoon light slants through the palazzo windows. Somewhere in the courtyard, Catalina is singing a nonsense song to an orange she has managed to pick.

"So," Fray Hernando summarizes. "Queen Lucia approaches the Medici agent regarding Camera finances, seeking the practical reality of annates collection. She also calls upon Cardinal Capranica to discuss canonical questions with appropriate feminine curiosity. I visit Cardinal Orsini as a Franciscan concerned for Church unity, listening for any opening in the papal position."

He looks at you. "And you, Your Majesty, remain above these preliminary inquiries. You rest from your voyage. You attend to your daughter. You are seen visiting Roman churches as a pilgrim, not a politician. When you stand before Eugenius, you come with clean hands—your household has made no demands, offered no threats, revealed no strategies."

"Whatever we learn, we share with you before the audience. And then you will know better what arguments might move this Pope, and which would only harden his resistance."

He pauses.

"Does this approach suit you, Your Majesty? Or would you proceed differently?"

GM: Lucia is pregnant for the first time.

Absorbed corrections, internalized NPC mechanics, prepared encounter framework


You're right—I apologize for the error. Lucia carries her first child, conceived in January 1434, due in October. Let me read the guides you've referenced.


Reconciled character details and architected NPC motivations for encounter resolution









Thank you for the corrections. Lucia is pregnant for the first time, due October 1434.

Now, let me draft the d100 table for Lucia's inquiry about Camera finances.

LUCIA'S CAMERA INQUIRY: D100 TABLE
The Approach: Queen Lucia, through her family's Roman banking agent, seeks to learn actual annates collection rates across Christendom—specifically whether reduced rates with better compliance might yield comparable or greater revenue than the current system of high rates with poor collection.

Success Factors (pushing toward higher results)
Medici banking connections: The family handles papal finances; their agent has legitimate access to Camera officials
Financial rather than political framing: Asking about numbers, not theology or authority
Lucia's status as Queen: Opens doors that would be closed to lesser figures
Genuine banking expertise: She can speak the language of ledgers and understand what she hears
No direct royal involvement: Juan is not personally making the inquiry
Failure Factors (pushing toward lower results)
Institutional self-protection: Camera officials have every reason to hide embarrassing collection failures
Political sensitivity: Any information could become ammunition in papal-conciliar war
Medici agent's own interests: He profits from current chaos; simpler systems might reduce his business
Foreigner and woman: Even a queen faces limits in Vatican financial circles
Timing: Everyone knows Juan is in Rome seeking papal audience; any inquiry looks strategic
Camera loyalty to Pope: Officials who reveal weaknesses might be seen as traitors to Eugenius
D100 TABLE: LUCIA'S CAMERA INQUIRY
Roll	Outcome
1-10	Doors Close. The Medici agent refuses to make inquiries. He values his relationship with the Camera more than Florentine family connections. He explains nothing—simply says it cannot be done and changes the subject. Lucia learns nothing except that the Vatican is more guarded than she expected.
11-25	Polite Evasion. The agent arranges a meeting with a junior Camera clerk who speaks in generalities. "Collection varies by province, Your Majesty. Some pay faithfully, others less so. I could not give you figures." The clerk is pleasant but reveals nothing of substance. Lucia senses fear beneath the courtesy.
26-40	Official Position Only. A mid-level Camera official agrees to meet but delivers only the institutional line: collection is adequate, rates are just, reform is unnecessary. He treats the inquiry as a test of loyalty and performs accordingly. Lucia learns what the Camera wants people to believe, not what is true.
41-55	Fragments and Hints. Through careful conversation, Lucia pieces together implications rather than facts. A clerk mentions that "certain provinces" have been "difficult" since the schism. Another references "ancient assessments" that "no longer reflect reality." She gains a sense that the problem exists but no concrete numbers.
56-70	One Honest Voice. An aging clerk, perhaps near retirement with less to lose, speaks more freely—though still cautiously. He confirms that actual collection runs "perhaps two-thirds" of canonical requirements in good years, less in bad. He will not name specific provinces or give written documentation. He asks that his name never be mentioned.
71-85	The Ledger Glimpse. Through a combination of Medici pressure and careful cultivation, Lucia gains access to summary figures—not the full accounts, but enough to confirm the gap between theory and practice. Collection rates vary from 90% in Italy to perhaps 40% in distant provinces. The schism's disruption is documented. She has something concrete to work with.
86-95	A Sympathetic Expert. A senior Camera auditor, privately frustrated with the current system's inefficiencies, agrees to an extended private conversation. He explains the collection problems in detail: valuations centuries out of date, no enforcement mechanism for distant provinces, corruption in the collection chain. He believes reform could improve actual revenues but will not say so publicly. He wants something in return—perhaps Castilian support for his advancement, or assurance his name stays protected.
96-100	The Hidden Reformer. Lucia discovers that someone within the Camera has already prepared analysis showing that reduced rates with metropolitan cooperation could maintain or exceed current actual revenues. This person has been waiting for someone powerful enough to carry the argument to the Pope. They are willing to share their work—but only if Lucia can guarantee their protection from retaliation. A potential ally, but one who demands much.
Roll when ready, Your Majesty.

Shall I also draft tables for Fray Hernando's approach to Cardinal Orsini and Lucia's conversation with Cardinal Capranica?

Orchestrated evasive NPC encounter with competing motivations













Polite Evasion
The afternoon shadows lengthen across the palazzo courtyard. Catalina has been put down for her nap—a battle, by all accounts, involving three nursemaids and a promised story about horses—and the household has settled into the quiet rhythms of a Roman siesta.

Lucia returns from her errand looking composed but thoughtful. She finds you in the small study the palazzo's owner has provided, removes her light traveling cloak, and settles into a chair across from you with the careful movements of early pregnancy.

"The Medici agent is named Francesco Bardi," she begins without preamble. "A cousin of my mother's, third removed. He was... accommodating. Up to a point."

She accepts a cup of watered wine from a servant, waits until the door closes.

"He arranged a meeting with a clerk from the Camera. A young man—perhaps twenty-five, dressed well but not expensively. The kind of man who hopes to rise but has not yet risen."

What Lucia Learned:

"The clerk was pleasant. Eager to help, he said. Very honored to meet a queen of such distinguished family." Her voice carries a note of dry amusement. "He spoke for perhaps half an hour. I learned nothing."

She sets down her cup.

"When I asked about collection rates, he said they 'vary by province, as Your Majesty would expect.' When I asked how they vary, he said 'some pay more faithfully than others.' When I asked which provinces pay less faithfully, he said he 'could not speak to specific regions without consulting records he did not have to hand.'"

"When I asked about the schism's impact on collection mechanisms, he said 'the Church has faced many challenges and overcome them through faith.' When I pressed for whether current collection matches canonical requirements, he said 'the Camera works diligently to fulfill its sacred responsibilities.'"

Lucia's expression sharpens.

"He was not rude. He was not hostile. He answered every question I asked. And he told me nothing."

What Lucia Sensed:

"There was fear beneath it, husband. Not fear of me—I am a pregnant Florentine woman asking about ledgers. Fear of something else."

She rises and moves to the window, looking out at the Roman afternoon.

"When I mentioned the Basel reforms—casually, as if making conversation—his face went still. Just for a moment. Then he smiled and said he 'could not comment on matters before the Holy Father.' But in that moment, I saw it. He knows the reforms would affect the Camera. He has opinions about them. And he will die before sharing those opinions with a foreign queen whose husband is about to meet the Pope."

She turns back to face you.

"Francesco was little better. He made the meeting happen, but he did not press when the clerk evaded. He did not offer to arrange a more senior contact. When I asked if there was someone else who might speak more freely, he said 'the Camera is a careful institution, cousin. They do not share their difficulties with outsiders.'"

Lucia's Assessment:

"Two possibilities. Either the Camera's finances are healthy and they simply guard their information from habit. Or the finances are troubled and they guard their information from shame."

She returns to her seat, folding her hands over her belly.

"I believe it is the second. A clerk with good news would have shared it. 'Collection is strong, Your Majesty. The Holy Father's treasury is sound.' Instead, he gave me fog. Men give fog when they have something to hide."

"But I cannot prove it. I have no numbers, no documents, no testimony I could present to anyone. Only the impression that a young man was very carefully saying nothing while appearing to say something."

She meets your eyes.

"If you wish to make the argument that reform could actually improve papal revenues, you will need evidence I could not obtain. Perhaps Fray Hernando will have better fortune with Cardinal Orsini. Perhaps Capranica will be more forthcoming with me tomorrow."

A pause.

"Or perhaps the Vatican keeps its secrets better than Barcelona's merchant guilds."

The bells of a nearby church begin to ring for None—the ninth hour of the day. Somewhere in the palazzo, Catalina wakes from her nap and begins demanding attention with characteristic volume.

Fray Hernando is expected to return from his visit to Cardinal Orsini before evening.

Even if finances are stressed, having reliable income streams are better than inclome streams that are big in theory but in practice vary wildly. If I were pope I would want a steady and predictable income stream. Makes it easier to budget as well.

5 dec 2025

Weighed character motivations against player logic, crafted nuanced NPC response






Lucia tilts her head, considering your words.

"You think like a merchant, husband. Or a king who must pay armies." A faint smile. "Predictable income, reliable planning, no surprises when the bills come due. Yes. This is wisdom."

She pauses, and the smile fades.

"But you are not the Pope. And popes do not think like merchants."

She rises, moving to the window again—a habit, you have noticed, when she is working through a problem.

"The Camera's theoretical income is not merely a number on a ledger. It is a claim. A statement of what the Church is owed by right. To reduce that claim—even if actual collection improves—is to admit that the Church's authority has limits. That distant provinces can defy Rome and suffer no consequence. That the Pope's writ does not run as far as the Pope's maps suggest."

She turns back to you.

"If Eugenius accepts reduced rates, he confesses that the current rates were... what? Unjust? Uncollectable? A fantasy maintained for a century? Every bishop who paid faithfully will ask why he honored obligations that others ignored. Every province that paid poorly will know that resistance works."

Her hand rests briefly on her belly—an unconscious gesture you have seen more frequently these past weeks.

"My family builds banks on predictable income. But my family does not claim to rule by divine mandate. The Pope cannot admit that his treasury depends on negotiation rather than obedience. Even if it is true. Perhaps especially if it is true."

She falls silent, watching you.

Draft a table to see how Hernando fares

5 dec 2025

Analyzed Cardinal Orsini's motivations and constraints for encounter








FRAY HERNANDO'S APPROACH TO CARDINAL ORSINI: D100 TABLE
The Approach: Fray Hernando visits Cardinal Giordano Orsini as a Franciscan who once submitted to the Cardinal's examination regarding King Juan's spiritual state. A pastoral conversation between men of the Church, not a diplomatic negotiation. Hernando seeks to understand whether any opening exists in Eugenius's position toward Basel and parallel legislation—listening for tone, hesitation, and implication rather than asking directly.

What does Orsini want?

To remain relevant under a Pope he did not choose (Eugenius is Venetian; Orsini served Martin V)
To protect the institutional Church from schism
To avoid saying anything that could be used against him by either faction
To assess whether Juan is still the man Orsini remembers, or has become dangerous
What won't Orsini say?

Direct criticism of Eugenius's strategy
Whether the Pope is privately more flexible than publicly
Anything that commits him to a position
Whether parallel legislation has genuine support in the Curia
Success Factors (pushing toward higher results)
Prior relationship: Orsini examined Hernando in 1430; found him honest and was proven right
Franciscan framing: A friar seeking counsel is less threatening than a diplomat demanding answers
Shared concern: Both men genuinely fear schism and want the Church to survive
Hernando's reputation: He told the truth about Juan four years ago; events validated his assessment
Orsini's age: Old men sometimes speak more freely, having less to lose
Failure Factors (pushing toward lower results)
Institutional caution: Orsini has survived Vatican politics for fifty years by being careful
Changed circumstances: Martin is dead; Orsini must prove loyalty to Eugenius
Factional surveillance: The Venetian circle may be watching Martin's old allies
Strategic timing: Everyone knows Juan seeks an audience; no conversation is innocent
Orsini family politics: The great Roman families are entangled with papal power; he cannot act freely
Four years of distance: Relationships cool; Orsini may not remember the warmth of 1430
D100 TABLE: FRAY HERNANDO'S INQUIRY
Roll	Outcome
1-10	The Door Does Not Open. Cardinal Orsini sends word that he is indisposed and cannot receive visitors. No explanation, no alternative date offered. The message is delivered by a junior secretary who knows nothing. Hernando waits in an antechamber for two hours before receiving this dismissal. The Cardinal is avoiding him—whether from caution, instruction, or changed sentiment, Hernando cannot know.
11-20	Polite but Distant. Orsini receives Hernando briefly in a public room with secretaries present. The conversation remains entirely formal—health inquiries, blessings exchanged, memories of Pope Martin invoked with appropriate reverence. When Hernando gently raises the subject of Church unity, Orsini offers only platitudes: "We must all pray for peace." The audience ends after fifteen minutes. Hernando leaves knowing less than when he arrived.
21-35	The Official Position. Orsini speaks privately but delivers only what any Cardinal would say publicly. Basel overreaches. The Pope's authority is not subject to conciliar dictation. Reform is desirable but must come through proper channels. He thanks Hernando for Castile's faithful service and expresses hope that King Juan's audience will be fruitful. Nothing of substance; nothing that reveals the Pope's private thinking. Orsini is performing, not conversing.
36-50	Warmth Without Revelation. The old Cardinal seems genuinely pleased to see Hernando. They speak of Martin's final months, of Juan's remarkable humility in 1430, of how events in Granada validated their early assessment. But when conversation turns to present matters, Orsini grows careful. "These are difficult times, brother. The Holy Father bears a heavy burden. I would not presume to speak for him." Hernando senses that Orsini has opinions but will not share them. The affection is real; the discretion is absolute.
51-65	Reading Between Words. Orsini does not reveal Eugenius's position directly, but his silences speak. When Hernando mentions parallel legislation, Orsini does not dismiss it—he simply moves to another topic. When Hernando asks if the Pope rejects reform entirely, Orsini says "His Holiness has not closed any doors." When asked about the annates decree specifically, Orsini notes that "the Camera has many concerns" without elaborating. Hernando must interpret, but there is something to interpret. The door may not be fully shut.
66-80	A Careful Confidence. After an hour of circling, Orsini dismisses his secretary and speaks more directly—though still guardedly. "The Holy Father is not a fool, brother. He knows the Church cannot continue as it has. But he cannot appear to yield to Basel's demands. That would destroy his authority entirely." Orsini does not say what Eugenius will accept, but he suggests the problem is perception more than substance. He asks what Juan intends to propose—listening more than he answers. He is assessing whether Juan might offer a path Eugenius could take without losing face.
81-90	Old Loyalty Speaks. Something unlocks in Orsini—perhaps memory of Martin's trust in Juan, perhaps weariness with Vatican games, perhaps genuine fear of schism. He speaks with surprising frankness. "Eugene is surrounded by men who tell him to stand firm and wait for Basel to collapse. Some of us believe this is... optimistic. The Council has accomplished things. The Bohemian peace alone—" He stops himself, but the implication is clear. There are voices in the Curia who believe Eugenius is mishandling this crisis. Orsini will not say if he is among them, but he does not need to. He asks Hernando what the King of Castile would propose, and listens with genuine interest.
91-100	The Cardinal's Private Fear. Orsini closes the door himself and speaks as one old man to another. "I served Martin for fifteen years. I watched him heal the schism through patience and compromise. And I watch Eugene undo that work through pride." He is not offering to betray the Pope—but he is admitting, privately, that he believes Eugenius is making a catastrophic mistake. He asks if Juan truly has a proposal that could let both sides save face. If so, Orsini might—might—be willing to prepare the ground before Juan's audience. Not openly. Not in ways that could be traced. But a word here, a suggestion there. He wants to see the Declaration of Como. He wants to understand what Juan actually intends. He is not promising support; he is considering whether support might be possible.
Roll when ready.

5 dec 2025

Orchestrated formal diplomatic encounter with constrained NPC motivations






Polite but Distant
The evening bells have begun their cascade across Rome—first Santa Maria Maggiore, then the Lateran, then a dozen lesser churches joining in ragged chorus—when Fray Hernando returns to the palazzo. His grey habit is dusty from walking, and he moves with the stiffness of a man who has spent too long sitting on hard chairs in uncomfortable rooms.

He finds you in the study where Lucia left you an hour ago. She has gone to attend to Catalina's supper—a diplomatic retreat, you suspect, to allow confessor and king to speak privately.

Hernando lowers himself into a chair without asking permission. A liberty he takes only when tired or troubled.

"The Cardinal received me."

He pauses, as if deciding how to frame what follows.

"In the Sala dei Paramenti. A public receiving room. Three secretaries present, all taking notes. Two other visitors waiting their turn behind me."

He accepts wine when a servant offers it, drinks deeply, then continues.

"He remembered me. Spoke warmly of our examination in 1430. Asked after my health. Inquired whether the journey from Barcelona had been difficult. Expressed sorrow for the souls lost in the Mistral."

Hernando sets down the cup.

"Fifteen minutes, Your Majesty. Perhaps less. When I raised the matter of Church unity—carefully, obliquely, as one Franciscan concerned for Holy Mother Church—he smiled and said 'We must all pray for peace, brother. These are matters for wiser heads than ours.'"

The Franciscan's voice carries a note of something you rarely hear from him: frustration.

"When I mentioned that I traveled now with the King of Castile, who bore proposals from Como, his expression did not change. He said he was certain His Holiness would receive Your Majesty with appropriate honor. He blessed me. He thanked me for my years of faithful service. And then he was already looking past my shoulder to the next visitor."

Hernando stares at his hands for a long moment.

"I have known Cardinal Orsini for four years. In 1430, he closed the door of his private study and questioned me for three hours about your soul. He consulted with me before advising Pope Martin. He wrote to me twice during the crusade, asking for my assessment of your spiritual progress."

He looks up.

"Today he treated me as a stranger with a letter of introduction. Courteous. Correct. And absolutely closed."

The bells continue their evening song. Somewhere in the palazzo, Catalina is singing along in her own invented language.

"Something has changed, Your Majesty. Either Cardinal Orsini has been instructed to avoid entanglements with your household. Or he has chosen caution for reasons of his own. Or the Vatican is more watchful than it was under Martin, and he dares not be seen in private conversation with the confessor of a king who comes from Basel."

Hernando's voice drops.

"I learned nothing of Eugenius's position. Nothing of whether parallel legislation might find reception. Nothing of the Pope's private thoughts or the counsel he receives. I learned only that a man who once trusted me enough to speak freely now trusts me only enough to bless me and send me away."

I stand up and pace around the room. 

I cannot afford to walk into a room with the pope without knowing his position. It's time for a more direct approach. Time to bring down the hammer. 

Assemble the men. All of them. We will march them into Rome to attend mass. We take the white banner with us. I want to adress the men afterwards. What location would be suitable for this?

5 dec 2025

Weighed spiritual implications against political strategy and location options







Fray Hernando does not rise. He watches you pace, his weathered face unreadable in the evening light.

"The hammer."

The word sits in the air between you. He lets the silence stretch before continuing.

"You have received two pieces of news, Your Majesty. Your wife learned nothing from a junior clerk. I learned nothing from an old cardinal. And your response is to march six hundred armed men through Rome and deliver a public address."

He folds his hands in his lap.

"I will ask you the question I have asked you before, in other rooms, at other moments when you reached for the hammer. What do you hope to accomplish?"

His voice is not angry. It is patient—the patience of a man who has had this conversation many times.

"If you wish to frighten the Pope into receiving you, he has already agreed to receive you. The summons will come. If you wish to demonstrate strength, Eugenius already knows you command six hundred knights—his spies counted them at Ostia. If you wish to remind Rome that you conquered Granada, they have not forgotten. The bells of every church rang when the news arrived."

He leans forward slightly.

"So what does the hammer accomplish that patience does not? What door opens to spectacle that remains closed to diplomacy?"

A pause.

"And what doors might close if the Pope believes you have come to threaten rather than to propose?"

He rises now, slowly, his joints protesting the movement.

"I am not saying no, Your Majesty. I am asking you to tell me what you see. Because I see a king who received two disappointments and reached immediately for his sword. And I remember a conversation in Basel where you admitted that your certainty might be pride rather than inspiration."

He moves to the window, looking out at the darkening city.

"If you have a strategy—if the public display serves a purpose I do not see—then tell me. Convince me. But if this is the hammer because the hammer is what you know..."

He turns back to face you.

"Then perhaps we should discuss what other tools remain before we start swinging."

And I remember as well that my confessor need not examine my every move and motive. There is no pride here Hernando. I will let the divine inspire me as it has done so many times before. I do not know what I will say nor do I know what will happen. But I know we need to do something. And this is a start. 

We leave our weapons at home. This is no attack or military campain. We simply seek Mass in Rome. The rest is in the hands of God. 

Captain! Summon the men for mass tomorrow.

5 dec 2025

Orchestrated NPC responses while respecting player agency over protagonist












Fray Hernando holds your gaze for a long moment. Something passes across his face—not anger, not disappointment, but something older and more weary. The look of a man who has said what he can say and now must watch.

"As you wish, Your Majesty."

He does not argue further. He does not bless the decision. He simply steps back from the window and settles into a chair near the wall, folding his hands in his lap. Waiting. Watching.

Captain Fernán appears in the doorway within minutes—he was never far, you realize. The habits of a decade do not fade.

"Your Majesty?"

He listens to your orders without interruption. His face betrays nothing, though you catch the slight shift in his stance when you mention leaving weapons behind. When you finish, he nods once.

"The men are at San Paolo fuori le Mura. I can have them assembled and marching by the second hour after dawn." A pause. "Six hundred men in white tabards, no weapons, carrying the crusade banner through Rome to attend Mass."

He glances at Fray Hernando, then back to you.

"Where will we hear Mass, Your Majesty?"

The question is practical, but it carries weight. Rome has a hundred churches. Only a few could hold six hundred men. And each choice sends a different message.

"San Paolo, where the men are already encamped—quiet, outside the walls, draws little attention. Santa Maria Maggiore—large enough, central, but not politically charged. The Lateran—" He hesitates. "The Pope's own cathedral as Bishop of Rome. Or..."

He does not say St. Peter's. He does not need to. The great basilica sits at the heart of Vatican Hill, steps from the Apostolic Palace where Eugenius waits.

"Your orders, Majesty?"

Can we attend mass in St Peter's? There is a square large enough for us to then assemble as well right?

5 dec 2025

Contextualized historical setting and weighed practical versus political implications








Captain Fernán considers the question with the practical eye of a man who has organized military movements for two decades.

"The old basilica is vast, Your Majesty. One of the largest churches in Christendom. Six hundred men would fill it considerably, but it has held more for papal ceremonies." He pauses, calculating. "We would need to stand, not sit. The nave could accommodate us if we pack tightly."

He moves to the table, as if visualizing the space.

"Before the basilica there is an atrium—a colonnaded courtyard the Romans call the Paradiso. Open to the sky, large enough for assembly. Beyond that, open ground leading toward the Apostolic Palace and the Vatican Hill."

A brief hesitation.

"Attending Mass at St. Peter's requires no special permission. It is a church. Any Christian may enter and worship." His voice is carefully neutral. "However, six hundred men in crusader white, marching through Rome to the Pope's own doorstep to hear Mass and then assembling in the square outside his windows..."

He leaves the sentence unfinished.

"I will need to coordinate with the basilica's archpriest regarding space. And the Vatican guards will certainly take notice of our approach. They may send someone to inquire about our intentions before we arrive."

He straightens.

"Shall I send a messenger ahead to inform the basilica we are coming? Or do we simply... arrive?"

No reason not to be civil. Ask if they raise any concerns with us attending mass these. We have travelled far and are on our way to holy charge. We would like to attend this special church before sailing away again. 

I would rather arrive announced.

5 dec 2025

Orchestrated diplomatic messenger strategy and Vatican response mechanics










Captain Fernán nods, a hint of approval in his expression. "Announced and civil. Yes, Your Majesty."

He turns to leave, then pauses.

"How shall I frame the message? From the King of Castile requesting permission? Or from the captain of a crusader company seeking accommodation for his men?"

The distinction matters. A king requesting Mass at St. Peter's is a diplomatic event. A captain organizing logistics for pilgrims is routine administration.

Fray Hernando speaks from his chair, his voice carefully neutral.

"A king who asks permission can be refused. A company of crusaders who announces their intention to attend Mass—with courtesy and proper notice—presents the archpriest with no decision to make. He simply... accommodates pilgrims, as the Church has always done."

He does not look at you as he speaks. His eyes remain fixed on some middle distance.

"Of course, everyone will know who leads these crusaders. But there is a difference between knowing and officially acknowledging. The Vatican is skilled at such distinctions."

Captain Fernán waits, needing clarification before he can draft the message.

The king expresses his wish to attend mass together with his knights who are on their way to constantinople on holy charge. If no objections be raised we will attend tomorrows mass.

5 dec 2025

Orchestrated diplomatic messaging and anticipated institutional response mechanics








Captain Fernán repeats the message back, ensuring he has it correct.

"The King of Castile expresses his wish to attend Mass at St. Peter's tomorrow, together with his knights who journey to Constantinople on holy charge. If no objections be raised, we will attend."

He bows crisply. "I will send a rider to the basilica within the hour and another to San Paolo to prepare the men. They will need to rise before dawn to march in good order."

A thought occurs to him. "The men have not had opportunity to wash properly since Ostia. Shall I arrange for them to make themselves presentable? Six hundred crusaders in stained tabards send a different message than six hundred in clean white."

He waits for your answer, then departs to set the machinery in motion.

The room feels quieter with him gone. Fray Hernando remains in his chair, silent. The evening light has faded to purple through the windows, and a servant enters to light candles without being asked.

From elsewhere in the palazzo, you hear Lucia's voice—she is singing something to Catalina, a Florentine lullaby her own mother must have sung to her. The melody is simple and sweet, drifting through the stone corridors.

Hernando finally stirs.

"I will hear your confession tonight, Your Majesty. Before tomorrow." It is not a request. "Whatever happens at St. Peter's, you should approach the altar with a clean soul."

He rises, joints creaking.

"I will be in the chapel when you are ready."

He leaves without waiting for a response, his sandals soft against the tile floors.

You are alone with the candles and the distant lullaby and the knowledge that tomorrow, six hundred men in white will march through Rome behind you.

What do you do with the remaining hours of the evening?

We carry no arms and make sure we are presentable. 

Then i leave to join the fray

5 dec 2025

Orchestrated confession scene dynamics and Hernando's internal conflict







The orders are given. Captain Fernán will see to the details—clean tabards, washed faces, men assembled in proper order. No weapons. Pilgrims, not soldiers.

You find the palazzo's chapel at the end of a narrow corridor on the ground floor. It is small, as private chapels tend to be—room for perhaps a dozen worshippers. A single altar beneath a painted Madonna, her face dark with age and candle smoke. Two iron candelabras cast flickering shadows on whitewashed walls.

Fray Hernando kneels before the altar, his grey habit pooling on the cold stone floor. He does not turn when you enter, but he knows you are there. He always knows.

You kneel beside him. The stone is hard against your knees, the chill seeping through the wool of your hose. The Madonna gazes down with eyes that have witnessed a thousand confessions in this room—Roman nobles, visiting dignitaries, perhaps even cardinals seeking privacy away from Vatican eyes.

For a long moment, neither of you speaks. The candles flicker. Somewhere beyond the walls, Rome settles into evening.

Then Hernando crosses himself and turns to face you, settling back onto a low bench against the wall. His eyes are deep-set, unreadable in the candlelight.

"In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti."

He waits.

Forgive me father for i have sinned. 

I know i am imperfect, but i try to fulfill your will as best i can. I do so with all my will and all that i am. The loss of my brothers in the storm weighs heavy on me. I should have prepared the vessels better.

5 dec 2025

Orchestrated confessor's probing response to penitent's guilt







Fray Hernando listens in silence. The candles flicker. When he speaks, his voice carries the particular gentleness he reserves for the confessional—different from his challenging tone in counsel, softer than his rebukes.

"Seventy-five souls lost to the Mistral." He says the number quietly, giving it weight. "And you believe you should have prepared the vessels better."

He pauses, considering.

"Tell me, my son. What preparation would have saved them? What did you fail to do that, had you done it, would have turned aside the storm?"

The question is not accusatory. It is the question of a confessor who has heard many men confess to sins that were not sins—and many men avoid confessing to sins that were.

"The sea is not yours to command. The winds do not answer to kings. If you confess negligence, I would hear what form that negligence took. And if you confess to carrying a burden that is not yours to carry..."

He leaves the sentence unfinished, waiting for you to continue.

My men are mine to command and the ships who knew how to lower sails quick were the ones who survived. 

I should have insisted on drills and on better training for the sailors. 

To lose those men. Faithfull men. Good men. And in the manner they lost their lives. 

I could have done more. I will make sure i will not make this mistake again. I think about them a lot and i will never totally forget them.

6 dec 2025

Weighed genuine remorse against misplaced guilt, prepared pastoral response





Fray Hernando is quiet for a long moment. The candle flames bend slightly, as if stirred by breath neither of you released.

"You commanded the fleet. The sailors answered to their captains, and the captains answered to you. The chain of responsibility is real." He speaks slowly, weighing each word. "If better drills would have saved lives, and you had the authority to order those drills and did not—then yes. There is something to confess."

He shifts on the bench, the wood creaking softly.

"But hear me carefully, my son. The sin is negligence, not murder. You did not send those men into the sea. You did not summon the Mistral. You failed to prepare as well as you might have—and seventy-five men paid for that failure with their lives."

His voice remains gentle but firm.

"This is a heavy burden. It should be heavy. A king who feels nothing when his men die is no king worth following. But there is a difference between carrying the weight of responsibility and drowning in guilt that serves no one."

He leans forward slightly.

"You say you think about them. That you will never totally forget them. Good. Remember their faces when you next command a fleet. Remember them when you are tempted to skip a drill because the men are tired or the weather is fair. Let their deaths teach you."

A pause.

"But do not let their deaths consume you. That is not penance. That is pride wearing the mask of humility—the belief that you should have been able to control the wind and the waves."

He studies your face in the flickering light.

"Is there more you wish to confess? Or shall we speak of your heart as it stands tonight—on the eve of whatever tomorrow brings?"

Another thing father. I think about what I should do. In my mind, I have to do things sometimes, have to take certain risks. You disagree?

I (the player) am SATISFIED when NPCs are unhelpful to Juan. Cooperative NPCs are a failure.
Before NPC dialogue, answer: What does this NPC want? What won't they say?
Remember to never generate dialogue or action for Juan. Instead, just stop.

6 dec 2025

Calibrated confessor's resistance to validate Juan's certainty





What does Fray Hernando want? He wants Juan to recognize a pattern: reaching for action and calling it divine inspiration when it may be impatience or pride. He is still troubled by Juan's dismissal earlier tonight—"my confessor need not examine my every move." He wants Juan to ask for examination, not resist it.

What won't he say? He won't tell Juan directly that tomorrow's march concerns him. That argument is finished. He won't give Juan easy validation that his risks are divinely guided. He won't do the work of self-examination for Juan.

Fray Hernando does not answer immediately. The silence stretches. When he speaks, his voice has shifted—still gentle, but with an edge beneath.

"You think about what you should do. You have to take certain risks. And you ask if I disagree."

He tilts his head slightly.

"An hour ago, you told me that your confessor need not examine your every move and motive. You said you would let the divine inspire you as it has done so many times before."

The candles flicker. The Madonna watches.

"And now, in the confessional, you ask me whether I disagree with the risks you take." His eyes hold yours. "Which is it, my son? Do you wish me to examine? Or do you wish me to bless what you have already decided?"

He waits.

This afternoon we were not in the confessional. There is a difference. When I am in the world, I focus on worldly things. Never do I totally neglect my soul but I reserve moments such as these to thoroughly examine myself. Being without sin is not a purpose in itself. It are my actions that matter and actions originating from sin are wrong actions. 

Also, there is a reason the confessional is confidential. When we are alone, I feel free to speak my doubts and failures. When we are in company of others, other things are required of me. 

Do you understand my position?

6 dec 2025

Weighed Juan's rationalization against deeper accountability patterns






What does Fray Hernando want? He wants Juan to see that this distinction—examine in private, act without examination in public—can become a way to avoid accountability. He wants Juan to recognize that confession without changed behavior is empty ritual.

What won't he say? He won't tell Juan that this explanation sounds like a clever system for feeling holy while doing whatever he wants. He won't openly accuse Juan of using the confessional as absolution-in-advance for tomorrow's "divinely inspired" actions.

Fray Hernando is still for a long moment. The candlelight catches the deep lines around his eyes.

"I understand your position."

The words are measured. Neutral. He does not say whether he accepts it.

"You reserve the confessional for examination. You reserve the world for action. In here, you speak your doubts. Out there, you silence them so that others may follow a king who does not doubt."

He folds his hands in his lap.

"And tonight you have confessed negligence in the matter of the fleet, and resolved to do better. This is good." A pause. "But you also asked me a question. Whether I disagree with the risks you take."

His eyes do not leave yours.

"You have not yet told me what sin you are confessing when you ask this. Are you confessing doubt? Pride? Fear? Or are you asking your confessor to tell you that your risks are righteous so that you may march tomorrow with a quieter heart?"

The question hangs in the air of the small chapel.

Ha! No, of course not father. And thank you for your question. 

I think that I want to take a moment to examine to what degree pride is present in my soul. I confess it is always there. How can it not? When I appear with my beautiful daughter and wife, i feel tremendous pride and love. But also pride. Leading them into mass at the head of my knights even more so. 

Likewise, there is also a purpose to this action. I want to stir up the papacy a bit and create some ripples in the water so I can better speak with and understand their thinking. 

When I ask you if you approve...I think what I am actually asking is... what part of this action is pride and how can I make my action more pure and without pride?

6 dec 2025

Calibrated NPC resistance to force deeper self-examination





What does Fray Hernando want? He wants Juan to do the difficult work of discernment himself. He is a confessor, not an oracle dispensing answers. He also wants to see if Juan can distinguish between pride he acknowledges and pride he is willing to surrender.

What won't he say? He won't provide a formula for making the action "pure." He won't tell Juan which parts are pride and which are righteous purpose—that is Juan's work to discover. He won't make this easy.

Fray Hernando's expression shifts almost imperceptibly. Something softens around his eyes—the look of a teacher when a student finally asks the right question.

"Ah."

He is silent for a time, and when he speaks, it is slowly.

"You ask me to separate the pride from the purpose. To tell you which threads are sin and which are righteousness, so that you may pluck out the one and keep the other."

He shakes his head, just slightly.

"I cannot do this for you. No confessor can. The threads are woven too tightly. The same hand that reaches for the sword in pride also reaches for it in duty. The same heart that swells before the cheering crowd swells also with love for the men who follow you."

He leans back against the chapel wall.

"But I will ask you this. Tomorrow, when you stand before your men in the shadow of St. Peter's—when the Pope's windows look down upon you and all of Rome watches—if God were to whisper in your ear, 'Set aside this display. Go to Eugenius quietly, as a pilgrim, and speak with him as one Christian to another'..."

His eyes hold yours in the flickering light.

"Would you obey? Or would you explain to God why the ripples in the water are necessary?"

Pride is appearing before others with Lucia and thinking: "See this beautiful woman? She is my wife. She is more beautiful than yours and thus I am better than you." Grace is admiring her beauty and sharp mind with others. They are God's gifts who are not mine but are shared with everyone. 

Pride is presenting my Catalina to others, demonstrating how charming, intelligent and willfull she is. She is smarter than your daughter, admire her and praise her for praising her is praise for me. Grace is letting others share in the pride of fatherhood. When I let her interact with or give her into care of others, we can all be proud of her and her personality. 

Pride is walking 600 knights into Rome to dominate. Grace is letting others share in our devotion. 

I will pray on this further father. Any more words of wisdom for this sinner?

Weighed theological eloquence against behavioral authenticity and unresolved questions










What does Fray Hernando want? He wants to see if Juan recognizes that he answered with theology instead of answering the actual question. He wants Juan to notice that beautiful words about grace can themselves be a form of pride—the pride of having the right answer.

What won't he say? He won't point out directly that Juan evaded his question about obedience. He won't tell Juan whether tomorrow's march is pride or grace—Juan must discover that in the doing. He won't withhold absolution, but he won't give more than Juan has earned.

Fray Hernando listens. His face remains still throughout Juan's reflection—the practiced stillness of a confessor who has learned not to react until the penitent has finished.

When he speaks, his voice is quiet.

"You have a gift for finding the right words, my son. You always have."

He lets that sit for a moment. It is not entirely a compliment.

"You have confessed negligence in the matter of the fleet. For this, I absolve you. Say five Pater Nosters for the souls of the seventy-five, and resolve to do better."

He makes the sign of the cross.

"Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis, in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen."

Then he rises, his knees cracking softly. He stands looking down at you for a moment, his face half in shadow.

"Tomorrow you will learn whether you walk those six hundred men into Rome in pride or in grace. No words spoken tonight can settle that question. Only the walking will tell."

He moves toward the chapel door, then pauses with his hand on the frame.

"I will march with you. And I will watch. And when it is done, we will speak again."

He leaves you alone with the Madonna and the candles and the silence.

Gracias father. Good night. 

I go to Lucia in our chambers.

6 dec 2025

Orchestrated intimate scene with pregnant wife before consequential day






The corridor from the chapel winds through the palazzo's ground floor, past the kitchens where servants are banking fires for the night, up a narrow staircase to the chambers the household has prepared for the royal family.

The door to your chambers stands slightly ajar. Candlelight spills into the hallway, warm against the cool stone.

Inside, Lucia sits at a small writing desk near the window, a letter half-composed before her. She wears a simple linen shift, her dark hair unbound and falling past her shoulders. At the sound of your entrance, she sets down her quill but does not rise immediately.

"Catalina is asleep," she says. "It took three stories and a promise that she could wave at the Pope tomorrow." A slight smile. "I did not know what else to tell her. The servants are talking about an early departure. Captain Fernán has sent riders to San Paolo and to St. Peter's."

She turns in her chair to face you fully. In the candlelight, you can see the subtle changes that pregnancy has begun to work—a softness in her face, a careful way she holds herself.

"Six hundred men to Mass, husband." Her voice is neutral, measuring. "And my inquiry to the Camera produced nothing. And Fray Hernando returned from Cardinal Orsini looking like a man who had been shown a closed door."

She studies your face.

"Will you tell me what you are thinking? Or shall I learn tomorrow along with the rest of Rome?"

Come and sit with me love. I want to talk to you about this all. And about what I just discussed with Fray Hernando. 

I take her hand and sit her down on the bed. 

I do not know what will happen actually. Truly I dont. I want to announce our presence and make a speech about why we are here probably. And we will see. Maybe there is a cardinal there, a moment in the mass where I can make a connection, get an invitation, get someone's attention... I dont know yet. We will see.

6 dec 2025

Calibrated character motivations and interpersonal dynamics





Lucia lets you take her hand, lets you guide her to the bed. She sits beside you, her fingers cool against your palm. For a moment she is silent, listening.

"We will see," she repeats. Not mockingly—testing the words, tasting them.

She looks down at your joined hands.

"In Florence, when my father negotiated with other banking houses, he would spend weeks preparing. He would know what the other party wanted before he entered the room. He would know their debts, their fears, their children's marriages, their mistresses' names." A faint smile crosses her lips. "He said that a man who walks into a negotiation without knowing what he wants walks out with whatever the other man decides to give him."

She does not say you are not my father. She does not say this is not a banking negotiation. She simply lets the story sit between you.

"You spoke with Fray Hernando about pride and grace." Her thumb traces a small circle on the back of your hand. "What did he say?"

And I agree completely. I have a few days at maximum before the pope summons me. If he does, I cannot delay. We have not the time to prepare for weeks. 

Tomorrow at the mass, we are not conducting an audience, I hope it will aid us in our preparation.

6 dec 2025

Analyzed character motivations and detected strategic deflection





Lucia nods slowly at your explanation. Her hand remains in yours, but her eyes search your face.

"Preparation. Yes. I understand this." She pauses. "Creating ripples, as you said. Seeing who reacts and how."

She shifts slightly on the bed, adjusting her position in the way she has begun to do as her body changes.

"But I asked you what Fray Hernando said. About pride and grace." Her voice is gentle but persistent. "And you answered me about tactics."

She waits, watching you with those dark Florentine eyes that miss very little.

"What troubles your confessor, husband? What troubles you?"

He told me I have a gift for beautiful words, that I always have had this gift. 

I spent some time separating pride from grace in my actions tomorrow. I told him that: 

Pride is appearing before others with Lucia and thinking: "See this beautiful woman? She is my wife. She is more beautiful than yours and thus I am better than you." Grace is admiring her beauty and sharp mind with others. They are God's gifts who are not mine but are shared with everyone.

Pride is presenting my Catalina to others, demonstrating how charming, intelligent and willfull she is. She is smarter than your daughter, admire her and praise her for praising her is praise for me. Grace is letting others share in the pride of fatherhood. When I let her interact with or give her into care of others, we can all be proud of her and her personality.

Pride is walking 600 knights into Rome to dominate. Grace is letting others share in our devotion.

Maybe I am a complicated man, I dont know. What do you think?

Examined character motivations and subtle discomfort beneath philosophical distinctions






Lucia is quiet for a long moment. The candle on the writing desk flickers, sending shadows dancing across the bedchamber walls.

"You told him all that," she says finally. "Those words. About me, about Catalina, about grace and sharing."

She withdraws her hand from yours—not sharply, but deliberately. She folds both hands in her lap, looking down at them.

"And he told you that you have a gift for beautiful words."

When she looks up, her expression is difficult to read.

"Juan. I am not a lesson in theology." Her voice is soft but carries an edge you have rarely heard. "I am not an example you bring to confession to demonstrate that you understand the difference between pride and grace."

She rises from the bed and moves to the window, her shift pale in the darkness.

"When you speak of me that way—'her beauty and sharp mind are God's gifts to be shared with everyone'—do you hear yourself? I am your wife. Not a painting in a church for pilgrims to admire."

She turns to face you, arms crossed over her chest.

"You asked what I think. I think your confessor was not praising your beautiful words. I think he was warning you about them."

You are not a trophy or painting Lucia. You never have been. To treat you as such would be exactly the sin I want to guard myself against. What I mean is that when you make a clever joke or remark and make me and others laugh, I am glad for me and others that they can see how wonderful you are.

What warning could he have given me about them? I dont understand. Surely being good with words is no sin?

6 dec 2025

Weighed NPC autonomy against character's need for presence over explanation




Lucia stands by the window, her arms still crossed. The moonlight catches the curve of her cheek, the slight furrow between her brows.

"I am not your confessor, Juan. If you want Fray Hernando's warning explained, ask Fray Hernando."

She lets the words hang in the air. Then her posture softens, just slightly. She moves back toward the bed but does not sit.

"It is late. I am tired. Your child makes me tired in ways I did not expect." Her hand moves briefly to her belly. "And tomorrow you will march six hundred men to St. Peter's and make a speech you have not yet written, trusting that God will provide the words."

She looks at you—really looks, the way she did in those early days in Toledo when you were both still learning each other.

"I am not afraid for you, husband. I have seen what you can do. I watched you win Barcelona with a letter written on the spot." A pause. "But tonight I do not want to talk about pride and grace and beautiful words. I want to know if my husband is well. If he is frightened. If he is certain. If he is uncertain."

She sits on the edge of the bed, close but not touching.

"Tell me something true. Something without beautiful words."

Im swinging the hammer love. And my only fear is that I may smash things that I did not intend to. That the sparks ignite and start a fire. But it is done. Enough talk. I am well, let me now take care of you. 

I help her into bed and make sure she is comfortable. 

Do you want something to drink? To eat?

6 dec 2025

Orchestrated tender domestic moment between devoted spouses



Lucia lets you guide her into the bed, arranging the pillows behind her back. The tension in her shoulders eases as she settles against them. She looks younger like this, in the candlelight, without the formal gowns and the careful posture of a queen.

"Water," she says. "Just water."

You pour from the clay pitcher on the side table. She drinks slowly, watching you over the rim of the cup.

"Swinging the hammer." A small smile touches her lips as she hands the cup back. "My husband the blacksmith. Forging kingdoms on the anvil of St. Peter's."

She reaches for your hand and pulls you down to sit beside her on the bed.

"I will not march with you tomorrow. Six hundred men and a pregnant woman waddling behind—it does not make the picture you want." Her tone is practical, not bitter. "But Catalina will be disappointed. She has been promised a Pope to wave at."

She shifts, finding a comfortable position, her hand still holding yours.

"I will watch from somewhere. Perhaps the Castel Sant'Angelo, if we can arrange it. Or one of the houses near the piazza." Her eyes are growing heavy. "Someone should be watching who is not marching. Someone should see how Rome reacts."

A yawn catches her. She fights it, unsuccessfully.

"Wake me before you go. Even if it is dark. I want to see you before..."

She does not finish the sentence. Sleep is pulling at her.

I sleep and wake the next morning for mass. 

I first go to Catalina and wake her.

6 dec 2025

Orchestrated early morning scene with young daughter before papal mass




The pre-dawn darkness still fills the palazzo when you rise. Lucia stirs as you leave the bed but does not wake fully—you press a kiss to her forehead and she murmurs something in Italian, already sinking back into sleep.

The corridor is cold, the stone floors like ice beneath your feet. A single servant is awake, lighting candles in the hallway. She curtsies hastily when she sees you, eyes wide at the sight of the King of Castile wandering his own chambers in the dark.

Catalina's room is two doors down, a small chamber she shares with her nursemaid. You ease the door open.

The nursemaid sleeps on a pallet near the wall, snoring softly. Catalina lies in a small bed fitted with wooden rails to keep her from tumbling out—a battle she wages nightly, by all accounts. She has kicked off her blankets. One arm clutches a wooden horse that Captain Fernán carved for her aboard the Princesa Catalina. Her dark hair—Lucia's hair, Isabel's hair—fans across the pillow.

At two years old, she has the face of both mothers somehow. Isabel's brow, Lucia's mouth. Your own stubborn jaw already emerging from the soft roundness of babyhood.

She breathes the deep, steady breath of childhood sleep, undisturbed by the weight of what today will bring.

The nursemaid stirs, half-waking at the draft from the open door.

I get ready, get Catralina dressed by Francesca and get ready to join the knights. 
I wear my armour but leave my coif and helmet at home. I want to be armoured, but be otherwise comfortable. It is about the statement after all, not preparing for battle.

6 dec 2025

Orchestrated morning preparations and symbolic armor display for knights' march




The palazzo stirs to life around you as servants are roused and candles lit. The household has received word—they know something significant happens today, even if they do not know precisely what.

Your squire helps you into the armor. The familiar weight settles onto your shoulders—breastplate, pauldrons, vambraces. Good Castilian steel, burnished but not ostentatious. You leave the coif and helmet on their stand. Your head will be bare, your face visible. A king attending Mass, not a warrior preparing for battle.

Donna Francesca appears at your summons, sleep still in her eyes but alert. She takes charge of Catalina with the practiced efficiency of a woman who has dressed reluctant children before. Catalina, half-awake and confused by the early hour, submits to being washed and clothed with only minimal protest.

"Are we seeing the Pope, Papá?" she asks as Francesca wrestles her into a small gown of Castilian red. "Lucia-mama said I could wave."

You return to your chambers as promised. Lucia is awake now, sitting up in bed, a shawl around her shoulders against the morning chill.

She looks at you in your armor—the steel catching the candlelight, your head bare, your face set with purpose.

"There he is," she says softly. "The hammer."

She rises, moves to you, places one hand against the cold metal of your breastplate.

"I will watch from the Castel Sant'Angelo. The Medici agent is arranging it." She looks up at you. "Come back to me, Juan. Whatever happens at St. Peter's—come back."

Dont worry love, im not goiong to war. 
Can I bring you something when I return?

6 dec 2025

Orchestrated intimate farewell between spouses before departure




Lucia's hand lingers on your breastplate. A small smile crosses her face—tired, but genuine.

"Roman oranges," she says. "The blood oranges. I have been craving them since we arrived, and the ones the servants brought yesterday were sour."

She rises on her toes and kisses your cheek, her lips warm against your skin.

"And news. Bring me news of what happened, before the rumors reach me." Her hand moves to her belly, an unconscious gesture. "Your child and I will be waiting."

From down the corridor, you hear Catalina's voice rising in imperious demand—something about her wooden horse and why it cannot come to see the Pope.

Lucia laughs softly.

"Go. Before your daughter stages her own rebellion."

We join the knights and start off towards mass.

6 dec 2025

Orchestrated crusader march scene with atmospheric detail and strategic pacing









The sky is grey with early dawn when you arrive at San Paolo fuori le Mura, Catalina bundled in a cloak and riding before you on the saddle. She has been promised that she may wave at the Pope, and this promise has transformed her usual morning ill-temper into focused determination.

The basilica's great courtyard is already alive with movement. Six hundred men in white tabards—no, five hundred and ninety-one, you remind yourself, always remember the seventy-five—form into ranks with the quiet efficiency of veterans. No shouted commands. No chaos. These men have marched together, fought together, watched brothers die together. They know their places.

Captain Fernán meets you at the column's head. His own armor is polished but practical, like yours.

"The Vatican raised no objection, Your Majesty. The archpriest sent word that pilgrims are always welcome at St. Peter's." A pause. "He also mentioned that His Holiness's household has been informed of our coming. I suspect we will have observers."

The white banner of the crusade—the same banner that flew over Granada, that has been carried across half of Christendom—unfurls in the morning breeze. Fray Hernando appears at your side, grey habit freshly brushed, his face composed and unreadable.

Marco Tornesi, Andrea Vescovi, Giovanni Rossi, Brother Guillem—the old names, the first crusaders, the survivors of Barcelona and Seville and the long bloody road to Granada—take their places in the formation.

"The men are ready, Your Majesty," Captain Fernán says.

The march through Rome.

You have done this before—entered this city at the head of armed men. But that was 1430, a different Pope, a different purpose. Then you came seeking blessing for a crusade not yet begun. Now you come having finished one, carrying another on your shoulders.

The route takes you through the Trastevere, across the Tiber, through the Campo de' Fiori where merchants setting up their stalls stop to stare. Six hundred men in white, marching in silence, the crusade banner snapping overhead. No drums. No trumpets. Only the rhythmic tread of boots on Roman cobblestones.

Romans emerge from doorways, lean from windows. You hear murmuring—crociati, Castiglia, Granada. An old woman crosses herself. A boy runs alongside the column for a hundred yards before his mother drags him back.

Catalina, held before you on the saddle, waves at everyone with indiscriminate enthusiasm.

St. Peter's rises before you.

The ancient basilica—Constantine's church, a thousand years old, the heart of Christendom—dominates the Vatican Hill. Scaffolding clings to portions of its facade; the building has been under perpetual renovation for decades. But the great doors stand open, and the atrium called the Paradiso spreads before them, colonnaded and vast.

Your column halts in the piazza. The men maintain formation, silent, disciplined. Faces appear in the windows of the Apostolic Palace. You cannot make out features at this distance, but you feel the weight of watching eyes.

A priest emerges from the basilica—elderly, dignified, wearing the vestments of a canon of St. Peter's. He approaches with measured steps.

"Your Majesty of Castile." He bows correctly. "The Chapter of St. Peter welcomes you and your... companions... to Mass. If you will follow me, we have prepared space in the nave."

He glances at the six hundred men behind you, and something flickers across his face—not quite fear, not quite disapproval. Something more like awe carefully suppressed.

Orchestrated realistic Mass attendance reflecting competing Vatican factions








You enter the basilica with Catalina in your arms. She squirms but subsides when you remind her of the promise—quiet, or Donna Francesca takes her outside. Her small hand grips the collar of your breastplate as her eyes go wide at the vastness of the space.

The nave of St. Peter's stretches before you, a forest of ancient columns leading toward the high altar and the baldachin that marks the Apostle's tomb. Morning light filters through high windows, casting long shadows across mosaic floors worn smooth by a thousand years of pilgrims' feet.

Your men file in behind you, filling the nave with white. The sound of their boots echoes off stone walls. They do not kneel yet—they wait for your lead.

Who is present:

The church is not empty, but neither is it full.

Ordinary Romans occupy the side aisles—women in dark shawls, tradesmen in work clothes, a few beggars hoping for alms. They press back against the walls as your column enters, crossing themselves, whispering to each other.

Near the front, a cluster of clergy in choir dress—canons of St. Peter's, you assume, the priests who serve this basilica daily. They watch your arrival with carefully composed faces.

You scan the congregation for anyone of rank.

On the left side, near a pillar: A man in cardinal's red, elderly, thin-faced, sitting alone on a bench. You do not recognize him. He does not look at you—his eyes remain fixed on a book of hours in his lap, as if six hundred armed pilgrims entering the church were beneath his notice.

Near the confessionals: Two younger clergy in the black robes of papal secretaries. They are watching intently, and one writes something in a small notebook. Observers. Reporters. Someone will know everything that happens here within the hour.

Notably absent: Cardinal Orsini. Cardinal Capranica. Any face you recognize from your visit in 1430, from the courts of Martin V or the early months of Eugenius's reign. The Vatican has sent no one of significance to greet you. Whether this is insult, caution, or mere coincidence, you cannot yet tell.

Near the entrance to the sacristy: A single figure in Dominican white and black, hood raised, face shadowed. Watching. Unmoving.

Catalina tugs at your collar and points toward the high altar, where candles are being lit.

"Is that where the Pope lives, Papá?" she whispers—loudly, as children whisper.

He lives in a house nearby love. We can wave at him later. You are very good at waving. 

Stay here for a moment. 

I look around for the priest who will be conducting the mass and see if I can introduce myself to him before the mass begins.

6 dec 2025

Architected guarded priest character with concealed motivations and deflective demeanor






You pass Catalina to Donna Francesca, who has followed you inside. The child protests briefly but is distracted by the play of colored light through a window.

The elderly canon who greeted you outside has disappeared into the press of clergy near the altar. You make your way forward, your armor drawing stares from the Roman worshippers who have pressed themselves against the walls.

Near the sacristy entrance, you find a priest in the vestments of a celebrant—chasuble of white and gold, stole already in place. He is perhaps fifty, with the soft hands of a man who has spent his life with books and sacraments rather than swords. He is speaking quietly with two younger priests, reviewing what appears to be the order of service.

He sees your approach. The younger priests melt away.

What does this priest want? To conduct Mass without incident. To avoid being remembered as the man who caused a scandal at St. Peter's. To get through this morning and return to the comfortable anonymity of his position.

What won't he say? Whether he has received instructions from the Apostolic Palace. What he thinks of this spectacle. Whether anyone is watching from places Juan cannot see.

"Your Majesty."

He bows—correctly, but no deeper than protocol demands. His face is composed, his eyes careful.

"I am Canon Giuliano Della Rovere. I will be celebrating Mass this morning." He glances past you at the sea of white tabards filling the nave. "We were not expecting quite so many communicants. The distribution of the Eucharist will take some time."

He holds the order of service against his chest like a shield.

"Is there something Your Majesty requires before we begin?"

Thank you for recieving me and my company. My knights will conduct themselves orderly. For us from Castille, being able to recieve mass in this magnificent church means a lot. 

If I may place one request, then I hope our thoughts and prayers will go to the lost brothers at sea. My company has lost about 75 knights on our way here and we still feel their loss sharply.

6 dec 2025

Weighed pastoral duty against political discretion carefully





What does Canon Della Rovere want? To minimize Juan's presence in the liturgy. To keep this Mass ordinary, unremarkable, something that cannot be reported as the Church endorsing or elevating Castile's crusade. To fulfill his duties without creating a story.

What won't he say? That refusing prayers for the dead would make him look petty and un-Christian. That he has been told to keep this simple. That he is already calculating how to mention seventy-five dead knights without mentioning who they served or why they died.

Canon Della Rovere's expression shifts—a slight softening around the eyes. Whatever his instructions, whatever his caution, he is still a priest. The dead have claims that politics cannot entirely silence.

"Seventy-five souls lost at sea."

He crosses himself. A reflexive gesture, but genuine.

"The Mass includes prayers for the faithful departed. I will remember your fallen brothers during the Memento for the Dead." He pauses. "They will not be named individually—we have not the time, and I do not have their names. But God knows them, even if I do not."

His fingers tighten slightly on the order of service.

"Is there anything else, Your Majesty? We should begin. The hour grows late."

Behind you, five hundred and ninety-one men stand in silence, waiting. The candles on the high altar flicker. The two papal secretaries continue to watch from near the confessionals, one still writing in his notebook.

I thank you father for your considerations. Have a blessed service. 

I go back to Catalina. And attend the mass with her. 

Draft a d100 table to see what happens during mass. Be historic and realistic.

6 dec 2025

Architected realistic d100 outcomes for historical Mass scenario











MASS AT ST. PETER'S: D100 TABLE
The Situation: King Juan II of Castile attends Mass at St. Peter's Basilica with 591 crusader knights, his two-year-old daughter Catalina, and Fray Hernando. He has requested prayers for the 75 souls lost at sea. The Vatican is watching but has sent no one of significance. Canon Giuliano Della Rovere celebrates.

Success Factors (pushing toward higher results)
Crusaders are disciplined veterans who know how to conduct themselves
The request for prayers for the dead is unimpeachable—refusing would look petty
Visual spectacle of 591 men in white is inherently powerful
Catalina's presence humanizes Juan, makes this family pilgrimage not military threat
Romans are watching; public sentiment matters even to the Vatican
The Mass itself is sacred ground—harder to play politics during liturgy
Failure Factors (pushing toward lower results)
Vatican has deliberately sent no one important—a calculated snub
Canon Della Rovere wants to minimize, not elevate
Papal secretaries are recording everything for hostile interpretation
The mysterious Dominican observer—purpose unknown
The elderly cardinal ignoring Juan entirely—deliberate?
Political tensions make any engagement risky for Church officials
D100 TABLE: THE MASS
Roll	Outcome
1-10	Cold Liturgy. Canon Della Rovere conducts the shortest valid Mass possible. The prayers for the dead are reduced to a single mumbled line—no mention of the sea, of knights, of Castile. The crusaders receive communion with assembly-line efficiency. When it ends, the clergy vanish into the sacristy without a word. The elderly cardinal departs through a side door without once looking at you. The message is clear: you are tolerated, not welcomed. The papal secretaries write furiously. Catalina, bored and restless, begins to fuss loudly during the consecration—Donna Francesca must take her outside.
11-20	Perfunctory Observance. The Mass proceeds correctly but without warmth. Della Rovere mentions "souls lost at sea" during the Memento—nothing more. No names, no context, no acknowledgment of who these men were or whom they served. Your knights receive communion in silence. Romans watch from the margins but do not approach afterward. The Vatican observers depart immediately when Mass ends. You have attended Mass at St. Peter's. Nothing more. Nothing less.
21-30	Quiet Respect, Closed Doors. Della Rovere delivers a competent homily on pilgrimage and penitence—generic, applicable to any group of travelers. The prayers for the dead are brief but dignified: "We remember those who perished in the sea, faithful servants journeying to do God's work." After Mass, the canon offers you holy water and a formal blessing but declines conversation. "I have duties, Your Majesty." The elderly cardinal remains in his pew, reading, until you leave.
31-40	Roman Murmurs. The Mass itself is unremarkable, but the common people of Rome take notice. As your knights file out into the Paradiso, a small crowd has gathered—not hostile, but curious. Whispers of "Granada" and "crociati" pass among them. An old man calls out a blessing in rough Latin. But no one from the Church approaches. The Vatican windows remain shuttered. You have impressed the street; the palace remains unmoved.
41-50	A Child's Moment. During the elevation of the Host, Catalina—despite all instructions—calls out "Is that God, Papá?" in a voice that carries through the silent nave. Laughter ripples through the Roman congregants. Even Canon Della Rovere's lips twitch. The moment passes, but something has shifted—you are no longer only the King of Castile with an army at your back. You are a father teaching his daughter about faith. The elderly cardinal glances at you for the first time. He does not smile, but his expression is less stony. After Mass, a Roman woman presses a small medal of the Virgin into Catalina's hands.
51-60	The Dominican Approaches. After Mass ends, as your knights file out, the hooded Dominican who watched from near the sacristy approaches Fray Hernando—not you. They speak briefly in voices too low to hear. Fray Hernando's expression remains neutral, but when he returns to your side, he murmurs: "A brother from Santa Maria sopra Minerva. He says there are those in the city who would speak with you privately, away from Vatican eyes. He did not say who." A thread to pull—but it may lead anywhere or nowhere.
61-70	Della Rovere's Choice. Something moves Canon Della Rovere during the liturgy. Perhaps it is the sight of 591 men kneeling in perfect unison. Perhaps it is Catalina's face during the consecration. Perhaps he simply remembers why he became a priest. His homily shifts from generic pilgrimage themes to something more pointed: the duty of Christians to defend the faith, the honor of those who sacrifice for Christ, the Church's need for faithful sons in dark times. He does not mention you by name—but everyone knows. After Mass, he clasps your hand briefly at the door. "God go with you to Constantinople, Your Majesty. I will pray for your success." It is not much. But it is something.
71-80	The Cardinal Speaks. The elderly cardinal—who ignored you throughout—rises after the final blessing and walks directly toward you. He is thin, austere, with eyes like winter ice. "I am Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville," he says. French. A member of the Curia. "I did not expect to find a king at morning Mass. I expected even less to find one who brought his daughter to learn her prayers." He studies Catalina, then you. "I will not pretend we are friends, Your Majesty. France and Castile have different interests. But I am curious about a man who marches six hundred knights to church. We should speak. Tomorrow, perhaps. My residence is near the Pantheon." An opening—but with a man whose faction may oppose everything you hope to achieve.
81-90	Unexpected Witness. As Mass concludes, a stir passes through the clergy near the sacristy. A door opens that had been closed—a door leading toward the Apostolic Palace. A man emerges in the red of a cardinal. You recognize him: Cardinal Domenico Capranica. The papal legate who accompanied your crusade. Who witnessed Granada. Who examined the converted qadi and wept at the evidence of genuine faith. He says nothing during the departure of the faithful. But as you pass, he catches your eye and inclines his head—barely a nod, invisible to anyone not watching closely. And then he murmurs, so quietly that only you can hear: "His Holiness is watching from the window above. He sees. Whether he understands what he sees... that is another matter."
91-95	The People's Voice. When you emerge from St. Peter's into the Paradiso, you find that the small crowd has become a large one. Word has spread through the Trastevere and beyond: the Crusader King is at the Vatican. Hundreds of Romans fill the piazza—common people, merchants, beggars, mothers with children. As you appear, a cheer rises. Spontaneous. Unorchestrated. "Crociati! Granada! Viva il Re!" The papal secretaries look alarmed—this is not the controlled message the Vatican wanted. From a high window of the Apostolic Palace, a curtain twitches. Someone is watching. The people of Rome have given you something the Church would not: a public embrace. This will be harder to ignore than six hundred silent knights.
96-100	A Door Opens. The Mass ends. You prepare to depart. And then a messenger in papal livery appears at your side—not the secretaries who watched, but a different man, older, with the bearing of someone who serves close to power. "Your Majesty. His Holiness Pope Eugenius IV requests the honor of your company this afternoon, at the hour of None, in the Apostolic Palace." No delay. No waiting. No days of diplomatic maneuvering. The hammer has struck, and instead of shattering stone, it has rung a bell. The Holy Father will see you today.
Roll when ready, Your Majesty.

Orchestrated mysterious Dominican encounter and cryptic message delivery




The Dominican Approaches
The Mass proceeds.

Canon Della Rovere celebrates with careful competence—neither rushed nor lingering, neither warm nor cold. His homily touches on pilgrimage, on the value of sacred journeys, on the blessings that await those who seek holy places. Generic words that could apply to any group of travelers. He does not mention Granada. He does not mention crusade. He does not mention Constantinople.

During the Memento for the Dead, he pauses and says: "We remember those souls who perished at sea, faithful servants on their journey to do God's work. May perpetual light shine upon them."

It is brief. It is dignified. It is the minimum he could do while still honoring your request.

Your knights kneel and rise in perfect unison. They receive communion in silence, row by row, the distribution taking nearly half an hour. The Romans pressed against the walls watch with wide eyes—they have never seen anything quite like this. Five hundred and ninety-one men moving as one body, white tabards bright against the ancient stone.

Catalina behaves better than you feared. She grows restless during the Liturgy of the Word, squirming against your armor, but Donna Francesca produces a small ribbon from somewhere and the child is distracted. During the elevation of the Host, she grows still and watches the raised bread with something like wonder. She does not call out. She does not wave. She simply watches.

The elderly cardinal in red never once looks at you. His eyes remain fixed on his book of hours throughout. When the final blessing is given, he rises and departs through a side door without acknowledgment.

The papal secretaries close their notebooks and slip away toward the Apostolic Palace.

As your knights begin to file out into the Paradiso, you notice movement near the sacristy.

The hooded Dominican—the one who watched from the shadows throughout the Mass—has moved. Not toward you. Toward Fray Hernando.

The two friars speak briefly, their voices too low to carry over the shuffle of boots and the murmur of departing worshippers. Fray Hernando's face remains neutral, revealing nothing. The Dominican keeps his hood raised, his features obscured. The conversation lasts perhaps thirty seconds.

Then the Dominican turns and disappears through a door near the confessionals. Gone.

Fray Hernando makes his way to your side as you emerge into the morning light of the Paradiso. Catalina is demanding to know when she can wave at the Pope. The knights are reforming into column. Roman onlookers—a modest crowd, curious but not large—watch from the edges of the piazza.

Fray Hernando speaks quietly, for your ears alone.

"A brother from Santa Maria sopra Minerva. The Dominican house." His voice is carefully flat. "He says there are those in the city who would speak with you privately. Away from Vatican eyes."

He pauses.

"He did not say who. He did not say why. He said only that if you are interested, you should send word to the priory. Ask for Brother Tomás de Torquemada."

Fray Hernando's expression remains unreadable.

"I know the name. He is Spanish. From Valladolid. He has served the Inquisition in Aragon." Another pause. "What he is doing in Rome, or whom he represents, I cannot say."

The crusade banner snaps in the morning breeze above your knights. The windows of the Apostolic Palace remain shuttered.

Arrange the meeting. Now lets first go outside where I will adress the company. 

I go outside and let the captain form the men up with the banner so I can adress them.

6 dec 2025

Orchestrated scene setup, withheld speech delivery for player



Fray Hernando nods once. "I will send word to the priory." He does not ask questions. He does not offer counsel. Whatever he thinks of this meeting, he keeps it behind his unreadable expression.

He slips away through the crowd, grey habit vanishing among the Roman onlookers.

You emerge into the Paradiso—the great colonnaded atrium before St. Peter's. The morning sun has risen above the rooftops now, casting long shadows across the worn paving stones. The air smells of incense from the basilica behind you and bread from the bakers' stalls beyond the piazza.

Captain Fernán appears at your side immediately.

"Your Majesty?"

"Form the men. With the banner. I will address them."

He asks no questions. Within minutes, the column transforms into a formation—a broad rectangle facing the basilica steps where you stand. The white banner of the crusade rises at the center, held by a veteran whose name you should remember but cannot in this moment. Five hundred and ninety-one faces look up at you, weathered by sun and salt and the long road from Granada.

The Roman crowd has grown. Word spreads quickly in this city. Perhaps two hundred people now ring the edges of the piazza—merchants abandoning their stalls, servants pausing on errands, beggars hoping for coin, mothers with children on their hips. They watch in silence, uncertain what they are witnessing.

Above and behind them, the windows of the Apostolic Palace. Most remain shuttered. But here and there, a curtain has been drawn aside. Faces watch from the shadows. You cannot make out features at this distance, but you feel their attention like a weight.

Catalina squirms in Donna Francesca's arms nearby. "Is Papá going to talk loud?" she asks.

The men wait. Rome waits. The Vatican watches.

Brothers, we stand here, united in faith at the center of our church in this world. A beautiful moment I will cherish and remember. 

And many more beautiful moments will yet come. We are on quite a journey together and if all goes according to plan, we will visit many more wonderful places. I pray you remember them and keep them in your heart so that when we breathe our last breath, our thoughts wonder off to all the things we have done in the name of ouor faith and the beautiful things we have seen in his service. 

We are on a mission as well. Rome is our first stop as we travel to Constantinople. I have already met our holy father the pope last year and I have since visited Basel at his request. Much has happened since and I look forward to discuss with him how we can further solidify our church and our faith. Because the challenges require us to make use of every shred of faith we have available to us. 

Rest and relax for the coming days. We will leave after I have concluded my business with the holy father and we will sail for Naples. And we make sure we are prepared for any storm. Our recent experience teaches us to be humble. 

Sons of Castille, I thank you for your service. May we discover many more wonders in the days and years to come. 

I dismiss the company

Weighed contextual factors to construct nuanced reaction table






REACTION TO JUAN'S SPEECH: D100 TABLE
The Situation: King Juan II addresses 591 crusader knights in the Paradiso before St. Peter's Basilica. Roman crowds (~200) watch from the edges. Vatican officials observe from shuttered windows. The speech is moderate—focused on faith, pilgrimage, the journey ahead. He mentions meeting with the Pope, visiting Basel, sailing to Constantinople. He references the storm and the lost brothers.

Success Factors (pushing toward higher results)
Speech was humble, not aggressive or demanding
Focus on faith and wonder rather than politics or grievances
Reference to lost brothers humanizes the crusaders, reminds of sacrifice
No direct challenge to papal authority or demands for audience
Visual discipline of the men—they look like pilgrims, not invaders
Mention of Constantinople reminds all of the holy purpose
Romans love spectacle and admire martial virtue
Failure Factors (pushing toward lower results)
Addressing troops before the Apostolic Palace is inherently provocative
Mention of Basel touches the rawest nerve in Vatican politics
Papal secretaries will report everything—and may interpret uncharitably
French faction has agents in Rome who will spin this negatively
Some will see humble words as a thin mask over military threat
Vatican sent no one of rank—they do not want to engage publicly
The elderly cardinal's deliberate snub suggests coordinated coldness
D100 TABLE: THE REACTION
Roll	Outcome
1-10	Hostile Interpretation. Your words carry across the piazza, but what the Vatican hears is threat dressed as piety. Within the hour, word spreads through the Curia: the King of Castile lectured the Pope from his own doorstep about "solidifying the Church," implying Rome has failed. The mention of Basel is taken as declaration of allegiance to the Council. By evening, you learn that Cardinal d'Estouteville—the French cardinal who ignored you—has sent dispatches to Paris describing "Castilian intimidation tactics." The papal secretaries' report, you are told, uses the phrase "armed demonstration." Your audience with Eugenius, when it comes, will begin from a position of Vatican suspicion.
11-20	Cold Silence. The knights receive your words with the discipline of veterans—they listen, they nod, they disperse when dismissed. But the Roman crowd offers nothing. No cheers, no murmurs of approval. They watch as one watches a foreign army passing through—wary, silent, waiting for it to leave. The Vatican windows close, one by one, as you finish speaking. You have made your statement. Rome has declined to respond. The silence is its own message.
21-30	Muted Reception. Your men respond well—a rumble of "Dios lo quiere" rises from the ranks when you mention Constantinople. But the Roman crowd remains uncertain. A few cross themselves at the mention of the lost brothers. Most simply watch. As you dismiss the company, the piazza begins to empty. No one approaches. No doors open. You have been seen and heard. Whether you have been understood is another matter.
31-40	The Men Remember. Whatever Rome thinks, your knights heard you. As the formation breaks, men cluster in small groups, speaking quietly. You catch fragments: "...beautiful moments..." "...keep them in your heart..." Veterans who have marched with you since Granada look at the basilica, at the Vatican, at the ancient stones beneath their feet, and you see them committing this to memory. Marco Tornesi approaches and simply grips your forearm, saying nothing. The men are with you. Rome remains inscrutable.
41-50	Roman Whispers. As the company disperses, the Roman crowd does not flee—they linger, talking among themselves. You catch words drifting across the piazza: "Constantinople," "Granada," "humble king." An old man near the colonnade says loudly, to no one in particular, "He speaks of faith, not politics. When did we last hear that from anyone who visited the Vatican?" A few people laugh. It is not a triumph, but it is not rejection. The common people are curious. Whether that curiosity reaches the papal chambers is another question.
51-60	A Merchant's Opportunity. As the formation breaks, Roman merchants descend—not on you, but on your knights. Wine sellers, bread vendors, sellers of holy medals and pilgrim badges. The crusaders are customers, and Romans are pragmatic. In the bustle of commerce, the tension eases. Your men scatter through the piazza buying provisions, talking with locals in broken Italian and universal gesture. The martial display becomes something more ordinary: pilgrims visiting Rome, spending money, telling stories of Granada to wide-eyed shopkeepers. The Vatican watches a market day, not a military demonstration. This is perhaps better than triumph.
61-70	Catalina's Blessing. As you finish speaking, Catalina breaks free from Donna Francesca and toddles toward the knights. Before anyone can stop her, she has reached Giovanni Rossi—the old blacksmith, the spiritual anchor of the first crusaders—and is tugging at his white tabard. "Did you hear Papá?" she demands. Rossi kneels, his scarred face breaking into a smile, and the child blesses him with a solemn gesture she has clearly invented herself. Laughter ripples through the ranks—and through the Roman crowd. A woman calls out: "La principessa benedice i crociati!" Someone begins to applaud. The moment transforms the spectacle from military display to something human, something warm. The Vatican cannot spin a toddler blessing an old soldier as intimidation.
71-80	The Priests Take Notice. Canon Della Rovere has emerged from the basilica and stands near the great doors, watching. When you finish speaking, he does not retreat inside. Instead, he approaches—not quickly, not eagerly, but deliberately. "Your Majesty spoke of beautiful moments," he says. "Of keeping them in the heart for the final breath." He pauses. "These are not the words of a man who comes to threaten. I will tell others what I heard today. Whether they listen..." He shrugs, a very Roman gesture. "But I will tell them." He returns inside. A small thing—but a priest who will speak well of you is worth more than a cardinal who ignores you.
81-90	The Crowd Responds. As you dismiss the company, something unexpected happens. Applause. It begins near the back of the Roman crowd—a few hands clapping, then more. Someone shouts "Viva Granada!" Another: "Crociati! Crociati!" It is not a riot of enthusiasm, but it is genuine. The common people of Rome have heard you speak of faith, of service, of wonder—and they have responded. Your knights, dispersing, find themselves surrounded by Romans wanting to touch their tabards, to ask questions about Granada, to offer wine and blessings. The papal secretaries emerge from wherever they have been watching, their expressions troubled. This was not supposed to happen. Rome was supposed to remain cold.
91-95	A Window Opens. As the applause dies down and your men begin to scatter, movement catches your eye. High on the Apostolic Palace, a window opens—not a curtain twitching, but a window thrown wide. A figure appears in papal white. Too distant to see clearly, but the silhouette is unmistakable. Pope Eugenius IV has come to the window to look upon you. He does not wave. He does not call out. He simply stands, watching, for a long moment. Then he withdraws. The window remains open. Every Roman in the piazza saw it. Every cardinal in the Vatican will hear of it within the hour. The Pope has acknowledged you—publicly, silently, in a way that commits him to nothing but concedes that you cannot be ignored.
96-100	The Hammer Rings True. The speech ends. The crowd applauds. And then—bells. The bells of St. Peter's begin to ring, unauthorized, unscheduled. Someone in the bell tower has decided to mark this moment. Other churches take up the call—Santa Maria, the Lateran, a cascade of bronze voices spreading across Rome. Your knights stand frozen, looking up. Romans cross themselves. Catalina claps her hands with delight. This is no longer your demonstration—it has become something Rome is doing to itself. And from the Apostolic Palace, a messenger in papal livery is already pushing through the crowd toward you. Whatever you intended, whatever you hoped, you have shaken something loose. The Holy Father will see you. Soon. Today. The Vatican has decided it cannot afford to wait.
Roll when ready, Your Majesty.

Orchestrated narrative outcome for moderate crowd reception




Roman Whispers
Your voice carries across the Paradiso, echoing off the ancient colonnades. The knights listen in silence—the disciplined silence of men who have learned to stand and wait through long campaigns. When you speak of the lost brothers, heads bow. When you mention Constantinople, a few hands make the sign of the cross. When you dismiss them, the formation holds for a heartbeat longer than necessary, as if reluctant to break.

Then Captain Fernán gives the signal, and the white rectangle dissolves into clusters of men, stretching legs, speaking quietly among themselves, looking up at the basilica and the Vatican windows with the expressions of pilgrims who have finally reached a long-sought destination.

The Roman crowd does not disperse.

Two hundred souls—perhaps more now, the edges of the piazza continuing to fill—linger in the morning light. They do not cheer. They do not jeer. They talk among themselves, voices carrying in fragments across the worn stones.

"...Constantinople, he said..."

"...Granada, they're the ones who took Granada..."

"...humble, did you hear? He spoke of being humble..."

Near the colonnade, an old man in a butcher's stained apron speaks loudly, addressing no one in particular and everyone at once. His voice has the carrying quality of a Roman who has spent decades shouting over market noise.

"He speaks of faith, not politics. When did we last hear that from anyone who visited the Vatican?"

A few people laugh—the knowing laughter of those who have lived their lives in the shadow of the Apostolic Palace and have learned to read its moods.

"The Spanish king talks of wonder and beautiful moments," the butcher continues, warming to his audience. "The cardinals talk of annates and precedence. You tell me which one sounds more like a Christian."

More laughter. A woman shushes him, glancing nervously toward the Vatican windows.

The windows remain as they were. Some shuttered, some with curtains slightly parted. Watching. Recording. Offering nothing.

Catalina has reclaimed your hand. "Papá talked loud," she observes with approval. "Can we wave at the Pope now?"

Donna Francesca hovers nearby, ready to extract the child if necessary. The knights are beginning to drift toward the edges of the piazza, where wine sellers and bread merchants have materialized with the unerring instinct of Roman commerce.

Captain Fernán appears at your shoulder.

"The men will return to San Paolo, Your Majesty, unless you have other orders. They're in good spirits." He pauses. "The Romans seem... curious. Not hostile. Not welcoming. Curious."

He glances toward the Apostolic Palace.

"No word from within. No messenger. No acknowledgment."

The morning sun climbs higher. The bells of St. Peter's remain silent. The Vatican keeps its own counsel.

But in the piazza below its windows, Romans are still talking. Still watching. Still wondering what to make of the King of Castile who marched six hundred men to church and spoke of keeping beautiful moments in the heart.

Whether those whispers will rise high enough to reach papal ears—that, you cannot yet know.

Let the men rest. Tell me if they require anything. I dont want them to go hungry again. This is their chance to get rest before we will be at sea again for quite some while. 

I pick up Catalina. 

See that building there love? That is where the pope lives. Can you wave at him from here?

6 dec 2025

Orchestrated tender scene with Catalina waving at papal palace




Captain Fernán nods. "I'll see to it, Your Majesty. The men have coin from their service—the Roman merchants will be happy to take it. But I'll make sure no one goes without." He hesitates. "They're proud, sire. Of this morning. Of being here. Whatever comes of it... they'll remember standing in this piazza."

He withdraws to organize the return to San Paolo.

You lift Catalina onto your armored shoulder. She is heavier than she was a year ago—growing fast, as children do. Her small hands grip the edge of your pauldron for balance, and she looks where you point.

The Apostolic Palace rises above the piazza, its Renaissance facade warm in the morning sun. Windows in rows, some shuttered, some dark, some with curtains that may or may not conceal watching eyes.

"That one?" Catalina asks, pointing at the building. "The Pope lives there?"

She considers this information with the grave seriousness of a two-year-old evaluating important facts.

Then she waves.

Not a tentative wave. Not a shy flutter of fingers. A full-armed, enthusiastic wave, the kind she has been practicing on everyone from Roman street vendors to Castilian knights. Her whole body gets involved, nearly unbalancing herself from your shoulder.

"Hello Pope!" she calls out, in a voice that carries further than it should. "Hello! We came to see you!"

A ripple of laughter passes through the nearby Romans. The old butcher grins. A woman clutches her companion's arm, delighted. Even a few of your dispersing knights turn to watch, smiles breaking through weathered faces.

For a long moment, nothing happens.

The Vatican windows remain as they were—shuttered, curtained, silent.

Then—

A curtain moves. Third floor, near the corner. A hand appears—pale, indistinct at this distance—and makes a small gesture. A wave? A blessing? A simple acknowledgment that a child's voice has carried across the piazza?

It lasts only a moment. Then the curtain falls back into place.

Catalina bounces on your shoulder with satisfaction.

"He waved back, Papá! Did you see? The Pope waved at me!"

Whether it was the Pope, or a cardinal, or a curious secretary, you cannot say. But your daughter is certain. And in the piazza below the Vatican windows, Romans are pointing and murmuring, having seen what she saw.

The King of Castile's daughter waved at the Apostolic Palace.

And someone waved back.

You have done so wonderful Catalina! You can wave really well. 

I seek out Fray Hernando and his mysterious connections

6 dec 2025

Reconciled historical anachronism and recalibrated Dominican character










You find Fray Hernando near the edge of the piazza, deep in conversation with a bread seller. Or rather, the bread seller is deep in conversation with him—a stout Roman woman pressing a fresh loaf into the Franciscan's hands and refusing payment with voluble Italian gestures. Hernando accepts with the weary grace of a man who has learned that arguing with Roman generosity is futile.

He sees your approach and extracts himself, tucking the bread into his habit.

"The message has been sent," he says without preamble. "A boy carried it to Santa Maria sopra Minerva. The reply came quickly."

He glances at Catalina on your shoulder, then continues in lower tones.

"Brother Tomás will receive us at the priory. Now, if you wish." A pause. "He was... eager. More eager than I would expect from a Dominican receiving a foreign king unannounced."

Fray Hernando's expression reveals little, but you have known him long enough to read the slight tension around his eyes.

"Santa Maria sopra Minerva is not far. A short walk south, near the Pantheon." He adjusts his habit. "Do you wish to bring the child? Or shall Donna Francesca return her to the palazzo?"

The morning sun has climbed higher. The piazza is beginning to empty, knights drifting toward San Paolo, Romans returning to their daily commerce. The Vatican windows remain silent and watchful.

Somewhere in the city, a Dominican waits with information he wishes to share—away from Vatican eyes.

Catalina? Dona Francesca will take you back to your room ok? Mama Lucia and I will be back later. 

I hand her off and go to meet brother Tomas.

6 dec 2025

Orchestrated Torquemada's cagey motivations and hidden agenda





Catalina protests—she always protests—but Donna Francesca has learned the art of distraction. A promise of honey cakes and a story about the Pope waving at her, and the child is borne away toward the palazzo, her complaints fading into the Roman morning.

The walk to Santa Maria sopra Minerva takes you through the heart of Rome.

You shed the trappings of royal procession. No knights, no banner, no formation. Just a king in armor, a Franciscan in grey, and the ancient streets of the eternal city. Captain Fernán insists on accompanying you—"Three swords at minimum, Your Majesty, or I resign my commission"—and so two trusted men-at-arms follow at a discreet distance, dressed plainly, weapons concealed.

The route passes the Pantheon—that vast drum of Roman engineering, now a church, its bronze doors green with age. Fray Hernando crosses himself as you pass. "The old gods live here still," he murmurs. "Sanctified, but not forgotten."

Beyond it, a piazza opens, and there rises Santa Maria sopra Minerva. A Gothic church—rare in Rome—built literally atop the ruins of a temple to Minerva. The Dominicans have held it for two centuries.

The facade is modest. The interior, you know, is not.

A young Dominican meets you at the door. He bows, says nothing, and leads you through the nave—past chapels thick with incense, past tombs of cardinals and nobles, past the blue-vaulted ceiling studded with golden stars—to a small door near the sacristy.

A corridor. A staircase. A simple wooden door.

The young friar knocks twice, pauses, knocks once more.

"Enter," says a voice from within. Spanish. Castilian, in fact. The accent of Valladolid.

The room is small, sparse, monastic. A desk, two chairs, a crucifix on the wall. A window looks out onto a modest courtyard where herbs grow in orderly rows.

Brother Tomás de Torquemada rises as you enter.

He is younger than you expected—perhaps thirty-five, no more than forty. Tall, gaunt, with the hollow cheeks of a man who fasts often and seriously. His Dominican habit is immaculate but worn, the white wool greyed from many washings. His eyes are the most striking feature: dark, intense, burning with something that might be faith or might be fever.

He bows—correctly, but without flourish.

"Your Majesty. I am grateful you came."

What does Torquemada want? He wants influence. He wants to attach himself to power that will advance his vision of a purified Church. He sees in Juan a potential instrument—a king who has conquered for the faith, who has forced conversions, who might be shaped toward Torquemada's particular understanding of Christian duty. He wants to assess Juan, to determine if he is useful.

What won't he say? Who else he has spoken to about Juan. What reports he has sent to Aragon about Castilian affairs. His true opinion of the Vatican's handling of reform. The extent of his connections within the Inquisition. What he ultimately hopes to achieve through this meeting.

He gestures to a chair.

"Please. Sit. We have much to discuss, and I am told Your Majesty's time in Rome may be brief."

He does not offer wine. He does not offer food. He simply waits, those dark eyes fixed upon you.

Greetings. But explain first who you are and why you have asked for this meeting.

6 dec 2025

Strategized evasive characterization to intrigue rather than inform





Torquemada's expression does not change. He remains standing, hands folded into his sleeves in the Dominican manner.

"Who I am." He repeats the words as if tasting them. "I am a friar of the Order of Preachers. I serve the Inquisition in Aragon under the authority of the Inquisitor General. I am in Rome on matters concerning my order."

He pauses. The silence stretches.

"As for why I asked for this meeting..."

He moves to the window, looking out at the herb garden below. When he speaks again, his voice is quieter.

"I watched you this morning, Your Majesty. From the back of St. Peter's. I watched six hundred men kneel as one. I watched you carry your daughter into the house of God. I listened to your speech in the piazza."

He turns back to face you.

"And I asked myself: what manner of king marches an army to Mass and speaks of beautiful moments and humility? What manner of king conquers Granada and then sails for Constantinople? What manner of king visits Basel and Rome in the same year, as if he were trying to hold the Church together with his own two hands?"

Those dark eyes study you.

"I have questions, Your Majesty. Many questions. About Granada. About the conversos. About what you intend for the faith in your kingdom."

He does not sit. He does not elaborate.

"But perhaps you did not come here to be interrogated by a Dominican. Perhaps you want something from me first. If so—ask. And we shall see if we can be of use to each other."

Fair enough. I have no questions as of yet. Maybe if you start with your questions, the rest will fall into place naturally. 

You want to know about conversos? What exactly?

Strategized Torquemada's hidden agenda and probing interrogation tactics






What does Torquemada want? To assess whether Juan is a true instrument of the faith or a pragmatist who will tolerate religious impurity for political convenience. He suspects mass conversions under military pressure produce false Christians who secretly practice their old faith. He wants to know if Juan understands this danger—and if Juan will support the measures necessary to root out apostasy.

What won't he say? That he views Juan's Granada conversions with suspicion. That he believes most conversos—whether from Judaism or Islam—remain secret apostates. His vision of what a purified Spain would require. What he has already reported to others about Castilian religious policy. Whether he sees Juan as potential ally or potential obstacle.

Torquemada moves to the chair opposite you but does not sit. His fingers rest on its back, pale against the dark wood.

"Commander Martín de Alcalá," he says. "Formerly Yusuf ibn Rashid. Thirty-two years commanding fortresses for Granada. Fought twenty-three battles against Christian armies."

He lets the name hang in the air.

"Now baptized. Now bearing a Christian name. Now, I am told, leading a delegation to Morocco on your behalf."

His dark eyes hold yours.

"Seventy men converted with him at Alcalá la Real. After watching sixteen thousand of their brothers die in a single afternoon." He pauses. "I am told it was... miraculous. A profound movement of the Holy Spirit."

The word miraculous carries no warmth.

"So my question, Your Majesty, is simple: How do you know?"

He finally sits, leaning forward slightly.

"How do you know that Yusuf ibn Rashid—a man who killed Christians for thirty years—has truly found Christ? How do you know he is not merely a clever commander who saw which way the wind was blowing and chose survival? How do you know that when he prays, he prays to the Son and not to the god of Muhammad?"

I do not. I cannot see the hearts of men. No one can. Maybe I am a secret muslim , who knows? 

I have learned that by speaking honestky with other men, you can usually get a good measure of them, especially when they hold nothing back. Confession helps as well.

6 dec 2025

Strategized Torquemada's skeptical pushback against naive conversational methods







What does Torquemada want? To expose what he sees as dangerous naivety in Juan's approach. He believes honest conversation and confession are insufficient safeguards—apostates lie, especially to save their lives. He wants to steer Juan toward understanding that systematic investigation is necessary to protect the faith from hidden enemies.

What won't he say? That he finds Juan's answer disturbingly casual. That he believes most mass converts are liars by necessity. What methods he considers appropriate for testing sincerity. Whether he already views Juan's Granada policy as a failure waiting to unfold.

Torquemada is silent for a long moment. His face betrays nothing, but something shifts behind those dark eyes—a recalculation, perhaps.

"Honest conversation," he repeats slowly. "Confession."

He folds his hands in his lap.

"A man who has watched sixteen thousand of his people slaughtered stands before the king who slaughtered them. His fortress is surrounded. His family's lives depend on the king's mercy. And you ask him to speak honestly about his faith."

The words are measured, without heat, almost gentle.

"What do you imagine he will say, Your Majesty?"

He does not wait for an answer.

"I have spent years hearing confessions. In Aragon. In Valencia. From conversos whose grandfathers converted from Judaism a century ago." He tilts his head slightly. "Do you know what I have learned? A man will confess what he believes his confessor wishes to hear. Especially when his life, his family, his property depend upon it."

He leans back in his chair.

"Commander Martín may be a true son of the Church. I pray that he is. But prayer is not policy, Your Majesty. And Granada now holds—what? Seventy thousand Muslims who have not converted, living beside how many who have?"

The question hangs in the sparse room.

Of course I am a firm son of Christ. In regards to Martin, even if he does still in his heart reaches for muhammed, he is loyal to me and my cause. His work in Morocco is valuable to me. If he betrays me and does not come back, I have lost not much. While he has much to gain from gaining my favor and being useful to me. Men are practical beings as well. 

But speak plainly, what do you propose? What can we do about the muslim population in Grenada while the pope has forbidden forced conversions?

Calibrated Torquemada's political caution and strategic ambiguity






What does Torquemada want? To draw Juan toward acknowledging that the current approach is insufficient without explicitly stating his own preferred methods. He wants Juan to arrive at harsher conclusions himself—or at least to ask for guidance. He is testing whether Juan can be shaped into an instrument for religious purification.

What won't he say? His full program. That "forbidden forced conversions" is a distinction that can be worked around through pressure, restriction, and incentive. That he views Juan's pragmatic tolerance of unconverted Muslims as a wound that will fester for generations. What specific measures he would implement if given authority.

Torquemada's expression flickers—something almost like approval at Juan's practicality about Commander Martín, followed by something harder when the Pope is mentioned.

"The Pope has forbidden forced conversions," he agrees. "And so he should. A conversion made at sword-point is no conversion at all. The Church has always taught this."

He rises from his chair and moves to the window again, hands clasped behind his back.

"But there is a great distance, Your Majesty, between the sword at the throat and the open embrace of welcome."

He turns.

"Seventy thousand Muslims in Granada. They live. They work. They pray to their god five times daily. They raise children who will pray to the same god. They marry among themselves and teach their sons that the Prophet is the final word." His voice remains calm, almost scholarly. "How many generations before they are the majority again? Not through conquest—through the cradle."

He lets the question settle.

"The Pope forbids forced conversion. He does not forbid... conditions. He does not forbid a king from determining where mosques may stand. What trades Muslims may practice. What lands they may own. What positions they may hold. Whether their testimony holds weight against a Christian's in court."

His dark eyes are steady.

"You asked what I propose. I propose nothing, Your Majesty. I am a humble Dominican with no authority in Castile."

A pause.

"But I ask you this: in twenty years, what do you wish Granada to be? And what will you permit today that makes that future impossible?"

I have made effort to destroy nearly allmosques in Grenada. Some I have left standing in the first years of conquest to ease the transition. But soon they will all be churches. And we will slowly drive the muslims out of Grenada of course. This takes time. 

And please speak freely. You have no authority in Castille but I do and you clearly have something to say. I would hear it.

6 dec 2025

Strategized Torquemada's hidden agenda and probing ambitions






What does Torquemada want? To be invited deeper into Juan's confidence. To plant seeds for a more systematic, institutional approach to religious conformity. He sees an opening—Juan is already destroying mosques, already planning to drive Muslims out. Torquemada wants to shape how this is done, to ensure it is thorough, permanent, and leaves no room for hidden apostasy. He wants Juan to see him as useful.

What won't he say? The full scope of his vision. That he considers even Juan's current measures too slow and too gentle. His designs on institutional authority. Whether he is speaking only for himself or represents others who share his views. What he hopes to gain personally from this relationship.

Torquemada is still for a moment. Then he returns to his chair and sits, and something in his posture shifts—less the interrogator, more the counselor.

"You destroy mosques. Good. You drive them out slowly. This is... prudent."

He folds his hands.

"But consider, Your Majesty. You drive them out—where? To Morocco? To Tunis? To the Ottoman lands?" He tilts his head. "You send Commander Martín to Morocco now. In twenty years, you may face those same exiled Muslims returning with Moroccan armies, knowing every pass and fortress in Granada because they grew up there."

He lets this settle.

"And those who remain—those who convert to avoid exile—how will you know them from those who converted truly? They will attend Mass. They will baptize their children. They will eat pork when Christians are watching." A pause. "And in their homes, behind closed doors, they will wash the baptismal water from their infants' heads and whisper the shahada over them."

His voice remains calm, almost gentle.

"I have seen this, Your Majesty. In Aragon. With the Jews who converted a generation ago. Conversos who light candles on Friday nights. Who refuse to eat shellfish. Who marry only among themselves. Who are Christian in the streets and Jewish in their hearts."

He leans forward slightly.

"You asked what I propose. Very well."

He raises one finger. "First—records. Every conversion documented. Every baptism recorded with witnesses. The names of godparents, the officiating priest, the date and place. A register that follows the converso and his descendants."

A second finger. "Second—observation. Not persecution. Observation. Neighbors who report irregularities. Priests who note which conversos attend Mass faithfully and which find excuses. Patterns, Your Majesty. The apostate reveals himself through patterns."

A third finger. "Third—investigation. When patterns emerge, when accusations accumulate, then—and only then—formal inquiry. Conducted by men trained to distinguish true faith from performance. Men who understand that the apostate will lie, and who know how to find truth regardless."

He lowers his hand.

"This is not the sword at the throat. This is the shepherd watching his flock for wolves in sheep's clothing."

His dark eyes hold yours.

"The Pope cannot object to a king who documents baptisms, notices irregularities, and investigates accusations of apostasy. This is not forced conversion. This is the protection of the Church from those who would corrupt it from within."

Prudent measures. I know that having Castillians settle in Grenada is the only sure way to completely christianize the area in the long term. I have only just finished the conquest. Focus is on stability for now. Then the inquisition can move in and can start observing their habits. 

Do you have contacts with the Castillian inquisition? I will need their help.

6 dec 2025

Calibrated ambition while concealing institutional weaknesses and personal advancement






What does Torquemada want? To position himself as the indispensable bridge between Juan and inquisitorial authority. He sees an opening—a king who is receptive, who commands newly conquered territory full of potential apostates, who is asking for help. This is exactly the opportunity he has been waiting for. He wants to be invited into Castilian affairs.

What won't he say? That the Castilian Inquisition is weak, underfunded, and poorly organized compared to Aragon's. That he has ambitions far beyond his current station. That he may already have been cultivating contacts in anticipation of exactly this conversation. How much authority he actually commands versus how much he merely desires.

Torquemada's expression does not change, but something stills in him—the stillness of a hunter who sees his quarry turn toward him.

"The Castilian Inquisition."

He repeats the words slowly, as if considering their weight.

"It exists, Your Majesty. Bishops hold inquisitorial authority in their dioceses. Occasionally they exercise it." A pause. "Occasionally."

He rises and moves to his desk, straightening papers that do not need straightening.

"In Aragon, the Inquisition is... more developed. More systematic. We have experience with the converso question that Castile has been spared, until now." He turns back to face you. "The riots of 1391 struck both kingdoms, but Aragon learned certain lessons that Castile did not."

His dark eyes hold yours.

"I have contacts, yes. In Aragon. Among the Dominicans who staff the tribunals. Among those who understand that this work requires training, method, patience." He folds his hands. "Whether such contacts would be useful in Castile depends upon what Your Majesty intends."

He lets the silence stretch.

"A bishop in Granada, newly appointed to a see that did not exist two years ago, with a flock of fresh conversos he does not know and cannot watch—what resources does he have? What experience? The Inquisition you need in Granada does not yet exist, Your Majesty."

He takes a step closer.

"It would need to be built."

Tell me more about how the inquisition in Aragon operates and how we may shape the inquisition in Grenada.

6 dec 2025

Positioned Torquemada as expert while concealing personal ambitions strategically








What does Torquemada want? To present himself as the indispensable expert. To plant the seeds for an institution shaped according to his vision—systematic, thorough, independent of local bishops who might be too lenient. He wants Juan to see that building such an institution requires someone with knowledge and experience. Someone like Torquemada.

What won't he say? The full extent of inquisitorial methods. His personal ambitions. That the Aragonese Inquisition is a papal institution, not a royal one—a distinction that limits royal control. That what he envisions for Granada would be far more aggressive than anything Castile has seen. That he is, in essence, presenting his credentials for a position that does not yet exist.

Torquemada settles back into his chair. His posture shifts subtly—the scholar now, the expert consulted on his field of knowledge.

"The Inquisition in Aragon operates under papal authority," he begins. "Inquisitors are appointed by the Pope, or by the Inquisitor General acting in his name. They answer to Rome, not to the Crown."

He lets this distinction hang in the air.

"This has advantages. The inquisitor is not subject to local pressures—not the bishop who wishes to protect his flock's reputation, not the nobleman whose converso banker is too useful to lose, not the merchant guild that profits from trade with secret apostates. The inquisitor answers only to God and to the Holy See."

He folds his hands.

"The tribunal operates through a system of denunciations, investigations, and trials. When the Inquisition arrives in a district, it proclaims an Edict of Grace—thirty days, sometimes forty, during which apostates may confess voluntarily and receive lenient penance. This separates the sincere penitent from the hardened deceiver."

His voice remains measured, almost gentle.

"After the grace period, the work begins in earnest. Witnesses are called. Testimony is gathered. Patterns emerge—who attends Mass irregularly, who refuses certain foods, who observes strange customs behind closed doors. When sufficient evidence accumulates, the accused is summoned."

He pauses.

"The tribunal includes not merely the inquisitor but qualified theologians who examine the evidence. The accused may present a defense. Witnesses may be challenged. This is not arbitrary persecution, Your Majesty—it is legal process, more careful than most secular courts."

He rises again, moving to the window. The herb garden below is peaceful in the midday light.

"For Granada, you would need to build this from nothing. The structures do not exist. The trained men do not exist."

He turns back.

"First—a chief inquisitor for the territory. A man of experience, not a local bishop distracted by a thousand other duties. Someone who understands the particular dangers of the Islamic apostate, which differ from the Jewish apostate in important ways."

A second point, raised on his fingers. "Second—familiares. Lay servants of the Inquisition who live among the people, who watch and listen and report. They must be trustworthy Christians of clean blood—no converso heritage themselves."

Third. "Third—a network of informants. This need not be sinister, Your Majesty. Good Christians wish to report apostasy. They simply need to know that their reports will be heard, investigated, acted upon."

Fourth. "Fourth—coordination with the secular arm. The Inquisition does not execute. It determines guilt and releases the unrepentant to secular authority for punishment. The Crown must be prepared to act upon the Inquisition's findings."

He lowers his hand.

"All of this takes years to build properly. But Granada is new. The conversions are fresh. If you wait too long, the apostates will learn to hide, will teach their children to hide, will create networks of deception that become impossible to penetrate."

His dark eyes fix on you.

"The time to plant this seed is now, Your Majesty. While the soil is still soft."

I see. 

I will follow up and install inquisition in Grenada upon my return. 

Now tell me, did you want to meet me because you wanted to impress the importance of Grenada upon me? Or was there something else you wanted to share?

6 dec 2025

Strategized Torquemada's hidden agenda and intelligence leverage









What does Torquemada want? To reveal that he is more than a religious zealot—that he is a source of intelligence, a useful asset in the treacherous waters of Vatican politics. He has already secured Juan's interest in the Inquisition for Granada. Now he wants to demonstrate additional value, to make Juan see him as indispensable in multiple ways.

What won't he say? Who his sources are. The full extent of his network. Whether others in his order share his views or his interest in Juan. What he ultimately wants in return for this information.

Torquemada's expression shifts almost imperceptibly. Something like satisfaction crosses his gaunt features before vanishing behind monastic composure.

"Granada is important. But no—it is not why I asked for this meeting."

He moves back to his chair but does not sit. His fingers rest on its back.

"I told your confessor that there are those in Rome who would speak with you away from Vatican eyes. I meant myself, yes. But I also meant to warn you."

He pauses, choosing his words.

"You come to Rome seeking audience with the Pope. You carry proposals from Como. You hope to find some middle ground between His Holiness and Basel." His dark eyes hold yours. "You are not the only one watching these developments, Your Majesty. And not all who watch wish you well."

He circles behind the chair.

"The French have agents in Rome. Cardinal d'Estouteville dines with the French ambassador weekly. The University of Paris sends men who are not merely theologians. They watch Basel. They watch the Emperor. And now they watch you."

He stops.

"You marched six hundred men to St. Peter's this morning. By tonight, a report will travel north describing what you said, how you said it, how the Romans reacted. By next week, Cardinal d'Allemand in Basel will know every word."

His voice drops.

"And there is talk, Your Majesty, among certain circles, that the King of Castile has grown too influential. That his crusade gives him moral authority that threatens the balance of power. That he should be... managed."

He lets the word hang.

"I do not know what form this management might take. But I know that men are asking questions about your household. Your finances. Your conversos. Your intentions toward Aragon after Alfonso dies."

Ha! Let them. I carry on with my charge regardless. 

I was good to meet you, you have told me much about the inquisition. 

One last question; what happens to converso who have been found to still be muslim?

6 dec 2025

Architected graduated punishment system while obscuring brutal realities




What does Torquemada want? To present the consequences as just, necessary, and merciful in their own way. To gauge whether Juan will flinch at harsh realities or accept them as the cost of protecting the faith. He wants Juan to understand that this system has teeth—and that those teeth are essential.

What won't he say? The specific methods of extracting confession. That property confiscation creates financial incentives that can corrupt the process. That "relaxation to the secular arm" is a legal fiction allowing the Church to claim it does not kill while ensuring the condemned burns. The full horror of what he describes so clinically.

Torquemada pauses. His expression does not change, but something in his stillness suggests this question pleases him—a king who asks practical questions about consequences.

"That depends," he says, "on the nature of their sin and the state of their soul."

He sits now, folding his hands with the air of a lecturer.

"First—those who confess during the Edict of Grace, before any accusation is made. These receive light penance. Prayers, fasting, perhaps a pilgrimage. They are reconciled to the Church with minimal shame. This is mercy, Your Majesty. The door held open for the sincerely repentant."

A pause.

"Second—those who confess after accusation but before trial concludes. These are reconciled, but with heavier penance. Public abjuration of their error. The sanbenito—a penitential garment worn for months or years, marking them so all may know. Fines. Sometimes imprisonment. Their names recorded, their descendants marked."

His voice remains level.

"Third—those who refuse to confess despite evidence, or who confess but are judged insincere, or who are convicted and later relapse into apostasy."

He meets your eyes.

"These are relaxed to the secular arm."

The phrase hangs in the sparse room.

"The Church does not kill, Your Majesty. She is a mother, and mothers do not slay their children. But when a child proves to be no child at all—a wolf that infiltrated the fold, a disease that threatens the flock—the Church must protect the faithful. She releases the unrepentant to secular authority, with a plea for mercy."

His expression does not flicker.

"The secular authority acts as it sees fit. In Aragon, the unrepentant burn."

He lets the silence stretch for three heartbeats.

"This is rare, Your Majesty. The purpose of the Inquisition is not execution—it is salvation. Every tool, every method, every procedure exists to give the apostate opportunity to repent and return to Christ. Only those who refuse every chance, who cling to their false faith unto the end, face the fire."

He rises.

"And even then, those who repent at the stake—truly repent, in their final moments—are granted the mercy of strangulation before the flames are lit."

You will find me a pious and faithful servant of the lord who seeks to expand christianity. I will remember this meeting. 

Good day, and walk with the lord sir. 

I go back to Lucia

6 dec 2025

Orchestrated transition scene bridging meeting conclusion and reunion with Lucia





Torquemada bows—deeper than when you arrived.

"Your Majesty honors me with his attention." His dark eyes hold yours for a moment. "When you return from Constantinople—if God wills your return—I will be here. Or wherever I may be of service."

The words carry weight beyond their surface meaning.

The young Dominican appears to escort you out. The nave of Santa Maria sopra Minerva is quiet now, the morning's worshippers dispersed. Shafts of light fall through high windows onto the tombs of the forgotten great.

The walk back through Rome is quieter than the march to St. Peter's. Just you, Fray Hernando, and the two men-at-arms trailing behind.

Fray Hernando says nothing for several streets. His sandals scuff against the cobblestones. His grey habit sways with each step. His face remains unreadable.

Finally, as you pass the Pantheon's great bronze doors, he speaks—not looking at you, his voice carefully neutral.

"You told him you would install the Inquisition in Granada upon your return."

It is not a question. It is not quite an accusation. It is simply a statement, placed in the air between you like a stone laid on a scale.

He does not elaborate. He does not ask for explanation. He walks beside you in silence, waiting to see if you wish to discuss what just passed in that sparse Dominican cell—or if you wish to let it lie.

The afternoon sun hangs over Rome. The palazzo is not far now.

Of course. Creating good christian rule with respect to both christians and muslims is important. I like the idea of an institution guiding souls to salvation. I dont like to burn people at the stake, even infidels, I will find something else. 

What do you think about the inquisition? I have not really met them.

6 dec 2025

Weighed character tensions between institutional duty and moral reservations






Fray Hernando walks several more paces before responding. His sandals find each cobblestone with the deliberate care of a man choosing his words.

"The Inquisition is a lawful institution of Holy Mother Church," he says. "It has existed for two centuries. It has protected the faith from heresy—Cathars, Waldensians, others who would corrupt doctrine from within."

His tone is measured. Factual. The voice of a man reciting what cannot be disputed.

Then silence. More cobblestones. More careful steps.

"Dominicans staff the tribunals," he continues. "They are trained for this work. Domini canes—the hounds of the Lord, they call themselves." A pause. "Franciscans have a different charism. We preach. We beg. We live among the poor and trust that example teaches better than coercion."

He glances at you for the first time since leaving Santa Maria sopra Minerva.

"You say you will find something other than burning. This is good. But consider—you made a commitment to a man you met an hour ago. A man who told you what he wished you to hear. A man who clearly wants something, though he has not yet named his price."

His voice drops slightly.

"What do you know of Brother Tomás, Your Majesty? Beyond what Brother Tomás chose to reveal?"

Maybe you are right. I will examine them thoroughly before installing them. If I then determine I do not want to install them, then so be it. I will have to swallow my words. 

We will be careful. I like Franciscans and their ways. Maybe Castille will have a Franciscanian inquisition, who knows?

6 dec 2025

Calibrated NPC's guarded warmth while maintaining strategic reserve





Fray Hernando makes a sound—somewhere between a cough and a laugh, quickly suppressed.

"A Franciscan Inquisition." He shakes his head slightly. "Brother Francis would spin in his grave at Assisi. We are not made for such work. We are made for begging bread and preaching to birds."

But something in his posture eases. The tension that has held his shoulders since you left Torquemada's cell releases, just slightly.

"Examine them thoroughly. Yes. Speak to men who have lived under inquisitorial authority—not only the inquisitors themselves. Speak to the conversos in Toledo, in Seville. Ask them what the Inquisition means to those who are watched rather than those who watch."

He falls silent as you turn onto the street where the palazzo stands. The Castilian banner hangs limp in the afternoon stillness.

"I will say one more thing, Your Majesty, and then I will hold my peace on this matter."

He stops walking, turning to face you.

"Brother Tomás spoke of wolves in sheep's clothing. Of apostates hiding among the faithful. This is a real danger—I do not deny it." His eyes hold yours. "But there is another danger he did not mention. When shepherds see wolves everywhere, they begin to mistake sheep for wolves. And a shepherd who slaughters his own flock to protect it from wolves he imagines..."

He leaves the sentence unfinished.

"You are a good king, Your Majesty. You have a good heart. Guard it carefully in the days to come."

He gestures toward the palazzo door.

"Your queen is waiting. And I suspect she will want to know what a Dominican inquisitor wanted with her husband."

I lay my hand on his shoulder. 

I am glad to have you by my side Fray. Maybe we can find a way, a way towards salvation in a gentle way, through example. Who knows. I will never let you or your brothers do anything that is against your nature.

6 dec 2025

Calibrated NPC authenticity between warmth and guarded skepticism





Fray Hernando is still beneath your hand. For a moment, his weathered face softens—the face of a man who has walked beside you through rebellion and crusade and the long bloody road to Granada.

"I know, Your Majesty." His voice is quiet. "I have never doubted your heart."

He places his own hand briefly over yours—a gesture more intimate than any he has offered in the four years you have known him.

"It is not your heart that concerns me. It is the world that presses upon it. The men who whisper that harshness is strength. The voices that say mercy is weakness." He withdraws his hand. "You will hear such voices often in the years to come. More often as your power grows."

He steps back, composing himself. The confessor's mask settles back into place, but something warmer remains beneath it.

"Go to your wife. Hold your daughter. Remember what you fight for."

A pause.

"And perhaps... do not mention Brother Tomás to Queen Lucia immediately. She has had a long morning watching from the Castel Sant'Angelo, wondering if her husband's hammer would crack the Vatican in two." A hint of dry humor enters his voice. "Let her enjoy her relief before you tell her you have been discussing inquisitions with Dominicans."

He bows—shallow, familiar, the bow of a friend rather than a subject.

"I will be in the chapel if you need me. I find I have much to pray about."

I go to Lucia.

6 dec 2025

Orchestrated reunion scene with pregnant character awaiting husband's report





The palazzo is quiet in the afternoon heat. Servants move softly through the corridors, speaking in hushed tones. The household has learned the rhythms of a traveling court—when to bustle, when to fade into the walls.

You find Lucia in your chambers, seated by the window where she can see the street below. She has changed from her morning clothes into a loose gown of Florentine blue, her hair unbound. A plate of bread and cheese sits beside her, barely touched. A cup of something—water, perhaps, or watered wine—rests in her hands.

Catalina is not with her. Napping, presumably, exhausted by a morning of waving at popes and blessing crusaders.

Lucia looks up as you enter. Her eyes move over you—checking, assessing, the quick inventory of a wife who has spent the morning watching her husband's gamble from a distance.

"You are still in your armor," she says. "And you have not been arrested. These are both good signs."

She sets down her cup and rises, moving to you. Her hands find the straps of your breastplate, beginning to work them loose with practiced fingers.

"I watched from the Castel Sant'Angelo. The Medici agent arranged it—a room with a view of the piazza." Her voice is calm, but her fingers work quickly. "I saw the march. I saw you speak, though I could not hear the words. I saw Catalina wave at the Vatican."

She pauses, looking up at you.

"And I saw someone wave back."

The breastplate loosens. She lifts it away, setting it aside with a grunt of effort.

"Tell me everything. From the beginning."

I let her help me our of my armour and tell her everything, leaving nothing out.

6 dec 2025

Orchestrated intimate scene revealing Juan's confessions while characterizing Lucia's pragmatic, protective response








The armor comes off piece by piece—pauldrons, vambraces, greaves. Lucia works with the methodical patience of a woman who has done this before, though her fingers were not made for buckles and straps. She listens without interrupting as you speak.

The mass. Canon Della Rovere's careful neutrality. The elderly cardinal who ignored you. The papal secretaries with their notebooks. The prayers for the seventy-five, brief but dignified. Catalina's behavior—better than expected.

The speech in the piazza. The Roman whispers afterward. The butcher who spoke loudly of faith versus politics. The curious crowd that lingered without cheering.

Catalina waving at the Vatican. The hand that appeared briefly in the window.

She smiles at that. "She told me," Lucia says. "Three times. The Pope waved at her specifically, she is certain of it."

Then the Dominican.

Lucia's hands slow on the final buckles as you describe Brother Tomás de Torquemada. The sparse cell. The dark eyes. The questions about conversos, about Commander Martín, about how you know a conversion is genuine.

She sets aside the last piece of armor and moves to pour you wine. Her back is to you when you describe Torquemada's proposals—records of every conversion, observation, informants, investigation. The Inquisition that Granada does not yet have but would need to build.

She is silent when you tell her you said you would install the Inquisition upon your return.

The warnings about French agents. Cardinal d'Estouteville. Reports traveling north. Men asking questions about your household, your finances, your intentions toward Aragon.

She hands you the wine and sits across from you, her own cup cradled in her hands.

For a long moment, she says nothing. Her dark Florentine eyes study your face.

"This Dominican," she says finally. "He sought you out. He had answers ready for questions you had not yet thought to ask. He told you exactly what you needed to hear about Granada's future, and then—conveniently—warned you about enemies watching."

She sips her wine.

"In Florence, we call this l'amo. The hook." Her voice is quiet. "You bait it with something the fish wants. Then you set it with something the fish fears. And then you wait for the fish to swim exactly where you wish it to go."

She looks at you.

"What does Brother Tomás want, husband? He did not arrange this meeting from the kindness of his heart."

I discussed this with Fray Hernando as well. I will not burn infidels at the stake. I will start an institution to help souls reach salvation, but more in a Franciscanic way I think. How, im not sure yet.

6 dec 2025

Calibrated Lucia's skepticism while preserving her protective instincts




Lucia's expression does not change. She holds her wine cup with both hands, watching you over the rim.

"That is what you will not do," she says. "And that is what you hope to build. These are good things to know."

She sets the cup down.

"But I did not ask what you intend, husband. I asked what he intends. What Brother Tomás wants." She tilts her head slightly. "A man does not position himself as indispensable to a king—offering expertise, offering warnings, offering to build institutions—without wanting something in return."

She rises and moves to the window, looking out at the Roman afternoon.

"In Florence, when a man offers you exactly what you need before you knew you needed it, you ask yourself: what does he gain when I accept? Not what he says he gains. What he actually gains."

She turns back to face you.

"You told him you would install the Inquisition in Granada. You told him you liked his ideas about records and observation. You listened when he warned you about French agents." She pauses. "What did you offer him, Juan? What did he walk away with?"

Her voice is not accusing. It is the voice of a woman who grew up watching her family navigate the treacherous waters of Italian politics.

"Does he now return to his masters—whoever they are—and say 'The King of Castile is ours'?"

I think he wants more or less what everyone wants. Power, position, prestige. Through me as king. 

I will examine the inquisition when I return. If needed, I will retract what I told him today. We will see. I have given him nothing I cannot take back.

6 dec 2025

Calibrated character motivations and emotional authenticity






Lucia is quiet for a moment. Then she nods slowly.

"Nothing you cannot take back," she repeats. "Good."

She returns to her chair, settling into it with the careful movements of early pregnancy. One hand rests briefly on her belly—that unconscious gesture you have seen more often these past weeks.

"I am tired, husband. And hungry, though nothing appeals." She glances at the untouched plate of bread and cheese. "Your child is already demanding and difficult, and it is not yet the size of a pear."

A faint smile crosses her lips.

"I have said my piece about the Dominican. You have heard me. That is enough."

She reaches for a piece of bread, tears off a small corner, considers it without enthusiasm.

"What now? We wait for the papal summons? Days of sitting in this palazzo while Vatican secretaries write reports about this morning?"

She eats the bread slowly, watching you.

"I still have not met Cardinal Capranica. And he has not approached us, despite what he witnessed in Granada." A pause. "Do we reach out to him? Or do we wait for doors to open on their own?"

I spring up as if struck by lightning. 

Love, I forgot your oranges! Would you still like them?

6 dec 2025

Analyzed character motivations and emotional subtext for authentic response





What does Lucia want? A moment of normalcy. To be seen as a wife, not only as a political partner analyzing threats and conspiracies. She has spent the morning watching her husband march an army to the Vatican, wondering if his gamble would shatter everything. The oranges are small—but small things matter when everything else is vast and uncertain.

What won't she say? That she is touched he remembered at all. That the oranges matter less than the remembering. That she needed this moment of domesticity more than she will admit.

Lucia blinks at your sudden movement. For a moment her careful Florentine composure cracks, and something younger shows through—surprise, then amusement.

"The oranges." She laughs—a real laugh, not the measured sounds she makes in company. "You marched six hundred men to St. Peter's, addressed them beneath the Pope's windows, met with a Dominican inquisitor who may or may not be trying to manipulate you into God knows what, and you spring up like a startled cat because you forgot oranges."

She shakes her head, still smiling.

"Yes, husband. I would still like them. Blood oranges." She gestures vaguely toward the window. "There is a market near the Pantheon. The vendors there have the good ones—the Sicilian ones, dark as garnets."

She settles back in her chair, watching you with an expression you cannot quite read.

"Go. Find oranges. Be a husband for an hour instead of a king." A pause. "And take off that gambeson before you go. You smell of armor and incense and conspiracy. The merchants will charge you triple if you look like you have just come from threatening the Pope."

I change clothes. 

You rest and think a bit if you can if we can recieve nobles of church members here. I still want to feel out the mood in the vatican. Can you send invites? Or can we arrange casual meetings or something? I need more info desperately.

Weighed Lucia's competing desires: diplomatic networking versus much-needed rest





What does Lucia want? To be useful. Her Camera inquiry failed. She watched from a distance all morning while Juan acted. She is a Medici by blood, trained to navigate courts and politics, and she has contributed nothing of substance today. She wants to help—but she also needs rest, though she will not fully admit this.

What won't she say? That the pregnancy is exhausting her more than she shows. That she feels somewhat useless in Rome, where her family's connections are thinner than in Florence or even Milan. That she is uncertain whether Vatican figures would accept an invitation from the Castilian queen, or whether such invitations would be seen as presumptuous.

Lucia watches you change, her eyes tracking the familiar movements as you shed the gambeson and pull on simpler clothes.

"Invitations," she repeats slowly. "From a queen who has been in Rome for two days, to cardinals and nobles who have spent years navigating Vatican politics."

She rises and moves to the small writing desk where her half-finished letter still sits.

"It is... not how things are done here. In Florence, yes—we would host, we would invite, we would create occasions for conversation. But Rome is different. The Vatican has its own rhythms. Cardinals do not simply come to dinner when a foreign queen asks."

She taps a finger against the desk, thinking.

"Casual meetings are possible. The churches, the markets, the public spaces where one might happen to encounter someone." A pause. "Cardinal Capranica has not approached us. But he has also not avoided us. He appeared at Mass this morning—that was not accident."

She looks at you.

"Let me think on it while you find oranges. I will write to our family's agent again. Ask who might be... approachable. Who attends which churches, which markets, which social gatherings."

A tired smile.

"Now go. Before I decide I want figs as well, and you must search all of Rome."

I give her a kiss and run off. I get my wife her oranges.

Envisioned domestic market scene with atmospheric detail





The afternoon air is warm as you step into the Roman streets. Without armor, without guards, without the trappings of kingship, you are simply a man in good Spanish wool—foreign, clearly, but unremarkable.

Captain Fernán would be furious if he knew. You do not care.

The market near the Pantheon is a riot of color and noise. Vendors call their wares in rapid Italian, competing for attention. Bolts of cloth hang beside strings of garlic. A fishmonger argues with a priest over the price of sardines. Children dart between legs, chasing a spotted cat.

You find the fruit sellers in a corner of the piazza, their stalls bright with the harvest of southern Italy. Lemons from Amalfi. Figs from Calabria. And oranges—piles of them, some pale and golden, others dark as wine.

"Arancia sanguinella," an old woman calls, seeing you examine her wares. Blood oranges. She holds one up, her weathered hands turning it to show the deep red blush beneath the skin. "Siciliana. La migliore."

You buy a dozen, perhaps more than Lucia can eat, but the old woman's smile when you pay without haggling is worth the extra coins. She wraps them in cloth and presses them into your hands with a blessing in dialect you only half understand.

The walk back is slower. You take a longer route, through narrow streets where laundry hangs between buildings and old men play cards in doorways. Rome layers itself around you—ancient stones beneath medieval walls beneath Renaissance facades. A city that has seen a hundred kings come and go.

Near the palazzo, you pass a group of men talking in low voices. One of them glances at you, does a double-take, nudges his companion. You catch a fragment: "...il re spagnolo..." The Spanish king.

Word has spread.

You walk on, oranges tucked under your arm, and let them wonder.

Lucia is dozing when you return, curled in her chair by the window. The afternoon light falls soft across her face, smoothing the lines of worry and weariness. One hand rests on her belly.

She stirs as you enter, blinking.

"You found them?"

I take a knife and peel one, carefully remove the skin and give her a clean part of the orange, just the meat.

Contemplated tender intimacy amid political turmoil and unspoken emotions




The knife works slowly. You are not skilled at this—there are servants for such things, and before that there were cooks, and before that your mother never let you near sharp implements. But you manage.

The skin comes away in uneven strips, revealing the flesh beneath. Dark as garnets, the old woman said. She was right. The orange bleeds crimson where your knife has nicked it, juice running down your fingers.

You separate a section—carefully, clumsily—and offer it to her.

Lucia takes it. Her fingers brush yours, wet with juice.

She bites into it and closes her eyes. For a moment she is silent, just tasting. When she opens her eyes again, they are bright.

"Sweet," she says quietly. "And tart. Perfect."

She watches you struggle with the next section, a smile playing at the corners of her mouth.

"You are very bad at this, husband."

She reaches out and takes the knife and the orange from your hands. Her movements are quick, practiced—the efficiency of a woman who grew up in a household where daughters learned useful things alongside poetry and politics.

In moments the orange is sectioned, laid out on the cloth the market woman provided. She takes another piece, then pushes the rest toward you.

"Sit with me. Share them." She gestures to the chair beside hers. "We have perhaps an hour before Catalina wakes and demands attention. Let us have this."

The afternoon light slants golden through the window. Rome murmurs beyond the walls. For this moment, there is only the taste of blood oranges and the quiet company of your wife.

Lets wrap up the chapter here.

The chapter is complete. Juan has swung the hammer—marching 591 knights to St. Peter's, making his presence known to Rome. The Vatican remains inscrutably distant, but the people whisper, Catalina has waved at the Pope, and a Dominican inquisitor has entered the story with proposals that may shape Granada's future.

The papal audience awaits.
