Chapter 2.34 ended on March 27, 1435 at dawn, with Juan and Isaac de Baeza having just completed the Chrysobull of the United Treasury—a document that would effectively give Juan control of Byzantine finances while preserving the Emperor's dignity and providing him a generous stipend. Juan is now preparing to present this to Emperor John VIII.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.35: The Chrysobull\n\n\nMarch 27, 1435\nPalace of Blachernae, Constantinople\n\n\n\nThe first pale light of dawn crept over the rooftops of Constantinople, turning the eastern horizon from black to grey to palest gold. From the private courtyard of Juan's quarters in the Blachernae, the city's minarets and church domes alike caught that light—a forest of spires silhouetted against the brightening sky, some crowned with crosses, some with crescents.\n\n\nIsaac de Baeza set down his quill and flexed his fingers. The parchment before them bore the fruits of a sleepless night: the Chrysobull of the United Treasury, written in both Latin and Greek, the parallel columns of text precise and elegant despite the haste of their creation.\n\n\n\"It is done, Majesty.\" Isaac's voice carried the hoarseness of exhaustion, but his dark eyes remained sharp. \"Six articles. Clean language. Nothing the Emperor can misunderstand, nothing he can claim was hidden from him.\" He tapped the succession clause—Article V. \"And this is the heart of it. When the Palaiologos line fails—when, not if—the Defensor assumes not merely the treasury but 'all obligations, ceremonies, institutions, and dignities.' Everything except the title itself.\"\n\n\nA servant had brought warm water and fresh bread sometime in the small hours. The bread lay untouched. Isaac had drunk his fill; Juan had not.\n\n\nBeyond the courtyard walls, the city was stirring. The faint calls of fishermen carried up from the Golden Horn. Somewhere a rooster crowed, answered by another, then another—a chain of waking sounds spreading through the Latin and Greek quarters alike.\n\n\n\"The Emperor will have risen for morning prayers by now,\" Isaac continued, rolling the parchment carefully. \"Patriarch Joseph keeps him to the ancient schedule. Matins at dawn, then a light meal, then audiences begin. If you wish to catch him before others fill his ears...\" He let the implication hang.\n\n\nThe document itself was beautiful—Isaac had seen to that. Byzantine conventions required such things: the precise gold-leaf borders that would be added by imperial scribes, the spaces for the Emperor's crimson signature and the great seal of the Palaiologoi. Form mattered in Constantinople. It always had.\n\n\nBut the substance...\n\n\nTwenty-two thousand florins a year. The income of a prosperous kingdom. And in exchange, the Emperor would sign away control of every hyperper that flowed through his treasury, every talent of silver, every customs duty, every tax. He would retain his purple robes, his ceremonies, his titles. He would not retain his power.\n\n\nIsaac had called it the best bargain Juan had ever made. But bargains required two parties willing to agree.\n\n\nThe sky continued to brighten. Somewhere in the palace, in the imperial apartments that had housed Caesars for a thousand years, John VIII Palaiologos was waking to another day as Emperor of the Romans.\n\n\nAnd soon, he would have to decide what that title was truly worth."

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed emperor's psychological response to treasury proposal.\n\nJuan is going to present the Chrysobull of the United Treasury to Emperor John VIII. This is a massive moment - he's essentially asking the Emperor to sign away control of his treasury in exchange for a guaranteed stipend and the preservation of his dignity and titles.\n\nI need to think about how Emperor John would react to this. Let me consider:\n\n1. John's situation:\n- He's 43, childless after three marriages\n- His empire is dying - he knows this\n- He's desperate for Western aid but has been burned before\n- He's proud of his lineage but pragmatic\n- Juan has already proven himself - the muster showed nearly 6,000 men, the settlement campaign is working, the Ottoman truce gives them 10 years\n- Juan just revealed the Ottoman truce to the merchants - that's huge\n- The naval reconstruction is funded and beginning\n\n2. John's psychology:\n- He signed the Apokatastasis already\n- He named Juan \"Defensor Romaniae\"\n- But this is different - this is signing away actual control of the treasury\n- This makes Juan effectively the ruler of Constantinople in all but name\n- John has brothers who might object (especially Constantine, who is capable and respected)\n\n3. What would John think about this proposal?\n- On one hand: Juan has delivered. Real soldiers, real money, real results.\n- On the other hand: This is the end of Byzantine independence in any meaningful sense\n- The stipend is generous - 22,000 florins is more than he's seen in years\n- But it's also... humiliating? To become a pensioner in his own empire?\n\n4. Historical context:\n- Byzantine emperors have been figurehead before (under regents, under powerful families)\n- But never under a foreign king\n- This is unprecedented\n- John might see it as the only way to save Constantinople\n- Or he might see it as the final betrayal of his ancestors\n\nI should play this carefully. John is not stupid. He'll understand exactly what this document means. The question is whether he'll sign it.\n \nThe imperial apartments will become a stage of delicate negotiation. Juan will approach with calculated precision, understanding the weight of this moment. Every gesture, every word will be measured. John will likely scrutinize Juan's demeanor, searching for any hint of triumph or manipulation. The document represents more than a financial arrangement - it's a symbolic transfer of power, a last desperate attempt to preserve the remnants of Byzantine sovereignty.\n\nI sense the fragility of this diplomatic encounter. John must weigh survival against potential humiliation, knowing Constantinople's fate hangs in the balance. His response will reveal everything about his character and the empire's final moments.\n\n\nThe walk from Juan's quarters to the imperial apartments took him through corridors that had witnessed a thousand years of Byzantine intrigue. Mosaic saints watched from walls darkened by centuries of incense smoke. Guards in antiquated armor—ceremonial now, their real purpose long since supplanted by the Military Orders—straightened as the Defensor Romaniae passed.\n\n\nIsaac had remained behind. \"This conversation should have no witnesses who might be compelled to testify later,\" he had said. \"Whatever the Emperor says, whatever you say—let it be between kings alone.\"\n\n\nThe imperial chamberlain, a thin Greek with the perpetually worried expression of a man who had served too many masters in too uncertain a time, received Juan in the antechamber. His bow was deep, genuinely respectful—the Defensor had transformed this man's world as much as anyone's.\n\n\n\"His Imperial Majesty has completed morning prayers, Defensor. He takes his breakfast now. If you would wait, I shall—\"\n\n\n\"Tell him I come on a matter that cannot wait. Tell him I bring a document that will secure Constantinople's future.\"\n\n\nThe chamberlain's eyes flickered to the rolled parchment in Juan's hand. He bowed again and disappeared through doors of ancient cedar, carved with eagles that had once symbolized dominion over half the world.\n\n\nThe wait was brief. Whatever John VIII Palaiologos had become, he was not a man who avoided difficult conversations.\n\n\n\nThe Emperor's private breakfast chamber was modest by imperial standards—a small room overlooking a garden gone wild with neglect, its fountain dry, its paths overgrown. John sat at a simple table, a plate of olives and bread before him, a cup of watered wine untouched. He wore no purple this morning, only a plain robe of dark blue wool. He looked tired. He always looked tired.\n\n\n\"Defensor.\" The Emperor gestured to a chair across from him. \"You bring documents at dawn. This is either very good news or very bad.\"\n\n\nJuan sat. He placed the parchment on the table between them but did not unroll it.\n\n\n\"Neither, Majesty. Or perhaps both. It depends on how you see what I am about to propose.\"\n\n\nJohn's dark eyes—Byzantine eyes, the eyes of emperors stretching back to Constantine the Great—studied Juan's face. \"You have given me soldiers, gold, settlers, and a ten-year peace with the Sultan. You have asked little in return. Too little, I have sometimes thought. A man who gives so much and asks so little is either a saint or a man who intends to ask for everything at once.\" A thin smile. \"You are many things, Juan of Castile. I do not think you are a saint.\"\n\n\n\"I am not.\"\n\n\n\"Then ask. Whatever it is, ask. I would rather know than wonder.\"\n\n\nJuan unrolled the parchment, turning it so the Emperor could read the Greek column. He said nothing while John's eyes moved down the text, watching the older man's face as understanding slowly dawned.\n\n\nThe Emperor read in silence. His expression did not change—he had been trained from childhood to show nothing—but his hand, resting on the table, slowly closed into a fist.\n\n\nWhen he finished, he did not look up immediately. He stared at Article V for a long moment. All obligations, ceremonies, institutions, and dignities.\n\n\n\"You have written my abdication,\" John VIII said quietly. \"In everything but name.\"\n\n\nHe raised his eyes to meet Juan's. There was no anger there. No outrage. Only a terrible, weary clarity—the look of a man who had always known this moment would come, and had hoped only that it would not come in his lifetime.\n\n\n\"Twenty-two thousand florins a year. A comfortable retirement for an emperor of nothing.\" His voice was flat. \"My ancestors ruled from the Pillars of Hercules to the Euphrates. And I am to become your pensioner.\"\n\n\nThe garden outside was silent. Even the birds seemed to have stopped singing.\n\n\n\"Tell me, Defensor.\" The title carried a new weight now—ironic, perhaps bitter. \"Why should I sign this? Why should I not simply take what you have given, wait for you to sail home, and rule my city as my fathers did?\""

This is a respectful, patient approach.

I shall inform him of your presence, Defensor. Please, make yourself comfortable.\"\n\n\nHe gestured toward a small alcove furnished with cushioned benches, positioned where morning light fell through a window of thick, greenish glass. The view looked out over the Golden Horn, where the first fishing boats were already returning with their catches, their sails catching the early light.\n\n\nJuan waited.\n\n\nThe antechamber saw a steady trickle of traffic as the hour passed. Servants bearing linens. A priest in Orthodox vestments, nodding respectfully as he passed. Two scribes laden with scrolls, speaking in rapid Greek too low to overhear. The ordinary machinery of an imperial court that had shrunk from governing half the world to administering a single city—but which still maintained the forms, the rituals, the careful choreography of power.\n\n\nNone approached him. Word had spread, perhaps, that the Defensor waited on imperial pleasure. Or perhaps they simply had nothing to say to the Latin king who had transformed their world and might yet transform it further.\n\n\nThe sun climbed. The shadows shortened.\n\n\nFinally, the cedar doors opened, and the chamberlain emerged.\n\n\n\"His Imperial Majesty will receive you now, Defensor.\" Another bow. \"He is in the garden study. I am to bring you myself.\"\n\n\nHe led Juan through a series of smaller chambers, each more intimate than the last, until they reached a door that opened onto a courtyard garden—overgrown, its fountain dry, but still retaining traces of former elegance. Beneath an ancient fig tree, at a table scattered with documents, sat John VIII Palaiologos.\n\n\nThe Emperor wore no purple this morning. A plain robe of dark wool. No crown, no regalia. He looked up as Juan approached, his dark eyes unreadable.\n\n\n\"Defensor.\" He gestured to the chair across from him. \"Sit. You have been patient this morning, which tells me whatever you bring is important enough that you did not wish to seem desperate.\" A thin smile, tired but genuine. \"I appreciate the courtesy. It is rarer than it should be.\"\n\n\nHe waited."

      "say": "Thought process: Identified persuasion attempt and consulted skill documentation.\n\nThe user is correct - this is a persuasion attempt. Juan is trying to convince Emperor John VIII to sign the Chrysobull of the United Treasury, which would effectively give Juan control over Byzantine finances while providing the Emperor with a generous stipend.\n\nI need to consult the persuasion_skill.md to build an appropriate d100 table. Let me search for it.\n\n\nView: Reading the persuasion skill document to build the d100 table\n\n\nThought process: Weighed persuasion success against imperial pride and financial realities.\n\nThis is a significant persuasion attempt. Juan is asking Emperor John VIII to sign the Chrysobull of the United Treasury, which would effectively give Juan control over Byzantine finances while providing the Emperor with a generous stipend of 22,000 florins.\n\nLet me analyze this carefully:\n\n**THE ASK**: Sign a document that merges the Byzantine treasury with Castilian operations, gives the Defensor full administrative control, provides the Emperor a 22,000 florin annual stipend, and includes a succession clause that transfers \"all obligations, ceremonies, institutions, and dignities\" to the Defensor if the Palaiologos line fails.\n\n**IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?**\n\nThis is a huge ask. John VIII would be signing away control of his empire's finances. However, let me consider the context:\n\n1. The Byzantine treasury is effectively empty - Juan has been funding everything\n2. Without Juan's support, Constantinople likely falls within years\n3. John has no sons, and his line is likely to fail anyway\n4. Juan has already proven his commitment through massive investment\n5. The Emperor gets a guaranteed income far exceeding what Byzantine revenues could provide\n6. He retains all titles, honors, and dignity\n7. This is framed as practical administrative efficiency, not humiliation\n\n**JUAN'S APPROACH**:\n- Waited respectfully until the Emperor was ready (shows respect)\n- Framed as solving a practical problem, not a power grab\n- Emphasized that gifts are insulting/burdensome - this is more dignified\n- Mentioned infrastructure, fleet, defenses - things the Emperor cares about\n- Offered the stipend as restoring imperial dignity\n- Asked for the Emperor's opinion - treating him as a partner, not a vassal\n- Did NOT pressure or demand\n\n**SUCCESS FACTORS**:\n1. **Juan has proven his commitment** - soldiers, gold, settlers, 10-year Ottoman truce\n2. **The Byzantine treasury is empty** - John cannot fund anything himself\n3. **Juan has already been paying for everything** - this just formalizes reality\n\n\n4. **22,000 florins is generous** - far more than Byzantine revenues provide\n5. **John's line is failing** - no sons, unlikely to change; the succession clause may actually appeal to him as ensuring continuity\n6. **Constantinople's survival depends on Juan** - without him, the city falls\n7. **Juan's approach is respectful** - waited, asked his opinion, framed as partnership\n8. **Imperial dignity preserved** - all titles, ceremonies, honors retained\n9. **Face-saving framing** - \"merged treasuries\" not \"I take\"\n\nThe proposal strategically addresses multiple Byzantine vulnerabilities. Juan offers financial stability, imperial preservation, and personal dignity for John VIII. By presenting the Chrysobull as a collaborative solution rather than a conquest, he transforms a potential humiliation into an opportunity for imperial continuity.\n\nPotential failure risks emerge from deep psychological and political wounds. The prospect of ceding power triggers profound imperial anxieties: memories of Latin betrayal, loss of ancestral control, and potential familial disapproval. John would perceive this as more than a financial transaction - it's an existential threat to his identity and legacy.\n\nThe succession clause particularly threatens John's autonomy. By positioning Juan as heir, the agreement transforms from a financial arrangement to a fundamental restructuring of imperial power. Brothers like Constantine and Demetrios might view this as outright treachery, further complicating the delicate political landscape.\n\nTrust remains precarious. Despite Juan's respectful approach, John must wrestle with fundamental questions: Can he truly rely on promised stipends? Will his dignity remain intact? These uncertainties amplify the psychological burden of potential surrender.\n\nJohn's pragmatic nature emerges critically. As a ruler already accustomed to painful compromises, he understands survival demands swallowing pride. His impending papal negotiations for a crusade demonstrate remarkable flexibility.\n\nThe proposed arrangement isn't straightforward treasury seizure, but a strategic partnership offering guaranteed income. Yet the succession clause represents a profound threat to imperial autonomy.\n\nPotential outcomes range from outright refusal to conditional agreement. John's realistic options are stark: continue accepting thinly veiled charity or formalize an arrangement already de facto in place. His dynasty's survival hinges on this delicate negotiation.\n\nThe decision matrix suggests nuanced possibilities, with relationship preservation and strategic adaptation as key considerations. John must carefully weigh immediate survival against long-term imperial dignity.\n\n\n\nPERSUASION ANALYSIS: THE CHRYSOBULL OF THE UNITED TREASURY\n\n\n\nThe Ask\n\n\nJuan requests that Emperor John VIII sign the Chrysobull of the United Treasury, which would:\n\n\nMerge all Byzantine and Castilian Eastern revenues into a single treasury\n\nGive the Defensor (or his appointed Sakellarios) full administrative authority\n\nProvide the Emperor a guaranteed 22,000 florin annual stipend in perpetuity\n\nInclude a succession clause transferring \"all obligations, ceremonies, institutions, and dignities\" to the Defensor if the Palaiologos line fails\n\n\n\nApproach Evaluation\n\n\nStrengths of Juan's Approach:\n\n\nWaited respectfully for the Emperor's convenience (honors dignity)\n\nFramed as solving a practical problem, not a power grab\n\nEmphasized that continued gifts are \"insulting\" to the Empire—this reframes dependency as partnership\n\nHighlighted concrete benefits: fleet construction, infrastructure, defenses\n\nOffered the stipend as restoring imperial dignity, not charity\n\nAsked for the Emperor's opinion—treating him as a partner with agency\n\nNo pressure, no demands, no ultimatums\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n\nDid not explicitly address the succession clause (Article V), which is the most alarming element\n\nDid not offer the Emperor input on the Sakellarios appointment\n\nDid not acknowledge the pain of what he's asking\n\n\n\nFactor Analysis\n\n\nSuccess Factors\n\nFactor\nWeight\nNotes\nJuan has proven commitment\nStrong\nSoldiers, gold, settlers, Ottoman truce—years of investment\nByzantine treasury is empty\nStrong\nJohn cannot fund anything independently\nThis formalizes existing reality\nModerate\nJuan already pays for everything\n22,000 florins exceeds current imperial income\nModerate\nGenerous stipend\nJohn's line is failing\nModerate\nNo sons; brothers' lines also struggling\nConstantinople's survival depends on Juan\nStrong\nWithout him, the city likely falls\nRespectful approach\nModerate\nWaited, asked opinion, partnership framing\nImperial dignity preserved in language\nModerate\nTitles, ceremonies, honors retained\nFace-saving framing\nModerate\n\"Merged treasuries\" not \"I take control\"\nJohn is a pragmatist\nModerate\nHas swallowed pride before for survival\nThe alternative is worse\nModerate\nContinued visible dependency or collapse\n\nFailure Factors\n\nFactor\nWeight\nNotes\nEffective abdication of real power\nVery Strong\nTreasury = power; this makes him a figurehead\nImperial pride / thousand-year tradition\nStrong\nRoman Emperors do not become pensioners\n1204 trauma\nModerate\nLatins stripped Constantinople once before\nLoss aversion (2:1 rule)\nStrong\nGiving up control hurts twice as much\nIdentity as actual ruler\nStrong\nEven diminished, he rules; this ends that\nSuccession clause = Juan takes empire\nVery Strong\nJohn isn't stupid; he sees this\nBrothers' reactions\nModerate\nConstantine especially would be horrified\nGreek court opposition\nModerate\nPatriarch, nobles will be outraged\nSets irreversible precedent\nModerate\nOnce signed, cannot be undone\nTrust concerns\nModerate\nWill stipend actually be paid? For how long?\n\n\nFactor Balance Assessment\n\n\nThis is a genuinely difficult ask. Juan's approach is good—respectful, well-framed, offering real benefits. But he is asking an Emperor to sign away the substance of imperial power while retaining only its forms.\n\n\nKey insight: The treasury merger alone might be acceptable—it formalizes existing reality. The succession clause (Article V) is the poison pill. It positions Juan to inherit the empire when the Palaiologos line fails, and John knows his line is failing.\n\n\nJohn VIII is a pragmatist who has swallowed pride before. But there is a difference between begging the Pope for a crusade and signing a document that makes you a pensioned figurehead while a Latin king waits for your dynasty to die out.\n\n\nAssessment: This falls into \"Maybe, under specific conditions.\" Agreement is possible at higher rolls, but even excellent rolls should show John's full awareness of what he's signing and the pain it costs him. The succession clause will likely be the sticking point.\n\n\n\nD100 Resolution Table\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nWounded Refusal. John takes this as confirmation of his worst fears—that Juan's generosity was always a prelude to conquest. The carefully preserved partnership frays. He refuses and asks Juan to leave Constantinople sooner than planned. Relationship damaged; future negotiations will be harder.\n11-25\nDignified Refusal. John understands the practical logic but cannot sign away his treasury and position his replacement. \"You ask me to become a pensioner in my own empire, waiting to die so you can take what remains.\" Refuses firmly but without anger. Relationship preserved; the door remains open.\n26-40\nPartial Opening. John is willing to discuss administrative cooperation but rejects the document as written. The succession clause must go entirely. The Defensor's authority must be advisory, not absolute. He proposes a counter-framework that preserves more imperial agency. Extended negotiation required.\n41-55\nTreasury Yes, Succession No. John accepts the treasury merger and the stipend—these formalize reality. But Article V must be struck or fundamentally rewritten. \"I will not sign my dynasty's death warrant with my own hand.\" Agreement on Articles I-IV possible; Article V becomes a separate, future discussion.\n56-70\nConditional Acceptance. John accepts the full document but extracts significant concessions: consultation rights on major expenditures, a voice in Sakellarios appointment, guarantees about Orthodox Church revenues, and perhaps modifications to Article V's language. Signs with visible reluctance.\n71-85\nResigned Acceptance. John reads the document, understands exactly what it means, and signs. Not because he is fooled, but because he sees no better path. \"You have been more honest with me than most who came bearing gifts. I will not pretend this does not make you master of my treasury. But perhaps a master who builds ships is better than independence that builds nothing.\" Signs with dignity intact but no illusions.\n86-95\nPragmatic Partnership. John accepts and engages constructively. He asks practical questions about implementation, suggests a capable Greek for Sakellarios, discusses how to present this to the court. He has decided to make this work rather than merely endure it. The succession clause still troubles him, but he trusts Juan's intentions—for now.\n96-100\nTrue Partnership. Something in Juan's approach—the respect, the patience, the genuine offer of partnership—breaks through John's defenses. He signs not as a defeated emperor accepting terms, but as a ruler who has found an ally worthy of trust. \"Build your empire, Defensor. I will help you build it. And perhaps, when my line ends, what we have built together will be worth inheriting.\"\n\n\nRoll when ready."

Signs with visible reluctance.\n\nLet me write this scene. The Emperor will engage seriously with the proposal, acknowledge its logic, but push back on specific elements. He should be intelligent, dignified, and realistic about his position—but not a pushover. He sees what Juan is doing but also sees the necessity.\n\nI need to stop when the Emperor asks Juan questions or demands responses, letting the player decide how to handle the negotiations.\n\n\nRoll: 61 — Conditional Acceptance\n\n\n\nThe Emperor read in silence.\n\n\nHis dark eyes moved slowly down the Greek column, pausing at each article. His face—trained from childhood to reveal nothing—remained impassive. But his hand, resting on the stone table beside the untouched bread, slowly closed into a fist.\n\n\nWhen he finished, he did not look up immediately. He read Article V again. Then a third time.\n\n\nThe garden was silent. A sparrow landed on the rim of the dry fountain, considered the two men, and flew away.\n\n\n\"You write well, Defensor.\" John's voice was quiet, measured. \"Or your secretary does. The language is precise. Nothing hidden, nothing obscured. I appreciate that. It would have been easy to bury Article Five in legal formulations. You did not.\"\n\n\nHe set the parchment down and finally met Juan's eyes.\n\n\n\"Let me tell you what I see. Articles One through Four—\" He tapped the document. \"These formalize what already exists. You pay for everything. You command the forces that defend my walls. You fund the fleet that does not yet exist. Pretending otherwise insults us both. A merged treasury administered by the Defensor is... honest. Painful, but honest.\"\n\n\nHe pushed back from the table and stood, moving to the edge of the overgrown garden. His back was to Juan.\n\n\n\"The stipend is generous. Twenty-two thousand florins. More than my treasury has held in years. Enough to maintain the court, the ceremonies, the appearance of empire.\" A pause. \"You have thought carefully about what an emperor needs to remain an emperor in the eyes of his people. I recognize the craft in that.\"\n\n\nHe turned.\n\n\n\"But Article Five.\"\n\n\nThe words hung in the morning air.\n\n\n\"'All obligations, ceremonies, institutions, and dignities.' When my line fails. When, not if.\" John's voice remained controlled, but something harder had entered it. \"You have studied us carefully, haven't you? You know I have no sons. You know my brothers' situations. Theodore is dying. Constantine has no children. Demetrios schemes but produces nothing. Thomas is young, but...\" He shook his head. \"You see the mathematics. You are positioning yourself—or your son—to inherit an empire through a document rather than a war.\"\n\n\nHe walked back to the table, standing across from Juan rather than sitting.\n\n\n\"I am not a fool, Juan of Castile. I have survived twenty years of Ottoman pressure, Genoese manipulation, Venetian calculation, and my own court's endless intrigues. I know what this document is. It is my abdication in all but name, with a sunset clause that makes you my heir.\"\n\n\nHis jaw tightened.\n\n\n\"And yet.\"\n\n\nHe looked out at the ruined garden—the dry fountain, the cracked stones, the weeds growing through what had once been imperial splendor.\n\n\n\"And yet you have done what no Western king has done in two hundred years. You came. You stayed. You bled gold into my city's defenses and asked for nothing but the right to defend Christendom. You negotiated a peace with the Sultan when I could not. You are building me a fleet.\" He exhaled slowly. \"If I refuse this document, what changes? You still control the treasury in practice. You still command the forces. I simply maintain the fiction of independence while depending entirely on your goodwill.\"\n\n\nHe sat down again, heavily.\n\n\n\"I will sign, Defensor. But not this document. Not as written.\"\n\n\nJohn pulled the parchment toward him and produced a small knife from his belt—the kind used for cutting quills. He did not threaten; he simply held it over the document as one might hold a pen.\n\n\n\"Three conditions. First: Article Two. 'Consulted as a matter of courtesy' is insufficient. I will have genuine consultation on expenditures above—\" He considered. \"—five thousand florins. Not a veto. Consultation. I wish to know what is done with the treasury that bears my seal.\"\n\n\nHe looked up, waiting for Juan's response to this first condition before continuing."

      "say": "Thought process: Strategized pragmatic concessions regarding succession clause negotiations.\n\nThe Emperor is making his conditions. Juan has agreed to the first two. Now comes the third - and this will almost certainly be about Article V, the succession clause. This is the heart of John's concerns.\n\nGiven the roll of 61 (Conditional Acceptance), John should accept the document but extract significant concessions. He's not going to demand Article V be struck entirely (that would be more like the 41-55 range), but he will want modifications to its language.\n\nLet me think about what a pragmatic emperor would want changed about Article V. The current language says that if the Imperial line fails, the Defensor assumes \"all obligations, ceremonies, institutions, and dignities.\" This essentially makes Juan (or his heir) the next Emperor in all but name.\n\nWhat modifications might John want?\n1. Perhaps language that makes this more about protecting the empire rather than transferring it\n2. Perhaps some role for the remaining Byzantine nobility or Church in any such transition\n3. Perhaps limitations on what \"dignities\" means - keeping the imperial title itself out of it\n4. Perhaps a requirement that any such succession be confirmed by the Senate or Patriarch\n5. Perhaps language about what happens to surviving Palaiologos family members\n\nGiven John's characterization as pragmatic but proud, he probably won't try to gut Article V entirely (he knows the mathematics of his dynasty). But he'll want to preserve some dignity and some protection for his family's legacy.\n\nI should write John delivering his third condition about Article V, then stop and wait for Juan's response. This is the hardest one - the one that really matters.\n\n\nSomething shifted in the Emperor's bearing. The first two conditions had been practical, administrative—the negotiations of a man accustomed to salvaging what he could. But now he straightened slightly, and when he spoke, his voice carried a different weight.\n\n\n\"Third. Article Five.\"\n\n\nHe did not touch the document. He did not need to. They both knew the words.\n\n\n\"I will not ask you to strike it. You and I both see the mathematics of my dynasty. John the Eighth, childless after three marriages. Theodore dying in the Morea with only a daughter. Constantine—\" A flicker of something crossed his face. Pain, perhaps, or pride. \"Constantine is the best of us. A soldier, a leader, a man who should have been emperor in better times. But his wife is four years dead and he has no children. Demetrios schemes and Thomas is young, but neither has produced sons.\"\n\n\nThe Emperor's voice was steady, almost detached, as if he were discussing someone else's family.\n\n\n\"The Palaiologos line is failing. You see it. I see it. God, in His wisdom, has seen fit to give us daughters and graves where we needed sons. Perhaps that will change. Perhaps Thomas will father a boy who lives, or Constantine will remarry and be blessed. But perhaps not.\"\n\n\nHe leaned forward.\n\n\n\"What I will not do is sign a document that allows a Latin king to claim my empire the moment the last of us stops breathing. 'All obligations, ceremonies, institutions, and dignities'—that is the language of inheritance. That is the language of succession. That makes you or your son the next Emperor of the Romans, and it does so by my own hand and seal.\"\n\n\nJohn's dark eyes held Juan's.\n\n\n\"I propose different language. If—if—the Imperial line fails entirely, with no male heir of the blood surviving, then the Defensor Romaniae assumes guardianship of the empire's obligations and institutions. Guardianship, not ownership. And any assumption of the Imperial dignity itself—the title, the crown, the sacred role—requires confirmation by the Patriarch of Constantinople and acclamation by such nobility and military commanders as remain.\"\n\n\nHe sat back.\n\n\n\"You may find that a hollow distinction. Perhaps it is. But it is the distinction between an emperor who secured his realm's future and an emperor who sold his birthright to a foreign king. It is the distinction I must be able to defend before God when I stand before Him.\"\n\n\nThe garden remained silent. Somewhere beyond the palace walls, the city was waking fully now—the sounds of commerce and life filtering faintly through the morning air.\n\n\n\"These are my conditions, Defensor. Consultation on major expenditures. A voice in the Sakellarios appointment and a Greek deputy. And language in Article Five that preserves—\" He paused, searching for the word. \"—that preserves the form of what we are, even if the substance has long since crumbled.\"\n\n\nHe gestured to the parchment between them.\n\n\n\"Can you accept these terms?\""

I should stop at natural decision points or when NPCs address Juan directly.\n\nLet me write this out properly, keeping it focused and not too long.\n\n\nJohn VIII Palaiologos studied Juan's face for a long moment. Whatever he was searching for, he seemed to find it.\n\n\n\"Unity.\" He spoke the word as if testing its weight. \"My ancestors dreamed of unity—of reuniting Rome and Constantinople, East and West, under one faith and one emperor. They failed. The Crusaders came instead, and unity became a memory of betrayal.\"\n\n\nHe reached for the quill that Isaac had left beside the inkwell.\n\n\n\"Perhaps unity comes not from conquest but from... this. Two men. A document. A choice to trust when trust has been betrayed before.\"\n\n\nThe Emperor signed.\n\n\nHis hand was steady, the crimson ink of the Imperial signature flowing across the parchment in the ancient formula: Ioannes en Christo to Theo pistos Basileus kai Autokrator ton Romaion Palaiologos. John, in Christ the God faithful Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans, Palaiologos.\n\n\nHe set down the quill and pushed the document across the table.\n\n\n\"Your turn, Defensor.\"\n\n\n\nThe signing was witnessed that afternoon in a small ceremony—Kantakouzenos and Sphrantzes for the Greeks, Sotomayor and Philanthropenos representing the Latin presence. No fanfare, no public proclamation. The Chrysobull was a document of administration, not celebration. It would be filed in the Imperial archives, its significance understood by those who needed to understand it.\n\n\nThe days that followed passed quickly.\n\n\nJuan met with Sphrantzes to confirm the shipyard reconstruction timeline. He reviewed the settlement reports with Kantakouzenos—the extraordinary success of the Latin integration continuing, families putting down roots, children learning Greek alongside Castilian. He attended a final service at the Hagia Sophia, standing beside the Emperor as the ancient liturgy echoed through the vast dome.\n\n\nOn the morning of his departure—the last day of March, 1435—Juan found the Emperor waiting at the harbor. John had not been required to come. Protocol did not demand it. But there he stood, in simple robes, watching the Castilian fleet make ready.\n\n\n\"You will return,\" John said. It was not a question.\n\n\nThe Santa Catalina waited at anchor, her sails furled, her crew preparing for the voyage to Rome. The spring wind carried the smell of salt and pitch, of a city that was slowly remembering how to live rather than merely survive.\n\n\n\"I have appointed a man to serve as Greek deputy to whatever Sakellarios you name,\" the Emperor continued. \"Theodoros Metochites. His grandfather served my grandfather. He knows every custom, every precedent, every debt this Empire owes and is owed. He will ensure your man does not... stumble.\"\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\"Travel safely, Juan of Castile. Give my regards to the Holy Father.

The player wants to move forward quickly, so I shouldn't drag this out.\n\nLet me check what's happening in Rome and what Juan needs to do there. From the chapter summaries, he promised to visit Parentucelli (the papal secretary who will become Pope Nicholas V). He also has pending matters with Pope Eugenius IV regarding:\n- Dominican initiative / major donation\n- Papal petition for Inquisition mandate and Military Orders charter\n\nThe voyage from Constantinople to Rome would take some time.

A man of middle years, with the ink-stained fingers of a career clerk and the sharp eyes of someone who had learned that every maravedí told a story, he had managed the Military Orders' accounts in Constantinople for nearly a year. He knew the city. He knew the players. He knew where the money went.\n\n\n\"The Emperor has appointed Theodoros Metochites as your Greek deputy,\" Juan told him. \"He knows the customs, the precedents, the history. Listen to him. Learn from him. But the authority is yours.\"\n\n\nGutiérrez bowed. \"I will not fail you, Majesty.\"\n\n\nMetochites and Gutiérrez met briefly before Juan's departure—two men of ledgers and careful reckoning, taking each other's measure. Whatever passed between them seemed satisfactory. They would learn to work together, or the Joint Treasury would teach them.\n\n\n\nThe voyage to Rome took three weeks.\n\n\nSpring winds carried the Santa Catalina westward through the Aegean, past the scattered islands where fishermen paused in their work to watch the Castilian sails pass. The fleet called briefly at Crete for water and provisions, then pressed on through the Ionian Sea, rounding the boot of Italy and making north along the western coast.\n\n\nJuan used the time as he always did—reading reports, drafting letters, planning for what lay ahead. Rome meant Pope Eugenius IV. It meant the promised visit to Tommaso Parentucelli, the papal secretary whose friendship might prove valuable in years to come. It meant the Dominican initiative, the major donation he had planned, the petition for the Inquisition mandate and the Military Orders charter that still awaited formal approval.\n\n\nAnd it meant news. Three weeks at sea meant three weeks of events unfolding without him. Castile, Portugal, Naples, the Ottoman lands—the world did not pause while kings traveled.\n\n\n\nLate April, 1435\nPort of Ostia, Papal States\n\n\nThe Santa Catalina dropped anchor in the Tiber's mouth on a warm afternoon, the dome of St. Peter's visible in the distant haze. Roman officials met the fleet with the elaborate courtesy due a king who had become the Pope's most valuable ally—the Defensor Romaniae, the conqueror of Granada, the man who had brought a thousand knights to Constantinople's defense.\n\n\nA papal messenger waited on the dock, bearing letters sealed with the fisherman's ring.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" the messenger said, kneeling. \"His Holiness Pope Eugenius rejoices at your safe arrival and bids you welcome to Rome. He asks that you attend him at your earliest convenience. There are... matters of some urgency he wishes to discuss.\"\n\n\nThe messenger's face betrayed nothing, but his choice of words hung in the spring air.\n\n\nMatters of some urgency."

The stop at Crete was brief—fresh water, provisions, news of nothing remarkable. The crews were in good spirits.

This is a prudent decision - prioritizing the health of his people over speed.\n\nI should narrate the journey to Corfu and what they find there. Since this is a change of plans and involves some uncertainty, I might need to consider if another roll is needed - but the skill says to stop at the problem and let Juan respond. He's responded by deciding to go to Corfu. Now I should narrate the journey there and what they encounter.\n\nThe voyage to Corfu is only two days, so it's a short trip. I don't think another chaos roll is needed for such a brief journey. I'll narrate their arrival and the situation they find there.\n\nCorfu in 1435 was under Venetian control. It would have decent facilities as a major Venetian trading post. They would have physicians, supplies, and the ability to care for the sick.\n\nI should narrate:\n1. The fleet turning back\n2. Arrival at Corfu\n3. The reception by Venetian authorities\n4. The status of the illness\n5. Stop at a decision point\n\nLet me write this out.\n\n\nThe order went out within the hour. Signals flew between the ships of the fleet, and the Santa Catalina came about, her sails catching the wind from a new quarter. The other vessels followed, a graceful arc of canvas and timber turning back toward the east.\n\n\nTwo days. Perhaps less, if the winds held.\n\n\n\nCorfu — Venetian Territory\nMid-April, 1435\n\n\nThe island rose from the sea on the morning of the second day—green hills, white buildings, the familiar lion of St. Mark flying from the harbor fortress. Corfu had been Venetian for thirty years now, a waystation for galleys plying the routes between Venice and her eastern possessions. The harbor was busy with merchant traffic, and the arrival of a Castilian royal fleet caused immediate commotion.\n\n\nThe Venetian bailo—the colonial governor—came aboard the Santa Catalina within hours of their anchoring. Marco Barbarigo was a man of middle years, dressed in the sober black of Venetian officialdom, his manner a careful blend of respect and wariness. A Castilian king in Venetian waters was not an everyday occurrence.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty honors Corfu with this visit,\" Barbarigo said, his Castilian accented but fluent. \"Though I confess surprise. We had no word of your coming.\"\n\n\nThe situation was explained. Barbarigo's wariness gave way to genuine concern.\n\n\n\"Illness aboard? You were right to stop. We have physicians here—good ones, trained in Padua. And if it should prove... contagious... better to know now than to carry it to Rome.\" He crossed himself. \"I will send our best doctor to examine the afflicted immediately. In the meantime, Your Majesty and your household are welcome to take lodging ashore. The Castello offers suitable quarters.\"\n\n\nBy evening, the Venetian physician—a grey-bearded man named Alessandro Vendramin—had examined all the sick, including Dona Inês.\n\n\nHe delivered his assessment to Juan in the governor's hall, Barbarigo hovering nearby.\n\n\n\"It is not plague, Majesty. Praise God for that. Nor is it the sweating sickness or typhus.\" Vendramin stroked his beard. \"I believe it to be a ship-fever—a malady that strikes crews on long voyages, particularly when provisions grow stale or water turns. The rash and joint pain are characteristic. With rest, clean water, fresh food, and proper care, most will recover within a week. Perhaps two.\"\n\n\nHe paused.\n\n\n\"The lady Dona Inês concerns me more. She is... not young, and the fever has taken stronger hold. I will do what I can. But I cannot promise.\"\n\n\nBarbarigo stepped forward. \"Your Majesty is welcome to remain in Corfu as long as necessary. Venice and Castile are friends, are we not? The Republic would not see a Christian king stranded with sick men and no aid.\"\n\n\nHis eyes, however, betrayed the calculation beneath the courtesy. A King of Castile, Defensor Romaniae, delayed in Venetian territory. News of this would reach Venice within days. And news, in the Mediterranean, was a currency of its own."

Months, perhaps, before she is truly herself again.\"\n\n\nJuan visited her the following morning. Dona Inês lay propped against pillows in the Venetian guest chamber, her face pale and drawn, her hands trembling as she tried to lift a cup of broth. She was perhaps fifty—one of the older ladies who had accompanied the Portuguese contingent, a widow of good family who had served Queen Leonor for years.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" she whispered, attempting to rise. \"Forgive me.

Fair winds carried the fleet westward, around the boot of Italy and north along the coast. The Santa Catalina dropped anchor in the Tiber's mouth on a warm afternoon, the dome of St. Peter's visible in the distant haze.\n\n\n\nPort of Ostia, Papal States\nLate April, 1435\n\n\nRoman officials met the fleet with elaborate courtesy. A papal messenger waited on the dock, bearing letters sealed with the fisherman's ring.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" The messenger knelt. \"His Holiness Pope Eugenius rejoices at your safe arrival and bids you welcome to Rome. He asks that you attend him at your earliest convenience. There are... matters of some urgency he wishes to discuss.\"\n\n\nThe messenger's face betrayed nothing, but his choice of words hung in the spring air.\n\n\nMatters of some urgency.\n\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

Key events in 1434-1435:\n\n1. **May 1434**: A revolt broke out in Rome, with the Colonna family taking a prominent part. Pope Eugenius IV was forced to flee Rome, disguised as a Benedictine monk. He was pelted with stones and had to hide in a boat. He went to Florence and remained in exile from 1434 to 1443.\n\n2. **June 9, 1435**: The Council of Basel forbade the payment of annates (a major source of papal revenue) and refused any compensation to meet papal expenses.\n\n3. **January 22, 1435**: The Council passed reform decrees against clerical concubinage and regulated excommunication.\n\n4. The Greeks (Byzantine Empire) were negotiating with both the Pope and the Council about where to hold a reunion council. The Greeks preferred an Italian city; the Council wanted Basel or Avignon.\n\n5. The Pope was in exile in Florence, significantly weakened but still fighting.\n\nThis is perfect for the chaos roll. The \"matters of some urgency\" could relate to:\n- The Pope being in exile in Florence (not Rome!)\n- The Council of Basel's increasingly aggressive anti-papal measures\n- The Greek reunion negotiations\n- Queen Giovanna II's impending death and the Naples succession crisis\n- Camera reform progress or setbacks\n\nLet me build a chaos roll table for how things have progressed since Juan left Rome in March 1434 (over a year ago now).\n\n\nNow I have the full picture. This is crucial historical context:\n\n\nKey Historical Events (1434-1435):\n\n\nMay 1434: A revolt broke out in Rome led by the Colonna family. Pope Eugenius IV was forced to flee, disguised as a Benedictine monk, pelted with stones as he escaped down the Tiber. He went into exile in Florence.\n\nJune 9, 1435: The Council of Basel forbade the payment of annates entirely, cutting off a major source of papal revenue.\n\nJanuary 22, 1435: The Council passed further reform decrees against clerical concubinage.\n\nThe Pope has been in exile in Florence since mid-1434—not Rome.\n\nGreek envoys are negotiating with both Pope and Council about where to hold a reunion council.\n\n\nOutstanding Matters from Project Files:\n\n\nJuan promised to visit Parentucelli and make a major Dominican donation\n\nPending: Inquisition mandate, Military Orders charter\n\nQueen Giovanna II expected to die by Autumn 1435 (Naples succession crisis)\n\nCamera reform was just beginning when Juan left\n\n\n\nCHAOS ROLL: Developments in Rome/Florence Since March 1434\n\n\nTime Elapsed: Over one year (March 1434 to late April 1435)\n\n\nSituation: Juan returns expecting to find Pope Eugenius in Rome. In reality, the Pope has been in exile in Florence since May 1434. The Council of Basel has grown more aggressive. The papal-conciliar conflict has intensified.\n\n\nRelevant Factors:\n\n\nPotentially Positive:\n\n\nJuan's alliance with Eugenius was strong when he left\n\nCamera reform was just beginning with Parentucelli\n\nJuan's actions in Constantinople strengthened the crusade narrative\n\nThe Greek reunion negotiations favor the Pope over the Council\n\n\nPotentially Negative:\n\n\nPope was forced into exile—major destabilization\n\nCouncil of Basel has passed aggressive anti-papal measures\n\nOver a year of separation—much can change\n\nNaples succession crisis looming\n\nCamera reform threatened by papal exile and chaos\n\n\n\nd100 Table: State of Papal Affairs\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nCrisis Compounded. The Pope's exile has shattered the Camera reform. Parentucelli has been sidelined or worse. The Council of Basel is moving toward deposing Eugenius. Naples succession is already contested. The \"urgent matters\" are desperate pleas for help.\n11-25\nReform Stalled. The exile disrupted everything. Camera reform is suspended indefinitely. Parentucelli survives but has made no progress. The Council grows bolder. The Pope is isolated in Florence with few allies. Juan's petitions (Inquisition, Military Orders charter) remain untouched.\n26-40\nHolding Pattern. The Pope survived the exile and maintains his position in Florence, but the Camera reform is frozen. Parentucelli has preserved what exists but cannot advance. The Council and Pope are locked in stalemate. News of Juan's Constantinople success has helped morale but changed nothing concrete.\n41-55\nModest Progress Despite Exile. Somehow, despite the chaos, Parentucelli has made limited progress on Camera reform. The Pope's position in Florence is stable. Juan's Constantinople achievements have strengthened Eugenius's hand in the Greek negotiations. Outstanding petitions may be ready for consideration.\n56-70\nResilient Reformers. The exile forced reform to go underground, but Parentucelli used the disruption to purge the worst elements. The Pope's position is stronger than expected. The Greek delegation favors Eugenius over Basel. Juan's Eastern successes are being used as propaganda. Progress on multiple fronts.\n71-85\nTurning Point. The exile, counterintuitively, broke the power of the corrupt Roman interests. Camera reform has advanced significantly in Florence. The Council of Basel is overreaching and losing support. The Greeks clearly prefer dealing with Eugenius. Juan's return comes at a pivotal moment.\n86-95\nUnexpected Strength. Eugenius has used the exile productively. Camera reform is further along than anyone expected. Parentucelli has become indispensable. The Council's aggression is backfiring. Multiple European powers are reconsidering their neutrality. Juan's petitions have been approved and await only his signature.\n96-100\nTransformation. The crisis became an opportunity. The Pope, freed from Roman corruption and Colonna interference, has rebuilt his administration from Florence. Camera reform is nearly complete. The Greek delegation has all but committed to an Italian reunion council. Juan's arrival with news of the Ottoman truce and Constantinople's stabilization could tip the balance decisively against Basel.\n\n\nRoll d100."

The question is whether he left any forces behind or if the entire expedition went to Constantinople.\n\nFrom Chapter 2.17:\n- 591 knights fit for duty\n- 10 ships operational\n- They were heading to Constantinople\n\nIt seems like Juan took his entire force to Constantinople. The question is whether the Castilian alliance and the threat of Juan's return would have deterred the Colonna revolt, or whether history proceeded as normal.\n\nThis is a great point by the player - we should determine whether the Colonna revolt happened in our timeline. The factors:\n\nFavoring the revolt NOT happening:\n- Juan's alliance with Eugenius was public and powerful\n- The Castilians had demonstrated military capability\n- The Camera reform was beginning, which might have neutralized some enemies through the amnesty approach\n\n\n- The threat of Juan's return might deter action\n\nPotential scenarios emerge. The Colonna might hesitate, knowing Juan's swift military response could be imminent. His demonstrated commitment to the Pope and the Camera reform created a complex political landscape that could discourage immediate rebellion. However, the Colonna's deep-seated grievances and the potential power vacuum suggested the revolt remained a distinct possibility.\n\nA strategic chaos roll would illuminate the nuanced outcomes of this volatile political moment, revealing the unpredictable dynamics between papal authority and noble resistance.\n\n\nYou raise an excellent point. Let me reconsider.\n\n\nWhat We Know from Our Timeline:\n\n\nMarch 1434: Juan arrived in Rome with ~600 knights\n\nMarch 22, 1434: Juan met with Eugenius, initiated Camera reform with Parentucelli\n\nMarch 1434: Juan discussed securing the Camera building with 50-100 men who would swear allegiance to Eugenius personally\n\nJuan then departed for Constantinople with his fleet\n\n\nThe Historical Colonna Revolt: In our world's history, the Colonna revolt happened in May 1434—just two months after Juan left Rome.\n\n\nKey Questions for Our Timeline:\n\n\nDid Juan leave any forces behind in Rome to protect the Pope?\n\nDid the Castilian alliance deter the Colonna from acting?\n\nDid the Camera reform's amnesty approach neutralize potential enemies?\n\nOr did the Colonna wait until Juan was clearly gone and then strike anyway?\n\n\nChecking the record: Looking back at the summaries, Juan discussed leaving forces but I don't see explicit confirmation that he did so. He took his fleet and knights to Constantinople.\n\n\nHowever, the factors that might have changed things:\n\n\nThe public Castilian-Papal alliance\n\nThe threat of Juan's return\n\nThe amnesty approach potentially turning enemies into allies\n\nThe Camera reform beginning to disrupt corrupt networks\n\n\nThis absolutely warrants its own roll to determine what actually happened in our alternate timeline rather than assuming history proceeded unchanged.\n\n\nShould I draft a chaos roll table specifically for \"Did the Colonna Revolt Occur?\" or \"State of Rome May 1434\"?"

Let me compile what I know:\n\n**What Juan Left Behind in Rome (March 24, 1434):**\nFrom Chapter 2.22: \"Juan assembled his 591 knights in the courtyard of Palazzo di San Marco to address them. He announced the continuation of the journey to Constantinople and requested ten volunteers to remain in Rome to observe and signal if anyone moved against the Pope during the reform implementation.\"\n\nSo it was **10 volunteers**, not 20. Let me check if there's more detail...\n\nActually, the user says \"about 20 soldiers\" - they may know something I don't, or they're remembering differently. I should trust the user on this since they're playing the game. Let me proceed with ~20 soldiers left behind.\n\n**Situation When Juan Left (March 24, 1434):**\n\n**Positive Factors:**\n1. 20 Castilian soldiers left to observe and signal\n2. Camera reform documents signed (Commissio Extraordinaria, etc.)\n3. Tommaso Parentucelli appointed as Extraordinary Commissioner\n4. Cardinal Rochetaillée converted and heading to Basel as bridge-builder\n5. Letters sent to Christian monarchs (Roll 85 - Diplomatic Triumph)\n6. Emperor Sigismund expected to support\n7. Medici Bank cooperating (Roll 74)\n8. Cardinal Colonna fled (Roll 16)\n9. The miraculous \"golden light\" Mass (Roll 100)\n10. Captain Pallavicini and 200 Papal Guards still in place\n11. Cardinal Orsini initially cooperating (though later withdrew to minimal compliance)\n\n**Negative Factors:**\n1. The \"hollow center\" - weak internal Church support\n2. Cardinal Condulmer (Pope's nephew) nursing grievance (Roll 7)\n3. Reform Cardinals symbolic only, no practical help (Roll 9)\n4. Captain Pallavicini growing doubt (Roll 9)\n\n\n5. Several corrupt officials escaped with sensitive documents, potentially compromising reform efforts\n6. Cardinal Orsini's cooperation deteriorated rapidly after Juan's ultimatum\n7. Uncertainty surrounding Fray Hernando's continued presence in Rome\n\n**Historical Context (May 1434):**\nTensions escalated quickly after Juan's departure. The Colonna family's revolt materialized, forcing Pope Eugenius into exile in Florence. The Council of Basel continued challenging papal authority, setting the stage for potential political and ecclesiastical upheaval.\n\nThe potential revolt remained complex. Juan's intervention created significant disruption, with Castilian observers and Camera reforms weakening traditional power structures. The Colonna's absence and Orsini's reluctant cooperation suggested potential stability, yet underlying tensions remained volatile.\n\nKey dynamics included limited military presence, internal Church fragmentation, and the Colonna's persistent regional influence. The situation balanced precariously between potential conflict and uneasy peace, with multiple factions watching each other's movements carefully.\n\nI'll develop a nuanced probability table to map potential scenarios during this extended period of uncertainty.\n\n\nI found it! From Chapter 2.22:\n\n\"Juan assembled his 591 knights in the courtyard of Palazzo di San Marco to address them. He announced the continuation of the journey to Constantinople and requested ten volunteers to remain in Rome to observe and signal if anyone moved against the Pope during the reform implementation.\"\n\nSo it was 10 volunteers left behind as observers/tripwire, not 20. Let me now compile the full picture.\n\n\n\nSITUATION WHEN JUAN DEPARTED ROME (March 24, 1434)\n\n\nAssets Left Behind:\n\n\n10 Castilian knight volunteers as observers\n\nTommaso Parentucelli as Extraordinary Commissioner\n\nCamera reform documents signed and announced\n\nCaptain Pallavicini and ~200 Papal Guards\n\nCardinal Rochetaillée heading to Basel as bridge-builder\n\n\nPositive Factors:\n\n\nLetters to monarchs produced diplomatic triumph (Roll 85)\n\nMedici Bank cooperating (Roll 74)\n\nCardinal Colonna already fled Rome (Roll 16)\n\nThe miraculous \"golden light\" Mass (Roll 100) created public momentum\n\nEmperor Sigismund expected to support\n\nRochetaillée genuinely converted (Roll 99)\n\n\nNegative Factors - \"The Hollow Center\":\n\n\nCardinal Condulmer (Pope's nephew) nursing bitter grievance (Roll 7)\n\nReform Cardinals: symbolic only, no practical help (Roll 9)\n\nCaptain Pallavicini: growing doubt (Roll 9)\n\n3-4 corrupt officials fled with documents (Roll 10)\n\nCardinal Orsini: withdrew to minimal compliance (Roll 5)\n\nFray Hernando's decision unclear\n\n\nHistorical Reality (What Happened in Our World):\n\n\nIn June 1434, the pope had to flee a revolt in Rome and began a ten-year exile in Florence.\n\nDisguised in the garb of a Benedictine monk, and carried part of the way on the shoulders of a sailor, he reached a boat on the Tiber, but was recognized and pelted with a shower of stones.\n\nThe Colonna family led this revolt\n\nThe next year, June 9, 1435, the council forbade the payment of annates and steadily refused any form of compensation to meet necessary papal expenses.\n\n\n\nCHAOS ROLL: ROME SINCE MARCH 1434\n\n\nTime Elapsed: 13 months (March 1434 to April 1435)\n\n\nCore Question: Did Juan's intervention—the Camera reform, the 10 observers, the international diplomatic pressure, the Colonna's pre-emptive flight—change the course of events?

The Colonna revolt happened anyway—delayed but not prevented. Pope Eugenius fled Rome in chaos (summer 1434). The 10 Castilian observers were killed or scattered. Parentucelli's reform collapsed. The Pope is in Florence, isolated, the Camera unreformed, and Basel is moving toward deposing him. Worse than history because the failed reform attempt created additional enemies.\n6-15\nHistory Repeats. Despite Juan's efforts, the fundamental dynamics reasserted themselves. A revolt (Colonna-backed or otherwise) forced Eugenius from Rome in late 1434. The Pope escaped to Florence. Camera reform is suspended indefinitely. Parentucelli survives but has no power. The 10 Castilians sent warning but couldn't prevent anything. The Council of Basel grows bolder. Juan's \"urgent summons\" is a plea for help from exile.\n16-30\nModified Crisis. The Colonna revolt was prevented or significantly weakened, but other pressures forced Eugenius from Rome anyway—perhaps Milanese pressure, internal Church politics, or simple unsustainability of the \"hollow center.\" The Pope is in Florence, but the Camera reform partially survived. Parentucelli maintained some progress. The situation is bad but not as catastrophic as it might have been.\n31-45\nHolding Pattern. Against expectations, Eugenius remained in Rome—but just barely. The Camera reform stalled after initial progress. Parentucelli faces constant obstruction. The 10 Castilians are still there, providing some security. The Pope is embattled but not exiled. Basel's aggression (annates abolition) threatens to tip the balance. Juan's arrival is desperately needed but the situation is salvageable.\n46-60\nStrained Stability. The Camera reform survived Juan's departure and continued making modest progress. Eugenius remained in Rome. The international pressure from Juan's letters helped. Parentucelli has made real headway despite passive resistance. Basel is aggressive but hasn't broken the Pope. The \"urgent matters\" are serious but not desperate—perhaps the Greek negotiations, or Naples succession, or Basel's latest provocations.\n61-75\nReform Endures. The Camera reform took root despite the hollow center. Parentucelli proved more capable than expected. The 10 Castilian observers became a nucleus of genuine papal security. Cardinal Rochetaillée's mission to Basel produced some reconciliation. Eugenius is stronger than when Juan left. The \"urgent matters\" may actually be opportunities—Greek reunion negotiations favor the Pope, perhaps Naples succession needs attention.\n76-85\nUnexpected Strength. The exile that happened historically was prevented. Juan's intervention—the reform, the international pressure, the Colonna's early flight—broke the pattern. Eugenius remained in Rome and consolidated power. The Camera reform advanced significantly. Parentucelli has become the Pope's right hand. Basel is overreaching and losing support. Juan returns to find an ally stronger than he left.\n86-95\nTransformation. The crisis became opportunity. The Camera reform, freed from Roman corruption networks, succeeded beyond expectations. Parentucelli is now a bishop or cardinal. The Greek delegation has effectively chosen to negotiate with Eugenius over Basel. International support is strong. The \"urgent matters\" may be good news—perhaps opportunities Juan couldn't have anticipated.\n96-100\nProvidence. Everything aligned. The hollow center filled with genuine reformers drawn by Rochetaillée's mission. Basel's overreach backfired spectacularly. The Greek Church is on the verge of reunion with Rome. The Camera is clean and functional. Eugenius is the strongest Pope in decades. Juan's Constantinople achievements and the Ottoman truce have electrified Christendom. The Pope summons Juan not for help but for celebration and planning the next phase.\n\n\nRoll d100."

      "say": "Thought process: Reconciled historical outcome with narrative intervention attempt.\n\nThe player rolled a 6, which falls in the 6-15 range: \"History Repeats.\"\n\nThis is a significant and sobering result. Despite Juan's efforts - the Camera reform, the 10 observers, the international diplomatic pressure, the Colonna's pre-emptive flight - the fundamental dynamics reasserted themselves. The Pope was forced to flee Rome, likely in the summer or fall of 1434, and is now in exile in Florence.\n\nThis is historically accurate to what actually happened - Pope Eugenius IV was indeed forced to flee Rome in June 1434 and spent about 10 years in exile in Florence. The roll of 6 suggests that while Juan's intervention may have delayed or slightly modified events, it couldn't overcome the structural weaknesses identified as \"the hollow center.\"\n\nLet me now narrate what happened and set up the scene for Juan's arrival at Ostia to find... not Rome waiting, but news that he must travel to Florence instead.\n\n\nThe die satisfies history's hunger.\n\n\n\nWHAT HAPPENED IN ROME\n\n\nJune 1434 — The Revolt\n\n\nThree months after Juan sailed east, it happened anyway.\n\n\nNot the Colonna directly—Prospero was still in the Campagna, sending his measured letters of \"concern.\" But the hollow center that Cardinal Rochetaillée had warned about finally collapsed. Captain Pallavicini's growing doubts became open hesitation. The Papal Guard, sensing their commander's uncertainty, performed their duties with less and less conviction. Cardinal Condulmer's grievance became a gathering point for whispered complaints. The reform cardinals who had knelt in the golden light proved, as Fray Hernando predicted, to be men swept up in the moment rather than men whose hearts had changed.\n\n\nThe ten Castilian observers sent urgent messages—but to Constantinople, weeks away by sea. By the time their warnings could possibly have reached Juan, it was already over.\n\n\nThe immediate trigger was prosaic: a dispute over grain prices in Trastevere that escalated into riots. The Colonna retainers who had never truly left the city emerged from their quarters. The Papal Guard... hesitated. Pallavicini gave no clear orders. By the time anyone understood what was happening, armed men controlled the bridges.\n\n\nPope Eugenius IV fled Rome on June 4, 1434, disguised in the rough habit of a Benedictine monk. He was recognized on the Tiber and pelted with stones, escaping only by lying flat in a boat while a sailor shielded him. He reached Ostia, then a galley to Livorno, then Florence.\n\n\nThe ten Castilian knights fought their way to the docks and escaped on a Venetian merchant vessel. Three were wounded. None were killed—but none could prevent what happened.\n\n\n\nThe Aftermath\n\n\nTommaso Parentucelli accompanied the Pope to Florence. The Camera reform documents traveled with them—parchment promises now governing nothing. In Rome, the old networks quietly reconstituted themselves. Officials who had fled returned. Ledgers that had been surrendered were reclaimed. The clean slate was erased.\n\n\nIn Florence, Eugenius established a court in exile. The Medici, ever pragmatic, provided hospitality and loans. Parentucelli continued his work in diminished form—cataloguing what had been lost, preserving what records survived, planning for a return that seemed increasingly distant.\n\n\nThe Council of Basel, emboldened, passed increasingly aggressive measures. On January 22, 1435, they decreed against clerical concubinage and regulated excommunication. On June 9, 1435—just weeks ago—they abolished annates entirely, cutting off a major source of papal revenue and offering no compensation for necessary expenses.\n\n\nCardinal Rochetaillée's mission to Basel produced... words. Expressions of hope. Promises to consider. The constitutional question—whether councils command popes or popes command councils—remained unresolved. The French faction, despite Rochetaillée's personal conversion, continued to press for conciliar supremacy.\n\n\nThe Greek envoys, negotiating simultaneously with Pope and Council about where to hold a reunion assembly, found themselves courted by both parties. They expressed preference for an Italian city—which suited Eugenius—but Basel insisted on Basel itself, or Avignon, or Savoy. The negotiations dragged on.\n\n\n\nApril 1435 — The Summons\n\n\nWhen Juan's fleet arrived at Ostia, the papal messenger waiting on the dock carried not a summons to Rome but directions to Florence.\n\n\nThe \"urgent matters\" are exactly what Juan might fear:\n\n\nThe Pope is in exile, his reform in ruins\n\nThe Council of Basel grows more aggressive by the month\n\nThe Camera remains unreformed, now operating without even the pretense of papal oversight\n\nQueen Giovanna II of Naples is dying—succession crisis imminent\n\nThe Greek negotiations hang in the balance\n\nAnd Eugenius, having heard fragmentary reports of Juan's achievements in Constantinople and the Ottoman truce, sees in his Castilian ally perhaps the only force capable of reversing his fortunes\n\n\n\nThe harbor at Ostia is quiet. The great warehouses that once processed the wealth of an empire now stand half-empty. A single papal messenger in worn livery waits on the dock, his horse looking as tired as he does.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, kneeling. \"His Holiness Pope Eugenius sends greeting from Florence. He begs—\" the man catches himself, \"—he requests your presence at the earliest moment. There are matters of some urgency he wishes to discuss.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, clearly uncomfortable delivering the next part.\n\n\n\"His Holiness is no longer in Rome, Your Majesty. He has been... residing in Florence since last summer. The situation is... complex.\"\n\n\nThe man's eyes carry the exhaustion of someone who has explained this too many times."

More importantly - Juan would have heard about a June 1434 exile long before April 1435. He was in Constantinople, yes, but news travels. Merchants, diplomats, the Hospitaller network at Rhodes - someone would have told him. Having him learn about it only now, after 10+ months, is unrealistic and unfair.\n\n3. The solution the user proposes is elegant: if the roll result is that the exile happens, it should happen RECENTLY - close enough to Juan's arrival that he couldn't have known. This means the exile would have happened in late March or early April 1435, not June 1434.\n\n4. Yes, this is a huge setback. The user acknowledges that. But that's what a roll of 6 means - bad things happen. The key is to make it fair and logical within the timeline.\n\nLet me revise:\n\n**Revised Timeline:**\n- March 1434: Juan leaves Rome with 10 observers\n- March 1434 - March 1435: Things are strained but holding (the \"hollow center\" is barely functioning, but it's functioning)\n- Early April 1435: Something triggers a crisis - perhaps related to Basel's June 9, 1435 annates abolition being debated/imminent, or some other trigger\n- The revolt/crisis happens in late March or very early April 1435\n- Juan arrives at Ostia in late April 1435 to find the Pope has JUST fled, perhaps days or a couple weeks ago\n\nThis makes the timing much tighter and more dramatically appropriate. Juan arrives to find a fresh crisis, not an old one he should have known about.\n\nAlso, I should NOT include Basel developments in this - that's a separate roll. The roll was for Rome specifically.\n\nLet me rewrite this properly.\n\n\nYou're absolutely right on both counts. Let me fix this.\n\n\nCorrections:\n\n\nScope: This roll covers Rome only. Basel, the Greek negotiations, and other external developments need separate rolls.\n\nTimeline: If Juan had been in exile since June 1434, he would have heard about it months ago through any number of channels—Hospitallers at Rhodes, Venetian merchants, diplomatic correspondence. The news would have reached Constantinople by autumn at the latest.\n\n\nThe fix: The crisis happened recently—within the last few weeks. The \"hollow center\" held together for nearly a year through inertia, Parentucelli's determination, and fear of Juan's return. But it finally collapsed in March/April 1435, just before or as Juan was sailing west.\n\n\nThis means:\n\n\nJuan genuinely couldn't have known\n\nThe wound is fresh, not festered\n\nThere may still be things to salvage\n\nThe situation is in flux, not settled\n\n\n\nShall I rewrite the narrative with the corrected timeline? The core outcome remains the same (Roll 6 = history repeats, Pope forced from Rome), but the timing shifts so that:\n\n\nThe crisis occurred in late March / early April 1435\n\nEugenius fled Rome perhaps 2-3 weeks before Juan's arrival\n\nThe situation is chaotic and still developing\n\nJuan arrives into an active crisis, not ancient history"

Juan arrives into an active crisis.\n\n\n\nWHAT HAPPENED IN ROME\n\n\nMarch 1434 — April 1435: The Long Vigil\n\n\nFor thirteen months, the hollow center held.\n\n\nNot because it filled—it never did. The reform cardinals who had knelt in the golden light attended ceremonies and made appropriate statements, but when Parentucelli needed access to records or pressure on reluctant officials, they were unavailable. Cardinal Condulmer nursed his grievance in private, a wound that never healed. Cardinal Orsini performed minimal compliance, nothing more. Captain Pallavicini's doubts grew slowly, like rust.\n\n\nBut the hollow center held anyway, through sheer inertia and fear. Fear of Juan's return. Fear of the international pressure his letters had generated. Fear of being seen as the one who broke faith with the Pope while a thousand Castilian knights fought for Constantinople.\n\n\nParentucelli worked like a man possessed. He catalogued the Camera's debts, restructured its operations within the limits of his authority, and built relationships with the honest officials who remained. Progress was agonizingly slow—every request met with delays, every document \"misfiled,\" every reform requiring twice the effort it should have. But progress happened.\n\n\nThe ten Castilian knights became a quiet fixture in Vatican life. Not enough to stop anything, but enough to observe. Enough to send reports. Enough to remind everyone that Castile was watching.\n\n\nCardinal Colonna remained in the Campagna, sending his measured letters. Waiting.\n\n\n\nLate March 1435 — The Breaking Point\n\n\nWhat finally broke the stalemate was not conspiracy but exhaustion.\n\n\nCaptain Pallavicini fell ill in early March—a fever that left him bedridden for two weeks. His lieutenant, a man named Corsini, lacked both his authority and his caution. Small things began to slip. Guard rotations grew irregular. Discipline frayed.\n\n\nCardinal Condulmer, nursing thirteen months of grievance, finally found his moment. He did not organize a revolt—that would have been too bold for a man whose wound was abandonment, not ambition. But he stopped discouraging others. He let it be known, quietly, that the Pope's nephew considered himself wronged. That the reform had been imposed by a foreign king. That Rome had been humiliated.\n\n\nThe Colonna retainers who had never truly left the city began to emerge from their quarters. Not armed—not yet. Just... present. Visible. A reminder that the old powers had not disappeared.\n\n\nOn March 28th, a grain dispute in Trastevere escalated into riots. Corsini, uncertain of his authority, waited for orders that Pallavicini was too ill to give. By the time the Papal Guard mobilized, Colonna men had secured two bridges.\n\n\nThe next six days were chaos. Not a coordinated coup—something messier, more organic. The hollow center finally collapsed under its own weight. Officials who had been passively obstructing reform now openly defied it. Guards who had performed adequately but without energy simply... stopped performing. Cardinal Condulmer emerged from his chambers to receive visitors who spoke of \"restoration\" and \"stability.\"\n\n\n\nApril 3, 1435 — The Flight\n\n\nPope Eugenius IV fled Rome before dawn on April 3rd, three weeks before Juan's fleet arrived at Ostia.\n\n\nThe flight was ugly. Disguised in the rough habit of a Benedictine monk, Eugenius was recognized on the Tiber and pelted with stones. He escaped only by lying flat in a small boat while a loyal servant shielded him with a wooden board. He reached Ostia by midday, took a galley to Livorno, and arrived in Florence on April 8th.\n\n\nTommaso Parentucelli accompanied him, carrying what documents he could save. Thirteen months of painstaking work—not destroyed, but suspended. Frozen. The Camera reform existed on parchment, witnessed and sealed, but governed nothing.\n\n\nThe ten Castilian knights fought their way to the docks on the night of April 2nd, warned by servants loyal to Parentucelli. Two were wounded in the escape. They sailed on a Venetian merchant vessel, reaching Ostia on April 5th—two days after the Pope's flight. They have been waiting there since, unsure whether to sail for Florence, for Constantinople, or simply to wait.\n\n\n\nApril 1435 — The Current Situation\n\n\nRome is not under Colonna control—nothing so organized. Cardinal Colonna himself has not returned from the Campagna. What exists is a vacuum. The Camera officials who fled in March 1434 have returned. The old networks are reconstituting themselves. Cardinal Condulmer has not claimed any authority, but he receives visitors and speaks of \"healing\" and \"reconciliation.\"\n\n\nThe Pope has been in Florence for barely two weeks. The Medici, ever pragmatic, have provided hospitality. Eugenius is safe but shaken—a man who watched his reform crumble and his city reject him.

The wound is fresh.\n\n\n\nLate April 1435 — Ostia\n\n\nThe harbor at Ostia is tense. Merchants whisper about what happened in Rome. Ships from the papal fleet—those whose captains remained loyal—are anchored offshore, uncertain of their status. A small camp of refugees from the Vatican household has formed near the docks.\n\n\nThe papal messenger who meets Juan's fleet is not a tired man in worn livery—he is one of the ten Castilian knights, a man named Diego de Salazar, his arm still bandaged from the escape three weeks ago.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He kneels, and there is something like relief breaking through the exhaustion in his face. \"Thank God. Thank God you've come.\"\n\n\nHe rises, struggling to find the words.\n\n\n\"Rome has fallen, Your Majesty. Not to the Turks—to itself. The Pope fled three weeks ago. He's in Florence. Parentucelli is with him. We—\" he gestures to the camp, where Juan can now see other familiar faces, other white tabards stained with travel, \"—we got out. Barely.\"\n\n\nHe swallows hard.\n\n\n\"It happened so fast. One week everything was holding together, the next... I don't know how to explain it. It just broke. Like a rope that frays and frays and then suddenly snaps.\"\n\n\nHis voice drops.\n\n\n\"What are your orders, Your Majesty?\""

He wants to know who is on his side and what resources are available.\n\nLet me think about who would be present:\n1. The surviving Castilian knights who escaped Rome (8 of the 10, since 2 were wounded but survived)\n2. Diego de Salazar (the one who just reported)\n3. Juan's fleet commanders from the Constantinople expedition\n4. Fray Hernando de Talavera (his confessor) - wait, did Fray Hernando stay in Rome or go with Juan? Let me check... In Chapter 2.21, Juan asked if Fray Hernando would consider staying in Rome for a year. Hernando asked for a night to pray on it. I need to check if there was a resolution to this...\n\nLooking at Chapter 2.22, it mentions \"Farewell to Pope Eugenius IV\" but doesn't specifically mention Fray Hernando's decision. The chapter summaries don't make it clear.\n\nActually, looking back at the campaign context - Fray Hernando has been Juan's confessor throughout the Constantinople journey. So he likely went WITH Juan to Constantinople, not stayed in Rome.\n\nLet me think about who would be at this war council:\n\nFROM JUAN'S FLEET (just arrived from Constantinople):\n- Juan II himself\n- Fray Hernando de Talavera (confessor)\n- Fleet commanders/captains\n- Queen Lucia and the ladies (though not at a war council)\n- Sotomayor? No, he stayed in Constantinople\n- Key knights from the expedition\n\nFROM THE ROME ESCAPEES:\n- Diego de Salazar (wounded, reported)\n- Other surviving Castilian knights (7-8 others)\n- Possibly some Vatican household refugees\n\nNOT PRESENT BUT RELEVANT:\n- Pope Eugenius IV (in Florence)\n- Tommaso Parentucelli (in Florence with the Pope)\n- The Portuguese ladies (Dona Maria stayed in Corfu with Dona Inês)\n\n\nI'll swiftly organize a strategic meeting at the Ostia docks, gathering key personnel to assess our current situation.

Afternoon light filters through gaps in the wooden walls.\n\n\nPRESENT:\n\n\nFrom Juan's Fleet:\n\n\nFray Hernando de Talavera — confessor, spiritual advisor\n\nCaptain Vargas — fleet commander, ten ships\n\nCommander Mendoza — senior military officer of the expedition (Calatrava)\n\nApproximately 400 knights fit for duty (remainder of Constantinople garrison left behind under Sotomayor, plus losses to illness and the Corfu situation)\n\n\nFrom the Rome Escape:\n\n\nDiego de Salazar — wounded, leader of the ten observers\n\nSix other Castilian knights — two still recovering from wounds sustained during the escape\n\nFather Giuliano — Vatican chaplain who fled with them, Italian, loyal to Eugenius\n\nThree papal scribes — minor officials who chose exile over collaboration\n\n\nNotably Absent:\n\n\nQueen Lucia and Princess Catalina (aboard ship, safe but not at war council)\n\nDona Maria and Dona Inês (still in Corfu)\n\n\n\nDiego de Salazar gives his report first, standing despite his bandaged arm:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, here is what we know. The Pope reached Florence on April 8th. Parentucelli is with him, along with perhaps twenty loyal household members. The Medici are providing hospitality—Cosimo himself has guaranteed the Pope's safety within Florence.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, organizing his thoughts.\n\n\n\"Rome is not occupied in any military sense. Cardinal Colonna has not returned from the Campagna. What exists is... chaos. A vacuum. The old Camera officials came back within days of the Pope's flight. Cardinal Condulmer is receiving visitors but has not claimed any formal authority. The Papal Guard—\" his voice tightens with anger, \"—did nothing. Pallavicini was ill, his lieutenant was useless, and when it mattered, they simply stood aside.\"\n\n\nFather Giuliano, a slight man with ink-stained fingers, adds quietly: \"The reform documents are safe, Your Majesty. Parentucelli took them. The Commissio Extraordinaria, the Bulla Reformationis, the signed Basel decrees—all traveled with us to Florence. The reform exists in law. It simply... governs nothing at present.\"\n\n\nCommander Mendoza, a weathered knight of Calatrava, speaks next: \"Your Majesty, we have four hundred knights fit for duty and ten ships. We could take Rome by force—the city has no organized defense. But holding it...\" He shakes his head. \"Four hundred men cannot hold Rome against determined opposition. And if we take it by sword, we make the Pope look like a foreign puppet.\"\n\n\nCaptain Vargas nods grimly. \"The fleet is sound. We can reach Florence by sea—Livorno, then overland—within four or five days. Or we can sail up the Tiber to Rome itself, though that announces our presence rather dramatically.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando has been silent, watching. Now he speaks:\n\n\n\"The question, Your Majesty, is not merely military. It is political. What does the Pope need? What does the Church need? A Spanish king conquering Rome to restore a Pope that Romans rejected—that is one story. A Pope returning in strength with allies who support reform—that is another story entirely.\"\n\n\nHe meets Juan's eyes.\n\n\n\"What story do we wish to tell?\"\n\n\nThe warehouse falls silent.

The 1434 Roman revolt wasn't a clean coup by one faction. It was more of a collapse. The question of who to blame is politically and morally complex:\n\n1. Cardinal Condulmer - the Pope's own nephew, who nursed grievance and enabled opposition through inaction/passive encouragement. But he didn't organize anything directly.\n\n2. The Colonna family - their retainers seized bridges, they've been opposing the Pope for years, Prospero Colonna fled earlier. But Prospero himself hasn't returned to Rome.\n\n3. Captain Pallavicini / Lieutenant Corsini - failed in their duty, but through illness and incompetence rather than treachery.\n\n4.

The Roman populace - the grain riots were the trigger.\n\nThis is a great moment for the NPCs to give different answers, reflecting the complexity of the situation. Diego might blame the Colonna.

Two hundred and fifteen men, armed and armored. The Caballeros del Defensor in their distinctive tabards at the front, support troops behind, the five fit survivors from the Rome escape serving as guides.\n\n\nThe royal banner stays furled for now—wrapped in canvas, carried by a trusted man near Juan.\n\n\nRodrigo de Mendoza gives the order. The column moves.\n\n\n\nThe Road to Rome\n\n\nFifteen miles. Four hours at a hard march, perhaps five with men in armor. The road from Ostia follows the Tiber, the same road Juan traveled in triumph nearly two years ago when he first arrived in Rome with eight hundred crusaders and sacred relics.\n\n\nThe countryside is quiet. Farmers watch the column pass from their fields. A merchant's cart pulls aside to let them through, the driver's eyes wide. No one challenges them. No one asks questions.\n\n\nWord will spread. But word travels at the speed of a man on horseback, and Juan's column is moving fast.\n\n\n\nLate Afternoon — Approaching Rome\n\n\nThe walls of Rome come into view as the sun begins its descent. The column has made good time—the men are tired but not exhausted, discipline holding firm.\n\n\nDiego de Salazar rides up beside Juan. \"The Porta Portuensis is ahead, Your Majesty. It opens onto Trastevere—the quarter that supported the Pope. From there, Ponte Sisto is perhaps half a mile. Ponte Sant'Angelo another half mile beyond that, across the river and north along the bank.\"\n\n\nHe points. \"There—outside the gate. The wine seller's stall. I see Isaac.\"\n\n\n\nAt the Gate\n\n\nIsaac is leaning against a barrel, looking for all the world like a tired merchant resting his feet. As Juan approaches, he straightens and walks to meet the column, falling into step beside the King's horse.\n\n\nHis voice is low and quick:\n\n\n\"The city is quiet. Too quiet. The gate is unmanned—no one is checking who comes and goes. I walked halfway to Ponte Sisto before turning back.\"\n\n\nHe glances up at Juan.\n\n\n\"The bridge is held. I counted thirty-two men. Colonna colors. They have a barricade across the near side—wine barrels and timber, waist-high. Crossbows visible, perhaps six or eight. The rest have clubs and swords. They're not soldiers, Your Majesty. They're retainers playing at being soldiers.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"They're bored. They've been sitting on that bridge for three weeks and nothing has happened. They are not expecting two hundred armed men to come marching out of Trastevere.\"\n\n\nRodrigo de Mendoza moves his horse closer, listening. His hand rests on his sword hilt.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty. Thirty men behind a makeshift barricade, against two hundred professionals. We'll go through them like a knife through cloth. But if they get a messenger away to Ponte Sant'Angelo before we take them...\"\n\n\nHe leaves the implication hanging.\n\n\n\"Do you want prisoners? Or do you want speed?\""

He's marching on Ponte Sisto with ~215 men against ~32 Colonna retainers behind a makeshift barricade.\n\nThis is a chaos roll situation. Let me think about the factors:\n\n**Factors favoring Juan:**\n- Overwhelming numerical superiority (215 vs 32)\n- Professional soldiers vs retainers \"playing at being soldiers\"\n- Element of surprise - they've been bored for three weeks\n- Juan himself marching with the armored men (inspiring)\n- Elite troops (Los Caballeros del Defensor) leading\n- Clear plan, good discipline\n- The retainers are not expecting this at all\n- Juan's banner unfurled - psychological impact of the King of Castile himself appearing\n\n**Factors that could go wrong:**\n- Crossbows could cause casualties before contact\n- Someone could escape to warn Ponte Sant'Angelo\n- The retainers could panic and fight desperately\n- Civilian interference/confusion\n- Something unexpected in the city\n\n**Factors that could go very well:**\n- Complete rout/surrender without fighting\n- Capturing key individuals\n- Psychological shock causing collapse at both bridges\n- Popular support in Trastevere (they supported the Pope)\n\nThis should be a heavily weighted roll in Juan's favor given the overwhelming advantages, but chaos rolls have wide variance.\n\nLet me construct a d100 table:\n\n1-5: Something goes badly wrong (unexpected reinforcements? Ambush? Key casualty?)\n6-15: Victory but costly or complicated\n16-35: Solid victory, some resistance, minor issues\n36-60: Clean victory, bridge secured, pursuit possible\n61-80: Excellent result - total collapse, prisoners, momentum\n81-95: Exceptional - both bridges fall in rapid succession\n96-100: Providence - something extraordinary happens\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The situation heavily favors Juan:\n- 7:1 numerical advantage\n\n\n- Professional military expertise creates a stark contrast with amateur defenders\n- Total element of surprise amplifies psychological pressure\n- Royal banner signals overwhelming authority and intimidation\n\nI'll refine the roll to capture nuanced potential outcomes. The core question isn't whether Juan succeeds, but how comprehensively and cleanly he achieves his objective. The roll needs to reflect potential complications, prisoner captures, and unexpected city dynamics.\n\nThe range reveals escalating scenarios from messy confrontations to potential bloodless capitulation, with each bracket representing increasingly favorable strategic resolution. Messengers escaping could trigger broader regional alerts, while total surrender suggests profound psychological impact of Juan's approach.\n\n\nThe banner unfurls. The white field with the arms of Castile catches the late afternoon light. Two hundred men in steel begin their march toward Ponte Sisto.\n\n\nJuan grips his poleaxe and takes his place among the armored vanguard.\n\n\n\nCHAOS ROLL: THE BATTLE FOR PONTE SISTO\n\n\nSituation:\n\n\n215 professional soldiers against 32 Colonna retainers\n\nComplete tactical surprise\n\nMakeshift barricade (wine barrels and timber)\n\n6-8 crossbows, rest armed with clubs and swords\n\nDefenders have been idle for three weeks\n\nThe King of Castile himself marches with the vanguard\n\n\nFactors Favoring Juan:\n\n\nOverwhelming numerical superiority (7:1)\n\nProfessional soldiers vs. retainers \"playing at soldiers\"\n\nTotal surprise—they're expecting nothing\n\nElite Caballeros del Defensor leading the assault\n\nPsychological impact of the royal banner\n\nPopular support in Trastevere (pro-papal quarter)\n\n\nWhat Could Go Wrong:\n\n\nCrossbow bolts before contact\n\nMessenger escapes to warn Ponte Sant'Angelo\n\nDesperate resistance causes unnecessary casualties\n\nUnexpected reinforcements or complications\n\nCivilian interference\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDisaster. Something unexpected—a hidden force, a terrible accident, a key casualty. Victory still likely but at serious cost or complication.\n6-15\nCostly Victory. The retainers fight harder than expected. Crossbow bolts find gaps in armor. The bridge is taken, but men are lost and messengers escape toward Sant'Angelo.\n16-30\nComplicated Victory. The bridge falls quickly, but someone slips away in the chaos. Ponte Sant'Angelo will know you're coming.\n31-50\nSolid Victory. Professional soldiers do professional work. The barricade is swept aside, most defenders captured or scattered into the city (not toward Sant'Angelo). Minor casualties at worst.\n51-70\nClean Victory. The retainers break at the sight of the advancing column. Bridge secured in minutes. No messengers escape. Juan's forces are ready to move immediately on Sant'Angelo.\n71-85\nRout. The Colonna men don't even try to fight. Some throw down their weapons, others flee into Trastevere where the locals—remembering who supported the Pope—are not kind to them. Prisoners taken. Intelligence gained.\n86-95\nCascade. Word of the Castilian column spreads through Rome faster than feet can run. By the time Isaac reaches Ponte Sant'Angelo, the defenders there are already arguing about whether to stand or flee.\n96-100\nBloodless. The banner appears. The armored column advances. And the Colonna retainers—thirty-two men who signed up for easy money guarding a bridge no one cared about—take one look at what's coming and simply leave. No fight. No casualties. Just abandoned barricades and the bridge standing open.\n\n\nRoll d100."

This is the bloodless victory - the best possible outcome.\n\nLet me write this out dramatically but realistically. The retainers see 215 professional soldiers with the King of Castile's banner and they just... leave. They're not soldiers, they're retainers who have been sitting on a bridge for three weeks. They're not going to die for this.\n\nThis is a \"Bloodless\" outcome. I should narrate:\n1. The approach\n2. The moment of realization for the defenders\n3. The abandonment\n4. The immediate aftermath\n5. Set up Isaac moving ahead to Sant'Angelo\n6. The momentum building\n\nThis is a huge win for Juan after the devastating roll of 6 for what happened in Rome. Fortune balances itself.\n\n\n\nTHE BATTLE FOR PONTE SISTO\n\n\nThere is no battle.\n\n\nThe column rounds the last corner into the small piazza before the bridge. The banner catches the slanting afternoon light—the castle and lion of Castile, unmistakable. Two hundred armored men march in formation behind it, steel gleaming, poleaxes and swords at the ready.\n\n\nAt the barricade, a man looks up from the dice game he's been playing with two companions. He squints. He stands. He says something to the others.\n\n\nFor a long moment, nothing happens.\n\n\nThen one of the Colonna retainers—a younger man, perhaps eighteen—simply sets down his crossbow, climbs over the back of the barricade, and walks away. Not running. Just... walking. Toward the side streets of Trastevere.\n\n\nAnother follows. Then three more.\n\n\nBy the time Juan's vanguard is fifty yards from the barricade, the defenders are climbing over each other to get away. Crossbows clatter to the cobblestones. Someone trips over a wine barrel and sprawls, scrambles up, keeps running. A few disappear into alleys. Others just stand against walls, hands raised, faces pale.\n\n\nThe column doesn't even break stride.\n\n\n\nThe Bridge\n\n\nRodrigo de Mendoza signals the light troops forward. They pour around the barricade, securing the far side of the bridge, but there's nothing to secure against. The Colonna men are simply gone—scattered into a city that, as Isaac noted, has been waiting to see what happens.\n\n\nJuan steps over an abandoned crossbow. The barricade is pathetic up close—wine barrels, a broken cart, some timber planks. Three weeks of \"occupation\" amounting to a few dozen bored men playing dice.\n\n\nDiego de Salazar appears at Juan's side, slightly out of breath. \"Your Majesty. No casualties. None. We have... I think eleven prisoners? Men who surrendered rather than run. The rest fled into the city.\"\n\n\nHe shakes his head in disbelief.\n\n\n\"They just left.\"\n\n\n\nTrastevere\n\n\nThe people of Trastevere are emerging from their homes. This is the quarter that cheered Juan's arrival two years ago. The quarter that threw flowers. The quarter that supported the Pope.\n\n\nAn old woman makes the sign of the cross as Juan passes. A baker stands in his doorway, flour-dusted, staring. A child points and asks his mother something in rapid Italian.\n\n\nThen someone shouts: \"Il Re Crociato!\"\n\n\nThe Crusader King.\n\n\nMore voices take up the cry. Not a roar—not yet—but something building. Recognition. Hope. Doors opening. People spilling into the streets behind the column, following at a distance.\n\n\n\nIsaac\n\n\nIsaac is already moving. He catches Juan's eye, nods once, and slips ahead through the growing crowd, making for Ponte Sant'Angelo.\n\n\nRodrigo de Mendoza forms up the column for the march north along the riverbank. Half a mile to the next bridge. Half a mile to the Vatican.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He permits himself a thin smile. \"Word travels fast. Faster than men can run. By the time we reach Sant'Angelo...\"\n\n\nHe doesn't finish the sentence. He doesn't need to.\n\n\nThe column moves."

The main column (~180-185 men) marches north along the Tiber toward Ponte Sant'Angelo\n3. Word is spreading through Rome - \"Il Re Crociato\" has returned\n4. Isaac is scouting ahead\n5. The situation at Sant'Angelo may have changed due to the \"cascade\" effect of the 100 roll\n\nGiven the roll of 100 on the first bridge, there should be a continuing momentum effect. The news is spreading faster than the column can march. The Colonna retainers at Sant'Angelo will have heard something - maybe panicked reports from fleeing men, maybe rumors from the crowd.\n\nBut I should still have Juan encounter the situation and make decisions. Let me describe the march and what they find at Sant'Angelo.\n\nShould I roll for Sant'Angelo? Given the 100 result, I think narrative momentum suggests the defenders there are already in disarray.

The rest, with me!\"\n\n\n\nTHE MARCH TO PONTE SANT'ANGELO\n\n\nHalf a Mile Along the Tiber\n\n\nTwenty soldiers peel off to hold Ponte Sisto—more than enough against nothing. The remaining column, nearly two hundred strong, moves north along the riverbank at a quick march.\n\n\nThe crowd follows. It's growing now—workers leaving their shops, women emerging from doorways, children darting between legs to get a better look. The cry of \"Il Re Crociato!\" spreads from voice to voice. Someone starts ringing a church bell. Then another.\n\n\nRome is waking up.\n\n\n\nThe Prisoners\n\n\nDiego de Salazar has the eleven captured Colonna retainers marched along with the column, hands bound. They're terrified—men who expected easy coin for sitting on a bridge, now prisoners of a foreign king whose reputation precedes him.\n\n\nOne of them, an older man with a weathered face, keeps glancing at Juan. Finally he calls out:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty! Your Majesty, please—we were only hired three weeks ago! We were told to watch the bridge, nothing more! No one said anything about—\"\n\n\nRodrigo silences him with a look.\n\n\nBut the information registers: hired three weeks ago. When the crisis began. Someone was paying for this.\n\n\n\nApproaching Ponte Sant'Angelo\n\n\nThe column rounds the bend and the bridge comes into view.\n\n\nPonte Sant'Angelo. The ancient bridge leading directly to Castel Sant'Angelo and the Vatican beyond. The key to papal Rome.\n\n\nIsaac is there, standing openly now—no need for subtlety. He's watching something on the bridge with an expression Juan has learned to read: amusement.\n\n\nAs Juan approaches, Isaac walks to meet him.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His voice carries a note of wonder. \"You should see this for yourself.\"\n\n\n\nPONTE SANT'ANGELO\n\n\nThought process: Envisioned chaotic enemy collapse following successful momentum.\n\nGiven the roll of 100, I should continue the momentum. The defenders here are likely in complete disarray. Let me describe a scene of chaos and collapse - not organized resistance, but men who have realized the game is up.\n\n\nThe barricade at Ponte Sant'Angelo is larger than the one at Ponte Sisto—proper timber, not wine barrels. It was built to hold.\n\n\nIt is not being held.\n\n\nForty or fifty Colonna retainers are milling about in complete chaos. Some are arguing. Some are already walking away. Two men are physically fighting each other—one trying to drag the other away from the barricade while shouting in rapid Italian. A crossbow lies in the middle of the bridge where someone dropped it.\n\n\nAs Juan's column comes into view, the arguments stop. Every face turns toward the approaching army.\n\n\nA man in better clothes than the others—some kind of captain or leader—takes one look at the banner, one look at the armored column, one look at the crowd of Romans following behind.\n\n\nHe throws his sword onto the cobblestones with a clatter.\n\n\n\"Basta,\" he says. Enough.\n\n\nHe walks toward Juan's column, hands raised.\n\n\n\"I am Enzo Colonna. A cousin.\" He says this with a grimace, as if the family connection is a burden. \"The men will not fight. There is no point. We were told to hold the bridge, not to die for it.\"\n\n\nHe stops a few yards from Juan, looking up at the King.\n\n\n\"What are your terms?\""

This is a moment of interrogation and potential humiliation for the Colonna man. Juan is making him explain himself publicly.\n\nThis is a key moment. Enzo Colonna is a minor member of the family, clearly not a leader but someone who was given a job. He's already surrendered. Now Juan is putting him on the spot in front of his men, the Castilian soldiers, and the growing crowd of Romans.\n\nHow would Enzo respond? He's been caught. He knows he's lost. He can either:\n1. Try to deflect blame upward (claim he was just following orders)\n2. Try to make excuses\n3. Be defiant (unlikely given he just surrendered)\n4. Be honest about the confusion\n\nGiven that he already threw down his sword and said \"Basta\" (enough), he seems like a man who's tired of this situation. He was hired three weeks ago to hold a bridge, probably didn't really understand or care about the politics, and now finds himself facing the King of Castile with two hundred soldiers.\n\nLet me write his response - probably a mix of deflection and honesty, because he genuinely might not have clear answers. The \"authority\" was probably murky - the Colonna family, but which Colonna? Cardinal Colonna is in the Campagna. This was a power grab by chaos, not organized conquest.\n\n\nEnzo Colonna's face flickers through several expressions—fear, calculation, resignation. The crowd of Romans behind Juan is growing. His own men are watching. There is no good answer, and he knows it.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I...\" He falters. Swallows. Tries again.\n\n\n\"Three weeks ago, there was chaos. Riots. The Pope fled. We were told—\" he stops himself, reconsiders his words. \"I was instructed to secure the bridge. To maintain order. To prevent... further unrest.\"\n\n\nSomeone in the crowd jeers. Enzo's jaw tightens.\n\n\n\"On whose authority?\" He repeats Juan's question back, almost to himself. \"I was told it came from the Cardinal. From Cardinal Colonna. But the Cardinal is in the Campagna. He has been in the Campagna for over a year. The orders came through...\"\n\n\nHe hesitates. This is the dangerous part.\n\n\n\"Through intermediaries. Men who claimed to speak for the family. For the stability of Rome.\"\n\n\nHe looks at Juan directly now, and there's something almost like relief in his eyes—the relief of a man who has been standing in an impossible position and finally sees a way out.\n\n\n\"I am a minor cousin, Your Majesty. I do not sit in councils. I do not make decisions. I was told to hold a bridge, and I was paid to hold a bridge. No one told me I would be facing—\" he gestures at the column, the banner, the growing crowd, \"—this.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"I do not know whose authority, Your Majesty. That is the truth. Rome has had no authority for three weeks. Only men with swords standing on bridges, waiting for someone to tell them what to do.\"\n\n\nThe church bells are still ringing across the city. More Romans are arriving every minute.\n\n\nEnzo Colonna stands in the afternoon light, a man who backed the wrong side of a chaos that had no sides, waiting to learn his fate."

This is a triumphant moment - both bridges secured without bloodshed, the crowd growing, the narrative of a \"plot against the Holy Pope\" spreading through Rome.\n\nThe Vatican itself should be interesting. Who is there? The chapter summaries mentioned:\n- Cardinal Condulmer (Pope's nephew) receiving visitors\n- The old Camera officials returned\n- The Papal Guard did nothing during the crisis\n- Captain Pallavicini was ill, his lieutenant Corsini was incompetent\n\nSo when Juan arrives at the Vatican, he should find... what? Probably not organized resistance. The guards there failed to protect the Pope - they're unlikely to fight Juan. Cardinal Condulmer is not a military man - he's a wounded nephew who created \"permission\" for the collapse through passive-aggressive grievance, not active conspiracy.\n\nThis should be another moment where Juan's arrival with armed men and legitimate authority simply... causes the vacuum to fill in his direction. The question is what he finds there and who he confronts.\n\nI should narrate the march to the Vatican and what Juan finds when he arrives.\n\n\nEnzo Colonna nods, something like gratitude flickering across his face.\n\n\n\"Thank you, Your Majesty. I will tell you everything I know.\"\n\n\nTwo soldiers take position on either side of him—not roughly, but clearly. He's a guest who cannot leave.\n\n\n\nTHE MARCH TO THE VATICAN\n\n\nAcross Ponte Sant'Angelo\n\n\nThe column crosses the ancient bridge, boots ringing on stone that has borne the weight of emperors and popes. Castel Sant'Angelo looms to the left—the great fortress where popes have fled in times of danger. Its gates are closed, but no one mans the walls.\n\n\nRodrigo de Mendoza eyes it professionally. \"Do we secure it, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\nThe fortress could hold a garrison. Could hide enemies. Could complicate things.\n\n\nBut the Vatican lies ahead. The heart of everything.\n\n\n\"Leave ten men to watch the gates,\" Juan orders. \"We move on.\"\n\n\n\nTHE VIA DELLA CONCILIAZIONE\n\n\nThe broad street leading to St. Peter's Square. Two years ago, Juan walked this road with eight hundred crusaders and sacred relics, crowds cheering, flowers falling from balconies.\n\n\nNow he walks it with two hundred soldiers and a growing mob of Romans, church bells ringing across the city, and the cry of \"Il Re Crociato!\" echoing off ancient walls.\n\n\nThe sun is setting. The dome of St. Peter's burns orange and gold.\n\n\n\nST. PETER'S SQUARE\n\n\nThought process: Assessed Vatican's defensive vulnerabilities and political landscape.\n\nWhat does Juan find at St. Peter's Square and the Vatican?\n\nBased on the chapter summaries:\n- The Papal Guard failed during the crisis. Captain Pallavicini was ill, his lieutenant Corsini was incompetent\n- Cardinal Condulmer has been receiving visitors, nursing his grievance\n- Old Camera officials returned\n- It's been three weeks since the Pope fled\n\nThe Vatican is probably not heavily defended. The Papal Guard might still be there, but they're the same men who stood aside when the Pope fled. They're not going to fight Juan.\n\nCardinal Condulmer is the key figure - the Pope's wounded nephew who created \"permission\" for the collapse. He's been receiving visitors, speaking of \"healing\" and \"reconciliation.\" He's not a military threat, but he's politically significant.\n\nLet me describe what Juan finds - probably a confused, demoralized Papal Guard and various officials who are uncertain what to do.\n\n\nThe great piazza opens before them. The obelisk at its center. The facade of the basilica. The papal palace beyond.\n\n\nAnd standing in uncertain formation before the steps of St. Peter's: the Papal Guard.\n\n\nPerhaps eighty men. They wear the papal colors but stand without conviction—some clutching weapons, others with arms at their sides. Their formation is ragged. No one seems to be giving orders.\n\n\nA man in officer's dress stands at their front. Not Pallavicini—this must be Corsini, the lieutenant who froze when it mattered.\n\n\nHe stares at the approaching column. At the banner. At the crowd of Romans flooding into the square behind Juan's soldiers. At the Colonna retainers who have been swept along, disarmed and confused.\n\n\nHis face is the face of a man who has been waiting three weeks for someone to tell him what to do, and has just realized that someone has finally arrived.\n\n\nHe does not draw his sword.\n\n\nHe does not give orders.\n\n\nHe simply stands there, mouth slightly open, as the King of Castile approaches with an army at his back.\n\n\n\nIsaac appears at Juan's elbow, having worked his way through the crowd.\n\n\n\"The palace,\" he says quietly. \"Cardinal Condulmer is inside. He has been receiving visitors all day—cardinals, officials, merchants. They are very interested in what is happening outside.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"What are your orders, Your Majesty?\""

So Diego and 6 others.\n\nJuan is ordering them to take 30 soldiers and secure the Camera again - the same building they helped secure during the original reform.\n\nThen he's addressing Corsini, the lieutenant of the Papal Guard who froze during the crisis, ordering him to assemble the Vatican guard.\n\nLet me play out these reactions realistically.\n\n\nDiego de Salazar's face transforms. For three weeks he has carried the weight of failure—of watching everything they built collapse, of fleeing in the night, of waiting helplessly at Ostia. Now he has a purpose again.\n\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty!\"\n\n\nHe turns to his fellow survivors—the five fit men who escaped Rome with him—and to the soldiers Juan indicates. \"You heard the King!

He will secure it again.\n\n\n\nCORSINI\n\n\nThe lieutenant of the Papal Guard flinches when Juan addresses him directly. He's a man of middling years, soft around the middle, with the look of someone who obtained his position through connections rather than merit.\n\n\n\"I—yes, Your Majesty. At once, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nHe turns and shouts orders, his voice cracking slightly. Runners are dispatched into the palace, into the barracks, into the basilica itself.\n\n\nThe eighty guards already assembled shift nervously. Some look relieved. Others look terrified. A few—the older ones, the ones who remember Juan's first arrival—stand a little straighter.\n\n\n\nTen Minutes Later\n\n\nThe Vatican Guard assembles in St. Peter's Square. Not the crisp formation of a professional force—more a ragged gathering of men in mismatched states of readiness. Some clearly roused from sleep or drink. Others still buckling on equipment.\n\n\nCorsini approaches Juan, sweating despite the cool evening air.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty. This is... this is everyone. One hundred and sixty-three men present.\" He swallows. \"Captain Pallavicini is—he is still recovering from his illness. He is in his quarters. Should I...?\"\n\n\nHe trails off, uncertain whether Juan wants the captain brought out or left alone.\n\n\nBehind Corsini, the guards wait in anxious silence. The Romans crowd the edges of the square, watching. The church bells have finally stopped ringing, but the silence that replaces them feels charged, expectant.\n\n\nThe windows of the papal palace glow with candlelight. Somewhere inside, Cardinal Condulmer and whoever else remains are watching, waiting to see what happens next."

This is a powerful moment - he's about to remind these men of their duty and likely use their own oath to rally them back to loyalty to the Pope.\n\nLet me think about what the oath of the Vatican Guard (or Papal Guard) would be in the 15th century. The Swiss Guard wasn't established until 1506 by Pope Julius II, so these would be Italian guards, likely a mix of Roman nobility's men and hired soldiers.\n\nTheir oath would likely include:\n- Loyalty to the Pope\n- Defense of the Holy See\n- Protection of the papal person\n- Obedience to papal commands\n\nCorsini is being put on the spot here. He's a man who failed in his duty - the Pope fled on his watch. Now he's being asked to recite the very oath he broke through inaction.\n\nThis is a dramatic moment. Let me play Corsini as nervous, stammering, but ultimately reciting the oath - which will then give Juan the moral high ground to either shame or rally these men.\n\n\nThe guards shuffle into something approaching attention. Not sharp—not the crisp response of disciplined soldiers—but they try. One hundred and sixty-three men forming ragged lines in the fading light of St. Peter's Square.\n\n\nCorsini pales.

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed persuasion mechanics and gauged guard redemption likelihood.\n\nThis is a significant persuasion attempt. Juan is trying to rally the Vatican Guard - men who failed in their duty - to recommit to their oaths and go to Florence to serve the Pope.\n\nLet me consult the persuasion skill to build an appropriate d100 table.\n\nKey factors:\n\n**Success Factors (working in Juan's favor):**\n1. Juan has just taken Rome bloodlessly - he holds all the power here\n2. The guards know they failed - guilt is a powerful motivator\n3. Juan is offering them redemption, not punishment\n4. The oath they swore is sacred - these are Catholic men in a Catholic age\n5. Juan framed this as deception, not their fault - giving them an out\n6. The crowd of Romans is watching - public shame vs. public redemption\n7. Juan's reputation as \"Il Re Crociato\" - a man of genuine faith\n8. The guards have been leaderless and confused - they WANT direction\n9. Juan is visibly angry but also merciful - a powerful combination\n10. Going to Florence is a concrete action they can take to redeem themselves\n\n**Failure Factors (working against Juan):**\n1. These men already broke their oath once - their character is suspect\n2. Some may have been complicit, not just passive\n3. Fear of what awaits them in Florence - will the Pope punish them?\n4. Corsini's leadership failure may have corrupted the culture\n5. Some may have families in Rome - leaving is not simple\n6. Three weeks of inaction has bred apathy\n7. They don't know Juan - he's a foreign king giving them orders\n\n**The Ask:**\nJuan is asking them to:\n- Acknowledge their failure\n- Recommit to their oaths\n- Travel to Florence\n- Present themselves to the Pope they failed\n\nThis is a significant ask but not an impossible one. Juan is offering redemption, not demanding it. He's framing their failure as deception rather than cowardice. He's appealing to their faith and honor.\n \nJuan's persuasion strategy demonstrates masterful psychological manipulation. He strategically balances righteous anger with compassionate redemption, creating a compelling narrative that appeals to the guards' honor and religious convictions. By publicly offering a path to restore their dignity, he transforms potential humiliation into an opportunity for personal and collective redemption.\n\nThe critical uncertainty lies in the guards' authentic response - whether they'll genuinely embrace this chance or merely comply superficially.\n\n\nThe words echo across St. Peter's Square. Juan's anger is real—not performed, not calculated. The kind of cold fury that comes from a man who worked for over a year to build something, only to see it crumble through the weakness of others.\n\n\nThe guards do not move. Do not speak. One hundred and sixty-three men stand frozen under the weight of accusation and the heavier weight of truth.\n\n\n\nPERSUASION: RALLY THE VATICAN GUARD\n\n\nThe Ask: Recommit to your oaths. Go to Florence. Serve the Pope you failed.\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nJuan holds absolute power here—he could punish them, but offers redemption instead\n\nSacred oath invoked—these are Catholic men who swore before God\n\nGuilt is overwhelming—they know they failed\n\nJuan frames it as deception, not cowardice—gives them honorable interpretation\n\nThe crowd of Romans watches—public shame vs. public redemption\n\n\"Il Re Crociato\" reputation—a man of genuine faith, not political calculation\n\nThree weeks leaderless—they desperately want direction\n\nConcrete path forward—go to Florence, serve the Pope, be redeemed\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nThey already broke their oath once—character is suspect\n\nSome may have been complicit, not merely passive\n\nFear of papal judgment—will Eugenius punish them?\n\nFamilies in Rome—leaving is complicated\n\nApathy bred by three weeks of inaction\n\n\nApproach Quality: Strong. Righteous anger followed by mercy. Sacred oath invoked. Honorable interpretation offered. Concrete action provided.\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nShame Hardens to Resentment. The accusation cuts too deep. Some men cannot bear to face their failure and turn it outward—muttering, resistance, perhaps even defiance. The guard fragments.\n11-25\nHollow Compliance. They hear the words but cannot feel them. Nods, murmurs of agreement, but no fire. Perhaps half will go to Florence. The rest will drift away.\n26-40\nGrudging Acceptance. The logic is sound, the path is clear, but hearts remain heavy. Most will go, but as men performing duty, not men reborn.\n41-55\nGenuine Response. Juan's words break through. Men kneel. Oaths are renewed. A solid majority commit to Florence with real conviction. Some still drift away—but the core holds.\n56-70\nConviction Rekindled. The shame becomes fuel. Men weep openly. Veterans step forward to lead. The guard reforms around renewed purpose. Nearly all commit.\n71-85\nTransformation. Juan's anger and mercy together forge something new. The failure becomes their crucible. They will go to Florence not as shamed men begging forgiveness, but as soldiers determined to earn back their honor.\n86-95\nFervor. The sacred oath ignites something deep. Men fall to their knees, crossing themselves, calling out their recommitment. The Romans watching take up the cry. The Vatican Guard is reborn in St. Peter's Square.\n96-100\nA Miracle of Faith. Something moves through the crowd—call it grace, call it providence. The guard does not merely recommit; they confess. Men step forward to name those who gave false orders, who paid bribes, who whispered against the Pope. The conspiracy unravels in the shadow of St. Peter's.\n\n\nRoll d100."

Some men cannot face their failure and turn their shame outward. The guard fragments.\n\nThis is going to be a tense moment. I need to portray this realistically - not everyone will turn against Juan, but enough will create a problem. Some may mutter, some may walk away, some may even show defiance.\n\nThis is the consequence of a failed persuasion roll. The approach was strong, but sometimes even good approaches fail. The men are broken, ashamed, and being publicly called out - some will respond to mercy, but others will harden.\n\nLet me write this carefully.

But in the silence of the square, it carries.\n\n\n\"Easy for a king to speak of oaths. He wasn't here.\"\n\n\nJuan cannot see who said it. But he sees the effect. Shoulders that had begun to bow in shame now stiffen. Jaws tighten. Eyes that had been downcast now look away—not in guilt, but in something harder.\n\n\nAnother voice, somewhere in the back: \"We had no orders. Pallavicini was dying. What were we supposed to do?\"\n\n\nCorsini turns, face reddening. \"Silence! The King is—\"\n\n\n\"The King is what?\" An older guard, a man with grey in his beard and scars on his hands, steps forward from the line. Not threatening—not quite—but not cowed either. \"The King sailed away to Constantinople. For a year. And now he returns and asks where our honor is?\"\n\n\nThought process: Examined psychological fragmentation and conflicting responses to failure.\n\nThis is the failure manifesting. The shame is too much, so they're turning it outward - blaming Juan for not being here, rather than accepting responsibility for their own failure.\n\nI need to show the fragmentation happening. Some will be defensive, some will simply be broken and apathetic, some may genuinely want redemption but be drowned out.\n\n\nHe gestures at the square, at Rome, at everything.\n\n\n\"Where was Castile when the riots started? Where was Castile when the Colonna came out of every alley in the city? We are Romans, Your Majesty. We are not your soldiers.\"\n\n\nMurmurs of agreement ripple through the formation. Not all—perhaps not even most—but enough. The fragile moment of potential redemption is cracking.\n\n\n\nTHE FRACTURE\n\n\nSome men kneel. Perhaps thirty, scattered through the ranks—men who heard Juan's words and felt the weight of their broken oath. They cross themselves, heads bowed, tears on some faces.\n\n\nBut others are already drifting away. Not running—just... leaving. Walking toward the edges of the square, shedding the papal colors as they go. A helmet dropped here. A halberd leaned against a pillar there. Men who have decided they are done with all of it.\n\n\nAnd in the middle—the majority—stand frozen. Caught between shame and resentment, between the men kneeling and the men walking away. They do not recommit. They do not leave. They simply stand, leaderless as they have been for three weeks, waiting for someone else to decide their fate.\n\n\nThe grey-bearded guard who spoke still stands at the front, arms crossed. Not hostile. But not yielding either.\n\n\n\"You want us to march to Florence, Your Majesty? To beg forgiveness from a Pope who fled?\" He shakes his head slowly. \"Some of us have families here. Children. We took this post because it was safe. Because Rome is home.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\n\"I am not a crusader. I am a Roman who took an oath I could not keep. And I am sorry for it. But I will not leave my family to chase absolution in Florence.\"\n\n\n\nTHE COUNT\n\n\nThe guard has fractured:\n\nGroup\nNumber\nStatus\nKneeling (recommitted)\n~30\nReady to serve\nDeparted (abandoned post)\n~40\nGone, scattered\nStanding (undecided)\n~90\nLeaderless, waiting\nDefiant (resentful)\n~3-5\nThe grey-beard and a few others\n\nThe Romans in the square are watching.

Juan is going to confront the Pope's nephew - the man whose grievance and whispered permission helped enable the collapse.\n\nThis is a significant moment. Condulmer is not a simple villain - he's a wounded man who felt betrayed by his uncle, and his passive-aggressive enabling of the chaos was born of that wound. But his actions (or inactions) contributed to the Pope's flight.\n\nI should narrate Juan entering the palace and confronting Condulmer. This will likely be tense - Condulmer has power within the Church (he's still a cardinal), and Juan needs to determine what to do with him.\n\nLet me set the scene properly.\n\n\nThe sixty-seven men stand straighter. It's not absolution—Juan made clear he cannot give that—but it's something. A path forward. A chance.\n\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty,\" Corsini says, his voice steadier now. \"We will leave at dawn.\"\n\n\n\nTHE VATICAN PALACE\n\n\nJuan leaves Rodrigo de Mendoza in command of the square and takes twenty of his Caballeros del Defensor with him. Isaac follows silently.\n\n\nThe great doors of the Vatican palace stand unguarded. Juan pushes through them into the entrance hall—a space he remembers from his first visit, when Pope Eugenius received him with cautious hope and they spoke of reform through the night.\n\n\nThe halls are quiet. Torches burn in their sconces, but the usual bustle of papal administration is absent. Servants peer from doorways and then vanish. A priest scurries past, head down, pretending not to see the armed men marching through the corridors.\n\n\nIsaac speaks quietly: \"The Cardinal has been using the reception chamber on the second floor. The one overlooking the square.\"\n\n\nJuan knows the room.\n\n\n\nTHE RECEPTION CHAMBER\n\n\nTwo men in household livery stand outside the door—not guards, just servants pressed into awkward duty. They see Juan coming and their faces drain of color.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty—the Cardinal is—he is receiving—\"\n\n\nJuan does not slow down.\n\n\nThe doors open.\n\n\n\nCARDINAL FRANCESCO CONDULMER\n\n\nThought process: Contextualized Cardinal's wounded motivations and positioned confrontation scene.\n\nCardinal Condulmer is the Pope's nephew. He was deeply wounded by being excluded from the Camera reform planning - he felt betrayed by his uncle. For thirteen months he nursed this grievance, and eventually his passive enabling of opposition helped precipitate the collapse.\n\nHe's not a simple villain. He's a wounded man whose hurt turned into something destructive. Juan visited him in Chapter 2.21 and tried to reach him, but the result was ambiguous - Condulmer said he would \"think on\" what Juan said.\n\nNow Juan confronts him after the disaster. Condulmer has been receiving visitors, positioning himself as a figure of \"healing\" and \"reconciliation\" - essentially filling the vacuum left by his uncle's flight.\n\nLet me set the scene. Condulmer would be with other visitors - cardinals, officials, merchants - the people Isaac mentioned. They're probably discussing what to do now that Juan has arrived. The mood would be tense.\n\n\nThe room is warm with candlelight. A fire burns in the hearth despite the mild spring evening. Around a table spread with wine and papers sit five men:\n\n\nCardinal Francesco Condulmer at the head—the Pope's nephew, a man in his forties with Eugenius's sharp features but none of his uncle's spiritual intensity. He looks up as Juan enters, and something flickers across his face. Fear? Defiance? It's hard to tell.\n\n\nTwo other cardinals—older men Juan does not recognize, wearing the red that marks their station. They rise from their seats in alarm.\n\n\nA papal secretary—ink-stained fingers, clutching a quill he was using to take notes.\n\n\nA merchant in fine Florentine clothes—Medici colors, Juan notes. The banker's representative, perhaps checking which way the wind blows.\n\n\nThe conversation dies instantly.\n\n\nCardinal Condulmer sets down his wine cup. Slowly. Deliberately.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His voice is controlled, careful. \"We did not expect you.\"\n\n\nHe does not rise. Does not bow. A small defiance, but a pointed one.\n\n\n\"I see you have... restored order in the city.\" His eyes flick to the window, to the torchlit square below where Juan's soldiers hold the Vatican. \"How very... efficient.\"\n\n\nThe two unknown cardinals exchange glances. The Medici man is already calculating, his eyes moving between Juan and Condulmer.\n\n\nCondulmer gestures to an empty chair.\n\n\n\"Will you sit, Your Majesty? We were just discussing the future of Rome.\""

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed persuasion tactics, power dynamics, and potential outcomes.\n\nThe player is sitting down and engaging directly with Cardinal Condulmer and the assembled men. Juan is making a strong opening move - essentially laying out accusations and framing the conversation around punishment and excommunication.\n\nThis is a persuasion attempt. Let me think about what Juan is actually trying to achieve here and what the factors are.\n\n**What is Juan trying to do?**\nHe's trying to intimidate/pressure Cardinal Condulmer and the others into acknowledging wrongdoing and accepting that there will be consequences. He's establishing that the narrative will be \"conspiracy against the Pope\" and that someone will be held accountable.\n\n**The situation:**\n- Juan has military control of Rome\n- Condulmer is the Pope's nephew who nursed a grievance for 13 months\n- Condulmer didn't directly order anything but \"created permission\" for the collapse\n- The other cardinals present are unknown - they could be conspirators or just opportunists\n- The Medici representative is calculating\n- Condulmer hasn't risen or bowed - a small defiance\n\n**What Juan is asking:**\nNot a specific action yet - he's framing the conversation, establishing dominance, and essentially demanding that Condulmer accept the framing of \"conspiracy requiring excommunication and prosecution.\"\n\n**Success factors:**\n- Juan holds absolute military power in Rome right now\n- The papal reform documents are legally valid\n- Eugenius is still Pope - his authority stands\n- Juan has already secured the bridges, the square, the guard\n- The Medici representative will side with whoever appears to be winning\n- The accusation is essentially true - someone enabled this collapse\n- Juan's reputation and moral authority (\"Il Re Crociato\")\n- Public opinion in Rome is turning Juan's way\n\n**Failure factors:**\n- Condulmer is the Pope's nephew - family complicates everything\n- Condulmer didn't technically DO anything illegal - he just stopped preventing\n- The other cardinals may close ranks (clergy protecting clergy)\n- Juan is a foreign king - ecclesiastical matters are supposed to be Church business\n\n\n- Condulmer has had 13 months to nurse grievance and 3 weeks to prepare\n- Potential compromising information or leverage exists\n- The \"hollow center\" revealed weak internal Church support\n- Excommunication requires papal authority, which Juan cannot directly order\n\nJuan's aggressive approach risks forcing a confrontation instead of securing capitulation. The delicate political landscape demands careful navigation, with multiple potential pitfalls threatening his strategic objectives.\n\n\nJuan sits. The chair scrapes against the stone floor. The Caballeros del Defensor take positions along the walls—twenty armed men in a room that suddenly feels very small.\n\n\nThe two unknown cardinals have gone pale. The Medici representative's calculating look has frozen into careful neutrality. The secretary has set down his quill, hands trembling slightly.\n\n\nOnly Condulmer maintains his composure. He takes a slow sip of wine.\n\n\n\"Excommunication,\" he repeats. \"Prosecution.\" He sets down the cup. \"Strong words, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\n\nPERSUASION: ESTABLISH THE NARRATIVE\n\n\nThe Ask: Accept that this was a conspiracy against papal authority. Accept that there will be consequences. Accept Juan's framing of events.\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\nJuan holds absolute military control of Rome\n\nThe accusation is essentially true—someone enabled this collapse\n\nEugenius remains Pope; his authority stands\n\nThe bridges, the square, the Camera, the guard—all now under Juan's control\n\nThe Medici will side with whoever is winning\n\nPublic opinion in Rome has turned—\"Il Re Crociato\" restoring order\n\nThe other cardinals are clearly frightened\n\nJuan's moral authority—a man of genuine faith, not political games\n\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\nCondulmer is the Pope's nephew—Eugenius may not want family punished\n\nCondulmer didn't technically do anything—he merely stopped preventing\n\nClergy protecting clergy—cardinals may close ranks\n\nJuan is a foreign king dictating Church matters—jurisdictional tension\n\nCondulmer has had three weeks to prepare his position\n\nExcommunication is a papal prerogative—Juan cannot actually order it\n\nCondulmer may have leverage or information Juan doesn't know about\n\nCornered men sometimes fight rather than submit\n\n\nApproach Quality: Strong. Direct. Clear framing. But aggressive—little room for Condulmer to save face. May force confrontation rather than capitulation.\n\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nDefiance. Condulmer has nothing left to lose. He pushes back hard—challenges Juan's authority, invokes Church jurisdiction, perhaps reveals something damaging. The other cardinals may rally to him.\n11-20\nStalemate. Condulmer neither accepts nor rejects. Legalistic deflection—\"these are matters for His Holiness to decide.\" The conversation goes in circles. Nothing is resolved.\n21-35\nPartial Retreat. Condulmer concedes some ground but protects himself. Blames the Colonna, blames Pallavicini, blames circumstances. Accepts the \"conspiracy\" framing but positions himself as bystander, not participant.\n36-50\nCracks Appear. The other cardinals begin distancing themselves from Condulmer. The Medici representative signals willingness to cooperate. Condulmer is increasingly isolated but not yet broken.\n51-65\nCapitulation Begins. Condulmer sees the writing on the wall. He doesn't confess, but he stops resisting. Offers to \"assist\" the investigation. The others follow his lead.\n66-80\nNames Given. Someone in the room—Condulmer or one of the others—begins providing information. Who gave orders. Who paid. Who coordinated with the Colonna. Self-preservation overrides solidarity.\n81-90\nFull Cooperation. Condulmer breaks. He offers everything—names, documents, the full picture of what happened. He begs for mercy, invoking his uncle's name. The conspiracy unravels.\n91-95\nConfession. Condulmer admits his role. Not as mastermind—but as the man who \"created permission.\" He throws himself on Juan's mercy, hoping his honesty will earn clemency from his uncle.\n96-100\nThe Serpent's Head. Someone in this room—perhaps Condulmer, perhaps another—reveals that this goes deeper than Rome. Basel. The French faction. A coordinated effort to break papal authority entirely. Juan has stumbled onto something larger.\n\n\nRoll d100."

He uses legalistic deflection, invokes Church jurisdiction, says these are matters for His Holiness to decide. The conversation goes in circles. Nothing is resolved.\n\nThis is a frustrating outcome for Juan - he has military control but Condulmer is stonewalling him with procedural and jurisdictional arguments. The Cardinal is playing for time, perhaps hoping that something will change, or simply refusing to give Juan the satisfaction of capitulation.\n\nLet me write this scene showing Condulmer's careful, lawyerly resistance without outright defiance.\n\n\n\nTHE STALEMATE\n\n\nCondulmer sets down his wine cup with deliberate care. His face arranges itself into an expression of patient reasonableness—the look of a man who has spent decades navigating papal politics.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty raises serious matters,\" he says. \"Very serious indeed. And I share your concern for the dignity of the Holy See.\"\n\n\nHe folds his hands on the table.\n\n\n\"But I must observe—with the deepest respect—that excommunication is a spiritual penalty.

One of them—an elderly man with a thin, pinched face—clears his throat.\n\n\n\"Cardinal Condulmer speaks wisely, Your Majesty. The Church has her own processes. Her own courts. To circumvent them would be to—\"\n\n\n\"To repeat the errors of emperors past,\" the other cardinal finishes. He's younger, perhaps fifty, with the soft hands of a man who has never held anything heavier than a pen. \"King Henry. Frederick Barbarossa. Temporal power reaching into spiritual matters never ends well.\"\n\n\nThey've found their footing now. Procedural ground. Jurisdictional arguments. The comfortable terrain of men who have spent their lives in committees and councils.\n\n\n\nCONDULMER CONTINUES\n\n\n\"As for the events of recent weeks,\" Condulmer says, spreading his hands in a gesture of helplessness, \"they were tragic. Chaotic. But Your Majesty must understand—Rome was in turmoil. The Holy Father departed... suddenly. There was confusion. Fear.\"\n\n\nHe shakes his head sadly.\n\n\n\"I did what I could to maintain order. I received visitors—yes. Cardinals, merchants, officials—men seeking guidance in a time of crisis. Was I to turn them away? To hide in my chambers while Rome burned?\"\n\n\nHis eyes meet Juan's.\n\n\n\"I am guilty of nothing more than trying to hold things together until proper authority could be restored.\"\n\n\nHe gestures at Juan, at the soldiers lining the walls.\n\n\n\"And now it has been. Thanks to Your Majesty's... intervention. For which the Church is grateful.\"\n\n\nThe word intervention hangs in the air. Pointed. A foreign king with soldiers in the Vatican.\n\n\n\nTHE MEDICI MAN\n\n\nThe merchant in Florentine colors has been silent throughout. Now he speaks, his voice carefully neutral.\n\n\n\"If I may, Your Majesty, Your Eminences—the House of Medici has no interest in these disputes. We served Pope Eugenius faithfully before his departure. We will serve him faithfully upon his return.\"\n\n\nHe inclines his head toward Juan.\n\n\n\"Cosimo de' Medici has already extended hospitality to His Holiness in Florence. The bank's loyalty is not in question.\"\n\n\nIt's a message: We're with whoever wins. Right now, that appears to be you. But we're not giving you anything you can use against anyone until we're certain.\n\n\n\nTHE CIRCLE\n\n\nCondulmer takes another sip of wine.\n\n\n\"So, Your Majesty. What would you have us do? I will gladly write to my uncle expressing my joy at your arrival and the restoration of order. I will support any investigation His Holiness wishes to conduct—through proper channels. I will cooperate fully with whatever processes the Church deems appropriate.\"\n\n\nHe smiles. It doesn't reach his eyes.\n\n\n\"But I cannot confess to crimes I did not commit. I cannot condemn men without evidence and trial. I am a cardinal of the Holy Roman Church, Your Majesty. Not a brigand to be bullied into false testimony.\"\n\n\nThe fire crackles. The candles flicker. Twenty armed men stand along the walls, and none of it matters, because Condulmer has found the one ground where swords are useless: procedure.\n\n\nHe's not defying Juan. He's simply... waiting. Deflecting. Running out the clock until someone else decides what happens next.\n\n\nIsaac catches Juan's eye from the corner. A slight shake of the head. This approach isn't working."

The focus should be on what Juan learns during this waiting period.\n\n\n\nTHE WAIT\n\n\nLate April - Early May 1435\n\n\nThe days pass. Juan's men hold their positions. Rome settles into an uneasy calm.\n\n\n\nINFORMATION EMERGES\n\n\nDay 2 — Enzo Colonna Talks\n\n\nEnzo proves eager to cooperate. He provides names: the men who recruited him, the intermediaries who passed orders, the cousins who organized the retainers.\n\n\n\"The orders came through a man named Vittorio Colonna—another minor cousin. He claimed to speak for the Cardinal in the Campagna. But I never saw a letter with the Cardinal's seal. Never.\"\n\n\nHe draws a rough map of the Colonna network in Rome. Lesser cousins. Retainers. Safe houses.\n\n\n\"Vittorio fled the city two days before you arrived, Your Majesty. Someone warned him.\"\n\n\n\nDay 4 — The Camera Records\n\n\nDiego de Salazar and his men secure the Camera building thoroughly. In a locked chest beneath the floorboards of a clerk's office, they find documents that should not exist: copies of correspondence between Cardinal Condulmer and Basel.\n\n\nThe letters are careful—nothing explicitly treasonous. But they discuss \"new arrangements\" and \"the will of the Council\" and \"opportunities that may arise should circumstances change in Rome.\"\n\n\nOne letter, dated March 15th, references \"our friend from Lyon\" and \"his visit to discuss matters of mutual interest.\"\n\n\nThe French priest.\n\n\n\nDay 6 — A Witness Comes Forward\n\n\nA Vatican servant—a cook named Maria—approaches Diego's men at the Camera. She is frightened but determined.\n\n\n\"I served the Cardinal's table,\" she says. \"I heard things. The night before the riots, there was a meeting. Late. The French priest was there. And another man—not Italian. He spoke Latin with a strange accent. German, maybe.\"\n\n\nShe wrings her hands.\n\n\n\"They talked about 'the signal.' About 'when the bread runs out.' I didn't understand then. But the riots started the next day.\"\n\n\n\nDay 9 — Eugenius Approaches\n\n\nWord arrives: Pope Eugenius IV has departed Florence with an escort of Florentine soldiers provided by Cosimo de' Medici. The sixty-seven Vatican Guards reached him and threw themselves at his feet. He received them.\n\n\nHe will arrive in Rome within three days.\n\n\n\nWHAT JUAN NOW KNOWS\n\nEvidence\nImplication\nEnzo Colonna's testimony\nColonna retainers organized through intermediaries, not direct orders from Cardinal Colonna\nVittorio Colonna's flight\nSomeone in Rome warned him—a leak exists\nCamera correspondence\nCondulmer was in contact with Basel discussing \"new arrangements\"\nReference to \"friend from Lyon\"\nFrench involvement confirmed\nMaria the cook's testimony\nThe grain riots were deliberately triggered (\"the signal\")\nGerman-accented visitor\nBasel sent more than one agent\n\nThe picture emerges: not a Roman coup, but a coordinated operation. Basel. The French faction. Colonna opportunism. Condulmer as the man who \"opened the door.\"\n\n\n\nIsaac reviews the evidence with Juan on the evening of the ninth day.\n\n\n\"It's not complete, Your Majesty. We have no letter with Condulmer's signature ordering anything. We have no confession. A good advocate could argue coincidence and circumstance.\"\n\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\n\"But it is enough for His Holiness to ask hard questions. And enough for the Church to investigate properly.\"\n\n\nHe glances toward the Vatican Palace, where Condulmer remains confined.\n\n\n\"The Cardinal has been very quiet these nine days. I wonder what he is thinking.\""

The Pope had the authority to invest (grant) the kingdom to rulers\n2. The ruler of Naples owed feudal allegiance to the Pope\n3. In disputed successions, the Pope's decision carried significant weight\n\nThe current situation in the campaign:\n- Queen Giovanna II of Naples is dying (Chapter 2.32 mentioned she would die by Autumn 1435)\n- Alfonso V of Aragon claims Naples (Juan's cousin and ally)\n- René of Anjou is the rival claimant, backed by France\n- There was a major campaign in 1434 where Juan sent 15,000 Castilian troops to help Alfonso\n\nThe Pope technically has the right to invest the King of Naples since it's a papal fief. This goes back to the Norman conquest of southern Italy when the Normans received their kingdom from the Pope.\n\nI should have Eugenius explain this - that Naples is a papal fief, that the Pope can grant investiture, but also explain the complications (French pressure, other claimants, political realities).\n\n\n\nEugenius nods slowly, his expression thoughtful.\n\n\n\"Naples. Yes.\"\n\n\nHe sighs, the weight of papal politics settling visibly on his shoulders.\n\n\n\"The Kingdom of Naples is a papal fief, Juan. It has been since the Normans carved it from the Byzantines and the Saracens, and Pope Nicholas II granted them legitimacy in exchange for fealty. The king of Naples holds his crown from the Pope. He pays annual tribute—the census—and in return, the Holy See guarantees his rule.\"\n\n\nHe guides his horse around a cluster of cheering Romans, blessing them absently.\n\n\n\"When succession is disputed, the Pope has the right—some would say the duty—to determine the rightful heir. To grant investiture. Without papal investiture, a claimant to Naples is merely a man with an army. With it, he is the anointed king.\"\n\n\nHis voice grows more cautious.\n\n\n\"But you understand the complications. René of Anjou has French support.

We reject and declare invalid any competing claims that contradict the lawful rights of the Crown of Aragón to said kingdom.\n\nWe shall write to all Christian monarchs explaining the justice of this claim and urging their recognition and support. We call upon all faithful princes to support King Alfonso's lawful right to Naples and to reject the claims of those who would dispute his inheritance.\n\nThis support is given in recognition of the alliance between Castile and Aragón, both of which have served the Church faithfully, and in acknowledgment that the consolidation of Christian power in the Mediterranean serves the greater cause of defending Christendom against the Turkish threat.\"\n\nSo Juan is correct - the Pope already declared support for Alfonso's claim in April 1433.

I should read the chapter-end skill to see what actions need to be performed at the end of a chapter.\n\n\nView: Reading the chapter-end skill to see what actions to perform\n\n\nThought process: Synthesized chapter events and compiled character database updates.\n\nNow I need to create the chapter summary document and the CHARACTER_DATABASE.md updates. Let me identify the chapter number first - this appears to be Chapter 2.35 based on the context (the user mentioned we're in Chapter 2.35 set in February 1435 Constantinople in the system prompt memories, though this chapter covers events in late April/early May 1435 in Rome).\n\nLet me compile all the information from this chapter:\n\n**Basic Info:**\n- Chapter: 2.35\n- Dates: Late April - Early May 1435\n- Locations: Ostia, Rome (Trastevere, Ponte Sisto, Ponte Sant'Angelo, St. Peter's Square, Vatican Palace, Castel Sant'Angelo)\n\n**Events:**\n- Juan arrived at Ostia from Constantinople to find papal messenger (Diego de Salazar) with news of Pope's flight\n- War council held at Ostia docks\n- March on Rome with ~200 men\n- Bloodless capture of Ponte Sisto (roll 100)\n- Bloodless capture of Ponte Sant'Angelo\n- Meeting with Enzo Colonna who surrendered and cooperated\n- Confrontation with Vatican Guard - some recommitted, many left (roll 10)\n- 67 guards chose to march to Florence to seek Pope's forgiveness\n- Securing the Vatican Palace\n- Confrontation with Cardinal Condulmer (roll 19 - stalemate)\n- Cardinals Sforza and Castiglione provided testimony\n- Bernardo de' Bardi (Medici factor) provided intelligence\n- Securing Castel Sant'Angelo, meeting Ser Giacomo Tartaglia\n- Days of waiting while gathering evidence (roll 59 - information emerges)\n- Pope Eugenius returns to Rome\n- Conversation about Swiss Guard, Naples confirmation\n\n**NPCs Encountered:**\n- Diego de Salazar (Castilian observer, wounded, leader of the 10)\n\n\n- Isaac (advisor)\n- Tomas (administrator)\n- Rodrigo de Mendoza (Commander of Los Caballeros del Defensor)\n- Enzo Colonna (minor cousin, surrendered, cooperated)\n- Corsini (Vatican Guard lieutenant)\n- Cardinal Francesco Condulmer (Pope's nephew, confined)\n- Cardinal Sforza (minor cardinal, cooperative)\n- Cardinal Castiglione (minor cardinal, cooperative)\n- Bernardo de' Bardi (Medici factor)\n- Ser Giacomo\n\nI'll categorize the key personnel involved in this chapter's events, focusing on their roles and interactions during the Rome operation. The group includes strategic advisors like Isaac and Tomas, military leadership such as Rodrigo de Mendoza, local Roman contacts like Enzo Colonna, and various ecclesiastical figures who played crucial parts in the unfolding narrative.\n\nTartaglia (castellan of Castel Sant'Angelo)\n- Pope Eugenius IV\n- Tommaso Parentucelli\n- Fray Hernando de Talavera\n- Maria the cook (witness)\n\nThe scene unfolds in early May 1435, with significant developments in Rome's power dynamics. Key rolls reveal a complex political landscape: the Pope's return, a bloodless capture of Ponte Sisto, and fractured institutional loyalties. Tensions simmer among Vatican Guard members, with persuasion attempts yielding mixed results and information gradually emerging.\n\nUnresolved threads point to a deeper conspiracy involving Cardinal Condulmer, Basel connections, and strategic movements by the Colonna faction. The backdrop includes potential shifts in papal politics, with implications for Church reforms, military orders, and regional power balances. Vittorio Colonna's mysterious flight suggests an intricate web of warnings and counter-movements.\n\nEmerging intelligence highlights deliberate grain riots, covert meetings, and international intrigue involving French and German intermediaries. The Camera's correspondence hints at imminent \"new arrangements,\" while broader geopolitical tensions—including the Ottoman truce and Naples' uncertain succession—create a volatile political environment.\n\n\n\nChapter 2.35 Complete\n\n\nI have prepared the chapter documentation:\n\n\n\nChapter 2.35 Summary\n\n\nThe Return to Rome\n\n\nBasic Information\n\n\nChapter: 2.35\n\nDates: Late April – Early May 1435\n\nLocations: Ostia, Rome (Trastevere, Ponte Sisto, Ponte Sant'Angelo, St. Peter's Square, Vatican Palace, Castel Sant'Angelo)\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nArrival at Ostia\n\n\nJuan arrived from Constantinople expecting to meet Pope in Rome\n\nDiscovered papal messenger was Diego de Salazar (one of the 10 Castilian observers left behind)\n\nLearned Pope Eugenius fled Rome on April 3, 1435, three weeks prior\n\nPope in exile in Florence with Parentucelli and Fray Hernando\n\n\nWar Council at Ostia\n\n\nAssessed available forces: 50 Caballeros del Defensor, ~120 support troops, 7 Rome escape survivors\n\nKey personnel: Isaac, Tomas, Rodrigo de Mendoza (commander of elite guard)\n\nDecision: March on Rome immediately, exploit surprise\n\n\nMarch on Rome\n\n\nIsaac sent ahead to scout Ponte Sisto\n\nColumn marched 15 miles from Ostia to Rome\n\nBanner kept furled until entering the city\n\nEntered through Porta Portuensis into Trastevere\n\n\nCapture of Ponte Sisto (Roll: 100 – Bloodless)\n\n\n32 Colonna retainers guarding the bridge\n\nUpon seeing the Castilian banner and 200 armed men, defenders simply abandoned their posts\n\nNo fighting, no casualties\n\n11 prisoners taken; rest fled into Trastevere\n\n20 men left to hold the bridge\n\n\nCapture of Ponte Sant'Angelo (Roll: 100 – Bloodless)\n\n\n40-50 Colonna retainers in disarray, already arguing about fleeing\n\nEnzo Colonna (minor cousin, leader) surrendered immediately\n\nThrew down sword, asked for terms\n\nJuan framed it as \"deception\" – Enzo cooperated fully\n\nBridge secured; Enzo kept under guard as cooperative witness\n\n\nSt. Peter's Square – The Vatican Guard\n\n\nConfronted ~163 Vatican Guards under Lieutenant Corsini\n\nCaptain Pallavicini still ill\n\nJuan demanded they account for their broken oaths\n\n\nPersuasion to Vatican Guard (Roll: 10 – Shame Hardens to Resentment)\n\n\nGuard fractured badly\n\n~30 knelt and recommitted immediately\n\n~40 abandoned their posts entirely\n\n~90 stood frozen, undecided\n\nGrey-bearded veteran challenged Juan: \"Easy for a king to speak of oaths.
