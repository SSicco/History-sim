The excitement of yesterday's discussions with Hunyadi still lingers, but today requires attention to more immediate matters. Álvaro has brought several items requiring decisions, including updates from Granada about the fortress commanders' responses and the question of what to do with the crusader force now that their oaths are technically fulfilled.\n\n\nHe sets down a leather document case on the table between you. \"Your Majesty, we have responses from two of the three Sierra Nevada fortress commanders. And Fray Hernando has requested an audience about the crusaders - apparently they're asking about their future now that Granada has fallen.\"\n\n\nThe constable pauses, organizing his thoughts. \"Also, Diego has been reviewing the Mediterranean commerce proposals and wants clarification on some details.

This is a practical concern for someone planning to develop major trade operations. I need to:\n\n1. Provide realistic information about Mediterranean piracy in the 1430s\n2. Identify main pirate bases and threats\n3. Discuss countermeasures available\n4. Keep it in character for Álvaro's knowledge and perspective\n\nLet me think about 1430s Mediterranean piracy:\n\nMain threats would include:\n- Barbary corsairs from North African ports (Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, etc.)\n- Ottoman-aligned pirates\n- Some Christian pirates/privateers\n- Rogue elements\n\nCountermeasures in this era:\n- Naval escorts for merchant convoys\n- Treaties/tribute with certain powers\n- Fortified ports\n- Armed merchant vessels\n- Intelligence networks\n- Periodic punitive raids\n\nÁlvaro would know this from his strategic planning experience. He'd be practical and realistic about the threats.\n\nI should keep this response relatively short (2-4 paragraphs) since we're in active conversation, and stop after presenting the information to let Juan respond.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods at the question, clearly having anticipated this concern. He leans back in his chair, fingers steepled thoughtfully.\n\n\n\"Piracy will absolutely remain a threat, Your Majesty. The Mediterranean has never been truly safe, and Granada's fall won't change the fundamental reality - there's too much wealth moving by sea for predators to ignore.\"\n\n\nHe begins ticking off the main concerns on his fingers. \"The primary threat comes from the Barbary Coast - Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, and smaller ports along North Africa. These operate with varying degrees of organization. Some are essentially state-sponsored, others are independent corsairs who pay tribute for harbor rights. They prey primarily on Christian shipping, taking both cargo and captives for ransom or slavery. It's enormously profitable for them.\"\n\n\n\"Then there are Ottoman-aligned raiders operating from eastern Mediterranean ports. Less immediate threat to our western trade routes, but they make the entire sea dangerous. And we can't discount Christian pirates either - Catalan corsairs, rogue Genoese, various opportunists. When trade is rich and enforcement is weak, piracy flourishes regardless of faith.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, gauging your reaction. \"The Genoese and Venetians manage this through several methods: armed merchant vessels, convoy systems with naval escorts, treaties with certain North African powers - essentially tribute payments in exchange for safe passage - and periodic punitive expeditions to remind pirates there are consequences. It's never eliminated, just... managed to acceptable levels of loss.\"\n\n\n\"For Málaga specifically, the closest major pirate bases would be along the Moroccan and Algerian coasts - probably 100-200 miles south across the strait. Close enough to raid our shipping but far enough that pursuit is difficult.\" He meets your eyes directly. \"The question is how much we're willing to spend to protect our commerce. Naval patrols are expensive. Armed escorts reduce cargo capacity. Treaties require ongoing payments. Each approach has costs.\"\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on how to address this threat?"

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed military feasibility, political ramifications, and strategic complications.\n\nThis is a great strategic question. Juan is thinking about controlling the Strait of Gibraltar to secure Mediterranean access. Let me think about the military, political, and practical realities of this in 1432.\n\n**Geography of the Strait:**\n- Northern side: Gibraltar itself (currently Granada territory, so now Juan's), plus coastal areas\n- Southern side: Ceuta, Tangier, and other Moroccan ports\n\n**Historical context:**\n- Portugal historically took Ceuta in 1415 (17 years ago in this timeline)\n- This was a major Portuguese achievement\n- Ceuta was strategically important for controlling the strait\n\n**Military considerations:**\n- Juan just conquered Granada - his forces are experienced and successful\n- He has naval capability from the Genoese contracts\n- Morocco is not as militarily organized as Granada was\n- But it's still a significant undertaking\n\n**Political considerations:**\n- This would be extending the crusade into North Africa\n- Portugal might have interests/concerns (they took Ceuta historically)\n- This aligns with Juan's \"perpetual crusade\" concept\n- Would need to consider Portuguese reaction since Isabel is Portuguese\n\n**Practical considerations:**\n- Supply lines across water\n- Garrison requirements for captured ports\n- Cost of maintaining control\n- Whether this helps or hinders the Constantinople plans\n\nÁlvaro would analyze this strategically - he's proven to be a careful, thoughtful advisor who considers multiple angles. He'd probably see both the strategic value and the complications.\n\nLet me have Álvaro respond thoughtfully to this proposal.\n\n\nÁlvaro's eyes light up with recognition. \"Controlling both sides of the strait...\" He leans forward, clearly intrigued by the strategic vision. \"That would fundamentally change the Mediterranean equation.\"\n\n\nHe stands and moves to the window, looking south as if he could see the strait from here. \"The northern side we effectively control already - Gibraltar fortress is ours with Granada's fall, along with the entire coast. The southern side is Morocco, primarily Ceuta and Tangier. Those are the key ports.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to face you. \"Militarily, it's feasible. Our army is battle-hardened, we have the Genoese fleet under contract for several more months, and Moroccan coastal defenses are nothing compared to what we just conquered in Granada. Ceuta especially - it's somewhat isolated from the main Moroccan power centers inland. Morocco's strength lies in their cavalry and interior kingdoms, not coastal fortifications.\"\n\n\n\"But...\" He raises a hand. \"Several complications to consider carefully.\"\n\n\n\"First: Portugal. King João took Ceuta in 1415 - seventeen years ago. It was a great Portuguese triumph, their first step beyond Iberia. If Portugal still holds it, taking it would be... problematic for our alliance. If they've since lost it, that's different. I don't actually know Ceuta's current status - we'd need to confirm.\"\n\n\n\"Second: garrison requirements. Every port we take on the Moroccan coast requires permanent troops to hold. Unlike Granada where we're integrating existing population, these would be isolated strongholds in potentially hostile territory. Expensive to maintain, dependent on sea supply.\"\n\n\n\"Third: this extends the crusade significantly. Not necessarily a problem given your 'perpetual crusade' vision, but it does mean ongoing military commitments rather than consolidation.\" He pauses. \"Though perhaps that's exactly what you want - active crusading as permanent policy rather than occasional campaign.\"\n\n\nHe returns to his seat. \"The strategic benefits are considerable, though. Control both sides of the strait and we can: regulate all Mediterranean traffic, collect tolls from ships passing through, prevent Moroccan raiders from easily reaching our coast, create a stranglehold on trade between Mediterranean and Atlantic, and establish forward bases for any further North African operations.\"\n\n\n\"It would make Castile the gatekeeper of the Mediterranean. Venice and Genoa would have to negotiate with us for Atlantic access. That's... that's extraordinary leverage.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you seriously. \"So the questions are: What is Ceuta's current status? Are we willing to potentially complicate Portuguese relations? Can we afford the garrison costs? And most importantly - does this serve your larger strategic vision for the crusade, or does it distract from Constantinople and the Ottomans?\"\n\n\nWhat's your thinking on these concerns?"

      "say": "Thought process: Reconciled historical facts with diplomatic concerns regarding Portuguese holdings.\n\nThe user wants to find out about Ceuta's current status. Historically, Portugal did take Ceuta in 1415, and they held it for a very long time (actually still hold it today as a Spanish exclave after various transfers). In 1432, Portugal would definitely still control Ceuta - it was one of their most important overseas possessions and a point of great pride.\n\nI should have Álvaro either:\n1. Know this information (it's a major event from 17 years ago, he'd be aware)\n2. Offer to send inquiries to confirm\n\nGiven that this was a major Portuguese achievement and Álvaro is well-informed about Iberian politics, he would likely know this. It's not obscure information - Portugal taking Ceuta was a huge deal in 1415, celebrated throughout Christian Europe.\n\nI should provide this information clearly, then discuss alternatives for controlling the strait without taking Ceuta from Portugal. This might include:\n- Taking Tangier or other Moroccan ports\n- Negotiating with Portugal for joint control/cooperation\n- Building up Gibraltar on the northern side\n- Establishing a different North African base\n\nThe user is being thoughtful about not damaging the Portuguese alliance, which is good character consistency for Juan.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods appreciatively at your caution. \"Let me see what I know, and then we can confirm if necessary.\"\n\n\nHe thinks for a moment. \"Ceuta... yes, Portugal took it in 1415. King João himself led that expedition - it was a massive undertaking, his defining military achievement. Prince Duarte and Prince Henrique both fought there.\" He pauses. \"Actually, Henrique - Henry - has become somewhat obsessed with further African ventures since then. They call him 'the Navigator' in some circles.\"\n\n\n\"As for whether they still hold it...\" Álvaro considers. \"I've heard nothing suggesting they lost it. Portuguese merchants certainly act as though they control the strait's southern approach. And it would have been significant news if Morocco had retaken such a symbolically important fortress. So yes, I believe Portugal still holds Ceuta as of now.\"\n\n\nHe strokes his beard thoughtfully. \"Which means taking it would indeed severely damage our alliance. Isabel's father personally conquered that city. Taking it from Portugal would be... well, it would be declaring that family ties mean nothing compared to strategic ambition. Not the message we want to send, especially with Isabel having just borne your daughter.\"\n\n\n\"However,\" he continues, \"there are other Moroccan ports that could serve similar purposes. Tangier is perhaps 30 miles west of Ceuta - another major port on the strait, currently Moroccan-held. Or we could look at ports further west along the Atlantic coast of Morocco - Larache, Asilah. These would give us bases to interdict piracy without directly controlling the strait itself.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"Or we could approach this differently entirely. What if we proposed a joint venture with Portugal? They hold Ceuta, we hold Gibraltar and Málaga. Together we control both sides and could coordinate patrols, share intelligence, perhaps even create a formal toll system that benefits both kingdoms. That strengthens the alliance rather than threatening it.\"\n\n\n\"Portugal already has experience operating overseas garrisons. They might welcome Castilian cooperation rather than seeing it as competition. Especially if we frame it as protecting Christian commerce from Muslim pirates rather than territorial conquest.\"\n\n\nWhat approach appeals to you?"

      "say": "Thought process: Synthesized trade infrastructure needs and African-Mediterranean commerce strategy.\n\nJuan is asking about two things:\n1. Whether they need additional port facilities beyond what's already budgeted\n2. Whether they can promote trade between Africa and the internal Mediterranean\n\nThis is a great economic question. Let me think about what Álvaro would know:\n\nFrom the budget documents, they're already planning infrastructure investments for Mediterranean commerce - harbor improvements, customs houses, etc. The question is whether more is needed.\n\nFor the second question about African-Mediterranean trade, this is interesting. The trans-Saharan gold trade was huge, and there was significant trade between North Africa and Europe. Málaga and other Andalusian ports were historically important for this. With Granada conquered, Castile is positioned to become a major intermediary.\n\nÁlvaro would understand:\n- Current trade patterns (Italian city-states dominate)\n- What goods flow where (African gold, spices, slaves; European manufactured goods, grain)\n- The competitive landscape (Genoa, Venice, Aragon all established)\n- Infrastructure needs (warehousing, customs facilities, merchant communities)\n- Regulatory frameworks needed\n\nThis should be a substantive discussion about economic strategy, but not overly long - Juan asked a focused question and Álvaro should give focused answers with some elaboration.\n\n\nÁlvaro considers this carefully, clearly pleased you're thinking in terms of economic systems rather than just military campaigns.\n\n\n\"The harbor facilities we've budgeted - the customs houses, warehouse improvements, docking repairs - those are essential foundation. But if you want Málaga to become a major trading hub rather than just a functional port, we'll need more.\"\n\n\nHe counts off on his fingers. \"Merchants need certain things to establish permanent operations: secure warehousing for valuable goods, money-changing facilities since we're dealing with multiple currencies, lodging for foreign traders - Genoese, Venetians, even Muslims from across the Mediterranean. Málaga had some of this under Granada, but it was oriented toward Muslim trade networks. We need to rebuild for Christian commerce while not completely alienating Muslim merchants who know the African routes.\"\n\n\n\"The Genoese are already interested - they see the opportunity. But Venetians, Catalans, even merchants from France and the Low Countries... they'll come if the infrastructure supports them and the terms are attractive. That means merchant quarters, protected facilities, fair customs rates, and reliable enforcement of contracts.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then addresses your second question. \"As for African-Mediterranean trade - Your Majesty, this is potentially more valuable than our direct commerce. North Africa has gold, ivory, spices coming up from deeper Africa through the trans-Saharan routes. The Italian city-states have made fortunes being intermediaries for this trade. If we can position Málaga as the western gateway...\"\n\n\n\"Right now, much of that trade flows through Tunis, Alexandria, and other eastern ports. The Venetians and Genoese maintain trading posts there, pay tribute, navigate complex political relationships. But there's always been a western route too - Morocco, Algeria, through Granada to the Mediterranean. Under Muslim rule, Christian merchants had limited access. Now with us controlling both the coast and the interior approach, we can become the preferred route.\"\n\n\nHe grows more animated. \"Imagine: African gold and goods land at Moroccan ports, travel overland through agreements we negotiate, reach Málaga, then distribute throughout Christian Europe via our facilities. Or reverse it - European goods flow through Málaga to African markets. We collect customs at both ends and provide the secure route in between.\"\n\n\n\"This requires several things, though. First, treaties with Moroccan powers - particularly the Marinid dynasty or whoever controls the coast opposite us. They need to see benefit in routing trade through our ports rather than going east to Tunis. Second, safe overland routes through southern Granada - which we now control. Third, Muslim merchants willing to use our ports despite Christian rule. That means guaranteeing their safety, property rights, and religious freedom while they conduct business.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you seriously. \"It also means we need a different approach to our Muslim subjects in Granada than simple conversion pressure. If we want to tap into these trading networks, we need Muslim merchants who can vouch for us to their colleagues across the strait. We need to be seen as a safe place for Muslim commerce, not a threat.\"\n\n\n\"The Venetians manage this successfully - they trade with Muslims, employ Muslims, maintain relationships across religious lines when profit requires it. We could do the same. Make Málaga a neutral ground where Christian and Muslim merchants both operate freely under royal protection.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"So to answer your question: yes, we need additional facilities beyond basic harbor improvements if we want to capture this trade. Probably another 15,000-20,000 florins invested over 2-3 years - merchant quarters, warehouses, money-changing houses, legal frameworks for foreign traders. And we need diplomatic missions to North African powers offering trade agreements.\"\n\n\n\"But the potential revenue...\" He smiles. \"The Italian city-states built empires on exactly this intermediary role. Why shouldn't Castile?\"\n\n\nWhat's your reaction to this vision?"

This is historically appropriate for Juan II of Castile in 1432. They're saying they need to consult with the Church about what's permissible regarding Muslim merchants.\n\nThis is good roleplaying - Juan would need to balance economic pragmatism with religious orthodoxy, and the Church would have opinions on allowing Muslims to operate freely in Christian ports.\n\nThe player also raises an excellent point about Seville - it IS a major port and would compete with Málaga. Álvaro should address this competition/complementarity.\n\nI should have Álvaro acknowledge the religious concerns respectfully, suggest what Church consultation might reveal (Venice has precedents, temporary Muslim presence for commerce vs. permanent residency, etc.), and then address the Seville question thoroughly.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods immediately, no disagreement in his expression. \"Of course, Your Majesty. I wasn't suggesting we allow Muslim settlement or practice of their faith openly in our cities. But there's precedent for temporary presence of Muslim merchants conducting business - Venice does this, Genoa does this, even Barcelona. They arrive, conduct trade, and depart. They're not residents, they're visitors under royal protection for specific commercial purposes.\"\n\n\n\"But you're absolutely right to consult the Church on what's permissible. Cardinal Capranica or the Archbishop of Toledo could advise on how other Christian kingdoms handle this. There are theological distinctions between tolerating permanent Muslim communities versus allowing temporary commercial contact. The Church generally permits the latter as long as there's no proselytizing and Christians aren't led astray.\"\n\n\nHe shifts to your second question, clearly relieved to move to less theologically complex territory.\n\n\n\"Seville! Yes, excellent point. Seville is indeed a major port - actually the major port of Castile currently. It sits on the Guadalquivir River with access to the Atlantic, handles most of our wool exports to Flanders, receives goods from Portugal and beyond. It's wealthy, well-established, has the merchant infrastructure already in place.\"\n\n\n\"But,\" he raises a finger, \"Seville and Málaga serve different markets and could complement rather than compete. Seville is Atlantic-facing - perfect for trade with northern Europe, England, Flanders, France, Portugal. The wool trade, Atlantic fisheries, northern goods. Málaga is Mediterranean-facing - Italian city-states, eastern Mediterranean, North African coast, potentially the Levant.\"\n\n\n\"Think of it as two different trade networks. A Flemish merchant wanting Spanish wool goes to Seville. A Venetian merchant wanting access to African gold or wanting to ship eastern spices westward goes to Málaga. They're serving different customers and different routes.\"\n\n\nHe warms to the explanation. \"Additionally, Málaga has geographic advantages Seville lacks for Mediterranean trade. Seville requires sailing up a river - possible but time-consuming and limiting for ship size. Málaga is directly on the coast with excellent harbor. For a Genoese captain wanting to move quickly between Barcelona, Málaga, and back to Genoa, the direct coastal access matters greatly.\"\n\n\n\"There's also the question of capacity. Seville is busy. Very busy. If we dramatically increase Castile's overall trade volume, Seville alone won't be able to handle everything. Having a second major port makes sense. England doesn't rely solely on London - they have Bristol, Southampton, others. Italy has Genoa, Venice, Pisa, Naples. Multiple ports create redundancy and specialization.\"\n\n\nHe leans back. \"That said, Seville's merchant families will watch this carefully. They've grown wealthy on their near-monopoly of Castilian maritime trade. If they perceive Málaga as threat rather than complement, they could create political difficulties. We should probably be clear from the beginning: Seville handles Atlantic and northern trade, Málaga handles Mediterranean and southern trade. Different markets, both profitable, both serving the kingdom.\"\n\n\n\"We might even incentivize some Sevillian merchants to open operations in Málaga - give them first opportunity for licenses, favorable terms. That way they profit from Mediterranean expansion rather than resenting it. Make them partners in the venture.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Does that address your concern about competition? Or do you see it differently?\""

This is historically what both Portugal and Spain actually did (Portugal took Ceuta in 1415, Spain later took Melilla, Oran, etc.). So it's completely plausible within the alternate history context.\n\nÁlvaro should provide a balanced analysis covering:\n1. Military feasibility (we just conquered Granada, have experienced army)\n2. Strategic benefits (forward bases against piracy, trade control, crusade continuation)\n3. Costs (garrison requirements, ongoing expenses, stretched forces)\n4. Political factors (crusade authority, noble support, church backing)\n5. Geographic targets (which ports make sense)\n6. Comparison to Portugal's approach\n7. Integration with larger strategic vision (Constantinople, perpetual crusade)\n\nThis is a major strategic decision, so Álvaro should be thorough but not overwhelming. He should present the analysis clearly and ask probing questions to help Juan think through the implications.\n\nI need to keep the response to 2-4 paragraphs since this is an active conversation/decision point.\n\n\nÁlvaro's expression grows thoughtful, clearly weighing this seriously. \"Yes, it could absolutely make sense. Portugal's approach with Ceuta provides a proven model - a well-planned amphibious assault on a coastal fortress, followed by permanent garrison to hold it. They've maintained Ceuta for seventeen years now despite periodic Moroccan attempts to retake it.\"\n\n\nHe stands and begins pacing, thinking aloud. \"The strategic logic is sound. Coastal fortresses on the African side give us: forward bases to interdict piracy before it reaches our shores, control points for trade routes, secure harbors for our ships operating in those waters, and staging grounds for any deeper operations into North Africa. Most importantly, it continues the crusade in practical terms - we're not just holding conquered territory, we're actively extending Christian control.\"\n\n\n\"Militarily, we could do it. Our army is experienced, battle-hardened from Granada. The Genoese fleet is still under contract. Moroccan coastal fortresses are generally weaker than what we just conquered - Granada's defenses were extraordinary by any standard. A target like Tangier or Melilla would face perhaps 1,000-2,000 defenders at most, nothing like the 8,000 we faced at Granada city.\"\n\n\nHe returns to his seat, leaning forward intently. \"The costs are significant though. Each fortress requires a permanent garrison - probably 500-800 troops minimum for a major port, supplied entirely by sea since we can't rely on the surrounding territory. That's expensive. Portugal spends heavily maintaining Ceuta. And unlike Granada where we're integrating the population, these would be isolated strongholds in hostile territory. Every garrison is a permanent drain on resources with no local tax base to support it.\"\n\n\n\"There's also the question of timing and priorities. We've just completed an 18-month campaign. The troops need rest, the nobles want to return to their estates, and we have Constantinople potentially looming. Do we immediately launch another major operation, or do we consolidate what we've gained?\" He pauses. \"Though I suppose taking one or two ports is far less demanding than the full Granada conquest. A focused operation - three months perhaps, limited objectives.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"The targets that make most strategic sense: Melilla is closest to Málaga, small but well-positioned. Tangier is the major prize on the strait if Portugal doesn't object to us operating so close to Ceuta. Further west along the Atlantic coast, Larache or Asilah would give us control over pirate bases there. Or we could look at ports further east along the Mediterranean coast - Oran, Algiers even, though those are more ambitious.\"\n\n\n\"Here's what I'd suggest,\" Álvaro says carefully. \"We could plan a limited operation for late 1433 or early 1434. Give the army a rest through winter and spring, use the Te Deum ceremony in April to gauge which nobles would commit troops for an African venture, and launch a focused campaign to take one or two key ports. Not a full conquest like Granada - just securing strategic points.\"\n\n\n\"The crusade authority supports this perfectly. The papal bull doesn't limit you to Iberia - it authorizes holy war against the infidel. North Africa certainly qualifies. And it demonstrates to Christendom that you're serious about perpetual crusade, not just completing the Reconquista and stopping.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"But this needs to fit with your larger vision. If Constantinople is the priority, do we want to commit resources to North Africa? Or does North Africa serve Constantinople by building naval experience, maintaining crusade momentum, and generating revenue to fund the eastern campaign? How do you see these pieces fitting together?\""

Juan is thinking through the logistics of colonial conquest in a realistic way. The player is right to distinguish between Granada (which can be integrated into an existing Christian kingdom with a large Christian population nearby) and isolated North African ports.\n\nLet me think through the historical models:\n1. Portuguese Ceuta (1415) - they held it as a military garrison, it was extremely expensive, relatively isolated\n2. Later Portuguese and Spanish North African presidios - fortified outposts, not integrated territories\n3. The Crusader States in the Levant - isolated Christian kingdoms requiring constant reinforcement\n4. Venetian and Genoese trading posts - commercial rather than territorial\n\nÁlvaro should provide a realistic assessment:\n- Large cities like Algiers would be nearly impossible to hold\n- Small ports as military garrisons are feasible but expensive\n- The model would be more like Crusader castles than territorial integration\n- Population management options are limited and mostly involve maintaining a fortress with a garrison\n- Without local Christian population or conversion success, these are expensive military outposts\n\nJuan is being smart here, thinking through the practical implications rather than just conquest for conquest's sake.\n\n\nÁlvaro's expression becomes more serious, appreciating the depth of your question. \"Ah. Yes. This is the fundamental problem Portugal discovered with Ceuta.\"\n\n\nHe settles back in his chair. \"In Granada, as you say, we conquered territory adjacent to Christian Castile. We can resettle Christian farmers, Christian merchants move in, the population can be integrated - converted or not - into an existing kingdom. Roads connect it to Toledo, Córdoba, Seville. It's not an island, it's an extension.\"\n\n\n\"North Africa is completely different. If we took Algiers - a city of what, 30,000 to 40,000 people? - we'd have a fortress surrounded by a Muslim population, with no Christian hinterland, supplied entirely by sea, with hostile territory in every direction.\" He shakes his head. \"Portugal holds Ceuta, but barely. They maintain a garrison of perhaps 2,500-3,000 troops permanently. Every ounce of food, every arrow, every replacement soldier arrives by ship. The city itself is essentially a military camp. Most of the original population fled when they conquered it.\"\n\n\n\"The Portuguese don't really rule Ceuta in the way we rule Toledo. They hold it. It's a fortress that happens to have a harbor. The surrounding territory is hostile. They can't expand beyond the walls without major military operations. It's strategically valuable, but it bleeds money constantly.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"Now imagine that same situation with Algiers - a much larger city, further from our shores, deeper in hostile territory. Even if we conquered it, how would we hold it? A garrison of 5,000 troops minimum? 8,000? The logistical tail would be enormous. And for what? We couldn't integrate the population, we couldn't expand the territory, we couldn't make it self-sustaining.\"\n\n\n\"The Crusader States in the Holy Land faced this exact problem,\" Álvaro continues. \"They held coastal fortresses and cities for two centuries, but they were always isolated Christian outposts in a Muslim sea. They survived only through constant reinforcement from Europe and because internal Muslim divisions prevented unified resistance. Even then, they eventually fell.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then offers a different perspective. \"Smaller targets make much more sense. A port like Melilla or a smaller fortress - perhaps 5,000-10,000 population or less. We take it, we fortify it heavily, we maintain a garrison of 500-1,000 troops. We're not trying to rule the population or expand territory. We're holding a strategic point - a naval base, a customs post, an anti-piracy station.\"\n\n\n\"The population would likely either flee or remain as a subjugated minority under military occupation. We'd bring in some Christian merchants and administrators, but primarily it's a military installation that happens to have a harbor and some civilian infrastructure. Like the fortresses the Military Orders hold on the frontier - they're not cities being governed, they're fortified positions being garrisoned.\"\n\n\n\"Portugal's model with Ceuta works precisely because Ceuta is relatively small and strategically positioned on the strait. They're not trying to rule Morocco from there. They're holding one fortress as a naval base and a statement of presence. That's replicable. Trying to conquer and hold major Muslim cities in the interior? That's...\" He trails off, shaking his head. \"That's a very different proposition. Extremely expensive, probably unsustainable, and unclear what we'd actually gain from it.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you carefully. \"So if we pursue North African operations, we should think in terms of fortified ports, not territorial conquest. Strategic points we can hold with modest garrisons, supplied by our fleet, serving specific purposes - trade control, piracy interdiction, naval bases. Not attempts to rule large Muslim populations far from Christian support.\"\n\n\n\"Does that distinction make sense? The difference between taking a fortress-port versus trying to conquer and hold a major city?\""

Let me think about the historical context:\n\n1. Morocco in 1432 was under the Marinid dynasty (Banu Marin), which had ruled since the mid-13th century\n2. By the 1430s, the Marinid sultanate was in decline - internal instability, loss of territory, weakening central authority\n3. The Marinids were NOT aligned with the Ottomans - in fact, the Ottomans were still primarily focused on Anatolia and the Balkans in the 1430s and hadn't yet expanded significantly into North Africa\n4. Morocco was relatively isolated from Ottoman influence at this time\n5. The Marinids had previously been involved in Iberian affairs, including supporting Granada\n6. By the 1430s, Morocco was fragmenting with various regional powers and tribes becoming more autonomous\n7. The Portuguese conquest of Ceuta in 1415 was a blow to Marinid prestige\n8. The Wattasid dynasty would eventually replace the Marinids later in the 15th century\n\nI should provide Álvaro with accurate historical information while making it clear that Morocco is NOT aligned with the Ottomans, and that the situation is actually quite fragmented, which could present opportunities for Castilian intervention.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods, clearly having studied this. \"Morocco is ruled by the Marinid dynasty - the Banu Marin - though 'ruled' may be too strong a word for their current state. They have a Sultan, yes, but the situation is... complicated.\"\n\n\nHe organizes his thoughts. \"The Marinids took power about two centuries ago and were quite strong for a time. They even intervened in Iberia repeatedly, supporting Granada against Christian kingdoms. But by now, they're in serious decline. The Sultan in Fez - I believe it's Abu Muhammad Abd al-Haqq, though I'd need to confirm - exercises limited control outside the major cities. Regional governors, tribal leaders, and local strongmen increasingly act independently.\"\n\n\n\"As for the Ottomans...\" Álvaro shakes his head definitively. \"No alignment whatsoever. The Ottomans are far to the east - Anatolia, the Balkans, threatening Constantinople. They have no presence in North Africa yet, and Morocco is completely outside their sphere of influence. If anything, the Marinids would be rivals to any Ottoman expansion, not allies. They're separate Muslim powers with no particular connection.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"In fact, Morocco's internal weakness is both opportunity and complication for us. On one hand, a fractured Morocco can't mount unified resistance to our operations. If we take a coastal fortress, the Sultan might not even be able to respond effectively. Local governors might even negotiate separately with us if it serves their interests.\"\n\n\n\"On the other hand, there's no single authority to make treaties with. Portugal discovered this with Ceuta - they conquered it, but they can't negotiate a comprehensive peace because the Sultan's authority doesn't extend reliably to the coast anymore. They face raids from tribal groups the Sultan doesn't control.\"\n\n\nHe pauses thoughtfully. \"Granada actually had closer ties to Morocco than Morocco has to the Ottomans. The Nasrids in Granada and the Marinids in Morocco both traced legitimacy to opposing the earlier Almohad dynasty. They've cooperated when convenient - Granada received Moroccan reinforcements during our campaign - but they're independent kingdoms with separate interests.\"\n\n\n\"The broader Muslim world is quite fragmented right now. The Ottomans in the east, the Mamluks controlling Egypt and the Levant, various dynasties across North Africa, and smaller states throughout. They're not unified under any single authority. This is actually advantageous for Christian powers - we face divided opponents rather than a coordinated Muslim response.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"So Morocco presents both opportunity and challenge. Weak enough that we could take coastal positions without facing overwhelming resistance, but fragmented enough that holding them means dealing with multiple local powers rather than one negotiating partner. Does that answer your question about the situation there?\""

Juan is asking about the feasibility of actual territorial conquest and long-term occupation in North Africa. Álvaro needs to give a realistic medieval assessment of this.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Historical reality - European powers did try this approach with mixed results\n2. The Crusader States model - it worked for a while but eventually failed\n3. Portugal's experience - they held Ceuta and eventually other coastal towns, but never really expanded inland\n4. Spain did eventually hold coastal North African presidios (fortified towns) for centuries, but these remained isolated garrison towns\n5. The population question - would they accept Christian rule?\n\nÁlvaro should be honest about both the possibilities and the enormous challenges. This isn't impossible - the Spanish did hold North African towns for centuries historically. But it's vastly more difficult than Granada for several reasons:\n\n1. Demographics - you'd be a tiny Christian minority ruling a large Muslim population with no nearby Christian population to draw from\n2. Supply lines - everything must come by sea\n3. Hostile hinterland - you can't expand safely, you're always under siege essentially\n4. Religious resistance - this isn't like Granada where there's historical Christian population and claims. This is clearly foreign conquest\n5. Climate and disease - North Africa is harsh for European troops\n6. Cost - enormous ongoing expense\n7. Limited benefit - what do you actually gain?\n\nBut Álvaro should also acknowledge:\n- It's not theoretically impossible\n- Smaller strongholds could work (like historical Spanish presidios)\n- Military Orders could be useful\n- With enough resources and commitment, you could hold positions\n- The question is whether it's worth the cost\n\nThe key insight Álvaro should provide: you could probably hold fortified coastal towns (like Portugal did with Ceuta, Tangier, etc.), but actual territorial expansion inland would be extremely difficult and probably unsustainable. The population would NOT easily accept Christian rule - there's no historical precedent for that succeeding in North Africa.\n\nThis is a good opportunity for Álvaro to be frank about the difference between what's militarily possible in the short term versus what's sustainable long-term.\n\n\nÁlvaro takes a long breath, clearly weighing his words carefully. He wants to be honest with you, not simply dismissive.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, let me think through this seriously, because you're asking the right questions.\" He stands and begins pacing slowly. \"Could we take major cities and ports? Yes, militarily we could. Our army is excellent, their coastal defenses are weaker than Granada's, and we have naval supremacy. Algiers, Oran, Tangier, even multiple cities - we could conquer them within a year or two if we committed the resources.\"\n\n\n\"Could we build forts and establish Military Orders to hold them? Also yes. The Orders would actually be ideal for this - warrior-monks holding fortified positions in hostile territory is precisely what they were created for. The Templars and Hospitallers did exactly this in the Holy Land for two centuries.\"\n\n\nHe turns to face you. \"But would the population eventually accept Christian rule? This is where I must be very honest with you, Your Majesty. The historical evidence suggests... no. Not in the way you're hoping.\"\n\n\nHe returns to his seat, leaning forward intently. \"Consider the Crusader States in the Holy Land. They held Jerusalem, Acre, Antioch, and other cities for nearly two hundred years. They built magnificent fortresses, established Military Orders, brought in Christian settlers, created entire administrative systems. And the local Muslim and even Christian Orthodox populations never truly accepted Frankish rule. They tolerated it when they had no choice, rebelled when they saw opportunity, and ultimately the Crusader States fell because they remained foreign occupiers in a hostile land.\"\n\n\n\"The problem isn't military capability - it's mathematics and geography. Let's use Algiers as an example since you mentioned it. Say we conquer it - perhaps 35,000 population, mostly Muslim. To hold it securely, we'd need what... 5,000 troops minimum? Maybe 8,000 to be truly safe? That's roughly one Christian soldier for every four to seven Muslim civilians.\"\n\n\nHe counts off on his fingers. \"Those 35,000 Muslims have families in the interior, trade connections throughout North Africa, religious ties to the broader Muslim world, and nowhere else to go - it's their homeland. We'd need to supply 8,000 troops entirely by sea, every week, forever. Food, weapons, replacements, everything. One bad storm season and the garrison starves. One major uprising and we'd need to send an entire relief army from Castile.\"\n\n\n\"In Granada, we conquered a Muslim kingdom, yes, but Granada was geographically part of Iberia, surrounded by Christian kingdoms, with historical precedent of Christian rule, and connected by roads to our other territories. A Muslim in Granada can look around and see they're now part of a much larger Christian realm. They can trade with Córdoba, travel to Seville, see Christian power is permanent and overwhelming.\"\n\n\n\"A Muslim in occupied Algiers looks around and sees: Christian fortress on the coast, hostile Muslim countryside in every direction, their Sultan in Fez still independent, trade routes still controlled by Muslims, and a Christian garrison that's isolated and vulnerable. They wouldn't see Christian rule as inevitable or permanent - they'd see it as a temporary occupation to be resisted.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's voice becomes more emphatic. \"And here's the critical difference: Granada had perhaps 300,000 Muslims in a larger Castilian kingdom of several million Christians. We can absorb that population, integrate them over time, overwhelm them demographically. But if we take major North African cities, we're talking about ruling hundreds of thousands of Muslims with only garrison troops, separated from Christian Castile by the sea, with no Christian hinterland to draw from. The mathematics simply don't work for integration or acceptance.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then softens slightly. \"However - and this is important - smaller strongholds absolutely could work. Portugal proves this with Ceuta. It's not a beloved part of Portuguese kingdom where Muslims contentedly accept Christian rule. It's a fortified military base that happens to have some civilian population. Most of the original population fled or was expelled. Portugal brings in Christian settlers and merchants, maintains a large garrison, and holds it as a strategic position, not as integrated territory.\"\n\n\n\"We could replicate that model. Take smaller ports - places with 5,000-10,000 population rather than 35,000. Fortify them heavily. Garrison them with 1,000-1,500 troops. Let most of the Muslim population flee if they want. Bring in Christian settlers - perhaps retired soldiers, merchants seeking opportunity, second sons with no inheritance. Establish Military Order chapters to provide permanent military presence. Use them as naval bases and trade posts, not as attempts to rule Muslim populations.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"That's sustainable. That's what the Spanish Military Orders were created for - holding fortified positions on hostile frontiers. But trying to occupy and integrate major Muslim cities in the heart of North Africa? Your Majesty, I fear that's beyond even your considerable capabilities. The Crusader States tried for two hundred years with far more resources from all of Christendom, and they ultimately failed. Not because of military defeat in any single battle, but because the fundamental situation was unsustainable.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro spreads his hands. \"So my counsel is: yes to fortified ports and strategic strongholds, similar to Portugal's approach. Establish them, garrison them with Military Orders, use them to control trade and suppress piracy. But no to attempting territorial conquest and population integration on the North African mainland. The costs would be enormous, the benefits unclear, and history suggests it wouldn't succeed in the long term.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Unless you're prepared to commit to something even larger - not just taking cities, but actual conquest on the scale of Granada. Tens of thousands of troops permanently, massive settlement programs, generations of effort. That might work eventually, but it would consume resources you need for Constantinople and absorb your entire reign. Is that the crusade you want to fight?\"\n\n\nWhat's your response to this frank assessment?"

Juan is thinking creatively about indirect approaches rather than direct conquest. Let me think through what Álvaro would know and how he'd respond.\n\n1. The Marinid Sultan's control over coastal cities - historically, by the 1430s the Marinids were indeed quite weak and fractured. Coastal cities often had significant autonomy or were controlled by local governors/strongmen who might act independently.\n\n2. Supporting rebellions - this is classic divide-and-conquer strategy. Álvaro would recognize the merit but also the complications.\n\n3. Using converted Muslims as intermediaries - this is very creative and actually has some historical precedent in various forms. Martín de Alcalá (formerly Yusuf ibn Rashid) and his men would be potential candidates.\n\n4. Allying with rival Muslim factions - this was common in medieval politics. Christian kingdoms allied with some Muslim kingdoms against others all the time during the Reconquista.\n\nÁlvaro would be intrigued by this approach because it's much more sophisticated than direct conquest. It shows Juan thinking like a mature strategist rather than just a crusader. However, there are complications:\n\n- Religious issues: allying with Muslims against other Muslims is politically and theologically complex given the crusade context\n- The converts might not be trusted by other Muslims given their conversion\n- Finding reliable allies in a fragmented situation is difficult\n- This approach takes longer and is less direct than military conquest\n\nLet me have Álvaro respond thoughtfully to each possibility, recognizing the strategic sophistication while pointing out complications.\n\n\nÁlvaro's eyebrows rise with evident interest. \"Now that's strategic thinking, Your Majesty.\" He leans forward, clearly engaged by this more sophisticated approach.\n\n\n\"The Sultan's hold on coastal cities is indeed weak and fragmenting. From what our intelligence suggests, many coastal governors operate with significant autonomy. The Sultan in Fez collects nominal tribute when he can enforce it, but day-to-day governance is local. Some of these governors are effectively independent rulers who acknowledge the Sultan only when convenient.\"\n\n\nHe begins working through your suggestions methodically. \"Supporting a rebellion or allying with a rival faction - this has real potential. During the Reconquista, Christian kingdoms allied with some Muslim states against others constantly. Your grandfather allied with the Sultan of Granada against Aragon. These arrangements are pragmatically effective even if theologically awkward.\"\n\n\n\"If we could identify a coastal governor or regional strongman who's already in conflict with Fez, we could offer support - money, weapons, even military assistance - in exchange for commercial treaties, anti-piracy cooperation, perhaps eventually Christian settlement rights in certain areas. We'd be positioning ourselves as a useful ally rather than a conquering threat. Much less expensive than direct conquest, and it gives us influence without garrison costs.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, considering complications. \"The challenge is finding reliable partners and managing the religious optics. You've built your reputation on crusading against Muslims. Now we'd be allying with some Muslims against others? It's not unprecedented - it's actually quite common - but it requires careful presentation. We'd emphasize that we're supporting local order against chaos, protecting trade routes, working with 'reasonable' Muslim authorities who respect Christian commerce. The Church permits such arrangements when framed properly.\"\n\n\nThen he addresses your more creative suggestion, and his expression shows he's genuinely impressed. \"Using converted Muslims as intermediaries... Your Majesty, that's remarkably sophisticated. Commander Martín and his men - they're Castilian subjects now, baptized Christians, but they know the language, culture, and have family connections across the strait. They could absolutely serve as envoys, translators, intelligence gatherers.\"\n\n\n\"We could even grant them estates on the Moroccan coast if we secure territory. Imagine: Martín and his converted officers hold fortified positions, they communicate with local populations in Arabic, they understand Muslim customs and concerns, but they're sworn to you and to Christ. They'd be far more effective at managing Muslim populations than purely Castilian governors who know nothing of the culture.\"\n\n\nHe works through the implications. \"This solves several problems. First, it gives these converted Muslims a clear place and purpose - they're not just former enemies who switched sides, they're valuable specialists bridging two worlds. Second, it makes governance more practical - they can explain Christian rule in terms Muslims understand, negotiate with local leaders, identify who's trustworthy. Third, it might actually encourage more conversions if Muslims see that converts can gain significant positions and land.\"\n\n\nBut then he raises complications. \"However, there are risks. Would other Muslims trust them? They converted, after all - they're seen as apostates by many. That could make them less effective as intermediaries rather than more. And there's a theological question: are we creating a class of Christian lords ruling Muslim subjects using Muslim cultural practices? The Church might have concerns about that blurring the distinction between Christian and Muslim identity.\"\n\n\nHe shifts to the alliance question more directly. \"As for allying with a larger Muslim power - say a rival to the Marinid Sultan - this could work but requires identifying who. The various North African dynasties and tribal confederations have complex relationships. We'd need good intelligence to know who's strong enough to be useful but weak enough to need our help, who's reliable, who wouldn't turn on us once they've achieved their goals.\"\n\n\n\"The Mamluks in Egypt are the strongest Muslim power in the region, but they're far away and probably too powerful to need us. Various tribal confederations and regional strongmen in Morocco and Algeria might be better targets - they need resources and legitimacy, we could provide both in exchange for concrete concessions.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro leans back, synthesizing. \"So here's what I'd recommend: we send intelligence missions to the Moroccan coast. Not military expeditions - diplomatic feelers, merchant contacts, information gathering. We identify which coastal governors or tribal leaders are in conflict with Fez or with each other. We assess who might be open to arrangements with us.\"\n\n\n\"Simultaneously, we could send Commander Martín on a reconnaissance mission - he speaks Arabic, he knows the culture, and he can gauge whether converted Muslims would be trusted enough to serve as intermediaries or if they'd be seen as traitors. If the latter, we need a different approach.\"\n\n\n\"If we find promising contacts, we start with trade agreements and anti-piracy cooperation. Nothing that requires crusade-level commitment. We build relationships, demonstrate we're reliable partners, and position ourselves as a power that can be worked with rather than just feared. Over time, that influence could translate into commercial access, perhaps coastal bases with local consent rather than through conquest, maybe even Christian settlement in certain areas if local rulers see benefit in it.\"\n\n\n\"This approach takes longer than military conquest,\" he acknowledges, \"but it's far less expensive, more sustainable, and builds influence rather than generating resistance. And it leaves military options open - if diplomacy produces useful allies, excellent. If not, we haven't committed resources we can't recover.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"The key advantage is that this doesn't conflict with your other priorities. Diplomatic missions and intelligence gathering cost relatively little. They can proceed while you're planning Constantinople, attending Basel, managing the kingdom. Whereas direct military conquest of North African cities would consume years of your attention and enormous resources.\"\n\n\n\"Does this indirect approach appeal to you? Or do you still prefer more direct military action?\""

He'd probably be impressed but cautious.\n\nLet me have Álvaro think through this carefully, acknowledging the cleverness while raising the real complications.\n\n\nÁlvaro goes very still, his eyes distant as he works through the implications of what you're proposing. After a long moment, he speaks slowly, clearly thinking aloud.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty... this is genuinely brilliant in conception. I need to think through whether it's feasible in execution.\"\n\n\nHe stands and moves to the window, organizing his thoughts. \"The core insight is absolutely correct: the problem isn't taking cities, it's holding them. And your solution - create a class of converted Muslim Christians who gain titles and lands in exchange for conversion and loyalty - that solves multiple problems simultaneously.\"\n\n\nHe turns back, counting off on his fingers. \"First, it creates genuine incentive for conversion beyond threat or coercion. A Muslim commander or merchant who converts gains not just spiritual salvation but material advancement - estates, titles, authority. Second, these converted lords understand the local population, speak the language, know the culture. They can govern Muslim subjects far more effectively than Castilian nobles who know nothing of North Africa. Third, it's self-sustaining - success breeds more conversions as ambitious Muslims see the path to advancement.\"\n\n\n\"And fourth,\" he adds with growing enthusiasm, \"it positions us as liberators rather than conquerors. We're not taking Muslim lands for Castile - we're helping local converts establish Christian rule over their own territories. That's theologically cleaner and politically more palatable to everyone involved.\"\n\n\nBut then his expression becomes more serious. \"However, there are profound complications we must think through carefully.\"\n\n\nHe returns to his seat, leaning forward intently. \"First: the genuineness of conversions. Commander Martín's conversion appears sincere - he experienced a profound spiritual crisis after Alcalá. But if we create a system where conversion equals land and titles, we'll attract opportunistic conversions. Muslims who mouth Christian prayers while privately remaining Muslim, who see baptism as a price to pay for advancement rather than genuine acceptance of Christ.\"\n\n\n\"The Church calls these 'conversos' when they're Jews who convert, and there's constant suspicion about whether conversions are genuine. Now we'd be creating the same dynamic with Muslims. How do we distinguish sincere converts from those simply seeking advantage? And does it matter, if they're publicly Christian and raise their children in the faith? The Inquisition was created precisely because of these questions with Jewish conversos.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then continues. \"Second: will Muslim populations accept converted rulers? Commander Martín and his men are seen as apostates by traditional Muslims - they've abandoned Islam. That makes them worse than Christians in many Muslims' eyes. A Muslim city might prefer direct Christian rule to being governed by those they consider traitors to their faith. We can't assume converted Muslims automatically gain trust from Muslim populations - they might face more resistance, not less.\"\n\n\n\"Third: what about Castilian nobles? If we're granting North African estates and titles to converted Muslims while Castilian nobles who've served loyally for generations get nothing... that creates resentment. Why should a Muslim who converted last year receive lands in Morocco while a Christian noble who fought throughout the Granada campaign receives only modest rewards? The nobility will see this as favoring converts over the faithful, and that's politically dangerous.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's tone becomes more cautious. \"Fourth, and perhaps most importantly: Rome's reaction. Pope Eugenius and the Church hierarchy will ask profound questions. Are we creating genuine Christians, or are we creating a class of people who are Christian in name only? If conversion is motivated primarily by material gain rather than spiritual conviction, is it valid? And if these converted Christian lords rule Muslim populations using Muslim customs and practices - speaking Arabic, following local traditions, perhaps even allowing their Muslim subjects to continue practicing Islam - are they really establishing Christian rule, or just creating Muslim governance with Christian labels?\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes seriously. \"There's a theological concept called 'scandal' - something that appears to corrupt the faith even if technically permissible. Mass conversions motivated by land grants, Christian lords governing Muslim subjects using Muslim cultural practices, communities that are Christian in name but Muslim in culture... the Church might see this as scandal. It could undermine the crusade's spiritual legitimacy even while achieving strategic objectives.\"\n\n\nBut then he softens slightly. \"However, there are counterarguments. The Church has always accepted that some conversions are motivated by practical considerations - that's not new. What matters is that converts are baptized, acknowledge Christ, and raise their children in the faith. Over generations, even opportunistic conversions become genuine Christianity as children know only Christian practice.\"\n\n\n\"And using converted Muslims as intermediaries isn't creating 'Muslim Christians' - it's recognizing that effective governance requires cultural knowledge. A Christian Spanish noble trying to govern Algiers through translators would be helpless. A converted Muslim who knows the culture, speaks the language, and understands local concerns but who genuinely serves Christ and Rome - that's just practical wisdom.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro leans back, synthesizing. \"So here's what I think could work, with careful implementation: We start exactly as you suggest - form a delegation of our most trusted converts. Commander Martín certainly, probably Fernando the former qadi since he's intellectually impressive, perhaps a few others who've proven themselves. We send them to Morocco not as conquerors but as envoys, feeling out which coastal governors or tribal leaders might be open to cooperation.\"\n\n\n\"If we find allies - Muslim leaders in conflict with Fez or with each other - we offer support. We help them militarily if needed, but the key is: we help them take and hold territory, we don't take it ourselves. Then, after they've secured power with our help, we negotiate: Christian merchant quarters, trade privileges, protection for Christian travelers, perhaps small churches or chapels.\"\n\n\n\"And here's the crucial part: we offer the convert path, but we don't make it cheap. Conversion must involve genuine theological instruction - months of study with Fray Hernando or other clergy. Public baptism with witnesses. Sworn oaths before sacred relics. Service in the crusader forces to prove commitment. We make conversion difficult enough that only those willing to truly commit will pursue it.\"\n\n\n\"Those who prove themselves - who convert sincerely, who serve faithfully, who demonstrate genuine Christianity over time - those are the ones we grant estates and titles to. Not immediate rewards for baptism, but earned advancement through proven loyalty and faith. That addresses the opportunistic conversion problem while still creating the incentive structure.\"\n\n\n\"For the estates themselves, we could establish something like the Military Orders but specifically for converts: the 'Order of Saint James of Morocco' or similar. Converted Muslims who've proven themselves join this order, take monastic vows alongside military service, and hold estates as warrior-monks rather than independent lords. That gives them authority and land while maintaining clear Christian structure and oversight.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"This approach would be gradual - probably taking decades to truly bear fruit - but it could work. We're not creating instant Christian kingdoms in North Africa. We're building influence through local allies, encouraging genuine conversions through earned rewards, and slowly establishing Christian presence through proven converts who govern under clear Church authority.\"\n\n\n\"The risks remain: opportunistic conversions, suspicion from both Muslims and Christians, theological questions about sincerity. But if we implement this carefully, with proper safeguards, it could achieve what direct conquest cannot - sustainable Christian influence in North Africa without the enormous costs of occupation.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you intently. \"Does this refined approach match your vision? And are you prepared for this to be a generational project rather than an immediate campaign? Because creating a self-sustaining stream of genuine conversions and establishing stable Christian governance through converts - that takes time, careful management, and patience.\""

      "say": "Thought process: Validated historical argument, reconciled anachronism, maintained character consistency.\n\nThis is a really interesting approach from the player - he's drawing on historical examples of how Christianity absorbed and adapted to different cultures (like Germanic paganism becoming integrated into Christian practice), and arguing that Muslim cultural elements could similarly be integrated into Christianity over time. This is actually quite historically sophisticated.\n\nThen he asks about the Inquisition, which hasn't been established yet in 1432. The Spanish Inquisition wasn't founded until 1478, though there were earlier forms of inquisition. Álvaro would know about the Medieval Inquisition established in the 12th-13th centuries to combat heresies like Catharism, but not the Spanish Inquisition specifically.\n\nI should:\n1. Acknowledge Juan's point about cultural adaptation of Christianity (legitimate historical point)\n2. Explain what Álvaro knows about inquisitorial practices as they exist in 1432\n3. Connect this to the converso question that's emerging\n4. Return to the practical plans for the Muslim convert commune/delegation\n\nLet me be careful not to break character or introduce anachronistic knowledge.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods slowly, clearly impressed by your theological perspective. \"You're absolutely right, Your Majesty. Christianity has always adapted to local cultures while maintaining its essential truths. The Church in Constantinople looks quite different from the Church in Rome, German Christians from Spanish Christians, yet all acknowledge Christ and the authority of the faith.\"\n\n\n\"If these conversions take root over generations, North African Christianity would develop its own character - perhaps Arabic liturgy eventually, local saints, practices that reflect their culture. As long as the core remains - acknowledgment of Christ, submission to Rome, the sacraments - the Church has always allowed considerable variation. Your vision of this is... mature. Not expecting instant transformation into Castilian Christians, but genuine conversion that develops its own authentic expression over time.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then addresses your question about the Inquisition. \"Ah. The Inquisition is a Church institution established about two centuries ago to investigate and combat heresy. The Pope grants certain clergy - usually Dominicans - special authority to examine those accused of heretical beliefs, determine if they've truly strayed from orthodoxy, and impose penalties ranging from penance to execution in severe cases.\"\n\n\n\"It was created primarily to address the Cathar heresy in southern France, which the Church saw as a profound threat. The Inquisitors have formal procedures: investigation, testimony, examination of the accused, and judgment. They work with secular authorities - the Church identifies heretics, civil authorities carry out punishments.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's expression becomes more somber. \"The Inquisition has been... controversial. Some see it as necessary protection of the faith against dangerous heresy. Others see excessive zeal, false accusations, coerced confessions. The procedures can be harsh - torture is sometimes used to extract truth, though it's supposed to be carefully limited.\"\n\n\n\"I mentioned it because in Castile and Aragon, there's growing concern about conversos - Jews who've converted to Christianity, often under pressure. Many Christians suspect these conversions aren't genuine, that conversos secretly practice Judaism while publicly claiming Christianity. There's talk of establishing an Inquisition specifically to investigate conversos, to determine who's truly Christian and who's merely pretending.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes carefully. \"If we create a system encouraging Muslim conversions through material incentives - land and titles - we'll face similar suspicions. Are they genuine Christians or secret Muslims? This is why I emphasized making conversion difficult and earned. If the Church establishes an Inquisition to investigate Muslim converts the way they investigate Jewish conversos, we need these conversions to withstand scrutiny.\"\n\n\n\"The Inquisition asks questions like: Do you attend Mass regularly? Can you recite the Creed? Do you observe Christian fasts and holy days? Do you avoid Muslim practices? Do your neighbors witness Christian behavior? For conversos, they look for signs of secret Jewish practice - special Sabbath meals, avoiding pork, circumcising sons. For Muslim converts, they'd look for secret mosque attendance, continued observance of Ramadan, refusal to drink wine.\"\n\n\n\"Commander Martín would pass any such examination easily - he's demonstrated genuine faith through years of service. But if we create hundreds or thousands of conversions motivated primarily by land grants, many wouldn't withstand scrutiny. And that could bring the entire enterprise into disrepute.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro leans forward. \"This is why the commune approach is wise. We start with a small group of proven converts - Martín, Fernando, perhaps twenty or thirty others who've demonstrated genuine Christianity through extended service and examination. They form the core. They travel to Morocco as a delegation representing Christian converts, not as Castilian conquerors.\"\n\n\n\"They identify potential allies - governors or tribal leaders who might cooperate. They explain the opportunities: Christian converts can gain land and titles, cities can gain Christian trade and protection, alliances can be formed against mutual enemies. But they also explain the requirements: genuine theological instruction, baptism, service, proof of faith. Not instant rewards, but a path to advancement for those willing to commit.\"\n\n\n\"This delegation would need careful preparation. We should probably send Fray Hernando or another theologian with them to provide spiritual authority and conduct examinations. We'd need translators, gifts for potential allies, letters of introduction. And we'd need clear instructions on what arrangements they're authorized to negotiate.\"\n\n\nHe pauses thoughtfully. \"We should also consider: which converts should lead this delegation? Martín is the obvious choice - he commanded Alcalá, he's proven himself repeatedly, men respect him. Fernando provides intellectual credibility - a former qadi who converted after genuine theological crisis. Who else from among our converts has the combination of capability, proven faith, and cultural knowledge to serve as effective envoys?\"\n\n\n\"And we need to decide: do we send them immediately, or wait until after the Te Deum in April? There are advantages to both. Immediate departure shows urgency and gets intelligence flowing quickly. But waiting until after the ceremony means they can attend, demonstrate the success of Granada conversions to all the assembled Christian monarchs, and perhaps recruit additional support for North African ventures.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you expectantly. \"What's your thinking on timeline and composition of this delegation? And should we brief Commander Martín on this vision before we formally commission him, to ensure he's willing and capable of taking on such a role?\""

Send a letter to Mendoza about meeting the Council of Great Houses\n3. Address the two major nobles who received ultimatums from Crown Marshals\n\nLet me check the project files for details on the tax enforcement situation.\n\nFrom Chapter 40, I see:\n- Duke of Arévalo and Duke of Medina Sidonia received two-month ultimatums\n- They owe significant amounts\n- Crown Marshals were deployed with enforcement authority\n- This was part of the tax reform enforcement strategy\n\nThe two nobles are:\n1. Duke of Arévalo - owes substantial back taxes\n2. Duke of Medina Sidonia - owes substantial back taxes\n\nBoth received formal summons: pay the taxes owed + appear before Juan to explain the delay, OR be declared in rebellion.\n\nNow I need to create a d100 table evaluating likely responses. Let me think about success/failure factors:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (reasons they might comply):\n1. Juan just conquered Granada - demonstrated military capability is overwhelming\n2. Crown Marshal system shows serious enforcement intent\n3. Recent examples of rebels being crushed (the Mad Count)\n4. Council of Great Houses creating peer pressure\n5. Other nobles watching - resistance could isolate them\n6. Mendoza family collected MORE than owed, setting example\n7. Juan's reputation for following through on threats\n8. Tax amounts are significant but not ruinous\n9. Alternative (rebellion) has terrible odds given Juan's army\n10. Papal backing makes resistance look like defying Church authority\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (reasons they might resist):\n1. Pride - major nobles submitting to ultimatums is humiliating\n2. Financial strain - genuinely struggling to pay (though unlikely for these magnates)\n3. Testing Juan's resolve - is he willing to actually march on them?\n4. Hoping others will join them in resistance\n5. Seeing this as overreach of royal authority\n6. Personal grudges or faction alignments\n7. Believing Juan is too occupied with other matters to enforce\n8. Regional power base makes them feel secure\n9. Historical precedent of nobles avoiding taxes without consequence\n10. Fear that compliance sets precedent for future extractions\n\nGiven Juan's recent overwhelming success, the cultural context of medieval hierarchy, and the clear examples made of resisters, compliance should be the most likely outcome. But there should be meaningful chance of resistance since these are proud magnates being given ultimatums.\n\nLet me create a realistic d100 table:\n\n1-40: Full compliance (40%)\n41-70: Grudging compliance with conditions (30%)\n71-85: Partial compliance, negotiation attempt (15%)\n86-95: Defiance but no open rebellion (9%)\n96-100: Open defiance/rebellion (6%)\n\nThis reflects that compliance is most likely but not guaranteed, with various degrees of resistance possible.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"Understood, Your Majesty. Commander Yahya will have his audience in Granada, and you'll clarify matters personally.\"\n\n\nHe makes another note. \"I'll send word to Don Íñigo immediately requesting a meeting with the Council of Great Houses at your convenience. They've been meeting regularly - apparently they've already conducted internal audits on three member families and collected an additional 15,000 maravedís in underpayments. Don Íñigo will be pleased to present their progress.\"\n\n\nThen his expression becomes more serious. \"The two dukes - yes. The Crown Marshals delivered your ultimatums six weeks ago. Two months to either pay what they owe and appear before you to explain the delay, or be declared in rebellion. We should be receiving their responses any day now.\"\n\n\nHe pulls out his notes. \"Duke of Arévalo owes approximately 45,000 maravedís in back taxes over three years. Duke of Medina Sidonia owes approximately 38,000 maravedís. Both are substantial amounts, but not ruinous for estates of their size. The ultimatum was clear: pay in full, appear in person, or face the consequences.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro looks up. \"Before we hear their responses, let me assess the factors that will influence their decisions.\"\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (Reasons for Compliance):\n\n\nOverwhelming demonstration of power: You just conquered Granada in 18 months. Your military capability is undeniable.\n\nCrown Marshal enforcement system: Shows this isn't empty threat - you've created permanent institutional capacity for enforcement.\n\nRecent examples: The \"Mad Count\" rebellion was crushed. Every noble in Castile knows resistance ends badly.\n\nPeer pressure: Council of Great Houses shows other nobles complying - even Mendoza collected MORE than owed. Resistance would isolate them.\n\nYour reputation: You follow through on threats. The Infantes, the rebels, Granada - you don't bluff.\n\nManageable amounts: 38,000-45,000 maravedís is significant but not impossible for major ducal estates. They CAN pay.\n\nPapal backing: Resistance looks like defying Church authority since taxes were authorized under crusade bull.\n\nPolitical calculation: Rebellion has terrible odds. Your army is battle-hardened, experienced, and victorious.\n\nAlternative paths: You offered to meet them, hear explanations. There's a non-humiliating way to comply.\n\nTime to consider: Six weeks to think it over. Initial anger has time to cool into pragmatism.\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (Reasons for Resistance):\n\n\nPride: Major nobles submitting to royal ultimatums is deeply humiliating. Sets precedent they're subject to crown authority.\n\nTesting resolve: Are you actually willing to march an army against them? Or is this theater?\n\nHope for solidarity: Maybe other nobles will join resistance, creating coalition you can't easily crush.\n\nRegional power: Both have strong regional bases. Duke of Medina Sidonia controls significant southern territory.\n\nPrecedent concerns: If they pay under threat, what's next? More taxes? More demands? Where does it end?\n\nPersonal factors: Possible grudges, faction alignments, or believing they're being singled out unfairly.\n\nDistraction theory: You're planning Basel, Rome, Mediterranean commerce, North Africa. Maybe too busy to enforce?\n\nHistorical patterns: Nobles have avoided taxes for generations. Why should this time be different?\n\nFace-saving: Appearing before you to \"explain delay\" is humiliating. They'd rather fight than grovel.\n\nUnderestimating you: Perhaps they think an 20-year-old king won't really follow through despite evidence.\n\n\nÁlvaro finishes his assessment. \"On balance, compliance is most likely. Your position is overwhelmingly strong, and the costs of resistance are clear. But these are proud men, and pride makes people do foolish things. There's meaningful chance of resistance, either from miscalculation or simple refusal to bend.\"\n\n\n\"Let me propose possible response categories for when we hear from them:\"\n\n\nD100 TABLE: DUCAL RESPONSES TO TAX ULTIMATUM\n\n\n1-40: FULL COMPLIANCE (40%)\n\n\nPay all back taxes in full\n\nAppear in Toledo to personally explain delays\n\nAcknowledge crown authority\n\nPossibly bring additional \"gift\" to demonstrate loyalty\n\nAccept outcome: They recognize overwhelming strength of position\n\n\n41-70: GRUDGING COMPLIANCE WITH CONDITIONS (30%)\n\n\nPay most or all of back taxes\n\nRequest private audience rather than public appearance\n\nAsk for payment timeline (installments) rather than lump sum\n\nInclude letter explaining \"misunderstandings\" or \"administrative errors\"\n\nComply but try to preserve dignity and negotiate terms\n\nAccept outcome: They comply but try to minimize humiliation\n\n\n71-85: PARTIAL COMPLIANCE, NEGOTIATION ATTEMPT (15%)\n\n\nPay portion of back taxes (50-75%)\n\nOffer to discuss remaining amount\n\nCite financial difficulties, propose timeline\n\nRequest you visit them rather than them traveling to Toledo\n\nArgue about assessment accuracy\n\nTesting boundaries: Will you accept partial compliance?\n\n\n86-95: DEFIANCE WITHOUT OPEN REBELLION (9%)\n\n\nRefuse to pay or appear\n\nSend letter disputing crown's authority to make such demands\n\nClaim taxes were already paid or don't apply to them\n\nDon't raise armies but don't submit\n\nWait to see if you'll actually enforce\n\nSerious challenge: Requires forceful response but not yet military action\n\n\n96-100: OPEN DEFIANCE/REBELLION (6%)\n\n\nRefuse all demands\n\nRaise troops defensively\n\nSend letters to other nobles seeking support\n\nPossibly coordinate between the two dukes\n\nDirect challenge to royal authority\n\nRequires military response\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down his notes. \"We should hear from them within days, perhaps a week at most.

This means:\n- Pay most or all of back taxes\n- Request private audience rather than public appearance\n- Ask for payment timeline (installments) rather than lump sum\n- Include letter explaining \"misunderstandings\" or \"administrative errors\"\n- Comply but try to preserve dignity and negotiate terms\n- Accept outcome: They comply but try to minimize humiliation\n\nSo the dukes will comply, but they'll be trying to save face and negotiate terms. This is a good outcome for Juan - they're submitting, but in a way that allows them to preserve some dignity. I should have Álvaro explain what this means going forward and then address the fleet question.\n\nNow for the fleet question - I need to consult project files to understand the current situation with Castile's naval capabilities.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods, noting something on his parchment. \"So the dukes respond within the week... I'll inform you immediately when their messages arrive.\" He sets that document aside with a small satisfied expression - clearly whatever response comes will be interesting.\n\n\nThen he shifts to your fleet question, his expression becoming more animated. \"Ah, naval power. This is actually quite important given your Mediterranean commerce ambitions and potential North African operations.\"\n\n\nHe organizes his thoughts. \"Currently, Castile has almost no permanent royal fleet. We have a handful of royal galleys - perhaps 5-6 vessels - used primarily for coastal patrol and communication. Nothing compared to Venice's hundreds of war galleys or Genoa's merchant fleet. We've relied entirely on contracting foreign vessels when needed.\"\n\n\n\"For the Granada campaign, we contracted Genoese galleys - initially 8 Portuguese galleys for one year from your father-in-law, then additional Genoese vessels as needed. Those contracts are still active for a few more months, but they're expensive. We're paying for ships, crews, captains, everything. And when contracts end, the ships leave.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"Building our own fleet makes enormous strategic sense for several reasons. First, Mediterranean commerce requires protecting our merchant ships from pirates - either through convoy escorts or patrol vessels that suppress piracy at its source. We can't rely on contracted foreign ships for this indefinitely.\"\n\n\n\"Second, any North African operations - whether conquest, supporting allies, or establishing trading posts - requires naval transport and supply. Again, contracting ships works short-term but is expensive and unreliable long-term.\"\n\n\n\"Third, controlling both sides of the Gibraltar strait only works if we can actually patrol those waters. That requires permanent naval presence, not ships we rent occasionally.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth,\" he adds with a slight smile, \"if you're serious about Constantinople, you'll need a fleet capable of transporting thousands of troops across the Mediterranean and maintaining supply lines through hostile waters. That's impossible with contracted vessels - you need ships you control completely.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro pulls out some notes. \"The advantages of building our own fleet: Complete control over deployment and strategy. No contract negotiations or foreign captains refusing orders. Long-term cost savings - expensive initially but cheaper over decades. Permanent capability rather than temporary rental. And pride - major powers have their own fleets.\"\n\n\n\"The challenges: Enormous upfront costs. A single war galley costs perhaps 8,000-10,000 florins to build, fully outfit, and crew for a year. A fleet of 20 galleys would be 160,000-200,000 florins initially, plus ongoing maintenance and crew costs of perhaps 80,000-100,000 florins annually. That's comparable to fielding a major army.\"\n\n\n\"Second challenge: expertise. Building ships requires shipyards, skilled carpenters, sailmakers, rope-makers, all the infrastructure. We'd need to either develop that capability or contract Italian or Basque shipbuilders to establish it for us. Málaga has shipbuilding facilities from Granada, but they're oriented toward Muslim designs. We'd need to adapt or rebuild.\"\n\n\n\"Third: crews. Galley crews require hundreds of rowers, sailors, marines per ship. Finding, training, and maintaining those crews is ongoing effort. The Venetians use a mix of free rowers paid wages and criminal convicts. Genoa uses primarily free labor. We'd need to decide our approach.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth: command structure. We'd need admirals, captains, naval officers who understand maritime warfare. Don Fadrique has commanded our naval operations during the Granada campaign competently, but that was coordinating contracted vessels. Building and leading a permanent fleet is different expertise.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then offers his assessment. \"Given your ambitions - Mediterranean commerce, North African operations, potentially Constantinople - building a fleet isn't optional, it's necessary. The questions are scale and timeline.\"\n\n\n\"My recommendation: Start modestly but with clear growth path. Begin with perhaps 10-12 war galleys built over 2-3 years. Use Málaga's existing facilities, contract Genoese shipwrights to oversee construction and train our workers. Initial cost perhaps 80,000-100,000 florins spread over 2-3 years, plus 40,000-50,000 florins annual operating costs once built.\"\n\n\n\"That gives us core capability for Mediterranean patrol and commerce protection. Then, if Constantinople becomes reality, we expand dramatically - perhaps to 40-50 vessels total, building 10-15 per year for several years. That would cost hundreds of thousands of florins but would create a fleet capable of major operations.\"\n\n\n\"The beauty of starting now is that by the time you're ready for Constantinople - say 1435 or 1436 - you'd have foundational fleet already operating, infrastructure in place, crews trained, and clear path to rapid expansion.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"So my counsel: Yes, begin fleet construction immediately. Make it part of the Mediterranean commerce development - the two initiatives support each other. Start modest, plan for expansion, and position Castile to be a real naval power within a decade.\"\n\n\n\"Does that align with your strategic vision? And should we include fleet construction in our next budget discussions with Diego?\""

Álvaro just said a single war galley costs perhaps 8,000-10,000 florins to build, fully outfit, and crew for a year.\n\nSo 8 galleys would be:\n- Construction and outfitting: 8 × 8,000-10,000 = 64,000-80,000 florins initial cost\n- Annual crew and maintenance: 8 × 4,000-5,000 = 32,000-40,000 florins per year (roughly half the initial cost for ongoing operations based on what Álvaro said earlier)\n\nLet me make sure this is consistent with medieval costs. Álvaro mentioned 20 galleys would be 160,000-200,000 florins initially, which is 8,000-10,000 per ship. That checks out.\n\nHe also mentioned ongoing maintenance and crew costs of 80,000-100,000 florins annually for 20 galleys, which is 4,000-5,000 per galley per year. So for 8 galleys that would be 32,000-40,000 florins annually.\n\nI should have Álvaro break this down clearly and discuss whether this is feasible given their current financial position. They have substantial reserves but many competing priorities.\n\n\nÁlvaro does some quick calculations. \"Eight galleys... let me break down the costs.\"\n\n\nHe ticks off on his fingers. \"Construction cost per galley: approximately 6,000-8,000 florins. That includes the hull, masts, rigging, sails, oars, basic armament. Quality vessels, not cheap merchant conversions. So for eight galleys: 48,000-64,000 florins initial construction cost.\"\n\n\n\"Then outfitting and first year's operations: crews, provisions, weapons, marines, captains' salaries, maintenance. Perhaps 3,000-4,000 florins per galley for the first year. That's another 24,000-32,000 florins.\"\n\n\n\"So total investment to build, outfit, and operate eight galleys for their first year: 72,000-96,000 florins. Call it 80,000-85,000 florins as reasonable middle estimate.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Ongoing costs after first year would be lower - no construction, just crew wages, maintenance, provisions. Perhaps 25,000-30,000 florins annually to keep eight galleys operational.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro looks up. \"From your current financial position - approximately 368,000 florins in crusade treasury and 189,000 florins in crown treasury - this is absolutely affordable. Eight galleys would consume roughly 15% of your crusade treasury or about 45% of crown treasury, depending which you use.\"\n\n\n\"The question is: does this fit with your other priorities? You're planning the Te Deum ceremony, travel to Rome and Basel, Mediterranean commerce infrastructure investment, potentially North African operations, and Constantinople planning. All of these require resources. Building a fleet now means those florins aren't available for other purposes.\"\n\n\nHe considers. \"Alternatively, we could phase construction. Build 4 galleys in 1433 for perhaps 40,000-45,000 florins, see how they perform, then build 4 more in 1434. That spreads the cost and lets us learn from initial experience before committing to full construction program.\"\n\n\n\"What's your thinking on scale and timing?\""

This is historically significant - in the 15th century, there's a transition happening from oar-powered galleys to sail-powered ships. Let me think about this:\n\n1. Galleys (oar-powered):\n- Dominant in Mediterranean for centuries\n- Require large crews (100-200 rowers per galley)\n- Independent of wind, can maneuver in calm\n- Expensive crew costs\n- Good for naval warfare in Mediterranean\n- Fast in short bursts\n- Can ram enemy ships\n\n2. Sailing ships (carracks, caravels, etc.):\n- Emerging technology in 1430s\n- Much smaller crews (30-50 sailors vs 150+ for galley)\n- Dependent on wind\n- Better for long voyages\n- Can carry more cargo\n- Cheaper to operate long-term\n- Higher initial construction cost but lower operating costs\n- Portugal is pioneering these for Atlantic exploration\n\nThe user is thinking economically - sailing ships have lower operating costs because they don't need hundreds of rowers. This is smart thinking. The 15th century is actually the period when sailing ships start to become more viable for warfare and long-distance travel.\n\nFor Juan's purposes:\n- Mediterranean commerce: Sailing ships excellent for cargo\n- North Africa: Could work\n- Constantinople: Long voyage, sailing ships might be better\n- Anti-piracy: Galleys still better for pursuit and combat in Mediterranean\n\nI should present both options fairly, noting the trade-offs. Álvaro would know about this transition since Portuguese are actively developing sailing ship technology, and Juan is married to Portuguese princess.\n\n\nÁlvaro's eyes light up with interest. \"Ah! Now that's forward thinking, Your Majesty. Yes, sailing ships - carracks, caravels, larger merchant vessels that rely primarily on sails rather than oars.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward enthusiastically. \"You're absolutely right about the economics. A war galley needs 120-180 rowers plus 30-40 sailors and marines - perhaps 200 men total. A sailing ship of comparable size needs only 40-60 crew. The wage savings are enormous - perhaps 2,000-2,500 florins annually per galley for rowers versus maybe 500-800 florins for a sailing ship's crew.\"\n\n\n\"Your father-in-law's kingdom is actually pioneering this. Prince Henry - your wife's brother - has been developing new sailing ship designs for Atlantic exploration. Caravels especially - they're smaller than carracks but extremely seaworthy, can sail closer to the wind, and require minimal crew. The Portuguese are using them to explore down the African coast.\"\n\n\nHe holds up a hand, though. \"However, there are significant trade-offs. Galleys have dominated Mediterranean warfare for centuries for good reasons.\"\n\n\nHe counts off on his fingers. \"First: maneuverability in combat. Galleys can move regardless of wind, can turn quickly, can ram enemy vessels. A sailing ship in calm waters is helpless - it drifts. In naval battle, galleys can position themselves to attack while sailing ships wait for favorable wind.\"\n\n\n\"Second: Mediterranean wind patterns. The Mediterranean has frequent calms and unpredictable winds. Galleys work in any conditions. Sailing ships can be becalmed for days, making them unreliable for scheduled operations or rapid response to piracy.\"\n\n\n\"Third: shallow water operations. Galleys have shallow draft, can operate close to shore, can even beach themselves for repairs or to avoid storms. Large sailing ships need deep water harbors and can't operate in coastal shallows where much piracy occurs.\"\n\n\n\"However,\" he continues, warming to the topic, \"sailing ships have major advantages for your purposes. First: cargo capacity. A sailing ship carries perhaps three to four times the cargo of a galley of similar length. For commerce protection and transport operations, this matters greatly.\"\n\n\n\"Second: range and endurance. Sailing ships can voyage for months with just provisions for the crew. Galleys need to stop frequently because feeding 200 men requires enormous supplies. For Constantinople or North African operations, sailing ships enable longer campaigns.\"\n\n\n\"Third: as you noted, operating costs. A fleet of sailing ships costs perhaps one-third to one-quarter as much to maintain annually as galleys. Over decades, the savings are enormous.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth: merchant utility. Sailing ships built for war can also carry cargo during peacetime, generating revenue. War galleys are almost useless except for fighting - too many rowers, not enough cargo space.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro thinks carefully. \"Here's what I'd recommend: a mixed fleet. Build perhaps 4-5 war galleys for Mediterranean patrol, anti-piracy operations, and combat where maneuverability matters. These would cost about 24,000-32,000 florins to build and perhaps 15,000-18,000 florins annually to operate.\"\n\n\n\"Then build 4-5 armed sailing ships - probably carracks of perhaps 200-300 tons. These would cost more initially - perhaps 10,000-12,000 florins each for larger, well-built vessels. So 40,000-60,000 florins construction. But annual operating costs would only be perhaps 8,000-10,000 florins total for all of them.\"\n\n\n\"Total program: 64,000-92,000 florins initial investment, with 23,000-28,000 florins annual operating costs. Slightly more than eight galleys initially, but much cheaper long-term, and you have capability for both Mediterranean combat and long-range operations.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"The sailing ships handle: cargo transport, long voyages, Constantinople supply lines, merchant protection on open water. The galleys handle: close coastal patrol, pursuing pirates in shallows, rapid response operations, combat where wind is unfavorable.\"\n\n\n\"And here's a significant advantage: we could commission the sailing ships from Basque shipyards in the north - they're excellent shipbuilders who specialize in Atlantic-worthy vessels - while building galleys in Málaga using Mediterranean expertise. We'd develop shipbuilding capability in both regions.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you intently. \"Does this mixed approach appeal to you? Best of both maritime traditions, optimized for different roles?\""

The user wants to understand how galleys vs sailing ships fight, which will inform his decision about fleet composition. Let me provide historically accurate information about 15th century naval warfare.\n\nGalleys:\n- Armed primarily with ram at the bow\n- Soldiers/marines on deck for boarding actions\n- Some crossbowmen and archers\n- By 1430s, some have small bombards mounted in the bow\n- Fighting style: ramming, then boarding with infantry\n- Very maneuverable, can position for optimal attack\n- Crew fights as soldiers once ships close\n\nSailing Ships:\n- Castles at bow and stern with soldiers/archers\n- By 1430s, starting to mount bombards/cannons on deck\n- Higher freeboard makes them harder to board\n- Fighting style: archery/missile fire, then boarding if possible\n- Less maneuverable but harder to sink\n- Height advantage over galleys\n\nThis is historically accurate for the period. Naval artillery is just beginning to develop - it's not yet the age of broadsides and ship-of-the-line tactics, but guns are starting to appear on ships.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods, clearly enjoying this tactical discussion. \"Excellent question. The two types fight very differently, which is why both remain relevant.\"\n\n\nHe stands and uses his hands to demonstrate. \"A war galley is essentially a floating platform for soldiers. The primary weapon is the ram - a reinforced bronze or iron-sheathed prow at water level. In battle, the galley rows at full speed directly at an enemy vessel, attempting to hole it below the waterline or shear off its oars. The ram can sink a ship outright or cripple it.\"\n\n\n\"Once ships close, it becomes infantry combat. Galleys carry 30-50 marines and soldiers on deck - heavily armored men with swords, spears, axes. They board enemy vessels and fight hand-to-hand. The deck also has crossbowmen and archers providing missile fire during approach.\"\n\n\n\"Increasingly, galleys are mounting bombards - small cannons - at the bow. One or two guns firing forward. They're not very accurate and take time to reload, but a stone ball can smash through a ship's hull or kill multiple men with one shot. This is relatively new - maybe the last 20 years - but becoming standard for well-equipped galleys.\"\n\n\nHe gestures the naval dance. \"So galley combat is: maneuver using oars regardless of wind, fire arrows and crossbow bolts while approaching, perhaps fire bombard if mounted, attempt to ram, then board with marines for melee combat. It's brutal, direct, and favors the more maneuverable ship. The captain who positions better usually wins.\"\n\n\nThen he shifts to describe sailing ships. \"Sailing ships fight differently. They're taller - high castles at bow and stern, sometimes amidships too. This height advantage is significant. Archers and crossbowmen on the castles can fire down onto enemy decks, while being harder to hit in return.\"\n\n\n\"Larger sailing ships - carracks especially - are starting to mount cannons along the sides. Not many yet, perhaps 6-10 guns total on a large vessel, but this is growing. They fire stone or iron balls that can hole a ship's hull or sweep the deck. Combined with the height advantage and the ability to fire from multiple angles, a well-armed carrack can devastate a galley before it gets close enough to ram.\"\n\n\n\"But,\" he emphasizes, \"sailing ships are slow to maneuver. They need wind, they turn ponderously, they can't position themselves quickly. In calm waters or unfavorable winds, a galley can circle a sailing ship, ram it from behind or the side, and board before the sailing ship can bring its advantages to bear.\"\n\n\nHe sits back down. \"So the tactical reality: In open water with good winds, armed sailing ships dominate. Their height, firepower, and cargo capacity make them superior. A galley trying to close with a well-armed carrack gets torn apart by arrows and cannon fire from above.\"\n\n\n\"But in coastal waters, calms, or narrow spaces where maneuverability matters more than firepower - galleys win. They can choose when and where to fight, ram before the sailing ship can respond, and board with overwhelming numbers of marines.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro spreads his hands. \"This is why Mediterranean naval powers maintain both types. Venice has hundreds of galleys but also maintains armed merchant carracks. Genoa's merchant fleet is mostly sailing ships, but they contract galley squadrons for convoy protection. The Ottomans rely heavily on galleys for their aggressive coastal operations.\"\n\n\n\"For your purposes - Mediterranean patrol and piracy suppression - galleys are probably more useful. Pirates operate in coastal shallows, hide in coves, strike quickly. You need ships that can pursue into shallow water and catch them regardless of wind. A pirate captain sees your sailing ship approaching and just rows into waters too shallow for you to follow.\"\n\n\n\"But for North Africa transport, Constantinople operations, or protecting merchant convoys on long voyages - sailing ships are superior. They can carry more troops and supplies, operate for months without stopping, and their height and firepower make them intimidating to pirates who might challenge a galley.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you seriously. \"So my mixed fleet recommendation stands: 4-5 galleys for Mediterranean patrol and combat, 4-5 armed sailing ships for transport and long-range operations. You'd have the right tool for each mission, rather than trying to make one type do everything.\"\n\n\n\"Does this clarify the tactical considerations? Any other questions about how these vessels would actually be used?\""

This is 1432. Naval artillery is in its very early stages. The first use of cannons on ships was around 1400-1420, and they were very primitive. By the 1430s, some larger ships were beginning to mount small bombards, but this was cutting-edge technology. The broadside cannon arrangement that would dominate naval warfare didn't really develop until the late 1400s and early 1500s.\n\nCarracks were large sailing ships that were developing during this period. They had high forecastles and sterncastles. They could mount some guns, but we're talking about very small numbers - maybe a handful of small bombards. The guns would be mounted on the castles or possibly in the hull, but not in organized gun decks like later ships.\n\nSo Álvaro should clarify that yes, armed carracks would have some guns, but we're talking about very early, primitive naval artillery - perhaps 6-10 small bombards at most. The primary armament would still be archers, crossbowmen, and the height advantage for boarding. The guns are more supplementary than primary weapons at this point in history.\n\nI should have Álvaro explain this clearly, emphasizing that naval gunnery is in its infancy, but it's developing and Castile could be at the forefront of this development.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"Yes, exactly. Carracks are the large sailing ships I'm referring to. They're substantial vessels - perhaps 200-400 tons, with high forecastle and sterncastle, multiple masts with square sails, very seaworthy.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"As for guns... this is relatively new technology. Naval cannon are perhaps 20-30 years old at most. Early experiments were dangerous - heavy iron tubes that sometimes exploded, killing their own crews. But the technology is improving rapidly.\"\n\n\n\"A well-equipped carrack in 1432 might mount perhaps 6-10 small bombards - what we call 'serpentines' or 'falconets'. Small guns, maybe firing stone balls of 3-6 pounds. They're mounted on the castles mostly, perhaps a few in the hull. Nothing like what I understand the Ottomans are beginning to develop with larger ship-mounted cannon.\"\n\n\nHe pauses thoughtfully. \"The guns aren't the primary weapon yet - they're supplementary to archers, crossbowmen, and boarding parties. But they're growing more important each year. A carrack firing 8-10 guns at a galley while maintaining height advantage with archers is formidable. Not unstoppable, but dangerous.\"\n\n\n\"Importantly,\" he continues, \"if we build carracks now, we can design them with gun mounting in mind. The Portuguese and Genoese are experimenting with better gun placement, stronger mountings, ways to fire more guns more safely. We could be at the forefront of this development rather than catching up later.\"\n\n\n\"The Genoese shipwrights we'd hire would bring the latest thinking on naval artillery. And as gun technology improves over the next decade, we could retrofit our ships with better, heavier weapons.\"\n\n\nHe smiles slightly. \"So yes - armed carracks with guns, plus traditional weapons. Not floating fortresses bristling with cannon, but significantly better armed than merchant ships, and improving every year as the technology develops.\"\n\n\n\"Does that answer your question about the armament?\""

Let me break down the costs.\"\n\n\nHe writes as he speaks. \"For the carracks: three standard armed merchant carracks at approximately 11,000 florins each - that's 33,000 florins. These would be well-built, seaworthy vessels capable of both commerce and combat, mounting 8-10 small guns each.\"\n\n\n\"The royal flagship is different. Not just a warship, but a vessel suitable for Your Majesty and the Queen. We'd need: spacious royal quarters with proper furnishings, separate accommodations for ladies-in-waiting and court attendants, perhaps space for 20-30 courtiers total, proper dining facilities, chapel for daily Mass, secure storage for royal items and documents. Plus all the military capabilities - guns, marines, armament.\"\n\n\nHe looks up. \"A proper royal flagship would cost approximately 16,000-18,000 florins. More expensive than a standard carrack, but this is a ship that represents Castile to foreign ports. When you arrive in Constantinople or Venice or anywhere else, this ship announces who you are. It should be impressive - fine woodwork, proper heraldry, comfortable quarters for the Queen. Call it 17,000 florins.\"\n\n\n\"So total carracks: 50,000 florins.\"\n\n\n\"For the galleys: five war galleys at approximately 7,000 florins each for good quality construction. 35,000 florins total.\"\n\n\n\"Total construction cost: 85,000 florins.\"\n\n\nHe continues. \"Then first-year outfitting and operations. The carracks need crews, provisions, finishing work - perhaps 2,000 florins each, so 8,000 florins. The galleys need larger crews and more expensive initial outfitting - perhaps 3,500 florins each, so 17,500 florins. First year operations total: 25,500 florins.\"\n\n\n\"Grand total for construction and first year: approximately 110,500 florins.\"\n\n\nHe looks at your financial position. \"From your current treasuries - 368,000 florins crusade treasury and 189,000 florins crown treasury - this is entirely affordable. Roughly 20% of your crusade treasury or 58% of crown treasury, depending which you use to fund it.\"\n\n\n\"Ongoing costs after the first year would be much lower - just crew wages and maintenance. Perhaps 8,000 florins annually for the four carracks and 15,000 florins annually for the five galleys. 23,000 florins total annual operating cost.\"\n\n\nHe sets down his quill. \"Construction timeline would be approximately 18-24 months for the entire fleet. The Genoese shipwrights would likely start with the flagship since it's most complex, while Málaga yards begin the galleys. We could probably have 2-3 vessels operational by late 1433, the rest by mid-1434.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you with evident approval. \"This gives Castile a genuine naval capability. Not rivaling Venice or Genoa yet, but a serious fleet. The flagship ensures you can travel in appropriate dignity - when you sail to Constantinople, you'll arrive as a king, not a passenger on a hired ship.\"\n\n\n\"Should we include this in the formal budget and begin contracting shipwrights immediately? We'd want to start construction as soon as possible to have vessels ready for your Rome and Basel journey - perhaps the flagship could be ready by summer 1433 if we prioritize it?\""

This is actually an interesting theological/legal question given the context.\n\nLet me think about the arguments:\n\nArguments FOR using crusade treasury:\n1. The papal bull authorized a crusade, and naval power is clearly necessary for crusading operations\n2. North African operations (which Juan is planning) would be crusade-related\n3. Constantinople operations (which Juan is considering) would be crusade-related\n4. Anti-piracy operations protect Christian commerce and pilgrims\n5. The \"perpetual crusade\" doctrine could justify ongoing military capability including naval\n\nArguments AGAINST using crusade treasury:\n1. The fleet would be used for general Castilian purposes, not just crusade\n2. The royal flagship is clearly for Juan's personal use and prestige\n3. Commercial purposes (protecting trade) aren't strictly crusading\n4. Cardinal Capranica and Rome might object to using donated crusade funds for general naval buildup\n5. The crusade treasury is meant for holy war, not general kingdom infrastructure\n\nÁlvaro would likely present both sides but lean toward caution. He's been careful about crusade fund management and Cardinal Capranica is watching. Using crusade funds for a royal flagship that will carry the court around would be questionable.\n\nHowever, some mixed funding might work - galleys for anti-piracy and Mediterranean patrol could arguably be crusade-related, while the flagship and general merchant protection comes from crown treasury.\n\nLet me have Álvaro work through this thoughtfully.\n\n\nÁlvaro pauses, clearly appreciating your careful consideration of this. \"That's... an excellent question, Your Majesty. Let me think through the theological and legal implications.\"\n\n\nHe furrows his brow. \"The crusade treasury was donated by the faithful across Christendom for holy war against the infidel. Cardinal Capranica has been meticulous about ensuring funds are used appropriately. When you return that treasury to Rome, they'll examine how every florin was spent.\"\n\n\n\"Arguments for using crusade funds: Naval power is clearly necessary for crusading operations. If you're planning North African ventures or Constantinople, ships are military equipment for holy war. Anti-piracy operations protect Christian pilgrims and commerce from Muslim raiders. The 'perpetual crusade' doctrine suggests ongoing military capability is justified.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"But arguments against are stronger. The flagship is clearly for your personal use - transporting you, the Queen, and court attendants. That's royal infrastructure, not crusading. The commercial purposes - protecting Málaga trade, generating revenue - aren't holy war. And frankly, explaining to Cardinal Capranica that you used donated crusade funds to build a luxurious royal yacht...\" He winces. \"That would be problematic.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro taps the table thoughtfully. \"However, we could potentially split the costs. The five galleys are clearly military vessels for Mediterranean patrol and anti-piracy - that's defensible as crusade-related if those galleys are primarily used against Muslim pirates and for crusading operations. That's 52,500 florins (35,000 construction + 17,500 first year) from crusade treasury.\"\n\n\n\"The four carracks, especially the royal flagship, should come from crown treasury. These serve broader kingdom purposes, commercial protection, and royal transport. That's 58,000 florins (50,000 construction + 8,000 first year) from crown treasury.\"\n\n\nHe looks at your numbers. \"Crown treasury has 189,000 florins. Spending 58,000 leaves 131,000 - still substantial. The crusade treasury would go from 368,000 to approximately 315,500 - still more than enough for years of operations.\"\n\n\n\"Does that division make sense? Galleys from crusade funds for crusading purposes, carracks from crown funds for general kingdom and royal use?\""

      "say": "Thought process: Dissected Venice's economic advantages versus Castile's continental constraints.\n\nExcellent question from the player. He's right to be puzzled - Venice's naval power is extraordinary and does seem impossible from a Castilian perspective. Let me think through this carefully:\n\nVenice's advantages:\n1. Maritime trade empire - they're THE Mediterranean trading power. Their galleys aren't just military vessels, they're often merchant galleys that carry cargo AND can fight. They generate revenue.\n2. Arsenal system - the Venetian Arsenal is the most advanced shipbuilding facility in the world. Mass production, standardized parts, incredible efficiency. They can build a galley in weeks, not months.\n3. Population and wealth concentration - Venice is extraordinarily wealthy for its size. The city's entire economy is oriented around maritime trade.\n4. Mandatory service - Venetian citizens row galleys as civic duty. The rowers aren't all paid professionals like Castile would need.\n5. Scale economies - when you're building 100 galleys, the per-unit cost drops dramatically.\n6. The galleys ARE their economy - for Venice, naval power isn't an expense, it's the foundation of their wealth. The galleys protect and enable the trade that generates their income.\n\nFor Castile:\n- Land-based kingdom with primarily agricultural economy\n- No existing maritime trade infrastructure\n- Would need to pay for everything - rowers, crews, construction\n- No economies of scale\n- Naval power is an additional expense on top of land army\n\nThis is a great teaching moment about different economic models and why maritime republics work differently from continental kingdoms.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods approvingly. \"Excellent - I'll instruct the shipwrights to incorporate the latest cannon mounting techniques. The Genoese will bring their most current knowledge, and we'll build these ships at the forefront of naval artillery development.\"\n\n\nHe makes a note, then looks up at your question about Venice with a knowing smile. \"Ah. Yes, this puzzles everyone who looks at Venetian naval power. How do they maintain 200-300 war galleys when we struggle to afford nine ships?\"\n\n\nHe leans back, organizing his explanation. \"The answer is that Venice's entire economy and society are fundamentally different from Castile's. We're comparing apples to olive trees.\"\n\n\n\"First and most important: Venice's galleys generate revenue. They're not pure military expense like ours would be. Many Venetian 'war galleys' are actually merchant galleys - armed trading vessels that carry valuable cargo to Constantinople, Alexandria, the Levant, and return with spices, silk, and luxury goods. They can fight if needed, but primarily they're making money through trade. The military capability protects their own cargo.\"\n\n\n\"So while we see '200 galleys' as crushing expense, Venice sees '200 revenue-generating trading vessels that happen to be armed.' The galleys pay for themselves through commerce, then provide military power as a bonus.\"\n\n\nHe continues. \"Second: The Arsenal. Venice has created the most advanced shipbuilding facility in the world - a massive complex called the Arsenale. They've perfected mass production of galleys. Standardized parts, assembly line methods, specialized workers. They can build a complete galley in perhaps 6-8 weeks, versus the 4-6 months it would take us.\"\n\n\n\"This creates enormous cost savings. They buy timber in bulk, they reuse designs, they have workers who do nothing but make oars or sails or rigging. Their per-galley cost is perhaps half what ours would be. And they maintain the galleys more efficiently because they have permanent infrastructure and expertise.\"\n\n\n\"Third: manning the galleys. This is crucial. Venice has perhaps 150,000 people, but their entire population is oriented toward maritime activity. Venetian citizens - especially the lower classes - row galleys as civic duty, paid wages but not mercenary rates. It's expected. Every Venetian male might serve time as an oarsman. For them, it's like our peasants serving in noble levies.\"\n\n\n\"We would need to hire rowers - pay them professional wages to leave their farms or trades and row for years. That's why our galley operating costs are so high. Venice's costs are much lower because rowing is part of being Venetian, not a separate profession requiring high wages.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"Fourth: scale economies and specialization. When you're building and maintaining 200 galleys, everything becomes cheaper per unit. You buy supplies for 200 ships, so merchants give massive discounts. You train sailors in huge classes. You have permanent admirals, naval officers, institutional knowledge. The entire city is a naval machine.\"\n\n\n\"We're starting from almost nothing. Our first nine ships are extraordinarily expensive per unit because we're creating the infrastructure, hiring the expertise, learning the skills. If we eventually had 50 ships, the per-ship cost would drop dramatically.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro spreads his hands. \"Fifth and most fundamental: Venice IS its navy. For them, naval power isn't an expense on top of everything else - it's the foundation of their entire economy and existence. The galleys enable the trade that generates the wealth that builds more galleys. It's a self-reinforcing cycle. They're not a land-based kingdom trying to add a navy; they're a maritime republic whose entire identity is naval power.\"\n\n\n\"Castile, by contrast, is primarily a land-based kingdom. Our wealth comes from agriculture, wool exports, and increasingly from reconquered territory. We're adding naval power to an existing land-based system. For us, ships are an additional expense. For Venice, ships ARE the economy.\"\n\n\nHe softens his tone. \"So you're not poor, Your Majesty - you're just a different kind of power. Venice can field 200 galleys but couldn't possibly field the 35,000-man army you just marched through Granada. Their entire population is 150,000 - they simply don't have the manpower or land-based resources. You just conquered a kingdom larger than Venice's entire territory.\"\n\n\n\"Think of it this way: Venice controls the sea, you control the land. They have naval supremacy in the Mediterranean, you have military supremacy in Iberia. Different strengths, different costs, different advantages.\"\n\n\n\"That said,\" he adds thoughtfully, \"if your Mediterranean commerce develops successfully, and if Málaga becomes a major trading hub, Castile could eventually develop more Venetian-style economics. Trading galleys that generate revenue while providing military capability. But that takes decades to build. Venice has been perfecting this system for 400 years.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"Does that explain why naval power seems so expensive for us but sustainable for them? It's not that we're poor - it's that we're playing a different game with different rules.\""

This is a good practical question about return on investment.\n\nLet me think through this:\n\n1. The ships themselves don't directly generate tax revenue - they're not merchant vessels owned by the crown that trade\n2. However, they can indirectly increase trade tax income by:\n   - Protecting merchant ships from pirates, making trade routes safer\n   - Encouraging more merchants to use Castilian ports (Málaga, Seville) because they're safer\n   - The royal flagship enables diplomatic missions that could secure trade agreements\n   - Naval presence makes insurance costs lower for merchants\n   - Anti-piracy operations make the Mediterranean generally safer for commerce\n\n3. But the effect would be indirect and take time:\n   - Ships need to be built first (18-24 months)\n   - Then they need to establish effective patrol patterns\n   - Merchants need to see that the routes are actually safer\n   - Trade volume needs to increase in response\n   - That increased trade then generates more customs revenue\n\nÁlvaro should be honest that this is a long-term investment, not an immediate revenue generator. The ships will cost money upfront and have ongoing operating costs. Any revenue increase from increased trade would be:\n- Indirect\n- Delayed (probably 2-3 years before significant effect)\n- Difficult to directly attribute to the ships versus other factors\n- Modest initially but growing over time\n\nHe should probably frame this realistically - these ships are primarily a strategic/military investment with some economic benefits, not a pure revenue-generating venture.\n\n\nÁlvaro considers this carefully, clearly wanting to give you an honest assessment rather than overpromising.\n\n\n\"Not directly, no. These aren't merchant vessels we're renting out or trading with ourselves - they're military ships. So they don't generate revenue the way Venetian merchant galleys do.\"\n\n\n\"However,\" he continues, \"they will indirectly support increased trade tax income, though the effect takes time and is hard to quantify precisely.\"\n\n\nHe counts off the mechanisms. \"First: safer trade routes. When merchants know our galleys patrol the coast and actively suppress piracy, they're more willing to use our ports. Ships that might have avoided the western Mediterranean or paid for expensive Genoese convoy protection might instead dock at Málaga if they know it's protected. More ships docking means more customs revenue.\"\n\n\n\"Second: lower costs for merchants. Insurance and security expenses drop when waters are safer. Merchants can carry more cargo with smaller armed escorts. This makes trading through Málaga more profitable for them, which attracts more commerce.\"\n\n\n\"Third: reputation and confidence. A kingdom with its own navy is seen as more stable and powerful. Foreign merchants are more willing to establish permanent operations in ports protected by royal ships rather than hoping for the best.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth: diplomatic leverage. Your royal flagship enables you to travel personally to Venice, Genoa, Constantinople, and negotiate trade agreements directly. You arrive as a king commanding a fleet, not as a supplicant traveling on hired ships. That changes negotiating dynamics considerably.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then provides realistic numbers. \"But I must be clear about timeline and scale. The ships take 18-24 months to build. Then another year or two for merchants to observe that routes are actually safer and adjust their behavior accordingly. So we're looking at perhaps 3-4 years before we see meaningful increase in customs revenue attributable to naval protection.\"\n\n\n\"When it does materialize, the increase might be modest initially - perhaps 2,000-4,000 florins annually in additional customs from increased trade volume at Málaga and other ports. But as our Mediterranean commerce develops and the fleet's reputation grows, that could increase to 10,000-15,000 florins annually within a decade.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"So the honest answer is: these ships are primarily a strategic and military investment, not a revenue generator. They enable your crusading ambitions, protect existing commerce, and provide prestige and diplomatic capability. The economic benefits are real but indirect, delayed, and modest compared to the costs.\"\n\n\n\"Think of it like building a fortress - it doesn't generate revenue directly, but it protects valuable territory and enables other economic activity. The ships protect and enable Mediterranean trade, but they're not profit centers themselves.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"That said, if you want ships that generate direct revenue, we could commission armed merchant carracks instead of or in addition to pure warships. These would carry royal cargo - wool, grain, whatever we're exporting - and generate trading profit while also being capable of self-defense. That's closer to the Venetian model. But it requires getting into the trading business directly, which is a different enterprise with different risks and management needs.\"\n\n\n\"Does that realistic assessment help? Would you like to consider some revenue-generating merchant vessels as well, or stick with the military fleet we've planned?\""
