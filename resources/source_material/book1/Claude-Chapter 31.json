We have just finished drafting the budget for 1432.\n\n\nNow I want to discuss with Alvaro the handing out of titles in western Grenada. \nWhat do you think Alvaro? I want to grant estates to both loyal nobles who are actual on their taxes. And I want to give them out to new nobility. Those nobles starting their own branches or even proven commoners if they have the capacity. I want to give out all territories that are firmly under our control now, which includes almost all ports, a lot of forts and Malaga as well. But maybe not give Malaga away to a noble and let the city keep it's rights?"

What's Álvaro's current status and relationship with Juan?\n3. What's the date and context?\n\nI need to search the project knowledge to understand where we are in the story.\n\nKey points from the user's message:\n- Wants to grant estates to loyal nobles who pay taxes\n- Also wants to create new nobility from proven commoners or new branches\n- Wants to grant territories firmly under control: ports, forts, and Málaga\n- Considering keeping Málaga's city rights rather than granting it to a noble\n\nI should NOT write Juan's dialogue or actions. I should narrate Álvaro's location, demeanor, and then have him respond to Juan's question. I need to keep it SHORT (2-4 paragraphs) since this is a conversation.\n\nLet me search the project knowledge to understand the current state of the conquest and Álvaro's character.\n\n\nI'll search the project knowledge to understand the current situation with the Granada conquest and Álvaro's relationship with Juan.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process\n\nGood, I have context. Let me search for more specific information about Álvaro de Luna's character and relationship with Juan.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Synthesized character context and strategized feudal land distribution response.\n\nGood! Now I have a solid understanding of:\n\n1. **Current situation**: It's Chapter 31, after finishing the 1432 budget. Western Granada has been conquered (Málaga, coastal areas, many forts). The plan is to besiege Granada city in 1432 after taking surrounding fortresses (Alhama, Montefrio, etc.)\n\n2. **Álvaro de Luna's character**: \n   - Royal Constable, Juan's closest advisor\n   - From minor nobility but brilliant administrator and strategist\n   - Deeply hated by many nobles as \"low-born upstart\"\n   - Provides candid advice and reality checks\n   - Proved himself during the Infantes' rebellion\n   - When he praises someone or something, it means a lot\n\n3. **What Juan wants to discuss**: Granting estates in western Granada to:\n   - Loyal nobles who pay taxes on time\n   - New nobility (new branches or proven commoners)\n   - All firmly controlled territories (ports, forts, Málaga)\n   - Keeping Málaga's city rights rather than granting it to a noble\n\nThis is a good strategic discussion about feudalization of conquered territories. Álvaro would have strong opinions on this.\n\nNow I need to write Álvaro's response to Juan's proposal. I should:\n- Keep it SHORT (2-4 paragraphs) since this is a conversation\n- Have Álvaro respond thoughtfully to Juan's ideas\n- NOT write what Juan says or does\n- Stop after Álvaro speaks so the player can respond\n\nLet me set the scene briefly and then have Álvaro respond.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 31: The Distribution of Conquest\n\n\nDate: Late November 1431\nLocation: Royal Palace, Jaén\n\n\n\nYou find Álvaro in the administrative chambers overlooking Jaén's ramparts, surrounded by maps of western Granada marked with garrison positions and supply routes. The evening light catches dust motes drifting through the window as he studies the conquered territories with the focused intensity you've come to recognize.\n\n\nHe looks up as you enter, setting down his quill. \"Your Majesty.\" A slight smile. \"The budget is complete, the Cortes satisfied. Now you're thinking about how to keep what we've taken without bankrupting the crown on garrison costs.\"\n\n\nWhen you present your proposal—estates for tax-paying nobles and proven newcomers, distributing the ports and fortresses, preserving Málaga's municipal rights—Álvaro's eyes narrow thoughtfully. He traces a finger along the coastal fortifications on the map.\n\n\n\"It's brilliant,\" he says flatly. \"And it solves multiple problems at once.\" He taps Málaga. \"Keep the city's fuero—smart. A grateful merchant city pays better taxes than a grasping lord. They'll defend their own privileges fiercely.\" His finger moves to the smaller coastal forts. \"These? Perfect for rewarding loyalty. A fortress on the coast, productive hinterlands, trade income—valuable enough to inspire competition among nobles for your favor.\"\n\n\nHe straightens, arms crossed. \"The new nobility angle—that's where you'll face resistance. Every old house will scream about 'upstarts' and 'diluting noble blood.'\" A dry smile. \"I'd know something about that. But Your Majesty, it's also your shrewdest move. Create nobles who owe everything to you, not ancient family alliances. They'll be loyal because their legitimacy depends on your continued favor.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then adds: \"Three questions before we proceed: First, how do we define 'loyal' and 'current on taxes' without seeming arbitrary? Second, what size estates are we considering—and do recipients provide their own garrisons, or do we subsidize? Third—\" his tone sharpens slightly \"—have you thought about who specifically you want elevated to new nobility? Because that decision will echo for generations.\"\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on his questions?"

Some farms near the vega are not fully under our control for example.

Let me have Álvaro respond to these points and likely ask some follow-up questions. Key elements:\n\n1. Juan is asserting royal prerogative - he decides, nobles don't get a say\n2. 8% tax rate on new estates (consistent with the crusade tax)\n3. Crown support initially for maintaining order\n4. Distribute everything firmly controlled in western Granada\n5. Don Rodrigo gets Ronda (already holds it)\n6. Main Mendoza branch gets rewarded\n7. Lesser nobility who've been loyal\n8. More lands coming from rebel estates\n\nÁlvaro would likely:\n- Appreciate the decisiveness\n- Want clarification on some practical details\n- Think about the political implications\n- Consider the rebel estates separately\n- Maybe suggest a formal structure or process\n\nI should keep this relatively short since we're in an active planning conversation. Maybe 3-5 paragraphs. Stop after Álvaro's questions/suggestions so Juan can respond.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods sharply at your assertion of royal prerogative. \"Good. The moment you start asking nobles for permission to distribute conquered land, you've already lost.\" He returns his attention to the map, making quick notations.\n\n\n\"The 8% rate—consistent with what we just passed through Cortes. That eliminates any complaint about 'special burdens.'\" He traces the western coast with his finger. \"Málaga, Marbella, Estepona, Vélez-Málaga, the interior fortresses... that's substantial territory. Enough to create perhaps fifteen to twenty significant holdings, depending on how we divide them.\"\n\n\nHe looks up. \"Don Rodrigo and the Mendozas—agreed without question. Rodrigo's earned Ronda three times over, and rewarding the main Mendoza branch sends exactly the right message about what cooperation brings.\" A pause. \"For the lesser nobility and potential newcomers, do you want me to prepare a list of candidates? Younger sons of loyal houses, proven military commanders from the crusade, perhaps a few of the more capable converso families who've been generous with funds?\"\n\n\nHis expression grows more serious. \"The rebel estates are a different matter entirely. Baron de Medina, Count of Niebla, Medina-Sidonia—those are major holdings in western Castile. Extremely valuable. Redistributing those will send shockwaves through every noble house in the kingdom.\" He meets your eyes directly. \"That's when the old nobility will truly understand what cooperation versus obstruction means under your reign. It could cement your authority permanently—or trigger desperate resistance from those who see themselves as next.\"\n\n\nHe sets down his quill. \"So: practical sequence. Do we announce the Granada distributions now, at this Cortes while we have momentum? Or wait until after we've dealt with the rebels in February, then distribute everything together as one clear statement of your new order?\""

Through the window, Toledo's winter sun casts pale light across the Tagus. Upstairs, Isabel rests with your newborn daughter—María, named for your sister. The wet nurse and physicians assure you both are recovering well, though Isabel remains weak.\n\n\nÁlvaro has been managing the final preparations for the rebel campaign while you've stayed close to your family these past weeks. Now, with departure looming in days, you turn to the question of the Granada estates.\n\n\n\"Seville,\" Álvaro repeats, nodding. \"After we've taken their fortresses and they've surrendered or been defeated. Public ceremony, immediate oaths of loyalty, clear consequences visible to all.\" He makes a note. \"I'll compile the full list of available Granada titles and ensure the candidates are summoned to Seville for late March or early April, depending on how quickly the rebels fold.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, considering the Castilian estates. \"The rebel lands... you're right to be cautious. We're talking about Baron de Medina, Count of Niebla, and Medina-Sidonia's holdings. Stripping them completely and giving everything to newcomers or rivals would terrify every major house in Castile—they'd see themselves as potentially next.\" He taps the table thoughtfully. \"Perhaps keep some lands in family hands—younger brothers or cousins who weren't part of the rebellion? Shows you're punishing treason, not destroying lineages. The rest we can redistribute as reward for loyalty.\"\n\n\nOn the converso families: \"Excellent. A visible demonstration that conversion and loyalty lead to nobility. That message will resonate across Granada's conquered territories—and perhaps encourage more peaceful surrenders when we move on the capital.\" A slight smile. \"Though I imagine some old Christian nobles will grumble about 'New Christians' rising too fast.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"One practical question: the Granada estates we're distributing—do you want me to gather intelligence on which specific nobles from the lesser houses have been most reliable on taxes and most cooperative with royal authority? Give you names and records so you can make informed choices? Or do you prefer to rely on your own observations and relationships?\""

Let me search for this.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Ascertained Italian painter's arrival status and Toledo lodging arrangements.\n\nThe user is asking about a painter from Italy. Looking at the search results, I can see that Fra Angelico was commissioned to paint the wedding of Juan and Isabel. According to Chapter 24:\n\n- Fra Angelico was commissioned in response to a letter from Pope Martin V personally\n- The commission was for 500 florins plus 300 florins monastery donation\n- Timeline was five months (January-June 1432)\n- Fra Angelico and his assistant Brother Giuliano would stay at Dominican monastery of Santo Tomás in Toledo\n- The commission was accepted and arrangements were made for winter 1431-32\n\nGiven that we're now in mid-February 1432, and the timeline was January-June 1432, Fra Angelico should have arrived in Toledo by now (or be arriving soon). He would be staying at the Dominican monastery of Santo Tomás in Toledo.\n\nThe user wants to pose for the painting while in Toledo, which makes sense given the timeline.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods at your instructions. \"Eight percent with revenue reassessments every decade—that ensures the crown's share grows with the estates' prosperity. I'll draft the charters accordingly.\" He makes a final note on his papers.\n\n\nAt the mention of the painter, his expression shifts to something almost pleased. \"Fra Angelico arrived three weeks ago, Your Majesty.

Brother Giuliano—his assistant—has been mixing pigments and preparing panels.\"\n\n\nA dry smile touches Álvaro's lips. \"He also spent two hours interviewing me about the exact positioning of the banner and relics during the ceremony. Very... thorough. He treats this painting as if it were a holy act in itself.\" He pauses. \"Which, from what I understand of Fra Angelico, it is.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"He's expressed particular interest in painting you in your white armor with your father's sword. And he wants Isabel present for several sessions so he can capture—and I'm quoting—'the grace God has given her face when she prays.' He seems to believe the painting should show not just the wedding, but the... spiritual reality of what was happening.\"\n\n\n\"Shall I send word to Santo Tomás that you're available to begin?\""

I'll send a messenger ahead to inform the prior that you're coming.\"\n\n\nWithin the hour, you're riding through Toledo's winter streets toward the Dominican monastery of Santo Tomás, accompanied by a small escort. The monastery sits on the city's edge, a severe stone structure that seems to embody the Dominican commitment to learning and contemplation.\n\n\nThe prior greets you personally at the gate, bowing deeply. \"Your Majesty, Fra Giovanni is in the chapter house where we've given him workspace. He's been... quite absorbed in his preparations.\" There's fondness in the old prior's voice. \"He asked me to apologize in advance if he seems distracted—when he works, he prays, and when he prays, he is not always present to earthly conversation.\"\n\n\nThe prior leads you through quiet cloisters to a large room flooded with northern light. The space has been transformed into a painter's workshop—panels of prepared wood lean against walls, jars of pigments line a table in careful rows, and dozens of drawings cover every surface.\n\n\nFra Giovanni da Fiesole stands before a large drawing board, his Dominican habit paint-stained, a piece of charcoal in his hand. He's perhaps forty-five, thin and ascetic, with an intensity in his dark eyes that speaks of someone who sees beyond the material world. When he notices you, he sets down the charcoal immediately and bows—not with courtly flourish, but with genuine reverence.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His voice is quiet, accented Italian. \"Forgive me—I did not hear you arrive. I was...\" he gestures at the drawing before him, \"...trying to understand how the light fell on the banner during your wedding. The prior described it, but I wanted to see if I could capture the moment when sacred objects make light itself holy.\"\n\n\nHe steps aside so you can see his work. The drawing shows the cathedral interior with remarkable precision—every column, every arch—but what strikes you is how he's sketched rays of light falling across the white banner and the reliquaries, as if the light itself were bowing before the holy objects.\n\n\n\"I have many questions for Your Majesty,\" Fra Giovanni says, his eyes meeting yours with unexpected directness. \"But first—may I ask why you wanted this painted? Not for posterity, I think. Not for glory. There is another reason.\"\n\n\nHe waits for your answer."

      "say": "Let me start at the beginning Fra Giovanni. I have been a king for as long as I can remember. I was crowned as a child and did pretty much everything my advisors told me to. A few years ago I started to think for myself, started to have ideas of my own. It became apparent to me that my nobles did not like that. And that the difference between a good and a bad choice was not the same as following wise council or not. What is really good in this world Fra? What seperates us from a sinful life? It was then that I started to have flashes of what I can only describe as God's kingdom on earth.\n\n\nI dont know what the first vision actually was, but I do remember one very vividly from a few years ago. It is the oldest I can remember. It was an older brother who's family was working at the palace. He had just earned himself half a bread for his work for the day. He gathered his younger siblings around him and divided the bread among them equally. He kept the smaller piece for himself and smiled as he watched his younger brothers and sisters skip away to eat their piece of bread. I saw it Fra, God's grace.\n\n\nI started to see it more often after that. A mother brushing the dust off of her son who has been playing in the forest. A grandfather teaching his grandson how to farm. A stone mason tirelessly labouring away to build a city...and I started to see it in some prayers as well. Some people really pray Fra. It does not happen most of the times but sometimes a prayer is so profound that I just know that a connection with the divine is made.\n\n\nLater I saw this sliver of God's kingdom in my wife as well, which is why her sickness has struck me so hard. And I see it of course in my beautiful daughter. I know that she is just a normal baby like anyone else, but she is sacred to ME. All I want is to build this kingdom higher and close to the image of God's kingdom so that when I die, I leave this world for her to inherit, more just, more fair and closer to heaven than when I found it.\n\n\nBut I get ahead of myself. About two years ago, I saw a vision of what God's kingdom on this earth would look like. I could not stop thinking about it. I knew that as king, I had an obligation to remake my kingdom in his image as much as possible. I started to see the scheming of my nobles for what it really was and I also saw and knew what I had to do. I started on my pilgrimage to rome and what happened after that is public knowledge. My pilgrimage, my father's sword, my meeting with the pope, the crusade, my campain, battles everything. But it all started with this sliver of God's kingdom on earth.\n\n\nI aim to make this world more just and better Fra. It is all I think about. Where me and my wife live happily, and other mothers and fathers as well. And I know we will never reach it. My wife is very sick right now...and may never have another child again. We can only strive towards this goal. But sometimes, we succeed. We succed for just a small fraction of a moment Fra. Blink and it is gone. But in that moment when I see God's grace I can live forever.\n\n\nWhen I was crowned, I was granted the papal bull and all of christendom had rallied to this cause. Isabel was young, beautiful and had yet to endure the ordeal of her pregnancy. The world was full of promise. In that tiny moment, everything was right. In that moment, I felt like I had stepped into God's kingdom.\n\n\nThe painting itself is for my own selfish enjoyment mostly. I know what it represents to me. I hope it will allow me to recollect the moment, to see God's kingdom again like I did at that moment. That it may remind me and give me clarity when I pray before it.\n\n\nAnd maybe, maybe, it can allow others to see it too.\n\n\nThat is what you will be painting Fra."

Brother Giuliano has stopped his grinding, though he keeps his eyes respectfully lowered.\n\n\nFinally, Fra Giovanni crosses himself slowly. \"Your Majesty...\" His voice is quiet but firm. \"What you describe—these moments when heaven touches earth—Saint Thomas Aquinas would call them glimpses of the beatific vision. Not the full vision, which comes only after death, but... reflections. Like seeing light through a crack in a door.\"\n\n\nHe moves to the window, looking out over Toledo's rooftops. \"I paint in a monastery cell in Florence. Sometimes, when the light falls just so on the faces of the brothers at prayer, or when I see one tend a sick brother with perfect gentleness—I see it too. That moment when the world is as God intended. When everything is...\" he searches for the word, \"...right. As if creation itself remembers Eden for just an instant.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to you. \"Most men who commission paintings want glory captured. They want their power immortalized, their victories celebrated. You want me to paint grace.\" He says it not as criticism but as recognition. \"You want me to show the moment when a human ceremony—a wedding, a coronation—became something more. When heaven bent down and touched earth.\"\n\n\nFra Giovanni approaches one of his sketches—the one showing light falling on the banner. \"I understand now why Pope Martin commanded this on his deathbed. He saw the same thing you do—that for one moment in that cathedral, the Kingdom was present. Really present.\" He looks at you directly. \"This is not a painting of your wedding, Your Majesty. This is a painting of grace made visible.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then asks quietly: \"When you saw this moment—when you felt you had stepped into God's kingdom—what was the thing that told you it was real? Was it the light? The faces? Your wife's expression? The banner?\" His voice becomes urgent. \"I must know what made it real to you, or I will paint only appearance, not truth.\""

At the moment itself I saw God's kingdom more through the lens of a king and administrator. All nobles loyal, laws just and fair, the realm united. I had just met my wife and we found common ground in faith. Having her by my side as queen felt right. A wife supporting her husband in her role. And me as husband supporting her in my way. The promise of children and an heir felt so natural back then. It felt like everything was in it's rightful place. Perfect, untainted by worldly disease, pain and suffering. I had never gone to war yet. And Isabel had yet to give birth.\n\n\nWhat do you think when I discribe it like that?"

Juan is being deeply honest with Fra Giovanni about how his understanding of that \"perfect moment\" has changed. He saw it as administrative perfection, political harmony, the promise of heirs—but now, after war (seeing death, making hard decisions) and after Isabel's difficult childbirth (the reality of suffering, the possibility she may never have another child, watching someone he cares about in pain), his understanding has deepened and become more complex.\n\nFra Giovanni, as a Dominican friar and a deeply spiritual artist, would recognize this immediately. He would see that Juan has moved from an idealized, somewhat naive vision of \"everything in its place\" to a more mature, more painful understanding of grace—one that acknowledges suffering, limitation, and mortality.\n\nFra Giovanni would probably respond with compassion but also with theological depth. He might point out that Juan's initial vision wasn't wrong, but incomplete. That the Kingdom of God includes both the hope of perfection AND the reality of the cross. That grace is most visible not in the absence of suffering, but in how it transforms suffering.\n\nThis is a crucial character development moment for Juan. He's maturing, becoming less idealistic but more genuinely faithful. Fra Giovanni would recognize this as spiritual growth, not loss.\n\nI should have Fra Giovanni respond with wisdom that both validates Juan's initial vision and helps him understand his current, more complex understanding as deeper rather than as a loss of innocence.\n\n\nFra Giovanni is silent for a long moment, his eyes searching your face. Then he moves to sit on a simple wooden stool, gesturing for you to sit as well if you wish. Brother Giuliano quietly excuses himself, sensing this conversation requires complete privacy.\n\n\n\"I think,\" Fra Giovanni says slowly, \"that you saw truly—but you saw as Adam saw Eden before the Fall. Everything in its place, everything as it should be, no shadow of pain or death. A kingdom of pure order and promise.\" He pauses. \"And now you have tasted the apple, Your Majesty. You have seen men die in battle. You have watched your wife suffer in childbirth, perhaps lose the ability to give you more children. You have learned that even when everything is in its 'rightful place,' the world still contains pain.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward slightly. \"Many men, when they learn this, become cynical. They decide their first vision was childish foolishness. They harden their hearts and say, 'There is no Kingdom, only power and suffering.'\" His eyes intensify. \"But you have not done this. You still believe in those moments of grace—you simply understand them differently now.\"\n\n\nHe stands and moves to one of his sketches—this one showing your face during the ceremony. \"When I paint the Kingdom made visible, I cannot paint Eden. Eden is gone. What I must paint is...\" he struggles for words, \"...is the Kingdom breaking through despite the shadow of the Cross. Grace that exists even knowing what suffering costs. Hope that survives loss.\"\n\n\nFra Giovanni turns back to you. \"Your Majesty, the moment in that cathedral was real. But it was not real because everything was perfect—untainted, as you say. It was real because in that moment, you chose to serve something greater than yourself, knowing—even if you did not fully understand it then—that it would cost you everything. That is what made it sacred. Not the absence of suffering, but the decision to love despite knowing suffering will come.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to his drawings. \"So I ask you again, but differently: In that moment in the cathedral—knowing what you know now, having seen war and birth and loss—what would you want someone looking at this painting to feel? What truth do you want captured?\""

Juan is revealing something very personal - that Isabel, who seemed like such a secondary character at first (rolled mediocre on appearance and personality), has become the emotional and spiritual center of his vision of God's kingdom. \n\nFra Giovanni is a Dominican friar and a brilliant religious artist. He would understand this theologically and artistically. The shift from \"kingdom as perfect administration\" to \"kingdom as love embodied in a suffering, selfless person\" is actually a very Christian insight - it mirrors Christ himself. \n\nFra Giovanni would recognize this as genuine spiritual growth - from seeing the Kingdom as order to seeing it as sacrificial love. This is profound and would move him deeply as both a theologian and an artist.\n\nI need to:\n1. Have Fra Giovanni respond with the depth this deserves\n2. Show that he understands the theological significance\n3. Make clear how this will shape his painting\n4. Keep it in character for a Dominican friar who paints as prayer\n5. This is a short response moment - Fra Giovanni absorbing and responding, not a long scene\n\nThis is beautiful character development for Juan. Isabel, who could have been just a political piece, has become his anchor to understanding divine love through her suffering and selflessness.\n\n\nFra Giovanni stands very still, and for the first time since you met him, you see his eyes glisten with tears. He makes no move to hide them.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, his voice thick with emotion, \"you have just described the Incarnation. God did not save us by showing us a perfect world untouched by suffering. He saved us by entering our suffering—taking flesh, knowing pain, dying on a Cross—and loving us anyway. Through the suffering, not around it.\"\n\n\nHe moves to the sketch of Isabel. You hadn't noticed it before, but he's captured her face with extraordinary care—not made beautiful beyond truth, but showing exactly what you just described. The shy devotion. The quiet selflessness. The fragility and the strength together.\n\n\n\"She is the heart of this painting,\" Fra Giovanni says simply. \"Not the banner. Not the relics. Not even you, Your Majesty—though you are the king and the crusader.\" He touches the drawing gently. \"She is the one who shows what the Kingdom actually is. Not power made perfect, but love made vulnerable. Not glory untouched by sorrow, but grace that persists through it.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"I will paint her as she was in that moment—young, full of promise, before the suffering of childbirth. But I will paint her in such a way that anyone who looks at this painting will understand: this is what is worth protecting. This is what makes the crusade holy. Not conquest. Not even faith as an idea. But faith as embodied in a person who loves without counting the cost.\"\n\n\nHis voice drops to barely a whisper. \"When you pray before this painting in the years to come, when campaigns have ground you down and kingdoms have disappointed you—you will see her face, and remember why you fight. Not for perfect kingdoms that can never exist in this fallen world. But for people like her, who show us glimpses of Eden even in exile.\"\n\n\nHe wipes his eyes unselfconsciously. \"Yes, Your Majesty. This is the answer I sought. Now I know what I am painting.\""

Let me check what was described in the project knowledge about this.\n\nFrom the Chapter 24 summary, I found this:\n\n\"**Second: Devotional Piece for Isabel**\nA smaller work for Isabel's private chapel depicting the Virgin Mary interceding before Christ for crusaders. Something Isabel could pray before, reminding her that her prayers and Juan's both rise before God's throne.\"\n\nSo Fra Angelico had proposed a devotional piece for Isabel's private chapel showing the Virgin Mary interceding for crusaders. This was meant to be something Isabel could pray before while Juan was away at war.\n\nGiven the conversation we just had about Isabel's nature - her constant prayer for others, her selflessness, her suffering - Fra Angelico would likely have deeper insights about why this second painting is important for her specifically. He would understand that Isabel needs spiritual support while Juan is away at war, and that she prays constantly for him and for his enemies.\n\nI should have Fra Angelico explain his vision for this devotional piece in light of what Juan has just revealed about Isabel's character and their relationship.\n\n\nFra Giovanni nods, moving to another section of his workspace where a smaller preparatory sketch rests. \"Yes—a devotional piece for the Queen's private chapel. When I proposed it, I knew only that she was pious and that you would be away at war for long periods. But now...\" he looks at the sketch thoughtfully, \"...now I understand her much better.\"\n\n\nHe picks up the drawing. \"I proposed depicting the Virgin Mary interceding before Christ for crusaders. The theological concept is sound—Mary as advocate, presenting the prayers of the faithful to her Son. But the reason for this painting is Isabel herself.\"\n\n\nHe turns to you. \"Your Majesty, when you are in Granada leading armies, facing battle, making life and death decisions—who do you think suffers more? The warrior in the field, or the wife in the chapel praying for his safe return?\" He doesn't wait for an answer. \"Both suffer. But the warrior has action. He has purpose visible before him. The wife has only prayer and waiting.\"\n\n\nFra Giovanni sets the sketch down carefully. \"Isabel will pray for you every day you are gone. She will pray through her own pain, through her recovery, through her fears. She needs to see—visually, tangibly—that her prayers matter. That they reach heaven. That her suffering has purpose.\"\n\n\nHis voice becomes gentle. \"The Virgin Mary understands what Isabel feels. Mary watched her Son go to war against sin and death itself. She could not fight for Him. She could not protect Him. She could only pray, and trust, and suffer alongside Him.\" He pauses. \"When Isabel prays before this painting, she will see Mary presenting crusaders—presenting you—to Christ. She will know that her prayers are heard. That her vigil has meaning.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you seriously. \"This painting is not for public display, Your Majesty. This is for her private devotion. For the moments when she is alone, frightened, wondering if prayer is enough. It will tell her: Yes. Your prayers matter. You are not helpless. You are partnering with heaven itself.\"\n\n\nHe touches the sketch lightly. \"What do you think? Does this serve what she needs?\""

This will be an intimate, meaningful scene.

To speak with her about the painting?\" He seems genuinely moved by this. \"Most nobles commission paintings of their wives without consulting them at all. They treat them as... ornaments to be captured.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you with new understanding. \"You truly see her. Not just love her—see her.\" He crosses himself. \"Yes. I should meet her.

Within minutes, the three of you are walking back through the monastery, then riding through Toledo's streets toward the royal palace.\n\n\n\nThe palace is quiet in the late afternoon. Servants move softly through corridors, mindful that the Queen is resting. You lead Fra Giovanni and Brother Giuliano up the stairs toward Isabel's chambers, where Dona Beatriz stands guard outside the door.\n\n\nShe curtsies when she sees you. \"Your Majesty. The Queen is awake—she's been sitting with the baby.\" Her eyes flick curiously to the two Dominicans. \"Shall I announce you?\"\n\n\n\"Please,\" you say. \"Tell her I've brought someone I want her to meet—someone important for the painting of our wedding.\"\n\n\nDona Beatriz disappears inside, and you hear quiet Portuguese voices. After a moment, she returns. \"The Queen will receive you, Your Majesty. She asks only a moment to... compose herself.\"\n\n\nWhen you finally enter, Isabel is sitting in a chair by the window, sunlight falling across her face. She's dressed simply in a modest gown, her hair braided loosely. Little María sleeps in a cradle beside her. Isabel looks pale and tired, but her eyes are clear. When she sees the two Dominican friars, she immediately moves to rise.\n\n\n\"Please, Your Majesty—don't,\" Fra Giovanni says quickly, bowing deeply. \"You are recovering. We are honored you receive us at all.\"\n\n\nIsabel settles back, her hands folded in her lap. She looks at you questioningly, then at the painter, waiting."

Or recognition.\n\n\n\"Yes,\" she whispers. \"Yes, it would bring me great comfort.\" She turns to Fra Giovanni, still kneeling before her chair. \"Fra Giovanni, when you paint the Virgin's face... can you show that she is praying with me? Not just presenting my prayers, but... joining them? Adding her prayers to mine?\"\n\n\nHer voice grows slightly stronger. \"Because when I am alone and frightened, I need to know I am not truly alone. That she is beside me, praying alongside me for...\" she glances at you, \"...for my husband's safety. For our daughter. For all the men fighting. That we are praying together.\"\n\n\nShe wipes her eyes with her sleeve, unselfconscious. \"I know that sounds simple, perhaps even childish. But that is what would help me most. To see that I have a companion in heaven who understands and prays with me.\"\n\n\nShe looks back at you, squeezing your hand. \"When you are in Granada facing battles I cannot even imagine, I will go to that chapel and pray before that painting. And I will know that even though I cannot be with you, even though I am just...\" she struggles for words, \"...just a woman in a room saying words... that somehow, through Mary's intercession, my love reaches you. That it matters.\"\n\n\nHer eyes search your face. \"Does that make sense?\""

This makes perfect sense given that János Hunyadi is there specifically with expertise fighting Ottomans.\n\n\nÁlvaro pauses, then reaches for another set of documents, his expression shifting to mild chagrin. \"Ah—you're quite right, Your Majesty. I was focused on the experts and neglected the actual troops.\" He scans the papers quickly.\n\n\n\"The full picture of foreign military support arriving or already here:\n\n\nForeign Troops Currently in Castile or En Route:\n\n\nFrance: 300 veteran soldiers under Captain Jean de Metz—these men fought with Joan of Arc herself. They arrived in Seville in early January. Professional, disciplined, experienced in siege warfare.\n\nBurgundy: 30 Burgundian knights under Antoine de Toulongeon—Philip the Good's personal Master-at-Arms. Elite heavy cavalry. Arrived in Toledo last week.\n\nGermany: 150 German knights under Heinrich von Plauen, a Teutonic Knight commander. They're assembling in stages—about 80 have arrived, the rest expected by March.\n\nMilan: Eight condottieri captains with small retinues—perhaps 50-60 men total. Elite professionals. Most are in Seville.\n\nHungary: János Hunyadi arrived two weeks ago with a staff of six experienced officers who've fought the Ottomans for years.\"\n\n\nHe looks up. \"So approximately 550-600 foreign troops total, plus the fifteen military experts I mentioned. Most are in Seville preparing for the campaign season, though the Burgundian knights and Hunyadi's staff are here in Toledo.\"\n\n\n\nAt your proposal to gather everyone at the academy, Álvaro's eyes light up. \"An excellent idea, Your Majesty. And the timing is perfect—we have perhaps the greatest concentration of anti-Muslim military expertise in one place that Christendom has seen in decades.\"\n\n\nHe stands, energized. \"János Hunyadi has been begging to discuss Ottoman tactics with anyone who'll listen. The man has fought them for years—he knows their strengths, their weaknesses, how they adapt. Captain Jean de Metz commanded infantry against fortified positions. Francesco Sforza revolutionized Italian combined-arms warfare. The German knights bring traditional heavy cavalry doctrine. We can synthesize all of this.\"\n\n\nHe moves to the door. \"I'll send messengers immediately. Gather everyone at the Military Academy tomorrow morning? The Burgundian knights, Hunyadi and his staff, Captain de Metz if he can ride from Seville quickly enough—though that's four days. The condottieri representatives, the German commanders, our own experienced officers like the Master of Calatrava...\"\n\n\nHe pauses at the threshold. \"This will be extraordinary, Your Majesty. Not just a briefing, but a genuine council of war drawing on experience from every corner of Christendom. Hunyadi's intelligence on Ottoman methods could be invaluable when we eventually look beyond Granada.\"\n\n\n\"Shall I arrange for tomorrow morning? And do you want this to be a private council, or invite select Castilian nobles who might benefit from the discussion?\""

Álvaro had summoned them weeks ago at your request, and they've traveled from across the kingdom.\n\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez Álvarez de Toledo sits at the head of the table in his capacity as Primate of Spain, flanked by a dozen bishops and abbots. The mood is tense. Everyone knows what's at stake in Basel.\n\n\nThe Archbishop rises when you enter, and the assembly bows. \"Your Majesty. We are assembled as you requested, to discuss the Council of Basel and Castile's participation.\"\n\n\nHe gestures for you to take the seat of honor. Once you're settled, he continues: \"Your Majesty, the situation in Basel grows more troubling by the week. Pope Eugenius IV attempted to dissolve the council in December, but the assembled prelates refused to disperse. They've declared that councils derive authority directly from Christ—not from the Pope—and therefore the Holy Father cannot dissolve them.\"\n\n\nBishop Álvaro de Isorna of Cuenca, an older man with sharp eyes, leans forward. \"This is the Hussite heresy all over again, Your Majesty. First they question papal authority in Bohemia. Now French and German bishops question it at Basel. Where does it end?\"\n\n\nBut the Bishop of Palencia, younger and more reform-minded, counters: \"With respect, my lord of Cuenca, the Council raises legitimate concerns about church governance. The Pope cannot reform the church alone—we've seen how personal interests corrupt. The councils provide checks against abuse.\"\n\n\nThe Archbishop raises his hand, forestalling argument. \"We are not here to debate the theological merits, brothers. We are here because His Majesty must decide: Does Castile send representatives to Basel? And if so, what position do they take?\"\n\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"Your Majesty, you have unique standing. Pope Martin V blessed your crusade personally. Cardinal Capranica served as your legate. You have papal favor unlike any Iberian monarch in living memory.\" He pauses. \"But the new Pope Eugenius and the Council are at war.

He's been focused on the crusade and hasn't deeply engaged with the ecclesiological debates of the early 15th century. The churchmen would be happy to explain this to him.\n\nThe key issues:\n1. The Great Schism (1378-1417) - multiple competing popes\n2. The Council of Constance (1414-1418) - resolved the schism by deposing popes\n3. The decree \"Haec Sancta\" - declared councils superior to popes\n4. The decree \"Frequens\" - required regular councils\n5. Now Basel is asserting these principles against Pope Eugenius IV\n\nThe churchmen would have different perspectives:\n- Some see councils as necessary checks on papal power\n- Some see councils as threats to church unity and hierarchy\n- Some are pragmatic about church politics\n- All are concerned about Castile's position\n\nI should have multiple bishops explain different aspects, creating a nuanced discussion that educates Juan (and the player) about the historical context.\n\n\nThe Archbishop nods gravely. \"A fair question, Your Majesty. Let me explain the crisis we face.\"\n\n\nHe settles back in his chair. \"The issue is not whether we are Christians—we all are. The question is: Who governs the Church? Does ultimate authority rest with the Pope alone, as Vicar of Christ? Or with councils of bishops, who claim to speak for the whole Church?\"\n\n\nBishop Alfonso de Cartagena of Burgos, known as one of Castile's finest scholars, speaks up. \"Your Majesty, to understand the present, we must remember the recent past. From 1378 to 1417—nearly forty years—the Church was torn by schism. Two popes, sometimes three, all claiming to be the true successor of Peter. Rome had one pope, Avignon another. Christendom was divided, each pope excommunicating the other's followers.\"\n\n\nThe Bishop of Palencia continues the history: \"The Council of Constance, which met from 1414 to 1418, resolved this crisis. But how? The council deposed all three competing popes and elected a new one—Pope Martin V, who blessed your crusade. The council declared that it possessed authority directly from Christ, and that even popes must submit to it in matters of faith and church reform.\"\n\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez adds: \"The council issued a decree called Haec Sancta—'This Holy Synod.' It stated that councils have their power directly from Christ, and that everyone, including the Pope, must obey them. It also decreed regular councils must be held—every ten years at minimum.\"\n\n\nBishop de Isorna interjects sharply: \"But Pope Martin V never fully accepted these decrees! He viewed the Council of Constance as an emergency measure during schism, not a permanent change in church governance. He believed that once the crisis passed, normal papal supremacy should resume.\"\n\n\nThe younger Bishop of Ávila speaks carefully: \"And that, Your Majesty, is the heart of our current crisis. Pope Eugenius IV sees Basel as a threat to his authority. The council is demanding reforms—reduction of papal taxes, limits on papal appointments, financial accountability. The Pope views this as rebellion. The council views it as legitimate governance.\"\n\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez looks at you soberly: \"So when you ask 'why do some Christians doubt the office of the Pope'—they don't doubt the office exists. They question whether the Pope stands above the Church, or within it subject to councils. It's a fundamental question about the very structure of Christendom.\"\n\n\nBishop de Cartagena adds: \"And Your Majesty, there are legitimate concerns on both sides. Without strong papal authority, we risk returning to schism—local churches going their own way, unity shattered. But without conciliar checks, we risk papal tyranny—corruption, nepotism, worldly ambition unchecked.\"\n\n\nThe room falls quiet, waiting for your response to this explanation.\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts?"

They know Juan is deeply religious and has papal favor, but they also know church history. They would balance respect for the papal office with historical reality.\n\nThis is a teaching moment for Juan about the institutional church versus spiritual ideals.\n\n\nA heavy silence falls over the chamber. The churchmen exchange glances—some uncomfortable, others resigned. Finally, Archbishop Gutiérrez speaks with careful honesty.\n\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. Even popes.\"\n\n\nHe stands and moves to the window, looking out over Toledo. \"The office of the papacy is sacred—the unbroken line from Saint Peter to today. But the men who hold that office remain men, subject to temptation like all of us.\" He turns back to you. \"Pope Martin V, who blessed you so generously, was by all accounts a holy man. But even he was not above criticism. He appointed five of his own relatives as cardinals. He enriched his family, the Colonnas, beyond measure.\"\n\n\nBishop de Cartagena speaks gently, as if explaining something painful: \"Your Majesty, in the past century alone we have seen popes who were warriors first and priests second. Pope Julius II will be remembered as much for leading armies as for spiritual leadership. Some popes have had mistresses, acknowledged bastard children, sold church offices to the highest bidder.\"\n\n\nThe Bishop of Palencia adds: \"The current Pope Eugenius IV—by all accounts a decent man—dissolved the Council of Basel partly because it threatened his family's interests in Florence. The Condulmer family benefits greatly from his papacy. Is that worldly ambition? Or legitimate concern for his kinsmen?\"\n\n\nBishop de Isorna, the conservative, feels compelled to defend: \"But Your Majesty, we must distinguish between the office and the man! Even if individual popes sin—and they do, for all have sinned and fall short—the authority of the Keys remains. Christ promised the gates of Hell would not prevail against His Church. That promise holds regardless of human weakness.\"\n\n\nThe Abbott of San Benito de Valladolid, who has been silent until now, speaks with the quiet authority of age: \"Your Majesty, I am seventy-three years old. I have lived under seven popes. Some were saints. Some were scoundrels. Most were men trying their best while struggling with power, wealth, and pride.\" He looks at you with kind eyes. \"The question before Basel is not whether popes can be corrupt—history proves they can. The question is: what structure best protects the Church when they are?\"\n\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez returns to his seat. \"Your Majesty, you met Pope Martin V at perhaps his finest moment—a dying man making peace with God, using his last strength to bless a true crusade. You saw the best of what the papacy can be.\" He pauses. \"But the office has not always been held by men like that. And it may not be again.\"\n\n\nHe folds his hands. \"The conciliarists at Basel argue that regular councils of bishops—men who cannot all be corrupted at once—provide better governance than one man with absolute power, however holy that office may be. The papalists argue that strong central authority is the only thing preventing chaos and heresy.\"\n\n\nThe room waits. Your question has opened a difficult truth: the Church you love and serve is governed by fallible men, even at its highest levels.\n\n\nHow does this revelation sit with you?"

Let me think about this historically:\n\n1. The Castilian clergy in 1432 would NOT be uniformly reform-minded or sympathetic to conciliarism\n2. Castile was historically very loyal to Rome - they benefited from papal authority\n3. The Spanish church was quite conservative and would be suspicious of Basel\n4. Many Castilian bishops would see the Hussites as dangerous heretics, not reformers\n5. The conciliar movement would be viewed with suspicion by many\n6. There would be much more diversity of opinion - some hardliners, some moderates, maybe a few sympathetic to reform\n\nThe player is absolutely right. I made the churchmen too uniformly pragmatic and balanced. In reality:\n- Many would be horrified by Basel's challenge to papal authority\n- The Castilian church benefited from Rome's centralized system\n- They would fear that weakening the Pope weakens church hierarchy generally\n- Most would be very anti-Hussite\n- There should be more conservative voices defending absolute papal authority\n- Only a minority would be sympathetic to conciliar reforms\n\nI need to rewind and present a more historically accurate, diverse gathering where:\n- Conservative bishops dominate (defending papal supremacy)\n- A few moderate reformers exist but are in minority\n- Strong anti-Hussite sentiment\n- Fear that Basel leads to chaos and heresy\n- Concern about what reforms might mean for Spanish church privileges\n\nThe player caught an important historical inaccuracy. Let me acknowledge this and restart the scene with more accurate characterization.\n\n\nYou're absolutely right to call this out. Let me restart this scene with a more historically accurate representation.\n\n\nThe Castilian clergy in 1432 would be predominantly conservative and pro-papal. Castile benefited enormously from strong papal authority—the reconquista was justified by papal bulls, church wealth and privileges were protected by Rome, and the Spanish church hierarchy had a vested interest in maintaining the Roman system. They would be deeply suspicious of Basel and horrified by the Hussites.\n\n\nLet me revise:\n\n\n\nREWIND - THE CHURCH COUNCIL (Earlier in February 1432)\n\n\nThe assembled churchmen fill the chamber, and the atmosphere is considerably more tense and fractious than I initially portrayed.\n\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez opens: \"Your Majesty, we are gathered to discuss a grave threat to Holy Mother Church. The Council of Basel has defied Pope Eugenius IV and claims authority above the Holy Father himself.\"\n\n\nBishop Álvaro de Isorna of Cuenca speaks immediately, his voice hard: \"Your Majesty, this is heresy masquerading as reform. These so-called conciliarists echo the Hussites—questioning legitimate authority, sowing discord, threatening the very structure Christ established when He gave the Keys to Peter.\"\n\n\nThe Bishop of León stands, angry: \"The Hussites have defeated five crusades! Five! They burn churches, murder priests, reject the sacraments—and now Basel negotiates with them as equals? This is madness! The Church militant should crush heresy, not debate it!\"\n\n\nSeveral bishops murmur agreement. The mood is hostile to Basel.\n\n\nBut then Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena of Burgos—the scholar—speaks more carefully: \"My brothers, we must distinguish between the Hussites' heretical teachings and Basel's legitimate concerns about church governance. The Council of Constance did establish precedent for conciliar authority during the Great Schism—\"\n\n\n\"An emergency measure!\" Bishop de Isorna interrupts. \"Not a permanent revolution in church government! The moment the schism ended, normal papal supremacy should have resumed!\"\n\n\nThe young Bishop of Palencia tries to interject: \"But surely reforms are needed—the sale of offices, the nepotism—\"\n\n\n\"Do you dare criticize the Holy Father?\" the Bishop of Ávila snaps. \"This is how heresy begins—questioning, doubting, undermining. Today Basel, tomorrow every diocese claims independence from Rome!\"\n\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez raises his hand for order. The room is clearly divided, but the conservatives vastly outnumber the few moderate voices.\n\n\nHow do you want to respond to this more accurately fractious and conservative gathering?"
