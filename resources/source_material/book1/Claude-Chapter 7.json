      "say": "Thought process: Strategized royal response to tense noble assembly confrontation.\n\nExcellent! The user wants to continue the story at a key moment - Juan is about to meet with the nobles of Seville to publicly confirm his arrest warrant for the Infantes de Aragón.\n\nLet me review the key context:\n- Juan has just returned to Seville (September 28)\n- He met with Granada's ambassador and firmly rejected the peace offer\n- The arrest attempt by Álvaro failed - Infantes refused and are now fortified\n- Kingdom is divided: 30% support Juan, 20% support Infantes, 50% neutral\n- Álvaro is waiting to report on the failed arrest\n- There's a noble assembly waiting where Juan must address the situation\n\nI should set up the scene for the noble meeting. This is a crucial political moment where Juan needs to:\n1. Confirm the arrest warrant publicly\n2. Maintain royal authority despite the failed arrest\n3. Rally support from neutral nobles\n4. Not appear weak but also not trigger civil war\n\nI need to:\n- Describe the setting and atmosphere\n- Show who's present (Álvaro, loyal nobles, neutral nobles, some sympathetic to Infantes)\n- Give Juan the floor to speak\n- Let him decide how to handle this delicate situation\n\nThe tone should be tense - everyone knows about the failed arrest, everyone is watching to see how the young king responds.\n\nI should keep this relatively brief since we're setting up a scene, and wait for the user to decide how Juan approaches this.\n\n\nThe Noble Assembly at the Alcázar\n\n\nSeville, September 28, 1430 - Evening\n\n\n\nThe great hall of Seville's Alcázar fills with nervous energy as nobles, church officials, and city representatives gather. Word spread quickly through the city: the King will address the matter of the Infantes tonight.\n\n\nThe Audience (~80 people assembled):\n\n\nRoyal Supporters (~25 nobles):\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stands near the throne, composed but showing strain from the failed arrest\n\nYour secret cabinet members scattered throughout: Juan de Daza, Diego Gómez de Sandoval, Lope de Barrientos, Íñigo López de Mendoza (younger), Rodrigo Manrique\n\nSeveral loyal noble houses from Andalusia\n\nBishop of Seville and clergy clearly on your side\n\n\nNeutral Observers (~45 nobles and officials):\n\n\nMasters of Calatrava and Alcántara (the Military Orders still uncommitted)\n\nRepresentatives from major cities: Burgos, Toledo, Córdoba\n\nMinor and middling nobility watching carefully\n\nMerchants and guild representatives\n\n\nInfantes Sympathizers (~10 nobles):\n\n\nSupporters who backed the failed rebellion\n\nLooking defiant but nervous\n\nMaster of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán) - the one Military Order supporting the Infantes\n\nA few northern nobles with Aragonese connections\n\n\nThe Atmosphere:\n\n\nTorches and candles illuminate faces showing worry, calculation, fear\n\nArmed guards at every entrance - both royal guards and private retinues\n\nEveryone knows about the failed arrest at Arévalo\n\nMany received letters from the Infantes claiming the arrest orders were \"unlawful persecution\"\n\nYour 62 white-clad crusaders are visible outside the hall, a new presence that draws many eyes\n\n\nYou sit on the throne with the papal bull in its sealed case beside you. The white banner with the True Cross and Santiago's bone stands behind you, clearly visible to all.\n\n\nÁlvaro steps forward and announces: \"His Majesty Juan II, by the grace of God King of Castile and León, will now address this assembly.\"\n\n\nThe hall falls silent. Every eye turns to you.\n\n\n\nHow do you wish to proceed, Your Majesty?\n\n\nYou could:\n\n\nGive a formal speech about royal authority and the Infantes' rebellion\n\nSpeak more informally, addressing specific concerns\n\nFocus on the crusade and papal backing as the main message\n\nConfront the Infantes' supporters directly\n\nAddress the failed arrest and what happens next\n\nSomething else entirely\n\n\nWhat do you say or do?"

      "say": "I am about to perform an action. My goal is to increase my support, to weaken the infantes influence and power.\n\n\nMy dear nobles, welcome and thank you for coming. Much has happened the last months and I understand you are eager to hear about my pilgrimage. I will recount all events in a moment but first, I want to adress the rebellion that is currently under way against the crown. The infantes must surrender themselves to face trial. This is well known and the longer they don't the longer uncertainty and instability in the realm continues. They will answer for the damage they have caused and their judgement shall be just and fair.\n\n\nThe infantes stand accused among other crimes of spreading misinformation about events and about my person. I regret that anyone may have believed these lies to be true, but I do not blame them. There is time for them to reaffirm their trust in me and my rule and I bear no ill will against anyone. I thank those who's faith in me has remained strong even during my absence. My fight is with the infantes alone and anyone helping or serving them rebels against not only me, the crown but also against the sacred charge I have recieved in Rome. I cannot fight Grenada while rebels are stabbing me in the back.\n\n\nNow, I will recount events starting with me installing a regency council to rule in my stead during my pilgrimage. As you know, I wanted to include the infantes in this and I entrusted them with half my council seats. I felt I was being more than fair to them, giving them a lot of influence. An opportunity to serve the realm. So I left, safe in the knowledge the realm was stable and secure in my absence.\n\n\nA few days into my journey I felt a special calling for the first time. A pull or feeling I should return home and retrieve my father's sword. I did not know it at the time, but this desicion was more important than I could even imagine. After much prayer, I sent my main party ahead and with a few guards I rode back home quickly and arrived just when the first council was taking place. I overheard the infantes already planting the seeds of rebellion by replacing key positions and even proposing a permanent council to effectively rule in my stead. The other two members of the council are present here today and they can as witnesses attest to these actions.\n\n\nI give both the bishop and Mendoza a chance to give their testimony.\n\n\nI immediately walked in and removed infante Juan from the council. Still wanting peace in my realm, I kept Enrique. A sign of trust that was again perhaps too naive. I dismissed Juan and threatened him if he refused. An action I regret, angry as I was and a sinner before God.\n\n\nI then left for Santiago where another feeling struck me. I felt certain I should travel all the way to holy Rome and petition the holy See to grant me a crusade against Grenada. It seemed folly at the time, my pilgrimage was not meant to go on for so long, but I again felt certain and I set off to Rome. Along the way I met many people and had many inspired and blessed persons, some of which wrote letters of recommendation, attesting to my faith and my sincerity.\n\n\nI give a chance for all letters to be read and passed around for inspection.\n\n\nWhen I arrived in Italy, I inspected my fathers sword carefully for the first time and read that it read \"Non nobis Domine\". Words that have come to mean so much to me and others. I started to feel more and more certain but there was still more to come.\n\n\nI pass around my sword so everyone can inspect it and read the inscription.\n\n\nWhen I arrived in Rome I met with Orsini and we discussed why I was in Rome and what I wanted. Later that night, a final feeling came over me. I felt so certain about what I should do next, but was also terrified. I tried to let my soul find comfort in the council of my confessor as I so often do but I was unable to bring into words what I was about to do. I have seldom felt so alone in my struggles before God my friends, especially since I knew what I was about to do and that I was absolutely going to do it. I will let witnesses describe what happened during my meeting with the holy father.\n\n\nI let witnesses describe events and I let the letter of Orsini be read and passed around.\n\n\nI then let the entire papal bull be read, including the passage that includes my actions during my audience with the pope, establishing what happened beyond any doubt hopefully.\n\n\nWith support I started my long journey back home. I raised my banner for the first time in Florance and then went on to Barcelona where I recieved much support and was able to see my dear sister again after many years. She is in good health and brings her greetings to this court, remembering her roots as a Castillian noble woman.\n\n\nThis brings me here with you today where we ask ourselves what to do next. Can I count on your support to face the challenges ahead?\n\n\nDetermine my chance for success using the standard method without describing the outcome yet."

      "say": "Thought process: Strategized papal-backed plan to isolate and weaken rebellious nobles.\n\nThis is a major action with multiple components:\n\n1. **Juan's stated goal**: Increase support, weaken Infantes' influence\n2. **His approach**: \n   - Firmly demand Infantes surrender for trial\n   - Frame them as rebels spreading misinformation\n   - Offer amnesty to their supporters (\"I bear no ill will\")\n   - Recount his journey with evidence and witnesses\n   - Emphasize divine guidance without claiming outright miracles\n   - Display physical evidence (letters, sword, papal bull)\n   - Personal testimony from credible witnesses\n   - Appeal for support\n\nLet me assess the probability factors:\n\n**FACTORS FAVORING SUCCESS:**\n\n1. **Physical Evidence**: He has overwhelming documentation\n   - Papal bull (official, sealed, authenticated)\n   - Letters from Archbishop of Zaragoza, Cardinal Orsini, others\n   - Father's sword with inscription\n   - Witnesses present who saw events\n\n2. **Papal Authority**: The crusade bull is the nuclear option\n   - Pope Martin V personally blessed him\n   - Church hierarchy present will recognize this authority\n   - Going against someone with a crusade bull risks excommunication\n   - This is the biggest advantage\n\n3. **The Infantes' Failed Rebellion**: They actually did try to seize power\n   - Archbishop of Toledo and Marquis de Santillana were on that council\n   - They can confirm the Infantes' plotting\n   - The Infantes refused lawful arrest orders\n   - They withdrew to fortresses - looks like guilt\n\n4. **Álvaro Successfully Defended**: Kingdom didn't collapse\n   - All major cities stayed loyal\n   - Royal administration intact\n   - This proves Juan's government was functioning\n\n5. **Narrative Control**: Juan controls the room right now\n   - He has the floor\n   - All evidence supports his version\n   - Infantes aren't present to defend themselves\n\n6. **Amnesty Offer**: \"I bear no ill will\" to supporters\n   - Gives neutrals and even some Infantes supporters an out\n   - Can switch sides without admitting guilt\n   - Politically smart\n\n7. **The 62 Crusaders**: Visible, disciplined force\n   - Shows he's building something real\n   - White tabards with red crosses distinctive\n   - Religious symbolism powerful\n\n8. **Religious Framing**: This isn't just politics anymore\n   - It's about a sacred crusade\n   - Opposing Juan means opposing the Pope's will\n   - Very powerful in medieval context\n\n**FACTORS AGAINST SUCCESS:**\n\nThe failed arrest attempt represents a significant challenge to Juan's credibility. This setback potentially undermines his political standing and reveals vulnerabilities in his initial strategy. The inability to execute a direct arrest suggests potential weaknesses in his political and military control, which could erode confidence among potential supporters.\n\nAlfonso V's military threat introduces substantial external pressure. This intervention by the Aragonese king creates a complex diplomatic landscape where potential allies might hesitate, fearing broader regional conflict. The threat of war could paralyze decision-making and fragment potential support for Juan's crusade.\n\nJuan's lack of an heir presents a critical succession problem. Nobles might view supporting him as a risky investment, potentially preferring alternative lineages that offer more stable long-term prospects. This uncertainty could significantly undermine his political capital and strategic positioning.\n\nThe economic and human costs of potential conflict weigh heavily on nobles' calculations. Many regional leaders benefit from existing arrangements and view a crusade as potentially destabilizing. Their self-interest prioritizes maintaining current power structures over embracing potentially disruptive military campaigns.\n\nReligious and cultural tensions add another layer of complexity. Juan's apparent tolerance, symbolized by diplomatic interactions with Muslim representatives, might alienate more conservative factions. These underlying cultural dynamics could create internal friction and challenge his broader political narrative.\n\nRegional differences further complicate Juan's strategic landscape. Northern nobles, with distinct priorities and interests, may remain detached from Granada-focused initiatives, revealing the fragmented nature of potential support. The papal bull's significance cannot be overstated in medieval European politics. Pope Martin V's personal endorsement of Juan, including the True Cross fragment and crusade commission, creates immense ecclesiastical pressure that's challenging to resist without severe religious consequences.\n\nThe failed arrest weakens Juan's position, yet his strategic response demonstrates political acumen. With compelling evidence from high-ranking witnesses like the Archbishop of Toledo and Marquis de Santillana, Juan effectively exposes the Infantes' plotting.\n\nHis amnesty offer provides a politically elegant escape route for wavering nobles. While self-interest and caution prevail, the combination of papal authority, physical evidence, and a face-saving diplomatic option tilts the probability of success in Juan's favor.\n\nThe narrative dynamics strongly favor Juan, despite the prestige damage from the unsuccessful arrest attempt. The papal blessing fundamentally reframes the conflict, making open opposition nearly untenable for most nobles.\n\nAnticipated outcomes suggest a moderate but meaningful shift: approximately 20-30% of neutral nobles might support Juan, gradually isolating the Infantes without guaranteeing total victory. The papal bull opens a strategic pathway to strengthening his Royal Council position.\n\n\nProbability Assessment: Noble Assembly Address\n\n\nYour Goal\n\n\nIncrease your support and weaken the Infantes' influence through this address\n\n\nFactors in Your Favor\n\n\nThe Papal Bull (Major Advantage):\n\n\nIn medieval Europe, papal authority is nearly absolute for the faithful\n\nA crusade bull with Pope Martin V's personal blessing is extraordinary\n\nOpposing someone commissioned by the Pope risks excommunication\n\nChurch hierarchy present will recognize this authority\n\nThis is your strongest card\n\n\nOverwhelming Evidence:\n\n\nPhysical documents: letters from Toulouse, Avignon, Orsini\n\nThe papal bull itself with authentication\n\nYour father's sword with its inscription\n\nWitnesses present who saw events\n\nArchbishop of Toledo and Marquis de Santillana can confirm the Infantes' plotting at that first council meeting\n\n\nThe Infantes Actually Did Rebel:\n\n\nThey seized fortresses (Arévalo and others)\n\nThey tried to rally nobles against you\n\nThey refused lawful arrest orders\n\nThey withdrew to fortified positions - behavior of guilty men\n\nThis isn't just accusation - it's documented fact\n\n\nYour Successful Absence:\n\n\nÁlvaro held the kingdom\n\nAll major cities stayed loyal\n\nRoyal administration intact\n\nProves your government functions without you\n\n\nSmart Political Framing:\n\n\nAmnesty offer (\"I bear no ill will\") gives neutrals and even some Infantes supporters an out\n\nThey can switch sides without admitting they were wrong\n\nSeparates the Infantes from their supporters\n\n\nVisible Military Force:\n\n\n62 crusaders in white tabards outside\n\nDistinctive, disciplined, religious symbolism\n\nShows you're building something real\n\n\nFactors Working Against You\n\n\nThe Failed Arrest (Major Problem):\n\n\nYou ordered their arrest, it failed publicly\n\nMakes you look weak - gave command that wasn't obeyed\n\nInfantes openly defied you and got away with it\n\nThis happened just weeks ago - still fresh\n\n\nAlfonso V's Threat:\n\n\nKing of Aragon threatened war if his brothers are harmed\n\nThat's a major external power\n\nMany nobles fear war with Aragon more than they want crusade\n\nSome prefer peace with Aragon over supporting you\n\n\nPractical Concerns:\n\n\nYou have no heir - if you die, Infantes or their line inherit anyway\n\nCrusade will cost money and lives\n\nMany frontier nobles profit from current Granada arrangement\n\nFighting both Infantes AND Granada simultaneously is impossible\n\nNobles know this\n\n\nNeutrals Are Neutral for Reasons:\n\n\nThey're waiting to see who wins\n\nSelf-interest, regional concerns, family ties\n\nNorthern nobles care more about Navarre/France than Granada\n\nNot everyone cares about completing the Reconquista\n\n\nThe Infantes' Counter-Narrative:\n\n\nThey've been sending letters claiming persecution\n\nPortraying arrest orders as \"unlawful\"\n\nSome nobles received these and might believe them\n\nThey're not present to defend themselves, but their version is out there\n\n\nMy Assessment\n\n\nThis action is LIKELY TO SUCCEED.\n\n\nThe papal bull is your trump card - in 1430, papal authority matters enormously. Combined with physical evidence, credible witnesses, the Infantes' actual rebellious actions, and your smart amnesty offer, you have a very strong case.\n\n\nHowever, it's not \"high probability\" because the failed arrest seriously damaged your prestige, Alfonso V's threat is real, and many nobles will remain cautious about practical concerns (succession, costs, military reality).\n\n\nIf you succeed: Expect a significant portion of neutrals (perhaps 20-30%) to shift toward supporting you. Some Infantes supporters might quietly abandon them. The Infantes become more isolated. You'll enter the November Royal Council from a stronger position.\n\n\nIf you fail: Neutrals stay neutral, the Infantes maintain their base, questions arise about whether papal backing matters if you can't actually arrest rebels. Could embolden opposition.\n\n\n\nPlease roll your dice and tell me the result: Great Success, Success, Failure, or Catastrophic Failure."

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed political speech's limited impact amid complex negotiations.\n\nThe player rolled a Failure (not catastrophic). This is for an action that was \"likely to succeed\" - so the failure should be meaningful but not devastating. \n\nThe papal bull is powerful, the evidence is strong, but something goes wrong. Let me think about what would realistically happen in a failure scenario:\n\n1. The speech is good, the evidence is compelling\n2. BUT the nobles don't shift their positions much\n3. The failed arrest looms too large\n4. Practical concerns outweigh religious authority for many\n5. People are impressed but not convinced enough to commit\n\nThis should be a \"respectful but uncommitted\" response. The nobles hear him, acknowledge the papal authority, but don't actually pledge support in meaningful numbers. Maybe a few shift, but not the significant movement Juan hoped for.\n\nThe failure should manifest as:\n- Polite acknowledgment but no concrete commitments\n- Questions about practical concerns\n- The elephant in the room: the failed arrest\n- Someone (probably a neutral) articulating the concerns everyone has\n- End result: Juan's position not stronger, neutrals stay neutral\n\nThis is a political failure - he made his case, but didn't move the needle much.\n\n\nThe Noble Assembly - A Respectful Resistance\n\n\nSeville, September 28, 1430 - Evening\n\n\n\nThe Testimonies\n\n\nArchbishop Juan Martínez de Contreras (Archbishop of Toledo) rises first when you invite him to testify. His voice is measured, careful:\n\n\n\"I bear witness to what His Majesty describes. At that first council meeting in May, I was present. Infante Juan did indeed propose... substantial changes to the regency structure. The young king's return was unexpected, and his removal of Infante Juan from the council was... within his royal prerogative.\"\n\n\nThe Archbishop sits. His testimony is technically supportive, but delivered with visible discomfort. He doesn't want to anger the Infantes or their powerful brother Alfonso V.\n\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza the Elder (Marquis de Santillana) stands next. A more forceful voice:\n\n\n\"The Infantes discussed making the regency permanent. I heard it with my own ears. They spoke of moderating His Majesty's 'enthusiasm' upon his return. The king's account is accurate.\"\n\n\nBetter. But Mendoza also adds: \"Though I must note - the younger Infante, Enrique, has served honorably on the regency council since. He is not his brother.\"\n\n\nThe Documents Circulate\n\n\nYour father's sword passes from hand to hand. Nobles examine the inscription: Non Nobis Domine. Some touch it reverently. Others study it skeptically, as if checking whether the words might be recently added.\n\n\nThe letters from Toulouse, Avignon, and Cardinal Orsini make their rounds. Nobles read them carefully. You see nods, impressed expressions. The Cardinal's letter describing your papal audience draws particular attention - Orsini is known throughout Europe, his words carry weight.\n\n\nThen the papal bull is read aloud.\n\n\nThe chamber falls utterly silent as the reader progresses through the Latin, translating key passages into Castilian. When he reaches the section describing your act before Pope Martin V - the complete renunciation, kneeling naked, the offering of everything - gasps and whispers ripple through the hall.\n\n\nSeveral clergy make the sign of the cross. Some nobles look genuinely moved.\n\n\nBut others exchange glances that say: Is this piety or madness?\n\n\nThe Response Begins\n\n\nWhen you finish your address and ask for their support, there is a long silence.\n\n\nThen the Master of Calatrava stands. He's a powerful man, head of one of the three great Military Orders, and crucially - he's been neutral throughout this crisis.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, no one here questions the authenticity of your papal bull. It is... extraordinary. The Pope's blessing upon you is clear. Your pilgrimage and its results are remarkable.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. The whole hall waits.\n\n\n\"But Your Majesty, we must speak of practical matters. You ordered the Infantes arrested for rebellion. This was your right as king. But...\" he chooses his words carefully, \"...the arrest failed. They refused to surrender. They withdrew to their fortresses. And King Alfonso of Aragon has made his position clear - any harm to his brothers means war.\"\n\n\nMurmurs of agreement ripple through the neutral faction.\n\n\n\"You ask if you can count on our support to face challenges ahead. But which challenge, Your Majesty? The crusade against Granada? Or civil war against the Infantes? Because we cannot fight both. We do not have the strength for both.\"\n\n\nA merchant representative from Burgos stands next, emboldened by the Master's frankness:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, the crusade will cost fortunes. Lives. Years of campaigning. Meanwhile, our trade with Granada is profitable. The tribute they pay enriches the treasury. Is it wise to destroy this arrangement for... for what? So we can spend decades bleeding ourselves against their mountain fortresses?\"\n\n\nThe Crucial Moment\n\n\nCount Fadrique Enríquez, a powerful Andalusian noble who has been loyal to the crown, rises. You expect support. Instead:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I believe your account of events. I believe the Infantes plotted against you. I believe the Pope blessed you. But...\"\n\n\nHe looks around the room, gathering courage to say what many are thinking.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, you have no heir. You are eighteen, unmarried, no children. If something happens to you - in battle, by illness, by accident - who inherits? The Infantes or their line. We would be fighting against our potential future kings.\"\n\n\n\"You ask us to commit to a crusade of years, perhaps decades. To help you arrest princes of Aragon. To risk war on two fronts. But you give us no security about succession, no promise of stability, no...\" he struggles for the word, \"...no certainty that this won't all collapse if you fall from a horse next month.\"\n\n\nThe silence that follows is crushing.\n\n\nThe Final Response\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna looks stricken. He steps forward to speak, but you see it in the room - the damage is done.\n\n\nOne by one, nobles begin to respond to your question. The pattern becomes clear:\n\n\nThe Already-Loyal (~25 nobles):\n\n\nPledge continued support\n\nBut with visible worry about the complications raised\n\nÁlvaro, your cabinet members, Bishop of Seville, loyal Andalusian houses\n\nThey were with you before; they're still with you\n\nBut they look concerned\n\n\nThe Neutrals (~45 nobles):\n\n\nExpress respect for papal authority\n\nAcknowledge the Infantes' rebellion\n\nBut make no concrete pledges\n\n\"We will watch how matters develop\"\n\n\"We must consult with our houses\"\n\n\"The crusade is a worthy goal, but the timing...\"\n\nThey applaud your piety but commit to nothing\n\n\nThe Infantes' Supporters (~10 nobles):\n\n\nMaster of Santiago speaks: \"Your Majesty, the Infantes deserve to face their accusers in person, not be arrested by your favorite.\" (He means Álvaro)\n\n\"They are princes of Aragon. This matter must be resolved diplomatically.\"\n\nThey're defiant but notably don't leave the hall\n\nEven they seem uncomfortable openly opposing a papal crusader\n\n\nThe Aftermath\n\n\nWhen the assembly concludes an hour later, you've gained perhaps three or four nobles who shift from neutral to supportive. Not nothing, but far from the decisive swing you hoped for.\n\n\nThe Master of Alcántara approaches you privately afterward: \"Your Majesty, I mean no disrespect. What you accomplished in Rome is extraordinary. But we need to see the Infantes dealt with before we commit to crusade. Show us you can handle rebels in Castile, then we'll follow you to Granada.\"\n\n\nJuan de Daza, your treasury official from the secret cabinet, whispers to you as nobles file out: \"Your Majesty, they believe everything you said. They just don't believe it matters. The failed arrest looms too large.\"\n\n\n\nStatus Update\n\n\nNoble Alignment (after the assembly):\n\n\nSupporting Crown: 32-35% (up from 30-35% - minimal gain)\n\nSupporting Infantes: 15-20% (unchanged)\n\nNeutral/Waiting: 50% (down slightly but still majority)\n\n\nThe Problem Identified:\n\n\nThe nobles heard your story. They believe it. They're impressed by the papal bull. But they're paralyzed by practical concerns:\n\n\nThe failed arrest makes you look weak\n\nAlfonso V's threat of war\n\nYour lack of an heir\n\nThe impossibility of fighting Infantes AND Granada simultaneously\n\nEconomic interests tied to current Granada arrangement\n\n\nÁlvaro's Assessment (in your private chambers afterward):\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, you gave them everything - miracles, papal blessing, physical proof. And they still won't move. This isn't about evidence. It's about fear. They're afraid to commit to either side until they see who will win.\"\n\n\nHe looks exhausted. \"The November Council is six weeks away. We need to give them something concrete before then. Not just spiritual authority - actual power. Either we break the Infantes somehow, or we make peace with them. We can't go to the Royal Council with this standoff unresolved.\"\n\n\n\nYour Majesty, the evening grows late. Your 62 crusaders wait outside, your relics are secure, but your political position has barely improved despite your best efforts.\n\n\nWhat do you wish to do next?"

Juan...\" He uses your name, which he rarely does even in private. \"You did everything right. Your speech was perfect. The evidence overwhelming. Any reasonable person would be convinced.\"\n\n\nHe sits heavily. \"But nobles aren't reasonable when they're afraid. And right now, they're terrified.\"\n\n\nHe drinks. \"You feel crushed. I understand. But you need to hear something: you've been gone four months. I've been here, watching this unfold. The Infantes' rebellion failing should have destroyed them. But instead, when you tried to arrest them and they refused, something shifted. Nobles started asking: 'If the King can't arrest rebels, what can he do?'\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"That's what we're fighting now. Not their loyalty to the Infantes - their doubt about your power to act.\"\n\n\nThe Marriage Question\n\n\nÁlvaro's expression shifts to something more calculating, more political. This is his strength.\n\n\n\"An heir. Yes. Immediately. You're eighteen - you should have been married two years ago. Your father's death and the regency chaos delayed it, but we can't wait longer.\"\n\n\nHe stands, pacing. \"Let me think through options...\"\n\n\n\"The Aragonese Alliance\":\n\"Alfonso V's wife is your sister María, but they have no children after fifteen years. He might be open to another connection. He has cousins - there's Leonor of Alburquerque, about your age, connected to the royal house. A marriage there would force Alfonso to choose: support his brothers in rebellion, or accept his new brother-in-law the King?\"\n\n\nÁlvaro pauses. \"But it looks like capitulation. Like you're begging Alfonso for peace by marrying into his family. The Infantes would see it as weakness.\"\n\n\n\"The Portuguese Option\":\n\"King João I has granddaughters. Portugal is wealthy, stable, focused on African exploration rather than Iberian politics. Clean alliance, no internal complications. Princess Isabel of Portugal is about your age, well-educated, by all accounts intelligent.\"\n\n\n\"Advantage: neutral. Doesn't strengthen one Castilian faction over another. Doesn't anger Aragon. Brings Portuguese gold and naval expertise.\"\n\n\n\"Disadvantage: doesn't solve your immediate Infantes problem. Doesn't give you powerful allies within Castile.\"\n\n\n\"Domestic Marriage\":\n\"Marry within Castile. Strengthen one of the major houses - Mendoza, Enríquez, Guzmán. Instantly win that entire faction's complete loyalty.\"\n\n\nHis face darkens. \"But alienate all the others. If you marry a Mendoza, the Enríquez and Guzmán families feel passed over. Creates as many enemies as allies.\"\n\n\n\"The French Connection\":\n\"Charles VII has connections. France is finally pushing England back - Joan of Arc changed everything last year. A French princess brings prestige, potential military alliance against Aragon if needed.\"\n\n\n\"But French at your court? That's... complicated. And France is still recovering from war.\"\n\n\nHe stops pacing. \"Your Majesty, I recommend Portugal. Fast, clean, neutral. We can negotiate it in weeks, marry you within three months. Have a pregnant queen by spring. It doesn't solve everything, but it removes one major concern the nobles raised tonight.\"\n\n\nHe hesitates. \"Though if you want to use marriage as a weapon - to force Alfonso's hand or win a major Castilian faction - Aragon or domestic would achieve that. Different strategies.\"\n\n\n\"What do you think, Your Majesty? Which path?\"\n\n\nThe Letter from Alfonso V\n\n\nÁlvaro retrieves a sealed letter from his desk. \"This arrived three weeks ago, shortly after the failed arrest. From Naples.\"\n\n\nHe breaks the seal and reads:\n\n\n\n\"To Our Dear Cousin Juan, King of Castile and León,\n\n\nWe write with deep concern regarding recent events in your realm. It has come to Our attention that you have ordered the arrest of Our beloved brothers, the Infantes Juan and Enrique, on charges of rebellion and treason.\n\n\nWe recognize your sovereignty within Castile and do not lightly interfere in your internal affairs. However, Our brothers are princes of the House of Aragon, sons of the late King Fernando I, and blood of Our blood.\n\n\nWe understand there have been disagreements and tensions. Politics often breeds such conflicts. But We strongly urge you to resolve this matter through negotiation and compromise rather than force.\n\n\nOur brothers have repeatedly expressed willingness to meet with you personally to address your concerns. They seek only fair hearing and proper justice, not persecution by your favorite.\n\n\nShould any harm come to Our brothers - through arrest, imprisonment, trial, or other means - We would view it as an attack upon Our royal house. We would be compelled to take measures to protect Our family's honor and safety.\n\n\nWe do not make threats lightly, cousin. We seek peace between our kingdoms. But We will not stand idle while Our brothers are hunted like common criminals.\n\n\nWe propose this solution: Call off the arrest orders. Invite Our brothers to the November Royal Council under guarantee of safe conduct. Let them answer charges publicly, before the assembled nobility, where all may witness justice. If they are guilty, let it be proven before witnesses. If they are innocent, let them be vindicated.\n\n\nWe await your response with hope that wisdom will prevail over rashness.\n\n\nWritten in Our city of Naples, this third day of September, in the year of Our Lord 1430,\n\n\nAlfonso, by the Grace of God King of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia, and Corsica, Count of Barcelona\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro sets the letter down. \"He's offering you an out. Safe conduct to the Royal Council, public hearing, formal trial. It's... actually not unreasonable.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you carefully. \"But notice what he's also doing. He's forcing your hand. If you refuse safe conduct and keep trying to arrest them, you're the unreasonable one. If you grant it, they show up to the Council as free men, not prisoners.\"\n\n\n\"And that phrase - 'persecution by your favorite.' He means me. Alfonso is playing the old game: blame the low-born advisor, not the king. Give the nobles someone to hate other than you.\"\n\n\n\"How do you want to respond to Alfonso? And do you want to grant the Infantes safe conduct to the November Council?\"\n\n\nPublic Display in Seville\n\n\nÁlvaro's face brightens slightly at this suggestion. \"Yes. Absolutely yes. What you did in Florence and Barcelona - we should do that here.\"\n\n\nHe pulls out parchment, making notes. \"The Cathedral of Seville is magnificent - larger than Barcelona's, rival to any in Christendom. We could display the banner and relics there. Multiple days, like Barcelona.\"\n\n\n\"But we need to think carefully about what worked before and what's different here:\"\n\n\nAdvantages in Seville:\n\n\nThis is YOUR city, your power base\n\nAndalusia cares more about Granada than Barcelona does - they live on the frontier\n\nThe cathedral clergy are loyal to you\n\nCommon people need to see what the nobles just saw\n\n\nChallenges:\n\n\nYou already spoke to the nobles tonight - impact might be lessened\n\nGranada's ambassadors just left - story will spread that Sultan offered peace and you rejected it\n\nSome might wonder: if crusade is so blessed, why did nobles not rally immediately?\n\n\n\"I recommend: Take a week. Do what you did in Barcelona - daily displays, let people touch the barriers near the relics, recruiting, fundraising. Build momentum from the bottom up. Show the nobles that common people support this crusade even if they're hesitant.\"\n\n\nHe grins slightly - the first time you've seen him smile all evening. \"And nothing makes nobles nervous like seeing common people passionate about something. They'll start worrying: 'What if the King doesn't need us? What if he builds this crusade from merchants and common soldiers?'\"\n\n\n\"Also - your 62 crusaders. They should be visible everywhere. Training in public squares. White tabards gleaming. People need to see this is real, not just talk.\"\n\n\nPractical questions:\n\n\n\"How long do you want to do this? A week? Two weeks? That brings us to mid-October, gives us three weeks before the Royal Council.\"\n\n\n\"Do you want to personally preach, like in Florence? Or let the clergy do it while you remain more... kingly?\"\n\n\n\"Should we start recruiting here? We'll get hundreds of applicants - we need Captain Fernán and your other officers to screen them properly.\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro refills both wine cups. \"Your Majesty, tonight was hard. But it's not over. We have six weeks until the Council. Let's use them.\"\n\n\n\"What are your priorities? Marriage negotiations? Response to Alfonso? Public crusade campaign? All three?\""

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed royal marriage dynamics through political power lens.\n\nThis is a good question that deserves a thoughtful answer. Let me think through why Álvaro framed it that way, and whether he's actually correct or perhaps overstating things.\n\nThe context:\n1. Juan just tried to arrest the Infantes and failed\n2. Alfonso V threatened war if his brothers are harmed\n3. The Infantes are currently in open defiance, holding fortresses\n4. Juan's authority was just questioned by the nobles because he couldn't enforce his arrest order\n\nÁlvaro's perspective would be that:\n- Juan is currently in a conflict with the Infantes (Aragonese princes)\n- Alfonso V just threatened him\n- If Juan now turns around and seeks a marriage alliance with Aragon, it looks like he's backing down\n- It would appear he's trying to solve through marriage what he couldn't solve through force\n- The timing matters enormously\n\nHowever, this might be Álvaro's bias showing through. He's:\n- Deeply hated by the Infantes\n- Personally targeted by Alfonso's letter (\"your favorite\")\n- Has been fighting to keep them at bay for months\n- Might be overstating the \"weakness\" angle because he personally doesn't want reconciliation with his enemies\n\nA more balanced view might be:\n- Historically, royal marriages after conflicts were common and seen as diplomacy, not weakness\n- It could actually be seen as STRONG - forcing Alfonso to choose between conflict and family alliance\n- The \"weakness\" framing might be Álvaro's personal interpretation\n\nI should have Álvaro explain his reasoning, but also acknowledge this is his interpretation and Juan might see it differently.\n\n\nÁlvaro Reconsiders\n\n\nRoyal Chambers, Late Evening\n\n\n\nÁlvaro pauses, wine cup halfway to his lips. He sets it down slowly.\n\n\n\"That's... actually a fair question, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nHe sits back, reconsidering. \"Let me think through this more carefully. Perhaps I'm letting my own position color my judgment.\"\n\n\nHe steeples his fingers. \"The 'weakness' framing comes from the timing and sequence of events:\"\n\n\n\"The Recent Context\":\n\n\n\"Three weeks ago, you ordered the Infantes arrested. They refused. You - or rather, I, acting on your orders - rode to Arévalo to enforce it. They defied us. Alfonso threatened war. We withdrew.\"\n\n\n\"Then tonight, you demanded they surrender for trial. The nobles saw them still not surrendering.\"\n\n\n\"So if tomorrow you begin negotiating a marriage alliance with Aragon... what's the story nobles will tell? 'The King tried force, it failed, so now he's seeking alliance through marriage because he couldn't win through strength.'\"\n\n\nHe holds up a hand. \"But you're right to question me. That's one interpretation. Here's another:\"\n\n\n\"The Alternative Interpretation\":\n\n\n\"A king who tries force first, then switches to diplomacy and marriage alliance - that could be seen as wise statecraft. Flexible. Pragmatic. 'He tested their strength, found the cost too high, so he's securing peace through bonds of blood instead.' That's not weakness - that's how kingdoms actually work.\"\n\n\n\"Medieval politics is full of marriages that followed conflicts. It's how wars end without more bloodshed.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"I think my concern is more specific: it's not that Aragonese marriage is inherently weak. It's that I am the one Alfonso and the Infantes hate most. In his letter, he calls me 'your favorite' - that's an insult. They blame me for the arrest attempt, not you.\"\n\n\n\"If you marry into Aragon, part of the price Alfonso will demand is... me. My removal. Or at least my reduction. They'll want to 'free you' from my influence. That's what I fear when I call it 'capitulation.'\"\n\n\n\"The Honest Assessment\":\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, let me be more precise. An Aragonese marriage alliance:\"\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\nForces Alfonso to choose between supporting rebellious brothers or his new kinsman\n\nMight genuinely end the crisis peacefully\n\nBrings Aragonese resources and legitimacy\n\nHistorical precedent - your own sister married Alfonso, after all\n\nCould be framed as strength: \"I defeated them politically, now I'm binding them through marriage\"\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\nAlfonso will demand concessions - likely including limits on my power\n\nThe Infantes might see it as validation: \"We resisted, and got what we wanted\"\n\nTiming makes it look reactive, even if it's strategic\n\nYour most loyal supporters (who hate the Infantes) might feel betrayed\n\n\nHe drinks. \"The truth? I'm biased. They've been trying to destroy me for years. I want to see them crushed, not accommodated. But you're the King, not me. If you think an Aragonese marriage solves more problems than it creates, then my personal feelings shouldn't matter.\"\n\n\n\"Perhaps the real question is: Do you want to reconcile with the Infantes and Aragon, or do you want to defeat them? Because marriage suggests the former, and crusade + arrests suggests the latter.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you seriously. \"You can't do both simultaneously. You need to choose a path.\"\n\n\n\n\"What do you actually want, Your Majesty? Peace with the Infantes through accommodation? Or victory over them through force? Because your strategy should follow from that answer.\""

      "say": "Thought process: Strategized Portuguese marriage to crush Infantes without external conflict.\n\nThis is a clear strategic question. Juan wants to defeat the Infantes, not reconcile. So he needs to analyze which marriage alliance would best help him do that.\n\nLet me think through this carefully:\n\n**Portuguese Marriage:**\n- Portugal is neutral in Castilian-Aragonese conflicts\n- Wealthy from African trade and exploration\n- Naval power (important for crusade and Mediterranean control)\n- Won't anger Aragon but also won't pressure them\n- Doesn't directly help defeat the Infantes militarily or politically\n- BUT: Removes succession concern, stabilizes kingdom, lets Juan focus on crushing rebellion\n\n**French Marriage:**\n- France is recovering from Hundred Years War but turning the tide\n- Charles VII has been winning since Joan of Arc\n- France and Aragon have complicated relationship - often rivals\n- French marriage could be seen as anti-Aragonese move\n- Might actually provoke Alfonso V into supporting his brothers more\n- BUT: French military alliance could deter Alfonso from intervening\n- French prestige and resources\n\nÁlvaro would think this through very carefully. He's a brilliant political operator. He would probably favor Portuguese because:\n1. It doesn't escalate with Aragon (which you need to avoid if fighting Infantes internally)\n2. Gives you resources without complications\n3. Lets you focus on internal enemies without external war\n4. Once you've crushed the Infantes, THEN you can worry about Aragon\n\nFrench might actually make things worse by giving Alfonso justification to intervene more actively.\n\nLet me write Álvaro's analysis.\n\n\nStrategic Marriage Analysis\n\n\nRoyal Chambers, Late Evening\n\n\n\nÁlvaro's eyes sharpen. This is the question he can answer with confidence. He leans forward, all traces of earlier uncertainty gone.\n\n\n\"To defeat them. Good. Then we think clearly.\"\n\n\nHe stands, begins pacing - this is how he thinks best.\n\n\n\"The Infantes' strength comes from three sources: their own resources, nobles who fear you more than them, and their brother Alfonso in Aragon. To defeat them, we need to eliminate these supports one by one. Marriage is one tool. Let me analyze:\"\n\n\nThe Portuguese Option\n\n\n\"Princess Isabel of Portugal - or another Portuguese match.\"\n\n\nHow It Helps You Defeat the Infantes:\n\n\n\"Portugal gives you what you need most: stability and neutrality.\"\n\n\n\"First: It removes the succession concern immediately. The nobles' biggest fear tonight was 'what if the King dies?' A pregnant Portuguese queen by spring means that question becomes moot. Nobles can commit to you knowing there's a future beyond you.\"\n\n\n\"Second: Portuguese gold. Their African trade is phenomenally wealthy. King João's treasury is overflowing. A Portuguese marriage brings dowry, trade access, loans if needed. Money is how you pay soldiers. Money is how you keep your crusaders fed while fighting internal enemies.\"\n\n\n\"Third: Portuguese naval power. They have the best ships and sailors in Christendom right now. If you're fighting the Infantes AND eventually Granada, you need to control the sea. Portuguese galleys could blockade Aragonese ports, protect your own coasts, support amphibious operations.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth, and most important: Portugal doesn't threaten Alfonso.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro stops pacing, makes sure you're following this point.\n\n\n\"Alfonso's threat of war is real. If you marry French, he sees it as hostile encirclement - France to the north, Castile in the middle, all aligned against him. He has justification to help his brothers, even invade. You'd be fighting a two-front war.\"\n\n\n\"But Portugal? They're to your west, focused on Atlantic and Africa. They have no territorial disputes with Aragon. Alfonso can't claim a Portuguese marriage is aimed at him. It's genuinely neutral.\"\n\n\n\"This lets you isolate the Infantes. You're not threatening Aragon itself - you're just dealing with internal rebels. Alfonso can save face by saying 'my brothers' quarrel with Castile is not Aragon's concern.' He can let them fall without losing honor.\"\n\n\nHow You Use Portuguese Marriage to Crush Them:\n\n\n\"Marry Portuguese princess. Secure succession. Use Portuguese gold to hire mercenaries - professional soldiers loyal to gold, not noble factions. Use Portuguese ships to cut off any maritime support the Infantes might get.\"\n\n\n\"Then you move against them with overwhelming force. Not Álvaro trying to arrest them with a few hundred men - YOU, the King, with a royal army. Siege their fortresses. Starve them out. Take them by force.\"\n\n\n\"Alfonso watches from Naples. He grumbles. He writes angry letters. But he doesn't invade because you haven't actually threatened him. You've just married Portuguese, which is your right. You're just arresting rebels, which is your duty.\"\n\n\nThe French Option\n\n\n\"A French princess - Charles VII has daughters and cousins available.\"\n\n\nHow It Might Help:\n\n\n\"France is powerful. They're finally beating England after ninety years of war. They have the largest army in Christendom. A French marriage means French military alliance.\"\n\n\n\"It sends a very clear message to Alfonso: 'I have friends who can fight you.' That might make him back down.\"\n\n\n\"French prestige is enormous. Being allied with France elevates Castile's status in European politics.\"\n\n\nBut Here's the Problem:\n\n\nÁlvaro's face darkens.\n\n\n\"Alfonso sees French marriage as an act of aggression. France and Aragon compete in Italy - Alfonso is in Naples right now trying to claim it, and France has interests there too. If you marry French, Alfonso interprets it as: 'Castile is joining France against Aragon.'\"\n\n\n\"That gives him justification to actively support his brothers. Even invade. He can say to his own nobles: 'Castile has allied with our enemies. We must defend ourselves.'\"\n\n\n\"You might get French military support eventually, but in the short term? You're fighting the Infantes while also preparing for possible Aragonese invasion. That's the nightmare scenario.\"\n\n\n\"Also, French at your court creates complications. Language barriers. Cultural differences. French nobles who come with the princess expecting influence. It's messier.\"\n\n\nThe Strategic Reality:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, here's the brutal truth: You cannot fight Aragon and the Infantes at the same time. You don't have the resources. The kingdom is divided. The crusade isn't even started yet.\"\n\n\n\"So your marriage choice must avoid provoking Alfonso while you deal with internal enemies. Once the Infantes are crushed, once the kingdom is unified, once the crusade is succeeding - then you can worry about Aragon. But not now.\"\n\n\n\"Portuguese marriage keeps Alfonso neutral or at least not actively hostile. French marriage might provoke him into intervention.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's Recommendation\n\n\nHe sits back down, meets your eyes directly.\n\n\n\"Portugal. Marry Portuguese. Here's the timeline I envision:\"\n\n\n\"October: Send ambassadors to Lisbon. Begin negotiations with King João I or his son Duarte. This can move quickly - both kingdoms want the alliance.\"\n\n\n\"November: Royal Council. You present crusade bull, award crusader clasps, show your strength. Announce Portuguese betrothal. Removes succession concern.\"\n\n\n\"December-January: Portuguese princess arrives with fleet, dowry, naval support. You marry.\"\n\n\n\"Spring 1431: Queen is pregnant, kingdom is stable, you have Portuguese gold in treasury.\"\n\n\n\"Summer 1431: You move against the Infantes with overwhelming force. Siege their fortresses properly. Take them by force or starve them into surrender.\"\n\n\n\"Alfonso complains but doesn't intervene - you haven't threatened him, you're just enforcing law against rebels.\"\n\n\n\"By end of 1431: Infantes are defeated, imprisoned, or dead. Kingdom is unified under your authority. Queen delivers heir. Then you launch crusade from position of strength.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"That's how you defeat them. Not through one dramatic gesture, but through systematic preparation. Portuguese marriage is a building block, not the whole edifice.\"\n\n\n\nHe pours more wine. \"Your Majesty, there's also a more subtle consideration. The nobles tonight worried about many things. Portuguese marriage addresses almost all of them:\"\n\n\nNo heir? Portuguese princess fixes that.\n\nCan't afford crusade? Portuguese dowry helps.\n\nToo young/inexperienced? Portuguese alliance gives you credibility.\n\nMight die fighting? Pregnant queen means succession secured.\n\n\n\"It's... boring. Practical. Not dramatic. But it's effective.\"\n\n\nHe grins slightly. \"Save the drama for defeating the Infantes and conquering Granada. Marriage should be the stable foundation you build on, not another gamble.\"\n\n\n\n\"Does this analysis make sense, Your Majesty? Or do you see advantages to French marriage I'm missing?\""

Portuguese marriage delegation - this is straightforward, I should describe Álvaro organizing this quickly and effectively.\n\n2. The Infantes at the November Council - this is more complex. The player is asking about granting safe conduct, then possibly imprisoning them anyway if found guilty. This raises important medieval legal/honor questions.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Safe conduct in medieval times was sacred - violating it was considered deeply dishonorable\n- If you grant safe conduct \"to be heard\" but then imprison them afterward, that's... technically not violating safe conduct if they're found guilty by formal process, BUT it's politically dangerous\n- Alfonso's letter said \"should any harm come to Our brothers\" - that's vague enough to include imprisonment\n- Medieval precedent: safe conduct usually means \"for the duration of the meeting and return journey\" - what happens AFTER is separate\n- But nobles would see imprisoning someone you granted safe conduct to as treacherous, even if technically legal\n\nI should have Álvaro walk through this carefully, explaining the risks and options. This is a crucial decision point.\n\n\nPlanning the Endgame\n\n\nRoyal Chambers, Late Evening\n\n\n\nPortuguese Marriage Negotiations\n\n\nÁlvaro nods decisively. \"Portugal it is. I'll have the delegation ready within three days.\"\n\n\nHe pulls out parchment and begins writing notes rapidly.\n\n\n\"I'll send a strong embassy - someone with gravitas who can negotiate quickly. Let me think... Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, the Admiral of Castile. He's respected, experienced in diplomacy, and the Mendoza name carries weight. Plus he has no connection to our internal conflicts - Portugal will see him as representing the crown, not a faction.\"\n\n\nHe continues writing. \"The delegation will include:\"\n\n\nAdmiral Diego Hurtado de Mendoza (chief negotiator)\n\nBishop of Palencia (adds Church authority)\n\nJuan de Daza from your cabinet (he understands finances for dowry negotiations)\n\nAppropriate retinue and gifts\n\n\n\"We'll send letters ahead by fast rider announcing their coming. King João is old - 73 now - but still sharp. More likely we'll negotiate with his son Duarte, who's effectively running things. Duarte is cautious, methodical, but he wants this alliance. Portugal fears being isolated between Castile and the sea.\"\n\n\nThe Offer:\n\n\n\"We'll propose: Princess Isabel of Portugal. She's about fifteen or sixteen, which is perfect age for marriage. Well-educated by all accounts. King João's granddaughter through his son João, which makes her legitimate line.\"\n\n\n\"Alternative: Princess Leonor, Duarte's daughter, but she's only about six. Too young. Isabel is the logical choice.\"\n\n\nExpected Terms:\n\n\n\"Dowry: I'd expect 50,000-80,000 gold dobras (roughly equivalent to 150,000-200,000 florins). Portugal is wealthy, they can afford it.\"\n\n\n\"Naval support: We should request Portuguese galleys as part of the arrangement - perhaps a squadron of 10-15 ships for 'mutual defense.'\"\n\n\n\"Trade agreements: Favorable terms for Castilian merchants in Portuguese ports, vice versa.\"\n\n\n\"Military alliance: Standard defensive pact - if either kingdom is attacked, the other provides aid.\"\n\n\nTimeline:\n\n\n\"The delegation leaves in three days - October 1st. Fast sailing to Lisbon, maybe five days if weather cooperates. Negotiations could take two weeks if both sides are motivated. That brings us to mid-October.\"\n\n\n\"If successful, we announce betrothal at November 8th Council. Princess Isabel could arrive in Castile by December with proper escort and ceremony. Marriage in January.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro looks satisfied. \"It's tight, but doable. King João wants this alliance - he's been cautious about Castilian internal politics, but a stable marriage solves that. Duarte will see the advantages.\"\n\n\n\"I'll draft the formal letters tonight. You should sign them tomorrow after reviewing.\"\n\n\n\nThe Infantes and Safe Conduct - The Dangerous Game\n\n\nÁlvaro's expression becomes very serious. He sets down his quill.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, this is where we must be extremely careful. You're asking about the most delicate point of medieval law and honor: safe conduct.\"\n\n\nHe stands, pacing again. \"Let me explain the problem clearly:\"\n\n\nThe Safe Conduct Dilemma\n\n\n\"If you grant the Infantes safe conduct to attend the November Council, here's what that means legally and traditionally:\"\n\n\n\"Safe conduct guarantees:\"\n\n\nSafe travel TO the Council\n\nSafety DURING the Council\n\nSafe travel AWAY from the Council\n\n\n\"It does NOT necessarily protect them from consequences AFTER the Council concludes and they've safely departed.\"\n\n\n\"But here's the problem: If you grant them safe conduct, hear their case, declare them guilty, and then try to imprison them before they leave - that is technically not violating safe conduct IF you frame it as 'the Council has determined guilt and rendered judgment.' But...\"\n\n\nHe looks at you intently.\n\n\n\"Every noble in Christendom would see it as treachery. Breaking the spirit if not the letter of safe conduct. You would be called oath-breaker, deceiver, tyrant. It would destroy your reputation for honor.\"\n\n\n\"Medieval politics runs on trust in these formal guarantees. If kings can't be trusted to honor safe conduct, then no negotiation is possible, no assembly is safe, no peace can be made. You'd be seen as worse than the Infantes.\"\n\n\nAlfonso's Position\n\n\n\"Alfonso's letter is deliberately vague: 'should any harm come to Our brothers.' That's intentionally broad.\"\n\n\n\"He hasn't explicitly said 'imprisonment means war.' He's said 'harm' - which could mean execution, torture, imprisonment, or even just humiliation. He's leaving himself room to interpret events however suits his purposes.\"\n\n\n\"My assessment: If you imprison them after granting safe conduct, Alfonso will call it treachery and use it as justification for intervention. He might not immediately invade, but he'd have the moral high ground - 'my brothers were invited under guarantee of safety and then seized!' - and could rally support.\"\n\n\nYour Options\n\n\nÁlvaro counts them on his fingers:\n\n\nOption 1: Grant True Safe Conduct\n\n\n\"Invite them to Council with genuine safe conduct. They come, they speak, the nobles hear both sides. Then they leave safely.\"\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\nHonorable, builds your reputation for keeping oaths\n\nAlfonso can't object\n\nNeutrals might appreciate your fairness\n\nYou control the narrative - expose their rebellion publicly before witnesses\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\nThey walk away free afterward\n\nThey use the platform to spread their version of events\n\nMakes you look weak - 'he accuses them of rebellion but lets them leave?'\n\n\nWhat Happens After:\n\"They return to their fortresses. But you've publicly condemned them before all nobility. Then, weeks or months later, you move against them with force - but now with the Council's judgment backing you. 'I gave them chance to answer charges. They were found guilty. Now justice proceeds.'\"\n\n\n\"Alfonso can't easily object - his brothers got their public hearing, were found guilty by assembly of Castilian nobles, and THEN were pursued. That's legitimate legal process.\"\n\n\n\nOption 2: No Safe Conduct - They Come At Their Own Risk\n\n\n\"Invite them to Council without guaranteeing safety. Make clear: 'You are summoned to answer charges. If you come, you may be arrested.'\"\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\nLegally clean - you made no promises\n\nIf they come anyway and you arrest them, you broke no oath\n\nShows strength - 'I will not negotiate with rebels'\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\nThey won't come (obviously)\n\nLooks like you're afraid of public debate\n\nThey can claim 'we wanted to answer charges but the King refused safe conduct'\n\nAlfonso can say 'my brothers sought justice but were denied fair hearing'\n\n\n\nOption 3: The Trap (Grant Safe Conduct, Violate It)\n\n\n\"Grant safe conduct, they come, you arrest them anyway.\"\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\nYou get them in custody\n\nImmediate problem solved\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\nDevastating to your honor and reputation\n\nAlfonso has perfect justification for war\n\nEvery neutral noble turns against you\n\nYou're seen as oath-breaker forever\n\nMakes everything you said about the Infantes' treachery sound hypocritical\n\nUndermines your entire papal crusader image\n\n\nÁlvaro's face is grim. \"Your Majesty, I would never recommend this. The short-term gain isn't worth the permanent damage.\"\n\n\n\nOption 4: Conditional Safe Conduct\n\n\n\"This is creative, but risky. You could offer: 'Safe conduct to attend the Council and present your case. If the assembled nobles find you innocent, you leave freely. If found guilty, you submit to judgment.'\"\n\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\nPuts the decision on the nobles, not just you\n\nTheoretically fair - trial by peers\n\nDoesn't technically violate safe conduct because the condition was stated upfront\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n\nThey won't accept it - why would they?\n\nStill seen as a trap\n\nAlfonso can say 'you offered them show trial, not justice'\n\n\n\nÁlvaro's Recommendation\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, here's what I think you should do:\"\n\n\n\"Grant them genuine safe conduct to the November Council. Let them come, let them speak, let them leave safely.\"\n\n\n\"Why? Several reasons:\"\n\n\n\"First: You look honorable, strong, confident. 'I'm so certain of my case that I'll let them make theirs, face to face, before all the nobility.'\"\n\n\n\"Second: You control the venue. It's in Seville, your stronghold. You have the papal bull, the relics, the physical evidence. You have witnesses. You'll destroy them rhetorically.\"\n\n\n\"Third: The nobles get to see both sides and make their judgment. When they side with you (and they will, seeing the evidence), it's not just the King condemning rebels - it's the assembled nobility of Castile condemning them.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth: After the Council, after they've left safely... THEN you move. But now you have the Council's judgment. Now you have nobles committed to supporting you. Now Alfonso can't claim they were denied justice.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"Think of the November Council not as the moment you arrest them, but as the moment you break their political support completely. After that, arresting them becomes easier because they're isolated.\"\n\n\n\"Let them walk out of Seville on November 9th thinking they survived. Then in December, when you've married Portuguese, when nobles are committed, when you have resources - you strike. Properly. With overwhelming force.\"\n\n\n\nTimeline Álvaro Envisions:\n\n\nNovember 8: Council. Safe conduct. Public hearing. They're condemned by nobles but leave safely.\n\nDecember-January: Portuguese marriage. Secure succession. Build forces.\n\nFebruary-March 1431: Move against Infantes with royal army. Siege fortresses. Cut off support.\n\nSpring 1431: They surrender or are taken by force. Formal trial. Execution or life imprisonment.\n\nAlfonso's Response: He complains but doesn't invade - they got their hearing, were judged guilty by Castilian nobles, legal process was followed.\n\n\n\nÁlvaro refills his wine cup, hands shaking slightly. \"Your Majesty, I hate this. I hate that we have to give them safe conduct. I hate that they'll stand in front of you and lie. But strategically, it's the path that destroys them without destroying you.\"\n\n\n\"The question is: can you stand there in November, hear them accuse you and me, watch them walk away free... and trust that justice will come later? Because that requires patience. And patience is hard.\"\n\n\n\n\"What do you think, Your Majesty? Does this analysis make sense? Or am I being too cautious?\""

      "say": "Thought process: Calculated nobles' likelihood of condemning Infantes at council.\n\nThis is a great question. The user is asking about the realistic probability that the assembled nobles at the November Council would actually formally condemn the Infantes as guilty of rebellion, assuming Juan grants them safe conduct to attend and present their defense.\n\nLet me think through the factors:\n\n**Evidence Against the Infantes (Strong):**\n- They seized fortresses (Arévalo and two others) - this is undeniable\n- They tried to rally nobles against Juan during his absence\n- They attempted to make the regency permanent (witnessed by Archbishop and Mendoza)\n- They refused lawful arrest orders\n- They withdrew to fortified positions when arrest was attempted\n- All of this is documented and has witnesses\n\n**Evidence/Arguments the Infantes Will Present:**\n- They were legitimately appointed to regency council\n- They were \"protecting\" the realm while king was absent\n- Arrest orders came from Álvaro (the hated favorite), not directly from king\n- They claim they want to speak to Juan personally, not submit to Álvaro\n- They're princes of Aragon - should be treated with dignity\n- They might argue their actions were within bounds of regency authority\n- They'll claim they're being persecuted by Álvaro who monopolizes king's ear\n\n**Political Reality of Medieval \"Trials\":**\n- These assemblies aren't modern courts with juries and clear procedures\n- They're political gatherings where powerful men voice opinions\n- There's no formal \"guilty/not guilty\" vote usually\n- It's more about building consensus, showing support\n- Nobles won't want to definitively condemn princes of Aragon if it means war\n- Many nobles benefit from ambiguity - they can stay neutral\n\n**What \"Finding Them Guilty\" Actually Means:**\n- In medieval context, this likely means: the assembled nobles generally agree the Infantes acted improperly and the king has grounds to pursue justice\n- NOT: a formal legal verdict that all nobles sign off on\n- More like: enough nobles publicly condemn them that their legitimacy is destroyed\n\n\n- 30-35% support Juan\n- 15-20% support Infantes\n- 50-55% neutral/waiting\n\nThe political landscape is precarious. The neutral nobles hold the key to the Infantes' fate. Their decision will hinge on carefully weighing potential consequences. The threat of conflict, the strength of evidence, and the potential political repercussions will drive their judgment. Each noble will calculate their own advantage, balancing loyalty, risk, and potential reward in this delicate political moment.\n\nNobles are likely to choose a path of minimal disruption. They'll seek a resolution that avoids direct confrontation while preserving their own political standing. The most probable outcome is a carefully worded, ambiguous response that neither fully condemns nor fully supports the Infantes, leaving room for future political maneuvering.\n\nThe potential scenarios range from a weak, noncommittal statement to a more decisive but still politically cautious condemnation. Most will prioritize avoiding open conflict, protecting their own interests, and maintaining flexibility in an uncertain political environment.\n\nJuan can expect partial support - enough to claim some legitimacy, but not enough to guarantee immediate, decisive action against the Infantes. The political landscape suggests a compromise solution that allows nobles to appear principled while avoiding significant personal risk.\n\n\nÁlvaro's Honest Assessment\n\n\nRoyal Chambers, Late Evening\n\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down his wine cup and considers your question carefully. He's silent for a long moment.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, that's the crucial question, isn't it? Let me be completely honest with you about what's realistic.\"\n\n\nHe stands, begins pacing with his hands behind his back - his thinking posture.\n\n\nThe Evidence vs. The Politics\n\n\n\"The Evidence: It's overwhelming. They seized fortresses while you were gone. They tried to rally nobles against you. The Archbishop and Marquis de Santillana witnessed them plotting to make the regency permanent. They refused lawful arrest. All undeniable facts.\"\n\n\n\"In any normal court, with any normal defendants? Guilty. Clearly. No question.\"\n\n\n\"But...\"\n\n\nHe turns to face you.\n\n\n\"The Politics: These aren't normal defendants. They're princes of Aragon. Their brother is a king threatening war. And your 'jury' isn't impartial magistrates - it's nobles who care more about their own survival than abstract justice.\"\n\n\nWhat \"Guilty\" Actually Means\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, let me explain how these assemblies actually work, because it's not like a Church court or even a royal trial.\"\n\n\n\"There won't be a formal vote where each noble stands and declares 'guilty' or 'innocent.' Medieval councils don't work that way. Instead, it's more... organic. Messy.\"\n\n\n\"What happens is:\"\n\n\n\"You present your case\"\n\n\"The Infantes present theirs\"\n\n\"Nobles discuss, debate, argue amongst themselves\"\n\n\"Some speak publicly supporting one side or the other\"\n\n\"Eventually a consensus emerges - or doesn't\"\n\n\n\"So when I talk about 'finding them guilty,' I mean: Do enough nobles publicly agree that the Infantes rebelled and you have grounds to act against them?\"\n\n\nThe Realistic Outcomes\n\n\nÁlvaro holds up his hand, counting on fingers:\n\n\n\"Outcome One - Clear, Overwhelming Condemnation\"\n\n\n\"Nearly all nobles agree: 'Yes, the Infantes rebelled. The evidence is undeniable. The King has every right to arrest them and prosecute fully.' They pledge active support for moving against the Infantes by force if necessary.\"\n\n\nHe shakes his head. \"Probability: Low. Maybe 20-25%.\"\n\n\n\"Why? Because even nobles who believe they're guilty don't want war with Aragon. They'll be reluctant to formally condemn princes whose brother threatens invasion. They'll look for ways to acknowledge wrongdoing without demanding maximum punishment.\"\n\n\n\n\"Outcome Two - Majority Condemnation With Significant Ambiguity\"\n\n\n\"Most nobles, including many from the neutral faction, agree the Infantes acted 'inappropriately' or 'beyond their authority.' General consensus that you have grounds to pursue justice. But significant minority either defends them, stays silent, or urges 'compromise' and 'reconciliation.'\"\n\n\n\"Probability: Moderate to High. Maybe 50-60%.\"\n\n\n\"This is what I actually expect. The evidence is too strong to ignore completely, but fear of consequences prevents decisive action. You'd get statements like:\"\n\n\nHe affects a noble's voice: \"'Clearly there were... irregularities during His Majesty's absence. Perhaps the Infantes exceeded their mandate. But they are princes of royal blood. Surely this can be resolved through negotiation rather than force?'\"\n\n\n\"It's enough to damage the Infantes politically. It establishes you were wronged. But it doesn't give you the overwhelming mandate to crush them.\"\n\n\n\n\"Outcome Three - No Clear Consensus\"\n\n\n\"The assembly splits. Some defend you, some defend them, most stay silent or waffle. No clear judgment emerges. Lots of 'both sides make valid points' and 'we need more time to consider' and 'perhaps a mediation committee...'\"\n\n\n\"Probability: Moderate. Maybe 25-30%.\"\n\n\n\"This happens if the Infantes present their case effectively and Alfonso's threat looms large enough that nobles are paralyzed by fear.\"\n\n\n\n\"Outcome Four - They're Vindicated\"\n\n\n\"Nobles side with the Infantes against you.\"\n\n\n\"Probability: Very Low. Under 5%.\"\n\n\n\"The evidence is too strong. Even their supporters would struggle to claim they did nothing wrong. Your papal bull carries too much weight.\"\n\n\nThe Infantes' Defense Strategy\n\n\nÁlvaro sits back down, leans forward intently.\n\n\n\"Here's what they'll argue, because I know how they think:\"\n\n\n\"'We were appointed to the regency council by the King himself' - True. You did appoint them.\"\n\n\n\"'We acted to preserve stability while His Majesty pursued... spiritual matters' - They'll frame your pilgrimage as abandonment, themselves as responsible stewards.\"\n\n\n\"'We never rebelled against the King - we defended the realm against his favorite' - They'll blame me. Say everything was directed at removing my 'undue influence,' not opposing you.\"\n\n\n\"'We repeatedly offered to meet His Majesty personally to resolve this' - This is actually in Alfonso's letter. They'll claim you refused reasonable dialogue.\"\n\n\n\"'The arrest attempt was unlawful - ordered by Álvaro, not the King directly' - They'll argue the chain of command was questionable.\"\n\n\n\"'We are princes of Aragon, entitled to certain dignities' - Appeal to their status.\"\n\n\n\"'Taking fortresses was defensive, not aggressive - we feared persecution' - Frame it as self-protection.\"\n\n\n\"'Everything we did was within our regency authority' - Legal argument that the regency council gave them legitimate power.\"\n\n\nIt's sophisticated. It has enough truth mixed with lies to create doubt.\n\n\nThe Neutrals' Perspective\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, the 50% who are neutral? Here's what they're thinking:\"\n\n\nHe affects different voices, like an actor:\n\n\n\"'The Infantes clearly overstepped. But civil war would be worse than letting them save face...'\"\n\n\n\"'The King has papal backing - impressive! But the Infantes have Alfonso. Do we want Aragonese armies in Castile?'\"\n\n\n\"'Both sides probably have valid grievances. Maybe they can negotiate a settlement?'\"\n\n\n\"'I don't want to commit to either side until I see who's stronger...'\"\n\n\n\"'If I condemn the Infantes and they win somehow, I'm ruined. Better to hedge...'\"\n\n\n\"These are pragmatic calculations, not moral judgments. They know the Infantes rebelled. But knowing and acting on that knowledge are different things.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's Bottom Line\n\n\n\"So here's my honest assessment, Your Majesty:\"\n\n\n\"If you grant them safe conduct and hold the public hearing at the November Council:\"\n\n\n\"You will almost certainly get some formal condemnation - probably 60-70% of nobles agreeing they acted improperly and you have grounds to pursue justice.\"\n\n\n\"You will probably NOT get overwhelming, unanimous condemnation - many nobles will equivocate, urge compromise, or stay silent out of fear.\"\n\n\n\"What this actually gives you:\"\n\n\n\"Political cover to act later. You can say: 'The assembled nobility of Castile heard both sides and agreed the Infantes exceeded their authority. Justice must proceed.' That's legitimate.\"\n\n\n\"Damaged Infantes credibility. Even their supporters will have trouble defending the indefensible evidence. Some will quietly abandon them.\"\n\n\n\"Moral high ground. You gave them fair hearing, they were found wanting. Alfonso can't easily claim they were denied justice.\"\n\n\n\"What it does NOT give you:\"\n\n\n\"Immediate authorization to arrest them on the spot. Most nobles will resist that - they'll want 'more time,' 'negotiation,' 'peaceful resolution.'\"\n\n\n\"Unified noble support for military action. Many will still hope you'll find a way to avoid civil war.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you seriously. \"It's a victory, but not a decisive one. It weakens them significantly without destroying them outright. Then you have to finish the job afterward.\"\n\n\nThe Alternative Calculation\n\n\n\"Of course, there's another consideration: What happens if you DON'T grant safe conduct?\"\n\n\n\"If you refuse to let them attend, or refuse to guarantee their safety:\"\n\n\n\"They don't come. They stay in their fortresses. You can't formally try them in absentia - that looks like show trial. Alfonso has perfect excuse: 'My brothers wanted justice but were denied fair hearing.'\"\n\n\n\"Actually finding them 'guilty' becomes much harder because they're not there to answer charges. Nobles will say 'how can we judge without hearing their side?'\"\n\n\n\"You lose the moral high ground entirely.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro spreads his hands. \"So the calculation is:\"\n\n\n\"With safe conduct: 60-70% chance of significant (if not overwhelming) condemnation. Political victory that weakens them. They walk away but damaged.\"\n\n\n\"Without safe conduct: Maybe 30-40% chance of any meaningful condemnation. Looks like you're afraid of debate. They stay strong in their narrative.\"\n\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"Your Majesty, I think granting safe conduct and getting partial condemnation is better than refusing it and getting nothing. The partial condemnation is enough to work with. You build on it afterward.\"\n\n\n\"But I won't lie to you: you're not going to get the clean, decisive 'GUILTY - arrest them immediately' verdict you might want. Medieval politics doesn't work that way. It's messier. More gradual.\"\n\n\n\"Does this change your thinking about the safe conduct question?\""

      "say": "Thought process: Strategized diplomatic solution linking Alfonso's Italian and familial interests.\n\nThis is actually a brilliant political insight from the player. Let me think through this carefully:\n\n1. Alfonso V is indeed focused on Naples and Italian ambitions - this is historically accurate for 1430\n2. Castile could theoretically offer support - troops, money, diplomatic backing, naval support\n3. This creates a mutual interest: Alfonso gets help with what he actually cares about (Italy), Juan gets Alfonso to stop protecting his brothers\n4. The logic is sound: \"You want Naples? I can help. But not while fighting your brothers who are rebelling against me.\"\n\nThis is the kind of creative diplomatic solution that could work. Let me have Álvaro analyze it properly:\n\nAdvantages:\n- Addresses Alfonso's actual interests (Italy) rather than just the Infantes\n- Creates positive incentive rather than just threats\n- Potentially isolates the Infantes (Alfonso might sacrifice them for Italian gains)\n- Could lead to genuine alliance between Castile and Aragon\n- Historically plausible - kingdoms did this kind of horse-trading all the time\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Commits Castilian resources to Italian adventures\n- Might anger France (who also has Italian ambitions)\n- Could be seen as weakness (\"bribing\" Alfonso to stop protecting his brothers)\n- No guarantee Alfonso accepts - family loyalty is strong\n- The Infantes might see it as betrayal by their own brother and become more desperate\n\nThis is actually a sophisticated approach that Álvaro should appreciate. It's thinking like a real medieval diplomat. Let me have him analyze it enthusiastically but also point out the complexities and risks.\n\nThe probability of this working would depend on:\n- How much Alfonso values Italy vs. his brothers\n- What exactly Castile can offer\n- How the offer is framed\n- Timing and circumstances\n\nThis should probably be presented as \"likely to succeed\" or \"moderate probability\" - it's a good idea but not guaranteed. Alfonso does care more about Italy than his brothers, historically, but family loyalty is still a real factor.\n\n\nA Diplomatic Masterstroke?\n\n\nRoyal Chambers, Late Evening\n\n\n\nÁlvaro stops mid-pace. He turns to look at you, and for the first time tonight, you see genuine excitement flash across his face.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty... that's actually brilliant.\"\n\n\nHe sits down quickly, pulling parchment toward him, mind racing. \"I've been thinking about this all wrong. I've been treating Alfonso as an obstacle to overcome. But you're right - he's a potential ally with interests we can address.\"\n\n\nHe starts writing notes rapidly. \"Let me think this through carefully, because this could change everything.\"\n\n\nAlfonso's Italian Ambitions\n\n\n\"Alfonso V has been obsessed with Italy for years. He's in Naples right now trying to secure his claim. Here's the situation:\"\n\n\nThe Neapolitan Succession:\n\"Queen Joanna II of Naples is old, childless, dying. She's adopted Alfonso as her heir, then revoked it, then maybe adopted him again - the whole thing is a mess. There are other claimants: the Angevins from France, local Italian nobles, the Pope has opinions...\"\n\n\n\"Alfonso wants Naples desperately. It's wealthy, strategic, prestigious. It would make Aragon a true Mediterranean power. But it's expensive, complicated, and he's facing opposition from multiple directions.\"\n\n\nWhat Alfonso Needs:\n\n\nMilitary forces (troops for Italian campaigns)\n\nMoney (wars in Italy are phenomenally expensive)\n\nNaval support (controlling the Mediterranean)\n\nDiplomatic legitimacy (other kingdoms recognizing his claim)\n\nStability at home (can't fight in Italy if Iberia is unstable)\n\n\nÁlvaro looks up at you. \"And you're absolutely right - the Infantes problem hurts his Italian ambitions. Every soldier Alfonso worries about sending to protect his brothers in Castile is a soldier he can't send to Naples. Every florin spent on Iberian politics is a florin not spent on Italian wars.\"\n\n\nThe Diplomatic Offer - Strategic Framework\n\n\nÁlvaro leans forward, excited now.\n\n\n\"Here's how we could frame this to Alfonso:\"\n\n\nThe Core Proposal:\n\n\n\"A formal alliance between Castile and Aragon focused on supporting Alfonso's Italian ambitions, IN EXCHANGE for Alfonso withdrawing protection from his brothers and allowing Castilian internal justice to proceed.\"\n\n\nSpecifically, Castile Could Offer:\n\n\n\"Military Support:\n\n\n2,000-3,000 Castilian troops for Italian campaigns\n\nAfter we've secured our own kingdom, of course\n\nProfessional soldiers, well-equipped\n\nUnder Aragonese command but paid by Castile\n\n\n\"Naval Support:\n\n\nCastilian galleys to support Aragonese Mediterranean operations\n\nCombined fleet would dominate the sea\n\nCritical for controlling Italian coastal cities\n\n\n\"Financial Support:\n\n\nSubsidies for Italian wars - perhaps 50,000-100,000 florins over several years\n\nNot immediately, but once crusade taxation begins\n\nOr a share of Granada's wealth once conquered\n\n\n\"Diplomatic Support:\n\n\nCastile formally recognizes Alfonso's claim to Naples\n\nCastile uses diplomatic channels to support him with Pope, other kingdoms\n\nYour papal connections could be valuable here\n\n\n\"Marriage Alliance (we discussed this earlier):\n\n\nCould strengthen this further if needed\n\nBut might not even be necessary if the other incentives work\n\n\nThe Framing That Makes It Work\n\n\nÁlvaro stands, pacing again, but with energy now rather than worry.\n\n\n\"The key is how we present this to Alfonso. Not as 'stop protecting your brothers or else,' but as 'let's align our kingdoms' interests.'\"\n\n\nThe Pitch:\n\n\n\"'Your Majesty of Aragon,\n\n\nYou seek to establish your dynasty in Naples and secure Aragonese dominance in the Mediterranean. We seek to complete the Reconquista and unify the Iberian peninsula under Christian rule. These goals are complementary, not contradictory.\n\n\nBut internal divisions in Castile weaken both kingdoms. Your brothers' conflict with our crown drains resources, creates instability, and distracts from our shared strategic interests.\n\n\nWe propose: Let Castilian internal matters be resolved according to Castilian law. In exchange, Castile commits substantial support to your Italian ambitions - troops, ships, money, diplomatic backing.\n\n\nA unified Castile, securely under our rule, allied with Aragon in pursuit of Mediterranean dominance - this serves your interests far better than a divided Castile where your brothers maintain uncertain power.\n\n\nYour brothers acted against our crown. This must be addressed. But your ambitions in Italy need not be held hostage to their poor decisions. Let us separate these issues and build something greater.'\"\n\n\nÁlvaro looks at you. \"Do you see? We're not asking him to betray his brothers out of weakness. We're offering him something he wants more than protecting them. It's positive incentive, not just threat.\"\n\n\nWhy This Might Actually Work\n\n\n\"Alfonso's Actual Priorities:\n\n\nLooking at his actions, Alfonso cares most about:\n\n\nHis Italian ambitions (he's spending most of his time and resources there)\n\nAragonese interests broadly\n\nHis personal glory and dynasty\n\nHis brothers (family loyalty, but...)\n\n\n\"The question is: does he value his brothers enough to sacrifice Italian ambitions? Or can he be convinced that sacrificing the brothers serves his greater goals?\"\n\n\n\"Historical Precedent:\n\n\n\"Medieval kings sacrifice family members for strategic advantage all the time. It's ugly, but it happens. Brothers, sons, cousins - if the price is right and the alternative is worse, family loyalty bends.\"\n\n\n\"The Practical Reality:\n\n\n\"Alfonso is in Naples. He's fighting there. He needs resources. His brothers' rebellion in Castile is a distraction from what he really wants. If we offer him a way to: (a) save face ('I negotiated a strategic alliance'), (b) get what he actually wants (help with Italy), and (c) wash his hands of a messy situation (the Infantes), he might take it.\"\n\n\n\"The Infantes from His Perspective:\n\n\n\"They're his younger brothers. He has some family loyalty. But they're also problems - ambitious, rebellious, creating complications. If they succeed in Castile, they don't really help him. If they fail, they're liabilities. Either way, they're not advancing Aragon's interests much.\"\n\n\nThe Risks and Complications\n\n\nÁlvaro's excitement tempers slightly. He's too experienced not to see the problems.\n\n\n\"Risk One: Family Loyalty Is Real\n\n\n\"Even if Alfonso values Italy more than his brothers, abandoning them could damage his reputation. Other kings would judge him: 'He sacrificed his own blood for Italian gold.' That's a stain on honor.\"\n\n\n\"However, if framed correctly - 'I negotiated a strategic alliance that serves Aragon's interests' - he might salvage his reputation.\"\n\n\n\"Risk Two: The Infantes' Reaction\n\n\n\"If Alfonso withdraws protection, the Infantes become desperate. Desperate men are dangerous. They might do something rash - try to flee to France, attempt assassination, provoke immediate crisis. We'd need to move fast once Alfonso agrees.\"\n\n\n\"Risk Three: French Anger\n\n\n\"France has Italian ambitions too. If Castile openly supports Alfonso in Italy, France sees that as hostile. Could complicate other diplomatic options.\"\n\n\n\"Risk Four: Castilian Resources\n\n\n\"We're promising troops and money we don't have yet. We need to conquer Granada first, or at least unify the kingdom. If we promise too much too soon, we can't deliver.\"\n\n\n\"Risk Five: Alfonso Might Just Take the Offer and Still Protect His Brothers\n\n\n\"He could say 'wonderful, send me troops and money! Oh, and I still insist my brothers be treated fairly.' We need the agreement structured carefully - contingent on him withdrawing protection.\"\n\n\nThe Negotiation Strategy\n\n\n\"Here's how I'd actually structure this, Your Majesty:\"\n\n\nPhase One: The Feeler (October)\n\n\n\"Include this offer in your response to Alfonso's letter. Not as main point, but as intriguing possibility:\n\n\n'We understand Your Majesty's focus on Mediterranean ambitions. We note that a unified Castile could be valuable partner in such endeavors. We are open to discussing how our kingdoms might align interests, separate from the unfortunate matter of your brothers' actions in our realm.'\"\n\n\n\"Gauge his interest. If he bites, proceed to Phase Two.\"\n\n\nPhase Two: Formal Negotiations (October-November)\n\n\n\"Send a separate delegation - different from the Portuguese marriage negotiators. Someone who can talk strategy and Italy with Alfonso's advisors.\"\n\n\n\"Negotiate specific terms: How many troops? How much money? What timeline? What exactly does 'withdrawing protection' mean?\"\n\n\nPhase Three: The Deal (November-December)\n\n\n\"If successful, announce it at or shortly after the Royal Council. Formal alliance between Castile and Aragon. Alfonso publicly states the Infantes matter is Castilian internal affair.\"\n\n\n\"Then you move against them without fear of Aragonese intervention.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's Assessment\n\n\nHe sits back down, looks at you seriously.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, this is genuinely clever diplomacy. It addresses the real interests at play rather than just the surface conflict.\"\n\n\n\"Probability of Success: I'd say Moderate to Good - perhaps 55-65%.\"\n\n\n\"Why not higher?\"\n\n\nFamily loyalty is unpredictable\n\nAlfonso might not want to look like he abandoned his brothers\n\nTiming is tight (November Council is only six weeks away)\n\nWe're negotiating from somewhat weak position (failed arrest)\n\n\n\"Why not lower?\"\n\n\nAlfonso really does care more about Italy than Iberia\n\nThe offer addresses his actual strategic interests\n\nHe's practical, not sentimental\n\nThe alternative (supporting his brothers forever) doesn't benefit him much\n\n\n\"Compared to other approaches:\n\n\nBetter than trying to threaten Alfonso (doesn't work)\n\nBetter than ignoring him (he intervenes)\n\nMore expensive than Portuguese marriage alone, but potentially more decisive\n\nCould be combined WITH Portuguese marriage for maximum effect\"\n\n\nThe Combined Strategy\n\n\nÁlvaro's eyes light up. \"Actually, Your Majesty, what if we do BOTH?\"\n\n\n\"Portuguese Marriage (already decided): Secures succession, brings resources, doesn't threaten Alfonso.\"\n\n\n\"PLUS\"\n\n\n\"Aragonese Alliance for Italy: Gives Alfonso positive reason to withdraw protection from Infantes.\"\n\n\n\"The two together are incredibly powerful:\"\n\n\nPortuguese marriage removes succession concern, brings immediate resources\n\nAragonese alliance isolates the Infantes politically\n\nYou're building coalitions rather than just fighting enemies\n\nShows sophisticated statecraft\n\n\n\"November Council becomes much easier if you can announce:\"\n\n\nBetrothal to Portuguese princess (succession secured)\n\nAlliance with Aragon for Mediterranean interests (regional stability)\n\nInfantes are isolated, even their own brother won't protect them\n\nCrusade has papal backing and resources\n\n\n\"That's a position of overwhelming strength.\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro refills both wine cups, hands you one.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, when you walked in tonight after that assembly, you were crushed. You felt like you'd failed. But in this conversation, you've developed a strategy that could actually work. Portuguese marriage for stability, Aragonese alliance for neutralizing the Infantes, public displays for popular support.\"\n\n\n\"It's not one dramatic gesture. It's patient, multi-layered diplomacy. That's how kingdoms are actually secured.\"\n\n\nHe raises his cup. \"To thinking like a king, not just a crusader.\"\n\n\n\n\"Do you want to pursue this Alfonso negotiation alongside the Portuguese marriage? And if so, what specifically should we offer him in that initial letter?\""

      "say": "Thought process: Strategized diplomatic move to resolve Infantes conflict diplomatically.\n\nThis is a very smart diplomatic move by Juan. Let me think through what he's proposing:\n\n1. Immediate concession to Alfonso: Safe conduct for Infantes to the Council\n2. Promise to treat them with respect befitting their royal status\n3. This gives Alfonso face-saving way out\n4. Offers support for Naples ambitions\n5. Frames it as mutual benefit\n6. References Barcelona success as evidence of Castile-Aragon cooperation\n7. Offers personal meeting with Alfonso\n8. Timeline: Present at November Council\n\nThis is actually quite sophisticated. Let me have Álvaro analyze this carefully:\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n- Gives Alfonso something concrete immediately (safe conduct)\n- \"Fairly with all respect\" is vague enough to allow for conviction but dignified treatment\n- Saves Alfonso's face - he can say \"I secured fair treatment for my brothers\"\n- When they're found guilty, he can say \"they got fair hearing, that's all I demanded\"\n- The Naples offer sweetens the deal\n- Personal meeting offer shows respect\n- Barcelona reference is smart - shows cooperation is already working\n- Timeline is ambitious but possible\n\nPOTENTIAL ISSUES:\n- Very tight timeline (6 weeks to negotiate, finalize, and present)\n- Alfonso is in Naples - communication will be slow (letters take 2-3 weeks each way by ship)\n- He might want face-to-face negotiation before committing\n- The Infantes might reject attending even with safe conduct\n- \"Fairly with all respect\" could be interpreted many ways - Alfonso might demand more specifics\n- Presenting it at the Council might be premature if Alfonso hasn't fully agreed\n\nÁLVARO'S PERSPECTIVE:\nHe'd like this approach because:\n- It's proactive, not reactive\n- Gives Alfonso an off-ramp\n- The safe conduct decision was probably necessary anyway\n- Combining it with Naples offer makes it strategic, not capitulation\n- Shows Juan thinking ahead\n\nBut he'd also warn:\n\n\nThe diplomatic strategy requires extreme precision. I see significant risks with the compressed timeframe and potential communication delays. We must draft a meticulously worded proposal that provides Alfonso flexibility while protecting our core objectives. Multiple communication channels and backup strategies are essential to prevent potential diplomatic gridlock.\n\n\nDiplomatic Synthesis\n\n\nRoyal Chambers, Late Evening\n\n\n\nÁlvaro listens to your proposal intently, his expression shifting from thoughtful to impressed to concerned and back to impressed.\n\n\nWhen you finish, he's silent for a long moment. Then he nods slowly.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty... yes. This could work. This could actually work very well.\"\n\n\nHe stands, begins pacing with renewed energy. \"Let me explain why I think this approach is strong, but also where we need to be careful.\"\n\n\nWhy This Works\n\n\n\"The Immediate Concession\"\n\n\n\"Offering safe conduct right now, in your response letter, is smart for several reasons:\"\n\n\n\"First: It shows strength, not weakness. You're not being forced into it - you're choosing it as part of a broader diplomatic strategy. That's kingship. That's confidence.\"\n\n\n\"Second: It gives Alfonso something concrete to point to. When his nobles ask 'what did you get for your brothers?', he can say: 'I secured guarantee of safe conduct and fair hearing before the assembled nobility of Castile.' That's a real diplomatic victory he can claim.\"\n\n\n\"Third: It doesn't actually cost you anything you weren't going to do anyway. We already discussed that safe conduct was probably the smart move. Now you're getting diplomatic credit for it.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth: The phrase 'fairly with all respect befitting their royal status' is perfect.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro grins. \"It's beautifully vague. Alfonso hears: 'My brothers will be treated with dignity.' You mean: 'They'll get a fair trial with all proper forms, and if convicted, will be imprisoned in comfortable quarters befitting princes rather than thrown in a dungeon or executed.' Both interpretations are valid. That's good diplomacy.\"\n\n\n\"The Naples Support Offer\"\n\n\n\"Linking this to his Italian ambitions transforms the conversation from 'stop helping your rebellious brothers' to 'let's build strategic partnership.' Much better framing.\"\n\n\n\"Alfonso can tell himself and others: 'I didn't abandon my brothers. I negotiated alliance that serves Aragon's greater interests. My brothers will receive fair justice as part of this broader agreement.' That's the narrative that saves his honor.\"\n\n\n\"The Barcelona Reference\"\n\n\n\"Brilliant. You're reminding him: 'I was just in your city. Your subjects supported me. Your wife, my sister, helped me. Catalans gave me 82,000 florins. This isn't Castile vs Aragon - this is Iberian cooperation.' That's powerful.\"\n\n\n\"The Personal Meeting Offer\"\n\n\n\"Shows respect. Kings meeting face-to-face signals equality, partnership, serious intent. Alfonso will appreciate this gesture.\"\n\n\nThe Timeline Concerns\n\n\nÁlvaro's face grows more serious. \"Here's where we need to think carefully, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nHe sits down, pulls parchment toward him. \"The Royal Council is November 8th. That's six weeks from now. Let me map out the communication timeline:\"\n\n\nWeek 1 (October 1-7):\n\n\nDraft and send letter to Alfonso in Naples\n\nSend via fastest ship from Seville to Naples\n\nTravel time: 8-12 days by fast galley with good weather\n\nLetter arrives: October 10-14\n\n\nWeek 2-3 (October 8-21):\n\n\nAlfonso receives letter\n\nConsults with advisors\n\nDrafts response\n\nMaybe 5-10 days for deliberation and response\n\n\nWeek 4 (October 22-28):\n\n\nResponse sent back to Castile\n\nAnother 8-12 days travel\n\nArrives: Early November\n\n\nThat brings us to November 1-5 - barely a week before the Council.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, that's extremely tight. We'd have almost no time to react if Alfonso's response is anything other than immediate acceptance. And what if weather delays ships? What if he wants clarifications? What if he doesn't respond at all?\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's Recommendations\n\n\n\"I think we should do this, but with a more realistic timeline and a backup plan.\"\n\n\nModified Approach:\n\n\n\"Send the Letter Immediately - Tomorrow\"\n\n\n\"Don't wait. Every day matters. I'll draft it tonight, you review and sign tomorrow morning, it goes out on the afternoon tide with the fastest galley we can hire.\"\n\n\n\"Don't Wait for His Response Before the Council\"\n\n\n\"Here's the key adjustment: Don't make the November Council contingent on Alfonso's response. Instead:\"\n\n\n\"At the Council, you announce:\n\n\nSafe conduct granted to the Infantes (this is your decision, doesn't require Alfonso's approval)\n\nPortuguese betrothal (separate diplomatic achievement)\n\nThat you've reached out to Alfonso to discuss broader alliance and cooperation\n\nThat you hope to meet him personally to strengthen bonds between kingdoms\n\n\n\"You're showing Alfonso you're serious by taking these actions. You're building the partnership he'll want to join.\"\n\n\n\"The Full Deal Comes Later\"\n\n\n\"If Alfonso responds positively before November 8th - excellent. You can announce at Council that Aragon and Castile are aligning interests.\"\n\n\n\"But if his response comes after, or if he wants to negotiate details - fine. The Council accomplishes its goals anyway:\n\n\nInfantes get their hearing under safe conduct\n\nThey're condemned by nobility\n\nYou show strength and legitimacy\n\n\n\"Then in December-January, you finalize the Aragonese alliance. Alfonso sees how the Council went, sees the Infantes were fairly heard and found guilty, sees you married Portuguese and secured succession. He joins the winning side.\"\n\n\nThe Letter Itself - Careful Language\n\n\nÁlvaro begins drafting. \"We need to be very precise with language. Let me suggest phrasing:\"\n\n\nOn Safe Conduct:\n\n\n\"'We hereby grant Your Majesty's brothers, the Infantes Juan and Enrique, full safe conduct to attend the Royal Council of Castile in Seville on November 8th, 1430. They may travel to Seville, present their case before the assembled nobility, and depart safely. They will be treated throughout with all respect and dignity befitting princes of the royal house of Aragon.'\"\n\n\nOn Fair Treatment:\n\n\n\"'We commit that any judgment rendered will follow proper legal process, with the Infantes given full opportunity to answer all charges. We recognize they are your brothers and sons of the late King Fernando, and we will ensure their treatment reflects their royal status.'\"\n\n\nOn Naples:\n\n\n\"'We have observed with interest Your Majesty's pursuit of your rightful claims in the Kingdom of Naples. A strong Aragonese presence in Italy serves the interests of Christendom and Mediterranean stability. We are prepared to discuss how Castile might support these ambitions through military assistance, naval cooperation, and diplomatic backing.'\"\n\n\nOn Partnership:\n\n\n\"'Our kingdoms share history, culture, faith, and strategic interests. Our recent visit to Barcelona demonstrated the natural affinity between our peoples. We believe that a unified approach to Mediterranean challenges - whether in Italy or Iberia - would benefit both our realms far more than division or conflict.'\"\n\n\nOn Personal Meeting:\n\n\n\"'We would be honored to meet Your Majesty in person at your convenience to discuss these matters directly. The bonds between kings are strengthened through personal acquaintance, and we would value the opportunity to know our cousin better.'\"\n\n\nOn Mutual Benefit:\n\n\n\"'The question before us is simple: Do our kingdoms prosper more through cooperation or through internal conflicts that drain resources from our true objectives? We believe the answer is clear. Let us build something greater together.'\"\n\n\nÁlvaro looks up. \"Notice what this doesn't say: It doesn't explicitly demand Alfonso abandon his brothers. It doesn't threaten. It doesn't even directly connect the safe conduct to the Naples support. It presents them as separate but complementary elements of a broader partnership.\"\n\n\n\"Alfonso can accept all of it without feeling he's betrayed his brothers. He can tell himself: 'I secured fair treatment for them AND negotiated alliance for Aragon's interests.' Both true.\"\n\n\nThe Backup Plans\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, we need contingencies:\"\n\n\nIf Alfonso Responds Positively Before November 8th:\n\n\nAnnounce partnership at Council\n\nMaximum diplomatic triumph\n\nInfantes completely isolated\n\n\nIf Alfonso Doesn't Respond Before November 8th:\n\n\nProceed with Council as planned\n\nAnnounce safe conduct (your decision alone)\n\nMention outreach to Alfonso, hope for future cooperation\n\nStill a strong position\n\n\nIf Alfonso Responds Negatively or Demands More:\n\n\nYou've already granted safe conduct (looks good anyway)\n\nPortuguese marriage proceeds (doesn't require Alfonso)\n\nYou've made good faith effort at diplomacy (nobles will see this)\n\nAlfonso looks unreasonable if he rejects partnership offer\n\n\nIf Alfonso Doesn't Respond At All:\n\n\nProceed anyway\n\nHis silence isn't rejection, just slow diplomacy\n\nKeep door open for future negotiations\n\n\nThe Personal Meeting Question\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, about meeting Alfonso in person...\"\n\n\nÁlvaro looks concerned. \"I love the offer symbolically. But practically:\"\n\n\n\"Alfonso is in Naples. You're about to have the Royal Council in Seville. Then presumably you need to deal with the Infantes (however that plays out), marry Portuguese, possibly start crusade preparations...\"\n\n\n\"When would you actually travel to Naples? That's weeks of travel each way. And would it be safe? You'd be in Alfonso's city, potentially vulnerable...\"\n\n\n\"I suggest: Offer the meeting in the letter, but leave timing vague. 'At your convenience' or 'when our duties permit.' Show the respect of the offer without committing to specific timeline.\"\n\n\n\"Alternatively, suggest meeting somewhere in between - perhaps Barcelona again, or Valencia, or even on the border. 'We would be honored to meet wherever Your Majesty prefers - in Italy, in Aragon, or in neutral territory.'\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's Final Assessment\n\n\nHe sets down his quill and looks at you directly.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, this is genuinely impressive diplomacy. When you walked in tonight after the assembly, I was worried. You'd tried the straightforward approach - show evidence, demand justice - and it didn't work as well as hoped.\"\n\n\n\"But now you're thinking on multiple levels: Safe conduct as both moral high ground AND diplomatic concession. Portuguese marriage for stability. Aragonese alliance for isolating enemies. Public crusade campaign for popular support. Personal outreach to Alfonso for relationship-building.\"\n\n\n\"This is the kind of strategy that actually secures kingdoms.\"\n\n\n\"My only caution is timeline. Six weeks isn't much time for complex diplomacy. But we can manage it if we move fast and have backup plans.\"\n\n\nHe raises his wine cup. \"Send the letter tomorrow. Don't wait for response before Council. Present safe conduct decision as your choice. Build the partnership piece by piece. If Alfonso joins - excellent. If he hesitates - we're still strong.\"\n\n\n\n\"Should I draft the full letter now for your review? And do you want to include anything else - perhaps mention the papal bull and crusade to show you have divine backing Alfonso should respect?\""

He speaks aloud as he drafts, occasionally pausing to consider phrasing.\n\n\n\"Let me structure this properly. Medieval diplomatic correspondence has conventions - we need the right tone and formality...\"\n\n\nHe writes steadily for several minutes, occasionally scratching out words and revising. Finally, he slides the parchment across to you.\n\n\n\"Here, Your Majesty. Read through it, tell me what you'd change.\"\n\n\n\nDRAFT LETTER TO ALFONSO V OF ARAGON\n\n\n\nTo Our Most Esteemed Cousin, Alfonso, by the Grace of God King of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia, and Corsica, Duke of Athens and Neopatria, Count of Barcelona, Ruler in Sicily,\n\n\nFrom Juan, by the Grace of God King of Castile and León,\n\n\nGreetings in Christ Our Lord, and wishes for Your Majesty's health, prosperity, and success in all your righteous endeavors.\n\n\n\nOpening - Acknowledgment and Respect\n\n\nWe write in response to Your Majesty's letter of the third of September, which reached us after our return from pilgrimage. We acknowledge your concerns regarding your brothers, the Infantes Juan and Enrique, with the seriousness and respect such matters deserve.\n\n\nWe recognize that these princes are your blood, sons of the late King Fernando I of blessed memory, and members of the illustrious royal house of Aragon. Their station commands respect, and their relationship to Your Majesty adds weight to all considerations.\n\n\n\nThe Safe Conduct Grant\n\n\nAfter much prayer and consultation, we have determined to grant your brothers full and honorable safe conduct to attend the Royal Council of Castile, which shall convene in our city of Seville on the eighth day of November in this year of Our Lord 1430.\n\n\nThis safe conduct guarantees:\n\n\nSafe travel to Seville from wherever they may reside\n\nSecurity of person during the proceedings of the Council\n\nFull opportunity to present their case before the assembled nobility of our realm\n\nSafe departure from Seville when the Council concludes\n\n\nThroughout these proceedings, we commit that the Infantes shall be treated with all dignity, respect, and consideration befitting princes of royal blood. They shall have freedom to speak, to call witnesses, to answer charges, and to defend themselves according to proper legal process.\n\n\nWhatever judgment may emerge from the Council's deliberations, we assure Your Majesty that any consequences will reflect their royal status. We seek justice, not vengeance; resolution, not persecution.\n\n\n\nThe Papal Context\n\n\nWe must inform Your Majesty of developments during our pilgrimage, as they bear upon all matters concerning our realm and its relations with Christian kingdoms.\n\n\nBy the grace of God and through His mysterious providence, we were led to Rome itself, where we were granted audience with His Holiness Pope Martin V. What transpired in that sacred meeting we leave to the accounts of witnesses - Cardinal Giordano Orsini among them - but the result is clear and documented:\n\n\nHis Holiness granted us a plenary crusade bull for the completion of the Reconquista and the recovery of the Kingdom of Granada for Christendom. We were commissioned as Supreme Commander of this holy endeavor and blessed with relics of profound significance - a fragment of the True Cross itself and a bone of the blessed Saint James.\n\n\nWe mention this not to boast, but so Your Majesty understands the sacred obligation we now carry. The completion of Iberian Christian unity is no longer merely our personal ambition - it is a charge from the Vicar of Christ himself. This shapes all our considerations and decisions.\n\n\nWe pray Your Majesty will understand that we must order our realm's affairs in service of this holy commission. Internal divisions weaken not just Castile, but all of Christendom's capacity to advance Christ's kingdom.\n\n\n\nThe Barcelona Experience\n\n\nWe had the great pleasure during our journey of spending time in your magnificent city of Barcelona. The warmth with which your subjects received us, the generosity they showed toward our crusading mission, and the support they pledged moved us deeply.\n\n\nWe were also blessed to see our beloved sister, your esteemed wife Queen María, after many years of separation. She spoke with great affection of Your Majesty and with hope for continued harmony between our royal houses. Her wisdom and grace were evident in all our conversations.\n\n\nThis experience in Barcelona reminded us of a simple truth: the peoples of Castile and Aragon are not natural enemies. We share faith, language, culture, history, and the Iberian homeland. When we cooperate, remarkable things become possible. When we conflict, we both diminish.\n\n\n\nThe Italian Opportunity\n\n\nWe have observed with great interest Your Majesty's pursuit of your rightful claims in the Kingdom of Naples and your efforts to establish Aragonese influence throughout Italy and the Mediterranean.\n\n\nThese are worthy ambitions that serve not only your dynasty but the broader interests of Christian kingdoms in that vital region. A strong, stable Aragonese presence in Italy provides counterweight to other powers and advances Christian civilization in the Mediterranean world.\n\n\nWe wish Your Majesty to know: a unified and secure Castile, properly ordered under our crown and dedicated to completing the Reconquista, could be a valuable partner in your Mediterranean endeavors.\n\n\nOnce our internal matters are resolved and the crusade against Granada is launched, we would have the capacity to provide:\n\n\nMilitary forces for Italian campaigns\n\nNaval support in the Mediterranean\n\nFinancial assistance for your righteous claims\n\nDiplomatic backing with His Holiness and other Christian monarchs\n\n\nWe are prepared to discuss specific terms and commitments when the time is appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe Strategic Vision\n\n\nYour Majesty, we believe our kingdoms face a choice that will shape the next generation:\n\n\nDo we expend our resources, our blood, and our energy in internal Iberian conflicts? Or do we unite our considerable strengths toward the great tasks that await - for you in Italy, for us in Granada?\n\n\nThe Infantes matter has created tension between our realms. We do not minimize this. There are legitimate grievances and concerns on multiple sides. But we propose that this need not define our relationship.\n\n\nWe offer a path forward:\n\n\nYour brothers receive fair hearing and treatment befitting their station\n\nCastilian internal matters are resolved according to Castilian law and the judgment of our assembled nobility\n\nOur kingdoms build partnership focused on our respective strategic goals\n\nWe support your Italian ambitions; you respect our sacred crusading commission\n\n\nThis allows both of us to achieve what we truly seek, rather than remaining entangled in conflicts that serve neither kingdom's interests.\n\n\n\nPersonal Meeting Proposal\n\n\nWe would be deeply honored to meet Your Majesty in person to discuss these matters directly and to strengthen the bonds between our crowns. The relationship between kings is built not just through letters and ambassadors, but through personal acquaintance and understanding.\n\n\nWe recognize Your Majesty is currently engaged in vital work in Naples, and we ourselves face numerous duties in preparation for the November Council and the crusade beyond. Therefore, we propose that we meet at whatever time and place Your Majesty finds most convenient - whether in Italy, in Aragon, in Castile, or in neutral territory - when our respective duties permit.\n\n\nSuch a meeting could forge partnership that benefits both our realms for decades to come.\n\n\n\nClosing\n\n\nYour Majesty, we write with genuine desire for peace, partnership, and mutual prosperity between Aragon and Castile. We grant your brothers safe conduct and fair treatment because it is both just and wise. We offer support for your Italian ambitions because we see opportunity for cooperation. We propose personal meeting because we value the relationship between our houses.\n\n\nThe matter of your brothers' actions during our absence must be addressed - this we cannot ignore, for a king who tolerates rebellion invites chaos. But how it is addressed, and what follows after, remains to be determined. We prefer resolution that serves both our kingdoms' interests rather than conflict that weakens us both.\n\n\nWe await Your Majesty's response with hope and with prayers for your success, health, and wisdom.\n\n\nMay God guide us both toward decisions that honor Him, serve our peoples, and advance Christian civilization.\n\n\nWritten at our city of Seville, this twenty-ninth day of September, in the year of Our Lord 1430,\n\n\nJuan II, by the Grace of God, King of Castile and León\n\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down his quill and looks at you.\n\n\n\"That's the full draft, Your Majesty. Let me explain the strategic choices I made:\"\n\n\nKey Strategic Elements\n\n\n\"The Structure\":\n\"I put the safe conduct grant early and clearly. That's the immediate concession that gives Alfonso something concrete. Everything else builds from there.\"\n\n\n\"The Papal Bull Section\":\n\"I included it, but framed carefully. Not as threat ('the Pope backs me, so submit'), but as context ('I have sacred obligation that shapes my decisions'). Shows strength without being aggressive.\"\n\n\n\"The Italian Support\":\n\"Mentioned but not in quid-pro-quo format. Not 'if you abandon your brothers, then I'll help in Italy.' Instead: 'Here's what partnership could look like.' More subtle, less transactional.\"\n\n\n\"The Barcelona Reference\":\n\"Emphasizes positive recent experience and mentions María. Reminds him you're family, not just political rivals.\"\n\n\n\"The Meeting Offer\":\n\"Vague on timing, flexible on location. Shows respect without committing to specific schedule.\"\n\n\n\"The Tone Throughout\":\n\"Respectful, reasonable, but firm on essentials. You're not begging - you're proposing partnership between equals.\"\n\n\n\"What It Doesn't Say\":\n\"Notice I don't explicitly say: 'The Infantes will be found guilty.' Just that they'll get fair hearing and proper treatment. Alfonso can read between the lines, but you're not backing yourself into corner.\"\n\n\n\"I also don't threaten. No 'if you don't agree, then...' Just positive inducements.\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro leans back. \"Your Majesty, read it through. Change anything you want. Add, remove, rephrase. This is your letter - your voice should be in it.\"\n\n\n\"Once you're satisfied, I'll have scribes make clean copy on finest parchment with your royal seal. It goes out tomorrow on fastest galley to Naples.\"\n\n\n\nWhat changes, if any, do you want to make to the letter?"

Solid, reliable, knows protocol.\"\n\n\n\"The Oral Instructions - Carefully Phrased\":\n\n\nÁlvaro begins writing what the messenger should say:\n\n\n\n\"If granted audience after delivering the letter, Fernán should say:\"\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, my lord the King of Castile instructed me to convey, beyond what is written in his letter, his profound hope that this correspondence might begin a fruitful dialogue between your kingdoms.\n\n\nHis Majesty understands that Your Majesty's duties in Naples are pressing and numerous. He would never presume to demand hasty response to matters of such importance.\n\n\nHowever, His Majesty wishes Your Majesty to know that the Royal Council convenes in Seville on November 8th. Your brothers the Infantes will attend under the safe conduct His Majesty has granted.\n\n\nShould Your Majesty's response regarding the broader partnership discussed in the letter arrive before that date, it would provide valuable context and clarity for those proceedings. His Majesty believes that understanding Your Majesty's perspective before meeting with your brothers would serve the interests of all parties and contribute to the most constructive resolution.\n\n\nOf course, His Majesty fully respects that Your Majesty may require more time for proper consideration of such significant matters. Should Your Majesty's response arrive after November 8th, His Majesty will receive it with equal attention and regard.\n\n\nHis Majesty simply wished Your Majesty to understand the timeline, so that Your Majesty might respond according to whatever schedule best serves your kingdom's interests.\n\n\nIs there any message Your Majesty would wish me to convey in return to my lord the King of Castile?\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro looks up. \"See how this works?\"\n\n\n\"The Strategic Phrasing:\"\n\n\n\"'Valuable context and clarity' - This suggests (without stating explicitly) that Alfonso's response could influence how things go at the Council. It hints at benefit of responding quickly without demanding it.\"\n\n\n\"'Understanding Your Majesty's perspective before meeting with your brothers' - This is the key phrase. It subtly says: 'If you want to shape how I handle the meeting with Juan and Enrique, respond before November 8th.'\"\n\n\n\"'Would serve the interests of all parties' - Including the Infantes' interests. Suggesting that Alfonso's response might help his brothers without saying it directly.\"\n\n\n\"'Fully respects that Your Majesty may require more time' - Gives him the out. Doesn't pressure him. But the implication is clear: faster response = more influence over outcomes.\"\n\n\n\"Ending with invitation for return message - Shows respect, opens immediate dialogue, makes this feel like conversation between equals.\"\n\n\nThe Logistics\n\n\nÁlvaro stands, energized now. \"Here's how we execute this tomorrow:\"\n\n\nMorning (September 29th):\n\n\nScribes produce clean copy of letter on finest parchment\n\nYou review and sign with royal seal\n\nLetter sealed in protective case\n\nFernán Álvarez briefed thoroughly on oral instructions\n\nHe practices the phrasing until perfect\n\n\nMidday:\n\n\nSmall delegation assembles at port: Fernán, two servants, one guard\n\nLight retinue - this is about speed, not display\n\nHire the fastest galley available\n\n\nThe Ship:\n\n\nPay premium for speed - perhaps 800-1,000 maravedís\n\nCaptain instructed: \"This message goes to the King of Aragon in Naples. Every day matters. Push your crew hard, I'll pay bonuses for speed.\"\n\nDirect route: Seville → Strait of Gibraltar → Mediterranean → Naples\n\nWith good weather and hard rowing: 10-12 days possible\n\n\nAfternoon:\n\n\nShips departs on afternoon tide (September 29th)\n\nExpected arrival Naples: October 9-11\n\nAlfonso receives and reads: October 10-12\n\nIf he responds quickly (2-3 days): Letter sent back October 12-15\n\nReturn journey: October 12-15 to October 22-27\n\nArrives Seville: October 22-27 (two weeks before Council)\n\n\n\"That gives us window of 10-14 days before November 8th to know Alfonso's position. Tight, but workable.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's Additional Suggestions\n\n\n\"Include a Gift\"\n\n\n\"We should send something with the letter. Not lavish - that looks like bribery. But appropriate for king-to-king correspondence.\"\n\n\nSuggestions:\n\n\nFine Castilian wine (symbolic of friendship, not too expensive)\n\nManuscript (perhaps a beautifully illuminated religious text)\n\nDamascene blade (shows respect for his warrior reputation)\n\n\n\"I recommend the wine and the manuscript. Total value maybe 500-1,000 maravedís. Shows respect without being obsequious.\"\n\n\n\"Backup Communication\"\n\n\n\"We should also send a separate, faster message to your sister María in Barcelona. Tell her what's happening, ask her to write to Alfonso supporting this partnership. Wives have influence, and María wants peace between her birth family and her marriage family.\"\n\n\n\"That message can go overland and be in Barcelona in a week. María's letter reaches Alfonso maybe 2-3 days after yours. Reinforcement.\"\n\n\n\"The Portuguese Delegation\"\n\n\n\"Speaking of tomorrow - I should also prepare the Portuguese marriage delegation to depart. We discussed that earlier.\"\n\n\n\"Should they leave same day as the Alfonso letter? Or wait a day or two? Probably doesn't matter much, but if they leave same day, there's symbolic impact: 'Castile is moving on multiple diplomatic fronts simultaneously.' Shows energy, momentum.\"\n\n\nThe November Council Contingencies\n\n\nÁlvaro sits back down. \"Your Majesty, let's plan for different scenarios:\"\n\n\nScenario 1: Alfonso Responds Positively Before November 8th\n\n\n\"Best case. At the Council you announce:\n\n\nSafe conduct granted (your decision)\n\nPortuguese betrothal secured (your achievement)\n\nPartnership with Aragon being formed (Alfonso's agreement)\n\nSacred crusade mission with papal backing\n\n\n\"The Infantes arrive to find themselves completely isolated. Their own brother has effectively withdrawn protection in exchange for partnership with you. They're facing assembled Castilian nobility who know Alfonso won't intervene. They're done.\"\n\n\nScenario 2: Alfonso Responds But Wants More Negotiations\n\n\n\"He says 'I'm interested in partnership, but let's discuss details.' Not full agreement but positive signal.\"\n\n\n\"At Council you announce:\n\n\nSafe conduct granted\n\nPortuguese betrothal\n\nProductive dialogue begun with Aragon about Mediterranean cooperation\n\nInfantes will receive fair hearing as promised to their brother\n\n\n\"Still strong position. Shows you're building coalitions. Follow-up negotiations happen after Council.\"\n\n\nScenario 3: Alfonso Doesn't Respond by November 8th\n\n\n\"You proceed with Council as planned:\n\n\nSafe conduct granted (you made that decision regardless)\n\nPortuguese betrothal announced\n\nMention you've reached out to Alfonso seeking partnership\n\nInfantes get their hearing, likely found guilty by nobles\n\nAlfonso's delayed response arrives later, but you've already demonstrated good faith\n\n\n\"Still works. You look reasonable, diplomatic, forward-thinking.\"\n\n\nScenario 4: Alfonso Responds Negatively\n\n\n\"He rejects partnership, reaffirms protection of brothers.\"\n\n\n\"At Council:\n\n\nSafe conduct already granted (keeps your word)\n\nPortuguese betrothal provides strength\n\nYou've made good-faith effort at diplomacy (nobles see this)\n\nProceed with Infantes hearing knowing Alfonso remains hostile\n\nMakes future decisions harder but at least you tried\n\n\n\"Less ideal, but you've lost nothing by trying.\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro looks at you seriously. \"In all scenarios, Your Majesty, you're taking initiative. You're building, not just reacting. Portuguese marriage, Aragonese outreach, public crusade campaign, safe conduct for fair hearing - these are all positive moves.\"\n\n\n\"Even if Alfonso says no, you look like the reasonable king trying to build partnerships while he looks like the one choosing conflict to protect his rebellious brothers.\"\n\n\nFinal Question\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, are you satisfied with:\n\n\nThe letter text as drafted\n\nFernán Álvarez as messenger with those oral instructions\n\nSending gift of wine and manuscript\n\nDeparture tomorrow afternoon\n\nAlso sending message to María in Barcelona\n\nPortuguese delegation departing same day or next\n\n\n\"Or do you want to adjust anything?\"\n\n\nHe grins tiredly. \"It's late. This has been quite an evening. We started with you feeling crushed after the assembly. Now we have Portuguese marriage negotiations, Aragonese partnership proposal, and a sophisticated multi-layered strategy.\"\n\n\n\"Not bad for one night's work.\"\n\n\n\nDo you approve these arrangements, or is there anything you'd like to modify?"

He's asking Álvaro to proceed with preparations, and they'll meet tomorrow to finalize and sign everything. This is a good natural conclusion to this lengthy planning session.\n\nI should:\n1. Have Álvaro acknowledge the orders with appropriate respect and perhaps emotion\n2. Show him gathering materials to begin work\n3. Maybe a brief moment of camaraderie/reflection on the evening\n4. Transition to the next morning for the signing ceremony\n5. Then ask what the player wants to do next\n\nThis wraps up the diplomatic planning nicely and sets up the next phase of actions.\n\n\nEnd of the Long Night\n\n\nRoyal Chambers, Very Late Evening - September 28, 1430\n\n\n\nÁlvaro stands, gathering the various parchments and notes scattered across the table. For a moment, he just looks at you, and something shifts in his expression - the careful political mask falling away to show genuine emotion.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty... Juan...\" He uses your name again. \"When you returned tonight from that assembly, discouraged and uncertain, I was worried. I've seen kings break under less pressure than you face.\"\n\n\nHe organizes the documents with careful hands. \"But tonight you've shown why I believe in you. Not just because you have papal backing or sacred relics or divine certainty. But because when something doesn't work, you think. You adapt. You build alliances instead of just fighting enemies.\"\n\n\nA tired smile crosses his face. \"Your father would be proud. He was a good king, but he could be... rigid. You have his strength but also flexibility he sometimes lacked.\"\n\n\nHe moves toward the door, then pauses. \"Get some sleep, Your Majesty. Tomorrow is just the beginning. We have six weeks until the Council, and much to accomplish. But tonight... tonight we planned well.\"\n\n\n\"I'll have everything ready for your review and signature by midday. The scribes will work through the night - they'll complain, but they'll do it.\" He grins. \"I'll tell them the King's business waits for no one.\"\n\n\nHe bows formally. \"Until tomorrow, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nThe door closes softly behind him, leaving you alone in the chamber. Through the window, you can see Seville sleeping below - your city, your kingdom, your burden and your opportunity.\n\n\n\nThe Next Morning - September 29, 1430\n\n\nThe sun rises over Seville. In the royal scriptorium, bleary-eyed scribes have produced three beautifully written letters on the finest parchment:\n\n\nLetter One: To King Alfonso V in Naples - The full diplomatic proposal, carefully sealed\nLetter Two: To Queen María in Barcelona - Briefer, more personal, asking for her support with Alfonso\nLetter Three: To King João I (or Prince Duarte) in Lisbon - The Portuguese marriage delegation's formal introduction\n\n\nBy midmorning, Álvaro has everything arranged in your private study:\n\n\nThe three letters laid out for your review\n\nRoyal seal warmed and ready\n\nRed wax prepared\n\nFernán Álvarez de Toledo waiting to receive his instructions as messenger to Naples\n\nAdmiral Diego Hurtado de Mendoza ready to lead the Portuguese delegation\n\nGifts prepared: two casks of exceptional Castilian wine, a beautifully illuminated Book of Hours\n\nThe galleys hired and provisioned at the port\n\n\nÁlvaro stands by the window. \"Your Majesty, everything is ready. Read through the letters one final time, make any last adjustments, then seal and sign. The ships can depart by early afternoon if you're satisfied.\"\n\n\n\nYou review the letters. All three are written exactly as discussed last night - diplomatic, respectful, strategic. The Alfonso letter offers partnership and safe conduct. The María letter asks for her help as intermediary. The Portuguese letter begins marriage negotiations.\n\n\nAs you read, Álvaro mentions: \"The public crusade campaign you suggested - displaying the banner and relics like you did in Barcelona and Florence. We should discuss timing. Start immediately? Wait until after these diplomatic moves are in motion? What's your preference?\"\n\n\nHe also adds: \"And Captain Fernán should return from Castile within the week with report on how the Infantes reacted to the arrest attempt and current political situation. We'll have better intelligence soon.\"\n\n\n\nThe Signing\n\n\nWhen you're ready, you sit at the desk. Álvaro hands you the quill.\n\n\nOne by one, you sign each letter with your full royal signature:\n\n\nJuan II, Rex Castellae et Legionis\n\n\nThe royal seal is pressed into hot red wax on each document - the castle and lion of Castile, symbol of your authority.\n\n\nFernán Álvarez and Admiral Diego watch this ceremony with appropriate gravity. They're being entrusted with missions that could determine the kingdom's future.\n\n\nÁlvaro hands the sealed Alfonso letter to Fernán: \"To Naples, fastest speed possible. You know your instructions.\"\n\n\nThe Portuguese letter to Admiral Diego: \"To Lisbon, with all diplomatic courtesy. Negotiate well.\"\n\n\nThe letter to María will go via trusted courier overland to Barcelona.\n\n\n\nBy early afternoon, the galleys depart. You watch from the Alcázar's tower as they move down the Guadalquivir toward the sea - tiny ships carrying words that might reshape kingdoms.\n\n\nÁlvaro stands beside you. \"The dice are cast, Your Majesty. Now we wait, prepare, and build.\"\n\n\nHe turns to face you. \"Six weeks until the Council. What's our priority now?\"\n\n\n\nImmediate Priorities (Choose Your Focus)\n\n\nYou could:\n\n\nLaunch the public crusade campaign - Display banner and relics at Seville Cathedral, recruit crusaders, raise funds (like Barcelona/Florence)\n\nMeet with your secret cabinet - Juan de Daza, Diego Gómez de Sandoval, Rodrigo Manrique, etc. - for intelligence updates on the kingdom's situation\n\nInspect and expand your crusader force - Work with Rodrigo and the 62 crusaders, begin serious training and recruitment\n\nPrepare for the Infantes' arrival - Plan the logistics of the November Council, how the hearing will be conducted, what evidence will be presented\n\nAddress personal matters - Prayer, confession with Fray Hernando about recent events, spiritual preparation\n\nSend additional diplomatic messages - Perhaps to the Military Orders, or to specific neutral nobles, trying to win support before the Council\n\n\n\nWhat would you like to focus on first, Your Majesty?"

This is smart - it gets ahead of the narrative, shows Juan is confident and merciful, and makes it hard for the Infantes to refuse without looking cowardly.\n\nÁlvaro should discuss how to frame this announcement publicly, what messaging to use, and what the effects will be. This is good political theater.\n\n\nPublic Announcement Strategy\n\n\nAlcázar of Seville, September 29, 1430 - Early Afternoon\n\n\n\nÁlvaro's face lights up with approval. \"Excellent instinct, Your Majesty. Making this public immediately serves multiple purposes.\"\n\n\nHe begins pacing, thinking through the implications. \"Let me explain why this is smart, and then we'll craft the announcement carefully.\"\n\n\nWhy This Works\n\n\n\"It Controls the Narrative\"\n\n\n\"Right now, rumors are flying. The Infantes are telling their version - 'the King tried to arrest us unlawfully, we had to defend ourselves.' Your supporters say 'they're rebels who defied justice.' The neutral nobles don't know what to think.\"\n\n\n\"By publicly announcing safe conduct, YOU set the story: 'The King, in his wisdom and mercy, seeks peaceful resolution. He will meet with the Infantes personally to hear their grievances and resolve this matter before the assembled nobility.'\"\n\n\n\"That's the king everyone wants - strong but merciful, confident but reasonable.\"\n\n\n\"It Puts Pressure on the Infantes\"\n\n\n\"Once this is public, the Infantes face a choice: Accept and attend, or refuse and look like cowards avoiding justice.\"\n\n\n\"If they refuse, everyone asks: 'Why won't they answer charges face-to-face? What are they afraid of?' They lose sympathy.\"\n\n\n\"If they accept - which they almost certainly will, since Alfonso's letter asked for exactly this - then they're coming to Seville, your territory, to face judgment before your nobles. That's what you want.\"\n\n\n\"It Reassures the Neutrals\"\n\n\n\"Many nobles worried you'd pursue civil war. This announcement says: 'No, the King wants peace. He's giving the Infantes every chance for fair hearing.' That's reassuring.\"\n\n\n\"It makes you look like the adult in the room while the Infantes look like the troublemakers.\"\n\n\n\"It Gets Ahead of Alfonso's Response\"\n\n\n\"When Alfonso receives your letter in 10-12 days and sees you've already publicly granted safe conduct - exactly what he asked for - he can't complain. You've given him what he wanted before he could demand it.\"\n\n\n\"Makes you look generous rather than pressured.\"\n\n\nCrafting the Public Message\n\n\nÁlvaro sits at the desk, pulls fresh parchment. \"We need several versions of this message for different audiences. Let me draft them.\"\n\n\nVersion One: Formal Royal Decree\n\n\n\"This goes to all major cities, read in public squares and churches:\"\n\n\n\nROYAL DECREE\n\n\nBy Order of His Majesty Juan II, King of Castile and León\n\n\nBe it known throughout our realm:\n\n\nWe, Juan II, by the Grace of God King of Castile and León, having returned from pilgrimage blessed by His Holiness Pope Martin V with a sacred commission to complete the Reconquista, do hereby address the matter of tensions that arose during our absence.\n\n\nIt has come to our attention that certain disagreements and misunderstandings have created division within our realm. We deeply regret any conflict among our subjects and seek resolution through peaceful means and proper justice.\n\n\nTherefore, we do hereby grant FULL AND COMPLETE SAFE CONDUCT to our cousins, the Infantes Juan and Enrique of Aragon, to attend the Royal Council which shall convene in our city of Seville on the eighth day of November in this year of Our Lord 1430.\n\n\nThis safe conduct guarantees:\n\n\nSafe travel to and from Seville\n\nSecurity of person during all proceedings\n\nFull opportunity to address the assembled nobility and answer any charges\n\nTreatment befitting their royal station\n\n\nWe desire to meet with our cousins personally, to hear their perspective directly, and to resolve matters face-to-face as is proper among princes of royal blood. We believe that misunderstandings can be clarified, grievances can be heard, and justice can be served through open dialogue before the nobility of Castile.\n\n\nWe call upon all parties to set aside hostility and approach the Council with sincere desire for truth and peaceful resolution. Our kingdom faces great challenges - the sacred crusade against Granada chief among them - and we cannot afford continued internal division.\n\n\nLet all Christians rejoice that their King seeks peace and justice through proper process rather than the sword.\n\n\nGiven at Seville, this twenty-ninth day of September, 1430\n\n\nJuan II, Rex Castellae et Legionis\n\n\n\nÁlvaro looks up. \"That's the formal version. Notice the framing:\"\n\n\nKey Phrases Explained:\n\n\n\"Having returned from pilgrimage blessed by His Holiness\" - Establishes your legitimacy and divine backing immediately\n\n\n\"Certain disagreements and misunderstandings\" - Deliberately vague. Doesn't call it rebellion in the formal decree. That would be too provocative and prevent acceptance.\n\n\n\"Our cousins\" - Emphasizes family relationship, shows respect\n\n\n\"Desire to meet with our cousins personally\" - This is the key. Makes it about you wanting direct conversation, not about punishing them. You're the reasonable one seeking dialogue.\n\n\n\"Misunderstandings can be clarified\" - Leaves them room to save face. They can claim they didn't actually rebel, just misunderstood your intentions. That's how they'll accept.\n\n\n\"Our kingdom faces great challenges - the sacred crusade\" - Subtly reminds everyone: the real enemy is Granada, not each other. Frames internal conflict as distraction from holy mission.\n\n\nVersion Two: Letter to Major Nobles\n\n\n\"This goes directly to the ~80 nobles who will attend the Council:\"\n\n\nÁlvaro drafts a more personal version:\n\n\n\nTo [Noble Name], Esteemed Subject of the Crown,\n\n\nWe write to inform you of our decision regarding the Royal Council scheduled for November 8th in Seville.\n\n\nAs you know, certain tensions arose during our pilgrimage to Rome, where by God's grace we received Pope Martin V's blessing and commission for a crusade against Granada. Upon our return, we found our realm divided, with some nobles supporting the actions taken during our absence and others questioning them.\n\n\nAfter much prayer and consultation, we have determined that the best path forward is direct dialogue. We have therefore granted full safe conduct to the Infantes Juan and Enrique of Aragon to attend the Council and present their perspective before the assembled nobility.\n\n\nWe ask you, as loyal subject and valued counselor, to attend this Council with open mind and commitment to justice. All parties will be heard. Evidence will be examined. Truth will emerge through proper process witnessed by the realm's leading nobles.\n\n\nOur sacred duty to complete the Reconquista requires a unified kingdom. Internal divisions weaken us all. We trust that the Council will clarify matters and allow us to move forward together toward the great work God has set before us.\n\n\nWe look forward to your presence in Seville.\n\n\nJuan II, King of Castile and León\n\n\n\n\"This version is more personal, acknowledges that there are different perspectives, asks for their judgment rather than demanding it. Makes them feel like participants in justice, not just witnesses.\"\n\n\nVersion Three: Message to the Infantes Directly\n\n\n\"We should also send them a direct message, separate from the public announcement:\"\n\n\n\nTo Our Cousins, the Infantes Juan and Enrique of Aragon,\n\n\nWe write to inform you that we have granted you full safe conduct to attend the Royal Council in Seville on November 8th, 1430.\n\n\nWe wish to meet with you personally, as is proper among princes, to discuss the events of recent months and to resolve matters face-to-face before the nobility of Castile.\n\n\nYou will have complete opportunity to present your case, to answer any charges, and to offer your perspective. We seek truth and justice through proper process, not through continued conflict.\n\n\nWe ask that you respond to this invitation and inform us of your intentions so that proper arrangements can be made for your arrival and accommodation.\n\n\nWe remain your cousin,\n\n\nJuan II, King of Castile and León\n\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down the quill. \"Simple, direct, respectful. Gives them the information clearly without drama.\"\n\n\nDistribution Strategy\n\n\n\"Here's how we spread this message across the kingdom over the next week:\"\n\n\nDay 1 (Today - September 29):\n\n\nFormal decree posted in Seville's main plaza and read at cathedral after Mass\n\nLetters dispatched to all major cities (Toledo, Burgos, Valladolid, Córdoba, Salamanca, etc.)\n\nPersonal letters to the ~80 nobles expected at Council\n\nDirect message to the Infantes (sent via herald to wherever they're residing)\n\n\nDays 2-3 (September 30 - October 1):\n\n\nMajor cities receive and post the decree\n\nCathedral announcements throughout Andalusia\n\nWord spreads through markets and taverns\n\n\nWeek's End (By October 5):\n\n\nMost of kingdom has heard the news\n\nThe Infantes have received your message and will respond\n\n\nExpected Responses:\n\n\nÁlvaro ticks them off on his fingers:\n\n\n\"The Infantes:\"\n\"They'll accept. They have to - it's exactly what their brother Alfonso asked for, and refusing makes them look guilty. They'll probably send a reply like: 'We graciously accept His Majesty's invitation and welcome the opportunity to address misunderstandings before the nobility.'\"\n\n\n\"Your Supporters:\"\n\"Might be nervous. Some will ask: 'Why are you giving them safe conduct? Why not arrest them?' You'll need to reassure them this is strategy, not weakness. The public hearing destroys the Infantes politically even if they walk away physically free.\"\n\n\n\"The Neutrals:\"\n\"This is exactly what they wanted - peaceful resolution without civil war. They'll be relieved. Some will shift toward supporting you just for being reasonable.\"\n\n\n\"The Infantes' Supporters:\"\n\"Can't really complain. You're offering their patrons fair hearing. If they continue to support armed defiance, they look unreasonable now.\"\n\n\n\"Common People:\"\n\"Will hear: 'The King returned from Rome with papal blessing and now seeks peace.' That's a good story. Builds your reputation.\"\n\n\nThe Private Reality\n\n\nÁlvaro leans forward, voice quiet. \"Your Majesty, we both know this isn't really about reconciliation. The Infantes rebelled. They'll be found guilty. This safe conduct is theater - necessary theater, but theater nonetheless.\"\n\n\n\"The public message is about peace and dialogue. The private reality is about isolating them politically before destroying them. That's fine - that's how politics works.\"\n\n\n\"Just remember: once they're in Seville under safe conduct, you cannot violate it. That would destroy everything. Let them come, let them speak, let the nobles judge them. Then they leave. Then, later, you move.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"Can you do that? Can you sit there in November, listen to them accuse you and me of tyranny, watch them walk away free, and trust that justice comes afterward?\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro's Final Recommendation\n\n\n\"Send all three versions - the public decree, the letters to nobles, the direct message to the Infantes. Do it today. Strike while the moment is right.\"\n\n\n\"This announcement combined with your letters to Alfonso and Portugal creates a narrative of decisive action. 'The King returned, immediately started solving problems, reached out diplomatically on multiple fronts, granted clemency to rebels while maintaining justice.' That's strong kingship.\"\n\n\nHe gathers the drafted documents. \"I'll have scribes produce clean copies within two hours. You can review and approve by late afternoon. By evening, messengers will be riding in all directions carrying your decree.\"\n\n\n\"Tomorrow morning, all of Seville will be talking about it. By week's end, the whole kingdom knows.\"\n\n\n\n\"Do you approve this approach, Your Majesty? Any changes to the messaging or distribution?\""

See how the clasps turned out\n\nLet me think about timing - we're on September 29, 1430. The clasps were ordered in Barcelona on August 28, with Diego sent ahead to Seville with specifications. That gives craftsmen about a month (late August to late September) to produce them. That's realistic for the simpler ones (common iron clasps) but the more ornate ones (commander, supreme commander, chaplain, papal legate) might need more time or might not all be finished.\n\nI should:\n1.

Rodrigo speaks first: \"Your Majesty, you wanted to discuss the cathedral display?\"\n\n\n\nThe Cathedral Campaign - Rodrigo's Report\n\n\nRodrigo steps forward, all business. \"Your Majesty, after Barcelona's success, I began preliminary discussions with the Cathedral of Seville's chapter while waiting for your return.\"\n\n\nHe pulls out notes. \"The cathedral here is even more magnificent than Barcelona's - larger, more pilgrims, more visibility. The canons are enthusiastic about hosting the relics. They see it as tremendous honor.\"\n\n\nThe Logistics Proposed:\n\n\n\"Location: Main altar area, similar setup to Barcelona. Wooden barriers creating sacred space, guards at corners, controlled crowd flow.\"\n\n\n\"Duration: I recommend two weeks - October 1st through October 14th. That gives us three weeks after for final Council preparations.\"\n\n\n\"Daily Schedule:\n\n\nDawn Mass with relics displayed (6:00 AM)\n\nMorning viewing (7:00 AM - Noon)\n\nMidday prayers and sermon (Noon - 1:00 PM)\n\nAfternoon viewing (2:00 PM - 6:00 PM)\n\nEvening vespers with relics (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM)\n\n\n\"Opens seven days per week. Cathedral expects thousands.\"\n\n\nSecurity:\n\n\n\"We have sixty-two crusaders now. I propose:\n\n\nFour guards on the relics at all times (rotating shifts)\n\nAdditional crusaders managing crowd flow\n\nCathedral's own guards at entrances\n\nEveryone in white tabards - highly visible, distinctive\n\n\n\"The crusaders themselves become part of the display. People see the banner, the relics, AND the white-clad soldiers. Makes it real.\"\n\n\nRecruitment Station:\n\n\n\"Just like Barcelona - table near the entrance. Applicants give names, we assess them physically and spiritually. Fray Hernando has agreed to hear confessions daily for potential crusaders.\"\n\n\n\"Based on Barcelona numbers, I expect 300-400 applications over two weeks. If even a quarter are suitable, that's 75-100 new crusaders. Combined with our sixty-two, we'd have 137-162 trained crusaders by November Council.\"\n\n\nFundraising:\n\n\n\"Also like Barcelona - donation table managed by Diego. No pressure, just opportunity. Seville is wealthy. The Andalusian nobility lives here. We could raise 50,000-100,000 florins if the campaign goes well.\"\n\n\nYour Personal Involvement:\n\n\nRodrigo looks at you carefully. \"Your Majesty, in Florence you gave that speech that set Italy ablaze. In Barcelona, you spoke more briefly but powerfully. The question is: how visible do you want to be here?\"\n\n\nHe outlines options:\n\n\nOption 1: High Visibility\n\n\nYou attend daily Mass with the relics\n\nGive speeches or addresses several times during the two weeks\n\nPersonally meet with major donors\n\nMaximum impact but very time-consuming\n\n\nOption 2: Moderate Visibility\n\n\nAttend opening ceremony (October 1st)\n\nPerhaps 2-3 additional appearances during the two weeks\n\nLet the relics and crusaders do most of the work\n\nBalanced approach\n\n\nOption 3: Low Visibility\n\n\nOpening ceremony only\n\nOtherwise let subordinates manage\n\nFocus your time on Council preparations and other matters\n\nRisk: people might wonder where you are\n\n\n\"In Barcelona, you were visiting as pilgrim-king. Here, you're home in your own city. The expectations might be different. What's your preference?\"\n\n\n\nThe Crusader Clasps - Diego's Report\n\n\nWhile you consider Rodrigo's question, Diego steps forward with his wrapped bundle and ledger.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, you sent me ahead from Barcelona with specifications for the clasps. I engaged three master smiths here in Seville - they've been working for nearly a month.\"\n\n\nHe sets the bundle on the table and opens his ledger. \"Let me first report on costs and status, then show you the work.\"\n\n\nFinancial Accounting:\n\n\nDiego reads from neat columns:\n\n\nCommon Crusader Clasps (Iron):\n\n\nOrdered: 150 pieces\n\nCompleted: 150 pieces\n\nCost: 3 maravedís each = 450 maravedís total\n\nStatus: COMPLETE\n\n\nCommander Clasps (Bronze/Silver):\n\n\nOrdered: 10 pieces\n\nCompleted: 10 pieces\n\nCost: 80 maravedís each = 800 maravedís total\n\nStatus: COMPLETE\n\n\nChaplain Clasps (Silver with book design):\n\n\nOrdered: 10 pieces\n\nCompleted: 8 pieces (2 still in progress)\n\nCost: 50 maravedís each = 500 maravedís total\n\nStatus: MOSTLY COMPLETE (finish by October 5th)\n\n\nPapal Legate Clasp (Gold/Silver, ornate book):\n\n\nOrdered: 1 piece\n\nCompleted: NO - still in progress\n\nCost: 300 maravedís\n\nStatus: IN PROGRESS (finish by October 10th)\n\n\nSupreme Commander Clasp (Your personal clasp):\n\n\nOrdered: 1 piece\n\nMaster smith requested creative freedom\n\nCompleted: YES\n\nCost: 250 maravedís (plus 50 maravedís bonus for exceptional work)\n\nStatus: COMPLETE\n\n\nTotal Expenditure: 2,350 maravedís\n\n\n\"All smiths have been paid half upfront. I owe final payments totaling 1,175 maravedís upon your approval of the work.\"\n\n\n\nViewing the Clasps\n\n\nDiego carefully unwraps the bundle. Inside are wooden boxes lined with cloth. He opens them one by one.\n\n\nThe Common Crusader Clasp:\n\n\nHe holds up a simple iron clasp, about two inches across. The design is clean, functional:\n\n\nIron cross in center\n\nFour arms of equal length\n\n\"GRANADA\" inscribed along the bottom\n\nSimple but dignified\n\nSturdy pin on back for attaching to clothing\n\n\n\"One hundred fifty of these, Your Majesty. Identical. Every common crusader receives one.\"\n\n\nYou examine it. The iron is well-worked, smooth, the inscription clear. Not decorative, but solid. A workman's badge of honor.\n\n\nThe Commander Clasp:\n\n\nBronze with silver inlay, noticeably more ornate:\n\n\nCross in center (larger than common version)\n\nAureole (halo-like circle) surrounding the cross\n\nDecorative flourishes at the cross's ends\n\n\"GRANADA\" inscribed in finer lettering\n\nSlightly larger (2.5 inches across)\n\n\n\"Ten of these, for officers and squadron leaders. The aureole represents divine favor and greater responsibility before God.\"\n\n\nThe bronze catches candlelight beautifully. The silver inlay glints. This is a clasp you'd be proud to wear on formal occasions.\n\n\nThe Chaplain Clasp:\n\n\nSilver, with a completely different design:\n\n\nOpen book in center instead of cross\n\nPages clearly detailed\n\n\"GRANADA\" inscribed below the book\n\nBorder decorated with small crosses at four corners\n\nSame size as commander clasp but distinctly different\n\n\n\"Eight completed, two finishing this week. For priests, confessors, and other chaplains. The book represents Scripture, learning, and spiritual authority distinct from military command.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando, who's been quietly observing, steps closer to examine this one. His face shows genuine emotion. \"Beautiful. Truly beautiful. It honors the sacred duty without militarizing it.\"\n\n\nThe Supreme Commander Clasp - Yours:\n\n\nDiego opens the final small box with visible pride. \"Your Majesty, Master Alonso Ruiz - the finest smith in Seville - requested permission to interpret your specifications creatively. I granted it, with the understanding you could reject it if unsatisfied.\"\n\n\nHe lifts out your personal clasp.\n\n\nIt's stunning.\n\n\nThe Design:\n\n\nSilver-gilt (silver covered in thin gold layer)\n\nAbout 3 inches across - noticeably larger than others\n\nCentral image: A sword pointing downward with cross-shaped hilt\n\nAround the sword: A perfect circle (representing unity, divine perfection)\n\nThe sword blade has microscopic inscription: Non Nobis Domine\n\nAlong the bottom: \"GRANADA\" in elegant letters\n\nFour small stones set at cardinal points - deep red garnets\n\n\nÁlvaro lets out a low whistle. \"By God, that's a work of art.\"\n\n\nDiego explains Master Alonso's thinking: \"He said the sword represents your sacred duty - the blade your father gave you and the crusade you lead. The circle represents God's perfect will and the unity you seek. The downward point suggests both warfare and humility - the sword points to earth, not heaven. The inscription had to be done with magnifying lens. And the garnets...\"\n\n\nDiego grins. \"Master Alonso said they represent the blood that will be shed - both Christ's blood that sanctifies the mission, and the blood of those who fall in service. He thought it important not to make the clasp all bright and shining. The garnets remind: this is holy work, but it's also costly work.\"\n\n\nThe Weight:\n\n\nYou take it in your hand. It's heavier than expected - solid, substantial. This isn't ornament. This is a badge of office that carries weight literally and symbolically.\n\n\nThe craftsmanship is extraordinary. Every detail perfect. The sword's edge is actually sharpened (tiny, but real). The inscription is nearly invisible until light hits it just right, then suddenly readable: Non Nobis Domine.\n\n\n\nThe Reactions\n\n\nRodrigo: \"Your Majesty, that clasp... when you wear that and award the common clasps to the crusaders at the Council, the contrast will be striking. They'll see: their king shares their symbol but carries greater weight.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando: Examining the chaplain clasp again. \"These honor each role appropriately. The crusader's cross, the commander's aureole, the chaplain's book, and yours... yours is its own statement. 'Not unto us, Lord.' Even in your badge of supreme command.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro: \"When you pin these on men at the November Council - sixty to a hundred crusaders all receiving their clasps before the assembled nobility - it's not just ceremony. It's creating an ORDER. Like Santiago or Calatrava, but yours. The Order of Granada, maybe. Or the Order of the White Cross.\"\n\n\nHe looks thoughtful. \"Actually, Your Majesty, have you considered what to call your crusaders collectively? They need a name. 'The King's Crusaders' is functional but uninspired. 'The Order of the White Cross'? 'The Brotherhood of Granada'? Something that will be sung about in ballads?\"\n\n\n\nDiego's Request\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, Master Alonso and the other smiths await your judgment. If you approve the work, I'll make final payments today. If you want changes to any design - particularly your supreme commander clasp - they can make adjustments.\"\n\n\n\"Also, Master Alonso asks: Do you want more common clasps produced? We have one hundred fifty now. If we recruit a hundred more crusaders in the next six weeks, we'll need more. He can produce another hundred by early November if you order them now.\"\n\n\n\nYour Majesty, several questions await your decisions:\n\n\nCathedral Campaign: How visible do you want to be during the two-week display? (High/Moderate/Low visibility?)\n\nThe Clasps: Do you approve the designs, especially your personal supreme commander clasp? Should Diego make final payments?\n\nAdditional Orders: Should more common clasps be produced in anticipation of more recruits?\n\nNaming: What should your crusader force be called? Do you want a formal name, or keep it simple?\n\nThe Papal Legate Clasp: The ornate book-design clasp for the Papal Legate isn't finished yet. Do you want to see it before approval, or trust Master Alonso's work?\n\n\nWhat are your decisions?"

      "say": "Thought process: Strategized Fray Hernando's chaplain recruitment and response plan.\n\nThe user is:\n1. Approving the clasps and ordering 100 more common ones\n2. Thanking the smith\n3. Asking Fray Hernando about recruiting more chaplains/confessors\n\nI should have Fray Hernando respond about his efforts to build a chaplain corps. He's been working on this since Barcelona - mentioned he might recruit 2-3 more chaplains there. Now in Seville, he'd have more opportunities. Let me make this realistic and detailed.\n\n\nBuilding the Chaplain Corps\n\n\nAlcázar of Seville, September 29, 1430 - Late Afternoon\n\n\n\nDiego bows deeply. \"Your Majesty, I'll inform Master Alonso immediately. He'll be honored by your praise and gratitude. The additional hundred common clasps will be ready by early November.\"\n\n\nHe makes a note in his ledger. \"I'll make final payments to all three smiths today. Total disbursement: 1,175 maravedís remaining, plus 300 maravedís for the additional order. I'll record everything properly.\"\n\n\nAs Diego gathers the clasps back into their boxes, Fray Hernando steps forward at your question. His weathered face shows both satisfaction and concern.\n\n\n\nFray Hernando's Report\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I'm pleased to report that I am no longer alone in this sacred duty. The work has grown beyond what one man can manage, and God has provided help.\"\n\n\nHe counts on his fingers. \"In Barcelona, I recruited two additional chaplains:\n\n\nBrother Tomás Rodríguez - Franciscan friar, about thirty years old. Experienced in pastoral work with common people. He has a gift for making complex theological matters understandable to simple men. The crusaders respond well to him.\"\n\n\nFather Miquel Serra - Dominican priest from Barcelona, age forty-five. More scholarly than Brother Tomás, excellent with Latin and canon law. He'll be valuable when we need to navigate Church regulations during the crusade.\"\n\n\n\"Both men sailed with us from Barcelona and are currently working with our sixty-two crusaders here in Seville. They've been hearing confessions, leading prayers, providing spiritual instruction.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando pauses. \"But Your Majesty, sixty-two crusaders require three chaplains working constantly. If we recruit a hundred more - or eventually thousands - we need a proper chaplain corps.\"\n\n\n\nThe Seville Recruitment Effort\n\n\n\"Since arriving in Seville two days ago, I've been approaching religious houses and clergy here. Seville has rich ecclesiastical resources - multiple monasteries, friaries, the cathedral chapter. I've had preliminary conversations with several promising candidates.\"\n\n\nHe pulls out his own notes - less neat than Diego's ledger, but thorough.\n\n\nFirm Commitments (Joining Immediately):\n\n\n\"Father Alfonso de Palencia - Benedictine monk from the Monastery of San Isidoro del Campo, just outside Seville. Age thirty-eight. He's been praying for years about serving in reconquista. When he heard you'd returned with papal crusade bull, he petitioned his abbot for permission. It was granted. He reports tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\"Brother Juan Sánchez - Secular priest from a parish in Triana (Seville's neighborhood across the river). Age thirty-two. Good with common people, experienced in hearing confessions of soldiers and laborers. He's rough around the edges but genuine. Also joins tomorrow.\"\n\n\nStrong Possibilities (In Discussion):\n\n\n\"Father Rodrigo de Córdoba - Augustinian canon, age forty-six. Very learned, speaks Arabic fluently (rare and valuable). He's interested but needs permission from his prior. I'm meeting with the prior this evening.\"\n\n\n\"Brother Pedro Martínez - Another Franciscan, age twenty-eight. Young, energetic, passionate about the crusade. His superior is hesitant about releasing him, but I'm working on it.\"\n\n\n\"Father Luis García - Diocesan priest, age fifty-two. Older, experienced, respected. He wants to join but has parish responsibilities. Bishop of Seville might need to approve and assign replacement. I'm preparing a petition.\"\n\n\nThe Cathedral Chapter:\n\n\n\"I've also approached the Cathedral of Seville's chapter. They're enthusiastic about the crusade but reluctant to release their own clergy permanently. However, they've offered something else:\"\n\n\nFray Hernando looks pleased. \"When we display the relics in the cathedral over the next two weeks, they'll assign rotating chaplains to assist - perhaps eight to ten different priests who'll serve a few days each. They won't join the crusade permanently, but they'll help with confessions, masses, and instruction during the public campaign.\"\n\n\n\"That's valuable for the immediate campaign, even if they don't become permanent crusade chaplains.\"\n\n\n\nCurrent Status and Needs\n\n\nFray Hernando's expression turns more serious.\n\n\n\"Current chaplain strength:\n\n\nMyself (head chaplain)\n\nBrother Tomás Rodríguez (Franciscan)\n\nFather Miquel Serra (Dominican)\n\nThree chaplains total for sixty-two crusaders\n\n\n\"By end of week (October 5th):\n\n\nAdd Father Alfonso (Benedictine)\n\nAdd Brother Juan (secular priest)\n\nFive chaplains total\n\n\n\"Possible additions within two weeks:\n\n\nFather Rodrigo (if Augustinian prior agrees)\n\nBrother Pedro (if Franciscan superior agrees)\n\nFather Luis (if Bishop approves)\n\nPotentially eight chaplains by mid-October\n\n\n\"Plus temporary cathedral assistance during public campaign\"\n\n\n\nThe Ratio Problem\n\n\nFray Hernando explains the mathematics:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, the traditional guidance for armies is one chaplain per one hundred men. That's for regular armies. For a crusade - where spiritual welfare is paramount - I'd recommend one chaplain per fifty to seventy-five crusaders.\"\n\n\nHe calculates: \"If we recruit aggressively and reach two hundred crusaders by November Council, we'd need three to four chaplains minimum, ideally six to eight.\"\n\n\n\"If the crusade eventually grows to two thousand men, we'd need twenty-five to forty chaplains. That's a substantial chaplain corps - nearly the size of a monastery.\"\n\n\nThe Challenge:\n\n\n\"Recruiting chaplains is harder than recruiting soldiers, Your Majesty. Most priests and monks are bound by their orders or parishes. They need permission from superiors to leave. Some abbots and priors are reluctant to release their best men.\"\n\n\n\"Also, not every priest is suited for crusade. They need to be:\n\n\nPhysically capable of campaign life (not too old or infirm)\n\nSpiritually strong (will witness terrible things)\n\nPractically minded (battlefield confession is different from parish work)\n\nCommitted to your vision of mercy and justice, not just slaughter\n\n\n\"Many excellent parish priests would be terrible crusade chaplains, and vice versa.\"\n\n\n\nFray Hernando's Requests\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I have several requests to help build the chaplain corps properly:\"\n\n\n1. Formal Authority:\n\n\n\"I need your authorization to recruit chaplains officially on behalf of the crusade. A letter with your royal seal that I can show to abbots, priors, and bishops. It should say something like: 'Father Hernando de Talavera acts with our authority as head chaplain of the Crusade for Granada. Religious superiors are requested to give serious consideration to releasing suitable clergy for this sacred work.'\"\n\n\n\"That doesn't compel them - they still have final say - but it shows they're not defying the King if they release their men.\"\n\n\n2. Financial Support:\n\n\n\"Some clergy will come with support from their orders. Others - particularly secular priests without monastic backing - will need support. They can't take pay like soldiers (vow of poverty), but they need:\n\n\nBasic necessities (food, clothing, shelter - provided by crusade)\n\nMaterials for sacraments (wine, bread, oils, candles)\n\nBooks (missals, Bibles, theological texts)\n\nWriting materials for records\n\n\n\"I estimate 20-30 maravedís per month per chaplain for these necessities. For eight chaplains, that's 160-240 maravedís monthly. Not a large expense compared to soldiers' wages, but it needs to be budgeted.\"\n\n\n3. The Chaplain Clasps:\n\n\n\"The silver book clasps Diego showed us - those are perfect. They honor chaplains' distinct role while making clear we're part of the crusade. When you award clasps at the November Council, including chaplains publicly shows you value spiritual mission as much as military.\"\n\n\n\"I'd like to formally present the chaplains to the Council, similar to how you'll present the crusader soldiers. Let the nobility see: this crusade has spiritual infrastructure, not just swords.\"\n\n\n4. Physical Space:\n\n\n\"When the crusade actually marches, chaplains need:\n\n\nA tent or designated space for confessions (private, quiet)\n\nStorage for sacred items and sacramental materials\n\nAccess to the banner and relics for daily Mass\n\nProtection from being ordered away by military commanders (which your clasp system already addresses - thank you for that)\n\n\n\"Nothing elaborate. Just recognition that spiritual work requires some physical accommodation.\"\n\n\n\nBrother Tomás and Father Miquel\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, would you like to meet the two chaplains from Barcelona? They're here in the Alcázar working with the crusaders. I could summon them.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro interjects: \"Actually, Your Majesty, that might be worthwhile. You've met Fray Hernando extensively, but these other chaplains will be representing you spiritually to hundreds or thousands of crusaders. You should know them, and they should know you beyond just hearing about you.\"\n\n\nRodrigo adds: \"The crusaders talk about 'Father Hernando' constantly. He's already a figure of respect and even affection. Brother Tomás is becoming similar - the men call him 'Brother Tomás the Kind' because he's so patient with their struggles. Father Miquel they respect but find a bit intimidating - very learned, very proper. But all three work well together.\"\n\n\n\nThe Larger Question\n\n\nFray Hernando looks at you seriously. \"Your Majesty, building a proper chaplain corps will take months. We can have eight by mid-October, maybe twelve by November if I work hard. But eventually reaching twenty-five to forty for a full crusading army? That's a year-long effort.\"\n\n\n\"The question is: How quickly do you expect the crusade to grow? If you plan to march on Granada with two hundred men by spring 1431, we can manage with eight to ten chaplains. If you plan to recruit thousands over the next year before marching, I need to start building toward twenty-five to forty chaplains now.\"\n\n\n\"What's your timeline, Your Majesty? That helps me plan the chaplain recruitment accordingly.\"\n\n\n\nYour Majesty, Fray Hernando awaits your responses:\n\n\nShould he receive formal authorization letter to recruit chaplains?\n\nFinancial support approved for chaplain necessities? (160-240 maravedís monthly for eight chaplains)\n\nShould he present chaplains formally at November Council alongside crusader soldiers?\n\nDo you want to meet Brother Tomás and Father Miquel now?\n\nWhat's your expected timeline for crusade growth? (This helps him plan chaplain recruitment pace)\n\n\nAlso, Álvaro reminds: \"Your Majesty, we still need your decision on the cathedral campaign visibility. How present do you want to be during the two-week relic display?\""

Cathedral help: Juan is hesitant to accept rotating cathedral chaplains who aren't sworn crusaders - he wants message control and unity of vision.

Full support for Fray Hernando: Tents, equipment, recruitment letter, complete trust.\n\n5. Fray Hernando as highest spiritual authority until Papal Legate arrives.\n\n6.

He's silent for a moment, considering the implications.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I understand your concern about unity of message. It's wise. Very wise.\"\n\n\nHe begins pacing slowly, hands clasped behind his back - his thinking posture, similar to Álvaro's.\n\n\nThe Cathedral Chaplain Question\n\n\n\"You're right to be cautious about accepting rotating cathedral assistance. Let me explain what I was seeing as the benefit, and why your concern might be more important.\"\n\n\nThe Advantage I Saw:\n\n\n\"Cathedral chaplains would help manage the enormous workload during the two-week public campaign. Hundreds of people wanting confession, spiritual counsel, blessings. We'd be overwhelmed with just our small chaplain corps.\"\n\n\nBut Your Concern Is Valid:\n\n\n\"However... you're absolutely right that we've developed specific theological emphases that not all clergy share.\"\n\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\n\"We teach:\n\n\nMercy toward surrendered Muslims, not slaughter\n\nConversion of the heart, not forced baptism at swordpoint\n\nProtection of the conquered who accept peace\n\nJustice that includes compassion\n\nThat crusaders can commit sins even in holy war\n\n\n\"Many clergy teach:\n\n\nAll infidels deserve death\n\nForced conversion is acceptable if it saves souls\n\nPlunder and violence are rewards for crusaders\n\nAny act against Muslims is automatically righteous\n\nCrusaders are beyond sin when fighting God's enemies\n\n\n\"If cathedral chaplains during the public campaign tell potential crusaders: 'Join this holy war and kill all the Moors!' - while we're teaching something more nuanced - that creates confusion and contradiction.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando stops pacing, looks at you directly.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I withdraw my suggestion about cathedral assistance. You're right. We should maintain doctrinal consistency even if it means more work for our small chaplain corps. Better to be overwhelmed but unified than well-staffed but contradictory.\"\n\n\n\nSpiritual Men Among Current Crusaders\n\n\nFray Hernando's face brightens. \"Your Majesty, yes! There are indeed men of deep faith among our current crusaders. I should have thought of this myself.\"\n\n\nHe pulls out his notes. \"From Barcelona, there's Brother Guillem - the Benedictine monk, age twenty-eight. You met him briefly. He's educated, devout, handles weapons well despite monastic background. The men already seek his spiritual counsel naturally.\"\n\n\n\"Brother Guillem took crusader vows like the others, but he's essentially a monk who fights. With proper training and authorization, he could serve as chaplain while also being a crusader. It's unusual - most chaplains don't fight - but there's precedent. Some Military Orders have monk-knights who both fight and minister.\"\n\n\nThe Advantage:\n\n\n\"Brother Guillem already understands our message because he's lived it for six weeks. He's heard our teachings, been part of the crusader formation, knows the culture we're building. He wouldn't contradict or confuse.\"\n\n\n\"Also, crusaders trust him more readily because he's one of them. He wears the white tabard, took the same vows, eats at the same campfires. A chaplain who's also a crusader has credibility that outside clergy lack.\"\n\n\nOther Possibilities:\n\n\n\"Giovanni Rossi - the old blacksmith from Florence. He's deeply devout, prays constantly, but... he's not educated. Can barely read Latin. He could lead prayers and provide simple spiritual counsel, but not hear confessions or celebrate Mass. He'd need years of training to become proper priest.\"\n\n\n\"Tomás García - the converso from Barcelona. Passionate about faith, asks good theological questions, but again - not ordained, not trained. Potential for future, but not immediate.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando looks thoughtful. \"Your Majesty, here's an idea: We could create two categories of spiritual leadership within the crusade:\"\n\n\n1. Ordained Chaplains (Priests and Monks):\n\n\nCan hear confessions, celebrate Mass, give absolution\n\nWear the silver book clasps\n\nFull spiritual authority\n\nDon't fight (or fight only in extreme defense)\n\n\n2. Lay Spiritual Leaders (Devout Crusaders):\n\n\nLead prayers, provide counsel, model faith\n\nStill fight as crusaders\n\nWear special version of common clasp? (Perhaps iron with small cross added?)\n\nBridge between chaplains and common soldiers\n\n\n\"Brother Guillem could be the first ordained chaplain who's also a crusader - unique hybrid. Giovanni could be lay spiritual leader. That gives us flexibility while maintaining unity of message.\"\n\n\n\nThe Full Support Package\n\n\nÁlvaro steps forward, already thinking practically. \"Your Majesty, let me organize what Fray Hernando needs. I'll have it ready within a week.\"\n\n\nHe begins listing:\n\n\nPhysical Resources:\n\n\n\"Tents:\n\n\nOne large chaplain tent for confessions and spiritual counsel (10' x 10')\n\nStorage tent for sacred items and materials (8' x 8')\n\nPersonal tents for each chaplain (standard crusader tents)\n\n\n\"Sacramental Supplies:\n\n\nWine, bread, oils for sacraments\n\nCandles, incense\n\nPortable altar that can be set up quickly\n\nReliquary cases for protecting sacred items during travel\n\nVestments for celebrating Mass\n\n\n\"Books and Materials:\n\n\nMissals for each chaplain\n\nBible (expensive but essential)\n\nWriting materials for keeping spiritual records\n\nWax tablets for notes and confessions scheduling\n\n\n\"Budget:\n\n\n240 maravedís monthly for eight chaplains' necessities\n\n500 maravedís one-time expense for tents and equipment\n\nOngoing supply of sacramental materials\n\n\n\"Total startup cost: ~800 maravedís. Monthly ongoing: 240 maravedís.\"\n\n\nThe Authorization Letter:\n\n\n\"I'll draft a formal letter, Your Majesty. Something like:\"\n\n\n\nTo All Abbots, Priors, Bishops, and Superiors of Religious Orders,\n\n\nBe it known that Fray Hernando de Talavera, Hieronymite monk, serves as HEAD CHAPLAIN of the Crusade for Granada, commissioned by His Holiness Pope Martin V through the crusade bull Inter Cetera Divinae Providentiae.\n\n\nUntil such time as the Papal Legate arrives, Fray Hernando holds supreme spiritual authority within the crusade, answering only to the Holy Father and to us.\n\n\nHe is authorized to recruit suitable clergy for service as crusade chaplains. We request that religious superiors give serious and favorable consideration to releasing men of faith and capability for this sacred work.\n\n\nFray Hernando represents both our crown and the papal commission. His word carries our full authority in spiritual matters pertaining to the crusade.\n\n\nJuan II, King of Castile and León\n\n\n\n\"That gives him the authority he needs while establishing his position clearly.\"\n\n\n\nThe Papal Legate Question\n\n\nFray Hernando looks concerned. \"Your Majesty, that's an excellent question and one I should have addressed earlier.\"\n\n\n\"The papal bull specifies that a Papal Legate will be appointed to accompany the crusade for spiritual oversight. But the bull doesn't name who that will be, nor when they'll arrive.\"\n\n\nWhat We Know:\n\n\n\"Pope Martin V is seventy-two and in declining health. Appointing a legate requires:\n\n\nSelection of appropriate cardinal or archbishop\n\nThat person accepting the assignment (some might refuse - crusades are dangerous and uncomfortable)\n\nOrganizing their retinue and travel\n\nActually traveling from Rome to Castile\n\n\n\"This process takes months, potentially six months to a year.\"\n\n\nWhat We Don't Know:\n\n\n\"Has the Pope already appointed someone? Is that person en route? Or is the selection still being deliberated?\"\n\n\nFray Hernando spreads his hands. \"Your Majesty, we have no information. The papal bull was issued August 1st. It's now late September. Even if the Pope appointed someone immediately, the legate might not arrive until late 1430 or early 1431.\"\n\n\nHow to Find Out:\n\n\n\"I suggest writing directly to Cardinal Giordano Orsini in Rome. He's the Pope's closest advisor - he would know. Ask:\n\n\nHas a Papal Legate been appointed?\n\nIf so, who and when do they expect to arrive?\n\nIf not, what's the timeline for appointment?\n\n\n\"We should know this before we actually march on Granada. The legate is supposed to provide spiritual oversight - prevent excesses, ensure crusade remains true to Christian principles. Having them arrive mid-campaign would be awkward.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro adds: \"That letter could go with our next dispatch to Rome. Or we could send a separate fast messenger specifically for this question. Your choice, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\n\nBrother Guillem - The Monk-Crusader\n\n\nFray Hernando returns to the practical question. \"Your Majesty, regarding Brother Guillem specifically - he's an ordained Benedictine monk. He can hear confessions and celebrate Mass. With your authorization, I could formally appoint him as crusade chaplain while he continues to serve as crusader.\"\n\n\n\"This would be unusual - most chaplains don't fight. But there's precedent in the Military Orders. And it sends a powerful message: even our spiritual leaders are willing to shed blood for this cause if necessary.\"\n\n\n\"Should I speak with Brother Guillem about this? He'd need to accept the dual role. Some monks would refuse - 'I took vows of peace, I can't serve as warrior.' But Guillem came to Barcelona precisely to fight. He might embrace the hybrid role.\"\n\n\n\nMeeting the Chaplains\n\n\nRodrigo clears his throat. \"Your Majesty, Brother Tomás and Father Miquel are nearby if you want to meet them. They're with the crusaders in the courtyard, leading afternoon prayers.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro glances at the sun through the window. \"It's getting late in the day, Your Majesty. We still need to discuss your visibility during the cathedral campaign. But meeting your chaplains would only take a few minutes if you want to do it now.\"\n\n\n\nThe Cathedral Campaign Visibility - Still Pending\n\n\nÁlvaro gently reminds: \"Your Majesty, Rodrigo needs guidance on the cathedral campaign. He's ready to finalize arrangements with the cathedral chapter, but needs to know: How involved will you be during the two weeks?\"\n\n\nHe recaps the options:\n\n\nHigh Visibility:\n\n\nDaily Mass attendance\n\nMultiple speeches/addresses\n\nPersonal meetings with donors\n\nVery time-consuming but maximum impact\n\n\nModerate Visibility:\n\n\nOpening ceremony (October 1st)\n\n2-3 additional appearances\n\nBalanced approach\n\n\nLow Visibility:\n\n\nOpening ceremony only\n\nFocus time on Council preparations\n\nRisk people wonder where you are\n\n\n\"In Barcelona you were moderate - opening plus a few appearances. In Florence you were high - that famous speech in the piazza. Here in Seville, your own city, the expectations might be different. What's your preference?\"\n\n\n\nYour Majesty, several matters await decisions:\n\n\nShould Fray Hernando approach Brother Guillem about serving as monk-crusader chaplain?\n\nThe two-tier system of ordained chaplains plus lay spiritual leaders - do you approve this structure?\n\nLetter to Cardinal Orsini asking about Papal Legate - send it? (Via next regular dispatch or special fast messenger?)\n\nMeet Brother Tomás and Father Miquel now, or handle that later?\n\nCathedral campaign visibility - High/Moderate/Low?\n\n\nWhat are your decisions?"

      "say": "Thought process: Strategized organizational development for crusader spiritual support roles.\n\nThe user is making a smart organizational decision - creating a middle tier of spiritual support within the crusaders. This is historically appropriate and tactically wise. Let me:\n\n1. Have Diego acknowledge the order for the new \"learned crusader\" clasps\n2. Create a meaningful scene meeting the chaplains (Brother Tomás and Father Miquel)\n3. Show Juan explaining his vision to them\n4. Then return to the council to discuss the cathedral campaign\n\nThis is good character development - Juan is building his organization thoughtfully, meeting his people personally, and showing leadership.\n\n\nThe Learned Crusaders and Meeting the Chaplains\n\n\nAlcázar of Seville, September 29, 1430 - Late Afternoon\n\n\n\nCreating the New Role\n\n\nFray Hernando's face lights up with understanding. \"Your Majesty, that's brilliant. A middle tier - crusaders who serve as spiritual anchors without being full chaplains. Brothers helping brothers.\"\n\n\nDiego immediately pulls out his notes. \"A clasp between common and chaplain designs. Let me think...\"\n\n\nHe sketches quickly. \"Perhaps:\n\n\nIron base (like common crusaders)\n\nCross design (like common crusaders)\n\nBut with small open book added beside the cross (referencing chaplain symbol)\n\nOr a cross with radiating lines suggesting wisdom/learning\n\n\"GRANADA\" inscription as always\n\nSlightly larger than common clasp but smaller than chaplain clasp\n\n\n\"Twenty pieces. I'll commission them from Master Alonso - he'll understand the symbolism. Cost: probably 15-20 maravedís each, so 300-400 maravedís total. Ready by early November with everything else.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro nods approvingly. \"Learned Crusaders. I like it. Gives spiritual support structure without requiring ordained priests. And it creates aspiration - crusaders will want to earn that distinction.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"Brother Guillem would be perfect for this. Giovanni Rossi. Tomás García eventually. And as we recruit more, we'll identify others. Men of faith and wisdom who can counsel their brothers on matters that don't require sacraments - doubts, fears, homesickness, moral questions, conflicts between men.\"\n\n\n\"Most soldiers' spiritual struggles aren't theological. They're human. 'I'm afraid of dying.' 'I miss my family.' 'I'm angry at that man for insulting me.' A wise older brother can address these as well as a priest, sometimes better.\"\n\n\nRodrigo speaks up: \"Your Majesty, the crusaders will value this. Many men are more comfortable talking to another soldier than approaching Father Hernando formally. This creates... permission to seek help.\"\n\n\n\nMeeting the Chaplains\n\n\nYou stand. \"Take me to them. I want to meet these men who'll guard my crusaders' souls.\"\n\n\nRodrigo leads the way through corridors and down to the main courtyard. The late afternoon sun casts long shadows. You can hear voices - the crusaders at afternoon prayers.\n\n\nThe Courtyard Scene\n\n\nAbout fifty of your sixty-two crusaders are assembled in rough formation. White tabards gleaming in the sunlight, red crosses vivid. They're kneeling on the stones while two figures lead them in prayer.\n\n\nThe first is a short, stocky man in brown Franciscan robes with a crusader's white tabard worn over them - an unusual combination. His voice is warm, patient, leading them through the Pater Noster in Latin, then repeating in Castilian for those who don't know Latin.\n\n\nThe second is taller, lean, severe-looking, in black Dominican robes. He stands slightly apart, hands clasped, watching the crusaders with sharp intelligent eyes.\n\n\nBrother Tomás notices your arrival first. He doesn't interrupt the prayer, but his eyes widen slightly. He brings the prayer to its natural conclusion: \"...sed libera nos a malo. Amen.\"\n\n\n\"AMEN,\" sixty voices echo.\n\n\n\"Brothers,\" Tomás says gently, \"His Majesty honors us with his presence. Rise.\"\n\n\nThe crusaders scramble to their feet, turning toward you. You see faces you recognize - Marco, Pietro, Andrea, Giovanni the blacksmith. Others are newer recruits from Barcelona. All look at you with varying degrees of awe, respect, devotion.\n\n\nFray Hernando steps forward. \"Your Majesty, may I present Brother Tomás Rodríguez, Franciscan friar from Catalonia, and Father Miquel Serra, Dominican priest from Barcelona. These are the chaplains who accompanied us from your sister's city.\"\n\n\n\nBrother Tomás Rodríguez\n\n\nThe Franciscan approaches and bows - not the deep formal bow of a courtier, but the simpler bow of a humble friar. He's perhaps thirty, with a round friendly face, thinning brown hair, and warm brown eyes. His hands are calloused - this is a man who's worked with them.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am deeply honored.\" His Castilian is accented - Catalan underneath. \"I have prayed for this moment since hearing of your call in Barcelona.\"\n\n\nYou gesture for him to rise. \"Father Hernando speaks highly of you. He says the crusaders call you 'Brother Tomás the Kind.'\"\n\n\nTomás blushes, looking embarrassed. \"The men are generous with titles I haven't earned, Your Majesty. I simply... I try to listen. So many of them carry burdens they've never spoken aloud. A willing ear and a kind word - that's all most need. God does the real work.\"\n\n\n\"Tell me about yourself, Brother Tomás. Why did you join this crusade?\"\n\n\nThe Franciscan's expression grows more serious. \"Your Majesty, I've served as friar in Barcelona for eight years. Good work - tending to the poor, hearing confessions, celebrating Mass. But I heard Saint Francis's call to something more.\"\n\n\nHe hesitates, choosing words carefully. \"Many in the Church speak of crusade as glorious violence. Kill the infidels, take their lands, win heaven through the sword. That never sat well with me. Saint Francis himself went to Egypt during crusade and spoke with the Sultan peacefully. He saw Muslims as souls to be saved, not just enemies to be killed.\"\n\n\n\"Then in Barcelona, I heard Father Hernando preach about your crusade. About mercy for those who surrender. About conversion of hearts, not forced baptism. About treating conquered Muslims justly. And I thought: 'This is what Saint Francis would want. A crusade that seeks to save souls, not just spill blood.'\"\n\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"So I asked my superior for permission to join. He gave it. And here I am, Your Majesty, trying to help these good men stay true to Christian virtue even in the midst of war.\"\n\n\nYou ask: \"And do you find it difficult? Teaching mercy while training men for violence?\"\n\n\nBrother Tomás smiles sadly. \"Every day, Your Majesty. Some crusaders understand immediately. Others struggle - they want to hate the enemy, it makes fighting easier. My work is helping them see: you can fight an enemy without hating them. You can take a life in war without delighting in it. You can be a soldier and still be a Christian.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to the crusaders behind him. \"These men - they're trying, Your Majesty. They stumble, they doubt, they sometimes fail. But they're trying. That's all God asks.\"\n\n\n\nFather Miquel Serra\n\n\nThe Dominican approaches with more formal bearing. He's perhaps forty-five, tall and thin, with angular features and piercing grey eyes. His bow is precise, proper. Everything about him suggests discipline and learning.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am honored beyond words to serve in this sacred endeavor.\" His Castilian is perfect, educated, no trace of Catalan accent. \"Father Hernando has spoken of your vision at length. I find it theologically sound and practically wise.\"\n\n\n\"Tell me about yourself, Father Miquel. What brings a Dominican scholar to crusade?\"\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I taught at the studium in Barcelona for fifteen years. Theology, canon law, philosophy. Important work, but... theoretical. I spent my days debating fine points of doctrine with other scholars while the world outside continued as it was.\"\n\n\nHis expression is stern but not unkind. \"When I heard of your crusade - with papal backing, with relics of the True Cross and Santiago, with a young king willing to attempt what seemed impossible - I felt conviction I hadn't felt in years. This wasn't just another academic exercise. This was real. This mattered.\"\n\n\n\"I requested permission from my order. They were reluctant - they valued my teaching. But I argued: 'What good is theological knowledge if it remains in books and lecture halls? Let me apply it in the world, in service of holy work.' Eventually they agreed.\"\n\n\nYou ask: \"Father Hernando says you're valuable for understanding Church law and regulations. Why is that important for a crusade?\"\n\n\nFather Miquel's grey eyes sharpen. \"Your Majesty, crusades operate under complex canon law. When we conquer a city, how do we treat Muslim property? Can we seize mosque endowments? What about Jews? If a Muslim converts under duress, is the baptism valid? If a crusader commits atrocity, who has jurisdiction to punish - you as military commander or the Church?\"\n\n\n\"These aren't abstract questions. They arise constantly. Without proper canonical guidance, crusades descend into chaos where every commander makes his own rules. I'm here to help ensure we follow Church law, not contradict it.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Also, Your Majesty, I speak some Arabic. Not fluently, but enough. If we need to negotiate with Muslim leaders, communicate terms of surrender, understand their religious law - I can help. Few Christian clergy study Arabic. I did, because I believe understanding our adversaries makes us more effective at converting them.\"\n\n\n\"And the Papal Legate, when he arrives - he'll need detailed records of everything we've done, every decision made, to ensure all was proper. I'm keeping those records.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking with Both\n\n\nYou address them together. \"Father Hernando tells me you work well as a team despite different approaches.\"\n\n\nBrother Tomás grins. \"Your Majesty, Father Miquel keeps me from being too soft. I keep him from being too rigid. It's a good balance.\"\n\n\nFather Miquel's severe face softens slightly. \"Brother Tomás has the common touch I lack. The crusaders tell him things they'd never tell me. I provide the canonical framework he sometimes forgets. We complement each other.\"\n\n\nYou explain your vision more fully:\n\n\n\"I want this crusade to be different. Not just in tactics or strategy, but in character. Most crusades become excuses for plunder and violence dressed in holy language. I want ours to genuinely serve God's purposes - which means mercy, justice, genuine conversion, not just conquest.\"\n\n\n\"That's harder. It requires constant vigilance. Soldiers in the heat of battle will want to commit atrocities. Commanders will want to allow plunder to keep men motivated. Nobles will push for forced conversions to claim credit. Every day, there will be pressure to compromise our principles.\"\n\n\n\"Your role - all three of you, with Father Hernando - is to be the conscience of this crusade. To remind us of what we're really fighting for. To stop us when we're about to do something that serves our interests but betrays God's. Can you do that?\"\n\n\nBrother Tomás: \"Your Majesty, with God's help, yes. Though we'll need your support when we must say difficult things.\"\n\n\nFather Miquel: \"Your Majesty, I can be... uncompromising about canon law. Some commanders won't appreciate being told they cannot do something they want to do. If you truly mean this, you must be prepared to back us even when it's inconvenient.\"\n\n\n\"I will. And I'm creating a system to protect you.\" You explain the chaplain clasps, the independent authority, the guarantee that no commander can prevent chaplains from going where needed or speaking what must be said.\n\n\nBoth men look moved.\n\n\nFather Miquel: \"Your Majesty, I've studied crusade history extensively. What you're describing - independent chaplain authority, genuine commitment to mercy, limiting excesses - this is unprecedented. Most crusade leaders give lip service to these ideals then ignore them when convenient. You're building actual structure to enforce them.\"\n\n\nBrother Tomás: \"It won't be perfect, Your Majesty. We're all sinners. We'll all fail sometimes. But you're trying. You're building something better. That's... that's what God asks of us.\"\n\n\n\nThe Crusaders' Perspective\n\n\nYou notice the crusaders have been watching this conversation. Marco, the experienced mercenary, steps forward hesitantly.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, permission to speak?\"\n\n\n\"Granted.\"\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, the men... we talk about this sometimes. About what makes this crusade different. Most of us have heard the stories - other crusades where it was just killing and plunder with a cross painted on. We didn't join for that.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to his brothers. \"We joined because you said it would be different. Because you talked about mercy and justice. Because Father Hernando and Brother Tomás and Father Miquel teach us things that... that make us want to be better men, not just better killers.\"\n\n\nPietro, the young Florentine, adds: \"Your Majesty, Brother Tomás heard my confession last week. I told him I was afraid - afraid of dying, afraid of killing, afraid I'd fail you. He said: 'Being afraid makes you human. Admitting it makes you honest. Fighting anyway makes you brave.' That... that helped me more than any sermon about glory and honor.\"\n\n\nGiovanni, the old blacksmith, speaks in his rough voice: \"Your Majesty, I'm a simple man. Don't understand theology. But Father Miquel explained to me: 'When we conquer Granada, we're not destroying their souls, we're saving them.' That made sense. I can fight for that. Couldn't fight just for land or gold.\"\n\n\nYou see the impact these three chaplains have already had on your small crusader force. They're not just hearing confessions - they're shaping the moral culture of your army.\n\n\n\nReturning to Council\n\n\nAfter spending time with the crusaders and chaplains - perhaps twenty minutes of conversation, questions, getting to know these men - you return to your private chambers with Álvaro, Fray Hernando, and Rodrigo.\n\n\nThe sun is lower now. Evening approaches.\n\n\nÁlvaro pours wine for everyone. \"Your Majesty, that was well done. Those chaplains needed to meet you personally, and you needed to see how they work with the crusaders. They're good men.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando looks pleased. \"Brother Tomás and Father Miquel have been invaluable. With the learned crusader tier you just created, we'll have strong spiritual infrastructure.\"\n\n\n\nThe Cathedral Campaign - Final Decision\n\n\nRodrigo returns to the pending question. \"Your Majesty, I need to finalize arrangements with the Cathedral of Seville for the two-week campaign. The question remains: how visible will you be?\"\n\n\nHe lays out the practical considerations:\n\n\nThe Arguments for High Visibility:\n\n\n\"This is your city, your power base. The nobles who were lukewarm at yesterday's assembly - their wives, families, merchant partners, all live here. If you're highly visible during the campaign, they'll hear about it constantly. 'The King attended Mass again this morning. The King spoke movingly about the crusade. The King personally blessed crusaders.'\"\n\n\n\"Also, recruiting will be stronger if you're present regularly. Men join to serve YOU, not just a cause. If you're visible, applications will double or triple.\"\n\n\n\"Finally, donations. Major merchants and nobles are more likely to contribute if they see you personally committed. It's one thing to donate to a campaign. It's another to donate while the King watches and thanks you personally.\"\n\n\nThe Arguments for Moderate Visibility:\n\n\n\"You have many other responsibilities - Council preparations, diplomatic correspondence, managing kingdom business. You can't spend twelve hours daily at the cathedral.\"\n\n\n\"Also, if you're there constantly, you might become... ordinary. If you appear selectively - opening ceremony, a few key moments, closing ceremony - each appearance becomes an event. Scarcity creates impact.\"\n\n\n\"This gives you time for other crucial work while still showing commitment.\"\n\n\nThe Arguments for Low Visibility:\n\n\n\"Opening ceremony makes the statement: 'The King blesses this campaign.' Then you let it run itself. Shows confidence in your subordinates. Frees your time completely for Council preparation, diplomatic matters, military planning.\"\n\n\n\"Risk: people might interpret absence as lack of commitment. 'If the crusade is so important, why isn't the King there?'\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's Opinion:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I recommend moderate visibility with strategic timing. Be present for:\n\n\nOpening ceremony (October 1st) - Major speech, unveiling the banner, first display of relics\n\nMid-campaign appearance (October 7th) - Shows sustained commitment\n\nMajor donor recognition (October 10th) - Thank major contributors publicly\n\nClosing ceremony (October 14th) - Final blessing, announce recruitment results\n\n\n\"Four appearances over two weeks. Each one significant. Between them, you handle other business. Best of both worlds.\"\n\n\nRodrigo's Tactical Addition:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, one more thing. If you choose moderate or low visibility, your sixty-two crusaders become more important. They're YOUR soldiers, wearing YOUR white tabards. If they're visible constantly - training in public squares, guarding the relics, marching through streets - people see your crusade is real even when you're not physically present.\"\n\n\n\"I could organize daily public drills. Crusaders training with swords and pikes in the plaza outside the cathedral. Crowds gather, watch, get excited. Men see it and want to join. It becomes entertainment and recruitment simultaneously.\"\n\n\n\nYour Majesty, several final decisions:\n\n\nCathedral campaign visibility: High, Moderate (Álvaro's four-appearance plan), or Low?\n\nIf you choose speeches/appearances, what themes should you emphasize?\n\n\nThe papal blessing and divine mandate?\n\nMercy and justice in conquest?\n\nUnity of the kingdom?\n\nCall for recruits and donations?\n\nPublic crusader training drills - Should Rodrigo organize these for daily visibility?\n\nShould you attend opening ceremony tomorrow (October 1st)? The cathedral can be ready by tomorrow morning if you want to launch immediately, or wait a day or two for more preparation.\n\n\nWhat are your decisions?"

Not just occasional sermons.\n\nYour personal involvement: They've met you, heard your vision directly, touched the True Cross.\n\nMany came specifically for the message: Marco seeking redemption from mercenary past, Brother Guillem's sincere faith, Giovanni's simple devotion.\n\nGood treatment: Fair pay, proper equipment, respect. Reduces resentment that breeds cynicism.\n\nHaven't been corrupted yet: No campaign experience to test and break their ideals.\n\n\nWorking against you:\n\n\nThey're still human: Even sincere men struggle with virtue under pressure.\n\nShort time together: Only 6-8 weeks since Barcelona recruitment.\n\nNo combat test: Easy to be virtuous in training.

Not everyone came for holy reasons.\n\nMilitary culture: Soldiers traditionally expect plunder, violence, \"spoils of war.\"\n\n\n\nMy assessment: LIKELY TO SUCCEED\n\n\nMost of your crusaders are genuinely committed to the vision you've articulated. The spiritual infrastructure you've built is working. But it's not universal or perfect - some struggle more than others, some joined for less pure reasons, and even the most devout will face temptations.\n\n\nIf you succeed with this roll, you'll find your core message has genuinely taken root in most of your force. If you fail, you'll discover more cynicism, lip service, or misunderstanding than you hoped.\n\n\n\nRoll and tell me the result: Great Success, Success, Failure, or Catastrophic Failure."

With \"Likely to Succeed\" probability and a Success outcome, I should describe that the crusaders are genuinely committed to Juan's vision, though not perfectly. The spiritual infrastructure is working well. Most crusaders have internalized the core message about mercy, justice, and genuine conversion rather than just plunder and violence.\n\nI should keep this brief as the user requested, and focus on what Juan observes/discovers rather than lengthy analysis.\n\n\nThe Crusaders' True Faith\n\n\nAlcázar of Seville, September 30, 1430 - Morning\n\n\n\nOver the next few hours, you quietly observe your crusaders - at morning prayers, during training, in casual conversation. You listen without announcing yourself, watch how they behave when they don't know you're present.\n\n\nWhat you discover:\n\n\nMost of them genuinely believe. Marco leads prayers with real conviction, not performance. Giovanni weeps during confession with Brother Tomás - actual spiritual struggle, not show. Pietro argues passionately with another recruit about whether forced conversion counts as saving souls, citing what Father Miquel taught. Andrea asks Brother Guillem earnest questions about fear and sin.\n\n\nThey're not perfect. You overhear two newer recruits joking crudely about Moorish women, until Marco sharply corrects them: \"That's not what we're here for. Remember your vows.\" One man grumbles about the pay being lower than mercenary work, though he doesn't leave.\n\n\nBut the core message has taken root. When they speak of the crusade among themselves, they use your language - mercy for surrendered enemies, conversion not slaughter, justice alongside victory. They repeat Fray Hernando's teachings. They correct each other when someone strays from the vision.\n\n\nIt's real. Not universal, not perfect, but real.\n\n\nYour spiritual infrastructure is working."

Assess how likely I am to succeed based on the following speech I give without describing the actual outcome.\n\n\nI signal the trumpets to announce my presence and step into the podium to adress the crowd.\n\n\nPeople of Sevilla, my Castillians!\n\n\nHow joyous it is to see you all on this fine day. Long have I been from home but being back home among my countrymen feels great.\n\n\nWhen I left, I did so because I felt compelled to do so. A feeling, or a pull I could not describe at the time. A need to go out on a spiritual journey even I did not know the way. This journey has led me through many lands, places and holy sites, ending in Rome.\n\n\nI think most of you have heard about my meeting with the pope and what happened next. It was the most profound experience of my life and I have since then been filled with purpose and holy zeal. You know of what I speak! The reconquista! Glory to God! And an end to the suffering and strife you have known for so long. Victory is within our reach. It has been for some time, but with the holy father's blessing, we have the sacred task before us. And the pope has seen fit to not only bless me, bless the crusade, but he has also entrusted me with the full power of the church and it's relics to bring the word of Christ to Grenada!\n\n\nBehold, the banner of the white cross, carrying with it, a fragment of the cross of our lord Jesus Christ.\n\n\nI let the banner be unfurled and the relics displayed. I dare not touch them, but give the audience a moment to regard them.\n\n\nWe are humble and small creatures before almighty God. We have fears, and doubts. I know I do! But there are a few things that are unshakable within me. I have been given this sacred charge and I will not rest until the reconquista is complete or until I have given myself body and soul to this endeavour. I will succeed or I will die trying.\n\n\nWe must all do what we can. For some this will mean offering shelter crusaders of those seeking to join. For others it means donating bread they can spare. Those with wealth can offer that. And those very few who are rightful christians and of sound body can join my crusade themself and be  a part of my crusaders.\n\n\nI gesture to the assembled crusader force.\n\n\nMy people. We are all servants. We are united in this one goal as christians. We are united because we are as one and we shall share the burden and also the benefits. Think of a world where we have finally secured the entirety of Spain under Christian rule. How beautiful would that be. Think of the trade opportunities, a border finally at peace. That is something worth fighting for.\n\n\nSomething worth fighting for indeed. The sword opens the door so the gospel can enter in.\n\n\nI draw my sword and hold it up high towards the heaven.\n\n\nI will fight for that world. \nSoldiers of Christ arise! \nAre you ready to fight with me?"

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed crusade speech's potential, weighing advantages and challenges.\n\nThe user wants me to assess the probability of success for Juan's speech in Plaza de San Francisco, Seville. I need to evaluate this based on the context and the speech content itself, WITHOUT describing the outcome yet.\n\nLet me analyze the factors:\n\n**Factors strongly in favor:**\n\n1. **The setting and crowd**: 8,000-10,000 people in Seville, Juan's home city and power base. This is his territory.\n\n2. **The papal backing**: He has an actual crusade bull, authenticated relics (True Cross fragment and Santiago's bone). In medieval Europe, this is incredibly powerful legitimacy.\n\n3. **Visual spectacle**: The white banner with gold and silver reliquaries, 62 crusaders in white tabards with red crosses standing at attention. This is striking and memorable.\n\n4. **Previous successes**: He's done this twice before - Florence (critical success with 10,000 people) and Barcelona (great success with donations and recruits). He has experience now.\n\n5. **The practical appeal**: He's offering tangible benefits - trade, peace on the border, an end to frontier conflicts. Not just spiritual rewards but worldly ones.\n\n6. **Multiple ways to participate**: He's giving everyone a role - shelter, bread, money, or joining. This is inclusive.\n\n7. **Personal commitment**: \"I will succeed or I will die trying\" - that's powerful from an 18-year-old king.\n\n8. **The sword moment**: Drawing his father's sword with \"Non Nobis Domine\" and the \"Soldiers of Christ arise!\" call is dramatic and memorable.\n\n**Factors working against him:**\n\n1. **Recent political setback**: The noble assembly two days ago didn't go as well as hoped. Only gained 3-4 nobles shifting to support. That news has spread.\n\n2. **The Infantes situation**: People know there's internal conflict. Some might wonder if he should resolve that before starting crusade.\n\n3. **Granada's strength**: Anyone on the frontier knows Granada is strong and well-defended. \n\nAchieving success will be challenging. The economic and rhetorical obstacles present significant hurdles. Merchants may hesitate due to potential trade disruptions, while the speech's informal tone and somewhat vague mystical references could undermine its gravitas. The internal political tensions and uncertainty about the crusade's feasibility add further complexity to Juan's ambitious endeavor.\n\nComparing this speech to the legendary Florence address reveals nuanced challenges. The narrative arc shows promise, with compelling personal and spiritual appeals, yet it lacks the poetic resonance of previous oratory. Visual moments and a clear call to action provide strength, but the practical benefits section feels disconnected. Juan's experience and home city advantage offer potential, but he must elevate the rhetoric to match the momentous occasion.\n\nPolitical realities complicate the potential success. The recent noble assembly's disappointment and kingdom's divisions create underlying tension. Despite overwhelming advantages like papal backing and impressive relics, the speech's imperfections introduce uncertainty. Religious and practical appeals might resonate with common people and merchants, offering multiple participation pathways.\n\nThe outcome hangs in delicate balance - substantial recruitment and donations are possible, though perhaps not matching the Florence speech's legendary impact. Success depends on navigating these complex dynamics with strategic communication.\n\n\nProbability Assessment: The Plaza de San Francisco Speech\n\n\nOctober 2, 1430 - Late Morning\n\n\n\nFactors in Your Favor\n\n\nThe Setting:\n\n\n8,000-10,000 people in your home city\n\nMaximum visual impact - banner, relics, 62 crusaders in formation\n\nYou've done this successfully twice before (Florence, Barcelona)\n\n\nThe Legitimacy:\n\n\nPapal crusade bull with authentication\n\nActual True Cross fragment and Santiago's bone (undeniable relics)\n\nPope Martin V's personal blessing and tears\n\n\nThe Speech Strengths:\n\n\nPersonal narrative arc (journey → Rome → purpose → action)\n\nMultiple ways to participate (inclusive - shelter, bread, money, service)\n\nBoth spiritual AND practical appeals (peace, trade, security)\n\nPowerful visual moments (banner unfurling, sword raised)\n\nStrong closing call to action\n\n\"I will succeed or I will die trying\" - compelling from 18-year-old king\n\n\nThe Audience:\n\n\nCommon people respond powerfully to religious appeals\n\nMerchants see practical trade benefits\n\nSoldiers see opportunity for service and glory\n\nThis is Andalusia - they live on Granada frontier, feel the conflict daily\n\n\nFactors Working Against You\n\n\nRecent Context:\n\n\nNoble assembly two days ago was disappointing (minimal gains)\n\nKingdom remains divided despite your best efforts\n\nThat news has spread through Seville\n\n\nThe Speech Weaknesses:\n\n\nOpening is somewhat casual for gravity of moment\n\n\"Pull/feeling\" explanation might sound vague to skeptics\n\nSome phrasing feels rushed or awkward\n\nNot quite as poetically powerful as your Florence speech\n\nPractical benefits section feels slightly disconnected from spiritual message\n\n\nReality Factors:\n\n\nGranada is known to be strong and well-defended\n\nCrusades are expensive - merchants worry about costs\n\nInternal conflict with Infantes isn't resolved\n\nSome might wonder: shouldn't you fix Castile before attacking Granada?\n\n\n\nMy Assessment: LIKELY TO SUCCEED\n\n\nThe overwhelming advantages (papal backing, actual relics, home territory, visual spectacle, experience, inclusive message) outweigh the speech's imperfections and recent political disappointments.\n\n\nYou won't match Florence's legendary response, but you'll generate substantial support - recruits, donations, and popular enthusiasm that puts pressure on hesitant nobles.\n\n\n\nRoll and tell me the result: Great Success, Success, Failure, or Catastrophic Failure."

This is different - louder in some ways, messier, more varied. But still powerful.\n\n\n\"DIOS LO VULT! DIOS LO VULT!\" The cry rises from hundreds of throats. \"GOD WILLS IT!\"\n\n\nPeople surge forward toward the platform. The crusaders lock shields to maintain the barrier, but they're grinning. Hands reach up trying to touch the platform, to get closer to the banner.\n\n\nWomen weep. Men shout. Children stare wide-eyed. Several people drop to their knees in prayer right there in the packed plaza.\n\n\nWhen the noise finally subsides enough for people to move, three things happen simultaneously:\n\n\nThe Recruitment Rush:\n\n\nYoung men - and a few not-so-young - push toward the table Rodrigo set up. Within an hour, over two hundred have given their names. The line stretches around the plaza. Rodrigo and his guards struggle to maintain order as applicants argue about who was first.\n\n\nThe Donation Surge:\n\n\nDiego's donation table is swarmed. Merchants drop heavy purses. Common people leave what coins they can spare. One wealthy widow removes her gold necklace and places it on the table: \"For the crusade. My husband would have wanted this.\"\n\n\nBy afternoon's end, Diego counts over 15,000 florins in gold, silver, and pledges. Not Barcelona's 82,000, but substantial.\n\n\nThe Popular Energy:\n\n\nAs you descend from the platform, people press close despite the guards. They want to touch your cloak, your hand, anything. An old woman kisses your ring. A man shouts: \"My son will join! He'll serve you, Majesty!\" Others echo: \"My brother!\" \"My nephew!\" \"I'll go myself!\"\n\n\nThe enthusiasm is real, visceral, chaotic.\n\n\n\nThe Mixed Results\n\n\nOver the next three days as the cathedral campaign continues, the full picture emerges:\n\n\nRecruitment (By October 5th):\n\n\n287 applications received\n\nAfter Rodrigo's physical screening: 156 suitable\n\nAfter Fray Hernando's spiritual screening: 89 accepted\n\nNet gain: 89 new crusaders (total force now 151)\n\n\nNot the 100+ you might have hoped for, but solid growth.\n\n\nDonations:\n\n\n15,000 florins from plaza speech\n\nAdditional 8,000 florins during three-day cathedral display\n\nTotal: 23,000 florins\n\n\nGood, but not transformative compared to your existing treasury.\n\n\nPopular Support:\n\n\nThe common people are energized. The streets buzz with talk of the crusade. Your white-clad crusaders are stopped constantly by well-wishers. Taverns echo with crusading songs.\n\n\nBut...\n\n\nThe Noble Reaction:\n\n\nThat evening, Álvaro brings sobering news. \"Your Majesty, the nobles... they're watching. Some are impressed by the popular response. Others are saying: 'The King excites the mob but cannot unite the nobility. Common enthusiasm doesn't win wars.'\"\n\n\nSeveral neutral nobles sent polite notes congratulating you on the speech but made no concrete pledges of support.\n\n\nThe Reality:\n\n\nYou've gained significant popular backing and swelled your crusader ranks. The common people love you. But the political situation - the nobles, the Infantes, the divided kingdom - remains largely unchanged.\n\n\nYou're building from the bottom up, which gives you strength. But the top remains fractured.\n\n\n\nIt's now October 5th. The three-day cathedral display has concluded. You have 151 crusaders, an additional 23,000 florins, and substantial popular enthusiasm.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán should return from Castile any day with intelligence about the Infantes' current position and reaction to your demands.\n\n\nThe November 8th Council is five weeks away."

Accept the safe conduct - attend the Council\n- Pros: Shows they're not afraid, gives them public platform, Alfonso requested this, refusing makes them look guilty\n- Cons: They'll face hostile nobility in Juan's city, might be condemned publicly\n- Likelihood: HIGH - this is what Alfonso asked for, and refusing looks bad\n\n2.

They're isolated, weakened, but not destroyed. Alfonso is watching. They know about your papal backing and popular support.\"\n\n\nHe begins writing possible responses:\n\n\n\nOption 1: Simple Acceptance (40% probability)\n\n\nTheir Response:\n\n\n\"His Majesty's gracious offer of safe conduct is accepted. The Infantes Juan and Enrique will attend the Royal Council in Seville on November 8th to address misunderstandings and clarify events during His Majesty's absence. We look forward to honest dialogue before the assembled nobility of Castile.\"\n\n\nWhy they might do this:\n\n\nIt's what Alfonso asked for in his letter\n\nRefusing makes them look guilty and cowardly\n\nGives them public platform to present their version\n\nShows confidence\n\nSafe conduct is legitimate - violating it would destroy Juan's honor\n\n\nWhat it means:\nThey'll actually show up, speak their piece, try to win nobles' sympathy, then leave under safe conduct to fight another day politically.\n\n\n\nOption 2: Acceptance With Conditions (30% probability)\n\n\nTheir Response:\n\n\n\"We accept His Majesty's offer of safe conduct, but request certain assurances:\n\n\n- The Council proceedings be witnessed by neutral observers, including representatives from Aragon\n- Both parties be given equal time to present evidence\n- No formal vote or judgment be taken at the Council itself - only testimony heard\n- Our retinues be allowed to accompany us (20 men each) for security\n- The proceedings be recorded by scribes we provide as well as the King's\n\n\nWith these reasonable conditions met, we will gladly attend and present our case.\"\n\n\nWhy they might do this:\n\n\nShows they're not capitulating completely\n\nBuilds in protections and witnesses\n\nMakes them look reasonable (\"we just want fairness\")\n\nGives them excuse to refuse if Juan rejects conditions\n\n\nWhat it means:\nThey're hedging, trying to control the format, but still basically willing to attend. You'd need to negotiate which conditions are acceptable.\n\n\n\nOption 3: Conditional Acceptance - Venue Change (15% probability)\n\n\nTheir Response:\n\n\n\"We appreciate His Majesty's gesture toward peaceful resolution. However, we note that Seville is His Majesty's stronghold, where popular sentiment has been inflamed against us through recent speeches.\n\n\nWe propose instead: The Council convene in Toledo, a more neutral location, or that this matter be heard separately before a smaller tribunal of mutually agreed nobles before the full Council.\n\n\nWe remain willing to answer all charges, but seek genuinely neutral venue where truth can emerge without intimidation.\"\n\n\nWhy they might do this:\n\n\nAvoids coming to your territory where you're strongest\n\nToledo is more neutral\n\nSounds reasonable (\"just want fairness\")\n\nGives them excuse if you refuse\n\n\nWhat it means:\nThey're scared of coming to Seville. This would delay everything and require renegotiation.\n\n\n\nOption 4: Defiant Refusal (10% probability)\n\n\nTheir Response:\n\n\n\"His Majesty's offer comes too late and from position of bad faith. His Majesty ordered our arrest without proper hearing, sent his favorite to seize us by force, and only now offers 'safe conduct' after failing to take us by arms.\n\n\nWe will not subject ourselves to show trial in His Majesty's city, before His Majesty's supporters, under pretense of 'safe conduct.'\n\n\nWe remain in our lawful holdings and will answer to properly constituted tribunal, not partisan assembly. His Majesty knows where to find us if he wishes genuine dialogue.\"\n\n\nWhy they might do this:\n\n\nIf they're desperate and cornered\n\nIf they think they can win militarily with Alfonso's help\n\nIf they believe attending = certain condemnation\n\n\nWhat it means:\nOpen defiance.

Let me think about what Juan offered and Alfonso's position:\n\nWhat Juan offered:\n- Safe conduct for the Infantes to attend the Royal Council\n- Fair treatment befitting their royal status\n- Mentioned his papal crusade bull and divine commission\n- Referenced the positive Barcelona experience and María\n- Offered support for Alfonso's Italian/Naples ambitions (military forces, naval support, financial assistance, diplomatic backing)\n- Proposed personal meeting when convenient\n- Framed it as partnership between kingdoms focused on respective strategic goals\n\nAlfonso's situation:\n- In Naples pursuing his claims\n- His brothers are the Infantes causing trouble in Castile\n- Family loyalty vs. strategic interests\n- Needs resources for Italian campaigns\n- Doesn't want to look like he abandoned his brothers\n- But also doesn't want perpetual conflict in Iberia draining resources\n- The papal backing Juan has is significant - Alfonso can't easily oppose the Pope\n- María (Juan's sister, Alfonso's wife) is involved and likely supports reconciliation\n\nLet me draft possible responses with different probabilities:\n\n1. Positive acceptance of partnership - Alfonso agrees to withdraw protection in exchange for Italian support\n2. Cautious acceptance - interested but wants more details/guarantees\n3. Conditional support - he'll accept partnership but with specific conditions protecting his brothers\n4. Non-committal response - acknowledges letter, doesn't commit either way\n5. Rejection - refuses to abandon brothers or make deal\n\nGiven Alfonso's strategic situation (focused on Italy, resources stretched, papal backing matters, María's influence), I think he's more likely to be positive or cautious than outright rejecting. But he also can't be seen as abandoning family easily.\n\n\nKing Alfonso's Response - Possible Options\n\n\nMid-October, 1430\n\n\n\nÁlvaro spreads out a new parchment. \"Alfonso is more complex than his brothers. He's a king with his own strategic priorities. Let me think through his position.\"\n\n\nHe writes:\n\n\n\nOption 1: Strategic Partnership Accepted (25% probability)\n\n\nHis Response:\n\n\n\"Cousin, your letter arrives at a moment when our thoughts have been much occupied with the balance of interests between our kingdoms.\n\n\nWe are pleased that you have granted our brothers safe conduct and fair hearing. This demonstrates the wisdom we expected from you.\n\n\nRegarding your proposal of partnership for our Italian endeavors: We are intrigued. The prospect of Castilian support - military, naval, financial, and diplomatic - would significantly advance our rightful claims in Naples and strengthen Christian presence in the Mediterranean.\n\n\nWe propose this: Let the November Council proceed. Let our brothers answer charges fairly before witnesses. Whatever judgment emerges, we will respect Castilian internal sovereignty. In return, we shall begin formal negotiations for the Mediterranean partnership you describe.\n\n\nWe believe our kingdoms prosper more through cooperation than conflict. The matter of our brothers need not define our relationship.\n\n\nWe look forward to meeting you personally when our respective duties permit.\n\n\nAlfonso R.\"\n\n\nWhy he might do this:\n\n\nItalian ambitions genuinely more important than brothers' Castilian schemes\n\nPapal backing Juan has is too significant to oppose\n\nPartnership offers real strategic value\n\nCan frame it as \"respecting Castilian sovereignty\" not \"abandoning brothers\"\n\nMaría (his wife, Juan's sister) likely urging reconciliation\n\n\nWhat it means:\nHe's effectively withdrawing protection in exchange for partnership. You've won the diplomatic gambit.\n\n\n\nOption 2: Interested But Cautious (35% probability)\n\n\nHis Response:\n\n\n\"Cousin, we acknowledge receipt of your thoughtful letter and appreciate the spirit of partnership it proposes.\n\n\nWe are glad you have granted our brothers safe conduct to present their case. This is proper and honorable.\n\n\nRegarding broader partnership: Your proposal merits serious consideration. Castilian support for our Mediterranean endeavors would indeed benefit both kingdoms. However, such significant alliance requires careful negotiation of specific terms, commitments, and timelines.\n\n\nWe propose: Let the November Council resolve immediate tensions. Then send ambassadors to Naples to discuss partnership details - what forces, what costs, what mutual obligations. Such matters cannot be settled through letters alone.\n\n\nWe remain open to strengthening bonds between Aragon and Castile, but must ensure any agreement serves both kingdoms' interests fairly.\n\n\nAlfonso R.\"\n\n\nWhy he might do this:\n\n\nLikes the idea but wants details before committing\n\nDoesn't want to abandon brothers precipitously\n\nCautious by nature, wants to negotiate properly\n\nBuying time to see how Council goes\n\n\nWhat it means:\nHe's not saying yes or no. Keeps options open. You'll need follow-up diplomacy but haven't been rejected.\n\n\n\nOption 3: Conditional Support (20% probability)\n\n\nHis Response:\n\n\n\"Cousin, we appreciate your letter and your grant of safe conduct to our brothers.\n\n\nWe are willing to discuss partnership for Mediterranean endeavors. However, we must be frank: our brothers' welfare remains our concern.\n\n\nWe propose these conditions:\n- Our brothers receive genuinely fair hearing, not show trial\n- Whatever judgment emerges, their lives and core estates be protected\n- They not be imprisoned or executed\n- If found to have overstepped, let them retire to private life with dignity\n\n\nWith these assurances, we would be prepared to negotiate the Castilian-Aragonese partnership you describe. Without them, we cannot in good conscience abandon our family to uncertain fate.\n\n\nThis is not threat, merely clarity about what honor requires of us.\n\n\nAlfonso R.\"\n\n\nWhy he might do this:\n\n\nFamily loyalty matters but not enough to reject partnership entirely\n\nWants to protect brothers while still getting what he wants\n\nPractical compromise\n\n\nWhat it means:\nHe'll make the deal but you have to guarantee the Infantes don't die or lose everything. Constrains your options but still workable.\n\n\n\nOption 4: Non-Committal Response (15% probability)\n\n\nHis Response:\n\n\n\"Cousin, your letter received and read with interest.\n\n\nWe are pleased you granted our brothers safe conduct. We trust the November Council will be conducted with fairness appropriate to their station.\n\n\nRegarding broader partnership: These are weighty matters requiring careful thought. We are currently much occupied with affairs in Naples and cannot give such proposals the attention they deserve at this moment.\n\n\nWe remain committed to good relations between our kingdoms and hope the November Council brings clarity to current tensions.\n\n\nAlfonso R.\"\n\n\nWhy he might do this:\n\n\nGenuinely too busy/distracted with Naples\n\nDoesn't want to commit without seeing how Council goes\n\nRisk-averse, waiting to see which way wind blows\n\n\nWhat it means:\nHe's punting. Not helping, not opposing. Everything remains uncertain.\n\n\n\nOption 5: Rejection - Family First (5% probability)\n\n\nHis Response:\n\n\n\"Cousin, while we appreciate the grant of safe conduct to our brothers, we must speak plainly.\n\n\nOur brothers are princes of the House of Aragon, our own blood. Whatever disagreements occurred during your absence, we cannot support any arrangement that sees them condemned or diminished.\n\n\nYour offer of partnership in Italian affairs is noted, but we will not trade our family's honor for strategic advantage. Some things matter more than Naples.\n\n\nWe trust the November Council will reveal that our brothers acted to preserve Castilian stability during your absence, not to undermine your crown.\n\n\nWe remain open to good relations between our kingdoms, but not at the price of abandoning family.\n\n\nAlfonso R.\"\n\n\nWhy he might do this:\n\n\nStrong sense of family honor\n\nBelieves brothers will be vindicated at Council\n\nDoesn't really need Castilian help in Italy\n\nUnderestimates Juan\n\n\nWhat it means:\nHe's chosen brothers over partnership. Makes everything harder.\n\n\n\nÁlvaro looks up. \"Your Majesty, Alfonso is pragmatic and ambitious. I think Options 1, 2, or 3 are most likely - he wants something from you, and you're offering it.

Not advance the timeline beyond mid-October\n6. Leave room for user interaction\n\nThe letter should be diplomatic, cautiously positive, but non-committal on specifics. Alfonso is interested but wants to see how the Council plays out before fully committing.\n\n\nAlfonso's Response Arrives\n\n\nSeville, October 22, 1430\n\n\n\nThe galley from Naples docks in the late afternoon. Fernán Álvarez de Toledo, your messenger, disembarks looking exhausted but satisfied. He carries a sealed letter bearing Alfonso V's royal seal.\n\n\nHe's brought directly to your chambers where Álvaro and Fray Hernando are present.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Fernán bows deeply. \"King Alfonso received you with courtesy and read your letter carefully. He deliberated for three days before responding. This is his reply.\"\n\n\nYou break the seal and read:\n\n\n\nTo Our Esteemed Cousin Juan, King of Castile and León,\n\n\nGreetings from Naples, where We prosecute Our rightful claims with God's blessing.\n\n\nYour letter reached Us and has been read with the attention it deserves. We acknowledge the thoughtful spirit in which it was composed and appreciate your grant of safe conduct to Our brothers, the Infantes Juan and Enrique.\n\n\nThis gesture of allowing them fair hearing before the assembled nobility of Castile demonstrates the wisdom and honor We expected from Our cousin. That you frame this as opportunity for direct dialogue rather than summary judgment speaks well of your intentions.\n\n\nRegarding your proposal of partnership between Castile and Aragon in support of Our Mediterranean endeavors: We find the concept intriguing and worthy of serious consideration. The matters you raise - military cooperation, naval support, financial assistance, diplomatic coordination - these are significant undertakings that could indeed benefit both our kingdoms.\n\n\nHowever, such an alliance represents commitment of considerable resources and adjustment of strategic priorities for both realms. These are not matters to be settled hastily through correspondence alone, however eloquent.\n\n\nTherefore, We propose the following course:\n\n\nFirst, let the Royal Council of November 8th proceed and resolve the immediate tensions regarding Our brothers. We trust this will be conducted with the fairness and dignity appropriate to princes of royal blood.\n\n\nSecond, following the Council, We recommend formal negotiations between our kingdoms regarding the partnership you describe. Send ambassadors to Naples - men empowered to discuss specific terms: what forces Castile would commit, what timeline, what costs each kingdom bears, what mutual obligations result.\n\n\nThese negotiations should address practical questions: How many troops and for how long? Which naval assets and under whose command? What financial contributions and from what sources? What happens if circumstances change or if one kingdom faces threats requiring resources to be diverted?\n\n\nWe do not raise these questions to diminish your proposal, but rather because We take it seriously. Alliances built on vague promises collapse under pressure. Alliances built on clear terms endure.\n\n\nThird, We would indeed welcome meeting you personally when our respective duties permit. Kings understand each other better face-to-face than through any number of letters. Perhaps in spring, if circumstances allow, We might arrange such a meeting - whether in Italy, Aragon, or neutral ground.\n\n\nWe believe, as you do, that Castile and Aragon prosper more through cooperation than conflict. Your recent visit to Barcelona and the support you received there demonstrates the natural affinity between our peoples. Your sister, Our beloved wife María, speaks warmly of her time with you and hopes for continued harmony between our houses.\n\n\nWe note with interest your commission from His Holiness Pope Martin V for crusade against Granada. This is a worthy undertaking that, if successful, would strengthen Christian presence throughout Iberia. The completion of the Reconquista has long been a goal of our kingdoms.\n\n\nLet the November Council bring clarity. Let us then discuss partnership with precision and mutual benefit. We are open to strengthening bonds between our crowns, but must ensure any agreement serves both kingdoms fairly and practically.\n\n\nWe wish you wisdom in the coming Council and success in your sacred charge.\n\n\nGiven at Naples, this eighteenth day of October, 1430,\n\n\nAlfonso, by the Grace of God King of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia and Corsica, Count of Barcelona, Duke of Athens and Neopatria\n\n\n\nThe Reactions\n\n\nÁlvaro reads over your shoulder, his expression shifting from hope to calculation to mild disappointment.\n\n\n\"It's... not a rejection. But it's not the full commitment we hoped for either.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando observes: \"He's being careful. Very careful. He wants to see how the Council goes before deciding whether to abandon his brothers.\"\n\n\nFernán Álvarez speaks: \"Your Majesty, if I may - King Alfonso was genuinely interested when we discussed this. His advisors were intrigued. But they kept asking detailed questions: How many troops exactly? For how long? What if Granada attacks while Castilian forces are in Italy? They're serious about considering it, but they want specifics.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro sits down heavily. \"So here's what we have: Alfonso won't actively oppose us at the Council. He's told his brothers to attend and face judgment. But he hasn't withdrawn protection either. He's waiting to see what happens.\"\n\n\nHe taps the letter. \"If the Council goes well - if the nobles condemn the Infantes and we handle it properly - Alfonso will likely make the deal. But if the Council is messy, if we look weak, if things get complicated... he might back away entirely.\"\n\n\n\"Everything still comes down to November 8th.\"\n\n\n\nStrategic Assessment\n\n\nÁlvaro spreads his hands. \"Your Majesty, this isn't the clear victory we wanted, but it's not disaster either. Let me break down where we stand:\"\n\n\nWhat We Gained:\n\n\nAlfonso acknowledges safe conduct was proper\n\nHe's explicitly interested in partnership (not rejecting it)\n\nHe's not threatening intervention\n\nHe wants post-Council negotiations (implies he expects to deal with you afterward)\n\nMaría is quietly supporting you\n\n\nWhat We Didn't Gain:\n\n\nNo commitment to withdraw protection from Infantes\n\nNo guarantee he won't intervene if things go badly\n\nStill must prove ourselves at the Council first\n\n\nWhat It Means:\n\n\nThe Council becomes even more critical\n\nMust demonstrate strength and competence there\n\nIf we handle it well, Alfonso partnership becomes likely\n\nIf we fumble it, he stays neutral or worse\n\n\nFray Hernando adds quietly: \"He mentions your 'sacred charge' from the Pope. He's acknowledging the crusade's legitimacy. That's not nothing.\"\n\n\n\nIt's now October 22nd. The Council is seventeen days away.\n\n\nStill no word from Portugal about the marriage proposal.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán has still not returned from his mission to Castile with intelligence about current conditions there."

Minutes later, three riders enter through the main gate - Fernán, Martín, and Felipe, all looking road-worn and exhausted but healthy.\n\n\nFernán dismounts stiffly, clearly saddle-sore from hard riding. He bows. \"Your Majesty, my apologies for the delay. There was much to observe.\"\n\n\nYou bring him and Álvaro to your private chambers. Fernán has saddlebags full of documents and notes.\n\n\n\nThe Failed Arrest - Eyewitness Account\n\n\nFernán reports what he witnessed at Arévalo:\n\n\n\"I delivered your orders to Don Álvaro on September 2nd. He acted immediately - no hesitation. September 5th, he made the public demand: summoned the Infantes to surrender themselves for trial at your command.\"\n\n\n\"They refused publicly. Infante Juan read a prepared statement - claimed the arrest orders were 'unlawful persecution by the King's favorite, issued without proper counsel.' He demanded to answer charges before you personally, not submit to Don Álvaro.\"\n\n\n\"Don Álvaro moved to enforce the arrest anyway. Took 400 men to Arévalo where Infante Juan had fortified. Three-day standoff. Infante Enrique was at a different location with his own forces.\"\n\n\nFernán's face darkens. \"Your Majesty, they were ready. They had supplies, defensive positions prepared, troops positioned. They knew it was coming. The fortifications at Arévalo looked weeks in the making, not improvised.\"\n\n\n\"Don Álvaro withdrew rather than storm the fortress. He said: 'I will not start civil war over this. Better to let the November Council handle it.'\"\n\n\n\nThe Infantes' Current Position\n\n\nFernán spreads a map and marks positions:\n\n\nMilitary Strength:\n\"Infante Juan commands approximately 2,500 troops - his household guard plus levies from allied nobles. Currently at Arévalo fortress and his estates in Old Castile.\"\n\n\n\"Infante Enrique commands approximately 2,000 troops. Currently at Medina del Campo with forward positions near Valladolid.\"\n\n\n\"Combined: roughly 4,500 troops under their direct command.\"\n\n\n\"The Master of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán) pledged another 1,500 from the Order if needed. That's 6,000 potential.\"\n\n\nNoble Support:\n\"Eight major houses explicitly supporting them: Estúñiga, Manrique de Lara, Pimentel, Acuña, and four others. These are the ones who joined the rebellion.\"\n\n\n\"Maybe 12-15 more houses that haven't declared but lean toward them - mostly northern nobility with Navarrese connections or those who resent Don Álvaro personally.\"\n\n\nTerritory Controlled:\n\n\nArévalo fortress (strong position)\n\nTwo minor northern castles\n\nTheir personal estates\n\nLoose influence in parts of Old Castile and León\n\nNO major cities (all stayed loyal to you)\n\n\n\nRoyal Position Under Álvaro\n\n\n\"Don Álvaro holds firm, Your Majesty. The royal administration functions. All major cities remain loyal - Valladolid, Burgos, Toledo, Salamanca, Segovia.\"\n\n\nFernán pulls out several letters. \"Don Álvaro sent these. He wanted you to have complete picture.\"\n\n\nThe letters report:\n\n\nTreasury: Stable at ~30 million maravedís annual revenue. The failed arrest didn't disrupt collections significantly.\n\n\nMilitary: Royal household troops number ~3,000. Levies from loyal nobles could raise another 6,000-8,000 if needed.\n\n\nPolitical Climate: Tense. Many nobles watching and waiting. The Infantes' refusal to submit hurt their credibility with some neutrals (\"if they're innocent, why not face justice?\") but others see the standoff as proof the kingdom is ungovernable.\n\n\nYour Cabinet: All five members of your secret intelligence network still functioning well. They've been gathering information throughout your absence.\n\n\n\nThe Infantes' Propaganda Campaign\n\n\nFernán's face shows distaste. \"Your Majesty, they've been spreading stories. Letters to nobles across Castile, sermons by friendly priests, rumors through markets.\"\n\n\nTheir narrative:\n\n\n\"The young King is dominated by low-born Álvaro de Luna\"\n\n\"The pilgrimage to Rome was mystical wandering, not proper kingship\"\n\n\"Álvaro ordered the arrest without the King's knowledge or proper authority\"\n\n\"We acted to preserve the realm during the King's absence, not to rebel\"\n\n\"We're being persecuted for opposing Álvaro's monopoly on power\"\n\n\"The crusade against Granada is distraction from fixing internal problems\"\n\n\n\"Some nobles believe it, Your Majesty. Or at least find it convenient to believe. Others see through it but use it as excuse to stay neutral.\"\n\n\n\nPopular Sentiment\n\n\n\"The common people support you strongly, especially in the cities. They see:\n\n\nThe papal blessing\n\nThe crusade\n\nA young king trying to do right\n\nÁlvaro defending the crown successfully\n\n\n\"The Infantes have support mainly among nobility and in rural areas where local lords control opinion. But the cities are yours.\"\n\n\n\nStrategic Assessment\n\n\nFernán concludes: \"Your Majesty, militarily the Infantes could cause serious problems if it comes to war. Six thousand troops in strong positions is not nothing. But politically, they're isolated. They don't control any cities, the Church hierarchy leans toward you, and even many neutral nobles are uncomfortable with open defiance.\"\n\n\n\"Don Álvaro's assessment: The November Council is everything. If you can get a strong condemnation from the assembled nobility, the Infantes' position collapses. If the Council is divided or weak, they'll claim vindication and this drags on.\"\n\n\nHe pulls out Álvaro's final letter to you personally:\n\n\n\nYour Majesty,\n\n\nThe realm holds, but barely. The Infantes' refusal to submit has emboldened some nobles to question royal authority. Every week this continues, more neutrals wonder if backing you is wise.\n\n\nThe Council in November must be decisive. Clear evidence, strong testimony, overwhelming moral position. We cannot have another lukewarm result like your first assembly.\n\n\nI have faith in you. But this is the moment. Win the Council decisively, or we face years of conflict.\n\n\nYour loyal servant,\nÁlvaro\n\n\n\nFernán looks exhausted. \"That's the full report, Your Majesty. I stayed two extra weeks gathering details. Is there anything specific you want to know?\""

Álvaro de Luna has been with Juan in Seville this entire time - he was at the noble assembly, he's been helping plan the cathedral campaign, he drafted the letters to Alfonso and Portugal, etc.\n\nÁlvaro was NOT in Valladolid managing the arrest attempt. Captain Fernán went to deliver orders to someone else in the royal administration - probably to officials in Valladolid who would enforce the arrest orders.\n\nLet me correct this. The person managing things in Castile while Juan was away would have been Juan's administrators and officials, but not Álvaro specifically since Álvaro traveled with Juan or met him in Seville.\n\nActually, wait - let me check the earlier story. Looking back at Chapter 1:\n\n\"Álvaro de Luna's Defense:\n- Successfully held Valladolid and royal administration\"\n\nSo during Juan's pilgrimage (Chapters 2-3), Álvaro was in Valladolid holding the kingdom. But when did Álvaro join Juan in Seville?\n\nLooking at Chapter 6 summary: \"Juan arrived to find... Álvaro de Luna held kingdom successfully\"\n\nAnd then in our recent scenes, Álvaro has definitely been present in Seville with Juan since his return (September 28 onward).\n\nSo the timeline is:\n- May-August: Juan on pilgrimage, Álvaro holds Valladolid\n- September: Juan returns to Seville\n- September 19: Juan sends Captain Fernán with arrest orders - but to WHO?\n\nIf Álvaro is already with Juan in Seville by September 19, then the orders must have gone to other officials in Valladolid/Castile proper.\n\nLet me redraft this correctly.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán Returns - CORRECTED\n\n\nSeville, October 23, 1430 - Morning\n\n\n\nYou're right, Your Majesty.

Enthusiastic acceptance - they see this as great opportunity\n2. Cautious acceptance with conditions - want assurances\n3. Delayed response - need more time/information\n4. Counter-proposal (different princess or terms)\n5. Polite rejection or postponement\n\nLet me think about probabilities:\n- Portugal generally wants good relations with Castile\n- Juan now has papal backing (very prestigious)\n- The Infantes problem is concerning but not insurmountable\n- Wealthy dowry from Portugal helps both sides\n- Marriage alliances are normal diplomacy\n\nI'd say acceptance is most likely, but with Portuguese caution, probably with some conditions or careful terms.\n\n\nPortuguese Response - Possible Options\n\n\nLate October, 1430\n\n\n\nÁlvaro pulls out fresh parchment. \"Portugal has been watching Castile carefully, Your Majesty. King João is old and cautious. His son Duarte runs most affairs now and is even more careful than his father.\"\n\n\nHe begins drafting possibilities:\n\n\n\nOption 1: Enthusiastic Acceptance (30% probability)\n\n\nTheir Response:\n\n\n\"To His Majesty Juan II, King of Castile and León,\n\n\nYour proposal of marriage alliance between our houses has been received with great interest and favor.\n\n\nPrincess Isabel of Portugal would be honored to accept your hand in marriage. She is fifteen years of age, educated in letters and piety, and has been raised to understand the duties of queenship.\n\n\nWe propose the following terms:\n\n\nDowry: 60,000 gold dobras (approximately 180,000 florins), paid in three installments\n\n\nThe Princess will be accompanied by suitable Portuguese household and ladies-in-waiting\n\n\nMarriage to take place in Seville or Toledo at your convenience, we suggest January or February 1431\n\n\nStandard defensive alliance: mutual aid if either kingdom attacked\n\n\nThe Princess departs Lisbon in late November, arrives Castile in December, allowing time for proper wedding preparations\n\n\nWe congratulate you on your papal commission and crusade. Portugal stands ready to support this holy work through our new family bonds.\n\n\nJoão, King of Portugal\"\n\n\nWhy they might do this:\n\n\nJuan has papal backing (very prestigious)\n\nCrusade gives him legitimacy and purpose\n\nPortugal wants stable, friendly Castile on their border\n\nMarriage neutralizes potential Castilian threat\n\nThey're wealthy enough to afford generous dowry\n\nSee opportunity before other powers claim Juan\n\n\nWhat it means:\nComplete diplomatic success. Princess arrives by December, wedding in January, succession secured before crusade begins.\n\n\n\nOption 2: Cautious Acceptance with Conditions (40% probability)\n\n\nTheir Response:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\n\n\nYour proposal has been considered carefully by King João and Prince Duarte. We view marriage alliance between Portugal and Castile favorably and believe Princess Isabel would be suitable match.\n\n\nHowever, we must address certain practical concerns:\n\n\nFirst, we note the current internal tensions in Castile regarding the Infantes de Aragón. We would need assurance that Princess Isabel's safety and position would not be compromised by ongoing conflicts.\n\n\nSecond, regarding the dowry and terms: We propose 50,000 gold dobras paid over two years, with marriage contract specifying the Princess's household, rights, and properties.\n\n\nThird, we suggest the wedding take place after your November Council resolves current tensions, allowing for more stable circumstances. Perhaps February or March 1431?\n\n\nWe ask that you send senior ambassador to Lisbon to negotiate final details - matters of this importance deserve careful discussion beyond letters.\n\n\nWe are favorably disposed toward this alliance, but wish to ensure all is properly arranged.\n\n\nJoão R.\"\n\n\nWhy they might do this:\n\n\nInterested but cautious about Castilian instability\n\nWant to protect their princess\n\nStandard Portuguese carefulness\n\nSee value but want guarantees\n\nDon't want to appear too eager\n\n\nWhat it means:\nThey'll make the deal but want details negotiated. Delays wedding slightly. More back-and-forth needed but outcome positive.\n\n\n\nOption 3: Interested But Waiting (20% probability)\n\n\nTheir Response:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\n\n\nYour proposal regarding Princess Isabel has been received and read with interest.\n\n\nMarriage alliance between our kingdoms has much to recommend it. However, given current circumstances in Castile - the pending Council, the tensions with the Infantes, the beginning of your crusade - we believe prudence suggests waiting until these matters are resolved.\n\n\nWe propose: Let your November Council conclude. Let the immediate internal questions be settled. Then, in early 1431, we can proceed with marriage negotiations with clearer understanding of circumstances.\n\n\nThis is not rejection, merely caution. Princess Isabel is young; a few months' delay serves everyone's interests by ensuring stable foundation for marriage.\n\n\nWe wish you success at the upcoming Council and in your holy crusade.\n\n\nJoão R.\"\n\n\nWhy they might do this:\n\n\nVery cautious by nature\n\nWant to see if Juan survives political challenges\n\nWorried about committing princess to unstable situation\n\nHedge until things are clearer\n\n\nWhat it means:\nNot rejection but significant delay. Have to renegotiate in early 1431. Wedding probably not until spring or summer. Succession concerns continue.\n\n\n\nOption 4: Counter-Proposal (7% probability)\n\n\nTheir Response:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\n\n\nWe have considered your marriage proposal carefully.\n\n\nWe note that Princess Isabel is quite young - only fifteen. We wonder if a betrothal arrangement might be more suitable, with marriage to follow in 1432 when she is seventeen and more prepared for queenship's duties.\n\n\nAlternatively, if Your Majesty seeks more immediate marriage, we could discuss Princess Leonor (though she is only six years old, so this would be long betrothal).\n\n\nOr we might consider other arrangements - perhaps diplomatic and trade alliance without marriage, or marriage between your future heirs rather than yourself.\n\n\nWe remain open to strengthening bonds between our kingdoms and welcome further discussion of how best to achieve this.\n\n\nJoão R.\"\n\n\nWhy they might do this:\n\n\nThink Isabel too young\n\nWant different terms\n\nUsing negotiation tactics\n\nGenuinely concerned about age\n\n\nWhat it means:\nComplicates everything. Have to renegotiate terms. Probably delays wedding significantly.\n\n\n\nOption 5: Polite Postponement (3% probability)\n\n\nTheir Response:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\n\n\nYour proposal honors our house and has been given the serious consideration it deserves.\n\n\nAt this time, given Princess Isabel's youth and the current circumstances in both our kingdoms, we believe it premature to finalize such arrangements.\n\n\nWe value good relations with Castile and wish you success in resolving internal matters and in your crusade. When circumstances are more settled, we would be pleased to discuss such matters again.\n\n\nWe remain your friends and neighbors.\n\n\nJoão R.\"\n\n\nWhy they might do this:\n\n\nToo worried about Castilian instability\n\nThink Juan might not survive politically\n\nHave other plans for Isabel\n\nPortuguese caution taken to extreme\n\n\nWhat it means:\nDiplomatic failure. No marriage alliance. Succession problem continues. Back to drawing board.\n\n\n\nÁlvaro looks up. \"Your Majesty, Portugal is cautious but practical. I think Options 1 or 2 are most likely - they'll say yes, but might want conditions or negotiations. Option 3 is possible if they're very worried about our internal situation. Options 4 and 5 would be disappointing but manageable.\"\n\n\n\"Roll 1d100:\n\n\n1-30: Enthusiastic Acceptance (Option 1)\n\n31-70: Cautious Acceptance with Conditions (Option 2)\n\n71-90: Interested But Waiting (Option 3)\n\n91-97: Counter-Proposal (Option 4)\n\n98-100: Polite Postponement (Option 5)\"\n\n\n\"What do you roll?\""

Better than I hoped.\"\n\n\nHe points to specific passages. \"Look at the terms. 60,000 dobras - that's approximately 180,000 florins. That's enormous. Combined with what you've raised from Barcelona, Florence, and Seville, your war chest becomes truly substantial.\"\n\n\n\"And eight galleys for a year? That's significant naval power. If Granada's corsairs try anything, you have Portuguese warships backing you.\"\n\n\nAdmiral Diego speaks: \"Your Majesty, King João and Prince Duarte were very receptive. They see the papal backing as decisive - it transforms you from 'young king with internal problems' to 'papal crusader with divine mandate.' They want to align with that.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando steps forward quietly. \"Your Majesty, Princess Isabel is reportedly devout. She's been educated by Franciscan sisters and is known for charitable works. The Portuguese court speaks well of her character.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro continues analyzing: \"The timeline works perfectly. She arrives mid-December. Wedding in January. You'll have a queen crowned before spring. If she's pregnant by summer, you have succession secured by end of 1431.\"\n\n\nHe grins. \"And announcing this betrothal at the November Council - alongside the papal crusade bull, the crusaders, everything else - completely changes the dynamic. The nobles' biggest concern was your lack of heir. Now that's solved.\"\n\n\n\nStrategic Impact\n\n\nÁlvaro spreads out documents, calculating rapidly.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, let me show you what this does to your position at the Council:\"\n\n\nBefore Portuguese Acceptance:\n\n\nStrong: Papal backing, popular support, crusader force\n\nWeak: No heir, Infantes still threatening, Alfonso uncertain, succession vulnerable\n\n\nAfter Portuguese Acceptance:\n\n\nStrong: Everything above PLUS secured succession, 180,000 florins, Portuguese naval support, diplomatic victory\n\nWeak: Only the Infantes remain, and they're increasingly isolated\n\n\n\"The neutrals who worried about 'what if the King dies' - that concern evaporates. The nobles who wondered if you could build alliances - you just did, with one of Iberia's richest kingdoms. The question of whether you're serious about the crusade - Portuguese backing proves it.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you. \"Your Majesty, this might be the turning point. The Infantes come to the Council thinking they can sow doubt. Instead they'll face a king with papal blessing, popular support, 150 crusaders, Portuguese alliance, and enough money to fund a real war.\"\n\n\n\nAnnouncement Strategy\n\n\nÁlvaro leans forward. \"We should announce this at the November Council, not before. Maximum impact.\"\n\n\n\"Imagine: The Infantes arrive expecting to debate their case. Instead, the Council opens with:\"\n\n\nYour presentation of the papal crusade bull\n\nDisplay of the True Cross and Santiago's bone\n\nThe 150 white-clad crusaders receiving their clasps\n\nThen, the announcement: 'I am betrothed to Princess Isabel of Portugal, arriving in December'\n\n\n\"That sequence tells a story: This king has divine backing, popular support, military force, international alliance, and secured succession. The Infantes look like relics of an old dispute, not serious threats.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"And Your Majesty, you'll finally have answer about Isabel of Portugal - who she is, what she's like. They sent a portrait?\"\n\n\nAdmiral Diego nods. \"Yes, Your Majesty, in my saddlebags. Also letters from Princess Isabel herself and from her ladies describing her character and interests.\"\n\n\nHe retrieves a wrapped package. Inside is a small painted portrait on wood panel - a young woman with dark hair, serious brown eyes, wearing simple but fine clothing. Not stunning beauty, but pleasant features. She looks... earnest. Intelligent. Perhaps a bit nervous, as if the painter caught her mid-thought.\n\n\nAlso two letters on fine paper with feminine handwriting.\n\n\n\nIt's now October 25, 1430. The Council is fourteen days away.\n\n\nYou have:\n\n\nPapal crusade bull\n\n151 crusaders equipped and trained\n\nPortuguese betrothal secured (Princess arrives December)\n\nAlfonso interested but cautious\n\nThe Infantes accepting safe conduct\n\nCaptain Fernán's full intelligence report\n\nSubstantial treasury (162,000 florins from earlier + 180,000 Portuguese dowry incoming = 342,000 florins total)\n\n\nEverything is converging on November 8th."

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed diplomatic risks and strategic benefits of Aragonese alliance.\n\nThis is a good strategic question from Juan. Let me think about the pros and cons of announcing the Aragonese negotiations at the Council.\n\nPROS:\n- Shows diplomatic sophistication\n- Demonstrates he's building alliances on multiple fronts\n- Puts pressure on the Infantes (their own brother Alfonso is negotiating with Juan)\n- Shows strength and momentum\n- Suggests the kingdom will be secure from external threats\n\nCONS:\n- Alfonso only said he's \"interested but cautious\" - not a done deal yet\n- Might look like overreach if Alfonso hasn't actually committed\n- Could embarrass Alfonso if announced before he's ready\n- The Infantes might spin it as \"the King is giving concessions to our brother\"\n- Announcing negotiations before they're concluded can complicate them\n\nÁlvaro would likely see both sides and present them clearly without being overly directive. He'd probably lean toward either:\n1. Mentioning it but carefully (\"in discussions with Aragon about future cooperation\")\n2. Or waiting until it's more concrete\n\nThis is a reasonable strategic question and Álvaro would engage with it seriously.\n\n\nStrategic Announcement Discussion\n\n\nRoyal Chambers, Seville, October 25, 1430\n\n\n\nÁlvaro pauses, considering your question carefully. \"Your Majesty, that's astute thinking. Let me work through the advantages and risks.\"\n\n\nHe begins pacing. \"Announcing Aragonese negotiations could indeed show that you're securing both flanks - Portugal to the west, Aragon to the east. It demonstrates diplomatic sophistication and momentum.\"\n\n\nArguments For:\n\n\n\"First, it puts enormous pressure on the Infantes. Imagine their position: They stand before the Council, and you announce 'I'm in negotiations with your brother Alfonso for Mediterranean partnership.' That tells everyone: even their own family sees more value in alliance with you than in protecting them.\"\n\n\n\"Second, it shows the nobles you're thinking strategically - not just about internal conflicts but about Castile's position in broader Iberian and Mediterranean politics.\"\n\n\n\"Third, it adds to the narrative of momentum: papal backing, popular support, crusader force, Portuguese marriage, AND potential Aragonese cooperation. Everything pointing one direction.\"\n\n\nArguments Against:\n\n\nÁlvaro's face grows more cautious. \"However, there are real risks.\"\n\n\n\"Alfonso only said he's interested pending the Council's outcome. He explicitly didn't commit. If you announce negotiations before they're concluded, and then Alfonso backs away or demands terms you can't accept, it looks like failure.\"\n\n\n\"Also, announcing it publicly before Alfonso is ready could complicate the negotiations. Kings don't like having their diplomatic deliberations announced before they've made decisions. It might irritate him.\"\n\n\nHe sits down. \"And the Infantes could spin it: 'The King is so desperate he's offering our brother Castilian resources for his Italian wars. He's giving away the kingdom's strength to buy Alfonso's neutrality.' Some nobles might see it as weakness rather than strength.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's Recommendation:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I suggest a middle approach. Don't announce formal negotiations, but mention it obliquely:\"\n\n\nHe phrases it carefully: \"'We have written to King Alfonso of Aragon proposing partnership for our mutual Mediterranean interests. We await his response with hope for cooperation between our kingdoms.'\"\n\n\n\"That's truthful, shows initiative, puts some pressure on the Infantes, but doesn't overcommit. It's 'I reached out' not 'we have a deal.'\"\n\n\n\"If anyone asks for details, you can say: 'These matters are under discussion. We remain optimistic.' Diplomatic without being specific.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you. \"Alternatively, we could wait until Alfonso actually commits before announcing anything. More cautious but safer.\"\n\n\n\"What's your instinct, Your Majesty?\""

That's just... what happened. And it makes a powerful point without overcommitting.\"\n\n\nThe Impact on the Infantes:\n\n\n\"When you say this at the Council, the Infantes hear: 'My brother-in-law welcomed me in his city. His subjects supported my crusade. His wife, my sister, stands with me. We're in friendly communication.' That subtly suggests Alfonso is not automatically on their side.\"\n\n\n\"But you're not claiming he's abandoned them or made formal alliance. You're just stating that relations with Aragon are constructive.\"\n\n\nThe Impact on Neutrals:\n\n\n\"The nobles hear: This king traveled to Aragon, was well-received, built support, and is now in diplomatic contact with Alfonso. That shows sophistication. It shows he can build bridges rather than just make enemies.\"\n\n\n\"Combined with the Portuguese betrothal, it paints a picture: Juan is connecting with Portugal to the west, maintaining good relations with Aragon to the east, and securing papal backing from Rome. He's thinking like a king who understands international politics, not just fighting internal battles.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro grins. \"And it's all true. That's the beauty of it. You're not exaggerating or spinning - you're simply describing what actually occurred.\"\n\n\n\"I think this is perfect, Your Majesty. Mention Barcelona's warm reception, your sister's support, ongoing diplomatic discussions with Alfonso, and that you're optimistic about cooperation between the kingdoms.

He found a kingdom on edge - the Infantes' rebellion had failed but left the realm divided, with nobles watching cautiously to see who would emerge stronger.\n\n\n\nMajor Developments\n\n\nThe Granada Diplomatic Mission (September 28)\n\n\nAmbassador Abu Abdullah al-Zaghal arrived with generous peace terms:\n\n\nDouble tribute (100,000 dinars annually)\n\nReturn of 300 Christian captives\n\nTrade privileges and limited missionary activity\n\nWarning that Granada had received massive Muslim support (220,000 dinars in gold, 8,000+ troops, Ottoman cannon technology)\n\n\nJuan's Response: Respectfully declined, citing sacred papal obligation. Had the crusade bull read in full, offered personal conversion to al-Zaghal. The ambassador departed with gifts returned but promised Granada wouldn't attack during Castile's internal troubles.\n\n\nThe Noble Assembly (September 28, Evening)\n\n\nJuan addressed ~80 nobles in Seville, presenting:\n\n\nEvidence of the Infantes' plotting (witnessed by Archbishop and Marquis)\n\nHis father's sword with Non Nobis Domine inscription\n\nLetters of recommendation from Church authorities\n\nThe papal crusade bull read in full\n\nHis renunciation before Pope Martin V\n\n\nResult: FAILURE - Only minimal gains (3-4 nobles shifted from neutral to supportive). Total alignment remained: 32-35% pro-Juan, 15-20% pro-Infantes, 50% neutral.\n\n\nThe Problem Identified: Nobles believed Juan's story but were paralyzed by practical concerns - the failed arrest, Alfonso V's threat, Juan's lack of heir, impossibility of fighting both Infantes AND Granada.\n\n\nStrategic Planning with Álvaro (September 28-29)\n\n\nMarriage Decision: Portuguese alliance chosen over Aragonese or French options. Portugal offered stability, neutrality, wealth, and naval power without threatening Alfonso V or strengthening one Castilian faction over others.\n\n\nDiplomatic Initiative: Letter sent to Alfonso V proposing:\n\n\nSupport for his Italian ambitions (troops, ships, money, diplomatic backing)\n\nIn exchange for respecting Castilian sovereignty over the Infantes matter\n\nPersonal meeting when duties permit\n\nFramed as mutual strategic benefit, not abandoning his brothers\n\n\nPublic Announcement: Safe conduct granted to Infantes for November 8 Council, publicly framed as king seeking peaceful resolution.\n\n\nBuilding the Crusader Infrastructure (September 29-30)\n\n\nThe Crusader Clasps: Commissioned and completed by Master Alonso Ruiz:\n\n\n150 common iron clasps (cross with \"GRANADA\")\n\n10 commander bronze/silver clasps (cross with aureole)\n\nSupreme commander clasp (silver-gilt sword with Non Nobis Domine, garnets, circle)\n\n8 chaplain silver clasps (book design)\n\nTotal: 2,350 maravedís\n\n\nNew Tier Created: \"Learned Crusaders\" - soldiers like Brother Guillem who provide spiritual support without being ordained chaplains. Ordered 20 special clasps combining cross and book symbols.\n\n\nChaplain Corps Expanded:\n\n\nFrom Barcelona: Brother Tomás Rodríguez (Franciscan), Father Miquel Serra (Dominican)\n\nRecruited in Seville: Father Alfonso de Palencia (Benedictine), Brother Juan Sánchez (secular priest)\n\nTotal: 5 chaplains with more in discussion\n\nRatio: 1 chaplain per ~30 crusaders (exceptional)\n\n\nMeeting the Chaplains: Juan personally met Brother Tomás (warm, pastoral, \"the Kind\") and Father Miquel (learned, canon law expert, Arabic speaker). Both committed to the vision of mercy and justice in crusade.\n\n\nThe Plaza de San Francisco Speech (October 2)\n\n\nJuan gave a public address to 8,000-10,000 people:\n\n\nPersonal narrative of journey to Rome\n\nDisplay of the white banner with True Cross and Santiago relics\n\nCall for participation (shelter, donations, or service as crusaders)\n\nPractical benefits (peace, trade) alongside spiritual appeal\n\nDrew sword: \"I will succeed or I will die trying.

If Council divided, they survive to fight on.\n\n\nGranada: Far stronger than expected with unprecedented Muslim world support. 24,000-25,000 troops when fully assembled, 20-25 war galleys, Ottoman technology. This is now jihad vs. crusade, not simple conquest. But honorably not attacking during internal crisis.\n\n\nNoble Neutrality: 50% of nobility still uncommitted. The Council is the decisive moment - either they unite behind Juan or the fracture continues.\n\n\n\nKey Themes\n\n\nBuilding Alliances: Juan systematically secured Portuguese marriage and began Aragonese negotiations, thinking strategically about Castile's international position.\n\n\nPopular vs. Elite Support: Strong among common people and crusaders, weak among cautious nobility. The gap between bottom-up and top-down support creates tension.\n\n\nFaith and Pragmatism: Continued exploration of mixing genuine religious devotion with calculated political strategy. The chaplain corps embodies commitment to crusade's spiritual dimension.\n\n\nThe Weight of Sacred Responsibility: Carrying papal authority, True Cross, and crusade mandate places enormous burden on 18-year-old king.\n\n\nUnity vs. Division: Every decision aims at unifying kingdom for crusade, but political realities keep creating obstacles.\n\n\n\nCharacter Development\n\n\nJuan: Demonstrated resilience after initial noble assembly disappointment. Learned to build multiple strategies simultaneously (marriage, diplomacy, popular support, military force). Growing into kingship through adaptive thinking rather than rigid plans.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna: Remained crucial strategic advisor, helping Juan see opportunities where others saw obstacles (turning failed noble assembly into catalyst for new approaches).\n\n\nThe Chaplains: Brother Tomás and Father Miquel emerged as key spiritual infrastructure. Their different styles (pastoral vs. canonical) complement each other and shape crusader culture.\n\n\nThe Crusaders: 151 men genuinely committed to vision of mercy and justice. Not perfect, but spiritually formed beyond typical military force. Marco, Andrea, Giovanni, Brother Guillem and others becoming distinct personalities.\n\n\n\nLooking Ahead\n\n\nNovember 8, 1430 looms as the decisive moment. Everything Juan has built - papal backing, popular support, crusader force, Portuguese alliance, diplomatic outreach - will be tested before the assembled nobility.\n\n\nThe Infantes will make their case. The nobles will judge. The kingdom's future - united for crusade or fractured by civil conflict - hangs in the balance.\n\n\nVictory at the Council opens path to Granada. Defeat or division means years of internal conflict while the Muslim world rallies behind Granada's banner.\n\n\nThe young king has prepared as well as possible. Now he must deliver when it matters most.\n\n\n\nEND OF CHAPTER 7 SUMMARY"
