I need to search the project files to find where they left off in their last conversation.\n\nLet me search for the most recent chapter and information about conversations with Álvaro regarding revenue.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process\n\nGood, I found information about Chapter 26. Let me search for more specific details about where they left off in the conversation with Álvaro about crown revenue.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process\n\nI found information about Chapter 23, but I need to find Chapter 26 specifically where the conversation with Álvaro about crown revenue left off. Let me look at the end of Chapter 26 more carefully.\n\n\nView: Reading the complete Chapter 26 summary to find where the conversation with Álvaro about crown revenue ended\n\n\nThought process: Synthesized historical revenue data and prepared narrative continuation.\n\nPerfect! I now have the complete Chapter 26 summary. The chapter ended with Juan and Álvaro discussing:\n\n1. The crown's current annual revenue (28.3 million maravedís = 106,800 florins)\n2. The breakdown of revenue sources\n3. The impact of reforms - showing that tax reform + Granada conquest would nearly double annual revenue from 107,000 to 150,000 florins\n4. The strategic vision of using crusade powers while they last\n5. The \"Eternal Crusade\" concept of continuing to Africa\n6. Plans for the upcoming Cortes (November 15, 1431)\n\nThe conversation appears to have concluded with the discussion of revenue projections and the strategic implications. Since this is Chapter 27 and the user wants to continue the conversation with Álvaro about crown revenue, I should pick up where they left off - presumably still in late October 1431, discussing these revenue and reform matters.\n\nLet me start by checking the character tracker to see Álvaro's current status and any other relevant information.\n\n\nView: Checking the character tracker for Álvaro de Luna's current status and any other relevant characters\n\n\nThought process: Reconstructed narrative context and prepared revenue discussion continuation.\n\nGood, I have context on Álvaro. The character tracker hasn't been updated since Chapter 18, but I know from Chapter 26 that:\n- It's late October 1431\n- Juan and Álvaro have been discussing crown revenue, taxation reform, and the upcoming Cortes (November 15, 1431)\n- They discussed the current revenue (106,800 florins annually) and projected increases from reforms (to 150,000 florins)\n\nThe last conversation in Chapter 26 ended with them having discussed:\n1. Current crown revenue sources and amounts\n2. Impact of proposed reforms (8% tax + Granada revenues)\n3. The strategic timing and political implications\n\nSince the user wants to continue this conversation, I should pick up naturally where they left off. Álvaro would likely be ready to discuss implementation details, or Juan might have follow-up questions about the revenue projections, the Cortes strategy, or specific aspects of the reform.\n\nI'll start by setting the scene - they're in Toledo, Royal Chambers, late October 1431, continuing their discussion about crown revenue and reform.\n\n\nCHAPTER 27: THE REVENUE QUESTION (CONTINUED)\n\n\nDate: Late October 1431\nLocation: Toledo, Royal Chambers\n\n\n\nÁlvaro sat back in his chair, one hand absently turning the wine cup on the table between you. The accounting documents lay spread before you both—columns of numbers showing the kingdom's finances in brutal clarity. 28.3 million maravedís in annual revenue. 106,800 florins. Adequate, but barely.\n\n\nThe silence stretched as he let the implications of the revenue projections settle. Nearly doubling the crown's income—from 107,000 to 150,000 florins annually—was the difference between survival and power. Between maintaining the status quo and funding the eternal crusade he'd just outlined.\n\n\nHe looked up, meeting your eyes. \"Your Majesty has questions.\"\n\n\nIt wasn't quite a question itself—more an observation. He knew you well enough by now to read when you were still working through something.\n\n\nThe afternoon light slanted through the western windows, casting long shadows across the chamber. Outside, Toledo went about its business—merchants calling their wares, church bells marking the hour, the distant sound of horses in the royal stables. But here, in this room, the future of Castile was being calculated in columns of maravedís and florins.\n\n\nWhat weighs on your mind?"

      "say": "Thought process: Excavated historical treasury data and structured expense categories.\n\nThe user is asking Juan to continue the conversation with Álvaro about crown expenses. This is a natural follow-up to the revenue discussion. I need to look at what information I have about crown expenses from the project files.\n\nFrom Chapter 24's treasury review, I found this information about expenses over 18 months:\n\n**Expenses (18 months):**\n- Royal household: ~12 million maravedís\n- Non-crusade military: ~10.5 million maravedís\n- Administration, diplomacy, judicial: ~7 million maravedís\n- Debt service: ~4.5 million maravedís\n- Miscellaneous: ~6 million maravedís\n- **Total: ~40 million maravedís (~150,943 florins)**\n\nSo for 18 months, total was about 40 million maravedís. That's about 26.67 million per year.\n\nLet me break this down to annual figures:\n- Royal household: ~8 million maravedís/year (30,189 florins)\n- Non-crusade military: ~7 million maravedís/year (26,415 florins)\n- Administration, diplomacy, judicial: ~4.67 million maravedís/year (17,610 florins)\n- Debt service: ~3 million maravedís/year (11,321 florins)\n- Miscellaneous: ~4 million maravedís/year (15,094 florins)\n- **Total: ~26.67 million maravedís/year (~100,629 florins)**\n\nBut the current crown annual revenue is stated as 28.3 million maravedís = 106,800 florins. So expenses should be slightly less than that to avoid deficit.\n\nActually, looking at the Chapter 26 summary, it says \"Treasury: 106,800 florins annual revenue, adequate but not abundant\" - this is revenue, not surplus. \n\nI'll refine the expense calculations to align more precisely with the crown's financial reality. By carefully adjusting the 18-month data, I can create a more accurate annual expense projection that matches the revenue constraints. This means carefully scaling down the existing expense categories to ensure the crown maintains financial stability.\n\n\nÁlvaro reached for another set of documents—these older, more worn from frequent reference. \"Crown expenses,\" he said, spreading them out. \"Annual breakdown, based on the last complete fiscal accounting.\"\n\n\nHe ran his finger down the columns, translating the numbers into clear categories.\n\n\n\"Royal Household: Approximately 8 million maravedís yearly—about 30,000 florins. This covers Your Majesty's personal expenses, the Queen's household, servants, court officials, royal residences maintenance, ceremonial expenses, hospitality for visiting dignitaries. It's... substantial, but not excessive by royal standards. The French kings spend three times that.\"\n\n\nHe moved to the next line.\n\n\n\"Non-Crusade Military: About 7 million maravedís—26,400 florins. This is frontier garrisons, castle guards, the royal guard, peacetime army. Doesn't include crusade forces—those come from the crusade treasury. But the kingdom still needs soldiers even without a crusade. Border defense, bandit suppression, maintaining fortresses.\"\n\n\nAnother line.\n\n\n\"Administration and Governance: Around 4.7 million maravedís—17,700 florins. Includes all the bureaucrats, tax collectors, judges, corregidors in cities, diplomatic missions, messengers, record-keepers. The entire machinery that keeps the kingdom functioning. Tommaso Parentucelli would call it efficient by Italian standards—their city-states spend far more on administration proportionally.\"\n\n\nHe paused at the next item, his expression tightening slightly.\n\n\n\"Debt Service: Currently about 3 million maravedís—11,300 florins. The 15 million in outstanding loans to Italian and Jewish bankers. We're paying it down, but slowly. Interest and principal payments.\"\n\n\n\"Miscellaneous and Contingency: About 4 million maravedís—15,000 florins. Everything else—repairs to royal property, unexpected expenses, gifts to nobles and clergy, supporting widows and orphans of royal servants, charitable obligations. The category that always grows when you're not watching it.\"\n\n\nHe sat back. \"Total: approximately 26.7 million maravedís annually. About 100,800 florins.\"\n\n\nHe tapped the revenue document. \"Revenue is 28.3 million—106,800 florins. That leaves a surplus of about 1.6 million maravedís yearly. Six thousand florins.\" His tone made clear what he thought of that margin. \"Barely enough to handle an unexpected crisis. One bad harvest, one diplomatic emergency requiring gifts, one fortress that needs urgent repairs... and we're in deficit.\"\n\n\nHe looked at you directly. \"So yes, Your Majesty, we need that revenue increase. Because right now, the crown has almost no room to maneuver.\"\n\n\nWhat aspect of these expenses draws your attention?"

      "say": "Thought process: Calculated crown's deployable troop capacity from budget constraints.\n\nThe user is asking about the crown's military capacity - specifically how many troops the crown can field with its own non-crusade military budget and resources.\n\nLooking at the information:\n- Non-Crusade Military budget: 7 million maravedís (26,400 florins) annually\n- This covers frontier garrisons, castle guards, royal guard, peacetime army\n\nFrom the campaign budget documents, I can see wage structures:\n- Professional Crown Soldier: 2 maravedís daily = 60 maravedís monthly\n- Various other rates for specialists\n\nLet me calculate this carefully:\n\nAnnual military budget: 7 million maravedís\nBut this isn't ALL for wages - it also covers:\n- Equipment maintenance\n- Fortifications upkeep\n- Supplies\n- Training\n- Infrastructure\n\nHistorically, wages might be 50-60% of military budget, the rest being infrastructure, equipment, supplies.\n\nLet's say 4 million maravedís for actual troop wages (conservative estimate)\nAt 60 maravedís per month per soldier = 720 maravedís per year\n4,000,000 / 720 = ~5,555 troops\n\nBut this seems like it might include:\n- Permanent garrisons (spread across many fortresses)\n- Royal guard (maybe 200-300 men)\n- Mobile forces\n\nÁlvaro would break this down into:\n1. What's currently deployed (garrisons, border defense)\n2. What could be mobilized for a campaign\n3. The difference between peacetime and wartime deployment\n\nThe royal guard is probably ~200-300 men\nFrontier garrisons across Castile might be 3,000-4,000 spread thin\nThat leaves maybe 1,000-2,000 for mobile operations\n\nThis is WITHOUT the crusade, which is why they needed:\n- Noble levies (feudal obligation)\n- Military Order forces\n- Crusader recruitment\n- Mercenaries\n\n\nThe crown's standing military is fundamentally limited, with minimal independent capacity to field a substantial force. The core military strength relies heavily on supplementary recruitment methods, making the permanent troops a mere skeleton of potential military power.\n\n\nÁlvaro pulled the military expense document closer, considering the question carefully.\n\n\n\"The crown's own forces—meaning troops paid directly from the royal treasury, not counting feudal levies or crusader volunteers?\" He began calculating aloud.\n\n\n\"With 7 million maravedís yearly, we're not fielding a large army. That budget covers multiple things: garrison wages across dozens of fortresses, equipment maintenance, supplies, fortification repairs. The actual wage portion is perhaps 4 to 4.5 million maravedís.\"\n\n\nHe worked through the numbers. \"A professional soldier costs roughly 60 maravedís monthly—720 yearly. So theoretically, about 5,500 to 6,000 men total. But that's theoretical. In practice...\"\n\n\nHe held up a hand, counting on his fingers.\n\n\n\"Royal Guard: Your personal guard—maybe 250 to 300 men. Elite, well-paid, always with you. Captain Fernán commands them.\n\n\nFrontier Garrisons: The real drain. We have fortresses along the Granadan border, the Portuguese border, the Aragonese border, Navarre. Plus major cities need royal troops—Toledo, Burgos, Seville. Spread across perhaps thirty to forty significant positions, that's... 3,000 to 3,500 men minimum. Can't pull them without leaving positions vulnerable.\n\n\nMobile Reserve: What's left for actual campaigns. Perhaps 1,500 to 2,000 troops at most that can be concentrated without abandoning critical positions.\"\n\n\nHe grimaced. \"Your Majesty sees the problem. The crown's own military is quite small. This is why we rely on the feudal system—why nobles must provide troops as part of their obligations. The Duke of Medina Sidonia brings 500 men, the Count of Benavente brings 400, the Master of Santiago commands 1,500 Order knights...\"\n\n\n\"For the Granada crusade, we field 35,000 troops total. Of those, perhaps 3,500 to 4,000 are crown forces—including the crusaders we recruited and are paying from crusade funds. The rest are noble levies paying their feudal dues, or Military Order forces.\"\n\n\nHe leaned forward. \"This is also why the extended levy service has been so financially painful for the nobles. Normally, they provide their 40 days and go home. We're asking for eight months—six times the normal obligation. After their 40 days, they're paying their own men out of pocket.\"\n\n\nA pause. \"And why reforming noble taxation is so critical. If we could actually collect what they owe, we could afford a larger standing royal army. Less dependent on feudal levies. More flexibility.\"\n\n\nHe met your eyes. \"Right now, without calling feudal levies, the crown could field perhaps 2,000 troops for an actual campaign. Adequate for suppressing a rebellion or handling bandits. Completely inadequate for conquering Granada.\"\n\n\nWhat does this make you consider?"

Let me think through this carefully from Álvaro's perspective.\n\nKey factors:\n1. Population - France has significantly more people\n2. Land quality and agriculture - France has better farmland\n3. Trade - France has access to Mediterranean and Atlantic, plus internal trade\n4. Administrative efficiency - French royal administration more developed\n5. Royal domain - French kings control more direct territory\n6. Taxation system - French kings have better tax collection\n7. Economic development - More cities, more trade, more wealth\n8. The Hundred Years War has actually strengthened French royal power in some ways\n\nÁlvaro would be knowledgeable about this and could explain it clearly but also in a way that doesn't make Castile seem hopeless. He'd acknowledge French advantages while noting Castilian opportunities.\n\nI should keep this to 2-4 paragraphs since we're in active conversation, not a journey or scene-setting moment.\n\n\nÁlvaro gave a rueful smile at that. \"Ah, Your Majesty joins a long list of Iberian kings asking that question.\"\n\n\nHe refilled both wine cups before continuing. \"France is simply... richer. More people—perhaps twelve million souls to our four or five million. More cities, more trade, better farmland. The French countryside produces wealth that Castile cannot match. Their noble estates generate more revenue, which means their nobles pay more in taxes, which means the king has more to spend.\"\n\n\nHe gestured broadly. \"The Kingdom of France also benefits from centuries of royal centralization. They've built a tax system that actually works—the taille, the salt tax, customs duties that are enforced rather than evaded. Their bureaucracy is more developed. And ironically, the Hundred Years' War has strengthened royal power. When you're fighting for survival, nobles accept royal authority they'd resist in peacetime. Charles VII has used the English threat to build a permanent army funded by permanent taxation.\"\n\n\nA slight shrug. \"Meanwhile, Castile has spent two centuries fighting itself as much as Granada. Civil wars, noble rebellions, disputed successions. Every generation, some faction tries to tear the kingdom apart. Hard to build wealth when you're constantly bleeding it away in internal conflicts.\"\n\n\nBut then his expression shifted—less envious, more calculating. \"However, Your Majesty, consider this: France is richer, yes, but France is also exhausted. They've been at war for ninety years. Their countryside is devastated. Joan of Arc rallied them, but they're still years from victory, and victory will leave them drained.\"\n\n\nHe tapped the table. \"Castile has problems, but we also have potential. Granada's wealth waiting to be absorbed. African trade routes across the strait. The Atlantic coast that no one is truly exploiting yet. Our merchants in Seville and Burgos are hungry and ambitious. If we can stabilize the kingdom, reform taxation, end the internal fighting...\"\n\n\nHe met your eyes. \"We may never be as rich as France. But we could be rich enough. And perhaps more importantly—united and directed, where France is weary.\"\n\n\nDoes this perspective shift your thinking?"

This is a historical demographics question.\n\nLet me think about what would be historically accurate for 15th century Iberia:\n\nCastile in the 15th century: The Kingdom of Castile (including León) was the largest kingdom in Iberia. Population estimates for this period vary, but most scholars suggest:\n- Castile and León combined: approximately 4-5 million in the early-mid 15th century\n- This would include all territories under the Castilian crown\n\nAragon in the 15th century: The Crown of Aragon (including Catalonia, Valencia, and Aragon proper) was smaller:\n- Crown of Aragon total: approximately 1-1.5 million\n- Catalonia was the most populous part, maybe 400,000-500,000\n- Valencia perhaps 250,000-300,000\n- Aragon proper perhaps 250,000-300,000\n\nSo combined, the Spanish kingdoms (not counting Navarre, Granada, or Portugal) would be roughly 5-6.5 million.\n\nFor comparison:\n- France: 12-15 million (significantly larger)\n- England: 2-3 million\n- Italian states combined: 7-10 million\n- Holy Roman Empire: 12-15 million\n\nGranada would add maybe 300,000-500,000 Muslims\n\nPortugal would be another 1-1.5 million\n\nÁlvaro would know these rough figures, though medieval population estimates were imprecise. He'd be aware that Castile is the dominant kingdom in Iberia by population, and that combined the Spanish kingdoms are still smaller than France.\n\n\nÁlvaro nodded. \"Castile proper—the kingdom you rule—has perhaps four to five million souls. It's difficult to know precisely. We don't count heads the way the Romans did. But based on tax records, parish registers, estimates from bishops... four to five million is reasonable.\"\n\n\nHe considered the second question. \"Aragon is smaller. The Crown of Aragon—Aragon proper, Catalonia, Valencia combined—perhaps one to one and a half million. Catalonia is the most populous, maybe half a million. Valencia perhaps a quarter million. Aragon proper another quarter million or so.\"\n\n\nHe did the mental arithmetic. \"So together, Castile and Aragon... five and a half to six and a half million. Still only half what France has.\"\n\n\nA pause, then he added: \"Granada probably has another three to four hundred thousand—mostly concentrated around the capital and coastal cities. Portugal has perhaps a million to a million and a half. Navarre is tiny—maybe one hundred fifty thousand at most.\"\n\n\nHe leaned back. \"All of Iberia together—Castile, Aragon, Portugal, Navarre, Granada—perhaps eight to nine million souls. France alone has twelve million, maybe more. The Holy Roman Empire similar numbers, though they're hopelessly fragmented. The Italian city-states combined might be seven to ten million, but they're wealthy because of trade—Venice and Florence punch far above their population.\"\n\n\nHis expression turned thoughtful. \"But Your Majesty, consider: Castile alone has nearly as many people as all of Aragon. When Isabel and Ferdinand eventually marry and unite the kingdoms...\"—he caught himself—\"if such a thing were to happen in the future, Castile would clearly dominate. We're already the larger, stronger kingdom.\"\n\n\n\"And once Granada falls? We absorb another half million subjects, control all the trade routes, gain the richest farmland in the south...\" He smiled slightly. \"France may be richer now. But the potential is here.\"\n\n\nDoes this population reality affect your strategic thinking?"

Juan is thinking strategically about how to modernize Castile's revenue system by learning from France. Álvaro would be knowledgeable about French taxation and could explain both the opportunities and challenges of adopting similar systems.\n\nThe main French taxes in this period:\n1. The taille (direct tax on non-nobles)\n2. The gabelle (salt tax)\n3. Customs and trade taxes\n4. Aids and subsidies\n\nÁlvaro would need to explain:\n- What makes the French system work\n- Why it would be difficult to implement in Castile\n- What elements could be adapted\n- The political challenges\n- How it relates to the crusade tax reform they're already planning\n\nThis should be a substantial response since it's a complex administrative topic, but I should stop at a natural point for Juan to respond.\n\n\nÁlvaro's eyes lit up—this was clearly a topic he'd considered before. \"Your Majesty, I've thought about this extensively. The French system has elements worth studying, certainly.\"\n\n\nHe began ticking off points. \"The French taille is their main direct tax—levied on commoners, not nobles. It's assessed on households or land value, collected regularly, and most importantly, it's permanent. Not negotiated each time. The king simply declares the rate, and it's collected. They also have the gabelle—the salt tax—which generates enormous revenue because everyone needs salt. It's a monopoly. You must buy salt from royal warehouses at royal prices.\"\n\n\nHe leaned forward. \"Why does it work in France? Several reasons. First, the English threat. When you're being invaded, people accept taxation they'd resist in peacetime. 'We need money to defend the kingdom'—hard to argue with that. Second, Charles VII has built a professional bureaucracy to collect it. Thousands of officials, standardized procedures, regional courts to enforce payment. Third—and this is critical—the French nobles accepted it, because they're exempt from most of it. They don't pay the taille. Commoners do.\"\n\n\nHe sat back, considering. \"Could we copy it? Parts of it, perhaps. But we'd face significant challenges.\"\n\n\n\"First challenge: No immediate existential threat.\" He held up a hand. \"Yes, Granada exists, but they're not besieging Toledo. The French accepted taxation because English armies were burning their farms. We'd need to convince people that Granada justifies permanent taxation—which is partly why the crusade tax is so important right now.\"\n\n\n\"Second: Our nobles would resist fiercely.\" He grimaced. \"The French nobility accepted permanent commoner taxation because they're exempt. If we tried to tax commoners heavily while nobles pay ancient fixed amounts, we'd have riots. But if we tax nobles fairly—which we're trying to do with the 8% crusade tax—they'll fight us every step. They're already resisting.\"\n\n\n\"Third: We lack the bureaucracy.\" He spread his hands. \"France has built this system over decades. We have... tax assessors with letters who get threatened with clubs. We'd need hundreds of trained officials, regional treasury offices, courts to handle disputes, armed enforcers. That infrastructure doesn't exist yet.\"\n\n\nHe paused, then continued more thoughtfully. \"However... Your Majesty, the crusade gives us an opportunity. We're already building that bureaucracy. The crusade tax requires assessment, collection, enforcement. We're training officials, establishing procedures, creating precedents. Cardinal Capranica's oversight structure is essentially a treasury bureaucracy.\"\n\n\nHis voice gained energy. \"And the 8% crusade tax on nobles? That's more progressive than the French system. If we can make it work—if we can actually collect it, enforce it, and make nobles accept it—then when the crusade ends, we'll have proven the system functions. We'll have the officials in place, the procedures established, the nobles grudgingly accustomed to paying a percentage rather than ancient fixed amounts.\"\n\n\n\"At that point, we could argue: 'The crusade tax worked. Let's make a version of it permanent. Eight percent during active crusade, perhaps five percent for kingdom defense in peacetime.' Nobles would howl, but we'd have precedent and infrastructure.\"\n\n\nHe grew more animated. \"We could add a salt monopoly—the gabelle. Relatively easy to enforce since there are limited sources. Generates steady revenue from everyone. Add customs duties at borders and ports—we're already collecting some, but we could standardize and increase them. Streamline the alcabala—our sales tax—which currently loses two million maravedís to corruption.\"\n\n\n\"The key,\" he said intently, \"is building it gradually but permanently. Use the crusade as the crucible. Prove the system works. Then, when Granada falls and we no longer have papal authority backing us, we don't dismantle it—we transform it. 'The crusade tax becomes the defense tax. The assessment system becomes the royal revenue system. The bureaucracy stays in place.'\"\n\n\nHe met your eyes. \"France took decades to build their system. We might do it faster—because we're doing it under crusade authority when resistance is weakest. By the time nobles realize we've built a French-style tax state, it will be too late. The machinery will already be running.\"\n\n\nA slight smile. \"Of course, this requires that we actually win the crusade and survive the political backlash. But yes, Your Majesty—we could absolutely build something like the French system. We're already beginning to.\"\n\n\nWhat aspect of this interests you most?"

      "say": "Thought process: Examined strategic implications of military orders' post-conquest relevance and control.\n\nThis is an excellent and perceptive question from Juan. The Military Orders - Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara - are indeed a major power bloc with enormous resources, and their traditional purpose (fighting Granada) will end when the crusade succeeds.\n\nHistorically, this became a massive issue. The Orders controlled vast estates, had independent military forces, and were technically under their own Grand Masters who answered to the Pope, not directly to the crown. After Granada fell in 1492, the Catholic Monarchs worked hard to bring them under royal control.\n\nÁlvaro would definitely have thought about this. It's a huge opportunity but also a potential problem. Let me think about what he'd say:\n\n1. The Orders are not going away automatically - they have charters, papal backing, enormous wealth\n2. Juan has the power under the papal bull to appoint Masters - THIS IS HUGE\n3. Once Granada falls, does he lose that power? Probably yes\n4. So he needs to use it while he has it\n5. Options: \n   - Redirect them to Africa (eternal crusade concept)\n   - Bring them under royal control\n   - Reform their purpose\n   - Actually, Juan already appointed loyal people - Don Rodrigo de Perea as Master of Santiago, etc.\n\nLet me check what happened with the Orders in the campaign...\n\nFrom the documents, I can see that Juan has already used his papal authority to appoint Masters. The current situation seems to be that the Orders are serving in the crusade. But what happens after?\n\nÁlvaro would point out:\n1. Their function is NOT over if crusade continues to Africa\n2. But even if it were, they have massive resources\n3. Juan has temporary power to control appointments\n4. Need to make that permanent somehow\n5. Could argue for royal control \"since crusading function ended\"\n6. Or keep them relevant with new missions\n\nThis is a very sophisticated question showing Juan is thinking strategically about post-conquest power structures.\n\n\nÁlvaro went very still. Then a slow smile spread across his face. \"Your Majesty asks one of the most important questions about the post-crusade order.\"\n\n\nHe set down his wine cup and leaned forward intently.\n\n\n\"The three Military Orders—Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara—control approximately one-fifth of Castile's territory. Perhaps more. Enormous estates, fortresses, thousands of knights, independent military forces. They have papal charters making them answer to Rome, not to you. Their Grand Masters wield power rivaling any duke.\"\n\n\nHe paused. \"And yes, once Granada falls... their original purpose is fulfilled. No more Moors to fight in Iberia. What then?\"\n\n\n\"Several possibilities,\" he continued, counting on his fingers. \"First: They don't simply disappear. Their charters are perpetual. They'll argue they're still needed—for defense, for piety, for whatever justification keeps them relevant and keeps their lands. They'll find new purposes.\"\n\n\n\"Second: The eternal crusade.\" His eyes gleamed. \"If we continue crusading into Africa, as you proposed for the Cortes, then their function continues. They remain crusading orders actively fighting infidels. They stay relevant, keep their purpose, keep their lands and power.\"\n\n\n\"Third—and this is critical: Under the papal bull, Your Majesty has authority to appoint the Masters of the Orders during the crusade. You've already used this—Don Rodrigo de Perea as Master of Santiago, Don Pedro González de Padilla as Master of Calatrava. These are your appointments. Loyal men.\"\n\n\nHe leaned even closer. \"But that authority ends when the crusade ends. Once you sing Te Deum in Granada and the last mosque becomes a church, you lose that power. The Orders revert to their normal election process, or the Pope appoints Masters. You lose control.\"\n\n\nHis voice became urgent. \"Which means, Your Majesty, you have a narrow window. While the crusade lasts, you can reshape the Orders entirely. Appoint Masters who will be loyal to the crown. Reform their structures. Change their charters—with papal backing, which you currently have. Make them dependent on royal favor rather than independent of it.\"\n\n\n\"The French kings did this. They brought the Templars to heel before... well, before they destroyed them entirely. The Spanish Orders are less controversial, but the principle is the same. Use your emergency powers now to establish permanent crown control.\"\n\n\nHe counted options on his fingers again. \"Option One: Redirect them permanently to Africa and overseas crusading. Keep them busy, keep them justified, keep them away from Castilian politics. Permanent warriors for the eternal crusade—still crusading orders, but now serving your strategic vision.\"\n\n\n\"Option Two: Incorporate them into crown military structure. After Granada falls, declare that since their crusading purpose is fulfilled in Iberia, their knights should become part of the royal army. They keep some autonomy, but serve under royal command. Their estates remain theirs, but they owe direct service to you.\"\n\n\n\"Option Three: Negotiate royal mastership. This is what Ferdinand and Isabella eventually did—convince the Pope that the king should hold the masterships permanently. The Orders remain, but the crown controls them directly through perpetual appointment.\"\n\n\n\"Option Four: Dissolve them and seize their lands.\" He said this carefully. \"This would be... difficult. Very difficult. The Church would object. The knights would resist. But if you had strong papal support, if you could argue they were no longer needed...\" He shook his head. \"Risky. More likely to cause problems than solve them.\"\n\n\nHe sat back. \"My recommendation? The eternal crusade combined with crown mastership. Redirect them to Africa—give them new purpose, new lands to conquer, new glory to win. But ensure that you continue appointing the Masters. Argue to the Pope that since this is still crusade activity, your appointment power should continue. Build it into the structure permanently.\"\n\n\n\"This keeps them useful, keeps them out of Castilian factional politics, and keeps them under your control. They remain crusading orders with legitimate purpose. But they serve your vision, not their own.\"\n\n\nHe met your eyes directly. \"The Orders are dangerous if independent. They're incredibly valuable if controlled. Your Majesty has perhaps two or three years—however long until Granada completely falls—to make that control permanent. After that, the window closes.\"\n\n\nA pause. \"This is why the Cortes strategy matters so much. When you unveil the eternal crusade vision, you're not just inspiring nobles—you're giving the Military Orders a reason to continue existing under your authority. They'll embrace it because the alternative is irrelevance.\"\n\n\nWhat do you think of this approach?"

Juan wants to examine the founding documents of the Military Orders to see if there are any clauses about their dissolution or what happens when their purpose is fulfilled. This is smart - looking for legal/textual leverage.\n\nI should have Álvaro respond to this request. He would likely:\n1. Confirm such documents exist\n2. Be impressed by Juan's legal thinking\n3. Either summarize what he knows or suggest retrieving the actual documents\n4. This could involve using tools to research the historical founding charters\n\nLet me think about what the actual historical founding documents said:\n- Order of Santiago: Founded 1170, papal bull by Pope Alexander III\n- Order of Calatrava: Founded 1158, confirmed by Pope Alexander III in 1164\n- Order of Alcántara: Founded 1156 as Order of San Julián del Pereiro, renamed 1218\n\nThese were founded to fight Muslims in Iberia during the Reconquista. Their charters would have focused on that purpose. The question of what happens when that purpose is fulfilled is an excellent one that Juan is asking.\n\nI should probably use web_search to find information about the actual founding documents and whether they had dissolution clauses, since this is specific historical information that would be important to get right.\n\n\nÁlvaro sat up straighter, clearly impressed. \"Your Majesty, that's... that's precisely the kind of thinking that wins legal battles.\"\n\n\nHe stood and walked to a shelf, running his fingers along several document cases. \"The founding charters exist, yes. Copies in various archives—Toledo, Rome, the Orders' own chapter houses. I don't have them here immediately, but I know their general content. However, the specific legal language...\" He turned back. \"That would be worth examining closely.\"\n\n\nHe returned to his seat, thinking aloud. \"The Order of Santiago was founded in 1170 by papal bull from Alexander III. Calatrava earlier—1158, confirmed by papal bull in 1164. Alcántara started as the Order of San Julián del Pereiro in 1156, renamed in 1218.\"\n\n\n\"Their stated purpose in the founding documents was explicitly to fight the Muslims in Iberia. To defend Christian territories, to push back the Moors, to protect pilgrims. That was their raison d'être. The language is quite specific—they are crusading orders for the Reconquista.\"\n\n\nHe leaned forward. \"Your Majesty is asking the right question: Do those charters specify what happens when that purpose is fulfilled? I don't recall seeing dissolution clauses, but...\" He paused thoughtfully. \"If the founding purpose is explicitly 'fight the Moors in Iberia' and there are no more Moors in Iberia to fight...\"\n\n\n\"This could be very powerful leverage. If we can demonstrate that their charter purpose is complete, and there's no provision for continuing beyond that purpose...\"\n\n\nHe looked at you intently. \"Would Your Majesty like me to retrieve the actual founding documents? I can send for copies from Toledo's archives, or request them from the Orders themselves—they'd have to comply with a royal request. It might take a few days, but this could be crucial for the legal argument after Granada falls.\"\n\n\n\"If the charters truly do say their purpose is the Reconquista, and the Reconquista ends...\" He smiled slightly. \"Then either they dissolve, or they need new charters. New charters that you could help write, with the Pope's approval.\"\n\n\nShould he retrieve these documents for detailed examination?"

This is very astute strategic thinking.\n\nÁlvaro would be excited by this. This is exactly the kind of legal/political maneuvering he excels at. He would:\n1. Agree to retrieve the documents immediately\n2. Explain the enormous strategic value of controlling the Orders\n3. Possibly discuss the practical implications - what this would mean in terms of troops, land, wealth\n4. Outline the political challenge of actually doing it\n5. Suggest how to approach this carefully\n\nThe Orders control massive amounts of territory and military power. Juan is right that bringing them under crown control would fundamentally transform the balance of power in Castile.\n\nI should keep this relatively concise since we're in an active conversation about planning, and wait for Juan's next response.\n\n\nÁlvaro's expression transformed into something between excitement and fierce calculation. \"Your Majesty understands exactly what's at stake.\"\n\n\nHe stood and walked to the door, calling for a clerk. A young man appeared almost instantly. \"Send riders immediately to the archival scribes at Toledo Cathedral, the royal library at Alcázar, and to the chapter houses of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara. I want complete copies of the founding papal bulls and charters for all three Orders. Original Latin, plus any Castilian translations. Mark them as urgent royal business—His Majesty requires them within five days.\"\n\n\nThe clerk bowed and hurried off. Álvaro returned to his seat, energy practically radiating from him.\n\n\n\"Let me give Your Majesty the numbers, because they're staggering.\"\n\n\nHe began counting on his fingers. \"The Order of Santiago alone: Perhaps 400 knight brothers, plus maybe 1,500 to 2,000 sergeants and men-at-arms. Estates across León, Extremadura, New Castile. Perhaps one-tenth of the kingdom's territory. Master Don Rodrigo currently commands them—your appointment.\"\n\n\n\"Calatrava: Maybe 200 knights, another 800 to 1,000 soldiers. Strong in La Mancha and along the Granadan frontier. Master Don Pedro—again, your man.\"\n\n\n\"Alcántara: Similar to Calatrava—150 to 200 knights, perhaps 600 to 800 soldiers. Concentrated in western Extremadura near the Portuguese border.\"\n\n\nHe leaned forward intently. \"Combined, Your Majesty, we're talking about perhaps 700 to 800 knight brothers and 3,000 to 4,000 military personnel they can field. Plus the estates generating revenue to support them—millions of maravedís yearly. Plus the fortresses they control throughout the kingdom.\"\n\n\n\"Right now, those forces serve the crusade because you appointed loyal Masters and because fighting Granada is literally their charter purpose. But after Granada falls?\" He spread his hands. \"They become independent military powers again unless we act.\"\n\n\nHis voice dropped, became more intense. \"But if you can bring them under permanent crown control—if those charters give us legal grounds to argue their purpose is complete and they need reformation under royal authority—Your Majesty would control the largest standing military force in Iberia. Not dependent on feudal levies. Not temporary crusader volunteers. Permanent professional troops with their own funding from their own estates.\"\n\n\n\"The French kings would kill for that. The Emperor Sigismund would weep with envy.\"\n\n\nHe smiled grimly. \"This is why we need to examine those charters very carefully. If there's legal grounds—if their purpose truly ends with the Reconquista's completion—then we can argue to the Pope that they either dissolve or transform into something new. Something under crown authority.\"\n\n\n\"And Your Majesty appointed the current Masters. They're loyal to you. They might actually support this transformation if we frame it right. 'Your purpose is complete. You've won. Now serve the crown directly in the eternal crusade.' Make it about honor and continued purpose rather than dissolution.\"\n\n\nHe met your eyes. \"Five days until those documents arrive. Then we'll know what legal grounds we have.

Let me look at what Álvaro listed earlier:\n\n1. Royal Household: 8 million maravedís (30,000 florins) - 30% of expenses\n2. Non-Crusade Military: 7 million maravedís (26,400 florins) - 26% of expenses\n3. Administration and Governance: 4.7 million maravedís (17,700 florins) - 18% of expenses\n4. Debt Service: 3 million maravedís (11,300 florins) - 11% of expenses\n5. Miscellaneous and Contingency: 4 million maravedís (15,000 florins) - 15% of expenses\n\nTotal: 26.7 million maravedís (100,800 florins)\n\nThe user is noting they're building a central bureaucracy through the crusade tax collection system. Can they use this to reduce costs or increase efficiency? This is a great strategic question.\n\nAreas for optimization:\n1. Administration - better trained bureaucrats might actually reduce corruption in alcabala collection (currently losing 2 million)\n2. Military - if they control the Orders, they might reduce redundant garrison costs\n3. Miscellaneous - this \"always grows when you're not watching\" category is ripe for reform\n4. Debt service - could be reduced by paying down debt with conquest proceeds\n\nThe crusade bureaucracy being built (assessors, collectors, oversight) could be repurposed for peacetime tax collection, reducing corruption and improving efficiency.\n\n\nÁlvaro pulled the expense documents back in front of him, studying them with fresh eyes. \"Optimization. Yes, Your Majesty, there's definitely room for improvement.\"\n\n\nHe tapped the first category. \"Royal Household—8 million maravedís. This one is... politically sensitive. Could we reduce it? Certainly. French kings spend more, but that doesn't mean we need to match them. However, cutting royal household expenses sends a message. It can look like weakness, or like austerity that breeds grumbling among courtiers. Not where I'd start.\"\n\n\nHe moved down. \"Administration—4.7 million maravedís. Here's where your observation about the bureaucracy becomes very interesting.\" He leaned forward. \"We're currently training officials for the crusade tax system. Professional assessors, collectors, record-keepers. They're learning standardized procedures, proper accounting, oversight mechanisms.\"\n\n\n\"Once Granada falls, we don't dismiss them. We redirect them. Use them to collect the alcabala more efficiently—we're currently losing 2 million maravedís yearly to corruption in sales tax collection. That's nearly half the administration budget just... vanishing. Professional, well-supervised tax collectors following crusade-standard procedures could cut that loss in half or more.\"\n\n\nHe did quick mental arithmetic. \"Recovering even 1 million maravedís from corruption would nearly pay for the entire administration budget. The bureaucracy pays for itself.\"\n\n\n\"We could also use these trained officials to audit crown estates more carefully. Your Majesty, the royal domain produces 9.2 million maravedís yearly, but I'd wager we're losing another 10-15% to inefficiency and theft by local administrators. Better oversight could add another million.\"\n\n\nHe moved to the next item. \"Military—7 million maravedís. This is harder to cut without weakening defenses. However...\" He paused thoughtfully. \"If we bring the Military Orders under crown control, we might actually reduce this. Here's why: we're currently maintaining separate royal garrisons at fortresses near Order-controlled territory. There's redundancy. If the Orders are under crown command, we could consolidate. Reduce duplicate positions. Their forces become part of the overall defensive structure rather than separate entities we have to work around.\"\n\n\n\"Not huge savings—maybe 500,000 to 1 million maravedís—but meaningful.\"\n\n\n\"Debt Service—3 million maravedís.\" He tapped this firmly. \"We can't negotiate this down while we owe the money, but we can eliminate it faster. You've conquered territory generating booty. Use some of those proceeds to pay down the principal aggressively. Every million we pay off saves us the interest—perhaps 15-20% yearly. Pay off the full 15 million in debt, and that's 3 million maravedís permanently freed up.\"\n\n\n\"Miscellaneous—4 million maravedís. This category,\" he said with some distaste, \"is where money goes to die. 'Everything else'—which means poorly tracked expenses that accumulate. Gifts that aren't really necessary. Repairs that get inflated. Charitable obligations that have become habits rather than genuine needs.\"\n\n\n\"With better bureaucracy, better accounting, better oversight—the kind we're building for the crusade—we could cut this by a third easily. Maybe half. That's 1.5 to 2 million maravedís saved.\"\n\n\nHe sat back, calculating. \"So, realistic optimizations using the bureaucracy we're building:\n\n\nRecover lost alcabala revenue: +1 to 1.5 million maravedís\nBetter crown estate management: +1 million maravedís\nConsolidate military with Orders under control: -500,000 to 1 million maravedís in redundant costs\nPay down debt aggressively: -3 million maravedís once debt eliminated (2-3 years)\nCut miscellaneous waste: -1.5 to 2 million maravedís\n\n\nTotal potential savings/recovery: 7 to 9 million maravedís—26,000 to 34,000 florins.\"\n\n\nHe met your eyes. \"Combined with the revenue increases from tax reform and Granada... Your Majesty, we could transform the crown's finances within five years. From 106,000 florins revenue and barely breaking even, to perhaps 150,000 florins revenue with 15-20% annual surplus after eliminating debt and waste.\"\n\n\n\"The key is using the crusade emergency to build permanent administrative capacity. Every trained official, every standardized procedure, every oversight mechanism we create now becomes part of the kingdom's permanent structure. We're not just conquering Granada—we're building a modern state.\"\n\n\nHe smiled slightly. \"Tommaso Parentucelli would approve. This is how the Italian city-states became so wealthy—professional administration, careful accounting, eliminating waste. We're learning from them.\"\n\n\nDoes this vision of optimization align with your thinking?"

Juan is thinking about creating a systematic enforcement structure for crown authority. This is quite sophisticated thinking for medieval governance.\n\nLet me think about what Álvaro would say:\n\n1. This is exactly the kind of administrative structure that strengthens royal power\n2. It creates clear escalation procedures\n3. It provides intermediaries between \"refused entry\" and \"send the army\"\n4. It makes resistance costly and predictable\n5. It's similar to systems developing in France and other centralizing monarchies\n\nThe concept of \"Crown Marshals\" is historically plausible - similar to French bailiffs or English sheriffs with expanded powers. Álvaro would likely be enthusiastic about this.\n\nKey elements to discuss:\n- The escalation structure (assessor refused → marshal sent → army if still refused)\n- Legal authority and backing (crusade powers, papal support)\n- Consequences at each stage (fines, then forfeiture, then military action)\n- How this becomes permanent vs just crusade-era\n- Number of marshals needed\n- Their powers and limitations\n- Making it public and known\n\nÁlvaro would see this as brilliant because:\n- It's systematic rather than ad hoc\n- It gives people chances to comply before total destruction\n- But it makes the consequences absolutely clear\n- It builds permanent enforcement infrastructure\n- It protects crown officials from violence\n\nHe might suggest refinements or considerations about implementation.\n\n\nÁlvaro's eyes widened, and then a broad smile spread across his face. \"Your Majesty, this is exactly the kind of institutional thinking that builds lasting royal power.\"\n\n\nHe immediately grabbed parchment and began sketching out the structure as he spoke. \"What you're describing is a formal escalation procedure with clear consequences at each stage. It protects crown officials, makes resistance predictable and costly, and gives nobles chances to comply before facing total destruction. Brilliant.\"\n\n\nHe began outlining: \"Stage One: Initial Refusal. Crown assessor or official is denied entry, threatened, or obstructed. The assessor documents everything—who refused, what was said, witnesses if possible. Reports immediately to the nearest Crown Marshal.\"\n\n\n\"Stage Two: Marshal Intervention. The Crown Marshal—we'll define their powers in a moment—arrives with perhaps 20 to 50 armed men. Not an army, but enough to make the point. The Marshal presents formal charges: obstruction of crown business. Offers one final chance to comply. Assesses a fine for the initial refusal—say, double what they owed, plus costs of the Marshal's visit.\"\n\n\n\"Stage Three: Petition for Military Action. If the noble still refuses, threatens the Marshal, or continues obstruction, the Marshal formally petitions Your Majesty or your regent for military escalation. This petition becomes part of the official record. At this point, the noble has had two chances. When you send the army, everyone knows they were given opportunity to comply.\"\n\n\n\"Stage Four: Military Enforcement and Forfeiture. Army arrives. Noble is declared in rebellion, excommunicated if they haven't been already, lands declared forfeit. Complete and public. Everyone sees: resist once, pay a fine. Resist twice, lose everything.\"\n\n\nHe looked up from his notes. \"The beauty of this system is that it's systematic. Not the king's personal anger, not arbitrary—it's procedure. Everyone knows the steps. Everyone knows the consequences. It becomes predictable, which is what law is supposed to be.\"\n\n\nHe set down the quill. \"Now, these Crown Marshals. Let's define them properly.\"\n\n\n\"Authority: They should hold royal warrants directly from Your Majesty, updated annually. They speak with your voice on matters of taxation and crown business. Nobles know that refusing a Marshal is refusing you.\"\n\n\n\"Powers:\n\n\nRight of entry to any estate for crown business (tax assessment, investigation of obstruction, enforcement)\n\nAuthority to levy fines up to a certain amount—say, 10,000 maravedís—without further approval\n\nPower to arrest individuals who threaten or assault crown officials\n\nRight to commandeer local troops if needed (from loyal nearby nobles or city militias)\n\nFormal petition process to request military intervention from the crown\"\n\n\n\"Limitations:\n\n\nCannot seize estates without royal approval\n\nCannot impose punishments beyond fines and arrest without trial\n\nMust document everything thoroughly—reports to you or your regent monthly\n\nSubject to oversight—perhaps by Cardinal Capranica during the crusade, then by the Royal Council afterwards\"\n\n\n\"Number needed: For Castile? Perhaps eight to twelve Marshals. We could divide the kingdom into districts—each Marshal responsible for a region. León, Galicia, Old Castile, Extremadura, Andalusia divided into sections. They're based in major cities with quick access to surrounding estates.\"\n\n\n\"Selection criteria: These need to be men of substance—not great lords who have their own agendas, but lesser nobility or professional administrators with military experience. Men loyal to the crown, competent, intimidating enough to be taken seriously. Former military officers who understand both command and administration. Men like Captain Fernán, but with more legal training.\"\n\n\nHe leaned forward eagerly. \"Now here's what makes this truly powerful: public proclamation. At the Cortes, after you announce the excommunications of the three who threatened assessors, you announce the creation of the Crown Marshal system. You read out the procedure clearly:\n\n\n'From this day forward, any noble who refuses, obstructs, or threatens crown officials conducting lawful business shall face the following: First, a Crown Marshal with armed escort will demand compliance and levy fines. Second, if obstruction continues, petition for military intervention. Third, forfeiture of lands and titles. This procedure is established so that no one can claim ignorance. Compliance is simple. Resistance is rebellion.'\"\n\n\n\"Make it a formal law. Have it written down. Send copies to every major estate. Post it in every city. Everyone knows the procedure. No surprises.\"\n\n\nHis voice became intense. \"This does several things simultaneously. First: It protects your officials. They're not alone anymore. They know a Marshal will back them up. Second: It makes resistance calculable. Nobles know exactly what will happen. Some might pay the fine rather than lose everything. Third: It creates permanent enforcement infrastructure. These Marshals don't disappear when the crusade ends—they become permanent royal officials. Fourth: It establishes precedent that royal authority is real, backed by force, and systematic.\"\n\n\nHe paused, then added: \"We'd need to be careful about a few things. The Marshals need to be scrupulously fair—if they're corrupt or abuse power, the system loses legitimacy. They need clear guidelines about when to escalate versus when to negotiate. And we need to ensure they're actually intimidating enough that nobles take them seriously but not so aggressive that they provoke resistance unnecessarily.\"\n\n\n\"Also,\" he said thoughtfully, \"we should probably run this through Cardinal Capranica. Frame it as necessary for enforcing the crusade tax. Get his explicit approval. That way, it has both royal and papal backing. Much harder to resist.\"\n\n\nHe met your eyes. \"We could have the first Marshals appointed within two weeks. Train them in their duties. Have them in place by the time the Cortes ends. So when you announce the excommunications and the new tax law, you also announce: 'And here are the eight Crown Marshals who will enforce these laws.' Immediate, visible, real.\"\n\n\nHe smiled. \"The Count of Niebla threatened an assessor with clubs. Imagine a Crown Marshal arriving at his gates with fifty soldiers and a royal warrant. 'Your Excellency, you have obstructed crown business. You owe double the original assessment plus 3,000 maravedís for this visit. You have three days to pay. Or we proceed to the next stage.' That's power.\"\n\n\n\"And then, when we send the army to Niebla after he refuses the Marshal too... everyone will know he had every chance. The system worked. He chose rebellion. No sympathy from other nobles.\"\n\n\nWhat refinements or concerns does Your Majesty have about this system?"

Juan is being very practical about the timeline - recognizing that they can't train a full complement of Marshals before the Cortes, but they can establish the institution by presenting three initial appointments with proper ceremony. This is smart politically - it makes the system real and visible immediately, while allowing for expansion later.\n\nThe three tasks he's outlined are clear and actionable:\n1. Find three candidates immediately\n2. Get Capranica's approval \n3. Draft the formal law\n\nI should have Álvaro respond enthusiastically to this practical approach, suggest who the three initial Marshals might be, discuss what the \"icons of their office\" should be (staff? badge? warrant?), and confirm the timeline for getting this done before the Cortes.\n\nThis is a great example of institution-building in real time. Juan is creating permanent royal power structures using the crusade emergency as cover.\n\n\nÁlvaro nodded emphatically. \"Your Majesty is absolutely right. Better to launch with three fully prepared Marshals than scramble to find twelve mediocre ones. Three is enough to establish the institution, demonstrate the concept, and expand from there.\"\n\n\nHe began making notes rapidly. \"Timeline: The Cortes convenes November 15th. That gives us about two weeks. Tight, but manageable if we move immediately.\"\n\n\n\"Task One: Three Candidates. Let me propose some names right now, men who could fill this role:\n\n\nFirst: Don Íñigo López de Orozco. Minor nobility from Guadalajara. Former military commander, now in his early forties. Experienced, literate, intimidating presence. Completely loyal—his family has no ties to the great houses that might create conflicts. Currently serving as corregidor in Cuenca, so he has administrative experience.\n\n\nSecond: García Fernández de Villalobos. Lesser knight from León. Distinguished himself in frontier service against Granada in past years. Smart, methodical, respected by soldiers. No great estate or faction to serve—depends entirely on royal favor.\n\n\nThird: Pedro Álvarez de Osorio. From minor Galician nobility. Served as military judge, so he understands law and procedure. Tough, fair reputation. Also unconnected to major noble houses.\"\n\n\nHe looked up. \"Three different regions—Guadalajara for New Castile, León for the north, Galicia for the northwest. Shows the system covers the kingdom. All experienced in both military and administrative matters. All men who owe their position to the crown, not to family connections.\"\n\n\n\"I can have messengers riding within the hour. Summon all three to Toledo immediately. Tell them it's urgent royal business. They can be here in five to seven days—just enough time to brief them on their duties before the Cortes.\"\n\n\nHe moved to the second task. \"Cardinal Capranica: I'll request an audience for you tomorrow. Present the concept: formal enforcement mechanism for the crusade tax, systematic procedure to prevent obstruction. Frame it as strengthening the tax collection system he helped design. Emphasize the fairness—multiple chances to comply, clear procedures, not arbitrary royal anger.\"\n\n\n\"He'll appreciate the systematic approach. Very Italian—they love formal procedures and clear hierarchies. And he wants the crusade tax to work, so giving it teeth should appeal to him.\"\n\n\n\"The Law:\" Álvaro pulled fresh parchment forward. \"Let me draft the outline now, you can review and refine. Something like this:\n\n\n\nRoyal Decree Establishing Crown Marshals for Enforcement of Crusade Obligations and Royal Authority\n\n\nWhereas His Majesty King Juan II, by authority of the papal bull Inter Cetera Divinae, has established taxation for the holy crusade against Granada;\n\n\nWhereas certain nobles have obstructed, threatened, and refused lawful crown officials in performance of their sacred duties;\n\n\nWhereas such obstruction constitutes rebellion against both royal and papal authority;\n\n\nTherefore, His Majesty establishes the Office of Crown Marshal with the following authorities and procedures:\n\n\nArticle I: Authority and Appointment\nCrown Marshals hold royal warrants directly from His Majesty. They speak with the King's voice on matters of taxation, assessment, and enforcement of royal decrees. Appointment requires royal signature and seal, renewable annually.\n\n\nArticle II: Jurisdiction\nEach Marshal has jurisdiction over assigned districts. They may enter any estate within their district on crown business, supported by armed escort as needed.\n\n\nArticle III: Enforcement Procedure\n\n\nStage One: Upon report of obstruction or refusal by crown official, the Marshal shall proceed to the estate with armed escort (not exceeding 100 men). The Marshal shall present formal charges and demand immediate compliance. Fine for initial obstruction: double the original obligation plus costs of Marshal's visit (minimum 2,000 maravedís).\n\n\nStage Two: Should the noble refuse the Marshal, threaten violence, or continue obstruction, the Marshal shall petition His Majesty or designated regent for military intervention. This petition shall be documented and entered into royal records.\n\n\nStage Three: Upon approval of military action, His Majesty shall dispatch royal forces to compel compliance. The noble shall be declared in rebellion, subject to excommunication by Church authority, and forfeiture of lands and titles to the crown.\n\n\nArticle IV: Powers of Crown Marshals\n\n\nRight of entry to estates for crown business\n\nAuthority to levy fines up to 10,000 maravedís\n\nPower to arrest individuals who assault or threaten crown officials\n\nRight to commandeer local troops from loyal nobles or city militias\n\nFormal petition process for military escalation\n\n\nArticle V: Limitations and Oversight\n\n\nCannot seize estates without royal approval\n\nCannot execute or impose capital punishment without trial\n\nMust provide monthly written reports to His Majesty or designated regent\n\nSubject to oversight by royal council and papal legate during crusade\n\nFalse charges or abuse of authority punishable by removal and fine\n\n\nArticle VI: Symbols of Office\nEach Marshal shall carry:\n\n\nRoyal warrant bearing His Majesty's seal\n\nMarshal's staff of office (black wood with crown emblem)\n\nBadge of authority worn visibly\n\n\nArticle VII: Public Notice\nThis decree shall be read publicly in all major cities and posted at all noble estates. Ignorance of these procedures shall not excuse obstruction.\n\n\n\nHe set down the quill. \"Something like that. We can refine the language, but the structure establishes the office, defines clear procedures, shows multiple chances for compliance, and makes consequences explicit.\"\n\n\n\"Symbols of Office:\" He looked up thoughtfully. \"They need something visible, impressive, unmistakable. I suggest:\n\n\nMarshal's Staff: Black oak, about five feet tall, topped with a gilded crown. Heavy enough to be imposing, distinctive enough that anyone seeing it knows exactly who carries it.\n\nRoyal Warrant: Sealed parchment bearing your signature, seal, and the full text of their authority. Encased in a leather tube they can present at gates.\n\nBadge of Office: Gold or silver badge worn on a chain—perhaps a crown with crossed keys beneath it, symbolizing royal authority and access. Visible at a distance, marks them as your representatives.\"\n\n\nHe met your eyes. \"At the Cortes, after you present the tax law and announce the excommunications, you call forward these three men. Present them with their staffs, warrants, and badges in front of the entire assembly. 'Behold the Crown Marshals, established to enforce crown authority and protect crown officials. The procedure is written. The consequences are clear. Compliance brings prosperity. Obstruction brings ruin.'\"\n\n\n\"Ceremony matters. Make it memorable. Make it real.\"\n\n\nHe paused, then added: \"And Your Majesty, we should pay them well. Perhaps 300 to 400 maravedís monthly—enough that it's a prestigious position, enough that they're not tempted by bribes. These men represent you. They need to be above reproach.\"\n\n\n\"So, immediate actions:\n\n\nI draft formal messengers today summoning the three candidates\n\nI request Capranica audience for tomorrow\n\nI write the formal law tonight—you review tomorrow\n\nWe commission the symbols of office—staffs can be made in a week, badges in a few days\n\nCandidates arrive, we brief them thoroughly\n\nPresent them at Cortes with full ceremony\"\n\n\nHe smiled. \"Two weeks. Tight, but absolutely doable. And we establish an institution that will serve the crown for decades.\"\n\n\nDoes this plan satisfy Your Majesty's vision?"

Lets put the fine for getting the marshall involved at 50% of the normal tax. And make sure that the marshall is not getting paid by the offender. This creates seperation of powers between the tax assessor and the marshall. The marshall never confiscates goods or demands payment himself, he empowers the assessor to do so. The marshall has the power to levy fines (up to 10.000 maravedis) but these are paid to the assessor. \nEliminate monthly reports, this is not realistic.

The proportional fine—50% of the original obligation—scales appropriately whether dealing with a minor knight owing 500 maravedís or a great duke owing 30,000. Much more practical.\"\n\n\nHe tapped the section on separation of powers. \"And this is crucial. The Marshal never touches money. He's pure enforcement—he empowers the assessor to collect, but the assessor handles all finances. Prevents corruption, prevents the appearance of the Marshal profiting from fines. Clean separation.\"\n\n\nHe looked up. \"No monthly reports, no annual renewals. These are permanent royal appointments. Much more realistic for men who may need to travel for weeks through their districts. They document their actions, but they're not drowning in bureaucracy.\"\n\n\nHe gestured to the document. \"Read it through, Your Majesty. If it meets your approval, we can have copies made tonight.

They should arrive in Toledo within a week—plenty of time to brief them before the Cortes. And I'll request the Capranica audience for tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\nHe smiled slightly. \"Two weeks from now, Your Majesty will present this law, announce three excommunications, unveil the eternal crusade vision, and introduce the first Crown Marshals.

So she's about 7-8 months pregnant now.\n\nFrom the character tracker and previous chapters, Isabel:\n- Is conventionally pious, prays regularly\n- Has a Portuguese chapel in their chambers\n- Is not politically minded\n- Has been very worried about Juan during campaigns\n- Has been managing court life while Juan was away\n- Has Portuguese ladies-in-waiting (Dona Beatriz, Dona Leonor)\n- Is experiencing late pregnancy\n\nSince it's evening after vespers, and Isabel is very pious, she might be:\n- In evening prayers\n- Resting (pregnancy is tiring, especially late pregnancy)\n- With her ladies-in-waiting\n- In their chambers\n\nI should describe the scene warmly but realistically - she's heavily pregnant, likely tired, probably praying or resting.

She notices you first and rises with a curtsy, gathering her things. \"Your Majesty,\" she murmurs, and slips out to give you privacy.\n\n\nIsabel turns at the sound of movement, one hand steadying herself as she shifts her weight. Seven months pregnant now, perhaps eight—the physicians said January or early February. Her face shows the fatigue of late pregnancy, but her expression softens when she sees you.\n\n\n\"Juan.\" She makes to stand, but it's clearly an effort. \"I didn't hear you come in. I was just finishing evening prayers.\"\n\n\nThe chamber is warm, comfortable. Servants have lit braziers against the October chill. A light meal sits on a side table—bread, cheese, fruit—barely touched.

They lose everything for their rebellion, but they have a path back through genuine service to God and the crusade. Not easy—they'll have to humble themselves, serve alongside men they might have once commanded, prove their loyalty through blood and sacrifice. But the door is open.\"\n\n\nShe pauses, thinking. \"And lands in Granada afterward... they start fresh, in territory won through their own sweat and prayers. That's actually quite elegant. They can't go back to their old estates and old ways. They have to build something new under your authority.\"\n\n\nBut then her brow furrows slightly at your second statement. \"Wait—you're thinking of making Infante Juan the Duke of Granada? One of the Infantes de Aragón?\"\n\n\nShe looks at you carefully, not quite alarmed but clearly processing. \"Juan, he rebelled against you. Yes, he's serving loyally now in the western campaign with Rodrigo Manrique, and I know he's trying to redeem himself. But... Duke of Granada? That's not just lands, that's one of the most important positions in the kingdom after the conquest. Controlling the entire conquered emirate?\"\n\n\nShe shifts on the bench, one hand on her belly. \"I'm not saying it's wrong—I'm just... surprised. Is he ready for that? Can you trust him with that much power? Or is this...\" She pauses, thinking. \"Is this about keeping him busy and contained? Giving him something so large that he can't cause trouble elsewhere? Using ambition to bind loyalty?\"\n\n\nHer expression is thoughtful, not critical. \"Tell me your thinking. Because either this is brilliant strategy I'm not seeing yet, or...\" She doesn't finish, but her concern is gentle, wifely. She trusts your judgment but wants to understand."

What he's taken from the Infante (lands, claims to Aragon)\n2. Whether a dukedom balances that loss\n3. Whether it's too much power to give someone who rebelled\n4. Alternative of just giving him knighthood and estate\n5. Keeping the Duke of Granada title for himself for now\n\nIsabel should respond to this thoughtfulness. She should:\n- Appreciate his consideration of different options\n- Maybe provide gentle wisdom about trust and power\n- Support the idea of waiting to see how Juan proves himself\n- Perhaps suggest that holding the title himself gives flexibility\n- Be wifely and supportive while also being honest\n\nThis is a good intimate conversation between husband and wife about governance.\n\n\nIsabel nods slowly, her expression thoughtful. \"That makes more sense. Taking the dukedom yourself—at least for now—gives you time to see how things unfold. How he proves himself.\"\n\n\nShe squeezes your hand gently. \"Juan, you're being wise about this. Yes, you've taken much from him—his lands, his potential claim to Aragon. That was necessary because he rebelled. But you've also given him something precious: a chance to redeem himself. To serve with honor. To rebuild his name through the crusade.\"\n\n\nShe shifts slightly, getting more comfortable. \"A knight's estate in Granada is generous. It's meaningful. It shows mercy without being reckless. If he serves loyally for years, proves himself completely trustworthy, earns back respect—then maybe later you consider more. Maybe he becomes Count of something. Maybe eventually, if he truly transforms, something greater.\"\n\n\nHer hand moves to her belly again—a habitual gesture now. \"But you don't have to decide everything right now. You can hold the title of Duke of Granada yourself. Maybe give it to...\" She pauses, a small smile appearing. \"Maybe give it to your son or daughter someday. Our child. Let them grow up knowing they'll have Granada to govern when they're ready.\"\n\n\nShe looks at you directly. \"You stripped the Infantes of their claims and lands because they were dangerous—because keeping them powerful meant keeping the kingdom fractured and weak. That was the right choice. Now you're being merciful in giving them paths back. But mercy doesn't mean restoring them to exactly where they were. That would just recreate the same problems.\"\n\n\nShe leans her head on your shoulder. \"You're balancing justice and mercy, Juan. That's what good kings do. And what good Christians do. You don't have to rush to give away Granada's most important titles. Wait. Watch. See who truly earns them through faithful service.\"\n\n\nA pause, then quieter: \"Besides, keeping important titles in your own hands—at least for now—that's just practical governance. You've worked too hard building royal authority to immediately hand chunks of it away.\"\n\n\nShe looks up at you. \"Does that help? Or am I overstepping?\""

Isabel would respond to this with genuine emotion - it speaks to her faith deeply. She would be moved by his vision of a kingdom built on Christian principles, family, love, and service to God. This aligns with everything she values.\n\nI should have her respond emotionally but also authentically - she's pregnant, emotional, and this kind of talk about legacy and raising the world higher for the next generation would hit especially hard right now as she's about to bring a child into this world.\n\nThe \"Non Nobis Domine\" reference at the end - that's his father's sword inscription, \"Not unto us, O Lord\" - would particularly move her because it shows he's not seeking glory for himself but for God.\n\nThis is an intimate, vulnerable moment between them. Isabel should respond with love, faith, and perhaps some tears because she's emotional from pregnancy and from hearing her husband articulate such a beautiful vision.\n\n\nIsabel goes very still against you.

Where love itself is an act of worship.\"\n\n\nShe's crying openly now, but smiling through it. \"This child,\" she says, placing both your hands on her belly, \"will have a father who understands what kingship truly means. Not glory. Not power. Service. Raising the world higher for the next generation.\"\n\n\nThe baby kicks strongly under your joined hands.\n\n\n\"They're going to grow up hearing those words,\" Isabel says softly. \"Non Nobis Domine. Not unto us, but to His glory. Just like you heard them from your father.

Pedro Álvarez de Osorio - from Galicia, served as military judge\n\nI should not write Juan's dialogue or questions - just set up the scene and have the candidates present, then stop for Juan to interact with them.\n\n\nThe next days pass in focused preparation.\n\n\nThe morning after your evening with Isabel, you meet Cardinal Capranica after Mass. Álvaro presents the Crown Marshal concept, emphasizing the systematic enforcement of crusade taxation and protection of papal authority. The Cardinal listens carefully, asks pointed questions about oversight and proportionality, then nods his approval. \"A well-structured system. The Church has long employed similar mechanisms in the Papal States. Systematic justice is preferable to arbitrary power.\" He agrees to witness the decree alongside the Archbishop.\n\n\nMessengers ride out that same day, carrying urgent summons to the three candidates.

A fire burns in the hearth against the autumn chill. Álvaro has briefed them on the basics but deliberately left detailed explanation for you.\n\n\nDon Íñigo López de Orozco stands perhaps forty-five years old, weathered face, intelligent eyes. He wears practical traveling clothes, carries himself like a man accustomed to both military command and administrative precision. His bow is correct, neither servile nor presumptuous.\n\n\nGarcía Fernández de Villalobos is younger—maybe thirty-five—lean and hard from frontier service. Scarred hands, watchful posture. He looks like a man who's seen real fighting and survived through competence rather than luck.\n\n\nPedro Álvarez de Osorio appears to be in his early forties, with the bearing of someone comfortable in both courtrooms and military camps. Galician accent evident when he speaks his greeting. Something measured and fair in his expression.\n\n\nAll three stand before you, awaiting your words. They know they've been summoned for important royal business, but Álvaro deliberately kept the specifics vague. They're curious, alert, trying to read the situation.\n\n\nÁlvaro stands to the side, ready to clarify or provide details as needed, but clearly deferring to you.\n\n\nThe three candidates wait for you to speak.\n\n\nWhat do you say to them?"

Unfortunately, some take advantage of our good christian habits. This year, some of my tax assessors that have been collecting the crusade tax have been threatened and in some cases even beaten up. A situation I deem unacceptable. Not only are they lacking clear christian values, it dishonours every faithfull christian that is contributing his fair share to the crusade. And I cannot stand injustice. That is where need you.\n\n\nMy tax assessors have to be able to do their work without the threat to their person, and they must have full access to a lord's estate and books.

You will be accompanied by a body of men to explain in more explicit terms what will happen if nobles are not cooperating. I trust you to wield these powers with wisdom, restraint and mercy. Give everyone a good second chance to comply. Listen to their concerns and use your own instinct and judgement. If the gates of a keep remains closed to even you, it is not your job to lay siege or to attack. You report these matters to me or to my regent who will make sure these nobles are excommunicated and an army sent to strip them of their lands and titles.

If this position means protecting men doing their lawful duty, ensuring nobles can't simply refuse crown authority because they have more swords...\"\n\n\nHis scarred hands flex slightly. \"I've spent my life fighting Moors, Your Majesty. But injustice from our own people? That wounds the kingdom worse than any enemy. If you're offering me the chance to fight that...\" He meets your eyes directly. \"I accept, Your Majesty. Gladly.\"\n\n\nPedro Álvarez de Osorio speaks last, his Galician accent more pronounced as emotion enters his voice. \"Your Majesty, as military judge I saw cases where the law was clear but enforcement impossible. A lesser knight wronged by a great lord has no recourse—who will enforce judgment when the guilty party commands two hundred men and stone walls? The law becomes words on parchment, meaningless.\"\n\n\nHe steps forward slightly. \"What you're describing—systematic enforcement, clear procedures, consequences that actually happen—that's how law becomes real. Not suggestions nobles can ignore. Actual justice that applies to everyone.\"\n\n\nHis expression shows something like hope. \"I've spent years watching injustice I couldn't fix because I lacked authority to enforce my judgments. If you're giving me—giving us—that authority, backed by your crown and your army...\" He bows deeply. \"Your Majesty, I accept.

A statement, tinged with resignation and worry.\n\n\nDona Beatriz quietly gathers her things and slips out.\n\n\nIsabel struggles to sit up straighter, breathing slightly labored from the baby's weight pressing on her lungs. \"The Cortes. Of course. November 15th.\" She tries to keep her voice steady. \"How long will you be gone?\"\n\n\nHer hand moves protectively to her belly—a gesture that's become constant now. The baby is due in two months, perhaps less."

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed Isabel's anxieties against Juan's necessary brief absence.\n\nJuan is leaving for the Cortes, which is being held somewhere else - not in Toledo. I need to check where the Cortes is being held. Looking back at the project files, I see references to the Cortes being summoned for November 15, 1431, but I don't see a specific location mentioned in what I've read.\n\nActually, wait - in medieval Castile, the Cortes could be held in different cities. Major cities where Cortes were held included Valladolid, Burgos, Toledo, etc. Since Juan is currently in Toledo and is saying he needs to travel and will be back in 8-10 days, it seems the Cortes is NOT being held in Toledo.\n\nI should have Isabel respond to this - she's heavily pregnant (7-8 months, due in January/early February), it's now early/mid November. Juan is saying he'll be gone 8-10 days total. That would be relatively quick - a few days travel there, a few days for the Cortes, a few days back.\n\nIsabel would be worried but also trying to be strong. She knows he has to do this. But she's also very pregnant and frightened of giving birth without him, and he's promised to be there for the birth. This is different though - this is just the Cortes, not a military campaign. Much shorter, much safer.\n\nShe'd probably accept this, but with some anxiety. She trusts him to come back, but pregnancy makes women anxious, and she's been through months of worry during the campaign season.\n\n\nIsabel clutches your hand tightly, her other hand still on her belly. She closes her eyes briefly, breathing slowly—whether from the physical discomfort of late pregnancy or the effort to steady her emotions, it's hard to tell.\n\n\n\"Eight to ten days,\" she repeats. \"That's... that's not long. That's nothing compared to when you were at Málaga for two months.\" She opens her eyes, looking at you. \"I can manage that. Of course I can.\"\n\n\nBut her grip on your hand doesn't loosen. \"It's just—the Cortes. You're going to excommunicate those three nobles, present the new tax law, introduce the Crown Marshals. There will be angry nobles. Shouting. Maybe worse.\"\n\n\nShe touches your face with her free hand. \"Promise me you'll be careful. I know it's not a battlefield, but court politics can be dangerous too. Men with wounded pride and empty purses... Don Álvaro will be with you?\"\n\n\nA pause, then she manages a small smile. \"Eight to ten days. I'll barely have time to miss you.\" It's a brave attempt at lightness, but her eyes betray the worry. \"And you'll be back before... well, before anything happens with the baby. That's still two months away. The physicians are certain.\"\n\n\nShe pulls you closer, wrapping her arms around you as much as her belly allows. \"Go. Do what you must. Reshape Castile. Build your kingdom of justice. I'll be here praying for you, waiting for you.\"\n\n\nHer voice drops to a whisper. \"Just come back safely. These ten days, Juan. That's all I ask. Come back safely.\"\n\n\nShe holds you for a long moment, then pulls back. \"When do you leave?\""

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated departure narrative, journey, and arrival at Cortes.\n\nJuan is leaving for the Cortes. He's kissing Isabel goodbye and setting off. I should narrate this departure, the journey, and his arrival at the Cortes location.\n\nThe Cortes would likely be held in a significant city. Looking at the project files, previous Cortes have been mentioned, and major cities include Toledo (where they currently are), Valladolid, Burgos, etc. I should check what makes sense.\n\nActually, wait - Juan is in Toledo already. The Cortes is being summoned for November 15, 1431. Where would it convene? Historically, Cortes could meet in various cities. Given that Juan is preparing to leave Toledo \"in an hour or so\", the Cortes must be meeting elsewhere.\n\nCommon locations for Castilian Cortes included Valladolid, Burgos, Madrid (though less important in 1431), Segovia, etc. Let me pick a reasonable location. Valladolid was a major site for Cortes meetings and is a reasonable distance from Toledo - maybe 3-4 days ride.\n\nLet me narrate the farewell, the journey, and arrival at the Cortes location.\n\n\nIsabel nods, trying to keep her composure. \"I'll be right here. Comfortable. Well cared for. Dona Beatriz won't let me lift a finger.\"\n\n\nShe rises carefully as you stand, steadying herself with one hand on the chair. You embrace once more—her swollen belly between you, the baby moving slightly at the pressure. You kiss her—gentle, lingering, meant to carry you both through the separation.\n\n\n\"Go,\" she whispers, touching your face one last time. \"And hurry back to us.\"\n\n\n\nWithin the hour, you're mounted in the Alcázar courtyard. Álvaro sits his horse beside you, along with Captain Fernán, twenty royal guards, and the three newly invested Crown Marshals—they'll accompany you to the Cortes as a show of your new enforcement power.\n\n\nThe staffs of office are strapped to their saddles, the gold badges visible on their chests. Don Íñigo, García, and Pedro look both proud and grimly aware of what's coming.\n\n\nThe ride north begins as afternoon fades toward evening. You'll push hard—covering ground quickly to reach Valladolid where the Cortes has been summoned to convene.\n\n\n\nFour days of hard riding through November countryside. Cold mornings, frost on the ground, breath misting. The landscape is brown and grey—winter approaching. You pass through towns preparing for the cold months, smoke rising from chimneys, harvests long finished.\n\n\nAt night, lodging in monasteries or loyal nobles' estates. Álvaro uses the time to review strategy, going over the exact sequence: tax law first, let them debate, excommunications second, Crown Marshals presentation third, eternal crusade vision last.\n\n\nThe three Marshals ride quietly, observing, learning. They've spent their days in Toledo hearing assessor stories—threats, intimidation, gates slammed in faces. Now they understand viscerally what they're protecting against.\n\n\n\nNovember 14th, Late Afternoon: Valladolid\n\n\nThe city comes into view across the plains—walls, cathedral towers, the royal palace where the Cortes will meet. Noble banners already fly from various quarters—the great houses have arrived, brought their retinues, claimed their lodgings.\n\n\nYour arrival is announced by trumpets. The white-armored king, the Royal Constable, the royal guard, and three men carrying distinctive black staffs with gilded crowns.\n\n\nPeople line the streets to watch. Word has spread that something significant is coming—the successful crusade commander, fresh from victories, summoning Cortes. Speculation runs wild about what you'll announce.\n\n\nYou're given chambers in the royal palace. Álvaro immediately begins coordinating with the various factions—taking the temperature, identifying supporters and likely resisters.\n\n\nThat evening, in your private chambers, Álvaro provides his assessment:\n\n\n\"About sixty nobles present—some great houses, many middling ones, representatives from major cities. The atmosphere is... tense. They know something's coming. The loyal houses—Mendozas, those who've served well in the crusade—they're ready to support you. The ones who've been paying their taxes without complaint are curious but not hostile.\"\n\n\n\"But others...\" He grimaces. \"Representatives from Niebla, Medina, Sotomayor's family. They're here. They know assessors reported them. They're nervous, defensive, gathering allies. Whispering about royal overreach.\"\n\n\n\"Tomorrow the Cortes convenes. Your opening speech sets the tone.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"Ready, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\nThe Cortes opens tomorrow, November 15th. Your first major political confrontation since returning from campaign.\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts as you prepare for tomorrow?"
