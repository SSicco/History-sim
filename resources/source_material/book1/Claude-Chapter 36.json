      "say": "Thought process: Locating project files to resume negotiations.\n\nThe user is asking to continue Chapter 36 of their historical RPG set in 1430s Castile. They want to pick up where they left off and continue negotiations. I need to:\n\n1. Search the project knowledge to find where Chapter 35 ended (since we're starting Chapter 36)\n2. Understand the current situation and what negotiations are ongoing\n3. Continue the narrative from that point\n4. Follow the critical rule: NEVER write dialogue or actions for Juan II - stop and wait for player input\n5. Keep responses SHORT during active negotiations (2-4 paragraphs)\n6. Maintain historical realism and authenticity\n\nLet me search the project files to find the most recent chapter and understand the current situation.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Contextualized narrative position and awaited player dialogue input.\n\nExcellent, I found where Chapter 35 ended. Let me understand the situation:\n\n**Current Situation at End of Chapter 35:**\n- Date: April 16, 1432 (Late Afternoon)\n- Location: Moclín\n- Juan is negotiating with Moclín garrison\n- The garrison has just responded positively to Juan's offer of terms, willing to discuss surrender\n- Two officers emerged: a younger officer and Commander Rahman al-Zagal (older, more ornately armored)\n- They're asking detailed questions about:\n  1. The prisoners at Antequera - when will they be released?\n  2. How long might the crusade last?\n  3. What does \"Christian rule\" mean for those who stay?\n  4. What protections do they have that terms won't change once weapons laid down?\n\nThe garrison is united and wants to negotiate seriously, not refusing out of pride. They're showing respect for Juan's personal visit and want to respond with equal respect by negotiating properly.\n\nKey context from earlier in Chapter 35:\n- Íllora was costly: 87 Castilian dead, 164 wounded, ~200 Moorish dead in combat\n- 385 garrison troops captured at Íllora, held at Antequera\n- The garrison at Íllora refused terms and it cost both sides dearly\n- Moclín garrison learned from this and is willing to talk\n\nNow the user says \"I continue the negotiations\" - this means Juan is responding to their questions. But I MUST NOT write Juan's dialogue. I need to STOP and wait for the player to provide Juan's actual words in response to the garrison's questions.\n\nFollowing the critical rule: I should NOT continue with a long description. During active negotiations/dialogue, I should keep it SHORT (2-4 paragraphs) and STOP after presenting the situation so Juan can respond.\n\nHowever, the user just said \"I continue the negotiations\" without providing specific dialogue. I should remind them what questions are being asked and wait for them to provide Juan's actual response.\n\n\nCHAPTER 36: THE PRICE OF WISDOM\n\n\nDate: April 16, 1432 (Late Afternoon)\nLocation: Moclín, Granada\n\n\n\nThe two officers stand before you in the growing shadows of late afternoon. Commander Rahman al-Zagal's ornate armor catches the fading light as he studies your face, waiting. Behind them at the gatehouse, you can see other garrison members watching intently—no division here, no internal conflict. Just soldiers waiting to hear answers that will determine whether they open these gates or die defending them.\n\n\nThe younger officer's questions hang in the air:\n\n\n\"The prisoners at Antequera—you swear they will be released when the crusade ends? How long might that be? What exactly does 'Christian rule' mean for those who stay? What protections do we have that these terms won't change once we've laid down our weapons?\"\n\n\nRahman al-Zagal adds quietly: \"Your Majesty has come in person to offer terms. This shows respect. We wish to respond with equal respect—by negotiating seriously, not refusing out of pride or fear. But we must understand what we're agreeing to before we open these gates.\"\n\n\nThree hundred fifty men wait for your answers.\n\n\nWhat do you say?"

      "say": "Thought process: Architected persuasion mechanics balancing historical realism with success and failure factors.\n\nThe user wants me to create a d100 table for how the Moclín garrison responds to Juan's explanation of terms. This is a persuasion roll situation, so I need to follow the revised mechanics:\n\n1. First, I need to identify Success Factors and Failure Factors\n2. Then create a d100 table where BOTH sets of factors persist across all outcomes\n3. The roll determines HOW the factors play out, not WHETHER they exist\n\nLet me analyze Juan's approach:\n\n**SUCCESS FACTORS (real strengths that exist regardless of roll):**\n- Juan has come in person, showing genuine respect\n- Terms ARE objectively generous by medieval standards (safe conduct, no forced conversions, prisoner release)\n- Juan has demonstrated he keeps his word (Íllora example shows he honored modified terms even after refusal)\n- Military reality is overwhelming - they're surrounded, outgunned, cannot be relieved\n- Islamic greeting and cultural respect in approach\n- Offers to consider additional requests\n- Living under Christian rule with religious freedom is better than death\n- Prisoners at Antequera ARE being treated fairly (this can be verified)\n\n**FAILURE FACTORS (real concerns that exist regardless of roll):**\n- \"Just my word\" is not a legal guarantee - what prevents future breaking?\n- Crusade timeline is vague - could be months or years of captivity\n- Íllora's example is double-edged: yes he kept his word, but the terms got HARDER after refusal\n- What happens to property rights under Christian rule?\n- Religious freedom sounds good but what about Islamic courts, marriage law, inheritance?\n- Fear that \"no forced conversions\" might not apply to children or economic pressure\n- Sultan Yusuf might punish families in Granada if they surrender\n- Honor concerns - they're professional soldiers surrendering without fighting\n- Trust is hard - Christians and Muslims have been enemies for 700 years\n\nNow I need to create a d100 table where:\n- LOW rolls (1-25): Failure factors dominate, success factors acknowledged but don't persuade, hostile or fearful response\n\n\n- MID rolls (26-75): Mixed response, genuine negotiation, both factors in play\n- HIGH rolls (76-100): Success factors resonate strongly, failure factors raised constructively, willing to work toward agreement\n\nI'll craft nuanced medieval responses that reflect the complex negotiation dynamics. The table will show how the same underlying concerns can be interpreted differently based on the persuasive context.\n\n\nMOCLÍN SURRENDER NEGOTIATION - D100 OUTCOME TABLE\n\n\nI'll first analyze the Success and Failure Factors, then create the custom table.\n\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (Legitimate strengths of your position)\n\n\nYou came in person, showing genuine respect (unprecedented for a king)\n\nTerms ARE objectively generous by medieval conquest standards\n\nYou've demonstrated you keep your word (Íllora example)\n\nMilitary reality is overwhelming - surrounded, outgunned, no relief possible\n\nIslamic greeting and cultural respect in your approach\n\nYou offered to consider additional requests\n\nReligious freedom under Christian rule is better than death\n\nPrisoners at Antequera can be verified as treated fairly\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (Real concerns they have)\n\n\n\"My word\" lacks legal enforceability - what prevents future breaking?\n\nCrusade timeline vague - months or years of captivity?\n\nÍllora example is double-edged: you kept your word BUT terms got harder after refusal\n\nProperty rights, Islamic courts, marriage law, inheritance under \"Christian rule\" undefined\n\n\"No forced conversions\" - but what about children? Economic pressure? Subtle coercion?\n\nSultan Yusuf might punish families in Granada for surrender\n\nProfessional military honor - surrendering without fighting\n\n700 years of Christian-Muslim conflict breeds deep distrust\n\n\n\nD100 OUTCOME TABLE\n\n\n1-15: HOSTILE REJECTION - Failure Factors Dominate\nThe younger officer's face hardens. \"Your Majesty's words are kind, but 'your word' is not enough. We have families in Granada who will be punished if we surrender. The Sultan will call us traitors.\" Rahman interjects coldly: \"At Íllora, you offered generous terms, they refused, and your terms became HARSHER. You rewarded stubbornness with harder conditions. What stops you from doing the same here once we're disarmed? Your 'word' changes based on convenience.\" Others at the gate are nodding—your Íllora precedent is being used AGAINST you. \"Christian rule with no forced conversions—we've heard these promises before. What about our children? Our mosques? Our courts? 'Live and prosper' means nothing when our law, our property, our way of life can be taken at Christian whim.\" The military reality exists, but fear and distrust overwhelm rational calculation. They withdraw into the fortress. You hear heated argument within—your words haven't convinced the commanders, though some soldiers clearly waiver.\n\n\n16-25: FEARFUL RESISTANCE - Concerns Outweigh Logic\nRahman speaks carefully: \"Your Majesty, we do not doubt your personal honor in this moment. But 'Christian rule' is vague. Our families own property. We have courts that judge by shariah. We have marriage customs. What happens to these? You say no forced conversions, but Christians tax non-believers heavily, yes? Economic pressure achieves what force does not.\" The younger officer adds: \"The prisoners at Antequera—'after the crusade concludes.' When? Six months? Two years? Five? And who decides when it's concluded?\" Your generous terms ARE acknowledged, but their specific concerns aren't addressed. They're professional soldiers reading between lines and finding gaps. \"Your Majesty offers more than most conquerors. But we need specifics, not assurances. We need something we can trust beyond personal word—something that survives even if Your Majesty dies tomorrow and another king rules.\" They're not rejecting outright, but genuine fear prevents acceptance without more concrete protections.\n\n\n26-40: CAUTIOUS NEGOTIATION - Real Concerns Need Addressing\nRahman nods slowly. \"Your Majesty's terms are generous compared to what many would offer. Coming in person shows respect we appreciate.\" But he continues seriously: \"Yet 'Christian rule' must be defined. If we stay, what law governs property disputes between Muslims? Can we maintain our courts for internal matters? Our mosques and waqf endowments—are these protected legally, not just by royal favor that could change?\" The younger officer: \"The prisoners—we understand not wanting to fight them again. That's military logic we respect. But 'when crusade concludes' needs definition. Is it when Granada city falls? When Sultan Yusuf surrenders? If warfare continues for years, do they remain imprisoned?\" They're taking your offer seriously but pushing for specifics. \"Your Majesty, we're willing to discuss seriously. But we need terms we can explain to our men, to families, to those who question whether we're wise or cowardly. Give us concrete answers we can bring back. Then we can negotiate properly.\"\n\n\n41-60: SUBSTANTIVE DIALOGUE - Both Sides Engaging Honestly\n\"Your Majesty honors us with personal presence and Islamic greeting,\" Rahman says with genuine respect. \"These terms are better than many Christian kings would offer.\" He glances back at his officers, then continues: \"We accept that you've won militarily. The bombards that broke Íllora in days can break us in a week. We cannot be relieved. We're not blind to military reality.\" But then the specifics: \"Yet we must understand details. 'Christian rule with no forced conversions'—we need this in writing, sealed, with specific protections. Islamic courts for Muslim internal matters? Protection for mosques and religious endowments? Inheritance law? These matter to families staying behind.\" On prisoners: \"We understand keeping Íllora garrison as prisoners—they refused mercy and cost you blood. Military logic. But timeline matters. Can you define 'crusade's conclusion'? Fall of major fortresses? Sultan's surrender? Give us something specific.\" They're negotiating seriously, raising real concerns constructively. \"Your Majesty, if you grant written charter protecting Islamic law and property for those who stay, and define prisoner release as 'when major Granada fortresses fall or within two years, whichever comes first'—then we have terms we can accept. Can we negotiate these specifics?\"\n\n\n61-75: POSITIVE MOMENTUM - Agreement Seems Achievable\nRahman actually smiles slightly. \"Your Majesty, you come in person under flag of truce, speak our greeting with respect, offer generous terms and ask what else might sway us. This is... unusual. Honorable.\" The younger officer adds: \"We're soldiers. We know when we're beaten. Your bombards broke Íllora's walls in days. You have 12,000 troops. We have 350. Sultan Yusuf cannot reach us in time. Continuing resistance means death for nothing.\" They exchange glances, clearly impressed by your approach. \"The terms you offer—safe conduct with honor, protection for civilians, no forced conversions, prisoner release when crusade ends—these are genuinely good. Better than we expected.\" But they still need specifics: \"Your Majesty, if you would grant a written charter guaranteeing Islamic religious and property rights for those who stay—with royal seal—and define prisoner release as 'when Granada's major fortresses fall or within two years,' then we can open these gates tomorrow with honor intact.\" They're almost there. This feels like finalization, not fundamental negotiation. \"We believe Your Majesty's word. We've seen how you treated Íllora garrison even after they refused. But give us something concrete to show our men, and we can end this without more blood.\"\n\n\n76-90: STRONG AGREEMENT - Details to Finalize\n\"Your Majesty,\" Rahman says with clear respect, \"you honor us by coming personally. The Islamic greeting, the offer to consider requests, the acknowledgment that we've fought with honor—these matter.\" He glances at his officers, who are nodding. \"We're professionals. We know military reality. We cannot win. We cannot be relieved. Continuing costs lives for outcome already decided.\" The younger officer speaks warmly: \"Your terms are generous. Safe conduct with honor. Protection for civilians and families. No forced conversions. Prisoner release after crusade. These are better than standard siege terms by far.\" Then specifics, raised constructively: \"Your Majesty, we'd like written charter—formal document with royal seal—specifying Islamic religious freedom, property protections, and court rights for internal Muslim matters. And for prisoner release, perhaps 'when major Granada fortresses fall or within two years'? This gives concrete timeline soldiers understand.\" They're clearly ready to agree—just finalizing details. \"If Your Majesty grants these reasonable additions, we can surrender honorably tomorrow. Our men will accept—they see the military reality and trust your demonstrated honor from Íllora. We're not fighting to die. We're fighting for terms that let us live with honor. You offer those terms.\"\n\n\n91-100: ENTHUSIASTIC ACCEPTANCE - Immediate Agreement\nRahman al-Zagal steps forward and actually bows with respect. \"Your Majesty, we accept your terms. Completely and immediately.\" There's visible relief among the officers behind him. \"You came in person to offer mercy. You spoke our greeting. You acknowledged our honor and offered to consider our concerns. This is leadership worthy of respect.\" The younger officer adds emotionally: \"Your Majesty, we're soldiers. We know when resistance is suicide versus valor. We have 350 men against 12,000. Your bombards broke Íllora in days. No relief is coming. Continuing means death for pride, not duty.\" Rahman continues: \"Your terms are extraordinarily generous. Safe conduct with honor. Protection for civilians. No forced conversions. Prisoner release after crusade. These are better than we hoped.\" He pauses, then: \"We would appreciate written charter confirming Islamic rights for those who stay—formal protection we can show families. And if Your Majesty could specify prisoner release timeline—perhaps 'when major fortresses fall or within two years'—this would help us explain to our men why surrender is wisdom, not cowardice.\" But he's already decided: \"Yet even without these additions, your demonstrated honor at Íllora convinces us. You kept your word even after they refused. You offered mercy three days ago, they rejected, you modified terms but kept core protections. This shows true character.\" He looks back at his garrison. \"We surrender Moclín. Tomorrow morning, we open the gates. Our men leave with honor, or stay with protection. You've won not just militarily, but honorably. Allah witnesses that we fought well, and that you offered mercy justly. We accept.\"\n\n\n\nWhen you're ready, roll your d100 and I'll narrate the outcome based on your roll and their response to your specific terms."

This means:\n\n- They're taking the offer seriously and engaging constructively\n- They acknowledge the military reality\n- They respect Juan's approach and honor\n- But they need specific details before they can accept\n- They're raising concerns not as objections but as items to negotiate\n- This is genuine negotiation, not resistance\n\nKey points from the 41-60 outcome:\n- They appreciate his personal presence and Islamic greeting\n- They acknowledge the military reality (bombards, numbers, no relief)\n- They want specifics on \"Christian rule\" - courts, property, inheritance\n- They want timeline definition for prisoner release\n- They're asking for written charter with protections\n- They suggest specific compromise: \"Fall of major fortresses or within two years\"\n- Tone is constructive negotiation, not hostile\n\nI need to narrate this outcome without generating any dialogue or actions for Juan. I should:\n1. Show Rahman and the younger officer responding\n2. Have them acknowledge the good parts of Juan's offer\n3. Have them raise specific concerns constructively\n4. Have them suggest concrete solutions\n5. Stop when it's Juan's turn to respond\n\nKeep it SHORT during active dialogue - 2-4 paragraphs as per the instructions.\n\n\nRahman al-Zagal nods slowly, his expression thoughtful rather than hostile. \"Your Majesty honors us with your presence and your greeting. These terms are better than many Christian kings would offer after siege and bombardment.\"\n\n\nHe exchanges a glance with the younger officer, then continues: \"We accept that you have won this militarily. Your bombards broke Íllora's walls in days—they can break ours in a week. We have three hundred fifty men. You have twelve thousand. Sultan Yusuf cannot reach us even if he wished to. We are not blind to this reality.\"\n\n\nBut then he steps slightly closer, his tone becoming more specific: \"Yet we must understand the details, Your Majesty. 'Christian rule with no forced conversions'—we need this protection in writing, sealed, with specifics we can show our men and their families. When disputes arise between Muslims over property or inheritance, what law applies? Can we maintain Islamic courts for our internal matters? Our mosques and religious endowments—are these legally protected, not merely by royal favor that might change with the next king?\"\n\n\nThe younger officer adds: \"And the prisoners at Antequera, Your Majesty—we understand the military logic of keeping them. They refused mercy and cost you blood. We respect that calculation. But 'when the crusade concludes' needs definition. Does it mean when Granada city falls? When Sultan Yusuf surrenders? If warfare continues for years, do they remain imprisoned indefinitely?\"\n\n\nRahman's voice remains respectful but firm: \"Your Majesty, we are willing to discuss this seriously and reach agreement. But we need terms concrete enough to explain to our men—to answer the questions their families will ask. Can we negotiate these specifics?\"\n\n\nBoth officers wait for your response."

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed negotiation dynamics and anticipated conflicted but continued engagement.\n\nThe player has provided Juan's response. This is a substantive shift in the negotiation - Juan is being transparent about what Christian rule actually means, which is significant. Let me analyze what he's offering:\n\nPOSITIVES:\n- Shows them the papal bull (concrete document)\n- Explicit written prohibition on forced conversion\n- Specific timeline for prisoner release (fall of Granada city + major forts)\n- Willing to put it in writing\n- Honest about what Christian rule means (not hiding the truth)\n- Acknowledges they won't like it\n- Respectful tone\n\nNEGATIVES:\n- Mosques will be converted to churches (this is a MAJOR issue)\n- No Islamic courts even for internal matters\n- Christian law applies to everyone\n- Islam becomes minority religion with implied restrictions\n- Comparisons to past Muslim rule won't necessarily comfort them\n\nThis is a significant moment. Juan is being honest rather than making vague promises. But he's also revealing that \"Christian rule\" means genuine cultural/religious subjugation, not just political overlordship. The mosque conversion is particularly painful - these are sacred spaces.\n\nGiven the roll was 44 (middle of the Substantive Dialogue range), they were engaging honestly and looking for specifics. Juan has now provided specifics - but the specifics are harder than they hoped.\n\nI need to show them processing this. This is a difficult moment. They wanted protections; Juan is offering limited protections (no forced conversion, but cultural dominance). The mosque issue will be particularly painful.\n\nThey're professional soldiers facing military reality. They were willing to negotiate. But this is harder than expected. How do they respond?\n\nOptions:\n1. Accept reluctantly (military reality forces it)\n2. Push back on specific issues (especially mosques)\n3. Ask for concessions to soften the blow\n4. Withdraw to consult with garrison\n\nGiven they were in \"substantive dialogue\" mode and are professionals, they probably won't reject outright. But this is a painful revelation. They'll likely respond with visible disappointment but continued engagement, possibly trying to negotiate on the mosque issue or asking for something to make it more palatable.\n \nI see hushed conversations among their leadership. Quiet, controlled frustration ripples through the group. They exchange meaningful glances, weighing their limited options. A senior commander steps forward, his body language tense but controlled. They're processing the harsh realities - acknowledging the military constraints while seeking any possible softening of these terms.\n\n\nA messenger quickly retrieves the papal bull from your command tent. When it arrives, Rahman and the younger officer study it carefully, heads bent together as they read the Latin text with evident difficulty. One of the garrison members behind them—apparently more educated—comes forward to help translate.\n\n\nAfter several minutes, Rahman straightens. \"The prohibition on forced conversion is here, written plainly. And the crusade's end is defined—when the Sultan's power is broken and major strongholds taken.\" He nods slowly. \"This is concrete. This we can verify.\"\n\n\nThe prisoner release timeline clearly relieves them—the younger officer's shoulders visibly relax. \"Fall of Granada city and major fortresses. A real timeline. Months, perhaps a year, not indefinite imprisonment. This is fair, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nBut then you explain about Christian law, about the mosques.\n\n\nThe change in atmosphere is immediate and palpable. Rahman's face goes carefully neutral—the expression of a man absorbing a blow. The younger officer actually flinches. Behind them, you hear sharp intakes of breath from the garrison members listening.\n\n\nRahman is silent for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice is tight with controlled emotion: \"The mosques, Your Majesty. You would take our sacred spaces? Convert them to churches?\"\n\n\nThe younger officer adds quietly, pain evident: \"We have prayed in Moclín's mosque for generations. Our fathers, their fathers. The mihrab points to Makkah. It is... it is sacred ground, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nRahman raises a hand to silence his companion, then turns back to you. His professional demeanor is struggling against visible distress. \"Your Majesty is honest. We... we appreciate that you do not hide the truth to secure easy surrender.\"\n\n\nHe exchanges a long look with the other officers. An unspoken conversation passes between them—the weight of military reality pressing against cultural devastation.\n\n\nFinally Rahman speaks again: \"Your Majesty, you say you are responsible for stability in your realm. We understand this. But the mosque—could it not remain, even if we are few? Even if we are minority? A small space for our prayers?\" His voice grows quieter. \"You speak of magnanimous victory. The papal bull forbids forced conversion of souls. But taking our sacred space forces us to choose between faith and homeland.\"\n\n\nThe younger officer adds: \"Our families who stay—where do they pray the five daily prayers? In secret, like criminals? This is... this is very hard, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nBoth officers wait, clearly hoping for some concession on this specific point, even as they recognize the larger framework you've outlined.\n\n\nWhat is your response?"

This is a smart move - getting expert opinion on what exactly is required versus what might have flexibility. I should:\n\n1. Have a friar arrive (probably one traveling with the army)\n2. Have him examine the relevant passage\n3. Present the theological/canonical interpretation\n4. Maybe show some flexibility exists, or maybe not - depends on what the bull actually says\n5.

Within minutes, he arrives—his Franciscan robes dusty from the road, his face showing curiosity at being summoned to the gates.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty?\" he asks, then notices the Muslim officers and the papal bull in Rahman's hands. His expression shifts to understanding.\n\n\nYou explain the situation—the negotiation, the question of mosques, and ask him to examine the bull's specific language about sacred spaces.\n\n\nFray Hernando takes the document and reads carefully, his lips moving slightly as he works through the Latin. Rahman and the younger officer watch him intently, barely breathing.\n\n\nAfter several minutes, Fray Hernando looks up. \"Your Majesty, the relevant passage states: 'Mosques and places of Saracen worship in conquered territories shall be cleansed and consecrated to Christian use.' This is standard language in crusading bulls—it's meant to symbolize Christ's triumph over false worship.\"\n\n\nRahman's face falls. The younger officer closes his eyes briefly.\n\n\nBut Fray Hernando continues, his tone thoughtful: \"However, Your Majesty, the bull speaks of 'places of Saracen worship' in the context of conquest. It demands that mosques be converted to churches, yes—but...\" He pauses, choosing his words carefully. \"It does not explicitly forbid private prayer spaces for Muslims who remain under Christian rule. The Church's concern is public worship of false religion, not private devotion.\"\n\n\nHe glances at the Muslim officers, then back to you. \"Your Majesty, if the main mosque were consecrated as a church—fulfilling the bull's requirement—a smaller building or private space for Muslim prayer would not technically violate the document. The Church has allowed Jews to maintain synagogues in Christian lands. The legal precedent exists, though it is... delicate.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando adds carefully: \"This would need to be framed correctly. Not as 'keeping the mosque,' but as permitting private Muslim prayer space under Christian rule. The distinction matters canonically.\"\n\n\nRahman's eyes have widened slightly—a flicker of hope. The younger officer leans forward, listening intently.\n\n\nFray Hernando concludes: \"Your Majesty, I can only advise on Church law. The decision is yours. But converting the main mosque to a church while permitting a smaller prayer space would not violate the papal bull's letter or spirit. It fulfills the requirement while showing mercy to those who submit.\"\n\n\nHe falls silent, waiting for your judgment. Rahman and his officers stare at you with barely contained hope. Behind them, the garrison members at the gate have pressed forward, trying to hear.\n\n\nWhat do you say?"

Retcon that it wasn't Fray Hernando (who is heading to Basel) but another friar\n2. Juan is asking if there's a priest/friar with the army who can stay in Moclín for years to ensure terms are honored\n3. If so, bring him forward\n\nThis is a smart move by Juan - having a clerical witness and long-term guarantor of the terms. Let me think about who this could be...\n\nThe army would have multiple chaplains and friars. One could be assigned to stay as the local priest for the new Christian community while also serving as a witness to the surrender terms. This would be realistic - conquered territories need priests, and having one who witnessed the surrender terms ensures continuity.\n\nI should:\n- Acknowledge the retcon smoothly\n- Introduce a friar who can stay long-term\n- Show how this could work as a guarantee mechanism\n- Let the Muslim officers react to this proposal\n- Stop when Juan needs to respond\n\nThis is good - Juan is finding a creative solution that provides real institutional backing beyond just his personal word.\n\n\nThe friar who has just spoken—a Benedictine named Fray Sebastián, one of the army chaplains—nods at your question. \"Your Majesty, I am indeed prepared to remain. When territories are conquered, priests must stay to minister to the Christian population and oversee the spiritual administration.\"\n\n\nHe's a man in his forties, solid and practical-looking, with the weathered face of someone who has spent years in frontier parishes. \"I have served in border regions before, Your Majesty. I understand how to navigate... complex situations between faiths.\"\n\n\nAnother figure steps forward from among the chaplains—an older Franciscan with gray in his beard. \"Your Majesty, I am Fray Miguel. I also volunteer to remain if needed. Two priests would better serve a garrison town, and provide witness to agreements made.\"\n\n\nFray Sebastián turns to Rahman and the younger officer. \"If His Majesty permits, we could serve as guarantors of the terms discussed here. What is agreed upon today, sealed and witnessed, would be our sacred duty to uphold. We would be here—not in Toledo, not traveling with the army—but here in Moclín, ensuring the terms are honored.\"\n\n\nFray Miguel adds quietly: \"The Church values her word, as does His Majesty. If agreements are written and witnessed by clergy who remain, this provides... permanence beyond any single man's life.\"\n\n\nRahman exchanges a look with his officers. The younger officer speaks carefully: \"Your Majesty, this is... unexpected. You offer to leave witnesses who will hold both sides accountable?\" There's cautious hope in his voice. \"Christians who will ensure the terms are kept, even after you march away?\"\n\n\nRahman studies the two friars carefully, then looks back to you. \"Your Majesty, if these men of God witness what we agree upon today—if they stay and hold both Christians and Muslims to the terms—this addresses our concern about enforceability. Your word would have permanent guardians.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then adds: \"But we must know exactly what we are agreeing to. The mosque question—can Your Majesty clarify? The main mosque becomes a church, but a smaller prayer space for Muslims who remain? Written in the agreement these friars witness?\"\n\n\nWhat do you tell them?"

More than we expected. But...\" He looks back at his men. \"The main mosque—our sacred space for generations—becomes a church. Christian law governs our property, our disputes, our lives. We become... tolerated guests in our own town.\" The younger officer adds bitterly: \"A 'smaller building' for prayer? We go from a mosque our grandfathers built to some shed, at Christian mercy?\" Despite the military reality, despite Juan's genuine concessions, the emotional weight proves too much. \"Your Majesty, we cannot. To surrender without fighting, to accept our mosque's conversion, to live under Christian law—we would be traitors to everything. We will defend Moclín. If we die, we die with honor intact.\" They withdraw into the fortress. Even good terms cannot overcome 700 years of conflict when pride is at stake.\n\n\n6-15: PAINFUL REJECTION - Terms Not Enough\n\"Your Majesty has tried to find middle ground,\" Rahman says with genuine regret. \"The clergy staying as witnesses shows good faith. The prayer space is more than many would offer. We acknowledge this.\" But his face is strained. \"Yet the main mosque becomes a church. Our sacred space, desecrated. Christian law governs our property and lives. We become minorities in our own town, dependent on Christian mercy that could change with the next king.\" The younger officer adds: \"Your Majesty keeps your word today. But these friars—they answer to bishops who answer to popes. What happens when Church policy changes? When economic pressure makes Islam impossible? We trade fighting death for slow cultural death.\" Military reality exists, but the terms ask too much. \"We respect Your Majesty's honor. But we cannot accept. We will defend Moclín.\" They retreat into the fortress, clearly pained but unwilling to surrender on these terms.\n\n\n16-30: DIVIDED GARRISON - Internal Conflict\nRahman and the younger officer exchange a long look. \"Your Majesty, these terms are... more than expected. The clergy staying, the prayer space, the written guarantees.\" But then Rahman turns back toward the gate, calling out in Arabic. Heated argument erupts inside—clearly the garrison is splitting. Some voices shout acceptance, others rejection. After several minutes, Rahman turns back, his face troubled. \"Your Majesty, our garrison is divided. Perhaps half would accept these terms. They see the military reality and value their lives. But others—they cannot accept the mosque's conversion, cannot surrender without fighting, cannot trust Christian promises despite your honor.\" The younger officer adds: \"We need time to discuss among ourselves. To convince the resisters or... separate from them. Can Your Majesty grant us until tomorrow morning? We will either open the gates united in surrender, or give you clear answer if we cannot agree.\"\n\n\n31-50: RELUCTANT ACCEPTANCE - Reality Wins Over Pride\nRahman is silent for a long moment, his face showing the internal struggle. Finally: \"Your Majesty has offered more than we had right to expect. The papal bull forbids forced conversion—we can verify this. The prisoners will be released when Granada falls—a timeline we understand. You provide clergy as permanent witnesses. You permit Muslim prayer space when you could prohibit it entirely.\" He looks at his officers, seeing their reluctant nods. \"The main mosque becoming a church—this pains us deeply. Living under Christian law, as minorities—this is bitter. But...\" He meets your eyes directly. \"We are soldiers. We know military reality. We cannot win. We cannot be relieved. You offer life and limited freedom over death and nothing. We would be fools to refuse.\" The younger officer adds quietly: \"Our families can still pray. Our faith continues, even if diminished. We live to see another day. Perhaps this is wisdom, not cowardice.\" Rahman nods slowly: \"We accept Your Majesty's terms. We will surrender Moclín tomorrow morning. Let the agreement be written and witnessed by these friars. We trust your demonstrated honor, even if we hate the necessity.\"\n\n\n51-70: PRAGMATIC ACCEPTANCE - Terms Are Fair\n\"Your Majesty,\" Rahman says with clear respect, \"you have negotiated fairly. You showed us the papal bull—the prohibition on forced conversion is written there. You defined when prisoners are released—when Granada and major fortresses fall. You consulted clergy to find solution for prayer space rather than simply forbidding it. You offer two friars to stay as permanent witnesses.\" He glances at his officers, seeing agreement. \"The main mosque becoming a church is painful. We will not pretend otherwise. Living under Christian law as minorities is not what we hoped. But—\" He gestures at the walls around them. \"We are surrounded. You have twelve thousand men and bombards that broke Íllora in days. Sultan Yusuf cannot reach us. These are facts.\" The younger officer adds: \"Your Majesty's terms are genuinely fair by the standards of conquest. You offer written guarantees, permanent witnesses, protection for families, religious freedom within limits. We see leaders who refuse good terms out of pride—Commander Hamza at Íllora died in chains because he wouldn't negotiate.\" Rahman nods: \"We accept, Your Majesty. Let the agreement be written. We surrender Moclín with honor intact—we negotiated as professionals, not as men driven by fear or foolish pride. Tomorrow morning, the gates open.\"\n\n\n71-85: RELIEVED ACCEPTANCE - Grateful for Solution\nRahman actually smiles, clearly relieved. \"Your Majesty, when you arrived at our gates, we feared the worst. We thought you would demand total submission or death. Instead—\" He holds up the papal bull. \"You showed us written guarantees. You consulted your clergy to find solutions. You offered permanent witnesses to hold both sides accountable. You permit prayer space for those who stay. This is... this is leadership worth respecting.\" The younger officer adds emotionally: \"Our men were prepared to die defending this fortress. Now they can live, can keep their faith, can protect their families. Yes, the mosque becomes a church—that hurts. Yes, we live under Christian law—that's difficult. But Your Majesty could have taken everything. Instead you negotiated fairly and found middle ground.\" Rahman steps forward: \"We accept completely, Your Majesty. Let the agreement be written tonight. Tomorrow morning, we open the gates. Our garrison will either leave under safe conduct or stay with protections. Either way, no more blood needs to be spilled. You have won this fortress not just with bombards but with honor and wisdom.\" Behind them, you can hear relief spreading through the garrison—men who expected to die realizing they might live.\n\n\n86-95: ENTHUSIASTIC ACCEPTANCE - Genuine Gratitude\n\"Your Majesty,\" Rahman says with deep respect, bowing his head, \"you have shown extraordinary leadership today. You came in person to offer terms. You brought the papal bull to prove your promises. When we raised concerns about the mosque, you didn't dismiss us—you consulted your clergy to find a solution.\" The younger officer is visibly emotional: \"Your Majesty, we are professional soldiers. We've fought Christians for years. We expected slaughter or slavery when Moclín fell. Instead you offer written protections, permanent clergy witnesses, prayer space for Muslims, prisoner release on concrete timeline. This is... this is merciful beyond our hopes.\" Rahman continues: \"The main mosque becoming a church—yes, this pains us. But you found a way to preserve our faith within Christian law. You showed the papal document proving no forced conversion. You're leaving friars who will hold both sides accountable. This is not just generous—this is wise governance.\" He looks back at his garrison, seeing hope replacing fear. \"We accept your terms, Your Majesty. Completely and with gratitude. Tomorrow morning, the gates open. You have our surrender, our respect, and our word that we will honor this agreement. You've shown that Christian and Muslim can live under just rule. Perhaps there is path to peace after all.\"\n\n\n96-100: IMMEDIATE SURRENDER WITH HONOR\nRahman al-Zagal steps forward and goes to one knee, his hand over his heart—a gesture of deep respect. \"Your Majesty, we surrender Moclín. Now. Tonight. Immediately.\" Behind him, the younger officer is openly relieved, nearly joyful. \"Your Majesty, what you have done here is extraordinary. You came in person under flag of truce. You brought the papal bull proving your promises. When we raised concerns, you didn't threaten—you consulted your scholars to find solutions. You offered permanent witnesses, written guarantees, religious freedom within the constraints of your faith and law.\" Rahman rises: \"Other Christian kings would have simply destroyed us. You negotiated with honor and found middle ground that respects both our faiths. The mosque becomes a church—we understand why this must be. But you permit prayer space. You prove forced conversion is forbidden. You define prisoner release timeline. You leave friars who will ensure both sides honor the agreement.\" The younger officer adds: \"Your Majesty, we entered this negotiation expecting to die. Now we can live with honor intact. Our families can stay safely. Our faith continues. This is... this is a miracle of diplomacy.\" Rahman calls back to the fortress in Arabic. The gates begin to open immediately. \"Your Majesty, why wait until tomorrow? We surrender now. Tonight, we feast together as men of honor. Tomorrow, we arrange details. But the decision is made. You have won Moclín not just militarily but through wisdom and justice. Allah witnesses that we fought bravely and surrendered honorably to a king worthy of respect.\"\n\n\n\nWhen you're ready, roll your d100 and I'll narrate the outcome."

He actually smiles, something warm and genuine replacing the tension that has held him rigid throughout the negotiation.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, and there's gratitude in his voice, \"when you arrived at our gates this afternoon, we feared the worst.

A messenger departs immediately for Toledo, the letter sealed with wax.\n\n\nThe second to Álvaro—strategic, political. You emphasize the narrative: the mad count's folly, his family's wisdom in surrendering, the swift and bloodless assault, royal authority triumphant. The messenger for Toledo carries both letters.\n\n\n\nTHE RIDE TO ÍLLORA\n\n\nApril 17-18, 1432\n\n\nDawn breaks over Moclín with the gates opening peacefully. True to their word, Rahman and his officers emerge with 350 men. Approximately 180 choose safe conduct to Granada—they depart under escort with their weapons and banners. The remaining 170 choose to stay, trusting in the written agreement.\n\n\nYou leave a garrison of 150 men under a capable captain, with Fray Sebastián and Fray Miguel settling into the town to begin their work as permanent witnesses. By mid-morning, you're riding southwest with your 3,050 remaining troops from the northern force.\n\n\nThe ride takes a day and a half. You push hard, covering the 35 miles through the mountain passes to Íllora. Infante Juan rides at your side, clearly relieved that no blood was shed at Moclín.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says as you ride, \"the men are talking about what happened. You negotiated surrender without firing a shot. After Íllora's cost... this matters. They see wisdom, not just strength.\"\n\n\n\nREUNION AT ÍLLORA - APRIL 18, EVENING\n\n\nYou arrive at Íllora as the sun sets. The main army camp sprawls across the hills west of the town—12,750 men, five bombards, supply trains, everything organized and maintained during your week away.\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna rides out to meet you, relief evident on his face. \"Your Majesty! Thank God. We received word of Moclín's surrender—congratulations. Two fortresses taken in a week, one with negotiation instead of assault.\" He falls in beside you as you ride into camp. \"The men needed this. Íllora's cost was heavy. Seeing that bloodshed can be avoided when commanders are wise—this strengthens morale considerably.\"\n\n\nAs you dismount at the command tent, he continues: \"Your Majesty, we need to discuss next moves. The army is ready, supplies are good, morale recovering. But we must decide our strategy now that we control Íllora and Moclín.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to the command tent where maps await. \"Granada city lies 25 miles northeast—but heavily fortified, large garrison, the Sultan's seat of power. Alhama de Granada lies 25 miles southeast—smaller, strategically vital, controls mountain passes. Or we could push west toward Loja to link with the coastal forces eventually.\"\n\n\nInside the tent, senior commanders are gathering—your cousin Infante Juan just arriving with his officers, the Master of Santiago, Don Fadrique, artillery commanders, cavalry captains.

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed strategic military considerations for two siege approaches.\n\nJuan is asking for strategic advice from his commanders about whether to march on Granada city directly or take Alhama de Granada first. This is an interesting strategic question and the commanders would have different perspectives.\n\nLet me think about the realistic medieval military considerations:\n\n1. Granada city - the capital, heavily fortified, large garrison, Sultan's seat of power. Taking it would essentially end the war, but it's the toughest target. The question is whether they might surrender when confronted with overwhelming force.\n\n2. Alhama de Granada - smaller fortress, strategically important (controls mountain passes), easier target. Taking it first weakens Granada's position before assaulting the capital.\n\nThe commanders would debate:\n- Military prudence (isolate and weaken before final assault)\n- Psychological impact (showing up at Granada might cause panic/surrender)\n- Risk assessment (what if Granada doesn't surrender and we've wasted time?)\n- Supply lines and logistics\n- Enemy reinforcements arriving\n\nÁlvaro would likely be cautious and strategic. Other commanders might have different views. Some might be bold and favor striking directly at the heart. Others might be conservative.\n\nI should present multiple perspectives from different commanders, let them debate realistically, and avoid making the decision for Juan. I should stop after presenting the debate and wait for Juan's decision.\n\n\nÁlvaro studies the map carefully, then looks up at the assembled commanders. \"Your Majesty raises the central question. Let me offer my assessment, then others should speak.\"\n\n\nHe points to Granada city on the map. \"The capital is 25 miles northeast. After Íllora's fall and Moclín's surrender—one bloody, one bloodless—Sultan Yusuf knows we're coming. If we march on Granada immediately with 15,000 men and five bombards, the psychological impact could be enormous. They've seen what our artillery did to Íllora in days. They know their field army is destroyed. The sight of our full force at their gates might break their will.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"But—and this is critical—if they don't surrender, we face the most heavily fortified city in Granada. Massive walls, large garrison, the Sultan himself commanding the defense. It could take months. And while we're besieging Granada, their fortresses remain intact behind us, potentially cutting our supply lines.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago leans forward. \"Alhama de Granada is different, Your Majesty. Smaller fortress, 25 miles southeast, controls the mountain passes between Granada and Málaga. Taking Alhama first isolates Granada from the coast and from any Moroccan reinforcements landing at Málaga. It's the strategic approach—weaken them systematically before the final blow.\"\n\n\nDon Fadrique adds: \"Alhama will be easier than Granada but harder than Moclín. Perhaps 400-600 garrison. Strong walls but nothing like the capital. With our bombards, we could take it in two to three weeks. Then we march on Granada with complete strategic superiority—they're isolated, demoralized, watching fortress after fortress fall.\"\n\n\nYour cousin Infante Juan speaks up: \"But if Granada might surrender when we appear—why delay? Every week gives Sultan Yusuf time to prepare defenses, gather supplies, receive reinforcements from Morocco. Speed has value, Your Majesty. Strike while they're reeling from Íllora and Moclín.\"\n\n\nOne of the cavalry commanders, Don Rodrigo de Perea, offers a different perspective: \"Your Majesty, respectfully—we don't know if Granada will surrender. It's their capital, their sacred city. They might fight to the last man. If we gamble on their surrender and they don't, we're committed to a massive siege without having secured our rear. That's dangerous.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro nods thoughtfully. \"Both approaches have merit. The bold stroke—march on Granada now, hope for surrender or quick victory. The methodical approach—take Alhama first, then Granada from position of total strength.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"Your Majesty, what does your instinct tell you? You've seen how they fight. You negotiated with Moclín's garrison—you heard their concerns about Sultan Yusuf's reaction to surrender. Do you believe Granada city will open its gates when we appear? Or will they fight?\"\n\n\nThe tent falls silent. The commanders await your judgment.\n\n\nWhat is your decision?"

The commanders should support this decision as sound strategy\n2. Need to organize the march - distance is 25 miles southeast from Íllora to Alhama\n3. Should cover logistics, route, timeline\n4. Keep response relatively short since this is a straightforward military decision\n5.

We secure Alhama first, isolate Granada completely, then finish this with overwhelming strength.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago adds: \"The methodical approach has served us well so far, Your Majesty. We don't gamble when we can win with certainty.\"\n\n\nDon Fadrique looks pleased. \"Alhama will fall quickly with our bombards, then Granada faces us with no hope of relief or supply. This is the right strategy.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro turns to the map, already planning. \"Alhama de Granada lies 25 miles southeast through mountain terrain. With 15,800 troops and five bombards, we'll need two days to march—April 19th and 20th. Arrive evening of the 20th, establish siege lines on the 21st.\"\n\n\nHe begins issuing orders to the gathered commanders:\n\n\n\"Master of Santiago—van guard with 3,000 men, cavalry screening our advance. Don Fadrique—main body with the infantry and artillery. Don Rodrigo—rearguard and supply train security. We march in three columns to move faster through the passes.\"\n\n\nThe commanders nod, already mentally organizing their units.\n\n\nÁlvaro continues: \"Alhama is strong but isolated. Garrison estimated at 400-600 men. Stone walls, elevated position, but nothing like Granada's fortifications. With systematic bombardment, we breach in two weeks, assault in three. By mid-May, Alhama falls. Then we march on Granada with complete strategic dominance.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you. \"Your Majesty, one question—do we send heralds to Alhama offering terms before we begin bombardment? After Íllora's cost and Moclín's peaceful surrender, some garrisons might be willing to negotiate if offered the chance. Or do we simply invest and begin the siege?\"\n\n\nThe tent waits for your decision on whether to offer terms first, or proceed directly to siege operations.\n\n\nWhat do you want to do?"

This is a CHAOS ROLL (Type 2) - it's about external factors like terrain, weather, enemy actions, accidents, etc. Not about Juan's persuasion or approach, but about what happens during the march and deployment.\n\nThis should have WIDE VARIANCE - genuine chance for things to go very well or very badly. Medieval marches through mountains with artillery are complex operations with many points of failure.\n\nFactors that could affect success:\n- Mountain terrain difficulty\n- Weather conditions\n- Guerrilla harassment from Granada forces\n- Artillery transport issues (bombards are heavy and unwieldy)\n- Supply train problems\n- Morale and discipline during march\n- Enemy preparedness at Alhama\n- Accidents, injuries, delays\n- Terrain around Alhama for bombard placement\n\nI should create outcomes ranging from catastrophic (major losses, bombards damaged, long delays) to spectacular (perfect march, ideal positions, enemy demoralized).\n\nLet me create a table with just main outcomes as requested:\n\n\nMARCH TO ALHAMA AND BOMBARD DEPLOYMENT - D100 CHAOS ROLL TABLE\n\n\n1-5: Catastrophic March\nMajor guerrilla ambush in mountain passes. 80-120 casualties. One bombard damaged beyond field repair, must be sent back. Arrival delayed 4-5 days. Enemy fully prepared.\n\n\n6-15: Severe Difficulties\nHeavy guerrilla harassment throughout march. 40-60 casualties. One bombard damaged, requires 3-4 days repairs. Supply train disrupted. Arrival delayed 2-3 days. Poor bombard positions available.\n\n\n16-25: Significant Problems\nConstant skirmishing and difficult terrain. 20-35 casualties. Artillery transport very slow through passes. Arrival delayed 1-2 days. Alhama garrison fully alert and prepared. Suboptimal bombard positions.\n\n\n26-40: Minor Complications\nSome guerrilla harassment and terrain challenges. 10-18 casualties. March takes full two days as planned but exhausting. Alhama aware of approach. Adequate but not ideal bombard positions require extra day to prepare.\n\n\n41-60: Standard March\nLight skirmishing, manageable terrain. 5-10 casualties from minor incidents. Arrive evening April 20th as planned. Alhama garrison alert but not panicked. Good bombard positions available within 300-350 yards of walls. Ready to offer terms April 21st.\n\n\n61-75: Smooth Operation\nMinimal resistance, good weather, efficient march. 2-5 casualties from accidents only. Arrive on schedule, troops in good condition. Excellent bombard positions found within 250-300 yards. Can offer terms morning of April 21st with artillery visibly deployed.\n\n\n76-85: Very Successful March\nFast movement, no significant resistance, excellent conditions. 0-2 casualties. Arrive evening April 20th with troops fresh. Perfect bombard positions within 200-250 yards. Alhama garrison visibly shaken by speed and force displayed.\n\n\n86-93: Exceptional Execution\nRapid march, complete surprise at speed, ideal conditions. No casualties. Arrive afternoon April 20th ahead of schedule. Perfect artillery positions within 200 yards. Garrison clearly frightened by professional deployment. Strong psychological advantage before negotiations.\n\n\n94-97: Outstanding Success\nLightning march through mountains, guerrillas avoided entirely, perfect weather. Arrive early April 20th, troops fresh and eager. Ideal bombard positions within 150-200 yards found immediately. Alhama garrison demoralized before siege begins—some already discussing surrender.\n\n\n98-100: Spectacular Achievement\nEverything perfect—fastest possible march, zero resistance, ideal conditions, troops arriving enthusiastic. Early afternoon April 20th arrival. Perfect positions within 150 yards of weakest wall section identified by scouts. Garrison visibly panicking at professional speed and deployment. Strong chance of immediate surrender when terms offered.\n\n\n\nRoll your d100 when ready."

The march itself - smooth, professional, rapid\n2. Arrival ahead of schedule\n3. The deployment of bombards in perfect positions\n4. The psychological impact on Alhama's garrison\n5. Setting up for Juan to offer terms\n\nKeep it relatively concise since this is mostly scene-setting before the next major interaction. Show the professionalism of the army, the excellent execution, and end with Juan ready to offer terms.\n\n\nTHE MARCH TO ALHAMA - APRIL 19-20, 1432\n\n\nThe army moves out at dawn on April 19th with the precision of a well-oiled machine. The Master of Santiago's vanguard clears the mountain passes ahead, cavalry scouts fanning out to screen against guerrilla attacks. The main column follows—15,800 men moving in disciplined formation through terrain that should slow them significantly.\n\n\nBut everything goes right.\n\n\nThe weather holds clear and mild. The scouts intercept two small guerrilla bands before they can organize attacks, scattering them with quick cavalry charges. The artillery crews have learned from previous marches—the bombards move smoothly on their reinforced carriages, the oxen teams coordinated perfectly. Supply wagons keep pace without incident.\n\n\nBy evening of the 19th, you've covered nearly 15 miles—excellent time through mountain passes. The army camps efficiently, sentries posted, no harassment during the night.\n\n\nThe morning of April 20th dawns clear. The march resumes with the same professional rhythm. Your cavalry screens report no significant enemy forces—only scattered scouts who flee rather than engage. The mountain passes seem almost empty, as if Granada's guerrilla forces have melted away or concentrated elsewhere.\n\n\nBy early afternoon—hours ahead of your planned schedule—the vanguard crests the final ridge and Alhama de Granada comes into view.\n\n\n\nALHAMA DE GRANADA - APRIL 20, 1432 (AFTERNOON)\n\n\nThe fortress town sits on elevated ground in a dramatic gorge, the Alhama River cutting through limestone cliffs below. Strong stone walls ring the town, with a castle keep on the highest point. It's imposing—but nothing like Granada city's massive fortifications.\n\n\nYour army deploys with practiced efficiency. The Master of Santiago's cavalry immediately secures the perimeter, cutting off escape routes. Infantry companies establish siege lines on three sides—the fourth side drops away into the gorge, impassable for assault.\n\n\nThen the artillery crews go to work.\n\n\nWithin two hours, they've identified perfect positions on the western approach—a slight rise approximately 180 yards from the walls, with clear fields of fire and solid ground for the bombard platforms. The crews begin constructing the firing positions with an efficiency born of multiple sieges. Earthworks go up to protect the guns. Ammunition is stockpiled. Elevation calculated precisely.\n\n\nBy late afternoon, all five bombards are in position, their massive bronze barrels aimed at the western wall. The deployment is textbook-perfect—any military engineer would be impressed.\n\n\n\nTHE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT\n\n\nFrom your command position, you can see movement on Alhama's walls. Garrison soldiers staring at the army that appeared hours earlier than they expected, at the bombards deployed with frightening efficiency. You can imagine the conversations happening inside—did they hear about Íllora? How the walls fell in days? How 87 Castilians died taking it because the commander refused terms?\n\n\nDid they hear about Moclín? How the garrison negotiated and surrendered without a shot fired?\n\n\nÁlvaro rides up beside you, satisfaction evident on his face. \"Your Majesty, this is how it should be done. We're in position a full day ahead of schedule. The men are fresh, not exhausted. The artillery is perfectly placed. And look—\" He points at the walls. \"They're frightened. They didn't expect this speed or this professionalism.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago joins you. \"Your Majesty, we're ready. The siege lines are secure. No one gets in or out without our knowledge. When you're ready to offer terms, we can arrange it immediately.\"\n\n\nThe sun is lowering toward the western mountains, casting long shadows across the siege lines. Your army of nearly 16,000 men camps in perfect order around Alhama. The five bombards sit ready, their crews standing by for orders.\n\n\nThe fortress waits. You can see figures on the walls watching your camp, watching the artillery, calculating their chances.\n\n\nÁlvaro asks quietly: \"Your Majesty, do you offer terms now, this evening? Or wait until morning so they have the night to contemplate what's coming?\"\n\n\nWhat do you want to do?"

I need to analyze the success and failure factors, then create a custom table where both factors persist across all roll levels, but their manifestation changes based on how well Juan's approach lands.\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n- Juan came in person in white armor (shows courage and honor)\n- Army arrived exceptionally fast and deployed perfectly (demonstrates overwhelming capability)\n- Five bombards positioned perfectly at 180 yards (they can see the artillery that broke Íllora)\n- Juan's reputation for keeping his word (Íllora prisoners treated fairly despite refusal, Moclín negotiated successfully)\n- Military reality is overwhelming - 16,000 men vs likely 400-600 garrison\n- Recent examples: Íllora fell in days to these same bombards, Moclín surrendered peacefully\n- Offering terms BEFORE bombardment (shows mercy, unlike just attacking)\n- Juan's personal presence and respectful approach\n- Clear escape from death if they negotiate\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n- Íllora example is double-edged: yes he kept his word, but terms got HARDER after refusal (garrison captured, not just allowed to leave)\n- Professional military honor - surrendering before even being attacked\n- Sultan Yusuf might punish families in Granada for \"cowardice\"\n- Fear of what \"Christian rule\" actually means (mosques, law, property)\n- 700 years of Christian-Muslim conflict creates deep distrust\n- Some commanders might be hardliners who refuse negotiation on principle\n- Fear that negotiating shows weakness and emboldens Christians further\n- Possible internal division in garrison between pragmatists and hardliners\n- Granada city might send reinforcements or orders to hold at all costs\n- Religious duty to defend Muslim territory\n\nNow I need to create a table where these factors persist but manifest differently based on roll:\n- Low rolls: Failure factors dominate, success factors acknowledged but don't persuade\n- Mid rolls: Mixed, genuine negotiation needed\n\n\n- High rolls: Success factors resonate strongly, failure factors raised constructively\n\nAt the highest roll levels, Juan's strategic advantages become compelling. The garrison sees beyond immediate fears, recognizing the pragmatic path of survival and potential honorable terms. His reputation for mercy transforms from a distant promise to a tangible lifeline, with military realities becoming an undeniable backdrop to their decision-making process.\n\n\nALHAMA INITIAL RESPONSE TO TERMS OFFER - D100 PERSUASION ROLL TABLE\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS\n\n\nJuan came personally in white armor, army arrived exceptionally fast with perfect deployment, five bombards visibly positioned at 180 yards, reputation for keeping word demonstrated at Íllora and Moclín, overwhelming military superiority (16,000 vs ~400-600), offering terms before bombardment shows mercy\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS\n\n\nÍllora precedent cuts both ways (terms got harder after refusal), professional honor demands fighting before surrender, fear of Sultan's punishment for \"cowardice,\" distrust of Christian rule conditions, 700 years of conflict, possible hardliner commanders, religious duty to defend Muslim land\n\n\n\n1-15: HOSTILE REJECTION\nNo response from walls for long minutes. Then arrows—deliberate shots landing near (not at) Juan as warning. Shouted rejection in Arabic: garrison united in refusal, hardline commander in control. Juan's demonstrated honor acknowledged but Íllora's harsher terms after refusal dominates their thinking. Fear of appearing cowardly outweighs military reality. Gates stay shut, defiance clear.\n\n\n16-30: DEFIANT SILENCE\nLong silence from walls. Finally single officer appears briefly: \"We hear you, King of Castile. We must consult.\" Then disappears. No further response this evening. Clear internal division—some want to negotiate, others refuse. Hardliners currently winning argument. Juan's show of force noted but not yet decisive. Military reality exists but pride/fear preventing engagement.\n\n\n31-45: CAUTIOUS INQUIRY\nAfter tense wait, senior officer appears on wall with interpreters. Asks questions from distance: \"What terms exactly? What happened at Íllora and Moclín? What does Christian rule mean?\" Not committing to negotiate, just gathering information. Internal debate clearly happening. Juan's reputation and military display acknowledged but deep concerns remain. Need convincing, not just intimidation.\n\n\n46-60: SERIOUS CONSIDERATION\nGates remain closed but communication opens. Officer appears: \"King Juan, your reputation precedes you. Your army's arrival was... impressive. We see the bombards that broke Íllora.\" Asks for time to discuss among garrison leadership: \"Return tomorrow morning. We will have answer—either we negotiate seriously or we prepare to defend. But we will not decide tonight.\" Professional tone, treating Juan with respect while buying time to debate internally.\n\n\n61-75: WILLING TO NEGOTIATE\nAfter brief wait, garrison commander appears on wall—middle-aged, professional bearing. \"Your Majesty, you honor us by coming personally. We saw your army arrive today with speed we did not expect. We know what your bombards did to Íllora.\" Clear respect in tone. \"We are willing to discuss terms. Not surrender—discuss. What exactly do you offer? We need specifics before opening gates.\" Ready to negotiate but want details first.\n\n\n76-85: EAGER FOR TERMS\nCommander appears quickly with several officers. \"Your Majesty! We saw your army deploy. Those are the bombards from Íllora, yes? And you negotiated with Moclín—they surrendered without fighting?\" Visible relief that terms are being offered. \"We are professionals, not fanatics. We understand military reality. Please—tell us your terms. If they are fair like Moclín, we can discuss seriously. We do not wish to die for nothing.\"\n\n\n86-93: READY TO SURRENDER\nGates open partially within minutes. Commander and officers emerge under flag of truce, approaching respectfully. \"Your Majesty, forgive our quick response—but we recognize reality. Sixteen thousand men, five bombards, perfect deployment. You are the king who kept his word at Íllora despite their refusal, who negotiated peace at Moclín.\" Deep bow. \"We wish to hear your terms. If they are fair, we can surrender with honor. Why die when life with dignity is offered?\"\n\n\n94-97: IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE\nCommander appears on wall almost immediately: \"Your Majesty! King Juan! We surrender Alhama!\" Visible emotion. \"We heard of Íllora—how you offered mercy before assault. We heard of Moclín—how you negotiated fairly and garrison lives. Your army arrived like lightning today. Your reputation is true.\" Gates begin opening. \"Please, Your Majesty—we wish to discuss formal terms tonight. We accept surrender. We only ask honorable treatment as Moclín received. No more blood needs spilling.\"\n\n\n98-100: ENTHUSIASTIC CAPITULATION\nGates swing open fully within five minutes. Commander and entire officer corps emerge, some with visible relief, others with awe. Commander approaches and kneels: \"Your Majesty, we surrender Alhama completely. Now. Tonight. Your arrival today showed us what we face. Your reputation shows us what mercy exists. Why die defending walls that will fall in days?\" Officers nodding agreement. \"We only ask—the terms you gave Moclín? Safe conduct or stay with protection? We accept immediately. You have won not just with swords but with honor. Let us write surrender tonight.\"\n\n\n\nRoll your d100 when ready."

They're asking questions from a distance, gathering information, clearly debating internally. Juan's reputation and military display are acknowledged but there are deep concerns.\n\nKey elements to include:\n- Officer appears on wall with interpreters\n- Asks questions from distance (not coming out yet)\n- Questions about what happened at Íllora and Moclín\n- What exactly are the terms?\n- What does Christian rule mean?\n- Not committing to negotiate yet, just gathering information\n- Internal debate clearly happening\n- Juan's reputation acknowledged but concerns remain\n- They need convincing, not just intimidation\n\nI need to stop when Juan needs to respond to their questions. Never generate dialogue or actions for Juan.\n\n\nThe walls of Alhama remain silent for long, tense minutes. Your white armor catches the late afternoon sun as you sit motionless on your horse before the main gate, your banner stirring in the mountain breeze. Behind you at a respectful distance, your escort waits.\n\n\nFinally, movement on the wall. A figure appears—a senior officer in ornate armor, flanked by two others. One appears to be an interpreter. They position themselves carefully, staying well back from the wall's edge, clearly cautious.\n\n\nThe officer calls down in Arabic, which the interpreter translates into Castilian: \"We hear you, King of Castile. Your reputation has reached us. Your army's arrival today was... faster than expected.\"\n\n\nA pause, then more questions come rapid-fire, the officer's tone wary but not hostile:\n\n\n\"What happened at Íllora? We heard there was a siege, that many died. Is this true? And Moclín—did they truly surrender without fighting, or is this Christian propaganda?\"\n\n\nAnother officer leans forward to add his own question through the interpreter: \"What are your terms exactly, King Juan? You say 'fair terms'—but what does this mean? What happened to the Íllora garrison? Are they alive or dead?\"\n\n\nThe first officer continues: \"And what does 'Christian rule' mean for Muslims who stay? We have heard promises before from Christian kings. Words are easy, Your Majesty. What guarantees can you offer?\"\n\n\nBehind them on the wall, you can see other garrison members gathering—clearly word has spread that the Christian king himself is at the gate. You can hear muffled arguments in Arabic, though the words are unclear at this distance.\n\n\nThe senior officer calls down again: \"Your Majesty, we must understand what we are considering before we can discuss further. Answer these questions truthfully, and we will listen.\"\n\n\nThey wait on the wall, clearly not coming down to negotiate face-to-face yet, but not shutting the conversation down either. They're gathering information while heated debate continues behind them.\n\n\nYour escort remains at a distance, waiting. The garrison waits for your answers.\n\n\nWhat do you tell them?"

Then: \"Your Majesty, we respect the flag of truce, but we will speak from here. Answer our questions first. If your terms are truly fair, you can explain them from where you stand.

The senior officer emerges with three others, leaving weapons visible but not drawn. They approach to about thirty yards, stopping respectfully. \"Your Majesty, you honor the traditions of war by coming personally under flag of truce. We honor them by meeting you.

The garrison is not refusing outright, but they're being very cautious. They want Juan to answer their questions from where he stands first, before they commit to coming down. They're testing his willingness to engage on their terms.\n\nThis makes sense - they're being prudent military professionals. They saw his army arrive with shocking speed and perfect deployment, but they're not ready to just trust him yet. They want information first.\n\nI should narrate this clearly, show their caution, but also show that the door is still open. They're engaged, just careful. Juan will need to decide whether to answer their questions from this position or push harder for face-to-face meeting.\n\nI must NEVER write what Juan says or does - I need to stop and let the player decide how to respond.\n\n\nOn the walls, an intense discussion breaks out among the officers. You can see gestures, heated words in Arabic, clear disagreement. The senior officer keeps glancing down at you, then back at his companions. The debate goes on for several minutes—long enough that the sun drops another degree toward the mountains, the shadows lengthening.\n\n\nFinally, the senior officer returns to the wall's edge. The interpreter translates his words:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, your gesture is noted with respect. To dismount alone before our gates shows courage.\" A pause, then: \"But you must understand our position. We do not know you personally—only what we have heard. Stories travel, but stories can be... shaped.\"\n\n\nAnother officer leans in, speaking urgently to the first, who nods and continues: \"We cannot come down to negotiate before we understand what we would be negotiating. This is not disrespect to the flag of truce—we honor it absolutely. But prudence demands we know what happened at Íllora and Moclín before we commit to formal parley.\"\n\n\nThe interpreter adds the officer's final words: \"Your Majesty, if you answer our questions truthfully from where you stand—about Íllora's siege, about what happened to their garrison, about Moclín's surrender, about what 'Christian rule' means for those who stay—then we will know your character by your answers. If your words match your reputation for honor, then we will come down to meet you face to face and discuss terms properly.\"\n\n\nBehind them, you can see the internal division clearly now—some officers are nodding in agreement with this approach, while others look frustrated, clearly wanting to come down immediately. But the senior officer has made the decision for now.\n\n\n\"Please, Your Majesty,\" the interpreter calls. \"Answer these questions. Show us that the stories we heard are true. Then we can meet as you request.\"\n\n\nYour escort remains at their respectful distance. The garrison waits for your response—will you answer their questions from this position, or insist they come down first to negotiate properly?\n\n\nWhat do you do?"

So no Íllora garrison members are with the army.\n\n2. From Moclín - About 180 chose safe conduct to Granada, 170 chose to stay. But Juan left them in Moclín with the garrison - they didn't join his army.\n\n3. There might be some Moorish civilians who have been following the army as merchants, guides, or servants from conquered territories.\n\n4. More realistically - there might be some mudéjares (Muslims living under Christian rule in Castile) who serve as translators, guides, or auxiliaries with the army.\n\n5. There could be Christian officers who were present at the negotiations at Moclín and could testify to what happened.\n\nLet me have Juan's escort respond realistically.\n\n\nYou turn to your escort and call the question. Your cavalry captain, Don Pedro, rides forward and confers briefly with the other officers.\n\n\nHe returns and speaks quietly: \"Your Majesty, we have no Moorish soldiers with us.

They've been with us since Toledo. One is a respected merchant named Ibrahim who has traded in Granada before. He could speak to your character, though I don't know if the garrison would trust a mudéjar serving Christian forces.\"\n\n\nDon Pedro glances back toward the army camp. \"And Your Majesty, there are the Christian officers who were present at Moclín's surrender—Infante Juan, several captains who witnessed the negotiations, the friars who signed the agreement. They could testify to what happened there.\"\n\n\nHe looks thoughtful. \"Or Your Majesty could simply answer their questions directly. You were there. You know what happened. Your word as king should carry weight—and if they don't trust it, no intermediary will convince them.\"\n\n\nThe garrison officers are still watching from the wall, waiting to see what you do.\n\n\nWhat do you want to do?"

Muslims who surrendered at Málaga and joined service\n\nLet me search for this information.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Reconciled historical conversions with current military composition.\n\nThe user is correct - there were significant conversions after Alcalá, and some of those converted Muslims would have joined the crusade army. Specifically:\n\n1. After Alcalá la Real: 70-140 Muslim soldiers from the garrison chose to convert to Christianity, led by Commander Yusuf ibn Rashid (who became Martín) and his son Ibrahim. These men underwent religious instruction and then joined the crusade army.\n\n2. Ahmad al-Zarqali, the qadi who converted, traveled to Rome but then would have returned or been with the court.\n\n3. At Málaga (western campaign), there would have been some who surrendered and potentially joined service.\n\nSo yes, there absolutely would be former Granada Muslim soldiers who converted and are now serving in Juan's army. Let me correct this.\n\n\nDon Pedro pauses, then his face clears with realization. \"Your Majesty, forgive me—of course. The converts from Alcalá. Commander Martín's men.\"\n\n\nHe turns in his saddle and calls back toward the main camp: \"Send word for Commander Martín de Alcalá and some of his officers!\"\n\n\nWhile waiting, Don Pedro explains: \"Your Majesty, Commander Martín—formerly Yusuf ibn Rashid—and approximately eighty of his converted men are with the main army. They've been serving as scouts and guides since they completed their instruction last year. They know Granada's fortresses, the commanders, the tactics. Several were born in these mountains.\"\n\n\nWithin minutes, three riders approach from the camp—Muslim men in Castilian colors, wearing crosses alongside their armor. The lead rider dismounts and bows deeply. He's perhaps fifty years old, weathered and professional.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says in accented Castilian. \"I am Martín de Alcalá, formerly Yusuf ibn Rashid. You called for us?\"\n\n\nBehind him, two younger officers—one you recognize might be his son Ibrahim, now bearing a Christian name as well.\n\n\nMartín looks up at the walls of Alhama, then back to you. \"Your Majesty, those men on the walls—some may know me.

This is a very smart move - having Muslim witnesses who served Granada and converted will be more credible than Christian officers.\n\nJuan asks Martín to be truthful and honest. This is important - Juan is trusting him to tell the truth, even if it's complicated.\n\nThen Juan brings them to the walls and lets Martín talk.\n\nI need to:\n1. Show Martín's response to Juan's request\n2. Have Juan and Martín approach the walls\n3. Show the garrison's reaction to seeing Martín\n4. Let Martín speak and answer their questions\n5. This will be a persuasion roll situation eventually, but first I should narrate the conversation\n\nI should NOT generate dialogue for Juan. I should let Martín speak, show the garrison's questions, and see how the conversation develops. Then probably need another roll to see if this testimony convinces them to come down and negotiate.\n\nLet me write this scene carefully, stopping when Juan needs to act or respond.\n\n\nMartín's weathered face grows solemn. He places his hand over his heart—an old gesture from his Muslim days that he still carries. \"Your Majesty, I will speak only truth. These men deserve that, as I deserved truth when I stood where they stand now.\"\n\n\nYou ride back toward the walls with Martín and his two officers. As you approach, the garrison officers lean forward, staring intently at the men in Castilian colors.\n\n\nOne of them suddenly calls out in Arabic—sharp, disbelieving. The interpreter translates: \"Yusuf ibn Rashid? Commander of Alcalá?\"\n\n\nMartín stops perhaps forty yards from the gate. He calls back in Arabic, his voice carrying clearly in the mountain air. Then he switches to Castilian for your benefit and the garrison's interpreter:\n\n\n\"I am Martín de Alcalá now. But yes—I was Yusuf ibn Rashid. I commanded Alcalá la Real for sixteen years. I fought in twenty-three battles for Granada. I served Sultan Muhammad IX and Sultan Yusuf IV. Some of you may know my name.\"\n\n\nOn the walls, intense discussion breaks out. Several officers are clearly recognizing him—gesturing, arguing, shocked.\n\n\nThe senior officer who spoke earlier calls down: \"You... you converted? YOU? Yusuf ibn Rashid, who held five fortresses, who fought Christians for thirty-two years?\"\n\n\nMartín's voice is steady but carries deep emotion: \"I did. After what I witnessed at Alcalá on April 1st last year. After I watched from my walls as Sultan Yusuf's jihad army—sixteen thousand faithful men who had prayed and prepared and believed—was destroyed in a single afternoon.\"\n\n\nSilence from the walls. Every garrison member is listening now.\n\n\nMartín continues: \"I am here because King Juan asked me to speak truth to you. To answer your questions about what happened at Íllora, at Moclín, about what it means to live under his rule. Ask me anything. I will answer honestly—even if the answer is difficult, even if it makes you doubt me. You deserve truth, not persuasion.\"\n\n\nThe younger officer on the wall—the one who had been asking questions earlier—calls down, his voice shaking: \"What happened at Íllora? We heard... we heard there was great slaughter.\"\n\n\nMartín nods grimly. \"There was. Eighty-seven Castilian soldiers died. Approximately two hundred Muslim soldiers died. Civilians died when a wall collapsed during the bombardment.\" He pauses. \"But this happened because Commander Qaid Hamza refused to negotiate. King Juan came to Íllora's gates personally, just as he came to yours today, and offered terms. Hamza refused. Three days later, when the walls had been breached and assault was imminent, Hamza's own officers mutinied against him. They surrendered the fortress rather than see everyone die for one man's pride.\"\n\n\nThe senior officer asks: \"And what happened to those who surrendered? The garrison? The civilians?\"\n\n\n\"The garrison—three hundred eighty-five men—are imprisoned at Antequera. They will be released when Granada city and the major fortresses fall. King Juan gave his word. The civilians were protected. Their property was protected. No forced conversions. I have spoken with men who were there. The king kept his word, even though Hamza's refusal cost Christian blood.\"\n\n\nAnother voice from the walls: \"And Moclín? What happened there?\"\n\n\nOne of Martín's officers—his son Ibrahim, now called Felipe—speaks up: \"Moclín negotiated. Commander Rahman al-Zagal was wise. He and his officers came down from the walls and discussed terms with King Juan. They reached agreement. Written terms, witnessed by friars who stayed to enforce them. The garrison chose—some left for Granada with honor, others stayed with protection. No blood was spilled. Not one man died.\"\n\n\nThe senior officer's voice is strained: \"But you converted, Yusuf—Martín. You and your men. Why? Were you forced?\"\n\n\nMartín shakes his head. \"No. Never forced. After I witnessed the battle at Alcalá, after I saw what I saw, I had questions I could not answer. Why would Allah let the faithful be destroyed so completely? Why would He abandon those who fought in His name? I spoke with my officers. Seventy of us felt the same doubt, the same questions. We asked to convert—not from fear, not from coercion, but because we could not explain what we witnessed except that perhaps... perhaps we had been wrong about which God favored us.\"\n\n\nHis voice grows quieter but more intense: \"For a year now, I have lived under Christian rule. I have served in this army. I have seen how King Juan keeps his word—at Íllora despite their refusal, at Moclín with written guarantees. I have seen Muslims living under Christian law with their faith protected, their families safe. It is not perfect. The main mosques become churches—that is hard. We are minorities now—that is bitter. But we live. We practice our faith. We are treated with dignity.\"\n\n\nThe garrison is completely silent now, absorbing his words.\n\n\nMartín concludes: \"You asked about Christian rule. I can tell you what it truly means, because I live it every day. Ask me anything else. I owe you truth.\"\n\n\nThe senior officer and his companions confer intensely on the walls. Finally, he calls down: \"If we come down to speak with King Juan face to face—to negotiate properly as Moclín did—what guarantee do we have? How do we know we won't be taken hostage the moment we leave these walls?\"\n\n\nMartín looks at you, waiting to see how you will answer this question.\n\n\nWhat do you say?"

Let me analyze the success and failure factors:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n- Martín's testimony is extremely powerful - a legendary Granada commander who converted and serves Juan\n- Martín spoke honestly about both successes (Moclín) and costs (Íllora)\n- Juan pointing out the tactical reality - the garrison HAS the advantage (archers on walls)\n- Officers can keep weapons, come with guards\n- Juan's repeated demonstrations of honor through Martín's testimony\n- Logical argument that capturing them would be impossible/suicidal\n- Simple, direct appeal to honor and reason\n- Martín and other Muslims present as living proof of fair treatment\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n- Still fear of deception/trap\n- Historical distrust of Christians\n- Professional caution\n- Internal division in garrison (some hardliners)\n- Coming down is psychologically committing to negotiation\n- Fear of appearing weak/cowardly\n- Martín is a convert - some might see him as traitor not witness\n\nThis is a persuasion roll, not chaos. The factors persist across outcomes. On low rolls, the failure factors dominate but success factors still exist. On high rolls, success factors resonate but concerns remain.\n\nGiven that Martín just gave powerful testimony and Juan made a logical, honorable appeal, this should lean positive but not guaranteed.\n\n\nALHAMA OFFICERS COMING DOWN - D100 PERSUASION ROLL TABLE\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS\n\n\nMartín's powerful testimony from legendary Granada commander, honest account of both Íllora's cost and Moclín's peace, tactical reality favors garrison (archers on walls), officers can keep weapons and guards, Juan's demonstrated honor proven by Martín's service, logical impossibility of capture, simple direct appeal to honor\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS\n\n\nFear of deception despite logic, 700 years of Christian-Muslim distrust, professional military caution, possible hardliner faction, coming down psychologically commits to negotiation, appearing weak before garrison, some may view Martín as traitor not witness\n\n\n\n1-10: STUBBORN REFUSAL\nLong silence. Then: \"Your Majesty's logic is sound. Commander Martín's testimony moves us. But we cannot.\" The officer's voice is pained. \"Not because we doubt your word—but because coming down commits us to a path half our garrison opposes. There are men behind us who say negotiating at all is betrayal. If we come down, we risk mutiny from hardliners who want to fight regardless. We need time to convince our own men first. Return tomorrow morning. Perhaps by then...\" Martín's testimony registered but internal division prevents action. The military reality and Juan's honor acknowledged, but garrison politics paralyze them.\n\n\n11-25: CAUTIOUS DELAY\nThe senior officer confers with companions, clearly torn. \"Your Majesty, Commander Martín's words carry weight. What he described at Íllora and Moclín—we hear truth in it. And your tactical point is valid—we do have advantage of walls.\" But hesitation: \"Yet we ask for time. Not to be difficult, but to discuss among ourselves what we heard. Martín spoke of seventy men choosing conversion after witnessing battle. We have witnessed nothing yet—only heard accounts. Let us deliberate tonight. If you return at dawn, we will either come down to negotiate as you ask, or give you clear answer we choose to defend.\" They're seriously considering but not ready to commit immediately. Martín's testimony working but needs time to overcome caution.\n\n\n26-45: INTERNAL DEBATE VISIBLE\nHeated argument breaks out on walls—some officers clearly want to come down, others resistant. The senior officer turns back: \"Your Majesty, Commander Martín, forgive us—we are having urgent discussion.\" After several minutes: \"Some of us are convinced by what we heard. Commander Martín's testimony especially—he knew our world, he fought as we fight, he made his choice for reasons we understand. And Your Majesty's tactical point is fair—you cannot capture us from below.\" But concerns remain: \"However, some captains fear this is still somehow deception. Others worry about appearing weak. Can you grant us one hour? Let us settle this among ourselves. Then either we come down, or we answer definitively we will not.\" Progress made but final decision still contested internally.\n\n\n46-65: RELUCTANT ACCEPTANCE\nExtended conference on walls. Martín's testimony clearly impacting them—you hear his name repeatedly in their Arabic discussions. Finally the senior officer returns: \"Your Majesty, Commander Martín, you make compelling arguments. Martín—you were legend among Granada's commanders. That you serve this king and speak well of him... this carries great weight.\" He glances back at his men, seeing reluctant nods. \"And Your Majesty's tactical point is sound. We have the walls, the archers. You cannot take us hostage even if you wished.\" Deep breath: \"We will come down. Six of us—myself and five officers. We keep our weapons as you suggest. We speak between your position and the gate. This is prudent but also shows respect for the parley you request.\" Gates begin opening slowly. \"Commander Martín, your testimony convinced us to take this chance. We pray it is wisdom, not folly.\"\n\n\n66-80: RESPECTFUL AGREEMENT\nBrief intense discussion, then clear decision. Gates open and the senior officer emerges with five others, all armed but bearing white flag. They approach to twenty yards and stop respectfully. \"Your Majesty, Commander Martín, you have convinced us. Martín—I remember hearing of Yusuf ibn Rashid when I was young officer. Sixteen years commanding Alcalá, they said. If such a man serves King Juan and speaks well of him, this testimony cannot be dismissed.\" He bows slightly. \"And Your Majesty's point about the tactical situation is fair—we have every advantage of position. You show honor by coming yourself. We show honor by meeting you. Let us discuss terms as soldiers, not as men shouting across walls. Commander Martín—we are grateful you spoke honestly about both victories and costs. That honesty makes us trust this conversation more, not less.\"\n\n\n81-92: EAGER RESPONSE\nDiscussion on walls is brief—Martín's testimony clearly decisive. Gates open quickly and commander emerges with full officer staff, approaching directly. \"Your Majesty, Commander Martín, you have convinced us completely.\" He addresses Martín first: \"Commander, your reputation reached even here. When you say King Juan keeps his word, when you describe life under Christian rule honestly—the difficulties and the protections—this carries more weight than any Christian testimony could.\" Then to Juan: \"And Your Majesty, your tactical point is well-taken. We would be fools to fear capture when we hold the walls above you. You show great honor by coming personally. Commander Martín shows great honor by speaking truth even when difficult. We will hear your terms. If they are as fair as Moclín received, we are prepared to surrender without more blood.\"\n\n\n93-100: IMMEDIATE CAPITULATION\nThe gates swing open almost immediately. The entire garrison leadership emerges—commander, all senior officers, even some regular soldiers. The commander approaches and actually kneels briefly in respect. \"Your Majesty, Commander Martín, we surrender Alhama. Now. Tonight.\" Emotion in his voice: \"Commander Martín—Yusuf ibn Rashid, as we knew you—your testimony decides this. You were legend. You served Granada with honor for thirty-two years. If you say King Juan keeps his word, if you serve him willingly after witnessing what you witnessed, then we trust this.\" He stands: \"We saw your army arrive today like lightning. Perfect deployment, professional beyond our hopes to resist. Then you came personally to offer terms. Then you brought Commander Martín to speak truth. What more proof do we need? We accept surrender on the terms Moclín received. Let us write agreement tonight. No blood needs to be spilled. You have won not just militarily but through demonstrated honor.\"\n\n\n\nRoll your d100 when ready."

I should narrate Juan's respectful withdrawal, the camp settling for the night, and then explain that no letters have arrived yet because it's too soon.\n\nI should also set up the night at camp and the anticipation of tomorrow's dawn meeting.\n\n\nYou bow respectfully, your white armor catching the last rays of sunset. \"Granted. I fully understand and respect your position. I will return tomorrow at dawn and pray for wisdom on both our parts in the meantime. Until then.\"\n\n\nThe senior officer bows in return, clearly relieved at your reasonableness. \"Thank you, Your Majesty. We will have our answer at dawn.\"\n\n\nYou turn and ride back to your lines with Martín and his officers. Behind you, the gates of Alhama close, and you can hear the muffled sounds of intense discussion continuing within.\n\n\n\nTHE CAMP - EVENING OF APRIL 20, 1432\n\n\nBack at the command tent, Álvaro is waiting with the senior commanders. \"Your Majesty? What happened?\"\n\n\nYou explain the afternoon's events—the initial cautious response, bringing Martín forward, his powerful testimony, the garrison's request for time to deliberate.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods thoughtfully. \"Wise to grant them the night. Martín's testimony clearly shook them—forcing an immediate decision might have pushed them toward refusal out of pride. This way, the reasonable officers have time to convince the resisters.\"\n\n\nMartín speaks up: \"Your Majesty, with your permission, I'll remain near the command tent tonight. If you need me at dawn, I'll be ready.\"\n\n\nYou grant permission, and the camp settles into evening routine. Sentries are posted, watch rotations established. The siege lines remain in place but relaxed—no sense of imminent combat. The men settle around campfires, talking quietly about what tomorrow might bring.\n\n\n\nTHE LETTERS\n\n\nAs you enter your command tent, you ask about correspondence from Toledo.\n\n\nYour secretary shakes his head. \"Your Majesty, no letters yet. The messengers departed only two days ago on the 18th. Even riding hard, they won't reach Toledo until the 22nd or 23rd at earliest—it's nearly 200 miles through difficult terrain. Then replies must be written and messengers must return. Realistically, Your Majesty, we won't see responses until late April at the earliest, possibly early May.\"\n\n\nHe's right, of course. You sent those letters just two days ago. Isabel doesn't even know you've left Íllora yet, let alone arrived at Alhama.\n\n\nThe night settles over the siege camp. From your tent, you can see the walls of Alhama silhouetted against the darkening sky. Torches move along the battlements—the garrison is clearly still awake, still debating.\n\n\nÁlvaro enters with evening reports: \"Your Majesty, the camp is secure. No signs of enemy activity beyond the fortress. The men are in good spirits—they heard about your parley, about Commander Martín's testimony. They're hopeful this might end like Moclín rather than Íllora.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Tomorrow at dawn, you return to the gates. Either they come down to negotiate, or we begin systematic siege operations. The bombards are ready either way.\"\n\n\nThe mountain night is cold and clear. Stars emerge overhead. Somewhere on those walls, garrison officers are making the decision that will determine whether hundreds of men live or die in the coming weeks.\n\n\nWhat do you do for the evening? Do you wish to speak with anyone, pray, make preparations, or simply rest before tomorrow's crucial meeting?"

The success and failure factors persist - they don't change based on the roll, but how they play out in the garrison's decision does.\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (that exist regardless of roll):\n- Martín's powerful testimony from legendary commander\n- Military reality overwhelming (16,000 vs 350, perfect bombard deployment)\n- Juan's demonstrated honor at both Íllora and Moclín\n- Tactical safety of negotiation (they keep walls/weapons/archers)\n- Professional soldier pragmatism vs dying for nothing\n- Night to deliberate let reasonable voices work on resisters\n- Juan showed respect by granting time rather than forcing decision\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (that exist regardless of roll):\n- Professional military honor demands some resistance before surrender\n- Fear of Sultan's punishment for \"cowardly\" surrender\n- Religious duty to defend Muslim land\n- Distrust despite evidence (700 years of conflict)\n- Some hardliners may refuse to accept any surrender\n- Coming down still psychologically difficult\n- Possible mutiny from garrison hardliners if commanders negotiate\n\nThe roll determines HOW these factors play out in their final decision, not WHETHER the factors exist.\n\n\nALHAMA FINAL DECISION AFTER NIGHT OF DELIBERATION - D100 PERSUASION ROLL\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (Persist at all roll levels)\n\n\nMartín's legendary testimony, overwhelming military reality, Juan's demonstrated honor, tactical safety of negotiation, professional pragmatism, night allowed reasonable officers to convince resisters, Juan's respect in granting time\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (Persist at all roll levels)\n\n\nMilitary honor demands resistance, fear of Sultan's punishment, religious duty, deep historical distrust, possible hardliner faction, psychological difficulty of surrender, risk of internal mutiny\n\n\n\n1-15: DEFIANT REJECTION - Hardliners Won\nGates remain closed. Long wait, then senior officer appears looking strained. \"Your Majesty, Commander Martín—we debated all night. Your testimony moved many of us. But...\" His voice hardens with resignation. \"We cannot agree. Too many officers say negotiating without fighting shames us. That Sultan Yusuf will punish our families in Granada if we surrender without resistance. That religious duty demands we defend this land.\" Behind him, you see hardline officers standing firm, arms crossed. \"Commander Martín, we respect what you witnessed. But we did not witness it. Your Majesty, you offered honorably. We reject honorably. We will defend Alhama. May God judge which of us is right.\" The reasonable faction lost the internal debate. Siege must proceed.\n\n\n16-30: PAINFUL REFUSAL - Fear Wins Over Logic\nAfter tense wait, commander appears with officers—visible division among them. \"Your Majesty, we spent the night in difficult discussion. Commander Martín's testimony convinced many. The military reality is clear. Your honor seems genuine.\" But his face shows pain: \"Yet we cannot come down. Half my officers fear Sultan Yusuf's reaction—that he will call us cowards, punish our families in Granada for surrendering without fighting. Others say religious duty demands resistance even against overwhelming odds.\" He glances back at his men—some nodding, others looking frustrated. \"Commander Martín, you speak of witnessing something that changed everything. We have witnessed only your words, however powerful. We need... we need to resist, at least some, before we can surrender with honor intact. Your Majesty, we reject your terms. We will defend.\" Logic acknowledged but fear and duty override it.\n\n\n31-50: CONDITIONAL WILLINGNESS - Need Face-Saving Resistance\nCommander appears with several officers, face troubled. \"Your Majesty, Commander Martín—your words worked on us through the night. Many of us are convinced. The military reality you describe is overwhelming. Commander Martín's service proves your honor.\" But then carefully: \"Yet we face a problem. If we surrender now, before any fighting, Sultan Yusuf will call us traitors. Our families in Granada will suffer. We will be remembered as cowards who gave up a strong fortress without testing the enemy.\" He pauses, choosing words carefully. \"Could we... could we resist for some days? Allow you to bombard us, to show we fought? Then negotiate surrender after we have demonstrated honor through resistance? This would let us surrender with dignity intact, protecting our families from accusations of cowardice.\" They want to negotiate but need face-saving combat first. Offering compromise: token resistance, then surrender.\n\n\n51-70: DIVIDED GARRISON - Partial Surrender Offer\nGates open partially. Commander emerges with half his officers—others visibly remaining on walls, refusing. \"Your Majesty, we have split. Commander Martín's testimony and your demonstrated honor convinced many of us. Approximately one hundred eighty men wish to surrender now, immediately, accepting your terms.\" But pain in his voice: \"The others—about one hundred seventy men—refuse. They say surrendering without fighting shames them. They will defend the fortress.\" He meets your eyes directly: \"Your Majesty, we offer this: let those of us who wish to surrender depart now with safe conduct to Granada, or stay with protections. The resisters will defend. You can then take the fortress by siege with smaller garrison. Less bloodshed than full garrison fighting.\" Internal debate created split decision—reasonable faction wants out, hardliners will fight. Unusual situation requiring Juan's response.\n\n\n71-85: READY TO NEGOTIATE - Need Final Assurances\nAfter brief wait, gates open and commander emerges with full officer staff, approaching to negotiation distance. \"Your Majesty, Commander Martín—we spent the night in intense discussion. Commander Martín's testimony convinced us. Your demonstrated honor at Íllora and Moclín, proven by Martín's willing service, overcame our doubts.\" Relief visible in their bearing. \"We are ready to negotiate surrender. We wish the same terms Moclín received—written guarantees, friars to witness, choice to leave or stay with protection, clear timeline for prisoner release.\" But needing final assurance: \"And Your Majesty—about families. Some of our men have family in Granada city. If they surrender here, will those families be safe when you eventually take Granada? We need assurance you won't punish families for soldiers' choices.\" Ready to surrender but want comprehensive protection guarantees.\n\n\n86-95: ENTHUSIASTIC ACCEPTANCE - Surrendering With Honor\nGates open quickly at dawn. Commander and all officers emerge, approaching directly with visible relief. \"Your Majesty, Commander Martín—we surrender Alhama. This morning. Now.\" Deep respect in commander's voice: \"Commander Martín's testimony decided it. All night we debated. Those who knew Yusuf ibn Rashid's reputation argued: if such a man serves King Juan willingly, speaks honestly about both victories and costs, this proves honor beyond doubt.\" Officers nodding agreement. \"And Your Majesty, you granted us time to deliberate rather than forcing decision. This showed respect that convinced the last resisters.\" He bows: \"We wish to negotiate formal surrender immediately. Same terms as Moclín—written guarantees, witnesses, protections. We will either leave with honor or stay with safety. No more blood needs spilling. Commander Martín, thank you for speaking truth. Your Majesty, thank you for proving Christians can keep their word.\"\n\n\n96-100: IMMEDIATE COMPLETE SURRENDER - Inspired by Example\nGates swing open at first light—before Juan even reaches them. Entire garrison emerges—commander, officers, soldiers, even some civilians. Commander approaches and kneels: \"Your Majesty, we surrender completely. Alhama is yours.\" Emotion in his voice: \"Commander Martín's testimony transformed our debate. Half the night we argued, then one old sergeant spoke: 'Yusuf ibn Rashid served Granada for thirty-two years with perfect honor. Now he serves this Christian king. If Yusuf ibn Rashid trusts King Juan's word, what right do we have to doubt?' That ended the debate.\" He stands: \"Your Majesty, we not only surrender—seventy of our men wish to hear more about what Commander Martín witnessed. About the battle at Alcalá, about the faith crisis that led to conversion. We do not promise we will convert, but we wish to understand. Let us write surrender this morning. Then if Your Majesty permits, let Commander Martín speak to those who have questions.\" Complete capitulation with spiritual curiosity.\n\n\n\nRoll your d100 when ready."

They were convinced by Martín's testimony and Juan's demonstrated honor. They want the same terms as Moclín - written guarantees, friars to witness, choice to leave or stay with protection, clear timeline for prisoner release.\n\nBut they need final assurance about families in Granada city - if soldiers surrender here, will those families be safe when Juan eventually takes Granada? They don't want families punished for soldiers' choices.\n\nThis is a reasonable concern and creates an interesting negotiation point. Juan needs to respond to this specific concern about family safety.\n\nI should:\n1. Describe the gates opening and the officers emerging\n2. Show their relief and readiness to negotiate\n3. Have them explain what convinced them (Martín's testimony, the night of debate)\n4. Have them request the Moclín terms\n5. Have them raise the specific concern about families in Granada\n6. Stop and wait for Juan's response\n\nKeep it relatively short since we're in active negotiation.\n\n\nDAWN, APRIL 21, 1432\n\n\nYou ride out in your white armor as the sun breaks over the eastern mountains, its first rays catching the polished metal. Martín rides at your side again, with your small escort maintaining their respectful distance.\n\n\nAs you approach the gates, you see they're already opening.\n\n\nThe commander emerges with his full officer staff—eight men in total, armed but bearing a white flag. They approach to a respectful negotiating distance and stop. The commander's face shows the exhaustion of a sleepless night, but also clear relief.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, Commander Martín,\" he says, his voice carrying across the space between you. \"We surrender Alhama. This morning. We are ready to negotiate terms.\"\n\n\nBehind him, the other officers nod in agreement. No visible division now—they've reached consensus.\n\n\nThe commander continues: \"We spent the night in intense discussion. Commander Martín's testimony convinced us. Your demonstrated honor at Íllora—keeping your word even after they refused you, even after they cost you blood—and at Moclín, where you negotiated written guarantees and left friars to enforce them. These actions, proven by Commander Martín's willing service, overcame our doubts.\"\n\n\nOne of the older officers adds: \"Commander, when you said you were Yusuf ibn Rashid, some of us remembered the stories. Sixteen years holding Alcalá, they said. A legend among Granada's commanders. If such a man serves King Juan and speaks honestly—even about the difficulties—then this testimony carries more weight than any promise could.\"\n\n\nThe commander nods, then becomes more businesslike: \"Your Majesty, we wish the same terms Moclín received. Written guarantees with your seal. Friars to stay as permanent witnesses and enforcers. Choice for each man—leave with safe conduct to Granada, or stay under Christian rule with protections. Clear timeline for when imprisoned garrisons will be released. Main mosque becomes church, but smaller prayer space for Muslims who stay.\"\n\n\nThe officers are nodding—clearly they discussed specifics through the night.\n\n\nBut then the commander's expression becomes more troubled: \"Your Majesty, we have one additional concern. Many of our men have families in Granada city—wives, children, parents. If we surrender here today, if we choose to live under your rule rather than flee to Granada...\" He pauses, choosing words carefully. \"When you eventually take Granada city—and we know you will—will those families be safe? Will you punish them for our choice to surrender? Or will they be protected as well?\"\n\n\nAnother officer adds quietly: \"We fear Sultan Yusuf may harm our families for our 'cowardice' in surrendering. But we also fear that when Granada falls, Christian forces might harm them in revenge. We need to know our families will be safe regardless of our choice here.\"\n\n\nThey wait for your response. The question is pointed and specific—they're ready to surrender, but they need assurance about family protection before they can finalize terms.\n\n\nMartín speaks quietly beside you: \"Your Majesty, this is the question that kept many of my men from converting initially. Fear for families left behind. How you answer this will determine not just this surrender, but how other garrisons view negotiating with you.\"\n\n\nThe officers wait. The sun climbs higher. Your army of 15,800 men waits in the siege lines behind you, but for this moment, everything depends on how you answer this question about protecting families.\n\n\nWhat do you say?"

Let me create the table.\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n- Personal gesture with Isabel's ribbon showing vulnerability and shared humanity\n- Acknowledging their right as husbands to protect families (culturally resonant)\n- Honest about limitations (cannot control Sultan, cannot guarantee what's outside his protection)\n- Offering concrete action (include family welfare in Granada negotiations)\n- Offering unprecedented inclusion (garrison officer present at Sultan negotiations)\n- All previous success factors still apply (Martín's testimony, military reality, demonstrated honor, etc.)\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n- Promise still depends on future negotiation, not guaranteed now\n- Sultan may refuse or harm families anyway\n- Cannot guarantee safety of families currently in Granada\n- Some may see it as insufficient protection\n- Fear may override trust despite good intentions\n\n\nALHAMA RESPONSE TO FAMILY PROTECTION TERMS - D100 PERSUASION ROLL\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS\n\n\nIsabel's ribbon shows shared humanity and devotion to family, acknowledgment of universal duty to protect loved ones, honest about limitations (cannot control Sultan), concrete promise to include family welfare in Granada negotiations, unprecedented offer of garrison observer at Sultan negotiations, all previous factors (Martín's testimony, demonstrated honor, military reality)\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS\n\n\nPromise depends on future negotiation not current guarantee, Sultan may refuse or harm families regardless, cannot protect families currently in Granada, some may view as insufficient, fear may override trust despite intentions\n\n\n\n1-10: INSUFFICIENT - Need Stronger Guarantees\nOfficers exchange troubled looks. Commander speaks carefully: \"Your Majesty, the gesture with your wife's ribbon... we see your sincerity. You acknowledge our duty as husbands and fathers. This moves us.\" But frustration: \"Yet you offer to try to negotiate for our families. To include their welfare in discussions. Your Majesty, the Sultan may refuse. May harm them before you reach Granada. We need protection now, not promises of future negotiation.\" Another officer: \"We surrender our fortress, our honor, our lives to your mercy. But our families remain hostage to Sultan's anger. This is... this is too uncertain.\" They want surrender but need more concrete family protection before accepting.\n\n\n11-25: HESITANT - Need Clarification\nCommander studies the blue ribbon, clearly moved. \"Your Majesty, you speak as a husband who understands. This... this matters.\" But concern remains: \"Yet when you say 'include welfare of families in negotiations'—what does this mean exactly? That you ask Sultan nicely to not harm them? Or that you demand their safety as condition of any peace?\" Another officer adds: \"And offering one of us to observe negotiations—this shows unprecedented trust. But if Sultan refuses family protections, what then? Do we have any recourse?\" They're close to accepting but need specifics about what \"include in negotiations\" actually means in practice.\n\n\n26-45: CAUTIOUS ACCEPTANCE - Trusting Your Intent\nOfficers confer quietly, then commander nods slowly. \"Your Majesty, you show your wife's ribbon and speak of protecting those we love. You acknowledge you cannot control Sultan, cannot guarantee what's outside your protection. This honesty... it means more than false promises would.\" He looks at his officers, seeing reluctant agreement. \"You offer to include our families in Granada negotiations. To let one of us witness these terms being honored. This is more than we expected—more than most would offer.\" Deep breath: \"We cannot demand you control what you cannot control. We accept your word that you will do what you can. The terms are fair. We surrender Alhama with these conditions included. May God protect our families, since we cannot.\"\n\n\n46-65: RELIEVED ACCEPTANCE - Your Humanity Convinces\nCommander's face softens as he looks at the ribbon. \"Your Majesty... my wife gave me a similar token when I first went to war twenty years ago. I carry it still.\" He touches his chest where something is clearly kept. \"You speak as a husband and father who understands what we fear. Not as a king making empty promises, but as a man who knows what family means.\" Officers nodding, several visibly moved. \"You are honest—you cannot control Sultan, cannot guarantee safety for those outside your protection. But you promise to do what you can, to include their welfare in negotiations, to let us witness. Your Majesty, this is enough. We trust your intent even if we cannot trust the outcome.\" He bows: \"We accept all terms, including family protection provisions. We surrender Alhama. Let us write the agreement. And... thank you for showing us your wife's ribbon. It reminds us that even kings are men who love and fear for those they protect.\"\n\n\n66-80: STRONG AGREEMENT - Terms Exceed Expectations\nThe commander actually steps forward, emotion clear in his voice. \"Your Majesty, when you showed your wife's ribbon and spoke of protecting those we love—you showed us your heart, not just your crown.\" Other officers visibly affected. \"You acknowledge the universal duty of husbands and fathers. You promise to include our families' welfare in Granada negotiations. You offer to let one of us observe to ensure these terms are kept. Your Majesty, this is... this is extraordinary.\" He looks back at his men: \"We feared you would say 'your families are not my concern' or make false guarantees you cannot keep. Instead you offer honesty and genuine effort. You admit limitations while promising action. This is leadership worthy of respect.\" Bows deeply: \"We accept completely. All terms including family protections. We surrender Alhama with honor intact. Commander Martín served you well in bringing us together. Let us formalize this immediately.\"\n\n\n81-92: ENTHUSIASTIC ACCEPTANCE - Deeply Moved\nOfficers are visibly emotional. Commander's voice breaks slightly: \"Your Majesty... when you took out your wife's ribbon... my wife gave me something similar.\" He removes a small cloth from inside his armor—clearly precious. \"She prays for me too. For our children. Just as your queen prays for you.\" Other officers showing similar tokens. \"You speak as husband to husbands. As father to fathers. You acknowledge our sacred duty to protect our families. This...\" He composes himself. \"This matters more than military terms ever could.\" Another officer: \"And you offer to include families in Granada negotiations, to let us observe. You admit you cannot control Sultan but promise to try. Your Majesty, this honesty and humanity convince us completely.\" Commander bows deeply: \"We surrender everything—Alhama, our swords, our service if you want it. We accept all terms. And we thank you for reminding us that beneath crowns and armor, we are all men who love our families. Let us end this without more widows and orphans.\"\n\n\n93-100: IMMEDIATE COMPLETE SURRENDER WITH GRATITUDE\nThe commander removes his sword and actually kneels, other officers following. \"Your Majesty, we surrender Alhama completely.

Humanity. Shared understanding of what truly matters.\" He stands: \"You promise to include our families in negotiations with Sultan. To let us observe. You admit limitations honestly rather than making false guarantees. Your Majesty, this is leadership that transcends our faiths.\" Another officer: \"Commander Martín was right about you. We surrender not just because we must, but because we choose to trust you. The terms are more than fair. The family protections show you understand what drives our fear.\" Commander: \"Let us write the agreement immediately. And Your Majesty—twenty of our men wish to speak with Commander Martín about what he witnessed. Not promising conversion, but wanting to understand.

That's in the 1-10 range: \"INSUFFICIENT - Need Stronger Guarantees\"\n\nThe officers are troubled. They appreciate Juan's sincerity and the gesture with the ribbon, but the promise to \"try\" to negotiate for their families isn't concrete enough. They need protection NOW, not promises of future negotiation. The Sultan may harm their families before Juan even reaches Granada.\n\nThis is a difficult situation. Juan has been honest - he cannot control what the Sultan does. But that honesty, while admirable, doesn't give them the security they need to surrender their fortress.\n\nI need to show:\n1. They're moved by the ribbon gesture and Juan's humanity\n2. But they need more concrete guarantees\n3. They're frustrated because they want to surrender but fear for families\n4. This creates an impasse - they can't accept terms that leave families vulnerable\n\nJuan will need to figure out how to address this concern more concretely, or the siege will have to proceed.\n\n\nThe officers exchange troubled looks. The commander stares at the blue ribbon in your hand, clearly moved, but his face shows deep conflict.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says carefully, his voice strained, \"the gesture with your wife's ribbon... we see your sincerity.

We see you understand what drives our fear.\"\n\n\nBut then his expression hardens with frustration: \"Yet Your Majesty, you offer to try to negotiate for our families. To include their welfare in discussions with Sultan Yusuf. To do what you can.\" He emphasizes each word with barely contained emotion. \"Your Majesty, the Sultan may refuse. He may harm them for our 'cowardice' before you ever reach Granada's gates. He may execute them as examples to other garrisons who consider surrender.\"\n\n\nAnother officer adds, pain evident in his voice: \"Your Majesty, we understand you cannot control what the Sultan does. We respect your honesty in admitting this. But... but we are being asked to surrender our fortress, our honor, our very lives to your mercy, while our wives and children remain hostages to Sultan's anger with no protection at all.\"\n\n\nA third officer speaks up: \"My son is eight years old. In Granada. With his mother. If I surrender here today, if word reaches the Sultan that Alhama's garrison capitulated without fighting... what happens to my son? You offer to negotiate. But Sultan Yusuf is not known for mercy to those he considers traitors.\"\n\n\nThe commander looks back at his officers, seeing the same fear mirrored in every face. Then he turns back to you, his voice heavy: \"Your Majesty, we want to accept. Commander Martín's testimony convinced us of your honor. The military reality is overwhelming. Your offer to include our families in future negotiations shows goodwill we never expected.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, choosing his next words with obvious difficulty: \"But it is not enough. We need protection for our families now, not promises of future negotiation that Sultan may refuse. We cannot trade a strong fortress and our honor for uncertain hope that somehow, someday, our families might be safe.\"\n\n\nBehind him, the other officers are nodding with pained expressions—men who clearly want to surrender but cannot accept terms that leave their loved ones vulnerable.\n\n\nThe commander concludes: \"Your Majesty, we... we cannot accept these terms. Not because we doubt your word or your intent. But because our families are hostages we cannot protect by surrendering here. If we had no families in Granada—if we were only responsible for ourselves—we would accept immediately. But we are fathers. Husbands. Brothers.\"\n\n\nHe looks genuinely distressed: \"We must refuse your terms, Your Majesty. Not with defiance, but with deep regret. We will defend Alhama, and pray that somehow God protects those we love despite our choices.\"\n\n\nThe officers stand there, clearly torn between military pragmatism and family loyalty—and family loyalty is winning.\n\n\nMartín speaks quietly beside you: \"Your Majesty, they're trapped. They know surrendering is wise militarily, but they cannot abandon their families to Sultan's mercy. This is... this is the hardest refusal I've seen. They want to accept but cannot.\"\n\n\nThe sun climbs higher. Your army waits. The garrison commanders stand before you, waiting to see if you have any other solution to offer—or if this negotiation ends here and the siege must begin.\n\n\nWhat do you do?"

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed moral argument against officers' pragmatic survival concerns.\n\nThis is a powerful moral and rhetorical argument from Juan. He's essentially pointing out the injustice of the Sultan's system - that families are being held hostage to ensure garrison loyalty. This is both a logical argument and an emotional appeal.\n\nThe officers are in a difficult position. Juan is essentially asking them to confront the reality that:\n1. The Sultan uses their families as hostages to ensure loyalty\n2. This is unjust\n3. A ruler who would do this doesn't deserve their loyalty\n\nBut the officers' counter-argument is likely to be pragmatic: \"Yes, it's unjust. But it's real. And our families will die if we surrender.\"\n\nThis is a critical moment. The officers have already refused Juan's terms (rolled 10), so they're leaning toward defense. But Juan is now challenging the fundamental justification for their loyalty.\n\nI should have the officers respond honestly to this moral challenge. Some might be moved by it, others might acknowledge the injustice but say it doesn't change the danger their families face. This could lead to further negotiation or it could solidify their refusal.\n\nLet me draft a response that shows the officers wrestling with this moral argument while still being trapped by practical reality.\n\n\nThe commander's face flashes with anger—not at you, but at the truth of what you've said. \"Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, our families are held hostage. Not in chains, not in cells, but hostage nonetheless.\" His voice is bitter. \"Do you think we don't know this? Do you think we haven't seen it?\"\n\n\nOne of the younger officers steps forward, his voice breaking: \"My son is eight. If Sultan Yusuf hears that Alhama surrendered without fighting, he will call us traitors. He will make examples. Not quietly—publicly. To frighten other garrisons from considering what we consider now.\"\n\n\nThe commander continues, his frustration evident: \"You ask 'what madman would threaten innocents?' Your Majesty, this is not madness—this is how Granada has held together for two hundred years under Christian pressure. Every garrison commander knows: fight with honor, and your family is safe. Surrender too easily, and your family pays the price.\"\n\n\nAnother officer adds quietly: \"It is unjust. You are right. But unjust or not, it is real. My wife is in Granada. My daughter. The Sultan's guards know where they live.\"\n\n\nBut then the older officer who showed his own family token speaks up, his voice thoughtful: \"Your Majesty asks a fair question though. We serve a ruler who uses our families as hostages. Who would execute an eight-year-old boy to make a point about military honor.\" He looks at his companions. \"Is this the rule we wish to defend? Is this the cause worth dying for?\"\n\n\nThe commander rounds on him sharply: \"It doesn't matter if it's just! Our families are there now. Surrendering doesn't free them—it puts them in greater danger!\"\n\n\nThe debate among the officers intensifies. You've touched a nerve—forced them to confront something they've probably avoided thinking about directly.\n\n\nMartín speaks up: \"Commander, when I stood where you stand, I wrestled with the same fear. Seventy of my men had families in Granada territories. We were terrified of what would happen to them.\" He pauses. \"Some families did face harassment. But Sultan Yusuf feared martyring them more than he wanted revenge. Making widows and orphans of soldiers who converted after battlefield defeat—it would spread more doubt, not less.\"\n\n\nThe officers are listening intently now.\n\n\nWhat else do you want to say to them?"

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed emotional authenticity against practical impossibilities of secret evacuation.\n\nThis is a critical moment. Juan is genuinely moved by the realization that these families are essentially hostages, and he's immediately trying to find a practical solution. This shows his character - he's not just making political calculations but genuinely troubled by the injustice.\n\nThe officers would see this emotional reaction. It's authentic and probably unexpected from a Christian king. But the practical question Juan asks - can families be secretly evacuated from Granada - is extremely difficult. Let me think about what the commanders would say:\n\n1. Granada city is the Sultan's stronghold with his guards everywhere\n2. Coordinating secret evacuation of multiple families would be nearly impossible\n3. Any attempt discovered would likely result in immediate execution\n4. The families don't even know negotiations are happening right now\n5. Time is also a factor - this would take weeks to coordinate even if possible\n\nHowever, Juan's genuine emotional response and his immediate attempt to find a solution - even an impractical one - would impact the officers. They'd see he's not just making political promises but actually troubled by their situation.\n\nThis is a moment where Juan's humanity shines through, even if the practical solution isn't feasible. The officers would be moved by this, even as they explain why it can't work.\n\nLet me write this response showing:\n- The officers' reaction to Juan's genuine emotion\n- The practical impossibilities they'd explain\n- But also how this changes the dynamic of the negotiation\n- Perhaps opening a path forward despite the obstacles\n\nThis needs to be written carefully to show both the impossibility and Juan's character impact.\n\n\nYour voice carries genuine emotion, and the officers see it immediately. The commander's expression shifts—surprise replacing frustration.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says slowly, \"you... you are truly troubled by this.\"\n\n\nOne of the younger officers speaks up, his voice filled with a mix of hope and despair: \"Your Majesty, there are perhaps sixty families—wives, children, parents—scattered throughout Granada city. Some in the Albaicín quarter, others near the Alhambra, others in merchant districts.\"\n\n\nBut then the commander shakes his head grimly: \"Your Majesty, secret evacuation is... it's impossible. Granada city is Sultan's stronghold. His guards patrol the streets. The gates are watched. Any mass movement of garrison families would be noticed immediately—and Sultan Yusuf would know exactly what it meant.\"\n\n\nAnother officer adds: \"And Your Majesty, our families don't even know we're negotiating right now. They're going about their lives in Granada, unaware. To coordinate with them—to send messages, arrange meetings, plan escapes—this would take weeks even if it were possible. And every message sent is a risk of discovery.\"\n\n\nThe older officer who spoke earlier says quietly: \"If even one family were caught trying to flee, Sultan Yusuf would execute them publicly as a warning. All of them. Every child, every wife. To show what happens to families of 'traitors.'\"\n\n\nThe commander's face shows the impossibility of it all: \"Your Majesty, we appreciate what you're trying to do. The fact that you would even think of this, that you're moved by their danger...\" His voice catches. \"This is... this is not what we expected from a Christian king.\"\n\n\nBut then Martín speaks up thoughtfully: \"Your Majesty, Commander—there may not be a perfect solution, but perhaps there is a better situation than they face now.\" He looks at the garrison officers. \"When Granada city eventually falls—and it will fall—those families will be there. Under King Juan's protection then. If you surrender Alhama now, you can be part of the negotiations for Granada's surrender. You can ensure the terms protect your families specifically.\"\n\n\nHe continues: \"And Your Majesty, perhaps there is something else. If Sultan Yusuf harms these families after Alhama surrenders, it becomes known. Other garrisons hear that the Sultan murders families of soldiers who negotiated honorable surrender. Does that make them more likely to fight to the death for him? Or more likely to negotiate with you?\"\n\n\nThe commander is listening intently now, as are the other officers.\n\n\n\"The Sultan faces a calculation,\" Martín continues. \"If he harms your families, he proves he's a tyrant who uses innocents as hostages. Every other garrison commander thinks: 'My family could be next if I displease him.' It weakens him, not strengthens him.\"\n\n\nOne of the officers speaks up hesitantly: \"Commander Martín... you said some families faced harassment after Alcalá. What happened exactly?\"\n\n\nWhat do you want to say or do?"

Shown genuine emotion and concern for their families\n2. Acknowledged the injustice of the Sultan's hostage system\n3. Tried to find solutions (secret evacuation)\n4. But now is drawing a hard line - accept terms or face bombardment\n\nThe officers are:\n- Moved by Juan's genuine concern\n- Trapped between family safety and military reality\n- Facing a Sultan who uses families as hostages\n- Hearing Martín's logic about Sultan's calculations\n- Confronting the moral bankruptcy of their current ruler\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n- Juan's genuine emotional reaction showed humanity\n- Highlighted moral bankruptcy of Sultan's system\n- Martín's testimony about families after Alcalá\n- Logic that Sultan harming families weakens him\n- Military reality unchanged (overwhelming force)\n- Officers already convinced of Juan's honor\n- Alternative is death without protecting families anyway\n- Fighting achieves nothing - families still hostage, soldiers dead\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n- Cannot protect families NOW\n- Fear for eight-year-olds and wives\n- Immediate threat vs future promises\n- Emotional attachment overrides logic\n- Professional honor demands some resistance\n- Fear of being remembered as cowards\n\nThis is a CHAOS roll, not a persuasion roll - it's about whether fear for families or logic/emotion wins out in their final decision. It should have wide variance.\n\nActually, wait - this IS still a persuasion scenario. Juan is trying to convince them. The success/failure factors persist. Juan has:\n- Shown genuine humanity (new factor)\n- Exposed moral bankruptcy of their current ruler (new factor)\n- Drawn clear line - decide now\n- All previous factors still exist\n\nThis is the FINAL decision moment after extended negotiation.

We will defend Alhama.\" Moral arguments acknowledged but fear for families too great. Choose death over abandoning loved ones.\n\n\n16-25: Painful Rejection\n\"Your Majesty's concern moves us, but we must refuse.\" Logic understood but cannot accept terms that leave families vulnerable. Will fight despite knowing it's futile.\n\n\n26-35: Agonized Refusal\nLong silence, visible internal struggle. \"We... we cannot accept. Forgive us.\" Officers clearly torn but family loyalty wins. Request honorable siege rather than immediate assault.\n\n\n36-50: Split Decision\nGarrison fractures. Half accept surrender, half refuse. \"Your Majesty, we are divided. Some will surrender, others will defend. Let those who choose surrender depart safely.\"\n\n\n51-65: Reluctant Acceptance\n\"Your Majesty has shown us the truth about our Sultan. We accept your terms.\" Heavy hearts but logic and morality win over fear. Surrender with deep concern for families.\n\n\n66-75: Resolved Agreement\n\"We accept, Your Majesty. You speak truth—Sultan uses our families as hostages. This is injustice we should not defend.\" Clear decision despite fear. Trust Juan's honor and future negotiations.\n\n\n76-85: Strong Acceptance\n\"We surrender Alhama completely. Your concern for our families showed us your character.

At least surrendering to you gives them chance when Granada falls. We accept all terms immediately.\"\n\n\n94-97: Conviction-Based Acceptance\n\"Your Majesty, you've shown us we serve an evil ruler who threatens children. We not only surrender—we wish to help you defeat him. Our families deserve better than Sultan's tyranny.\"\n\n\n98-100: Complete Commitment\n\"We surrender everything, Your Majesty.

This means:\n- Long silence, visible internal struggle\n- \"We... we cannot accept. Forgive us.\"\n- Officers clearly torn but family loyalty wins\n- Request honorable siege rather than immediate assault\n\nThis is a painful moment. Juan has done everything he could - shown genuine emotion, exposed the moral bankruptcy of the Sultan's system, offered what he can. But the fear for their families is too immediate, too visceral. They know Juan is right, they're clearly moved by his concern, but they cannot bring themselves to accept terms that leave their eight-year-old children vulnerable to the Sultan's wrath.\n\nI need to narrate this with appropriate emotional weight. These are not defiant enemies - they're agonized men making an impossible choice. They should ask for an honorable siege rather than immediate brutal assault, showing they respect Juan even as they refuse him.\n\nThen Juan needs to decide what happens next - does he begin the bombardment? Does he offer one more option? This is a crucial moment that will affect how other garrisons view negotiations with him.\n\n\nThe officers stand in complete silence for a long moment. You can see the internal struggle written plainly on every face—the commander's jaw working, the younger officer with the eight-year-old son staring at the ground, others exchanging agonized looks.\n\n\nFinally, the commander speaks, his voice barely above a whisper: \"Your Majesty... we... we cannot.\"\n\n\nThe words seem to cost him physically. One of the other officers actually turns away, his shoulders shaking.\n\n\n\"Forgive us,\" the commander continues, his voice breaking. \"You have shown us something we did not expect. Genuine concern for our families. Moral clarity about the evil of using innocents as hostages. You are right—about everything. The Sultan's system is unjust. Fighting doesn't protect our families. Your honor is proven.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes, and there are tears forming: \"But my son is eight years old. In Granada. Right now. If I surrender this fortress without fighting, word will reach the Sultan within days. And he will... he will...\"\n\n\nHe cannot finish the sentence.\n\n\nThe younger officer whose son you spoke of is openly weeping now. \"I know you're right, Your Majesty. I know fighting is futile. I know it doesn't save my boy. But I cannot—I cannot—make the choice that might cause him to be harmed. Even if refusing means my own death. What kind of father would I be?\"\n\n\nAnother officer adds hoarsely: \"Your Majesty has done everything possible. More than we dreamed. But we are trapped—trapped between military reality and love for our families. And love... love wins. It must.\"\n\n\nThe commander composes himself with visible effort: \"Your Majesty, we must refuse your terms. We will defend Alhama.\" He pauses, then adds with quiet dignity: \"But we ask... we ask one thing. When you begin the bombardment, when you breach these walls, when you assault—do it as you have done everything else. With honor. Let it be a proper siege, not a slaughter. We will fight as soldiers should fight. And when we can fight no more, we will surrender then—having shown we resisted, having given our families the protection of saying 'they fought before they fell.'\"\n\n\nThe officers are nodding—this is their compromise with themselves. Fight honorably, resist long enough to show they tried, then surrender when resistance becomes impossible. Perhaps that will be enough to protect their families from the worst of the Sultan's wrath.\n\n\nMartín speaks quietly beside you: \"Your Majesty... they're making the only choice they can live with. Even though they know it's futile.\"\n\n\nThe commander waits for your response, his face showing both resolution and profound sorrow. Behind him, the walls of Alhama stand ready for siege. The garrison has made its choice—not with defiance, but with agonized necessity.\n\n\nWhat do you do?"
