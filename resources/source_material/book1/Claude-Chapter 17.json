They've specified that this is the day after a battle, and Juan II is using the day to heal wounded, rest, and consolidate forces.\n\nKey instructions I need to follow:\n1. NEVER draft dialogue for Juan or his actions - stop and let the player write what he does\n2. Write in SHORT responses \n3. Let the player write how Juan responds EVERY TIME\n4. This is narrative/world-building mode, not dialogue mode yet\n5. I need to search the project knowledge to understand what happened in previous chapters, especially the battle that just occurred\n\nLet me search for information about the recent battle and the current situation.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Synthesized battle details and established narrative constraints for chapter progression.\n\nGood! I found the information about Chapter 16. The Battle of Alcalá la Real occurred on April 1, 1431. It was a decisive victory where:\n\n- Sultan Muhammad IX's army of 16,000 was destroyed\n- Castilian casualties: 400-500 dead, 300-400 seriously wounded, 600-800 lightly wounded (out of 23,000)\n- Enemy casualties: 4,000-5,000 dead on field, ~1,200 prisoners, only 2,000-3,000 escaped\n- Juan personally experienced combat, including a guardian knight (Martín de Oviedo) being wounded saving his life\n- After the battle, the fortress garrison of Alcalá la Real surrendered with ~70-140 Muslims converting to Christianity\n- Notable converts include Yusuf ibn Rashid (commander with 32 years experience), his son Ibrahim, and Qadi Ahmad al-Zarqali (scholar)\n\nThe chapter ended on the night of April 1/early morning of April 2, 1431, at Alcalá la Real.\n\nNow the player wants to use the next day (April 2) to heal wounded, rest, and consolidate. \n\nKey instructions:\n- NEVER draft dialogue or actions for Juan\n- Write SHORT responses\n- Stop and let the player write Juan's responses\n- This is likely a narrative/descriptive moment where I set the scene\n\nI should describe the day of April 2, what's happening in the camp, the condition of wounded, the mood, etc., but NOT make Juan do or say anything. Keep it brief and end with something that invites the player's response.\n\n\nChapter 17: Consolidation\n\n\n\nApril 2, 1431 — Alcalá la Real\n\n\nDawn breaks over the fortress, revealing the aftermath of yesterday's slaughter. The fields south of the walls are carpeted with bodies—Moorish dead sprawled where they fell, some still clutching weapons, others face-down in the bloodied earth. Castilian work parties move among them with grim efficiency, stripping armor and valuables, pulling aside any who yet live for the surgeons.\n\n\nInside the fortress, the atmosphere is strange—victory's elation mingles with exhaustion and the groans of wounded men. The medical stations established in the courtyard overflow with injured: Castilian knights with gashed limbs, infantry with broken bones, a few Moorish prisoners receiving the same care. Fray Hernando moves between the pallets with his priests, offering last rites to the dying, prayers for the living.\n\n\nThe Guardian knight Martín de Oviedo lies among the seriously wounded. The mamluk's blade opened his neck and shoulder badly; the surgeons have sewn him shut and bound the wound tight, but fever may still claim him. His brother knights keep vigil in shifts.\n\n\nThroughout the fortress, men sleep where they can—collapsed against walls, curled in cloaks on the cobblestones. The army has fought, marched, and fought again. They need rest desperately.\n\n\nThe converts gather in a separate courtyard under guard—not hostile, but watchful. Yusuf ibn Rashid stands among them, organizing the men who chose baptism from those who will depart south. Ahmad al-Zarqali sits with Fray Hernando, conversing in low tones about theology and the catechism.\n\n\nInfante Enrique awaits in the fortress's great hall, where captured maps and documents are spread across tables. Álvaro de Luna has gathered the senior commanders for consultation when the king is ready.\n\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

I need to have Enrique respond with his perspective on what happened - specifically his part holding the siege works during the Sultan's initial assault.\n\nFrom the project knowledge, I know:\n- Infante Enrique commanded 5,000 elite troops at the siege works\n- They held prepared positions when the Sultan's exhausted forces attacked\n- The engagement was one-sided - the Moorish troops were too exhausted to fight effectively\n- The enemy formations broke quickly with minimal Castilian losses\n- This was a key part of the deception plan\n\nI should keep this response relatively short and let the dialogue flow naturally. Enrique would be proud but also somewhat surprised at how easily the enemy collapsed. He's a veteran commander, so he'd recognize this wasn't a normal engagement.\n\nI should NOT draft any dialogue or actions for Juan - just have Enrique respond and stop.\n\n\nInfante Enrique looks up from the maps, exhaustion evident in his face despite the victory. He's still wearing his armor, though someone has removed the worst of the blood and mud.\n\n\n\"Juan.\" He clasps your arm in greeting. \"It was... strange, honestly. The strangest battle I've fought.\"\n\n\nHe moves to the window overlooking the southern fields where the bodies still lie.\n\n\n\"We watched them come—sixteen thousand men in column, exactly as the scouts reported. They deployed into formation perhaps half a mile out, and we braced for the assault. My men were ready, the positions strong. I expected a hard fight.\"\n\n\nHe shakes his head slowly.\n\n\n\"But when they reached us, they were barely moving. Stumbling forward like drunkards. Some weren't even holding their weapons properly. We cut them down—God forgive me, it felt like butchery more than battle. Whole units just... stopped. Stood there while officers screamed at them. One group of five hundred simply turned around and walked away before we'd even seriously engaged them.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to face you.\n\n\n\"I've seen exhausted men before, but nothing like this. They'd marched themselves into uselessness. The Sultan gambled everything on catching us unprepared, and instead delivered his army to slaughter.\" His expression is troubled. \"We lost perhaps thirty men holding those works. Thirty, out of five thousand engaged. The enemy lost... hundreds? A thousand? I'm still not certain.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"What was it like leading the cavalry charge?\""

Let me recall from the chapter summary:\n\n1. First charge (rolled 17) - Contested breakthrough, hard fight:\n- Juan led 4,000 heavy cavalry\n- Smashed into Moorish right flank/infantry which was already wavering\n- But then 2,000 Moroccan elite cavalry counter-charged\n- Fierce melee developed\n- Juan had personal combat - parried a blade, arm numbed\n- Guardian knight Martín de Oviedo was wounded saving Juan's life\n- Moroccans eventually withdrew but it was a hard fight\n\n2. Second pursuit (rolled 13) - Also contested:\n- Juan rallied ~800 cavalry (rolled 29 for moderate rally)\n- Led flanking maneuver against fleeing forces\n- Moroccan cavalry formed blocking force to protect retreat\n- Running cavalry battle, close combat\n- Another guardian wounded saving Juan\n- Limited success - Sultan's main body (3,000+) escaped\n- Breakthrough achieved but disorganized and costly\n\nEnrique's asking about the cavalry experience. Juan is explaining the contrast - the infantry collapsed easily, but the Moroccan cavalry fought professionally and hard, twice sacrificing themselves as rearguard.\n\nI should have Enrique respond to this, showing understanding of what Juan experienced. This was Juan's first real combat. Enrique would recognize the significance and perhaps the danger Juan was in. He might express concern, respect, or both. Keep it conversational and brief.\n\n\nEnrique's expression shifts to something more serious, concerned even.\n\n\n\"The Moroccans.\" He nods slowly. \"Professional soldiers, those. Mamluks and their cavalry aren't militia—they train from boyhood. They knew they were covering a rout, and they did their duty.\"\n\n\nHe studies you more carefully now, perhaps seeing you differently than before the battle.\n\n\n\"That's real cavalry combat, cousin. Not a tournament, not a skirmish. Steel on steel, horses colliding, everything happening faster than thought.\" His voice drops. \"I heard one of your guardians took a blade meant for you. Martín de Oviedo.\"\n\n\nA pause.\n\n\n\"You led from the front. In white armor, visible to every enemy on that field. That's... brave. Perhaps too brave for a king whose death would end this crusade.\" There's no criticism in his tone, just frank concern. \"But the men saw you there. That matters.\"\n\n\nHe glances back at the maps on the table.\n\n\n\"The Moroccan cavalry bought the Sultan his life, and perhaps two or three thousand survivors. They're probably reaching Granada today, spreading news of the catastrophe. Which brings us to the question—what do we do now? The enemy's field army is destroyed. We hold Alcalá. The western army should be striking the coast as we speak. Granada is open before us.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you expectantly."

He's rejecting the temptation to overextend and is thinking about the bigger picture. This is smart leadership - recognizing that even after a massive victory, there are still risks.\n\nKey points Juan is making:\n1. Don't overextend toward Granada city itself\n2. Risk of being cut off by western forces (though they should be engaged with the western army)\n3. Consolidate the current position\n4. Move systematically to the next fortress\n5. Continue reconnaissance\n6. Wait to see how the western army does\n7. Still optimistic about taking Granada this year but being methodical\n\nEnrique should respond positively to this wisdom, perhaps agree, and then they can discuss practical next steps - which fortress, timing, the converts, etc. Keep it short and conversational.\n\n\nEnrique nods approvingly, relief evident on his face.\n\n\n\"Thank God. I was afraid you might be tempted to chase glory all the way to the Alhambra gates.\" He taps the map. \"You're right—Granada still has perhaps two thousand men on the western frontier. If we pushed for the capital and they forced-marched back while the Sultan rallied what's left of his army... we could find ourselves caught between two forces in unfamiliar territory.\"\n\n\nHe traces the fortress chain with his finger.\n\n\n\"Methodical conquest is how we win this. Take each fortress, secure our supply lines, deny them ground step by step. We have momentum now—the garrison here surrendered after watching that battle. Others will hear of it.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna approaches the table, having been listening.\n\n\n\"The question becomes which fortress next, Your Majesty. Íllora is twelve miles northwest—smaller than Alcalá, commands the approach to Granada from this direction. Or Loja, fifteen miles west—larger, more strategic, but tougher. We could also sweep smaller fortifications to fully secure this region before pushing deeper.\"\n\n\nEnrique adds: \"And we need word from the western army. They should be hitting the coast now or within a day. If Álvaro de Estúñiga has taken Málaga or Almería...\" He doesn't finish, but the implication is clear—Granada would be in true crisis.\n\n\n\"How long do you want to rest here before moving?\""

This is a shift from the \"consolidate and move to next fortress\" approach he just stated, but not quite a \"mad dash\" - he wants to be methodical but aggressive, using siege weapons.\n\nI should clarify the strategic situation and available targets. Enrique and Álvaro would likely present the realistic options for major fortresses between Alcalá and Granada.\n\nI need to keep this short and let Juan respond. Don't write his dialogue or actions.\n\n\nEnrique straightens, reassessing. \"Aggressive but methodical—use our bombards to crack their major fortresses before they can regroup. I like it.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro moves closer to the map, pointing out the fortress chain.\n\n\n\"The major positions between us and Granada proper are Íllora and Loja. Both are significant fortifications.\" He traces the distances. \"Íllora is twelve miles northwest, directly on the road to Granada—about twenty miles from the capital itself. Smaller garrison, maybe three to four hundred men, but strong walls. Commands the northern approach.\"\n\n\nHe shifts his finger. \"Loja is fifteen miles west-southwest of us, larger—perhaps six to eight hundred men garrison strength normally. It's their anchor fortress for this whole region. Taking Loja would be a major blow, but it's a harder nut to crack.\"\n\n\nEnrique adds: \"With our bombards, either is achievable. The question is whether we split our focus or concentrate. We could also bypass smaller fortifications and push both—siege Íllora while demonstrating against Loja, force them to divide whatever reserves they can scrape together.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro nods slowly. \"The bombards take time to emplace and begin work—three to five days typically to breach walls strong enough to require them.

This allows continuous operations while not overextending exhausted troops\n\nThis is smart medieval campaign management. I should have Enrique and Álvaro respond to the plan, work out the details of the split, and ask practical questions about composition of the force moving forward.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods approvingly. \"Sound thinking, Your Majesty. Keep pressure on them while letting the most exhausted troops recover here.\"\n\n\nEnrique moves to the map, calculating. \"Of our twenty-three thousand, perhaps three thousand are wounded or genuinely exhausted—the men who held the siege works, the cavalry who fought in both melees. We can leave them here with the medical staff and a security garrison.\"\n\n\nHe continues: \"The bombards and their crews are already packed and ready—they never fully deployed here.

Taking himself and Álvaro back to Jaén to coordinate the three-pronged campaign\n\nThis is actually quite smart - he's centralizing command and communications rather than being stuck at one siege.

Let me craft the dispatch letters from Álvaro de Estúñiga accordingly.\n\nKey points for this result:\n- Successful landing and siege operations\n- Vélez-Málaga or similar mid-sized fortified port taken after 4-6 days\n- Citadel surrendered after bombardment\n- 50-80 casualties\n- Solid foothold established but no cascading effects yet\n- Asking for orders: press on or consolidate?\n\nI need to write realistic military dispatches that would come from a campaign commander. There should be two dispatches as mentioned - one sent during operations, one after the objective was secured.\n\nFirst dispatch: Probably sent around April 3-4, reporting landing and initial siege\nSecond dispatch: Sent around April 6-7, reporting success and asking for orders\n\nThe tone should be professional, factual, military - not overly dramatic. Álvaro de Estúñiga is an experienced commander reporting to his king.\n\n\nÁlvaro unfolds the first dispatch, dated April 4th.\n\n\n\nFirst Dispatch from Álvaro de Estúñiga\n\n\nTo His Majesty King Juan II of Castile, from Álvaro de Estúñiga, Commander of the Western Army\n\n\nYour Majesty,\n\n\nI write from our beachhead three miles east of Vélez-Málaga. The fleet made landfall on April 2nd without opposition—the coastal defenses were undermanned, perhaps 200 men attempting to hold positions meant for twice that number. Our landing was contested but brief. Casualties: 23 dead, 41 wounded.\n\n\nBy April 3rd we had established siege positions around Vélez-Málaga's citadel. The town itself fell within hours—the garrison withdrew to the fortified upper citadel commanding the harbor. I estimate 400-500 defenders remain, adequately provisioned.\n\n\nWe began bombardment yesterday with our siege artillery. The walls are taking damage but the defenders show no signs of surrender yet. They fight professionally despite being isolated and outnumbered.\n\n\nNo relief force has appeared. Granada's western defenses appear as skeletal as our scouts reported. I expect the citadel will fall within 3-4 days, barring complications.\n\n\nI await further intelligence regarding the eastern campaign and your orders for subsequent operations.\n\n\nWritten this 4th day of April, 1431\nÁlvaro de Estúñiga\n\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down the first letter and opens the second, dated April 7th.\n\n\n\nSecond Dispatch from Álvaro de Estúñiga\n\n\nTo His Majesty King Juan II of Castile\n\n\nYour Majesty,\n\n\nVélez-Málaga has fallen. The citadel surrendered on the morning of April 6th after four days of bombardment opened two breaches in the walls. The garrison commander—one Muhammad al-Badisi—requested terms. I accepted his surrender: garrison granted safe passage south with personal weapons only. All military stores, equipment, and fortifications remain intact in our possession.\n\n\nFinal casualties for the operation: 58 dead, 94 wounded (most from the initial landing and early skirmishes). The citadel garrison numbered 380 men when they marched out.\n\n\nWe now hold a fortified port with adequate harbor facilities. The town's population (~2,000 souls) remains largely in place—frightened but not hostile. We have established military government and begun securing supply lines.\n\n\nIntelligence from prisoners indicates Granada is aware of our presence but has no forces available to contest us. Rumors of a major engagement in the east are circulating among the Moorish troops, though details remain unclear to them.\n\n\nI respectfully request orders, Your Majesty:\n\n\nOption 1: Press westward toward Málaga itself (20 miles distant). Málaga is Granada's primary port—garrisoned with perhaps 800-1,000 men. Taking it would be a major blow but would require commitment of our full force to a potentially lengthy siege.\n\n\nOption 2: Consolidate at Vélez-Málaga. Fortify our position, establish supply depots, use the port as a permanent base for future operations. This secures what we have gained without risking overextension.\n\n\nOption 3: Sweep eastward along the coast toward Almuñécar and Motril—smaller targets that might fall quickly, expanding our coastal foothold without engaging Málaga's stronger defenses.\n\n\nThe fleet remains in good condition. Morale is high. The men await your command.\n\n\nWritten this 7th day of April, 1431\nÁlvaro de Estúñiga\n\n\n\nÁlvaro looks up at you. \"So—Vélez-Málaga is ours. A solid victory, not spectacular but professionally executed. And now he's asking what to do with twelve thousand men and thirty ships sitting on Granada's coast.\"\n\n\nHe taps the map. \"Málaga is the prize—Granada's main port, their economic lifeline. But it's also their strongest coastal fortress. Estúñiga is being cautious, asking permission before committing to a major siege.\"\n\n\n\"What are your orders, Your Majesty?\""

This is actually a clever strategy given his paralyzed military situation. Let me think about what would be realistic:\n\nIn favor of some success:\n- Aragon has reasons to be wary of a too-powerful Castile\n- Alfonso V might be concerned about Juan II's growing power\n- The Infantes' situation (they renounced succession) creates Aragonese succession uncertainty\n- Granada has historically played Christian kingdoms against each other\n- Medieval diplomacy was complex and alliances shifted\n- Portugal might be concerned if Isabel is pregnant (peace for grandchild's sake)\n- Navarre often played balancing role between larger powers\n- Offering territorial concessions, trade deals, or gold could tempt some\n- Juan II is young and might be seen as inexperienced/overreaching\n\nAgainst success:\n- This is a papal crusade with religious legitimacy\n- Breaking from crusade means breaking with Pope\n- Granada just suffered catastrophic defeat - looks weak\n- Christian kingdoms have more to gain from Granada's fall than from alliance\n- Alfonso V is Juan's brother-in-law (married to María)\n- Recent reconciliation after Infantes crisis\n- Crusade momentum is very strong\n- Theological narrative (Alcalá conversions) suggests divine favor for Christians\n- Sultan's paralyzed court may execute diplomacy poorly\n- Time pressure - fortresses falling while diplomacy progresses\n\nI should create a table that reflects:\n- Very low chance of major success (stopping crusade)\n- Moderate chance of minor complications/delays\n- High chance of limited or no effect\n- Possibility of backfire (strengthening Christian unity)\n\nThe roll of 82 would fall into moderate success range -

breaking with it means breaking with Pope\n\nGranada just catastrophically defeated - looks desperate/weak\n\nAlfonso V married to Juan's sister María (family connection)\n\nRecent reconciliation after Infantes crisis\n\nCrusade has massive momentum and divine favor narrative\n\nBreaking crusade vows has spiritual/political costs\n\nSultan's paralyzed court may execute poorly\n\nTime pressure -

Granada's Internal Response (Rolled 27): **Severe Crisis - Paralysis**\n   - Sultan survives but authority badly damaged\n   - Court paralyzed by recriminations and fear\n   - Debates rage about strategy\n   - Military commanders demoralized, conflicting orders\n   - Fortresses receiving little guidance\n   - Theological debates consuming energy\n   - Slow, confused response to Christian advances\n   - Ineffective resistance due to leadership paralysis\n\n2. Sultan's Response Strategy (Rolled 82): **Diplomatic Offensive - Exploit Christian Divisions**\n   - Sultan launches multiple diplomatic initiatives simultaneously\n   - Mission to Aragon, Navarre, Portugal\n   - Try to create diplomatic complications for Juan II\n   - Stalling tactic\n   - Meanwhile fortresses ordered to hold out\n\n3. Diplomatic Success Level (Rolled 19): **Minimal Response - Polite Refusals**\n   - Embassies received but offers rejected\n   - Aragon: \"Cannot interfere in Papal crusade\"\n   - Portugal: \"Will not undermine son-in-law's holy mission\"\n   - Navarre: \"No strategic interest in Granada's survival\"\n   - Diplomatic courtesy maintained but no substance\n   - No military or political impact on crusade\n   - Sultan gains nothing but at least doesn't worsen position\n\nNow I need to write a narrative summary of what's happening in Granada's court and with the Sultan, weaving all these elements together. This should be a GM narration describing the situation from Granada's perspective.\n\n\nGranada - The Alhambra Palace, April 7-10, 1431\n\n\n\nThe survivors began arriving on April 3rd.\n\n\nFirst came the cavalry—exhausted, scattered groups of Moroccan mamluks and Granadan horsemen who'd screened the Sultan's flight. Then the walking wounded, straggling up the road in ones and twos. By April 4th, when Sultan Muhammad IX himself rode through the Alhambra gates with perhaps three hundred personal guards, the scope of the catastrophe was undeniable.\n\n\nOf sixteen thousand men who'd marched north five days earlier, fewer than three thousand returned.\n\n\n\nThe Court's Paralysis\n\n\nThe Alhambra's council chambers became a cauldron of recrimination and fear. The Sultan—thirty-two years old, exhausted, haunted—faced a court that barely concealed its fury.\n\n\n\"You led them to slaughter!\" screamed the Qadi of Granada, an elderly jurist who'd lost two sons at Alcalá. \"Sixteen thousand faithful men, dead because you gambled on catching the Christians unprepared!\"\n\n\n\"The intelligence was good,\" the Sultan replied, his voice hoarse. \"They were building fieldworks. We should have—\"\n\n\n\"They were waiting for us!\" This from Ibn Khalil, commander of the western frontier forces. \"Their entire army deployed in perfect formation. Their heavy cavalry held in reserve. It was a trap.\"\n\n\nThe vizier attempted to restore order, but the debates raged for hours. What went wrong? Was the march too fast? Should they have avoided battle? Was it divine judgment for some sin?\n\n\nThe theological arguments consumed as much time as the military ones. The mass conversions at Alcalá la Real haunted everyone—seventy Muslim warriors renouncing Islam after watching the battle. What did it mean?\n\n\n\"God tests the faithful,\" insisted the Grand Imam. \"This is trial, not abandonment.\"\n\n\n\"Then why did He allow such slaughter?\" countered the qadi. \"Why did He permit our banner to fall while theirs flew triumphant?\"\n\n\nNo answers emerged. Only more questions, more blame, more paralysis.\n\n\n\nMilitary Assessment\n\n\nThe military situation was assessed coldly by those still capable of strategic thought:\n\n\nField Army: Destroyed. Of the 16,000 committed, perhaps 2,800 returned. Combat effective? Maybe 1,500-2,000 after the wounded are accounted for.\n\nWestern Forces: 2,000 troops scattered along the frontier. Now report that Vélez-Málaga has fallen to a Castilian amphibious assault.\n\nGarrison Troops: Perhaps 3,000-4,000 men spread across dozens of fortresses throughout the emirate.\n\nTotal Available: ~6,500-8,000 troops to defend an entire kingdom under simultaneous assault from two directions.\n\n\nThe Master of the Arsenal—a grizzled veteran named Ali ibn Musa—laid it out bluntly: \"We cannot field another army. We can defend fortresses. We can conduct raids with small cavalry forces. But if the Christians bring their full strength against Granada city itself, we will fall. It is only a question of time.\"\n\n\n\"Then what do you propose?\" the Sultan asked quietly.\n\n\n\"Foreign aid. Immediately. The Marinids in Morocco. Anyone.\"\n\n\n\nThe Diplomatic Gambit\n\n\nBy April 8th, after five days of chaotic debate, the Sultan finally imposed his will on the paralyzed court. The decision: a desperate diplomatic offensive.\n\n\nFour embassies were prepared simultaneously:\n\n\nTo Aragon (Alfonso V): Ambassador Ibrahim al-Tawil carried letters emphasizing historical Granadan-Aragonese cooperation, offering territorial concessions in eastern Granada, trade privileges, and 20,000 gold dinars for \"mediation services.\" The appeal: \"You share a brother-in-law with Castile, but do you wish to see him control all of Iberia?\"\n\n\nTo Portugal (João I): Ambassador Muhammad ibn Yusuf bore letters playing on family ties—the Sultan's daughter had once been proposed as a bride for a Portuguese prince. The message emphasized protecting Princess Isabel (now Queen of Castile) from the dangers of crusade warfare, and requesting Portuguese intercession for \"honorable peace terms.\"\n\n\nTo Navarre (Juan II): Letters emphasizing Navarre's traditional rivalry with Castile, offering trade concessions and safe passage through Granada for Navarrese merchants. The pitch: Granada as a useful buffer against Castilian expansion.\n\n\nTo Morocco (Abu Said Uthman III): The most desperate plea—immediate military intervention, vassalage offered, shared Islamic obligation emphasized. \"If Granada falls, who is next? Will you face the Castilian crusade alone?\"\n\n\nThe embassies departed between April 8-10th. The Sultan knew they were long shots, but paralysis had ended—finally, he was doing something.\n\n\n\nOrders to the Fortresses\n\n\nAlongside the diplomatic initiatives, military orders finally went out—though slow and confused due to disrupted communications:\n\n\nAll fortresses: Resist to the best of your ability. No surrenders without direct authorization from Granada.\n\nPriority: Hold Íllora and Loja—they guard the approaches to Granada city itself.\n\nPeripheral positions: Do what you can with available resources. No reinforcements can be sent.\n\n\nThe orders were clear enough, but everyone understood the subtext: You're on your own. Hold out as long as possible. We cannot help you.\n\n\n\nThe Results (Mid-April)\n\n\nBy April 15th, responses began filtering back:\n\n\nFrom Aragon: A polite letter from Alfonso V expressing sympathy for Granada's situation but firmly declining involvement. \"We cannot interfere in a Papal crusade undertaken by our brother-in-law for the defense of Christendom. The matter is in God's hands.\"\n\n\nFrom Portugal: An even more pointed refusal from João I. \"We will not undermine our son-in-law's holy mission against the enemies of Christ. Granada's appeals find no sympathy here.\"\n\n\nFrom Navarre: A terse message: \"Navarre has no strategic interest in Granada's survival. We wish you well, but can offer nothing.\"\n\n\nFrom Morocco: No response yet. The journey takes longer, and even if aid is promised, it would be weeks—perhaps months—before troops could arrive.\n\n\n\nThe Alhambra, April 16th\n\n\nSultan Muhammad IX sat alone in his private chambers overlooking the gardens. The diplomatic offensive had failed completely. The court's paralysis had burned five precious days before he could even launch it. Now the Christians were besieging Íllora, holding Vélez-Málaga, and advancing methodically through his kingdom.\n\n\nHe had perhaps 6,000 troops scattered across dozens of positions. The Castilians had over 30,000.\n\n\nA servant entered quietly. \"Your Majesty, the council is assembled. They await your presence for evening prayers and deliberations.\"\n\n\nThe Sultan rose slowly. More debates. More recriminations. More paralysis, probably.\n\n\nBut what choice did he have? The alternative was to simply surrender, and his pride—and his court's—wouldn't allow it. Not yet. Not while Granada's walls still stood.\n\n\nHe walked toward the council chambers, where two dozen advisors waited to argue about what could not be changed.\n\n\nOutside, the setting sun painted the Sierra Nevada mountains gold and red—beautiful and indifferent to the doom approaching from the north.\n\n\n\nStrategic Summary - Granada's Position, Mid-April 1431:\n\n\nMilitary: Effectively broken. No field army. Fortresses on their own.\n\nDiplomatic: Complete failure. No foreign aid coming.\n\nPolitical: Sultan survives but authority damaged. Court paralyzed and fractious.\n\nMorale: Shattered by Alcalá disaster and mass conversions.\n\nStrategy: Defensive only. Hold fortresses as long as possible and hope for... something.\n\n\nThe Emirate of Granada is dying. The only question is how long the death takes."

      "say": "Thought process: Synthesized Granada's paralysis, failed diplomacy, and guerrilla resistance narrative.\n\nThe user wants a summary from Granada's perspective that incorporates all the rolls:\n1. Sultan's position: Severe Crisis - Paralysis (27)\n2. Sultan's response strategy: Diplomatic Offensive - Exploit Christian Divisions (82)\n3. Diplomatic success: Minimal Response - Polite Refusals (19)\n4. Broader Granada response: Guerrilla Campaign Launched (19)\n5. Guerrilla effectiveness: Moderate Success - Real Disruption (53)\n\nSo the narrative is:\n- Granada court paralyzed after Alcalá disaster\n- Sultan eventually acts with diplomatic offensive\n- Diplomacy completely fails\n- But military commanders take initiative and launch guerrilla campaign\n- Guerrilla campaign has moderate success - real disruption but not game-changing\n\nThis should be written from Granada's perspective - their fears, their desperation, their small victories amid catastrophe. Show both the paralysis/failure and the glimmers of resistance.\n\n\nGranada's Response: April 3-25, 1431 — A View from the Alhambra\n\n\n\nThe Days of Ash (April 3-7)\n\n\nWhen the survivors staggered back through the gates, Granada knew. Not from official reports or royal proclamations, but from the faces of the men—hollow-eyed, haunted, silent. Of sixteen thousand who marched north in righteous jihad, fewer than three thousand returned.\n\n\nThe Alhambra became a tomb of recriminations. For five days, the court tore itself apart. The Sultan sat in council chambers while qadis screamed about divine judgment, while military commanders blamed each other, while imams debated whether God had abandoned Granada or was merely testing the faithful. Every session devolved into chaos. No decisions emerged. No orders went out.\n\n\nIn the city below, panic spread. Merchants began hiding their wealth. Families with means quietly prepared to flee. The faithful gathered at mosques, praying for deliverance that seemed increasingly unlikely.\n\n\nThe Sultan—young, traumatized, desperate—could barely impose his will on the fractured court. When he finally did speak with authority on April 7th, it was to grasp at diplomatic straws.\n\n\n\nThe Failed Gambit (April 8-15)\n\n\nFour embassies departed Granada between April 8-10th, bearing the Sultan's desperate appeals:\n\n\nTo Aragon: \"Remember our ancient friendship. Do you want Castile to dominate all Iberia?\"\n\n\nTo Portugal: \"Protect your daughter. Intercede for honorable peace.\"\n\n\nTo Navarre: \"We can be your buffer against Castilian expansion.\"\n\n\nTo Morocco: \"If we fall, you face the crusade alone.\"\n\n\nThe court watched the roads, waiting for salvation that would never come.\n\n\nBy April 15th, the responses arrived—polite, sympathetic, and utterly useless:\n\n\nAlfonso V of Aragon: \"We cannot interfere in a Papal crusade.\"\n\n\nJoão I of Portugal: \"We will not undermine our son-in-law's holy mission.\"\n\n\nJuan II of Navarre: \"Navarre has no strategic interest in Granada's survival.\"\n\n\nMorocco: Silence. Nothing but the wind.\n\n\nThe Sultan read the letters in his private chambers and understood: Granada stood alone.\n\n\n\nThe Riders in the Dawn (April 10-25)\n\n\nWhile the court debated and diplomats traveled fruitlessly, the surviving cavalry commanders took matters into their own hands.\n\n\nCommander Yahya ibn Malik—a grizzled veteran who'd fought at Alcalá and barely escaped—gathered what remained of Granada's light cavalry. Perhaps eight hundred riders: Moroccan survivors, Granadan professionals, men who'd covered the Sultan's retreat and lived to tell of it.\n\n\n\"We cannot win battles,\" he told them bluntly. \"We cannot hold fortresses forever. But we can make the Christians bleed. We can make them afraid to leave their camps. We can make every mile they advance cost them.\"\n\n\nThe riders knew the terrain intimately—every valley, every hidden path, every place where a convoy might be ambushed. They split into small parties of ten to fifty men, fast-moving and deadly.\n\n\nWeek One (April 10-17):\n\n\nThe first raids were tentative, testing Christian defenses. A foraging party of twenty Castilians disappeared near the road to Íllora—their bodies found days later, stripped of weapons and armor. A supply convoy escorted by fifty men was ambushed in a narrow valley; fifteen Christians killed, wagons burned, the rest fleeing in panic.\n\n\nThe Castilians strengthened their patrols. The raiders adapted, striking at dawn or dusk, appearing from nowhere and vanishing like smoke.\n\n\nWeek Two (April 18-25):\n\n\nThe campaign intensified. Granadan cavalry became bolder, more coordinated:\n\n\nA major supply convoy bound for the siege at Íllora was struck by three raiding parties simultaneously—sixty riders hitting from multiple angles. Twenty-eight Castilians killed, three wagons destroyed, siege equipment damaged. The raiders lost eleven men but considered it a victory.\n\nForaging became nearly impossible without heavy escorts. Christian soldiers refused to venture far from camp without at least fifty armed companions. Food supplies at the siege lines began running short.\n\nMessengers between armies were hunted systematically. At least six couriers were intercepted and killed, their dispatches never reaching their destinations. Juan II's headquarters lost contact with the eastern army for nearly a week.\n\nA daring night raid on the periphery of the Íllora siege camp resulted in thirty Christian casualties and the burning of a supply depot. The raiders vanished before the garrison could respond effectively.\n\n\nBy late April, the pattern was clear: The roads were no longer safe. Christian supply lines bled constantly. The siege of Íllora—which should have been progressing steadily—had stalled for lack of provisions and equipment.\n\n\nCastilian commanders were forced to divert hundreds of troops to convoy escort duty and road security. The crusade's momentum, so overwhelming after Alcalá, had slowed to a crawl.\n\n\n\nThe Accounting (Late April)\n\n\nIn the Alhambra's military council, Yahya ibn Malik delivered his report to a court that had begun to find its footing again:\n\n\nCastilian Casualties Inflicted: 180-200 killed, perhaps 100 more wounded\nSupply Convoys Hit: 7 ambushed, 3 completely destroyed\nMessengers Intercepted: 8-10 confirmed kills\nStrategic Impact: Íllora siege delayed 2-3 weeks, Christian advance slowed significantly\n\n\nGranada's Cost: 140 cavalry killed, perhaps 30 more wounded and out of action\n\n\nThe Sultan listened carefully. For the first time since Alcalá, he saw something other than despair in his commanders' eyes.\n\n\n\"This won't save us,\" Yahya said bluntly. \"They still have thirty thousand men. We have perhaps six thousand scattered across the kingdom. But we can make them pay for every fortress. We can buy time. We can show them that Granada still has teeth.\"\n\n\nThe Sultan nodded slowly. \"Continue. Coordinate with the fortress commanders. Every day we delay them is a day closer to... something. Moroccan aid. Weather turning. Anything.\"\n\n\nNo one believed it. But it was better than the paralysis of the previous two weeks.\n\n\n\nGranada's Reality (End of April 1431)\n\n\nMilitary Situation:\n\n\nField army: Destroyed (2,800 survivors, only 1,500-2,000 combat effective)\n\nWestern forces: Scattered (2,000 troops, Vélez-Málaga lost)\n\nGarrison troops: 3,000-4,000 across all fortresses\n\nGuerrilla cavalry: 650-700 remaining (after casualties)\n\nTotal: ~7,000-8,000 troops to defend entire kingdom\n\n\nStrategic Position:\n\n\nÍllora under siege (delayed but will fall eventually)\n\nVélez-Málaga held by Christians\n\nEastern and western fronts both under pressure\n\nSupply lines disrupted but not broken\n\nNo field army capability\n\nNo realistic hope of foreign aid\n\n\nPolitical Situation:\n\n\nSultan's authority damaged but holding\n\nCourt no longer paralyzed but deeply divided\n\nDiplomatic isolation complete\n\nPopulation frightened but not yet broken\n\n\nMorale:\n\n\nCatastrophic defeat at Alcalá haunts everyone\n\nMass conversions create theological crisis\n\nBut guerrilla successes provide small hope\n\n\"We can still fight\" sentiment emerging\n\nPride mixed with despair\n\n\nOutlook:\nGranada cannot win. Everyone knows this. The mathematics are brutal: 7,000 defenders vs 35,000 crusaders with Papal backing, naval superiority, and God's apparent favor.\n\n\nBut they can resist. They can make the Christians pay in blood and time for every fortress. They can preserve some dignity in defeat. They can hope that somewhere, somehow, something might change—though none can say what.\n\n\nThe guerrilla campaign won't save Granada. But it proves the emirate isn't dead yet. Not quite.\n\n\nIn the streets of Granada city, people still pray five times daily. They still believe, or try to. And on the roads leading north, Castilian soldiers now look over their shoulders, knowing that death might come from any shadow.\n\n\nIt's not victory. But it's not surrender either.\n\n\nNot yet.\n\n\n\nThe View from the Alhambra's Tower\n\n\nSultan Muhammad IX stands alone at sunset, looking north toward the Sierra Nevada. Somewhere beyond those mountains, the Christian king commands an army that will eventually reach these walls.\n\n\nBut not today. Not this week. Perhaps not for months, if the raids continue.\n\n\nTime. That's all Granada has left to buy. Time, and the small, bitter satisfaction of making the infidels bleed for every step.\n\n\nIt will have to be enough."

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed diplomatic expansion beyond Morocco amid crisis.\n\nThis is a good question about what the Sultan does next. We've established:\n\n1. Initial diplomatic offensive to Christian powers failed completely (rolled 19 - polite refusals)\n2. Court was paralyzed initially but is now functioning somewhat better\n3. Guerrilla campaign having moderate success, buying time\n4. Sultan sent embassy to Morocco but no response yet (too early)\n\nThe question is: Does the Sultan now reach out to OTHER Muslim powers beyond Morocco?\n\nThis is realistic - when facing existential crisis, you try everything. The initial roll (19) was about reaching out to CHRISTIAN powers. This would be a separate initiative reaching out to the broader Muslim world.\n\nLet me think about what's realistic:\n- Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt - powerful, but far away and dealing with their own issues\n- Ottoman Empire - rising power but focused on Balkans/Anatolia, very far from Iberia\n- Hafsid dynasty in Tunisia - closer, but weak\n- Various North African powers\n\nThe Sultan already sent to Morocco in the initial diplomatic offensive. Now that Christian diplomacy failed, would he cast a wider net to the Muslim world?\n\nI think this deserves a d100 table to determine:\n1. Does he try this broader outreach?\n2. If so, who does he contact?\n3. What's the timeline/likelihood of success?\n\nActually, I think the user is asking me to assess whether this happens, not roll for it yet. Let me give an analysis first.\n\n\nAnalysis: Will Sultan Muhammad IX Reach Out Beyond Morocco?\n\n\nGiven the circumstances, this is not just likely—it's almost certain. Here's why:\n\n\nFactors Pushing for Broader Outreach:\n\n\nChristian diplomacy completely failed - The polite refusals from Aragon, Portugal, and Navarre make clear no help is coming from that direction\n\nMorocco hasn't responded yet - It's been 2+ weeks since that embassy departed, and no word. Even if they agree, it could be months before troops arrive\n\nTime is running out - Fortresses under siege, coasts breached, guerrilla campaign only buying weeks\n\nIslamic solidarity appeal - Granada can frame this as broader threat to Islam: \"If Iberia falls, who's next?\"\n\nCourt pressure - Even if Sultan doubts success, the court will demand he \"try everything\"\n\n\nRealistic Targets:\n\n\nMamluk Sultanate (Egypt/Syria) - Most powerful Muslim state, but very far away and dealing with internal issues\n\nOttoman Empire - Rising power but focused on Balkans/Anatolia, even farther\n\nHafsid Dynasty (Tunisia) - Closer geographically, but weak\n\nVarious Maghreb emirates - Smaller North African powers\n\n\nThe Reality:\n\n\nYes, the Sultan will almost certainly send embassies to these powers, particularly the Mamluks. It's desperate, the chances of meaningful help arriving in time are virtually zero, but doing nothing guarantees defeat.\n\n\nShould we roll for:\n\n\nWhether he sends these embassies? (Almost certain yes)\n\nWhich powers he contacts specifically?\n\nWhat kind of response (if any) he receives?\n\nTimeline for any potential aid?\n\n\nWhat would you like to explore?"

The Sultan received money earlier - let me check what he had available initially and what this new funding represents.\n\nFrom the earlier results, with \"Moderate Support - Moroccan Commitment\":\n- 2,000-2,500 Moroccan troops sent in multiple waves\n- First contingent (800) arrives in 6-7 weeks (so late May/early June)\n- Financial aid: 60,000-80,000 dinars from various sources\n- Mamluk Sultanate sends weapons, armor, military supplies\n- Tunisia sends small naval squadron (3-5 ships)\n\nNow, can he recruit mercenaries with this money? Absolutely yes! This is medieval warfare - mercenaries are a standard solution. The question is:\n\n1. Where can he recruit them from?\n- North Africa (Berber/Moroccan mercenaries)\n- Local Spanish/Iberian mercenaries (though less likely given crusade context)\n- Mediterranean mercenaries (Italian, Greek, etc.)\n- Other Muslim regions\n\n2. How many can he get for 60,000-80,000 dinars?\n- Need to consider medieval mercenary rates\n- Quality vs quantity tradeoff\n- Time to recruit and transport them\n\n3. How quickly can they arrive?\n- Recruitment takes time\n- Transport takes time\n- Probably similar timeline to Moroccan troops (4-8 weeks)\n\nThis is a realistic and important strategic option. Granada has money but no troops - buying troops makes perfect sense. Should create a d100 table for:\n- How successful is mercenary recruitment?\n- How many troops does he get?\n- What quality are they?\n- How quickly do they arrive?\n\nLet me frame this properly for the user.\n\n\nExcellent strategic thinking - Yes, absolutely he can recruit mercenaries!\n\n\nThis is exactly what a medieval ruler in his position would do. He has:\n\n\n60,000-80,000 dinars from Muslim powers\n\nWhatever remaining treasury Granada still has\n\nDesperate need for troops immediately\n\n\nMercenary Options Available:\n\n\nNorth African mercenaries (Berber warriors, unemployed soldiers)\n\n\nClosest geographically\n\nCombat-experienced\n\nCan arrive relatively quickly (3-6 weeks)\n\nMediterranean mercenaries (Italian condottieri, Greek soldiers, Catalan companies)\n\n\nProfessional but expensive\n\nMight be reluctant to fight Papal crusade\n\nLonger recruitment time\n\nMuslim volunteers/mercenaries from across Maghreb\n\n\nMix of religious fervor and payment\n\nVariable quality\n\nFaster recruitment (religious motivation)\n\nLocal Iberian mercenaries\n\n\nSome exist but risky (loyalty questionable in crusade)\n\nCheapest and fastest but lowest quality\n\n\nShould we create a d100 table for:\n\n\nHow successful is his mercenary recruitment campaign?\n\nHow many mercenaries does he get for ~70,000 dinars?\n\nWhat quality/effectiveness are they?\n\nTimeline for their arrival?\n\n\nThis could significantly change Granada's military situation - he might be able to field 1,500-3,000 mercenaries within 4-8 weeks, combined with the Moroccan reinforcements.\n\n\nWant to roll for this?"

      "say": "Thought process: Reconciling financial records and scrutinizing Granada's treasury reserves.\n\nThe user is asking me to determine how much money the Sultan of Granada actually has available. I need to search the project files for:\n\n1. Any financial aid Granada received when the crusade was declared\n2. The 5,000 Moroccans commitment - this seems different from what we just rolled (which was 2,000-2,500 troops). Let me search for earlier references.\n3. Granada's treasury size/wealth\n4. The 60,000-80,000 dinars from the current roll\n\nLet me search the project knowledge for Granada's finances, treasury, and any earlier support.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Cataloging Granada's financial influx from Muslim allies.\n\nLet me search for Granada's specific treasury information and the total support they received.\n\nFrom the search results:\n1. **Initial Muslim Support (September 1430):**\n   - Morocco: 50,000 dinars\n   - Tunisia: 30,000 dinars\n   - Egypt (Mamluks): 100,000 dinars\n   - Ottomans: 20,000 dinars\n   - Various other sources: ~20,000 dinars\n   - **Total: 220,000 dinars**\n\n2. **Granada's own treasury:**\n   - Lost 80,000 dinars to failed mobilization\n   - But they had that 80,000 to spend, suggesting a substantial treasury\n   - Annual surplus appears to be significant if 220,000 dinars was \"more than annual surplus\"\n   - So annual surplus might be ~150,000-200,000 dinars\n   - A wealthy medieval state would have 2-3 years of surplus in reserve typically\n   - So treasury might have been 300,000-500,000 dinars before the crusade\n\n3. **Current roll (Moderate Support):**\n   - 60,000-80,000 dinars from various Muslim sources\n   - 2,000-2,500 Moroccan troops coming\n\n4. **Timeline:**\n   - Initial support: September 1430\n   - Battle of Alcalá: April 1, 1431 (7 months later)\n   - Current time: Mid-April 1431\n\nSo Granada has received:\n- 220,000 dinars (September 1430)\n- Minus 80,000 spent on failed mobilization\n- Plus whatever remained in treasury (let's say ~300,000-400,000 dinars conservatively)\n- Minus campaign expenses for 7 months (maintaining 16,000 troops, fortifications, etc.)\n- Plus 60,000-80,000 dinars (April 1431)\n\n\nI'll break down the potential expenditures and remaining funds. Campaign costs for 16,000 troops over 7 months would be substantial - estimated at around 120,000-150,000 dinars. Fortification and supply expenses might add another 50,000-70,000 dinars. This means they've likely spent between 170,000-220,000 dinars during this period. Factoring in their initial treasury and new support, they probably retain approximately 250,000-350,000 dinars for continued military operations.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Synthesized financial projections to estimate Granada's mercenary hiring capacity.\n\nGood, now I have the information I need. Let me calculate Granada's financial situation:\n\n**Initial Resources (September 1430):**\n- Granada's treasury: Not explicitly stated, but they spent 80,000 dinars on failed mobilization, suggesting they had at least 200,000-300,000 dinars in reserve (a wealthy state would have 2-3 years surplus). Let's estimate conservatively: 250,000 dinars\n- Muslim support received: 220,000 dinars\n- Total: ~470,000 dinars\n\n**Expenditures (September 1430 - April 1431, 7 months):**\n\nLooking at Castile's budget for comparison:\n- Castile's 8-month campaign costs 143,171 florins for 35,000 troops\n- Granada maintained ~16,000 troops (professionals + militia + incoming support)\n- Granada's costs would be roughly: (16,000/35,000) × 143,171 = ~65,400 florins equivalent\n- But Granada had to:\n  - Pay for the failed mobilization: 80,000 dinars already spent\n  - Maintain defenses and fortifications\n  - Feed the Moroccan troops arriving (5,000-6,000 by March)\n  - Conduct operations\n  \nLet me estimate Granada's spending over 7 months:\n- Failed mobilization: 80,000 dinars (already spent)\n- Maintaining 8,000 professional troops for 7 months: ~40,000-50,000 dinars\n- Supporting 5,000-6,000 Moroccans for ~4 months: ~20,000-25,000 dinars\n- 8,000 militia for 7 months: ~25,000-30,000 dinars\n- Fortifications and supplies: ~20,000 dinars\n- The disastrous campaign (Sultan's march): ~30,000 dinars\n\n\n- Total spending: ~215,000-235,000 dinars\n\nI've calculated the financial breakdown, revealing Granada's robust economic position. Despite significant military expenditures, they maintain a substantial financial cushion. The kingdom's initial resources of 470,000 dinars, combined with ongoing support, provide remarkable fiscal flexibility. After extensive spending, they still retain around 315,000 dinars - a considerable sum that enables strategic military options, including potential mercenary recruitment.\n\n\nAnalyzed data\n\n\n// Calculate Granada's Financial Situation (April 1431)\n\n// INITIAL RESOURCES (September 1430)\nconst initialTreasury = 250000;

Let me review what they have from the project files and my calculations:\n\nFrom earlier:\n- Existing forces after Alcalá disaster: ~6,500-7,000 troops scattered (survivors + garrison troops)\n- Guerrilla cavalry: ~650-700 riders (after casualties from raids)\n- Moroccan reinforcements from the moderate support roll: 2,000-2,500 troops arriving over 8-10 weeks\n\nNew mercenaries: 3,000-4,000 (let's say 3,500 as middle value)\n\nLet me break this down properly:\n\n**Existing Granada Forces (April 1431):**\n- Alcalá survivors: ~1,500-2,000 combat effective (of 2,800 who returned)\n- Western frontier forces: ~2,000 troops\n- Fortress garrisons scattered: ~3,000-4,000\n- Active guerrilla cavalry: ~650-700\n- Total existing: ~7,150-8,700 troops\n\n**Moroccan Support (arriving gradually):**\n- 2,000-2,500 professional troops\n- Arriving over 8-10 weeks (starting around Week 4-5)\n\n**New Mercenaries (arriving gradually):**\n\n\nI'll break down the 3,500 mercenaries into their specific composition:\n- North African troops: ~1,575 experienced fighters with some cavalry\n- Muslim volunteers: ~1,050 motivated religious warriors\n- Mediterranean professionals: ~875 skilled and expensive troops\n\nThe force composition reflects a strategic mix of experienced and motivated fighters, providing Granada with a diverse and capable mercenary contingent. These troops will gradually integrate with existing forces, bolstering Granada's military capabilities during a critical period of recovery and potential conflict.\n\nBy mid-May (Week 5), the initial mercenary arrivals start to make a significant impact:\n- Around 700 mercenaries have landed\n- First Moroccan contingents of 400-500 troops join\n- Total force grows to approximately 8,750-9,850 troops\n\nBy late May (Week 7), the reinforcements continue to strengthen the army:\n- Mercenary numbers increase to ~1,650\n- Moroccan troops reach ~1,000-1,200\n- Total force expands to 10,300-11,500 warriors\n\nMid-June (Week 10) sees substantial troop accumulation:\n- Mercenaries now number ~2,750\n- Moroccan forces grow to 1,800-2,200\n- Total force reaches 12,200-13,600, accounting for some cavalry casualties\n\nBy mid-July (Week 14), Granada consolidates its military strength:\n- Mercenaries fully deployed at ~3,500\n- Moroccan troops complete arrival at 2,000-2,500\n- Total force potential reaches 13,100-14,600 troops\n\nI can strategically concentrate these forces to field a robust army of approximately 13,000-15,000 troops.\n\n\nGranada's Consolidated Army -

What does Álvaro think about their strategic position given the news from the western front (moderate success at Vélez-Málaga)?\n2. What happens to the crusade treasury once they win?\n\nÁlvaro would assess:\n- Western front: Solid success but not spectacular (Vélez-Málaga taken, asking for orders)\n- Eastern front: Alcalá fallen, conversions, Íllora under siege but delayed by guerrilla activity\n- Overall momentum good but not overwhelming\n- Granada's response unknown to them yet (they don't know about mercenary recruitment or Moroccan reinforcements coming)\n\nOn the treasury question - this is interesting. The crusade has Papal backing and significant funds. What happens to leftover money? Does it go back to the Pope? Stay with Castile? Get used for next phase?\n\nÁlvaro would be pragmatic and strategic about both questions. He'd assess the military situation realistically and have thoughts on the financial/political situation.\n\nLet me write Álvaro's response in character - experienced, thoughtful, politically astute.\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down the dispatches and considers your questions carefully, his expression thoughtful.\n\n\n\"Our position? Solid, Your Majesty, but not overwhelming.\" He taps the letters. \"Estúñiga has done well—Vélez-Málaga is a real prize. A fortified port in our hands, Granada's eastern coast breached. But it's one fortress. Málaga itself is the true objective, and that will be a much harder fight.\"\n\n\nHe moves to the map on the table, tracing the frontiers.\n\n\n\"The eastern front concerns me more. The Master of Calatrava is besieging Íllora, but these guerrilla raids are slowing everything. We're bleeding—not catastrophically, but steadily. Supply convoys hit, messengers killed, foraging parties ambushed. It's the smart move for Granada—they can't beat us in the field, so they make the roads bleed us instead.\"\n\n\nHe straightens, meeting your eyes.\n\n\n\"We have momentum from Alcalá, but momentum can be lost. If these raids continue for months, if Íllora takes too long to fall, if Granada finds ways to prolong every siege...\" He shakes his head. \"We could win every battle and still exhaust ourselves before reaching Granada city. That's their strategy, and it's working better than I'd like.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then continues more carefully.\n\n\n\"As for the crusade treasury...\" Álvaro's expression becomes shrewd. \"That's a delicate question. Technically, the funds are designated for the crusade—the conquest of Granada. Once Granada falls, the crusade is complete. What happens then depends on how things are... documented.\"\n\n\nHe glances toward the door, lowering his voice slightly.\n\n\n\"Capranica will expect a full accounting. Any unspent funds, by strict ecclesiastical law, should return to Rome or be designated for 'continuing crusade purposes'—which Rome interprets broadly. But...\" He smiles thinly. \"If the funds are properly spent on crusade-related activities—garrisoning conquered territory, fortifying new borders, maintaining order in Granada, resettling Christian populations—then they're legitimate expenses.\"\n\n\n\"The question becomes: when does the crusade end? When Granada city falls? When the last fortress surrenders? When the territory is fully pacified? That could take years, Your Majesty. And during those years, the crusade treasury continues to fund operations.\"\n\n\nHe meets your gaze directly.\n\n\n\"My advice? Spend what you need to win decisively. Don't hoard funds. But also document everything meticulously—every florin toward the crusade's success. When Granada falls, there will be substantial 'transition costs' that are entirely legitimate. Capranica will audit, but if the documentation is sound, he can't object.\"\n\n\nHe leans back. \"Any surplus that clearly isn't needed? That's when Rome expects its due. But how much is 'clearly not needed' for securing and integrating an entire conquered emirate? That's... debatable.\"\n\n\nWhat do you think about his assessment?"

The Sultan's disastrous decision at Alcalá has accelerated the timeline dramatically.\n\nÁlvaro would understand this political calculation immediately. The crusade gives Juan:\n- Moral authority (Papal backing)\n- Military authority (commanding armies)\n- Financial authority (crusade taxation)\n- Unity among nobles (common cause)\n- Church support\n\nIf it ends too quickly, he loses these advantages before fully consolidating his rule over the fractious nobility.\n\nÁlvaro would also correct Juan's assessment about it going \"too well\" - the guerrilla campaign and Granada's reinforcements (which Juan doesn't fully know about yet) mean the crusade is actually entering a more difficult phase.\n\nJuan also corrects Álvaro about the crusade treasury - the bull defines when the crusade ends (Te Deum in Granada, all mosques converted to churches, Muslims expelled/converted). So there's less room for creative interpretation than Álvaro suggested.\n\n\nÁlvaro's eyebrows rise slightly at your correction about the bull's terms, then he nods. \"You're right, of course. The Te Deum in the Alhambra, every mosque converted, the Muslims dealt with. That's the clear endpoint.\" He pauses. \"Though 'dealing with' the Muslim population could still take considerable time and resources...\"\n\n\nBut then he focuses on your real point, and his expression becomes thoughtful, almost calculating.\n\n\n\"Going too well.\" He repeats the phrase, understanding immediately what you mean. \"You wanted more time operating with crusade authority.

The nobles return to their estates. The Military Orders return to their autonomy. The extraordinary taxation stops. And you're back to managing the same fractious kingdom you inherited, just with more territory to govern.\"\n\n\nHe drums his fingers on the table.\n\n\n\"But Your Majesty, I wouldn't worry about this crusade ending too soon. Not anymore.\" He taps the dispatches about the guerrilla raids. \"These aren't desperate bandits—this is organized resistance. And we don't yet know what other surprises Granada has prepared. The Sultan may have made one catastrophic mistake, but he's not giving up.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"A quick, easy conquest would have been politically inconvenient for your long-term goals. But I suspect Granada is about to make this campaign much longer and bloodier than Alcalá suggested. Which gives you time.\"\n\n\nHis smile is grim. \"Careful what you wish for, Your Majesty.\""

Juan wants to use the crusade's momentum to fundamentally reform Castilian taxation and break the great houses' stranglehold on revenues. This is extremely ambitious and risky.\n\nLet me think through Álvaro's perspective:\n\n1. **The Opportunity**: Crusade momentum, Papal backing, military success, Juan's authority at its height, nobles can't easily rebel during a crusade without looking like traitors to Christendom\n\n2. **The Risks**: \n   - Great houses will resist fiercely - this threatens their fundamental power\n   - Timing is tricky - crusade going \"too well\" means less time to implement\n   - If crusade stalls badly after this, nobles might blame the distraction\n   - Could fracture the coalition during active war\n\n3. **Support Base**:\n   - Some great houses (maybe 35-40% pro-Juan)\n   - Most smaller nobility (want fair treatment)\n   - Cities (hate noble tax exemptions)\n   - Church (already paying crusade taxes)\n   - BUT: 15-20% hostile nobles, 40-45% neutral/opportunistic\n\n4. **The Proposal**:\n   - New standardized taxation\n   - Strip ancient exemptions and outdated assessments\n   - Compensation via Granada estates or money\n   - Do it NOW while winning but still fighting\n\nÁlvaro would see both the opportunity and the danger. He's ambitious and understands this is a once-in-a-generation chance, but he's also pragmatic about risks.\n\nHis response should:\n- Acknowledge the brilliance and audacity of the timing\n- Point out the risks honestly\n- Suggest how to structure it for maximum success\n- Probably support it but with careful conditions\n- Be excited about the possibility but realistic about execution\n\n\nÁlvaro goes very still, his eyes sharpening with intense focus. For a long moment he just stares at you, and you can almost see his mind racing through calculations.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" He stands abruptly, begins pacing. \"That's... ambitious doesn't even begin to describe it. You want to use the crusade—while it's still active, while you still have emergency authority—to fundamentally restructure Castile's entire tax system and break the nobility's ancient privileges.\"\n\n\nHe stops pacing, turns to face you directly.\n\n\n\"It's brilliant. And terrifying. And it might actually work.\"\n\n\nHe comes back to the table, leaning on it with both hands.\n\n\n\"The timing is perfect in some ways. You're at the height of your authority—crushing victory at Alcalá, Papal backing, leading a holy war. The nobles can't easily oppose you without looking like they're sabotaging the crusade. The smaller nobility and cities would support you enthusiastically—they've been getting squeezed by those same exemptions for generations. The Church is already paying crusade taxes, so they're invested.\"\n\n\nHe straightens. \"But Your Majesty, this will provoke the great houses like nothing else. You're not just asking them to contribute to a war—you're permanently stripping rights they've held for centuries. Even houses that support you personally might balk at this. It threatens the foundation of their power.\"\n\n\nHe considers carefully. \"Here's how you might make it work:\n\n\nFirst, the framing is everything. Don't call it 'new taxes.' Call it 'rationalization of revenues for the crusade and the kingdom's defense.' Make it about efficiency, about fairness, about ensuring Castile can defend itself after Granada falls. Emphasize that ancient privileges made sense two hundred years ago but Castile faces new threats—and needs a modern revenue system.\n\n\nSecond, the compensation must be real and generous. Granada estates for those who want land. Monetary compensation for those who prefer gold. Maybe even hereditary titles for houses that cooperate willingly. Make supporting you profitable—more profitable than clinging to old exemptions.\n\n\nThird, structure it as a council decision, not a royal decree. Summon a council—call it a 'Council of the Crusade' or something. Get the smaller nobles, the cities, the Church to support it vocally. Make the great houses choose: support the consensus or stand alone against the kingdom's needs during a holy war.\n\n\nFourth, implement it gradually but irreversibly. Start with assessments—just accurate counting, who can object to that? Then 'temporary' crusade rates that become permanent. Then consolidation of ancient rights into 'equivalent' new arrangements. Each step small enough not to trigger rebellion, but the sum total is transformation.\n\n\nFifth—and this is critical—you need the crusade to last at least another year. If Granada collapses in three months, you lose the justification. But if the crusade grinds on through 1431 and into 1432...\" He spreads his hands. \"Then you have time to make the changes stick before anyone can challenge them effectively.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"The danger is this: if you announce this and then the crusade goes badly—if Granada's resistance stiffens, if we suffer a major defeat, if the campaign stalls—the nobles will blame this 'distraction.' They'll say you weakened the crusade by picking a fight with your own nobility during wartime.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"But if you wait until after Granada falls, you lose all leverage. The emergency ends, the nobles go home, and they have time to organize opposition.\"\n\n\nHis expression becomes fierce. \"So yes, Your Majesty. I think this is possible. I think the timing is as good as it will ever be. But you need to structure it carefully, compensate generously, and pray that Granada gives us at least another year of fighting to make it permanent.\"\n\n\nHe leans back. \"When do you want to summon this council?\""

How does this compare to the crusade taxation (5% of revenue)?\n3. Whether to start by just taxing nobles according to their TRUE revenue as a first step\n\nThis is a smart political strategy - start with something that sounds reasonable (just accurate assessment) before moving to higher rates.\n\nLet me search the project files for information about noble taxation rates.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Disambiguated feudal versus crusade taxation structures and their assessment bases.\n\nThe user is asking about normal noble taxation rates. From the project files, I can see:\n\n1. **Current System:**\n- Nobles SHOULD pay 10-15 million maravedís annually based on their wealth\n- They ACTUALLY pay only 2-3 million maravedís\n- The gap is 8-12 million lost\n\n2. **How they avoid it:**\n- Ancient privileges and exemptions\n- Outdated land assessments (from 1311!)\n- Simply don't pay what they legally owe\n- Charge for military service that should be free\n\n3. **The crusade taxation:**\n- 5% of actual revenue\n- 2,000 maravedí exemption for 4 months personal service\n\nBut the user is asking: what is the NORMAL taxation rate on nobles (not crusade taxation)?\n\nFrom the context, it seems like:\n- Nobles should pay feudal obligations (feudal rents and payments)\n- But the rate isn't clearly specified as a percentage\n- It's more based on ancient feudal contracts and assessments\n- The problem is they're using 119-year-old assessments (from 1311)\n\nSo it seems like there isn't a standard \"percentage\" for normal noble taxation - it's based on feudal obligations calculated from ancient (outdated) land assessments.\n\nThe crusade tax is NEW and different - it's 5% of actual current revenue.\n\nLet me respond appropriately to clarify this distinction.\n\n\nÁlvaro pauses, then shakes his head slightly.\n\n\n\"That's the problem, Your Majesty—there isn't a standard 'normal taxation' rate on nobles. Not really.\"\n\n\nHe stands and moves to explain more clearly.\n\n\n\"The current system is based on ancient feudal obligations—specific rents and payments tied to individual land grants, most dating back a century or more. A noble house might owe, say, 5,000 maravedís annually based on a charter from 1311. But that assessment was done when the land was worth 50,000 maravedís. Now it's worth 500,000 maravedís, but they still only pay based on the old valuation.\"\n\n\nHe taps the table for emphasis.\n\n\n\"So effectively, they're paying perhaps 1-2% of their actual revenue in 'normal' taxes. The great houses—the ones with estates worth 400,000-500,000 maravedís annually—they might pay 5,000-10,000 maravedís. That's barely 2%.\"\n\n\nHe continues: \"The crusade tax at 5% is more than double what they currently pay. And it's based on actual current revenue, not century-old fiction. That's why the assessment program is so critical—we need real numbers.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro leans forward. \"So your question about starting gradually by just taxing nobles according to their true revenue at current rates... Your Majesty, that's brilliant. Because you're not even raising the rate—you're just applying the same feudal obligations to reality instead of fantasy.\"\n\n\nHe thinks through the politics. \"Here's how you could frame it:\n\n\nPhase One (1432): 'We're not imposing new taxes. We're simply updating the assessments to current values and collecting what nobles already owe under existing feudal contracts. This is just accurate accounting.'\n\n\nPhase Two (1433): 'Now that we have accurate numbers, let's rationalize the system. Some pay 1%, some pay 3% under the old patchwork. Let's make it fair—everyone pays 3-4% based on actual revenue.'\n\n\nPhase Three (1434+): 'The kingdom's needs have grown. We're raising the standard rate to 5-6% to maintain defenses and administration.'\n\n\nEach step sounds reasonable in isolation. But combined, you've gone from nobles paying 1-2% to 5-6%—tripling or quadrupling their tax burden—and you did it 'gradually.'\"\n\n\nHe smiles grimly. \"The crusade tax at 5% becomes the new baseline. After the crusade ends, you don't lower it back to the old rates—you keep it as the new permanent rate. The crusade established the precedent that 5% is reasonable and the kingdom can assess accurately.\"\n\n\n\"Does that answer your question?\""

Juan is thinking ahead about how to structure the new estates in Granada. This is his opportunity to establish a modern, rational system from scratch without dealing with ancient privileges.\n\nLet me think about what would be historically appropriate and strategically smart:\n\n1. Historical context: In medieval times, feudal obligations varied wildly, but typically included:\n   - Direct taxes/rents to the lord (could be 10-20% of production for peasants, but nobles had different arrangements)\n   - Military service obligations\n   - Various fees and payments\n\n2. For noble estates granted as rewards:\n   - The crown needs revenue\n   - But nobles need enough income to maintain their status and military households\n   - Too high and you discourage people from wanting the land\n   - Too low and you lose revenue opportunity\n\n3. Strategic considerations for Juan:\n   - This is his chance to set a NEW standard\n   - Can make Granada estates MORE generous than old Castilian obligations to reward crusaders\n   - But should still extract reasonable revenue\n   - The new system becomes a model that pressures old nobility\n\nÁlvaro would likely suggest something like:\n- Make new Granada estates pay 3-4% (LESS than the 5% crusade tax)\n- This makes them attractive - \"Look, Granada nobles pay less than you old houses!\"\n- But it's still MORE than the 1-2% old houses currently pay\n- And it's based on ACTUAL revenue with no ancient exemptions\n- This creates pressure: \"Why should old estates pay less than new ones? Let's standardize at 3-4%\"\n\nThis is brilliant political strategy - use generous treatment of new estates to pressure old nobility to accept reform.\n\n\nÁlvaro's expression becomes very intent, recognizing the strategic importance of this question.\n\n\n\"This is where you have enormous leverage, Your Majesty. You're creating these estates from scratch—no ancient charters, no exemptions, no century-old assessments. You can structure them however you want.\"\n\n\nHe sits back, thinking through the implications.\n\n\n\"I would recommend making the Granada estates more generous than the reformed system you're imposing on old Castilian nobility. Perhaps 3-4% of actual revenue in perpetuity, with clear terms in the feudal contract.\"\n\n\nHe counts off the advantages on his fingers:\n\n\n\"First, it makes the Granada estates extremely attractive. Crusaders will fight harder knowing they're getting land with lighter obligations than the old nobility bears. A knight who earns a 50,000 maravedís estate in Granada pays 1,500-2,000 maravedís annually. That's excellent—he can afford a proper household, equipment, horses.\"\n\n\n\"Second, it creates political pressure on the old nobility. When a newly-created baron in Granada is paying 3-4% while the Duke of Medina Sidonia is still claiming he should only pay 1% based on a charter from 1311... it becomes indefensible. You can point to your own system and say: 'Look, even the estates I personally grant pay more than you ancient houses. How is this fair?'\"\n\n\n\"Third, it establishes a modern, rational standard. No exemptions. No special privileges. Just a clear percentage of actual revenue, assessed regularly. The Granada nobility becomes your model for what Castilian nobility should look like.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"Here's the political genius: You can tell the old nobility, 'I'm asking you to pay 5% during the crusade emergency, but look—the permanent rate for new estates in Granada is only 3-4%. Once we rationalize the system, you'll actually pay less than the crusade tax. All I'm asking is that you pay what the new nobles pay—no special treatment either way.'\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Of course, 3-4% of actual revenue is still double or triple what they currently pay. But it sounds reasonable when you frame it as 'the same as everyone else' and 'less than the temporary crusade rate.'\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's smile is calculating. \"And Your Majesty, here's the beautiful part: those Granada estates will generate substantial revenue for the crown. If you grant estates worth, say, 10-15 million maravedís in annual production over the next few years, even at 3-4% that's 300,000-600,000 maravedís annually from Granada alone. Pure profit—land that generated nothing for Castile before.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"So yes, 3-4% for new Granada estates. Generous enough to reward crusaders. High enough to generate real revenue. And strategically positioned to pressure old nobility into accepting similar rates.\"\n\n\n\"Does that approach make sense?\""

Let me think through this carefully.\n\nHistorical Context:\n- Medieval taxation varied enormously by region and time period\n- The Church traditionally claimed \"tithe\" = 10% of production/revenue\n- Most feudal obligations were much lower in practice (1-3%) due to outdated assessments\n- Peasants often paid much more (up to 30-50% total when you include all obligations)\n\nWhat would be considered \"fair\" in 1430s Castile:\n\n1. The 10% ecclesiastical rate is established and accepted\n2. Nobles paying 1-2% (effectively) is clearly too low\n3. But asking nobles to pay 10% would be revolutionary and possibly spark rebellion\n4. The middle ground matters\n\nArguments for different rates:\n\n**For 5-6%:**\n- Double current effective rates but not confiscatory\n- Leaves nobles wealthy enough to maintain military households\n- Similar to what other European kingdoms were moving toward\n- Politically achievable without rebellion\n\n**For 8-10%:**\n- Equal to what Church pays (fairness argument)\n- Biblical tithe precedent gives it legitimacy\n- Would dramatically increase crown revenue\n- But might be seen as excessive, could spark resistance\n\n**Historical Comparison:**\n- England in this period: nobles paid various rates, often 10-15% in total feudal obligations\n- France: nobles paid relatively little but provided extensive military service\n- Aragon: similar to Castile, low effective rates\n\nThe strategic calculation:\n- Juan wants to fundamentally reform the system\n- He needs it to be defensible as \"fair and just\"\n- He needs it to be politically achievable\n- He needs substantial revenue increase\n\nI think Álvaro would advocate for something like:\n- 5-7% as the standard \"fair\" rate for established nobility\n- This is a major increase but defensible\n- Could push toward 8-10% over time as new normal\n\n\n- The Church's 10% tithe provides a compelling moral and legal precedent for tax reform\n- It offers a benchmark of fairness that could justify gradual increases in noble taxation\n- This ecclesiastical model could be strategically leveraged to reshape the entire tax system\n\n\nÁlvaro goes very still, his eyes widening slightly as he processes the implications of your question.\n\n\n\"Ten percent...\" He says it slowly, almost reverently. \"The tithe. The biblical standard.\"\n\n\nHe stands and begins pacing, his mind clearly racing.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, that's... that's audacious. But there's genuine precedent for it.\" He counts off on his fingers:\n\n\n\"First, the Church has claimed ten percent for centuries as God's due. It's enshrined in scripture, in canon law, in everyone's understanding of what constitutes a 'fair share.' If the Church can claim ten percent of everyone's production for God's work, why can't the Crown claim ten percent for the kingdom's defense and governance?\"\n\n\n\"Second, the papal bull already establishes ten percent as legitimate—that's what church properties are paying for the crusade. Cardinal Capranica signed off on it. Rome accepted it. You have documentation that ten percent is a just and reasonable rate for supporting holy war.\"\n\n\n\"Third,\" and here he turns to face you directly, \"ten percent is actually quite moderate compared to what peasants and townsmen pay when you add everything up. Peasants pay the church tithe, plus rent to their lord, plus royal taxes, plus local dues—easily thirty to fifty percent of their production. Merchants pay the alcabala at ten percent plus customs plus guild fees. Why should great nobles pay less than everyone else?\"\n\n\nHe leans against the table, thinking through the politics.\n\n\n\"Here's how you could frame it as 'just and fair':\n\n\nThe Theological Argument: 'God asks ten percent for His church. The kingdom asks ten percent for the common defense and justice. Together, twenty percent supports both the spiritual and temporal needs of Christian society. This is ancient, biblical, and fair.'\n\n\nThe Equality Argument: 'The Church pays ten percent under the crusade bull. Why should secular nobles pay less than the bishops and abbots? Are not all estates equal before God and king?'\n\n\nThe Historical Argument: 'In older, simpler times, nobles contributed their service—months of campaigning, risking their lives. But now many hire others to fulfill their obligations while they remain at court. If they won't give their blood and time, they must give their gold. Ten percent is the price of shifting from service to payment.'\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then continues more carefully.\n\n\n\"But Your Majesty, there's a significant risk. Ten percent is high enough that it might unite the nobility against you—even those who support the crusade. They might accept five or six percent as a wartime necessity that becomes permanent. But ten percent... that's their rents, their lifestyle, their ability to maintain large households.\"\n\n\nHe thinks for a moment. \"Here's what I'd recommend:\n\n\nPhase One - The Crusade (1431-1433): Five percent crusade tax with the 2,000 maravedís exemption for personal service. Establish accurate assessments. Get them used to paying based on reality.\n\n\nPhase Two - Rationalization (1434): 'Now that the crusade is complete, let's establish a permanent, fair system. The Church pays ten percent. Nobles should pay... seven percent. Still less than the Church, but enough to maintain the kingdom we just expanded.'\n\n\nPhase Three - Full Reform (1435+): 'The costs of defending and administering Granada are higher than anticipated. We're raising the noble rate to match the ecclesiastical rate—ten percent. This achieves true equality before the law.'\n\n\nEach step sounds reasonable. Each step is small enough not to trigger rebellion. But the destination is ten percent.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes seriously.\n\n\n\"Alternatively, you could go for ten percent right from the start and justify it by the theological and equality arguments. It's risky—might spark serious resistance—but it has the advantage of being clean, clear, and defensible. 'We're not being greedy. We're asking nobles to pay what the Church pays. Nothing more, nothing less.'\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"So to answer your question: Yes, ten percent could absolutely be defended as 'just and fair.' It has biblical precedent, it matches what church lands pay, and it's actually moderate compared to other classes. The question is whether you can impose it politically without provoking rebellion.\"\n\n\n\"What's your instinct, Your Majesty?\""

He's right - nobles have military obligations that the church doesn't. This is a real counterargument to the 10% rate. Let me think through Álvaro's response:\n\n1. Álvaro should acknowledge this is a valid point\n2. But he should also explain the reality that many nobles are already avoiding/minimizing this obligation\n3. The modern trend is that nobles are increasingly hiring others or sending minimal forces\n4. There's a way to structure this that accounts for military service\n\nActually, this could be the key to the whole system:\n- Base rate could be higher (say 7-10%)\n- But with substantial credits/deductions for actual military service\n- This incentivizes the behavior Juan wants (active military nobility) while still getting revenue from those who don't serve\n\nThis is actually brilliant - it aligns the tax system with military obligations in a way that's fair and creates the right incentives.\n\n\nÁlvaro stops pacing immediately and nods, a look of genuine respect crossing his face.\n\n\n\"You're absolutely right, Your Majesty. That's a crucial distinction I glossed over too quickly.\"\n\n\nHe returns to the table, sitting down to think through this more carefully.\n\n\n\"Nobles have two primary obligations to the crown: treasure and service. The Church has only one: treasure. So asking them to pay the same rate ignores that nobles bear an additional burden—maintaining military households, providing armed levies, campaigning for months at a time.\"\n\n\nHe drums his fingers on the table thoughtfully.\n\n\n\"Here's how we could structure it to be genuinely fair:\n\n\nBase Rate: Seven to Eight Percent - Higher than the 5% crusade rate, but less than the Church's ten percent. This accounts for their military obligations.\n\n\nBut here's the key—make military service actually reduce the tax burden:\n\n\nActive Service Credits:\n\n\nFor every month of personal military service with the royal army, reduce annual tax by 500 maravedís\n\nFor every 100 men provided and maintained in royal service for a campaign, reduce annual tax by 2,000 maravedís\n\nMaximum reduction: up to half the total tax burden\n\n\nThis creates the right incentives. A baron with 50,000 maravedís income would owe 3,500-4,000 maravedís at 7-8%. But if he serves personally for four months and brings 200 men? He could reduce that by 2,000-6,000 maravedís. Suddenly military service is worth real money.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro leans forward, warming to the idea.\n\n\n\"This solves multiple problems:\n\n\nFirst, it's genuinely fair. Nobles who actually fulfill their military obligations pay less. Those who sit on their estates and send minimal forces pay more. The tax system rewards the behavior you want.\n\n\nSecond, it eliminates the current corruption where nobles claim military service fulfills their obligations but then charge the crown for that service. Now it's clear: either serve and get tax reduction, or pay full taxes and we'll hire professionals.\n\n\nThird, it gives nobles a choice. Rich old nobles who can't campaign anymore? Fine, pay the full rate. Young vigorous nobles who want to fight? Serve and save money. Everyone's satisfied because they chose their path.\n\n\nFourth, it addresses your concern about being fair to those with real obligations. A noble who campaigns for six months and brings 300 men could reduce his taxes substantially—maybe even eliminate them entirely if the credits are generous enough.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then adds: \"And Your Majesty, here's the political genius: You can increase the base rate over time while increasing the service credits. So the nominal rate goes from 7% to 8% to 9%, but nobles who serve actively don't feel it because their credits keep pace. The burden falls entirely on nobles who don't serve—which is exactly who should bear it.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"So to answer your revised question: No, nobles shouldn't pay the full ten percent that the Church pays. Seven to eight percent as a base rate, with substantial reductions for actual military service, is just and fair. It accounts for their dual obligations while still generating significant revenue and incentivizing the warrior culture you want to maintain.\"\n\n\n\"Does that strike the right balance?\""

He's thinking about the fundamental shift in Castile's strategic situation once Granada is conquered. This is actually quite prescient for 1431 - the historical shift toward naval power and Atlantic exploration did happen, though it took decades to fully materialize.\n\nLet me think through the implications:\n\n1. **Military Dynamic Shift:**\n- With Granada conquered, no major land threat on Iberian peninsula\n- Portugal is ally (through marriage)\n- Aragon is family (Alfonso V married to Juan's sister María)\n- France is distant across Pyrenees (natural barrier)\n- Navarre is small and manageable\n- This means the age-old Reconquista military structure becomes obsolete\n\n2. **Impact on Nobility:**\n- Traditional noble power based on: land, armed retainers, ability to field military forces\n- If crown doesn't need massive land armies constantly, noble military leverage decreases\n- Naval power requires different resources: ships, sailors, merchants, ports\n- Naval warfare is more centralized (king controls ports, shipyards) vs. decentralized (nobles control castles, lands)\n- This fundamentally shifts power toward crown and away from landed nobility\n\n3. **Economic Implications:**\n- Naval/maritime focus means: trade, exploration, colonies, merchant wealth\n- Wealth shifts from land rents toward commerce and trade\n- Cities and merchants become more important\n- Crown can tax trade (easier than land), control ports, grant monopolies\n- Less dependent on noble levies, more on professional navies/armies funded by trade\n\n4. **Historical Parallel:**\n- This is exactly what happened historically with Spain's pivot to Atlantic exploration and empire\n- Portugal did this even earlier\n- England did this successfully, reducing noble power while building naval supremacy\n- Venice, Genoa built wealth and power on naval/commercial strength\n\n5. **Juan's Insight:**\n- He's recognizing this shift EARLY (1431 vs. historical development over decades)\n- This is strategically brilliant - understanding that conquering Granada changes everything\n\n\n- Opens up entirely new avenues for crown power\n- Reduces reliance on nobility for security\n\nI see a profound transformation emerging. The conquest of Granada isn't just a military victory, but a strategic pivot that fundamentally restructures Castile's political and economic landscape. By dismantling the traditional military framework, the crown gains unprecedented opportunities to centralize power and reshape the kingdom's future.\n\n\nÁlvaro goes completely still, staring at you for a long moment. Then he slowly sits back down, his expression one of dawning realization.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" He speaks slowly, carefully. \"That's... I don't think anyone else in Castile is thinking about this yet. But you're absolutely right.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward, energized now.\n\n\n\"The entire structure of Castilian power—the whole reason the great houses have so much leverage—is based on the Reconquista. For seven centuries, the crown has needed them. Needed their castles, their armed retinues, their ability to field thousands of men at short notice. Because we faced constant threat of Muslim invasion, internal conflict, border warfare.\"\n\n\nHe gestures emphatically. \"But once Granada falls? Your Majesty, you'll have secured the entire peninsula except for tiny Navarre. Portugal is your ally—your wife's father. Aragon is your brother-in-law. The Pyrenees form a natural barrier against France. Where's the existential threat that requires fifty great nobles each maintaining private armies?\"\n\n\nHe stands, pacing now with excitement.\n\n\n\"The strategic shift is profound:\n\n\nLand Power vs. Naval Power:\n\n\nThe Mediterranean and Atlantic are where wealth and power will flow. Trade with the East. Exploration down the African coast—Portugal is already doing this profitably. Eventually... who knows? Perhaps routes to India, perhaps lands across the Ocean Sea. This requires ships, not castles. Professional sailors, not feudal levies. Merchants and shipyards, not nobles with armed retainers.\n\n\nCentralization of Military Power:\n\n\nNaval forces are inherently more centralized. You can't have forty different nobles each building their own war fleets from their castles. Shipyards are in royal ports. Fleets require coordination, supply chains, royal treasuries to fund them. The crown controls the coasts, the harbors, the customs houses. Naval power naturally flows to whoever controls these chokepoints—and that's you, not the nobility.\n\n\nEconomic Transformation:\n\n\nMaritime trade generates enormous wealth. More importantly, it's wealth the crown can tax easily. Ships pass through royal ports. Merchants need royal licenses. Trade goods can be taxed at customs houses. Compare that to trying to tax what a duke grows on his estates three hundred miles inland—he can hide production, claim poor harvests, intimidate your assessors. But a ship full of spices docking at Seville? That you can see and tax.\n\n\nChanged Military Requirements:\n\n\nYou'll still need an army, but a different kind. Not massive feudal levies you call up every summer. A smaller, professional, standing force funded by the treasury. Perhaps 5,000-8,000 professionals permanently maintained, supplemented by urban militias if needed. Enough to keep order, garrison key fortresses, respond to minor threats. The nobles' military contribution becomes... optional. Decorative, even.\"\n\n\nHe stops pacing, turning to face you seriously.\n\n\n\"Here's what this means for your taxation and reform strategy:\n\n\nThe Nobles Are Losing Their Primary Leverage:\n\n\nRight now they can threaten: 'Tax us too heavily and we won't provide troops.' But if you don't desperately need their troops anymore? If you can fund professional forces and navies from trade revenue? Their threat becomes empty. You can say: 'Fine, keep your men at home. We'll hire professionals. But you'll still pay your taxes.'\n\n\nNew Power Centers Emerge:\n\n\nCities with ports become critically important. Seville, Cádiz, Barcelona, Valencia, eventually wherever you develop Atlantic trade. The merchant class grows wealthy and influential. They'll support strong royal power because it protects trade, maintains order, enforces contracts. They're natural allies against noble privilege.\n\n\nFiscal Independence:\n\n\nIf you develop maritime trade successfully—and Portugal proves it's possible—royal revenue could come increasingly from customs, trade monopolies, colonial ventures. Less dependent on taxing noble estates. More dependent on controlling commerce. And commerce thrives under strong, centralized authority, not feudal fragmentation.\n\n\nMilitary Obsolescence:\n\n\nWithin a generation, the noble military establishment could be... quaint. Ceremonial. Great houses maintaining armed retainers because it's traditional, not because the crown needs them. Like keeping falconers when nobody hunts anymore. They become showpieces of a bygone era.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro sits back down, his expression intense.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, this is why your taxation reform is so perfectly timed. You're implementing it at the last moment when you still need them—during the Granada crusade, when their military service is genuinely valuable. You're locking in permanent taxation and assessment systems while they still feel obligated to cooperate.\n\n\nBut once Granada falls? Within ten to fifteen years, Castile's strategic needs will have completely shifted. The nobility will be paying 7-8% of their revenue in taxes, providing military service that's increasingly optional, while the real power flows through ports and trade routes they don't control.\n\n\nThey won't even realize what's happened until it's too late. They'll still be thinking like warriors and landowners in a world that's becoming about merchants and sailors.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"This is why Portugal is so important as an ally. They're ahead of us on this transformation. They've been pushing down the African coast for thirty years. They've built a naval and commercial empire without conquering huge territories. Their nobles are weaker, their king is richer, and their future is on the water. You can learn from them. Accelerate the process.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then asks carefully: \"Is this why you chose the Portuguese marriage? Were you thinking about this strategic shift even then?\""

This year (1431) we are assessing the estates true revenues. We could use the normal taxation in combination with crusade taxation to raise taxes to 8% of revenue but with substantial discounts if the nobles serve in the crusade and also if they provide levies. Large houses with a lot of levies could even be exempt from taxes altogether. This I dont mind as long as they agree to this structure and eventually make it permanent.\n\n\nIs this what you are proposing?"

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed immediate benefits against long-term structural vulnerabilities of proposed taxation scheme.\n\nJuan is thinking through a very practical approach here. Let me understand what he's suggesting:\n\n1. This year (1431): Assess estates' true revenues\n2. Combine \"normal taxation\" + crusade taxation to reach 8% of revenue\n3. BUT provide substantial discounts/credits for:\n   - Personal service in crusade\n   - Providing levies\n4. Large houses with lots of levies could be exempt entirely\n5. Get nobles to agree to this structure\n6. Make it permanent\n\nHe's asking if this is what Álvaro is proposing.\n\nI think Álvaro would see both the brilliance and the potential problems with this approach. Let me think through his response:\n\nPROS:\n- Gets accurate assessments (critical)\n- Establishes 8% as the \"normal\" rate\n- Rewards actual military service (good incentives)\n- Large houses that actually contribute heavily get rewarded\n- Might get buy-in from nobles who see they can reduce/eliminate taxes through service\n- Makes it permanent while crusade is ongoing\n\nCONS:\n- Large houses that provide many levies being totally exempt defeats much of the revenue purpose\n- Once Granada falls and military need decreases, those exemptions become problematic\n- In 10-20 years when naval power matters more, you'll have locked in exemptions for land-based military service\n- The whole point was to shift away from depending on noble levies\n\nÁlvaro would probably say: \"This is good for NOW, but we need to think about what happens AFTER Granada. We need the structure to adapt.\"\n\nHe might propose:\n- Yes to the 8% base rate with service credits\n- BUT cap the total reduction (can't go below, say, 3-4% no matter how much service)\n- OR make the service credits gradually phase down over time\n- OR tie exemptions specifically to \"crusade service\" which ends when crusade ends\n\nThe key insight is that Juan wants noble buy-in NOW by being generous with service exemptions, but Álvaro needs to think about the long-term structural implications.\n\n\nÁlvaro pauses, choosing his words carefully. He can see what you're thinking, but there's a concern in his expression.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I understand the logic—and it's politically shrewd for right now. Eight percent base rate, but reduce it substantially for service and levies. The great houses that actually contribute heavily might pay nothing or almost nothing. The houses that sit idle pay the full amount. It creates the right incentives for the crusade and gets noble buy-in.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward, speaking more carefully now.\n\n\n\"But here's my concern: You just explained that in ten to twenty years, we won't need those massive noble levies anymore. The strategic landscape shifts to naval power, professional armies, trade dominance. So if we make this structure permanent—with exemptions for providing levies—we're locking in exactly the system we want to move away from.\"\n\n\nHe taps the table for emphasis.\n\n\n\"Think about 1445. Granada is conquered. The crusade is over. Maritime trade is booming. You need professional sailors and a standing army, not feudal levies. But you've granted permanent exemptions to the Duke of Medina Sidonia because he provides 1,000 men to his levies. Except... you don't actually need those 1,000 men anymore. They're obsolete. But he's still exempt from taxes because of them.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro stands, thinking through alternatives.\n\n\n\"Here's what I'd propose instead—and it's only slightly different from your idea, but the difference matters:\n\n\nFor the Duration of the Crusade (1431-1433?):\n\n\nEight percent base rate\n\nGenerous service credits—exactly as you described\n\nLarge houses providing substantial levies could indeed be nearly exempt\n\nThis gets their buy-in and rewards actual contribution to the war effort\n\n\nBut when we make it permanent, structure it differently:\n\n\nSeven to eight percent base rate (established as 'normal' during crusade)\n\nService credits still exist BUT with a cap: No noble can reduce their obligation below, say, three percent no matter how much they serve\n\nOR: Service credits apply only during active military campaigns—when you actually summon the levies. No campaign, no credits, everyone pays the base rate\n\nOR: Service credits gradually phase down over a ten-year period after Granada falls, giving nobles time to adjust but ensuring the crown eventually gets full revenue\"\n\n\nHe sits back down. \"The genius of any of these approaches is that you're being honest: 'Yes, military service matters and will be rewarded. But the crown also has fiscal needs that must be met. Your service reduces but doesn't eliminate your obligations.'\n\n\nThis accomplishes several things:\n\n\nFirst, it's still attractive to nobles during the crusade. They can significantly reduce their taxes by serving—just not eliminate them entirely.\n\n\nSecond, it protects your future revenue. Even if the Duke of Medina Sidonia brings 1,000 men, he still pays at least 3-4% of his 450,000 maravedís income—that's 13,500-18,000 maravedís. Multiply that across forty great houses and you're talking millions in permanent revenue.\n\n\nThird, it adapts to the strategic shift. Once you stop needing their levies as much, you stop calling them up. No call-up means no service credits. The revenue naturally increases as your military needs change.\n\n\nFourth, it's defensible: 'We honor military service, but the kingdom has roads to maintain, justice to administer, borders to patrol. Some base level of taxation is simply necessary for any functioning state.'\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes directly.\n\n\n\"Your instinct is right—use the crusade to establish eight percent as normal, reward service generously, get noble buy-in by showing you value their contribution. But build in protection against the future scenario where you don't need their service anymore but still need their money.\n\n\nDoes that make sense? Am I being overly cautious about something fifteen years in the future?\""

      "say": "I did not say it explicitly, but I also meant exactly that: Only levies actually serving grant any tax exemption. So in peace time, everyone pays the 8% since we are not raising any levies.\n\n\nBut will the nobles not see this coming? If they think like: If the king does not raise any levies for ten years we all have to pay just 8%.\n\n\nLets take our inspiration from the crusade. The nobles pay this 8% into the treasury, but we earmark it into something like \"eternal crusade\", and keep this money seperate to fund future expansion into affrica or other targets. The money gets used to buy supplies for the armies and levies to go on future campains. If we attach ceuta for example, we call levies and hire ships with the money from this special fund. If we frame it right, we might even allocate some or all of the left over crusade treasury into this pot as well. This means that the taxes the nobles pay do not become my private property anymore. I dont mind that as long as it will be used to expand my kingdom. And the nobles get the same rights they always get in terms of spoils and estates in conquered territories.\n\n\nWhat do you think?"

      "say": "Thought process: Appraised Juan's ingenious taxation scheme and its political implications.\n\nThis is brilliant from Juan. He's proposing:\n\n1. 8% taxation rate on nobles\n2. Exemptions only for levies *actually serving*\n3. Earmark this 8% revenue into a permanent \"crusade fund\" or \"expansion fund\"\n4. Use it specifically for future military campaigns - Africa, perhaps other targets\n5. The money isn't \"royal treasure\" but a dedicated military expansion fund\n6. Nobles get traditional rights to spoils and estates from conquests\n7. Potentially roll leftover crusade treasury into this fund too\n\nThis is politically very clever because:\n- It frames the taxation as not enriching the king personally\n- It's for expansion/glory that nobles benefit from\n- It maintains the warrior culture and gives them continued opportunities\n- It's analogous to the crusade tax (special purpose) rather than general taxation\n- Nobles can see tangible benefit - more conquests = more estates for them\n\nÁlvaro should be impressed but also see some issues:\n- This is still a huge increase in permanent royal revenue\n- The \"special fund\" is still controlled by the crown\n- Once the money is in royal coffers, the distinction is somewhat artificial\n- But it's brilliant political framing\n- It also commits Castile to perpetual expansion\n- What happens when there are no more realistic targets?\n\nThis is actually a very historically plausible approach - many kingdoms had specific \"war chests\" or funds. The Ottoman Empire had similar arrangements.\n\n\nÁlvaro goes absolutely still, his eyes widening. For a long moment he just stares at you, then slowly a smile spreads across his face.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty... that's brilliant.\"\n\n\nHe stands up, animated now. \"You're not asking them to pay taxes to enrich the royal household. You're asking them to contribute to a permanent war chest—a fund dedicated to expansion and conquest that directly benefits them. It's not the king's money, it's the kingdom's military expansion fund.\"\n\n\nHe begins pacing excitedly.\n\n\n\"The political framing is perfect. You're essentially saying: 'The Reconquista doesn't end with Granada. It continues across the Strait into Africa. And beyond. This fund ensures we always have resources ready to seize opportunities—Ceuta, Tangier, perhaps the Canary Islands, eventually who knows where. You're not paying for my palaces, you're investing in future conquests where you gain estates, glory, and wealth.'\n\n\nThe advantages are enormous:\n\n\nFirst—Political Cover:\nNobles can't easily oppose it without looking like cowards or traitors. 'You oppose a fund for expansion? You don't want more Christian lands? You don't want opportunities for your sons to win estates and glory?' It frames resistance as unpatriotic.\n\n\nSecond—Continued Purpose:\nThe warrior nobility keeps its raison d'être. They're not becoming obsolete—they're the spearhead of perpetual expansion. Their military households, their training, their culture—all remain relevant because there's always another campaign on the horizon.\n\n\nThird—Tangible Benefits:\nEvery conquest funded by this pot generates new estates. Nobles see direct return on their 'investment.' A baron pays 4,000 maravedís annually into the fund. Five years later, his son wins an estate worth 50,000 maravedís in North Africa. That's a spectacular return.\n\n\nFourth—Fiscal Flexibility:\nThe money is technically earmarked, but Your Majesty, a 'military expansion fund' can cover a lot. Building ships? That's military expansion—you need navy for African campaigns. Training professional soldiers? That's expansion preparation. Fortifying ports? Critical for projecting power across the sea. The line between 'expansion fund' and 'general military budget' is... flexible.\"\n\n\nHe stops pacing, his expression more serious now.\n\n\n\"And here's the strategic genius: This commits Castile to perpetual expansion. Which means perpetual opportunities for nobles to gain wealth and status through service. Which means they stay invested in royal military ventures. Which means they keep supporting a strong, centralized military state—because that's what generates the campaigns they profit from.\n\n\nYou're creating a self-reinforcing system. The fund enables expansion. Expansion generates estates and glory. Estates and glory motivate nobles to keep supporting the fund. It's a cycle that strengthens the crown while giving the nobility exactly what they want—purpose and opportunity.\"\n\n\nHe sits back down, thinking through specifics.\n\n\n\"Now, the questions of implementation:\n\n\nNaming matters. Don't call it 'the Royal War Fund' or something dry. Call it something that evokes glory and crusade. The 'Perpetual Crusade Treasury'? The 'Fund for Christian Expansion'? The 'Royal Conquest Treasury'? Something that sounds noble and exciting.\n\n\nGovernance is crucial. Who controls the fund? Just you? You plus oversight committee? I'd recommend: You as Supreme Commander have full authority to spend it for military purposes, but there's an advisory council (including some trusted nobles) that reviews expenditures annually. This gives nobles symbolic oversight—they feel it's 'their' fund too—while you retain operational control.\n\n\nThe leftover crusade treasury is key. If you can roll, say, 200,000 florins from the current crusade into this new permanent fund, you're starting with a massive war chest. That proves the fund is real, well-resourced, and ready to act. It's not some theoretical future thing—it's operational immediately.\n\n\nDefine qualifying expenditures broadly. Military campaigns, obviously. But also: naval development, fortress construction in strategic locations, diplomatic missions to potential conquest targets, intelligence gathering, military training, shipbuilding, garrison maintenance in frontier regions, subsidies to Military Orders for expansion activities. Cast a wide net.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward intently.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, there's one potential problem: What happens in twenty years when you've conquered Ceuta, secured the Strait, maybe taken some Moroccan coastal cities, and there are no more realistic expansion targets? The fund keeps accumulating money every year. Do nobles start questioning why they're still paying into it?\n\n\nThe answer is: There are always targets. The Canary Islands. Atlantic exploration like Portugal. Supporting Christian forces in Italy if needed. Crusades in the East if the Pope calls. Naval expeditions against Barbary pirates. Fortifying the Mediterranean coast against Ottoman expansion. Frame it as 'maintaining readiness' and 'seizing opportunities wherever they arise.'\n\n\nAnd frankly, if you accumulate a massive surplus in the fund because there are no active campaigns... well, 'military preparedness' can justify a lot of spending. Professional armies don't exist without cost. Maintaining a powerful fleet isn't cheap.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes seriously.\n\n\n\"This is one of the most sophisticated pieces of political strategy I've seen, Your Majesty. You're increasing permanent royal revenue by 6-8 million maravedís annually, creating a mechanism for perpetual expansion, giving the nobility continued purpose and profit, and framing it all as serving the kingdom rather than enriching yourself personally.\n\n\nThe nobles won't just accept this—many will enthusiastically support it. Especially younger nobles looking for opportunities. The great houses might grumble about paying 8%, but when you point out their sons are winning estates in Africa with that money, they'll shut up.\n\n\nWhen do you want to propose this? At the end of the 1431 campaign season, when you summon that council?\""

Let them digest the idea during winter, discuss it among themselves, come to see the advantages. Then formalize it at Cortes in 1432 when they've had time to consider.\"\n\n\nHe thinks through the approach. \"Here's how I'd structure it:\n\n\nThis Year (Late 1431): Summon an informal council—call it the 'Council of Victory' or something celebratory—after the campaign season ends. Perhaps in Toledo or Seville. Present the idea as a proposal, not a decree. Frame it as: 'We've achieved great success against Granada. Now let's think about how to ensure Castile continues expanding. Here's a concept I want your thoughts on...'\n\n\nGet their reactions, hear their concerns, let them feel consulted. Some will support immediately. Others will be cautious. But you've planted the seed.\n\n\nNext Year (1432): Call formal Cortes. By then, you'll know which nobles support the idea and which need more convincing. You'll have refined the proposal based on feedback. And you'll have—God willing—completed or nearly completed the Granada conquest, which proves the model works. 'Look what we accomplished with coordinated funding and noble service. Now let's make it permanent.'\n\n\nThe delay also lets you demonstrate fiscal responsibility. Show that the crusade treasury was managed well, funds were used properly, the system works.\"\n\n\nHe shifts to your second point.\n\n\n\"As for writing His Holiness... Yes, absolutely. This news will delight him.\" Álvaro's expression becomes more serious. \"Pope Martin V is elderly—he must be nearly seventy now. Ill, from what we hear. This might be one of his last great triumphs. A letter announcing the crushing victory at Alcalá, the fall of fortresses, the mass conversions... Your Majesty, this validates everything he invested in your crusade.\"\n\n\nHe considers the content. \"What should you include?\n\n\nThe Military Success:\n\n\nBattle of Alcalá: Sultan's army destroyed, 10,000+ enemy casualties\n\nAlcalá la Real fortress surrendered\n\nVélez-Málaga taken on the coast\n\nMultiple other fortresses under siege\n\nGranada's military power broken\n\n\nThe Conversions:\nThis is what will truly move him. Seventy Muslim warriors renouncing Islam after witnessing the battle, choosing baptism freely, joining the crusade. The theological implications—that God's favor was so evident even the enemy recognized it. Frame this as proof of divine backing.\n\n\nThe Sacred Banner:\nMention how it was carried into battle, how it inspired the troops, how the True Cross relic led the crusade to victory. Rome needs to know their sacred gifts were used and honored.\n\n\nThe Challenge Ahead:\nBe honest that Granada is resisting with guerrilla warfare, that foreign Muslim support is arriving, that the campaign will take time. But express confidence with God's help.\n\n\nThe Request:\nPerhaps... ask for His Holiness's continued prayers and blessing? And—this is subtle—mention that the crusade's success suggests potential for further Christian expansion across the Strait into Africa. 'The work of defending and expanding Christendom continues beyond Granada.' Plant the seed for future justification.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro pauses. \"Should you mention the Perpetual Crusade Fund concept to Rome? It's risky—Capranica will report on it anyway, but if you frame it first, you control the narrative. You could present it as: 'The success of this crusade shows the value of dedicated, permanent funding for Christian expansion. I propose establishing a perpetual treasury to continue the work after Granada falls.'\"\n\n\nHe shrugs. \"Rome might love it—shows you're committed to continued crusading. Or they might worry you're creating a military slush fund outside their oversight. Your call whether to mention it now or wait.\"\n\n\n\"When do you want to send this letter?

Not forced, not coerced, but a genuine crisis of faith resolved by conversion.\"\n\n\nHe begins pacing. \"Ahmad can testify personally before the Pope and cardinals about what he saw. The theological implications of watching an Islamic army blessed by every imam in Granada simply... erased by God. The mass conversions that followed. His own journey from doubt to faith. Your Majesty, this is the kind of story the Church lives for. Proof that the crusade has divine backing, that even Muslim scholars recognize the truth when confronted with it.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro's expression becomes more thoughtful. \"And the journey itself—weeks traveling together from Castile to Rome. Fray Hernando teaching Ahmad deeper Christian theology. Ahmad sharing his Islamic scholarship, his perspective on the Reconquista from the other side. They'll arrive in Rome not just as envoy and convert, but as genuine companions who've had profound theological discussions.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, considering practicalities. \"A few things to arrange:\n\n\nSafety Concerns: Ahmad is a new convert traveling through Christian lands. He'll need clear documentation—letters bearing your seal and Capranica's, identifying him as under royal protection, a valued member of your court, traveling on official business. Any harassment of him is harassment of the king's messenger.\n\n\nInstructions for Ahmad: He should speak honestly about his experience and conversion, but perhaps remind him to be... diplomatic about certain matters. Rome doesn't need to hear every doubt or question he still has. Focus on what he witnessed, what convinced him, his sincere desire to learn more about Christianity.\n\n\nLetters of Introduction: Beyond the official correspondence, give them personal letters to Cardinal Capranica's associates in Rome, to key Vatican officials. 'This is my spiritual advisor and a Muslim scholar who has joined our cause. Receive them with honor.'\n\n\nThe Presentation: When they arrive, Fray Hernando presents the official military report. Then Ahmad is introduced—not just as a convert, but as a witness. He saw everything at Alcalá. He can describe the theological crisis it created for Granada's faithful. He's living proof that the crusade is achieving spiritual victories, not just military ones.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro sits back down. \"Your Majesty, this will have enormous impact. When word spreads through Rome that a Muslim qadi has converted and traveled to pay respects to the Pope, it becomes a story. Artists will paint it. Chroniclers will write about it. It validates the entire crusade in ways a simple military report never could.\"\n\n\nHe thinks for another moment. \"One concern: Ahmad's safety in Rome itself. Some might view him with suspicion—a former Muslim in the heart of Christendom. But with Fray Hernando as his companion and protector, with clear royal backing, with Capranica's associates watching over them... he should be safe. And honestly, I think Rome will be fascinated by him. Cardinals will want to meet him, hear his story, debate theology with him.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"When should they depart? The army can spare Fray Hernando for a few months, surely. And Ahmad... this journey might actually deepen his faith. Seeing Rome, the churches, the art, the devotion—it could cement his conversion in ways that staying in a military camp never would.\"\n\n\nWhat do you want to tell them before they leave?"

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated comprehensive chapter narrative spanning military, diplomatic, and political developments.\n\nThe user wants me to create a comprehensive summary of Chapter 17 in a canvas document. Let me organize all the major events that happened in this chat:\n\n1. Opening - Day after Battle of Alcalá (April 2, 1431)\n   - Juan consolidates and rests at Alcalá la Real\n   - Visits wounded, including Martín de Oviedo\n\n2.

Western Army dispatches\n   - Rolled for western operations (26 - Moderate Success)\n   - Vélez-Málaga taken after 4-6 days siege\n   - 58 dead, 94 wounded total\n   - Estúñiga requests orders\n\n6. Granada's Response to Catastrophe\n   - Rolled (27 - Severe Crisis/Paralysis)\n   - Court paralyzed with debates\n   - Sultan's authority damaged but survives\n\n7. Sultan's Strategy\n   - Rolled (82 - Diplomatic Offensive)\n   - Sends missions to Aragon, Portugal, Navarre, Morocco\n   - Rolled for success (19 - Minimal Response/Polite Refusals)\n   - All diplomatic efforts fail\n\n8. Granada's Broader Response\n   - Rolled (19 - Guerrilla Campaign Launched)\n   - 500-800 light cavalry organized\n   - Rolled for effectiveness (53 - Moderate Success)\n   - 180-200 Castilians killed, supplies disrupted\n   \nThe siege of Íllora faces a 2-3 week postponement, with Granada suffering 140 fatalities. Financial calculations reveal approximately 300,000 dinars in available funds, enabling the potential recruitment of 4,000-7,000 mercenaries. Moroccan support emerges with a commitment of 2,000-2,500 troops, providing a modest but crucial reinforcement to Granada's military capabilities.\n\nMuslim allies contribute additional financial aid and resources, including Mamluk advisors, weapons, and supplies. Mercenary recruitment yields a moderate success, bringing in 3,000-4,000 professional fighters from North Africa, Mediterranean regions, and Muslim volunteer networks. These troops will arrive in stages between weeks 5-14.\n\nBy mid-July 1431, Granada assembles a consolidated army of 13,700-14,500 troops, combining existing forces, Moroccan reinforcements, and new mercenaries. Despite this effort, they remain significantly outnumbered, facing a 2.4:1 disadvantage against Castilian forces.\n\nThe strategic situation grows complex, with the Master of Calatrava besieging Íllora using 15,000 troops, while Enrique commands a 5,000-strong reserve at Alcalá. Guerrilla raids continue to challenge Granada's position, prompting Juan to order Estúñiga to consolidate defenses at Vélez-Málaga.\n\nCrusade objectives extend beyond military conquest, targeting religious transformation through church conversions and Muslim expulsion. Juan shows nuanced concern about the campaign's rapid progress, seeking to leverage crusade powers for broader systemic reforms.\n\nTax restructuring emerges as a critical strategic lever. Current noble taxation sits at 1-2% of actual revenue, with the crusade tax at 5%. Proposed permanent rates range from 7-8%, incorporating military service credits. New Granada estates would face a 3-4% permanent taxation rate.\n\nCastile's strategic vision pivots from territorial expansion to maritime dominance. The nobility's traditional strategic influence diminishes as maritime trade becomes the primary revenue generator. A perpetual crusade fund concept takes shape, proposing an 8% permanent noble tax earmarked for future territorial expansion in Africa and beyond.\n\nThe campaign's ideological momentum crystallizes in a letter to Pope Martin V, highlighting military successes, conversion efforts, and a personal commitment to continuing the crusading mission beyond Granada's borders.\n\n\nI'll create a comprehensive summary document for Chapter 17 in canvas.\n\n\nChapter 17: Consolidation and Strategy - Complete Summary\n\n\n# Chapter 17: Consolidation and Strategy - Complete Summary\n## April 2-10, 1431\n\n---\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nChapter 17 marks the strategic aftermath of the crushing victory at Alcalá la Real. While the eastern army consolidates and begins the siege of Íllora, Juan returns to Jaén to coordinate between three separate military forces. The chapter encompasses military consolidation, Granada's desperate responses, long-term strategic planning with Álvaro de Luna, and the conceptualization of a revolutionary taxation and expansion framework that could transform Castile for generations.\n\n---\n\n## PART I: CONSOLIDATION AT ALCALÁ LA REAL (April 2, 1431)\n\n### Morning After the Battle\n\nThe fortress of Alcalá la Real shows the grim aftermath of victory:\n- Fields carpeted with Moorish dead (bodies being processed)\n- Medical stations overflowing with wounded from both sides\n- ~1,500-1,700 Castilian casualties total (400-500 dead, rest wounded)\n- Granada suffered 10,000+ casualties\n- Army desperately needs rest after forced march and battle\n\n**Key Forces Present:**\n- 23,000 troops total (minus casualties = ~21,300 combat-effective)\n- 70-140 Muslim converts beginning instruction with Fray Hernando\n- Ahmad al-Zarqali joining royal court as advisor\n- Yusuf ibn Rashid and son as military advisors\n\n### Conversation with Infante Enrique\n\nJuan meets with his cousin to discuss the battle:\n- Enrique held siege works with 5,000 men\n- Enemy arrived exhausted, barely fighting\n- Enrique lost only ~30 men holding prepared positions\n- Strange battle—more like butchery than combat\n- Enemy collapsed from exhaustion before serious engagement\n\nJuan describes leading two cavalry charges:\n- First charge smashed wavering infantry\n- Moroccan cavalry fought back professionally both times\n- Real cavalry combat—brutal, fast, close-quarters\n- Guardian knight Martín de Oviedo wounded saving Juan's life\n- First experience of true battlefield violence for Juan\n\n**Strategic Discussion:**\n- Juan rejects rushing toward Granada (risk of being cut off)\n- Decides to methodically take fortresses\n- Master of Calatrava to advance with 15,000 toward Íllora\n- 5,000 remain at Alcalá under Enrique as reserve\n- Juan and Álvaro return to Jaén to coordinate\n\n### Visit to Martín de Oviedo\n\nJuan visits the wounded guardian who saved his life:\n- Martín fevered, neck/shoulder wound from mamluk blade\n- Two daughters (María 14, Isabel 12) in Toledo with aunt\n- Wife died three years ago\n- Martín asks Juan to care for daughters if he dies\n- Juan promises to look after them\n\n**Survival Roll: 5 -

Sweep east toward smaller coastal targets\n\nFleet in good condition, morale high, awaiting command.\n\n---\n\n## PART V: GRANADA'S RESPONSE TO CATASTROPHE\n\n### The Alhambra - Days of Ash (April 3-7)\n\n**Survivors Return:**\n- Fewer than 3,000 of 16,000 who marched\n- Hollow-eyed, haunted, silent\n- No official proclamations needed—faces told the story\n\n**Court Paralysis (Roll: 27 - Severe Crisis, Paralysis):**\n- Five days of chaos and recriminations\n- Qadis screaming about divine judgment\n- Military commanders blaming each other\n- Imams debating if God abandoned Granada\n- No decisions, no orders, complete paralysis\n- Sultan young, traumatized, unable to impose will\n\n**Theological Crisis:**\n- Mass conversions at Alcalá create existential questions\n- \"Perhaps we have been wrong. Perhaps God does not favor Granada.\"\n- Faith crisis spreading through survivors\n- Qadi Ahmad al-Zarqali's testimony particularly striking\n\n### The Failed Diplomatic Gambit (April 8-15)\n\n**Sultan's Strategy (Roll: 82 - Diplomatic Offensive, Exploit Christian Divisions):**\n\nFour embassies dispatched April 8-10:\n\n**To Aragon (Alfonso V):**\n- Emphasize historical Granada-Aragon cooperation\n- Offer territorial concessions, trade privileges\n- 20,000 gold dinars for \"mediation services\"\n- Appeal: \"Do you want Castile to control all Iberia?\"\n\n**To Portugal (João I):**\n- Play on family ties (Princess Isabel)\n- Request intercession for \"honorable peace terms\"\n- Emphasize protecting Isabel from crusade dangers\n\n**To Navarre (Juan II):**\n- Emphasize traditional Navarre-Castile rivalry\n- Offer trade concessions\n- Suggest Granada as useful buffer against Castilian expansion\n\n**To Morocco (Abu Said Uthman III):**\n- Most desperate plea—immediate military intervention\n- Vassalage offered\n- Shared Islamic obligation emphasized\n- \"If Granada falls, who is next?\"\n\n**Diplomatic Success Roll: 19 - Minimal Response, Polite Refusals**\n\n**Responses (April 15):**\n- **Aragon:** \"Cannot interfere in Papal crusade\"\n- **Portugal:** \"Will not undermine son-in-law's holy mission\"\n- **Navarre:** \"No strategic interest in Granada's survival\"\n- **Morocco:** No response yet (journey longer)\n\nComplete failure. Granada stands alone.\n\n### Granada's Military Response (April 10-25)\n\n**Broader Response Roll: 19 - Guerrilla Campaign Launched**\n\nWhile court paralyzed, surviving cavalry commanders act:\n- Commander Yahya ibn Malik gathers ~800 remaining light cavalry\n- Moroccan survivors, Granadan professionals, rearguard veterans\n- Split into parties of 10-50 riders\n- \"We cannot win battles, but we can make them bleed\"\n\n**Guerrilla Effectiveness Roll: 53 - Moderate Success, Real Disruption**\n\n**Week One (April 10-17):**\n- Tentative raids testing Castilian defenses\n- Foraging party of 20 disappeared near Íllora\n- Supply convoy of 50 escorts ambushed—15 killed, wagons burned\n- Castilians strengthen patrols, raiders adapt\n\n**Week Two (April 18-25):**\n- Major supply convoy struck by three parties simultaneously\n- 28 Castilians killed, 3 wagons destroyed, siege equipment damaged\n- Foraging requires heavy escorts (50+ men)\n- At least 6 messengers intercepted and killed\n- Night raid on Íllora siege camp—30 casualties, supply depot burned\n- Communications disrupted for nearly a week\n\n**Results by Late April:**\n- Castilian casualties: 180-200 killed, ~100 wounded\n- Supply convoys hit: 7 ambushed, 3 completely destroyed\n- Messengers intercepted: 8-10 confirmed\n- Strategic impact: Íllora siege delayed 2-3 weeks\n- Granada casualties: 140 cavalry killed, ~30 wounded\n- Roads no longer safe\n- Hundreds diverted to convoy escort/security\n\n**Granada's Perspective:**\nWon't save them, but proves Granada \"still has teeth.\" Buys time. Shows they can still fight.\n\n---\n\n## PART VI: GRANADA'S FINANCIAL SITUATION AND MERCENARY HIRING\n\n### Treasury Analysis (Using Calculation Tool)\n\n**Initial Resources (September 1430):**\n- Granada Treasury: 250,000 dinars\n- Muslim Support Received: 220,000 dinars\n- Total: 470,000 dinars\n\n**Expenditures (September 1430 - April 1431):**\n- Failed Mobilization: 80,000 dinars\n- Professional Troops (7 months): 45,000 dinars\n- Supporting Moroccan Forces (4 months): 23,000 dinars\n- Militia Forces (7 months): 28,000 dinars\n- Fortifications & Supplies: 20,000 dinars\n- Disastrous Campaign Costs: 30,000 dinars\n- Miscellaneous Operations: 15,000 dinars\n- **Total Spent: 241,000 dinars**\n\n**Current Position (Mid-April 1431):**\n- Remaining: 229,000 dinars\n- New Muslim Support (Roll 68): 70,000 dinars\n- **Total Available: ~300,000 dinars**\n\n### New Muslim Support (Roll: 68 - Moderate Support, Moroccan Commitment)\n\n**Morocco Fully Committed:**\n- 2,000-2,500 troops sent in multiple waves\n- First contingent (800) arrives Week 6-7\n- Rest follow over 3-4 months\n- Professional Moroccan infantry and elite cavalry\n\n**Financial Aid:**\n- 60,000-80,000 dinars from various Muslim sources\n- Morocco primary contributor\n- Tunisia, Egypt, others providing funds\n\n**Military Support:**\n- Mamluk Sultanate: 200 elite mamluks + military advisors\n- Tunisia: Small naval squadron (3-5 ships)\n- Weapons, armor, military supplies from multiple sources\n\n**Strategic Impact:**\nSignificantly extends Granada's resistance. Campaign becomes much costlier for Castile. May hold through 1431 into 1432.\n\n### Mercenary Recruitment Campaign\n\n**Sultan's Decision:** Maximum deployment—spend 150,000-200,000 dinars\n- His kingdom at stake\n- Willing to pay premium rates\n- Recruiters to North Africa, Mediterranean, across Muslim world\n- Keep ~100,000-150,000 dinars reserve\n\n**Mercenary Success Roll: 43 - Moderate Success, Decent Force**\n\n**Results: 3,000-4,000 mercenaries hired**\n\n**Composition:**\n- 45% North African veterans (1,575 troops): Experienced Berber infantry and cavalry\n- 30% Muslim volunteers (1,050 troops): Variable quality, high motivation (jihad)\n- 25% Mediterranean professionals (875 troops): Italian/Greek mercenaries, siege specialists\n\n**Quality:** Average to good overall\n**Cost:** 140,000-170,000 dinars\n\n**Arrival Timeline:**\n- Week 5: First 600-800 arrive (North Africans)\n- Week 7: 1,500-1,800 arrived\n- Week 10: 2,500-3,000 arrived\n- Week 14 (Mid-July): Full force assembled\n\n### Granada's Consolidated Army (Mid-July 1431)\n\n**Total Force: 13,700-14,500 troops**\n\n**Breakdown:**\n1. **Existing Forces: ~7,500**\n   - Alcalá survivors (reorganized): 1,800\n   - Western frontier forces: 2,000\n   - Fortress garrisons (concentrated): 3,000\n   - Active guerrilla cavalry: 600-650\n\n2. **Moroccan Reinforcements: 2,200-2,500**\n   - Professional infantry: 1,800-2,000\n   - Elite cavalry: 400-500\n\n3. **New Mercenaries: 3,500**\n   - North African: 1,575 (900 infantry, 475 cavalry, 200 specialists)\n   - Muslim volunteers: 1,050 (800 infantry, 250 cavalry)\n   - Mediterranean professionals: 875 (500 infantry, 200 cavalry, 175 specialists)\n\n**By Type:**\n- Heavy Infantry: 5,500-6,000\n- Light Infantry: 5,000-5,500\n- Heavy Cavalry: 800-900\n- Light Cavalry: 1,800-2,000\n- Specialists/Support: 600-700\n\n**Quality Distribution:**\n- Elite (10%): ~1,400 (Moroccan elite, Mediterranean professionals, best guerrillas)\n- Good (35%): ~4,800 (North African mercenaries, Moroccan regulars, veterans)\n- Average (40%): ~5,600 (Garrison troops, many volunteers)\n- Poor (15%): ~2,100 (Green volunteers, demoralized militia)\n\n**Force Comparison:**\n- Castile: ~33,300 troops (21,300 east + 12,000 west)\n- Granada: ~14,000 troops (by mid-July)\n- **Ratio: 2.4:1 in Castile's favor**\n\n**Granada's Capabilities:**\n- Can defend major fortresses effectively\n- Can conduct limited offensive operations\n- Enough cavalry for effective raiding\n- Can sustain extended campaign\n- **Cannot win pitched battles against full Castilian army**\n- Must choose which positions to defend\n- Treasury will exhaust by late fall (~15,000-20,000 dinars/month mercenary costs)\n\n**Strategic Reality:**\nGranada has a *real army* again. Not enough to win, but enough to make the crusade extremely costly and potentially stall it. The Sultan has bought time and created genuine military options.\n\n---\n\n## PART VII: STRATEGIC DISCUSSION WITH ÁLVARO DE LUNA\n\n### Initial Assessment\n\nÁlvaro evaluates Castilian position:\n- Western front: Solid—Vélez-Málaga secured, but Málaga itself is the prize\n- Eastern front: Concerning—guerrilla raids slowing everything\n- Momentum exists but can be lost\n- Granada pursuing smart strategy: bleed supply lines, prolong sieges\n- Risk of winning every battle but exhausting before reaching Granada city\n\n### Crusade Treasury Discussion\n\n**Juan's Question:** What happens to crusade funds after victory?\n\n**Álvaro's Response:**\n- Technically funds designated for crusade conquest\n- Once Granada falls, crusade complete\n- Capranica will expect full accounting\n- Unspent funds should return to Rome by strict law\n- BUT: \"Crusade-related activities\" definition is flexible\n  - Garrisoning conquered territory\n  - Fortifying new borders\n  - Maintaining order in Granada\n  - Resettling Christian populations\n- Question: When does crusade end?\n  - When Granada city falls?\n  - When last fortress surrenders?\n  - When territory fully pacified?\n  - Could take years\n\n**Álvaro's Advice:**\n- Spend what needed to win decisively\n- Document everything meticulously\n- Substantial \"transition costs\" entirely legitimate\n- Any clearly unnecessary surplus—Rome expects its due\n- How much is \"clearly not needed\"? Debatable\n\n### Crusade End Conditions Clarified\n\n**Juan Corrects:** Bull defines clear endpoint:\n- Convert every mosque to church\n- Expel/convert Muslims (\"deal with\" population)\n- Sing Te Deum in Granada\n- These are specific, measurable conditions\n\n**Juan's Concern:** \"This crusade is going TOO well\"\n- Had hoped to use crusade powers longer\n- Emergency authority, unified command, taxation, Papal backing\n- Wanted time to consolidate rule, reshape governance\n- Sultan's blunder at Alcalá shortened timeline\n\n**Álvaro's Response:**\n- Understands political concern\n- Quick victory ends emergency powers too soon\n- Nobles return to estates, resume fractious behavior\n- But: Granada isn't collapsing easily\n- Guerrilla warfare, foreign reinforcements, organized resistance\n- Campaign will be longer and bloodier than Alcalá suggested\n- \"Careful what you wish for\"—will have time for reforms\n\n---\n\n## PART VIII: TAXATION AND REFORM STRATEGY\n\n### Summoning a Council\n\n**Juan's Proposal:** Summon Cortes or informal council\n- Break great houses' grip on crown\n- Ancient exemptions and outdated revenue estimates\n- Originally planned 6-year crusade for gradual reform\n- That timeline now impossible\n\n**Support Base:**\n- Some great houses support Juan\n- Most smaller nobility supportive\n- Cities supportive\n- Church supportive (hopefully)\n\n**Compensation Offered:**\n- New estates in Granada\n- Monetary compensation\n- Strip ancient rights during crusade\n- While winning but still fighting\n\n### Current Taxation System\n\n**Noble Taxation Reality:**\n- No standard \"normal taxation\" rate\n- System based on ancient feudal obligations\n- Specific rents tied to individual land grants\n- Most assessments from 1311 (119 years old!)\n- Land worth 500,000 maravedís assessed at 50,000\n- Great houses effectively pay 1-2% of actual revenue\n- Should contribute 10-15 million maravedís annually\n- Actually contribute 2-3 million maravedís\n- **Gap: 8-12 million maravedís lost**\n\n**Crusade Tax Impact:**\n- 5% based on actual current revenue\n- More than double current effective rate\n- Assessment program critical for real numbers\n\n### Gradual Implementation Strategy\n\n**Álvaro's Proposal:**\n\n**Phase One (1432):** Update assessments only\n- \"Not imposing new taxes\"\n- \"Simply updating assessments to current values\"\n- \"Collecting what nobles already owe under existing contracts\"\n- \"Just accurate accounting\"\n\n**Phase Two (1433):** Rationalize rates\n- \"Now we have accurate numbers\"\n- \"Let's make it fair—everyone pays 3-4%\"\n- Eliminate patchwork system\n\n**Phase Three (1434+):** Raise to sustainable level\n- \"Kingdom's needs have grown\"\n- \"Raising standard rate to 5-6%\"\n- Each step sounds reasonable in isolation\n- Combined: triple or quadruple tax burden\n\n**Crusade Tax Becomes Baseline:**\n- 5% established as \"reasonable\" during crusade\n- After crusade, don't lower back to old rates\n- Keep as new permanent standard\n- Precedent set that 5% is fair\n\n### New Granada Estates Structure\n\n**Juan's Question:** What tax rate for new estates?\n\n**Álvaro's Recommendation: 3-4% permanent**\n\n**Advantages:**\n1. **Attractive to Crusaders:** Lighter than reformed old nobility (5%+)\n2. **Political Pressure:** New barons paying 3-4% while Duke of Medina Sidonia claims 1%—indefensible\n3. **Modern Standard:** No exemptions, no privileges, clear percentage of actual revenue\n4. **Model for Reform:** Granada nobility becomes template\n5. **Revenue Generation:** 10-15 million maravedís estates at 3-4% = 300,000-600,000 annually\n\n**Political Framing:**\n\"I'm asking old nobility 5% during crusade, but permanent rate for new estates only 3-4%. Once rationalized, you'll pay *less* than crusade tax—just same as everyone else.\"\n\n(Of course, 3-4% of actual revenue still double or triple current payment)\n\n### The \"Just and Fair\" Rate Discussion\n\n**Juan's Question:** Could 10% be \"just and fair\"? Like church lands?\n\n**Álvaro's Initial Enthusiasm:**\n- Biblical tithe precedent\n- Church claims 10% for centuries\n- Papal bull already establishes 10% as legitimate (church properties)\n- Actually moderate compared to peasants (who pay 30-50% total)\n\n**Theological/Equality Arguments:**\n- \"God asks 10% for Church, kingdom asks 10% for defense\"\n- \"Church pays 10%, why should nobles pay less?\"\n- \"Nobles used to give service (blood and time), now they hire others—if won't give service, must give gold\"\n\n**The Risk:** High enough to unite nobility in opposition\n\n**Álvaro's Refined Recommendation:**\n\n**Gradual Approach:**\n- Phase One (1431-1433): 5% crusade tax\n- Phase Two (1434): 7% permanent (\"less than Church\")\n- Phase Three (1435+): 10% (\"true equality before law\")\n\n**Or Bold Approach:**\n- 10% immediately with theological/equality justification\n- Risky but defensible\n- \"Not greedy—asking nobles to pay what Church pays\"\n\n### Noble Military Obligations Consideration\n\n**Juan's Crucial Point:** Nobles obliged to raise levies and campaign\n- Church has only treasure obligation\n- Nobles have treasure AND service\n- Asking same rate ignores additional burden\n\n**Álvaro Agrees—Revised Framework:**\n\n**Base Rate: 7-8%** (Higher than crusade 5%, less than Church 10%)\n\n**Service Credits System:**\n- Every month personal military service: -500 maravedís annual tax\n- Every 100 men provided and maintained: -2,000 maravedís annual tax\n- Maximum reduction: Up to half total tax burden\n\n**Example:** Baron with 50,000 maravedís income\n- Owes 3,500-4,000 maravedís at 7-8%\n- Serves 4 months personally + brings 200 men\n- Reduction: 2,000-6,000 maravedís\n- Military service worth real money\n\n**Advantages:**\n1. **Genuinely Fair:** Rewards actual military service\n2. **Eliminates Corruption:** No more claiming service while charging crown\n3. **Provides Choice:** Fight and save money, or pay full rate\n4. **Incentivizes Service:** Exactly the warrior culture desired\n5. **Strategic Flexibility:** Can increase base rate while increasing credits\n   - Burden falls on nobles who don't serve\n\n**Bottom Line:** 7-8% base, substantial reductions for service = just and fair\n\n---\n\n## PART IX: STRATEGIC TRANSFORMATION - NAVAL vs. LAND POWER\n\n### Juan's Insight\n\nWith Iberian peninsula nearly Christian:\n- No constant need for large land army\n- Internal borders with Portugal, Aragon can be secured\n- Only France north of Pyrenees\n- Can focus on naval operations\n- No threat of huge overland invasions\n\n**Question:** Will this shift affect nobles and realm?\n\n### Álvaro's Realization\n\n\"No one else in Castile is thinking about this yet. But you're absolutely right.\"\n\n**The Fundamental Shift:**\n\n**Current System:** Entire structure of Castilian power based on Reconquista\n- Seven centuries: crown needed great houses\n- Needed castles, armed retinues, ability to field thousands\n- Constant Muslim threat, border warfare, internal conflict\n- Great houses have leverage because they're militarily essential\n\n**After Granada Falls:**\n- Entire peninsula secured except tiny Navarre\n- Portugal allied (Juan's father-in-law)\n- Aragon family (brother-in-law)\n- Pyrenees natural barrier vs France\n- **Where's the existential threat requiring fifty private armies?**\n\n### Land Power vs. Naval Power\n\n**Strategic Shift:**\n- Mediterranean and Atlantic where wealth/power flow\n- Trade with East\n- African coast exploration (Portugal already profiting)\n- Perhaps routes to India\n- Perhaps lands across Ocean Sea\n- **Requires ships, not castles**\n- Professional sailors, not feudal levies\n- Merchants and shipyards, not nobles with retainers\n\n**Naval Power Inherently Centralized:**\n- Can't have forty nobles each building own fleets\n- Shipyards in royal ports\n- Fleets require coordination, supply chains, royal funding\n- Crown controls coasts, harbors, customs houses\n- Naval power flows to whoever controls chokepoints—the king\n\n**Economic Transformation:**\n- Maritime trade generates enormous wealth\n- Wealth crown can tax easily\n- Ships pass through royal ports\n- Merchants need royal licenses\n- Trade goods taxed at customs houses\n- Compare to: taxing duke's estates 300 miles inland\n  - Duke can hide production, claim poor harvests, intimidate assessors\n  - Ship full of spices at Seville? Visible and taxable\n\n**Changed Military Requirements:**\n- Still need army, but different kind\n- Not massive feudal levies called every summer\n- Smaller professional standing force (5,000-8,000)\n- Funded by treasury\n- Enough for order, garrisons, minor threats\n- Noble military contribution becomes... optional, decorative\n\n### Nobles Losing Primary Leverage\n\n**Current Threat:** \"Tax us heavily and we won't provide troops\"\n\n**Future Reality:** Don't desperately need their troops\n- Can fund professionals and navies from trade revenue\n- \"Fine, keep your men home. We'll hire professionals. But you still pay taxes.\"\n\n**New Power Centers:**\n- Port cities critically important\n- Seville, Cádiz, Barcelona, Valencia\n- Atlantic trade ports\n- Merchant class grows wealthy and influential\n- Merchants support strong royal power (protects trade, maintains order, enforces contracts)\n- Natural allies against noble privilege\n\n**Fiscal Independence:**\n- Maritime trade revenue increasingly important\n- Customs, trade monopolies, colonial ventures\n- Less dependent on taxing noble estates\n- More dependent on controlling commerce\n- Commerce thrives under centralized authority, not feudal fragmentation\n\n**Military Obsolescence:**\n- Within generation, noble military establishment becomes... quaint, ceremonial\n- Great houses maintaining armed retainers by tradition, not necessity\n- Like keeping falconers when nobody hunts\n- Showpieces of bygone era\n\n### Perfect Timing for Reform\n\n**Álvaro's Analysis:**\n\n\"You're implementing taxation reform at *last moment* when you still need nobles—during Granada crusade when their service genuinely valuable. Locking in permanent taxation while they feel obligated to cooperate.\n\nBut after Granada? Within 10-15 years, Castile's strategic needs completely shifted. Nobility paying 7-8% revenue, providing increasingly optional service, while real power flows through ports and trade routes they don't control.\n\nThey won't realize what happened until too late. They'll still think like warriors and landowners in world becoming about merchants and sailors.\"\n\n**Portugal as Model:**\n- Ahead on this transformation\n- Pushing down African coast 30 years\n- Naval and commercial empire without huge conquests\n- Nobles weaker, king richer\n- Future on the water\n- Can learn from them, accelerate process\n\n**Strategic Implications:**\n- Portuguese marriage brilliant in this context\n- Gives access to navigation knowledge\n- Alliance with leading maritime power\n- Model for Castile's transformation\n\n---\n\n## PART X: THE PERPETUAL CRUSADE FUND\n\n### The Concept\n\n**Juan's Proposal:**\n- This year (1431): Assess estates' true revenues\n- Combine normal + crusade taxation = 8% revenue\n- Substantial discounts for personal service + providing levies\n- Large houses with many levies could be nearly exempt\n- Eventually make structure permanent\n\n**Álvaro's Concern:**\nLocking in exemptions for providing levies when future won't need those levies\n- 1445: Granada conquered, maritime trade booming\n- Duke of Medina Sidonia exempt because provides 1,000 men\n- But... don't actually need those 1,000 men anymore\n- They're obsolete, but he's still exempt\n\n### Juan's Clarification\n\nOnly levies *actually serving* grant exemption:\n- In peacetime, everyone pays 8% (no levies raised)\n- Only active campaigns trigger service credits\n\n**But nobles will see this:** \"If king doesn't raise levies for 10 years, we all pay 8%\"\n\n### The Revolutionary Framework\n\n**Juan's Solution:** Take inspiration from crusade structure\n\n**The \"Perpetual Crusade Fund\":**\n1. Nobles pay 8% into treasury\n2. Money earmarked for \"eternal crusade\" or \"perpetual expansion\"\n3. Keep money separate from general treasury\n4. Fund future expansion: Africa, other targets\n5. Money buys supplies for armies and levies for future campaigns\n6. Example: Attack Ceuta—call levies, hire ships, use special fund\n7. Roll leftover crusade treasury into this pot\n\n**Key Innovation:** Taxes don't become king's private property\n- Used for kingdom expansion\n- Nobles get same rights to spoils and estates in conquered territories\n- Not enriching royal household—investing in expansion that benefits them\n\n### Álvaro's Enthusiasm\n\n\"Your Majesty... that's *brilliant*.\"\n\n**Political Framing Perfect:**\n- Not paying to enrich king\n- Contributing to permanent war chest for expansion\n- Fund dedicated to conquest that directly benefits nobles\n- \"Not the king's money—the kingdom's military expansion fund\"\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n**1. Political Cover:**\nNobles can't oppose without looking cowardly/traitorous\n- \"You oppose expansion fund? Don't want more Christian lands?\"\n- Frames resistance as unpatriotic\n\n**2. Continued Purpose:**\nWarrior nobility keeps *raison d'être*\n- Not becoming obsolete\n- Spearhead of perpetual expansion\n- Military households, training, culture remain relevant\n- Always another campaign on horizon\n\n**3. Tangible Benefits:**\nEvery conquest generates new estates\n- Baron pays 4,000 maravedís annually\n- Five years later, son wins 50,000 maravedí estate in North Africa\n- Spectacular return on investment\n\n**4. Fiscal Flexibility:**\n\"Military expansion fund\" covers a lot:\n- Building ships (need navy for African campaigns)\n- Training professionals (expansion preparation)\n- Fortifying ports (projecting power across sea)\n- Line between \"expansion fund\" and \"general military budget\" flexible\n\n**5. Self-Reinforcing System:**\n- Fund enables expansion\n- Expansion generates estates and glory\n- Estates and glory motivate supporting fund\n- Cycle strengthens crown while giving nobility purpose and opportunity\n\n**6. Commits to Perpetual Expansion:**\nCreates permanent opportunities for nobles to gain wealth/status\n- Keep supporting strong centralized military state\n- That's what generates profitable campaigns\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n**Naming:** Choose something evoking glory and crusade\n- \"Perpetual Crusade Treasury\"\n- \"Fund for Christian Expansion\"\n- \"Royal Conquest Treasury\"\n\n**Governance:**\n- Supreme Commander (King) has full spending authority for military purposes\n- Advisory council (including trusted nobles) reviews expenditures annually\n- Nobles feel it's \"their\" fund too\n- King retains operational control\n\n**Leftover Crusade Treasury:**\n- Roll ~200,000 florins from current crusade into new fund\n- Proves fund is real, well-resourced, operational immediately\n- Not theoretical future thing—operational now\n\n**Qualifying Expenditures (defined broadly):**\n- Military campaigns\n- Naval development\n- Fortress construction in strategic locations\n- Diplomatic missions to potential conquest targets\n- Intelligence gathering\n- Military training\n- Shipbuilding\n- Garrison maintenance in frontier regions\n- Subsidies to Military Orders for expansion\n- Cast wide net\n\n### Long-Term Strategy\n\n**Potential Problem:** Twenty years from now, what if no realistic targets?\n- Fund keeps accumulating\n- Nobles question why still paying\n\n**Answer: Always targets:**\n- Canary Islands\n- Atlantic exploration like Portugal\n- Supporting Christian forces in Italy if needed\n- Crusades in East if Pope calls\n- Naval expeditions vs Barbary pirates\n- Fortifying Mediterranean vs Ottoman expansion\n- \"Maintaining readiness\" and \"seizing opportunities\"\n\n**If massive surplus accumulates:**\n- \"Military preparedness\" justifies much spending\n- Professional armies aren't free\n- Maintaining powerful fleet expensive\n\n### Political Sophistication\n\n**Álvaro's Assessment:**\n\n\"One of most sophisticated political strategies I've seen, Your Majesty:\n- Increasing permanent royal revenue by 6-8 million maravedís annually\n- Creating mechanism for perpetual expansion\n- Giving nobility continued purpose and profit\n- Framing as serving kingdom, not enriching king personally\n\nNobles won't just accept this—many will *enthusiastically* support it. Especially younger nobles seeking opportunities. Great houses might grumble about 8%, but when sons winning African estates with that money, they'll quiet down.\"\n\n### Timeline for Announcement\n\n**This Year (1431):**\n- Informal council after campaign season\n- \"Council of Victory\"\n- Present as proposal: \"Here's concept for your thoughts\"\n- Get reactions, hear concerns, let them feel consulted\n- Plant the seed\n\n**Next Year (1432):**\n- Formal Cortes\n- By then: Know which nobles support, which need convincing\n- Refined proposal based on feedback\n- Granada completed or nearly so (proves model works)\n- \"Look what we accomplished with coordinated funding. Now make it permanent.\"\n\n**Advantages of Delay:**\n- Nobles feel consulted, not dictated to\n- Time to demonstrate fiscal responsibility\n- Show crusade treasury managed well\n- Prove system works\n\n---\n\n## PART XI: LETTER TO POPE MARTIN V\n\n### Context\n\nPope Martin V elderly (~70), ill\n- This might be one of his last great triumphs\n- Letter announcing victory will delight him\n- Validates everything he invested in crusade\n\n### Official Military Report\n\n**Content:**\n- Battle of Alcalá: Sultan's army destroyed, 10,000+ casualties\n- Alcalá la Real fortress surrendered\n- Vélez-Málaga taken on coast\n- Multiple fortresses under siege\n- Granada's military power broken\n\n**The Conversions:**\nWhat will truly move Rome:\n- 70 Muslim warriors renouncing Islam after witnessing battle\n- Choosing baptism freely, not forced\n- Qadi led morning prayers for Sultan's victory, then converted\n- Theological implications—God's favor so evident even enemy recognized it\n- Proof of divine backing\n\n**The Sacred Banner:**\n- Carried into battle\n- Inspired troops\n- True Cross relic led crusade to victory\n- Rome's sacred gifts used and honored\n\n**The Challenge:**\n- Honest that Granada resisting with guerrilla warfare\n- Foreign Muslim support arriving\n- Campaign will take time\n- But confident with God's help\n\n### Personal Letter from Juan\n\n> Dear Father,\n>\n> I have won a great victory in the field against the Moors and God willing will do so again. The crusade goes well and my thoughts go to what we talked about when you granted me the papal bull. Support for Christians everywhere in Europe. Against heresy and against the rising power of the Ottomans in the east. And across the strait of Gibraltar lies Africa still completely in the grip of Islam, raiding and enslaving our coast. The work is far from done, even after we secure the entire Iberian peninsula.\n>\n> When I knelt down before you and pledged myself to the Grace of God, I meant it. If - God willing - I can complete the reconquista, I will continue to carry your banner overseas to whatever cause or land God guides me to. I will continue your crusade on, convert or establish churches, spread the gospel, bring populations under Christian rule and sing the lord's praises for as long as I draw breath.\n>\n> Father, I selfishly ask you to bless my wife, Isabel of Portugal who is a devout queen and is every bit the virtuous christian woman any man could wish. She regards it her charge to pray for the nation as queen and this responsibility weighs heavily on her. I pray that this burden is lifted a bit or she can bear it with more grace. She is young still. Pray for us father. As I pray for you as well.\n>\n> Your servant,\n> Juan of Castille.\n\n### Álvaro's Analysis\n\n**What the Letter Accomplishes:**\n\n**1. Reports Success:** Expected, necessary\n\n**2. Positions Juan as Perpetual Crusader:**\n- Not king completing one crusade and retiring\n- Champion of Christendom carrying banner wherever needed\n- \"I am your instrument. Point me where needed, and I will go.\"\n- Commitment popes dream of but rarely receive\n\n**3. Establishes Broader Mission:**\n- Reminds Pope of Rome conversation\n- Beyond Granada: Africa, Ottomans, heresy, supporting Christians everywhere\n- Shows commitment to Church's global mission\n\n**4. Humanizes Juan:**\n- Not just warrior-king\n- Devoted husband concerned for wife's spiritual wellbeing\n- Shows genuine care and humility\n- Will move Pope personally\n\n**5. Creates Long-Term Leverage:**\nWhen Martin V dies (could be soon), next Pope inherits correspondence showing Juan pledged to perpetual crusading. Leverage for decades.\n\n### Format and Delivery\n\n**Two Documents:**\n\n**Official Letter:**\n- Military report\n- Conversions\n- Banner effectiveness\n- Suitable for Vatican archives\n- Potentially wider circulation\n\n**Personal Letter:**\n- Sealed separately\n- Marked private for Pope's eyes only\n- Personal nature makes more powerful\n- Concerns for Isabel more effective as intimate correspondence\n\n**Envoy: Fray Hernando**\n- More than couriers—deserves proper envoy\n- Witnessed battle, conversions, everything\n- Can testify personally about what he saw\n- Can carry personal letter with appropriate gravity\n\n**Plus: Ahmad al-Zarqali**\n- The converted qadi from Alcalá\n- Living proof of conversions\n- Can testify before Pope and cardinals\n- His own journey from Islam to Christianity\n\n### The Journey Together\n\n**Fray Hernando and Ahmad:**\n- Weeks traveling together Castile to Rome\n- Fray Hernando teaching deeper Christian theology\n- Ahmad sharing Islamic scholarship\n- Perspective on Reconquista from other side\n- Arrive as genuine companions after profound theological discussions\n\n**What Rome Will See:**\n- Spiritual advisor + Muslim scholar who joined cause\n- Qadi who led morning prayers for Sultan, then chose baptism\n- After witnessing battle and theological crisis\n- Not forced, not coerced—genuine faith crisis resolved by conversion\n\n**Ahmad's Testimony:**\nCan speak personally before Pope and cardinals:\n- What he saw at Alcalá\n- Theological implications for Granada's faithful\n- His own journey from doubt to faith\n- Living proof crusade achieving spiritual victories, not just military\n\n### Impact in Rome\n\n**The Story:**\nWhen word spreads that Muslim qadi converted and traveled to pay respects to Pope:\n- Becomes a story\n- Artists will paint it\n- Chroniclers will write about it\n- Validates entire crusade beyond military reports\n\n**Interest in Ahmad:**\nCardinals will want to:\n- Meet him\n- Hear his story\n- Debate theology with him\n- Rome will be fascinated\n\n**Safety Concerns:**\n- Ahmad under royal protection\n- Letters bearing Juan's seal and Capranica's\n- Identifying him as valued court member\n- Traveling on official business\n- With Fray Hernando as companion and protector\n- Capranica's associates watching over them\n- Rome will likely be fascinated rather than hostile\n\n**The Journey's Effect on Ahmad:**\nSeeing Rome—churches, art, devotion—could cement conversion\n- Deepen faith in ways military camp never would\n- Experiencing heart of Christendom\n\n### Timeline\n\n**Departure:** Within the week\n- Pope ill, could die before receiving news\n- This could be one of last great triumphs of his papacy\n- Let him savor it\n\n**Journey Time:** Several weeks to Rome\n\n---\n\n## KEY THEMES AND STRATEGIC INSIGHTS\n\n### Military Transformation\n\n**From Alcalá to Jaén:**\n- Crushing victory creates opportunities\n- But Granada not collapsing\n- Guerrilla warfare proving effective\n- Foreign support strengthening defense\n- Quick victory unlikely—campaign will be costly, prolonged\n\n**Three-Front Coordination:**\n- Eastern army (Master of Calatrava, 15,000) besieging Íllora\n- Western army (Estúñiga, 12,000) holding Vélez-Málaga\n- Reserve force (Enrique, 5,000) at Alcalá\n- Juan in Jaén coordinating all three\n\n### Granada's Resilience\n\n**Despite Catastrophe:**\n- Court paralyzed but surviving\n- Diplomatic efforts failed\n- But military resistance organized\n- Guerrilla campaign moderately successful\n- Foreign support arriving (Moroccan troops, financial aid)\n- Mercenaries hired (3,000-4,000)\n- By mid-July: 14,000 troops (still outnumbered 2.4:1)\n- Real army again—can't win but can make victory very costly\n\n### Strategic Vision\n\n**Juan's Long-Term Thinking:**\n- Not just winning Granada\n- Transforming Castilian governance\n- Using crusade emergency for permanent reforms\n- Understanding strategic shift from land to naval power\n- Positioning for perpetual expansion beyond Iberia\n\n**Taxation Revolution:**\n- From 1-2% (current noble payment) to 7-8% permanent\n- Service credits reward actual military contribution\n- New Granada estates at 3-4% (model for future)\n- Perpetual Crusade Fund framing makes it acceptable\n- Could generate 6-8 million maravedís additional annual revenue\n\n**Perpetual Expansion Framework:**\n- Fund dedicated to future conquests\n- Nobles invest in own opportunities\n- Self-reinforcing cycle\n- Keeps warrior culture relevant\n- Justifies continued military spending\n- Positions Castile for maritime age\n\n### Personal Elements\n\n**Isabel's Pregnancy:**\n- Early signs, not yet confirmed\n- Would secure succession\n- Must return to Toledo when certain\n- Strategic implications enormous\n\n**Martín de Oviedo's Death:**\n- Guardian who saved Juan's life\n- Dies from wounds despite care\n- Juan promises to care for daughters\n- Personal cost of warfare made real\n\n### Diplomatic Positioning\n\n**Letter to Pope:**\n- Reports military success\n- Positions Juan as perpetual crusader\n- Pledges service beyond Granada\n- Requests blessing for Isabel\n- Sends converted qadi with Fray Hernando\n- Creates leverage for decades\n- Shows commitment Rome craves\n\n---\n\n## DECISIONS MADE\n\n### Military:\n- Master of Calatrava: 15,000 to besiege Íllora\n- Infante Enrique: 5,000 reserve at Alcalá\n- Estúñiga: Consolidate at Vélez-Málaga (implied)\n- Juan coordinates from Jaén\n\n### Political:\n- Informal council this year (late 1431) to introduce Perpetual Crusade Fund concept\n- Formal Cortes next year (1432) to make it official\n- 8% permanent tax rate with service credits\n- New Granada estates at 3-4%\n\n### Diplomatic:\n- Send Fray Hernando and Ahmad al-Zarqali to Rome\n- Official military report + personal letter to Pope\n- Position Juan as perpetual crusader\n- Demonstrate conversion successes\n\n---\n\n## LOOKING FORWARD TO CHAPTER 18\n\n### Immediate Situation (Mid-April 1431)\n\n**Military:**\n- Íllora under siege by Master of Calatrava\n- Guerrilla raids disrupting
