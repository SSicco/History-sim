      "say": "Thought process: Strategized royal pilgrimage route, assessed high probability of success.\n\nThe player is asking about traveling through Castile to Santiago de Compostela. Let me assess the probability of success for this journey.\n\n**Context from the documents:**\n- Date: May 15, 1430\n- Juan has just rejoined his pilgrimage party after confronting the Infantes\n- The party includes Captain Fernán, 10 royal guards (in good equipment), Fray Hernando, 4 servants, 1 secretary (~30 people total)\n- They're traveling north from near Valladolid to Santiago\n- Infante Juan has been removed from council and is openly hostile\n- A diplomatic letter has been sent to Alfonso V of Aragon\n\n**Distance and Route:**\nSantiago de Compostela is in Galicia, northwest Castile. From Valladolid area, this is roughly 300-350 miles. In medieval times, this would take approximately 2-3 weeks of travel.\n\n**Factors Supporting Success:**\n1. **Within his own kingdom** - This is Castilian territory\n2. **Royal party** - 10 well-equipped guards, clearly marked as king's entourage\n3. **Pilgrimage route** - Santiago is major pilgrimage destination, well-traveled path\n4. **Spring season** - Good weather for travel (May)\n5. **Recent royal authority demonstration** - Just showed strength against Infantes\n6. **Popular pilgrimage** - Religious cover is believable and respected\n7. **Professional leadership** - Captain Fernán is competent\n8. **Early in crisis** - Infante Juan was just removed; he hasn't had time to organize opposition\n\n**Factors Creating Risk:**\n1. **Infante Juan's hostility** - He was just publicly humiliated and removed\n2. **Infantes have estates and allies in Castile** - Could potentially intercept\n3. **Travel always has risks** - Bandits, accidents, illness, weather\n4. **Political tensions** - Some nobles might see opportunity\n\n\n5. **King traveling away from capital** - Potential perception of vulnerability\n\nI see the political landscape is complex. The king's absence could be interpreted as weakness, but the timing works in his favor. Infante Juan is still reeling from his recent defeat and lacks immediate capacity to mount a serious challenge. The religious nature of the journey provides additional protection, making any potential interference politically dangerous. Travel risks exist, but the well-equipped royal party and established pilgrimage route offer significant safeguards.\n\nThe journey appears strategically sound, with minimal political threat at this early stage. Routine travel challenges are the primary concern, not organized opposition. The route's religious significance and the king's preparedness suggest a high probability of successful passage.\n\n\nChapter 3: The Road to Santiago\n\n\nThe Journey North\n\n\nDate: May 15, 1430\nLocation: Northern Castile, departed from near Valladolid\nDestination: Santiago de Compostela, Galicia\nDistance: Approximately 300-350 miles\nExpected Duration: 2-3 weeks\n\n\n\nAction Probability Assessment\n\n\nYour Proposed Action: Travel with your pilgrimage party through Castile to Santiago de Compostela\n\n\nMy Assessment: HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS\n\n\nFactors Supporting Success:\n\n\nRoyal Authority in Own Territory: You are traveling through your own kingdom with clear royal identification. Local authorities, towns, and nobles along the route have every reason to facilitate a royal pilgrimage.\n\nWell-Established Pilgrimage Route: The Camino de Santiago is one of Christendom's most important pilgrimage routes. The infrastructure exists - monasteries, hospices, bridges, and roads maintained specifically for pilgrims.\n\nAdequate Security: Captain Fernán commands 10 experienced royal guards in new equipment. This is sufficient to deter common bandits and command respect at every stop.\n\nFavorable Season: Early May offers good traveling weather - not too hot, roads dry from winter, plenty of daylight.\n\nReligious Protection: Attacking pilgrims, especially royal pilgrims, would be scandalous. The religious nature of your journey provides significant social protection.\n\nTiming: This is immediately after the confrontation. Infante Juan, though hostile, has had no time to organize opposition. He's still reeling from public humiliation and removal from the council.\n\nRecent Display of Strength: Your dramatic return and successful confrontation demonstrated that you're not easily manipulated. Potential troublemakers would think twice.\n\n\nPotential Risks (but manageable):\n\n\nNormal Travel Hazards: Weather changes, illness, accidents, minor banditry - the usual dangers of medieval travel.\n\nLocal Tensions: Some areas might have noble feuds or local conflicts, but these are routine challenges that experienced travelers can navigate.\n\nInfantes' Allies: While the Infantes have estates and supporters in Castile, organizing interception would require time and coordination they don't yet have.\n\nDistance from Capital: Some might view your absence as opportunity, but this is inherent to the pilgrimage plan you've already committed to.\n\n\nHistorical Context:\n\n\nRoyal pilgrimages were common and generally respected. The Santiago route was well-policed by local authorities who benefited from pilgrim traffic. Major incidents on such journeys were rare and noteworthy precisely because they violated strong social and religious norms.\n\n\n\nPlease roll your dice and tell me the result category:\n\n\nGreat Success\n\nSuccess\n\nFailure\n\nCatastrophic Failure\n\n\nBased on your roll, I will describe how the journey unfolds."

      "say": "Thought process: Strategized pilgrimage journey's potential success and positive outcomes.\n\nGreat success on a high probability action means not only do they arrive safely, but there are additional positive benefits. Let me think about what would make sense:\n\n1. The journey itself goes smoothly - no issues\n2. Additional benefits could include:\n   - Positive encounters that strengthen Juan's position\n   - Gathering useful intelligence along the way\n   - Building rapport with the pilgrimage party\n   - Positive reception from towns and common people\n   - Maybe discovering something useful about the realm\n   - Strengthening relationships with companions\n   - Perhaps a noble or important figure joins them\n   - Good intelligence from the cabinet members working in his absence\n\nGiven this is a pilgrimage and Juan has been learning about his realm, I think the \"great success\" should involve:\n- Safe, swift arrival\n- Positive public reception that demonstrates growing popular support\n- Useful intelligence or connections made along the way\n- Deepening bonds with key companions (Fray Hernando, Captain Fernán)\n- Perhaps learning something important about the common people's view\n- Maybe a useful encounter with someone who becomes an ally\n\nLet me write this as an immersive journey with multiple benefits that set Juan up well for the Rome portion of his journey.\n\n\nChapter 3: The Road to Santiago (Continued)\n\n\nThe Journey North - Great Success\n\n\nMay 15 - June 2, 1430\n\n\n\nWeek One: Through the Heartland\n\n\nYour pilgrimage party moves steadily northwest from Valladolid, following the ancient pilgrim routes through the Castilian heartland. What begins as a necessary journey transforms into something more - a revelation about the kingdom you rule.\n\n\nDay 3: Palencia\n\n\nThe first major town receives you with unexpected warmth. When word spreads that the King himself travels as a humble pilgrim, crowds gather. Not the calculated gatherings of nobles, but genuine people - merchants, craftsmen, farmers from surrounding villages.\n\n\nAn elderly woman pushes through, falling to her knees: \"Bless us, Your Majesty! Bless us as you go to pray for our souls at Santiago!\"\n\n\nYou're uncertain how to respond. Fray Hernando whispers: \"Touch her head, say you will pray for her at the shrine.\"\n\n\nYou do so, and the crowd erupts in appreciation. More people press forward - not demanding, but hopeful. They see you as their king, yes, but also as their intercessor with God. The dual nature of kingship has never felt more tangible.\n\n\nThat evening, the Bishop of Palencia hosts you. Over dinner, he confides: \"Your Majesty, the common people suffer much from noble feuds. Lords raid each other's lands, and it is the farmers who lose their crops, their sons, their livestock. They hope you will bring order.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán adds quietly: \"The guards noticed it too, Majesty. People asking when you'll rein in the nobles. They don't understand the politics - they just know things were better under your father.\"\n\n\nInsight gained: The common people are your potential base of support, but they need protection from noble chaos.\n\n\nDays 4-6: Across the Douro\n\n\nThe route takes you through fertile valleys where spring planting is underway. At each village, your party stops briefly. You insist on speaking with local priests and aldermen, asking about conditions.\n\n\nA pattern emerges:\n\n\nTaxes are irregular and often excessive when nobles collect them\n\nJustice is scarce - disputes fester for years waiting for traveling judges\n\nTrade is hampered by local tolls and \"customs\" that various lords impose\n\nBut people are industrious, faithful, and surprisingly hopeful\n\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval, traveling with you, remarks: \"Your Majesty, you're building something here. Every person who sees you, speaks with you - they'll remember. They'll tell their neighbors. 'The young king stopped in our village.' It matters.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando observes you carefully during these encounters. One evening, he asks: \"You genuinely care for these people, don't you?\"\n\n\n\"They're my people, Father. Not the nobles' subjects to be squeezed. Mine to protect.\" You pause. \"Is that pride speaking, or duty?\"\n\n\n\"Both, I think. But duty informed by genuine care is no sin.\"\n\n\nDays 7-9: The Mountains of León\n\n\nThe terrain becomes more challenging as you cross into the Kingdom of León. Here, the pilgrimage route enters mountainous country, and you encounter other pilgrims - dozens of groups heading to Santiago from across Christendom.\n\n\nA French merchant recognizes your royal party despite your modest presentation: \"Mon Dieu! It is the King of Castile himself! Walking like a common pilgrim!\"\n\n\nWord spreads among the pilgrim groups. That night at a monastery hospice, foreign pilgrims seek you out:\n\n\nGermans who praise your piety\n\nItalians who ask about trade routes\n\nPortuguese who speak of King João's respect for fellow monarchs who honor God\n\nAn English knight who fought in France, now seeking redemption\n\n\nThe English knight, Sir Thomas Beaumont, requests private audience. He's weathered, perhaps forty, with a soldier's bearing.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I've heard whispers even on the pilgrimage road. Men speak of troubles in Castile - ambitious princes, plots, divisions. If you seek loyal swords unburdened by local politics...\" He lets it hang.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán later advises: \"Foreign knights can be valuable, Majesty. No local allegiances, no family ties to constrain them. Though they're expensive.\"\n\n\nOpportunity identified: Foreign mercenaries and knights might provide politically neutral military force.\n\n\nDay 10: León Cathedral\n\n\nThe great cathedral city of León welcomes you with full ceremony. The Bishop, a stout man of sixty, is politically astute:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I rejoice at your pilgrimage. But I confess concern - the Infantes have sent letters suggesting the realm is unsettled. They paint your journey as... impulsive.\"\n\n\nYou expected this. \"My lord Bishop, I removed Infante Juan from the regency council for plotting to make it permanent while I still stood in the palace. His brother remains on the council. Does that sound impulsive, or decisive?\"\n\n\nThe Bishop's eyes widen. \"Ah. That explains much. They described it differently in their letters.\"\n\n\n\"I'm certain they did.\"\n\n\nHe smiles slowly. \"Then let me write my own letters, Majesty. The truth should circulate as widely as their version.\"\n\n\nAlliance gained: The Bishop of León will counter the Infantes' narrative among church hierarchy.\n\n\nWeek Two: Into Galicia\n\n\nDays 11-14: The Galician Highlands\n\n\nThe final approach to Santiago takes you through wild, beautiful country. Rain comes frequently - the famous Galician weather - but your party's spirits remain high.\n\n\nYou notice something: your guards have formed genuine camaraderie with you. Not just duty, but loyalty born of shared hardship. They've seen you ride through rain, sleep in common hospices, speak humbly with peasants. You're not just a distant king anymore.\n\n\nSergeant García, riding beside you through a downpour: \"Majesty, remember you asked us about real combat? About what makes men fight?\"\n\n\n\"I remember.\"\n\n\n\"This, sire. This is part of it. Shared misery, shared purpose. We'll follow you because we've walked this road with you.\"\n\n\nOne evening, you work with Captain Fernán on combat skills. He's impressed: \"You've continued practicing, Majesty. You move better than a month ago. Not expert yet, but competent. That's something.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando has been quieter this week, observing. Finally, he speaks: \"Your Majesty, I've watched you with the common people. You listen to them. Truly listen, not just perform listening. That's rare in kings.\"\n\n\n\"Should I not listen to my subjects?\"\n\n\n\"You should. Many don't. They think kingship means telling others what to do. You're learning it also means understanding what needs doing.\"\n\n\nDays 15-17: Approaching Santiago\n\n\nThe density of pilgrims increases dramatically as you near the holy city. Thousands are converging for the spring pilgrimage season. Your party merges into the great flow of humanity.\n\n\nAt the final monastery before Santiago, you meet someone unexpected:\n\n\nDon Fernando de Guzmán, a bishop from Seville, about 50 years old. He recognizes you immediately despite your modest appearance.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty! I did not expect to encounter you here!\" He's traveling with his own small party, returning from Santiago.\n\n\nOver dinner, he speaks frankly: \"Sire, I bring news from Seville. The city prepares for your Royal Council in November. But there are concerns - the Infantes have allies there, particularly in the nobility. They're already positioning for that gathering.\"\n\n\n\"What do you counsel, my lord Bishop?\"\n\n\n\"Arrive early. Meet with city leaders privately before the formal council. Build support among the merchant guilds - they fear noble chaos more than anything. And...\" he hesitates.\n\n\n\"Speak freely.\"\n\n\n\"Consider bringing something dramatic to the council. A treaty, a victory, a reform - something that demonstrates you're not just another noble in a crown, but a king with vision.\"\n\n\nStrategic intelligence gained: Advance warning about Seville politics and tactical advice for the November council.\n\n\nDay 18: Santiago de Compostela\n\n\nJune 2, 1430\n\n\nYou crest the final hill and see it: the spires of the great cathedral rising above the ancient city. Bells ring across Santiago as thousands of pilgrims pour into the city.\n\n\nYour party enters through the Francigena Gate with the great pilgrim crowd. For a moment, you're just another soul seeking Santiago's blessing - anonymous in the mass of humanity.\n\n\nThen someone shouts: \"¡El Rey! ¡Es el Rey!\" (The King! It's the King!)\n\n\nThe crowd parts. People fall to their knees. The cathedral bells intensify their ringing.\n\n\nThe Archbishop of Santiago, Don Lope de Mendoza (a distant relative of your advisor Íñigo), emerges in full regalia with cathedral canons and clergy.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty! All of Christendom honors you! A king who walks humbly as a pilgrim to our blessed shrine!\"\n\n\nThe next hours are a blur of ceremony:\n\n\nEntry procession through cheering crowds\n\nHigh Mass at the cathedral\n\nYour prayers at the tomb of Saint James\n\nTe Deum sung by the cathedral choir\n\nPublic blessing before thousands\n\n\nBut the most meaningful moment comes later, in quiet prayer before the silver reliquary containing the apostle's remains.\n\n\nKneeling alone (Fray Hernando nearby but silent), you pray genuinely:\n\n\n\"Saint James, you walked with Christ and carried His word to this far shore. I am young, uncertain, and walk a path full of dangers. Grant me wisdom to know God's will from my own ambition. Grant me courage to do what must be done. And if I fail - if I lead my kingdom to ruin through pride or foolishness - may God grant Castile a better king than I.\"\n\n\nThe silver and gold of the shrine gleam in candlelight. You feel... not a voice or vision, but a profound settling. Not certainty, but acceptance of uncertainty. Not answers, but peace with the questions.\n\n\nFray Hernando helps you to your feet. \"What did you feel, Majesty?\"\n\n\n\"That whatever happens, I must try. And that God knows I am trying.\"\n\n\nHe nods. \"That may be the truest prayer a king can offer.\"\n\n\nThe Benefits of Great Success\n\n\nYour journey to Santiago has yielded significant advantages:\n\n\n1. Popular Support Strengthened\nThroughout Castile and León, thousands have seen their king traveling humbly as a pilgrim, stopping in villages, listening to common concerns. Stories spread faster than you traveled - \"The young king cares for us.\"\n\n\n2. Church Alliances Formed\n\n\nBishop of Palencia sympathetic to your cause\n\nBishop of León actively countering Infantes' narrative\n\nBishop Fernando de Guzmán of Seville providing strategic intelligence\n\nArchbishop of Santiago has blessed your pilgrimage publicly\n\n\n3. Intelligence Gathered\nYou now understand:\n\n\nThe common people's main grievances (noble chaos, irregular justice, excessive tolls)\n\nThe Infantes are circulating their version of events\n\nSeville politics require early attention before November council\n\nForeign knights are available if you need politically neutral military force\n\n\n4. Personal Bonds Strengthened\n\n\nYour royal guards have developed genuine loyalty through shared hardship\n\nCaptain Fernán sees you as a competent student and worthy commander\n\nFray Hernando has observed your genuine care for subjects\n\nYour pilgrimage party is now a cohesive unit\n\n\n5. Strategic Position in Santiago\nYou're now in position to:\n\n\nRest for a few days while finalizing Rome plans\n\nMaintain your \"pilgrimage\" cover story\n\nDepart from Galicia (far from Valladolid's politics) for the secret journey to Rome\n\nHave fulfilled your stated pilgrimage goal, giving legitimacy to whatever you do next\n\n\n6. Unexpected Opportunity\nSir Thomas Beaumont, the English knight, has indirectly offered his services - foreign military expertise without local political complications.\n\n\n\nEvening in Santiago - June 2, 1430\n\n\nThe Archbishop has housed you in the cathedral's finest guest quarters. Your party gathers for dinner - a private meal after the day's public ceremonies.\n\n\nThe mood is celebratory but also expectant. Everyone knows Santiago was only the first destination. The real journey lies ahead.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán raises a cup: \"To His Majesty - who kept pace with his guards through three hundred miles of Castile!\"\n\n\nThe guards cheer. Even Fray Hernando smiles.\n\n\nYou stand, cup in hand. \"My friends, we have walked far together. But I must be honest with you now about where we walk next.\"\n\n\nThe room quiets. They know something significant is coming.\n\n\nHow do you wish to proceed, Your Majesty?\n\n\nDo you:\n\n\nReveal the full Rome plan to the entire party now?\n\nSpeak privately with key individuals first (Captain Fernán, Fray Hernando) before broader announcement?\n\nMaintain the pilgrimage fiction a bit longer while you finalize Rome logistics?\n\nSomething else entirely?\n\n\nWhat are your orders?"

This is a private conversation between the three of them.\n\nI should:\n1. Have them react realistically to this revelation\n2. Address the practical logistics of getting a ship from Santiago/Galicia to Rome\n3. Discuss timeline and feasibility\n4. Have them offer counsel on the approach\n\nCaptain Fernán is a practical military man - he'll think about security, logistics, costs, and practicality.\n\nFray Hernando already knows about Rome from confession, but this is the first he's hearing that they're leaving immediately and that the Captain is being brought in.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Santiago/Galicia has ports (A Coruña, etc.)\n- Sea route from Galicia to Rome would go around Iberian peninsula, through Strait of Gibraltar, across Mediterranean\n- This is a LONG sea journey - 2000+ miles\n- Alternative would be overland through France to Italian ports, then shorter sea journey\n- Or land route all the way (even longer)\n- Timeline: It's early June. Council is November 8. That's about 5 months.\n- Sea journey could take 3-4 weeks one way in good conditions, longer with bad weather/stops\n- Need time in Rome for diplomacy\n- Need return journey time\n- Should work timeline-wise but will be tight\n\nLet me have them discuss these practical matters realistically.\n\n\nPrivate Counsel - Evening, June 2, 1430\n\n\nYou guide Captain Fernán and Fray Hernando to a small private chamber off the main guest quarters. The noise of the celebration fades as you close the heavy door.\n\n\nThe Captain reads your expression immediately. \"This is about what comes next, Majesty.\"\n\n\n\"Yes. Sit, both of you.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando settles on a simple bench, his face carefully neutral. He already knows, of course, from confession - but he cannot reveal that.\n\n\nYou stand before them both. \"Our next destination is Rome. Captain, I need you to secure us passage by ship - there and back. My intention is to meet Pope Martin V personally, introduce myself, and seek his blessing. Ideally, obtain a crusade bull for Granada. We must return to Seville in time for the Royal Council on November eighth.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán's Reaction\n\n\nThe Captain's eyebrows rise, but he doesn't look shocked - more like pieces are clicking into place.\n\n\n\"Rome.\" He's quiet for a moment, thinking through logistics. \"That explains why you chose Galicia for the pilgrimage. We're positioned on the Atlantic coast, away from the Infantes' strongest territories.\"\n\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\nHe stands, begins pacing - his habit when working through military problems. \"Let me think through this, Majesty. Sea route from Galician ports... we'd sail south along the Portuguese coast, through the Strait of Gibraltar, then east across the Mediterranean to Rome. Perhaps two thousand miles by sea, maybe more depending on the route.\"\n\n\n\"Can it be done?\"\n\n\n\"In terms of distance and time? Yes. It's June now, council is November eighth. That's five months. Figure three to four weeks for the voyage if we have favorable winds and weather - could be six weeks or more if we don't. Same for the return. Time in Rome for your diplomacy... it's tight, but possible.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, rubbing his jaw. \"The complications are different though, Majesty.\"\n\n\n\"Explain.\"\n\n\nThe Captain's Concerns\n\n\n\"First, cost. Chartering a ship for this journey won't be cheap - we're talking several thousand maravedís, possibly ten thousand or more for a vessel capable of this voyage with proper security. Do we have funds?\"\n\n\nYou nod. \"I brought sufficient treasury access. Cost is not the primary concern.\"\n\n\n\"Second, security. The Mediterranean has pirates - Barbary corsairs especially, but also others. We'd need a well-armed merchant vessel or arrange for naval escort. The Genoese and Venetians run these routes regularly; they know the dangers.\"\n\n\n\"Your recommendation?\"\n\n\n\"Find a Genoese merchant ship making the run to Italian ports. They're well-armed, experienced, and their presence alone deters most pirates. Costs more, but much safer than hiring some Portuguese captain with a fishing boat.\"\n\n\nHe continues, warming to the problem: \"Third, secrecy versus practicality. You wanted this quiet, but chartering a major ship requires contracts, port authorities, cargo arrangements. People will know a significant party is sailing. We can obscure the exact identity - say we're a noble household on pilgrimage to Rome - but complete secrecy is impossible.\"\n\n\n\"That's acceptable. As long as word doesn't reach the Infantes before we're at sea.\"\n\n\n\"Which brings me to fourth: the overland alternative.\"\n\n\nThe Overland Option\n\n\nCaptain Fernán stops pacing, faces you directly. \"Majesty, we could travel overland through France to the Italian ports - Marseille or Genoa - then take a much shorter sea voyage to Rome. Cuts the water travel significantly.\"\n\n\n\"But adds weeks on horseback.\"\n\n\n\"Yes, but consider the advantages: more control over our route, easier to maintain low profile, can stop at important cities and monasteries - build relationships with French church hierarchy. And frankly, I trust roads more than I trust the Mediterranean in summer.\"\n\n\nHe sees your skepticism. \"I'm a soldier, Majesty. I've crossed the Strait of Gibraltar once. Spent three days vomiting over the rail while Moorish pirates eyed our transport. I know my business on land; the sea is... less certain.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando Speaks\n\n\nThe monk has been listening quietly. Now he leans forward:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, may I offer a spiritual perspective?\"\n\n\n\"Please.\"\n\n\n\"The sea route is faster but more dangerous - trusting to winds, weather, and providence. The land route is slower but more deliberate - following the ancient paths of pilgrims and missionaries. Both have merit.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"But I confess, the Captain's point about French church connections interests me. The Pope will ask who supports you, who vouches for you. Arriving with letters from French bishops and abbots, having stopped at Cluny or other great monasteries...\" He lets it hang.\n\n\n\"You think the Pope needs convincing that I'm legitimate?\"\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, you are eighteen years old, unknown in Rome, arriving from a kingdom the papal curia considers distant and unstable. Yes, I think building your credibility along the way would be wise. The Pope receives many petitions. Why should he grant yours?\"\n\n\nIt's a sobering point.\n\n\nThe Captain's Practical Questions\n\n\nFernán sits back down. \"Majesty, regardless of route, I need to know: who comes with us?\"\n\n\n\"What do you suggest?\"\n\n\n\"Minimum party for credibility and security: You, me, Fray Hernando as chaplain, four to six of our best guards - men who kept your secret on the return to Valladolid, who've proven themselves. One secretary to handle correspondence. Perhaps ten to twelve people total.\"\n\n\n\"Not the entire pilgrimage party?\"\n\n\n\"The others can return to Castile with a cover story - you've gone deeper into contemplative retreat at a remote Galician monastery. Buys us time before people realize you've left the kingdom entirely. And frankly, Majesty, the fewer people who know the full truth, the better.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"But there's another question: What do we do about that English knight, Sir Thomas Beaumont?\"\n\n\nYou'd almost forgotten about him. \"Why does he matter?\"\n\n\n\"Because he's a skilled foreign knight who approached you, Majesty. No Castilian ties, combat experience in France, seeking employment. If you want a few extra swords with no local politics attached, he and any companions he might have could be valuable. And hiring foreign knights for a pilgrimage to Rome? Perfectly normal. Adds to our cover.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando's Concern\n\n\nThe monk interjects: \"Captain, forgive me, but hiring warriors for a pilgrimage seems... contradictory.\"\n\n\n\"With respect, Father, pilgrims get attacked. Wealthy pilgrims especially. Armed escort is common sense, not contradiction.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando nods reluctantly. \"I suppose that's true.\"\n\n\nHe turns to you. \"Your Majesty, I have one other concern. The Pope is... politically sophisticated. Pope Martin V is no unworldly holy man. He's navigated schism, Council politics, and Italian power struggles. When you meet him, you cannot simply appear as a young king seeking a crusade bull.\"\n\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n\"You must offer him something. Not just ask for blessing, but present how granting your request serves the Church's interests. Why should Rome care about Granada when they have concerns closer to home - the Hussites in Bohemia, reconciling with Constantinople, managing Italian politics?\"\n\n\nThe monk is more politically astute than you expected.\n\n\n\"What would you suggest?\"\n\n\n\"That we discuss strategy before we arrive. But broadly: emphasize how Granada's conversion serves broader Christian unity, how successful crusade strengthens papal authority by demonstrating the Pope can still summon Christendom to holy war, how your success makes you a strong and grateful ally in Iberia.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán grunts approval. \"The Father makes sense. Never ask for favor without explaining what's in it for them.\"\n\n\nThe Decision Point\n\n\nBoth men look at you expectantly.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"So, Majesty, I need clear orders:\n\n\nRoute: Sea all the way, or overland through France then short sea voyage?\n\n\nParty Size: Just core group of 10-12, or larger?\n\n\nThe English Knight: Hire Sir Thomas Beaumont and any companions, or not?\n\n\nTiming: Depart as soon as ship/arrangements are made, or take a few days to rest and plan?\n\n\nCover Story: What do we tell the rest of the pilgrimage party who aren't coming?\"\n\n\nHe pulls out a small notebook. \"Give me the orders, and I'll start making arrangements. Santiago's ports are active - I can have us at sea or on the road within three to five days if we move quickly.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando adds quietly: \"And Your Majesty, one more thing. When we meet the Pope, who does he see? The humble pilgrim who prayed at Santiago? The determined young king who removed a traitor from his council? The strategic leader planning a crusade? You must decide what face to present.\"\n\n\nBoth men wait for your decisions.\n\n\nWhat are your orders, Your Majesty?"

      "say": "Thought process: Calculated travel times, comparing sea and overland routes.\n\nThe user is asking for specific timing comparisons between the sea route and overland route. This is a reasonable question for Juan to ask before making a decision. I should provide Captain Fernán's detailed assessment of both routes with realistic medieval travel times.\n\nLet me think through the logistics:\n\n**Sea Route (All Water):**\n- Santiago/Galician port → down Portuguese coast → through Strait of Gibraltar → across Mediterranean to Rome\n- Distance: roughly 2,000+ miles by sea\n- With favorable winds: 3-4 weeks\n- With unfavorable conditions: 5-6 weeks or more\n- Return: same timing\n\n**Overland Route:**\n- Santiago → across northern Spain → through Pyrenees → across southern France → to Marseille or Genoa → short sea voyage to Rome\n- Distance: perhaps 800-900 miles overland, then 400-500 miles by sea\n- On horseback with good roads: 25-30 miles per day average\n- So 800 miles / 25 miles per day = 32 days, roughly a month\n- Then 1-2 weeks by sea from Marseille/Genoa to Rome\n- Total: 6-7 weeks one way\n\nSo the overland route would add about 2-3 weeks each direction compared to the best-case sea route, but might be comparable to the worst-case sea route. The key difference is predictability vs. uncertainty.\n\nCaptain Fernán should lay this out clearly, with his military mind for logistics and his preference for the more controllable land route showing through.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán's Route Analysis\n\n\nThe Captain pulls his chair closer, spreading his hands as if laying out a map on the table between you.\n\n\n\"Good question, Majesty. Let me break down both routes with realistic timing.\"\n\n\nThe All-Sea Route\n\n\n\"From a Galician port - likely A Coruña, it's the major port here - we sail south along the Portuguese coast, through the Strait of Gibraltar, then east across the Mediterranean to Ostia or Civitavecchia, Rome's ports.\"\n\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\n\"Distance: Roughly two thousand miles, possibly more depending on the exact route and whether we hug the coast or sail more direct.\n\n\nBest Case: Three to four weeks with steady favorable winds and good weather. I've heard of merchant vessels making similar journeys in that time during summer.\n\n\nRealistic Case: Four to five weeks. Weather changes, contrary winds, need to put in at ports for water and supplies.\n\n\nWorst Case: Six weeks or more. Summer storms in the Mediterranean, calms where you sit for days waiting for wind, pirates forcing detours, or ship damage requiring repairs.\n\n\nReturn Journey: Same timing, same variables.\"\n\n\nHe leans back. \"So we're looking at six to ten weeks total for both voyages, possibly twelve if luck runs against us. And Majesty, the sea is unpredictable. I cannot guarantee any of these times.\"\n\n\nThe Overland Route\n\n\n\"Now, the overland alternative. We ride east from Santiago, across northern Castile and Aragon, through the Pyrenees into southern France, then southeast to either Marseille or Genoa for a much shorter sea voyage to Rome.\"\n\n\nHis eyes brighten slightly - this is clearly his preference.\n\n\n\"Overland Distance: Perhaps eight hundred to nine hundred miles, depending on exact route.\n\n\nDaily Travel Rate: With good horses, decent roads, and your party in good condition - which we are after three weeks on pilgrimage - we can average twenty-five to thirty miles per day. Some days more, some less, but that's a sustainable pace.\n\n\nCalculation: Nine hundred miles divided by twenty-five miles per day equals thirty-six days. Call it five to six weeks of riding.\n\n\nSea Portion: From Marseille to Rome is perhaps four hundred miles. From Genoa, similar or slightly longer. That's one to two weeks by sea, three at most if conditions are poor. But it's coastal sailing, much safer than crossing the open Mediterranean.\n\n\nTotal One Way: Six to seven weeks, possibly eight in worst case.\n\n\nReturn Journey: Same timing.\"\n\n\nThe Comparison\n\n\nFray Hernando has been following carefully. \"So the overland route takes perhaps two to three weeks longer each way?\"\n\n\n\"In the best case for the sea route, yes Father. But here's the critical point:\" The Captain holds up a finger. \"The sea route's timing is uncertain. We might make it in three weeks with perfect wind. Or we might sit becalmed for a week, then hit storms, then face pirates. I cannot control it.\n\n\nThe overland route takes longer, but it's predictable. I know we can cover twenty-five miles a day. I know where the roads go, where the towns are, where we can rest. Short of serious illness or injury, I can get you there in six weeks.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"From a military perspective, Majesty, I prefer the plan I can control over the faster plan I cannot.\"\n\n\nThe Math for Your Schedule\n\n\nYou interject: \"Let's be specific about the calendar. Today is June second. The Royal Council convenes in Seville on November eighth. That's...\"\n\n\n\"Five months and six days,\" Fray Hernando supplies quickly. \"Twenty-three weeks.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán nods. \"Let's work backwards from November eighth:\n\n\nYou need to be in Seville by: Early November at latest, ideally late October to prepare.\n\n\nTravel time from Rome to Seville: Whether we return by sea or land, figure six to eight weeks to be safe. So you need to leave Rome by early to mid-September.\n\n\nTime in Rome for your diplomacy: You'll need at least two weeks, possibly a month, to secure papal audience, conduct negotiations, allow for delays in the papal schedule. Pope Martin V is a busy man. So you should arrive in Rome by mid-August at latest, early August to be comfortable.\n\n\nThat means departing Santiago: Early to mid-June if we sail. Mid-June at latest if we ride overland.\n\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"Majesty, by either route, we have time. It's tight, but doable. The question is which risks you prefer: the unpredictability of the sea, or the longer but more certain overland journey.\"\n\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"Your Majesty, the Captain mentioned building church connections through France. Let me be more specific about that value.\"\n\n\n\"Please.\"\n\n\n\"The overland route takes us through Navarre - your Infante Juan's kingdom - but we can skirt the main cities. Then into France - we could stop at Toulouse, important see. Then Avignon.\"\n\n\nYou look up sharply. \"Avignon? The old papal seat?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, Majesty. The schism ended only eleven years ago. Avignon still has immense prestige in the Church, and many cardinals and church officials there remember when it was the papal capital. An audience with the Archbishop of Avignon, prayers at the papal palace chapel, letters of introduction to Rome...\" He spreads his hands. \"It builds your credibility as a true pilgrim-king, not just a political petitioner.\"\n\n\n\"Plus Cluny Abbey,\" the monk continues, \"one of the greatest monasteries in Christendom. And depending on route, possibly Lyon, Marseille - each with its own bishop who could vouch for you to Rome.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán grunts. \"The Father makes tactical sense. Arriving in Rome with a dozen letters from French church hierarchy carries weight.\"\n\n\nThe Trade-Offs Summarized\n\n\nThe Captain ticks off on his fingers:\n\n\n\"Sea Route:\n\n\nFaster: Best case three to four weeks, possibly as good as five weeks\n\nMore dangerous: Pirates, storms, seasickness, ship damage\n\nLess control: Weather and wind decide our schedule\n\nDirect: No intermediate stops, no complications with French politics\n\nCheaper: One ship charter versus weeks of lodging and horses through France\n\n\nOverland Route:\n\n\nSlower: Six to seven weeks, possibly eight\n\nSafer: Dangers we can see and respond to\n\nMore control: Predictable daily progress\n\nPolitically valuable: Build French church connections\n\nMore expensive: Weeks of lodging, horse maintenance, food for larger party over longer time\"\n\n\nHe sits back. \"Either route gets you to Rome with time for your business and return before November. The question is: do you value speed and cost, or predictability and political groundwork?\"\n\n\nFray Hernando adds quietly: \"And there's one more consideration, Your Majesty. Which journey feels right? You came to Santiago on foot as a pilgrim. Continuing to Rome by the ancient routes versus sailing...\" He shrugs gently. \"It may seem a small thing, but the story you tell matters. Did the young King Juan sail to Rome as expedience dictated? Or did he walk the pilgrim roads as kings once did?\"\n\n\nBoth men look at you, awaiting your decision.\n\n\nYour Majesty, which route do you choose?"

      "say": "Thought process: Strategized efficient travel route through France and Mediterranean.\n\nThis is a clever strategy from the player. Let me assess this:\n\n1. **Overland Santiago to Rome via France**: 6-7 weeks as discussed, builds church connections\n2. **Audience in Rome**: 2-4 weeks for papal diplomacy\n3. **Sea from Rome to Seville**: Much shorter distance than Rome to Santiago\n\nLet me think about the Rome to Seville sea route:\n- From Ostia/Civitavecchia (Rome's ports) west across Mediterranean\n- Past Sardinia and Balearic Islands\n- Through Strait of Gibraltar\n- North to Seville (which is actually inland on the Guadalquivir River, but has port access)\n- Distance: Maybe 1,200-1,400 miles vs 2,000+ for the full Atlantic route\n- Time: 2-3 weeks with good conditions, 4 at most\n\nThis is smart because:\n- Longer outbound journey builds credentials and connections\n- Faster return gets him back in time\n- Arrives in Seville directly for the council\n- On return, speed matters more than building alliances\n\nThe Captain and Fray Hernando would recognize this as sound strategic thinking. The Captain especially would appreciate the tactical flexibility (deciding on Genoa sea vs continuing overland) and the asymmetric approach (different routes for different needs).\n\nLet me have them react positively with some practical details about the return sea journey.\n\n\nThe Strategic Choice\n\n\nCaptain Fernán's eyes light up immediately. \"Now that's thinking like a commander, Majesty.\"\n\n\nHe stands, animated. \"Yes. Absolutely yes. Overland through France to Rome - we build your credibility, we control our pace, we arrive with proper letters of introduction. Then sea from Rome directly to Seville...\" He's nodding vigorously.\n\n\nFray Hernando looks impressed as well. \"Different routes for different purposes. Wisdom, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán's Assessment\n\n\n\"Let me confirm the return voyage, Majesty. Rome's ports to Seville...\"\n\n\nHe thinks, calculating distances mentally. \"Ostia or Civitavecchia west across the Mediterranean, past Sardinia, through the Strait of Gibraltar, then up the Guadalquivir River to Seville. That's perhaps twelve hundred to fourteen hundred miles by sea. Maybe half the distance of the full Atlantic route.\"\n\n\n\"Time estimate?\"\n\n\n\"Two to three weeks with decent wind and weather. Even if we hit problems, four weeks at most. And it's mostly coastal - we're never far from ports if we need shelter or repairs. Much less dangerous than the open Atlantic crossing.\"\n\n\nHe grins. \"And you arrive directly in Seville, ready for your council. No overland journey from Galicia, no advance warning to your opponents that you're returning. Just... appear in Seville with a papal crusade bull.\"\n\n\n\"The theatrical impact alone would be worth it,\" Fray Hernando murmurs.\n\n\nThe Revised Timeline\n\n\nCaptain Fernán pulls out his notebook again, recalculating:\n\n\n\"Today: June 2nd\n\n\nDepart Santiago: Within three to five days, say June 5th to 7th\n\n\nArrive Rome via France: Six to seven weeks of travel puts us in Rome by late July, possibly early August\n\n\nTime in Rome: Two to four weeks for papal audiences, negotiations, obtaining the bull - through August and into early September\n\n\nDepart Rome by Sea: Early to mid-September\n\n\nArrive Seville: Late September to early October\n\n\nRoyal Council: November 8th\"\n\n\nHe looks up, satisfied. \"Majesty, this gives you a full month in Seville before the council. Time to meet with local nobles, the city guilds, Bishop Fernando who we met on the road. Time to prepare your presentation, coordinate with Don Álvaro on how things have developed in your absence. Time to control the narrative before the Infantes can react.\"\n\n\n\"And if things in Rome take longer than expected?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"We still have cushion. Even if we don't leave Rome until late September, we reach Seville by mid to late October. That's still two to three weeks before the council. Tight, but manageable.\"\n\n\nThe French Route Details\n\n\nFray Hernando leans forward. \"Your Majesty, if we're committing to the French route, let me suggest key stops:\n\n\nWeek One: Across northern Castile to Pamplona in Navarre. We must pass through Infante Juan's kingdom, but quickly and quietly.\n\n\nWeek Two: Cross the Pyrenees into France, reach Toulouse. Important archdiocese, worth a day or two for audience with the Archbishop.\n\n\nWeek Three-Four: Southeast to Avignon. This is crucial - the old papal seat. We must spend several days here, meet with church officials, pray at the papal palace, obtain letters for Rome.\n\n\nWeek Five: Continue to the coast - Marseille or press on to Genoa, depending on our schedule and your decision about the final leg.\n\n\nWeek Six-Seven: If we continue overland, through Italian territories to Rome. If we sail from Genoa, perhaps ten days to two weeks to Ostia.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"The journey itself becomes part of your credentials, Majesty. You can tell Pope Martin: 'I walked from Santiago through France, stopping at Avignon to honor the memory of the papal seat, seeking guidance from your archbishops and abbots.' It shows commitment beyond mere political maneuvering.\"\n\n\nPractical Arrangements\n\n\nCaptain Fernán shifts to logistics. \"For the overland journey, we need:\n\n\nHorses: Good coursers for the riding party, pack animals for supplies. I can arrange this in Santiago - we return the pilgrimage horses, acquire proper mounts for a long journey.\n\n\nParty Size: As discussed, ten to twelve people. Small enough to move quickly, large enough for security and credibility.\n\n\nFunds: The overland route costs more than straight sea voyage - lodging, food, horse maintenance over six weeks. But you mentioned having sufficient treasury access. I estimate... four to five thousand maravedís for the outbound journey, another three thousand for the sea return, plus extra for unexpected expenses. Say ten thousand maravedís total to be safe.\"\n\n\n\"That's acceptable,\" you confirm.\n\n\n\"Documents: We'll need safe-conduct letters. I can obtain these from the Archbishop of Santiago for passage through Castile and France. Your royal seal helps, but formal letters smooth the way at borders and in cities.\"\n\n\nHe taps his notebook. \"For the return sea voyage from Rome, I'll need to arrange that while we're in Rome. The Italian maritime republics - Genoa, Venice, Pisa - all run regular merchant traffic through the Strait to Iberia. Finding a ship won't be difficult, just a matter of negotiating passage.\"\n\n\nThe Flexibility Point\n\n\nThe Captain looks at you with respect. \"Majesty, I like that you're keeping options open on the final approach to Rome. Ride all the way, or take ship from Genoa - we can decide based on how the overland journey goes, how our schedule looks, what we learn along the way. That's good command thinking. Never commit to a plan so rigidly you can't adapt.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando smiles. \"The Captain approves of your strategy, Your Majesty. As do I. This plan serves multiple purposes - building your credentials, maintaining schedule flexibility, and creating dramatic impact for your return.\"\n\n\nNext Immediate Questions\n\n\nCaptain Fernán flips to a fresh page. \"So, remaining decisions before I begin arrangements:\n\n\nOne: Party composition. You, me, Fray Hernando definitely. Which guards? I recommend Sergeant García and Corporal Rodrigo - they kept your secret on the return from Medina del Campo, they're proven. Two to four more from our best men. That's six to eight fighters total, plus you. Then a secretary?\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"And the English knight, Sir Thomas Beaumont. Do we approach him? Foreign knights joining a noble's journey to Rome is perfectly normal. Adds to our cover and gives us extra swords with no Castilian politics.\"\n\n\nTwo: \"Cover story for the rest of the pilgrimage party who aren't coming with us. What do we tell them? And when? Tell them tonight, or wait until the morning we depart?\"\n\n\nThree: \"Departure timing. I need three to four days to arrange horses, supplies, documents, and scout the route. That puts us leaving Santiago on June 5th or 6th. Does Your Majesty need more time here to rest, or are you ready to continue?\"\n\n\nFour: \"What do we tell the Archbishop of Santiago? He's housing us, he's a Mendoza. Does he learn the truth, or do we maintain the fiction of... what? An extended contemplative retreat? A private pilgrimage to French shrines?\"\n\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"And Your Majesty, one more question from me: How much of this do you wish to write to Don Álvaro? He should know your plans and timeline. But the message must travel back to Valladolid - is there risk of interception?\"\n\n\nBoth men await your decisions on these final practical matters before Captain Fernán begins making arrangements.\n\n\nYour orders, Majesty?"

No deception - be open about traveling east into France\n3. Send letters to Álvaro about the journey\n4. Question about whether Castilian bishops' letters have weight\n5. Asking if everything is clear\n\nI should have Captain Fernán and Fray Hernando respond to these decisions, address the question about Castilian bishops, and confirm the plan is clear. They might want to clarify a few details but overall this is a straightforward set of orders.\n\nLet me make sure I understand:\n- Smaller party for speed\n- Being honest about traveling to France (though not explicitly mentioning Rome yet?)\n- Writing to Álvaro\n- Wanting letters of recommendation from bishops\n\nCaptain Fernán would approve of the smaller party. Fray Hernando would have thoughts on the bishop letters question. Both would want to confirm a few final details before beginning preparations.\n\n\nThe Orders Received\n\n\nCaptain Fernán nods approvingly. \"A lean party moves fast. Understood, Majesty.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando looks relieved at your decision against deception. \"Honesty where possible is wise, Your Majesty. The truth has a way of emerging regardless.\"\n\n\nOn Castilian Bishop Letters\n\n\nYour question about Castilian bishops makes Fray Hernando sit up straighter. \"Your Majesty, an excellent question. The answer is: yes, but with nuance.\"\n\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\n\"The Archbishop of Toledo - Don Juan Martínez de Contreras - his letter would carry significant weight in Rome. Toledo is the Primate See of Spain, ancient and prestigious. A letter from Toledo vouching for you would matter greatly to Pope Martin.\"\n\n\n\"The problem,\" Captain Fernán interjects, \"is that the Archbishop is on your regency council. Writing to him reveals Rome to the council, and thus to Infante Enrique, and thus...\"\n\n\n\"To Infante Juan within hours,\" you finish. \"Yes, I see the problem.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando continues: \"However, other bishops can help. The Bishop of Palencia we met on the way here - sympathetic to you. The Bishop of León who offered to counter the Infantes' narrative. And here, the Archbishop of Santiago - Don Lope de Mendoza.\"\n\n\n\"Would their letters help in Rome?\"\n\n\n\"Yes,\" Fray Hernando says firmly. \"Perhaps not as much as Toledo, but Castilian bishops carry weight. The Church is universal - a bishop's testimony about a king's character and faith matters, regardless of kingdom. And Spain's bishops are respected for learning and piety.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"Here's what I suggest: We obtain letters from Santiago's Archbishop before we leave - he's housing you, has seen your pilgrimage firsthand, and is well-disposed. We can send messages to the Bishops of León and Palencia requesting letters to be forwarded to you in France - Avignon perhaps, or we arrange a meeting point.\"\n\n\n\"And Toledo?\"\n\n\n\"We avoid Toledo for now,\" the monk says carefully. \"Perhaps Don Álvaro can obtain a letter from the Archbishop through some indirect means, or we simply proceed without it. Better to lack one powerful letter than to reveal your destination prematurely.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán's Party Composition\n\n\n\"Majesty, for a lean, fast party, here's my recommendation:\n\n\nEight people total:\n\n\nYour Majesty\n\nMyself as commander and your guard captain\n\nFray Hernando as chaplain\n\nSergeant García, Corporal Rodrigo - your most proven men\n\nTwo more guards from our best - I'm thinking Martín and young Felipe, both solid riders and fighters\n\nOne secretary to handle correspondence - the young clerk Diego who's been with us, he's literate in Latin\n\n\nEight riders can cover thirty miles a day easily, more if we push. We're all experienced from the pilgrimage. Small enough to find lodging without difficulty, large enough to deter casual bandits.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"What about Sir Thomas Beaumont, the English knight? And any companions he might have?\"\n\n\n\"What's your counsel?\"\n\n\n\"Normally I'd say yes - extra swords, foreign credentials, good cover. But if we're being open about traveling to France, foreign knights are less necessary for deception. The question becomes: do we want his sword and experience? He's a veteran, fought in France under English command. Could be valuable. But it increases the party to perhaps ten or eleven if he has a companion or squire.\"\n\n\n\"Your recommendation?\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán considers. \"My instinct says leave him. We're tight, experienced, and know each other. Adding unknown elements... I'd rather keep it to our proven men. But I'll follow your judgment, Majesty.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando on the Letters to Álvaro\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, regarding your letters to Don Álvaro - may I offer thoughts on content?\"\n\n\n\"Please.\"\n\n\n\"You said you'll write that you've reached Santiago and will travel east into France 'where God guides you.' That's truthful without revealing Rome specifically. Wise.\"\n\n\nHe taps his chin. \"I would suggest including:\n\n\nYour intention to seek letters from French bishops and possibly visit Avignon\n\nYour expected timeline - departure early June, return by October\n\nReassurance that this serves the realm's interests, not just personal devotion\n\nInstructions for Don Álvaro on how to manage inquiries about your whereabouts\"\n\n\n\"You're suggesting I not mention Rome explicitly even to Álvaro?\"\n\n\n\"That's for you to decide, Majesty. The question is: how secure are letters between here and Valladolid? They pass through many hands. If you trust the messenger completely and Álvaro's receipt of the letter is secure, then yes, tell him everything - he should know your full plans.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán adds: \"I can arrange a trusted royal courier. Someone who's ridden for your father, known to be discreet. The risk isn't zero, but it's manageable.\"\n\n\nThe Archbishop of Santiago Question\n\n\n\"And the Archbishop here,\" Fray Hernando continues, \"Don Lope de Mendoza. He's housing you, he's family to your advisor Íñigo López. What do we tell him?\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán weighs in: \"He'll need to know something, Majesty. We're asking for letters of recommendation. 'To whom' is a question he'll ask. And when we depart heading east instead of back toward Castile, he'll notice.\"\n\n\n\"Do we trust him?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"He's Mendoza family,\" the Captain says. \"The Mendozas are... cautiously supportive of you, not openly hostile. They're watching which way the wind blows. But Don Lope here is churchman first, Mendoza second. He blessed your pilgrimage publicly and enthusiastically.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando nods. \"I would tell him, Your Majesty. Not necessarily the full plan tonight, but before we depart. Request his letter of recommendation for your continued pilgrimage 'toward the Holy See.' He'll understand. And having Santiago's Archbishop aware and supportive is valuable.\"\n\n\nConfirmation of the Plan\n\n\nCaptain Fernán stands, ready to begin work. \"So, to confirm, Your Majesty:\n\n\nParty: Eight people - you, me, Fray Hernando, four guards (García, Rodrigo, Martín, Felipe), secretary Diego. No English knight.\n\n\nRoute: Overland through France, visiting Toulouse, Avignon, possibly other important sees. Flexibility on whether we ride all the way to Rome or take ship from Genoa.\n\n\nReturn: Sea voyage from Rome directly to Seville, arriving late September or early October.\n\n\nLetters:\n\n\nObtain recommendation from Archbishop of Santiago before departure\n\nRequest letters from Bishops of León and Palencia to meet us in France\n\nAvoid involving Archbishop of Toledo\n\nSend letters to Don Álvaro via trusted courier - you'll decide how explicit to be about Rome\n\n\nOpenness: We're not hiding that we're traveling to France, but we're also not announcing Rome to the world. The pilgrimage continues, guided by faith, seeking wisdom from French church hierarchy.\n\n\nDeparture: June 5th or 6th, giving me three to four days to arrange horses, supplies, documents, and courier service.\n\n\nIs that correct, Majesty?\"\n\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"And I will begin drafting your letter to Don Álvaro, for your review and signature. Also prepare talking points for your conversation with the Archbishop of Santiago - requesting his letter and blessing for your continued journey.\"\n\n\nBoth men look at you, awaiting final confirmation.\n\n\nIs everything clear, Your Majesty?

Adequate funds - 10,000 maravedís budgeted\n8. Captain Fernán's competence - proven military leader\n9. Peace in France - while Hundred Years War continues, summer 1430 is relatively stable period, Joan of Arc's recent victories have shifted momentum\n10. Church connections - Fray Hernando's knowledge and ability to arrange church hospitality\n\nPOTENTIAL RISKS:\n1. Distance - ~900 miles overland is substantial\n2. Border crossings - Navarre (Infante Juan's kingdom), then into France\n3. Hundred Years War context - France is war-torn, though major campaigns are in north\n4. Bandits - always a risk on medieval roads\n5. Illness - medieval travel hazards\n6. Political complications - various French territories have different loyalties\n7. The party might be recognized despite low profile\n8. Weather - could have unusual summer storms\n9. Horse injuries/problems - with 10 riders over 900 miles, some horse problems likely\n\nHowever, let me consider:\n- This is a well-traveled route (pilgrimage roads)\n- Summer 1430 is actually a relatively good time - Joan of Arc has changed French fortunes, there's more stability than there was in 1429\n\n\n- The group's strategic advantages outweigh potential risks\n- Multiple layers of protection and preparation increase chances of success\n\nI calculate a strong probability of successfully completing the journey. Their comprehensive preparation, religious credentials, and strategic approach provide robust safeguards against potential obstacles. The combination of experienced leadership, adequate resources, and carefully planned contingencies significantly mitigates travel risks inherent in medieval long-distance journeys.\n\n\nThe Journey to Rome - Action Assessment\n\n\nYour Final Decisions\n\n\nCaptain Fernán nods with satisfaction. \"The English knight - good. Extra sword, foreign credentials, and he came recommended by his service in France. I'll approach him tonight.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando agrees on avoiding Toledo: \"Wise, Your Majesty. We proceed with what we can obtain safely.\"\n\n\nThe preparations begin immediately.\n\n\n\nProbability Assessment: Journey from Santiago to Rome via France\n\n\nYour Proposed Action: Travel overland from Santiago de Compostela through northern Spain and France to Rome, visiting key church centers (Toulouse, Avignon) to gather letters of recommendation, with a party of 10 people, arriving in Rome by late July/early August.\n\n\n\nMy Assessment: HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS\n\n\nFactors Strongly Supporting Success:\n\n\n1. Well-Established Route\n\n\nThe pilgrimage roads through France to Rome are among the most traveled in Christendom\n\nInfrastructure exists: monasteries, hospices, bridges, maintained roads\n\nThousands make this journey annually; you're following proven paths\n\nLocal authorities along the route are accustomed to pilgrims and know how to facilitate them\n\n\n2. Ideal Timing\n\n\nSummer 1430 is good traveling season - warm, dry roads, long daylight\n\nYou're departing early June, giving maximum good weather window\n\nHarvest season not yet begun, so roads less crowded with commercial traffic\n\nFrench situation is relatively stable in summer 1430 following Joan of Arc's victories\n\n\n3. Excellent Party Composition\n\n\n10 experienced travelers just proven on 300-mile Santiago pilgrimage\n\nCaptain Fernán: competent military commander who knows overland travel\n\n6 proven guards plus English knight with French campaign experience\n\nFray Hernando: church connections and Latin literacy\n\nSecretary for correspondence\n\nEveryone mounted on good horses, not walking\n\n\n4. Adequate Resources\n\n\n10,000 maravedís budget is generous for this journey\n\nRoyal authority commands respect and access\n\nArchbishop of Santiago's letter provides church credentials\n\nLegitimate pilgrimage purpose provides social and religious protection\n\n\n5. Strategic Planning\n\n\nRealistic timeline with built-in flexibility\n\nMultiple route options if needed\n\nNot trying to maintain complete secrecy (which would be suspicious)\n\nStopping at major church centers serves both political and practical purposes\n\nCaptain Fernán can adapt to changing conditions\n\n\n6. Historical Precedent\n\n\nKings, nobles, and wealthy pilgrims make this journey regularly\n\nYour father Juan I traveled extensively\n\nNothing about this journey is unprecedented or unusual\n\nMedieval Europe has systems to handle exactly this kind of travel\n\n\n7. Political Protection\n\n\nYou're a crowned king on pilgrimage - attacking you would be scandalous\n\nChurch protection is powerful in this era\n\nFrench territories have no particular reason to oppose you\n\nEven passing through Navarre (Infante Juan's kingdom), open attack on pilgrimage would be politically unacceptable\n\n\n8. Sir Thomas Beaumont\n\n\nVeteran who fought in France knows the territory\n\nForeign knight adds legitimacy to \"noble pilgrimage\" cover\n\nNo Castilian political entanglements\n\nExtra experienced sword\n\n\nManageable Risks:\n\n\n1. Navarre Transit\n\n\nMust pass through Infante Juan's kingdom\n\nRisk: He could attempt to detain or delay you\n\nMitigation: Move quickly through, low profile, legitimate pilgrimage purpose makes detention difficult to justify\n\n\n2. Normal Travel Hazards\n\n\nIllness, accidents, horse injuries, weather\n\nRisk: Could delay or complicate journey\n\nMitigation: Summer travel, experienced party, adequate funds for contingencies, medical knowledge available through monasteries\n\n\n3. Bandits\n\n\nAlways a risk on medieval roads\n\nRisk: Robbery, injury, delay\n\nMitigation: 7 armed men plus you make unattractive target; pilgrimage roads are better patrolled; monasteries provide secure lodging\n\n\n4. French Political Complexity\n\n\nFrance is still in Hundred Years War (though Joan of Arc has shifted momentum)\n\nVarious territories have different loyalties (Burgundian vs. French crown)\n\nRisk: Getting caught in local conflicts or border complications\n\nMitigation: Summer 1430 is relatively quiet period; southern route avoids main war zones; church letters smooth border crossings; pilgrimage status is respected by all sides\n\n\n5. Recognition\n\n\nMight be recognized as King of Castile despite low profile\n\nRisk: Unwanted attention, demands for audiences, news reaching back to Castile\n\nMitigation: Not trying to hide completely; being recognized in France is less dangerous than in Castile; can claim extended pilgrimage if questioned\n\n\n6. Timeline Pressure\n\n\nMust reach Rome by late July/August for papal business\n\nRisk: Delays could compress time for papal diplomacy\n\nMitigation: 6-7 week timeline for 900 miles is conservative; can push to 30-35 miles/day if needed; flexibility built in\n\n\nWhy Not \"Certain Success\"?\n\n\nMedieval travel always has uncertainties (weather, illness, accidents)\n\nHuman factors (personality conflicts, morale issues over long journey)\n\nPolitical developments you can't foresee\n\nSmall chance of serious misfortune (major illness, severe injury, exceptional circumstances)\n\n\nBut these are normal risks of any substantial medieval journey, not specific reasons to doubt this plan.\n\n\nHistorical Context:\n\n\nIn 1430, this journey is routine for wealthy pilgrims and nobles. The routes are well-known, the infrastructure exists, and the political situation in France, while complex, is not actively hostile to Iberian pilgrims. Your party is well-prepared, well-funded, and has legitimate purpose.\n\n\n\nConclusion: HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS\n\n\nYour journey to Rome via France should succeed. The plan is sound, resources adequate, party capable, and route proven. You will face normal medieval travel challenges, but nothing suggests significant obstacles that would prevent reaching Rome.\n\n\nThe greater uncertainties lie not in the journey itself, but in what happens in Rome (papal diplomacy) and what develops in Castile during your absence. But getting there? That should work.\n\n\n\nPlease roll your dice and tell me the result category:\n\n\nGreat Success\n\nSuccess\n\nFailure\n\nCatastrophic Failure\n\n\nBased on your roll, I will narrate the journey through France to Rome, including specific events, encounters, and what you accomplish along the way."

Ten horses stand ready in the cathedral courtyard - good coursers for riding, two pack animals for supplies. Your lean party of ten assembles:\n\n\nYourself, in practical traveling clothes, royal seal concealed but accessible\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso de Robles, commanding\n\nFray Hernando de Talavera, your confessor and chaplain\n\nSergeant García, Corporal Rodrigo, Martín, Felipe - your proven guards\n\nDiego, the young secretary, nervous but determined\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont, the English knight, accompanied by his squire Peter, a capable young man of twenty\n\n\nSir Thomas proved easy to recruit. When Captain Fernán approached him yesterday, the English knight's eyes lit up: \"Rome? With a young king who outmaneuvered traitors and walks as a pilgrim? My sword is yours, Your Majesty. No charge beyond provisions and the honor of the journey.\"\n\n\nHe's proven himself already - spent yesterday helping select horses, checking equipment, sharing knowledge of French roads from his military service.\n\n\nThe Archbishop's Blessing\n\n\nDon Lope de Mendoza, Archbishop of Santiago, meets you in his private chapel for a final conversation. You've been honest with him - not revealing every detail, but explaining you seek to visit French church centers and possibly continue toward Rome itself.\n\n\nHe's surprisingly unsurprised.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, when a young king comes to Santiago and prays as you prayed - with such intensity, such genuine seeking - it was clear this was the beginning of a journey, not the end.\"\n\n\nHe hands you a sealed letter, written in elegant Latin. \"For any bishop, archbishop, or cardinal you encounter. It attests to your sincere faith, your humble pilgrimage, and my blessing on your continued journey. The seal of Santiago carries weight in Rome.\"\n\n\n\"Thank you, Your Grace.\"\n\n\n\"One more thing.\" He lowers his voice. \"I've written privately to my nephew Íñigo - your advisor. Told him you departed heading east, seeking deeper spiritual guidance. Let him read between those lines as he will. But I've given him nothing the Infantes could use against you.\"\n\n\nPolitical astuteness wrapped in ecclesiastical robes. The Mendozas are indeed careful players.\n\n\n\"And Your Majesty?\" He places a hand on your shoulder. \"Whatever you seek in Rome - whether crusade, blessing, or simply answers - remember that God works through the Church, yes, but also through you. A king who genuinely cares for his people, who walks humbly... that itself is rare and holy.\"\n\n\nThe Letters to Álvaro\n\n\nBefore departing, you finalize three letters that will be sent to Valladolid via Captain Fernán's trusted courier:\n\n\nFirst Letter (To be opened immediately):\n\n\nYou've reached Santiago safely\n\nContinuing pilgrimage \"where God guides\" - traveling east through France\n\nVisiting important church centers, seeking wisdom and letters of recommendation\n\nExpected return by October\n\nTrust Álvaro to manage affairs with the regency council\n\nWill send further updates when possible\n\n\nSecond Letter (More detailed, sealed):\n\n\nYour true destination: Rome, to seek papal audience\n\nGoal: crusade bull for Granada, papal endorsement of your rule\n\nRoute through Toulouse, Avignon, then to Rome\n\nReturn by sea directly to Seville\n\nInstructions on how to manage questions about your whereabouts\n\nWarning to watch the Infantes carefully\n\n\nThird Letter (Private cipher, for Álvaro's eyes only):\n\n\nFull strategic reasoning for Rome journey\n\nAssessment of regency council dynamics\n\nInstructions for the cabinet members\n\nYour expectations for what he should accomplish during your absence\n\nPersonal note of trust and friendship\n\n\nThe courier departs within the hour, racing back toward Castile.\n\n\n\nWeek One: Through Navarre - The Dangerous Crossing\n\n\nJune 6-8: Eastern Castile\n\n\nYour party rides hard through eastern Castile, covering thirty to thirty-five miles daily. The horses are fresh, the weather perfect, and everyone is in good spirits. You pass through Burgos briefly - just long enough to change horses and hear Mass - then press on toward Navarre.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán keeps a wary watch. \"Tomorrow we cross into Infante Juan's kingdom. Stay alert.\"\n\n\nJune 9-11: Navarre\n\n\nThe border crossing is tense. Navarrese guards examine your party carefully, but your pilgrimage credentials and Santiago letter smooth the way. Still, you notice:\n\n\nGuards taking careful note of your party's size and composition\n\nWhispered conversations after you pass\n\nA rider departing quickly toward Pamplona\n\n\n\"They're reporting to someone,\" Sir Thomas murmurs. He fought in enough military campaigns to recognize intelligence gathering. \"Question is whether we're out of Navarre before anyone decides to act on that information.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán pushes the pace. You skirt around Pamplona itself, taking lesser roads. It adds miles but avoids the capital where Infante Juan might have forces ready to \"invite\" you to stay.\n\n\nOn the evening of June 10th, camping in a small monastery, Fray Hernando comes to you: \"Your Majesty, the prior here tells me riders came through yesterday asking about any notable travelers. They were Infante Juan's men.\"\n\n\n\"Looking for us specifically?\"\n\n\n\"He couldn't say. But someone is watching the roads.\"\n\n\nYou make a decision: \"We ride before dawn. Through Navarre fast, into France as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\nJune 12: The Pyrenees Crossing\n\n\nDawn finds you already in the saddle, climbing into the mountain passes. The route is demanding - steep, narrow paths, summer snow still visible on peaks - but your horses are strong and everyone is experienced from the Santiago journey.\n\n\nAround midday, disaster nearly strikes.\n\n\nCorporal Rodrigo's horse steps wrong on loose stones. The animal stumbles, nearly goes down. Rodrigo manages to stay mounted, but the horse is limping badly.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán examines it. \"Pulled tendon. He can walk, but can't be ridden for days.\"\n\n\nYou're in the middle of the Pyrenees, still technically in Navarre, with a lamed horse and riders potentially following. Sir Thomas suggests: \"We could double up - Rodrigo rides with someone else, lead the lame horse.\"\n\n\n\"Slows us significantly,\" Captain Fernán warns.\n\n\n\"Or,\" Sergeant García offers, \"we leave the horse at the next monastery with payment for care, pick up a replacement in France.\"\n\n\nYou decide: \"Leave the horse, push on. We need speed more than we need that animal.\"\n\n\nAn hour later, a small monastery appears. The monks accept the horse and generous payment (100 maravedís). Rodrigo doubles up with Martín, and the party continues.\n\n\nBy evening, you cross into France.\n\n\nJune 13: French Soil\n\n\nThe village of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port welcomes you. The moment you cross the border, the tension lifts palpably. You're out of Navarre, out of Infante Juan's reach.\n\n\nThat night, over dinner at the local monastery, Sir Thomas raises a cup: \"To His Majesty - through the mountains and past his enemies.\"\n\n\nEven Fray Hernando looks relieved. \"God's hand guided us through that crossing.\"\n\n\nYou're more pragmatic: \"Captain Fernán's planning and fast horses guided us. Though I'll accept God gets credit too.\"\n\n\nThe party laughs - the first real laughter since leaving Santiago.\n\n\n\nWeek Two: Through Southern France\n\n\nJune 14-17: To Toulouse\n\n\nThe French roads are excellent - better maintained than Castilian routes. Your party makes good time through Gascony and toward Toulouse. The countryside is recovering from war; you see burned villages being rebuilt, fields returning to cultivation.\n\n\nSir Thomas provides running commentary: \"Fought through here six years ago. Was all devastation then. The French are resilient.\"\n\n\nOn June 16th, you meet something unexpected: a large party of Italian merchants heading north from the Mediterranean ports. Their leader, a Florentine named Cosimo di Medici, is about forty, sharp-eyed and well-dressed.\n\n\nHe recognizes noble bearing if not your specific identity. Over wine at a tavern that evening (his party and yours are sharing lodging), he speaks of Italian politics, papal affairs, and Mediterranean trade.\n\n\n\"You travel to Rome?\" he asks casually.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán deflects: \"Perhaps. We follow where pilgrimage leads.\"\n\n\nCosimo smiles knowingly. \"Of course. Well, if 'pilgrimage' leads you to Rome, know that Pope Martin is practical man. He responds well to those who speak of mutual benefit, not just petition.\"\n\n\nAn interesting encounter. This Cosimo clearly has papal connections.\n\n\nJune 18-20: Toulouse\n\n\nThe great city of Toulouse receives you well. The Archbishop, Bernard du Rosier, is a scholar-diplomat, about sixty, with shrewd eyes and political awareness.\n\n\nYour audience with him is crucial. You've prepared carefully with Fray Hernando, presenting yourself as young king seeking wisdom and guidance from French church hierarchy while on extended pilgrimage.\n\n\nThe Archbishop is impressed by your humility and Santiago letter. \"Your Majesty, a king who walks as pilgrim is rare. Most send proxies or make grand processional entries. You... walk.\"\n\n\nOver two days in Toulouse, you:\n\n\nAttend Mass at the great cathedral\n\nMeet with cathedral chapter and local clergy\n\nShare several meals with the Archbishop, discussing theology, governance, and the challenges of Christian kingship\n\nObserve the Archbishop carefully assessing you\n\n\nOn your departure, he provides a sealed letter: \"For any church authority you encounter, particularly should you find yourself in Avignon or... elsewhere. It attests to your sincere faith and my confidence in your character.\"\n\n\nFirst major letter of recommendation secured.\n\n\nThe Archbishop also shares intelligence: \"Your Majesty, word travels. I've heard whispers from Castile - tensions in Valladolid, questions about your whereabouts, competing narratives about your regency council. Your enemies work while you travel.\"\n\n\n\"What do you hear specifically?\"\n\n\n\"That Infante Juan seeks to portray you as unstable, driven by mystical visions rather than practical governance. That your sudden departure for 'extended pilgrimage' supports this narrative.\"\n\n\nConcerning, but not unexpected. \"And what do you tell those who ask you?\"\n\n\n\"That I met a young king of remarkable clarity and genuine faith. That mystical devotion and practical wisdom are not opposed. That Castile is fortunate in its king.\" He smiles. \"The truth, as I see it.\"\n\n\nReputation building in French church hierarchy progressing well.\n\n\n\nWeek Three: The Road to Avignon\n\n\nJune 21-25: Through Languedoc\n\n\nThe journey east toward Avignon takes you through prosperous country. You cross the Rhône River, pass ancient Roman ruins, see vineyards and olive groves.\n\n\nDuring this stretch, something develops: genuine camaraderie within the party.\n\n\nOne evening, camped by a river, Sir Thomas teaches you an English sword technique. Captain Fernán critiques, suggests modifications for your style. Sergeant García makes everyone laugh with stories of his first campaign. Even quiet Diego the secretary joins in, revealing surprising skill at chess when someone produces a traveling set.\n\n\nFray Hernando observes this with interest. Later, he remarks: \"Your Majesty, you're building something here. Not just guards who follow orders, but companions who believe in you.\"\n\n\n\"Is that dangerous? Getting too familiar?\"\n\n\n\"Getting too distant is more dangerous. Kings who treat men as tools find themselves with broken tools when crisis comes. Kings who build loyalty through shared hardship...\" He gestures at the camp. \"They build something that endures.\"\n\n\nJune 26-28: Avignon\n\n\nThe old papal city.\n\n\nAvignon rises before you - massive papal palace dominating the skyline, walls and towers proclaiming its former glory. Though the papacy returned to Rome in 1420, only ten years ago, Avignon remains a power center.\n\n\nYour party enters through the southern gate. The Vice-Legate of Avignon, Cardinal Pierre de Foix, receives you with great ceremony once he learns a visiting king has arrived.\n\n\nThe Cardinal is perhaps fifty, French nobility, sophisticated and worldly. He remembers when Avignon was the papal seat, when seven popes ruled from this city during the schism.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty honors us. Santiago's Archbishop wrote ahead - we expected you might come this way.\"\n\n\nOver the next three days in Avignon, you:\n\n\nDay One:\n\n\nTour the magnificent papal palace\n\nPray in the palace chapel where popes once celebrated Mass\n\nMeet with the Vice-Legate privately\n\nBegin explaining your journey and hopes\n\n\nDay Two:\n\n\nFormal audience with Cardinal de Foix and assembled clergy\n\nPresent your case: young king seeking papal guidance, hoping for crusade blessing against Granada\n\nThe Cardinal asks pointed questions:\n\"Why should Rome care about Granada when Hussites threaten Bohemia?\"\n\n\"Can Castile actually mount successful crusade, or is this political theater?\"\n\n\"What can you offer the Holy See beyond piety?\"\n\n\nYou answer thoughtfully, with Fray Hernando's coaching:\n\n\nGranada's conversion serves broader Christian unity and demonstrates papal authority still commands crusades\n\nYou've studied frontier conditions and believe with proper backing success is achievable\n\nA successful crusade creates strong, grateful ally in Iberia\n\n\nThe Cardinal is impressed but non-committal.\n\n\nDay Three:\n\n\nPrivate dinner with Cardinal de Foix\n\nHe speaks frankly: \"Your Majesty, I will write you strong letter for Rome. But understand - Pope Martin is politician as much as pontiff. He grants nothing without calculating benefit. Your youth works against you; kings often grow more valuable with age. But your genuine faith and strategic thinking... those work for you.\"\n\n\nHe continues: \"When you reach Rome, understand the curial politics. The Pope has concerns: Italian territorial conflicts, reconciliation with Constantinople, the Hussite problem, managing various kings' ambitions. Show him how your success advances his priorities, not just your own.\"\n\n\nValuable strategic advice received.\n\n\nThe Cardinal provides not one but two letters:\n\n\nFormal letter of recommendation attesting to your faith and character\n\nPrivate letter to Cardinal Giordano Orsini in Rome, the Pope's closest advisor, introducing you as \"a remarkable young king worth the Holy Father's attention\"\n\n\nMajor advancement in papal connections achieved.\n\n\nBefore you leave, Cardinal de Foix adds: \"Your Majesty, one warning. Pope Martin is seventy-two, not in robust health. The vultures circle - cardinals positioning for the next conclave. When you arrive in Rome, you may find yourself in middle of succession politics whether you intend it or not. Be cautious whom you trust.\"\n\n\n\nWeek Four-Five: Into Italy\n\n\nJune 29 - July 12: Through Provence and Piedmont\n\n\nThe journey from Avignon toward Italy takes you through beautiful country:\n\n\nProvence with its lavender and vineyards\n\nAlpine foothills with spectacular vistas\n\nAncient Roman roads still functional after fourteen centuries\n\nIndependent city-states and small principalities\n\n\nSeveral notable events:\n\n\nJuly 2: The Mercenary Captain\n\n\nAt a crossroads inn, you encounter Sir John Hawkwood's former lieutenant, an Italian condottiero named Francesco Bussone, called \"Carmagnola.\" He's about forty, scarred and dangerous-looking, leading twenty mercenaries.\n\n\nHe recognizes military bearing in your party. Over ale, conversation develops. When he learns you're Castilian nobility (you don't reveal being the king), he offers insight:\n\n\n\"Italian wars are different from your reconquista, young lord. Here, it's professionals fighting other professionals. We capture, ransom, negotiate. Total war is bad for business - destroys the customers.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas engages him in shop talk about tactics and weapons. Information is exchanged.\n\n\nBefore parting, Carmagnola remarks: \"If you ever need Italian swords, send word. Professional soldiers respect professional soldiers.\"\n\n\nPotential military contact established.\n\n\nJuly 5: The Accident\n\n\nYoung Felipe's horse throws a shoe, steps on sharp stone, cuts its frog badly. The animal will be lame for a week at least.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán is frustrated: \"That's two horses now. And we're barely halfway through Italy.\"\n\n\nYou purchase a replacement in the next town - costs 400 maravedís for a decent courser. Your budget is holding but being tested.\n\n\nJuly 8: Letters from Home\n\n\nAt a monastery near Turin, a message catches up: forwarded from Toulouse, then Avignon, now here. It's from Álvaro de Luna.\n\n\nThe Constable's report is concerning:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\n\n\nYour letters received. I understand and support your course. But know the situation here grows tense:\n\n\nInfante Juan has left Valladolid, returned to his estates. He writes letters to nobles across Castile, claiming you've abandoned the realm for \"mystical wanderings\" and that firm governance is needed. Some nobles listen.\n\n\nThe regency council functions but with difficulty. Infante Enrique and I maintain uneasy cooperation. The Archbishop tries to mediate. The Marquis watches and waits.\n\n\nYour cabinet performs well: Daza tracks suspicious financial movements (Infantes raising funds), Sandoval reports growing factionalism at court, Manrique sends word from the frontier that Granada watches our internal conflicts with interest.\n\n\nI hold what I can, but your absence is felt. Return with something substantial, or return to a realm more divided than you left.\n\n\nYour faithful servant,\nÁlvaro de Luna\"\n\n\nYou share this with Captain Fernán and Fray Hernando that evening.\n\n\n\"We knew this would happen,\" the Captain says.\n\n\n\"Knowing and experiencing are different,\" you reply. \"How much time do we have?\"\n\n\nFray Hernando calculates: \"Álvaro's letter was written in early to mid-June, took nearly a month to reach us. Conditions may have worsened since then. But we're committed now - must press forward, secure what we came for, return as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\nThe weight of your absence feels heavier suddenly.\n\n\nJuly 10-12: Approaching Genoa\n\n\nThe party reaches the Ligurian coast. You can see the Mediterranean - deep blue, dotted with sails. Genoa rises before you, one of the great maritime republics, its wealth evident in magnificent buildings and bustling port.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán looks at the sea, then at you. \"Majesty, we're making good time. It's July 12th. If we take ship from here to Rome, we arrive in perhaps ten days to two weeks. Still July, plenty of time for papal audiences.\"\n\n\n\"And if we continue overland?\"\n\n\n\"Another week, maybe eight days to Rome. We'd arrive toward the end of July.\"\n\n\nSir Thomas offers: \"The sea route is faster and your men are less tired. Save the horses for return journey if needed. These Genoese know their business - I'd trust their ships.\"\n\n\nYou consider. The horses have held up reasonably well, but two have been lost/injured. The party is in good spirits but seven weeks of riding shows on everyone. And time matters.\n\n\nDecision: Take ship from Genoa to Rome.\n\n\nJuly 13-14: Securing Passage\n\n\nCaptain Fernán negotiates with Genoese ship captains. After careful inquiry, he secures passage on a merchant galley, the Sant'Andrea, captained by an experienced Genoese sailor named Giacomo Spinola.\n\n\nCost: 1,200 maravedís for the entire party, horses included, with departure July 15th.\n\n\nThe Sant'Andrea is a sturdy vessel, perhaps 120 feet long, equipped with both oars and sails. Captain Spinola explains: \"We depart with cargo for Ostia - wine, woolens, some Genoese metalwork. Stop briefly in Livorno, then direct to Rome's port. Eight to ten days if wind cooperates, twelve if it doesn't.\"\n\n\nYour party boards on the evening of July 14th. The horses are nervous about the gangplank but manage. Your gear is stowed. Tomorrow, you sail for Rome.\n\n\nThat night, sleeping on deck under stars (the small cabins are for cargo), you reflect on the journey so far:\n\n\nSeven weeks since leaving Santiago\n\nSuccessfully passed through Navarre despite danger\n\nSecured strong letters from Toulouse and Avignon\n\nBuilt genuine bonds with your companions\n\nReceived concerning news from Castile but pressed forward\n\nNow mere days from Rome and papal audience\n\n\nFray Hernando finds you at the rail. \"Unable to sleep, Majesty?\"\n\n\n\"Thinking about what comes next. Everything depends on Rome now.\"\n\n\n\"Not everything. You've already accomplished much - these letters, these relationships, the reputation you're building. Even if Rome grants nothing, you don't return empty-handed.\"\n\n\n\"But the crusade bull is the key. Without it, my plan to unite the realm...\"\n\n\n\"May God grant it, then. But remember: we seek God's will, not just our preferred outcome.\"\n\n\nYou smile. \"You're right, of course. Though I admit I strongly prefer the outcome where God's will aligns with a crusade bull.\"\n\n\nThe monk chuckles. \"As do I, Your Majesty. As do I.\"\n\n\n\nWeek Six: The Sea Voyage\n\n\nJuly 15-23: Mediterranean Crossing\n\n\nThe voyage goes reasonably well:\n\n\nFirst Three Days: Fair winds, smooth sailing. The Sant'Andrea makes excellent time down the Italian coast. Most of your party is seasick initially (including you), but by day three everyone has adjusted. Only Captain Fernán remains miserable - the soldier is definitely a land creature.\n\n\nDays Four-Five: Brief stop in Livorno to deliver cargo and take on water. You spend a day ashore, grateful for solid ground. The local bishop hears a Castilian king is in port; you grant him brief audience, receive his blessing and a small letter of introduction.\n\n\nDays Six-Eight: The final leg to Ostia. Wind is less favorable; the galley must row for stretches. You watch the oarsmen with fascination - free men, not slaves, working in shifts, their rhythm maintained by a drumbeat.\n\n\nSir Thomas points out sails on the horizon: \"See how that galley shadows us? Ensuring we're not pirates. The waters near Rome are well-patrolled.\"\n\n\nDay Nine - July 23, 1430: Late afternoon, the coast of Latium appears. By evening, you can see Ostia's port. Captain Spinola brings the Sant'Andrea expertly into harbor as sun sets.\n\n\n\"Welcome to Rome, Your Majesty,\" he says with a grin. \"Well, Ostia. Rome proper is about fifteen miles upriver. You'll ride there tomorrow.\"\n\n\nYou pay the agreed passage (1,200 maravedís) plus generous gratuity (200 more) for excellent service. Captain Spinola is delighted: \"If Your Majesty requires return passage, the Sant'Andrea is at your service.\"\n\n\nYou spend the night in Ostia at a comfortable inn. Tomorrow, Rome itself.\n\n\n\nJuly 24, 1430: Entering the Eternal City\n\n\nThe fifteen-mile ride from Ostia to Rome follows the ancient Via Ostiense. The road is magnificent - Roman engineering still functional after fourteen centuries.\n\n\nAs you approach, Rome rises before you: ancient walls, towers, churches, the massive bulk of St. Peter's Basilica dominating the Vatican hill across the Tiber.\n\n\nSir Thomas, who campaigned in France but never reached Italy, is awestruck: \"By God's wounds... I've heard tales, but...\"\n\n\nEven Captain Fernán, miserable from the sea voyage, straightens in his saddle. \"That's Rome.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando is openly weeping. \"The Eternal City. Where Peter died. Where the Church began.\"\n\n\nYou feel it too - the weight of history, the significance of this place. Every stone has story, every church holds relics of martyrs and saints.\n\n\nYour party enters through the Porta San Paolo. Guards examine credentials; when they see letters from Santiago, Toulouse, and Avignon, their attitude shifts to respect.\n\n\n\"Noble pilgrims? Welcome to Rome. The papal palace is in the Vatican, across the Tiber. Or you may lodge in the city proper - many monasteries host pilgrims.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán already has arrangements. You proceed to the Monastery of Santa Maria in Trastevere, where the archbishop of Avignon wrote ahead to ensure quality lodging.\n\n\nThe monks receive you with ceremony once they learn a king has arrived. The prior, an elderly Roman named Brother Benedetto, is worldly-wise:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, welcome. Santiago's letter preceded you, as did Avignon's. You seek papal audience?\"\n\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\n\"Then know: Pope Martin is in residence at the Vatican. He's elderly, but his mind remains sharp. Securing audience requires proper petition through the papal curia. This can take days or weeks. But...\" He smiles slightly. \"Avignon's Cardinal wrote to Cardinal Orsini on your behalf. That opens doors.\"\n\n\nHe continues: \"I suggest: rest a day from your journey. Tomorrow, present yourself formally at the Vatican with your letters. Request audience through proper channels. With Cardinal Orsini's interest, you should have answer within a few days.\"\n\n\nYou have arrived in Rome successfully, with good letters of recommendation, in late July - exactly as planned. Time remains for papal diplomacy before you must depart for Seville.\n\n\n\nChapter 3 Summary: Journey Success\n\n\nWhat You Accomplished:\n\n\n1.

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed crusading context and diplomatic strategy for 1430.\n\nThe user is asking two things:\n1. They want to confer with Captain Fernán and Fray Hernando about how to proceed with the papal diplomacy\n2. They're asking about the historical context of crusades in 1430 - specifically whether violent rhetoric and disregard for human life was common\n\nFor the second question, this is important historical context. By 1430:\n- The major crusades to the Holy Land had ended (last one was late 13th century)\n- Crusading ideology still existed but had evolved\n- There were crusades against Hussites in Bohemia (ongoing in 1430)\n- The Reconquista in Iberia was framed in crusading terms\n- But 1430 is not the height of crusading fervor like 1095-1291\n\nThe rhetoric could be violent, but by this period there was also:\n- More sophisticated theological thinking about just war\n- Recognition of conversion vs. conquest\n- Political rather than purely religious motivations often dominated\n- The Church had developed more nuanced positions on forced conversion\n- Economic and political considerations were often paramount\n\nI should present both Captain Fernán's practical/political view and Fray Hernando's theological/moral view on how to proceed, while also answering the historical question about crusading culture in 1430.\n\n\nEvening Conference - July 24, 1430\n\n\nYou summon Captain Fernán and Fray Hernando to your quarters in the monastery. The three of you sit around a simple wooden table with wine and bread - the monastery's hospitality.\n\n\n\"Tomorrow we begin the real work,\" you say. \"I need your counsel on how to approach this.\"\n\n\nThe Historical Question\n\n\nBefore they respond, you pause. \"Father, let me ask you something. In this time, when crusades are called - is it common for them to be violent affairs? 'Drive out the infidel,' 'Deus Vult,' with little regard for human life? I've heard the tales of the crusades to Jerusalem, but I want to understand what Rome actually expects when they grant such bulls.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando sets down his wine, considering carefully.\n\n\nFray Hernando's Perspective on Crusading Culture (1430)\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, that's a complicated question. Let me try to answer honestly.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"The great crusades to Jerusalem - the First Crusade of 1095, the subsequent efforts - yes, those were marked by tremendous violence. 'Deus Vult' - God wills it - became the battle cry. When Jerusalem fell in 1099, the crusaders massacred Muslims and Jews alike. Tens of thousands died. The streets literally ran with blood.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"But Your Majesty, that was over three hundred years ago. We are not living in 1095.\"\n\n\n\"What's changed?\"\n\n\n\"Much. The crusading movement has... evolved. And not always for the better, but differently. Let me explain the current reality in 1430:\n\n\nFirst, crusading theology has become more sophisticated. The Church has spent centuries debating just war theory. Saint Thomas Aquinas, a century and a half ago, laid out clear principles:\n\n\nWar must have just cause\n\nMust be declared by proper authority\n\nMust have right intention (peace, not conquest for its own sake)\n\nMeans must be proportionate\n\nNon-combatants should be protected when possible\n\n\nThese principles are taught in universities, debated by theologians. The simple 'God wills it, kill them all' approach is... less acceptable to educated churchmen now.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán grunts. \"Tell that to soldiers in the field.\"\n\n\n\"True,\" Fray Hernando acknowledges. \"The gap between theology and practice remains wide. But the official church position has nuance now.\"\n\n\nHe continues: \"Second, forced conversion is officially opposed. Canon law is clear - baptism must be voluntary. Pope Gregory VII, back in 1073, stated that Jews should not be forcibly converted. This principle extends to Muslims as well. The ideal is conversion through persuasion, through demonstrating Christian truth, through offering protection and better life.\"\n\n\n\"But in practice?\"\n\n\n\"In practice... messier. After conquest, there's often tremendous pressure on Muslims to convert. Not official force, but economic disadvantage, social exclusion, sometimes local violence that authorities ignore. The Church officially condemns this, but doesn't always prevent it.\"\n\n\nThe Current State of Crusading (1430)\n\n\nFray Hernando shifts to contemporary examples:\n\n\n\"The Reconquista in Iberia - which is what concerns you - has its own character. It's been going on for seven hundred years. By now, it's as much about territorial expansion, noble ambition, and economic gain as about faith. Yes, crusading bulls are issued, but everyone understands the political dimensions.\n\n\nIn practice, Iberian reconquista has involved:\n\n\nConquest followed by treaties allowing Muslims to remain under Christian rule\n\nProtection of Muslim communities (mudéjars) who pay taxes and live under Christian law\n\nSometimes forced conversions, but more often economic incentives to convert\n\nPeriods of relative tolerance alternating with periods of persecution\n\nMuch intermarriage, cultural exchange, even alliance between Christian and Muslim nobles\n\n\nIt's not... pure holy war. It's complicated medieval politics with religious justification.\"\n\n\nHe takes a drink. \"The Hussite Crusades - happening right now in Bohemia - those are different. More ideological, more violent, because it's Christians fighting Christians deemed heretics. The rhetoric is harsh: 'extirpate the heresy.' Several crusades have been launched since 1420. They've been... brutal. And largely unsuccessful, which embarrasses the Church.\"\n\n\n\"So what does Pope Martin actually think about crusades in 1430?\"\n\n\nPope Martin V's Likely View\n\n\nFray Hernando chooses his words carefully:\n\n\n\"Pope Martin is practical above all. He ended the Great Schism, reunified the Church, restored papal authority. He's elderly, politically sophisticated, concerned with maintaining Church power and prestige.\n\n\nWhen he considers a crusade bull, he thinks about:\n\n\nPolitical benefits: Does this strengthen papal authority? Does it create useful alliances? Does it demonstrate the Pope can still summon Christian princes to holy war?\n\n\nPractical feasibility: Can it actually succeed? Failure embarrasses the Church - the Hussite crusades prove this.\n\n\nTheological justification: There must be legitimate religious purpose, but it doesn't have to be 'kill all Muslims.' Conversion, protecting Christian populations, recovering Christian lands, defending against aggression - these all work.\n\n\nFinancial considerations: Crusade bulls allow special taxation. The Church gets a cut. This matters.\n\n\nWhen you seek a crusade bull for Granada, Pope Martin will ask:\n\n\nCan you actually win?\n\nWhat's your real goal - conquest, conversion, or political consolidation?\n\nHow does this benefit the Church?\n\nWill this be another embarrassing failure?\n\n\nHe cares less about 'Deus Vult' rhetoric and more about practical outcomes.\"\n\n\nThe Moral Reality\n\n\nFray Hernando's voice becomes more intense:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, here's the uncomfortable truth: crusading language is still used, crusading privileges are still granted, but by 1430, most educated people understand that crusades are political-military campaigns with religious justification, not pure expressions of divine will.\n\n\nThe violent rhetoric exists, yes. Some preachers still use it to whip up fervor. Common soldiers might believe they're doing God's work by killing Muslims. But at the level you're operating - negotiating with the Pope, planning strategy - everyone involved understands the political dimensions.\n\n\nThat doesn't make crusades moral. War is still war. People still die. Muslims will still suffer if you conquer Granada, regardless of your intentions. Forced conversion still happens even when officially forbidden. Violence against non-combatants still occurs.\n\n\nBut it's also not the indiscriminate slaughter of 1099. There are rules now, even if imperfectly followed. There are expectations of mercy, protection of non-combatants, allowing surrender. And conversion through persuasion rather than force is the stated ideal, even if the reality falls short.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes directly. \"You asked in confession about distinguishing your will from God's will. This is exactly that question. You can obtain a crusade bull. You can frame Granada's conquest in religious terms. The Pope may grant it. But you must be honest with yourself about what you're actually doing and why.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán's Practical Interjection\n\n\nThe Captain has been listening with increasing restlessness. Now he speaks:\n\n\n\"With respect, Father, His Majesty asked about crusading culture because he needs to understand what the Pope expects to hear. So let me add the soldier's perspective:\n\n\nWhat Rome wants to hear:\n\n\nYou're spreading Christianity\n\nYou're recovering lands lost to Islam\n\nYou're protecting Christian populations\n\nYou'll respect Church authority and give generous donations from conquests\n\n\nWhat Rome doesn't care about:\n\n\nWhether you personally believe it's holy war\n\nExactly how violent it gets (as long as not scandalously excessive)\n\nWhether conversions are genuinely voluntary\n\nYour real political motivations\n\n\nWhat Rome fears:\n\n\nAnother expensive, embarrassing failure\n\nA king who gets the bull then ignores Church interests\n\nScandal that makes the Church look bad\n\n\nYour Majesty, when we present your case, we emphasize your piety (which is genuine), your practical planning (which shows you can win), and your respect for Church authority (which assures them you're a reliable partner). We don't need to resolve the moral philosophy of crusading. We need to convince old men in Rome that granting you this bull serves their interests.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\n\n\"The Captain is right about what the Pope wants to hear. I'm right about what the moral reality is. You need both, Your Majesty. Present yourself as the Pope expects, but don't lose sight of the actual moral weight of what you're proposing.\"\n\n\nThe Strategy Discussion\n\n\nCaptain Fernán shifts to the practical question. \"So, how do we approach the papal curia?\"\n\n\nHe pulls out notes. \"Brother Benedetto suggested we rest tomorrow, present ourselves the day after. I think that's too slow. Cardinal Orsini is expecting us - Avignon's letter announced your coming. Strike while the iron is hot.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando disagrees. \"Appearing too eager looks desperate. One day's rest shows confidence and respect for protocol. And frankly, Your Majesty, we've just completed seven weeks of travel and a sea voyage. Presenting yourself exhausted and travel-stained versus rested and properly prepared - which makes better impression?\"\n\n\n\"Fair point,\" the Captain concedes. \"But once we do present ourselves, how?\"\n\n\nThree Approaches Debated\n\n\nOption 1: Direct Petition to Papal Curia\n\n\nPresent yourself formally at the Vatican with all your letters\n\nRequest audience through official channels\n\nWait for papal bureaucracy to process request\n\nCould take days or even weeks\n\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"Safest, most respectful of protocol. But slow.\"\nFray Hernando: \"Shows proper humility and respect for Church authority.\"\n\n\nOption 2: Private Meeting with Cardinal Orsini First\n\n\nUse Avignon's private letter to request meeting with the Cardinal\n\nPresent your case to him personally\n\nLet him advocate for you to the Pope\n\nBypass some bureaucracy\n\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"Faster, uses the connection we built. Cardinals like Orsini can expedite matters.\"\nFray Hernando: \"But going around official channels might offend papal officials. Could create enemies.\"\n\n\nOption 3: Combination Approach\n\n\nPresent yourself formally through official channels\n\nSimultaneously send private message to Cardinal Orsini through Avignon's letter\n\nWork both paths at once\n\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"Covers all bases. Official respect plus personal connection.\"\nFray Hernando: \"Most balanced. Shows respect for both protocol and political reality.\"\n\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"Your Majesty, when you do present yourself - whether to officials or to Cardinal Orsini - you must decide: how much do you reveal immediately?\"\n\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\n\"Do you say openly 'I seek a crusade bull for Granada'? Or do you begin more generally - 'I seek Holy Father's wisdom and blessing' - and only reveal the crusade request once you have audience with the Pope himself?\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"Starting general might seem evasive. Better to be direct about what you want.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando: \"But specificity before you've built rapport risks having your request rejected by intermediaries who never bring it to the Pope. If Cardinal Orsini thinks it's a bad idea, he might quietly discourage it without the Pope ever hearing your full case.\"\n\n\nThe Timeline Question\n\n\nThe Captain raises another concern: \"We have about six weeks before we must sail for Seville to arrive by early November. That seems like plenty, but papal bureaucracy can be slow. How long do we give this before we must accept failure and depart?\"\n\n\n\"A month?\" you suggest.\n\n\n\"That leaves only two weeks to arrange ship and sail. Tight. I'd say we give it three to four weeks maximum - through mid to late August. If by August 20th we haven't secured papal audience, we reassess.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando nods reluctantly. \"God's timing is not always our timing. But yes, practically speaking, that's realistic.\"\n\n\nBoth Men Look to You\n\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"So, Majesty, your orders:\n\n\nWhen do we approach the Vatican?\n\n\nTomorrow (July 25) or rest one day and approach July 26?\n\n\nHow do we approach?\n\n\nOfficial channels only?\n\nCardinal Orsini first?\n\nBoth simultaneously?\n\n\nWhat do we reveal initially?\n\n\nFull crusade request immediately?\n\nGeneral pilgrimage/blessing first, specifics later?\n\n\nAnd one more thing:\" He hesitates. \"Do we reveal you're the King of Castile immediately, or present yourself as 'noble pilgrim from Castile' initially? Your royal status gets attention, but also raises expectations and complications.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"And Your Majesty, remember Cardinal de Foix's warning: Pope Martin is elderly, succession politics are brewing. When we enter the Vatican, we enter a world of competing ambitions and factions. We must navigate carefully.\"\n\n\nBoth men await your decision.\n\n\nYour Majesty, how do you wish to proceed?"

      "say": "Thought process: Pondered sword details and historical context for meaningful response.\n\nThe user is absolutely right. I made a serious error. Fray Hernando would NEVER reveal anything from confession to Captain Fernán, even in general terms. The seal of confession is absolute and inviolable - he explicitly stated he would die under torture before revealing it. This is a core tenet of Catholic faith that a devout priest like Fray Hernando would never violate.\n\nI should acknowledge this error and proceed with the user's action - examining the father's sword. This is an interesting character moment and could reveal something meaningful about Juan's father and heritage.\n\nLet me think about what would be on Juan I of Castile's sword (Juan II's father):\n- Juan I ruled 1379-1390, died from a fall from a horse\n- He was involved in conflicts with Portugal and England\n- Medieval Spanish royal swords would likely have:\n  - Religious inscriptions (very common)\n  - The king's name or initial\n  - Possibly a motto\n  - Quality craftsmanship befitting royalty\n  - Maybe inherited from previous kings\n\nI should make this meaningful and potentially relevant to Juan II's current situation.\n\n\nEvening Conference - Continued\n\n\n[Note: You're absolutely right. Fray Hernando would never reveal anything from confession to Captain Fernán - the seal is absolute and inviolable to him. That discussion of \"distinguishing your will from God's will\" would have been a separate theological conversation, not reference to confession. My apologies for that error.]\n\n\n\nThe conversation about approaching the Vatican continues, but you find yourself distracted. The mention of your father's sword - the excuse you used to return from the hermitage - reminds you that you've been carrying it this entire journey but haven't truly examined it closely since taking it from the palace armory.\n\n\n\"Excuse me a moment,\" you say, standing and crossing to where your gear is laid out.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán and Fray Hernando exchange glances but remain silent as you unbuckle the sword belt and draw the blade.\n\n\nYour Father's Sword\n\n\nThe weapon is beautiful - clearly a king's blade, not a common soldier's tool. It's a longsword, well-balanced, the length suggesting it was made for a man of similar height to you. Your father, Juan I, died when you were only two years old, so you have almost no memories of him. But you've held his sword before, worn it at ceremonies. Tonight, for the first time, you truly look at it.\n\n\nThe Blade\n\n\nThe steel is excellent quality - Spanish craftsmanship, possibly from Toledo, the legendary sword-making city. Despite being forty years old (forged sometime in the 1390s or earlier), the blade shows minimal pitting or rust. Someone - probably the royal armorer - has maintained it carefully all these years.\n\n\nRunning down the fuller (the groove along the blade's center) is an inscription in Latin. You angle it toward the candlelight to read:\n\n\n\"NON NOBIS DOMINE\"\n\n\n\"Not unto us, O Lord.\" The beginning of Psalm 115 - a psalm about humility, about giving glory to God rather than claiming it for oneself. A fitting inscription for a Christian king's sword.\n\n\nThe Crossguard\n\n\nThe crossguard is gilded bronze, with the arms of Castile and León on one side - the quartered castle and lion that represents your kingdom. On the other side, you notice something you'd never observed before: a small personal device, barely visible unless you look closely.\n\n\nIt's a tower - but not the castles of Castile's arms. A single tower, simplified, almost abstract.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán has come to look over your shoulder. \"That's curious, Majesty. A personal mark, perhaps? Did your father have a particular device or motto beyond the royal arms?\"\n\n\nYou shake your head. \"I was too young when he died. I don't know.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando joins you. \"May I?\" He examines the tower closely. \"A tower often symbolizes strength, refuge, or vigilance. In Christian symbolism, sometimes it represents the Church as refuge, or the Virgin Mary as 'tower of ivory.' But as a personal device...\" He shrugs. \"Your father chose it for his own reasons.\"\n\n\nThe Pommel\n\n\nThe pommel is a disk of steel, likely filled with lead for balance. But on its face is another inscription, this one in Castilian rather than Latin. The words are worn - your father's hand gripped here for years - but still legible:\n\n\n\"PARA CASTILLA Y LA FE\"\n\n\n\"For Castile and the Faith.\"\n\n\nSimple. Direct. Your father's purpose distilled to five words.\n\n\nThe Scabbard\n\n\nThe scabbard is leather over wood, covered with velvet - red, faded now to burgundy. Silver fittings at throat and chape (tip). Near the throat, tooled into the leather and still visible, is your father's name:\n\n\nJUAN REX CASTELLAE\n\n\nJuan, King of Castile.\n\n\nYour name. Your title. Your legacy.\n\n\nA Moment of Connection\n\n\nYou hold the sword up, feeling its balance. Your father held this same grip, fought with this blade, wore it at court and in campaign. He died when you were two - thrown from his horse while reviewing troops at Alcalá de Henares in October 1390. You never knew him.\n\n\nBut here, in your hands, is something he touched daily. Something he valued enough to have inscribed with his beliefs: Not unto us, Lord - humility before God. For Castile and the Faith - his purpose as king.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán speaks quietly: \"Your father was a warrior king, Majesty. Fought the Portuguese, the English, tried to press Castile's claims everywhere. Some called him ambitious, even reckless. But he believed in what he fought for.\"\n\n\n\"Did you know him?\"\n\n\n\"I was a boy when he died, but my father served under him briefly. Said King Juan was brave to the point of foolhardiness sometimes, but men followed him because he led from the front. Never asked his soldiers to face what he wouldn't face himself.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"He also endowed monasteries, supported the Church, took his faith seriously. The sword's inscriptions aren't just pretty words - they reflected how he saw his kingship.\"\n\n\nYou slide the blade back into its scabbard. \"I took this sword as an excuse to return to the palace and catch the Infantes. But perhaps... perhaps there was more to that impulse than I realized.\"\n\n\n\"God works in mysterious ways,\" Fray Hernando says softly.\n\n\n\"Or perhaps I just wanted to carry my father's sword while doing something important.\" You buckle the belt back on. \"Either way, it's here. And tomorrow, we bring it to Rome.\"\n\n\nReturning to Strategy\n\n\nYou return to the table, but the moment with the sword has clarified something for you.\n\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" you say, \"I've decided.\"\n\n\nBoth men lean forward attentively.\n\n\nYour Majesty, what is your decision regarding:\n\n\n1. Timing - Approach tomorrow (July 25) or rest and approach July 26?\n\n\n2. Method - Official channels, Cardinal Orsini first, or both simultaneously?\n\n\n3. Revelation - Full crusade request immediately, or general pilgrimage first?\n\n\n4. Identity - Present as King of Castile immediately, or begin as noble pilgrim?\n\n\nWhat are your orders?"

I will also be frank about how a blessing and a papal bull will stabilize the realm and also consolidate my own power. Faithful and god-fearing I may be, I am also a sinner and I would not deny that these worldly concerns do not affect me at all. I also indicate I am convinced that with papal support we can win the war and finally complete the reconquista. And with our own lands secure, we stand ready to spread christianity overseas and bring the holy father's word to other parts of Europe. The people of Castille are devout and stand ready, but they need a spark and a purpose to set them to task.\n\n\nThen I will reveal my spiritual request. I tell him I am driven by my purpose to bring God's kingdom to earth, or at least I try to do so. After much prayer, I decided to return to my Palace a few days in my pilgrimage to take my father's sword with me. Common sense told me to check on my regency council while I was back and was able to stop a plot against me. Coincidence? Part of me tells me I was just lucky, but I have been studying the inscription on my fathers sword more closely. Not unto us, my lord. I feel like I should lay this sword at your feet for this sword belongs to God. My request is this, can the holy father determine if God has guided me to retrieve my sword or not?\n\n\nHow do you think the holy father would respond?"

      "say": "Thought process: Probed papal response, balancing political savvy and spiritual discernment.\n\nThis is a fascinating and complex approach the player is proposing. Let me think through how Pope Martin V would likely respond to this in 1430.\n\nFirst, let me consider what the player is proposing:\n1. Being very frank about the political/worldly motivations (consolidating power, stabilizing realm)\n2. Offering the practical argument that Castile could be a valuable ally for spreading Christianity beyond Iberia\n3. Then presenting a deeply spiritual request - asking the Pope to discern whether God guided him to retrieve his father's sword\n4. Offering to lay the sword at the Pope's feet symbolically\n\nThis is actually quite sophisticated. Let me think about Pope Martin V's character and likely response:\n\n**Pope Martin V (Oddone Colonna) in 1430:**\n- Age 72, elected 1417 (13 years into papacy)\n- Ended the Great Schism, restored papal authority\n- From powerful Roman Colonna family - deeply political\n- Focused on rebuilding papal finances and power after schism\n- Sophisticated, worldly, but also genuinely concerned with Church authority\n- Known for being pragmatic and shrewd\n- Would be impressed by competence but suspicious of manipulation\n- Would value honesty over false piety\n\n**How would Martin V likely respond to this approach?**\n\nThe honesty about political motivations would likely intrigue him. Popes in this era are sophisticated political operators - they KNOW kings have mixed motives. A young king who admits it openly rather than wrapping everything in false piety might actually earn respect. It shows self-awareness and sophistication.\n\nThe practical argument about Castile as an ally for further Christian expansion is smart - it gives Martin something concrete to gain.\n\nBut then the spiritual request about discerning God's guidance... this is where it gets interesting and risky.\n\n**Potential responses from Martin V:**\n\n**Option 1 - Impressed and Moved:**\nMartin might be genuinely impressed by this combination of political honesty and spiritual seeking. It's unusual. \n\nThis approach reveals a nuanced understanding of papal dynamics. The king presents a multifaceted request that speaks to both worldly and spiritual concerns, demonstrating a sophisticated political and religious intelligence that could intrigue a seasoned papal leader like Martin V.\n\nMartin would likely engage carefully, balancing political pragmatism with pastoral sensitivity. His response would involve strategic listening, probing Juan's deeper motivations while recognizing the symbolic weight of the sword gesture as a potential sign of genuine spiritual submission.\n\nThe potential interaction suggests a delicate diplomatic dance - where political calculation meets sincere spiritual inquiry, creating a complex moment of potential mutual understanding between a young king and an experienced pontiff.\n\nMartin understands the nuanced risks: endorsing a crusade could backfire, yet dismissing a sincere spiritual request might alienate a potential ally. His approach would blend cautious discernment with openness to Juan's authentic spiritual yearning.\n\n\nThe Strategic Assessment\n\n\nYou lay out your approach. Both Captain Fernán and Fray Hernando listen intently, their expressions shifting as you explain.\n\n\nWhen you finish, there's a long silence.\n\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\n\nThe monk speaks first, his voice careful:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, this is... remarkably sophisticated. And deeply risky.\"\n\n\nHe stands, begins pacing. \"Let me think through how Pope Martin might respond to each element:\n\n\nThe Political Honesty\n\n\n\"You begin by admitting your worldly motivations - consolidating power, stabilizing your realm. Most petitioners to the Pope wrap everything in pious language, pretending they have no political interests. You're proposing radical honesty.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Pope Martin V is no fool. He's seventy-two years old, ended the Great Schism through political maneuvering, rebuilt papal authority. He knows kings have mixed motives. Everyone who enters his presence wants something political.\"\n\n\n\"So he'd appreciate the honesty?\"\n\n\n\"Possibly. Or he might think it's a more sophisticated form of manipulation - 'I'm so honest about my political motives that you should trust my spiritual sincerity.' It's a gamble.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando continues: \"But there's a case for it. Cardinals and popes tire of false piety. A young king who says openly 'Yes, I need this politically, AND I believe it serves God' - that's at least refreshing. It treats the Pope as intelligent enough to see through pretense.\"\n\n\nThe Practical Argument\n\n\n\"Your point about Castile standing ready to spread Christianity beyond Iberia if Granada is secured - that's smart. It gives Pope Martin a vision of return on his investment. Not just one crusade, but Castile becoming a reliable instrument of Church expansion.\"\n\n\n\"Would he believe it?\"\n\n\n\"He'd be interested. The Church faces threats - Hussites in Bohemia, tensions with Constantinople, Italian power struggles. Having a strong, loyal Catholic kingdom in Iberia that could project power overseas... yes, that has strategic value.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán interjects: \"And it's true, isn't it? Castile secured, unified, with crusade momentum - we could push into North Africa, support Church interests in the Mediterranean, counter Ottoman expansion. It's not empty promise.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando nods. \"The practical argument strengthens your case. But it's the spiritual request that concerns me.\"\n\n\nThe Spiritual Request - The Risk\n\n\nThe monk stops pacing, faces you directly.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, asking the Pope to discern whether God guided you to retrieve your father's sword... this is profound and dangerous.\"\n\n\n\"Why dangerous?\"\n\n\n\"Because you're asking the Vicar of Christ to make a spiritual judgment about divine guidance in your personal life. That's not a small thing. Consider what it means:\n\n\nIf Pope Martin says YES - God guided you:\n\n\nHe's endorsing your interpretation of events\n\nHe's putting papal authority behind your claim of divine guidance\n\nIf your crusade then fails, he looks foolish\n\nHe's potentially creating a precedent where other kings claim divine guidance and demand papal confirmation\n\n\nIf Pope Martin says NO or refuses to judge:\n\n\nHe's implicitly questioning your spiritual experience\n\nBut he might still grant the crusade bull on political grounds\n\nYou've revealed uncertainty about your own discernment\n\nHe might see you as spiritually immature or confused\n\n\nIf he probes deeper:\n\n\nHe might ask questions you're not prepared to answer\n\nHe might expose contradictions or doubts\n\nHe could use this to test you, manipulate you, or guide you in directions you don't anticipate\"\n\n\nFray Hernando sits back down. \"But here's what makes it potentially powerful: it's unusual. Popes meet kings seeking crusade bulls all the time. They almost never meet a young king who openly admits political motivation while also genuinely wrestling with spiritual discernment. That uniqueness might intrigue him.\"\n\n\nThe Sword Symbolism\n\n\n\"Offering to lay your father's sword at the Pope's feet, acknowledging it belongs to God - that's powerful medieval symbolism. Kings offering swords to Popes, submitting temporal power to spiritual authority. Martin V would understand that gesture deeply.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán adds: \"It's also theatrical. Popes appreciate theater. The young king, bearing his dead father's sword with its inscription 'Not unto us, Lord,' offering it to the Vicar of Christ... it's a scene he'd remember.\"\n\n\n\"But,\" Fray Hernando warns, \"symbolism cuts both ways. If he accepts the gesture and you fail, it becomes mockery. If he rejects it, you've offered and been refused. The symbolism must be backed by substance.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán's Practical Concerns\n\n\nThe soldier has been thinking while the monk spoke. Now he interjects:\n\n\n\"Majesty, I understand the strategy - the honesty disarms suspicion, the spiritual seeking engages him personally, the symbolism creates memorable moment. But let me offer soldier's perspective:\n\n\nThis approach requires perfect execution. You're walking a razor's edge between sophisticated and naive, between honest and manipulative, between pious and presumptuous. One wrong word, one hint of insincerity, and it collapses.\n\n\nYou're very young. Pope Martin might simply think: 'This boy is confused, mixing up politics and spirituality, reading too much into coincidence.' He might be patronizing rather than impressed.\n\n\nYou're gambling everything on his response. If he's moved by your approach, you might get more than the crusade bull - you might get genuine papal mentorship, support, endorsement. If he's unimpressed or suspicious, you've shown him uncertainty and complexity where simpler approach might have worked.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"I'm not saying don't do it. I'm saying: are you prepared for however he responds? Can you handle it if he dismisses your spiritual concerns? Can you accept it if he says 'No, God did not guide you, it was just fortune or your own planning'?\"\n\n\nFray Hernando's Discernment\n\n\nThe monk has been praying quietly while the Captain spoke. Now he looks up:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I must ask: Why do you want to present it this way? Not strategically - I understand that. But in your heart, why?\"\n\n\nHe continues gently: \"Is it because you genuinely want papal discernment about God's guidance in your life? Do you truly want the Pope to tell you whether God led you back to the palace? Or is it because you think this approach will be most effective at securing the crusade bull?\"\n\n\n\"Can't it be both?\"\n\n\n\"It can. But you need to know which is primary, because Pope Martin will try to discern the same thing. He's spent fifty years in the Church, decades in high politics. He reads people. If your spiritual seeking is genuine but secondary to political aims, he'll sense it. If your spiritual seeking is primary and you're being honest about the political dimensions, he'll sense that too.\"\n\n\nThe Core Question\n\n\nFray Hernando asks directly: \"Your Majesty, what do you want the Pope to say when you ask if God guided you? Do you want him to confirm that God led you? Or do you want honest discernment even if he says it was coincidence and your own cleverness?\"\n\n\n\"Because that answer will show in how you present the question. And Martin V will notice.\"\n\n\nThe Alternative Approach\n\n\nCaptain Fernán offers: \"Majesty, there's a simpler path. Present yourself as young king seeking crusade bull for Granada. Use your excellent letters of recommendation. Make the political and practical arguments. Show your faith and piety naturally through how you speak and act. Don't force the spiritual drama.\"\n\n\n\"It's less memorable, but also less risky. You'd likely still get audience, possibly get the bull based on practical merits.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando counters: \"But the Captain's approach doesn't distinguish you. Martin sees that petition constantly. Your Majesty's proposed approach - the radical honesty, the spiritual seeking, the symbolic gesture - that's unique. It could create real relationship with the Pope rather than just transactional exchange.\"\n\n\nBoth Men Wait\n\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"I'll support whatever you choose, Majesty. But know the risks.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando: \"And Your Majesty, know your own heart first. Why do you truly want to present it this way? The answer to that will determine if this approach is wise or foolish.\"\n\n\nThey both look at you expectantly.\n\n\nYour Majesty, having heard their counsel:\n\n\n1. Do you still want to proceed with your proposed approach (political honesty + spiritual request + sword symbolism)?\n\n\n2. Or do you modify it somehow?\n\n\n3. And crucially - can you answer Fray Hernando's question: What do you WANT the Pope to say when you ask if God guided you? Do you want confirmation, or do you want honest discernment regardless of the answer?\n\n\nYour response will shape how we proceed with securing papal audience and what you say when you meet Pope Martin V."

      "say": "Thought process: Pondered Juan's spiritual quest for divine guidance and purpose.\n\nThis is a beautiful and profound moment. Juan is being genuinely vulnerable here - he's not playing politics, he's genuinely wrestling with the question of divine guidance that has been a thread throughout the story.\n\nLet me think about what Juan is saying:\n1. He genuinely wants to know if God guides him\n2. He's been discussing with Hernando how God communicates - Hernando experiences \"intellectual illumination\" and \"consolation,\" but Juan mostly just thinks and plans while praying\n3. Juan wants to know: was returning to the palace divine guidance, or just luck/his own planning?\n4. More specifically: Does God recognize him as His servant?\n5. His specific request: bless the sword and task him to bring Christianity to Granada\n\nThis is moving from political maneuvering to genuine spiritual seeking. This changes the dynamic significantly. Both Fray Hernando and Captain Fernán would recognize this shift - this is no longer just strategy, this is Juan genuinely wanting spiritual confirmation and guidance.\n\nFray Hernando would be deeply moved by this honesty. He's been trying to help Juan discern the difference between his own will and God's will. Juan is now openly asking for help with that discernment from the highest spiritual authority available.\n\nCaptain Fernán would respect the honesty but might be concerned about the vulnerability it represents.\n\nThe question now is: how would Pope Martin V likely respond to this genuine spiritual seeking combined with political honesty?\n\nLet me think about Pope Martin V (Oddone Colonna):\n- Elected 1417, ending the Great Schism\n- 72 years old in 1430\n- From powerful Roman Colonna family\n- Politically sophisticated, but also genuinely devout\n- Focused on restoring papal authority and prestige\n- Known for being practical and diplomatic\n- Not particularly mystical, but respects genuine piety\n- Would have significant experience reading people\n\nHow would he respond to an 18-year-old king who:\n1. Is brutally honest about political motivations\n2. Genuinely seeks spiritual guidance about divine will\n\n\n3. Offers his father's sword as a symbolic gesture\n4. Asks for blessing and tasking specifically for Granada crusade\n\nJuan's approach is strategically brilliant. By presenting his mixed motivations openly, he demonstrates a rare authenticity that could deeply impress the Pope. The symbolic sword and specific request for blessing transform a potential political negotiation into a spiritual covenant. This isn't just a young king seeking validation, but a potential instrument of divine mission.\n\n\nThe Truth Revealed\n\n\nYour words hang in the air. Both men see something shift in your expression - this is no longer strategic calculation. This is genuine.\n\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\n\nThe monk's entire demeanor changes. He leans forward, eyes intent.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty... this is what you should present to the Pope. Exactly this.\"\n\n\nHe stands, animated in a way you've rarely seen. \"You've just articulated something profound. You're not asking him to rubber-stamp your interpretation. You're genuinely asking: Does God guide me? Does He recognize me as His servant? That's real spiritual seeking.\"\n\n\n\"And the specific request - to bless the sword and task you to bring Christianity to Granada - that's brilliant because it gives the Pope agency. You're not saying 'God already told me to do this, confirm it.' You're saying 'I don't know if God guides me, but I want to serve Him. Will you, as His Vicar, give me this task?'\"\n\n\nFray Hernando paces excitedly. \"Do you see the difference? One is asking for validation. The other is asking for vocation - for calling. Popes understand calling. They confer vocations, they task bishops and abbots, they send legates on missions. You're asking to be sent as a crusader, not just permitted.\"\n\n\nHe stops, faces you. \"Your Majesty, I've been wondering since we left Santiago whether this journey was truly about the crusade bull or about something deeper. Now I know. You're seeking spiritual confirmation that you're on the right path. That's... that's legitimate. That's holy.\"\n\n\n\"Even if mixed with political necessity?\"\n\n\n\"Especially because it's mixed with political necessity. You're not pretending to be a mystic saint. You're a king trying to serve God while navigating the realities of power. That's honest. That's the actual struggle of Christian kingship.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán's Measured Response\n\n\nThe soldier is quieter, more thoughtful. Finally, he speaks:\n\n\n\"Majesty, I'm a simple man. I fight, I follow orders, I pray when I'm told to. I don't understand theology like Father Hernando. But I understand honesty, and what you just said... that's honest.\"\n\n\nHe shifts uncomfortably. \"I'll tell you something. When we were riding through the Pyrenees, when Rodrigo's horse went lame and we were still in Navarre with riders maybe following us, I prayed. Not fancy prayer - just 'God, get us through this.' And we made it. Was that God? Was it luck? Was it good planning? I don't know.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"But if the Pope - the actual Pope, Christ's Vicar on Earth - could tell me 'Yes, God heard you, God helped you,' I'd want to know that too. So I understand why you're asking.\"\n\n\n\"You think the Pope will dismiss it?\"\n\n\n\"I think the Pope might be moved by it. You're eighteen years old, carrying your dead father's sword, genuinely trying to figure out if God speaks to you. That's not cynical politics. That's... human.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando's Guidance on Presentation\n\n\nThe monk sits back down, suddenly focused and practical:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, here's how I think you should present this to Pope Martin:\n\n\nFirst, the political honesty: Exactly as you described. 'Holy Father, I have worldly needs - consolidating power, unifying my realm, completing the Reconquista. I won't pretend otherwise. A crusade bull serves these purposes.'\n\n\nSecond, the spiritual seeking: 'But Holy Father, I also have a spiritual question. I pray constantly, trying to discern God's will from my own desires. When I pray, most thoughts are my own planning. But sometimes I sense... something more. I don't know if it's God or imagination.'\n\n\nThird, the specific story: 'I felt moved to return and retrieve my father's sword. Common sense suggested checking on my council. I discovered and stopped a plot. Coincidence? My own cleverness? Or did God guide me? I genuinely don't know.'\n\n\nFourth, the request: 'I bring this sword - inscribed Non Nobis Domine, Not Unto Us Lord - and I ask: Will you bless it? Will you task me, as God's Vicar, to use it to bring Christianity to Granada? Not because I'm certain God has called me, but because I want to serve Him and I seek your guidance on whether this is how I should serve.'\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Do you see how this works? You're honest about uncertainty, you're asking for guidance rather than validation, and you're giving the Pope the power to make it God's will by blessing and tasking you. That's theologically sound and politically astute.\"\n\n\nThe Risk Assessment\n\n\nCaptain Fernán adds: \"But Majesty, understand what you're revealing. You're showing the Pope that you have doubts, that you question whether God speaks to you, that you need guidance. That's vulnerability. It could be seen as weakness.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando counters: \"Or as humility. The kind of humility that the inscription on the sword itself commands - Not unto us, Lord. A king who admits he doesn't have all the answers, who genuinely seeks divine guidance... that's rare.\"\n\n\n\"Pope Martin might respect it,\" the Captain concedes. \"Or he might think you're too uncertain to be trusted with a crusade bull. It's a gamble.\"\n\n\n\"Everything is a gamble,\" you say quietly.\n\n\nThe Theological Dimension\n\n\nFray Hernando becomes more serious: \"Your Majesty, I must prepare you for possible answers the Pope might give:\n\n\nHe might say: 'Yes, God guided you. I bless this sword and task you with bringing Christianity to Granada.' That's the answer you hope for.\n\n\nHe might say: 'I cannot know God's mind with certainty, but I bless your intention and your sword. Proceed with the crusade.' That's non-committal but supportive.\n\n\nHe might say: 'Young king, you must learn to distinguish your thoughts from God's voice. The ability to discern comes with spiritual maturity. For now, trust the Church's guidance rather than seeking signs.' That's gentle dismissal.\n\n\nHe might say: 'What you experienced was your own wisdom, not divine intervention. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't pursue the crusade.' That's practical but not spiritually affirming.\n\n\nOr he might surprise you entirely - ask questions, probe deeper, offer spiritual direction you didn't expect.\"\n\n\n\"Can you accept any of those answers, Your Majesty? Even the ones that say God didn't guide you?\"\n\n\nYou consider this carefully. Can you?\n\n\nYour Father's Sword\n\n\nYou draw the blade again, looking at the inscription: Non Nobis Domine.\n\n\n\"When my father had this inscribed, he was acknowledging something. That victories aren't his alone. That kingship is stewardship, not ownership. That glory belongs to God.\"\n\n\nYou look at both men. \"If Pope Martin tells me God didn't guide me back to the palace, that it was just my own planning and good fortune... I can accept that. Because either way, the inscription still commands me: Not unto us, Lord. My job is to serve, whether I hear divine whispers or not.\"\n\n\n\"And if he blesses the sword and tasks you with the crusade?\" Fray Hernando asks.\n\n\n\"Then I'll know that God, through His Vicar, has called me to this. Not because of mystical visions, but because the Church itself has said: this is your task. That would be... enough. More than enough.\"\n\n\nThe Decision Crystallizes\n\n\nCaptain Fernán stands. \"Then I know how to proceed. We approach this honestly, vulnerably, seeking genuine guidance. It's risky, but it's true to who you are.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"And Your Majesty, whatever the Pope says, you'll have your answer. Either God guides you directly, or the Church guides you as God's instrument. Either way, you'll know your path.\"\n\n\n\"When do we seek audience?\" you ask.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"Tomorrow - July 25 - we rest, pray, prepare. You need to be clear-headed and spiritually centered for this. July 26, we present ourselves at the Vatican with all your letters, request formal audience, and also send private message to Cardinal Orsini through Avignon's letter.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando: \"And Your Majesty, tonight and tomorrow, we pray. Not planning prayers, not strategic prayers. Just... seeking. If God speaks to you in prayer, let it be real.\"\n\n\nThe Evening Ends\n\n\nBoth men prepare to leave you to your rest. But Fray Hernando pauses at the door:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, one more thing. When you said you want to know if God recognizes you as His servant... God recognizes everyone as His child. The question isn't whether He sees you, but whether you're willing to see Him. What you're doing - genuinely seeking, admitting uncertainty, asking for guidance - that's the beginning of real spiritual life.\"\n\n\n\"Not mystical visions?\"\n\n\n\"Mystical visions are rare and not always reliable. But a king who genuinely tries to serve God while navigating the messy realities of power? That's something. That's enough.\"\n\n\n\nJuly 25, 1430 - Day of Rest and Preparation\n\n\nYou spend the day in prayer, contemplation, and practical preparation. The sword lies before you in the monastery chapel as you pray. The inscription catches the candlelight: Non Nobis Domine.\n\n\nTomorrow, you will present yourself at the Vatican. You will seek audience with Pope Martin V. And you will bring your father's sword, seeking blessing and tasking.\n\n\nYour Majesty, are you ready to proceed to the papal audience? Or is there anything else you wish to do or discuss before taking this crucial step?"

This is the combination approach that was discussed. Let me set up the scene for July 26, 1430, when they present themselves at the Vatican.\n\nThis is a significant moment. I should:\n1. Describe the Vatican and the experience of approaching it\n2. Show the dual approach - official petition and private letter to Cardinal Orsini\n3. Indicate the response and timeline for audience\n4. Build appropriate tension and atmosphere\n\nSince this is a reasonable approach with good letters of recommendation, and Cardinal Orsini has been prepared by Cardinal de Foix, I should show positive reception but not immediate audience - papal bureaucracy would still require some process.\n\nLet me create a rich, immersive scene of approaching the Vatican in 1430, the interactions with papal officials, and the outcome of their petition.\n\n\nJuly 26, 1430 - The Vatican\n\n\nMorning Preparation\n\n\nYou wake before dawn in the monastery. Today, you will present yourself to the papal curia and seek audience with the Vicar of Christ.\n\n\nFray Hernando helps you prepare, ensuring your appearance is appropriate - clean, dignified, but not ostentatious. You wear good traveling clothes, not royal regalia. Your father's sword hangs at your side.\n\n\n\"Remember, Your Majesty,\" the monk counsels as you break your fast, \"humility and honesty. You are a pilgrim-king seeking guidance, not a monarch demanding audience.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán has the letters organized:\n\n\nArchbishop of Santiago's letter (opened, for official presentation)\n\nArchbishop of Toulouse's letter (opened)\n\nCardinal de Foix's formal letter from Avignon (opened)\n\nCardinal de Foix's private letter to Cardinal Orsini (sealed)\n\n\nYour party assembles: yourself, Captain Fernán, Fray Hernando, and Sergeant García (as escort). The others remain at the monastery.\n\n\nCrossing the Tiber\n\n\nThe walk from Trastevere to the Vatican takes you across the ancient Ponte Sant'Angelo, the bridge leading to the papal fortress-palace. Early morning light catches the Tiber's waters. Rome is waking - merchants opening shops, pilgrims already moving toward churches, the sounds of a city that has stood for over a thousand years.\n\n\nAs you cross the bridge, you see Castel Sant'Angelo rising on the right - the massive circular fortress that guards the Vatican approaches. Armed guards are visible on its walls.\n\n\n\"The fortress,\" Captain Fernán murmurs. \"The popes can retreat there if Rome becomes dangerous. During the sack of 1084, it saved Pope Gregory VII's life.\"\n\n\nThe weight of history is palpable.\n\n\nApproaching the Vatican\n\n\nThe Vatican complex sprawls before you on its hill across the river. At its heart rises the great Basilica of Saint Peter - though not the magnificent Renaissance structure that will be built in future centuries. This is the ancient Constantinian basilica, over a thousand years old, showing its age but still magnificent.\n\n\nTo the left of the basilica stands the papal palace - a complex of connected buildings that has grown over centuries. This is where Pope Martin V resides, where the papal curia conducts the business of the Church.\n\n\nYour party approaches the main entrance to the papal palace. Guards in papal livery - the crossed keys emblazoned on their surcoats - stand at attention. They're professional, alert, accustomed to receiving pilgrims, petitioners, and dignitaries from across Christendom.\n\n\nThe First Gate\n\n\nThe senior guard, a weathered man in his forties, steps forward as you approach.\n\n\n\"Good morning, pilgrims. State your business with the Holy See.\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán speaks first, formal and respectful: \"We bring a noble pilgrim seeking audience with His Holiness Pope Martin V. We carry letters of recommendation from Santiago de Compostela, Toulouse, and Avignon.\"\n\n\nThe guard's eyes sharpen at \"Avignon.\" That name still carries weight.\n\n\n\"Your identity?\"\n\n\nYou step forward. \"I am Juan, King of Castile and León. I come as pilgrim and petitioner, seeking the Holy Father's wisdom and blessing.\"\n\n\nThe guard's posture immediately shifts - a king is not a common visitor. He bows. \"Your Majesty. Please, wait here a moment while I inform the chamberlain.\"\n\n\nHe disappears into the palace. You wait in the courtyard, feeling the eyes of other guards upon you. Fray Hernando whispers a prayer. Captain Fernán stands alert, hand near his sword out of habit.\n\n\nAfter perhaps ten minutes, the guard returns with an older man in clerical robes - black cassock, red trim indicating curial rank. He's perhaps sixty, with sharp eyes and the air of someone who has managed papal bureaucracy for decades.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he bows with practiced courtesy. \"I am Monsignor Paolo Caraffa, Chamberlain of the Apostolic Palace. We are honored by your presence. Please, come inside.\"\n\n\nInside the Apostolic Palace\n\n\nYou're led through corridors of stone and marble. The palace is a maze of rooms, chapels, offices, and halls. Clerics and officials move purposefully through the corridors. You catch glimpses of frescoed walls, glimpses into chapels where priests say Mass, the sounds of chanted offices echoing from unseen chambers.\n\n\nMonsignor Caraffa leads you to a well-appointed reception room. Tapestries depicting biblical scenes hang on the walls. A crucifix dominates one wall. Chairs and benches provide seating.\n\n\n\"Please, Your Majesty, be comfortable. May I examine your letters of introduction?\"\n\n\nYou hand over the three opened letters - Santiago, Toulouse, Avignon. He reads each carefully, his eyebrows rising slightly as he progresses.\n\n\n\"Most impressive credentials, Your Majesty. Archbishop Don Lope speaks highly of your pilgrimage. Archbishop du Rosier of Toulouse notes your theological discussions. And Cardinal de Foix...\" He looks up. \"The Vice-Legate of Avignon writes with considerable enthusiasm about your faith and character.\"\n\n\n\"I am grateful for their kindness.\"\n\n\n\"And you seek audience with His Holiness regarding...?\"\n\n\nThe Official Petition\n\n\nYou've prepared for this moment. \"Monsignor, I come with both practical and spiritual matters. I seek the Holy Father's blessing on my rule in Castile, his guidance on matters of governance and faith, and...\" you pause, then continue, \"I wish to discuss the possibility of completing the Reconquista in Iberia - bringing the Kingdom of Granada into Christendom.\"\n\n\nMonsignor Caraffa's expression doesn't change, but you sense heightened interest. \"A crusade bull, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\n\"I seek the Holy Father's wisdom on whether such a course is appropriate and feasible. I don't presume to demand anything - I come seeking guidance.\"\n\n\nThe monsignor nods slowly. \"Your Majesty's humility is noted and appreciated. The Holy Father receives many petitions for crusade bulls. He considers each carefully, weighing spiritual, political, and practical dimensions.\"\n\n\nHe sets the letters aside. \"I will present your petition to His Holiness's secretariat. Understanding that the Holy Father's schedule is complex - he manages the entire Church's affairs - I cannot promise immediate audience. But given your credentials and the respect these churchmen show you, I believe audience can be arranged.\"\n\n\n\"How long might that take?\"\n\n\n\"Days, certainly. Possibly a week or two. The Holy Father is elderly and cannot grant lengthy audiences to everyone who requests them. But you are a reigning Catholic monarch with excellent recommendations. You will be seen.\"\n\n\nThe Private Channel\n\n\nYou exchange glances with Fray Hernando. Time for the second approach.\n\n\n\"Monsignor, I also carry a private letter from Cardinal de Foix to Cardinal Giordano Orsini. The Cardinal of Avignon suggested this letter might... facilitate matters.\"\n\n\nMonsignor Caraffa's eyes gleam with understanding. He's a papal bureaucrat - he knows how things actually work.\n\n\n\"Ah. Cardinal Orsini is the Holy Father's most trusted advisor. If Cardinal de Foix has written to him on your behalf, that is... significant.\" He extends his hand. \"May I deliver that letter personally? Cardinal Orsini should be informed of Your Majesty's presence immediately.\"\n\n\nYou hand over the sealed letter. The monsignor examines the seal - genuine, from Avignon - and tucks it carefully into his robes.\n\n\n\"I will deliver this to Cardinal Orsini within the hour. He may wish to meet with Your Majesty before the formal papal audience. That would be... normal, for someone of your importance.\"\n\n\nTranslation: Cardinal Orsini will want to assess you privately before bringing you before the Pope.\n\n\nPractical Arrangements\n\n\n\"In the meantime, Your Majesty, you are lodged at...?\"\n\n\n\"The Monastery of Santa Maria in Trastevere.\"\n\n\n\"Excellent. Brother Benedetto runs a respectable establishment. I will send word there when we have news of audience timing. It may be today, it may be tomorrow, it may be several days. Patience is required when dealing with the Apostolic See.\"\n\n\nHe stands, and you rise as well. \"Your Majesty, one more matter. When audience is granted, you may bring two companions. I presume your chaplain,\" he nods at Fray Hernando, \"and perhaps your captain?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, that would be appropriate.\"\n\n\n\"Very good. The audience will likely be semi-private - His Holiness, perhaps Cardinal Orsini, and a secretary for records. Unless His Holiness decides to make it a formal audience, in which case more of the curia might attend. But for initial meeting, semi-private is customary.\"\n\n\nHe escorts you back toward the entrance. \"Your Majesty, may I speak frankly?\"\n\n\n\"Please.\"\n\n\n\"You come at an interesting time. His Holiness is seventy-two, in declining health though still sharp of mind. There is... awareness that his pontificate may not extend many more years. This colors everything in Rome. Cardinals position themselves. Factions form. When you enter the Vatican's inner chambers, you enter not just a holy place but a political arena.\"\n\n\n\"Cardinal de Foix warned me of this.\"\n\n\n\"Then you come prepared. Good. One more thing: His Holiness responds well to genuine faith. Many petitioners speak piously while thinking politically. If you genuinely seek spiritual guidance as well as political support, let that sincerity show. Pope Martin has spent fifty years in the Church. He knows the difference between performance and truth.\"\n\n\nThe Return to the Monastery\n\n\nYour party walks back across the Ponte Sant'Angelo toward Trastevere. The morning is well advanced now - Rome is fully awake, bustling with activity.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán speaks first: \"Well, that went as well as could be hoped. Official petition filed, private letter delivered to Cardinal Orsini, monsignor seemed impressed by our letters.\"\n\n\n\"Now we wait,\" you say.\n\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"But not idly. We pray, we prepare for the audience whenever it comes, and we stay ready.\"\n\n\nBack at the monastery, you settle into a strange limbo. You're in Rome, your goal within reach, but dependent on papal schedule and bureaucratic processes you cannot control.\n\n\nThat Afternoon - The Summons\n\n\nYou're in the monastery chapel, praying before the altar, when Brother Benedetto hurries in.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty! A messenger from the Vatican!\"\n\n\nA young clerk in curial robes waits in the monastery's receiving room. He bows deeply when you enter.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I bring word from Cardinal Giordano Orsini. His Eminence requests the honor of meeting with you privately tomorrow - July 27th - at the tenth hour (mid-morning). He wishes to discuss your petition and prepare you for audience with His Holiness.\"\n\n\n\"Tell His Eminence I am grateful and will attend at the appointed time.\"\n\n\nThe clerk bows again. \"His Eminence also asked me to convey that he was moved by Cardinal de Foix's letter and looks forward to meeting the young king whose faith and character impressed the Vice-Legate of Avignon so profoundly.\"\n\n\nAfter the messenger leaves, Captain Fernán grins. \"One day. We're in Rome one day and already meeting with the Pope's closest advisor. Your letters worked, Majesty.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando is more measured. \"Meeting Cardinal Orsini is crucial. He'll assess whether to bring you before the Pope, and he'll shape how you're presented. This is where your sincerity must shine through. If he thinks you're just another ambitious young king using piety as cover, he might quietly discourage your petition.\"\n\n\n\"And if he believes I'm genuine?\"\n\n\n\"Then he becomes your advocate. And Cardinal Orsini's advocacy means everything.\"\n\n\nEvening Preparation\n\n\nThat evening, the three of you prepare for tomorrow's meeting with Cardinal Orsini. Fray Hernando coaches you on appropriate forms of address, on how to read a cardinal's responses, on the balance between deference and dignity.\n\n\nYou practice explaining your situation - the political realities, the spiritual seeking, the question about your father's sword.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán interjects occasionally with practical concerns: \"Make sure he understands you can actually win. Popes don't grant crusade bulls for symbolic gestures. They want victories.\"\n\n\nAs night falls, you're alone in your room with your father's sword. You draw the blade, read the inscription again: Non Nobis Domine.\n\n\nTomorrow, you meet the man who advises the Pope. The man who will decide if you're worthy of being brought before the Vicar of Christ.\n\n\nEverything you've worked for, everything you've traveled for, comes down to the next few days.\n\n\n\nStatus - Evening of July 26, 1430\n\n\nAccomplished Today:\n\n\nSuccessfully presented yourself at the Vatican\n\nOfficial petition filed with papal chamberlain\n\nPrivate letter delivered to Cardinal Orsini\n\nStrong impression made with your letters of recommendation\n\nMeeting secured with Cardinal Orsini for tomorrow morning\n\n\nCurrent Position:\n\n\nLodged comfortably at Santa Maria in Trastevere\n\nParty in good health and spirits\n\nResources adequate (approximately 7,200 maravedís remaining)\n\nTimeline sufficient (early to mid-August target for papal audience, plenty of time before must leave for Seville)\n\n\nTomorrow - July 27:\nPrivate meeting with Cardinal Giordano Orsini, the Pope's closest advisor, at the Vatican\n\n\nThe Stakes:\nThis meeting with Cardinal Orsini will likely determine whether you receive papal audience and how you're presented to Pope Martin V. The cardinal will assess your sincerity, your capability, and whether supporting you serves the Church's interests.\n\n\n\nYour Majesty, you have successfully initiated the process. Tomorrow comes the crucial meeting with Cardinal Orsini.\n\n\nIs there anything you wish to do this evening in preparation? Any specific approach you want to take with the Cardinal tomorrow? Or shall we proceed to the meeting?"

The same guards from yesterday recognize you and wave you through with bows.\n\n\nMonsignor Caraffa himself meets you in the courtyard. \"Your Majesty, Cardinal Orsini awaits you in his private study. If you'll follow me?\"\n\n\nHe leads you deeper into the palace than yesterday - up a broad staircase, through more corridors, past a magnificent library where monks work at manuscripts.\n\n\nYou stop before an ornate door. Monsignor Caraffa knocks, then opens it.\n\n\n\"Your Eminence, His Majesty Juan of Castile.\"\n\n\nThe room beyond is a scholar's study - books everywhere, manuscripts on tables, a crucifix on the wall. Seated behind a large desk is Cardinal Giordano Orsini.\n\n\nHe's perhaps sixty-five, wearing simple cardinal's robes. His face is lined but intelligent, his eyes sharp and assessing. He rises as you enter.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says in accented but fluent Castilian. \"Welcome to Rome. Please, sit.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to chairs arranged near his desk. As you and your companions settle, the Cardinal studies you with obvious interest.\n\n\n\"So,\" he says with a slight smile, \"Cardinal de Foix writes that you are 'a remarkable young king worth the Holy Father's attention.' That's high praise from Pierre. He's not easily impressed.\"\n\n\nHe leans back in his chair. \"Tell me, Your Majesty - why have you come to Rome?\"\n\n\nHow do you respond?"

There are many reasons why i wanted to visit Rome. Some are personal and spiritual, but above all, I am a young king who wants to rule in God's image. I have a vision of how the world should be and sometimes I can catch a glimmer of God's kingdom on earth, if only for a fleeting moment. I started my pilgrimage and went to Santiago where I felt inspired to also visit Rome so I can personally declare my own service and that of my kingdom to the holy Church of Christ. Many have advised me against this move, citing rebellion in my absence and other worldly concerns such as safety, but I have a feeling I cannot grasp nor describe. A certain pull and a strange certainty that this is somehow the right thing to do. For better or for worse, I have decided to always follow this feeling and it now has led me here. Officially I am requesting papal support for my reconquista. It will unite my kingdom and solidify my own rule. Important matters of state for sure, but in my heart, I hope that the pope may help me understand my own prayers. Am I just a fool? Am I imagining things? Or am I right to follow my instinct, strange or dangerour they may sometimes appear to be?

They want me to evaluate how likely this specific speech/approach is to gain them an audience with the Pope and Orsini's endorsement.\n\nLet me think about this carefully:\n\n**What Juan is proposing to say:**\n1. Personal and spiritual reasons for coming\n2. Wants to rule in God's image\n3. Has visions of \"God's kingdom on earth\" - glimpses of how things should be\n4. Felt inspired/called to come to Rome\n5. Admits many advised against it (rebellion risk, safety concerns)\n6. Describes a \"feeling\" or \"pull\" - certainty this is right\n7. Has decided to always follow this feeling\n8. Officially requesting crusade support (acknowledges worldly benefits)\n9. But more importantly: wants Pope to help him understand his own prayers\n10. Asks: \"Am I a fool? Am I imagining things? Or am I right to follow my instinct?\"\n11. Seeking spiritual discernment that \"cannot be bought\"\n\n**Assessment factors:**\n\nPOSITIVE:\n- Radical honesty about mixed motives\n- Genuine spiritual seeking (not just political maneuvering)\n- Humility - admits he might be a fool\n- Shows he took risks to come (defied advisors)\n- Asks for help rather than demanding validation\n- The approach is unusual and memorable\n- Shows vulnerability and trust\n- Cardinal Orsini has lived through schisms and politics - genuine faith likely appeals to him\n- Age 18 - some allowance for youth and spiritual uncertainty\n- Good letters of recommendation establish credibility\n\nNEGATIVE/RISKY:\n- Describing \"visions\" and \"feelings\" could sound unstable\n- \"Always following this feeling\" - concerning to a rational churchman\n- Admitting advisors warned against it - might seem reckless\n- Asking if he's a \"fool\" - shows uncertainty that might worry them about entrusting crusade\n\n\n- Very vulnerable/exposed - could be seen as weak or confused\n- The \"feeling\" he describes is vague - not clear spiritual experiences\n- Could sound like mysticism without substance\n- Might worry them he's unstable or too young\n\nI see significant risks in Juan's approach. His vulnerability could be interpreted as weakness, and his vague spiritual experiences might raise suspicions. The church is particularly cautious about mystical claims, especially from a young person. While his honesty is compelling, it also exposes potential instability that could concern sophisticated church leaders like Cardinal Orsini.\n\nThe potential success hinges on Orsini's perception. Juan's previous letters and demonstrated intelligence work in his favor. His radical honesty might actually intrigue Orsini, who likely appreciates genuine spiritual seeking over performative piety. The journey's completion and his political acumen suggest maturity beyond his years.\n\nI assess this as a high-risk strategy with genuine potential. Success depends on Orsini detecting Juan's sincerity beneath the raw emotional disclosure. The approach is bold - revealing vulnerability could either deeply impress or completely undermine Juan's credibility.\n\n\nProbability Assessment: Cardinal Orsini Meeting\n\n\nYour Proposed Approach: Radical honesty about spiritual seeking, admitting you follow \"feelings\" and \"pulls\" you can't fully explain, asking if you're a fool, requesting the Pope's help in understanding your own prayers and discernment.\n\n\n\nMy Assessment: LIKELY TO SUCCEED (but with significant risk)\n\n\nFactors Supporting Success:\n\n\n1. Genuine Sincerity Will Show\nCardinal Orsini has spent decades in the Church and papal politics. He's assessed countless petitioners. Your approach is so vulnerable and honest that it's difficult to fake - he'll likely sense genuine spiritual seeking rather than calculated manipulation.\n\n\n2. Refreshing Honesty About Mixed Motives\nYou openly admit the worldly benefits (unite kingdom, solidify rule) while also revealing deeper spiritual questions. Most petitioners pretend pure motives. Your transparency could be disarming.\n\n\n3. Your Letters Establish Credibility\nSantiago, Toulouse, and especially Avignon have vouched for your intelligence and faith. You're not arriving as unknown quantity - you've been pre-validated by respected churchmen.\n\n\n4. Youth Provides Some Cover\nAt 18, there's allowance for spiritual uncertainty and seeking. An older king claiming to follow mysterious \"feelings\" would seem unstable. A young king genuinely wrestling with discernment seems... human.\n\n\n5. You Took Real Risks\nComing to Rome despite advisors' warnings, defying political prudence - this demonstrates the pull you describe is real to you, not just rhetoric.\n\n\n6. The Question Format\nAsking \"Am I a fool?\" rather than claiming certainty shows humility. You're seeking guidance, not demanding validation.\n\n\nSignificant Risks:\n\n\n1. The \"Feelings\" Language Is Dangerous\nDescribing following a \"pull\" or \"feeling\" you can't grasp could sound like dangerous mysticism. The Church in 1430 is wary of claims of private revelation - heresies often start this way.\n\n\n2. Admission of Uncertainty\nSaying advisors warned against this, asking if you're imagining things - this reveals doubt. Do they want to grant a crusade bull to someone who admits he might be foolish?\n\n\n3. Vagueness of Spiritual Experience\nYou describe \"glimpses\" and \"feelings\" but nothing concrete. Not visions, not voices, not clear guidance - just intuition. This is both more honest and more concerning.\n\n\n4. \"Always Following This Feeling\"\nCommitting to always follow something you can't explain or fully understand - this could worry a rational churchman. What if the \"feeling\" leads you astray?\n\n\n5. Possible Interpretation as Instability\nA less sympathetic listener might conclude: confused young king with delusions of divine guidance, dangerous to empower.\n\n\nWhy \"Likely to Succeed\" Rather Than Higher or Lower:\n\n\nNot \"High Probability\" because: The mystical language and admitted uncertainty create real risk. If Orsini thinks you're unstable or confused, this could end your petition immediately.\n\n\nNot \"Likely to Fail\" because: Your sincerity is likely genuine enough to come through, your credentials are strong, and sophisticated churchmen like Orsini often appreciate radical honesty over performative piety.\n\n\nThe key variables:\n\n\nHow you deliver this (tone, demeanor, body language)\n\nWhether Orsini perceives genuine seeking vs. confusion\n\nHis personal disposition toward mystical language\n\nHow much he trusts Cardinal de Foix's judgment\n\n\nWhat Success Looks Like:\n\n\nIf this works, Orsini will likely:\n\n\nBe moved by your vulnerability and honesty\n\nRecognize genuine spiritual seeking\n\nWant to help guide you\n\nAdvocate strongly for papal audience\n\nPerhaps offer spiritual counsel himself\n\n\nWhat Failure Looks Like:\n\n\nIf this fails, Orsini will likely:\n\n\nBecome concerned about your stability\n\nQuestion whether you're ready for crusade responsibility\n\nGently suggest you're too young/uncertain\n\nDeflect toward more time for spiritual maturity\n\n\nMy Recommendation:\n\n\nThis approach could create genuine connection with Cardinal Orsini IF delivered with the right balance of humility, intelligence, and sincerity. The vulnerability is both your greatest risk and greatest strength.\n\n\nCardinal Orsini is sophisticated enough to appreciate that genuine faith often includes doubt and seeking. But he also needs to believe you're capable of leading a crusade successfully.\n\n\n\nDo you proceed with this approach, Your Majesty? Or do you wish to modify it?"

He says you are a young king genuinely seeking, genuinely uncertain, genuinely struggling with discernment. That is... honest.\"\n\n\nHe leans back in his chair. \"Now, Your Majesty, let us speak practically. You mention the Reconquista, uniting your kingdom, solidifying your rule.

But it is divided while the sultan rules a strongly united kingdom. Taking Grenada requires a constant effort spanning many years and requires enormous resources. This is exactly why Grenada is still holding out, no king has been able to unify the realm long enouth for the ten years it would take. Castille is a devout and pious nation as well. The problem is really uniting everyone under a common banner. If we can do that, we will grind them down like grain beneath a millstone. We have a strategy to take the western forts first and then gradually isolate and starve Grenada itself. The success of this campain would not hinge on a single battle with uncertain outcomes. It will be determined if Castille can muster the will to finally push through and stay united. This is exactly why papal support is crucial, without it I cannot hope to achieve much against Grenada. But I am certain that with the proper support, we will win in the end."

Most of what I hear is my own mind chattering. But sometimes... sometimes there is clarity that feels like it comes from beyond myself. Peace that surpasses understanding. Or profound unease that won't let me rest.\"\n\n\nHis voice grows softer. \"The Church teaches us signs of true divine guidance: it brings humility, not pride. It serves others, not just ourselves. It aligns with Scripture and Church teaching. It brings peace, even when the path is hard. It makes us more charitable, more patient, more like Christ.\"\n\n\nA pause. \"False guidance - whether from the devil or our own ego - does the opposite. It puffs us up. It serves our ambitions while pretending piety. It brings anxiety disguised as certainty. It makes us harsh, judgmental, cruel in God's name.\"\n\n\nYou hear him shift closer to the screen.\n\n\n\"But Your Majesty, here is the hard truth: even with all these guidelines, we can still be wrong. We can mistake our will for God's. Saints have done it. Popes have done it. We are human, and we see through a glass darkly.\"\n\n\nHis voice becomes almost a whisper. \"So what do we do? We do our best to discern. We pray. We seek counsel. We examine our hearts. And then... we act. We choose. And we trust that God, in His mercy, can work even through our mistakes.\"\n\n\n\"That's all any of us can do.\"\n\n\nWhat do you say?"

It's a bit circular, but there's a kind of earnest logic to it.\n\nFray Hernando would be troubled by this reasoning. Juan went from tears and uncertainty to sudden certainty very quickly.

The mention of \"laying his life in God's hands\" which suggests real danger\n4.

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed dramatic papal submission, deemed high probability of success.\n\nThis is a dramatic and bold action. The user wants me to assess the probability of success before describing the Pope's response. Let me think through this carefully.\n\n**The Action:**\nJuan is performing a dramatic act of submission and self-offering:\n- Removing crown, jewelry, clothes (down to loincloth)\n- Laying all possessions before the Pope\n- Offering sword, body, and soul in service\n- Asking if the Pope accepts him as a servant\n\nThis is unprecedented, vulnerable, and theatrical. It's also deeply symbolic in medieval Christian terms - echoing saints who gave up everything, kings who submitted to papal authority, and the ultimate Christian call to lay down one's life.\n\n**Factors Supporting Success:**\n\n1. **Unprecedented Drama**: Popes rarely see this. It's memorable, genuine, and impossible to fake this level of vulnerability.\n\n2. **Medieval Christian Symbolism**: This resonates deeply with Christian ideals of self-emptying (kenosis), submission to God, renunciation of worldly power. The Pope would understand these symbols profoundly.\n\n3. **The Sword Inscription**: \"Non Nobis Domine\" - Not unto us, Lord - perfectly aligns with the action. He's literally enacting the inscription.\n\n4. **Genuine Vulnerability**: An 18-year-old king, essentially naked before the Pope, offering everything. This is not political calculation - it's too risky, too extreme.\n\n5. **It Explains His Earlier Uncertainty**: All his talk of \"feelings\" and \"pulls\" now makes sense - he was building to THIS moment. The Pope would see the throughline.\n\n6. **Papal Authority Affirmed**: By asking \"Do you accept me?\" Juan is giving the Pope ultimate authority to validate (or reject) his calling. Popes appreciate being given power.\n\n7. **Legacy Appeal**: Pope Martin is dying. A young king who literally strips himself bare and offers everything in service to the Church? That's a story that would be told for centuries.\n\n**Factors Creating Risk:**\n\n\nThe performance carries significant potential for misinterpretation. An extreme act of submission might be seen as a sign of mental instability or political manipulation. The Pope could perceive this as a theatrical ploy rather than a genuine spiritual offering. Fray Hernando's visible concern might further complicate the moment, suggesting underlying doubts about Juan's true motivations. The unconventional nature of stripping before the Pope risks being viewed as disrespectful or even mad, potentially undermining Juan's sincere intentions.\n\nMedieval Christian traditions did respect dramatic acts of renunciation, but spontaneous, unscripted displays were considered highly irregular. The Pope, being politically astute and experienced, would likely analyze this gesture through multiple lenses - spiritual, psychological, and strategic. An 18-year-old's vulnerable display before an elderly religious leader creates an inherently uncomfortable dynamic that challenges traditional power structures and expectations.\n\nThe probability of success hinges on the profound symbolic power of complete vulnerability. By offering everything without reservation, the young king taps into deep medieval Christian narratives of submission and spiritual transformation. Yet the extreme nature of the act simultaneously risks being perceived as unhinged or manipulative.\n\nThe assessment ultimately lands on high probability of success, driven by the genuine emotional authenticity and perfect alignment with medieval Christian symbolic language. The potential for transformative impact outweighs the significant risks of misinterpretation.\n\n\nProbability Assessment: The Ultimate Offering\n\n\nYour Proposed Action: Strip yourself of crown, jewelry, and clothing before Pope Martin V, lay all worldly possessions at his feet including your father's sword, and offer yourself - body and soul - as a servant, asking if he accepts you.\n\n\n\nMy Assessment: HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS\n\n\nFactors Strongly Supporting Success:\n\n\n1. Unprecedented Medieval Christian Symbolism\n\n\nThis echoes St. Francis stripping naked before the Bishop of Assisi\n\nRecalls emperors submitting to popes (Henry IV at Canossa)\n\nEnacts the sword's own inscription: \"Non Nobis Domine\" - Not unto us, Lord\n\nMedieval Christianity deeply values renunciation, self-emptying, and submission to Church authority\n\nThis is the language Pope Martin V understands at a profound level\n\n\n2. It Explains Everything That Came Before\n\n\nAll your talk of \"feelings\" and \"uncertainty\" now makes perfect sense\n\nYou were building toward THIS moment\n\nThe Cardinal and Pope will see the throughline: the pull to Rome, retrieving the sword, all leading here\n\nYour genuine confusion about whether it was God's will becomes validated by the action itself\n\n\n3. Genuine Vulnerability Impossible to Fake\n\n\nAn 18-year-old king, essentially naked before the Pope and witnesses\n\nThis is too extreme, too risky to be political calculation\n\nThe physical vulnerability mirrors spiritual vulnerability\n\nYou're literally putting yourself at his mercy\n\n\n4. Affirms Papal Authority Maximally\n\n\nYou're not claiming God spoke to you directly\n\nYou're asking the Vicar of Christ to validate your calling\n\nYou're giving the Pope the power to accept or reject you\n\nThis positions him as the arbiter of God's will - exactly what popes want\n\n\n5. Legacy Appeal to a Dying Pope\n\n\nPope Martin is 72, thinking about what he'll be remembered for\n\nA young king who literally strips himself bare and offers everything in service to the Church?\n\nThat's a story that would echo through Church history for centuries\n\nIt makes Martin V the pope who received such profound submission\n\n\n6. The Practical/Spiritual Balance Resolved\n\n\nYou asked for worldly support (crusade bull) AND spiritual validation\n\nThis action shows you understand the spiritual is primary\n\nBut it also serves the practical goal (makes papal support more likely)\n\nYou've managed to be both genuinely holy AND strategically effective\n\n\n7. Medieval Theater\n\n\nPopes appreciate grand gestures and symbolic acts\n\nThis is memorable, dramatic, unprecedented\n\nIt creates a moment that will be recorded and remembered\n\nThe secretary is literally writing this down for history\n\n\nSignificant Risks:\n\n\n1. Shocking Impropriety\n\n\nStripping before the Pope is extremely unconventional\n\nSome might see it as theatrical madness\n\nIt breaks all normal protocols for papal audience\n\nCould be interpreted as disrespectful\n\n\n2. Questions of Mental Stability\n\n\nA king who does this spontaneously might seem unhinged\n\nCan they trust someone this impulsive with a crusade?\n\nThe Pope might think you're having a breakdown\n\n\n3. Fray Hernando's Visible Concern\n\n\nThe Pope will notice your confessor's troubled expression\n\nThis suggests even your spiritual guide worried about this\n\nCould undermine confidence in your judgment\n\n\n4. Physical Awkwardness\n\n\nAn 18-year-old in a loincloth is... potentially uncomfortable\n\nThe elderly Pope might find this disturbing rather than moving\n\nCaptain Fernán and others present might be horrified\n\n\n5. Too Extreme\n\n\nEven in medieval Christianity, this level of spontaneous renunciation without ritual framework is unusual\n\nYou didn't prepare the Pope for this\n\nHe might feel ambushed or manipulated\n\n\nWhy HIGH PROBABILITY Despite Risks:\n\n\nThe symbolism is TOO perfect for medieval Christianity:\n\n\nSelf-emptying (kenosis) is the core Christian virtue\n\nLaying everything at papal feet affirms Church authority\n\nThe physical act mirrors spiritual submission\n\nIt's exactly what saints and holy kings did\n\n\nPope Martin V's character supports this:\n\n\nHe's sophisticated enough to recognize genuine vulnerability\n\nHe's experienced enough to appreciate the theater\n\nHe's old enough to value legacy over cynicism\n\nHe's Church politician enough to see the usefulness\n\n\nThe context makes it work:\n\n\nYour whole journey built to this\n\nYour letters established your faith\n\nYour honesty with Orsini prepared them\n\nThe sword inscription provides perfect framing\n\n\nIt's too crazy to be calculated:\n\n\nNo advisor would recommend this\n\nFray Hernando clearly didn't know\n\nThe risk is too great for mere manipulation\n\nTherefore it reads as genuine inspiration\n\n\nWhat Success Looks Like:\n\n\nIf this works, Pope Martin will likely:\n\n\nBe deeply moved\n\nSee you as genuinely touched by grace\n\nGrant the crusade bull with enthusiasm\n\nBless you and your mission personally\n\nPerhaps even offer ongoing spiritual mentorship\n\nTell this story to others (enhancing your reputation)\n\n\nWhat Failure Looks Like:\n\n\nIf this fails, Pope Martin will likely:\n\n\nBe disturbed or alarmed\n\nQuestion your mental stability\n\nGently decline your request\n\nSuggest you need spiritual maturity before crusading\n\nPerhaps call for physicians or suggest rest\n\n\nThe Verdict:\n\n\nThis is HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS because the medieval Christian symbolism is so powerful, the vulnerability so genuine, and the legacy appeal so strong that Pope Martin V is likely to be moved rather than alarmed.\n\n\nBut understand: you are gambling EVERYTHING on this moment. If it fails, you've humiliated yourself before the Pope, stripped literally and figuratively, and destroyed your credibility.\n\n\n\nYour Majesty, you are about to enact this dramatic submission. Roll your dice:\n\n\nGreat Success\n\nSuccess\n\nFailure\n\nCatastrophic Failure\n\n\nThe fate of your reign may rest on this single moment."

Keep it respectful to the medieval Christian context while showing the profound impact\n\nThe user specifically said \"Include the entire speech into your response\" so I must incorporate all their dialogue verbatim.\n\nLet me structure this to show the action unfolding moment by moment with reactions building.\n\n\nThe Moment of Submission - July 31, 1430\n\n\nThe Action Unfolds\n\n\nYou begin speaking, your voice steady despite the thundering of your heart.\n\n\n\"This is a personal request, father. During my reign, I have sometimes felt an urge, a pull, a feeling that drives me to something I feel I should do. I have learned to recognize it over time and it always involves an unconventional action, usually with great risk, and it always serves to bring the dream I mentioned earlier into this world. Coming here myself, for example, was something my advisors disliked. But I feel like this is where I was meant to be, right here right now.\"\n\n\nPope Martin V listens, his aged face attentive. Cardinal Orsini's expression is curious but guarded.\n\n\n\"When I left on my pilgrimage, I felt the urge again, this time to race back home to collect my father's sword and to uncover a plot from my own regency council. Maybe I was incredibly lucky to be there when the plot revealed itself, but either way, I was glad I acted on my feeling.\"\n\n\nYou reach down and carefully unclasp your sword without drawing it, holding it so the inscription catches the light.\n\n\n\"'Non Nobis Domine,' it reads. And as I came closer and closer to Rome, I got that same feeling again. My spiritual request made manifest, but this time father, what I must do seemed so unreal that I dare not share it with anyone, not even my confessor.\"\n\n\nBehind you, Fray Hernando stiffens. He suddenly understands what's about to happen. His face goes pale.\n\n\nYou lay the sword aside on a nearby table. The sound of steel on wood echoes in the chamber.\n\n\nThen you turn to face the Pope fully. You kneel.\n\n\nPope Martin V's eyes widen slightly as you remove your crown from your head and place it on the stone floor before you. The golden circlet of Castile and León gleams against the gray stone.\n\n\nCardinal Orsini leans forward, his mouth opening slightly.\n\n\nYou begin removing your rings - one, two, three - each one clicking softly as it joins the crown. Your chain of office. A pendant. All your jewelry accumulates in a small pile.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty—\" Captain Fernán starts behind you, alarm in his voice.\n\n\nBut you continue. Your hands move to your outer garments.\n\n\nYou had prepared for this. The clasps come loose easily. Your fine overtunic slides off your shoulders and joins the crown and jewels on the floor.\n\n\nThe secretary's quill has stopped moving. He stares, frozen.\n\n\nYour shirt follows. The cool air of the chamber touches your bare chest.\n\n\nFray Hernando's hand covers his mouth. His eyes are wide with shock and something else - recognition that this is what you wouldn't tell him in confession.\n\n\nYou stand briefly to remove your boots, your hose, your remaining outer garments. You fold them with deliberate care and place them with the rest.\n\n\nYou stand before the Pope in only your loincloth - an 18-year-old king, stripped of every symbol of royalty, every protection of rank, every shield of dignity.\n\n\nThe chamber is utterly silent except for your breathing and the distant sounds of Rome beyond the windows.\n\n\nPope Martin V has not moved. His aged hands grip the arms of his chair. His eyes - those sharp, political eyes that have seen everything in fifty years of Church service - are fixed on you with an intensity that seems to transcend his physical frailty.\n\n\nYou take the sword from the table. It feels heavier now, more significant. You hold it horizontal across your palms and lay it atop the pile of your worldly possessions - crown, jewels, clothes, weapon, all together.\n\n\nThen you sink to your knees. The stone floor is cold against your bare skin. You spread your arms wide in the ancient posture of supplication - cruciform, vulnerable, utterly exposed.\n\n\nYour voice rings out clearly in the chamber:\n\n\n\"Lord father! Look upon this mortal man who is full of sin but strives to live in your image. I lay everything I have at your feet. These are all my worldly possessions. My wealth, my crown, my clothes, my weapon and also my body and soul. These I offer in your service Lord and this is my spiritual request. My choice to come to Rome personally, my need to go back to fetch my father's sword and now my choice to offer it to you all. It has all led me to this.\"\n\n\nYou raise your eyes to meet the Pope's directly.\n\n\n\"Do you accept me as your servant, o Lord?\"\n\n\nThe Reactions\n\n\nThe Secretary:\nThe young priest has dropped his quill entirely. Ink spreads across his parchment unnoticed. He's staring with his mouth open, clearly witnessing something he never imagined he would see. His hands shake as he fumbles to retrieve his quill.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán:\nThe soldier has gone rigid, his face a mixture of shock, horror, and dawning understanding. His hand has moved instinctively toward his sword - the protective instinct of a guard - but he's frozen, realizing there's no threat to defend against. His eyes are wet. He's witnessing his king in a moment of profound vulnerability, and every military instinct screams that this is dangerous, yet something deeper tells him this is... holy.\n\n\nFray Hernando:\nThe monk has sunk to his own knees, tears streaming down his face. His lips move in silent prayer. All his concern, all his warnings, all his fear - it culminates in this. He sees now what you were trying to protect, what you knew would lose its purity if you spoke it aloud and received counsel. His face shows awe, terror, and profound spiritual recognition. This is what saints do. This is what the holy fools of Christ do. This is kenosis - complete self-emptying.\n\n\nCardinal Orsini:\nThe Cardinal's sophisticated political mask has cracked completely. He stares at you, then at the Pope, then back at you. His mouth works soundlessly. This is beyond politics, beyond strategy, beyond anything he prepared for. His hand makes the sign of the cross unconsciously. He's witnessing something that will be recorded in Church history, and he knows it.\n\n\nPope Martin V:\n\n\nThe elderly pontiff sits utterly still for a long moment that seems to stretch into eternity. His face has gone through shock, then something deeper - recognition, wonder, perhaps even fear of the divine moving through this moment.\n\n\nThen tears begin to fall down his aged cheeks.\n\n\nHis trembling left hand - the one that usually shakes with palsy - has gone completely still. He grips the arm of his chair with surprising strength as he pushes himself to stand.\n\n\nCardinal Orsini moves to help him but the Pope waves him away with unexpected vigor.\n\n\nPope Martin V rises to his full height. Despite his seventy-two years, despite his frailty, he seems suddenly larger, invested with the full weight of his office as Vicar of Christ.\n\n\nHe steps down from his chair and walks - slowly, with dignity - toward you.\n\n\nThe entire chamber holds its breath.\n\n\nThe Pope reaches the pile of your possessions. He looks down at them: the crown of Castile, the sword inscribed Non Nobis Domine, the simple garments of a pilgrim-king.\n\n\nThen he kneels.\n\n\nA gasp escapes from everyone present. The Pope - the Successor of Peter, Christ's Vicar on Earth - is kneeling on the stone floor beside a nearly naked young king.\n\n\nPope Martin V reaches out with both hands and lifts your father's sword. He holds it horizontal, reading the inscription, tears still flowing freely down his weathered face.\n\n\n\"Non Nobis Domine, sed nomini tuo da gloriam,\" he speaks the full verse from Psalm 115 in a voice that seems to grow stronger with each word. \"Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Your name give glory.\"\n\n\nHe turns to you, still kneeling at your level, eye to eye.\n\n\n\"Juan, King of Castile and León,\" his voice resonates with authority and emotion, \"in fifty years of service to Holy Church, We have seen much. Kings who petition for power. Princes who demand recognition. Lords who negotiate for advantage. All of them clothe their ambitions in piety while their hearts remain clothed in pride.\"\n\n\nHis voice breaks slightly. \"Never - never - have We seen this. This complete renunciation. This total offering. This... this is what Christ calls us to. 'Unless you become like children, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.' You have made yourself a child before God, before Us, before all assembled here.\"\n\n\nPope Martin V lifts the sword higher.\n\n\n\"This sword, inscribed by your father with words of humility, you bring to Us not demanding, not claiming divine right, but asking - asking if God will accept your service.\"\n\n\nThe Pope's voice rings out powerfully now, his frailty seemingly forgotten:\n\n\n\"We are Martin, Bishop of Rome, Successor of Peter, Vicar of Christ on Earth. We do not presume to speak for God in all things, for We too are merely His servant. But We are called to discern, to bless, to commission those whom the Spirit moves.\"\n\n\nHe looks directly into your eyes, and you see in his aged face something transcendent - not just the political animal who ended the Schism, but the priest, the shepherd, the guardian of souls.\n\n\n\"And We say to you: YES. We accept you as Christ's servant. We accept your offering. We accept your sword, your crown, your very self in service to the Gospel and to Holy Church.\"\n\n\nHe raises the sword and places the flat of the blade against your right shoulder, then your left - the gesture of knighting, but invested with far greater significance.\n\n\n\"Juan of Castile, We bless you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. We charge you: Go forth and bring the light of Christ to Granada. Unite your kingdom not for your own glory, but for God's. Wield this sword not for conquest, but for conversion. Wear this crown not as privilege, but as burden of service.\"\n\n\nPope Martin V's voice drops to something more intimate, almost gentle:\n\n\n\"You asked if We accept you as servant. Child, you are accepted. You are blessed. You are commissioned. And more - you are loved by the Church you have so profoundly honored today.\"\n\n\nThe Pope slowly stands, using the sword as support. He extends his hand to help you rise as well.\n\n\n\"Come, child. Stand. Clothe yourself again. Take back your crown, your sword, your kingship. But know that you take them back as instruments of divine service, blessed and sanctified by this moment of perfect renunciation.\"\n\n\nHe turns to Cardinal Orsini, his voice returning to its papal authority:\n\n\n\"Cardinal Orsini, let it be recorded: We grant to Juan II of Castile and León a plenary crusade bull for the recovery and conversion of the Kingdom of Granada. Let all Christendom know that this young king has offered himself completely to God's service, and We commission him to complete the Reconquista in Christ's name.\"\n\n\nTo the secretary: \"Let this audience be recorded in full. Every detail. Future ages must know what occurred here this day.\"\n\n\nThe Pope hands you back your father's sword, then reaches down and lifts your crown. He places it back on your head himself - not you taking it back, but the Pope investing you with it anew.\n\n\n\"Non Nobis Domine,\" he says softly. \"Not unto us, Lord. Remember this always, Juan. Remember this moment when the weight of crown and sword grows heavy. You offered them freely. We give them back as sacred trust.\"\n\n\nHe embraces you - Pope Martin V embracing a nearly naked young king - and whispers in your ear so only you can hear:\n\n\n\"God is with you, child. We saw His hand in this moment. Do not doubt what you have done here. This was... this was grace.\"\n\n\nThe Aftermath of the Moment\n\n\nBehind you, Fray Hernando is weeping openly, his shoulders shaking with sobs of relief, awe, and spiritual overwhelm.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán has gone to one knee, his hand over his heart, tears on his scarred soldier's face.\n\n\nCardinal Orsini stands with both hands covering his face, whether in prayer or simply overcome, it's impossible to tell.\n\n\nThe secretary writes furiously, trying to capture everything, his hand trembling so hard the words are barely legible.\n\n\nPope Martin V steps back, still holding your hands, looking at you with an expression of profound tenderness mixed with something like wonder.\n\n\n\"Dress yourself, child,\" he says gently. \"Then We will speak of practical matters - the crusade bull's terms, the resources We can provide, the letters We will write on your behalf. But those are mere details compared to what has happened here.\"\n\n\nHe turns to address the entire chamber, his voice carrying papal authority:\n\n\n\"Let all present bear witness: God has moved in this chamber today. We have seen true faith, true renunciation, true offering of self. This is what it means to be a Christian king. This is what it means to serve Christ through the crown.\"\n\n\nThe Pope returns to his chair, suddenly seeming his seventy-two years again, exhausted by the intensity of the moment. But his eyes remain fixed on you with warmth and blessing.\n\n\n\"Come, Juan of Castile. Clothe yourself and let us speak as father to son, as Peter's successor to Christ's servant king.\"\n\n\n\nYour Majesty, you have achieved something unprecedented. Pope Martin V has not merely granted your request - he has been profoundly moved, has blessed you personally, has commissioned you as a crusader, and has ensured this moment will be recorded for all time.\n\n\nWhat do you do or say now?"

Address the Pope to discuss the terms of the crusade bull\n\nThis is a moment of consolidating the dramatic spiritual gesture. Juan is showing he meant what he did - keeping the renunciation real by giving away the material wealth. But he keeps the sword and crown - the instruments of his service.\n\nI should keep this relatively short and focused on the immediate moment and transition to discussing practical terms with the Pope.\n\n\nDressing and Preparing for Discussion\n\n\nYou rise, still trembling slightly from the intensity of what just occurred. Your clothes feel different as you put them back on - as if they've been transformed by what happened, sanctified by the Pope's blessing.\n\n\nThe shirt, the tunic, the boots - each piece goes on quickly but deliberately. You buckle your father's sword back at your side. The weight of it feels both familiar and entirely new.\n\n\nBut when you reach for your rings and jewelry, you pause. You gather them in your hands - gold, precious stones, symbols of wealth and status - and turn to Captain Fernán.\n\n\nThe soldier is still on one knee, his face wet with tears.

He simply closes his hands around the jewelry and nods, understanding.\n\n\nYou leave your crown on - the Pope himself placed it back on your head. That is different. That is the instrument of service, not decoration.\n\n\nTurning back to Pope Martin V, you see the elderly pontiff watching this exchange with approval in his eyes.\n\n\n\"You truly meant it,\" he says softly. \"The offering was not theater. You strip yourself of what is unnecessary, keep only what serves the work.\" He gestures to the chair across from him. \"Sit, child.

Sole command authority over the crusade\n2. Call for Christian participation with commitment until victory\n3. Military Orders committed to the crusade\n4. Right to levy special crusade tax\n5. Direct Vatican resources\n\nThese are significant requests, some of which are quite radical. Let me think about how Pope Martin V would respond to each:\n\n1. Sole command: This is actually fairly reasonable and has precedent. The Pope would likely agree but with caveats about Church oversight.\n\n2. Commitment until victory: This is problematic - \"until victory\" could mean decades. The Pope would likely soften this.\n\n3. Military Orders: Very tricky. The Orders are semi-autonomous and politically entangled. The Pope can encourage but not command them without causing issues.\n\n4. Crusade tax: Standard for crusade bulls, though the Church usually gets a cut.\n\n5. Vatican resources: The Pope would offer some support but the Vatican's finances in 1430 are not unlimited.\n\nThe Pope has been deeply moved by Juan's offering, but he's still a practical politician. He'd grant much but not everything, and would negotiate carefully. This should be a dialogue, not just a yes/no response.\n\nI should make this feel like a real negotiation between two people who now have genuine spiritual connection but also practical concerns.\n\n\nPope Martin V's Response\n\n\nThe Pope listens carefully, his fingers drumming slowly on the arm of his chair. Cardinal Orsini leans down to whisper something, but Martin waves him quiet.\n\n\n\"Sole command,\" the Pope repeats. \"You understand what you ask? The Military Orders, the great noble houses - many will resist a young king claiming absolute authority over them, even with papal blessing.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, studying you. \"But you are right. Divided command has poisoned every crusade in living memory. The Hussite disasters prove this daily.\"\n\n\nHe nods slowly. \"Very well. The bull will name you Supreme Commander of the Crusade, with full authority to appoint and dismiss subordinate commanders. All who take the cross must swear obedience to you in matters of the crusade. This We can grant.\"\n\n\n\"However,\" he raises a finger, \"the bull will also name a Papal Legate - a cardinal or archbishop - to accompany the crusade.

This is a good response - it shows Juan is genuine about wanting spiritual guidance and isn't just seeking unchecked power.

Call for all Christians to join/support\n2. Military Orders commitment\n3. Special crusade tax\n4. Vatican resources\n\nI should keep this response focused and not too long - just the Pope's reaction to the Legate acceptance and then moving to the next point in the discussion.\n\n\nPope Martin V's Pleased Response\n\n\nThe Pope's face breaks into a genuine smile - the first you've seen from him.\n\n\n\"You welcome the Legate with open arms. Good. That shows wisdom beyond your years.\" He glances at Cardinal Orsini. \"Most kings fight tooth and nail against having Church oversight of their military campaigns. You understand that spiritual discipline serves the crusade's success.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"We will appoint someone shortly. Likely a Spanish bishop who knows your kingdom and can navigate both Church and royal authority. You will have input on the selection if you wish.\"\n\n\nHe settles back. \"Now, your second request: a general call for Christians to join or support, with commitment until victory.\"\n\n\nThe Pope nods. \"Standard crusade language. We will include it. Those who take the cross receive the usual indulgences - remission of temporal punishment for confessed sins, protection of property while on crusade, suspension of debts and legal proceedings. In return, yes, they commit until the campaign concludes or you release them from their vows.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"But Juan, understand - we can write that in the bull, but enforcement is your burden. Men will still desert, nobles will still claim urgent business at home. The bull gives you legal and spiritual authority to punish oath-breakers, but you must actually do it.\"\n\n\n\"I understand, Holy Father.\"\n\n\n\"The Military Orders...\" His expression becomes more complicated. \"Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara.

      "say": "Thought process: Pondered papal influence over medieval Castilian military orders.\n\nThe user is asking what Pope Martin V says about the Military Orders. This is a complex political issue. Let me think about the historical context and what makes sense:\n\n1. The Military Orders in 1430 Castile were:\n- Santiago (largest and wealthiest)\n- Calatrava\n- Alcántara\n- These were semi-independent organizations with their own lands, incomes, and military forces\n- Masters were elected by their members, often influenced by noble factions\n- They owed allegiance to the Pope technically, but were deeply embedded in Castilian politics\n- The Master of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán) was mentioned as allied with the Infantes\n\n2. Pope Martin V's perspective:\n- The Orders are papal institutions technically\n- But he has limited practical control over them in Castile\n- Commanding them to join the crusade is theoretically within papal authority\n- But enforcement is complicated\n- The Orders are wealthy and militarily powerful - their support would be crucial\n- But they're also political actors who might resist\n\n3. What would the Pope realistically say?\n- He can order them to participate\n- But he knows the political reality is messy\n- He might express concern about their current leadership/loyalties\n- He might offer to help but acknowledge limitations\n- He might suggest reforms or changes to leadership\n- He would want to appear authoritative while being realistic\n\nLet me craft a response that's true to the medieval political reality while moving the conversation forward.\n\n\nPope Martin V on the Military Orders\n\n\nThe Pope's expression becomes thoughtful, almost troubled.\n\n\n\"The Military Orders are technically under papal authority. They were founded to fight for the Church, and We can command them to take up the cross for Granada.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, choosing his words carefully.\n\n\n\"But you know as well as We do that the reality is more complicated. The Masters are chosen by political influence, not spiritual merit. They have vast estates, their own armies, their own treasuries. They have become... kingdoms within your kingdom.\"\n\n\nCardinal Orsini speaks up: \"Your Majesty, the Master of Santiago - Luis de Guzmán - is he not allied with the Infantes de Aragón?\"\n\n\nYou nod. The Pope makes a small sound of understanding.\n\n\n\"There is the problem,\" Martin says. \"We can write in the bull that Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara must commit their forces to your crusade under your command. We can threaten excommunication for refusal. But if the Master of Santiago uses the crusade as opportunity to undermine you...\"\n\n\nHe spreads his aged hands. \"The bull gives you authority. But authority on parchment must become authority in practice. That is your work, not Ours.\"\n\n\nThe Pope leans forward. \"However, We can do this: The bull will explicitly state that the Orders serve under your supreme command, that their Masters have no independent authority during the crusade. If they disobey, they disobey a papal directive. That gives you leverage.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"And if you find the current Masters... unsuitable for this holy work, We might be persuaded to investigate their fitness for office. Masters can be removed by papal authority if they prove unworthy.\"\n\n\nA subtle offer of political support.\n\n\nHow do you respond?"

You wish to levy special taxation to fund the campaign.\"\n\n\nCardinal Orsini clears his throat. \"Your Holiness, this is standard for crusade bulls. A portion of Church revenues can be redirected, indulgences can be sold, special tithes authorized.\"\n\n\n\"We know what is standard, Cardinal,\" the Pope says mildly. He looks at you. \"Yes, the bull will authorize special taxation. Church properties in Castile will contribute - say, one-tenth of their annual revenues for the duration of the crusade. We will also authorize the sale of indulgences to fund the campaign.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"But Juan, be careful with this power. Heavy taxation breeds resentment. The nobles will resist. Even the Church will grumble if pushed too hard. Use this authority wisely, not rapaciously.\"\n\n\n\"I understand, Holy Father.\"\n\n\n\"Good.\" The Pope takes a slow breath. \"Now, you asked what resources the Vatican itself will commit.\"\n\n\nHe exchanges a long look with Cardinal Orsini before answering.\n\n\n\"The papal treasury is... not what it once was. Decades of schism, rebuilding Roman authority, the Hussite crusades draining funds...\" He spreads his hands. \"We cannot send you armies or vast sums of gold.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"But We can offer this: Twenty thousand florins from the papal treasury as seed money for your crusade. Letters to every Catholic monarch endorsing your campaign and requesting their support. Diplomatic pressure on Aragon - We will write to King Alfonso, making clear the Church expects him to support, not hinder, your crusade.\"\n\n\nThe Pope's voice strengthens. \"And this, which may be most valuable: We will send you sacred relics for your campaign standard. A fragment of the True Cross. A bone of Saint James himself from Compostela. When your army marches, it marches under the most holy symbols of Christendom.\"\n\n\nHe watches your reaction. \"Are these resources sufficient, or do you require more from Us?\"\n\n\nHow do you respond?"

Juan is in confession but can't think of specific sins to confess. He's been so focused on the papal meeting that it occupied all his thoughts. He mentions there's a \"hole in his heart\" from the incomplete previous confession, and he's now searching for pride and hubris.\n\nThis is a genuine spiritual moment - he's looking for spiritual guidance on how to guard his soul after such an extraordinary event. He's concerned about pride even in the midst of what seems to be a genuine act of grace.\n\nFray Hernando would respond pastorally here, helping him examine his conscience but also providing spiritual counsel about how to move forward after such an intense spiritual experience.\n\n\nFray Hernando's Gentle Guidance\n\n\nThere's a long, thoughtful silence from the other side of the screen.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Fray Hernando finally says, his voice warm, \"you search your soul for pride and hubris, which itself shows humility. But I think perhaps what you're feeling isn't guilt over sin, but spiritual exhaustion after profound experience.\"\n\n\nHe shifts slightly. \"You offered everything today. Stripped yourself bare - literally and spiritually. That leaves the soul... tender. Raw. Like a wound that has been cleaned but still aches.\"\n\n\nA pause. \"As for guarding your soul going forward - that is wise to ask. Because yes, pride can creep in even after holy moments. Perhaps especially after such moments.\"\n\n\nHis voice becomes more direct. \"Here is what I counsel: Remember always that the Pope's blessing was not for YOU alone, but for the work you pledged to do. You are an instrument. The moment you begin to think 'I am special, I am chosen, God speaks to me' - that is when pride enters.\"\n\n\nHe continues: \"The crusade bull, the blessing, the resources - these are not rewards for your holiness. They are tools for service. And service is hard, unglamorous work that will test you daily.\"\n\n\nA gentle pause. \"Is there anything specific troubling your conscience, my son? Or do you seek absolution more for the general human condition of sinfulness than for particular acts?\"\n\n\nHow do you respond?"

Every evening, ask yourself: 'Did I act for God's glory or my own today? Did I use my authority to serve or to aggrandize myself?'\n\n\nSecond: Never refuse counsel. When advisors warn you, when I challenge you, when even common soldiers question - listen. The moment you stop listening is the moment pride has won.\n\n\nThird: Return to that moment in the papal chamber. Not to glory in it, but to remember your vulnerability. You knelt naked and afraid. When you feel yourself growing proud, remember that fear. Remember that you are still that young man who didn't know if he was fool or faithful.\n\n\nFourth: I am your confessor. Use me.

Force yourself to speak it aloud in confession, and it will lose its power.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Can you commit to these practices?\"\n\n\nDo you commit?"

If they leave Rome by August 5-7, do the Italian city visits (2 weeks), sail to Barcelona (2 weeks), that puts them in Barcelona by early September. Then Barcelona to Seville (2-3 weeks) would get them there by late September/early October.\n\nSo yes, there's time, but it's getting tighter.

Florence is six to seven days north by horse. Pisa another two days west from there. That's nine days of riding plus time in each city.\"\n\n\nHe continues: \"Say three days in Florence, two in Pisa - that's two weeks total for the Italian portion. Then we need a ship from Pisa to Barcelona... that's sailing west across the Mediterranean, perhaps five hundred miles. Could be ten days to two weeks if wind cooperates, longer if it doesn't.\"\n\n\n\"Time in Barcelona?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"If you're visiting, at least three or four days to make it worthwhile. Then Barcelona to Seville by sea is another six hundred miles, two to three weeks.\"\n\n\nHe tallies it up. \"Best case: six weeks total from leaving Rome to reaching Seville. That puts us there in mid to late September. The council is November eighth, so yes, there's time.\"\n\n\nHe looks up. \"But Your Majesty, that's best case.

The Mediterranean in late summer can be unpredictable. But I think the Captain's timeline is sound if we move efficiently.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"However, there's another consideration: Florence and Pisa are rivals. They're often at odds. Visiting both requires... delicate diplomacy. You can't show favor to one without offending the other.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Barcelona, though - that's the real prize, isn't it? It's King Alfonso's city, your Infantes' brother's seat of power. Arriving there with the Pope's crusade bull, showing yourself as blessed crusader...\" He grins. \"That sends a message to the Infantes that they can't ignore.\"\n\n\nWhat does Fray Hernando think?\n\n\nThe monk has been quiet, listening.

I should keep it relatively short as instructed.\n\n\nPrayer in Silence\n\n\nYour mind fills with images: Castile united under the white banner. Granada's towers flying the cross. Nobles bending knee not to you but to the cause. The Infantes brought to heel - not destroyed, but aligned.\n\n\nYou see yourself in the stained white tabard Fray Hernando approved. Mud from sieges, blood from battles, dust from the long campaigns. Each stain a step toward the kingdom of God made manifest.\n\n\nThen your thoughts turn darker. Pride. The whispers will come: \"The blessed king.\" \"The Pope's chosen.\" \"God's instrument.\" How easy it would be to believe them. To think yesterday's moment proved you special rather than simply obedient.\n\n\nYou think of Fray Hernando's warnings. Of the Inquisitors who tortured in God's name. Of crusaders who massacred and called it holy.\n\n\nLord, keep me humble. Let the stains on my white remind me I am not pure. Let every praise be followed by examination of conscience. Let success not become pride.\n\n\nYou kneel there, thinking, planning, praying - the mixture that has always defined you.\n\n\nBeside you, Pope Martin V breathes slowly, deeply. His elderly frame is still, his prayer seemingly more contemplative than yours.\n\n\nAfter perhaps fifteen minutes, the Pope stirs. \"Come, child. Let Us celebrate the Mass.\"\n\n\nHe rises with difficulty. You and Fray Hernando help him to his feet. The Pope moves to the altar and begins vesting himself in the full Mass vestments.\n\n\n\"Will you serve, Juan?\" he asks. \"Act as Our altar server?\"\n\n\nDo you accept?"

Such a moment has been granted to Us, and through Us, to all Christendom.\n\nOur beloved son Juan, King of Castile and León, having completed pilgrimage to the shrine of Blessed James at Compostela, did present himself before Us in Our city of Rome with such profound demonstration of faith and humility as We have rarely witnessed in Our long service to Holy Church. \n\nIn Our presence, this young king did strip himself of crown, wealth, and worldly garments, offering his very person and kingdom to God's service through the ministry of the Apostolic See. By this act of complete renunciation and offering, he has shown himself worthy to be called a true soldier of Christ and a faithful son of the Church.\n\nMoved by the Holy Spirit and recognizing the sincere faith of this Our son, and considering the great work yet undone in the Iberian lands where the Crescent still holds sway over territories that rightfully belong to the Cross, We have determined to grant those favors and authorities herein described.\n\n---\n\n## Article I: Proclamation of Crusade\n\n**BY THE AUTHORITY OF ALMIGHTY GOD**, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by Our own authority as Vicar of Christ on Earth, **WE DO HEREBY PROCLAIM AND DECREE**:\n\nA plenary and universal **CRUSADE** against the Moorish Kingdom of Granada, for the recovery of Christian lands unjustly held, for the liberation of souls dwelling in the darkness of false belief, and for the completion of that sacred Reconquista begun by the faithful kings of Spain in ages past.\n\nThis Crusade is declared to be a work of supreme spiritual merit, undertaken not for earthly gain but for the greater glory of God and the salvation of souls. All who participate with pure hearts shall be accounted among the blessed warriors of Christ.\n\n---\n\n## Article II: Supreme Command\n\n**WE DO APPOINT AND COMMISSION** Our beloved son Juan, King of Castile and León, as **SUPREME COMMANDER** of this Holy Crusade, with full, complete, and exclusive authority over all military operations, strategic decisions, and temporal governance of crusading forces.\n\n**This authority includes, without limitation:**\n\n1. **Command of All Forces**: All Christian forces engaged in this Crusade, whether royal armies, feudal levies, forces of the Military Orders, foreign knights, or any other armed Christians, shall be under the sole command of King Juan. No lord, prince, master, or commander may refuse his lawful orders or pursue independent military action.\n\n2. **Appointment and Dismissal**: The Supreme Commander may appoint subordinate commanders, captains, and officers as he deems necessary for the prosecution of the Crusade, and may dismiss any such officers for cause. He may reorganize military structures as required for effective command.\n\n3. **Strategic Authority**: All decisions regarding campaigns, sieges, battles, truces, terms of surrender, and military strategy rest solely with the Supreme Commander. No council, assembly, or individual may override his military judgment.\n\n4. **Discipline and Justice**: The Supreme Commander has authority to maintain military discipline, to judge military offenses, and to punish violations of crusading vows or military orders according to canon law and the laws of war.\n\n**Any Christian who refuses the lawful commands** of the Supreme Commander in matters pertaining to this Crusade, or who pursues independent military action contrary to his orders, shall be subject to ecclesiastical censure including possible excommunication, and shall forfeit all crusading indulgences and privileges.\n\n---\n\n## Article III: The Military Orders\n\nThe venerable **Military Orders of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara**, founded for the defense of Christendom and the prosecution of holy war against the enemies of Christ, are hereby commanded and required to commit their full strength to this Crusade.\n\n**WE DO DECREE:**\n\n1. The Masters of these Orders shall place their forces under the Supreme Command of King Juan for the duration of this Crusade.\n\n2. The Orders shall provide knights, men-at-arms, supplies, and financial support as determined necessary by the Supreme Commander.\n\n3. The Orders retain their internal discipline and religious observances, but in all military matters they serve as integral components of the crusading army under unified command.\n\n4. Should any Master prove unworthy, disobedient, or unsuited to this holy work, We reserve the right to investigate and, if necessary, remove said Master and appoint a successor more fitting for the prosecution of God's work.\n\nThe Military Orders are reminded that their original purpose was precisely this: to fight for the Cross against the Crescent. This Crusade returns them to their sacred founding mission.\n\n---\n\n## Article IV: Call to Christendom\n\n**WE DO CALL UPON** all faithful Christians, noble and common, clergy and laity, to support this holy endeavor according to their abilities:\n\n**To Knights and Men-at-Arms**: Take up the cross and join this sacred campaign. Your swords are needed for Christ's work.\n\n**To Lords and Nobles**: Provide men, supplies, and financial support. Lead your retinues in holy service.\n\n**To Merchants and Craftsmen**: Support the Crusade with your skills and resources. Just profit from supplying Christ's army carries no shame.\n\n**To Clergy**: Preach this Crusade, encourage the faithful, pray for victory, and accompany the armies as chaplains.\n\n**To All the Faithful**: Even those who cannot take the cross personally may support through prayer, alms, and financial contributions.\n\n**Those who take the crusading vow commit themselves** until the Kingdom of Granada is conquered and converted, or until the Supreme Commander releases them from their vows. This is not a seasonal campaign but a sustained effort that may require years of service.\n\n---\n\n## Article V: Indulgences and Privileges\n\n**TO ALL WHO TAKE THE CROSS** in this holy Crusade, We grant the following spiritual benefits and temporal protections:\n\n### Spiritual Benefits:\n\n1. **Plenary Indulgence**: Full remission of temporal punishment due for all sins properly confessed with sincere contrition. This indulgence applies both to those who serve personally in the crusading army and to those who support the Crusade financially according to their means.\n\n2. **Remission of Penances**: All ecclesiastical penances imposed for past sins are remitted for those who serve faithfully in this Crusade.\n\n3. **Special Intercession**: Daily prayers shall be offered in churches throughout Christendom for the success of this Crusade and for the souls of crusaders living and dead.\n\n4. **Martyrdom**: Those who die in the service of this Crusade, having confessed their sins and received the sacraments, shall be accounted as martyrs for the faith, and We have every confidence that God shall receive their souls with mercy.\n\n### Temporal Protections:\n\n1. **Protection of Property**: All property, lands, and goods of crusaders are placed under the protection of Holy Church for the duration of their service. Any who unjustly seize crusader property during their absence shall be excommunicated.\n\n2. **Suspension of Debts**: Interest on debts owed by crusaders shall not accrue during their service. Creditors may not foreclose on crusader property during their absence.\n\n3. **Legal Immunity**: Legal proceedings against crusaders are suspended for the duration of their service, save for the most serious crimes against God and man.\n\n4. **Safe Conduct**: Crusaders traveling to and from the campaign are granted safe conduct through all Christian lands. Those who harm or impede crusaders in their travels shall face ecclesiastical censure.\n\n---\n\n## Article VI: Crusade Taxation\n\nTo provide the necessary resources for this sacred undertaking, **WE DO AUTHORIZE** the following taxation:\n\n1. **Church Revenues**: All ecclesiastical properties, monasteries, bishoprics, and church foundations within the Kingdom of Castile shall contribute one-tenth of their annual revenues to the Crusade for its duration.\n\n2. **Sale of Indulgences**: Indulgences may be purchased by those unable to serve personally, with all proceeds directed to the Crusade treasury. These indulgences shall be sold at fair rates determined by the Papal Legate in consultation with the Supreme Commander.\n\n3. **Special Tithes**: The Supreme Commander may, with the approval of the Papal Legate, levy additional tithes on the realm as necessary to sustain the campaign, provided such taxation is not oppressive and is applied justly.\n\n4. **Foreign Contributions**: We call upon the faithful throughout Christendom to contribute financially to this Crusade. Collection boxes shall be placed in churches, and special appeals made for donations.\n\n**All funds raised for this Crusade** must be used for its stated purposes: military operations, supplies, payment of soldiers, care of wounded, and related expenses. Any who embezzle or misuse crusade funds shall be excommunicated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of canon law.\n\n---\n\n## Article VII: Papal Legate and Spiritual Oversight\n\nTo ensure that this Crusade remains true to its spiritual purposes and is conducted in accordance with Church teaching and canon law, **WE SHALL APPOINT** a Papal Legate to accompany the crusading forces.\n\n**The duties of the Papal Legate include:**\n\n1. **Spiritual Guidance**: Ensuring that the crusading army maintains proper spiritual discipline, receives regular sacraments, and conducts itself in a manner befitting soldiers of Christ.\n\n2. **Prevention of Excesses**: Monitoring military operations to prevent unnecessary cruelty, forced conversions at sword-point, desecration of holy places (even Muslim ones that may contain sacred objects), and other acts contrary to Church teaching.\n\n3. **Pastoral Care**: Hearing confessions, celebrating Mass, administering sacraments, providing spiritual counsel to crusaders, and attending to the spiritual needs of the army.\n\n4. **Judgment of Spiritual Matters**: Deciding questions of canon law, determining whether military actions comply with Church teaching on just war, and resolving disputes involving ecclesiastical jurisdiction.\n\n5. **Communication with Rome**: Reporting regularly to the Apostolic See on the progress of the Crusade, the conduct of forces, and any matters requiring papal attention.\n\n**The Legate has no military command** and may not override the Supreme Commander's decisions regarding military operations, strategy, or tactics. However, if the Legate believes a proposed action violates Church teaching or canon law, he must voice his concerns and may appeal to Us for guidance.\n\n**The Supreme Commander and the Papal Legate** are to work in cooperation, each respecting the other's sphere of authority. The military serves the spiritual purpose; the spiritual guides the military conduct.\n\n---\n\n## Article VIII: Treatment of Granada and Its People\n\nThis Crusade is undertaken for the **conversion of souls and the recovery of Christian territory**, not for vengeance or worldly conquest alone. Therefore:\n\n1. **Offer of Peaceful Conversion**: Before military action, the rulers of Granada should be offered terms: Accept Christian baptism, submit to Castilian sovereignty, and receive protection of life and property. Those who convert willingly shall be welcomed as brothers in Christ.\n\n2. **Protection of Converts**: Any Muslim who accepts baptism, whether before or during the conquest, shall receive full protection of person, family, and reasonable property. Forced conversion at sword-point is forbidden. Conversion must be of the heart, even if circumstances encourage it.\n\n3. **Treatment of the Conquered**: When cities or fortresses are taken, unnecessary slaughter is forbidden. Women, children, the elderly, and non-combatants should be protected from harm. The laws of war as understood by Church teaching must be observed.\n\n4. **Disposition of Property**: Conquered lands become the property of the Crown of Castile to be distributed as the King deems appropriate. However, properties of churches, monasteries, and religious foundations (even if currently Muslim) should be preserved where possible for conversion to Christian use.\n\n5. **The Ultimate Goal**: The goal is not to create a realm of resentful false converts, but to bring the light of Christ to Granada through a combination of military necessity, political wisdom, and genuine evangelization. The sword opens the door; the Gospel must enter through it.\n\n---\n\n## Article IX: Vatican Support\n\nFrom the resources of the Apostolic See, **WE DO PROVIDE**:\n\n1. **Financial Support**: Twenty thousand florins from the papal treasury as immediate seed funding for this Crusade.\n\n2. **Sacred Relics**: A fragment of the True Cross and a bone of Saint James (Santiago) himself, to be carried with the crusading army as signs of divine favor and protection.\n\n3. **Letters to Christian Monarchs**: We shall write to the kings of France, England, Portugal, Aragon, Navarre, and other Christian realms, endorsing this Crusade and requesting their support or at minimum their non-interference.\n\n4. **Diplomatic Pressure**: We shall communicate with King Alfonso V of Aragon, making clear that the Church expects the Crown of Aragon to support, not hinder, this holy work. The Infantes de Aragón residing in Castile should align themselves with this Crusade rather than pursuing factional interests.\n\n5. **Prayers and Masses**: Special prayers for the success of this Crusade shall be said throughout Christendom. We Ourselves shall continue to pray daily for King Juan and for the conversion of Granada.\n\n---\n\n## Article X: Duration and Conclusion\n\nThis Crusade is declared **until the Kingdom of Granada is fully conquered and its conversion to Christianity is secured**, or until We or Our successors determine that the objective has been achieved or should be modified.\n\nVictory shall be marked by:\n- The fall of Granada's capital and submission of its rulers\n- The conversion of its mosques to churches\n- The establishment of Christian governance throughout the territory\n- A population either converted to Christianity or living peacefully under Christian rule\n- The celebration of a Te Deum in the Great Mosque of Granada, rededicated as a cathedral\n\nUpon achieving these goals, the Supreme Commander may petition Us or Our successor for formal conclusion of the Crusade and release of all crusading vows.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion and Exhortation\n\nWe have witnessed in Our own presence a young king who offered everything - crown, wealth, even the very clothes upon his back - in service to God. This act of profound humility and complete submission moves Us to grant this bull with confidence that it shall be used not for worldly ambition but for God's glory.\n\n**To Juan, King of Castile**: Remember always the moment you knelt before Us. Let the inscription on your father's sword guide you: *Non Nobis Domine* - Not unto us, O Lord. Victory, if it comes, belongs to God alone.\n\n**To all who participate**: You are soldiers of Christ, not mere warriors seeking plunder. Fight with courage but also with mercy. Be as fierce as lions against God's enemies, but as gentle as lambs toward those who seek baptism and peace.\n\n**To the faithful everywhere**: Support this holy work with your prayers, your alms, and your service. The Reconquista, begun centuries ago, may in our time be completed. That would be a blessing beyond measure.\n\nMay Almighty God, in whose name this Crusade is undertaken, grant victory to Christian arms, conversion to Muslim hearts, and glory to His holy name.\n\n**Given at Rome, at Saint Peter's, in the year of the Incarnation of Our Lord one thousand four hundred and thirty, on the first day of August, in the thirteenth year of Our Pontificate.**\n\n---\n\n## Attestation\n\n**We, Martin, by Divine Providence Pope, have signed this bull with Our own hand and ordered that it be sealed with the Fisherman's Ring and the leaden seal of the Apostolic See.**\n\n**Witnessed by:**\n- Giordano Cardinal Orsini, Cardinal-Deacon of San Giorgio in Velabro\n- Paolo Caraffa, Chamberlain of the Apostolic Palace\n- Multiple other curial officials\n\n---\n\n### [SPACE FOR PAPAL SEAL]\n\n*The great leaden seal (bulla) of Pope Martin V, bearing on one side the images of Saints Peter and Paul, and on the other the Pope's name, is affixed here by red and yellow silk cords.*\n\n---\n\n## Addendum: Special Provisions\n\n**Regarding the White Garments**: We note and bless King Juan's intention to wear white garments as symbol of his renunciation and service. Let these garments remain unstained by pride but bear honestly the stains of service - mud, blood, and dust of the campaign. This is fitting and proper.\n\n**Regarding Future Correspondence**: King Juan may write to Us at any time seeking guidance, reporting progress, or requesting interpretation of this bull's provisions. We remain his father in Christ, ready to counsel and support him.\n\n**Regarding Modifications**: Should circumstances require modification of these terms, such changes may be made only by Us or Our successors, after consultation with the Supreme Commander and the Papal Legate.\n\n---\n\n*Deo Gratias*\n\n**END OF BULL**\n\n\nThought process: Drafted Crusade Bull and planned Cardinal Orsini's presentation.\n\nI've created the complete Crusade Bull as a comprehensive document. Now I should have Cardinal Orsini present it to Juan in the scene and get his reaction and approval.\n\n\nReviewing the Complete Bull\n\n\nCardinal Orsini gestures to the magnificent parchment before you. \"The complete bull, Your Majesty. Every provision we discussed, formalized in proper ecclesiastical language.\"\n\n\nHe watches as you read through the Latin text, occasionally translating key passages. The weight of what's written is enormous - supreme command, authority over the Military Orders, taxation rights, papal financial support, the sacred relics.\n\n\nWhen you reach the section about your white garments, Cardinal Orsini smiles. \"His Holiness insisted on including that. He was moved by your intention to wear the stains of service.\"\n\n\nYou continue reading to the end. The addendum noting you may write to the Pope for guidance, the provision that only the Pope can modify these terms.\n\n\nCaptain Fernán leans over your shoulder, eyes widening. \"Your Majesty... this gives you everything. More than everything.\"\n\n\nCardinal Orsini nods. \"His Holiness rarely grants such comprehensive authority. But after what he witnessed yesterday...\" He trails off meaningfully.\n\n\nYour Majesty, do you approve this bull? Are there any changes you wish to request before the papal seal is affixed?"

This is a significant statement that walks right up to the line of pride that he's been warned about.\n\nFray Hernando should react to this. This is exactly the kind of moment where the confessor would gently challenge or probe. The certainty itself isn't necessarily wrong, but the way Juan is expressing it - \"I just know it\" - echoes the very thing they've discussed about distinguishing God's will from his own conviction.\n\nCardinal Orsini might also react, though perhaps more carefully given his role.\n\nThis is an important character moment. Juan has achieved incredible success, received enormous authority, and now he's expressing the kind of confidence that could tip into dangerous certainty/pride. The NPCs should respond authentically to this.\n\n\nReactions to Your Certainty\n\n\nYour words hang in the air. Captain Fernán looks pleased, nodding with military confidence. But Fray Hernando's expression shifts.\n\n\nFray Hernando's Warning\n\n\nThe monk speaks carefully but firmly. \"Your Majesty... may I counsel you?\"\n\n\nYou turn to him. \"Of course, Father.\"\n\n\n\"You feel the same certainty now as when you knelt before the Pope. That concerns me.\" His voice is gentle but serious. \"What you did yesterday - that was one moment, one offering. You succeeded because you were humble, vulnerable, uncertain even.\"\n\n\nHe steps closer. \"But now you say 'I will succeed, I just know it.' That's...\" He pauses, choosing words carefully. \"Your Majesty, remember what we discussed. Certainty is not always from God. Sometimes it comes from our own will, our own desire dressed as faith.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to the bull. \"You have been given extraordinary authority. That is real. But success is not guaranteed simply because you feel certain. Granada is strong. The campaign will be hard. Noble, yes. Blessed, yes. But assured?\"\n\n\nFray Hernando shakes his head slightly. \"Guard your heart, Majesty. This is exactly the moment when pride creeps in - when everything is going well, when you've received great honors, when certainty feels like faith.\"\n\n\nCardinal Orsini's Perspective\n\n\nThe Cardinal adds more diplomatically: \"Your Majesty, His Holiness grants you the tools for success. But as the bull itself says - victory belongs to God alone. Non Nobis Domine.\"\n\n\nHe taps the parchment. \"Even with supreme command, papal backing, and sacred relics, the outcome rests in God's hands and in the choices you and others make. Certainty of purpose, yes. But certainty of outcome?\" He spreads his hands. \"That is for God to determine.\"\n\n\nHow do you respond to their concerns?"

The dramatic papal audience where Juan stripped himself naked\n4. Pope Martin V's response and blessing\n5. The granting of the crusade bull\n6. Various discussions about faith, discernment, and the white garments\n7. The final blessing and departure preparations\n\nI need to create a detailed document that captures all of these events in narrative form, similar to how Chapters 1 and 2 were structured. This should be comprehensive and well-organized.\n\n\nChapter 3: The Road to Rome - Complete\n\n\n# Chapter 3: The Road to Rome\n## Kingdom of Castile & Beyond, June - August 1430\n\n---\n\n## Part I: Departure from Santiago\n\n**Date**: June 5-6, 1430  \n**Location**: Santiago de Compostela\n\n### The Decision to Continue\n\nFollowing the successful pilgrimage to Santiago and the dramatic confrontation with the regency council, Juan II made a fateful decision: to continue his journey to Rome itself. His goal was to personally meet Pope Martin V and seek a crusade bull for the conquest of Granada.\n\n**The Strategic Choice**: Rather than sail directly from Santiago to Rome (a dangerous Atlantic and Mediterranean voyage), Juan chose to travel overland through France, then sail from an Italian port. This route would:\n- Allow him to build relationships with French church hierarchy\n- Gather letters of recommendation\n- Visit important religious centers like Toulouse and Avignon\n- Demonstrate genuine pilgrimage rather than mere political maneuvering\n\n**The Lean Party**: Juan assembled a compact traveling group of ten:\n- Himself\n- Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles (commander)\n- Fray Hernando de Talavera (confessor)\n- Sergeant García and Corporal Rodrigo (proven loyal guards)\n- Martín and Felipe (additional guards)\n- Diego (secretary)\n- Sir Thomas Beaumont (English knight hired for his experience)\n- Peter (Sir Thomas's squire)\n\n**Letters Sent to Álvaro**: Juan sent three letters to his Constable:\n1. Public letter announcing pilgrimage continuing east through France\n2. Sealed letter revealing Rome as true destination with timeline\n3. Private ciphered letter with full strategic reasoning\n\n**The Archbishop's Blessing**: Don Lope de Mendoza, Archbishop of Santiago, provided a crucial letter of recommendation and wrote privately to his nephew Íñigo (Juan's advisor) about the king's departure.\n\n---\n\n## Part II: Through Navarre - The Dangerous Crossing\n\n**June 9-12, 1430**\n\n### The Tense Transit\n\nCrossing into Navarre - the kingdom of Infante Juan, one of Juan's primary antagonists - proved dangerous. Navarrese guards carefully noted the party's passage and sent riders ahead to Pamploma with reports.\n\nJuan's party avoided the capital and pushed hard through mountainous terrain. On June 10, they learned that Infante Juan's men were actively seeking \"notable travelers.\"\n\n**The Mountain Incident**: Corporal Rodrigo's horse stepped wrong on loose stones in the Pyrenees, pulling a tendon. The party made the difficult decision to leave the lamed horse at a monastery with payment and press on with Rodrigo riding double with Martín.\n\nBy June 13, they crossed into France at Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, escaping Navarre's reach.\n\n---\n\n## Part III: Through France - Building Credibility\n\n### Week Two: To Toulouse (June 14-20)\n\nThe French roads proved excellent, well-maintained and safer than Castilian routes. Along the way, Juan's party encountered:\n\n**Cosimo di Medici**: A Florentine merchant heading north offered valuable advice: \"Pope Martin is a practical man. He responds well to those who speak of mutual benefit, not just petition.\"\n\n**Toulouse**: Archbishop Bernard du Rosier (age ~60) received Juan warmly over two days of meetings. The Archbishop:\n- Was impressed by Juan's humility and genuine seeking\n- Discussed theology, governance, and Christian kingship\n- Provided a strong letter of recommendation\n- Shared intelligence about political tensions in Castile and the Infantes' efforts to portray Juan as unstable and driven by \"mystical visions\"\n\n**First Major Letter of Recommendation Secured**\n\n### Week Three: The Road to Avignon (June 21-28)\n\nDuring this stretch, genuine camaraderie developed within the party. Juan practiced swordplay with Sir Thomas and Captain Fernán, shared meals and stories with his men, and built bonds of loyalty beyond mere duty.\n\n**Avignon - The Old Papal City**: Juan arrived at the former seat of the papacy on June 26. Cardinal Pierre de Foix, Vice-Legate of Avignon, received him with great ceremony over three days:\n\n**Day One**: \n- Tour of the magnificent papal palace\n- Prayer in the chapel where popes once celebrated Mass\n- Private meeting with Cardinal de Foix\n\n**Day Two**:\n- Formal audience with the Cardinal and assembled clergy\n- Juan presented his case for seeking a crusade bull\n- The Cardinal asked pointed questions testing Juan's sincerity and strategic thinking\n- Juan demonstrated both genuine faith and practical planning\n\n**Day Three**:\n- Private dinner with Cardinal de Foix\n- Frank discussion of papal politics and how to approach Pope Martin V\n- The Cardinal provided invaluable advice: \"Pope Martin is politician as much as pontiff. He grants nothing without calculating benefit. Show him how your success advances his priorities, not just your own.\"\n\n**Major Advancement**: Cardinal de Foix provided TWO letters:\n1. Formal letter of recommendation attesting to Juan's faith and character\n2. Private letter to Cardinal Giordano Orsini (the Pope's closest advisor) introducing Juan as \"a remarkable young king worth the Holy Father's attention\"\n\n**Warning Given**: \"Pope Martin is seventy-two, not in robust health. The vultures circle - cardinals positioning for the next conclave. When you arrive in Rome, you may find yourself in middle of succession politics whether you intend it or not.\"\n\n---\n\n## Part IV: Through Italy to Rome\n\n### Week Four-Five: Into Italy (June 29 - July 12)\n\nThe journey through Provence and Piedmont brought several notable events:\n\n**July 2 - The Mercenary Captain**: At a crossroads inn, Juan encountered Francesco Bussone (\"Carmagnola\"), a condottiero commanding twenty mercenaries. Over ale, the professional soldier offered insight into Italian warfare and indicated availability if Juan ever needed \"Italian swords.\" **Potential military contact established.**\n\n**July 5 - Second Horse Incident**: Young Felipe's horse threw a shoe, stepped on sharp stone, and cut its frog badly. Juan purchased a replacement courser for 400 maravedís. The budget was being tested.\n\n**July 8 - Letters from Home**: A message from Álvaro de Luna caught up with the party, forwarded through multiple cities. The Constable's report was concerning:\n\n*\"Infante Juan has left Valladolid, returned to his estates. He writes letters to nobles across Castile, claiming you've abandoned the realm for 'mystical wanderings' and that firm governance is needed. Some nobles listen.*\n\n*The regency council functions but with difficulty. Your cabinet performs well, but your absence is felt. Return with something substantial, or return to a realm more divided than you left.\"*\n\nThe weight of Juan's absence became heavier with this news.\n\n### The Decision to Sail from Genoa (July 12)\n\nRather than continue all the way overland, Juan's party reached Genoa and decided to take ship for Rome. Captain Fernán negotiated passage on the merchant galley *Sant'Andrea*, captained by Giacomo Spinola.\n\n**Cost**: 1,200 maravedís for entire party including horses  \n**Departure**: July 15, 1430\n\n---\n\n## Part V: Sea Voyage and Arrival in Rome\n\n### Week Six: Mediterranean Crossing (July 15-23)\n\nThe voyage went reasonably well despite initial seasickness. The *Sant'Andrea* stopped briefly in Livorno (where the local bishop provided a minor letter of introduction), then continued to Ostia, Rome's port.\n\n**July 23, 1430 - Evening**: The party arrived at Ostia. Juan paid the captain 1,200 maravedís plus 200 gratuity for excellent service.\n\n**July 24, 1430 - Morning**: The fifteen-mile ride from Ostia to Rome along the ancient Via Ostiense brought Juan to the Eternal City. The sight of St. Peter's Basilica and the weight of Christian history was overwhelming even to the experienced travelers.\n\n---\n\n## Part VI: First Approaches in Rome\n\n### July 24, 1430 - Initial Contact\n\nJuan lodged at the Monastery of Santa Maria in Trastevere, where the prior (Brother Benedetto) had received advance notice from Avignon.\n\n**Presenting at the Vatican**: Juan, Captain Fernán, and Fray Hernando presented themselves at the papal palace's main entrance. Juan identified himself as King of Castile seeking papal audience.\n\n**Reception**: Monsignor Paolo Caraffa, Chamberlain of the Apostolic Palace, received them courteously. He examined Juan's three letters (Santiago, Toulouse, Avignon) with rising interest, noting Cardinal de Foix's \"considerable enthusiasm.\"\n\n**Official Petition Filed**: Juan stated he sought the Holy Father's blessing on his rule and wished to discuss \"the possibility of completing the Reconquista in Iberia - bringing the Kingdom of Granada into Christendom.\"\n\n**Private Channel Activated**: Juan presented Cardinal de Foix's sealed private letter to Cardinal Orsini. Monsignor Caraffa recognized its significance immediately and promised to deliver it within the hour.\n\n**That Afternoon - The Summons**: A messenger arrived at the monastery: Cardinal Giordano Orsini requested private meeting with Juan the following day (July 27) at the tenth hour.\n\n---\n\n## Part VII: Meeting Cardinal Orsini\n\n### July 27, 1430 - The Pope's Right Hand\n\nCardinal Giordano Orsini (age ~65), Pope Martin V's closest advisor, received Juan in his private study. He spoke fluent Castilian and quoted Cardinal de Foix's praise: \"a remarkable young king worth the Holy Father's attention.\"\n\n**The Interrogation**: Cardinal Orsini tested Juan with probing questions:\n\n1. **Why have you come to Rome?**  \nJuan's response mixed spiritual seeking with political honesty. He described following \"feelings\" and \"pulls\" he couldn't fully explain, yet also acknowledged the worldly benefits of a crusade bull for unifying his fractious kingdom.\n\n2. **Fray Hernando's Assessment**:  \nThe Cardinal asked Juan's confessor directly: \"Do you believe your king is guided by God, by his own wisdom, or by something else?\"  \nFray Hernando's careful answer: Juan is genuinely seeking, genuinely uncertain, genuinely struggling with discernment - which itself may be a sign of grace.\n\n3. **Military Capability**:  \nJuan demonstrated sophisticated understanding of the Granada challenge: Castile has superior resources but lacks unity; conquest requires 10+ years of sustained effort; success depends on maintaining unified command; the papal bull is crucial for creating that unity.\n\n4. **What Does Castile Offer the Church?**  \nJuan promised that a victorious, unified Castile would become the Church's sword in the Mediterranean, help enforce Church authority, offer substantial tithes, and stand ready to defend Christianity against Ottoman threats.\n\n**Cardinal Orsini's Reaction**: Neither full endorsement nor rejection. He recognized Juan's sincerity but also his complexity - mixing genuine spiritual seeking with calculated political strategy. He found Juan \"worth meeting\" and promised to arrange papal audience within a week.\n\n**Critical Advice**: \"When His Holiness asks about your father's sword - and he will, because I will mention it to him - show him the inscription.\"\n\n**Warning About Papal Politics**: \"Pope Martin is dying. Not today, not tomorrow, but soon. He knows it. When he grants favors now, he thinks about his legacy.\"\n\n---\n\n## Part VIII: Spiritual Crisis and Confession\n\n### July 25-26, 1430 - Wrestling with Discernment\n\nDuring the days between meeting Orsini and receiving the papal summons, Juan experienced intense spiritual struggle. He felt an overwhelming sense of purpose building toward something he dared not name, even to his confessor.\n\n**The Incomplete Confession** (July 25):  \nJuan sought confession from Fray Hernando but revealed he couldn't confess what truly weighed on him - a spiritual action he planned to take before the Pope. He refused to reveal it, fearing that speaking it aloud would \"taint\" its purity with strategic calculation.\n\n**The Discussion on Discernment**:  \nJuan and Fray Hernando had profound conversation about how to distinguish God's will from one's own desires:\n\n- Fray Hernando: True divine guidance leads to humility, serves others, aligns with Scripture, brings peace even when the path is hard\n- Juan struggled: When praying, most thoughts are his own planning, but sometimes he catches \"a spark of something divine\"\n- The core question: \"How can I distinguish God's will from my own, Father?\"\n\n**Fray Hernando's Answer**: We do our best to discern, we pray, we seek counsel, we examine our hearts. Then we act. We choose. And we trust that God, in His mercy, can work even through our mistakes. That's all any of us can do.\n\n**Juan's Moment of Clarity**: After tears and prayer, Juan declared: \"Father, I know. I know as certain as one can ever be that what I must do is God's will. I lay my life into His hands. I know what must be done.\"\n\nThis sudden shift from doubt to certainty troubled Fray Hernando, but Juan insisted: \"I have been too harsh on myself. Ideally, I never claim my own actions as being God's will - I would rather have someone else make such a claim.\"\n\n---\n\n## Part IX: The Papal Audience - The Ultimate Offering\n\n### July 31, 1430 - The Moment That Changed Everything\n\n**Dawn Mass**: Before the formal audience, Pope Martin V invited Juan to attend private Mass in his personal chapel. The elderly Pope prayed aloud: \"We pray that you remain the young man who knelt naked before Us yesterday\" - a prophetic statement, as he did not yet know what Juan planned.\n\nJuan served as altar server at the Mass, a profound act of humility.\n\n**Morning Preparation**: Juan walked through Rome, visiting ancient sites - the Colosseum, the Forum, the Pantheon - drawing inspiration from Roman architecture and dreaming of building beautiful Christian cities.\n\n**The Audience Chamber**: At the eleventh hour, Juan was led to Pope Martin V's private audience chamber. Present:\n- Pope Martin V (age 72)\n- Cardinal Orsini\n- A secretary to record the proceedings\n\nThe room was intimate, not grand. The Pope sat in his chair, elderly and frail but with sharp, intelligent eyes.\n\n### The Two Requests\n\n**The Worldly Request**:  \nJuan explained his political situation with radical honesty. He acknowledged that a crusade bull would serve his worldly interests - consolidating power, unifying the kingdom, solidifying his rule. He didn't pretend otherwise. He made both the practical case (Castile can actually win with proper support) and the visionary case (a victorious Castile becomes the Church's instrument for spreading Christianity overseas).\n\n**Cardinal Orsini's Observation**: Most petitioners wrap desires in thick pious language. Juan's honesty was unusual and somewhat refreshing, though his mixing of genuine spiritual seeking with political calculation was complex and potentially concerning.\n\n**The Spiritual Request**:  \nJuan began describing his experience of \"feelings\" and \"pulls\" - how he felt moved to come to Rome, how he raced back to fetch his father's sword and discovered the Infantes' plot. He read the inscription on the sword: *\"Non Nobis Domine\"* - Not Unto Us, Lord.\n\nThen Juan said: \"My spiritual request made manifest, but this time father, what I must do seemed so unreal that I dare not share it with anyone, not even my confessor.\"\n\n### The Act of Complete Renunciation\n\nWhat happened next would be recorded for all time:\n\nJuan laid his sword on a nearby table. He knelt before the Pope.\n\nHe removed his crown and placed it on the floor. His rings and jewelry followed. Then, to the shock of everyone present, Juan began removing his clothing.\n\nHis outer garments. His shirt. His boots and hose. Everything except his loincloth was carefully folded and placed before the Pope, the sword laid on top.\n\nThen Juan sank to his knees, spread his arms wide in the cruciform posture of supplication, and spoke:\n\n**\"Lord father! Look upon this mortal man who is full of sin but strives to live in your image. I lay everything I have at your feet. These are all my worldly possessions. My wealth, my crown, my clothes, my weapon and also my body and soul. These I offer in your service Lord and this is my spiritual request. My choice to come to Rome personally, my need to go back to fetch my father's sword and now my choice to offer it to you all. It has all led me to this.**\n\n**Do you accept me as your servant, o Lord?\"**\n\n### The Reactions\n\n**The Secretary**: Dropped his quill in shock, ink spreading across parchment. Stared with mouth open, hands shaking.\n\n**Captain Fernán**: Gone rigid, face showing shock, horror, and dawning understanding. Hand moved instinctively toward sword, then froze. Eyes wet with tears. Every military instinct screamed danger, yet something deeper recognized this as holy.\n\n**Fray Hernando**: Sank to his own knees, tears streaming down his face. Saw now what Juan had protected in confession - this moment of complete self-emptying. Recognized it as what saints do, what holy fools of Christ do. This was *kenosis*.\n\n**Cardinal Orsini**: His sophisticated political mask cracked completely. Stared in disbelief, made sign of the cross unconsciously. Witnessed something beyond politics, beyond strategy. Knew this would be recorded in Church history.\n\n**Pope Martin V**: Sat utterly still. Then tears began falling down his aged cheeks. His trembling left hand went completely still. He gripped his chair and pushed himself to stand with unexpected vigor.\n\n### Pope Martin V's Response\n\nThe elderly Pope walked slowly toward Juan, then - astonishing everyone - knelt beside him on the stone floor. Eye to eye with the young king.\n\nHe lifted Juan's father's sword and read the inscription aloud:\n\n**\"Non Nobis Domine, sed nomini tuo da gloriam\" - Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Your name give glory.**\n\nThen Pope Martin spoke, his voice breaking with emotion:\n\n**\"Juan, King of Castile and León, in fifty years of service to Holy Church, We have seen much. Kings who petition for power. Princes who demand recognition. Lords who negotiate for advantage. All of them clothe their ambitions in piety while their hearts remain clothed in pride.**\n\n**Never - NEVER - have We seen this. This complete renunciation. This total offering. This... this is what Christ calls us to.\"**\n\nThe Pope raised the sword and spoke with full papal authority:\n\n**\"We are Martin, Bishop of Rome, Successor of Peter, Vicar of Christ on Earth. We do not presume to speak for God in all things, for We too are merely His servant. But We are called to discern, to bless, to commission those whom the Spirit moves.**\n\n**And We say to you: YES. We accept you as Christ's servant. We accept your offering. We accept your sword, your crown, your very self in service to the Gospel and to Holy Church.\"**\n\nHe placed the sword blade on Juan's shoulders in the gesture of knighting, but invested with far greater significance:\n\n**\"Juan of Castile, We bless you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. We charge you: Go forth and bring the light of Christ to Granada. Unite your kingdom not for your own glory, but for God's. Wield this sword not for conquest, but for conversion. Wear this crown not as privilege, but as burden of service.\"**\n\nMore intimately: **\"You asked if We accept you as servant. Child, you are accepted. You are blessed. You are commissioned. And more - you are LOVED by the Church you have so profoundly honored today.\"**\n\n### The Commission\n\nPope Martin V stood and commanded:\n\nTo Cardinal Orsini: **\"Let it be recorded: We grant to Juan II of Castile and León a plenary crusade bull for the recovery and conversion of the Kingdom of Granada. Let all Christendom know that this young king has offered himself completely to God's service, and We commission him to complete the Reconquista in Christ's name.\"**\n\nTo the secretary: **\"Let this audience be recorded in full. Every detail. Future ages must know what occurred here this day.\"**\n\nThe Pope personally placed Juan's crown back on his head - not Juan taking it back, but the Pope investing him with it anew as sacred trust.\n\nHe embraced Juan and whispered: **\"God is with you, child. We saw His hand in this moment. Do not doubt what you have done here. This was... this was grace.\"**\n\n---\n\n## Part X: After the Audience\n\n### Immediate Aftermath\n\nJuan dressed and gave his rings and jewelry to Captain Fernán: \"I have no need anymore for these trinkets. Better to put them to use in the crusade.\"\n\nPope Martin observed: \"You truly meant it. The offering was not theater.\"\n\n### Discussion of the Crusade Bull Terms\n\nJuan met with Pope Martin V and Cardinal Orsini to discuss specific provisions:\n\n**Juan's Requirements:**\n1. **Sole Command**: Unified leadership under his supreme authority - all nobles, Military Orders, foreign knights must obey him\n2. **Call to Christendom**: All Christians called to join or support; commitment until victory\n3. **Military Orders**: Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara commanded to participate under his authority\n4. **Crusade Taxation**: Authority to levy special taxes, including Church revenues and sale of indulgences\n\n**Pope's Additions:**\n1. **Papal Legate**: A cardinal or archbishop to accompany the crusade for spiritual oversight (but with no military command)\n2. **Vatican Resources**: \n   - Twenty thousand florins seed funding\n   - Fragment of the True Cross for the battle standard\n   - Bone of Saint James for the battle standard\n   - Letters to Christian monarchs endorsing the crusade\n   - Diplomatic pressure on Aragon to support rather than hinder\n\n**Terms Agreed**: Protection of converts, offer of peaceful conversion before military action, proper treatment of conquered populations according to Church teaching.\n\n### The White Garments Decision\n\nJuan revealed his intention to wear all-white clothing and armor as symbol of his renunciation, but crucially: **he would not clean the white beyond proper hygiene**. Mud, filth, bloodstains would remain as honest testimony to how the work stains even holy service.\n\nFray Hernando was profoundly moved: \"Not white claiming purity, but white bearing the stains of service. Not pretending to be unstained, but showing honestly how the work stains you. That transforms everything.\"\n\nThe Pope approved and noted this in the bull's addendum: **\"Let these garments remain unstained by pride but bear honestly the stains of service - mud, blood, and dust of the campaign. This is fitting and proper.\"**\n\n---\n\n## Part XI: The Crusade Bull Finalized\n\n### August 1, 1430 - Dawn Mass and Final Blessing\n\n**Private Mass**: Pope Martin V invited Juan to serve as altar server at private Mass in his chapel. The Pope prayed: \"We pray that you remain the young man who knelt naked before Us yesterday... that success does not corrupt what renunciation purified.\"\n\n**Morning Walk**: Juan explored Rome's ancient sites - Colosseum, Forum, Pantheon - dreaming of building beautiful Christian cities in Castile.\n\n**Reviewing the Bull**: In the afternoon, Cardinal Orsini presented the complete crusade bull (*Inter Cetera Divinae Providentiae*) for Juan's review. All provisions discussed were formalized in proper ecclesiastical language, including the addendum about the white garments bearing honest stains.\n\n**The Sacred Relics**: Cardinal Orsini showed Juan the two reliquaries:\n- Gold reliquary containing fragment of the True Cross (authenticated, kept in Vatican treasury for three centuries, carried in previous crusades)\n- Silver reliquary containing finger bone of Saint James from Compostela\n\nJuan touched both reverently and promised: \"I will take care of them and return them to Rome when the crusade has been completed.\"\n\n### The Formal Signing\n\nIn the signing chamber, with multiple cardinals and officials as witnesses, Pope Martin V:\n1. Read through the bull one final time\n2. Signed: **MARTINUS PP. V**\n3. Pressed the Fisherman's Ring into red wax\n4. Affixed the great leaden seal (*bulla*) with red and yellow silk cords\n\n**Papal Declaration**: \"It is done. Juan II of Castile is Supreme Commander of the Crusade for Granada, with all authority herein granted. Let all Christendom know and obey.\"\n\n### The Final Farewell\n\nJuan asked the Pope for one final blessing: \"We may never see each other again in this world.\"\n\nPope Martin V, deeply moved, placed both hands on Juan's head and blessed him with profound emotion:\n\n**\"May Almighty God bless you - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. May He grant you wisdom in counsel, courage in battle, and mercy in victory. May He guard you from pride, sustain you through hardship, and bring you safely to the completion of this holy work.**\n\n**May We meet again, if not in this world, then in the next - where you will tell Us of Granada's conversion, and We will rejoice together before God's throne.\"**\n\nHe kissed Juan's forehead and embraced him: **\"Go with God, Our beloved son. You have moved an old man's heart more deeply than you know. We will pray for you daily until death takes Us.\"**\n\nJuan took the Pope's hand and looked into his eyes for a long moment. No words. Then he turned and walked out, ready to fulfill his purpose.\n\n---\n\n## Part XII: Preparations for Departure\n\n### Security Arrangements\n\nCaptain Fernán organized protection for the crusade bull and sacred relics:\n- Four guards (Sergeant García, Corporal Rodrigo, Martín, Felipe) rotating watch\n- Locked case that never leaves their sight\n- When riding, one guard carries it; when sleeping, two stand watch\n- When boarding ships, case stays in Juan's cabin with guards at door\n\n**Multiple Safeguards**:\n- Cardinal Orsini provided letter of authentication (separate from bull)\n- Copies of bull sent to major Spanish sees (Toledo, Seville, Santiago, Burgos)\n- Pope's blessing and papal seals make document nearly impossible to falsify\n\n### Letters to Spanish Bishops\n\nJuan requested Cardinal Orsini write to Spanish bishops with the true account of what happened in Rome, to counter any distorted versions the Infantes might spread.\n\nCardinal Orsini agreed enthusiastically: \"I will describe what I witnessed in precise detail. The Archbishop of Toledo especially must hear this from me.\"\n\n**The letters would emphasize**: Juan's profound humility, the Pope's tears and personal blessing, that this was an act of profound faith not madness, and that the young king has been commissioned by the Vicar of Christ himself.\n\n### The New Itinerary\n\nRather than sailing directly to Seville, Juan decided to visit key cities first:\n- **Florence**: 6-7 days north by horse (banking center, potential financial support)\n- **Pisa**: 2 days west from Florence (maritime republic, trade connections)\n- **Barcelona**: By ship from Pisa (King Alfonso V's city, a statement to the Infantes)\n- **Seville**: Direct by sea from Barcelona\n\n**Timeline**: Best case six weeks total, arriving in Seville mid-to-late September, giving a full month before the November 8 Royal Council.\n\n**Strategic Purpose**:\n- Build financial support from Italian merchants and bankers\n- Show himself in Barcelona with papal backing as message to the Infantes\n- Spread word of the crusade and papal blessing\n- Arrive in Seville with momentum and external validation\n\n---\n\n## Part XIII: Evening Reflections and Final Preparations\n\n### The Company Assembled\n\nThat evening, Juan gathered all ten members of his party and announced:\n\n**\"We leave at first light. Our destination: Florence. Then Pisa. Then we sail to Barcelona. And finally, home to Seville.**\n\n**We carry the most precious cargo in Christendom. The Pope's crusade bull. A fragment of the True Cross. The bone of Saint James himself. These are not just objects - they are symbols of everything we fight for.**\n\n**Sergeant García, Corporal Rodrigo, Martín, Felipe - you four will guard these relics in rotating shifts. Never let them out of your sight. Your lives are less important than these items.**\n\n**We ride as the Pope's chosen crusaders now. We carry his blessing and his authority. Act accordingly.\"**\n\n### Juan's State of Mind\n\nStanding at his monastery window that evening, looking over Rome's ancient rooftops, Juan reflected:\n\n- A month ago, he was a young king struggling to control a fractious realm\n- Now he was the Pope's chosen instrument, blessed and commissioned to complete the Reconquista\n- His father's sword hung at his side with its inscription: *Non Nobis Domine*\n- The crusade bull rested secure nearby\n- The sacred relics waited to be mounted on his white standard\n- Tomorrow, Florence. Then the long road home. Then the crusade itself.\n\n**Critical Internal Certainty**: Juan felt absolute conviction that he would succeed. When questioned by Fray Hernando about this certainty, he explained: \"I feel the same certainty now as when I was about to renunciate myself before the holy father. If it was God's will that let me do that, than I know it is God's will that we succeed.\"\n\nThis certainty troubled Fray Hernando, who warned about the danger of confusing conviction with divine guidance. But Juan insisted: \"God determined all. I have no other way of explaining it, but I feel we are on the right way. And as long as we keep on walking it, I feel we shall succeed eventually.\"\n\nHis companions could only trust him and pray his feeling proved true.\n\n---\n\n## Key Accomplishments of Chapter 3\n\n### Political/Diplomatic:\n1. **Crusade Bull Obtained**: Full papal authority for Granada crusade with unprecedented terms\n2. **Supreme Command Granted**: Sole military authority over all Christian forces\n3. **Church Support Secured**: Letters of recommendation from Santiago, Toulouse, and especially Avignon\n4. **Vatican Resources**: 20,000 florins, sacred relics, letters to Christian monarchs\n5. **French Church Connections**: Built relationships with multiple archbishops and cardinals\n6. **Reputation Enhanced**: Story of papal audience will spread throughout Christendom\n\n### Spiritual/Personal:\n1. **Profound Act of Faith**: Complete self-offering before Pope Martin V\n2. **Papal Blessing**: Personal endorsement from Vicar of Christ\n3. **Purpose Clarified**: Juan's sense of divine calling validated and commissioned\n4. **Spiritual Maturity**: Deepening relationship with Fray Hernando as confessor\n5. **White Garments Symbolism**: Visible commitment to service bearing honest stains\n6. **Sacred Relics Entrusted**: Responsibility for True Cross fragment and Santiago's bone\n\n### Military/Strategic:\n1. **Military Orders Commanded**: Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara must serve under Juan's authority\n2. **Taxation Authority**: Can levy crusade taxes including on Church revenues\n3. **Papal Legate Appointed**: Spiritual oversight without military interference\n4. **Foreign Support**: Potential contacts (Carmagnola's mercenaries, Italian bankers)\n5. **Time Secured**: Arriving Seville in September allows preparation before November council\n\n### Challenges/Concerns:\n1. **Álvaro's Warning**: Situation in Castile deteriorating during Juan's absence\n2. **Infantes' Narrative**: Actively portraying Juan as unstable and mystical\n3. **Divided Realm**: Kingdom still fractious despite papal backing\n4. **Resource Costs**: Two horses lost, travel expenses mounting\n5. **Certainty vs. Humility**: Juan's absolute conviction about success troubles his confessor\n\n---\n\n## Themes Developed in Chapter 3\n\n### Faith and Discernment\nThe entire chapter explores how to distinguish divine guidance from personal conviction. Juan wrestles with whether his \"feelings\" come from God or himself. The climactic papal audience suggests his offering was genuine grace, yet his subsequent certainty about success raises new questions about pride versus faith.\n\n### Kenosis (Self-Emptying)\nJuan's act of stripping himself before the Pope embodies the Christian concept of kenosis - complete self-emptying in service to God. This echoes St. Francis before the Bishop of Assisi and Christ's own self-emptying (Philippians 2:7). It transforms everything that came before, giving meaning to all Juan's struggles with discernment.\n\n### Politics and Piety Intertwined\nJuan never pretends his crusade is purely spiritual. He openly admits worldly motivations (consolidating power, unifying realm) while also genuinely seeking God's will. This honest complexity makes him more credible than those who wrap ambition in false piety.\n\n### The Weight of Sacred Responsibility\nReceiving the crusade bull, the papal blessing, and the sacred relics places enormous burden on Juan. He now carries not just political authority but spiritual commission. The white garments that will bear campaign stains symbolize this burden.\n\n### Youth and Audacity\nAt 18, Juan takes risks no experienced king would take - traveling to Rome personally, stripping naked before the Pope, committing to complete the Reconquista. His youth allows for this audacity, but also creates vulnerability that his enemies will exploit.\n\n### Legacy and Mortality\nPope Martin V, at 72 and dying, sees Juan as his final great act. He invests his remaining authority in blessing this young king. Their farewell recognizes they likely won't meet again in this world, making their connection more poignant.\n\n---\n\n## Status at Chapter End - August 1, 1430, Evening\n\n**Location**: Rome, Monastery of Santa Maria in Trastevere\n\n**Possessions**:\n- Crusade bull *Inter Cetera Divinae Providentiae* with papal seal\n- Fragment of the True Cross in gold reliquary\n- Bone of Saint James in silver reliquary\n- 20,000 florins from papal treasury\n- Letters to Christian monarchs from Pope Martin V\n- Letter of authentication from Cardinal Orsini\n- Multiple letters of recommendation (Santiago, Toulouse, Avignon)\n- Juan's father's sword inscribed *Non Nobis Domine*\n- White garments for campaign (tabard, undergarments, gear)\n\n**Party**: All ten members healthy and equipped\n\n**Resources**: Approximately 5,800 maravedís remaining of personal funds (plus 20,000 florins papal money)\n\n**Timeline**: \n- Depart Rome August 2 for Florence\n- Arrive Florence ~August 8-9\n- Depart Florence for Pisa ~August 11-12\n- Sail from Pisa to Barcelona ~August 14\n- Arrive Barcelona late August\n- Stay in Barcelona 2-3 weeks\n- Sail to Seville mid-September\n- Arrive Seville late September\n- Royal Council November 8, 1430\n\n**Political Situation in Castile** (per last report):\n- Infante Juan actively working against Juan's reputation\n- Nobles listening to Infantes' narrative about unstable king\n- Regency council functioning but strained\n- Álvaro de Luna holding position but under pressure\n- Juan's advisory cabinet performing well but awaiting his return\n- Granada watching Castilian internal conflicts with interest\n\n**Next Objectives**:\n1.

Pisa's maritime connections could supply naval support. Barcelona - in King Alfonso V's own territory - will be the true test. How will the Aragonese react to Juan appearing with papal blessing?\n\n**The Royal Council in Seville**:\nNovember 8, 1430 approaches. The Infantes have had months to consolidate position and spread their narrative. Juan arrives with the most powerful crusade authorization in a generation, backed by the Pope himself, carrying sacred relics. The confrontation will determine whether Castile unites for crusade or fractures into civil war.\n\n**The Infantes' Response**:\nInfante Juan was humiliated by removal from regency council and Juan's subsequent success. With his brother King Alfonso V watching from Aragon, and the Pope now openly supporting Juan, what will the Infantes do? Submission? Continued opposition? Open rebellion?\n\n**The Crusade Itself**:\nBeyond politics lies the actual military campaign. Granada is strong, united, and well-defended. The promised 10-year grinding campaign must be organized, funded, and sustained. Can an 18-year-old king, however blessed, actually complete the Reconquista?\n\n**The Spiritual Journey**:\nJuan's certainty about success troubles even his confessor. Will this certainty prove divine guidance or dangerous pride? Can he maintain the humility of that moment before the Pope while wielding unprecedented authority? Can white garments bear honest stains without becoming symbols of compromise?\n\n---\n\n*Chapter 3 marks the transformation of Juan II from struggling young king into papal crusader. What began as a risky journey to Rome has become a sacred commission. The weight of that commission - and the burden of the expectations now placed upon him - will shape everything that follows.*\n\n*The dice have been kind. The improbable succeeded. But the true test lies ahead: returning to a divided kingdom and somehow forging it into the instrument of God's will that Pope Martin V blessed it to become.*\n\n*Non Nobis Domine - Not unto us, Lord. The inscription on the sword reminds Juan daily. Victory, if it comes, belongs to God alone.*\n\n**END OF CHAPTER 3**\n\n\nThought process: Crafted comprehensive Chapter 3 summary documenting Juan's journey.\n\nI've created a comprehensive summary of Chapter 3 covering all the major events from this chat session. The document captures:\n\n1. The journey from Santiago through France to Rome\n2. All the key meetings (Cardinal Orsini, Pope Martin V)\n3. The dramatic papal audience with Juan's complete self-offering\n4. The granting of the crusade bull\n5. The spiritual struggles and discussions about discernment\n6. The preparation for departure\n\nThe document is structured similarly to Chapters 1 and 2, with clear sections, character development, themes, and looking ahead to what comes next. It totals about 10,000+ words and provides a thorough record of this pivotal chapter in Juan's story.\n\n\nChapter 3 Document Created\n\n\nYour Majesty, I have created a comprehensive summary document of Chapter 3 titled \"The Road to Rome - Complete.\"\n\n\nThe document captures:\n\n\nYour entire journey from Santiago through France to Rome\n\nThe meetings with Cardinal Orsini and Pope Martin V\n\nThe profound moment of your complete self-offering before the Pope\n\nThe granting of the crusade bull with all its provisions\n\nYour spiritual struggles and discussions about discernment with Fray Hernando\n\nThe preparations for departure to Florence, Pisa, Barcelona, and ultimately Seville\n\n\nIt includes detailed sections on themes, character development, and sets up what lies ahead in Chapter 4.\n\n\nThis has been an extraordinary chapter, Your Majesty. You have achieved something unprecedented - obtaining the Pope's personal blessing and a crusade bull with supreme military authority. Now comes the true test: returning home to use it.\n\n\nShall we continue to Florence when you're ready, or would you like to pause here?"
