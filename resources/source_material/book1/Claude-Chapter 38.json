      "say": "Thought process: Thinking about narrative context for approaching a sultan's surrender negotiation.\n\nThe user wants to start Chapter 38 where they will approach the Sultan of Granada and ask him to surrender. They want me to look at the project files to understand the current situation.\n\nLet me search the project knowledge to understand:\n1. The current military situation\n2. The sultan's position and character\n3. Recent events leading to this moment\n4. Juan's relationship with the sultan\n5. The current state of the crusade\n\nI need to understand where we are in the campaign and what the context is for this surrender request.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process\n\nLet me search for more information about the most recent chapter (37) and the current situation with the Sultan and Granada.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process\n\nPerfect, I now have a clear picture. Let me search for information about Sultan Yusuf III/IV (there seems to be some confusion in the naming - let me check) and his current position and character.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process\n\nGood, I have a comprehensive understanding now. Let me look for the character tracker to see if there's updated information about Sultan Yusuf.\n\n\nView: Check the character tracker for Sultan Yusuf's current information\n\n\nThought process: Reconciled timeline inconsistencies and prepared diplomatic scenario setup.\n\nThe character tracker is quite outdated (End of Chapter 18, April 1431), and we're now at the start of Chapter 38 (September 1432). I need to search for more current information about Sultan Yusuf III/IV (there seems to be some inconsistency in the naming in the documents).\n\nLet me set up the scene. Based on what I've read:\n\n1. Date: September 2, 1432 (end of Chapter 37)\n2. Location: Fortified camp outside Granada city\n3. Military Situation: Juan has ~21,700 troops in a heavily fortified camp northwest of Granada. The city has ~9,500 garrison troops, 50,000 civilians, 4-6 months of food stores, and is receiving ~30-40% of normal supply intake.\n4. External Operations: Motril about to fall, Salobreña next target, southern valleys being pacified\n5. Sultan's Position: Facing mathematical inevitability of defeat. Timeline to starvation: January-March 1433\n6. Campaign history: Juan has been methodical, honorable in negotiations, demonstrated mercy to surrendering garrisons, but also ruthless in destroying crops and starving the city\n\nNow the player wants to approach the Sultan and ask him to surrender. This is a major diplomatic moment. I need to:\n1. Start Chapter 38\n2. Set the scene at the Granada camp\n3. Wait for Juan to tell me what he wants to do specifically about approaching the Sultan\n\nAccording to the rules, I should NEVER write Juan's words or actions. I should describe the situation and wait for the player to tell me what Juan does.\n\nLet me start with a brief scene-setting that establishes the current situation and then stops to ask Juan what his approach is.\n\n\nChapter 38: The Sultan's Answer\n\n\nDate: September 2, 1432\nLocation: Fortified camp outside Granada city\n\n\n\nThe afternoon sun beat down on the Castilian camp, the September heat lingering despite the approach of autumn. From the elevated command platform, Granada sprawled before you—massive walls, the Alhambra fortress gleaming red on its heights, the Nasrid green banners hanging limp in the still air. Fifty thousand souls behind those walls. Nine thousand soldiers. Four to six months of food, if the estimates were accurate.\n\n\nÃlvaro de Luna stood beside you, studying the city through narrowed eyes. \"Word from the Master of Calatrava arrived an hour ago. The breach at Motril is complete. He expects surrender within two days, three at most. Then Salobreña.\" He paused. \"By mid-September, every coastal port will be ours. Granada will be completely landlocked.\"\n\n\nFrom the command tent behind you came the sounds of the camp—soldiers drilling, smiths hammering, the low hum of an army that had learned to wait patiently. Twenty-one thousand men who had survived four and a half months of grinding attrition. The fortifications they'd built were impressive: earth ramparts, elevated crossbow platforms, proper siege lines. Not a temporary camp, but a statement of permanence.\n\n\n\"The garrison's behavior has shifted,\" Don Fadrique reported, gesturing toward the northern gates visible from your position. \"No sorties in six days. Their cavalry formations that used to contest our every movement now stay close to the walls. They're watching us, calculating.\"\n\n\nMartÃ­n—Commander MartÃ­n ibn Ahmad, who had once defended Granada's fortresses and now advised you—approached with his characteristic measured tread. \"Your Majesty, if I may observe: Sultan Yusuf knows mathematics as well as we do. Once the ports fall, the timeline becomes inevitable. He faces a choice between negotiating surrender from a position of some dignity now, or waiting until his people are starving and desperate in January or February.\" He paused. \"The question is whether his pride, or his nobles' pressure, allows him to make that choice.\"\n\n\nThe question hung in the air: Did you wait for the Sultan to send envoys, letting hunger do its work? Or did you take the initiative, offering terms before the situation became more desperate?\n\n\nWhat is your approach?"

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated diplomatic scene setup, stopping before Juan's formal demand.\n\nThe player wants Juan to make a dramatic formal surrender demand. This is a significant moment - approaching Granada with crusaders, military orders, white banner, white armor, under flag of truce. This is a persuasion/diplomatic scenario, not a chaos scenario.\n\nLet me think about what needs to happen:\n\n1. First, I need to narrate the assembly and preparation\n2. Then the march to Granada's gates\n3. Then stop when Juan needs to speak or make the actual demand\n\nI should NOT write what Juan says when he gets to the gates. That's his dialogue. I should stop when it's time for him to speak.\n\nKey elements to include:\n- The visual spectacle of this assembly\n- Reactions of commanders\n- The march to the gates\n- Granada's response to seeing this formation approach\n- Set up the scene at the gates, then STOP for Juan to speak\n\nThis is during active dialogue/negotiation, so I should keep it relatively short and stop frequently. Let me aim for maybe 4-6 paragraphs to get him to the gates, then stop.\n\n\nThe command went out across the camp within minutes. Trumpets sounded the assembly—not the call to battle, but something different. The call for crusaders.\n\n\nFrom every corner of the fortified positions, they came. The sworn crusaders, those who had taken formal vows in churches across Christendom. Perhaps two hundred men now, after casualties and attrition—Italians, Germans, French, Portuguese, English, and Castilians bound by a shared oath. They assembled in formation, their white crosses brilliant against varied surcoats.\n\n\nThe Military Orders formed beside them with professional precision. The Master of Santiago's knights, black crosses on white. Calatrava's red crosses. Alcántara's green. Perhaps eight hundred knights total, the warrior-monks who had fought the Moors for generations. Master Luis de Guzmán rode forward, his eyes gleaming. \"Your Majesty commands, and Santiago answers.\"\n\n\nFray Hernando brought the white banner himself, the Guardian Company forming its escort. The silk caught the afternoon light, pristine despite months of campaigning. Behind it, the reliquaries—the True Cross fragment and Santiago's bone in their gold and silver.\n\n\nYour squires brought the white Milanese armor, piece by piece. The weight settled on your shoulders with familiar pressure—breastplate, pauldrons, vambraces, the full harness of a Christian king making formal demand. The white plume fixed to your helmet. Your father's sword at your side, Non Nobis Domine etched in the steel.\n\n\nÃlvaro watched the assembly with something like awe. \"A thousand warriors under crusader banners and white armor. If this doesn't move them...\" He didn't finish the thought.\n\n\nThe white flag of truce went up—a pure white standard carried by one of the Guardian Company. The formation began to move: the white banner at the center, you beneath it in white armor, crusaders and Military Orders arrayed in disciplined ranks, the reliquaries gleaming.\n\n\nThe march toward Granada's northern gate took perhaps ten minutes. Long enough for the garrison to see what was coming. Long enough for alarm bells to ring from the walls. Long enough for word to spread through the city that something unprecedented was approaching.\n\n\nYou could see figures gathering on the battlements—hundreds of them, soldiers and citizens alike drawn by the spectacle. The green Nasrid banners stirred in a slight breeze. The gates remained closed, but a cluster of officers appeared on the wall above them, ornate armor catching the sun.\n\n\nThe formation halted perhaps eighty yards from the gate—close enough to be heard clearly, far enough to demonstrate peaceful intent under the truce flag. The thousand men behind you fell silent with professional discipline. The white banner snapped once in the breeze, the only sound.\n\n\nA figure on the wall stepped forward—older, wearing the rich armor of high rank, a commander's authority in his bearing even at this distance. Other officers flanked him, perhaps a dozen men of obvious importance. They were studying you, studying the formation, calculating what this meant.\n\n\nThe silence stretched. Granada waited. Your army waited.\n\n\nThe gates before you held the last Muslim kingdom in Iberia."

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed diplomatic success factors against Sultan's pride and religious resistance.\n\nThis is a major diplomatic moment. Juan is making a formal surrender demand in a very particular way - respectful, acknowledging the military reality, offering negotiation, dismounting to show vulnerability and peaceful intent, opening with Islamic greeting. This is a Persuasion Roll, not a Chaos Roll, per the rules.\n\nLet me think about the success and failure factors for Sultan Yusuf IV's response.\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (Things working in Juan's favor):\n1. **Military Reality is Undeniable**: Granada is completely surrounded, ports about to fall, food running out in 4-6 months. This is mathematical inevitability.\n2. **Juan's Demonstrated Honor**: Throughout the campaign, Juan has kept his word to surrendering garrisons (Loja, Málaga, Moclin, Alhama after bombardment, etc.). This reputation matters.\n3. **Respectful Approach**: Juan dismounted, used Islamic greeting, acknowledged both sides fought with honor, no gloating or humiliation. This gives the Sultan a dignified path.\n4. **Spectacular Display**: 1,000 crusaders and knights, white banner, relics, white armor. This shows strength but also seriousness - Juan brought his sacred symbols to a negotiation.\n5. **Timing**: Offering terms now, before starvation becomes critical, gives Sultan better negotiating position than waiting until January.\n6. **Population Pressure**: 50,000 civilians watching their food dwindle will create internal pressure on the Sultan to negotiate.\n7. **Garrison Morale Shift**: The garrison has already shifted from aggressive to defensive/calculating per Chapter 37. They see the mathematics.\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (Things working against Juan):\n1. **Sultan's Pride**: Yusuf IV is the last Muslim ruler in Iberia. Surrendering means ending 700+ years of Islamic Al-Andalus. Enormous psychological/cultural weight.\n2. **Religious Dimension**: This isn't just political - it's the end of Islamic rule in Iberia. \n\nThe potential for resistance runs deep. Religious leaders will likely mobilize against surrender, seeing negotiation as spiritual capitulation. The complex hostage system that maintains political control could unravel if the Sultan shows weakness. Nobles might view potential terms as a fundamental threat to their status and power. Despite overwhelming mathematical odds, a desperate hope for miraculous intervention persists, fueled by cultural and religious pride.\n\nPsychological dynamics favor delaying immediate pain. Surrender feels like instant humiliation, while starvation remains an abstract future threat. Garrison commanders, particularly hardliners, might actively resist negotiation attempts, creating internal political friction. The uncertainty of potential conversion and unknown surrender terms intensifies collective anxiety.\n\nThe decision landscape is fraught with emotional and strategic complexities that transcend pure military calculation. Pride, fear, and hope intertwine, making rational choice challenging.\n\n\nYour voice carried clearly across the open ground to the walls. The Islamic greeting, the measured tone, the acknowledgment of shared suffering—all carefully chosen. Then you folded your hands in prayer, standing alone before the gates in your white armor, the thousand warriors silent behind you.\n\n\nThe figures on the wall conferred urgently. Minutes passed. You could see messengers running along the battlements, disappearing into the city. The older commander—clearly someone of high rank—kept his eyes fixed on you, studying every detail of the formation, the white banner, the relics gleaming in the sun.\n\n\nFifteen minutes of prayer. Twenty. The army behind you remained perfectly still, disciplined patience radiating from their ranks. Your knees pressed into the earth, hands folded, a Christian king in supplication before God and Granada both.\n\n\nBefore I roll for the Sultan's response, let me assess the success and failure factors:\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\n\nMilitary reality undeniable (surrounded, ports falling, food depleting)\n\nJuan's demonstrated honor throughout campaign (kept terms at every surrender)\n\nRespectful, dignified approach (no humiliation, Islamic greeting, dismounted vulnerability)\n\nSpectacular show of strength and seriousness (1,000 crusaders, sacred relics)\n\nTiming favors negotiation (offering terms before starvation critical)\n\nPopulation pressure mounting (civilians calculating food timeline)\n\nGarrison morale already shifted defensive per Chapter 37\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\n\nSultan's pride (ending 700 years of Islamic Al-Andalus)\n\nReligious dimension (pressure from imams, religious significance)\n\nHostage system complications (negotiating surrender undermines his control)\n\nNoble pressure to continue resistance\n\nFear of unknown terms (throne? exile? conversion?)\n\nHuman psychology (surrender is immediate humiliation, starvation is months away)\n\nPotential hardliner garrison commanders who might refuse Sultan's decision\n\n\nD100 TABLE - SULTAN YUSUF IV'S RESPONSE:\n\n\n1-15: Outright Rejection - Gates remain closed, no response or insulting dismissal\n16-30: Defiant Refusal - Formal rejection speech from walls, rallying cry to city\n31-45: Evasive Delay - Request for time to consider, sending low-ranking official to stall\n46-60: Cautious Opening - Sends senior envoy to discuss preliminaries (not Sultan himself)\n61-75: Serious Negotiation - High-ranking delegation with authority to discuss real terms\n76-85: Respectful Engagement - Sultan sends his closest advisors with clear intent to negotiate\n86-95: Personal Response - Sultan appears on walls himself to engage directly\n96-100: Unprecedented Opening - Sultan rides out personally under truce to negotiate face-to-face\n\n\nRoll when ready."

The Sultan is being cautious, testing the waters. He sends someone with authority but not his inner circle. Someone who can gauge Juan's seriousness and terms without committing the Sultan himself.\n\nGiven the success/failure factors:\n- The military reality and Juan's respectful approach got a response\n- But Sultan's pride and the religious/political pressures prevent him from appearing too eager\n- He's sending someone to explore what's being offered\n- This is a diplomatic probe, not yet serious negotiation\n\nI should:\n1. Show more time passing as they deliberate\n2. Have gates open partially\n3. Send out a senior official (not top-tier like vizier, but respected)\n4. Maybe a garrison commander or senior administrator\n5. Someone who can talk but clearly needs to report back\n6. The tone should be cautious, formal, testing\n\nThis is the opening of negotiations, not the culmination. Juan has gotten his foot in the door, but the real work is still ahead.\n\n\nThirty minutes passed. Forty. The sun began its descent toward the western mountains, casting longer shadows across the plain. You remained in prayer, patient and still, while the city deliberated.\n\n\nFinally, movement on the walls.\n\n\nThe gates opened—not fully, just enough for a small party to emerge. Five men on horseback, carrying a white flag that matched your own. They rode forward slowly, deliberately, stopping twenty yards from your position. The lead rider dismounted.\n\n\nHe was perhaps fifty, gray in his beard, wearing fine but not ornate robes over mail armor. The bearing of a senior officer or administrator, someone accustomed to authority but not the highest circles of power. He approached alone, leaving his escort behind, and stopped a respectful distance away.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he said in careful Castilian, accented but clear. \"I am Qaid Ibrahim al-Farsi, commander of the northern garrison and administrator of the city's defensive preparations. Sultan Yusuf IV has received your... unprecedented approach. He has sent me to understand what terms you propose.\"\n\n\nHis tone was formal, cautious. His eyes took in everything—your white armor, the praying posture you'd held for forty minutes, the thousand warriors arrayed in perfect discipline, the sacred relics. Calculating.\n\n\n\"The Sultan wishes to understand,\" Ibrahim continued carefully, \"what exactly you offer, and what you demand. Before any... further discussions... can be considered, he must know the nature of these negotiations. Are you demanding unconditional surrender? Are you offering terms? What becomes of Granada, of our people, of the Sultan himself?\"\n\n\nHe paused, choosing his next words with visible care. \"I am authorized to hear your proposal and carry it back to the Sultan. He will then decide whether... more substantive discussions... are warranted.\"\n\n\nA diplomatic probe. Not rejection, but not full engagement either. The Sultan was testing the waters, wanting to know what you offered before committing himself to actual negotiations.\n\n\nThe garrison commander waited, his stance betraying nothing, while the walls behind him remained crowded with observers watching this historic moment unfold.\n\n\nWhat do you say to Qaid Ibrahim?"

Sultan must abdicate and leave Granada\n2. 50,000 florins compensation for the Sultan\n3. Garrison and population can leave in peace or stay under Christian rule\n4. No forced conversions, no murder\n5. Christianity becomes the land's religion (mosques to churches, but based on past precedents, private prayer spaces allowed)\n6.

Qaid Ibrahim is insulted and takes the terms as an insult. Let me think about how this would play out realistically.\n\nFrom Ibrahim's perspective, after that roll:\n- Juan is demanding the Sultan leave his homeland forever\n- Offering money as if this is a business transaction, not a kingdom\n- Acting like Granada's 700-year dynasty can be bought off\n- The sum might even feel patronizing - \"here's some gold, now leave\"\n- The comparison to \"protecting family\" might sound hollow when Juan is the one destroying Granada\n- The threat at the end (\"fully prepared to siege and starve\") might sound more prominent than the mercy\n\nWith a roll of 1, Ibrahim would be personally offended, see this as disrespectful, and return to the Sultan recommending rejection. This is a major setback for Juan's diplomatic approach.\n\nI need to:\n1. Show Ibrahim's visible anger/offense\n2. Have him respond with dignity but clear rejection\n3. Make it clear he'll report this negatively to the Sultan\n4. Show the historical moment collapsing\n5. Set up that negotiations have been damaged, not destroyed entirely, but this approach failed\n\nThis is dramatic and painful - Juan's best intentions and generous offer backfiring due to how it landed.\n\n\nQaid Ibrahim's face darkened. For the first time, emotion broke through his careful neutrality—and it was anger.\n\n\n\"Fifty thousand florins,\" he said, his voice tight with barely controlled fury. \"You offer the Sultan of Granada, descendant of seven centuries of Nasrid rule, money to abandon his kingdom? To leave the land his ancestors defended for generations? To walk away from the Alhambra like... like a merchant selling property?\"\n\n\nHe took a step forward, his bearing rigid with offense. \"You speak of honor, Your Majesty, but you treat this as a transaction. You compare our Sultan to yourself, as if his choice to defend his people is the same as your choice to invade them. You invoke Allah's name while demanding we surrender everything our faith has held sacred in Al-Andalus for seven hundred years.\"\n\n\nHis voice rose slightly, carrying to the walls where hundreds watched. \"And then—then—you remind us that you are 'fully prepared to siege and starve the city.' You speak of your wife's prayers and mercy, and in the same breath threaten to starve fifty thousand souls. This is your mercy? This is your honor?\"\n\n\nIbrahim's hand trembled slightly at his side. \"You say the Sultan will be 'sultan no more.' That he must leave Granada entirely. Not retire to estates within Castile, not maintain some dignity of position, but leave—like a criminal fleeing justice. And you think gold makes this honorable?\"\n\n\nHe spat the word.\n\n\n\"I will carry your terms to Sultan Yusuf IV, as my duty demands. I will tell him that the King of Castile offers him gold to abandon his throne, his city, his people, and his ancestors' legacy. I will tell him that you speak of preventing suffering while promising starvation if we refuse.\"\n\n\nIbrahim stepped back, his contempt barely masked. \"The Sultan will give his answer in his own time. But know this, Your Majesty: there are things that cannot be bought. There are choices that honor demands, regardless of military reality. Granada has stood for seven centuries. If it must fall, it will fall with dignity—not sold for Castilian gold.\"\n\n\nHe turned sharply, mounting his horse with military precision. The five riders wheeled and galloped back toward the gates without another word. The gates opened just enough to admit them, then slammed shut with echoing finality.\n\n\nOn the walls, the crowd of observers erupted into shouts—whether of approval for Ibrahim's defiance or dismay at failed negotiations, impossible to tell at this distance. But the green Nasrid banners stirred more vigorously now, as if energized by renewed determination.\n\n\nÃlvaro rode forward quietly to your side. \"Your Majesty,\" he said softly, \"we should withdraw.\"\n\n\nBehind you, the thousand crusaders and knights remained disciplined, but you could feel the shift in energy. The spectacular gesture, the forty minutes of prayer, the generous offer—all of it had somehow landed as insult rather than mercy.\n\n\nThe sun was sinking toward the mountains. The gates of Granada remained closed.\n\n\nWhat do you do?"

This is interesting because:\n\n1. The envoy (Qaid Ibrahim) was insulted and angry (rolled 1)\n2. But the Sultan himself might have a different perspective\n3. The Sultan knows the military mathematics better than anyone\n4. He's under different pressures - nobles, religious leaders, family, population\n\nLet me think about success and failure factors for the Sultan's actual decision:\n\n**SUCCESS FACTORS:**\n- Military reality is undeniable (surrounded, food running out, ports falling)\n- 50,000 florins is genuinely an enormous sum (life of luxury anywhere)\n- Juan has proven he keeps his word at every previous surrender\n- Population pressure mounting as food depletes\n- No realistic hope of relief or victory\n- Continuing means watching city starve over months\n- Terms allow him to live, keep wealth, avoid execution\n- Some nobles may privately counsel acceptance\n- Previous sultans have gone into exile when defeated\n\n**FAILURE FACTORS:**\n- Qaid Ibrahim's furious reaction may influence him\n- Pride and dynasty (700 years of Nasrid rule ending)\n- Religious pressure (imams calling it betrayal of Islam)\n- Noble pressure (some may see it as cowardice)\n- His own sense of honor (going down fighting vs accepting money)\n- Fear of being seen as selling out for gold\n- Political rivals could use this against him\n- The hostage system he built his power on becomes meaningless if he surrenders\n- Personal legacy (does he want to be \"the sultan who sold Granada\"?)\n\nThe Sultan is probably more pragmatic than his hot-headed garrison commander, but he's also under enormous pressure. And the way the offer was received by Ibrahim (with fury and insult) will definitely get back to him and color the court's discussion.\n\nLet me draft a realistic table:\n\n1-20: Outright rejection with defiance\n21-40: Formal rejection, prepares for siege\n\n\n41-60: Internal debate emerges, with advisors presenting conflicting arguments. The Sultan hesitates, seeking time to assess the full implications of surrender. Diplomatic channels remain open, but no immediate decision is made.\n\nThe roll suggests a complex internal struggle. Political calculations compete with emotional responses, creating a tense deliberative atmosphere where survival and honor clash. Delay becomes a strategic tool, allowing the Sultan to gauge potential support or opposition to potential surrender.\n\n\nYou returned to camp in silence. The formation dissolved back into the siege lines, crusaders and knights returning to their positions. The white banner was carefully furled. Your armor removed, piece by piece, and stored away.\n\n\nThe evening passed quietly. Sentries reported no unusual activity from the city—no sorties, no signals, just the normal watch rotations on the walls. Granada waited. You waited.\n\n\n\nBefore I roll for Sultan Yusuf IV's actual response, let me assess the factors influencing his decision:\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\n\nMilitary mathematics undeniable (ports falling, food depleting, no relief possible)\n\n50,000 florins genuinely extraordinary (could live in luxury in Morocco, Egypt, or Ottoman lands)\n\nJuan's proven track record (honored every surrender for 18 months)\n\nPopulation pressure mounting (citizens calculating food timeline)\n\nAlternative is watching city starve for months\n\nSome pragmatic nobles/advisors likely counsel acceptance privately\n\nHistorical precedent (defeated Muslim rulers have gone into exile before)\n\nTerms allow him to live, maintain wealth, avoid execution/imprisonment\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\n\nQaid Ibrahim returned furious, calling terms insulting\n\nIbrahim's report will poison court atmosphere\n\nPride and legacy (ending 700 years of Nasrid dynasty)\n\nReligious pressure (imams declaring surrender betrayal of Islam)\n\nHardliner nobles calling it cowardice\n\nBeing remembered as \"the sultan who sold Granada for gold\"\n\nHostage system he built undermines itself if he surrenders\n\nCourt faction dynamics (rivals may use acceptance against him)\n\nPersonal honor vs pragmatism conflict\n\nThe offer itself framed as \"transaction\" rather than honorable terms\n\n\nD100 TABLE - SULTAN YUSUF IV'S ACTUAL DECISION:\n\n\n1-15: Furious Rejection - Sends formal defiant response, rallies city for total resistance\n16-30: Dignified Refusal - Polite but firm rejection, prepared to fight to the end\n31-45: Silent Defiance - No response at all, lets Ibrahim's reaction stand as answer\n46-60: Prolonged Deliberation - Internal debates rage for days/weeks, no decision yet\n61-70: Cautious Counter-Offer - Sends different envoy with modified terms/requests\n71-80: Pragmatic Consideration - Privately inclined to accept but needs better framing\n81-90: Split Decision - Sultan wants to accept, but court/nobles block him\n91-97: Reluctant Acceptance - Agrees to terms despite internal opposition\n98-100: Pragmatic Surrender - Accepts quickly, recognizing inevitable mathematics\n\n\nRoll when ready."

The Sultan makes no response at all, letting Ibrahim's angry reaction stand as the answer.\n\nThis is a middle result - not outright furious rejection, but not engagement either. The Sultan is essentially choosing to ignore the offer completely. This creates an interesting narrative situation where Juan's dramatic gesture has been met with... nothing. Silence.\n\nI should narrate:\n1. Days passing with no response\n2. The camp settling back into siege routine\n3. Reports from the Master of Calatrava about Motril falling\n4. The strategic situation continuing to deteriorate for Granada\n5. The psychological impact of silence - is it weakness? Pride? Internal conflict?\n6. Advisors commenting on what the silence means\n7. The blockade tightening as ports fall\n\nThis sets up a situation where Juan must decide whether to:\n- Wait longer\n- Send another message\n- Proceed with tightening the siege\n- Take more aggressive action\n\nThe silence is actually quite realistic for this roll - the Sultan is trapped between the mathematical reality and his inability to accept the terms as framed, so he does nothing.\n\n\nSeptember 3, 1432 - Morning\n\n\nNo response came from Granada.\n\n\nThe sunrise revealed the same closed gates, the same green banners on the walls, the same garrison rotations. As if your approach had never happened. As if a thousand crusaders had not stood before the city. As if the offer had never been made.\n\n\nÃlvaro joined you at the command platform. \"Nothing overnight. No messengers, no signals, no communication whatsoever.\" He paused. \"They're simply... ignoring it.\"\n\n\n\nSeptember 4, 1432\n\n\nStill nothing. The garrison continued their routines with professional discipline. Sentries on the walls, periodic patrols, the city functioning as if under normal siege conditions. Your cavalry formations reported no change in Granada's behavior—no increased sorties, no signs of internal turmoil, nothing to indicate your offer had any effect at all.\n\n\nDon Fadrique reported: \"It's as if it didn't happen. They've returned to exactly the posture they held before.\"\n\n\n\nSeptember 5, 1432\n\n\nWord arrived from the Master of Calatrava. Motril had surrendered that morning. The breach had been widened over three days of bombardment, and the garrison—seeing the inevitable—had negotiated terms. Safe conduct granted. The port was now in Castilian hands.\n\n\n\"Salobreña is his next target,\" Ãlvaro noted, reading the dispatch. \"He expects to begin siege operations within the week. By mid-September, every coastal access point will be sealed.\"\n\n\nFrom your command platform, you watched Granada through the afternoon light. Smoke rose from cooking fires. Life continued behind those walls. Fifty thousand people going about their lives while the noose tightened incrementally.\n\n\n\nSeptember 6, 1432 - Evening\n\n\nStill no response. Four days since your approach.\n\n\nMartÃ­n joined you as you reviewed casualty reports—mercifully light, the fortified positions and patient approach keeping losses minimal. \"Your Majesty,\" he said quietly, \"the silence is a response in itself. Sultan Yusuf cannot accept the terms as you framed them—the pride, the legacy, the court pressure. But he also cannot reject them outright, because the mathematics are undeniable.\"\n\n\nHe gestured toward the city. \"So he does nothing. He lets Qaid Ibrahim's anger stand as the answer while he... waits. Hoping perhaps that something changes. That Moroccan aid arrives. That winter storms disrupt your supply lines. That something shifts the equation.\"\n\n\nÃlvaro shook his head. \"But nothing will shift. The ports are falling. Food depletes daily. Every week that passes weakens his position.\"\n\n\n\"Yes,\" MartÃ­n agreed. \"Which means he's trapped between impossible choices, so he makes no choice at all. This could last weeks, even months—him sitting in the Alhambra, watching food stores diminish, unable to surrender and unable to fight.\"\n\n\n\nSeptember 7, 1432 - Morning\n\n\nThe fifth day of silence. Your camp had settled back into its routine completely—fortifications maintained, patrols continuing, the elevated crossbow platforms watching the walls, large cavalry formations maintaining visible presence. The siege proceeding exactly as it had before your approach.\n\n\nReports came in from Infante Juan's southern operations: two more villages subdued, another watchtower taken. Methodical progress, closing the secondary supply routes as ordered.\n\n\nThe mathematical inevitability continued its work. Granada's food stores depleting. Salobreña days from siege. The blockade tightening.\n\n\nBut from the Sultan? Nothing. The gates remained closed. The green banners flew. Fifty thousand people behind walls that offered no response to the offer that could have ended their ordeal.\n\n\nÃlvaro stood beside you, looking out at the city. \"Your Majesty, what are your orders? Do we continue as we have been? Send another message? Take more aggressive action?\"\n\n\nThe campaign that you'd hoped might end with negotiation instead continued in silence—neither acceptance nor rejection, just the slow, grinding pressure of time and mathematics doing their inevitable work.\n\n\nWhat do you do?"

They're asking about crop planting - a very practical question about Granada's food situation.\n\nLet me think about the timeline:\n- Current date: September 7, 1432\n- Medieval Iberian agricultural calendar:\n  - Wheat and barley typically planted in October-November (fall planting for spring harvest)\n  - Some crops planted in early spring (March-April) for summer harvest\n  - September is actually a transitional period - too late for summer crops, too early for fall planting\n\nGranada's situation:\n- The vega (agricultural plain) is outside the city walls\n- Castilian forces have been burning crops and controlling territory since the campaign started\n- Granada city itself cannot grow food within its walls in significant quantities\n- They would need access to the surrounding countryside to plant anything\n\nThis is a great strategic question - if they can't plant fall crops (wheat/barley), then even if they somehow survived this winter, they'd have no harvest next spring/summer. The city would be mathematically doomed even without a perfect blockade.\n\nLet me assemble the war council and have them discuss this.\n\n\nThe war council assembled within the hour. The senior commanders gathered around the map table in your command tent—Ãlvaro de Luna, Don Fadrique Enríquez, the Master of Santiago, Master of Alcántara, Infante Enrique, and Commander Martín.\n\n\n\"They've given no response,\" you stated flatly. \"We continue the starvation strategy. But I need to understand the agricultural timeline. Have they already planted crops for next year?\"\n\n\nMartín stepped forward immediately, his knowledge of Granada's systems invaluable. \"Your Majesty, the timing is crucial. September is the transition month. The summer crops—vegetables, fruits, some grains—were harvested in July and August. What they had, they harvested before we fully established the blockade.\"\n\n\nHe pointed to the map, indicating the vega—the great agricultural plain surrounding Granada. \"The fall planting season begins in October, sometimes late September if rains come early. Wheat and barley, the staple grains that would feed the city through next year, must be planted in October and November for spring harvest.\"\n\n\n\"And the vega is entirely outside the city walls,\" Ãlvaro observed.\n\n\n\"Exactly,\" Martín confirmed. \"Granada city itself has some gardens within the walls—courtyards, small plots. Perhaps enough to supplement food for a few thousand people, but nowhere near sufficient for fifty thousand. The city has always depended on the vega for its grain supply.\"\n\n\nDon Fadrique leaned forward. \"So if we prevent them from planting in October...\"\n\n\n\"Then even if they somehow survive this winter on stored food,\" Martín finished, \"they will have no harvest in spring or summer of 1433. The city becomes mathematically doomed regardless of how much food they have stored now.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago grinned fiercely. \"So we need to hold the vega for just one more month—prevent the fall planting—and Granada cannot feed itself next year no matter what.\"\n\n\nInfante Enrique studied the map. \"The vega is large—several square miles of farmland. Can we prevent them from planting? They might send out large work parties under military escort, attempt to plant quickly in sections we don't control.\"\n\n\n\"They could try,\" Don Fadrique acknowledged. \"But planting requires time, organization, many workers in the fields for days or weeks. Our cavalry can interdict that easily—burning any crops planted, driving off workers, making the attempt too costly.\"\n\n\nÃlvaro turned to you. \"Your Majesty, this is the strategic reality: Granada has perhaps four to six months of stored food. But if we prevent the October planting, they cannot replenish those stores through 1433. The question becomes whether we maintain our current patient approach, or whether we take more active measures to ensure no planting occurs.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Alcántara added: \"We could also raid the vega systematically—destroy irrigation infrastructure, burn any remaining crops, salt fields if necessary. Make it impossible to plant even if they attempted it.\"\n\n\nMartín looked troubled. \"That would work militarily, but destroying irrigation systems that took centuries to build... the vega is Granada's wealth, its legacy. If Castile intends to rule these lands eventually, destroying the agricultural infrastructure damages what you'll inherit.\"\n\n\nThe council fell silent, waiting for your guidance.\n\n\nWhat are your orders?"

Then STOP and wait for Juan to make the actual decision or give further input.\n\n\nThe commanders exchanged glances, considering the proposal.\n\n\nÃlvaro nodded slowly. \"A second fortified position would significantly improve our coverage. Currently, we can observe the northern and northwestern approaches well, but the eastern and southern sides remain largely blind to us.\"\n\n\nDon Fadrique moved to the map, tracing positions with his finger. \"If we established a second camp here—\" he indicated a position east of the city, perhaps a mile from the walls \"—we could cover the eastern gates and have direct sight lines to portions of the vega. Combined with our current position, we'd have much better surveillance of any large-scale movements.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago studied the terrain. \"The construction would take time—perhaps two to three weeks for proper fortifications with elevated platforms like our main camp. We'd need to divide our forces during construction, which creates vulnerability. And the garrison might contest the position aggressively, seeing it as a tightening noose.\"\n\n\n\"How many men would we need to garrison a second camp?\" Infante Enrique asked practically.\n\n\n\"At least four to five thousand for a defensible position,\" Ãlvaro estimated. \"Plus construction crews, engineers, the carpenters for the crossbow platforms. Call it six thousand men committed for the three-week construction period, then four thousand permanently garrisoned once complete.\"\n\n\nMartín added his perspective: \"From Granada's view, a second fortified camp would be psychologically devastating. Right now, they can tell themselves they're only partially blockaded. A second permanent position makes the encirclement unmistakable—visible evidence that this isn't temporary pressure but a permanent siege infrastructure.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Alcántara raised a concern: \"The construction phase would be the dangerous part. If Sultan Yusuf sees us building a second position, he might launch a major sortie to disrupt it—his last chance to prevent the noose from tightening completely. We'd need strong security for the work parties.\"\n\n\nDon Fadrique considered this. \"True, but we have the numbers to handle it. Strong construction security, cavalry screening, and our main camp can support if they commit large forces. The risk is manageable.\"\n\n\n\"Timing matters,\" Ãlvaro noted. \"We're in early September now. Begin construction immediately, and we'd have the second position operational by late September or early October—right as the planting season begins. Perfect timing to interdict any attempt to work the vega.\"\n\n\nThe council waited, having laid out the tactical considerations, logistical requirements, and strategic implications of your proposal."

This is the endgame, the culmination of eighteen months.\"\n\n\nDon Fadrique frowned thoughtfully. \"Six thousand troops is sufficient for construction security, especially with cavalry screening.

When they commit, we'll crush them between us.\" He placed his fist over his heart. \"You have my word.\"\n\n\nThe war council dissolved into immediate action. Commanders dispersed to organize their contingents. Within an hour, the camp buzzed with purposeful activity—troops being selected, supplies assembled, engineers reviewing construction plans, cavalry preparing for screening operations.\n\n\n\nCaptain Rodrigo gathered your personal guard in the command tent. Twenty of your most trusted men, veterans who had traveled with you since the beginning—some even to Rome itself.\n\n\n\"The next three weeks are the most dangerous of the entire campaign,\" Rodrigo told them bluntly. \"His Majesty will be at the construction site daily, visibly present.

They understood the stakes.\n\n\nYour armor became daily wear—not the ceremonial white plate, but functional harness. Always four guards minimum within arm's reach. Sleeping arrangements relocated to a tent with multiple guards posted. Food tasted by others first. Every precaution that a king under potential threat required.\n\n\n\nSeptember 7, 1432 - Evening\n\n\nAs night fell, you stood on the command platform watching Granada's walls. Tomorrow, the construction would begin. Eight thousand troops would march to the eastern ridge. The crusaders would dig the earthworks that would complete the strangulation of the last Muslim kingdom in Iberia.\n\n\nAnd Sultan Yusuf IV, who had remained silent for five days, would see it happening.\n\n\nBefore I create the response table, let me assess the factors:\n\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (for Sultan taking aggressive action):\n\n\nSecond camp represents final, complete encirclement\n\nJuan personally present = high-value target\n\nFirst 3-5 days most vulnerable before earthworks complete\n\nDivided Castilian forces (8,000 at construction, 13,700 at main camp)\n\nThis is Sultan's last realistic chance to disrupt operations\n\nHonor/religious pressure demands response to visible strangling\n\nPopulation will see him doing NOTHING as noose tightens\n\nGarrison still has ~9,500 troops capable of major sortie\n\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (against Sultan taking action):\n\n\nCastilians still have overwhelming numbers (21,700 total vs 9,500)\n\nSignal system allows rapid reinforcement (15 minutes)\n\nCavalry screening will detect large movements\n\nSultan's recent pattern has been defensive (no sorties in 6+ days)\n\nFailed sortie could shatter garrison morale completely\n\nFood conservation matters—casualties deplete defenders\n\nPrevious sorties (July-August) proved costly\n\nMathematical reality unchanged even if sortie succeeds temporarily\n\nHis five days of silence suggests paralysis/indecision\n\n\nD100 TABLE - SULTAN YUSUF IV'S RESPONSE TO SECOND CAMP CONSTRUCTION:\n\n\n1-20: Continued Paralysis - No response; watches construction in despair\n21-35: Minor Harassment - Small raids (100-200 men) to harass, not seriously contest\n36-50: Calculated Probe - Medium sortie (500-800 men) testing defenses, gathering intelligence\n51-65: Serious Disruption Attempt - Large sortie (1,500-2,000 men) trying to destroy construction\n66-80: Desperate Major Assault - Massive sortie (3,000-4,000 men) attempting to break construction entirely\n81-90: All-Out Gamble - Commits majority of garrison (5,000-6,000 men) in do-or-die attack\n91-97: Assassination/Infiltration Attempt - Elite team targeting Juan personally during construction\n98-100: Simultaneous Operations - Coordinated attacks on both camps plus assassination attempt\n\n\nRoll when ready."

This is actually quite fitting given the Sultan rolled 41 earlier (silent defiance) and has shown a pattern of indecision and paralysis when faced with impossible choices.\n\nI need to narrate:\n1. The construction beginning on September 8\n2. Granada's complete lack of response despite the provocation\n3. The psychological impact of this on both sides\n4. The construction proceeding without opposition\n5. The increasing despair/calculation visible from Granada\n6. The completion or near-completion of the second camp\n7. What this means strategically\n\nThis should be narrated as the anticlimax it is - Juan prepared for battle, the army ready for the hammer-and-anvil, but Granada simply... does nothing. The paralysis continues. It's almost more disturbing than an attack would be.\n\nI should NOT write dialogue or actions for Juan. I need to stop when he needs to respond or decide something.\n\n\nSeptember 8, 1432 - Dawn\n\n\nThe column departed at first light. Eight thousand troops in disciplined formation—four thousand infantry with tools and construction materials, two thousand cavalry screening ahead and on the flanks, two thousand reserves. The two hundred crusaders marched at the center, white crosses brilliant in the morning sun. You rode at their head in functional armor, your personal guard close around you.\n\n\nThe march to the eastern ridge took less than an hour. The position the Master of Alcántara had identified was excellent—elevated ground three-quarters of a mile from Granada's eastern gate, clear sightlines to both the city and large portions of the vega, defensible terrain with good approaches for reinforcement.\n\n\nAs the army deployed, you could see movement on Granada's walls. Figures gathering on the battlements, pointing. Officers conferring urgently. The garrison could see exactly what was happening—eight thousand Castilian troops establishing a second permanent position, the noose visibly tightening.\n\n\nThe first earthworks began. Four thousand men with shovels, picks, and axes. Engineers staking out the perimeter. Timber being prepared for the elevated crossbow platforms. The crusaders working alongside regular troops, everyone contributing to the construction that would complete Granada's encirclement.\n\n\nFrom the walls, Granada watched.\n\n\nAnd did nothing.\n\n\n\nSeptember 8, 1432 - Midday\n\n\nSix hours of construction. The eastern gates of Granada remained closed. No sortie emerged. No cavalry rode out to harass. No arrows flew from the walls at extreme range.\n\n\nCaptain Rodrigo approached, his expression puzzled. \"Your Majesty, our scouts report no unusual activity. Normal garrison rotations. No troops massing at gates. No preparations for sortie that we can detect.\"\n\n\nDon Fadrique, commanding the cavalry screen, confirmed: \"Nothing. They're watching us from the walls, but taking no action whatsoever.\"\n\n\nThe construction continued. Earthen ramparts taking shape. Defensive ditches being dug. The foundation posts for the first crossbow platform going into the ground.\n\n\nGranada watched in silence.\n\n\n\nSeptember 9, 1432\n\n\nThe second day of construction proceeded exactly like the first. Your eight thousand troops worked methodically—ramparts rising, platforms being built, the fortified position taking clear shape. You moved among the workers, visibly present as promised, your white surcoat recognizable even at distance.\n\n\nOn Granada's walls, the observers remained. Officers studying the construction through all daylight hours. But the gates stayed closed.\n\n\nInfante Enrique sent word from the main camp: \"No activity on the northern approaches either. They're not even probing. Just... watching.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago, working alongside the crusaders digging earthworks, shook his head in disbelief. \"I've never seen anything like this. We're building a siege position in plain view, the king himself present, and they do nothing? Not even harassment?\"\n\n\nBy evening, the basic earthwork perimeter was complete—not yet the full fortifications, but already a defensible position. The first elevated platform stood partially constructed, visible against the sky.\n\n\n\nSeptember 10, 1432\n\n\nThe third day. The most vulnerable phase was passing. The earthworks now provided real protection. The construction had momentum and organization. If Granada was going to attack, these first few days had been their window.\n\n\nStill nothing.\n\n\nMartín joined you on the partially completed command platform, looking across at the city walls. \"Your Majesty, this is the paralysis made visible. Sultan Yusuf cannot accept your terms, cannot reject them outright, and now cannot even muster the will to contest this. He's trapped in indecision while we complete the work that makes his position mathematically hopeless.\"\n\n\nThe construction crews were now working with confidence bordering on ease. No longer the tense readiness of the first days, but the rhythm of uncontested labor. Watchtowers rising. More crossbow platforms taking shape. Storage buildings for supplies going up.\n\n\nFrom the walls, Granada continued to watch. You could almost feel the despair radiating from those distant battlements.\n\n\n\nSeptember 11-15, 1432\n\n\nThe construction proceeded without incident through the following week. What had begun as a potentially dangerous operation became merely a large-scale building project. Your guards remained vigilant, but the expected attack never materialized.\n\n\nBy September 15th, the second fortified camp was substantially complete:\n\n\nFull earthwork perimeter with ramparts and ditches\n\nSix elevated crossbow platforms operational\n\nCommand post with clear views of eastern Granada and the vega\n\nSupply depots and barracks for permanent garrison\n\nSignal flag system connecting to main camp\n\nStrong defensive position requiring no further major work\n\n\nYou stood on the completed eastern command platform that afternoon, looking across at Granada's walls. From here, you could see the eastern and southeastern approaches clearly. Combined with the main camp's coverage of the north and northwest, Granada was now under observation from two permanent, fortified positions.\n\n\nThe vega spread below—the great agricultural plain that had fed the city for centuries. Empty of workers. Unplanted. The October planting season approaching, and not a single Granadan farmer visible in the fields.\n\n\nÃlvaro joined you, having ridden over from the main camp. \"They watched us build this entire position. Eight days of construction with you personally present. The Sultan did absolutely nothing.\" His voice carried a mixture of satisfaction and something like pity. \"This isn't resistance anymore, Your Majesty. This is a city waiting to die, unable to fight and unable to surrender.\"\n\n\nFrom Granada's eastern gate, perhaps half a mile away, you could see figures on the walls. Still watching. Always watching. Silent witnesses to their own encirclement.\n\n\nThe green Nasrid banners hung limp in the still September air.\n\n\nWhat are your orders?"

They'll be here in twelve minutes.

Your eight thousand troops were already in defensive positions, earthworks and platforms manned, cavalry forming up for counterattack. The element of surprise they'd needed was gone, detected before they'd even cleared the gates.\n\n\nBut they were coming anyway. Two thousand desperate men against eight thousand prepared defenders, with four thousand more reinforcements minutes away.\n\n\nYour commanders waited for orders.

Men stumbled over the bodies of their comrades.\n\n\nThey were still two hundred yards from the earthworks when the formation began to waver.\n\n\n\"CAVALRY!\" Don Fadrique's voice cut through the dawn. \"FORWARD!\"\n\n\nYour screening cavalry—eight hundred mounted men who had been holding on the flanks—spurred into motion. They swept around the disintegrating Granadan formation like wolves on wounded prey, cutting off retreat angles, riding down men who broke from the formation.\n\n\nThe Granadan sortie tried to reform, tried to press forward, but the mathematics were impossible. Crossbow fire from protected positions. Cavalry charges into exposed flanks. Eight thousand disciplined troops against two thousand caught in open ground without surprise.\n\n\nThe formation broke.\n\n\nIt wasn't a fighting withdrawal—it was a rout. Men threw down weapons and ran for the gates. Others tried to surrender, hands raised, dropping to their knees. The cavalry pursued ruthlessly, cutting down fleeing soldiers, herding others toward your lines as prisoners.\n\n\nThe entire engagement lasted perhaps fifteen minutes. By the time Infante Enrique's four thousand reinforcements crested the western ridge at full march, it was already over. The eastern gate of Granada stood open, bodies scattered across the approach, perhaps three hundred prisoners being rounded up by your troops, and the survivors streaming back into the city in complete disorder.\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago rode up to your position, his sword clean—he hadn't even needed to draw it. \"They broke before reaching our lines, Your Majesty. The crossbows shattered them, the cavalry finished it. I've never seen a sortie collapse so completely.\"\n\n\nCaptain Rodrigo was already receiving reports. \"Preliminary count: eight Castilian casualties—five dead, three wounded. All from long-range arrows fired during their approach. None reached our earthworks.\" He paused, looking toward the carnage. \"Their casualties... at least seven hundred dead or dying on the field. Perhaps another hundred wounded among the prisoners. Another two hundred fled back to the gates.\"\n\n\nÃlvaro rode up from coordinating the prisoner collection. \"It was slaughter, Your Majesty. They were detected too early, attacked prepared positions with no surprise, and paid the full price. This wasn't a battle—it was an execution.\"\n\n\nThrough the rising sun, you could see Granada's eastern gate slamming shut. The bodies of their sortie scattered across the approach like broken dolls. Three hundred prisoners being herded toward your camp, many wounded. The green Nasrid banners on the walls hanging motionless.\n\n\nMartín approached slowly, his expression troubled. \"Those were professional soldiers. Garrison commanders. Men who couldn't bear the paralysis anymore and launched this sortie knowing they'd likely die. And they did die—eight hundred of Granada's best troops, perhaps a tenth of their entire remaining garrison, killed in fifteen minutes of futile desperation.\"\n\n\nThe eastern camp stood untouched. Not a single position had been threatened. The earthworks hadn't even been tested.\n\n\nInfante Enrique's reinforcements were arriving now, four thousand men who had marched at forced pace only to find the battle already over. He rode directly to you, taking in the scene with experienced eyes. \"The hammer wasn't needed. They broke themselves against your fortress.\"\n\n\nThe sun continued to rise over the battlefield. Your commanders waited for orders regarding the prisoners, the bodies, and the strategic implications of Granada's catastrophic sortie.\n\n\nWhat do you command?"

The sortie's complete failure should trigger some kind of response - either toward surrender or toward even deeper despair/radicalization.\n\n\n\"Gather all the wounded,\" you ordered clearly. \"Ours and theirs.

Let Granada see we don't butcher the helpless.\"\n\n\nÃlvaro nodded slowly, understanding. \"Mercy as strategic message. Yes, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nWithin the hour, the wounded Granadans—perhaps eighty men with injuries ranging from crossbow bolts to broken limbs—were loaded onto carts. A white flag went up. Your soldiers approached the eastern gate with the wounded under truce.\n\n\nThe gates opened cautiously. The wounded were accepted in silence, carried inside by their comrades. The gates closed again without a word exchanged.\n\n\n\nInfante Enrique dismounted, his four thousand men catching their breath after the forced march. \"We came ready to be your hammer, Your Majesty, and found you'd already broken the anvil.\" He smiled grimly. \"A good problem to have.\"\n\n\n\"Stay an hour, rest your men, then return to the main camp.

The catastrophic sortie changed nothing about your strategic approach—the two fortified camps maintained their positions, cavalry patrols swept the vega, the noose remained tight.

The planting season came and went with the vega fields remaining empty, unworked.\n\n\nBefore I roll for Granada's response, let me assess the factors:\n\n\nFACTORS FAVORING ACTION:\n\n\nCatastrophic sortie loss (800+ dead, garrison morale devastated)\n\nOctober planting completely missed—1433 harvest now impossible\n\nFood stores now perhaps 2-4 months remaining (critical timeline approaching)\n\nMathematical doom undeniable to everyone\n\nSultan's paralysis/incompetence completely exposed\n\nInternal factions must be desperate\n\nPopulation watching their children's future die\n\nPragmatic elements must recognize hopelessness\n\nHistorical precedent: disasters often trigger political changes\n\n\nFACTORS AGAINST ACTION:\n\n\nMorale shattered by sortie disaster\n\nFear of further catastrophic losses\n\nSultan still technically in control\n\nReligious hardliners may radicalize further\n\nDespair can lead to paralysis, not action\n\nHostage system (if still functioning) prevents challenges\n\nNo clear alternative leader\n\nPride preventing \"surrender after such losses\"\n\nComplete demoralization freezing all initiative\n\n\nD100 TABLE - GRANADA'S RESPONSE (Post-Sortie, October-November 1432):\n\n\n1-20: Deepening Paralysis - Sultan retreats into denial; city descends into despair; no action\n21-35: Religious Radicalization - Hardline imams seize narrative; declare martyrdom over surrender\n36-50: Desperate Second Sortie - Another unauthorized attack from garrison units refusing to wait for starvation\n51-65: Secret Peace Faction - Nobles/merchants send covert envoys without Sultan's knowledge\n66-75: Internal Coup - Pragmatic faction overthrows Sultan to negotiate surrender\n76-85: Sultan Finally Acts - Yusuf sends formal envoys after sortie disaster shocks him into reality\n86-92: Mass Desertion Begins - Garrison soldiers fleeing to Castilian lines in small groups\n93-97: Popular Uprising - Citizens riot demanding surrender; force Sultan's hand\n98-100: Unconditional Surrender - Sultan offers complete capitulation\n\n\nRoll when ready."

After all the failures, tragedy, and paralysis - Granada is offering unconditional surrender. This is an extraordinary, campaign-ending moment. Let me craft this carefully and dramatically.\n\nThe timeline: We're in mid-November 1432. The catastrophic sortie was October 16th. A month has passed. The sortie lost 800+ men for nothing. The October planting season passed with no crops planted. Food stores are now critical (maybe 2-3 months left). The mathematics have become undeniable to everyone.\n\nAn unconditional surrender would likely come through formal envoys, not the Sultan riding out himself (that would be too much even for a 100). But it should be dramatic, official, and represent a complete capitulation.\n\nKey elements to include:\n- The formal approach under white flag\n- High-ranking envoys with clear authority\n- The message of unconditional surrender\n- Acceptance of all terms Juan previously offered\n- The emotional/historical weight of this moment\n- Juan's commanders' reactions\n- The practical next steps\n- But most importantly - STOP before Juan responds, as per the rules\n\nThis is the end of the 782-year Nasrid dynasty. The completion of the Reconquista of Granada. A massive historical moment.\n\n\nNovember 15, 1432 - Morning\n\n\nThe rider came at dawn. A single horseman under a white flag, approaching the eastern camp at a walk. Not a military officer this time, but someone in rich civilian robes—a court official or noble.\n\n\nThe sentries brought him to the command post immediately. You were breaking fast when Captain Rodrigo announced: \"Your Majesty, an envoy from Granada. He requests immediate audience. He says...\" Rodrigo paused, as if not quite believing what he'd been told. \"He says he carries Sultan Yusuf's unconditional surrender.\"\n\n\nThe words hung in the air for a heartbeat.\n\n\nWithin minutes, your senior commanders assembled. The envoy was brought forward—an elderly man, perhaps sixty, wearing the rich robes of high court office. His face was drawn, exhausted, but his bearing maintained dignity despite what he carried.\n\n\nHe bowed deeply. \"Your Majesty, I am Vizier Ahmad ibn Khalil, chief minister of Sultan Yusuf IV of Granada.\" His Castilian was flawless, his voice steady despite the weight of his message. \"I come bearing my lord's formal surrender.\"\n\n\nFrom his robes, he produced a sealed document. The green wax seal of the Nasrid dynasty. He held it out with both hands.\n\n\n\"Sultan Yusuf IV, by the grace of Allah, Lord of Granada and the Alhambra, does hereby surrender unconditionally to His Majesty King Juan II of Castile. All terms previously offered are accepted without modification or negotiation. The Sultan will abdicate his throne, accept the compensation of fifty thousand florins, and depart Granada for exile. The city, the Alhambra, all remaining territories, and all military forces submit to Castilian authority. The garrison will lay down arms. The gates will open at Your Majesty's command.\"\n\n\nThe old vizier's voice nearly broke on the last words, but he maintained composure. \"My lord Sultan asks only that the surrender be conducted with dignity, that the terms Your Majesty offered be honored as stated, and that unnecessary bloodshed be avoided. He is prepared to sign formal articles of capitulation at Your Majesty's convenience.\"\n\n\nHe lowered his head. \"Granada is yours, Your Majesty. The last kingdom of Al-Andalus submits to the Crown of Castile. The Reconquista is complete.\"\n\n\nThe silence in the command tent was absolute.\n\n\nÃlvaro de Luna stared at the sealed document as if it might vanish. The Master of Santiago had tears streaming down his weathered face. Infante Enrique, who had ridden over from the main camp, stood frozen in disbelief. Don Fadrique's hand had gone to his sword hilt reflexively, then fallen away, purposeless.\n\n\nMartín closed his eyes, his lips moving in what might have been prayer—whether Christian or a memory of Muslim, impossible to say.\n\n\nThe vizier remained bowing, holding out the document of surrender. Behind him through the tent opening, Granada's walls were visible in the morning light. The green Nasrid banners still flew, but the city behind them was offering itself to you without condition, without negotiation, without reservation.\n\n\nSeven hundred and eighty-two years of Muslim rule in Granada, ending in this moment. Eighteen months of crusade, countless battles and sieges, nearly two thousand Castilian casualties, finally culminating in this elderly man holding out a sealed document with trembling hands.\n\n\nYour commanders waited. The vizier waited. History waited.\n\n\nWhat do you say?"

This is harsh but logical - Juan offered generous terms, they were rejected/ignored, people died unnecessarily in the sortie, so now the Sultan gets basic dignity but not the financial compensation.\n\nI need to show the vizier's reaction to this. He came expecting unconditional acceptance of the original terms. Now Juan is accepting the surrender but removing the financial compensation. This is still merciful (no executions, dignity maintained, people can choose to stay or leave) but it's a price for the delay and bloodshed.\n\nThe vizier would be:\n- Shocked/dismayed at loss of the 50,000 florins\n- Understanding that this is consequence of Sultan's choices\n- Possibly trying to negotiate or at least understand\n- Needing to know practical details\n\nI should NOT generate Juan's dialogue or actions. I need to stop after the vizier responds and asks questions, waiting for Juan to answer.\n\n\nThe vizier's composure cracked for just a moment—a visible flinch at your words about the fifty thousand florins. He straightened slowly, processing what you'd said.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty is... withdrawing the financial compensation?\" His voice was careful, measured, but you could hear the dismay beneath. \"The Sultan had understood that the offer of fifty thousand florins was part of the terms of unconditional surrender.\"\n\n\nÃlvaro shifted slightly beside you, but said nothing. The other commanders remained silent, letting you handle this.\n\n\nThe vizier continued, choosing his words with visible care: \"Your Majesty speaks of choices the Sultan made. It is true that... there was delay. And the sortie—\" his voice tightened \"—the sortie was unauthorized by the Sultan himself. Garrison commanders acting in desperation, not by his order. Eight hundred of our finest soldiers died in that futility.\"\n\n\nHe paused, then pressed on: \"But Your Majesty, the Sultan is fifty-three years old. He has ruled for thirty years. He has no lands outside Granada, no estates in other kingdoms. Without compensation, he becomes... a penniless exile. Dependent on the charity of foreign courts. Is this the dignity befitting a former sultan?\"\n\n\nHis hands spread slightly, a gesture that was almost pleading despite his attempt at formal composure. \"Your Majesty offered those terms freely before. The Sultan now accepts all Your Majesty demanded—unconditional surrender, abdication, exile, everything. Surely the offer of compensation was part of those terms?\"\n\n\nThe old man was trying, carefully, to argue for restoration of the financial settlement without directly challenging your authority. Behind him, the other commanders watched intently. This was the first real negotiation of the surrender's details.\n\n\nThe vizier waited for your response, his diplomatic skill warring with visible anxiety about his lord's fate."

This implies some compensation, but not the original generous offer.\n\nThis is Juan speaking, so I need to stop here and let the vizier respond to what Juan has said.

But practical questions remained—questions about how this exile would actually function, what minimal support would be provided, where the former ruler of Granada would spend his remaining years.\n\n\nBehind the vizier, through the tent opening, Granada's walls stood waiting. Inside those walls, Sultan Yusuf IV awaited his minister's return with news of his fate.\n\n\nThe vizier's hands were no longer trembling. He had accepted the reality.

This is actually a reasonable middle ground - Juan is maintaining his position that the rejected terms can't be reclaimed, but offering something practical in exchange for formal renunciation of claims. This is historically sensible (preventing future pretenders) and shows Juan being practical rather than vindictive.\n\nThe vizier would likely see this as workable and better than nothing.

A practical path forward where moments ago there had seemed only harshness.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty offers wisdom,\" he said carefully. \"A formal renunciation of all claims, binding upon the Sultan and his descendants in perpetuity, in exchange for resources sufficient to establish himself with dignity in exile. This is... reasonable. More than reasonable, given the circumstances.\"\n\n\nHe paused, then asked directly: \"When Your Majesty speaks of 'a modest sum'—may I understand the scale we discuss?

Álvaro would know estate values and what would be appropriate. Let me think about 15th century economics:\n\n- 50,000 florins was described as extraordinary, 4-5 years of Granada's entire treasury revenue\n- That was meant to be truly generous, allowing him to \"live in abundance\"\n- A \"modest sum\" should be much less but still dignified\n\nFor context:\n- A knight's annual income might be 100-300 florins\n- A small estate might cost 2,000-5,000 florins to purchase\n- Living expenses for a small noble household might be 500-1,000 florins per year\n- For the Sultan with family, he'd need more than a single knight but much less than a kingdom\n\nA reasonable \"modest but dignified\" sum might be:\n- 5,000-10,000 florins: Enough to purchase a modest estate somewhere and maintain a small household for years\n- This is 1/5 to 1/10 of the original offer\n- Shows the consequence of rejecting the original terms\n- But still allows genuine dignity and sustainability\n\nÁlvaro would probably suggest something in this range and explain the reasoning.\n\n\nÁlvaro stepped closer, lowering his voice for a semi-private consultation while the vizier waited respectfully at a distance.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, it depends on location and what exactly you mean by 'small estate,'\" Álvaro said quietly. \"In Morocco or Egypt, where he'd likely go, a modest property with agricultural land—enough to generate income and maintain a small household—would cost perhaps two to three thousand florins to purchase. More if he wants something near a major city.\"\n\n\nHe continued his calculation: \"For ongoing expenses: a former sultan maintaining minimal dignity would need perhaps five hundred to eight hundred florins annually. Household staff, basic court, supporting his immediate family. Nothing lavish, but not poverty either.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro paused, doing mental arithmetic. \"If Your Majesty wants him established with property and resources to live comfortably for years without needing to beg from foreign courts... I'd suggest eight to ten thousand florins total. Enough to purchase an estate, establish himself, and maintain a small household for a decade or more if he's prudent.\"\n\n\nHe met your eyes. \"It's one-fifth of what you originally offered. A clear consequence for his rejection and the months of continued war. But it's also genuine dignity—he won't be a penniless refugee. He can live quietly as a minor noble in exile, which seems to fit Your Majesty's intent.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago, overhearing, nodded agreement. \"Ten thousand florins is substantial but not extravagant. It says: 'I keep my word about dignity, but you paid a price for rejecting mercy when it was offered freely.'\"\n\n\nÁlvaro waited for your decision on the amount."

I need to have the vizier respond to what Juan has said, answer his question about when the garrison can move out, and handle the practical logistics.\n\nThe vizier would likely:\n1. Confirm the timeline (garrison surrender today/tomorrow)\n2. Appreciate the urgency but also the patience for the Sultan's departure\n3. Answer the question about when garrison can move out\n4. Respond to the offer of written terms\n5. Possibly ask a few clarifying questions about the surrender ceremony itself\n\nThis is going well - Juan is being firm but fair, withdrawing the 50,000 but providing 10,000, allowing dignity, being practical about timing.\n\n\nThe vizier nodded with visible relief at your pragmatic approach. \"Your Majesty's wisdom serves both kingdoms. Yes—garrison surrender immediately, securing the city and allowing normal life to resume, while the Sultan's personal departure proceeds at a more measured pace. This is humane and practical.\"\n\n\nHe considered your question. \"The garrison can march out this afternoon if Your Majesty wishes, though tomorrow morning might allow more orderly preparation—ensuring all units are informed, weapons properly collected, the ceremony conducted with dignity rather than chaos. Let us say tomorrow at dawn? The entire garrison assembled outside the main gate to formally lay down arms before Your Majesty?\"\n\n\n\"As for written terms—yes, the Sultan would appreciate Your Majesty's offer in writing. It provides clarity for both sides and ensures no misunderstanding. If Your Majesty's scribes can prepare the document, I will carry it to the Sultan for his signature on the renunciation.\"\n\n\nThe vizier paused, then asked: \"For the surrender ceremony itself—does Your Majesty wish the Sultan to be present when the garrison lays down arms? Or would it be acceptable for him to remain in the Alhambra during the military surrender, joining only later for the formal signing of articles and transfer of authority?\"\n\n\nHe added carefully: \"Some former rulers have attended their garrison's surrender as a matter of honor. Others have found it... too painful. The Sultan has not yet decided. Your Majesty's preference would guide him.\"\n\n\nThe old diplomat waited, the final logistics of this historic moment being worked out between you."

He'll likely meet Juan later in a more private setting as mentioned.\n\nThis is the climactic moment of the entire campaign. I should give it appropriate weight and detail while following the user's instructions.\n\n\nNovember 16, 1432 - Dawn\n\n\nThe army assembled in the gray pre-dawn light. Not in defensive positions this time, but in formal ranks—twenty thousand men in parade formation stretching across the plain before Granada's main gate. The white crusade banner at the center, held by Fray Hernando and the Guardian Company. The reliquaries gleaming. The Military Orders arrayed in their colors—Santiago's black crosses, Calatrava's red, Alcántara's green.\n\n\nYou sat your horse at the formation's center, wearing your white Milanese armor, your father's sword at your side. Beside you: the Infantes Juan and Enrique, the Masters of the three Military Orders, Don Fadrique Enríquez, Don Álvaro de Luna, the senior commanders who had fought this campaign from its beginning eighteen months ago.\n\n\nBehind the formation: wagons prepared to collect weapons. Engineers ready to enter the city. Scribes with documents. Everything organized with military precision, but the atmosphere was ceremony, not combat.\n\n\nThe sun broke over the eastern mountains.\n\n\nGranada's main gate opened.\n\n\n\nThey came out in formation—what remained of the garrison. Perhaps eight thousand men after the catastrophic sortie and casualties across the campaign. Professional soldiers who had defended their city for months, now marching out to surrender. They maintained discipline, keeping ranks, their bearing proud despite what came next.\n\n\nBut Sultan Yusuf IV was not among them.\n\n\nAt the head of the column rode garrison commanders—older officers in fine armor, their faces set in expressions of controlled grief. Behind them: infantry units, cavalry squadrons, the remnants of what had been one of Iberia's finest military forces.\n\n\nThey halted fifty yards from your formation.\n\n\nThe lead commander—a grizzled man perhaps sixty years old—dismounted and walked forward alone. He stopped ten paces away and bowed deeply.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" his voice carried clearly in the dawn silence. \"I am Qaid Muhammad al-Rashid, senior commander of Granada's garrison. Sultan Yusuf IV sends his respects and his... regrets that he cannot attend this moment personally. The weight of what transpires here is too heavy for him to bear in public view.\"\n\n\nThe old commander's voice was steady, but his hands trembled slightly. \"We come to lay down our arms as agreed. Granada's military forces submit to Your Majesty's authority. The Reconquista is complete.\"\n\n\nHe drew his sword—a beautiful curved blade that had clearly seen years of service—and laid it on the ground before you. Then he removed his helmet and placed it beside the sword.\n\n\nBehind him, eight thousand men began to do the same.\n\n\n\nThe disarmament took two hours. Your soldiers moved through the surrendered ranks methodically, collecting weapons and armor. Swords, spears, bows, shields, mail haubergs, helmets—everything that made them a military force. The Granadan soldiers stood in ordered lines as they were stripped of their martial identity, many with tears streaming down weathered faces.\n\n\nThe weapons piled into wagons. Thousands of swords. Hundreds of suits of armor. The accumulated military equipment of Granada's final garrison, now property of the Crown of Castile.\n\n\nNo incidents. No resistance. The garrison submitted with disciplined professionalism, soldiers who understood they had been defeated and were accepting the consequences with whatever dignity remained to them.\n\n\nBy mid-morning, it was complete. Eight thousand disarmed men standing in formation, awaiting permission to disperse. The wagons groaning under the weight of collected weapons.\n\n\nQaid Muhammad approached again, now wearing only a simple tunic, his armor and sword taken with the rest. \"It is done, Your Majesty. What are your orders for my men?\"\n\n\n\nThe entry into Granada began at noon.\n\n\nThe white crusade banner led the way, carried by Fray Hernando with the Guardian Company surrounding the sacred relics. You rode immediately behind in your white armor, flanked by the Infantes and the Masters of the Military Orders. Perhaps two hundred men total—a symbolic delegation, not a conquering horde.\n\n\nThe main gate stood open. No resistance. No crowds. Just empty streets as your small force rode into the city that had resisted Christendom for nearly eight centuries.\n\n\nCitizens watched from windows and doorways—thousands of faces, Muslim and Jewish, watching the white banner pass. Silent. Some weeping. Some stoic. All witnessing the end of their world.\n\n\nYour soldiers moved through the city with disciplined restraint. No looting. No violence. Teams heading directly to the gates and key positions to raise Castilian banners. Engineers securing the walls. Small garrison units taking up positions at critical points.\n\n\nThe ride through Granada's streets took an hour, winding upward toward the Alhambra on its height. The red fortress loomed larger as you climbed—the seat of Nasrid power, the symbol of Muslim Granada, now waiting to receive its new master.\n\n\nAt the Alhambra's gates: Vizier Ahmad ibn Khalil, waiting with a small delegation of court officials. No soldiers. No weapons. Just elderly men in court robes, representing a dynasty that ended today.\n\n\nThe vizier bowed deeply as you approached. \"Your Majesty. The Alhambra awaits. Sultan Yusuf...\" he paused, choosing words carefully, \"...Sultan Yusuf requests the honor of receiving Your Majesty privately in the Hall of Ambassadors to formally surrender his authority and sign the renunciation of claims.\"\n\n\nBehind the vizier, through the Alhambra's ornate gates, you could see the palace's famed courtyards and fountains. The heart of Granada. Yours now.\n\n\nBut first, the final formality: meeting the defeated sultan face to face.\n\n\nThe vizier waited for your response."

I should make it feel weighty and significant, but not over-dramatize. The Sultan is a defeated man accepting reality, not a villain. He's been paralyzed by impossible choices and now faces the final humiliation of surrendering his kingdom in person.\n\n\nThe vizier took the sword with both hands, his eyes widening as he recognized it. \"Qaid Muhammad's blade. He carried this for thirty years.\" His voice caught. \"That Your Majesty would return it... this is a gesture that will be remembered, Your Majesty.

Delicate arches framed courtyards where fountains played. Arabic calligraphy flowed across walls in elegant script. The Court of the Lions with its famous fountain stood empty, water still flowing as it had for generations.\n\n\nThe Hall of Ambassadors rose before you—the throne room of the Nasrid sultans. The vizier opened the doors.\n\n\nThe chamber was breathtaking. A massive domed ceiling soared overhead, covered in intricate muqarnas work that seemed to defy gravity. Light filtered through ornate windows. The walls bore Quranic verses in flowing Arabic: \"There is no conqueror but God.\"\n\n\nAt the far end, on a raised dais beneath the dome, stood a solitary figure.\n\n\nSultan Yusuf IV was fifty-three but looked older. His beard was mostly gray, his face lined with the weight of recent months. He wore rich robes—maintaining the dignity of his station—but his shoulders sagged with defeat. No crown. No weapons. Just a man who had ruled for thirty years and now watched his kingdom end.\n\n\nBehind him, the windows overlooked Granada—the city he was surrendering spread out below in the afternoon light.\n\n\nThe Sultan's eyes met yours as you entered. There was no defiance in them. No anger. Just profound weariness and resignation. He had made his choice—unconditional surrender—and now faced its consequences.\n\n\nThe vizier closed the doors behind your small delegation, leaving you, the Sultan, and your honor guard in the Hall of Ambassadors. The chamber fell silent except for the distant sound of fountains in the courtyards beyond.\n\n\nSultan Yusuf IV stood waiting beneath the ornate dome, beneath the words declaring \"There is no conqueror but God,\" waiting to formally surrender the last Muslim kingdom in Al-Andalus to the Christian king before him."

The optimal planting window for wheat and barley was October through early November.\"\n\n\nVizier Ahmad nodded, adding his local expertise: \"The vega traditionally plants in October. By now, in normal years, the fields would already be planted and the winter rains nurturing the crops for spring harvest.\"\n\n\n\"But is it completely too late?\" you pressed.\n\n\nMartín and the vizier exchanged glances. \"Not completely,\" Martín said carefully. \"Late planting is risky - the crops may not establish strong enough roots before winter, yields will be reduced, and there's higher risk of failure. But if we plant immediately - within the next week or two - and if the winter rains are favorable, we could salvage perhaps forty to sixty percent of a normal harvest.\"\n\n\n\"Better than nothing,\" Álvaro observed. \"Better than total starvation next summer.\"\n\n\nThe vizier spoke up: \"Your Majesty, there is also the matter of the workers themselves. The vega has always been worked by Muslim farmers who know the land, the irrigation systems, the techniques. They are still here, but they are... uncertain. Uncertain if they are permitted to work their fields under Christian rule. Uncertain if the harvest will be taken from them. Uncertain about everything.\"\n\n\nHe gestured toward the windows overlooking the city. \"If Your Majesty wants crops planted immediately, you must give those farmers certainty. Tell them they can work the land. Tell them how taxation will function. Tell them they won't be enslaved or expelled. Without that certainty, they will not plant, even if given permission.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago frowned. \"We've just conquered the city. The population needs to understand they're under Christian rule now. But if we want them to feed themselves next year...\"\n\n\n\"They need immediate, clear direction,\" Álvaro finished. \"Agricultural policy, taxation policy, religious policy - all announced quickly so normal life can resume.\"\n\n\nYour commanders waited. The throne beneath you still felt strange, foreign. But the city beyond these walls needed decisions, and needed them now.\n\n\nWhat are your orders regarding the planting and the farmers?"

An emergency. \nWe need to make it clear that we first have to secure our food for the coming years and not starve basically. \nI understand that they have questions about religion. The grand mosque will be converted to a church or cathedral. But are there other mosques that can serve? While we are in crisis they can continue service as normal. No-one will be forced to convert. I am also temporarily suspending all taxes in Grenada city and area untill the crisis is over. So we will not be taking any harvest, we need every ounce of grain to feed the people. \nThey will notice that there is a different flag waving; they have a new christian king. The war is over and their sultan has officially surrendered and has honourably given all titles to me, the king of Castille. \nAlso communicate that all trades in food will not be taxed for as long as the food crisis lasts. This will hopefully encourage traders to transport more food to Grenada."

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated pragmatic crisis response, deferring NPC reactions.\n\nThe player is making practical, crisis-focused decisions. He's:\n1. Declaring a food emergency\n2. Converting the grand mosque but allowing other mosques to continue temporarily\n3. Suspending all taxes until food crisis is resolved\n4. Not taking any harvest - letting people keep it all\n5. Exempting food trade from taxation to encourage imports\n\nThese are pragmatic, generous policies focused on stabilizing the situation and preventing starvation. The commanders and vizier would respond to this.\n\nI should NOT generate Juan's dialogue or actions. I should have the NPCs respond to what he just said, then stop to let him make the next decision.\n\n\nÁlvaro listened intently, then nodded with approval. \"Clear, practical, focused on the immediate crisis. This will work, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nVizier Ahmad's expression shifted from uncertainty to something like hope. \"Your Majesty understands what the people need to hear. Food security first. Religious questions can wait. This approach will reassure them.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago looked less comfortable. \"Allowing mosques to continue operating, even temporarily...\" He paused, then acknowledged reality. \"But if the alternative is the city starving because farmers won't plant, I understand the necessity. The grand mosque becomes a cathedral - that fulfills the crusade's spiritual requirement. The rest can wait.\"\n\n\nDon Fadrique was already thinking logistics. \"Tax exemption on food imports will draw merchants immediately. They'll see profit opportunity. Grain from Castile, from Aragon, from overseas - it will flow toward Granada if there's no tax burden.\"\n\n\nMartín added: \"Suspending all taxes and letting farmers keep their entire harvest - this removes every practical barrier to planting immediately. They'll work knowing the food is theirs, not taken by the crown.\"\n\n\nThe vizier spoke carefully: \"Your Majesty, there are seventeen smaller mosques throughout Granada besides the grand mosque. If these can continue operating during the food crisis, if people can pray as they have always done while adapting to new governance... this prevents religious panic while everyone focuses on survival.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro turned practical: \"We need to communicate this immediately and clearly. Proclamations posted throughout the city. Criers in every quarter. Perhaps the vizier can help ensure the message reaches the Muslim population in terms they understand?\"\n\n\nAhmad bowed. \"I would be honored to serve in this capacity, Your Majesty. The people know my voice. If I tell them these are your terms, they will believe it.\"\n\n\nInfante Enrique observed: \"The garrison is already disarmed and dispersed. If we can get farmers into the vega within days, announce these policies by tomorrow, we might salvage a planting season yet.\"\n\n\nYour commanders waited. The emergency policies were clear. The question now was implementation - who would draft the proclamations, who would spread the word, how quickly could this happen?"
