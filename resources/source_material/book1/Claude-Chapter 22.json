      "say": "Thought process: Deliberating over appointing a western commander.\n\nThe user is starting Chapter 22. They're continuing a council of war after recent victories, with armies positioned in Málaga and Loja. They want to secure the western area west of Málaga with 11,000 troops and cannons, keeping the Master of Calatrava and Infante Enrique with them near Málaga.\n\nThe key question is: Who can Juan appoint to lead the army marching west?\n\nThis is a strategic military question during an active council. I should:\n1. Present the available commanders and their qualities\n2. Keep it SHORT (2-4 paragraphs) since this is during active conversation/council\n3. NOT suggest what Juan should choose\n4. Wait for Juan to make the decision\n\nLet me check the character tracker to see who the available commanders are.\n\n\nView: Checking the character tracker to identify available military commanders for the western campaign\n\n\nThought process: Reconciling chapter discrepancy and assessing military developments.\n\nGood, I have the character list. Now let me check what the most recent chapter was to understand the current military situation better. The tracker says it was last updated at the end of Chapter 18, but the user said this is Chapter 22, so I need to check what happened in the more recent chapters.\n\nLet me look at the recent chapter summaries to understand the current situation better.\n\n\nView: Checking the most recent chapter summaries to understand current military situation\n\n\nThought process\n\nGood, I can see Chapter 21 is the most recent. Let me check that to understand the current situation.\n\n\nView: Reading Chapter 21 summary to understand current military situation before Chapter 22\n\n\nThought process: Evaluated available commanders for western campaign leadership.\n\nPerfect! Now I understand the situation. At the end of Chapter 21, Juan has just taken Málaga and is planning the western campaign to secure the coast. He has:\n\n- 23,000 mobile troops (after garrison commitments of 11,000)\n- Plans to secure the western coast\n- 11,000 troops left for operations after leaving garrisons in Málaga and Loja\n\nThe user says they want to keep 11,000 troops and the cannons to secure the western area west of Málaga, and they want to keep the Master of Calatrava and Infante Enrique with them near Málaga.\n\nThe question is: Who can lead the army marching west?\n\nLooking at available commanders:\n- Rodrigo Manrique - was commanding western army from Seville originally (Character tracker says he's in Seville commanding western army operations)\n- Don Álvaro de Estúñiga - Senior military commander, was at Málaga siege\n- Master of Santiago (Don Luis de Guzmán) - With eastern army at Alcalá per tracker, but could be reassigned\n- Infante Juan de Aragón (\"Brother Juan\") - Listed as possibly with western army at Seville as senior advisor\n- Don Rodrigo de Perea - Scout commander and intelligence officer\n- Admiral Don Fadrique Enríquez - Naval commander, just finished Málaga blockade\n\nThe most logical candidates:\n1. Don Álvaro de Estúñiga - Senior commander who was at Málaga, experienced\n2. Rodrigo Manrique - Already commanding western operations\n3. Master of Santiago - Experienced military order commander\n4. Infante Juan de Aragón - Experienced commander serving as crusader\n\nI should present these options to Juan in a brief council format, stopping for him to make the decision. Keep it SHORT - 2-4 paragraphs during this council scene.\n\n\nChapter 22: Consolidating the West\n\n\nThe war council convenes in the captured Alcazaba's main hall, where maps of Granada's western territories spread across the table. The commanders stand around it—Don Álvaro de Estúñiga, the Master of Santiago, Admiral Don Fadrique Enríquez, and Don Rodrigo de Perea. The Master of Calatrava and Infante Enrique stand to your right, having just received their orders to remain with your force near Málaga.\n\n\nDon Álvaro de Estúñiga speaks first. \"Your Majesty, for the western march we have several capable commanders. Don Rodrigo Manrique has been coordinating operations from Seville—experienced frontier soldier, knows the terrain. But he's never had independent field command of this scale.\" He gestures toward the coastline on the map. \"Brother Juan\"—he uses Infante Juan's crusader name—\"remains in Seville as senior advisor to the western forces. Experienced commander, proven in Navarre's campaigns. His... past... makes some nobles uncomfortable, but his military skill is undeniable.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago leans forward. \"I could take the command, Your Majesty. Santiago has fought Moors on this coast for generations. My Order knows every fortress between here and Gibraltar.\" His enthusiasm is evident. \"Though I confess, my heart would rather see Granada's walls fall with your army.\"\n\n\nAdmiral Enríquez adds quietly: \"The fleet can support whoever you choose. My galleys will screen their advance, supply from the sea, and bombard any coastal fortress they approach.\"\n\n\nDon Álvaro meets your eyes. \"The western towns are smaller than Málaga. With your reputation spreading and our artillery, they may fall quickly. But the commander needs authority the garrisons will respect when they negotiate surrender.\"\n\n\nWho do you appoint to lead the 11,000 troops marching west?"

Plan for final assault on Granada capital in 1432\n\nI need to narrate the council's reaction to this decision and the Master of Santiago's response. The Master had expressed enthusiasm for this command, so he should be honored and enthusiastic. Other commanders should acknowledge the wisdom of consolidation before the final push.\n\nI should keep this response SHORT (2-4 paragraphs) since we're in an active council scene. Stop after the reactions so the player can continue directing the council or give further orders.\n\nDon't write Juan's dialogue or actions. Just narrate the world's response to his stated decision.\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago straightens, his weathered face breaking into a fierce grin. \"Your Majesty honors Santiago with this trust.\" He places his fist over his heart. \"I will take Marbella, Estepona, and every fortress to Gibraltar's shadow. They will fall or they will burn—but they will fall.\" His enthusiasm is infectious, years of frontier warfare distilled into pure confidence. \"Santiago rides west!\"\n\n\nDon Álvaro nods approvingly. \"Wisdom, Your Majesty. Let Granada watch their coastline crumble piece by piece through summer and autumn. By winter they'll be landlocked, isolated, starving. When we march on the capital in 1432, they'll have nowhere to run, no hope of relief.\" He traces the map with one finger. \"Consolidation now means overwhelming force later.\"\n\n\nAdmiral Enríquez adds: \"I'll attach six galleys permanently to the Master's advance—transport, supply, and bombardment support. With artillery from land and sea, those coastal fortresses won't hold long.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago studies the map, already planning his campaign. \"Marbella first—thirty miles west. Then Estepona, then the smaller fortresses. If we move fast and your reputation precedes us, Your Majesty, half may surrender without a fight.\" He looks up. \"I'll need those artillery pieces and Master Calabrese's expertise. Can you spare them?\"\n\n\nWhat are your orders for the artillery and the detailed composition of the western force?"

Stop after he asks if there are more questions/gives Juan a chance to respond.\n\nI need to be careful not to write Juan's responses or decisions.\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago nods sharply, absorbing the details. \"Ten thousand troops with artillery and fleet support—more than sufficient, Your Majesty.\" He calculates quickly. \"Heavy infantry for siege work and garrison duty, cavalry for screening and pursuit. The Military Orders will keep discipline tight.\" He glances at Admiral Enríquez. \"With six galleys, we can leapfrog down the coast—supply by sea, avoid long overland trains.\"\n\n\nMaster Gunner Calabrese steps forward, his Italian accent thick. \"Your Majesty, the five bombards—they work well together now, the crews know each rhythm. I come with the guns, yes? To coordinate the fire?\" There's professional pride in his voice. The man has reduced two major fortresses in four months; he knows his worth.\n\n\nDon Álvaro de Estúñiga adds a practical question: \"Supply and authority, Your Majesty. Does the Master report directly to you, or through the war council? And when fortresses surrender—does he have authority to offer the same terms you gave at Loja and Málaga, or must he send for your approval each time?\"\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago watches you, waiting.

No delays waiting for councils when opportunities arise.\"\n\n\nMaster Calabrese bows. \"I go with my guns, Your Majesty.

The council should react to this, likely with approval since it's prudent.\n\nI should:\n1. Have the commanders respond to this defensive strategy\n2.

      "say": "Thought process: Analyzed Sultan's dire straits and constructed realistic strategic options.\n\nLet me think about the Sultan's strategic situation realistically:\n\n**Granada's Position (July 1431):**\n- Lost two catastrophic field battles (Alcalá la Real, the Vega)\n- Lost major cities: Alcalá, Illora, Loja, Málaga, plus coastal fortresses\n- Western coast being systematically conquered\n- Landlocked after Málaga's fall\n- Field army destroyed twice\n- Remaining forces: ~10,000-14,000 troops, mostly garrison forces\n- Capital region threatened from multiple directions\n- Political instability, competing factions\n- Economic collapse - trade cut off, Vega devastated\n\n**Sultan's Realistic Options:**\n\n1. **Defensive consolidation** - Pull back, fortify Granada city and key remaining fortresses, wait for Castilian mistake or winter. Most cautious option.\n\n2. **Limited offensive** - Try to recapture one lost position (probably Loja as it's strategically vital and links coast to interior). High risk but could restore some prestige.\n\n3. **Guerrilla/raiding** - Avoid pitched battles, harass supply lines, raid isolated garrisons. Realistic given force disparity.\n\n4. **Negotiate** - Send envoys seeking terms, playing for time or trying to split Castilian coalition. Politically difficult but pragmatic.\n\n5. **Desperate all-in attack** - Stake everything on one major battle, hoping for miracle. Very unlikely unless Sultan is irrational.\n\n6. **Call for massive foreign aid** - Appeal to Morocco, other Muslim powers for major reinforcements. Takes time, uncertain.\n\n7. **Wait and do nothing** - Paralyzed by indecision, factional disputes prevent action.\n\nGiven medieval Islamic military doctrine and the Sultan's situation, let me create a realistic d100 table:\n\n**High probability (60-70%):** Defensive consolidation with some harassment/raiding. This is most realistic - he's been beaten badly twice, he needs to rebuild, but he can't just sit idle.\n \nI see a nuanced strategic landscape with multiple potential approaches. The Sultan faces limited but critical options. A moderate offensive could potentially restore some military credibility, targeting Loja as a key strategic point. This approach balances calculated risk with the need to demonstrate resilience. Political solutions remain challenging but not impossible, offering potential diplomatic alternatives to direct military confrontation. Internal political tensions further complicate decision-making, potentially paralyzing effective response.\n\nThe strategic calculus centers on avoiding total defeat while maintaining political legitimacy. Defensive consolidation with selective harassment tactics seems most prudent, allowing preservation of remaining military resources while inflicting incremental costs on the opponent. Diplomatic outreach to potential allies like Morocco could provide critical external support during this vulnerable period.\n\nLoja emerges as an optimal target due to its precarious post-conquest status and critical geographic positioning. A focused assault could potentially fracture Juan's territorial control, creating strategic leverage with minimal risk of total military collapse.\n\n\nSultan Yusuf III's Strategic Response - July 1431\n\n\nI'll create a d100 table for the Sultan's strategy given his desperate situation. He's lost two major battles, his second city, and faces a two-front war. His remaining ~10,000-14,000 troops face military, political, and morale challenges.\n\n\nd100 Table: Granada's Response\n\n\n1-15: Pure Defense - Sultan withdraws entirely to defensive posture. Fortifies Granada city and remaining key strongholds. No offensive action. Hopes Castilians make mistakes or winter arrives. Politically weak but preserves remaining forces.\n\n\n16-40: Defense + Harassment - Fortifies Granada but sends light cavalry and raiders (2,000-3,000 troops) to harass Castilian supply lines, ambush patrols, raid isolated positions. Makes occupation costly without risking main force. Most realistic blend of caution and action.\n\n\n41-60: Limited Offensive - Loja - Sultan commits main army (~8,000-10,000) to recapture Loja. Strategically vital, recently captured garrison might not be fully settled, success would cut Juan's territory in two. High risk but logical military objective. Shows his commanders he's not paralyzed.\n\n\n61-72: Guerrilla Campaign - Abandons conventional warfare entirely. Disperses forces into raiding bands. Ambushes, scorched earth, making every mile costly. Long-term strategy acknowledging he cannot win pitched battles. Frustrates Castilians but cedes initiative.\n\n\n73-82: Diplomatic Offensive - Sends envoys to Juan offering terms (tribute, territorial concessions, hostages) while fortifying defenses. Plays for time, hopes to split Castilian coalition or wait for political changes. Realistic for a desperate ruler buying time.\n\n\n83-90: Major Foreign Aid Appeal - Massive embassy to Morocco and North African powers. Offers trade concessions, territorial guarantees, religious appeals. Prepares for prolonged resistance hoping relief arrives. Takes months to bear fruit if successful at all.\n\n\n91-95: Internal Paralysis - Competing factions (fight-to-death vs. negotiate vs. flee) prevent unified strategy. Confused, contradictory orders. Some commanders raid, others fortify, some seek private terms. Granada fragments politically.\n\n\n96-98: Desperate All-In Gamble - Sultan stakes everything on one major attack on Juan's main force near Málaga. Hopes for miracle victory to reverse momentum. Politically driven by need to \"do something.\" Almost certainly ends in catastrophe.\n\n\n99-100: Catastrophic Blunder - Splits forces attempting multiple objectives, leaves capital undermanned, or makes major strategic error. Desperation and poor counsel lead to disaster.\n\n\n\nMost Likely Range (16-60, 45% probability): Some form of active response—either harassment or attempt to recapture Loja. Sultan cannot afford to appear paralyzed, but he's been beaten badly twice and must be cautious.\n\n\nGM Assessment: Given two crushing defeats, loss of Málaga, and internal political pressure, the Sultan faces impossible choices. Pure defense looks weak to his own nobles. Attacking risks third catastrophic defeat. Most realistic: try to make occupation painful through raiding OR attempt limited objective like Loja to restore some prestige.\n\n\nWhen you're ready, roll d100 and I'll narrate the Sultan's decision and its execution."

The timeline is critical—embassies take weeks to arrive, negotiations take time, and any aid takes months to mobilize and transport.\n\n\nd100 Table: Foreign Aid Appeal Success\n\n\n1-20: Complete Failure - Sultan's envoys reach Morocco but find doors closed. The Marinid Sultan views Granada as lost cause, fears Portuguese retaliation if he intervenes, and has internal troubles. Offers symbolic prayers but no troops or money. Embassy returns empty-handed by October. Granada is truly alone.\n\n\n21-45: Token Support Only - Morocco sends diplomatic encouragement, religious scholars to boost morale, perhaps 50,000 dinars in emergency funds and some military advisors. Symbolic rather than strategic. Shows solidarity but no meaningful military impact. Embarrassing half-measure that highlights Granada's abandonment.\n\n\n46-65: Modest Success - Morocco commits to sending expeditionary force but timeline is long. Promises 2,000-3,000 troops and supplies arriving late autumn/winter 1431. Not enough to change strategic situation but enough to complicate Juan's plans. Money arrives faster (100,000+ dinars by September). Granada gets breathing room, not salvation.\n\n\n66-80: Significant Support - Morocco takes threat seriously. Commits 4,000-5,000 troops with experienced commanders, significant funds (200,000+ dinars), and military supplies. Forces begin arriving October/November. Enough to matter strategically—Juan would face 15,000-20,000 enemy troops by winter. Changes calculations for 1432 campaign.\n\n\n81-90: Major Commitment - Full Marinid intervention. 6,000-8,000 Moroccan troops, elite units, substantial funds (300,000+ dinars), naval support. Religious fervor mobilized—this is jihad against Castilian crusade. First contingents arrive September, main force October/November. Granada becomes Moroccan-backed proxy war. Juan faces genuinely dangerous 1432 campaign.\n\n\n91-96: Regional Coalition - Morocco rallies multiple North African powers. Tunis, Tlemcen, and Morocco collectively commit 8,000-10,000 troops and massive funds. Pan-Islamic response to crusade. Becomes international crisis. Complications for Juan: Aragon pressured by North African threats to Mediterranean, naval warfare intensifies, crusade becomes multi-year commitment.\n\n\n97-99: Strategic Game-Changer - Morocco commits 10,000+ troops AND proposes joint naval offensive against Castilian coast while Granada reinforced. Threatens to open new fronts. Genoese merchants might switch sides if threatened. Could force Juan to divide forces or negotiate. Timeline still months away but fundamentally alters strategic picture.\n\n\n100: Miraculous Intervention - Perfect storm: Morocco inspired by religious fervor, other powers join, massive force committed with promise of more, AND some arrive quickly (by late August/September) via emergency naval transport. Granada gets 12,000+ reinforcements by autumn. Sultan's position suddenly viable again. Juan's conquest stalls.\n\n\n\nGM Assessment:\n\n\nMost Likely Range (21-65, 45% probability): Token to modest support. Morocco historically was in decline by 1430s and wary of major commitments. They'd likely send something (Granada is their last Muslim ally in Iberia, religious optics matter), but major expeditionary forces are expensive and risky.\n\n\nRealistic Ceiling (66-90, 24% probability): Significant commitment is possible if Morocco views this as genuine jihad and fears Portugal will attack them next if Granada falls. Would take months to mobilize.\n\n\nTimeline Reality: Even with success, meaningful forces can't arrive before September at earliest, more likely October/November. This gives Juan 2-3 more months of current operational tempo.\n\n\nHistorical Note: Real Granada survived until 1492 partly because Morocco DID occasionally send aid when things got desperate, though never enough to truly turn the tide.\n\n\nRoll d100 when ready and I'll narrate the diplomatic mission's outcome and its implications for the campaign."

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated diplomatic narrative spanning months of negotiations and material arrivals.\n\nThe player rolled 52, which falls in the \"Modest Success\" range (46-65). Let me detail what happens with Granada's diplomatic mission over the next few months.\n\nKey elements of Modest Success:\n- Morocco commits to sending expeditionary force\n- 2,000-3,000 troops promised\n- Arriving late autumn/winter 1431\n- Money arrives faster - 100,000+ dinars by September\n- Not enough to change strategic situation but complicates Juan's plans\n- Granada gets breathing room, not salvation\n\nI need to narrate:\n1. The embassy's departure and journey\n2. Morocco's internal deliberations\n3. The decision and terms\n4. Timeline of when money/troops arrive\n5. How this affects Granada's morale and strategy\n6. How Juan learns about this (intelligence)\n\nI should keep this \"brief\" as requested, but cover the key developments from July through October when the effects fully materialize.\n\n\nGranada's Foreign Gambit - July to October 1431\n\n\nJuly: The Embassy Departs\n\n\nWithin days of Málaga's fall, Sultan Yusuf III dispatches his most persuasive diplomat—the same Abu Abdullah al-Zaghal who came to Seville last year—accompanied by religious scholars and bearing desperate letters. They sail from a minor port Granada still controls, racing across the Strait to Ceuta and then overland to the Marinid court at Fez.\n\n\nThe message is stark: The last Muslim kingdom in Al-Andalus faces extinction. Christian crusaders take our cities. Without aid, Granada falls by next summer.\n\n\nAugust: Fez Deliberates\n\n\nThe Marinid Sultan Abd al-Haqq II is only seventeen and weak, surrounded by regents and powerful viziers with competing interests. The council debates for weeks:\n\n\nAgainst intervention: Morocco has internal troubles. Portugal threatens their northern borders. Castile's navy dominates the strait. Granada has asked for help before and wasted it.\n\n\nFor intervention: Religious duty demands response to crusade. If Granada falls, Portugal and Castile turn on Morocco next. Pan-Islamic credibility at stake. Granada's gold and desperate promises are attractive.\n\n\nThe Compromise (Late August): Morocco commits to a modest expeditionary force—enough to show solidarity, not enough to bankrupt themselves or invite Portuguese retaliation. They promise 2,500 troops (mix of regular soldiers and tribal volunteers) with experienced commanders, to arrive by November when weather permits crossing. Immediate financial aid: 120,000 gold dinars sent by fast galley, arriving Granada in early September.\n\n\nSeptember: Money Arrives, Hope Rises\n\n\nThe Moroccan gold reaches Granada in early September. Sultan Yusuf uses it immediately:\n\n\nPays overdue wages to garrison troops (preventing mutinies)\n\nPurchases emergency grain supplies from remaining trade partners\n\nHires mercenaries from the city's desperate refugees\n\nBribes wavering commanders to stay loyal\n\nBegins modest fortification improvements around capital\n\n\nGranada's morale lifts marginally. The Sultan has done something. Proof that the Muslim world hasn't abandoned them. Rumors spread through the markets: \"Moroccan armies are coming. Thousands of warriors. The tide will turn.\"\n\n\nReality is less impressive, but hope is a currency in desperate times.\n\n\nOctober: Reinforcements En Route\n\n\nBy October, Morocco begins assembling the promised force at Ceuta. Weather and logistics delay them—November crossing is realistic, perhaps late October if conditions permit. The troops are adequate: some veteran infantry, tribal cavalry, religious volunteers inspired by jihad rhetoric. Not elite, but not worthless either. Led by an experienced Moroccan commander, Qaid Ali ibn Rashid.\n\n\nGranada prepares to receive them. The Sultan plans to integrate them into capital defenses and perhaps send raiding forces to harass Castilian positions through winter.\n\n\nJuan's Intelligence (Late September/Early October)\n\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea's scouts intercept messages and interrogate captured raiders. Reports reach you:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, Granada has secured Moroccan support. Gold has already arrived—we've seen increased activity in their markets, fresh wages being paid. Military aid is promised, perhaps 2,000-3,000 troops arriving by winter. Our sources suggest late October or November landing.\"\n\n\nThe assessment: Not enough to reverse Granada's strategic collapse, but enough to make them dangerous again. They'll have fresh troops for winter raiding and 1432 will be harder than if you'd finished them this year.\n\n\nStrategic Impact:\n\n\nBy late autumn 1431, Granada has:\n\n\nStabilized financially (temporarily)\n\nReinforced morale among defenders\n\n2,500 additional troops arriving soon\n\nAbility to continue resistance into 1432\n\nRenewed hope delaying surrender negotiations\n\n\nIt doesn't change the war's outcome, but it extends the timeline and ensures 1432 will require serious campaigning rather than mopping up isolated fortresses.\n\n\n\nWhat are your orders as autumn approaches and this intelligence reaches you?"

This is an important strategic question.\n\nContext:\n- Sultan's main strategy (rolled 86) was Major Foreign Aid Appeal\n- He's sent the embassy and is waiting for results\n- He has ~10,000-14,000 troops still\n- He knows aid is coming but won't arrive until October/November\n- He faces two Castilian armies: Juan's ~13,000 near Málaga, and Master of Santiago's ~10,000 marching west\n- His strategic goal is to SURVIVE until reinforcements arrive\n\nKey considerations:\n1. He knows help is coming - his goal is to last until then\n2. He can't afford another major defeat - he's lost two armies already\n3. He needs to look active enough to keep his own nobles from deposing him\n4. He needs to slow Juan down but not risk everything\n5. He has limited resources and morale is fragile\n\nRealistic options range from:\n- Pure defense/passive waiting (safest but politically risky - looks weak)\n- Harassment/guerrilla tactics (safe, makes Juan's life harder, buys time)\n- Defensive fortifications and preparations\n- Limited raids or probing attacks\n- Attempting to recapture something small\n- Overcommitting and risking disaster\n\nMost realistic: Some form of active defense - harassment, raids, making occupation painful while avoiding major battles. He needs to buy time, not win victories.\n\nLet me create a realistic d100 table.\n\n\nSultan Yusuf III's Operational Strategy While Awaiting Moroccan Aid\nJuly - October 1431\n\n\nThe Sultan's main strategy is buying time until Moroccan reinforcements arrive. What does he do operationally during these critical months?\n\n\nd100 Table: Granada's Holding Strategy\n\n\n1-10: Pure Passivity - Sultan orders complete defensive withdrawal. All forces pull back to Granada city and a few key strongholds. No offensive operations whatsoever. Focuses entirely on fortification, supply stockpiling, and internal security. Politically dangerous—some commanders see this as cowardice and defeatism. Morale suffers, but forces preserved intact.\n\n\n11-35: Defensive Fortification Focus - Sultan commits resources to strengthening remaining positions. Repairs walls, improves Granada's defenses, prepares supply depots. Sends small cavalry patrols for intelligence but avoids engagement. Minimal harassment of Castilians. Conservative but sensible—prepares for Moroccan integration and 1432 campaign. Shows prudence over bravado.\n\n\n36-60: Active Harassment Campaign - Sultan deploys light cavalry and raiders (1,500-2,500 troops) to make Castilian occupation painful. Ambush supply convoys, raid isolated garrisons, intercept messengers, strike foraging parties. Avoid pitched battles but inflict steady casualties. Forces Juan to spread troops, slows Master of Santiago's coastal campaign. Balances caution with activity.\n\n\n61-75: Aggressive Raiding Strategy - More aggressive version of harassment. Commits 3,000-4,000 troops to systematic raiding across multiple fronts. Targets Loja garrison supplies, hits Master of Santiago's columns, raids deep into Juan's territory. Risks larger engagements but shows strength to demoralized troops and skeptical nobles. Could suffer setbacks but buys time effectively.\n\n\n76-85: Limited Objective - Probe for Weakness - Sultan sends strong force (4,000-5,000 troops) to test Castilian positions, looking for isolated garrison or weak point. If opportunity presents itself (overextended patrol, undermanned fortress), seize it for morale victory. If opposition strong, withdraw. Calculated risk—seeks opportunity without committing to major battle.\n\n\n86-92: Overambitious Counter-Offensive - Political pressure and desperate optimism lead Sultan to attempt recapture of recently lost position (Vélez-Málaga, Fuengirola, or even Loja). Commits 6,000-8,000 troops. High risk—another defeat could be catastrophic before Moroccan aid arrives. Shows boldness but poor judgment given strategic situation.\n\n\n93-97: Divided Strategy / Internal Conflict - Competing factions prevent unified approach. Some commanders raid aggressively, others stay defensive. Resources split between fortification and offensive prep. Confused execution means neither defense nor offense effective. Wastes the waiting period with internal squabbling.\n\n\n98-99: Desperate Gamble Before Aid Arrives - Sultan attempts major operation (attacking Juan's main army or Master of Santiago) hoping to win victory before Moroccans arrive to \"earn\" their respect and support. Terrible timing, risks disaster right when help is coming. Political desperation overrules military sense.\n\n\n100: Strategic Disaster - Major blunder: attacks just as Moroccans are arriving, disrupts coordination; or gets caught repositioning forces; or loses key commander to assassination/defection. Whatever time was bought gets wasted through catastrophic error.\n\n\n\nGM Assessment:\n\n\nMost Likely Range (36-75, 55% probability): Some form of harassment/raiding campaign. Sultan must show activity to keep his nobles from deposing him and to prove Granada worth saving to Morocco, but cannot risk another major defeat. Raiding accomplishes both: looks active, inflicts casualties, avoids decisive battle.\n\n\nSecond Most Likely (11-35, 25% probability): Conservative fortification focus. Risk-averse Sultan decides best contribution to war effort is preserving his army intact until reinforcements arrive. Politically harder but militarily sound.\n\n\nTimeline Note: The more aggressive his strategy (75+), the more likely he suffers setbacks that weaken him before Moroccan aid arrives. Conservative strategies (11-60) mean he enters winter with forces largely intact.\n\n\nImpact on Juan:\n\n\nPassive/fortification (1-35): Your operations proceed smoothly, minimal interference\n\nHarassment (36-75): Steady attrition, supply problems, need stronger garrison security\n\nAggressive (76+): Potential crisis requiring your direct response, but opportunity to inflict another defeat\n\n\nRoll d100 when ready and I'll narrate Granada's operational approach through summer and autumn 1431."

Overwhelming force vs. smaller coastal towns\n2. Artillery that has proven devastating at Málaga and Loja\n3. Naval support for supply and bombardment\n4. Juan's reputation for honoring surrender terms is spreading\n5. Master of Santiago is experienced frontier commander\n6. Military Order troops provide disciplined core\n7. Granada is demoralized after Málaga's fall\n8. Sultan focused on harassment campaign (rolled 57), not defending west coast heavily\n\nFailure/complication factors:\n1. Granada's harassment campaign (rolled 57) could hit his supply lines\n2. Troops are somewhat fatigued after Málaga siege\n3. Summer heat intensifying\n4. Garrisons might resist hoping for Moroccan aid\n5. Distance from Juan's main force - harder to get support\n6. Some fortresses might be better defended than expected\n7. Coordination challenges with naval support\n8. Master of Santiago's enthusiasm might lead to overextension\n\nRealistic targets over 30 days:\n- Marbella (30 miles west of Málaga) - medium fortress\n- Estepona (15 miles beyond Marbella) - smaller fortress\n- Various minor coastal positions\n- Maybe start on larger objectives\n\nGiven these factors, what's realistic for 30 days? The Master has proven artillery, overwhelming force, and good support. Granada is focusing on harassment not defending the coast. But he still needs to march, conduct sieges, accept surrenders, leave garrisons.\n \nI anticipate a moderate campaign with mixed outcomes. Two to three key fortresses will likely fall, with some resistance and potential disruptions. The combination of military strength and strategic positioning gives a high probability of partial success, though not a complete conquest. Unexpected challenges could emerge, potentially slowing progress or creating tactical complications.\n\n\nMaster of Santiago's Western Campaign - First 30 Days (July 10 - August 10, 1431)\n\n\nI'll create a d100 table for the campaign's progress. The Master commands 10,000 troops with artillery and naval support against smaller coastal fortresses. Granada's harassment strategy (rolled 57) will complicate but not stop operations.\n\n\nd100 Table: Western Campaign Results - First Month\n\n\n1-5: Catastrophic Setback - Major disaster strikes. Granada's raiders ambush the army during march, or Master makes critical error in judgment. Heavy casualties (800-1,200 men), artillery damaged or lost, campaign stalls completely. Master of Santiago wounded or discredited. Requires Juan's direct intervention to salvage situation.\n\n\n6-15: Significant Complications - Multiple problems converge. Granada raiders hit supply trains successfully, heat causes serious attrition, one fortress resists longer than expected. Takes only ONE objective (likely Marbella) with higher casualties than anticipated (400-600). Campaign behind schedule, morale strained. Master frustrated but determined.\n\n\n16-30: Modest Progress with Difficulties - Takes Marbella after week-long siege but faces resistance and complications. Granada harassment effective against supply lines. Second objective (Estepona or minor fortress) either still under siege or bypassed due to problems. Captures 1-2 positions total. Casualties moderate (250-400). On track but struggling.\n\n\n31-50: Steady Progress - Campaign proceeds competently but unspectacularly. Marbella falls after 5-7 days (one offer refused, bombardment, surrender). Estepona falls more easily (surrenders after seeing Marbella's fate). Takes 2 significant fortresses plus 1-2 minor positions. Casualties light-moderate (150-250). Granada raiders annoy but don't stop advance. Solid professional campaign.\n\n\n51-70: Good Success - Master of Santiago performs well. Marbella falls quickly (4-5 days), Estepona surrenders after single offer, reputation effect working. Takes 2-3 significant fortresses plus several minor positions. Granada harassment ineffective against strong columns. Casualties light (80-150). Naval coordination excellent. Campaign ahead of schedule, morale high.\n\n\n71-85: Excellent Results - Everything clicks. Reputation effect strong—multiple garrisons surrender seeing artillery arrive. Takes 3-4 significant positions (Marbella, Estepona, plus others) with minimal fighting. Casualties very light (40-80). Granada raiders fail to disrupt operations. Master demonstrates tactical brilliance. Western coast crumbling faster than expected.\n\n\n86-94: Outstanding Success - Master of Santiago exceeds all expectations. Cascade of surrenders as reputation spreads like wildfire. Takes 4-5 significant fortresses plus numerous minor positions. Some garrisons surrender before he even arrives after hearing news. Casualties minimal (15-40). Granada harassment attempts crushed. By month's end, approaching Gibraltar's approaches. Spectacular campaign.\n\n\n95-98: Strategic Windfall - Beyond military success, political/strategic bonus. Major Granada commander defects with troops, or discovers major intelligence, or captures significant figure, or uncovers diplomatic opportunity. Territory gains PLUS game-changing advantage. Master of Santiago becomes legendary. Changes strategic calculus for entire war.\n\n\n99-100: Miraculous Campaign - Perfect storm of success. Entire western coast to Gibraltar collapses in 30 days. Multiple simultaneous surrenders, zero casualties in some operations, massive supplies/treasure captured. Granada's western infrastructure disintegrates. Master returns in triumph having accomplished 3 months' work in one. Sultan's position becomes completely untenable.\n\n\n\nGM Assessment:\n\n\nMost Likely Range (31-70, 40% probability): Steady to good progress. Takes 2-3 major positions in 30 days. Master is experienced, forces are strong, artillery devastating. Granada's harassment campaign (rolled 57) will be annoying but not crippling given his force size and naval support.\n\n\nSuccess Factors Working For Him:\n\n\nOverwhelming force advantage\n\nProven artillery effectiveness\n\nJuan's surrender reputation spreading\n\nNaval supply securing logistics\n\nProfessional Military Order core\n\nExperienced frontier commander\n\nGranada demoralized and distracted\n\n\nComplications Working Against Him:\n\n\nGranada's active harassment (rolled 57) - will hit supply lines, foraging parties, isolated detachments\n\nSummer heat and troop fatigue\n\nDistance from Juan's support\n\nSome fortresses might resist hoping for Moroccan aid news\n\nGarrison duties spreading his forces\n\n\nRealistic Outcome: Likely captures Marbella and Estepona plus 1-2 smaller positions over 30 days. Each siege taking 4-7 days with artillery. Some harassment casualties but nothing crippling. Professional, effective campaign that grinds forward steadily.\n\n\nTime Required Per Fortress (rough):\n\n\nMarch and deployment: 2-3 days\n\nSurrender offer: 1 day\n\nIf refused, bombardment: 3-5 days\n\nAssault/surrender: 1 day\n\nGarrison establishment: 1-2 days\n\nTotal per fortress: 8-12 days if resisted, 4-6 days if surrenders quickly\n\n\nRoll d100 when ready and I'll narrate the Master of Santiago's first month of campaigning."

Stop after presenting the situation and let him decide how to respond.\n\n\nThirty Days of Friction - July 10 to August 10, 1431\n\n\nWeek One: July 10-17\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago departs Málaga at dawn on July 10th with his column—10,000 troops, five bombards rumbling on their carriages, supply train stretching a mile behind. Admiral Enríquez's six galleys shadow the coast. You watch from the Alcazaba as the dust cloud moves west, then turn back to your own concerns.\n\n\nThe first reports are optimistic. A messenger arrives July 13th: \"Your Majesty, the Master reached Marbella yesterday. Town smaller than Málaga but well-fortified. He offers surrender terms today. Expects answer tomorrow.\"\n\n\nBut the second message, arriving July 15th, carries different tone. Captain's handwriting shows strain: \"Marbella refuses surrender. Garrison commander says he awaits news from Granada—believes Moroccan aid is coming. Master begins bombardment. Some complication with positioning guns on rocky terrain. Admiral's galleys provide fire support from sea.\"\n\n\nYour own scouts bring troubling news that same day. Don Rodrigo enters your command post, dusty from riding. \"Your Majesty, Granada is active. Not attacking fortresses, but hitting our supply lines. Three separate raids in the past week—convoy ambushed near Loja, foraging party cut up east of here, messenger patrol disappeared. Light cavalry, hit and run. They're making us bleed.\"\n\n\nWeek Two: July 18-24\n\n\nThe pattern continues. Granada's raiders strike where you're weakest—isolated patrols, supply wagons between garrisons, foraging parties venturing too far. Nothing catastrophic, but steady attrition. You order larger escorts, tighter defensive postures. It slows everything down.\n\n\nFrom the west, Master Calabrese sends technical report July 20th: \"Marbella walls harder than expected. Stone quality good, repairs recent. Rocky ground makes gun positioning difficult—two bombards had to be relocated after three days. Progress steady but slow. Estimate three more days bombardment needed.\"\n\n\nThen, July 22nd, grimmer news. The Master of Santiago's own dispatch: \"Your Majesty, Granada raiders hit our supply train from Málaga. Fifty wagons, destroyed or captured. Casualties: 40 dead, 60 wounded. They knew the route, struck at narrow pass. We drove them off but damage done. Requesting replacement supplies by sea. Bombardment of Marbella continues—breach should be ready July 24th or 25th.\"\n\n\nDon Álvaro reads the message over your shoulder. \"They're fighting smart, Your Majesty. Can't beat us in battle, so they make logistics hell. Classic frontier warfare.\"\n\n\nWeek Three: July 25-31\n\n\nMarbella finally falls July 26th. The messenger arrives exhausted: \"Your Majesty, Marbella taken. Breach achieved July 25th, assault at dawn 26th. Garrison resisted fiercely—fought room to room in fortress. Casualties: 180 dead, 240 wounded. Many more than Málaga. Plunder proceeding per your orders. Garrison commander killed in fighting. Master establishing 800-man garrison, will march on Estepona in three days.\"\n\n\nYou note the tone—pride in victory, but weariness. This wasn't the easy triumph everyone expected.\n\n\nMore raids hit your positions. July 28th: patrol of 30 men ambushed near Illora, only 12 return. July 30th: foraging party attacked, loses half its supplies. August 1st: raiders strike near Loja's outer walls at night, burn some supplies before driven off.\n\n\nDon Rodrigo estimates: \"Your Majesty, we're losing 20-30 men per week to these pinprick raids. Not crippling, but morale suffers. Men fear riding out in small groups. Foraging becomes expedition requiring 200 troops. Everything takes longer, costs more.\"\n\n\nWeek Four: August 2-10\n\n\nThe Master of Santiago reaches Estepona August 3rd. His report is terse: \"Began march August 1st. Granada raiders shadowed us—hit rearguard twice, scattered when we turned. Lost 35 men, some supplies. Reached Estepona today. Offering surrender terms tomorrow. Town smaller than Marbella, should fall quicker if they refuse.\"\n\n\nAugust 5th brings mixed news. \"Estepona refuses surrender—commander says Moroccan fleet approaches, help is coming. Beginning bombardment. Admiral reports no Moroccan fleet visible, believes it's false hope. Will have walls breached in 4-5 days.\"\n\n\nBut Granada's harassment intensifies as if sensing the coastal campaign's difficulties. August 7th: Major raid hits supply convoy from Seville bound for the Master's army—250 men escorting, ambushed by 400-500 Moorish cavalry. Half the supplies lost, 40 dead, 70 wounded. The convoy commander survives: \"They knew exactly where we'd be, Your Majesty. Waited in the hills, struck like lightning. Professional soldiers, not bandits.\"\n\n\nBy August 10th, Estepona remains under siege. The Master's latest dispatch: \"Bombardment proceeds. Breach imminent, assault planned for August 12th. Casualties to date from all causes: 280 dead, 380 wounded. Have taken one major fortress (Marbella), one minor coastal fort (taken during march), currently besieging Estepona. Request reinforcements for garrisons—spreading thin.\"\n\n\nDon Álvaro summarizes the situation in your command tent that evening, maps spread before you. \"Your Majesty, the western campaign proceeds, but it's hard going. Granada's making them pay for every mile. The Master has taken Marbella and should have Estepona within days—that's respectable progress. But it's cost 250-400 casualties and he's only taken two significant positions in a month. At this rate, reaching Gibraltar takes until October, maybe later.\"\n\n\nHe points to marks on the map showing raid locations. \"And Granada's hitting us everywhere—here, here, here. We're losing 30-40 men per week across all positions. Supply lines strained, troops cautious. They can't stop us, but they're making us bleed.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo adds: \"Their light cavalry is everywhere, Your Majesty. Small bands, 50-100 men, striking and vanishing. We kill some, but they replace them. It's what they're good at—frontier warfare, raiding, harassment. They learned it fighting us for two centuries.\"\n\n\nInfante Enrique, standing by the window, speaks quietly. \"They're buying time, Your Majesty. Waiting for something—probably those Moroccan reinforcements we've heard rumors about. Make us bleed through summer, hope help arrives by autumn.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Calatrava nods. \"And our men tire. Four months of campaigning in summer heat. We've won every battle, taken every fortress we've attacked. But the troops feel the weight. Garrison duty is tedious, patrols are dangerous. This war isn't over quickly like they hoped.\"\n\n\nDon Álvaro meets your eyes. \"Your Majesty, we're winning. Territorially, strategically, militarily—we're winning.

But the user IS Juan II and is speaking directly to Enrique, so I should have Enrique respond to Juan's question.\n\nI should:\n1. Have Enrique respond to Juan's question\n2. Possibly have other advisors react to this tactical decision\n3. Stop and wait for Juan's next input\n\nThis is good strategic thinking from Juan - using mobile cavalry to counter raiders, giving Enrique an independent command that plays to his strengths, and recognizing that the raiders' operational space is shrinking.\n\n\nInfante Enrique straightens, his eyes lighting with purpose. He's been waiting months for another independent command since Fuengirola. \"Yes, Your Majesty. I am ready.\" He steps to the map, studying the raid locations marked across the territory. \"Three thousand cavalry—enough to match or overmatch any raiding band they field. We can patrol aggressively, respond rapidly, force them to scatter or fight on our terms.\"\n\n\nHis finger traces routes between the captured fortresses. \"You're right—their space contracts with every fortress we take. They must stage from somewhere, water their horses, rest between raids. Find their staging areas, and we find them.\" There's hunger in his voice. \"They've been ghosts, striking and vanishing. Time to make them afraid to venture out.\"\n\n\nDon Álvaro nods approvingly. \"Sound strategy, Your Majesty. Counter-raiders with raiders. Enrique's a natural cavalry commander—aggressive, quick-thinking. Give him good scouts and he'll hunt them down.\" He calculates quickly. \"Three thousand cavalry from our force here leaves us ten thousand infantry and artillery. Still strong enough to hold defensive positions while supporting your mobile operations.\"\n\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea leans forward. \"Your Majesty, I request twenty of my best scouts be attached to Infante Enrique's force. Light riders who know the terrain, speak Arabic, can track and gather intelligence. They'll be his eyes.\"\n\n\nThe Master of Calatrava adds: \"And the thousand reinforcements for the Master of Santiago—infantry for garrison duty?

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed Enrique's counter-raiding prospects against Granada's mobile frontier fighters.\n\nLet me evaluate Infante Enrique's counter-raiding campaign realistically. He has:\n\n**Advantages:**\n- 3,000 cavalry (mix of light and heavy) - superior numbers to typical raiding bands\n- 20 expert scouts from Don Rodrigo\n- ~40-55 Gibralfaro troops and converts who speak Arabic and know the terrain\n- Funds for bribes and informants\n- Aggressive commander with cavalry expertise\n- Granada's operational space shrinking as more fortresses fall\n- Can coordinate with fixed positions (Málaga, Loja, etc.)\n- Granada already committed to harassment strategy (rolled 57) so raiders are active and exposed\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Granada's raiders are experienced frontier fighters (200 years of this)\n- They know the terrain intimately\n- Local population may sympathize with Muslim raiders over Christian crusaders\n- Raiders can scatter and blend into population\n- Summer heat affects cavalry operations\n- Enrique is setting up new intelligence network from scratch\n- Raiders are mobile and can avoid engagement if they choose\n- Some villages may be too afraid to inform (fear of raider reprisals)\n\n**Granada's Raider Profile (from roll 57):**\n- 1,500-2,500 troops committed to raiding\n- Light cavalry, hit-and-run tactics\n- Professional soldiers, not bandits\n- Organized, coordinated attacks\n- Know when/where convoys moving (good intelligence)\n\n**Realistic Assessment:**\nEnrique has significant advantages in numbers and resources, but he's fighting a counter-insurgency/counter-raiding campaign which is notoriously difficult. The raiders' advantage is mobility and local knowledge. Enrique's advantage is superior force and shrinking operational space for the enemy.\n\nMost likely outcome: Moderate success. He'll catch some raiding bands, force others to be more cautious, reduce raiding effectiveness. But unlikely to eliminate them completely in first 30 days. Some will escape, some will hide, some may inflict casualties on his forces.\n\n\nI'll map out a probability scale that reflects the campaign's complexity. The range captures the nuanced challenges Enrique faces - not a total victory, but not a complete failure either. The scale acknowledges his strengths while recognizing the inherent difficulties of frontier warfare against experienced raiders.\n\n\nInfante Enrique's Counter-Raiding Campaign - 30 Days (Mid-August to Mid-September 1431)\n\n\nEnrique has 3,000 cavalry, expert scouts, Muslim informants, funds for intelligence, and orders to hunt down Granada's raiders who have been bleeding your forces. Let me evaluate realistically.\n\n\nd100 Table: Enrique's Counter-Raiding Success\n\n\n1-8: Campaign Failure - Enrique's operations backfire badly. Raiders ambush one of his columns, inflicting heavy casualties (150-250 men). Intelligence network compromised—informants killed or turned. Raiders become more effective, emboldened. Enrique forced to adopt defensive posture. Your losses to raiding actually increase. Requires rethinking entire approach.\n\n\n9-20: Poor Results - Enrique struggles to adapt to guerrilla warfare. Catches few raiders (kills 50-100), but at cost of similar casualties to his own forces. Intelligence network slow to develop—locals afraid or unsympathetic. Raiders remain elusive, continue operations nearly unhindered. Frustrating, grinding campaign with little to show. Raiding continues at roughly same level.\n\n\n21-40: Modest Success - Mixed results. Enrique destroys 2-3 small raiding bands (200-300 enemy killed/captured total), forces others to be more cautious. Raids reduce by ~30-40%. But several of his patrols ambushed, casualties moderate (100-180). Intelligence network developing slowly. Some locals cooperate, others resist. Raiders hurt but not broken. Progress but frustratingly slow.\n\n\n41-60: Solid Performance - Enrique adapts well to counter-raiding. Destroys 4-5 raiding bands (400-500 enemy killed/captured), captures staging areas. Intelligence network functioning—informants providing useful tips. Raids reduced by 50-60%. His casualties acceptable (60-120). Granada's raiders forced onto defensive, operational space shrinking. Clear improvement but raiders still active in reduced capacity.\n\n\n61-78: Good Success - Enrique proves highly effective. Destroys 6-8 raiding bands (600-800 enemy killed/captured), captures multiple staging camps and supply caches. Intelligence network excellent—Gibralfaro troops and paid informants deliver actionable intelligence regularly. Raids reduced by 70%. His casualties light (30-80). Granada's raiding capability seriously degraded. Several successful \"hammer and anvil\" operations (light cavalry pins, heavy cavalry destroys).\n\n\n79-88: Excellent Results - Enrique demonstrates masterful counter-insurgency. Destroys 10+ raiding bands (1,000+ enemy killed/captured), eliminates most staging areas, captures senior raider commanders. Intelligence network highly effective—locals increasingly cooperate seeing Christian strength. Raids reduced by 85-90%. His casualties minimal (15-40). Granada's organized raiding essentially collapsed, only scattered bands remain. Your supply lines flow freely again.\n\n\n89-95: Outstanding Campaign - Enrique exceeds all expectations. Systematic destruction of raider infrastructure. 1,200-1,500 enemy killed/captured, multiple commanders captured/killed, discovers and destroys main coordination center. Intelligence network so effective that raiders can barely operate—informants everywhere. Raids reduced 90-95%. Nearly bloodless for Enrique's forces (under 20 casualties). Granada forced to abandon harassment strategy entirely.\n\n\n96-98: Strategic Breakthrough - Beyond tactical success, Enrique achieves strategic coup. Captures high-ranking Granada official coordinating raids, or turns major raider commander who defects with intelligence, or discovers Granada's communication network and rolls up entire operation. Raiding completely eliminated. PLUS actionable intelligence about Granada's main defenses or Moroccan aid timeline. Changes war's trajectory.\n\n\n99-100: Legendary Victory - Perfect storm. Enrique's campaign becomes textbook counter-insurgency operation. Total destruction of Granada's raiding capacity (1,500+ killed/captured), captures enemy leadership, local Muslim population in controlled areas begins actively supporting Christians against raiders. Zero significant casualties. Morale triumph inspires entire army. Enrique's reputation rivals Juan's. Granada demoralized.\n\n\n\nGM Assessment:\n\n\nMost Likely Range (41-78, 38% probability): Solid to good success. Enrique has significant advantages—superior numbers, shrinking enemy operational space, funds and expertise. Counter-raiding is hard, but his resources and aggressive approach should achieve meaningful results.\n\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\n\n3,000 cavalry vs. 1,500-2,500 scattered raiders\n\nExpert scouts and Arabic-speaking informants\n\nFinancial resources for intelligence\n\nAggressive, capable commander\n\nGranada's space contracting with every fortress captured\n\nCan coordinate with fixed garrisons\n\nCrusade momentum favors Christian side\n\n\nComplicating Factors:\n\n\nRaiders are experienced frontier fighters (200 years practice)\n\nLocal population may sympathize with Muslims\n\nGuerrilla warfare inherently difficult\n\nRaiders can scatter and hide\n\nIntelligence network needs time to develop\n\nSummer heat affects operations\n\nSome ambush risk for Enrique's patrols\n\n\nRealistic Expectation: Enrique should significantly reduce raiding effectiveness (50-70% reduction) and kill/capture hundreds of raiders. May not eliminate all of them in 30 days, but should make raiding much more dangerous and costly for Granada. Most likely outcome: 400-800 enemy casualties, raids cut by half or more, Enrique's losses under 100.\n\n\nRoll d100 when ready and I'll narrate Enrique's hunting campaign and its results."

Dawn comes early; you're riding again by first light.\n\n\nThe second day brings you through the pass and down into more familiar territory. The land opens up. By late afternoon of August 12th, you see Jaén rising on its hill—walls, towers, cathedral spire catching the sun. The gateway fortress to Granada, now your headquarters for the eastern command.\n\n\nThe garrison commander meets you at the gates, surprise evident on his face. \"Your Majesty! We received no word you were coming.\"\n\n\nYou dismount, road-weary and dust-covered. \"Dispatch riders should arrive tomorrow with details. Prepare quarters for my staff. I'll be here for some weeks.\"\n\n\nInside the fortress, servants scramble to make the royal apartments presentable. Diego, your secretary, arrives hours later with the baggage train. By evening, you're established—maps spread in the command room, courier stations organized.\n\n\nJaén. Central, secure, well-supplied.

Let me calculate: February to August is about 6 months, so she could be 5-6 months along, which would definitely be showing.\n\nIsabel's character: plain appearance, conventionally pious, not politically minded, found connection with Juan through shared faith.

Then transition back to military/strategic matters when appropriate\n\nIsabel's character: Plain, conventionally pious, not politically minded, but has developed genuine partnership with Juan through shared faith. She would be relieved and emotional at his return, grateful for his embrace, and would want to hear about his experiences while sharing her own quieter life in Jaén.\n\nThis is a good moment to humanize Juan and show the personal side of the crusade - the young king at war, his young pregnant wife waiting and praying. But I shouldn't drag it out too long since the player will want to get back to strategic matters.\n\n\nIsabel melts into your embrace, her head against your chest. You feel her shoulders shake slightly—relief, emotion, the weight of months worrying alone. \"Thank you,\" she whispers. \"Thank you for coming back.\"\n\n\nWhen she pulls away, she wipes her eyes quickly, embarrassed at the display. \"Forgive me. I promised myself I would be strong when you returned, not weep like a child.\"\n\n\nShe leads you to the private chambers—simpler than Toledo's royal apartments, but comfortable. Servants bring wine, bread, cheese. Isabel dismisses them, wanting privacy. She settles into a chair, arranging her skirts over the slight swell of her belly, and looks at you expectantly.\n\n\n\"You first,\" she says, with a small smile. \"I have heard reports from messengers—Málaga fallen, fortresses captured, great victories. But I want to hear it from you. What was it like? Were you...\" She hesitates. \"Were you in danger?\"\n\n\nHer hands fold in her lap, those serious eyes fixed on you. The girl who married you five months ago for political alliance, who found connection through shared faith, who has spent two months alone in a frontier fortress praying for your safety while carrying your child.\n\n\nOutside the window, Jaén's evening bells ring for vespers. The familiar sound of daily prayers marking the hours.\n\n\nWhat do you tell her about the campaign?"

It's only been 2-3 days, so there wouldn't be much news yet - he'd still be assembling forces, setting up his intelligence network, beginning initial patrols.

She's also probably been feeling isolated in Jaén, a frontier fortress.\n\nShe'd be torn between:\n1. Wanting to stay with Juan as long as possible\n2. Knowing Toledo is better for the baby\n3. Fear of being separated again\n4. Relief at having better care for the birth\n\nShe's practical and dutiful, but also emotionally attached to Juan now. She'd probably accept the necessity while feeling the pain of another separation.\n\n\nIsabel's expression shifts—relief mixed with sadness. \"Toledo. Yes, that would be...\" She pauses, her hand moving to her belly. \"That would be wise. The donnas are right, aren't they? Better physicians, proper midwives, the royal apartments. Everything a queen should have for her first child.\"\n\n\nShe looks down at their joined hands. \"But it means leaving you. Again.\" Her voice is small. \"I just got you back.\"\n\n\nA moment of silence, then she straightens, gathering her composure. \"I'm sorry. That was childish. Of course I should go to Toledo when the time comes. The baby's safety must come first, and I cannot be a burden to you during the campaign.\" She manages a smile. \"And you said we might have weeks together here first? That's more than I dared hope.\"\n\n\nShe squeezes your hand. \"When you must leave for war, I'll leave for Toledo immediately. The donnas can have everything ready. That way...\" Her voice wavers slightly. \"That way we part at the same time. You to your duty, me to mine.\"\n\n\nThere's a knock at the door—the donnas with breakfast.\n\n\nIsabel wipes her eyes quickly. \"I won't waste our time together being sad about what comes after. Every day is a gift.\" She touches your face. \"Will you tell me about the campaigns? What you're planning? I want to understand your work, even if I cannot share it with you.\""

He's feeding her bread while explaining military matters. She's pregnant, they're having breakfast together, and there's an intimacy here that goes beyond their initial political marriage. I should portray Isabel listening, reacting to the military information, and responding to this gentle care he's showing her.\n\nHe's explaining:\n- The raids and Enrique's counter-raiding task\n- Taking all the ports\n- Nothing left to do unless the Sultan moves a grand army west\n- He'd have to move immediately if that happens but doesn't expect it\n\nIsabel would be interested in this, trying to understand, but also just enjoying being with him. The act of him feeding her bread is very intimate and caring.\n\n\nIsabel accepts the bread from your fingers, chewing thoughtfully as she listens. The intimacy of the gesture—you feeding her like this—brings a flush to her cheeks, but she doesn't pull away. Instead, she leans into it, letting you care for her.\n\n\n\"Enrique hunting the raiders,\" she says between bites. \"That's dangerous work, isn't it? Not like pitched battles where you can see the enemy.\" She accepts another piece of bread. \"But he's proven himself loyal. I remember how you gave him that second chance after the rebellion.\"\n\n\nWhen you mention taking the ports, her eyes brighten with understanding. \"You're strangling them. Like... like cutting off the limbs before striking the heart.\" She looks pleased with herself for grasping the strategy. \"No ports means no trade, no reinforcements from across the sea. Granada becomes an island.\"\n\n\nShe sips wine diluted with water—the donnas' insistence for the pregnancy. \"And you truly think the Sultan won't attack? After losing so much?\" There's no challenge in her question, just genuine curiosity. \"What does a desperate man do when he has nothing left to lose?\"\n\n\nYou offer her more bread and she takes it, catching your fingers briefly with her lips. \"I hope you're right. I hope he stays behind his walls and lets you finish this season in peace.\" A pause. \"Then you could stay with me longer.\"\n\n\nShe knows it's selfish to say it, but she says it anyway, looking at you with those serious eyes. \"Is that terrible? To pray the enemy does nothing so my husband stays safe with me?\""

      "say": "Thought process: Orchestrated peaceful interlude before military crisis disrupts romance.\n\nThe user wants to fast-forward through time spent with Isabel until a crisis emerges that requires Juan's attention. Based on our earlier rolls:\n\n1. Infante Enrique's counter-raiding campaign: Rolled 6 - \"Campaign Failure\" - Major disaster. Raiders ambush one of his columns, inflicting heavy casualties (150-250 men). Intelligence network compromised. Raiders become more effective, emboldened. Enrique forced to adopt defensive posture. Losses to raiding actually increase.\n\n2. Master of Santiago's western campaign: Rolled 17 - \"Modest Progress with Difficulties\" - Takes Marbella after week-long siege but faces resistance. Granada harassment effective. Second objective either still under siege or bypassed. Captures 1-2 positions total. Casualties moderate (250-400).\n\n3. Sultan's strategy: Rolled 86 - \"Major Foreign Aid Appeal\" - Sends massive embassy to Morocco and North Africa.\n\n4. Success of foreign aid: Rolled 52 - \"Modest Success\" - Morocco commits 2,000-3,000 troops arriving late autumn/winter, plus 120,000 dinars arriving September.\n\n5. Sultan's operational strategy while waiting: Rolled 57 - \"Active Harassment Campaign\" - Deploys 1,500-2,500 troops for systematic raiding.\n\nSo the crisis that will call Juan away should be Enrique's campaign failure. This is a major setback that would require Juan's direct attention - heavy casualties, compromised intelligence network, emboldened raiders.\n\nLet me narrate the peaceful days with Isabel, then the arrival of the bad news about Enrique's disaster.\n\n\nDays of Peace - August 13-25, 1431\n\n\nThe days pass in unexpected tranquility. You wake with Isabel each morning, share meals, walk the fortress walls in the evening when the heat breaks. She shows you the cathedral where she's been praying—the bishop has allowed her a small side chapel for Portuguese devotions. You attend vespers together, your wife's voice soft beside you in Latin prayers.\n\n\nShe talks about the baby—what names she likes, whether it will be a boy or girl, how she imagines teaching a daughter to pray or a son to ride. You tell her stories of your childhood, your father, the sword you carry. She listens with rapt attention, learning you as you learn her.\n\n\nThe donnas fuss appropriately. Diego brings reports daily—nothing urgent. The Master of Santiago continues grinding westward. Don Álvaro de Estúñiga holds the defensive line. Routine dispatches, routine war.\n\n\nIsabel blooms. The worry lines fade from her face. She laughs more easily, touches you more freely. At night, you hold her as she falls asleep, her hand always resting on the growing curve of her belly.\n\n\n\"I wish it could always be like this,\" she whispers one evening. \"Just us, in peace.\"\n\n\nYou know it can't last.\n\n\n\nAugust 25th - Morning\n\n\nYou're breaking fast with Isabel when Captain Fernán enters, his face grim. \"Your Majesty. Urgent dispatch from Don Rodrigo de Perea. Rider pushed his horse near to death getting here.\"\n\n\nIsabel's hand tightens on her cup. She knows that look.\n\n\nYou break the seal. Don Rodrigo's handwriting is rushed, the ink smeared in places:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty—\n\n\nDisaster. Infante Enrique's force ambushed August 23rd in hill country west of Loja. Granada raiders laid trap—appeared to flee, led 800 of Enrique's cavalry into narrow valley. Main raider force (400-500) hit from high ground with bows, then closed for melee when our men tried to withdraw. Massacre in confined space.\n\n\nCasualties: 187 dead, 143 wounded (many seriously). Enrique lives but wounded—arrow in shoulder, still commands. Lost 40 horses, supplies, and worse—they captured or killed most of our Arabic-speaking scouts and informants. Our intelligence network destroyed.\n\n\nEnrique pulled back to defensive positions near Loja. Granada raiders emboldened—attacks have INCREASED since the ambush. Hit supply convoy yesterday, 35 more dead. They smell blood.\n\n\nMorale shaken. Men fear the raiders now. Enrique requests reinforcements and your presence—says the counter-raiding mission has failed and needs your direct command to salvage.\n\n\nI recommend immediate response. This could unravel if not contained. - Don Rodrigo\"\n\n\nIsabel has gone pale, watching your face as you read. \"What's happened?\"\n\n\nCaptain Fernán stands ready. \"Your Majesty, I can have your guard mounted within the hour.\"\n\n\nWhat are your orders?"

She's 15, pregnant, just had these precious days with Juan, and now he has to leave for war again. She can either:\n\n1. Stay in Jaén and hope he returns quickly (risky - what if the campaign drags on? She'd be stuck in a frontier fortress)\n2. Leave for Toledo immediately (safe, practical, but means definitely not seeing him for months)\n\nGiven her character:\n- She's dutiful and tries to do the right thing\n- She's young and emotional, especially now with pregnancy\n- She's been scared and lonely the past months\n- She just got comfortable with him\n- She's conventionally pious and tries to be a \"good wife\"\n- She's not politically minded but understands basic realities\n\nI think she would struggle with this decision. Part of her wants to cling to any chance of seeing him again soon. But the donnas have told her Toledo is safer, and she knows being practical is her duty. She's also probably scared that if she stays and he doesn't come back quickly, she'll be giving birth in a frontier fortress.\n\nI think she'd choose Toledo, but it would hurt her to do it. She'd be torn, maybe cry, but ultimately do the \"right\" thing.\n\n\nIsabel's face crumples. She sets down her cup with trembling hands. \"You're leaving. Now.\" It's not a question.\n\n\nShe stands abruptly, turning away from you toward the window, one hand pressed to her mouth. Her shoulders shake slightly. When she turns back, tears stream down her face but her voice is steady.\n\n\n\"I should go to Toledo. Immediately.\" She says it like pulling out a splinter—quick and painful. \"The donnas are right. If I stay here hoping you'll return quickly and you don't... if the campaign drags on and I'm still here in November, December...\" Her hand goes to her belly. \"I cannot give birth in a frontier fortress waiting for a husband who might not come.\"\n\n\nShe wipes her eyes angrily. \"I'm sorry. I promised myself I wouldn't cry when this moment came.\" She steps closer, taking your hands. \"You must go save Enrique. Fix what went wrong. Win your war. And I must go to Toledo and...\" Her voice breaks. \"And wait. Pray. Grow heavy with child. Prepare to bring your son or daughter into the world without you there.\"\n\n\nShe pulls you into a fierce embrace, her face against your chest. \"I knew this would happen. I knew from the moment you arrived that I'd have only days. But knowing doesn't make it easier.\"\n\n\nShe pulls back, composing herself with visible effort. \"Go. Now. Don't wait for me to stop crying because I won't.\" She manages a watery smile. \"I'll be strong once you're gone. But right now, let me be weak just a moment longer.\"\n\n\n\"When will you leave for Toledo?\" you ask.\n\n\n\"Today. This afternoon.\" Her voice firms. \"The donnas said we should be ready. We are ready. You ride south to war, I ride north to safety.\" She touches your face one last time. \"Come back to me, Juan. Come back and meet your child.\""
