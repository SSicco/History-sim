The Council of Basel delegation has been concluded\n3. Juan is assembling troops for sieges near Seville in March\n4. Isabel is recovering (from childbirth - she gave birth to their daughter in the previous chapter)\n5. Isabel's mother (Queen Leonor of Portugal) is on her way to visit\n6. Juan has had Álvaro fetch the founding legal documents of the military orders to review whether they can be put under crown command after the crusade\n\nLet me search the project knowledge to understand the current state of affairs, particularly:\n- The current date\n- Isabel's condition\n- The military situation\n- The status of the military orders\n- Any other relevant context\n\nI should start by setting the scene for this chapter and having Álvaro present the documents Juan requested. This creates an opportunity for strategic discussion and planning while also giving space for the ongoing personal storyline with Isabel's recovery and her mother's impending arrival.\n\nI need to be careful to:\n- NOT write Juan's dialogue or actions\n- Keep responses relatively short (2-4 paragraphs during active scenes)\n- Stop when Juan needs to respond or make decisions\n- Narrate the world's reactions to Juan's stated actions\n- Track dates and maintain continuity\n\nLet me search for the most recent chapter information to understand where we are.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process\n\nGood, I have context. Let me search for more information about the military orders and their founding documents, as well as the current status with Isabel's mother arriving.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Gathered contextual details to orient within narrative progression.\n\nPerfect. I have comprehensive context now. Let me search for more recent information about the current state (Chapter 32) to see exactly where we are.\n\n\nTool: Searching project\n\n\nThought process: Orchestrated scene setup for military order document review session.\n\nExcellent. Now I have a very clear picture. Let me summarize what I know:\n\n**Current State (Chapter 33):**\n- Late February 1432\n- The Council of Basel delegation has concluded and will depart in early March\n- Juan is still in Toledo, assembling troops for the Seville campaign against rebel nobles (Baron de Medina and Count of Niebla)\n- Isabel is recovering from childbirth (gave birth to daughter Catalina in late January)\n- Queen Leonor of Portugal (Isabel's mother) is on her way to help with Isabel's recovery\n- Juan has asked Álvaro to fetch the founding legal documents of the military orders (Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara) to review if they can be put under crown command after the crusade ends\n\nThe player wants to review these military order documents with Álvaro. This is a strategic planning session focused on long-term institutional control after the Granada crusade concludes.\n\nI should:\n1. Have Álvaro arrive with the documents\n2. Present the founding charters and their key provisions\n3. Discuss the legal and strategic implications\n4. Stop frequently to let Juan respond and make decisions\n5. Keep it relatively concise (this is a planning/document review session, not a dramatic scene)\n\nI should NOT:\n- Write Juan's dialogue or decisions\n- Suggest what Juan should do\n- Make the response too long - stop frequently for player input\n\nLet me start the scene with Álvaro arriving with the documents.\n\n\nChapter 33: The Military Orders Question\n\n\nLate February 1432, Toledo Alcázar\n\n\n\nÁlvaro de Luna arrives in your private study carrying a leather document case worn smooth with age. He's accompanied by two clerks bearing additional scrolls and bound volumes. The afternoon light streams through the high windows, illuminating dust motes in the air.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Álvaro says, setting the case on your desk with a satisfying thud. \"The founding charters and bulls. We retrieved them from Toledo Cathedral, the royal library, and sent riders to the chapter houses of all three Orders. These are either originals or certified copies.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to the clerks, who begin laying out documents with reverent care. Parchments yellow with age, papal seals dangling from silk cords, Latin script in the formal hand of twelfth-century scribes.\n\n\n\"It took some persuasion to get the Orders to cooperate,\" Álvaro continues, a slight smile playing at his lips. \"The Master of Santiago was cooperative—he trusts you now. Calatrava complied readily. Alcántara was... reluctant. I had to remind them this was royal business under crusade authority.\"\n\n\nHe picks up the oldest-looking document, handling it carefully. \"This is the bull for Calatrava, the first founded. Pope Alexander III, 1164. Fascinating reading, actually.\" He pauses, looking at you directly. \"Your instinct was correct. The implications are... significant.\""

If so, their function would cease when Granada falls.\n\nThis is a key strategic moment. Juan is looking for legal grounds to either:\n1. Dissolve the orders and seize their lands\n2. Transform them under crown authority\n3. Redirect them to eternal crusade in Africa\n\nI need to:\n- Have Álvaro explain what the documents actually say\n- Be historically accurate about 12th century military order charters\n- Show the legal implications\n- Present options without deciding for Juan\n- Keep it short (during active conversation)\n- Stop after Álvaro explains and wait for Juan's response\n\nThe documents would likely say things like:\n- Purpose: \"defense of Christendom against the Saracen/Moors\"\n- \"Fighting the infidel in the Spanish kingdoms\"\n- \"Protection of pilgrims and Christian territories\"\n- Very specific to Iberian Reconquista\n- No dissolution clause (they assumed it would take centuries or never happen)\n- Authority from Pope, not crown\n\nThis creates a legal vulnerability Juan can exploit.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods, setting down the Calatrava bull and picking up another. \"Precisely that. Let me read you the relevant passages.\"\n\n\nHe adjusts the parchment toward the light. \"From Pope Alexander III's bull establishing Calatrava in 1164: 'For the defense of the Church and the expulsion of the Saracen nation from the confines of the Spanish kingdoms... to fight manfully against the Moors who occupy Christian lands...'\"\n\n\nHe sets it down and picks up the Santiago charter. \"Santiago, 1170. Pope Alexander III again: 'To defend the Church of God against the Moors and pagans who occupy the Spanish territories... for the recovery of lands held by the infidel in the kingdoms of Spain...'\"\n\n\nOne more document. \"Alcántara—originally San Julián del Pereiro—1156, confirmed by Pope Alexander III in 1177: 'To war against the enemies of Christ dwelling in the Spanish lands... to protect pilgrims and Christians from Moorish depredations in Iberia...'\"\n\n\nÁlvaro looks up, his expression carefully neutral. \"Every single charter specifies Spain. Iberia. The Spanish kingdoms. Not 'fight the infidel wherever found' or 'defend Christendom generally.' Very specifically: expel the Moors from these lands.\"\n\n\nHe taps the documents. \"And none—not one—contains a dissolution clause. They simply assumed the Reconquista would continue for centuries. Possibly forever.\" He pauses. \"They never imagined a king would actually finish it.\"\n\n\n\"Which creates a fascinating legal problem.\" Álvaro begins pacing, his mind clearly working through the implications. \"When Granada falls and there are no more Moors in the Spanish kingdoms to fight... what happens to Orders whose entire purpose was fighting Moors in the Spanish kingdoms?\"\n\n\nHe turns back to you. \"Either their purpose is fulfilled and they should dissolve, returning their estates to the Church or Crown... or they need new charters with new purposes, which would require papal approval—and potentially crown oversight in their drafting.\"\n\n\nWhat do you say?"

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed multiple pathways to subordinate military orders under royal crusade authority.\n\nThis is an excellent strategic question from Juan. He's seeing the opportunity to convert the military orders from semi-independent papal entities into permanent royal military assets. This is historically what happened in various ways - Spain eventually did bring the military orders under crown control, though through different methods and timelines.\n\nLet me think through the options Álvaro would present:\n\n1. **Redirect to Eternal Crusade** - Keep them as crusading orders but fighting outside Iberia under Juan's direction\n2. **Argue for Crown Masterships** - King holds the mastership positions permanently\n3. **New Charters Incorporating Crown Authority** - Redefine their purpose with built-in royal oversight\n4. **Full Integration into Crown Military** - Most aggressive, essentially nationalizing them\n\nThe key issues:\n- Papal authority vs. crown authority\n- The Orders' own interests and honor\n- Legal/theological justification\n- Timing (must be done while Juan still has crusade authority)\n- Precedent and what other kingdoms might think\n\nÁlvaro would be excited about this but also cautious about the execution. He'd want to think through the arguments carefully.\n\nThe legal hook is strong: their purpose is literally fulfilled when Granada falls. Either they dissolve or transform. Juan has leverage because:\n1. He's finishing what they were founded to do\n2. He has papal favor and crusade authority\n3. He's proposing continued service to the Church (not secularization)\n4. Current masters are loyal to him\n\nBut there are risks:\n- Overreach could alienate the Pope\n- Orders might resist loss of independence\n- Sets precedent other kingdoms could use\n- Nobility might see it as crown power grab\n\nI should have Álvaro lay out multiple paths with pros/cons, then discuss which seems most viable. The eternal crusade angle is probably the best bet - it preserves the Orders' identity and purpose while establishing crown direction. Full crown control might be a bridge too far for Rome.\n\n\nÁlvaro stops pacing, his eyes gleaming with the kind of predatory intelligence you've come to recognize when he sees a strategic opportunity. He returns to the desk, fingers drumming on the ancient parchments.\n\n\n\"Now we're talking about something truly extraordinary,\" he says quietly. \"Transforming three papal military orders into permanent instruments of the Crown.\" He meets your eyes. \"It's ambitious. But Your Majesty... I think it's possible.\"\n\n\nHe pulls a clean sheet of paper toward him, dipping a quill. \"Let me outline the approaches, from most conservative to most aggressive.\"\n\n\n\n\"First option: The Eternal Crusade Redirection.\"\n\n\nHe begins writing as he speaks. \"Argue to the Pope that the Orders' purpose isn't finished—it's expanding. The Moors aren't defeated, merely expelled from Iberia. They still threaten Christendom from North Africa and the East. The Ottomans are at Constantinople's gates. The Hussites threaten Bohemia.\"\n\n\n\"The legal argument: Since their charters specify fighting 'enemies of Christ' and 'infidels,' and since Your Majesty is leading a papal crusade that will continue beyond Iberia, the Orders should naturally continue serving under your command as they have during the Granada campaign.\"\n\n\n\"Advantages: Preserves the Orders' identity and honor. They're still crusading, still serving their original purpose—just in new lands. Presents as continuation rather than transformation. Rome might accept this more readily.\"\n\n\n\"Disadvantages: Doesn't give you direct control of their estates or guarantee permanent obedience. They're still technically papal entities, just serving your crusade. When the eternal crusade ends—if it ever does—the question resurfaces.\"\n\n\n\n\"Second option: Permanent Crown Masterships.\"\n\n\n\"More aggressive. Argue that since Your Majesty has successfully appointed Masters during the crusade, and since the Orders' Iberian purpose is fulfilled, the Pope should grant you—and your heirs—permanent authority to appoint Masters.\"\n\n\n\"The precedent exists: the Knights of Malta's Grand Master is appointed with consultation from secular rulers. The Teutonic Knights have had various arrangements with German princes.\"\n\n\n\"Advantages: You control who leads them, which effectively controls the Orders. Doesn't require dissolving or fully nationalizing them—they remain papal military orders, but with royal appointment power. This is probably sustainable long-term.\"\n\n\n\"Disadvantages: Rome might balk at permanent hereditary appointment power. Sets a precedent other kings might demand. Doesn't give you direct control over estates or revenues—Masters could still theoretically defy you, though they'd be unlikely to if you appointed them.\"\n\n\n\n\"Third option: New Charters with Dual Authority.\"\n\n\n\"Most complex but potentially most stable. Work with the Pope to issue new bulls that explicitly incorporate crown oversight while maintaining papal foundation. Something like: 'For the continued defense of Christendom under the direction of the Crown of Castile...'\"\n\n\n\"Frame it as a partnership: Rome provides spiritual authority and legitimacy, Castile provides direction and purpose. The Orders become instruments of both Church and Crown.\"\n\n\n\"Advantages: Creates clear legal framework that satisfies both Rome and Castile. Preserves the Orders' religious character while establishing your authority. Could even make their continued tax exemptions conditional on crown service.\"\n\n\n\"Disadvantages: Requires extensive negotiation with Rome. Might drag on for years. Other aspects of the arrangement could get tangled up in broader Church politics.\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down the quill and looks at you seriously.\n\n\n\"The fourth option—full incorporation into the Crown military, essentially nationalizing them—I wouldn't recommend. Too aggressive, would provoke Rome unnecessarily, and honestly we don't need to go that far.\"\n\n\nHe taps the paper. \"My recommendation? Pursue options one and two simultaneously. Start with the eternal crusade argument—get them committed to serving under your command in the wars to come. Then, before the eternal crusade formally begins, negotiate for permanent crown appointment of Masters.\"\n\n\n\"The sequence matters: First establish that they're continuing their crusading purpose under you. Then lock in your control over leadership. Do both while you still have crusade authority and maximum papal favor.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward. \"The beauty is that your commitment to fight in Bohemia and defend Constantinople actually strengthens the argument. You're not trying to turn them into a royal police force. You're proposing they continue their sacred mission—fighting enemies of Christ—just under your command since you're the one actually organizing these crusades.\"\n\n\n\"The current Masters—Don Luis, Don Pedro—they'll support this if approached correctly. Frame it as honor and continued purpose, not subjugation. 'The Orders that finished the Reconquista will now defend all Christendom.' It's glorious, not degrading.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"But we need to move carefully. This conversation should happen with Rome after Granada falls but before the formal Te Deum and consecration. That narrow window when the crusade is won but not yet officially concluded. That's when you have maximum leverage and minimum time for opposition to organize.\"\n\n\n\"And Your Majesty?\" Álvaro's expression is intent. \"Never say 'place them under my command directly.' Always frame it as 'continue serving the Church's crusade under royal direction' or 'partnership between papal authority and royal leadership.' The substance is the same, but the presentation matters enormously.\"\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this approach?"

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed imperial ambitions against medieval political realities and precedents.\n\nThis is a fascinating question. Juan is essentially proposing something like what would eventually happen with the Spanish Empire under the Habsburgs, but he's thinking about it in 1432.\n\nLet me think about Álvaro's likely response:\n\n1. It's ambitious but not impossible - the Holy Roman Empire exists as a model\n2. Would require papal approval/coronation \n3. Would need to unite the Spanish kingdoms first (Aragon, Navarre, Portugal)\n4. Marriage alliances would be key\n5. Military strength from Granada conquest gives leverage\n6. Timing matters - need to consolidate power first\n\nÁlvaro would be honest but also strategic. He'd see both the opportunity and the immense challenges. He'd likely:\n- Take the question seriously (Juan has proven himself)\n- Point out the practical obstacles\n- Discuss precedents and requirements\n- Consider the Portuguese angle specifically\n- Think about Aragon and Navarre\n- Consider papal politics\n- Discuss timing and sequencing\n\nThis is a legitimate medieval political concept - the idea of creating an empire wasn't strange. The Holy Roman Empire existed. The Byzantine Empire existed. The question is whether it's achievable for Castile.\n\nÁlvaro would be thoughtful and honest.\n\n\nÁlvaro goes very still. For a long moment he simply looks at you, and you can see his mind working behind his eyes—not dismissing the idea, but turning it over like a jeweler examining a stone to see if it's genuine.\n\n\nFinally, he sets down the quill and sits in the chair opposite your desk.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says quietly, \"that is not a small question.\"\n\n\nHe steeples his fingers, choosing words carefully. \"An empire. A Spanish Empire uniting all the crowns of Iberia under imperial authority while preserving their individual kingdoms...\" He pauses. \"It's not impossible. But let me be completely honest about what it would require.\"\n\n\n\n\"First: Precedent and legitimacy.\"\n\n\n\"The Holy Roman Empire provides the model—many kingdoms and principalities united under an imperial crown. The Emperor is also King of Germany, but the empire encompasses many other kingdoms. The Byzantine Empire functions similarly in the East.\"\n\n\n\"For you to claim an imperial title, you would need papal coronation. Only the Pope can create an emperor in Christendom. But...\" He leans forward. \"Your Majesty, you're in perhaps the strongest position any Spanish king has held in centuries to make such a request. You're leading a successful papal crusade. You've committed to defend Constantinople and potentially fight in Bohemia. You have direct papal favor.\"\n\n\n\"The question becomes: What would make Rome grant it?\"\n\n\n\n\"Second: Uniting the Spanish crowns.\"\n\n\n\"Currently we have four major crowns in Iberia: Castile, Aragon, Portugal, and Navarre. Smaller players like Granada—soon to be absorbed—don't matter for this discussion.\"\n\n\nHe counts on his fingers. \"To create a Spanish Empire, you need at least three of the four. Ideally all four, but three would suffice.\"\n\n\n\"Aragon is the most natural target. King Alfonso V is in Naples, obsessed with Italy. He has no male heir—his brother Juan is next in line. If Alfonso dies without sons, Aragon's succession becomes... flexible. Marriage alliances with Aragon have always been possible. Your mother was Aragonese.\"\n\n\n\"Portugal is actually the clever part of your proposal.\" Álvaro's eyes show respect. \"Most kings would want to conquer Portugal or absorb it into Castile. But you're suggesting something different—let Portugal remain a kingdom within an empire. King João keeps his crown, his autonomy in internal matters, but acknowledges imperial overlordship.\"\n\n\n\"That's... actually brilliant, Your Majesty. João's daughter is your wife. Your child will have Portuguese blood. If you approach him not as a conqueror but as a family member proposing a partnership—'Let us create something greater together'—he might actually agree. Especially if Portuguese autonomy is guaranteed.\"\n\n\n\"Navarre is weakest and most vulnerable. Caught between Castile, Aragon, and France. Could be absorbed through marriage or conquest relatively easily, though France would object.\"\n\n\n\n\"Third: The timing and sequence.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro stands, begins pacing again. \"This cannot happen immediately. The foundation must be laid carefully, in stages.\"\n\n\n\"Stage One (1432-1433): Finish Granada. Complete the Reconquista. This makes you the king who accomplished what centuries of Spanish kings could not. This is your foundation of legitimacy.\"\n\n\n\"Stage Two (1433-1435): Execute the eternal crusade successfully. Take North African ports or fight for Constantinople or march on Bohemia—whatever you choose. Prove you're not just a Spanish king but a defender of Christendom. Build international reputation.\"\n\n\n\"Stage Three (1435-1437): Begin marriage negotiations carefully. Your children need to marry strategically. Aragonese alliances, Portuguese connections, perhaps even a French or Imperial marriage for diplomatic cover. Build the web of family connections.\"\n\n\n\"Stage Four (1437-1440): Approach the Pope with the proposal. By then you'll have finished Granada, led multiple successful crusades, have the military Orders under your command, possess enormous prestige, and have family connections across Iberia. Request imperial coronation to formalize your leadership of a united Christian Spain.\"\n\n\nHe stops pacing. \"The key argument to Rome: 'A united Spanish Empire is the Church's bulwark against Islam. One strong power defending the southern flank of Christendom, capable of permanent crusade in Africa and the East, is better than four squabbling kingdoms.'\"\n\n\n\n\"Fourth: The practical obstacles.\"\n\n\n\"I won't lie to you, Your Majesty. The obstacles are formidable.\"\n\n\n\"Portugal might refuse. King João has no reason to subordinate himself unless you offer something irresistible. Perhaps: joint crusading profits, guaranteed autonomy, Portuguese naval dominance in any African conquests, marriage alliances that benefit both houses. You need to make him want this.\"\n\n\n\"Aragon is complicated by Alfonso's Naples obsession and potential French interference. They might fear Castilian dominance.\"\n\n\n\"France will object strenuously. They don't want a united Spain on their border. They'll pressure Rome to refuse.\"\n\n\n\"The Pope might worry about creating a power that rivals the Holy Roman Emperor or becomes too strong to control. You'd need to assure Rome this serves the Church's interests.\"\n\n\n\"Internal resistance: Castilian nobles might resist if they think you're diluting Castilian identity or creating new layers of authority above them. Would need to manage this carefully.\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro returns to his seat, looking at you with frank respect.\n\n\n\"But Your Majesty... the fact that you're thinking about this tells me something important. You're not content with just being a successful king. You're thinking about legacy, about building something that lasts.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"My honest assessment: It's possible, but it requires perfect execution over a decade or more. You can't rush this. Every step must be careful. But you have advantages no Spanish king has had in memory: papal favor, military success, the Orders under your control, marriage alliances, and youth—you have time to build this.\"\n\n\n\"The Portuguese angle is genuinely innovative. Most kings would try to conquer and absorb. You're proposing a federation under imperial authority. That might actually work, especially with family connections.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you seriously. \"Do I think you can do it? I think if anyone in this generation could, it's you. But it will take patience, diplomacy, continued military success, and very careful management of Rome, Portugal, and Aragon.\"\n\n\n\"Is it worth attempting?\" He spreads his hands. \"Your Majesty, if you succeed, you'll have created something unprecedented—a united Iberian power that could truly challenge Islam permanently, protect Christendom's southern border, and last for centuries. That's not a small ambition. But you've already accomplished what most thought impossible by planning to finish Granada before you're twenty.\"\n\n\nHe leans back. \"The question is: do you want to spend the next ten to fifteen years of your life building toward this? Because that's what it will take.\"\n\n\nWhat do you think?"

He's basically saying \"these are already my goals anyway, so the empire idea is just a natural extension of what I'm doing.\" Very pragmatic and patient. \n\nAnd he raises an interesting point about Aragon succession. Let me think about this:\n\n- Juan II of Castile's mother was Catherine of Lancaster, but actually wait - in this timeline, who was his mother? Let me check the project knowledge...\n\nActually, I should be careful here. The historical Juan II of Castile's mother was Catherine of Lancaster, daughter of John of Gaunt. But his father Fernando I (\"Fernando de Antequera\") was from the Trastámara dynasty and became King of Aragon. So the Infantes de Aragón are actually Juan's cousins or half-brothers depending on the exact relationship.\n\nThe current King of Aragon is Alfonso V (Alfonso the Magnanimous), who in real history was obsessed with Naples. The Infantes Juan and Enrique de Aragón who have been causing trouble are Alfonso's brothers.\n\nSo Juan II of Castile actually does have Aragonese blood through his father's line. If the Infantes are eliminated from succession (they're currently in line after Alfonso V), and if Alfonso dies without legitimate male heirs, Juan could potentially make a claim.\n\nThis is actually a really astute observation by the player. Let me have Álvaro recognize this and discuss the succession complexities.\n\nThe key thing is: Álvaro should be impressed by Juan's patience and strategic thinking, discuss the Aragonese succession situation realistically, and affirm that they're on the right path.\n\n\nÁlvaro's expression shifts—something like relief mixed with admiration. He actually laughs, a short, genuine sound.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, that is exactly the right answer.\" He shakes his head. \"I was worried you'd become fixated on the imperial title itself and start forcing the sequence. But you're right—finish Granada, lead the eternal crusade, build the Orders' loyalty, strengthen your position... these are all things you should do regardless. The empire becomes a natural culmination, not a distortion of your path.\"\n\n\nHe picks up his wine cup, takes a sip, then sets it down thoughtfully.\n\n\n\"And your point about Aragon...\" Álvaro's eyes narrow in calculation. \"Let me lay out the succession situation, because you're onto something significant.\"\n\n\n\n\"The Aragonese Succession\"\n\n\n\"Currently, King Alfonso V is childless. He's married to Maria of Castile—actually your cousin—but the marriage is cold. He's been in Naples for years, obsessed with his Italian conquests, and shows no signs of producing legitimate heirs.\"\n\n\n\"If Alfonso dies without sons, the crown passes to his brothers in order: first Infante Juan de Aragón, then Infante Enrique de Aragón—the same two who rebelled against you.\"\n\n\n\"Now here's where it gets interesting.\" Álvaro leans forward. \"Your father was Fernando I of Aragon—'Fernando de Antequera'—from the Trastámara line. He ruled Aragon before dying in 1416. Alfonso V, Juan, and Enrique are your father's sons by his wife Leonor of Alburquerque.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Which makes them your half-brothers, Your Majesty. Same father, different mothers. Your mother was Catherine of Lancaster; theirs was Leonor.\"\n\n\n\"So the current Aragonese royal line consists entirely of your father's sons. You share the same Trastámara blood, the same Aragonese connection through Fernando I.\"\n\n\n\n\"The Legal Complications\"\n\n\n\"The problem is primogeniture and legitimacy. Alfonso inherited Aragon because he was Fernando's eldest son by his marriage to Leonor. You were born to Catherine of Lancaster, but...\" He hesitates. \"The exact legal status is complicated. Were your parents married? Was it legitimate? These questions matter for succession claims.\"\n\n\n\"However.\" Álvaro's tone becomes more energized. \"If the Infantes are eliminated from succession—either through formal disinheritance for rebellion, or through other means—and if Alfonso dies without heirs, the line becomes murkier. Who inherits? The next closest male relative with Aragonese blood.\"\n\n\n\"That could be you, Your Majesty. Son of Fernando I, King of Castile, successful crusader, with Trastámara blood. Especially if you've built reputation, military success, and papal favor by then.\"\n\n\n\n\"The Strategic Sequence\"\n\n\n\"Here's how this could unfold naturally, without forcing anything:\"\n\n\n\"First: Deal with the Infantes' rebellion decisively. They've already failed once. After you finish Granada, their position becomes untenable. They either submit completely, are formally disinherited, or... other outcomes occur.\"\n\n\n\"Second: Alfonso continues his Naples obsession. He's forty-three now, shows no interest in his wife or producing heirs. Every year that passes without a son weakens his line.\"\n\n\n\"Third: You build your reputation across Christendom. Finish Granada. Lead successful crusades. Control the Military Orders. Become the Spanish king everyone respects.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth: If Alfonso dies childless and the Infantes are gone from succession, Aragon faces a crisis. Who inherits? The Cortes of Aragon would need to decide. And they might look at the successful, legitimate, crusading King of Castile who shares their royal blood and think: 'Perhaps a personal union with Castile, under Juan II, is better than civil war or a weak claimant.'\"\n\n\nÁlvaro spreads his hands. \"It wouldn't be conquest. It would be legitimate succession—or election by the Aragonese Cortes. And it provides exactly what you suggested: a way to unite the crowns while preserving Aragonese identity.\"\n\n\n\n\"The Portuguese Situation\"\n\n\n\"Portugal is different because you have no blood claim to their throne. But you have something better: family alliance through Isabel, and the possibility of partnership rather than subordination.\"\n\n\n\"If you approach King João after uniting Castile and Aragon—when you're already an enormously powerful monarch—and propose an imperial framework where Portugal keeps its autonomy, its overseas ambitions, its identity, but joins a greater Spanish federation... he might actually see the advantage. Especially if you offer joint crusading in Africa, protection from Castile's power, and guaranteed Portuguese independence within the structure.\"\n\n\n\"It's not subordination. It's partnership between royal houses, formalized through imperial authority.\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro sits back, looking at you with frank respect.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, the fact that you said 'let's just continue, we'll see what happens' tells me you understand something crucial: you can't force this kind of transformation. It has to emerge naturally from success, reputation, opportunity, and careful positioning.\"\n\n\n\"The Aragonese succession situation is a genuine opportunity. But it only works if: one, you're successful enough that Aragon wants you; two, the Infantes are gone from the picture; three, Alfonso dies without heirs; and four, you've built enough legitimacy that the Aragonese Cortes accepts you.\"\n\n\n\"None of that can be rushed. But all of it flows naturally from what you're already doing.\"\n\n\nHe picks up the old parchments again. \"So let's focus on what's in front of us: these Military Orders, finishing Granada, dealing with the rebel nobles, preparing for the eternal crusade. The rest will unfold as God wills.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, a slight smile. \"Though I'll note: if a King of Castile who also ruled Aragon and commanded three military orders approached the King of Portugal proposing an imperial federation... that's not a proposal João could dismiss lightly. That's a proposal from someone who could crush him if refused, but chooses partnership instead. That's compelling.\"\n\n\n\"But we're years away from that conversation. First things first: let's secure these Military Orders under your authority. That foundation matters for everything else.\"\n\n\nHe gestures to the documents. \"Shall we draft a preliminary plan for approaching Rome about the Orders' future after Granada falls? We have time to refine it, but starting the thinking now ensures we're ready when the moment comes.\"\n\n\nWhat do you want to do?"

I need to check the project files - the Infantes already renounced their claims. Let me search for this.\n\nLooking back at the summaries, I can see references to the Infantes being defeated, but I need to find the specific details about their renunciation of claims. The user is correcting me - they've already been eliminated from succession through formal renunciation.\n\nThis is an important correction. The Infantes de Aragón did surrender and renounce their claims. I was treating this as a future possibility when it's already accomplished. I need to have Álvaro acknowledge this mistake and correct his analysis accordingly.\n\nThis significantly changes the Aragonese succession situation - if Juan and Enrique have already renounced all claims for themselves and their descendants, then after Alfonso V (who is childless), the succession becomes very murky. Juan II of Castile would have a much stronger claim as the son of Fernando I of Aragon.\n\nI should have Álvaro acknowledge his error, apologize for the oversight, and then revise his analysis based on this crucial fact.\n\n\nÁlvaro stops mid-gesture, his face going blank for a moment. Then he closes his eyes and actually laughs—at himself.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, you are absolutely right. Forgive me.\" He sets down the parchments and looks at you directly. \"The Infantes renounced everything after their failed revolt. All titles, all claims, for themselves and all their descendants in perpetuity. I was there when they signed the documents. How could I forget something so fundamental?\"\n\n\nHe shakes his head ruefully. \"I think I've been so focused on current problems—Isabel's recovery, the rebel nobles, the Basel delegation—that I let my mind slip on what we've already accomplished.\"\n\n\nHe sits back down, his expression shifting from embarrassment to realization.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, if they've already renounced everything, then the Aragonese succession situation is far more favorable than I just described. Let me reconsider...\"\n\n\nHe counts on his fingers. \"Alfonso V is forty-three, childless, in Naples, shows no interest in producing heirs. If he dies without sons—which seems increasingly likely—and the Infantes have already eliminated themselves and their descendants from succession...\"\n\n\nÁlvaro looks up at you, understanding dawning. \"Then who inherits Aragon? The next closest male relative with legitimate Aragonese Trastámara blood. Which is you, Your Majesty. Son of Fernando I of Aragon, King of Castile, proven crusader.\"\n\n\nHe leans forward intently. \"This isn't some distant theoretical possibility. This is a genuine succession claim that could materialize within a decade, maybe sooner. Alfonso could die in Naples—he's constantly at war there. And when he does, you have a legitimate case for the Crown of Aragon.\"\n\n\n\"The Aragonese Cortes would face a choice: accept the King of Castile who finished the Reconquista and shares their royal blood, or find some distant cousin with a weaker claim and risk civil war.\"\n\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"Your Majesty, you don't need to create an empire artificially. You're already positioned to inherit the union of Castile and Aragon naturally, through legitimate succession. Everything you're doing—finishing Granada, leading crusades, building reputation—strengthens that claim for when the moment comes.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, looking at you with new respect. \"I apologize for the oversight. You're thinking more clearly about the strategic picture than I was. The Infantes are gone. The path is clearer than I realized.\"\n\n\n\"So yes—let's focus on the immediate tasks. Finish Granada, secure the Military Orders, lead the eternal crusade. The Aragonese succession will resolve itself when Alfonso dies, and you'll be in position to claim what is legitimately yours by blood and achievement.\"\n\n\nHe picks up the Military Orders documents again. \"And when you rule both Castile and Aragon, commanding three military orders with an eternal crusade underway... that's when you approach Portugal about an imperial federation. From overwhelming strength, but offering partnership.\"\n\n\n\"Forgive my lapse, Your Majesty. You're right to simply continue the path. The foundation is already stronger than I was giving credit for.\"\n\n\nWhat would you like to focus on now?"

Isabel would have received word that she's coming. Let me have Isabel respond about this, showing her relief and gratitude that her mother is coming, while also responding to Juan's comments about the rebel campaign.\n\nIsabel would understand Juan's reasoning about preventing bloodshed, but she's still anxious about him leaving. The mention of her mother would bring both comfort and emotion - she's been through so much and desperately wants her mother's presence.\n\n\nIsabel's expression softens at your words. \"I know you must go. And you're right—if your presence can prevent Castilian blood from being spilled, then it's worth the separation. These are your subjects, not foreign enemies. If Baron de Medina or the Count of Niebla see their king arrive with overwhelming force, perhaps they'll have the sense to surrender rather than die for pride.\"\n\n\nShe adjusts Catalina slightly, her movements still careful. \"I just...

Let me think about the factors:\n\n1. She's traveling from Portugal (likely Lisbon or another Portuguese court) to Toledo\n2. Distance is roughly 400-450km depending on route\n3. She's a queen traveling with physicians and likely a substantial retinue\n4. It's late February 1432 - winter/early spring, so weather could be a factor\n5. She's motivated by her daughter's near-death experience\n6. The letter arrived 3 days ago according to Isabel\n\nTimeline considerations:\n- Juan is leaving for Seville in \"a few more days\" - let's say 5-7 days\n- A royal retinue traveling at reasonable pace: 30-40km per day normally\n- Urgent travel with good conditions: 50km per day\n- Bad conditions or delays: 20km per day or less\n- So normal journey: 10-14 days\n- Fast journey: 8-10 days  \n- Delayed journey: 15-20+ days\n\nThe letter arrived 3 days ago. If she left immediately upon receiving news (which would have taken time to reach her), she's probably been traveling 5-10 days already by now.\n\nLet me create a table that considers:\n- How quickly she departed after receiving news\n- Weather and road conditions\n- Any complications or delays\n- Her pace of travel\n- When she actually arrives relative to Juan's departure\n\nI'll make it so:\n- Very low rolls (1-15): Significant delays, arrives well after Juan leaves\n- Low rolls (16-35): Some delays, arrives just after Juan leaves or the day he leaves\n- Mid-low (36-55): Normal travel, arrives 2-3 days before Juan leaves\n- Mid-high (56-75): Good travel, arrives 4-5 days before Juan leaves  \n- High (76-90): Very good conditions, arrives 6-7 days before Juan leaves\n\n\n- Very high (91-100): Exceptional speed, arrived already or arrives tomorrow\n\nFor the extreme high-end scenario, I'll factor in her royal status, urgent motivation, and potential for extraordinary travel arrangements. She might have pre-arranged relay horses, advance notice to local nobles for support, or take the most direct route possible. This could mean she's essentially sprinting across the Iberian Peninsula, driven by maternal concern and royal privilege.\n\n\nQueen Leonor of Portugal's Journey - d100 Table\n\n\nROLL 1-15: Significant Delays\nQueen Leonor departed Lisbon quickly upon receiving the news, but encountered serious complications. Heavy winter rains turned roads into mud, forcing the royal party to take longer routes through mountainous terrain. One of the wagons broke an axle crossing a swollen river, requiring two days for repairs. Several in her party fell ill from the harsh conditions, slowing progress further. She arrives 12-14 days after Juan's departure for Seville. Isabel must face the separation without her mother's immediate comfort.\n\n\nROLL 16-25: Weather Delays\nThe Queen departed promptly but faced persistent rain and poor road conditions throughout the journey. The royal retinue, including physicians and their equipment, moved slowly through muddy terrain. No major disasters, but steady delays accumulate. She arrives 4-6 days after Juan leaves. Close, but not quite in time for farewell.\n\n\nROLL 26-35: Just Missed\nTravel proceeded at normal winter pace with typical delays. The Queen maintained steady progress but the distance and season worked against speed. She arrives 1-2 days after Juan's departure, or possibly the very day he leaves in the morning. Isabel might get to see her mother briefly before Juan rides out, but no substantial time together as a family.\n\n\nROLL 36-50: Standard Arrival\nGood organization and decent weather allowed reasonable travel speed. Queen Leonor managed the journey competently, pushing when possible but not recklessly. She arrives 2-3 days before Juan leaves for Seville. Enough time for her to meet Catalina, assess Isabel's condition, speak with physicians, and have one meaningful conversation with Juan about Isabel's care during his absence.\n\n\nROLL 51-65: Good Timing\nThe Queen departed within a day of receiving news and encountered favorable conditions. Roads were passable, weather cooperated, and her retinue traveled efficiently. She arrives 4-5 days before Juan leaves. Sufficient time for Queen Leonor to thoroughly evaluate Isabel's recovery, meet her granddaughter properly, coordinate with Juan about Isabel's care, and provide Isabel meaningful comfort before the separation.\n\n\nROLL 66-80: Very Good Timing\nLeonor left immediately and pushed the pace whenever safe, aided by unusually good late February weather. The royal party made excellent time with minimal rest stops. She arrives 6-7 days before Juan leaves. Ample time for family bonding, for Leonor to establish her presence and support, to give Isabel strength before Juan's departure, and for substantive discussions about Isabel's health and future pregnancies.\n\n\nROLL 81-90: Excellent Speed\nThe Portuguese Queen, upon hearing of her daughter's near-death, departed with unusual haste and maintained punishing pace. Good weather, well-maintained roads on this route, and sheer determination saw the party covering 50km daily. She arrives 8-10 days before Juan leaves (meaning she could arrive as early as tomorrow or within 2-3 days). Maximum time together as extended family before the campaign.\n\n\nROLL 91-100: Already Here or Arrives Tomorrow\nQueen Leonor received advance warning before the official letter—perhaps a messenger Juan sent directly after the birth crisis, or Portuguese merchants brought word. She departed Portugal immediately, traveled with a small, fast group (leaving the slower baggage train to follow), and made exceptional time. She either arrived yesterday/today, or arrives tomorrow morning. Juan will have over a week with both Isabel and her mother present. Leonor has been at Isabel's bedside, Portuguese physicians already examining her, maternal support fully in place.\n\n\n\nWhen would you like to roll?"

Banners hang from the walls—the royal standard of Castile, the crusader's white banner, and the arms of the Crown Marshals' office. Perhaps sixty nobles and officials line the sides of the chamber, summoned to witness this first major test of the new justice system.\n\n\nAt the far end, you sit on the throne of Castile, crown on your head, your father's sword across your knees. To your right stands Álvaro de Luna. To your left, Archbishop Gutiérrez in full vestments. Behind you, the three Crown Marshals—Don Rodrigo de Perea, Don Fernando de Guzmán, and Don Luis de la Cerda—stand in their official tabards.\n\n\nThe symbolism is deliberate: royal authority, ecclesiastical authority, and the new enforcement system all present and unified.\n\n\nThe doors open. Don García de Sotomayor enters between two guards.\n\n\nHe's a man in his late fifties, gray-bearded, dressed simply but with dignity. Not in chains—he surrendered peacefully—but clearly in custody. He walks with his head up, neither defiant nor groveling. When he reaches the appropriate distance from the throne, he kneels.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says simply.\n\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea, the Crown Marshal who secured his surrender, steps forward and speaks in a clear voice that carries through the chamber:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I present Don García de Sotomayor, lord of estates in Extremadura. In November of 1431, at the Cortes of Valladolid, the assembled nobles and clergy of Castile approved the crusade taxation law. Don García de Sotomayor was present and heard these laws proclaimed.\"\n\n\n\"In December, assessment officials arrived at his estates to conduct the required audits. Don García refused them entry. When letters were sent explaining his obligations, he sent them back unopened. When I arrived as Crown Marshal with final warning, he barricaded himself in his manor house and declared he would pay no tax to any man, king or otherwise.\"\n\n\nRodrigo's voice hardens slightly. \"Only when I returned with two hundred men-at-arms and made clear that his estates would be taken by force did Don García surrender. He came peacefully, and no blood was shed. But for three months, he defied royal authority, defied the laws approved by Cortes, and defied the crusade itself.\"\n\n\nSilence in the chamber.\n\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez speaks next, his voice grave: \"Don García de Sotomayor stands excommunicated by decree of Cardinal Capranica for refusing to pay the holy tax approved by papal legate. His estates are forfeit to the Crown. His life is forfeit to Your Majesty's justice.\"\n\n\nThe Archbishop pauses. \"However, the law provides that those who submit to royal judgment may seek redemption through crusade service. Don García has surrendered peacefully. The question of mercy rests with Your Majesty.\"\n\n\nAll eyes turn to you.\n\n\nDon García remains kneeling, head bowed. He doesn't speak unless spoken to—he knows his position.\n\n\nThe chamber waits.\n\n\nWhat do you say to him? What sentence do you pronounce?"

To bow before papal bulls and royal decrees that treat nobles like subjects?\" He knows he's doomed anyway, might as well speak his mind. The chamber gasps at his insolence. He's forcing your hand toward the harshest sentence.\n\n\nROLL 11-25: Proud Resentment\nHe keeps his head bowed but his voice carries sharp edges. \"Your Majesty does me honor by asking. I will answer truthfully: I am a lord of Extremadura. My house has held these lands for two hundred years. We answer to the Crown, yes—but we are not merchants to be audited, not peasants to have our stores counted and taxed at another man's discretion.\" He's admitting no wrongdoing, merely explaining his noble prerogatives were violated. Respectful in form but resentful in substance. This makes reconciliation difficult.\n\n\nROLL 26-40: Cautious Defense\nHe remains kneeling, chooses words carefully. \"Your Majesty, I... I did not understand the full scope of the law at first. The language about assessments, about audits... it seemed an intrusion I was not prepared to accept. By the time I realized the seriousness—that it was not optional, that defiance meant excommunication—I had already sent the officials away. I confess I was stubborn. Too stubborn.\" Half-admission, half-justification. He's trying to minimize his guilt while acknowledging some error.Workable but requires you to press him.\n\n\nROLL 41-60: Honest Admission with Context\nHe looks up at you, meeting your eyes. \"Your Majesty, I will not lie to you. When those assessors arrived, I saw them as an insult. I am not a wealthy man—my estates are modest—but they are mine, held by my family since before the Infantes of Aragon were born. To have strangers demand to see my accounts, count my grain stores, assess my worth like property...\" He pauses. \"It felt like being reduced. Like my service, my blood given for Castile, meant nothing. I was wrong to refuse. I see that now. But at the time, all I felt was anger.\" Honest, vulnerable, admits wrongdoing while explaining his wounded pride. This is workable.\n\n\nROLL 61-75: Genuine Remorse\nHis voice shakes slightly. \"Your Majesty, I was a fool. A proud, stubborn fool who let his dignity matter more than his duty. When Don Rodrigo came with his final warning, when I saw two hundred men at my gates... I realized I had been treating this like a personal slight rather than royal law. I had risked my family's future, my people's safety, for pride.\" He looks directly at you. \"Your Majesty shows me more grace in this moment than I showed your officials. I cannot undo my defiance, but I beg the chance to redeem it. I am old, but not too old to serve. Let me earn back what I have lost.\" Clear remorse, genuine understanding of his error. Very workable.\n\n\nROLL 76-85: Emotionally Overwhelmed\nYour respectful address—calling him \"Don García,\" acknowledging his peaceful surrender, asking his perspective—visibly affects him. His composure cracks. \"Your Majesty, I... I expected a dungeon. Or worse. I expected to be made an example. Instead you...\" He has to stop, collect himself. \"I was wrong. Not just in law but in spirit. I heard about the crusade taxation and I thought: 'Another burden on nobles while the Crown grows stronger.' I didn't see it as holy war. I didn't see past my own resentment.\" His voice drops. \"But you're half my age and you speak to me with more honor than I showed your officials. That shames me more than excommunication.\" Genuine emotional reaction. Creates powerful moment.\n\n\nROLL 86-95: Calculated Humility\nHe reads the room expertly—sees your mercy as an opening, understands the political theater. \"Your Majesty, you ask what moved me, and I will answer with the honesty you deserve. I was afraid. Not of the tax itself—I could pay it—but of what it represented. Change. New systems. Royal authority reaching deeper into our estates than before.\" He pauses deliberately. \"I responded to fear with defiance, when I should have responded with faith—faith in Your Majesty's justice, faith in the crusade's purpose. Don Rodrigo's patience and your mercy have shown me the error. I ask only to serve the crusade I should have supported from the start.\" He's saying exactly what you want to hear, skillfully. It's genuine enough, but also calculated. Still workable.\n\n\nROLL 96-100: Complete Transformation\nYour words—especially acknowledging that his peaceful surrender \"describes him as someone who shoulders responsibility\"—strike something deep. He looks up at you with an expression that's almost bewildered. \"Your Majesty... do you truly see my surrender that way? As taking responsibility?\" His voice is thick. \"I saw it as admitting defeat. As having no choice. But you...\" He stops, visibly struggling. \"I refused your officials because I thought I was protecting something—my dignity, my house's honor. But watching Don Rodrigo's men at my gates, knowing my stubbornness had brought them there, knowing my people would suffer if I fought... I realized I was protecting nothing but pride.\" He bows his head fully. \"Your Majesty calls me one who shoulders responsibility. I pray to become worthy of that description. All I ask is the chance to serve the crusade I denied. To die for something greater than my own wounded pride.\" Profound, genuine transformation. Rare but possible given your unexpected grace.\n\n\n\nRoll when ready."

This is a powerful outcome where Don García is genuinely affected by Juan's respectful treatment. He expected harsh judgment, chains, to be made an example - instead he gets addressed with dignity and asked for his perspective.\n\nKey elements from the table entry:\n- His composure cracks\n- He's visibly affected by being called \"Don García\" and having his peaceful surrender acknowledged positively\n- He admits he was wrong not just legally but spiritually\n- He confesses he didn't see past his own resentment about \"another burden on nobles\"\n- He didn't see it as holy war at first\n- The fact that Juan (half his age) shows him more honor than he showed Juan's officials shames him more than excommunication\n- This creates a genuine emotional moment\n\nI need to write this scene showing:\n1. His initial response starting to crack\n2. The emotional overwhelm building\n3. His genuine shame and remorse\n4. The contrast between what he expected and what he received\n5. His confession about his mindset\n6. The powerful moment this creates in the throne room\n\nThis should be realistic - a proud older noble who expected punishment instead receives dignified treatment and it breaks through his defenses. Not melodramatic, but genuinely moving.\n\n\nDon García de Sotomayor looks up at you, and for a moment he simply stares—as if your words haven't fully registered. His mouth opens, closes. He glances at the guards flanking him, then at the assembled nobles, then back to you.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I...\" His voice catches. He tries again. \"I expected a dungeon. Or worse. I expected to be made an example of—dragged before the court in chains, sentenced immediately, perhaps executed in the plaza to show what happens to those who defy the Crown.\"\n\n\nHe has to stop, his throat working. His hands, clasped before him, are trembling slightly.\n\n\n\"Instead you...\" He can't finish. Several heartbeats of silence. When he speaks again, his voice is rougher. \"Instead you call me by my name. You acknowledge that I came peacefully. You ask—you ask—what moved me. As if my perspective matters. As if I deserve to be heard after three months of defiance.\"\n\n\nOne of the older nobles in the gallery shifts uncomfortably. Several others exchange glances—this is not going the way anyone expected.\n\n\nDon García bows his head, and when he continues, the words come in a rush, like a dam breaking:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I was wrong. Not just in law—I know I violated the law, I know I defied papal authority and royal decree—but I was wrong in spirit. In my heart.\" He looks up again, meeting your eyes directly now, his own shining with unshed tears.\n\n\n\"When I heard about the crusade taxation at Valladolid, do you know what I thought? I thought: 'Another burden. Another way for the Crown to reach deeper into our coffers while royal power grows.' I saw tax assessors coming to count my grain stores and I thought: 'They're treating me like a merchant. Like a peasant to be audited and controlled.'\"\n\n\nHis voice drops, thick with shame. \"I didn't see it as holy war, Your Majesty. I didn't see past my own resentment. All those speeches about the crusade, about finishing the Reconquista, about serving God—I heard the words but I didn't hear them. I only saw what it would cost me.\"\n\n\nHe grips his hands together tighter. \"And then Don Rodrigo came with two hundred men. And I saw my people frightened, my household terrified, my servants begging me to surrender before blood was spilled. And I realized what my pride had done—what it had nearly done. I had risked everything, everyone who depended on me, for what? Because I didn't want strangers looking at my accounts?\"\n\n\nA single tear escapes, tracks down through his gray beard. His voice barely above a whisper now:\n\n\n\"But Your Majesty... you're half my age. I've served this kingdom for forty years, fought at Antequera, bled for Castile. And here you sit, not yet twenty, and you show me more honor—more grace—than I showed your officials who came peacefully to my gates with nothing but law and duty.\"\n\n\nHe bows his head fully. \"That shames me more than the excommunication. More than losing my estates. More than standing here before the court as a condemned man. You treat me like a noble when I behaved like a child. You ask my perspective when I deserve only judgment.\"\n\n\nThe silence in the throne room is absolute. Even Álvaro, usually so composed, is watching with an intent expression.\n\n\nDon García draws a shaking breath. \"I have no excuse, Your Majesty. Only the truth: I was afraid of change. Afraid of what the new laws meant, afraid of royal power growing, afraid of losing the world I knew. And I responded to that fear with stubbornness and pride instead of faith—faith in my king, faith in the crusade, faith that serving something greater than myself was worth any cost.\"\n\n\nHe raises his head one more time, his weathered face streaked with tears he's no longer trying to hide.\n\n\n\"You said my surrender shows I shoulder responsibility. I... I didn't see it that way. I saw it as admitting defeat. As having no other choice. But if Your Majesty sees it as something more than that...\" His voice breaks completely. \"Then I beg—I beg—for the chance to earn that judgment. To become worthy of that mercy. To serve the crusade I should have supported from the beginning. To die for God and Castile rather than for my own wounded pride.\"\n\n\nHe stays kneeling, head bowed, shoulders shaking slightly. A proud man, broken open by unexpected grace.\n\n\nThe throne room remains silent. Every eye is on you.\n\n\nWhat do you say?"

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed spiritual themes against practical succession concerns.\n\nThis is a powerful moment. Juan is framing this as a spiritual teaching moment for the entire court - showing that grace, honesty, and justice create transformation. He's connecting Don García's emotional vulnerability to the broader Christian themes of repentance and redemption.\n\nNow Juan is asking about heirs, which is practical and important - he needs to know the family situation before passing sentence. This shows wisdom: he's not just thinking about punishing or redeeming Don García himself, but about the broader implications for the family and estates.\n\nLet me think about Don García's likely family situation:\n- He's in his late 50s\n- He's a minor noble from Extremadura\n- His estates are described as \"modest\" \n- He fought at Antequera (1410), so he's been around a while\n\nMost nobles of this age and status would have:\n- A wife (probably)\n- Several children, likely some grown\n- Possibly grandchildren\n- An established succession plan\n\nI should have Don García respond to this question. Given his emotional state and Juan's grace, he'll answer honestly and directly. The answer will affect what Juan can do with the estates.\n\n\nDon García looks up, wiping roughly at his face with the back of his hand. The question seems to ground him slightly, pulling him from pure emotion back toward practical matters.\n\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty,\" he says, his voice still thick but steadier now. \"I have three sons and two daughters. My eldest, Rodrigo, is thirty-two. He manages the estates when I'm absent. A good man—steady, not given to his father's stubbornness.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, then continues with painful honesty: \"He begged me not to refuse the assessors, Your Majesty. When the officials first came, Rodrigo urged me to comply. Said the law was clear, that defiance would end badly. I... I didn't listen. Told him I knew better, that I'd dealt with royal demands before and knew how to handle them.\"\n\n\nHis voice drops. \"He was right. I was wrong. My stubbornness put his inheritance at risk, put his children—my grandchildren—at risk. Everything our house has built for two hundred years, nearly lost because an old man's pride was worth more to him than his family's future.\"\n\n\nAround the chamber, several nobles shift uncomfortably—recognizing themselves in the story, perhaps. How many of them have sons who urged compliance while fathers resisted?\n\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez speaks quietly: \"Your Majesty, the law is clear that estates are forfeit for defiance. However, the law also distinguishes between the guilty party and innocent heirs. The question becomes: does Don García's house survive his error, or does it fall with him?\"\n\n\nÁlvaro adds, his tone measured: \"If Your Majesty permits redemption through crusade service, the question of estates becomes more complex. A man redeemed through holy service might argue his heirs should not be punished for sins he himself has atoned for.\"\n\n\nDon García remains kneeling, but his eyes are fixed on you with desperate hope—not for himself, but clearly for his son, for his grandchildren, for the house he nearly destroyed.\n\n\nThe assembled nobles watch intently. This isn't just about one old man anymore—this is about precedent, about how royal justice works under the new system, about whether mercy and atonement can truly restore what defiance has forfeited.\n\n\nWhat is your judgment?"

Following the letter of the law (estates forfeit)\n2. Showing mercy to innocent heirs\n3. Not enriching the crown from rebellion\n4. Making clear the son must pay taxes\n5. Leaving spiritual redemption between Don García and God\n6. Creating powerful precedent about justice vs. vengeance\n\nThe archbishop's response needs to reflect the ecclesiastical perspective. The excommunication was for refusing the papal crusade tax. Don García has:\n- Submitted to royal judgment\n- Acknowledged his sin\n- His heir is paying the taxes\n\nFrom the Church's perspective, the material compliance (taxes paid) addresses the practical offense, but spiritual reconciliation requires genuine repentance - which Don García has clearly shown. The archbishop should be moved by this but also maintain proper ecclesiastical gravity.\n\nThis moment should be powerful - showing how royal mercy and ecclesiastical mercy can work together.\n\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez stands silent for a long moment, his eyes moving from you to Don García, then back. The chamber holds its breath.\n\n\nFinally, the Archbishop steps forward, his aged face grave but not without warmth.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty demonstrates wisdom beyond your years,\" he says, his voice carrying through the hall. \"You have satisfied the demands of law while honoring the principle of justice. The estates are forfeit as required, yet given to innocent heirs. The taxes will be paid. The defiance is punished without destroying a noble house that has served Castile for two centuries.\"\n\n\nHe turns to look at Don García, who remains kneeling, tears still wet on his weathered face.\n\n\n\"As for the matter of excommunication...\" The Archbishop's tone becomes more solemn. \"This is not a light thing. Cardinal Capranica pronounced sentence for defiance of holy tax approved by papal legate. The excommunication was justified—it stood between Don García and the sacraments, between his soul and God's grace.\"\n\n\nHe pauses, letting the weight settle.\n\n\n\"However.\" His voice softens slightly. \"The purpose of excommunication is not vengeance but correction. It is meant to bring the sinner to repentance, to recognition of error, to reconciliation with Holy Mother Church. I have witnessed Don García's confession here today. I have seen his tears of genuine remorse. I have heard him acknowledge not just legal wrongdoing but spiritual blindness—that he saw tax collection where he should have seen holy crusade, that he felt resentment where he should have felt duty.\"\n\n\nThe Archbishop looks back at you. \"Your Majesty leaves his redemption between Don García and God. This is proper—earthly kings judge earthly crimes. But the Church must judge spiritual reconciliation.\"\n\n\nHe turns fully to Don García now, his voice taking on formal ecclesiastical authority:\n\n\n\"Don García de Sotomayor. You have confessed your sin before God, before your king, and before this assembly. You have shown true contrition—not merely regret at consequences, but genuine sorrow for offense against God's crusade. The taxes you refused will be paid by your heir, satisfying material obligation. Your pride has been broken, your spirit humbled.\"\n\n\nThe Archbishop raises his hand in blessing. \"Therefore, I am satisfied that the conditions for lifting excommunication have been met. You may be reconciled to Holy Mother Church. But hear me clearly: this reconciliation requires penance. You will make full confession to a priest. You will receive absolution. And you will demonstrate your repentance through acts of charity and prayer.\"\n\n\nHis voice gentles further. \"Your king offers you the choice of joining his crusade. The Church echoes that offer—there is no greater penance, no surer path to redemption, than taking up arms in holy war. But whether you fight or pray, whether you serve in the field or from your estates, you will spend your remaining days proving your words today were true. Do you accept these terms?\"\n\n\nDon García's voice is barely a whisper: \"Yes, Your Excellency. With all my heart.\"\n\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez makes the sign of the cross over him. \"Then by the authority vested in me as Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain, I lift the sentence of excommunication. You are restored to the Church, Don García. May God grant you the grace to live worthily of this mercy.\"\n\n\nHe steps back, and Don García remains kneeling, head bowed, shoulders shaking with silent sobs—but these are tears of relief now, not shame.\n\n\nThe chamber remains silent for several heartbeats. Then Álvaro speaks, his voice crisp and efficient but not unkind:\n\n\n\"Don García, you may rise. Your son will be summoned to Toledo to receive the estates and sign the feudal contract. The taxes owed will be calculated and payment expected within thirty days. This concludes your trial.\"\n\n\nDon García rises slowly, unsteadily. He looks at you, seems about to speak, then simply bows deeply—the bow of a man who knows he's been given far more than he deserved.\n\n\nSeveral nobles in the gallery are visibly moved. Others look thoughtful, calculating what this precedent means. A few of the older lords are dabbing at their eyes—recognizing themselves in Don García's pride and stubbornness, perhaps grateful that mercy is possible.\n\n\nOne of the younger nobles near the front—you recognize him as Don Fernando de Valdés, whose father is among those still resisting tax assessment in the north—is staring at Don García with an expression of dawning realization, as if seeing his own father's possible future.\n\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea, the Crown Marshal who brought Don García in, steps forward and speaks clearly:\n\n\n\"Let the record show that on this day, the Crown Marshals' authority has been exercised with both justice and mercy. Defiance was punished. The law was satisfied. Yet an old man who surrendered peacefully and showed true remorse walks free, and his innocent heirs retain their inheritance. This is the standard to which all nobles are held.\"\n\n\nHe looks out at the assembled court. \"Pay your taxes. Submit to assessment. Honor the law. Do this, and you have nothing to fear. Defy it, and you risk everything—but even then, if you show the courage Don García showed today, justice will be tempered with mercy.\"\n\n\nThe message is clear: comply, or face consequences—but even rebels who repent can find grace.\n\n\nÁlvaro looks at you. \"Does Your Majesty have further business with Don García, or shall he be dismissed to make his confession and consider his path forward?\"\n\n\nWhat do you do?"

But first I need to wrap up the current scene with Don García - Juan hasn't dismissed him yet. Let me handle this smoothly.\n\nJuan is speaking to Álvaro in the throne room, presumably in front of everyone. This is actually a public instruction about how the new system will work. That's fine - it's showing how the new feudal contracts operate under the post-crusade system.\n\nThe 10% is higher than the 8% crusade tax, but this is the permanent peacetime rate for newly granted/re-granted estates. This makes sense as a baseline, and Juan notes he can reduce it later if needed.\n\nI should have Álvaro acknowledge this, perhaps with some brief comment about the system, then transition to dismissing Don García and moving to the next item on Juan's agenda - founding the Royal Military Academy.\n\n\nÁlvaro nods, already mentally organizing the details. \"Ten percent with decennial assessment reviews. Understood, Your Majesty. This will become the new standard for all estates being re-granted or newly granted going forward.\"\n\n\nHe glances at the assembled nobles—several are paying very close attention to this detail, understanding that precedent is being set.\n\n\n\"The contract will specify: ten percent of assessed revenues, paid quarterly. Assessment conducted by royal officials every ten years, with the lord entitled to dispute findings through formal appeal process. The lord retains all traditional feudal rights—jurisdiction over his lands, the loyalty of his vassals, military obligations as per custom. Only the tax structure is modernized.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro looks at Don García. \"Your son Rodrigo will receive these terms when he comes to Toledo. They are generous, Don García—far more generous than many lords currently enjoy. Your Majesty is establishing a clear, predictable system. No arbitrary demands, no sudden changes. Just fair taxation with regular review.\"\n\n\nDon García bows again, deeply. \"Your Majesty's mercy knows no bounds. My son will serve faithfully, I swear it.\"\n\n\nYou dismiss him with a gesture, and he backs away from the throne, still bowing. The guards escort him out—not roughly, but respectfully, as befits a man who has been judged and shown mercy.\n\n\nAs the doors close behind him, the murmur of conversation ripples through the assembled nobles. You hear fragments:\n\n\n\"...showed true remorse, you have to admit...\"\n\"...ten percent though, that's not nothing...\"\n\"...at least it's fixed, not arbitrary...\"\n\"...his son keeps everything, remarkable...\"\n\n\nÁlvaro turns back to you, his voice low enough that only you, the Archbishop, and the Crown Marshals can hear:\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, that was masterfully done. You satisfied the law, preserved a noble house, demonstrated mercy without weakness, and established clear precedent. Every noble in this room now understands: defy, and you risk everything. Submit and show remorse, and even rebellion can be forgiven. But the new system—the taxes, the assessments, the accountability—that's not negotiable.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"Baron de Medina and the Count of Niebla will hear about this within days. They now know what awaits them if they surrender: justice, yes, but justice tempered with mercy. It might encourage them to yield rather than fight.\"\n\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez adds quietly: \"Your Majesty showed the court how Christian kingship functions—justice without cruelty, law without vengeance, mercy without weakness. This is a lesson that will be remembered.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro glances at the assembled court. \"Do you wish to address the academy founding now, or dismiss the court first?

Alfonso V of Aragon is currently around 43 years old in 1432, childless, obsessed with Naples, married to Maria of Castile (Juan's cousin) but the marriage is cold and he's been in Italy for years. The Infantes have already been eliminated from succession, which means if Alfonso dies without heirs, the succession becomes very murky.\n\nLet me create a realistic d100 table about what could happen with Alfonso V in early 1432. I need to consider:\n\n1. He could just continue as normal (most likely)\n2. He could have health issues or die (historically he lived until 1458, so death would be alternate history but possible)\n3. He could take action regarding succession - either try to produce an heir, or formally designate someone\n4. He could get involved in Castilian politics\n5. Naples campaign developments\n\nLet me be realistic about medieval mortality, warfare, disease, and political dynamics.\n\n\nKing Alfonso V of Aragon - Early 1432 Status - d100 Table\n\n\nROLL 1-5: Sudden Death in Naples\nAlfonso V dies unexpectedly—either from illness (camp fever, dysentery common in Italian campaigns), assassination by rival Italian faction, or combat injury that turns fatal. He's 43, been campaigning hard in Italy for years, living in military camps. Medieval warfare and disease made sudden royal deaths common. Dies without legitimate heirs. Aragon faces immediate succession crisis. With Infantes eliminated, Juan's claim becomes viable immediately. News takes 3-4 weeks to reach Castile. Massive political upheaval. Juan must decide whether to pursue claim while still dealing with Granada and rebel nobles.\n\n\nROLL 6-12: Serious Illness/Injury\nAlfonso falls seriously ill or is wounded in Naples campaign. Not immediately fatal but severe enough that succession becomes urgent concern. He's bedridden for months, recovery uncertain. Aragonese Cortes begins discussing contingency plans. Some factions start looking toward Juan as potential heir if Alfonso dies. Others seek distant relatives. Political maneuvering intensifies. Juan hears rumors but situation remains unclear for weeks. Alfonso may recover or may not—creates extended uncertainty.\n\n\nROLL 13-20: Military Disaster in Italy\nAlfonso's Naples campaign suffers major defeat. Significant casualties, loss of territory, huge financial cost. Forces him to reconsider Italian ambitions. Still alive and healthy but reputation damaged. Some Aragonese nobles begin questioning his obsession with Italy while ignoring Iberian interests. Doesn't directly affect Juan yet, but weakens Alfonso's position and makes Aragonese nobility more open to alternative leadership eventually.\n\n\nROLL 21-35: Continues Naples Campaign (Status Quo)\nAlfonso remains completely focused on Italian ambitions. Naples campaign continues with mixed results—some gains, some setbacks, nothing decisive. He shows no interest in Iberia, no concern about succession, no response to Infantes' elimination. Married to Maria of Castile in name only—hasn't seen her in years, no prospect of heirs. Juan's potential succession claim remains theoretical and distant. Nothing changes in immediate term.\n\n\nROLL 36-50: Italian Success Deepens His Obsession\nAlfonso achieves significant victory in Naples campaign—takes key city, defeats rival, consolidates territory. This success makes him even more committed to Italy, even less interested in Iberian affairs. Talks of making Naples his primary kingdom, possibly moving capital there. Aragonese nobles divided—some proud of Italian empire, others worried about abandonment of Spanish interests. Still no heirs, still no succession planning. His detachment from Iberia actually helps Juan long-term by making Castilian succession more palatable to Aragonese when time comes.\n\n\nROLL 51-63: Passive Awareness, No Action\nAlfonso hears about Infantes' complete elimination from succession. Receives reports about Juan's successful crusade, growing power, reputation. Intellectually understands this creates succession question but takes no action. Too focused on Naples, too distant from Iberian politics, too confident he has time to deal with it later. Sends polite congratulatory letter about Granada victories but nothing substantive. Succession question remains unresolved. This is realistic—many medieval kings ignored succession until too late.\n\n\nROLL 64-75: Considers Legitimizing Bastards\nAlfonso has several illegitimate children from various liaisons in Italy. Begins seriously considering legitimizing one—probably Ferrante (his son by mistress Gueraldona Carlino). Consults with advisors about legal mechanisms. Aragonese Cortes would have to approve. Some nobles support this (preserves Aragonese independence), others oppose (bastard succession always controversial). Doesn't act immediately but starts process. This complicates Juan's potential claim—legitimate king's bastard vs. legitimate half-brother from different mother? Creates legal mess. Juan hears rumors within 2-3 months.\n\n\nROLL 76-82: Attempts Reconciliation with Wife\nAlfonso, recognizing succession problem, makes unusual move: invites Maria of Castile to Naples, attempts to reconcile marriage and produce heir. After years of neglect, this is awkward and possibly futile (she's in her 40s now), but he tries. Maria torn—he abandoned her for years, but producing heir serves her interests too. Outcome uncertain, depends on her willingness and biological possibility. If successful, undermines Juan's claim. If fails, reinforces that Alfonso's line ends with him. Juan learns of this within weeks—Maria is his cousin, and Toledo court hears everything.\n\n\nROLL 83-88: Sends Delegation to Investigate Juan\nAlfonso, hearing reports of Juan's success, sends trusted envoys to Castile ostensibly to congratulate on crusade victories but actually to assess Juan as potential heir. They observe court, military capability, political stability, Juan's character. Report back to Alfonso with recommendations. Alfonso doesn't commit to anything but clearly considering the question. Envoys arrive in Toledo in 4-6 weeks. This is opportunity for Juan to make good impression on Aragonese representatives.\n\n\nROLL 89-93: Proposes Formal Alliance/Mutual Defense\nAlfonso, pragmatic politician despite Italian obsession, recognizes that successful crusading king in Castile is valuable ally. Proposes formal treaty—mutual defense, coordinated crusading, perhaps joint operations against Muslims. Avoids succession question entirely but builds relationship. Frames it as cooperation between brother kingdoms (technically Juan is his half-brother). This strengthens Juan's position indirectly—if Aragonese nobles see Castile as ally rather than rival, eventual succession becomes easier. Letter arrives within 2 months.\n\n\nROLL 94-97: Designates Juan as Heir (Conditional)\nAlfonso, facing reality of childlessness and Infantes' elimination, makes extraordinary move: formally designates Juan as his heir conditional on Alfonso dying without legitimate sons. Requires approval from Aragonese Cortes (not guaranteed but Alfonso pushes hard). Reasoning: Juan is his half-brother, proven leader, successful crusader, better than distant cousins or succession war. Makes Juan heir presumptive while preserving possibility Alfonso might still produce legitimate heir. This is huge—transforms Juan's claim from theoretical to officially recognized. News reaches Juan within 6-8 weeks. Aragonese Cortes debates intensely.\n\n\nROLL 98-100: Catastrophic Political Situation Forces His Return\nMajor crisis erupts in Aragon itself—serious noble rebellion, Catalan uprising, or external threat that cannot be ignored. Alfonso forced to abandon Naples campaign and return to Barcelona to deal with emergency. This brings him back to Iberian politics for first time in years. Must actually govern Aragon, face succession questions, deal with restive nobles. Makes him more aware of Juan's rising power and creates possibility of direct interaction between the two half-brothers. Whether this helps or hinders Juan depends on how Alfonso reacts to seeing his younger half-brother's success. Arrives Barcelona within 2 months, news reaches Juan immediately.\n\n\n\nThis table reflects realistic medieval possibilities while creating interesting narrative branches. Roll when ready."

Let me look at what that means:\n\n\"Alfonso's Naples campaign suffers major defeat. Significant casualties, loss of territory, huge financial cost. Forces him to reconsider Italian ambitions. Still alive and healthy but reputation damaged. Some Aragonese nobles begin questioning his obsession with Italy while ignoring Iberian interests. Doesn't directly affect Juan yet, but weakens Alfonso's position and makes Aragonese nobility more open to alternative leadership eventually.\"\n\nSo Alfonso is still alive and healthy, but has suffered a military disaster in Naples. This would weaken his position and make Aragonese nobles question his leadership. News would travel slowly - probably taking 3-4 weeks from Naples to reach Castile through merchant networks and diplomatic channels.\n\nJuan is currently in Toledo, about to leave for Seville to deal with the rebel nobles. Isabel's mother Queen Leonor is arriving just after he leaves (rolled 31 - arrives 1-2 days after his departure). \n\nI should draft how this news reaches Juan - probably through multiple sources over time, starting with rumors from merchants, then more detailed reports from diplomatic sources. The news would likely come while he's preparing to leave for Seville, or possibly just before/after his departure.\n\nI should make this feel realistic - medieval news traveled through multiple channels, often contradictory at first, then becoming clearer as more sources confirmed details.\n\n\nNews from Naples\nLate February 1432, Two Days Before Departure for Seville\n\n\n\nYou're in your study reviewing the final preparations for the Seville campaign when Álvaro enters with an unusual expression—not quite concern, but heightened alertness.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, something you should know. Multiple reports coming in from the Mediterranean. About King Alfonso.\"\n\n\nHe sets several documents on your desk—letters bearing different seals, clearly from different sources arriving at different times over the past week.\n\n\n\"The first hint came ten days ago,\" Álvaro explains, unfolding a letter with a Genoese merchant seal. \"Genoese traders in Valencia heard from their Naples factors that Alfonso had suffered 'some reverse.' No details, just that his campaign had encountered difficulties. I didn't think much of it—campaigns have setbacks.\"\n\n\nHe picks up another letter, this one bearing an Aragonese noble's seal. \"Five days ago, this arrived from Don Pedro de Urrea—he's a minor Aragonese noble who maintains estates in Barcelona but has cousins in Alfonso's Italian forces. He writes that his cousin sent word of 'significant defeat' at the hands of René of Anjou's forces near Naples. Casualties described as 'heavy,' though no specific numbers.\"\n\n\nA third letter, from a Valencian bishop. \"Three days ago. The bishop has contacts in Rome, and Roman sources report that Alfonso's army was caught in a disadvantageous engagement—something about being lured into ambush, losing substantial artillery, several prominent knights killed or captured. Alfonso himself is unhurt, but his forces were mauled badly enough that he's had to withdraw from positions he'd held for months.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro spreads the letters out. \"And this morning, confirmation from our ambassador in Barcelona.\" He taps the most recent letter. \"Alfonso's military disaster is common knowledge in Aragon now. Estimates suggest he lost perhaps 2,000-3,000 men—killed, wounded, or captured. More critically, he lost significant territory he'd spent the last two years securing. The cost in gold for ransoming captured nobles and rebuilding his forces will be enormous.\"\n\n\nHe looks up at you. \"Alfonso is alive and uninjured. But his reputation has taken a serious blow. The Barcelona letter mentions that Aragonese nobles are openly questioning whether their king should be bankrupting Aragon for Italian adventures while ignoring affairs in Iberia.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro pauses, choosing his next words carefully. \"There's more. The ambassador reports that some Aragonese nobles—he doesn't name them, probably wise—are quietly discussing succession again. Alfonso is 43, childless, has shown no interest in producing heirs. The Infantes are eliminated. And now Alfonso's military reputation—the one thing that justified his Italian obsession—is damaged.\"\n\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"The ambassador writes: 'Some look toward Castile with new interest. The young king who finishes the Reconquista contrasts favorably with the aging king who loses battles in Italy for no clear purpose.'\"\n\n\nÁlvaro sets down the letters. \"Your Majesty, this doesn't change anything immediately. Alfonso isn't dead, isn't incapacitated. He'll likely rebuild and try again—he's stubborn about Naples. But it weakens his position significantly. And it makes some Aragonese nobles—probably not a majority, but some—more receptive to the idea that when Alfonso eventually dies, Castile might offer better leadership than whatever distant cousin they could find.\"\n\n\nHe leans against the desk. \"The timing is actually favorable for you. You're about to leave for Seville to crush rebellious nobles decisively. Then you'll finish Granada. Every success you achieve contrasts with Alfonso's Italian failures. The comparison benefits you.\"\n\n\n\"Should we respond in any way? Send congratulations on his survival? Offer condolences for his losses? Or simply... take note and continue with your own plans?\"\n\n\nWhat do you want to do?"

      "say": "Thought process: Contextualized medieval succession dispute over Naples inheritance.\n\nThe user is asking about King Alfonso V of Aragon's campaigns in Naples. This is historical - Alfonso V was indeed obsessed with claiming and controlling the Kingdom of Naples in the 1430s-1440s. Let me provide accurate historical context.\n\nAlfonso V of Aragon claimed the Kingdom of Naples through:\n1. An adoption by Queen Joanna II of Naples, who had no heirs and adopted Alfonso as her heir in 1420\n2. However, Joanna later revoked the adoption and instead designated René of Anjou (Louis III of Anjou's brother) as her heir\n3. This created a succession dispute when Joanna died in 1435\n\nBut wait - in this timeline it's early 1432, so Joanna II is still alive. The conflict would be between Alfonso trying to secure his claim and René of Anjou (and his supporters) who represented the rival Angevin claim.\n\nThe war is essentially about who will inherit Naples when Queen Joanna II dies. It's a typical medieval succession dispute with multiple claimants backed by different factions.\n\nI should explain this clearly to the player so they understand the context of Alfonso's Italian obsession.\n\n\nÁlvaro straightens, clearly ready to explain the complex Italian situation.\n\n\n\"Alfonso is fighting for the Kingdom of Naples—one of the wealthiest kingdoms in Italy. The war is about succession, as these things always are.\"\n\n\nHe gestures as if sketching a map. \"Queen Joanna II of Naples is old, childless, and has been playing different claimants against each other for years. In 1420, she adopted Alfonso as her heir—formally made him her successor. Alfonso took this very seriously, saw himself as the rightful future King of Naples, started calling himself 'Rex Utriusque Siciliae'—King of Both Sicilies.\"\n\n\n\"But Joanna is... fickle. Changeable. A few years later, she revoked Alfonso's adoption and instead designated René of Anjou—from the French House of Anjou—as her heir. The Angevins have their own long-standing claim to Naples through previous generations.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro shakes his head. \"So now you have two men claiming to be the rightful heir to Naples: Alfonso of Aragon and René of Anjou. Joanna is still alive, still playing them against each other, still changing her mind. But both claimants have built up military forces in Italy, carved out territories, and are essentially fighting a war to position themselves for when she finally dies.\"\n\n\n\"Alfonso has been pouring Aragonese treasure and blood into this for over a decade. He's obsessed with it—sees Naples as his destiny, his great achievement. The Aragonese nobles are increasingly frustrated because their gold is being spent on Italian campaigns while Aragon itself sees no benefit.\"\n\n\nHe picks up one of the letters again. \"The recent defeat was at the hands of René's forces. From what the reports suggest, Alfonso was outmaneuvered—possibly lured into unfavorable terrain, possibly caught by surprise. The details are unclear, but the result isn't: significant losses, lost territory, damaged reputation.\"\n\n\n\"René of Anjou is backed by France and by Italian factions that prefer Angevin rule. Alfonso is backed by... well, Aragon's treasury, mostly. Some Italian allies, but his support is primarily his own resources.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro looks at you directly. \"The war is essentially a stalemate that's been dragging on for years. Neither side has decisively won. Joanna keeps both claimants uncertain. And Alfonso keeps pouring resources into it because he's convinced that if he just pushes a bit harder, spends a bit more, fights one more campaign, Naples will be his.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"The irony is that even if Alfonso wins Naples, he'll have spent a generation's worth of Aragonese wealth to acquire an Italian kingdom that will cost more wealth to hold. Meanwhile, he ignores Iberia, produces no heirs, and watches as his half-brother in Castile accomplishes what centuries of Spanish kings could not—finishing the Reconquista.\"\n\n\n\"The Aragonese nobles understand this. Which is why some are starting to question whether Alfonso's Italian dreams serve Aragon's interests, or merely his own ambition.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro sets the letter down. \"As for what you should do about this news? Honestly, Your Majesty, probably nothing. Let Alfonso exhaust himself in Italy. Let his nobles grow more frustrated. Let the contrast between his failures and your successes speak for itself. When the time comes—if the time comes—for Aragon's succession question, you want the Aragonese Cortes thinking: 'Better a successful crusader-king who cares about Iberia than a distant cousin or a bastard heir.'\"\n\n\n\"Does that answer your question?\""

This is an important ceremonial and strategic moment. Let me set the scene.\n\nFrom the project knowledge, I know:\n- The academy is being established in Toledo\n- Foreign military experts have arrived: János Hunyadi (Hungarian, Ottoman combat experience), Captain Jean de Metz (French), Francesco Sforza and Italian condottieri, German knights, Burgundian artillery experts\n- Also present: Master of Calatrava, experienced Castilian commanders\n- First cohort of students: 10-20 young nobles selected by Álvaro\n- The strategic council focused on developing anti-Ottoman/anti-Muslim warfare doctrine happened before\n- The academy's mission: develop comprehensive doctrine, synthesize European military knowledge, train professional officers, create institutional memory\n\nJuan is about to formally establish the academy with a speech/address. This should be ceremonial but also substantive - setting the mission and vision.\n\nI should describe:\n1. The location (probably a suitable building in Toledo, maybe repurposed)\n2. Who is assembled\n3. The atmosphere\n4. Give Juan opportunity to address them and formally establish the academy\n\nLet me make this feel significant - this is institutional building that will last beyond Juan's reign.\n\n\nFounding the Royal Military Academy\nLate February 1432, Toledo - Former Monastery of San Clemente\n\n\n\nYou and Álvaro ride through Toledo's winding streets toward the eastern quarter. The building chosen for the academy rises ahead—the former Monastery of San Clemente, a substantial stone structure with a large courtyard, multiple halls, and dormitory space. The monks relocated to a newer foundation last year, leaving the building available for royal use.\n\n\nAs you approach, you see the transformation already underway. The courtyard has been cleared and leveled for training exercises. Workmen are installing weapon racks along one wall. In the cloister, tables have been set up with maps, documents, and military texts. The chapel remains intact—the academy will still have space for prayer and Mass.\n\n\nGuards snap to attention as you enter. Álvaro leads you through to the main hall—once the monastery's refectory, now converted into an assembly chamber.\n\n\nThe room is packed with perhaps eighty men, and the atmosphere crackles with energy and anticipation.\n\n\nThe Foreign Experts:\n\n\nJános Hunyadi stands near the front, the Hungarian commander immediately recognizable by his bearing and the distinctive Hungarian dress. His three staff officers cluster nearby, battle-hardened men who've fought Ottomans from the Danube to the Balkans.\n\n\nCaptain Jean de Metz represents the French contingent—graying beard, professional soldier's bearing, standing with two other French infantry specialists.\n\n\nFrancesco Sforza, the Italian condottiere, cuts an impressive figure in expensive but practical clothing. Two of his lieutenants flank him—men who've fought in Italy's endless wars between city-states.\n\n\nThe German knights form their own cluster—three men in their forties, representatives of the Holy Roman Empire's heavy cavalry tradition. Burgundian artillery experts stand nearby, including the master gunner who came with their bombards.\n\n\nThe Castilian Officers:\n\n\nDon Pedro González de Padilla, Master of Calatrava, stands prominently—your eastern army commander and a man whose experience spans decades of frontier warfare.\n\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán, Master of Santiago, is present in his advisory capacity—too old for field command but invaluable for knowledge and counsel.\n\n\nSeveral veteran Castilian commanders you recognize from the campaign—men who've proven themselves at Alcalá la Real, Málaga, Ronda.\n\n\nThe Students:\n\n\nMost striking are the young men assembled along the sides—the first cohort of academy students. You count perhaps fifteen, ranging from late teens to mid-twenties. Álvaro clearly chose carefully:\n\n\nSeveral younger sons of loyal noble houses: a Mendoza cousin, an Enríquez nephew, two sons from Andalusian families\n\nA handful of knights without substantial inheritances\n\nTwo or three who appear to be exceptional common-born soldiers—you recognize one as a veteran sergeant from the crusade who distinguished himself in battle\n\nMarco Tornesi, the young Italian engineer, stands among them with eager intensity\n\n\nAll wear newly commissioned academy tunics—simple but dignified, bearing a small crusader cross insignia.\n\n\nThe room falls silent as you enter. Every man turns, straightens. János Hunyadi places fist over heart in salute. The Castilian masters bow. The students look at you with expressions mixing awe, excitement, and determination.\n\n\nÁlvaro announces clearly: \"His Majesty King Juan II of Castile and León, Commander of the Granada Crusade.\"\n\n\nYou step forward to the raised platform at the front of the hall—originally where the abbot would have sat during monastic meals, now serving as the academy's dais.\n\n\nThe assembled officers, experts, and students wait for you to speak. This is the moment to formally establish the institution's purpose and mission.\n\n\nWhat do you say?"

      "say": "Thought process: Weighed institutional success factors and constructed probabilistic outcomes table.\n\nThis is a fascinating moment - Juan is establishing what could become one of the most important military institutions in Europe. The question is: how effective will this academy be? What will it actually produce?\n\nLet me think about what factors would influence the outcome:\n\n1. **Leadership and coordination** - Can such diverse military traditions actually work together? Hungarians vs French vs Germans vs Italians vs Spanish - very different military cultures\n2. **Student quality** - Are the first cadets capable of absorbing this knowledge?\n3. **Practical vs theoretical balance** - Will they create usable doctrine or just theoretical treatises?\n4. **Time and resources** - Juan is leaving immediately, so they'll work without royal oversight\n5. **Cultural barriers** - Language, pride, competing methodologies\n6. **Motivation** - Everyone understands the Ottoman threat is real\n\nThe outcomes could range from:\n- Complete failure: Factionalism, competing schools, nothing coherent produced\n- Disappointing: Some useful information but mostly theoretical, not practical\n- Moderate success: Good doctrine produced but implementation unclear\n- Strong success: Comprehensive, practical doctrine that actually improves Castilian military\n- Revolutionary: Genuine innovation that could change European warfare\n\nLet me create a d100 table that reflects realistic medieval possibilities:\n\n\nRoyal Military Academy Initial Results - d100 Table\n\n\nROLL 1-8: Catastrophic Factionalism\nThe gathering dissolves into competing schools and national pride conflicts within weeks. Hungarians insist their Ottoman experience makes them the only real experts. French infantry specialists clash with German heavy cavalry advocates over fundamental tactics. Italians condescend to \"backward\" Iberians. Sforza and de Metz nearly come to blows over siege doctrine. The students are confused by contradictory instruction. By the time Juan returns from Seville, the academy has produced nothing coherent—just rival factions writing competing treatises that contradict each other. The foreign experts request to leave, citing impossible working conditions. Complete failure requiring complete reorganization.\n\n\nROLL 9-18: Disappointing Fragmentation\nThe council fractures into separate working groups that barely communicate. Each national contingent produces its own doctrine based on their experience, but there's no synthesis or integration. Hungarians write about light cavalry and fighting Ottomans. Germans write about heavy cavalry charges. French focus on infantry pike formations. Italians on siege engineering. All valuable individually, but not a coherent Castilian military doctrine. Students receive scattered, contradictory education. Some useful knowledge generated but academy fails its primary mission of creating unified anti-Muslim warfare doctrine. Needs major reform.\n\n\nROLL 19-30: Theoretical But Impractical\nThe experts collaborate adequately and produce comprehensive written doctrine—detailed treatises on formations, tactics, Ottoman weaknesses, campaign planning. Intellectually impressive, beautifully written, extensively researched. Problem: completely impractical for actual Castilian military implementation. Written by professional soldiers and foreign mercenaries who don't understand Castilian feudal military realities, noble pride, or resource limitations. Students learn theory but can't apply it. When presented to Castilian commanders, the response is: \"This would work with a professional standing army. We have feudal levies led by nobles who won't follow complex drill.\" Useful library material, poor practical doctrine.\n\n\nROLL 31-45: Modest Useful Output\nThe academy produces mixed results. Some genuine insights, particularly from Hunyadi on Ottoman tactics and weaknesses. Basic training improvements for students—better horsemanship, weapon drill, understanding of combined arms. But the synthesis of European knowledge never quite happens. Cultural barriers and language difficulties limit integration. By campaign's end, the academy has: (1) trained 15 marginally better junior officers, (2) produced basic tactical manual on fighting Muslims, (3) identified some Ottoman vulnerabilities. Useful but not transformative. A foundation to build on, but Juan's ambitious vision not yet realized.\n\n\nROLL 46-60: Solid Professional Foundation\nThe academy achieves moderate success. After initial friction, the experts find working rhythm under Master of Calatrava's coordination. Hunyadi emerges as natural leader on anti-Ottoman doctrine. The synthesis isn't revolutionary, but it's genuinely useful: practical tactics combining Hungarian mobility, German shock power, Italian engineering, and Castilian frontier experience. Students receive rigorous education in combined arms warfare, logistics, and campaign planning. By Juan's return, academy has: (1) comprehensive anti-Muslim tactical manual, (2) 15 well-trained junior officers ready for command, (3) ongoing program established. Proves concept works. Needs refinement but fundamentally sound.\n\n\nROLL 61-73: Strong Successful Integration\nThe academy exceeds basic expectations. The foreign experts, united by genuine respect and shared commitment to fighting Islam, collaborate effectively. Hunyadi's Ottoman experience provides framework; others contribute specialized knowledge. Students benefit from diverse perspectives. Key innovation: adapting Ottoman organizational flexibility to European heavy arms advantage. Practical doctrine emerges for: raiding warfare, siege operations against Muslim fortifications, countering light cavalry, campaign logistics in hostile territory. Students graduate genuinely competent in combined arms command. Multiple working tactical manuals produced. When presented to Castilian commanders, doctrine is actually implementable. Foundation for permanent professional officer corps established. Juan's investment validated.\n\n\nROLL 74-83: Remarkably Effective Synthesis\nThe academy achieves impressive success beyond Juan's expectations. Hunyadi proves to be not just experienced fighter but genuine military theorist. With Master of Calatrava's support, he coordinates experts into producing something remarkable: comprehensive doctrine synthesizing centuries of European anti-Muslim warfare with cutting-edge understanding of Ottoman methods. Key insights: Ottoman administrative-military system's strengths/weaknesses, importance of logistics and intelligence, combined arms integration, psychological warfare. Students receive world-class education. Three particularly talented cadets emerge as potential future commanders. Academy produces: detailed tactical doctrine, training standards, campaign planning frameworks, intelligence gathering methods. When tested, doctrine proves practical and effective. Other kingdoms begin hearing about Castile's military academy with interest.\n\n\nROLL 84-91: Revolutionary Collaboration\nSomething extraordinary happens: genuine intellectual partnership across cultures united by crusading purpose. Hunyadi, Sforza, de Metz, and Castilian masters forge unexpected friendship based on shared experience and complementary expertise. They don't just catalog tactics—they genuinely innovate. Key breakthroughs: understanding Ottoman sipahi system suggests Castilian military reform possibilities; Hungarian emphasis on intelligence and scouting transforms campaign planning; Italian engineering innovations applied to frontier warfare; combining heavy European cavalry with light raiding tactics creates hybrid warfare doctrine. Students receive transformative education—two or three show genuine strategic brilliance. Academy produces doctrine that could revolutionize Castilian military capability. Foreign experts request to stay permanently. Other Christian kingdoms begin sending observers. This becomes institution of genuine European importance.\n\n\nROLL 92-96: Unprecedented Innovation\nThe academy becomes a crucible of military innovation that will be studied for generations. The combination of desperate need (Ottoman threat), diverse expertise, talented students, and royal backing creates unique environment. Major innovations emerge: systematic officer training replacing noble birth-right command; combined arms doctrine integrating all weapon types; campaign logistics as science rather than improvisation; intelligence networks and reconnaissance as formal military discipline; anti-Ottoman tactical frameworks based on understanding their strengths rather than dismissing them. Hunyadi and the masters create something approaching modern staff college. The 15 students graduate as best-trained junior officers in Christendom. Academy establishes permanent curriculum, admission standards, promotion-by-merit principles. When Juan returns, he finds institution that could transform not just Castilian but European military capability. Within years, every Christian kingdom will try to copy this model.\n\n\nROLL 97-100: Historic Transformation\nThe academy achieves something that will echo through centuries: true synthesis of Christian military knowledge focused on existential Islamic threat. Hunyadi emerges as military genius, but supported by equally brilliant collaborators. They don't just study Ottoman warfare—they develop comprehensive counter-doctrine that addresses strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Revolutionary insights: (1) Ottoman success stems from administrative-military integration, not just tactics; (2) Christian military must professionalize to compete; (3) intelligence, logistics, and coordination matter more than individual valor; (4) combined arms synergy is future of warfare. The students absorb doctrine that's decades ahead of contemporary European thought. Academy produces: multi-volume comprehensive military doctrine, permanent institutional structure, trained officer corps, intelligence service framework, and reformation blueprint for Castilian military. Two or three students show potential to become great commanders. Other kingdoms desperately seek to recruit academy graduates. Pope hears about academy's success and considers establishing similar institution for crusading armies. This becomes Juan's most enduring legacy—not just conquering Granada, but creating institution that defends Christendom for generations.\n\n\n\nThis table balances realistic medieval constraints (language barriers, cultural pride, practical limitations) with the genuine possibility that bringing together this much talent could produce something extraordinary. Roll when ready."

The academy getting started on its work\n5. Juan preparing to leave for Seville\n\nThe result indicates: moderate success, after initial friction they find working rhythm, Hunyadi emerges as natural leader, synthesis isn't revolutionary but genuinely useful, practical tactics combining various traditions, students receive rigorous education, produces comprehensive anti-Muslim tactical manual and 15 well-trained officers, proves concept works, needs refinement but fundamentally sound.\n\nI should show the initial enthusiasm and setup, knowing that over the coming months while Juan is away, they'll achieve this moderate but solid result. I shouldn't narrate the final results yet since Juan is about to leave - those will emerge when he returns.

For a moment, silence—then János Hunyadi steps forward, places his fist over his heart again.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks truth that cuts to bone,\" he says, his accent thick but his voice carrying conviction. \"Ottoman armies are better organized. Better disciplined. They understand logistics, they understand coordination, they understand that war is not just about brave men but about systems.\"\n\n\nHe looks around at the assembled experts. \"In Hungary, we have bled for decades learning these lessons. We have watched Ottomans destroy Christian armies that should have won. Why? Because our nobles charge bravely while Turks maneuver intelligently. Because we rely on feudal levies while they maintain professional corps. Because we think individual valor wins wars, while they understand that organization wins wars.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to you. \"Your Majesty gives us sacred task: forge sword of Christendom. We accept. Not with pride of nation—Hungarian or French or German or Castilian—but with humility of soldiers who have seen what works and what fails.\"\n\n\nFrancesco Sforza steps forward next, his Italian sophistication evident even in this military setting. \"Your Majesty, in Italy we have studied Roman military texts, Greek stratagems, every innovation of warfare. But the condottieri fight for gold, not faith. Here, you offer something different: purpose beyond contract. Knowledge in service of crusade.\" He bows. \"The Italian tradition of military engineering and siege craft is yours.\"\n\n\nCaptain Jean de Metz speaks next, his grizzled face serious. \"French infantry has held field against English longbows and Burgundian cavalry. We know pike formations, we know discipline, we know how common soldiers properly trained can break noble cavalry.\" He glances at the students. \"These young men will learn that warfare is craft, not just birthright. This is good.\"\n\n\nThe German knight-commander—you recognize him as Heinrich von Plauen—bows stiffly. \"The traditions of Imperial heavy cavalry are at Your Majesty's disposal. We have fought from Baltic to Mediterranean. If Christendom is to face Ottoman threat united, then knowledge must be shared.\"\n\n\nDon Pedro González de Padilla, Master of Calatrava, steps forward. As the senior Castilian military figure present, his endorsement matters enormously.\n\n\n\"Your Majesty, I have fought Moors for thirty years on this frontier. I thought I knew everything about fighting Islam.\" He gestures to Hunyadi. \"In three conversations with this Hungarian, I learned that I knew how to fight Granada. Not how to fight the true power of Islam—the Ottomans who are ten times stronger, ten times better organized.\"\n\n\nHe looks at the students. \"These young men—some noble-born, some not—will learn what we should have been teaching for generations. Not just how to charge bravely, but how to win. How to coordinate cavalry and infantry. How to supply an army in hostile territory. How to gather intelligence and use it. How to plan campaigns that don't rely on God's miracles but on sound logistics and tactics.\"\n\n\nHe turns back to you. \"Your Majesty, this academy will forge officers Castile has never had. It will take time. It will be difficult. These men\"—he gestures to the foreign experts—\"come from different traditions, different languages, different ways of war. But if we can synthesize their knowledge with our frontier experience, we will create something valuable.\"\n\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán adds quietly, \"And when Your Majesty rides against Granada and beyond, you will have commanders who understand not just courage, but competence. Not just honor, but effectiveness. This is how Christendom survives the centuries ahead.\"\n\n\n\nÁlvaro steps forward with practical matters. \"The academy's immediate task while His Majesty campaigns: develop comprehensive tactical doctrine for fighting Muslim armies. Specifically:\"\n\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\n\"First: Document Ottoman military organization and tactics as Hunyadi knows them. Everything—from how they recruit and train, to how they supply armies, to how they coordinate cavalry and infantry, to how they use intelligence and reconnaissance.\"\n\n\n\"Second: Synthesize European military knowledge—Hungarian mobility and light cavalry tactics, German heavy cavalry shock power, French infantry formations, Italian siege engineering, Castilian frontier raiding experience. Find what works together.\"\n\n\n\"Third: Train these fifteen students rigorously. Horsemanship, weapon drill, map reading, logistics calculations, campaign planning, command decision-making. Make them into officers who can lead combined arms forces effectively.\"\n\n\n\"Fourth: Produce written doctrine—practical manuals that Castilian commanders can actually use. Not theoretical treatises, but operational guides. How to organize a raid. How to coordinate siege operations. How to counter Muslim light cavalry. How to maintain supply lines in enemy territory.\"\n\n\nÁlvaro looks at the assembled experts. \"Master of Calatrava will coordinate overall. János Hunyadi will lead the anti-Ottoman doctrine development. Each expert will contribute specialized knowledge. The students will learn from all of you and will test doctrine through exercises and war games.\"\n\n\nHe pauses. \"His Majesty returns from the rebel campaign in approximately two months, then begins final Granada offensive in late spring. By then, this academy should have: trained officer candidates ready for junior command positions, and comprehensive tactical doctrine ready for implementation.\"\n\n\n\"This is ambitious but achievable. You have royal backing, adequate funding, excellent facilities, and most importantly—you have purpose. Not just winning battles, but defending Christendom.\"\n\n\n\nJános Hunyadi speaks again, addressing the students directly now. \"Young men. You are privileged and burdened. Privileged to receive education that kings would envy. Burdened with knowledge that makes you responsible for others' lives.\"\n\n\nHis voice hardens with experience. \"I have seen brave men die because their commanders were fools. I have seen battles lost because nobles valued pride over wisdom. I have seen Christian armies destroyed because no one understood logistics, intelligence, coordination.\"\n\n\nHe points at them one by one. \"You will not be those commanders. You will learn how war actually works. Not romances and songs—reality. Mud and blood and supply wagons. Reconnaissance and maneuver. Mathematics of logistics and coordination of combined arms. You will learn why Ottomans win, and how Christians can win.\"\n\n\n\"Some of you are noble-born. Some are not. Here, that matters nothing. Only competence matters. Only results matter. The soldier who follows you into battle does not care about your lineage—he cares whether you will get him killed through stupidity.\"\n\n\nHe softens slightly. \"But if you learn what we teach, if you absorb this knowledge, if you become the officers Castile needs... you will serve God and kingdom more truly than any man who merely charges bravely and dies gloriously. There is no glory in defeat. There is only the grief of widows and the ashes of burning cities.\"\n\n\nThe students stare at him with expressions of awe and determination. This is not the warfare of romances—this is something harder, more demanding, more real.\n\n\n\nOne of the younger students—the Mendoza cousin, perhaps seventeen—raises his hand hesitantly. Master of Calatrava nods permission.\n\n\n\"Señor Hunyadi... Your Majesty...\" The boy's voice shakes slightly. \"We have heard stories of Ottoman armies. That they are... that they cannot be defeated. That they are too strong, too numerous, too well-organized. Is it... is it truly possible to beat them?\"\n\n\nSilence falls. Every eye turns to János Hunyadi.\n\n\nThe Hungarian looks at the boy for a long moment. Then his weathered face breaks into a grim smile.\n\n\n\"Yes. They can be beaten. I have beaten them. Not always. Not easily. But it is possible.\"\n\n\nHe steps closer to the students. \"Ottomans are not invincible. They are good. Very good. Better organized than most Christian armies, better disciplined, better supplied. But they are men. They bleed. They make mistakes. They have weaknesses.\"\n\n\n\"The question is not whether they can be beaten. The question is whether you have the knowledge, the discipline, and the wisdom to beat them. That is why you are here. That is what we will teach you.\"\n\n\nHe looks back at you. \"Your Majesty, give us two months. We will give you the beginning of something valuable.\"\n\n\n\nThe hall erupts in a low murmur of conversation—experts already beginning to discuss, students whispering excitedly among themselves, the energy palpable.\n\n\nÁlvaro leans close to you and murmurs, \"That went as well as we could hope, Your Majesty. They're unified in purpose, they respect each other's expertise, and Hunyadi is already emerging as the natural leader for the anti-Ottoman work. This will be solid. Maybe not revolutionary, but solid—which is honestly what we need. A foundation we can build on.\"\n\n\nDon Pedro approaches, bows. \"Your Majesty, with your permission, I'll convene the first working session this afternoon. Get the experts talking specifics, establish working groups, set the students to initial assessments and reading. By the time you return from Seville, we'll have results to show you.\"\n\n\nThe academy is established. The work begins.\n\n\nWhat do you do now? You leave for Seville tomorrow."

You depart tomorrow morning—February 28th.\" He pauses, calculating. \"The journey to Seville will take approximately eight to nine days at reasonable pace with your escort. That puts you arriving around March 7th or 8th.\"\n\n\nHe consults notes he's been keeping. \"The troops are assembling outside Seville now. The five bombards left Jaén three weeks ago—they should arrive at Seville within the next few days, certainly before you arrive. Don Rodrigo Manrique has command of the gathering forces. Last report put numbers at roughly 5,000 present, with more arriving daily. By the time you reach Seville, you should have 6,500 to 7,000 troops assembled and ready.\"\n\n\n\"The foreign professional soldiers—the 550 to 600 mercenaries—are already there or en route. They'll form a valuable core of experienced troops for the sieges.\"\n\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"Which means you have tonight and tomorrow morning with Isabel before departure. Queen Leonor...\" He hesitates. \"Based on when she departed and the roads in February, she's likely still four or five days away. She'll arrive just after you've left, or possibly the very day you depart if her party makes exceptional time.\"\n\n\nHis expression shows sympathy. \"Isabel will have her mother's support soon after you leave. That's something, at least.\"\n\n\n\"Is there anything else you need to arrange before departure, Your Majesty? The academy is established, Don García's trial is complete, the contracts are being drafted. Tomorrow you ride for war.\"\n\n\nWhat do you do with your last evening in Toledo?"
