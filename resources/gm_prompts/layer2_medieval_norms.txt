MEDIEVAL SOCIAL NORMS — 15th Century Castile
Context for authentic NPC behavior and world portrayal.
═══════════════════════════════════════════

POLITICAL STRUCTURE:
The Crown of Castile is not an absolute monarchy. Power is shared and contested
among the King, the high nobility (Grandes), the Church, and the Cortes
(representative assembly of towns). The King's authority depends on maintaining
a coalition of support among these groups.

The Grandes hold vast territorial domains with their own courts, militias, and
tax collection. They owe fealty to the Crown but exercise near-sovereign power
in their lands. They view themselves as peers of the King in dignity, merely
subject to him in law.

The Cortes controls the granting of extraordinary taxes (servicios). The King
cannot levy new taxes without Cortes approval. Towns jealously guard their
charters (fueros) and privileges.

SOCIAL HIERARCHY:
1. The King and Royal Family
2. High Clergy (Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots of major orders)
3. Grandes (Dukes, Marquises, Counts)
4. Ricos hombres (wealthy nobles without grandee title)
5. Caballeros and Hidalgos (lesser nobility, knights)
6. Letrados (university-educated administrators, lawyers)
7. Merchants and wealthy townsmen
8. Artisans and urban commoners
9. Peasants (free and serf)
10. Religious minorities (Jews, Mudéjars)

FORMS OF ADDRESS:
- King: "Vuestra Majestad" (Your Majesty), "Señor" (Sire)
- Grandes: "Vuestra Señoría" or by title ("mi señor Conde")
- Clergy: "Su Eminencia" (cardinal), "Su Ilustrísima" (bishop), "Padre" (priest)
- Knights: "Don [name]", "Señor [name]"

HONOR CULTURE:
Honor is not an abstract concept — it is social currency. A man's honor
determines his marriage prospects, political alliances, creditworthiness,
and legal standing. Insults to honor demand response. Public humiliation
is worse than private injury. A nobleman would rather fight than be seen
to accept dishonor.

RELIGION:
Christianity pervades all aspects of life. Oaths are sworn before God.
Treaties invoke divine witness. The Church calendar structures daily and
yearly rhythms. Heresy is not just religious error — it is political
treason against the social order. The Church courts have jurisdiction
over clergy, marriage, inheritance, and moral offenses.

WARFARE:
War is the province of the nobility. Military service is tied to land
tenure. The Grandes maintain private armies (mesnadas). The Crown's
standing forces are limited. Sieges are more common than pitched battles.
Mercenaries (including foreign companies) are frequently employed.
Chivalric ideals exist alongside brutal pragmatism.

ECONOMY:
The Castilian economy is based on wool production and export, grain
agriculture, and Mediterranean trade. The Mesta (sheep-owners' guild)
is politically powerful. Currency is the maravedí. International trade
flows through Seville, Burgos, and the northern ports. Italian bankers
(Genoese especially) provide credit and manage royal finances.
