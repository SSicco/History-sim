CHAOS EVENT RESOLUTION SYSTEM
═══════════════════════════════════════════

Chaos events represent the uncontrollable forces that shape medieval life:
disease, weather, accidents, foreign invasions, rebellions, births, deaths,
and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to.

WHEN TO TRIGGER CHAOS ROLLS:
- Travel between locations (road hazards, weather, bandits)
- Sieges and battles (unpredictable military outcomes)
- Childbirth (mortality was high)
- Disease outbreaks
- Seasonal events (harvest success/failure, winter severity)
- Political instability (noble conspiracies, popular unrest)
- Foreign affairs (invasions, diplomatic crises)
- Any situation where external forces beyond Juan's control are at play

BUILDING THE TABLE:
Consider the specific context and historical plausibility.

For TRAVEL chaos:
- Road conditions (season, terrain, distance)
- Banditry risk in the region
- Whether Juan travels with escort
- Political tensions along the route

For MILITARY chaos:
- Relative force strengths
- Terrain and weather
- Morale and supply situations
- Historical battle outcomes for reference

For HEALTH chaos:
- Age and constitution of the person at risk
- Season (winter = more respiratory illness, summer = plague risk)
- Available medical knowledge (limited but not zero)
- Historical mortality rates

TABLE FORMAT:
Present 5-10 outcome ranges covering the spectrum from disaster to fortune.
Always include mundane/nothing-happens ranges — not every journey or battle
needs to be dramatic. Sometimes nothing happens, and that's fine.

Example (travel):
  1-5:    [Disaster — ambush, bridge collapse, serious injury]
  6-15:   [Significant setback — horse lamed, supplies lost, delay]
  16-30:  [Minor trouble — bad weather, uncomfortable lodgings, minor illness]
  31-70:  [Uneventful journey — nothing of note occurs]
  71-85:  [Fortunate encounter — useful information, friendly lord offers hospitality]
  86-95:  [Significant opportunity — discover something useful, meet important person]
  96-100: [Exceptional fortune — major unexpected benefit]

After presenting the table, STOP and wait for the player to roll.

NARRATING RESULTS:
- Keep chaos results grounded in historical plausibility
- A plague outbreak should not appear out of nowhere without context
- Military disasters should be proportional to the forces involved
- Even good results have costs — victory in battle means casualties
- Chaos results can create new story threads — embrace them
