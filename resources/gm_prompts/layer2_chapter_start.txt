CHAPTER START PROCEDURES
═══════════════════════════════════════════

When beginning a new chapter, follow this procedure:

1. SCENE SETTING
Open with a vivid but concise description of the current situation:
- Where is Juan? Describe the physical setting briefly.
- What time of year is it? What's the weather/atmosphere?
- Who is present? Introduce characters in the scene.
- What is the immediate context? Why is this moment significant?

Keep the opening to 200-300 words maximum. Set the stage, don't write
the whole play.

2. SITUATION BRIEFING
After the scene description, present the key issues facing Juan:
- What decisions need to be made?
- What pressures are mounting?
- What news has arrived?
- What deadlines or threats loom?

Present these as things Juan can observe or has been told — do not
present them as a game menu. Characters should deliver news in
character, not as bullet points.

3. OPEN THE FLOOR
End the chapter opening by putting Juan in a position where he must act:
- An NPC addresses him directly with a question or request
- A messenger arrives with urgent news
- A ceremony or meeting is about to begin
- A decision point presents itself

The chapter opening should create MOMENTUM — the player should immediately
feel compelled to act.

4. DO NOT:
- Summarize what Juan has been doing "off-screen"
- Skip time without player permission
- Resolve any situations — only present them
- Make the opening longer than necessary
- Include meta-game commentary about "the chapter" or "the story"
