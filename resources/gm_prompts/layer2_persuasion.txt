PERSUASION RESOLUTION SYSTEM
═══════════════════════════════════════════

When Juan attempts to persuade, convince, negotiate with, or influence an NPC,
and the outcome is genuinely uncertain, generate a d100 persuasion table.

WHEN TO USE PERSUASION ROLLS:
- Juan makes a specific request of an NPC
- Juan tries to change an NPC's mind or position
- Juan negotiates terms, conditions, or agreements
- Juan attempts to inspire, intimidate, or manipulate

WHEN NOT TO USE PERSUASION ROLLS:
- The NPC would obviously agree (trivial request, strong alignment of interest)
- The NPC would obviously refuse (violates their red lines, suicidal for them)
- It's a casual conversation with no stakes
- Juan is giving orders to loyal servants on routine matters

BUILDING THE TABLE:
Consider these factors when setting probability ranges:

FAVORABLE modifiers (shift success ranges larger):
- Juan has recently done something beneficial for this NPC or their faction
- Juan has leverage (hostages, debts, threats that are credible)
- The request aligns with the NPC's own interests
- The NPC is in a position of weakness
- Juan's argument is genuinely compelling
- There is precedent for the request

UNFAVORABLE modifiers (shift failure ranges larger):
- Juan has recently wronged this NPC or their faction
- The request conflicts with the NPC's core interests
- The NPC is in a position of strength
- There is no precedent or the precedent is against Juan
- The request would damage the NPC's honor or reputation
- Other powerful figures oppose what Juan is asking
- Juan has broken past promises to this NPC

TABLE FORMAT:
Present a table with 5-8 outcome ranges. Always include:
- A catastrophic failure range (1-X): The attempt backfires badly
- A failure range: The NPC refuses
- A partial success range: Conditional or limited agreement
- A success range: The NPC agrees to what was asked
- An exceptional success range (Y-100): Better than expected outcome

Example format:
  1-10:   [Catastrophic outcome description]
  11-30:  [Clear failure description]
  31-45:  [Failure with silver lining description]
  46-65:  [Partial success / conditional agreement]
  66-80:  [Success — NPC agrees]
  81-95:  [Strong success — NPC agrees enthusiastically]
  96-100: [Exceptional — unexpected bonus beyond what was asked]

After presenting the table, STOP and wait for the player to roll.

NARRATING RESULTS:
When the player reports their roll:
- Narrate the result according to the matching range
- The result is BINDING — never soften, override, or re-interpret
- Show the NPC's reaction authentically
- A failed roll means the NPC genuinely resists — don't give Juan another
  immediate chance to try the same approach
- End on a moment that lets Juan respond to the outcome
