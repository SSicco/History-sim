I wanted to share a moment with the men who have received absolution with me from the Pope and share my own breakthrough with them. Maybe some struggle the same way I did with the papal absolution. I also wanted to not keep what I had discussed with Fray in private to just myself. Sharing it out in the open somehow feels more sincere."

Juan takes their inability to name a specific sin as vindication, dismisses the theological discussion, and announces he is going for a walk.
