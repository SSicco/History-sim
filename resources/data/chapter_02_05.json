The Castilian delegation's meeting has concluded—your men now understand both your commitments to the Byzantines and the constraints under which you operate. Their expressions revealed a mixture of pride in your bold vision and quiet concern about its scope. The ninth hour meeting with Cardinal Cesarini tomorrow looms large in your thoughts. The President of the Council himself, the man who walks the razor's edge between Pope and Council, has agreed to receive you privately. What you say there could shape how Castile is perceived at Basel for years to come."

Now there are two ways you might respond: First way—explaining: 'I can see why it sounds that way. In my excitement, I put myself at the center of the language. What actually happened was Cardinal Cesarini and I discussed an approach together, and I am one part of it. But yes, the way I spoke just now—\"I have made a plan\"—that does reveal pride. Help me understand why I defaulted to that language.' Second way—defending: 'I know it sounds presumptuous, but actually I am in a unique position with papal decree and crusader authority, and convincing the Pope is logical given my circumstances, and most clergy don't practice confession as much as I do, and I am ready to stand before God's judgment, so really my presumption is justified by my special situation.' Do you see? The first opens to examination. The second closes it. The first invites me to help you see more clearly. The second explains why my correction doesn't apply."

You noticed your own language drifting toward placing yourself at the center, and you brought it to me for examination. This is spiritual maturity. So let us examine it together. You say you are happy and relieved that 'we can save the Church.' Already better language than 'I will reform the Church.' But then you say 'Cesarini has put me at the fulcrum.' What does that reveal? I think it reveals something true and something dangerous living together. The true part: You do have a significant role to play. Papal decree, moral authority from Granada, fresh perspective, willingness to bridge factions—these are real. Cesarini clearly sees value in your involvement. That is not pride, that is reality. The dangerous part: Your natural drift is toward seeing yourself as the key piece. The fulcrum—the point on which everything else turns. Not 'one person among many working together,' but 'the person around whom the solution revolves.' You caught yourself before saying it fully, which is good. But the fact that you drifted there... Your Majesty, I think you carry a burden many men in power carry: the belief that if you are not central, nothing will get done. That if you do not make things happen, they will not happen. This comes from real experience—you have made things happen. Granada fell because you led. But this truth can become spiritual poison when it makes you believe you must always be the one making things happen. So here is my question, and I ask it not to condemn but to help you see: When you imagine this reform effort succeeding, what do you see? Do you see many people working together with you as one among them? Or do you see yourself as the central figure with others supporting your efforts? Be honest. What do you actually see when you imagine success?"

But here is what I must still ask, because I love your soul too much not to: When you think about conveying this reality to Pope Eugenius, what do you hope for? Not what you expect—what do you hope for in your heart of hearts? And be honest—do you hope he will see wisdom and act accordingly? Or do you hope he will see your wisdom and recognize you as the man who showed him the way? The difference is subtle, Your Majesty. But it matters. One is serving the Church.

I have spent these days doing nothing but to speak with others about theology, faith, wisdom... im just tired of it. The church is so broken that it has also lost much of it's luster.
