He meets with his delegation — Abbott Rodrigo Gonzalez, Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena, and Fray Hernando — giving instructions to continue pushing the crusade decree and meaningful reforms at the Council. Juan asks Fray Hernando to accompany him home and onward to Constantinople rather than remain at Basel. Fray Hernando agrees, recognizing that his primary duty as confessor is to Juan's soul, especially given the spiritual temptations ahead. Abbott Rodrigo and Bishop Alfonso accept leadership of the remaining delegation. Captain Robles informs Juan that the Byzantine delegation and seventeen crusaders departed the previous evening, carrying messages of dedication. Juan's party of thirty-three crusaders departs Basel.",

          "text": "Thought process\n\nThe user is starting Chapter 2.8 of their historical simulation. They want me to read the project files to understand the current state of the game and then describe what King Juan II sees.\n\nLet me start by searching the project knowledge and reading the relevant files to understand the current situation.\n\nGiven the summary says \"Early June 1433\" for Juan's departure, and the last dated event was June 1 afternoon, it seems like we should be on June 2nd or thereabouts, perhaps just before or during Juan's departure from Basel.\n\nLet me present the scene - Juan is likely preparing to depart Basel to intercept Emperor Sigismund on the road north from Rome. I should describe what he sees as the chapter opens.\n\nThe morning light of June 2nd, 1433 filters through the leaded windows of your chamber in the merchant's house. You have risen early—the instinct of a campaigner who spent eighteen months in the field does not fade easily.\n\nYour traveling clothes are laid out by a servant: the practical garments of a man who intends to ride hard, not the silks of diplomatic audience. Your small traveling party waits below—thirty-three crusaders remaining after seventeen departed with the Byzantine delegation yesterday evening, their white tabards bright against the gray of Basel's streets as they headed east toward Constantinople with Metropolitans Bessarion and Isidore.\n\nThrough the window, you can see the cathedral spire rising above the rooftops. Somewhere in that vast building, the Council continues its deliberations—the four deputations grinding through procedural votes, the French and Germans circling each other like wary dogs, Cardinal Cesarini struggling to hold the whole enterprise together. Your Castilian delegation remains: Abbott Rodrigo, Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena, Fray Hernando. They will continue the work here.\n\nThe roads south are open. Emperor Sigismund was crowned in Rome on May 31st—two days ago—and will now be making his way north. If you ride hard, you can intercept him somewhere in the Italian Alps or the Swiss cantons. The Emperor who signed himself \"perhaps in purpose\" awaits meeting the king who actually completed a crusade.\n\nCaptain Robles appears at your door, armor gleaming in the morning light. \"Your Majesty. The horses are ready. Abbott Rodrigo and Fray Hernando are waiting below—they wish to bid you farewell.\"\n\nThe chamber is quiet. Your letters to Álvaro de Luna and Emperor John VIII are already on their way to Castile and Constantinople. What remains is the road, the meeting with Sigismund, and then—God willing—home to Toledo before Isabel's time comes.\n\nWhat do you do?"

          "text": "Juan is going to speak with his delegation before departing Basel. He's asking Abbott Rodrigo specifically about continuing the work at the Council while Juan travels to Toledo.\n\nLet me think about this scene. The key characters present would be:\n- Abbott Rodrigo González (age 73, chief of Castilian delegation, eight months at Basel)\n- Fray Hernando de Talavera (Juan's confessor, leading delegation spiritually)\n- Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena (skilled orator, theological presenter)\n- Captain Robles (military commander)\n\nAbbott Rodrigo is weary after eight months but still sharp. He's been managing the delegation and knows the Council dynamics intimately. He should respond realistically - he can continue the work, but he should be honest about what's possible given the Council's paralysis.\n\nI need to write the scene, have Abbott Rodrigo respond, and then STOP for Juan's next input. Short response since this is dialogue.\n\nThe main hall of the merchant's house is modest but well-appointed—dark wood panels, a fire crackling against the morning chill that lingers even in June this far north. Your delegation has gathered near the hearth.\n\nAbbott Rodrigo González stands with the aid of a walking stick, his seventy-three years showing more heavily than when you first met him in Rome three years ago. Eight months in Basel have worn him thin. Beside him, Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena waits with his customary composed expression. Fray Hernando stands slightly apart, his Franciscan robes plain against the merchant's finery—your confessor's eyes watchful, as always.\n\nAt your question, Abbott Rodrigo inclines his head. The firelight catches the deep lines around his eyes.\n\n\"Continue, Your Majesty? Yes. We will continue.\" He pauses, choosing his words with the care of a man who has spent decades in church politics. \"But I would have you understand what 'continue' means in this place.\"\n\nHe gestures vaguely toward the cathedral.\n\n\"The German cardinals are sincere—they will push for the crusade decree. Bishop Alfonso's addresses still command respect. Fray Hernando's counsel is sought by Cardinal Cesarini himself. We have built something here. Castile's voice matters.\"\n\nThe old abbot's expression darkens slightly.\n\n\"But the French will block any meaningful crusade authorization. They see Constantinople as a distraction from their true goal—reducing the Pope to a figurehead. And the procedural machinery...\" He shakes his head. \"Four deputations. Endless amendments. We measured it, Your Majesty. The electoral reform decree took six months from proposal to passage. Six months for a document about how to choose bishops.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes directly.\n\n\"What would you have us accomplish while you are gone? I will not promise what this Council cannot deliver.\""

Keep communication open with Castile and Juan\n5. He'll send outcome of Sigismund meeting\n\nAbbott Rodrigo will respond realistically - he's been at Basel 8 months, he knows the Council's limitations. He'll accept the instructions but be honest about prospects. This is a good moment for the delegation to respond.\n\nI should have Abbott Rodrigo respond, and possibly the others as well. Keep it relatively short - this is a departure scene, not a long strategic meeting.\n\nAbbott Rodrigo listens carefully, nodding slowly as you outline your strategy. When you finish, something shifts in his weathered face—not quite hope, but perhaps the shadow of it.\n\n\"Parallel texts. Pope adopts Council language, Council mirrors papal decree.\" He exchanges a glance with Bishop Alfonso. \"It is... elegant, Your Majesty. If it works, neither side can claim the other usurped authority. Both save face. Both act.\"\n\nBishop Alfonso speaks up, his tone measured. \"The pluralist reform decree is already passed. Session Twelve. If His Holiness adopts that text verbatim, it would be unprecedented—a Pope ratifying conciliar legislation without amendment. The symbolism alone...\" He trails off, considering. \"It could change everything. Or it could change nothing, if either side refuses to see it as cooperation rather than surrender.\"\n\n\"We will try,\" Abbott Rodrigo says simply. \"The crusade decree, we will push. The Germans are with us. Some Italians. But Your Majesty should know—\" He hesitates, then continues. \"The roll of the dice has already fallen against us on timing. The procedural obstacles are severe. If the decree passes at all, it may be months after your departure.\"\n\nFray Hernando steps forward. His voice is quieter than the others, meant for you alone but audible to all.\n\n\"You go to meet an Emperor, and then home to your wife. Both are right and necessary.\" His dark eyes hold yours. \"Remember what we discussed. The three questions. Pray on them daily, even on the road. Especially on the road, when you are far from anyone who will challenge you.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"I will write to you.

This is a significant request.\n\nLet me think about Fray Hernando's character and situation:\n- He's been at Basel for eight months leading the Castilian delegation\n- He's been consulted privately by Cardinal Cesarini three times\n- He's deeply concerned about Juan's spiritual state and messianic thinking\n- He refused Juan absolution earlier - unprecedented in their relationship\n- He assigned Juan three spiritual questions to pray on daily\n- He's committed to guiding Juan through this spiritual crisis\n\nFrom the NPC realism perspective, what would Fray Hernando actually want?\n\nOn one hand:\n- His primary role is as Juan's confessor and spiritual advisor\n- He's deeply concerned about Juan's soul and the messianic thinking pattern\n- Being away from Juan means he can't guide him through this crisis\n- The Constantinople journey will present enormous spiritual temptations (grand gestures, savior complex, etc.)\n- Juan needs him more than Basel does\n\nOn the other hand:\n- He's been instrumental at Basel - Cesarini consults him privately\n- The Castilian delegation's success is partly due to his presence\n- Leaving now might undermine what they've built\n- Abbott Rodrigo is 73 and weary - can he lead alone?\n- Bishop Alfonso is capable but Fray Hernando brings unique spiritual authority\n\nBut also:\n- Juan just made a major Constantinople commitment that could feed into messianic thinking\n- The journey to meet Sigismund, then Constantinople, are exactly the situations where Juan's impulses could run wild\n- Who will challenge Juan if Fray Hernando stays in Basel?\n- The whole point of the confessor relationship is to be present\n\nI think Fray Hernando would recognize that his primary duty is to Juan's soul, not to Basel politics. Bishop Alfonso can handle the theological debates. Abbott Rodrigo has the political experience. But no one else can do what Fray Hernando does for Juan.\n \nAfter careful deliberation, he'll likely agree to accompany Juan, understanding that spiritual guidance takes precedence over diplomatic proceedings. His commitment to Juan's spiritual well-being outweighs any institutional obligations at the Council.\n\nFray Hernando's expression shifts—surprise, then something more complex. He turns to look at Abbott Rodrigo and Bishop Alfonso, a silent conversation passing between the three men.\n\nAbbott Rodrigo speaks first, his voice dry. \"You would take my most valuable counselor, Your Majesty. Cardinal Cesarini will be... disappointed.\"\n\n\"The Cardinal will survive,\" Bishop Alfonso says quietly. \"I can manage the theological debates. It is what I do.\" He looks at Fray Hernando. \"The question is where you are most needed, brother.\"\n\nFray Hernando is silent for a long moment. The fire crackles. Outside, you can hear horses stamping in the courtyard, your escort preparing for departure.\n\nWhen he speaks, his voice is measured.\n\n\"I came to Basel because you sent me, Your Majesty. I stayed because the work was good and necessary. But my work...\" He pauses, choosing his words with care. \"My work has always been your soul. Not church politics. Not reform decrees. You.\"\n\nHe looks toward the window, toward the cathedral spire visible above the rooftops.\n\n\"Constantinople. You will go to the edge of Christendom, to a dying empire, carrying the weight of their hopes. Every man there will look at you as a savior. Every success will whisper that you are God's chosen instrument.\" His eyes return to yours, sharp and searching. \"That is precisely when you need someone who will tell you the truth.\"\n\nHe turns to Abbott Rodrigo. \"Can you manage without me?\"\n\nThe old abbot snorts. \"I managed church politics before you were born, brother. Alfonso and I will hold the line. Go. Keep our king's feet on the ground.\"\n\nFray Hernando nods slowly, then faces you again.\n\n\"I will come. But understand what you are asking. I will not soften my words because we are far from home. I will not spare you because emperors are watching. If anything, I will be harder on you, because the temptations will be greater.\"\n\nHe extends his hand—not to shake, but palm up, waiting.\n\n\"Promise me. Daily confession on the road. Honest examination. No hiding behind the press of events. Can you accept these terms?\""

Daily confession would be unusual even for very pious individuals.\n\n2. **What Fray Hernando has actually established**: Looking back at the chapters, he's had Juan do:\n- Regular confessions (not daily)\n- The three questions to pray on daily (not confess daily)\n- Spiritual examination and discussion\n\n3. **Fray Hernando's actual character**: He's rigorous but not unrealistic. He challenged Juan's presumption and refused absolution once, but he's not creating artificial burdens. He's a wise spiritual director, not a taskmaster.\n\n4. **What makes sense**: \n- Regular confessions on the journey (weekly or as needed)\n- Daily prayer on the three questions\n- Honest spiritual conversation and examination\n- Being available when Juan needs guidance\n\nThe player is correct - demanding DAILY confession is unrealistic and creates artificial drama. Fray Hernando would be more sophisticated than that. He'd want:\n- Regular access for confession when needed\n- Daily spiritual discipline (prayer, examination)\n- Honest conversation, not forced ritual\n\nI should correct this and have Fray Hernando ask for something more realistic that still maintains spiritual accountability without being theatrical.\n\nYou're absolutely right - daily confession is not realistic medieval practice and would be theatrically excessive rather than authentic spiritual direction.

Let me think through the realistic factors:\n\n**Success Factors (won't disappear):**\n1. Sigismund WANTS to meet Juan - his letters showed genuine interest and said he would \"seek you out personally at Basel\"\n2. Juan is moving quickly with a small, mobile party (33 crusaders + Fray Hernando + personal guard)\n3. Sigismund's route is somewhat predictable - north from Rome through the Italian Alps toward Basel/Germany\n4. Juan has good intelligence network and can ask for information at towns\n5. Sigismund travels with a large imperial court - highly visible, moves slowly\n6. The Alpine passes have limited routes - easier to intercept than open terrain\n\n**Failure Factors (won't disappear):**\n1. Sigismund might take an unexpected route (eastern passes vs. western)\n2. Weather could delay either party\n3. Miscommunication or bad intelligence about Sigismund's exact position\n4. Sigismund might stop for extended visits with Italian cities/lords\n5. Juan could miss him by taking parallel route\n6. Medieval travel timing is inherently uncertain\n\n**Roll determines:**\n- How quickly/easily they meet\n- Quality of the meeting circumstances (rushed roadside vs. proper setting)\n- Sigismund's mood/receptiveness\n- How much time they have together\n\nLet me create a realistic d100 table:\n\n1-15: Major problems - miss each other completely, have to turn back or wait at Basel\n16-35: Difficult meeting - takes week+, poor circumstances, brief encounter\n36-60: Standard success - meet within days, decent circumstances, good conversation\n61-85: Good success - intercept efficiently, excellent circumstances, extended discussions\n86-100: Exceptional - perfect timing, ideal setting, Sigismund deeply impressed, extended time together\n\nThe success factors are quite strong (Sigismund wants to meet, travels slowly, predictable route) but failure factors include medieval travel uncertainty and logistics. I'll weight this toward success but with realistic variance in quality.\n\nI'll create a d100 table for intercepting Emperor Sigismund. Let me first assess the factors:\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nSigismund explicitly said he would \"seek Juan out personally at Basel\" in his letters\n\nSigismund travels with large imperial court - slow, highly visible\n\nLimited Alpine routes from Rome to Germany - predictable path\n\nJuan has small, mobile party that can move quickly\n\nCan gather intelligence at towns about imperial procession's location\n\nSigismund genuinely wants this meeting\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nMedieval travel timing inherently uncertain\n\nSigismund might stop for extended visits with Italian lords/cities\n\nCould take different passes (eastern vs. western routes)\n\nWeather delays possible\n\nRisk of taking parallel routes and missing each other\n\nJuan's information could be outdated by days\n\nD100 TABLE: INTERCEPTING EMPEROR SIGISMUND\n\n1-10: Complete Miss\nYou take the western passes while Sigismund goes east through Venetian territory. By the time you learn this, he's already past. You must return to Basel or wait there for him - losing 2-3 weeks. Meeting happens eventually but circumstances are poor.\n\n11-25: Difficult Intercept\nTakes 7-10 days of hard riding and asking at every town. Finally catch him in northern Italy, but circumstances are rushed - he's pressed for time, you're both travel-weary. Brief roadside meeting, maybe one evening together. Functional but not ideal.\n\n26-50: Standard Success\n4-6 days of pursuing intelligence and riding south. Intercept him in the Italian Alps at a monastery or small city where he's resting. Good circumstances, a day or two together. Proper discussions possible. He's pleased you made the effort.\n\n51-70: Good Intercept\n3-4 days. Your information network works well - you learn his exact route and timing. Meet him at a comfortable alpine town. 2-3 days together with good accommodations. Excellent discussions. Sigismund impressed by your efficiency and dedication.\n\n71-85: Excellent Meeting\n2-3 days. Perfect intelligence and fast riding. Catch him at an ideal location - perhaps the monastery at Sankt Gotthard Pass or similar. 3-4 days together. Private chambers, good food, extended strategic discussions. Sigismund's advisors also present for detailed planning.\n\n86-100: Exceptional Encounter\nWithin 2 days, you intercept him at the perfect moment - arriving at a significant imperial stop (Pavia, Milan, or major monastery). He's delighted by your initiative and timing. Full week together with his court. Deep strategic partnership forms. Access to his Bohemian experts. He may even alter his schedule to spend more time with you.\n\nReady to roll when you are."

Keep it realistic - asking at towns, following the imperial procession's trail, and finally catching up.\n\nI need to avoid speculating about how the meeting will go or what kind of relationship will form - just get them to the meeting point with good circumstances.\n\nRoll: 56/100 - Good Timing\n\nThe road south from Basel winds through the Swiss cantons—green valleys giving way to steeper terrain as you approach the Alps. Your party moves swiftly: thirty-three crusaders, Fray Hernando, Captain Robles, and yourself. Small enough to make good time, large enough to be safe on the roads.\n\nDay 1 (June 2nd): You ride to Lucerne, asking at coaching inns and church houses. A Benedictine prior confirms: \"The Emperor passed through four days ago, heading toward Sankt Gotthard Pass. Large procession—imperial banners, sixty knights, wagons of documents.\"\n\nDay 2 (June 3rd): Push hard toward the alpine passes. At Altdorf, a merchant provides better intelligence: \"Emperor's at Bellinzona, south of the pass. Resting two days—his advisors are negotiating with Milan about safe passage through Lombard territory.\"\n\nDay 3 (June 4th): Over Sankt Gotthard Pass. The altitude makes breathing hard for men and horses alike. You descend the southern slopes into Italy proper. At evening, a messenger riding north confirms: \"Emperor left Bellinzona this morning, heading to Como. He stops there three days—meeting with the Archbishop and Milanese representatives.\"\n\nDay 4 (June 5th): Early morning ride. Como appears in the distance—a prosperous city on the lake's edge, alpine mountains rising behind it. Imperial banners fly from the Archbishop's palace near the cathedral.\n\nYou arrive at mid-afternoon.\n\nComo is bustling with the Emperor's presence. The Archbishop's palace guards recognize Castilian colors immediately—word of Granada's fall has spread even here. Within the hour, you're ushered into a comfortable receiving chamber.\n\nThe steward bows. \"Your Majesty of Castile. His Imperial Majesty will receive you within the hour. He has been expecting you—when scouts reported Castilian banners approaching, he said, 'Good. The crusader king does not disappoint.'\"\n\nThe steward gestures toward prepared chambers. \"The Archbishop has made rooms available. His Imperial Majesty's schedule allows for two, perhaps three days here before he continues to Basel. He has canceled two audiences to make time for you.\"\n\nThrough the windows, you can see Como's cathedral and the lake beyond, its waters mirror-smooth in the afternoon sun. Fray Hernando stands quietly nearby, saying nothing but observing everything.\n\nWhat do you do?"

      "summary": "Juan meets Emperor Sigismund privately at the Archbishop's palace in Como. Sigismund is blunt and skeptical, asking what Juan actually wants. A d100 roll (34 — Cautious Testing) sets the tone: Sigismund probes whether Juan has substance beyond grand words. Juan outlines his vision of cooperation for church unity, his Constantinople commitment (1,000 soldiers, 60,000 florins), and his parallel legislation proposal for church reform. A second roll (22 — Qualified Interest, Deep Skepticism) reveals Sigismund appreciates the church strategy but is deeply troubled by Juan's naive assumptions about Bohemia — particularly the idea that Hussite support would 'hopefully' fall away and church lands could be recovered 'without conflict.' Sigismund delivers a blunt education on the Hussite factions: moderate Utraquists who might negotiate, radical Taborites who never will, and the Orphans who know only war. He explains that the best realistic outcome is 'managed failure' — Utraquist reconciliation while accepting the permanent loss of church lands worth millions.",

          "text": "Thought process\n\nThe user wants me to read the NPC guide to ensure realism in the upcoming interaction with Emperor Sigismund. This is a critical encounter and needs to be handled with historical authenticity and realistic character motivations. Let me read that file.\n\n1. **Research Mandate**: If anything seems \"too easy,\" I need to use web_search to verify historical patterns\n2. **Identity/Self-Interest**: Sigismund is Holy Roman Emperor with his own interests, not just a supporting character\n3. **Loss Aversion**: He won't give up leverage easily\n4. **Face/Status**: He's the highest secular authority in Christendom - needs respect\n5. **Institutional Protection**: He protects the authority of the Imperial office\n6. **Universal Psychology**: Even if he likes Juan, self-interest processes first\n\nWhat does Sigismund actually want?\n- Solve the Bohemian Hussite problem (35 years of war)\n- Maintain Imperial authority\n- Prevent Ottoman threat\n- Resolve papal-conciliar crisis without weakening Imperial position\n- His legacy - he's getting older\n\nWhat are his concerns about Juan?\n- Unknown quantity - only heard of him recently\n- Very ambitious (just conquered Granada, now at Basel)\n- Might be seeking glory rather than substance\n- Could be politically naive about Council dynamics\n- Castile is far from Imperial concerns - why should he care?\n\nThis first meeting should be:\n- Sigismund testing Juan's character and competence\n- Juan proving he's not just another ambitious glory-seeker\n- Both sizing each other up\n- Possibility of friendship, but it needs to be EARNED through the conversation\n- Sigismund should be shrewd, experienced, slightly weary from decades of dealing with the Hussites\n\nI should NOT:\n- Make Sigismund immediately impressed and agreeable\n- Have him offer everything Juan wants\n- Make him a supporter just because Juan completed Reconquista\n- Ignore his own interests and concerns\n\nLet me portray the initial meeting realistically.\n\nYou dismiss your party. Captain Robles hesitates—his instinct is to stay close—but obeys. Fray Hernando simply nods and withdraws. The chamber falls quiet.\n\nYou wait alone.\n\nThe door opens without ceremony. No herald, no announcement. The man who enters is in his mid-sixties, tall but stooped slightly, with a lined face that speaks of decades spent managing impossible problems. His clothing is fine but travel-worn—he's been on the road for weeks. The imperial regalia is absent; this is not a formal audience.\n\nEmperor Sigismund of Luxembourg, King of Hungary, King of Bohemia, King of Germany, Holy Roman Emperor—crowned just five days ago in Rome—closes the door behind him and studies you with sharp, intelligent eyes that have seen thirty-five years of war with the Hussites, two decades of church schism, and more failed negotiations than most men witness in a lifetime.\n\nHe speaks in Latin, his voice gravelly with age. \"Juan of Castile. The crusader king who actually finished his crusade.\" There's no mockery in the tone, but no warmth either. Assessing. \"I received your letter from Basel. You rode hard to intercept me—your horses will need rest.\"\n\nHe moves to a chair without invitation, gestures for you to sit as well. The informality is deliberate—not an audience, but a conversation between men who both understand power.\n\n\"I have been crowned Emperor of an empire that barely listens to me. I rule Bohemia, which has spent thirty-five years telling me to go to hell. I lead Christendom's secular arm while Pope and Council tear each other apart over who actually leads the Church.\"\n\nHe leans back, studying you.\n\n\"And now a Spanish king—from a kingdom I have never visited, whose affairs have never touched mine—rides three days through the Alps to meet me on the road. You have my attention, Juan of Castile. But I have been disappointed by ambitious young kings before. So tell me: what do you actually want?\"\n\nThe question is blunt. Not hostile, but not friendly. The tone of a man who has heard too many grand promises and seen too few kept."

          "text": "**Who is Sigismund?**\n- 66 years old, Holy Roman Emperor just crowned\n- 35 years fighting Hussites in Bohemia (his own kingdom that won't obey him)\n- Watched church schism for decades\n- Experienced, cynical, has seen countless ambitious kings make grand promises\n- Actually wants to solve problems but has been burned many times\n- His letter to Juan was cautiously positive (\"perhaps in purpose\") but not committed\n\n**What are his interests/concerns?**\n- Bohemia is his nightmare - 35 years of war, can't solve it\n- Ottoman threat to Hungary (his other kingdom) is existential\n- Church crisis is tearing Christendom apart\n- He's old, running out of time, wants legacy\n- Desperately needs real allies, not more politicians\n- Wary of ambitious young kings with big ideas\n\n**Juan's approach analysis:**\n- Opens with \"I don't want anything from you\" - disarming, but is it true?\n- Immediately admits he DOES want things (honest)\n- Lists genuinely shared concerns: church unity, Muslim threats\n- \"Kingdom of God\" language - could be inspiring or suspicious (messianic?)\n- Proposes cooperation, not asking for help\n- \"What we cannot achieve on our own\" - acknowledges limitations\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- Juan actually completed a crusade (proved he can DO things, not just talk)\n- Sigismund did visit Pope, probably shares some concerns\n- The concerns Juan lists ARE real problems Sigismund faces\n- Approach is collaborative not demanding\n- Shows humility (\"outside my power\")\n- Acknowledges need for partnership\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- \"Kingdom of God\" language might sound messianic/naive\n- Sigismund has heard grand visions before from kings who didn't deliver\n- What does \"cooperation\" actually mean? Vague proposals are suspicious\n\n- Is Juan another ambitious king seeking imperial endorsement?\n- Sigismund's Bohemian nightmare makes him cynical about \"solving problems\"\n- He's been disappointed before\n\nI assess Juan's diplomatic approach as nuanced. He navigates Sigismund's deep skepticism by demonstrating genuine shared concerns and practical humility. The strategy balances honesty with strategic restraint, acknowledging mutual challenges without overreaching. His proven crusade experience adds credibility to his collaborative proposal, potentially cutting through the emperor's ingrained cynicism.\n\nThe conversation's success hinges on Juan's ability to translate grand vision into concrete diplomatic terms. Sigismund will meticulously evaluate every subtle indication of Juan's understanding, testing whether this young monarch comprehends the complex geopolitical landscape.\n\nI'll map potential interaction outcomes across escalating engagement levels, from dismissive to potentially transformative diplomatic alignment. Each range represents Sigismund's evolving perception of Juan's strategic maturity and genuine collaborative intent.\n\nLow ranges suggest skepticism - Juan appears as another idealistic ruler disconnected from harsh political realities. Moderate ranges indicate cautious interest, with Sigismund probing for substantive strategic depth. Higher ranges reveal increasing openness, where Juan's demonstrated accomplishments and authentic approach might genuinely intrigue the experienced warrior-diplomat.\n\nThe Granada campaign serves as a critical credibility marker. By completing a significant territorial negotiation, Juan demonstrates he's not merely theorizing but actively reshaping political dynamics. This practical achievement could significantly influence Sigismund's willingness to engage meaningfully.\n\nUltimately, Sigismund seeks evidence of strategic wisdom, humility, and genuine commitment to collaborative action beyond rhetorical promises.\n\nD100 TABLE: SIGISMUND'S INITIAL REACTION\n\nLet me analyze Juan's approach using the NPC Guide:\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nJuan actually completed his crusade (proves he delivers, not just talks)\n\nHonest admission of limitations (\"outside my power\")\n\nLists real shared concerns Sigismund faces (church crisis, Muslim threats)\n\nCollaborative framing, not asking for help\n\nOpening with \"I don't want anything\" is disarming\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\"Kingdom of God\" language could sound messianic/naive to cynical old warrior\n\nVague on specifics - what does \"cooperation\" actually mean?\n\nSigismund has heard grand visions from ambitious young kings before\n\n35 years of Bohemian nightmare has made him deeply skeptical\n\nWhat makes Juan different from other disappointed hopes?\n\nApproach Quality: COMPETENT - Honest and humble, but still somewhat abstract. Hasn't yet demonstrated understanding of Sigismund's specific nightmares.\n\n1-25: Polite Skepticism\nSigismund hears idealism from another young king who hasn't been ground down by reality. \"Kingdom of God\" sounds naive. He responds politely but without engagement - generic agreement that problems exist, but no opening for real conversation. Testing whether Juan has substance or just grand words. Cool, professional, guarded.\n\n26-45: Cautious Testing\nAppreciates honesty but remains skeptical. Sigismund asks pointed questions: \"What does cooperation actually mean? What can you deliver beyond words? I've heard 'unified Christendom' from a dozen kings—why should I believe you're different?\" Probing to see if Juan understands real complexity or just has visions. Not dismissive, but demanding proof of seriousness.\n\n46-65: Genuine Interest, Still Guarded\nSigismund recognizes Juan DID complete Granada—that matters. Actions speak. Engages more seriously, but wants to understand if Juan thinks strategically or just idealistically. Shares some of his own frustrations carefully. Real conversation begins, but he's still testing whether Juan grasps how hard these problems actually are. Waiting to see depth.\n\n66-80: Real Engagement\nThe combination of accomplishment and humility resonates. Sigismund opens up about his struggles—Bohemia, the church crisis, being ignored despite imperial title. Sees someone who acts rather than just talks. Willing to discuss specific possibilities. Still some wariness, but genuine interest in partnership. Wants to know Juan better before committing.\n\n81-95: Strong Connection\nDeeply impressed. Finally, a king who delivers AND admits limitations. Sigismund shares his burdens frankly—the weight of decades of failure, the exhaustion of trying to hold things together. Sees potential real ally. Opens meaningful strategic discussion. Still experienced enough not to make immediate commitments, but clearly moved.\n\n96-100: Profound Recognition\nSomething in Juan's combination—the completed crusade, the three-day ride, the humble words—strikes Sigismund deeply. He's old, tired, and has almost given up on finding kings with integrity. This feels different. Opens completely about his failures and hopes. Real possibility of deep partnership. Rare moment of connection between rulers who understand what power actually costs.\n\nReady to roll when you are."

He's going to ask pointed questions to test whether Juan understands real complexity or just has visions. He's probing to see if Juan is serious and different from other kings who have disappointed him. Not dismissive, but demanding proof of seriousness.\n\nI need to remember:\n- Sigismund is 65+, has dealt with 35 years of Hussite wars\n- He's heard grand promises from many kings\n- He's deeply skeptical but not closed off\n- He respects that Juan completed Granada\n- He wants to see if Juan thinks strategically or just idealistically\n- This is a test, not a rejection\n\nI should NOT have Juan speak or respond. I need to STOP after Sigismund speaks and wait for the player.\n\nRoll: 34/100 - Cautious Testing\n\nSigismund's expression doesn't change, but something shifts in his posture. He leans forward slightly, hands folded.\n\n\"The Kingdom of God.\" His tone is flat. \"I have been hearing about the Kingdom of God from ambitious kings for forty years. Usually right before they ask me to commit troops to their wars or recognize their territorial claims or help them against their enemies.\"\n\nHe stands, walks to the window overlooking Como's cathedral and the lake beyond. His back to you.\n\n\"You say you want a unified church. So does Pope Eugenius—with himself as absolute authority. So does the Council of Basel—with popes reduced to administrators. Both sides invoke God's will. Both claim they serve unity. Both are tearing Christendom apart.\"\n\nHe turns back, eyes hard.\n\n\"You say you want Christian realms defended against Muslim raids. Granada was real—I'll grant you that. You did what you said you would do. That matters.\" A pause. \"But Granada was your enemy at your border threatening your kingdom. Easy to be a crusader when the infidel is burning your villages.\"\n\nSigismund returns to his chair, sits heavily.\n\n\"The Ottomans sit at Hungary's borders. Have for decades. Where were the Christian kings when we begged for crusades? They sent letters of support and small contingents that went home after one season. We've been bleeding alone for thirty years.\"\n\nHis gaze is direct, unflinching.\n\n\"So tell me, Juan of Castile: What does 'cooperation' actually mean? What can you deliver beyond words and visions? I've heard 'unified Christendom' from a dozen kings. Why should I believe you're different from them?\"\n\nThe chamber is silent. Outside, you can hear bells ringing for vespers.\n\n\"Convince me you understand what you're actually proposing. Because 'Kingdom of God' is what priests say.

Admitted his own limitations and sins (\"We will always fail. I will fail.\")\n4. Showed he's learned from Basel - the church has corrupt members\n5. Most importantly: **Turned it around to ask Sigismund about his burdens**\n6. Specifically mentioned the Hussites - Sigismund's 35-year nightmare\n7. Showed spiritual evolution - used to think church = God's will, now more nuanced\n\nThis is much better than the opening. Juan has:\n- Proven action with concrete numbers\n- Shown humility and self-awareness\n- Asked about Sigismund's actual problems\n- Brought up the Hussites - the thing that has consumed Sigismund's reign\n\nNow I need to think about Sigismund's psychology:\n\n**Sigismund's Situation:**\n- 35 years fighting the Hussites, five crusades failed\n- The Hussites use war wagons, are militarily superior\n- They're not just heretics - they have legitimate grievances about church corruption\n- Sigismund has been caught between Rome's demands for orthodoxy and the reality that the Hussites have real points\n- He's exhausted, old, has mostly failed\n- Just crowned Emperor but the title is hollow - can't even control Bohemia\n- Desperate for someone who might actually understand the complexity\n\n**What would resonate with Sigismund:**\n- Juan admitting failure and sin (not claiming perfection)\n- Juan's evolved view that church members can be corrupt (this is Sigismund's problem!)\n- Juan actually asking about the Hussites instead of just pontificating\n- The concrete Constantinople commitment shows Juan acts, not just talks\n- Turning the conversation to Sigismund's burdens\n\n- Seeking genuine understanding of his complex challenges\n\nSigismund craves a nuanced perspective that acknowledges the profound difficulties of his position. He needs an ally who recognizes the intricate political and spiritual challenges he faces, rather than offering simplistic solutions or moral judgments.\n\nHis response reveals cautious hope - carefully testing Juan's capacity to comprehend the deeper layers of the Hussite conflict. He'll share strategic insights while maintaining emotional distance, probing whether Juan truly grasps the moral complexity of his situation.\n\nThe conversation becomes a delicate dance of trust-building, with Sigismund strategically revealing just enough to gauge Juan's authentic comprehension and potential support.\n\nSigismund's expression shifts. Something in your words—perhaps the admission of failure, perhaps the mention of Basel's effect on your faith, perhaps the simple question about his burdens—cracks the professional wariness.\n\nHe's quiet for a long moment.\n\n\"Constantinople.\" He nods slowly. \"A thousand men and sixty thousand florins. That's real. Not a letter promising prayers or twenty knights who'll leave after winter.\" He looks at you directly. \"Emperor John wrote me five years ago begging for aid. I sent three hundred Hungarians. They're still there—the ones who survived. Three hundred men to hold back the Sultan's armies while the rest of Christendom debates the Filioque.\"\n\nHe stands again, but this time there's less restlessness in the movement. More weight.\n\n\"You ask about the Hussites.\" A bitter laugh. \"Thirty-five years. Five crusades. All failures. Do you know why we lost, Juan? Not because they're better warriors—though their war wagons are damn effective. We lost because...\"\n\nHe turns to face you.\n\n\"Because they're right about half of what they say. The Church is corrupt. Priests do hold five benefices and visit none. Bishops do live like princes while peasants starve. Rome does drain Bohemia's wealth for Italian wars. When Jan Hus said these things, he spoke truth.\"\n\nSigismund's voice hardens.\n\n\"Then he denied transubstantiation. Then he claimed scripture alone suffices. Then his followers started taking communion in both kinds—claiming the same authority as priests. Then they seized Church lands worth millions. Then they butchered monks and burned monasteries.\"\n\nHe sits heavily.\n\n\"So tell me, Juan—where does legitimate reform end and heresy begin? How do you separate the wheat from the chaff? The French at Basel use 'reform' as a weapon against Rome. The Hussites use 'reform' to justify rebellion. Where is the actual Kingdom of God in all this?\"\n\nHis eyes meet yours—and for the first time, you see genuine exhaustion behind the imperial dignity.\n\n\"You say you would have joined my crusades as a younger man. Now you're less certain. Good. That makes you wiser than the popes who keep demanding I destroy the Hussites utterly while Rome's corruption is what created them in the first place.\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"What do I want that's outside my control? I want to end the Bohemian war without destroying Bohemia. I want the Church reformed without the Church destroyed. I want to stop the Ottomans without bleeding Hungary to death. I want...\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"I want one Christian king who understands that these problems don't have simple solutions. That sometimes the heretics have legitimate grievances. That sometimes reform requires admitting the Church failed. That power isn't about grand visions—it's about carrying impossible burdens for decades until you die.\"\n\nThe silence stretches.\n\n\"You rode three days to meet me. You admitted you will fail. You asked about my burdens instead of telling me about your glorious plans.\" His voice softens slightly. \"That's... unusual. So I'll ask you plainly: Why are you here, Juan?

He traveled to Rome for this coronation.\n\nHistorically:\n- Sigismund tried to mediate between Pope Eugenius IV and the Council of Basel\n- He was generally sympathetic to church reform but didn't want schism\n- He needed both papal legitimacy (for his imperial coronation) and conciliar cooperation (for dealing with Hussites)\n- He was frustrated with both sides - the Pope for being intransigent, the Council for being factional\n- He was primarily concerned with ending the Hussite wars, which required some kind of church settlement\n- The Hussites would only negotiate if they felt the Church was genuinely reforming\n\nSigismund would be:\n- Recently grateful to Eugenius for the coronation (happened 5 days ago)\n- But also frustrated that Eugenius won't attend Basel\n- Skeptical of Basel's factionalism (French trying to dominate)\n- Desperate for any solution that lets him negotiate with moderate Hussites\n- Tired of both sides using him as a tool in their power struggle\n\nLet me have him answer honestly about this complex situation.\n\nSigismund considers the question, then gives a short, harsh laugh.\n\n\"My relationship with the Pope.\" He shakes his head. \"Five days ago, Eugenius placed the imperial crown on my head in Rome. Beautiful ceremony. Solemn oaths. He called me the secular sword of Christendom, defender of the faith.\"\n\nHe stands, paces.\n\n\"Before that? He kept me waiting two years for the coronation. Two years of negotiations, conditions, demands. He wanted guarantees I'd support him against Basel. Wanted me to force the Council to submit. I kept saying: 'Holy Father, I need both of you to help me end the Bohemian war.' He kept saying: 'First, bring the Council to heel.'\"\n\nSigismund turns to face you.\n\n\"Eugenius is not Martin V. Martin understood politics—you could negotiate with him, find compromises. Eugenius...\" A pause. \"Eugenius believes absolutely in papal supremacy. The Council exists to advise, not to govern. Any talk of Haec Sancta being permanent law enrages him. He sees Basel as rebellion that must be crushed.\"\n\nHe returns to his seat.\n\n\"And Basel? The Council fathers invoke Haec Sancta like it's scripture. 'Councils are superior to popes, directly from Christ.' The French want to reduce the papacy to nothing—make the Pope a figurehead who obeys conciliar decrees. Cardinal Aleman's faction would depose Eugenius tomorrow if they had the votes.\"\n\nHis expression darkens.\n\n\"Both sides tell me I must choose. The Pope says: 'You're Emperor—command the Council to submit.' Basel says: 'You're Emperor—make the Pope attend and obey our decrees.' And I tell them both: 'I'm Emperor of an empire that barely listens to me. I have no power to command either of you.'\"\n\nSigismund leans back.\n\n\"What do I support? I support ending this madness before we have two popes again. I support reforms that address real corruption—pluralism, absenteeism, simony. The Session Twelve decree Basel passed is good law. It should be implemented.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"But I also believe the Church needs a strong pope. Not a tyrant, but not a figurehead either. Spiritual authority requires spiritual leadership. Committees don't provide that.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"So I've been trying to mediate. Get Eugenius to accept some conciliar authority. Get Basel to acknowledge papal primacy. Find middle ground. But neither side wants middle ground—they want total victory.\"\n\nHis voice grows quieter.\n\n\"And meanwhile, the Hussites watch. The moderate Utraquists came to Basel because they genuinely want reconciliation. But they'll only negotiate if they believe the Church is actually reforming—that their grievances are heard. If Pope and Council are at war, the Hussites see it as proof the Church is irredeemably corrupt.\"\n\nSigismund looks at you directly.\n\n\"So no, Juan, I don't have a simple position. I need both Pope and Council to survive. I need reforms to happen. I need the Bohemian war to end. And I have no power to make any of it happen.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"Now. You asked about my relationship with the Church. I've told you. Your turn: Why are you asking?\""

This factionalism serves no-one.\n\n\nAppealing to man's better nature is always good, but I have learned that real power often speaks much more strongly than just words.\n\n\nWhen I spoke with the pope he understood that reform was needed, but he did not want to bow down to the power of the council. He is more concerned about his position than he is with reforming the church.\n\n\nI have found a way for him to support the reform without losing authority over the council. I have with me a copy of the reforms passed by the council the pope can pass the exact same decree on his own initiative. He is not acknowledging the authority of the council, but the decree on reforms has been passed anyway.\n\n\nI would also like to make clear that the church will have to find a way stay united. And that there are limits to the pope's military might and support. I lend my sword to christendom but I refure to fight for more wealth for bishops. I actually think that recognizing haec sancta would to wonders to unite the church, even though that might not be realistic right now.\n\n\nThere should be a pope, but the church is simply too large now to be ruled by any single person. It would be a strong signal if you support this position as well. If both you, who are emperor of all lands north of rome and I who through my alliance control the lands to the south, speak with one voice in these matters, we might achieve what we individually might not.\n\n\nI was hoping that if we can adopt a position together, we might put more pressure on the church to be united. Since we want the same outcome. Push through reforms using this system. Declare a crusade against the Ottomans. When the church is reformed in this way, much support for the hussites hopefully falls away as well. If there are still nobles who have used the rebellion for their own personal gain, we can demand their lands back, hopefully without conflict.\n\n\nThat is what I hope for.\n\n\nDraft a d100 table to see how the emperor reacts."

          "text": "**What Juan is proposing:**\n1. Pope passes Council reforms as his own initiative (parallel legislation)\n2. Both Sigismund and Juan jointly pressure the Church to accept this system\n3. Recognition that Haec Sancta has merit (even if not realistic now)\n4. Joint declaration/pressure for crusade against Ottomans\n5. Once church reformed, Hussite support falls away\n6. Then demand seized Church lands back \"hopefully without conflict\"\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- Juan actually understands Sigismund's nightmare (Bohemia, Church crisis, Ottomans)\n- Concrete mechanism (parallel legislation) not just vague words\n- Recognizes limits of papal military power\n- Acknowledges Haec Sancta has some legitimacy (big concession)\n- Offers real partnership based on combined leverage (north + south of Rome)\n- Shows understanding that single-person rule impossible for modern Church\n- Juan has proven he delivers (Granada)\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- \"Hopefully without conflict\" for Church lands is NAIVE. This is worth millions, held by nobles who've fought 5 crusades to keep it. Sigismund knows this won't be peaceful.\n- Assumes Hussite support falls away with reform - but they've invested 35 years, massive sunk costs\n- Assumes Pope will accept parallel legislation - but Eugenius is absolutist, may see this as trick\n- Juan's leverage is theoretical (Naples alliance not secured yet)\n- What if Pope refuses? What if Council refuses? What's the enforcement mechanism?\n- This is a very optimistic timeline - reform → crusade → Hussite collapse → lands returned peacefully\n- Juan is young (27), Sigismund has seen too many optimistic plans fail\n\n**Self-Interest Check for Sigismund:**\n- Does get: potential powerful ally, pressure mechanism for Church unity\n- Does lose: nothing immediate, but commits to confrontational stance toward both Pope and Council\n\n- Risk of appearing weak if the plan collapses, potentially alienating key political factions\n\n**Red Flags and Realistic Assessment:**\nJuan's proposal reveals strategic insight but lacks critical pragmatism. The \"hopefully without conflict\" approach signals youthful inexperience. While innovative, the plan oversimplifies complex ecclesiastical and political dynamics. Sigismund will likely see potential but also significant structural weaknesses that could undermine the entire strategy.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\nThe approach demonstrates nuanced understanding of church politics, yet fails to fully grasp Bohemian territorial complexities. Juan's proposal balances sophisticated political thinking with naive optimism, creating a mixed diplomatic landscape that intrigues but does not fully convince.\n\n**Potential Outcomes:**\nEngagement ranges from cautious interest to measured skepticism. Success probability sits between 35-40%, depending on Sigismund's interpretation of Juan's strategic depth and potential for adaptation.\n\n**Diplomatic Trajectory:**\nSigismund will methodically dissect the proposal, appreciating innovative elements while systematically highlighting unrealistic assumptions about regional dynamics. The interaction becomes an educational moment, transforming initial proposal into a more refined strategic framework.\n\n**Partnership Evolution:**\nJuan's strategic thinking gradually impresses Sigismund. Despite early skepticism, he recognizes genuine potential. The relationship shifts from cautious evaluation to committed collaboration, with Sigismund investing significant intellectual and strategic capital in guiding Juan's understanding.\n\n**Strategic Alignment:**\nBy the final stages, Sigismund sees Juan as a rare strategic partner - someone capable of learning, adapting, and executing complex political maneuvers. The alliance transcends initial reservations, becoming a profound intellectual and political partnership built on mutual respect and strategic vision.\n\nD100 TABLE: SIGISMUND'S REACTION TO PARTNERSHIP PROPOSAL\n\nLet me analyze Juan's approach using the NPC Guide:\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nConcrete mechanism (parallel legislation), not vague promises\n\nJoint leverage strategy (north + south of Rome unified)\n\nAcknowledges Haec Sancta legitimacy (significant concession)\n\nUnderstands Pope's real concern (authority, not reform substance)\n\nRecognizes Church too large for single-person rule (sophisticated)\n\nCombined crusade against Ottomans (addresses Sigismund's nightmare)\n\nJuan has proven track record (Granada delivered)\n\nFailure Factors:\n\n\"Hopefully without conflict\" for Church lands is PROFOUNDLY NAIVE - these lands worth millions, nobles fought 5 crusades to keep them\n\nAssumes Hussite support \"falls away\" with reform - ignores 35 years of sunk costs, blood, martyrs\n\nOversimplifies: reform → crusade → Hussite collapse → peaceful land return\n\nJuan's leverage partly theoretical (Naples alliance not secured)\n\nWhat if Pope refuses parallel legislation? What if Council rejects it? No enforcement mechanism discussed\n\nTimeline is optimistic\n\nShows Juan doesn't fully grasp Bohemian complexity\n\nApproach Quality: GOOD BUT REVEALS NAIVETY - Strong on church politics, weak on Bohemian reality. The \"hopefully without conflict\" line will be a red flag to Sigismund that Juan doesn't understand what he's actually proposing for Bohemia.\n\n1-20: Disappointment Sets In\nJuan sounded wise initially but revealed fundamental misunderstanding of Bohemia. \"Hopefully without conflict\" shows he has no idea what he's talking about—those lands are worth everything, held by nobles who've bled for them for decades. Sigismund expected better. He responds politely but distantly, another young king with grand plans that ignore reality. Minimal engagement, no commitment.\n\n21-40: Qualified Interest, Deep Skepticism\nAppreciates parallel legislation idea and combined leverage concept, but deeply troubled by Bohemian naivety. Points out problems bluntly: \"You think nobles will surrender fortunes 'hopefully without conflict'? You think reform makes 35 years of Hussite sacrifice disappear?\" Willing to discuss church strategy, but won't commit to partnership if Juan doesn't understand what he's proposing. Testing whether Juan can learn.\n\n41-60: Serious Engagement, Reality Check Needed\nImpressed by church politics understanding, concerned about Bohemian blindness. Will work through plan systematically—praising what's sound, dissecting what's naive. Sees potential partnership but Juan needs education on Bohemian complexity first. \"The church plan is good. The Bohemian plan will get people killed and solve nothing.\" Conditional interest if Juan proves teachable.\n\n61-75: Strong Partnership, Educational Partnership\nJuan's overall strategic thinking sound even if some assumptions naive. Sigismund commits to joint church pressure while firmly correcting Bohemian misconceptions. Real alliance forming—but Juan must understand: Church lands won't return peacefully, Hussite problem won't vanish with reform. Partnership based on Juan learning hard truths. Opens up about Bohemian complexity.\n\n76-90: Deep Alliance Despite Naivety\nJuan's combination of delivery (Granada) and strategic sophistication (parallel legislation, combined leverage) outweighs naive Bohemian assumptions. Sigismund commits strongly to partnership, will share detailed intelligence, work as true allies. Still corrects naive parts but sees someone capable of learning. Finally found a king who thinks strategically AND acts. Worth investing in despite gaps in understanding.\n\n91-100: Profound Partnership\nSigismund overlooks naive assumptions because overall approach is extraordinarily sound. Juan understands church politics better than most cardinals, offers real power partnership, and proved he delivers. Commits fully—opens completely about strategies, failures, fears. Sees Juan as the partner he's searched for decades. Will personally mentor Juan on Bohemian complexity. Real brotherhood of rulers who understand burden of power.\n\nReady to roll when you are."

Sigismund appreciates the parallel legislation idea and combined leverage, but is deeply troubled by Juan's naivety about Bohemia. He'll point out the problems bluntly about nobles surrendering fortunes and Hussite sacrifice disappearing. He's willing to discuss church strategy but won't commit to partnership if Juan doesn't understand what he's proposing. Testing whether Juan can learn.\n\nI need to roleplay Sigismund as:\n- Appreciating the church strategy (parallel legislation, combined leverage)\n- Deeply skeptical about the Bohemian plan\n- Blunt about pointing out the flaws\n- Not dismissive but testing Juan - can he learn?\n- Willing to engage on church matters but cautious about full partnership\n\nThe key line that will trigger Sigismund is \"hopefully without conflict\" regarding Church lands. That's where he'll know Juan doesn't understand Bohemia at all.\n\nRoll: 22/100 - Qualified Interest, Deep Skepticism\n\nSigismund listens without interruption. When you finish, he's silent for a long moment. His expression is complicated—interest warring with something darker.\n\n\"The parallel legislation.\" He nods slowly. \"That's clever. Eugenius passes the reform on his own authority, same text as Basel. Neither side subordinates. Both can claim victory.\" A pause. \"Combined pressure from north and south—yes, that could work. The church strategy is sound.\"\n\nHe stands, walks to the window again. His shoulders are tense.\n\n\"But then you said something that tells me you don't understand what you're proposing.\" He turns back, and his voice is harder. \"You think that after reform, 'support for the Hussites hopefully falls away' and we can 'demand their lands back, hopefully without conflict.'\"\n\nSigismund crosses the room in three strides, stops directly in front of you.\n\n\"Juan. Listen carefully. Those Church lands are worth millions of florins. Not thousands—millions. Every major Bohemian noble family holds estates they seized from monasteries. They've held them for twenty years. They've built their power on them. They've married their children using the wealth from them.\"\n\nHis voice rises slightly.\n\n\"You think they'll just... give them back? 'Hopefully without conflict'? These are men who've fought five crusades to keep those lands. Men who've buried sons defending them. Men whose entire position depends on never surrendering them.\"\n\nHe returns to his chair, sits heavily.\n\n\"And the Hussites themselves—you think reform makes thirty-five years of blood disappear? They've lost fathers, brothers, sons fighting for this cause. Jan Hus burned at the stake. Thousands died at Kutná Hora, at Ústí, at Tachov. Martyrs whose names every Hussite child knows.\"\n\nSigismund leans forward.\n\n\"Reform doesn't erase that. Reform doesn't bring back the dead. The moderate Utraquists might—might—negotiate if Rome grants communion in both kinds and stops the persecution. But getting the Church lands back?\" He shakes his head. \"That requires either overwhelming military force or accepting they're lost forever. There is no 'hopefully without conflict.'\"\n\nThe silence stretches. Outside, the lake is turning dark as evening falls.\n\n\"So here's my question, Juan of Castile.\" His voice is quieter now, but intense. \"You understand church politics better than half the cardinals I know. You've built a real strategic framework. You actually completed a crusade when others just talk.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Can you learn? Can you hear me when I tell you Bohemia is more complicated than 'reform then peace'? Or are you like every other ambitious king—brilliant about your own plans, deaf to realities that don't fit your vision?\"\n\nHis eyes are direct, uncompromising.\n\n\"Because I'll work with you on the church strategy. That's good thinking. But I won't commit to full partnership with someone who thinks we can solve the Bohemian nightmare with reforms and hope. That's how thousands more die for nothing.\"\n\n\"Show me you can hear hard truths. Tell me: what do you actually understand about the Bohemian situation? Not what you hope—what you know?\""

Juan proposes a joint declaration supporting church reform, and a d100 roll (41 — Conditional Agreement) means Sigismund agrees in principle but insists on shaping the text himself. He demands three modifications: electoral reform language that preserves traditional imperial influence over prince-elector archbishops (Mainz, Trier, Cologne); stronger annates provisions with a one-quarter cap rather than vague 'reduce and standardize'; and language supporting Bohemian reconciliation including communion in both kinds. Fray Hernando is summoned to present the Castilian reform proposals and joins the working session. A further roll (27 — Wants Modifications First) on signing confirms Sigismund will only sign after real negotiation of the text. Sigismund explains the history of Pope Eugenius IV's election and why he became a hardliner. Extended discussions cover the mechanics of annates, episcopal elections, and institutional accountability. Juan briefly overreaches by proposing Council authority to dismiss popes, but quickly recognizes this contradicts his stated neutrality on Haec Sancta and adjusts to proposing internal church oversight mechanisms instead — a standing commission with transparency and audit powers but no supremacy over the papacy.",

From what I have been told, I know that the hussites fight with conviction because of lack of reform. If we grant them communion in both kinds and some other reforms as well, this will hopefully diminish their zeal. The rebellion has been so successful because the rebels have something to fight for and the papal states and their crusades are viewed as tyrannical, opressive and unjust. Take that away from them and what do they have left?\n\n\nI hope that from that situation, we can find a way to adress the greed by Bohemian nobles who have used the rebellion to enrich themselves. I cannot see exactly what that would look like, maybe that is looking too far into the future. But it underlines the importance for the church to reform.

          "text": "Juan is being humble and honest here - admitting his knowledge is second-hand, explaining his reasoning, and acknowledging he can't see exactly how to solve the land problem. He's showing he can hear hard truths and is open to learning.\n\nThis is a good response that addresses Sigismund's challenge. Let me think about how Sigismund would react:\n\n1. Juan admits ignorance - good, shows humility\n2. Juan's understanding is actually partially correct - reform DOES diminish zeal for moderates\n3. Juan acknowledges he can't solve the land problem - honest\n4. \"First take moral high ground, then look what to do next\" - strategic, not naive\n5. Juan is operating on assumptions, admits it\n\nSigismund asked \"can you learn? Can you hear hard truths?\" Juan is demonstrating he can. He's not defending a naive position - he's saying \"I don't know, but here's my reasoning, educate me.\"\n\nThis should be a positive moment. Sigismund was testing whether Juan would double down on naive assumptions or show intellectual humility. Juan showed humility.\n\nI don't think I need a d100 roll here - this is Juan demonstrating the quality Sigismund was testing for. The roll already happened (22 - qualified interest, deep skepticism). Now Juan is responding to that skepticism with humility and openness to learning.\n\nSigismund should:\n1. Acknowledge Juan passed the test - he CAN hear hard truths\n2. Share more about Bohemian reality since Juan is receptive\n3. Explain the factions (Utraquists vs Taborites vs Orphans)\n4. Explain that moderates MIGHT negotiate, radicals never will\n5. Explain the land problem is truly intractable\n6. Start building toward real partnership now that trust is established\n\nLet me write Sigismund's response showing this shift.\n\nSigismund's posture shifts. The hard edge in his expression softens—not to warmth, not yet, but to something like grudging respect.\n\n\"Second-hand at best.\" He repeats the words slowly. \"Do you know how rare that is? To hear a king admit he doesn't know something?\"\n\nHe leans back, studying you differently now.\n\n\"Alright. You can hear. So let me teach you what thirty-five years has taught me about Bohemia.\"\n\nHe holds up one finger.\n\n\"First: there is no single 'Hussite' movement. There are factions. The Utraquists—the moderates—they want communion in both kinds, vernacular preaching, reform of clerical abuses. Many are sincere Catholics who believe Rome has strayed. These men might negotiate. They came to Basel because they want reconciliation.\"\n\nA second finger.\n\n\"Then there are the Taborites. The radicals. They've gone far beyond reform—they reject the Real Presence, reject the priesthood itself, reject almost everything Rome teaches. They've built their own society, their own theology, their own identity. Reform won't bring them back. Nothing will bring them back. They've become something new.\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"And the Orphans—followers of Jan Žižka after his death. Warriors who've known nothing but war for twenty years. Fighting is what they are now. Peace threatens their very identity.\"\n\nHe drops his hand.\n\n\"You're right that reform weakens the moral position of the radicals. If Rome grants communion in both kinds, the Utraquists lose their main grievance. Some will reconcile. But the Taborites and Orphans? They'll call the Utraquists traitors. They'll keep fighting. And the Utraquist nobles who hold Church lands?\"\n\nSigismund shakes his head.\n\n\"They'll take the religious reconciliation and keep the lands. They'll say: 'We've made peace with Rome, the war is over, these lands are ours by right of twenty years' possession.' And legally? They might be right. There's a principle—praescriptio—that long possession creates legitimate title.\"\n\nHe stands, moves to a side table where wine has been set out. Pours two cups, hands one to you without asking.\n\n\"So here's the truth, Juan. The best outcome—the best—is this: Utraquists reconcile with Rome. They keep most of the lands because we can't take them back without another war we'd probably lose. Taborites and Orphans remain hostile but isolated, slowly weakening over decades without Utraquist support. The Church accepts it lost millions in Bohemia forever but gains peace.\"\n\nHe drinks.\n\n\"That's not victory. That's managed failure. That's what thirty-five years of war has reduced my hopes to.\"\n\nSigismund sits again, wine cup in hand, eyes on you.\n\n\"Now you understand better. The moral high ground matters—you're right about that. Reform first, then negotiate from strength. But 'strength' in Bohemia means accepting losses that would make your Spanish bishops weep. Can you support that? Can you tell the Pope that saving the Church in Bohemia means accepting that the Church lost Bohemia's wealth forever?\""

Juan's approach balances ambition with pragmatism, carefully addressing potential obstacles while offering a measured path forward. The joint declaration represents a calculated diplomatic maneuver that could potentially break the current ecclesiastical deadlock.\n\nD100 TABLE: SIGISMUND'S RESPONSE TO JOINT DECLARATION PROPOSAL\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nJuan demonstrated he can learn and listen (huge in Sigismund's eyes)\n\nConcrete, actionable proposal - not vague hopes\n\n\"Re-assess after reforms\" shows strategic patience\n\nAligns with Sigismund's stated goals (reform without destroying Church)\n\nCombined leverage is real - Emperor + Castile-Aragon-Naples bloc\n\nDual legislation sidesteps authority question elegantly\n\nSigismund has been seeking exactly this kind of partnership\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nSigismund's actual leverage is limited - he said himself \"I have no power to command\"\n\nFrench faction at Basel has own agenda, won't follow two kings' lead\n\nPope might see joint declaration as threat, harden position rather than yield\n\nWhat's the enforcement mechanism if either side refuses?\n\nSigismund has tried mediating for years - why would this succeed?\n\nJoint declaration commits Sigismund publicly - risk of exposure if it fails\n\nCouncil factions deeply entrenched, declaration may change nothing\n\nApproach Quality: GOOD - Focused, concrete, patient. Juan showed he learned from Bohemian lecture by not overpromising.\n\n1-20: Too Cautious to Commit\nDecades of failed initiatives have made Sigismund gun-shy. Appreciates the thinking but won't put his name to something that might fail publicly. Offers vague support without formal commitment. \"I'll consider it\" means \"probably not.\"\n\n21-40: Interested But Demanding Specifics\nLikes the direction but needs concrete answers before committing. What exactly does declaration say? How do we present it without appearing to threaten the Pope? What if French faction rejects it? Won't sign anything until these questions answered. Partnership possible but requires more work.\n\n41-60: Conditional Agreement\nWilling to pursue joint declaration if they can agree on precise wording and approach. Wants to shape the text himself—not just sign Juan's draft. Insists on careful framing that pressures both Pope AND radical conciliarists. Real negotiation begins over specifics.\n\n61-75: Genuine Partnership Forming\nSigismund sees this as the breakthrough he's sought. Commits to working on joint declaration together. Shares his own ideas about framing and timing. Discusses who at Basel and Rome might support this. Treats Juan as genuine strategic partner. Still cautious about details but fundamentally committed.\n\n76-90: Strong Alliance\nJuan's combination of learning, concrete thinking, and proven delivery convinces Sigismund this could actually work. Commits fully to joint declaration. Opens up about his own contacts and strategies. Begins detailed planning—timing, messengers, who to approach first. Real trust developing.\n\n91-100: Complete Strategic Partnership\nSigismund has waited decades for a partner like this. Commits enthusiastically, shares everything—his failures, his remaining leverage, his secret communications with moderate factions. They work as true equals planning the declaration together.

First: what specific reforms do we name? Pluralism, yes—that's easy. Simony, clerical taxation, episcopal elections. But do we mention Haec Sancta? Do we acknowledge conciliar authority at all? That's where it gets dangerous.\"\n\nA second finger.\n\n\"Second: how do we present this? A public declaration at Basel? A private letter to the Pope first, giving him chance to act before we go public? The sequencing matters enormously. Get it wrong and Eugenius sees conspiracy against him.\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"Third: what do we actually threaten? Declarations without consequences are ignored. You mentioned limits to papal military support. Are you willing to say that publicly? That Castile won't fight wars for unreformed bishops? Because that would get attention—but it would also make enemies.\"\n\nHe drops his hand, eyes fixed on yours.\n\n\"I've tried to mediate this crisis for two years, Juan. I've failed because I had no leverage—just an imperial title that no one respects. You offer real leverage. But leverage misused is worse than no leverage at all.\"\n\nSigismund gestures between you.\n\n\"So. Let's draft something together. Here, now, while we have two or three days. Not a final text—but a framework we both agree on. If we can find words that satisfy us both, I'll sign. If we can't...\"\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n\"Then we part as friendly kings who couldn't quite align. No shame in that. But I won't put my name to something half-formed that might make things worse.\"\n\nHe pulls a chair closer to the writing desk, gestures for you to join him.\n\n\"Come. Let's see if we can actually agree on what 'reform' means when you have to write it down.\"\n\nThe evening light is fading. Servants appear at the door—Sigismund waves them away without looking. This conversation, it seems, is not finished.\n\nWhat do you do?"

          "text": "Juan is asking a historical question about how Pope Eugenius IV came to be elected after Pope Martin V. This is a good question that deserves a historically accurate answer.\n\nLet me think about what I know about this:\n\nPope Martin V was elected at the Council of Constance in 1417, ending the Western Schism. He was indeed politically savvy and managed to navigate the complex situation between papal authority and conciliar claims.\n\nPope Eugenius IV (Gabriel Condulmer) was elected in March 1431. He was a Venetian and an Augustinian canon. His election came after Martin V's death on February 20, 1431.\n\nThe conclave that elected Eugenius IV was influenced by several factors:\n1. The cardinals wanted someone who would not continue Martin V's nepotism (Martin had enriched his Colonna family significantly)\n2. Eugenius was seen as pious and reform-minded\n3. He was required to sign a capitulation (election agreement) promising to share power with the cardinals and to continue the council\n4. The cardinals may have underestimated how strongly he would assert papal authority once elected\n\nEugenius IV turned out to be more of a papalist hardliner than expected. He attempted to dissolve the Council of Basel shortly after his election (in December 1431), which backfired badly and forced him to retreat.\n\nSigismund would know all this history firsthand - he was at Constance, he's been dealing with Eugenius for two years now.\n\nLet me have Sigismund explain this in character - with the weariness and cynicism of someone who has watched these church politics play out for decades.\n\nAlso, Fray Hernando is being summoned to bring the Castilian reform documents. I should have him enter and present the documents briefly.\n\nSigismund nods at your signal, and a servant is dispatched. Within minutes, Fray Hernando enters—his expression carefully neutral, though his eyes take in the scene quickly: two rulers at a writing desk, wine cups, the informal intimacy of genuine negotiation.\n\n\"Your Majesty. Your Imperial Majesty.\" He bows to each in turn.\n\n\"The Castilian reform proposals, Fray Hernando,\" you say. \"The documents our delegation has been working from at Basel.\"\n\nFray Hernando produces a leather folio from his robes—he's been carrying it, you realize, anticipating this moment. He sets it on the desk and steps back, waiting.\n\nSigismund glances at the documents but doesn't reach for them yet. Your question about Eugenius has caught his attention.\n\n\"How did a papalist hardliner follow Martin?\" He laughs bitterly. \"Because the cardinals are fools who thought they could control him.\"\n\nHe stands, pacing as he explains.\n\n\"Martin died in February of thirty-one. The conclave met. The cardinals were tired of Colonna nepotism—Martin had enriched his family shamelessly. They wanted someone pious, someone manageable. Gabriel Condulmer—Eugenius—seemed perfect. A Venetian monk. Austere. No powerful family backing him. They made him sign a capitulation before the election: promises to share power with the college, continue the council, limit papal authority.\"\n\nSigismund's expression sours.\n\n\"Then he was elected. And within months, he tried to dissolve Basel entirely. Declared the Council illegitimate. Ordered everyone home.\"\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"It was a disaster. The Council refused. Invoked Haec Sancta. Threatened to depose him like Constance deposed the schism popes. Eugenius had to back down—publicly humiliated. He's been fighting to recover ever since.\"\n\nSigismund returns to the desk.\n\n\"So now you understand him. He's not a hardliner by nature—he's a hardliner because he tried to crush Basel and failed. Every concession now feels like another defeat. Every reform looks like the Council claiming victory over him. He's backed into a corner of his own making.\"\n\nHe taps the table.\n\n\"That's why your approach might actually work. You're not asking him to submit to Basel. You're offering him a way to lead the reform—to claim credit for it. Parallel legislation lets him save face.\" A pause. \"But he'll need persuading that this isn't another trap. He's been burned before.\"\n\nSigismund finally reaches for the Castilian documents, spreading them on the desk.\n\n\"Now. Let's see what your delegation has proposed. And then we draft these letters—one to Eugenius, one to our allies at Basel.\"\n\nHe looks up at you.\n\n\"Fray Hernando stays? He knows the Council's mood better than either of us.\""

Let me reference what I know from the summaries:\n- Pluralism reform (holding multiple benefices)\n- Electoral reform for bishops\n- Simony\n- Clerical taxation\n- Absenteeism\n\nI'll have Fray Hernando present a realistic set of reform proposals that Castile would support, drawing on historical Basel reforms and the campaign context.\n\nFray Hernando moves to the desk, his worn hands spreading the documents with the care of a man who has spent months working on them.\n\n\"Your Majesty. Your Imperial Majesty.\" He glances between you. \"Our delegation arrived at Basel with instructions to support meaningful reform while preserving Church unity. We have worked within the deputation system, building coalitions where possible.\"\n\nHe separates the documents into groups.\n\n\"The reforms fall into several categories. Some have already passed. Others are still being debated.\"\n\nFirst group:\n\n\"Pluralism and absenteeism. Session Twelve addressed this directly—the decree limiting how many benefices one cleric may hold.\" He taps the document. \"Under the old practice, a single bishop might hold three or four dioceses, visiting none, collecting income from all. The decree restricts this sharply. One man, one major benefice. Exceptions require papal dispensation with genuine cause.\"\n\nSigismund nods. \"I've read it. Good law. The question is enforcement.\"\n\n\"Precisely, Your Imperial Majesty. Which leads to the second reform.\"\n\nSecond group:\n\n\"Episcopal elections. This has been... contentious.\" Fray Hernando chooses his words carefully. \"The decree restores electoral rights to cathedral chapters. Bishops chosen by their clergy, not appointed by Rome in exchange for payment.\"\n\nHe glances at Sigismund. \"This threatens papal revenue directly. Every appointment sold is income lost. But it also addresses one of the Hussites' core grievances—bishops imposed from outside who care nothing for their flocks.\"\n\nThird group:\n\n\"Annates and taxation. The fees paid to Rome upon receiving a benefice.\" Fray Hernando's expression tightens. \"This is where the French have been most aggressive. They want annates abolished entirely. Our position has been more moderate—reduce them, standardize them, but not eliminate papal revenue completely. A weakened papacy serves no one.\"\n\nFourth group:\n\n\"Simony—the sale of Church offices and sacraments.\" He shakes his head. \"Everyone agrees it is sinful. No one agrees on enforcement. We have supported clear penalties: removal from office, excommunication. But who enforces? The Pope? The bishops who bought their positions? The Council that has no army?\"\n\nFray Hernando steps back slightly.\n\n\"There is also the matter of monastic reform, clerical education, and regulation of indulgences. These are longer-term projects. The Council has committees studying them, but nothing has reached the floor for vote.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"Your Majesty, the Castilian position has been this: support every reform that addresses genuine corruption, resist any reform designed primarily to weaken the papacy for political gain. It is... a difficult line to walk. The French see us as papal sympathizers. The papal loyalists see us as conciliarists. Cardinal Cesarini sees us as the only sane voices in the room.\"\n\nA thin smile.\n\n\"I leave it to Your Majesty to judge which assessment is correct.\"\n\nSigismund has been scanning the documents as Fray Hernando spoke. He looks up now, tapping the electoral reform decree.\n\n\"This. This is the key. If Eugenius accepts this text—passes it himself as papal legislation—it changes everything. The Council's main achievement becomes his achievement. The French lose their weapon.\"\n\nHe looks at you.\n\n\"Can you persuade him? You met with him in Rome. Does he trust you enough to accept this from your hand rather than seeing it as Basel's victory imposed on him?\""

Partnership delayed, not dead.\n\n21-40: Wants Modifications First\nAgrees in principle but insists on changes to specific provisions. Perhaps annates position too soft, or electoral reform needs carve-outs for imperial interests. Real negotiation over text required before he signs. Willing to work through the night if necessary, but won't rubber-stamp.\n\n41-60: Signs With Conditions\nWill sign joint letter but wants specific framing or additions. Perhaps stronger language on enforcement, or explicit mention of Hussite reconciliation as goal. Minor modifications, not fundamental objections. Conditional yes—partnership forming but on shared terms.\n\n61-75: Signs With Minor Reservations\nReviews documents carefully, raises one or two concerns, but fundamentally agrees. Signs the letter with perhaps small wording changes. Genuine partnership sealed. Discusses logistics—timing of delivery, who carries letters, coordination of messaging.\n\n76-90: Full Agreement\nSigismund sees exactly what he's hoped for. Signs enthusiastically after brief review. Adds his own weight to the letter with suggested phrases that strengthen it. Begins planning next steps—who to inform, how to coordinate with Basel allies. Real alliance formed.\n\n91-100: Wholehearted Partnership\nThis is the moment Sigismund has waited years for. Signs immediately, contributes his own insights to strengthen letter.

Outside, full darkness has fallen over Como, and servants have lit candles without being asked.\n\nFinally, Sigismund sets the papers down.\n\n\"The substance is good. Your delegation has done serious work.\" He looks at you. \"But I won't sign a Castilian document. I'll sign an imperial-Castilian document. There's a difference.\"\n\nHe picks up a quill, dips it, begins marking passages.\n\n\"First. The electoral reform.\" He taps the relevant section. \"This restores rights to cathedral chapters. Good. But in the German lands, the Emperor has traditional influence over certain episcopal appointments—Mainz, Cologne, Trier. The prince-electors. If this decree strips that influence entirely, I've just signed away imperial prerogatives that go back centuries.\"\n\nHe looks up at Fray Hernando.\n\n\"Can the language accommodate traditional imperial rights without gutting the reform? Something like 'respecting ancient privileges confirmed by prior councils'?\"\n\nFray Hernando considers. \"It would require careful drafting. But yes—Constance itself acknowledged certain secular privileges in elections. We could reference that precedent.\"\n\nSigismund nods, moves to the next marked passage.\n\n\"Second. Annates.\" He shakes his head. \"Your position is too soft. 'Reduce and standardize' leaves Rome room to manipulate. The German princes have been screaming about annates for decades—it's one of the few issues where I have genuine support. I want stronger language. Not abolition—that goes too far—but meaningful caps. Specific numbers. No more 'reasonable fees to be determined by Rome.'\"\n\nHe sets down the quill.\n\n\"Third. There's nothing here about the Hussites.\"\n\nThe word hangs in the air.\n\n\"I understand why. Your delegation is focused on universal reform, not Bohemian matters. But if I sign a joint declaration on Church reform and it says nothing about reconciliation with the Utraquists, my own subjects will ask why. The moderate Hussites came to Basel seeking dialogue. A reform declaration that ignores them looks like we're reforming around them rather than for them.\"\n\nHe stands, pacing.\n\n\"I'm not asking you to endorse communion in both kinds—that's a theological matter for the Council. But some language acknowledging that reform should open paths to reconciliation with those who strayed due to legitimate grievances...\" He gestures vaguely. \"Something that signals we understand why Bohemia rebelled, even if we don't endorse how.\"\n\nSigismund turns back to you.\n\n\"Make these changes, and I'll sign tonight. We draft the letter to Eugenius together—your visit, our shared commitment, the parallel legislation proposal. We draft a second letter to our allies at Basel—Cesarini, the German moderates, whoever your delegation trusts.\"\n\nHe extends his hand toward the documents.\n\n\"But I won't put my name to someone else's work and call it partnership.

Good. That's how alliances should work.\"\n\nHe gestures to Fray Hernando. \"Bring more candles. This will take time.\"\n\nAs servants add light to the darkening chamber, Sigismund begins.\n\n\"First—the prince-electors and imperial influence.\"\n\n\"The three ecclesiastical electors—Mainz, Trier, Cologne—are elected by their cathedral chapters. Legally, Rome confirms them, the chapters choose them. The Emperor has no formal role.\"\n\nHe holds up a finger.\n\n\"But formally and actually are different things. These three archbishops are also imperial princes—they hold vast territories, command armies, collect tolls. The Archbishop of Mainz is Archchancellor of Germany. He presides over imperial elections. When I need something done in the Empire, I work through Mainz.\"\n\nSigismund leans forward.\n\n\"So while I cannot appoint these archbishops, I have... influence. The cathedral chapters know that an archbishop who cannot work with the Emperor is an archbishop with problems. Families seeking these positions cultivate imperial favor. It's informal, but it's real.\"\n\nHe taps the electoral reform document.\n\n\"If this decree strips all secular influence from episcopal elections, I lose leverage I've spent decades building. I'm not asking to appoint archbishops—that would gut the reform entirely. I'm asking for language that acknowledges 'ancient privileges confirmed by prior councils.' Constance itself recognized certain traditional rights. We reference that precedent, and the reform still accomplishes its purpose while not stripping me of all influence overnight.\"\n\n\"Second—communion in both kinds.\"\n\nSigismund is quiet for a moment. When he speaks, his voice is heavier.\n\n\"Do I support it? Juan, I've spent thirty-five years trying to destroy the Hussites for demanding it. Five crusades. Tens of thousands dead. My own reputation ruined in Bohemia because I let Jan Hus burn at Constance after promising him safe conduct.\"\n\nHe stands, moves to the window.\n\n\"And now? Now I'm negotiating with Basel to grant communion in both kinds to the Bohemians. The Compactata being drafted right now—this very month—will concede exactly what five crusades failed to prevent.\"\n\nHe turns back.\n\n\"Is it theologically sound? I don't know. I'm not a theologian. The Council of Constance said Christ is entirely present in the bread alone—concomitance, they call it. So denying the cup doesn't deny Christ's blood. That's the official position.\"\n\nHis voice hardens.\n\n\"But here's what I do know. The moderate Hussites—the Utraquists—are sincere Catholics who want reconciliation with Rome. If we grant them the cup, they'll accept papal authority on everything else. They'll help us crush the Taborite radicals. They'll bring Bohemia back into the fold.\"\n\nHe returns to his seat.\n\n\"So yes, I support it—not as theology, but as policy. If communion in both kinds ends thirty-five years of war, it's a small price. The question is whether Rome will accept it as a local exception for Bohemia, or whether they'll see it as surrender to heresy.\"\n\n\"Third—annates.\"\n\nSigismund nods to Fray Hernando. \"Your friar can confirm the details, but here's how it works.\"\n\n\"When a bishop or abbot receives his office from Rome, he pays a fee—roughly half the first year's revenue. For major benefices, this goes to the papal treasury and the cardinals split it. These are called servitia communia. For minor benefices appointed by the Pope, the full payment goes to the Apostolic Camera. There are also smaller fees—servitia minuta—paid to various Curia officials.\"\n\nHe grimaces.\n\n\"The amounts are enormous. A wealthy bishopric might owe thousands of florins. The new bishop often has to borrow—from Italian bankers, usually—and spend years paying off the debt. Meanwhile, Rome keeps careful records. The Apostolic Camera knows exactly what every benefice in Christendom is worth.\"\n\nFray Hernando interjects quietly: \"The Council of Constance set a minimum threshold. Benefices worth less than twenty-four gold florins annually are exempt from annates.\"\n\nSigismund nods. \"But anything above that threshold pays. And here's the problem: Rome sets the valuations. They can assess a benefice at whatever they claim it's worth. Disputes are endless.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"The German princes have been screaming about annates for decades. It's one of the few issues where I have genuine support across factions. Your Castilian document says 'reduce and standardize.' I want specific caps. Perhaps: annates cannot exceed one-quarter of the first year's revenue, assessed by the local bishop rather than Rome. Something concrete that actually limits papal extraction.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"Give me that language, and I can tell my princes I won something real. 'Reduce and standardize' sounds like Rome will keep doing whatever it wants.\"\n\nSigismund looks between you and Fray Hernando.\n\n\"So. Three issues.

          "text": "1. Electoral reform - Juan wants clarification on how Sigismund would actually lose influence. This is a fair question. Sigismund's influence is informal, working through relationships and the fact that candidates need to work with the Emperor. The reform restores election rights to cathedral chapters - but that's already how it technically works. So what's Sigismund actually worried about losing?\n\nLooking at the research: The cathedral chapters elect the archbishop, and Rome confirms. The Emperor has traditional informal influence. The Basel decree on episcopal elections \"restores electoral rights to cathedral chapters\" - which suggests Rome had been encroaching on these elections through papal provisions and reservations (where the Pope directly appoints rather than confirming chapter elections).\n\nSo Sigismund's concern might be:\n- If the reform eliminates papal interference in elections, it also eliminates the leverage that comes from working with Rome on appointments\n- Or he's worried about specific language that might formalize things in a way that excludes secular rulers entirely\n\nActually, I think Sigismund's concern is more nuanced. Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nThe current system has papal provisions and reservations - Rome often bypasses chapter elections entirely and directly appoints. This is corrupt, but it also creates a system where Sigismund can work with Rome to influence who gets appointed. If the reform returns all power to cathedral chapters with no papal or imperial role, Sigismund loses his ability to influence through Rome.\n\nBut Juan is right - if the reform just returns elections to chapters, and Sigismund's influence is through relationships with candidates, he shouldn't lose much. The question is whether the reform language explicitly excludes secular rulers from any role.\n\n2. Communion in both kinds - Juan is supportive. Sigismund will appreciate this.\n \nJuan's proposal on annates demonstrates a strategic approach to institutional reform. By suggesting a one-quarter cap on payments and focusing on Camera restructuring instead of local bishop assessments, he's offering a more systemic solution. This approach directly challenges the corruption at Rome's core, potentially addressing Sigismund's deep-seated mistrust of papal financial mechanisms. The proposal shows nuanced political thinking - targeting the institution rather than creating a parallel assessment system that could introduce new corruption vectors.\n\nSigismund pauses, considering your question about electoral reform carefully.\n\n\"You're right to press me on this. Let me be more precise.\"\n\nHe stands, pacing as he thinks.\n\n\"The electoral system—current and proposed.\"\n\n\"Currently, cathedral chapters technically elect their bishops. But over the past century, Rome has increasingly used 'papal provisions' and 'reservations'—claiming the right to directly appoint bishops, bypassing chapters entirely. A pope might 'reserve' a see to himself before the previous bishop even dies. When it falls vacant, Rome appoints whoever they choose. The chapter's election becomes a formality, or is ignored altogether.\"\n\nHe gestures at the reform document.\n\n\"This decree ends that practice. Chapters regain genuine electoral power. No more papal provisions overriding local choice. That's good reform—I support it.\"\n\nSigismund returns to his seat, speaking more carefully now.\n\n\"My influence works through both systems. When chapters elect freely, I cultivate relationships with the canons—the men who vote. When Rome appoints directly, I negotiate with the Pope. I've used both channels for decades.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"My concern is not the substance of the reform. It's the language. If the decree says something like 'no secular prince shall interfere in episcopal elections,' that formally excludes me from even informal influence. It makes my traditional relationships look like violations of canon law.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"What I want is silence on secular rulers—neither endorsing nor forbidding our traditional relationships. The reform targets papal overreach, not imperial custom. If the language focuses on ending provisions and reservations without explicitly banning all secular involvement, I lose nothing I shouldn't lose.\"\n\nHe turns to Fray Hernando. \"Does the Castilian text address secular rulers specifically, or does it focus on papal practices?\"\n\nFray Hernando reviews the document. \"The Session Twelve decree focuses primarily on ending papal provisions and restoring chapter elections. It does not explicitly address secular princes' traditional influence, though some interpretations—\"\n\n\"Some interpretations could read it either way,\" Sigismund finishes. \"That's the problem. I want language that cannot be interpreted against imperial custom. A reference to 'respecting privileges confirmed at Constance' would accomplish that.\"\n\n\"On communion in both kinds.\"\n\nSigismund's expression softens slightly at your words.\n\n\"Character.\" He repeats the word quietly. \"Perhaps. Or perhaps just exhaustion. Thirty-five years of watching men die over whether laymen drink from the cup.\"\n\nHe's silent for a moment.\n\n\"But thank you. If Castile supports this position, it strengthens my hand at Basel. The French will oppose it—they want the Hussites crushed, not reconciled. Having a king who actually won a crusade speak for compromise...\" He nods slowly. \"That carries weight.\"\n\n\"On annates.\"\n\nSigismund listens to your counter-proposal, his expression shifting from skepticism to grudging interest.\n\n\"Reform the Apostolic Camera itself.\" He turns the idea over. \"You're right that local bishops assessing their own benefices invites a different corruption—undervaluation to curry favor, or overvaluation to harm rivals.\"\n\nHe drums his fingers on the table.\n\n\"But reforming the Camera... that's asking Rome to police itself. The Camera has been extracting money from Christendom for two centuries. Their entire purpose is maximizing papal revenue. You're proposing we tell them to... extract less, more fairly?\"\n\nFray Hernando speaks up. \"The Council has already passed provisions on Camera reform. Session Twelve addresses abuses in the collection of papal revenues. The machinery exists—the question is enforcement.\"\n\nSigismund considers this.\n\n\"Alright. One-quarter maximum—that's concrete, that's enforceable. On assessment, we don't shift authority to local bishops, but we demand transparency from the Camera. Published valuations. Right of appeal to a neutral body—perhaps the Council itself, or a standing commission. Assessments reviewed every... ten years? Twenty?\"\n\nHe looks at you.\n\n\"If we frame it as reforming the Camera rather than circumventing it, Rome might actually accept it. They keep their authority, but with oversight. The Pope can claim he's cleaning his own house rather than having it cleaned for him.\"\n\nHe picks up the quill again.\n\n\"So: one-quarter cap, Camera retains assessment authority but with mandatory transparency, published valuations, and right of appeal. Does that satisfy your concern about shifting corruption while still giving the reform teeth?\""

Their function is after all not purely their bisdom alone, they have responsibilities beyond those of a normal bishop. Qualifications in these functions naturally should improve their chances of getting elected and I think our position should reflect that.\n\n\nRegarding reform of the camera, we encounter the same problem we have everywhere. Who controls or polices the church itself?\n\n\nI think we should establish the habit or precedent that if the men that make up an institution such as the apostolic camera are not performing the tasks correctly or without corruption, the council should dismiss every member of the organization. In time, every branch will know to be more carefull about corruption since the council can dismiss them. And the council can also start investigations or committees outside of sessions to streamline this process even further. And yes, this principle would apply to everyone, including popes.

          "text": "1. For episcopal elections: Acknowledging that the prince-elector archbishop positions have dual functions (religious AND imperial) and that qualifications for these secular responsibilities should be considered in elections. This is a reasonable middle ground that preserves Sigismund's interests while supporting reform.\n\n2. For oversight/corruption: Juan is proposing that the Council should have power to dismiss entire corrupt institutions, including potentially popes. This is actually a VERY radical position that touches on the core papal-conciliar dispute.\n\nI need to think about how Sigismund would react to this:\n\n**On the electoral language:**\nThis is actually quite clever - it acknowledges the special nature of the prince-elector positions without giving the Emperor formal appointment power. Sigismund should like this.\n\n**On the Council oversight proposal:**\nThis is where it gets complicated. Juan is essentially proposing:\n- Council has dismissal authority over Church institutions\n- This includes the Pope\n- This is essentially supporting Haec Sancta in practice if not in name\n\nSigismund's position on this is complex:\n- He NEEDS Council authority to negotiate with the Hussites\n- He also NEEDS a functional papacy\n- He's been trying to mediate between the two\n- He said he believes \"the Church needs a strong pope - not a tyrant, but not a figurehead either\"\n\nSo Sigismund would have mixed feelings:\n- The institutional oversight idea might appeal to him for practical reasons\n- But explicitly saying \"including popes\" essentially endorses conciliar supremacy\n- He said earlier he won't take sides in the papal-conciliar dispute\n- This would be taking sides\n\nAlso, Juan earlier said they should \"stay away from Haec Sancta\" - now he's essentially proposing something that implies Haec Sancta's validity.\n\nSigismund should:\n1. Appreciate the electoral language - it's a good compromise\n2. Be intrigued but cautious about the institutional oversight idea\n3. Point out that \"including popes\" is basically taking a position on the authority question they said they'd sidestep\n\n4. Not reject it outright, but flag that this changes the nature of their declaration\n\nSigismund recognizes the nuanced approach. He'll carefully navigate this proposal, acknowledging its potential merits while subtly highlighting the inconsistencies. His diplomatic instincts suggest a measured response that neither fully accepts nor completely dismisses Juan's radical suggestion.\n\nThe core tension lies in Juan's apparent contradiction: previously advocating for sidestepping the Haec Sancta issue, now proposing a mechanism that fundamentally challenges papal authority. Sigismund will likely use this inconsistency to create space for negotiation and further discussion.\n\nSigismund nods slowly at your first point, genuine approval in his expression.\n\n\"On the electoral language—\"\n\n\"Yes. That's well-framed. The prince-elector archbishops are not ordinary bishops. They're imperial officers. The Archbishop of Mainz is Archchancellor of Germany—he presides over imperial elections, manages imperial correspondence, holds one of the highest offices in the Empire. Trier and Cologne hold similar functions.\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"If we state that candidates for these positions should demonstrate qualifications for both their spiritual and their imperial responsibilities, we acknowledge reality without creating new powers. The chapters still elect. Rome still confirms. But the language recognizes that a man who cannot work with the Emperor is poorly suited for a position that requires working with the Emperor.\"\n\nHe makes a note.\n\n\"Good. We can draft that tonight.\"\n\n\"On the Camera and institutional oversight—\"\n\nSigismund listens carefully to your proposal. His expression shifts—first interest, then something more cautious. He sets down his quill.\n\n\"Juan.\" His voice is measured. \"An hour ago, you said we should stay away from Haec Sancta. Sidestep the question of papal versus conciliar authority.\"\n\nHe stands, moving to the window. The night is fully dark now, Como's lights reflecting on the lake.\n\n\"Now you're proposing that the Council should have power to dismiss any Church institution—including popes. That's not sidestepping the authority question. That is the authority question.\"\n\nHe turns back to face you.\n\n\"If the Council can dismiss the Pope, the Council is superior to the Pope. That's precisely what Haec Sancta claims. That's what the French faction at Basel has been fighting for. That's what Eugenius has been fighting against for two years.\"\n\nSigismund returns to his seat, his tone not hostile but serious.\n\n\"I understand the logic. Who watches the watchmen? If no one can hold corrupt institutions accountable, corruption flourishes. That's true.\" He pauses. \"But think about what you're actually proposing.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers.\n\n\"First: You want the Pope to adopt Council reforms through parallel legislation—presenting it as his initiative, not submission to Basel. That requires him to believe the Council respects papal authority.\"\n\n\"Second: You want to include language saying the Council can dismiss any institution, including popes. The moment Eugenius reads that, he sees a trap. He'll believe we're using 'reform' as a Trojan horse to establish conciliar supremacy.\"\n\n\"Third: The French will love this language—which should concern you. Cardinal Aleman wants to depose Eugenius. If our declaration sounds like we support his position, we've just taken sides in exactly the dispute we said we'd avoid.\"\n\nSigismund spreads his hands.\n\n\"I'm not saying you're wrong about the underlying problem. The Church does need accountability mechanisms. Corrupt institutions should face consequences. But there's a difference between—\"\n\nHe pauses, searching for words.\n\n\"—between saying 'the Council may investigate and recommend reforms to correct institutional failures' and saying 'the Council may dismiss any institution including the Pope.' The first is oversight. The second is supremacy.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"So here's my question: Do you actually want to take a position on Haec Sancta? Because if you do, I need to understand that before I sign anything. My strategy has been to keep both Pope and Council functioning—not to hand either one victory over the other.\"\n\n\"Or do you want institutional accountability without explicitly establishing conciliar supremacy over the papacy? Because that's a different document—harder to write, but possible.\"\n\nHe waits, genuinely curious how you'll answer."

For this council, this is not realistic. We should focus on reforms. One of those reforms are making sure the church polices itself. In that vein, we should support an initiative for internal checks in the church. If it is a church institution, it will not have the power to depose a pope.

He's now proposing a more modest approach: internal church mechanisms for accountability, specifically focused on the Apostolic Camera, without giving the Council power over the Pope.\n\nThis is a more realistic position that Sigismund would likely appreciate - it shows Juan can listen, learn, and adjust. The proposal is now:\n\n1. Electoral reform - with language acknowledging the special imperial functions of prince-elector archbishops\n2. Communion in both kinds - supporting this for Bohemian reconciliation\n3. Annates - one-quarter cap, Camera retains assessment with transparency and appeal rights\n4. Internal church accountability mechanisms - reform of Camera with enforcement, but not Council supremacy over Pope\n\nThis is a more workable framework. Sigismund should respond positively to Juan's ability to reconsider and refine his position. This shows the kind of practical political thinking Sigismund values.\n\nLet me draft Sigismund's response - he should be pleased that Juan can adjust, and now they can move toward actually drafting the document.\n\nSigismund's tension eases visibly. He nods, something like respect in his expression.\n\n\"Good. You can adjust when you've overreached. That's rarer than you'd think in kings.\"\n\nHe returns to the table, pulling fresh parchment toward him.\n\n\"So. Internal mechanisms. The Church policing itself—but with actual teeth.\" He thinks for a moment. \"The Camera answers to the Pope. If we create an oversight body that also answers to the Pope, we've accomplished nothing. The fox guarding the henhouse.\"\n\nFray Hernando speaks carefully. \"There is precedent for mixed bodies. The Council of Constance established commissions with representatives from multiple nations and factions. They investigated specific abuses, reported findings, recommended actions. They had no power to compel—but their findings carried moral weight.\"\n\nSigismund picks up the thread. \"So we propose a standing commission—appointed jointly by Pope and Council during sessions, continuing between sessions. They audit the Camera. Investigate complaints. Publish findings.\"\n\nHe taps the table.\n\n\"No power to dismiss the Pope. No power to overrule papal decisions. But if they find corruption, they publish it. They name names. They document abuses for all Christendom to see.\"\n\nA grim smile.\n\n\"Sunlight as enforcement. Corrupt officials can't be removed by the commission, but they can be exposed. Let public shame do what legal authority cannot—at least until the Church is ready for stronger medicine.\"\n\nHe looks at you.\n\n\"For this Council, that's achievable. It establishes the principle of accountability without claiming supremacy. Future councils can strengthen the mechanism once the precedent exists.\"\n\nSigismund begins writing notes.\n\n\"So—our framework. Electoral reform with language acknowledging imperial functions. Support for communion in both kinds for Bohemian reconciliation. Annates capped at one-quarter with Camera transparency and appeal rights. And a standing oversight commission for institutional accountability.\"\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\"Can we draft tonight? I have two more days in Como. If we leave with letters ready—one to Eugenius, one to our allies at Basel—we've accomplished something real.\""

Drafting a document overnight is well within his capabilities. He'd accept the task but might note any concerns about specific language.\n\n**Sigismund:**\nThis is an interesting question about mutual commitment. Sigismund has been cautious throughout - he's been burned before by failed initiatives. On the other hand, Juan has shown he can learn, adjust, and think strategically. \n\nWhat would \"teeth\" look like? Some possibilities:\n- Joint declaration that both rulers will support these reforms\n- Commitment to coordinate pressure on Pope and Council\n- Some kind of enforcement mechanism - what if one side doesn't follow through?\n- Language about shared diplomatic efforts\n\nSigismund would be interested but careful. He'd want to know what \"working together\" actually means in practice. He's been disappointed before. He'd probably want to discuss:\n- What happens if the Pope refuses?\n- What leverage do they actually have?\n- How do they coordinate messaging?\n- What commitments are they willing to make publicly vs. privately?\n\nThis is a good moment for genuine negotiation. Sigismund should engage seriously but also probe what Juan means by \"teeth.\" The roll earlier (27) indicated he wants modifications and real negotiation - he won't just rubber stamp things.\n\nFray Hernando bows his head. \"I can have a working draft by morning, Your Majesty. The substance is clear—it's a matter of finding precise language that accomplishes our goals without triggering the concerns we've discussed.\"\n\nHe glances at the notes Sigismund has been making. \"If His Imperial Majesty permits, I would work from those notes alongside our delegation's documents. The Emperor's concerns about electoral language and annates specificity are well-taken—better to address them in the initial draft than negotiate amendments later.\"\n\nSigismund slides the notes across. \"Take them. I'll have my secretary available if you need clarification on German precedents.\"\n\nSigismund turns to your second question, his expression thoughtful.\n\n\"Teeth.\" He considers the word. \"What does that actually mean between two rulers separated by a thousand miles?\"\n\nHe stands, moving to a map hanging on the chamber wall—a rough depiction of Europe, the kind wealthy merchants keep for trade routes.\n\n\"Here is Castile.\" His finger traces the Iberian peninsula. \"Here is the Empire.\" A sweep across German lands, Bohemia, Hungary. \"Between us—France, Burgundy, the Italian states. We share no border. Our armies cannot support each other directly. If Eugenius refuses our reforms, I cannot march on Rome, and neither can you.\"\n\nHe turns back.\n\n\"So what can we do together?\"\n\nSigismund returns to the table, counting possibilities.\n\n\"First: diplomatic coordination. We speak with one voice. Letters delivered simultaneously. Ambassadors instructed to reinforce each other's positions. If the Pope hears the same message from Vienna and Toledo on the same day, he knows this isn't one king's hobby—it's a coalition.\"\n\n\"Second: economic pressure. The Church depends on revenue from our lands. If we instruct our clergy to delay annate payments pending reform... that's leverage. Not refusal—delay. 'We support the Holy Father, but our bishops require clarity on the new assessment procedures before they can calculate what they owe.' Bureaucratic obstruction in service of reform.\"\n\nA harder edge enters his voice.\n\n\"Third: the implicit threat. We don't need to say it directly, but Eugenius knows: if Pope and Council split into open schism, secular rulers choose which pope to recognize. If we signal that our support for him depends on reform, he understands the alternative. We don't threaten—we simply remind him that unity requires compromise from everyone.\"\n\nHe sits back.\n\n\"Fourth: Basel itself. Your delegation remains there. I'll return there within weeks. If we coordinate with the German moderates, Cardinal Cesarini, whatever reasonable Italians remain—we build a reform faction that neither French radicals nor papal hardliners can ignore. Weight of numbers.\"\n\nSigismund looks at you directly.\n\n\"Should we include language about commitment? Yes—but carefully. Something like: 'We pledge to coordinate our efforts in support of these reforms, to encourage their adoption by all Christian princes, and to work toward Church unity through genuine reform rather than factional victory.'\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"What we don't say publicly is the harder question. Are we willing to recognize a Council-elected pope if Eugenius refuses reform entirely and Basel deposes him? Are we willing to withhold recognition from Eugenius if he tries to dissolve Basel again?\"\n\nHis eyes are sharp.\n\n\"Those are the real teeth, Juan. The ultimate leverage. I'm not asking you to answer tonight—but you should think about where your limits are. How far are you willing to go if the Pope chooses confrontation over compromise?\""

Sigismund needs to decide if he agrees with this stronger tone.

He might want to ensure it's firm but not threatening, strong but not ultimatum-like. He's a skilled diplomat despite his frustrations.\n\nThis doesn't need a roll - it's a question of tone on something they've already agreed to in substance. Sigismund has been moving toward this position throughout the conversation.\n\nSigismund is quiet for a moment. The candles flicker. Outside, Como sleeps.\n\nThen he nods slowly.\n\n\"You're right. A petition from Emperor and King—from men who command between us half of Christendom's military strength—would look like uncertainty. Like we're asking permission rather than stating necessity.\"\n\nHe stands, moving to the window one final time. When he speaks, his voice is heavier.\n\n\"I've spent two years trying to mediate. Gentle letters. Careful diplomacy. 'Holy Father, perhaps you might consider...' 'Venerable Council fathers, if it please you to examine...'\" He shakes his head. \"And what has it accomplished? Nothing. They're still at each other's throats. Still more concerned with winning than with the Church surviving.\"\n\nHe turns back, and there's iron in his expression now.\n\n\"You completed a crusade while I wrote letters. Perhaps it's time I remembered that emperors are supposed to lead, not beg.\"\n\nSigismund returns to the table and sits heavily.\n\n\"Statement of position. We support these reforms. We expect the Church to adopt them. We commit to working together to see them implemented. And we make clear—without explicit threat, but unmistakably—that Christian unity depends on genuine reform, not factional victory.\"\n\nHe looks at Fray Hernando.\n\n\"Frame it as duty, not demand. We speak not as adversaries of the Holy Father, but as Christian rulers who cannot watch the Church tear itself apart. Our position is firm because the alternative is unthinkable—not because we seek to diminish papal authority.\"\n\nFray Hernando nods, making notes. \"Firm in substance, respectful in form. The strength comes from the signatures and the coordination, not from aggressive language.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" Sigismund turns to you. \"We stand together because we must, not because we wish to threaten. Let Eugenius understand that this is not politics—this is survival. His and ours.\"\n\nHe extends his hand across the table.\n\n\"Then we are agreed, Juan of Castile. Draft tonight. Review tomorrow. Sign before you leave Como.\"\n\nA pause. Something shifts in his weathered face—not quite warmth, but perhaps the beginning of it.\n\n\"I have waited a long time to find a king who understands what's actually at stake. Who acts instead of talks. Who listens when he's wrong and adjusts.\" He clasps your hand firmly. \"Perhaps God has not abandoned the cause of Christian unity entirely.\"\n\nHe releases your hand and gestures to Fray Hernando.\n\n\"Go. Write. We'll reconvene at first light.\"\n\nFray Hernando gathers the documents and bows to both of you. At the door, he pauses.\n\n\"Your Majesties. This declaration—if it works—may be remembered for generations. If it fails...\" He doesn't finish the sentence. \"I will write carefully.\"\n\nHe departs. The chamber falls quiet.\n\nSigismund pours two cups of wine and slides one to you.\n\n\"Now. While your friar writes, tell me about Constantinople. You've committed a thousand knights and sixty thousand florins. I received Emperor John's appeals years ago—sent what I could spare, which wasn't much.\" He drinks. \"What's your actual plan? Defend the walls until the Ottomans lose interest? Buy time for a broader crusade? Or something more ambitious?\""

          "text": "Juan is explaining his realistic assessment of the Constantinople situation to Sigismund. He's being honest about the limitations of his aid - it buys time but isn't enough to actually defeat the Ottomans. He's also mentioned offering the Byzantines sanctuary in Castile as an alternative.\n\nSigismund has direct experience with the Ottoman threat through Hungary. He's been dealing with this for decades. He should have strong opinions and knowledge about this.\n\nLet me think about what Sigismund would say:\n1. He would appreciate Juan's realism - not another grand crusade plan that will fall apart\n2. He has direct experience fighting Ottomans on Hungary's borders\n3. He knows what a real anti-Ottoman campaign would require\n4. He might share his own assessment of what's actually possible\n5. He might discuss János Hunyadi - his best commander against the Ottomans\n6. He would probably be interested in Juan's offer of sanctuary - that's an unusual and pragmatic option\n\nThe conversation should flow naturally. Sigismund is tired, it's late, they've just finished intense negotiations. This is a more personal moment - two rulers sharing their burdens over wine.\n\nI should have Sigismund respond thoughtfully, perhaps sharing his own experience and assessment. He shouldn't be too easy or too agreeable - he's a realist who has been fighting the Ottomans indirectly through Hungary for years.\n\nSigismund drinks slowly, considering your words. The late hour and the wine have softened something in him—this is no longer negotiation, but two tired rulers talking honestly.\n\n\"Sanctuary in Castile.\" He turns the idea over. \"That's... not what I expected. Most kings who talk about Constantinople imagine themselves riding through the Golden Gate as liberators. You're offering them an escape route.\"\n\nHe sets down his cup.\n\n\"It's realistic. I'll grant you that. More realistic than anything I've heard from Rome or Basel.\" A pause. \"But you're right—they won't take it. Not yet. Perhaps not ever.\"\n\nSigismund stares into his wine.\n\n\"I've dealt with the Palaiologoi for decades. Proud beyond reason. They still call themselves Basileus Rhomaion—Emperor of the Romans. They believe Constantinople is the center of the world, the Second Rome, the city God himself protects. Their empire has been dying for two hundred years, and still they believe God will save them at the last moment.\"\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\"They'll fight. They'll die on those walls rather than abandon them. It's who they are. The only way they leave Constantinople is if Constantinople ceases to exist—and by then, there won't be many left to resettle anywhere.\"\n\nA heavy silence.\n\n\"As for actually defeating the Ottomans...\" Sigismund shakes his head. \"I have one commander who understands how to fight them. János Hunyadi. Transylvanian. Brilliant tactician. He's won victories no one thought possible—small ones, but real. He knows their methods, their weaknesses.\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"Hunyadi tells me the same thing you just said. It requires a massive effort. Unified command. Thirty-five, forty thousand professional soldiers—not feudal levies who go home after one season. Supply lines through Hungary. Years of sustained campaign, not one glorious charge.\"\n\nSigismund laughs bitterly.\n\n\"Do you know what I told him? 'János, I can't get the German princes to agree on anything for more than six months. I can't get the Pope and Council to stop fighting each other long enough to declare a crusade. Where am I supposed to find forty thousand men and the gold to feed them for years?'\"\n\nHe refills both cups.\n\n\"So. Your thousand knights buy time. Your florins repair walls. And then?\" He gestures vaguely eastward. \"The Sultan masses his forces. The walls hold for a year, maybe two, maybe five if God is merciful. And then one day they don't hold. And Constantinople falls. And the Ottomans stand at Hungary's doorstep with nothing between them and Vienna.\"\n\nHe drinks deeply.\n\n\"That's the future I see, Juan. Unless something changes. Unless someone actually unites Christendom—not in words, but in action. Pope and Council. Emperor and kings. Hungary and Poland and Venice and Genoa and Castile and Aragon and whoever else can be dragged into it.\"\n\nHis eyes meet yours.\n\n\"You've done something I couldn't do. You united Castile, finished the Reconquista, built an alliance stretching to Naples. You made the impossible happen once.\"\n\nHe sets down his cup.\n\n\"Can you do it again? Can anyone?\""

I can command my navy to go toe to toe with theirs, and my armies do not fear them. I do not fear them. If they are truly ready for the fight for their culture, their city and their empire, then so will I be ready to come to their aid and I will speak with you again. We will need to unite as christians and drive Islam from the eastern side of the european continent. I have done it already in the west, now we should do the same in the east.\n\n\nBut I will first have to speak with them. I will keep you updated sir. This concerns us both."

Confidence - doesn't fear the Ottomans\n3. Experience - has already completed Reconquista\n4. Strategic thinking - knows this requires Christian unity\n5. Respect for Sigismund - keeping him updated, acknowledging shared concern\n\nThis is the kind of king Sigismund has been waiting for. Someone who actually acts, who has proven himself, who thinks strategically, and who is realistic about what can and cannot be achieved.\n\nI should write Sigismund's response as genuine respect and perhaps the beginning of a real partnership. Not overly warm - he's a cynical old man - but genuinely moved by finding someone who thinks and acts the way he wishes more rulers did.\n\nThe scene should probably wind down naturally after this - it's late, Fray Hernando is drafting, they've covered a lot of ground. Maybe end with Sigismund offering some final thought or commitment, setting up the next day's work.\n\nSigismund is silent for a long moment. The candles have burned low. Somewhere in the palace, a clock chimes the late hour.\n\nWhen he speaks, his voice is quieter than before.\n\n\"'I will not bleed my men for those who will not save themselves.'\" He repeats your words slowly. \"That's... that's what I should have said thirty-five years ago. About Bohemia. About a dozen other hopeless causes I threw men into because honor demanded it, or pride, or stubbornness.\"\n\nHe looks at you with something new in his expression. Not warmth exactly—Sigismund is too old and too scarred for easy warmth—but recognition. The look of a man who has finally found someone who speaks his language.\n\n\"You've already done it in the west. Sixty years of my life, Juan—sixty years—and I've never seen a Christian king actually finish what he started. They talk about crusades. They raise armies. They march out with banners flying. And then... winter comes, or the treasury empties, or they quarrel with their allies, or they simply lose interest. The crusade dissolves. Nothing changes.\"\n\nHe stands, moving stiffly—the hour and the wine and the years all weighing on him.\n\n\"You didn't just talk. You conquered Granada. You ended the Reconquista. Eight hundred years of war, and you finished it.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"And now you sit here telling me you'll do the same in the East—if Constantinople wants to be saved.\"\n\nSigismund moves to the door, then pauses, his hand on the frame.\n\n\"Keep me informed. When you've spoken with Emperor John, when you know whether they'll fight or merely die with dignity—write to me. If there's a real chance, if Constantinople chooses to live rather than simply to fall gloriously...\"\n\nHe turns back.\n\n\"Then you'll have Hungary at your side. What's left of my strength, whatever years I have remaining. Hunyadi and his tactics. The weight of the imperial title, for whatever that's worth anymore.\"\n\nA ghost of a smile crosses his weathered face.\n\n\"I'm sixty-five years old, Juan. I've failed at almost everything I've attempted. Bohemia. The Church. Holding the Empire together. But perhaps...\" He pauses. \"Perhaps God has kept me alive this long to see one thing through. To find one ally who actually means what he says.\"\n\nHe straightens, some of the imperial dignity returning.\n\n\"We sign tomorrow. Then you ride to your wife, and I ride to Basel. And after that—Constantinople, Rome, whatever comes next.\"\n\nSigismund opens the door.\n\n\"Sleep if you can. Fray Hernando will have the draft by morning. And Juan—\"\n\nHe looks back one final time.\n\n\"Thank you. For riding three days through the Alps to meet an old man on the road. For listening. For being honest about what you can and cannot do.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"I think perhaps we understand each other.\"\n\nHe departs, his footsteps fading down the corridor.\n\nThe chamber falls silent. Through the window, the first hint of gray touches the eastern sky over the lake. Somewhere below, you can hear Fray Hernando's voice, quietly dictating to a scribe.\n\nWhat do you do?"
