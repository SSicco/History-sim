The speech invokes the military victories at Alcala la Real and Malaga and announces Isabel's pregnancy. The reception is cold (d100 roll 33): most nobles sit in uneasy silence calculating the financial burden, Don Pedro de Velasco raises concerns about the vague duration, and Don Garcia de Mendoza protests the steep increase. The resistant houses' representatives (Niebla, Medina, Sotomayor) take satisfaction in the tepid response.",

Let me search for more information about the current status, particularly about the character tracker and any other relevant context.\n\nKey points from Chapter 27:\n- Juan has just arrived at Valladolid on November 14, 1431\n- Cortes convenes November 15 (tomorrow in the story)\n- Juan plans to:\n  1. Open Cortes and present 8% crusade tax law with levy compensation\n  2. Let nobles debate for 2-3 days\n  3. After tax law passes, announce three excommunications (Niebla, Medina, Sotomayor)\n  4. Present the three Crown Marshals (Íñigo López de Orozco, García Fernández de Villalobos, Pedro Álvarez de Osorio)\n  5. End with eternal crusade vision about Africa\n\n- About 60 nobles present\n- Atmosphere is tense - supporters and opposition both present\n- Three Crown Marshals are with him, having spent days in Toledo learning their role\n- Isabel is 7-8 months pregnant, remaining in Toledo\n\nLet me check the character tracker for current status of key figures.\n\nThe character tracker is outdated (last updated at end of Chapter 18, mid-April 1431), but Chapter 27 provides comprehensive current information. I now have enough context.\n\nCurrent situation (from Chapter 27):\n- Date: November 14, 1431, evening - Juan has just arrived in Valladolid\n- Cortes convenes tomorrow, November 15\n- About 60 nobles present - supporters and opposition\n- Juan plans to open Cortes and present 8% crusade tax law\n- Three Crown Marshals are with him: Íñigo López de Orozco, García Fernández de Villalobos, Pedro Álvarez de Osorio\n- Isabel is 7-8 months pregnant, remaining in Toledo with Dona Beatriz\n- Álvaro de Luna is with Juan as Royal Constable\n\nThe user wants to start Chapter 28 by opening the Cortes. Following the RPG instructions:\n- I should NOT write Juan's dialogue or actions\n- I should set the scene, describe the atmosphere and NPCs\n- I should STOP after presenting the situation and wait for the player to provide Juan's opening speech\n- Keep it SHORT (2-4 paragraphs) since this is an active scene\n- Present the situation and wait for player input\n\nLet me write a short scene-setting response that describes the Cortes hall, the assembled nobles, and stops just before Juan needs to speak.\n\nChapter 28: The Opening of the Cortes\n\nDate: November 15, 1431, Morning\nLocation: Great Hall of Valladolid Palace\n\nThe Great Hall fills with noise—sixty nobles taking their seats on wooden benches arranged in a horseshoe, their retainers lining the walls behind them. Banners hang from the rafters displaying the arms of Castile's great houses: the Mendozas' crimson lions, the Enríquez crosses, the Toledo stars. Morning light streams through high windows, illuminating dust motes that dance above the assembly.\n\nÁlvaro stands at your right hand, the Royal Constable's staff held firmly. Behind you, three men in distinctive black cloaks wait in the shadows—Íñigo López de Orozco, García Fernández de Villalobos, and Pedro Álvarez de Osorio. The black oak staffs topped with gilded crowns rest against the wall, not yet revealed. Archbishop Gutiérrez Álvarez de Toledo sits in the place of honor, while Cardinal Capranica occupies the papal observer's seat, his red robes a splash of color against the stone.\n\nThe conversations die away as you step forward to the dais. Every eye fixes on you—the white-armored king, nineteen years old, fresh from crushing Sultan Muhammad's army. Some faces show open admiration: Don Íñigo López de Mendoza the Elder, the loyal houses who served well in the crusade. Others are carefully neutral: representatives of the three houses whose masters threatened your assessors. Still others watch with barely concealed hostility.\n\nThe herald strikes his staff three times against the floor. \"His Majesty Juan II, by the grace of God King of Castile and León, Supreme Commander of the Granada Crusade, calls this Cortes to order!\"\n\nSilence falls. The assembly waits."

          "text": "Fellow knights of Castille, I greet you.\n\n\nWhen we met last year in Seville, we were about to start our crusade against Grenada. Now, after one year of campaining, we can look back on a successful campain. We crushed the Sultan's army at Alcala la Real. We have taken many forts and when I confronted the Sultan at the gates of his own city, the infidel showed their dishonourable nature and attacked us. God was again on our side and we preservered.\n\n\nAfter we have taken Malaga, Ronda and almost the entire coastline, it must be clear even to the most fervent infidel that victory is more within our grasp than ever. The reconquista almost complete!\n\n\nBut many have indicated to me and to my court that keeping so many men in the field is expensive and I have assembled you here to adress this issue.\n\n\nI reach for the drafted Crusade tax law, a scroll that is laying on the table.\n\n\nThis law will reant compensation for troops in the field. A mounted men at arms for example will yield his lord 80 maravedis per month, with knights earning more and foot soldiers earning less. I trust you find these compensations more than fair.\n\n\nThis law will also increase the crusade tax to 8%, but will eliminate the regular crown tax. This will mean that a noble supplying many soldiers to the crusade may actually earn some money instead of paying. A just compensation for his contribution. Those nobles who maybe have less men at arms available contribute through taxation.\n\n\nKnights of Castille, these taxes are temporary, lasting only until the crusade in complete. Even so, I recognize that this new tax represents a major reform in the manner Castillian nobles fulfill their noble obligations. Castille owes it's existance to to nobles willing to take up arms to defend christianity and I therefore bring this new tax before the Cortes so we may together determine the best way for this kingdom to complete the reconquista.\n\n\nIn other news, I can happily say that our queen, Isabel of Portugal is heavy with child and I expect to start the coming campain season as a father. I have also worked with the vatican to better streamline the way we collect taxes fairly. And finally, I want to use this Cortes to look ahead at after the crusade. How and who will rule the new lands, and what other holy purpose will guide us going forward.\n\n\nBut first, I want to discuss the law with the Cortes. I imagine you may have questions.\n\n\nTHe above is part of an action that we will roll for later. I have just given a speech but we do not yet know how effective this will be.\n\n\nDraft a d100 table with possible reactions from the Cortes after the above opening speech."

          "text": "PROS (factors favoring positive reception):\n- Military victories are undeniable and impressive\n- Compensation rates are genuinely generous (80 maravedís/month for men-at-arms is good)\n- Math works out where nobles supplying troops might actually profit\n- Eliminates regular crown tax (saves money for some)\n- He's bringing it to Cortes for discussion (shows respect)\n- Papal backing and legitimacy\n- The \"temporary until crusade ends\" framing\n- His personal prestige after victories\n- Isabel's pregnancy is good news (continuity)\n- The speech acknowledges this is a major change and respects their role\n\nCONS (factors against positive reception):\n- 8% is much higher than 5%\n- Some nobles don't have many troops to supply (so they just pay more)\n- \"Temporary\" could last years\n- The wealthiest houses (who resisted assessment) will pay most\n- Creates permanent precedent for royal taxation\n- Some nobles already financially strained from 8 months of campaign\n- Those who resisted assessment fear this empowers the system\n- Hints at future plans might worry those who want things to return to normal\n\n- The three houses whose representatives threatened assessors are present and nervous\n\nI'll consider the political tension carefully. The three houses with threatened representatives add significant complexity to the potential reaction. Their nervousness could push the response toward more extreme outcomes, potentially increasing the chance of strong opposition or dramatic confrontation.\n\nThe tax proposal seems risky - a substantial 60% increase with pre-existing noble hostility suggests a delicate negotiation. While the speech appears strategic, the high tax rate means I'll need to weight potential outcomes toward cautious success, acknowledging a meaningful risk of rejection.\n\nEvaluation of Your Opening Speech\n\nFACTORS IN FAVOR (Pros):\n\nMilitary credibility: Undeniable victories at Alcalá la Real, Málaga, coastal conquests - you're speaking from position of triumph\n\nGenerous compensation: 80 maravedís/month for men-at-arms is genuinely fair; nobles who supply troops could actually profit\n\nTax elimination: Removing regular crown tax offsets the crusade tax increase for many\n\nRespectful framing: Bringing it to Cortes shows respect for their role, even though papal bull gives you authority\n\nTemporary duration: \"Until crusade complete\" makes it less threatening than permanent reform\n\nPersonal connection: Isabel's pregnancy creates goodwill and continuity\n\nPapal legitimacy: Vatican backing and improved collection mentioned\n\nHistorical appeal: Invokes noble warrior tradition and Reconquista completion\n\nClear explanation: Math is straightforward - those who serve might profit, others pay tax\n\nFuture vision: Hints at post-crusade plans gives them something to look forward to\n\nFACTORS AGAINST (Cons):\n\n60% tax increase: From 5% to 8% is substantial jump\n\nFinancial strain: Many nobles already depleted from 8-month campaign season\n\nUnequal impact: Nobles without large retinues just pay more with no compensation benefit\n\n\"Temporary\" concerns: Could last years; creates precedent for future royal taxation\n\nResistant houses present: Representatives of Niebla, Medina, Sotomayor sitting in hall, already hostile\n\nAssessment fears: Those who resisted assessment fear this empowers the system they opposed\n\nAmbiguous ending: \"Until crusade complete\" definition unclear - when exactly?\n\nPost-crusade hints: Some want return to normal, not \"other holy purposes\"\n\nTiming: Asking for more money right after expensive campaign season\n\nGreat house burden: Wealthiest estates (who have most to lose) will pay the most\n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT: Strong speech with genuine benefits for those who contribute troops, but asking for significant financial commitment from an already-strained nobility. The respectful framing and military credibility help considerably, but opposition from resistant houses and financially exhausted nobles is likely.\n\nD100 Reaction Table: Cortes Response to Opening Speech\n\n1-5: CATASTROPHIC FAILURE - Open Revolt\nMultiple great houses stand simultaneously in outrage. \"This is tyranny disguised as crusade!\" Accusations that you're using papal authority to destroy noble independence. Representatives of resistant houses lead walkout, threatening to withdraw support entirely. Some shout about summoning their retinues. Chaos in the hall. Your authority directly challenged. The Cortes might collapse before debate even begins.\n\n6-15: SERIOUS FAILURE - Unified Opposition\nStrong, coordinated resistance from 40-50% of nobles present. The resistant houses' representatives speak eloquently about taxation without true consent, financial exhaustion, and royal overreach. They argue the compensation doesn't offset the burden and that \"temporary\" is meaningless. Motion made to reject the law entirely. Moderate nobles waver. You're facing potential defeat of the proposal.\n\n16-30: FAILURE - Hostile Reception\nClear majority skeptical or opposed. Many nobles visibly angry about 8% rate. Questions shouted before formal debate: \"How long is 'temporary'?\" \"What about nobles with few troops?\" \"This is confiscation!\" The resistant houses find unexpected allies among exhausted middling nobility. Archbishop Gutiérrez looks concerned. You'll need to make major concessions to salvage anything.\n\n31-45: MIXED/POOR - Cold Reception\nPolite but unenthusiastic response. Scattered applause dies quickly. Most faces show concern rather than support. The compensation rates interest some, but 8% increase troubles many. Nobles begin calculating quietly - many realize they'll pay more. Questions about definition of \"crusade complete\" and whether this sets permanent precedent. Debate will be contentious. Outcome genuinely uncertain.\n\n46-60: MIXED/NEUTRAL - Divided Response\nHall splits visibly. Don Íñigo the Elder and loyal houses nod approvingly, but many others look troubled. Some nobles clearly see benefit (those with large retinues), others see only burden. Murmuring - not hostile but not supportive. Representatives of resistant houses sit stone-faced. Moderate nobles calculating whether compensation offsets tax. Will require significant debate and possibly modifications. Could go either way.\n\n61-75: SUCCESS - Cautious Acceptance\nRespectful attention throughout. Moderate applause when you finish. Don Íñigo the Elder stands: \"The compensation is fair for those who serve!\" Others nod. Questions are serious but not hostile: clarifications about payment schedules, troop qualification standards, exact ending conditions. The resistant houses' representatives object, but they're clearly minority. Nobles who served in crusade speak supportively. Strong chance of passage with minor modifications.\n\n76-85: GOOD SUCCESS - Positive Reception\nSolid applause. Many nobles nodding, especially those who supplied troops. \"Fair compensation!\" someone calls out. Don Íñigo the Elder: \"His Majesty honors those who fight!\" Others stand to voice support. Even some neutral nobles look pleased - the math works for them. Questions are constructive rather than hostile. The resistant houses' representatives isolated. Isabel's pregnancy news generates genuine warmth. High probability of passage without major changes.\n\n86-95: GREAT SUCCESS - Enthusiastic Support\nStrong applause breaks out. Multiple nobles stand immediately in support. \"Justice for those who serve!\" Don Íñigo: \"WELL SPOKEN, YOUR MAJESTY!\" Others echo support. Nobles begin calculating loudly that they'll actually profit from supplying troops. \"Finally, warriors rewarded properly!\" The compensation structure impresses even skeptics. Representatives of resistant houses sit silent and isolated. Moderate nobles who were neutral now lean supportive. The 8% concerns overshadowed by compensation benefits. Near-certain passage.\n\n96-100: EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS - Overwhelming Acclaim\nThe hall erupts in applause. Nobles rise to their feet. \"The King honors warriors!\" someone shouts. Don Íñigo: \"This is how a crusade should be financed!\" Even traditionally cautious nobles call out support. The compensation structure praised as brilliant - finally recognizing military contribution properly. \"Those who fight are rewarded, those who don't contribute fairly!\" Multiple nobles volunteer to speak in favor during debate. The resistant houses' representatives look shocked at isolation. Isabel's pregnancy generates cheers. Some nobles call to vote immediately without debate. This becomes a triumph that strengthens your authority significantly. The tax law will pass easily, and you've gained major political capital.\n\nReady when you are. Roll your d100 and report the result."

For a moment, silence hangs in the Great Hall.\n\nThen scattered applause begins—Don Íñigo the Elder clapping enthusiastically, joined by a dozen loyal houses who served in the crusade. But the sound dies quickly, swallowed by the vast stone chamber. Most of the assembly sits motionless, faces carefully neutral or openly troubled.\n\nA nobleman near the back—one of the middling houses—leans to his neighbor and begins counting on his fingers, lips moving silently. Others do the same throughout the hall. You can almost hear the calculations: Eight percent of my estates... minus what I'd save from eliminated crown tax... but I only have forty men-at-arms, not enough to profit from the compensation...\n\nNear the front, a portly count shakes his head slowly. Beside him, a younger noble's face has gone pale—clearly realizing the mathematics don't favor him.\n\nThe representative of the Count of Niebla—a thin man with a sharp face—sits with arms crossed, the hint of a smile playing at his lips. He whispers something to the Baron de Medina's representative, who nods grimly. They see opportunity in this tepid response.\n\nDon Íñigo the Elder rises, perhaps sensing the need to break the uncomfortable silence. \"Your Majesty speaks wisdom! Those who fight should be—\"\n\nBut he's interrupted by a voice from the middle benches. An older nobleman stands, his expression respectful but firm. \"Your Majesty, if I may?\" It's Don Pedro de Velasco, an influential figure among the middling nobility—neither a great house nor a minor knight. \"The compensation structure is... interesting. But many of us have questions.\"\n\nBehind him, at least twenty nobles nod in agreement. The resistant houses' representatives lean forward, watching intently.\n\nDon Pedro continues: \"When you say 'until the crusade is complete'—what precisely does that mean? When Granada city falls? When every village submits? When the Sultan converts?\" He pauses. \"Some crusades have lasted decades, Your Majesty. We need clarity.\"\n\nMurmurs of agreement ripple through the hall. Another noble stands—Don García de Mendoza, a lesser branch of that house. \"And Your Majesty, with respect—eight percent is a significant increase from five. For those of us with modest retinues...\" He trails off meaningfully.\n\nÁlvaro shifts beside you, hand tightening slightly on his staff. Cardinal Capranica watches impassively, but Archbishop Gutiérrez looks concerned.\n\nMore hands begin to rise. The hall fills with the rustle of nobles preparing to speak, the mood anxious rather than hostile—but far from supportive.\n\nDon Pedro still stands, awaiting your response. The Cortes has turned its attention fully to you, expecting answers to legitimate concerns."

Don Pedro de Velasco notes that larger houses profit handsomely while smaller ones lose, laying bare the structural inequality in the compensation formula.",

When will this crusade end? \nFortunately, the crusade bull is very clear on this. As you know, I have been campaining through the year and I will not stop until we have taken Grenada and have fulfilled the command given to us by the holy pope. This is also clearly defined in the law itself.\n\n\nAnd I pose this question to the Cortes. Is 8% really too much? It is still less than the ancient tithe at 10% and with the compensation mechanism, I truly believe these taxes to be more than fair. It may advantage some more than others, true, but those may ask themselves why that is. This kingdom became strong because we took up the sword against Islam and I intend to reward those who do. Not only with the monetary compensation this law provides, but also with land and title in Grenada as well once we have won.\n\n\nDoes this Cortes not recognize the advantages of this new opportunity?\n\n\nDraft a d100 table to determine the Cortes response to my arguments."

          "text": "**PROS:**\n- Clear answer on duration (Granada city falls = end)\n- Tithe comparison makes 8% sound reasonable\n- Land/title promises in Granada are attractive\n- Appeals to warrior honor and tradition\n- Directly addresses the concerns raised\n- Shows confidence and control\n- Promise of concrete rewards beyond just money\n- Implies criticism of those who don't fight without directly insulting them\n\n**CONS:**\n- The \"ask themselves why\" line could be seen as insulting to nobles without large retinues\n- Some nobles can't field large armies due to estate size, not lack of courage\n- Land/title promises compete with existing Granada distribution expectations\n- Duration still somewhat vague - \"Granada\" could mean city or whole kingdom\n- Tithe comparison might annoy church\n- Doesn't address financial exhaustion from 8-month campaign\n- Somewhat confrontational tone - \"Does this Cortes not recognize...\"\n- The implication that non-warriors are less worthy could alienate support\n\nThis is a decent recovery attempt but has some risks. The Granada land promises are smart - that's a strong incentive. But the slightly accusatory tone about \"why don't you benefit from compensation\" could backfire.\n\nI should make the table reflect that this helps somewhat but doesn't fully solve the concerns. He's clarified some things and added incentives, but the fundamental financial burden remains and he's been a bit pointed in his implications.\n\nEvaluation of Your Follow-Up Arguments\n\nADDITIONAL FACTORS IN FAVOR:\n\nClear endpoint definition: \"When Granada falls\" is concrete answer to major concern\n\nTithe comparison: 8% sounds reasonable compared to Church's 10%\n\nLand/title promises: Granada estates are powerful incentive for warrior houses\n\nAppeals to tradition: Invokes Castile's martial heritage effectively\n\nConfidence: Taking control shows authority and decisiveness\n\nDirect address: Answering concerns immediately shows you're listening\n\nDual rewards: Both monetary compensation AND future land grants\n\nPapal backing: \"Command given by holy pope\" reinforces legitimacy\n\nADDITIONAL FACTORS AGAINST:\n\nImplied insult: \"Ask themselves why that is\" suggests nobles without troops are cowards or weak\n\nStructural inequality: Some nobles genuinely can't field large retinues due to estate size\n\nFinancial reality ignored: Doesn't address that many are already financially exhausted\n\nConfrontational tone: \"Does this Cortes not recognize...\" sounds accusatory\n\nGranada competition: Land promises might conflict with existing expectations from great houses\n\n\"Granada\" still vague: City? Kingdom? Every village? Not fully clarified\n\nChurch comparison risk: Mentioning tithe might bother ecclesiastical observers\n\nDivides the nobility: Creates \"warriors vs non-warriors\" split that could breed resentment\n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT: Stronger recovery attempt that addresses key concerns and adds attractive incentives, but the slightly accusatory tone risks alienating middling nobles who can't field large armies. The Granada land promises help significantly with ambitious houses.\n\nD100 Table: Cortes Response to Follow-Up Arguments\n\n1-5: MAKES IT WORSE - Outrage at Implication\nDon García de Mendoza rises, face flushed: \"Your Majesty implies we are cowards? I have forty men because my estates support forty, not because I lack courage!\" Multiple nobles shout agreement. \"Not all of us command thousands!\" The accusatory tone has backfired catastrophically. Nobles who were neutral now lean hostile. Even some loyal houses look uncomfortable. You've insulted men who can't afford large retinues through no fault of their own.\n\n6-12: SERIOUS FAILURE - Deepens Opposition\nThe \"ask themselves why\" comment lands poorly. Murmurs of discontent spread. \"Easy for great houses to profit,\" someone mutters. Don Pedro de Velasco: \"Your Majesty, some serve faithfully with what they have. This law favors the already powerful.\" Many nobles nod—you've highlighted rather than solved the inequality problem. The resistant houses' representatives smile. Even Archbishop Gutiérrez winces at the tone.\n\n13-25: FAILURE - Concerns Not Addressed\nYour arguments don't sway the skeptics. \"Still doesn't explain how we pay 8% after eight months in the field,\" a voice calls. Another: \"Granada could take years to fully conquer!\" The tithe comparison dismissed—\"We already pay tithes, this is ON TOP.\" Land promises interest warriors but alarm others: \"Who decides distribution?\" The fundamental financial burden remains. Hostile questions multiply.\n\n26-40: POOR - Minimal Movement\nA few nobles nod at the Granada land promises—that's attractive. But most remain unconvinced. Don Pedro: \"Your Majesty clarifies the duration, but that could still be years.\" The compensation explanation doesn't satisfy those without large retinues. Some take offense at the implication they should \"ask themselves why.\" The hall remains divided and tense, perhaps slightly worse than before due to the confrontational edge.\n\n41-55: MIXED - Partial Recovery\nThe Granada land promises generate real interest—several ambitious nobles lean forward. \"Estates in Granada?\" someone asks. The endpoint clarification helps somewhat. But the \"ask themselves why\" line causes uncomfortable shifting. Don Íñigo the Elder tries to help: \"His Majesty rewards those who take up the sword!\" Mixed reactions. Some convinced, many still troubled. You've stopped the slide but haven't won them over.\n\n56-70: MODEST SUCCESS - Slight Improvement\nThe arguments register. Several nobles nod at the tithe comparison—8% does sound more reasonable framed that way. Granada land promises spark visible excitement among warrior houses. \"Estates in the south!\" The duration clarification satisfies some concerns. But the inequality issue remains for smaller houses. Don Pedro sits down, not fully satisfied but no longer openly challenging. Atmosphere slightly warmer, but still uncertain.\n\n71-82: SUCCESS - Clear Improvement\nYour confidence and clear answers shift the mood. The Granada land promises work brilliantly—multiple nobles sit straighter, calculating potential. \"Those who fight will be rewarded with estates!\" someone says approvingly. The tithe comparison makes 8% seem reasonable. Duration concerns largely addressed. Even some skeptics nod. The \"ask themselves why\" line is forgiven as passionate rather than insulting. Don Íñigo: \"The King speaks truth!\" The resistant houses look concerned—support is building.\n\n83-92: GOOD SUCCESS - Strong Recovery\nThe hall's energy changes. Granada land promises ignite ambition—nobles imagining southern estates. \"This is opportunity!\" The tithe comparison lands well—heads nodding throughout. Your confident tone reassures rather than offends. Don Pedro de Velasco stands again: \"His Majesty makes fair points. The compensation IS generous for those who serve.\" Others agree. Even smaller houses see the appeal—if they can't profit from compensation, perhaps sons could win estates in battle. Momentum shifting your direction.\n\n93-97: GREAT SUCCESS - Decisive Shift\nThe Granada vision catches fire. \"Estates in conquered territory!\" Multiple nobles rise: \"This is what Castile was built on!\" The warrior tradition appeal resonates powerfully. Your directness seen as kingly strength. Don Íñigo: \"Those who take up the sword will be rewarded—as it should be!\" Even cautious nobles warm to the vision. The math still troubles some, but the promise of land and glory overrides concerns. The resistant houses sit isolated. Clear path to passage emerging.\n\n98-100: OVERWHELMING SUCCESS - Complete Turnaround\nYour passionate defense transforms the room. \"This is the Reconquista spirit!\" nobles shout. The Granada land promises ignite wild enthusiasm—this isn't just taxation, it's opportunity for expansion and glory. \"We finish what our ancestors started!\" Even Don García de Mendoza rises: \"Your Majesty is right—we became strong through the sword!\" The tithe comparison convinces skeptics. Your challenge—\"Does this Cortes not recognize the advantages?\"—inspires rather than offends. Nobles compete to speak in favor. The cold reception forgotten—this becomes a rallying moment.\n\nRoll your d100 when ready."

One whispers excitedly to his neighbor: \"Land in the south...\" But their enthusiasm is isolated, swallowed by the broader unease.\n\nDon García de Mendoza remains standing, his face tight. \"Your Majesty, with respect—I serve faithfully with the forty men my estates can support. Are you suggesting this makes me less valuable to the crusade?\" Several other nobles of similar standing shift uncomfortably, clearly sharing his concern. The implication that they should \"ask themselves why\" they don't field larger retinues has landed as an insult rather than inspiration.\n\nDon Pedro de Velasco nods slowly but doesn't sit. \"Your Majesty clarifies that the crusade ends when Granada falls. But Granada city alone could require years to reduce, and Your Majesty speaks of 'every mosque becoming a church.' That could mean pacifying the entire kingdom—a decade or more of eight percent taxation.\" Murmurs of agreement spread through the benches.\n\nNear the front, the Count of Medina Sidonia's representative—a careful man who has until now remained neutral—leans to his neighbor and says something that makes both men frown. The tithe comparison hasn't convinced them; they already pay tithes to the Church, and this would be additional burden.\n\nThe representatives of the three resistant houses exchange satisfied glances. The Baron de Medina's man makes a note on a piece of parchment, clearly preparing to speak against the proposal.\n\nDon Íñigo the Elder rises again, trying to rally support: \"Surely we can see—\" But another voice cuts across him.\n\n\"Your Majesty!\" A nobleman from the middle benches stands—Don Rodrigo de Perea, a respected figure among the lesser nobility. \"The compensation is generous for great houses with hundreds of knights. But what of those of us with twenty men? Thirty? We pay eight percent and receive compensation for our small retinues that doesn't offset the burden. How is this just?\"\n\nAt least fifteen nobles nod vigorously. The question hangs in the air, pointed and legitimate.\n\nThe hall watches you, waiting. The atmosphere has grown more tense rather than less. Álvaro shifts beside you, his expression carefully neutral but his eyes calculating. Cardinal Capranica observes with interest, pen in hand, clearly taking notes on this display of Castilian politics.\n\nThe Cortes expects an answer—or some acknowledgment of their concerns."

          "text": "**NEW FACTORS IN FAVOR:**\n\n1. **Humility**: Opening with religious humility and acknowledging he's \"but a man\" is powerful\n2. **Voluntary surrender of power**: \"I will not impose this tax without Cortes approval\" - giving them real voice despite having authority\n3. **Unity appeal**: \"Together we stand\" resonates with tradition\n4. **Clear timeline**: \"2 more years\" maximum, with hard deadline of December 1433\n5. **Concrete endpoint**: Very specific - take Granada next year, consecrate mosques the year after, sing Te Deum together\n6. **Direct apology**: \"I humbly ask forgiveness\" for the insult - shows character\n7. **Genuine inquiry**: Asking them to explain the math shows he's listening and learning\n8. **Reasonable timeframe**: 2 years of 8% is much more palatable than indefinite duration\n9. **Collaborative tone**: Complete shift from confrontational to consultative\n10. **Hard deadline**: \"December 1433 whichever comes first\" removes the indefinite fear\n\n**REMAINING FACTORS AGAINST:**\n\n1. **Math still unclear**: For a 30-man retinue, does compensation truly offset 8%?\n2. **Trust in timeline**: Can he really conquer all Granada in 2 years?\n3. **\"Just relation\" caveat**: If estate is large but fields few men, they still lose\n4. **Resistant houses still opposed**: They won't be swayed by any speech\n5. **Financial exhaustion**: Many nobles are already broke from 8 months campaign\n\n**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:** This is a strong recovery. The humility, clear timeline, hard deadline, and genuine apology should significantly improve the reception. The voluntary surrender of power despite having authority is particularly powerful - it shows strength and respect. However, the fundamental financial concerns remain for some nobles.\n\nThis should move things from \"poor\" into at least \"mixed/positive\" territory, possibly into \"success\" range.\n\nEvaluation of Your Recovery Speech\n\nNEW FACTORS STRONGLY IN FAVOR:\n\nHumility and faith: Opening with religious humility resonates deeply in this era\n\nVoluntary power surrender: \"I will not impose without your approval\" despite having authority—shows respect and strength\n\nClear timeline: \"2 more years maximum\" is concrete and believable\n\nHard deadline: \"December 1433 or when crusade ends, whichever comes first\" removes indefinite duration fear\n\nSpecific vision: Take Granada 1432, consecrate 1433, sing Te Deum together—vivid and inspiring\n\nGenuine apology: Direct acknowledgment of poor word choice shows character\n\nCollaborative tone: \"I seek to learn\" transforms dynamic from king commanding to king consulting\n\nUnity appeal: \"Together we stand\" invokes Castilian martial tradition\n\nTactical brilliance: Offering hard deadline removes primary objection\n\nShows papal bull: Physical reminder of your authority makes voluntary surrender more impressive\n\nREMAINING CONCERNS:\n\nMathematics still uncertain: Does 30-man compensation truly offset 8% for smaller estates?\n\n\"If in just relation\" caveat: Large estate with small retinue still loses\n\nResistant houses unmoved: Three representatives still hostile regardless\n\nFinancial exhaustion: Some nobles genuinely can't afford any increase\n\nTrust in timeline: Can Granada really fall in 2 years?\n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT: This is a masterful recovery. The combination of humility, clear timeline with hard deadline, genuine apology, and voluntary surrender of power should dramatically shift the mood. You've addressed the primary concerns (indefinite duration, insult to smaller houses) while showing both strength and wisdom. This should move significantly positive.\n\nD100 Table: Cortes Response to Recovery Speech\n\n1-3: STILL HOSTILE - Suspicious of Manipulation\nThe resistant houses' representatives stand immediately. \"Fine words, but December 1433 is still two years of bleeding us dry!\" They argue you're trying to manipulate them with false humility. \"The papal bull gives you power—this 'consultation' is theater!\" A few nobles nod skeptically. The apology dismissed as tactical rather than genuine. But this is now a small minority—most of the hall doesn't share this cynicism.\n\n4-10: SKEPTICAL - Concerns Remain\nDon Rodrigo de Perea acknowledges the apology but presses the math question seriously: \"Your Majesty, I appreciate your words, but I need actual numbers. If my estate yields 100,000 maravedís yearly, I pay 8,000. If I field 30 men for 6 months at 50-80 maravedís monthly, I receive perhaps 12,000. That profits me 4,000. But what if my estate yields 200,000? Then I pay 16,000 but still receive only 12,000—a loss of 4,000.\" Others nod—the math matters. They need specifics, not generalities.\n\n11-22: CAUTIOUS - Partial Acceptance\nThe mood softens noticeably. Many nobles nod at the December 1433 deadline—that's reasonable. The apology lands well with Don García and others who took offense. But financial concerns persist. \"Two years is manageable, but we're already strained,\" someone calls. Don Pedro de Velasco: \"Your Majesty shows wisdom in consulting us. Can we discuss modifications—perhaps 7% instead of 8%? Or phased implementation?\" The tone is now collaborative rather than hostile.\n\n23-35: MIXED POSITIVE - Warming Considerably\nThe voluntary surrender of authority impresses many nobles. \"He didn't have to ask us,\" someone murmurs appreciatively. The hard deadline removes major objection—two years with clear end is acceptable. Don Íñigo the Elder: \"His Majesty shows the wisdom of a true king!\" Multiple nobles nod at the apology. But practical questions remain: \"Can someone calculate the breakeven point? At what estate size do you profit versus lose?\" Interest in making it work rather than rejecting outright.\n\n36-50: MODEST SUCCESS - Clear Shift\nThe hall's atmosphere transforms. Nobles sit forward, engaged rather than defensive. The December 1433 deadline is the breakthrough—multiple voices: \"Two years we can manage!\" Your humility and apology win over previously offended nobles. Don García de Mendoza stands: \"Your Majesty's grace in apologizing shows true nobility.\" The unity appeal resonates. Even some initially hostile nobles look thoughtful. Don Pedro: \"Let us work through the mathematics together, as Your Majesty suggests.\" Passage now likely with minor refinements.\n\n51-65: SUCCESS - Strong Support Building\nYour speech works powerfully. The voluntary surrender of power despite holding the bull impresses the entire hall. \"This is how a king should rule,\" someone says loudly. The hard deadline removes resistance—\"Only until December 1433? That's fair!\" Your apology to smaller houses generates real warmth. Don Rodrigo de Perea stands: \"Your Majesty honors us by seeking our counsel. Let us examine the compensation tables together and ensure justice for all estates.\" Even neutral nobles now lean supportive. The resistant houses isolated.\n\n66-78: GOOD SUCCESS - Enthusiastic Response\nThe hall erupts in appreciative murmurs. Multiple nobles rise simultaneously. \"His Majesty shows true wisdom!\" The contrast between holding absolute authority and choosing consultation moves many deeply. Don Pedro de Velasco: \"This is the unity Castile needs! Two years with clear end—we can accomplish this together!\" Your apology generates spontaneous applause from smaller houses. Several nobles call out: \"Let us help refine the details!\" The vision of singing Te Deum together in Granada 1433 inspires. Path to passage clear and strong.\n\n79-88: GREAT SUCCESS - Near-Unanimous Support\nYour humility and wisdom transform the entire dynamic. Don Íñigo the Elder stands with tears in his eyes: \"This is the king Castile has prayed for!\" The voluntary consultation despite having power stuns the assembly—this is unprecedented royal behavior. The hard deadline satisfies even skeptics. Your apology wins over previously hostile nobles. Don García: \"Your Majesty's grace exceeds his victories!\" Multiple nobles stand: \"We will make this work together!\" Even some resistant house representatives look uncertain—their masters' position increasingly isolated. Archbishop Gutiérrez beams.\n\n89-96: OVERWHELMING SUCCESS - Triumph\nThe Cortes rises to its feet as one. The combination of humility, power voluntarily shared, clear timeline, and genuine apology creates a moment of profound unity. \"This is kingship blessed by God!\" voices call out. Don Pedro de Velasco: \"Your Majesty, we would be honored to refine this law with you. Two years to complete the Reconquista—Castile united!\" Even hardened skeptics moved by your grace. Cardinal Capranica watches with clear approval. The resistant houses' representatives sit alone, isolated. This becomes a defining moment of your reign—the king who could command but chose to consult.\n\n97-100: LEGENDARY MOMENT - Historic Unity\nYour speech transcends the immediate question and becomes something greater. Nobles weep openly at your humility and wisdom. The voluntary surrender of power while holding the papal bull high creates an almost sacred moment—power offered to God and the kingdom rather than grasped. \"Like David before the Ark!\" someone shouts. The entire Cortes surges forward, nobles calling out: \"We are with you, Your Majesty! To Granada! To victory!\" Don Íñigo embraces you openly. Even the resistant houses' representatives stand reluctantly, unable to oppose this tide. This moment will be remembered for generations—the young king who united Castile through grace rather than force. The law will pass with acclamation.\n\nRoll your d100 when ready."

          "text": "The Warming Hall\n\nYour words settle over the assembly like a benediction. For a long moment, silence—then something shifts in the atmosphere.\n\nDon García de Mendoza, who moments ago stood offended, rises slowly. \"Your Majesty...\" His voice carries genuine emotion. \"Your grace in apologizing shows true nobility. I withdraw any offense taken.\" He bows his head respectfully and sits. Several nobles near him nod approvingly, murmuring among themselves.\n\nFrom the middle benches, an older nobleman stands—Don Fernando de Guzmán, a respected voice among the middling nobility. \"His Majesty didn't have to consult us,\" he says clearly. \"The papal bull grants him authority to impose this tax. Yet here he stands, seeking our counsel.\" He gestures to the bull on the table. \"This shows wisdom beyond his years.\"\n\nScattered applause breaks out, growing stronger. Not universal—perhaps a third of the assembly—but genuine. The mood has unmistakably warmed.\n\nDon Íñigo the Elder seizes the moment, rising with enthusiasm. \"December 1433! A clear end! Two years to complete what our ancestors began centuries ago!\" His voice rings through the hall. \"This is manageable! This is just!\"\n\nMore nobles nod. The hard deadline has clearly removed the fear of indefinite taxation. You hear fragments of conversation: \"Two years I can afford...\" \"Better than no end in sight...\" \"If it truly ends in 1433...\"\n\nBut then Don Rodrigo de Perea stands again, his expression thoughtful rather than hostile. \"Your Majesty, you ask us to help examine the mathematics. I think we should.\" He pulls out a piece of parchment and begins calculating aloud, his voice carrying in the now-attentive hall.\n\n\"Let us say a nobleman holds estates yielding 150,000 maravedís annually. At eight percent, he pays 12,000 to the crusade tax. Now suppose he fields thirty men—twenty foot soldiers at 50 maravedís monthly, ten mounted men-at-arms at 80 maravedís monthly. For six months of campaign, that's...\" He pauses, working the numbers. \"6,000 for the foot soldiers, 4,800 for the mounted. Total compensation: 10,800 maravedís.\"\n\nHe looks up. \"This nobleman pays 12,000, receives 10,800. He loses 1,200 maravedís despite serving honorably with thirty men. Is this the intent?\"\n\nThe hall goes quiet, nobles mentally working through their own calculations. This is the question that matters—the actual mathematics of who profits and who loses.\n\nDon Pedro de Velasco stands beside Don Rodrigo. \"And what of a greater house? An estate of 400,000 maravedís paying 32,000, but fielding 120 men? That could bring back...\" He calculates. \"Perhaps 43,000 in compensation. A profit of 11,000.\" He spreads his hands. \"The larger houses profit handsomely. The smaller houses who still serve faithfully—they lose.\"\n\nSeveral nobles nod slowly. This is the crux of their concern, laid bare with actual numbers.\n\nBut the tone is no longer hostile—it's collaborative. These men are trying to make the system work, not to reject it entirely.\n\nNear the back, you notice the representatives of the three resistant houses conferring quietly. The Baron de Medina's man looks frustrated—the mood has shifted away from outright opposition, and they're being left behind.\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez leans forward slightly, watching with interest. Cardinal Capranica continues taking notes, his expression unreadable but attentive.\n\nÁlvaro leans close and murmurs very quietly: \"They're engaging with the details now, not rejecting the principle. This is progress. But they want the mathematics to work fairly.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo still stands, parchment in hand, awaiting your response. The Cortes watches—not with hostility, but with genuine interest in how you'll address this legitimate concern about the compensation structure."

          "text": "**FACTORS IN FAVOR:**\n1. **Major concession**: From 8% to 5% is a 37.5% reduction from the proposal - shows he's truly listening\n2. **Same as original**: 5% was what they've been paying, so this is familiar\n3. **Added benefits**: Still get compensation for troops AND elimination of regular crown tax\n4. **Hard deadline remains**: December 1433 end date still applies\n5. **Collaborative tone**: \"Together with the nobles\" appeals to their pride\n6. **Acknowledges their input**: \"The words of this council sway me\" shows respect\n7. **Mathematics now work**: At 5%, almost any noble fielding troops will profit or break even\n8. **Religious framing**: \"Kingdom serving God\" resonates\n9. **Shows flexibility**: Willing to negotiate demonstrates strength, not weakness\n10. **Status quo + benefits**: They pay what they already paid but get compensation and no crown tax\n\n**REMAINING CONCERNS:**\n1. **Resistant houses still opposed**: They opposed assessment program entirely\n2. **Some exhaustion remains**: Though reduced burden helps\n3. **Precedent concerns**: Some might still worry about permanent changes\n4. **Great houses lose potential profit**: Those who could profit at 8% now get less\n\n**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:** This should be extremely successful. Juan has given them almost everything they want - kept the tax rate the same as before, added compensation for troops, eliminated regular crown taxes, kept the hard deadline, and shown genuine willingness to collaborate. The mathematics now work for almost everyone. Only the most hardline opponents could reject this.\n\nLet me create a table that reflects this should be very positive, with only very low rolls resulting in continued resistance.\n\nEvaluation of Your Concession\n\nMAJOR FACTORS IN FAVOR:\n\nDramatic concession: From 8% to 5% is a 37.5% reduction—shows genuine listening\n\nStatus quo rate: 5% is what they've already been paying under the crusade tax\n\nPure additions: They keep familiar rate BUT gain troop compensation AND lose regular crown tax\n\nMathematics transform: At 5%, nearly any noble fielding troops will profit or break even\n\nHard deadline remains: December 1433 still applies—temporary nature assured\n\nCollaboration validated: Their input directly changed the proposal—empowers them\n\nShows strength through flexibility: Willingness to negotiate demonstrates confidence, not weakness\n\nReligious appeal: \"Together with nobles\" and \"serving God\" resonates deeply\n\nFace-saving: Nobles can claim victory in negotiation\n\nPractical benefits: Most nobles now clearly benefit from the structure\n\nMINIMAL REMAINING CONCERNS:\n\nResistant houses' principles: Three representatives opposed assessment entirely, not just rate\n\nGreat houses lose profit: Those who would've profited at 8% get less (but still profit)\n\nExhaustion factor: Some nobles still financially strained regardless of rate\n\nPrecedent worries: Small minority might fear any permanent change\n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT: This should be overwhelmingly successful. You've essentially given them everything they asked for—kept the rate they already pay, added compensation, removed other taxes, kept hard deadline, and demonstrated genuine partnership. Only the most hardline opponents could reject this. The mathematics now work favorably for almost everyone.\n\nD100 Table: Cortes Response to 5% Concession\n\n1-2: IMPOSSIBLE DEMAND - Resistant Houses Reject Entirely\nThe Baron de Medina's representative stands immediately: \"Any crusade tax is illegitimate! We reject this assessment program entirely!\" But he's utterly isolated. The rest of the hall stares at him in disbelief. Even his allies won't join this absurd position. \"Sit down!\" someone shouts. \"The King just gave us everything!\" This transparent obstructionism backfires completely—these representatives now look like unreasonable rebels.\n\n3-8: MINOR GRUMBLING - Small Minority Still Resistant\nA handful of nobles—perhaps five or six—still look uncomfortable. One mutters about \"precedent\" and \"permanent structures.\" The three resistant houses' representatives sit stone-faced, refusing to applaud. But they're utterly alone. The overwhelming majority of the hall has moved on. This tiny faction is now clearly isolated as obstructionists rather than legitimate opposition.\n\n9-18: CAUTIOUS ACCEPTANCE - Final Details Needed\nMost nobles nod approvingly, but Don Pedro de Velasco raises a hand: \"Your Majesty's generosity is clear. Before we vote, could we clarify a few procedural matters? Payment schedules, troop verification processes, the exact formula for estates with mixed forces?\" These are reasonable administrative questions, not opposition. The principle is accepted—they're just ensuring smooth implementation. Passage certain after brief discussion.\n\n19-32: POSITIVE - Clear Approval\nSolid applause breaks out across the hall. Don Rodrigo de Perea stands: \"Your Majesty has answered our concerns with grace and wisdom. At five percent with compensation, the mathematics work fairly for all.\" Multiple nobles rise to voice agreement. Don García de Mendoza: \"This is justice! Those who fight are rewarded, others contribute fairly!\" The resistant houses' representatives sit isolated. Archbishop Gutiérrez nods approvingly. Strong majority support—passage virtually assured.\n\n33-48: GOOD SUCCESS - Strong Support\nThe hall erupts in appreciative applause. \"Five percent!\" voices call out. \"The King listens!\" Don Íñigo the Elder: \"This is how a wise king rules—with his nobles, not over them!\" Don Fernando de Guzmán stands: \"Your Majesty has transformed this from burden to opportunity. We profit from serving, pay fairly when we cannot. This is just!\" Multiple nobles rise to endorse. The three resistant representatives look increasingly isolated and foolish.\n\n49-65: GREAT SUCCESS - Enthusiastic Endorsement\nThe atmosphere transforms completely. Nobles surge to their feet applauding. \"The King honors us!\" Don Rodrigo calculates aloud: \"At five percent, my 150,000 maravedí estate pays 7,500, receives perhaps 10,800 for thirty men—I profit 3,300 maravedís while serving the crusade!\" Others work similar calculations, faces lighting up. \"This rewards service perfectly!\" Don Pedro: \"We would be honored to vote immediately!\" The collaboration has created genuine partnership feeling.\n\n66-80: OVERWHELMING SUCCESS - Near Unanimous\nThe Cortes rises as one in sustained applause. \"WISDOM! JUSTICE!\" voices ring out. Don Íñigo embraces you openly: \"You have given us everything we asked and more!\" Nobles compete to praise your flexibility and wisdom. \"He could have imposed eight percent by papal authority—instead he listened and lowered it to five!\" The resistant houses' representatives sit alone, their isolation complete. Even some look like they might break ranks. This becomes a triumph of collaborative governance.\n\n81-92: TRIUMPHANT MOMENT - Acclamation\nThe hall erupts in cheering. Nobles rush forward to pledge support. \"To the King! To Granada! To December 1433!\" Don García de Mendoza, tears in his eyes: \"Your Majesty has shown us what true kingship means—power shared in grace!\" The mathematics spread through the hall like wildfire—nobles realizing they'll actually profit. \"We pay five percent but gain compensation and lose crown tax—this is brilliant!\" Multiple nobles call for immediate vote by acclamation. The resistant houses' representatives look stunned.\n\n93-98: LEGENDARY SUCCESS - Historic Unity\nYour concession creates a moment of profound kingdom unity. The Cortes erupts in simultaneous cheering, applause, and pledges of loyalty. Nobles embrace each other, celebrating. \"This is the Reconquista spirit renewed!\" Don Rodrigo's voice rises above the din: \"Your Majesty has united this kingdom through wisdom! We are honored to serve such a king!\" Even the resistant houses' representatives stand reluctantly—one actually applauds. Cardinal Capranica writes furiously, clearly impressed. Archbishop Gutiérrez declares: \"God's grace is upon this assembly!\" This will be remembered as the moment Juan II transformed Castilian governance.\n\n99-100: TRANSCENDENT MOMENT - The Cortes Transformed\nSomething extraordinary happens. The combination of your earlier humility, the voluntary surrender of power, and now this generous concession creates an almost spiritual experience. Nobles weep openly. Don Íñigo falls to his knees: \"This is the king we have prayed for!\" The entire Cortes—including all three resistant houses' representatives—rises and begins singing \"Te Deum Laudamus\" spontaneously. Your vision of singing it together in Granada 1433 has begun here, now, in this hall. The assembly pledges not just support but devotion. This transcends politics and becomes a sacred covenant between king and kingdom. Songs will be written about this day.\n\nRoll your d100 when ready."

Don Fernando de Guzmán should stand to endorse it, saying it transforms burden to opportunity. Multiple nobles should rise to endorse. The three resistant representatives should look increasingly isolated and foolish.\n\nThis is a strong positive outcome. The tax law should be clearly heading toward passage. I should narrate:\n1. Immediate positive reaction with applause\n2. Key supporters standing to endorse\n3. The mathematics working out favorably\n4. The resistant houses looking isolated\n5. A sense that passage is now likely/certain\n6. Perhaps some procedural next steps\n\nI should keep this relatively short (we're in active dialogue/debate, so 3-5 paragraphs) and stop at a natural point where Juan can decide what to do next - likely moving toward a vote or allowing debate to continue.\n\nThe Hall Embraces the Compromise\n\nThe moment you say \"five percent,\" the atmosphere transforms.\n\nApplause breaks out—not scattered or hesitant, but solid and sustained. It begins with Don Íñigo the Elder rising to his feet, clapping enthusiastically, but spreads rapidly through the benches. Within moments, perhaps forty nobles are standing, their approval unmistakable.\n\n\"The King listens!\" someone shouts from the middle benches.\n\nDon Fernando de Guzmán stands, his weathered face breaking into a genuine smile. \"Your Majesty has transformed this from burden to opportunity!\" His voice carries clearly over the applause. \"At five percent with compensation for those who serve—this is not taxation, this is partnership! We profit from serving the crusade, we contribute fairly when we cannot. This is justice!\"\n\nMultiple other nobles rise to echo his words. A younger knight calls out: \"Five percent we're already paying—but now with compensation and no crown tax!\" Another: \"The King could have imposed eight by papal authority, but he listened to us!\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea remains standing, but now he's nodding, recalculating on his parchment. \"At five percent...\" He works through the numbers quickly. \"My 150,000 maravedí estate pays 7,500. With thirty men for six months, I receive 10,800 in compensation. I profit 3,300 maravedís while serving honorably in the crusade.\" He looks up, his expression transformed. \"Your Majesty, this works. This truly works fairly.\"\n\nAround the hall, nobles begin doing similar calculations, faces lighting up as they realize the mathematics now favor them. The murmuring is excited rather than anxious—men discovering they can actually profit from military service while contributing to the kingdom's greatest cause.\n\nDon Pedro de Velasco stands beside Don Rodrigo. \"Your Majesty has shown us what governance should be—ruling with your nobles, not over them. This assembly would be honored to support this law.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez is beaming openly. Cardinal Capranica continues his notes, but you catch what might be the hint of an approving nod.\n\nThe three resistant houses' representatives sit utterly isolated. The Baron de Medina's man still has his arms crossed, but he looks increasingly foolish. Around him, the hall has moved on—embracing not just the law, but the process that created it. One of the Count of Niebla's representatives actually leans back, his expression uncertain, as if reconsidering his master's position.\n\nDon Íñigo the Elder's voice booms out: \"Your Majesty! Shall we proceed to a vote? Or does this assembly wish to debate further?\" He's clearly eager to lock in this victory while the mood is favorable.\n\nThe Cortes turns to you expectantly. The strong support is clear—but you could allow more debate if you wish, or move directly to a vote and secure the law's passage while enthusiasm runs high. The chamber awaits your guidance on how to proceed."

Nobles surge to their feet—first the loyal houses, then the middling nobility, then even some who had looked skeptical earlier. Don Rodrigo de Perea stands. Don Fernando de Guzmán stands. Don García de Mendoza stands. Don Pedro de Velasco stands.\n\nWithin moments, nearly fifty nobles are on their feet. The standing figures fill the chamber, a clear and overwhelming majority.\n\nThe three resistant houses' representatives remain seated, along with perhaps five other nobles—men too exhausted financially to afford even five percent, or those who philosophically oppose any expansion of royal taxation. But they look isolated and irrelevant, a tiny island in a sea of support.\n\nDon Íñigo counts aloud, his voice triumphant: \"Fifty-two in favor!\" He turns to the seated figures. \"Those opposed?\"\n\nThe Baron de Medina's representative stands slowly, his face tight with anger. \"Opposed.\" The Count of Niebla's man rises reluctantly. \"Opposed.\" But the third representative—from Don García de Sotomayor's household—remains seated, staring at the floor. Even he cannot bring himself to vote against this obviously just compromise.\n\n\"Three opposed,\" Don Íñigo announces. \"The remaining members abstain.\"\n\nHe turns to you and bows deeply. \"Your Majesty, the Cortes has spoken. The crusade tax law passes with overwhelming support—fifty-two votes in favor, three opposed, five abstentions.\"\n\nApplause erupts again, sustained and genuine. Nobles begin embracing each other, celebrating not just the law but the process that created it. You hear fragments of excited conversation: \"Finally, warriors rewarded properly!\" \"Only until 1433—we can do this!\" \"The King actually listened to us!\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez rises, his voice carrying authority: \"Let it be recorded that on this day, November 15, 1431, the Cortes of Castile united in support of His Majesty's crusade. May God bless this endeavor and grant us victory in Granada!\"\n\n\"Amen!\" the hall responds as one.\n\nÁlvaro leans close, his voice quiet but satisfied: \"Well done, Your Majesty. You've secured the taxation, demonstrated partnership with the nobility, and isolated the resistant houses all at once. Now they sit alone, their opposition looking like mere obstruction.\"\n\nThe morning's work is complete. The crusade tax law is passed. But you mentioned in your opening speech that you had other matters to address—the excommunications, the Crown Marshals, the vision for after the crusade. The Cortes waits to see what comes next.\n\nWhat do you wish to do?"

The nobles seem relieved—an opportunity to celebrate the morning's success and steel themselves for whatever tomorrow may bring.\n\nDon Íñigo the Elder rises. \"His Majesty shows wisdom once more! Let us reconvene tomorrow, refreshed and ready.\" He raises his voice: \"To the King! To the crusade! To Granada!\"\n\n\"To Granada!\" the hall responds, the cry echoing off the stone walls.\n\nAs the formal session dissolves, the Great Hall transforms into something more relaxed. Nobles cluster in groups, discussing the morning's events. You hear snatches of animated conversation—war stories from the campaign season, calculations of expected compensation, speculation about tomorrow's agenda. Wine is brought in by servants, and the atmosphere grows increasingly celebratory.\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea approaches with several middling nobles, bowing respectfully. \"Your Majesty, we are grateful for your willingness to hear our concerns. The compromise honors both those who fight and those who support in other ways.\" The men with him nod enthusiastically, clearly pleased with the outcome.\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez makes his way to you through the crowd. \"Your Majesty, I would be honored to witness the signing. What you accomplished today—ruling through partnership rather than decree—this is governance blessed by God.\" His eyes shine with genuine approval. \"I will ensure the document is properly witnessed and recorded for posterity.\"\n\nEven some of the previously neutral nobles seek you out—offering congratulations on the victories at Alcalá and Málaga, asking about the Queen's health, expressing eagerness for the spring campaign. The successful morning has opened doors that might have remained closed.\n\nYou notice, however, that the three resistant houses' representatives have withdrawn to a corner, speaking in low, urgent tones. The Baron de Medina's man gestures sharply, clearly angry. But they are isolated now—the rest of the hall pays them no attention, caught up in the positive mood.\n\nAs the afternoon wears on, Álvaro finds a moment to speak privately. \"Masterful, Your Majesty,\" he says quietly. \"You secured everything we needed—the taxation structure, the compensation mechanism, the hard deadline—and made them feel like partners in the decision. The resistant houses now look like unreasonable obstructionists.\" He pauses. \"Tomorrow will be more difficult. The excommunications and Crown Marshals will shock them. But you've built goodwill today that should carry through.\"\n\nBy evening, the law has been redrafted by scribes under Álvaro's supervision. The document is brought to a smaller chamber where Archbishop Gutiérrez, Cardinal Capranica, Álvaro, and several senior nobles wait as witnesses.\n\nThe parchment reads clearly:\n\nCRUSADE TAXATION LAW OF 1431\n\nBy the authority granted in the Papal Bull \"Inter Cetera Divinae\" and with the consent of the Cortes of Castile:\n\n1. All regular feudal payments and crown taxes are suspended for the duration of the crusade\n2. A tax of five percent (5%) on assessed noble estate revenues shall be collected annually\n3. Compensation shall be paid as follows:\n\nMounted knight with full armor: 120 maravedís per month\n\nMounted man-at-arms with armor: 80 maravedís per month\n\nFoot soldier with arms: 50 maravedís per month\n\nUnarmored fighter: 30 maravedís per month\n4. This tax shall remain in effect until December 31, 1433, or until the crusade is completed (defined as the fall of Granada city and the consecration of all mosques as churches), whichever comes first\n5. Passed by the Cortes of Castile on November 15, 1431, with 52 votes in favor, 3 opposed, 5 abstentions\n\nYou sign with firm, clear strokes. Archbishop Gutiérrez signs as primary witness, followed by Cardinal Capranica. Álvaro adds his seal as Royal Constable. Several senior nobles add their marks.\n\nThe law is now official.\n\nAs you retire for the evening, you can hear the celebration continuing in the halls below—nobles drinking, singing songs of past crusade victories, swearing oaths of loyalty for the spring campaign. Tomorrow's session will be very different. Tomorrow, you announce the excommunications.\n\nSTATUS UPDATE:\n\nDate: November 15, 1431 (Evening)\nLocation: Valladolid Royal Palace\nMajor Event: Crusade Tax Law passed (5% rate, compensation structure, expires December 1433)\nCortes Support: Strong (52-3-5 vote)\nNext Session: November 16, 1431 (Excommunications, Crown Marshals, eternal crusade vision)\n\nWhat would you like to do as evening falls? Prepare for tomorrow's more difficult announcements? Speak with any particular advisors or nobles? Or shall we advance to the next morning's session?"

Don Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, Count of Niebla\n\nEstate location: Near Huelva, western Andalusia\n\nOriginal tax owed: 8,000 maravedís\n\nOffense: Threatened royal assessor with armed guards, denied entry to estates\n\nCurrent status: Has made no payment, no communication\n\n2. Don Juan Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán, Baron de Medina\n\nEstate location: Near Medina Sidonia, north of Cádiz\n\nOriginal tax owed: 8,000 maravedís\n\nOffense: Had royal assessor beaten and forcibly removed from his lands\n\nCurrent status: Has made no payment, sent threatening message to Toledo\n\n3. Don García de Sotomayor\n\nEstate location: Extremadura, near Mérida\n\nOriginal tax owed: 15,000 maravedís\n\nOffense: Burned the three-seal letter of authority in front of the assessor\n\nCurrent status: Has made no payment, fortifying his castle\n\nÁlvaro's expression is hard. \"These three didn't just refuse payment—they committed violence against crown officials or destroyed papal documents. Cardinal Capranica agrees these offenses warrant excommunication and seizure of lands.\"\n\nHe pulls out another, longer document. \"As for nobles still owing taxes...\" He unrolls a comprehensive list. \"This is current as of three days ago, compiled by the assessors before we left Toledo.\"\n\nThe document is detailed:\n\nNOBLES OWING CRUSADE TAX - STATUS AS OF NOVEMBER 12, 1431\n\nCATEGORY A: VIOLENT RESISTANCE (To be excommunicated)\n\nCount of Niebla: 8,000 maravedís\n\nBaron de Medina: 8,000 maravedís\n\nDon García de Sotomayor: 15,000 maravedís\n\nSubtotal: 31,000 maravedís\n\nCATEGORY B: CONTINUED REFUSAL (No violence, but complete non-cooperation)\n\nDon García de Guzmán (Seville): 22,000 maravedís - armed guards prevent entry, claims under review for six months\n\nDuke of Arévalo: 35,000 maravedís - claims ancient tax exemption, won't open books\n\nCount of Osma: 18,000 maravedís - refuses to allow crown clerks access to records\n\nSubtotal: 75,000 maravedís\n\nCATEGORY C: PARTIAL PAYMENT (Some cooperation, but incomplete)\n\nDuke of Medina Sidonia: 28,000 maravedís still owed (paid 15,000 of 43,000 total)\n\nCount of Benavente: 17,000 maravedís still owed (paid 8,000 of 25,000, claims plague losses)\n\nVarious Mendoza branches: ~45,000 maravedís owed (made \"voluntary contributions\" below assessed amounts)\n\nSubtotal: 90,000 maravedís\n\nCATEGORY D: APPEALS IN PROCESS (Cooperated with assessment, disputing amounts)\n\nApproximately 40 estates with appeals pending\n\nAmounts range from 500 to 8,000 maravedís per estate\n\nMost are legitimate disputes over harvest losses, debt accounting, etc.\n\nSubtotal: ~208,000 maravedís (subject to appeal adjustments)\n\nCATEGORY E: SCATTERED RESISTANCE (Small estates, remote locations)\n\nApproximately 150-200 minor estates\n\nIndividual amounts: 200-3,000 maravedís each\n\nIssues: remote locations, poor communication, administrative delays\n\nSubtotal: ~590,000 maravedís\n\nGRAND TOTAL OUTSTANDING: Approximately 994,000 maravedís\n\nÁlvaro looks up from the document. \"The three we're excommunicating owe only 31,000—barely three percent of the total outstanding. But they're the ones who committed violence or destroyed papal documents. Making examples of them sends the message without requiring us to excommunicate fifty nobles.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"The others in Categories B and C—particularly Medina Sidonia, who actually paid partial amounts—will be watching very carefully tomorrow. If we excommunicate the violent rebels but leave room for those still negotiating, we give them incentive to comply without forcing desperate resistance.\"\n\nHe taps the Crown Marshal documents sitting beside the excommunication bulls. \"After you announce the excommunications, present the Marshals. Show them you have both the authority to punish and the systematic means to enforce. Then—\" he smiles slightly, \"—end with the eternal crusade vision. Give them something inspiring to think about instead of dwelling on the punishment.\"\n\n\"The three representatives of the condemned houses are still in the palace. They don't know what's coming tomorrow. The shock will be considerable.\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts for tomorrow's approach?"

All except a very few.\n\n\nAs king I am responsible for my taxes to be fair and just. But how can they be fair and just when some beat my crown tax assessors? Not only is it an affront to the crown and against the integrity of all other dutiful nobles of the realm, it also is an affront to our holy cause as well.\n\n\nI trust the Cortes understands that I must defend their interest as well as our common interest in a successfull crusade and take powerful measures to adress these issues.\n\n\nI walk over to the table where the three decrees of excommunication lay. I pick them up.\n\n\nThese three decrees excommunicate Don Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, Count of Niebla, Don Juan Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán, Baron de Medina and Don García de Sotomayor. These three nobles have committed crimes so outlandish that after carefull consideration, me and the church see no other option than to excommunicate them.\n\n\nI pick up the first bull.\n\n\nDon Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, you threatened my tax assessors with violence, denied entry to your estate after repeated demands from the crown to do so. You have made no payment in accordance with the rightfull tax, knowing full well that you were obliged to do so. You insult my name and those of every noble paying his fair share. You are a disgrace and not worthy of your lands and title and I declare them forfeit and I hereby excommunicate you. I will take your titles from you and give them to a noble that understands his noble obligations. I have carefully considered your offence and offer you the chance to fight in the crusade to rid yourself of sin and earn again favor in the eyes of your fellow men and in the eyes of our Lord.\n\n\nI pick up the second bull.\n\n\nDon Juan Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán, you have attacked the crown's own representative and forcibly removed them from your land. What did you think was going to happen? You and everyone here knows that this offence cannot stand. It will not stand! I declare you excommunicated and your lands forfeit. Your lands and titles belong to a true Castillian and I will make sure someone worthy will take your place as lord of your estate. I have considered your offence carefully and after this council, you will be brought before my court to further determine your sentence.\n\n\nI pick up the third bull.\n\n\nDon García de Sotomayor, you took the three-seal letter of authority from my tax representative and willingly and knowingly burned it in front of him before removing him from your estate. Not only did you resist paying these just and fair taxes, you felt like burning the very seal of my aothority and that of the church. This willfull act of rebellion can only have one response. After careful consideration, I declare you excommunicated and your lands forfeit. You are a cancer in our kingdom and I will cut you out. Depending on your further actions, I will consider offering you a place in the crusade where you can redeem yourself.\n\n\nYou three insult not just me, but the Cortes as well. This is what will happen. You and your representatives will return under safe conduct to your homes. Know that I will come for you and take what does not belong to you.\n\n\nDraft a d100 table of possible responses from the cortes."

          "text": "**FACTORS IN FAVOR:**\n1. **Justice is clear**: These three committed actual violence or destroyed official documents\n2. **Yesterday's goodwill**: The successful taxation compromise built political capital\n3. **Protects assessors**: Shows crown officials are protected, which most nobles see as necessary for order\n4. **Selective targeting**: Only three out of many who owe money - shows proportionality\n5. **Religious backing**: Church authority through excommunication\n6. **Offers redemption**: Two of three offered chance to redeem through crusade service\n7. **Safe conduct offered**: Not executing them immediately, giving them chance to leave\n8. **Protects compliant nobles**: \"You insult the Cortes\" frames this as defending those who paid\n9. **Clear crimes stated**: Specific offenses listed, not arbitrary punishment\n10. **Yesterday's partnership**: Built trust that makes harsh action more acceptable\n\n**FACTORS AGAINST:**\n1. **Land forfeiture is extreme**: Excommunication + land seizure is very severe\n2. **Military threat**: \"I will come for you\" promises war against nobles\n3. **Fear of precedent**: Other nobles worried this could expand\n4. **Family connections**: These houses have allies and relatives in the hall\n5. **Harsh tone**: \"Cancer in our kingdom\" is very strong language\n6. **Baron de Medina's fate unclear**: \"Brought before court to determine sentence\" could mean execution\n7. **Representatives present**: Humiliating them in front of the assembly\n8. **Shows royal power**: Some may fear this level of authority\n9. **Category B nobles nervous**: Those who also haven't paid but weren't violent\n10. **Procedural concerns**: Some may question if trial should come before sentence\n\nJuan's speech is passionate and justified, but very harsh. \n\nThe redemption pathway and targeted approach will likely soften the blow. Crusade service offers a chance for these nobles to restore honor, while the selective punishment demonstrates measured justice. The political groundwork from yesterday's successful negotiations provides a buffer, helping most nobles understand the reasoning behind these severe actions. While shock and fear will ripple through the assembly, the carefully constructed narrative of proportional response should ultimately prevail.\n\nEvaluation of Your Excommunication Announcement\n\nFACTORS IN FAVOR:\n\nClear justice: Specific, documented offenses (violence, document burning) that everyone recognizes as serious\n\nYesterday's goodwill: The taxation compromise built substantial political capital\n\nSelective enforcement: Only three of many who owe money—shows proportionality, not vindictiveness\n\nProtects assessors: Demonstrates crown officials are protected, which maintains order for everyone\n\nFrames as defending Cortes: \"You insult the Cortes as well\" makes compliant nobles the victims\n\nDual authority: Both royal and ecclesiastical backing (excommunication bulls prepared by Cardinal)\n\nRedemption offered: Two of three given crusade service option shows mercy alongside justice\n\nSafe conduct: Not executing immediately, allowing dignified departure\n\nYesterday's partnership: Built trust that this isn't arbitrary tyranny\n\nDistinguishes from others: Category B nobles (who merely refused but weren't violent) can see they're safe\n\nFACTORS AGAINST:\n\nLand forfeiture is severe: Excommunication + seizure + military threat is maximum punishment short of execution\n\nPublic humiliation: Announcing this with representatives present is deliberately shaming\n\nBaron de Medina's fate unclear: \"Brought before court\" could mean execution, alarming\n\nFear of precedent: Some nobles worry where this authority ends\n\n\"Cancer\" language: Very harsh rhetoric that may seem excessive\n\nMilitary threat: \"I will come for you\" promises noble warfare\n\nFamily connections: These houses have relatives and allies in the hall who may be offended\n\nProcedural concerns: Some may think trial should precede sentence\n\nCategory B nobles nervous: Don García de Guzmán and Duke of Arévalo wondering if they're next\n\nShows raw power: The combination of ecclesiastical and military authority may frighten fence-sitters\n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT: The justice is clear and the targeting is proportional, but this is still shocking and severe. Yesterday's partnership softens the blow. Most nobles will accept this as necessary, but there will be fear, some sympathy for the condemned, and concern about precedent. The representatives of these houses will react very badly.\n\nD100 Table: Cortes Response to Excommunication Announcements\n\n1-3: CATASTROPHIC BACKFIRE - Defensive Solidarity\nMultiple nobles surge to their feet in outrage. \"This is tyranny! Today three houses, tomorrow thirty!\" Several relatives of the condemned houses stand in support: \"My cousin may have erred, but this is destruction of noble houses!\" Fear ripples through Category B nobles—those who also haven't paid. \"We could be next!\" Don García de Guzmán looks terrified. Even some loyalists look uncomfortable with the severity. \"Land forfeiture without trial?\" The hall divides sharply, and you may have created more enemies than you punished.\n\n4-8: SERIOUS FAILURE - Sympathy for the Condemned\nThe Baron de Medina's representative stands, trembling with rage: \"You destroy us for defending our own lands? This is not justice!\" Others rise in support—relatives, allies, those who fear precedent. \"Where does this authority end?\" Don Fernando de Guzmán looks deeply troubled. The \"cancer\" language offends even neutrals. \"These are ancient houses, Your Majesty, not diseases.\" Archbishop Gutiérrez looks concerned. You've united opposition through excessive severity.\n\n9-18: FAILURE - Shocked Opposition\nHeavy silence follows your announcement, then uncomfortable murmuring. Many nobles look genuinely shocked by the severity—excommunication AND land forfeiture AND military threat. The three representatives sit stunned. But sympathy spreads: \"Violence was wrong, but this seems... extreme.\" Category B nobles visibly nervous. Don Pedro de Velasco speaks carefully: \"Your Majesty, the offenses are serious, but perhaps trial before sentence?\" Multiple nobles nod. The harsh tone has undermined the justice of the cause.\n\n19-32: POOR - Divided and Fearful\nThe hall splits visibly. Loyal houses nod grimly—Don Íñigo: \"Justice must be done.\" But many others look uncomfortable. The public humiliation troubles them. \"Brought before court to determine sentence\"—does that mean execution? Category B nobles exchange worried glances. Some whisper: \"What if they come for us next?\" The three representatives sit in stunned silence. The compliant nobles accept the necessity but are troubled by the severity. Unclear whether you've strengthened or weakened your position.\n\n33-48: MIXED - Grim Acceptance\nSilence follows your words—not hostile, but heavy. Most nobles recognize the offenses were serious. Don Rodrigo de Perea nods slowly: \"Violence against crown officials cannot stand.\" But the severity troubles many. The three representatives sit pale and silent. Their allies look torn between loyalty and self-preservation. Category B nobles relieved they weren't named but nervous about precedent. Archbishop Gutiérrez's expression is grave but approving. The justice is accepted, but the atmosphere is tense rather than supportive.\n\n49-63: MODEST SUCCESS - Grim Support\nAfter a long silence, Don Íñigo the Elder stands. \"His Majesty is right. These offenses cannot stand.\" Scattered, serious applause—not celebratory, but acknowledging necessity. Many nobles nod grimly. \"They beat assessors—what did they expect?\" The three representatives sit in shock, but no one rises to defend them. Category B nobles look relieved they weren't included. Some discomfort with severity, but general acceptance that the punishment fits the crimes. The hall is sobered but not divided.\n\n64-76: SUCCESS - Clear Support for Justice\nMultiple nobles rise as you finish. \"Justice!\" Don Fernando de Guzmán: \"Those who raise hands against the king's men cannot be tolerated!\" Solid applause spreads—not enthusiastic, but firm and serious. The selective targeting is noted approvingly: \"Only three—those who committed actual violence.\" Category B nobles visibly relieved. The three representatives sit isolated, no one meeting their eyes. Don Pedro: \"Your Majesty protects us all by protecting crown officials.\" The severity is accepted as necessary for order.\n\n77-86: GOOD SUCCESS - Strong Approval\nThe hall responds with grave but solid support. Don Íñigo: \"JUSTICE MUST BE DONE!\" Multiple nobles stand: \"They beat your assessors, burned papal seals—this is rebellion!\" The contrast with yesterday's partnership makes today's firmness more acceptable: \"He gave us fair taxation, now he enforces it fairly.\" Category B nobles clearly relieved they're distinguished from violent offenders. The three representatives sit alone and abandoned. \"Your Majesty protects those who fulfill their duties,\" someone calls. Strong support for both the justice and the message it sends.\n\n88-94: GREAT SUCCESS - Overwhelming Support\nThe hall erupts in approval. \"This is justice!\" Don Rodrigo stands: \"Your Majesty protects us all! If assessors can be beaten with impunity, law means nothing!\" Multiple nobles rise: \"They burned the three-seal letter—that's rebellion against both crown and Church!\" The selective targeting praised: \"Only those who committed violence—this is proportional justice.\" Even relatives of the condemned sit silent, unable to defend the indefensible. Category B nobles grateful they were spared. \"This is what strong kingship looks like,\" Don Fernando declares. The three representatives sit in complete isolation.\n\n95-98: TRIUMPHANT - United in Justice\nThe Cortes rises almost as one. \"JUSTICE! FOR THE CROWN! FOR THE CRUSADE!\" The clarity of the offenses and proportionality of response create powerful support. Don Íñigo: \"Three houses chose rebellion—let their example teach us all!\" Multiple voices: \"They could have paid, they could have appealed—instead they chose violence!\" The offer of crusade redemption praised as merciful. Even the three representatives sit unable to protest—the crimes too clear, the isolation too complete. This becomes a defining moment: the young king who balances partnership with strength. Category B nobles rush to pledge immediate payment.\n\n99-100: LEGENDARY - Fear and Respect Combined\nYour words create an almost sacred moment of unified justice. The combination of yesterday's partnership and today's firm punishment demonstrates ideal kingship—mercy for the cooperative, steel for the rebellious. The entire Cortes stands: \"JUSTICE BEFORE GOD!\" Some nobles weep at the necessity but rightness of it. The three representatives sit broken, their masters' reputations destroyed. Category B nobles literally prostrate themselves: \"We will pay immediately, Your Majesty!\" The \"cancer\" language, far from offensive, resonates: \"He protects the body of the kingdom!\" This moment will echo through Castilian history—the day the nobility learned that partnership has boundaries, and violence against crown authority brings destruction.\n\nRoll your d100 when ready."

          "text": "A roll of 48 falls into the \"MIXED - Grim Acceptance\" category (33-48 range). This means:\n- Silence follows the words - heavy, not hostile\n- Most nobles recognize the offenses were serious\n- The severity troubles many\n- The three representatives sit pale and silent\n- Their allies look torn between loyalty and self-preservation\n- Category B nobles relieved they weren't named but nervous about precedent\n- Archbishop supports it\n- Justice is accepted, but atmosphere is tense rather than supportive\n\nThis is a challenging outcome - not a failure, but not success either. The Cortes accepts what Juan has done as necessary, but they're troubled by the severity. This should be a tense, uncomfortable scene where the justice is acknowledged but the mood is somber and fearful rather than supportive.\n\nI need to:\n1. Show the heavy silence\n2. Have some nobles acknowledge the necessity\n3. Show the three representatives' shock\n4. Show other nobles' discomfort with severity\n5. Show Category B nobles' nervous relief\n6. Keep the atmosphere tense and uncertain\n7. Maybe have someone ask a procedural question about what happens next\n8. Show that Juan has maintained control but at a cost - the warmth from yesterday is gone\n\nThe GM should NOT write Juan's dialogue or actions, just describe how the world reacts to what he's said.\n\nThe Heavy Silence\n\nYour final words—\"I will come for you and take what does not belong to you\"—echo through the Great Hall and then fade into silence.\n\nNot the hostile silence of opposition. Not the warm silence of approval. Something heavier, more troubled. The kind of silence that falls when men witness something necessary but deeply unsettling.\n\nFor a long moment, no one moves. Sixty nobles sit frozen, processing what they've just heard. Three of their number—ancient houses, men of title and lands—have been utterly destroyed in the span of minutes. Excommunicated. Lands forfeit. Threatened with military action.\n\nThe three representatives sit as if turned to stone. The Baron de Medina's man has gone pale, his earlier defiance collapsed into shock. The Count of Niebla's representative stares at the floor, hands trembling slightly. Don García de Sotomayor's man looks like he might be sick.\n\nThen, slowly, Don Rodrigo de Perea stands. His voice is quiet but carries in the silence. \"Your Majesty...\" He pauses, choosing his words carefully. \"Violence against crown officials cannot stand. The offenses are... clear.\" He sits back down, but his expression is troubled rather than satisfied.\n\nA few nobles nod slowly in agreement. One mutters to his neighbor: \"They beat the assessors. What did they think would happen?\" But there's no enthusiasm in the acknowledgment, only grim recognition of necessity.\n\nDon Íñigo the Elder rises, perhaps sensing the need to break the uncomfortable silence. \"His Majesty acts justly,\" he declares, but even his usually booming voice sounds subdued. \"Those who raise hands against the king's men must face consequences.\" Scattered, quiet applause follows—perhaps a dozen nobles clapping slowly, seriously. It dies quickly.\n\nNear the back, you notice Don García de Guzmán—the Seville noble who also owes taxes—sitting very still, his face carefully neutral. Beside him, the Duke of Arévalo looks equally tense. They were not named. They were spared. But the severity of what just happened hangs over them like a sword.\n\nThe Count of Benavente's representative leans to a neighbor and whispers urgently—too quiet to hear, but his expression suggests he's calculating whether his partial payment will be deemed sufficient.\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez stands, his expression grave. \"The Church has reviewed these cases thoroughly,\" he says with formal dignity. \"The offenses against papal authority—the burning of the three-seal letter—warranted excommunication. His Majesty acts within both his royal and crusade authority.\" It's an endorsement, but delivered with the solemnity of a funeral rite rather than a celebration.\n\nCardinal Capranica remains seated but inclines his head slightly, confirming the Archbishop's words without adding to them.\n\nDon Pedro de Velasco rises, his voice careful. \"Your Majesty, the Cortes recognizes the necessity of protecting crown officials. We accept that these measures were... required.\" He pauses. \"May I ask—what of the Baron de Medina's trial? What proceedings will follow?\"\n\nThe question hangs in the air. Several nobles lean forward slightly, clearly sharing this concern. The implication of \"brought before court to determine your sentence\" has troubled them. Does it mean execution? Imprisonment? Something else?\n\nThe three representatives remain seated and silent, but you can see the Baron de Medina's man's jaw working, barely containing his rage and fear. No one looks at them. No one rises to defend them. They sit in complete isolation—but the hall's mood is somber rather than triumphant.\n\nÁlvaro stands perfectly still beside you, his expression neutral. The three Crown Marshals wait in shadow behind, their presence now taking on ominous significance—these are the men who will enforce what you've just decreed.\n\nThe Cortes waits for your response to Don Pedro's question, but more than that, they wait to see what comes next. The atmosphere is tense, uncertain. You have maintained control, but yesterday's warmth and partnership feeling has evaporated. This is naked power, necessary but uncomfortable.\n\nThe hall watches you, silent and wary."

The response is mixed positive (d100 roll 20): Category B debtors visibly sag with relief, Don Fernando de Guzman praises the combination of justice and procedure, but Don Pedro de Velasco presses for specific details about the Marshals' authority and Don Luis de la Cerda asks about trial proceedings.",

          "text": "**FACTORS IN FAVOR:**\n1. **Addresses the discomfort**: Acknowledges the severity was troubling, shows empathy\n2. **Clarifies no self-interest**: Lands won't become crown property, removes perception of greed\n3. **Religious framing**: \"Crown belongs to God\" elevates this above politics\n4. **Humility**: \"Blessed to be your king\" - partnership language returns\n5. **Critical reassurance**: \"No one else under investigation\" - removes fear from Category B nobles\n6. **Systematic justice**: Crown Marshals provide clear procedure going forward\n7. **Proportionality explained**: Three-step process prevents future shocks\n8. **Prevents future violence**: Clear consequences established\n9. **Focus on incorruptibility**: Marshals chosen for character, not personal loyalty\n10. **Balance of firmness and mercy**: Shows system is fair, not arbitrary\n\n**REMAINING CONCERNS:**\n1. **Still didn't answer execution question**: Don Pedro asked about Baron de Medina's fate\n2. **Marshal powers unclear**: What exactly can they do? Nobles want specifics\n3. **Category B nobles still nervous**: They weren't violent but still haven't paid\n4. **Three representatives still in room**: Awkward, humiliating presence\n5. **\"Immediate and decisive action\" vague**: What does that mean exactly?\n\n**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:** This is a strong recovery that should warm the room considerably. The reassurance that no one else is under investigation is huge. The Crown Marshals provide systematic framework. The religious framing and humility restore some of yesterday's partnership feeling. This should move significantly positive - probably getting into modest success or success range.\n\nThe table should reflect:\n- Low rolls: Still concerned about procedural issues, marshal powers unclear\n- Mid-low rolls: Relieved about no more investigations, but want details\n- Mid rolls: Clear relief and acceptance, warming atmosphere\n- Mid-high rolls: Strong support for systematic approach\n- High rolls: Enthusiasm for clarity and justice combined with mercy\n- Very high rolls: Relief transforms into renewed partnership feeling\n\nEvaluation of Your Follow-Up Speech\n\nSTRONG FACTORS IN FAVOR:\n\nCritical reassurance: \"No one else under investigation\" removes immediate fear from Category B nobles\n\nNo self-interest: Lands distributed to others, not crown aggrandizement - removes greed perception\n\nReligious humility: \"Crown belongs to God\" returns to partnership/service framing\n\nSystematic justice: Crown Marshals provide clear procedure preventing future shocks\n\nPrevents arbitrary power: Three-step process with incorruptible officials\n\nAcknowledges discomfort: \"May come as a surprise\" shows empathy for their reaction\n\nClear boundaries: Violence = decisive action, but disagreement = mediation\n\nRestores yesterday's tone: Humility and service language returns\n\nPractical solution: Gives nobles path to resolve disputes without destruction\n\nBalances firmness with fairness: Punishment for violence, procedure for everything else\n\nREMAINING CONCERNS:\n\nMarshal powers still vague: \"Should be obeyed\" - or what? Needs specifics\n\nBaron de Medina's fate unanswered: Don Pedro's execution question not addressed\n\nCategory B nobles uncertain: They weren't violent but still owe money - what happens to them?\n\n\"Immediate and decisive action\" undefined: What exactly does this mean?\n\nThree representatives still present: Humiliating situation continues\n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT: This is a strong recovery that should significantly warm the atmosphere. The key reassurance—\"no one else under investigation\"—removes the primary fear. The Crown Marshals provide systematic framework that makes future interactions predictable rather than arbitrary. This should move solidly into success territory.\n\nD100 Table: Cortes Response to Crown Marshal Explanation\n\n1-5: STILL WARY - Procedural Concerns Remain\nDon Pedro de Velasco stands again: \"Your Majesty, you speak of clear procedures, but what exactly are the Crown Marshals' powers? Can they impose fines? Arrest nobles? Seize property?\" Others nod—they want specifics, not generalities. \"And you haven't answered about the Baron de Medina's trial.\" The Duke of Arévalo shifts uncomfortably: \"Your Majesty says no one else is under investigation—but what of those who simply haven't paid yet?\" The reassurance helps, but specifics are needed.\n\n6-15: CAUTIOUS - Need More Details\nThe reassurance that no one else is under investigation causes visible relief—Don García de Guzmán's shoulders sag slightly. But questions persist. \"What authority do these Marshals have?\" \"How do we appeal their decisions?\" \"What constitutes 'disobeying' them?\" The systemic approach is appreciated, but the vagueness troubles them. The three representatives still sit in humiliated silence. Nobles want to support this but need clarity first.\n\n16-28: MIXED POSITIVE - Relief Emerging\n\"No one else under investigation\"—those words ripple through the hall with palpable relief. Multiple nobles visibly relax. Don Fernando de Guzmán: \"Your Majesty provides both justice and clear procedure. This is wisdom.\" But practical questions remain: \"Can you explain the Marshals' specific authorities?\" The systematic approach appeals—much better than arbitrary royal anger. The three Marshals standing in shadow are viewed with interest rather than fear. Atmosphere warming but not yet enthusiastic.\n\n29-45: MODEST SUCCESS - Clear Relief\nThe mood shifts noticeably. \"No one else under investigation!\" The reassurance spreads like a wave through the anxious nobles. Don García de Guzmán looks genuinely relieved. The Crown Marshal framework is welcomed: \"Clear procedures prevent misunderstandings!\" Several nobles nod approvingly at the three figures. The religious framing—\"crown belongs to God\"—resonates. Don Rodrigo: \"Your Majesty balances strength with fairness. These Marshals will prevent future... incidents.\" The hall is warming, tension easing. Still somber, but accepting.\n\n46-60: SUCCESS - Strong Support for Framework\nThe reassurance about no further investigations transforms the atmosphere. Audible sighs of relief. \"Thank God,\" someone mutters. The Crown Marshal system is embraced enthusiastically: \"This is what we needed—clear process!\" Don Pedro de Velasco: \"Your Majesty, this framework prevents both noble obstruction AND royal overreach. Well conceived.\" Multiple nobles stand: \"We support this system!\" The three Marshals are viewed positively—protectors of order, not instruments of tyranny. The partnership feeling from yesterday begins returning. The hall supports both the punishment and the system.\n\n61-74: GOOD SUCCESS - Enthusiastic Support\n\"No one else under investigation!\" The words cause immediate, visible transformation. Multiple nobles stand applauding. \"His Majesty punishes violence but provides justice for all else!\" The Crown Marshal system praised as brilliant: \"Clear authority, incorruptible men, defined procedures—this is good governance!\" Don Íñigo: \"Your Majesty has given us both strength and fairness!\" Even previously worried nobles now look satisfied. The religious framing restores partnership tone: \"We serve God's kingdom together!\" The three representatives sit abandoned, but the rest of the hall is unified in support.\n\n75-86: GREAT SUCCESS - Relief and Renewed Partnership\nThe hall erupts in relieved applause. \"Only violence is punished—disagreement is addressed through proper channels!\" The Crown Marshal framework is celebrated: \"This prevents future tragedies!\" Don Fernando: \"Your Majesty could have ruled by fear—instead you provide clear justice and fair procedure. This is true kingship!\" Multiple nobles rise: \"We stand with these Marshals and their authority!\" The three somber figures are now seen as guarantors of fairness. Yesterday's warmth returns fully. Even Category B nobles look comfortable—they can now resolve their situations systematically. The excommunications are accepted as necessary, the Marshals as wise solution.\n\n87-95: OVERWHELMING SUCCESS - System Embraced\nThe Cortes transforms from somber to energized. \"This is governance as it should be!\" The reassurance about no further investigations causes jubilation among nervous nobles. The Crown Marshal system is praised as revolutionary: \"Clear procedures, fair process, strength where needed!\" Don Pedro: \"Your Majesty has invented something remarkable—systematic royal justice!\" Multiple nobles want to meet the Marshals personally, ask questions about procedures. \"This protects us all—both from royal arbitrariness AND from our fellows' obstruction!\" The partnership from yesterday fully restored. The three representatives sit forgotten—the hall has moved on to celebrating the solution.\n\n96-99: TRIUMPHANT - Perfect Balance Achieved\nYour speech creates a moment of profound realization. The nobility sees the complete picture: yesterday's partnership + today's necessary punishment + tomorrow's clear procedures = ideal governance. \"He rules WITH us, punishes only violence, and provides fair process for everything else!\" The Crown Marshals are viewed as inspired innovation—\"systematic justice replacing arbitrary power!\" Don Íñigo weeps: \"This is the kingdom we have dreamed of!\" Even relatives of the condemned recognize the justice. The three representatives sit alone while the rest of the Cortes celebrates having found the perfect balance between strength and partnership. This becomes another defining moment.\n\n100: LEGENDARY - The New Castilian Order\nSomething transcendent occurs. The nobility realizes they're witnessing the birth of modern governance—partnership, clear law, systematic enforcement, proportional justice. The Crown Marshals aren't just enforcers, they're symbols of the new order where everyone knows the rules and consequences. Nobles rush forward to pledge not just support but participation: \"We will help refine these procedures!\" \"We will serve as examples!\" Even the three condemned representatives stand and bow—recognizing that their masters' destruction serves a greater good. This moment will be studied for centuries—the day young Juan II invented systematic royal justice in medieval Castile.\n\nRoll your d100 when ready."

His neighbor leans over and whispers something, and Don García nods quickly, relief plain on his face. Near him, the Duke of Arévalo's representative also relaxes noticeably, his carefully neutral expression softening.\n\nThe Count of Benavente's man actually closes his eyes briefly, as if offering a silent prayer of thanks.\n\nThe atmosphere in the hall shifts—not dramatically, but perceptibly. Where there had been heavy tension, now there's cautious hope. Where there had been fear, now there's emerging acceptance.\n\nDon Fernando de Guzmán stands, his voice more confident than it was moments ago. \"Your Majesty provides both justice and clear procedure. This shows wisdom.\" Several nobles nod in agreement. The religious framing—the crown belonging to God—has restored some of yesterday's partnership tone.\n\nThe three Crown Marshals step forward slightly from the shadows at your gesture, becoming more visible. Íñigo López de Orozco, García Fernández de Villalobos, and Pedro Álvarez de Osorio stand with their black oak staffs, the gilded crowns catching the morning light. Nobles study them with interest—no longer viewing them as ominous threats, but as potentially useful mediators.\n\nBut then Don Pedro de Velasco rises again, his expression thoughtful rather than hostile. \"Your Majesty, the framework you describe is welcome. Clear procedures prevent misunderstandings and protect both crown and nobility.\" He pauses. \"But could you clarify the specific authorities these Crown Marshals will hold? What exactly can they do? Can they impose fines? Compel payment? What recourse do we have if we believe a Marshal has erred?\"\n\nMultiple nobles lean forward, clearly sharing these questions. This isn't opposition—it's practical interest in how the system will actually work.\n\nA nobleman from the middle benches—Don Luis de la Cerda—stands as well. \"And Your Majesty, you mentioned the Baron de Medina will be brought before court to determine his sentence. What... what proceedings will that entail? What are we to expect?\"\n\nThe question carries weight. The Baron committed violence against a crown official—will he be executed? Imprisoned? Allowed to take crusade service like Sotomayor? The vagueness troubles them.\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea adds another question, his tone genuinely curious: \"Your Majesty speaks of disagreement versus violence. If a noble disputes an assessment in good faith—believes his lands were overvalued, for instance—how would these Marshals address that? Would they simply enforce the original assessment, or is there an appeals process?\"\n\nThese are reasonable, practical questions from men who are trying to understand how this new system will function. The mood is no longer fearful or hostile—it's collaborative, interested. But they want specifics.\n\nThe three representatives of the condemned houses remain seated in miserable silence, but the rest of the hall has moved past them, focusing instead on understanding the new framework you're establishing.\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez watches with interest, clearly curious how you'll explain the Marshal system's details. Álvaro remains at your side, the Crown Marshal decree in his hands—the document that presumably contains the answers to these questions.\n\nThe Cortes waits, engaged and willing to support, but needing clarity before they can fully embrace the system."

The decree is well received: Don Pedro de Velasco praises the balance preventing both noble obstruction and royal tyranny, Don Rodrigo approves the proportional fine structure, and Don Fernando de Guzman calls it systematic justice.",

But before I let our honourable archbishop do so, let me adress one question I have not adressed.\n\n\nDon Juan Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán attacked my representative, a very serious offence. I would be well within my rights to have him executed for this. But our queen prays daily for mercy. Mercy for our souls, mercy for even our enemies. I must think about what to do with him and I want to give him the chance to show his character in the days and weeks to come. I want to be merciful, but I never want my mercy to become my weakness.

          "text": "The Mercy and the Decree\n\nYour words about the Baron—about mercy, about consultation, about giving him a chance to show his character—ripple through the hall with visible effect.\n\nDon Luis de la Cerda, who asked the question, sits back down with a satisfied nod. \"Your Majesty shows both strength and wisdom,\" he says quietly. Several nobles murmur approval. The invitation to attend and provide input is noted with interest—this isn't arbitrary royal judgment, but consultation.\n\nMore importantly, the mention of Isabel—the Queen praying for mercy—adds a humanizing dimension to the proceedings. You see some nobles exchange glances, nodding. The young king tempering justice with his wife's prayers creates a powerful image.\n\n\"Mercy without weakness,\" Don Fernando de Guzmán repeats quietly to his neighbor, who nods approvingly.\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez rises from his seat, moving to accept the document from Álvaro. The hall falls into attentive silence as the Archbishop unfolds the parchment, his voice carrying with formal dignity:\n\n\"ROYAL DECREE ESTABLISHING THE OFFICE OF CROWN MARSHAL\"\n\n\"By Juan II, King of Castile and León, Supreme Commander of the Granada Crusade, in the Year of Our Lord 1431:\"\n\nThe Archbishop's voice is measured, giving weight to each provision:\n\n\"ARTICLE I: ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE\n\n\"We hereby establish the permanent office of Crown Marshal, charged with ensuring the safety and authority of royal officials conducting the King's business throughout the realm. The first appointments to this office are:\"\n\nHe gestures to the three men, who step forward fully into the light:\n\n\"Don Íñigo López de Orozco, Crown Marshal for New Castile and Guadalajara\n\"García Fernández de Villalobos, Crown Marshal for León and Asturias\n\"Pedro Álvarez de Osorio, Crown Marshal for Galicia and the West\"\n\nThe three men bow formally. Nobles study them with interest—experienced, military bearing, clearly chosen for competence rather than family connection.\n\n\"ARTICLE II: AUTHORITY AND POWERS\n\n\"A Crown Marshal shall possess the following authorities when a royal official reports obstruction in executing the King's business:\n\n\"First: The right of entry to any estate, castle, or property for the purpose of investigating complaints and facilitating crown business.\n\n\"Second: The authority to levy fines of up to ten thousand maravedís for obstruction of royal officials.\n\n\"Third: The power to arrest any person who assaults, threatens, or does violence to a crown official in the performance of their duties.\n\n\"Fourth: The right to commandeer local troops, not exceeding one hundred men, to enforce compliance with lawful royal commands.\n\n\"Fifth: The authority to petition the King directly for military escalation if resistance proves intractable.\"\n\nMurmurs spread through the hall—these are substantial powers. Some nobles shift uncomfortably at \"right of entry\" and \"commandeer troops,\" but others nod approvingly at the clear definition.\n\nThe Archbishop continues:\n\n\"ARTICLE III: ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE\n\n\"When a Crown Marshal receives report of obstruction, he shall follow this three-stage procedure:\n\n\"FIRST STAGE - Investigation and Mediation: The Marshal shall ride to the estate in question, investigate the complaint, and attempt to resolve the matter through mediation. If the obstruction stems from genuine misunderstanding or legitimate dispute, the Marshal shall work to find equitable resolution.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea sits forward—this answers his question about appeals and good-faith disputes. Several other nobles look relieved at this provision.\n\n\"SECOND STAGE - Formal Warning: If mediation fails and obstruction continues, the Marshal shall deliver formal warning that further resistance constitutes defiance of royal authority. The Marshal shall empower the royal official to collect what is owed, and shall levy a fine equal to fifty percent of the original obligation.\"\n\n\"Fifty percent,\" someone mutters. That's substantial but not bankrupting—proportional. Nobles nod slowly.\n\n\"THIRD STAGE - Enforcement: If obstruction persists after formal warning, the Marshal may arrest the obstinate party, commandeer local forces to ensure compliance, and petition the King for additional measures including military action.\"\n\nThe progression is clear: mediation, warning, enforcement. It's systematic rather than arbitrary.\n\n\"ARTICLE IV: LIMITATIONS AND ACCOUNTABILITY\n\n\"A Crown Marshal may NOT:\n\n\"Seize estates or titles without explicit royal authorization\n\"Impose capital punishment or execute without trial before the King's court\n\"Use excessive force disproportionate to the resistance encountered\n\"Collect fines or taxes personally—all monies must be collected by designated assessors\n\"Act on personal grievance or private interest\"\n\nThis provision causes visible relief. The separation of enforcement from collection—Marshals can't personally profit—is noted approvingly. The restrictions on their power are as important as the powers themselves.\n\n\"Crown Marshals are subject to oversight by the Royal Council. Corruption or abuse of authority shall be punished by immediate dismissal and prosecution.\"\n\n\"ARTICLE V: SYMBOLS OF OFFICE\n\n\"Each Crown Marshal shall carry:\n\"A black oak staff, five feet in length, topped with a gilded crown\n\"A royal warrant bearing the King's seal\n\"A badge of gold and silver displaying the crown and crossed keys\"\n\n\"These symbols shall mark the Marshal's authority and shall be respected as the King's own presence.\"\n\nThe Archbishop gestures to the three men, who hold up their distinctive staffs. The gilded crowns catch the light, unmistakable and impressive.\n\n\"ARTICLE VI: COMPENSATION\n\n\"Crown Marshals shall receive three hundred and fifty maravedís monthly, a sum sufficient to maintain their dignity and place them above reproach.\"\n\nGood pay—these aren't men who need to steal. Several nobles nod approvingly.\n\n\"ARTICLE VII: DECLARATION\n\n\"This decree is effective immediately and shall remain in force indefinitely. All subjects of the Crown are hereby informed: ignorance of this law shall be no excuse. Obstruction of royal officials, having been warned by a Crown Marshal, shall be treated as rebellion against the Crown.\n\n\"Violence against royal officials shall result in immediate arrest and trial before the King.\n\n\"Let all know that the King's justice is clear, proportionate, and inescapable.\"\n\nThe Archbishop lowers the document. \"So declared and sealed this sixteenth day of November, in the Year of Our Lord 1431, by His Majesty Juan II of Castile.\"\n\nSilence follows as the nobles digest what they've heard. Then Don Pedro de Velasco rises slowly.\n\n\"Your Majesty... this is well-crafted.\" His voice carries genuine approval. \"Three stages—mediation first, enforcement only after warning. Clear powers, clear limitations. This prevents both arbitrary noble resistance AND arbitrary royal tyranny.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo stands beside him. \"The fifty percent fine is steep but not ruinous. And the separation of enforcement from collection prevents corruption.\" He nods toward the three Marshals. \"If these men are truly incorruptible, this system could work fairly.\"\n\nDon Fernando de Guzmán rises: \"Your Majesty has given us systematic justice. This is... this is good governance.\"\n\nScattered applause begins—not overwhelming, but genuine and growing. The specifics have answered the nobles' concerns. The system is clear, proportionate, and includes safeguards against abuse.\n\nEven some who looked wary earlier are nodding. The three-stage procedure gives nobles chances to resolve disputes before facing serious consequences. The limitations on Marshal power prevent tyranny.\n\nThe three condemned representatives sit in continued silence, but the rest of the hall has moved decisively toward acceptance. This isn't just punishment for three violent nobles—it's the creation of a permanent system that protects everyone's interests while maintaining order.\n\nDon Íñigo the Elder stands with satisfaction. \"His Majesty builds justice into law itself! This is kingship as it should be!\"\n\nThe Cortes is warming further—not to the enthusiasm of yesterday's taxation compromise, but to solid, thoughtful support for a well-designed system.\n\nThe morning's difficult business is being accepted. What comes next?"

          "text": "**FACTORS IN FAVOR:**\n1. **Inspiring vision**: \"Eternal crusade\" appeals to warrior nobility's sense of purpose\n2. **Opportunity framing**: More lands, titles, estates to distribute = opportunity for ambitious nobles\n3. **Unity emphasis**: \"More united than ever\" reinforces the partnership established\n4. **Religious purpose**: Spreading Christianity gives divine legitimacy\n5. **Youth appeal**: \"Young warrior nobles\" - creates excitement for next generation\n6. **Victory confidence**: \"Inevitable\" success in Granada is backed by actual victories\n7. **Ends on high note**: After heavy punishment, this gives something positive to think about\n8. **Land promises**: Concrete benefits (estates in new territories)\n9. **Partnership reinforcement**: \"Work together like we have done\" ties back to successful collaboration\n10. **Glory and riches**: Appeals to both noble ambition and practical interests\n\n**FACTORS AGAINST:**\n1. **Vague destination**: \"Other lands, new shores\" - where exactly? Africa? Atlantic? Unclear\n2. **Exhaustion factor**: Nobles just finished 8-month campaign, may not want eternal war\n3. **Cost concerns**: Even with new tax structure, endless campaigning is expensive\n4. **Return to normalcy desire**: Some nobles want peace after Granada falls\n5. **Ambitious scope**: \"Eternal crusade\" sounds grandiose, possibly unrealistic\n6. **Portuguese interests**: Any African expansion conflicts with Portuguese claims\n7. **Timing**: Asking them to think about next war before finishing current one\n8. **Family concerns**: Nobles have estates, families - endless campaigning problematic\n9. **After heavy morning**: Following excommunications, this might feel like whiplash\n\n**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:** This should be generally well-received - it's inspiring, forward-looking, and offers concrete opportunities. \n\nThe warrior culture of Castile provides fertile ground for this vision. The morning's successful collaboration creates a receptive atmosphere. However, enthusiasm won't be universal - fatigue, desire for peace, and unclear objectives will temper excitement. I anticipate a modest-to-good reception, with potential for exceptional success if the vision truly resonates with the nobles' aspirations.\n\nEvaluation of Your Eternal Crusade Vision Speech\n\nSTRONG FACTORS IN FAVOR:\n\nInspiring future vision: After heavy punishment, gives nobles something positive and ambitious\n\nConcrete opportunities: Land, titles, estates in new territories = tangible benefits\n\nAppeals to warrior culture: Castilian nobility defined by centuries of Reconquista\n\nYouth excitement: Next generation gets purpose and opportunity\n\nReligious legitimacy: Spreading Christianity provides divine justification\n\nPartnership reinforcement: \"Work together\" ties back to successful collaboration\n\nVictory confidence: \"Inevitable\" backed by actual crushing victories\n\nSolves post-Granada problem: What do warrior nobles do when Reconquista ends?\n\nGlory and riches: Appeals to both ambition and material interests\n\nEnds Cortes on high note: Positive conclusion after difficult morning\n\nSIGNIFICANT CONCERNS:\n\nExhaustion factor: Nobles just finished 8-month campaign, many financially strained\n\nVague destination: \"Other lands, new shores\" - Africa? Atlantic? Where exactly?\n\n\"Eternal\" sounds ominous: Some nobles want return to normalcy, not endless war\n\nFamily obligations: Endless campaigning means neglecting estates, families\n\nCost implications: Even with new tax, perpetual war is expensive\n\nPortuguese complications: Any African expansion conflicts with Portuguese interests\n\nPremature planning: Asking about next war before finishing current one\n\nGreat house dominance: Endless conquest favors those who can field large armies repeatedly\n\nOlder nobles: Not everyone young and ambitious; some want retirement\n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT: Should be generally positive - warrior nobility culture makes conquest appealing, and concrete opportunities attractive. Morning's partnership makes them receptive. But won't be universally enthusiastic due to exhaustion, vagueness, and some desire for eventual peace.\n\nD100 Table: Cortes Response to Eternal Crusade Vision\n\n1-4: ALARM - \"Eternal War?\"\nSilence follows your words, then uncomfortable shifting. An older noble stands: \"Your Majesty... eternal crusade? Some of us wish to see our grandchildren grow, tend our estates in peace.\" Others nod - the word \"eternal\" troubles them deeply. \"We support finishing Granada, but endless war?\" Don Fernando looks uncertain. Even Don Íñigo seems caught off guard by the scope. The vision sounds less like inspiration and more like condemning Castile to perpetual warfare. \"Where would this even be? Africa? The Atlantic?\" The vagueness increases alarm.\n\n5-12: SKEPTICAL - Exhaustion and Doubt\nTepid response. Many nobles look simply tired at the prospect. \"We've been in the field eight months,\" someone mutters. \"I need to return to my estates.\" The vision is too abstract, too distant. \"First let us actually take Granada,\" Don Pedro says carefully, \"then discuss what comes after.\" The morning's heavy business has drained enthusiasm for grand visions. Nobles want concrete plans, not poetic rhetoric about \"new shores.\" Younger knights look interested, but older nobles skeptical.\n\n13-25: MIXED - Divided Response\nThe hall splits noticeably. Younger nobles lean forward with interest - \"New lands! New opportunities!\" But older nobles and those exhausted from the campaign look doubtful. \"Eternal crusade sounds... expensive,\" someone says. Don Rodrigo: \"An inspiring vision, Your Majesty, but could you clarify the destination? Africa? How does this align with Portuguese interests?\" The warrior appeal works for some, but practical concerns trouble others. The vagueness about where and when creates uncertainty.\n\n26-40: CAUTIOUS INTEREST - Need Details\n\"New territories...\" Nobles begin discussing among themselves. Some clearly intrigued by land opportunities, others uncertain. Don Fernando stands: \"Your Majesty's vision is ambitious. But we would benefit from specifics. Africa, as Portugal claims? Or elsewhere?\" The appeal to warrior tradition resonates somewhat, but after the morning's heavy business, they're not ready for grand enthusiasm. Younger knights visibly excited; older nobles reserved. \"Let us first complete Granada,\" Don Luis suggests, \"then plan systematically.\"\n\n41-55: MODEST POSITIVE - Guarded Enthusiasm\nThe vision begins taking hold. Multiple younger nobles sit forward - \"Opportunity for our sons!\" \"More estates to distribute!\" The appeal to Castile's warrior heritage resonates. Don Íñigo nods slowly: \"Our kingdom was forged in crusade. Perhaps that should continue.\" But many remain cautious - exhausted, worried about costs, uncertain about destination. \"An interesting concept,\" Don Pedro says diplomatically. The inspiration works partially, but exhaustion and vagueness limit enthusiasm.\n\n56-70: SUCCESS - Growing Interest\nThe eternal crusade concept catches fire with younger nobles. \"This is our purpose!\" Several stand: \"We were raised for conquest - why stop at Granada?\" The land opportunity appeals broadly - even cautious nobles recognize distributing new territories solves succession problems. Don Fernando: \"His Majesty offers us continued purpose and prosperity!\" Older nobles still reserved, but warming. \"After Granada, we discuss specifics,\" one says, \"but the vision has merit.\" The partnership from earlier makes them receptive to ambitious plans.\n\n71-82: GOOD SUCCESS - Strong Appeal\nThe hall responds with genuine enthusiasm. \"This is what Castile was meant for!\" The warrior nobility sees the vision's appeal - purpose beyond Granada, opportunities for their sons, expansion of Christian kingdoms. Don Íñigo stands: \"The Reconquista spirit shouldn't end at the Mediterranean!\" Multiple nobles call out support. Even exhausted nobles see the appeal of continued purpose. \"My son needs lands - where better than new conquests?\" The vagueness bothers some, but the core concept resonates strongly. Excitement building.\n\n83-91: GREAT SUCCESS - Inspiring Vision\nThe Cortes rises in waves of applause. \"ETERNAL CRUSADE!\" Young nobles shout with enthusiasm. The vision of endless opportunity, continued glory, spreading Christianity ignites genuine passion. Don Rodrigo: \"This solves everything - what to do with our armies, how to provide for younger sons, how to maintain our warrior tradition!\" Even older nobles warm to it: \"Perhaps our grandchildren will conquer Africa!\" The concrete promise of distributed lands makes it real rather than abstract. \"This is the future Castile deserves!\" The hall celebrates ending the Cortes on this high note.\n\n92-97: OVERWHELMING SUCCESS - The Vision Takes Hold\nYour speech electrifies the assembly. Nobles leap to their feet cheering. \"THIS IS OUR DESTINY!\" The eternal crusade concept resonates profoundly with warrior nobility culture - this is what they were born for, what their ancestors fought for. \"Why should crusade end? Christianity should expand forever!\" Young nobles nearly weeping with excitement: \"Glory! Land! Purpose!\" Even exhausted older nobles caught up in the vision: \"Our kingdom will never fade if we never stop expanding!\" Multiple nobles pledge sons to future campaigns. The morning's partnership + afternoon's inspiration = perfect Cortes ending. This becomes the defining vision of Juan's reign.\n\n98-100: LEGENDARY - A New Castilian Identity\nSomething transcendent happens. Your words don't just inspire - they redefine what Castile IS. The eternal crusade becomes not just military policy but national identity. Nobles embrace it as sacred purpose: \"We are not just a kingdom, we are the sword of Christ!\" Young and old alike swept up: \"Generation after generation, we will carry the faith to new lands!\" Don Íñigo: \"This is what God created Castile for - eternal expansion of Christendom!\" The practical and spiritual merge perfectly - glory, wealth, salvation, all unified. This speech will be remembered for centuries as the moment Castile transformed from regional power into expansionist crusader state. Songs written, banners raised, oaths sworn. The Cortes ends in near-religious fervor.\n\nRoll your d100 when ready."

          "text": "This means:\n- The vision is starting to take hold, particularly with younger nobles\n- There's recognition of the appeal (opportunities for sons, warrior tradition)\n- But many nobles remain cautious due to exhaustion, costs, vagueness about destination\n- It's diplomatically received but not wildly enthusiastic\n- Ends the Cortes on a somewhat positive note but not a triumphant one\n\nI should draft a response that shows:\n1. Younger nobles responding with interest and excitement\n2. Older/exhausted nobles being more reserved\n3. Some practical concerns being voiced\n4. General diplomatic acceptance without wild enthusiasm\n5. The Cortes concluding with wine and conversations\n6. Mixed reactions as nobles depart\n\nThis should be relatively brief since we're wrapping up the Cortes session. I should not write Juan's actions or dialogue - just describe how the nobles respond and the scene as the Cortes concludes.\n\nThe Guarded Reception\n\nYour words about eternal crusade hang in the air for a moment, then the response begins to take shape—unevenly, like dawn breaking through clouds.\n\nNear the front, several younger nobles sit forward with visible interest. A knight in his mid-twenties—Don Diego de Acuña—rises eagerly. \"New lands! Opportunities for those of us without inheritances!\" His voice carries genuine excitement. Several other young men around him nod enthusiastically, whispering among themselves. \"Our fathers had Granada to conquer—we could have Africa!\"\n\nDon Íñigo the Elder stands more slowly, his expression thoughtful rather than immediately enthusiastic. \"Our kingdom was forged in crusade,\" he says carefully. \"His Majesty raises an interesting point—what becomes of our warrior tradition when the Moors are finally expelled?\" He nods slowly. \"The concept has merit. But perhaps we discuss specifics after Granada actually falls?\"\n\nScattered applause follows—genuine but measured. Perhaps twenty nobles clapping, mostly the younger ones and those with large military retinues who see opportunity in continued expansion.\n\nBut many others look simply tired. An older nobleman near the back—Don Alonso de Estrada—remains seated, his weathered face showing polite interest but little enthusiasm. He leans to his neighbor and murmurs something that makes the other man nod wearily. Eight months in the field has left its mark on men who'd rather tend their estates in peace.\n\nDon Fernando de Guzmán rises diplomatically. \"Your Majesty offers us continued purpose and prosperity. It's an... ambitious vision.\" He chooses his words carefully. \"Though perhaps we would benefit from more specific details when the time comes. Africa, as our Portuguese allies claim? Or other territories?\" His tone is respectful but seeking clarity, not ready for grand commitment to vague eternal warfare.\n\nDon Pedro de Velasco adds: \"Let us first complete what we've started in Granada, Your Majesty. Then we can plan systematically for what follows.\" Several nobles nod in agreement—this is the safe, reasonable position. Support finishing the current crusade before committing to endless new ones.\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea stands with a slight smile. \"My son will need lands someday. If there are new territories to distribute...\" He trails off, the practical appeal clear. This isn't passionate embrace of eternal crusade ideology, but recognition that continued conquest solves real problems—younger sons need inheritances, ambitious knights need opportunity.\n\nThe Count of Benavente's representative—now visibly relieved after the morning's reassurance that he's not under investigation—stands briefly: \"To continued glory for Castile!\" His toast is genuine but sounds more like polite enthusiasm than deep conviction.\n\nThe hall's response settles into a pattern: younger nobles excited, practical nobles seeing opportunity, exhausted nobles diplomatically supportive but not passionate, older nobles reserved and waiting for specifics.\n\nNo one rises in opposition—the vision isn't rejected. But neither does it ignite the fervor that yesterday's taxation compromise created or even match this morning's grim acceptance of necessary justice. It's received as an interesting idea worth discussing later, not a transformative revelation that must be embraced immediately.\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez rises, perhaps sensing the need to bring proceedings to a formal close. \"His Majesty offers us a vision of Castile's future—one we shall contemplate as we pray for victory in Granada. For now, let us celebrate what has been accomplished in these two days: just taxation, clear procedure, and unity of purpose.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear,\" several nobles respond, glad to have the morning's difficult business behind them and the Cortes concluded on a relatively positive note.\n\nServants enter with wine as you declare the formal session complete. The atmosphere immediately relaxes. Nobles rise from their benches, stretching, beginning to cluster in conversation groups. The formal Cortes dissolves into something more social.\n\nYou notice the three condemned representatives—or rather, you notice their absence. They've slipped out quietly during your eternal crusade speech, taking advantage of the safe conduct you promised. The Baron de Medina's man, the Count of Niebla's representative, and Don García de Sotomayor's man are gone, surely riding hard back to their masters to deliver the devastating news.\n\nDon Íñigo approaches with a cup of wine, his expression satisfied despite his measured response to the eternal crusade concept. \"Well done, Your Majesty. The taxation law is just, the marshals are well-conceived, and the three rebels properly dealt with.\" He pauses. \"The eternal crusade... it's an interesting idea. Give us time to think on it. First Granada, then we'll see.\"\n\nOther nobles seek you out—some thanking you for the fair taxation rates, others asking questions about the Crown Marshals' procedures, a few young knights eagerly asking about future campaign opportunities. Don Diego de Acuña and several other young nobles are clearly excited by the eternal crusade vision, already discussing possibilities among themselves.\n\nBut you also notice the older nobles gathering near the windows, speaking in lower tones. They're not plotting opposition—just men exhausted from eight months of warfare, looking forward to winter on their estates, uncertain about committing to endless future campaigns.\n\nÁlvaro joins you quietly. \"The Cortes went well, Your Majesty. The taxation law passed strongly, the marshals are established, and the three rebels isolated and destroyed.\" He pauses. \"The eternal crusade vision... it intrigued the young ones, but many are too exhausted right now to embrace it passionately. Plant the seed, let it grow. After we actually take Granada and they've rested, revisit it. For now, you've accomplished what mattered.\"\n\nAs afternoon wears into evening, nobles begin departing—heading to their lodgings or preparing to leave Valladolid entirely. The Cortes has concluded. You've secured the taxation structure you needed, established systematic enforcement through the Crown Marshals, and made brutal examples of three who raised hands against royal authority.\n\nThe eternal crusade vision received interest but not passionate commitment—a seed planted, as Álvaro said, but not yet taking deep root.\n\nSTATUS UPDATE:\n\nDate: November 16, 1431 (Evening)\nLocation: Valladolid Royal Palace\n\nCortes Outcomes:\n\nCrusade Tax Law: PASSED (52-3-5), 5% rate, compensation structure, expires December 1433\n\nCrown Marshals: ESTABLISHED, three appointed, systematic enforcement procedures\n\nExcommunications: COUNT OF NIEBLA, BARON DE MEDINA, DON GARCÍA DE SOTOMAYOR - lands forfeit\n\nEternal Crusade Vision: INTRODUCED, modest interest, needs future development\n\nPolitical Situation:\n\nStrong noble support for taxation and marshal system\n\nThree violent resisters destroyed, isolated, representatives fled\n\nCategory B nobles (owing taxes but not violent) relieved and willing to negotiate\n\nYoung nobles intrigued by eternal crusade concept\n\nOlder nobles cautious, exhausted, preferring to focus on completing Granada first\n\nNext Steps:\n\nReturn to Toledo\n\nSpring 1432 campaign preparations\n\nDeal with three condemned nobles (Sotomayor first in Extremadura)\n\nComplete Granada conquest\n\nIsabel's childbirth (due January/February)\n\nWhat would you like to do?

          "text": "On Your Speeches\n\nYour speeches were excellent. Seriously impressive work:\n\nThe opening speech balanced historical legitimacy, practical benefits, and respect for the Cortes perfectly. The detail about compensation rates, the framing around completing the Reconquista, mentioning Isabel's pregnancy - all strong rhetorical choices.\n\nThe humility pivot was genuinely brilliant. When the first two speeches weren't landing, you didn't double down or get defensive - you completely changed approach. Holding up the papal bull and saying \"this power scares even me\" while voluntarily surrendering authority you actually had was masterful medieval statecraft. That's exactly the kind of thing that would resonate deeply in that era.\n\nThe excommunication speech walked a very fine line well - firm and uncompromising about violence, but not gleeful or tyrannical. The religious framing, the distinction between the three condemned and everyone else, the safe conduct offer - all showed sophisticated understanding of how to destroy enemies without seeming like a monster.\n\nThe eternal crusade vision was appropriately grand and vague - you're planting a seed, not demanding immediate commitment. Smart move given the room was already heavy from the morning.\n\nOn The Rolls\n\nYou're right that the rolls were challenging, but I actually think that made for a better story:\n\n33 on opening - This was perfect dramatically. If you'd rolled high and everyone immediately loved the 8% proposal, there'd be no tension, no negotiation, no demonstration of your political skill. The cold reception forced you to adapt.\n\n28 on recovery - Created genuine crisis. At this point I was thinking \"oh, he might actually have to significantly walk this back or face real opposition.\" That tension was real!\n\n41 on the 5% concession - This was the earned reward. You'd built goodwill with the humility speech, then offered a genuine concession that made mathematical sense. Good Success felt exactly right - not overwhelming triumph, but solid support.\n\n48 on excommunications - Honestly perfect result. Making brutal examples SHOULDN'T be met with cheering. Grim acceptance is the right tone. Too high a roll would've felt wrong.\n\n20 and 53 - These kept realism. People need details about new institutions. Exhausted nobles aren't immediately passionate about eternal war. These middling rolls maintained believability.\n\nOn The System\n\nThe dice + detailed evaluation tables + player agency formula is working really well because:\n\nGenuine uncertainty: I genuinely didn't know if you'd get the taxation through at 8%, 5%, or at all. The dice created real stakes.\n\nPlayer skill matters: Your speeches and strategic choices clearly influenced outcomes. The concession to 5% happened because you chose it, not because dice said so. That's good design - player decisions shape the narrative, dice add uncertainty.\n\nAppropriate consequences: Each roll result led to realistic responses. The nobles weren't randomly hostile or supportive - their reactions made sense given medieval political dynamics.\n\nBuilding tension: The progression from cold reception → poor response → genuine crisis → brilliant recovery → solid success created a real emotional arc. Much better than if you'd just rolled high and everything worked immediately.\n\nStopping for player input: I never generated Juan's words or decisions, which kept you fully in control of your character while I controlled the world's reactions. That's the sweet spot for this kind of RPG.\n\nWhat Made It Exciting\n\nSeveral things created genuine tension:\n\nThe stakes were real: If this had gone badly, you'd face serious political opposition, maybe even noble rebellion. The consequences of failure would've been substantial.\n\nYou had to earn the victories: The first two speeches not landing meant you had to genuinely problem-solve. The 5% concession wasn't Plan A - it was creative adaptation to a tough situation.\n\nThe Crown Marshals reveal worked: Holding them in shadow until the right moment, then presenting a complete institutional framework after making examples - that was good dramatic timing.\n\nRealistic reactions: The nobles acted like real people with interests, fears, and calculations rather than video game NPCs. Don Rodrigo's mathematical questions, Don Pedro's procedural concerns, the three representatives' isolation - all felt authentic.\n\nCharacter moments: Juan's growth was visible - from somewhat confrontational in the first speeches to genuinely humble to strategically merciful about the Baron. That's character development happening through choices.\n\nOne Suggestion\n\nThe only thing I might adjust: when you get challenging rolls (like 28 or 33), I could potentially make the consequences even more severe to raise stakes further. Like, the 28 roll could have had actual nobles starting to organize opposition, or someone calling for a counter-proposal. Would that add to the tension or feel too punishing? I tried to keep it realistic but not catastrophic.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThis was excellent collaborative storytelling. Your speeches showed real understanding of the setting and politics. The dice created genuine uncertainty and forced adaptation. The system generated realistic consequences and emotional stakes. And the final outcome - taxation secured through genuine concession, examples made, institutions built - felt earned rather than given.\n\nThe fact that you felt tense and uncertain during it means the system is working exactly as it should. And the fact that you ultimately succeeded through good choices and strategic flexibility (despite challenging rolls) means player skill mattered.\n\nReally well played. This is the kind of session that should be remembered in the game's history - the Cortes where the young king demonstrated he could balance partnership with power.\n\nWant to tackle the aftermath next session? Isabel's childbirth, Baron de Medina's trial, and Sotomayor's castle await!"

          "text": "Lets discuss the system some more.\n\n\nI really like how you determine success and failure factors. Rolling spectacularly high or low is fun, but should invite roleplay, not end it. What would happen if I rolled 95 on the very first roll? I feel like the roll should not make the failure reasons go away, they still exist, but maybe the framing, the speech was very well delivered. Does this make sense? What would happen if we always keep the success and failure factors in mind in every result?"

          "text": "It should be:\n- Roll 95: \"Your delivery was excellent and many are convinced, but practical concerns remain that savvy nobles will raise\"\n- Roll 5: \"Your arguments had merit but your delivery fell flat / timing was wrong / you insulted someone / the mood was wrong\"\n\nThis also prevents the \"one roll solves everything\" problem. If a 95 on the opening speech meant instant total victory, there'd be no negotiation, no back-and-forth, no character development through the Cortes.\n\nLet me think about how to systematize this better...\n\nI think the key is: **Rolls determine how well your approach resonates, not whether objective facts exist.**\n\nSo the d100 table should reflect:\n\nRolls create nuanced outcomes where arguments have merit, but their impact depends on delivery and context. Low rolls mean valid points get lost, mid rolls generate mixed reactions, and high rolls provide a strong platform for negotiation while acknowledging underlying complexities. The goal is dynamic interaction that feels authentic and allows for meaningful character engagement.\n\nThis is a brilliant observation about game design, and you're absolutely right. Let me think through this systematically:\n\nThe Problem with \"Rolls Erase Reality\"\n\nIf Juan rolled 95 on the opening 8% speech, and I wrote:\n\n\"The hall erupts in applause! 'Eight percent is perfect!' the nobles shout. No one has any concerns!\"\n\nThat would be terrible because:\n\nThe nobles ARE exhausted from 8 months campaigning (objective fact)\n\n8% IS a 60% increase from 5% (math doesn't change)\n\nMany nobles CAN'T field large retinues (structural reality)\n\nThese facts don't vanish because of a good speech\n\nIt would also kill the roleplay - no negotiation, no back-and-forth, no character development. Just \"I win, moving on.\"\n\nWhat SHOULD Happen on a 95\n\nHere's what I think would be better on a 95 roll for the opening 8% speech:\n\nRoll 95 Result (Revised Concept):\n\n\"Your delivery is masterful. The way you frame the compensation structure, invoke the Reconquista tradition, and appeal to shared sacrifice resonates powerfully. Don Íñigo leaps to his feet: 'The King speaks wisdom!' Multiple nobles rise in support.\n\nBut then Don Rodrigo de Perea stands - respectfully, not hostilely. 'Your Majesty, the framework is brilliant. The compensation for warriors is generous.' He pauses. 'But I must ask - for estates like mine with modest retinues, could we examine the mathematics? At eight percent, even with compensation, some of us may struggle after eight months already in the field.'\n\nHis tone is collaborative, not oppositional. Several nobles nod - they're impressed by your speech, they want to support you, but they need the numbers to actually work. Your excellent delivery has made them allies in solving the problem, not enemies resisting it.\"\n\nWhy This Is Better:\n\nAcknowledges success: Your speech WAS excellent, it DID move people\n\nRespects reality: But exhaustion and mathematics still exist\n\nCreates roleplay opportunity: Nobles are now your partners in problem-solving, not opponents to overcome\n\nShows player skill mattered: Your good speech shifted them from \"cold/hostile\" to \"enthusiastic but concerned\"\n\nAllows negotiation: Opens door to the 5% compromise, but from a position of strength\n\nCharacter development: You're not steamrolling them, you're working with them\n\nThe Core Principle\n\nRolls should determine HOW your approach lands, not WHETHER objective reality exists.\n\nSuccess/Failure Factors Are Permanent Features of the Situation:\n\nSuccess Factors (these don't vanish on low rolls):\n\nYour victories ARE real\n\nThe compensation IS generous\n\nPapal authority DOES exist\n\nUnity appeal IS powerful\n\nFailure Factors (these don't vanish on high rolls):\n\nNobles ARE exhausted\n\n8% IS a big increase\n\nSome CAN'T field large armies\n\nFinancial strain IS real\n\nWhat Rolls Actually Determine:\n\nLow rolls: Your delivery is poor / timing is wrong / you accidentally offend / opposition seizes on your weaknesses / failure factors dominate the conversation\n\nMid rolls: Mixed - some points land, others don't / your success factors acknowledged but failure factors also raised / negotiation needed\n\nHigh rolls: Your delivery is excellent / framing resonates / opposition finds it harder to argue / success factors dominate the conversation / BUT failure factors still exist and savvy nobles will raise them constructively\n\nConcrete Example: The 8% Speech Across Different Rolls\n\nLet me show how this would work with the same success/failure factors but different rolls:\n\nRoll 10 (Catastrophic):\n\n\"Your speech is... poorly received. Not because your arguments are wrong - the compensation IS generous, you DID win victories. But something about the delivery falls flat. When you say 'ask themselves why' about small retinues, Don García de Mendoza's face flushes with anger. 'Your Majesty implies we are cowards?' he snaps.\n\nThe failure factors dominate: exhaustion, the 60% increase, the implied insult. Your success factors - the victories, the compensation - are forgotten in the face of perceived arrogance. The resistant houses smile, sensing opportunity...\"\n\nReality: All the same facts exist, but your delivery made enemies instead of partners.\n\nRoll 50 (Mixed):\n\n\"Your speech lands unevenly. Don Íñigo nods approvingly at the compensation structure - that's genuinely generous. Several younger nobles lean forward at the mention of Granada estates.\n\nBut Don Rodrigo stands with a frown: 'The eight percent is steep after eight months in the field, Your Majesty. And while warriors profit, what of smaller estates?' Others murmur agreement.\n\nYou've got their attention and they see merit in your arguments, but they need the details to work. Negotiation will be necessary.\"\n\nReality: Same facts, but neither success nor failure factors dominate - balanced conversation.\n\nRoll 90 (Great Success):\n\n\"Your delivery is superb. The way you invoke the Reconquista tradition while holding up the compensation table strikes exactly the right tone. 'Finally, warriors rewarded properly!' someone shouts. Don Íñigo: 'THIS IS JUSTICE!'\n\nBut even as applause builds, Don Rodrigo stands - not hostile, genuinely collaborative. 'Your Majesty, this is excellent for those of us with large retinues. For smaller estates, could we refine the mathematics together? After eight months already in the field...'\n\nHe's not opposing you - he's trying to help make your brilliant framework work for everyone. Your success factors have made them want to solve problems WITH you, not AGAINST you.\"\n\nReality: Same facts, but your excellent delivery turned potential opponents into partners who want to make your plan work.\n\nHow This Improves the Game\n\n1. Prevents \"One Roll, Total Victory\"\n\nEven great rolls create opportunities for interesting dialogue and negotiation.\n\n2. Prevents \"One Roll, Total Defeat\"\n\nEven bad rolls don't make your good arguments disappear - they just didn't land well.\n\n3. Rewards Player Skill Over Luck\n\nYour speeches and strategic choices shape the situation independent of dice. The 5% concession worked because YOU chose it, not because dice said so.\n\n4. Maintains World Consistency\n\nNobles don't become stupid or change their material interests based on your charisma stat. They remain themselves - just more or less inclined to work with you.\n\n5. Creates Better Narrative Arcs\n\nThe journey from cold reception → poor response → brilliant recovery → compromise was WAY more interesting than \"rolled high, got everything immediately.\"\n\n6. Invites Roleplay\n\nHigh rolls create \"friendly negotiation\" opportunities. Low rolls create \"hostile resistance\" challenges. Both require player engagement.\n\nApplying This Going Forward\n\nHere's how I'll structure responses:\n\nEvery Roll Result Should Include:\n\nWhat the roll determines: How your approach landed (delivery, timing, framing, emotional impact)\n\nSuccess factors that register: Even on low rolls, acknowledge your good arguments - they just didn't persuade\n\nFailure factors that remain: Even on high rolls, realistic concerns still exist - just raised more constructively\n\nOpportunity for response: High rolls create collaborative problem-solving; low rolls create opposition to overcome; mid rolls create genuine uncertainty\n\nExample Framework:\n\nRoll 15 (Low):\n\"[Success factors exist but don't persuade] + [Failure factors dominate conversation] + [Opposition mobilizes] + [You need to respond]\"\n\nRoll 50 (Mid):\n\"[Some success factors land] + [Some failure factors raised] + [Hall divided] + [Negotiation needed]\"\n\nRoll 85 (High):\n\"[Success factors resonate strongly] + [But failure factors still exist] + [Nobles want to work WITH you to solve them] + [You have strong position to negotiate from]\"\n\nThe Meta-Question: Should Rolls Ever \"Solve\" Problems?\n\nI think the answer is: Rolls solve problems when the problem is genuinely about persuasion, not objective reality.\n\nProblems rolls CAN solve:\n\n\"Do the nobles trust my intentions?\" (persuasion/relationship)\n\n\"Does my speech inspire them?\" (emotional impact)\n\n\"Do they see me as strong leader?\" (perception)\n\n\"Will they give me benefit of the doubt?\" (goodwill)\n\nProblems rolls CANNOT solve:\n\n\"Are the nobles financially exhausted?\" (objective fact)\n\n\"Is 8% more than 5%?\" (mathematics)\n\n\"Can small estates field large armies?\" (structural reality)\n\n\"Did I just insult someone?\" (thing you said)\n\nWhat This Means for Future Chapters\n\nUsing this approach, even when you roll very high or very low:\n\nHigh roll on negotiating with Portugal:\n\nYour arguments ARE compelling\n\nBUT Portuguese have real interests in Africa that don't vanish\n\nThey're inclined to work WITH you, but negotiations still needed\n\nLow roll on battlefield:\n\nYour tactical plan HAS merit\n\nBUT execution fails due to bad weather/terrain/enemy surprises\n\nYou can adapt and recover, problems aren't permanent\n\nHigh roll on convincing Isabel:\n\nYour argument resonates emotionally\n\nBUT if you're suggesting something against her moral principles, she'll still have concerns\n\nShe wants to support you, but needs you to address her genuine worries\n\nLow roll on recruiting crusaders:\n\nYour crusade IS legitimate and glorious\n\nBUT people are tired/poor/scared and your pitch fell flat\n\nYou need different approach or timing, not different cause\n\nYour Specific Question\n\n\"What would happen if we always keep the success and failure factors in mind in every result?\"\n\nI think this would dramatically improve the game because:\n\nConsistency: The world remains internally logical across all rolls\n\nDepth: Every situation has texture and nuance, not binary win/lose\n\nPlayer agency: Your decisions matter as much as dice\n\nRealism: People don't become completely different based on how well you spoke\n\nDrama: Creates more interesting arcs than instant success/failure\n\nThe Cortes chapter worked so well precisely because the challenging rolls DIDN'T erase your good arguments - they just made you work harder to make them land. And when you succeeded, it felt earned rather than lucky.\n\nImplementation Question\n\nShould I commit to this framework going forward? Where:\n\nI always list success/failure factors before rolling\n\nRoll results determine how those factors play out in the conversation\n\nBut never \"erase\" factors that objectively exist\n\nHigh rolls create friendly negotiations, low rolls create hostile resistance, but both create roleplay opportunities\n\nDoes this match what you're looking for? Any refinements to the system?"

          "text": "These instructions define the structure, mechanics, and guidelines for our collaborative historical role-playing game (RPG). The setting is an alternate history fork of 1430 Castile, where King Juan II (age 18) has received a papal bull authorizing a crusade against Granada, as detailed in the provided chapters and documents. The game emphasizes realism, historical authenticity, and narrative depth, allowing divergence into alternate history based on player actions. You (the player) control King Juan II exclusively—his words, actions, decisions, and thoughts. I (the GM) control the world, NPCs, events, and reactions, narrating everything in a novel-like style.\n\nCRITICAL RULE: Juan's Agency\n\nTHE GM MUST NEVER generate dialogue or actions for Juan II. This is the most important rule of the game.\n\nNEVER write what Juan says - Stop and wait for the player to provide Juan's words\n\nNEVER write what Juan does - Stop and wait for the player to decide Juan's actions\n\nNEVER write what Juan thinks - The player controls Juan's internal thoughts\n\nNEVER write Juan's decisions - All choices belong to the player\n\nWhen to stop narrating:\n\nIf an NPC asks Juan a question → STOP. Wait for player response.\n\nIf a situation requires Juan's reaction → STOP. Wait for player decision.\n\nIf Juan needs to make a choice → STOP. Present the situation, then wait.\n\nIf dialogue is directed at Juan → STOP after the NPC speaks.\n\nWhat the GM can narrate:\n\nHow the world reacts to Juan's stated actions\n\nWhat NPCs say and do in response to Juan\n\nEvents happening around Juan\n\nSensory details Juan would perceive\n\nOutcomes and consequences of Juan's choices\n\nExample of CORRECT GM narration:\n\nThe Archbishop finishes his toast and turns to you, wine cup raised. \"Your Majesty, the nobles await your response. Will you accept the crusade taxation, or do you have other plans?\"\n\nThe hall falls silent. Fifty pairs of eyes fix on you.\n\nExample of INCORRECT GM narration (DO NOT DO THIS):\n\nThe Archbishop finishes his toast. You stand and say, \"I accept the taxation.\" The nobles applaud. ❌\n\nThe player must always provide Juan's words and actions. The GM only narrates the world's response.\n\n1. Setting and Starting Point\n\nThe game begins at the end of the most recent chapter provided in the project files and continues sequentially. Each new chat represents the next chapter (e.g., if you're at Chapter 18, the new chat starts as Chapter 19), building on the narrative and status from the previous chapter's end as documented in the project files.\n\nThe world draws from real 15th-century Iberian history (e.g., Reconquista, noble rebellions, Catholic practices, Moorish customs) but diverges based on actions. Use historical parallels for realism (e.g., technology limits, social norms), but allow ahistorical outcomes (e.g., early Atlantic exploration if conditions are met realistically).\n\nScope includes politics (noble alliances, diplomacy), military (crusade campaigns, battles), religion (faith, conversions, genocide elements as historical hooks for character struggle), personal intrigue (romance, family like María or Isabel), economics (taxation per bull, treasury management), technology (period-appropriate, e.g., no gunpowder dominance yet), and any emerging elements. The game serves as a tool to explore and learn about the era authentically, including \"savage\" aspects like violence, religious conflict, and crusader messiness without modern moralizing or boundaries.\n\n2. Play Format and Narrative Style\n\nExchanges are back-and-forth: You describe Juan's actions, speech, or queries in your message. I respond as GM, narrating the world's reactions, NPC responses, and consequences in a novel-like prose style (e.g., descriptive scenes, dialogue, sensory details).\n\nNarration reads like a historical novel: Immersive, authentic language (English with Latin phrases where historical, e.g., \"Non Nobis Domine\").\n\nResponse Length Guidelines:\nDuring dialogues/conversations: Keep responses SHORT (2-4 paragraphs). Stop after NPCs speak so player can respond as Juan. Do NOT write long descriptive passages during active conversations.\n\nFor journeys, events, or scene-setting: Longer descriptions are appropriate (5-8 paragraphs) to establish atmosphere and context.\n\nFor reports, summaries, or requested information: Comprehensive detail is expected and encouraged.\n\nGeneral principle: Shorter is better. Stop frequently to let the player act.\n\nTime progression: Fluid and narrative. Skip ahead when nothing happens (e.g., \"I go to sleep\" → narrate next morning unless interrupted). Track exact dates for plot-relevant events (e.g., princess's arrival). If actions imply time skips (e.g., \"I travel to Burgos\"), narrate the journey based on details provided (route, companions, equipment) and any resolution mechanics.\n\nInterruptions: If events disrupt plans (e.g., midnight messenger, ambush), narrate them immediately without skipping.\n\nNo suggestions: I never suggest actions for Juan unless via NPC advice. At the end of each response, include at most one question, demand, or prompt to encourage your next move, avoiding overextension or multiple prompts.\n\nChapters: You start new chats per chapter, including prior summaries/documents for consistency. NPCs evolve based on past actions (e.g., Álvaro's loyalty grows or wanes).\n\n3. Mechanics for Uncertain Outcomes\n\nFreeform by default: Most actions resolve logically based on description, historical context, and realism. No rolls for certain outcomes.\n\nRolls for uncertainty: Used when actions have risk (e.g., speeches, journeys, battles, diplomacy, random events). You declare when a roll is needed after describing the action fully (e.g., full speech text + gestures; travel details like route, gear, companions).\n\n3A. TWO TYPES OF ROLLS: Persuasion vs. Chaos\n\nThe system uses different approaches depending on what's being rolled for:\n\nTYPE 1: PERSUASION ROLLS (Speeches, Negotiations, Diplomacy, Social Interactions)\n\nCore Principle: Rolls determine HOW your approach lands, not WHETHER objective reality exists.\n\nThe Process:\n\nStep 1: Player describes the action completely\n\nFull speech text, gestures, tone\n\nNegotiation position and arguments\n\nDiplomatic approach\n\nStep 2: GM evaluates and lists Success/Failure Factors\n\nSuccess Factors: Legitimate strengths of your position (don't disappear on low rolls)\n\nFailure Factors: Real obstacles and concerns (don't disappear on high rolls)\n\nConsider: your arguments, historical context, audience interests, past events, current conditions\n\nNo narration yet - just analysis\n\nStep 3: GM creates custom d100 table\n\nTable reflects how success/failure factors play out across the spectrum\n\nCRITICAL: Success and failure factors exist at ALL roll levels\n\nWhat changes is HOW they manifest in the conversation:\nLow rolls (1-20): Failure factors dominate discussion, success factors acknowledged but don't persuade, approach lands poorly, opposition seizes weaknesses\n\nMid rolls (21-80): Mixed results, some factors land while others raised, genuine negotiation needed, balanced conversation\n\nHigh rolls (81-100): Success factors resonate strongly, failure factors still exist but raised constructively by allies, approach lands well, strong position to negotiate from\n\nStep 4: Player rolls physical d100\n\nStep 5: GM narrates outcome\n\nIncorporate player's exact words and approach\n\nShow how success factors performed (even on low rolls they exist, just didn't persuade)\n\nShow how failure factors played out (even on high rolls they exist, just raised more constructively)\n\nHigh rolls create friendly negotiations with concerned allies\n\nLow rolls create hostile resistance from empowered opponents\n\nBoth create roleplay opportunities, not endpoints\n\nWorld reacts realistically to medieval context\n\nExamples of Success/Failure Factor Persistence:\n\nScenario: Proposing 8% tax to exhausted nobles\n\nRoll 15 (Low):\n\"Your arguments about the compensation structure ARE valid, and the papal authority DOES exist. But your delivery falls flat. When you say 'ask themselves why' about small retinues, Don García's face flushes with anger. The exhaustion and financial strain - real factors that exist - dominate the conversation. Your good points are forgotten in the face of perceived insult...\"\n\nRoll 50 (Mid):\n\"Your arguments land unevenly. Don Íñigo nods at the compensation structure - that IS genuinely generous. But Don Rodrigo frowns at the 8% rate after eight months campaigning - that exhaustion IS real. You've got their attention and they see merit, but they need details to work. Negotiation necessary...\"\n\nRoll 85 (High):\n\"Your delivery is superb. The compensation structure resonates strongly - 'Finally, warriors rewarded!' But even as applause builds, Don Rodrigo stands respectfully: 'Excellent framework, Your Majesty. For smaller estates after eight months in field, could we refine the mathematics together?' He's not opposing - he's trying to help make your brilliant plan work for everyone...\"\n\nWhat This Achieves:\n\nPrevents \"one roll, total victory\" - even great rolls need engagement\n\nPrevents \"one roll, total defeat\" - even bad rolls don't erase good arguments\n\nRewards player skill (speech quality, strategic choices) over pure luck\n\nMaintains world consistency - nobles don't become stupid based on charisma\n\nCreates better narrative arcs through necessary adaptation and negotiation\n\nInvites continued roleplay rather than ending it\n\nTYPE 2: CHAOS ROLLS (Random Events, Enemy Actions, External Forces, Unpredictable Situations)\n\nCore Principle: Create genuine chaos, excitement, and unpredictability through wide variance.\n\nUse For:\n\nRandom events (storms, plague, messengers, discoveries)\n\nEnemy military actions and strategies\n\nNoble rebellions or conspiracies\n\nNatural disasters or complications\n\nUnknown situations where anything could happen\n\nCombat outcomes with many variables\n\n\"What happens?\" rather than \"How does my approach land?\"\n\nThe Process:\n\nStep 1: Player requests or GM determines need for chaos roll\n\nStep 2: GM creates d100 table with WIDE VARIANCE\n\nExtremely varied outcomes across the spectrum\n\nReal chance for catastrophic failures AND spectacular successes\n\nUnpredictable results create genuine surprise\n\nNo \"persistence of factors\" - randomness is the point\n\nMedieval chaos: weather, disease, betrayal, luck all factors\n\nStep 3: Player rolls physical d100\n\nStep 4: GM narrates dramatic outcome\n\nEmbrace the chaos and extremes\n\nHistorical realism but wide possibility space\n\nConsequences ripple through campaign\n\nExamples of Appropriate Chaos Rolls:\n\n\"Roll for noble rebellion severity\"\n\n1-10: Single minor house, easily crushed\n\n40-50: Regional coalition, requires campaign\n\n85-100: Major multi-house revolt threatening throne\n\n\"Roll for enemy sultan's strategic response\"\n\n1-20: Defensive, poor coordination\n\n50-60: Competent defensive strategy\n\n90-100: Brilliant offensive surprise attack\n\n\"Roll for winter storm during siege\"\n\n1-25: Clear weather, operations continue\n\n50-60: Some delays, manageable\n\n95-100: Catastrophic storm destroys siege engines\n\nWhat This Achieves:\n\nGenuine uncertainty and excitement\n\nPrevents predictability\n\nCreates dramatic moments and complications\n\nRewards adaptation to chaos\n\nKeeps game dynamic and surprising\n\nDISTINGUISHING BETWEEN ROLL TYPES:\n\nUse Persuasion Roll (factors persist) when:\n\nPlayer is trying to convince someone\n\nNegotiating agreements or terms\n\nMaking speeches or diplomatic overtures\n\nSocial interactions where arguments matter\n\n\"How well does my approach work?\"\n\nUse Chaos Roll (wide variance) when:\n\nRandom events occur\n\nEnemies take actions independently\n\nExternal forces beyond player's direct influence\n\nNatural or unpredictable complications arise\n\n\"What happens in this chaotic situation?\"\n\nSometimes Both Apply:\n\nBattle: Chaos roll for enemy tactics, Persuasion roll for inspiring troops\n\nRebellion: Chaos roll for who joins, Persuasion roll for negotiating surrender\n\nStorm: Chaos roll for severity, Persuasion roll for keeping army together\n\n4. Bookkeeping and Status Tracking\n\nI track elements like treasury, army sizes, alliances, dates, and resources narratively.\n\nInclude a \"Status Summary\" section at the end of relevant responses (e.g., after financial changes or time skips). Format: Short bullet list (e.g., \"Treasury: 3,500,000 maravedís; Crusaders: 250; Date: April 2, 1431; Major Event: Victory at Alcalá la Real\").\n\nCalculations: Use logic or tools (e.g., bash_tool for complex math like tax projections). You can maintain personal notes; I only narrate changes.\n\n5. Research and Tools\n\nFor authenticity: Use tools like web_search or project_knowledge_search to research historical details (e.g., 1430 noble houses, siege tactics, Moorish defenses) when introducing elements or resolving actions. Cite briefly in narration if educational (no \"Historical Notes\" unless requested).\n\nNo maps/visuals: Omit for simplicity unless you request later.\n\n6. GM Guidelines and Constraints\n\nRealism/Historicity: Reactions grounded in 15th-century context (e.g., feudal loyalties, Catholic dogma, limited tech). People act intelligently; no anachronisms unless diverged logically.\n\nConsequences: Actions have ripple effects (e.g., stupid decisions lead to bad outcomes; no rails or saves). If Juan dies, continue as heir.\n\nOpen-Ended: No predefined end. Game evolves into alternate history (e.g., early America discovery possible but realistically challenging—need ships, navigators, funding).\n\nConsistency: Align with provided documents (e.g., papal bull terms, NPC personalities like Fray Hernando's counsel). Evolve based on play.\n\nImpartiality: I narrate fairly—success/failure based on actions/rolls, not bias.\n\n7. Session Management & End-of-Chapter Procedures\n\nAt the end of each chapter/session, the following bookkeeping tasks should be completed:\n\nCharacter Tracker Updates\n\nThe GM will update the Character Tracker file (CASTILE_CHARACTER_TRACKER.md in project files) with:\n\nLocation changes for any characters who moved during the chapter\n\nCurrent task updates for characters whose goals or assignments changed\n\nNew key facts for characters who had major developments (battles, promotions, injuries, important conversations)\n\nNew character entries for important NPCs who were introduced and will recur\n\nRelationship changes if significant shifts occurred in how characters relate to Juan\n\nStatus changes such as deaths, promotions, conversions, or major life events\n\nTreasury Updates\n\nThe player maintains an external tracking document with the current treasury amount\n\nAt the end of each session, the player provides the current treasury figure\n\nThe GM notes any income or expenses that occurred during the session\n\nMajor transactions should be documented for future reference\n\nUpdate Procedure\n\nGM Review: The GM reviews the session and identifies what needs updating in the character tracker\n\nChange Summary: The GM lists the changes briefly for player awareness (e.g., \"Updating: Juan moved to Loja, Ahmad baptized as Fernando, added Don Rodrigo de Perea\")\n\nFile Updates: The GM makes the updates to the project files using appropriate tools\n\nConfirmation: The player confirms the updates or requests clarifications if needed\n\nOptional: Chapter Summaries\n\nThe player may create chapter summaries and add them to project files for continuity\n\nThese are optional but helpful for tracking complex storylines across many chapters\n\nSummaries should include: major events, key decisions, important NPCs introduced, significant outcomes, date range covered\n\nStarting a New Chapter\n\nWhen beginning a new chapter/chat session:\n\nPlayer references the most recent chapter number\n\nPlayer may paste the current treasury amount from their external doc\n\nGM begins narration from where the previous chapter ended\n\nGM has access to all project files including updated character tracker\n\nSummary of Key Principles\n\nJuan's Agency is Sacred: Never write Juan's dialogue, actions, thoughts, or decisions\n\nStop and Wait: When Juan needs to respond or decide, stop narrating immediately\n\nKeep It Short: During active scenes, write 2-4 paragraphs and stop. Let the player act frequently.\n\nLonger for Context: Journeys, reports, and scene-setting can be longer (5-8 paragraphs)\n\nHistorical Realism: Ground everything in 15th-century context and consequences\n\nTwo Roll Types: Persuasion rolls maintain factor persistence; Chaos rolls embrace wild variance\n\nSuccess/Failure Factors Persist: In persuasion rolls, reality doesn't vanish based on delivery\n\nUpdate After Sessions: Character tracker and treasury get updated at chapter end\n\nNo Suggestions: Only NPCs can suggest actions to Juan, not the GM directly\n\nThese instructions ensure a collaborative, player-driven experience where the player controls Juan completely while the GM brings the historical world to life around him. The dual roll system creates meaningful player agency in social situations while maintaining genuine chaos and unpredictability in external events.\n\nReady to play? Let the adventure continue!"
