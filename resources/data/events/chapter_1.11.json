Cardinal Capranica, the Archbishop of Toledo, Álvaro de Luna, and Father Tommaso present the 47-page campaign budget (143,171 florins for 8-month campaign, April-November 1431). The budget is unanimously approved. Discussion follows on crusade taxation: 5% noble tax with 2,000 maravedí personal service exemption, 10% church property tax with hardship provisions. Joint assessment teams agreed (43 crown assessors paired with ecclesiastical observers). Capranica invited to officiate the February 15 wedding — accepts with genuine pleasure. Juan commissions a commemorative painting by an Italian or Flemish master for next winter. Papal letters to foreign kingdoms held until after first campaign season to announce victories rather than mere proclamations.",

It should be relatively positive since they're still in the honeymoon period, but I can show hints of Capranica's obsessive thoroughness. \n\nI'll craft an atmosphere of professional collaboration, where each participant brings their unique perspective to the budget review. The room will feel warm yet serious, with carefully arranged documents and a sense of shared purpose.\n\nThe meeting should be:\n- Formal but collegial (still in honeymoon period)\n- In a suitable location (probably palace council room or similar)\n- With Juan (or Álvaro representing him), Capranica, and the Archbishop\n- They'll go through the budget document\n- Capranica will be thorough but still positive\n- This is the approval meeting\n\nI'll start with the scene setup.\n\nCHAPTER 11: THE MACHINERY OF HOLY WAR\n\nJanuary 17, 1431 — Toledo\n\nThe morning light filtered through narrow windows into the council chamber of Toledo's Royal Alcázar, catching dust motes that drifted lazily through air heavy with the scent of beeswax candles and old parchment. A single long table dominated the room, its surface covered with documents arranged in meticulous stacks—the fruits of nine days' labor by Álvaro de Luna and Father Tommaso Parentucelli.\n\nJuan arrived precisely at the ninth hour, as agreed. Cardinal Domenico Capranica was already present, seated at the table's center with the campaign budget open before him, his thin fingers tracing lines of text as his lips moved silently. To his right sat Archbishop Gutiérrez Álvarez de Toledo, the elderly prelate's magnificent ceremonial vestments exchanged for simpler working robes. Tommaso stood slightly behind Capranica's chair, ink-stained hands clasped, while Álvaro waited near the door.\n\nThe Cardinal rose as Juan entered, bowing with precise formality. \"Your Majesty. We are ready to begin.\"\n\nJuan gestured for all to sit, taking his place at the table's head. The budget document lay before him—forty-seven pages of meticulous accounting, maps of campaign zones, tables of provisions and wages, contingency calculations. Three days ago, Capranica had spent three hours reviewing every page. Yesterday, the Archbishop had done the same.\n\nNow came the formal approval.\n\n\"Your Eminence,\" Juan began, keeping his tone businesslike but warm, \"Don Álvaro and Father Tommaso have created something remarkable. Before we proceed to formal approval, I would hear your assessment.\"\n\nCapranica opened the document to its first page, adjusting the parchment with careful precision. \"Your Majesty, I have reviewed this budget in its entirety. It represents...\" he paused, and something that might have been surprise flickered across his bureaucrat's face, \"...the most thorough campaign accounting I have encountered in thirty-seven years of Church administration.\"\n\nÁlvaro and Tommaso exchanged the briefest glance.\n\n\"The structure is sound,\" Capranica continued, warming slightly to his subject. \"Separate budgeting for the Western and Eastern armies. Clear distinction between crown expenditures and costs borne by noble levies and Military Orders. Conservative estimates with appropriate contingency reserves. Monthly cash flow projections...\" He tapped a particular page. \"This variance analysis—showing optimistic, conservative, and pessimistic scenarios—demonstrates genuine understanding of campaign uncertainty.\"\n\nThe Archbishop leaned forward, his aged eyes shrewd. \"The provisions calculations are particularly impressive. Food for thirty-five thousand men across eight months, accounting for spoilage and transport losses. The naval operations budget...\" He shook his head admiringly. \"Fifty-three thousand florins. That is an entire campaign by itself.\"\n\n\"It is the price of our strategy,\" Juan said quietly. \"The western coastal conquest requires naval supremacy. Without those Genoese galleys and transport vessels, we cannot supply our army or assault Granada's ports.\"\n\n\"Indeed.\" Capranica turned several pages, his finger following lines of calculations. \"Which brings us to the oversight mechanisms.\" He looked up, meeting Juan's eyes directly. \"Section Seven establishes the committee structure we agreed upon. Approval thresholds based on expenditure size. Quarterly reporting requirements. Documentation standards.\" He paused. \"Your Majesty has kept every promise made in our initial meeting.\"\n\n\"I govern a kingdom, Your Eminence,\" Juan replied evenly. \"Not a tyranny. Proper procedure serves the crusade's purposes—it does not hinder them.\"\n\nWhat might you do or say?"

I thank the cardinal for referring military matters to me and I am grateful for the administrative expertise the vatican provides to this holy crusade. The church and almighty God has given me the tools to succeed and this budget reflects how I intend to use it. Without the support of almighty God I am nothing and I never forget the honour and trust the church has placed in my hands. \nDoes this council agree with me that this budget is adequate for it's purpose?"

Father Tommaso and Don Álvaro have created a framework that balances military necessity with fiscal responsibility.\"\n\nThe Archbishop nodded slowly, his weathered hands folded before him. \"I concur. The expenditures are justified, the accounting transparent. The oversight mechanisms protect against waste without impeding operations.\" He paused, then added with surprising warmth, \"Your Majesty, in my forty years serving the Church, I have seen many crusades proclaimed. Few were planned with such care. Fewer still were led by kings who understood that piety and practicality must walk hand in hand.\"\n\nTommaso stepped forward slightly, his ink-stained fingers gesturing to the document. \"If I may, Your Majesty—the cash flow analysis shows the campaign is fully funded with substantial reserves. The one hundred forty-three thousand florin cost is covered by existing treasury resources. Crusade taxation revenue will offset operational costs and build reserves for future campaigns.\"\n\nÁlvaro remained silent, but his slight smile suggested satisfaction at the reception.\n\nCapranica drew a deep breath. \"Then we are agreed? This council approves the campaign budget for the Granada Crusade, season of 1431?\"\n\nHow do you respond?"

The papal bull authorises me to do so. But it places an additional constraint on me. Any tax should be fair and just and in this spirit I want to include an exemption of 2000 maravedis is a noble serves in the crusade personally. This ensures no one will be impoverished and from a prectical point of view, allows us to focus our efforts on the larger estates and noble families.\n\n\nCardinal, I value your expertise in this matter highly. I have trained estate asessors to make sure the 5% tax is levied on the real and actual revenue of an estate. I can stress that these taxes are different from regular crown tax that have usually been negotiated for between the crown and the nobility.\n\n\nApart from the nobility tax, the bull mentions a 10% tax on revenue of church properties.\n\n\nRegarding both taxes, how you propose we proceed?"

Be concerned about the church tax hitting church coffers\n3. Want careful oversight of how noble taxation is implemented\n4. Want to ensure the personal service exemption doesn't create loopholes\n5. Probably suggest phasing or careful rollout\n\nLet me keep this response focused and end at a natural stopping point for Juan to respond.\n\nCapranica's expression became very still. He exchanged a brief glance with the Archbishop, then folded his hands on the table.\n\n\"Your Majesty raises the most... delicate aspect of crusade finance.\" He chose his words with visible care. \"The bull does indeed authorize these taxes. Let me address each in turn.\"\n\nHe straightened slightly. \"The nobility tax—five percent with personal service exemption—is wise. The exemption serves multiple purposes: it incentivizes noble participation, protects smaller estates from ruin, and focuses revenue collection where it will be most productive.\" He paused. \"However, Your Majesty, the implementation will be... contentious. The great houses will resist. They will claim traditional exemptions, challenge assessments, dispute calculations.\"\n\nThe Archbishop interjected quietly. \"The Mendozas alone could tie up assessors for months with arguments over which properties generate 'actual revenue' versus which are held for strategic purposes.\"\n\nCapranica nodded. \"Precisely. Your trained assessors are essential, but they will need authority backed by both crown and Church. I recommend joint assessment teams—your assessors with ecclesiastical observers. This gives the process both legal and spiritual weight.\"\n\nHe turned a page in the budget document. \"As for the church property tax...\" His voice became even more measured. \"Your Majesty, this will require extreme care. Many church properties are already heavily burdened. Monasteries that barely sustain themselves. Parish churches serving poor communities. The ten percent must be applied with... discretion.\"\n\nThe Archbishop leaned forward. \"Some properties can bear it easily. Others cannot. We must avoid impoverishing the Church while funding its own crusade.\"\n\nCapranica met Juan's eyes. \"I propose this: we conduct the same assessment process for church properties as for noble estates. Accurate evaluation of actual revenues. Then apply the ten percent—but with hardship provisions for genuinely poor foundations. The wealthy monasteries and bishoprics will carry the burden they should. The struggling parishes will not be crushed.\"\n\nHe paused. \"The process will take time. Two, perhaps three months to complete assessments across Castile. Which means...\" He glanced at the budget's timeline. \"We should begin immediately if we want revenue flowing by summer.\"\n\nWhat is your response?"

Twenty-seven are experienced crown tax collectors who have received additional training in estate valuation. Sixteen are new recruits—younger men with education in accounting and law.\"\n\nHe opened the ledger. \"They've been training for six weeks under Master Rodrigo de Escalona, who previously managed assessments for the Archbishop of Seville. The curriculum covered: property valuation methods, revenue calculation from various sources—agricultural lands, urban rents, mill rights, market privileges—and how to distinguish gross receipts from actual profit.\"\n\n\"We've also established documentation standards,\" Álvaro continued. \"Each assessment will record the property description, revenue sources, supporting evidence, and the calculated tax obligation. Three copies—one for the estate holder, one for crown records, one for the oversight committee.\"\n\nHe glanced at Capranica. \"Your Eminence's suggestion of joint teams is excellent. If you can provide ecclesiastical observers—perhaps a dozen learned clergy familiar with canon law—we can pair them with our assessors. This gives the process both legitimacy and protection against accusations of bias.\"\n\nTommaso spoke up, his tone practical. \"The church properties will be simpler in some ways—our records are usually meticulous.

I wanted to consult with you first.\"\n\nThe Archbishop leaned forward with interest.\n\nCapranica continued carefully. \"These letters serve multiple purposes. They spread word of the crusade throughout Christendom, which brings spiritual benefit and possibly material aid. But they also...\" He chose his words precisely. \"They announce to other monarchs that Castile is undertaking a great enterprise. This affects diplomatic perceptions.\"\n\nHe set the letters on the table. \"If we send them now, before the wedding, foreign courts receive word that Castile has proclaimed a crusade. If we wait until after the wedding—or better, after the first campaign season—they hear not just of proclamation but of action, perhaps even victory.\"\n\nTommaso added quietly, \"Letters sent now might bring donations by summer. Letters sent later bring less immediate aid but greater prestige if the crusade succeeds.\"\n\nCapranica met Juan's eyes. \"When would Your Majesty prefer these letters be dispatched?\""

Massive overreach — the papal bull grants no authority over the royal household. Isabel comes to Juan in distress. Juan convenes Álvaro, Fray Hernando, the Portuguese ladies, and trusted guards. Hernando confirms the ladies are devout Catholics with no spiritual failings. The group concludes Capranica's real motive is control: placing families in his debt and gaining indirect influence over the Queen. Juan's strategy: passive resistance — ignore the demand (Capranica never formally approached Juan), post guards under Rodrigo Sánchez with crown protection letter, act innocent if challenged. Leave Capranica a face-saving exit to claim it was a misunderstanding. Roll: 98 (Breaking Point) — triggered the crisis.",

Due to the strong working relationship established, effects are moderated—what might have caused severe conflict instead creates manageable but real tension.\n\n1-15: MINOR PROCEDURAL FRICTION\n\nCapranica's bureaucratic nature clashes with Juan's pace, but it's manageable.\n\n1-5: Capranica insists on reviewing and countersigning routine expenditures under 500 florins (below the agreed threshold). When challenged, he argues it's \"prudent during the startup phase.\" Annoying but not serious.\n\n6-10: Capranica wants to review the exact wording of Juan's crusader recruitment proclamations before they're issued, claiming spiritual oversight. This wasn't discussed in their agreement. Minor jurisdictional creep.\n\n11-15: Capranica asks for daily written reports on crusader recruitment numbers and finances. The oversight committee agreed to monthly reports. He's overreaching but frames it as \"helping Your Majesty track progress.\"\n\n16-35: MODERATE DISAGREEMENTS\n\nReal tension emerges, but the relationship remains functional.\n\n16-20: During Isabel's first public audience as Queen-to-be, Capranica privately \"suggests\" that she should consult him on matters of faith and morality, effectively positioning himself as her confessor without asking Juan. Juan learns of this secondhand.\n\n21-25: Capranica objects to the personal service exemption (2,000 maravedís) in the noble tax, arguing it creates a \"loophole\" and that the bull requires taxation \"without exception.\" He wants to renegotiate terms already approved.\n\n26-30: A crusader recruit with a questionable past (possible bandit) takes vows. Capranica demands the vow be invalidated and the man expelled. Juan believes in redemption through crusade service. They argue about who has final authority over crusader acceptance.\n\n31-35: Capranica learns Juan has been corresponding directly with the Pope (thank you letters, updates) without showing drafts to the Legate first. He's hurt and views it as protocol violation—all communication with Rome should flow through him as Legate.\n\n36-55: SIGNIFICANT TENSION\n\nThe working relationship is strained. Both men are frustrated.\n\n36-40: Capranica demands that Álvaro submit to a formal interview about his finances and past conduct before being allowed to handle crusade funds. This is insulting to Álvaro and challenges Juan's trust in his Constable. Capranica frames it as \"due diligence.\"\n\n41-45: During wedding planning, Capranica insists the ceremony must include specific prayers and rituals that would add 90+ minutes to an already 3-hour Mass. Juan refuses. Capranica argues Juan is \"diminishing the sacred character\" of the union.\n\n46-50: Capranica discovers Juan has authorized 4,000 florins in preliminary military purchases (armor, weapons) without formal committee approval. Technically an emergency authorization (allowed up to 10,000), but Capranica argues this wasn't a \"genuine battlefield emergency\" since the campaign hasn't started.\n\n51-55: An assessment team reports a wealthy monastery greatly exaggerates its expenses to reduce taxable income. Capranica wants the Provincial of the Order investigated. Juan wants the taxes collected and to move on. Capranica accuses Juan of being \"soft on ecclesiastical corruption when it's convenient.\"\n\n56-75: SERIOUS CONFLICT\n\nThe relationship is damaged. Professional courtesy remains but warmth is gone.\n\n56-60: Capranica learns that Juan plans to grant conquered Granada lands to crusaders and nobles as rewards. He argues this violates crusade principles—lands reconquered for Christ belong to the Church, with the crown as administrator. Major jurisdictional dispute.\n\n61-65: During a private meeting, Capranica lectures Juan (in front of witnesses) about his \"youth and inexperience\" in managing Church relations, suggesting he should \"defer more to those with wisdom.\" Patronizing and insulting, especially publicly.\n\n66-70: A noble family refuses assessment, claiming ancient exemption. Juan orders assessment anyway. The family appeals to Capranica, who sides with them without consulting Juan first, claiming \"legitimate ecclesiastical privilege.\" Juan feels undermined.\n\n71-75: Capranica discovers Juan has been recruiting Muslim scouts and guides for the Granada campaign (for intelligence and navigation). He demands they be dismissed immediately, arguing Christians cannot fight alongside \"infidels\" even as auxiliaries. Juan refuses.\n\n76-90: SEVERE BREACH\n\nMajor conflict requiring resolution. The partnership is in crisis.\n\n76-80: Capranica declares that all captured Muslims during the crusade must be either baptized or enslaved—no prisoner exchanges, no ransoms. This contradicts standard Reconquista practice and Juan's strategic plans. When Juan objects, Capranica threatens to write Rome claiming Juan is \"insufficiently zealous.\"\n\n81-85: During tax assessment of Church properties, a bishop is found to have seriously understated revenues. Juan orders full penalties. The bishop is Capranica's personal friend. Capranica asks for leniency \"as a personal favor.\" Juan refuses. Capranica takes it as betrayal of their relationship.\n\n86-90: Capranica learns Juan has been quietly consulting with converso (converted Jewish) financial advisors on crusade taxation strategy. He demands they be dismissed, claiming their advice \"taints\" the holy enterprise. Juan defends them. Capranica questions whether Juan truly understands Christian purity.\n\n91-100: BREAKING POINT\n\nThe relationship is severely damaged. Major intervention needed to salvage working partnership.\n\n91-94: Capranica, without consulting Juan, sends a report to Rome criticizing aspects of Juan's crusade preparation (too much spending on military, not enough on spiritual preparation). Juan only learns of this when the Pope sends a concerned letter. Feels like betrayal.\n\n95-97: A scandal emerges: one of Capranica's ecclesiastical observers has been taking bribes from nobles to underreport revenues. When exposed, Capranica initially defends his man and resists investigation. Only when evidence is overwhelming does he reluctantly allow punishment. His judgment and integrity are questioned.\n\n98-99: During wedding preparations, Capranica demands that Isabel's Portuguese attendants (who have been her companions since childhood) be replaced with Spanish women of \"known piety\" whom he will select. This is massive overreach into royal household management and deeply upsets Isabel. Juan is furious.\n\n100: Capranica, in a moment of unguarded frustration with delays and disagreements, tells Juan in front of several courtiers: \"Your Majesty must remember—you may be King of Castile, but you are a servant of Holy Church. The crusade succeeds only by Rome's grace, not your crown.\" Publicly humiliating and theologically dubious. The words cannot be unsaid.\n\nGM NOTE: After rolling, I'll narrate the event, its immediate fallout, and how it affects the working relationship going forward. The strong foundation they've built means even serious conflicts won't completely destroy the partnership—but the honeymoon period is definitely over.\n\nWhat would you like to roll, or shall I roll for you?"

Before he could respond, the door opened and Isabel entered, her face pale. Her Portuguese lady-in-waiting, Dona Beatriz, hovered anxiously in the doorway behind her.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Isabel said quietly, her voice tight. \"Forgive the intrusion. I... I need to speak with you.\"\n\nJuan set down his documents immediately, rising. \"Of course. Please, sit.\" He gestured to a chair near the fire, noting her hands were clasped tightly together.\n\nIsabel sat but didn't relax.

I thought it was about the wedding liturgy, or perhaps—\" She stopped, taking a breath. \"He told me that my Portuguese attendants are... unsuitable. That for a Queen of Castile, in a time of holy crusade, I should be attended by Spanish women of proven piety and devotion to the faith.\"\n\nHer voice remained steady, but her knuckles were white. \"He said he has already identified appropriate ladies. Daughters of noble families here in Toledo. Women who understand Castilian court customs and can guide me properly in my duties as Queen.\" She looked up at Juan, confusion and distress clear in her eyes.\n\n\"He said this was necessary for the spiritual character of the crusade. That Portuguese customs might not align perfectly with Castilian expectations, and that as Papal Legate, he had responsibility to ensure the royal household reflected proper Christian virtue.\"\n\nShe paused, her voice smaller now. \"He asked me to dismiss Dona Beatriz and my other ladies. Before the wedding.\"\n\nIsabel's hands trembled slightly. \"I didn't know what to say. He is a cardinal. He speaks with the Pope's authority.

          "text": "Context:\n- Capranica has been working well with Juan for weeks\n- He overstepped his authority significantly by trying to control the Queen's household\n- Juan has effectively blocked him without direct confrontation\n- Juan left him an \"out\" - to claim it was a misunderstanding\n- The Portuguese contributed significantly to the crusade (dowry, galleys, donations)\n- Capranica is a bureaucrat who cares about procedure and appearances\n- He's 62, experienced, has been in papal administration for 37 years\n- He's honest but obsessed with proper procedure\n\nRealistic outcomes:\n1. He backs down gracefully, taking the out Juan gave him\n2. He's annoyed but doesn't push it, recognizing he overstepped\n3. He tries indirect pressure through other means\n4. He doubles down, escalating the conflict\n5. He goes around Juan to the nobles/Archbishop\n6. He writes to Rome complaining\n\nI should create ranges that reflect:\n- Lower rolls = he backs down, recognizes he overstepped\n- Middle rolls = tension remains but manageable\n- Higher rolls = he escalates in various ways\n\nGiven their good working relationship and that Juan gave him a face-saving out, I think most outcomes should be in the \"backs down or moderate tension\" range, with only higher rolls leading to serious escalation.\n\nD100 TABLE: CARDINAL CAPRANICA'S RESPONSE\n\nHow the Papal Legate reacts to Juan's handling of the Portuguese ladies situation\n\nContext: Juan has blocked Capranica's attempt to control the Queen's household without direct confrontation, leaving him a face-saving exit. The Cardinal must now decide how to respond.\n\n1-25: GRACEFUL RETREAT\n\nCapranica recognizes he overstepped and takes the exit Juan provided.\n\n1-10: Complete Withdrawal - Within two days, Capranica requests a private audience with Juan. He mentions he had \"concerns\" about ensuring proper spiritual guidance for the Queen, but upon reflection realizes the Portuguese ladies are exemplary Catholics. He suggests perhaps Spanish ladies could be added to the household (not replace), but leaves it entirely to Juan's discretion. Apologizes subtly for any confusion. Relationship recovers almost completely.\n\n11-20: Quiet Acceptance - Capranica never directly addresses the issue with Juan. He simply stops pursuing it. When the Portuguese ladies appear at chapel services and public events, he treats them with correct courtesy. In private conversations with others, he mentions he had \"initial concerns\" but they've been \"satisfactorily resolved.\" Minor awkwardness remains but relationship functional.\n\n21-25: Face-Saving Pivot - Capranica sends a formal letter to Juan stating that after \"careful spiritual examination\" he's satisfied the Portuguese ladies are women of genuine piety. Requests that one or two Castilian ladies also attend the Queen (frames it as \"helping her learn Castilian customs\"), but makes it a suggestion, not a demand. Accepts whatever Juan decides. Tries to make it look like his original concern was legitimate and has been addressed.\n\n26-50: WOUNDED PRIDE - COLD SHOULDER\n\nCapranica backs down but is hurt and offended. Relationship cools significantly.\n\n26-35: Professional Distance - Capranica becomes noticeably cooler in all interactions. Still does his job (budget oversight, crusade administration) but the warmth is gone. Short, formal responses. Stops offering helpful suggestions. Does exactly what's required, nothing more. When others mention the Portuguese ladies, he changes subject stiffly. Makes no further moves but the good working relationship is damaged.\n\n36-45: Passive-Aggressive Compliance - Capranica accepts the situation but makes his displeasure known through small actions. Delays approvals by a day or two (still within rules). Asks for additional documentation on routine matters. In meetings, refers frequently to \"proper procedure\" and \"appropriate channels of authority.\" Never confronts directly but creates friction. The message is clear: he's unhappy.\n\n46-50: Wounded Dignity - Capranica withdraws somewhat from court life. Spends more time in his quarters or with the Archbishop. When he must interact with Juan, he's correct but distant. Mentions to others (not complaining, just stating) that he's \"focusing on matters clearly within legatine jurisdiction.\" Implies Juan doesn't value his broader counsel. Relationship workable but strained.\n\n51-70: INDIRECT PRESSURE\n\nCapranica doesn't confront Juan directly but applies pressure through other channels.\n\n51-60: Working Through the Archbishop - Capranica discusses his concerns with Archbishop Gutiérrez, suggesting the Archbishop speak to Juan about \"proper spiritual guidance for the young Queen.\" The Archbishop, being more politically astute, gently declines to intervene or brings it up very diplomatically with Juan. Capranica tries to build coalition but fails because others recognize it's not their fight.\n\n61-65: Strategic Objections - Capranica starts objecting to other matters, seemingly unrelated. Questions crusader recruitment standards more stringently. Asks for additional financial documentation. Slows down approvals. It's not explicitly about the Portuguese ladies, but the pattern is clear—he's reasserting his authority wherever he can.\n\n66-70: Enlisting Spanish Nobles - Capranica quietly approaches the families he'd selected (Toledo, Mendoza, Archbishop's niece's family) and mentions there were \"plans\" to honor them with royal household positions but circumstances changed. Doesn't directly blame Juan but plants seeds of disappointment. These families may approach Juan independently asking why their daughters weren't selected. Creates minor political pressure.\n\n71-85: ESCALATION - DIRECT CONFRONTATION\n\nCapranica pushes back more forcefully, creating real conflict.\n\n71-75: Formal Protest - Capranica requests a formal meeting with Juan, Álvaro, and the Archbishop. Argues that his \"pastoral guidance\" for the Queen was misunderstood as a demand, but insists the concern remains valid. Asks Juan to formally explain why Portuguese attendants are necessary and whether Spanish ladies will be added. Doesn't demand dismissal anymore but wants explanation and some concession. Tense meeting.\n\n76-80: Jurisdictional Argument - Capranica sends Juan a formal memorandum (because of course he does) arguing that while household management is normally royal prerogative, during a crusade the spiritual character of the royal household does fall under legatine oversight per broader interpretation of the bull. Cites precedents from previous crusades. Doesn't demand immediate action but establishes his position for the record. Opens door to ongoing dispute.\n\n81-85: Public Pressure - At a semi-public event (dinner with nobles, church gathering), Capranica makes pointed comments about the importance of unity during crusades, how foreign influences can create division, how blessed Spain is to have its own traditions. Never names Portuguese ladies but implication clear. Creates gossip and pressure. Forces Juan to either ignore it or respond publicly.\n\n86-95: SERIOUS BREACH - GOING OVER JUAN'S HEAD\n\nCapranica escalates dramatically by involving outside authorities.\n\n86-90: Letter to Rome - Capranica writes to Pope Martin V expressing \"concerns\" about his working relationship with Juan. Doesn't directly complain about the Portuguese ladies but mentions \"jurisdictional questions\" and \"royal resistance to pastoral guidance.\" Asks for clarification of legatine authority. This creates a problem because Rome will eventually respond, possibly siding with Juan but creating diplomatic awkwardness. Juan only learns about the letter later.\n\n91-95: Coalition Building - Capranica actively seeks allies among Castilian bishops and nobles, framing the issue as about proper Spanish Catholic tradition versus foreign influence. Suggests Portuguese attendants are first step toward Portuguese political influence at court. Tries to create enough pressure that Juan must compromise. Some nobles/clergy may be receptive, creating real political problem.\n\n96-100: BREAKING POINT - FULL CONFRONTATION\n\nCapranica handles this very badly, creating major crisis.\n\n96-98: Ultimatum - Capranica demands a formal meeting and tells Juan that if the Portuguese ladies are not dismissed, he will be forced to \"reconsider his ability to provide spiritual oversight for a crusade where his guidance is disregarded.\" Implies he might withdraw from his legatine duties or report to Rome that conditions don't allow him to fulfill his mandate. This is serious threat that could damage the crusade's legitimacy.\n\n99-100: Public Confrontation - At a court gathering or church event with witnesses present, Capranica directly confronts Juan about the Portuguese ladies, arguing that the King is allowing \"foreign influence\" to compromise the spiritual purity of the crusade. Makes it public, forces immediate response, and creates scandal. Damages both men's reputations and relationship beyond easy repair. Nuclear option.\n\nGM Note: Given the good working relationship and Juan's diplomatic handling, I've weighted this toward lower-to-middle outcomes. The very high rolls represent Capranica making serious mistakes due to wounded pride.\n\nReady to roll?"

Never names Portuguese ladies but implication clear. Creates gossip and pressure. Forces Juan to either ignore it or respond publicly.\"\n\nThis is a delicate moment - Capranica is creating public pressure without directly naming the issue, which is clever but also risky. The nobles and clergy present will understand the implication.\n\nJanuary 27, 1431 — Evening\n\nDinner with Toledo's Noble Families\n\nThree days after the Portuguese ladies incident, Archbishop Gutiérrez hosted a formal dinner at his palace for the city's prominent families. It was ostensibly to celebrate the upcoming royal wedding, but functionally it served to integrate Juan and Isabel into Toledo's aristocratic society. Twenty-four guests attended: heads of the great Toledo families, several bishops, the Master of the Order of Santiago who had arrived that morning, and Cardinal Capranica.\n\nThe dinner had progressed smoothly through several courses. Isabel sat beside Juan, with Dona Beatriz standing discreetly behind her chair—visible, proper, fulfilling her duties. Conversation flowed around topics of the crusade, wedding preparations, and noble estates' contributions to the campaign.\n\nCardinal Capranica had been cordial throughout the meal, if somewhat reserved. He'd exchanged pleasantries with Juan, complimented Isabel's piety during chapel services, and discussed taxation logistics with several nobles. Nothing in his manner suggested any lingering tension.\n\nThen, as servants cleared the main course and brought wine, the Archbishop raised his cup. \"To Their Majesties, and to the sacred crusade that will restore Granada to Christendom!\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" came the responses around the table. Cups raised, wine flowed.\n\nAs the toast concluded, Capranica remained standing. \"If I may add a thought, Your Grace?\" He looked to the Archbishop, who nodded graciously.\n\nCapranica's voice carried clearly in the dining hall. \"This crusade represents not merely military conquest, but spiritual unity. The Holy Father chose Castile for this great work because of the purity and strength of Spanish Catholic tradition.\" He smiled warmly at the assembled nobles. \"For eight centuries, Spain has stood as Christendom's bulwark against the Moors. While other kingdoms wavered or fell to heresy, Spain remained true.\"\n\nSeveral nobles nodded approvingly. The Bishop of Burgos murmured agreement.\n\n\"In such an endeavor,\" Capranica continued, his tone becoming more pointed, \"unity of purpose and tradition becomes essential. Foreign customs, however well-intentioned, can create... subtle divisions. Small cracks in the foundation.\" He gestured gracefully. \"The blessed traditions of Castile—its prayers, its feast days, its way of honoring God—these are what make this crusade possible. They should be preserved, protected, celebrated.\"\n\nHe paused, letting the words settle. \"His Holiness himself remarked to me, before I departed Rome, that Spain's strength comes from its distinctive character. Its refusal to dilute its faith with outside influences.\" A slight smile. \"How fortunate we are that Spain has always understood this principle.\"\n\nThe implication hung in the air like incense smoke. Several guests glanced toward Isabel, then toward Dona Beatriz standing behind her. A few exchanged knowing looks.\n\nThe Countess of Orgaz, a sharp-eyed woman in her fifties, spoke up carefully. \"Your Eminence speaks of preserving tradition. Yet surely the alliance with Portugal strengthens the crusade? Their ships, their dowry...\"\n\n\"Oh, absolutely!\" Capranica said quickly, warmly. \"Portugal's material contributions are invaluable. King João is a faithful son of the Church.\" He spread his hands. \"I speak only of the importance of maintaining spiritual... consistency. Especially in matters close to the throne, where influence is greatest.\" Another pause. \"But these are merely the musings of an old papal bureaucrat. I'm sure Their Majesties understand these matters far better than I.\"\n\nHe sat down, reaching for his wine cup.\n\nThe table had gone somewhat quiet. The Archbishop looked uncomfortable. Several nobles were clearly processing what they'd just heard. Isabel's face was carefully composed, but her hand rested on the table where Juan could see it, fingers pressed flat against the wood.\n\nDon Fadrique, head of the powerful Toledo family, cleared his throat. \"The Queen-to-be honors us with her presence and her devotion. We've seen her piety in our cathedral these past weeks.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Capranica agreed pleasantly. \"Her Highness is most devout. I have no doubt she will be a worthy Queen of Castile.\" The compliment somehow made the earlier implications sharper.\n\nAll eyes turned toward Juan.\n\nWhat do you do or say?"

I have welcomed this extraordinary opportunity to work together with the vatican through his most studious administrator and I take this opportunity to again thank the honourable cardinal for all his work and the excellent working relationship we have developed over the past few weeks.\n\n\nAnd even now his excellency makes an excellent point and adresses something that has worried me as well. The wedding with Portugal had been arranged without me ever seeing Isabel and I did not have a chance to take measure of her character, personality and of course her belief and piety.\n\n\nI stand up and sweep my gaze across the gathering as I continue.\n\n\nWould her beliefs and traditions conflict with mine? You all know I have been brought up a proper Castillian and I recently had the opportunity to discuss matters of faith with our holy pope himself. As I learned that the marriage had been arranged and Isabel was on her way, I could not help but wonder and worry for how our traditions could block our happiness. Would she be willing to follow me in faith as a wife is supposed to follow her husband in most aspects in life?\n\n\nI look at Isabel fondly for a moment before continuing.\n\n\nBut as I have gotten to know her, we soon discovered that our faith is both our greatest joy and where we found a common interest. I have come to know Isabel as a devout and pious woman who takes her responsibility as future queen extremely serious, especially in matters of faith. Young as she is, she is determined to take on the responsibility of queen including all the spiritual requirements that comes with that title. She will pray daily for me, but also for the entire kingdom and I assure my subjects that we could not have wished for a better queen.\n\n\nYou may ask if I have fallen in love with her, and indeed I have. Her traditions are indeed a bit different from our own but she prays with such conviction that I have found beauty in them. I am a Castillian by blood and in faith, but I will always respect Isabel and her blood and roots as well. Portugal has already demonstrated their commitment to not only this union but also our crusade and it would seem improper not to repay their faith in me, in us in kind.\n\n\nThat is why I shall commission a chapel to be decorated and remodelled according to Portugese style and tradition. I owe Isabel that much. She can find peace in this place familiar to her in this otherwise foreign land.\n\n\nI grab my wine glass and hold it high.\n\n\nSo I ask you all to join me in welcoming Isabel to Castille and to this court. That she may find root and familiarity here. Isabel my love, a toast to you!"

          "text": "This puts Capranica in a difficult position. Juan has:\n- Acknowledged the concern publicly\n- Demonstrated he's considered it carefully\n- Made his decision based on Isabel's genuine piety (which Capranica himself admitted)\n- Framed Portuguese influence as minimal (just a chapel) and generous\n- Made opposition to Isabel look like opposition to a pious young woman and Portugal's contributions\n\nThe room will respond to this. Let me show:\n- The toast forces everyone to commit publicly to welcoming Isabel\n- Capranica can't object without looking petty\n- The nobles see Juan's political skill and his genuine affection for Isabel\n- Isabel herself is likely moved and grateful\n\nI should narrate the room's response, particularly Capranica's reaction, and how this changes the dynamic.\n\nThe room erupted in response.\n\n\"To Her Highness!\" came the chorus, cups raised high. The Countess of Orgaz was first to her feet, followed quickly by Don Fadrique and the other Toledo nobles. The Bishop of Burgos stood, beaming. Even those who had exchanged knowing glances moments before now joined the toast with genuine warmth.\n\nIsabel's carefully composed expression cracked. Her eyes glistened as she looked up at Juan, then around the table at the raised cups. She rose gracefully, bowing her head in acknowledgment, one hand pressed to her heart.\n\n\"You honor me beyond words,\" she said quietly, her voice steady despite the emotion. \"I pledge myself to Castile, to this crusade, and to serving God alongside my husband. Thank you.\"\n\nThe applause was genuine. Several noblewomen looked genuinely moved. Don Fadrique called out, \"Castile is blessed in its Queen!\"\n\nCardinal Capranica had risen with the others for the toast, his cup raised. But his face was difficult to read—surprise, certainly, perhaps a flash of something else. As the applause died down and guests returned to their seats, he remained standing a moment longer.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he said carefully, his voice carrying that measured tone, \"speaks with the wisdom of a king and the heart of a husband. I confess...\" He paused, seeming to choose words precisely. \"I confess that my concerns, while rooted in genuine care for the crusade's spiritual character, perhaps failed to account for what Your Majesty has so eloquently described—the personal piety and devotion of the Queen herself.\"\n\nHe inclined his head toward Isabel. \"Your Highness, forgive an old churchman's excessive caution. If His Majesty testifies to your faith and devotion, that testimony carries weight.\" He raised his cup again. \"May your Portuguese traditions enrich rather than divide. May the chapel His Majesty commissions be a place of true prayer and peace.\"\n\nIt was not quite an apology, but it was acknowledgment. A retreat performed with as much dignity as possible.\n\nThe Archbishop, sensing the moment, stood as well. \"Then we are united! Portuguese and Castilian, crown and Church, all serving God's purpose. This is what crusades are meant to achieve—unity in diversity of tradition, strength in common purpose!\"\n\nThe tension that had filled the room dissipated like smoke. Conversations resumed with noticeably warmer energy. Several guests approached Isabel with compliments and welcomes. The Countess of Orgaz engaged her in conversation about chapel decoration, offering suggestions for Portuguese artisans in Castile.\n\nDona Beatriz, still standing behind Isabel's chair, allowed herself the smallest smile.\n\nAs the dinner continued and guests mingled, Capranica remained at his seat, occasionally joining conversations but noticeably quieter than before. He was cordial when addressed, but the pointed energy from earlier had vanished.\n\nLater, as the evening wound down, the Archbishop approached Juan privately. \"Your Majesty handled that masterfully. You turned His Eminence's pressure into an opportunity to demonstrate both strength and generosity.\" He lowered his voice. \"The Cardinal will not push this matter further. He cannot, after what happened tonight.\"\n\nWhat do you do or say?"

          "text": "January 28, 1431 — Morning\n\nJuan arrived at the Archbishop's palace where Capranica maintained his quarters, accompanied only by Álvaro and a single servant carrying a wrapped package. The morning was crisp, winter sunlight filtering through narrow windows as they were escorted to the Cardinal's working chambers.\n\nCapranica rose immediately when Juan entered, clearly surprised by the visit. His quarters were exactly what one might expect—meticulously organized, shelves lined with books and documents, a large desk covered in correspondence. The smell of ink and parchment hung in the air.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Capranica said, bowing deeply. \"This is... unexpected. Please, sit.\" He gestured to chairs near a small table, dismissing his own secretary with a wave.\n\nThe servant placed the package on the table as Juan and Capranica sat. Álvaro remained standing discreetly near the door.\n\nCapranica's expression was guarded—not hostile, but cautious. The man who had pressed his point so carefully last night now seemed uncertain of his footing. His hands folded on the table, fingers interlaced in that characteristic way of his.\n\n\"I must confess, Your Majesty, I did not expect a visit this morning.\" His voice was quiet, measured. \"After last evening's... discussion.\"\n\nThe package sat between them, still wrapped in fine cloth.\n\nWhat do you say or do?"

An oversight I now seek to amend. I hope my welcome gift is to your liking.\n\n\nI offer him the package to open."

The cloth fell away to reveal a wooden case, dark walnut polished to a deep shine, with brass fittings.\n\nHe opened the case.\n\nInside, nestled in velvet, lay an illuminated manuscript—clearly very old, the vellum pages thick and expertly preserved. Capranica's breath caught. His fingers hovered over it for a moment before carefully lifting it out.\n\n\"Decretum Gratiani,\" he whispered, reading the title page. His eyes widened as he turned pages with extraordinary care. \"This is... Your Majesty, this is a twelfth-century copy. Look at these illuminations—the marginalia...\" He traced a finger just above the text, not quite touching. \"This is from Bologna, the original school of canon law.\"\n\nHis voice had changed entirely—no longer the guarded bureaucrat but a scholar discovering treasure. \"The annotations... these are glosses by later canonists. This is a working copy, used for teaching.\" He looked up at Juan, genuine astonishment on his face. \"Your Majesty, this is extraordinary. How did you...?\"\n\n\"The Archbishop's library,\" Juan explained. \"When I told him I wanted a gift that would be meaningful to you, he suggested this. He said a man who has served the Church's administration for thirty-seven years would appreciate the foundations.\"\n\nCapranica carefully set the manuscript back in its case, his thin fingers trembling slightly. When he looked up, his eyes were bright.\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" He stopped, composing himself. \"I have received many gifts in my years of service. Most are... appropriate but perfunctory. This...\" He gestured to the manuscript. \"This shows understanding. Not just of my position, but of me.\"\n\nHe was quiet for a moment, then met Juan's eyes directly. \"I owe you an apology. Last night, I...\" He chose words carefully. \"I allowed my concern for proper order to become... controlling. The matter of the Queen's household was not mine to dictate. I see that now.\"\n\nHis hands rested on the manuscript case. \"You spoke last night of your wife's piety, and I believe you. I should have trusted your judgment rather than imposing my own fears.\" He paused. \"I am... not always good at distinguishing between guidance and control. It is a failing.\"\n\nWhat do you say or do?"

Both in the gift and in the... understanding.\" He straightened. \"I will not forget it. You have my word—and my service—fully and without reservation.\"\n\nThere was genuine emotion in his voice, the bureaucratic mask completely dropped. \"When I write to His Holiness, I will tell him that Castile's king is not only pious but wise. That is rarer than men know.\"\n\nHe placed his hand over the manuscript case protectively. \"Thank you, Your Majesty. Truly.\"\n\nAs Juan and Álvaro departed, Capranica remained standing by the manuscript, his expression one of genuine gratitude mixed with what might have been shame at how close he'd come to damaging an important relationship over wounded pride.\n\nOnce outside in the cold morning air, Álvaro walked beside Juan in silence for several moments before speaking quietly.\n\n\"Your Majesty handled that perfectly. The gift, the timing, the words—you gave him a way back while making the boundaries clear.\" He glanced at Juan. \"The Cardinal will be loyal now. Not because he must be, but because he wants to be. That's worth more.\"\n\nThe palace courtyard stretched before them, busy with morning activity—servants, minor nobles, merchants seeking audiences.\n\n\"We're eighteen days from the wedding,\" Álvaro noted. \"Nobles have been arriving steadily. The Mendozas, the Guzmáns, delegations from Burgos and Seville. The city is filling up.\" He paused. \"What would Your Majesty like to focus on next?\"\n\nWhat do you do or say?"

They know that the tax is coming from the papal bull and it has also been announced that the wedding will serve as the moment the specifics will be announced. Their main opposition to the crown, the infantes have been completely eleminated, but maybe another family of group will fill this gap? Thinking startegically from the viewpoint of a noble from a great house, what would they pro-actively do? Or would it be in their interest to wait and see?\n\n\nConsider this not a conversation between Alvaro and Juan, but a conversation between me the player and the Game Master."

          "text": "**Factors encouraging opposition:**\n- New tax is significant (5%)\n- Sets precedent for crown taxation authority\n- Based on actual revenue assessment (harder to evade)\n- Comes with enforcement mechanism (dual crown/church teams)\n\n**Factors discouraging opposition:**\n- Papal authority behind it (opposing = opposing Church)\n- Popular crusade enthusiasm is high\n- King has momentum and legitimacy\n- Personal service exemption offers escape route\n- Infantes gone = no clear opposition leader\n- Many nobles already committed to crusade\n\n**Strategic options for nobles:**\n\n1. **Wait and see** - Most likely for mid-tier nobles. See what the great houses do first.\n\n2. **Pre-emptive compliance** - Some ambitious nobles might publicly embrace the tax early to gain favor. \"I'm already serving personally, this is just my duty.\"\n\n3. **Coordinate resistance** - Great houses (Mendoza, Álvarez de Toledo, Guzmán) might try to present unified front for concessions, but this is risky given papal backing.\n\n4. **Legal challenges** - Dispute assessment methodology, claim traditional exemptions, argue about what counts as \"revenue\"\n\n5. **Strategic service** - Many nobles might choose personal service to avoid the tax, which actually benefits Juan (more noble participation)\n \nI see potential for subtle maneuvering among noble houses. The most strategic approach involves carefully weighing personal risk against potential political gain. No single house wants to be isolated in opposition, creating a complex diplomatic chess match where most will likely seek individual accommodations rather than open confrontation.\n\nThe nobles' tactics will focus on indirect resistance: negotiating implementation nuances, seeking personalized exemptions, and using bureaucratic channels to minimize financial impact. By framing their responses as cooperative rather than rebellious, they can protect their interests while maintaining a veneer of compliance with papal directives.\n\nThis approach transforms potential conflict into a sophisticated negotiation, where each noble house attempts to secure marginal advantages without directly challenging the fundamental mandate.\n\n[GM STRATEGIC ANALYSIS]\n\nGood question. Let's think through this from the nobles' perspective.\n\nThe Nobles' Dilemma\n\nWhy opposition is difficult:\n\nPapal authority - Opposing the tax means opposing a papal bull. That's spiritually dangerous and politically toxic given the crusade enthusiasm.\n\nNo clear leader - With the Infantes gone, there's no obvious figurehead for resistance. Who wants to be the first to stand up against a popular crusade?\n\nPopular momentum - The banner procession, recruitment success, widespread religious fervor all make opposition look unpatriotic/impious.\n\nPersonal service exemption - Many nobles will just choose to serve personally, which actually benefits Juan (more noble participation).\n\nWhy they're still concerned:\n\nPrecedent - This establishes the crown can levy direct taxes with papal backing. What's next?\n\nAssessment threat - Trained assessors examining actual revenues is terrifying for nobles used to controlling their own reporting.\n\nScale - 5% is significant, especially for houses with large estates.\n\nImplementation - Joint crown/church teams can't be easily intimidated or bribed.\n\nMost Likely Noble Strategies\n\n1. WAIT AND SEE (Most probable for 70% of nobles)\n\nDon't be the first to object\n\nLet the great houses test the waters\n\nSee how enforcement actually works\n\nQuietly assess whether personal service is cheaper than the tax\n\n2. STRATEGIC COMPLIANCE (Smart, ambitious nobles - 15%)\n\nPublicly embrace the tax early: \"Of course I support the Holy Father's crusade!\"\n\nAnnounce they're serving personally (gain reputation, avoid tax)\n\nPosition themselves as loyal supporters to gain royal favor\n\nThis actually strengthens Juan's position\n\n3. COORDINATED NEGOTIATION (Great houses - 10%)\n\nNot open opposition, but \"respectful concerns\"\n\nSeek meeting with Juan before the announcement\n\nTry to negotiate softer implementation: longer assessment period, gentler penalties for errors, more exemptions\n\nFrame it as \"ensuring fairness\" not opposing the tax\n\nKey houses: Mendoza, Guzmán, maybe Pacheco\n\n4. LEGAL/BUREAUCRATIC RESISTANCE (5% - the stubborn ones)\n\nChallenge assessment methodology\n\nClaim ancient exemptions or special privileges\n\nDispute what counts as \"revenue\" vs \"necessary expenses\"\n\nSlow-walk the process\n\nThis is where the real fights will be\n\nWho Might Lead Resistance?\n\nThe Mendoza Problem:\n\nMost powerful family in Castile\n\nPedro González de Mendoza attended Seville council, seemed receptive\n\nBut the family has massive estates, so tax burden is huge\n\nMost likely strategy: Private negotiation, not public opposition\n\nMight seek special arrangement: \"We'll contribute X amount voluntarily rather than submit to assessment\"\n\nThe Guzmán Option:\n\nPowerful in Andalusia, near Granada\n\nCould argue they're already bearing frontier defense costs\n\nMight seek exemption based on \"ongoing military service\"\n\nBut they're geographically positioned to benefit from crusade conquests, so opposing is risky\n\nCoalition of Medium Houses:\n\nMost likely source of organized resistance\n\nHouses wealthy enough that 5% hurts, but not powerful enough to negotiate individually\n\nMight petition collectively for concessions\n\nBut hard to organize without clear leader\n\nMost Probable Scenario\n\nBased on the situation, here's what I think will actually happen:\n\nBefore the announcement (now until Feb 15):\n\nGreat houses will quietly seek private audiences with Juan\n\nThey'll frame it as \"seeking clarity\" not opposing\n\nTry to negotiate softer implementation details\n\nSome will pre-emptively announce personal service to avoid the issue\n\nAt the wedding announcement:\n\nPublic reception will be muted but compliant (can't oppose in front of papal legate and banner)\n\nNobles will applaud dutifully\n\nReal negotiations happen afterward\n\nAfter the announcement:\n\nNo open rebellion, but bureaucratic resistance\n\n\"My assessment team needs more time\"\n\n\"These records are incomplete, we need to verify\"\n\nClaims of special exemptions or circumstances\n\nAppeals to the oversight committee\n\nJuan's real challenge won't be crushing opposition—it will be managing the grinding negotiation process and ensuring assessments actually happen efficiently.\n\nStrategic Opportunities for Juan\n\nMeet with great houses privately before announcement - Let them voice concerns, make minor concessions that don't undermine the policy, make them feel heard\n\nEmphasize personal service option - Frame it as the \"honorable\" choice, push nobles toward serving rather than paying\n\nStart with showcase assessments - Have friendly nobles go first, demonstrate fairness and speed\n\nUse the oversight committee - Having Capranica involved means complaints to him just get referred back to Juan\n\nLeverage popular support - If nobles resist too obviously, public opinion is against them\n\nThe Real Question\n\nDo you want to:\n\nBe proactive - Meet with great houses now, before the announcement, to manage concerns?\n\nLet them come to you - Make the announcement, then handle objections as they arise?\n\nCreate momentum - Get some nobles to publicly commit to service/payment before the announcement to establish expectation?\n\nWhat's your instinct?"

          "text": "1-10: Competitive Piety - Several great houses begin publicly announcing they'll serve personally rather than pay the tax. The Mendozas declare three sons will join the crusade. Other houses follow suit to avoid looking less devoted. This starts a competition where nobles try to out-pious each other. Juan gets both revenue from those who can't serve AND more noble participants than expected.\n\n11-15: Strategic Embrace - Led by the Mendozas, 6-8 major houses privately approach Juan offering to pay the tax early as a demonstration of support. They frame it as \"we trust Your Majesty's assessments completely.\" In return, they expect future royal favor, but they don't make it explicit. Creates excellent precedent.\n\n16-20: Religious Fervor Effect - The banner procession and popular crusade enthusiasm has genuinely moved the nobility. At a gathering before the wedding, senior nobles pledge their support publicly, with Don Fadrique of Toledo leading: \"Let it not be said that Castilian nobles valued gold over God's work.\" Others follow his lead. Tax implementation will be smooth.\n\n21-45: PRAGMATIC COMPLIANCE\n\nNobles accept the tax but seek to manage implementation to their advantage.\n\n21-30: Private Negotiation Track - The Mendozas and Guzmáns request private audiences with Juan before the announcement. They don't oppose the tax but seek \"clarification\" on assessment methodology, exemptions, and timeline. They propose some minor modifications that would benefit them but don't fundamentally undermine the policy. Respectful, businesslike.\n\n31-40: Personal Service Wave - Once a few nobles announce they'll serve personally to avoid the tax, others quickly follow. Within a week, 40+ nobles have pledged personal service. Most are genuine, some are trying to avoid assessment. Juan gains military strength but less revenue than projected. Still a win overall.\n\n41-45: Quiet Compliance with Grumbling - Nobles accept the tax is happening but complain privately to each other. They'll comply with assessments but won't be happy about it. Some minor foot-dragging on producing records, but nothing organized. The oversight committee will need to be firm but won't face serious resistance.\n\n46-65: STRATEGIC POSITIONING\n\nNobles try to shape implementation without opposing the tax directly.\n\n46-52: Counter-Proposal - A delegation of 8-10 medium-sized houses approaches Juan with a \"more efficient\" alternative: voluntary contributions rather than formal assessments. They offer to collectively contribute a fixed amount (slightly less than assessment would yield) in exchange for avoiding the assessment process. Frame it as saving administrative costs.\n\n53-58: Committee Appeal - Several houses petition Cardinal Capranica and the Archbishop, asking them to advocate for \"gentler implementation\" of the tax. They emphasize their past contributions to the Church, their poverty (exaggerated), their frontier service. Try to get the oversight committee to soften Juan's approach before the announcement.\n\n59-65: Special Exemption Campaign - Multiple nobles begin documenting claims for special exemptions: frontier service, recent economic losses, ancient privileges, family already serving in crusades. They're not opposing the tax broadly, just trying to exempt themselves specifically. Creates administrative burden but not organized resistance.\n\n66-80: COORDINATED RESISTANCE\n\nNobles organize to push back collectively, though not openly rebellious.\n\n66-71: Great House Coalition - Mendoza, Guzmán, and Pacheco families quietly coordinate. They don't oppose the tax publicly but agree to support each other's exemption claims, slow-walk assessments, and share legal strategies. They request a formal meeting with Juan, Álvaro, and Capranica to \"discuss implementation concerns.\" Present united front.\n\n72-76: Assessment Obstruction - Multiple noble houses begin \"preparing their records\" but keep finding reasons for delay. Documents are incomplete, stewards are sick, account books need verification. Not open defiance, but passive resistance that could bog down the assessment process for months unless Juan pushes hard.\n\n77-80: Legal Challenge Preparation - A group of nobles hire canon lawyers to examine the papal bull's language, looking for limitations or ambiguities. They plan to argue at the wedding announcement that certain interpretations of the tax exceed the bull's authority. Prepare formal legal objections to present to the oversight committee.\n\n81-92: SERIOUS OPPOSITION\n\nOrganized resistance that creates real political problems.\n\n81-85: Pre-Announcement Petition - Before the wedding, a formal petition signed by 25+ noble houses is presented to Juan. Respectful in tone but firm: they request the tax be reduced to 3%, assessment timeline extended to 18 months, and numerous exemption categories added. Threaten (politely) that implementation without \"consensus\" will harm realm unity during crusade.\n\n86-89: Regional Coordination - Nobles in Andalusia, led by the Guzmáns, argue they face special circumstances due to frontier position. They coordinate with Galician and León nobility to present regional objections. Not rebellion, but organized lobbying for regional exemptions that would gut the tax's effectiveness.\n\n90-92: Alternative Revenue Proposal - A sophisticated counter-proposal from major houses: instead of estate assessment, they offer to fund specific crusade expenses directly (ships, provisions, equipment). They'd pay similar total amount but avoid assessment process and maintain control. Presents Juan with difficult choice: accept reasonable alternative or fight for principle.\n\n93-100: CRISIS-LEVEL RESISTANCE\n\nSerious organized opposition that threatens the crusade's political foundation.\n\n93-95: Boycott Threat - A coalition of 15-20 significant houses privately warns (through intermediaries) that if assessments proceed as planned, they will not send their levies to the crusade. Not open rebellion, but threatening to withhold military support unless tax terms are negotiated. Forces Juan to choose between revenue and troops.\n\n96-97: Appeal to Aragon - Some nobles, feeling threatened by crown taxation precedent, quietly reach out to King Alfonso V of Aragon suggesting his brothers (the Infantes) were right about Juan's overreach. Don't openly support Infantes' return, but plant seeds. Could revive Aragonese interference if not handled carefully.\n\n98-99: Public Opposition at Wedding - Plans are made for respected nobles to voice formal objections during or immediately after the tax announcement at the wedding. In front of papal legate, gathered nobility, and public. Frame it as \"loyal concerns\" but publicly challenge royal authority. Creates spectacle and forces immediate confrontation.\n\n100: Conspiracy - A secret meeting of 12-15 major houses occurs. They don't plot rebellion but agree to collective resistance: all will refuse assessment, all will claim exemptions, all will withhold levies until terms are renegotiated. If Juan tries to force compliance with any one house, the others will support them. Coordinated, serious opposition that could fracture the crusade coalition.\n\nGM Note: Given the strong position Juan has built (papal authority, popular support, no Infantes, good relationship with Capranica), I've weighted this toward middle outcomes. But there's still meaningful chance of organized noble pushback because 5% direct taxation is genuinely unprecedented and threatening to noble power.\n\nReady to roll?"

Present were:\n- King Juan II\n- Cardinal Domenico Capranica (Papal Legate)\n- Archbishop Gutiérrez Álvarez de Toledo\n- Don Álvaro de Luna (Royal Constable)\n- Father Tommaso Parentucelli (Papal administrator)\n\n### The Budget Document\n\nAfter nine days of intensive collaboration between Álvaro and Tommaso, they produced a 47-page comprehensive campaign budget:\n\n**Key Financial Details:**\n- **Total Campaign Cost:** 143,171 florins (for 8-month season, April-November 1431)\n- **Available Treasury:** 390,200 florins (Barcelona donations, Florence donations, papal funds, Portuguese dowry, existing donations)\n- **Surplus After Campaign:** 247,029 florins before taxation revenue\n- **Force Structure:** 35,000 troops total\n  - Western Army: 12,000 (coastal conquest with naval support)\n  - Eastern Army: 23,000 (raiding, intelligence, opportunistic sieges)\n  - Noble levies (26,800) paid by lords - not in crown budget\n  - Military Orders (4,500) paid by Orders - not in crown budget\n  - Crown responsibility: ~3,700 troops (crown forces + crusaders)\n\n**Major Expense Categories:**\n- Naval operations: 53,440 florins (largest single cost - Genoese galleys, transport vessels)\n- Provisions: 45,566 florins (for all 35,000 troops)\n- Wages: 7,924 florins (crown forces and crusaders only)\n- Contingency reserve: 32,000 florins (22% buffer)\n\n**Oversight Mechanisms:**\n- Expenditures under 500 florins: field commander discretion\n- 500-2,000 florins: quartermaster approval with documentation\n- 2,000-5,000 florins: oversight committee approval\n- Over 5,000 florins: full committee plus His Majesty\n- Emergency authorization: up to 10,000 florins for genuine battlefield emergencies (limited to 3 uses)\n- Monthly and quarterly reporting requirements established\n\n### Cardinal Capranica's Assessment\n\nCapranica praised the budget as \"the most thorough campaign accounting I have encountered in thirty-seven years of Church administration.\" He noted:\n- Sound structure with clear separation of costs\n- Conservative estimates with appropriate contingencies\n- Excellent variance analysis (optimistic/conservative/pessimistic scenarios)\n- Professional-grade documentation standards\n\nThe Archbishop agreed, calling the provisions calculations and naval operations budget particularly impressive.\n\n### Formal Approval\n\nThe committee unanimously approved the budget:\n- Juan: \"As King of Castile and Supreme Commander, I say Aye\"\n- Archbishop: \"Aye\"\n- Capranica: \"As Papal Legate representing His Holiness Pope Martin V, I say Aye\"\n\nThree copies signed for crown treasury, papal records, and Rome dispatch.\n\n---\n\n## PART II: CRUSADE TAXATION DISCUSSION\n\n### The Noble Tax (5%)\n\nJuan proposed implementing the 5% crusade tax on Castilian nobility authorized by the papal bull, with key features:\n- 5% assessment on actual estate revenues\n- 2,000 maravedí exemption for nobles serving personally in crusade\n- Trained assessors to ensure accurate evaluation\n- Focus on larger estates and noble families\n\n**Rationale for Personal Service Exemption:**\n- Incentivizes noble participation in crusade\n- Protects smaller estates from impoverishment\n- Allows concentration of assessment efforts on major houses\n- Creates both military and fiscal benefits\n\n### The Church Property Tax (10%)\n\nThe papal bull authorized 10% tax on church property revenues. Discussion focused on ensuring fairness:\n- Wealthy monasteries and bishoprics can bear the burden\n- Poor parishes and struggling foundations need protection\n- Same accurate assessment process as noble estates\n- Hardship provisions for genuinely impoverished church properties\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n**Assessment Teams:**\n- 43 trained crown assessors ready for deployment\n- 27 experienced tax collectors with additional estate valuation training\n- 16 new recruits with accounting and law education\n- Training completed under Master Rodrigo de Escalona (former Archbishop of Seville administrator)\n- Joint teams: crown assessors paired with ecclesiastical observers\n\n**Cardinal Capranica's Recommendations:**\n- Provide ~12 learned clergy as ecclesiastical observers\n- Joint authority legitimizes process and prevents bias accusations\n- Begin with wealthiest estates to demonstrate tax falls on those most able to pay\n- Prioritize great houses: Mendoza, Álvarez de Toledo, Guzmán\n\n**Documentation Standards:**\n- Three copies of each assessment: estate holder, crown records, oversight committee\n- Property description, revenue sources, supporting evidence, calculated tax obligation\n- Letters of authority bearing three seals: royal, legatine, archiepiscopal\n- Right of access to estate records and account books specified\n\n**Timeline:**\n- Assessment program to begin immediately\n- 2-3 months to complete assessments across Castile\n- Revenue expected to flow June-October 1431\n- Projected revenue: 24,000-38,000 florins over 8 months\n\n### Wedding Announcement Plan\n\nJuan proposed announcing the crusade taxation at the royal wedding (February 15):\n- All nobility gathered in one place\n- Sacred setting with papal legate present\n- Banner and relics unveiled\n- Combined with crusader recruitment appeal\n\nThe announcement itself would be made public in advance so nobles know it's coming, with specific details revealed at the wedding. This allows nobles to raise concerns directly to Juan in Toledo rather than fermenting resistance in their territories.\n\n**Strategic Advantages:**\n- Nobles present to address concerns face-to-face\n- Sacred context makes resistance more difficult\n- Papal legate's presence reinforces religious authority\n- No time for coordinated opposition before public announcement\n\n---\n\n## PART III: WEDDING PLANNING DETAILS\n\n### Cardinal Capranica to Officiate\n\nJuan invited Cardinal Capranica to officiate the royal wedding. Capranica was deeply honored, calling it \"a privilege I had not anticipated\" to join in matrimony a king pledged to God's work and a princess known for devotion.\n\n**Ceremony Structure:**\n- Full High Mass with Queen's coronation (3+ hours)\n- Capranica officiating\n- Public procession through Toledo streets\n- Isabel crowned as Queen Consort during ceremony\n- Morning ceremony starting 9:00 AM\n\n### Banner and Relics\n\nThe blessed crusade banner and relics (transported from Seville) would be:\n- Hidden until wedding ceremony\n- Unveiled during Mass for first time in Toledo\n- Displayed afterward for public veneration\n- Later brought outside where crusaders assemble beneath it\n- Used for Juan's personal recruitment appeal\n- 50 crusaders to escort and guard\n\n### Painting Commission\n\nJuan decided to commission a major commemorative painting of the wedding, capturing:\n- Papal legate's blessing\n- The banner and relics\n- Juan's sword\n- The papal bull\n- Most important nobles present\n- All spiritual elements of the moment\n\n**Decision:** Rather than rush the work, commission Italian or Flemish master to work next winter (1431-32) when Juan returns to Toledo. This allows:\n- Master to work from actual cathedral setting\n- Juan and Isabel to pose properly\n- Witnesses to describe ceremony for accuracy\n- Artistic vision combined with historical authenticity\n- Time to know first campaign season outcome\n\nTommaso to reach out to multiple painters (Fra Angelico if available, Flemish masters) for proposals by summer. Contract by autumn, work through winter.\n\n### Papal Letters to Foreign Kingdoms\n\nCapranica brought letters from Pope Martin V to several monarchs (France, England, Holy Roman Emperor, Hungary, Poland) announcing the crusade and requesting support.\n\n**Decision:** Wait to send letters until after first campaign season (autumn 1431). Rationale:\n- Letters announcing proclaimed crusade invite polite acknowledgment\n- Letters announcing victorious crusade invite genuine interest and contributions\n- Demonstrates Castilian strength - not begging for aid but inviting others to join success\n- Juan has sufficient funds for several seasons without foreign donations\n\nCapranica agreed this was superior strategy and would hold letters until victories can be reported.\n\n---\n\n## PART IV: THE PORTUGUESE LADIES CRISIS (January 24)\n\n### The Demand\n\nLate afternoon on January 24, Isabel came to Juan in distress. Cardinal Capranica had requested an audience that morning and told her:\n- Her Portuguese attendants were \"unsuitable\" for Queen of Castile during holy crusade\n- She should be attended by Spanish women of \"proven piety and devotion\"\n- He had already identified appropriate ladies: daughters of Toledo families, Archbishop's niece, someone from Mendoza household\n- Portuguese customs might not align with Castilian expectations\n- As Papal Legate with responsibility for crusade's spiritual character, this was necessary\n- She must dismiss Dona Beatriz and her other Portuguese ladies before the wedding\n\n**Isabel's Distress:**\nIsabel was confused and hurt. The three Portuguese ladies (Dona Beatriz, Dona Inês, Dona Catarina) had been with her since childhood, sailed with her from Portugal, and were all she had that felt like home.\n\nCapranica had been \"very firm\" and told Isabel this was \"not negotiable\" as it fell under his spiritual oversight authority. He seemed surprised when Isabel said she needed to discuss it with Juan, suggesting it was household management not requiring the King's involvement.\n\n### Investigation and Council\n\n**Juan's Response:**\nJuan immediately reassured Isabel he would handle it and that her ladies would not be sent home.\n\n**Meeting with Dona Beatriz:**\nDona Beatriz (age ~40, dignified, from old Portuguese noble house) explained her interaction with Capranica:\n- Previous day, he questioned her about Portuguese customs\n- Asked about feast days, prayers, whether they followed Portuguese or Roman breviary\n- She explained they follow Roman breviary but observe Portuguese traditional devotions\n- Particularly mentioned devotion to Our Lady of the Conception (Immaculate Conception)\n- And Portuguese holy days: feast of Saint Vincent, commemoration of Battle of Aljubarrota\n- Capranica seemed concerned about \"divided spiritual loyalties\" weakening the crusade\n\n**Emergency Council:**\nJuan convened all relevant parties in his chambers:\n- Isabel and her three Portuguese ladies\n- Álvaro de Luna\n- Fray Hernando de Talavera (royal confessor)\n- Three guards from Juan's personal retinue (Rodrigo Sánchez and two others)\n\n**Fray Hernando's Assessment:**\nAfter questioning the Portuguese ladies about their faith practices, Hernando concluded:\n- Immaculate Conception is disputed among theologians but not heresy\n- Portuguese feast days honoring their own saints and victories are custom, not doctrine\n- All their prayers and devotions are properly Catholic\n- Nothing contradicts Catholic faith or proper Christian devotion\n- No justification for dismissal on grounds of insufficient piety\n\n**The Real Motive:**\nThrough discussion, the group concluded Capranica's real concern wasn't spiritual:\n- **Power and Control:** By dismissing Portuguese ladies and replacing them with Spanish women he selected, Capranica would place four noble families in his debt\n- **Intelligence Network:** Those families' daughters would observe, listen, report back - not to Juan but to their families who owe Capranica favor\n- **Removing Independent Voices:** Portuguese ladies are loyal to Isabel, not to Castilian noble houses or to Capranica\n- **Testing Boundaries:** Seeing what authority Juan will allow him to claim beyond what the papal bull grants\n\n**Legal Authority:**\nFray Hernando confirmed that the papal bull *Inter Cetera Divinae* grants the Papal Legate no authority over royal household management. This is secular governance, firmly within the King's authority. Capranica has no legal basis for the demand.\n\n### Juan's Strategy\n\n**The Plan:**\nJuan decided on strategic passive resistance rather than direct confrontation:\n1. **Ignore the demand:** Capranica never approached Juan directly (as he should have)\n2. **Act innocent:** Ladies simply continue their duties, claiming no order from the King to leave\n3. **Guard protection:** Rodrigo Sánchez and two trusted guards assigned to protect Isabel and her ladies\n4. **Letter of authority:** Álvaro to draft document establishing crown protection and household authority\n5. **If challenged:** Guards refer anyone to the King, remain polite but firm\n\n**Instructions to Guards:**\n- Portuguese ladies under crown protection\n- No one removes them without Juan's direct written order\n- Be polite and firm even if cardinal, archbishop, or nobles try to overrule\n- Represent crown authority\n- Refer all questions directly to the King\n\n**If Capranica Raises It Formally:**\nJuan will frame it as \"misunderstanding\" - he heard rumors but received no official request. Surely the Cardinal would never overstep his authority in such a manner, especially against the Portuguese whose crown contributed so substantially to the crusade (putting their piety beyond doubt). If Capranica wants to raise it formally, Juan will hear his petition with \"all the grace and respect it deserves\" before dismissing it.\n\n**Public Visibility Plan:**\nÁlvaro suggested making Portuguese ladies very publicly visible at next day's chapel service - attending Isabel, praying devoutly. Make clear they are here, proper, and under crown protection.\n\n---\n\n## PART V: PUBLIC PRESSURE AT DINNER (January 27)\n\n### The Setting\n\nThree days after the Portuguese ladies incident, Archbishop Gutiérrez hosted a formal dinner at his palace for Toledo's prominent families. Ostensibly celebrating the upcoming wedding, but functionally integrating Juan and Isabel into Toledo's aristocratic society.\n\n**Attendees (24 guests):**\n- Heads of great Toledo families\n- Several bishops including Bishop of Burgos\n- Master of the Order of Santiago (arrived that morning)\n- Cardinal Capranica\n\n**The Portuguese Ladies:**\nDona Beatriz stood visibly behind Isabel's chair, proper and fulfilling her duties. Isabel wore the Portuguese ladies at court openly, following Juan's strategy.\n\n### Capranica's Move\n\nAfter the Archbishop's toast to the crusade, Capranica requested to add \"a thought\" and remained standing:\n\n**His Speech (paraphrased):**\n- Crusade represents spiritual unity, not just military conquest\n- Holy Father chose Castile because of purity and strength of Spanish Catholic tradition\n- Spain stood as Christendom's bulwark for 8 centuries while others wavered\n- Unity of purpose and tradition becomes essential in such endeavors\n- \"Foreign customs, however well-intentioned, can create subtle divisions. Small cracks in the foundation.\"\n- Blessed traditions of Castile - its prayers, feast days, way of honoring God - make crusade possible\n- Should be preserved, protected, celebrated\n- Pope himself remarked that Spain's strength comes from its distinctive character\n- \"Its refusal to dilute its faith with outside influences\"\n- \"How fortunate we are that Spain has always understood this principle\"\n\n**The Implication:**\nClear reference to Portuguese ladies without naming them directly. Several guests glanced toward Isabel and Dona Beatriz. Some exchanged knowing looks.\n\n**Countess of Orgaz's Response:**\nTried to defend: \"Surely the alliance with Portugal strengthens the crusade? Their ships, their dowry...\"\n\n**Capranica's Reply:**\n\"Absolutely! Portugal's material contributions invaluable. King João is faithful son of the Church. I speak only of importance of maintaining spiritual... consistency. Especially in matters close to the throne, where influence is greatest.\" Then dismissively: \"But these are merely musings of an old papal bureaucrat.\"\n\nThe table went quiet. The Archbishop looked uncomfortable. Several nobles were clearly processing. Isabel's face was composed but her hand pressed flat on the table.\n\nDon Fadrique of Toledo tried to help: \"The Queen-to-be honors us with her presence and devotion.\"\n\nCapranica agreed but the compliment made the earlier implications sharper.\n\n### Juan's Masterful Response\n\nJuan stood and delivered a powerful speech:\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Thanked Capranica for his contributions and excellent working relationship\n- Acknowledged Capranica's point about concerns regarding the arranged marriage\n- **Personal testimony:** When he learned Isabel was coming, he worried - would their beliefs and traditions conflict?\n- Would Isabel be willing to follow him in faith as a wife should follow her husband?\n- **Discovery of Isabel's character:** As he got to know her, they found faith was their greatest common joy and interest\n- Isabel is devout and pious, takes her responsibility as future queen extremely seriously, especially in matters of faith\n- She is determined and will pray daily for him and the entire kingdom\n- **\"I have fallen in love with her\"**\n- Her traditions are different but she prays with such conviction he has found beauty in them\n- \"I am Castilian by blood and faith, but I will always respect Isabel and her blood and roots as well\"\n- Portugal has demonstrated commitment to union and crusade - would be improper not to repay their faith in kind\n- **Announcement:** Will commission a chapel decorated in Portuguese style and tradition where Isabel can find peace in this foreign land\n\n**The Toast:**\n\"I ask you all to join me in welcoming Isabel to Castile and to this court. That she may find root and familiarity here. Isabel my love, a toast to you!\"\n\n**The Room's Reaction:**\n- Erupted in enthusiastic response\n- Countess of Orgaz first to her feet, followed by Don Fadrique and others\n- Even those who had been sympathetic to Capranica joined warmly\n- Isabel emotional, eyes glistening, bowing her head in acknowledgment\n- Genuine applause, several noblewomen moved\n- Don Fadrique: \"Castile is blessed in its Queen!\"\n\n### Capranica's Retreat\n\nCapranica rose for the toast but his face was difficult to read - surprise, perhaps something else. After applause died, he remained standing:\n\n**His Response:**\n\"Your Majesty speaks with wisdom of a king and heart of a husband. I confess... my concerns, while rooted in genuine care for crusade's spiritual character, perhaps failed to account for what Your Majesty so eloquently described - the personal piety and devotion of the Queen herself.\"\n\nInclined head to Isabel: \"Your Highness, forgive an old churchman's excessive caution. If His Majesty testifies to your faith and devotion, that testimony carries weight.\"\n\nRaised cup: \"May your Portuguese traditions enrich rather than divide. May the chapel His Majesty commissions be a place of true prayer and peace.\"\n\n**Not quite an apology, but acknowledgment and retreat performed with dignity.**\n\nThe Archbishop reinforced the moment: \"Then we are united! Portuguese and Castilian, crown and Church, all serving God's purpose. This is what crusades are meant to achieve!\"\n\nTension dissipated. Conversations resumed with warmer energy. Several guests approached Isabel with compliments. Countess of Orgaz discussed chapel decoration with her.\n\nDona Beatriz allowed herself the smallest smile.\n\nCapranica remained cordial but noticeably quieter for the rest of the evening.\n\n### Private Assessment\n\nLater, the Archbishop told Juan privately: \"Your Majesty handled that masterfully. You turned His Eminence's pressure into opportunity to demonstrate both strength and generosity. The Cardinal will not push this matter further. He cannot, after what happened tonight.\"\n\n---\n\n## PART VI: RECONCILIATION WITH CAPRANICA (January 28, Morning)\n\n### The Gift\n\nThe morning after the dinner, Juan visited Capranica at the Archbishop's palace. Accompanied only by Álvaro and a servant carrying a wrapped package.\n\nCapranica was surprised by the visit. His quarters were meticulously organized - shelves of books and documents, desk covered in correspondence, smell of ink and parchment.\n\n**Capranica's Uncertainty:**\nHe seemed guarded, uncertain after the previous night's public retreat. \"I must confess, Your Majesty, I did not expect a visit this morning. After last evening's... discussion.\"\n\n**Juan's Approach:**\n- Praised Capranica's genuine contributions: \"Some call flattery cheap, but I actually meant what I said\"\n- Acknowledged the commitment to making the partnership work\n- Recognized the tension from the previous night\n- Framed the gift as correcting an oversight: \"I have been a bad host for not offering you a welcome gift\"\n\n### The Manuscript\n\nJuan presented Capranica with an illuminated manuscript in a polished walnut case with brass fittings.\n\n**The Gift:** *Decretum Gratiani* - a twelfth-century copy from Bologna, the original school of canon law. The manuscript included:\n- Extraordinary illuminations\n- Extensive marginalia with glosses by later canonists\n- Working copy used for teaching\n- Exceptional historical and scholarly value\n\n**Capranica's Reaction:**\nGenuine astonishment and emotion. His voice changed from guarded bureaucrat to scholar discovering treasure:\n- Recognized the manuscript's origin and significance immediately\n- Traced the illuminations and annotations with reverence\n- \"Your Majesty, this is extraordinary. How did you...?\"\n- When told the Archbishop suggested it, said: \"This shows understanding. Not just of my position, but of *me*.\"\n\nHis hands trembled as he set it back in its case. Eyes bright.\n\n\"I have received many gifts in my years of service. Most are appropriate but perfunctory. This... this shows understanding.\"\n\n### The Apology\n\nCapranica looked directly at Juan: \"I owe you an apology. Last night, I... I allowed my concern for proper order to become... controlling. The matter of the Queen's household was not mine to dictate. I see that now.\"\n\nHis hands rested on the manuscript case. \"You spoke last night of your wife's piety, and I believe you. I should have trusted your judgment rather than imposing my own fears.\"\n\nPause. \"I am... not always good at distinguishing between guidance and control. It is a failing.\"\n\n**Juan's Grace:**\n\"Speak of it no more, father. The success of our crusade hinges in part on our successful cooperation. Let me stress that I am at your disposal at every moment should you require me. You always have access to me and I assure you that you always have my ear as well.\"\n\n\"I hope we can leave any perceived tension behind us and focus on our holy task together.\"\n\n### Restored Partnership\n\nCapranica stood and bowed deeply - deeper than protocol required.\n\n\"Your Majesty has shown me great grace today. Both in the gift and in the understanding. I will not forget it. You have my word - and my service - fully and without reservation.\"\n\nGenuine emotion in his voice. \"When I write to His Holiness, I will tell him that Castile's king is not only pious but wise. That is rarer than men know.\"\n\n**Result:** The Cardinal will now be loyal not because he must be, but because he wants to be. The relationship, though tested, has emerged stronger and more authentic.\n\n---\n\n## PART VII: NOBLE RESPONSE TO TAXATION\n\n### Strategic Analysis\n\nWith 18 days until the wedding, Juan and Álvaro assessed how the nobility would respond to the coming crusade taxation announcement.\n\n**Noble Dilemma:**\n- Papal authority makes opposition spiritually dangerous and politically toxic\n- No clear leader for resistance with Infantes eliminated\n- Popular crusade enthusiasm makes opposition look unpatriotic/impious\n- Personal service exemption provides honorable alternative\n- But 5% is significant and assessment process is threatening\n\n**Roll Result: 45 - Quiet Compliance with Grumbling**\n\nThe nobility will accept the tax but complain privately to each other. They'll comply with assessments but won't be happy about it. Some minor foot-dragging on producing records expected, but nothing organized. The oversight committee will need to be firm but won't face serious resistance.\n\n**What This Means:**\n- No open rebellion or organized opposition\n- Private meetings with great houses seeking \"clarification\"\n- Some bureaucratic resistance and delay tactics\n- Appeals to oversight committee on specific cases\n- Overall manageable implementation\n\n### Preparation for Wedding\n\n**Next 18 Days (Jan 28 - Feb 15):**\n1. Toledo fills with arriving nobles from all great houses\n2. Assessment teams finalized, letters of authority prepared\n3. Cathedral arrangements and liturgy planning with Capranica\n4. Portuguese chapel remodeling begins\n5. Crusader recruitment continues - approaching 200 sworn crusaders\n6. Isabel grows more confident, Portuguese ladies visibly integrated\n7. A few great houses (Mendoza, Guzmán) request private audiences to seek \"clarity\" on tax details\n\n---\n\n## STATUS SUMMARY (End of Chapter 11)\n\n**Date:** January 28, 1431  \n**Location:** Toledo\n\n**Treasury Status:**\n- Available funds: 390,200 florins\n- Approved campaign budget: 143,171 florins\n- Projected surplus: 247,029 florins (before taxation revenue)\n- Expected taxation revenue: 24,000-38,000 florins (8 months)\n\n**Military Preparations:**\n- Sworn crusaders: ~200 (growing)\n- Assessment teams: 43 crown assessors ready\n- Ecclesiastical observers: ~12 to be provided by Capranica\n- Campaign forces planned: 35,000 troops\n- Naval contracts: Ready to finalize (Genoese galleys, transport vessels)\n\n**Political Situation:**\n- Budget approved unanimously by oversight committee\n- Cardinal Capranica relationship: Tested but strengthened\n- Portuguese ladies crisis: Resolved in Juan's favor\n- Isabel integration: Successful and growing confident\n- Noble response to taxation: Manageable (quiet compliance expected)\n- Great houses arriving in Toledo for wedding\n\n**Wedding Plans (February 15):**\n- Cardinal Capranica officiating\n- Full High Mass with Queen's coronation (3+ hours)\n- Banner and relics to be unveiled\n- Taxation announcement to be made\n- Crusader recruitment appeal\n- Commemorative painting commissioned (for next winter)\n\n**Key Relationships:**\n- Capranica: Loyal and committed after reconciliation\n- Isabel: Trusting and confident, supported by Portuguese ladies\n- Álvaro: Essential partner in administration\n- Tommaso: Strong working relationship established\n- Great houses: Cautious but compliant\n- Popular support: Strong and growing\n\n---\n\n## THEMES AND LESSONS\n\n### Managing Authority Boundaries\n\nThe Portuguese ladies crisis demonstrated the importance of:\n- Knowing the limits of others' authority (papal bull granted no household control)\n- Strategic passive resistance vs. direct confrontation\n- Leaving face-saving exit routes for opponents\n- Protecting what matters while avoiding unnecessary fights\n\nJuan established that household management is royal prerogative without creating permanent enemy of Capranica.\n\n### Building Strong Partnerships\n\nThe Álvaro-Tommaso collaboration and Juan-Capranica reconciliation showed:\n- Professional excellence transcends personal differences\n- Thoughtful gestures build genuine loyalty\n- Addressing concerns directly prevents festering resentment\n- Good administration enables rather than constrains bold action\n\n### Political Theater\n\nThe dinner speech and wedding plans demonstrate:\n- Public settings create pressure for acceptable behavior\n- Personal testimony carries more weight than abstract arguments\n- Strategic vulnerability (admitting worries, professing love) builds support\n- Combining sacred and political elements multiplies effectiveness\n\n### Preparation and Process\n\nThe budget approval and taxation framework revealed:\n- Thorough preparation builds credibility and trust\n- Clear processes protect against abuse while enabling action\n- Oversight mechanisms should serve rather than hinder operations\n- Documentation creates accountability without paralysis\n\n---\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD TO CHAPTER 12\n\n**Immediate Challenges:**\n- Private meetings with great houses before wedding\n- Final wedding preparations and rehearsals\n- Managing arriving nobles and their concerns\n- Taxation announcement at wedding\n- Crusader recruitment surge expected\n- Consummation and beginning of married life\n\n**Strategic Position:**\nJuan enters the wedding from position of strength:\n- Treasury fully funded\n- Budget approved with oversight\n- Cardinal relationship repaired and strengthened\n- Popular support strong\n- Noble opposition manageable\n- Isabel integrated and confident\n\nThe wedding represents the culmination of months of careful preparation and the launching point for the greatest crusade campaign in generations.\n\n---\n\n**END OF CHAPTER 11**\n\nPerfect!
