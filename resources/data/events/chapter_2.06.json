      "summary": "Juan continues his deep confession with Fray Hernando in the merchant's house study in Basel. Moving beyond abstract sins of pride and presumption, Juan begins to examine the spiritual mechanism by which he used the righteousness of the crusade as a shield against examining his conscience. Hernando recognizes this as genuine progress and encourages Juan to move from philosophical self-analysis to naming specific acts, identifying the 'comfort of pre-absolution' as the core spiritual disease.",

          "text": "Thought process\n\nThe user is starting Chapter 2.6 and indicates they're in the middle of a profound discussion with Fray Hernando. I need to:\n\n1. Read the CHARACTER_DATABASE.md to understand current character states\n2. Search project knowledge for the most recent chapter summary to understand where we left off\n3. Continue the conversation with Fray Hernando appropriately\n\nLet me start by reading the character database, then search for Chapter 2.5 summary to see where we are in the conversation.\n\nI'll prepare to continue your discussion with Fray Hernando. Let me first check the character database and review where Chapter 2.5 left off.\n\nPerfect! I can see exactly where we left off. Chapter 2.5 ended with Fray Hernando asking Juan the crucial question: \"What sins have you been carrying? What specific things weigh on your conscience that you never confessed to the Pope because there was no opportunity for true confession?\"\n\nJuan needs to provide his true confession - the specific sins he's been carrying since Rome. This is the breakthrough moment where he finally gets to name what's been weighing on his soul.\n\nThe key context is:\n- Juan received a hollow, formulaic absolution from Pope Martin V in Rome without real confession\n- He's been spiritually starving ever since\n- Hernando just realized he's been critiquing Juan's \"table manners\" while refusing to feed him\n- The pattern makes sense now: Juan's been trying to earn through works what should come through grace\n- This is the moment for genuine confession and genuine absolution\n\nI should pick up right at that moment - Hernando has asked the question, and now Juan must answer. This should be a powerful, vulnerable moment where Juan finally names his specific sins.\n\nI'll continue from where Fray Hernando asked: \"What sins have you been carrying? What specific things weigh on your conscience that you never confessed to the Pope because there was no opportunity for true confession?\"\n\nThe merchant's house study felt smaller than it had moments before. Shadows pooled in the corners as afternoon light slanted through the narrow window. Fray Hernando sat motionless, his weathered hands folded in his lap, eyes steady on Juan's face.\n\nThe question hung in the air between them like something physical. Not accusing. Not impatient. Simply... there. Waiting.\n\nJuan opened his mouth. Closed it. His hands gripped the arms of his chair—the same posture he'd held while Hernando had spoken of spiritual starvation, of formulas without relationship, of souls that needed feeding and not critique.\n\n\"I don't...\" He stopped. Started again. \"There are so many small things, Fray. The daily failures. Impatience with servants. Sharp words spoken in frustration. Taking credit for victories that belonged to God, or to better men than myself.\"\n\nHernando said nothing. His silence was not the harsh interrogation of earlier days, but something gentler. An open door. An invitation to go deeper.\n\nJuan's throat tightened. \"But those aren't what I've been carrying, are they? Not really. Those are... those are the surface. The things I could confess to any priest on any Sunday and receive absolution and go about my day feeling properly shriven.\"\n\nHe stood abruptly, moving to the window. The city of Basel spread below—cathedral spires, merchant houses, banners of a dozen nations. The visible machinery of Christendom struggling with itself.\n\n\"In Rome...\" His voice came quieter now. \"When I stripped before the Holy Father, when I offered everything... it was real, Fray. I meant every word. But there was also...\" He pressed his palm against the stone window frame. \"There was also theater in it. Performance. I knew—God help me, I knew—that what I was doing was extraordinary. That it would be remembered. That men would speak of the young king who came naked before the Vicar of Christ.\"\n\nHe turned back to face Hernando. \"Is that a sin? To do a holy thing while also being aware that it will seem holy to others? To mean your devotion genuinely while simultaneously knowing that your devotion serves your purposes?\"\n\nHernando's expression remained neutral, but something in his eyes encouraged continuation.\n\n\"And then,\" Juan continued, his voice gaining strength born of desperation to finally speak these things aloud, \"then there was Isabel Ruiz.\""

          "text": "Ah, I need to use the project knowledge search tool instead.\n\n1. He's confessing that his sins are not concrete actions like adultery, lying, stealing\n2. His sins are pride, presumption, and other sins that can hide in good intentions\n3. He's made many choices that determined lives - many died or were wounded\n4. He did it in the name of the Lord, and took comfort in knowing he'd be forgiven OR that the cause was just (or both)\n5. He ran the kingdom, dealt with rebels - knew these choices were \"good\" or at least any sins would be forgiven\n6. He's asking: Has he been hiding behind the crusade banner to hide his sin?\n\nThis is Juan finally getting at something real. He's acknowledging:\n- The comfort of having a crusade banner that makes everything justified\n- The psychological convenience of knowing you'll be forgiven\n- The way \"just cause\" can become a shield against genuine examination\n- The deaths he's responsible for\n\nFray Hernando's response needs to:\n1. Acknowledge this is genuine progress - Juan is touching something real\n2. But also challenge whether this is complete - is Juan still performing even in confession?\n3. Address the theological question about hiding behind justifications\n4. Not give easy absolution but also not be unnecessarily harsh\n5. Guide Juan toward deeper honesty\n\nThe roll should determine how Hernando responds - whether he sees this as genuine breakthrough or another sophisticated dodge. Let me think about the factors:\n\nSuccess Factors (reasons to accept this as progress):\n- Juan is acknowledging psychological mechanisms (comfort in knowing he'd be forgiven)\n- He's questioning whether he's been hiding behind the crusade\n- He's not just listing sins but examining his relationship to sin\n- He's making connections between pride and \"good intentions\"\n- He's acknowledging the weight of deaths\n\nFailure Factors (reasons to be skeptical):\n- This is still somewhat abstract - \"pride, presumption\" rather than specific acts\n- He's still emphasizing that choices were \"good\" even while questioning\n\n- The phrase \"any sins coming from them would be forgiven\" suggests he was already pre-absolving himself\n- He's asking Hernando to tell him if he's been hiding - not confessing that he WAS hiding\n- Pattern continues: beautiful self-examination that might still be performance\n\nI see a subtle psychological defense mechanism. Juan's confession appears profound, but he's still maintaining distance from genuine accountability. He frames his potential sins as philosophical questions rather than admitting direct responsibility. The language reveals a sophisticated avoidance - asking to be told about his hiding, instead of declaring his own hidden motivations.\n\n71/100 - that's in the \"Encouraged - Real breakthrough, guides deeper\" range. Hernando sees genuine honesty here and recognizes this as progress, but will guide Juan to go even deeper into specificity. This is the right tone for where we are - Hernando should acknowledge the breakthrough while helping Juan move from abstract self-examination to concrete confession.\n\nD100 Table: Fray Hernando's Response to Juan's Confession\n\nRoll Range\nResult\n1-25\nSkeptical Performance - \"You speak beautifully of hiding behind banners, Your Majesty. But you still hide. You ask me to tell you if you've been hiding - which means you're not confessing that you have been hiding. Name the specific acts. Not abstractions about pride. Not philosophical questions. What did you do that weighs on you?\"\n26-50\nCautious Progress - \"This is closer, Your Majesty. You're beginning to see the mechanism - how righteous cause becomes convenient shield. But you speak of 'choices' and 'weight' without naming them. And you still protect yourself: 'these choices were good, or at least would be forgiven.' Which men died by your command? Which specific decisions haunt you?\"\n51-75\nEncouraged Breakthrough - \"Yes. Yes. This is what I've been waiting to hear. Not elegant self-analysis but honest recognition: 'I took comfort in knowing I'd be forgiven.' That comfort - that certainty of absolution before acting - that is the spiritual disease. The crusade banner didn't just inspire holiness, it excused examination. But now... tell me the specific acts this comfort permitted.\"\n76-100\nMoved Recognition - Long silence. Hernando's eyes glisten slightly. \"Your Majesty, you have just confessed something more true than anything you've said since we met in Basel. Not because it's the worst sin, but because it's honest about the mechanism. The righteous cause that makes pre-absolution feel safe. Now - now we can do real work. Tell me what that comfort permitted you to do.\"\n\nRoll: 71/100 - Encouraged Breakthrough\n\nFray Hernando leaned forward slightly, his weathered hands unfolding. For the first time since their reunion in Basel, something in his face softened - not into easy approval, but into recognition.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said quietly. \"Yes. This is what I've been waiting to hear.\"\n\nHe stood and moved to the window where Juan had stood moments before, looking out at the divided city. When he spoke again, his voice carried not accusation but understanding.\n\n\"Not elegant self-analysis, Your Majesty. Not philosophical questions about whether you've been hiding. But honest recognition: 'I took comfort in knowing I'd be forgiven.' That comfort - that certainty of absolution before acting - that is the spiritual disease.\"\n\nHe turned back to face Juan. \"The crusade banner didn't just inspire holiness. It excused examination. Every death, every hard choice, every moment when you might have paused to ask 'Is this right?' - the banner answered before you could question. Of course it's right. God blessed this cause. The Pope blessed this cause. Any sins will be forgiven because the cause is just.\"\n\nHernando moved back to his chair but didn't sit. He stood beside it, one hand resting on its back.\n\n\"That comfort is poison, Your Majesty. Not because the cause was unjust - the Reconquista was just. But because that certainty made you God's instrument in your own mind before you ever asked God if He wanted you to be His instrument. It made examination feel... unnecessary. Wasteful. Perhaps even faithless.\"\n\nHe paused, studying Juan's face. \"You ask me if you've been hiding behind the crusade banner. I think you already know the answer. You wouldn't ask the question if some part of you didn't recognize the truth of it. But knowing the mechanism is not the same as confessing the acts.\"\n\nFray Hernando sat now, deliberately, slowly. Not the harsh interrogator of recent days but something gentler. A physician who has finally found the wound.\n\n\"So now - now we can do real work. Not abstract examinations of pride and presumption, but concrete acts. What did that comfort permit you to do? Which specific decisions did you make more easily because you knew they would be forgiven? Which deaths sit on your soul not because they were wrong, but because you didn't grieve them properly - because the banner made grief feel... unnecessary?\"\n\nHe waited, patient in a way he hadn't been before. The question hung in the air, but it was an invitation rather than a demand."

          "text": "This last part is crucial - Juan is still seeking reassurance. Still looking for validation that the banner makes it okay. That's the mechanism still operating.\n\nLet me consult the NPC guide principles:\n\nFrom Part 1: Universal Psychology\n- Identity protection\n- Loss aversion\n- Self-interest\n- Face/status\n- In-group loyalty\n- Sunk costs\n\nThis is about sunk costs particularly - \"their deaths must not have been for nothing\" is classic sunk cost thinking. Juan needs the crusade to have been worth it to justify all the deaths.\n\nFrom the guide on d100 tables:\n- The roll determines HOW the approach lands, not whether objective reality changes\n- Success factors persist across all ranges\n- Failure factors persist across all ranges\n- Dynamic range setting based on approach quality\n\nJuan's \"approach\" here is his confession. Quality assessment:\n- STRENGTHS: Specific acts named, genuine emotion, recognition of using banner as shield, not trying to justify\n- WEAKNESSES: Still seeking reassurance at the end, still asking Fray to validate that it was worth it, showing he hasn't fully let go of the comfort\n\nThis is a GOOD confession - much better than abstractions. But it ends with him still seeking the comfort: \"must not have been for nothing, right?\"\n\nSuccess factors (things that are true regardless of roll):\n- Juan is naming specific acts, not abstractions\n- Shows genuine grief about the young soldier\n\n- Recognizes he used the banner to avoid examination\n- Admits he didn't grieve properly\n\nI see Juan's internal struggle clearly. He's confronting his past actions with raw honesty, yet still clinging to a need for external validation. His confession reveals a deep psychological mechanism of self-protection, where he wants to believe the suffering had meaning. By admitting he used the banner as a shield and acknowledging his incomplete grief, Juan is taking crucial steps toward genuine self-reflection, even if he hasn't fully released his need for reassurance.\n\nThe potential responses range from confrontational to compassionate, depending on the emotional depth of his acknowledgment. Each level of response targets his underlying pattern of seeking justification, with increasing gentleness and insight into his psychological defense mechanisms.\n\nD100 Table: Fray Hernando's Response to Juan's Specific Confession\n\nRoll Range\nResult\n1-30\nHarsh Confrontation - \"And there it is. After naming all those deaths, after speaking their suffering - you end by asking me to reassure you that it was worth it. 'Must not have been for nothing, right Fray?' You're doing it again, Your Majesty. Seeking comfort. Seeking validation. The banner made you feel justified - and now you want me to be your banner. I will not. Those men are dead. Their suffering was real. Whether their deaths 'meant something' does not erase your responsibility for examining each decision as it came, not after counting the bodies.\"\n31-60\nChallenging Progress - \"Your Majesty, you have just named real acts. Real men. Real grief. This is confession, not philosophy. But then you asked me to tell you it was worth it - 'must not have been for nothing, right?' Do you see? Even now, even after recognizing how the banner gave you comfort, you seek that same comfort from me. You want me to say 'yes, their deaths had meaning, you were right.' But that is still hiding. Their deaths have whatever meaning God gives them, not whatever meaning makes you feel better about ordering them forward.\"\n61-85\nEncouraged Recognition - Hernando's expression shifts - pain mixed with relief. \"Yes. These are the acts. The wounded you left behind. The boy at Loja. The numbers in reports. This is confession - naming what was done, not defending why it had to be done.\" He pauses. \"But then you asked me to reassure you. 'Must not have been for nothing, right Fray?' That question... that is you still seeking the comfort. Still wanting someone to tell you it was all justified. I cannot give you that comfort, Your Majesty. What I can give you is this: You carry real weight. Not abstract pride, but specific men who died by your command. That is kingship's burden - and you cannot set it down by being reassured it was worth it.\"\n86-100\nDeeply Moved - Hernando closes his eyes briefly, and when he opens them they glisten. \"Your Majesty... you have just confessed true things. Not 'sins of pride' but actual men. The wounded in the ambush whose names you never learned. The dying boy at Loja who thought he'd won. The hundreds reduced to numbers.\" His voice roughens. \"This is what I have been waiting for. Not elegant self-examination but grief.\" He leans forward. \"And then you asked me - 'must not have been for nothing, right?' - and I see that you're still seeking it. Still wanting to be told their deaths were justified. But that question itself reveals the wound: you need their deaths to mean something because carrying the weight without justification is unbearable.

          "text": "1. **Context from Chapter 2.5**: Fray Hernando explicitly recognized he had been too harsh. He said:\n   - \"I fear I have contributed to this exhaustion. In my concern for your soul, I have been relentless, harsh, unyielding.\"\n   - He admitted he might be reacting from fear rather than pastoral discernment\n   - They agreed to a new dynamic: \"Walk not as pleasant leisure, not as unceasing examination, but as two men both trying to discern God's will\"\n   - Hernando conceded: \"Perhaps Hernando's fear making him harsh taskmaster rather than wise guide\"\n\n2. **What just happened**: Juan made a MAJOR breakthrough:\n   - Moved from abstract \"sins of pride\" to specific acts\n   - Named actual men: wounded left behind, the dying boy at Loja, the hundreds as numbers\n   - Showed real grief and vulnerability\n   - Admitted he took comfort in knowing he'd be forgiven\n   - This is exactly what Hernando has been waiting for\n\n3. **The user's point about the ending**: Juan asked \"must not have been for nothing, right Fray?\" - and I interpreted this as seeking validation/comfort. But let me reconsider:\n   - Juan has just poured out his heart\n   - He's naming specific deaths that haunt him\n   - The question could be interpreted as genuine spiritual anguish, not manipulation\n   - After such vulnerable confession, a harsh response would be pastorally inappropriate\n\n4. **Historical confessional practice**: \n   - Confessors are supposed to provide spiritual comfort and guidance\n   - Once sincere contrition is shown, the role is to provide absolution and counsel\n   - Constant harshness after genuine confession is NOT standard practice\n   - The point of confession is reconciliation and healing, not endless critique\n\n5. **The success/failure factors point**: The user is absolutely right. I should be evaluating:\n   Confession reveals profound transformation. Juan's breakthrough demonstrates genuine spiritual growth through:\n   - Concrete acknowledgment of past actions\n   - Emotional vulnerability\n   - Honest self-reflection\n   - Willingness to confront painful memories\n\n   Potential concerns remain about motivational authenticity, but the overall trajectory suggests meaningful personal reckoning.\n\n   Hernando's pastoral response requires nuanced compassion - recognizing vulnerability while providing spiritual guidance. The 71/100 score indicates a moment of significant healing, warranting supportive intervention rather than harsh judgment.\n\nYou're absolutely right, and I apologize. Let me reflect on what I did wrong:\n\nProblems with My Table\n\nIgnored Chapter 2.5 Context: Fray Hernando explicitly recognized he'd been \"relentless, harsh, unyielding\" and admitted he might be \"harsh taskmaster rather than wise guide.\" They agreed to a new dynamic. My table completely ignored this character development.\n\nMissed the Breakthrough: Juan just did exactly what Hernando asked for:\n\nMoved from abstract \"sins of pride\" to specific acts\n\nNamed real men (wounded in ambush, dying boy at Loja, hundreds as numbers)\n\nShowed genuine grief not intellectual analysis\n\nAdmitted the mechanism (comfort in pre-absolution)\n\nThis is a MAJOR success, not something requiring harsh correction.\n\nMisinterpreted the Ending: Juan's question \"must not have been for nothing, right Fray?\" after such vulnerable confession could be:\n\nGenuine spiritual anguish, not manipulation\n\nA cry for pastoral comfort after bearing his soul\n\nNatural human need for reassurance after confessing haunting deaths\n\nNot everything is a test or a trap.\n\nIgnored Success/Failure Factors: You're right - I should have evaluated:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nSpecific acts named (not abstractions)\n\nReal grief expressed\n\nVulnerability and honesty\n\nRecognition of the spiritual mechanism\n\nExactly what Hernando has been waiting for\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nPerhaps seeking reassurance at the end (minor compared to breakthrough)\n\nMisunderstood Confessional Practice: Historically, once sincere contrition is shown, the confessor's role is to provide absolution and comfort, not endless critique. After such a confession, continued harshness would be pastorally inappropriate and unhistorical.\n\nWhat Should Happen\n\nGiven the context (Hernando's self-awareness about harshness) and Juan's breakthrough confession, even low rolls should be pastorally appropriate - perhaps cautious or with gentle guidance, but not harsh confrontation.\n\nA roll of 71/100 should result in Hernando:\n\nRecognizing the breakthrough\n\nProviding pastoral comfort\n\nFinally granting the absolution Juan has been seeking\n\nOffering spiritual guidance going forward\n\nWould you like me to create a revised, historically appropriate response that reflects actual confessional practice and Hernando's character development?"

You have named what you carry.\" He makes the sign of the cross. \"Ego te absolvo - in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. For the sins you have confessed, for taking comfort in certainty rather than examining each moment in fear and trembling - you are forgiven.\" His voice gentles further. \"And that question at the end - 'must not have been for nothing?' - that is the human heart crying out under weight it was meant to carry differently. We will work on helping you bear it. But you are forgiven.\"\n71-100\nDeeply Moved Absolution - Hernando closes his eyes briefly. When he opens them, they glisten. His voice is thick: \"Your Majesty... I have been harsh with you. I have critiqued and examined and denied you absolution while you carried this weight.\" He stands, moves closer. \"You have just confessed real things. Not abstractions but men. Their faces. Their deaths. This is true confession.\" He makes the sign of the cross, his hand trembling slightly. \"Ego te absolvo in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. For taking comfort in pre-forgiveness. For not grieving properly because the banner made grief seem unnecessary. For the weight you've carried alone.\" His voice breaks slightly. \"You asked if their deaths must not have been for nothing. That question - that desperate need for their suffering to mean something - that is the cry of a soul that has been carrying unforgiven weight too long. You are forgiven, Your Majesty. And I will help you learn to carry this weight as a king must - honestly, without the false comfort of certainty, but also without the crushing burden of carrying it alone and unforgiven.\"\n\nReady for your roll."

Hernando recognizes the breakthrough, provides the sacramental absolution, and offers pastoral comfort while gently noting the continuing pattern (seeking reassurance).\n\nI need to:\n1. Narrate Hernando's response based on the 31-70 result\n2. Show this as a genuine pastoral moment, not gameplay challenge\n3. Provide the absolution Juan has been spiritually starving for\n4. Show Hernando's character development (less harsh, more compassionate)\n5. Perhaps naturally lead to what comes next - but STOP before generating Juan's response\n6. Remember: never generate Juan's dialogue or actions\n\nThis should be a significant, emotional moment - the resolution of a spiritual crisis that's been building since Rome.\n\nRoll: 53/100 - Warm Recognition and Absolution\n\nFray Hernando sat very still for a long moment. The afternoon light slanting through the window had shifted, casting longer shadows across the study floor. When he finally spoke, his voice carried something that hadn't been there in days - not harshness, not examination, but relief.\n\n\"This.\" He leaned forward, hands pressed together. \"This is what I have been waiting for.\"\n\nHis eyes searched Juan's face. \"Not philosophy about pride. Not elegant questions about whether you've been hiding. But grief. Real men. Real deaths. Real weight.\"\n\nHe stood slowly, moving closer to where Juan sat. \"Your Majesty, the wounded you left in the ambush whose names you never learned - that is not an abstraction. The boy at Loja who thought he'd won while dying - that is not a concept to be examined. The hundreds reduced to numbers in reports - those are souls, as you said. And you have carried them. Carried them without proper confession, without proper absolution, trying to bear the weight alone.\"\n\nFray Hernando made the sign of the cross, his hand steady and deliberate.\n\n\"Ego te absolvo in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. For the sins you have confessed - for taking comfort in certain forgiveness rather than examining each moment as it came. For allowing the righteousness of the crusade to become a shield against proper grief. For the spiritual disease of pre-absolution that made examining your conscience feel unnecessary. You are forgiven.\"\n\nHe placed his hand on Juan's shoulder - a gesture he hadn't made since their reunion. \"You have shown true contrition, Your Majesty. You have named what you carry. That is confession. And I...\" His voice caught slightly. \"I have been harsh with you these past days. Critiquing your presumption while you were spiritually starving. That was... that was not the guidance you needed.\"\n\nHernando returned to his chair, but his posture had changed - less the stern examiner, more the compassionate priest. \"That question you asked at the end - 'must not have been for nothing, right Fray?' - I hear it differently now. Not as manipulation or seeking validation, but as the cry of a soul that has carried unforgiven weight too long. The desperate need for their suffering to mean something.\"\n\nHe folded his hands in his lap. \"We will work on that together. On helping you carry this weight as a king must - honestly, without false comfort of certainty, but also without the crushing burden of carrying it alone and unforgiven. But for now...\"\n\nHis expression softened further. \"For now, Your Majesty, you are absolved. Truly absolved. Not the hollow formula you received in Rome, but genuine forgiveness after genuine confession. You have been carrying this since you knelt naked before the Holy Father, and you should not have had to carry it this long.\"\n\nThe room felt different now. Quieter. The weight that had hung in the air between them for days had shifted - not disappeared, but transformed into something more bearable.\n\nFray Hernando studied Juan's face with concern that was pastoral rather than critical. \"How do you feel, Your Majesty?\""

The roll is about HOW he accepts - the emotional tone and what commitments he makes about their future working relationship.\n\nEven low rolls should be acceptance, just perhaps more cautious or formal. High rolls should be warm, committed, with mutual acknowledgment of the difficulty ahead.\n\nLet me draft a table that reflects this is fundamentally about the tone and nature of ongoing spiritual direction, not whether it happens.\n\nD100 Table: Fray Hernando's Response to Juan's Request\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nProfound humility after absolution (shoulders shaking, \"I do not deserve it\")\n\nRecognition of grace, not personal merit\n\nHonest acknowledgment: \"I will stumble and fail\"\n\nCommitment to try despite knowing imperfection\n\nDeep trust shown in vulnerable request\n\nRespects Hernando's autonomy by offering honorable exit\n\nRecognition that being Juan's confessor is genuinely difficult work\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nVirtually none - this is a humble, honest request\n\nRoll Range\nResult\n1-25\nFormal Commitment - Hernando is quiet, then: \"Your Majesty, you ask if I will continue as your confessor now that I know the task. I already knew the task - I have known it since Rome. You are a king who seeks to reform Christendom while wrestling with presumption. That has always been the task.\" He makes a small gesture. \"Yes. I will continue. Not because the work is easy, but because it is my vocation. We will stumble together - you in your presumption, I in my harshness. But we will try.\" His tone is steady but not warm. Professional commitment rather than personal warmth.\n26-60\nCommitted Partnership - Hernando's expression softens. \"Your Majesty, you offer me an honorable way out, and I respect that. But I do not seek one.\" He leans forward. \"You will stumble. You will succumb to presumption. And yes, I will test your patience - I am harsh, suspicious, perhaps too quick to see pride where there is only human weakness.\" A slight smile. \"But that is what spiritual direction is. Two imperfect men trying to discern God's will. I will be your confessor, Your Majesty. Not because I have the patience of a saint, but because this is the work God has given me. And you... you are learning. Slowly. Painfully. But you are learning.\"\n61-85\nWarm Acceptance - Hernando's eyes glisten. \"Your Majesty, you ask if I will be your confessor now that I know the task?\" His voice roughens slightly. \"I do know the task. A twenty-year-old king carrying the weight of kingdoms, seeking to reform God's Church while wrestling with his own pride. A man who will stumble, will fail, will need correction again and again.\" He reaches out, grips Juan's shoulder. \"Yes. I will be your confessor. Not despite the difficulty, but because of it. This is my calling - to walk beside you through the stumbling. To correct when you need correction, to comfort when you need comfort, to help you distinguish God's voice from your own ambition. We will fail together sometimes. But we will try together.\"\n86-100\nDeeply Moved Covenant - Hernando cannot speak for a moment. His own eyes shine with tears. When he finds his voice, it trembles: \"Your Majesty... Juan... you ask if I will be your confessor? After what we have just shared?\" He stands, moves close, and kneels beside Juan's chair. \"I have watched you carry unforgiven weight for months. I have been harsh when you needed compassion. I have examined when you needed absolution. And now you ask me - offer me escape - while your shoulders shake with grace finally received?\" His voice breaks. \"Yes. A thousand times yes. This is my calling. To walk this path with you. To catch you when you stumble into presumption. To lift you when the weight crushes. To help you tell the difference between God's voice and your own certainty.\" He grips both of Juan's hands. \"We will fail together. You will test my patience. I will be too harsh. But we will stumble toward God together, and that is what spiritual direction is. I am your confessor, Your Majesty. Until God releases me from this calling, I am yours.\"\n\nReady for your roll."

It's a committed partnership - acknowledging both their flaws, but committing to the work together.\n\nKey elements from the 26-60 result:\n- Hernando doesn't seek an exit\n- Acknowledges both will stumble (Juan in presumption, he in harshness)\n- \"Two imperfect men trying to discern God's will\"\n- Professional but warm commitment\n- Recognition that Juan is learning, slowly and painfully\n- This is the work God has given him\n\nI need to write this naturally, avoiding generating Juan's dialogue or actions. Stop when appropriate for player response.\n\nRoll: 59/100 - Committed Partnership\n\nFray Hernando looked at Juan for a long moment - at the shaking shoulders, the raw vulnerability of a king who had just received grace he didn't think he deserved. Something in the confessor's face shifted, the harsh lines softening.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he said quietly, \"you offer me an honorable way out, and I respect that deeply. But I do not seek one.\"\n\nHe leaned forward, his weathered hands resting on his knees. \"You will stumble. You will succumb to presumption - probably tomorrow, possibly within the hour.\" A slight, almost wry expression crossed his face. \"And yes, you will test my patience. I am harsh, Your Majesty. I am suspicious. I am perhaps too quick to see pride where there is only human weakness trying to do its best in impossible circumstances.\"\n\nHernando's voice warmed slightly. \"But that is what spiritual direction is. Not a perfect confessor guiding a perfect penitent toward certain holiness. It is two imperfect men trying to discern God's will while wrestling with their own failures. You with your presumption. I with my harshness. Both of us stumbling.\"\n\nHe sat back, studying Juan's tear-stained face with something approaching fondness. \"I will be your confessor, Your Majesty. Not because I have the patience of a saint - God knows I do not. Not because this work is easy - it is perhaps the most difficult calling I have ever received. But because this is the work God has given me.\"\n\nA pause. \"And you... you are learning. Slowly. Painfully. With many steps backward for each step forward. But you are learning. That confession you just made? The grief you just showed? Six months ago in Rome, you could not have done that. You would have given me philosophy and elegant self-analysis. Today you gave me men's names. Men's faces. Real weight.\"\n\nFray Hernando's expression grew more serious. \"So yes. I will walk this path with you. I will correct you when correction is needed - and I will probably do it too harshly sometimes. I will deny you absolution when you are not ready - and I may sometimes deny it when I should grant it. I will test your patience as you test mine.\"\n\nHe spread his hands slightly. \"But we will stumble toward God together. And that, Your Majesty, is all any confessor and penitent can do. We are both imperfect instruments trying to discern the voice of a perfect God. We will fail. We will frustrate each other. But we will try.\"\n\nThe afternoon light had deepened now, casting amber across the study walls. Somewhere in the city below, bells rang for Vespers.\n\n\"This is my calling,\" Hernando said simply. \"Until God releases me from it, I am your confessor.\""

This is Basel, May 31, 1433, afternoon moving toward evening (Vespers bells just rang).\n\nThis is a dramatic shift - from intimate confession to public action. I should show the contrast and the reactions of those assembled. They haven't seen Juan since he went into confession with Fray Hernando. Now he emerges in full crusade regalia.\n\nI should describe the scene, the people assembled, their reactions, and then STOP before Juan speaks or acts further.\n\nFray Hernando followed Juan out of the study, his expression shifting from pastoral warmth to something more cautious - watching.\n\nJuan's voice rang through the merchant's house: \"Assemble everyone outside!\"\n\nServants scrambled. Footsteps echoed on wooden stairs. Within minutes, the courtyard of the merchant's house began to fill.\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso de Robles emerged first from the guardroom, hand instinctively on sword hilt at the command's urgency. Behind him came the fifty crusaders who had accompanied Juan from Rome - men in white surcoats marked with red crosses, their armor catching the late afternoon sun.\n\nAbbott Rodrigo González hurried from the house's upper chambers, his seventy-three years showing in his careful descent of the stairs. Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena appeared moments later, still holding a quill - he'd been drafting correspondence.\n\nSeveral younger clerics and delegates of the Castilian mission gathered near the edges of the courtyard. Household servants pressed against the walls, uncertain whether they should be present but unwilling to miss whatever was about to happen.\n\nThe courtyard fell silent as Juan emerged in full crusade armor - the white surcoat brilliant in the golden light, the red cross stark across his chest. The same armor he'd worn through the Reconquista. The same he'd worn when accepting Granada's surrender.\n\nCaptain Robles straightened immediately, years of military discipline snapping him to attention. The crusaders followed suit, forming rough ranks without needing orders. They knew this armor. They knew what it meant.\n\nAbbott Rodrigo's aged eyes widened slightly. Bishop Cartagena set down his quill, confusion and concern warring on his face - they had just seen their king enter private confession hours ago, looking exhausted and disillusioned. Now he stood before them transformed.\n\nFray Hernando stood to the side, apart from the assembled group. His face was unreadable - not disapproving, but watchful. Waiting to see what Juan would do with the grace he'd just received.\n\nThe courtyard held perhaps sixty souls now, all eyes on their king.\n\nThe silence stretched."

Still putting himself at center.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- These are HIS crusaders - they're already loyal\n- Abbott Rodrigo and Bishop Cartagena are more skeptical/cautious\n- Fray Hernando's watchful stance will be noticed\n- This follows genuine spiritual breakthrough, but is it too soon to be making grand declarations?\n\n**What would realistic responses be?**\n\nThe crusaders will likely respond positively - they're his men, they recognize the armor, the themes resonate. \n\nThe clergy and delegates present a more nuanced challenge. Their skepticism stems from Juan's recent emotional volatility. His sudden transformation from a defeated, disillusioned figure to a spiritually reinvigorated leader raises eyebrows. Some might perceive genuine change, while others see a familiar pattern of dramatic self-reinvention. The audience's response will depend on their perception of his sincerity and the depth of his spiritual breakthrough.\n\nThe potential reactions range from cautious intrigue to outright suspicion, with the possibility of a transformative moment that could sway even the most hardened skeptics.\n\nD100 Table: Response to Juan's Speech\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nGenuine spiritual transformation just occurred (visible in demeanor)\n\nCrusade armor carries symbolic weight and shared history\n\nThemes of spiritual warfare resonate with crusaders\n\nExplicit stepping back from Church reform shows humility\n\nEmphasis on confession and personal holiness is orthodox\n\n\"Non nobis Domine\" is their shared motto\n\nConcrete Constantinople commitment tomorrow\n\nInviting participation rather than commanding\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nDramatic shift from exhausted state hours ago\n\nCould seem theatrical (armor, sword raised high, grand speech)\n\nFray Hernando watching cautiously - others will notice\n\nAbbott and Bishop saw him disillusioned earlier, now transformed\n\nPattern concern: another grand gesture after spiritual moment?\n\nStill making declarations/leading even while saying he's stepping back\n\nSome may question: is this the pattern repeating already?\n\nRoll Range\nResult\n1-25\nCrusaders enthusiastic, clergy deeply concerned - Crusaders respond with \"Non nobis Domine!\" but Abbott Rodrigo exchanges worried glance with Bishop. Fray Hernando's watchful stance noticed by delegates. Enthusiasm genuine but clergy see pattern: spiritual breakthrough immediately becomes grand gesture.\n26-50\nMixed reception - Crusaders moved, raising swords. Clergy applaud politely but reserved. Abbott approaches after: \"Your Majesty, beautiful words. But perhaps... rest? Let transformation settle before declarations?\" Fray Hernando says nothing but expression shows concern.\n51-75\nGenuine but cautious response - Crusaders respond powerfully. Clergy moved but thoughtful. Abbott smiles sadly: \"Your Majesty speaks from the heart. But the heart is still learning.\" Bishop nods respectfully. Fray Hernando's expression softens slightly - sees genuine transformation but also sees Juan still being Juan.\n76-100\nDeeply moved recognition - Even skeptics see difference. Crusaders thunder \"Non nobis Domine!\" Abbott weeps quietly. Bishop crosses himself. Something in Juan's bearing shows the weight he carries differently now.

Juan's rapid transformation from despair to dramatic action mirrors the very behavioral pattern he was cautioned against. His immediate grand gestures, while potentially sincere, suggest an impulsive response rather than thoughtful reflection. The timing and intensity raise serious concerns about his ability to internalize the deeper lessons of his spiritual experience.\n\nThe potential ranges of response should carefully calibrate skepticism and potential acceptance. Low probability outcomes will likely express doubt, mid-range results might show cautious openness, and high rolls could indicate a tentative acceptance despite lingering reservations. This nuanced approach acknowledges the complexity of Juan's sudden transformation and the community's justified wariness.\n\nYou're absolutely right. I apologize - I didn't follow the methodology properly.\n\nLet me do this correctly:\n\nApproach Quality Assessment\n\nWhat Juan is doing:\n\nJust received profound absolution moments ago\n\nImmediately assembles everyone and dons crusade armor\n\nMakes grand speech with raised sword\n\nDeclares tomorrow's Constantinople commitment\n\nPattern concern: spiritual breakthrough → immediate grand gesture\n\nThis is a POOR approach because:\n\nTiming is terrible - Fray Hernando JUST absolved him after warning about presumption\n\nIt's the exact pattern - spiritual insight immediately becomes grand action\n\nOptics are concerning - exhausted/disillusioned hours ago, now transformed and making declarations\n\nFray Hernando is watching - and he warned Juan about this specific pattern\n\nThe clergy saw the earlier state - whiplash from one extreme to another\n\nHowever, it's not TERRIBLE because:\n\nThe spiritual transformation is genuine\n\nContent focuses on personal holiness not Church reform\n\nInvites rather than commands\n\nRevised D100 Table with Appropriate Ranges\n\nAssessment: POOR APPROACH - Success requires high rolls (60+)\n\nRoll Range\nResult\n1-40\nCrusaders enthusiastic, clergy deeply concerned - Crusaders respond \"Non nobis Domine!\" but Abbott exchanges worried glance with Bishop. Fray Hernando's watchful stance noticed. After: \"Your Majesty... this is the pattern. Spiritual breakthrough, then immediate grand gesture. Perhaps rest instead?\"\n41-60\nMixed reception, pattern recognized - Crusaders moved but clergy reserved. Abbott approaches gently: \"Beautiful words, Your Majesty. But maybe let the grace settle before declarations?\" Fray Hernando says nothing but expression shows concern about the familiar cycle.\n61-85\nGenuine but cautious response - Crusaders respond powerfully. Clergy see both sincerity and pattern. Abbott: \"Your Majesty speaks from the heart. The heart is learning, even if slowly.\" Fray Hernando's expression shows he sees both the real transformation and Juan still being Juan.\n86-100\nThey see through pattern to truth - Despite concerning timing, something in Juan's bearing shows he carries weight differently now.

          "text": "Roll: 37/100 - This falls in the 1-40 range: \"Crusaders enthusiastic, clergy deeply concerned\"\n\nThis is a poor result for a poor approach. The crusaders respond well because they're soldiers and this is their language - armor, swords, spiritual warfare, \"Non nobis Domine.\" But the clergy, especially those who saw Juan exhausted and disillusioned hours ago, are deeply concerned about the pattern.\n\nKey points to narrate:\n1. Crusaders respond enthusiastically - they love this\n2. But Abbott Rodrigo and Bishop Cartagena exchange worried glances\n3. Fray Hernando's watchful stance is noticed by the clergy\n4. After the moment, someone (probably Abbott) approaches with gentle concern\n5. The pattern is recognized: spiritual breakthrough → immediate grand gesture\n6. Suggestion to rest, let grace settle\n\nThis should feel like a moment where Juan's genuine transformation is real, but he's immediately falling back into the pattern Hernando warned about. The grace is genuine, but Juan is already channeling it into action/declaration rather than letting it settle.\n\nRoll: 37/100 - Crusaders enthusiastic, clergy deeply concerned\n\n\"Non nobis Domine!\"\n\nThe response thundered from the crusaders' throats. Fifty swords flashed from scabbards, raised high to catch the late afternoon sun. The white surcoats seemed to glow in the golden light. Captain Robles's voice led them, and the courtyard rang with their unified cry.\n\n\"NON NOBIS DOMINE!\"\n\nThe crusaders crashed swords against shields in rhythm. They had heard this language before - spiritual warfare, the fight against sin, the constant battle. This was their king in the armor they knew, speaking words that made sense to soldiers who had bled for the cross.\n\nBut beyond the ranks of enthusiastic warriors, Abbott Rodrigo González stood very still. His aged eyes met Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena's across the courtyard. The Bishop's hand, which had begun to rise in blessing, paused. A look passed between them - concern, recognition, something almost like grief.\n\nBoth had seen Juan just hours ago. Exhausted. Disillusioned. Speaking of being overwhelmed by Basel's chaos, of not caring anymore about confession. And now...\n\nNow their king stood in full crusade armor with a raised sword, making declarations before assembled crowds.\n\nFray Hernando had not moved. He stood to the side, his weathered face carefully neutral. But his posture - arms crossed, weight slightly back - spoke volumes to anyone who knew how to read a confessor's body language. He was not joining the enthusiasm. He was watching.\n\nAnd the clergy noticed.\n\nThe crusaders' cheers continued, genuine and powerful. But around the edges of the courtyard, the clerics and delegates shifted uncomfortably. Their eyes kept moving between their transformed king and their watchful confessor.\n\nAs the cheering began to fade, Abbott Rodrigo moved slowly through the crowd. His steps were measured, careful. He approached Juan with deep respect in his bearing, but also something else - a grandfather's gentle concern for a beloved but impulsive grandson.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he said quietly, pitched for Juan's ears and perhaps Fray Hernando's. His voice carried warmth but also weight. \"Those were beautiful words. Truly beautiful. The crusaders are moved, and rightly so.\"\n\nHe paused, choosing his next words with evident care. \"But Your Majesty... just hours ago, you were exhausted. Overwhelmed. And now...\" He gestured gently at the armor, the raised sword, the assembled crowd. \"This is... this is the pattern, is it not? A spiritual breakthrough, and then immediately - immediately - a grand gesture. A declaration. An assembly.\"\n\nThe old Abbott's eyes were kind but firm. \"Perhaps... perhaps what you need now is rest? To let the grace you received settle into your bones before channeling it into action? The transformation is real, Your Majesty. I can see it in your eyes. But transformation needs time to take root.\"\n\nBishop Cartagena had approached as well, standing respectfully behind the Abbott. He said nothing, but his expression echoed the concern.\n\nFray Hernando remained where he stood, still watching. His face showed neither approval nor disapproval - just that careful, pastoral observation of a confessor who had seen this cycle before.\n\nThe crusaders were still energized, talking among themselves, checking equipment, clearly eager for whatever came next. But the clergy stood in a careful, concerned circle around their king.\n\nThe courtyard felt suddenly divided - warriors ready for action, clergy urging pause."

The clergy struggle to name a concrete sin but Fray Hernando articulates the deeper issue: not the act itself but Juan's inability to simply receive grace and rest in it, always channeling spiritual experience into immediate action. Juan deflects by calling himself 'no theologian,' declares he is going for a walk through the city, and invites everyone to dinner to discuss further. Fray Hernando, tired and sad rather than angry, tells Juan plainly that he is demonstrating the exact pattern they just warned about: receiving pushback, engaging just enough to deflect, then moving on.",

He might struggle to articulate the specific sin because... is there one? Or is this just concern about the pattern?\n\n**Fray Hernando**: He JUST absolved Juan. He warned about this pattern in earlier sessions. But Juan is right - what is the actual sin in sharing joy about absolution with his men? Being a king who acts decisively? \n\nThis is actually a really good test: Can the clergy articulate a specific sin, or are they just being overly cautious? Juan might actually be right here.\n\nI should NOT generate Juan's dialogue or actions. I should have the NPCs respond to his challenge. This requires thought - they need to either:\n1. Identify a specific sin (if there is one)\n2. Admit they're being overly cautious\n3. Try to articulate their concern more precisely\n\nLet me think about what the actual concern might be:\n- The TIMING (moments after absolution, immediately into action)\n- The OPTICS (exhausted to energized seems like whiplash)\n- The CONCERN that Juan hasn't let the grace settle\n- The FEAR that he's using spiritual experience as fuel for immediate action\n\nBut are any of these sins? Or are they just... concerns about prudence?\n\nI think the NPCs need to grapple with Juan's challenge honestly. He's made a fair point.\n\nAbbott Rodrigo opened his mouth, then closed it. His aged brow furrowed. He looked to Bishop Cartagena, who also hesitated.\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" the Abbott began, then paused. \"The sin is...\" He stopped again, struggling. \"It is not... I cannot say there is a specific sin in what you just did.\"\n\nBishop Cartagena stepped forward. \"Your Majesty, you are right. Sharing joy with your men after receiving grace - that is not sin. Leading them - that is your office. Being decisive - that is kingship.\" He spread his hands. \"Perhaps we are being overly cautious.\"\n\nBut Fray Hernando finally moved. He walked forward slowly, his face thoughtful rather than harsh. When he spoke, his voice was careful.\n\n\"Your Majesty, you ask where the sin is. That is... that is a fair question.\" He paused, clearly thinking through his answer. \"There may be no sin in the act itself. Sharing grace with your men. Leading them. These are good things.\"\n\nHe gestured to the armor, the assembled crowd. \"But the timing. You received absolution perhaps... what, half an hour ago? Less? And already you are in armor, making declarations, committing to Constantinople tomorrow.\"\n\nFray Hernando's expression showed he was genuinely grappling with Juan's challenge. \"Is the sin in acting? No. But perhaps... perhaps the question is whether the grace has time to transform you before you use it as fuel for action. You said yourself moments ago: 'I will stumble and fail. I will succumb to presumption.' And I said I would help you carry that weight.\"\n\nHe met Juan's eyes. \"But Your Majesty, we have not even left the room where you received absolution, and already you are... doing. Not resting in what you received. Not letting it settle. But immediately channeling it into grand gesture.\"\n\nThe confessor's voice gentled. \"You ask where the sin is. Perhaps there is none. Perhaps we are being overly cautious, as the Bishop says. Or perhaps...\" He paused. \"Perhaps the sin is not in the doing, but in the inability to not do. To simply receive grace and rest in it, even for an evening.\"\n\nAbbott Rodrigo nodded slowly. \"Your Majesty is right that you are a king, not a monk. Things are expected. But...\" The old man chose his words carefully. \"Even kings need time for grace to take root before bearing fruit. That is not monastic withdrawal. That is... wisdom.\"\n\nThe courtyard had grown quiet. The crusaders watched their king and the clergy with uncertain expressions.\n\nFray Hernando added quietly: \"You ask us to identify the sin so you can examine it. That is good. Honest. But Your Majesty... do you see that you are doing it again? Turning even this conversation into action? 'Tell me the sin so I can examine it' - already looking forward to the next task, the next thing to accomplish. Rather than simply... being still with what you just received.\""

What happened here was just that I felt inspired and relieved. I acted in the grand gestures and speeches that are normal to me. It felt...right somehow. I wanted to share a moment with the men who have recieved absolution with me from the pope and share my own breakthrough with them. Maybe some struggle the same way I did with the papal absolution. I also wanted to not keep what I had discussed with Fray in private to just myself. Sharing it out in the open somehow feels more... sincere?\n\n\nLook at me, discussing theology like a priest.

          "text": "Juan is:\n1. Defending his actions - saying there was no sin, so what's the problem?\n2. Explaining his motivations - wanted to share, felt right, wanted to be open\n3. Dismissing continued discussion - \"Look at me, discussing theology like a priest\"\n4. Leaving for a walk - not engaging further\n5. Deferring to dinner - \"we can discuss further\" but effectively ending the conversation now\n\nThis is a deflection. The clergy raised genuine concerns about the pattern, Juan asked them to identify the sin, they struggled but raised good points about timing and inability to rest in grace, and Juan's response is essentially:\n- \"You agree there's no sin, so I'm vindicated\"\n- \"It felt right to me\"\n- \"I'm not a theologian anyway\"\n- \"Let's talk later\"\n\nAnd then leaving.\n\nThis is NOT a good approach. It's:\n- Dismissive of their concerns\n- Missing the point about the pattern\n- Using their nuanced response (\"maybe no specific sin but...\") as vindication\n- Ending the conversation on his terms\n- The \"discussing theology like a priest\" line is bordering on condescending\n\nHowever, Juan is the king and they are his subjects/advisors. He has the authority to end the conversation.

By cutting off meaningful dialogue and using his royal status to silence legitimate spiritual guidance, he's reinforcing the problematic behavioral pattern that the clergy cautioned him about.

We will gladly continue at dinner.\" Fray Hernando's expression is unreadable but not disapproving - perhaps accepting that transformation takes time and Juan needs space to process. They give him the room he's claiming.\n86-100\nUnderstanding Grace - Abbott smiles gently. \"Yes, Your Majesty. Sometimes we need to move, to act, to share. Not everything must be examined to death.\" Fray Hernando nods once: \"Go on your walk.

When he opened them, his expression carried something that looked like grief mixed with exhaustion.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His voice was quiet, not harsh, but weighted with tired recognition. \"You are doing it right now. Right now, in front of us.\"\n\nHe gestured gently at the space between them. \"We raised a concern. You asked us to identify the sin.

Then you dismissed our actual concern by joking about 'discussing theology like a priest.' And now you are leaving.\"\n\nThe confessor's shoulders sagged slightly. \"This is the pattern, Your Majesty. Challenge arrives. You engage it just enough to deflect it. Then you move on to the next thing. The walk through the city. The dinner discussion. Always moving. Always doing. Never... never simply receiving what has been given and sitting with it.\"\n\nAbbott Rodrigo's aged face showed something like sorrow. He nodded slowly but said nothing. What could he say? Juan was the king. If the king wished to leave, he would leave.\n\nBishop Cartagena bowed respectfully, but his eyes reflected the same resignation. They had tried. They had raised the concern as gently as they could. And they had watched their king demonstrate the exact pattern they'd been concerned about.\n\nFray Hernando sighed - not dramatically, but with the simple exhaustion of a man who had just given profound absolution only to watch the recipient immediately revert to familiar cycles.\n\n\"Go on your walk, Your Majesty,\" he said quietly. \"We will speak at dinner.\"\n\nThere was no anger in his voice. No judgment. Just... tiredness. And perhaps a touch of sadness - not at Juan's failure, but at the recognition of how hard this transformation would actually be.\n\nThe crusaders still stood at attention, uncertain. The courtyard had grown uncomfortable - no longer filled with inspiring rhetoric but with the awkward silence that follows when authority figures disagree in public.\n\nAbbott Rodrigo placed a gentle hand on Fray Hernando's shoulder. The old man looked at Juan with grandfather's eyes - loving, but seeing clearly what was happening.\n\n\"We will be here when you return, Your Majesty,\" the Abbott said simply. \"Enjoy your walk.\"\n\nThe words were kind. But underneath them lay an unspoken understanding: they could not stop this pattern. They could only walk beside it, point it out when they saw it, and pray that eventually - perhaps over years rather than hours - transformation would take deeper root.\n\nCaptain Robles stepped forward. \"Your Majesty, shall I accompany you?\""
