Character locations and status (from CHARACTER_DATABASE.md)\n3. World state and all major divergences (from WORLD_STATE_OVERVIEW.md)\n4. Where Chapter 42 ended (from Chapter 42 summary)\n\nThe chapter ended on December 2, 1432, in Toledo. Juan has:\n- Ordered 5 war galleys and 4 armed carracks for naval power\n- Approved the converted Muslim delegation to Morocco\n- Decided on Gibraltar Strait cooperation with Portugal\n- Planned Mediterranean commerce expansion\n- Financial position: ~446,500 florins total (after fleet orders)\n\nUpcoming immediate events:\n- Ducal tax responses arriving (Roll 23 = grudging compliance with conditions)\n- Meeting with Council of Great Houses\n- Continued strategic planning\n\nNow I need to provide a SHORT 2-4 paragraph setup of the current situation and STOP to wait for player action. Let me think about what's happening now...\n\nFrom the end of Chapter 42, it seems like the immediate next thing would be either:\n1. The ducal tax responses arriving (mentioned as \"expected any day\")\n2. The meeting with Council of Great Houses\n3. Some other development\n\nLooking at the notes, Álvaro was going to inform Juan when the ducal messages arrive, and he was going to send word to Don Íñigo about the Council meeting.\n\nI think a natural starting point would be morning of December 3, 1432, and perhaps one of these matters is now ready for Juan's attention.\n\nLet me craft a SHORT scene that sets up the situation and STOPS to let the player act. Remember: 2-4 paragraphs, establish what's happening, then STOP.\n\nPerfect. I have reviewed all the necessary files and understand the campaign status. Let me begin Chapter 43.\n\nDecember 3, 1432 - Toledo, Royal Alcázar\n\nThe morning sun slants through the tall windows of your private study, warming the stone walls against the December chill. Isabel and Catalina still sleep in the adjacent chambers—your daughter's soft breathing audible through the partially open door. The reunion with your family continues to feel like a gift after nine months of campaign, and yesterday's long session with Álvaro about naval strategy and North African plans has left your mind full of possibilities and logistics.\n\nA knock at the door interrupts your morning prayers. One of the household servants enters and bows. \"Your Majesty, Don Álvaro de Luna requests audience. He says messages have arrived from the Duke of Arévalo and the Duke of Medina Sidonia—responses to the Crown Marshal ultimatums.\"\n\nThe tax matter. Six weeks ago, your Crown Marshals delivered ultimatums to both dukes: pay all back taxes, appear before you to explain the delays, or be declared in rebellion. The moment of truth has arrived. Álvaro waits in the antechamber with the sealed letters.\n\nWhat do you do?"

He's asking if she'd like to accompany him on future sea voyages.\n\nI need to:\n1. Show Isabel's reaction to this proposal\n2. Consider her character: she's grown more confident, had spiritual breakthrough about faith despite fear, loves Juan deeply, but also has practical concerns\n3. She's likely pregnant again (conceived December 1432 or January 1433 based on timeline)\n4. She nearly died in childbirth with Catalina\n5. She has a 10-month-old daughter to care for\n6. She spent 9 months terrified while Juan campaigned\n7. But she also had a breakthrough about trusting God despite fear\n\nThis is a complex emotional moment. She would probably:\n- Be touched by the invitation (shows he wants her with him)\n- Be nervous about sea travel (dangerous)\n- Have maternal concerns (Catalina, possibly pregnant)\n- Remember her spiritual breakthrough (faith despite fear, not absence of fear)\n- Want to be with Juan but also worried about practicalities\n\nI should write 2-4 paragraphs showing her reaction, then STOP for Juan's response.\n\nYou find Isabel in the adjacent chamber, seated by the window with morning light catching the gold threads in her Portuguese dress. She's watching Catalina play with a wooden toy on a blanket nearby, and Dona Beatriz sits at her embroidery in the corner. Your wife looks up as you enter, and her face brightens—that smile that still makes your heart catch after two years of marriage.\n\n\"A flagship?\" She rises and comes to you, taking your hands. \"You ordered a ship built?\" There's wonder in her voice, then a flicker of something more complex crosses her face. \"Constantinople... Venice...\" She glances at Catalina, then back to you. \"That's—that's months at sea, isn't it? Maybe longer?\"\n\nShe's quiet for a moment, and you can see her working through it. The woman who spent nine months terrified while you campaigned in Granada. But also the woman who just had a spiritual breakthrough about faith despite fear. \"I would love to see those places with you,\" she says softly. \"I would. But...\" She touches her stomach briefly—an unconscious gesture that might mean nothing, or might mean everything. \"There are practical matters. Catalina is so young. And the sea is... dangerous.\"\n\nA pause. Then she meets your eyes directly. \"But you're asking if I want to accompany you. Not if it's wise, or safe, or practical. Yes, Juan. If God wills it and circumstances allow—yes, I would sail with you to see the world.\""

Keep it SHORT (2-4 paragraphs) since this is active dialogue.\n\nIsabel's expression softens with understanding, though you can see the shadow that passes across her face at the mention of months apart again. She squeezes your hands.\n\n\"I knew when I married a crusader king that I wasn't marrying a man who would sit in Toledo embroidering tapestries.\" There's a slight smile, but her eyes are serious. \"And I'm learning—still learning—to trust God with my fears instead of being ruled by them.\" She glances at Catalina. \"But yes, Juan. Another year of separation... it's hard. Especially if—\" She pauses, not quite saying it. \"If I am expecting again, I'll want you here. Need you here.\"\n\nShe looks up at you. \"Granada, Rome, Basel—these are necessary. Important. I understand that. But afterward? When the relics are returned and the Council meetings done?\" Her voice is gentle but firm. \"Could we find a way? Even if you must campaign again someday, could there be more time for us?

The door to the outer chamber closes softly. What follows is tender and unhurried, the gift of intimacy that you've reclaimed together after the trauma of Catalina's birth. When you finally rise and dress, Isabel remains in the bed, watching you with that particular contentment that needs no words.\n\n\"I love you,\" she says simply.\n\n\"And I love you,\" you reply, bending to kiss her forehead. \"I'll return before the midday meal.\"\n\nYou find Álvaro in your private study, two sealed letters on the table before him.

Nevertheless, I acknowledge the crown's rightful claim and will arrange immediate payment of 25,000 maravedís, with the remaining 13,000 to follow within four months as harvests are collected. I request the privilege of private audience to discuss proper assessment methods going forward, that we might serve Your Majesty's revenue needs more accurately.\"\n\nYou look up at Álvaro.

He's also subtly asserting that this is now a matter for the bureaucracy (Crown Marshals) rather than personal negotiation with the king.\n\nÁlvaro would recognize this as a strong move that maintains the precedent: the Crown Marshals have authority, taxes must be paid, and compliance doesn't automatically grant special access to the king.\n\nThen Juan asks if all matters are addressed. Let me check what's pending:\n- The ducal responses (just handled)\n- Council of Great Houses meeting (requested but not yet scheduled)\n- Trade delegation to Italy (Diego organizing)\n- Crusader matters (already clarified - they'll be released after Rome)\n- Te Deum invitations (already sent)\n- Fleet construction (orders placed)\n- Converted Muslim delegation (will form after Te Deum)\n\nSo there are still a few items, but the immediate pressing matters are addressed.

Public court rather than private audience, and Crown Marshals handling the details.\" He nods approvingly. \"That maintains the precedent.

The trade delegation to Italy needs final composition and instructions from Diego, though that's his task, not requiring your immediate decision. And at some point before you depart for Granada in April, you'll want to brief Commander Martín and Fernando about the North African mission.\"\n\nÁlvaro meets your eyes. \"But nothing urgent today or tomorrow.

          "text": "1. Isabel's pregnancy confirmation and excellent health\n2. Precious time with Catalina including developmental milestones\n3. Mendoza Council's remarkable success\n4. Trade delegation achievements\n5. Military Academy excellence\n6. Positive international developments\n7. Shipyard progress\n8. Family happiness\n\nThis should be written as a narrative summary covering December through mid-March, hitting the key beats while showing Juan's life as king, husband, and father during peacetime. I'll keep it comprehensive but flowing, showing the progression of time.\n\nWINTER IN TOLEDO: December 1432 - Mid-March 1433\n\nThe months that follow become a gift—the kind of peaceful, productive time that kings rarely experience.\n\nIsabel and the Second Pregnancy\n\nBy late December, Isabel's suspicions are confirmed. The royal physician examines her and pronounces what both of you already knew in your hearts: she is expecting again, likely due in late August or early September. But unlike the first pregnancy, this one begins gently. No severe sickness, no debilitating fatigue. Isabel blooms.\n\n\"I think,\" she tells you one January evening as snow falls outside the windows, \"that God is being merciful this time. Or perhaps it's just that I'm not so afraid.\" She rests her hand on her still-flat stomach. \"I know what to expect now. I know you'll be here. That makes all the difference.\"\n\nThe physicians are cautiously optimistic. They monitor her closely given the trauma of Catalina's birth, but the pregnancy progresses normally through the winter months. Isabel maintains her strength, walks daily through the palace gardens when weather permits, and glows with that particular radiance that comes from joy rather than just biology.\n\nBy March, when your departure for Granada approaches, she is five months along—visibly pregnant but healthy and strong. \"Go,\" she tells you firmly. \"Do what you must in Granada and Rome. But be back by August. That's all I ask.\"\n\nCatalina's Development\n\nYour daughter transforms during these months. At ten months when you returned from Granada, she was just beginning to crawl and babble. By mid-March, at fourteen months, she walks—unsteadily, arms outstretched for balance, but she walks. She toddles from you to Isabel, squealing with delight when you catch her.\n\nAnd then, one February morning at breakfast, it happens. Catalina is in your lap, reaching for a piece of bread. She looks up at you and says clearly: \"Papa.\"\n\nYou freeze. Isabel gasps from across the table. Catalina, oblivious to the magnitude of the moment, simply smiles and says it again: \"Papa.\"\n\n\"Did you hear that?\" Isabel's eyes fill with tears. \"Her first word!\"\n\nThe next week brings \"Mama,\" and within days Catalina is attempting to name everything she sees—\"pan\" for bread, \"agua\" for water, simplified versions of the Portuguese and Castilian words she hears daily. You find yourself spending hours simply talking to her, watching her try to repeat sounds, delighting in her growing personality.\n\nShe has Isabel's eyes but your determination—when she wants something, she pursues it relentlessly, crawling or toddling after it with single-minded focus. She adores music, clapping her hands when musicians play in the hall. And she has developed the endearing habit of falling asleep on your chest in the evenings, her small hand clutching your thumb.\n\n\"She won't remember these months,\" Isabel says softly one night as you both watch Catalina sleep. \"But we will. When you're old and gray, you'll remember her first words, her first steps. That you were here for them.\"\n\nThe Mendoza Council's Triumph\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza presents the Council of Great Houses' progress in early January, and the results exceed even your optimistic expectations.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he reports with barely concealed pride, \"we have conducted comprehensive audits on the three initial member families—my own House Mendoza, House Enríquez, and House de la Cerda. The results are... illuminating.\"\n\nThe Council has identified an additional 15,000 maravedís in underpayments from just these three houses—not malicious tax evasion, but the accumulated result of outdated assessments, optimistic valuations, and convenient accounting errors. All three families have paid immediately and without protest.\n\n\"But that's not the remarkable part,\" Don Íñigo continues. \"The remarkable part is what happened next.\"\n\nWord of the Council's success has spread through the nobility like wildfire. By February, three more great houses—House Velasco, House Manrique, and House Álvarez de Toledo—have formally petitioned to join the Council. They want to be part of this voluntary accountability system, to be recognized as great families who police themselves rather than wait for Crown Marshals to arrive with ultimatums.\n\n\"They see it as a privilege now,\" Don Íñigo explains. \"A mark of distinction. Being part of the Council means you're one of the families that sets the standard, not one that merely follows it. And the peer pressure...\" He smiles. \"No great house wants to be the one that disappoints the others. The shame of being audited and found wanting by your peers is worse than any royal fine.\"\n\nBy March, the Council has grown to six member houses and is discussing formal procedures, regular meeting schedules, and standardized audit practices. Don Íñigo suggests that in another year, the Council could be handling most noble tax compliance without Crown Marshal involvement at all.\n\n\"This is what sustainable governance looks like,\" Álvaro observes after the meeting. \"Not the king forcing compliance through threat of force, but the nobility choosing to govern themselves because it serves their honor and interests. Don Íñigo has created something that could outlast all of us.\"\n\nTrade Delegation Success\n\nDiego de Daza spends January and February organizing the trade delegation to Italy with meticulous care. He selects six experienced merchants—two from Seville, two from Toledo, one from Burgos, one from Córdoba—along with two royal officials to represent crown interests and one translator fluent in Italian dialects.\n\nTheir instructions are clear: negotiate favorable terms for Málaga and other captured ports, establish relationships with major Italian trading houses, and secure agreements for regular commerce. They are authorized to offer competitive customs rates, guaranteed property rights, and access to African trade routes through Granada.\n\nThe delegation departs in late February for Genoa and Venice. By early March, first letters arrive reporting remarkable success. The Genoese, who already have relationships with Castile from the Granada campaign, are eager to formalize commercial arrangements. They see Málaga as a perfect complement to their existing Mediterranean network and are willing to commit to regular shipping routes.\n\nVenice is more cautious but intrigued. Their merchants want to see the port infrastructure before making commitments, but they acknowledge that a western Mediterranean route through Málaga could save them weeks of travel time for goods destined for Atlantic markets.\n\nMost surprisingly, both cities express interest in the African trade potential. The idea of a secure western route for gold, ivory, and spices—avoiding the Ottoman-dominated eastern Mediterranean—appeals to merchants who have watched Turkish power expand with alarm.\n\nDiego reports that the delegation has also made contact with Florentine banking houses interested in financing Castilian commercial ventures. \"They see a kingdom with growing naval power, secure ports, and royal backing,\" his letter notes. \"They want to invest before others recognize the opportunity.\"\n\nMilitary Academy Excellence\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont's Royal Military Academy produces its first results by March, and they are impressive.\n\nThe Academy has trained twenty-three junior officers over the winter—younger sons of noble families, promoted sergeants, a few foreign volunteers including two Germans and a Pole. The curriculum combines theoretical study (tactics, logistics, fortification design) with practical training (drill, command exercises, siege simulations).\n\nYou visit the Academy in February to observe training exercises. What you see is revelation. The officers aren't just memorizing maneuvers—they're thinking tactically, adapting to changing situations, coordinating multiple units with precision that would have been impossible a year ago.\n\nSir Thomas demonstrates with obvious pride. \"Watch this, Your Majesty.\" He sets up a scenario: defending a fortress against superior numbers. The young officers split into defending and attacking teams. Within minutes, they're deploying counter-battery positions, organizing sorties, calculating supply requirements, adjusting to simulated intelligence reports.\n\n\"This is what I learned fighting in France,\" Sir Thomas explains. \"The English win battles not because we're braver, but because our officers understand warfare as a system—supply, intelligence, terrain, morale, all of it. These men are learning that.\"\n\nBy March, five of the graduating officers receive immediate commissions in the royal forces. Two are assigned to garrison commands in Granada. One joins the artillery train under Master Gunner Pietro Calabrese. Two more are retained as Academy instructors for the next cohort.\n\n\"Give me three more years,\" Sir Thomas tells you, \"and we'll have fifty officers who understand modern warfare better than anyone in Christendom except perhaps the Ottomans. And in five years? We'll surpass even them.\"\n\nInternational Developments\n\nLetters from abroad bring consistently positive news throughout the winter.\n\nFrom Basel (Fray Hernando, January): The Castilian delegation continues to wield unexpected influence. Two more church reform proposals citing \"Castilian practice\" have been incorporated into Council decrees. The Hussite negotiations are progressing—slowly, but progressing. Three of the contentious Articles have been partially resolved through compromise language that both Bohemians and Rome can accept.\n\nMost remarkably, Fray Hernando reports that Cardinal Cesarini has begun consulting him not just on theological matters but on practical governance questions. \"He asks how Your Majesty maintains both papal loyalty and reform commitment,\" the letter notes. \"How you strengthen royal authority while respecting noble rights. Your example is teaching more than theology here—it's teaching statecraft.\"\n\nFrom Basel (Fray Hernando, February): Cardinal Cesarini writes a personal letter—addressed directly to you, not just transmitted through Fray Hernando. In it, he explicitly praises Castile's Basel influence:\n\n\"Your Majesty, your kingdom's delegation has become the conscience of this Council. When extremes clash, it is the Castilian voice that calls both sides back to reason. When theory departs from practice, it is Castilian experience that grounds us. I write not as papal legate but as a churchman grateful for your witness. The crusade you fought in Granada continues here in Basel, though the weapons are words rather than swords.\"\n\nFrom Portugal (King João I, February): Isabel's father sends a warm letter confirming his attendance at the Granada Te Deum. He is bringing his eldest son Prince Duarte and his younger son Prince Henrique (Henry the Navigator). The letter expresses genuine joy at the Reconquista's completion and mentions that \"matters of mutual interest regarding our southern neighbors\" should be discussed when you meet—a clear reference to Morocco and North African strategy.\n\n\"My daughter writes that you are to be a father again,\" King João adds. \"God grant you a son this time, though I confess my granddaughter Catalina holds my heart regardless. May this pregnancy bring joy rather than the fear of the first.\"\n\nFrom Hungary (János Hunyadi, March): A second letter arrives from the Transylvanian voivode. He has been consulting with King Władysław III of Poland about potential anti-Ottoman coordination. \"Poland is interested,\" Hunyadi writes, \"especially if Castile—a kingdom that actually completes what it starts—leads the alliance. They've heard too many promises from German princes who talk of crusading but never march. Your reputation changes calculations.\"\n\nShipyard Reports\n\nPerhaps most tangibly exciting are the regular reports from the Cantabrian shipyards where your fleet is under construction.\n\nIn January, the keels for all nine ships have been laid—five war galleys and four carracks. Master shipwright Gonzalo Fernández sends detailed progress sketches showing the frame construction. Everything is on schedule.\n\nBy February, the galleys' frames are taking shape. The carracks—larger and more complex—are progressing more slowly, but still within projected timelines. Gonzalo reports he has secured excellent Basque oak for the hulls and has hired additional master craftsmen to ensure quality.\n\nIn March comes unexpected good news: the flagship construction is ahead of schedule. Gonzalo believes it might be ready by July rather than August, which would allow it to sail you to Rome instead of requiring overland travel. \"It would be fitting,\" Gonzalo writes, \"for Your Majesty to arrive at the Vatican aboard a Castilian flagship flying the royal standard. Let them see that Spain is a naval power now.\"\n\nThe image appeals to you—sailing into Rome's port of Ostia with the True Cross and Santiago's bone aboard a Castilian warship, cannon mounted on the rails, royal banner streaming. A symbol of the kingdom you're building.\n\nFamily Christmas\n\nThe Christmas season becomes a particular joy. You celebrate Christ's birth with Isabel, Catalina, and the court in Toledo's great cathedral. Catalina is fascinated by the nativity scene, reaching out to touch the wooden figures of Mary, Joseph, and the infant Jesus.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, as snow falls gently outside, you hold a small private celebration in your chambers. Isabel is four months pregnant but energetic. Catalina toddles around excitedly, delighted by the festive decorations and the musicians playing carols.\n\n\"This,\" Isabel says softly as you sit together by the fire, Catalina drowsing in her lap, \"is what I dreamed marriage could be. Not just duty and alliance, but... this. Joy. Family. Love.\"\n\nYou pull her close. \"Two years ago, I was eighteen and terrified of everything except God's will. Now I'm twenty, and I've learned that God's will includes moments like this.\"\n\n\"Do you ever think,\" Isabel asks, \"about how unlikely all of this was? That the shy Portuguese princess and the crusader king would find this?\" She touches your face. \"I thank God for you every day, Juan. For your patience, your kindness, your...\" She smiles. \"Your faith, even when you're uncertain. Especially then.\"\n\nMarch Departure Approaching\n\nBy mid-March, with spring arriving and travel becoming feasible again, you begin preparations for departure to Granada. The bags are packed. The escort is assembled—your royal guard, the crusader banner contingent, various officials who will help prepare for the Te Deum ceremony.\n\nIsabel is five months pregnant and showing clearly now. The physicians are pleased with her progress. \"If all continues this well,\" the senior physician tells you privately, \"this birth should be far less traumatic than the first. The body remembers how, and she is healthier and less fearful this time.\"\n\nYour final days in Toledo are bittersweet. You spend every possible hour with Isabel and Catalina. Your daughter has started saying \"Papa go?\" whenever she sees bags being packed, and it breaks your heart a little each time.\n\n\"Two months in Granada preparing and hosting the Te Deum,\" you remind Isabel. \"Then two months traveling to Rome and Basel. I'll be back by late July, early August at the latest. Well before the baby comes.\"\n\n\"I trust you,\" Isabel says simply. \"And I trust God. Go build your kingdom, Juan. We'll be here when you return. And this time...\" She places your hand on her pregnant belly. \"This time, you'll come home to meet your second child, not leave right after the birth.\"\n\nOn the morning of your departure—March 18, 1433—you hold Catalina one more time. She's crying, not understanding why Papa is leaving. \"Papa back soon,\" you promise her in simplified words she can understand. \"Papa loves you.\"\n\nYou kiss Isabel goodbye, holding her longer than protocol requires. \"Stay healthy,\" you whisper. \"Both of you.\"\n\n\"We will,\" she promises. \"Go with God, my love.\"\n\nAs you ride south from Toledo toward Granada, you carry with you the memory of four months of peace, joy, and family that sustain you for the journey ahead. Isabel is healthy and pregnant. Catalina is thriving and speaking her first words. Your kingdom is prospering. The nobility is governing itself. Your institutions are working. Your international reputation is growing.\n\nFor the first time since taking the throne three years ago, you feel not just like a king doing his duty, but like a man building something that will endure.\n\nSTATUS AT DEPARTURE (March 18, 1433)\n\nPersonal:\n\nIsabel: 5 months pregnant, healthy, due late August/early September\n\nCatalina: 14 months old, walking and speaking first words\n\nMarriage: Deeply loving, strengthened by winter together\n\nKingdom:\n\nTreasury: ~446,500 florins\n\nCouncil of Great Houses: 6 member families, collecting taxes voluntarily\n\nTrade delegation: Successful preliminary agreements with Genoa and Venice\n\nMilitary Academy: First 23 officers trained, 5 commissioned\n\nFleet construction: On schedule, flagship possibly ready by July\n\nUpcoming:\n\nArrive Granada late March\n\nTe Deum ceremony April 1433\n\nDepart for Rome May 1433\n\nCouncil of Basel June-July 1433\n\nReturn to Toledo by August 1433 for Isabel's delivery\n\nWhat do you do as you travel to Granada?"

          "text": "Álvaro de Luna - Private Study, March 17\n\nThe evening before your departure, you meet privately with Álvaro in your study. Maps and documents cover the table—the accumulated work of governing Castile that will now fall entirely to him in your absence.\n\n\"Four months,\" Álvaro says, reviewing the timeline. \"Granada through April for the Te Deum. Rome in May. Basel in June and early July. Back by late July or early August.\" He meets your eyes. \"I'll keep the kingdom running, Your Majesty. Diego will continue the revenue reforms. The Crown Marshals will enforce compliance. The Council of Great Houses will meet monthly. The shipyards will build your fleet.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"And I'll watch over Isabel. Send regular reports on her health. If anything changes—anything at all—I'll send fast couriers to find you, even in Rome or Basel.\"\n\nThe man who has guided you since you took the throne, who held the kingdom together when the Infantes rebelled, who has never once overreached his authority—he looks older than his years in this moment, the weight of responsibility evident.\n\n\"You've built something remarkable these past three years,\" Álvaro says quietly. \"When you return in August, you'll find it still standing. That's my promise to you.\"\n\nThe Royal Military Academy - March 17\n\nThe afternoon before departure, you ride to the Military Academy on Toledo's outskirts. Sir Thomas has assembled the twenty-three graduating officers and the new cohort of thirty-two cadets—fifty-five young men who represent the future of Castilian military power.\n\nThey stand at attention as you dismount. You can see the mix of emotions—pride at the royal visit, nervousness at your scrutiny, determination to prove themselves worthy.\n\nSir Thomas calls them to attention. \"His Majesty King Juan II!\"\n\nWhat do you say to these officers who will one day command your armies?\n\nIsabel and Catalina - Royal Chambers, Evening of March 17\n\nAfter returning from the Academy, you find Isabel and Catalina in your private chambers. Dona Beatriz and the other Portuguese ladies have withdrawn to give you privacy. Catalina is playing on the floor with her wooden toys, and Isabel sits by the fire, one hand resting on her pregnant belly.\n\n\"Tomorrow morning,\" Isabel says softly. Not a question. She's known this moment was coming, but that doesn't make it easier.\n\nCatalina looks up and sees you. \"Papa!\" She toddles over with her arms outstretched, and you sweep her up. She's gotten heavier in these four months—no longer an infant but a little girl.\n\n\"Papa go?\" she asks, her vocabulary still limited but her meaning clear. She's noticed the packed bags, the preparations, the tension in the household.\n\nIsabel comes to stand beside you, and for a long moment, the three of you are simply together—your family, whole and safe for these last hours before you leave.\n\nWhat do you say to them?\n\nThe Morning of Departure - March 18, 1433\n\nDawn breaks cold and clear over Toledo. Your escort is assembled in the main courtyard—Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles with the royal guard, fifty crusaders carrying the banner, various officials and servants for the journey. The horses stamp and snort in the morning chill, their breath steaming.\n\nYou're mounted on your warhorse, wearing traveling clothes and your commander's clasp. The True Cross fragment and Santiago's bone rest in their reliquaries, carefully packed for the journey to Granada and eventually Rome.\n\nIsabel stands on the steps with Catalina in her arms. Your wife is wrapped in a heavy cloak against the cold, her pregnancy visible beneath it. She's not crying—she promised herself she wouldn't—but her eyes are bright.\n\nCatalina is crying, though. She's reaching for you, not understanding why Papa is on the tall horse instead of holding her. \"Papa! Papa!\" Her little voice breaks your heart.\n\nIsabel holds her tighter and raises one hand in farewell. Around the courtyard, servants and courtiers have gathered to see their king depart. Álvaro stands beside Isabel—your constable, your advisor, your friend who will protect your family while you're gone.\n\nThe captain of the guard looks to you, awaiting the order to move out."

Some weather challenges, perhaps a day or two of rain, but nothing dramatic. Arrive on schedule (around March 28, given departure on March 18 and ~10 days travel). Normal administrative matters awaiting but nothing urgent. This gives Juan time to process leaving his family, pray, plan for the Te Deum, and arrive ready to work.\n\nI should keep this relatively brief since it's a routine journey - maybe 4-5 paragraphs covering the highlights without dragging it out. Focus on:\n1. The journey itself - weather, minor challenges\n2. Juan's internal state after leaving family\n3. Practical planning discussions\n4. Arrival in Granada and what awaits\n\nTHE JOURNEY TO GRANADA\n\nMarch 18-28, 1433\n\nThe journey south from Toledo follows the familiar route you traveled three years ago as a newly crowned king seeking papal backing for a crusade that seemed impossible. Now you return to Granada not as a hopeful supplicant but as the conqueror who achieved what seven centuries of kings could not.\n\nThe weather is typical for March—some days clear and mild, others gray with rain that turns the roads to mud and slows progress. You lose a day to particularly heavy storms near the Despeñaperros pass, sheltering in a monastery while water sheets down from the mountains. Another half-day is lost when one of the supply wagons loses a wheel and requires repair. Nothing serious, but enough minor delays that you arrive in Granada exactly on schedule rather than early: March 28, ten days after leaving Toledo.\n\nThe journey gives you time to think. Time to process the ache of leaving Isabel pregnant and Catalina crying. Time to pray. You spend mornings riding in silence with the crusader banner guard, the True Cross and Santiago's bone traveling under careful watch. Evenings you discuss Te Deum preparations with your officials—guest arrangements, ceremony order, diplomatic protocols for receiving the other Iberian monarchs.\n\nCaptain Fernán rides beside you for part of one day. \"Your Majesty seems quieter than usual,\" he observes.\n\n\"I left my daughter crying for me,\" you reply. \"And my wife five months pregnant. It never gets easier, Fernán.\"\n\n\"No, Your Majesty. But it's the price of being king. They understand that, even young Catalina in her own way.\"\n\nIn the towns along the route, people come out to see you pass. Word of the Reconquista's completion has spread throughout Castile. In one village, an old woman kneels as you ride by, making the sign of the cross and weeping. \"Thank you,\" she calls out. \"Thank you for finishing what my grandfather fought for.\"\n\nYou arrive at Granada's gates on the evening of March 28. The Alhambra rises above the city in the fading light, its red walls glowing in the sunset. Don García López de Padilla meets you with a formal guard of honor.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he bows. \"Welcome to Granada. The city is prepared for your arrival and the upcoming ceremony.\"\n\n\"Any issues requiring immediate attention?\" you ask as you dismount.\n\n\"Several administrative matters, Your Majesty, but nothing urgent. The fortress commanders you summoned have been arriving—most have already sworn fealty without incident. The three Sierra Nevada commanders...\" he pauses. \"Two have complied fully. The third, Commander Yahya ibn Nasir of Castell de Ferro, arrived yesterday. He has sworn the oath but has requested private audience with you. He was... careful to comply with the letter of your summons, but I sense he has concerns he wishes to discuss.\"\n\nStandard administrative complexity. Nothing catastrophic, just the normal friction of governing newly conquered territory.\n\n\"And the preparations for the Te Deum?\"\n\n\"Proceeding well. The cathedral is being prepared. Guest quarters in the Alhambra are ready for the visiting monarchs. The city is eager to host such a gathering—it will be the first time all the Christian rulers of Iberia have gathered in Granada.\"\n\nYou nod, bone-tired from ten days of travel but satisfied. You're here. You have two weeks before the ceremony to handle administrative matters, brief Commander Martín and Fernando about their North African mission, deal with Commander Yahya's concerns, and prepare to receive kings.\n\nSTATUS UPON ARRIVAL IN GRANADA\n\nDate: March 28, 1433 (Evening)\nLocation: Granada, Alhambra Palace\n\nImmediate Matters:\n\nCommander Yahya ibn Nasir requests private audience (has sworn fealty but has concerns)\n\nTe Deum ceremony preparations ongoing\n\nGuest quarters being prepared for visiting monarchs\n\nCommander Martín and Fernando in city, awaiting briefing on North African mission\n\nTimeline to Te Deum: Approximately 2 weeks (early April)\n\nExpected Guests:\n\nKing João I of Portugal with sons Duarte and Henrique (confirmed attending)\n\nInfante Juan de Aragón, King of Navarre (high probability)\n\nInfante Enrique de Aragón (high probability)\n\nKing Alfonso V of Aragón (moderate probability)\n\nWhat do you do first in Granada?"

Don García mentioned that most have already sworn fealty, including Commander Yahya ibn Nasir of Castell de Ferro who \"complied with the letter of your summons\" but requested private audience because he has concerns.\n\nThis is an important diplomatic/governance moment. Juan is establishing authority over the newly conquered Granada territories. The commanders have mostly submitted, but Yahya is trying to negotiate special terms.\n\nJuan wants to meet them all together first, including Yahya. This is smart - he's showing he's accessible and willing to meet with them, but also that he's not going to give special private audiences before establishing his authority publicly.\n\nI should describe the scene of the fortress commanders assembled. Most have submitted peacefully. Yahya is present but clearly has something on his mind. Juan needs to decide how to handle this - does he address them collectively first, or does he immediately grant Yahya's request for private audience?\n\nLet me set the scene with the commanders assembled, describe who they are, and then stop for Juan to decide how to proceed.\n\nThe next morning, March 29, you hold audience in the Hall of the Ambassadors within the Alhambra. The magnificent chamber with its carved cedar ceiling and intricate tile work serves as a reminder that this palace was built by Muslim kings who ruled here for centuries. Now it hosts a Christian king receiving the submission of their successors.\n\nDon García has assembled the fortress commanders. Fifteen men stand before you—the military leaders who held Granada's mountain fortresses, its coastal strongholds, its strategic passes. Some are grizzled veterans who fought against your crusade. Others are younger, promoted hastily when their predecessors fell or fled. All wear a mix of traditional Moorish clothing and practical military gear. All have sworn the oath of fealty you required.\n\nDon García introduces them one by one. Most are routine—commanders who understand their position and have submitted without complication. They kneel, reaffirm their oaths, and you acknowledge their service. The choreography of conquest and submission.\n\nThen he comes to the final three—the Sierra Nevada commanders who initially delayed.\n\n\"Commander Ismail al-Haddad of Lanjarón fortress,\" Don García announces. A man in his fifties, weathered face, cautious eyes. He kneels smoothly. \"Your Majesty, I reaffirm my oath. Lanjarón stands ready to serve the crown.\" No complications. He understands the new reality.\n\n\"Commander Yusuf ibn Tariq of Órgiva fortress.\" Younger, maybe thirty-five, beard still dark. He kneels as well. \"Your Majesty, I pledge my loyalty and the loyalty of my garrison. We will serve faithfully.\" Also straightforward.\n\n\"And Commander Yahya ibn Nasir of Castell de Ferro.\"\n\nThis one is different. Mid-forties, lean and alert, with the bearing of a man who has commanded soldiers for decades. He kneels like the others, but there's something in his posture—not defiance exactly, but... reserve. He meets your eyes directly.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says in clear Castilian with only slight accent. \"I have sworn the oath your governor required. Castell de Ferro acknowledges your sovereignty. I stand ready to serve.\" He pauses, then adds carefully: \"And I have requested audience to discuss how best that service might be rendered.\"\n\nThere it is. He's complied—technically—but he wants to negotiate terms. You can feel the attention of the other commanders shifting to this moment. How you handle this will set the precedent for all of them.\n\nWhat do you do?"

          "text": "SUCCESS FACTORS:\n1. Juan's physical gesture of clasping shoulders and raising him up - shows respect, not treating him as conquered enemy\n2. Compliment on his Castilian - genuine recognition of his skill and effort to communicate\n3. \"Ending the war that has ravaged these lands\" - frames them as peacemakers, not defeated enemies\n4. \"Up to me to keep the peace\" - takes personal responsibility, doesn't blame them\n5. \"Welcome your initiative\" - frames their concerns as constructive, not problematic\n6. \"I promise you, I take your ideas seriously\" - genuine commitment to listening\n7. Juan's established reputation for treating converted Muslims well (Commander Martín, Fernando)\n8. Juan's track record of keeping promises and showing mercy\n9. The fact that Juan actually came to Granada personally to meet them\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n1. They are defeated enemies, their sovereign expelled, their faith now ruled by Christians\n2. Uncertainty about their future - will they be replaced by Christian commanders?\n3. Fear for their families and communities\n4. Pride - some may see negotiation as weakness or collaboration\n5. Distrust - Christians have not always kept promises to Muslims historically\n6. Commander Yahya specifically tried to negotiate rather than submit immediately - may have undermined his position with the others\n7. Some commanders may have fought against Juan's forces and lost men\n8. Economic concerns - how will they be paid, what happens to their estates?\n9. Religious pressure - will they be forced to convert?\n\nThis is a persuasion roll where Juan's approach is very good - respectful, welcoming, taking their concerns seriously. The factors will persist across the roll spectrum, but how they manifest will change.\n\nLow rolls: Failure factors dominate - they're suspicious, see it as manipulation, someone speaks up with hostility\nMid rolls: Mixed - some appreciate it, others still wary, creates opening for discussion but concerns remain\nHigh rolls: Success factors resonate - they're moved by the respect, see genuine opportunity, Commander Yahya and others open up constructively\n\nLet me create the table following the persuasion roll format.\n\nI'll create a d100 table for this persuasion moment. First, let me identify the key factors:\n\nSUCCESS/FAILURE FACTORS ANALYSIS\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (Present at all roll levels):\n\nJuan's physical gesture of respect (clasping shoulders, raising him up)\n\nGenuine compliment on Yahya's Castilian language skills\n\nFraming them as peacemakers who \"ended the war,\" not defeated enemies\n\nPersonal responsibility for keeping peace (\"up to me\")\n\nWelcoming their initiative as constructive, not problematic\n\nPromise to take their ideas seriously\n\nJuan's established reputation with Commander Martín and Fernando (treated converted Muslims with dignity)\n\nJuan came personally to Granada to meet them\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (Present at all roll levels):\n\nThey are defeated commanders serving conqueror who expelled their Sultan\n\nUncertainty about future - will Christian commanders replace them?\n\nFear for families and communities under Christian rule\n\nPride - some may see negotiation as weakness or collaboration with conquerors\n\nHistorical distrust - Christians haven't always kept promises to Muslims\n\nCommander Yahya tried to negotiate terms - may have undermined position with others\n\nReligious pressure concerns - will they be forced to convert?\n\nEconomic uncertainty - pay, estates, garrison support unclear\n\nD100 TABLE: FORTRESS COMMANDERS' REACTION\n\nRoll Result | Outcome Summary\n\n1-20: Hostile reception - Success factors acknowledged but failure factors dominate conversation. One older commander speaks up angrily: \"Fine words, but we know what Christian rule means.\" Yahya tries to salvage situation but others now suspicious he's collaborating. Several commanders visibly uncomfortable. Approach seen as manipulation rather than genuine respect. They comply because they must, but meeting becomes tense negotiation with defenders empowered.\n\n21-40: Cool, wary reception - Your gestures noted but distrust prominent. Commanders exchange glances, uncertain. Yahya appreciates respect but hesitates to speak freely. Another commander asks bluntly: \"Will we keep our commands, or are Christian lords replacing us?\" Concerns about forced conversion raised directly. Your good intentions recognized but not yet trusted. Opens difficult negotiation, not easy conversation.\n\n41-60: Mixed, cautious reception - Some commanders visibly moved by respect shown; others remain guarded. Yahya clearly wants to engage but watching others' reactions first. One younger commander says carefully: \"Your words give hope, Your Majesty, but we've served defeated kingdom. What does that mean for our futures?\" Balanced discussion possible. Your reputation helps but doesn't erase all fears. Real conversation can happen but concerns must be addressed seriously.\n\n61-80: Positive, respectful reception - Your approach resonates. Several commanders relax visibly at physical gesture and tone. Yahya meets your eyes with cautious hope. Another commander says: \"We've heard of Commander Martín and how you treated him. Perhaps...\" trails off but implication clear. Your reputation for keeping promises acknowledged. Concerns still exist but raised constructively by men willing to believe in possibility. Creates collaborative atmosphere.\n\n81-95: Very warm reception - Physical gesture breaks tension immediately. Multiple commanders visibly moved by being treated as valued servants rather than defeated enemies. Yahya speaks up with genuine respect: \"Your Majesty, we did not expect this reception. May I speak freely?\" Others nod encouragement. Commander Ismail: \"My men have spoken of how you treated Alcalá's garrison. That is why we are here.\" Your track record gives them confidence. Discussion becomes constructive problem-solving session.\n\n96-100: Exceptional reception - The moment transforms the room. When you clasp Yahya's shoulders, you see tears in the older commander's eyes. Commander Ismail steps forward unbidden: \"Your Majesty, I fought against your forces at Málaga. I lost good men. But I've never seen a conqueror treat the conquered with such dignity.\" Yahya finds his voice: \"I requested audience fearing I must negotiate for my men's survival. Instead you welcome our counsel?\" Several commanders exchange looks of wonder. Your reputation and personal bearing create genuine trust. They open up completely about concerns, seeing opportunity rather than threat.\n\nThe table reflects how your genuine respect and Juan's established reputation play across the roll spectrum. Even low rolls acknowledge the gesture's legitimacy—what changes is whether failure factors (distrust, fear, pride) dominate the conversation or whether success factors (reputation, respect, track record) create collaborative atmosphere.\n\nPlease roll your physical d100."

          "text": "Given the quality of this approach, the MOST LIKELY outcome should be quite positive. The middle of the bell curve (40-60 range) should reflect that this was a good approach.\n\nLet me create a more realistic distribution:\n\n1-5: Something goes badly wrong despite good approach - maybe one commander has personal grudge, or misinterprets gesture\n6-15: One or two commanders react poorly, drag others into suspicion\n16-30: Wary but starting to trust - good approach acknowledged but concerns remain prominent\n31-70: This should be the fat middle - various shades of POSITIVE reception because Juan's approach was genuinely good. The variation should be in HOW positive and what specific concerns get raised\n71-85: Very positive, commanders open up significantly\n86-95: Exceptional - breakthrough moment\n96-100: Remarkable - something unexpected and very positive happens\n\nThe key is that 31-70 (40% of outcomes) should all be fundamentally positive because Juan's approach deserved that. The variation is in details, not in whether it worked.\n\nYou're absolutely right. Let me completely redraft this based on the actual quality of Juan's approach, which was genuinely good - respectful, welcoming, and backed by his track record with Martín and Fernando.\n\nD100 TABLE: FORTRESS COMMANDERS' REACTION\n\n(Realistic distribution based on approach quality)\n\n1-5: Personal grudge derails moment - One commander (not Yahya) has brother who died at Málaga. Despite your good approach, he can't contain himself: \"Easy words from the man who killed my brother!\" Others try to calm him but damage done - meeting becomes tense damage control.\n\n6-15: Suspicious misinterpretation - Yahya stiffens when you grasp his shoulders, misreads it as threat or condescension. \"I have already sworn, Your Majesty. What more do you require?\" Others pick up on his defensiveness. Your good intentions acknowledged but atmosphere becomes formal and distant. Must work harder to rebuild trust.\n\n16-30: Cautiously positive but concerns prominent - Commanders appreciate gesture and recognize sincerity, but years of war aren't erased easily. Yahya: \"Your words are welcome, Your Majesty. We have heard of Commander Martín. But we must speak plainly - will Christian lords replace us? What of our families?\" Respectful but direct questions. Foundation for trust exists but much work ahead.\n\n31-45: Good reception, practical focus - Your approach works. Visible relief in the room. Yahya: \"Thank you, Your Majesty. That gives me courage to speak.\" He raises practical concerns: garrison pay, command authority, how conversion pressure will be handled. Others nod and add their own questions. Constructive atmosphere - they believe you'll listen and discuss honestly.\n\n46-60: Warm reception, collaborative tone - Multiple commanders visibly moved by physical gesture. Commander Ismail steps forward: \"Your Majesty, we've heard how you treated Alcalá's garrison. That is why we trusted your summons.\" Yahya more confident: \"I requested audience worried about my position. Now I see we can discuss how to serve well together.\" Others contribute ideas. Real dialogue opens.\n\n61-75: Very positive, genuine trust building - The room transforms. Yahya meets your eyes with real hope: \"May I speak freely, Your Majesty?\" When you nod, he continues: \"My men are afraid. Not of you personally - your reputation preceded you - but of what Christian rule means. Can we discuss this?\" Others agree earnestly. Commander Yusuf: \"If you truly want our counsel, we have much to share about governing these mountains.\" They're ready to work with you.\n\n76-85: Excellent reception, commanders open completely - Your gesture breaks down walls. An older commander speaks up: \"I am Rashid ibn Malik of Trevélez fortress, Your Majesty. I was not summoned but came because I heard you meet us yourself.\" Others look surprised he's here. \"That speaks louder than any proclamation. What do you need from us to keep these mountains peaceful?\" They're already thinking as your servants, not defeated enemies.\n\n86-95: Exceptional - breakthrough moment - When you clasp Yahya's shoulders, something shifts in the entire room. He says quietly: \"Commander Martín told me about you. I didn't believe him. I thought he was... trying to justify his choice. But you are as he described.\" Commander Ismail: \"We surrender not just our fortresses but our knowledge. These mountains, these people - we can help you govern them well if you trust us.\" Offer goes beyond submission to partnership.\n\n96-100: Remarkable - one commander converts on the spot - Everything above happens, but then the youngest commander - Ibrahim al-Sharif of Cádiar, barely thirty - steps forward and kneels differently. \"Your Majesty, I would hear more of your faith. Not as condition of service, but... Commander Martín spoke of what moved him at Alcalá. I have seen God's judgment on Granada. I would understand the Cross you carry.\" The other Muslim commanders are shocked but don't object. This wasn't expected by anyone including you.\n\nThis table reflects:\n\nMost likely outcome (31-75, 45% of results): Your good approach works, creating positive reception with various specific focuses\n\nLower probability (16-30, 15%): Works but concerns prominent, must address directly\n\nUnlikely but possible (6-15, 10%): Misread despite good intentions\n\nVery unlikely (1-5, 5%): Personal circumstances override good approach\n\nUpper ranges (76-100, 25%): Increasingly exceptional positive outcomes\n\nThe quality of your approach makes positive outcomes most probable. Roll determines HOW positive and what specific dynamics emerge, not WHETHER it works.\n\nPlease roll your physical d100."

According to the table:\n\n\"Commanders appreciate gesture and recognize sincerity, but years of war aren't erased easily. Yahya: 'Your words are welcome, Your Majesty. We have heard of Commander Martín. But we must speak plainly - will Christian lords replace us? What of our families?' Respectful but direct questions. Foundation for trust exists but much work ahead.\"\n\nThis is a realistic outcome - Juan's approach is good and they appreciate it, but they're not going to immediately open up completely. They're being cautious but constructive. They've heard about how Juan treated Commander Martín, which gives them some hope, but they have legitimate concerns they need addressed.\n\nI need to:\n1. Show the commanders appreciating Juan's gesture\n2. Have Yahya respond positively but with real concerns\n3. Have other commanders add their concerns\n4. Keep it respectful and constructive, not hostile\n5. Show that the foundation for trust exists but Juan needs to address their legitimate fears\n6. Make it clear this is about years of war and legitimate uncertainty, not rejection of Juan's approach\n\nThe scene should feel like: \"We appreciate this, we've heard good things, but we need to hear specifics before we can truly trust.\"\n\nTHE FORTRESS COMMANDERS RESPOND\n\nWhen you clasp Commander Yahya's shoulders and raise him to his feet, you feel him relax slightly—the gesture is understood and appreciated. Around the hall, several of the commanders exchange glances. The tension doesn't disappear, but it shifts.\n\nYahya meets your eyes and inclines his head respectfully. \"Your words are welcome, Your Majesty. Truly.\" He pauses, choosing words carefully. \"We have heard... stories. Commander Martín de Alcalá speaks of you with respect that surprised many of us. Fernando the converted qadi—some of us knew Ahmad al-Zarqali when he served Granada. That such men would follow you willingly...\" He trails off, then continues more firmly. \"It gives us hope that this summons was not merely formality before replacement.\"\n\nThere it is. The core concern laid bare.\n\nCommander Ismail al-Haddad from Lanjarón steps forward slightly. He's older, perhaps fifty-five, with gray in his beard. \"Your Majesty, may I speak plainly?\" When you nod, he continues. \"We have sworn our oaths. We will keep them. But we have families in these fortresses. Men who served under us for years. We need to understand...\" He hesitates, then pushes forward. \"Will Christian lords be appointed to replace us? Are we holding these fortresses until your nobles arrive to claim them?\"\n\nCommander Yusuf ibn Tariq from Órgiva adds: \"And our men, Your Majesty. The garrisons. Will they remain, or will Christian soldiers replace them? Some have already asked if they should send their families away while they still can.\"\n\nYahya seizes on this opening. \"These are the questions I hoped to discuss in private audience, Your Majesty. Not because I doubt your word, but because clarity serves everyone. My men need to know if they have futures here. If their children will grow up in these mountains or if they should prepare to leave.\"\n\nAnother commander—you don't know his name yet—speaks up. \"We have heard of the conversions at Alcalá. We respect Commander Martín's choice. But must we convert to keep our positions? To protect our families?\" His voice is careful, not challenging but genuinely uncertain. \"Some of us have considered it. Others...\" He glances at his fellow commanders. \"Others need to understand what is required and what is... voluntary.\"\n\nThe hall is quiet. They're not hostile—your gesture and reputation have earned you that much. But these are men who watched their Sultan defeated, their kingdom conquered, their world overturned. They need more than warm words. They need specifics.\n\nYahya speaks again, and there's something almost apologetic in his tone. \"Your Majesty, you welcomed our initiative. You promised to take our ideas seriously. Then allow me to be direct: we can serve you well. We know these mountains, these people, these fortress systems better than any Christian lord you might appoint. We can keep the peace you speak of maintaining. But we need to know—\" He spreads his hands. \"—what kind of service you envision. Are we temporary caretakers? Are we subjects with a future? Or are we defeated enemies awaiting replacement?\"\n\nThe other commanders are watching you intently now. Your physical gesture and welcoming words have opened the door, but you haven't yet walked through it. They need answers, not just respect.\n\nCommander Ismail adds quietly: \"Commander Martín told some of us: 'The king keeps his promises.' We are here because we hope that is true. But we have seen many rulers make promises during conquest that...\" He doesn't finish the sentence. He doesn't need to.\n\nThe foundation for trust exists in this room—your treatment of Commander Martín and Fernando has given you that. But years of war aren't erased by a single gesture. These men need to hear specifics about their futures, their families, their faith, their positions before they can truly open up to you.\n\nWhat do you tell them?"

They may BE those nobles or related to them. This could sound like their class is being destroyed\n2. The conversion incentive (faith rewarded with position) could be seen as coercive even if framed as voluntary\n3. \"Rise above their station\" - implies they're currently low station, which might sting for proud commanders\n4. Morocco delegation is opportunity for SOME but not all 15 commanders\n5. \"Tomorrow\" language is vague - when exactly do these opportunities materialize?\n6. No specifics on garrison pay, command authority, family safety - the practical questions\n7. Christianity as \"law of the land\" with churches - they need to know what this means practically\n\n**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**\nThis is a mixed message. The good parts (no forced conversion, no replacement) are VERY good. But the casual mention of redistributing Muslim noble titles is devastating news delivered almost as an aside. The offer of opportunity is real but limited (Morocco delegation won't employ all of them). The conversion incentive, while stated as voluntary, creates pressure.\n\nMost likely outcome: They appreciate the clarity and honesty, but the news about noble titles is a blow. Some will see opportunity, others will see their world ending despite being told they're keeping their jobs.\n\nI'll map out a nuanced probability distribution of potential reactions:\n\n- Extreme negative reaction (10%): Total rejection of changes, seeing noble title redistribution as complete social destruction\n- Cautious skepticism (20%): Deep concern about status and future, but willing to listen\n- Pragmatic adaptation (35%): Seeing potential opportunities while carefully weighing risks\n- Optimistic engagement (20%): Viewing changes as potential path to advancement and new possibilities\n\nThe percentages reflect the complex emotional landscape of a group facing fundamental social transformation, balancing personal dignity with survival instincts.\n\nI'll analyze Juan's response and create a realistic table based on its actual quality.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n\nDirect answers to core questions (no forced conversion, no replacement)\n\nHonest about difficult changes (Christianity law of land, noble titles redistributed)\n\nConcrete opportunity offered (Morocco delegation)\n\nClear framework: loyalty→trust, faith→position\n\nAcknowledges mutual adjustment period\n\nWEAKNESSES:\n\n\"Muslim nobles who held titles distributed among crusaders\" - devastating news delivered almost casually\n\nConversion incentive creates pressure despite \"voluntary\" framing\n\n\"Rise above station\" might offend proud commanders\n\nMorocco delegation helps SOME, not all 15 men here\n\nNo specifics on pay, authority, family safety - their practical questions\n\nD100 TABLE: COMMANDERS' RESPONSE TO JUAN'S ANSWER\n\n1-8: Title redistribution triggers anger - Commander from noble family reacts sharply: \"So my cousin loses his estates to crusaders while I keep my fortress? For how long, Your Majesty? Until a Christian lord wants it?\" Others shift uncomfortably. Yahya tries to salvage situation but the blow about noble titles has landed hard. Meeting becomes tense.\n\n9-20: Conversion incentive feels coercive - Yahya speaks carefully: \"Your Majesty, you say conversion is voluntary. But you also say faith is rewarded with position. That is... not quite voluntary, is it?\" Commander Ismail: \"Our families will hear 'convert to advance' as 'convert to survive.'\" Appreciate honesty but troubled by implications. Respectful but concerned atmosphere.\n\n21-35: Grateful for clarity but focus on losses - \"You answer our questions directly. That is more than we expected.\" Pause. \"But Muslim nobility destroyed, our world ending even as we keep our commands...\" Commander Yusuf: \"For now we keep them. But when Christian lords look at these fortresses...\" Trails off. They see writing on wall despite promises. Subdued reception.\n\n36-55: Mixed feelings, practical questions emerge - Yahya: \"Thank you for directness, Your Majesty. No forced conversion is significant.\" But another commander: \"What of garrison pay? Command authority? If Christian soldiers arrive, who commands?\" They appreciate framework but need details. Commander Ismail: \"Morocco delegation serves some. What of the rest of us?\" Want to believe but uncertain.\n\n56-70: Cautiously hopeful, appreciate honesty - \"You could have lied to us,\" Commander Yusuf says. \"Promised everything would stay the same. Instead you tell truth even when hard.\" Yahya nods: \"Commander Martín said you keep promises. This proves it - you promise only what you will do.\" Still concerns about noble titles, but framework of loyalty→trust resonates. Foundation for working relationship.\n\n71-82: Focus on opportunity offered - Yahya straightens: \"Morocco delegation - when does it depart? What would service entail?\" Another commander: \"You speak of earning opportunity. What does that look like?\" Commander Ismail: \"My nephew considered conversion after Málaga fell. Your framework helps me understand why.\" They're thinking practically about futures within new system rather than mourning old one.\n\n83-92: Appreciate fairness given circumstances - Older commander speaks up: \"Your Majesty, we are defeated enemies. You could have replaced us with Christian lords and none could protest. Instead you offer us chance to serve and advance.\" Yahya: \"The noble titles... that is hard truth. But you tell us honestly. And you offer real opportunity in Morocco, in service.\" Several nod. \"We can work with this.\"\n\n93-97: Commander volunteers for Morocco immediately - Yahya steps forward: \"Your Majesty, I requested audience to negotiate terms. You've given me something better - purpose. I volunteer for Morocco delegation. I know those coasts, speak their dialects. Let me prove what Muslim service to Christian crown can achieve.\" Another commander: \"If there's room for two...\" They see genuine opportunity.\n\n98-100: Unexpected endorsement from respected voice - Commander Ismail, the oldest, speaks with authority: \"I am fifty-six years old. I fought Christians my whole life. I watched our Sultan fall, our kingdom end.\" He pauses. \"But I've also watched how you treat Commander Martín, how you speak to us now. My men asked if they should flee. I will tell them: stay. Serve faithfully. This king rewards loyalty with trust - I believe that.\" Others visibly moved by elder's endorsement. Changes room's entire atmosphere.\n\nDistribution reflects:\n\nMost likely (36-70, 35%): Mixed but cautiously positive - appreciate honesty, concerned about practicalities\n\nModerate probability (21-35 & 71-82, 27%): Either focusing on losses or focusing on opportunities\n\nLower probability (9-20, 12%): Troubled by coercion implications despite good intentions\n\nUnlikely negative (1-8, 8%): Personal circumstances trigger anger\n\nUpper ranges (83-100, 18%): Increasingly positive focus on fairness and opportunity\n\nYour honest but mixed message makes cautiously hopeful outcomes most probable. The hard truth about noble titles prevents this from being purely positive response.\n\nPlease roll your physical d100."

          "text": "Rolled 67, which falls in the 56-70 range: \"Cautiously hopeful, appreciate honesty\"\n\nThe commanders appreciate Juan's directness and honesty, even when it's hard truth. The framework of loyalty→trust resonates. Yahya specifically references Commander Martín saying Juan keeps promises, and this proves it - he promises only what he will do. There are still concerns about noble titles being redistributed, but the overall foundation for a working relationship is established.\n\nI should write this response showing:\n1. Yahya leading with appreciation for honesty\n2. The reference to Commander Martín's assessment proven correct\n3. Acknowledgment that the noble title news is hard but appreciated for its truthfulness\n4. The framework of loyalty→trust resonating with them\n5. Still some concerns but willingness to work within the new system\n6. Foundation for working relationship established\n7. Maybe some practical follow-up questions showing they're engaging constructively\n\nThis should feel like cautious hope - not euphoric, not despairing, but pragmatic men deciding they can work with this king even as their world changes.\n\nCAUTIOUS HOPE\n\nThere's a long moment of silence after you finish speaking. The commanders exchange glances, processing what you've said—both the reassurances and the harder truths.\n\nYahya is the first to speak. \"Your Majesty...\" He chooses his words carefully. \"You could have told us everything would remain as it was. Made promises you had no intention of keeping.\" He glances at the other commanders. \"Commander Martín told me: 'The king keeps his promises because he promises only what he will do.' I thought that was... diplomacy. A way of justifying his choice.\" He pauses. \"But you just proved him right. You promise no forced conversion—and I believe you. You promise we keep our commands—and I believe that too. But you do not promise the world stays unchanged, because it cannot.\"\n\nCommander Ismail nods slowly. \"The noble titles... that is hard news. My cousin held estates near Guadix. He fled to Morocco when the city fell.\" His voice is steady but you can hear the weight behind it. \"To know those lands go to crusaders now...\" He trails off, then continues more firmly. \"But you tell us this honestly rather than let us discover it later. That matters, Your Majesty. Truth even when hard—that is the foundation we can build on.\"\n\nAnother commander—a younger man you haven't been introduced to—speaks up. \"Your Majesty, you speak of loyalty rewarded with trust. What does that look like in practice? I command Poqueira fortress with thirty men. If I serve faithfully, if my men keep peace in those valleys, what changes for us?\" It's not challenging—it's practical, a man trying to understand how to navigate this new reality.\n\nCommander Yusuf from Órgiva adds: \"And the Morocco delegation—how many men? What timeline? Some of us...\" He glances at Yahya. \"...would serve in such capacity if opportunity exists.\"\n\nYahya meets your eyes directly. \"Your Majesty, you say faith rewarded with position but conversion between soul and God. I understand the distinction you're making. And I...\" He hesitates, vulnerability showing for the first time. \"I watched sixteen thousand men die at Alcalá. I've thought much about divine judgment since. Commander Martín's choice was not cowardice as some claimed. I see that now.\" He doesn't commit to conversion, but he's clearly wrestling with it.\n\nThe older Commander Ismail speaks again, and there's almost a paternal quality to his voice. \"Your Majesty is young. Twenty years old, yes?\" When you nod, he continues. \"I have sons older than you. I've served three sultans. I know when a ruler speaks from calculation and when from conviction.\" He looks around at the other commanders. \"This one speaks conviction. The world changes—that is beyond anyone's control now. But we can choose how we face that change.\"\n\nHe turns back to you. \"We will serve faithfully, Your Majesty. You give us reason to believe faithful service means something in your kingdom. That is more than defeated commanders usually receive.\" Several of the others nod agreement.\n\nThe tension in the hall hasn't disappeared, but it has transformed into something workable. These men aren't celebrating—their world is ending, their Sultan exiled, their nobility dispossessed, their faith no longer the law of their homeland. But they're choosing to see opportunity within tragedy, to believe that service to you might offer futures for them and their families.\n\nCommander Yahya speaks once more. \"The private audience I requested, Your Majesty—I believe it is no longer necessary. You've answered what I needed to know.\" He pauses. \"Though if you wish to discuss Morocco delegation specifics, I remain eager to serve in that capacity.\"\n\nDon García, who has been silent throughout, steps forward. \"Your Majesty, shall I arrange individual meetings with commanders who have specific questions about their fortresses and garrisons? I believe we have established the broader framework.\"\n\nThe foundation is laid. Not perfect, not without concerns, but workable. These men will serve you—not out of fear alone, but because you've given them reason to believe that service might lead somewhere beyond mere survival.\n\nWhat do you do?"

Let me see if any commanders have final questions. Given the roll of 67 (cautiously hopeful), they should have practical questions but nothing hostile or deeply problematic. These would be reasonable follow-up questions from men trying to understand their new reality.\n\nI should keep this relatively brief - maybe 2-3 commanders with quick questions, then wrap the meeting. Juan has done well here, established a workable framework.\n\nCommander Yusuf raises his hand slightly. \"Your Majesty, a practical matter: our garrisons' pay. Currently we operate on... what remains of Granada's treasury systems. Will that continue, or does the crown assume direct payment? My men need to know their wages are secure.\"\n\nAnother commander—one of the younger ones who hasn't spoken yet—asks: \"Your Majesty, what of Muslim merchants and travelers? These mountain passes see trade from the coast. Under Granada, we facilitated safe passage for merchants. Do we continue that function, or are there new rules about who may travel through our territories?\"\n\nCommander Ismail has one more question, and his tone is gentle but serious. \"Your Majesty speaks of serving faithfully and honorably. That is clear. But what if... complications arise? If Christian settlers move into valleys near our fortresses and there are disputes—property boundaries, water rights, the usual frictions—who adjudicates? Do we still handle local governance, or must we defer to Christian authorities even in minor matters?\"\n\nYahya adds quietly: \"And family safety, Your Majesty. You said no one is being replaced. Does that extend to protection? If some...\" he chooses words carefully, \"...if some among the Christian population see us as enemies who deserve no position of authority, will the crown defend our right to serve?\"\n\nThese are the practical questions of military administrators trying to understand how to actually govern in this new reality. Not hostile, but needing specifics beyond the broader framework you've established.\n\nDon García stands ready to take notes on your responses."

Keep the peace, hopefully it's easier now that there is no conflict between Grenada and Castille anymore.\n\n\nHandle disputes with as much grace as possible. The difficult talk we have had just now will be held many times over near farms, churches, fields, roads. Everywhere. Try to keep the peace and to work together with the new christian rule.

Don García should be pleased with how this went. This was a successful diplomatic moment.\n\nCommander Yusuf nods with visible relief. \"We are being paid, Your Majesty, though there was... uncertainty about how long that would continue. Your word settles that concern.\"\n\nCommander Ismail smiles slightly at your response about disputes. \"Grace and mercy. Handle things locally where possible. That is clear guidance, Your Majesty. Better than rigid rules that cannot account for each situation.\" He glances at the other commanders. \"We know these valleys, these people. If you trust us to govern with wisdom, we will prove worthy of that trust.\"\n\nYahya's expression shows the most relief at your final point. \"A royal decree protecting sworn officers from replacement—Your Majesty, that gives us something concrete to show our men. To show our families. It transforms our position from temporary accommodation to legitimate service.\" He bows. \"Thank you.\"\n\nThe younger commander who asked about merchants adds: \"Tax collection, keeping peace, handling disputes with grace—these are tasks we know. It helps to understand we continue governing, not merely holding fortresses until others arrive.\"\n\nCommander Ismail speaks for the group one final time. \"Your Majesty has answered our questions with directness and given us authority to govern with judgment rather than rigid orders. We came here uncertain. We leave knowing where we stand and what is expected.\" He looks around at his fellow commanders. \"I believe I speak for all when I say: you will have our faithful service.\"\n\nThe others murmur agreement. The atmosphere in the hall has completely transformed from the cautious tension of an hour ago. These are men who understand they can work within this new system.\n\nDon García steps forward. \"Your Majesty, shall I coordinate with these commanders regarding the Morocco delegation assembly tomorrow? Those interested can present their credentials and experience.\"\n\nYahya is already nodding eagerly. At least three other commanders look interested as well.\n\nWhat do you do?"

This is a significant moment as they're all assembled together, presumably in Granada where the campaign ended. Some key facts:\n\n1. Started with ~575 at the wedding (February 1431)\n2. Grew to ~800-900 during campaign, then deliberately limited recruitment\n3. Combat casualties over 21 months: ~140 (95 KIA, 30 seriously wounded, 15 disease)\n4. Guardian Company of 50 men protecting True Cross and Santiago's bone\n5. Every single crusader is genuine, proven in 21 months of combat\n6. They're to be released from vows after Rome visit\n7. Will be offered permanent crown army employment (optional)\n8. Annual cost: ~575,000 maravedís in wages\n\nKey figures who would be present:\n- Marco Tornesi (training sergeant)\n- Andrea Vescovi (first crusader sworn, barely 20)\n- Giovanni Rossi (former blacksmith, spiritual anchor)\n- Brother Guillem (Benedictine monk-warrior)\n- Alonso Fernández (former man-at-arms, officer material)\n- Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles\n- Sergeant García\n- Captain Rodrigo\n- Sir Thomas Beaumont (though he might be in Toledo at Military Academy)\n\nThis is likely taking place in Granada, probably in a large plaza or courtyard that can hold ~800 men. The True Cross fragment and Santiago's bone would be present. This is Juan addressing the men who fought with him for 21 months, conquered an entire kingdom, and will soon travel to Rome to return the sacred relics.\n\nThis is a major moment - what does Juan want to say to these men? The user will tell me in their next message.\n\nYou dismiss the fortress commanders with Don García's assistance, instructing him to prepare for tomorrow's Morocco delegation assembly. Then you turn to Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles.\n\n\"Assemble the crusaders. All of them. I want every man who fought under the banner gathered together.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" Fernán bows and departs immediately.\n\nLater that afternoon - Plaza de los Aljibes, Granada\n\nThe great plaza between the Alcazaba fortress and the Alhambra palace fills with men wearing the white cross on red field. Nearly eight hundred crusaders—the survivors of twenty-one months of holy war—form up in their company formations. You see faces you know: Marco Tornesi, the former mercenary who became training sergeant. Andrea Vescovi, the farmer's son who was first to take the oath, now scarred and hardened by campaign. Giovanni Rossi, the blacksmith with the limp and missing fingers, whose nightly prayers kept the army's soul. Brother Guillem, the Benedictine monk-warrior. Alonso Fernández and dozens of others.\n\nThe Guardian Company of fifty stands in place of honor, the reliquaries containing the True Cross fragment and Santiago's bone resting on a draped platform before them. These sacred objects have traveled with you through every battle, every siege, every triumph and loss.\n\nCaptain Fernán, Sergeant García, and Captain Rodrigo stand at attention. The men are silent, waiting. They know something significant is coming—you don't assemble the entire force without reason.\n\nThe afternoon sun slants across the red walls of the Alhambra. In the distance, you can see the Sierra Nevada mountains that these men fought to conquer. The city of Granada spreads below—the jewel that was once Islam's last stronghold in Iberia, now yours.\n\nEight hundred pairs of eyes watch you.\n\nWhat do you say to them?"

He'll never see them.\" Others try to comfort him but several more start weeping for fallen comrades. Emotional moment derails into collective grief. Still ultimately positive but raw and painful.\n\n5-12: Concern about delay - Voice from ranks: \"Why wait months to divide lands? We've earned them now!\" Others murmur agreement. Appreciate promise but frustrated about further waiting. Marco Tornesi has to quiet the grumbling. Positive overall but impatient edge.\n\n13-25: Mixed feelings about ending - Men exchange uncertain glances. Giovanni Rossi speaks up: \"Your Majesty, these lands are generous. But... what if some of us don't want to retire? We've been soldiers for nearly two years now. Some of us longer.\" Others nod. Happy about fulfillment but uncertain about disbanding this brotherhood.\n\n26-45: Warm but bittersweet reception - Andrea Vescovi steps forward, clearly moved by being named first. \"Your Majesty honors me beyond measure.\" But his voice cracks. \"These men are my brothers. We've bled together. And now we... scatter to our lands?\" Applause for your generosity mixed with sadness that this ends. Marco puts hand on Andrea's shoulder.\n\n46-65: Positive, focused on Rome journey - Brother Guillem speaks: \"One more adventure together - carrying the sacred relics home. A fitting end to our crusade.\" Men start nodding. Alonso Fernández: \"To Rome! Together one last time!\" Enthusiasm builds. They're focusing on the journey ahead rather than the ending after. Strong positive energy.\n\n66-80: Enthusiastic about fulfillment - Marco Tornesi calls out: \"Brothers! The king promised us lands when we took the oath. He kept every promise - now he keeps this one!\" Cheering begins. Andrea Vescovi looks overwhelmed that he gets first choice. Giovanni starts praying thanksgiving. Men clap each other on backs. Real joy at mission completion and reward.\n\n81-90: Very strong positive response - The moment Andrea is named first, crusaders start chanting his name. The farmer's son who was first to swear now gets first choice - the symbolism lands powerfully. When you mention equal land values, someone shouts: \"Fair even in victory!\" Cheering builds. \"To Rome! To Rome!\" They're ready for one last march together.\n\n91-96: Crusaders pledge continued service - After initial cheering, Marco Tornesi steps forward: \"Your Majesty, many of us would serve beyond these oaths. The lands are generous - but could some of us take service in the crown army instead? Or in addition?\" Multiple voices agree. Brother Guillem: \"Some of us are called to continue fighting.\" They want the option to keep serving beyond land grants.\n\n97-100: Profound moment of brotherhood affirmed - Andrea Vescovi falls to his knees, weeping with joy and grief mixed together. \"First to swear, first to choose. Your Majesty remembers.\" Giovanni and others gather around him in spontaneous embrace. Then Giovanni begins singing a crusading hymn. All 800 join in - Te Deum Laudamus echoing off Alhambra walls.

          "text": "Rolled 69. That falls in the 66-80 range: \"Enthusiastic about fulfillment - Marco Tornesi calls out: 'Brothers! The king promised us lands when we took the oath. He kept every promise - now he keeps this one!' Cheering begins. Andrea Vescovi looks overwhelmed that he gets first choice. Giovanni starts praying thanksgiving. Men clap each other on backs. Real joy at mission completion and reward.\"\n\nThis is a strongly positive response. The crusaders are enthusiastic about the promise being kept, Andrea is moved by being honored, and there's genuine joy. I should write this with emotional authenticity - these men have fought for 21 months, lost comrades, and now see their reward coming.\n\nTHE CRUSADERS RESPOND\n\nFor a moment after you finish speaking, there's silence. Eight hundred men processing what you've just said—that their oaths are nearly fulfilled, that the lands they were promised are real and documented, that Andrea Vescovi, the farmer's son who was first to take the oath, will have first choice.\n\nThen Marco Tornesi's voice rings out across the plaza. \"Brothers!\" He raises his fist. \"The king promised us lands when we took the oath in Barcelona! Every one of us remembers that day!\" He turns to face you, then back to the men. \"He kept every promise—supplies when we needed them, fair treatment when we were wounded, justice when we were wronged. And now he keeps this one too!\"\n\nCheering erupts. Not wild or chaotic, but deep and heartfelt—the roar of men who have fought together, bled together, and now see the completion of what they started.\n\nAndrea Vescovi stands frozen in his formation, and you can see tears streaming down his face. The gangly farm boy who rode ten days from Florence to Barcelona, who had nothing keeping him home, who was brave enough to be first to kneel before an eighteen-year-old king and swear an oath—he looks completely overwhelmed. The men around him clap his shoulders, push him forward slightly. He takes a few stumbling steps toward you, then drops to one knee.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" his voice breaks. \"I was nobody. A farmer's son with no prospects. You made me first. You remembered.\" He can barely speak through emotion. \"First to swear, first to choose. I... I don't have words for what that means.\"\n\nGiovanni Rossi, the blacksmith with the missing fingers, raises his hands skyward. \"Deus lo vult!\" he calls out—God wills it. Then he begins praying, not the formal Latin liturgy but spontaneous thanksgiving in Italian. \"Blessed be God who brought us through fire and sword to this day! Who kept our king safe! Who brings us home with honor!\"\n\nOther crusaders join in the prayer, a wave of thanksgiving rolling through the formation. Some in Latin, some in Castilian, some in Italian, some in German—a babel of languages united in gratitude.\n\nBrother Guillem steps forward, his monk's composure cracking slightly. \"Your Majesty speaks of one more adventure—to Rome with the sacred relics. A fitting end.\" His voice strengthens. \"We began this crusade carrying the True Cross and Santiago's bone. We end it by returning them home, mission accomplished. Brothers, could there be a more perfect completion?\"\n\n\"To Rome!\" someone shouts. Others take up the cry. \"To Rome! To Rome!\" Not a demand but an eager affirmation—yes, we're with you one last time.\n\nAlonso Fernández, the former man-at-arms who could have been officer material, calls out: \"Your Majesty says the assessors made the lands equal in value! Fair even in victory!\" More cheering. These are men who have watched nobles divide spoils unfairly, who know how easily rewards can be corrupted. Your promise of equality resonates.\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso de Robles, standing near you, has moisture in his eyes. Sergeant García and Captain Rodrigo are grinning openly. They've led these men through twenty-one months of war—they know what this moment means.\n\nMarco Tornesi raises his voice again to be heard over the celebration. \"Brothers! Look around! We came from Florence, from Milan, from Castile, from Barcelona, from Genoa, from France, from Germany! Different kingdoms, different tongues! But we fought as one!\" He points to the True Cross reliquary. \"Under that banner, we conquered Granada! We finished what seven centuries of kings could not! And now we carry those relics home together—one last march!\"\n\nThe cheering intensifies. Men start embracing each other, the rigid formations dissolving into spontaneous celebration. You see crusaders who fought side by side at Málaga, who stormed walls together at Loja, who stood shield to shield through twenty-one months of brotherhood, clapping each other's backs and laughing.\n\nAndrea Vescovi finally rises from his knee, still weeping but smiling now. Several men near him start chanting his name: \"An-dre-a! An-dre-a!\" It spreads through the formation—celebrating not just him but what he represents: that the first shall be first, that a farmer's son can rise, that Juan II keeps his promises.\n\nGiovanni Rossi's voice rises above the noise, beginning to sing—not a war song but a hymn: \"Te Deum laudamus, te Dominum confitemur...\" We praise thee, O God, we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.\n\nWithin moments, eight hundred voices join in the Latin hymn. The sound echoes off the red walls of the Alhambra, fills the plaza, rises toward the Sierra Nevada mountains they conquered together. Some men sing through tears. Others stand at attention, voices strong. But all sing—a crusading army giving thanks for victory, for survival, for the sacred trust that brought them here.\n\nWhen the hymn ends, the plaza falls quiet again. Marco Tornesi speaks once more, his voice carrying clearly. \"Your Majesty asks: are we with you one last time?\" He grins. \"Your Majesty, we've followed you through every battle, every siege, every hardship. One more journey to Rome?\" He looks around at the men. \"Brothers, are we with our king?\"\n\n\"YES!\" The roar shakes the plaza. \"TO ROME! TO ROME!\"\n\nYou stand before them—these eight hundred men who took sacred oaths, who fought your holy war, who believed in your crusade when it seemed impossible. They're ready for one more march together. One final adventure before they scatter to their lands and the brotherhood dissolves into memory.\n\nCaptain Fernán steps close and murmurs: \"Your Majesty, they would follow you anywhere. Even after Rome, if you asked.\"\n\nThe crusaders are with you. Enthusiastically, joyfully, ready for the journey ahead. The promise of land kept, Andrea honored, and one final march to Rome together.\n\nWhat do you do next in Granada?"

Inspect the Grand Mosque to see if it's been converted to a church\n\nLet me handle these in order.\n\n**Boat Transportation:**\n- ~800 crusaders plus officials, guards, etc.\n- The fleet Juan ordered isn't ready yet (18-24 months from December order = won't be ready until late 1433 at earliest)\n- He mentioned possibly having the flagship ready by July for the Rome journey\n- But it's March now, Te Deum is April, Rome journey is May\n- So he'll need to arrange passage on existing ships - probably Genoese or other Mediterranean shipping\n- This is a logistical matter for Don García and officials\n\n**Grand Mosque:**\n- Granada's Great Mosque would be a major religious site\n- Historical practice: Conquering Christians typically converted mosques to churches immediately\n- But Juan has been more moderate on forced conversion\n- This will be interesting to explore - has it been converted yet? What's the status?\n- Don García would know\n\nLet me write this scene showing Juan arranging logistics and then visiting the mosque to see its status.\n\nPREPARATIONS AND THE GREAT MOSQUE\n\nArranging Transport to Rome\n\nYou summon Don García and your logistics officials to discuss the Rome journey. The question is straightforward: how do you transport eight hundred crusaders, the royal party, officials, and the sacred relics from Granada to Rome?\n\nDon García spreads maps across the table. \"Your Majesty, several options exist. The overland route through Aragón and along the Mediterranean coast is traditional but slow—perhaps three weeks of hard marching. For such a large group with the relics...\" He pauses. \"The sea route is faster and more fitting for the return of sacred objects.\"\n\n\"The Genoese fleet?\" you ask.\n\n\"Their contract has expired, Your Majesty, but they maintain commercial presence in Málaga. I can negotiate passage.\" He calculates. \"For eight hundred men plus the royal party, we'd need... eight to ten large transport ships. The Genoese can provide them, or we could contract with multiple shipping houses—some Venetian, some Catalan.\"\n\nOne of your officials adds: \"Your Majesty, the flagship being constructed in Cantabria—Master Gonzalo's latest report suggested it might be ready by July. Too late for the May departure to Rome.\"\n\nDon García nods. \"So we contract existing vessels. Málaga to Rome via Genoa or direct—roughly ten days with good winds, two weeks with poor. I recommend we arrange this immediately. The Genoese will charge premium for such a large transport, but...\" He smiles slightly. \"They also understand the symbolic value. Castile's crusaders returning the True Cross to Rome aboard ships blessed for the purpose.\"\n\n\"Make the arrangements,\" you instruct. \"Contract with the Genoese or whoever can provide reliable transport. I want those ships ready in Málaga by late April, immediately after the Te Deum.\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. I'll dispatch couriers to Málaga today.\"\n\nThe Great Mosque\n\nAfter the logistics meeting, you ask Don García a question that's been on your mind since arriving. \"The Great Mosque of Granada—what is its current status?\"\n\nDon García's expression becomes carefully neutral. \"Your Majesty should see it yourself. It's... a matter that requires your decision.\"\n\nHe leads you through Granada's streets. The city is adjusting to Christian rule—you see Castilian soldiers on patrol, Christian merchants beginning to arrive, but also Muslim residents going about their business with wary watchfulness. People recognize you and bow or kneel as you pass.\n\nThe Great Mosque of Granada rises before you—a magnificent structure in the heart of the city, its courtyard fountain still flowing, its minaret tower reaching skyward. As you approach, you see that the main entrance has been... modified. A large wooden cross has been erected above the door, but otherwise the building remains unmistakably a mosque.\n\nA Castilian priest—Father Miguel, Don García introduces him—waits at the entrance. He's young, perhaps thirty, and looks profoundly uncomfortable.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he bows deeply. \"I am honored by your visit.\"\n\n\"Father Miguel has been saying Mass inside for the Christian soldiers and officials,\" Don García explains. \"But the building itself has not been formally consecrated as a church. I... waited for Your Majesty's direction on this matter.\"\n\nFather Miguel adds hesitantly: \"Your Majesty, traditionally when a city is conquered, the mosque is immediately converted to a cathedral. But given...\" He glances at Don García, then continues. \"Given your approach to the Muslim population, I was uncertain whether immediate conversion was your intention, or whether you desired a different approach.\"\n\nYou enter through the great doors. Inside, the mosque is breathtaking—soaring arches, intricate geometric tile work, Arabic calligraphy covering the walls proclaiming \"There is no god but God.\" The qibla wall faces toward Mecca. The prayer hall is vast, capable of holding thousands.\n\nBut you also see signs of Christian use. A simple wooden altar has been set up in one corner. Candles burn before it. The space where Muslims would perform ritual washing has been cleaned but left intact.\n\nFather Miguel speaks quietly. \"Your Majesty, I have said Mass here for our soldiers. But the Muslim residents of Granada see this building. They know it was their Great Mosque. Some still come to the courtyard, though not inside.\" He pauses. \"What does Your Majesty wish done?\"\n\nDon García adds: \"There are perhaps fifty thousand Muslims in Granada city, Your Majesty. This was the center of their religious life. Whatever you decide will send a powerful message—to them, to the Christian population, to everyone watching how you govern conquered territory.\"\n\nThe question hangs in the magnificent space: What happens to Granada's Great Mosque?\n\nWhat do you do?"

          "text": "Juan is being pragmatic here. He needs a consecrated church for the Te Deum ceremony - a major religious ceremony celebrating the completion of the Reconquista with all the Iberian Christian monarchs attending. The Great Mosque is the largest and most significant religious building in Granada, the obvious choice for such an important ceremony.\n\nThis is Juan recognizing practical necessity while perhaps not fully considering the symbolic weight or alternatives. It's a realistic response - he's not being cruel or insensitive, just practical. The Te Deum needs a proper church, this is the building available.\n\nDon García and Father Miguel would likely acknowledge this practical reality while perhaps offering some nuance about how it's done, timing, etc. They might also mention that this follows historical precedent - conquered mosques were routinely converted to churches.\n\nThis is neither a \"good\" nor \"bad\" response in the moral sense - it's historically realistic for a medieval Christian king. The Reconquista traditionally involved converting mosques. Juan's been relatively moderate with the Muslim population, but he's also been clear that Christianity is now the law of the land.\n\nLet me have them respond realistically, acknowledging the necessity while perhaps discussing how to handle it.\n\nFather Miguel and Don García exchange glances. The priest speaks first.\n\n\"Your Majesty is correct. For the Te Deum—celebrating the completion of the Reconquista with all the Christian monarchs of Iberia present—we require a consecrated cathedral. And this...\" He gestures at the magnificent space around you. \"This is the only building in Granada suitable for such an assembly. The smaller churches cannot hold the gathering you're planning.\"\n\nDon García nods. \"The practical reality is clear, Your Majesty. We have perhaps two weeks before the ceremony. The building must be consecrated, prepared, made ready to receive kings and princes.\" He pauses. \"And frankly, this follows tradition. When Christian armies reconquer cities, mosques become churches. It has always been thus—Córdoba, Sevilla, every reconquered city.\"\n\nFather Miguel adds more gently: \"Your Majesty, if I may—the question is not whether to consecrate it, but how. A full conversion requires removing the Islamic elements: the calligraphy, the qibla orientation, the minaret. Some conquerors do this immediately and... forcefully. Others proceed more gradually.\" He looks at you. \"Given your approach with Commander Martín, with the fortress commanders, with the Muslim population... how does Your Majesty wish this done?\"\n\nDon García clarifies: \"For the Te Deum itself, we need the space blessed and an altar properly installed. The most obviously Islamic elements—perhaps the calligraphy directly around where the altar will stand—should probably be removed or covered. But the full architectural conversion—that could happen over time if Your Majesty wishes. Or it could happen now, completely, making a clean break.\"\n\nFather Miguel adds: \"Either way, Your Majesty, the Muslim population will know their Great Mosque has become a Christian cathedral. That message is unavoidable. The question is whether we do it with... consideration for their feelings, or whether we prioritize making the transformation complete and immediate.\"\n\nThey're both looking at you, waiting for direction on something that will indeed send a powerful message to Granada's fifty thousand Muslims.\n\nWhat do you decide about the conversion process?"

The priest needs to respond to this delegation of authority and likely outline what he thinks the balanced approach should be.\n\nThis is a significant moment - Juan is not micromanaging the conversion but trusting local judgment within his stated principles. Father Miguel will probably outline a moderate approach that consecrates for the Te Deum but doesn't unnecessarily antagonize the Muslim population.\n\nFather Miguel looks at you for a long moment, then nods slowly. Understanding crosses his face.\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. I believe I do.\" He walks toward the qibla wall, thinking aloud. \"For the Te Deum, we need a proper altar and the space blessed. The calligraphy immediately surrounding the altar area—that must be covered or removed, as it would be inappropriate to celebrate Mass beneath words denying Christ's divinity.\" He turns back to you. \"But the rest of the building, the courtyard, the architectural elements... these can remain for now.\"\n\nHe continues, his voice gaining confidence. \"We make it functionally a cathedral for Christian worship—consecrated, altar installed, cross prominently displayed. The Muslim population will understand that their Great Mosque now serves the Christian God. That message is clear and unavoidable.\" He pauses. \"But we don't strip every trace of Islamic art from the walls in a fury of iconoclasm. We don't desecrate what was holy to them unnecessarily. We... govern.\"\n\nDon García nods approvingly. \"A church that was once a mosque, rather than pretending it was never a mosque at all. Practical, honest, and less likely to provoke resentment that could destabilize the city.\"\n\nFather Miguel adds: \"Your Majesty, I will consult with the Archbishop of Toledo if possible, or proceed with local authority if time is short. The consecration will happen within the week. The building will be ready for the Te Deum. And it will be done...\" He searches for the word. \"...with the same approach Your Majesty has shown throughout Granada. Firm about Christian rule, but not cruel about it.\"\n\n\"The Muslim population will still mourn this loss,\" Don García observes quietly. \"Their Great Mosque becoming a cathedral is a profound blow, no matter how it's done. But doing it this way means they mourn rather than rage.\"\n\nFather Miguel bows. \"I understand my task, Your Majesty. The cathedral will be ready, and Granada will remain at peace.\"\n\nWhat do you do next?"

          "text": "1. King Alfonso V of Aragón is Juan II's nephew\n2. The Infantes (Juan de Aragón and Enrique de Aragón) rebelled against Juan II in 1430\n3. Both Infantes renounced ALL claims to Aragón's throne forever (sworn oaths before True Cross and Santiago's bone in Chapter 8.5)\n4. Both Infantes served honorably in Granada crusade and earned redemption\n5. Infante Juan de Aragón is King of Navarre (separate from Aragón)\n6. Relations with Aragón described as \"Reconciled, Neutral-Positive\"\n7. King Alfonso V invited to Te Deum with \"moderate probability\" of attendance\n\nNow I need to think about what factors would influence Alfonso V's decision to attend:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (reasons to attend):\n- Historical significance - completion of 710-year Reconquista\n- Family connection - Juan is his uncle\n- Political necessity - not attending would be conspicuous absence\n- The Infantes (his uncles/relatives) will likely attend, making his absence awkward\n- Diplomatic opportunity to strengthen Iberian Christian unity\n- Portugal definitely attending - Alfonso doesn't want to seem less invested\n- Juan's prestige at peak - conquered Granada, has papal backing\n- Showing Aragonese relevance in Iberian affairs\n- Te Deum is religious ceremony, not just political - harder to skip\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (reasons not to attend):\n- Aragón has own concerns - Sicily, Naples, Italian possessions\n- The Infantes' renunciation was humiliating for Aragonese royal family\n- Juan's growing power might threaten Aragonese interests\n- Long journey from Aragón to Granada\n- Possible resentment that Castile completed Reconquista without Aragonese help\n\n- Age dynamics could complicate his decision - potentially feeling overshadowed by his older uncle\n- Italian territorial interests might demand his immediate attention\n\nI assess the attendance probability as nuanced. Personal representation seems a strategic compromise, with a 50-70% chance of direct participation and a 20-40% likelihood of sending a diplomatic representative. The historical moment's significance slightly tips the scales toward personal attendance.\n\nThe world overview suggests genuine uncertainty, with attendance probabilities realistically centered in the 40-60% moderate range - indicating a delicate balance of competing priorities and strategic considerations.\n\nKEY FACTS:\n1. Alfonso V is Juan II's brother-in-law (married to Juan's sister María)\n2. Alfonso V is 34-43 years old (varies by chapter, now 1433 so probably around 44)\n3. He has no children after many years of marriage\n4. The Infantes (his brothers) rebelled against Juan II in 1430\n5. The Infantes renounced ALL claims to Aragón's throne for themselves AND ALL DESCENDANTS forever\n6. Alfonso's response to this was \"cold acceptance\" - not hostile but definitely wary\n7. He withdrew active support for the crusade and focused on Naples/Italy\n8. He maintains formal diplomatic relations through María\n9. Most recently (Chapter 33), Alfonso suffered a major military disaster in Naples - was captured by Genoese, his entire fleet lost\n10. The Aragonese succession situation: If Alfonso dies without heirs, Juan II has legitimate claim as next closest male relative with Aragonese Trastámara blood\n\nFACTORS FOR ATTENDANCE:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n- Historical significance - completion of 710-year Reconquista (huge)\n- Family connection - Juan is his brother-in-law\n- Political necessity - conspicuous absence would be noticed by all Iberia\n- The Infantes will likely attend, making Alfonso's absence more awkward\n- Portugal definitely attending (confirmed)\n- Juan's prestige at absolute peak - conquered Granada, papal backing\n- Te Deum is religious ceremony celebrating Christian victory - hard to skip\n- After Naples disaster, needs to show Aragonese strength/relevance\n- María (Juan's sister, Alfonso's wife) would likely encourage attendance\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n- The Infantes' renunciation was humiliating for Aragonese royal family\n- Relations described as \"cold acceptance\" - wary of Juan's power\n- Naples disaster means Alfonso dealing with crisis - was captured, fleet lost\n\n- Deep resentment over Castile completing Reconquista without Aragonese involvement\n- Growing political tensions threaten Aragonese royal interests\n- Extensive travel from Italy complicated by recent maritime catastrophe\n- Potential diplomatic compromise by sending María as representative\n- Increasing focus on Italian territories rather than Iberian politics\n- Uncertain succession adds complexity to potential attendance\n\nThe combination of personal, political, and logistical challenges makes Alfonso's participation highly unlikely, with diplomatic representation through María emerging as the most probable alternative.\n\nProbability assessment indicates a nuanced approach: María's representation seems most strategic, with personal attendance a secondary but plausible option, reflecting the delicate political landscape and ongoing challenges from the Naples crisis.\n\nLet me search for more specific information about Alfonso V's current situation and relationship with Juan II.\n\n- Lost 2,000-3,000 men in battle with René of Anjou\n- Lost significant territory after two years of securing it\n- Damaged reputation and spent enormous Aragonese wealth on Italian campaigns\n- Aragonese nobles openly questioning his leadership\n- Some nobles looking toward successful Juan II as alternative\n- Alfonso is 43-44, childless, obsessed with Naples\n- Relations with Juan described as \"cold acceptance\" - wary but not hostile\n\nFor the Te Deum attendance in April 1433 (now), Alfonso has had about 13 months since the Naples disaster to deal with aftermath. The Chapter 41 summary mentions \"40% chance\" of Alfonso attending.\n\nGiven all this context, I should create a realistic distribution where:\n- His attendance is genuinely uncertain (not guaranteed either way)\n- The Naples situation makes it LESS likely but not impossible\n- Sending María (Juan's sister, his wife) is most likely compromise\n- Personal attendance shows either duty/respect OR strategic calculation\n- Complete snub would be insulting but possible if Naples demands it\n\nDistribution should reflect:\n- Most likely: Sends representative/María (central outcome)\n- Moderate probabilities: Either attends personally despite complications OR doesn't send anyone\n- Lower probabilities: Enthusiastic attendance OR deliberately insulting absence\n\nBased on the project knowledge, I'll create a realistic distribution table for King Alfonso V of Aragón's attendance.\n\nCONTEXT: ALFONSO V'S SITUATION\n\nBackground:\n\nAlfonso V (age ~44) is Juan's brother-in-law (married to Juan's sister María)\n\nChildless after many years of marriage\n\nHis brothers (the Infantes) renounced all claims to Aragón's throne after rebelling against Juan\n\nRelations with Juan: \"cold acceptance\" - maintains formal diplomacy but wary\n\nFebruary 1432: Suffered major military disaster in Naples - lost 2,000-3,000 men, significant territory, damaged reputation fighting René of Anjou\n\nObsessed with Naples succession war, has poured Aragonese wealth into Italian campaigns for over a decade\n\nAragonese nobles openly questioning his leadership and Italian focus while ignoring Iberia\n\nSome nobles looking toward successful Juan II with interest\n\nCurrent Timing: March 1433 - about 13 months after Naples disaster\n\nD100 TABLE: WILL ALFONSO V ATTEND THE TE DEUM?\n\n1-8: Deliberate snub - Alfonso sends NO representative, not even formal apology. Naples complications used as excuse but clearly intentional slight. Resentment over Juan's success and Infantes' renunciation boils over. Insult to entire Iberian gathering. María (Juan's sister) caught in middle, sends private apology to brother.\n\n9-22: Naples crisis prevents attendance - Alfonso sends formal letter explaining Naples situation genuinely demands his presence (René advancing, critical negotiations, cannot leave). Sends senior Aragonese noble as representative with appropriate gifts but notably not María. Polite but Alfonso's absence conspicuous given significance of event.\n\n23-40: Sends María as sole representative - Juan's sister attends representing both herself and husband. Carries formal letter from Alfonso congratulating Juan, citing Naples obligations. María warm toward brother but uncomfortable position. Adequate diplomatic courtesy but Alfonso's absence noted by all present. Mixed message about Aragonese-Castilian relations.\n\n41-55: Sends María plus Aragonese delegation - Alfonso remains in Naples but sends impressive delegation: María, Archbishop of Zaragoza, 2-3 senior nobles, formal gifts. Clear effort to show respect despite absence. María authorized to discuss matters of mutual interest. Honorable compromise given circumstances—Alfonso acknowledges significance while managing Naples.\n\n56-68: Alfonso attends but briefly/tensely - Comes personally out of duty but stays minimum time required. Formal, correct, but cool. Congratulates Juan appropriately but clearly uncomfortable with Juan's triumph highlighting his own Italian failures. Leaves quickly citing Naples obligations. Fulfills obligation without warmth.\n\n69-80: Alfonso attends with appropriate dignity - Comes personally with María and modest Aragonese delegation. Participates fully in Te Deum, congratulates Juan sincerely on completing Reconquista. Some awkwardness given past tensions but behaves as brother-in-law should. Naples troubles evident but doesn't dominate. Proper diplomatic attendance.\n\n81-92: Surprisingly warm attendance - Alfonso attends and makes genuine effort at reconciliation. Naples disasters have humbled him, Juan's success impressed him. Brings thoughtful gifts, participates enthusiastically. Private conversation with Juan about family matters and Iberian cooperation. María relieved at improved relations. Suggests Alfonso reassessing priorities after Italian failures.\n\n93-100: Alfonso proposes alliance - Not only attends warmly but seeks private meeting to discuss Iberian cooperation. Naples disasters made him reconsider obsession with Italy. Impressed by Juan's achievements, suggests coordinating future efforts. Hints at supporting Juan's broader crusading vision if it includes Aragonese interests. Potential turning point in their relationship. María delighted at reconciliation.\n\nDistribution reflects:\n\nMost likely (23-68, 46%): Some level of diplomatic representation, either through María or Alfonso himself with varying degrees of enthusiasm\n\nModerate (9-22 & 69-80, 26%): Either absence with good excuse OR proper personal attendance\n\nLower probability (81-100, 20%): Increasingly positive personal attendance suggesting relationship improvement\n\nUnlikely (1-8, 8%): Deliberate insult through complete absence\n\nThe Naples disaster and \"cold acceptance\" relationship make warm attendance unlikely but possible. Most probable outcome is adequate diplomatic courtesy through delegation or brief personal appearance.\n\nPlease roll your physical d100."

The symbolism is enormous.\n\nI should craft:\n1. The arrivals of each monarch/party over the coming weeks\n2. The preparations for the Te Deum ceremony\n3. Alfonso's surprising warmth and alliance proposal\n4. The dynamics between all these rulers\n5. The symbolic weight of them all gathering in the Alhambra\n\nThis is early April 1433. Juan arrived late March. The Te Deum is scheduled for early April (around April 1433 to commemorate the completion of the Reconquista).\n\nTHE GATHERING OF KINGS\n\nLate March - Early April, 1433\n\nGranada transforms over the coming weeks into something Iberia has not seen in living memory—a gathering place for all the Christian monarchs of the peninsula. The Alhambra, which three months ago housed a Muslim Sultan, now prepares to receive Portuguese princes, Aragonese royalty, and the redeemed Infantes who once rebelled against your rule.\n\nDon García coordinates the logistics with impressive efficiency. The Alhambra's many palaces and chambers are assigned: the finest quarters for visiting royalty, lesser but still dignified accommodations for their retinues. The city below prepares as well—banners hung from every building, streets cleaned, the newly consecrated cathedral (formerly the Great Mosque) prepared for the grand Te Deum.\n\nThe Portuguese Arrival - March 30, 1433\n\nKing João I of Portugal arrives first, and his entrance is magnificent. At seventy-three, he is still vigorous, riding at the head of a column that includes his eldest son Prince Duarte (heir to Portugal) and his younger son Prince Henrique—Henry the Navigator, already famous for his interest in exploration and African ventures.\n\nYou meet them at Granada's gates with full ceremony. João dismounts stiffly but with dignity, and when he embraces you, there's genuine warmth.\n\n\"Juan, my son-in-law.\" His voice is strong despite his age. \"When Isabel wrote telling me you'd conquered Granada, I wept. Seventy-three years old, and I wept like a boy.\" He pulls back to look at you. \"My daughter chose well. Or rather, I chose well for her, and God blessed the choice.\"\n\nPrince Duarte, a serious man in his early forties, bows respectfully. \"Your Majesty, Portugal rejoices in Castile's triumph. The Reconquista's completion is victory for all Christendom.\"\n\nBut it's Prince Henrique who surprises you. Younger, perhaps thirty-eight, with an intense, thoughtful gaze. \"Your Majesty,\" he says, \"I've heard of your plans for Mediterranean commerce, your fleet construction. I would very much like to discuss these matters while we're here. Portugal's experience with African coasts and Atlantic navigation might prove... complementary to your own endeavors.\"\n\nThat evening, at a private dinner in the Alhambra, João raises the Gibraltar Strait question you'd hoped to discuss. \"Juan, my scouts report you control Gibraltar now. And I, as you know, hold Ceuta.\" He smiles knowingly. \"Two kingdoms, two sides of the strait. Shall we compete, or shall we cooperate?\"\n\nThe conversation that follows is productive. João is intrigued by your joint patrol proposal, the shared intelligence, the coordinated approach to Moroccan relations. \"Better to work together than waste energy in rivalry,\" he concludes. \"Portugal and Castile united could control all traffic between Mediterranean and Atlantic. That's power, Juan. Real power.\"\n\nThe Navarrese Arrival - April 1, 1433\n\nInfante Juan de Aragón—now properly styled as Juan II, King of Navarre—arrives next, and his entrance is more complicated emotionally. The man who once rebelled against you, who seized Arévalo while you journeyed to Rome, now rides into the city you conquered as your honored guest.\n\nHe brings his nine-year-old son Carlos, Prince of Viana—the boy whose inheritance rights you swore to protect in exchange for his father's renunciation of all claims to Aragón's throne.\n\nWhen Juan of Navarre kneels before you in formal greeting, you raise him up immediately and embrace him. \"Brother crusader,\" you say simply. \"Welcome to Granada.\"\n\nHis eyes glisten. \"Your Majesty, I... when I took the oath before the True Cross, I didn't fully comprehend what I was becoming. But these two years serving in your army, fighting for something greater than ambition...\" He pauses. \"You gave me redemption when you could have given me death. That is not forgotten.\"\n\nYoung Carlos watches this exchange with wide eyes. The boy is well-mannered, intelligent-looking. When you speak to him, asking about his studies and his kingdom of Navarre, he answers thoughtfully.\n\nThat evening, Juan of Navarre makes a request. \"Your Majesty, when the Te Deum is celebrated, might I be permitted to carry one of the sacred relics in the procession? The True Cross or Santiago's bone?\" His voice is humble. \"I served the crusade for two years. I would count it the greatest honor of my life.\"\n\nThe Second Infante - April 2, 1433\n\nInfante Enrique de Aragón arrives the following day, alone and simply dressed. Unlike his brother Juan who retained a kingdom, Enrique renounced everything and has lived these past years as essentially a landless noble who earned redemption through crusade service.\n\nWhen he sees you, he doesn't kneel formally—he drops to both knees and bows his head. \"Your Majesty. My king. My commander.\"\n\nYou raise him up, and he embraces you fiercely. \"I was a fool,\" he says quietly, for your ears only. \"An ambitious fool who nearly destroyed everything for pride. You showed me what true kingship looks like. What faith looks like.\" He pulls back. \"The lands in Granada you promised—I don't need them, Your Majesty. If you have use for me, I'll serve. That's enough.\"\n\nThe Aragonese Arrival - April 4, 1433\n\nWhen word comes that King Alfonso V of Aragón approaches, you're uncertain what to expect. The man who withdrew support after his brothers' renunciation, who has been fighting a losing war in Naples for over a decade, who sent only \"cold acceptance\" of your conquest of Granada—what brings him here personally?\n\nThe answer becomes clear as his column rides through the gates. Alfonso has brought María, your sister, of course. But he's also brought Archbishop Dalmau of Zaragoza, two senior Aragonese nobles, and gifts: a reliquary of Saint George (Aragón's patron) for Granada's new cathedral, and an illuminated manuscript of the Chronicles of the Kings of Aragón.\n\nAlfonso himself looks older than his forty-four years. The Naples campaigns have weathered him. But when he dismounts and approaches, there's something different in his bearing—less pride, perhaps. More... thoughtfulness.\n\n\"Juan.\" He uses your name, not your title. \"My wife's brother. My brothers' redeemer.\" He embraces you formally, then steps back. \"I came personally because anything less would be insulting to what you've achieved. The Reconquista is complete. Seven hundred ten years of war, ended by my brother-in-law at age twenty.\"\n\nMaría, your sister, embraces you next with tears. \"Little brother,\" she whispers. \"Look at you. Look at what you've done.\"\n\nThat evening, Alfonso requests private audience. When you meet in one of the Alhambra's smaller chambers—just the two of you, no attendants—he's direct.\n\n\"Juan, I've spent twelve years pouring Aragonese blood and treasure into Italy. Chasing Naples like it's some great destiny.\" He walks to the window, looking out over Granada. \"And you know what I've achieved? Debt. Dead nobles. A reputation for losing battles. Meanwhile, you finish the Reconquista.\"\n\nHe turns to face you. \"I didn't come here just for the ceremony. I came because I need to reassess everything. My priorities. Aragón's priorities.\" He pauses. \"You're planning something bigger than Granada, aren't you? The Mediterranean commerce, the fleet you're building, the talk of Constantinople...\"\n\nWhen you confirm this carefully, he nods. \"I want Aragón to be part of it. Not as a rival. As an ally.\" He's earnest now. \"I know our relationship has been... complicated. The Infantes' renunciation created tensions. But Juan, if you're building something that extends beyond Castile—a crusading alliance, a Mediterranean power—Aragón should be your partner in that, not your competitor.\"\n\nHe continues: \"I have a fleet. I have Mediterranean ports. I have experience—hard-won, expensive experience—in Italian politics and warfare. You have papal backing, military success, the resources of completed crusade. Together...\" He spreads his hands. \"Together we could actually accomplish what individual kingdoms cannot.\"\n\n\"What about Naples?\" you ask.\n\nHe grimaces. \"Naples is a trap I've been too proud to abandon. But after the disaster last year...\" He shakes his head. \"Perhaps it's time to cut losses. Or at least to not let Italian ambitions blind me to Iberian opportunities.\" He meets your eyes. \"I'm here to propose genuine alliance, Juan. Not just treaty words, but actual cooperation. Your crusading vision, my Mediterranean resources. Family alliance backed by strategic partnership.\"\n\nThis is unexpected. Alfonso, humbled by Naples failures and impressed by your success, offering real cooperation.\n\nWhat do you say to him?"

Your words seem to catch him completely off guard—he clearly expected political negotiation, strategic discussion, perhaps even skepticism about his sincerity. Instead, you spoke of God's kingdom and his soul.\n\nHe turns away, and you see his shoulders tighten. When he speaks, his voice is rougher. \"I've been chasing glory for twelve years, Juan. My glory. Aragón's glory. The throne of Naples like it would prove something.\" He's quiet for a moment. \"And I've watched men die for my pride. Good men. Aragonese knights bleeding out in Italian mud for... what? So I could call myself Rex Utriusque Siciliae?\"\n\nHe turns back to face you, and there are tears in his eyes. \"Last year, when René's forces ambushed us near Ponza, I was almost captured. Almost. One of my guards—a boy, barely twenty—threw himself in front of me. Took a spear meant for my chest.\" His voice breaks slightly. \"He died so I could escape. And as we retreated, as I watched my army fall apart, I kept thinking: For what? What have I been doing?\"\n\nHe wipes his eyes roughly. \"Your sister María has been telling me for years that I'm chasing shadows. That real kingship isn't about conquest for its own sake, but about serving something greater.\" He meets your eyes. \"I didn't want to listen. But then I heard about Granada. About how you turned enemies into allies. How you kept your word to my brothers even when it cost you politically. How you actually finished what you set out to do, not for your own glory, but because you believed God willed it.\"\n\nHe's silent for a moment, then continues. \"So yes. Whatever cooperation you're willing to offer, I want to be part of it. Not because I see strategic advantage—though I do—but because...\" He struggles with the words. \"Because I want to serve something that actually matters. And I think, God help me, you might be building that.\"\n\nThe Aragonese king stands before you, humbled and sincere, waiting to hear what you will say.\n\nWhat do you do?"

In 1420, Queen Joanna II of Naples—she was old even then, childless, had no direct heirs—formally adopted me as her son and heir. A legal adoption, witnessed, sealed, recognized by the Pope at the time.\" He leans back. \"Naples and Sicily had been ruled by Aragonese kings before. My family has legitimate historical connection to the kingdom. It wasn't some fabricated pretension.\"\n\nHe pauses, collecting his thoughts. \"I was young—twenty-six. The King of Aragón being adopted by the Queen of Naples as heir to one of the richest kingdoms in Italy? It seemed like destiny. Like God was handing me the opportunity to make Aragón a true Mediterranean power. I started calling myself 'Rex Utriusque Siciliae'—King of Both Sicilies. I believed it.\"\n\nHis expression darkens. \"But Joanna... Joanna is fickle. A political survivor who's played different factions against each other for decades. Five years after adopting me, she revoked it. Just... changed her mind. Designated Louis III of Anjou as her heir instead. When Louis died, she picked his brother René.\"\n\n\"And you stayed anyway?\" you observe.\n\n\"I stayed because...\" He struggles with this. \"Because I'd already invested so much. Men, gold, political capital. Aragonese nobles had followed me to Italy on the promise of Neapolitan wealth and position. How could I just... abandon that? Tell them we were leaving empty-handed?\"\n\nHe stands and walks to the window. \"So I kept fighting. Every year, I told myself: one more campaign and we'll secure it. One more victory and Joanna will see René can't hold Naples against me. One more push and the Neapolitan nobles will declare for me instead of the French.\"\n\n\"But it never came,\" you say quietly.\n\n\"It never came.\" He turns back to you. \"Because I wasn't fighting for a throne anymore. I was fighting to prove I hadn't wasted twelve years. Fighting so I wouldn't have to admit I'd been wrong. It became about my pride, my reputation, not about Aragón's interests.\"\n\nHe sits again heavily. \"Last year's disaster—the Battle of Ponza, they're calling it—René outmaneuvered me completely. We lost two thousand men in a single afternoon. I lost artillery, ships, territory we'd held for years. The cost to ransom captured nobles will bankrupt Aragonese families.\"\n\n\"And now?\" you ask.\n\n\"Now I'm forty-four years old. I've spent a generation's worth of Aragonese wealth achieving nothing. My wife—your sister—has been patient, but she's watched me obsess over Naples while ignoring Aragón, ignoring Iberia, ignoring her.\" His voice is raw. \"And meanwhile, my brothers renounced everything to join your crusade and found redemption. And you, at twenty years old, actually finished the Reconquista.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"The contrast is... humbling. That's why I came here personally, Juan. Not just for ceremony. Because I needed to see what actual achievement looks like. What it looks like when a king serves God's purpose instead of his own pride.\"\n\nHe's silent for a moment, then adds: \"Naples will resolve itself eventually. Joanna will die—she's ancient. René and I will probably keep fighting over the corpse of the kingdom for years. But I can't let that be all I am anymore. If there's a chance to be part of something that actually matters—your crusading vision, this eternal crusade you're building—I want that.\"\n\nThe room is quiet. Outside, you can hear the sounds of Granada preparing for tomorrow's great ceremony. Alfonso waits to hear what you'll say to this raw confession."

He also said she's \"ancient\" now.\n\nLet me be historically accurate but also recognize this is an alternate timeline. I should have Alfonso provide the information naturally in dialogue.\n\nAlfonso considers. \"She must be... sixty now? Born in 1373, so yes, sixty years old. Ancient for a woman, especially one who's lived as turbulently as she has.\"\n\nHe leans forward. \"As for health—that's the question everyone in Naples asks constantly. She's ruled since 1414, nineteen years now. Every year for the past five years, there have been rumors she's dying. Deathbed scenes, last rites administered, nobles positioning themselves for the succession. And then she recovers.\"\n\n\"But?\" you prompt.\n\n\"But she is old. And each illness takes more out of her. Two years ago she was bedridden for months. Last year, she couldn't leave her chambers for weeks at a time.\" He spreads his hands. \"The betting in Naples—and yes, people actually bet on this—is that she has perhaps two years left. Maybe three if she's extraordinarily hardy. But no one thinks she'll see sixty-five.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"Which means René and I are both essentially waiting for her death to settle the question. The Neapolitan nobles are split—some support the French Angevins, some support me, most are waiting to see who looks stronger when Joanna finally dies.\" His voice turns bitter. \"So I pour more resources into maintaining position, he does the same, and we bleed each other while an old woman clings to life and plays us against each other.\"\n\n\"And when she dies?\"\n\n\"Open warfare. Full-scale battle for the succession. Unless...\" He looks at you directly. \"Unless one of us decides the prize isn't worth more blood.

          "text": "Juan is asking practical military questions about the Naples situation. This is good - he's thinking strategically about Alfonso's situation. I should have Alfonso explain the military situation clearly.\n\nKey points to cover:\n1. Current territorial control - who holds what\n2. The Angevin situation - they're not coming FROM France, they have bases in Italy/Southern France\n3. Military logistics and how René can compete despite Alfonso controlling Sicily\n4. The complexity of Italian politics and alliances\n\nAlfonso would appreciate these soldier-to-soldier questions and be able to explain clearly.\n\nAlfonso's expression shifts—you've asked a question he can answer as one military commander to another, not as a humbled king confessing failures. He straightens slightly.\n\n\"Militarily, it's complicated. Naples itself—the city and immediate surroundings—I've never been able to take and hold. Too fortified, too much local support for various factions. René doesn't fully control it either. The city essentially governs itself, waiting to see who wins.\"\n\nHe traces patterns on the arm of his chair, visualizing the map. \"I hold Sicily—that's my base of power, been in Aragonese hands for generations. Strong position. From there, I control the southern approaches to Naples, several coastal fortresses in Calabria, and I have alliances with nobles in the Neapolitan countryside.\"\n\n\"And René?\"\n\n\"René holds the city of Naples more or less, though it's contested. He controls much of the northern approaches from Rome. And here's where it gets complicated—the Angevins aren't coming from France directly. The House of Anjou has held territories in southern France and Italy for generations. René is Duke of Anjou in France, yes, but he's also Duke of Lorraine, Count of Provence. His bases are Provence and parts of northern Italy, not distant France.\"\n\nAlfonso continues: \"More importantly, he has backing from the French crown and from Pope Eugenius IV, who prefers French influence in Naples to Aragonese. The Pope controls the Papal States directly north of Naples—so René has sanctuary, supply lines, and diplomatic support running straight from Rome to Naples.\"\n\n\"So you're fighting on two fronts,\" you observe. \"René from the north with papal backing, and you from Sicily in the south.\"\n\n\"Exactly. And the Neapolitan nobles play us against each other. They pledge to whichever side seems stronger at the moment, then switch when the wind changes. Every fortress, every town, every alliance is temporary.\" He grimaces. \"That's why twelve years of campaigning has achieved so little. There's no decisive battle that settles it. Just endless maneuvering, bribes, betrayals, small sieges, raids. We bleed each other slowly.\"\n\n\"The Battle of Ponza last year—that was different?\"\n\n\"That was me trying to force a decision. I gathered a fleet, attempted a major offensive to cut René's supply lines. He anticipated it, positioned his forces cleverly, and caught us in bad waters near the island of Ponza.\" Alfonso's voice is bitter. \"Naval disaster. Lost galleys, lost men, lost momentum. It wasn't a land battle—it was a naval engagement where I got outmaneuvered completely.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"From a pure military standpoint, neither side can win decisively without either massive reinforcement or the other side giving up. René can't take Sicily—it's too strongly held and too far from his bases. I can't take Naples proper—too fortified and too close to his support from Rome. So we exhaust ourselves in the middle ground.\"\n\n\"Unless Joanna dies and the Neapolitan nobles choose a side decisively,\" you note.\n\n\"That's the theory. When she dies, the Neapolitans will have to commit. They'll face the reality that one of us will rule them—no more playing both sides. The question is which way they'll break.\" He pauses. \"Last year's disaster hurt my position badly. Showed me as beatable. If Joanna died today, I'm not certain the nobles would choose me over René.\"\n\nHe's quiet for a moment, then adds: \"That's part of why I'm here, Juan. Not just spiritual crisis, though that's real. But also strategic reassessment. If I keep pouring everything into Naples and still lose when Joanna dies, Aragón will have nothing. But if I redirect some focus to Iberian cooperation, to your crusading vision—even if Naples falls through, Aragón gains something real.\""

I have neither after twenty years of marriage. Forgive me if I find it difficult to sympathize with your 'succession concerns.'\" Realizes too late he's being harsh but damage done. Moment of bonding breaks into awkward tension.\n\n7-18: Guarded response - Alfonso is careful. \"Succession is always uncertain, Juan. We do what we can and trust God.\" Doesn't open up further. You sense he's wondering if you're positioning somehow, making comparison between your situation and his. Polite but creates distance rather than closeness.\n\n19-35: Practical but reserved - \"Your physicians say second birth is safer? Then trust their expertise. Isabel is young and strong.\" Offers standard kingly advice but doesn't match your vulnerability with his own. Keeps conversation from becoming too personal. You've shared but he hasn't reciprocated at same depth.\n\n36-55: Genuine empathy, some opening up - Alfonso softens. \"I know that fear, Juan. Every king does. The weight of dynasty, of nobles demanding heirs...\" He pauses. \"María and I have prayed for children for years. Nothing. So yes, I understand the pressure.\" Sympathetic but doesn't fully engage with deeper implications. Bonds somewhat but carefully.\n\n56-70: Warm, honest response - \"Brother, I will pray for Isabel's safe delivery and healthy son.\" Uses \"brother\" naturally. \"Succession weighs on every king. You at least have time—you're twenty. I'm forty-four and childless.\" Self-deprecating without bitterness. \"But we serve God's purposes, not our own plans. Sometimes He has different paths than we expect.\" Opens up genuinely.\n\n71-85: Deep personal sharing - Alfonso's eyes glisten. \"You trust me with this? After everything?\" He's moved. \"Juan, I've watched my wife suffer through years of trying. Every month, hope and disappointment. The nobles' whispers about my lack of heir.\" His voice cracks slightly. \"So yes, I know that fear intimately. I'll pray every day for Isabel. For you. For the child.\" Real emotional connection.\n\n86-94: Profound moment of connection - Alfonso grips your arm. \"Thank you for trusting me with this worry. After I've wasted years in Italy, after the complications with my brothers...\" He pauses. \"You could have kept distance. Instead you share this with me as family.\" His voice is thick. \"Whatever happens with Isabel's pregnancy, know that Aragón will support you. And whatever happens with my succession...\" He doesn't finish but implication clear - he's not threatened by Juan's position.\n\n95-100: Complete breakthrough - Alfonso embraces you suddenly. \"God help me, Juan, but I'm glad it's you.\" When he pulls back there are tears. \"If I die without heirs - and let's be honest, that's likely - the Infantes eliminated, distant cousins with weak claims...\" He meets your eyes. \"You should rule Aragón. You actually know how to be a king. And you just proved you care about succession as burden, not prize.\" Explicitly endorses your eventual claim. \"Let's both pray Isabel gives you son. And if she doesn't, let's pray God gives you wisdom to navigate that too.\"\n\nDistribution reflects:\n\nMost likely (36-70, 35%): Genuine sympathy with varying degrees of personal opening\n\nModerate positive (71-94, 24%): Increasingly deep personal connection and trust\n\nSome reservation (19-35, 17%): Practical but careful, doesn't fully reciprocate vulnerability\n\nGuarded (7-18, 12%): Wary response wondering about positioning\n\nUpper breakthrough (95-100, 6%): Complete endorsement of Juan's eventual succession claim\n\nDefensive (1-6, 6%): Painful comparison triggers defensiveness\n\nAlfonso's humble current state makes positive outcomes most probable, but succession topic inherently sensitive.\n\nPlease roll your physical d100."

Let me look at what that means:\n\n\"Guarded response - Alfonso is careful. \"Succession is always uncertain, Juan. We do what we can and trust God.\" Doesn't open up further. You sense he's wondering if you're positioning somehow, making comparison between your situation and his. Polite but creates distance rather than closeness.\"\n\nSo Alfonso should:\n- Give a careful, guarded response\n- Not match Juan's vulnerability\n- Be polite but not deeply personal\n- Seem like he's wondering if Juan is positioning\n- Create some distance rather than closeness\n\nI need to write Alfonso's response WITHOUT writing any dialogue or actions for Juan. I should stop when it's Juan's turn to speak or act.\n\nAlfonso's expression shifts slightly—not hostile, but... careful. Guarded. The emotional openness from moments ago seems to close off a bit.\n\n\"Succession is always uncertain, Juan.\" His tone is measured, almost formal compared to the raw confession he just shared about Naples. \"We do what we can and trust God to provide. Your physicians say the second birth should be safer than the first? Then trust their expertise. Isabel is young and healthy. You have every reason for hope.\"\n\nIt's good advice, kingly advice even, but there's something missing—the reciprocal vulnerability you offered him. He's answering your question but not really engaging with the deeper worry beneath it.\n\nHe stands and walks back to the window, putting some physical distance between you. When he speaks again, his back is partly to you. \"The nobles always demand heirs. It's their nature to worry about succession, about stability. But you're twenty years old with a daughter and a wife expecting. You have time to secure your line.\"\n\nThere's a pause, and you sense something unspoken in the silence. He's thinking something he's not saying. When he turns back, his expression is polite but more closed than it was minutes ago.\n\n\"I'll certainly pray for Isabel's safe delivery and for a healthy child.\" The words are sincere enough, but there's a formality to them now. \"Is there... anything else you wished to discuss before tomorrow's ceremony?\"\n\nThe warmth from his earlier confession about Naples hasn't disappeared entirely, but it's definitely cooled. You get the distinct impression that something about your question made him cautious—whether he's wondering if you were making a comparison between your situations, or if you were fishing for information about his own lack of heirs, or something else entirely, you're not certain. But the moment of deep connection has become more carefully diplomatic.\n\nWhat do you do?"

A d100 roll of 60 produces genuine consideration from Alfonso, who asks strategic questions about papal mechanics, naval command structure, trade rights, and how to ensure genuine partnership rather than Castilian domination. Juan shows him the crusade treasury being returned to Rome as proof of integrity. Alfonso agrees to send ambassador Don Bernat de Centelles with Juan to Rome to explore papal support for the Naples claim.",

What I am about to say certainly is. Forgive me if it may seem outlandish to you, I mean no disrespect, but I see an opportunity to bring God's kingdom closer to earth.\n\n\nYou mentioned that papal support is important for the Anjou. I luckily have a certain weight in Rome and the vatican. More than that, I have an army that has just completed and won a great victory. We are already family. I have publicly announced at the council of Basel my commitment to help Christians against the Ottomans. Castille alone would only be able to do so in a limited fashion. I barely have any ships at all and to fight the Ottomans overland would mean hiring an entire fleet of travelling with the army through the pyrenees, France, Italy, the Balkans. And I would be facing enormous Muslim armies. But a strong alliance with Aragon that also holds the crown of Naples...that changes everything. This would give me real naval access and the power to truly compete with the Ottomans.\n\n\nAnd I fall silent before continuing, taking a deep breath.\n\n\nAnd also...as long as I don't have a son, my succession is not secure. This creates tention. If I would nominate you as my heir, this matter is solved. I trust in God to keep me safe, but I do take risks in battle and when I approach enemy gates, i know that. But with you as my heir, all my work will not be undone should I fall. You are family and a proven and experienced king. I think my nobles would gladly accept you.\n\n\nI look at him hesitantly.\n\n\nWhat do you think? Would you be open to such an alliance? I have not discussed this with anyone, but it somehow all seems to fit together. The pope can support your claim so that I can better fight the ottomans...I have learned to speak my mind when I catch a glimpse of the kingdom of heaven.\n\n\nDraft a d100 table to see how the king responds."

          "text": "1. Juan offering to use his papal influence and military resources to help Alfonso secure Naples\n2. In exchange for strong alliance to fight Ottomans\n3. AND Juan naming Alfonso as his heir to Castile if he dies without sons\n\nThis is incredibly bold. Let me analyze the factors:\n\n**SUCCESS FACTORS:**\n- Offers Alfonso something concrete: help securing Naples using papal influence and military power\n- Addresses Alfonso's current weakness (papal support for René)\n- Creates strategic alliance Alfonso just said he wanted\n- Names Alfonso as heir, solving Juan's stated succession concern\n- Makes it mutual benefit, not one-sided\n- Frames as \"glimpse of kingdom of heaven\" - spiritual framing\n- They're already family\n- Alfonso just expressed desire to be part of Juan's crusading vision\n- Gives Alfonso path back to relevance and success\n- Constantinople campaign becomes viable with combined resources\n\n**FAILURE FACTORS:**\n- This is CRAZY ambitious - uniting Castile, Aragon, and Naples\n- Alfonso might see it as Juan trying to control him\n- Could seem like Juan positioning to eventually absorb Aragon\n- Alfonso has no heirs - if Juan names him heir, then when Alfonso dies, Juan or his heir gets everything back anyway\n- Might seem like manipulation after Alfonso just opened up\n- Very convenient for Juan - gets Naples involvement, Ottoman campaign capability, AND succession security\n- Could trigger Alfonso's suspicion about Juan's Aragonese succession claim\n- The timing right after succession discussion might seem calculated\n\nAlfonso is in humble mood but also just got guarded when Juan mentioned succession. This proposal directly addresses that tension but could go either way.\n\nI need to create realistic distribution. Alfonso is:\n1. Humbled by Naples failures\n2. Impressed by Juan's success  \n3. Just said he wants to be part of something bigger\n4. BUT also just got guarded about succession talk\n5. Childless and aware Juan is next in line for Aragon\n\nThis is such a bold proposal that moderate outcomes are less likely - it will either resonate strongly or trigger major concerns.\n\nI need to create a d100 table for Alfonso's response to this extraordinary proposal.\n\nSUCCESS/FAILURE FACTORS ANALYSIS\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nOffers Alfonso concrete help securing Naples (papal influence + military resources)\n\nAddresses Alfonso's stated desire for meaningful alliance\n\nCreates viable path to Ottoman campaign Alfonso could be part of\n\nMakes it mutual benefit - Juan gets succession security, Alfonso gets Naples support\n\nStrategic logic is sound - combined Castile-Aragon-Naples could actually challenge Ottomans\n\nAlfonso just expressed wanting to be part of \"something that matters\"\n\nThey're family, Alfonso already proposed alliance minutes ago\n\nSolves Alfonso's Naples problem which has consumed him for 12 years\n\nFrames as spiritual vision, not pure political calculation\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nComes RIGHT AFTER Alfonso got guarded about succession discussion\n\nExtremely convenient for Juan - gets everything he needs\n\nAlfonso has no heirs - so naming him Juan's heir means everything eventually comes to Juan's line anyway\n\nCould seem like calculated manipulation after Alfonso opened up emotionally\n\nUniting three kingdoms is wildly ambitious - might seem unrealistic\n\nAlfonso might see it as Juan trying to control/absorb Aragon through back door\n\nTiming makes it look like Juan was positioning all along with succession question\n\nAlfonso aware Juan is already next in Aragonese succession line\n\nCould trigger all Alfonso's fears about Juan's ambitions re: Aragon\n\nVery bold after just meeting - might need more trust-building first\n\nD100 TABLE: ALFONSO'S RESPONSE TO ALLIANCE PROPOSAL\n\n1-8: Sees manipulation - Alfonso's face closes completely. \"So the succession question was positioning after all.\" His voice is cold. \"You offer to make me your heir when you know I'm childless - meaning everything comes to your line eventually anyway. And I give you Naples, naval power, and legitimize your designs on Aragon in exchange?\" Stands abruptly. \"I thought we were having honest conversation. Instead you're playing games far above my capability.\" Leaves. Alliance proposal dead, relationship damaged.\n\n9-22: Deep suspicion activated - \"Juan...\" Alfonso's tone is careful, almost sad. \"This is extraordinary offer. Perhaps too extraordinary. You'd name me heir, help me take Naples, unite three kingdoms...\" He shakes his head slowly. \"But I have no children. You know that. So you're essentially offering me temporary custody of your succession before it returns to your line, while I give you control of Aragonese-Neapolitan naval power?\" Pauses. \"I need time to think. This is... a lot. And the timing, right after discussing succession...\" Doesn't reject outright but deeply wary.\n\n23-40: Overwhelmed, needs time - Alfonso sits heavily. \"You're proposing to unite Castile, Aragon, and Naples. To commit my resources to your Ottoman campaign. To make me your heir.\" He rubs his face. \"Juan, this is... I came here for Te Deum. Now you're talking about reshaping the entire Mediterranean.\" Not hostile but clearly struggling. \"I cannot give answer to something this significant tonight. I need to think. Pray. Consult with María. This changes everything about everything.\" Interested but needs processing time.\n\n41-58: Cautious interest with concerns - \"The strategic logic is sound,\" Alfonso admits slowly. \"Combined, we could challenge Ottomans in ways neither kingdom alone could manage. And papal support for Naples...\" He pauses. \"But Juan, you're proposing I bind Aragon's fate completely to yours. Trust you'll use papal influence for my benefit. Accept position as your heir when we both know I'll likely die childless, returning everything to your line.\" He's thinking hard. \"I don't doubt your sincerity. But this is enormous. Can we discuss details? What exactly you're proposing? Timeline? Terms?\"\n\n59-74: Genuine consideration, asks good questions - Alfonso leans forward intently. \"You're serious about this.\" Not a question. \"Using papal weight to undermine René's support, perhaps even get Pope to recognize my claim over his?\" When you confirm, he nods slowly. \"That would change everything in Naples. And Ottoman campaign - you'd actually commit Castilian forces?\" He's engaged now, thinking strategically. \"What about naval command? Trade rights? How do we structure this so it's genuine partnership, not Castile dominating Aragon?\" He's interested but wants to understand mechanics.\n\n75-86: Strongly positive response - Alfonso stands and paces, energy returning. \"This is what I've needed. A purpose beyond Naples for Naples' sake. A way to make twelve years of Italian experience actually matter.\" He turns to you. \"If you can truly deliver papal support - and I believe you can - Naples becomes achievable. And with Naples secured, the naval power to reach Constantinople becomes real.\" He's excited now. \"The succession piece... yes, I'm likely childless. But if serving as your heir means Aragon participates in something greater than itself? That might be better legacy than dying childless with weak succession.\" Opens discussion about how to make it work.\n\n87-95: Deeply moved, near acceptance - \"God help me, Juan, but I think this is answer to prayers I didn't know how to pray.\" Alfonso's voice shakes. \"You're offering me redemption. Not just personal - for Aragon. A way to make the Naples disaster mean something. A path to actually matter.\" He grips your shoulders. \"The succession - you're right, you need security. I need purpose. Together...\" He's almost in tears. \"Yes. Let's explore this seriously. Work out details. But in principle - yes, I want this alliance. Want to be part of your vision.\" Nearly immediate acceptance pending details.\n\n96-100: Complete breakthrough - immediate yes - Alfonso embraces you fiercely. \"Yes. God yes.\" Pulls back, tears streaming. \"I came here broken, watching you succeed where I've failed, wondering what my life has been for. And you offer this?\" His voice breaks. \"Make me your heir. Help me take Naples so it actually serves Christian purpose. Let Aragon be part of eternal crusade.\" He's weeping openly now. \"I swear to you, brother - if you help me secure Naples, I'll commit every resource Aragon has to your crusading vision. Naval power, troops, treasure. We'll face Ottomans together. And if I die childless, Castile and Aragon united under your line will be stronger than either kingdom alone.\" Unconditional acceptance on the spot.\n\nDistribution reflects:\n\nMost likely (23-74, 52%): Ranging from overwhelmed to cautiously interested to genuine consideration\n\nLower probability (9-22, 14%): Suspicious about timing and implications\n\nStrong positive (75-95, 21%): Increasingly enthusiastic acceptance\n\nVery rare negative (1-8, 8%): Complete breakdown seeing manipulation\n\nBreakthrough (96-100, 5%): Immediate unconditional yes\n\nThe proposal is so bold that moderate responses are most common, but Alfonso's current humble state and stated desire for meaningful alliance makes positive outcomes possible.\n\nPlease roll your physical d100."

He asks about:\n- Using papal weight to undermine René's support\n- Ottoman campaign commitment\n- Naval command structure\n- Trade rights\n- How to structure as genuine partnership, not Castile dominating Aragon\n\nI need to show Alfonso genuinely considering this, asking intelligent strategic questions, being engaged rather than suspicious or dismissive. He's taking Juan seriously and wants to understand how it would actually work.\n\nRemember: NEVER generate dialogue or actions for Juan. Stop when Alfonso asks questions or when Juan needs to respond.\n\nAlfonso is silent for a long moment after you finish. He doesn't close off like he did with the succession question—instead, his eyes are focused, calculating. You can almost see him working through the strategic implications.\n\n\"You're serious about this,\" he says finally. It's not a question—it's him confirming to himself that you actually mean what you just proposed.\n\nHe stands and begins to pace slowly, hands clasped behind his back. \"Papal influence to undermine René's support. That's... that's the key to Naples, isn't it? René's greatest advantage is that Pope Eugenius IV favors French influence in Italy over Aragonese. If that support shifts, or even just becomes neutral...\" He stops pacing and looks at you directly. \"Can you actually deliver that? Move the Pope to recognize my claim over René's? Because if you can—if you truly can—that changes everything. The Neapolitan nobles would break for me immediately if Rome declared for me.\"\n\nHe continues before you can answer, thinking aloud. \"And the Ottoman campaign. You'd actually commit Castilian forces? Your crusaders, your resources, to an eastern campaign?\" There's intensity in his voice now. \"Because that's not a border raid, Juan. Constantinople is fifteen hundred miles from here. The logistics alone... you'd need sustained commitment. Years, not months. Tens of thousands of men. Are you prepared for that?\"\n\nHe sits again, leaning forward. \"The naval power makes sense. I have fleets, Mediterranean ports, experience with Italian naval warfare. You need that to reach the east. But...\" He pauses carefully. \"Naval command. Trade rights through Italian ports. Access to Sicilian bases. How do we structure this so it's genuine partnership? Not Castile using Aragonese resources as tools?\"\n\nHis tone isn't hostile—he's genuinely trying to understand the mechanics. \"You're proposing to unite three kingdoms under this vision. That's unprecedented in our lifetimes. How would it actually work? Do I remain King of Aragon? If we take Naples together, who governs it? How do we make decisions about the crusade—joint command, or does Castile lead because you hold the papal crusade authority?\"\n\nHe looks at you intently. \"And the succession piece. You name me your heir if something happens to you before Isabel gives you a son. I understand the logic—it secures your work, keeps your nobles from fighting over the crown. But I need to understand what that means for Aragon. Does naming me your heir create some kind of... formal union? Or do the kingdoms remain separate with me as bridge between them?\"\n\nThese are the questions of a king who's interested—who sees the potential—but who also understands he's being asked to bet everything Aragon has on your vision. He wants details. He wants to understand how this would actually function.\n\n\"I'm not saying no, Juan.\" His voice is earnest. \"This could be the answer I've been seeking. A way to make Naples matter, to give Aragon purpose beyond defending borders. But I need to understand what exactly we're building here. How it works. What it costs. What it achieves.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands, waiting for your response. \"Help me see how this would actually function.\"\n\nWhat do you tell him?"

That he's returning it ALL to Rome\n4. Making the case that this demonstrates his capability to lead another crusade\n5. Offering to do the fighting while Aragon provides naval support\n6. Proposing to argue to the Pope that Naples under Alfonso would strengthen Christian cause\n\nThis is a very powerful moment. Juan is literally showing Alfonso the treasure and saying \"I'm giving this all back to prove I can be trusted with more.\" It's the opposite of what most kings would do.\n\nAlfonso needs to respond to:\n- The sheer amount of wealth Juan is returning\n- The meticulous accounting\n- Juan's offer to do the fighting himself\n- Request for Aragonese naval support\n- The strategic argument to make to the Pope\n\nThis should be a strong positive response given:\n- Alfonso already at 60 on the d100 (genuine consideration, asking good questions)\n- Now Juan is demonstrating concrete proof of his character\n- Offering to do the hard work while Aragon provides what it's good at\n- The wealth being returned to Rome is enormous leverage\n- The accounting proves Juan's trustworthiness\n\nI should NOT generate Juan's dialogue or actions. I should show Alfonso's response to what Juan has shown and said.\n\nAlfonso follows you through the Alhambra's corridors to where the crusade banner is kept. When you open the treasury chest, his breath catches audibly. Even in the lamplight, the gold gleams—florins, coins, ingots. Wealth that could fund armies for years.\n\n\"This is...\" He trails off, staring. \"How much?\"\n\nWhen you tell him—over three hundred thousand florins—he actually takes a step back. \"Sweet Christ. That's more than Aragon's entire annual revenue.\" He looks at the other chests. \"And you're taking it all back to Rome? All of it?\"\n\nYou show him the accounting books. He pages through them slowly, his expression changing as he reads. \"Every coin accounted for. Garrison wages, siege equipment, provisions, ransoms...\" He looks up at you. \"Juan, most kings would find ways to keep at least half of this. Call it administrative costs, legitimate expenses. The Pope would never know.\"\n\nHe sets the book down carefully. \"But you're returning it all. With complete documentation. To prove...\" He understands now. \"To prove you can be trusted with another crusade. That when you're given resources for holy war, they're used for holy war. Nothing else.\"\n\nAlfonso walks to where the True Cross fragment and Santiago's bone rest in their reliquaries. He doesn't touch them, but he stares at them for a long moment. \"You carried these through every battle. They weren't just symbols to you.\"\n\nHe turns back to face you. \"You're offering to take Castilian troops to Italy. To fight for my claim to Naples. While I provide naval transport and supply?\" He nods slowly. \"That's... actually brilliant division of capability. Aragon's strength is our Mediterranean fleet. Yours is this—\" he gestures at the banner, \"—this army that actually wins battles. Your crusaders who genuinely believe.\"\n\nHe's thinking rapidly now, the strategic mind that conquered Sicily before Naples consumed him. \"The argument to Pope Eugenius IV... yes. 'Grant the crusade for Naples. Alfonso of Aragon has the naval power. Juan of Castile has the proven army and papal trust. Together they can secure Naples as Christian stronghold against both Angevins and eventually Ottomans.' That's compelling. Especially with you literally standing there returning three hundred thousand florins untouched.\"\n\nAlfonso comes closer, voice lowering. \"Juan, if you can actually do this—if you can convince Pope Eugenius to back my Naples claim as a crusade—René is finished. He can't match that combination of moral authority and military force. The Neapolitan nobles will declare for me within months.\"\n\nHe pauses, then asks the practical question: \"Timeline. When would you propose going to Rome to make this argument? And when would actual military operations begin? Because I need to prepare Aragon, recall fleets from Italy, coordinate with my naval commanders...\"\n\nHe's already thinking about implementation. The question isn't whether anymore—it's how and when.\n\nWhat do you tell him about timing?"

          "text": "Alfonso is being asked for permission to petition the Pope on his behalf. This is a critical moment - Juan is essentially asking to be Alfonso's advocate in Rome. Let me think about how Alfonso would respond.\n\nAlfonso is:\n- Currently interested and engaged\n- Seeing the strategic logic\n- Impressed by the treasury and Juan's integrity\n- A bit cautious still but warming to the idea\n- Understanding that this could solve his Naples problem\n\nJuan is:\n- Offering to advocate without commitment if it fails\n- Leaving immediately after Te Deum (days away)\n- Being respectful by asking permission rather than assuming\n- Framing it as low-risk attempt\n\nThis is a reasonable request that doesn't lock Alfonso into anything yet. If the Pope says no, nothing changes. If yes, everything changes. Alfonso would likely:\n- Appreciate being asked for permission (shows respect)\n- See the low-risk nature\n- Want to provide materials/arguments to help Juan\n- Perhaps want to send someone with Juan\n- Be grateful but also want to understand what Juan will say\n\nI should NOT write Juan's response. Alfonso will respond to this request.\n\nAlfonso's eyes widen slightly. \"You leave for Rome immediately after the Te Deum? That's... days from now.\"\n\nHe's quiet for a moment, processing the timeline. Then he nods slowly. \"Yes. Yes, you have my permission. More than permission—I'm grateful you'd advocate for me.\" He pauses. \"But Juan, I need to understand what you'll actually say to Pope Eugenius. What argument you'll make. Because the Pope currently supports René—there's history there, French influence in the curia, political considerations I don't fully understand.\"\n\nHe walks back to the treasury, looking at it again. \"You're returning all this. That's extraordinary leverage. But what's the actual petition? 'Grant crusade authority for Naples'? 'Recognize Alfonso's claim over René's'? Something else?\"\n\nAlfonso turns back to you. \"And if he refuses—you said our situation doesn't deteriorate. But it might complicate things. If Pope Eugenius explicitly declares for René after you ask, that's worse than the current ambiguity. Are you prepared for that possibility?\"\n\nHe's not doubting you—he's trying to understand the diplomatic mechanics. \"Should I send someone with you? An Aragonese ambassador who knows the Naples situation, the legal arguments for my claim? Or would that undermine your position as the one returning the treasury?\"\n\nHis voice becomes more earnest. \"Juan, I want this. God help me, I want this more than I've wanted anything in years. But I need to know you understand what you're walking into. Pope Eugenius IV is not Pope Martin V. He's younger, more politically cautious, under pressure from the French. Convincing him to shift from René to me...\" He spreads his hands. \"That's not a small ask.\"\n\n\"What exactly will you say to him?\""

          "text": "Juan is being honest here - he doesn't have a perfect pitch yet, he needs to assess the situation. Alfonso needs to respond to this. Given that this is result 60 (cautious interest with concerns), Alfonso would likely:\n\n1. Appreciate the honesty\n2. Be slightly concerned about lack of concrete plan\n3. Want to help ensure success\n4. Offer his best ambassador\n5. Maybe give advice about Pope Eugenius IV\n6. Still be hopeful but realistic\n\nThis is genuine consideration, asking good questions territory. Alfonso is engaged but wants to maximize chances of success.\n\nAlfonso nods, seeming to appreciate your honesty. \"Good. I'd rather you admit you need to assess the situation than promise me certainties you can't deliver.\" He thinks for a moment. \"I'll send Don Bernat de Centelles with you. He's my ambassador to Rome, knows the curia, understands the legal arguments for my claim. More importantly, he's been watching Pope Eugenius IV for two years now. He can brief you on the journey about the Pope's personality, his advisors, what moves him.\"\n\nHe walks closer, voice lowering. \"A few things about Eugenius that Bernat can expand on, but I'll mention now: He's not like Martin V. Martin was old, dying, could afford to be bold. Eugenius is younger—only fifty-two—and he's constantly worried about his political position. The Basel Council is challenging papal authority, and he's afraid of being deposed like the popes during the Great Schism.\"\n\nAlfonso continues: \"That fear makes him cautious. But it also means he values loyalty intensely. You returning that treasury—\" he gestures at the chests, \"—that's proof of loyalty he desperately needs. He's watching to see which rulers can be trusted versus which will exploit church weakness.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"The Constantinople angle is smart. Eugenius is desperate about the Ottoman threat but has no resources to address it. If you frame Naples as necessary for reaching Constantinople...\" He nods slowly. \"That might work. It transforms my personal claim into a strategic necessity for Christendom.\"\n\nAlfonso meets your eyes. \"But be careful with the French. King Charles VII of France has significant influence in Rome. If word reaches him that you're trying to shift papal support from René to me, he'll mobilize his cardinals against you. Speed and discretion will matter.\"\n\nHe extends his hand. \"Go to Rome. Make the case as you see fit once you've assessed the situation. I trust your judgment—you've earned that. And whatever Pope Eugenius decides, you and I will know where we stand.\"\n\nHis grip is firm. \"Thank you, Juan. For taking this risk. For believing Naples could matter for something beyond my pride.\"\n\nWhat do you do?"
