      "summary": "The royal party travels from Toledo to Barcelona through winter terrain, a journey of roughly 150 leagues over 11 days. Roll 96 (Remarkable Fortune): The journey is triumphant — Aragonese villages celebrate the Reconquista hero, church bells ring in Zaragoza, and knights are showered with gifts. The remarkable event occurs in Fraga on the seventh day: Princess Catalina (20 months old) wanders away from her nursemaid Ines during a rest stop and finds a four-year-old boy named Tomas (the fuller's son) who has fallen into the Cinca River. Catalina picks up a fisherman's rope, throws it to the boy, and holds on while three men pull him out, saying 'No. Catalina helping.' The story spreads like wildfire — priests call it a miracle, and the town later builds a shrine called La Capilla de la Princesita. Juan lifts Catalina high and praises her for helping others, then reassures the nursemaid Ines that no blame falls on her. The column arrives in Barcelona to trumpets and a herald's announcement, where Queen Maria of Aragon waits to greet them.",

          "text": "The January sun hung low over the eastern Meseta, casting long shadows across the column that stretched back nearly half a league along the road toward Zaragoza. The Castilian royal train had crossed into Aragon two days prior—the frontier marked not by walls or gates but by a change in language at the taverns and a subtle shift in the stone from which villages were built.\n\nPrincess Catalina, twenty months old and wrapped in heavy wool against the morning chill, sat before her father on Hidalgo's broad back. She had been awake since before dawn, demanding to start the day's ride early because—as she had explained with irrefutable toddler logic—\"horses wake with sun, Catalina wake with horses.\"\n\nThe road here climbed gently through scrubland dotted with olive groves, the Sierra de Albarracín visible as a blue smudge to the south. Ahead, perhaps three leagues distant, the towers of Zaragoza would become visible by midday—the ancient seat of Aragon's kings before Barcelona claimed primacy.\n\nCaptain Fernán rode up alongside Juan, his breath visible in the cold air. \"The scouts report the road clear to Zaragoza, Majesty. The Aragonese corregidor sent word ahead—he's preparing the old alfóndiga for our lodging. Says it's the finest building available outside the Archbishop's palace.\"\n\nBehind them, the crimson carriage rolled steadily, its wheels finding the ruts carved by countless merchant wagons on this ancient trade route. Inside, Queen Lucia dozed against the cushions—the morning sickness that had begun manifesting three weeks past made horseback riding inadvisable until her stomach settled each afternoon. Doña Leonor de Almeida sat with her, along with Donna Francesca, the Italian ladies having established a rotating watch to ensure the Queen was never alone during her discomfort.\n\nThe 700 knights of the Military Orders rode in formation behind the royal party—a river of black, red, and green crosses that drew crowds in every village they passed. Peasants lined the roads to watch them pass, some crossing themselves, others simply staring at the largest concentration of Christian military power most had ever seen outside of war.\n\n\"Papá,\" Catalina said, tugging at Juan's sleeve. \"When Barcelona?\"\n\n\"Three more days, pequeña,\" Juan replied. \"First we sleep in Zaragoza. Then we ride through more mountains. Then Barcelona, where Aunt María lives.\"\n\n\"Aunt María nice?\"\n\n\"Very nice. And she has missed your father very much.\"\n\nCatalina considered this with the gravity of a philosopher. \"Catalina nice too. Aunt María like Catalina.\"\n\n\"Of that,\" Juan said, kissing the top of her hooded head, \"I have no doubt.\"\n\nThe column continued east under the pale winter sky, the horses' breath rising like prayers toward heaven.\n\nWhat does King Juan do during the journey to Zaragoza?"

          "text": "A sensible approach—this journey spans roughly 150 leagues through winter terrain, crossing from Castile through Aragon to the Mediterranean coast. Let me construct a proper chaos roll.\n\nJOURNEY TO BARCELONA: D100 CHAOS TABLE\n\nContext: Mid-January 1434. Royal party traveling Toledo → Zaragoza → Barcelona. Approximately 10-12 days of travel through winter conditions. Party includes King Juan, Queen Lucia (newly pregnant, experiencing morning sickness), Princess Catalina (20 months), 700 Military Order knights, royal household, and supply train.\n\nSuccess Factors (favorable conditions)\n\nWinter is mild this year; no major storms reported\n\nAragon is allied territory; Queen María expects them\n\nWell-established trade routes with regular waypoints\n\nLarge military escort deters bandits\n\nAdvance riders sent ahead to arrange lodging\n\nCatalina has been trained for travel; knows riding routine\n\nFailure Factors (risks and obstacles)\n\nLucia's pregnancy makes her vulnerable to exhaustion and illness\n\nCatalina is still a toddler; illness or tantrums possible\n\nMountain passes between Zaragoza and Barcelona can be treacherous in winter\n\n700 knights strain local resources for food and lodging\n\nHorses can go lame, wagons can break\n\nWinter days are short; limited travel hours\n\nD100 TABLE\n\n1-5: Disaster\nMultiple serious problems compound. Possibilities include: severe illness strikes Lucia requiring extended halt; mountain pass becomes impassable forcing lengthy detour; Catalina falls seriously ill; horse plague affects significant portion of cavalry mounts; combination of accidents and weather delays journey by weeks. The expedition's timeline is severely compromised.\n\n6-15: Significant Difficulties\nOne major problem dominates the journey. Heavy snow closes the direct mountain route for several days; Lucia's morning sickness becomes severe enough to require multi-day rest; accident injures key household member; supply wagon breaks an axle in difficult terrain forcing delays; local tensions with Aragonese towns over billeting 700 knights. Arrival in Barcelona delayed by 4-7 days.\n\n16-30: Troubled Journey\nPersistent minor problems accumulate. Lucia exhausted and miserable throughout; Catalina has difficult days requiring frequent stops; weather turns cold and wet making travel unpleasant; several horses go lame; lodgings are inadequate in smaller towns; the knights grumble about conditions. Everyone arrives tired and irritable, 2-3 days behind schedule.\n\n31-50: Uneventful Passage\nThe journey proceeds without notable incident. Weather is cold but manageable; Lucia copes with her condition adequately; Catalina has good days and difficult days in normal proportion; lodgings vary from adequate to comfortable; no significant delays. Arrival roughly on schedule, party in reasonable condition.\n\n51-70: Pleasant Journey\nFavorable conditions predominate. Weather holds clear and dry; Lucia's morning sickness proves manageable; Catalina delights in the adventure and behaves well; Aragonese towns welcome the Castilian king warmly; good lodgings available throughout. Arrival on schedule with party in good spirits.\n\n71-85: Excellent Progress\nEverything aligns favorably. Unseasonably mild weather; Lucia feels better than expected; Catalina charms everyone she meets; Aragonese nobles along the route offer hospitality and fresh horses; mountain passes clear and dry. Possible arrival 1-2 days ahead of schedule. Journey becomes genuinely enjoyable family experience.\n\n86-95: Triumphant Procession\nThe journey becomes a celebration. Word of the Reconquista's completion has spread; Aragonese villages turn out to cheer the crusading king; local nobles compete to host the royal family; Lucia blooms despite pregnancy; Catalina becomes a beloved figure along the route. The political benefits of being seen traveling through Aragon manifest clearly. Relationships strengthened, goodwill generated.\n\n96-100: Remarkable Fortune\nSomething unexpected and significantly positive occurs beyond mere good travel. Possibilities: encounter with important figure who provides valuable intelligence or opportunity; discovery of something meaningful along the route; spontaneous demonstration of Aragonese-Castilian solidarity that has lasting political implications; Lucia and Juan experience profound personal moment that deepens their bond; Catalina does something that becomes legendary in local memory.\n\nReady to roll when you give the word, Your Majesty."

          "text": "A roll of 96—Remarkable Fortune. Something unexpected and significantly positive occurs beyond mere good travel.\n\nLet me consider what could genuinely matter at this moment in the campaign, given where Juan is heading and what lies ahead...\n\nThe journey began well and never faltered.\n\nThe weather held clear across the Meseta—cold but dry, the winter sun bright enough to warm faces by midday. Lucia's morning sickness, which had plagued her in Toledo, eased once they were moving; she claimed the rhythm of the carriage settled her stomach better than lying still. By the third day, she was riding Tormenta again in the afternoons, her color returned, laughing at something Donna Francesca said.\n\nCatalina proved herself the seasoned traveler her father had trained. She alternated between Hidalgo and the carriage without complaint, napped when told, and provided running commentary on everything she saw—sheep (\"fluffy\"), olive trees (\"not fluffy\"), mountains (\"big rocks\"), and the knights behind them (\"Papa's friends with crosses\"). The Aragonese villagers who lined the roads to watch them pass fell in love with the little princess who waved her riding crop at them like a tiny monarch reviewing troops.\n\nWord of the Reconquista had indeed spread. In Calatayud, the town council presented Juan with a silver cup engraved with the date of Granada's fall. In Zaragoza, the Archbishop himself came out to bless the column, and church bells rang for an hour. The 700 knights, far from straining local resources, found themselves showered with gifts—local wines, cured hams, warm bread pressed into their hands by women who wanted to touch men who had driven the Moors from Iberia forever.\n\nBut the remarkable fortune came on the eighth day, in the mountains between Zaragoza and Lérida.\n\nThe column had stopped at midday in a high valley, the horses watered at a mountain stream while the party ate a cold meal of bread and cheese. Catalina had fallen asleep in the carriage, and Lucia sat beside Juan on a flat rock, watching the knights spread across the meadow.\n\nA rider approached from the east—not one of their scouts, but a man in the livery of the Crown of Aragon, his horse lathered from hard riding.\n\nCaptain Fernán intercepted him, spoke briefly, then brought him forward.\n\n\"Majesty,\" the messenger said, dropping to one knee. \"I am sent by Her Majesty Queen María. She heard you were coming and dispatched me four days ago to find you on the road.\"\n\n\"My sister is well?\" Juan asked, immediately alert.\n\n\"Very well, Majesty. But she sends urgent news she thought you should have before you reach Barcelona.\" The messenger produced a sealed letter. \"She said you would understand when you read it.\"\n\nJuan broke the seal—María's familiar hand, but written hastily, the letters cramped as if she'd been racing against the courier's departure.\n\nBrother—\n\nA ship arrived in Barcelona three days past from Constantinople. It carried an embassy from Emperor John VIII himself—not to Aragon, but seeking YOU. They learned in Rome that you were returning to Iberia and have been chasing your trail ever since.\n\nThe ambassador is a man named Georgios Sphrantzes. He is, I am told, the Emperor's closest confidant—not a minor functionary but someone who speaks with the Emperor's own voice. He has been waiting in Barcelona for six days already, growing more anxious by the hour.\n\nJuan, he carries a personal letter from the Emperor. The Greeks know about your 700 knights. They know about your pledge to Cardinal Cesarini. And they have come to ask for MORE.\n\nI do not know what they will propose. But Sphrantzes told me privately that Constantinople may not survive another year without substantial Western intervention. He said the Emperor chose to send his most trusted man to YOU specifically—not to the Pope, not to the other kings of Christendom, but to the King of Castile who actually completed a crusade.\n\nCome quickly. This man has risked a winter voyage across the Mediterranean to speak with you. Whatever he carries, it is not a small thing.\n\nYour sister,\nMaría\n\nJuan read the letter twice, then handed it silently to Lucia.\n\nShe scanned it, her grey-green eyes widening. \"The Emperor's own ambassador. Waiting for you.\"\n\n\"For us,\" Juan corrected quietly. \"You are Queen of Castile. You should hear whatever he has to say.\"\n\nLucia looked at him—that measuring gaze he had come to recognize, the one that preceded her most incisive observations. \"You expected knights to be enough. A garrison force. Seven hundred men to hold walls.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And now the Emperor himself sends his closest friend to ask for more.\" She folded the letter carefully. \"What will you say if he asks you to lead an army east?\"\n\nThe mountain wind stirred Juan's cloak. Around them, the 700 knights who had trained all winter for Constantinople sat eating their midday meal, unaware that the nature of their mission might be about to change.\n\n\"I will listen,\" Juan said finally. \"And then I will pray. And then I will decide.\"\n\nHe stood and called for Captain Fernán.\n\n\"Change of plans. We ride hard for Barcelona. The Queen and Princess travel at whatever pace keeps them comfortable, but I want a fast party ahead—myself, twenty knights, spare horses. We can reach Barcelona in two days if we push.\"\n\n\"Juan.\" Lucia's voice was quiet but firm. He turned.\n\n\"I did not come on this journey to be left behind with the baggage,\" she said. \"If you ride ahead, I ride with you. Catalina can travel with Donna Francesca and Doña Leonor in the carriage—they will keep her safe and comfortable. But I will be beside you when you meet this ambassador.\"\n\nShe stood, brushing dust from her traveling gown, and met his eyes with the steel he had first glimpsed in a Toledo garden four months ago.\n\n\"We are partners, you said. Partners do not wait in the rear while history is being made.\"\n\nWhat does King Juan decide? Does he accept Lucia's insistence on riding ahead with him, or does he ask her to travel more slowly given her pregnancy? And does he have any instructions for the column before departing?"

Let me properly narrate the journey with the 96 roll focused on Catalina's legendary moment.\n\nThe journey began well and never faltered.\n\nThe weather held clear across the Meseta—cold but dry, the winter sun bright enough to warm faces by midday.

The 700 knights, far from straining local resources, found themselves showered with gifts—local wines, cured hams, warm bread pressed into their hands by women who wanted to touch men who had driven the Moors from Iberia forever.\n\nBut the remarkable thing happened on the seventh day, in the town of Fraga, halfway between Zaragoza and Lérida.\n\nIt was a rest day—the horses needed shoeing, two wagon axles required repair, and Lucia had woken pale and queasy after a difficult night. The royal party had taken rooms at the largest inn Fraga could offer, a rambling stone building called La Casa del Puente for its view of the old Roman bridge over the Cinca River.\n\nBy midafternoon, the adults were occupied. Juan was meeting with the local alcalde about provisioning. Lucia slept in the upstairs chamber, Donna Francesca watching over her. Doña Leonor had gone to the market to purchase fresh fruit. The nursemaid—a young woman named Inés—had been minding Catalina in the inn's small courtyard.\n\nWhat happened next was pieced together afterward from a dozen witnesses.\n\nInés had turned away for perhaps three minutes—she would later weep and beg forgiveness, certain she would be dismissed—to help a servant carry water. When she turned back, Princess Catalina was gone.\n\nThe courtyard gate stood open. A merchant's cart had passed through moments before, and in the bustle, a twenty-month-old princess had simply walked out into Fraga.\n\nThe alarm spread quickly. Captain Fernán mobilized every available man. The town was not large—perhaps two thousand souls—but it was crowded with the Castilian column, and the streets were a maze of medieval alleys branching off from the market square.\n\nFor nearly an hour, soldiers searched. Lucia, woken by the commotion, stood white-faced in the inn's doorway, Donna Francesca gripping her arm. The townspeople joined the hunt, calling \"¡La Princesa! ¡La Princesita!\"\n\nThey found her at the river.\n\nThe old Roman bridge had a low stone parapet—knee-height to an adult, chest-height to a toddler. Below it, the Cinca ran cold and fast with winter snowmelt, deep enough to drown a grown man.\n\nA crowd had gathered at the bridge's eastern approach, blocking traffic. When Captain Fernán pushed through, sword drawn and face thunderous, he stopped dead.\n\nPrincess Catalina sat on the cobblestones beside the parapet, her small hand resting on the head of a child—a boy of perhaps four years, soaking wet and shivering violently, wrapped in Catalina's own wool traveling cloak.\n\nAn old woman was telling the story to anyone who would listen, gesturing wildly:\n\n\"The boy—he's Tomás, the fuller's son—he was playing on the parapet, the little fool, and he slipped. Went right into the river. His mother screamed, but who could reach him? The current had him. He was going under.\"\n\nShe pointed at Catalina.\n\n\"Then this little one—this baby—she walked right up to the bridge like she knew exactly where she was going. She didn't cry, didn't call for help. She picked up a rope that the fishermen leave coiled by the mooring post—how did she even know it was there?—and she threw it. Threw it right to the boy. He grabbed it, and she held on.\"\n\nThe old woman crossed herself.\n\n\"She's no bigger than a lamb, but she held that rope while three men ran to pull the boy out. Wouldn't let go. When they tried to take it from her, she said—\" the woman's voice broke with something between laughter and tears, \"—she said, 'No. Catalina helping.'\"\n\nBy the time Juan arrived, the fuller and his wife were on their knees before their princess, weeping, trying to kiss her hands. Catalina looked profoundly unimpressed by this attention. She was asking, repeatedly, \"Boy warm now? Boy not cold?\"\n\nThe story spread through Fraga like fire through dry brush. By evening, the priests were calling it a miracle—the Holy Virgin guiding the infant princess's steps. By the next morning, when the column prepared to depart, half the town had gathered to see her off.\n\nCatalina, restored to her father's saddle and wrapped in a new cloak (the old one having been kept by Tomás's family as a relic), surveyed the crowd with evident satisfaction.\n\n\"Catalina helped,\" she announced to no one in particular. \"Boy was wet. Now boy is dry.\"\n\nThe story would be told in Fraga for generations. They would build a small shrine at the bridge—La Capilla de la Princesita—and every year on the anniversary, the town would process to the river to give thanks. Tomás the fuller's son would grow up to become a priest, and he would tell the story of the princess who saved him until the day he died, always ending the same way:\n\n\"She was not yet two years old. And she did not hesitate.\"\n\nThe column is ready to continue toward Barcelona. What does King Juan do?"

Catalina strong.\"\n\nShe flexed her tiny arms to demonstrate this strength, a gesture so earnest and so absurd that several of the watching knights had to look away to hide their grins.\n\nWhen Juan lowered her back to his chest, she patted his cheek with one small hand—a gesture she had learned from Lucia, a sign of approval bestowed upon those who had pleased her.\n\n\"Papá proud,\" she observed. It was not a question.\n\nNearby, the fuller's wife was weeping again, clutching her son Tomás against her skirts. The boy stared at Catalina with the wide-eyed reverence of a child who has been touched by something he does not yet understand but will spend his whole life trying to.\n\nDoña Leonor de Almeida, standing with the other ladies near the carriage, wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. She had known Queen Isabel—had held Catalina the night of her birth, when Isabel had nearly died bringing her into the world. And now she was watching that same child, not yet two years old, being celebrated for saving a life.\n\nYour daughter, she thought, sending the words toward heaven. Your daughter, Isabel. Look what she has become.\n\nCaptain Fernán approached and waited at a respectful distance, his face carefully neutral though his eyes betrayed something softer.\n\n\"The column is formed and ready, Majesty.

I will never—she will never leave my sight again, I swear it on my soul.\"\n\nShe kissed the hem of his cloak before the other ladies helped her to her feet. Donna Francesca gave her a handkerchief and a firm pat on the shoulder—the Italian woman's way of saying enough weeping, compose yourself.\n\nThe column departed Fraga to the sound of church bells and cheering crowds. Catalina, seated before her father on Hidalgo, waved her riding crop with the gravity of a general acknowledging her troops.\n\nThe remaining days passed in the golden haze that sometimes blesses winter travel. The weather held. The roads were dry. Lucia's color improved steadily, and by the second day after Fraga she was racing Tormenta against Juan's Hidalgo across an open meadow while Catalina shrieked encouragement from Doña Leonor's arms.\n\nThe story of Fraga ran ahead of them like wildfire. In Lérida, the bishop himself came out to bless \"the little saint.\" In Cervera, children lined the streets holding rope—a gesture that made Catalina frown in confusion until Lucia explained they were honoring her. In Igualada, a local nobleman presented Catalina with a wooden horse carved especially for her, which she immediately named \"Rope\" in commemoration of her achievement.\n\nOn the afternoon of the eleventh day since leaving Toledo, the column crested the final ridge of the coastal range and saw Barcelona spread before them—red rooftops tumbling down toward the glittering Mediterranean, the great cathedral rising above the old Roman walls, ships crowding the harbor like floating houses.\n\nCatalina stared at the sea—the first time she had ever seen it.\n\n\"Big water,\" she said finally, her voice hushed with genuine awe. \"Very big water.\"\n\n\"That's the sea, pequeña,\" Lucia said, riding up alongside them. \"And somewhere beyond it is Rome, where I was born. And beyond that, Constantinople, where your father's knights will go to help people who need them.\"\n\nCatalina considered this. \"Catalina help Constantinople too?\"\n\n\"Someday, perhaps. When you are older.\"\n\n\"Catalina older soon,\" the princess declared firmly, as though aging were simply a matter of sufficient determination.\n\nThe gates of Barcelona opened before them. Trumpets sounded from the walls. A herald's voice rang out across the afternoon air:\n\n\"His Most Catholic Majesty Juan the Second, King of Castile and León, Conqueror of Granada! Her Majesty Queen Lucia! Her Royal Highness the Infanta Catalina!\"\n\nAnd there, waiting in the plaza before the cathedral, surrounded by the nobles of Aragon and attended by her household, stood Queen María—Juan's sister, regent of Aragon in her husband Alfonso's absence.\n\nShe was thirty-one years old, tall like all the Trastámaras, her dark hair threaded with the first hints of grey. She had not seen her brother in nearly four years—not since before the Reconquista, before his marriage to Isabel, before everything that had transformed the young king she remembered into the man who rode toward her now.\n\nHer composure held for precisely three seconds. Then she was moving forward, protocol forgotten, her ladies scrambling to keep up.\n\n\"Juan,\" she called out, her voice cracking on his name. \"Oh, Juan.\"\n\nWhat does King Juan do?"

When she finally pulled back, her eyes were bright with tears, though she was laughing.\n\n\"Look at you,\" she said, touching his face with both hands as if to confirm he was real. \"The boy who came through here four years ago, terrified he was in love with the wrong woman—and now you return a conqueror with a wife and daughter.\" She shook her head in wonder. \"I prayed for you every day, Juan. Every single day. When word came of Granada's fall, I wept for an hour. The servants thought someone had died.\"\n\nShe released him and straightened, visibly collecting herself back into the dignity expected of Aragon's regent. But her smile remained—warm and unguarded in a way she rarely permitted herself in public.\n\nAt the mention of Lucia and Catalina, María turned toward where the Queen of Castile was being helped down from Tormenta by Donna Francesca. Lucia approached with the measured grace she had perfected in Ferrara's courts, but there was uncertainty in her grey-green eyes—she was meeting her husband's sister for the first time, a woman who had known Juan far longer than she had.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Lucia said, dropping into a formal curtsey. \"I have heard much of you from your brother. He speaks of your wisdom with great—\"\n\n\"None of that,\" María interrupted gently, stepping forward to take Lucia's hands and raise her up. \"You are my sister now. We shall be María and Lucia to each other, at least when the ambassadors are not watching.\"\n\nShe studied Lucia's face with frank curiosity—not unkindly, but with the assessing gaze of a woman who had spent years navigating royal politics.\n\n\"Italian,\" María observed. \"Ferrarese, yes? I can see it in the cheekbones. And my brother writes that you are formidable.\" A smile tugged at her lips. \"Good. He needs someone formidable. The last time he was here, he nearly threw away a crusade for a pair of pretty eyes. I trust you will keep him focused.\"\n\nBefore Lucia could respond, a small imperious voice cut through the moment.\n\n\"Down.\"\n\nDoña Leonor had carried Catalina forward, but the princess was squirming with obvious intent, reaching toward the ground. Once set on her feet, she straightened her traveling cloak—the new one, since the old had become a relic in Fraga—and walked directly up to Queen María with the confident stride of someone who had recently saved a life and knew her own worth.\n\nShe stopped before her aunt, looked up, and conducted a thorough inspection. María, to her credit, stood very still and submitted to this examination.\n\n\"You are Papá's sister,\" Catalina announced finally.\n\n\"I am,\" María confirmed gravely.\n\n\"Like Fernando is Catalina's brother.\"\n\n\"Exactly so.\"\n\nCatalina nodded, satisfied with this evidence of proper family structure. Then she raised her arms in the universal toddler demand.\n\n\"Up. Catalina tired. You carry now.\"\n\nMaría's composure cracked completely. She laughed—a full, delighted sound—and swept Catalina into her arms.\n\n\"Oh, you are exactly like your father was at this age,\" she said. \"Giving orders to everyone and expecting immediate obedience.\" She settled Catalina on her hip with the practiced ease of a woman who had raised children of her own. \"I see you have already conquered Aragon, little one. The whole kingdom is talking about the Princess of the Rope.\"\n\n\"Catalina helped,\" the princess confirmed. \"Boy was wet.\"\n\n\"So I heard.\" María looked over Catalina's head at Juan, her expression soft with an emotion beyond words. \"She has Isabel's eyes,\" she said quietly. \"Did you know? The shape of them. The way they watch everything.\"\n\nThe formal reception could wait no longer—the nobles of Aragon were growing restless, and protocol demanded acknowledgment. But María kept Catalina on her hip as she led the way toward the cathedral plaza, and the people of Barcelona watched their regent carry the little Castilian princess as though she were her own.\n\n\"You will stay in the Palau Reial,\" María said over her shoulder to Juan and Lucia. \"I have prepared the old king's chambers—our father stayed there when he visited Barcelona. And there is much to discuss.\" Her voice dropped slightly. \"Alfonso writes from Naples. The situation there is... complex. But that is for tomorrow. Tonight, we feast. Tonight, I have my brother back.\"\n\nWhat does King Juan do?"

Now I have a clear picture. Let me construct the d100 table based on the historical situation and the alternate history changes Juan has made:\n\nNAPLES CAMPAIGN STATUS: D100 CHAOS TABLE\n\nHistorical Context (January 1434)\n\nIn real history:\n\nQueen Joanna II of Naples is elderly (63), childless, and erratic\n\nShe has flip-flopped between Alfonso of Aragon and Louis III of Anjou multiple times\n\nApril 1433: Joanna disinherited Louis III\n\nJune 1433: Joanna re-adopted Louis III (again)\n\nLouis III currently holds most of the Kingdom of Naples as Duke of Calabria\n\nAlfonso V is in Sicily, preparing forces, waiting for opportunity\n\nLouis III will die of malaria in November 1434 (historical)\n\nRené of Anjou (Louis's brother) is currently a prisoner of Philip of Burgundy\n\nPope Eugenius IV is the feudal overlord of Naples and a key player\n\nAlternate History Changes (Juan's interventions):\n\nJuan provided additional florins to Alfonso at Fernando's baptism (autumn 1433)\n\nPope Eugenius IV now supports Alfonso's claim (Juan's advocacy)\n\nThe three-kingdom alliance concept (Castile-Aragon-Naples) is in development\n\nAlfonso witnessed the Reconquista's completion and experienced spiritual reflection\n\nCastile's prestige and military reputation are at an all-time high\n\nSuccess Factors\n\nPapal support for Alfonso's claim (major diplomatic advantage)\n\nAdditional Castilian florins funding Alfonso's preparations\n\nAlfonso has been preparing in Sicily since 1432—fleet and army ready\n\nLouis III is sickly (historically dies November 1434)\n\nRené of Anjou is still imprisoned by Burgundy—cannot intervene\n\nJoanna's erratic behavior alienates supporters\n\nNeapolitan barons increasingly favor stability over Angevin chaos\n\nFailure Factors\n\nJoanna is still alive and nominally controls Naples\n\nLouis III currently holds most of the kingdom\n\nMilan (Visconti) historically supports Angevin claims against Aragon\n\nGenoa's fleet is formidable—historically defeats Alfonso at Ponza (1435)\n\nAlfonso's previous Naples attempts (1421-1423) ended in humiliation\n\nAlfonso must balance Naples ambitions with governing Aragon through María\n\nWar is expensive; even with Castilian aid, resources are finite\n\nD100 TABLE: Naples Campaign Status (as of January 1434)\n\n1-10: Serious Setback\nAlfonso's preparations have suffered a major blow. Possibilities: Genoese naval raid destroyed part of his fleet in Sicily; key Neapolitan baron who promised support switched to Louis III; disease swept through Alfonso's army in Sicily; Milan has sent substantial aid to Louis III; Joanna has reconciled firmly with Louis and revoked all Aragonese claims permanently. Alfonso writes to María that he may need to abandon Naples entirely for now.\n\n11-25: Stalled Progress\nThe situation remains frozen in place. Alfonso sits in Sicily with his forces, unable to move. Louis III holds Calabria firmly. Joanna continues her erratic behavior but has not died or created an opening. The Castilian florins helped maintain Alfonso's army, but have not enabled any advance. Papal support is helpful diplomatically but has not translated to military advantage. María reports her husband is frustrated and increasingly impatient.\n\n26-40: Holding Pattern with Minor Gains\nSmall progress. Alfonso has secured additional Neapolitan barons to his cause through diplomacy. His fleet is complete and ready. Louis III's health is reportedly failing. The papal endorsement has weakened Angevin legitimacy among some Italian powers. But no decisive action has occurred. Alfonso is waiting—either for Joanna or Louis to die, or for the right moment to strike. The situation is promising but unresolved.\n\n41-60: Favorable Developments\nThe tide is turning toward Aragon. Louis III's health has deteriorated significantly—he is bedridden in Calabria and his forces are demoralized. Several major Neapolitan barons have openly declared for Alfonso. The Castilian money funded a successful diplomatic mission that neutralized potential Milanese intervention. Joanna, sensing which way the wind blows, has made secret overtures to re-adopt Alfonso (again). Alfonso is preparing to move—expects action by summer 1434.\n\n61-75: Significant Progress\nAlfonso has achieved a breakthrough. He has landed forces in southern Italy and secured a major coastal stronghold (possibly Reggio or Taranto). Louis III is dying—everyone knows it—and the Angevin cause is collapsing. Multiple Neapolitan nobles have switched sides. The papal endorsement combined with Castilian prestige has isolated the Angevins diplomatically. René of Anjou remains imprisoned and cannot intervene. Alfonso writes that Naples will be his within the year.\n\n76-90: Major Success\nThe campaign has succeeded beyond expectations. Louis III has died (accelerated from November to earlier in 1434), and Alfonso has moved immediately. He controls significant territory in the kingdom. Joanna, facing reality, has formally re-adopted Alfonso and named him her sole heir—this time with papal confirmation that makes revocation impossible. René of Anjou's claim is effectively dead. Alfonso expects to be King of Naples within months of Joanna's death (she is 63 and in poor health).\n\n91-100: Triumph\nSomething extraordinary has occurred. Possibilities: Joanna II herself has died unexpectedly and Alfonso has already been proclaimed King of Naples by the barons; Alfonso achieved a stunning military victory that broke Angevin power decisively; René of Anjou, from his Burgundian prison, has formally renounced all claims to Naples in exchange for some consideration; Milan has switched to actively supporting Alfonso. The three-kingdom alliance (Castile-Aragon-Naples) is no longer a dream—it is imminent reality.\n\nReady to roll when you give the word, Your Majesty."

          "text": "A roll of 63—Significant Progress. Alfonso has achieved a breakthrough.\n\nMaría waited until the formal reception had concluded and the nobles had dispersed to their lodgings before she drew Juan aside. They walked together through the cloisters of the Palau Reial, their footsteps echoing on ancient stone, while Lucia settled Catalina in the royal apartments with Doña Leonor.\n\n\"I have news from Alfonso,\" María said quietly, her breath misting in the January evening. \"A courier arrived three days ago from Sicily. I wanted to tell you in person, not in front of the Aragonese court.\"\n\nShe produced a letter from her sleeve—the seal already broken, the paper worn from multiple readings.\n\n\"Louis of Anjou is dying. The physicians give him weeks, perhaps a month or two at most. The malaria he contracted last autumn—it never truly left him. He has been bedridden in Cosenza since November, unable to ride, barely able to hold a quill.\"\n\nMaría's voice carried the careful neutrality of a regent delivering a report, but her eyes betrayed something more—hope, perhaps, after years of watching her husband pour treasure and blood into his Italian obsession.\n\n\"Alfonso landed forces at Reggio two weeks ago. Not a full invasion—a positioning. The Calabrian barons who had been waiting to see which way the wind blew are now declaring for Aragon. Three major houses switched allegiance in the past month alone. The Count of Catanzaro. The Duke of Sessa. The Prince of Taranto himself.\"\n\nShe handed Juan the letter.\n\n\"The papal endorsement you secured—Juan, you cannot know what that meant. The Angevins had always claimed legitimacy through Rome. When Eugenius declared for Alfonso, it cut the ground from beneath them. Italian princes who would never have risked supporting Aragon against a pope-backed Angevin are now free to follow their interests.\"\n\nThe letter was in Alfonso's own hand—cramped and hurried, written by a man with too much to do and not enough hours:\n\nBrother—\n\nBy the time you read this, I expect Louis of Anjou will be dead or near enough. His brother René sits in a Burgundian prison and cannot intervene. The old queen clings to life in Naples, but she has sent secret envoys to me—again offering adoption, again promising the succession. This time I have demanded papal confirmation before I accept. Eugenius has agreed. When Joanna signs, it will be irrevocable.\n\nThe money you sent bought me six months. Six months of feeding soldiers, maintaining ships, bribing officials. It was enough. By summer, I will control half the kingdom. By this time next year, God willing, I will be crowned in Naples.\n\nYou asked at Fernando's baptism what I learned from my humiliations. I learned patience. I learned that Naples cannot be seized—it must be inherited, legally, with the Church's blessing and the barons' consent. You gave me the Church. The barons are giving me their consent. Joanna will give me the inheritance.\n\nThe three kingdoms, Juan. Castile, Aragon, Naples. Our father's sons ruling the western Mediterranean from Toledo to Sicily. It is no longer a dream.\n\nCome to Naples when you can. I want you to see what we are building together.\n\nYour brother in all things,\nAlfonso\n\nMaría watched Juan read, her arms folded against the cold.\n\n\"He has changed,\" she said softly. \"The defeat at Ponza—being captured, being ransomed, the humiliation of it—I thought it would break him. Instead it... refined him. He writes differently now. He thinks differently. Less glory, more strategy.\"\n\nShe paused, looking out over the darkened courtyard.\n\n\"He speaks of you constantly in his letters. 'Juan would understand.' 'Juan would approve.' 'When Juan hears of this.' You have become his measure, brother. The king who actually finished what he started.\"\n\nFrom somewhere in the palace, a child's laughter echoed—Catalina, probably, resisting the efforts to put her to bed after so much excitement.\n\n\"He asks about your Constantinople expedition,\" María added. \"He wants to know if there is anything Aragon can provide. Ships. Supplies. Men, even, if you need them.\" She smiled slightly. \"He says that if Castile is going to save the Eastern Empire, Aragon should not be left out of the glory.\"\n\nWhat does King Juan do?"

And I should warn you, brother, it will not be entirely simple.\"\n\nARAGONESE NOBLES' RECEPTION: D100 TABLE\n\nContext\n\nJuan is visiting Barcelona as King of Castile—the man who completed the Reconquista, brother to Queen María, and brother-in-law to their absent King Alfonso. This is framed as \"a brother visiting his sister,\" but everyone understands the political implications. Castile's prestige is at its zenith. Aragon's king is absent pursuing Italian dreams while his wife governs in his stead.\n\nSuccess Factors (favorable conditions)\n\nJuan completed the Reconquista—legendary achievement that resonates across Iberia\n\nThe \"Princess of the Rope\" story from Fraga has already spread\n\nMaría has governed well and speaks highly of her brother\n\nAlfonso's letters praise Juan; the absent king's approval carries weight\n\nCastile-Aragon alliance benefits both kingdoms\n\nPapal support for Alfonso came partly through Juan's advocacy\n\nJuan brings 700 crusading knights—impressive display of Castilian power\n\nMany Aragonese nobles fought alongside Castilians in past campaigns\n\nFailure Factors (sources of tension)\n\nHistorical Castile-Aragon rivalry runs deep (centuries of border conflicts)\n\nSome nobles resent Castilian influence over their absent king\n\nAlfonso's Italian obsession drains Aragonese resources—some blame the alliance\n\nCatalan merchants compete with Castilian trade interests\n\nJuan's power and prestige may feel threatening to Aragonese pride\n\nMaría rules as regent; some nobles chafe under a woman's governance and may resent her Castilian brother's visit as interference\n\nThe sheer size of Juan's escort (700 knights) could feel like intimidation rather than honor\n\nSome may wonder: is Juan here to strengthen alliance or to dominate a weakened Aragon?\n\nD100 TABLE: Aragonese Nobles' Initial Reception\n\n1-10: Hostile Undercurrent\nThe reception is formally correct but cold. Powerful Catalan nobles barely conceal their resentment—they see Juan's visit as Castilian swagger, rubbing their faces in Aragon's diminished state while their king chases Italian fantasies. Pointed comments about \"Castilian ambitions\" and \"the burdens of alliance.\" Some nobles conspicuously absent from the reception. María is embarrassed and angry. Juan will need to work hard to salvage anything positive from this visit.\n\n11-25: Cool Politeness\nThe forms are observed, but warmth is lacking. The major nobles attend and say the right things, but there's a wariness behind the courtesies. Questions about the 700 knights—why so many for a family visit? Subtle probing about Castilian intentions. The Reconquista is acknowledged but not celebrated. The mood is diplomatic rather than fraternal. Juan is a foreign king, and they do not let him forget it.\n\n26-40: Correct but Reserved\nA proper reception befitting a visiting monarch and ally. Applause for the Reconquista, polite interest in Catalina, formal toasts to the alliance. But the Aragonese nobles hold something back—they are waiting to see what Juan wants before committing to enthusiasm. Conversations stay safe. No one offers anything beyond what protocol requires. Acceptable, but not the warm welcome of true allies.\n\n41-55: Respectful Welcome\nThe reception goes well. The nobles genuinely acknowledge the Reconquista as an achievement that honors all of Iberia, not just Castile. Catalina charms several older nobles. Questions about Constantinople show real interest. A few nobles mention relatives who fought alongside Castilians in earlier campaigns. The alliance feels functional and reasonably warm. Normal diplomatic success.\n\n56-70: Warm Reception\nGenuine enthusiasm. The Aragonese nobles are proud to host the Reconquista's hero—his glory reflects on all Christian Iberia. The story of \"La Princesita de la Cuerda\" has made Catalina a celebrity; nobles compete to be introduced to her. Multiple offers of hospitality, hunting invitations, requests to hear stories of Granada. The mood is festive. Several nobles express hope that their sons might train at Juan's military academy. The alliance feels like a true partnership.\n\n71-85: Enthusiastic Embrace\nThe Aragonese court treats Juan almost as one of their own. Speeches praising Castilian-Aragonese brotherhood. Nobles who remember Juan's visit four years ago remark on how he has grown into kingship. The Catalan merchants see opportunity rather than competition—proposals for joint ventures. Veterans of old campaigns against Granada weep openly when Juan enters. María is visibly moved by how warmly her brother is received. This is family, not just alliance.\n\n86-95: Triumphant Welcome\nJuan's arrival becomes a celebration of Iberian unity. The nobles stage an impromptu procession through Barcelona with Juan and María riding together. Church bells ring. Citizens line the streets. The Aragonese seem eager to share in Castile's reflected glory—\"we are all children of the Reconquista.\" Concrete offers emerge: ships for Constantinople, trade agreements, military cooperation. The three-kingdom dream suddenly feels tangible. Alfonso's regency council formally requests Juan's counsel on matters of state.\n\n96-100: Historic Moment\nSomething extraordinary occurs that transcends normal diplomacy. Possibilities: A powerful Catalan noble house that has historically opposed Castilian influence makes a dramatic public gesture of reconciliation; an elderly veteran who fought at Las Navas de Tolosa (1212) is brought forward to bless Juan as the fulfillment of two centuries of crusade; the merchants' guild proposes a formal Castilian-Aragonese trade union; María is moved to make a significant political gesture that strengthens both kingdoms. The visit becomes a turning point in Iberian relations that chroniclers will remember.\n\nReady to roll when you command, Your Majesty."

Both factions will try to draw Juan to their side. Juan asks to address the assembly before the factions can corner him. In his speech, he opens with humility about Catalan culture, frames the Reconquista as a shared Christian achievement, explains his 'kingdom of heaven' vision as glimpsing a better world in moments of grace, and asks only for prayers for both the Naples conclusion and Constantinople.

          "text": "A roll of 55—Respectful Welcome. The reception goes well, though the Aragonese nobles hold something back.\n\nThe great hall of the Palau Reial had been dressed for the occasion—Aragonese banners alternating with Castilian lions along the walls, fresh rushes on the floor scented with rosemary, and enough candles to make the winter afternoon bright as summer noon. The nobles of Aragon and Catalonia had assembled in their finest: velvets and brocades, gold chains of office, swords polished to mirrors.\n\nMaría sat on the regent's throne—not the king's seat, which remained conspicuously empty, but the smaller chair beside it. She wore a gown of deep crimson, the colors of both Castile and Aragon meeting in her person.\n\nJuan entered with Lucia on his arm, Catalina walking between them holding both their hands. The princess had been bribed into good behavior with promises of crostatas afterward, and she maintained an expression of solemn dignity that would have done credit to a child twice her age.\n\nThe herald's voice rang out: \"His Most Catholic Majesty Juan the Second, King of Castile and León, Conqueror of Granada! Her Majesty Queen Lucia of Castile! Her Royal Highness the Infanta Catalina!\"\n\nThe hall rose. The applause was genuine—not thunderous, but respectful, the measured acknowledgment of peers recognizing an achievement they could not diminish even if some wished to.\n\nThe Count of Urgell was the first of the great nobles to approach after the formal greetings. He was a man of fifty with a grey-streaked beard and the weathered face of someone who spent more time on horseback than in council chambers.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he said, bowing correctly. \"The Reconquista's completion honors all Christian Iberia. My grandfather spoke of the day when Granada would fall—he did not live to see it, but I drink to his memory tonight knowing his prayers were answered.\"\n\nIt was well said. It was also careful—Christian Iberia, not Castile. The count was acknowledging the achievement while claiming a share of it for all the peninsula's kingdoms.\n\nOthers followed. The Viscount of Cardona, whose trading ships competed with Castilian merchants in the Mediterranean, offered congratulations with a merchant's smooth smile. The Baron of Montcada, whose family had fought alongside Castilians in campaigns a generation past, was warmer—he clasped Juan's arm and spoke of shared blood spilled against the Moors. The Bishop of Barcelona blessed Juan in sonorous Latin and expressed hope that the crusading spirit would continue eastward.\n\nCatalina, meanwhile, had discovered that Aragonese nobles were just as susceptible to her imperious charm as Castilian ones. She allowed the Countess of Empúries to admire her traveling cloak (\"Is new. Old one saved boy.\") and graciously accepted a candied almond from the Baron of Cervera's wife.\n\n\"Your daughter has conquered more hearts in an hour than most diplomats manage in a year,\" murmured Don Ramon de Perellós, the head of María's regency council, as he stood beside Juan watching the proceedings. He was a lean man with clever eyes—a career administrator who had kept Aragon functional during Alfonso's long absences.\n\n\"The story from Fraga reached Barcelona before you did,\" he continued. \"The fishermen's guild has already commissioned a small icon of her for their chapel. They say she has the Virgin's own protection.\" A slight smile. \"It does not hurt that she is half-Portuguese, a quarter Castilian, and now beloved by Catalans. She belongs to everyone.\"\n\nHe paused, watching Lucia engage the Countess of Pallars in conversation—the queen's Italian grace making the Aragonese noblewoman laugh at something.\n\n\"Your queen is impressive,\" Don Ramon observed. \"Ferrara trains its women well. She knows exactly how much warmth to offer and how much to withhold.\"\n\nHis tone was approving but analytical—the assessment of a man who spent his life reading courts.\n\n\"May I speak frankly, Your Majesty?\"\n\nWhat does King Juan do?"

          "text": "Don Ramon inclined his head slightly, acknowledging the permission. He kept his voice low, pitched beneath the general hum of conversation in the hall.\n\n\"You are welcome here. Genuinely welcome. The Reconquista is a miracle that even the most jealous Catalan merchant cannot diminish, and your sister has governed well enough that no one can claim Castilian influence has harmed us.\"\n\nHe paused, choosing his next words with care.\n\n\"But you should understand what you are walking into. This court is... tired. Our king has been absent for years, chasing Naples. The treasury bleeds silver across the Mediterranean. The merchants pay taxes for a war that benefits Sicilian trade routes, not Catalan ones. The nobles send their sons to die in Italy for a crown that may never sit on Aragonese heads.\"\n\nDon Ramon gestured subtly toward a cluster of nobles near the wine—three men in expensive but slightly outdated fashions, their faces polite but closed.\n\n\"The Count of Pallars. The Viscount of Rocabertí. Don Berenguer de Bardají. They represent what you might call the 'Aragonese faction'—men who believe Alfonso's Italian obsession is destroying this kingdom. They do not oppose the Castilian alliance, but they wonder if it enables Alfonso's adventures rather than restraining them.\"\n\nHe turned slightly, indicating another group—younger men, better dressed, with the eager energy of those who hope to rise.\n\n\"And those are the 'Neapolitan faction.' Men who have tied their fortunes to Alfonso's success in Italy. They pray for Naples to fall so their investments pay off. They love Castile because Castilian gold and Castilian papal influence are bringing their dreams closer.\"\n\nDon Ramon's clever eyes met Juan's directly.\n\n\"Both factions are watching you, Your Majesty. The Aragonese faction wants to know: will you counsel Alfonso to abandon Naples and come home? The Neapolitan faction wants to know: will you commit even more to the Italian cause?\"\n\nHe smiled thinly.\n\n\"Her Majesty your sister walks between them every day. It is an exhausting dance. She has managed it for years because she is Alfonso's wife and your sister—she belongs to everyone and no one. But you...\"\n\nHe let the sentence hang.\n\n\"You are the most powerful king in Iberia. Your word carries weight that hers cannot. Whatever you say here, whatever position you seem to favor, will shift the balance. Both factions will try to draw you to their side tonight. I thought you should know the game before you are asked to play it.\"\n\nFrom across the hall, María caught Juan's eye and raised an eyebrow slightly—a sister's silent question: Is everything all right?\n\nDon Ramon stepped back, his duty discharged.\n\n\"I serve Aragon, Your Majesty. Not either faction. I tell you this because stable relations between our kingdoms serve Aragon—and stable relations require that you understand what you are dealing with.\"\n\nHe bowed.\n\n\"I believe the Count of Pallars is approaching. He will want to speak with you privately before the feast. And I suspect Don Guillem de Vic of the Neapolitan faction will find a way to interrupt within five minutes of the Count beginning.\"\n\nIndeed, the Count of Pallars was making his way across the hall—a heavyset man in his sixties with a face like weathered granite.\n\nWhat does King Juan do?"

A few words of thanks would be not only appropriate but expected.\" He paused, considering. \"Indeed, it might be wise. A public address allows you to set the tone before the factions can corner you individually.\"\n\nHe glanced toward María on the regent's throne.\n\n\"Her Majesty should introduce you—it reinforces that you speak as her guest, not as a king claiming precedence in another's court. A subtle distinction, but the Catalans will notice.\"\n\nDon Ramon's eyes swept the hall, calculating.\n\n\"The Count of Pallars is nearly here. If you wish to address the assembly, I would suggest doing so now—before he reaches you. Once private conversations begin, calling for general attention becomes awkward.\"\n\nHe stepped back and raised his hand in a small gesture. A servant materialized at his elbow.\n\n\"Inform Her Majesty the regent that His Majesty of Castile wishes to address the assembled nobles briefly, with her permission and introduction.\"\n\nThe servant slipped away through the crowd. María, across the hall, received the whispered message. Her eyes found Juan's, and she gave a small nod—then rose from her chair.\n\nThe hall began to quiet. Nobles turned toward the regent's throne. The Count of Pallars, caught mid-approach, stopped and waited with the rest.\n\n\"My lords and ladies,\" María's voice carried clearly through the hall. \"My brother, His Majesty King Juan of Castile, wishes to address you. As regent of Aragon in my husband's absence, I bid you attend him.\"\n\nShe gestured toward Juan, then sat—ceding the floor while retaining her position of authority.\n\nThe hall fell silent. Several hundred faces turned toward the King of Castile. Catalina, still holding a half-eaten candied almond, looked up at her father with evident interest. Lucia moved quietly to stand beside María, the two queens presenting a unified image.\n\nThe Aragonese faction watched. The Neapolitan faction watched. Don Ramon faded into the background, his expression carefully neutral.\n\nWhat does King Juan say?"

And thank you all for recieving me, my queen Lucia and my little Catalina as well. And I must begin with an apology. As a Castillian king, I know my own language and the many similarities my kingdom shares with Aragon. But I know far too little about Catalan culture. An offence I intend to mend. I am sure not only the queen and I are interested, but Catalina will want to sample what delicacies the Catalan kitchen will have to offer. She has never been to Italy but she sure loves crostatas.\n\n\nThe completion of the reconquista is indeed not my accomplishment alone. For centuries, christian kingdoms have worked together to drive islam further and further to the sea. We have now given them the final push and we know that this is the result of christian kingdoms fighting together. Fighting together in defence of christianity.\n\n\nI pause for a moment and look up to the heavens before continuing.\n\n\nLet me share something with you. I know that rumours have spread about me having visions of God. I do not, but let me tell you what I mean when I say that I sometimes glimpse a piece of heaven.\n\n\nWe live in an imperfect world. Men and women suffer. We face injustice. Good deeds are sometimes long and far between. We live in a world where christian kingdoms fight one another for greed, pride, women, prestige...hate.\n\n\nBut there is another world as well. A world where a child recieves the love of it's mother and the care of it's father. Where the innocents are protected. A world where God's peace reigns. A just and fair society. A world where christians fight and stand together.\n\n\nAnd it is so precious. It is small, fleeting. Blink and it is gone. But I have sometimes seen it. I saw it during the victory at Alcala la Real. I felt it when I met the pope. I experienced it when Catalina was born. And in those moments, we all wish we could live forever.\n\n\nI pace around the room.\n\n\nWhen I knelt before the pope, I did not ask for crusade to fight aghainst the Moors. I pledged myseld eternally to fight. To fight for a better, more just and good world. The kingdom of heaven, even if we may never reach it in this world. But in our struggle, in our fight, we discover who we are. I discover who I am.\n\n\nYou know who I am and why I am here. I am here to fight the Ottomans. If you want to help, pray I find the kingdom of heaven again in this new struggle. For in it lies not only victory, also salvation. With Castille and Aragon working together, the struggle for Naples will finally be won. I have recieves encouraging news from my brother-in law that the war will soon be over. Pray that it does so we can bring the kingdom of heaven closer to us.\n\n\nDraft a d100 table to see how this speech is recieved."

The theological content seems self-important to Catalan ears—who is this Castilian to lecture them about the kingdom of heaven? The humility about Catalan culture rings hollow when followed by a sermon. The Aragonese faction is openly disappointed he didn't counsel restraint on Naples. The Neapolitan faction wanted substance, not prayers. Polite applause, but the mood is cooler than before he spoke. Don Ramon winces slightly. María looks concerned.\n\n11-25: Lukewarm Response\nMixed reception. Some nobles appreciate the humility and the shared-credit framing of the Reconquista. Others find the speech too long, too abstract, too... Castilian. The factions are unsatisfied—he gave neither what they wanted. Applause is adequate but not enthusiastic. The speech changed nothing; the nobles remain in their initial \"respectful but reserved\" posture. Juan has neither gained nor lost ground.\n\n26-40: Polite Appreciation\nThe speech is received respectfully. The humility lands well—Catalans appreciate a king who admits ignorance and promises to learn. The Catalina touches draw smiles. The theological content is... tolerated. Neither faction is satisfied, but neither is offended. The applause is genuine if not thunderous. The mood remains at \"respectful welcome\"—the speech maintained the status quo without shifting it.\n\n41-55: Solid Reception\nThe speech works. The opening humility disarms skeptics. The shared-credit Reconquista framing is noted and appreciated—several nobles nod visibly. The \"kingdom of heaven\" rhetoric resonates with the pious contingent, and even the cynics appreciate that he asked for prayers, not gold. The factions are not fully satisfied, but they're not hostile. Warm applause. The mood shifts slightly upward—Juan has made a good impression.\n\n56-70: Well Received\nThe speech succeeds. The Catalan merchants appreciate the respect shown their culture. The theological content, delivered with evident sincerity, moves several older nobles. The shared framing of the Reconquista generates genuine warmth—\"he sees us as partners, not subordinates.\" The Catalina references make people smile. Even the unsatisfied factions acknowledge he navigated their competing demands gracefully. Strong applause. Several nobles approach afterward with warmer demeanors than before.\n\n71-85: Strongly Received\nThe speech resonates deeply. Juan's humility—a conquering king admitting ignorance and promising to learn—strikes Catalans as genuine and impressive. The \"kingdom of heaven\" rhetoric, rather than seeming grandiose, comes across as the authentic faith of a man who has seen miracles and struggles to understand them. The shared-credit Reconquista framing generates real emotion—veterans of old campaigns wipe their eyes. The factions set aside their disappointment, moved by something larger. Enthusiastic applause. The mood in the hall shifts notably warmer.\n\n86-95: Powerful Impact\nThe speech transforms the atmosphere. Juan's combination of humility, sincerity, and vision cuts through factional calculations. When he speaks of glimpsing heaven—at Alcalá, at Catalina's birth—hardened nobles find themselves moved. The promise to learn Catalan culture is received as genuine honor. The shared Reconquista framing makes them feel part of something greater than their petty disputes. Even the cynics are impressed by a king who asks only for prayers. Sustained applause, some calling out blessings. The factional tensions temporarily dissolve in shared emotion.\n\n96-100: Transcendent Moment\nSomething extraordinary happens. Perhaps an elderly noble who fought in ancient campaigns rises to embrace Juan as a brother. Perhaps the Bishop of Barcelona calls for an impromptu blessing. Perhaps Catalina does something that perfectly punctuates the moment. The hall is transformed—faction lines blur, old grievances are set aside, and for a shining moment the assembled nobles glimpse the very \"kingdom of heaven\" Juan described. This speech will be remembered and quoted for years. The visit's entire character has changed.\n\nReady to roll when you command, Your Majesty."

Count Pallars (Aragonese faction) confronts Juan about whether Castilian gold enables Alfonso's Italian obsession, pressing for Juan to counsel withdrawal. Don Guillem de Vic (Neapolitan faction) interrupts, seeking concrete commitments of ships, gold, and troops. Juan threads the needle — showing Alfonso's encouraging letter to both men, affirming he wants the war to end quickly while offering to help Alfonso personally on his way to Constantinople. Roll 60 (Cautious Respect) for Pallars: He appreciates Juan acknowledging the cost in 'coin and sons' but remains skeptical. Roll 41 (Cautiously Optimistic) for Guillem: He sees opportunity but wants more concrete commitments. Juan then engages Guillem in increasingly personal conversation, pushing past diplomatic performance to ask if Guillem truly means his words about cooperation. Guillem's courtier mask cracks — he admits he has never tried for anything beyond profit. Juan asks simply: 'Will you try with me?' Roll 64 (Something Shifts): Guillem offers concrete help — introducing the Gualbes banking family connections — and asks Juan to hold him accountable. Juan then makes a bold public announcement, naming Guillem's commitment before the entire court and calling for others to try. Roll 73 (Inspiring Moment): The hall responds warmly. Maria publicly endorses the vision. The Gualbes patriarch pledges support. A 'third faction' of believers begins to emerge, though Count Pallars remains watchful.",

Now let me prepare the NPC analysis before writing the scene:\n\nNPC ANALYSIS BEFORE SCENE\n\nCOUNT OF PALLARS (Aragonese Faction Leader)\n\nWhat he wants: Alfonso to abandon Naples and come home. Wants to know if Juan will use his influence to make this happen. Sees Juan as potentially useful lever—if the great King of Castile told Alfonso to stop wasting Aragonese blood and gold in Italy, Alfonso might listen.\n\nWhat he won't say: That he's calculating whether Juan is an asset or a threat. That he suspects Juan's \"beautiful speech\" was deliberate fence-sitting. That he's testing whether Juan has any actual commitment to Aragonese interests or just wants help for his Constantinople adventure.\n\nHis agenda: Draw Juan into saying something critical of the Naples campaign. Get a private commitment. Use Juan's words as ammunition later.\n\nDON GUILLEM DE VIC (Neapolitan Faction)\n\nWhat he wants: More Castilian commitment to Naples. Ships, gold, troops, papal pressure—anything. He's invested everything in Alfonso's Italian dream. If Naples falls to Aragon, he becomes rich and powerful. If it fails, he's ruined.\n\nWhat he won't say: How desperate he is. How much he's already borrowed against future Italian profits. That he sees Juan's Constantinople expedition as competition for resources that should go to Naples.\n\nHis agenda: Interrupt the Count of Pallars before he poisons Juan against Naples. Get Juan to commit something concrete. Flatter him into generosity.\n\nTHE SCENE DYNAMICS\n\nCount of Pallars approaches first (per Don Ramon's prediction)\n\nDon Guillem will interrupt within minutes\n\nBoth want to claim Juan for their faction\n\nNeither will be satisfied with \"pray for Alfonso\"\n\nJuan's speech (roll 61) was well-received but gave neither faction what they wanted\n\nBoth are now probing for the real position\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nThe applause fades into the murmur of renewed conversation. Nobles turn to one another, commenting in low voices—you catch fragments: \"ben dit\"... \"el rei de Castella\"... \"la princesita\"... The mood is warmer than when you entered. Not effusive, but genuinely respectful.\n\nLucia catches your eye from beside María, gives a small nod of approval. Catalina, having finished her candied almond, is now examining the Countess of Empúries' pearl necklace with the focused intensity of a jeweler appraising merchandise.\n\nBefore you can take three steps, a weathered figure in slightly old-fashioned velvet intercepts you.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" The Count of Pallars—grey-streaked beard, sun-darkened skin, the bearing of a man who has spent more time in saddles than throne rooms. His bow is correct but brief. \"A moving address. The kingdom of heaven.\" His Castilian carries a thick Catalan accent. \"We simple soldiers rarely hear such... poetry.\"\n\nHe falls into step beside you, guiding you subtly toward the tall windows overlooking the harbor. His voice drops.\n\n\"I knew your father, you know. Met him at Caspe, during the Compromise. He understood Aragon. Understood that a kingdom needs its king present, not chasing dreams across the sea.\" His eyes fix on yours—hard, assessing. \"You speak of Christian kingdoms working together. Of fighting together. Fine words. But tell me—when you counsel your cuñado Alfonso, do you counsel him to fight here, where his kingdom needs him? Or do you encourage his... Italian enthusiasms?\"\n\nHe gestures toward the harbor, where merchant ships crowd the wharves. \"Every ship you see carries taxes that cross the sea to feed soldiers in Calabria. Every young man you passed in this hall has brothers, cousins, sons who may never return from Italy. We have bled for Naples for years.\" His jaw tightens. \"Some of us wonder if Castile's gold and Castile's pope made it easier for Alfonso to keep bleeding us.\"\n\nThe question hangs in the air, direct as a blade: Are you part of the problem, King of Castile?\n\nBefore you can respond, a younger voice cuts in—smooth, courtly, carrying just a hint of breathless urgency.\n\n\"My lord Count, surely you're not monopolizing our honored guest?\"\n\nDon Guillem de Vic appears at your other elbow—thirty-ish, dark hair oiled and gleaming, clothes that probably cost more than most knights earn in a year. His smile is warm, his bow elaborate.\n\n\"Your Majesty, what an honor. Your speech—\" He presses a hand to his heart. \"When you spoke of glimpsing heaven at your daughter's birth, I confess my eyes grew damp. And the crostatas!\" A delighted laugh. \"You will find our Catalan cuisine more than adequate to her Highness's refined palate, I assure you.\"\n\nHe shoots a glance at the Count—polite, but edged. \"I hope my lord of Pallars has not been burdening you with our domestic concerns. The Count is passionate about... economy. Understandable, of course. Not everyone has vision enough to see beyond the accounting books.\"\n\nHis attention returns to you, eager, almost hungry. \"The news from Naples is extraordinary, is it not? Louis of Anjou failing, the barons turning, your sister speaks of Alfonso expecting victory by summer. With Castile's continued friendship—\" The word lands with weight. \"—the three kingdoms united at last. Your father's blood ruling from Toledo to Syracuse. Surely that is a glimpse of heaven itself?\"\n\nThe Count of Pallars has gone very still, watching you with those hard campaigner's eyes.\n\nTwo men. Two factions. Two incompatible visions of what you should do.\n\nAnd both waiting to see which side the Conqueror of Granada will choose."

He's heard this before—the war will end soon, victory is near, just a little more patience. He takes Juan's response as polite brush-off, the kind of thing powerful men say when they don't want to commit. His reply is curt, barely polite. He excuses himself shortly after. Juan has made an enemy—or at least confirmed a skeptic.\n\n16-30: Cold Skepticism\nPallars reads the letter without expression. \"Encouraging news. We have had encouraging news before, Your Majesty.\" His tone is flat. He's not convinced, and he's not pretending to be. He thanks Juan for his time with formulaic courtesy and withdraws, leaving Don Guillem the field. Pallars will watch Juan's actions, not his words.\n\n31-45: Guarded Acknowledgment\nPallars studies the letter, nods slowly. \"If this is true, then perhaps the end is indeed near.\" But his eyes say I'll believe it when I see it. He appreciates that Juan acknowledged the cost—that's more than most Castilians bother with—but he's not satisfied. He withdraws with careful courtesy, neither ally nor enemy. Reserving judgment.\n\n46-60: Cautious Respect\nThe acknowledgment of \"coin and sons\" lands. Pallars didn't expect a Castilian king to validate Aragonese suffering. He reads the letter more carefully, asks a pointed question or two about Alfonso's position. Still skeptical, but willing to give Juan credit for understanding the stakes. Withdraws with genuine (if restrained) courtesy. Door left open for future conversation.\n\n61-75: Grudging Acceptance\nPallars finds himself unexpectedly... not hostile. Juan's response wasn't what he wanted, but it wasn't the dismissal he expected either. The letter is genuinely encouraging—the details about Louis of Anjou's illness, the barons turning. \"If what you say is true, Your Majesty, then I pray you are right.\" He means it. Still watching, still cautious, but the edge has softened. May seek private conversation later.\n\n76-85: Genuine Engagement\nSomething in Juan's manner—the directness, the acknowledgment of cost, the concrete evidence—breaks through Pallars' cynicism. He asks real questions about the letter, about Alfonso's strategy, about what \"every help\" means. For a moment, faction politics recede; he's a tired soldier hoping the war might actually end. Leaves with something approaching warmth. Will remember this conversation.\n\n86-95: Unexpected Connection\nPallars recognizes something in Juan—a king who actually listens, who doesn't pretend costs don't exist. The letter, combined with Juan's evident sincerity, shifts his calculus. \"Your father would have said much the same, I think.\" High praise from him. He may seek private audience later to speak more frankly. The Aragonese faction's hostility toward Castilian involvement may be softening.\n\n96-100: Breakthrough Moment\nPallars studies Juan for a long moment, then does something unexpected—laughs, short and rough. \"You are a careful man, Your Majesty. You give me sympathy for my complaints and then tell me you will help Alfonso continue his war.\" But there's respect in it—he appreciates the honesty of the maneuver. \"Very well. If you can truly end it—end it, not merely win another battle—then perhaps your 'help' is worth the cost.\" A real opening. Pallars may become an unlikely ally if Juan delivers.\n\nReady to roll for Count of Pallars, Your Majesty?"

How long?\n\nJuan sympathized with costs—is he secretly an Aragonese faction sympathizer?\n\nNeed to probe: what does \"every help\" actually mean?\n\nCan he get Juan to commit something concrete before he leaves Barcelona?\n\nHis emotional state:\n\nRelieved Juan didn't side with Pallars\n\nAnxious that Juan didn't side with him either\n\nThe letter is good news, but he's heard good news before\n\nDesperate to extract something tangible from this visit\n\nD100 TABLE: DON GUILLEM DE VIC'S RESPONSE\n\nSuccess Factors\n\nJuan confirmed he will help Alfonso personally\n\nThe letter shows genuine progress—validates Guillem's investments\n\nJuan framed the goal as ending war through victory, not withdrawal\n\nJuan's prestige and papal connections are assets to the cause\n\n\"Put the past behind us\" suggests unity, which favors the winning side\n\nFailure Factors\n\nJuan acknowledged costs—that's Aragonese faction framing\n\n\"Every help he may need\" is vague, not concrete\n\nConstantinople is clearly Juan's priority; Naples is a stop along the way\n\nJuan showed the letter to Pallars too—no private favor to Neapolitan faction\n\nJuan didn't dismiss or diminish Pallars' concerns\n\nNo new commitments of ships, gold, or troops\n\nD100 TABLE\n\n1-15: Barely Concealed Disappointment\nDon Guillem's smile freezes. He was hoping for an ally; he got a diplomat. Juan's sympathy for \"costs\" stings—that's surrender talk, that's Pallars' poison. His flattery becomes hollow, his questions probing and slightly aggressive. \"Every help\" means what, exactly? For how long? He pushes too hard, reveals his desperation. Leaves the conversation dissatisfied, may speak ill of Juan to other Neapolitan faction members. The Castilian is not with us.\n\n16-30: Polite but Probing\nDon Guillem keeps smiling, but his eyes sharpen. He heard Juan validate Pallars' complaints about costs. He needs to know where Juan really stands. His questions become pointed: What kind of help? How many ships? Will Juan stay in Naples until victory is assured? The flattery continues but feels mechanical. He's testing, measuring. Walks away uncertain whether Juan is an asset or merely... neutral.\n\n31-45: Cautiously Optimistic\nThe letter is genuinely good news—Don Guillem can work with this. But Juan's even-handedness bothers him. A real ally would have dismissed Pallars' whining. Still, \"help Alfonso in person\" is something. He praises Juan's wisdom, praises the letter, praises the pope's support. But underneath, he's calculating: how do I get more? May approach Juan again before he leaves Barcelona, with specific requests.\n\n46-60: Satisfied (For Now)\nDon Guillem decides to take the win. Juan is going to Naples, Juan is going to help, the letter shows victory is near. The sympathy for \"costs\" was probably just diplomatic noise—you have to say these things when Pallars is standing right there. His flattery becomes more genuine, his relief visible. \"With Your Majesty's support, how can we fail?\" But he'll be watching to see if Juan's \"help\" materializes into anything concrete.\n\n61-75: Genuine Enthusiasm\nThe letter, combined with Juan's personal commitment, genuinely excites Don Guillem. This is what he's been waiting for—the Conqueror of Granada, the Pope's champion, throwing his weight behind Alfonso. He asks eager questions about the voyage, about Juan's plans in Naples, about the papal support. For the first time in months, he feels like the gamble might pay off. Will seek Juan out again to discuss specifics—ships, timing, coordination.\n\n76-85: Strategic Engagement\nDon Guillem recognizes Juan as a serious player and adjusts accordingly. The even-handedness that bothered him now reads as political sophistication—of course Juan can't openly dismiss Pallars in public. What matters is action, and Juan is going to Naples. He shifts from flattery to substance: What does Alfonso need most? What can Aragon provide to support Juan's Constantinople expedition in return? Begins thinking in terms of alliance, not just patronage.\n\n86-95: Partnership Overture\nDon Guillem sees an opportunity larger than he expected. Juan isn't just helping Alfonso—Juan is building something. The three kingdoms, the papal alliance, Constantinople. This is the future of Christendom, and Don Guillem wants in. He makes a bold move: offers to coordinate Catalan merchant support for Juan's expedition, hints at connections in Italian banking houses, positions himself as a valuable ally for Juan's larger ambitions. The Neapolitan faction might become Juan's faction.\n\n96-100: Transformative Moment\nSomething clicks for Don Guillem. He's been thinking small—Naples, investments, personal profit. But Juan's speech, Juan's vision, the scope of what's happening... He finds himself genuinely moved. \"Your Majesty, I have spent years thinking of Naples as a prize to be won. You speak of it as a step toward something greater.\" He asks, with unexpected sincerity, how he can serve—not just profit. A potential true believer is born. Whether this lasts depends on Juan's actions, but for now, Don Guillem has glimpsed the kingdom of heaven too.\n\nReady to roll for Don Guillem de Vic, Your Majesty?"

His eyes move slowly—he reads Castilian well enough, but without hurry. Don Guillem cranes slightly, trying to read over his shoulder without appearing to.\n\nThe Count's expression doesn't change as he reads. When he finishes, he hands the letter back with a grunt.\n\n\"Louis of Anjou dying. The barons turning.\" He scratches his beard. \"If this is true, then perhaps the end is indeed near.\"\n\nBut those hard campaigner's eyes say something else: I have heard 'almost won' before, Your Majesty. I heard it two years ago. I heard it before Ponza.\n\n\"You acknowledge the cost,\" he says slowly, as if testing the words. \"That is... more than most Castilians trouble themselves with.\" A pause. He glances at Don Guillem, then back to you. \"I pray you are right about the swift conclusion. Aragon has bled enough for Italian dreams.\"\n\nHe gives a short bow—correct, neither warm nor cold. \"I will not monopolize your time further, Your Majesty. You have many admirers tonight.\"\n\nHe withdraws, but you notice he doesn't go far. He positions himself near a pillar where he can observe without participating. Watching. Reserving judgment. The door is not closed, but neither is it open.\n\nDon Guillem watches Pallars retreat with barely concealed satisfaction. He has the field now.\n\n\"You must forgive the Count,\" he says smoothly. \"He is a good man, but he sees only expenses, never investments. He cannot imagine what Naples will mean for Aragon.\" His hand describes an arc encompassing the harbor outside. \"Every ship out there—imagine them sailing to Naples, to Syracuse, carrying Catalan goods to Italian markets without Angevin tariffs strangling our trade.\"\n\nHe turns to you, smile bright but eyes calculating.\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of helping King Alfonso. This is welcome news—more than welcome.\" The smile flickers, just slightly. \"Though I confess I am curious what form this help might take. You travel to Constantinople with a fleet, with knights, with—\" He gestures vaguely. \"—considerable resources. A stop in Naples, certainly, but...\"\n\nHe lets the question hang delicately in the air.\n\nHow long a stop? How much help? Is Naples a priority or merely a waypoint?\n\n\"Forgive my directness,\" he adds, not sounding sorry at all. \"We who have invested in King Alfonso's success are naturally eager to understand how Castile's support... manifests. The Pope's blessing is invaluable, of course. Your presence, inspiring. But wars are won with ships and soldiers and—\" A self-deprecating laugh. \"—florins. The crude mathematics of conquest.\"\n\nHe's still smiling, still flattering, but underneath there's an edge of anxiety. He needs this to work. He needs Naples to fall. And he's not entirely sure you're as committed as your beautiful speech suggested.\n\n\"Will Your Majesty be staying long in Barcelona before sailing? Perhaps there might be opportunity to discuss... coordination. Between your expedition and King Alfonso's campaign. Ways we might support each other.\"\n\nThe offer sounds generous. But you hear what's underneath: What can I extract from you before you leave?"

Buy influence? Dominate Aragon?\n\nThis is an opening. Juan is practically asking for a way to give more.\n\nBut wait—why is Juan telling him this? Guillem is not Alfonso. He can't ask on Alfonso's behalf.\n\nIs Juan asking Guillem to... arrange something? To be a go-between?\n\nWhat Don Guillem wants:\n\nMore Castilian resources flowing to Naples (his investments depend on victory)\n\nTo position himself as valuable to Juan—a man with connections, influence\n\nTo extract a concrete commitment he can leverage with his faction\n\nWhat he won't say:\n\nThat he's desperately over-leveraged on Naples succeeding\n\nThat he sees an opportunity to make himself the intermediary between Juan and Alfonso\n\nThat he's already calculating how to take credit for any additional Castilian help\n\nThat he doesn't actually have the authority to request anything on Alfonso's behalf\n\nHis calculation:\n\nIf he can get Juan to commit more resources, and frame it as his doing, his status soars\n\nBut he can't openly ask on Alfonso's behalf—that would be presumptuous\n\nHe needs to find a way to make Juan offer while making it look like Guillem facilitated it\n\nThis is delicate. Juan is being careful. Guillem needs to be careful too.\n\nThe tension:\n\nJuan has opened a door but is waiting for someone to walk through it\n\nGuillem wants to walk through but doesn't have the standing to do so officially\n\nHe needs to either: (a) hint that he can arrange a proper request, (b) suggest someone else who can, or (c) try to get Juan to commit anyway and sort out the formalities later\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nDon Guillem's eyes widen almost imperceptibly at \"more than is being asked\" and \"in a different light.\" His smile doesn't waver, but something behind it sharpens. He recognizes an opportunity when he sees one.\n\nHe glances around—ensuring no one is within earshot—then leans in to match your proximity. When he speaks, his voice is lower, the courtly music stripped away.\n\n\"Your Majesty is... perceptive.\" He chooses the word carefully. \"There are those who might indeed misread generosity as something else. Ambition. Interference.\" A pause. \"Aragon has its pride.\"\n\nHis tongue wets his lips—a nervous gesture, quickly controlled.\n\n\"King Alfonso, of course, would never doubt your intentions. You are family.\" The word carries weight. \"But asking for help—especially from a king who has just conquered Granada while Alfonso spent three years besieging Gaeta—\" He spreads his hands. \"It is difficult for a proud man. Even when he needs it. Especially when he needs it.\"\n\nHe's watching your face now, reading you, trying to gauge how far he can push.\n\n\"If there were a way for such help to be... offered rather than requested. If it came through proper channels, with proper framing. As a gesture between brothers-in-law, blessed by Her Majesty the regent, perhaps even suggested by certain Aragonese voices rather than imposed by Castilian ones...\"\n\nHe trails off, letting the implication hang.\n\nI could be that voice. I could arrange this. I could make it look right.\n\nBut he doesn't say it directly. He's waiting to see if you'll pick up what he's laying down—and what you might offer in return for such... facilitation.\n\n\"Naturally,\" he adds, almost as an afterthought, \"those who helped arrange such cooperation would be well-positioned to ensure it was properly appreciated. On both sides of the border.\"\n\nThere it is. The price tag, delicately displayed.\n\nWhat's my cut, Your Majesty?"

A king's debt. To him. He can already imagine how that will play in certain circles.\n\n\"Your Majesty is too generous,\" he says, and for once the flattery sounds almost sincere. \"I will write to King Alfonso myself. Tonight. And I have... friends... in his court who can ensure the message reaches him properly framed. As a brother's love, not a rival's condescension.\"\n\nHe's practically glowing. This is better than he hoped.\n\nBut then Juan mentions trade. Granada. Ports. Silk.\n\nThe glow dims, just slightly. His smile remains fixed, but his eyes flicker — the briefest calculation, quickly masked.\n\n\"Trade cooperation,\" he repeats, as if tasting the words. \"Yes. Yes, of course. The possibilities are... considerable.\"\n\nHe gestures expansively toward the harbor, buying time to think.\n\n\"Your Majesty must understand, the Mediterranean is... complex. Barcelona has traded these waters for centuries. We have relationships, routes, agreements. The Genoese, the Venetians, the Pisans — everyone has their place, their arrangements.\" A delicate pause. \"Introducing new... participants... requires care. The established powers do not welcome disruption.\"\n\nHe's nodding along with his own words, reasonable, helpful, explaining the realities.\n\n\"Granada's silk, certainly, has potential. But silk is also produced in Lucca, in Valencia, in Almería under Genoese factors. The markets are established. The buyers have their suppliers.\" He spreads his hands — what can one do? \"To develop new production, new ports, new routes — this requires expertise. Capital. Connections that take generations to build.\"\n\nHis smile returns, warmer now that he's found his footing.\n\n\"But these are matters for after the war, no? First Naples. First Constantinople. The great deeds of Christendom.\" He leans in conspiratorially. \"And then, when peace reigns, when King Alfonso sits secure in Naples... then we can speak of trade. Of cooperation. Of how Catalan expertise might assist Castilian ambitions.\"\n\nMight assist. Not will assist. And carefully framed as Catalan expertise helping Castile — not equals cooperating, but Barcelona graciously sharing its knowledge with the newcomer.\n\n\"For now,\" he continues smoothly, \"let us focus on the matter at hand. Your aid to King Alfonso. This I can help with. This I will help with.\" He places a hand over his heart. \"You have my word.\"\n\nHe's steering hard back to Naples. Back to where he's comfortable. Back to the deal he's already won.\n\nThe trade question hangs in the air, acknowledged but unanswered. After the war. Someday. Perhaps."

His eyes dart to the side — an instinct, looking for escape routes, for someone to interrupt, for anything to break this moment. But no one comes.\n\nHe looks back at Juan. Something shifts in his face — frustration, perhaps, or embarrassment. The expression of a man caught performing and unsure how to stop.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks if I truly mean it.\" His voice is quieter now, stripped of its musical courtier's cadence. \"You are the first king to ask me that.\"\n\nHe lets out a breath — almost a laugh, but not quite.\n\n\"I am a practical man. That much is true. I have had to be practical. My family is not ancient. We do not have castles full of ancestors. We have trade. Contracts.

But it's close.\n\n\"As for whether I believe you are the king who can bring us together...\"\n\nHe pauses.

I believe you are the king sailing to Constantinople while other monarchs count their coins and guard their borders. I believe you are the king standing in this hall asking a Catalan merchant whether he means what he says, as if the answer matters to you.\"\n\nAnother pause. Longer.\n\n\"Whether that makes you the king who can unite Castile and Aragon?\" He shakes his head slowly. \"I do not know, Your Majesty. I do not know if any king can do that. There is too much history. Too much pride. Too many men like Count Pallars who remember every slight, every war, every insult from grandfathers long dead.\"\n\nHe meets Juan's eyes. For a moment, the courtier is gone entirely.\n\n\"But I think you might be the king who believes he can. And perhaps...\" He hesitates. \"Perhaps that is rarer. And worth more.\"\n\nThe hall continues around them — music, laughter, the clink of cups. But in this small space between two men, something has become unexpectedly quiet.\n\nGuillem blinks, as if surprised by his own words. The courtier's mask begins to reassemble itself, but slowly, imperfectly.\n\n\"Forgive me, Your Majesty. You asked for truth. I am... not accustomed to providing it.\""

          "text": "NPC ANALYSIS: DON GUILLEM'S RESPONSE\n\nWhat Juan just did:\n\nShowed vulnerability — admitted he's not certain of himself\n\nReframed the question from \"do you believe in me\" to \"will you try with me\"\n\nMade it a partnership invitation, not a demand for faith\n\nAsked for commitment to effort, not guarantee of success\n\nThis is disarming — kings don't usually admit uncertainty\n\nWhat Don Guillem is processing:\n\nJuan just admitted doubt. To him. A Catalan merchant-noble.\n\nThis is... not how kings talk\n\nHe's being invited into something — not as a flatterer, but as a participant\n\n\"Will you try\" is a concrete ask — much harder to deflect than abstract questions\n\nHe's already off-balance from the last exchange; now Juan is pressing deeper\n\nWhat Don Guillem wants:\n\nHe wanted the king's favor, the intermediary role, the debt\n\nHe got those things\n\nNow Juan is asking for something different — genuine commitment to a cause\n\nThis isn't transactional anymore. This is... what? Idealism? Brotherhood?\n\nHe doesn't know how to trade in this currency\n\nWhat he won't say:\n\nThat he's never been asked to try for anything larger than his own profit\n\nThat the question frightens him a little — it implies responsibility\n\nThat part of him wants to say yes and part of him is screaming to retreat to safe ground\n\nThat he doesn't know if he's capable of trying for something he can't measure in florins\n\nHis dilemma:\n\nIf he says yes, he's committing to... what exactly? A vision? An effort? A king's uncertain dream?\n\nIf he says no or deflects, he loses this strange, unexpected moment — and possibly Juan's real respect\n\nHe's been invited past the transactional into the personal\n\nHe has no script for this\n\nWhat might happen:\n\nGenuine internal conflict — visible on his face\n\nThe courtier wants to say the right thing; the man underneath doesn't know what that is\n\nPossible outcomes: cautious yes, honest uncertainty, or retreat to safety\n\nThis is a character-defining moment for Guillem — who is he really?\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nDon Guillem stares at Juan.\n\nThe hall's noise seems far away — the music, the murmured conversations, the clink of silver. Here, in this small space, a King of Castile has just admitted uncertainty to a man who sells wool futures and flatters nobles for access.\n\nGuillem's mouth works silently for a moment. The courtier in him reaches for a response — something graceful, something that commits to nothing while sounding like everything. But the words don't come. Juan's question has cut past the place where those words live.\n\nWill you try.\n\nHe looks down at his hands. Fine rings. Soft palms. The hands of a man who has never held a sword in battle, never risked anything that couldn't be recovered with a good contract and a better lawyer.\n\n\"I have spent my life,\" he says slowly, \"trying to win. Trying to be on the right side. The profitable side.\" He laughs — a short, uncomfortable sound. \"I do not know if I have ever tried for something I might fail at. Something that could not be measured in ledgers.\"\n\nHe looks up again. His face is strange — open in a way it hasn't been all evening. Uncertain. Young, almost, despite the grey at his temples.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am not a brave man. I am not a visionary. I am—\" He gestures at himself, the fine clothes, the careful grooming. \"I am this. A man who saw which way the wind was blowing and positioned himself accordingly.\"\n\nA long pause. The music swells and fades.\n\n\"But you ask if I will try.\" He swallows. \"I... do not know what that means. For a man like me. In practical terms.\"\n\nHe's not refusing. But he's not accepting either. He's standing at a threshold, looking through, genuinely unsure whether he can cross it.\n\n\"If you tell me to write to Alfonso advocating for more aid, I will do it. If you tell me to speak well of Castile among my faction, I will do it. These things I know how to do.\"\n\nHis voice drops.\n\n\"But trying — trying for kingdoms to come together, for old wounds to heal, for something larger...\" He shakes his head slowly. \"I do not know if I am that man, Your Majesty. I have never had to find out.\"\n\nHe meets Juan's eyes. There's something almost like a plea there.\n\n\"What would you have me do? Not the easy things. The things I already promised. What would trying look like, for someone like me?\"\n\nHe's asking Juan to show him. To make it concrete. To tell him what kind of man he would have to become.\n\nThe courtier has left the building entirely. What remains is a man in expensive clothes who has just realized he might be capable of more than he thought — and is terrified of finding out."

The moment was too much, too fast. He retreats to performance — says yes, says the right words, but it's the courtier speaking again. Juan will sense the falseness. Guillem will tell himself later that he meant it, but he didn't. The transaction is complete; the transformation never happened. He'll be useful but never trustworthy.\n\n11-25: Sincere but Fleeting\nGuillem means it in this moment. He truly does. His \"yes\" is genuine. But he's a man shaped by decades of calculation, and sincerity is a muscle he's never exercised. Within days, the old patterns reassert themselves. He'll help Juan because it's profitable, not because of this conversation. The moment was real but left no permanent mark.\n\n26-40: Cautious Commitment\nGuillem says yes, and mostly means it. But he hedges — \"I will try, Your Majesty, in my own way, as I am able.\" He's leaving himself room to define \"trying\" however is convenient. He felt something real, but he's not ready to let go of control. He'll be more helpful than a purely transactional ally, but he won't take risks for the vision. A partial conversion.\n\n41-55: Genuine but Uncertain\nGuillem surprises himself. The yes that comes out is real — he can hear it in his own voice. He doesn't know what it means yet, or what it will cost, but he's said it and meant it. He'll spend sleepless nights wondering what he's committed to. When tested, he might rise to it or might fail. A seed has been planted; whether it grows depends on what happens next.\n\n56-70: Something Shifts\nGuillem feels something unlock. Juan's words — about different skills, about trying together, about María's quiet work — resonate in a place he didn't know existed. His \"yes\" comes with something extra: a concrete offer, a specific thing he can do, a first step. He's not transformed, but he's turned toward something. He'll remember this conversation for years.\n\n71-85: Real Commitment\nThe courtier doesn't come back. Guillem looks at Juan and sees, perhaps for the first time in his life, someone worth following for reasons beyond profit. His yes is solemn, almost frightened by its own weight. He asks what Juan needs — genuinely asks, not as negotiation but as service. Something fundamental has cracked open. He may never be a saint, but he's no longer purely a merchant.\n\n86-95: Transformative Moment\nGuillem's voice breaks slightly when he answers. He's never been asked to be part of something larger than himself. He's never believed he could be. Juan's faith in him — not in his money or connections, but in him — breaks through walls built over a lifetime. \"Yes,\" he says, and the word carries weight he's never given it before. \"Yes, Your Majesty. I will try.\" A true believer is born. Not in Juan's divinity, but in his vision.\n\n96-100: A Man Remade\nSomething extraordinary happens. Maybe Guillem drops to one knee, overcome. Maybe he laughs — real laughter, the kind that comes from unexpected joy. Maybe tears come, embarrassing and unstoppable. Whatever the outward form, the inner reality is the same: Don Guillem de Vic, who has never believed in anything he couldn't count, has just found something worth believing in. He will speak of this moment for the rest of his life. He will try to live up to it, imperfectly but genuinely, for as long as he lives. Juan has made not just an ally but a disciple.\n\nReady to roll, Your Majesty?"

None of it seems to reach this small space between a king and a merchant who has forgotten, briefly, how to be a merchant.\n\n\"Different skills,\" Guillem repeats quietly. He's not looking at Juan anymore. He's looking at his hands—those soft, ringed hands that have signed contracts and counted profits and never held anything heavier than a quill. \"Each with a role in God's plan.\"\n\nHe laughs—a strange sound, more breath than voice. \"Your Majesty, I have never thought of myself as having a role in God's plan. I have thought of myself as having a role in my plan. In my family's plan. In the plan to become wealthy enough that no one could dismiss me.\"\n\nHe looks up. His eyes are bright—not with tears, not quite, but with something raw and unguarded.\n\n\"You ask if I will try.\" He swallows. \"I have a confession, Your Majesty. When I approached you tonight, I had a strategy. Flatter the Castilian king. Position myself as useful. Extract what advantages I could.\" A grimace, almost a smile. \"I am not proud of this. But it is what I do. What I have always done.\"\n\nHe straightens slightly. When he speaks again, his voice is steadier.\n\n\"But you did not... you did not treat me as someone to be managed. You asked me questions no one has ever asked. You showed me doubt—your doubt—as though I were someone worth confiding in. And now you tell me that my skills, the skills of a merchant, have value in bringing kingdoms together.\"\n\nHe shakes his head slowly, wonderingly.\n\n\"I do not know if I can be the man you are describing. The man who tries for something larger than profit. But...\"\n\nHe pauses. Something settles in his face—a decision being made.\n\n\"There is a Catalan banking family. The Gualbes. They have connections in Florence, in Genoa, in Venice. Old relationships, built over generations. If Castile and Aragon are to truly work together—in trade, in finance, in the movement of goods and gold—these connections would be valuable.\"\n\nHe meets Juan's eyes directly.\n\n\"I can introduce you. Or rather—I can begin building the groundwork. Quietly. Merchant to merchant. The kind of work that does not appear in treaties but makes treaties possible.\" A pause. \"It is a small thing. But it is something I can do. Something I know how to do.\"\n\nHe takes a breath.\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. I will try. In my own way, with my own skills, as you said. I do not know if I will succeed. I do not know if I am capable of being more than what I have been.\" His voice drops. \"But I would like to find out.\"\n\nThe courtier is still absent. What stands before Juan is something rarer: a man who has just offered not flattery, not service, but himself—uncertain, imperfect, genuinely trying.\n\n\"Will you... will you hold me to it?\" Guillem asks quietly. \"When I retreat into old habits—and I will, I know myself that well—will you remind me of this moment? Of what I said I would try to be?\"\n\nHe's asking for accountability. Asking Juan to not let him off the hook.\n\nIt might be the most honest thing he's ever said to anyone."

This could inspire others to join the vision—or it could poison what was authentic by making it look like manipulation.\n\nWhat different rolls mean:\n\nLow rolls: The court sees this as a Castilian king overstepping, claiming their nobles, playing politics\n\nMid rolls: Mixed reaction—some inspired, some suspicious, factions hardening\n\nHigh rolls: The genuine emotion of the moment translates publicly; people are moved\n\nVery high rolls: Juan's vision catches fire; others want to \"try\" too\n\nD100 TABLE: COURT REACTION TO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nSuccess Factors\n\nJuan's earlier speech was well-received (roll 61)\n\nCatalina's Fraga miracle has made royal family beloved\n\nGuillem's Neapolitan faction already supports Castilian cooperation\n\nPositive framing: \"family,\" \"noble goal,\" \"try together\"\n\nJuan's prestige as Reconquista hero\n\nSome genuinely want the conflict to end\n\nFailure Factors\n\nCatalan pride—foreign king making announcements in their hall\n\nLooks like Juan is claiming/recruiting Aragonese nobles\n\nAragonese faction sees confirmation of fears: Juan enables Naples war\n\nClass resentment—why is a merchant being elevated?\n\nMaría not consulted—regency protocol violated\n\nPrivate moment made public can feel like manipulation\n\nCount Pallars was cautiously neutral; this may push him hostile\n\nCreates visible target for those who oppose Castilian influence\n\nD100 TABLE\n\n1-10: Badly Misjudged\nThe hall goes quiet—but not the good kind of quiet. Juan sees faces closing, arms crossing, glances exchanged. A Castilian king just stood in their hall and announced he's recruited one of their nobles to his cause. The Aragonese faction sees exactly what they feared: Juan using gold and influence to buy Catalan loyalty. Even some Neapolitan faction members look uncomfortable—Guillem elevated above them? By a foreigner? The applause that comes is thin, scattered, polite only because refusing to clap would be an open insult. María's face is carefully neutral, which is worse than anger. Guillem looks like a man who just realized he's been painted with a target. Count Pallars turns and walks out of the hall.\n\n11-20: Cold Reception\nPolite applause, but the warmth from Juan's earlier speech has evaporated. The announcement feels like politics, not inspiration. Catalans clap because a king asked them to, not because they're moved. Several nobles study Guillem with new, calculating eyes—is he Juan's man now? Can he be trusted? The factions don't harden openly, but the temperature in the room has dropped. María applauds with the rest but catches Juan's eye with a look that says we need to talk. Guillem's moment of transformation now looks, to outside eyes, like a transaction. He feels it. The private truth has been overshadowed by the public performance.\n\n21-35: Mixed Response\nThe hall fractures visibly. The Neapolitan faction applauds with genuine enthusiasm—finally, Castile committing publicly! The Aragonese faction is stone-faced or offers only perfunctory acknowledgment. The neutral middle watches both sides, calculating. Guillem receives congratulations from his allies and cold shoulders from others. María applauds appropriately but her expression is unreadable. The announcement has clarified lines rather than transcended them. Some are inspired; others are alienated. Don Ramon, observing from the margins, looks thoughtful—this was bold, but was it wise?\n\n36-50: Cautious Acknowledgment\nThe applause is real but measured. Catalans appreciate the sentiment—\"family not enemies\" is hard to argue with—but they're reserving judgment. A few younger nobles look genuinely moved. The Aragonese faction applauds politely, faces revealing nothing. Count Pallars remains at his pillar, clapping slowly, watching. Guillem receives the attention with visible uncertainty—is this elevation or exposure? María nods graciously, playing the supportive sister, though Juan can't read what she's thinking. The announcement neither failed nor succeeded; it planted a seed whose growth remains uncertain.\n\n37-55: Respectful Reception\nThe applause is warm enough. Juan's framing—\"he will try, I will try\"—resonates with those tired of eternal conflict. Several nobles nod along. The Neapolitan faction is pleased; the Aragonese faction is not hostile, merely watchful. Guillem stands straighter, accepting the moment with something approaching dignity. A few people approach him afterward with what seem like genuine congratulations. María's applause is gracious, and when she catches Juan's eye, there's a small nod—not enthusiastic, but not disapproving. The court hasn't been transformed, but neither has it rejected the vision.\n\n56-70: Genuine Warmth\nSomething in Juan's delivery—the simplicity, the lack of political calculation in his voice—lands. The applause swells beyond politeness. Several nobles call out approval. An older man near Count Pallars raises his cup: \"To family, then!\" Others echo him. Guillem looks startled, then moved—this is real support, not just factional positioning. The Aragonese faction doesn't join the enthusiasm, but even Pallars gives a slow, thoughtful nod of acknowledgment. María's smile reaches her eyes. The Neapolitan faction is energized; the neutral middle has tilted slightly toward Juan's vision. The announcement didn't end factional divisions, but it created a third position: those willing to try.\n\n71-85: Inspiring Moment\nThe hall responds. Juan's words—about trying, about family, about each person's role—echo his earlier speech and amplify it. When the applause comes, it's robust, genuine. Nobles who hadn't planned to commit find themselves moved. Don Guillem receives not just acknowledgment but embraces from unexpected quarters. A Catalan merchant lord announces he'll support Guillem's efforts with his own connections. Someone calls for a toast to the kingdoms united. María rises from her seat and adds her voice: \"My brother speaks truth. Let us be family at last.\" Even Count Pallars, from his pillar, raises his cup—not enthusiastically, but without hostility. The factional lines blur, just slightly. Something is shifting.\n\n86-95: The Vision Takes Hold\nJuan has found the moment. The hall, already warmed by his earlier speech and the Catalina legend, catches fire. Nobles crowd around Guillem not as faction members but as volunteers—who else will try? What can they do? A grey-bearded knight who fought in Italian campaigns twenty years ago pushes through the crowd to grasp Juan's arm: \"I've waited my whole life to hear a king say this.\" María descends from the regent's seat to stand beside her brother, publicly endorsing the vision with her presence. Even the Aragonese faction seems uncertain—is opposing this now opposing peace itself? Count Pallars watches with an expression Juan can't quite read—not converted, but... considering. The night has turned into something no one expected.\n\n96-100: Transformative\nWhat happens next will be talked about for years. Perhaps the Bishop of Barcelona calls for an impromptu blessing on the vision of unity. Perhaps Count Pallars himself crosses the hall to take Guillem's hand—old warrior acknowledging that perhaps, perhaps, there is another way. Perhaps Catalina, watching from Lucia's arms, waves her small hand and calls out \"Try! Try!\" in her clear child's voice, and the hall erupts in laughter and tears together. Whatever the specific form, the substance is the same: Juan has done something rare. He has turned politics into meaning. Not everyone is converted—there will still be factions, still be resistance, still be old grudges. But tonight, in this hall, enough people glimpsed the kingdom of heaven that they'll never quite forget it. The journey has truly begun.\n\nReady to roll, Your Majesty?"

The musicians, sensing the moment, let their melody fade.\n\n\"Friends!\"\n\nJuan's voice carries—not shouting, but with the projection of a man accustomed to being heard over battlefields. The hall falls silent. Several hundred faces turn toward the King of Castile and the Catalan merchant standing beside him.\n\nDon Guillem's expression flickers through several emotions in rapid succession: surprise, alarm, and then something that might be terror. This was not what he expected when he asked to be held accountable.\n\nJuan speaks. The words ring out across the stone and tapestry: Guillem's choice. The kingdoms coming together. Writing to Alfonso. Gratitude. Noble goal. The court should help him. Try together. Family, not enemies.\n\nFor a heartbeat, nothing.\n\nThen the Neapolitan faction responds—enthusiastic applause, cups raised, voices calling approval. They understand what this means: Castile is publicly committed. Their investments are validated. Their man Guillem has been elevated by a conquering king.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there.\n\nFrom the center of the hall, an older merchant lord—one of the Gualbes, ironically, the very family Guillem had mentioned—pushes forward. His face is weathered by decades of Mediterranean trade, his clothes expensive but practical. He reaches Guillem and clasps his shoulder.\n\n\"I'll stand with you,\" he says, loud enough for those nearby to hear. \"My house's connections in Florence. If this is real—if we're actually trying—then the Gualbes will try too.\"\n\nThe ripple spreads. Another merchant, then a minor noble whose lands straddle the Castilian border, then a ship captain who's lost cousins to the Naples wars. Not a flood, but a stream. People moving toward Guillem, toward Juan, offering not just applause but themselves.\n\nSomeone calls for a toast. Cups rise throughout the hall. \"To family!\" an old voice cries—the same grey-bearded knight who fought Italian campaigns before most of these nobles were born. \"To family, damn it all! I'm tired of burying sons in foreign soil!\"\n\nThe cry echoes. \"To family!\"\n\nMaría rises from her seat.\n\nThe hall notices. The regent of Aragon, moving to stand beside her brother. She descends the two steps from the elevated platform, her crimson gown trailing, and takes her place at Juan's side. When she speaks, her voice is clear.\n\n\"My brother speaks truth.\" She looks out at the assembled court—her court, the one she has managed and balanced and held together for years. \"For too long, Castile and Aragon have circled each other like wary dogs. I have spent four years trying to build bridges while others built walls. Tonight, my brother offers his hand. I say we take it.\"\n\nShe turns to Juan, and for a moment the regent disappears. She's just his older sister, the one who helped him through impossible choices four years ago, looking at the man he's become.\n\n\"Let us be family at last,\" she says.\n\nThe applause swells. Not universal—Juan can see the Aragonese faction clapping politely, faces guarded, Count Pallars among them—but genuine from enough of the hall that the sound fills the space.\n\nGuillem stands in the center of it, looking like a man caught in a river's current. People are shaking his hand, clapping his back, making offers he'll have to remember tomorrow. The private moment of transformation has become terrifyingly public.\n\nBut when he catches Juan's eye across the chaos, there's something there that wasn't before. Not just gratitude. Not just fear.\n\nYou didn't let me retreat. You held me to it. In front of everyone.\n\nA small nod. Almost imperceptible.\n\nI asked you to. And you did.\n\nNear the pillar, Count Pallars watches. His cup is raised—not enthusiastically, but raised. His expression is unreadable. He hasn't joined the stream of nobles approaching Juan, but he hasn't walked out either.\n\nDon Ramon de Perellós catches Juan's eye from across the hall. The administrator's face carries something like respect—and something like warning.\n\nBold move, Your Majesty. Very bold. Now you'll have to deliver.\n\nThe night continues. More wine flows. Conversations multiply. The factions haven't disappeared—they've just been complicated. The Neapolitan faction is energized, believing their moment has come. The Aragonese faction is quieter, watching, calculating what this means for their position. And in the middle, a new group has emerged: those who heard Juan's words about trying, about family, and found themselves wanting to believe.\n\nWhether that belief survives the morning remains to be seen.\n\nBut tonight, in this hall, something shifted.\n\nCatalina, watching from Lucia's arms near the edge of the crowd, tugs at her mother's sleeve.\n\n\"Papa made friends?\" she asks.\n\nLucia looks at the swirling chaos of nobles, the raised cups, the complicated web of hope and calculation and old grievance that her husband has just stirred into motion.\n\n\"Yes, piccola,\" she says carefully. \"Papa is trying to make friends.\"\n\nCatalina considers this with the gravity of a twenty-month-old philosopher.\n\n\"Good,\" she pronounces. \"Friends are good.\"\n\nShe returns her attention to the far more important matter of whether she can convince someone to bring her another candied almond."

Perhaps Catalina, exhausted and overstimulated, has a tantrum that can't be contained. Perhaps Juan, pressed by a skeptical Aragonese lord, says something that sounds like Castilian condescension. Perhaps a drunk noble makes an insult that can't be ignored. The warm mood from the announcement dissipates. By evening's end, the goodwill has evaporated. People remember the awkwardness more than the inspiration. The \"third faction\" of believers quietly disperses, embarrassed. Tomorrow, the cynics will say they knew it couldn't last.\n\n11-20: Diminishing Returns\nThe evening drags. Juan repeats his themes too often; what sounded inspiring once sounds rehearsed the fifth time. Lucia performs adequately but fails to sparkle. Catalina grows fussy and must be taken to bed early, denying Juan his most effective ambassador. The conversations become repetitive, the wine leads to rambling, and by the end people are tired rather than inspired. The announcement's impact fades into \"a nice moment\" rather than a turning point. Nothing lost, but nothing gained beyond what was already won.\n\n12-30: Mixed Results\nThe evening has highs and lows. Some conversations go well—a border lord is genuinely moved, a merchant makes concrete offers. Others fall flat—an Aragonese matriarch remains icily polite, a young noble clearly approaches only to say he met the famous king. Catalina charms some and annoys others (she refuses to perform on demand). Lucia handles a difficult conversation gracefully but another catches her off-guard. By evening's end, Juan has made some personal connections but also some personal disappointments. The announcement's impact holds but doesn't grow.\n\n31-45: Steady Progress\nJuan and Lucia work the evening competently. They meet dozens of nobles, remember names, make appropriate comments. Catalina is generally adorable, with only minor fussy moments. No dramatic breakthroughs, but no failures either. The \"third faction\" believers remain enthusiastic; some fence-sitters tip positive. The Aragonese faction stays reserved but isn't actively hostile. Count Pallars eventually approaches for a brief, correct exchange—nothing warm, but not cold either. A solid diplomatic evening. The foundation holds.\n\n46-60: Good Impressions\nThe royal family performs well. Lucia's Italian sophistication impresses Catalans who trade with Genoa and Venice—she speaks knowledgeably about Mediterranean commerce. Catalina distributes her charm strategically (with some maternal guidance). Juan's consistency in message reassures those wondering if the announcement was genuine or calculated. Several meaningful conversations occur: a shipbuilder offers vessels for Constantinople, a vintner proposes Castilian-Catalan trade exchange, an elderly dowager countess tells Juan he reminds her of her late husband \"who also believed impossible things.\" The evening reinforces rather than undermines the announcement's impact.\n\n61-75: Memorable Night\nSomething clicks. The combination of Juan's sincerity, Lucia's grace, and Catalina's irresistible presence creates a cumulative effect. People approach skeptical and leave thoughtful. The Gualbes patriarch has a long conversation with Lucia about Ferrarese banking practices. A young knight from the Aragonese faction breaks ranks to tell Juan privately that he's tired of his elders' bitterness. Catalina, presented with a small carved horse by an admiring craftsman, solemnly names it \"Friend\" and the story spreads through the hall. Even Count Pallars, when he finally approaches, offers something beyond mere courtesy: \"You've given us much to think about, Your Majesty.\" María catches Juan's eye across the room and smiles—a real smile, not a diplomatic one. This night will be remembered.\n\n76-85: Exceptional Evening\nThe evening becomes something more than diplomacy. Juan finds himself in genuine conversations—about faith, about family, about what kingdoms owe each other. Lucia discovers a shared love of poetry with the Countess of Urgell and they spend an hour discussing Italian verse. Catalina falls asleep in the arms of a gruff Aragonese admiral who fought at Ponza—the man's weathered face softens in a way that makes his wife weep quietly. The factions begin to blur; people are just people tonight. Count Pallars seeks Juan out for a real conversation, asking hard questions but listening to the answers. When the evening finally ends, dozens of nobles have made personal commitments—not political calculations, but genuine choices to try. María embraces Juan before he retires: \"I don't know what you've started, little brother. But I think it might be real.\"\n\n86-95: Transformative\nThe evening takes on a life of its own. What began as a reception becomes something approaching a movement. Nobles who came skeptical find themselves converted not by argument but by atmosphere—the sincerity is contagious. Stories multiply: the Castilian king who listened to a minor baron's concerns for twenty minutes; the little princess who comforted a homesick page; the Italian queen who spoke Catalan phrases she'd clearly practiced just for tonight. Count Pallars doesn't just approach—he and Juan talk for nearly an hour, and by the end something has thawed. The old warrior doesn't become a believer, but he stops being an opponent. When the evening ends, Juan has not just made allies but planted seeds of genuine transformation. The \"third faction\" isn't a faction anymore—it's becoming a consensus. Don Ramon, watching, shakes his head in wonder: \"I've served three regencies. I've never seen anything like this.\"\n\n96-100: Legend\nYears later, people will claim they were there the night the kingdoms began to heal. The evening transcends politics entirely. Perhaps the Bishop leads an impromptu prayer for unity that moves the hall to tears. Perhaps Count Pallars and Don Guillem—Aragonese and Neapolitan factions—clasp hands publicly in reconciliation. Perhaps Catalina does something so perfectly timed and innocent that it becomes the story everyone tells: the moment the child of Castile and Portugal and Este brought Aragon's warring nobles together with a single gesture. Whatever happens, whoever witnesses it, one thing is certain: Juan came to Barcelona to pass through on his way to Constantinople. He leaves having changed the political landscape of Iberia. María will write to Alfonso that night: \"Our brother is not the boy we remember. He is something else now. Something I do not have a word for. Come home when you can, husband. You should meet him.\"\n\nReady to roll for the evening, Your Majesty?"

          "text": "THE EVENING DIMS\n\nThe first hour goes well enough. Nobles approach, Juan receives them, Lucia smiles graciously, Catalina waves her small hand at admirers. The momentum from the announcement carries them through the initial rush of well-wishers.\n\nBut the evening is long, and Barcelona's nobles are many.\n\nBy the second hour, Juan notices Catalina growing restless. She squirms in Lucia's arms, refuses a candied almond (unprecedented), and when the Viscount of Cardona's wife attempts to compliment her cloak, Catalina buries her face in Lucia's shoulder and will not look at the woman.\n\n\"She is tired, caro,\" Lucia murmurs between visitors. \"It has been a very long day for little legs and little eyes.\"\n\nDonna Francesca hovers nearby, ready to take the princess to bed, but each time they prepare to leave, another noble approaches and it seems rude to withdraw.\n\nThe third time Juan explains his vision of cooperation to a politely skeptical merchant, he hears his own words growing stale. The phrases that rang with power during the announcement—family not enemies, each with a role, all we can do is try—begin to feel rehearsed. He sees it in the merchant's eyes: Yes, yes, very inspiring, but what does this actually mean for tariffs on Valencian cloth?\n\nLucia handles a conversation with the Countess of Pallars—the Count's wife—with her usual grace, but Juan catches the moment when the Countess asks about Portuguese trade connections and Lucia hesitates, uncertain whether the question is genuine interest or a probe for weakness. The conversation ends politely but coolly.\n\nCatalina's patience finally breaks during an encounter with a well-meaning but tone-deaf baron who insists on telling her about his own grandchildren at length. She lets out a wail that cuts through the hall's murmur, loud enough to turn heads.\n\n\"No! No more talking! Catalina done!\"\n\nLucia's cheeks flush. She makes apologetic sounds while Donna Francesca swoops in to extract the screaming princess. The baron laughs it off—\"Children, yes, yes\"—but Juan sees other faces in the crowd. Smirks. Raised eyebrows. The legend of the miraculous child of Fraga suddenly looks more like an ordinary toddler who stayed up past her bedtime.\n\nThe departure is awkward—Catalina's cries echo as she's carried toward the family chambers, and conversations pause throughout the hall to watch.\n\nWithout Catalina, the dynamic shifts. Lucia soldiers on admirably, but she's tired too—the pregnancy, the journey, the long day. Her responses become shorter, her smile more fixed. A Catalan merchant's wife makes a comment about Italian women and their \"delicate constitutions\" that might be innocent or might be pointed; Lucia cannot tell and responds with coolness that may have given offense.\n\nJuan finds himself in a conversation with three Aragonese faction lords who arrived together—clearly coordinated. Their questions are probing:\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of cooperation, but what of the Infantes' claims? Do you consider those matters... settled?\"\n\n\"The Military Orders now answer to Castile's crown, we hear. How does this cooperation extend to institutions that once served all Iberian kingdoms?\"\n\n\"Your expedition to Constantinople is noble, certainly. But some wonder if Castilian ambitions might grow to... encompass other directions as well. The Mediterranean, perhaps. Aragon's waters.\"\n\nThe questions are not hostile, exactly. But they are tests. And Juan is tired, and the phrases that came easily an hour ago now require effort to summon.\n\nAcross the hall, Juan catches sight of Count Pallars in conversation with Don Ramon de Perellós. Both men glance toward Juan, then away. Their expressions are unreadable.\n\nThe \"third faction\" of believers from the announcement has dispersed into the general crowd. Some still look warmly toward Juan when he catches their eyes. Others have drifted back to their usual companions, their usual conversations. The moment of unity is fragmenting back into ordinary politics.\n\nDon Guillem de Vic is still being congratulated by his allies, but Juan notices he looks overwhelmed rather than triumphant. The merchant who bared his soul an hour ago is now surrounded by people who want things from him—connections, commitments, explanations of what exactly he promised the Castilian king. His transformation has become a transaction again.\n\nMaría appears at Juan's elbow during a brief gap between conversations.\n\n\"You should retire soon,\" she says quietly. Her voice is neutral—sisterly concern or political advice, impossible to tell. \"The evening has been... eventful. Better to end while the memory of your announcement is still warm. Another hour of small talk will not improve on it.\"\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\"The Countess of Pallars told me Lucia seemed unwell. Perhaps the journey, perhaps the child she carries. It would be... understood if the Queen of Castile needed rest.\"\n\nHer eyes meet Juan's. There's something there—not criticism, exactly, but an observation. A note that the evening's magic is fading and a wise king knows when to leave the stage.\n\n\"I can make your excuses if you wish. Or you can press on. You know this court better than you did this morning.\"\n\nShe waits for his decision."

Lucia raises deep concerns about Juan's belief that God gives him endless strength and will not let him die. She tells stories of crusaders who marched into deserts certain faith would sustain them, and asks Juan to promise to speak with his confessor Fray Hernando about whether his certainty might be the sin of presumption. Juan responds with a theological explanation of his faith rather than addressing her fear, comparing her possible death in childbirth to his in battle. Lucia becomes hurt and withdrawn — 'You did not answer me. I asked you to promise to speak with your confessor. You explained to me instead why you do not need to.' She points out that he told her not to be frightened rather than sitting with her fear. The conversation ends with emotional distance between them. The next morning, Catalina wakes demanding crostatas. Juan fetches drinks from the kitchen himself. When Lucia observes the sour aftertaste of the night, she articulates clearly: 'Sometimes when I bring you a fear, I am not bringing you a problem to solve. I am bringing you a piece of myself.'",

No one will think less of you for it. They'll remember the announcement, not the departure.\"\n\nShe touches Juan's arm briefly—a sisterly gesture, private amid the crowd.\n\n\"We'll talk tomorrow. There is much to discuss.\" A pause. \"You did well tonight, Juan. Better than you know. But Barcelona is not won in an evening.\"\n\nShe turns to address the hall, her voice carrying the practiced authority of four years' regency.\n\n\"My lords and ladies, Their Majesties of Castile must retire. The journey from Toledo has been long, and the Queen requires rest.\" A gracious smile. \"But they have asked me to accept invitations on their behalf. His Majesty wishes to know you all better and hear your concerns. There will be time.\"\n\nPolite applause. Understanding murmurs. A few disappointed faces among those who hadn't yet managed to approach, but nothing hostile.\n\nTHE PRIVATE CHAMBERS\n\nThe rooms María has prepared for them are comfortable—not ostentatious, but warm. A fire crackles in the hearth. Catalan tapestries depicting hunting scenes line the walls. Through the window, the distant harbor glimmers with reflected moonlight.\n\nCatalina is already asleep when they reach her, tear-tracks still visible on her round cheeks, clutching the wooden horse someone gave her earlier. Donna Francesca has done her work well—the princess is clean, changed, peaceful.\n\n\"She fought sleep for an hour,\" the nursemaid whispers. \"Kept asking for Papa. And for crostatas.\"\n\nLucia lifts the sleeping child gently, and they carry her to the great bed in the royal chamber. Catalina stirs, murmurs something unintelligible, then settles between them as they lie down.\n\nFor a moment, there is only quiet. The distant sounds of the reception continuing below. The fire's crackle. Catalina's soft breathing.\n\nLucia turns her head on the pillow to look at Juan. In the firelight, the exhaustion shows clearly on her face—but something else too. She watched him tonight. Watched him move through that hall, make that announcement, reach for something larger than politics.\n\n\"Caro,\" she says softly, one hand resting on the small swell of her belly, the other on Catalina's back. \"What you said to that man. Don Guillem. About trying. About each person having a role.\"\n\nShe pauses, choosing her words.\n\n\"You meant it. Truly meant it. I could see it in his face when he understood that you meant it.\"\n\nHer dark eyes search his face in the dim light.\n\n\"I have watched my father's court my whole life. I have never seen a king speak to a merchant that way. Ask him to try. Ask him to be more than he thought he was.\"\n\nShe is quiet for a moment.\n\n\"Who taught you to do that?\""

That a wise ruler tends it—prunes here, waters there, waits for things to grow in their season.\" Her thumb traces across his knuckles. \"Patient. Careful. Never forcing.\"\n\nShe looks at him, something wondering in her expression.\n\n\"But you do not tend. You forge. You put the metal in the fire and strike it until it becomes what you see in your mind.\" A pause. \"It is terrifying to watch, caro. And beautiful. And I do not know if it will work.\"\n\nCatalina stirs between them, mumbles \"crostata\" in her sleep, and settles again.\n\nLucia's voice drops lower.\n\n\"The Reconquista. The pope. The Military Orders. Now Aragon. Constantinople next.\" She shakes her head slowly. \"How many hammers can one man swing before his arms give out?\"\n\nThe question hangs in the dark air of the chamber. Not accusation—genuine wondering. The concern of a wife who has watched her husband take on the weight of Christendom and does not know when it will become too much.\n\nOutside, the Barcelona night continues. Below, the reception winds toward its end. Somewhere in the harbor, ships creak at anchor—including the ones that will carry Juan east toward Constantinople and whatever waits there.\n\nBut here, in this room, there is only firelight, and a sleeping child, and a woman waiting to hear what her husband believes he can carry."

The distant sounds of the reception have faded now—Barcelona settling into sleep.\n\nLucia does not respond immediately. Her dark eyes study Juan's face in the flickering light, and there is something in her expression that was not there before. Not fear, exactly. Not doubt. Something more complex.\n\nShe has seen her husband speak of God before. She has heard him describe his vision of the kingdom of heaven—at their wedding, in private moments, in his address tonight. She believes he is sincere. She believes he is good.\n\nBut this is different.\n\nAs long as I walk in God's glory, I will never tire.\n\nShe is a daughter of Ferrara.

Her hand remains on his chest, over his heart, but it has gone still.\n\n\"You did not answer me,\" she says finally.\n\nHer voice is calm. Too calm, perhaps. The voice of a woman who has learned to control her emotions in a court full of watchers.\n\n\"I asked you to promise to speak with your confessor. About the strength you feel. About what it means.\" She pauses. \"You explained to me instead why you do not need to.\"\n\nShe withdraws her hand from his chest. Not sharply—slowly, deliberately. She settles back onto her pillow, looking up at the shadowed ceiling rather than at him.\n\n\"Juan. I am not a child who needs theology explained to her. I am not a nervous courtier who needs reassurance. I am your wife. I am carrying your heir.\"\n\nHer voice remains level, but there is something beneath it now. An edge.\n\n\"I told you I was frightened. I asked you for one thing. A promise to speak with Fray Hernando. Not to doubt yourself. Not to abandon your purpose. Just to... let someone else look at what is happening inside you. Someone who knows the difference between holy purpose and...\"\n\nShe stops. Breathes.\n\n\"And you told me that God will not let you die. That I should place my faith in you.\"\n\nCatalina shifts between them, murmurs something, settles again. Lucia waits until the child is still before continuing.\n\n\"My father said those words to my mother once. Before he rode to a battle he was certain God had ordained.\" Her voice is very quiet now. \"He came back. But not every man does. And the ones who do not—their wives are left with nothing but 'place your faith in me' and an empty bed.\"\n\nShe turns her head to look at him. Her eyes are bright—not with tears, not quite, but with something held carefully in check.\n\n\"I am not asking you to doubt God. I am asking you to remember that you are a man. That even holy men have confessors for a reason. That the sin of presumption is real, and it does not announce itself—it feels like certainty.\"\n\nShe holds his gaze.\n\n\"Will you speak with Fray Hernando? Yes or no. Not because I doubt you. Because I love you. And because I need to know that someone is watching.\"\n\nThe question hangs between them. Simple. Direct. Requiring an answer, not an explanation."

If I approach him because someone else told me to, I would not be seeking out confession because I wanted to but to please others. What you talk about has been discussed with Hernando many times. And let me be as clear as possible.\n\n\nI could be sitting comfortably in Toledo right now. Ignore the plight of the Greeks. Let nobles shower me with gifts and flattery. Let Alvaro and other advisors run the kingdom. Try and make the best choices for the kingdom, sure. Be a just and rightful king, easy when you never leave the capital. Maybe once make a large donation to a crusade or found a church and feel like you contribute. That is how most men live their lives. I pusj myself to do the maximum possible to make the world better. I call it the kingdom of heaven, but it really means a better world.\n\n\nThinking about this, makes me happy. Knowing that I am working on making the world better. Theologically, I would say that I am divinely inspired and Hernando agrees that this is the case. But that does not mean that I will not go thirsty in the desert. I will just like anyone. SO you could say that God sets me to task, but he does not chop the wood for me. That I have to do myself. God does not protect me in battle. Me being careful and a good armour does. Speak to anyone who was with me in the battles. I do participate in charges and lead from the front, but I am never reckless. I accept danger, sure, but never without reason.\n\n\nI could die in battle, you could die in childbirth. The things we can not change are in God's hands. I will surround you with the best care when delivering and will love and support you as best I can. But the rest is in the hands of God. And then I say: place your trust in him. We cannot worry about the things we cannot control.\n\n\nWhen I next seek out confession, I will discuss with Hernando if presumption is being kept at bay. ANd I value your council love. I really do. I do not always act the way you would want me to, but I do always want to hear from you.\n\n\nI give her a kiss."

But there is something missing—a warmth that was there before, now held in reserve.\n\nWhen he pulls back, her eyes are closed. She does not open them immediately.\n\n\"Thank you for explaining,\" she says quietly.\n\nThe words are polite. The tone is not cold, exactly. But it is... careful. The voice of a wife who has heard her husband's answer and is choosing not to fight anymore tonight.\n\nShe turns slightly, settling deeper into the pillow. One hand finds Catalina's small back, resting there protectively.\n\n\"I am very tired, caro. The child takes much from me these days.\"\n\nIt is true. It is also a door closing.\n\nShe does not say you did not hear me. She does not say you compared my possible death to yours as if they were the same thing. She does not say I asked for one promise and received a lecture.\n\nShe does not say I am frightened for you in a way I was not before this conversation.\n\nShe says only: \"We should sleep. Tomorrow will be long.\"\n\nHer breathing slows. Her eyes remain closed. Whether she is actually falling asleep or simply ending the conversation, Juan cannot tell.\n\nCatalina murmurs between them, dreaming of crostatas or horses or the big water she saw today.\n\nThe fire crackles low in the hearth.\n\nOutside, Barcelona sleeps. The harbor waits. Constantinople waits. The hammers of the kingdom of heaven wait to be swung again.\n\nBut here, in this bed, something small and quiet has shifted. A wife asked her husband for something. He explained why he would not give it. And now she is turned away, eyes closed, one hand on her daughter's back.\n\nTomorrow will be long.\n\nThe night settles around them, and Juan is left with the silence."

Lucia explains the difference between solving problems and sharing burdens: 'I am not a weight to be carried. I am not a kingdom to be managed. I am your wife.' She teaches him the bridge metaphor — marriage is two people building from opposite banks, hoping to meet in the middle. Juan finally understands, admitting he has been trying to be 'worthy' of Lucia by swinging a bigger hammer when what she needed was his presence. He apologizes genuinely, laughing at himself. Lucia is deeply moved, telling him she did not marry him for his hammer but for the man who asked what she thought. They reconcile with a real kiss. Before leaving the chambers, Juan pulls Lucia aside for one more private moment, acknowledging that 'maybe not all things can be made beautiful while swinging a hammer.' Lucia asks him to tell her tonight how the day felt, not what he accomplished. They agree to face the day as a team.",

Catalina has colonized the center of the bed, building a fortress from pillows while narrating her construction in a mixture of Castilian and invented words.\n\nLucia is awake, sitting up against the headboard, watching their daughter's engineering efforts.

But there's a hint of warmth now, fragile but present. \"You are as bad as your daughter.\"\n\nAs if summoned, Catalina looks up from her demolished crostata, face smeared with crumbs and fruit.\n\n\"Papa bad?\" she asks, deeply interested in this development.\n\nLucia's composure breaks, just slightly. The corner of her mouth twitches.\n\n\"No, piccola. Papa is not bad.\" She glances at Juan. \"Papa is... trying.\"\n\nThe word hangs there — an echo of last night's theme, but gentler now. An acknowledgment that trying is not nothing, even when it falls short.\n\nShe squeezes Juan's hand once, then releases it.\n\n\"Yes,\" she says. \"A crostata would be welcome. And then we should dress. Your sister will want to speak with you, I think. And I should...\"\n\nShe pauses, something passing across her face.\n\n\"I should write to my mother. It has been too long.\"\n\nShe does not say what she will write. But something in her tone suggests it will be more than pleasantries."

The morning light catches the side of her face, illuminating the faint shadows under her eyes — evidence of a night that held more wakefulness than sleep.\n\nShe does not rush to fill the silence.\n\n\"A team,\" she repeats softly, as if testing the weight of the word.\n\nHer hand comes up, almost unconsciously, to rest on his chest — not over his heart this time, but lower, over the ribs. A different kind of touch. Grounding rather than searching.\n\n\"In Ferrara,\" she says slowly, \"my mother once told me that marriage is not two people walking the same road. It is two people building a bridge while standing on opposite banks. You work from your side, I work from mine, and if we are fortunate — if we are careful — we meet in the middle.\"\n\nShe looks up at him.\n\n\"You are very good at building things, Juan. Kingdoms. Alliances. Visions of heaven.\" A small, careful smile. \"But a bridge requires knowing where the other person stands. Not assuming. Knowing. And that means...\"\n\nShe pauses, choosing her words.\n\n\"That means sometimes setting down the hammer. And asking.\"\n\nHer hand presses slightly against his ribs.\n\n\"You asked me this morning what I felt you should discuss with Hernando. That was a question. A real one.\" She holds his gaze. \"Last night, you did not ask. You told. Do you see the difference?\"\n\nIt's not accusation. It's instruction — offered gently, between equals.\n\n\"I do not need you to be less than you are, caro. I do not want a smaller husband. But I need to know that when I speak, you hear me. Not a problem to be solved. Not a fear to be explained away. Me.\"\n\nShe rises slightly on her toes and kisses his cheek — soft, lingering.\n\n\"Today, we will be a team,\" she says quietly. \"And tonight, you will tell me how it felt.

When I know I am not carrying it alone.\"\n\nShe tilts her head slightly, studying his face.\n\n\"You are so strong, Juan. You carry so much. But I am not a weight to be carried. I am not a kingdom to be managed. I am your wife. And sometimes what I need is not your strength but your presence.

Her hand flies to her neck, touching the spot where his lips were.\n\n\"Juan!\" she protests, but she's smiling. \"I just said I need to look like a queen, and now—\"\n\nShe catches sight of herself in the polished metal mirror, sees the flush creeping up her throat, and shakes her head in mock exasperation.\n\n\"Impossible man.\"\n\nBut she's still smiling as her lady-in-waiting returns to finish the lacing and pinning. And when she catches Juan's eye in the mirror, there's something there that wasn't present yesterday—a warmth rekindled, fragile but real.\n\nTHE PALAU REIAL - LATE MORNING\n\nThe corridors of Barcelona's royal palace are busier now—servants carrying linens, officials clutching documents, nobles lingering in alcoves hoping to catch the eye of someone important. Word has clearly spread about last night's announcement; Juan notices more bows than strictly necessary, more lingering glances, more whispered conversations that pause as he passes.\n\nCatalina walks between her parents, one hand in Juan's, one in Lucia's, taking three steps for every one of theirs. She has been bribed into good behavior with promises of seeing \"Tía María\" and possibly more pastries. Her wooden horse \"Friend\" is tucked under one arm; \"Rope\" the horse apparently remains in the chambers, guarding the pillows.\n\nMaría's private solar is in the eastern wing, overlooking the harbor. Two guards in Aragonese colors flank the door. They bow as the royal family approaches.\n\n\"Her Majesty the Regent is expecting you, Your Majesties.\"\n\nThe door opens.\n\nMaría's solar is warm with morning light, the windows thrown open to let in the salt breeze from the Mediterranean. Maps are spread across a heavy table—Italy, the western Mediterranean, shipping routes marked in colored inks. A half-eaten breakfast sits forgotten on a side table.\n\nMaría herself stands by the window, watching something in the harbor below. She's dressed more simply than last night—a deep blue gown, her dark hair braided and coiled, practical rather than ceremonial. She looks tired, Juan realizes. The kind of tired that doesn't come from one sleepless night but from years of carrying weight.\n\nShe turns as they enter, and her face shifts through several expressions in quick succession—the regent's mask, then the sister beneath it, then something more complex as her eyes move from Juan to Lucia to Catalina.\n\n\"Tía!\" Catalina announces, releasing her parents' hands and trotting forward with the confidence of a child who has never met a room she couldn't conquer.\n\nMaría's face softens. She crouches down, heedless of her gown, and opens her arms.\n\n\"There she is. The little rope-thrower of Fraga.\" She catches Catalina in an embrace, lifting her easily. \"Did you sleep well, pequeña? I heard you were very tired last night.\"\n\n\"Catalina had crostata,\" the princess reports solemnly. \"Two crostatas. And Papa was bad but not really bad.\"\n\nMaría raises an eyebrow over Catalina's shoulder, glancing at Juan with the particular expression of an older sister who has just been handed ammunition.\n\n\"Is that so?\" she murmurs. \"Papa was bad?\"\n\nShe sets Catalina down, producing a small painted wooden bird from somewhere—clearly prepared in advance. \"Why don't you show this to your mother by the window, pequeña? I need to speak with Papa for a moment. About his badness.\"\n\nCatalina accepts this trade eagerly, trotting to Lucia with her new treasure. Lucia, reading the room, guides the child toward the harbor view, pointing out ships and seabirds, giving Juan and María space.\n\nMaría straightens, smoothing her gown. Her eyes meet Juan's.\n\n\"You look better than I expected,\" she says quietly. \"I thought you might have a longer night, after that announcement.\" A pause. \"It was bold, Juan. Very bold. Don Ramon spent an hour after you left trying to calculate what it means for the factions.\"\n\nShe gestures to a pair of chairs near the cold fireplace.\n\n\"Sit. We have much to discuss, and I suspect we won't have long before the nobles start requesting audiences.\"\n\nShe waits until he's seated before taking her own chair, arranging herself with the practiced economy of a woman who has spent four years conducting state business from rooms like this one.\n\n\"So,\" she says. \"Constantinople. Naples. Don Guillem de Vic. The speech about the kingdom of heaven.\" Her eyes—their father's eyes, Juan realizes, the same dark intensity—hold his.\n\n\"Tell me what you're actually trying to do, little brother. Not the version for the court. The truth.\""

Her fingers tap once, twice, against the arm of her chair.\n\n\"That is a lovely sentiment, Juan,\" she says finally.

I asked what you're actually trying to do. And you've given me... this.\" She gestures vaguely. \"Unity. Family. Taking care of me. The Trastámara conflict.\"\n\nHer eyes sharpen.\n\n\"I've spent four years in this chair, little brother. Four years balancing factions while our husband chases Naples. Four years explaining to Catalan merchants why their taxes feed Italian wars. Four years smiling at nobles who wonder why the regent's womb remains empty while the king is never home.\"\n\nHer voice doesn't rise, but something in it hardens.\n\n\"I do not need to be taken care of. I have been taking care of myself, and Aragon, and Alfonso's dreams, while you conquered Granada and charmed the Pope.\"\n\nShe lets that sit for a moment. Then, more quietly:\n\n\"I am not angry with you, Juan. I am proud of what you've accomplished. Genuinely. But do not come into my solar and offer me family warmth when I asked for truth.\"\n\nShe leans forward.\n\n\"So. Again. What are you actually trying to do? Not the vision. Not the kingdom of heaven. The plan. Constantinople — what do you expect to achieve there? Naples — how much more are you prepared to give Alfonso? Don Guillem — what did you actually promise him last night? And this talk of unity...\"\n\nHer voice drops.\n\n\"Does 'uniting the family' mean something specific? Are you proposing a formal alliance? A treaty? A marriage for Catalina when she's of age? Are you asking for Aragonese ships, Aragonese gold, Aragonese blood for your Eastern crusade?\"\n\nShe spreads her hands.\n\n\"Tell me what you want, Juan.

A dowager queen in her brother's unified kingdom?\n\nHer four years of holding Aragon together would culminate in handing it to Castile\n\nHer entire political relevance depends on being Alfonso's wife and regent; this plan diminishes both\n\nWhat María is calculating:\n\nIs Juan asking her to advocate for this with Alfonso?\n\nDoes Juan understand what he's asking of her personally?\n\nHas he considered that she might still bear children?\n\nDoes he see her as a person in this plan, or an instrument?\n\nWhat happens to her in this \"unified kingdom\"?\n\nWhat she won't say (yet):\n\nThat this feels like a betrayal dressed as family unity\n\nThat he's asking her to work against her own potential children\n\nThat she's spent four years serving Aragon only to give it away\n\nThat she's furious and hurt and trying not to show it\n\nThat she wonders if the \"family warmth\" was just softening her up for this\n\nHer emotional state:\n\nShocked (even if she suspected something, hearing it is different)\n\nHurt (he didn't consider her position)\n\nAngry (carefully controlled)\n\nPolitically calculating (what does she do with this information?)\n\nLonely (her brother sees her as a means to an end)\n\nHer likely response:\n\nCold. Measured. The regent, not the sister.\n\nShe will not explode — she's too practiced for that\n\nShe will ask pointed questions that expose what he hasn't considered\n\nShe may make him uncomfortable by naming what he's asking of her specifically\n\nShe will not agree or disagree yet — she needs to understand more\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nThe room goes very still.\n\nMaría does not move. Her face does not change. But something behind her eyes shifts — a door closing, or perhaps a wall going up.\n\nThe silence stretches. Outside, seabirds cry. Catalina's voice drifts from the window, chattering to Lucia about the painted bird. The sounds feel very far away.\n\nWhen María speaks, her voice is perfectly level.\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nTwo words. Flat. Giving nothing.\n\nShe rises from her chair — slowly, deliberately — and walks to the table with the maps. Her back is to Juan. Her fingers trace the coastline of Aragon, then Castile, then the Mediterranean beyond.\n\n\"You want my husband to name you his heir,\" she says to the maps. \"You want, when Alfonso dies, for his kingdom to become yours. For Aragon to become Castile. For the crown I have spent four years protecting to pass to my brother.\"\n\nShe turns. Her face is composed, but her eyes are hard.\n\n\"Tell me, Juan. In this plan of yours — this unity — what happens to me?\"\n\nShe takes a step toward him.\n\n\"If I bear Alfonso a son next year, does your claim supersede his birthright? Do you expect me to advocate for my brother over my own child?\"\n\nAnother step.\n\n\"And if I never bear a child — if Alfonso dies and I am a widow — what then? Do I retire to a convent? Take a small estate somewhere and fade into obscurity? Become the sister who handed Aragon to Castile and is taken care of for her trouble?\"\n\nHer voice remains steady, but there is ice in it now.\n\n\"You asked me to bear the hard truth in mind, Juan. So bear this in mind: you have just told your sister that her husband's kingdom should pass to you. That her years of service were prologue to your inheritance. That unity means Aragon absorbed into Castile.\"\n\nShe stops, an arm's length away. Close enough that he can see the fine lines of exhaustion around her eyes, the grey threads in her dark hair that weren't there four years ago.\n\n\"Did you consider, even for a moment, what you were asking of me? Not of Alfonso. Not of Aragon. Of María?\"\n\nShe waits. The question hangs between them like a blade."

I understand but let me explain and correct a few assumptions you have made.\n\n\nShould the two crowns ever unite, IF that ever were to happen, that kingdom would not be called Castille, nor would it be called Aragon. To name it after one of the two would presume dominance of one over the other. What I seek is union. For the two kingdoms to become something else where not one is subordinate to the other, but rather a union where both benefit and stand stronger together.\n\n\nAs it stands and your husband passes today, I have a strong claim on the crown of Aragon already. What I mean by naming me heir means just making my claim official and preventing a bloody war of succession. It will in no way supercede the claim of any futiure children you may have. I ask for clarification of the current situation. Who will be king of Aragon when Alfonso dies?\n\n\nAnd finally, I would not put you away in an estate somewhere. Whatever happens and should I ever hold Aragon, I would love to have you hold court in Barcelona like you do now. You are a great regent and putting you away would do injustice to your talent should you wish to continue to hold this role.\n\n\nBut family cuts both ways sister.

María sees through the reframing — \"a new kingdom\" is still Aragon ceasing to exist. She's furious that he planned this without consulting her or Alfonso. Her response is icy: she will not advocate for this with her husband, she will not facilitate Aragon's absorption, and she questions whether Juan truly sees her as family or as a useful instrument. The conversation ends badly. The warm relationship from yesterday is damaged, possibly severely. She may write to Alfonso with her own account of this conversation.\n\n16-30: Hurt Withdrawal\nMaría is wounded more than angry. She thanks Juan for his honesty but makes clear she cannot support this. The assurances about her future role feel like payment for betraying Aragon. She needs time to think. She will not commit to anything. The meeting ends with formal courtesy but genuine distance. She's reconsidering everything about Juan's visit — was the announcement last night about unity, or about preparing the ground for this?\n\n31-45: Guarded Skepticism\nThe clarifications help, but don't resolve María's concerns. She asks pointed questions: Does Alfonso know? What happens legally if she has children after Juan is named heir? Who decides what \"a new kingdom\" looks like — Castilian Cortes or Aragonese Corts? She's not rejecting the idea outright, but she's not accepting it either. She needs concrete answers, not visions. She suggests Juan discuss this with Alfonso directly rather than asking her to advocate for it.\n\n46-60: Cautious Consideration\nMaría's anger cools somewhat. She acknowledges Juan addressed her concerns. She's still not convinced, but she's willing to listen further. She raises practical issues: the Cortes would never accept this; the Catalans would revolt; the Aragonese faction already suspects Castilian ambitions. She asks what Juan expects her to do, specifically. Is he asking her to advocate with Alfonso? To prepare the Aragonese nobles? She needs to understand her role before she can consider agreeing to anything.\n\n61-75: Reluctant Engagement\nSomething in Juan's response reaches her — perhaps the genuine offer to support future children, perhaps the acknowledgment of her value. She's still skeptical, but she's no longer defensive. She admits the succession question is real — Alfonso has no heir, and uncertainty is dangerous. She asks more questions, but they're genuine inquiries rather than challenges. She may be willing to discuss this with Alfonso, but makes no promises. The door is open, but barely.\n\n76-85: Genuine Dialogue\nMaría decides to take Juan at his word. She's still not convinced this plan is right, but she's willing to engage with it seriously. She shares her own thoughts: what would a true union look like? What protections would Aragon need? What role would she play? The conversation shifts from confrontation to collaboration — two siblings trying to solve a genuine problem. She may not advocate for Juan's specific proposal, but she's now a partner in thinking through the challenge rather than an obstacle.\n\n86-95: Sisterly Alliance\nThe combination of Juan's honesty, his specific assurances, and his acknowledgment of her value breaks through María's defenses. She admits she's been carrying this fear alone — the uncertainty of Alfonso's succession, her own precarious position. Juan is the first person to address it directly. She doesn't agree to everything, but she commits to being Juan's ally in this conversation with Alfonso. She wants to be part of shaping the solution, not just accepting one. A genuine partnership begins to form.\n\n96-100: Full Trust\nSomething extraordinary happens. María sees her brother clearly — not as a rival or a threat, but as family trying to protect everyone, including her. She shares things she's never told anyone: her fears about Alfonso, her exhaustion, her loneliness. The conversation becomes deeply personal. She not only agrees to support the conversation with Alfonso, but offers her own ideas for how to make the union work. The siblings who haven't truly talked in four years find each other again. Whatever challenges remain, they'll face them together.\n\nReady to roll, Your Majesty?"

She turns away, walking back to the window, her back to him. The morning light catches the grey threads in her hair, the slight stoop in her shoulders that wasn't there four years ago.\n\nSilence stretches between them. At the window, Lucia glances over, sensing the tension. She quietly guides Catalina further away, pointing at ships in the harbor, her voice a soft murmur of distraction.\n\nWhen María finally speaks, her voice is quiet. Controlled. But there's something beneath it — a hairline fracture in the composure.\n\n\"A new kingdom. Not Castile, not Aragon. Something else.\" She doesn't turn around. \"And I would continue as regent. Hold court in Barcelona. Under you.\"\n\nShe lets the last two words hang in the air.\n\n\"You have thought about this carefully, Juan. I can see that. You have answers prepared for my objections. You have reassurances for my fears.\" A pause. \"You have even promised to support children I do not have and may never have.\"\n\nShe turns now. Her eyes are dry, but there's a brightness to them that speaks of tears held back by sheer will.\n\n\"But here is what I notice, brother. You came to Barcelona with this plan already formed. You gave your speech about unity last night. You recruited Don Guillem to your cause. You charmed the court with your daughter and your beautiful queen and your talk of the kingdom of heaven.\"\n\nHer voice hardens slightly.\n\n\"And only now — the morning after — do you tell your sister what you actually want. After the ground has been prepared. After the factions have been stirred. After you have positioned yourself as the great unifier.\"\n\nShe takes a step toward him.\n\n\"Did it occur to you to tell me first? Before the speeches? Before the announcements? To ask my counsel before you began reshaping the political landscape of my regency?\"\n\nShe stops, arms crossed over her chest — a protective gesture.\n\n\"You say family cuts both ways, Juan. But you did not treat me as family. You treated me as... an audience. Someone to be brought along after the decisions were made. Someone to be managed with reassurances and promises.\"\n\nHer voice drops, and for a moment the regent disappears. What remains is a tired woman, hurt in ways she's trying not to show.\n\n\"I have spent four years holding this kingdom together. Four years writing letters to a husband who sends back battle reports and requests for money. Four years smiling at nobles who wonder why the queen cannot produce an heir. Four years being strong because someone had to be.\"\n\nShe looks at him — really looks, the way she used to when they were children and she was the older sister who knew things.\n\n\"And you walk in with your conquests and your visions and your plans for union, and you offer me... what? A continued role. In your kingdom. Under your crown. As your regent.\"\n\nShe shakes her head slowly.\n\n\"I am not saying no, Juan. I am saying I cannot say yes. Not like this. Not this morning, with your ships in the harbor and your knights eating our food and your merchants making deals with our merchants.\"\n\nShe moves to her chair and sits heavily — not the graceful descent of a queen, but the collapse of an exhausted woman.\n\n\"I need time. I need to think. I need to write to Alfonso and hear what he wants, not what you want me to tell him he should want.\"\n\nShe looks up at him.\n\n\"You asked for truth, so here is mine: I love you, Juan. You are my brother. But right now, I do not trust you. You have handled this badly, and I am hurt, and I do not know how to feel about any of it.\"\n\nA long pause.\n\n\"Go. Receive your nobles. Accept your invitations. Play the great king.\" Her voice is flat now, drained. \"We will speak again before you sail. Perhaps by then I will know what to say.\"\n\nShe looks away, toward the window, toward the harbor, toward the sea that separates her from a husband she barely sees and a future she cannot predict.\n\nThe audience is over."

Roll 82 (Frank Discussion, Mutual Interest): The bishop, after initial probing, speaks frankly about three concerns keeping Aragonese churchmen awake: (1) fear that Juan's control of the Military Orders will extend to other Church institutions, (2) worry that Castilian influence will override Barcelona's traditional right to elect its own bishops, and (3) anxiety that pro-Basel reform clergy will be punished for supporting the Council against Pope Eugenius. Juan takes an unexpected approach — he brings his entire satchel of diplomatic documents to the bishop's desk and shows him everything: the Declaration of Como co-signed with Emperor Sigismund, the letter to Pope Eugenius proposing parallel legislation, the Castilian delegation's Basel instructions supporting chapter elections and reforms. When the stunned bishop asks what Juan wants in return, Juan answers simply that he wants the Church to bless marriages, teach the gospel, hear confessions, and feed the poor. Roll 76 (Spiritual Recognition): The bishop is profoundly moved, confessing that forty years of church politics made him forget why he became a priest. He promises to write to other Aragonese bishops affirming Juan's support for reform, to advocate for the Constantinople expedition, and to be an ally for any future unity efforts. He offers Juan a genuine blessing and agrees to say Mass at the Cathedral of Santa Eulalia the next morning.",

The Bishop of Barcelona wishes to offer his formal blessing upon Your Majesty's expedition to Constantinople and discuss certain ecclesiastical matters.\"\n\nHe glances up briefly, then back to the parchment.\n\n\"Midday: A reception meal with representatives of the Consell de Cent—the city council of Barcelona—and leading members of the merchant guilds.

I know something of holding a position that depends entirely on a man's choices.\"\n\nHer dark eyes meet his.\n\n\"I will not defend you, caro. You are right that this would only make things worse.

In the end, Juan and Lucia descend to the bishop's audience in complementary velvets of deep burgundy trimmed with gold, the lions of Castile and the Este eagle subtly echoed in their embroidery. They look, as intended, like a unified front. A partnership made visible in silk and thread.\n\nThe servant leads them through the Palau Reial's corridors to a reception chamber overlooking the cathedral square. Through the tall windows, the spires of Barcelona's great cathedral rise against the winter sky—construction still ongoing after nearly a century, scaffolding clinging to the unfinished façade like wooden vines.\n\nTHE BISHOP OF BARCELONA\n\nFrancesc Climent Sapera rises as they enter. He is perhaps sixty, with the soft hands of a man who has never worked and the sharp eyes of one who has spent decades navigating church politics. His robes are fine but not ostentatious—purple silk beneath a white rochet, a golden pectoral cross resting against his chest. His face is carefully arranged in an expression of benevolent welcome.\n\n\"Your Majesties.\" He bows—correctly, the precise depth owed to a foreign sovereign and his consort in a territory where he is a guest. \"You honor me with your presence. And together, no less—a vision of Christian matrimony that warms an old churchman's heart.\"\n\nHis eyes flicker briefly to Lucia—assessing, cataloguing—before returning to Juan.\n\n\"Please, sit. I have taken the liberty of having wine brought, and some small refreshments. The morning is cold, and you have traveled far.\"\n\nHe gestures to chairs arranged near the window, a small table between them bearing cups, a flagon, and a plate of neules—thin Catalan wafer biscuits rolled into delicate cylinders.\n\nOnce they are seated, the bishop settles across from them, arranging his robes with practiced grace.\n\n\"I wished to offer my blessing upon your expedition to Constantinople, Your Majesty. A noble undertaking—the defense of Christendom's eastern bulwark against the Ottoman tide.\" He makes the sign of the cross. \"God's work, truly.\"\n\nHe pauses, letting the benediction settle.\n\n\"But I confess, I also wished to speak with you of other matters. Matters closer to home.\" His fingers touch his pectoral cross lightly. \"Your speech last night was... remarkable. The kingdom of heaven. Unity between Castile and Aragon. Don Guillem de Vic's public commitment.\"\n\nHis eyes are fixed on Juan now, that benevolent expression unchanged but somehow sharper.\n\n\"The court is buzzing with it this morning. Some say they witnessed the beginning of a new era. Others wonder what it means for... existing arrangements.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands—an open, innocent gesture.\n\n\"I am merely a shepherd of souls, of course. Politics is not my domain. But I find myself curious, Your Majesty: when you speak of the kingdom of heaven, what precisely do you envision? And how might the Church—how might Barcelona's Church—serve this vision?\"\n\nNPC ANALYSIS:\n\nWhat the Bishop wants:\n\nTo understand Juan's actual intentions and ambitions\n\nTo determine how this \"unity\" talk affects Church interests in Aragon\n\nTo position the Barcelona diocese favorably with whoever holds power\n\nTo gauge whether Juan is a genuine religious visionary or a politician using religious language\n\nTo protect his diocese's prerogatives and revenues\n\nWhat he won't say:\n\nThat he's nervous about Castilian influence over Aragonese church affairs\n\nThat he's wondering if Juan's control over the Military Orders will extend to other ecclesiastical matters\n\nThat he's calculating which faction to align with\n\nThat \"merely a shepherd of souls\" is a deliberate understatement of his political involvement\n\nThat he's already heard rumors about succession and wants to know if they're true"

He praises Juan's humility, praises Lucia's presence, praises María's governance — and then turns every question back on Juan. \"What concerns has Your Majesty heard? What arrangements does Your Majesty wonder about?\" He will not be the one to speak first. The conversation becomes a polite dance where neither party reveals anything. Juan learns nothing about Aragonese Church concerns; the bishop learns nothing about Juan's real intentions. Stalemate.\n\n16-30: Probing Counter-Questions\nThe bishop thanks Juan for his openness, then begins asking pointed questions disguised as innocent curiosity. \"Your Majesty's relationship with His Holiness is remarkable — does the Pope speak of Aragonese matters?\" \"The Military Orders now answer to Castile's crown — a fascinating development. How does Your Majesty envision their role in... cooperative endeavors?\" He's fishing for information while giving none. Juan realizes the bishop is a skilled political operator who will not be easily charmed.\n\n31-45: Vague Concerns, No Specifics\nThe bishop offers generalities without committing to specifics. \"There are always concerns when great changes occur, Your Majesty. The faithful wonder what unity means for their parishes. The clergy wonder what it means for their... arrangements.\" He gestures vaguely. \"Nothing concrete, you understand. Merely the natural uncertainty that accompanies great events.\" He's acknowledging concerns exist without naming them — testing whether Juan will fill the silence with his own plans.\n\n46-60: One Safe Concern, Testing Response\nThe bishop offers a single, relatively safe concern to test Juan's response. Perhaps the Council of Basel and what it means for Church authority. Perhaps the question of crusade financing and whether Aragonese Church revenues might be expected to contribute to Constantinople. Something real but not threatening — a probe to see how Juan handles Church matters before revealing anything more sensitive. He watches Juan's response carefully.\n\n61-75: Genuine Engagement, Still Guarded\nSomething in Juan's manner — the deference, Lucia's presence, the reference to María — persuades the bishop that this might be a real conversation. He opens slightly, mentioning that Aragonese clergy have concerns about Castilian ecclesiastical influence, about what \"unity\" means for Church appointments, about whether Barcelona's traditional privileges will be respected. But he frames these as things \"others\" have said, maintaining deniability. He's engaging but protecting himself.\n\n76-85: Frank Discussion, Mutual Interest\nThe bishop decides Juan is worth trusting — at least partially. He speaks more directly about Church concerns: the fear that Castilian bishops will gain influence over Aragonese appointments; worry about Military Order precedent extending to other Church matters; questions about how papal favor for Juan affects Aragonese clergy who supported Basel's reforms. He's not hostile but he's direct. He also begins asking what Juan might offer in exchange for Church support.\n\n86-95: Strategic Alliance Forming\nThe bishop sees opportunity rather than threat. Juan's papal connections, his crusading credentials, his evident piety — these could benefit Barcelona's diocese if properly cultivated. He shares concerns openly and begins suggesting how they might work together. Perhaps Juan could advocate for Barcelona's interests in Rome? Perhaps the diocese could support Juan's vision in exchange for guarantees about Aragonese Church autonomy? A genuine negotiation begins.\n\n96-100: Unexpected Candor\nSomething about this moment — Juan's humility, Lucia's presence, the morning light through the cathedral windows — moves the bishop past political calculation. He speaks with unusual honesty about the Church's fears and hopes, about what he's seen in forty years of ecclesiastical politics, about what he believes God actually wants versus what powerful men claim He wants. A real spiritual conversation emerges alongside the political one. The bishop becomes not just an ally but a genuine advisor.\n\nReady to roll, Your Majesty?"

His fingers tap once against his pectoral cross—a thinking gesture, perhaps unconscious.\n\nThen something in his posture shifts. Not dramatically—he's too practiced for that—but the benevolent mask relaxes slightly, revealing something sharper and more genuine beneath.\n\n\"You wish me to educate you,\" he says slowly. \"Very well, Your Majesty. I will speak more frankly than I had intended.\"\n\nHe rises and walks to the window, looking out at the unfinished cathedral.\n\n\"I have been Bishop of Barcelona for eleven years. In that time, I have watched three popes, two antipopes, a council that nearly tore Christendom apart, and a king of Aragon who visits his kingdom perhaps once every three years.\" He turns back to face them. \"I have learned to be... cautious. About what I say. To whom I say it.\"\n\nHe returns to his chair, settling into it with the weariness of a man who has carried heavy things for a long time.\n\n\"But you bring your queen. You speak of listening. You reference Her Majesty the regent with respect. And you have the favor of Pope Eugenius, which is not nothing in these times.\" A pause. \"So. Frankly.\"\n\nHe steeples his fingers.\n\n\"There are three concerns that keep Aragonese churchmen awake at night, Your Majesty. I will name them.\"\n\nHe raises one finger.\n\n\"First: the Military Orders. You now control Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara by papal decree. The masters answer to Castile's crown.\" His eyes are steady on Juan's. \"These orders have commanderies in Aragon. They hold lands, collect revenues, wield influence. When Aragonese clergy look at what happened in Castile, they wonder: are we next? Will Your Majesty seek similar authority over institutions that have traditionally answered to... other powers?\"\n\nA second finger rises.\n\n\"Second: appointments. The bishops of Castile are, increasingly, men who align with royal interests. This is natural—kings prefer cooperative clergy.\" A thin smile. \"But Aragon has its own traditions. The Cathedral Chapter of Barcelona has elected its own bishops for centuries. If 'unity' means Castilian influence over Aragonese appointments—if Toledo begins to speak for Barcelona—there will be resistance. Quiet resistance, perhaps. But real.\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"Third: Basel.\" He lets the word hang in the air. \"Your Majesty supported Pope Eugenius against the Council. This was wise—Eugenius prevailed, and you have his gratitude. But some Aragonese clergy supported the Council's reforms. They believed—still believe—that the Church needs change, that papal authority has grown too absolute, that councils should check papal power.\"\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\"These men are not heretics. They are not your enemies. But they wonder if Your Majesty's closeness to Eugenius means they will be... remembered. Punished. Passed over for preferment because they chose the wrong side in a dispute that is supposedly resolved.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands—an open gesture, offering what he's said for examination.\n\n\"These are the concerns, Your Majesty. Spoken plainly, as you requested.\"\n\nHe glances at Lucia, then back to Juan.\n\n\"Now. You said you wished to address them if within your power. I am listening. What does the Conqueror of Granada, the Champion of Constantinople, the man who speaks of the kingdom of heaven—what does he say to a tired bishop who worries about the Church he has spent his life serving?\"\n\nThe question is direct. The bishop has laid his cards on the table.\n\nHe waits to see what Juan holds."

And let me thank you for being so open.\n\n\nLet me first adress your concern about military orders. I seek not to establish more control over other institutions of the church. And I can add that the current arrangement was done with total mutual agreement and cooperation. The military orders were left without a purpose after the reconquista so we have found a new way, a new goal to set our sights to. If the masters of the orders were here, they would tell you that the arrangement is mutually beneficial. They have gained a new purpose and I have granted them even more lands in Grenada as well. In short, the situation with the military orders are unique, I do not seek to aquire other institutions and I now and always seek to cooperate with the church and it's institutions.\n\n\nYour second issue touches on how bishops are elected. You may be pleased to learn that I have already openly committed to this position. Our Basel delegation is supporting this, as well as other reforms we may yet discuss. But in the case of the Barcelona bishop and it's election procedure, I fully support that cathedral chapters elect their own bishops. Lucia, do we have a copy of our delegation position with us?\n\n\nAnd concerning your third issue, you may learn that I support quite some reforms of the council. If I am totally honest, I feel like the church must reform and should also find a way to re-establish it's authority and keep the church united. The path to such an outcome is...difficult. I support reforms and consider them essential to prevent another scism. I plan to Rome as soon as possible and I carry with me a letter signed by both me and the emperor of the holy roman empire. Lucia, can we let the bishop read our letter? I think it best describes my position concerning the council and reform.

How much do we share?\n\nThe bishop watches this exchange with sharp interest. His eyes follow the letter as it passes from Lucia to Juan.\n\n\"You travel with Imperial correspondence,\" he observes quietly. \"And your queen knows which documents to produce.\" A pause. \"You are better prepared than most kings who claim to be 'listening and learning,' Your Majesty.\"\n\nHe extends his hand for whatever Juan chooses to share, but his expression has changed. The benevolent mask is entirely gone now. What remains is a man of considerable intelligence, reassessing a situation that has become more complex than he anticipated.\n\n\"Before I read,\" he says slowly, \"I must ask directly. Your Majesty has the favor of Pope Eugenius. You carry letters co-signed with the Emperor. You claim to support Council reforms while maintaining papal relationships.\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"How? How does one hold both positions without being torn apart? Eugenius and the Council have been at war for years. The Pope dissolved Basel; the Council declared him suspended.

Lucia rises to join them, positioning herself where she can observe both men.\n\n\"This is everything,\" Juan says simply.\n\nThe bishop's eyes widen slightly at the volume of material. His practiced composure slips for just a moment—this is not what he expected from a king who claimed to be \"listening and learning.\"\n\nThe Documents Revealed:\n\nJuan arranges them methodically, providing commentary as the bishop examines each:\n\nFirst: The Declaration of Como — The joint statement signed by Emperor Sigismund and Juan, sealed with both the Imperial eagle and Castilian arms. Six articles covering reform of pluralism, electoral restoration, annates caps, institutional oversight, Bohemian reconciliation, and coordinated efforts.\n\n\"Signed in June of last year,\" Juan explains. \"The Emperor and I spoke through an entire night. We found we wanted the same things.\"\n\nThe bishop reads slowly, his fingers tracing the signatures. \"Sigismundus Dei Gratia Romanorum Rex... and your own seal beside it.\" He looks up. \"You and the Emperor speak with one voice on reform?\"\n\n\"On these specific reforms, yes.\"\n\nSecond: The Letter to Pope Eugenius IV — The joint correspondence proposing \"parallel legislation\" — the Pope adopting Council reforms by his own authority rather than submitting to conciliar supremacy.\n\nThe bishop reads the key passage aloud, softly: \"What the Council has passed, Your Holiness may pass independently—the same reforms, the same language, issued on your own initiative as Supreme Pontiff. In this way, the Church is reformed without any admission that councils may command popes.\"\n\nHe sets the letter down carefully. \"This is... elegant. Substance without surrender. Reform without constitutional crisis.\"\n\n\"That was the intention.\"\n\nThird: The Castilian Delegation Instructions — The formal position document outlining Castile's stance at Basel.\n\nThe bishop's eyes find the critical passages:\n\nSUPPORT communion in both kinds for the laity\n\nSUPPORT abolishing simony\n\nSUPPORT limiting multiple benefices (grandfather existing arrangements)\n\nSUPPORT free elections to benefices based on merit\n\nSUPPORT measures against concubinage\n\nSUPPORT improved education for parish priests\n\nMAINTAIN NEUTRALITY on Haec Sancta — refuse to declare either Pope OR Council absolutely supreme\n\n\"You support chapter elections,\" the bishop says slowly. \"It says so explicitly here.\"\n\n\"As I told you. This is not new policy—it has been our position since our delegation arrived at Basel.\"\n\nFourth: The Council of Basel Session 12 Decree — The twenty-three page electoral reform decree, abolishing papal reservations and establishing canonical election procedures.\n\n\"This passed in July of '33,\" Juan says. \"Our delegation supported it. The language was influenced by Castilian proposals—Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena's speeches were cited favorably.\"\n\nThe bishop pages through the dense Latin text, pausing at the oath required of electors, at the simony provisions, at the penalties for violation. \"This is... comprehensive.\"\n\n\"It is what reform looks like when it is actually written into law, rather than merely promised.\"\n\nThe bishop sits back in his chair, surrounded by documents. The benevolent mask is entirely gone now. What remains is a man genuinely surprised—and genuinely reassessing.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says slowly. \"I came to this meeting expecting diplomatic pleasantries. Perhaps some vague assurances. Perhaps an attempt to extract something from Barcelona's diocese in exchange for empty promises.\"\n\nHe gestures at the papers spread before him.\n\n\"Instead you have shown me... everything.

The positions are real. The Emperor's signature is real.\n\nJuan isn't asking for anything in return for showing all this\n\nWhat the Bishop is feeling:\n\nConfusion — this doesn't fit any pattern he knows\n\nSuspicion — is this too good to be true?\n\nHope — could this actually be genuine?\n\nVulnerability — he's been shown trust, which creates obligation\n\nProfessional reassessment — he may have misjudged Juan entirely\n\nSpiritual stirring — when was the last time a king spoke to him about the Church's actual mission?\n\nWhat he won't say (yet):\n\nThat he's moved in ways he didn't expect\n\nThat this reminds him of why he became a priest\n\nThat he's spent so long in politics he'd forgotten what genuine faith looks like in a ruler\n\nThat he's ashamed of his own cynicism\n\nThat he wants to believe but is afraid to\n\nThe tension:\n\nA lifetime of ecclesiastical politics has taught him everyone wants something\n\nJuan appears to want nothing except for the Church to be good\n\nThe bishop must decide: is this real, or is he being played at a level he can't perceive?\n\nD100 TABLE: BISHOP'S RESPONSE\n\nSuccess Factors\n\nJuan showed all his documents — unprecedented transparency\n\nJuan asked for nothing in return\n\nJuan's answer focused on the Church's mission, not politics\n\nThe positions are genuinely pro-reform and pro-chapter elections\n\nThe Emperor's co-signature validates Juan's sincerity\n\n\"Doing good is its own reward\" — this resonates spiritually\n\nJuan's consistency: speech last night, this morning, these documents — all align\n\nFailure Factors\n\nLifetime of cynicism is hard to overcome\n\n\"Too good to be true\" instinct is strong\n\nBishop has been burned by kings' promises before\n\nThe kingdom of heaven language could sound grandiose\n\nNo concrete ask makes the bishop uncertain what the relationship is\n\nVulnerability of having been shown trust — creates discomfort\n\nD100 TABLE\n\n1-10: Defensive Retreat\nThe bishop's defenses snap back up. This is too perfect, too rehearsed. No king speaks this way without an agenda. He thanks Juan politely, praises the documents, but something has closed behind his eyes. He will be cooperative but guarded. He suspects he's being manipulated at a level he can't perceive, and that suspicion will color everything going forward. The opportunity for genuine connection is lost.\n\n11-25: Polite Skepticism\nThe bishop is impressed but not convinced. He's seen idealistic kings before — they usually want something eventually. He thanks Juan for his openness, makes appreciative noises about the reforms, but maintains professional distance. He'll report favorably to other Aragonese clergy, but he won't commit personally. The relationship remains transactional beneath the pleasant surface.\n\n26-40: Cautious Respect\nThe bishop acknowledges this is unlike any conversation he's had with a king. He's genuinely impressed by the documents, genuinely surprised by Juan's answer. But decades of caution hold him back from full trust. He offers measured support — Barcelona will not oppose Juan's vision, will speak well of him to other clergy. But he stops short of personal commitment. He needs to see if Juan's actions match his words over time.\n\n41-55: Genuine Engagement\nSomething shifts. The bishop decides to take a risk — to respond to Juan's openness with his own. He admits he came to this meeting expecting politics and found something else. He asks questions — real questions, not probing ones — about Juan's faith, his vision, how he reconciles power with genuine belief. A real conversation begins. The bishop may become a supporter, not just a non-opponent.\n\n56-70: Unexpected Honesty\nThe bishop surprises himself. He tells Juan something he hasn't told anyone: that he's spent so long in church politics he sometimes forgets why he became a priest. That Juan's words — about marriages, education, confession, charity — reminded him of something he'd lost. He doesn't fully commit to Juan's cause, but he opens a door he thought was closed. A genuine human connection forms beneath the political one.\n\n71-85: Spiritual Recognition\nThe bishop sees something in Juan he hasn't seen in a ruler before — genuine faith that hasn't been corrupted by power. He responds not as a church politician but as a priest. He speaks of his own struggles, his own hopes for the Church, his own frustrations with corruption and faction. The conversation becomes something neither expected — two men of faith talking about what the Church should be. The bishop commits to supporting Juan's vision, not from calculation but from conviction.\n\n86-95: Pastoral Response\nSomething breaks open in the bishop. Juan's words — the simple description of what the Church should do — cut through decades of cynicism. He rises, moves to stand before Juan, and does something unexpected: he offers a blessing. Not a formal diplomatic blessing, but a real one — a priest blessing a man he believes is doing God's work. \"I have waited a long time,\" he says quietly, \"to meet a king who wanted what you want.\" A true alliance forms, rooted in shared faith rather than mutual interest.\n\n96-100: Transformative Moment\nThe bishop weeps. He cannot help it. Sixty years old, eleven years a bishop, decades of careful maneuvering and political calculation — and a young king has just reminded him why he gave his life to God. He speaks of things he has never told anyone: his doubts, his compromises, his fear that he had lost his way. Juan has given him something more valuable than any political alliance — he has given him back his vocation. The bishop becomes not just an ally but a true believer in Juan's vision, and will work to spread it among Aragonese clergy with the fervor of a man who has rediscovered his faith.\n\nReady to roll, Your Majesty?"

Then he looks back at Juan.\n\nSomething shifts in his face. The politician recedes. What remains is older, more tired, more human.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says quietly. \"May I speak to you not as Bishop of Barcelona to King of Castile, but as... as a priest? As a man who took vows forty years ago and has spent most of that time forgetting why?\"\n\nHe doesn't wait for permission. He rises from his desk and moves to the window, looking out at the unfinished cathedral—the scaffolding, the half-completed spires reaching toward heaven.\n\n\"I was twenty when I entered the Church. I believed... I believed what you just said. That the Church existed to do good. To marry the faithful, educate the young, comfort the dying, feed the hungry.\" His voice is rough. \"I believed that if we did these things, we walked in God's glory. A slice of heaven on earth.\"\n\nHe turns back to face Juan and Lucia.\n\n\"Do you know what forty years of church politics does to that belief, Your Majesty? It doesn't kill it quickly. That would be merciful. It kills it slowly. One compromise at a time. One appointment made for political reasons rather than pastoral ones. One reform delayed because the timing wasn't right. One principle set aside because the greater good required flexibility.\"\n\nHe returns to his chair, sitting heavily.\n\n\"I have not thought about why I became a priest in... I cannot remember how long. Years, perhaps. I think about revenues and appointments and factions and which cardinal to cultivate and which bishop to avoid. I think about Barcelona's position relative to Tarragona, about the chapter's privileges, about protecting what we have built.\"\n\nHis eyes meet Juan's.\n\n\"And then a king walks into my study, shows me everything—everything—and when I ask what he wants, he tells me he wants the Church to bless marriages and teach the gospel and hear confessions and feed the poor.\"\n\nHe laughs—a strange sound, half-bitter, half-wondering.\n\n\"I had forgotten that was the point. Do you understand? I had forgotten that was the point.\"\n\nHe leans forward, and his voice drops.\n\n\"I have met many kings, Your Majesty. I have met kings who wanted Church lands, Church gold, Church influence. I have met kings who wanted bishops in their pockets and abbots who would bless their wars. I have met kings who spoke of God while reaching for power, who wrapped their ambitions in holy language.\"\n\nHe shakes his head slowly.\n\n\"I have never met a king who wanted what you want. Who showed me his entire hand and asked for nothing except that I do my duty to God.\"\n\nHe is quiet for a moment, gathering himself.\n\n\"You spoke last night of the kingdom of heaven. Of glimpsing it in moments—at Alcalá, at your daughter's birth. I confess I thought it was rhetoric. Beautiful words for a beautiful speech.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan—really looks, the way a priest looks at a soul.\n\n\"I do not think it is rhetoric. I think you mean it. And I think...\"\n\nHis voice wavers slightly.\n\n\"I think I have been waiting a very long time to meet a king who meant it.\"\n\nHe straightens in his chair, reassembling some of his composure, though the professional mask no longer quite fits.\n\n\"You asked earlier what concerns keep Aragonese churchmen awake at night. I told you three: the Military Orders, appointments, and Basel.\"\n\nHe gestures at the documents.\n\n\"You have addressed all three. More than addressed—you have shown me you were already working on these matters before I raised them. The chapter elections. The reform support. The neutrality on constitutional questions while pushing for substance.\"\n\nHe folds his hands.\n\n\"So let me tell you what I can offer in return—not as payment, but as... partnership. As a priest who has remembered, thanks to you, why he took his vows.\"\n\nHe holds up one finger.\n\n\"First: I will write to the Archbishop of Tarragona and to the bishops of Girona, Vic, and Urgell. I will tell them what I have seen here today. I will tell them that the King of Castile supports chapter elections, supports reform, and asks nothing from us except that we do our duty. This will matter. These men trust me, and they have been worried.\"\n\nA second finger.\n\n\"Second: I will speak to the Catalan clergy about your Constantinople expedition. Not as a political venture, but as what it is—a crusade to defend Christendom. I will encourage prayers, encourage support, encourage the faithful to see this as holy work.\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"Third: When you return from Constantinople—when, Your Majesty, not if, for I will pray daily for your safe return—I will be here. And if your vision of unity between Castile and Aragon moves forward, you will find in Barcelona's Church not an obstacle but an ally. Because you are not seeking to control the Church. You are seeking to free it to do what it was always meant to do.\"\n\nHe rises, and moves to stand before Juan.\n\n\"Your Majesty. I am too old and too tired to kneel easily. But will you permit an old priest to give you his blessing? Not a diplomatic blessing. A real one. For a man I believe is doing God's work.\""

It's been so long\n\nFear — what if he tries and fails?

This is not the ceremonial blessing he has given a thousand times to nobles seeking favor, to merchants wanting church approval for their ventures, to diplomats who needed the appearance of ecclesiastical support.\n\nThis is something else.\n\nHe places his hands on Juan's head. His voice, when it comes, is rougher than he intends.\n\n\"Benedictio Dei omnipotentis, Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, descendat super te et maneat semper.\"\n\nThe Latin comes automatically, but beneath it, something stirs — something that has been sleeping for a very long time.\n\n\"May the Lord bless you and keep you,\" he continues, switching to Castilian. \"May He make His face to shine upon you, and be gracious unto you. May He lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace.\"\n\nHis hands remain on Juan's head a moment longer than necessary.\n\n\"Go to Constantinople, Your Majesty. Defend the faith. And come home safely to your wife and your daughter and the kingdoms that need you.\"\n\nHe withdraws his hands, and Juan rises.\n\nThen Juan speaks of prayer. Of Mass. Of seeing \"the priest who joined at twenty who believed.\"\n\nThe bishop's expression flickers — something crosses his face that he cannot quite hide. He turns away, moving back toward the window, and is quiet for a long moment.\n\nWhen he speaks, his voice is different. Smaller. Less certain.\n\n\"You ask to see a man I am not sure still exists, Your Majesty.\"\n\nHe stares out at the unfinished cathedral.\n\n\"I have said Mass thousands of times. Thousands. The words are... they are words now. I say them correctly. I perform the liturgy with precision. The faithful receive the sacrament and go home satisfied.\" A pause. \"But the priest who believed... he would have meant every word. He would have felt the presence of God in the bread and wine, not merely affirmed it doctrinally.\"\n\nHe turns back to face Juan and Lucia.\n\n\"You have given me something today. Something I thought I had lost forever. But I cannot simply... become that man again in an afternoon. Faith is not a garment one puts on and takes off.\"\n\nHis voice drops.\n\n\"I am afraid, Your Majesty. Afraid that if I try to pray with you as that young priest would have prayed, you will see what I fear is true — that he is gone, and only the politician remains wearing his vestments.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands — a gesture of helplessness from a man not accustomed to admitting helplessness.\n\n\"I will say Mass tomorrow morning. The Feast of... no, it is simply an ordinary day. An ordinary Mass for ordinary faithful.\" He swallows. \"You are welcome to attend. You and the Queen. But I ask that you not expect... I ask that you understand I am only beginning to remember. I cannot promise that the priest who believed will be there. Only that I will try to find him.\"\n\nHe meets Juan's eyes.\n\n\"Is that enough? For a king who speaks of trying, who told his court that all we can do is try — is my trying enough?\""

A servant bows as they pass; neither really notices.\n\n\"The bishop gave you his blessing, his support, his promise to write to other clergy. Not because you demanded it. Not because you explained why he should. Because you asked what he feared, and then showed him he had nothing to fear from you.\"\n\nShe glances at him sidelong.\n\n\"And with María... you led with your plan. You told her what you wanted. You offered protection, position, assurances.\" A pause. \"All good things. But you told her what you had decided she needed, rather than asking what she feared.\"\n\nThey round another corner. The nursery wing is ahead — they can hear the distant sound of a child's voice, possibly demanding something with great conviction.\n\n\"She is still here, caro. Still in this palace. Still your sister.\" Lucia's voice is soft. \"The bishop was a stranger this morning, and now he weeps when he speaks of you. María has known you her whole life, and she is hurt.\"\n\nShe stops walking, turning to face him.\n\n\"When you speak to her again — and you must, before we sail — perhaps try what worked with the bishop. Ask her what she fears. Ask her what she wants. Not what you think she should want. What she actually wants.\"\n\nA small smile crosses her face.\n\n\"And if you are uncertain what to say, you may wink at me. I will be watching.\"\n\nShe takes his arm again and resumes walking toward the sound of their daughter's voice.\n\n\"Now. Let us see what diplomatic crisis Catalina has created with the nursery staff.\""

A real smile, not the queenly composure she wears in public. The smile of the woman beneath the crown.\n\n\"And I love you, Juan of Castile,\" she says softly. \"Even when you swing your hammer at things that do not need hammering.\"\n\nShe squeezes his arm.\n\n\"Especially then.\"\n\nTHE NURSERY\n\nThey find Catalina in a sunlit room overlooking a garden, surrounded by evidence of extensive negotiations.\n\nThe scene: Donna Francesca sits in a chair with the expression of a woman who has been thoroughly outmaneuvered. A young Aragonese nursemaid hovers nearby, looking uncertain. On a small table sits an empty plate with suspicious crumbs. On another table sits a second empty plate with more suspicious crumbs.\n\nCatalina herself is on the floor, engaged in serious diplomatic discussions with a boy of perhaps four years — dark-haired, solemn-faced, dressed in fine clothes that mark him as noble-born. Between them are arranged several wooden animals, a small cloth ball, and what appears to be a torn piece of parchment that has been folded into something vaguely boat-shaped.\n\n\"No,\" Catalina is saying firmly. \"Bird goes here. Horse goes there. Is obvious.\"\n\nThe boy considers this with the gravity of a treaty negotiation. \"But the horse wants to be with the bird.\"\n\n\"Horse is wrong.\"\n\nDonna Francesca rises quickly as Juan and Lucia enter, her face flushing.\n\n\"Your Majesties. The princess has been... she has been very well-behaved.\" The slight hesitation suggests a generous interpretation of \"well-behaved.\" \"She has made a friend. This is young Lord Bernat, son of the Viscount of Cardona. His mother brought him to play while she attends the regent.\"\n\nCatalina looks up at her parents' entrance. Her face brightens.\n\n\"Papa! Mama! Catalina has a friend. His name is...\" She frowns, the name escaping her. \"His name is Boy.\"\n\n\"Bernat,\" the boy corrects with dignity.\n\n\"Ber-nat,\" Catalina repeats carefully. Then, with evident pride: \"Catalina taught him about horses. He did not know horses go there.\"\n\nShe points to a specific spot on the floor that apparently holds cosmic significance.\n\nLucia's hand covers her mouth, suppressing a laugh. She crouches down to the children's level.\n\n\"And how many crostatas did this important lesson require, piccola?\"\n\nCatalina's expression becomes studiedly innocent — an expression she has clearly been practicing.\n\n\"One and a half,\" she says. \"Like we agreed.\"\n\nDonna Francesca coughs quietly.\n\n\"Perhaps... perhaps there were two and a half, Your Majesty. The young lord was hungry, and the princess felt it was only fair to keep him company.\"\n\nCatalina nods solemnly. \"Fair,\" she agrees. \"Company.\""

      "summary": "Juan and Lucia visit the nursery where Catalina has made a friend — young Lord Bernat, four-year-old son of the Viscount of Cardona. Catalina has been bossing him around, taking his toy horse, boasting about her father conquering a kingdom versus Bernat's mere viscounty, and keeping more than her share of crostatas (eating two while giving Bernat only half of one). Juan teaches Catalina two lessons: it is better to let others tell of your good deeds rather than boasting yourself, and one must always share equally. Catalina grudgingly processes these lessons, agreeing to give Bernat a crostata next time. Juan then suggests Catalina play the viscountess while Bernat plays king, to see how it feels. After extensive negotiation, Catalina agrees — but only 'for a little while,' and specifying the viscountess is very important, owns the horse (the king only borrows it), and the king listens to her advice. The chapter ends as Juan and Lucia leave for their next appointment, with Lucia noting their daughter will be 'terrifying when she is sixteen.'",

And she said her papa conquered a whole kingdom and my papa only has a...\" He struggles with the word. \"A viscounty.\"\n\nCatalina's expression flickers — caught between indignation at this betrayal and the dawning realization that witnesses are inconvenient.\n\n\"Horse was in the wrong place,\" she insists, as though this justified all subsequent actions. \"And Papa did conquer a kingdom. Is true.\"\n\nDonna Francesca sighs quietly. \"The princess has strong opinions about proper organization, Your Majesty. And about the relative merits of different animals. And about... comparative territorial holdings.\"\n\nLucia has given up suppressing her laughter. She crouches beside Bernat, who looks somewhat overwhelmed by the sudden presence of two monarchs.\n\n\"Lord Bernat,\" she says gently. \"Did Catalina share her crostatas with you, at least?\"\n\nThe boy nods. \"She gave me half of one. She said it was generous.\"\n\n\"Half,\" Catalina confirms from Juan's arms, holding up her hand with fingers splayed in a rough approximation of the fraction. \"Catalina is very generous.\"\n\nShe pats Juan's cheek — her gesture of approval — and then leans in conspiratorially.\n\n\"Papa. Bernat does not know about rope. Or about the boy in the water. Should Catalina tell him?\"\n\nShe is asking permission to share her legend. Apparently even at twenty months, she understands the value of a good story."

If she doesn't tell people about the rope and the boy in the water, how will the information reach them? The mechanics of reputation are unclear to her.\n\nLucia rises, brushing off her gown. \"Others will tell him, piccola. The story travels on its own. And when you do not tell it, but others do, it becomes even more... impressive.\"\n\nCatalina considers this. \"More impressive,\" she repeats slowly.\n\n\"Yes. Because it means the story is so good that other people want to tell it.\"\n\nThis appears to satisfy something in Catalina's small strategist mind. She nods slowly, then turns her attention to the second part of Juan's instruction.\n\n\"Share... equally?\" She looks down at Bernat, then at the empty plates, performing some internal calculation. \"Catalina had two. Bernat had half.\" She frowns. \"That is not equal.\"\n\n\"No,\" Juan confirms. \"It is not.\"\n\nCatalina squirms slightly in his arms — the particular squirm of a child confronting an uncomfortable truth.\n\n\"But Catalina was hungry,\" she protests weakly.\n\nBernat, from the floor, adds with devastating four-year-old honesty: \"She said she was a princess and princesses get more.\"\n\nDonna Francesca closes her eyes briefly, as if praying for patience.\n\nCatalina's face cycles through several emotions — indignation, embarrassment, and finally something approaching sheepishness.

That is what makes it play.\"\n\nCatalina looks down at Bernat, who is watching this exchange with the quiet fascination of a child witnessing something unprecedented. The idea that he could be king, even in pretend, has clearly never occurred to him.\n\n\"I could be king?\" he asks, a note of wonder in his voice.\n\nCatalina's mouth opens, then closes. She looks at Juan, then at Lucia, then back at Bernat. Some internal struggle is taking place — the natural Trastámara pride wrestling with her father's instruction about sharing equally.\n\nFinally, with the air of someone making an enormous concession: \"Bernat can be king. For a little while.\"\n\nShe holds up her fingers, pinched close together to indicate just how little a while she means.\n\n\"And Catalina will be...\" She struggles with the word. \"Vis-coun-tess.

And the king listens to her advice because she is very smart.\"\n\nBernat considers this arrangement. \"Can the king have the horse?\"\n\n\"The king can borrow the horse,\" Catalina allows. \"Because he is king.
