      "summary": "Tommaso Parentucelli, secretary to Cardinal Albergati, is summoned to the private papal audience where Juan II and Pope Eugenius IV have been meeting. Eugenius demands his honest assessment of Camera corruption. Parentucelli, cautious after twenty years in curial politics, gives a damning verdict: corruption is systemic, fees are extracted for services never rendered, benefices are held by absentees, and reform is always promised but never delivered. Juan proposes radical reforms: all Camera obligations declared null and void, annates reformed and split between Camera and College of Cardinals, Camera reduced to handling only Church expenditure. Parentucelli recognizes the political elegance of the proposal but probes Juan's motives, asking bluntly 'What does Castile gain?' Juan responds with pure idealism — a united Church is its own reward. Parentucelli, still guarded, then asks the more personal question: what protection exists for him when powerful cardinals learn of his involvement?",

Past promises of ecclesiastical reform have been hollow, and I've learned to be wary of sudden opportunities. My loyalty to Albergati means I'll be cautious about any proposal that might compromise his position or my own carefully maintained neutrality. I need to understand the true motivations behind this unexpected summons.\n\nNow I have the full context. Let me continue the scene.\n\nThe afternoon light slants through the chamber's high windows, catching motes of dust that drift lazily through the stillness. Tommaso Parentucelli remains on his knees, a slight figure in plain black cassock—no silk, no embroidery, nothing to suggest rank or ambition. His tonsure is freshly shaved, his hands rough from copying manuscripts rather than wielding power.\n\nPope Eugenius IV studies the kneeling man for a long moment. Something passes across the Pontiff's weathered features—calculation, yes, but something else too. Hope, perhaps. Or fear of disappointment.\n\n\"Rise, Tommaso.\"\n\nParentucelli rises with economical grace, but his eyes—sharp, dark, missing nothing—have already taken in the scene. The King of Castile standing in private audience. No secretary, no cardinal. The Pope's discarded notes scattered across a side table. The empty wine cups. The air of conspiracy that hangs heavier than incense.\n\nHis face reveals nothing. Whatever fire burns in this man, he has long since learned to bank it.\n\nEugenius gestures broadly. \"You know who stands beside Us.\"\n\n\"His Majesty Juan of Castile.\" Parentucelli's voice is quiet, precise—a scholar's voice, trained for clarity rather than command. He offers a respectful nod to the king. \"The conqueror of Granada. Your arrival in Rome has been... discussed.\"\n\nThe word carries weight. Discussed could mean anything from idle gossip to desperate hope to suspicious whispers.\n\nEugenius rises from his chair, suddenly restless, and moves toward the window. His white robes catch the light.\n\n\"Tommaso, We are going to ask you something, and We require complete honesty. Not what you think We wish to hear. Not what advances your position. The truth as you understand it.\" The Pope's back remains turned. \"You have served the Camera. You have watched its workings. You have traveled with Cardinal Albergati through the courts of Europe and seen how Rome appears to those outside these walls.\"\n\nA pause. Parentucelli's hands have tightened at his sides.\n\n\"Tell Us—\" Eugenius turns, and his eyes are fierce. \"Is the corruption as bad as they say? Basel, the French, the Germans—when they accuse Rome of bleeding Christendom dry through fees and dispensations and vacant benefices... are they speaking lies? Or are they speaking truths We have refused to hear?\"\n\nThe silence stretches. Parentucelli's face has gone very still. This is a trap, or a test, or genuine inquiry—and the wrong answer to any of them could destroy a man who has spent twenty years building a career on careful scholarship and quiet loyalty.\n\nWhen he finally speaks, his voice is steady but soft.\n\n\"Your Holiness asks for honesty.\"\n\n\"We demand it.\"\n\nParentucelli's jaw tightens. \"Then—\" He stops. Starts again. His dark eyes flicker briefly to Juan, assessing, calculating. A king present for this conversation. Why? What does Castile want?\n\n\"Then I must say that what the Council says of Rome's corruption is not entirely false.\" The words come out carefully, each one weighed. \"I have seen... irregularities. Documents that do not balance. Fees extracted for services never rendered. Benefices held by men who have never seen the parishes that feed them. The Camera—\"\n\nHe stops himself.\n\n\"Continue,\" Eugenius says quietly.\n\n\"The Camera operates as it has for generations, Holy Father. The men within it are not evil. They are simply... accustomed. What would be theft in any other context has become procedure. What would be simony has become the done thing.\"\n\nHis voice gains an edge—something long suppressed rising to the surface.\n\n\"And those who speak of reform are told that reform is coming. Always coming. Next year. After the crisis passes. When circumstances permit. But circumstances never permit, because the men who benefit from the current arrangements are the same men who decide when circumstances permit.\"\n\nHe stops abruptly, as if surprised by his own vehemence. His shoulders square, preparing for consequences.\n\n\"That is my honest assessment, Holy Father. I pray I have not spoken out of turn.\"\n\nEugenius turns to look at Juan."

          "text": "Juan is proposing a radical reform:\n1. All camera obligations null and void, referred to college of cardinals\n2. Annates reformed - reduced, half to camera, half to college of cardinals\n3. Camera only handles church expenditure (papal residence, scribes)\n4. All other expenses referred to college of cardinals\n\nThis is a clever political move - it shifts the burden of distributing funds (and the associated corruption/blame) to the cardinals themselves, while keeping the Camera clean and focused on legitimate expenses.\n\nLet me think about Parentucelli's response:\n- He's a scholar, not a politician\n- He burns with fury at corruption but has been powerless\n- He's cautious - he's survived 20 years by being careful\n- He's being offered something he's dreamed of but couldn't achieve\n- He would be suspicious - why is a Castilian king involved in this? What does Castile want?\n- He would see the political cleverness of the proposal\n- But he would also see problems\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? He wants genuine reform. He wants the Church to be what it should be. He's a humanist scholar who believes in the ideal of the Church.\n\nWhat won't he say? He won't openly express his suspicions about Juan's motives. He won't commit fully until he understands what's really happening. He won't show how much he wants this.\n\nThe proposal Juan is making is actually quite clever:\n- It separates the Camera from the corruption by making it purely administrative\n- It forces the cardinals to fight over the money among themselves, which:\n  - Keeps them busy fighting each other rather than opposing the Pope\n  - Makes them responsible for any unpopular decisions\n  - Exposes their greed to each other\n\nBut Parentucelli, as a scholar and someone who understands church law, would have concerns:\n\nI see potential legal and practical challenges in Juan's proposal. The canonical implications are complex - nullifying existing obligations requires careful theological and legal scrutiny. The financial restructuring could destabilize church administration, potentially creating more chaos than reform. His scholarly mind would meticulously analyze every potential consequence, balancing the promise of change against the risks of institutional disruption.\n\n1. Juan and Eugenius are alone (Cardinal Capranica and the secretary were dismissed)\n2. Eugenius confessed to losing faith in the Church\n3. They discussed Camera corruption extensively\n4. Juan proposed a \"fresh start\" approach - declaring existing Camera arrangements null and void\n5. The plan involves:\n   - Half of papal income to cardinals (per Basel's annates decree)\n   - No investigations into past sins\n   - Give corrupt cardinals something to protect\n6. Parentucelli was just summoned and has arrived\n7. Parentucelli just gave his honest assessment of Camera corruption\n\nNow Juan is proposing the specifics:\n- All camera obligations null and void, referred to college of cardinals\n- Annates reformed - reduced, half to camera, half to college of cardinals\n- Camera only handles church expenditure (papal residence, scribes)\n- All other expenses referred to college of cardinals\n\nThis is politically clever - it makes the cardinals fight among themselves for resources while keeping the Camera clean. But Parentucelli, as a scholar and secretary who has served Cardinal Albergati for 20 years, would:\n\n1. See the political brilliance of this approach\n2. Have serious practical/canonical questions\n3. Wonder about Juan's motives - why is a Castilian king so involved?\n4. Be cautious about committing himself\n5. Possibly feel hope that real reform is finally possible\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? \n- He wants genuine reform\n- He wants the Church to be what it should be\n- He wants his patron Albergati's quiet example of simple living to become the norm\n- He wants to matter - to have his years of scholarly work and careful observation count for something\n\nWhat won't he say?\n- He won't openly express how much he wants this\n- He won't show his suspicion about Juan's motives\n- He won't commit fully until he understands the full picture\n\n- He won't express how frustrated he's been watching corruption from the sidelines, silently observing the decay that has eaten away at the Church's moral foundation\n\nI recognize the deep well of suppressed frustration brewing beneath his scholarly composure. Years of meticulous observation have revealed systemic rot, yet he's remained a careful, strategic witness. His internal fire burns with a scholar's restrained passion for true institutional transformation.\n\nParentucelli's eyes widen fractionally—the only betrayal of surprise he permits himself. His gaze moves from Juan to the Pope and back again, processing rapidly. A scholar's mind working through implications, precedents, consequences.\n\n\"Your Majesty proposes...\" He stops himself. Starts again, more carefully. \"Forgive me. I wish to ensure I understand precisely.\"\n\nHe takes a breath. When he speaks, his voice has taken on the precise, methodical quality of a man who has spent decades parsing texts for meaning.\n\n\"All existing Camera obligations—the network of fees, expectations, understandings that have accumulated over generations—declared null and void. A clean ledger. The Camera itself reduced to a household office: paying scribes, maintaining the papal residence, the ordinary costs of governance. Nothing more.\"\n\nHis hands have begun moving as he speaks—a scholar's habit, sketching invisible diagrams in the air.\n\n\"And the remainder—the discretionary funds, the benefice revenues, the annates—divided. Half to the Camera for these limited purposes. Half to the College of Cardinals as a body. Let them determine among themselves how to distribute their portion.\"\n\nHe pauses. Something flickers across his face—almost like hunger.\n\n\"This is... elegant.\" The word seems pulled from him reluctantly. \"The cardinals who have built fortunes on Camera arrangements cannot openly oppose reform without revealing themselves as corrupt. But neither can they quietly sabotage it, because now their income depends on collective decision. Every cardinal becomes a watchdog over every other cardinal's share.\"\n\nHe turns to Eugenius. \"Holy Father, the man who designed this understands politics.\"\n\nThen, more quietly: \"Which is precisely why I must ask questions that may seem impertinent.\"\n\nHe looks directly at Juan now—not with hostility, but with the sharp assessment of a man who has survived two decades in curial politics by never assuming goodwill.\n\n\"Your Majesty comes to Rome with six hundred knights. Your Majesty proposes reforms that would strip the Camera of power and set the cardinals against each other. Your Majesty offers military force to secure the Camera building while this is accomplished.\"\n\nHis voice remains soft, almost gentle.\n\n\"What does Castile gain?\"\n\nThe question hangs in the afternoon air. Parentucelli's hands have stilled. He waits, watching Juan with those dark, clever eyes that have spent twenty years reading between lines."

          "text": "Parentucelli has asked Juan what Castile gains. Juan has responded with pure idealism - that a united church is its own reward, that doing good is its own reward, and that working on God's kingdom fills his heart with joy.\n\nNow I need to think about how Parentucelli would react to this. Let me consider:\n\n**What does Parentucelli want?**\n- He genuinely burns with fury at corruption (per the chapter summary)\n- He has risen through merit, not family connections\n- He has no income beyond his salary\n- He's been Albergati's factotum for 20+ years - loyal, patient, careful\n- He's a scholar and bibliophile with encyclopedic knowledge\n- He will eventually become Pope Nicholas V - so he's ambitious, but his ambition is channeled through patience and service\n\n**What won't he say?**\n- He won't openly express his ambition\n- He won't reveal how much he wants this - how much he's dreamed of reform\n- He won't fully trust Juan yet - he's survived 20 years by being careful\n- He won't commit without understanding the risks\n\n**How would he respond to Juan's idealism?**\n\nParentucelli is a scholar who has seen the gap between ideals and reality for two decades. He's watched reform promised and delayed. He's seen good men crushed by the system. Juan's answer is... exactly what Eugenius said earlier in their conversation before his mask fell. It's the kind of thing people say.\n\nBut Parentucelli also saw Eugenius's confession roll a 93 - genuine connection. Something real happened in this room before he arrived. And Juan's answer IS consistent with what a genuinely pious king might say.\n\nStill, Parentucelli is too smart and too cautious to simply accept this at face value. He's not going to become a willing collaborator immediately. He needs to:\n1. Probe further - is this real?\n2. Understand the risks to himself\n3. Figure out what role he's being asked to play\n\n4. Decide if this is genuine or a trap\n\nI recognize the delicate political landscape requires strategic thinking. My survival and potential for future influence depend on carefully navigating these treacherous waters. The potential for reform is tantalizing, but the risks are substantial - professional destruction or becoming a target for vengeful ecclesiastical powers. I must probe Juan's intentions with surgical precision, revealing nothing of my own hopes while extracting every nuance of his true motivations.\n\nParentucelli is silent for a long moment. His expression is unreadable—the careful neutrality of a man who has learned that revealing his thoughts can be dangerous.\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of doing good as its own reward.\" His voice is soft, measured. \"I have heard such words before. From cardinals who endowed hospitals while selling benefices. From bishops who spoke eloquently of poverty while their servants wore silk.\"\n\nHe holds up a hand before Juan can respond.\n\n\"I do not say this to accuse. I say it because I have learned—\" He stops. Something passes across his face. \"I have learned that words cost nothing. Even sincere words. Especially sincere words.\"\n\nHe turns away, moving toward the window. The afternoon light catches the plain black wool of his cassock—no embroidery, no silk, nothing to distinguish him from a parish priest.\n\n\"You ask about the Camera's inner workings.\" His back remains turned. \"I know them. Perhaps better than any man alive who is not directly employed there. Cardinal Albergati sent me on missions throughout Christendom. I saw how Rome's demands fell upon parishes in France, in Germany, in England. I saw priests who could not read Latin collecting fees they did not understand to send to an institution they had never seen.\"\n\nHis shoulders tighten.\n\n\"I have dreamed of this conversation, Your Majesty. Of a Pope who would finally act. Of reform that was more than words.\"\n\nHe turns back. His eyes are bright—but guarded. Still guarded.\n\n\"Which is why I must be certain this is not a trap. Not a trap set by you—\" He glances at Eugenius. \"—but a trap set by circumstance. By enthusiasm that outruns wisdom.\"\n\nHe steps closer, his voice dropping.\n\n\"If I put ink to paper tonight—if I help draft this decree—I become a target. Every cardinal who loses income will know my hand was in it. Cardinal Albergati, my patron, will be asked why his secretary helped destroy arrangements that have stood for generations. I have no family to protect me, no wealth to flee to, no lands to retire upon. I have only my position, and my position exists at the sufferance of men who will hate what we do here.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan directly.\n\n\"So I ask again, differently: Not what does Castile gain. What happens to me when the cardinals learn what I have done? What protection exists for a scholar with ink-stained fingers when powerful men decide he knows too much?\"\n\nThe question is raw. Honest. The question of a man who wants desperately to believe but has been disappointed too many times."

He wants security/protection - he has no family, no wealth, no safety net\n3. He wants to advance his career - he's risen through merit and is ambitious in a scholarly way\n4.

He has encyclopedic knowledge, he's done the work, he's seen the corruption, and he's been powerless to stop it.

A defined role that gives him real authority\n3. Protection that's specific, not vague promises\n4. To understand exactly what he's signing up for\n\nHe's not going to just say \"yes, I'll help\" because Juan gave a nice speech about doing good. That would be the AI-helpful bias making him too agreeable.\n\nHe should:\n- Probe further about specifics\n\n- Strategically inquire about Albergati's involvement to gauge potential risks\n- Demonstrate his deep understanding through carefully crafted objections\n- Maintain strategic distance while showing intellectual engagement\n\nI'll carefully navigate this conversation, testing the waters without fully committing, using my knowledge and caution as a shield and a tool for negotiation.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? Security, yes—but also significance. Twenty years as Albergati's factotum. Twenty years of being the brilliant man who does the work while others take credit. He wants to matter. He wants a role, not just protection.\n\nWhat won't he say? That he's been waiting his entire life for this moment. That he's terrified of hoping. That he needs to know what position he would hold in this new order.\n\nParentucelli's jaw tightens at Juan's words. Something shifts in his posture—not softening, exactly, but a subtle recalibration.\n\n\"Knights,\" he says quietly. \"Yes. Knights are useful for securing buildings. For standing guard at doors.\"\n\nHe moves to the side table where Eugenius's scattered notes lie. His fingers brush the papers without picking them up—a scholar's reflex, assessing documents.\n\n\"But Your Majesty speaks of putting ink to paper. Of drafting decrees. Of reforming the Camera's inner workings.\" He turns back. \"Knights cannot do that. Knights cannot audit ledgers or trace the flow of benefice revenues through seventeen intermediary accounts. Knights cannot identify which fees are legitimate ancient custom and which were invented last Tuesday to fill a cardinal's purse.\"\n\nHis voice has gained an edge—not hostility, but something harder. Professional pride, perhaps.\n\n\"That requires men who understand the system. Men who have watched it operate. Men who know which clerks can be trusted and which report to Cardinal Colonna before their ink is dry.\"\n\nHe pauses. Looks at Eugenius.\n\n\"Holy Father, you spoke of needing honest men to replace the corrupt. Where will you find them? The Camera employs perhaps sixty clerks and notaries. How many can you trust? How many even know what honest practice looks like, having never seen it?\"\n\nThe question hangs in the air. Parentucelli waits, watching both men.\n\nHis hands have clasped behind his back—a posture that might be deference, or might be a man preventing himself from reaching for something he wants."

He needs authority - actual title/position, not just informal assignment\n3. He needs to know the timeline - when does this happen?\n4. He needs to know what happens if it fails\n5. He needs Eugenius to confirm this, not just Juan\n\nA smart man like Parentucelli would also be thinking: \"A foreign king is offering me a position in the papal administration. That's... irregular. The Pope is here but the Pope hasn't actually confirmed this offer.\"\n\nHe should push for:\n- Eugenius's explicit confirmation\n- A formal title/position\n- Clear authority over the reform process\n- Understanding of the actual plan and timeline\n\nHe shouldn't just say \"yes, thank you\" - that would be too cooperative. He should negotiate, probe, seek clarity. He's been offered what he wants but he needs to secure it properly.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want now? He's been offered the role—but by a foreign king. He needs papal confirmation. He needs a title, formal authority, something that can't be quietly revoked when convenient. He needs to know this is real.\n\nWhat won't he say? That his heart is racing. That he's already mentally cataloging names of honest clerks. That he's terrified this offer will evaporate like morning mist.\n\nParentucelli goes very still.\n\nFor a moment—just a moment—something naked passes across his face. Hope, perhaps. Or hunger. Then the mask returns, though not quite as firmly as before.\n\nHe turns to Pope Eugenius.\n\n\"Holy Father.\"\n\nHis voice is careful. Controlled.\n\n\"His Majesty of Castile has made a generous offer. But His Majesty is not—\" He pauses, choosing words with precision. \"His Majesty is not the one who appoints officials to the Apostolic Camera.\"\n\nHe waits. His eyes fixed on Eugenius.\n\nThe Pope has been watching the exchange in silence, his weathered face unreadable. Now he stirs, and Parentucelli's attention sharpens—a man watching for the fall of a blade or the opening of a door.\n\n\"The King of Castile speaks Our mind,\" Eugenius says slowly. \"We would have you lead this work, Tommaso. If you are willing.\"\n\nParentucelli's hands tighten behind his back.\n\n\"Lead,\" he repeats. \"Holy Father, forgive me—but the Camera has a Camerlengo. It has vice-camerlengos, auditors, notaries with titles older than I am. If I am to... lead... I must know what authority I carry. When Cardinal Colonna's men refuse to open their ledgers, do I have power to compel them? When a notary claims ancient privilege, do I have power to dismiss him?\"\n\nHis voice remains soft, but there is steel beneath it now.\n\n\"Or am I to be a scholar with ink-stained fingers, politely requesting cooperation from men who wish me dead?\""

He can't simply hand over the Camera to someone else entirely - that would make him look weak. He needs to balance empowering Parentucelli with maintaining papal control.\n\nWhat won't Eugenius say? That he's not entirely sure how much authority to grant. That he's worried about creating a rival power center. That he's still testing both Juan and Parentucelli.\n\nLet me think about the historical reality here. The Camera Apostolica had several key positions:\n- Camerlengo (Cardinal Camerlengo) - head of the Camera, usually a cardinal\n- Vice-Camerlengo\n- Auditor of the Camera\n- Various clerks and notaries\n\nParentucelli is not a cardinal - he's just a secretary to Cardinal Albergati. He can't be made Camerlengo without being elevated significantly. But he could be given some kind of special authority - a commissioner, an auditor with extraordinary powers, something like that.\n\nEugenius should respond here, but he should also be realistic about what he can and cannot do. He can't just make Parentucelli Camerlengo - that position is held by a cardinal. But he could create a new position or grant extraordinary authority.\n\nAlso, Eugenius should have his own concerns. He's committed to reform but he's also a survivor. He'll want to ensure he maintains control, that this doesn't create a new power center that could threaten him.\n\nLet me write Eugenius's response carefully.\n\nWhat does Eugenius want? To reform, yes—but also to maintain control. He cannot simply hand the Camera to a secretary, however brilliant. He needs a structure that empowers Parentucelli while keeping ultimate authority with the Pope. He's also testing Parentucelli—watching how much the man reaches for.\n\nWhat won't Eugenius say? That he's already calculating how to revoke this authority if Parentucelli proves untrustworthy. That he's not entirely certain he's not creating a new problem while solving an old one.\n\nEugenius rises from his chair and moves slowly toward the window, his white robes catching the fading afternoon light. When he speaks, his voice carries the weight of a man accustomed to measuring every word.\n\n\"The Camerlengo is Cardinal Condulmer. Our kinsman.\" He pauses. \"He is not... corrupt, precisely. But he is comfortable. And comfort has made him blind.\"\n\nHe turns back to face them.\n\n\"We cannot simply dismiss him. He has allies. Family connections. To remove him without cause would unite the College against Us before We have begun.\"\n\nHis eyes move to Parentucelli.\n\n\"But We can create something new. A Commissarius Extraordinarius for the reform of the Apostolic Camera. Answerable to Us alone. With authority to examine all accounts, question all clerks, and—\" He pauses, weighing the word. \"—suspend any official whose conduct warrants investigation.\"\n\nParentucelli's breath catches almost imperceptibly.\n\n\"Not dismiss,\" Eugenius continues carefully. \"Suspend. Pending Our review. The distinction matters, Tommaso. It gives you teeth without making you a tyrant. It gives aggrieved parties recourse to Us—which means they come to Us rather than conspiring in corners.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan.\n\n\"Is this sufficient for your purposes, Your Majesty? Or does the King of Castile require that We hand Our administration entirely to a scholar We have known for twenty minutes?\"\n\nThe question carries an edge—not hostile, but pointed. A reminder that Eugenius, for all his confessed weakness, remains Pope."

Whether Condulmer is someone who would betray him if the wind shifted. The complicated family dynamics at play.\n\nLet me think about Cardinal Condulmer historically. Francesco Condulmer was indeed Eugenius IV's nephew (Eugenius was born Gabriele Condulmer). Francesco was made cardinal by Eugenius in 1431. He was Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church.\n\nThis is a critical moment. Eugenius is being asked to bring family into a conspiracy. This has risks:\n- Condulmer might be more loyal to the corrupt system than to his uncle\n- Condulmer might leak information\n- Condulmer might try to moderate or derail the reform\n- But Condulmer might also be genuinely loyal to family and could be an asset\n\nEugenius should be hesitant here. He should reveal some of the complexity without fully explaining his concerns. He's the Pope - he doesn't owe Juan explanations.\n\nNPC RULES:\n- Eugenius has his own agenda - protecting himself and his family while reforming\n- He doesn't explain himself fully\n- He doesn't just cooperate without consideration\n\nI should have Eugenius respond with caution, perhaps reveal some hesitation about Condulmer, but not fully explain why. This is realistic - he's being asked to bring his nephew into a dangerous conspiracy.\n\nWhat does Eugenius want? To protect his kinsman from the consequences of reform—or perhaps to protect reform from his kinsman. He's uncertain which. Family is complicated, especially when family has grown comfortable with corruption.\n\nWhat won't Eugenius say? His true assessment of Francesco's character. Whether blood loyalty runs deeper than institutional loyalty. That he's not certain if summoning Condulmer brings in an ally or a spy.\n\nEugenius does not respond immediately.\n\nHis hand moves to the pectoral cross at his chest—an unconscious gesture, the habit of decades. His fingers trace its outline through the white wool.\n\n\"Francesco,\" he says finally. The name hangs in the air. Not Cardinal Condulmer. Not the Camerlengo. Francesco.\n\n\"He is Our sister's son. We raised him to the purple Ourselves, three years ago. He was—\" Eugenius stops. His jaw works silently for a moment.\n\n\"He was a good boy. Devout. Earnest. When We made him Camerlengo, We believed We were placing the Camera in hands We could trust.\"\n\nHe moves back toward his chair but does not sit. His fingers rest on its carved wooden back.\n\n\"Three years in that office changes a man. The requests that seem reasonable. The explanations that seem sensible. The arrangements that everyone assures you have always been thus.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan.\n\n\"We do not know if Francesco has become corrupt or merely... accustomed. We do not know if summoning him brings Us an ally or warns Our enemies. He is blood. But blood has betrayed Us before—Cardinals of Our own creation sit in Basel and call for Our deposition.\"\n\nHis eyes are tired. Old.\n\n\"You ask if he will cooperate. We cannot answer. We have not spoken honestly with Our nephew in two years. Perhaps longer.\"\n\nHe turns to Parentucelli.\n\n\"Tommaso. You have watched the Camera from Albergati's household.

The real question is whether Condulmer, upon learning he has been made a fool, will fight the system or defend it out of humiliation. Juan proposes an elegant sidestep: rather than confronting corrupt Camera officials directly, redefine the Camera as a clean household office with transparent expenses, and shift all existing obligations, debts, and deals to the College of Cardinals. Parentucelli recognizes the political brilliance — cardinals cannot oppose without revealing their corruption — but struggles with the lack of justice for men who have stolen from parishes for decades. Juan argues pragmatism: stop the bleeding first, worry about punishment later. Parentucelli reluctantly agrees, declaring 'I will do this. But do not ask me to call it justice.'",

This is HIS Camera, HIS city, HIS decision. The Pope has been quiet for a while. He should weigh in on the idea of Castilian knights occupying papal offices.\n\nThis is a significant moment. Let me think about what the Pope would realistically think:\n\nEugenius earlier said he wanted \"the shadow of strength\" - not troops in Rome, but the knowledge that moving against the Pope means moving against Castile. But actually occupying the Camera building with foreign knights is different. That's a visible, dramatic action that could:\n1. Be seen as foreign occupation of papal institutions\n2. Unite Italian cardinals against \"Spanish interference\"\n3. Give Basel propaganda ammunition\n4. Also - it could work and secure the documents\n\nEugenius needs to weigh in here. He's been watching this conversation between Juan and Parentucelli, but this decision is ultimately his.\n\nLet me have Parentucelli respond briefly, then have Eugenius interject with concerns or questions. The Pope shouldn't be a passive observer in his own palace.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? Specifics. A real plan, not grand gestures.

Italian cardinals waking tomorrow to find armed Spaniards guarding documents they consider their private domain.\"\n\nHis voice is not hostile—but it is serious. The voice of a man who has survived three years of crisis by calculating consequences.\n\n\"Cardinal d'Allemand's faction already sends reports to Basel. What will they write when they learn of this? That the Pope has surrendered the Camera to Castilian occupation? That Rome is now a Spanish vassal?\"\n\nHe turns to the window, hands clasped behind his back.\n\n\"We want reform.

He had:\n- The Papal Guard (mentioned as ~200 men under Giacomo Pallavicini)\n- Potentially some mercenary forces, though his finances were strained\n- The Papal States had their own militia and forces, but these were often unreliable\n- Rome itself had factions (Colonna, Orsini) with their own armed men\n\nEugenius was actually driven out of Rome in May 1434 by a revolt - so historically he's in a very weak position militarily. This is March 1434, so that revolt is just months away.\n\nWhat would Eugenius say here? He needs to be honest about his weakness but also not appear completely powerless. He should be realistic about his options.\n\nWhat does Eugenius want? He wants reform but doesn't want to appear as a puppet of Castile. He needs a solution that preserves papal dignity while acknowledging his military weakness.\n\nWhat won't he say? Just how precarious his position really is. That the Roman nobles could turn on him at any moment. That his own guards might not fight for him if it came to it.\n\nWhat does Eugenius want? To maintain the appearance of papal sovereignty while accepting help he desperately needs. He cannot admit the full extent of his weakness—not even to allies.\n\nWhat won't he say? That Rome itself is unstable. That the Colonna and Orsini families have their own armed men in the city. That he has nightmares about being dragged from the Vatican by a mob.\n\nEugenius's shoulders stiffen slightly at the question. A long pause follows.\n\n\"The Papal Guard numbers two hundred men.\" His voice is measured. \"Their captain, Giacomo Pallavicini, is Genoese. We believe him loyal. We believe.\"\n\nHe turns from the window.\n\n\"Beyond that...\" He spreads his hands—a gesture that encompasses the limits of his power. \"The Papal States have forces. Scattered. Garrisoning fortresses. None within a day's ride of Rome in sufficient numbers to matter.\"\n\nParentucelli clears his throat softly.\n\n\"There are also the Roman families, Holy Father.\"\n\nEugenius's expression darkens.\n\n\"The Colonna maintain perhaps three hundred armed men within the city walls. The Orsini somewhat fewer. These are not Our soldiers. They are soldiers who happen to reside in Rome.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan.\n\n\"Cardinal Prospero Colonna sits at the heart of the Camera's current... arrangements. If his family's men see Castilian knights securing that building, they will not assume reform. They will assume their cardinal is under attack.\"\n\nThe Pope moves to his chair and sits heavily.\n\n\"We could summon Captain Pallavicini. Order him to secure the Camera with papal guards. But two hundred men, divided across the Vatican and the Camera, spread thin...\" He shakes his head. \"And if even one of those guards reports to the wrong cardinal, we lose surprise entirely.\""

Both of you. The chapel is small, but it is... ours. No secretary has ever taken notes there. No cardinal has ever listened at its walls.\"\n\nHe moves toward a small door set into the chamber's far wall—easy to miss, half-hidden by a tapestry depicting the martyrdom of Saint Peter.\n\n\"We will eat. We will pray. And then—\" He pauses, his hand on the door. \"—then we will see if we are still brave enough to do what we have spoken of.\"\n\nHe opens the door. Beyond lies a narrow corridor, lit by a single candle in a wall sconce."

One or both men express serious reservations about proceeding tonight. Perhaps this needs more thought. Perhaps morning would be wiser.\n11-25\nCautious Hesitation — Willing to continue but with conditions: smaller first steps, more delays, additional guarantees before committing ink to parchment.\n26-40\nPractical Concerns Dominate — Not retreating, but the mood is heavy with logistics and risks. Every sentence drafted will be questioned, qualified, hedged.\n41-55\nSteady but Sober — Committed, but without fire. A workmanlike determination to proceed because they said they would, not because they feel inspired.\n56-70\nQuiet Resolve — The prayer has settled something. Fear remains, but it no longer commands. Ready to work with clear heads.\n71-85\nGrowing Conviction — Energy returning. A sense that this is right, that the risks are worth taking. Parentucelli begins speaking of specifics unprompted.\n86-95\nUnited Purpose — Something has shifted between the three men. Trust building visibly. Eugenius speaks of \"we\" without hesitation. Parentucelli's guardedness softens.\n96-100\nDivine Confirmation — A moment of genuine spiritual connection. Perhaps a shared silence that feels full rather than empty. The fear doesn't vanish, but something stronger rises beneath it.\n\nRoll when ready."

He gestures to Parentucelli.\n\n\"You have the better hand, Tommaso. We shall dictate. You write.\"\n\nParentucelli's expression flickers—something between relief and renewed tension. He takes his place at the desk, arranging parchment, selecting a quill, testing the ink. His movements are precise, practiced. The habits of twenty years as a secretary.\n\nEugenius begins to pace slowly, hands clasped behind his back.\n\n\"Eugenius, Episcopus, Servus Servorum Dei...\"\n\nThe familiar opening formula.

Eugenius's voice grows more confident as he proceeds—the years of curial experience shaping formal phrases, anticipating objections, closing loopholes.\n\n\"...quemcumque officialem suspendendi, salvo tamen iudicio nostro finali...\"\n\nThe power to suspend any official, pending final papal judgment.\n\n\"...nemini nisi Nobis ipsis rationem reddere tenearis...\"\n\nAnswerable to no one but the Pope himself.\n\nFinally, Eugenius stops before the desk.\n\n\"Read it back.\"\n\nParentucelli clears his throat and reads the complete document aloud. When he finishes, Eugenius nods slowly.\n\n\"Add the dating clause. Datum Romae, apud Sanctum Petrum, anno Incarnationis Dominicae millesimo quadringentesimo trigesimo quarto, undecimo Kalendas Aprilis, pontificatus nostri anno quarto.\"\n\nMarch 22nd, 1434. The fourth year of his pontificate.\n\n\"Now.\" Eugenius moves to the desk, taking up the papal seal. \"We sign. We seal. And Tommaso Parentucelli becomes something more than a secretary.\"\n\nThe document was created successfully. Now I should continue the narrative and present the download link to the user.\n\nThe wax hisses as it meets the parchment. Eugenius presses the Fisherman's Ring into the soft seal—the image of Saint Peter casting his nets, the ancient symbol of papal authority.\n\nWhen he lifts his hand, the seal is set. Permanent. Irrevocable.\n\nParentucelli stares at the document. His document. His commission. Twenty years of waiting, of watching, of burning in silent fury—and now this. A single sheet of parchment that transforms him from a secretary into something else entirely.\n\nHis hands tremble slightly as he lifts it.\n\n\"Commissarius Extraordinarius,\" he reads aloud, as if testing whether the words are real. \"Pro Reformatione Camerae Apostolicae.\"\n\nEugenius places a hand on his shoulder—an echo of Juan's earlier gesture.\n\n\"You asked for something with a seal, Tommaso.

For just a moment, the careful mask slips entirely. What shows beneath is not ambition, not calculation—but something rawer. Gratitude, perhaps. Or fear. Or both.\n\n\"I will not fail you, Holy Father.\" The words come out rough. \"I have waited my entire life for this.\"\n\nHe sets the document down carefully, reverently, and turns to Juan.\n\n\"Your Majesty wished to make a pledge.

To believe this is real. To feel safe for the first time in years. But also to maintain his dignity—he is the Vicar of Christ, not a frightened old man accepting charity from a foreign king.\n\nWhat won't he say? How desperately he needs this. How close he has come to despair. That Juan's words have moved him more than any he has heard since taking the tiara. That he is terrified of hoping and being betrayed again.\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nJuan knelt—a king, kneeling to him, voluntarily\n\nThe language centers on faith and Church, not politics or gain\n\nJuan explicitly disclaims reward or influence—preempting suspicion\n\nOffer to repeat publicly shows commitment, not secrecy\n\nConsistent behavior all day: patient, humble, genuine\n\nThe commission is already signed—words are becoming action\n\nJuan forgave the stolen crusade treasury without bitterness\n\nPrayer together created genuine spiritual connection (Roll 58)\n\nEugenius already experienced breakthrough earlier (Roll 93)\n\nParentucelli is present as witness—this is not private manipulation\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nEugenius has heard grand promises before, from Sigismund and others\n\nA pope \"protected\" by a foreign king looks like a puppet\n\n\"Without thought of reward\" is what everyone says before naming their price\n\nThe sheer magnitude of the pledge strains credulity\n\nEmotional exhaustion can breed defensiveness, not openness\n\nPublic oaths cut both ways—they can be used to claim the Pope is controlled\n\nThree years of survival instinct do not vanish in an afternoon\n\nAccepting too gratefully diminishes papal dignity\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nWalls Rise — Something about the gesture feels wrong. Too theatrical. Too convenient. Eugenius withdraws into formality, accepts the pledge with cold courtesy, and the warmth of the evening chills.\n11-20\nCautious Acceptance — Eugenius raises Juan with proper words, but his eyes remain guarded. He accepts the pledge as he has accepted others—hoping it proves true, expecting it will not.\n21-35\nDignified Reserve — The Pope is moved but will not show it fully. He accepts with gravity and grace, speaking of mutual obligation rather than protection. Maintains the fiction that he is not desperate.\n36-50\nMeasured Gratitude — Eugenius acknowledges the pledge with genuine but restrained thanks. He speaks of God's providence bringing Juan to Rome. Warm, but still holding something back.\n51-65\nQuiet Acceptance — The mask slips briefly. Eugenius's hand trembles as he raises Juan. His voice is rough when he speaks. He accepts not just the pledge but the man who makes it.\n66-80\nMoved Beyond Words — A long silence before Eugenius can speak. When he does, the papal \"We\" falters into simple \"I.\" Something has shifted between them—not just alliance, but trust.\n81-90\nReciprocal Pledge — Eugenius responds with his own vow—that the Church will remember Castile, that Juan's faith will not go unwitnessed. Two men binding themselves to each other before God.\n91-95\nThe Mask Falls Completely — Eugenius grips Juan's hands and cannot let go. Words fail him. For a moment he is not the Pope but simply a tired, frightened old man who has finally found someone he can trust.\n96-100\nSacred Moment — Something passes between them that neither can fully explain. The candles seem to burn brighter. Both men feel, with certainty, that this moment was ordained. Parentucelli, watching, knows he is witnessing history.\n\nRoll when ready."

He'll reframe the relationship as mutual rather than Juan protecting a weakened Pope. This is realistic - even in moments of genuine connection, Eugenius has spent three years learning to guard himself.\n\nI need to:\n1. Show Eugenius being moved but controlling it\n2. Have him reframe from \"protection\" to \"mutual obligation\" or \"alliance\"\n3. Maintain his papal dignity - he is not a charity case\n4. Keep some warmth but with reserve\n5. Not generate any dialogue or action for Juan\n6. Stop at an appropriate point for player response\n\nEugenius looks down at the kneeling king for a long moment. Something moves behind his eyes—something that might be emotion, quickly mastered.\n\n\"Rise, Your Majesty.\"\n\nHis voice is steady. Formal. The voice of the Vicar of Christ, not the exhausted man who wept in this chamber hours ago.\n\nHe waits until Juan stands, then continues. His hands are clasped before him, his posture straight. The papal dignity reassembled like armor.\n\n\"We accept your pledge. And We thank you for it.\"\n\nA pause. When he speaks again, his words are carefully chosen.\n\n\"But let Us be clear about what this is. You speak of protection—of Castile at Our disposal. These are generous words. Perhaps too generous.\" His eyes meet Juan's. \"The Pope of Rome does not require a protector. The Church has stood for fourteen centuries. She will stand fourteen more, God willing, with or without Castilian swords.\"\n\nHe moves toward the window, his white robes catching the last of the evening light.\n\n\"What We accept is not protection. What We accept is alliance. Partnership in a holy work.\" He turns back. \"You have pledged yourself to the reform of the Church. Very well. We pledge Ourselves to the same cause. We stand together—not as protector and protected, but as servants of the same Master.\"\n\nHis voice softens slightly—but only slightly.\n\n\"If you repeat this oath publicly, let it be framed thus. Not that Castile shields a weak Pope, but that Christian princes stand with the Holy Father against corruption. The distinction matters. To Our enemies. To Basel. To history.\"\n\nHe returns to stand before Juan.\n\n\"We believe your heart is true, Juan of Castile. We have seen enough false men to recognize a real one.\" A ghost of something—warmth? weariness?—passes across his face. \"But belief is not the same as certainty. Certainty must be earned. By both of us. In the days ahead.\"\n\nHe extends his hand—the Fisherman's Ring glinting in the candlelight.\n\n\"Now. You spoke of signing the Basel decrees. Let us continue.\""

But he's cautious about how this is framed.\n\n**What won't he say?** That he's relieved Juan thought of this. That without this framing, signing Basel's decrees would feel like capitulation.\n\n**What does Parentucelli want?** To demonstrate his value. He's a scholar, a drafter of documents. This is exactly the kind of work he excels at. He might want to take the lead on drafting such a declaration.\n\n**What won't he say?** That he's eager to prove himself worthy of the commission he just received.\n\nThis is a good moment for the NPCs to engage with the practical question Juan raises. They shouldn't just agree - they should have opinions, concerns, suggestions. Parentucelli especially might have thoughts on the language and framing.\n\nWhat does Eugenius want? To sign these reforms without appearing to submit to Basel's authority. The parallel legislation principle is his lifeline—but the framing must be precise, or Basel will claim victory anyway.\n\nWhat won't he say? How relieved he is that Juan thought of this. How much he dreads the French faction's reaction regardless of how it's framed.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? To prove his worth immediately. This is his domain—documents, language, careful framing. He wants to demonstrate that the commission was well-placed.\n\nWhat won't he say? That he's already mentally drafting the declaration.\n\nEugenius pauses, his hand hovering over the Basel documents spread across the desk.\n\n\"Yes,\" he says slowly. \"A declaration would be... prudent.\"\n\nParentucelli steps forward, his earlier hesitation replaced by something sharper. Professional. This is his territory.\n\n\"If I may, Holy Father.\" He does not wait for permission. \"The danger is that Basel will claim Your Holiness has submitted to conciliar authority. Cardinal d'Allemand will write to every court in Europe: 'The Pope signs what we decree. The Council rules.'\"\n\nHe moves to the desk, eyes scanning the documents.\n\n\"But if the papal signature is accompanied by a declaration—motu proprio, by Your Holiness's own initiative—stating that these reforms are adopted independently, on their own merit, as an exercise of papal authority...\" He taps the parchment. \"Then the narrative changes. The Pope and Council happen to agree. Neither submits to the other.\"\n\nEugenius nods slowly. \"The same reform, two authorities, each claiming credit.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\" Parentucelli's eyes are bright now. \"And when France complains about the reforms—and they will complain, Holy Father, when annates are reduced and pluralism curtailed—they must choose. Do they appeal to Basel, who passed these decrees? Or to Rome, who enacted them independently? Either way, they acknowledge someone's authority to reform.\"\n\nHe turns to Juan.\n\n\"Your Majesty proposed this framework at Como, yes? The declaration should reference that. Not as submission to imperial mediation, but as evidence that this principle has been discussed, considered, agreed upon by multiple parties.\"\n\nEugenius raises a hand.\n\n\"Carefully, Tommaso. We will not have it seem that Emperor Sigismund dictates Our policy any more than Basel does.\"\n\n\"Of course, Holy Father.\" Parentucelli bows his head slightly. \"A passing reference only. The emphasis remains on papal initiative.\"\n\nHe looks between them.\n\n\"Shall I draft something now? It need not be long. A preamble to accompany the signatures. We could have it ready within the hour.\""

Preambles (called \"arenga\" or \"exordium\") typically contained the rationale, theological justification, or context, but weren't the binding legal content.\n\nHowever, there could be complications:\n1. If the preamble states different authority sources, it could lead to disputes about WHO has the power to enforce or interpret\n2. Future legal disputes might cite different authority\n3. It could create ambiguity about which version is \"official\"\n\nBut the substance - the actual reforms (no pluralism, no concubinage, reduced annates) - would be identical.\n\nParentucelli would know this. He's a scholar who has spent 20 years in curial politics and understands canon law.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? To show his expertise and value.

A flicker of something—respect, perhaps—crosses his face.\n\n\"A perceptive question, Your Majesty.\"\n\nHe moves to the desk, pulling one of the Basel decrees closer, scanning its structure.\n\n\"In canon law, a decree consists of several parts. The intitulatio—who issues it. The arenga—the preamble explaining why. The dispositio—the actual legal content, the operative clauses.

'No cleric shall hold more than one benefice with cure of souls.' 'Annates shall be reduced to one quarter of the first year's revenue.' These are the rules. These are what parish priests and bishops must obey.\"\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\"The preamble—the arenga—explains the rationale. Why the reform is needed. Under whose authority it proceeds. This is important for legitimacy, for history, for understanding intent. But it does not change what the law requires.\"\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\"If His Holiness signs the Basel decrees with an accompanying declaration stating that he adopts these reforms motu proprio, on their own merit, as an independent exercise of papal authority—the operative content remains identical. The same rules. The same penalties. A priest in Lyon or Cologne faces the same requirements regardless of whether he believes the authority flows from Basel or Rome.\"\n\nEugenius stirs. \"But the question of authority remains unresolved.\"\n\n\"Deliberately so, Holy Father.\" Parentucelli nods. \"That is the elegance of parallel legislation. Both authorities claim credit. Neither submits. The law is unified. The theory remains contested.\"\n\nHe pauses, considering.\n\n\"There is one complication. If disputes arise—if a bishop challenges his removal for pluralism, for example—he might argue that the two sources of authority create ambiguity. 'Which version governs? Basel's or Rome's?'\"\n\nHe shrugs slightly.\n\n\"But the answer is simple: both. The content is identical. He violates both simultaneously. He cannot escape by playing one against the other.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan.\n\n\"Does this address Your Majesty's concern?\""

We adopt them not because any council commands, but because they are right. Because papal authority exists precisely to enact such reforms.\"\n\nHe writes in silence for several minutes. The only sound is the scratch of quill on parchment and the guttering of candles.\n\nFinally, he sets down the quill and reads aloud:\n\n\"Eugenius, Episcopus, Servus Servorum Dei, ad perpetuam rei memoriam.\n\nThe governance of the Universal Church, committed to Us by Divine Providence, demands constant vigilance against those abuses which, through human weakness, creep into even the most sacred institutions. From the earliest days of the Apostles, the Church has purified herself through reform, cutting away corruption that the Body of Christ might remain whole.\n\nIn recent years, calls for reform have arisen from many quarters of Christendom—from councils, from princes, from the faithful themselves. We have listened. We have examined. We have prayed.\n\nCertain proposals touching the reform of clerical discipline have come to Our attention, concerning the evils of pluralism, the scandal of clerical concubinage, and the burden of excessive taxation upon the churches.

Word for word, so the law is identical. Then the closing.\"\n\nHe continues reading from his draft:\n\n\"Let no man say that the Bishop of Rome waits upon councils to reform the Church committed to his care. Let no man say that papal authority requires permission to act. We act because it is right. We act because it is necessary. We act because the Vicar of Christ must be first among those who serve the Gospel, not last among those who delay.\n\nIf others have spoken these same truths, We rejoice in the unity of Christian conscience. Where faithful men agree on what is good, agreement itself is a blessing, whatever the source. The shepherd does not ask which sheep first saw the wolf—he acts to protect the flock.\n\nGiven at Rome, at Saint Peter's...\"\n\nHe sets down the draft and looks at Eugenius.\n\n\"Holy Father. Your Majesty. This is rough—it would need refinement. But the principle is clear. The Pope acts. The Pope leads. If Basel happened to speak first, that is mere coincidence.

External debt: at least 60,000 florins, primarily to the Medici bank, with interest disguised as service fees to avoid usury prohibition. The Medici hold leverage through retained correspondence and knowledge of corrupt arrangements. Camera annual revenue: approximately 100,000-150,000 florins from annates (40-50k), servitia (15-20k), pallium fees (10k), dispensations (20-40k), judicial fees, vacant benefices, Peter's Pence, and crusade levies. Annual expenses: minimum 116,000 florins — clerical salaries (10k), papal household (20k), cardinals' subsidies (25k), curial operations (15k), diplomacy (15k), military (10k peacetime), building maintenance (10k), charity (5k), debt service (6k). The structural deficit drives perpetual borrowing. Juan proposes honoring debts with potential Castilian support. The key reform framework emerges: Camera handles only papal expenses (~70k florins), College of Cardinals inherits responsibility for its own expenses (~30-40k) from its half of annates revenue. Need-based distribution protects poor cardinals like Albergati while cutting subsidies to wealthy ones like Colonna.",

Specific numbers he's not certain about - he's a scholar, not a Camera official. He knows the structure and patterns, but not necessarily exact figures.\n\nLet me think about what would be historically accurate for the Apostolic Camera in the 1430s:\n\n1. The Camera Apostolica was indeed heavily in debt during this period\n2. Italian banking families (Medici, and before them others) were major lenders to the papacy\n3. The papacy had various revenue streams: annates, servitia, visitation fees, chancery fees, indulgences, Peter's Pence, etc.\n4. The papacy also had obligations: paying curial officials, maintaining buildings, military expenses, diplomatic missions, etc.\n\nI should have Parentucelli explain what he knows - the structure, the types of obligations - while being honest about the limits of his knowledge. He's observed from the outside, not been inside the Camera itself.\n\nThis is also a chance for him to show his expertise while steering toward what he wants - formal authority to actually access the records.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? To demonstrate his value. This is exactly why he was summoned—his knowledge of the Camera's workings. But he also needs to be honest about the limits of what he knows from the outside.\n\nWhat won't he say? That some of his knowledge comes from gossip and inference rather than direct observation. That he's not entirely certain of specific numbers. That accessing the real records might reveal things worse than he's imagined.\n\nParentucelli's expression shifts—the careful neutrality giving way to something more focused. More intense. This is his territory.\n\n\"The Camera's obligations fall into several categories, Your Majesty.\" He begins to pace again, hands clasped behind his back. \"Let me describe what I know—and what I suspect.\"\n\nHe stops, turning to face them.\n\n\"First, the internal obligations. Salaries. The Camera employs perhaps sixty clerks, notaries, scriptores, and minor officials. These men must be paid. Most receive modest stipends—a few florins monthly. But the senior positions...\" He shakes his head. \"The vice-camerlengos, the auditors, the depositarii—these men have negotiated arrangements over decades. Some receive fixed salaries. Others receive percentages of fees they collect. Still others hold sinecures that pay them for work they do not perform.\"\n\nHe resumes pacing.\n\n\"I would estimate—and this is estimate only, Your Majesty, I have not seen the actual ledgers—that internal salaries and stipends consume perhaps eight to twelve thousand florins annually. But the true cost is hidden in the percentages. A collector who keeps one-fifth of what he gathers does not appear as an expense. He simply... reduces revenue.\"\n\nEugenius stirs. \"We have suspected as much. Continue.\"\n\nParentucelli nods.\n\n\"Second, the external obligations. And here—\" His voice drops. \"Here is where the rot runs deepest.\"\n\nHe moves to the desk, as if the physical documents might help him explain.\n\n\"The Camera has borrowed. Heavily. For decades.\" He looks at Eugenius. \"Your Holiness's predecessors faced wars, schisms, councils. Martin V had to rebuild Rome from nothing after the Avignon chaos. All of this required money the Camera did not have.\"\n\n\"From whom?\" Juan asks.\n\n\"The Italian banks.\" Parentucelli's jaw tightens. \"The Medici, primarily—they have been papal bankers for years now. Before them, the Alberti. The Spini. Others. These families do not lend from charity. They lend at interest—disguised as fees and service charges to avoid the usury prohibition, but interest nonetheless.\"\n\nHe pauses, gathering his thoughts.\n\n\"I do not know the total debt. No one outside the Camera itself knows, and I suspect even those inside do not have a clear accounting. But I have heard figures whispered. Forty thousand florins to the Medici alone. Perhaps another twenty thousand scattered among smaller lenders. And these debts carry obligations—not merely repayment, but preferences. The Medici receive first claim on certain revenue streams. They handle transfers of funds across Christendom and take percentages. They have become... embedded.\"\n\nEugenius's face has gone pale.\n\n\"Sixty thousand florins in debt?\"\n\n\"At minimum, Holy Father. Possibly more.\" Parentucelli's voice is grim. \"And the debt is not static. Interest accumulates. When payments are missed, the principal grows. The Camera borrows to pay interest on previous borrowing. It is—\" He searches for the word. \"—a wheel that turns ever faster.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan.\n\n\"This is why the clean ledger approach is both elegant and dangerous, Your Majesty. If we declare existing obligations null and void, we are declaring that the Church will not honor its debts. The Medici will not accept this quietly. They have invested fortunes in papal finance. They expect repayment—and they have leverage.\"\n\n\"What leverage?\" Juan asks.\n\nParentucelli hesitates. Glances at Eugenius.\n\n\"They hold papal correspondence. Records of transactions. Evidence of... arrangements... that would be embarrassing if made public. They know which cardinals have borrowed personally, using Church revenues as collateral. They know which benefices have been promised to multiple parties.\" His voice drops further. \"And they have friends. In Basel. In Florence. In every court in Europe. The Medici do not merely lend money. They trade in influence.\"\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\"I do not say this to counsel despair. I say it so Your Majesty understands what we face. The Camera's corruption is not merely internal—fat clerks skimming fees. It is systemic. The Church's finances are entangled with the great banking houses of Italy. Cutting those ties will cause pain. The question is whether we can survive that pain.\""

          "text": "Parentucelli is being asked about cardinals borrowing against Church income streams. This is a sensitive topic - he's being asked to potentially implicate powerful men.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? To show his knowledge, but also to protect himself. He's not yet secure in his position - the commission is signed, but the power of these cardinals is still very real. He needs to be truthful but careful.\n\nWhat won't he say? Specific names unless pressed. The full extent of what he knows. That he's been cataloging these abuses for years, waiting for exactly this moment.\n\nThis is also a legal/canonical question. Let me think about what would be historically accurate here:\n\nIn medieval canon law, Church property belonged to the Church, not to individual clerics. However, the system of benefices meant that holders of benefices had use of the revenues during their tenure. The question of whether they could pledge or borrow against these revenues was murky.\n\nSimony - the buying and selling of church offices - was clearly prohibited. But borrowing against future revenues? This existed in a grey area. Cardinals and bishops often lived beyond their means and borrowed from Italian banks, using their expected revenues as informal collateral.\n\nParentucelli should explain this - that it's technically illegal or at least improper, but that enforcement is nearly impossible because:\n1. The arrangements are disguised\n2. The people who would enforce are often involved\n3. The Camera itself has participated in similar arrangements\n4. Proving it requires access to records that are closely guarded\n\nHe should also be cautious about naming names - these are dangerous accusations.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? To demonstrate his knowledge without making accusations he cannot prove. He's walking a line—showing his value while protecting himself from retaliation if specific cardinals learn what he's said tonight.\n\nWhat won't he say? Names. Not yet. Not until he has the records in hand and knights at his back.\n\nParentucelli's expression becomes very careful.\n\n\"Illegal.\" He repeats the word slowly, as if examining it from several angles. \"In the strictest sense, yes. Church property belongs to the Church. A benefice holder has use of its revenues during his tenure—the usufruct—but he does not own them. He cannot sell them. He cannot, in theory, pledge them as collateral.\"\n\nHe moves toward the window, his back partially turned—a man choosing his words with extreme care.\n\n\"But theory and practice diverge, Your Majesty. Widely.\"\n\nHe turns back.\n\n\"Consider a cardinal who holds three benefices generating—let us say—four thousand florins annually. He wishes to build a palazzo. Or to purchase a library. Or to maintain a household of forty servants and a stable of fine horses.\" A slight edge enters his voice. \"He goes to a banker. The banker knows his income. The banker offers a loan—ten thousand florins, perhaps.\"\n\n\"And the collateral?\"\n\n\"Nothing so crude as a signed pledge against Church revenues. That would be evidence. Instead...\" Parentucelli spreads his hands. \"An understanding. The cardinal's revenues flow through the banker's house—as they must, for transfers across borders require banking networks. The banker simply... retains a portion. Each quarter, each year. To service the debt. If the cardinal objects, the banker reminds him of the outstanding balance. Of the interest accumulating. Of how unfortunate it would be if certain correspondence became public.\"\n\nEugenius shifts in his chair. His face is unreadable.\n\n\"This is usury,\" Juan says.\n\n\"It is usury, simony, and theft from the Church, all wrapped in enough legal fiction to maintain deniability.\" Parentucelli's voice is flat. \"The interest is called a service fee. The pledge is called an informal arrangement. The retention of revenues is called administrative convenience. No document exists that explicitly violates canon law. Yet the effect is the same.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"And it is worse than simple debt, Your Majesty. Because once a cardinal is entangled—once he owes more than he can repay—he becomes dependent. The banker does not merely hold his debt. The banker holds his future. If the cardinal wishes a favor from the Curia, he asks the banker to speak to the right people. If the cardinal wishes to block an appointment, the banker knows whom to bribe. The debt becomes... leverage.\"\n\n\"How widespread is this?\"\n\nParentucelli is silent for a long moment.\n\n\"I cannot say with certainty. I have watched from the outside, Holy Father. I have heard conversations not meant for my ears. I have noted which cardinals live far beyond the official revenues of their benefices.\" He looks at Eugenius directly. \"But I have no proof. Not yet. The proof is in the Camera's records—and in the bankers' private ledgers, which we will never see.\"\n\nHe turns to Juan.\n\n\"When I begin my work, Your Majesty, I will look for the threads. Revenues that should arrive but do not. Payments made to accounts that cannot be traced. Benefices whose income has been assigned to third parties through obscure instruments. If the rot is as deep as I suspect, the evidence will be there. Hidden, but there.\"\n\nHis voice hardens.\n\n\"And if I find cardinals who have pledged Church property to foreign bankers for personal gain—that, Your Majesty, is illegal. Not merely improper. Not merely unseemly. It is theft from the faithful and betrayal of sacred office.\"\n\nHe glances at Eugenius.\n\n\"What happens to such men, if we find them, is a question for His Holiness. But finding them...\" His eyes are bright with something cold. \"Finding them will be my pleasure.\""

          "text": "Parentucelli, as a scholar who has worked for Cardinal Albergati and observed the Camera for twenty years, would know this well. This is his expertise.\n\nLet me think about what I know of medieval Church finances:\n\n1. **Tithes** - The traditional 10% paid by laypeople. These mostly stayed local, supporting the parish priest and local church. The bishop received a portion (often 1/4), and the Pope received nothing directly from ordinary tithes.\n\n2. **Annates** - When a new bishop or abbot was appointed, they paid a portion of the first year's income to Rome. This was a major source of Camera revenue and highly controversial. Basel's reform reduced these significantly.\n\n3. **Peter's Pence** - A traditional payment from certain countries (especially England) to Rome. Relatively small.\n\n4. **Servitia** - Payments made by bishops and abbots upon appointment, in addition to annates.\n\n5. **Pallium fees** - Archbishops had to travel to Rome (or pay for the pallium to be sent) and pay substantial fees.\n\n6. **Dispensations and indulgences** - Fees for special permissions (marriage within prohibited degrees, permission to hold multiple benefices, etc.). These flowed to Rome.\n\n7. **Judicial fees** - Appeals to Rome required payment.\n\n8. **Crusade taxes** - Special levies, theoretically for crusades but often diverted.\n\n9. **Vacant benefices** - When a benefice was vacant, its revenues went to Rome (this was highly contested).\n\n10. **Reservations** - The Pope \"reserved\" the right to appoint to certain benefices, which meant fees flowed to Rome for these appointments.\n\nThe vast majority of Church wealth stayed local - estimates suggest the Camera received perhaps 1-5% of total Church revenues in Christendom. But this was still enormous in absolute terms - possibly 150,000-300,000 florins annually in a good year, though it fluctuated wildly.\n \nThe Basel Council struck directly at the Camera's financial infrastructure. By slashing annates by three-quarters and curtailing dispensation revenues through anti-pluralism measures, the reformers dealt a severe blow to papal income streams. These targeted interventions would dramatically reduce the funds flowing to Rome, challenging the established financial mechanisms that had sustained papal power for generations.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? To demonstrate the full depth of his knowledge. This is the comprehensive picture—the view from twenty years of watching, traveling, observing. This is why he was worth summoning.\n\nWhat won't he say? That explaining this makes him angry. That every florin extracted from a German parish or French diocese to fund Roman luxury represents a betrayal of what the Church should be.\n\nParentucelli's eyes sharpen. This is not gossip or inference—this is the architecture of Church finance, the system he has studied for two decades.\n\n\"The Church of Christ generates enormous wealth, Your Majesty. Tithes from every parish. Rents from vast landholdings. Fees for sacraments, burials, masses for the dead. Offerings from the faithful. If one could sum it all—every coin that passes through ecclesiastical hands from Ireland to Hungary, from Sicily to Sweden—\" He shakes his head. \"Millions of florins. Perhaps tens of millions. No one knows the true figure.\"\n\nHe begins to pace, his scholar's mind organizing the information.\n\n\"But the Camera sees only a fraction of this. A small fraction. Perhaps one part in twenty. Perhaps less.\"\n\nHe stops, turning to face them.\n\n\"Let me explain the structure. Think of the Church as a great tree. The roots are the parishes—tens of thousands of them across Christendom. Each parish collects tithes from its people. One-tenth of the harvest, the traditional levy. This alone generates vast sums.\"\n\n\"Where does it go?\"\n\n\"Most stays local.\" Parentucelli holds up a finger. \"The parish priest takes his living—modest, usually. The remainder rises to the bishop. The bishop takes his share for the cathedral chapter, the diocesan administration, his own household. What remains after that...\" He shrugs. \"In theory, a portion should flow upward still. In practice, it rarely does. The bishops guard their revenues jealously.\"\n\nHe resumes pacing.\n\n\"So the Camera cannot tax the tithes directly. What Rome receives comes through other channels.\"\n\nHe begins counting on his fingers.\n\n\"First: Annates. When a bishop or abbot is appointed to a new benefice, he owes Rome a portion of the first year's income. Historically, this was the full first year—hence the name, from annus. The Basel reform reduces this to one-quarter.\" He glances at the signed documents on the desk. \"This has been our largest reliable revenue. Perhaps forty to fifty thousand florins annually, depending on how many appointments occur.\"\n\n\"Second: Servitia communia and servitia minuta. Fees paid by bishops and abbots upon confirmation of their appointment. These are in addition to annates—a separate extraction. Perhaps fifteen to twenty thousand florins.\"\n\n\"Third: The pallium fees. Every archbishop must receive the pallium from Rome—the woolen band that symbolizes his authority. The fee for this varies by the wealth of the see. A great archbishopric like Mainz or Canterbury might pay thousands of florins. Smaller ones, hundreds. Combined, perhaps ten thousand florins annually.\"\n\n\"Fourth: Dispensations. This is where the corruption festers most visibly.\" His voice hardens. \"A man wishes to marry his cousin. He needs a dispensation. A priest wishes to hold two benefices simultaneously—pluralism. He needs a dispensation. A bishop wishes to ordain a man below the canonical age. Dispensation. Every deviation from canon law requires Roman permission, and Roman permission requires payment.\"\n\nHe stops before Juan.\n\n\"The fee schedules are Byzantine in their complexity. A dispensation for marriage within the fourth degree of consanguinity costs one amount. The third degree, more. The second degree, more still. Legitimization of children born to clergy, more. Permission to eat meat during Lent for health reasons, less—but still something. There is a fee for everything. And the Camera collects.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Impossible to say with precision. The dispensations vary wildly year to year. Perhaps twenty thousand florins. Perhaps forty. It depends on how many bishops die, how many nobles wish to marry cousins, how many priests wish to accumulate benefices.\"\n\nHe continues, his voice taking on a rhythmic quality—a lecturer in his element.\n\n\"Fifth: Judicial fees. Any case may be appealed to Rome. Indeed, many cases must be appealed to Rome—disputes over benefices, accusations against clergy, marriage annulments. Each stage of the process requires payment. Filing fees. Advocate fees. Scribal fees. Sealing fees. A complex case might generate hundreds of florins before judgment is rendered.\"\n\n\"Sixth: Vacant benefices. When a benefice holder dies, the revenues during the vacancy flow to Rome—in theory. In practice, the local bishop often claims them first, and Rome receives only what it can enforce. Perhaps five thousand florins, perhaps less.\"\n\n\"Seventh: Peter's Pence. The ancient tribute from England and certain other kingdoms. Small compared to the others—a few thousand florins—but symbolically important.\"\n\n\"Eighth: Crusade levies. Special taxes imposed for holy war. These require cooperation from secular rulers and church councils. Sporadic. Unpredictable. Sometimes substantial—\" He glances at Juan. \"—as Your Majesty's own contribution demonstrated. Sometimes nothing for years.\"\n\nHe stops, spreading his hands.\n\n\"Sum it all together, Your Majesty. In a typical year—if such a thing exists—the Camera might expect one hundred to one hundred fifty thousand florins. In a good year, with many appointments and few conflicts, perhaps more. In a bad year, with schism and war disrupting collections...\" He shrugs. \"Far less.\"\n\nEugenius speaks quietly. \"And We have not seen a good year since taking the throne.\"\n\n\"No, Holy Father.\" Parentucelli's voice softens slightly. \"The schism with Basel has disrupted collections across Germany and France. Bishops appointed by the Council do not pay annates to Rome. Dispensation seekers go to Basel instead. The French clergy cite Gallican liberties to withhold payments. The revenue that should flow to Rome... diverts.\"\n\nHe turns back to Juan.\n\n\"This is why the Camera has borrowed so heavily. The expected revenue no longer arrives. But the expenses continue. The papal household. The Curia. The guards. The building projects begun by previous popes. The interest on previous debts. The Camera spends one hundred thousand florins regardless of whether it receives one hundred thousand florins.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"And this brings us to your question, Your Majesty. How much does the Camera control? The answer is: far less than it once did, and far less than it needs. The great tree of Church wealth grows vast, but the roots keep most of the water. Rome receives only what trickles up through cracks in the system—annates, fees, dispensations. And even that trickle is drying up.\"\n\nHe looks at the signed reforms on the desk.\n\n\"The decrees we have just signed will reduce that trickle further. Annates cut by three-quarters. Pluralism restricted, which means fewer dispensation fees. These are good reforms—necessary reforms—but they will cost the Camera dearly.\" His eyes meet Juan's. \"If we also cancel existing obligations and debts, we must understand what remains. The answer may be: almost nothing.\""

Military expenses - mercenaries, fortifications\n7. Charitable obligations - hospitals, alms\n8. Debt service - interest on loans\n9. Bribes and \"gifts\" to maintain political alliances\n10. Support for religious orders and missions\n\nParentucelli would know some of this from observation, but the details of actual spending would be hidden. He can give estimates and categories.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? To show the full picture—but also to highlight where the real waste lies. The expenses tell the story of corruption as clearly as the revenues.\n\nWhat won't he say? That some of these expenses benefit people in this room. That the papal household Eugenius maintains is itself part of the problem, however modest compared to his predecessors.\n\nParentucelli nods slowly.\n\n\"The expenses. Yes. This is where the money goes, and it reveals much about why the Camera is always empty.\"\n\nHe moves to the desk, as if wishing he had paper to sketch the figures.\n\n\"The clerical salaries I mentioned—eight to twelve thousand florins—are actually among the more defensible expenses. Scribes must be paid. Notaries must be paid. The work of the Church requires administration.\"\n\nHe turns back, his expression darkening.\n\n\"But beyond salaries, the expenses multiply. Let me walk through them.\"\n\nHe raises a finger.\n\n\"First: The Papal Household. His Holiness must be fed, clothed, housed, and attended. The apostolic palace requires servants—cooks, cleaners, stewards, grooms. The papal chapel requires chaplains, singers, musicians for ceremonies. There are physicians, confessors, secretaries for personal correspondence.\"\n\nHe glances at Eugenius with something like apology.\n\n\"Your Holiness lives more simply than your predecessors. This is known. But even a modest papal household consumes fifteen to twenty thousand florins annually. A immodest household—\" He pauses. \"Martin V spent nearly twice that. And he was considered restrained compared to the Avignon popes.\"\n\n\"Second: The Sacred College.\" His voice takes on an edge. \"Cardinals receive subsidies from the Camera. Not all of them—those with wealthy benefices need nothing. But cardinals in curia—those residing in Rome, attending to Church business—receive allowances for housing, servants, and maintenance appropriate to their dignity.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"It varies by cardinal and by what they can negotiate. Some receive a few hundred florins. Others, thousands. In total?\" He shrugs. \"Perhaps twenty to thirty thousand florins annually flows to the College in direct subsidies. And this does not count the indirect benefits—the benefices reserved for their nominees, the dispensation fees they share, the appointments they influence.\"\n\nEugenius stirs uncomfortably but says nothing.\n\n\"Third: The Curia itself.\" Parentucelli continues. \"The great offices of the Church. The Apostolic Penitentiary, which handles confessional matters. The Rota Romana, the court of appeals. The Chancery, which produces official documents. The Datary, which handles benefice provisions. Each office has staff, space, supplies. Each office generates fees—but each office also consumes funds. Perhaps another fifteen thousand florins in operational costs.\"\n\n\"Fourth: Diplomatic missions.\" He begins pacing again. \"Legates sent to councils, to kings, to bishops. Nuncios maintaining permanent presence at major courts. These men travel with retinues—secretaries, chaplains, servants, guards. They must present themselves with dignity befitting Rome. A major embassy might cost five thousand florins. A permanent nuncio, a thousand annually or more. The Camera funds perhaps ten to twenty thousand florins in diplomatic expenses each year, depending on circumstances.\"\n\n\"Fifth: Military expenses.\" His voice drops. \"The Papal States must be defended. The papal guard must be maintained—two hundred men, Your Holiness said. Their salaries, equipment, housing. Perhaps eight to ten thousand florins. But beyond the guard, there are fortresses to garrison throughout the Patrimony. Mercenaries to hire when threats arise. Walls to repair. In times of war—\" He glances at Eugenius. \"The costs multiply without limit.\"\n\nEugenius speaks quietly. \"The Visconti threat has cost Us dearly these past years.\"\n\n\"Yes, Holy Father. Military expenses in a troubled year might reach thirty or forty thousand florins. Perhaps more.\"\n\nParentucelli pauses, gathering himself for what comes next.\n\n\"Sixth: Building and maintenance.\" His tone becomes carefully neutral. \"The basilicas must be maintained. Saint Peter's alone requires constant attention—the roof, the mosaics, the fabric of the building. The Lateran. Santa Maria Maggiore. The apostolic palace itself. Previous popes began projects that subsequent popes must complete or abandon—and abandonment brings its own costs, as unfinished work decays.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Depends entirely on ambition, Your Majesty. A pope who merely maintains might spend ten thousand florins annually. A pope who builds...\" He shakes his head. \"Martin V spent fortunes restoring Rome after the schism. Tens of thousands of florins. Some would say hundreds of thousands over his pontificate.\"\n\n\"Seventh: Charitable obligations.\" A slight softening in his voice. \"The Church should feed the poor, shelter pilgrims, maintain hospitals. The Camera funds several hospices in Rome. Alms are distributed on certain feast days. This is perhaps the most defensible expense—and also the smallest. A few thousand florins. Perhaps five. The charity of the institutional Church is...\" He pauses. \"...modest, compared to its other expenditures.\"\n\n\"Eighth: Debt service.\" His voice hardens again. \"The interest on accumulated borrowing. If the Camera owes sixty thousand florins at typical rates—disguised as fees, but call it ten percent—that is six thousand florins annually merely to stand still. To actually reduce the debt requires more. The wheel turns, as I said. This expense grows each year it is not addressed.\"\n\nHe stops, turning to face them both.\n\n\"Sum it all, Your Majesty. In a typical year, the Camera must spend—at minimum—one hundred thousand florins. Salaries: ten thousand. Papal household: twenty thousand. Cardinals' subsidies: twenty-five thousand. Curial operations: fifteen thousand. Diplomacy: fifteen thousand. Military: ten thousand in peacetime, far more in war. Building: ten thousand for maintenance alone. Charity: five thousand. Debt service: six thousand.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"That is one hundred sixteen thousand florins, and I have been conservative in every estimate. I have not included extraordinary expenses—a council, a jubilee, a war, a major building project. I have not included the informal expenses that never appear in ledgers—the gifts to secure loyalty, the bribes to prevent opposition, the quiet payments that keep the machinery turning.\"\n\nHis eyes meet Juan's.\n\n\"The Camera receives perhaps one hundred thousand florins in a good year. It spends one hundred sixteen thousand in a quiet year. The deficit is covered by borrowing—which increases debt service—which increases the deficit. This is why the Camera is always empty. This is why your crusade treasury vanished. Not because any single man stole it, but because the institution consumes faster than it receives.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"And the reforms we have just signed will reduce revenue further, while leaving expenses unchanged. Unless—\" He looks at the unsigned space on the desk where the Camera reform decree will go. \"Unless we also reform the expenses.\""

Potentially get excited about this approach\n\nBut he should also note complications:\n- The cardinals won't voluntarily accept their expenses being shifted to them\n- The Basel decree was about revenue, not expense allocation\n- There's no precedent for making the College collectively responsible for individual cardinal subsidies\n- The cardinals will resist fiercely\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? To solve this puzzle. This is exactly the kind of administrative challenge he's been preparing for. He wants to show his worth.\n\nWhat won't he say? That this is brilliant.

If we divide the income, should we not also divide the expenses?\"\n\nHe looks up, something kindling in his expression.\n\n\"The Basel fathers did not address this. They thought only of reducing Rome's extraction from the provinces. They did not consider—or did not care—how Rome would then fund itself.\" A thin smile. \"Perhaps they hoped we would simply wither.\"\n\nHe sets down the document and begins to pace, his movements quicker now.\n\n\"But let us think through the logic. The Camera, as currently constituted, funds everything. Papal household. Cardinals' subsidies. Curial offices. Diplomacy. Military. Building. Charity. All from one purse, with no clear accounting of which revenues support which functions.\"\n\nHe stops, turning to face them.\n\n\"If we accept the Basel framework—truly accept it, not merely sign it—then we must ask: what is the Camera for? What is its essential function?\"\n\nHe answers his own question.\n\n\"The Camera exists to fund the papacy. The Holy Father. The administration that serves him directly. The household. The guards. The diplomatic missions he sends. The buildings he maintains. The charity he dispenses in Christ's name.\" He gestures at Eugenius. \"These are papal expenses. They should come from papal revenue—the Camera's half of the annates, plus whatever other fees remain.\"\n\nHis voice sharpens.\n\n\"But the cardinals? The Sacred College?\" He shakes his head. \"They are not the Pope's servants. They are—in theory—his advisors, his electors, his partners in governance. Why should the Pope fund their palazzos? Why should papal revenue pay for their households, their retinues, their libraries and banquets?\"\n\nHe looks at Juan.\n\n\"If the College of Cardinals receives half the annates under Basel's decree, then let the College fund itself from that half. Let them determine among themselves how to divide it. Let them decide which of their number deserves a subsidy and which can live from his benefices alone.\"\n\nEugenius stirs. \"They will not accept this willingly.\"\n\n\"No, Holy Father.\" Parentucelli's smile turns cold. \"They will not. But consider the alternative they face. If they refuse—if they demand the Camera continue funding their subsidies—then they are admitting they cannot govern themselves. They are admitting they need papal charity. And they must make this admission publicly, after Basel has just given them an independent revenue stream.\"\n\nHe turns back to Juan.\n\n\"The beauty of this approach, Your Majesty, is that it uses Basel's own decree against the cardinals who supported it. They wanted independence from papal control? Very well—they shall have it. Independence means funding themselves.\"\n\nHe moves to the desk, his mind clearly racing.\n\n\"Let me think through the division. Expenses that remain with the Camera—the papal expenses:\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers.\n\n\"Clerical salaries for Camera staff—yes, perhaps eight thousand florins. Papal household—twenty thousand. Papal guard—eight thousand. Diplomatic missions sent in the Pope's name—fifteen thousand. Building maintenance for papal properties—ten thousand. Charitable works—five thousand. Debt service on existing obligations—six thousand, until debts are cleared.\"\n\nHe pauses, calculating.\n\n\"Perhaps seventy thousand florins in core papal expenses. Possibly less if we trim carefully.\"\n\n\"And shifted to the College?\"\n\n\"Cardinals' subsidies—twenty-five thousand florins, gone from the Camera entirely. Let them fund themselves.\" His voice carries satisfaction. \"And certain curial offices might also shift. The Rota Romana hears appeals that benefit the whole Church, not just the Pope. The Penitentiary serves all Catholics. Perhaps some portion of curial expenses—say five to ten thousand florins—should come from the College's share.\"\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\"If we execute this cleanly, the Camera's expenses fall from over one hundred thousand florins to perhaps seventy thousand. Meanwhile, the College inherits responsibility for thirty to forty thousand in expenses—from a revenue stream that might generate only twenty to thirty thousand florins, depending on appointments.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"They will have to economize, Holy Father. They will have to choose between subsidizing Cardinal Colonna's palazzo and funding the Rota's operations. They will have to govern rather than merely extract.\"\n\nHe looks between them.\n\n\"Is this what Your Majesty envisions? The Camera stripped to essential papal functions, the College made responsible for itself?\""

He should be able to speak to their intent and whether this division of expenses follows naturally from the division of revenues.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? To demonstrate his knowledge of Basel's intentions, and to show how this approach is actually consistent with conciliar reform principles - even if the Council fathers didn't think through all the implications.\n\nWhat won't he say? That Basel would probably be horrified to see their revenue reforms used to strip cardinals of papal subsidies. That the Council fathers wanted to weaken Rome, not force the College to govern itself responsibly.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? To show how deeply he understands Basel's logic—and how that logic can be turned to serve papal interests rather than undermine them.\n\nWhat won't he say?

To break Rome's monopoly on revenue and power. To give metropolitans and provinces greater authority over their own affairs.\" He turns back. \"The annates decree does precisely this—half the revenue stays closer to where it originates, under the metropolitan's control rather than the Camera's.\"\n\nHe raises a finger.\n\n\"But the Council fathers made an assumption. They assumed that reducing papal revenue would weaken papal power. They assumed the Pope would be forced to come begging to the Council for funds, making him dependent on conciliar goodwill.\"\n\nHis smile sharpens.\n\n\"What they did not consider is that a Pope might accept reduced revenue and reduce expenses accordingly.

The Camera's extractions are reduced—Basel's explicit goal. But the curial bloat is also reduced—the cardinals must fund themselves from their own share rather than feeding at the papal trough. The Pope becomes leaner, more focused, more... apostolic. Less a Renaissance prince and more a shepherd.\"\n\nHis eyes meet Juan's.\n\n\"If Basel's spirit is genuine reform of Church governance, then yes—this fulfills that spirit more completely than Basel itself imagined. We are not merely reducing revenue. We are restructuring responsibility.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But I must be honest, Your Majesty. The men at Basel—Cardinal d'Allemand, the French faction—they do not want a reformed papacy. They want a subordinate papacy. A Pope who must ask the Council's permission before acting. They will not celebrate this interpretation. They will call it trickery, evasion, a perversion of their intent.\"\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n\"Let them. The decree says what it says. Half to the Camera, half to the metropolitans and cardinals. It does not say the Camera must continue funding cardinals' subsidies from its diminished share. It does not say the Pope must beggar himself while cardinals live in splendor.\"\n\nHe glances at Eugenius.\n\n\"When this is announced—when the full implications become clear—Basel will face a choice. Do they denounce reforms they themselves decreed? Do they demand the Pope increase spending on cardinals? Do they argue that Church revenues should fund palazzos rather than charity?\"\n\nA cold satisfaction enters his voice.\n\n\"Every argument they make will expose them. They claimed to want reform. We are giving them reform—more reform than they ever intended. If they object, they reveal that their true goal was never reform at all. It was merely power.\"\n\nHe turns back to Juan.\n\n\"So yes, Your Majesty. This is the spirit of Basel. Distilled. Purified.

He might soften his position slightly here to show he's not blindly anti-cardinal.\n\nLet me think about the actual situation:\n- Cardinals have multiple income sources: their benefices, their share of annates under the new system, various fees and percentages\n- Many cardinals hold very wealthy benefices - bishoprics like Milan, Toledo, etc. generate tens of thousands of florins\n- The subsidies from the Camera are often supplemental, not primary income\n- Some cardinals genuinely are poor - those from minor sees, those who rose through scholarship rather than family connections (like Albergati, Parentucelli's patron)\n- The question is whether the FUNCTION can be performed, not whether luxury can be maintained\n\nParentucelli should give a nuanced answer - distinguish between cardinals who genuinely need support and those who are simply accustomed to excess.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? To show he's not merely vindictive—that this is practical reform, not blind destruction. He needs to demonstrate nuance, or Juan might think him a zealot who would burn down the institution to purify it.\n\nWhat won't he say?

If the Camera ceased his subsidy tomorrow, he would not miss a single meal. His palazzo would remain full of servants. His stables would remain full of horses.\"\n\nHe raises a hand.\n\n\"But then consider Cardinal Albergati.\" His voice softens almost imperceptibly. \"A Carthusian monk who rose through sanctity and scholarship. He has no family wealth. His benefices are modest. He lives simply because he believes in simplicity—but also because he has no choice. Without some support, he could not maintain even a minimal household. He could not travel to councils. He could not perform the functions expected of a cardinal.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan directly.\n\n\"If we strip away all subsidies indiscriminately, we punish the Albergatis to spite the Colonnas. We make the Sacred College a preserve of the wealthy—only men with family fortunes or rich benefices could afford to serve. The poor scholar, the holy monk, the bishop from a minor see—these men would be excluded.\"\n\nHe pauses, gathering his thoughts.\n\n\"The same applies to bishops. The Archbishop of Toledo—\" He glances at Juan. \"—commands revenues that would make some princes envious. Reducing his annates by three-quarters still leaves him wealthy beyond measure. But the Bishop of some mountain diocese in Savoy? A see with thirty parishes and peasants who pay tithes in goats and cheese? That man struggles to maintain a cathedral chapter. Further reduction might genuinely impair his function.\"\n\nEugenius speaks quietly. \"So the reform must distinguish. Between those who have much and those who have little.\"\n\n\"Yes, Holy Father.\" Parentucelli nods. \"The principle of reform is sound—the Camera should not fund luxury for those who need no help. But the application must be... discerning.\"\n\nHe begins pacing again, working through the problem aloud.\n\n\"Perhaps the solution is this: the College of Cardinals receives its half of the annates as a common fund. From this fund, the College must pay for shared expenses—the Rota, the Penitentiary, whatever curial functions we assign to them. What remains after these obligations is divided among the cardinals themselves.\"\n\nHe stops.\n\n\"But divided how? Not equally—that would give Cardinal Colonna the same subsidy as Cardinal Albergati, which serves no purpose. Instead, divided according to need. Cardinals with wealthy benefices or family fortunes receive nothing. Cardinals with modest means receive support sufficient to perform their functions with dignity—not luxury, but dignity.\"\n\nHis voice sharpens slightly.\n\n\"This forces the College to govern itself. To make decisions. To look their brother cardinals in the eye and say: 'You have enough. You need nothing from the common purse.' Or: 'You have little. We shall support you.' It makes them accountable to each other rather than simply drawing from an endless papal fountain.\"\n\nHe turns to Juan.\n\n\"The same principle could apply to bishops, through their metropolitans. The metropolitan receives the provincial share of annates. He distributes support to suffragan bishops according to need—wealthy sees receive nothing, poor sees receive help. The metropolitan becomes responsible for his province's welfare, not merely its extraction.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Will some bishops and cardinals see their income reduced? Yes. Substantially. But these will be the men who least need it—those with multiple benefices, family wealth, comfortable arrangements. Will the truly poor be protected? They can be, if the system is designed properly.\"\n\nHe looks between Eugenius and Juan.\n\n\"The question is whether the College and the metropolitans can be trusted to distribute fairly. History suggests... caution. The wealthy look after the wealthy. The powerful protect the powerful.\"\n\nA slight smile.\n\n\"But that is where enforcement matters. If the Camera reform decree includes provisions requiring transparent accounting from the College—if Albergati can see exactly how much Colonna receives and demand justification—then the pressure for fairness increases. Sunlight, as we discussed. Let them make their decisions, but make them publicly.\"\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\"Does this address Your Majesty's concern? The reform need not impoverish those who are already poor. It need only cease enriching those who are already rich.\""

Parentucelli passionately wants justice but accepts Juan's argument: prosecuting past offenders would unite all cardinals against the reform. The decision is amnesty for past practices — framed as 'the past is rendered to God's mercy, the future is committed to our common labor.' Those who embrace reform in good faith are forgiven; those who secretly continue face prosecution under new law. Parentucelli struggles emotionally, calling it wisdom he did not possess an hour ago. Juan promises that justice is not cancelled but merely coming — 'Rome was not built in one day.' Parentucelli then catalogs additional forms of corruption to address: simony in appointments, expectancy trading, coadjutors with right of succession (making bishoprics effectively heritable), pensions charged on benefices (disguising pluralism), and compositions (buying absolution for ongoing violations). The decree will end compositions, restrict expectancies, and require metropolitan approval for coadjutors. Eugenius delivers an emotional reflection on his pontificate — from plans and visions to fleeing Rome in a fisherman's boat, and now finally remembering why he wanted the throne.",

          "text": "Parentucelli has already revealed he wants justice. He spoke earlier about wanting to see guilty men punished. But Juan has consistently advocated for the \"clean slate\" approach - stop the bleeding first, worry about justice later.\n\nNow Juan is asking for input on whether to include investigations. This is a genuine question about strategy.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? He wants justice. He's been watching corruption for twenty years. But he's also a pragmatist who has survived in curial politics. He understands the argument for mercy.\n\nWhat does Eugenius want? He's already committed to \"bringing down the hammer\" but he's also exhausted and perhaps having second thoughts about how far to push.\n\nI should have both NPCs respond to this, perhaps with different perspectives. Parentucelli might argue for at least some accountability, while Eugenius might be relieved at the prospect of avoiding a purge.\n\nLet me write this scene with appropriate NPC resistance and their own agendas.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? Justice. He's said as much. But he's also a pragmatist who has survived twenty years in curial politics. He's wrestling with himself—the fury that wants reckoning versus the wisdom that knows reform matters more than punishment.\n\nWhat won't he say? That this mercy feels like defeat. That he's catalogued sins in his mind for years, waiting for a day of accounting that may now never come.\n\nWhat does Eugenius want? To succeed. He's committed to reform, but a purge terrifies him. Every cardinal put against the wall has friends, family, allies. A pope who destroys too many princes of the Church may not survive the backlash.\n\nWhat won't he say? That he's relieved Juan is suggesting restraint. That he feared the Castilian king might demand blood.\n\nParentucelli is silent for a long moment. His jaw works. Something wars behind his eyes.\n\n\"Your Majesty is...\" He stops. Starts again. \"Your Majesty is wise to consider this carefully.\"\n\nThe words come out slowly, as if each one costs him something.\n\n\"I spoke earlier of justice. Of finding the men who pledged Church property to bankers. Of holding them accountable.\" He moves toward the window, his back partially turned. \"Part of me still wants this. Twenty years of watching, Your Majesty. Twenty years of seeing good priests ground down while corrupt men prospered. The ledger in my heart cries out for balance.\"\n\nHe turns back. His face is composed, but something burns beneath.\n\n\"But you are right. If we announce investigations alongside the reform—if cardinals wake tomorrow fearing not just reduced income but imprisonment, disgrace, ruin—they will unite against us. Every man with a secret becomes an enemy. Every family with something to hide becomes a faction seeking our destruction.\"\n\nEugenius stirs in his chair.\n\n\"We have thought on this as well.\" The Pope's voice is heavy. \"When We spoke of bringing down the hammer, We meant reform. Structural change. Not...\" He waves a hand vaguely. \"Not trials. Not executions. Not dragging princes of the Church before tribunals.\"\n\nHe rises, moving slowly toward the window where Parentucelli stands.\n\n\"The Church has seen such purges before. They do not end well. Accusations breed counter-accusations. Factions form. Men who might have accepted reform peacefully instead fight to the death because they have nothing left to lose.\"\n\nParentucelli nods reluctantly.\n\n\"The mathematics of fear, Holy Father. A man who loses income grumbles but adapts. A man who faces investigation panics. A man who faces ruin has no reason for restraint.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan.\n\n\"If we focus the decree purely on structural reform—the clean ledger, the separation of Camera and College, the reduction of expenses—we give the corrupt a path forward. They lose privilege, yes. They lose the system that enriched them. But they keep their positions. Their dignity. Their freedom.\"\n\nHis voice tightens.\n\n\"Some will even prosper under the new system, if they adapt. A cardinal who learned to extract under the old ways might learn to economize under the new. We offer them... conversion. A chance to become what they should have been.\"\n\nEugenius turns from the window.\n\n\"And if they refuse? If corruption continues despite reform?\"\n\nParentucelli's expression hardens.\n\n\"Then we address it then, Holy Father. Specifically. Individually. When the new system is established, when the Camera is reformed, when we have evidence gathered under proper authority—then a single corrupt cardinal can be pursued without threatening the whole College. The system will be strong enough to survive removing one bad actor.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But now? Tonight? If we try to reform the institution and punish its abusers simultaneously, we attempt too much. We create too many enemies at once. We give them common cause.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan, and something like pain crosses his face.\n\n\"It galls me to say this, Your Majesty. After everything I have seen. After everything I have burned to see corrected. But you are right. We should focus the decree on reform. On the future. On building something clean.\"\n\nA long pause.\n\n\"Let the guilty keep their ill-gotten gains. Let them sleep peacefully in beds bought with stolen coin. The price of their comfort is a reformed Church that will never again permit such theft. Perhaps that is justice enough.\"\n\nHe does not sound convinced. But he sounds resigned.\n\nEugenius speaks quietly.\n\n\"We could include language. Something that preserves the possibility without creating immediate threat. 'The Holy See reserves the right to examine past practices as circumstances warrant.' It promises nothing. It threatens nothing specific. But it reminds them that mercy today does not guarantee mercy forever.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan.\n\n\"Would such language serve? A door left open, but not walked through?\""

He might struggle with this emotionally but intellectually accept it.\n\nEugenius: This should be a relief. He's been worried about the backlash. An amnesty approach gives him cover and reduces the danger to his person.\n\nI should show both men processing this - Parentucelli's internal struggle, Eugenius's relief, and then have them engage with the practical question of how to frame this in the decree.\n\nThe key dramatic tension: Parentucelli has to let go of his dream of justice. This is character development for him. He's being asked to choose reform over revenge, and it costs him something.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? To accept this wisdom even though it burns. He knows Juan is right. He hates that Juan is right.\n\nWhat won't he say? That he's grieving something. A fantasy he's nursed for years—the day when the corrupt would face judgment. That fantasy is dying in this room.\n\nWhat does Eugenius want? To embrace this approach. It protects him, protects the reform, and offers him something he desperately needs—the possibility of reconciliation with men he must work with for the rest of his pontificate.\n\nWhat won't he say? How relieved he is. How much he feared Juan would demand blood.\n\nSilence holds the room for a long moment.\n\nParentucelli stands motionless by the window. His hands have clenched at his sides.

Not enemies.\"\n\nHe repeats the words as if testing their weight.\n\n\"Yes.\" The word comes out rough. \"Yes, Your Majesty is... correct. If a cardinal looks at this reform and sees only threat—only loss, only danger—he will fight it. But if he looks and sees... a path forward. A way to become something better without first being destroyed for what he was...\"\n\nHe turns from the window.

But if we declare that the whispers were wrong—that the game itself was wrong—and offer a new game with new rules...\"\n\nHe looks at Juan.\n\n\"Then the man who compromised his conscience has a choice. He can cling to the old ways and be exposed as corrupt. Or he can embrace the new ways and be reformed. Redeemed, even. His past sins... not forgotten, but... covered over by present virtue.\"\n\nEugenius has been listening intently. Now he speaks, and there is something like hope in his voice.\n\n\"This is the Gospel, is it not? Repentance and new life. The prodigal son returns and is welcomed, not punished for his years of dissolution.\"\n\nHe rises, moving toward Juan.\n\n\"We have spent three years as Pope treating Our cardinals as enemies to be managed. Factions to be balanced. Threats to be contained.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"Perhaps We created enemies by expecting enemies. Perhaps if We had offered trust...\"\n\nHe stops himself.\n\n\"No. The corruption was real. The threat was real. But now—with reform, with structure, with clear expectations—perhaps We can offer what We could not before. A new beginning. For them as well as for the Camera.\"\n\nHe turns to Parentucelli.\n\n\"Tommaso. You have the gift of language. How would you frame this? An amnesty that does not excuse—that acknowledges wrong was done—but offers forgiveness to those who embrace the new way?\"\n\nParentucelli is quiet for a moment. When he speaks, his voice has steadied. The scholar taking over from the wounded idealist.\n\n\"We might say something like this, Holy Father:\"\n\nHe closes his eyes, composing.\n\n\"'We acknowledge that practices have taken root which, though long tolerated by custom, do not accord with the ancient discipline of the Church nor the Gospel of Christ. We do not seek to punish those who followed paths that circumstance and precedent seemed to permit. Rather, We call all servants of the Church to walk henceforth in newness of life, setting aside former ways as a man sets aside the garments of his youth.'\"\n\nHe opens his eyes.\n\n\"'Let no man fear prosecution for what was done under the old dispensation, provided he embraces in good faith the reforms herein decreed. The past is rendered to God's mercy. The future is committed to our common labor.'\"\n\nHe looks at Juan.\n\n\"Something of this nature. It acknowledges wrongdoing without naming criminals. It offers amnesty without excusing sin. It frames reform as invitation rather than prosecution.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"And it leaves one door open. 'Provided he embraces in good faith.' Those who publicly accept reform but secretly continue the old corruption—they have rejected the amnesty by their own actions. They can be pursued later, individually, as violators of new law rather than practitioners of old custom.\"\n\nEugenius nods slowly.\n\n\"The hand extended in peace. But the sword kept ready for those who spit upon the hand.\"\n\n\"Just so, Holy Father.\"\n\nParentucelli turns to Juan. Something has shifted in his bearing. The burning fury has not vanished—it has been... banked. Controlled. Channeled.\n\n\"Your Majesty spoke of stopping the bleeding first. Of making well-meaning men into allies.\" He inclines his head slightly. \"This is wisdom I did not possess an hour ago. I was thinking of justice.

It's a good moment of levity after a heavy emotional exchange.\n\nNow Juan wants to get back to the practical details of the Camera reform decree. What else needs to be addressed?\n\nLet me think about what we've covered so far:\n\n1. Clean slate approach - not investigating past corruption\n2. Separation of Camera expenses from College of Cardinals expenses\n3. Camera reduced to essential papal functions (household, guards, diplomacy, building maintenance, charity, debt service)\n4. Cardinals fund themselves from their half of annates\n5. Need-based distribution among cardinals (wealthy get nothing, poor get support)\n6. Amnesty for past practices, prosecution only for those who continue under new rules\n7. Transparency and accountability\n\nWhat else would need to be in a comprehensive Camera reform decree?\n\nThings not yet addressed:\n- Specific procedures for the Camera going forward\n- Who controls what - chain of command\n- Audit mechanisms / oversight\n- How existing debts will be handled\n- What happens to current Camera officials\n- Timeline for implementation\n- How revenue is collected and by whom\n- Banking relationships - the Medici entanglement\n- Document retention and transparency\n- Reporting requirements\n- What happens to existing \"arrangements\" and \"understandings\"\n- Protection for whistleblowers or honest clerks\n- Penalties for future violations\n\nParentucelli should walk through these systematically, as the expert on Camera operations.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? To be useful. The emotional moment has passed; now he wants to prove his worth through expertise. This is comfortable ground—practical problems with practical solutions.\n\nWhat won't he say? That the joke actually helped. That the brief moment of levity released something tight in his chest.\n\nA surprised sound escapes Parentucelli—something that might, in other circumstances, be called a laugh. Eugenius's lips twitch.\n\n\"Rome indeed, Your Majesty,\" Parentucelli says, and there is warmth beneath the wry tone.\n\nHe moves back to the desk, his manner shifting. The wounded idealist has retreated; the administrator has emerged. He begins arranging the documents already signed, creating space for notes.\n\n\"What else. Yes. Let me think through the structure systematically.\"\n\nHe picks up a quill, not to write but to gesture with—a lecturer's habit.\n\n\"We have established the principle: separation of Camera and College, reduction of expenses, amnesty for past practices. But principles require mechanisms. The decree must answer practical questions, or it becomes merely aspirational.\"\n\nHe begins counting on his fingers.\n\n\"First: The existing officials. The Camera currently employs dozens of men—clerks, notaries, collectors, auditors. What happens to them? Do we dismiss them all and start fresh? Do we retain some and dismiss others? On what basis?\"\n\nHe looks at Eugenius.\n\n\"If we dismiss everyone, we lose institutional knowledge. No one will know where the documents are, how the systems work, which revenues come from where. Chaos. But if we retain everyone, we keep the very men who built and benefited from the corrupt system. They will sabotage reform from within.\"\n\nHe taps the quill against his palm.\n\n\"I would suggest a middle path. All current officials are suspended pending review—my review, under the commission His Holiness has signed. They continue to receive salary during suspension, so they have no immediate grievance. But they do not touch documents, do not process payments, do not conduct any Camera business. I examine each one individually. Those who demonstrate competence and willingness to work under new rules are reinstated. Those who do not...\"\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n\"They receive a letter of thanks for their service and are sent home. No prosecution. No disgrace. Simply... retirement.\"\n\nHe raises a second finger.\n\n\"Second: The banking relationships. The Medici. The other lenders. We cannot simply pretend these entanglements do not exist. The Camera owes money. The Camera's revenue flows through Medici accounts. Severing this connection entirely would be... complicated.\"\n\nHis expression darkens.\n\n\"But nor can we allow bankers to continue extracting percentages and holding leverage over Church finances. The decree should establish that all Camera revenues flow through accounts controlled solely by papal officials. No banker retains funds on the Camera's behalf. No banker deducts fees without explicit written authorization for each transaction.\"\n\nHe glances at Juan.\n\n\"The Medici will not like this. They profit enormously from being papal bankers—not merely from interest, but from the prestige, the information, the ability to say 'we handle the Pope's money.' Reducing them to mere... service providers... wounds their pride and their purse.\"\n\n\"Can they retaliate?\"\n\n\"They can call in debts. They can refuse future loans. They can make difficulties with transfers of funds across borders.\" Parentucelli pauses. \"But Your Majesty spoke of Castile offering donations to cover debts the Camera cannot pay. If that offer stands, the Medici's leverage diminishes considerably. A debtor who can repay is not a debtor who can be controlled.\"\n\nHe raises a third finger.\n\n\"Third: Transparency and audit. The current Camera operates in darkness. No one outside—and few inside—can trace how money flows. The decree should mandate regular accountings. Quarterly, perhaps. Published ledgers showing all revenues received and all expenses paid. Not the details of every transaction—that would be unworkable—but summaries sufficient that any literate man can see: this much came in, this much went out, this much remains.\"\n\nHis voice sharpens.\n\n\"Sunlight. As we discussed. Let the cardinals see exactly what the Camera spends on the papal household. Let the papal household see exactly what the College receives. Let both see what goes to debt service, to diplomacy, to charity. When everyone can see the numbers, lies become difficult.\"\n\nA fourth finger.\n\n\"Fourth: The collection system. Currently, annates and fees are collected by a web of agents, sub-collectors, and local representatives—each taking a percentage, each adding delays, each creating opportunities for... leakage. The decree should simplify this. Fewer intermediaries. Clear lines of responsibility. Perhaps regional collectors who answer directly to the Camera, rather than networks of sub-agents answering to each other.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"This will take time to implement. We cannot rebuild the entire collection system overnight. But the decree can establish the principle and mandate a timeline—say, one year to rationalize collection in Italy, two years for the rest of Christendom.\"\n\nA fifth finger.\n\n\"Fifth: Document retention. This is crucial, Your Majesty. The Camera's records are... scattered. Some in the apostolic palace. Some in the Camera offices. Some in the personal possession of officials who have taken documents home and never returned them. The decree should mandate that all Camera documents—past and present—are property of the Holy See and must be surrendered to central archives. Anyone holding documents must return them within thirty days or face... consequences.\"\n\nHe glances at Eugenius.\n\n\"This will be resisted fiercely. Those documents contain evidence.

Let me think about what else might exist in 15th century Church finances and Camera operations that could be corrupt.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? To be thorough. To demonstrate his complete knowledge. He's been asked directly if there's more, and he wants to show he knows where all the bodies are buried.\n\nWhat won't he say? That some of these practices are so embedded they might be impossible to root out entirely. That he's not entirely sure even he knows the full extent of it.\n\nForms of corruption in the medieval Church that haven't been fully addressed yet:\n\n1. Sale of offices (simony) - purchasing positions\n2. Nepotism - appointing family members\n3. Benefice trading/trafficking - informal markets in church positions\n4. False documentation - forged bulls, dispensations\n5. \"Compositions\" - negotiated settlements that reduce penalties for fees\n6. Expectancies - promises of future benefices (selling positions before they're vacant)\n7. Coadjutors with right of succession - essentially inheriting church positions\n8. Pensions charged on benefices - forcing benefice holders to pay portions to third parties\n9. Appropriation of vacant benefice revenues\n10. Fees for expediting documents - bribes to move paperwork faster\n\nLet me have Parentucelli address some of these that haven't been covered yet.\n\nWhat does Parentucelli want? To be thorough. To demonstrate that twenty years of watching have made him an expert in every dark corner of curial corruption. If Juan asks whether anything remains, Parentucelli wants to prove he knows where all the bodies are buried.\n\nWhat won't he say? That some of these practices are so deeply embedded they may be impossible to fully eradicate. That even he may not know the full extent of it.\n\nParentucelli's brow furrows. He moves back toward the window, thinking.\n\n\"Other forms. Yes. There are... layers to this, Your Majesty. What I have described addresses the Camera's operations—how money flows in and out. But there are practices that exist alongside the Camera. Adjacent to it. Feeding on the same system.\"\n\nHe turns back, his expression darkening.\n\n\"Let me describe what else festers.\"\n\nHe raises a finger.\n\n\"Simony. The sale of sacred offices. This is ancient sin—Simon Magus tried to buy the gifts of the Holy Spirit from the Apostles themselves. The Church has condemned it for fourteen centuries. And yet...\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"A bishop dies. Three candidates seek his see. One is learned and holy but poor. One is mediocre but has a wealthy patron. One is utterly unqualified but offers ten thousand florins to the right cardinal. Which one receives the appointment?\"\n\nHis voice carries bitter familiarity.\n\n\"The transaction is never so crude as a direct payment. Instead, the candidate makes a gift to a cardinal's charitable endeavor. Or promises to appoint the cardinal's nephew to a canonry. Or agrees to support the cardinal's position on some unrelated matter. The see is granted. Everyone pretends the gift had nothing to do with it.\"\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"The reforms on pluralism and annates do not touch this. A man may hold only one benefice under the new rules—but he still purchased that benefice. We have addressed how much the Church extracts from appointments. We have not addressed how appointments are made.\"\n\nA second finger.\n\n\"Expectancies. Promises of future benefices. A cardinal tells a young clerk: 'When Bishop so-and-so dies, I will see you appointed to his canonry.' The clerk pays—in money, in service, in loyalty—for this promise. Sometimes multiple clerks pay for the same expectancy. When the bishop finally dies, several men hold conflicting promises to the same position.\"\n\nHis lip curls.\n\n\"This creates a market in futures. Men trade expectancies like merchants trade grain contracts. 'I hold an expectancy to a canonry in Cologne, you hold one in Milan—let us exchange, for Milan suits me better.' The benefice becomes property to be bought and sold before its current holder is even cold.\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"Coadjutors with right of succession. A bishop grows old. Rather than wait for death to create a vacancy, he appoints a coadjutor—an assistant with the right to succeed him. In theory, this ensures continuity of governance. In practice...\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"The coadjutor pays for the privilege. The old bishop receives a pension from his own see's revenues. When he dies, the coadjutor inherits smoothly—because he has already purchased the position. The bishopric has become, in effect, heritable property. Father to son would be too obvious—but uncle to nephew, patron to client, the effect is the same.\"\n\nA fourth finger.\n\n\"Pensions charged on benefices. A cardinal resigns a benefice—or appears to resign it. He transfers it to another man. But the transfer comes with a condition: the new holder must pay half the revenues to the old holder as a pension. Forever. Or until the old holder dies. Or until some further payment releases the obligation.\"\n\nHis voice sharpens.\n\n\"This allows a man to hold a benefice in all but name while appearing to comply with rules against pluralism. 'I have resigned the bishopric of X,' he says. 'I hold only Y.' But the bishop of X sends him three thousand florins annually, and everyone knows the truth.\"\n\nA fifth finger.\n\n\"Compositions. When a man is caught in violation—holding incompatible benefices, living in concubinage, neglecting his duties—the Camera offers a choice. Face canonical penalties: censure, removal, disgrace. Or... pay a fine. A composition. The sin is absolved, the fee is collected, the violator continues as before.\"\n\nHe laughs, but there is no humor in it.\n\n\"We have made confession itself a revenue stream. The worse the sin, the higher the fee. A priest with a concubine pays his composition and keeps his concubine. A bishop holding four benefices pays and keeps all four. The Camera profits from the very corruption it should punish.\"\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\"These practices—simony, expectancies, coadjutors, pensions, compositions—they exist around the Camera, not within it. But the Camera enables them. The Camera processes the paperwork that makes them possible. The Camera collects the fees that make them profitable.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan.\n\n\"The decree we draft tonight can address some of this. We can prohibit compositions for serious violations—no more buying absolution for ongoing sin. We can mandate that expectancies be registered and limited—no man may hold more than one, no expectancy may be sold or traded. We can require that coadjutors be approved by the metropolitan, not merely purchased from Rome. We can void pensions that obviously circumvent benefice rules.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But simony itself? The quiet exchange of favors for appointments?\" He shakes his head slowly. \"That requires changing hearts, not systems. As long as men value wealth over holiness, they will find ways to buy what should be given by grace. We can make it harder. We can make it riskier. We cannot make it impossible.\"\n\nHe looks at Eugenius.\n\n\"This is where the amnesty becomes... complicated, Holy Father. Every cardinal in Rome has participated in these practices to some degree. Every bishop owes his position, at least in part, to connections and contributions rather than pure merit. If we declare all such arrangements void—\"\n\nHe stops.\n\n\"We would have to void half the episcopate. Chaos. Schism. The cure worse than the disease.\"\n\nHe turns back to Juan.\n\n\"So we draw a line. Past arrangements stand—the amnesty covers them. But new simony, new expectancy trading, new pension schemes—these violate the reform and will be punished. We cannot purify the past. We can only close the door against the future.\"\n\nA long pause.\n\n\"Have I captured most of it? I think so, Your Majesty. There are smaller corruptions—fees for expediting documents, bribes to scribes for favorable copying, gifts to doorkeepers for access—but these are symptoms, not diseases. Reform the major systems and the minor corruptions wither for lack of nourishment.\"\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\"Unless Your Majesty sees something I have missed?\""

The reunion with the Greeks. The defense of Christendom against the Turk.\"\n\nHe moves slowly back toward them, his steps heavy.\n\n\"Three years. Three years of councils that defied Us. Cardinals who schemed against Us. Armies at Our gates. We fled Rome in a fisherman's boat, Your Majesty. Disguised. Hunted. The Vicar of Christ, rowing across the Tiber in the dark like a common fugitive.\"\n\nHe stops before the desk where the signed documents lie—the commission, the declaration, the Basel reforms with papal seal.\n\n\"We learned to think small. To survive today. To postpone tomorrow. To call it wisdom when it was merely... fear.\"\n\nHis hand reaches out, fingers brushing the parchment.\n\n\"And now this.\" His voice drops to nearly a whisper. \"In a single afternoon. A king who speaks of church bells and farmers at Mass. A scholar who has waited twenty years for someone to ask what he knows. And a Pope who remembers—finally remembers—why he wanted this throne at all.\"\n\nHe looks up at Juan.\n\n\"You say what We are doing is incredible. Perhaps. But We could not do it alone. We have not done it alone.\" He gestures at Parentucelli, at Juan, at the documents on the desk. \"This is not Our achievement. This is... communion. Three men, in a room, deciding to stop being afraid.\"\n\nHe draws himself up. Something of the papal dignity returns—but warmer now, less defensive.\n\n\"Tomorrow will be difficult. The cardinals will rage. Basel will denounce Us. The Colonna and Orsini will scheme. There will be moments when We doubt. When We wish We had remained silent, remained safe, remained the frightened Pope who asked nothing and risked nothing.\"\n\nHis eyes meet Juan's.\n\n\"When those moments come—and they will come—We will remember this night. This room. The King of Castile, kneeling to pledge his sword to a cause not his own. The scholar from Sarzana, setting aside his fury for the sake of victory. And a Pope who finally stopped running.\"\n\nHe reaches out and grips Juan's arm—the same gesture from hours ago, when he first began to believe.\n\n\"Thank you.\" The words are simple. Raw. \"Whatever comes tomorrow, thank you. For seeing what We might become. For refusing to let Us remain what We were.\"\n\nHe releases Juan's arm and turns to Parentucelli.\n\n\"And you, Tommaso. Our Commissarius Extraordinarius.\" A ghost of a smile. \"We suspect you will make Us uncomfortable many times in the months ahead. You will tell Us things We do not wish to hear. You will find rot We would prefer not to know about. You will be... relentless.\"\n\nHis smile widens slightly.\n\n\"Good. We have had enough men who tell Us what We wish to hear. We need men who tell Us the truth.\"\n\nHe looks at the window. The light has faded almost entirely now. Evening has come to Rome.\n\n\"But first, before We draft the final decree—\" He moves toward the small bell on the side table. \"We should have candles. And perhaps more wine. The night is young, and We have a Church to reform.\"\n\nHe rings the bell.\n\n\"Let us continue.\""

For everything.\"\n\nEugenius raises his hand in blessing as Juan departs. \"Benedicat te omnipotens Deus, Pater et Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.\"\n\nThe Vatican corridors are empty at this hour. Juan's footsteps echo against ancient stone as a single papal guard leads him through darkened passages toward the entrance where his escort waits. The torches burn low in their sconces, casting long shadows that dance and flicker.\n\nOutside, the March night is cold. Rome spreads before him—a city of domes and towers, of palazzos and ruins, all silver-blue under a crescent moon. Somewhere in those darkened buildings, cardinals sleep in their silk sheets, unaware that the world they know is about to end.\n\nHis horse waits. A dozen Castilian knights materialize from the shadows, hands on sword hilts until they recognize their king.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" Captain Álvarez's voice is low. \"We were beginning to worry.\"\n\n\"A long audience.\" Juan swings into the saddle. \"Much was accomplished.\"\n\nThey ride through silent streets. Rome at night is a different city—the daytime crowds vanished, the markets empty, only the occasional cat slinking between buildings and the distant bark of dogs. The Tiber gleams black as they cross the bridge toward Trastevere.\n\nThe Palazzo di San Marco is dark save for a single window on the upper floor. Lucia's window. Still lit, despite the hour.\n\nShe is waiting.\n\nJuan finds her in the small sitting room adjoining their chambers, wrapped in a heavy robe against the night chill. A book lies open in her lap, but her eyes are on the door when he enters.\n\n\"Nine hours.\" Her voice carries no accusation—only observation, and beneath it, relief. \"I was about to send men to inquire.\"\n\nShe rises, moving toward him. Her hand finds his cheek, her eyes searching his face.\n\n\"You look... different.\" She studies him. \"What happened in that room, my husband?\"\n\nThe candle burns. Outside, Rome sleeps, unknowing.\n\nTomorrow, everything changes.\n\nEND OF CHAPTER 2.20\n\nShall I prepare a chapter summary?"
