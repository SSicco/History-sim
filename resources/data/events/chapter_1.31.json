I want to grant estates to both loyal nobles who are actual on their taxes. And I want to give them out to new nobility. Those nobles starting their own branches or even proven commoners if they have the capacity. I want to give out all territories that are firmly under our control now, which includes almost all ports, a lot of forts and Malaga as well.

          "text": "1. **Current situation**: It's Chapter 31, after finishing the 1432 budget. Western Granada has been conquered (Málaga, coastal areas, many forts). The plan is to besiege Granada city in 1432 after taking surrounding fortresses (Alhama, Montefrio, etc.)\n\n2. **Álvaro de Luna's character**: \n   - Royal Constable, Juan's closest advisor\n   - From minor nobility but brilliant administrator and strategist\n   - Deeply hated by many nobles as \"low-born upstart\"\n   - Provides candid advice and reality checks\n   - Proved himself during the Infantes' rebellion\n   - When he praises someone or something, it means a lot\n\n3. **What Juan wants to discuss**: Granting estates in western Granada to:\n   - Loyal nobles who pay taxes on time\n   - New nobility (new branches or proven commoners)\n   - All firmly controlled territories (ports, forts, Málaga)\n   - Keeping Málaga's city rights rather than granting it to a noble\n\nThis is a good strategic discussion about feudalization of conquered territories. Álvaro would have strong opinions on this.\n\nNow I need to write Álvaro's response to Juan's proposal. I should:\n- Keep it SHORT (2-4 paragraphs) since this is a conversation\n- Have Álvaro respond thoughtfully to Juan's ideas\n- NOT write what Juan says or does\n- Stop after Álvaro speaks so the player can respond\n\nLet me set the scene briefly and then have Álvaro respond.\n\nCHAPTER 31: The Distribution of Conquest\n\nDate: Late November 1431\nLocation: Royal Palace, Jaén\n\nYou find Álvaro in the administrative chambers overlooking Jaén's ramparts, surrounded by maps of western Granada marked with garrison positions and supply routes. The evening light catches dust motes drifting through the window as he studies the conquered territories with the focused intensity you've come to recognize.\n\nHe looks up as you enter, setting down his quill. \"Your Majesty.\" A slight smile. \"The budget is complete, the Cortes satisfied. Now you're thinking about how to keep what we've taken without bankrupting the crown on garrison costs.\"\n\nWhen you present your proposal—estates for tax-paying nobles and proven newcomers, distributing the ports and fortresses, preserving Málaga's municipal rights—Álvaro's eyes narrow thoughtfully. He traces a finger along the coastal fortifications on the map.\n\n\"It's brilliant,\" he says flatly. \"And it solves multiple problems at once.\" He taps Málaga. \"Keep the city's fuero—smart. A grateful merchant city pays better taxes than a grasping lord. They'll defend their own privileges fiercely.\" His finger moves to the smaller coastal forts. \"These? Perfect for rewarding loyalty. A fortress on the coast, productive hinterlands, trade income—valuable enough to inspire competition among nobles for your favor.\"\n\nHe straightens, arms crossed. \"The new nobility angle—that's where you'll face resistance. Every old house will scream about 'upstarts' and 'diluting noble blood.'\" A dry smile. \"I'd know something about that. But Your Majesty, it's also your shrewdest move. Create nobles who owe everything to you, not ancient family alliances. They'll be loyal because their legitimacy depends on your continued favor.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds: \"Three questions before we proceed: First, how do we define 'loyal' and 'current on taxes' without seeming arbitrary? Second, what size estates are we considering—and do recipients provide their own garrisons, or do we subsidize? Third—\" his tone sharpens slightly \"—have you thought about who specifically you want elevated to new nobility? Because that decision will echo for generations.\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts on his questions?"

Some nobles have just been cooperating with the taxes, some have shown to be more obstructionist. That's fine, but I am not going to reward them. We make new titles for them with regular revenue assessments and an 8% tax on their revenue. We support them with maintaining order, especially in the coming years.\n\nWe give out everything we hold in Grenada that are uncontested. Some farms near the vega are not fully under our control for example. Like I said, we support them in the beginning, but they should start maintaining order immediately.\n\nI have no specific nobles in mind except for Don Rodrigo holding Ronda at the moment. Like I said, lesser nobility that have proven to be loyal, plus the main branch of the Mendoza's who have been supporting us. But remember we have yet more lands to distribute. Soon I have to divide the estates of the three rebels as well and I intend to use the same metric when distributing these lands.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore questions?"

Lesser nobility who've been loyal\n8. More lands coming from rebel estates\n\nÁlvaro would likely:\n- Appreciate the decisiveness\n- Want clarification on some practical details\n- Think about the political implications\n- Consider the rebel estates separately\n- Maybe suggest a formal structure or process\n\nI should keep this relatively short since we're in an active planning conversation. Maybe 3-5 paragraphs. Stop after Álvaro's questions/suggestions so Juan can respond.\n\nÁlvaro nods sharply at your assertion of royal prerogative. \"Good. The moment you start asking nobles for permission to distribute conquered land, you've already lost.\" He returns his attention to the map, making quick notations.\n\n\"The 8% rate—consistent with what we just passed through Cortes. That eliminates any complaint about 'special burdens.'\" He traces the western coast with his finger. \"Málaga, Marbella, Estepona, Vélez-Málaga, the interior fortresses... that's substantial territory. Enough to create perhaps fifteen to twenty significant holdings, depending on how we divide them.\"\n\nHe looks up. \"Don Rodrigo and the Mendozas—agreed without question. Rodrigo's earned Ronda three times over, and rewarding the main Mendoza branch sends exactly the right message about what cooperation brings.\" A pause. \"For the lesser nobility and potential newcomers, do you want me to prepare a list of candidates? Younger sons of loyal houses, proven military commanders from the crusade, perhaps a few of the more capable converso families who've been generous with funds?\"\n\nHis expression grows more serious. \"The rebel estates are a different matter entirely. Baron de Medina, Count of Niebla, Medina-Sidonia—those are major holdings in western Castile. Extremely valuable. Redistributing those will send shockwaves through every noble house in the kingdom.\" He meets your eyes directly. \"That's when the old nobility will truly understand what cooperation versus obstruction means under your reign. It could cement your authority permanently—or trigger desperate resistance from those who see themselves as next.\"\n\nHe sets down his quill. \"So: practical sequence. Do we announce the Granada distributions now, at this Cortes while we have momentum? Or wait until after we've dealt with the rebels in February, then distribute everything together as one clear statement of your new order?\""

Through the window, Toledo's winter sun casts pale light across the Tagus. Upstairs, Isabel rests with your newborn daughter Catalina. The wet nurse and physicians assure you both are recovering well, though Isabel remains weak.\n\nÁlvaro has been managing the final preparations for the rebel campaign while you've stayed close to your family these past weeks. Now, with departure looming in days, you turn to the question of the Granada estates.\n\n\"Seville,\" Álvaro repeats, nodding. \"After we've taken their fortresses and they've surrendered or been defeated. Public ceremony, immediate oaths of loyalty, clear consequences visible to all.\" He makes a note. \"I'll compile the full list of available Granada titles and ensure the candidates are summoned to Seville for late March or early April, depending on how quickly the rebels fold.\"\n\nHe pauses, considering the Castilian estates. \"The rebel lands... you're right to be cautious. We're talking about Baron de Medina, Count of Niebla, and Medina-Sidonia's holdings. Stripping them completely and giving everything to newcomers or rivals would terrify every major house in Castile—they'd see themselves as potentially next.\" He taps the table thoughtfully. \"Perhaps keep some lands in family hands—younger brothers or cousins who weren't part of the rebellion? Shows you're punishing treason, not destroying lineages. The rest we can redistribute as reward for loyalty.\"\n\nOn the converso families: \"Excellent. A visible demonstration that conversion and loyalty lead to nobility. That message will resonate across Granada's conquered territories—and perhaps encourage more peaceful surrenders when we move on the capital.\" A slight smile. \"Though I imagine some old Christian nobles will grumble about 'New Christians' rising too fast.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"One practical question: the Granada estates we're distributing—do you want me to gather intelligence on which specific nobles from the lesser houses have been most reliable on taxes and most cooperative with royal authority?

I should capture Fra Angelico's character: humble, deeply spiritual, sees beauty as testimony to divine truth, takes his work very seriously as an act of worship.\n\nÁlvaro's eyebrows rise slightly—clearly not expecting such immediate enthusiasm—but he stands without hesitation. \"Of course, Your Majesty. I'll send a messenger ahead to inform the prior that you're coming.\"\n\nWithin the hour, you're riding through Toledo's winter streets toward the Dominican monastery of Santo Tomás, accompanied by a small escort. The monastery sits on the city's edge, a severe stone structure that seems to embody the Dominican commitment to learning and contemplation.\n\nThe prior greets you personally at the gate, bowing deeply. \"Your Majesty, Fra Giovanni is in the chapter house where we've given him workspace. He's been... quite absorbed in his preparations.\" There's fondness in the old prior's voice. \"He asked me to apologize in advance if he seems distracted—when he works, he prays, and when he prays, he is not always present to earthly conversation.\"\n\nThe prior leads you through quiet cloisters to a large room flooded with northern light. The space has been transformed into a painter's workshop—panels of prepared wood lean against walls, jars of pigments line a table in careful rows, and dozens of drawings cover every surface.\n\nFra Giovanni da Fiesole stands before a large drawing board, his Dominican habit paint-stained, a piece of charcoal in his hand. He's perhaps forty-five, thin and ascetic, with an intensity in his dark eyes that speaks of someone who sees beyond the material world. When he notices you, he sets down the charcoal immediately and bows—not with courtly flourish, but with genuine reverence.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His voice is quiet, accented Italian. \"Forgive me—I did not hear you arrive. I was...\" he gestures at the drawing before him, \"...trying to understand how the light fell on the banner during your wedding. The prior described it, but I wanted to see if I could capture the moment when sacred objects make light itself holy.\"\n\nHe steps aside so you can see his work. The drawing shows the cathedral interior with remarkable precision—every column, every arch—but what strikes you is how he's sketched rays of light falling across the white banner and the reliquaries, as if the light itself were bowing before the holy objects.\n\n\"I have many questions for Your Majesty,\" Fra Giovanni says, his eyes meeting yours with unexpected directness. \"But first—may I ask why you wanted this painted? Not for posterity, I think. Not for glory. There is another reason.\"\n\nHe waits for your answer."

Fra Giovanni doesn't rush to fill it. He simply waits, his paint-stained hands folded, his dark eyes attentive.\n\nThrough the tall windows, afternoon light streams across the stone floor, illuminating the dozens of preparatory sketches scattered about—studies of hands holding reliquaries, the fall of fabric, the way candlelight reflects off gold. Everything in this room speaks of a man trying to capture not just appearance, but meaning.\n\nBrother Giuliano's pestle makes soft grinding sounds against the mortar as he works.

          "text": "Let me start at the beginning Fra Giovanni. I have been a king for as long as I can remember. I was crowned as a child and did pretty much everything my advisors told me to. A few years ago I started to think for myself, started to have ideas of my own. It became apparent to me that my nobles did not like that. And that the difference between a good and a bad choice was not the same as following wise council or not. What is really good in this world Fra? What seperates us from a sinful life? It was then that I started to have flashes of what I can only describe as God's kingdom on earth.\n\n\nI dont know what the first vision actually was, but I do remember one very vividly from a few years ago. It is the oldest I can remember. It was an older brother who's family was working at the palace. He had just earned himself half a bread for his work for the day. He gathered his younger siblings around him and divided the bread among them equally. He kept the smaller piece for himself and smiled as he watched his younger brothers and sisters skip away to eat their piece of bread. I saw it Fra, God's grace.\n\n\nI started to see it more often after that. A mother brushing the dust off of her son who has been playing in the forest. A grandfather teaching his grandson how to farm. A stone mason tirelessly labouring away to build a city...and I started to see it in some prayers as well. Some people really pray Fra. It does not happen most of the times but sometimes a prayer is so profound that I just know that a connection with the divine is made.\n\n\nLater I saw this sliver of God's kingdom in my wife as well, which is why her sickness has struck me so hard. And I see it of course in my beautiful daughter. I know that she is just a normal baby like anyone else, but she is sacred to ME. All I want is to build this kingdom higher and close to the image of God's kingdom so that when I die, I leave this world for her to inherit, more just, more fair and closer to heaven than when I found it.\n\n\nBut I get ahead of myself. About two years ago, I saw a vision of what God's kingdom on this earth would look like. I could not stop thinking about it. I knew that as king, I had an obligation to remake my kingdom in his image as much as possible. I started to see the scheming of my nobles for what it really was and I also saw and knew what I had to do. I started on my pilgrimage to rome and what happened after that is public knowledge. My pilgrimage, my father's sword, my meeting with the pope, the crusade, my campain, battles everything. But it all started with this sliver of God's kingdom on earth.\n\n\nI aim to make this world more just and better Fra. It is all I think about. Where me and my wife live happily, and other mothers and fathers as well. And I know we will never reach it. My wife is very sick right now...and may never have another child again. We can only strive towards this goal. But sometimes, we succeed. We succed for just a small fraction of a moment Fra. Blink and it is gone. But in that moment when I see God's grace I can live forever.\n\n\nWhen I was crowned, I was granted the papal bull and all of christendom had rallied to this cause. Isabel was young, beautiful and had yet to endure the ordeal of her pregnancy. The world was full of promise. In that tiny moment, everything was right. In that moment, I felt like I had stepped into God's kingdom.\n\n\nThe painting itself is for my own selfish enjoyment mostly. I know what it represents to me. I hope it will allow me to recollect the moment, to see God's kingdom again like I did at that moment. That it may remind me and give me clarity when I pray before it.\n\n\nAnd maybe, maybe, it can allow others to see it too.\n\n\nThat is what you will be painting Fra."

They want their power immortalized, their victories celebrated. You want me to paint grace.\" He says it not as criticism but as recognition. \"You want me to show the moment when a human ceremony—a wedding, a coronation—became something more. When heaven bent down and touched earth.\"\n\nFra Giovanni approaches one of his sketches—the one showing light falling on the banner. \"I understand now why Pope Martin commanded this on his deathbed. He saw the same thing you do—that for one moment in that cathedral, the Kingdom was present. Really present.\" He looks at you directly. \"This is not a painting of your wedding, Your Majesty. This is a painting of grace made visible.\"\n\nHe pauses, then asks quietly: \"When you saw this moment—when you felt you had stepped into God's kingdom—what was the thing that told you it was real? Was it the light? The faces? Your wife's expression? The banner?\" His voice becomes urgent. \"I must know what made it real to you, or I will paint only appearance, not truth.\""

At the moment itself I saw God's kingdom more through the lens of a king and administrator. All nobles loyal, laws just and fair, the realm united. I had just met my wife and we found common ground in faith. Having her by my side as queen felt right. A wife supporting her husband in her role. And me as husband supporting her in my way. The promise of children and an heir felt so natural back then. It felt like everything was in it's rightful place. Perfect, untainted by worldly disease, pain and suffering. I had never gone to war yet. And Isabel had yet to give birth.\n\n\nWhat do you think when I discribe it like that?"

He would see that Juan has moved from an idealized, somewhat naive vision of \"everything in its place\" to a more mature, more painful understanding of grace—one that acknowledges suffering, limitation, and mortality.\n\nFra Giovanni would probably respond with compassion but also with theological depth. He might point out that Juan's initial vision wasn't wrong, but incomplete. That the Kingdom of God includes both the hope of perfection AND the reality of the cross. That grace is most visible not in the absence of suffering, but in how it transforms suffering.\n\nThis is a crucial character development moment for Juan. He's maturing, becoming less idealistic but more genuinely faithful. Fra Giovanni would recognize this as spiritual growth, not loss.\n\nI should have Fra Giovanni respond with wisdom that both validates Juan's initial vision and helps him understand his current, more complex understanding as deeper rather than as a loss of innocence.\n\nFra Giovanni is silent for a long moment, his eyes searching your face. Then he moves to sit on a simple wooden stool, gesturing for you to sit as well if you wish. Brother Giuliano quietly excuses himself, sensing this conversation requires complete privacy.\n\n\"I think,\" Fra Giovanni says slowly, \"that you saw truly—but you saw as Adam saw Eden before the Fall. Everything in its place, everything as it should be, no shadow of pain or death. A kingdom of pure order and promise.\" He pauses. \"And now you have tasted the apple, Your Majesty. You have seen men die in battle. You have watched your wife suffer in childbirth, perhaps lose the ability to give you more children. You have learned that even when everything is in its 'rightful place,' the world still contains pain.\"\n\nHe leans forward slightly. \"Many men, when they learn this, become cynical. They decide their first vision was childish foolishness. They harden their hearts and say, 'There is no Kingdom, only power and suffering.'\" His eyes intensify. \"But you have not done this. You still believe in those moments of grace—you simply understand them differently now.\"\n\nHe stands and moves to one of his sketches—this one showing your face during the ceremony. \"When I paint the Kingdom made visible, I cannot paint Eden. Eden is gone. What I must paint is...\" he struggles for words, \"...is the Kingdom breaking through despite the shadow of the Cross. Grace that exists even knowing what suffering costs. Hope that survives loss.\"\n\nFra Giovanni turns back to you. \"Your Majesty, the moment in that cathedral was real. But it was not real because everything was perfect—untainted, as you say. It was real because in that moment, you chose to serve something greater than yourself, knowing—even if you did not fully understand it then—that it would cost you everything. That is what made it sacred. Not the absence of suffering, but the decision to love despite knowing suffering will come.\"\n\nHe gestures to his drawings. \"So I ask you again, but differently: In that moment in the cathedral—knowing what you know now, having seen war and birth and loss—what would you want someone looking at this painting to feel? What truth do you want captured?\""

The shift from \"kingdom as perfect administration\" to \"kingdom as love embodied in a suffering, selfless person\" is actually a very Christian insight - it mirrors Christ himself. \n\nFra Giovanni would recognize this as genuine spiritual growth - from seeing the Kingdom as order to seeing it as sacrificial love. This is profound and would move him deeply as both a theologian and an artist.\n\nI need to:\n1. Have Fra Giovanni respond with the depth this deserves\n2. Show that he understands the theological significance\n3. Make clear how this will shape his painting\n4. Keep it in character for a Dominican friar who paints as prayer\n5. This is a short response moment - Fra Giovanni absorbing and responding, not a long scene\n\nThis is beautiful character development for Juan. Isabel, who could have been just a political piece, has become his anchor to understanding divine love through her suffering and selflessness.\n\nFra Giovanni stands very still, and for the first time since you met him, you see his eyes glisten with tears. He makes no move to hide them.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, his voice thick with emotion, \"you have just described the Incarnation. God did not save us by showing us a perfect world untouched by suffering. He saved us by entering our suffering—taking flesh, knowing pain, dying on a Cross—and loving us anyway. Through the suffering, not around it.\"\n\nHe moves to the sketch of Isabel. You hadn't noticed it before, but he's captured her face with extraordinary care—not made beautiful beyond truth, but showing exactly what you just described. The shy devotion. The quiet selflessness. The fragility and the strength together.\n\n\"She is the heart of this painting,\" Fra Giovanni says simply. \"Not the banner. Not the relics. Not even you, Your Majesty—though you are the king and the crusader.\" He touches the drawing gently. \"She is the one who shows what the Kingdom actually is. Not power made perfect, but love made vulnerable. Not glory untouched by sorrow, but grace that persists through it.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"I will paint her as she was in that moment—young, full of promise, before the suffering of childbirth. But I will paint her in such a way that anyone who looks at this painting will understand: this is what is worth protecting. This is what makes the crusade holy. Not conquest. Not even faith as an idea. But faith as embodied in a person who loves without counting the cost.\"\n\nHis voice drops to barely a whisper. \"When you pray before this painting in the years to come, when campaigns have ground you down and kingdoms have disappointed you—you will see her face, and remember why you fight. Not for perfect kingdoms that can never exist in this fallen world. But for people like her, who show us glimpses of Eden even in exile.\"\n\nHe wipes his eyes unselfconsciously. \"Yes, Your Majesty.

Something Isabel could pray before, reminding her that her prayers and Juan's both rise before God's throne.\"\n\nSo Fra Angelico had proposed a devotional piece for Isabel's private chapel showing the Virgin Mary interceding for crusaders. This was meant to be something Isabel could pray before while Juan was away at war.\n\nGiven the conversation we just had about Isabel's nature - her constant prayer for others, her selflessness, her suffering - Fra Angelico would likely have deeper insights about why this second painting is important for her specifically. He would understand that Isabel needs spiritual support while Juan is away at war, and that she prays constantly for him and for his enemies.\n\nI should have Fra Angelico explain his vision for this devotional piece in light of what Juan has just revealed about Isabel's character and their relationship.\n\nFra Giovanni nods, moving to another section of his workspace where a smaller preparatory sketch rests. \"Yes—a devotional piece for the Queen's private chapel. When I proposed it, I knew only that she was pious and that you would be away at war for long periods. But now...\" he looks at the sketch thoughtfully, \"...now I understand her much better.\"\n\nHe picks up the drawing. \"I proposed depicting the Virgin Mary interceding before Christ for crusaders. The theological concept is sound—Mary as advocate, presenting the prayers of the faithful to her Son. But the reason for this painting is Isabel herself.\"\n\nHe turns to you. \"Your Majesty, when you are in Granada leading armies, facing battle, making life and death decisions—who do you think suffers more? The warrior in the field, or the wife in the chapel praying for his safe return?\" He doesn't wait for an answer. \"Both suffer. But the warrior has action. He has purpose visible before him. The wife has only prayer and waiting.\"\n\nFra Giovanni sets the sketch down carefully. \"Isabel will pray for you every day you are gone. She will pray through her own pain, through her recovery, through her fears. She needs to see—visually, tangibly—that her prayers matter. That they reach heaven. That her suffering has purpose.\"\n\nHis voice becomes gentle. \"The Virgin Mary understands what Isabel feels. Mary watched her Son go to war against sin and death itself. She could not fight for Him. She could not protect Him. She could only pray, and trust, and suffer alongside Him.\" He pauses. \"When Isabel prays before this painting, she will see Mary presenting crusaders—presenting you—to Christ. She will know that her prayers are heard. That her vigil has meaning.\"\n\nHe looks at you seriously. \"This painting is not for public display, Your Majesty. This is for her private devotion. For the moments when she is alone, frightened, wondering if prayer is enough. It will tell her: Yes. Your prayers matter. You are not helpless. You are partnering with heaven itself.\"\n\nHe touches the sketch lightly. \"What do you think? Does this serve what she needs?\""

To speak with her about the painting?\" He seems genuinely moved by this. \"Most nobles commission paintings of their wives without consulting them at all. They treat them as... ornaments to be captured.\"\n\nHe looks at you with new understanding. \"You truly see her. Not just love her—see her.\" He crosses himself. \"Yes. I should meet her.

You lead Fra Giovanni and Brother Giuliano up the stairs toward Isabel's chambers, where Dona Beatriz stands guard outside the door.\n\nShe curtsies when she sees you. \"Your Majesty.

After a moment, she returns. \"The Queen will receive you, Your Majesty. She asks only a moment to... compose herself.\"\n\nWhen you finally enter, Isabel is sitting in a chair by the window, sunlight falling across her face. She's dressed simply in a modest gown, her hair braided loosely. Little Catalina sleeps in a cradle beside her. Isabel looks pale and tired, but her eyes are clear. When she sees the two Dominican friars, she immediately moves to rise.\n\n\"Please, Your Majesty—don't,\" Fra Giovanni says quickly, bowing deeply. \"You are recovering. We are honored you receive us at all.\"\n\nIsabel settles back, her hands folded in her lap. She looks at you questioningly, then at the painter, waiting."

How your armor caught and reflected that light.\"\n\nBrother Giuliano speaks up quietly for the first time. \"Master, you will also need sittings with Their Majesties for the faces.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Fra Giovanni nods. \"I will need perhaps three or four sessions with each of you—not long, an hour or two at a time. Your Majesty,\" he addresses you, \"I would like to sketch you in your armor, with your father's sword. And you, Your Majesty,\" to Isabel, \"I will need you in your wedding gown, or something similar, so I can capture how the fabric falls and how the light touches your face.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"How much time do I have before you depart for the campaign, Your Majesty?\""

Francesco Sforza revolutionized Italian combined-arms warfare. The German knights bring traditional heavy cavalry doctrine. We can synthesize all of this.\"\n\nHe moves to the door. \"I'll send messengers immediately. Gather everyone at the Military Academy tomorrow morning?

Hunyadi's intelligence on Ottoman methods could be invaluable when we eventually look beyond Granada.\"\n\n\"Shall I arrange for tomorrow morning?

Captain de Metz and the condottieri can make it if they leave within two days. The foreign troops themselves will march to join the Seville army—they'll be invaluable for the rebel campaign.\"\n\nHe looks up. \"For the academy students, I'll select from younger sons of loyal noble houses—men in their late teens and early twenties who need positions but won't inherit.

The ongoing conflict between Pope and Council\n\nI should be careful to:\n- Not generate Juan's dialogue or decisions\n- Present the church officials' perspectives\n- Stop when Juan needs to respond\n- Keep it historically grounded in the conciliar controversy\n\nEARLIER IN FEBRUARY 1432\nLocation: Chapter House, Cathedral of Toledo\n\nThe assembled churchmen fill the vaulted chamber—the most important ecclesiastical gathering in Castile in recent memory. Álvaro had summoned them weeks ago at your request, and they've traveled from across the kingdom.\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez Álvarez de Toledo sits at the head of the table in his capacity as Primate of Spain, flanked by a dozen bishops and abbots. The mood is tense. Everyone knows what's at stake in Basel.\n\nThe Archbishop rises when you enter, and the assembly bows. \"Your Majesty. We are assembled as you requested, to discuss the Council of Basel and Castile's participation.\"\n\nHe gestures for you to take the seat of honor. Once you're settled, he continues: \"Your Majesty, the situation in Basel grows more troubling by the week. Pope Eugenius IV attempted to dissolve the council in December, but the assembled prelates refused to disperse. They've declared that councils derive authority directly from Christ—not from the Pope—and therefore the Holy Father cannot dissolve them.\"\n\nBishop Álvaro de Isorna of Cuenca, an older man with sharp eyes, leans forward. \"This is the Hussite heresy all over again, Your Majesty. First they question papal authority in Bohemia. Now French and German bishops question it at Basel. Where does it end?\"\n\nBut the Bishop of Palencia, younger and more reform-minded, counters: \"With respect, my lord of Cuenca, the Council raises legitimate concerns about church governance. The Pope cannot reform the church alone—we've seen how personal interests corrupt. The councils provide checks against abuse.\"\n\nThe Archbishop raises his hand, forestalling argument. \"We are not here to debate the theological merits, brothers. We are here because His Majesty must decide: Does Castile send representatives to Basel? And if so, what position do they take?\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"Your Majesty, you have unique standing. Pope Martin V blessed your crusade personally. Cardinal Capranica served as your legate. You have papal favor unlike any Iberian monarch in living memory.\" He pauses. \"But the new Pope Eugenius and the Council are at war. You cannot remain neutral. Whatever we do will be noticed in Rome and in Basel.\"\n\nWhat do you say to them?"

Let me explain the crisis we face.\"\n\nHe settles back in his chair. \"The issue is not whether we are Christians—we all are. The question is: Who governs the Church? Does ultimate authority rest with the Pope alone, as Vicar of Christ? Or with councils of bishops, who claim to speak for the whole Church?\"\n\nBishop Alfonso de Cartagena of Burgos, known as one of Castile's finest scholars, speaks up. \"Your Majesty, to understand the present, we must remember the recent past. From 1378 to 1417—nearly forty years—the Church was torn by schism. Two popes, sometimes three, all claiming to be the true successor of Peter. Rome had one pope, Avignon another. Christendom was divided, each pope excommunicating the other's followers.\"\n\nThe Bishop of Palencia continues the history: \"The Council of Constance, which met from 1414 to 1418, resolved this crisis. But how? The council deposed all three competing popes and elected a new one—Pope Martin V, who blessed your crusade. The council declared that it possessed authority directly from Christ, and that even popes must submit to it in matters of faith and church reform.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez adds: \"The council issued a decree called Haec Sancta—'This Holy Synod.' It stated that councils have their power directly from Christ, and that everyone, including the Pope, must obey them. It also decreed regular councils must be held—every ten years at minimum.\"\n\nBishop de Isorna interjects sharply: \"But Pope Martin V never fully accepted these decrees! He viewed the Council of Constance as an emergency measure during schism, not a permanent change in church governance. He believed that once the crisis passed, normal papal supremacy should resume.\"\n\nThe younger Bishop of Ávila speaks carefully: \"And that, Your Majesty, is the heart of our current crisis. Pope Eugenius IV sees Basel as a threat to his authority. The council is demanding reforms—reduction of papal taxes, limits on papal appointments, financial accountability. The Pope views this as rebellion. The council views it as legitimate governance.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez looks at you soberly: \"So when you ask 'why do some Christians doubt the office of the Pope'—they don't doubt the office exists. They question whether the Pope stands above the Church, or within it subject to councils. It's a fundamental question about the very structure of Christendom.\"\n\nBishop de Cartagena adds: \"And Your Majesty, there are legitimate concerns on both sides. Without strong papal authority, we risk returning to schism—local churches going their own way, unity shattered. But without conciliar checks, we risk papal tyranny—corruption, nepotism, worldly ambition unchecked.\"\n\nThe room falls quiet, waiting for your response to this explanation.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?"

They would balance respect for the papal office with historical reality.\n\nThis is a teaching moment for Juan about the institutional church versus spiritual ideals.\n\nA heavy silence falls over the chamber. The churchmen exchange glances—some uncomfortable, others resigned. Finally, Archbishop Gutiérrez speaks with careful honesty.\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. Even popes.\"\n\nHe stands and moves to the window, looking out over Toledo. \"The office of the papacy is sacred—the unbroken line from Saint Peter to today. But the men who hold that office remain men, subject to temptation like all of us.\" He turns back to you. \"Pope Martin V, who blessed you so generously, was by all accounts a holy man. But even he was not above criticism. He appointed five of his own relatives as cardinals. He enriched his family, the Colonnas, beyond measure.\"\n\nBishop de Cartagena speaks gently, as if explaining something painful: \"Your Majesty, in the past century alone we have seen popes who were warriors first and priests second. Pope Julius II will be remembered as much for leading armies as for spiritual leadership. Some popes have had mistresses, acknowledged bastard children, sold church offices to the highest bidder.\"\n\nThe Bishop of Palencia adds: \"The current Pope Eugenius IV—by all accounts a decent man—dissolved the Council of Basel partly because it threatened his family's interests in Florence. The Condulmer family benefits greatly from his papacy. Is that worldly ambition? Or legitimate concern for his kinsmen?\"\n\nBishop de Isorna, the conservative, feels compelled to defend: \"But Your Majesty, we must distinguish between the office and the man! Even if individual popes sin—and they do, for all have sinned and fall short—the authority of the Keys remains. Christ promised the gates of Hell would not prevail against His Church. That promise holds regardless of human weakness.\"\n\nThe Abbott of San Benito de Valladolid, who has been silent until now, speaks with the quiet authority of age: \"Your Majesty, I am seventy-three years old. I have lived under seven popes. Some were saints. Some were scoundrels. Most were men trying their best while struggling with power, wealth, and pride.\" He looks at you with kind eyes. \"The question before Basel is not whether popes can be corrupt—history proves they can. The question is: what structure best protects the Church when they are?\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez returns to his seat. \"Your Majesty, you met Pope Martin V at perhaps his finest moment—a dying man making peace with God, using his last strength to bless a true crusade. You saw the best of what the papacy can be.\" He pauses. \"But the office has not always been held by men like that. And it may not be again.\"\n\nHe folds his hands. \"The conciliarists at Basel argue that regular councils of bishops—men who cannot all be corrupted at once—provide better governance than one man with absolute power, however holy that office may be. The papalists argue that strong central authority is the only thing preventing chaos and heresy.\"\n\nThe room waits. Your question has opened a difficult truth: the Church you love and serve is governed by fallible men, even at its highest levels.\n\nHow does this revelation sit with you?"

Castile was historically very loyal to Rome - they benefited from papal authority\n3. The Spanish church was quite conservative and would be suspicious of Basel\n4. Many Castilian bishops would see the Hussites as dangerous heretics, not reformers\n5. The conciliar movement would be viewed with suspicion by many\n6. There would be much more diversity of opinion - some hardliners, some moderates, maybe a few sympathetic to reform\n\nThe player is absolutely right. I made the churchmen too uniformly pragmatic and balanced. In reality:\n- Many would be horrified by Basel's challenge to papal authority\n- The Castilian church benefited from Rome's centralized system\n- They would fear that weakening the Pope weakens church hierarchy generally\n- Most would be very anti-Hussite\n- There should be more conservative voices defending absolute papal authority\n- Only a minority would be sympathetic to conciliar reforms\n\nI need to rewind and present a more historically accurate, diverse gathering where:\n- Conservative bishops dominate (defending papal supremacy)\n- A few moderate reformers exist but are in minority\n- Strong anti-Hussite sentiment\n- Fear that Basel leads to chaos and heresy\n- Concern about what reforms might mean for Spanish church privileges\n\nThe player caught an important historical inaccuracy. Let me acknowledge this and restart the scene with more accurate characterization.\n\nYou're absolutely right to call this out. Let me restart this scene with a more historically accurate representation.\n\nThe Castilian clergy in 1432 would be predominantly conservative and pro-papal. Castile benefited enormously from strong papal authority—the reconquista was justified by papal bulls, church wealth and privileges were protected by Rome, and the Spanish church hierarchy had a vested interest in maintaining the Roman system. They would be deeply suspicious of Basel and horrified by the Hussites.\n\nLet me revise:\n\nREWIND - THE CHURCH COUNCIL (Earlier in February 1432)\n\nThe assembled churchmen fill the chamber, and the atmosphere is considerably more tense and fractious than I initially portrayed.\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez opens: \"Your Majesty, we are gathered to discuss a grave threat to Holy Mother Church. The Council of Basel has defied Pope Eugenius IV and claims authority above the Holy Father himself.\"\n\nBishop Álvaro de Isorna of Cuenca speaks immediately, his voice hard: \"Your Majesty, this is heresy masquerading as reform. These so-called conciliarists echo the Hussites—questioning legitimate authority, sowing discord, threatening the very structure Christ established when He gave the Keys to Peter.\"\n\nThe Bishop of León stands, angry: \"The Hussites have defeated five crusades! Five! They burn churches, murder priests, reject the sacraments—and now Basel negotiates with them as equals? This is madness! The Church militant should crush heresy, not debate it!\"\n\nSeveral bishops murmur agreement. The mood is hostile to Basel.\n\nBut then Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena of Burgos—the scholar—speaks more carefully: \"My brothers, we must distinguish between the Hussites' heretical teachings and Basel's legitimate concerns about church governance. The Council of Constance did establish precedent for conciliar authority during the Great Schism—\"\n\n\"An emergency measure!\" Bishop de Isorna interrupts. \"Not a permanent revolution in church government! The moment the schism ended, normal papal supremacy should have resumed!\"\n\nThe young Bishop of Palencia tries to interject: \"But surely reforms are needed—the sale of offices, the nepotism—\"\n\n\"Do you dare criticize the Holy Father?\" the Bishop of Ávila snaps. \"This is how heresy begins—questioning, doubting, undermining. Today Basel, tomorrow every diocese claims independence from Rome!\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez raises his hand for order. The room is clearly divided, but the conservatives vastly outnumber the few moderate voices.\n\nHow do you want to respond to this more accurately fractious and conservative gathering?"
