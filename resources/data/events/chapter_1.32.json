He delivers a speech reaffirming his faith, referencing his relationship with the late Pope Martin V, his crusading zeal, and his desire to act for the right reasons. The bishops react with division: conservatives like Bishop de Isorna and Bishop of Leon favor rejecting Basel outright, while moderates like Bishop de Cartagena and Archbishop Gutierrez see value in engagement.",

Continue the scene with the cardinals debating Basel\n4. Follow all the rules - especially NEVER write Juan's dialogue or actions\n5. Keep responses SHORT during active dialogue scenes (2-4 paragraphs)\n6. Stop when Juan needs to respond\n\nLet me search the project knowledge for Chapter 31 and the Council of Basel context.\n\n1. The fundamental crisis between papal authority and conciliar authority\n2. The history of the Great Schism and Council of Constance\n3. That popes CAN be corrupted - Juan asked this question with genuine shock\n4. The two positions: Conciliarists vs Papalists\n\nThe scene ended with the council being \"fractious\" - divided between conservatives who are hostile to Basel and a few moderates trying to argue for nuance. Bishop de Isorna was sharply critical, Bishop de Cartagena tried to be scholarly, and it was getting heated.\n\nJuan is still listening. I need to continue this debate scene. Since this is active dialogue, I should keep it SHORT (2-4 paragraphs) and stop after the NPCs speak so Juan can respond.\n\nLet me continue the heated debate with more voices weighing in.\n\nPerfect, I have the full context. In Chapter 31, the debate became increasingly heated. The conservatives were dominating, led by Bishop de Isorna and others attacking Basel as heresy. A few moderates like Bishop de Cartagena tried to defend the council's legitimacy, but were being shut down.\n\nNow I need to continue this fractious debate. Juan is still listening. Since this is an active dialogue/debate scene, I need to keep it SHORT (2-4 paragraphs) and stop after the NPCs speak.\n\nI should show more of the heated debate continuing, with maybe another voice or two weighing in, then present a natural stopping point for Juan to respond or react.\n\nLooking at who was present:\n- Archbishop Gutiérrez (presiding, trying to maintain order)\n- Bishop de Isorna (conservative, hostile)\n- Bishop de Cartagena (scholarly moderate)\n- Bishop of Palencia (younger, reform-minded)\n- Bishop of León (hostile to Basel)\n- Bishop of Ávila (conservative)\n- Abbott of Valladolid (age 73, experienced)\n\nThe Abbott gave that wise perspective about having lived under seven popes. Let me continue with perhaps the Archbishop trying to bring focus back to Castile's practical position, since they're getting lost in the theoretical debate.\n\nChapter 32: The Council Divided\n\nLate February 1432\nToledo Cathedral Chapter House\n\nThe Abbott of Valladolid's words hung in the heavy air. Several bishops shifted uncomfortably—his frank acknowledgment of papal corruption made them uneasy even as they knew it to be true.\n\nBishop de Isorna stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the stone floor. \"This is precisely what Basel wants—to undermine faith in the Holy Father by cataloging every human failing! Yes, popes are men. Yes, they sin. But that does NOT give bishops the right to place themselves ABOVE the successor of Saint Peter!\" His voice echoed off the vaulted ceiling. \"The Council of Constance was an emergency measure during schism—nothing more. Basel perverts it into permanent revolution!\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez raised both hands, his voice cutting through the rising murmurs. \"Brothers. We are not here to relitigate church history. His Majesty has asked us a direct question: Should Castile send representatives to Basel?\" He turned to face you fully. \"And more importantly—if we do, what position should they take?\"\n\nThe room fell silent. All eyes fixed on you."

When I committed everything to the church, the Hussite heresy was exactly one of the reasons why I felt like the church needed a faithful kingdom to represent it's spiritual interests in the material world.\n\n\nI have since then seem much of the world. I have seen justice and cruelty. Honour and betrayal. I have seen my Isabel suffer more than anyone ever should while she is the lord's most devout and innocent follower. I have fought against the Moors and I have also found some who are more honourable than some of those who claim to be christian. Do not misunderstand me, my zeal to drive out Islam has never been stronger. But in some cases claiming to be a good christian is simply not enough.\n\n\nMy first instinct is to lead the armies of Castille against Prague as soon as we are done in Grenada. I will lead them myself and make sure the armies of Christ are not defeated. But we must be absolutely sure and go to war for the right reasons.\n\n\nThat is why I have summoned you. This council of Basel seems like an important event and my first instict is that we should at least be present. But maybe I am wrong. Maybe my first instinct is wrong. What should we do?\n\n\nThe above is Juan's speech at the gathering of Castille's top clergy. Be realistic and historic. Would they be on the Vatican's side? Generate a response with this in mind. Be historic and realistic."

          "text": "Juan's speech includes:\n1. Reaffirms his deep faith and connection to Pope Martin V\n2. States Hussite heresy was a major reason for his crusade commitment\n3. Shares personal reflections on seeing both justice and cruelty, honor and betrayal\n4. Mentions Isabel's suffering despite her devotion\n5. Acknowledges finding honor among some Moors, more than some Christians\n6. Clarifies his zeal against Islam remains strong\n7. States his first instinct is to lead armies against Prague after Granada\n8. But wants to be sure and go to war for right reasons\n9. Thinks Castile should be present at Basel\n10. Asks for their counsel\n\nNow, historically and realistically, how would Spanish bishops in 1432 react?\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT:\n- Spanish church was generally very conservative and loyal to Rome\n- The Reconquista created a deeply militant Catholic identity in Iberia\n- Spanish bishops benefited from royal support and papal authority\n- They were suspicious of anything that smacked of heresy or questioning authority\n- The Hussite heresy was seen as extremely dangerous - these were heretics who DEFEATED crusades\n- Basel was actively negotiating with Hussites as equals, which would horrify conservative Spanish prelates\n- However, some reform-minded clergy did exist, especially scholars\n\nBased on the project documents, the council is \"fractious\" with \"conservative voices vastly outnumbering moderates.\" The mood is \"decidedly hostile to Basel.\"\n\nGiven Juan's speech:\n- His reaffirmation of faith would be well-received\n- His commitment against Hussites would be strongly approved\n- His nuanced comments about seeing honor in Moors and cruelty in Christians might make some uncomfortable\n- His openness to questioning and wanting \"right reasons\" might worry the ultra-conservatives\n- His suggestion to attend Basel would be divisive\n \nThe clergy's response would be deeply divided. Conservative bishops would react with alarm to Juan's nuanced perspective, seeing potential weakness in his willingness to question traditional approaches. They would push for immediate military action against the Hussites, viewing any negotiation as dangerous capitulation. The scholarly faction would be intrigued by Juan's complex observations, potentially seeing an opportunity for deeper theological examination. Moderates would cautiously support a measured approach, recognizing the political and religious complexities of the moment.\n\nThe underlying tension would center on Castile's strategic position. Some would argue that attending the Basel Council could provide critical diplomatic leverage, while others would fear legitimizing what they saw as a potentially heretical gathering. Juan's careful balancing act would create visible discomfort among the more hardline ecclesiastical leaders, who preferred straightforward condemnation to intellectual exploration.\n\nThe immediate political calculus would revolve around papal relations and the kingdom's reputation for orthodoxy. Conservative voices would dominate the initial discussion, pushing for a strong, uncompromising stance that would demonstrate Castile's commitment to Catholic unity. Yet, the nuanced perspectives would create an undercurrent of intellectual tension, revealing the complex political and theological landscape of the moment.\n\nYour words create an immediate stir. Bishop de Isorna's expression shifts from hostility to something like satisfaction—your declaration about leading armies to Prague clearly pleases him. Several of the conservative bishops nod approvingly at your commitment to crush the Hussites militarily.\n\nBut Archbishop Gutiérrez studies you with shrewd eyes, clearly noting the careful threading of your speech—the reaffirmation of crusading zeal alongside your admission of complexity, your willingness to question first instincts, your observation that claiming Christianity is sometimes not enough.\n\nBishop of León stands, his voice carrying the certainty of a man who has never doubted. \"Your Majesty speaks of leading armies to Bohemia—this is what the Church needs! Not councils that negotiate with heretics as equals, but Christian kings willing to wield the sword! Basel has failed where you would succeed. They talk while Prague burns churches. They debate while monks are murdered.\" His fist strikes the table. \"Castile should send no one to Basel except perhaps to rebuke them for their weakness!\"\n\nBut Bishop de Cartagena rises more slowly, the scholar's measured tones a contrast to León's passion. \"Your Majesty asks the right question—should we be certain, and act for right reasons? This is wisdom.\" He glances at his more conservative brothers. \"Five crusades have failed against the Hussites. Five. Perhaps—just perhaps—we should understand why before committing Castilian blood to a sixth defeat. If Basel can teach us that, is attendance not prudent?\"\n\n\"Prudent?\" Bishop de Ávila's voice drips scorn. \"Or is it contamination? Your Majesty speaks of honor found among Moors—\" several bishops shift uncomfortably at this \"—but at least Moors do not pretend to be Christian while undermining the Church from within! Basel is worse than open heresy. It is rot at the heart!\"\n\nThe younger Bishop of Palencia attempts to interject: \"But the Holy Father did call the council initially—\"\n\n\"And then dissolved it when he saw what it became!\" Bishop de Isorna snaps. \"They refused to obey. That alone tells you everything.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez raises his hand for silence, then turns to you. The room quiets, waiting.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks what we should do.\" His voice carries the weight of his office as Primate of Spain. \"The bishops are divided, as you see. Some counsel absolute loyalty to Pope Eugenius and rejection of Basel's defiance. Others see value in understanding the situation before committing Castile to any position.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his words with visible care. \"But there is perhaps a middle path. We could send observers—not delegates pledging support to Basel's rebellion, but representatives to watch, listen, and report. This would allow Castile to remain informed without endorsing either side prematurely.\" His eyes meet yours. \"Though I confess, Your Majesty, even this moderate course will be seen as a choice by both Rome and Basel. There is no true neutrality in this conflict.\"\n\nThe question hangs in the air: What will you decide?"

          "text": "The bishops would have different views on the legal validity:\n- Conservatives would argue: emergency measures, not permanent law, Pope never ratified them fully\n- Moderates would argue: formal decrees of ecumenical council, legally binding\n- The question of whether a council's decrees bind a pope is THE question\n\nBishop de Cartagena would be the best person to address this as he's the scholar. Archbishop Gutiérrez might also weigh in as the most senior and politically astute.\n\nThis should be a substantive legal/theological debate, showing the real complexity of the issue. The conservatives would be uncomfortable with this line of questioning because it exposes the weakness of the papalist position - if Constance was valid (which it had to be to end the schism), then its decrees are valid. But they'll argue about interpretation and intent.\n\nKeep responses short during this dialogue - just the relevant bishops speaking, then stop for Juan's next question.\n\nBishop de Cartagena straightens, clearly in his element now that the question has turned to legal matters. \"Your Majesty asks precisely the right question.\" He glances at his fellow bishops. \"The Council of Constance issued two critical decrees. The first, Haec Sancta, declared that councils possess authority directly from Christ and that even the Pope must obey them in matters of faith, schism, and reform. The second, Frequens, mandated regular councils—the next within five years, another seven years after that, then every ten years thereafter.\"\n\nBishop de Isorna interrupts sharply: \"Emergency measures! The Church was in chaos—three popes, each excommunicating the others' followers! Constance did what was necessary to end the schism, but—\"\n\n\"But,\" de Cartagena continues smoothly, \"the question is whether those decrees were valid only during the emergency, or whether they established permanent church law.\" He turns to you. \"Your Majesty, this is the heart of the dispute. Pope Martin V never formally repudiated Haec Sancta or Frequens—he could not, for that would undermine the very council that gave him legitimacy as Pope. But neither did he enthusiastically embrace them.\"\n\nThe Abbott of Valladolid speaks up, his aged voice thoughtful. \"I was present when Martin V called this council at Basel. He did so in explicit fulfillment of Frequens. The decree required it. But when Eugenius dissolved the council...\" He spreads his hands. \"If Frequens is valid law, he had no authority to dissolve it. If it was merely an emergency measure, then he did.\"\n\nBishop de Ávila's face reddens. \"This is sophistry! The Pope is Christ's Vicar on Earth! He cannot be bound by—\"\n\n\"By a decree of an ecumenical council?\" de Cartagena asks quietly. \"Then was Constance not truly ecumenical? And if not, how did it have authority to end the schism and elect Martin V?\"\n\nA heavy silence falls. The conservative bishops shift uncomfortably—de Cartagena has cornered them in the logical contradiction at the heart of the papalist position.\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez observes you carefully, waiting to see where you will take this line of inquiry."

          "text": "SUCCESS FACTORS:\n1. Juan's framing is extremely clever - he's separated the legal question from the policy question, allowing conservatives to admit Basel's legal right to exist without endorsing its positions\n2. He's directly addressed Bishop de Ávila respectfully, acknowledging his opposition will be discussed \"at length\" - this shows he's taking conservative concerns seriously\n3. He's asking for clarity on law before action - this is exactly the kind of prudent, thoughtful approach these bishops should appreciate\n4. His earlier speech showed both crusading zeal (pleasing conservatives) AND willingness to think carefully (pleasing moderates)\n5. He explicitly said he takes faith seriously and was shaped by Pope Martin V - establishing his credentials\n6. He's demonstrated he listens and processes their arguments (the Constance legal point)\n7. By asking for \"this council's opinion\" he's giving them collective authority and respect\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n1. The conservatives are deeply uncomfortable with any acknowledgment of conciliar authority\n2. Bishop de Ávila and others are emotionally invested in papal supremacy - legal logic may not matter\n3. Admitting Basel has legal right to exist feels like betraying the Pope to some\n4. The room is predominantly conservative and hostile to Basel\n5. Some may see Juan's question as a trap or as him being too sympathetic to Basel\n6. Juan is young (18-19) and some older bishops may resent being questioned by a youth, even if he's king\n7. His comment about finding honor among Moors was uncomfortable for many\n\nThis is interesting because even on a low roll, the legal argument IS strong and de Cartagena has already made it. What changes is HOW the bishops respond to Juan and whether they grant him the authority/respect he's seeking.\n\nI'll craft a nuanced persuasion roll mechanism that captures the complex political dynamics. The table will reflect how Juan's strategic approach might be received, with outcomes ranging from grudging acceptance to genuine respect. The roll will measure not just legal acknowledgment, but the council's perception of Juan's political acumen and diplomatic skill.\n\nPERSUASION ROLL: Juan's Authority and the Legal Question\n\nI need to evaluate how Juan's careful, logical approach lands with this fractious council.\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nJuan's framing is exceptionally clever—separating legal validity from policy approval allows conservatives to acknowledge Basel's right to exist without endorsing its positions\n\nHe addresses Bishop de Ávila respectfully, promising to discuss his concerns \"at length\"—shows he takes conservative opposition seriously\n\nAsks for clarity on law before action—exactly the prudent approach these bishops should appreciate\n\nHis earlier speech established both crusading zeal (pleasing conservatives) and careful thinking (pleasing moderates)\n\nHe explicitly references being shaped by Pope Martin V—strong credentials with this audience\n\nBy asking for \"this council's opinion\" he grants them collective authority and respect\n\nBishop de Cartagena has already made the legal argument effectively—Juan is building on established ground\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nConservatives are emotionally invested in papal supremacy—logic may not overcome feeling\n\nAdmitting Basel has legal right to exist feels like betraying Pope Eugenius to some\n\nThe room is predominantly conservative and hostile to Basel overall\n\nSome may see Juan's question as a trap or as being too sympathetic to conciliarism\n\nJuan is young (18-19) and some older bishops may resent being questioned, even by their king\n\nHis earlier comment about finding honor among Moors made several uncomfortable\n\nBishop de Ávila and others want emotional validation, not legal parsing\n\nD100 TABLE: Council Response to Juan's Legal Question\n\n1-15: HOSTILE RESISTANCE\nBishop de Ávila feels cornered and reacts defensively. \"Your Majesty, you ask us to legitimize rebellion! The legal question is inseparable from loyalty to the Holy Father!\" Several conservative bishops voice agreement, uncomfortable with where Juan is leading them. The mood turns tense—they see this as Juan being too sympathetic to Basel's position.\n\n16-30: GRUDGING CONCESSION WITH RESENTMENT\nThe conservatives are clearly unhappy but cannot escape de Cartagena's logic. Bishop de Ávila responds stiffly: \"Legally... technically... Basel was called by proper authority. But Your Majesty must understand this changes nothing about their current rebellion.\" The admission comes grudgingly, and several bishops shift uncomfortably. They feel forced into a corner.\n\n31-50: DIVIDED ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe moderates nod at Juan's wisdom in separating the questions. De Cartagena speaks: \"Yes, Your Majesty, Basel has legal right to exist per Frequens.\" But conservatives immediately push back—Bishop de Isorna: \"Legal right to meet, perhaps. Not legal right to defy dissolution.\" The council is clearly split, though Juan's framing has moved the conversation forward.\n\n51-70: RESPECTFUL CONSIDERATION\nArchbishop Gutiérrez nods approvingly at Juan's approach. \"Your Majesty asks the right questions in the right order.\" Even Bishop de Ávila, though unhappy, responds more calmly: \"I concede the council was properly called, Your Majesty. My objection is to their subsequent defiance.\" The conservatives respect Juan's methodical approach even as they prepare their counter-arguments. The mood remains serious but productive.\n\n71-85: STRONG APPROVAL\nThe Archbishop smiles slightly—Juan has impressed him. \"Your Majesty demonstrates the wisdom that comes from genuine faith and careful thought.\" Even conservatives acknowledge the logic: Bishop de Isorna nods reluctantly, \"The legal point is sound, Your Majesty. Basel was properly convened. Our concerns lie elsewhere.\" Juan has earned significant respect for his careful reasoning. The council feels honored that their king thinks so deeply about these matters.\n\n86-100: COMMANDING RESPECT\nA moment of silence follows Juan's question—several bishops exchange glances of genuine respect. Archbishop Gutiérrez addresses the room: \"His Majesty shows us how a Christian king should approach such matters—with both devotion to the Church and clarity of mind.\" Even Bishop de Ávila responds with dignity: \"Your Majesty, I concede the legal point entirely. You are right to establish this foundation before we discuss what Castile should do.\" Juan has elevated the entire discussion and earned the council's deep respect. They see him as a worthy king engaging seriously with crucial questions.\n\nPlease roll 1d100."

This is wisdom.\" He glances around the room. \"The legal foundation must be established before we can discuss what Castile should do.\"\n\nBishop de Ávila takes a breath, visibly composing himself. When he speaks again, his voice is calmer, though still carrying an edge of dissatisfaction. \"Your Majesty, I concede the point. The council was properly called under the decree Frequens. Pope Martin V himself issued the bulls of convocation.\" He pauses, choosing his words carefully. \"My objection—and I believe the objection of many here—is not to Basel's right to meet. It is to their subsequent defiance when Pope Eugenius ordered dissolution.\"\n\nSeveral other bishops murmur agreement. Bishop de Cartagena inclines his head respectfully. \"His Majesty is correct to separate these questions. Yes, Basel has legal right to exist. The question that follows is: Does Pope Eugenius have authority to dissolve what Frequens established? And did Basel have the right to refuse?\"\n\nThe room settles into a more thoughtful atmosphere. Even the conservatives seem to appreciate that you're engaging seriously with the complexity rather than rushing to judgment. The Abbott of Valladolid speaks quietly: \"His Majesty demonstrates that faith and reason need not be enemies. We can acknowledge legal realities while still debating proper obedience.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez looks to you, waiting to see where you will guide this discussion next."

The bishops should respond informatively.\n\nBishop de Cartagena stands, clearly energized by the intellectual exercise. \"Your Majesty, this is precisely where the conflict begins.\" He gestures to one of the younger clergy who quickly produces documents. \"Basel's original mandate, from Pope Martin V's bulls, specified three purposes: reform of the Church 'in head and members,' negotiation with the Hussites, and pursuit of union with the Eastern Church.\"\n\n\"Reform in head and members,\" the Abbott of Valladolid interjects, his weathered voice carrying weight, \"is an old phrase. It means reforming both the leadership—the 'head,' meaning the papacy and curia—and the 'members,' meaning bishops, priests, and religious orders throughout Christendom.\"\n\nBishop de Isorna stands sharply. \"And there is where Basel oversteps! They claim authority to reform the Pope himself. To limit his revenues, restrict his appointments, bind his hands in governing the Church!\" His voice rises with indignation. \"This is not reform—it is rebellion dressed in pious language!\"\n\nDe Cartagena responds calmly: \"The Council of Constance claimed exactly such authority when it deposed three popes and elected Martin V. If Constance had that power, why not Basel?\"\n\n\"Because the schism was an emergency!\" Bishop de Ávila's voice cracks across the chamber. \"Three men claiming to be pope—that required extraordinary measures! But now? We have one legitimate pope, Eugenius IV, properly elected. Basel has no cause to strip his authority!\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez raises his hand, restoring order. He turns to you. \"Your Majesty, the fundamental question is this: What powers does a council possess? There are three positions.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers as he speaks:\n\n\"First, the papalist view—held by Pope Eugenius and many here—that councils are advisory bodies called by the Pope to assist him. They can recommend reforms, but only the Pope can implement them. The Pope stands above councils because he is Christ's Vicar.\"\n\n\"Second, the moderate conciliarist view—that councils have authority in specific extraordinary circumstances: matters of faith, ending schism, and reforming the Church when the Pope himself is the problem. But in normal times, papal supremacy prevails.\"\n\n\"Third, the radical conciliarist view—increasingly common at Basel—that councils represent the whole Church and therefore possess supreme authority over even the Pope in all matters. Some at Basel claim the council is superior to the papacy itself.\"\n\nBishop of Palencia, the younger reform-minded bishop, adds carefully: \"Basel has asserted the second position officially—conciliar authority in matters of reform and heresy. But Your Majesty should know that some voices there lean toward the third position. They speak of councils as the Church's true governing body.\"\n\n\"Heresy,\" Bishop de León mutters darkly.\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez looks at you steadily. \"As for what Basel is actually discussing now, Your Majesty—they debate all three of their mandated issues. They are negotiating with Hussite ambassadors about the Four Articles of Prague. They plan discussions with Byzantine representatives about church union. And they are proposing sweeping reforms that would dramatically reduce papal power over church revenues and appointments.\"\n\nHe pauses significantly. \"They also declared themselves superior to the Pope and immune to dissolution. That is the crisis.\"\n\nThe room waits to see what you will ask next."

          "text": "Juan is asking a very sharp question - what precedents exist from Constance about what powers councils actually have? This is getting to the heart of the legal ambiguity that's tearing the Church apart.\n\nThe reality is that Constance's decrees were intentionally ambiguous or were interpreted differently by different parties. The decree *Haec Sancta* declared councils had authority from Christ and that even popes must obey in matters of faith, schism, and reform - but did this apply only during the schism emergency, or permanently? This was never definitively resolved.\n\nJuan is asking smart questions that should impress the bishops. He's building on the respectful consideration he earned. The bishops should appreciate that he's drilling down to the core legal issues.\n\nSuccess factors:\n- Juan is identifying the exact source of the ambiguity\n- He's asking for concrete precedent, which is the right legal approach\n- He's showing he understands that Constance is the key document\n- This is a logical next step in his methodical questioning\n\nFailure factors:\n- Some conservatives may be uncomfortable with where this is going (it tends to favor conciliarist arguments)\n- The answer is genuinely ambiguous and may frustrate those wanting clarity\n- Some may see Juan as being too sympathetic to Basel by constantly drilling on legal technicalities\n\nBut I don't think I need a roll here - Juan is just asking for information, not making an argument yet. The bishops can explain the ambiguity.\n\nBishop de Cartagena's eyes light up. \"Your Majesty cuts directly to the heart of the matter.\" He turns to the assembled bishops. \"This is precisely the problem. Constance's decrees are subject to conflicting interpretations.\"\n\nHe gestures for the documents again. \"The decree Haec Sancta Synodus, issued in 1415, declared that the council 'has its power directly from Christ' and that 'everyone, of every rank and condition, including the Pope himself, is bound to obey it in matters concerning the faith, the ending of the schism, and the reformation of the Church in head and members.'\"\n\n\"But,\" Bishop de Isorna interrupts forcefully, \"that decree was issued during the schism, when there were three competing popes and the Church was in chaos! It was an emergency measure to resolve an impossible situation, not a permanent revolution in church governance!\"\n\nDe Cartagena continues calmly: \"Pope Martin V never formally approved Haec Sancta. He confirmed the council's other decrees but remained notably silent on this one. Some argue his silence means rejection. Others argue his silence means acceptance—that he couldn't reject the very decree that gave the council authority to elect him as the legitimate pope.\"\n\nThe Abbott of Valladolid speaks quietly: \"I was much younger then, but I remember the debates. Many believed Constance had established a new permanent structure—that councils would serve as a check on papal power, preventing future schisms and corruption. Others believed it was purely emergency governance, to be forgotten once a legitimate pope was restored.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez adds: \"The decree Frequens, requiring regular councils, suggests permanence. But Pope Eugenius now argues that even Frequens was merely to ensure watchfulness during the difficult years following the schism, not to bind all future popes forever.\"\n\nBishop of León stands, his frustration evident. \"Your Majesty, this is why we are in crisis! The powers of councils were never clearly defined because to define them would be to either limit the Pope or to limit the councils. Both sides avoided clarity, and now we pay the price.\"\n\nBishop de Cartagena nods soberly. \"Your Majesty has identified the central problem. There is no clear codification. Constance left fundamental questions unanswered. Does conciliar authority apply only during emergencies, or permanently? Can popes override conciliar decrees, or must they obey? If councils have authority 'in matters of reform,' who decides what qualifies as reform versus normal church governance?\"\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"Basel claims Constance established permanent conciliar supremacy. Pope Eugenius claims Constance was an emergency measure that ended when he was elected. Both cite the same historical events, but interpret them completely differently.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez looks at you with evident respect. \"Your Majesty demonstrates why this dispute cannot be resolved by simple appeal to precedent. The precedent itself is ambiguous. That is what makes this conflict so dangerous—both sides have legitimate arguments.\"\n\nThe room is quiet, the bishops clearly impressed by how you've exposed the fundamental ambiguity at the heart of the crisis.\n\nWhat will you ask next?"

          "text": "Juan is asking about the Four Articles of Prague - the Hussite demands. This is a good question that shows he's taking seriously the substance of what Basel is discussing, not just the procedural questions. Let me check what the project files say about these.\n\nFrom the search results, I found:\n\"**The Four Articles of Prague:**\n1. Freedom of preaching\n2. Communion in both kinds\n3. Poverty of clergy and expropriation of church property\n4. Punishment of mortal sins regardless of rank\"\n\nThese are the Hussite demands. This should create an interesting discussion because:\n- Some demands might seem reasonable to Juan (like punishing sins regardless of rank - he's dealt with corrupt nobles)\n- Some might seem threatening (expropriation of church property)\n- The conservatives will see all of them as heretical\n- The moderates might see some merit in some demands\n\nThis is a good opportunity for realistic medieval debate where the bishops would have very different reactions.\n\nBishop de Cartagena refers to his documents. \"The Hussites presented four demands at Prague, which have become known as the Four Articles. They are the minimum terms the Hussites will accept for any reconciliation with the Church.\"\n\nHe reads carefully: \"First, free preaching of the Word of God. The Hussites demand that priests be allowed to preach without episcopal censorship or restriction. They claim the Gospel should be available to all people in their own language.\"\n\n\"Heresy!\" Bishop de León explodes. \"Unchecked preaching leads directly to error! This is how Hus himself corrupted Bohemia—standing in his pulpit spreading poison without proper authority!\"\n\nDe Cartagena continues: \"Second, communion in both kinds—both bread and wine—for all laypeople, not just priests. Currently, as Your Majesty knows, the laity receives only the bread. The Hussites demand the chalice as well.\"\n\nBishop de Ávila shakes his head vehemently. \"This questions the Church's authority to determine the sacraments! If we concede this, what next? Every heretic will demand changes to sacred rites!\"\n\n\"Third,\" de Cartagena reads on, his voice growing quieter, \"poverty of clergy and expropriation of church property. The Hussites demand that priests and bishops own no temporal possessions, living in apostolic poverty. All church lands and wealth should be seized and redistributed.\"\n\nA shocked silence fills the room. Several bishops exchange alarmed glances. The Abbott of Valladolid speaks grimly: \"This is not reform—this is destruction. They would strip the Church of the very resources needed to carry out its mission. How would monasteries function? How would cathedrals be maintained? How would the poor be fed?\"\n\n\"Finally,\" de Cartagena concludes, \"the fourth article: punishment of mortal sins regardless of rank. They demand that all public mortal sins—especially simony, usury, and clerical unchastity—be punished equally whether committed by bishop or peasant. No one is exempt.\"\n\nBishop de Isorna stands slowly. \"Your Majesty, you see now what Basel negotiates with? The first article undermines church authority over preaching. The second questions our control of the sacraments. The third would destroy the Church as an institution. The fourth...\" he pauses, \"the fourth sounds reasonable in principle, but in practice means secular authorities investigating and punishing clergy. It strips the Church of its independent jurisdiction.\"\n\nBut the Bishop of Palencia speaks up, his young voice uncertain but thoughtful: \"Though... Your Majesty... the fourth article. Is it entirely wrong? Should a bishop who commits simony escape punishment because of his rank? Should a priest who keeps a concubine be exempt from consequences?\"\n\n\"That is for the Church to handle internally!\" Bishop de Ávila snaps. \"Not for heretics to dictate, and certainly not for secular courts to enforce!\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez observes the debate, then turns to you. \"Your Majesty, Basel's negotiations with the Hussites focus on these four articles. The question is whether any compromise is possible. Can the Church concede any of these demands without betraying fundamental doctrine? Or must all four be rejected entirely, even if it means continued war?\"\n\nHe pauses meaningfully. \"Five crusades have failed. The Hussites defeated every army sent against them, including the one Cardinal Cesarini led last year. Basel believes negotiation might succeed where military force has failed. But many—\" he gestures to the conservative bishops, \"—believe negotiating with heretics legitimizes heresy itself.\"\n\nThe room waits to hear your thoughts on these demands."

Agreeing with the conservative Bishop de Ávila on jurisdictional grounds (church handles church matters)\n3. BUT also asserting that clerical corruption MUST be punished hard\n4. Asking de Ávila to clarify that he agrees with the principle of punishing corruption, just not the mechanism\n\nThis is clever - Juan is trying to find common ground between conservatives and reformers. He's saying \"yes, clergy should be above secular judgment, but that means the Church must police itself rigorously.\"\n\nThis should land well with both camps:\n- Conservatives like the affirmation of clerical privilege and sanctity\n- Reformers like the insistence on actual punishment of corruption\n- Juan is showing he understands the nuance\n\nBishop de Ávila is being asked a direct question. He needs to respond carefully. If he says \"yes, I agree corruption should be punished,\" he validates the reform position. If he says \"no, bishops shouldn't be punished,\" he looks like he's defending corruption. Juan has put him in a position where he has to agree with the principle while maintaining the jurisdictional argument.\n\nThis is good political maneuvering by Juan. Let me show how de Ávila responds, likely agreeing but trying to emphasize that such cases are rare or that existing mechanisms work.\n\nBishop de Ávila's stern expression softens slightly. He takes a moment before responding, clearly weighing his words. \"Your Majesty... yes. You understand me correctly.\"\n\nHe straightens, speaking with careful dignity. \"I do not—God forbid—defend corruption among the clergy. When a priest keeps a concubine, when a bishop sells offices, when any man of the cloth betrays his sacred vows, he wounds the Body of Christ itself.\" His voice carries genuine conviction. \"Such men should be punished severely, removed from office, subjected to penance.\"\n\nHe pauses, then continues more firmly: \"My objection is to the instrument. The Hussites demand that secular authorities investigate and punish clergy. This breaks the ancient principle that the Church governs itself. If kings and magistrates can haul bishops before civil courts, try them for sins, strip them of office...\" He shakes his head. \"Today they punish genuine corruption. Tomorrow they punish bishops who oppose the king's policies, calling it 'simony' or inventing other charges.\"\n\nBishop de Cartagena nods thoughtfully. \"Bishop de Ávila makes a fair point about the danger. But Your Majesty also makes a fair point—that clerical privilege requires clerical accountability. If the Church does not police itself rigorously, others will do it for us, and far less carefully.\"\n\nThe Abbott of Valladolid speaks quietly, his aged voice carrying hard-earned wisdom: \"In my seventy-three years, I have seen both sides of this. I have seen corrupt clergy escape punishment because their bishops protected them. And I have seen innocent priests destroyed by false accusations from secular lords who wanted their lands.\" He looks at you. \"Your Majesty is right to insist on the principle. Bishop de Ávila is right to fear the instrument. The question is: Can the Church reform itself before others force reform upon it?\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez observes you with evident respect, clearly noting how deftly you've navigated between the conservative and reform positions. \"Your Majesty asks the questions a Christian king should ask—how to maintain both the Church's sanctity and its integrity.\"\n\nThe bishops wait, curious where you will take this line of thinking next."

Canon law exists, but enforcement depends on individual bishops' will.\" The Abbott nods sadly. Conservative bishops look uncomfortable but don't argue—they know it's true. The council respects your question but feels the weight of institutional failure.\n\n46-65: HONEST RECOGNITION\nThe Abbott of Valladolid sighs deeply. \"Your Majesty, you have identified precisely the problem that drives calls for reform. We have rules but lack consistent enforcement. When a bishop protects his corrupt priests, who corrects him?\" Several bishops nod, including some conservatives. Archbishop Gutiérrez adds: \"This is why Basel's demands resonate even when we oppose their methods.\" Your question has elevated the discussion.\n\n66-80: RESPECTFUL ENGAGEMENT\nArchbishop Gutiérrez responds with evident approval of your insight. \"Your Majesty has identified the central weakness.

We are all men of power and prestige, we have sworn oaths and live to uphold them, but we fail. I fail daily. And I ask for your forgiveness.\n\n\nJust yesterday when I was drafting the campain budget for the coming year, I proposed a military academy to be constructed so we can better learn to fight Islam. Quite an expense and also an enrichment for my own kingdom and my own power. A simple and clever way to use crusade finances to enrich my kingdom and therefore myself.\n\n\nFortunately, your agent the papal legate gently adjusted the spending and indicated that since this academy would permanently empower Castille, the crown should pay for it's construction, the crusade would pay for it's upkeep for as long as the crusade lasted. I had tried in my own sinful way to abuse crusade finances for my own gain. I ask for forgiveness. I thank you lord to have your legate present to prevent me from committing this sin. Even if I tried to in my heart. Sometimes it is so easy to give in to temptation, especially when no one is watching.\n\n\nPlease forgive me my sin.\n\n\nBless this council o Lord.\n\n\nIf I may ask - selfishly - for anything is that you be with us. Be in our presence o Lord so we may act in your glory and in honour of your name.\n\n\nAmen.\n\n\nThe above is an action. Draft a d100 table to see how the council responds to this prompt confession of Juan."

He's showing genuine piety and self-awareness\n\nThis should be a PERSUASION roll because Juan is trying to build legitimacy and favor with the council.\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n- Extraordinary humility from a king - very rare\n- Demonstrates genuine faith and self-examination\n- Makes the abstract discussion concrete with personal example\n- Shows the VALUE of oversight by crediting Capranica\n- Honors the Church's role (through the legate) in preventing sin\n- Creates powerful parallel: \"Even I need oversight, so doesn't the Church?\"\n- His vulnerability and honesty are compelling\n- Medieval culture values public penance and confession\n- He's showing he practices what he preaches about accountability\n- The prayer itself is well-crafted and sincere\n- He asks for God's presence for the COUNCIL, not just himself\n- Shows he sees himself as a sinner like everyone else, not above them\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n- Some might see this as manipulative - \"is he trying to make us look bad by comparison?\"\n- Could be seen as theatrical or performative\n- Some conservative bishops might think it's improper for a king to confess publicly like this\n- A few might think he's being naive - \"everyone skims a little from budgets\"\n- Could make some uncomfortable - they've never confessed their own temptations\n- Some might resent the implicit comparison: \"You have oversight, we don't\"\n- A cynic might see this as clever rhetoric rather than genuine piety\n \nIn the medieval ecclesiastical context, this confession strikes at the heart of spiritual and political dynamics. Juan's approach is masterfully calculated to resonate with churchmen, leveraging deep cultural values of humility, accountability, and public penance. His strategic vulnerability transforms a potential moment of weakness into a powerful demonstration of spiritual leadership.\n\nPERSUASION ROLL: Juan's Public Confession\n\nI need to evaluate how this extraordinary act of public confession and humility lands with the assembled bishops.\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nA king confessing sin publicly before clergy is extraordinarily rare and humble\n\nJuan demonstrates the VALUE of oversight with a concrete personal example\n\nHe credits the papal legate publicly, honoring the Church's corrective role\n\nMakes the abstract discussion tangible: \"Even I tried to misuse funds when no one was watching\"\n\nShows genuine self-examination and awareness of his own temptation\n\nCreates powerful implicit argument: \"If even kings need oversight, doesn't the Church?\"\n\nMedieval Christian culture deeply values public penance and confession\n\nHis vulnerability is compelling and disarming\n\nHe asks for God's presence for the COUNCIL, not just himself\n\nShows he sees himself as a fellow sinner, not above the bishops\n\nThe prayer is sincere and well-crafted\n\nDemonstrates he practices the accountability he's been discussing\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nSome might see this as manipulative theater rather than genuine piety\n\nCould be perceived as making the bishops look bad by comparison\n\nA few conservatives might think it improper for a king to confess so publicly\n\nSome might feel uncomfortable - forced to confront their own unconfessed sins\n\nCould be seen as naive - \"everyone skims budgets a little\"\n\nCynics might view this as clever rhetoric to win an argument\n\nSome might resent the implicit message: \"You bishops need oversight like I did\"\n\nA few might feel this is overly dramatic or performative\n\nD100 TABLE: Council Response to Juan's Public Confession\n\n1-5: CYNICAL RECEPTION\nBishop de Isorna's eyes narrow slightly. After the prayer ends, there's an awkward silence. A few bishops exchange glances that suggest they see this as calculated performance. \"Your Majesty is... pious,\" someone murmurs uncomfortably. The moment falls flat - they think you're being theatrical to score a rhetorical point.\n\n6-15: UNCOMFORTABLE ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe bishops shift uneasily during and after your prayer. When you rise, there's uncertain murmuring. Archbishop Gutiérrez says carefully, \"Your Majesty's... humility is noted.\" But several bishops look discomfited, perhaps feeling judged by comparison or unsure how to respond to such public vulnerability from their king. The mood is awkward.\n\n16-30: RESPECTFUL BUT RESERVED\nAfter a moment of silence, several bishops murmur \"Amen.\" Archbishop Gutiérrez nods gravely. \"Your Majesty demonstrates commendable self-examination.\" The bishops respect your piety but seem uncertain about the theatrical nature of the confession. They appreciate the sentiment but aren't deeply moved. The discussion can continue, but the moment hasn't transformed the room.\n\n31-50: GENUINE APPRECIATION\nWhen you finish, several bishops cross themselves and say \"Amen\" with feeling. Bishop de Cartagena looks at you with evident respect. \"Your Majesty shows true humility.\" The Abbott of Valladolid nods slowly, clearly moved. Even some conservatives seem touched by your vulnerability. Your point about oversight is well-made through personal example. The mood has softened noticeably.\n\n51-70: MOVED RESPONSE\nA profound silence follows your prayer. When you rise, Bishop de Cartagena has tears in his eyes. \"Your Majesty... to confess such temptation publicly...\" The Abbott stands, his aged voice thick: \"I have known seven popes and a dozen kings. I have never witnessed such humility.\" Several bishops look genuinely affected. Archbishop Gutiérrez: \"This is what Christian kingship looks like.\" Your demonstration of accountability has deeply impressed them.\n\n71-85: POWERFUL IMPACT\nAs you pray, several bishops bow their heads, and you hear quiet weeping from at least one. When you finish, the Bishop of Palencia stands suddenly: \"Forgive me, Your Majesty, brothers - I too have been tempted. I accepted a 'gift' for an appointment last year and told myself it was merely gratitude...\" His voice breaks. Your confession has opened a floodgate. Other bishops begin acknowledging their own struggles. Archbishop Gutiérrez's eyes shine with unshed tears. The whole dynamic of the council has shifted.\n\n86-95: TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENT\nDuring your prayer, Bishop de Ávila - the stern conservative - suddenly rises and kneels beside you. \"And I, Lord, have protected priests I knew were unworthy because they came from powerful families...\" His voice cracks. When you finish, half the bishops are on their knees, some openly weeping. The Abbott is praying quietly. Archbishop Gutiérrez: \"Your Majesty has shown us what reform truly means - beginning with ourselves.\" The council has become a moment of genuine spiritual reckoning.\n\n96-100: PROFOUND TRANSFORMATION\nAs you kneel and begin confessing, Archbishop Gutiérrez slowly rises from his chair and kneels beside you. Then Bishop de Cartagena. Then, one by one, even the stern conservatives - de Ávila, de Isorna, the Bishop of León. By the time you say \"Amen,\" every man in the chamber is on his knees. The Abbott is openly weeping. Bishop de Isorna's voice breaks: \"Forgive me, Lord, for defending the indefensible out of pride...\" This has become not a political council but a moment of collective confession and genuine spiritual transformation. When they finally rise, these men look at you - and at each other - with new eyes.\n\nPlease roll 1d100."

Acknowledgment from key figures like de Cartagena and the Abbott\n4. Even some softening from conservatives\n5. The implicit argument about oversight has landed\n6. The mood is now more collaborative and less defensive\n7. They're ready to continue the discussion with newfound respect\n\nThis should be about 4-6 paragraphs since it's an important moment but not a full transformative scene.\n\nAs you kneel and speak your prayer aloud, a profound stillness settles over the chamber. Several bishops bow their heads. When you reach the part about your own near-transgression with the crusade budget, you hear sharp intakes of breath—the candor of it clearly unexpected.\n\nWhen you say \"Amen,\" the response comes from multiple voices around the room: \"Amen.\" Several bishops cross themselves with visible feeling.\n\nBishop de Cartagena looks at you with unmistakable respect, his scholarly composure touched by genuine emotion. \"Your Majesty...\" He pauses, seeming to struggle for words. \"To confess such temptation publicly, before your bishops... this shows true humility. This is what separates a Christian king from a mere ruler.\"\n\nThe Abbott of Valladolid nods slowly, his aged eyes glistening. \"In all my years, I have rarely witnessed such...\" He stops, overcome for a moment. \"Your Majesty demonstrates precisely what we have been discussing. Even with the best intentions, even with genuine faith, we are all susceptible to temptation. You tried to use crusade funds improperly—not from malice, but because it seemed reasonable, beneficial even. And had Cardinal Capranica not been there to correct you...\"\n\n\"We all need that correction,\" Bishop de Cartagena finishes quietly. \"King and bishop alike.\"\n\nEven Bishop de Ávila seems affected, his stern expression softened. He speaks more gently than before: \"Your Majesty's example shames me. Perhaps... perhaps I have been too quick to defend institutional prerogatives and too slow to acknowledge when those institutions fail to correct us as they should.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez looks at you with profound respect. \"Your Majesty has made the argument for oversight more powerfully than any theological treatise could. Not through abstract reasoning, but through honest confession of your own struggle.\" He glances around at his fellow bishops. \"If our king, blessed by the Pope himself, leading a holy crusade, still needed the Church's corrective hand... how much more do we all need such accountability?\"\n\nThe atmosphere in the chamber has fundamentally shifted. The defensiveness has largely evaporated. The bishops look at you—and the question of church reform—with new eyes.\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez waits a respectful moment, then speaks: \"Your Majesty, shall we continue our discussion? I believe your question and your example have illuminated the path forward.\""

          "text": "Juan is now turning to the third article of Prague - the demand for poverty of clergy and expropriation of church property. This is indeed the most radical and threatening of the four articles from the bishops' perspective, because it would strip them of their temporal power and wealth.\n\nI need to have the bishops explain this article accurately and respond to Juan's question about whether the Hussites are serious. The answer is yes - they are deadly serious. The Hussite movement, particularly the more radical Taborite faction, genuinely believes that clergy should live in apostolic poverty and that church wealth corrupts the spiritual mission.\n\nThe bishops will need to explain:\n1. Yes, the Hussites are completely serious about this\n2. The historical and theological basis for this demand (apostolic poverty, Francis of Assisi, criticism of wealthy prelates)\n3. Why this is so threatening to the institutional Church\n4. The practical impossibility of implementing it\n5. The different responses from various bishops\n\nThis should be relatively straightforward narration - no roll needed unless Juan takes a specific action trying to persuade the council of something. He's just asking for information and expressing his reaction.\n\nBishop de Cartagena nods gravely. \"Your Majesty, they are entirely serious. This is perhaps the most radical of their four demands, and the one that terrifies the institutional Church most deeply.\"\n\nHe refers to his documents. \"The Hussites—particularly the more radical Taborite faction—demand that all clergy, from parish priests to bishops to the Pope himself, renounce temporal possessions entirely. They should own no land, accept no rents, hold no lordships. They should live by voluntary donations and the labor of their own hands, as the Apostles did.\"\n\nThe Abbott of Valladolid speaks, his voice heavy. \"They point to Scripture, Your Majesty. Christ told the rich young man to sell all he had and give to the poor. Christ sent his disciples out with nothing but the clothes on their backs. The early Church held all things in common. The Hussites argue that somewhere in the centuries since, the Church abandoned this apostolic poverty and became corrupted by wealth.\"\n\nBishop de Isorna's voice carries barely controlled anger. \"They would destroy everything! This monastery—\" he gestures around them, \"—built over centuries, maintaining libraries, feeding the poor, educating clergy. Gone. The Cathedral of Toledo with its sacred art and relics. Gone. Every hospital the Church operates, every school, every charitable foundation. All of it depends on church property and revenues!\"\n\nBishop de Ávila adds bitterly: \"And they speak of 'expropriation'—a gentle word for theft. They mean to seize church lands and redistribute them. To whom? The nobles? The commons? This is not reform—it is revolution disguised as piety.\"\n\nBut Bishop de Cartagena raises a hand. \"Your Majesty should understand the theological argument they make, even if we reject it. They point to figures like Saint Francis of Assisi, who embraced radical poverty and founded an order dedicated to it. The Franciscans—\" he nods to one of the friars present, \"—took vows of poverty and became one of our most vital orders. The Hussites ask: If poverty was holy for Francis, why not for all clergy?\"\n\nThe Franciscan friar speaks up, his voice quiet but firm. \"But Your Majesty, the Franciscan order owns nothing as individuals. The order itself holds property in common to support our mission. There is a difference between personal poverty—which we embrace—and institutional poverty, which would make our work impossible.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez addresses you directly. \"Your Majesty, the Hussites look at bishops who live like princes, who command armies, who compete with nobles for wealth and power, and they say: 'This is not what Christ intended.' And in their hearts... they are not entirely wrong to question whether such wealth serves the Gospel.\"\n\nHe pauses significantly. \"But their solution—stripping the Church of all temporal foundation—would leave us powerless to resist secular lords, unable to maintain institutions of learning and charity, dependent entirely on the whims of those who give or withhold support.\"\n\nBishop of Palencia, the younger reform-minded bishop, speaks hesitantly: \"Though... Your Majesty... some of the wealth is excessive. When a bishop maintains a court more lavish than minor nobles, when he concerns himself more with rents than souls...\" He trails off under Bishop de Isorna's glare.\n\nThe Abbott speaks again: \"The Hussites are serious, Your Majesty. In the territories they control, they have already seized church property. Monasteries abandoned, bishops in exile, priests living as peasants. Whether this represents return to apostolic purity or destruction of Christian civilization depends on whom you ask.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez looks at you steadily. \"So yes, Your Majesty—they are deadly serious. And from their perspective, after seeing corrupt bishops selling offices and living in luxury while peasants starve, their demand makes a certain terrible sense. From our perspective, it would end the Church as an effective institution.\"\n\nThe bishops wait to hear your response to this most radical demand."

I see scriptoriums producing valuable books. I see learned men upholding just laws. None of this is possible without funding. While I think we may all be sympethatic to the fact that we should all do more in our ppower to help those less fortunate, I almost believe that the seizing of all this church property equals the sin they accuse the church of!

The question of institutional property (which enables the Church's mission)\n\nAnd then he asks the crucial practical question: what are the Hussites actually DOING with seized church property? Are they living up to their ideals or just enriching themselves?\n\nThis is a very smart question that will resonate with the bishops. It moves from abstract theology to practical reality. The bishops would know something about what's happening in Hussite-controlled territories.\n\nJuan continues to show wisdom and is building on the goodwill from his earlier confession. This should maintain or even build on his standing with the council.\n\nBishop de Cartagena straightens, clearly energized by your observation. \"Your Majesty has identified precisely the weakness in the Hussite position!\" He looks around at his fellow bishops. \"The accusation of hypocrisy—claiming poverty while seizing wealth—is not unfounded.\"\n\nThe Abbott of Valladolid nods slowly. \"Reports from Bohemia are... complicated, Your Majesty. The more moderate Hussites, the Utraquists, have indeed distributed some seized property to the poor and to communities. But much has gone to Hussite nobles who supported the rebellion. Land that once belonged to monasteries now enriches the very lords who drove out the monks.\"\n\nBishop de Isorna's voice carries bitter satisfaction. \"They speak of apostolic poverty while Prague's Hussite leaders live in comfort in homes seized from Catholic bishops! They burned monasteries—not to give the land to peasants, but to reward their military commanders!\"\n\nBut Bishop de Cartagena raises a cautioning hand. \"Though to be fair, Your Majesty, the radical Taborites—the most extreme faction—have attempted to live their principles. They established communes where property is held in common, where none may own anything privately. It is... chaotic, and violent toward those who resist, but they are at least sincere in their poverty.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez adds thoughtfully: \"Your Majesty's point about the Church's institutions is well-taken. The scriptorium here in Toledo has produced copies of Scripture, works of theology, histories. The hospital in Burgos treats hundreds of sick poor each year. The Cathedral schools educate clergy who serve in remote villages. All of this requires resources—parchment, ink, buildings, food for the monks and students.\"\n\nHe gestures around the chamber. \"This very room, where we deliberate on matters of faith—built with church wealth. The books we consult—copied in monasteries supported by church lands. When the Hussites say 'abolish church property,' they mean abolish all of this.\"\n\nBishop of Palencia speaks carefully: \"Though Your Majesty, we must also acknowledge—some church wealth is excessive. When a bishop spends more on his personal chapel than on feeding the poor of his diocese... that is the sin you name. The Hussites see that sin and wrongly conclude that all church property is sinful.\"\n\nThe Franciscan friar adds: \"Saint Francis embraced poverty precisely so he could serve the poor with clean hands, free from the corruption wealth brings. But even he did not demand the Church as a whole abandon its mission of maintaining learning and charity. There is wisdom in distinguishing personal poverty from institutional resources dedicated to good works.\"\n\nBishop de Ávila speaks, his voice thoughtful rather than angry now: \"Your Majesty sees clearly. The sin is not in the Church owning property to fulfill its mission. The sin is in individual clergy using church resources for personal luxury while ignoring suffering around them. The Hussite solution—destroying the institutional foundation—throws away the good with the bad.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez looks at you with evident approval. \"Your Majesty demonstrates precisely the kind of discernment needed in these matters. Yes, we must address clerical excess and ensure church wealth serves Christian purposes. No, we should not destroy the Church's ability to carry out its sacred mission. The Hussites conflate the two, and Basel must not make the same error.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds significantly: \"And Your Majesty is right to question whether Hussite nobles seizing monastery lands truly serve apostolic poverty, or merely substitute new masters for old.\"\n\nThe bishops look at you with respect, clearly impressed by how you've cut through the rhetorical claims to practical reality.\n\n\"Shall we examine the remaining articles, Your Majesty?\" the Archbishop asks. \"Free preaching, and communion in both kinds?\""

          "text": "Juan is asking about communion in both kinds. Let me recall what I know from the project files about this issue.\n\nFrom the search results, the second article is: \"communion in both kinds—both bread and wine—for all laypeople, not just priests. Currently, as Your Majesty knows, the laity receives only the bread. The Hussites demand the chalice as well.\"\n\nBishop de Ávila's reaction was: \"This questions the Church's authority to determine the sacraments! If we concede this, what next? Every heretic will demand changes to sacred rites!\"\n\nThis is a significant theological issue in medieval Christianity. The practice was that only priests received both the bread and wine during communion, while lay people only received the bread. The theological justification was related to concerns about spilling the consecrated wine, clerical privilege, and church authority over the sacraments.\n\nThe Hussites saw this as a fundamental issue - Jan Hus had preached about it. The chalice became a symbol of the Hussite movement. They believed Scripture commanded communion in both kinds for all believers, pointing to Christ's words at the Last Supper.\n\nLet me have the bishops explain this carefully, starting with what the current practice is, why it exists, what the Hussites demand, and why it's controversial.\n\nBishop de Cartagena stands, clearly in his element explaining theological matters. \"Your Majesty, this concerns the sacrament of the Eucharist—the most sacred of our sacraments. Currently, when the laity receives communion, they receive only the consecrated bread, the Body of Christ. The priest alone drinks from the chalice containing the consecrated wine, the Blood of Christ.\"\n\nThe Archbishop adds: \"This has been the practice for centuries throughout Western Christendom, though it was not always so. In the early Church, both forms were given to all believers.\"\n\nBishop de Isorna interjects sharply: \"The practice changed for good reason! The precious Blood of Christ risked being spilled by careless laypeople. Wine spoils in warm weather. The logistics of giving wine to hundreds or thousands of people at major feasts became impossible. And theologically, Christ is fully present in either form—bread or wine. To receive the bread is to receive Christ completely.\"\n\nBishop de Cartagena continues: \"The Hussites reject this reasoning. They point to Scripture—Christ's own words at the Last Supper: 'Drink from it, all of you.' They argue that Christ commanded all his followers to receive both bread and wine, not just priests. To deny the chalice to laypeople, they claim, is to disobey Christ's explicit instruction.\"\n\nThe Abbott of Valladolid speaks thoughtfully: \"The chalice has become the symbol of the Hussite movement, Your Majesty. Their banners show a communion cup. They call themselves 'Utraquists'—from the Latin sub utraque specie, meaning 'in both kinds.' For them, this is not merely about ritual practice. It represents the principle that laypeople should have the same access to God's grace as clergy.\"\n\nBishop de Ávila's voice carries warning: \"And there is the danger, Your Majesty. If we concede that the Church was wrong to withhold the chalice, what else might we be wrong about? If laypeople can demand changes to how sacraments are administered based on their own interpretation of Scripture, where does it end? Every heretic with a Bible will claim the Church has corrupted the faith!\"\n\nThe Bishop of Palencia speaks more moderately: \"Though, brothers, we must acknowledge—the theological argument is not entirely without merit. The Eastern Church—in full communion with Rome until the schism—still gives both forms to the laity. They have not abandoned this practice, and they are not heretics.\"\n\nBishop de Isorna snaps back: \"The Greeks have many peculiar practices! That does not mean we should imitate them!\"\n\nBishop de Cartagena raises a hand for calm. \"Your Majesty, the controversy has multiple layers. First, the theological question: Is communion in both kinds necessary for salvation, or merely fitting? The Church teaches it is not necessary—Christ is fully present in the bread alone. The Hussites claim it is necessary because Christ commanded it.\"\n\nHe continues: \"Second, the question of authority: Who decides how sacraments are administered? The Church, guided by centuries of tradition and practical wisdom? Or individual believers interpreting Scripture for themselves?\"\n\nThe Archbishop adds gravely: \"And third, Your Majesty, the symbolic dimension. To grant the Hussites this demand would be seen as the Church admitting error. After fighting five crusades insisting they were wrong, after burning Jan Hus himself for teaching these doctrines, to suddenly concede that they were right all along...\" He shakes his head. \"The damage to church authority would be immense.\"\n\nThe Franciscan friar speaks quietly: \"Yet Basel is seriously considering this concession, Your Majesty. Not because the theology has changed, but because five military defeats have demonstrated we cannot force the Hussites to abandon this practice. The question before Basel is whether preserving church unity is worth allowing regional variation in practice.\"\n\nBishop de León responds hotly: \"Regional variation? This is heresy! If we allow Bohemia to give the chalice, every kingdom will demand exceptions to church law! Today the chalice, tomorrow married priests, the day after—who knows what corruption!\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez looks at you. \"Your Majesty can see why this is controversial. The practice itself—giving wine to laypeople—seems minor. But it touches on fundamental questions: Can the Church change long-standing practices? Can Scripture override tradition? What happens to church authority if we admit we were wrong about something we fought wars to defend?\"\n\nThe chamber waits to hear your thoughts on this delicate matter."

          "text": "The Hussite position is actually more complex than Juan's question suggests. They don't necessarily believe you don't receive Christ's blessing without the wine - that would be a fairly extreme position. Rather, their argument is:\n\n1. Christ commanded \"drink from it, all of you\" - so withholding the chalice is disobedience to Christ's explicit command\n2. The practice symbolizes clerical superiority and separation from laity\n3. Both forms together represent the fullness of the sacrament as Christ instituted it\n4. Even if Christ is \"fully present\" in either form (which some moderate Hussites might accept), that doesn't excuse disobeying his command\n\nThe Catholic position is:\n1. Christ is fully present in either form (doctrine of concomitance)\n2. Therefore receiving the bread = receiving full communion with Christ\n3. The chalice was withheld for practical reasons (spilling, logistics, etc.)\n4. The Church has authority to determine how sacraments are administered\n\nJuan's question cuts to the heart of it - if receiving only the bread still gives you Christ's full blessing, what's the Hussite complaint about? The bishops would need to explain that it's not primarily about whether you receive Christ, but about:\n- Obedience to Christ's command\n- The symbolic separation between clergy and laity\n- Who has authority to change sacramental practices\n- Whether the Church can withhold something Christ commanded\n\nThis is a very good question and the bishops would need to give a nuanced answer.\n\nBishop de Cartagena leans forward, clearly appreciating the precision of your question. \"Your Majesty asks the crucial theological point. The answer is... complicated, and it divides even the Hussites themselves.\"\n\nHe gathers his thoughts. \"The more radical Hussites—the Taborites—do believe something close to what Your Majesty suggests. They claim that without receiving both forms, the sacrament is incomplete, invalid even. That only by receiving both bread and wine do you truly commune with Christ as He commanded.\"\n\n\"But,\" the Abbott interjects, \"the moderate Hussites—the Utraquists who dominate Prague—are more nuanced. They don't necessarily deny that Christ is present in the bread alone. Their argument is different: Christ commanded 'drink from it, all of you.' Whether or not you receive His full blessing through bread alone, you are disobeying Christ's explicit instruction by not drinking the wine. The sin is in the disobedience, not in the lack of blessing.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez adds: \"This is actually clever on their part, Your Majesty. The Church teaches the doctrine of concomitance—that Christ is fully present, body and blood, soul and divinity, in either the consecrated bread or the consecrated wine. You don't need both to receive Him completely.\"\n\nBishop de Isorna nods vigorously. \"Exactly! Which is why their demand is nonsensical! If Christ is fully present in the bread, what does it matter if laypeople don't receive the wine?\"\n\nBut Bishop de Cartagena raises a finger. \"And here the Hussites make their counter-argument: 'If it doesn't matter, why do you priests insist on receiving both forms? Why do you drink from the chalice at every Mass if the bread alone is sufficient?' They accuse us of hypocrisy—claiming the bread is sufficient for the laity while we ourselves always receive both.\"\n\nThe Bishop of Palencia speaks carefully: \"They also argue it creates a visible separation between clergy and laity. The priest drinks from the chalice, elevated above the people. The laity receive only bread, as if they are lesser Christians. Even if theologically both forms aren't necessary, the symbolism matters. It reinforces that priests have special access to Christ that common people lack.\"\n\nBishop de Ávila responds hotly: \"Priests do have special access! We are ordained! We stand in persona Christi at the altar! Of course there is a distinction between clergy and laity!\"\n\nThe Abbott speaks quietly: \"But Your Majesty, the Hussites would say: Christ broke bread and shared wine with His disciples—simple fishermen, tax collectors, ordinary men. He didn't create a separate priestly class with exclusive privileges. When we withhold the chalice, we make a distinction Christ Himself did not make at the Last Supper.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez looks at you steadily. \"So to answer Your Majesty's question directly: Most Hussites do not claim you receive no blessing from bread alone. Rather, they claim you are disobeying Christ's command by not receiving both forms as He instituted them. And they claim the practice reveals the Church's corruption—placing tradition and practical convenience above Christ's explicit words.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"The difficulty for us is that their scriptural argument is... not easily dismissed. Christ did say 'drink from it, all of you.' We justify withholding the chalice through practical concerns and theological reasoning about concomitance. But we cannot deny that the early Church—closer to Christ's time—gave both forms to everyone.\"\n\nBishop de Isorna interjects: \"Practices evolve! The Church has wisdom accumulated over centuries! We don't do everything exactly as the Apostles did!\"\n\n\"True,\" de Cartagena concedes, \"but the Hussites ask: Who gave the Church authority to override Christ's explicit command? And that, Your Majesty, is why this article is so dangerous. It questions whether church tradition can supersede Scripture—a question that strikes at the heart of church authority.\"\n\nThe bishops wait to see how you will weigh these arguments."

He's established credibility.\n\nThis needs a roll to see how the council responds.\n\nA profound silence falls over the chamber. Several bishops exchange glances. The weight of your words—particularly \"are we not all equal before God?\"—hangs in the air.\n\nBishop de Cartagena is the first to speak, his voice carrying both surprise and respect. \"Your Majesty... for one who claims not to be learned, you have identified the theological heart of the matter with remarkable clarity.\"\n\nThe Abbott of Valladolid nods slowly, his aged eyes thoughtful. \"The five crusades. His Majesty is right—the damage to authority has already occurred. We can pretend otherwise, but the world knows the Church sent five armies and all five failed. To now insist we were entirely right about everything...\" He trails off meaningfully.\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez studies you with an expression that mingles respect and something like concern—as if he's seeing depths in you he hadn't fully anticipated. \"Your Majesty distinguishes between capitulating to violence and acknowledging merit on theological grounds. This is... a sophisticated position.\"\n\nBishop de Ávila shifts uncomfortably but speaks without his earlier heat: \"Your Majesty's point about equality before God... it is true, of course. In Heaven, there is neither clergy nor laity, only saved souls. But in this world, the Church must maintain order, structure...\"\n\n\"But does structure require withholding the chalice?\" Bishop de Palencia asks quietly, clearly emboldened by your words. \"If Christ gave both forms to all His disciples, if the early Church followed this practice, if Scripture supports it, and if—as His Majesty notes—we cannot argue it is wrong...\" He looks around nervously. \"Perhaps this is one battle not worth fighting?\"\n\nBishop de Isorna looks deeply troubled. \"Your Majesty, I fear where this reasoning leads. If we admit error on the chalice, every heretic will demand we reconsider every doctrine they dislike. Today the cup, tomorrow—\"\n\n\"Tomorrow we consider each question on its merits, as His Majesty suggests,\" Bishop de Cartagena interrupts gently. \"Rather than defending everything inflexibly out of fear. Is that not also faith? To trust that truth will prevail if examined honestly?\"\n\nThe Franciscan friar speaks quietly: \"Saint Francis taught that humility before God matters more than pride in our own positions. If we were wrong about the chalice—and I do not say we were, but if—would it not be more Christian to admit it than to defend error simply because we've defended it for centuries?\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez looks at you, his expression complex. \"Your Majesty has posed questions that should make us all uncomfortable. Uncomfortable in a productive way.\" He glances around at the bishops. \"His Majesty asks: How is sharing the wine among the faithful wrong? Can any of us answer that question from Scripture?\"\n\nA heavy silence. No one offers an immediate response.\n\nFinally, Bishop de Isorna speaks, his voice subdued: \"We cannot argue it is against Scripture. Our arguments are practical—spillage, spoilage, logistics. And theological—concomitance, that Christ is fully present in the bread. But Your Majesty is right. Christ's own words were 'drink from it, all of you.'\"\n\nThe mood in the chamber has shifted dramatically. Your words have opened a space for reconsideration that wasn't there moments before.\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez speaks carefully: \"Your Majesty, you have given this council much to consider. The question before us is whether Castile should support Basel's negotiations with the Hussites on this point, or insist on absolute rejection of their demands.\"\n\nHe pauses significantly. \"Based on our discussion, what is Your Majesty's inclination?\""

Not the Church surrendering to heretics.\"\n\nBut Bishop de Isorna stands abruptly, his face troubled. \"Your Majesty, I understand your reasoning, but the perception—after five crusades, after burning Jan Hus for teaching this very doctrine, we now grant what he demanded? The world will see weakness, not wisdom!\"\n\nBishop de León adds forcefully: \"And what of Your Majesty's own crusade? You vowed to be the Church's sword against heresy! If Castile supports granting Hussite demands—even framed as theological reconsideration—how does that square with your crusading vows?\"\n\nThe Bishop of Palencia responds before you can: \"His Majesty also vowed to serve the Church with wisdom, not merely violence. If the Church determines that a practice should be restored on theological grounds, supporting that decision strengthens papal authority, not weakens it.\"\n\nBishop de Ávila speaks, clearly wrestling with conflicting feelings. \"Your Majesty's logic is sound. The practice itself is not heretical. Christ did command it. The early Church practiced it. We cannot argue Scripture forbids sharing the chalice...\" He pauses, struggling. \"But to grant this now, after so much blood spilled insisting we were right...\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" the Franciscan friar says quietly, \"that is precisely why we should grant it now. To show that the Church serves truth, not pride. That we can admit when practical considerations led us away from Christ's explicit words.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez raises his hand, his voice carrying authority. \"Your Majesty has posed a clear question: Does this council believe that restoring communion in both kinds—decided by the Council of Basel on theological grounds—would help restore papal authority over Bohemia?\"\n\nHe looks around the chamber. \"This is not a small question. His Majesty asks us to support what amounts to conceding a major Hussite demand, though framed as church reform rather than capitulation.\"\n\nThe bishops exchange uncomfortable glances.

We acknowledge this.\"\n\n\"Second: The Hussite demand for seizure of church property is rejected entirely. The Church requires material resources to fulfill its mission. The sin is in misuse of wealth, not in possessing it.\"\n\n\"Third: On communion in both kinds—we believe this practice could be restored on theological grounds through proper church council deliberation. Not as capitulation to rebels, but as the Church reconsidering its practice in light of Scripture and tradition. If Basel determines this restoration would help bring Bohemia back into communion with Rome, Castile would support this decision.\"\n\n\"Fourth: His Majesty commits that if Basel's negotiations fail, if Bohemia remains in heresy, Castile will be the Church's sword against them.\"\n\nHe looks around the chamber. \"Is this an accurate summary of our position?\"\n\nThe bishops exchange glances. One by one, they nod—some enthusiastically like de Cartagena and the Bishop of Palencia, others more reluctantly like de Isorna and de León, but all in agreement.\n\n\"Then,\" Archbishop Gutiérrez says, turning to you, \"this council has reached its conclusions.

But if every village priest interprets Scripture for himself and preaches without supervision...\"\n\nBishop de León adds forcefully: \"And Scripture in the common tongue! Your Majesty, most people are illiterate peasants. They lack education, lack context, lack understanding of theology. If they read the Bible themselves without proper guidance, they will misinterpret it, draw wrong conclusions, fall into error!\"\n\nBut Bishop de Cartagena raises a hand. \"Though we must acknowledge, brothers, that the Hussites have a point about language. Christ preached to common fishermen in Aramaic—their language. The Apostles spread the Gospel in Greek, the common tongue of the Eastern Mediterranean. Saint Jerome translated the Bible into Latin precisely because that was the common language of his time. Now Latin is understood only by the educated. Is it not reasonable that people hear God's word in their own tongue?\"\n\nThe Bishop of Palencia adds tentatively: \"And many of our own priests preach in Castilian, not Latin, during their homilies. We don't insist every word spoken in church be in Latin. The Hussites ask for this practice to be formally permitted, not invented.\"\n\nBishop de Ávila responds sharply: \"But there's a difference between a bishop-supervised priest giving a homily in the vernacular, explaining church teaching, and unchecked preaching where any priest can say whatever enters his head! The first serves orthodoxy. The second invites chaos!\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez addresses you directly. \"Your Majesty, the controversy has two parts. First, should priests need episcopal permission to preach, or should preaching be a free right of ordained clergy? Second, should Scripture and preaching be available in local languages, or should Latin remain the Church's sole language?\"\n\nThe Franciscan friar speaks: \"The mendicant orders—Franciscans, Dominicans—were founded precisely to preach to common people in their own languages. This is not new or heretical. But we preach under authority, with training, examined for orthodoxy. The Hussites seem to want preaching without any oversight.\"\n\nBishop de Isorna stands again, his voice intense: \"Your Majesty, imagine this in Castile. Every village priest deciding for himself what to preach. Some teach one doctrine, some another. Peasants confused, led astray, unable to distinguish truth from error. This is how heresy spreads—not through learned debate, but through unchecked words to ignorant crowds!\"\n\nBut Bishop de Cartagena counters: \"Yet if we trust priests to celebrate Mass, to hear confessions, to guide souls—do we not trust them to preach? If a priest is so unreliable we cannot trust his preaching, should he be a priest at all?\"\n\nThe Abbott adds gravely: \"The deeper issue, Your Majesty, is authority. The Hussites believe individual priests, guided by Scripture, can teach without hierarchical approval. We believe the Church's teaching authority flows through bishops from the Pope, ensuring consistency and orthodoxy. If every priest is his own authority, interpreting Scripture independently...\" He shakes his head. \"The Church fragments into a thousand pieces.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez looks at you steadily. \"Your Majesty, what are your thoughts on this article? Should preaching require episcopal oversight? Should Scripture be available in Castilian, or remain in Latin?\""

I have had many discourse and good honest godly discussions in Castillian. What use is a sermon in Latin if the simple peasant cannot understand it?\n\n\nI do understand that there should be structure to what is preached. If one parish uses one interpretation and the next another, that leads to confusion. Bring the Gospel to the people but with the structure the church provides.\n\n\nAgain, I feel like these Hussites dont like the church for the power it wields. It is the church responsibility to wield this power responsibly, but we cannot have different interpretations. We should discuss any differing viewpoints on their theological merits and come up with the one blessed interpretation we all shall use.\n\n\nAgain, I am but a follower of christ, not a theologian.

          "text": "This should resonate well with the bishops, though some conservatives will still be nervous about the implications. Juan's framework of \"bring the Gospel to the people but with church structure\" is actually quite sophisticated and gives them a way to support vernacular preaching without endorsing Hussite-style free-for-all.\n\nThe bishops should respond positively to this, though with varying degrees of enthusiasm. This doesn't need a roll - it's a continuation of the discussion where Juan is laying out his position and asking for their input. The previous roll's effects (GENUINE APPRECIATION) are still in play - they respect him and are taking his arguments seriously.\n\nI should show:\n1. Immediate positive reaction to his confession about Latin\n2. Several bishops agreeing with vernacular preaching with oversight\n3. Some remaining concerns about control/consistency\n4. General movement toward a moderate position\n5. Recognition of Juan's wisdom in finding middle ground\n\nThis is the last article, so after this discussion they should be ready to finalize Castile's position and decide on sending delegates to Basel.\n\nSeveral bishops actually smile at your confession about Latin. The Abbott of Valladolid chuckles softly. \"Your Majesty, you are in good company. Most kings struggle with Latin, and many clergy as well, if we're honest.\"\n\nBishop de Cartagena speaks with evident approval: \"Your Majesty has again found the wise middle path. Yes to preaching in the language people understand. Yes to church structure ensuring consistent teaching. This is exactly right.\"\n\nThe Bishop of Palencia nods enthusiastically. \"If His Majesty himself—blessed by the Pope, leading a crusade—admits his Latin is imperfect, how can we expect peasants to understand theological sermons in a foreign tongue? Christ came to save all people, not just the educated!\"\n\nEven Bishop de Isorna seems less resistant now. \"Your Majesty's framework is acceptable. Preaching in Castilian, but with episcopal oversight. Bishops approve what is taught, ensure consistency, correct errors. The content remains under church authority even if the language changes.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez stands, speaking with conviction: \"His Majesty identifies the real issue—the Hussites reject church authority over doctrine, not merely Latin as a language. If Basel permits vernacular preaching but maintains that bishops have authority to supervise and ensure orthodox teaching, this addresses the legitimate concern—people understanding God's word—without surrendering to chaos.\"\n\nThe Franciscan friar adds: \"This is precisely how the mendicant orders operate, Your Majesty. We preach in the people's language, but we are trained, examined, and supervised. Your framework would extend this model more broadly while maintaining accountability.\"\n\nBishop de Ávila speaks thoughtfully: \"And regarding Scripture in the vernacular... if properly translated, with appropriate commentary to prevent misinterpretation, supervised by bishops...\" He pauses, clearly wrestling with the idea. \"Perhaps this could serve the faith rather than undermine it. Though it would require careful control.\"\n\nBishop de León still looks troubled. \"But Your Majesty, the risk remains. Once Scripture is in every language, once every priest preaches freely, even with supposed oversight—practically speaking, how do bishops monitor every village sermon? Errors will spread before they can be corrected!\"\n\nThe Abbott responds: \"They spread now, brother, but in whispers and confusion. Better to bring teaching into the open, in language people understand, where errors can be identified and addressed. Hidden ignorance is more dangerous than visible teaching, even imperfect teaching.\"\n\nBishop de Cartagena addresses you directly: \"Your Majesty, based on your guidance, I believe this council could support the following position: Preaching in vernacular languages should be permitted and even encouraged, to bring God's word to all people. However, such preaching must remain under episcopal supervision to ensure doctrinal consistency. Priests should be properly trained and their teaching subject to review.\"\n\nHe continues: \"Similarly, Scripture could be translated into vernacular languages, but such translations should be approved by church authority and accompanied by proper interpretation to prevent error. The goal is accessibility without abandoning orthodoxy.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez looks around the chamber. \"Does this reflect the council's position? Vernacular preaching and Scripture—yes. But with maintained church oversight and authority over doctrine—also yes.\"\n\nBishop de Isorna nods slowly. \"If framed this way... if Basel insists on oversight mechanisms... this could be acceptable. We are not granting unchecked preaching. We are allowing the language to change while the authority structure remains.\"\n\nThe Bishop of Palencia speaks eagerly: \"And Your Majesty, this could actually strengthen the Church! If people truly understand what is taught, if they can read Scripture with proper guidance, they become better Christians, harder to lead into heresy, not easier!\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez turns to you. \"Your Majesty, you have guided us through all four articles. Let me summarize what I believe is now Castile's position for Basel, and you can correct me if I misstate.\"\n\nHe speaks slowly, ensuring clarity:\n\n\"Article One—Free Preaching: We support preaching in vernacular languages to make God's word accessible to all people. However, such preaching must remain under episcopal supervision to ensure doctrinal consistency and prevent heresy. Properly trained priests, teaching orthodox doctrine, but in the people's language.\"\n\n\"Article Two—Communion in Both Kinds: We believe this practice could be restored on theological grounds through proper church council deliberation. If Basel determines this would help restore Bohemia to communion with Rome, Castile would support this decision.\"\n\n\"Article Three—Church Property: Completely rejected. The Church requires material resources to fulfill its mission. The sin is in misusing wealth, not in possessing it. The Hussite seizures in Bohemia demonstrate hypocrisy, enriching nobles rather than serving apostolic poverty.\"\n\n\"Article Four—Punishment of Clerical Sin: We agree with the principle that clergy who commit mortal sins must be punished severely. However, this must be handled through church oversight mechanisms, not secular courts. The Church must police itself rigorously, but maintain its independence from secular authority.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds: \"And His Majesty commits that if Basel's negotiations fail to restore Bohemia to church unity, Castile will march as the Church's sword against heresy.\"\n\nThe Archbishop looks at you with profound respect. \"Is this an accurate summary of Castile's position, Your Majesty?\""

Navigate the complex politics at Basel\n\nLikely candidates would include:\n- Bishop de Cartagena - the scholar, moderate, articulate\n- Someone more conservative to balance\n- Perhaps Fray Hernando de Talavera (though Juan didn't want to send him earlier)\n- Maybe representatives from different orders\n\nThe bishops would discuss this among themselves. Juan has done his part - now they need to select the delegation.\n\nI should have the Archbishop lead this discussion and propose candidates, with various bishops weighing in. This is a natural conclusion to the council session.\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez's eyebrows rise slightly at your commitment regarding Constantinople. \"Your Majesty, that is... extraordinary. The Byzantine Emperor has been pleading for Western aid for decades. To have a monarch leading a successful crusade commit to future assistance...\" He exchanges meaningful glances with the other bishops. \"This will carry immense weight at Basel, where negotiations with the Greeks are planned.\"\n\nBishop de Cartagena adds: \"The contrast, Your Majesty, will not be lost on anyone. While most of Christendom loses crusades or ignores them entirely, Castile wins in Granada and offers to help Constantinople. This gives our delegation moral authority few others possess.\"\n\nThe Archbishop nods, then addresses the chamber: \"His Majesty asks the critical question—who should represent Castile at Basel?\"\n\nThe bishops exchange thoughtful looks.

If we send only those sympathetic to reform, Rome will be displeased. If we send only conservatives, Basel will dismiss us as papal puppets.\"\n\nThe Bishop of Palencia suggests tentatively: \"Perhaps Bishop de Cartagena himself? He has demonstrated both theological depth and the ability to articulate nuanced positions today.\"\n\nSeveral bishops murmur agreement. De Cartagena looks surprised but doesn't object.\n\n\"And,\" Bishop de Ávila adds, his voice more thoughtful than earlier, \"someone who can convey His Majesty's position on church authority and accountability. Someone who understands that reform does not mean rebellion.\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez looks thoughtful. \"We should also consider representatives from the religious orders. Perhaps a Franciscan and a Dominican? They bring different perspectives and have experience preaching to common people—relevant to the first article.\"\n\nThe Franciscan friar who spoke earlier looks startled but attentive.\n\nThe Abbott speaks: \"And someone with experience in church administration, who understands the practical challenges of reform. Perhaps someone from the Archbishop's staff?\"\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez turns to you: \"Your Majesty, you initially considered sending Fray Hernando de Talavera. Do you still wish to keep your personal confessor in Castile, or would his theological depth serve the delegation well?\"\n\nThe question hangs in the air—this is ultimately your decision, though the bishops will offer their recommendations.\n\nWhat is your preference, Your Majesty?"

Make them instruments of Your peace.\n\n\"And Lord, we pray especially for Your servant King Juan, who bears burdens beyond his years.

Grant him the outcome he desires—that the sword may remain sheathed, that Christian blood need not be spilled by Christian hands.\n\n\"We pray for Queen Isabel, who will join her prayers to ours. Comfort her in her faith, strengthen her in her devotion.\n\n\"We pray for Pope Eugenius, that pride not blind him to necessary reform.

Now I should provide the user with the link to view it and wrap up the chapter properly.\n\nView Chapter 32 Complete Summary\n\nChapter 32 is now complete, Your Majesty.\n\nThe summary captures all major events:\n\nThe fractious Toledo council and Basel's legal standing\n\nYour profound public confession about the military academy\n\nThe systematic discussion of all four Hussite articles\n\nYour commitments to Constantinople and Bohemia\n\nThe formation of the six-person delegation to Basel\n\nBishop de Cartagena's moving closing prayer\n\nThe formal delegation document with Castile's positions\n\nThis was a transformative chapter. You guided learned bishops through questions they had avoided, demonstrated extraordinary vulnerability by confessing sin publicly, and articulated sophisticated middle-ground positions on church reform that earned profound respect from clergy decades your senior.\n\nThe delegation will depart for Basel in early March 1432, arriving approximately 5-6 weeks later. They carry Castile's positions: supporting vernacular preaching and communion in both kinds (on theological grounds), rejecting church property seizure, and demanding stronger internal oversight for clerical sin.\n\nYour commitment stands: Peace if possible through negotiation. War if necessary should Basel fail to restore Bohemia to communion with Rome.\n\nWhen you're ready, we can begin Chapter 33 with campaign preparations, the delegation's departure, or other matters requiring your attention in late February/early March 1432."
