          "text": "From Chapter 44, the Te Deum was April 5, 1433, and Juan departed for Rome with 800 crusaders. The character database says Isabel is awaiting Juan's return \"expected late July/August 1433.\"\n\nSo Juan has been away from Isabel since at least early April 1433. That's about 4-5 months. And before that, he was in Granada for the Te Deum. Let me check what the recent chapters say about the timeline.\n\nLet me search for more context about the current timeline and what has happened with Juan's journey.\n\nActually I already have much of that in the search results. The reunion roll was 12/100 - \"Guarded Relief\". Her walls eventually crumbled in private.\n\nNow I need to set the scene for Juan going to spend the night with Isabel for the first time since leaving. This is an intimate, emotional scene. Given the earlier reunion's tension, and her pregnancy, and her trauma, this should be handled with care and emotional authenticity.\n \nI'll craft a scene that captures the delicate emotional landscape of their reunion. The evening light will soften the chamber, creating an intimate atmosphere that reflects their complex emotional state. Isabel's pregnancy will be central - her vulnerability, her strength, her careful guardedness slowly melting into genuine connection with Juan.\n\nIt's the evening of June 22, 1433. Juan has:\n1. Arrived in Toledo after an exceptional 15-day journey\n2. Had the courtyard reunion where Isabel was guarded\n3. Had the private reunion where Isabel broke down and confessed her terror about the pregnancy\n4. Spent time playing with Catalina - flying her around, making Isabel laugh genuinely\n5. Just finished his meeting with Álvaro de Luna in the royal study\n\nNow he's going to spend the night with Isabel for the first time since leaving for Rome and Basel. They've been apart since early April (about 2.5 months), plus before that he was at the Te Deum in Granada.\n\nThe emotional context:\n- Isabel is pregnant (about 6-7 months), due late July/August\n- The physicians say the baby is positioned wrong - like Catalina was\n- She nearly died with Catalina's birth\n- She's been terrified and maintaining composure as queen\n- She finally broke down earlier today, confessing her fear\n- Juan promised to stay by her side\n- The afternoon with Catalina brought genuine laughter\n- The meeting with Álvaro is now done\n\nThis should be an intimate, tender scene. Given Isabel's pregnancy and fears, and that they're reunited after months apart, this should be emotionally charged but handled with delicacy.\n\nThis shouldn't be too long - it's an intimate private moment between husband and wife.\n\nCHAPTER 2.10\n\nThe Vigil\n\nJune 22, 1433 — Evening\nAlcázar of Toledo\n\nThe meeting with Álvaro concluded as the last light faded from the study windows. Toledo's summer heat had softened into evening warmth, the thick stone walls of the Alcázar finally releasing the day's accumulated weight. Servants moved quietly through corridors, lighting candles and opening casements to admit what breeze might stir from the river below.\n\nThe walk to the royal chambers took only moments—the route memorized from years of habit—yet felt unfamiliar after so many months abroad. Different tapestries hung in the corridor. A bust he didn't recognize. Some functionary had been making improvements in his absence.\n\nThe guard at Isabel's door—a grizzled veteran who'd served Juan's father—offered a respectful nod and opened the heavy oak without announcement. There was no need. The Queen expected him.\n\nThe chamber was lit by candles clustered on the window ledge, their flames dancing in the faint breeze. Isabel sat at her dressing table, Doña Beatriz having just finished braiding her hair for the night. The Portuguese lady-in-waiting looked up as Juan entered, curtsied smoothly, and withdrew without a word—closing the door softly behind her.\n\nIsabel watched him in the polished silver mirror as he approached. She wore a simple linen shift, white against her olive skin, her pregnant belly visible now without the formal gowns of the day. Seventeen months since Catalina. Seven months along, perhaps a little more. The physicians' warnings hung in the air like smoke from the candles.\n\n\"She finally fell asleep,\" Isabel said, meaning Catalina. \"She was asking for Pa until her eyes closed. I think she's decided you're allowed to stay.\"\n\nShe turned on the little stool to face him. In the candlelight, the terror that had consumed her earlier—the raw confession of mortality and fear—had given way to something quieter. Exhaustion, perhaps. The relief of having finally spoken the unspeakable. Or simply the bone-deep weariness of a pregnant woman who had spent months pretending she wasn't afraid.\n\nHer eyes found his.\n\n\"I rehearsed this moment a hundred times while you were gone. What I would say. How I would look. Whether I would cry or be brave.\" A small, self-deprecating smile touched her lips. \"All those rehearsals, and when you actually arrived, I couldn't say anything at all. I just... managed.\"\n\nShe extended her hand toward him—a simple gesture, palm upward, fingers slightly curled.\n\n\"I don't want to manage anymore tonight. Not with you. Just... come here.\""

The wet-nurse is with her—she'll sleep through the night now, God willing. She exhausted herself asking for you.\"\n\nA soft laugh. \"Doña Beatriz said she kept pointing at the door and saying Pa until she simply couldn't keep her eyes open anymore.

She rises from the stool, moving with the careful deliberation of late pregnancy, and takes his hand. \"Come.\"\n\nThe nursery adjoins the royal chambers through a small antechamber. Isabel opens the door slowly, silently, with the practiced care of a mother who has done this a hundred times without waking the child within.\n\nThe room is dim, lit only by a single candle in a glass housing on the far table. The wet-nurse—a sturdy woman from a village near Talavera—dozes in a chair by the window, her breathing soft and even. She stirs slightly at the door's movement but doesn't wake.\n\nAnd there, in a small carved bed with low rails to keep her from rolling, lies Catalina.\n\nShe sleeps on her back, arms thrown wide in that peculiar abandon only small children possess—complete surrender to unconsciousness. Her dark hair, Isabel's hair, curls damply at her temples. Her lips are slightly parted, and in the candlelight Juan can see the tiny rise and fall of her chest beneath the light blanket.\n\nSeventeen months old. Walking now. Speaking a few words. Pa.\n\nShe is so small. So impossibly small. And yet in the soft curve of her cheek, the set of her brow even in sleep, he can see echoes—of Isabel, of his own mother, of bloodlines stretching back through centuries of Castilian kings and Portuguese queens.\n\nThis afternoon she pulled his beard and laughed. She called him Pa and fell asleep against his chest.\n\nIsabel stands beside him in the doorway, her hand still in his, watching him watch their daughter."

And voices. Hushed but urgent.\n\nA soft knock comes at the outer door of the antechamber. Doña Beatriz's voice, carefully modulated: \"Your Majesty? Forgive the intrusion. Don Álvaro sends word—there are matters requiring attention when you are ready. Nothing urgent, he says, but... accumulated correspondence. And the Masters of Santiago and Calatrava have sent riders ahead. They will arrive sooner than expected. Perhaps within the week.\""

For a moment his heart lurches—then he hears the giggling.\n\nHis daughter is on the floor near the foot of the bed, engaged in serious negotiations with a wooden horse that has seen better days. She holds it by one leg and appears to be explaining something to it with great conviction in a language composed entirely of sounds that are not quite words.\n\nShe looks up when the door opens.\n\nHer face transforms—eyes widening, mouth opening into a perfect circle of surprise and delight.

Inside, Isabel sleeps on, morning light now fully illuminating her face, her dark hair spread across the pillow.\n\n\"Ready?\" Juan whispers to Catalina.\n\nShe nods solemnly, not understanding but committed to whatever conspiracy this might be.\n\nOne great swooping arc around the room—Catalina's feet nearly brushing the canopy—and then Juan brings her in low over the bed, descending toward Isabel's face like a very small, very giggly falcon.\n\n\"Mama!\" Catalina cries, and plants a wet, enthusiastic kiss directly on Isabel's nose.\n\nIsabel's eyes fly open."

          "text": "The days that follow Juan's return become something none of them expected: ordinary.\n\nNot the ordinariness of peasants or merchants—there are still servants and guards, still the weight of a kingdom waiting beyond the chamber doors—but the ordinariness of a family. Breakfast with Catalina. Walks in the palace gardens during the cooler morning hours. Isabel resting in the afternoon heat while Juan reviews correspondence or plays with his daughter in the nursery.\n\nAnd slowly, remarkably, the fear begins to lift.\n\nThe First Week (June 23-29)\n\nThe Portuguese physicians—the same men who saved Isabel's life eighteen months ago—arrive from Lisbon with Queen Leonor's blessing. They examine Isabel thoroughly, their faces grave with professional concern.\n\nThen something unexpected happens.\n\n\"The baby has turned,\" Dr. Gonçalo announces, unable to entirely hide his surprise. \"Head down, properly positioned. This is... this is not what we expected, Your Majesty.\"\n\nIsabel stares at him. \"But you said—the warnings—\"\n\n\"I know what we said.\" The elderly physician shakes his head slowly. \"The signs were concerning. The baby's position three weeks ago suggested another difficult presentation. But bodies are not machines. Sometimes they surprise us.\"\n\nHis colleague, Dr. Álvares, adds more cautiously: \"We must still be vigilant. The Queen's previous birth caused damage that increases risk regardless of the baby's position. But this—\" he gestures vaguely, \"—this is considerably better than we feared.\"\n\nThe Second Week (June 30 - July 6)\n\nThe improvement continues.\n\nIsabel's swelling—which had worried the physicians—subsides. Her color improves. The exhaustion that had plagued her for months gives way to something approaching normal energy for late pregnancy. She begins taking short walks again, leaning on Juan's arm, Catalina toddling alongside them with Doña Beatriz in pursuit.\n\n\"I don't understand it,\" Isabel confesses one evening, her hand resting on her belly. \"I was so certain something was wrong. I could feel it. And now...\"\n\nShe looks at Juan with something like wonder.\n\n\"Do you think—\" she hesitates. \"Do you think God heard us? All those prayers?\"\n\nThe Third Week (July 7-13)\n\nThe Military Order Masters arrive—Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara—and Juan must turn his attention to matters of state. But he keeps his promise: he remains in Toledo, conducts all meetings in the Alcázar, and returns to Isabel and Catalina each evening.\n\nDr. Gonçalo requests a private audience with Juan.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I have practiced medicine for thirty-four years. I attended the Queen's first birth. I saw what it did to her body.\" The old man's voice is careful, precise. \"What I am seeing now... I cannot explain it medically. Her recovery from the previous birth appears more complete than we assessed. The baby's position is ideal. Her health is genuinely good—not merely adequate, but good.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"I am not a priest, Your Majesty. I do not speak of miracles. But I will say this: I came to Toledo expecting to fight for two lives. Now I am cautiously optimistic that I will not need to fight at all.\"\n\nThe Fourth Week (July 14-20)\n\nIsabel laughs more now. Real laughter, the kind Juan remembers from before Catalina's birth, before the fear took root.\n\nShe plays with Catalina in the mornings, though she tires more quickly as the pregnancy advances. She attends Mass daily, her prayers no longer desperate pleas but something gentler—gratitude mixed with hope.\n\n\"I was so afraid,\" she tells Juan one night, lying beside him in the darkness. \"For months, I was certain I was going to die. I could feel it waiting for me, like a shadow. And now...\"\n\nShe takes his hand and places it on her belly. The baby kicks—strong, insistent.\n\n\"Now I think I might live. I think we might all live.\"\n\nLate July, 1433\n\nThe physicians estimate the delivery will come in the first weeks of August. They have prepared everything: the birthing chamber, the midwives, the herbs and instruments. But there is a different quality to their preparations now—efficiency rather than dread.\n\nQueen Leonor arrives from Portugal, bringing additional physicians and her own calm presence. She embraces her daughter, then stands back to look at her.\n\n\"You look well,\" she says, and there is wonder in her voice. \"Isabel, you look well.\"\n\n\"I feel well, Mama.\" Isabel's smile is radiant. \"For the first time in months, I feel well.\"\n\nCurrent Status (Late July 1433):\n\nIsabel's pregnancy has progressed exceptionally\n\nBaby positioned correctly (head down)\n\nIsabel's health genuinely good—beyond all expectations\n\nPhysicians cautiously optimistic rather than grimly prepared\n\nQueen Leonor present for the birth\n\nDelivery expected early August\n\nJuan has kept his promise—he has not left Toledo\n\nThe delivery itself awaits. But for now, against all expectations, hope has replaced fear.\n\nWhat would you like to do before the birth begins?"

          "text": "THE MASTERS ARRIVE\n\nEarly July 1433\n\nThe riders arrived two days before their masters—outriders bearing the banners of three Orders that had fought for Christendom in Iberia for three centuries. Black crosses of Santiago. Red crosses of Calatrava. Green crosses of Alcántara.\n\nBy the third of July, all three Masters had reached Toledo.\n\nTHE INDIVIDUAL AUDIENCES\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán, Master of Santiago\n\nJuly 3, 1433 — Late Morning\n\nThe Master of Santiago arrived first, as befitted the largest and wealthiest of the Orders. Don Luis de Guzmán rode through Toledo's gates with a modest escort of twelve knights—deliberately understated for a man who commanded 83 commanderies and 2,000 fighting men.\n\nHe had aged visibly since the crusade began. The campaigns along the western coast had carved new lines into his face, and gray now dominated his beard. But his bearing remained that of a soldier at ease with authority.\n\nJuan received him privately in the small audience chamber adjacent to the royal study. No scribes. No witnesses save Captain Robles at the door.\n\nDon Luis knelt formally, then rose at Juan's gesture. His eyes were watchful but not hostile—the gaze of a man who had learned to read kings during thirty years of Order politics.\n\n\"Your Majesty. I came as quickly as the summons allowed.\" A pause. \"Your letter mentioned matters of great consequence for the Orders.\"\n\nJuan produced the papal decree—the heavy parchment bearing the Fisherman's Ring and twenty-three cardinal signatures. He handed it to the Master without preamble.\n\nDon Luis read in silence. His expression shifted subtly as he progressed through the articles—recognition, then careful blankness, then something harder to identify. When he reached Article Two, he stopped and read it again. And again.\n\n\"...perpetual and permanent control over the Military Orders of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara... The Masters of these Orders shall be appointed by the Crown of Castile...\"\n\nA long exhale. Don Luis set the document on the table between them with exaggerated care, as if it might shatter.\n\n\"I see.\" His voice was neutral—professionally so. \"And has Your Majesty already determined who shall be appointed as Master of Santiago?\"\n\nDon Pedro González de Padilla, Master of Calatrava\n\nJuly 3, 1433 — Afternoon\n\nThe Master of Calatrava was a different man entirely. Where Don Luis cultivated inscrutability, Don Pedro wore his heart closer to the surface. He had wept openly at Juan's speech before Íllora. He had embraced Juan after Loja fell.\n\nNow he sat in the same chair Don Luis had occupied hours before, reading the same decree. His weathered hands trembled slightly as he held the parchment.\n\n\"Perpetual,\" he said finally. \"Irrevocable. No pope may revoke.\" He looked up. \"Your Majesty, I have served Calatrava for twenty-three years. I became a knight when I was seventeen. The Order is...\"\n\nHe stopped, struggling for words.\n\n\"The Order was my purpose. To fight the Moor. To defend Christendom's frontier.\" His voice cracked slightly. \"And now the frontier is gone. Granada is Christian. The Reconquista is complete. What is Calatrava for now?\"\n\nIt was not accusation. It was genuine bewilderment—a soldier confronting the end of the war that had defined his entire life.\n\n\"I followed you into Granada because I believed in the crusade. I believe still. But this—\" he gestured at the decree, \"—this is not just about who appoints whom. This is about what we are.\"\n\nDon Juan de Sotomayor, Master of Alcántara\n\nJuly 3, 1433 — Evening\n\nThe youngest of the three Masters—though \"young\" was relative; he had commanded Alcántara for eight years—Don Juan de Sotomayor received the news with the controlled stillness of a man who had learned to survive by revealing nothing prematurely.\n\nHe read the decree twice, asked to examine the seals, studied the cardinal signatures. When he finally spoke, his voice was measured.\n\n\"The Pope has granted this freely? There was no... coercion? No threat to the Holy Father?\"\n\nHe seemed to accept Juan's answer, though his eyes remained calculating.\n\n\"Alcántara is the smallest of the three Orders,\" he said. \"We hold perhaps fifty commanderies, mostly in northern Extremadura. Our knights number fewer than Calatrava, far fewer than Santiago.\" A careful pause. \"What happens to us now matters less to the realm than what happens to my brothers' Orders. But it matters greatly to me and to my knights.\"\n\n\"What assurances can Your Majesty offer that Alcántara will not simply be... absorbed? Dissolved? Our lands distributed to reward loyal nobles?\"\n\nTHE JOINT MEETING\n\nJuly 4, 1433 — Morning\nRoyal Council Chamber, Alcázar of Toledo\n\nThe three Masters sat on one side of the long table. Álvaro de Luna sat at Juan's right hand, his dark eyes moving between the Masters with the patient attention of a man who had spent decades navigating exactly these kinds of tensions.\n\nThe mood was not hostile, but neither was it comfortable. These were proud men—men who had commanded armies, administered vast territories, answered to no king for centuries. The papal decree was legitimate; they did not dispute it. But legitimacy and acceptance were not the same thing.\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán spoke first, his voice carrying the weight of the senior Master present.\n\n\"Your Majesty. We have each read the Pope's decree. We acknowledge its authority. The Holy Father has spoken, and we are faithful sons of the Church.\" He paused. \"But we have questions. Concerns. We would hear from Your Majesty's own lips what you intend for our Orders.\"\n\nDon Pedro nodded, his earlier emotion now contained but still visible beneath the surface. \"What are we for now? The Moor is defeated. The frontier is gone.\"\n\nDon Juan de Sotomayor leaned forward slightly. \"And what happens to our knights? Our commanderies? Our traditions?\"\n\nÁlvaro remained silent, watching Juan. This was the King's moment—the Constable would not speak unless called upon.\n\nThe three Masters waited."

          "text": "Thank you all for coming. We have won a great victory and now is the time to set our sights on new glories. The orders were founded to drive the moors from Iberia. Now that this has been achieved, we must find a new purpose and make sure the military orders are in a good position to fulfill that purpose. The Moors are no more. The border forts in our kingdom may not be needed anymore. But this does not diminish the need for the orders at all. In fact, if christianity calls again, I might need the orders more than ever before.\n\n\nThe pope has granted me full authority over the orders, meaning that the men in this room can determine together how best to reshape the orders while preserving their traditions and identity. You all have served me and the crusade greatly so I seek no change in leadership.\n\n\nIn regards to what out next goals are: I see two major objectives. The first is eternal crusade against Morocco. I have already sent out informants to Morocco to look and see what cities are ripe for conquest. I see no problems in taking cities, but holding them is where the orders come in. Secondly, I will leave for constantinople next spring to see if we can drive the Ottomans from europe in the east as well. I have promised the Greeks 1000 knights from the orders to temporarily support the Greeks. Depending on what the actual situation is, we might commit to also fight in the east against the Ottomans. This will require the sustained campain, forts and commanderies the orders specialize in.\n\n\nEither way, we should make use of our new developed tactics and I hope the orders will send their officers to the War academy to learn these new tactics that are needed to fight the ottomans and the Moroccans.\n\n\nIn short, we must reform the orders so they can best face the new challenges. Challenges that are different from fighting Grenada so that naturally requires some different organization. But I have every intention to again let the orders take a pivotal role in our new campains. Castille and it's success and glory is because of the military orders who have contributed greatly to the reconquista and I will never forget that.\n\n\nDraft a d100 table to see how the masters react."

          "text": "**What Juan is proposing:**\n1. The Orders will continue to exist and have purpose\n2. No change in current leadership (they keep their positions)\n3. New mission: Morocco conquest and potentially Constantinople/Ottoman campaigns\n4. Orders should send officers to the War Academy to learn new tactics\n5. Reform the Orders for new challenges\n6. The crown now has perpetual authority over the Orders (per papal decree)\n\n**What the Masters are facing:**\n\n**Identity concerns:**\n- The Orders' entire identity was built around fighting the Moor in Iberia\n- Now that mission is complete\n- Being placed under crown control fundamentally changes their nature - they were semi-autonomous religious military orders answering to the Pope, not the king\n- This is a MAJOR identity shift\n\n**Loss aversion:**\n- They're losing autonomy (huge)\n- They're losing the ability to elect their own Masters (huge)\n- They're losing independence from royal control (huge)\n- They're potentially gaining... continued relevance? New missions?\n\n**Self-interest:**\n- Don Luis (Santiago): Largest Order, most to lose from crown control, but also most political experience\n- Don Pedro (Calatrava): Emotionally invested, confused about purpose, might be more receptive to clear direction\n- Don Juan de Sotomayor (Alcántara): Smallest Order, most worried about being absorbed/dissolved\n\n**What would historically realistic Military Order Masters think?**\n\nLet me consider what they actually hear in Juan's speech:\n\nPOSITIVE elements they'd appreciate:\n1. \"I seek no change in leadership\" - they keep their positions (huge relief)\n2. Clear new missions (Morocco, Constantinople) - gives them purpose\n3. Recognition of their contributions to Reconquista\n4. Promise of pivotal role in future campaigns\n5. Continuation of traditions and identity\n \nThe Masters perceive significant threats beneath Juan's seemingly diplomatic proposal. The vague language around \"reform\" and \"different organization\" triggers deep anxiety about their Orders' fundamental structure. They recognize the papal decree has stripped their traditional autonomy, leaving them with limited negotiating power. The proposed distant campaigns in Morocco and Constantinople feel like potential exile from their historical Iberian heartland, challenging their core identity and membership's willingness to serve.\n\nJuan's approach strategically balances respect with predetermined decision-making. By acknowledging their historical service while presenting a fait accompli, he offers a path of continued relevance rather than outright dissolution. The Masters understand they're being informed, not consulted - a crucial distinction that reveals the crown's true intentions of centralized control.\n\nThe historical precedent suggests eventual compliance, though not without internal resistance. Their survival depends on adapting to the changing political landscape, even if the transition feels uncomfortably orchestrated by royal and papal authorities.\n\nTheir primary concerns center on protecting institutional autonomy: preserving leadership positions, safeguarding territorial wealth, and maintaining some strategic independence. They'll likely negotiate subtly, seeking clarity on vague terms like \"reform\" and pushing back against implied obsolescence of their traditional military methods.\n\nThe Masters will strategically accept the papal decree while maneuvering to maximize their Order's continued significance. Internal political dynamics between different Orders will add complexity to their collective response, with each seeking marginal advantages in the emerging power structure.\n\nKey tensions include losing centuries of independent operational status, having knights committed without consultation, and facing potentially transformative institutional requirements like the War Academy mandate. Their cautious receptivity will balance formal compliance with strategic self-preservation.\n\nLet me analyze this using the NPC guide principles before creating the table.\n\nANALYSIS: MASTERS' REACTION TO JUAN'S SPEECH\n\nWhat Juan Is Offering:\n\nPositives for the Masters:\n\nNo change in current leadership — they keep their positions (HUGE relief)\n\nClear new missions providing purpose (Morocco, Constantinople)\n\nRecognition of their service and contributions\n\nPromise of continued pivotal role\n\nPreservation of traditions and identity (stated intent)\n\nSpecificity about future campaigns — not vague promises\n\nConcerns They Would Have:\n\nThe decision is fait accompli — they're being informed, not consulted\n\nThe 1,000 knights were already committed to Constantinople WITHOUT their input\n\n\"Reform\" is vague — what does this actually mean for their structures?\n\nWar Academy requirement implies their current methods are inadequate\n\nMorocco and Constantinople are overseas — far from Order territories, unfamiliar warfare\n\nCrown control is permanent and irrevocable — their autonomy is gone forever\n\nIdentity/Psychology Assessment:\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán (Santiago):\n\nMost political of the three, best able to calculate long-term implications\n\nSantiago is largest, most powerful — has most to lose from crown control\n\nBUT also most able to see that resistance is futile and cooperation is best path\n\nKeeping his position matters enormously\n\nDon Pedro González de Padilla (Calatrava):\n\nEmotionally invested, confused about purpose\n\nJuan's clear new mission might actually resonate with him deeply\n\nHe WANTS purpose — Juan is offering it\n\nMost likely to respond emotionally to the vision\n\nDon Juan de Sotomayor (Alcántara):\n\nMost cautious, worried about survival of smallest Order\n\nCalculating whether cooperation or resistance better serves Alcántara\n\nNeeds specific assurances about not being absorbed\n\nJuan didn't address his specific concern directly\n\nApproach Quality Assessment:\n\nStrengths:\n\nRespectful tone\n\nAcknowledges their service meaningfully\n\nClear vision for future\n\nLeadership continuity (critical)\n\nConnects new mission to Order traditions\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n\"Reform\" remains vague — they don't know what this means practically\n\nAlready committed 1,000 knights without consultation (reveals where real power lies)\n\nWar Academy comment could be read as criticism\n\nDidn't specifically address Alcántara's survival concerns\n\nNo specifics on how Order wealth/commanderies will be handled\n\nOverall: A solid, respectful approach that addresses their core fear (losing positions) while providing purpose. But lacks specifics on the \"reform\" that would reassure them about what's actually changing. The prior commitment of 1,000 knights without consultation subtly demonstrates that crown authority is already operational.\n\nD100 TABLE: MASTERS' REACTION\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nFormal Compliance, Deep Resistance — Masters accept the decree's legitimacy but their body language and careful words reveal profound unease. Don Luis raises pointed questions about what \"reform\" means that border on challenge. Don Juan de Sotomayor openly asks for written guarantees against dissolution. Don Pedro withdraws into silence. They will cooperate minimally while quietly working to limit crown authority in practice. Extensive negotiations needed before any real cooperation.\n11-25\nCautious Acceptance, Significant Concerns — Masters acknowledge the new reality but press hard for specifics. Don Luis wants detailed written protections for Order properties and revenues. Don Juan de Sotomayor demands explicit guarantees about Alcántara's continued existence. Don Pedro asks difficult questions about the War Academy—are their current knights inadequate? The 1,000-knight commitment made without consultation is raised as a concern. Productive meeting, but trust must be built gradually.\n26-40\nGuarded Cooperation — Masters accept Juan's vision but remain watchful. They appreciate the leadership continuity and the clear mission, but want more specifics on \"reform\" before fully committing. Don Luis speaks for all three when he requests a follow-up meeting to discuss practical details. The tone is professional rather than warm. They will cooperate, but will also protect their Orders' interests carefully.\n41-60\nConstructive Engagement — Masters are genuinely receptive to Juan's vision. Don Pedro, in particular, responds to the clarity of purpose Juan provides. Don Luis acknowledges that crown authority, properly exercised, could actually strengthen the Orders for their new mission. Don Juan de Sotomayor relaxes visibly when Juan emphasizes preserving traditions and identity. They raise practical questions (logistics, timelines, specifics of reform) but from a cooperative posture. Real dialogue begins.\n61-75\nPositive Reception — The Masters respond well to Juan's approach. Don Pedro is visibly moved by the vision of continued crusading purpose. Don Luis offers concrete suggestions for how the Orders might adapt. Don Juan de Sotomayor proposes that Alcántara could specialize in particular aspects of the new missions. The conversation shifts from \"what are you doing to us\" to \"how can we make this work.\" Álvaro exchanges a satisfied glance with Juan.\n76-90\nEnthusiastic Cooperation — Juan's speech strikes exactly the right notes. Don Pedro declares that this gives Calatrava the purpose it has been seeking since Granada fell. Don Luis, the most cautious, acknowledges that Juan has handled a difficult transition with unusual grace. Don Juan de Sotomayor volunteers Alcántara knights for the War Academy program. The Masters begin discussing practical implementation among themselves, treating Juan as partner rather than new overlord.\n91-100\nWholehearted Embrace — The Masters are genuinely inspired. Don Pedro weeps again—not from confusion this time, but from relief and renewed purpose. Don Luis sets aside political calculation and speaks from the heart about what it means to have a king who understands the Orders' value. Don Juan de Sotomayor pledges Alcántara's full commitment to whatever role Juan assigns. The meeting transforms from negotiation into planning session, with all three Masters actively competing to contribute ideas for the new crusading mission. A genuine partnership is forged.\n\nBaseline Assessment: Given Juan's solid but not perfect approach, the natural center of this table is around 41-60 (Constructive Engagement). Juan addressed their biggest fear (losing positions) and provided clear purpose, but left \"reform\" vague and revealed through the prior knight commitment that he's already exercising authority without consultation.\n\nPlease roll d100."

But words are not policy.\"\n\nHe glances at his fellow Masters, then continues.\n\n\"Santiago commands eighty-three commanderies. Vast lands in Extremadura, Murcia, Andalucía. Revenues that fund two thousand knights and their households. When Your Majesty speaks of reform—\" he lets the word hang, \"—what precisely does this mean for our properties? Our revenues? The rights we have held for three centuries?\"\n\nDon Pedro González de Padilla stirs, his earlier emotional vulnerability now hardened into something more defensive. \"Your Majesty mentioned the War Academy. That our officers should learn 'new tactics needed to fight the Ottomans and Moroccans.'\"\n\nHe pauses, and when he speaks again, there is an edge beneath the respect.\n\n\"Calatrava has fought the Moor for two hundred and seventy years. My knights broke the Granadan cavalry at Alcalá. We held the siege lines at Málaga through three weeks of sorties. We bled for the crusade Your Majesty led to victory.\" His jaw tightens. \"Are we now to be told our methods are... inadequate? That we must sit as students while others teach us war?\"\n\nDon Juan de Sotomayor has been silent, watching, calculating. Now he leans forward.\n\n\"Your Majesty said you seek no change in leadership. That you intend to preserve our traditions and identity.\" His voice is quiet but precise. \"Yet I notice Your Majesty did not address my specific concern from yesterday. Alcántara is the smallest of the three Orders. We hold fifty commanderies. Fewer knights than my brothers command.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands on the table.\n\n\"When resources are scarce and priorities must be set, the smallest is always first to be... rationalized. Absorbed. Dissolved for the greater good.\" His eyes meet Juan's directly. \"I would have written guarantees, Your Majesty. Explicit commitments that Alcántara will not simply disappear into Santiago or Calatrava when administrative convenience suggests it.\"\n\nDon Luis nods slowly, then raises another point—the one Juan perhaps hoped would pass unremarked.\n\n\"Your Majesty mentioned one thousand knights already committed to Constantinople. Committed to the Greeks.\" His tone remains respectful, but barely. \"This commitment was made, I understand, while Your Majesty was at Basel. Before this meeting. Before any consultation with the Orders whose knights are being committed.\"\n\nHe lets that sit for a moment.\n\n\"We do not dispute the Pope's decree. The Holy Father has spoken. Crown authority over the Orders is now... reality.\" The word comes out carefully. \"But if this authority is to be exercised wisely—if the Orders are to serve Castile as effectively as Your Majesty desires—then perhaps future commitments might benefit from... consultation. Before they are made.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna remains silent at Juan's side, his face unreadable. This is the King's negotiation to conduct.\n\nThe three Masters wait. They have accepted the new order—but they are making clear that acceptance is not the same as surrender, and cooperation must be earned, not assumed."

      "summary": "Juan addresses the Masters' concerns point by point: the War Academy is an invitation not an order, the 1,000 knights commitment was a diplomatic necessity, reform details will follow once purpose is defined, and he offers a written charter guaranteeing Alcantara's continued identity. Sotomayor relaxes at the charter offer. Juan then asks Sotomayor specifically to advise on the Constantinople operation. Roll 91 (Exceptional): Sotomayor delivers a brilliant phased approach - 300-knight vanguard for assessment, 90-day evaluation answering three key questions about defensibility, then calibrated commitment based on results. He also insists on extraction planning. Roll 78 (Masterful Navigation): Sotomayor proposes force composition (150 Santiago, 100 Calatrava, 50 Alcantara, 50 crown soldiers) and artfully positions himself as commander without appearing to grab for power. Even Don Luis acknowledges his political skill and endorses his leadership. Juan formally appoints Sotomayor as commander with a decree, 60,000 florins treasury, and orders to depart from Cartagena with assembly by early August.",

Understand that I could not say to the Greeks: \"Let me first discuss with the masters of my order if and how we can send any help.\" I gave the Greeks my word as king.

But understand that I had to balance committing to aid to the Greeks and discussing the operation with you, which we are doing now.\n\n\nYou ask what reform looks like. We should first make sure we understand what your new purpose is exactly. Only then can we determine in what way the orders should be reformed.

Juan's responses are reasonable and address concerns directly. The Alcántara charter offer is particularly good - a concrete commitment.\n\nI should show:\n1. Some softening of positions, particularly from Sotomayor\n\n2. Continued caution from Don Luis (the most political)\n3. Don Pedro perhaps still processing but less defensive\n4. Movement toward actual discussion of substance\n\nThe negotiation dynamics are shifting subtly. Don Luis remains politically calculated, probing Juan's intentions with measured skepticism. Don Pedro's initial defensiveness is softening, showing he's willing to engage. Sotomayor, having received his concrete guarantee, is more open to dialogue. The conversation is moving from confrontation to potential collaboration, with each Master carefully testing the boundaries of trust and commitment.\n\nThe atmosphere in the chamber shifts—subtly, but perceptibly.\n\nDon Juan de Sotomayor sits back in his chair, and something in his posture eases. The offer of a written charter—specific, concrete, addressing his exact concern—has landed precisely where it needed to.\n\n\"A charter,\" he repeats, almost to himself. Then, more formally: \"Your Majesty, that is... that is what I asked for. If Alcántara's identity and continued existence can be guaranteed in writing, then Alcántara will serve the crown faithfully in whatever capacity is required.\"\n\nHe inclines his head—not deeply, but genuinely. One concern addressed. One Master, if not won, at least reassured.\n\nDon Pedro's defensiveness has softened as well. The clarification about the War Academy—invitation, not order—has salved the wound to professional pride.\n\n\"An invitation,\" he says slowly. \"Then I... may have spoken too sharply, Your Majesty. Calatrava has always sought to improve. If new tactics exist that will help us fight the enemies of Christ more effectively...\" He trails off, then nods. \"I will send officers to observe. To learn what may be useful.\"\n\nIt is not enthusiastic embrace. But it is cooperation.\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán remains the most guarded. He has listened to Juan's explanations with the attention of a man parsing a contract for hidden clauses.\n\n\"Your Majesty's position regarding Constantinople is... understandable,\" he allows. \"A king must be able to make commitments. And you are correct—we are discussing the operation now, which is consultation of a sort.\"\n\nOf a sort. The qualifier hangs in the air.\n\n\"But I would note, for future reference, that the Orders' value lies not merely in our knights' swords but in our knowledge. Our experience. Our understanding of logistics, of garrison warfare, of holding territory far from home.\" His eyes meet Juan's steadily. \"If Castile is to campaign in Morocco, in Constantinople, in lands none of us have seen—that experience may prove valuable. Before commitments are made. Not merely after.\"\n\nHe is not challenging Juan's authority. He is making a case for his own relevance—positioning Santiago as an asset to be consulted, not merely a resource to be deployed.\n\nThen he shifts, moving toward substance.\n\n\"Your Majesty says we must first understand our new purpose before we can discuss reform. This is logical.\" He glances at his fellow Masters. \"So let us discuss purpose. You have mentioned two objectives: Morocco and Constantinople. These are very different campaigns. Different terrain. Different enemies. Different distances from Castile.\"\n\nDon Pedro nods, his soldier's mind engaging now that bruised pride has been set aside. \"Morocco is across the strait. Close. Reinforcement and supply are possible. Constantinople is...\" He shakes his head. \"Months away by sea. Fighting there means fighting far from home, far from support.\"\n\nDon Juan de Sotomayor adds quietly: \"And the Ottomans are not the Moors of Granada. Everything we hear suggests they are more numerous, better organized, better equipped. The Greeks have been losing to them for decades.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna speaks for the first time, his voice mild. \"These are precisely the questions His Majesty hoped to discuss with you. What would be required? What is realistic? What role can the Orders play—and what role should they play?\"\n\nThe three Masters exchange glances. The conversation has shifted from confrontation to consultation.\n\nDon Luis turns back to Juan.\n\n\"Very well, Your Majesty. Let us discuss purpose. You have our attention—and, provisionally, our cooperation.\" A pause, weighted with meaning. \"What would you have us consider?\""

Being singled out for advice by the King is a significant status boost. This validates him.\n\n2. **Self-interest:** He now has what he wanted (charter promise). He's in a cooperative mood. But he also wants to prove his worth - to demonstrate that Alcántara has value beyond mere numbers.\n\n3. **Face/Status in front of peers:** He's being asked in front of Don Luis (Santiago) and Don Pedro (Calatrava), who lead larger Orders. This is a chance to demonstrate that small doesn't mean insignificant.\n\n4. **Actual knowledge:** What does Sotomayor actually know about Constantinople? He's a Spanish military commander who has fought Moors, not Ottomans. He has no direct experience with:\n   - Ottoman tactics\n   - The terrain around Constantinople\n   - Naval logistics in the Eastern Mediterranean\n   - Greek politics or reliability\n\n5. **What he DOES know:**\n   - Garrison warfare\n   - Holding territory far from central authority\n   - Managing knights in hostile territory\n   - The challenges of overseas operations (from crusader history, if not personal experience)\n   - Practical military logistics\n\n**What would a realistic response look like?**\n\nHe's being asked to opine on something largely outside his direct experience. A smart man would:\n- Acknowledge the limits of his knowledge\n- Offer what insights he CAN provide (garrison experience, logistics principles)\n\n- Ask clarifying questions\n- Perhaps express caution about committing to something unknown\n\nI'll carefully probe the situation, recognizing my limitations while offering practical military wisdom. I understand the strategic importance of not appearing ignorant, but also of not overstepping my expertise. My response will balance humility with a demonstration of professional military insight, focusing on what I genuinely understand about military operations and territorial defense.\n\nThe approach shows deep respect for collaborative problem-solving. By inviting my perspective without demanding a complete solution, Juan creates an environment where honest, nuanced military thinking can emerge. I'll aim to contribute meaningfully while being transparent about the boundaries of my knowledge.\n\nLet me analyze this using NPC guide principles.\n\nANALYSIS: DON JUAN DE SOTOMAYOR'S REACTION\n\nContext:\n\nJuan has just given Sotomayor exactly what he asked for—a written charter guaranteeing Alcántara's continued existence. Now Juan is singling him out for advice, asking him specifically rather than the senior Masters. This is significant.\n\nPsychology Assessment:\n\nPositive Factors:\n\nHis core concern (Alcántara's survival) has been addressed\n\nBeing asked directly is a status boost—especially in front of larger Orders' Masters\n\nOpportunity to demonstrate Alcántara's value beyond mere numbers\n\nChance to position himself as trusted advisor, not just subordinate\n\nJuan's clarification (assess situation, not conquer Ottoman Empire) makes the question answerable\n\nComplicating Factors:\n\nHe has NO direct experience with Ottomans, Constantinople, or Eastern Mediterranean\n\nHis expertise is Iberian frontier warfare against Moors\n\nOverreaching his knowledge would be embarrassing in front of peers\n\nUnderperforming would waste the opportunity Juan has given him\n\nWhat He Actually Knows:\n\nGarrison warfare and holding territory\n\nManaging knights far from central authority\n\nLogistics of sustained military operations\n\nThe challenges of operating in hostile territory\n\nPractical military assessment (what can be held, what cannot)\n\nWhat He Doesn't Know:\n\nOttoman military capabilities (beyond rumors)\n\nConstantinople's defenses or geography\n\nGreek reliability as allies\n\nNaval logistics in Eastern Mediterranean\n\nLocal political dynamics\n\nRealistic Response Range:\n\nA competent military man in this position would likely:\n\nAcknowledge limits of his direct knowledge\n\nOffer principles from his actual experience that might apply\n\nAsk clarifying questions to understand the situation better\n\nBe cautious about firm recommendations on unfamiliar ground\n\nTry to demonstrate value without overreaching\n\nD100 TABLE: SOTOMAYOR'S RESPONSE\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nDefensive Deflection — Sotomayor freezes, uncomfortable at being singled out. He deflects to the senior Masters: \"Perhaps Don Luis, with Santiago's greater resources, would be better positioned to advise...\" This wastes the opportunity Juan offered and makes him appear weak before his peers. Don Luis's expression flickers with something like contempt. The dynamic shifts unfavorably.\n11-20\nCautious Non-Answer — Sotomayor hedges extensively. \"Your Majesty, I know little of Constantinople or the Turk. Alcántara has fought the Moor, not the Ottoman.\" He offers no insights, no questions, no engagement with the problem. Technically honest, but unhelpful. Juan's gesture of respect goes unrewarded. The consultation stalls.\n21-35\nHonest Limitation, Minimal Contribution — Sotomayor acknowledges his inexperience but offers only generic observations: supply lines matter, garrison morale is important, unfamiliar terrain is dangerous. Nothing wrong, but nothing particularly useful. The other Masters are not impressed. Juan may need to draw him out further or turn to others.\n36-50\nCautious but Constructive — Sotomayor admits his limits but engages seriously. He asks practical questions: How will knights reach Constantinople? How long must they hold? What support can Greeks actually provide? He frames his contribution as \"questions a garrison commander would ask\" rather than pretending expertise he lacks. Useful, if modest.\n51-65\nPractical Military Thinking — Sotomayor draws on his actual expertise. \"Your Majesty, I have held frontier posts far from reinforcement. The question is not how many knights you send, but what they can realistically accomplish.\" He raises logistics, rotation, exit strategy. He asks penetrating questions about Greek reliability. Demonstrates solid military judgment within his experience.\n66-80\nValuable Contribution — Sotomayor surprises the room with thoughtful analysis. He distinguishes between \"reinforcing a city that can hold\" versus \"sending men into a lost cause.\" He proposes that the first knights sent should include experienced assessors who can report honestly on Constantinople's actual defensibility. \"Before we commit more, we must know what we're committing to.\" Don Luis nods approvingly.\n81-90\nImpressive Insight — Sotomayor demonstrates unexpected strategic depth. He outlines a phased approach: initial reconnaissance force, honest assessment, then calibrated commitment. He raises the question of what happens to Order knights if Constantinople falls—extraction planning. He notes that Alcántara's smaller size might actually suit an initial assessment mission. \"We are accustomed to operating with fewer resources. That teaches careful judgment.\" The other Masters look at him with new respect.\n91-100\nExceptional Performance — Sotomayor seizes the opportunity brilliantly. He provides a coherent framework: immediate aid as promised (honor demands it), built-in assessment mechanism, clear criteria for escalation or withdrawal, rotation system to prevent knights being trapped indefinitely. He addresses both military and political dimensions. When finished, even Don Luis acknowledges: \"The Master of Alcántara speaks wisdom.\" Juan's decision to consult him specifically is validated. Sotomayor has established himself as a valuable voice in future councils.\n\nBaseline Assessment: Juan's approach is excellent—he's given Sotomayor what he wanted and is now offering him status and relevance. But Sotomayor is being asked about something outside his direct experience. The table centers around 36-50 (Cautious but Constructive) as the natural baseline—a competent professional engaging honestly with his limitations while trying to contribute what he can.\n\nPlease roll d100."

          "text": "Don Juan de Sotomayor is silent for a long moment after Juan's question. The other Masters watch him—Don Luis with polite skepticism, Don Pedro with neutral curiosity. The smallest Order. The youngest Master. Asked to advise the King on a campaign none of them have ever contemplated.\n\nThen something shifts in Sotomayor's bearing. He sits straighter. When he speaks, his voice carries a clarity that was not there before.\n\n\"Your Majesty honors me by asking.\" No false humility, no deflection. He accepts the question as his to answer.\n\n\"I know little of Constantinople. I have never seen the Bosphorus or faced Ottoman sipahis. But I know something of holding ground far from home with fewer men than the task demands. That is what Alcántara has done for two centuries.\"\n\nHe rises from his chair—not asking permission, simply needing to move as his mind works. The other Masters exchange glances but say nothing.\n\n\"Your Majesty has promised immediate aid. One thousand knights, sixty thousand florins. This promise must be kept—honor demands it, and Castile's word must mean something if we are to be taken seriously in the East.\" He turns to face Juan directly. \"But how we keep that promise matters as much as that we keep it.\"\n\nHe begins to pace, hands clasped behind his back.\n\n\"I would propose a phased approach. Three stages.\"\n\n\"First: The Vanguard.\"\n\n\"Send three hundred knights immediately. Not the full thousand—not yet. These three hundred should include your best captains, men capable of honest assessment. Their task is twofold: reinforce the walls, yes, but also see. See the defenses. See the Greek troops. See whether Constantinople can truly be held or whether we are pouring water into sand.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Include men who will tell you the truth even if the truth is ugly. Not courtiers seeking glory. Soldiers who understand that an honest report of failure is worth more than a flattering report of false hope.\"\n\n\"Second: The Assessment.\"\n\n\"Give these three hundred knights ninety days. At the end of ninety days, they send a report—not to the Greeks, not to the Pope, but to you, Your Majesty. This report answers three questions.\"\n\nHe holds up three fingers.\n\n\"One: Can Constantinople hold for five years with the forces available, including our support? Two: What would be required to make it hold for twenty years? Three: If it cannot hold—if the situation is truly desperate—how do we extract our knights before the walls fall?\"\n\nDon Luis stirs at this. \"You speak of... retreat? Before we have even arrived?\"\n\nSotomayor turns to the older Master without flinching. \"I speak of reality, Don Luis. Alcántara has held posts that could not be held. I have buried knights who died not because they failed, but because no one planned for what to do when success became impossible. I will not send Alcántara brothers to die in a city that is already lost without at least considering how to bring them home.\"\n\nA long pause. Don Luis inclines his head slightly—not agreement, perhaps, but acknowledgment.\n\n\"Third: Calibrated Commitment.\"\n\nSotomayor continues, his momentum building.\n\n\"Based on the assessment, Your Majesty decides. If Constantinople can hold—if our knights can make a difference—then send the remaining seven hundred. Rotate them on twelve-month deployments so no man is trapped indefinitely. Establish supply through Venetian or Genoese merchants; we cannot rely on Greek logistics alone.\"\n\nHe stops pacing and faces Juan.\n\n\"But if the assessment says Constantinople is lost—if the Ottomans will take it regardless of what we do—then Your Majesty must decide whether to die gloriously for a doomed city or preserve Castilian strength for battles we can actually win.\"\n\nHe lets that sit for a moment.\n\n\"Morocco, for instance. Close to home. Achievable. Sustainable. A victory there builds strength for future campaigns. A catastrophe at Constantinople might break us for a generation.\"\n\nDon Pedro González de Padilla speaks into the silence that follows. \"You have thought about this.\"\n\n\"I have thought about holding impossible positions,\" Sotomayor replies quietly. \"Constantinople is the most impossible position in Christendom. That does not mean we should abandon it. It means we should approach it with open eyes.\"\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán studies the younger Master with an expression that has shifted from skepticism to something approaching respect.\n\n\"The Master of Alcántara speaks wisdom,\" he says finally. The words come slowly, as if drawn out against his natural inclination. \"A phased approach. Assessment before full commitment. Extraction planning.\" He glances at Juan. \"These are not the words of a man seeking glory. They are the words of a man who has learned that glory without survival is merely a pretty death.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna permits himself a small smile. He catches Juan's eye briefly.\n\nSotomayor returns to his seat, his piece said. But he sits differently now—no longer the junior Master hoping not to be absorbed, but a counselor who has proven his worth.\n\nThe dynamic in the room has shifted."

Actually, looking back, the player didn't explicitly ask for a d100 table this time. They just asked the question directly.\n\nLet me think about whether I should:\na) Create a d100 table for this response\n\nb) Just roleplay Sotomayor's response based on his established characterization and the momentum of the scene\n\nI'll craft a nuanced response that balances political considerations. Sotomayor will propose a collaborative approach that demonstrates strategic thinking and diplomatic skill. He'll suggest a mixed force with proportional representation from each Order, plus a small contingent of Crown soldiers to symbolize royal support. For leadership, he'll recommend a joint command structure with rotating leadership between Order representatives, ensuring no single group feels marginalized.\n\nThe political strategy involves creating shared investment while subtly positioning himself as the intellectual architect behind the plan. By advocating for collective participation and a balanced leadership model, he maintains his influence without appearing overtly self-promoting.\n\nHis approach carefully balances personal ambition with diplomatic finesse, suggesting a structured selection process that highlights his strategic thinking without directly nominating himself. This nuanced political maneuvering demonstrates sophisticated understanding of institutional dynamics.\n\nANALYSIS: SOTOMAYOR'S RESPONSE ON COMPOSITION AND LEADERSHIP\n\nContext:\n\nSotomayor has just delivered an exceptional strategic framework. Now Juan is pressing further—asking him to propose specific force composition and, critically, leadership. This shifts from military analysis to political navigation.\n\nThe Challenge:\n\nForce composition is manageable—shared contribution from all three Orders is the obvious diplomatic answer.\n\nLeadership is treacherous:\n\nIf he proposes himself → could seem self-aggrandizing, grabbing glory\n\nIf he proposes another Master → gives away the opportunity he just created\n\nIf he proposes a crown commander → might offend the Orders collectively\n\nIf he deflects entirely → wastes the momentum he's built\n\nPsychology:\n\nSotomayor has just established himself as a serious voice. He's riding high on that success. But he's still the junior Master in the room, and Don Luis de Guzmán is watching carefully. Overreach now could undo the goodwill he's built.\n\nA truly exceptional political operator would find a way to:\n\nPosition himself as a candidate without overtly grabbing\n\nAcknowledge the sensitivities openly\n\nGive Juan room to make the decision while making clear he's willing to serve\n\nD100 TABLE: SOTOMAYOR'S POLITICAL NAVIGATION\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-15\nOverreach — Success goes to his head. Sotomayor proposes himself as commander too eagerly, framing it as logical extension of his analysis. Don Luis's expression hardens. The room's mood shifts—what seemed like wisdom now looks like self-promotion. Sotomayor has damaged the credibility he just built.\n16-30\nRetreat into Caution — Having shone brightly, Sotomayor suddenly fears overstepping. He deflects: \"Leadership must be Your Majesty's decision. I would not presume...\" The momentum dies. Juan is left without the guidance he sought. An opportunity wasted.\n31-45\nSafe but Unremarkable — Sotomayor handles composition well (shared contribution from all Orders plus crown soldiers) but punts on leadership, suggesting only general criteria: \"A man who can assess honestly and command respect.\" Competent but uninspired. Juan must draw him out further or turn elsewhere.\n46-60\nDiplomatic but Clear — Sotomayor proposes balanced composition and carefully suggests leadership criteria that happen to describe himself without naming himself. \"A commander from the smaller Orders might serve well—accustomed to doing much with little.\" Don Luis sees through it but cannot object to the logic. The door is opened without Sotomayor walking through it uninvited.\n61-75\nGraceful Positioning — Sotomayor addresses composition thoughtfully, then handles leadership with political skill. He acknowledges his own interest openly: \"I will not pretend I have not considered that Alcántara might serve well in this role. But I am not the only choice, and Your Majesty must weigh factors I cannot see.\" Honest, humble, but clearly available. The other Masters respect the candor.\n76-85\nMasterful Navigation — Sotomayor proposes a structure that serves everyone: mixed force from all three Orders plus crown observers, with leadership rotating or shared in ways that give each Order stakes. Then he addresses his own candidacy directly and disarmingly. He makes himself the obvious choice without ever claiming he should be chosen. Don Luis actually nods approval at the political craftsmanship.\n86-100\nExceptional Statesmanship — Sotomayor transcends the political trap entirely. He proposes composition, addresses leadership honestly, but then reframes the question in a way that elevates the entire discussion. He demonstrates that his investment is in the mission's success, not personal glory—and in doing so, makes himself the only logical choice while appearing selfless. Even Don Luis is impressed. Juan's decision to consult him is vindicated completely.\n\nBaseline Assessment: Sotomayor is riding momentum from his exceptional military analysis, but political navigation is a different skill. The center of this table is around 46-60—diplomatic handling that positions him without overreaching. His previous success (91) suggests he's performing well today, but that doesn't guarantee continued excellence in a different domain.\n\nPlease roll d100."

Earn Don Luis's approval for the political skill shown\n\nThis is a great outcome - Sotomayor continues to shine but in a different way. He shows he's not just militarily competent but politically astute as well.\n\nMASTERFUL NAVIGATION (Roll: 78)\n\nSotomayor does not answer immediately. He takes a breath, and when he speaks, there is a deliberateness to his words that suggests he understands exactly what ground he is walking on.\n\n\"Composition first,\" he says. \"That is the easier question.\"\n\nHe looks to each Master in turn as he speaks—including them, not lecturing.\n\n\"The vanguard should draw from all three Orders. Not equally—that would be foolish, given our different strengths—but visibly. When these knights ride through Constantinople's gates, the Greeks should see Santiago's black cross, Calatrava's red, Alcántara's green. They should see that Castile's entire crusading tradition stands with them, not merely one Order's ambition.\"\n\nDon Luis nods slightly. This is politically sound.\n\n\"I would propose: one hundred fifty from Santiago, one hundred from Calatrava, fifty from Alcántara.\" He holds up a hand before anyone can object. \"This reflects our relative strength. Santiago has more knights to spare; Alcántara fewer. But all three Orders share the burden and the honor.\"\n\nDon Pedro speaks: \"And crown soldiers?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Sotomayor turns to Juan. \"Your Majesty should include fifty men from the crown forces. Soldiers who answer to you directly, not to any Master. They serve two purposes: first, they demonstrate that this is Castile's mission, not merely the Orders' adventure. Second—\" he pauses, choosing words carefully, \"—they provide Your Majesty with eyes that owe no loyalty except to you. If a Master's report is... colored by pride or ambition, crown soldiers can provide a different perspective.\"\n\nA slight tension enters the room. Sotomayor has just suggested—politely, diplomatically—that the Orders' reports might not be entirely trustworthy. But he has included himself in that implicit criticism, which disarms it.\n\nDon Luis's eyes narrow, but he does not object. The logic is sound, even if it stings.\n\n\"And leadership.\"\n\nSotomayor's voice shifts. Slower now. More careful.\n\n\"This is the harder question. And I will not pretend I do not have personal interest in the answer.\"\n\nHe looks directly at Don Luis, then Don Pedro, then Juan.\n\n\"Alcántara is the smallest Order. We have always had to do more with less. That has taught us... economy. Careful judgment. The habit of asking 'what can we actually achieve' rather than 'what glory can we win.'\" A slight smile. \"It has also taught us humility, because we cannot afford pride we cannot pay for.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"I believe Alcántara would serve well in leading this vanguard. Not because we are greater than Santiago or Calatrava—we are not—but because the nature of this mission suits our experience. Assessment. Careful judgment. Holding ground with limited resources. Knowing when to fight and when to preserve strength for another day.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But I am not the only choice. And I am not so foolish as to think I see all factors Your Majesty must weigh.\"\n\nNow he does something unexpected. He turns to Don Luis de Guzmán.\n\n\"Don Luis. Santiago is the greatest of our Orders. If you believe Santiago should lead this vanguard, I will not contest it. I will send Alcántara's fifty knights under your command, and I will support that command loyally.\" His voice carries no resentment, no false humility—simply honest acknowledgment. \"The mission matters more than who leads it.\"\n\nDon Luis is silent for a long moment. His expression is unreadable.\n\nThen, slowly, the corner of his mouth twitches. Not quite a smile—Don Luis does not smile easily—but something approaching respect.\n\n\"The Master of Alcántara plays this game better than I expected,\" he says dryly. \"He makes himself the obvious choice while appearing to defer. He addresses his own ambition openly, which makes it seem like honesty rather than grasping. And he offers to serve under me, knowing I cannot accept such an offer without appearing to have stolen command from a man who clearly deserves it.\"\n\nHe shakes his head slowly.\n\n\"Well played, Don Juan. Well played indeed.\"\n\nSotomayor inclines his head, accepting the characterization without shame. \"I learned politics from watching Santiago, Don Luis. You have been an excellent teacher, even if you did not intend to be.\"\n\nSomething that might be a genuine smile flickers across Don Luis's face. \"Apparently so.\"\n\nDon Pedro laughs—a short, surprised bark. \"I thought we were discussing Constantinople. It seems we are also watching a masterwork of positioning.\"\n\nThe tension in the room has transformed. What could have been rivalry or resentment has become something closer to professional admiration. Sotomayor has made his case without alienating his peers—indeed, by being so transparent about his maneuvering, he has turned it into a shared joke rather than a threat.\n\nDon Luis turns to Juan, his expression settling into something more serious.\n\n\"Your Majesty asked for counsel. Here is mine: the Master of Alcántara has proposed a sound structure and has demonstrated exactly the kind of careful thinking this mission requires. I will not pretend I would not have welcomed command myself. But Don Juan has made his case well, and—\" a pause, as if the words cost him something, \"—I believe he may be the right choice for this particular task.\"\n\nHe glances at Don Pedro, who nods.\n\n\"Calatrava concurs. If Your Majesty wishes to appoint the Master of Alcántara to lead the vanguard, he will have our support.\"\n\nAll eyes turn to Juan."

Emphasize that assessing what the money CAN accomplish is part of the mission\n4. Perhaps ask about coordination with the 17 men already there\n\nThis doesn't need a d100 table - it's a practical question that follows from his appointment. He should answer honestly and practically, which is consistent with the character he's established.\n\nLet me write his response directly, showing him engaging seriously with the practical question while acknowledging the limits of his knowledge.\n\nSotomayor absorbs the appointment with a single nod—no effusive gratitude, no false modesty. He has argued for this command; now he must prove worthy of it.\n\nThe practical questions focus him immediately. His brow furrows.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I will answer honestly: I do not know if sixty thousand florins can repair Constantinople's walls. I have never seen them.\" He glances at Álvaro, then back to Juan. \"What I know of them comes from pilgrim tales and old chronicles. They say the Theodosian walls are the greatest fortifications in Christendom—triple walls, towers every fifty meters, a moat that can be flooded. They have stood for a thousand years.\"\n\nHe pauses, thinking through the implications.\n\n\"If those walls are intact and merely need garrison—sixty thousand florins is a fortune. We could supply defenders for years. But if the walls are crumbling, if centuries of neglect have left breaches and weak points...\" He shakes his head. \"Then sixty thousand florins might patch one section while three others fall. I cannot promise what I do not know.\"\n\nHis voice firms.\n\n\"But this is precisely why the assessment matters. The seventeen men Your Majesty already has in Constantinople—who leads them? What have they reported? If I am to command this mission, I must know what they have already learned.\"\n\nHe straightens, visibly shifting into the role of commander rather than counselor.\n\n\"With Your Majesty's permission, I would propose this: I will not spend the sixty thousand florins on walls until I have seen Constantinople myself. The money travels with us, secured. When I arrive, I meet with Your Majesty's men already there. I inspect the defenses. I speak with the Greeks—their engineers, their commanders, their Emperor if he will receive me.\"\n\nHe holds up a hand, ticking off points.\n\n\"Then I determine: What does Constantinople actually need? Is it walls? Is it men? Is it food, weapons, ships? Perhaps the walls are stronger than we fear and the money is better spent on supplies for a siege. Perhaps one critical section needs immediate repair while the rest can hold. Perhaps—\" his voice drops slightly, \"—the situation is already beyond what sixty thousand florins can remedy, and we must tell Your Majesty the hard truth.\"\n\nHe meets Juan's eyes directly.\n\n\"Sixty thousand florins is a tool, Your Majesty. I will not squander it on assumptions. I will spend it on what Constantinople actually needs—or I will bring it back and tell you that the city cannot be saved regardless of what we spend.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"Does this fit your goal of assessment? I believe it is the assessment. The money is not separate from the mission. How we use it—or whether we use it at all—will tell us whether Constantinople can hold.\""

Sotomayor needs to respond to this - acknowledging the constraint while perhaps asking clarifying questions about what constitutes \"extreme situations.\"\n\nHe also just learned the king himself is coming. This is significant - it means:\n- The assessment has a deadline (before spring 1434)\n- The stakes are even higher (the king's personal safety)\n- Sotomayor's role shifts from \"commander making final decisions\" to \"advance commander preparing for royal arrival\"\n\nLet me think about how Sotomayor would react. He's been doing well - roll of 78 on political navigation. He should:\n1. Accept the constraint on the funds gracefully\n2. Ask clarifying questions about \"extreme situations\"\n3. React to the news of Juan's personal travel\n4. Possibly express concern about the king's safety\n5. Ask practical questions about timeline, communication, etc.\n\nThis doesn't need a roll - it's a natural continuation of dialogue where Sotomayor is receiving instructions and responding professionally. He's already been appointed; now he's getting his orders.\n\nSotomayor listens carefully, and his expression shifts subtly as the full picture becomes clear.\n\n\"I understand, Your Majesty. The funds are committed—a promise already given. I will honor that promise unless circumstances make it genuinely impossible to do so.\" He pauses. \"May I ask what would constitute such an extreme situation in Your Majesty's view?

The King of Castile, traveling to the far end of the Mediterranean, to a city besieged by the greatest military power in the known world.\n\nSotomayor chooses his next words with evident care.\n\n\"Your Majesty, this changes the nature of my mission considerably. I am no longer merely assessing whether Constantinople can be saved. I am preparing the ground for my king's arrival.\" He lets that sit for a moment. \"The stakes of my assessment are no longer simply 'should we commit more knights.' They are 'is it safe for the King of Castile to set foot in this city.'\"\n\nHis voice firms.\n\n\"I will need to send regular reports. Not merely a final assessment after ninety days, but ongoing communication—monthly at minimum, more frequently if circumstances warrant. Your Majesty must know what awaits before you sail, not after you arrive.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then speaks with the directness of a soldier addressing his commander.\n\n\"And I must ask, Your Majesty: does the Queen know of this plan? You have an heir who is not yet two years old, and—God willing—another child coming. If Constantinople's walls should fail while you stand upon them...\"\n\nHe does not finish the sentence.

The journey involves multiple complex logistical challenges - gathering knights, securing transportation, and planning a safe passage through potentially dangerous waters. Timing is everything, and each stage requires meticulous planning to ensure the expedition's success.\n\nThe most probable scenario involves a gradual assembly process, with knights converging from different regions. By late summer, they could potentially set sail, though unexpected delays are always possible. Sotomayor's leadership will be crucial in managing these intricate preparations, ensuring smooth coordination among the various military orders.\n\nThe three Masters exchange glances at the revelation of the succession arrangement. Don Luis's eyes widen almost imperceptibly—this is significant political intelligence, the kind that reshapes how one thinks about the realm's future. Don Pedro absorbs it with a soldier's pragmatism. Sotomayor simply nods, filing it away.\n\nBut Juan has made clear the discussion of risk is closed. They are moving to logistics now.\n\nSotomayor's mind visibly shifts to practical matters. He turns to his fellow Masters.\n\n\"Don Luis. How quickly can Santiago muster one hundred fifty knights at a designated assembly point?\"\n\nDon Luis considers. \"Santiago's knights are spread across eighty-three commanderies. Extremadura, Murcia, Andalucía, León.\" He strokes his beard. \"If I send riders today with summons bearing the royal seal... three weeks to gather one hundred fifty quality men with horses and equipment. Faster if we accept whoever is nearest rather than selecting our best, but for a mission of this importance—\" he shakes his head. \"Three weeks. Perhaps four if we want them properly supplied.\"\n\nDon Pedro speaks next. \"Calatrava is more concentrated. Campo de Calatrava, the frontier fortresses—most now without purpose since Granada fell. I can have one hundred knights assembled in two weeks. Perhaps eighteen days to be certain they have everything they need.\"\n\nSotomayor nods. \"Alcántara is smallest and most compact. Fifty knights in two weeks. I will select men personally—those with experience in garrison command, assessment, the kind of careful judgment this mission requires.\"\n\nHe turns to Juan.\n\n\"The crown soldiers are Your Majesty's to command. How quickly can thirty men be made ready?\"\n\nBefore Juan can answer, Álvaro de Luna speaks quietly. \"A week. Perhaps less. We have capable men in Toledo who could depart within days if needed.\"\n\nSotomayor processes this, then addresses Juan directly.\n\n\"Your Majesty, the constraint is Santiago—the largest contingent from the most dispersed Order. If Don Luis sends riders tomorrow, we could have all three hundred assembled by...\" he calculates silently, \"...the first week of August. Call it August seventh to allow for delays.\"\n\nHe continues, thinking aloud now.\n\n\"Assembly point should be a port. No sense gathering in Toledo only to march to the coast. I would suggest Valencia or Cartagena—both have harbors capable of handling a force this size, and both offer the shortest route into the Mediterranean.\"\n\nDon Luis interjects. \"Valencia. Better shipwrights, more Genoese and Venetian traders who know the eastern routes. We can contract passage there more easily than Cartagena.\"\n\nSotomayor nods. \"Valencia, then. Assembly by August seventh.\" He pauses. \"Ships for three hundred knights, horses, equipment, and sixty thousand florins in treasury. That requires planning. Has Your Majesty already arranged transport, or must we contract vessels?\"\n\nHe is thinking through every element now—the commander's mind fully engaged.\n\n\"If ships must be contracted, we should send word to Valencia immediately. Arranging transport for this force could take as long as assembling it. The treasury especially—we need secure vessels, trustworthy captains. Sixty thousand florins is a tempting prize for pirates or unscrupulous merchants.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan, awaiting answers on the naval logistics before offering a final timeline."

Juan proposes installing Muslim vassals or converted Moors rather than direct rule, sparking genuine strategic debate about the merits and risks of indirect governance. The Masters raise concerns about finding reliable vassals and the risk of betrayal. Juan wisely decides to wait for Commander Martin's intelligence mission to return before making concrete plans, earning the Masters' respect for his patience. Juan then draws his sword, kisses the blade, and invokes 'Deus Vult.' Roll 91 (Transcendent Moment): All three Masters respond with immediate, full-throated conviction. Don Pedro weeps openly. Sotomayor's eyes shine. Don Luis drops his political guard entirely, grasps Juan's sword-arm, and declares he has found a king worthy of the Orders' oaths. A sacred covenant is forged.

I should narrate the Masters engaging with this new topic and let Juan guide the conversation further. Let me write a response where the Masters begin discussing Morocco, with Don Luis likely taking a more prominent role since this is closer to his expertise.\n\nSotomayor inclines his head. \"Your Majesty has answered my questions. I will not fail this trust.\" He sits, his portion of the council concluded for now.\n\nÁlvaro makes a quiet note regarding the decree.\n\nThe atmosphere shifts as the topic changes. Constantinople is distant, abstract—a city none of them have seen, an enemy they know only by reputation. Morocco is different. Morocco is visible from Castilian shores. The Moors they would fight there are cousins to the Moors they have fought for centuries.\n\nThis is familiar ground.\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán straightens in his chair, and there is a subtle change in his bearing. Constantinople was Sotomayor's moment. Morocco is Santiago's domain.\n\n\"Your Majesty raises the question that has occupied my thoughts since Granada fell,\" he says, his voice carrying new weight. \"What now? The Reconquista is complete in Iberia. But across the strait, the Moor still holds cities that were once Christian. Ceuta. Tangier. The coast that faces our own shores.\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"Santiago has studied this question for decades. My predecessors wrote memoranda on it. We have always known that finishing the work meant crossing the water.\" His eyes sharpen. \"But crossing the water changes everything. In Granada, we fought with our backs to Castile. Supply lines measured in days. Reinforcement always possible. In Morocco...\"\n\nHe shakes his head slowly.\n\n\"In Morocco, we fight with our backs to the sea. Every sack of grain, every replacement horse, every fresh soldier must come by ship. If the sea is closed to us—by weather, by enemy galleys, by simple misfortune—our garrisons starve.\"\n\nDon Pedro nods grimly. \"I have held sieges. I know what hunger does to men. A fortress can hold against assault for months. Against starvation?\" He shrugs. \"Weeks. Perhaps less.\"\n\nDon Luis continues. \"The Portuguese have learned this. They took Ceuta eighteen years ago—\" he glances at Juan, \"—Your Majesty's father-in-law led that assault himself, when he was younger. They still hold it. But holding it has cost them dearly. Constant supply runs. Garrison rotations. The Moors pressing always, always, waiting for weakness.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands on the table.\n\n\"Taking a coastal city is not the difficulty, Your Majesty. With enough ships and enough men, we can take any port on that coast. Holding it—holding it for years, for decades, for centuries—that is the challenge. That is where the Orders become essential.\"\n\nHe pauses, gathering his thoughts.\n\n\"What does Your Majesty envision? A single port, as the Portuguese hold Ceuta? Multiple cities along the coast? A true conquest, pushing inland toward Fez and Marrakesh?\"\n\nHe waits for Juan's answer, but his expression suggests he has opinions on which approach is wise—and which is folly."

          "text": "**Historical context:**\n- This is similar to some strategies used during the Reconquista - creating vassal taifa states\n- The Portuguese took Ceuta in 1415 and held it directly\n- Muslim vassal arrangements existed throughout Reconquista history (parias system, tributary relationships)\n- This reduces the burden of direct administration while maintaining influence\n\n**Advantages the Masters might see:**\n1. Reduced garrison requirements - Muslims govern themselves\n2. Local knowledge and legitimacy\n3. Lower supply burden\n4. Potential for trade relationships\n5. Buffer state model rather than direct occupation\n6. Uses the converted Muslims Juan already has (Commander Martín's network)\n\n**Concerns the Masters might raise:**\n1. Reliability of Muslim vassals - what prevents them from switching allegiance?\n2. Religious complications - can Christian Military Orders serve to protect a Muslim ruler?\n3. How do you find a Muslim willing to be a Castilian vassal?\n4. Local population's reaction to a \"traitor\" ruler\n5. Other Moroccan powers would target this vassal specifically\n6. The Orders' purpose is crusading - is protecting a Muslim ruler compatible with that?\n\n**Don Luis's likely perspective:**\nSantiago is the largest order and most politically sophisticated. He would think strategically about this. He might see merit but also significant complications.\n\n**Don Pedro's likely perspective:**\nMore straightforward soldier. Might be confused or uncomfortable with the idea of protecting Muslim rulers rather than conquering them.\n\n**Don Juan de Sotomayor:**\nJust demonstrated sophisticated strategic thinking. Might see the wisdom but also the practical challenges.\n\nThis is a genuinely novel proposal that would require thoughtful discussion. The Masters would have mixed reactions - some intrigue at the cleverness, some discomfort at the religious implications, practical questions about implementation.\n \nI recognize this proposal demands nuanced deliberation. The Masters would likely engage in a substantive dialogue, carefully weighing the strategic implications, potential risks, and innovative approach Juan is suggesting. They would probe the details, challenge assumptions, and seek a comprehensive understanding before reaching any conclusion.\n\nA long silence follows Juan's question.\n\nThe three Masters exchange glances—not the subtle political calculations of earlier, but genuine surprise. This is not what they expected.\n\nDon Pedro speaks first, his brow furrowed. \"A Muslim vassal? Your Majesty would take a city and then... give it to a Moor?\"\n\nHis tone is not hostile, merely confused. This does not fit the framework he has operated within for his entire military career.\n\nDon Luis raises a hand, forestalling further reaction from Don Pedro. The Master of Santiago's expression has shifted to something more thoughtful—the look of a man encountering an idea he has not considered before and finding it worthy of examination rather than dismissal.\n\n\"Your Majesty proposes something... unconventional,\" he says slowly. \"Let me be certain I understand. We take a coastal city—Tangier, let us say, or Asilah. Rather than garrison it with Castilian troops and Christian settlers, we install a local ruler—a Muslim—who governs as Your Majesty's vassal. He administers the city, handles the population, maintains order. And we...\"\n\nHe trails off, working through the implications.\n\n\"We establish outposts nearby. Fortified positions. Not to rule, but to protect. To ensure that when the Sultan of Fez or some tribal confederation comes to punish this vassal for his submission to a Christian king, he finds Castilian steel between him and his target.\"\n\nHe sits back, fingers drumming on the table.\n\n\"It is clever. I will grant that. It addresses the core problem—administration and supply. A Muslim vassal rules Muslims. He knows the language, the customs, the politics. He can extract taxes, maintain order, negotiate with neighbors in ways no Castilian governor ever could. And our burden becomes purely military. Outposts. Patrols. Relief forces when needed.\"\n\nDon Pedro still looks troubled. \"But the Orders exist to fight the Moor. To drive out the infidel. To plant the cross where the crescent stood. How do we explain to our knights that they are now... protecting a Muslim city? Guarding a Muslim lord?\"\n\nSotomayor, who has been listening quietly, speaks up. \"We protected Muslim lords during the Reconquista. Vassal taifas paid parias to Christian kings for generations. The Orders served kings who took that money.\" He shrugs. \"This is not so different. The goal is not to convert every soul in Morocco tomorrow. The goal is to establish Castilian power on that coast. If a Muslim vassal serves that purpose better than direct rule...\"\n\nDon Luis nods slowly, but raises a finger. \"The strategy has merit. But it rests on a foundation that may be sand.\" His eyes meet Juan's. \"Where do we find this vassal?\"\n\nHe begins to enumerate the problem.\n\n\"A Muslim lord willing to submit to a Christian king makes himself a traitor to his faith, his people, his culture. The Sultan of Fez will declare him apostate. Other lords will compete to destroy him and claim the glory.

Commander Martín converted and served faithfully—but he converted. He became Christian. His men followed him into baptism. A Muslim vassal who remains Muslim...\" Don Luis shakes his head. \"He is neither one thing nor the other. Too Christian for Morocco. Too Muslim for Castile. Who is this man? Where do we find him? And why would he accept a position that makes him a target for everyone?\"\n\nDon Pedro adds, more practically: \"And even if we find such a man—can we trust him? What prevents him from accepting our aid, establishing himself, and then betraying us the moment he feels strong enough? We would have handed him a city and then watched him close the gates against us.\"\n\nThe questions hang in the air. The Masters are not rejecting the proposal—indeed, Don Luis seems genuinely intrigued—but they are probing its weaknesses.\n\nSotomayor offers a quieter observation. \"Your Majesty mentioned informants already sent to Morocco. Commander Martín's mission.\" He pauses. \"Is this why? To find such a man? To identify someone who might accept this arrangement?\""

          "text": "The converted Moor idea is interesting - it's a middle ground. Someone who:\n- Is Christian (satisfies the Orders' religious mission)\n- Understands Muslim customs and can administer effectively\n- Can potentially be trusted more than a Muslim vassal\n- But might still face resistance from both Muslims (as apostate) and Christians (as former Moor)\n\nCommander Martín is the obvious example they all know. He's currently on the Morocco intelligence mission.\n\nThe Masters would likely engage seriously with this. Don Luis especially would want to talk about Santiago's settlement experience.\n\nI should have the Masters respond thoughtfully to this - Don Luis taking the lead since Juan mentioned Santiago's system specifically. They should:\n1. Acknowledge the converted Moor idea has merit\n2. Don Luis should explain Santiago's settlement system\n3. Raise practical questions about timeline and approach\n4. Emphasize the importance of intelligence (which Juan already has in motion)\n\nThis isn't a persuasion roll situation - this is collaborative planning. The Masters are already engaged and cooperative (within the bounds of the earlier roll of 15 - cautious acceptance). They're being consulted on their area of expertise, which they appreciate.\n\nLet me write their response.\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán leans forward, and there is a new energy in his bearing. Juan has invoked Santiago's settlement system—the Order's proudest achievement beyond mere military victory.\n\n\"Now Your Majesty speaks of something I know well,\" he says. \"Santiago has settled more frontier land than any other Order. We did not merely conquer—we transformed. Muslim villages became Christian towns. Mosques became churches. But not overnight. Never overnight.\"\n\nHe rises, beginning to pace as Sotomayor did earlier. This is his domain now.\n\n\"The system works thus: when we take territory, we do not immediately expel every Muslim. That would be foolish—we would inherit empty fields, silent workshops, dead markets. Instead, we establish authority. Christian lords, Christian law, Christian churches. But the Muslim population remains, at first. They work. They pay taxes. They see that Christian rule is not the catastrophe their imams promised.\"\n\nHe turns to face Juan.\n\n\"Then, gradually, we settle Christians among them. Farmers from Castile and León, seeking land. Merchants looking for opportunity. Priests building parishes. Over years—sometimes decades—the balance shifts. Muslims convert, or emigrate, or simply... fade. Their children grow up surrounded by Christians. Their grandchildren attend Mass.\"\n\nDon Pedro nods. \"I have seen this in Calatrava's territories. It is slow. But it works.\"\n\n\"It works,\" Don Luis agrees, \"because it is patient. And because the frontier was connected to Castile. Settlers could walk to their new homes. Priests could visit their bishops. If trouble arose, reinforcement was days away, not weeks.\"\n\nHe stops pacing, his expression growing more serious.\n\n\"Morocco is different. Settlers cannot walk across the strait. Every Christian farmer, every merchant, every priest must come by ship. The numbers will be smaller. The process slower. The isolation greater.\"\n\nHe returns to his seat, thinking aloud.\n\n\"A converted Moor as governor... yes. This has merit. He knows the people, the customs, the language. He can administer in ways a Castilian knight never could. And if he is genuinely converted—not merely performing for advantage—he has reason to want Christian success. His salvation depends on it.\"\n\nDon Pedro interjects, his practical soldier's mind at work. \"Commander Martín. He is exactly this—a converted Moor of high rank, proven in battle, trusted by Your Majesty. Is he not already in Morocco on the intelligence mission?\"\n\nSotomayor adds quietly, \"And Fernando—the former qadi. A scholar who converted genuinely, examined by cardinals in Rome. He understands the theological dimensions. How to present Christian rule to Muslim populations without provoking immediate holy war.\"\n\nDon Luis nods slowly. \"These are the men who could make such a system work. Converted Moors who believe in what they are doing, not merely opportunists seeking advantage.\" He pauses. \"But they are few. Two men cannot govern a coast. We would need more—and finding Muslims of quality who will genuinely convert, not merely mouth words for profit, is...\"\n\nHe searches for the right word.\n\n\"Rare. It happened at Granada because Your Majesty's victory was so total, so clearly divine judgment. That broke something in men like Commander Martín. They did not convert for advantage—they converted because their world had ended and they needed to understand why.\"\n\nHis eyes meet Juan's.\n\n\"Can we replicate that in Morocco? Without conquering the entire sultanate?\" He shakes his head slowly. \"I do not know. Perhaps Commander Martín's mission will tell us. Perhaps he will find men whose faith is already shaken, who are ready to hear a different truth.\"\n\nDon Pedro speaks, bringing the discussion back to concrete planning. \"Your Majesty is right that we must know carefully what we are getting into. What do we know now? Commander Martín departed—when? April? We will not hear from him until autumn at earliest. Should we wait for his report before planning further? Or begin preparations now?\"\n\nDon Luis adds: \"And what preparations? Ships? Knights? Settlers? The Order of Santiago can begin identifying families willing to emigrate—we have done this before. But we should not promise them land we have not yet taken, in cities we have not yet chosen.\"\n\nThe three Masters look to Juan, awaiting direction. The conversation has shifted from skepticism to genuine strategic planning—but they need to know how fast the King intends to move, and how much depends on intelligence they do not yet have."

They've been advocating for caution and intelligence throughout this conversation.\n\nI should narrate their agreement and perhaps have them offer some thoughts on what preliminary work could be done while waiting. Then wrap up the meeting naturally.\n\nThe three Masters nod almost in unison.\n\nDon Luis speaks first, and there is visible approval in his voice. \"Your Majesty shows wisdom that many kings lack—the patience to wait for knowledge before committing men to die.\"\n\nHe settles back in his chair, the tension of the earlier discussion fully dissipated now.\n\n\"Trade and faith. These are sound reasons for Morocco. Not mere glory-seeking or restless ambition. The pirates of the Barbary coast have plagued our shipping for generations—Castilian merchants would pay handsomely to see those nests cleared. And extending Christendom...\" he inclines his head, \"...that is what the Orders exist to do.\"\n\nDon Pedro adds, with evident relief: \"I have seen too many campaigns launched on assumption and hope. Íllora taught me what happens when we do not know what we face.\" A shadow crosses his weathered face—the memory of that failed assault still raw. \"Waiting for Commander Martín's report is not weakness. It is sense.\"\n\nSotomayor, whose mind is clearly already half in Constantinople, offers a practical observation. \"The timing may work well, Your Majesty. I depart for the East within weeks. Commander Martín's mission reports in autumn—October, November perhaps. By the time Your Majesty has digested that intelligence and reconvened this council, I will have sent my own reports from Constantinople. You will know whether the East demands more resources, or whether Castile's strength can be turned toward Morocco.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"If Constantinople is holding, if the walls are repaired and the Greeks can sustain themselves with the aid we provide—then perhaps Morocco becomes the priority for 1435. But if Constantinople is falling, if the Ottomans are massing for final assault...\" He shrugs. \"Then Your Majesty faces a different choice entirely.\"\n\nDon Luis nods gravely. \"Two fronts, thousands of miles apart. Castile is strong, but not infinite. We cannot save Constantinople and conquer Morocco simultaneously. Not without breaking ourselves.\"\n\nHe looks to Juan.\n\n\"So yes, Your Majesty. We agree. Wait for intelligence. Reconvene when we know more.\" A slight smile crosses his face—the first genuine warmth he has shown. \"In the meantime, Santiago will begin quiet preparations. Identifying potential settlers. Reviewing our records on North African ports—we have archives, maps, reports from merchants and spies accumulated over decades. When the time comes to plan, we will not start from ignorance.\"\n\nDon Pedro offers: \"Calatrava will do the same. Our fortress-builders have experience that may translate to holding coastal fortifications. I will have them study what we know of Moroccan defenses—how they build, how they assault, what works against them.\"\n\nSotomayor smiles slightly. \"Alcántara will be... otherwise occupied. But if I learn anything in Constantinople that bears on Morocco—Ottoman naval tactics, methods of holding distant outposts—I will include it in my reports.\"\n\nThe meeting has reached its natural conclusion. The Masters appear satisfied—genuinely so, not merely compliant. They have been heard, consulted, included in genuine strategic discussion. The transition from autonomous Orders to crown authority has been handled with respect for their expertise and their dignity.\n\nDon Luis rises, and the others follow.\n\n\"Your Majesty. This has been...\" he searches for the right words, \"...not what I expected when I rode to Toledo. I expected to be informed of decisions already made. Instead, I have been asked to counsel. To contribute.\" He inclines his head. \"The Orders will serve the crown faithfully. You have my word—and I believe I speak for my brothers as well.\"\n\nDon Pedro and Sotomayor nod their agreement.\n\n\"Is there anything else Your Majesty requires of us before we depart to our duties?\""

His symbolic sword gesture bridges the gap between authority and brotherhood, leveraging the deep-rooted medieval traditions of honor and collective mission. The carefully orchestrated meeting and this dramatic invitation create a powerful narrative of unity and shared destiny.\n\nThe potential response range suggests a nuanced transition from initial skepticism to emerging trust, reflecting the delicate diplomatic dance they've just navigated.\n\nANALYSIS: THE MASTERS' RESPONSE TO JUAN'S INVOCATION\n\nContext:\n\nJuan has concluded a meeting that began with significant concerns (roll: 15) but evolved through genuine consultation into something approaching partnership. He now draws his sword, kisses the blade, invokes \"Deus Vult,\" and invites the Masters to join him in this symbolic moment of unity.\n\nPsychology Assessment:\n\nPositive Factors:\n\nThe meeting genuinely went well after rocky start\n\nMasters were consulted, not dictated to\n\nTheir concerns were addressed (Alcántara charter, future consultation)\n\nSotomayor elevated with major command\n\nDon Luis explicitly acknowledged positive surprise\n\nClear purpose and missions established\n\n\"Deus Vult\" invokes their deepest identity as crusading Orders\n\nMedieval warriors respond powerfully to symbolic moments\n\nJuan has earned this gesture through the meeting's conduct\n\nPotential Hesitations:\n\nInitial reaction was cautious (roll: 15)—some wariness may linger\n\nDon Luis is political, might find theatrical gestures undignified\n\nPermanent crown control is still new reality—resentment not fully dissolved\n\nSpontaneous displays can feel forced if mood isn't right\n\nThree proud men asked to follow a king half their age\n\nIndividual Considerations:\n\nDon Pedro González de Padilla — Most likely to respond emotionally. Has wept at Juan's speeches before. If anyone joins first, it's him.\n\nDon Juan de Sotomayor — Just received major command and written charter guaranteeing his Order's survival. Goodwill is high. But he's also calculating—will watch what the senior Masters do.\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán — The key. Most senior, most political, most guarded. If he joins wholeheartedly, the others certainly follow. If he holds back, the moment falls flat.\n\nD100 TABLE: RESPONSE TO \"DEUS VULT\"\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nAwkward Hesitation — The moment falls flat. The Masters exchange uncertain glances. Don Luis's hand moves toward his sword but stops. Don Pedro looks willing but waits for the senior Master. The silence stretches. Eventually they offer muted responses, swords half-raised, voices quiet. The invocation dies in the air. Juan has misjudged the mood—the meeting went well, but not this well. Trust is building, but brotherhood cannot be rushed.\n11-25\nDutiful Compliance — The Masters draw swords and respond \"Deus Vult,\" but there is formality rather than fire in their voices. They are honoring their king, not sharing his passion. Don Luis's expression remains guarded even as he participates. The gesture is completed, but it feels like ceremony rather than transformation. Respect has been established; fervor has not.\n26-40\nMeasured Participation — Don Pedro responds first, his emotional nature overcoming hesitation. Sotomayor follows, gratitude for his new command warming his response. Don Luis joins last, his \"Deus Vult\" correct but controlled. The moment is genuine but uneven—some hearts are in it more than others. A foundation for future unity, not yet the unity itself.\n41-55\nGenuine Response — The meeting's success translates into authentic participation. Don Pedro's sword rises with evident feeling. Sotomayor's voice carries real conviction. Don Luis pauses only a moment before joining, his political caution yielding to the pull of the moment. Three voices join Juan's: \"Deus Vult!\" It is not thunderous, but it is real. Partnership has been sealed.\n56-70\nWarm Embrace — The Masters respond with genuine enthusiasm. Don Pedro draws his sword with a soldier's fierce joy. Sotomayor's voice rings clear. Even Don Luis allows something like passion to enter his response. The four swords raised together create a moment these men will remember. The transition from autonomous Orders to crown partnership has found its symbolic completion.\n71-85\nPowerful Unity — Something shifts in the room. Don Pedro draws and roars \"DEUS VULT!\" before Juan has finished speaking. Sotomayor follows instantly. Don Luis—proud, careful Don Luis—draws his blade and joins with a voice that carries decades of crusading faith. For a moment, they are not king and subordinates but brothers in arms. The political complexities fade; what remains is four warriors pledging themselves to God's work.\n86-95\nTranscendent Moment — The invocation catches fire. All three Masters respond with immediate, full-throated conviction. Don Luis's carefully maintained dignity falls away—he is not the Master of Santiago calculating advantage but a knight of Christ answering the ancient call. Sotomayor's eyes shine. Don Pedro weeps again, unashamed. The \"DEUS VULT!\" that fills the chamber could shake walls. This is not ceremony—this is covenant.\n96-100\nLegendary Brotherhood — A moment that will be remembered for generations. The four swords rise as one. The three Masters do not merely respond—they transform. Don Luis steps forward and clasps Juan's sword-arm, an gesture of brotherhood between equals that transcends the political realities. \"For three centuries, the Orders have waited for a king worthy of our oaths,\" he says, his voice rough with emotion. \"We have found him.\" The \"DEUS VULT!\" that follows is not spoken but thundered—a declaration that echoes in the souls of every man present. When they lower their swords, something permanent has been forged.\n\nBaseline Assessment: The meeting recovered well from its cautious start (15), but full transformation of attitude typically requires more time. The center of this table is around 41-55—genuine participation that reflects the meeting's success without assuming complete conversion of hearts. However, Juan has handled everything skillfully, and the symbolic moment is earned, so stronger responses are plausible.\n\nPlease roll d100."

Sotomayor's eyes shine. Don Pedro weeps again. This is covenant, not ceremony.\n\nLet me write this scene with the emotional power it deserves, while keeping it grounded in the characters we've established.\n\nTRANSCENDENT MOMENT (Roll: 91)\n\nThe steel whispers from its scabbard. Juan raises the blade, kisses it, speaks the words that have echoed across seven centuries of holy war.\n\n\"Deus Vult!\"\n\nFor a heartbeat, silence.\n\nThen Don Pedro González de Padilla moves. Not hesitantly, not with the measured caution of a subordinate responding to his king. He draws his sword in a single fluid motion—the instinct of a man who has drawn that blade a thousand times—and his voice breaks as he answers.\n\n\"DEUS VULT!\"\n\nTears stream down his weathered cheeks. He does not wipe them. He does not care. This is what Calatrava was made for. This is what he has yearned for since Granada fell and left him purposeless. A king who understands. A mission that matters. A reason to raise his sword again.\n\nSotomayor is next. The youngest Master draws his blade and steps forward, his eyes shining with something that looks like wonder. Hours ago he entered this room as the leader of the smallest Order, worried about survival, about absorption, about being forgotten. Now he leaves as commander of an expedition to Constantinople, with a royal charter guaranteeing Alcántara's future, and a king who asked his counsel and listened.\n\n\"DEUS VULT!\"\n\nHis voice cracks on the words—not from weakness, but from the weight of meaning they carry.\n\nAnd then Don Luis de Guzmán.\n\nThe Master of Santiago has maintained his composure through everything. Through the revelation of papal authority. Through the difficult questions. Through watching Sotomayor rise to unexpected prominence. He is a political creature, a man who has survived thirty years of Order politics by never showing more than he intends.\n\nBut something breaks in him now.\n\nPerhaps it is the sight of Don Pedro weeping without shame. Perhaps it is Sotomayor's shining eyes. Perhaps it is simply the accumulation of everything—the completed Reconquista, the king who returned the crusade treasury instead of keeping it, the genuine consultation where he expected mere command.\n\nPerhaps it is older than all of that. Perhaps it is the boy who took his vows sixty years ago, who knelt before the altar of Santiago and swore to fight God's enemies until his dying breath, who has spent decades watching that sacred purpose slowly drown in politics and revenue disputes and petty territorial squabbles.\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán draws his sword.\n\nThe blade rises. His arm does not tremble. But his voice—his careful, measured, political voice—breaks.\n\n\"DEUS VULT!\"\n\nThe words tear out of him with a force that surprises even himself. This is not the Master of Santiago, calculating advantage. This is Luis de Guzmán, Knight of Christ, answering the call he first answered as a boy.\n\nFour swords rise together. Four voices thunder as one.\n\n\"DEUS VULT!\"\n\nThe sound fills the chamber. It echoes off stone walls that have witnessed centuries of royal councils, but nothing quite like this. Not politics. Not negotiation. Covenant.\n\nDon Pedro is openly sobbing now, his sword still raised, his face a ruin of tears and fierce joy. Sotomayor stands straight as a lance, transformed from the cautious junior Master into something else entirely—a man who has found his purpose.\n\nAnd Don Luis—\n\nDon Luis steps forward. He reaches out with his free hand and grasps Juan's sword-arm, just above the wrist. It is a gesture of brotherhood. Of equality. The kind of touch that passes between men who have bled together.\n\n\"I have served three kings,\" he says, his voice rough, stripped of all political varnish. \"Your grandfather, who was weak. Your father, who was distracted. And you.\"\n\nHe tightens his grip.\n\n\"I did not expect to find a king worthy of the Orders. I had stopped hoping for one. I came here today prepared to manage a transition, to preserve what could be preserved, to ensure Santiago survived the loss of its independence.\"\n\nHis eyes—wet, though he would never admit it—meet Juan's.\n\n\"I was wrong. You are not ending the Orders' purpose. You are restoring it. You are giving us back what we were supposed to be, before we forgot.\"\n\nHe releases Juan's arm and steps back. But the connection remains—visible in his bearing, in the way he holds his sword, in the way he looks at his fellow Masters.\n\n\"For Santiago,\" he says. \"For Calatrava. For Alcántara. For Castile.\"\n\nDon Pedro: \"For Christ!\"\n\nSotomayor: \"For Constantinople!\"\n\nAnd all of them together, one final time, swords still raised:\n\n\"DEUS VULT!\"\n\nThe moment holds. Stretches. Becomes something that each man present will carry with him until he dies.\n\nThen, slowly, the swords lower. Don Pedro wipes his face with the back of his hand, looking slightly embarrassed but not apologetic. Sotomayor sheathes his blade with the careful reverence of a man handling something sacred. Don Luis clears his throat—once, twice—composing himself.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna, who has watched the entire scene from his seat, catches Juan's eye. The Constable's expression is unreadable to anyone who doesn't know him well. But Juan knows him well.\n\nÁlvaro is impressed.\n\nMore than that: Álvaro is moved. And Álvaro de Luna is not a man who moves easily.\n\nThe three Masters stand before Juan—no longer reluctant subordinates accepting papal decree, but brothers-in-arms bound by something older and deeper than politics.\n\nThe Military Orders belong to the crown now.\n\nBut more importantly: they want to."

And from Constantinople as soon as I am able to assess what we face.\"\n\nHe pauses at the door, looking back.\n\n\"Thank you, Your Majesty. For the charter. For the command.

His expression shifts subtly as Juan speaks—not skepticism, but the careful consideration of a man encountering an idea outside his usual domain.\n\n\"The Moors preserved Aristotle when we had forgotten him,\" he says slowly. \"Their physicians surpass ours. Their mathematicians calculate what our scholars cannot. Their astronomers map the heavens with precision we lack.\" He nods, acknowledging the truth of Juan's observation. \"I have seen what their knowledge built in Granada. The Alhambra's engineering.

Doña Beatriz hovers nearby, ready to intervene if the beetle proves dangerous or the stones too hard.\n\n\"Bug,\" Catalina announces with great authority. \"BUG.\"\n\nIsabel looks up as Juan enters the courtyard.

Don Lope suggests framing the Granada university as 'intellectual reconquest' for Church approval. They propose three complementary universities: Salamanca for law and theology, Valladolid for theology and medicine, Granada for natural philosophy and mathematics. Juan wisely narrows the scope to pure mathematics and natural science, avoiding theology. The Rectors agree on an assessment-first approach: send Arabic-reading scholars to Granada to catalogue surviving knowledge before drafting a charter.

I should:\n1. Introduce the two Rectors with appropriate historical grounding\n2. Let Juan listen first as he said he would\n3. Create an engaging scene\n\nLet me search for any relevant project knowledge about universities or these specific rectors.\n\nActually, I should just proceed with the narrative. The rectors are:\n- Don Diego de Anaya - Rector of Salamanca (the older, more prestigious university)\n- Don Lope de Barrientos - Rector of Valladolid\n\nI should also remember that Sir Thomas Beaumont is available and has been working on the Military Academy curriculum. Juan might want him involved.\n\nLet me create this scene. Juan said he wants to start by listening, which is his usual approach.\n\nTHE SCHOLARS ARRIVE\n\nJuly 9, 1433\n\nAlcázar of Toledo\n\nThe days between the Masters' departure and the Rectors' arrival pass in a gentle rhythm. Mornings with Catalina. Afternoons with Isabel. Evenings reviewing correspondence with Álvaro—the ordinary business of a kingdom that, for once, demands nothing urgent.\n\nIsabel's pregnancy progresses well. The physicians visit daily, and each day they leave with expressions of cautious optimism that slowly, gradually, shade toward genuine confidence. The baby kicks strongly. Isabel's color is good. The signs that worried them have not materialized.\n\nJuan allows himself to hope.\n\nThe Rectors arrive on the ninth of July, within hours of each other—Don Diego de Anaya of Salamanca in the morning, Don Lope de Barrientos of Valladolid by mid-afternoon.\n\nThey are a study in contrasts.\n\nDon Diego de Anaya is ancient—nearly eighty years old, a man who has outlived three kings and two popes. He moves slowly, supported by a carved walking stick, but his eyes remain sharp and his mind sharper. He has led Salamanca for over two decades, transforming it into the premier university of Castile. His white hair falls past his shoulders in the style of an earlier generation, and he wears the black robes of a scholar with the easy authority of a man who has worn nothing else for sixty years.\n\nDon Lope de Barrientos is younger—perhaps fifty—and carries himself with the energy of a man still building his legacy. Valladolid is smaller than Salamanca, newer, less prestigious, but Barrientos has ambitions for it. He is known as a theologian of considerable skill, a former confessor to Juan's father, and a man who has navigated Church politics with success. His robes are finer than Anaya's, his manner more polished.\n\nThey eye each other with the careful courtesy of professional rivals.\n\nThe Meeting\nRoyal Study, Late Afternoon\n\nJuan receives them without ceremony—no throne, no formal court. Just the study where he works, with chairs arranged to facilitate conversation rather than emphasize hierarchy. Álvaro sits nearby, ready to contribute but content to observe. Sir Thomas Beaumont has been summoned as well, standing near the window in his English soldier's practicality.\n\nThe Rectors have settled into their seats, wine poured, courtesies exchanged.\n\nDon Diego speaks first, as befits his seniority. His voice is thin with age but carries clearly.\n\n\"Your Majesty honors us with this summons. Salamanca stands ready to serve the crown, as it has for two centuries.\" He inclines his head. \"Though I confess, I am curious. Kings summon soldiers and bishops, treasurers and diplomats. It is... unusual... to summon scholars.\"\n\nDon Lope adds, more carefully: \"We received Your Majesty's letter but little explanation of its purpose. We have brought documents on our universities' finances, student enrollments, faculty appointments—whatever Your Majesty might wish to review.\"\n\nBoth men watch Juan with the guarded curiosity of academics uncertain why they have been called before power."

The Church has a complicated history with Islamic knowledge. Aquinas used Averroes, but there's also deep suspicion of Islamic learning as potentially heretical.\n\n2. **Natural Sciences** - Not heretical per se, but the emphasis on empirical inquiry over received wisdom could be controversial. The Church prefers knowledge that confirms doctrine.\n\n3. **New University in Granada** - Competition for both existing universities. Salamanca especially wouldn't want a rival.\n\n4. **\"Astrology\"** - Juan said astrology, which is different from astronomy. Astrology (predicting futures from stars) was theologically problematic. Astronomy (studying celestial movements) was more acceptable.\n \nThe admission of Muslim scholarly superiority challenges deep-seated cultural and religious prejudices. This provocative statement risks triggering defensive reactions from Christian scholars who might perceive it as a threat to their intellectual and spiritual authority. The scholars' psychological response will likely involve complex emotions of professional jealousy, theological defensiveness, and potential intellectual curiosity.\n\nThe proposal's strategic framing around combating the Ottoman threat provides a compelling religious and political justification. By presenting educational expansion as a means of strengthening Christian capabilities, Juan cleverly addresses potential resistance. The practical benefits - increased administrative expertise, potential funding, and new academic positions - offer tangible incentives that could help overcome initial skepticism.\n\nInstitutional dynamics will play a crucial role. Don Diego's conservative stance suggests he'll prioritize theological purity and institutional preservation. Don Lope's more nuanced approach indicates a careful weighing of opportunities against potential ecclesiastical disapproval. Their individual perspectives will significantly influence the university's response to this controversial proposal.\n\nANALYSIS: THE RECTORS' REACTION\n\nWhat Juan Has Proposed:\n\nSupport for universities — Unambiguously positive. More resources, royal attention, confirmation of their importance.\n\nExpansion into natural sciences, algebra, astrology, arithmetics — More complex. These subjects exist in medieval universities but are not central. Mathematics is taught, but primarily as servant to theology and law. \"Astrology\" is theologically fraught—astronomy (studying celestial movements) is acceptable, but astrology (divination from stars) has been condemned by various Church authorities.\n\nNew university in Granada learning from Muslim scholars — The most provocative element. The Church has a complicated history with Islamic knowledge. Aquinas used Averroes and Avicenna, but there's persistent suspicion of Islamic learning as potentially heretical. A new university also means competition.\n\nIndividual Psychology:\n\nDon Diego de Anaya (Salamanca):\n\n80 years old, conservative, guardian of tradition\n\nSalamanca is premier university—new competition threatens primacy\n\nHas seen reform movements come and go\n\nLikely to raise theological concerns\n\nProtective of existing curriculum and methods\n\nBut also: genuine scholar who knows Islamic contributions to learning\n\nDon Lope de Barrientos (Valladolid):\n\nYounger, ambitious, politically savvy\n\nTheologian—will be sensitive to doctrinal implications\n\nFormer royal confessor—understands how to navigate royal requests\n\nMight see opportunity in new directions\n\nBut will be cautious about Church reaction\n\nValladolid could benefit if Granada university is seen as separate category\n\nKey Sensitivities:\n\n\"They are more advanced than we are\" — Bold admission that some scholars would find uncomfortable or even offensive.\n\n\"Astrology\" — Juan may mean astronomy, but the word choice matters. Astrology as divination is condemned.\n\nLearning from Muslims — Can be framed positively (recovering knowledge, using enemy's weapons against them) or negatively (contaminating Christian learning with infidel errors).\n\nCompetition — A new university in Granada threatens both existing institutions.\n\nPositive Factors:\n\nJuan is consulting, not dictating\n\nOffering support and resources\n\nFraming around fighting Ottomans gives religious cover\n\nAcknowledges their expertise\n\nPractical emphasis (tax assessors) shows utility\n\nD100 TABLE: THE RECTORS' RESPONSE\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nAlarmed Resistance — Both Rectors react poorly. Don Diego raises sharp theological objections to learning from Muslims—\"The errors of Averroes nearly corrupted the faith once; shall we invite them again?\" Don Lope, sensing danger, distances himself from anything controversial. The mention of \"astrology\" draws immediate correction and concern. Both oppose the Granada university as unnecessary and potentially heretical. Juan has badly misjudged his audience.\n11-20\nDefensive Caution — The Rectors exchange worried glances. Don Diego lectures Juan on the proper hierarchy of knowledge—theology supreme, philosophy servant, natural sciences mere curiosities. Don Lope carefully explains why the Church might view Muslim-influenced education with suspicion. Neither directly opposes Juan, but neither offers support. They seek to delay, deflect, and protect their institutions from dangerous innovation.\n21-35\nPolite Skepticism — The Rectors receive Juan's ideas with professional courtesy but evident reservations. Don Diego acknowledges Islamic contributions to learning \"in earlier times\" but questions their relevance now. Don Lope raises practical concerns about Church approval for a Granada university. Both are willing to discuss but clearly uncomfortable with the direction. Significant persuasion will be needed.\n36-50\nCautious Engagement — The Rectors take Juan's proposals seriously while raising legitimate concerns. Don Diego corrects \"astrology\" to \"astronomy\" and explains the distinction carefully. Don Lope notes that learning from Muslim texts has precedent but must be done carefully to avoid doctrinal contamination. Both express concern about the Granada university but are willing to discuss conditions under which it might work. Constructive but guarded.\n51-65\nInterested but Careful — The Rectors engage genuinely with Juan's vision. Don Diego, despite his age, shows flickers of intellectual curiosity—he knows what Islamic scholars achieved and does not dismiss it. Don Lope sees opportunity for Valladolid in new directions. Both raise concerns (Church approval, proper theological oversight, protecting existing universities) but frame them as problems to solve rather than reasons to abandon the project.\n66-75\nThoughtful Reception — The Rectors respond with more enthusiasm than expected. Don Diego surprises by recounting Salamanca's own history of learning from translated Arabic texts. Don Lope suggests frameworks for theological oversight that could satisfy Church concerns. The Granada university idea draws interest rather than opposition—both see potential, though they want safeguards. A genuine collaborative conversation begins.\n76-85\nEnthusiastic Engagement — Juan has struck a chord. Don Diego, the old scholar, speaks with unexpected passion about knowledge lost and knowledge that might be recovered. Don Lope immediately begins strategizing how to frame this for Church approval. Both Rectors offer concrete suggestions. The competition concern fades as they recognize Juan is proposing something larger than a threat to their enrollments.\n86-95\nInspired Response — The Rectors are genuinely excited. Don Diego speaks of dreams he had as a young scholar—of a Christendom that did not merely preserve knowledge but expanded it. Don Lope sees a chance to shape something historic. Both offer not just support but active partnership. They raise concerns only to immediately propose solutions. Juan has found unexpected allies in his vision.\n96-100\nTransformative Conversation — Something remarkable happens. Don Diego, at eighty years old, speaks with the fire of a young man discovering his calling again. \"I have waited my entire life for a king who understood this,\" he says. Don Lope pledges Valladolid's full cooperation. The conversation becomes a planning session, with both Rectors contributing ideas that expand and improve Juan's initial vision. A genuine intellectual partnership is born.\n\nBaseline Assessment: Juan's proposals are genuinely controversial by 15th-century standards, touching on theological sensitivities, institutional competition, and uncomfortable admissions about Christian-Islamic intellectual relations. However, he has framed them well (fighting Ottomans, consulting rather than dictating) and is offering resources. The center is around 36-50 (Cautious Engagement)—serious scholars taking controversial ideas seriously while raising legitimate concerns.\n\nPlease roll d100."

          "text": "A silence follows Juan's words—but it is not the uncomfortable silence of men searching for polite objections. It is the silence of scholars processing something unexpected.\n\nDon Diego de Anaya moves first. The ancient Rector shifts in his chair, and something changes in his face—the guarded formality giving way to something more personal. More alive.\n\n\"Your Majesty uses the word 'astrology,'\" he says carefully. \"I assume you mean astronomia—the study of celestial movements, their mathematics, their patterns. Not astrologia judiciaria—the casting of horoscopes and reading of fates, which the Church rightly condemns.\"\n\nHe waits for Juan's confirmation, then nods slowly.\n\n\"The distinction matters. Astronomy is the queen of the mathematical sciences. It requires mastery of geometry, arithmetic, and calculation beyond what most scholars achieve.\" His thin voice strengthens as he speaks of his subject. \"And here, Your Majesty touches on a truth that few kings have understood—or wished to understand.\"\n\nHe leans forward, his ancient hands gripping the arms of his chair.\n\n\"When I was a young man—younger than Your Majesty is now—I studied the texts that came to us from Toledo's translation schools. Euclid. Ptolemy. Aristotle. All preserved by Islamic scholars when we had lost them. Al-Khwarizmi's algebra. Ibn al-Haytham's optics. Averroes's commentaries.\" He pauses. \"The very word algorithm comes from al-Khwarizmi's name. We use their knowledge every day without acknowledging its source.\"\n\nDon Lope de Barrientos stirs, clearly surprised by his elder colleague's direction. But he does not interrupt.\n\n\"Salamanca was built on recovered knowledge,\" Don Diego continues. \"We did not create Aristotle—we received him, through Arabic translations, through the work of scholars in Baghdad and Córdoba and Toledo. To pretend otherwise is vanity.\"\n\nHe fixes Juan with a sharp look.\n\n\"So when Your Majesty speaks of learning from Muslim scholars again, you do not propose something new. You propose returning to something we have abandoned. The question is not whether it can be done—it has been done. The question is whether it should be done now, and how.\"\n\nDon Lope seizes the opening, his more political mind already working.\n\n\"The theological concerns are real,\" he says. \"Not because Islamic knowledge is inherently corrupt—Aquinas himself used Averroes and Avicenna—but because it must be received carefully. Filtered. Examined for errors that might contradict doctrine.\"\n\nHe steeples his fingers.\n\n\"A university in Granada, learning from texts and scholars already present there... this could be framed as recovery. The reconquest of knowledge to match the reconquest of territory. We are not adopting Islamic learning—we are reclaiming what was Christian before it was Muslim, what was Roman before it was Christian.\"\n\nHis eyes sharpen with the look of a man who has navigated Church politics successfully.\n\n\"The Pope has blessed Your Majesty's crusade. He has granted you authority over the Military Orders. If this new university is presented as an extension of that mission—as intellectual crusade, if you will—Rome may not merely accept it. Rome may celebrate it.\"\n\nDon Diego nods slowly. \"The boy has a point. Framing matters. A university that studies Islamic texts sounds dangerous. A university that recovers ancient knowledge from infidel occupation sounds heroic.\"\n\nBoth Rectors are leaning forward now, engaged in ways they clearly did not expect to be when they entered this room.\n\n\"But there are practical concerns,\" Don Lope continues. \"Who would lead such an institution? Christian scholars who know Arabic are rare. Muslim scholars who might teach are... complicated. Would they convert? Would they be permitted to teach as Muslims? The Church would have questions.\"\n\nDon Diego adds: \"And there is the matter of existing institutions. Salamanca has taught theology and law for two centuries. If Granada begins teaching natural philosophy and mathematics as its primary purpose...\" He pauses, and something like a smile crosses his ancient face. \"Well. Competition can be healthy. But it must be structured so we strengthen each other rather than fight for the same students.\"\n\nHe looks at Don Lope, and some unspoken negotiation passes between them—old rivals recognizing that this moment is larger than their rivalry.\n\n\"Your Majesty mentioned wanting educated nobles for crown service,\" Don Diego says. \"Tax assessors. Administrators. Perhaps... a division of purpose? Salamanca continues its excellence in law and theology. Valladolid in theology and medicine. Granada becomes something new—a place for natural philosophy, mathematics, the practical sciences that Your Majesty rightly notes we must master if we are to face the Ottomans as equals.\"\n\nDon Lope nods. \"Three universities, three purposes, one kingdom. Not competing but complementing.\"\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont, who has listened silently from his position by the window, clears his throat.\n\n\"If I may, Your Majesty—\" He waits for Juan's acknowledgment. \"In England, we have Oxford and Cambridge. They compete, yes, but they also drive each other to excellence. What the Rectors propose sounds similar. And from a military perspective...\"\n\nHe steps forward.\n\n\"The Academy I am building trains officers in tactics. But tactics rest on logistics. Logistics rest on mathematics. Mathematics of supply, of siege, of artillery trajectories.\" He glances at the Rectors. \"If Granada produced men who understood these calculations—who could tell a commander exactly how much powder, at what angle, to breach a wall of specific thickness—that would be worth more than a hundred knights.\"\n\nDon Diego regards the English soldier with new interest. \"You speak of practical mathematics. Applied knowledge. This is... not how universities traditionally think. But perhaps it is how they should.\"\n\nThe conversation has transformed. What began as a royal audience has become something closer to a planning session—four minds engaging with a problem, testing ideas, building on each other's thoughts.\n\nDon Lope summarizes: \"So. Your Majesty proposes expanded education in natural sciences and mathematics. A new university in Granada focused on recovering and advancing practical knowledge. Support for existing institutions to ensure we strengthen rather than fragment Castilian learning.\"\n\nHe glances at Don Diego, who nods.\n\n\"We have concerns. Church approval must be secured—carefully, strategically. Leadership for Granada must be chosen wisely. The balance between institutions must be maintained.\" He pauses. \"But these are problems to be solved, not reasons to refuse.\"\n\nDon Diego speaks, and his voice carries the weight of eighty years of scholarship.\n\n\"I have spent my life preserving knowledge, Your Majesty. Copying manuscripts. Training students. Ensuring that what we know survives to the next generation.\" He fixes Juan with eyes that have seen much. \"But preservation is not enough. You speak of going beyond Aristotle. Of discovery. Of creating knowledge rather than merely guarding it.\"\n\nA long pause.\n\n\"I am too old to see this completed. But I am not too old to help it begin.\" He inclines his head. \"What would Your Majesty have us do?\""

Your Majesty's instinct is correct—astronomy is the proper study.\"\n\nHe exchanges a glance with Don Lope, and something passes between them—relief, perhaps, mixed with growing respect for a king who listens and adjusts.\n\nDon Lope speaks first, his political mind already working through implications.\n\n\"Avoiding theology entirely is wise. Very wise.\" He nods slowly. \"Mathematics is numbers. Natural science is observation of God's creation. Neither requires doctrinal interpretation. Neither invites accusations of heresy. A scholar studying the trajectory of a cannonball or the movement of stars is not making claims about salvation.\"\n\nHe leans forward, warming to the idea.\n\n\"The Church cannot object to arithmetic. The Church cannot condemn geometry. If Granada studies how things work rather than why God made them so—\" he spreads his hands, \"—Rome has no grounds for concern. We are simply understanding Creation more fully, which glorifies the Creator.\"\n\nDon Diego's ancient eyes have taken on a keen light.\n\n\"An assessment of what remains in Granada... yes. This should be done quickly, before more is lost.\" His voice carries sudden urgency. \"When cities fall, libraries burn. Manuscripts are used for kindling by soldiers who cannot read them. I have seen it happen. If Granada's scholars left texts behind—if there are collections we do not yet know of—\"\n\nHe turns to Juan directly.\n\n\"Your Majesty, do you know what survived? The madrasas, the libraries, the private collections of learned men? Has anyone catalogued what remains?\"\n\nSir Thomas interjects quietly: \"When the city fell, Your Majesty ordered the Alhambra preserved. But I do not know if anyone thought to preserve books.\"\n\nDon Diego makes a sound of frustration. \"Books are worth more than palaces. A palace is stone. A book is a thousand years of thought.\"\n\nDon Lope raises a calming hand. \"Then this is the first task. Send scholars to Granada—men who can read Arabic, who know what to look for. Let them assess what remains before we plan what to build.\"\n\nHe looks at Don Diego. \"Salamanca has such men. A handful. I can spare one or two from Valladolid as well.\"\n\nDon Diego nods slowly. \"I have three who might serve. Old students of mine who learned Arabic to read Averroes in the original. They are not young, but they know how to recognize valuable texts.\" He pauses. \"If Your Majesty will provide safe passage and accommodation, I will send them within the month.\"\n\nDon Lope steers back to the larger question.\n\n\"So. An assessment first. Then, based on what we find, we design the institution.\" He ticks off points on his fingers. \"A university focused on natural philosophy and mathematics. No theology—that remains with Salamanca and Valladolid. No doctrinal instruction that might draw Church scrutiny.\"\n\nHe considers further.\n\n\"We will need faculty. Some can come from our existing universities—scholars whose interests lean toward natural science but who have no outlet for them currently. They exist. They are often considered... eccentric.\" A slight smile. \"Perhaps in Granada, eccentricity becomes virtue.\"\n\nDon Diego adds: \"And some might come from the converted scholars of Granada itself. Men who knew Islamic learning but have accepted baptism. Men like—\" he pauses, searching memory, \"—Your Majesty's advisor, the former qadi. Fernando, yes? A scholar who converted genuinely, examined by Rome itself. Such men could bridge both traditions.\"\n\nHe strokes his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"A university of natural sciences, led by Christian scholars, drawing on Islamic texts and methods, producing men who understand mathematics, astronomy, optics, engineering...\" His voice has grown distant, seeing something beyond the room. \"It would be unique in Christendom. Perhaps unique in the world.\"\n\nDon Lope brings the conversation back to earth.\n\n\"There is still the question of Church approval. Even without theology, a university requires papal charter to grant degrees. Rome will ask questions.\" He holds up a hand before anyone can object. \"I am not saying it cannot be done. I am saying it must be done carefully.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan.\n\n\"Your Majesty has the Pope's ear. You have returned from Rome with unprecedented favor. If this is presented correctly—as intellectual reconquest, as preparation for crusade against the Ottomans, as glorifying God through understanding His creation—Eugenius may grant what we ask.\"\n\nDon Diego nods. \"Frame it as Your Majesty framed it to us. We must meet the Ottomans in every field. They are more advanced. We seek to amend this.\" He gives a thin smile. \"Popes understand strategic necessity. And this Pope owes Your Majesty much.\"\n\nBoth Rectors sit back, the initial shape of a plan now visible.\n\nDon Lope summarizes: \"Assessment of Granada's surviving knowledge. Design of a new institution focused on natural sciences and mathematics, avoiding theology entirely. Staffing from existing universities and converted scholars. Petition to Rome for charter, framed as extension of the crusade.\"\n\nDon Diego adds: \"And coordination with Salamanca and Valladolid, so we strengthen each other rather than compete. Granada trains mathematicians and natural philosophers. We train lawyers and theologians. The kingdom benefits from all.\"\n\nHe fixes Juan with his sharp old eyes.\n\n\"This could take years to build properly, Your Majesty. Perhaps decades. I will not live to see it completed.\" A pause, and something like peace enters his voice. \"But I would very much like to help it begin.\"\n\nDon Lope nods. \"As would I. Valladolid will contribute what it can.\"\n\nBoth Rectors wait, watching Juan, ready to hear what their king would have them do next."

The Rectors are scholars, not administrators of a conquered territory. They need royal authority to operate in Granada, which is still under military governance.\n\nLet me have them respond practically about what they need, while also perhaps raising a few other considerations they'd think of as scholars planning an expedition.\n\nDon Diego and Don Lope exchange a glance—the practiced communication of men accustomed to navigating institutional requirements.\n\nDon Lope speaks first, his administrative mind already cataloguing necessities.\n\n\"A royal letter would smooth many paths, Your Majesty. Granada is newly conquered territory under military governance. Scholars wandering through madrasas and private houses, asking questions, examining documents...\" He shrugs. \"Without clear royal authority, the Governor might view us as complications. Or worse, as spies.\"\n\nDon Diego nods. \"A letter to Don García López de Padilla—he is still Governor, yes?—instructing him to provide our scholars with access, accommodation, and cooperation. Protection too, if needed. Granada is pacified but not yet peaceful. Resentments linger.\"\n\nHe counts on gnarled fingers.\n\n\"We need three things. First, the letter of authority Your Majesty mentions. Second, funds for travel and lodging—modest, but necessary. My scholars are not wealthy men.\" A dry smile. \"Scholarship does not enrich.\"\n\n\"Third,\" Don Lope adds, \"access to those who might know where knowledge is hidden. The converted scholars. The former qadi—Fernando. Even Muslim merchants or craftsmen who might know of private collections.\" He pauses delicately. \"Books are valuable. When a city falls, valuable things disappear. Some may have been hidden, waiting for safer times. Some may have been... acquired... by soldiers who recognized their worth without understanding their contents.\"\n\nDon Diego's expression darkens at this thought. \"A proclamation might help. Offering fair payment for texts brought forward, amnesty for those who took them during the conquest. Better to buy back what was looted than lose it forever.\"\n\nSir Thomas shifts by the window. \"The army kept reasonable discipline, but no army is perfect. If manuscripts were taken as plunder, some soldiers may still have them—or may have sold them.\"\n\nDon Lope nods. \"A proclamation offering purchase rather than punishment would yield more than threats. Soldiers respond to coin.\"\n\nDon Diego summarizes: \"So. A letter of authority for the scholars. A letter to the Governor requiring cooperation. Funds for the expedition. And a proclamation offering to purchase recovered texts.\" He tilts his head. \"If Your Majesty can provide these, we can begin within the month.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then adds: \"One more thing, if Your Majesty permits. A name. Someone in Granada who can serve as guide and liaison. The former qadi Fernando would be ideal—he knows Islamic scholarly traditions, he knows what to look for, and his conversion is beyond question. Is he available?\""

Larger allocations can follow once we know the scope of what remains in Granada.\"\n\nThen he pauses, his quill hovering.\n\n\"The founding decree for the university itself... this is a larger matter, Your Majesty.

This is... not unwelcome, but perhaps we should discuss sequence.\" His voice is careful, not contradicting but advising. \"A founding decree is a permanent document. It establishes the institution in law. Once issued, it shapes everything that follows.\"\n\nDon Lope nods agreement. \"Might it be wiser to issue the decree after the assessment? Once we know what knowledge survives in Granada, we can craft the university's charter to match reality. If we find great riches in mathematics and astronomy, we emphasize those. If we find more in medicine or optics, we adjust accordingly.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"A delay of two months, perhaps three. The scholars travel to Granada, assess what remains, report their findings. Then Your Majesty issues the founding decree with full knowledge of what we are building upon.\"\n\nDon Diego adds: \"There is also the matter of Rome. A founding decree issued before papal approval risks... complications. If Eugenius grants his charter, all is well. If he hesitates or demands changes, we would need to revise a decree already issued. Better to move in parallel—seek papal approval while conducting the assessment, then issue the founding decree when both are complete.\"\n\nÁlvaro looks to Juan, awaiting direction. His expression suggests he sees merit in the Rectors' caution but will defer to the King's judgment.\n\nDon Lope offers a middle path.\n\n\"Perhaps, Your Majesty, a declaration of intent rather than a founding decree? A royal proclamation announcing that Castile will establish a university of natural sciences in Granada, with details to follow. This signals Your Majesty's commitment, begins the process with Rome, but preserves flexibility until the assessment is complete.\"\n\nDon Diego nods slowly. \"This would serve. The scholars travel with clear purpose—they are not merely investigating, they are preparing the ground for a royal institution. The Pope receives word that Castile intends great things and is invited to participate. But the precise charter awaits full knowledge.\"\n\nThere is a brief silence as both Rectors remember the earlier question left unanswered.\n\n\"And Fernando, Your Majesty?\" Don Diego asks. \"The former qadi? Would he be available to guide our scholars? His knowledge would be invaluable.\"\n\nÁlvaro answers before Juan can speak, consulting his notes. \"Fernando departed with Commander Martín's delegation to Morocco in April. He is not expected to return until October or November at the earliest.\"\n\nDon Diego's face falls slightly. \"A loss. But not insurmountable. There must be other converted scholars in Granada who might serve.\"\n\nDon Lope suggests: \"The Governor would know. Educated Muslims who converted during or after the conquest. Perhaps not of Fernando's caliber, but capable of identifying what our scholars should seek.\""

Gunnery, fortification, logistics... these are all mathematics in practice. Perhaps the Academy could send an observer with the scholars? Someone to identify texts of military application?\"\n\nDon Diego regards the English knight with that same surprised respect he showed earlier. \"A soldier who values books. You are an unusual man, Sir Thomas.\"\n\n\"I am a man who has seen what cannons do to walls built by men who did not understand mathematics,\" Sir Thomas replies simply. \"I would prefer to be on the side that calculates correctly.\"\n\nThe meeting has reached its natural conclusion. The Rectors rise, and there is a different quality to their bearing now—not the guarded formality of men uncertain why they have been summoned, but the purposeful energy of men given meaningful work.\n\nDon Diego approaches Juan and, with the privilege of age, speaks more personally.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I have advised kings before. Your father. Your grandfather, briefly, near the end.\" He pauses, choosing words with care. \"They were not bad men. But they did not see. They viewed universities as decorations—proof of civilization, useful for training lawyers, otherwise ignorable.\"\n\nHis ancient eyes meet Juan's.\n\n\"You see something different. You see that knowledge is power—not merely the power of arms, but the power to understand. To improve. To surpass.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"I did not expect to find such vision in a king who conquered Granada with swords and cannons.\"\n\nHe bows—lower than strict protocol requires.\n\n\"Salamanca will not fail you, Your Majesty. Whatever years remain to me, they are yours.\"\n\nDon Lope adds his own bow. \"Valladolid as well. We will build something worthy of Your Majesty's vision.\"\n\nThey turn to leave, but Don Diego pauses at the door.\n\n\"One more thing, Your Majesty. You spoke of meeting the Ottomans in every field. Of surpassing what we have inherited.\" His voice carries the weight of eight decades. \"That work will take generations. You may not live to see it completed. Nor will I—certainly not I.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"But if we begin it correctly... if we plant the seeds well... our grandchildren's grandchildren may look back and say: This is where it started. This is when Castile chose to reach beyond what it knew.\"\n\nHe smiles—a rare expression on that weathered face.\n\n\"That is worth more than any conquest, Your Majesty. Kingdoms fall. Knowledge endures.\"\n\nAnd then they are gone, their footsteps receding down the corridor, leaving Juan with Álvaro and Sir Thomas in a room that feels somehow larger than it did before."

Juan returns to the garden courtyard where Isabel and Catalina are spending the afternoon. Catalina is chasing a butterfly, and Isabel teases Juan about his scholarly meeting. Juan settles beside his wife and daughter for a peaceful evening as Chapter 2.10 concludes. The chapter ends with plans set in motion: Sotomayor departing for Constantinople with 300 knights and 60,000 florins, scholars heading to Granada to assess surviving knowledge, and Isabel's delivery approaching in August.",

          "text": "\"Thank you, Your Majesty. I will select someone suitable—a man who understands both scholarship and practical application.\" He pauses, considering. \"Young Captain Mendoza, perhaps. He has a head for numbers and an interest in siege engineering. The scholars may find him rough company, but he will know what to look for.\"\n\nHe bows crisply. \"With Your Majesty's leave.\"\n\nÁlvaro gathers his notes, already organizing the tasks ahead. \"I will have the documents ready for your seal tomorrow, Your Majesty. And I will coordinate with the Rectors and Sir Thomas on the expedition's requirements.\"\n\nHe hesitates at the door, something softening in his expression.\n\n\"A good day's work, Your Majesty. The Masters this morning. The Rectors this afternoon. You have bound warriors and scholars alike to your purpose.\" A rare warmth enters his voice. \"Go to your family. You have earned an evening of peace.\"\n\nThe corridors of the Alcázar are quiet in the late afternoon light. Servants move about their duties, nodding respectfully as Juan passes. The weight of the day's negotiations lifts with each step.\n\nHe finds them where he expects—in the small garden courtyard that has become their refuge.\n\nIsabel sits on the cushioned bench, her back supported by pillows, a book open in her lap though she does not seem to be reading it. Her eyes are on Catalina, who has discovered a new obsession: a butterfly.\n\nThe creature—orange and black, utterly indifferent to royal attention—flutters among the roses. Catalina follows it with the intense, wobbling determination that characterizes all her pursuits, arms outstretched as if she might catch it through sheer desire.\n\n\"Fly,\" she announces. \"Fly fly fly.\"\n\nIsabel looks up as Juan enters, and her face transforms with that smile he has come to treasure—the one that is only for him, unguarded and true.\n\n\"The conquering hero returns again,\" she says softly. \"How were the scholars? Did they weep? Did they swear eternal loyalty?\"\n\nThe echo of her earlier teasing, now a private joke between them.\n\n\"Come,\" she says, patting the bench beside her. \"Sit. Watch your daughter attempt the impossible. She has been at this for twenty minutes and shows no signs of surrender.\"\n\nCatalina, hearing her father's approach, looks up from her butterfly hunt. Her face splits into a grin.\n\n\"Pa!\" She points urgently at the butterfly, which has landed on a rose. \"Fly! Catch!\"\n\nThe evening light falls golden through the garden. The butterfly drifts lazily from flower to flower. A princess demands the impossible. A queen rests her head on her husband's shoulder.\n\nAnd for one more evening, the world asks nothing of its king but this.\n\nEND OF CHAPTER 2.10\n\nNext: The scholars depart for Granada. Isabel's delivery approaches. Commander Martín's report from Morocco. The preparations for Constantinople continue."
