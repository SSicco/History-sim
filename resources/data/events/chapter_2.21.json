      "summary": "Juan returns to Lucia's chamber at the Palazzo di San Marco before dawn after spending the night drafting reform documents with Pope Eugenius IV and Tommaso Parentucelli. He tells her everything: the papal audience, the Camera reform, the Bull of Reform with its twenty articles, and the plan for the public announcement at Mass. Lucia, pregnant and sleepless from worry, reacts with sharp political analysis and frustration at being sent to safety while Juan remains in danger. She agrees to take Catalina and her ladies to the ships at Ostia, extracting Juan's promise to return alive. Juan dictates orders for all 591 knights to attend Mass at St. Peter's in white tabards with one weapon each. Lucia departs for Ostia with the household and Juan's personal guard before dawn. Juan catches a few hours of sleep.",

          "text": "The character database is extensive. Now let me search for more recent events from Chapter 2.20 to understand exactly what's happened and where the story left off. The summary mentioned Juan should be entering Lucia's room after the night session with Eugenius and Parentucelli. Let me search for more context on the current scene.\n\nNow let me search for any additional context about where Chapter 2.20 left off and Lucia's current situation.\n\n**Current Date:** Late night, March 22, 1434 (or very early morning March 23)\n\n**Location:** Rome, specifically Juan is entering Lucia's room at the Palazzo di San Marco after spending the entire night in the Vatican with Pope Eugenius IV and Tommaso Parentucelli drafting the Camera reform documents.\n\n**What just happened in Chapter 2.20:**\n- Juan and Eugenius had their private papal audience\n- They summoned Parentucelli\n- The three men spent the entire night drafting three major documents:\n  1. Commissio Extraordinaria (Parentucelli's appointment)\n  2. Declaratio Apostolica (Motu Proprio Declaration)\n  3. Bulla Reformationis (The Bull of Reform - 20 articles restructuring the Camera)\n- They prayed together\n- Juan pledged protection\n- Everything is ready for March 23 - the public announcement\n\n**Lucia's situation:**\n- She's been at the Palazzo di San Marco, waiting\n- She's pregnant with their second child (due October 1434)\n- Catalina is with her\n- She's been frustrated by Rome's closed doors (Chapter 2.18-19)\n- She's sharp, intelligent, politically astute\n- She and Juan share everything - she knows his grand ambitions\n\n**NPC Analysis for Lucia - What does she want? What won't she say?**\n\nWhat Lucia wants:\n1. To know what happened - she's been waiting all night without word\n2. To be treated as a partner, not protected/sheltered\n3. To understand the danger they're in\n4. To have her counsel valued\n\nWhat she won't say (but is thinking):\n- She's been worried sick - a queen sitting alone while her husband negotiates with corrupt cardinals who might poison him\n- She might feel some frustration at being left behind while history is made\n\n- She's calculating potential family risks and political implications\n- Her strategic mind is already mapping out potential challenges and protective measures\n- She'll demand a comprehensive briefing, not just surface details\n\nI anticipate her immediate focus will be on understanding the full scope of Juan's negotiations, assessing potential threats, and ensuring their family's security. Her approach will be direct, analytical, and pragmatic - probing beyond Juan's likely exhausted state to extract critical strategic insights.\n\nI now have the full context. Chapter 2.20 ended with the three men having drafted and signed the reform documents through the night. Juan is now returning to Lucia's room at the Palazzo di San Marco in the early hours of March 23, 1434.\n\nMarch 23, 1434 — Just Before Dawn\nPalazzo di San Marco, Rome\n\nThe grey light before dawn seeps through the shuttered windows as the servant leads you through the quiet corridors of the palazzo. Your footsteps echo against marble floors that have heard the tread of cardinals, ambassadors, and conspirators for generations. Rome sleeps, but you carry documents that will wake her with a thunderclap.\n\nThe door to Lucia's chamber stands slightly ajar. A single candle burns within—she has been waiting.\n\nYou push the door open.\n\nLucia sits in a high-backed chair near the window, wrapped in a fur-lined robe against the March chill. Her dark hair falls loose around her shoulders—she has not slept. Her grey-green eyes, sharp as ever, track you as you enter. On the table beside her, an untouched cup of wine has grown a skin of dust.\n\nShe takes in your appearance in one long, measured look: the ink stains on your fingers, the rumpled clothing, the particular quality of exhaustion that comes from something beyond mere physical labor.\n\nShe does not rise. Does not rush to embrace you. Does not speak.\n\nInstead, she tilts her head slightly—that gesture you have come to know well. The one that says: I have been sitting here for hours imagining you dead in a Vatican cellar, and you will explain yourself thoroughly before I decide whether to be relieved or furious.\n\nA beat of silence stretches between you.\n\nThen, quietly: \"You smell of incense and old books.\" A pause. \"And something else. Fear, perhaps. Though not your own.\" Her eyes narrow fractionally. \"Whose fear have you been breathing, marito mio?\""

          "text": "What does Lucia want? What won't she say?\n- She wants to know Juan is safe - she's been worried all night\n- She wants to understand what happened - she's politically astute and has been kept in the dark\n- She wants to be treated as a partner, not just informed after the fact\n- She's pregnant and exhausted from waiting\n- She won't say how frightened she was - she's too proud\n- She won't immediately show relief - she needs to process\n- She's curious but also slightly irritated at being left waiting without information\n\nLucia is sharp-tongued, politically astute, and values partnership. She would want details, not grand proclamations. She would also have concerns about safety - if the Pope is announcing major reforms, there will be enemies.\n\nLet me write her response - she should be interested but also push back, ask questions, and not simply accept Juan's dramatic framing without wanting substance.\n\nThe kiss lands on lips that remain still for a moment—not cold, but evaluating. Then she softens, just slightly, and her hand comes up to rest against your chest. She can feel your heartbeat, still quick from the night's work.\n\nWhen you pull back, her expression has shifted. The sharp edge remains, but curiosity has joined it.\n\n\"Shake the foundations,\" she repeats slowly. She rises from the chair, moving to the window and pushing the shutter open a crack. The first pale light of dawn bleeds through. Rome sprawls below, still sleeping, unaware.\n\nShe turns back to you.\n\n\"You have been with Eugenius all night. Drafting something.\" Her mind is already working, fitting pieces together. \"The Camera reform you spoke of. You actually convinced him.\"\n\nIt is not quite a question.\n\nShe crosses her arms beneath her robe, studying you with that penetrating gaze that misses nothing.\n\n\"And Parentucelli? The scholar Eugenius summoned?\" She remembers the name from your earlier conversations. \"He is involved?\"\n\nShe moves closer, and now you can see the shadows under her eyes, the tension in her shoulders from a night of waiting and imagining the worst.\n\n\"Tell me what you have done, Juan. Not poetry—specifics.\" Her voice drops lower. \"Because if the Pope announces reform that shakes foundations, there will be men in this city who would rather see those foundations buried atop anyone who threatens them. And I have been sitting here in the dark while my husband walked into that nest of vipers.\"\n\nShe waits, one hand unconsciously moving to rest on her belly where your second child grows."

I need to have Juan explain everything from the beginning.\n\nThe user wants Juan to take Lucia to bed and tell her everything. I should narrate them settling in and then have Lucia respond to the information as Juan tells her. But I must NOT generate Juan's dialogue or actions beyond what the player has stated. So I should set the scene of them going to bed, and then... actually, the player is saying \"I tell her everything\" - this is a summary action. I can narrate the telling and then show Lucia's reaction.\n\nLet me think about what Lucia knows and doesn't know:\n- She knows Juan was going to a papal audience\n- She tried to gather intelligence beforehand (got context but no direct contacts)\n- She knows the Camera is corrupt\n- She knows about parallel legislation concept\n- She does NOT know about Parentucelli\n- She does NOT know what specifically happened in the audience\n\nWhat does Lucia want right now? What won't she say?\n- She wants to know her husband is safe and what he's gotten them into\n- She wants to understand the political implications\n- She's been terrified all night - but won't fully admit how scared she was\n- She's assessing risk to their family, especially with the pregnancy\n- She's intelligent and will grasp the implications quickly\n\nAfter hearing everything:\n- She'll understand the brilliance of the clean slate approach\n- She'll be concerned about security and cardinal reactions\n- She'll want to know the plan for tomorrow\n- She may have questions about whether this is really achievable\n- She won't want to show how frightened she's been\n\nLet me write this scene. I should describe them settling in bed, Juan telling the story (without generating his specific dialogue), and then Lucia's reaction and questions.\n\nCorrected — thank you. Lucia is pregnant with her first child, and she has not heard of Tommaso Parentucelli before.\n\nThe bed is still warm from where she had lain earlier, trying and failing to sleep. You settle against the pillows together, her body curling against yours despite the residual tension in her frame. The candle gutters low. Through the cracked shutter, Rome's rooftops catch the first grey hints of dawn.\n\nYou tell her everything.\n\nThe audience. Eugenius's initial guardedness, then the moment something cracked open when you spoke of faith—real faith, not political faith. The Pope's confession that he had lost belief in his own Church. The fear in his eyes when he spoke of the Camera, the corrupt cardinals, the Basel faction watching his every move.\n\nYou tell her about the crusade treasury—how it may already be gone, consumed by the structural deficit that devours everything Rome touches.\n\nYou tell her about the clean slate. The elegant trap: nullify all existing arrangements, transfer the obligations to the College of Cardinals, let the corrupt men fight among themselves over scraps while a reformed Camera rises lean and honest.\n\nYou tell her about the scholar summoned in the middle of the night—Tommaso Parentucelli, a man with ink-stained fingers and twenty years of quiet fury at what he had witnessed. A man who knew everything about how the corruption worked because he had watched it happen, powerless, for two decades.\n\nYou tell her about the documents signed before dawn. The Extraordinary Commission. The Motu Proprio declaration. The Bull of Reform with its twenty articles.\n\nYou tell her about the plan for tomorrow—today, now—the Mass at St. Peter's, the public announcement, Parentucelli securing the Camera building with Castilian knights before the corrupt officials can burn their records or flee with what remains of the treasury.\n\nWhen you finish, the candle has burned to a stub. Pale light fills the room.\n\nLucia is silent for a long moment. Her hand has found yours, gripping it tightly.\n\n\"Tommaso Parentucelli,\" she says finally, testing the name. \"A secretary. No family, no income, no protection. And you have made him the most dangerous man in Rome.\" She exhales slowly. \"He will need guards. Not just for today—for months. Years, perhaps. The men whose arrangements he will unravel... they will not simply accept this.\"\n\nShe shifts, propping herself up on one elbow to look at you directly.\n\n\"The cardinals. Colonna, Orsini, the French faction. They will know by noon that their world is ending. What stops them from...\" She trails off, but her meaning is clear. What stops them from killing Eugenius? From killing you?\n\nHer grey-green eyes search your face.\n\n\"You said Castilian knights will secure the Camera. How many? And what of us?\" Her hand moves unconsciously to her belly. \"What of this palazzo? What of Catalina, sleeping down the hall?\""

She agreed to partnership - \"I will NOT be a quiet wife\" she said during the proposal. Being sent to the ships while Juan remains in Rome to face the aftermath might feel like exactly what she feared - being kept safe while the real work happens without her.\n\nBut she's also pragmatic and knows she's pregnant, and Catalina is only 2 years old. The ships ARE the smart choice.\n\nLet me write this with that tension - she won't simply agree or simply refuse. She'll push back, but ultimately she's intelligent enough to see the logic.\n\nLucia's expression flickers—something passes behind her eyes too quickly to name. She pulls back slightly, sitting up against the headboard.\n\n\"To the ships,\" she repeats. Her voice is carefully neutral. \"While you remain here.\"\n\nShe looks toward the window where dawn is strengthening, painting the walls in shades of rose and gold. When she speaks again, her tone has an edge to it.\n\n\"I remember a garden in Toledo. A man kneeling before me with a ring. He said I would stand beside him in Rome and Constantinople. That I would be his partner.\" She turns back to you. \"And now Rome grows dangerous, and the partner is sent to wait on a ship while her husband walks into the fire alone.\"\n\nHer jaw tightens. For a moment, the Lucia who warned you she would argue, who promised to drive your advisors to distraction, is fully present.\n\nBut then her hand moves to her belly again. The gesture is unconscious, protective. And something in her face shifts—the sharp edge giving way to something more complicated.\n\n\"Catalina cannot be here if there is violence. That much is certain.\" She exhales slowly. \"And I...\"\n\nShe trails off, looking down at where her hand rests.\n\nWhen she looks up again, her eyes are bright with something that might be frustration, might be fear, might be both.\n\n\"I hate this,\" she says quietly. \"I hate that you are right. I hate that I cannot stand beside you tomorrow because I carry the future of your dynasty in my body and that makes me a liability instead of an ally.\"\n\nShe reaches for your hand again, gripping hard.\n\n\"Promise me something.\""

The NPC rules say she should pursue her own agenda. Her agenda here is complex - she wants both things and can't have both.\n\nLet me think about what a sharp, politically astute woman in her situation would actually do:\n\n1. She could insist on staying - but that would be putting pride over the safety of her child, which is not wise\n2. She could go willingly - but that feels like a capitulation, like becoming the \"kept safe and comfortable\" wife she feared\n3. She could extract something in return - this is most in character\n\nShe's going to go, because she's smart enough to know the risks. But she's going to make sure Juan understands what she's sacrificing, and she's going to demand something in return.\n\nI should also remember - she started to say \"Promise me something\" before Juan interrupted with \"You can come if you want.\" So she had a condition in mind.\n\nLet me write this as Lucia wrestling with the choice, then making the pragmatic decision but on her own terms.\n\nLucia is quiet for a long moment. Her fingers trace absent patterns on the bedsheet between you.\n\n\"You will not stop me,\" she says slowly. \"But you think it would be better.\"\n\nShe laughs—a short, humorless sound. \"This is how it begins, you know. The slow retreat into the women's quarters. First it is better that I wait on the ship. Then it is better that I remain in Toledo while you ride to war. Then it is better that I manage the household while the men discuss politics.\" She looks at you. \"My aunt in Ferrara. Eleven years. That is how it started for her, too. One reasonable decision at a time.\"\n\nShe pushes herself up, swinging her legs over the side of the bed. For a moment she sits with her back to you, shoulders tight.\n\n\"But I am not a fool.\" Her voice is quieter now. \"If something goes wrong today—if there is blood in the streets—I cannot run. I cannot fight. I can only be captured and used against you, or...\"\n\nShe does not finish the sentence.\n\nWhen she turns back, her face has composed itself into something harder. The Ferrarese noblewoman who survived two decades of Italian court politics.\n\n\"I will go to the ships. I will take Catalina and my ladies and I will wait like a good wife while you reshape the Church.\" The words are bitter, but controlled. \"But you will finish what you started with that promise, Juan. The one I asked for before you interrupted me.\"\n\nShe stands, pulling the robe tighter around herself.\n\n\"Promise me that when this is done—when the Camera is secured and Parentucelli has his commission and the cardinals have learned to swallow their fury—you will come back to me. Not to a ship, not to Naples. To me. Alive and whole.\"\n\nHer eyes hold yours.\n\n\"Promise me.\""

You have perhaps three hours until the sun is properly up.\"\n\nShe moves to the small writing desk in the corner of the room, where paper and ink wait. Her movements are brisk now, practical—the moment of vulnerability passed, replaced by the sharp-minded woman who survived Ferrarese court politics.\n\n\"You have 591 knights at Ostia.

Fiercely.\n\n\"Sleep,\" she says when she pulls back. \"You cannot reshape the Church if you collapse during Mass.\"\n\nThen she is gone, and you are alone with the dawn and the weight of what comes next.\n\nDo you wish to specify anything further about the Camera operation orders before sleeping, or shall we skip ahead to when you wake?"

Let me think about what he might have done and what the situation would be when Juan arrives.\n\nNPC Analysis for Pope Eugenius IV:\n- What does he want? He wants reform, but he's also terrified. He's committed now, but the night may have given him second thoughts as fear crept back.\n- What won't he say? His doubts. Any wavering. He needs to appear resolute even if he isn't.\n\nThis is a critical moment. The Pope has had hours alone since Juan left. Fear has had time to work on him. But he also signed documents - he's committed.\n\nLet me write the scene of Juan returning to the Vatican after a few hours of sleep.\n\nThe sleep is shallow and dreamless—the exhausted rest of a body that has pushed too far. You wake to find the sun well up, golden light streaming through the shutters. Someone has left bread, cheese, and watered wine on the table. Lucia is gone. So is Catalina.\n\nA servant informs you that the Queen departed for Ostia two hours ago with her household and your personal guard.\n\nYou eat quickly, wash your face, and dress in clothes suitable for Mass—no armor, but good Castilian wool in the royal colors. The bread sits heavy in your stomach.\n\nThe Vatican — Late Morning, March 23, 1434\n\nThe walk through Vatican corridors feels different in daylight. Servants and minor clergy move about their business, unaware that their world is about to crack open. You catch glances—curious, wary, speculative. Word has spread that the King of Castile spent the night with the Pope. Rome is whispering.\n\nA papal servant leads you to the same private chamber where you drafted documents by candlelight mere hours ago. The table has been cleared. Fresh candles burn. The documents themselves are nowhere to be seen.\n\nPope Eugenius IV stands at the window, gazing out at Rome. He wears his papal vestments now—the white cassock, the red shoes, the simple white zucchetto on his head. Ready for public appearance.\n\nTommaso Parentucelli sits in a corner, looking as though he has not slept at all. His eyes are red-rimmed but alert, and he clutches a leather satchel against his chest. The documents, you realize. He has not let them out of his sight.\n\nEugenius turns as you enter. His face is composed, but there are shadows beneath his eyes.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His voice is steady. \"Your knights?\"\n\n\"Assembling for Mass. They will be at St. Peter's by midday.\"\n\nA small nod. Then silence stretches.\n\nYou ask about the men for Tommaso—a handful to secure the Camera.\n\nEugenius's jaw tightens.\n\n\"Captain Pallavicini commands two hundred Vatican guards. We have... spoken with him this morning.\" The Pope's hands clasp before him. \"He is loyal. He says.\"\n\nHe says.\n\n\"We have selected twenty of his men—those Pallavicini vouches for personally. They await your Master Parentucelli's command.\" Eugenius glances toward the scholar in the corner. \"Twenty men to secure a building full of clerks who have stolen from the Church for decades. It will have to be enough until your knights can reinforce them.\"\n\nParentucelli speaks for the first time, his voice hoarse: \"Twenty is sufficient to hold the doors and prevent document destruction. If we move before anyone knows to resist.\"\n\nEugenius turns back to the window.\n\n\"The cardinals are being summoned for the Mass. They believe it is... routine. A celebration of Lent.\" His reflection in the glass looks haunted. \"Colonna. Orsini. Rochetaillée. They will all be there. Watching.\"\n\nHe is quiet for a moment.\n\n\"You spoke of a sequence last night. The Camera first. Then the announcement.\"\n\nHe turns to face you fully.\n\n\"We are ready, Your Majesty. As ready as we shall ever be.\" His voice drops. \"Tell us when.\""

But he's also frightened and uncertain about whether his own men can be trusted.\n\nWhat won't he say? He probably won't admit how little control he actually has over the Vatican Guard. He's been a weak pope, surrounded by men loyal to various factions. The fact that he had to ask Pallavicini and only got 20 men he \"vouches for personally\" suggests the rest of the 200 guards are... unreliable.\n\nLet me have Eugenius answer the question directly but show some of the uncertainty. And Parentucelli might have something to say too - he's the one who has to work with these men.\n\nI should also keep the tension high. This is a dangerous moment. The player has made good decisions but the situation is inherently risky.\n\nEugenius exchanges a glance with Parentucelli.\n\n\"They are in the guardroom adjacent to our private chapel,\" the Pope says. \"Pallavicini brought them there an hour ago, told them they had special duty for the Holy Father. They know nothing else.\" He pauses. \"Pallavicini himself waits with them. He was... not pleased to be kept ignorant of the purpose. But he obeyed.\"\n\nParentucelli shifts in his seat, clutching the satchel tighter.\n\n\"The Camera building is perhaps three hundred paces from here. A clerk's walk.\" His voice is quiet, precise. \"At this hour, there will be eight to twelve officials present. More arrive after midday, when the business of petitions begins in earnest. If we move now, we catch them at their thinnest.\"\n\nHe stands, and you see his hands are trembling slightly. Not from fear, you think—from anticipation. Twenty years of watching. Now, finally, action.\n\n\"The treasury vault is in the lower level. Two locks—the Camerlengo holds one key, the senior clerk holds the other. Neither will surrender them willingly.\" He looks at you. \"Your knights. How quickly can they reach the Camera from St. Peter's if there is... resistance?\"\n\nEugenius raises a hand.\n\n\"Before we speak of resistance—\" He turns to you fully. \"You asked where the men are. They are contained. But Captain Pallavicini will have questions when we summon him. He commands the Vatican Guard. If we exclude him from what follows, we make an enemy of a man who controls two hundred soldiers inside these walls.\"\n\nThe Pope's eyes are steady, but there is a question behind them.\n\n\"Do we bring him into our confidence?

Pallavicini should be professional, careful, and not immediately enthusiastic. He should ask pointed questions. He needs to assess whether this is going to work before he commits.\n\nEugenius holds your gaze for a long moment. Then he nods slowly.\n\n\"Trust.\" The word seems to cost him something. \"We have been Pope for three years, and We cannot recall the last time We simply... trusted.\"\n\nHe moves to the door and speaks quietly to the servant waiting outside. Footsteps recede down the corridor.\n\nThe three of you wait in silence. Parentucelli has not stopped clutching his satchel. The Pope stands motionless by the window. Somewhere in the Vatican, bells mark the hour.\n\nThen: boots on stone. A confident stride.\n\nCaptain Giacomo Pallavicini enters and drops to one knee in a single fluid motion. He is perhaps fifty, with the weathered face of a soldier and close-cropped grey hair. His eyes are dark, watchful—they sweep the room in an instant, cataloguing: the Pope, the King of Castile, the scholar with the satchel. An unusual gathering.\n\n\"Your Holiness summoned me.\"\n\n\"Rise, Captain.\"\n\nPallavicini stands. He is not a tall man, but he holds himself like someone accustomed to command. His gaze settles on you briefly—assessing, professional—then returns to the Pope.\n\n\"You have served Us faithfully these three years,\" Eugenius begins. \"You have asked no questions when We required... discretion.\"\n\n\"It is my duty, Holiness.\"\n\n\"Today We ask more than discretion.\" The Pope's voice is steady, but you can hear the effort beneath it. \"Today We ask you to choose.\"\n\nPallavicini's expression does not change, but something shifts behind his eyes. He waits.\n\nEugenius gestures toward Parentucelli. \"This man carries documents that will reform the Apostolic Camera. Root and branch. Every corrupt arrangement, every stolen florin, every deal made in shadow—ended. Today. Within the hour.\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Your twenty men will secure the Camera building,\" Eugenius continues. \"You will prevent any official from leaving, any document from being destroyed, any coin from being moved.

Then back to the Pope.\n\n\"The Camera,\" he says slowly. \"Cardinal Condulmer's office.\"\n\n\"Our nephew will be... informed. He is not the target. The clerks beneath him—the arrangements they have maintained for decades—they are the target.\"\n\nThe captain is quiet for a moment. When he speaks, his voice is careful.\n\n\"Holiness. The men who work in the Camera have friends. Patrons. Cardinals who have grown comfortable with how business is conducted.\" He pauses. \"If I secure that building, I make enemies of powerful men. Men who will remember my face long after today.\"\n\nHe is not refusing. He is asking.\n\nWhat protection do I have?"

Juan is offering concrete protection (591 knights)\n2. The Pope himself is asking - Pallavicini's direct lord\n3. Juan frames this as \"the good fight\" and \"justice\" - appeals to honor\n4. Juan acknowledges the risk openly - shows respect for Pallavicini's intelligence\n5. Juan includes himself among those at risk (\"main target\") - shared danger builds trust\n6. Pallavicini has already been loyal for three years - has track record of service\n7. Pallavicini was already selected as trustworthy by the Pope\n8. Juan offers ongoing support - \"today and tomorrow\"\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n1. Pallavicini is being asked to make powerful enemies (Colonna, Orsini, French faction)\n2. Those enemies will outlast any single king's visit to Rome\n3. Juan will leave Rome eventually - Pallavicini stays\n4. 591 knights is impressive but not permanent\n5. Juan's speech is somewhat generic - appeals to ideals without concrete personal guarantees\n6. Pallavicini doesn't know Juan well - why trust a foreign king?\n7.

Juan didn't directly answer Pallavicini's implicit question about personal protection\n\nI see Juan's speech leaves critical vulnerabilities. While passionate, it lacks specific long-term security assurances for Pallavicini. A seasoned military leader needs more than idealistic rhetoric - he requires concrete guarantees of survival and professional protection. The captain will carefully weigh these unaddressed risks before committing.\n\nPallavicini understands institutional loyalty, noting he's served the Pope for three years. Juan's offer of 591 knights provides meaningful military support, creating a nuanced negotiation landscape. The situation balances between professional calculation and potential commitment.\n\nI'll map potential response ranges, recognizing the delicate diplomatic dynamics.

Emotionally resonant but does not fully address practical long-term concerns.\n\nD100 TABLE: Pallavicini's Response\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nCold Calculation. Pallavicini's face becomes unreadable. He agrees—but something in his tone suggests he is already calculating how to hedge his position. He will follow orders today, but you cannot be certain whose side he will be on if things go badly. Trust is not established.\n11-25\nReluctant Compliance. He kneels and accepts, but first asks pointed questions: How long will Castilian knights remain? What happens when His Majesty sails east? He needs more than words. The Pope must intervene with additional assurances before Pallavicini truly commits.\n26-45\nProfessional Obedience. Pallavicini nods slowly. \"I understand, Your Majesty. Your Holiness.\" He will do his duty—but this is a soldier following orders, not a man who believes. He will secure the Camera competently, but do not expect him to take initiative or risks beyond what is strictly commanded.\n46-65\nMeasured Acceptance. Something in your words reaches him—perhaps the acknowledgment of shared danger, perhaps the simple fact that you are here, risking yourself alongside him. He straightens. \"Then we are all in God's hands together. Tell me what you need, and it will be done.\" Professional, but genuine.\n66-80\nSolid Commitment. Pallavicini meets your eyes, and you see something shift—a decision made. \"I have watched the Camera's corruption for three years, Your Majesty. I have said nothing because saying something meant death. If you offer me a chance to act...\" He draws himself up. \"My sword is yours. And my men's.\"\n81-95\nGenuine Alliance. Your words break through. Pallavicini drops to one knee again—not ritual this time, but real. \"I took this post because I believed in the Church, Majesty. I had begun to wonder if the Church I believed in still existed.\" He looks up. \"Perhaps it does. Tell me where you need me.\" He will fight for this.\n96-100\nUnexpected Gift. All of the above, and more—Pallavicini reveals something valuable. Perhaps he knows which Camera clerks are most dangerous. Perhaps he has already quietly gathered evidence of corruption, waiting for this moment. Perhaps he offers his personal savings to the cause. A true ally emerges.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

Front entrance, or through the clerks' passage on the eastern side?\"\n\nThe question is practical. Competent. There is nothing wrong with it.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nYou catch Eugenius's eye. The Pope has noticed it too—the absence of something. Pallavicini will do his duty. He will secure the building, hold the doors, follow every instruction to the letter. But there is no fire in him. No conviction. He is a professional performing a task, not a man joining a cause.\n\nIf things go badly—if the cardinals rally faster than expected, if blood is shed, if hard choices must be made—Pallavicini will not take risks.

Not a believer.\n\nParentucelli clutches his satchel and answers: \"The front entrance. We do this openly—papal authority, not skulking through back passages. They must understand from the first moment that this is sanctioned from above.\"\n\nPallavicini nods. \"As you say.\" He turns to the Pope. \"With your permission, Holiness, I will gather my men.\"\n\nEugenius raises his hand in blessing. \"Go with God, Captain.\"\n\nPallavicini bows—correctly, precisely—and withdraws.\n\nWhen the door closes, the three of you are alone again.\n\nParentucelli exhales slowly. \"He will do it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Eugenius says quietly. \"He will do it.\" The unspoken but hangs in the air.\n\nThe Pope turns to you.\n\n\"We should move. The longer we wait, the greater the chance someone notices something amiss.\" He straightens his vestments. \"Master Parentucelli—you know what must be done. His Majesty and We shall accompany you to the Camera, then proceed to St. Peter's for the Mass.\"\n\nParentucelli's knuckles are white around the satchel.\n\n\"Twenty years,\" he murmurs, half to himself. \"Twenty years of watching.\"\n\nHe moves toward the door."

Officials surrender without resistance, both treasury keys are obtained, and documents are secured.

He has names, amounts, and dates for the public announcement. The treasury is then assessed. Roll 40 (Expected Losses): The vault contains approximately 243,000 florins of the 315,500 Juan deposited in June 1433. Roughly 70,000 florins consumed in 10 months through debt service (14,000), Lateran repairs (8,000), diplomatic missions (11,000), cardinal subsidies (19,000), and administrative expenses (12,000).

Someone warned them. The building is nearly empty—key officials fled in the night with critical documents. The treasury vault stands open and bare. The corruption has escaped to fight another day, and now the cardinals know what's coming before the Mass even begins.\n6-15\nSerious Complication. Resistance. One official—connected to a powerful family—refuses to yield and calls for help. A confrontation erupts that threatens violence. Juan must intervene personally before blood is shed, or the narrative of \"reform\" becomes \"foreign king's thugs assault papal servants.\"\n16-25\nPartial Success, Major Problem. The building is secured, but the senior clerk managed to burn a stack of documents before being restrained. Smoke rises from the Camera—visible from St. Peter's. The cardinals arriving for Mass will see it and know something is wrong.\n26-40\nPartial Success, Minor Problems. Secured, but one keyholder claims he \"lost\" his key. The vault cannot be opened without breaking it down—which takes time and looks like looting rather than lawful seizure. Some records are clearly missing from where they should be.\n41-55\nAdequate Success. The Camera is secured. Officials are confused and frightened but compliant. Both keys obtained. No documents destroyed. However, the operation took longer than planned—the Mass will start late, and some cardinals are already asking questions about the delay.\n56-70\nClean Success. Textbook operation. Pallavicini's men move efficiently, Parentucelli takes command with quiet authority, officials surrender without resistance. Keys obtained, documents secured, treasury sealed. You proceed to Mass on schedule.\n71-85\nBetter Than Expected. Clean success, and Parentucelli immediately identifies irregularities—ledgers that don't match, coin counts that are wrong. He can already see the shape of the corruption. When the announcement comes, he will have specifics to present, not just accusations.\n86-95\nUnexpected Bounty. All of the above, plus a frightened junior clerk, seeing the tide turn, volunteers information—names, dates, arrangements. He wants protection in exchange. The first defector from the corrupt system delivers evidence that will make the reform case unassailable.\n96-100\nProvidence. The hand of God. Not only is everything secured perfectly, but the treasury contains more than expected—someone was about to move funds and hadn't yet completed the transfer. You have caught them mid-crime. And one of the documents Parentucelli finds is explosive: direct evidence implicating a specific cardinal in theft from the crusade fund.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

Servants and minor clergy press themselves against walls as you pass, bowing, uncertain what procession this might be.\n\nThe Camera building is unassuming. A solid Roman structure of weathered stone, unremarkable except for the papal keys carved above the doorway. The seat of the Church's finances for generations. The heart of the corruption.\n\nTwo clerks in black robes stand at the entrance, reviewing documents in the morning light. They look up at the approaching guards with mild curiosity—then see the Pope, and their faces go pale.\n\n\"Your Holiness—\" one begins.\n\n\"Stand aside.\" Eugenius's voice carries an authority you have not heard from him before. \"By Our apostolic authority, this building is now under special administration.\"\n\nThe clerks stumble backward. Pallavicini's men flow past them, through the doors, into the building beyond.\n\nInside, chaos gives way to control with surprising speed.\n\nParentucelli transforms. The trembling scholar vanishes; in his place stands a man who has memorized every corridor, every office, every hiding place in this building over twenty years of watching. He directs guards with crisp commands: \"That door—the records chamber. Two men. No one enters or leaves. You three—the vault stairway. No one descends.\"\n\nClerks emerge from offices, blinking, confused. Some protest. Most simply freeze when they see the papal vestments, the armed guards, the King of Castile standing in their corridor.\n\n\"By order of His Holiness,\" Parentucelli announces, his voice carrying through the building, \"all officials of the Apostolic Camera are to remain in place. You will surrender any keys in your possession. You will touch no documents. You will answer questions truthfully when asked.\"\n\nOne elderly clerk—the senior official, you judge from his robes—steps forward with shaking hands. \"This is... there must be some mistake. Cardinal Condulmer—\"\n\n\"The Camerlengo has been informed,\" Eugenius says coldly. \"The keys, if you please.\"\n\nThe old man's hand moves to his belt. For a moment, something flickers in his eyes—calculation, perhaps, or despair. Then he unclips a heavy iron key and surrenders it.\n\nThe second key comes from a younger official who practically throws it at Parentucelli, eager to distance himself from whatever is happening.\n\nVault secured.\n\nWhile Pallavicini's men hold positions throughout the building, Parentucelli moves to the central records chamber. You and Eugenius follow.\n\nThe room is lined with ledgers. Hundreds of them. Decades of Church finances, bound in leather, stacked on shelves reaching to the ceiling.\n\nParentucelli sets down his satchel and pulls a ledger from the nearest shelf. His eyes scan the columns—income, expenditure, dates, names. He pulls another. Then another.\n\nHis hands stop.\n\n\"Here,\" he breathes.\n\nHe lays the ledger flat on the table, pointing to a column of figures. \"This is the servitia communia—the fees for episcopal appointments. Standard rate: one-third of the first year's revenue.\" His finger traces down the page. \"But look. This diocese paid twelve hundred florins. The recorded amount is eight hundred. This one—nine hundred paid, six hundred recorded.\"\n\nHe pulls another ledger, cross-referencing rapidly.\n\n\"The difference—four hundred florins here, three hundred there—it doesn't vanish. It goes...\" He flips pages, muttering. \"There. 'Administrative expenses.' A category that did not exist fifteen years ago.\"\n\nHe looks up at Eugenius, and there is something fierce in his eyes.\n\n\"Your Holiness. In the past hour, examining only these three ledgers, I can identify at least two thousand florins in... irregularities. And these are merely the most obvious. The careful theft—the arrangements that require cross-referencing with banking records—that will take weeks to unravel.\"\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\"But I have specifics now. Names. Amounts. Dates. When you make your announcement, we do not merely accuse. We demonstrate.\"\n\nEugenius stands very still, looking at the ledgers. When he speaks, his voice is quiet.\n\n\"Twenty years, Master Parentucelli. They have been stealing from Us—from the Church—for twenty years. And We never looked.\"\n\n\"You were not meant to look, Holiness.\" Parentucelli's voice is not unkind. \"That was the system's purpose.\"\n\nThe Pope closes his eyes briefly. When he opens them, his jaw is set.\n\n\"Then let us end it.\"\n\nHe turns to you.\n\n\"The Camera is secured. The evidence is better than We dared hope. Your knights await at St. Peter's?\"\n\nThrough the window, you can see the dome of the basilica rising against the Roman sky. Bells will ring soon, calling the faithful—and the cardinals—to Mass.\n\n\"It is time, Your Majesty.\""

          "text": "1. Juan deposited 315,500 florins with full accounting for future crusades (from Chapter 2.19 summary)\n2. The Camera has a structural deficit - spending ~116,000 florins against ~100,000 in revenue\n3. External debts of ~60,000 florins to Italian banking houses\n4. Eugenius admitted he signed \"temporary transfer\" documents and doesn't know if the crusade treasury remains intact\n5. From Chapter 2.20: \"This is why the crusade treasury vanished: not because any single man stole it, but because the institution consumes faster than it receives.\"\n\nSo the crusade treasury of 315,500 florins was deposited, but it's been consumed by the structural deficit. The question is how much is left in the Camera treasury overall.\n\nGiven:\n- The structural deficit consumes funds\n- It hasn't been that long since Juan deposited (he deposited sometime earlier, and now it's March 1434)\n- The Camera has been running deficits and covering them with borrowing\n\nLet me create a d100 table that reflects the range of possibilities. The \"crusade treasury vanished\" line suggests most of it is gone, but there might be something left. The Camera itself would have some operating funds.\n\nTime elapsed: Juan deposited the money when? Looking at the timeline - he was in Rome in March 1434, and the crusade treasury was mentioned as having ~315,500 florins that he planned to return. Actually, wait - let me re-read.\n\nFrom Chapter 2.19: \"Juan deposited 315,500 florins with full accounting for future crusades.\"\n\nFrom Chapter 2.20 summary: \"This is why the crusade treasury vanished\"\n\nSo it seems Juan deposited money earlier (probably during his 1430 visit to Pope Martin V), not during this current 1434 visit. The 315,500 was deposited years ago and has since been consumed.\n \nI'm tracking the treasury's complex financial history. The papal finances reveal multiple cash infusions: Martin V's initial 20,000 florins, a substantial 440,000 florins arriving in October 1431, and by November 1432, the crusade treasury stood at approximately 235,000 florins. Juan's mission appears focused on consolidating these remaining crusade funds, potentially redirecting them toward Constantinople's defense. The Camera's own treasury remains a critical unknown, with multiple financial streams and ongoing deficits complicating the accounting.\n\nJuan's strategic deposit of 315,500 florins introduces further complexity, especially given Eugenius's uncertainty about the funds' current status. The treasury's composition now hinges on three key variables: Juan's deposit, the Camera's revenue sources, and the impact of \"temporary\" financial transfers that may have depleted the reserves.\n\nTREASURY ASSESSMENT CONTEXT\n\nBased on project files:\n\nWhat Juan Deposited:\n\n315,500 florins entrusted to the Camera for future crusades\n\nDelivered with full accounting, earmarked for crusading purposes\n\nWhat the Camera's Financial Situation Was:\n\nAnnual revenue: 100,000-150,000 florins\n\nAnnual expenses: ~116,000+ florins (structural deficit)\n\nExternal debts: ~60,000 florins to Italian banking houses (primarily Medici)\n\nEugenius admitted signing \"temporary transfer\" documents to meet \"immediate needs\"\n\nEugenius confessed: \"We do not know if your treasury is intact. We have been afraid to ask.\"\n\nTime Elapsed:\n\nDeposit made during earlier Rome visit (1430-1431 timeframe)\n\nNow March 1434—approximately 3 years of structural deficit consuming funds\n\nThe Grim Reality from Chapter 2.20:\n\n\"This is why the crusade treasury vanished: not because any single man stole it, but because the institution consumes faster than it receives.\"\n\nD100 TABLE: What Remains in the Camera Treasury?\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nBare Vault. Less than 5,000 florins remain—petty cash, essentially. The crusade treasury is entirely gone. The Camera has been operating on credit and creative accounting for months. Parentucelli's face goes grey as he counts. The reform will need to begin from nothing.\n11-25\nDregs. 15,000-25,000 florins. Enough for perhaps two months of reduced operations. Of Juan's 315,500 florins, perhaps 10,000 can be identified as \"remaining.\" The rest was consumed by \"temporary transfers\" that became permanent.\n26-40\nWorse Than Expected. 30,000-45,000 florins total. The structural deficit has consumed most of what existed. Perhaps 20,000 of Juan's deposit can be traced in the ledgers, though the actual coin is long spent. The Camera is technically solvent but barely.\n41-55\nAs Feared. 50,000-70,000 florins. Roughly what Parentucelli estimated might remain. About a third of Juan's deposit still exists in some form—the rest went to \"debt service,\" \"administrative expenses,\" and the endless hunger of the deficit. Enough to operate, not enough to thrive.\n56-70\nMarginally Better. 80,000-100,000 florins. Someone—perhaps Cardinal Condulmer, perhaps an honest clerk—protected more than expected. Half of Juan's deposit may still be identifiable. The Camera has breathing room.\n71-85\nSurprising Reserves. 120,000-150,000 florins. The corrupt officials were skimming, but they were also hoarding—keeping funds liquid for their own purposes. That hoarded money is now seized. Perhaps two-thirds of Juan's deposit remains, plus accumulated revenue.\n86-95\nHidden Wealth. 180,000-220,000 florins. The corruption was worse than imagined—but that also means more was hidden rather than spent. A locked chest in a senior clerk's office contains funds that never made it to the official ledgers. Most of Juan's deposit is recoverable.\n96-100\nProvidence. 250,000+ florins. Against all expectations, the crusade treasury was largely preserved—protected, ironically, by bureaucratic inertia and competing factions who couldn't agree on how to divide it. The Camera is not merely solvent but wealthy. Reform begins from a position of strength.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

Let me recalculate.\n\nRevised Timeline:\n\nJuan delivered ~315,500 florins to the Camera around May-June 1433 (after Te Deum in Granada, April 1433)\n\nCurrent date: March 1434\n\nTime elapsed: approximately 8-10 months\n\nRevised Calculus:\n\nStructural deficit: ~16,000 florins/year = ~10,000-13,000 florins consumed by deficit in 8-10 months\n\nBut corrupt officials also had 8-10 months to skim, divert, or \"temporarily transfer\"\n\nMuch less time for complete devastation than 3 years would allow\n\nSubstantial funds should remain unless active theft occurred\n\nREVISED D100 TABLE: What Remains in the Camera Treasury?\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nActive Theft. Less than 150,000 florins remain. Someone—or several someones—saw Juan's deposit as an opportunity and moved aggressively. \"Temporary transfers\" to banking houses, \"emergency expenses,\" payments to creditors that somehow exceeded the actual debts. Half the treasury gone in under a year. Criminal, not merely corrupt.\n11-25\nAggressive Skimming. 180,000-220,000 florins. The structural deficit consumed its share, but the real damage came from officials who accelerated their usual practices when they saw unprecedented wealth arrive. A third of Juan's deposit diverted through various schemes.\n26-40\nExpected Losses. 230,000-260,000 florins. The deficit, the debt service, the \"administrative expenses\"—all the usual mechanisms consumed what they always consume, just applied to a larger pool. Perhaps 80,000-90,000 florins gone. Disappointing but not catastrophic.\n41-55\nModerate Preservation. 270,000-290,000 florins. The crusade treasury's explicit earmarking provided some protection—even corrupt officials hesitated to openly raid funds designated for holy war. The deficit took its toll, but most remains.\n56-70\nLargely Intact. 295,000-310,000 florins. Cardinal Condulmer, whatever his limitations, took the crusade designation seriously. The treasury was kept somewhat separate from regular Camera operations. Only the unavoidable deficit and minor skimming reduced it.\n71-85\nWell Preserved. 315,000-330,000 florins. Not only is Juan's deposit largely intact, but regular Camera revenues accumulated alongside it. Someone—perhaps multiple honest clerks—actively protected the crusade funds from the usual predation.\n86-95\nBetter Than Delivered. 340,000-370,000 florins. The treasury grew. Interest from banking arrangements (usually skimmed) was actually credited. Revenue that should have gone to the general fund was quietly directed here instead. Someone was preparing for exactly this kind of reckoning.\n96-100\nProvidence. 400,000+ florins. The crusade treasury became a protected haven—honest officials quietly funneled funds here to shield them from corrupt colleagues. What was meant for theft became inadvertent savings. The Camera is wealthier than anyone realized.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

Servants press against walls. Minor clergy bow as the Pope passes. Word is spreading—something is happening—though no one yet knows what.\n\nEugenius walks with measured steps, his white vestments catching the midday light. His face has settled into what you are beginning to recognize as his public mask—serene, distant, untouchable. The frightened man who confessed to losing his faith has vanished behind the armor of office.\n\n\"The cardinals,\" he says quietly, pitching his voice for your ears alone. \"Fourteen are in Rome.

You offered to repeat your pledge publicly—your protection of the reform and those who carry it out.\"\n\nThe bells are louder now, their bronze voices rolling across Rome.\n\n\"Do you still wish to make that pledge, Your Majesty?

They stand in ordered ranks, shoulder to shoulder, the red crosses of the crusade blazing against the white cloth. Each man carries a single weapon at his belt—swords mostly, though you spot maces and axes among them. No armor. No shields. Pilgrims, not conquerors.\n\nBut pilgrims who could take Rome if they wished. Every man in the basilica knows it.\n\nAs you enter behind the Pope, a ripple passes through your knights. Hands move to sword hilts—not threat, but salute. Five hundred fists press against five hundred hearts. The sound of it echoes off ancient stone.\n\nYou raise your hand in acknowledgment as you walk the central aisle, meeting eyes where you can. Marco Tornesi, lean and weathered, standing near the front. Brother Guillem in his monk's robes with a sword incongruous at his hip. Giovanni Rossi, the former blacksmith, his fierce eyes bright with something like joy. These men crossed the sea with you. Seventy-five of their brothers died in the Mistral. The survivors stand now in the heart of Christendom, witnesses to whatever comes next.\n\n\"Majestad,\" someone murmurs as you pass. The word spreads like whispered fire. Majestad. Majestad.\n\nThe cardinals occupy the choir, arranged in their scarlet ranks like a wound against the marble. You count quickly as you take your seat at Eugenius's right hand.\n\nEleven. Perhaps twelve.\n\nCardinal Capranica catches your eye—a fractional nod. He, at least, suspects something. Cardinal Albergati, ancient and white-haired, sits with his hands folded in prayer, eyes closed. Beside him, an empty seat—Parentucelli's usual place, now conspicuously vacant.\n\nThe French faction clusters together. Cardinal Jean de Rochetaillée watches you with unconcealed suspicion, his thin face sharp as a blade. Two others lean close to him, murmuring.\n\nColonna's seat is empty. So is Orsini's.\n\nThey know, you think. Or they suspect enough to keep their distance.\n\nEugenius settles into the papal throne. His hands rest on the carved arms, perfectly still. Only someone who had spent the night with him would notice the faint tremor in his fingers.\n\nThe bells fall silent.\n\nThe Mass begins.\n\nThe liturgy unfolds in its ancient rhythms—the Introibo ad altare Dei, the Kyrie, the Gloria. Latin fills the basilica, rising to the vaulted ceiling and falling back like benediction. Your knights kneel when the congregation kneels, rise when it rises, their movements a half-beat behind the Roman clergy but earnest in their devotion.\n\nYou find your mind drifting during the readings. The weight of what comes presses against your thoughts. Lucia on a ship bound for Naples. Catalina asking where Papa went. Parentucelli in the Camera, surrounded by guards and ledgers. Two hundred and forty-three thousand florins where three hundred and fifteen thousand should be.\n\nThe Gospel reading ends.\n\nEugenius rises.\n\nThis is not the moment for a homily. This is the moment for something else entirely.\n\nThe Pope's voice carries across the hushed basilica:\n\n\"Before We continue the sacred liturgy, there is a matter of grave importance that We must address. A matter concerning the governance of Holy Mother Church herself.\"\n\nThe cardinals stir. Rochetaillée's eyes narrow.\n\n\"We call forward Our faithful servant, Tommaso Parentucelli, to attend Us.\"\n\nA side door opens. Parentucelli enters, still clutching his leather satchel, and walks the length of the nave to kneel before the papal throne.\n\nThe silence is absolute."

Something goes terribly wrong. Cardinal Rochetaillée rises mid-announcement and denounces this as Spanish tyranny—a foreign king holding the Pope hostage. Other cardinals join him. The ceremony dissolves into shouting. Some cardinals storm out, others demand Eugenius halt immediately. The documents are signed, but the moment is poisoned. By the time Juan is called to speak, the basilica feels less like sacred ground and more like a battlefield. His oath will be received as threat, not pledge.\n6-15\nHostile Reception. Eugenius delivers the announcement, but his voice wavers at key moments. The cardinals' faces harden as the scope becomes clear. When the Camera reform is read, audible protests erupt—not organized, but genuine outrage. Cardinal Rochetaillée demands to know if the Pope acts freely or under duress. The signing proceeds, but under a pall. Several cardinals ostentatiously refuse to witness, turning their backs. When Juan is called forward, the cardinal ranks radiate cold fury.\n16-25\nTense and Fractured. The announcement proceeds, but the French faction clusters together, whispering furiously throughout. When Parentucelli presents his evidence of irregularities, one cardinal laughs bitterly—\"And who appointed this clerk as our judge?\" Eugenius presses on, but momentum falters. The signing happens in strained silence. The congregation is divided—knights reverent, cardinals seething, Roman clergy uncertain. Juan is called forward into an atmosphere of brittle hostility.\n26-40\nGrudging Acceptance. Eugenius finds his voice, and the announcement unfolds with reasonable dignity. The cardinals listen in frozen silence—shock more than fury. Some faces show calculation rather than rage; they are already thinking about how to position themselves. One or two minor protests are quelled by the sheer weight of the moment. The signing proceeds. When Juan is called, the cardinals watch with guarded expressions—not welcoming, but not openly hostile. They are waiting to see what happens next.\n41-55\nSolemn Dignity. Eugenius rises to the moment. His voice steadies as he speaks of reform, of the Church's sacred mission, of the need to cleanse corruption. The Latin phrases roll forth with genuine conviction. Parentucelli presents his evidence crisply—specifics that silence potential objections. The cardinals listen, some pale, some thoughtful. Cardinal Albergati crosses himself. The signing proceeds in weighted silence. When Juan is called forward, the atmosphere is grave but not hostile—a congregation witnessing history.\n56-70\nGrowing Momentum. Something shifts as Eugenius speaks. The Pope who spent three years merely surviving begins to sound like a man who believes in what he's doing. The reforms are presented not as punishment but as liberation—the Church freed from arrangements that choked her mission. Even skeptical cardinals find themselves listening. When Parentucelli reads the amnesty provision, visible relief crosses several faces. The signing becomes almost ceremonial, proper. When Juan is called, there is genuine attention—curiosity about what the Castilian king will pledge.\n71-85\nMoment of Grace. Eugenius delivers the announcement with a conviction that surprises even you. At one point, his voice breaks slightly when speaking of the Church he loves and the corruption he allowed to fester—and that crack of genuine emotion reaches the congregation more than any rhetoric could. Several cardinals bow their heads. Cardinal Albergati weeps openly. Even Rochetaillée's expression flickers with something other than hostility. The signing proceeds with solemnity. When Juan is called forward, the basilica feels hushed, expectant—ready to witness something sacred.\n86-95\nTransformation. This is not merely an announcement—it becomes a moment of genuine spiritual power. Eugenius speaks as though the words come through him rather than from him. The reforms are framed as return to apostolic purity, as answer to prayers offered across Christendom. When Parentucelli presents his evidence, it lands not as accusation but as diagnosis—here is the sickness, here is the cure. Cardinals who entered suspicious find themselves moved. One rises and kneels, pledging support publicly. Then another. When Juan is called, the atmosphere is electric with possibility.\n96-100\nProvidence. The hand of God moves visibly in St. Peter's. As Eugenius speaks, light shifts through the high windows, illuminating the papal throne in what witnesses will later call miraculous radiance. The Pope's words carry a prophetic weight that silences all opposition. When the documents are signed, it feels less like administration and more like covenant. Cardinal Albergati rises and declares this the answer to a lifetime of prayers. Even Rochetaillée bows his head. When Juan is called forward, every soul in the basilica—knight, cardinal, clergy—understands they are witnessing a hinge of history. The oath he is about to swear will echo for generations.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

          "text": "Oh my goodness. A natural 100. This is extraordinary. The player rolled a perfect 100 on one of the most pivotal moments in the entire campaign - the public announcement of the Church reform in St. Peter's Basilica.\n\nThis needs to be written with the weight it deserves. This is a moment of genuine divine providence in the narrative - the kind of moment that defines the campaign. I need to:\n\n1. Write this with appropriate gravitas and beauty\n2. Make it feel genuinely miraculous without being cartoonish\n3. Show the transformation in the cardinals, in Eugenius, in the atmosphere\n4. Build to the moment where Juan must make his oath\n5. Stop at the right moment - just as Juan is called forward to speak\n\nThis should be one of the most memorable passages in the entire campaign. Let me craft something worthy of that natural 100.\n\nRoll: 100 — Providence\n\nThe silence after Eugenius rises stretches for a heartbeat. Two. Three.\n\nThen the Pope begins to speak.\n\n\"Fratres carissimi...\"\n\nHis voice is quiet at first—barely carrying past the first rows. But there is something in it. A quality you have not heard before. Not the frightened man who confessed to losing his faith. Not the guarded diplomat choosing words like a man crossing a minefield. Something else entirely.\n\n\"For three years, We have sat upon the throne of Peter. For three years, We have watched. We have waited. We have survived.\"\n\nHe pauses. The basilica is utterly still.\n\n\"We told Ourselves that survival was enough. That holding the Church together through crisis was sufficient labor for one pontificate. That the corruption We saw—\" his voice catches, and the crack in it is audible \"—that the corruption We allowed... was the price of unity.\"\n\nCardinal Albergati's eyes open. His ancient face turns toward the Pope with sudden, sharp attention.\n\n\"We were wrong.\"\n\nThe words fall like stones into water. Ripples spread through the cardinal ranks.\n\n\"We have been cowards.\"\n\nRochetaillée's mouth opens, then closes. No one speaks.\n\n\"The Council of Basel calls for reform, and they are right to call for it. The faithful cry out for shepherds who do not fleece them, and they are right to cry out. The King of Castile—\" Eugenius's hand extends toward you \"—crossed the sea to tell Us what We already knew and lacked the courage to speak: that the Church We love has been drowning in her own sin, and We have watched her sink rather than reach out Our hand.\"\n\nAnd then—\n\nLater, men will argue about what happened next. Some will say it was the hour, the angle of the sun, the peculiarities of Roman architecture. Others will say it was God.\n\nThe light shifts.\n\nThe high windows of St. Peter's catch the midday sun at precisely the right angle, and golden radiance pours down upon the papal throne like a river of fire. Eugenius stands haloed in light, his white vestments blazing, and the effect is so sudden and so complete that several knights drop to their knees unbidden.\n\nThe Pope does not seem to notice. Or perhaps he notices and draws strength from it. His voice rises, filling the basilica now, carrying to the farthest corners:\n\n\"Today, that ends. Today, We reach out Our hand.\"\n\nHe speaks for nearly an hour.\n\nHe presents the Basel decrees—pluralism, concubinage, annates—and explains the principle of parallel legislation. Not submission to the Council. Not defiance of it. Two authorities, moved by the same Spirit, acting independently toward the same holy ends.\n\n\"The shepherd does not ask which sheep first saw the wolf—he acts to protect the flock.\"\n\nHe presents the Camera reform. Twenty articles. Separation of Camera and College. Transparency. Abolition of compositions and corrupt arrangements. The amnesty provision—and here, you see shoulders relax among the cardinal ranks, faces that had gone grey with fear finding something like hope.\n\nHe calls Parentucelli forward.\n\nThe scholar rises from his knees, still clutching his satchel. In the golden light, he looks less like a minor secretary and more like a prophet summoned from the wilderness. His voice shakes as he begins—but steadies as he presents his evidence.\n\nNames. Amounts. Dates.\n\nNot accusations hurled in anger. Diagnosis offered in sorrow.\n\n\"Fourteen thousand florins in debt service that should have been twelve. Nineteen thousand in cardinal subsidies drawn against revenues that had not yet arrived. Twelve thousand in 'administrative expenses' that correspond to no documented expenditure.\"\n\nHe looks up at the cardinal ranks.\n\n\"This is not evil. This is sickness. A system that rewards corruption and punishes honesty. Today, the system changes. Those who embrace reform in good faith have nothing to fear. Those who continue in old ways...\"\n\nHe does not finish. He does not need to.\n\nCardinal Albergati rises.\n\nThe ancient Carthusian, seventy years old, who has lived simply his entire life while corruption swirled around him—he rises from his seat, and the movement draws every eye.\n\nHe walks forward. His steps are slow but steady.\n\nHe kneels before Eugenius.\n\n\"Your Holiness.\" His voice is thin with age but clear as a bell. \"I have prayed for this day for forty years. Forty years I have watched and grieved and wondered if God had abandoned His Church. Forty years—\"\n\nHis voice breaks. Tears stream down his weathered face.\n\n\"Forty years. And now I have lived to see it.\"\n\nHe bows his head.\n\n\"Whatever you require of me, Holiness. Whatever service these old bones can render. I am yours.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nThen another cardinal rises. You do not know his name—a younger man, Italian, his face pale but resolute. He walks forward and kneels beside Albergati.\n\nThen another.\n\nAnd another.\n\nOne by one, cardinals leave their seats and kneel before the papal throne. Not all—Rochetaillée remains seated, his face a mask of calculation, and two of his French allies stay with him. But eight cardinals kneel in the golden light, pledging themselves to reform.\n\nEven Capranica, careful Capranica who never commits until he knows which way the wind blows—even he rises, walks forward, and kneels.\n\n\"Your Holiness,\" he says quietly. \"The Church has needed this for a generation. Command us.\"\n\nEugenius looks out over the kneeling cardinals, the standing knights, the congregation of clergy and witnesses. The light still falls upon him, though it has softened now—less blinding radiance, more gentle illumination.\n\nWhen he speaks again, his voice is thick with emotion.\n\n\"We do not command. We invite. The Church is not rebuilt by decree alone—she is rebuilt by faithful hearts working together. Today, We sign these documents. Today, reform begins. But the labor of years lies ahead.\"\n\nHe gestures, and a secretary brings forward the documents. The great parchments, prepared through the night, heavy with seals and ribbons.\n\nThe Pope signs.\n\nHis hand does not tremble.\n\nParentucelli signs as witness. Cardinal Albergati, still kneeling, is helped to his feet and signs. Cardinal Capranica signs. The scratching of quills on parchment is the only sound.\n\nWhen it is done, Eugenius raises his hand in blessing over the documents. Latin words of consecration. The weight of apostolic authority settling upon ink and vellum.\n\nThen he turns.\n\nHis eyes find you.\n\n\"There remains one matter.\"\n\nThe basilica holds its breath.\n\n\"The King of Castile has pledged himself to the protection of this reform and all who labor in its service. He has offered to make this pledge publicly, before God and man, binding himself and his kingdom to the defense of Holy Mother Church in her hour of renewal.\"\n\nEugenius extends his hand toward you.\n\n\"Your Majesty. The Church calls upon you. Will you come forward?\"\n\nEvery eye turns to you.\n\nFive hundred and ninety-one knights. Eleven cardinals—eight kneeling, three watching. Scores of clergy, witnesses, servants. Tommaso Parentucelli with tears on his cheeks. Pope Eugenius IV, haloed in fading golden light, his hand outstretched.\n\nThe moment you have worked toward for four years.\n\nThe oath that cannot be unsaid."

Kings have always sought to control or influence the papacy, I offer service without expectation of recompense or gift or favor.

          "text": "The oath Juan has given is:\n1. Humble - kneeling, turning to face the crowd\n2. Principled - framing it as duty, not ambition\n3. Clear about what he's NOT asking for - no recompense, gift, or favor\n4. Establishing proper spheres - pope handles spiritual, Juan defends from worldly interference\n5. A sworn oath before God and men\n\nI need to:\n1. Describe the reaction to this oath\n2. Have the Pope respond appropriately\n3. Show the cardinals' reactions\n4. Show the knights' reactions\n5. Make this moment feel historic and earned\n6. End in a way that leaves room for what comes next\n\nGiven the roll of 100, this should be received with maximum positive impact. This is Providence - the hand of God moving visibly.\n\nI should NOT generate any further dialogue or action for Juan - just show how the world responds to what he said.\n\nThe words ring through the basilica, echoing off stone that has heard the prayers of pilgrims for a thousand years.\n\nFor a moment, nothing moves.\n\nThen Cardinal Albergati—still standing where he rose from his knees—crosses himself. His lips move in silent prayer, and fresh tears spill down his ancient face.\n\n\"Deo gratias,\" he whispers. But in the silence, it carries. \"Deo gratias.\"\n\nThe phrase spreads like fire through dry grass.\n\n\"Deo gratias.\" From the kneeling cardinals.\n\n\"Deo gratias.\" From the clergy in the congregation.\n\n\"DEO GRATIAS.\" From five hundred and ninety-one knights, the words erupting as a roar that shakes the very air. Fists strike chests. Swords clear scabbards and rise in salute—not threat, but acclamation. The crash of steel and voices fills St. Peter's until the stones themselves seem to tremble.\n\nPope Eugenius steps forward.\n\nHis hand descends upon your bowed head. The touch is light—trembling slightly—but his voice is steady as he speaks the blessing.\n\n\"Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini.\" Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n\nHe continues in Latin—the formal words of papal benediction—but when he finishes the ritual phrases, he departs from formula. His voice drops, intimate despite the crowd, pitched for you but carrying in the hushed aftermath of the knights' acclamation.\n\n\"Three days ago, We did not know if We would live to see Easter. We did not know if the Church We loved could be saved. We did not know if any Christian prince in all the world would stand beside Us rather than seek to use Us.\"\n\nHis hand tightens briefly on your head.\n\n\"Now We know.\"\n\nHe raises his voice for the congregation.\n\n\"Let all present witness: Juan II of Castile has sworn himself to the defense of Holy Mother Church. Not for land. Not for gold. Not for titles or favors or the advancement of his house. He has sworn for faith. For the belief that the Church can be what Christ intended her to be.\"\n\nEugenius raises his hand from your head and extends it to the congregation.\n\n\"This oath is received. This oath is blessed. This oath is sealed before God and all the saints. Let any man who moves against the reform of the Church know that he moves against the Crown of Castile. Let any hand raised against the servants of renewal know that it will be met by Castilian steel.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"And let all faithful Christians know that the Church is not alone. That she has defenders. That the darkness which has gathered around her will be driven back.\"\n\nThe golden light has faded now—the sun moved past whatever angle created that miraculous illumination—but it does not matter. Something else fills the basilica. Something you cannot name but can feel in your bones.\n\nCardinal Capranica rises from his knees and begins to applaud.\n\nThe sound is jarring—applause in a church, during Mass—but others take it up. Cardinals. Clergy. And then the knights, who do not clap but stamp their feet and clash their swords against their scabbards until the rhythm becomes thunder.\n\nThrough it all, Rochetaillée remains seated. His face is unreadable. His two French allies exchange glances. They do not applaud, do not stamp, do not participate.\n\nBut they do not protest either.\n\nThey are calculating. Measuring. Deciding what to tell Basel.\n\nLet them. The moment has already escaped their grasp.\n\nEugenius raises both hands, and gradually—slowly—the tumult subsides.\n\n\"The Mass continues,\" he says simply. \"Let us proceed to the Eucharist, that all present may receive the Body of Christ and be strengthened for the labors ahead.\"\n\nHe turns back toward the altar.\n\nBut as he passes you—still kneeling—he pauses. Bends close. Whispers words meant for you alone:\n\n\"We do not know what We did to deserve you, Your Majesty. But We thank God for it.\"\n\nThen he moves on, and the sacred liturgy resumes, and you rise from your knees in a basilica transformed.\n\nThe Eucharist proceeds in reverent silence. Knights file forward in orderly ranks to receive communion from the hands of cardinals who, an hour ago, did not know their world was ending. The Body of Christ, shared between reformers and those who must now choose whether to join them.\n\nWhen Mass concludes—the final blessing, the Ite, missa est—no one moves to leave.\n\nThey are waiting.\n\nWaiting to see what happens next.\n\nEugenius descends from the altar and approaches you. His public mask has softened into something more human—exhaustion, yes, but also something that might be hope.\n\n\"It is done,\" he says quietly. \"The documents are signed. The oath is sworn. The Camera is secured.\" He glances toward the doors of the basilica, where Roman sunlight streams in. \"Now we discover what Rome makes of it.\"\n\nHe looks at you.\n\n\"What would you have Us do now, Your Majesty? The cardinals will wish to speak with Us—to understand, to negotiate, to position themselves. Parentucelli awaits further instructions. And somewhere beyond these walls, Colonna and Orsini are learning what has transpired in their absence.\"\n\nThe question hangs in the air.\n\nThe oath is sworn.\n\nThe reform has begun.\n\nWhat comes next?"

The golden light has fully faded now, leaving only the ordinary illumination of candles and high windows. The Pope looks tired—deeply tired—but there is a steadiness in him that was not there yesterday.\n\n\"Stay nearby, yes. The Palazzo di San Marco, perhaps, or...\" He pauses, a flicker of concern crossing his face. \"Your Queen. Your daughter. They sailed for Naples?\"\n\n\"Ostia first, then Naples if needed.\"\n\n\"Good. Good.\" He nods slowly. \"We would not have them in danger. But We confess We would rest easier knowing you remained in Rome for... a time. Days, at least. Until We see how the cardinals settle.\"\n\nHe glances toward the scarlet ranks, where knots of conversation have begun to form. Cardinals murmuring to each other. Alliances forming, reforming, shattering.\n\n\"The discussions with the cardinals—you are right, your presence would complicate them. They must see this as Our reform, not a Spanish imposition. But knowing you are close...\" He allows himself a thin smile. \"That knowledge will concentrate minds wonderfully.\"\n\nParentucelli steps forward. He looks drained—a man who has not slept in two days and has just witnessed something he will spend a lifetime trying to understand.\n\n\"Five men, Your Majesty. Yes. Gratefully accepted.\" He clutches his satchel—still clutching it, you realize, as though it contains his own heart. \"The Camera building is secure, but the work there will take weeks. Months. I will need to interview every official, examine every ledger, trace every arrangement back to its source.\"\n\nHe hesitates.\n\n\"There is one thing.\"\n\nHis eyes move to Eugenius, then back to you.\n\n\"The letters. To the Christian monarchs—Castile, Aragón, Portugal, Naples, the Empire. His Holiness spoke of sending correspondence, informing them of the reforms, seeking their support.\" He pauses. \"They should go soon. Before... before other versions of today's events reach those courts.\"\n\nEugenius nods slowly. \"Rochetaillée will have a messenger riding for Basel within the hour. The French faction will frame this as they wish—Spanish domination, papal capitulation, whatever serves their purposes.\"\n\nHe looks at you.\n\n\"Would you assist with the letters, Your Majesty? Not write them—that must be Our hand, Our seal—but... advise? You know these monarchs. Alfonso of Aragón is your brother by marriage. João of Portugal your father-in-law. Your counsel on how to present this news would be valuable.\"\n\nParentucelli adds quietly: \"And your signature alongside His Holiness's, on the letter to Castile at least, would carry weight. Let your own kingdom hear of this from their king, not from Roman rumors.\"\n\nIn the nave, your knights have begun to organize themselves—some filing out into the Roman sunshine, others clustering near the doors in informal guard positions. Marco Tornesi catches your eye and raises an eyebrow. Orders?\n\nThe cardinals are moving too. Several approach Eugenius—Capranica first, with Albergati leaning on a younger priest's arm close behind. The French contingent withdraws toward a side chapel, heads bent together.\n\nThe day is far from over."

All cardinals present are invited to attend.\"\n\nHe glances back at you one final time.\n\n\"We will send word when We have news, Your Majesty. Pray for Us.\"\n\nThen he is gone, scarlet-robed figures clustering around him as he moves toward the side chambers. Parentucelli bows to you and hurries after—he will be needed to answer questions about the Camera's state.\n\nYou find Marco Tornesi at the nave's entrance.\n\n\"Majestad.\" His weathered face is unreadable, but his eyes are bright. \"The men are asking what happens now. Some are half-convinced they just witnessed a miracle.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Did we?\""

Cardinal Colonna - absent from Mass, powerful Roman family\n3. Cardinal Orsini - absent from Mass, powerful Roman family\n4. The Reform Cardinals (Albergati, Capranica, and others who knelt) - just pledged support\n5. Cardinal Condulmer (the Camerlengo, Pope's nephew) - his office just got restructured\n6. The Camera Officials - their world just ended\n7. The Medici Bank - major creditor, has leverage through debt arrangements\n8. Captain Pallavicini and the Vatican Guard - just chose a side\n\n**AT BASEL:**\n9. The Council of Basel / Cardinal d'Allemand's faction - will hear of this soon\n10. Cardinal Cesarini (papal legate at Basel) - moderate, will need to respond\n11. Fray Hernando and the Castilian delegation at Basel - need to know their king just did this\n\n**SECULAR RULERS:**\n12. King Alfonso V of Aragón - Juan's brother-in-law, Naples claimant\n13. King João I of Portugal - Juan's father-in-law\n14. Emperor Sigismund - Holy Roman Emperor, has his own church politics\n15. King Charles VII of France - French interests aligned with French cardinals\n16. Duke Philip of Burgundy - major power, church politics matter to him\n17. René of Anjou - rival claimant to Naples, French aligned\n\n**EASTERN:**\n18. Emperor John VIII Palaiologos (Constantinople) - waiting for Juan's crusade\n\n**ITALIAN POWERS:**\n19. Venice - major Mediterranean power, has interests in church politics\n\n20. Florence under Cosimo de' Medici - political heavyweight with complex church connections\n21. Milan's Visconti rulers - significant regional power with strategic interests\n22. Naples in political flux after Joanna II's impending death - a powder keg of potential conflict\n\n**WITHIN CASTILE:**\nI'll track the internal dynamics: Álvaro de Luna managing regency, the powerful nobility watching closely, and the lingering influence of Queen Isabel's legacy through her Portuguese connections in Toledo.\n\n**IMMEDIATE FAMILY:**\nQueen Lucia travels with Catalina, navigating these tumultuous political waters, their journey to Naples symbolizing the broader geopolitical shifts at play.\n\nPrince Fernando currently resides in Toledo, a strategic location for observing and potentially influencing emerging political developments.\n\n**OTTOMAN:**\nSultan Murad II seems detached from church internal politics, yet keenly aware of potential crusade implications that could dramatically reshape regional power dynamics.\n\nThe immediate Roman actors - from Cardinals Colonna and Orsini to the French messenger and Medici Bank representatives - will react within hours or days, creating an urgent, volatile political environment.\n\nShort-term regional players like the Basel Council, Emperor Sigismund, and various monarchs from Aragón, Portugal, and France will process information within 1-2 weeks, gradually expanding the political ripple effect.\n\nMedium-term considerations involve key regional power brokers like Álvaro de Luna, major Italian city-states, and the critical Byzantine center of Constantinople, suggesting a complex, multi-layered diplomatic landscape.\n\nFACTIONS AFFECTED BY THE REFORM ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nIMMEDIATE — ROME (will react within hours)\n\nCardinal Prospero Colonna — Absent from Mass. Powerful Roman family. Built much of the corrupt system. His arrangements are now void.\n\nCardinal Giordano Orsini — Absent from Mass. Family-first politician. Has \"informal arrangements\" with bankers that are now exposed.\n\nThe French Faction (Cardinal Rochetaillée + 2-3 allies) — Present at Mass. Already calculating. Will send messengers to Basel immediately. How do they frame this?\n\nThe Medici Bank — 60,000 florins in Camera debt. \"Informal arrangements\" with cardinals. Their leverage just became liability. Cosimo de' Medici must decide how to respond.\n\nCamera Officials (those outside the building) — Some clerks were not present when Parentucelli seized the building. They have homes, families, hidden documents. What do they do?\n\nCardinal Francesco Condulmer (Camerlengo) — The Pope's nephew. Figurehead of the office just restructured. Publicly humiliated or quietly relieved? Where does he stand?\n\nThe Reform Cardinals (Albergati, Capranica, others who knelt) — They pledged publicly. But pledges in the heat of the moment must be sustained in the cold light of political reality.\n\nCaptain Pallavicini and Vatican Guard — Professional obedience, not belief. As pressure mounts, does he hold?\n\nSHORT-TERM — CHRISTENDOM (will hear within 1-3 weeks)\n\nCouncil of Basel / Cardinal d'Allemand — The French-dominated reform faction. The Pope just adopted their reforms motu proprio while restructuring the Camera without them. Victory or insult?\n\nCardinal Cesarini (Papal Legate at Basel) — Moderate voice. Must navigate between Council and Rome. This changes everything for his position.\n\nFray Hernando and Castilian Delegation at Basel — Juan's confessor. Leading Castilian delegation. Will learn his king just reshaped the Church without consulting him.\n\nEmperor Sigismund — Holy Roman Emperor. Church politics affect Imperial politics. His letter traveled with Juan's. How does he view this?\n\nKing Alfonso V of Aragón — Brother-in-law. Naples claimant. Currently dependent on Juan's support. This changes Juan's leverage dramatically.\n\nKing João I of Portugal — Father-in-law. Aging but shrewd. His son-in-law just became the Pope's sworn protector.\n\nKing Charles VII of France — French interests aligned with French cardinals. The Rochetaillée faction serves French policy. An anti-French realignment in Rome threatens him.\n\nDuke Philip of Burgundy — Major power. Sometimes ally of France, sometimes rival. Church politics matter to Burgundian interests.\n\nMEDIUM-TERM — BROADER IMPLICATIONS\n\nÁlvaro de Luna in Castile — Regent in Juan's absence. Must manage the kingdom's reaction to news that their king has bound Castile to papal defense.\n\nVenice — Major Mediterranean power. Papal politics affect Venetian commerce and Eastern policy.\n\nFlorence (Cosimo de' Medici, political) — Beyond banking: Florentine political interests. The Medici are players, not just bankers.\n\nMilan (Visconti) — Major Italian power. Shifts in papal alignment affect the Italian balance.\n\nConstantinople (Emperor John VIII) — Waiting for Juan's crusade. A strengthened, reformed papacy might mean more Western aid—or more demands regarding Church union.\n\nSultan Murad II — Ottoman ruler. Internal Christian politics matter less than whether this produces an actual unified crusade.\n\nPERSONAL\n\nQueen Lucia — On a ship, sent away for safety. How does she receive news of what happened after she left?\n\nPrince Fernando — In Toledo with Doña Beatriz. Too young to understand, but his regents will react.\n\nWhich factions do you want to roll for first? I suggest we begin with the IMMEDIATE factions in Rome, as their reactions will shape the next hours and days. Then we can proceed to SHORT-TERM as news spreads.\n\nProposed order:\n\nColonna\n\nOrsini\n\nFrench Faction's message to Basel\n\nMedici Bank\n\nCamera Officials (scattered)\n\nCardinal Condulmer\n\nReform Cardinals' commitment\n\nPallavicini's resolve\n\nShall I draft d100 tables for each, or would you prefer to handle them differently?"

          "text": "**Cardinal Prospero Colonna - Analysis**\n\n**Who is he?**\n- Member of the powerful Colonna family, one of Rome's two dominant noble houses (the other being Orsini)\n- The Colonna and Orsini have feuded for generations and essentially control Roman politics\n- Cardinal - so a prince of the Church\n- Identified in earlier chapters as someone who \"built the corrupt system\"\n- Was absent from the Mass - he knew or suspected something was coming and chose not to be present\n\n**What is his position?**\n- His \"arrangements\" with the Camera are now void under the new reform\n- The amnesty provision protects him from prosecution for past practices IF he \"embraces reform in good faith\"\n- He was not present to kneel with the other cardinals - he has not publicly committed either way\n- His absence could be read as opposition, or as prudent caution\n- He has significant wealth, influence, and family power\n\n**What are his capabilities?**\n- The Colonna family has armed retainers, estates, fortified positions in and around Rome\n- They have deep networks in Roman politics, the papal court, Italian politics broadly\n- They have banking relationships and wealth\n- They can influence other cardinals, especially those who benefited from the old system\n- They could potentially organize opposition - political, not necessarily military (yet)\n- They have connections to other Italian powers (Naples, Milan, etc.)\n- They could flee Rome and work against the Pope from outside\n- They could submit and try to work within the new system to protect their interests\n\n**What are his realistic options?**\n\n1. **Submit and cooperate** - Accept the amnesty, embrace reform publicly, try to position himself favorably in the new order. Lose immediate power but survive.\n\n2. **Wait and see** - A strategic pause to assess the political landscape. He'll observe how other cardinals react, gather intelligence, and minimize personal risk. This approach allows him to maintain flexibility while avoiding immediate commitment.\n\n3. **Quiet opposition** - Subtly undermining reforms through private networks. He'll cultivate alliances with disaffected cardinals, using his family's extensive political connections to create a potential counter-movement without direct confrontation.\n\n4. **Open opposition** - Leveraging his family's influence to challenge the Pope's authority. He might invoke canonical procedures, appeal to external powers, and frame the reforms as illegitimate, potentially drawing on support from traditional ecclesiastical institutions.\n\n5. **Flight** - A last resort option involving strategic withdrawal. By leaving Rome, he could preserve his options, potentially seeking refuge in Basel or France, where he might continue to work against the reforms from a position of relative safety.\n\nContinuing to the next thinking, he would complete his strategic retreat by seeking refuge in a Colonna family stronghold, establishing a secure base from which to maneuver politically.\n\nThe option of violence is virtually unthinkable. Cardinals understood the delicate political ecosystem of Rome, where open armed resistance would destroy all credibility and potentially unite opponents against him. His survival depended on nuanced political maneuvering, not brute force.\n\nAn alliance with the Orsini, traditionally his family's rivals, represents an extraordinary potential strategy. Such an unprecedented move could signal the gravity of the political transformation and his willingness to break long-standing feuds to protect his interests.\n\nKey strategic calculations drive his thinking: understanding the Pope's actual strength, anticipating potential shifts in power, and determining whether resistance or compliance offers the best long-term advantage. His decades of political experience would guide him to choose the path of least potential destruction.\n\nThe presence of 591 Castilian knights fundamentally alters his immediate options, making open opposition in Rome completely untenable. His most prudent approach involves minimal compliance, strategic waiting, and carefully observing whether the reform coalition might naturally fracture.\n\nPotential alliances emerge as critical considerations: the Orsini, French factions, affected cardinals, the Medici, Neapolitan claimants, and Milanese powers all represent possible strategic partnerships. Each alliance carries complex risks and potential rewards.\n\nHis response will likely fall into three potential scenarios: a rash, self-destructive reaction; a cautious, calculated waiting game; or a clever, positioning maneuver that preserves his political capital.\n\nFACTION 1: Cardinal Prospero Colonna\n\nWHO HE IS:\n\nMember of the Colonna family, one of Rome's two dominant noble houses (rivals: Orsini)\n\nSenior cardinal with decades of curial experience\n\nIdentified by Eugenius as someone who \"built the corrupt system\"\n\nAbsent from today's Mass—he knew or suspected something and chose distance\n\nHIS POSITION:\n\nHis \"arrangements\" with the Camera are now legally void\n\nThe amnesty provision protects him from prosecution IF he \"embraces reform in good faith\"\n\nHe did not kneel with the other cardinals—he has made no public commitment\n\nHis absence can be read as opposition, prudence, or plausible deniability\n\nHe has significant wealth, family power, and Roman influence\n\nHIS CAPABILITIES:\n\nArmed Colonna retainers and fortified positions in and around Rome\n\nDeep networks in Roman politics, the Curia, and Italian courts\n\nBanking relationships and accumulated wealth\n\nInfluence over other cardinals who benefited from the old system\n\nConnections to Italian powers (Naples, Milan, other noble families)\n\nCould organize political opposition, appeal to Basel, invoke canonical procedures\n\nCould flee Rome and work against the Pope from safety\n\nHIS REALISTIC OPTIONS:\n\nSubmit and cooperate — Accept amnesty, embrace reform publicly, try to position himself in the new order. Survive but diminished.\n\nWait and calculate — Neither openly oppose nor support. Gather information. Let others take risks first. Classic Roman politics.\n\nQuiet undermining — Public compliance, private obstruction. Coordinate with other affected cardinals. Build coalition for eventual counter-action.\n\nOpen opposition — Denounce reforms as illegitimate Spanish coercion. Appeal to Basel, to France, to canonical law. Risky but potentially powerful if others join.\n\nFlight — Leave Rome for Colonna strongholds or Basel. Work against the Pope from safety. Abandons Roman position but preserves freedom.\n\nSeek alliance with Orsini — Traditional rivals united by common threat. Dramatic, unusual, potentially powerful.\n\nViolence/assassination — Extremely unlikely. Would unite all against Colonna. Political suicide. Not how Roman cardinals operate.\n\nKEY CALCULATION:\nColonna is a survivor. He has 591 Castilian knights to consider. Open opposition NOW is suicidal. But if the reform coalition fractures, early opponents become heroes. The question: does he believe Eugenius can sustain this?\n\nD100 TABLE: Cardinal Colonna's Reaction\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCatastrophic misjudgment. Colonna panics. He attempts to flee Rome immediately with family documents and portable wealth, but his hasty departure is noticed. Pallavicini's guards, alert for exactly this, intercept his household at the gates. Colonna himself escapes, but his papers do not. Parentucelli now has Colonna's private correspondence—potentially explosive evidence of specific arrangements. Colonna becomes a fugitive, his Roman position destroyed.\n6-15\nOpen defiance. Colonna issues a public statement denouncing the reforms as illegitimate—the Pope acting under Spanish duress, canonical procedures violated, the College of Cardinals bypassed. He demands an emergency consistory and appeals to Basel. This is bold but isolating. Other cardinals, even sympathetic ones, distance themselves from such open rebellion while Castilian knights fill Rome. Colonna has made himself the face of opposition—a target.\n16-25\nFlight to safety. Colonna quietly departs Rome within hours, traveling to Colonna family strongholds in the Campagna. He sends measured letters—not denouncing the Pope, but expressing \"concerns\" and \"need for reflection.\" He positions himself outside Rome but not openly opposed. Safe, but absent from the political arena where decisions will be made. His Roman influence bleeds away daily.\n26-35\nBitter compliance. Colonna submits a terse letter accepting the amnesty and pledging cooperation \"in accordance with canonical tradition.\" The words are technically correct but the tone is unmistakable. He attends no meetings, offers no assistance, answers questions minimally. He is complying with the letter of the reform while making clear he considers it illegitimate. Sullen, resentful, waiting for the Pope to falter.\n36-50\nCalculating silence. Colonna does nothing. No statement, no flight, no submission. He remains in his Roman palazzo, receives visitors, gathers information. He is watching—who commits to reform, who hesitates, where the fractures might appear. He will not be the first to move. Classic Roman politics: let others take risks, then exploit the results. The reform proceeds without his opposition but also without his cooperation.\n51-65\nGrudging accommodation. After a day of calculation, Colonna sends a carefully worded letter accepting the amnesty and expressing \"support for His Holiness's pastoral intentions.\" He requests a private audience to discuss \"how the great families of Rome might assist in this sacred work.\" He is positioning himself not as opponent but as necessary partner—someone who knows how Rome actually works and must be consulted. Trying to preserve influence within the new system.\n66-75\nStrategic submission. Colonna appears at the Vatican the following morning, requests an audience, and publicly kneels before Eugenius. His submission is graceful, even eloquent—praising the Pope's courage, accepting the amnesty with apparent gratitude, offering the Colonna family's resources for \"the defense of Holy Mother Church in this time of renewal.\" It is performance, certainly. But it is good performance. He positions himself as reformed sinner, not defeated enemy.\n76-85\nGenuine recalculation. Something about today's events—the light in St. Peter's, the cardinals kneeling, the raw power of the moment—shakes Colonna more than he expected. He is not converted, not truly. But he recognizes that the ground has shifted beneath Roman politics. His letter of submission contains a surprising offer: specific information about Camera arrangements he personally knows, provided confidentially to Parentucelli. He is buying goodwill with intelligence. Potentially very valuable.\n86-95\nUnexpected cooperation. Colonna requests an urgent private meeting with the Pope. When granted, he provides something genuinely useful: warning about which cardinals are likely to cause trouble, which Camera officials have hidden documents in private locations, which banking arrangements are most vulnerable to exposure. He is betraying his former allies to secure his position in the new order. Self-interested, but the information is real. The reform gains actionable intelligence.\n96-100\nTransformation. The impossible happens. Cardinal Colonna, architect of corruption, experiences something in the aftermath of today's events—perhaps the realization of mortality, perhaps genuine spiritual crisis, perhaps simply the cold recognition that his life's work is ashes. He requests confession. He provides Parentucelli with comprehensive documentation of Camera corruption—names, amounts, arrangements—including his own involvement. He asks only that the information be used for reform, not persecution. Whether sincere conversion or ultimate political calculation, the effect is the same: the reform gains its most valuable witness.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

He sends measured letters—not denouncing the Pope, but expressing \"concerns\" and \"need for reflection.\" He positions himself outside Rome but not openly opposed. Safe, but absent from the political arena where decisions will be made. His Roman influence bleeds away daily.\n\nFACTION 2: Cardinal Giordano Orsini\n\nWHO HE IS:\n\nMember of the Orsini family, the other dominant Roman noble house (rivals: Colonna)\n\nWas Pope Martin V's closest advisor—spoke fluent Castilian, interviewed Juan before his first papal audience in 1430\n\nEugenius described him as \"family first, Church second, Pope a distant third\"\n\nAlso absent from today's Mass—like Colonna, he anticipated something\n\nFray Hernando's recent visit to him was met with \"polite but distant\" reception (Roll: 17)—he was already distancing himself\n\nHIS POSITION:\n\nHas \"informal arrangements\" with Italian bankers now exposed\n\nThe amnesty protects him IF he cooperates\n\nHe knew Juan personally from 1430—assessed Juan's spiritual state, facilitated the original crusade bull\n\nHis absence today, like Colonna's, leaves him uncommitted\n\nTraditional Orsini-Colonna rivalry complicates any joint response\n\nHe has just watched his ancient rival Colonna flee Rome—this affects his calculation\n\nHIS CAPABILITIES:\n\nArmed Orsini retainers, fortified positions, Roman territorial control\n\nDeep Vatican networks from decades of service\n\nRelationship with Martin V's legacy—some cardinals appointed under Martin remain loyal to his memory and to Orsini\n\nBanking relationships (likely Medici connections)\n\nKnowledge of Juan personally—understands who he is dealing with\n\nCould organize opposition, appeal to Basel, invoke canonical procedures\n\nItalian diplomatic connections (though not as extensive as Colonna's)\n\nHIS REALISTIC OPTIONS:\n\nSubmit and cooperate — Accept amnesty, work within new system. He knows Juan; perhaps he can rebuild that relationship.\n\nFollow Colonna's example — Flee to Orsini strongholds. But this cedes Rome entirely to rivals and reformers. With Colonna gone, Orsini becomes sole representative of the old Roman families—valuable position.\n\nExploit Colonna's absence — With Colonna fled, Orsini could position himself as the \"responsible\" Roman aristocrat who stayed and cooperated. Gain influence by contrast.\n\nWait and observe — Neither commit nor flee. Gather information. Classic caution.\n\nApproach Juan directly — He has history with Juan. Could seek private audience, emphasize their past relationship, position himself as bridge between reform and Roman realities.\n\nQuiet coordination with French faction — Not flee, not submit, but build coalition with Rochetaillée for future opposition within canonical structures.\n\nOpen opposition — Denounce reforms publicly. Very risky with Colonna already fled—Orsini would be isolated.\n\nKEY CALCULATION:\nColonna's flight changes everything. With his rival gone, Orsini has an opportunity: become the indispensable Roman aristocrat who knows how the city actually works. OR: follow Colonna and lose Rome entirely. His rivalry with Colonna may push him toward staying simply to fill the vacuum his enemy left.\n\nHe also knows Juan personally. He tested Juan's faith in 1430 and found it genuine. Does that history matter now?\n\nD100 TABLE: Cardinal Orsini's Reaction\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nPanic follows panic. When Orsini learns Colonna has fled, he assumes the Pope is moving against the great families. He flees Rome within hours of Colonna's departure—but in the opposite direction, toward Orsini territories near Bracciano. Both ancient houses have now abandoned Rome. The vacuum is total. But their flight looks like coordinated guilt, and Roman popular opinion turns sharply against them.\n6-15\nSolidarity with rival. Orsini sends a message to Colonna—unprecedented communication between the feuding houses. He proposes coordinated opposition from outside Rome: joint appeals to Basel, to France, to the Emperor. Ancient enemies united against common threat. If this alliance holds, it could become formidable. If it fractures along old lines, both houses are weakened.\n16-25\nFrozen calculation. Orsini does nothing. He remains in his Roman palazzo, doors closed, receiving no visitors, sending no messages. He is paralyzed between options—unwilling to flee like Colonna, unwilling to submit, unwilling to oppose. Days pass. His silence is noted. His influence erodes through inaction. When he finally moves, the moment for bold action has passed.\n26-35\nGrudging minimal compliance. Orsini sends a brief, formal letter accepting the amnesty in the most limited terms possible. He attends no meetings, makes no public statements, offers no cooperation beyond the bare legal minimum. He is preserving options—technically compliant, practically obstructionist. Waiting for the reform to fail.\n36-50\nCautious positioning. Orsini submits a carefully worded acceptance of the amnesty and requests a private audience with the Pope—not to oppose, but to \"offer counsel from one who has served the Holy See for many years.\" He is testing the waters. If Eugenius receives him warmly, he will cooperate. If coldly, he will reconsider. He is letting the Pope's reaction determine his path.\n51-65\nExploiting Colonna's absence. With his rival fled, Orsini sees opportunity. He makes a public submission—not at the Vatican, but at a Roman church, witnessed by prominent citizens. He speaks of the Orsini family's centuries of service to the Church, their loyalty to Rome itself. He positions himself as the responsible aristocrat who stayed when others fled. A play for legitimacy and influence in the new order.\n66-75\nDirect approach to Juan. Orsini requests a private audience not with the Pope, but with Juan. He invokes their history: \"Your Majesty, I tested your faith in this very city four years ago. I found it genuine then. I trust it remains so now.\" He offers cooperation—not with enthusiasm, but with pragmatic recognition that the world has changed. He asks what role a man of his experience might play in a reformed Church.\n76-85\nValuable cooperation. Orsini decides that with Colonna gone, the path to influence runs through the reformers. He provides Eugenius with useful intelligence: which Camera officials are most compromised, where hidden documents might be found, which cardinals are quietly coordinating opposition. He is betraying his class to preserve his position. Self-interested, but genuinely helpful.\n86-95\nGenuine bridge-building. Orsini approaches both Juan and Eugenius with a substantive proposal: he will use Orsini family influence to ease the reform's implementation in Rome—calming nervous officials, reassuring Roman citizens, vouching for the Pope's good intentions to those who fear Spanish domination. In exchange, he asks only for continued respect for the Orsini family's traditional role. A genuine partnership offer.\n96-100\nRedemption through service. Something about this moment—perhaps Colonna's cowardly flight, perhaps memory of Martin V's genuine piety, perhaps simple recognition that his life's work has been hollow—moves Orsini to genuine action. He publicly pledges the Orsini family's full support for reform, provides comprehensive intelligence on corrupt arrangements, and offers Orsini resources to assist Parentucelli's work. He becomes the reform's most unexpected champion among the Roman aristocracy.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

Combined with Colonna's flight (16), this means:\n- Colonna has fled Rome, losing influence\n- Orsini is staying and actively cooperating with intelligence\n- The Orsini-Colonna rivalry has led to divergent responses that benefit the reform\n\nNow I need to draft the table for Faction 3: The French Faction (Cardinal Rochetaillée + 2-3 allies).\n\nORSINI RESULT: 82 — Valuable Cooperation\n\nOrsini decides that with Colonna gone, the path to influence runs through the reformers. He provides Eugenius with useful intelligence: which Camera officials are most compromised, where hidden documents might be found, which cardinals are quietly coordinating opposition. He is betraying his class to preserve his position. Self-interested, but genuinely helpful.\n\nEMERGING PICTURE:\n\nThe two great Roman families have split dramatically:\n\nColonna: Fled to family strongholds. Absent from Rome. Sending measured criticism but not open opposition. Losing influence daily.\n\nOrsini: Stayed. Cooperating. Providing intelligence. Positioning himself as the indispensable Roman aristocrat.\n\nThis is a significant win for the reform. The ancient houses that could have united against Eugenius are instead divided, with one actively assisting.\n\nFACTION 3: The French Faction at Rome (Cardinal Jean de Rochetaillée + 2-3 allies)\n\nWHO THEY ARE:\n\nCardinal Jean de Rochetaillée leads the French faction in Rome\n\n2-3 allied cardinals of French sympathy\n\nThey remained seated during the Mass—did not kneel, did not applaud, did not participate\n\nThey report to Cardinal Louis d'Allemand at Basel, who leads the conciliarist movement\n\nIdentified as men who \"send reports to Basel; everything Juan does is monitored\"\n\nTHEIR POSITION:\n\nThey were present at the Mass—they witnessed everything\n\nThey did not openly protest or denounce, but their non-participation was noted\n\nThey are not primarily corrupt in the Camera sense—their interest is conciliarist, not financial\n\nThe Pope adopting Basel's reforms motu proprio is a complex situation for them: their reforms passed, but Rome claims credit\n\nThey serve French royal interests as much as conciliar principles\n\nTHEIR CAPABILITIES:\n\nDirect communication with Basel and Cardinal d'Allemand\n\nConnections to French crown (King Charles VII)\n\nAbility to frame the narrative of what happened today\n\nCanonical expertise—could challenge procedures, demand consultations\n\nLimited military or physical power in Rome itself\n\nInfluence over how Basel receives this news\n\nTHEIR REALISTIC OPTIONS:\n\nFrame as victory — Report to Basel that the Pope has capitulated, adopted Council reforms, admitted the Council was right. Conciliarism wins.\n\nFrame as Spanish domination — Report that the Pope acted under duress, with Castilian knights filling St. Peter's. The reforms are illegitimate because coerced.\n\nFrame as papal usurpation — The Pope adopted reforms motu proprio to steal credit from Basel. He's undermining the Council by making its decrees unnecessary.\n\nDemand consultation — Invoke canonical procedures. The College of Cardinals was not properly consulted. The Camera reform exceeds papal authority without Council approval.\n\nWait for instructions — Send factual report to Basel, let d'Allemand and the Council decide how to respond.\n\nQuiet withdrawal — Leave Rome, return to Basel or France, report in person rather than by letter.\n\nUnexpected accommodation — Accept that reform is reform, regardless of source. Work with Eugenius rather than against him.\n\nKEY CALCULATION:\nRochetaillée must decide how to frame this for Basel. The framing will shape the conciliar response. He has three possible angles:\n\nVictory (Council reforms adopted)\n\nIllegitimacy (Spanish coercion)\n\nUsurpation (Pope stealing credit)\n\nHis choice depends on what serves French/conciliar interests best. An illegitimacy frame keeps the conflict alive. A victory frame ends it. A usurpation frame escalates it.\n\nAlso: Colonna has fled, Orsini is cooperating. The Roman opposition is weaker than Rochetaillée might have hoped. Does he stand alone?\n\nD100 TABLE: French Faction's Reaction\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDisastrous overreach. Rochetaillée publicly denounces the reforms as illegitimate Spanish coercion before leaving the basilica. His protest is loud, theatrical, and immediately undermined when other cardinals fail to support him. He looks isolated, foolish, and desperate. His report to Basel is tainted by his obvious personal humiliation. D'Allemand receives the news through the lens of Rochetaillée's embarrassment.\n6-15\nAggressive framing—Spanish domination. Rochetaillée dispatches messengers within hours. His report emphasizes the Castilian knights, Juan's oath, the military occupation of the Camera. \"The Pope speaks with a Spanish sword at his throat.\" This framing poisons Basel's reception, makes reconciliation harder, and sets up prolonged conflict between Rome and Council.\n16-25\nAggressive framing—papal usurpation. The report to Basel frames this as a cynical papal power grab. \"Eugenius adopts our reforms to make the Council irrelevant. If Rome can reform itself, why does Basel exist?\" This framing threatens the Council's purpose and energizes the most radical conciliarists. Escalation likely.\n26-40\nHostile but factual. Rochetaillée sends a detailed, accurate report with hostile editorial framing. The facts are correct, but the interpretation is negative: \"reform under foreign pressure,\" \"unprecedented procedures,\" \"College marginalized.\" Basel receives good intelligence tinted with suspicion. D'Allemand must decide how to respond.\n41-55\nFactual report, await instructions. Rochetaillée sends a messenger with a straightforward account of what occurred, minimizing his own interpretation. He asks Basel for guidance: \"How shall we respond? What position serves the Council's interests?\" He is deferring to d'Allemand rather than shaping the narrative himself. Professional, cautious.\n56-65\nNuanced framing—partial victory. Rochetaillée's report acknowledges complexity: \"The Pope has adopted our reforms, which is what we demanded. The method was irregular, but the substance is sound. We should consider accepting this as vindication of conciliar principles.\" This opens door to negotiated settlement between Rome and Basel.\n66-75\nStrategic withdrawal. Rochetaillée decides to report in person rather than by letter. He departs Rome within days, traveling to Basel with his allies. His personal account will carry more weight than any written message. This delays Basel's response but ensures the Council hears a nuanced, firsthand report.\n76-85\nUnexpected pragmatism. Rochetaillée reports to Basel that the situation is more complex than simple opposition allows. He notes that Eugenius adopted Basel's reforms willingly, that the Camera reform targets genuine corruption, that the Spanish king swore to defend the Church, not to dominate her. He recommends Basel accept this as grounds for reconciliation rather than continued conflict.\n86-95\nQuiet reassessment. Something about today's events—the light, the kneeling cardinals, the genuine conviction in Eugenius's voice—gives Rochetaillée pause. His report to Basel is surprisingly balanced. Privately, he requests a meeting with the Pope to discuss \"how Basel and Rome might work together in this new circumstance.\" He is opening a door.\n96-100\nConversion to cooperation. Rochetaillée experiences a genuine shift. He sends word to Basel that the Council's work is vindicated—Rome has adopted their reforms. He recommends declaring victory and seeking reconciliation. Simultaneously, he approaches Eugenius offering to serve as bridge between Rome and Basel. The French faction in Rome becomes an asset rather than obstacle.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

But:\n- The Pope claims credit, not the Council\n- The principle of papal supremacy is reinforced, not conciliar supremacy\n- A foreign king is now sworn to defend the Pope\n- The Camera reform was done without any Council involvement\n- If this succeeds, it proves the Pope CAN reform the Church - making the Council less necessary\n\n**Their Realistic Options:**\n\n1. **Frame as Spanish domination/coercion** - This is their strongest card. 591 armed knights in St. Peter's. A foreign king swearing oaths. This looks like military occupation.\n\n2. **Frame as papal usurpation** - \"The Pope stole our reforms to make the Council irrelevant\"\n\n3. **Frame as victory** - \"The Pope capitulated and adopted our reforms\" - but this undermines the Council's purpose\n\n4. **Demand Council approval** - The Camera reform wasn't passed by Basel. They could argue it's illegitimate without Council sanction.\n \n5. **Appeal to France** - King Charles VII might be their strategic lifeline. The French faction could leverage national interests to challenge the papal reforms, positioning themselves as defenders of French sovereignty and ecclesiastical policy.\n\n**Strategic Implications:**\nThe current situation exposes Basel's institutional weakness. With procedural gridlock and the French faction's obstructionist tactics, their influence is rapidly diminishing. Cardinal d'Allemand's leadership faces a critical test in maintaining the conciliar movement's relevance against papal maneuvers.\n\nThank you. Now I have much better context on the French faction.\n\nFACTION 3: The French Faction at Rome (Cardinal Jean de Rochetaillée + 2-3 allies)\n\nWHO THEY ARE:\n\nCardinal Jean de Rochetaillée leads the French-aligned cardinals in Rome\n\nThey report to Cardinal Louis d'Allemand (Aleman) at Basel, who leads the radical conciliarist movement\n\n8-10 cardinals in Rome are aligned with this faction\n\nThey push for absolute conciliar supremacy—reducing the Pope to a figurehead bound by Council decisions\n\nThey serve French royal interests (King Charles VII) as much as conciliar principles\n\nThey remained seated during the Mass—observing, calculating, not participating\n\nTHEIR POSITION:\n\nThis event is catastrophic for their constitutional agenda\n\nThe Pope adopted Basel's reforms motu proprio—on his own authority, not in submission to the Council\n\nThis is exactly what Juan proposed in the Declaration of Como: parallel legislation that achieves reform without conceding papal subordination to councils\n\nThe Camera reform was done entirely outside Council authority—Basel was not consulted\n\nA foreign king has sworn to defend the Pope, not the Council\n\nIf this succeeds, it proves the Pope CAN reform the Church independently—making the Council less necessary\n\nTheir years of procedural warfare at Basel, blocking progress to force constitutional crisis, may have been rendered irrelevant\n\nTHEIR CAPABILITIES:\n\nDirect communication line to Cardinal d'Allemand at Basel\n\nConnections to French crown (King Charles VII)\n\nCanonical expertise—could challenge procedures, invoke Council authority\n\nAbility to frame the narrative of what happened today\n\nAt Basel: 60-80 committed French faction supporters, enough to obstruct but not command\n\nNO military or physical power in Rome—591 Castilian knights versus nothing\n\nCould flee Rome and work from Basel or France\n\nTHEIR REALISTIC OPTIONS:\n\nFrame as Spanish military coercion — Their strongest argument. 591 armed knights in St. Peter's. A foreign king swearing oaths. \"The Pope speaks with a Spanish sword at his throat.\" This delegitimizes everything that happened today.\n\nFrame as papal usurpation — \"The Pope stole our reforms to make the Council irrelevant. If Rome can reform itself, why does Basel exist?\" This energizes radical conciliarists.\n\nDemand Council approval — The Camera reform wasn't passed by Basel. Argue it's illegitimate without Council sanction. Force the constitutional question.\n\nAppeal to King Charles VII — French royal interests are threatened by Spanish-papal alliance. Invoke crown support for French position at Basel.\n\nFrame as partial victory, demand more — Acknowledge reforms passed but insist Council must ratify them. Keep the pressure on.\n\nWait for failure — The reform is ambitious. If it fails in implementation, Rochetaillée can say \"this is why we need proper conciliar oversight.\"\n\nUnexpected pragmatism — Accept that reform happened and try to work with the new reality. (Unlikely given their ideological commitment)\n\nKEY CALCULATION:\nRochetaillée must decide quickly—messengers from others will reach Basel soon. The framing that arrives first shapes perception. His report to d'Allemand will determine the conciliar response.\n\nThe \"Spanish coercion\" frame is compelling because it's partially true—there WERE 591 knights in St. Peter's. But it also risks making the French faction look like they oppose reform itself, not just the method. And Colonna's flight, Orsini's cooperation, and eight cardinals kneeling undercuts the \"coercion\" narrative—would they kneel willingly if this were mere military occupation?\n\nD100 TABLE: French Faction's Reaction\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nDisastrous public confrontation. Rochetaillée attempts to denounce the proceedings before leaving St. Peter's—rising to declare the Pope acts under duress, the reforms illegitimate, the Council's authority usurped. But with eight cardinals already kneeling and 591 knights watching, his protest dies in the silence that follows. No one joins him. He storms out alone, humiliated. His report to Basel is tainted by obvious personal failure. D'Allemand receives a bitter screed, not strategic analysis.\n6-15\nAggressive framing: Spanish conquest of the papacy. Rochetaillée dispatches multiple messengers within hours. His report to d'Allemand emphasizes military occupation: \"The Pope spoke with Castilian steel at his throat. 591 armed soldiers filled St. Peter's. This is not reform—this is conquest. The Spanish king has made the Pope his puppet. Basel must act to free the Church from foreign domination.\" This frame poisons all subsequent negotiation. War between Rome and Basel becomes likely.\n16-25\nAggressive framing: papal usurpation. The report emphasizes constitutional violation: \"Eugenius has stolen our reforms to render the Council irrelevant. He claims motu proprio what we achieved through years of labor. The Camera reform—passed without any Council consultation—proves he seeks to rule without accountability. If Rome can reform itself, Basel has no purpose. We must reassert conciliar authority or admit defeat.\" This escalates the constitutional crisis.\n26-35\nAppeal to France. Before reporting to Basel, Rochetaillée sends urgent message to King Charles VII's court. \"Spanish influence over Rome threatens French interests. The Castilian king has bound the Pope to his protection—an alliance aimed at France. Your Majesty must support the Council against this Spanish-papal axis.\" He is invoking secular power to fight an ecclesiastical battle. If France engages, the conflict expands beyond Church politics.\n36-50\nHostile but factual report. Rochetaillée sends a detailed, accurate account to d'Allemand with hostile interpretation: \"The Pope adopted our reforms—but claimed independent authority. The Camera reform bypassed Basel entirely. A Spanish king swore to defend Rome, not the Council. Eight cardinals submitted publicly; Colonna fled; Orsini cooperates. The situation is worse than open defiance—it is absorption of our cause under papal authority.\" D'Allemand receives good intelligence, must decide response.\n51-60\nDemand for Council ratification. Rochetaillée's report proposes a middle path: \"Accept the reforms as consistent with Basel's decrees, but demand the Camera reform be submitted to Council for ratification. If Eugenius refuses, we expose his claims of 'parallel legislation' as fraud. If he accepts, we establish precedent that major reforms require conciliar approval.\" This is procedural warfare—continuing the fight through canonical mechanisms.\n61-70\nStrategic withdrawal to Basel. Rochetaillée decides the situation in Rome is lost—better to report in person than by letter. He departs Rome within days with his French allies, traveling to Basel. His personal account will carry weight with d'Allemand. This delays Basel's response but removes French opposition from Rome during the critical implementation period. The reformers have breathing room.\n71-80\nNuanced report: partial victory, continued vigilance. Rochetaillée's message acknowledges complexity: \"The Pope adopted our reforms—this is what we demanded. The method was irregular, but the substance is sound. The Camera reform is concerning but may serve the cause of accountability we championed. I recommend Basel accept this as vindication of conciliar principles while insisting on oversight of implementation.\" This opens door to negotiated settlement.\n81-90\nUnexpected pragmatism. Something about today's events—the genuine conviction in Eugenius's voice, the evidence of Camera corruption, the sight of cardinals weeping—gives Rochetaillée pause. His report to d'Allemand is surprisingly measured: \"The reforms we sought have been achieved. The constitutional question remains unresolved, but perhaps this is acceptable if the Church is actually reformed. I recommend we declare victory and seek reconciliation rather than continued conflict.\"\n91-95\nPrivate reassessment. Rochetaillée requests a meeting with Cardinal Cesarini at Basel rather than d'Allemand—seeking the moderate voice rather than the radical leader. His message suggests that perhaps the constitutional question matters less than actual reform. \"If Rome and Basel can cooperate on implementation, the question of supremacy becomes academic.\" He is opening a channel for genuine reconciliation.\n96-100\nGenuine conversion. The impossible: a French faction leader recognizing that the cause he served was more about power than reform. Rochetaillée sends word to Basel that the Council's work is vindicated—Rome has adopted their reforms. He recommends declaring victory and ending the constitutional conflict. Simultaneously, he approaches Eugenius offering to serve as bridge between Rome and Basel. The French faction in Rome fractures as their leader changes sides.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

Combined with Colonna's flight (16) and Orsini's cooperation (82), the opposition in Rome is collapsing. The French faction leader—who was supposed to be the enemy—is now recommending reconciliation with Rome.\n\nNow for Faction 4: The Medici Bank.\n\nLet me think about who they are and what they can do...\n\nFRENCH FACTION RESULT: 99 — Genuine Conversion\n\nThe impossible: a French faction leader recognizing that the cause he served was more about power than reform.

Colonna fled. Orsini is cooperating. And now Rochetaillée, of all people, is recommending that Basel declare victory and end the conflict.\n\nSomething genuinely miraculous appears to be happening.\n\nFACTION 4: The Medici Bank\n\nWHO THEY ARE:\n\nThe Medici Bank is the dominant financial institution in Italy, arguably in Europe\n\nLed by Cosimo de' Medici (age ~45 in 1434), the wealthiest private citizen in Christendom\n\nThey are the Church's primary bankers—handling papal revenues, transfers, and loans\n\nThe Camera owes them approximately 60,000 florins in external debt\n\nThey hold \"informal arrangements\" with multiple cardinals—loans against Church revenue streams\n\nThey possess correspondence, records, and evidence of arrangements that could embarrass many powerful men\n\nLucia attempted to gather intelligence through Medici channels before the audience (Roll: 39—polite evasion)\n\nTHEIR POSITION:\n\nThe Camera reform directly threatens their business model:\n\"No banker may retain funds or deduct fees without specific written authorization\"\n\nBanking relationships must be restructured\n\nQuarterly public accounts will expose previously hidden arrangements\n\nCardinals' debts to bankers become visible, reducing Medici leverage\n\nThe 60,000 florins owed to them is now subject to \"restructuring\"\n\nTheir leverage over indebted cardinals is evaporating as arrangements become public\n\nHOWEVER: They are businessmen, not ideologues. If the new system offers opportunities, they will adapt.\n\nALSO: They have enemies. The Albizzi faction in Florence opposes Medici dominance. A weakened Medici is good for their rivals.\n\nTHEIR CAPABILITIES:\n\nVast wealth—can fund allies, bribe officials, hire agents\n\nInformation networks across Europe—they know things\n\nControl of credit—can make or break institutions and individuals\n\nPolitical influence in Florence (though not yet formal control—Cosimo's rise to power is still developing in 1434)\n\nRelationships with every major court in Europe\n\nThe ability to make the Camera reform succeed or fail through cooperation or obstruction\n\nDocuments and correspondence that could be embarrassing or valuable depending on how they use them\n\nTHEIR REALISTIC OPTIONS:\n\nObstruction — Refuse to cooperate with restructuring. Demand immediate repayment of 60,000 florins. Call in cardinal debts. Create financial chaos to prove reform is unworkable.\n\nLeverage what they know — The documents they hold are valuable. Offer to \"assist\" Parentucelli's investigation in exchange for favorable treatment in the new system.\n\nPivot to opportunity — A reformed, transparent Camera still needs bankers. Position the Medici as partners in reform, not obstacles. Lose some leverage but gain legitimacy.\n\nWait and watch — Don't commit either way. See if the reform actually succeeds before deciding how to respond. Classic banker caution.\n\nSelective cooperation — Provide some assistance, withhold other things. Negotiate position piece by piece.\n\nBack the opposition — Colonna is in the countryside. D'Allemand is at Basel. Fund resistance to the reform in hopes of restoration.\n\nApproach Juan directly — The King of Castile is the power behind this reform. If the Medici can build a relationship with Castile, they gain a new patron more powerful than any cardinal.\n\nKEY CALCULATION:\nCosimo de' Medici is a pragmatist, not an ideologue. He built his fortune by adapting to circumstances, not fighting them. The question is: does he see this reform as a threat to be resisted, or a transition to be navigated?\n\nKey factors:\n\nThe 60,000 florin debt: Is it safer to demand payment (risking confrontation) or negotiate favorable terms (accepting some loss)?\n\nCardinal leverage: Already eroding as Orsini cooperates and arrangements become public. Cut losses or double down?\n\nFuture business: A transparent Camera still needs banking services. Being the reform's banker is safer than being its enemy.\n\nJuan's power: 591 knights, sworn to defend the Pope. The Medici cannot fight Castile.\n\nInformation value: What they know could help Parentucelli—or hurt him. Which use serves Medici interests better?\n\nCosimo did not become the richest man in Europe by fighting losing battles. But he also did not become rich by surrendering without negotiation.\n\nD100 TABLE: Medici Bank's Reaction\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCatastrophic misjudgment. The Medici bank manager in Rome panics and attempts to move funds and documents before Parentucelli can examine them. The attempt is noticed. Castilian knights intercept a Medici courier carrying sensitive correspondence. The documents reveal specific arrangements between the bank and corrupt cardinals—evidence Parentucelli desperately wanted. The Medici are now implicated in the very corruption being reformed. Cosimo must distance himself from his own Rome operation or be tarred with the scandal.\n6-15\nHostile obstruction. The Medici demand immediate repayment of the 60,000 florin debt, citing \"changed circumstances.\" They refuse to provide records without formal legal process. They quietly encourage their cardinal clients to resist reform. This creates financial pressure on the Camera at its most vulnerable moment—but also marks the Medici as enemies of reform. If the reform succeeds anyway, they have made a powerful enemy.\n16-25\nCold non-cooperation. The Medici provide exactly what is legally required and nothing more. They answer questions tersely. They make no voluntary disclosures. They delay, require documentation, invoke procedures. They are not actively hostile, but they are not helpful. The reform proceeds without Medici assistance—slower, harder, but not impossible. The relationship becomes transactional rather than adversarial.\n26-40\nCautious negotiation. The Medici request a meeting with Parentucelli—not to obstruct, but to discuss terms. They want to know: Will existing debts be honored? Will new arrangements be possible? What role might the bank play in a reformed system? They are protecting their interests, not fighting the reform. The conversation is tense but productive. Some accommodation is possible.\n41-55\nPragmatic adaptation. Cosimo de' Medici sends word from Florence: cooperate. The Rome branch provides records as requested, answers questions honestly, and proposes restructured terms for the outstanding debt. They accept that some arrangements are ending but position themselves as reliable partners for whatever replaces them. Business-like, neither enthusiastic nor hostile.\n56-70\nOpportunistic cooperation. The Medici see opportunity in chaos. They provide Parentucelli with useful information about Camera finances—not everything, but enough to be helpful. They propose new banking arrangements that serve reform goals while preserving Medici involvement. They are trying to become the reform's banker rather than its victim. Self-interested but genuinely useful.\n71-80\nValuable partnership. The Medici provide substantial assistance: detailed records of Camera transactions, information about where money actually went, documentation of arrangements that corrupt officials tried to hide. In exchange, they request only that legitimate debts be honored and that the Medici remain the Camera's banking partner. Parentucelli gains weeks of investigative work. The reform is strengthened.\n81-90\nStrategic alliance offer. Cosimo de' Medici sends a personal representative to meet not with Parentucelli but with Juan. The message: \"The Medici Bank wishes to establish a relationship with Castile. We can be useful to Your Majesty in many ways—in Italy, in trade, in information. We offer our services.\" They are looking past this immediate crisis to long-term positioning. If Juan accepts, he gains a powerful financial ally.\n91-95\nFull disclosure. The Medici decide that complete transparency serves their interests better than selective cooperation. They provide Parentucelli with everything: all records, all correspondence, all documentation of cardinal arrangements. \"We were bankers, not thieves. We served clients who made their own choices. Here is the evidence of what they chose.\" This is devastating to the corrupt cardinals but positions the Medici as honest businessmen who merely facilitated others' sins.\n96-100\nTransformation into reform instrument. Cosimo de' Medici recognizes a historic opportunity. He offers the Medici Bank as the instrument of Camera reform: new transparent accounting systems, proper documentation, quarterly reporting—all the mechanisms Parentucelli needs but lacks expertise to implement. In exchange, the Medici become the official bankers of a reformed papacy. The very institution that enabled corruption becomes the guarantor of transparency. It is audacious, self-serving, and potentially brilliant.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

The amnesty only protects those who stay and cooperate.\n\nDestroy private documents — Burn anything incriminating before the 30-day deadline. Accept amnesty, claim ignorance, hope the gaps aren't noticed.\n\nFull cooperation — Surrender everything, testify truthfully, embrace reform. Accept amnesty gratefully. Survive as minor functionaries in new system.\n\nSelective cooperation — Surrender some documents, hide others. Cooperate partially. Try to protect themselves while appearing compliant.\n\nNegotiate individually — Approach Parentucelli with specific evidence against others in exchange for favorable treatment. Become witnesses rather than defendants.\n\nBand together — Coordinate with other officials. Agree on common story. Protect each other through collective silence or collective action.\n\nAppeal to patrons — Some officials served specific cardinals. Seek protection from their former masters. (But Colonna fled and Orsini is cooperating—patron protection may not exist.)\n\nKEY CALCULATION:\nThese are not powerful men. They are clerks and functionaries who profited from a corrupt system. Their patrons are scattered—Colonna fled, Orsini is cooperating, the French faction's leader just recommended reconciliation.\n\nThe amnesty offers them a lifeline. The question is: do they trust it? And do they have things hidden that they fear discovery of more than they trust the amnesty?\n\nThe Medici are already providing records. Orsini is providing intelligence. The walls are closing in. Information that seemed safely hidden yesterday may be exposed tomorrow through other sources.\n\nD100 TABLE: Camera Officials' Reaction\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCoordinated destruction. Several senior clerks coordinate overnight—burning documents, hiding wealth, preparing flight. But they are not subtle men, and the smoke from burning papers draws attention. Pallavicini's guards investigate. Two officials are caught mid-destruction with partially burned ledgers. The fragments that survive are damning—and the act of destruction itself proves consciousness of guilt. The amnesty may not apply to men caught actively obstructing. Parentucelli has both evidence and examples.\n6-15\nFlight of the most guilty. Three or four officials with the greatest personal exposure flee Rome before dawn—taking what portable wealth they can carry and documents that would have incriminated them. They scatter to different destinations: one to Florence, one toward Naples, one to family in the countryside. The reform loses potential witnesses, but also loses the most corrupt actors. Those who remain are more likely to cooperate. Some gaps in the records will never be filled.\n16-25\nWidespread document destruction. Most officials who weren't in the building use the night to destroy private papers. By morning, dozens of household fires have consumed years of correspondence, personal ledgers, and informal records. The official Camera records survive (secured by Parentucelli), but the private documentation that would have connected individuals to specific arrangements is largely gone. The investigation can prove systemic corruption but struggles to prove individual guilt. The amnesty becomes almost universal by necessity.\n26-35\nFearful paralysis. The officials are terrified but indecisive. They neither flee nor destroy nor cooperate—they simply wait, hoping someone tells them what to do. Their patrons are unavailable (Colonna fled, others are distracted). The 30-day deadline looms. Some will eventually cooperate; others will eventually destroy evidence; a few may eventually flee. But in the critical first days, they do nothing, giving Parentucelli time to secure external records (like the Medici's) that constrain their options.\n36-50\nGrudging compliance. Most officials conclude that the amnesty is real and cooperation is safer than resistance. Over the following days, documents trickle in—some complete, some suspiciously incomplete. Testimony is given—some forthcoming, some evasive. The officials are cooperating with the letter of the decree, if not always its spirit. Parentucelli must work to distinguish genuine cooperation from protective compliance. The investigation proceeds, slower than ideal but not obstructed.\n51-65\nMixed response. The officials split. Some cooperate fully, seeing opportunity in the new order. Some cooperate minimally, protecting themselves while avoiding active obstruction. A few attempt to flee or destroy evidence—but they are the minority, and their absence or actions are noted. Parentucelli can identify who is trustworthy and who is not. The cooperative officials become the core of a reformed Camera staff.\n66-75\nCompetitive cooperation. Word spreads quickly that the Medici are providing records and Orsini is providing intelligence. Officials realize that their private knowledge is a depreciating asset—the longer they wait, the less valuable their cooperation becomes. Several rush to Parentucelli with documents and testimony, trying to be helpful before others expose them. The investigation accelerates as frightened men compete to be witnesses rather than defendants.\n76-85\nValuable witnesses emerge. Two or three officials with detailed knowledge of Camera operations approach Parentucelli voluntarily. They bring private records that document specific arrangements, name names, provide dates and amounts. They are not doing this from virtue—they are frightened men buying safety with information. But their testimony is genuine and detailed. Parentucelli gains witnesses who can explain not just what happened, but how and why.\n86-95\nComprehensive surrender. The combination of secured Camera records, Medici cooperation, and Orsini's intelligence creates an overwhelming impression that resistance is futile. Officials begin appearing at the Camera building with boxes of private documents, asking to give testimony. The amnesty has worked as intended—offering escape to those who cooperate, leaving only the most stubborn exposed. Parentucelli has more evidence than he can process. The investigation's problem becomes organization, not discovery.\n96-100\nUnexpected revelation. A senior clerk—one who managed specific cardinal accounts for twenty years—approaches Parentucelli with something extraordinary: a private ledger he kept as \"insurance,\" documenting every irregular arrangement he facilitated. Names, dates, amounts, signatures. He never intended to use it except to protect himself if blamed for others' sins. Now he surrenders it in exchange for amnesty and a position in the reformed Camera. This single document is more valuable than weeks of investigation. The corruption is not merely proven—it is catalogued.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

According to the project files, he was described as \"not the problem—he is the solution to a problem the corrupt men solved long ago. They needed a respectable figurehead who would not interfere. The real decisions are made by clerks who have held positions for decades.\"\n\nSo Condulmer is the Pope's nephew, a figurehead who was put in place because he wouldn't ask questions. He's not personally corrupt in the same way as others, but he enabled corruption through negligence or willful blindness. Now his uncle has just reformed the institution he nominally headed, and Parentucelli has been given authority over it.\n\nThis is a delicate personal situation - family dynamics, public humiliation, questions of competence vs. corruption.\n\nCAMERA OFFICIALS RESULT: 10 — Flight of the Most Guilty\n\nThree or four officials with the greatest personal exposure flee Rome before dawn—taking what portable wealth they can carry and documents that would have incriminated them. They scatter to different destinations: one to Florence, one toward Naples, one to family in the countryside. The reform loses potential witnesses, but also loses the most corrupt actors. Those who remain are more likely to cooperate. Some gaps in the records will never be filled.\n\nTHE RUNNING TALLY:\n\nFaction\nRoll\nResult\nColonna\n16\nFlight to safety—absent from Rome, influence bleeding\nOrsini\n82\nValuable cooperation—providing intelligence\nFrench Faction\n99\nGenuine conversion—recommends reconciliation with Basel\nMedici Bank\n74\nValuable partnership—providing records, supporting reform\nCamera Officials\n10\nFlight of the most guilty—worst actors flee, rest more cooperative\n\nThe first complication. The most corrupt officials have escaped with incriminating documents. Some evidence is permanently lost. But the silver lining: those who remain are the less guilty, more likely to cooperate. The worst actors have self-selected out.\n\nFACTION 6: Cardinal Francesco Condulmer (The Camerlengo)\n\nWHO HE IS:\n\nThe Pope's nephew—Eugenius IV's own family\n\nHolds the title of Camerlengo, nominally the head of the Apostolic Camera\n\nAccording to Parentucelli's analysis: \"He is not the problem—he is the solution to a problem the corrupt men solved long ago. They needed a respectable figurehead who would not interfere. The real decisions are made by clerks who have held positions for decades.\"\n\nHe was put in place precisely BECAUSE he would not ask questions\n\nAge unclear, but likely 30s-40s—old enough for a cardinalate, young enough to have been managed by senior clerks\n\nHIS POSITION:\n\nHis uncle just publicly reformed the institution he nominally led\n\nParentucelli—a mere secretary—has been given extraordinary authority over the Camera, superseding the Camerlengo\n\nHe has been publicly revealed as either incompetent (didn't know about corruption) or complicit (knew and did nothing)\n\nEither reading is humiliating for a cardinal of his station\n\nThe documents signed last night suspend \"all Camera officials pending review\"—does this include him?\n\nHis family relationship with Eugenius is both protection and complication\n\nHe was NOT present at the late-night drafting session—he learned of this like everyone else\n\nHIS PSYCHOLOGY:\n\nHe has been a figurehead, managed by others, for years\n\nHe may not fully understand what was happening under his nominal authority\n\nHe may feel betrayed by his uncle—why wasn't he warned? Why wasn't he included?\n\nHe may feel relieved—the burden of an office he never controlled is lifted\n\nHe may feel humiliated—publicly exposed as either fool or knave\n\nFamily loyalty vs. personal dignity vs. institutional position\n\nHIS CAPABILITIES:\n\nFamily access to the Pope—he can demand to speak with his uncle privately\n\nCardinal's rank and dignity—still a prince of the Church\n\nKnowledge of Camera operations (limited, but some)\n\nCould publicly support or oppose the reform\n\nCould work with Parentucelli or obstruct him\n\nCould appeal to other cardinals as victim of Spanish influence over his uncle\n\nCould retire from public life with dignity or fight for relevance\n\nHIS REALISTIC OPTIONS:\n\nWounded dignity, public opposition — Denounce the reform as insult to his office and person. Demand restoration of Camerlengo authority. Invoke family relationship publicly. Force Eugenius to choose between nephew and reform.\n\nPrivate confrontation with Eugenius — Demand explanation from his uncle. Express hurt at exclusion. Seek private accommodation—perhaps a face-saving role, retirement with honor, or quiet rehabilitation.\n\nPublic submission, private resentment — Accept the reform publicly, maintain dignity, but nurse grievance. Wait for opportunity to undermine Parentucelli or reclaim position.\n\nGenuine cooperation — Recognize that he was a figurehead, that the corruption was real, that reform is necessary. Work with Parentucelli. Accept diminished role with grace. Family loyalty to uncle overrides personal pride.\n\nRetirement with dignity — Request release from the Camerlengo position. Withdraw from curial affairs. Maintain cardinal's rank but step back from active governance. Avoid humiliation by choosing exit.\n\nSeek alternative role — Accept that the Camera position is lost. Request different assignment where he can serve without the taint of Camera corruption. Diplomatic mission, episcopal appointment, something that removes him from the scene of his failure.\n\nBecome reform advocate — Embrace the reform publicly and enthusiastically. Claim he always knew something was wrong but lacked authority to act. Position himself as ally of Parentucelli, not obstacle. Requires swallowing considerable pride.\n\nKEY CALCULATION:\nCondulmer's response depends heavily on his character—which we don't fully know. Is he a proud man who will see this as unforgivable humiliation? A practical man who will adapt to new circumstances? A weak man who was genuinely manipulated and is now relieved? A resentful man who will nurse grievance for years?\n\nHis family relationship cuts both ways. Eugenius may feel guilty about humiliating his nephew. But Eugenius also just committed to reform with his soul—will he let family sentiment undermine it?\n\nThe reform does not require Condulmer's support. But open opposition from the Pope's own nephew would be embarrassing and could embolden others.\n\nD100 TABLE: Cardinal Condulmer's Reaction\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nPublic rupture. Condulmer feels the humiliation as unbearable. He issues a public statement denouncing his treatment—excluded from discussions about his own office, superseded by a mere secretary, his reputation destroyed without opportunity to defend himself. He demands the College of Cardinals review whether proper procedures were followed. He does not attack the reform directly, but attacks the process—and by extension, his uncle's judgment. Family breach becomes public scandal. Eugenius must choose between nephew and reform.\n6-15\nBitter private confrontation. Condulmer demands immediate private audience with his uncle. The conversation is painful—accusations of betrayal, family loyalty invoked, tears and anger. Condulmer does not publicly oppose but makes clear he considers himself wronged. The relationship is damaged. Condulmer withdraws from curial affairs, nursing grievance. He becomes a potential rallying point for anyone dissatisfied with the reform—not actively opposing, but visibly wounded.\n16-25\nCold formal compliance. Condulmer submits a terse statement accepting \"His Holiness's decision regarding Camera administration.\" The language is technically correct but the coldness is unmistakable. He attends no meetings related to the reform. He answers questions minimally. He performs his remaining duties mechanically. He is complying while making clear he considers himself ill-used. An uncomfortable presence rather than active obstacle.\n26-35\nRequest for retirement. Condulmer approaches his uncle privately and requests release from the Camerlengo position. He does not oppose the reform but cannot bear to remain in a role now stripped of meaning. He asks for a face-saving transition—perhaps announcement that he requested reassignment to focus on other duties. Eugenius can grant this, allowing his nephew dignified exit. The Camera reform proceeds without family complications.\n36-50\nDignified acceptance. After initial shock, Condulmer concludes that fighting is futile and counterproductive. He issues a statement supporting the reform and expressing confidence in Parentucelli. He offers to assist the transition \"in whatever capacity His Holiness deems appropriate.\" The words are formal but not bitter. He is accepting diminished status with what grace he can muster. Family relationship strained but not broken.\n51-65\nPrivate reconciliation, public cooperation. Condulmer requests private audience with his uncle—not to confront, but to understand. The conversation is difficult but ultimately healing. Eugenius explains why he acted as he did; Condulmer accepts that he was part of a problem he didn't create but also didn't stop. He publicly pledges support for reform and offers to work with Parentucelli. Genuine, if painful, family reconciliation.\n66-75\nActive cooperation. Condulmer recognizes opportunity in crisis. He approaches Parentucelli directly, offering his knowledge of Camera procedures—limited but real—and his authority to smooth the transition. \"I did not know what was happening beneath me. Now that I know, I want to help fix it.\" Whether from genuine conviction or calculated positioning, he becomes a useful ally. His cardinal's rank gives Parentucelli's work additional legitimacy.\n76-85\nValuable institutional bridge. Condulmer becomes the connection between old Camera and new. He knows which officials are honest, which procedures are legitimate, which records are reliable. He cannot investigate corruption—he didn't see it—but he can help Parentucelli understand how the Camera is supposed to work versus how it actually worked. His cooperation significantly accelerates the reform's implementation. Family relationship strengthens through shared purpose.\n86-95\nGenuine transformation. The reform shocks Condulmer into recognizing his own failure. He was a figurehead who didn't ask questions because questions were uncomfortable. He enabled corruption through negligence. This recognition produces not resentment but genuine repentance. He publicly acknowledges his failure, praises his uncle's courage, pledges himself to the reform's success. He asks Parentucelli for guidance on how he can help. Becomes vocal advocate for transparency and accountability.\n96-100\nUnexpected revelation. Condulmer, shaken by events, realizes he possesses something valuable: his own private observations from years as nominal head. He didn't understand what he was seeing, but he saw things—conversations, behaviors, patterns. He brings these observations to Parentucelli: \"I thought these were normal. Now I realize they were not.\" His testimony, combined with records from other sources, helps Parentucelli understand not just what happened, but how the corrupt system actually functioned day-to-day. The figurehead becomes a key witness.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

Anyone dissatisfied with the reform now has a sympathetic figure—a cardinal wronged by his own uncle. This could matter later.\n\nFACTION 7: The Reform Cardinals (Those Who Knelt)\n\nWHO THEY ARE:\n\nEight cardinals who publicly knelt before Eugenius during the Mass\n\nCardinal Niccolò Albergati — Carthusian, ~70 years old, lived simply his entire life, wept openly, declared this \"the answer to forty years of prayers\"\n\nCardinal Domenico Capranica — Career diplomat, careful politician, the one who started the applause, has whispered of reform before but never committed publicly until today\n\nSix others — Names not specified, but cardinals who chose in the moment to publicly align with reform\n\nThese men made their pledge in the heat of an extraordinary moment—golden light, weeping Pope, Castilian knights, the pressure of the crowd\n\nTHEIR POSITION:\n\nThey have publicly committed—kneeling before witnesses, pledging support\n\nThey cannot easily reverse without severe loss of face\n\nBut pledges made in emotional moments must be sustained in cold political reality\n\nSome may have knelt from genuine conviction (Albergati)\n\nSome may have knelt from political calculation (Capranica)\n\nSome may have knelt from crowd pressure and now regret it\n\nThe days following will test whether public commitment becomes practical action\n\nTHE RANGE OF MOTIVATIONS:\n\nTrue believers — Men like Albergati who genuinely wanted reform and see this as answered prayer\n\nPolitical calculators — Men like Capranica who saw which way the wind was blowing and positioned themselves accordingly\n\nSwept up in the moment — Cardinals who knelt because others were kneeling, because the pressure was overwhelming, because refusing seemed impossible in that instant\n\nHedging bets — Cardinals who knelt to be on the winning side but will quietly obstruct if the reform falters\n\nTHEIR CAPABILITIES:\n\nCollectively, they represent majority of cardinals present in Rome\n\nThey can provide legitimacy, advice, and institutional support\n\nThey can obstruct through delay, \"concerns,\" procedural objections\n\nThey have networks, influence, and knowledge of how the Curia works\n\nThey can make Parentucelli's work easier or harder\n\nSome have their own arrangements with the Camera that are now void—self-interest may conflict with public pledge\n\nTHEIR REALISTIC OPTIONS:\n\nSustained genuine support — Follow through on public commitment with practical assistance. Attend meetings, provide counsel, use influence to smooth implementation.\n\nSymbolic support, practical distance — Maintain public stance but avoid active involvement. Let others do the work. Preserve the pledge without risk.\n\nQuiet obstruction — Publicly supportive, privately raising \"concerns,\" suggesting delays, finding procedural problems. Slow the reform without openly opposing it.\n\nWait and watch — Neither help nor hinder. See if the reform succeeds before investing further. Preserve options.\n\nSelective engagement — Support parts of the reform that don't threaten their interests, obstruct parts that do. Negotiate position piece by piece.\n\nRally around wounded Condulmer — The Pope's nephew feels betrayed. Some cardinals may quietly sympathize, creating faction within faction.\n\nExceed expectations — Go beyond pledges to become active reform champions. Use influence aggressively to advance implementation.\n\nKEY CALCULATION:\nEight cardinals knelt. But eight is not one—they are individuals with different motivations, different interests, different levels of genuine commitment. The question is not \"do they support reform\" but \"how many genuinely support it, and what do the others actually do?\"\n\nAlbergati seems genuinely committed—but he is 70 years old and contemplative, better at prayer than action.\n\nCapranica is energetic and capable—but he is also a calculator who has never committed to anything before it was safe.\n\nThe others are unknown quantities.\n\nAnd now Condulmer—the Pope's wounded nephew—provides a sympathetic alternative for any cardinal having second thoughts.\n\nD100 TABLE: Reform Cardinals' Collective Response\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nRapid fracturing. The coalition that knelt together does not survive the first week. Condulmer's visible suffering creates sympathy. Whispered concerns about \"Spanish influence\" spread. Three or four cardinals quietly distance themselves, citing \"need for reflection\" or \"procedural concerns.\" Capranica—ever the calculator—notices the wavering and hedges his own position. Only Albergati and one or two others remain fully committed. Eugenius faces divided College rather than united support.\n6-15\nSymbolic without substance. The cardinals maintain their public commitment but provide little practical help. They attend ceremonies, make appropriate statements, express support in general terms. But when Parentucelli needs specific assistance—access to records, pressure on reluctant officials, decisions on difficult cases—the cardinals are unavailable, noncommittal, or defer to others. The reform proceeds on Juan's strength and Parentucelli's determination, not cardinal support.\n16-25\nPassive support, active hedging. Most cardinals support the reform enough to not obstruct it, but not enough to risk anything for it. They watch Condulmer's grievance with sympathy. They listen to concerns from officials whose arrangements are disrupted. They privately express doubts while publicly maintaining commitment. If the reform succeeds, they will claim credit. If it falters, they will claim they had reservations all along.\n26-40\nUneven commitment. The eight cardinals split into tiers. Albergati and two others provide genuine, active support—attending meetings, advising Parentucelli, using influence to help. Capranica and two others provide political cover but avoid heavy lifting. Two or three remain nominal supporters who contribute nothing. The reform has some cardinal support but not unified backing. Progress is possible but slower than it could be.\n41-55\nAdequate support. Most cardinals follow through on their public commitment at a basic level. They attend relevant meetings. They answer questions. They don't obstruct. They provide the institutional legitimacy the reform needs. But they don't go beyond what's required. The enthusiasm of the golden moment has faded to dutiful compliance. Enough to proceed, not enough to accelerate.\n56-70\nSolid commitment. The public pledge translates into genuine support. Albergati provides spiritual leadership, framing the reform as divine mandate. Capranica provides political skill, managing relationships with wavering colleagues. Others contribute according to their abilities. The College of Cardinals functions as ally rather than obstacle. Condulmer's grievance remains but doesn't spread. The reform has the institutional backing it needs.\n71-80\nActive partnership. The cardinals who knelt take ownership of the reform. They don't just support Parentucelli—they advocate for him. They use their networks to ease implementation. They counsel Eugenius on managing resistance. They present united front to wavering colleagues. Capranica proves particularly valuable—his political skills now serve reform rather than calculation. The College becomes genuine partner in transformation.\n81-90\nExceeding expectations. The cardinals surprise everyone—perhaps including themselves. The golden moment planted something real. Albergati's tears were genuine, and his conviction spreads. Capranica discovers that being on the right side feels different than being on the winning side. The College does not merely support reform but drives it forward. Cardinals who wavered are brought back into fold by peer pressure from committed colleagues. Condulmer's grievance finds no purchase.\n91-95\nTransformative leadership. The Reform Cardinals become the reform's engine. They propose additional measures Parentucelli hadn't considered. They volunteer for difficult tasks. They take personal risks to advance implementation. Cardinal Albergati—ancient, contemplative Albergati—delivers a sermon that becomes the reform's theological foundation. The movement that began with Juan's oath and Eugenius's courage becomes genuinely owned by the College itself.\n96-100\nHistoric unity. Something unprecedented: a College of Cardinals genuinely united in purpose. Even cardinals who didn't kneel initially approach their colleagues, asking how they can help. Condulmer's grievance dissolves when multiple cardinals reach out to include him, honoring his family relationship while acknowledging the reform's necessity. The reform becomes not Juan's project or Eugenius's project but the Church's project—owned collectively by those who lead her. This is the foundation for lasting change.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

The cardinals who knelt in the golden moment are not following through. The reform now depends heavily on:\n- Juan's military backing\n- Parentucelli's determination\n- External support (Orsini, Medici)\n\nBut the College itself—the institution that should sustain reform after Juan leaves—is not committed.\n\nCombined with Condulmer's bitter grievance, this creates a problematic internal situation.

Do what's required, nothing more. Don't invest in outcome.\n\nIncreased commitment — The success so far, the external support, the apparent momentum—perhaps this will actually work. Begin to believe. Move from obedience to conviction.\n\nQuiet hedging — The internal Church support is weak. Condulmer is wounded. Cardinals aren't helping. Begin to hedge—maintain relationships with reform skeptics, preserve options if this fails.\n\nActive concern — Approach Eugenius or Juan with practical concerns: the men who fled, the cardinals who aren't helping, the security gaps. Professional assessment, not obstruction.\n\nSeek clearer protection — The initial promise was vague. Now that he's committed and visible, demand more specific guarantees. What happens to him when Juan sails east?\n\nQuiet coordination with waverers — The reform has internal problems. Perhaps align with Condulmer, with unenthusiastic cardinals, with others who have doubts. Build alternative network.\n\nFull conversion to cause — The extraordinary Mass, the apparent divine favor, the momentum—perhaps this is genuine. Become true believer and active champion.\n\nKEY CALCULATION:\nPallavicini is watching carefully. He sees external success (Orsini, French, Medici cooperating) but internal weakness (Condulmer wounded, cardinals passive). He's a professional who has survived Vatican politics for years. What does his survival instinct tell him now?\n\nThe most dangerous scenario: Pallavicini concludes the reform will fail when Juan leaves, and begins quietly positioning himself for that outcome while publicly remaining obedient.\n\nThe best scenario: The overwhelming external support convinces him the reform will succeed, and he shifts from obedience to conviction.\n\nD100 TABLE: Captain Pallavicini's Evolving Stance\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nQuiet betrayal preparation. Pallavicini has watched the cardinals fail to follow through and the Pope's nephew withdraw in bitterness. He concludes this reform will collapse when Juan leaves. He begins quietly—very quietly—maintaining relationships with potential opposition. He remains publicly obedient but is preparing for the reform's failure. If discovered, this would be devastating. If not discovered, he becomes a hidden vulnerability.\n6-15\nGrowing doubt. The internal problems trouble Pallavicini. Condulmer's grievance, passive cardinals, escaped officials—these are warning signs he recognizes from years of Vatican service. He continues his duty but his heart isn't in it. His men sense his uncertainty. The guards perform adequately but without energy. Small things begin to slip—delayed responses, incomplete reports, opportunities missed.\n16-25\nUnchanged professional obedience. Pallavicini continues exactly as before—following orders, doing his duty, taking no initiative, risking nothing. He neither helps nor hinders beyond what's required. The Camera remains secured. Guard functions continue. But he offers nothing extra, and when complications arise, he waits for instructions rather than acting. Adequate, not excellent.\n26-40\nCautious but stable. Pallavicini notes the internal problems but also notes the external support. He concludes the situation is genuinely uncertain—could go either way. He continues his duty with slightly more engagement than before, reasoning that active competence serves him regardless of outcome. He's not committed, but he's not hedging either. Professional wait-and-see.\n41-55\nPragmatic increased engagement. The external support impresses Pallavicini. Orsini cooperating, Medici providing records, French faction recommending reconciliation—powerful forces are aligning with reform. Perhaps this will succeed. He begins to invest more—offering observations, suggesting security improvements, anticipating problems rather than just responding. Still professional rather than convinced, but more actively professional.\n56-70\nGrowing confidence. Pallavicini decides the reform is more likely to succeed than fail. Juan's strength, the external cooperation, the Pope's commitment—these outweigh the internal weaknesses. He begins to act like a man who expects to be on the winning side. His guards' performance improves. He volunteers useful information about Vatican operations. He's not a true believer, but he's a confident professional backing what he thinks will win.\n71-80\nActive partnership. Something shifts in Pallavicini. Perhaps the Mass affected him more than he admitted. Perhaps the external support is overwhelming. Perhaps he simply recognizes competent leadership when he sees it. He approaches Parentucelli with practical assistance: security assessments, observations about which officials behave suspiciously, suggestions for protecting key locations. He's becoming an asset, not just an instrument.\n81-90\nGenuine commitment. The professional soldier finds something to believe in. Pallavicini has served corrupt and mediocre popes, navigated cynical Vatican politics, watched good men destroyed and bad men thrive. And now—perhaps for the first time—he's part of something that might actually be righteous. He commits fully. His guards notice the change. Vatican security becomes genuinely excellent. He's no longer following orders; he's serving a cause.\n91-95\nUnexpected initiative. Pallavicini takes action beyond his orders. He identifies a security vulnerability—perhaps officials communicating with those who fled, perhaps documents being moved secretly, perhaps a threat to Parentucelli he's detected. He addresses it without waiting for instructions, then reports what he did and why. This is the behavior of a man who has fully invested in the reform's success—taking risks, showing initiative, treating the cause as his own.\n96-100\nTransformation and revelation. Pallavicini becomes not just committed but invaluable. Years of Vatican service have taught him things—patterns, secrets, vulnerabilities. He brings this knowledge to Juan and Parentucelli: \"There are things I've seen that I never reported because reporting them was dangerous. Now I will tell you.\" His information fills gaps, identifies threats, reveals opportunities. The professional soldier becomes the reform's unexpected intelligence asset.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

When Juan sails for Constantinople, the internal rot may consume what the external support built.\n\nFACTION 9: Council of Basel / Cardinal Louis d'Allemand\n\nWHO HE IS:\n\nCardinal Louis d'Allemand (Aleman), French, leader of the radical conciliarist faction at Basel\n\nThe most powerful voice pushing for absolute conciliar supremacy over the Pope\n\nCommands 60-80 committed supporters at Basel—enough to obstruct, not enough to command alone\n\nHas been waging procedural warfare for years, blocking progress to force constitutional crisis\n\nHis goal: establish that councils are permanently superior to popes, based on Haec Sancta from Constance\n\nTHE COUNCIL'S STRUCTURE:\n\nFour deputations: Prelates, Doctors, Canons, Lower Clergy\n\nEach must reach internal consensus before advancing matters\n\nGeneral congregation requires three of four deputations to agree\n\nSingle reform decrees can take six months from proposal to passage\n\nD'Allemand's faction uses this structure to obstruct anything that doesn't serve their constitutional agenda\n\nWHAT BASEL KNOWS:\n\nRochetaillée's message is traveling to Basel right now\n\nBut Rochetaillée rolled 99—he's recommending reconciliation, declaring victory, offering to bridge Rome and Basel\n\nThis is NOT the message d'Allemand expected\n\nOther messages will also arrive—from Colonna (fled, sending \"concerns\"), from neutral observers, from various agents\n\nThe news will reach Basel within 1-2 weeks\n\nTHE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS:\n\nEugenius adopted Basel's reforms motu proprio—on his own authority\n\nThis is exactly what Juan proposed in the Declaration of Como: parallel legislation\n\nThe reforms pass, but Rome claims independent authority, not submission to Council\n\nThe Camera reform happened entirely without Council consultation\n\nIf this works, it proves the Pope CAN reform independently—making Basel less necessary\n\nD'ALLEMAND'S POSITION:\n\nHis years of procedural warfare may have been rendered irrelevant\n\nThe reforms he claimed to champion have been achieved—by Rome, not Basel\n\nRochetaillée—his own man in Rome—is recommending reconciliation\n\nIf Basel declares victory and reconciles, d'Allemand's radical agenda dies\n\nIf Basel denounces this as illegitimate, they look like they oppose reform itself\n\nHIS CAPABILITIES:\n\nDominates Basel's procedural machinery\n\n60-80 committed supporters\n\nFrench crown backing (King Charles VII)\n\nCanonical expertise to challenge anything\n\nAbility to declare Eugenius's actions illegitimate\n\nCould push for papal deposition (Constance precedent)\n\nCould elect rival pope, creating new schism\n\nCould simply obstruct any reconciliation indefinitely\n\nHIS REALISTIC OPTIONS:\n\nDeclare victory, accept reconciliation — The reforms passed. Claim this as Council's achievement. End the constitutional conflict. (This kills his radical agenda but preserves peace.)\n\nDenounce as illegitimate coercion — \"The Pope acted with Spanish sword at his throat. These reforms are void because coerced.\" (Ignores Rochetaillée's recommendation.)\n\nDenounce as papal usurpation — \"Rome stole our reforms to make Basel irrelevant. We must reassert Council authority.\" (Escalates constitutional crisis.)\n\nDemand Council ratification — \"The reforms are acceptable in substance, but must be submitted to Council for proper approval.\" (Procedural middle ground.)\n\nMove toward deposition — \"Eugenius has proven he cannot be trusted. The Council must consider whether a new pope is needed.\" (Extreme escalation.)\n\nSplit the difference — Accept the reform decrees Basel already passed, reject the Camera reform as ultra vires (beyond authority), demand consultation going forward.\n\nWait and observe — Don't commit immediately. See how events develop. Gather more information before deciding.\n\nKEY CALCULATION:\nD'Allemand faces a terrible choice. His own agent (Rochetaillée) recommends reconciliation. The reforms he claimed to want have been achieved. If he accepts this, his radical constitutional agenda dies—but the Church is reformed and united.\n\nIf he rejects this, he looks like a man who wanted power more than reform. He can still cause tremendous damage—obstruction, possible schism, rival pope—but at the cost of appearing to oppose the very reforms he championed.\n\nHis French backers (King Charles VII) may also have opinions. French interests are complex—they want influence over the Church, but do they want schism?\n\nThe Castilian delegation at Basel (Fray Hernando, Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena) will also react to this news. They've been building bridges for months. How does d'Allemand's response affect them?\n\nD100 TABLE: Cardinal d'Allemand and Basel's Response\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nSchismatic fury. D'Allemand rejects Rochetaillée's recommendation contemptuously. He denounces the Rome events as Spanish tyranny, declares Eugenius's actions void, and begins pushing for papal deposition. The radical faction mobilizes. Basel moves toward electing a rival pope. The Church faces its worst nightmare—a new schism born from reform itself. Juan's achievement becomes the catalyst for catastrophe.\n6-15\nAggressive rejection. D'Allemand frames Rome's actions as illegitimate usurpation. \"The Pope has stolen our reforms to destroy conciliar authority. We must not accept this fraud.\" He blocks any reconciliation, demands Eugenius submit the Camera reform for Council approval, and threatens consequences if Rome ignores Basel. The constitutional conflict escalates sharply. No schism yet, but the path toward it opens.\n16-25\nHostile obstruction. D'Allemand cannot accept reconciliation, but isn't ready for open rupture. He uses Basel's procedural machinery to delay any response—demanding committees, consultations, formal debates. Months pass with no decision. The Council neither accepts nor rejects. Rome and Basel remain in limbo. The reform proceeds in Rome but lacks broader Church legitimacy.\n26-35\nGrudging minimalism. D'Allemand accepts the reform decrees Basel already passed (pluralism, concubinage, annates) as vindication of Council authority. But he rejects the Camera reform as ultra vires—done without Council consultation, therefore illegitimate. He demands future reforms require Council approval. A partial, hostile accommodation that preserves conflict over core constitutional questions.\n36-50\nDivided Council. D'Allemand pushes for rejection, but Rochetaillée's recommendation and the Castilian delegation's influence create genuine debate. Basel splits—radicals versus moderates. Months of procedural warfare follow. Eventually, a compromise emerges: Basel \"acknowledges\" Rome's reforms without \"approving\" them, preserving both positions. Constitutional question remains unresolved but immediate crisis avoided.\n51-60\nReluctant acceptance. The combination of Rochetaillée's conversion, moderate pressure, and practical reality forces d'Allemand to accept what he cannot change. Basel formally \"welcomes\" the adoption of its reform decrees, though d'Allemand ensures the language preserves Council claims. The Camera reform is accepted as \"papal household matter\" outside Council jurisdiction. Face saved, reconciliation possible, radical agenda weakened.\n61-70\nStrategic retreat. D'Allemand recognizes he cannot win this battle. He accepts reconciliation publicly while privately preserving his network for future constitutional struggles. Basel declares the reform decrees vindication of conciliar principles. Rome and Basel enter period of cooperation. But d'Allemand waits—if the reform fails, if Juan's protection wavers, the constitutional question will return.\n71-80\nGenuine reconsideration. Rochetaillée's conversion, the evidence of Camera corruption, the sight of actual reform happening—these give d'Allemand pause. Perhaps the constitutional question matters less than actual reform. Perhaps cooperation achieves more than conflict. He moves Basel toward genuine reconciliation, not just tactical acceptance. The Council sends delegation to Rome to coordinate implementation.\n81-90\nUnexpected statesmanship. D'Allemand surprises everyone—perhaps including himself. He addresses the Council: \"We sought reform. Reform has been achieved. The method was irregular, but the substance is what we demanded. Let us declare victory and work with Rome rather than against her.\" He subordinates his constitutional agenda to the Church's actual good. Basel moves decisively toward reconciliation.\n91-95\nHistoric bridge-building. D'Allemand proposes something unprecedented: a joint Rome-Basel commission to oversee reform implementation. Council representatives working alongside papal officials. Shared responsibility, shared credit, shared authority. This sidesteps the constitutional question by creating practical cooperation. If it works, it becomes model for future Church governance. The radical becomes the reconciler.\n96-100\nTransformation. The impossible: Cardinal d'Allemand, champion of conciliar supremacy, recognizes that his cause was becoming an obstacle to the Church he claimed to serve. He publicly acknowledges that Rome's reforms vindicate conciliar principles in substance if not in form. He proposes Basel formally endorse Eugenius's actions and declare the constitutional conflict ended. He offers to travel to Rome personally to seal reconciliation. The architect of division becomes the architect of unity.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

The French cardinal, who spent eight years fighting for conciliar supremacy, asks Juan directly what he truly wants.

Roll 43 (The Walls Crack): Rochetaillee is deeply affected but cannot fully surrender his wariness. He admits Juan does not fit his political categories and that he is beginning to believe Juan is genuine. He raises three substantive concerns about the reform: Parentucelli answering only to the Pope lacks external accountability, the amnesty may protect those who stole crusade funds, and the reform depends entirely on Juan's presence. Rochetaillee reports on the consistory: passive acceptance, no conviction, Condulmer's bitter confrontation with his uncle. He warns about the 'hollow center' of internal support. He advises Juan to address Condulmer's grievance before it festers. Juan invites continued collaboration. Rochetaillee pledges to write to Cardinal d'Allemand at Basel recommending reconciliation, and agrees to work toward building the 'house of the Lord' together.",

This is excellent thinking—the recipient's reaction depends on what message they actually receive.\n\nWHAT BASEL WILL RECEIVE:\n\nRochetaillée's letter (Roll 99) — Recommending reconciliation, declaring victory, offering to bridge Rome and Basel.

Their initial dramatic gesture of kneeling now feels less certain. Spanish political interference could become a focal point of skepticism, with Pallavicini's visible uncertainty potentially undermining the fragile reconciliation. The meeting's success hinges on managing these underlying doubts and maintaining the momentum of the spiritual breakthrough.\n\nYou're right—let's return to the narrative and see how events unfold. The faction rolls give us the landscape; now we play within it.\n\nTHE CONSISTORY MEETING\n\nLocation: Vatican consistory chamber\nPresent: Pope Eugenius IV, approximately 11 cardinals\nContext:\n\nWhat we know from the rolls:\n\nColonna: Absent (fled Rome)\n\nOrsini: Present, cooperating (Roll 82)\n\nRochetaillée + French allies: Present, moving toward reconciliation (Roll 99)\n\nCondulmer: Unknown—wounded, withdrawn, but is he attending?\n\nThe 8 who knelt: Present, but commitment is symbolic not substantive (Roll 9)\n\nAlbergati: Genuinely committed, but 70 years old and contemplative\n\nCapranica: Political calculator, started the applause, but will he follow through?\n\nWhat must be discussed:\n\nImplementation of reforms\n\nParentucelli's authority and support\n\nLetters to Basel and other courts\n\nColonna's flight—what does it mean?\n\nSecurity arrangements going forward\n\nThe Spanish question—Juan's role, his knights, his eventual departure\n\nCardinal Condulmer's position\n\nThe atmosphere:\nThe extraordinary Mass is hours old. The golden light has faded. Now comes the cold work of governance. Cardinals who knelt in transcendent moment must now commit to practical action—or find reasons not to.\n\nSITUATION ANALYSIS:\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nThe Mass was genuinely extraordinary—memories are fresh\n\nRochetaillée's unexpected conversion removes French opposition\n\nOrsini is actively cooperating\n\nThe reforms are signed—this is implementation, not debate\n\nExternal support (Medici, fled Colonna) strengthens Eugenius's hand\n\nJuan's 591 knights remain in Rome\n\nComplication Factors:\n\nCardinals who knelt are not following through (Roll 9)\n\nCondulmer's bitter confrontation with his uncle\n\nPallavicini's growing doubt may be known to Vatican insiders\n\nSome corrupt officials escaped—gaps in evidence\n\nCardinals may raise \"concerns\" that mask reluctance\n\nThe Spanish question: what happens when Juan leaves?\n\nEugenius must manage this alone—Juan is not present\n\nThe Key Dynamic:\nEugenius must convert the Mass's emotional commitment into practical action from cardinals who are already wavering. He has Rochetaillée's unexpected support and Orsini's cooperation. But he also has a wounded nephew, passive supporters, and the knowledge that his internal base is weaker than it appeared in St. Peter's.\n\nD100 TABLE: The Consistory Meeting\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCollapse of momentum. The meeting goes badly from the start. Condulmer appears, visibly wounded, and his presence poisons the atmosphere. Cardinals who knelt begin raising \"concerns\"—proper procedures, Spanish influence, the need for \"reflection.\" Rochetaillée's conciliatory stance is dismissed as capitulation. By the end, Eugenius faces a College that has retreated from its public commitment. The reform has legal force but no institutional support. Implementation will be a constant battle.\n6-15\nWounded resistance. Condulmer's grievance spreads sympathy through the room. Cardinals who knelt express support in principle but raise practical objections to every specific proposal. \"We support reform, but...\" becomes the refrain. Rochetaillée's bridge-building is politely acknowledged but not embraced. Eugenius emerges with nominal agreement but no enthusiasm. The cardinals will not obstruct openly, but they will not help either. Everything depends on Parentucelli and Juan.\n16-25\nProcedural quicksand. The cardinals agree the reforms are good but insist on proper process for implementation. Committees must be formed. Consultations must occur. Procedures must be followed. Weeks of meetings are proposed before any action. This is not opposition—it is the Vatican's natural defense mechanism, burying change in process. Eugenius can push through, but only by overriding his own College repeatedly.\n26-40\nPassive acceptance. The cardinals accept what they cannot change. Colonna fled; resistance seems futile. They agree to Eugenius's proposals without enthusiasm. They will not obstruct Parentucelli, but they will not assist him either. The meeting concludes with formal agreement and informal disengagement. The reform has the College's acquiescence, not its support. Adequate for proceeding; insufficient for thriving.\n41-55\nMixed engagement. The College splits visibly. Albergati and one or two others offer genuine support and practical suggestions. Capranica positions himself carefully—helpful on some points, cautious on others. The French cardinals, following Rochetaillée's lead, are surprisingly constructive. But several cardinals remain passive, and Condulmer's wounded absence (or wounded presence) casts a shadow. Eugenius has partial support—enough to proceed, not enough to feel secure.\n56-65\nRochetaillée's intervention. The meeting begins uncertainly, but Rochetaillée's unexpected stance changes the dynamic. When he speaks in favor of reconciliation—the French faction leader endorsing papal reform—other cardinals take notice. His conversion provides cover for those who want to support but feared appearing to capitulate. The meeting gains momentum. Practical discussions begin. Not unanimous enthusiasm, but genuine engagement.\n66-75\nOrsini's contribution. Cardinal Orsini shares intelligence about Camera corruption—information he's gathered through cooperation with Parentucelli. The specifics shock cardinals who knew vaguely but not precisely how bad things were. The revelation shifts the meeting's tone from \"should we support this\" to \"how do we fix this.\" Practical planning begins. Several cardinals volunteer for specific tasks. The reform gains working support.\n76-85\nGenuine coalition forming. Rochetaillée's bridge-building, Orsini's intelligence, and Albergati's moral authority combine to create real momentum. Cardinals begin competing to demonstrate commitment rather than competing to raise objections. Capranica's political instincts tell him this is the winning side—he becomes actively helpful. Concrete implementation plans emerge. The College begins functioning as partner rather than obstacle.\n86-95\nUnexpected unity. Something of the Mass's spirit carries into the consistory. Rochetaillée proposes practical cooperation between Rome and Basel. Orsini provides valuable intelligence freely. Even cardinals who seemed passive find ways to contribute. Condulmer's grievance is addressed—other cardinals reach out to include him, honoring his dignity while supporting reform. The meeting produces not just agreement but genuine collaborative planning.\n96-100\nTransformation sustained. The golden moment does not fade. Cardinal Albergati offers a prayer that moves the room to tears. Rochetaillée's conversion inspires others to examine their own consciences. Even Condulmer, approached with genuine care by his colleagues, begins to soften. The consistory becomes not a political meeting but a spiritual renewal. The College of Cardinals commits itself—genuinely, collectively—to the reform's success. This is the foundation for lasting change.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

Adequate for proceeding; insufficient for thriving.\"\n\nSo the meeting with the cardinals produces passive acceptance - not opposition, but not real support either. This fits with our earlier rolls about the Reform Cardinals (9 - symbolic without substance) and adds to the picture of weak internal support.\n\nNow Juan is waiting with his knights, making himself available. I should:\n1. Describe the scene of Juan waiting\n2. Potentially have someone approach him\n3. Set up the narrative for what comes next\n\nGiven the faction rolls, several people might want to speak with Juan:\n- Orsini (cooperating, might want to build relationship)\n- Rochetaillée (converting, might want to offer bridge to Basel)\n- Medici representative (partnership, might want to formalize relationship)\n- Parentucelli (might need guidance or support)\n- Eugenius (after the consistory, to report)\n\nI should play this out naturally, stopping when Juan needs to make decisions or respond.\n\nLet me also remember the NPC rules the player specified:\n- NPC has their own agenda. They steer the conversation toward it.\n- NPC does not explain themselves. Juan must figure them out.\n- NPC does not help Juan without getting something first.\n- Before NPC dialogue, answer: What does this NPC want? What won't they say?\n\nLet me craft a scene where Juan waits, and someone approaches him. Given the rolls, Rochetaillée's approach makes narrative sense - he's having a genuine conversion and wants to bridge Rome and Basel. This is a significant NPC interaction.\n\nCONSISTORY RESULT: 35 — Passive Acceptance\n\nThe cardinals accept what they cannot change. Colonna fled; resistance seems futile. They agree to Eugenius's proposals without enthusiasm. They will not obstruct Parentucelli, but they will not assist him either. The meeting concludes with formal agreement and informal disengagement. The reform has the College's acquiescence, not its support. Adequate for proceeding; insufficient for thriving.\n\nLate Afternoon — March 23, 1434\nVatican Courtyard, Near St. Peter's\n\nThe Roman sun has begun its descent, casting long shadows across the flagstones where your knights have assembled in loose formation. They've been fed—bread, cheese, and watered wine provided by Vatican servants who eye them with a mixture of fear and fascination. The men are in good spirits, though restless. They've witnessed something extraordinary and now they wait, unsure what comes next.\n\nMarco Tornesi approaches you, wiping crumbs from his weathered face.\n\n\"The men are asking, Majestad. Do we stay? Do we return to the ships? Some are wondering if there'll be fighting.\" He glances toward the Vatican buildings where cardinals have been closeted for hours. \"They're ready if there is.\"\n\nYou tell him to hold position. Wait for word.\n\nThe afternoon stretches. Servants come and go. Occasionally a minor cleric scurries past, carefully not meeting your eyes. The Vatican has the feel of a beehive after someone has struck it—activity, anxiety, purpose, but no one quite sure where the danger lies.\n\nA Visitor\n\nAn hour before sunset, a figure emerges from the Vatican and walks directly toward you. Not a servant. Not a guard. A cardinal in scarlet robes, moving with deliberate purpose.\n\nCardinal Jean de Rochetaillée.\n\nThe French faction leader. The man who remained seated while others knelt. The man who reports to d'Allemand at Basel.\n\nHe approaches alone, without attendants—unusual for a prince of the Church. His thin face is difficult to read. He stops at a respectful distance and inclines his head.\n\n\"Your Majesty. I wonder if you might spare a moment for conversation.\"\n\nHis Castilian is accented but fluent. His eyes are sharp, assessing.\n\nNPC ANALYSIS — Cardinal Rochetaillée\n\nWhat does he want?\n\nTo position himself as bridge between Rome and Basel (per his roll: 99)\n\nTo understand Juan directly—not through reports, not through intermediaries\n\nTo gauge whether reconciliation is genuinely possible or whether Juan seeks Spanish domination\n\nTo secure his own position in whatever new order emerges\n\nWhat won't he say?\n\nThat he's already sent a message to Basel recommending reconciliation (this is his leverage—he can still change it)\n\nHow deeply his conversion goes—is it genuine, or strategic repositioning?\n\nHis assessment of Eugenius's internal weakness (the passive cardinals, wounded Condulmer)\n\nWhat the French crown's reaction might be to his changed stance\n\nThe cardinal waits, hands folded in his robes, for your response."

          "text": "Juan is addressing Cardinal Rochetaillée in French - \"Bien, mon cardinale\" - a polite acknowledgment of the French cardinal's nationality. This is a smart diplomatic touch.\n\nRochetaillée has rolled 99 - genuine conversion. He's recommending reconciliation with Basel and offering to serve as a bridge. But Juan doesn't know this yet. From Juan's perspective, Rochetaillée was one of the cardinals who remained seated during the Mass, part of the French faction that reports everything to Basel.\n\nThis is a significant encounter. Rochetaillée is essentially coming to offer his services, but he'll want to assess Juan first. He's a political animal - even genuine conversion doesn't mean he's naive.\n\nLet me play Rochetaillée according to:\n1. His roll (99 - genuine conversion, but still intelligent and cautious)\n2. NPC rules: He has his own agenda, steers conversation toward it, doesn't explain himself, doesn't help without getting something first\n3. What he wants: to position himself as bridge, understand Juan directly, gauge if reconciliation is possible, secure his position\n4. What he won't say: that he's already sent reconciliation message, how deep his conversion goes, his assessment of Eugenius's weakness, French crown reaction\n\nI should stop after Rochetaillée speaks and asks something or makes a point, letting Juan respond.\n\nRochetaillée's expression flickers—surprise, perhaps, at the French. A small acknowledgment of his origins that could be courtesy or could be calculation. With kings, it is difficult to tell.\n\n\"Your Majesty is gracious.\"\n\nHe glances at the knights nearby—close enough to intervene, far enough for private conversation. He makes no move to suggest greater privacy. This will be conducted in the open, it seems. Perhaps that is the point.\n\n\"I will not waste your time with pleasantries,\" he begins, his voice pitched low. \"We both know who I am. We both know what faction I have served these past years at Basel. We both know I did not kneel this morning.\"\n\nHe pauses, letting that sit between you.\n\n\"And yet I am here. Speaking with you. Not sending ciphered letters to Cardinal d'Allemand about Spanish tyranny and coerced popes.\" A thin smile that does not reach his eyes. \"You may wonder why.\"\n\nHe turns slightly, looking out across the courtyard, toward Rome beyond the Vatican walls.\n\n\"I have spent eight years fighting for conciliar supremacy. Eight years of procedural warfare, of canonical arguments, of building coalitions against papal excess. I believed—I still believe—that the Church requires accountability, that no man should hold unchecked power, that councils exist for a reason.\"\n\nHe turns back to you.\n\n\"And then this morning, I watched a pope weep while confessing his failures. I watched him sign reforms we spent years demanding. I watched a foreign king kneel and swear to defend the Church without asking for a single benefice, a single title, a single florin in return.\"\n\nHis eyes search your face.\n\n\"I find myself uncertain what to believe, Your Majesty. So I came to ask you directly, because I have learned that secondhand reports are worth less than a moment of honest conversation.\"\n\nHe folds his arms.\n\n\"What do you actually want? Not the speech you gave in St. Peter's—I heard that. I want to know what Juan of Castile wants from this Church he has sworn to protect.\""

This is informal, warm, treating him as a fellow man not a cardinal\n- Spoke of deeply personal things - children, happiness, friendship, praising God\n- No political demands, no conditions, no positioning\n- Invited collaboration as equals - \"shall we work together\"\n- Called him \"father\" - respecting his clerical status while being warm\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- Juan's response is exactly the kind of genuine faith that moved Eugenius (roll 93)\n- Rochetaillée is already predisposed toward conversion (roll 99)\n- The informality may disarm a man used to Vatican politics\n- No agenda, no demands - just invitation\n- Consistent with Juan's character throughout - this is clearly genuine\n\n**Complication Factors:**\n- Rochetaillée is a political operator - he may suspect manipulation\n- The response is almost TOO simple - where's the catch?\n- Physical informality may be seen as presumption by a French cardinal\n- He came expecting negotiation, got... this\n- Eight years of cynicism don't vanish instantly\n\n**The key question:**\nDoes Rochetaillée recognize genuine faith when he sees it? Or does his political training make him suspicious of anything that seems too good to be true?\n \nWith his extraordinary roll of 99, the path to genuine connection seems almost certain. His political instincts, honed over years of ecclesiastical maneuvering, momentarily dissolve in the face of Juan's raw, unfiltered sincerity. The encounter transforms from a potential negotiation to a profound spiritual moment, where institutional barriers crumble and human connection emerges triumphant.\n\nNPC ANALYSIS — Rochetaillée's Reaction\n\nWhat just happened:\n\nPhysical touch—informal, warm, treating him as a man, not a cardinal\n\nNo political demands, no conditions, no positioning\n\nDeeply personal framing: children, happiness, friendship, praising God\n\nInvitation to collaboration as equals: \"shall we work together\"\n\nCalled him \"father\"—respecting his clerical status while being familiar\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nJuan's response mirrors exactly what moved Eugenius (Roll 93)\n\nRochetaillée is already predisposed toward conversion (Roll 99)\n\nThe simplicity is disarming—no agenda to parse, no trap to detect\n\nPhysical warmth breaks through Vatican formality\n\nConsistent with everything Rochetaillée has observed—this is clearly genuine\n\nHe came expecting negotiation; he received invitation\n\nComplication Factors:\n\nEight years of political warfare create instinctive suspicion\n\nThe response is almost too simple—where is the catch?\n\nPhysical informality may feel presumptuous to a French cardinal\n\nHis political training screams that no one acts without agenda\n\nIf he accepts this at face value and is wrong, he is destroyed\n\nThe Key Question:\nRochetaillée rolled 99—he is already moving toward genuine conversion. But conversion is a process, not a moment. Does Juan's directness complete what the Mass began? Or does a lifetime of cynicism demand more proof?\n\nD100 TABLE: Rochetaillée's Response to Juan\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCynicism resurfaces. The physical touch, the simple words, the invitation—it is too easy. Too perfect. Rochetaillée's political instincts scream warning. He has seen men destroyed by trusting what seemed genuine. He withdraws slightly, his expression closing. \"Your Majesty speaks beautifully. But I have heard beautiful speeches before.\" He will still recommend reconciliation to Basel—but he will not trust Juan personally. The bridge remains incomplete.\n6-15\nGuarded interest. Rochetaillée is moved but cannot fully surrender his wariness. \"The house of the Lord,\" he repeats slowly. \"Yes. That is what we should be building.\" He does not reject the invitation, but neither does he embrace it. He will watch. He will wait. If Juan's actions match his words over time, perhaps trust will follow. For now, cautious alignment rather than genuine partnership.\n16-25\nIntellectual acceptance. Rochetaillée recognizes authenticity but processes it through his political mind. \"You mean this,\" he says—statement, not question. \"I did not expect that.\" He accepts the invitation to work together, but frames it in practical terms: what specifically can they accomplish, what obstacles exist, what is the path forward. The heart remains guarded; the head engages.\n26-40\nWarming respect. The shoulder-slap surprised him. The words surprised him more. Rochetaillée finds himself smiling despite himself—a small, reluctant expression. \"God's kingdom on earth. Children growing happy. You make it sound simple, Your Majesty.\" A pause. \"Perhaps it should be simple. Perhaps we have made it complicated.\" He extends his hand. \"Yes. Let us work together, and see what we can build.\" A genuine beginning, if not yet full trust.\n41-55\nThe walls crack. Something in Juan's directness—the physical warmth, the absence of agenda, the vision of children and happiness—reaches past Rochetaillée's defenses. He is quiet for a long moment. \"I have spent eight years building walls,\" he says finally. \"Between Rome and Basel. Between factions. Between men who should be brothers.\" He looks at Juan with something new in his eyes. \"Perhaps it is time to build something else.\" The conversion deepens.\n56-70\nGenuine connection. Rochetaillée laughs—an unexpected sound, startling nearby knights. \"God's kingdom on earth,\" he repeats. \"Do you know, Your Majesty, I cannot remember the last time someone answered a political question with theology and meant it.\" He grips Juan's arm in return. \"Yes, father, I will work with you. And perhaps you will teach an old cardinal to remember why he took holy orders in the first place.\" Real warmth enters the relationship.\n71-80\nConfession unlocked. Juan's openness unlocks something in Rochetaillée. \"I came here to assess you,\" he admits. \"To determine whether reconciliation was wise or foolish. To protect myself regardless of outcome.\" He shakes his head. \"And you speak of children and happiness and the house of the Lord, and I find I have no response except... yes. Yes, that is what matters.\" He asks if they might pray together before he leaves.\n81-90\nTransformation witnessed. The cardinal who spent eight years fighting for institutional power over spiritual renewal finds himself undone by simple faith. His eyes glisten. \"Your Majesty—Juan—I have been a fool. A clever fool, but a fool nonetheless.\" His voice drops. \"I told myself I fought for accountability, for proper governance. But somewhere I forgot what the Church exists to do.\" He grips both of Juan's hands. \"Thank you. For reminding me.\"\n91-95\nPartnership forged. This is not merely acceptance—it is commitment. Rochetaillée sees in Juan what he once hoped to see in himself: genuine faith expressed through action. \"I will write to d'Allemand tonight,\" he says. \"Not recommending reconciliation—demanding it. And I will tell him why: because I have met a king who wants nothing except God's kingdom, and if we cannot work with such a man, we do not deserve to call ourselves servants of Christ.\" An alliance is born.\n96-100\nBrother found. The impossible: a French cardinal and a Castilian king, standing in a Roman courtyard, recognizing in each other the same flame. Rochetaillée embraces Juan—cardinal embracing king, protocol shattered. \"I have been alone in this for so long,\" he whispers. \"Fighting, always fighting, and never sure if what I fought for was worth the cost.\" He pulls back, tears on his weathered face. \"You have given me hope, Your Majesty. Not for the Church—for myself. That I might still become what I was called to be.\" A friendship begins that will outlast both their lives.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

He does not pull away. His eyes search your face, looking for the seam, the edge, the place where the mask meets the man beneath.\n\nHe does not find it.\n\n\"God's kingdom on earth,\" he repeats slowly. The words sound different in his mouth—tested, weighed. \"Children growing happy. Singing the Lord's praises.\"\n\nHe exhales, and something in his posture shifts. The rigid formality of a Vatican politician gives way to something older, wearier, more human.\n\n\"I have spent eight years building walls,\" he says quietly. \"Between Rome and Basel. Between factions. Between men who should be brothers in Christ.\" He looks past you, toward the knights in their white tabards, toward the dome of St. Peter's catching the last light of afternoon. \"I told myself it was necessary. That the Church needed protection from papal excess. That I was fighting for something sacred.\"\n\nHis jaw tightens.\n\n\"Perhaps I was. Perhaps I still believe that.\" He meets your eyes again. \"But somewhere in those eight years, I forgot what the Church exists for. It became about winning. About being right. About ensuring that my vision of governance prevailed.\"\n\nHe reaches up and removes your hand from his shoulder—not rejection, but deliberation. He holds it for a moment, examining it as though it might contain answers.\n\n\"You have five hundred knights in this courtyard. You have a pope who owes you everything. You could demand bishoprics, benefices, a cardinal's hat for your confessor, influence over appointments for a generation.\" He releases your hand. \"Instead you speak of children and happiness and building the house of the Lord.\"\n\nA pause. The silence stretches.\n\n\"Either you are the most dangerous man I have ever met,\" he says finally, \"or you are exactly what you appear to be. And I find, to my considerable discomfort, that I am beginning to believe the latter.\"\n\nHe straightens, recovering some of his cardinal's dignity, though it sits differently on him now.\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. Let us work together. Let us see what we can build.\" He pauses. \"But understand—I have believed in things before that proved false. I will watch. I will test. And if you prove to be other than you seem...\"\n\nHe does not finish the threat. He does not need to.\n\n\"What would you have me do? Specifically. For this house of the Lord we are to build together.\"\n\nThe question hangs in the evening air. Behind you, knights murmur quietly among themselves. Somewhere in the Vatican, Eugenius is emerging from a consistory that granted him acquiescence without enthusiasm. Parentucelli labors in the Camera, surrounded by ledgers and frightened clerks. Lucia sails toward Naples with your daughter.\n\nAnd a French cardinal who spent eight years fighting for conciliar supremacy has just asked you for instructions."

          "text": "Juan is asking Rochetaillée for his opinion on the Camera reform decree. This is smart - it treats him as an expert whose opinion matters, not as someone to be instructed. It also tests where he actually stands on the substance.\n\nRochetaillée is a French cardinal who has fought for conciliar supremacy for eight years. He has expertise in Church governance, canon law, and the politics of reform. His faction at Basel pushed for reforms like pluralism, concubinage, annates - but the Camera reform is something different. It was done entirely outside Council authority.\n\nWhat does he actually think about the Camera reform?\n\nFrom his perspective:\n- The reform decrees on pluralism, concubinage, annates - these are what Basel wanted. He should support these.\n- The Camera reform is more complex:\n  - It addresses genuine corruption (which he knows exists)\n  - It was done without Council consultation (which offends conciliar principles)\n  - It creates Parentucelli as Extraordinary Commissioner answerable only to the Pope (centralizing power)\n  - But it also includes transparency measures, quarterly accounts, separation of Camera and College\n  - The amnesty provision is pragmatic but might offend justice-seekers\n\nHe has just had his walls crack (roll 43). He's moving toward trust but still testing, still watching. He won't simply agree with everything - that would be sycophancy. He'll give his honest assessment.\n\nWhat would a thoughtful French conciliarist actually think about the Camera reform?\n\nPositives he'd acknowledge:\n- Addresses real corruption he's observed\n- Transparency measures align with conciliar principles of accountability\n- Separation of Camera and College reduces concentrated power\n- Practical, not merely punitive\n\nConcerns he might raise:\n- Done without Council consultation - sets precedent that Pope can restructure Church governance unilaterally\n- Parentucelli answers only to Pope - no external accountability\n- What happens when Juan leaves? Who enforces this?\n- The amnesty might let truly guilty men escape justice\n \nI'll carefully evaluate the 30-day document surrender deadline. The timeframe seems ambitious, potentially unrealistic given the bureaucratic complexity of Church records. Gathering comprehensive financial documentation across multiple dioceses and administrative centers requires significant logistical coordination. While the intent demonstrates urgency, the practical implementation might strain existing administrative capacities.\n\nRochetaillée tilts his head—a scholar's gesture, considering the question seriously rather than offering empty agreement.\n\n\"You ask my honest opinion, Your Majesty? Not what I think you wish to hear?\"\n\nHe waits for your nod, then begins to pace slowly, hands clasped behind his back. The cardinal as theologian, working through an argument.\n\n\"The reform decrees—pluralism, concubinage, annates—these are what Basel has demanded for years. I cannot oppose them without opposing everything I claimed to fight for. The substance is sound. The motu proprio framing...\" He waves a hand. \"It preserves papal dignity while achieving conciliar goals. I can accept this. D'Allemand will grumble about procedure, but the substance is what matters.\"\n\nHe stops pacing, turning to face you.\n\n\"The Camera reform is more complex.\"\n\nHis eyes sharpen—the political mind engaging fully now.\n\n\"The corruption is real. I have seen it. Every man in Rome with eyes has seen it. Parentucelli's evidence will shock no one who has paid attention. In this, the decree is righteous and necessary.\"\n\nA pause. He chooses his next words carefully.\n\n\"But I have concerns. Not objections—concerns. From a man who has spent eight years thinking about how institutions fail.\"\n\nHe raises a finger.\n\n\"First: Parentucelli answers only to the Pope. No external accountability. This is the very concentration of power that conciliarism exists to check. What happens if the next pope is corrupt? Or the one after? You have created a powerful instrument that depends entirely on the virtue of whoever wields it.\"\n\nA second finger.\n\n\"Second: the amnesty. I understand the logic—unite rather than divide, turn enemies into allies. Mercy as strategy. But some of these men did not merely skim fees. Some stole from the crusade treasury that was meant to save Constantinople. Seventy thousand florins gone in ten months.\" His voice hardens. \"Does forgiveness extend to men whose corruption may cost Christian lives?\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"Third—and this is the question that troubles me most.\" He steps closer, lowering his voice. \"What happens when you leave, Your Majesty? Your five hundred knights are the reform's spine. The Pope's nephew nurses grievance. The cardinals who knelt this morning are already finding reasons to avoid commitment. Pallavicini's guards grow uncertain. I watched the consistory through the eyes of men who report to me—passive acceptance, not conviction.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"You have built something extraordinary. But you have built it on yourself. On your faith, your knights, your will. When you sail for Constantinople—and you will sail, because you are the man you appear to be—what holds this together?\"\n\nHe lets the question hang for a moment.\n\n\"These are not objections, Your Majesty. These are the concerns of a man who has watched reforms fail before. Who has seen good intentions consumed by institutional rot. Who wants this to succeed and fears the ways it might not.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"What is your answer?\""

We could not think of another way to make sure this reform could take root. It will take years to replace the cardinals with those who have offended less. How can we guard against a corrupt pope? A corrupt king? A cardinal? If you know of a better way to put in checks that will not impede the execution of these reforms, Im sure me and the pope will want to hear it.\n\n\nAnd the amnesty only covers the traditional conduct. When Tommaso has taken control and the church has accepted these reforms, he will move against the offenders that have done most harm outside what would be acceptable. The decree does not protect those. Amnesty, but within norms.\n\n\nIf my knights are needed here, I will leave them. I will not just sail away and leave the pope to his fate. These reforms must succeed. So far, it all seems to be going smoothly. How did the meeting with the pope go? How are the other cardinals?"

I should have Rochetaillée respond and then stop when Juan would naturally respond or when information requires Juan's input.\n\nRochetaillée's eyebrows rise at your laugh—not mockery, but genuine surprise at your candor.\n\n\"You admit to improvisation. To uncertainty. To not knowing if it would work.\" A strange expression crosses his face—something between respect and bewilderment. \"I have spent eight years in councils where men would rather die than admit they did not have a plan.\"\n\nHe resumes his slow pacing, but the rhythm has changed. Less performance, more genuine thought.\n\n\"Checks against corruption in high office.\" He strokes his chin. \"This is what Basel has debated endlessly. The problem is that any check requires someone to enforce it—and who checks the checker? Councils can check popes, but councils can be corrupted. Popes can check councils, but popes can be corrupted. Round and round.\"\n\nHe stops.\n\n\"But there are mechanisms. Regular audits by external authorities—metropolitans reviewing Camera accounts, not just Parentucelli's successors reviewing themselves. Term limits for key positions, preventing any man from building a personal fiefdom. Required consultation before major financial decisions—not a veto, but a record that someone asked questions.\" He shrugs. \"None of these are perfect. All can be circumvented by determined corruption. But they create friction. They make theft harder, slower, more visible.\"\n\nHe waves a hand. \"I will think on this more carefully and write my thoughts for His Holiness, if you believe he would welcome them.\"\n\nAt the clarification about amnesty, he nods slowly.\n\n\"Traditional conduct protected. Egregious offenses still subject to examination.\" He considers this. \"That is... wiser than I understood. The decree's language was perhaps deliberately vague?\"\n\nBut it is your offer about the knights that stops him mid-thought.\n\n\"You would leave your knights in Rome.\" He says it flatly, testing the words. \"You would sail to Constantinople—to face the Ottoman Sultan with diminished forces—so that the Pope retains his protection.\"\n\nHe stares at you.\n\n\"Do you understand what you are offering? The journey to Constantinople is already desperate. You lost seventy-five men to a storm. You have five hundred ninety-one remaining. If you leave a meaningful garrison here—one hundred, two hundred men—you arrive at the walls of Constantinople with a force that cannot hold a single gate against a serious assault.\"\n\nHis voice drops.\n\n\"You would risk your life—risk failure—for a church reform that may collapse anyway once you are gone.\"\n\nHe shakes his head slowly.\n\n\"Either you are mad, or you truly believe what you said about God's kingdom on earth.\"\n\nA moment passes. Then he seems to remember your question about the consistory.\n\n\"The meeting.\" His expression shifts—the political observer returning. \"I was not present, but I have... sources. Men who owe me reports.\"\n\nHe glances around, ensuring no one is close enough to overhear.\n\n\"His Holiness emerged with formal agreement. The cardinals will not obstruct. They signed what needed signing, nodded when nodding was required.\" He pauses. \"But there was no fire in that room, Your Majesty. No conviction. They accept because Colonna fled and resistance seems futile. They will not lift a finger to help Parentucelli. They will not spend political capital defending the reform. They will watch, and wait, and if it fails, they will say they always had concerns.\"\n\nHis lips thin.\n\n\"Cardinal Albergati spoke beautifully, I am told. He is genuine—but he is seventy years old and better suited to prayer than politics. Cardinal Capranica supported the proposals but committed to nothing specific. The others...\" He shrugs. \"Passive. Careful. Protecting themselves.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then adds:\n\n\"There is another matter. Cardinal Condulmer—the Pope's nephew. He demanded private audience with His Holiness. The conversation was... not quiet. Servants heard raised voices. Weeping. The word 'betrayal.'\" Rochetaillée's expression is carefully neutral. \"He has withdrawn from curial affairs. He attends nothing. Speaks to no one. But he is the Pope's blood, and he feels himself wronged.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"A wounded nephew is a small thing. Until it is not. Men who feel betrayed by family sometimes do foolish things. And men who wish the reform to fail now have a sympathetic figure—a cardinal wronged by his own uncle for the sake of Spanish influence.\"\n\nHe lets that sit for a moment.\n\n\"This is the ground on which your reform stands, Your Majesty. External support—myself, Orsini, even the Medici, I hear—but hollow within. The Pope has acquiescence, not allies. Parentucelli has authority, but the men who should support him offer only words.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"You asked how you can help. Perhaps the question is: how do we fill that hollow center before you sail east?\""

He's been given a glimpse of genuine faith and offered partnership. He should probably:\n\n1. Express something about this unexpected encounter\n2. Perhaps make a commitment or statement about his next steps\n3. Leave the door open for continued cooperation\n\nThen I need to move the narrative forward - what happens next? It's late afternoon/evening of March 23, 1434. Juan is with his knights. The consistory has concluded. Lucia is sailing to Naples. Parentucelli is in the Camera.\n\nPossible next beats:\n- News from Parentucelli about what he's finding\n- Word from the ships about Lucia\n- Evening approaching - what does Juan do?\n- Someone else seeking audience with Juan\n- Eugenius sending for Juan to discuss the consistory results and next steps (letters to Basel, etc.)\n\nLet me write Rochetaillée's closing response and then set up the next narrative beat.\n\nRochetaillée regards you for a long moment. The evening light catches the silver in his hair, the lines around his eyes that speak of years spent in airless chambers debating points of canon law while the world outside continued without him.\n\n\"Where there was one, now there are two,\" he repeats softly. \"You make it sound like the Gospel. The mustard seed.\"\n\nHe almost smiles.\n\n\"I came here to take your measure, Your Majesty. To determine whether you were a threat to be managed or an opportunity to be exploited.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"I find instead that I am... unsettled. You do not fit the categories I have spent a lifetime constructing.\"\n\nHe straightens, recovering formal dignity, though it sits lighter on him now.\n\n\"I will write to Cardinal d'Allemand tonight. I will recommend that Basel accept these reforms as vindication of conciliar principles. I will urge reconciliation rather than continued conflict.\" He pauses. \"I cannot promise he will listen. D'Allemand has his own ambitions, his own vision. But my voice carries weight, and I will use it.\"\n\nHe begins to turn, then stops.\n\n\"One more thing, Your Majesty. A word of counsel, if you will permit it.\"\n\nHe glances toward the Vatican.\n\n\"Cardinal Condulmer. The wounded nephew.\" His voice drops. \"Do not leave that wound to fester. His Holiness cannot heal it—he is the one who inflicted it. But you...\" He considers. \"You are outside the family. You owe Condulmer nothing, and he owes you nothing. Sometimes a word from an outsider reaches where family cannot.\"\n\nHe inclines his head.\n\n\"I do not presume to tell a king his business. But you asked what might fill the hollow center. Sometimes it begins with one man who feels seen rather than discarded.\"\n\nA formal bow—proper now, cardinal to sovereign.\n\n\"Your Majesty. I will not forget this conversation. Whatever comes, know that Jean de Rochetaillée heard you speak of God's kingdom and children's happiness, and believed you meant it.\"\n\nHe turns and walks back toward the Vatican, scarlet robes catching the fading light.\n\nThe courtyard settles into evening quiet. Your knights have found positions against walls and columns, some dicing, others praying, most simply waiting with the patience of men accustomed to long campaigns.\n\nMarco Tornesi appears at your elbow.\n\n\"Majestad. A messenger from the Camera. Parentucelli requests your presence when convenient. He says...\" Marco frowns, recalling the exact words. \"He says he has found something you should see.\"\n\nThe Vatican looms before you. Somewhere within, a pope manages cardinals who have granted him compliance without conviction. Somewhere within, a wounded nephew nurses grievance. Somewhere within, a scholar with ink-stained fingers sifts through decades of corruption.\n\nAnd in Ostia's harbor, your ships wait—pointing east toward Constantinople, where an empire dies by inches.\n\nWhat do you do?"

Fray Hernando offers a measured assessment of the day: acknowledging its extraordinary nature while warning against confusing dramatic moments with sustained holiness. He cautions that the golden light may have been coincidence and that cardinals who knelt in the heat of the moment may not sustain their commitment. Juan pushes back, noting he has never claimed divine confirmation for himself. Juan then asks Fray Hernando to consider staying in Rome for a year to help the Pope, recognizing the reform needs trustworthy men. Fray Hernando is shaken by the request, reflecting on their fourteen years together since Juan was sixteen. He acknowledges the practical wisdom but grieves the separation, especially before Juan's dangerous voyage to Constantinople. He asks for the night to pray on it and extracts a promise that Juan will find a new confessor who will speak hard truths without fear or flattery.",

As Juan's trusted confessor, Fray Hernando has been a constant companion throughout this critical voyage.\n\nA knight is dispatched into the Vatican, and some minutes later, Fray Hernando emerges from the basilica's shadow. He has been at prayer, you suspect—his knees are dusty, his expression carrying that particular stillness that comes from hours spent in conversation with God.\n\nHe approaches without hurry, brown Franciscan robes swaying, and inclines his head.\n\n\"Majestad.\"\n\nHis eyes take in the scene—the knights at rest, the fading light, your position in the courtyard where you have clearly been holding informal court.

The external support (Orsini cooperating, French faction converting, Medici helping)\n4. The internal weakness (passive cardinals, wounded Condulmer, doubting Pallavicini)\n5. Juan's conversation with Rochetaillée\n\nFray Hernando has been established as:\n- Willing to challenge Juan when necessary\n- Understanding and non-judgmental despite moral rigor\n- Careful in discernment - helps Juan distinguish divine guidance from personal desire\n- Warned Juan about pride after the Florence speech\n- Challenged Juan about the Isabel Ruiz meeting crisis\n- Concerned about Juan's tendency to transform spiritual breakthroughs into grand gestures\n\nHe would likely:\n- Acknowledge the extraordinary nature of what happened\n- Express genuine hope and gratitude\n- But also raise concerns about:\n  - Whether the golden light was a sign or coincidence (and whether that matters)\n  - The hollow internal support\n  - Juan's tendency to see divine confirmation in dramatic moments\n  - The danger of building on one man's faith\n  - What happens when Juan leaves\n\nHe should be honest, thoughtful, and somewhat cautionary without being negative. He's a spiritual advisor, not a politician.\n\nLet me write his response in character - measured, wise, honest, caring.\n\nFray Hernando does not answer immediately. He turns to look at St. Peter's, its dome now painted in shades of rose and gold by the setting sun. His weathered face is difficult to read—contemplation, perhaps, or the careful marshaling of thoughts he knows must be spoken with precision.\n\n\"An important day,\" he repeats slowly. \"Yes. Perhaps one of the most important I will witness in my lifetime.\"\n\nHe is quiet for another moment. When he speaks again, his voice is soft—meant for you alone.\n\n\"I watched a pope confess his failures before God and man. I watched cardinals kneel in what appeared to be genuine repentance. I watched you swear an oath that binds your kingdom to the defense of the Church, asking nothing in return.\" He pauses. \"And I watched light fall upon the papal throne as though heaven itself was watching.\"\n\nHis hands remain folded in his sleeves, but his fingers tighten slightly.\n\n\"I should feel triumph. Joy. Vindication. Everything we have worked toward since that chapel in Rome four years ago, when you stripped yourself before Pope Martin and offered everything to God.\" He turns to look at you, and his eyes are troubled. \"And I do feel those things. But I also feel...\"\n\nHe searches for the word.\n\n\"Unease.\"\n\nHe moves to stand beside you, both of you facing the Vatican now.\n\n\"Do you remember what I told you after Florence? After your speech moved the crowd to tears and men threw coins at your feet?\" He does not wait for your answer. \"I warned you about pride. About the danger of believing your own legend. About the ease with which a man can mistake the crowd's adulation for God's approval.\"\n\nHis voice gentles.\n\n\"Today was not Florence. Today was not performance. I watched you, Juan. I saw your face when you knelt. That was real. That was faith, not theatre.\" A pause. \"And yet.\"\n\nHe turns to face you fully.\n\n\"The light, mijo. The golden light that fell upon Eugenius as he spoke. Half of Rome will say it was a miracle. The hand of God, blessing this reform, confirming that we act in His name.\"\n\nHis expression is carefully neutral.\n\n\"Perhaps it was. I am a poor Franciscan friar. I do not presume to know when God chooses to make His presence manifest and when He does not.\" He holds your gaze. \"But I have also seen light fall through windows at opportune moments that signified nothing more than the movement of clouds. I have seen men take coincidence for confirmation and build entire theologies on accidents of weather.\"\n\nHe reaches out and places a hand on your arm—the touch of a father confessor, firm and grounding.\n\n\"If the light was Providence, then we proceed with gratitude and humility, knowing that God's favor must be earned again each day through righteous action. If the light was coincidence, then we proceed exactly the same way—because the reforms are just, the cause is holy, and we do not require miraculous signs to know we do God's work.\"\n\nHe releases your arm.\n\n\"What troubles me is not the light itself. What troubles me is what men will do with it. Cardinals who knelt because they were swept up in the moment, not because their hearts changed. A pope who may believe himself specially blessed rather than specially obligated. And you...\"\n\nHe hesitates, choosing his words with care.\n\n\"You have a tendency, my son, to see divine confirmation in dramatic moments. To believe that because something feels transcendent, it must be transcendent. To trust the fire in your heart more than the quiet voice that comes in stillness.\"\n\nHis eyes search your face.\n\n\"The Mass this morning was extraordinary. But extraordinary moments end. Tomorrow there will be no golden light. There will be ledgers and frightened clerks and passive cardinals and a wounded nephew who believes himself betrayed. There will be letters to write and allies to cultivate and a thousand small decisions that do not feel transcendent at all.\"\n\nHe folds his hands back into his sleeves.\n\n\"That is where holiness lives, Juan. Not in the blaze of noon, but in the long watches of the night. Not in the oath that moves men to tears, but in keeping that oath when no one is watching and the cost is higher than you expected.\"\n\nA ghost of a smile crosses his face.\n\n\"You asked what I think of what happened today. I think God was present in St. Peter's this morning—but not only in the light. He was present in your oath. In Eugenius's confession. In Parentucelli's courage. In the decision of men like Rochetaillée to set aside eight years of warfare and ask how they might help build rather than destroy.\"\n\nHe looks back at the Vatican.\n\n\"Those are the miracles that matter, mijo. Not light through windows. Changed hearts. And changed hearts require tending, day after day, or they harden again.\"\n\nHe turns back to you.\n\n\"So. An important day, yes. Perhaps a holy one. But the holiness will be proven not by what happened this morning, but by what we do tomorrow. And the day after. And every day until we stand before God and give account of whether we were worthy of the trust He placed in us.\"\n\nHe waits, watching you with the patient attention of a man who has heard your confessions for years and knows exactly which questions you need to sit with.\n\n\"Is that the answer you sought? Or did you hope I would simply say 'God has blessed us' and leave it there?\""

You know what it would cost me. So I must believe you ask it because you believe it necessary.\" He studies your face. \"Tell me why. Not the political reasons—I can see those well enough. Eugenius needs men of faith around him. The cardinals offer words without conviction. Parentucelli is brilliant but young and has never navigated Vatican politics.

I will have an answer for you by morning.\" His voice is rough. \"And if the answer is yes—if I stay—then you must promise me something.\"\n\nHe turns back to you, and his eyes are fierce.\n\n\"Promise me you will find another confessor. A good one. Someone who will not flatter you, who will not fear you, who will tell you when you are wrong. Promise me you will not sail to Constantinople believing yourself beyond the need for such a voice.\"\n\nHe waits."

The Medici records help but are incomplete for internal Camera arrangements. Parentucelli identifies the core challenge: not active opposition but the institutional weight of a system that has absorbed reforms for a thousand years. He observes that the clerks are betting they can outlast the reform through minimal compliance, as they have outlasted every previous reform effort.

The work does not wait for old friars to sort their hearts.\"\n\nTHE CAMERA BUILDING — Evening, March 23, 1434\n\nThe walk from the courtyard to the Camera takes only minutes, but the atmosphere shifts as you approach. Pallavicini's guards stand at the entrance—alert enough, but without the crisp energy of men who believe in their task. They straighten when they see you, fists to chests in salute.\n\nInside, the building smells of dust, ink, and old parchment. Candles have been lit against the failing light, casting long shadows across stone floors worn smooth by generations of clerks. The central records chamber is a hive of quiet activity—men bent over ledgers, the scratch of quills, the occasional murmured conversation.\n\nParentucelli is at the center of it all, standing at a large table covered in documents. His black robes are rumpled, his thin face drawn with exhaustion. He has not slept in two days, and it shows. But his eyes, when they find you, are sharp and alert.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He sets down the document he was examining. \"Thank you for coming.\"\n\nHe gestures for you to approach the table, away from the ears of the clerks working nearby.\n\nSITUATION ANALYSIS — Parentucelli's State\n\nWhat we know:\n\nHe's been working for hours since the seizure\n\nHe already found evidence of systematic theft this morning\n\nThe Medici are providing records (Roll: 74)\n\nOrsini is providing intelligence (Roll: 82)\n\nSome corrupt officials fled with documents (Roll: 10)\n\nThe remaining officials are more cooperative, but gaps exist\n\nPallavicini's guards are adequate but unenthusiastic (Roll: 9)\n\nWhat he might want to discuss:\n\nProgress report (routine)\n\nSpecific discovery in the records\n\nPractical problem needing decision\n\nPersonnel concerns\n\nSecurity issues\n\nSomething from Medici or Orsini intelligence\n\nNothing urgent—simply touching base with his protector\n\nD100 TABLE: What Does Parentucelli Want to Discuss?\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nSerious problem. Something has gone wrong. A security breach, a threat against Parentucelli personally, evidence of coordinated obstruction among remaining staff, or discovery that critical records were destroyed before the seizure. The reform faces an immediate challenge requiring decision.\n6-15\nTroubling discovery. The records reveal something worse than expected—not just skimming, but systematic theft on a scale that implicates more people than anticipated. Or evidence pointing toward a cardinal who knelt this morning. Or indication that the crusade treasury losses were deliberate sabotage, not mere corruption. Parentucelli needs guidance on how to proceed.\n16-25\nPractical obstacles. The work continues but faces friction. Remaining clerks are technically compliant but subtly obstructive. Pallavicini's guards are slow to respond to requests. The Medici records are useful but incomplete. Parentucelli is not alarmed, but wants Juan to know the reform is harder than this morning's enthusiasm suggested.\n26-40\nStatus report. Nothing dramatic. Parentucelli is methodically working through the records, building the case for specific reforms, identifying which officials can be trusted. Progress is steady. He called Juan because he believes his patron should be informed, and because he values counsel—not because there is crisis.\n41-55\nPersonnel question. Parentucelli has identified clerks who seem genuinely honest—men who kept their heads down during the corruption but never participated. He wants to promote them, build a trustworthy core staff. But he is uncertain of his authority and wants Juan's support before acting. A practical matter, not urgent.\n56-70\nUseful intelligence. The Medici records or Orsini's information has revealed something valuable—a pattern, a connection, a name. Not a crisis, but a thread worth pulling. Parentucelli wants to discuss whether and how to pursue it. The investigation is bearing fruit.\n71-80\nUnexpected cooperation. Someone has come forward voluntarily—a clerk with useful knowledge, a minor official with documents he preserved, perhaps even a cardinal's secretary with information about his master's arrangements. Parentucelli wants Juan to know the reform is finding allies in unexpected places.\n81-90\nSignificant discovery. The records reveal something important—evidence that could strengthen the reform considerably. Perhaps proof of which specific cardinals were most deeply involved. Perhaps documentation that the escaped officials can be tracked. Perhaps a financial irregularity that, once corrected, will recover substantial funds. Good news.\n91-95\nStrategic opportunity. Parentucelli has identified a way to accelerate the reform—a procedural shortcut, a key appointment, a document that legitimizes broader action. He is excited, energized despite his exhaustion. He wants Juan's blessing before proceeding. The work is going better than expected.\n96-100\nBreakthrough. Something extraordinary has emerged from the records. Evidence that fundamentally changes the reform's position—perhaps proof of crimes so serious that even passive cardinals must act, perhaps recovery of funds thought lost, perhaps documentation that makes the case for reform irrefutable. Parentucelli's hands are shaking as he shows you what he found.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

The Medici records are useful but incomplete. Parentucelli is not alarmed, but wants Juan to know the reform is harder than this morning's enthusiasm suggested.\"\n\nThis fits well with what we know:\n- Pallavicini rolled 9 (growing doubt, guards adequate but without energy)\n- Reform Cardinals rolled 9 (symbolic without substance)\n- Camera Officials rolled 10 (most guilty fled, rest more cooperative - but \"more cooperative\" doesn't mean enthusiastic)\n\nSo Parentucelli is experiencing the reality of the hollow internal support that the faction rolls revealed. He's not in crisis, but he's discovering that the golden moment of the Mass doesn't translate into practical cooperation.\n\nLet me write this scene showing Parentucelli sharing his observations about the friction he's encountering. He's exhausted, methodical, and wants Juan to understand the reality on the ground.\n\nPARENTUCELLI RESULT: 16 — Practical Obstacles\n\nParentucelli waits until you are close enough for quiet conversation, then speaks in a low voice. His Latin is precise, his tone measured—a scholar delivering an assessment, not a man in crisis.\n\n\"The work continues, Your Majesty. I want you to know that first. We are making progress. The Medici records are valuable—they confirm transactions the Camera ledgers obscured. Cardinal Orsini's intelligence has helped identify which clerks were most deeply involved.\" He pauses. \"But.\"\n\nHe gestures at the room around him—the bent heads, the scratching quills, the quiet industry.\n\n\"Do you see how they work? Diligent. Compliant. Every request answered, every document produced.\" His jaw tightens. \"And yet.\"\n\nHe picks up a ledger from the table.\n\n\"I asked for the servitia communia records from 1431. Three clerks searched for two hours. They found nothing. Apologized profusely. Suggested the records might have been misfiled years ago.\" He sets the ledger down. \"This morning, I found them myself. In exactly the location the index indicated. Exactly where any competent clerk would have looked first.\"\n\nHis eyes meet yours.\n\n\"They are not obstructing me openly. They would never dare—not with your knights outside and His Holiness's seal on my commission. But they are... slow. Forgetful. Regretful. Documents take hours to locate. Questions receive answers that are technically true but practically useless. Every task that should take minutes takes hours.\"\n\nHe moves to another stack of papers.\n\n\"The Medici records help, but they are incomplete. They document what the bank handled—transfers, loans, deposits. They do not document internal Camera arrangements that never touched banking channels. For those, I need the clerks. And the clerks...\"\n\nHe trails off, rubbing his eyes with ink-stained fingers.\n\n\"Captain Pallavicini's guards are similar. They follow orders. They secure the building. But when I ask for a clerk to be brought for questioning, it takes twenty minutes instead of five. When I request a guard at a particular door, he arrives—eventually. Nothing I can point to as defiance. Nothing that violates their instructions. Simply... friction.\"\n\nHe leans against the table, exhaustion evident in every line of his body.\n\n\"I am not alarmed, Your Majesty. This is not collapse. This is the ordinary resistance of an institution that does not wish to change. I expected it.\" A thin smile. \"I simply did not expect to feel it so soon. This morning there was golden light and cardinals weeping. This evening there are clerks who cannot find documents and guards who walk slowly.\"\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\"I will overcome it. I have twenty years of watching how this place works. I know where the records should be even when they tell me otherwise. I know which clerks are truly incompetent and which are performing incompetence. Given time, I will build a staff I can trust and remove those I cannot.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"But I wanted you to understand the reality, Your Majesty. The Mass this morning was a beginning, not an end. The men who knelt have returned to their chambers and begun calculating how to preserve what they can. The men who fled have taken evidence with them. The men who remain smile and comply and wait to see if this reform will last or if they can simply outlast it.\"\n\nHe gestures at the candles, the shadows, the quiet industry of men who serve without believing.\n\n\"This is what we are truly fighting. Not cardinals or factions or even corruption. We are fighting the weight of an institution that has survived for a thousand years by absorbing change rather than accepting it. They have seen reforms before. They have seen reformers before. They are betting that if they move slowly enough, comply minimally enough, this too shall pass.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"I do not intend to let it pass. But I wanted you to see it clearly. The golden light is gone. Now there is only the work.\"\n\nHe waits, watching you with eyes that are tired but unwavering.\n\n\"Is there counsel you would offer? Or shall I simply continue as I am, grinding through their resistance one misfiled document at a time?\""

The exhausted Pope reports the consistory yielded unanimous agreement with zero genuine commitment. Cardinals Capranica and Albergati spoke well but others were passive. Condulmer's confrontation weighs heavily on Eugenius, who grieves losing his nephew's love for the sake of reform. Juan proposes three strategic actions: send the reform decree to Basel requesting parallel legislation, write letters to all Christian monarchs asking support, and make new appointments rewarding reform supporters. They draft the letter to Basel together over an hour, carefully framing the Camera reform as complementary to conciliar work, inviting endorsement without demanding submission, and proposing Rochetaillee travel to Basel as papal messenger and bridge-builder. Juan then spends hours dictating letters to Emperor Sigismund, Kings of France, England, Poland-Hungary, Portugal, and Alfonso of Aragon, each carefully tailored. Roll 85 (Diplomatic Triumph): The letters catalyze a wave of European support. Sigismund declares the Como vision achieved and pressures Basel toward reconciliation. Multiple monarchs publicly praise Eugenius's courage. France, unwilling to stand alone, joins the chorus. The reform becomes a Christendom-wide movement. Juan visits his knights, reports all is well, and retires to empty chambers at the Palazzo di San Marco, praying Compline before falling asleep.",

          "text": "The Pope just finished a consistory that went poorly (Roll 35 - Passive Acceptance). He's probably exhausted and dealing with the aftermath of his confrontation with his nephew Condulmer.\n\nI should play this realistically - the Pope may or may not be available. Let me not roll for this since it's a simple question of availability. The Pope would likely want to speak with Juan given everything that's happened.\n\nThe Courtyard — Early Evening\n\nYou find your knights settling into the rhythms of an extended watch. Small fires have been lit in braziers—the Vatican servants providing them without being asked, a sign that someone has decided cooperation is wiser than obstruction. The smell of wood smoke mingles with the cooling Roman air.\n\nMarco Tornesi rises from a cluster of men dicing near the colonnade. His weathered face creases with attention as you approach.\n\n\"Majestad.\"\n\nYou brief him quietly—the reform proceeding, resistance passive rather than active, the need for continued vigilance without alarm. He listens without interruption, nodding at key points.\n\n\"The men are steady,\" he says when you finish. \"Fed, rested enough, ready if needed. Though some are asking how long we stay.\" He glances toward the Vatican buildings. \"Not complaint, Majestad. Just soldiers wanting to know the shape of things.\"\n\nYou tell him: for now, we provide security while the Church transitions. Days at least. Perhaps longer.\n\nHe accepts this with a grunt. \"I'll rotate watches. Keep the men sharp without wearing them down.\" A pause. \"The priests have been coming out to bless us. Three times now. The men don't mind it.\"\n\nHe returns to his duties, and you make your way into the Vatican.\n\nThe Papal Apartments — Evening\n\nThe corridors are quieter now. The frantic energy of the day has subsided into something more subdued—servants moving with purpose but without urgency, clergy walking in pairs and speaking in low voices. You pass cardinals' secretaries, minor officials, men whose faces you do not recognize but who recognize yours. They bow, step aside, watch you pass with expressions carefully neutral.\n\nAt the entrance to the papal apartments, a guard—one of Pallavicini's men—straightens at your approach.\n\n\"Your Majesty. His Holiness has asked that you be admitted whenever you arrive.\"\n\nThe man's tone is correct, his posture proper. But there is something mechanical about it—duty performed without investment. You remember Parentucelli's words: friction.\n\nYou are shown to an antechamber. A secretary disappears to announce you.\n\nMinutes pass.\n\nThen the door opens, and you are admitted to the Pope's private study.\n\nThe Pope's Study\n\nEugenius sits in a high-backed chair near the window, still wearing his white vestments though they are rumpled now, the crispness of the morning's ceremony long gone. A single candle burns on the desk beside him. The room smells of beeswax and old books.\n\nHe looks exhausted. More than exhausted—diminished. The man who spoke with such conviction in St. Peter's, who signed documents with steady hands while golden light poured down upon him, has retreated into something smaller and greyer.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He does not rise—a breach of protocol he would not have committed this morning. \"Forgive me. I find I have little ceremony left in me tonight.\"\n\nHe gestures to a chair across from him.\n\n\"Sit. Please.\"\n\nWhen you are seated, he is quiet for a moment, staring at the candle flame.\n\n\"The consistory,\" he says finally. \"You will want to know how it went.\"\n\nHe laughs—a short, bitter sound.\n\n\"They agreed. To everything. Every proposal, every appointment, every measure. Not a single cardinal voted against. Not a single objection raised.\" He looks at you. \"And not a single man in that room will lift a finger to help us succeed.\"\n\nHe rises, moving to the window. Rome spreads out below, torches and candles beginning to flicker in the darkness.\n\n\"Colonna has fled. Orsini cooperates—though I suspect his cooperation is purchased rather than given. Rochetaillée...\" He pauses. \"Rochetaillée spoke to me after the consistory. He was... different. He spoke of reconciliation with Basel. Of declaring victory and ending the constitutional conflict.\" A puzzled frown. \"I do not know what to make of him.\"\n\nHe turns back to you.\n\n\"And my nephew came to see me.\"\n\nThe words hang in the air. Eugenius's face is carefully controlled, but you can see the pain beneath the mask.\n\n\"Francesco believes I have betrayed him. Humiliated him before all of Rome. Made him a fool to elevate a commoner—Parentucelli—to authority over the office he nominally held.\" His voice is flat. \"He is not wrong. I did humiliate him. I did not warn him. I did not include him. I treated him as part of the problem rather than part of the family.\"\n\nHe returns to his chair, lowering himself slowly.\n\n\"He will not oppose us openly. He has too much pride for that—and too much fear of what it would cost him. But he has withdrawn. From me. From the reform. From everything.\" A long breath. \"I have purchased reform at the cost of my nephew's love. Perhaps that is an acceptable price. Tonight, it does not feel acceptable.\"\n\nHe looks at you—and for a moment, you see not a pope but a tired old man who has spent everything he had and is not certain it will be enough.\n\n\"You wished to plan next moves, Your Majesty. I am here. But I confess I do not know what moves remain. The documents are signed. The Camera is secured. The cardinals have agreed to everything and committed to nothing. What more can we do except wait and see if Parentucelli can build something lasting from the wreckage?\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"Tell me what you see.

Would promoting him help or would they need to find someone else? Eugenius might reflect on who could be promoted.\n\n4. Juan's overall assessment that things went well - Eugenius is exhausted and discouraged, but Juan is trying to provide perspective.\n\nLet me have Eugenius respond thoughtfully to each point. He's tired but should engage with the substance. He might:\n- Agree about Basel, but have thoughts about the framing\n- Appreciate the letters to monarchs idea\n- Reflect on appointments - who could be promoted? What about Pallavicini specifically?\n- Be somewhat lifted by Juan's positive framing, though still burdened\n\nI should also have Eugenius bring up Rochetaillée's surprising approach and what to make of it. And perhaps the question of Cardinal Condulmer - could something be done there?\n\nThe scene should end with them having a plan for the next day(s), setting up:\n- Letters to Basel\n- Letters to Christian monarchs\n- Appointments/promotions to consider\n- Perhaps addressing the Condulmer situation\n\nLet me write Eugenius's response in a way that feels authentic to his current emotional state but also shows him engaging with Juan's practical suggestions.\n\nEugenius listens, his exhaustion slowly giving way to something more attentive. You can see him gathering himself—the statesman emerging from beneath the tired old man.\n\n\"Parallel legislation,\" he repeats slowly. \"Yes. Basel signs what Rome has decreed, as Rome signed what Basel decreed. Neither submits to the other. Both authorities acting toward the same end.\"\n\nHe rises and moves to his desk, where parchment and ink wait. His movements are deliberate now, purposeful.\n\n\"The framing will matter. We do not demand Basel's compliance—we invite their participation. We present the Camera reform as complementary to their work on annates and benefices. The same spirit, the same goals, different spheres of application.\" He pauses, quill in hand. \"Rochetaillée spoke of reconciliation. If his conversion is genuine—and I confess I do not fully understand it—he may help prepare Basel to receive this well.\"\n\nHe sets the quill down without writing, turning back to you.\n\n\"The letters to Christian monarchs—yes. From both of us, I think. Your voice carries weight that mine does not. A pope asking for support is expected. A king who has just sworn to defend the Church without asking anything in return...\" A ghost of a smile. \"That is something new. Something they will not know how to categorize.\"\n\nAt the mention of appointments, Eugenius's expression grows more complex.\n\n\"New appointments. Rewards for those who believe.\" He moves back toward the window, thinking aloud. \"You mention Pallavicini. The captain has served competently, but...\"\n\nHe trails off, frowning.\n\n\"There is something in him that troubles me. He follows orders. He does his duty. But when I look in his eyes, I see a man calculating odds, not a man committed to a cause. Parentucelli tells me the guards are slow to respond. Not defiant—just... slow.\" He shakes his head. \"Promoting a man who does not believe may simply elevate doubt to a higher position.\"\n\nHe turns to face you.\n\n\"But you raise the true question: who does believe? Who has demonstrated commitment beyond words?\" He counts on his fingers. \"Parentucelli—but he is already elevated as high as I can raise him without making him a cardinal, and that requires time and process. Albergati believes, but he is seventy and better suited to prayer than administration. Rochetaillée—if genuine—but promoting a Frenchman who spent eight years fighting us would confuse everyone, including him.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"Cardinal Capranica has energy and capability, but I cannot read his heart. He applauded this morning. He supported proposals this afternoon. But he has never committed to anything before it was safe, and I do not know if today was conviction or calculation.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"There is Orsini. He has provided genuine assistance—intelligence about Camera corruption, information about which officials are compromised. But his cooperation is opportunism, not faith. With Colonna fled, he positions himself as the indispensable Roman aristocrat. Useful, but not trustworthy.\"\n\nHe returns to his chair, lowering himself with a heavy sigh.\n\n\"You are right that we must reward those who support us. I simply find myself uncertain who those people are. The Mass produced many converts. The afternoon revealed most of them to be... temporary.\"\n\nBut at your final words—everything went very well—Eugenius looks up with something like surprise.\n\n\"Well,\" he repeats. \"Yes. I suppose it did.\"\n\nHe is quiet for a moment, as if testing the idea.\n\n\"No blood. No schism. No cardinals declaring us illegitimate. Colonna fled rather than fought. The French faction speaks of reconciliation rather than war. The Medici provide records rather than obstruction.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"When I woke this morning, I thought there was a reasonable chance I would be dead by sunset. Or deposed. Or held hostage by my own College.\"\n\nA long breath.\n\n\"Instead, the documents are signed. The Camera is secured. The worst actors have fled or cooperate. And a king who owes me nothing sits in my study offering practical counsel about appointments and letters.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"You are right, Your Majesty. It could have gone much worse. I have spent so many years expecting catastrophe that I have forgotten how to recognize success.\" A pause. \"Thank you. For the reminder. And for... all of it.\"\n\nHe straightens in his chair, and something of the pope returns—the office reasserting itself over the man.\n\n\"Very well. Let us plan.\"\n\nHe reaches for parchment.\n\n\"First: the letter to Basel. I will draft it tonight—or begin it, at least. We present the Camera reform as extension of their work. We invite their endorsement. We propose...\"\n\nHe hesitates.\n\n\"What do we propose? Simple endorsement? Joint oversight? A delegation from Basel to observe implementation?\" He looks at you. \"Rochetaillée spoke of being a bridge. Perhaps we should use him. Send him to Basel as our voice, carrying the letter personally. It would demonstrate that former opponents have joined our cause.\"\n\nHe makes a note.\n\n\"Second: letters to the monarchs. Castile, Aragón, Portugal, France, the Empire, Naples. Each will require different framing. Your letter to your own kingdom. My letters to the others, with your signature alongside mine where appropriate.\" He pauses. \"The Emperor's response matters most. Sigismund has been neutral in the papal-conciliar conflict. If he endorses this approach, it strengthens everything.\"\n\nAnother note.\n\n\"Third: appointments. I will think carefully on who deserves elevation. Perhaps...\"\n\nHe stops, his quill hovering.\n\n\"There is something else. Something you said earlier, that I have been turning over in my mind.\"\n\nHe sets the quill down.\n\n\"My nephew. Francesco. Cardinal Rochetaillée said something similar when he spoke with me—that wounded men become dangerous, that grievances left to fester can poison everything.\" He looks at you. \"I cannot heal this wound myself. I am the one who inflicted it. But you...\"\n\nHe chooses his words carefully.\n\n\"You are outside our family. You owe Francesco nothing, and he owes you nothing. You have no history with him, no obligations, no debts. Sometimes a word from an outsider reaches where family cannot.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"Would you consider speaking with him? Not to apologize on my behalf—that is not your place. But simply to... see him. To let him know he is not forgotten in the rush of reform. To give him a chance to speak to someone who will listen without judgment.\"\n\nHe raises a hand.\n\n\"I do not ask this lightly. I know you have a thousand demands on your time. But I fear what Francesco may become if he is left alone with his grievance. And I fear what others may make of him if they see an opportunity.\""

          "text": "Juan wants to draft the letter to Basel together with the Pope. This is a significant moment - they need to craft a message that:\n\n1. Presents the Camera reform as complementary to Basel's work\n2. Invites Basel's endorsement without demanding submission\n3. Maintains the parallel legislation framework (neither authority submits to the other)\n4. Potentially proposes using Rochetaillée as a messenger/bridge\n\nI should play this out as a collaborative drafting session. The Pope and Juan working together on the content and framing. This is diplomatic work - careful word choices matter.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Basel has been in conflict with Rome over conciliar supremacy\n- The French faction at Basel (d'Allemand) is radical and wants Pope subordinate to Council\n- Rochetaillée (Roll 99) is recommending reconciliation - his letter is already traveling to Basel\n- The Castilian delegation (Fray Hernando was there, now Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena leads) has been building bridges\n- The parallel legislation model: Rome signs Basel's decrees, Basel signs Rome's decrees - neither submits\n\nWhat should the letter contain:\n1. Announcement of Rome's adoption of Basel's reform decrees (pluralism, concubinage, annates) - motu proprio but acknowledging Basel's work\n2. Presentation of the Camera reform as complementary - internal papal household matter but in the same spirit\n3. Invitation for Basel to endorse the Camera reform\n4. Proposal for ongoing cooperation - joint oversight? delegation?\n5. Framing that allows both sides to claim victory without either submitting\n\nI should have Eugenius and Juan discuss and debate the contents, perhaps with some back and forth about framing. Then produce a draft letter. This should feel collaborative and substantive.\n\nLet me write this as a scene of them working together on the letter.\n\nEugenius nods, a flicker of gratitude crossing his face at your willingness to approach Francesco. But he sets it aside—there is work to do first.\n\nHe moves to his desk properly now, arranging parchment, ink, and sand for blotting. A second chair is brought, and you sit beside him, the candle casting warm light across the blank page.\n\n\"The framing,\" Eugenius says, quill poised. \"This is everything. We must acknowledge Basel's work without submitting to their authority. We must invite their participation without demanding their approval. We must present the Camera reform as extension of their principles without admitting they have jurisdiction over papal household matters.\"\n\nHe dips the quill.\n\n\"Let us begin with what we agree upon, and find the difficult language as we go.\"\n\nThe Drafting Process\n\nThe work takes over an hour. Eugenius writes in elegant Latin, pausing frequently to read phrases aloud, to ask your opinion, to scratch out words and try again. The floor around the desk slowly accumulates crumpled parchment—failed attempts, abandoned phrasings, ideas that sounded better in the mind than on the page.\n\nOn acknowledging Basel's reforms:\n\n\"We have already signed their decrees on pluralism, concubinage, and annates,\" Eugenius says. \"Motu proprio—on our own authority. But we should acknowledge that their work inspired ours. Not that they commanded us, but that the Holy Spirit moved both authorities toward the same ends.\"\n\nHe writes, reads it back: \"The reforms which the Sacred Council, moved by the same Spirit that guides the Apostolic See, has wisely advanced...\"\n\nHe looks at you. \"Too much? Too little?\"\n\nOn presenting the Camera reform:\n\n\"This is the delicate part,\" Eugenius murmurs. \"The Camera is papal household. Basel has no jurisdiction over how we organize our own administration. But if we say that too bluntly, we invite conflict.\"\n\nSeveral attempts are made and rejected.\n\nFinally: \"In the same spirit of renewal that has guided the Council's deliberations, we have undertaken reform of the Apostolic Camera, that the administration of the Church's temporal affairs might better serve her spiritual mission...\"\n\nOn inviting Basel's endorsement:\n\n\"We cannot demand they sign our decree,\" Eugenius says. \"But we can invite them to add their voice to ours. To declare that the principles underlying our reform are consistent with the principles they themselves have championed.\"\n\nHe tries: \"We invite the fathers assembled at Basel to receive this decree in the spirit in which it is offered—as evidence that Rome and Council labor toward the same holy ends, though by different paths...\"\n\nHe frowns. \"Is that too weak? Should we be more direct?\"\n\nOn proposing cooperation:\n\n\"Rochetaillée spoke of being a bridge,\" Eugenius recalls. \"If we propose sending him to Basel as our messenger, carrying this letter personally, it demonstrates that former opponents have joined our cause.\"\n\nHe adds a passage proposing that Cardinal Rochetaillée travel to Basel \"to bear witness to what he has seen in Rome, and to discuss how the Apostolic See and the Sacred Council might coordinate their efforts for the reform and renewal of Holy Mother Church.\"\n\nOn the constitutional question:\n\n\"This is what we must not say,\" Eugenius says firmly. \"Nothing about supremacy. Nothing about whether councils can command popes or popes can dissolve councils. We speak only of cooperation, shared purpose, parallel efforts. Let the constitutional question remain unresolved—if both authorities are reforming the Church together, perhaps the question becomes academic.\"\n\nThe Draft\n\nAfter much revision, a working draft emerges. Eugenius reads it aloud, his voice steady now, the exhaustion temporarily forgotten in the satisfaction of craftsmanship:\n\nEUGENIUS, BISHOP, SERVANT OF THE SERVANTS OF GOD\n\nTo Our Venerable Brothers, the Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops, and other Fathers assembled in Sacred Council at Basel, greeting and apostolic benediction.\n\nThe renewal of Holy Mother Church, for which all faithful Christians pray, advances by many paths. The Sacred Council, moved by the same Spirit that guides the Apostolic See, has wisely addressed the disorders of pluralism, concubinage, and excessive taxation that have long troubled the Body of Christ. These reforms, which we have received and promulgated by our own apostolic authority, demonstrate that Council and Pope, when animated by shared devotion to Christ's Church, labor toward the same holy ends.\n\nIn this same spirit of renewal, we have undertaken reform of the Apostolic Camera, that the administration of the Church's temporal affairs might better serve her spiritual mission. We have appointed our beloved son Tommaso Parentucelli as Extraordinary Commissioner, with authority to examine all arrangements, audit all accounts, and restructure all procedures according to principles of transparency, accountability, and honest stewardship. The enclosed decree sets forth these reforms in detail.\n\nWe invite the fathers assembled at Basel to receive this decree in the spirit in which it is offered—not as assertion of authority over Council, nor as submission of papal household to conciliar jurisdiction, but as evidence that Rome and Basel labor toward the same sacred purpose. As we have added our apostolic voice to the Council's reforms, so we invite the Council to add its voice to ours, that all Christendom might see the Church united in renewal.\n\nTo this end, we propose to send Our Venerable Brother Jean, Cardinal Priest of San Sisto, to Basel as our messenger and voice. Cardinal Rochetaillée has witnessed the events in Rome and can bear testimony to what he has seen. We commend him to you as one who has journeyed from opposition to cooperation, and whose counsel may assist in discerning how Council and Apostolic See might best coordinate their efforts.\n\nWe beseech the fathers at Basel to receive our messenger with charity, to consider our proposals with wisdom, and to join with us in prayer for the unity and renewal of Christ's Church.\n\nGiven at Rome, at Saint Peter's, on the [date] day of March, in the year of Our Lord 1434, in the fourth year of our pontificate.\n\nEugenius sets down the quill and looks at you.\n\n\"What say you, Your Majesty? Does this strike the right tone? Is there anything you would add, remove, or change?\""

          "text": "1. **King Charles VII of France** - French interests are aligned with the French faction at Basel. The Rochetaillée faction served French policy. However, Rochetaillée just converted (Roll 99). France might be suspicious of Spanish-papal alliance. Juan has not met Charles VII.\n\n2. **King Henry VI of England** - Young king (about 12 years old in 1434), actually ruled by regents. England is embroiled in the Hundred Years' War with France. England has its own church politics. Juan has not met him.\n\n3. **King Władysław III of Poland** (or possibly Władysław II Jagiełło who died in 1434) - Actually, in 1434, Władysław II Jagiełło was still king but died in May/June 1434. So in March 1434, he's still alive. Poland has interests in Eastern Europe, concerned about Ottoman expansion and Teutonic Knights. Juan has not met him.\n\n4. **King Sigismund of Hungary** - Wait, Sigismund is the Holy Roman Emperor, not just King of Hungary. He's also King of Bohemia. Juan MET Sigismund at Como - they formed an alliance. This is a key relationship.\n\n5. **King João I of Portugal** - Juan's father-in-law (through his first wife who died). Important relationship. Aging but shrewd.\n\n6. **Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund** - Juan met him at Como. They have an alliance. Sigismund's support is crucial.\n\n7. **King Alfonso V of Aragon** - Juan's brother-in-law. Currently dependent on Juan's support for Naples claim. The Pope already endorsed Alfonso's claim to Naples in a previous decree.\n \nI'll strategically categorize the monarchs based on their potential receptiveness. France remains potentially hostile, with the recent Rochetaillée conversion adding complexity. England appears neutral, preoccupied with internal conflicts. Poland might be intrigued by potential crusade discussions. Portugal offers a friendly connection through familial ties. Sigismund, both as Hungarian king and Holy Roman Emperor, represents a critical ally from Como. Alfonso V's dependency creates a unique diplomatic leverage point.\n\nI'm developing a nuanced diplomatic reception mechanism that captures the subtle political dynamics across European courts. The approach will balance Juan's reputation from Granada, the Como Declaration's precedent, and the genuine reform content against potential suspicions of Spanish papal influence. The diplomatic outreach requires a comprehensive assessment that reflects the intricate political landscape, accounting for existing tensions like the Hundred Years' War and varying court perceptions.\n\nYou work through the evening and into the night. The scribe—a young Castilian clerk who traveled with your household—struggles to keep pace as you dictate, revise, and dictate again. Each letter requires different framing, different emphasis, different tone.\n\nThe Letters:\n\nTo Emperor Sigismund — The warmest letter, building on your alliance forged at Como. You remind him of your shared vision, the parallel legislation framework you proposed together, and inform him that it has now been achieved. You ask for his public endorsement, which would carry enormous weight with Basel and all German-speaking lands.\n\nTo King João I of Portugal — To your father-in-law, you write with familial respect. You inform him of events in Rome, emphasize the reform's religious rather than political character, and express hope that Portugal will add its voice to Christendom's renewal.\n\nTo King Alfonso V of Aragón — To your brother-in-law, whose claim to Naples the Pope has already endorsed, you write of mutual interest. A reformed papacy allied with both Iberian crowns strengthens all three. You remind him gently that papal support for his Neapolitan ambitions flows more reliably from a pope who is not beholden to corrupt cardinals or French factions.\n\nTo King Charles VII of France — The most delicate letter. You write with formal courtesy, making no assumptions about his position. You emphasize that the reform threatens no French interests—indeed, Cardinal Rochetaillée himself now supports reconciliation. You invite France to participate in the Church's renewal rather than oppose it.\n\nTo King Henry VI of England — A formal letter to a young king ruled by regents, emphasizing shared Christian duty and inviting England's support for Church reform during this troubled time.\n\nTo King Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland — You write of the Ottoman threat that concerns both your kingdoms, framing Church reform as strengthening Christendom's ability to defend itself. A united, reformed Church can mount the crusade that a corrupt, divided Church cannot.\n\nTo the other Christian princes — Shorter letters of similar character, informing them of events and inviting their support.\n\nSITUATION ANALYSIS: Reception of Juan's Letters\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nJuan's reputation from Granada conquest precedes him\n\nThe Como Declaration already established framework with Sigismund\n\nThe reforms are genuine and widely desired—hard to oppose publicly\n\nJuan asks for nothing material—no benefices, no territories, no gold\n\nRochetaillée's conversion undermines French opposition narrative\n\nNo monarch wants to be seen opposing Church reform\n\nJuan has family ties to Portugal (father-in-law) and Aragón (brother-in-law)\n\nComplication Factors:\n\nSuspicion of Spanish influence over the papacy\n\nFrance may see this as anti-French alignment regardless of assurances\n\nEngland is distracted by Hundred Years' War and internal regency politics\n\nSome courts will wait to see if reform actually succeeds before committing\n\nDistance means news travels slowly—weeks or months for responses\n\nEach court has its own Church politics and interests\n\nSome monarchs may resent being asked to support something they weren't consulted on\n\nThe Key Variable:\nThese letters arrive at courts across Europe over the coming weeks. Each monarch will respond based on their own interests, their assessment of whether this reform will last, and their calculation of what supporting or opposing it costs them.\n\nD100 TABLE: Reception of Juan's Letters Across European Courts\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nHostile coordination. The letters arrive at an unfortunate moment. France, already suspicious, interprets Juan's outreach as confirmation of Spanish-papal conspiracy. Charles VII coordinates with sympathetic parties at Basel to denounce the \"Spanish captivity of the Church.\" England, seeking French peace, follows France's lead. The Emperor wavers, unwilling to alienate France. Only Portugal and Aragón respond positively. Juan's diplomatic initiative backfires, hardening opposition rather than building support.\n6-15\nFrench rejection poisons the well. King Charles VII responds coldly, if at all. French diplomats at other courts whisper about Spanish overreach. The Emperor's response is delayed as Sigismund weighs French concerns. Portugal and Aragón support Juan quietly but not publicly. England ignores the letter entirely, consumed by internal matters. The reform has Iberian backing but fails to gain broader European endorsement.\n16-25\nPolite non-commitment. Most courts respond with formal courtesy that commits to nothing. The Emperor praises Juan's devotion but offers no specific endorsement. France acknowledges receipt without comment. Portugal and Aragón are warmer but cautious. The letters have informed Europe of events without generating active support or opposition. Monarchs are waiting to see what happens before committing.\n26-40\nMixed reception. Responses vary significantly by court. The Emperor responds positively, honoring the Como alliance. Portugal and Aragón offer genuine support. France is cool but not hostile—Charles VII is calculating, not committed to opposition. England sends a vague blessing. Poland expresses interest in the crusade implications. The reform has some international backing, but no unified European response. Adequate, not transformative.\n41-55\nCautious approval. Most courts respond with measured support. The Emperor endorses the parallel legislation framework publicly. Portugal and Aragón praise Juan's devotion to Church renewal. France is notably silent—neither supporting nor opposing—but French neutrality is better than French opposition. Poland and Hungary express interest in how reform might strengthen crusading efforts. The letters achieve their minimum goal: establishing that this is not merely a Spanish project.\n56-70\nSolid endorsement. The Emperor's response is strong—Sigismund publicly praises the Como framework's success and calls on Basel to cooperate with Rome. Portugal and Aragón offer full support. France, perhaps influenced by Rochetaillée's conversion, sends a cautiously positive response. England offers blessing. Poland proposes further discussion of crusade coordination. The reform gains meaningful international legitimacy.\n71-80\nEnthusiastic reception. Europe responds better than expected. Sigismund's endorsement is emphatic—he writes to Basel personally urging acceptance of parallel legislation. Alfonso of Aragón sees opportunity and offers active support. João of Portugal praises his son-in-law publicly. Even France, calculating that opposition isolates them, sends measured approval. The reform becomes a European cause, not merely a Roman event.\n81-90\nDiplomatic triumph. The letters catalyze a wave of support. Sigismund declares the Como vision achieved and pressures Basel toward reconciliation. Multiple monarchs send letters to Rome praising Eugenius's courage. France, unwilling to stand alone against European consensus, joins the chorus of approval. Juan's correspondence has transformed a Roman reform into a Christendom-wide movement. Basel will find it difficult to resist such unified pressure.\n91-95\nHistoric consensus. Something unprecedented: Christian monarchs united in support of Church reform. Sigismund proposes a congress of princes to coordinate support for the renewed Church. France, facing isolation, pivots to active cooperation. The letters have created a coalition that transcends the usual rivalries. The reform gains not just legitimacy but powerful protectors across Europe. When Juan sails for Constantinople, he leaves behind a continental alliance committed to the reform's success.\n96-100\nTransformation of Christendom. Juan's letters arrive at a moment of unexpected ripeness. Monarchs who have privately despaired of Church corruption seize this opportunity to declare themselves. The Emperor convenes a gathering of Christian princes to publicly endorse the reform. France, seeing the tide, joins enthusiastically—Charles VII will not be left behind as Christendom unites. The response exceeds anything Juan imagined. For one shining moment, Christian Europe speaks with one voice. The reform becomes not Juan's achievement or Eugenius's achievement, but Christendom's collective renewal. This is the foundation for something that might actually last.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

Keep it relatively short since the player is clearly indicating they want to move forward\n\nI should NOT:\n- Generate extensive new plot developments\n- Have NPCs approach Juan with new demands\n- Create artificial drama\n\nLet me write a good narrative conclusion to this eventful day.\n\nThe Courtyard — Late Night, March 23, 1434\n\nThe fires have burned low in the braziers. Your knights have arranged themselves in the patterns of men accustomed to sleeping in uncertain places—backs to walls, weapons within reach, small groups positioned to watch approaches. The Vatican looms above them, its windows dark except for scattered candles where clerks or cardinals work through the night.\n\nMarco Tornesi meets you as you cross the courtyard.\n\n\"Majestad.\" His voice is quiet, pitched not to wake the sleeping men. \"All quiet. A few servants coming and going. One cardinal's secretary hurried past an hour ago—looked frightened, but that seems to be the normal state of things here.\"\n\nYou tell him what you've told him before: no indications of challenge, but watchfulness regardless. He nods, unsurprised. This is the soldier's lot—long hours of nothing punctuated by moments of everything.\n\n\"The men will hold, Majestad. They've slept in worse places than Roman marble.\" A ghost of a smile. \"Some of them are saying this is the best-fed watch they've ever stood.\"\n\nYou clasp his shoulder briefly, then make your way to your quarters.\n\nYour Chambers — Palazzo di San Marco\n\nThe rooms feel empty without Lucia. Her things have been packed and taken to the ships—the small personal items, the letters she was writing, the embroidery she never finished. Catalina's wooden toys are gone from the corner where they were scattered this morning.\n\nA servant has left wine and bread, untouched. A candle burns on the desk where correspondence awaits—letters you will not answer tonight.\n\nYou undress without assistance, hanging your sword where you can reach it from the bed. Old habit. The mattress is soft—Roman luxury after weeks of shipboard hammocks—but sleep does not come immediately.\n\nThe day replays behind your closed eyes. Golden light falling through high windows. Cardinals kneeling on cold stone. Eugenius's voice breaking as he confessed his failures. Parentucelli's ink-stained fingers trembling as he held the documents. Rochetaillée's sharp eyes softening as the walls cracked.\n\nWhere there was one, now there are two.\n\nAnd Lucia, standing in this room before dawn, her hand on her belly where your child grows. Promise me you will come back.\n\nYou pray—the familiar words of Compline, the day's final office. Te lucis ante terminum, rerum Creator, poscimus... Before the ending of the day, Creator of the world, we pray...\n\nSleep takes you somewhere in the middle of the Nunc dimittis.\n\nDawn — March 24, 1434\n\nYou wake to Roman bells calling the faithful to morning Mass. Gray light filters through shutters. For a moment, disorientation—where is Lucia? Where is the rocking of the ship?\n\nThen memory returns. Rome. The reform. The work that continues.\n\nA servant knocks softly, announces that water has been heated for washing, that breakfast awaits, that several persons have requested audiences when Your Majesty is available.\n\nThe day begins.\n\nAWAITING AUDIENCES:\n\nPope Eugenius IV — The letter to Basel is complete; he wishes to finalize it and discuss next steps\n\nCardinal Francesco Condulmer — You agreed to speak with the Pope's wounded nephew\n\nTommaso Parentucelli — Continuing his work in the Camera; may have updates\n\nCardinal Rochetaillée — If he is to travel to Basel as proposed, arrangements must be made\n\nThe morning stretches before you.\n\nWhat do you do?"

          "text": "Actually, Rochetaillée rolled 99 and then 43 in conversation with Juan - \"the walls crack.\" He's already moving toward cooperation. Asking him to go to Basel is probably not a contested roll - he's likely to accept as part of his bridge-building role. I can narrate this positively.\n\nCondulmer is the uncertain one. He rolled 7 - bitter private confrontation with his uncle, withdrawn from curial affairs, nursing grievance. Juan is an outsider who might be able to reach him. This deserves a d100 table.\n\nThe Orsini rolled 82 - valuable cooperation, providing intelligence. They're already cooperating. But Juan speaking with them directly might deepen that relationship or reveal new information. This could be a roll for what comes of the conversation - what they reveal, what they want, how the relationship develops.\n\nLet me structure this:\n1. Morning - send letters, speak with Rochetaillée about Basel mission (narrative, likely positive)\n2. Speak with Condulmer (d100 table - this is the uncertain interaction)\n3. Speak with Orsini (d100 table for what develops from this conversation)\n\nLet me start with the Rochetaillée conversation and the letters being sent, then move to Condulmer.\n\nMorning — March 24, 1434\n\nYou break your fast quickly—bread, cheese, and watered wine—while a secretary organizes the letters drafted through the night. Each is sealed with your personal seal, the arms of Castile pressed into red wax. Couriers are summoned: reliable men from your household guard who have carried sensitive correspondence before.\n\n\"The letter to the Emperor travels fastest,\" you instruct. \"Sigismund's endorsement matters most. Portugal and Aragón next—family ties should yield quick responses. The others as roads allow.\"\n\nThe couriers depart within the hour, riding out through Rome's gates toward the roads that web across Europe. Weeks will pass before responses return. But the seeds are planted.\n\nCardinal Rochetaillée — Mid-Morning\n\nYou find the French cardinal in a small chapel adjacent to the Vatican, kneeling in prayer. He rises when he hears your footsteps, crossing himself before turning.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His expression is composed, but there is something different in his bearing today—less guarded, more settled. A man who has made a decision and is at peace with it.\n\n\"I have spent the night in prayer,\" he says simply. \"And in writing. A letter to Cardinal d'Allemand, as I promised. Recommending reconciliation. Explaining what I witnessed yesterday.\" A pause. \"It is... not an easy letter. I am telling a man I have worked beside for eight years that the cause we fought for has been achieved by the very authority we fought against.\"\n\nHe almost smiles.\n\n\"D'Allemand will not be pleased. But I believe he will listen. He is ambitious, but he is not a fool. If Rome and the princes of Europe unite behind this reform, continued opposition serves no one.\"\n\nWhen you raise the possibility of him traveling to Basel personally, carrying the papal letter alongside his own, Rochetaillée's eyebrows rise.\n\n\"You would send me as the Pope's messenger.\" He considers this. \"The man who spent eight years fighting papal authority, now carrying papal correspondence to the Council that was meant to humble Rome.\"\n\nA long pause.\n\n\"It is... audacious. And perhaps effective precisely because it is audacious.\" He strokes his chin. \"D'Allemand knows me. He trusts my judgment, even when he disagrees with it. If I stand before the Council and say 'I have seen what Rome has done, and it is genuine reform'—that carries weight that no letter can match.\"\n\nHe nods slowly.\n\n\"Yes. I will go. But I will need a few days to prepare. Letters of credential from His Holiness. Safe-conduct documents. And...\" He hesitates. \"I would ask that one or two of your Castilian delegation at Basel—Fray Hernando's people—be informed of my coming. If they can prepare ground before I arrive, speak with moderates, lay the foundation for reception...\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"This will not be easy, Your Majesty. D'Allemand has invested too much to simply accept defeat. But if we present this not as defeat but as victory—the Council's reforms achieved, the constitutional question set aside rather than resolved—he may find a path to acceptance.\"\n\nHe extends his hand.\n\n\"I will be your bridge. God grant I do not collapse under the weight.\"\n\nCardinal Francesco Condulmer — Late Morning\n\nThe Pope's nephew has taken chambers in a remote corner of the Vatican, far from the bustle of the papal apartments. When you request an audience, his secretary—a nervous young priest—hesitates visibly.\n\n\"His Eminence is... indisposed, Your Majesty. He is seeing no one.\"\n\nYou wait.\n\nThe secretary disappears. Minutes pass. Then the door opens, and you are admitted.\n\nThe room is dim, shutters drawn against the Roman sun. Condulmer sits in a chair by the cold fireplace, still wearing his cardinal's robes but with the rumpled look of a man who has not changed since yesterday. He does not rise when you enter.\n\n\"The King of Castile.\" His voice is flat, without inflection. \"Come to see the humiliated nephew. To offer comfort, perhaps. Or counsel.

The real one.\"\n\nNPC ANALYSIS — Cardinal Condulmer\n\nHis state:\n\nDeeply wounded by exclusion from the reform planning\n\nFeels humiliated before all Rome\n\nBelieves his uncle betrayed family loyalty for political expedience\n\nHas withdrawn from all curial activities\n\nNot yet committed to opposition, but nursing grievance that could turn dangerous\n\nWhat he fears:\n\nThat he is seen as either corrupt (complicit in Camera abuses) or incompetent (failed to notice them)\n\nThat his career is over, his reputation destroyed\n\nThat his uncle chose a stranger (Parentucelli) over blood\n\nThat no one in Rome sees him as anything other than an obstacle or embarrassment\n\nWhat he needs:\n\nTo be seen as a person, not a problem\n\nAcknowledgment that his treatment was painful, even if necessary\n\nSome sense of purpose or value going forward\n\nAssurance that he is not simply being discarded\n\nWhat Juan can offer:\n\nOutsider perspective, free from family entanglement\n\nHonesty without obligation\n\nPossibly a role or purpose that restores dignity\n\nThe simple gift of listening\n\nD100 TABLE: Conversation with Cardinal Condulmer\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nWalls harden. Condulmer interprets Juan's visit as political management—the Spanish king ensuring the wounded nephew won't cause trouble. Nothing Juan says penetrates. The conversation ends coldly, with Condulmer more convinced than ever that he is seen as a problem to be managed rather than a person to be valued. The grievance deepens. He becomes more dangerous, not less.\n6-15\nBitter venting. Condulmer pours out his grievance—the humiliation, the betrayal, the years of faithful service dismissed in a single night. Juan listens, but Condulmer is not ready to hear anything in return. The conversation exhausts both men without resolution. Condulmer is perhaps slightly relieved to have spoken, but fundamentally unchanged. The wound remains open.\n16-25\nGrudging acknowledgment. Condulmer hears Juan's words but cannot fully accept them. He acknowledges that the reform may be necessary, that the corruption was real. But he cannot forgive the method—the exclusion, the surprise, the public humiliation. The conversation ends with mutual respect but no reconciliation. Condulmer remains withdrawn, though perhaps slightly less hostile.\n26-40\nPainful honesty. Juan speaks truthfully about what happened and why. Condulmer listens—not happily, but genuinely. He cannot accept everything Juan says, but he recognizes honesty when he hears it. The conversation plants seeds that may grow over time. Condulmer remains wounded, but the possibility of healing opens.\n41-55\nGenuine connection. Something in Juan's approach—perhaps the directness, perhaps the lack of agenda—reaches Condulmer. He speaks more openly than he intended, revealing fears beneath the anger. Juan listens without judgment. By the end, Condulmer has not forgiven his uncle, but he no longer sees Juan as an enemy. A fragile connection forms.\n56-70\nThe wound examined. Juan helps Condulmer see his situation more clearly—not just the injury, but what lies beneath it. Was he truly happy as Camerlengo? Did he know, on some level, that something was wrong? Condulmer resists these questions, then slowly engages with them. The conversation does not heal, but it begins the process of honest self-examination.\n71-80\nPath forward glimpsed. Juan offers something beyond sympathy: the suggestion that Condulmer's story is not over. The Camerlengo position was a trap—a figurehead role that would have ended in scandal whenever the corruption was exposed. Perhaps there is dignity in being freed from it. Condulmer is not convinced, but he is thinking. The possibility of purpose beyond grievance opens.\n81-90\nUnexpected understanding. Condulmer finds himself telling Juan things he has told no one—his doubts about his own role, his suspicion that he was placed in the Camera precisely because he would not ask questions, his fear that his entire career has been a comfortable lie. Juan's witness transforms confession into catharsis. Condulmer emerges shaken but lighter.\n91-95\nReconciliation begins. Juan's presence, his honesty, his willingness to see Condulmer as a man rather than a problem—these gifts unlock something. Condulmer weeps. He speaks of his uncle not with anger but with grief. He asks Juan what he should do. The wound remains, but it has been cleaned. Healing becomes possible. He agrees to speak with Eugenius again, with Juan as intermediary if needed.\n96-100\nTransformation through witness. The impossible: in a single conversation, Juan reaches the core of Condulmer's pain and helps him see it clearly. The humiliation was real, but so was the corruption he failed to see. The exclusion was painful, but so was the complicity of his ignorance. Condulmer does not merely forgive—he understands. He asks how he might serve the reform he resented. A potential enemy becomes a genuine ally.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

He cannot accept everything Juan says, but he recognizes honesty when he hears it. The conversation plants seeds that may grow over time. Condulmer remains wounded, but the possibility of healing opens.\n\nThen I need to set up the meeting with Cardinal Orsini and potentially draft a d100 table for that interaction.\n\nCONDULMER RESULT: 26 — Painful Honesty\n\nYou meet Condulmer's bitter gaze without flinching.\n\n\"The real reason,\" you say. \"Very well.\"\n\nYou remain standing—not to dominate, but because sitting feels like settling in for political negotiation, and that is not why you came.\n\n\"I am here because your uncle asked me to come. But he did not send me with instructions or arguments or offers. He asked because he cannot reach you himself—he is the one who wounded you, and wounds do not hear clearly from the hands that made them.\"\n\nCondulmer's expression does not change, but something flickers in his eyes.\n\n\"I was not in the room when the decision was made to exclude you,\" you continue. \"I do not know why your uncle chose as he did. Perhaps he feared you would warn others. Perhaps he thought to protect you from association with what was coming. Perhaps he simply did not think of you at all, consumed by the weight of what he was about to do.\"\n\nYou pause.\n\n\"Any of those reasons would wound. I cannot tell you which is true. Only your uncle can, and perhaps he does not fully know himself.\"\n\nCondulmer's jaw tightens. \"He chose a commoner over his own blood. A secretary. A man with no family, no name, no—\"\n\n\"A man with no complicity,\" you say quietly. \"Parentucelli has been watching the Camera for twenty years, burning with fury at what he saw, powerless to act. He is not your replacement, Your Eminence. He is a surgeon called to cut out a cancer. You were never the cancer—but you were standing in the operating theater.\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"That does not make it hurt less,\" Condulmer says finally. \"Being told I was not the disease, merely... irrelevant.\"\n\n\"No. It does not.\"\n\nYou let the silence hold for a moment.\n\n\"The reform is real,\" you say. \"The corruption was real. Seventy thousand florins meant for crusade—for the defense of Constantinople against the Turk—vanished into 'administrative expenses' in ten months. Men skimmed and stole and called it tradition. Your uncle knew something was wrong but feared to look. When he finally looked, he found rot so deep that only fire could cleanse it.\"\n\nCondulmer's hands grip the arms of his chair.\n\n\"And I was part of the rot.\"\n\n\"You were part of the system. Whether you were part of the rot—\" You shake your head. \"I do not know. I do not think your uncle believes so, or he would not grieve as he does. But that question is between you and God, not you and me.\"\n\nThe cardinal is quiet for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice is smaller.\n\n\"I did not know. I should have known—I held the office, I signed the documents—but I did not know. They showed me what they wanted me to see. I asked the questions they expected me to ask. And I told myself that this was how things worked, that my inexperience simply needed time to understand the complexities.\"\n\nHe looks up at you.\n\n\"Is that corruption? Or merely cowardice?\"\n\n\"That,\" you say gently, \"is a question for confession. Not for a foreign king standing in your chamber.\"\n\nSomething shifts in Condulmer's face—not forgiveness, not acceptance, but perhaps the first crack in the wall of pure grievance.\n\n\"You speak honestly,\" he says. \"I did not expect that.\"\n\n\"I have no reason to lie to you, Your Eminence. I have no history with you, no obligations, no debts. I am simply a man who believes the reform is necessary and who would prefer not to see it poisoned by wounds that fester.\"\n\nYou move toward the door.\n\n\"Your uncle loves you. He does not know how to say so while also doing what he believes God requires of him. These things are not incompatible—but neither are they easy to hold together.\"\n\nCondulmer does not respond. But as you reach the door, his voice follows you:\n\n\"Your Majesty.\"\n\nYou turn.\n\n\"I will... think on what you have said. I make no promises. But I will think.\"\n\nYou nod and leave him to his dim room and his troubled thoughts. The seed is planted. Whether it grows remains to be seen.\n\nCardinal Giordano Orsini — Early Afternoon\n\nThe Orsini palazzo lies across the Tiber, a fortress-like structure that has housed one of Rome's two great families for generations. The walk takes you through streets that watch you pass—Romans who have heard rumors of yesterday's events, who see the Castilian king moving through their city with a small escort of knights.\n\nThe palazzo's majordomo receives you with elaborate courtesy—the Orsini have clearly been expecting contact. You are shown through halls hung with tapestries depicting Orsini victories, Orsini cardinals, Orsini popes. A family that has shaped Rome for centuries and intends to shape it for centuries more.\n\nCardinal Giordano Orsini receives you in a private study, richly appointed but not ostentatious. He is a man in his sixties, with the weathered face of someone who has survived Vatican politics for decades. His eyes are shrewd, assessing.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He bows correctly. \"I am honored by this visit. Please, sit. Wine?\"\n\nHe pours without waiting for an answer—a Roman vintage, excellent quality.\n\n\"I must confess some surprise,\" he says, settling into his own chair. \"I expected perhaps a summons to the Vatican. A formal interview with Parentucelli's investigators. Not a personal call from the King of Castile.\"\n\nHe sips his wine, watching you over the rim.\n\n\"You have spoken with His Holiness, I presume. And with that remarkable French cardinal who seems to have discovered a new vocation as bridge-builder.\" A thin smile. \"And now you come to see old Orsini. The family man. The survivor.\"\n\nHe sets down his cup.\n\n\"I have provided what assistance I can to the reform, Your Majesty. Information about Camera operations. Intelligence about which officials were most deeply involved. I have done this not from sudden conversion to righteousness—I think we can be honest with each other—but because I recognize which way the wind blows.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"Colonna fled. The French faction speaks of reconciliation. The Medici cooperate. The cardinals who knelt yesterday will not stand against a reform backed by five hundred Castilian knights and the evident favor of heaven.\" His smile sharpens. \"I am not a man who fights losing battles, Your Majesty. I am a man who adapts.\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"So. You have come to see me. What would you have of House Orsini?\"\n\nNPC ANALYSIS — Cardinal Orsini\n\nHis position (Roll 82: Valuable Cooperation):\n\nActively providing intelligence to help the reform\n\nBetraying his class to secure position in new order\n\nSelf-interested but genuinely useful\n\nWith Colonna fled, positioning himself as indispensable Roman aristocrat\n\nWhat he wants:\n\nAssurance that Orsini interests will be protected in reformed Church\n\nRecognition of his cooperation and its value\n\nContinued influence—different form, perhaps, but real\n\nTo understand Juan's intentions so he can position accordingly\n\nWhat he fears:\n\nThat cooperation will be accepted but not rewarded\n\nThat when Juan leaves, he will be vulnerable to those he betrayed\n\nThat the reform will fail and he will have made enemies for nothing\n\nThat Juan sees him as merely useful, not as potential partner\n\nWhat he offers:\n\nDeep knowledge of Roman politics and Vatican operations\n\nOrsini family resources and influence\n\nNetworks across Italian states\n\nThe legitimacy of having a great Roman house aligned with reform\n\nHis calculation:\nOrsini is transactional, not ideological. He cooperates because cooperation serves his interests. But transactional relationships can become genuine partnerships if both sides find ongoing value. He is testing Juan—determining whether this king understands how Rome actually works.\n\nThe cardinal waits, wine in hand, shrewd eyes patient. He has asked his question directly: What would you have of House Orsini?\n\nWhat do you say?"

Orsini, who initially cooperated with the reform (Roll 82), poses a critical question: what structural plan ensures the reform's survival after Juan sails for Constantinople? He catalogues the hollow internal support: passive cardinals, Parentucelli with no power base, an exhausted Pope, and no guarantee of sustained commitment. Roll 75 (Genuine Engagement): Orsini is genuinely trying to understand what he would be supporting long-term. However, Juan responds with an ultimatum rather than reassurance, stating 'Embrace this reform or not, I do not care' and threatening that any hostile action against the Pope would be treated as an act of war. Roll 5 (Cold Withdrawal): Orsini's expression closes immediately. The man who had been actively providing intelligence, betraying his class to aid the reform, is transformed into a cautious neutral offering only minimal compliance. He will not oppose the reform but will no longer volunteer information, assistance, or counsel. A valuable ally is lost through poor diplomatic approach, deepening the 'hollow center' that threatens the reform's survival after Juan's departure.",

This is actually a huge ask - Orsini has stuck his neck out, betrayed Colonna and others, and now Juan wants him to continue supporting a reform that will have lost its military backbone.\n\nOrsini is transactional. He rolled 82 (valuable cooperation) but that was based on calculation, not conviction. Now Juan is essentially asking him to take on more risk with less protection.\n\nThe key tension: Juan offers gratitude and remembrance. Orsini wants concrete commitments. Juan's offer is vague (\"I shall not forget it\"). Orsini will push for specifics.\n\nLet me draft the table with appropriate responses ranging from Orsini demanding too much/refusing, to cautious negotiation, to unexpected genuine commitment.\n\nNPC ANALYSIS — Cardinal Orsini\n\nWhat does this NPC want?\n\nConcrete guarantees, not vague gratitude\n\nSpecific commitments: protection for Orsini interests, influence over appointments, assurance that cooperation will be rewarded with tangible benefits\n\nTo understand what happens to him when the 591 knights sail east and he is left in Rome with enemies he has betrayed\n\nWhat won't he say?\n\nThat he is terrified of what happens when Juan leaves\n\nThat \"support\" without military backing is nearly worthless against determined opposition\n\nThat he has betrayed his class and needs protection from their revenge\n\nThat \"I shall not forget\" is politician's currency—worth nothing until spent\n\nThat he is calculating whether this reform survives long enough for his cooperation to matter\n\nD100 TABLE: Cardinal Orsini's Response\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCalculation revealed too nakedly. Orsini's mask slips. He laughs—not pleasantly. \"Count on Orsini support? Your Majesty, you ask me to hold a position after the army withdraws. What exactly do you offer in return for this... martyrdom?\" His demands are blunt, excessive, almost insulting. He has misjudged Juan or no longer cares to pretend. The conversation turns cold. Whatever cooperation existed becomes purely transactional, if it survives at all.\n6-15\nHard negotiation. Orsini sets down his wine. \"You shall not forget. A kind sentiment.\" His tone makes clear what he thinks of sentiments. \"When you sail to Constantinople, Your Majesty, I remain in Rome. With Colonna nursing grievance in the countryside. With cardinals who smiled yesterday and will remember who provided evidence against them. What specifically does Orsini receive for this continued loyalty?\" He wants concrete commitments before offering anything more.\n16-25\nPolite deflection. Orsini smiles warmly and says nothing of substance. \"House Orsini has always supported the Holy Father. We shall continue to do so, as we have for generations.\" The words are correct; the commitment is vapor. He is leaving himself room to adapt if circumstances change. Juan has received courtesy, not alliance.\n26-40\nProbing questions. Orsini does not answer directly. Instead, he asks: \"When you sail, Your Majesty—how many knights remain? Who commands them? What authority will they have?\" He is assessing the reform's strength after Juan's departure. His support depends on the answers. He will commit to nothing until he understands what he is committing to.\n41-55\nConditional interest. \"The Orsini have survived in Rome for centuries by understanding where power lies,\" he says carefully. \"You ask if we will support the Pope. The question is whether the Pope will be in a position to be supported—or whether he will need to be... protected from those who resent what has occurred.\" He implies he might help, but wants to know what resources will remain and what role Orsini might play.\n56-70\nTesting the waters. Orsini leans forward. \"I remember our first meeting as well, Your Majesty. You were young then. Uncertain. I see you have grown into certainty.\" A pause. \"What does certainty offer House Orsini? Not gratitude—gratitude fades. Not promises—promises are broken. What concrete assurance can you provide that when you sail east, those who cooperated with reform will not find themselves abandoned to the vengeance of those who did not?\"\n71-80\nGenuine engagement beneath the calculation. Orsini is quiet for a moment, something shifting behind his eyes. \"You speak of Constantinople. Of sailing east to face the Turk while leaving this reform in... whose hands, exactly? Parentucelli? The passive cardinals? My family, perhaps?\" His questions are pointed but not hostile. He is genuinely trying to understand the plan—because if there is a real plan, he might genuinely commit to it.\n81-90\nUnexpected candor. Orsini sets down his wine and looks at Juan with something approaching honesty. \"I will tell you something I would not tell His Holiness, Your Majesty. This reform survives on your knights and your reputation. When you leave, it survives on...\" He spreads his hands. \"What? Faith? The goodwill of cardinals who knelt yesterday and today cannot remember why?\" He is not refusing—he is asking Juan to solve a problem they both see.\n91-95\nPartnership proposed. Orsini's calculation has produced an unexpected result. \"You need someone in Rome when you sail. Someone with resources, with networks, with the ability to act when action is needed. Not a commoner with a commission—a family that has held Rome for centuries.\" He is not asking for payment. He is proposing a role. \"Tell me what you need House Orsini to do, Your Majesty. Not just support. Do.\"\n96-100\nGenuine transformation. Something in Juan's manner—the reference to their first meeting, the directness, the vision of Constantinople—reaches past Orsini's calculation to something older. He is quiet for a long moment. \"I was young once too, Your Majesty. I believed in things. Then I learned how Rome works, and belief seemed... inefficient.\" He looks at his wine. \"Perhaps I learned the wrong lesson.\" He asks not what Orsini will receive, but what the reform actually needs. The conversation shifts from transaction to possibility.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

If not, he needs to hedge his bets.\n\nWhat he won't say: That he's more frightened than he appears. That his \"cooperation\" so far has been calculated hedging, not commitment. That he genuinely doesn't know if backing this reform will save him or doom him.\n\nThe roll indicates genuine engagement - he's actually trying to solve the problem with Juan, not just extract guarantees. But he's still Orsini - still calculating, still protecting himself. The engagement is real, but so is the self-interest underneath.\n\nORSINI RESULT: 75 — Genuine Engagement Beneath the Calculation\n\nOrsini is quiet for a moment. He swirls the wine in his cup, watching the dark liquid catch the light from the window. When he speaks, his voice has lost some of its practiced smoothness.\n\n\"You speak of Constantinople. Of sailing east to face the Turk.\"\n\nHe sets down the cup.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am not a young man. I have watched three pontificates. I have seen reforms proclaimed and reforms forgotten. I have seen men of genuine conviction ground down by the machinery of this city until they became what they once opposed.\"\n\nHe rises, moving to the window. Rome spreads out below—the ancient city that his family has helped rule for centuries.\n\n\"You ask if you can count on Orsini support when you travel on. A fair question. Let me ask one in return.\"\n\nHe turns back to face you.\n\n\"When you sail east—and you will sail, because you are the man you appear to be—this reform remains in whose hands, exactly?\"\n\nHe raises a finger before you can respond.\n\n\"Parentucelli. Yes. A brilliant man. Incorruptible, perhaps. But he is a secretary with a commission. He has no family, no army, no network of obligations built over generations. He has authority because the Pope granted it and because your knights enforce it.\"\n\nA second finger.\n\n\"The Pope himself. Eugenius. A man who spent three years paralyzed by fear and found courage for one extraordinary day. Will that courage last? When you are a thousand miles away and the cardinals begin to whisper, when the Camera clerks slow their compliance to a crawl, when Colonna returns from the countryside with new allies—will Eugenius hold firm? Or will he discover that survival is easier than righteousness?\"\n\nA third finger.\n\n\"The cardinals who knelt. I was in the consistory, Your Majesty. I watched them agree to everything and commit to nothing. They are waiting. Waiting to see if this reform survives long enough to matter. If it does, they will claim they always supported it. If it does not...\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"So. You ask if you can count on Orsini support. I ask you: support for what, precisely? A reform built on one man's knights and one man's faith? What happens to that reform—and to those who backed it—when the knights sail east and the faith is tested by distance?\"\n\nHe returns to his chair, sitting heavily.\n\n\"I am not refusing you, Your Majesty. I am asking you to show me what I would be supporting. Not the vision—I heard the vision yesterday, and it was magnificent. I am asking about the structure. The plan. The mechanism by which this reform survives your departure.\"\n\nHis eyes are sharp, but there is something genuine beneath the calculation now.\n\n\"Because if there is such a plan—if you have thought beyond the golden moment to the grey years that follow—then perhaps House Orsini commits not just cooperation, but genuine partnership. We have resources. Networks. The ability to act when action is needed, through channels that do not require five hundred knights.\"\n\nHe picks up his wine again.\n\n\"But if the plan is 'trust in God and hope for the best'...\" A slight shrug. \"Then I smile, and I nod, and I provide what assistance costs me little, and I prepare for the day when this reform joins all the others that Rome has absorbed and forgotten.\"\n\nHe waits, watching you with eyes that have seen too much to believe easily—but perhaps not so much that belief is impossible.\n\n\"What is the plan, Your Majesty? When you sail for Constantinople, what holds this together?\""

When you sail for Constantinople, what holds this together?\"\n\n**How did Juan answer?**\nJuan didn't really answer the structural question. Instead, he:\n1. Acknowledged his youth/success\n2. Listed external support (Emperor, Basel expected)\n3. Threatened consequences for opposition\n4. Said the plan is Basel signs, Tommaso does his job, no violence unless provoked\n\n**NPC Guide Analysis:**\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- Juan has real power (591 knights)\n- External support is genuine (Emperor, potentially Basel)\n- The threat is credible - Juan has proven military capability\n- Juan is direct and honest about his position\n- He's not asking Orsini to betray his identity - just to not obstruct\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- Juan didn't answer Orsini's actual question about structural sustainability\n- Orsini asked \"what holds this together when you leave\" - Juan said \"Basel signs decree, Tommaso works, I react to violence\"\n- This is not a structural plan - it's hope dressed as threats\n- Orsini is a survivor who sees through political theater\n- The threat feels like bullying - \"support us or face war\"\n\nI see critical diplomatic missteps in Juan's approach. His dismissive stance toward Orsini undermines potential collaboration. By treating a valuable intelligence source as a potential adversary, Juan risks alienating a key ally who has already demonstrated significant cooperation. The response suggests a lack of strategic nuance, potentially jeopardizing the delicate political landscape they're navigating.\n\nOrsini's core concern revolves around personal security after Juan's departure. Instead of offering reassurance or a concrete plan, Juan delivers an ultimatum that feels more like a threat than a partnership. This approach fails to address Orsini's fundamental need for protection after taking substantial risks.\n\nThe interaction reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of alliance dynamics. Orsini has already committed significant resources and personal reputation by providing intelligence, yet receives no reciprocal commitment or guarantee of safety. Juan's approach suggests a transactional view that could ultimately backfire, potentially pushing Orsini toward recalculating his allegiances.\n\nDespite recognizing Juan's genuine power - 591 knights underscore his credibility - Orsini is weighing whether this reform can truly survive. The proposed strategy seems more like wishful thinking than a robust plan, leaving Orsini to contemplate whether hedging his bets might be the most prudent path forward.\n\nHis potential reactions range from cautious compliance to measured skepticism. While he won't openly challenge the king, he's unlikely to invest full enthusiasm given the threatening and dismissive interaction. Orsini will likely maintain a surface-level cooperation while privately reserving judgment about the reform's long-term viability.\n\nThe key tension remains: he's already betrayed his class, yet receives no substantive reassurance about structural sustainability. His survival instinct suggests staying nominally aligned without deep commitment, protecting himself while waiting to see how events unfold.\n\nNPC ANALYSIS — Orsini's Reception of Juan's Response\n\nWhat did Orsini ask?\n\"What IS the plan? When you sail for Constantinople, what holds this together?\"\n\nA genuine question about structural sustainability from a man who has already committed to cooperation and wants to understand what he's supporting.\n\nWhat did Juan answer?\n\nExternal support exists (Emperor, expected Basel endorsement)\n\nBinary choice: ally or oppose\n\nOpposition = war with Castile\n\n\"Embrace this reform or not, I do not care\"\n\nThe plan: Basel signs, Tommaso works, no violence unless provoked\n\nWhat Orsini is hearing:\n\nHis legitimate question about structure was not answered\n\nHe has already cooperated—provided intelligence, betrayed his class\n\nIn return, he receives threats and dismissal (\"I do not care\")\n\nThe \"plan\" is hope dressed as ultimatum\n\nThe young king treats a current ally as a potential enemy\n\nSuccess Factors:\n\nJuan's power is real and credible\n\nThe external support is genuine\n\nJuan's directness signals he means what he says\n\nThe threat of war is not bluster—Juan conquered Granada\n\nFailure Factors:\n\nDid not answer the actual question about sustainability\n\nThreatening someone who is already cooperating\n\n\"I do not care\" dismisses a man who has risked much\n\nNo concrete protection offered for when Juan leaves\n\nTreats ally as suspect rather than partner\n\nThe \"plan\" has no structural mechanism—just hope that Basel cooperates and no one attacks\n\nApproach Quality: POOR\nJuan had a cooperating ally who asked a reasonable question. He responded with threats and dismissal instead of reassurance and partnership. This is not how you cement alliances.\n\nD100 TABLE: Orsini's Response to Juan's Ultimatum\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-5\nCold withdrawal. Orsini's expression closes completely. \"I see. Thank you for clarifying Your Majesty's position.\" He rises, the audience clearly over. Juan has transformed a cooperating ally into a cautious neutral at best. Orsini will maintain minimal compliance—he's not foolish enough to oppose openly—but the intelligence, the active assistance, the genuine engagement ends today. He will hedge his bets and wait to see if this reform survives its creator's departure.\n6-15\nWounded calculation. \"You do not care,\" Orsini repeats slowly. \"I have provided intelligence that cost me relationships built over decades. I have betrayed men who trusted me. And Your Majesty... does not care.\" He masters himself. \"I understand. House Orsini will not oppose the reform. You have made the consequences of opposition clear.\" His cooperation continues, but something has curdled. He will do what is required and nothing more.\n16-25\nPolite distance. Orsini nods slowly, his face unreadable. \"Your Majesty speaks plainly. I appreciate clarity.\" But he does not commit to anything beyond what he has already given. He does not offer more. He asks no more questions. The conversation has become transactional—Orsini will cooperate because the alternative is worse, not because he believes in the cause or trusts the king who champions it.\n26-40\nGuarded acceptance. \"I asked what holds this together when you leave,\" Orsini says quietly. \"You have told me: threat of Castilian war. That is... an answer.\" He is not satisfied, but he is not foolish. He accepts the terms as stated. House Orsini will support the reform while Juan's knights remain in Italy. What happens after Constantinople remains unspoken. He has made no promise about the long term.\n41-55\nPragmatic realism. Orsini is silent for a long moment. Then: \"You are young, Your Majesty. And successful. Perhaps you are right that success is its own answer.\" He does not apologize for his question, but he accepts that Juan will not—or cannot—answer it. \"House Orsini chose its side when I provided intelligence to Parentucelli. That choice stands. I merely wished to understand what I had chosen.\" He will continue cooperating, but without illusion about partnership.\n56-70\nRespect beneath the sting. \"You do not care whether I embrace the reform,\" Orsini repeats. A thin smile. \"And yet you came to my home. You asked for my support. You speak of counting me among allies.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"You are not a diplomat, Your Majesty. But perhaps that is... refreshing.\" He decides Juan's bluntness, however clumsy, signals genuine conviction. He will commit more than minimal cooperation—but he will remember this conversation.\n71-80\nTesting accepted. Orsini studies Juan with new assessment. \"You have told me you will make war on those who oppose the reform. You have told me you keep your word. You have not told me what happens when you sail east—but perhaps that is because you do not know yourself.\" A pause. \"An honest answer, even if not the one I sought.\" He decides Juan's uncertainty about the future is more trustworthy than false assurances would have been. He commits to continued active support.\n81-90\nConviction recognized. Something in Juan's directness—the refusal to pretend, the willingness to threaten openly rather than manipulate subtly—reaches past Orsini's calculation. \"You truly believe this reform will survive,\" he says slowly. \"Not because you have a plan. Because you will make it survive through sheer force of will.\" He considers this. \"I have bet on worse foundations.\" He offers something more: specific assistance, not just intelligence. Names of men who might be trusted. Approaches that might work.\n91-95\nUnexpected respect. Orsini laughs—genuine, surprised. \"You have spent an hour in my house and told me you do not care what I think, threatened me with war, and offered no assurance of protection. And somehow...\" He shakes his head. \"Somehow I find myself more committed than when you arrived. You are either the worst diplomat in Christendom or the most effective.\" He rises, extends his hand. \"Tell me what you need House Orsini to do, Your Majesty. Not just support. Do.\"\n96-100\nPartnership forged despite everything. The ultimatum that should have offended instead clarifies. Orsini sees a man who does not play games, does not flatter, does not manipulate—who says what he means and means what he says. In a lifetime of Vatican politics, this is rarer than gold. \"I asked the wrong question,\" Orsini admits. \"I asked what holds this together when you leave. I should have asked what I can do to ensure it holds.\" He commits House Orsini not just to cooperation but to active partnership. When Juan sails, Orsini will be among those who remain to guard what was built.\n\nReady for the roll when you are."

He sets down his wine cup with deliberate precision. When he speaks, his voice has lost all warmth—not hostile, but empty. The voice of a man conducting necessary business.\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nHe rises from his chair. The movement is unhurried but final—the audience is over.\n\n\"Thank you for clarifying Your Majesty's position.\"\n\nHe moves toward the door of the study, clearly expecting you to follow. The walk back through the Orsini palazzo feels different now. The tapestries depicting family glories seem less like welcome and more like reminder: We were here before you. We will be here after.\n\nAt the entrance, Orsini pauses. His face remains composed—a lifetime of Vatican politics has taught him to reveal nothing.\n\n\"House Orsini will not oppose the reform,\" he says. \"Your Majesty has made the consequences of opposition quite clear. We are not fools.\"\n\nA servant appears with your cloak.\n\n\"The intelligence I have provided to Parentucelli stands. It is accurate. It will serve the investigation.\" He pauses. \"I do not believe I have anything further to offer that would be of value. House Orsini has other matters requiring attention.\"\n\nHe bows—correctly, precisely, without a degree more warmth than protocol demands.\n\n\"God grant Your Majesty success in Constantinople. I am certain the reform will... proceed as it will proceed.\"\n\nThe doors of the Orsini palazzo close behind you.\n\nCONSEQUENCES:\n\nThe alliance that rolled 82—valuable cooperation, providing intelligence, betraying his class to secure position in the new order—has curdled into something far less.\n\nWhat you have lost:\n\nActive intelligence gathering on Vatican politics\n\nOrsini's networks and influence working for the reform\n\nA Roman aristocrat genuinely engaged in making reform succeed\n\nFuture assistance when complications arise\n\nA potential partner for the period after you sail east\n\nWhat remains:\n\nMinimal compliance—Orsini will not actively oppose\n\nThe intelligence already provided—it doesn't disappear\n\nFear of Castilian retaliation keeping him from joining opposition\n\nWhat has changed:\n\nOrsini will do what is required and nothing more\n\nHe will not volunteer information, assistance, or counsel\n\nHe will wait and watch, hedging his bets\n\nIf the reform falters after Juan leaves, Orsini will adapt accordingly\n\nHe has made no promise about the long term\n\nTHE UPDATED TALLY:\n\nFaction\nRoll\nInitial Result\nCurrent Status\nColonna\n16\nFlight to safety\nUnchanged—absent from Rome\nOrsini\n82→5\nValuable cooperation\nWithdrawn to minimal compliance\nFrench Faction\n99\nGenuine conversion\nUnchanged—preparing for Basel journey\nMedici Bank\n74\nValuable partnership\nUnchanged—providing records\nCamera Officials\n10\nFlight of most guilty\nUnchanged—gaps in evidence\nCardinal Condulmer\n7→26\nBitter confrontation\nSlightly softened—will \"think on it\"\nReform Cardinals\n9\nSymbolic without substance\nUnchanged—passive\nPallavicini\n9\nGrowing doubt\nUnchanged—adequate but unenthusiastic\n\nThe reform's internal support continues to erode. Condulmer is slightly better; Orsini is significantly worse. The external support (Emperor's expected endorsement, Basel reconciliation) remains strong, but the hollow center Rochetaillée identified grows hollower.\n\nThe Roman afternoon stretches before you. Your knights wait in the Vatican courtyard. Parentucelli labors in the Camera. Eugenius manages passive cardinals. Lucia sails toward Naples with your daughter.\n\nAnd you have just transformed a valuable ally into a cautious neutral.\n\nWhat do you do?"

Rochetaillée's conversion (roll 99)\n4. But weak internal Church support - passive cardinals (roll 9), doubtful guards (roll 9), wounded nephew (roll 7→26)\n5.

This sets up major tensions for future chapters as Juan must decide whether to address this before sailing to Constantinople.\n\nThe Chapter 2.21 summary is ready for download.\n\nChapter Overview:\n\nThis was a chapter of extraordinary contrasts. The Mass at St. Peter's (roll 100) produced something genuinely miraculous—golden light, weeping cardinals, a king's oath that shook the basilica. The letters to Christian monarchs (roll 85) catalyzed European-wide support. Rochetaillée's conversion (roll 99) turned a French faction leader into a bridge-builder.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nThe internal Church support crumbled throughout the day. The cardinals who knelt provided symbolic commitment only (roll 9). The Pope's nephew withdrew in bitter grievance (roll 7). The guards grew doubtful (roll 9). And the conversation with Orsini—a man who was actively helping—transformed valuable cooperation into cold withdrawal (roll 82→5) because an ultimatum was delivered where reassurance was needed.\n\nThe central tension going forward:\n\nThe reform has won Christendom but may be losing Rome. When Juan sails for Constantinople, what holds the hollow center together? That question remains unanswered—and increasingly urgent.\n\nFile: /home/claude/Chapter_2_21_Summary.md"

          "text": "**The Amazing Rolls:**\n- Mass at St. Peter's: 100 (Providence) - This was the critical moment. The announcement of reforms could have gone terribly wrong. Instead, it became transcendent.\n- French Faction (Rochetaillée): 99 (Genuine Conversion) - Incredible. The man who was supposed to be the opposition became a bridge-builder.\n- Letters to Christian Monarchs: 85 (Diplomatic Triumph) - Strong European support.\n- Orsini: 82 (Valuable Cooperation) - Initially great, then squandered.\n- Medici Bank: 74 (Valuable Partnership) - Solid support.\n\n**The Terrible Rolls:**\n- Cardinal Condulmer: 7 (Bitter Confrontation) - The Pope's nephew became a wound.\n- Reform Cardinals: 9 (Symbolic Without Substance) - The cardinals who knelt didn't follow through.\n- Pallavicini: 9 (Growing Doubt) - The guards lost conviction.\n- Camera Officials: 10 (Flight of Most Guilty) - Evidence lost.\n- Orsini conversation: 5 (Cold Withdrawal) - A valuable ally lost through poor approach.\n- Consistory: 35 (Passive Acceptance) - Not terrible but not good.\n- Condulmer conversation: 26 (Painful Honesty) - Slightly better but still wounded.\n\n**The Pattern:**\nThe external factions rolled incredibly well. The internal Church factions rolled terribly. This created a fascinating narrative situation - the reform has won the world but may be losing Rome itself.\n\nThe 100 on the Mass was indeed perfectly timed. If that had been a low roll, the whole reform might have collapsed before it started. \n\nThe pivotal Mass moment transformed potential failure into a profound spiritual breakthrough. The 100 roll ensured the reform's message resonated deeply, creating an unexpected moment of genuine spiritual connection that gave the movement unprecedented legitimacy and power. However, the player's strategic misstep with Orsini revealed the fragility of these hard-won alliances, demonstrating how a single poorly conceived interaction could unravel carefully built relationships.\n\nGM Reflection: The Dice Tell a Story\n\nWhat a chapter. Those rolls created something I couldn't have planned—a narrative that's dramatically perfect in its contradictions.\n\nThe Miracle Rolls:\n\nThe 100 on the Mass was genuinely extraordinary timing. That was THE moment where everything could have fallen apart. Imagine if you'd rolled a 5 there—Rochetaillée denouncing Spanish tyranny mid-ceremony, cardinals refusing to kneel, the whole thing collapsing into factional warfare before it began. Instead, you got golden light and weeping cardinals and a moment that witnesses will speak of for generations.\n\nThen Rochetaillée's 99—I actually laughed when you rolled that. The French faction leader, the man who spent eight years fighting papal authority, experiencing genuine conversion? That's the kind of thing that would feel like GM favoritism if I'd written it deliberately. But the dice made it happen, and now you have the architect of opposition becoming a bridge to Basel.\n\nAnd 85 on the European monarchs—transforming a Roman reform into a Christendom-wide movement. Sigismund endorsing, France joining rather than opposing. That's the external legitimacy that could sustain this reform for decades.\n\nThe Brutal Internal Rolls:\n\nBut then look at what happened inside Rome:\n\nCondulmer: 7 — The Pope's own nephew, wounded and withdrawn\n\nReform Cardinals: 9 — Public commitment, zero follow-through\n\nPallavicini: 9 — The guards sensing doubt\n\nCamera Officials: 10 — The worst actors escaping with evidence\n\nThe dice created exactly what Rochetaillée identified: the hollow center. You won the world but the institution itself is rotting from within. The cardinals who knelt in the golden light went home and calculated how to protect themselves. The Pope's family is fractured. The guards are going through the motions.\n\nThe Orsini Tragedy:\n\nThis one hurts to reflect on because it wasn't just dice—it was approach meeting dice.\n\nOrsini rolled 82 initially. He was genuinely helping. Betraying his class, providing real intelligence, positioning himself as a partner. And he asked a reasonable question: \"What's the plan for when you leave?\"\n\nThe ultimatum approach—\"I do not care whether you embrace the reform\"—was exactly wrong for someone who was already cooperating and needed reassurance, not threats. The 5 that followed was the dice punishing a poor approach to a willing ally.\n\nThat's the NPC realism system working as intended, but it still stings. You had something valuable and it slipped away.\n\nThe Narrative Logic:\n\nWhat fascinates me is how the dice created a thematically coherent situation:\n\nExternal Success / Internal Failure\n\nThe reform has conquered Christendom. Emperors endorse it. French cardinals convert. Bankers cooperate. Kings send letters of support.\n\nBut inside the Vatican, inside Rome, inside the institution that must actually implement these changes—doubt, grievance, passive resistance, hollow commitment.\n\nThis is historically realistic. Reforms often win battles and lose wars because the institution absorbs them. The men who must implement change wait for the reformers to leave, then quietly return to old ways. The dice gave you exactly that challenge.\n\nThe Unanswered Question:\n\nRochetaillée asked it. Orsini asked it. Now you must answer it:\n\nWhen Juan sails for Constantinople, what holds this together?\n\nYou have:\n\nParentucelli (brilliant, incorruptible, but a commoner with no power base)\n\nEugenius (courageous for one day, exhausted the next, nephew's love as casualty)\n\nFray Hernando (maybe, if he agrees to stay)\n\nExternal pressure from European monarchs\n\n591 knights who will sail east with you\n\nYou don't have:\n\nActive cardinal support\n\nOrsini's networks\n\nA healed Condulmer\n\nConfident guards\n\nA structural mechanism beyond \"trust in God and threaten war\"\n\nThe next chapter will test whether faith and external pressure are enough—or whether the hollow center consumes everything when the knights sail east.\n\nFinal Thought:\n\nThat 100 on the Mass bought you something priceless: a moment so transcendent that even when everything else went wrong, the memory of it remains. Cardinals who provide symbolic support only still knelt in golden light. That memory can be invoked, recalled, used as leverage. \"You knelt before God and man. Will you now betray that oath?\"\n\nThe miracle gave you moral authority. Whether that's enough to fill the hollow center... that's the story of the chapters to come."
