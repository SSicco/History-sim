From the corridors come the sounds of servants beginning their duties - footsteps, quiet voices, the distant clatter of dishes being prepared for the morning meal. The intimate cocoon of night has dissolved into the demands of day.\n\nIsabel stands beside the bed, already moving toward her dressing chamber. She pauses at the doorway and glances back, her expression soft but tinged with something else now - duty reasserting itself over the vulnerability of moments before.\n\n\"Álvaro will want to see you,\" she says quietly. \"He's been managing everything while you were gone. Nine months is a long time.\" A small smile. \"And there will be a hundred nobles wanting audiences, reports from Granada, decisions to make about...\" She trails off, gesturing vaguely at the enormity of post-conquest administration.\n\nFrom beyond the door comes a knock - respectful, but firm. A servant's voice, carefully neutral: \"Your Majesty? Don Álvaro de Luna requests audience at your convenience. He says there are urgent matters requiring the King's attention.\"\n\nIsabel meets your eyes one more time, and there's understanding there. Yesterday was yours. Today belongs to the kingdom.\n\nWhat do you do?"

Just get to Álvaro explaining what needs attention, then stop.\n\nIsabel's cheeks color slightly at your words, but she nods with a mixture of anticipation and nervousness. \"This afternoon then,\" she says softly, then slips into her dressing chamber.\n\nYou dress quickly and make your way through the familiar corridors of the Alcázar. Servants bow as you pass, their faces showing relief and pride - their king home victorious after nine months away. The palace feels different than when you left it, somehow both more orderly and more subdued.\n\nÁlvaro waits in your private study, and the sight of him brings a rush of warmth. Your closest advisor looks older - new lines around his eyes, a weariness that wasn't there before - but his bearing is as steady as ever. He rises and bows deeply.\n\n\"Your Majesty. Welcome home.\" His voice carries genuine emotion. \"Nine months. Christ, Juan, it's good to see you alive and whole.\"\n\nHe gestures to the table where several documents are arranged with his characteristic precision. \"I've tried to keep things running smoothly, but there are matters that require your personal attention now that you've returned. Some are urgent, others can wait, but you should know about all of them.\"\n\nHe picks up the first document. \"Most pressing: the Cortes. They're expecting formal dissolution and final accounting of the crusade tax. We collected approximately 2.4 million maravedís over the eighteen months - slightly less than projected due to some estates claiming hardship exemptions. The nobles will want to know when the tax authority expires and what happens to any surplus funds.\"\n\nHe sets that aside and picks up another. \"Second: Granada's outlying territories. Don García reports that most have submitted peacefully, but there are three fortress commanders in the Sierra Nevada mountains who haven't responded to his messengers. They may be waiting to see if you'll actually enforce your authority, or they may be preparing resistance. We need to decide how to handle them.\"\n\nA third document. \"Third: the Military Orders want to know their role going forward. The Masters of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara have sent formal inquiries about whether you're disbanding the crusade army entirely or maintaining some force for garrison duties. Related to that - what happens to the crusaders? Their oaths are fulfilled. Do we send them home? Offer continued service?\"\n\nHe pauses, studying your face. \"And there's a fourth matter, but it's... delicate. The Archbishop of Toledo has been making inquiries about Queen Isabel's health and the succession. He's heard about the difficult birth and is concerned about the need for a male heir. He hasn't said anything publicly, but he's been asking me questions I didn't feel comfortable answering without speaking to you first.\"\n\nÁlvaro sets down the documents and looks at you directly. \"Where would you like to start?\""

He wants a peaceful approach to the Sierra Nevada forts - summoning them to Granada rather than military action\n4. He's showing patience and understanding for their situation\n\nÁlvaro would likely have some thoughts on each of these points. Let me respond as Álvaro with his characteristic blend of support and practical counsel.\n\nI should not write Juan's dialogue or actions - just Álvaro's response to what Juan said.\n\nÁlvaro's eyebrows rise slightly, but he nods with growing understanding. \"Not done. Of course.\" He picks up a quill and begins making notes. \"The bull authorizes perpetual crusade, and Granada's conquest is just the first phase. You're thinking ahead - consolidation, perhaps North Africa eventually?\"\n\nHe taps the quill against his chin thoughtfully. \"The Cortes did approve two years minimum, you're right. Though I should warn you - some nobles will grumble. They fulfilled their military obligations, came home expecting tax relief, and now we're telling them another year of payments. Legally sound, yes. Politically, we'll need to manage expectations carefully.\"\n\nA slight smile. \"But we've managed worse. And the fact that Granada is actually conquered - that the tax achieved exactly what you promised - gives you enormous credibility. They can't claim the funds were wasted or the crusade a failure.\"\n\nHe makes another note. \"I'll prepare formal statements for both matters. The Cortes will be informed that crusade authority remains active, tax collection continues through 1433 as approved, and any surplus funds are retained for ongoing crusade operations.\"\n\nOn the Sierra Nevada question, Álvaro nods approvingly. \"Wise. Patient. Shows strength without provocation.\" He considers. \"A formal summons to Granada - perhaps with Don García extending personal invitations? He's the governor, he represents your authority there. We could frame it as... an assembly of all fortress commanders to swear fealty and receive confirmation of their positions. Make it an honor rather than a demand.\"\n\nHe glances up. \"Do we offer amnesty for the delay? Make it clear that those who come peacefully will be received graciously, while those who continue to refuse...\"  He leaves the implication hanging. \"Carrot and stick, but leading with the carrot.\"\n\nWhat do you say?"

However, the user has advanced research enabled, so according to my instructions, I should use the launch_extended_search_task tool instead, as it takes priority.\n\nBut wait - let me check the instructions more carefully. The research instructions say to use launch_extended_search_task for \"all queries except for (1) the most basic conversational messages (like \"hi claude\") or (2) extremely simple questions (like \"what's the weather\").\"\n\nThis is definitely not a basic conversational message or extremely simple question. It's a complex research task requiring comprehensive analysis of multiple documents.\n\nHowever, I should also check the project knowledge instructions: \"Claude MUST prioritize using the `project_knowledge_search` tool to find answers above all other tools. Claude should almost always use the project knowledge, and should default to assuming that the answers to user questions are in project knowledge.\"\n\nThere's a potential conflict here. Let me look at the priority order:\n- The research instructions say they \"take priority over ALL other tools\"\n- But they also say to use it \"except for\" basic messages or simple questions\n- The project knowledge instructions say to prioritize it \"above all other tools\"\n\nActually, reading more carefully: the research instructions say \"These research instructions take absolute priority and should always be followed.\" And specifically: \"PRIORITY INSTRUCTION: USE ONLY THE LAUNCH EXTENDED SEARCH TOOL IN THIS CHAT! Do not use ANY other tools, even if they are available.\"\n\nSo it seems clear: I should use launch_extended_search_task for this request.\n\nI need to pause and carefully consider the specific requirements of this financial document. The task involves deep analysis of project files, which suggests I should clarify the exact scope and expectations before proceeding. \n\nI'll prepare targeted questions to ensure I capture all the nuanced details the user wants in the financial overview. My key focus will be understanding the precise timeframe, specific financial categories, and the level of detail required in the final document.\n\nThe clarifying questions will help me create a more precise and useful financial analysis that meets the user's exact needs.\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"Graceful it is. Don García can frame it as gathering all commanders together - a ceremony of incorporation into Castile, recognition of their continued authority under new sovereignty. We'll make them feel valued.\"\n\nHe sets that document aside. \"Now, the treasury situation. That's... extensive.\" He pauses. \"This will take some careful accounting. The crusade tax and crown revenues have evolved significantly since you restructured everything.\"\n\nI need to do some thorough research through the project files to give you accurate figures. Before I dive in, a few questions to make sure I capture what you need:\n\nTime Period: Should the new budget document project revenues for calendar year 1433, or follow the campaign season pattern (e.g., through the 1433 campaign season)?\n\nRevenue Estimates: For the newly granted Granada titles and improved crown land administration - should I estimate their revenue contributions based on typical yields, or note them as \"pending first assessment\"? You mentioned regular revenue assessments in the new feudal contracts.\n\nDetail Level: Do you want separate line items for major revenue sources (each confiscated estate, each new Granada title, etc.), or broader categories with subtotals?\n\nOnce you clarify these points, I'll compile everything from the project files into a comprehensive financial document."

Detailed first, then we can see the forest for the trees.\" He rolls up his sleeves. \"This will take a few hours - I need to compile everything from the original crusade budget documents, the Cortes agreements, records from the confiscated estates, the new feudal contracts...\"\n\nHe pauses. \"Actually, Your Majesty, this would go faster if I had Diego's help - he's been tracking the actual collections while you were in Granada. And I'll need access to the campaign budgets from 1431 and 1432, the crusade tax law we passed in the Cortes, and records of the new Granada titles you granted.\"\n\nHe stands, already organizing the work in his mind. \"Give me until this evening. I'll prepare a comprehensive document - current structure, all revenue sources detailed out, then 1433 projections. We'll see exactly where we stand financially: what the crusade treasury looks like after eighteen months of campaigning, what the crown treasury holds, and what we can expect for the coming year.\"\n\nA slight smile. \"Though I suspect you'll be pleased. The 8% feudal contracts from those confiscated estates - that was brilliant. Higher revenue than the old arrangements, and it sets a precedent for modernizing all feudal contracts over time. And the Granada titles...\" He shakes his head appreciatively. \"You've essentially doubled Castile's territory and tax base in a single campaign. Even with the adjustment period, that's extraordinary.\"\n\nHe begins gathering documents. \"This evening then, Your Majesty. I'll have the full financial picture ready for you.\"\n\nTime passes - approximately 6 hours\n\nEvening, Same Day - November 29, 1432\n\nÁlvaro returns to your study as promised, accompanied by Diego de Daza carrying several ledgers. They spread documents across your table with the systematic precision of experienced administrators.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Álvaro begins, setting down a thick folio. \"The complete financial analysis you requested. I've organized it into two separate documents - one for the Crusade Treasury and operations, one for the Crown Treasury and revenues.\"\n\nHe taps the first document. \"Let's start with the crusade, since that's what drove everything.\"\n\nLet me research and compile these documents now.\n\nCreate File: Creating comprehensive financial analysis document for crusade and crown treasuries as of November 1432 with 1433 projections\n\nThought process\n\nPerfect! Now I need to copy this file to the outputs directory so the user can access it, and then return to the narrative as Álvaro presenting this to Juan.\n\nGood! Now I'll continue the narrative with Álvaro presenting the document to Juan and explaining the key findings.\n\nÁlvaro slides the thick folio across the table toward you. The document is meticulously organized, Diego's neat handwriting filling dozens of pages with tables, calculations, and projections.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Álvaro begins, tapping the summary page, \"I've separated everything as you requested - crusade funds completely distinct from crown revenues. Let me walk you through the essential findings.\"\n\nHe opens to the first section. \"The crusade treasury stands at approximately 388,000 florins. That's after spending 142,000 florins in 1431 and 170,000 in 1432 - two full campaign seasons. The foreign aid windfall from October 1431 gave us unprecedented resources. Even with Granada's complete conquest, we're left with reserves that could fund another three or four years of major operations if needed.\"\n\nDiego adds from his position with the ledgers: \"The taxation revenue has been... adequate. About 41,000 florins total over two years. Not as much as we'd hoped due to noble resistance, but the Crown Marshal system dramatically improved compliance in 1432.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"For 1433, assuming no major military campaign, we project stable crusade treasury - perhaps 380,000 to 390,000 florins by year's end. Garrison costs, administrative overhead, but nothing dramatic.\"\n\nHe turns to the crown treasury section. \"This is where it gets interesting, Your Majesty. The crown treasury currently holds about 189,000 florins - and it's growing.\"\n\nHe points to a detailed table. \"When you took power, crown revenues were about 30 million maravedís annually - roughly 113,000 florins. We're now projecting 133,000 florins for 1433. That's nearly 20% growth.\"\n\n\"Where's it coming from?\" you ask.\n\n\"Three sources,\" Álvaro counts on his fingers. \"First, the confiscated rebel estates. Niebla, Medina, Sotomayor - you returned them to the heirs under 10% feudal contracts instead of the old 1% arrangements. That alone adds about 400 florins annually. Small, but it's the precedent that matters.\n\n\"Second, the Infantes' estates. When they renounced their claims, those properties came under direct crown administration. That's 800,000 maravedís - about 3,000 florins - annually that was flowing to them and now flows to you.\n\n\"Third - and this is the big one - Diego's administrative reforms are working.\" He gestures to the treasurer. \"Reduced tax farming corruption, updated crown land assessments, better debt collection. We estimate 3.4 million maravedís in annual improvements once fully implemented. We're at about 30% implementation now, but even that's adding significant revenue.\"\n\nDiego speaks up: \"The key insight, Your Majesty, is that these aren't one-time gains. They're permanent structural improvements. Every year going forward, the crown collects more efficiently.\"\n\nÁlvaro turns to the Granada section. \"And then there's the conquered territory. I've been conservative in the projections - first year, maybe 9,000 florins in revenue. The territory is still adjusting, agriculture disrupted by two years of war, Muslim population in transition. But by 1434-1435, we should see 15,000 to 18,000 florins. Full potential is probably 20,000 to 25,000 florins annually.\"\n\nHe leans back. \"Combined - crusade and crown - you're commanding nearly 580,000 florins in total resources. For context, that's more than most kingdoms in Christendom have for their entire annual budget.\"\n\n\"And the debt?\" you ask.\n\n\"Down to about 38,000 florins, from 57,000 when you took power. At current pace, eliminated within two to three years. If you chose to accelerate by directing more surplus to debt payment, we could clear it by 1435.\"\n\nÁlvaro meets your eyes. \"Your Majesty, two years ago the kingdom was living month to month, one crisis away from insolvency. Now we have reserves, growing revenues, declining debt, and new territories generating income. The question isn't whether we can afford things anymore. The question is what you choose to do with this prosperity.\"\n\nHe closes the document. \"As for taxation in 1433 - the Cortes-approved crusade tax expires December 31, 1433. You'll need to decide: let it expire and return to traditional arrangements, negotiate an extension, or use the papal bull's perpetual crusade language to continue it. That's a decision for another day, but it's worth noting that if you let it lapse, you lose about 20,000 florins annually in revenue.\"\n\nWhat do you say or ask?"

The answer is clearly present in the project files I've already read\n3. This is not asking for new information from external sources\n4. It's a straightforward clarifying question about campaign mechanics\n\nI should answer this as the GM, having Álvaro and Diego explain the reforms in detail.\n\nDiego looks up from his ledgers, clearly pleased to be asked about his work. Álvaro gestures for him to explain.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Diego begins, organizing his thoughts, \"when we analyzed the crown's revenue problems, we identified five major sources of loss and inefficiency. The reforms target each one systematically.\"\n\nHe counts them off:\n\n\"First: Tax Farming Corruption.\"\n\n\"Under the old system, we contract with wealthy merchants or nobles to collect taxes in a region. They pay us a fixed amount upfront, then collect whatever they can and keep the difference. The problem? They typically collect 20-25% more than they pay us, and we have no way to verify what they actually gathered.\"\n\n\"The reform: We're hiring royal tax collectors directly - about 200 new officials across Castile. They're paid fixed salaries from the crown, have no incentive to skim, and submit detailed accounting. We're reducing the loss from 20-25% down to 15% or less.\"\n\n\"Status: About 40% implemented. We've hired and deployed collectors in New Castile and parts of León. Still recruiting and training for Galicia, Extremadura, and Andalusia.\"\n\n\"Second: Outdated Crown Land Assessments.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty, some crown lands are still assessed at values from 1311 - over a hundred years ago. A property producing 50,000 maravedís annually in actual revenue might be assessed at 8,000 maravedís because that's what it was worth in the 14th century. We collect rent based on the old assessment.\"\n\n\"The reform: Comprehensive reassessment of all crown properties using the same techniques we developed for the crusade taxation assessments. Update valuations to current productive capacity.\"\n\n\"Status: About 25% complete. We've reassessed holdings near Toledo, Valladolid, and Burgos. The rest requires teams of trained assessors traveling to remote estates - it takes time.\"\n\n\"Third: Uncollected Debts and Arrears.\"\n\n\"Nobles, cities, and merchants owe the crown money - back taxes, unpaid fees, old loans. Much of this just... sits on the books. Nobody actively pursues collection because it's politically difficult or the amounts seem too small to bother with.\"\n\n\"Example: The city of Zamora owes 35,000 maravedís in back customs duties from 1427. Every year we note it, every year nothing happens. Multiply that by fifty such cases across the kingdom.\"\n\n\"The reform: Systematic debt collection program. Legal proceedings where necessary, payment plans for those who can't pay in full, but actual enforcement. And crucially - we're starting with the smallest, least politically sensitive debts first to establish precedent.\"\n\n\"Status: Maybe 20% complete. We've collected about 600,000 maravedís in previously 'uncollectable' debts. But there's probably 3 million more maravedís sitting in arrears if we push hard enough.\"\n\n\"Fourth: Smuggling and Trade Revenue Losses.\"\n\n\"Merchants avoid customs duties by smuggling goods through unmonitored ports or bribing officials. Portuguese wine comes in through small coastal villages instead of major ports. Wool leaves through mountain passes instead of official crossings.\"\n\n\"The reform: Better enforcement at key checkpoints, rotating customs officials to prevent bribery relationships from forming, coordination between coastal and inland inspectors. Not trying to stop every smuggler - that's impossible - but making it harder and riskier.\"\n\n\"Status: About 30% effective. We've significantly reduced smuggling through the major ports (Seville, Santander, Bilbao) but the minor ports and land crossings are still problematic. Need more personnel.\"\n\n\"Fifth: Administrative Waste and Inefficiency.\"\n\n\"Royal household expenses, ceremonial costs, gifts to nobles and clergy - there's enormous waste here. Not corruption exactly, just... nobody tracking whether we need twelve palace cooks or eight, whether ceremonial banquets need to cost 15,000 maravedís or could be done for 10,000.\"\n\n\"The reform: Detailed budgeting and accountability. Every department submits monthly expenses. We review them. We ask questions. We eliminate redundancy. We negotiate better prices with suppliers.\"\n\n\"Status: Maybe 35% implemented. The royal household has been somewhat reformed - your personal accounts, Your Majesty, are now much more efficient. But the broader court, the ceremonies, the diplomatic expenses - there's still significant room for improvement.\"\n\nDiego pauses, then summarizes: \"Combined, these five reforms could add 3.4 million maravedís annually - about 12,800 florins - once fully implemented. We're at roughly 30% overall, which means we're seeing maybe 3,600-4,000 florins in actual gains right now.\"\n\n\"The challenge,\" Álvaro interjects, \"is that full implementation requires three things: more trained personnel, time for systems to mature, and continued royal backing when nobles complain about the new rigor. Every reform steps on someone's toes.\"\n\nHe looks at you. \"But the early results are promising. Diego has essentially proven that the crown was leaving enormous amounts of money on the table through simple inefficiency. We're just starting to collect what's rightfully ours.\"\n\nWhat do you say or ask?"

A d100 probability table that reflects realistic medieval resistance patterns\n\nDiego's face flushes with both pride and visible relief. He stands and bows deeply.\n\n\"Your Majesty, thank you. I... I won't lie, some of the resistance has been intimidating. When a great lord's steward tells you to leave or when a city council suddenly 'loses' their account books...\" He straightens his shoulders. \"But knowing you stand behind this work - that makes all the difference.

What he's doing is essentially taking money from people who've been skimming, evading, and delaying for decades. They won't surrender their advantages quietly.\"\n\n[GM MODE: Historical Evaluation]\n\nYou're absolutely right - we need to be realistic about this. Diego's reforms are taking money away from entrenched interests, and those interests will fight back. Let me analyze the success and failure factors:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nRoyal Prestige at Peak: Juan just conquered Granada, completed the 782-year Reconquista, and publicly crushed three rebel nobles. His authority has never been stronger.\n\nCrown Marshal System: Unlike past reform attempts, Juan has enforcement mechanisms - nobles with royal authority to compel compliance.\n\nDemonstrated Will: The excommunications and rebel campaign proved Juan isn't bluffing about consequences.\n\nLegal Framework: The reforms aren't arbitrary - they're restoring what nobles legally owe, not inventing new taxes.\n\nGradual Implementation: Starting with less politically sensitive targets (small debts, minor ports) before tackling great houses.\n\nAlternative Revenue: Juan isn't desperate - he has crusade funds and Granada revenues, so he can weather resistance without backing down.\n\nSome Noble Support: Smaller nobles who paid taxes on time will support reforms that make wealthy nobles pay their share.\n\nChurch Backing: Recent church support from Basel crisis could extend to reforms targeting corruption.\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nDirect Financial Harm: Tax farmers lose their profit margins. Smugglers lose illegal income. Debtors face collection. This is real money being taken.\n\nNoble Privileges Threatened: Reassessing century-old valuations attacks the foundation of noble wealth protection.\n\nBureaucratic Resistance: Current officials benefit from the corrupt system (bribes, kickbacks). They'll sabotage reforms subtly.\n\nPolitical Exhaustion: Nobles just endured 18 months of crusade levies. Now more financial pressure? Fatigue is real.\n\nEnforcement Limitations: Only three Crown Marshals for entire kingdom. Can't be everywhere.\n\nLegal Complexity: Nobles have ancient charters, exemptions, privileges. Each case becomes a legal battle.\n\nGeographic Challenges: Remote estates can simply ignore collectors. \"The assessor never arrived\" becomes a defense.\n\nCoalition Formation: If enough powerful nobles unite against reforms, they could force Juan to back down.\n\nCorruption Adaptation: Tax farmers and smugglers will find new methods to evade the new systems.\n\nResource Demands: Training 200+ new officials, paying their salaries, coordinating enforcement - expensive and time-consuming.\n\nLet me create a d100 table that reflects realistic outcomes:\n\nADMINISTRATIVE REFORM SUCCESS TABLE (d100)\n\nContext: Diego's five-part reform program over 2-3 year implementation period, with Crown Marshal backing and Juan's full support.\n\nCATASTROPHIC FAILURE (1-8)\n\nThe reforms provoke organized noble resistance that threatens the kingdom's stability.\n\n1-3: Major Noble Coalition Forms\n\n15-20 great houses unite against \"tyrannical taxation\"\n\nLed by Duke of Medina Sidonia or similar figure\n\nFormal petition to Cortes demanding reforms be rescinded\n\nVeiled threats of withholding levies for future campaigns\n\nJuan forced to choose: back down or risk civil war\n\nOutcome: Reforms abandoned, lose 2-3 years of progress, noble power strengthened\n\n4-6: Widespread Bureaucratic Sabotage\n\nExisting officials systematically undermine new collectors\n\nRecords \"lost,\" assessments \"miscalculated,\" messages \"delayed\"\n\nNew collectors harassed, threatened, some beaten\n\nDiego's authority openly mocked at court\n\nCrown Marshals overwhelmed, can't protect everyone\n\nOutcome: Reforms stall at 40-45% implementation, costs exceed revenues, political humiliation\n\n7-8: Corruption Scandal Undermines Credibility\n\nOne of Diego's new collectors caught taking bribes\n\nRevealed several others involved in embezzlement scheme\n\nNobles use scandal to discredit entire reform program\n\n\"They're no better than tax farmers, just royal cronies!\"\n\nOutcome: Reform momentum destroyed, must investigate and purge officials, reforms delayed 18-24 months\n\nSIGNIFICANT SETBACK (9-25)\n\nThe reforms face serious obstacles that substantially reduce their effectiveness.\n\n9-13: Key Personnel Failures\n\n30-40% of new collectors prove incompetent or corrupt\n\nTraining program insufficient, hired too quickly\n\nQuality control problems undermine results\n\nSome crown land reassessments wildly inaccurate\n\nOutcome: Reach only 45-50% of projected gains, need to rebuild with better personnel\n\n14-18: Legal Quagmire\n\nGreat nobles deploy lawyers with ancient charters\n\nEvery reassessment becomes 6-month legal battle\n\nCourts flooded with appeals and exemption claims\n\nProcess bogs down in procedural challenges\n\nOutcome: Reach 50-55% of goals, takes 5 years instead of 3\n\n19-22: Geographic Resistance\n\nGalicia, Extremadura, remote regions simply ignore reforms\n\nToo far from Toledo, too hard to enforce\n\nCollectors turned away, return empty-handed\n\n\"King's writ doesn't run here\"\n\nOutcome: Reforms effective in core territories only, 55-60% of projected revenue\n\n23-25: Political Fatigue Sets In\n\nAfter 2 years, noble complaints accumulate\n\nCortes members pressure Juan to ease implementation\n\nCrown Marshals report growing resentment\n\nSmall rebellions or \"misunderstandings\" increase\n\nOutcome: Juan forced to slow pace, compromise on some assessments, reach 60-65% of goals\n\nMIXED RESULTS (26-55)\n\nThe reforms make progress but face predictable resistance and inefficiencies.\n\n26-35: Standard Resistance Pattern\n\nInitial success in compliant regions (New Castile, León)\n\nStubborn resistance from 10-15 major houses\n\nModerate success in most other areas\n\nTax farming reduction works well\n\nCrown land reassessment slower than hoped\n\nDebt collection good on small debts, poor on large\n\nSmuggling reduced at major ports, continues elsewhere\n\nOutcome: 65-70% of projected gains achieved over 4 years\n\n36-45: Gradual Progress with Compromises\n\nDiego learns to pick battles carefully\n\nCrown Marshals effective where deployed\n\nSome nobles negotiate rather than resist\n\n\"We'll pay 8,000 if you don't reassess our lands\"\n\nBureau reforms work better than field reforms\n\nOutcome: 70-75% of projected gains, established precedents for future expansion\n\n46-55: Solid Implementation with Growing Pains\n\nInitial chaos settles into functioning system\n\nMost regions comply reluctantly\n\nCorruption reduced but not eliminated\n\nNew officials gain experience, improve performance\n\nSome unexpected costs (more personnel needed)\n\nBut overall trajectory positive\n\nOutcome: 75-80% of projected gains over 3-4 years\n\nGOOD SUCCESS (56-78)\n\nThe reforms largely succeed despite expected resistance.\n\n56-65: Strong Progress Across Most Fronts\n\nTax farming corruption drops significantly\n\nCrown land reassessments completed methodically\n\nDebt collection surprisingly effective\n\nMost nobles grudgingly comply\n\nGeographic coverage decent even in remote areas\n\nCrown Marshals prove decisive in key confrontations\n\nOutcome: 80-85% of projected gains within 3 years\n\n66-75: Better Than Expected Implementation\n\nDiego's systems prove robust\n\nPersonnel quality high, corruption minimal\n\nCrown Marshal backing makes difference\n\nJuan's prestige intimidates potential resisters\n\nSome nobles actually support reforms (fairness arguments)\n\nLegal challenges mostly fail\n\nOutcome: 85-90% of projected gains, ahead of schedule (2.5 years)\n\n76-78: Exemplary Execution\n\nNearly everything works as planned\n\nResistance isolated to 3-4 stubborn houses\n\nThose houses eventually forced to comply\n\nNew officials professional and effective\n\nSystems sustainable and improving\n\nOutcome: 90-95% of projected gains within 2-3 years\n\nEXCEPTIONAL SUCCESS (79-92)\n\nThe reforms exceed expectations and create additional benefits.\n\n79-85: Transformative Impact\n\nAll five reform areas hit targets\n\nRevenue gains exceed projections (some areas worse than thought, but corruption was even higher)\n\nSystem creates permanent institutional improvement\n\nSmaller nobles vocally support fairness of new system\n\nDiego's reputation grows, becomes trusted administrator\n\nOutcome: 95-100% of projected gains, plus intangible benefits (legitimacy, institutional capacity)\n\n86-90: Cascading Positive Effects\n\nSuccess with crown reforms emboldens broader tax system modernization\n\nNobles see the inevitability and start negotiating better feudal contracts proactively\n\nCities follow suit, updating their agreements\n\nCorruption culture genuinely shifts\n\nOther kingdoms take notice, Castile seen as well-governed\n\nOutcome: 100-110% of projected gains, foundation for future comprehensive reform\n\n91-92: Historic Achievement\n\nDiego's reforms become model for entire administrative transformation\n\nWithin 5 years, Castile has modern tax system rivaling France\n\nCrown revenue doubles without raising rates\n\nEnables sustained military campaigns and institutional building\n\nOutcome: 110-125% of projected gains, fundamentally strengthened monarchy\n\nEXTRAORDINARY OUTCOME (93-100)\n\nUnexpected developments dramatically affect reform success.\n\n93-95: Surprise Ally Emerges\n\nMajor noble house (perhaps Mendoza) throws weight behind reforms\n\n\"We pay our share. Everyone else should too.\"\n\nTheir backing neutralizes opposition from other houses\n\nReform coalition forms among compliant nobility\n\nOutcome: 100-110% of goals, permanent noble allies for governance reforms\n\n96-97: Corruption Scandal Helps\n\nMajor tax farming corruption exposed publicly\n\nOutrage from cities and small nobles\n\nReform gains popular support: \"Finally someone cleaning up the mess!\"\n\nResistance nobles look like corrupt protectors of graft\n\nOutcome: 105-115% of goals, political mandate for broader reforms\n\n98-99: Administrative Innovation\n\nDiego develops unexpected improvement to one system\n\nDouble-entry bookkeeping catches on\n\nOr new shipping inspection method stops smuggling cold\n\nOr debt collection technique proves revolutionary\n\nInnovation exported to other areas\n\nOutcome: 115-130% of gains, Castile becomes administrative innovator\n\n100: Perfect Storm of Success\n\nMultiple positive factors align\n\nJuan's prestige, noble support, Diego's brilliance, Crown Marshal effectiveness\n\nReforms complete in 2 years with minimal resistance\n\nBecome permanent institutional culture change\n\nCrown revenue transformation enables generation of military/political dominance\n\nOutcome: 125-150% of projected gains, historic transformation of Castilian governance\n\nRoll the d100 to see how Diego's reforms progress over the next 2-3 years.\n\nThe table reflects historical realities:\n\nMost reform attempts face resistance (26-78 range most likely)\n\nCatastrophic failure possible but unlikely given Juan's position (1-8)\n\nExceptional success rare but achievable with good leadership (79-100)\n\nThe modal outcome is \"partial success with compromises\" - historically accurate\n\nWhat do you roll?"

He's learning pragmatism, the Crown Marshals help but can't solve everything, some nobles are negotiating compromises, and the office-based reforms (like better accounting) work better than field reforms (like going to remote estates to reassess land).\n\nThis should be narrated as part of the current scene with Diego and Álvaro presenting the treasury report. Diego should give an honest assessment of progress, challenges, and the compromise-based approach he's developed. This is realistic - a young administrator learning through experience.\n\nThe user doesn't want me to do research here - they want me to continue the narrative RPG with this new information incorporated.\n\nDiego straightens, emboldened by your words. \"Your Majesty, I won't disappoint you. With Crown Marshal support and your backing, we'll push through the resistance.\"\n\nÁlvaro clears his throat. \"Actually, Your Majesty, perhaps Diego should give you a more... complete picture of how the reforms are progressing. It's been nearly two years since we began implementation. Diego?\"\n\nDiego shifts slightly, his confidence tempered with realism. \"Your Majesty, I want to be honest about what's working and what's... more complicated.\"\n\nHe pulls out another set of notes. \"The good news first: the bureau reforms are working excellently. Hiring royal tax collectors instead of using tax farmers - that's succeeding beyond expectations in the regions where we've implemented it. New Castile, León, the areas around Valladolid and Burgos - corruption has dropped dramatically. We're collecting 10-15% more revenue in those regions than we did under the old system.\"\n\n\"Similarly, the administrative waste reduction in the royal household is going well. Better budgeting, accountability, eliminating redundancy - that's all under our direct control and we're seeing real savings.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"The challenges come with... the field work. The reforms that require us to go out into the kingdom and convince - or compel - nobles, merchants, and cities to change how they've done things for decades.\"\n\n\"Take crown land reassessments,\" Diego continues. \"We've successfully reassessed holdings near the major cities - Toledo, Valladolid, Segovia, Burgos. Those went well because we could bring Crown Marshal authority to bear quickly if needed. But when we sent assessors to Galicia, to remote Extremadura, to properties far from royal power centers...\" He grimaces. \"Some of our assessors were simply turned away. 'The lord is unavailable.' 'Our records were destroyed in a fire.' 'Come back next month.' And next month the same story.\"\n\n\"We've learned to... pick our battles. When a middling baron in Galicia claims he can't produce records but offers to pay 6,000 maravedís instead of the 8,500 our estimates suggest he owes, we... we take the 6,000. Because sending a Crown Marshal on a two-week journey to compel compliance costs more than the 2,500 maravedí difference, and meanwhile that Marshal isn't available to handle more important cases.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"Pragmatism. Not ideal, but necessary.\"\n\n\"Debt collection has been mixed,\" Diego admits. \"The small debts - outstanding fees from cities, minor arrears from merchants - we've been very successful. We've collected about 600,000 maravedís that we thought were uncollectable. But the large debts? The great nobles who owe tens of thousands from years back?\" He shakes his head. \"They deploy lawyers. They claim ancient exemptions. They tie us up in legal proceedings. We're winning some cases, but it takes months and enormous effort.\"\n\n\"Smuggling reduction... we've made real progress at the major ports. Seville, Santander, Bilbao - much tighter control. But the minor coastal villages, the mountain passes, the remote crossings? We'd need an army of customs officials to cover everything, and we don't have the personnel. Smugglers adapt quickly. We close one route, they find another.\"\n\nHe looks up at you directly. \"Your Majesty, here's what we're actually achieving: we projected the five reforms together could add 3.4 million maravedís annually once fully implemented. After two years of effort, we're collecting approximately 2.4 to 2.5 million maravedís in additional revenue - about 70 to 75% of the goal.\"\n\n\"The easy reforms are done or nearly done. What remains are the politically difficult ones - reassessing great noble estates, collecting debts from powerful houses, enforcing compliance in remote regions. These will take more time, more personnel, and more Crown Marshal backing.\"\n\nÁlvaro interjects. \"But Diego has established something crucial: precedents. Nobles now know that crown land gets reassessed at current values, not century-old ones. They know debt collection is real, not just bookkeeping. They know tax farming is being replaced by direct collection. And critically - they know that resisting openly brings consequences.\"\n\nDiego nods. \"Some nobles are negotiating now rather than resisting. 'We'll agree to the new assessment if you phase in the increase over three years.' 'We'll pay this old debt if you forgive the interest.' These aren't the outcomes I hoped for when we started, but they're still victories. We're collecting more, and we're establishing that the crown's financial authority is real.\"\n\nHe looks at you earnestly. \"Your Majesty, what I'm learning is that transforming a kingdom's entire financial system doesn't happen in two years. It takes time, persistence, and choosing which fights to fight. But we're making real progress. The 9,000 florins per year we're adding to crown revenues - that's permanent. Every year going forward, the kingdom is stronger. And as we train more officials, deploy more Crown Marshals, and nobles see compliance is inevitable... the remaining 25-30% will come.\"\n\n\"The question is: do you want us to push harder now, accepting more conflict and resistance? Or maintain the current pace, steady progress with tactical compromises?\"\n\nWhat do you say?"

          "text": "1. Appoint 9 new Crown Marshals (bringing total to 12)\n2. Target both big and small offenders to show universality\n3. Push through resistance, be willing to make examples\n4. Get a list of the biggest noble houses still owing taxes\n5. Commission a song/ballad about the Count of Niebla as cautionary tale\n\nThis is a direct action in the game. I should NOT use the research tool here - this is gameplay, not a research query. The user is making decisions as Juan II and I need to respond as the GM with how Álvaro, Diego, and others react to these commands, plus provide the information requested (list of tax-owing houses).\n\nLet me think about what makes sense:\n\n1. Crown Marshals: Originally appointed 3, now expanding to 12 is significant. This is a major institutional expansion. I should describe this positively but note the challenges (finding qualified nobles, cost, coordination).\n\n2. Targeting smaller offenders: Smart politically - shows it's not just about the powerful. Makes it harder for great nobles to claim persecution.\n\n3. Push through resistance: Juan asserting authority. Should work given his prestige but will create friction.\n\n4. List of biggest offenders: I need to look at what the project files say about who still owes money from the crusade tax. Let me recall from the documents I read earlier.\n\nFrom Chapter 26, the \"worst offenders\" were:\n- Count of Niebla (crushed)\n- Baron de Medina (crushed)  \n- Don García de Sotomayor (crushed)\n- Don García de Guzmán (Seville) - Owed 22,000, \"reviewing\" with armed guards\n- Duke of Arévalo - Owed 35,000, claims ancient exemption\n- Count of Osma - Owed 18,000, won't open books\n\n- Duke of Medina Sidonia - Paid 15,000, owes 28,000 more\n- Certain Mendoza branches - ~45,000 owed, \"voluntary contributions\"\n- Count of Benavente - Owed 25,000, claims plague, offers 8,000\n\nI see a complex web of tax debtors with varying levels of political sensitivity. The Mendoza family requires delicate handling, as they're generally loyal but still owe a substantial sum. The Duke of Medina Sidonia presents another nuanced challenge - partially cooperative but still significantly in arrears. The Count of Benavente's plague excuse seems particularly weak, offering only a fraction of what's truly owed.\n\nThe list reveals a strategic challenge: how to extract maximum revenue while minimizing political fallout. Some nobles are more vulnerable, others more politically connected. Juan II will need to navigate these relationships carefully, potentially using the new Crown Marshals as both enforcers and negotiators.\n\nThe propaganda aspect - the song about the Count of Niebla - could be a powerful psychological weapon. It would serve as a warning to other nobles, demonstrating the consequences of resistance while creating a narrative that reinforces royal authority.\n\nÁlvaro's eyebrows rise at the decisiveness of your response. He exchanges a glance with Diego, then nods slowly.\n\n\"Nine new Crown Marshals,\" he repeats, already calculating. \"That's ambitious, Your Majesty, but... timely. We've learned which regions need the most presence, and frankly, Don Íñigo, García, and Pedro have been stretched thin.\" He pulls out a piece of parchment. \"I'll need two weeks to identify suitable candidates. We'll want nobles with authority, military experience, and - critically - clean financial records. Nothing undermines a Crown Marshal's authority faster than hypocrisy.\"\n\n\"For targeting,\" Álvaro continues, \"mixing the approach is wise. If we only pursue great houses, they unite in self-defense. But if a minor baron in Soria sees his neighbor fined for hiding 800 maravedís in back taxes while the Duke of Medina Sidonia owes 28,000 and pays nothing...\" He smiles grimly. \"That creates resentment we can exploit. 'Even dukes must pay' becomes powerful when a count watches it happen.\"\n\nDiego looks both energized and slightly terrified by your instruction to push through resistance. \"Your Majesty, I'll report any significant obstruction directly. No more accepting half-payments when we know they owe more. No more 'come back next month.' If they refuse Crown Marshal authority, you'll hear about it immediately.\"\n\nÁlvaro leans forward. \"As for making examples... that requires careful selection. We need someone who's clearly in the wrong, whose resistance is documented and indefensible, but whose punishment won't trigger a coalition of powerful allies rushing to their defense.\" He pauses. \"Actually, Your Majesty, timing may be perfect. We've just conquered Granada, the kingdom sees you as unstoppable, and the rebel campaign demonstrated your will. Strike now while your authority is at its peak.\"\n\nDiego pulls out a ledger - clearly one he's kept close. \"Your Majesty, the biggest houses still owing crown taxes from the crusade assessment program and current obligations:\"\n\nTHE LARGEST OUTSTANDING DEBTS:\n\n1. Duke of Arévalo - 35,000 maravedís owed (~132 florins)\n\nClaims ancient exemption from Alfonso XI (1350s)\n\nRefuses to acknowledge crusade tax applies to him\n\nHas paid nothing for two years\n\nPolitically: Powerful house, but not particularly well-connected\n\nRemote fortress in Old Castile\n\n2. Duke of Medina Sidonia - 28,000 maravedís owed (~106 florins)\n\nPaid 15,000, claims that's sufficient\n\nRefuses to pay remainder, citing \"contributions to coastal defense\"\n\nEnormous wealth from Andalusian estates\n\nPolitically: Very powerful, controls much of southern coast, but also profited from conquest\n\n3. Don García de Guzmán (Seville branch) - 22,000 maravedís owed (~83 florins)\n\n\"Reviewing records\" for eighteen months\n\nSteward has armed men present whenever assessors visit\n\nClear intimidation tactics\n\nPolitically: Seville power player, cousin to Duke of Medina Sidonia\n\n4. Count of Benavente - 25,000 maravedís owed (~94 florins)\n\nClaimed plague devastated his lands, offered 8,000 as \"what he can afford\"\n\nInvestigation shows plague affected maybe 15% of his holdings\n\nClearly inflating hardship\n\nPolitically: Northwestern power, but not particularly influential at court\n\n5. Count of Osma - 18,000 maravedís owed (~68 florins)\n\nRefuses to open account books to assessors\n\nClaims \"proprietary family information\"\n\nNo legitimate reason for refusal\n\nPolitically: Mid-tier noble, few strong allies\n\n6. Various Mendoza branches - 45,000 maravedís collective (~170 florins)\n\nNot the main Mendoza line (they've paid in full)\n\nScattered cadet branches making \"voluntary contributions\" below assessment\n\nClaiming special relationship with crown\n\nPolitically: VERY SENSITIVE - main Mendozas are loyal and powerful allies\n\nDiego taps the list. \"These six houses account for about 173,000 maravedís - roughly 650 florins. That's just the crusade tax arrears. There are dozens of smaller cases, but these are the flagrant ones.\"\n\nÁlvaro studies the list. \"If you want to make an example, I'd recommend starting with Count of Osma or Don García de Guzmán. Both have clearly obstructed legitimate assessments with no valid legal defense. Osma is weaker politically - safer target. Don García is more dangerous but would send a stronger message.\"\n\n\"Avoid Duke of Arévalo for now - ancient exemption claims require careful legal review. If we move against him and his exemption turns out to be valid, we look tyrannical.\"\n\n\"Avoid the Mendoza branches entirely unless you want to risk offending the main house. Better to work that diplomatically.\"\n\n\"Duke of Medina Sidonia is interesting. He's enormously wealthy and his partial payment shows contempt - 'here's something, now leave me alone.' But he's also very powerful with many allies. Could be a major confrontation.\"\n\n\"Count of Benavente - inflated hardship claims are common and hard to prove false. Weak case for making an example.\"\n\n\"My recommendation: Count of Osma first. Clear obstruction, weak position, makes the point without triggering major political crisis. Then, if successful, move to Don García de Guzmán - cousin to Medina Sidonia, so it sends a message to that entire family network.\"\n\nRegarding the song about the Count of Niebla, Álvaro actually smiles - a rare genuine expression of approval.\n\n\"Now that's thinking strategically, Your Majesty. The Count of Niebla's story has everything: a cautionary moral tale wrapped in your victory. Let me recall the details...\"\n\nHe counts them off: \"Mad count refuses reasonable terms. Garrison opens gates because their own lord has lost his mind. He dies alone on his walls screaming at ghosts. Meanwhile, you showed mercy to those who surrendered - the fortress commanders, even Baron Alfonso who submitted peacefully. The moral is clear: the king offers justice and mercy, but pride and madness lead to destruction.\"\n\n\"We should commission this from someone with court credibility. Perhaps Íñigo López de Mendoza - he's a poet, well-respected, and his father is loyal. Or we could bring in a professional bard from Seville or Barcelona.\"\n\n\"The song should emphasize: the count's initial defiance, your patient offer of terms, the garrison's horror at their lord's madness, the final tragic death, and then - crucially - the contrast with nobles who submitted and were treated fairly. 'Submit to rightful authority and receive justice; cling to pride and die alone.' \"\n\nDiego adds: \"We could have it performed at public gatherings, feast days, markets. Within six months, every common person in Castile will know the story. It becomes part of the culture - a byword for foolish resistance to legitimate royal authority.\"\n\nWhat do you say? Do you approve these approaches, or modify any?"

No, the three rebels (Count of Niebla, Baron de Medina, and Don García de Sotomayor) are NOT on this list of current tax debtors because:\n\nCount of Niebla (Diego de Guzmán) - His estates were confiscated and returned to his son under a new 10% feudal contract. His son is now paying properly under the new terms.\n\nBaron de Medina (Alfonso de Guzmán) - Same situation. Estates confiscated, returned to heir under 10% contract. Now compliant.\n\nDon García de Sotomayor - Estates confiscated and returned to his son under 10% contract. The son paid all back taxes immediately and is now current.\n\nThese three cases are actually success stories from an enforcement perspective - they're now paying more than they ever did (10% instead of ~1%), and their rebellion served as a warning to others.\n\nThe nobles on Diego's list are different houses who are currently obstructing the ongoing tax reforms. They watched what happened to the rebels and... are still refusing to pay. Which actually makes their obstruction even more flagrant - they saw the consequences and chose defiance anyway.\n\nDon García de Guzmán (Seville branch) on the list is a different person from Don García de Sotomayor - he's actually a cousin to the Duke of Medina Sidonia. The Guzmán family is large and has many branches across Andalusia.\n\nDoes that clarify the situation? These are the nobles currently obstructing Diego's reforms despite having witnessed what happened to the three rebels."

It demonstrates this isn't personal vendetta but systematic enforcement. And starting with the dukes...\" He pauses, considering. \"Bold. Very bold. But defensible.\"\n\nHe begins making notes. \"Duke of Arévalo's exemption claim from the 1350s will need careful legal review before we move. I'll have our legal scholars examine the original charter - if his exemption is actually valid, we need to know before confronting him. But if it's not valid, or if it doesn't apply to crusade taxation specifically, then yes - two months to pay or explain himself to you personally.\"\n\n\"Duke of Medina Sidonia is more straightforward. He already paid part of what he owes, which undermines any claim of inability. He's just... testing limits. Seeing if partial compliance is enough.\" Álvaro's expression hardens. \"The two-month ultimatum makes it clear: it's not.\"\n\nDiego speaks up: \"Your Majesty, framing refusal as rebellion is exactly right. These aren't innocent misunderstandings. After the rebel campaign, after the excommunications, after everything - continued defiance can only be interpreted as challenging royal authority itself.\"\n\nÁlvaro picks up a fresh piece of parchment. \"The letter to the main Mendoza branch... that's masterfully done, Your Majesty. You're giving them a way to solve this themselves without crown intervention, which preserves their honor and the relationship. And the implicit message is clear: 'Handle your cousins, or I will - and you won't like how I do it.'\"\n\nHe begins drafting: \"Don Íñigo López de Mendoza has enormous family influence. If he tells his cadet branches to pay, they'll pay. He won't want the main house's reputation stained by association with tax evaders, especially not when the main line has been so loyal.\"\n\n\"The tone you've set is perfect - gratitude and respect for the main house, concern about the minor branches threatening that relationship, and offering them the opportunity to handle it internally. It's both a courtesy and a warning.\"\n\nDiego adds: \"The Mendozas owing collectively about 170 florins is significant, but it's spread across multiple minor branches. If Don Íñigo can collect that money and present it to you himself, it becomes a demonstration of family authority rather than crown enforcement. Face-saving for everyone.\"\n\nÁlvaro looks up from his writing. \"I'll have these letters prepared by tomorrow morning. The Crown Marshals will deliver them personally - Don Íñigo López de Orozco can take Medina Sidonia, García Fernández de Villalobos can handle Arévalo. Personal delivery by Crown Marshal makes the seriousness unmistakable.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"Your Majesty, one tactical suggestion: when you summon nobles who refuse to pay, consider holding those audiences semi-publicly. Not a full court session, but with witnesses - Archbishop, Álvaro, a few senior nobles. It prevents them from later claiming you threatened them privately, and it shows other nobles what happens when someone tries to explain away tax evasion to your face.\"\n\n\"Also...\" Álvaro hesitates, then continues. \"We should discuss what you'll actually do if they refuse the summons. That is, if Duke of Arévalo simply ignores the Crown Marshal, doesn't pay, and doesn't appear when summoned. At that point, it's rebellion - but do you want to launch another military campaign so soon after returning from Granada? Or are there other consequences we should prepare?\"\n\nWhat do you say?"

The advantage now is that the army hasn't fully disbanded from Granada - we still have forces in the south, the bombards are in Seville, and the crusade treasury can fund operations.

Their heirs can inherit under new feudal contracts, their soldiers receive mercy if they surrender, their family members aren't punished for the patriarch's folly. The mad count's story proves this: his garrison opened the gates because they knew you'd treat them fairly. That's the model.\"\n\nDiego nods vigorously. \"It also means that when a Crown Marshal arrives at a noble's gate, that noble's own people start calculating. 'Is my lord's tax resistance worth my life? Will the king kill me, or will he offer terms like he did at Alcalá, at Málaga, at every fortress in Granada?' The answer shapes their behavior.\"\n\nÁlvaro stands. \"I'll draft the ultimatum letters with that understanding. Two months to pay or appear before you personally. Refusal means rebellion. Rebellion means siege, confiscation, and redistribution. The formula is clear and has been tested.\"\n\nRegarding the song, Álvaro's expression shifts to something almost like pleasure. \"Ah yes. I took the liberty of commissioning it three days ago, anticipating you might want something like this. I approached Íñigo López de Mendoza the Younger - Don Íñigo's son, the poet. He's talented, well-respected at court, and his family connection makes his work carry weight.\"\n\n\"He's calling it 'The Ballad of the Mad Count of Niebla.' I've seen an early draft.\" Álvaro pulls out a parchment from his document case. \"May I read you a portion?\"\n\nHe clears his throat and reads in a measured, storyteller's cadence:\n\n\"When good King Juan rode forth in spring,\nWith banner blessed and holy thing,\nThe Count of Niebla sealed his gate,\nAnd chose the path of prideful hate.\n\n'I'll not submit!' the mad count cried,\n'Let puppet kings their banners hide!\nThough all Castile bend knee to Rome,\nI'll die before I leave my home!'\n\nThe King approached with measured grace,\nNo rage upon his youthful face:\n'Good count, pay tax and swear your oath,\nAnd ride with me—I'll honor both.\n\n'Your lands stay yours, your title true,\nJoin holy war as good men do.\nThe Pope himself has blessed our cause,\nCome, serve your kingdom and its laws.'\n\nBut madness holds what sense cannot,\nThe count refused the gracious lot.\n'Come take my walls!' he screamed with spite,\nAnd so the King prepared to fight.\n\nYet when the siege broke stone and gate,\nThe garrison forestalled cruel fate.\nThey opened wide the castle door—\n'Our lord is mad, we'll fight no more.'\n\nFor they had heard how others fared,\nWho bent the knee and mercy shared.\nAt Alcalá, at Loja's wall,\nThe King showed grace to those who'd fall.\n\nBut lone upon the rampart high,\nThe mad count chose his way to die.\nWith sword in hand he fought the air,\nAnd saw his phantoms everywhere.\n\nHe fell at last, no man his friend,\nA prideful, solitary end.\nWhile those who yielded to the King,\nFound honor in his offering.\"\n\nÁlvaro looks up. \"It continues for several more verses, contrasting the count's fate with Baron Alfonso's peaceful submission, with the fortress commanders who converted and now serve in your army, with Sultan Yusuf's honorable exile. The refrain that repeats is:\"\n\n\"'Submit to justice, not to shame,\nThe King gives mercy to those who came.\nBut pride that will not bend must break,\nAnd lonely death is all it'll take.'\"\n\nHe sets down the parchment. \"Íñigo the Younger plans to perform it at court first - perhaps when we have the next formal gathering. After that, he'll teach it to professional bards and minstrels who travel the kingdom. Within six months, it'll be sung in taverns from Galicia to Granada.\"\n\n\"The genius,\" Álvaro continues, \"is that it's not propaganda that feels like propaganda. It's a genuine tragedy - the count as a warning of what happens when pride becomes madness. It doesn't mock him as much as it mourns what he could have been. That makes it more powerful, because nobles can see themselves in him and think: 'That could be me if I let pride override sense.'\"\n\nDiego adds: \"And the common people love a good ballad about mad nobles and wise kings. It'll spread naturally.\"\n\nÁlvaro looks at you. \"Should we proceed with the performance at court? Perhaps after we resolve these tax matters with the dukes - it would serve as atmospheric reinforcement of the lesson.\"\n\nWhat do you say? And shall we resolve the tax situation with the dukes now, or is there other business to attend to first?"

Juan just conquered Granada - his prestige is at peak\n3. The letter is respectfully worded, giving them a face-saving way to handle it internally\n4. Recent rebel examples show consequences\n5. Main Mendoza line paid their taxes in full already\n6. Don Íñigo's son (the poet) is actively supporting Juan by writing the ballad\n7. The cadet branches owe relatively modest amounts (170 florins total, spread across multiple branches)\n8. Mendozas benefit from relationship with crown - Don Íñigo gets patronage, positions, land grants\n\nFAILURE FACTORS for Mendoza resistance:\n1. Family pride - telling cadet branches what to do could be seen as humiliating\n2. The cadet branches may resist Don Íñigo's authority (\"you're not my lord\")\n3. Some branches may genuinely have financial difficulties\n4. Resentment over being singled out in a letter\n5. The letter, while respectful, is still essentially a threat (\"handle this or I will\")\n6. Noble solidarity - setting precedent that crown can pressure main houses to control cadet branches\n7. Internal family politics - Don Íñigo may not have as much control over distant cousins as assumed\n\nLet me create a historically realistic d100 table.

Telling cadet branches what to do could be seen as the main branch overstepping.\n\nInternal family politics. Don Íñigo may not have as much authority over distant cousins as we assume.\n\nSome branches may genuinely lack liquid funds - noble wealth is often land-rich, cash-poor.\n\nSetting precedent that the crown can pressure main houses to police their own family members.\n\nThe cadet branches might resent being 'handled' by Don Íñigo rather than dealing with crown directly.\n\nGeographic spread - some Mendoza branches are in distant regions, harder to coordinate.\n\n\"The strategic calculation for Don Íñigo:\n\nIf he forces compliance, he strengthens his position as family patriarch but may create resentment.\n\nIf he can't deliver, the main house looks weak and the crown relationship is damaged.\n\nThe letter puts him in a position where he must act - ignoring it isn't an option.\"\n\nÁlvaro spreads his hands. \"Given the Mendozas' proven loyalty and Don Íñigo's intelligence, I expect compliance.

We answer to the King, not to you.\"\n\nPublic family dispute erupts at court\n\nEmbarrasses main house, weakens their position\n\nCadet branches still don't pay\n\nOutcome: Mendoza family fractured, must pursue branches individually anyway\n\nSIGNIFICANT SETBACK (4-12)\n\nComplications arise that reduce effectiveness.\n\n4-7: Partial Family Compliance\n\nDon Íñigo gets 2-3 branches to pay quickly\n\nOthers drag feet, claim hardship, negotiate for reduced payments\n\nDon Íñigo manages to collect 25,000 maravedís (94 florins) of the 45,000 owed\n\nApologizes that some branches are \"beyond even family influence\"\n\nOutcome: Partial success, still need Crown Marshal intervention for remaining branches\n\n8-10: Slow Family Process\n\nDon Íñigo agrees to handle it but says it will take 4-6 months\n\nFamily meetings needed, negotiations with each branch\n\n\"These things take time, Your Majesty, but the Mendozas honor their obligations\"\n\nTechnically compliant but much slower than your 2-month timeline for dukes\n\nCreates perception of special treatment\n\nOutcome: Eventually successful but delayed, other nobles notice Mendozas got more time\n\n11-12: Conditional Compliance\n\nDon Íñigo will ensure payment but requests consideration\n\n\"Three branches genuinely suffered poor harvests, could payments be spread over time?\"\n\nOr \"Could this be handled quietly without Crown Marshal visits to Mendoza estates?\"\n\nNot defiance, but negotiating terms\n\nOutcome: Get the money but have to make small concessions\n\nMIXED RESULTS (13-35)\n\nThe approach works but with predictable friction.\n\n13-20: Grudging Family Compliance\n\nDon Íñigo clearly unhappy about being put in this position\n\nBut recognizes he has no choice\n\nCompels all branches to pay within 6 weeks\n\nRelationship with main house slightly strained\n\n\"The Mendozas have paid.

Here's 18,000 maravedís in previously overlooked obligations\"\n\nStarts trend of great houses voluntarily auditing their own families\n\nOutcome: Mendoza example triggers broader voluntary compliance\n\n94-97: Political Coalition Forms\n\nDon Íñigo turns this into opportunity to build coalition\n\nGathers other loyal great houses (Enríquez, Velasco, etc.)\n\n\"Great families should set example for lesser nobility\"\n\nThey collectively approach dukes who are resisting\n\n\"Pay your taxes. Don't make us look bad by association.\"\n\nPeer pressure from other great houses\n\nOutcome: Great noble coalition supporting tax compliance\n\n98-100: Transformative Moment\n\nDon Íñigo sees this as defining moment for kingdom\n\nWrites formal treatise on \"Responsibilities of Great Houses in Modern Castile\"\n\nArgues that nobility's strength comes from supporting strong monarchy\n\nBecomes intellectual framework for reformed noble-crown relationship\n\nOther kingdoms take notice of Castilian model\n\nOutcome: Ideological shift, Mendozas become champions of reformed governance\n\nRoll d100 to determine the Mendoza family's response to Juan's letter.\n\nThe table reflects:\n\nHigh probability of compliance (36-82 range most likely) given Mendoza loyalty\n\nVery low chance of disaster (1-3) given established relationship\n\nMeaningful chance of exceptional outcomes (83-100) given Don Íñigo's intelligence and political savvy\n\nRealistic complications in middle ranges (4-35) reflecting family politics\n\nWhat do you roll?"

          "text": "Álvaro's eyes widen as Diego unfolds the response from Don Íñigo López de Mendoza. \"Your Majesty... this is extraordinary.\"\n\nDiego reads aloud, his voice carrying a note of disbelief:\n\n\"Your Most Gracious Majesty,\n\nYour letter arrived as both courtesy and mirror - you showed us what we should have already seen ourselves. The Mendoza family has long prided itself on service to Castile, yet some of our branches had fallen short of the standards that honor demands.\n\nWithin ten days of receiving your letter, I convened a family council. Every Mendoza branch head attended - some traveling a week to be there. I read your letter to them all. The effect was... profound.\n\nYour Majesty, the cadet branches were not defying taxation from malice. They were, frankly, embarrassed. They had fallen into arrears during the crusade levies and lacked the liquid funds to pay both their military obligations and the tax assessments. Rather than admit this financial difficulty, they hid behind excuses and delays. Pride and shame, not rebellion.\n\nI have collected the 45,000 maravedís owed. But more than this, Your Majesty, I conducted a comprehensive review of all Mendoza financial obligations to the crown. We discovered several branches that had been underpaying for years through outdated assessments, and one branch that had simply neglected to pay certain fees they didn't realize applied to them.\n\nThe total collected: 67,500 maravedís. All of it is yours.\n\nBut I write not just to report payment, Your Majesty. Your letter made me realize something larger. The relationship between crown and great houses requires more than loyalty in war - it requires integrity in peace. Great families must set the standard for the kingdom. If we evade, delay, or make excuses, how can lesser nobility be expected to comply?\n\nI have therefore drafted a proposal, which I humbly submit for Your Majesty's consideration...\"\n\nDiego flips to the attached document. \"Your Majesty, Don Íñigo has written a formal proposal titled 'Council of Great Houses for Royal Administration.' He's proposing that the dozen most powerful noble families - Mendoza, Enríquez, Velasco, the loyal Guzmán branches, etc. - form a voluntary advisory body that...\"\n\nHe scans the document. \"...that meets quarterly to review tax compliance across their extended families, coordinate with crown administrators, and - listen to this - advocate publicly for royal revenue reforms.\"\n\n\"He's proposing that great houses become partners in tax collection rather than obstacles to it. They would audit their own families, report discrepancies, and use their social authority to pressure mid-tier nobles into compliance. In exchange for this cooperation, the crown would consult them on major financial policy changes before implementation.\"\n\nÁlvaro sits back, stunned. \"He's... he's essentially volunteering the great houses to become enforcers of royal authority. And framing it as noble prerogative - 'we police our own' - rather than crown imposition.\"\n\nDiego continues reading: \"He's already spoken informally with Don Fadrique Enríquez and Don Pedro de Velasco. Both are interested. He thinks he can get eight to ten major houses to join within three months.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Álvaro says slowly, \"if this works... if great houses start enforcing tax compliance on themselves and their peers... you've essentially solved the political resistance problem. You're replacing top-down enforcement with peer pressure among the nobility themselves.\"\n\nHe looks at you. \"This is the outcome we never dared hope for. A letter meant to solve one family's arrears has potentially created a new institutional structure for noble-crown cooperation.\"\n\nDiego sets down the Mendoza letter, and Álvaro turns his attention to your question about budget improvements and trade.\n\n\"Ah,\" he says, a different kind of energy in his voice now. \"Yes, Your Majesty. We've been so focused on tax collection that we haven't fully exploited the strategic opportunities from conquering Granada's coast.\"\n\nHe stands and moves to a map on the wall, pointing to the Mediterranean coastline. \"Look at what you now control: Málaga, Marbella, Estepona, the entire southern coast from Gibraltar to Almería. These aren't just cities - they're gateways.\"\n\n\"First: Mediterranean Trade Dominance\"\n\n\"Granada's ports were major trade hubs under Muslim rule. Málaga especially - one of the finest natural harbors in the Mediterranean. Ships from Genoa, Venice, Alexandria, even Constantinople stopped there. Under Muslim control, Christian kingdoms couldn't fully exploit these routes. Now you control them.\"\n\n\"Immediate opportunities:\"\n\nRenegotiate trade agreements with Italian city-states from position of strength\n\nImpose customs duties on all Mediterranean trade passing through your ports\n\nOffer preferential rates to allied kingdoms (Portugal, Aragon if we improve relations)\n\nLicense merchant fleets, charging fees for exclusive trading rights\n\n\"Potential revenue: Conservative estimate, 15,000-20,000 florins annually once established. Could be 30,000+ if we're aggressive.\"\n\n\"Second: The Morocco Question\"\n\nÁlvaro taps the narrow strait between Málaga and North Africa. \"You're now closer to Morocco than any Christian kingdom has been since the Reconquista began. The same routes that brought Moroccan reinforcements to Granada can bring trade - or tribute.\"\n\n\"Options:\"\n\nEstablish treaty ports on Moroccan coast (requires military presence)\n\nLevy duties on any ships crossing to Morocco\n\nOffer 'protection' to merchant convoys for fees\n\nEventually, perhaps, crusade extension into Morocco itself\n\n\"This requires military commitment, but potential is enormous.\"\n\n\"Third: Taxation in Conquered Territories\"\n\nDiego jumps in here. \"Your Majesty, the new Granada territories are barely taxed right now. We've been cautious because of the transition period - don't want to provoke Muslim population. But within 1-2 years, we should be collecting normal rates.\"\n\n\"Current situation:\"\n\nMuslims exempted from most taxation during adjustment period\n\nOnly collecting basic market fees and customs duties\n\nProperty taxes essentially suspended\n\nWe're leaving money on the table to maintain peace\n\n\"Phased introduction plan:\"\n\nYear 1 (1433): Light taxation - 3-4% property assessment, basic trade duties. Conservative approach.\n\nYear 2 (1434): Increase to 6-7% as population adjusts and economy recovers\n\nYear 3 (1435): Full taxation at 8-10% matching rest of kingdom\n\n\"Projected revenue growth:\"\n\nCurrent: ~9,000 florins (as we discussed)\n\nYear 2: ~15,000 florins\n\nYear 3+: 20,000-25,000 florins\n\n\"But,\" Diego cautions, \"aggressive taxation too early could trigger resistance. Better to build slowly and maintain stability.\"\n\n\"Fourth: New Trade Taxes\"\n\nÁlvaro returns to the map. \"Right now, most trade taxation is local - cities charge market fees, ports charge docking fees. The crown gets a percentage but doesn't control the system directly.\"\n\n\"Proposal: Crown takes direct control of major port customs.\"\n\n\"Instead of cities like Málaga collecting all customs revenue and paying the crown a share, reverse it: crown officials collect customs, cities receive a share. This is how Venice and Genoa do it.\"\n\n\"Resistance expected from city councils who profit from current system. But you have the authority - conquered territories allow you to establish new systems without negotiating with entrenched interests.\"\n\n\"Estimated additional revenue: 8,000-12,000 florins annually from major ports.\"\n\n\"Fifth: Royal Monopolies\"\n\n\"Granada produces valuable commodities: silk, sugar, dried fruit, certain dyes. Under the old system, these were privately traded. You could establish crown monopolies - require all production to be sold through royal agents who take a percentage.\"\n\n\"Controversial - will anger merchants and producers. But potentially very profitable.\"\n\n\"Historical precedent: Aragonese crown holds salt monopoly, Castilian crown has some mineral monopolies. Could extend to Granada's luxury goods.\"\n\n\"Estimated revenue: 5,000-8,000 florins if carefully managed.\"\n\nÁlvaro sits back down. \"Your Majesty, combining all of these - careful taxation in Granada, Mediterranean trade development, port customs control, possibly some monopolies - we could add another 30,000-50,000 florins to annual crown revenue within 3-5 years. That would nearly double current crown income.\"\n\n\"But,\" he cautions, \"these aren't simple reforms like hiring better tax collectors. They require:**\"\n\nDiplomatic negotiations with Italian city-states\n\nEstablishing crown administrators in ports (displacing city authorities)\n\nBuilding customs infrastructure (warehouses, inspection facilities)\n\nPotentially military enforcement against smugglers\n\nManaging Muslim population reactions to increased taxation\n\nDeveloping treaty framework with Morocco\n\nResisting merchant lobbying and city council complaints\n\n\"This is a multi-year strategic program, not something we can implement in months. But the opportunities are real and enormous.\"\n\nDiego adds: \"And Your Majesty, this doesn't even touch the really ambitious ideas. Like chartering a royal trading company to compete with Genoese merchants. Or establishing formal monopoly on trans-Saharan gold trade routes if we extend into Morocco. Or developing naval dominance in western Mediterranean to charge 'protection fees' like Venice does. Those are decade-long projects but potentially transform Castile into a major commercial power, not just a military one.\"\n\nÁlvaro meets your eyes. \"The question is: how aggressively do you want to move? Conservative approach - careful taxation increases, gradual trade development - gets you perhaps 20,000 florins additional revenue with low risk. Aggressive approach - crown control of ports, monopolies, Morocco expansion - could get you 50,000+ florins but with political and military costs.\"\n\n\"What's your appetite for risk, Your Majesty?\""

          "text": "Álvaro straightens, clearly pleased you're engaging with the commercial strategy in detail. He pulls out a fresh piece of parchment and begins sketching out the mechanics.\n\n\"Let me break down the Mediterranean trade development systematically, Your Majesty. This is complex, but potentially transformative for crown revenues.\"\n\nI. THE CURRENT MEDITERRANEAN TRADE SYSTEM\n\n\"First, understand what you've inherited,\" Álvaro begins. \"Granada's ports - especially Málaga - were major hubs under Muslim rule. Ships from Genoa, Venice, Pisa, Barcelona, Alexandria, and even Ottoman territories traded there regularly.\"\n\n\"What they traded:\"\n\nExports from Granada: Silk, sugar, dried fruits, almonds, leather goods, ceramics, certain dyes\n\nImports to Granada: Grain, timber, metals, textiles, spices from the East\n\nTransit trade: Goods passing through on their way elsewhere\n\n\"The old Muslim system:\"\n\nGranada charged flat docking fees per ship\n\nMarket fees on goods sold in Granada itself\n\nNo systematic customs duties on goods in transit\n\nIndividual merchant families negotiated their own arrangements\n\n\"Result: Ports were profitable but not optimized for royal revenue. Much of the wealth went to local merchant families and city governments rather than the Nasrid sultanate. You've inherited this inefficient system.\"\n\nII. ESTABLISHING CROWN CUSTOMS CONTROL\n\n\"The Core Investment Required:\"\n\nÁlvaro sketches an organizational chart:\n\nA. Physical Infrastructure (One-Time Costs):\n\nItem\nPurpose\nEstimated Cost\nCustoms houses (4-5 major ports)\nInspection facilities, offices, secure storage\n8,000-12,000 florins\nWarehouse construction\nBonded storage for goods awaiting clearance\n5,000-8,000 florins\nWeighing stations & equipment\nAccurate assessment of cargo value\n2,000-3,000 florins\nSecure docking facilities\nPrevent smuggling via hidden coves\n4,000-6,000 florins\nTotal Infrastructure\n\n19,000-29,000 florins\n\n\"This is substantial but one-time. Once built, facilities last decades.\"\n\nB. Personnel (Annual Operating Costs):\n\nPosition\nNumber Needed\nAnnual Cost Each\nTotal Annual\nPort Customs Masters\n5-6 (one per major port)\n800 florins\n4,800 florins\nInspectors & assessors\n40-50 total\n200 florins\n8,000-10,000 florins\nGuards & enforcement\n100-120\n120 florins\n12,000-14,400 florins\nClerks & administrators\n25-30\n150 florins\n3,750-4,500 florins\nTotal Personnel\n\n28,550-33,700 florins/year\n\n\"This is expensive, Your Majesty. But compare to projected revenue of 15,000-20,000 florins annually from customs... wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me recalculate.\"\n\nDiego interjects: \"Your Majesty, those are operating costs assuming you're paying everyone. But traditionally, port customs systems are self-financing. The customs revenue pays for the customs administration, with surplus going to crown.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"Exactly. So the real calculation:\"\n\nNet Revenue Projection:\n\nGross customs revenue: 45,000-55,000 florins annually (once fully operational)\n\nOperating costs: 28,000-34,000 florins annually\n\nNet to crown: 15,000-20,000 florins annually\n\n\"The infrastructure investment (19,000-29,000 florins) pays for itself in 2-3 years.\"\n\nC. Implementation Timeline:\n\n\"This isn't instant,\" Álvaro warns. \"Full implementation takes 18-24 months:\"\n\nMonths 1-3: Design customs system, hire Port Customs Masters, begin infrastructure construction\n\nMonths 4-9: Build facilities, train inspectors, establish procedures\n\nMonths 10-12: Pilot program in Málaga (largest port)\n\nMonths 13-18: Expand to other ports, refine systems\n\nMonths 19-24: Full operation across all major ports\n\n\"Revenue starts small during pilot phase, grows as system expands.\"\n\nIII. THE TRADE DELEGATION TO ITALIAN CITIES\n\n\"Yes, you can send a delegation immediately,\" Álvaro says emphatically. \"In fact, you should. Here's why and how:\"\n\nA. Why Italian Cities Matter:\n\n\"Genoa, Venice, Pisa, and Florence dominate Mediterranean trade. They have established merchant colonies in every major port. If you want to maximize customs revenue, you need them trading through YOUR ports rather than bypassing them or negotiating sweetheart deals that avoid customs.\"\n\nB. The Delegation Composition:\n\n\"I recommend a delegation of 6-8 people:\"\n\nLead negotiator: Someone with diplomatic experience and commercial knowledge (perhaps Don Fadrique, or a merchant with noble status)\n\nLegal expert: Someone who understands maritime law and trade treaties\n\nFinancial administrator: Diego or someone from treasury to calculate tax rates\n\nMilitary representative: To discuss security guarantees for merchant convoys\n\nTranslator: Italian-speaking (many at court speak Italian, not a problem)\n\nClergy: Cardinal Capranica might provide letter of introduction to Italian church officials\n\n\"Cost: 3,000-5,000 florins for 6-month mission (travel, lodging, gifts, bribes, entertainment)\"\n\nC. What They Would Negotiate:\n\nÁlvaro lists them systematically:\n\n1. New Trade Treaty Framework\n\n\"Replace the ad-hoc arrangements from Granada's Muslim period with formal agreements.\"\n\nKey terms to negotiate:\n\nCustoms Rates:\n\nStandard rate: 8-10% ad valorem (8-10% of cargo value) for most goods\n\nReduced rate: 4-5% for strategic goods (grain, timber, metals Castile needs)\n\nLuxury rate: 12-15% for high-value goods (spices, silk, precious metals)\n\n\"Italian cities will push for flat fees or very low rates. You want percentages of value because as trade grows, revenue grows automatically.\"\n\nExclusive Trading Rights:\n\nGenoa gets preferential rates at Málaga (their traditional port)\n\nVenice gets preferential rates at Almería\n\nBut both still pay customs - just 1-2% less than competitors\n\n\"This lets you play them against each other. Neither wants to lose advantage to the other.\"\n\nSecurity Guarantees:\n\nCrown provides naval patrols against pirates\n\nMerchant convoys receive military escort (for fee)\n\nDisputes resolved in royal courts with fair treatment guaranteed\n\n\"Italian merchants care deeply about security and legal protection. Offer both.\"\n\nMost Favored Nation Clauses:\n\nIf you later give better terms to another Italian city, existing partners automatically get same terms\n\nThis prevents you from being played against yourself\n\n2. Dispute Resolution Mechanisms\n\n\"How are disagreements handled?\"\n\nMixed tribunals (Castilian judge + Italian merchant representative)\n\nAppeals to royal court\n\nClear procedures prevent diplomatic incidents\n\n3. Port Access and Facilities\n\n\"What rights do Italian merchants have in your ports?\"\n\nWarehouse rental rights\n\nPermission to maintain factor houses (permanent representatives)\n\nAccess to local markets\n\nDuration of stay allowances\n\n4. Trade Volume Commitments\n\n\"Can you require minimum trade flows?\"\n\nGenoa commits to 30+ ships annually through Málaga\n\nVenice commits to 20+ ships through Almería\n\nFailure to meet commitments = loss of preferential rates\n\n\"This ensures your ports become major hubs, not backwaters.\"\n\nD. Negotiation Leverage:\n\n\"What do you offer to get good terms?\"\n\nYour Advantages:\n\nGeography: Your ports are perfectly positioned for North Africa, Levant, and Atlantic trade\n\nMálaga's Harbor: One of Mediterranean's best natural ports\n\nGranada Goods: Access to silk, sugar, leather - valuable exports\n\nSecurity: You can guarantee convoy protection with your navy\n\nStability: Christian rule is more predictable than the dying Nasrid sultanate was\n\nYour Demands:\n\nFair customs rates that generate real revenue\n\nNo tax evasion or smuggling\n\nRespect for royal authority\n\nVolume commitments\n\n\"Don't undersell your position, Your Majesty. Genoa and Venice need reliable Mediterranean ports. You have them.\"\n\nIV. LICENSING MERCHANT FLEETS\n\n\"This is more subtle,\" Álvaro explains, \"but potentially very profitable.\"\n\nA. The Concept:\n\n\"Under a licensing system, foreign merchant ships cannot trade in Castilian ports without a royal license. The license grants specific rights and requires specific payments.\"\n\nHow It Works:\n\n1. Annual Licenses (Fleet-Wide):\n\nA merchant company (like \"Grimaldi Brothers Trading House of Genoa\") purchases an annual license:\n\nCost: 1,500-3,000 florins depending on fleet size\n\nRights granted: Up to 20 ships may dock at any Castilian port\n\nTerms: Must pay standard customs, obey port regulations, allow inspections\n\nDuration: One calendar year, renewable\n\n\"The license fee is separate from customs duties. It's essentially paying for the privilege of access.\"\n\n2. Individual Ship Licenses:\n\nFor merchants without fleet licenses:\n\nCost: 150-300 florins per ship per year\n\nSame rights and obligations\n\n\"This encourages merchants to buy fleet licenses (more profitable for you) rather than per-ship licenses.\"\n\n3. Exclusivity Premiums:\n\nFor premium fees, offer exclusive rights:\n\nExclusive silk export license: Only license-holder can export Granada silk to Italy\n\nCost: 5,000-8,000 florins annually\n\nBenefit to crown: Auction these monopolies to highest bidder\n\n\"Genoese and Venetian merchants will pay enormously for exclusive access to valuable commodities.\"\n\nB. Revenue Projections from Licensing:\n\nLicense Type\nNumber Issued\nPrice Each\nAnnual Revenue\nMajor fleet licenses (10+ ships)\n8-12\n2,500 florins\n20,000-30,000 florins\nMid-size fleet licenses (5-9 ships)\n15-20\n1,500 florins\n22,500-30,000 florins\nIndividual ship licenses\n40-60\n200 florins\n8,000-12,000 florins\nExclusive commodity licenses\n3-5\n6,000 florins\n18,000-30,000 florins\nTotal Licensing Revenue\n\n68,500-102,000 florins/year\n\nÁlvaro pauses. \"That's... much higher than I initially estimated. If we implement aggressive licensing on top of customs, total port revenue could be 80,000-120,000 florins annually.\"\n\nDiego looks skeptical. \"That seems too high. Would merchants pay both customs AND license fees?\"\n\n\"They would if they want access to profitable routes,\" Álvaro argues. \"Venice already does this in the Adriatic - you can't trade in Venetian ports without paying them tribute essentially. We'd be copying their model.\"\n\nC. Enforcement:\n\n\"How do you prevent unlicensed ships from trading?\"\n\n1. Port Inspections:\n\nEvery ship must present license upon arrival\n\nNo license = cargo impounded until fees paid (with penalty)\n\nRepeat offenders = permanent ban\n\n2. Naval Patrols:\n\nRoyal galleys patrol coastline\n\nIntercept ships attempting to bypass major ports and dock in hidden coves\n\nSmuggling penalties: confiscation of cargo + fine equal to cargo value\n\n3. Merchant Registration:\n\nAll foreign merchants trading in Castile must register with crown\n\nRegistration includes background check, financial verification\n\nUnregistered merchants = no legal protection for their contracts\n\n\"This requires the naval infrastructure you're building anyway for coastal defense. Dual purpose.\"\n\nV. INTEGRATION WITH BROADER STRATEGY\n\nÁlvaro steps back from details. \"Your Majesty, this all fits together:\"\n\nPhase 1 (1433-1434): Foundation\n\nBuild customs infrastructure (19,000-29,000 florins investment)\n\nSend trade delegation to Italy (4,000-5,000 florins)\n\nEstablish basic licensing system\n\nPilot in Málaga\n\nPhase 2 (1434-1435): Expansion\n\nExtend to all major ports\n\nImplement full licensing system\n\nNegotiate treaties with Italian cities\n\nBegin naval patrol enforcement\n\nPhase 3 (1435+): Optimization\n\nAuction exclusive commodity licenses\n\nExpand to North African trade\n\nDevelop royal trading company (if desired)\n\nMaximize revenue from established system\n\nTotal Initial Investment: ~25,000-35,000 florins\nBreak-Even Timeline: 18-24 months\nSteady-State Annual Revenue: 60,000-90,000 florins (conservative) or potentially 80,000-120,000 florins (aggressive licensing)\n\n\"This transforms crown finances, Your Majesty. It's the difference between scraping by on 130,000 florins annual revenue and having 200,000+ florins - enough to fund permanent professional armies, build permanent institutions, dominate Iberian politics.\"\n\nDiego adds: \"And it's sustainable. Once the system is built, it runs itself and grows with trade volume. Every year, Mediterranean commerce grows, and your revenue grows with it.\"\n\nÁlvaro meets your eyes. \"The question is: do you want to make this investment? It requires significant upfront capital, diplomatic effort, and administrative capacity. But the return is transformative.\"\n\nWhat do you say?"

We've been fighting over maravedís from nobles when there are florins - tens of thousands of florins - waiting in Mediterranean commerce. This is how kingdoms become wealthy.\"\n\nÁlvaro stands. \"The budget projections - yes, absolutely I can do this. Diego and I will need the evening to compile everything, but we'll have comprehensive 1433 budgets for both treasuries ready by morning.\"\n\nHe begins making notes. \"Let me confirm what we're incorporating:\"\n\nFor Crusade Treasury:\n\nCurrent balance\n\nExpected taxation revenue (expires Dec 31, 1433)\n\nGarrison costs for Granada\n\nAcademy operational costs\n\nReserves for potential operations\n\nFor Crown Treasury:\n\nTraditional revenues (improved through Diego's reforms)\n\nNew revenue from confiscated estates (under new contracts)\n\nInfantes' estates (full administration)\n\nGranada territorial revenues (conservative first-year estimates)\n\nNew: Mediterranean customs revenue (phased implementation)\n\nNew: Fleet licensing revenue (phased implementation)\n\nNew: Council of Great Houses compliance improvements\n\nInfrastructure investments required\n\nOperating costs\n\n\"This will show both current reality and projected 2-3 year trajectory as systems mature. You'll see exactly where the kingdom is financially and where it's going.\"\n\nDiego adds: \"And Your Majesty, the contrast will be striking. Crown revenue could grow from 130,000 florins to potentially 250,000+ florins within three years if these commercial reforms succeed. That's not incremental improvement - that's transformation.\"\n\nI'll create this comprehensive budget document now. It will take some time to compile all the numbers systematically. Let me get to work.\n\nCreate File: Creating comprehensive 1433 budget projections for both Crusade and Crown treasuries, incorporating all discussed reforms and new revenue streams\n\nThought process\n\nThe document has been created successfully. Now I need to copy it to the outputs directory so the user can access it, and then present it to the user in-character as Álvaro and Diego delivering the completed budget analysis.\n\nThe next morning, Álvaro and Diego return to your study with a thick document bound in leather. Both look tired but satisfied - clearly they worked through the night.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Álvaro begins, setting the document on your desk, \"the comprehensive budget analysis you requested. Both treasuries, all reforms incorporated, Mediterranean commerce projections included.\"\n\nDiego adds, opening to the summary pages: \"We've organized it into six main sections - crusade treasury, crown treasury, consolidated finances, strategic analysis, recommendations, and risk factors.\"\n\nView the Complete 1433 Budget Projections\n\nÁlvaro points to key findings. \"The headline numbers, Your Majesty:\"\n\n\"Crusade Treasury: Currently 368,000 florins. After 1433 expenses, still 326,000 florins. Fully funded for years, even if taxation expires.\"\n\n\"Crown Treasury: Currently 189,000 florins. With all reforms and new revenue streams, projected to reach 229,000 florins by year-end 1433. That's a 21% increase in a single year.\"\n\n\"Combined kingdom resources: 555,000 florins by end of 1433. For context, Your Majesty, that's more than the Kingdom of Aragon commands in total.\"\n\nDiego flips to the revenue breakdown. \"But the really transformative numbers are in the multi-year projections. Look at 1435:\"\n\n\"Crown revenues projected at 275,000 florins annually. That's more than triple what your father's government collected in 1425. And it's sustainable - these aren't one-time windfalls but permanent structural improvements.\"\n\nÁlvaro taps the Mediterranean commerce section. \"This is the game-changer. If the trade initiative succeeds - and I believe it will - it adds 80,000 to 120,000 florins annually by 1435. That single initiative generates more revenue than all the crusade taxation we've collected in two years.\"\n\n\"Which means,\" Diego interjects, \"the question of whether to extend crusade taxation becomes almost... optional. Nice to have, but not essential. The Mediterranean commerce dwarfs it.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"We've included strategic recommendations at the end. Short version: approve the Council of Great Houses, launch the Mediterranean trade initiative immediately, and position yourself to declare 'eternal crusade' for North Africa if you want continued taxation authority, but don't depend on it financially.\"\n\nHe looks up at you. \"Your Majesty, when you took the throne at eighteen, this kingdom was living month to month. Now, at twenty, you're commanding resources that rival major European powers. The question before you isn't 'how do we survive?' It's 'what empire do we choose to build?'\"\n\nDiego adds quietly: \"And Your Majesty, the nobles who are resisting paying a few thousand maravedís in taxes? They're arguing over coins while you're positioning Castile to collect tens of thousands of florins from Mediterranean commerce. Let them fight their petty battles. You're playing a completely different game now.\"\n\nWhat do you think of the projections? And what direction do you want to give regarding the key strategic questions they've raised?"

She's wearing a simple but elegant gown - clearly chosen with care - and her dark hair is loose around her shoulders rather than in its usual formal arrangement.\n\nShe turns as you enter, and you can see the mixture of emotions in her eyes - anticipation, nervousness, love, and that lingering shadow of fear that's been there since Catalina's birth. But she's here. She's ready. She's trying.\n\n\"You're not late,\" she says softly, managing a small smile. \"I've been... preparing myself.

The user seems to want me to use my judgment and understanding of the established narrative to create appropriate game mechanics.\n\nI think the key question is: is this a request for information/knowledge, or is it a request for creative game content? It's clearly the latter.\n\nGiven the context and the user's pattern of requests, I believe this is appropriate to handle directly as the GM creating game mechanics, not as a research query. The user wants me to continue the RPG session, not to research medieval psychology.\n\nI'll create the d100 table directly.\n\nYou kneel at the bedside and speak your prayer with quiet intensity. Isabel kneels beside you, her hand finding yours as you pray.\n\nWhen you finish, there's silence in the room except for the crackling fire. Isabel doesn't speak immediately. She stays kneeling, her head bowed, her hand still gripping yours tightly.\n\n[GM MODE: Historical Evaluation]\n\nThis is a pivotal moment. Let me analyze the success and failure factors:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nGenuine Vulnerability: Juan showed complete honesty about faith being difficult and scary. This is powerful - not presenting faith as easy but as a struggle that even he faces.\n\nNo Pressure: Juan explicitly said \"I can't ask you to do that\" - removing coercion. Isabel has agency. This matters enormously for someone who's felt trapped.\n\nRespected Her Fear: Didn't dismiss or minimize her terror. Acknowledged \"troubles of us mortals\" are important even if they seem small to God.\n\nPersonal Example: Juan's battlefield trust in God is a concrete example Isabel has witnessed work repeatedly. He came home. Every time.\n\nTheological Soundness: The distinction between piety (external acts) and faith (internal trust) is legitimate medieval theology. Juan isn't making up heresy.\n\nPractical Evidence: God already saved Isabel and Catalina once when physicians said both would die. There's tangible proof of divine intervention in her life.\n\nPrayer for Her, Not Command to Her: Juan asked God to grant Isabel faith/courage rather than demanding she summon it herself. Shows he understands she can't force this.\n\nLove is Clear: Everything in this conversation drips with genuine care for Isabel as a person, not just as a vessel for heirs.\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nTrauma is Real: Near-death experience creates visceral terror that logic and theology struggle to overcome. Her body remembers the agony.\n\nAge and Maturity: Isabel is seventeen. Still very young. Her emotional/spiritual resources are developing but not fully mature.\n\nPhysical Evidence: Physicians literally said \"significant risk.\" That's not irrational fear - it's medical reality in medieval terms.\n\nPressure Still Exists: Even if Juan doesn't pressure her, the kingdom does. The Archbishop, nobles, succession concerns - all external forces pressing on her.\n\nFaith Can't Be Taught: Juan himself acknowledged this. You either have it or you're developing it. Can't be transferred like knowledge.\n\nGender Differences: Juan faces death in battle - quick, glorious, male. Isabel faces death in childbirth - slow, agonizing, female. These aren't equivalent experiences.\n\nLoneliness of Female Experience: Juan has never been pregnant, never felt a baby turn wrong inside him, never hemorrhaged for hours. There's a gulf of experience he can't cross.\n\nDepression/Trauma Symptoms: Post-traumatic stress from the birth could be affecting her ability to feel hope or trust.\n\nTHE CRITICAL QUESTION:\n\nCan Isabel's rational/spiritual mind override her traumatized body's terror? Can theological reasoning and love from Juan break through visceral fear?\n\nLet me create the table:\n\nISABEL'S RESPONSE TO JUAN'S PRAYER (d100)\n\nContext: After near-death childbirth trauma, Isabel must reconcile deep physical terror with faith, duty, and love. Juan has offered vulnerability, prayer, and respect for her agency rather than pressure.\n\nFAITH CANNOT OVERCOME TRAUMA (1-12)\n\nThe terror is too recent, too visceral. Theology can't touch it.\n\n1-5: Breakdown\n\nIsabel tries to respond but sobs overwhelm her\n\n\"I can't, Juan. I can't. I want to believe but I'm too afraid.\"\n\nClings to him desperately\n\n\"I'm failing you. I'm failing the kingdom. But I can't stop being afraid.\"\n\nNeeds weeks/months of gradual healing before she can approach this again\n\nOutcome: No intimacy tonight. Need different approach to address trauma first.\n\n6-9: Honest Admission of Incapacity\n\n\"Juan, I heard every word you said. I understand what you mean.\"\n\n\"But I can't make myself have that faith right now. The fear is too strong.\"\n\n\"I know you need an heir. I know what's at stake. But I need more time.\"\n\nApologetic but firm - she's not ready\n\nOutcome: No intimacy tonight. But opened honest dialogue about timeline.\n\n10-12: Conflicted Paralysis\n\nIsabel kneels silently, torn between duty and terror\n\nWants to be brave, can't force herself past the fear\n\n\"What if I fail you? What if I try and can't... can't go through with it?\"\n\nSpiraling into anxiety about disappointing Juan on top of existing fear\n\nOutcome: Can attempt intimacy if Juan pushes gently, but Isabel will be emotionally distant/dissociated. Not healthy foundation.\n\nSIGNIFICANT RESISTANCE (13-28)\n\nIsabel understands intellectually but emotionally struggles greatly.\n\n13-18: Willing But Terrified\n\n\"I'll try, Juan. For you. For Castile.\"\n\nClear this is duty-driven, not faith-driven\n\nBody language tense, fear visible\n\n\"Just... please be gentle. And if I can't do this, please don't be angry.\"\n\nOutcome: Can proceed but Isabel will be fearful throughout. May develop negative associations with intimacy.\n\n19-23: Negotiating Conditions\n\n\"Can we... not try for a baby tonight? Can we just be together?\"\n\n\"Maybe if we start slowly, I can work up to the courage?\"\n\nWants physical intimacy but trying to separate it from pregnancy risk\n\nOutcome: Intimacy possible but incomplete (withdrawal/avoiding conception). Better emotionally but doesn't address succession need.\n\n24-28: Bargaining with God\n\nIsabel prays silently after Juan finishes\n\nTries to make deals: \"If I survive another birth, I'll endow a monastery...\"\n\nAttempting to find faith through transactional thinking\n\nNot true trust yet, but trying to build scaffolding toward it\n\nOutcome: Willing to try but approach feels forced/transactional rather than genuine faith.\n\nMIXED RESPONSE (29-58)\n\nJuan's words are helping but the journey to faith is incomplete.\n\n29-38: Gradual Opening\n\nIsabel stays kneeling in silence for several minutes\n\nProcessing, praying on her own\n\nFinally: \"You're right. God did save us once. Maybe... maybe He will again.\"\n\nVoice uncertain but considering it seriously\n\n\"I'm still afraid. But I can try to trust. I think.\"\n\nOutcome: Willing to be intimate with moderate anxiety. Not overcome fear but choosing to act despite it.\n\n39-48: Intellectual Acceptance, Emotional Hesitation\n\n\"What you said about faith versus piety - I understand now.\"\n\n\"And I see that I've been trying to control everything through prayer rather than trusting.\"\n\n\"But knowing that intellectually and feeling it are different things.\"\n\nWants to have faith but can't fully manufacture the emotional reality yet\n\nOutcome: Will proceed out of love for Juan and duty, with moderate discomfort. Building toward faith but not there yet.\n\n49-58: Seeking Courage in Juan\n\n\"I don't know if I have enough faith in God yet. But I have faith in you.\"\n\n\"You've never let me down. You've always come back. You've always protected me.\"\n\n\"So even though I'm afraid, I'll trust you. And through you, maybe I can learn to trust God.\"\n\nUsing Juan as intermediary to faith rather than direct connection\n\nOutcome: Intimacy with Juan as her anchor point. Emotionally healthier than pure duty. Progress toward faith.\n\nGOOD RESPONSE (59-78)\n\nJuan's approach is working. Isabel finding path through fear toward trust.\n\n59-68: Fragile Faith Emerging\n\nAfter long silence: \"I felt something when you prayed. Something... peaceful.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's God's answer? The fear is still there, but it's... quieter now.\"\n\n\"I'm not completely brave yet. But I think I can do this.\"\n\nSmall breakthrough - experiencing divine presence rather than just thinking about it\n\nOutcome: Intimacy with reduced anxiety. Isabel still nervous but experiencing beginning of genuine faith rather than just willpower.\n\n69-74: Remembering Evidence\n\n\"You're right. The physicians said we'd both die. And here we are.\"\n\n\"And Catalina is perfect. So healthy despite everything.\"\n\n\"Maybe... maybe that was God showing me He had a purpose for us?\"\n\nConnecting past evidence to present situation\n\nFear still present but overruled by rational/spiritual reasoning\n\nOutcome: Willing and relatively calm. Using evidence of God's past protection to override present fear. Solid foundation.\n\n75-78: Trust Through Love\n\n\"I love you, Juan. That's not in doubt.\"\n\n\"And I trust that you wouldn't ask this of me if you didn't believe it was right.\"\n\n\"So I'll trust your faith, even when my own wavers.\"\n\n\"Hold me tight. Remind me I'm not alone in this.\"\n\nDrawing strength from relationship while working toward independent faith\n\nOutcome: Emotionally healthy intimacy. Using love as bridge to faith. Fear present but manageable.\n\nEXCEPTIONAL RESPONSE (79-92)\n\nGenuine spiritual breakthrough. Isabel finding her own faith.\n\n79-85: Moment of Grace\n\nIsabel continues praying silently after Juan finishes\n\nSeveral minutes pass\n\nWhen she looks up, something has shifted in her expression\n\n\"I asked God to take away my fear. And He... He reminded me that even Mary was afraid.\"\n\n\"The angel had to tell her 'be not afraid' because she was terrified.\"\n\n\"Fear doesn't mean I lack faith. It means I'm human.\"\n\nReframing: can have both faith AND fear simultaneously\n\nOutcome: Peaceful acceptance. Isabel understands she can be afraid and faithful at the same time. Healthy integration of emotion and belief.\n\n86-89: Surrendering Control\n\n\"You're right. I've been trying to control everything through prayer.\"\n\n\"But faith means letting go. Trusting the outcome to God even if I can't see it.\"\n\nVisible relaxation in her posture - physical manifestation of spiritual release\n\n\"I don't know what will happen. But I know God has a purpose.\"\n\n\"And if that purpose includes another child, then... then I trust Him.\"\n\nGenuine surrender rather than forced compliance\n\nOutcome: True peace. Isabel has made spiritual leap into trust. Intimacy flows naturally from this emotional/spiritual state.\n\n90-92: Prophetic Certainty\n\nAfter praying, Isabel opens her eyes with unusual clarity\n\n\"God will protect me. I know it now. I don't know how I know, but I'm certain.\"\n\nSome kind of spiritual experience during prayer - felt divine reassurance\n\n\"The fear is still there, but it's... underneath something stronger now.\"\n\n\"I'm ready, Juan. Not just because I should be, but because I want to trust God with this.\"\n\nOutcome: Complete transformation. Isabel has experienced genuine divine encounter that eclipses her trauma. Rare but historically documented phenomenon.\n\nEXTRAORDINARY OUTCOME (93-100)\n\nUnexpected depth of response creates transformative moment.\n\n93-95: Theological Insight\n\n\"Juan, I just realized something.\"\n\n\"You said God has a purpose for this kingdom. But what if...what if the purpose isn't just military victories?\"\n\n\"What if the purpose is showing that faith and fear can coexist? That we can trust God even in our weakness?\"\n\nDeveloping her own theological framework rather than just accepting Juan's\n\n\"Maybe my fear isn't something to overcome. Maybe it's part of the testimony.\"\n\nOutcome: Deep spiritual maturity emerging. Isabel becoming theological partner rather than just follower.\n\n96-97: Role Reversal\n\nIsabel takes Juan's hands\n\n\"Let me pray for you now.\"\n\nPrays for Juan's protection in future battles, for wisdom in ruling, for their family\n\nHer prayer is surprisingly confident and mature\n\nJuan realizes Isabel has her own direct relationship with God he hadn't fully recognized\n\nOutcome: Relationship deepened. Isabel demonstrating spiritual strength. Partnership rather than hierarchy.\n\n98-99: Joyful Faith\n\nAfter praying, Isabel actually laughs through her tears\n\n\"I've been so afraid of death that I forgot to trust in life.\"\n\n\"God gave us Catalina. He gave us this kingdom. He gave us each other.\"\n\n\"Why would He give us all this just to take it away?\"\n\nShift from fear-focus to gratitude-focus\n\n\"I'm ready, Juan. And not because I'm forcing myself. Because I want to.\"\n\nOutcome: Complete emotional/spiritual transformation. Fear remains but joy and trust are stronger. Healthiest possible foundation.\n\n100: Miraculous Moment\n\nAs Isabel prays, candles flicker though there's no wind\n\nBoth feel a presence in the room - peaceful, reassuring\n\nIsabel's expression becomes radiant\n\n\"He's here, Juan. God is here with us.\"\n\nMystical experience that both witness\n\nAll fear drains from Isabel's face\n\n\"I'm not just trusting in faith. I'm trusting in His actual presence.\"\n\nOutcome: Profound shared spiritual experience. Creates unshakeable foundation for Isabel's faith going forward. Rare grace.\n\nRoll d100 to determine Isabel's response to Juan's prayer and words about faith.\n\nThe table reflects:\n\nTrauma is real and powerful (1-28 range shows significant resistance)\n\nMiddle ranges (29-78) most likely - progress but imperfect\n\nGenuine breakthroughs possible (79-100) given Juan's sensitive approach\n\nHistorical realism: medieval women DID develop deep faith despite fear, but it was often a journey, not instant transformation\n\nWhat do you roll?"

          "text": "You finish your prayer and there's a profound silence in the room. Isabel remains kneeling beside you, her hand still gripping yours tightly, her head bowed. The fire crackles. Candles flicker gently.\n\nFor long minutes, she says nothing. You can feel her breathing slow, deepen. Her grip on your hand gradually loosens from desperate clutching to gentle holding.\n\nThen she begins to pray, her voice barely above a whisper:\n\n\"Lord... I have been trying to control You with my prayers. Asking for safety as if I could bargain with You. Attending Mass as if keeping score would protect me.\"\n\nHer voice grows slightly stronger.\n\n\"But that's not faith. That's... fear pretending to be piety.\"\n\nShe's quiet again for a moment, then:\n\n\"You saved me once. When the physicians said we would both die, when I felt myself slipping away into darkness, You brought me back. You gave me Catalina. You brought Juan home to me.\"\n\nHer hand tightens on yours again, but differently now - not clinging in desperation but holding in connection.\n\n\"I've been so afraid of what might happen that I forgot to trust in what You've already done.\"\n\nShe lifts her head and opens her eyes, looking at you. There are still tears on her cheeks, but her expression has changed. The raw terror has... not disappeared, but receded beneath something else. Something calmer. Clearer.\n\n\"Juan,\" she says softly, \"I think I understand now what you mean by faith. It's not the absence of fear. It's...\" she searches for words, \"...it's trusting even with the fear. Mary was afraid when the angel came to her. But she said 'let it be unto me according to Your word' anyway.\"\n\nShe takes both your hands in hers now.\n\n\"I'm still afraid. I won't lie to you and say I'm not. My body remembers what happened. The pain, the blood, feeling myself dying...\" She swallows hard. \"That fear doesn't just vanish because I pray about it.\"\n\n\"But...\" and here her voice gains quiet strength, \"...I can trust God despite the fear. I can choose to believe He has a purpose even when I can't see it. I can surrender control even when everything in me wants to hold on tight.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hands.\n\n\"You walk into battles trusting God will protect you. You don't know you won't be killed - you could be. But you trust anyway. You choose to trust.\" Her eyes search yours. \"I can do that too. I can choose to trust that God will see me through whatever comes, even if I'm afraid of it.\"\n\nA small, tremulous smile appears on her face - the first genuine smile you've seen from her in this entire conversation.\n\n\"It's not brave. It's not confident. It's just... surrender. Letting go of trying to control everything and trusting that God's purpose is bigger than my fear.\"\n\nShe stands, pulling you up with her, and steps closer until she's looking up at you.\n\n\"Hold me,\" she whispers. \"Not because I'm commanded to do my duty. Not because the kingdom needs an heir. But because I choose to trust - trust in God, trust in you, trust in whatever purpose He has for us.\"\n\nThe fear is still visible in her eyes. But alongside it now is something else - peace. Not the peace of certainty, but the peace of surrender. The peace of choosing trust despite the terror.\n\n\"I'm ready,\" she says softly. \"And I mean it. Not forcing myself. Not just submitting. But choosing this. Choosing to trust God with my life, with our future, with whatever comes.\"\n\nShe reaches up to touch your face.\n\n\"Thank you for not demanding this of me. For kneeling to me. For praying for me instead of commanding me. For showing me that faith is... is its own kind of courage. The courage to let go.\"\n\nHer hand moves from your face to rest over your heart.\n\n\"I love you, Juan. And I trust you. And through you, I'm learning to trust God in a way I never understood before.\"\n\nA pause, then very quietly: \"Make love to your wife. Not to the Queen of Castile who needs to produce an heir. To Isabel. Your Isabel. Who chooses this freely, in faith and in love.\"\n\nThe transformation isn't complete - you can still see the shadow of fear in her eyes, the way her breathing catches slightly when she thinks about what might follow from this night. But the paralysis is broken. The terror no longer controls her.\n\nShe has found her own path to faith. Not by pretending the fear doesn't exist, but by choosing trust despite it.\n\nWhat do you do?"

She still trembles slightly - the fear hasn't vanished - but she's choosing to be here, choosing to trust.\n\n\"I love you,\" you tell her quietly. \"My Isabel.\"\n\n\"And I love you,\" she whispers back.\n\n[Narrative fades respectfully]\n\nMuch later, in the quiet darkness of your chambers with only the dying firelight casting shadows on the walls, Isabel lies against your chest. Her breathing has finally steadied. You can feel the warmth of her, the gentle rise and fall as she rests.\n\nAfter a long silence, she speaks softly: \"Thank you for being patient with me. For understanding.\"\n\nHer hand finds yours in the darkness. \"I'm still afraid of what might come. But I'm glad I didn't let the fear win. I'm glad we... that I chose this.\"\n\nShe's quiet for another moment, then: \"Whatever God's purpose is - whether it's another child or something else entirely - I'll try to trust it. Like you trust Him in battle.\"\n\nShe shifts to look up at you in the dim firelight. \"You need to sleep. Tomorrow there will be dukes to deal with, and tax collectors, and all the business of the kingdom. And I...\" a small smile, \"...I should probably pray. Properly this time. Not bargaining or begging, just... trusting.\"\n\nShe settles back against you. \"Stay with me tonight? Just tonight. Tomorrow you can go back to being the King who conquered Granada. But tonight, just be Juan. My husband.\"\n\nOutside the chamber windows, the night is deep and Toledo sleeps. The kingdom's business can wait until morning.\n\n[Time advances to the next morning, or whenever you wish to resume the kingdom's affairs. Where would you like to continue?]"
