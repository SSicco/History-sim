They should be well-equipped for both pilgrimage and potential combat.\n\nFrom the Character Database:\n- Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles is organizing the concentration of 800 crusaders\n- Marco Tornesi, Andrea Vescovi, Giovanni Rossi, Brother Guillem, Alonso Fernández are all part of this group\n- They're veteran crusaders who fought through the entire campaign\n\nI should describe:\n- Their equipment (weapons, armor, supplies)\n- Their organization (how they're structured)\n- Their readiness (morale, discipline, preparation)\n- Practical details (baggage train, supplies for sea voyage, horses)\n\nI should NOT write what Juan says or does - just describe what he would see when reviewing them.\n\nGranada, April 6, 1433 - Dawn\n\nThe crusaders are assembled in the great plaza before the Alhambra's western gates. Eight hundred men stand in ordered ranks beneath the morning sun, white tabards brilliant against the ochre stone of the fortress walls. Their red crosses - each sewn by hand during the early days in Barcelona, Seville, or JaÃ©n - mark them as something distinct from common soldiers.\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso de Robles has organized them into twenty companies of forty men each. Each company has a designated captain, mostly veterans who proved themselves at AlcalÃ¡, Loja, or the long siege of MÃ¡laga. Marco Tornesi stands at the head of the second company, his weathered face impassive. Andrea Vescovi - no longer the gangly farm boy who took the first oath in Barcelona - commands the ninth. Brother Guillem's company includes a disproportionate number of the learned crusaders, those who can read Latin and debate theology.\n\nTheir arms and equipment:\n\nEvery man carries a spear or pike - eight-foot ash shafts with steel points. Half have crossbows with full quivers; the other half have various weapons suited to their experience: swords, maces, war hammers, axes. Those who served as heavy infantry during the siege wear brigandine or mail shirts. The lighter troops have leather jerkins reinforced with metal studs.\n\nThey are armed, not ceremonial. These are the men who stormed the breach at Loja, who held the siege lines through summer fever at MÃ¡laga, who watched the Vega burn. They know their business.\n\nSupplies and logistics:\n\nA baggage train of forty mules carries:\n\nTents and camping equipment (for the overland portions)\n\nFood supplies for the march to MÃ¡laga (three days' journey)\n\nPersonal belongings and spare equipment\n\nThe sacred relics in their reinforced wooden cases\n\nIron-bound chests containing the crusade treasury (~315,500 florins)\n\nThe Guardian Company - twelve picked men including Sergeant GarcÃ­a and Corporal Rodrigo - will maintain constant watch over the relics and treasury throughout the journey.\n\nThe horses:\n\nTwo hundred horses for mounted sergeants and officers. The rest will march on foot, as they've done for two years. The horses will be useful if you encounter bandits or hostile forces on the road, though Captain Fernán has scouts reporting the coastal road to MÃ¡laga is secure - the western territories are firmly under Castilian control now.\n\nMorale and readiness:\n\nThey're tired - two years of hard campaigning shows in weathered faces and the way some favor old wounds - but they're also ready. They're going to Rome. They're carrying the True Cross and Santiago's bone back to the Holy Father. They witnessed the Te Deum yesterday, saw the Reconquista formally completed.\n\nThis is the culmination of their service, not just another march.\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles, Alfonso V's ambassador, stands apart from the crusaders with three Aragonese servants and two scribes. He's dressed for travel - practical riding clothes, not court finery - and has the look of a man who's made this Mediterranean crossing many times.\n\nThe morning air is cool, but it will be hot by midday. MÃ¡laga is three days south and west. The ships are waiting.\n\nCaptain Fernán approaches, salutes. \"Your Majesty. The men are ready. We can march within the hour if you give the word.\""

But I should show some of what they pass through to establish the world.\n\nGranada to Málaga - April 6, 1433\n\nThe roar that erupts from eight hundred throats echoes off the Alhambra's walls. \"Roma! Roma!\" They take up the cry, pikes and spears thrust skyward. \"Deus Vult!\" The ancient crusader shout, the same words shouted at Clermont three and a half centuries ago.\n\nThe white banner with the red cross unfurls as the Guardian Company takes position behind you. Captain Fernán raises his hand and the companies begin to move in ordered columns, four abreast. The rhythm of marching feet - eight hundred pairs, plus two hundred horses - creates a drumbeat that carries across the plaza.\n\nThe citizens of Granada - both Christian settlers and Muslim inhabitants - line the streets to watch you depart. Some kneel. Others simply stare. A few Christian women throw flowers. The Muslims watch in silence, faces unreadable. Their city has new masters, and those masters are leaving for Rome carrying proof of conquest.\n\nThe First Day - Through the Conquered Lands\n\nThe coastal road descends through the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. You pass villages that were battlegrounds two years ago - now flying Castilian banners. Almuñécar, where the western army landed in early 1431, is visible in the distance along the coast. Small fishing boats dot the harbor.\n\nThe countryside shows signs of the war's passage. Burned orchards that haven't fully recovered. A few abandoned farmsteads. But mostly: cultivation. The fields are planted. People are working them. Christian settlers and Muslim farmers side by side in some places, segregated in others. The land is healing.\n\nBy evening, you've covered fifteen miles. The crusaders make camp with practiced efficiency - tents raised, picket lines established, cook fires lit. Giovanni Rossi, the one-handed blacksmith who became a crusader in Barcelona, leads evening prayers. Eight hundred voices join in the Pater Noster.\n\nThe treasury chests and relic cases remain under constant guard. Four men of the Guardian Company, rotating every three hours.\n\nThe Second Day - The Coast Road\n\nThe mountains give way to coastal plains. The Mediterranean stretches azure to the south. The road improves - this was one of Granada's main routes, and it's been maintained since the conquest. You pass a coastal fortress that was taken without siege when its garrison accepted terms after Málaga fell. The Castilian banner flies from its tower.\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles rides beside you for a portion of the day. He's been mostly silent, observing your crusaders with the eye of an experienced diplomat. Finally he speaks:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I've seen many armies. Mercenary companies in Italy, the royal hosts of Aragón and France. These men...\" He gestures at the marching columns. \"They're different. It's not just discipline. They believe. His Majesty Alfonso will want to know how you forged this.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"And Pope Eugenius will see it too. Eight hundred men who completed the Reconquista, marching to return sacred relics and a fortune in florins. The Holy Father has heard many promises from many kings. You're bringing him proof.\"\n\nThe Third Day - Málaga\n\nYou crest a rise and there it is: Málaga, sprawling along its bay. The city you besieged and took in fourteen days during the summer of 1431. The Alcazaba fortress rises on its hill. The harbor bristles with masts - and among them, larger than the fishing boats and coastal traders, you can see them:\n\nThe Genoese ships. Ten of them. Deep-hulled carracks and galleys capable of the open Mediterranean crossing. They're flying Genoese colors and, on the lead vessel, what appears to be a banner prepared for your arrival.\n\nThe crusaders see it too. A cheer ripples through the ranks. After two years fighting in Granada's mountains and valleys, the sight of ships waiting to carry them to Rome makes it real.\n\nCaptain Fernán rides up. \"Your Majesty, should we make camp outside the city tonight and embark tomorrow morning? Or proceed directly to the harbor?\""

Based on typical medieval march schedules, they would have started early (dawn), marched through the morning and early afternoon, and would be arriving in the late afternoon.\n\nI should give a clear, simple answer about the time without narrating any actions for Juan or putting words in his mouth.\n\nLate Afternoon - April 8, 1433\n\nThe sun is perhaps two hours from setting - you'd estimate it's around the fifth hour after noon (roughly 5 PM in modern reckoning). There's good light remaining, enough to proceed into the city and reach the harbor before dusk if you choose.\n\nThe crusaders have been marching since dawn with a midday rest, covering the final fifteen miles from last night's camp. They're tired but not exhausted - this has been an easy march compared to the campaign. No enemy harassment, good roads, adequate water.\n\nIf you camp outside the city tonight, you'd embark fresh in the morning with full daylight for loading the ships and organizing eight hundred men, horses, baggage, and treasury chests.\n\nIf you proceed to the harbor now, you'd arrive as evening falls, likely embarking tomorrow regardless - but you'd spend tonight in the city rather than in camp."

The CHARACTER_DATABASE shows:\n\n\"Fray Hernando de Talavera\n**Current Location:** Basel, Switzerland (Council of Basel) [REF: Chapter_44.md]\n**Current Task:** Leading Castilian delegation at Council of Basel...\"\n\nSo Juan cannot learn Latin from Fray Hernando during this journey because Fray Hernando isn't with him. I need to point this out.\n\nFor the d100 table on the journey to Rome, this is a CHAOS ROLL (random events, not persuasion). I should create genuine unpredictability with wide variance. This is a sea journey from Málaga to Rome (probably landing at Ostia or Civitavecchia).\n\nHistorical context to consider:\n- Mediterranean shipping in April is good season (spring)\n- Genoese sailors are highly experienced\n- Pirates are a concern (Barbary corsairs, though less active with Granada fallen)\n- Weather can still be unpredictable\n- The journey is probably 7-10 days with good winds\n- 10 ships carrying 800 men plus horses, baggage, treasury\n\nLet me create a realistic d100 table for a Mediterranean sea voyage.\n\nCamp Outside Málaga - Evening of April 8, 1433\n\nThe crusaders establish camp in a broad field north of the city walls. Tents rise in ordered rows. Captain Fernán designates three hundred men who may enter the city in rotating groups - not so many that discipline breaks down, but enough that those who wish can visit taverns, find a bath, or attend evening Mass at the cathedral.\n\nYou send Don Bernat de Centelles and Captain Fernán into the city with an honor guard of twenty crusaders. They'll announce your arrival to the city's governor and the harbor master, confirm arrangements with the Genoese ship captains, and ensure everything is prepared for embarkation at dawn.\n\nRegarding Latin instruction:\n\nThere's a problem. Fray Hernando de Talavera is not with you - he's at Basel leading the Castilian delegation to the Council. He departed for Basel months ago (October 1432) and has been there throughout the winter and spring, serving as your chief representative in those theological and political negotiations.\n\nYou do have five other chaplains with the crusader force - Father Rodrigo, Father Miguel, and three others whose names are recorded in the campaign rolls. Any of them could provide Latin instruction during the journey, though none have Fray Hernando's depth of theological learning or skill as a teacher.\n\nWho would you like to study with during the voyage?\n\nD100 TABLE: MÁLAGA TO ROME SEA VOYAGE\n(Chaos Roll -

It's a rough crossing that tests morale but doesn't cause real harm. Within that range, 33 is on the lower end, so I'll lean toward the more challenging aspects.\n\nFor the Latin study, the player said \"whoever wants to teach\" - I should identify one of the five chaplains who volunteers. Let me pick Father Miguel as a reasonable choice - he's competent but not as skilled as Fray Hernando would be.\n\nNow I need to narrate:\n1. The embarkation at Málaga\n2. The voyage with the difficult conditions\n3. The Latin instruction attempts\n4. Arrival in Rome (delayed)\n\nI should not generate dialogue or actions for Juan. I need to stop and let him respond when appropriate.\n\nLet me calculate the timeline:\n- Normal voyage: 9-10 days\n- With 3-5 days delay: 12-15 days total\n- Departed April 9, arrive April 21-24 (let's say April 23)\n\nEmbarkation - Dawn, April 9, 1433\n\nThe crusaders break camp with practiced efficiency. By the time the sun clears the eastern mountains, the first companies are marching through Málaga's gates toward the harbor. The baggage train follows - forty mules laden with supplies, plus the heavily guarded carts carrying the treasury chests and relic cases.\n\nThe Genoese ships are impressive up close. Ten vessels: six broad-beamed carracks for cargo and troops, four sleeker galleys with banks of oars. The lead carrack flies a banner someone prepared overnight - Castile's lions and castles quartered with a white cross on red field. The harbor master has cleared the central docks for your exclusive use.\n\nLoading eight hundred men, two hundred horses, baggage, and treasure onto ships takes most of the morning. The Genoese captains - experienced professionals - organize it methodically. Horses go into the holds first, secured in specially built stalls. Treasury and relics are placed in the captain's cabin of the lead carrack, under continuous guard. Companies are assigned to specific vessels with their equipment.\n\nFather Miguel, one of your chaplains - a lean Toledan priest of perhaps forty years - approaches as you oversee the loading. \"Your Majesty, I understand you wish to improve your Latin during the voyage. I would be honored to assist, though I confess I lack Fray Hernando's gifts as a teacher.\"\n\nBy early afternoon, the fleet is ready. The Genoese captain - a grizzled sailor named Paolo Grimaldi - gives the order. Sails unfurl. Oars bite into the harbor water. One by one, the ten ships clear the breakwater and turn east-southeast toward Rome.\n\nThe Voyage - April 9-23, 1433\n\nDays 1-3: Promising Start\n\nThe first days go well enough. The coast of Granada and then eastern Iberia slides past to the north. The weather is fair. Many crusaders experience seasickness - even some who fought at Alcalá without flinching turn green and retch over the rails - but this is expected.\n\nFather Miguel sets up a small \"classroom\" on the deck of your carrack. He brings a Latin Psalter and begins working through passages with you, explaining grammar and syntax. You make slow but steady progress, though the rolling deck makes concentration difficult.\n\nDays 4-7: The Weather Turns\n\nAs the fleet passes south of the Balearic Islands, the wind shifts. Captain Grimaldi curses in Genoese and starts barking orders. The sky darkens. By evening of Day 4, the Mediterranean has transformed from azure beauty to gray menace.\n\nThe ships begin to tack - sailing at angles to the contrary wind rather than straight toward Rome. This zigzag pattern is exhausting for the oarsmen and frustrating for everyone. The carrack rises and falls on increasingly choppy seas. Most crusaders are now violently ill. The smell below decks becomes unbearable.\n\nYour Latin lessons with Father Miguel continue sporadically, but between the rough seas and the miserable condition of the troops, it's difficult to maintain focus. The priest himself looks distinctly queasy but gamely continues instruction whenever conditions permit.\n\nDays 8-12: Worst of It\n\nThe contrary winds don't break. Rain lashes the decks. The fleet is forced to shelter at Corsica for two days (Days 9-10) while a particularly fierce storm passes. The crusaders huddle below decks or in whatever shelter they can find, soaked and miserable.\n\nMarco Tornesi, normally unflappable, is seen leaning over the rail looking thoroughly defeated by seasickness. Andrea Vescovi actually manages better than most - his farm-boy constitution serves him well - and helps tend to others.\n\nThe horses panic during the worst of the storm. You can hear them screaming in the hold. Two break legs and must be put down - necessary but grim.\n\nDays 13-14: Final Push\n\nAfter the storm breaks and the fleet leaves Corsica, the winds finally shift favorable. The last two days see good progress. The crusaders begin to recover - those who haven't been sick the entire time help those still struggling. The Italian coast comes into view.\n\nBut you're late. Very late. What should have been a 9-10 day voyage has taken fourteen days.\n\nYour Latin Progress:\n\nFather Miguel did his best, but between the weather, the seasickness (his and yours at times), and the general chaos of the voyage, the instruction was inconsistent. You've learned perhaps twenty new Latin phrases, improved your understanding of some grammatical structures, and can now stumble through a few psalms with only moderate help. It's progress, but modest.\n\nArrival at Ostia - April 23, 1433\n\nThe fleet limps into Ostia harbor - Rome's port city, fifteen miles from the eternal city itself. The crusaders are battered, exhausted, and eager for solid ground. Several men literally kiss the dock when they disembark.\n\nCaptain Grimaldi finds you as the unloading begins. \"Your Majesty, my apologies for the delay. Worst contrary winds I've seen in April in fifteen years at sea. But we're here, and everything important - men, treasury, relics - is intact. Just two horses lost, and those to panic in the storm.\"\n\nThe harbor master - clearly informed of your arrival - approaches with a nervous bow. \"Your Majesty, we... we expected you four days ago. There have been inquiries from Rome. Cardinals asking about the delay. Should I send word immediately that you've arrived?\""

The timeline says:\n- December 18, 1431: Pope dissolved council\n- April 29, 1432: Council summoned Pope (not 1433)\n- May 31, 1433: Sigismund crowned emperor at Rome\n- August 1, 1433: First version of Eugene's recognition signed\n- December 15, 1433: Amended version signed\n\nSo in April 1433, we're RIGHT in the middle of this crisis:\n- The Pope dissolved the council in December 1431\n- The council refused and summoned him in April 1432\n- It's now April 1433\n- Emperor Sigismund was just crowned in Rome on May 31, 1433... wait, that's in the FUTURE from April 23.\n\nLet me check the dates again. May 31, 1433 - that's only 5 weeks in the future. So Sigismund is probably IN ROME RIGHT NOW or arriving very soon for his coronation.\n\n2. **Colonna Family Conflict:**\n   - Pope Eugene took violent measures against the Colonna family (relatives of Pope Martin V) when he became Pope\n   - This involved him in serious conflict with this powerful Roman family\n   - There will be an insurrectionary republic established by the Colonna in May 1434 (future)\n   - But tensions are already high\n\n3. **Papal States Under Invasion:**\n   - Former papal condottiero Niccolò Fortebraccio invading\n   - Troops of Filippo Maria Visconti (Duke of Milan) led by Niccolò Piccinino\n   - This is retaliation for Eugene's support of Florence and Venice against Milan\n   - Wars in Lombardy ongoing\n\n4. **Rome itself:**\n   - Tensions with Colonna family\n   - Pope will be forced to flee Rome in June 1434 (about 13 months in future)\n   - But right now, Pope is still in Rome\n   - Emperor Sigismund about to arrive for coronation (May 31, 1433)\n\nSo the harbor master would know:\n- The Pope is under enormous pressure from the Council of Basel\n- Emperor Sigismund is coming to Rome soon (probably already on his way) for coronation\n- There are military threats to the Papal States from Milan\n- The Colonna family is causing trouble\n- Rome is tense politically\n- Cardinals are divided on the Council issue\n\nThis is a VERY tense moment in church history. Juan is arriving at exactly the right (or wrong?) time - right when Pope Eugenius needs allies and support.\n\nOstia Harbor - April 23, 1433\n\nThe harbor master - a nervous, thin man in his fifties wearing the papal livery - glances anxiously back toward Rome before answering. He lowers his voice slightly, though there's no one close enough to overhear.\n\n\"Your Majesty... the situation in Rome is, shall we say, complicated.\" He pauses, choosing his words carefully. \"His Holiness Pope Eugenius is under considerable pressure. The Council of Basel refuses to dissolve despite His Holiness ordering it so. They have declared themselves superior to the Holy Father and actually summoned him to appear before them like a common priest. Can you imagine?\"\n\nHe shakes his head in evident distress. \"The Emperor Sigismund - may God preserve him - is on his way to Rome even now. He will be crowned Holy Roman Emperor by His Holiness on the thirty-first of May, just five weeks hence. Many hope the Emperor can mediate between His Holiness and the Council. But...\" He trails off meaningfully.\n\n\"There are other troubles as well, Your Majesty. The Duke of Milan's condottieri - Niccolò Piccinino - is making war in the Papal States. Fortebraccio's mercenaries as well. They're angry that His Holiness supports Florence and Venice against Milan. And here in Rome itself...\" He looks around again. \"The Colonna family. They were close to Pope Martin - God rest his soul - and His Holiness Pope Eugenius demanded they return lands and castles when he took office. The family is... displeased. There are tensions in the city.\"\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles, who has been listening, interjects quietly. \"Is the Holy Father in actual danger?\"\n\nThe harbor master hesitates. \"Not immediate danger, no. But Rome is not the peaceful city it should be. Cardinals are divided on the Council question. Some support His Holiness, others think he should submit to Basel. The streets... well, there are factions. Arguments in taverns turn to brawls. The Colonna have many supporters among the Roman nobility.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"Your Majesty, forgive my boldness, but your arrival may be... providential. A king who completed the Reconquista, coming to return sacred relics and a crusade treasury? His Holiness needs allies right now. Cardinals who might waver on Basel, nobles who support the Colonna - they will all take note when eight hundred crusaders march through Rome carrying the True Cross.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán has joined you and caught the last part. He glances at you, then at the harbor master. \"Is the road to Rome safe for such a march? Or should we expect... difficulties?\""

          "text": "1. **April 1433 situation**: Emperor Sigismund is about to arrive in Rome (will be crowned May 31, 1433). The compromise between Pope and Council hasn't been fully resolved yet - that happens December 15, 1433. \n\n2. **The Colonna situation**: Pope Eugenius took harsh measures against the Colonna family (demanded return of lands/castles given by Martin V). This created serious tensions. However, the actual \"insurrectionary republic\" controlled by the Colonna doesn't happen until **May-June 1434** - over a year from now.\n\n3. **Current control (April 1433)**: The Pope still controls Rome. He's under pressure, there are tensions, the Colonna are angry, but he hasn't been driven out yet. That happens in 1434.\n\n4. **The mercenary invasions**: Piccinino and Fortebraccio are making war in the Papal States (the broader territories), but they haven't reached Rome itself yet in April 1433.\n\n5. **Security assessment for Juan's march**: \n   - The Pope controls the gates\n   - Rome is tense but not in open rebellion\n   - The road from Ostia to Rome (15 miles) is relatively safe - it's the main supply route\n   - Juan arriving with 800 crusaders is actually a security asset for the Pope\n   - Some tension/incidents possible, but nothing that would prevent the march\n\nSo the answer is: Yes, Pope controls the gates. The march should be possible but there may be some tension/hostility from Colonna supporters in the streets. Not dangerous for 800 armed crusaders, but not entirely welcoming either.\n\nThe harbor master exchanges a quick glance with Don Bernat, then nods slowly.\n\n\"His Holiness still controls the gates, yes. Rome has not fallen into open rebellion - not yet, at least. The city guard remains loyal to the Holy Father, and the major fortifications are held by papal troops. The Colonna have their palaces and their armed men, but they have not moved against His Holiness directly.\"\n\nHe pauses, clearly weighing his words. \"The road from Ostia to Rome is safe enough. Fifteen miles, well-traveled, no bandits this close to the city. Your eight hundred armed crusaders...\" He allows himself a slight smile. \"...I doubt anyone would be foolish enough to interfere with such a force.\"\n\n\"However,\" he continues more seriously, \"once you enter Rome itself, the situation becomes more delicate. The streets are another matter. The Colonna have many supporters - Roman nobles, their retainers, common folk who benefited from their patronage under Pope Martin. When they see crusaders marching to support Pope Eugenius, there may be... words. Perhaps stones thrown from windows, insults shouted. Nothing that threatens your safety with so many armed men, but neither will it be the triumphal procession that welcomed Pope Martin after the Great Schism ended.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán crosses his arms. \"Words and stones we can handle. We've marched through conquered Granada. A few angry Romans won't stop us.\"\n\nDon Bernat adds thoughtfully, \"His Holiness will want to receive you formally. Likely at the Lateran Palace or St. Peter's. Such a public arrival of the Reconquista King with sacred relics - it strengthens his position enormously. The cardinals who support Basel's claims to supremacy will find it harder to argue the Holy Father lacks divine favor when you kneel before him carrying the True Cross and a crusade treasury.\"\n\nThe harbor master nods vigorously. \"Precisely, Your Majesty. Your arrival is a gift to His Holiness at a critical moment. I should send word immediately that you've arrived. Where would you prefer to make camp tonight - here at Ostia, or should I arrange accommodations in Rome itself?\""

We'll keep discipline, show respect, but we'll be ready.\"\n\nMarco Tornesi, the former Genoese mercenary, adds quietly: \"I fought in Italy before joining the crusade. Roman mobs can be... unpredictable. But they respect strength. Eight hundred armed men marching in formation - that's a language everyone understands.\"\n\nFather Miguel crosses himself. \"We carry the True Cross. Whatever happens, God's hand is in this. I'll make sure the men understand - we're guests, yes, but we're also witnesses. The Holy Father needs to see that Castile stands with him.\"\n\nBy evening, the crusaders have disembarked. The horses are watered and fed. The treasury chests and relic cases are secured under triple guard. The men eat a simple meal, check their equipment one final time, and settle in for a few hours of rest.\n\nTomorrow morning, you'll march to Rome.\n\nD100 TABLE: OSTIA TO ROME MARCH\n(Chaos Roll - External Forces & Random Events)\n\n1-3: COLONNA AMBUSH ATTEMPT\n\nColonna family decides to make statement against foreign interference\n\n200+ armed retainers attempt to block road at narrow point\n\nThey don't realize how many crusaders there are until too late\n\nBrief, violent clash: 12-18 crusaders killed, 30-40 wounded\n\nColonna forces routed: 40-60 killed, many flee\n\nCreates immediate crisis: you've shed Roman blood before reaching the city\n\nColonna family demands justice, Pope Eugenius caught between supporting you and avoiding civil war\n\nEmperor Sigismund's arrival (May 31) becomes even more critical\n\nYour arrival becomes controversial rather than triumphant\n\n4-8: HOSTILE MOB CONFRONTATION\n\nPro-Colonna/anti-foreign mob (300-500 people) blocks road outside Rome\n\nAngry about \"Spanish interference\" in Roman affairs\n\nThrow stones, shout insults, brandish clubs\n\nNo organized attack but serious threat of violence\n\nCrusaders forced to halt, form defensive positions\n\nStandoff lasts 2-3 hours until papal troops arrive to disperse mob\n\n3-6 crusaders injured by stones\n\nSeveral Romans injured/killed when mob gets too aggressive and crusaders respond\n\nArrival delayed by half a day\n\nCreates tense atmosphere for your meeting with Pope\n\n9-15: COLD RECEPTION\n\nMarch proceeds without violence but Romans are notably unwelcoming\n\nStreets empty as you pass -

          "text": "This means:\n- Clear factional divide visible as they march\n- Some quarters (papal supporters): Cheering, flowers, people kneeling as relics pass\n- Other quarters (Colonna/Basel supporters): Silence, shuttered windows, occasional insults\n- A few stones thrown from windows in hostile quarters, no serious injuries\n- Gives visceral sense of how divided Rome actually is\n- Cardinals watching from various positions, taking notes\n- Emperor Sigismund's representatives observe and report\n- Your arrival becomes rallying point for both factions\n\nThis is a realistic middle-ground outcome. Rome is clearly divided, Juan gets to see this firsthand, but there's no major violence or disaster. It sets up the complexity of the situation he's walking into.\n\nI should narrate:\n1. The departure from Ostia at dawn\n2. The 15-mile march to Rome\n3. The changing atmosphere as they approach and enter the city\n4. The visible factional divide\n5. Various incidents showing both support and hostility\n6. Arrival at the gates/Vatican area\n\nI need to make this vivid and show the political reality through concrete sensory details. Don't just tell - show through what Juan sees, hears, and experiences.\n\nRemember: NEVER generate dialogue or actions for Juan. Stop when it's time for him to make decisions or respond.\n\nThe March to Rome - Dawn, April 24, 1433\n\nThe crusaders form up as the sun rises over Ostia. Eight hundred men in white tabards, pikes and spears at the ready, crossbows slung across backs. The Guardian Company surrounds the carts carrying the treasury chests and relic cases. Captain Fernán positions mounted sergeants as outriders. The column stretches nearly half a mile.\n\nThe Via Ostiensis - the ancient Roman road connecting the port to the eternal city - runs straight and true. Fifteen miles of paved stone, worn smooth by centuries of feet, hooves, and wheels. The morning is cool, the sky clear. To the north, you can see Rome in the distance: a sprawl of red tile roofs, church towers, and ancient ruins dominated by the massive bulk of St. Peter's Basilica.\n\nThe first few miles are quiet. Farmers in their fields stop work to watch you pass. A few merchants on the road pull their carts aside, staring at the white banner with its red cross. One old man crosses himself and mutters something in Italian you don't catch.\n\nApproaching Rome - Mid-Morning\n\nAs you draw closer to the city, the character of the road changes. More traffic: pilgrims, merchants, nobles' carriages. Word of your approach has spread. People line the roadside now, watching. Some kneel as the relic cases pass. Others simply stare.\n\nThen you notice it: the division.\n\nA group of perhaps forty people - well-dressed, clearly Roman nobility or wealthy merchants - stand beneath a Colonna family banner near a crossroads. They watch you pass in complete silence. No insults, no stones, but the hostility is palpable. Arms crossed. Faces hard. One young noble spits deliberately on the ground as you ride by.\n\nTwo hundred yards further, a completely different scene: a small church with perhaps sixty people gathered outside - clerics, monks, common folk. They wave, call out blessings in Italian and Latin. An elderly priest holds up a crucifix, tears streaming down his face. \"Deus Vult!\" they shout. \"Viva il Papa!\"\n\nMarco Tornesi rides up beside Captain Fernán. \"Like I said - divided city. Those Colonna supporters? They're not going to cheer for anyone who strengthens the Pope.\"\n\nEntering Rome - The Porta San Paolo\n\nThe ancient gate looms ahead - massive stone archway that has stood for over a thousand years. Papal guards in their livery stand at attention. An official in rich robes - clearly a papal administrator - waits with a small escort.\n\nHe bows deeply as you approach. \"Your Majesty, King Juan II of Castile. His Holiness Pope Eugenius IV bids you welcome to the eternal city. I am Cardinal Orsini's secretary. His Eminence awaits you at St. Peter's.\"\n\nThe guards open the gates wide. You enter Rome.\n\nInside the City - The Divided Streets\n\nThe first quarter you pass through - Trastevere - erupts in cheers. The streets are packed. People hanging from windows, crowding doorways, lining the narrow streets. Flowers rain down from balconies. Old women weep. Young men shout \"Christus Vincit!\" Children run alongside the column trying to touch the crusaders' white tabards.\n\nA group of Franciscan friars kneels in the street as the Guardian Company passes with the relic cases. The sight of the True Cross's container - even sealed in its wooden case - draws gasps and spontaneous prayers. Giovanni Rossi, carrying the white banner at the column's head, his scarred face streaming with tears, begins singing the Te Deum. Hundreds of Roman voices join him.\n\nThen you cross a bridge over the Tiber and the atmosphere changes completely.\n\nThis quarter - clearly Colonna territory - is silent. Shops are shuttered. Windows are closed despite the warm spring day. The streets aren't empty - people watch from doorways and corners - but no one cheers. A few Colonna retainers in their livery stand in groups, hands on sword hilts, faces hostile.\n\nCrack! A stone hits the cobblestones near the column. Then another. Nothing large enough to really injure anyone in armor, but the message is clear: You're not welcome here.\n\nCaptain Fernán's hand goes to his sword. The crusaders tighten formation. But the stone-throwing stops - whoever threw them doesn't want open confrontation, just wants to make their position known.\n\nYou pass through without incident, though the tension is thick enough to cut.\n\nApproaching St. Peter's - Late Morning\n\nAs you near the Vatican, the character changes again. This is the heart of papal Rome. Cardinals' palaces, churches, monasteries. The streets here are packed - thousands of people have gathered to witness your arrival.\n\nThe reception is warm but not ecstatic. Respectful more than enthusiastic. People cross themselves, bow their heads, watch intently. Cardinals and bishops watch from balconies and windows. You can see them taking mental notes, assessing what your arrival means for the delicate political balance.\n\nA group of perhaps two dozen cardinals in their red robes waits at the steps of St. Peter's. Cardinal Giordano Orsini stands at their head - you recognize him from your meeting with Pope Martin three years ago. He's aged visibly, his face more lined, but his eyes are sharp.\n\nBehind them, at the top of the great steps, you can see Pope Eugenius IV himself. Tall, thin, wearing the papal tiara and white robes. He's flanked by more cardinals and papal officials.\n\nThe column halts in the vast plaza before St. Peter's. The crusaders form orderly ranks. Captain Fernán dismounts, as do the other mounted officers. The Guardian Company carefully carries the relic cases and begins bringing them forward.\n\nCardinal Orsini descends the steps toward you, speaking in fluent Castilian. \"Your Majesty. Welcome to Rome. You arrive at a... complicated moment. His Holiness will receive you formally, but first...\" He lowers his voice slightly. \"The divisions you saw in the streets - they are real. The Colonna family controls perhaps a third of the city's military strength. The Council of Basel has supporters even among the cardinals here. Your arrival is both blessing and complication. Some see it as foreign interference in Roman affairs. Others see it as divine providence.\"\n\nHe glances back at Pope Eugenius, then at you. \"His Holiness needs allies. But he also needs to manage the delicate balance with the Colonna and the Basel faction. Whatever you do here will have consequences.\"\n\nThe plaza is silent. Thousands of eyes are on you. Pope Eugenius waits at the top of the steps. The True Cross and Santiago's bone - the sacred relics you've carried across the Mediterranean - sit in their cases, ready to be presented."

I should describe the preparations and the approach, then stop when they're about to begin the actual audience.\n\nSt. Peter's Plaza - Late Morning, April 24, 1433\n\nCaptain Fernán immediately begins organizing the presentation. The Guardian Company brings forward the items with reverent care:\n\nThe Sacred Relics:\n\nThe gold reliquary containing the fragment of the True Cross, sealed and wrapped in white silk\n\nThe silver reliquary holding Santiago's bone, similarly protected\n\nBoth carried by Sergeant García and Corporal Rodrigo, who have guarded them since Barcelona\n\nThe Documents:\n\nThe original crusade bull Inter Cetera Divinae in its sealed case - the parchment Pope Martin V granted you in July 1430\n\nSultan Yusuf IV's formal renunciation document, signed November 16, 1432, with his seal intact\n\nArchbishop Alonso de Toledo's written statement on Granada's systematic Christianization (20-30 year timeline), sealed with his episcopal seal\n\nThe Banner:\n\nThe white banner with red cross that has flown over every battle and siege - AlcalÃ¡, Loja, MÃ¡laga, Ronda, Granada itself\n\nSlightly worn, stained with campaign dust, but the cross still brilliant red\n\nThe Treasury and Accounting:\n\nThree iron-bound chests containing approximately 315,500 florins\n\nThe complete 47-page accounting prepared by Father Tommaso Parentucelli and Álvaro de Luna\n\nEvery florin documented: income sources, expenditures, remaining balance\n\nThe stipulation clearly written: funds to be used for crusading purposes, not papal personal expenses\n\nYour commanders gather: Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles, Marco Tornesi, Andrea Vescovi (the first crusader sworn), Giovanni Rossi (the one-handed blacksmith), Brother Guillem, Father Miguel, and several other company captains. Fifteen men total - enough to show the crusade's character without overwhelming the audience.\n\nThe rest of the crusaders remain in formation in the plaza. Don Bernat de Centelles positions himself with your party - as Alfonso V's ambassador, his presence at this meeting is both diplomatic courtesy and strategic necessity.\n\nCardinal Orsini watches the preparations with evident approval. \"His Holiness will be moved by this,\" he says quietly. \"We've had many visitors promising support. You're the first to arrive bearing both sacred relics and a completed crusade.\"\n\nHe gestures toward the steps. \"When you're ready, Your Majesty. His Holiness awaits.\"\n\nThe great steps of St. Peter's rise before you - the same steps countless pilgrims have climbed for centuries. At the top, Pope Eugenius IV stands flanked by perhaps thirty cardinals in their red robes. The morning sun illuminates the scene. Thousands of Romans watch from the plaza and surrounding buildings.\n\nYour commanders fall in behind you, carrying the relics, documents, banner, and treasure. The ascent begins.\n\nAs you climb, you can see Pope Eugenius more clearly. He's tall and thin as reported, perhaps fifty years old, with an ascetic face. His expression is complex - hope, wariness, exhaustion, and something else. Relief, perhaps. The besieged pope watching reinforcements arrive.\n\nCardinal Orsini ascends beside you, murmuring protocol: \"His Holiness will greet you formally. Present the relics first, then the documents, then the treasury. He may speak immediately, or he may gesture for private audience afterward. Follow his lead.\"\n\nYou reach the top of the steps. The cardinals part slightly, creating a path. Pope Eugenius IV steps forward.\n\nHis voice carries across the plaza - stronger than you expected from such a thin frame: \"Juan II, King of Castile and León, Conqueror of Granada, you are most welcome to Rome.\"\n\nHe extends his hand bearing the Fisherman's Ring."

The Pope invites private discussion of petitions regarding the Military Orders, Alfonso's Naples claim, and the Basel situation.

His eyes move from you to the items laid out: the reliquaries, the documents, the iron-bound chests, the battle-worn banner. The cardinals watch in silence. Thousands of Romans in the plaza below hold their breath.\n\nD100 TABLE: POPE EUGENIUS IV'S REACTION TO JUAN'S PRESENTATION\n(Persuasion Roll - How Does This Approach Land?)\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (Present at All Roll Levels):\n\nJuan completed the Reconquista - unprecedented achievement\n\nReturns sacred relics in perfect condition\n\nReturns entire crusade treasury (~315,500 florins) with full accounting\n\nStipulation shows honor: funds for crusading, not papal personal use\n\n800 crusaders as visible proof of success\n\nSultan's formal surrender document\n\nArchbishop's 20-30 year conversion plan shows serious mission\n\nPerfect submission and humility in approach\n\nArrival strengthens Pope's position against Basel and Colonna\n\nTiming providential - Pope desperately needs allies\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (Present at All Roll Levels):\n\nPope under enormous political pressure from multiple factions\n\nColonna supporters watching, will interpret papal response politically\n\nBasel Council supporters suspicious of \"foreign interference\"\n\nSome cardinals wary of Pope appearing dependent on foreign king\n\nEmperor Sigismund arriving May 31 - imperial politics matter\n\nPope's personality: cautious after past mistakes, \"vacillating in action\"\n\nStipulation on funds (while honorable) limits Pope's financial flexibility\n\nAny strong papal support creates obligations and complications\n\n1-8: POLITICAL CAUTION DOMINATES\n\nSuccess factors acknowledged but Pope's response extremely guarded:\n\nPope Eugenius speaks carefully, voice formal: \"Your Majesty's achievement honors the Church. The completion of the Reconquista is extraordinary - a work seven centuries in the making. The return of the sacred relics and treasury speaks to your fidelity.\"\n\nHe pauses, glancing at the cardinals - particularly those known to support Basel or have Colonna sympathies.\n\n\"However, these are complex times. The Council of Basel deliberates on matters of supreme authority. Emperor Sigismund arrives soon to mediate. The faithful of Rome have... differing views on many questions.\" His tone is diplomatic but distant. \"Your crusade oath is fulfilled, certainly. The Church releases you from your obligation. We thank you for your service.\"\n\nWhat this means:\n\nCold, formal reception despite extraordinary achievement\n\nNo private audience offered immediately\n\nNo discussion of your petitions (Military Orders, Naples advocacy)\n\nPope treating this as protocol fulfillment, not strategic alliance\n\nCardinals note Pope's caution - both Basel supporters (pleased) and papal supporters (disappointed)\n\nColonna faction relaxes - no sign of strong papal-Castilian alliance\n\nYou're diplomatically thanked and... dismissed\n\nWill take significant additional effort to get real papal support\n\nWhy low roll produces this:\n\nFailure factors dominate Pope's thinking\n\nHis caution and political fears override gratitude\n\nHe sees complications more than opportunities\n\nYour success is acknowledged but not embraced\n\n9-20: GRATEFUL BUT GUARDED\n\nSuccess factors acknowledged, Pope personally moved but politically constrained:\n\nPope Eugenius's voice softens slightly: \"King Juan, you have accomplished what your fathers and grandfathers could not. Seven hundred years... ended in your reign. The Church is grateful.\"\n\nHe gestures to the relics. \"The True Cross returns to Rome. Santiago's bone, carried through battles we can only imagine.\" There's genuine emotion in his voice now. \"Your fidelity to your crusade oath honors both Castile and the Church.\"\n\nHe glances at the cardinals again, then back to you. \"Your crusade service is completed. The Church releases you from your oath with gratitude and blessing. We would hear more of your campaign - though perhaps in private audience would be more appropriate than this public forum?\"\n\nWhat this means:\n\nWarmer than 1-8 but still restrained\n\nOffers private audience (positive sign)\n\nDoesn't commit to anything publicly\n\nPersonal gratitude visible but political calculations dominant\n\nBasel supporters note Pope's restraint with approval\n\nPapal supporters hope private audience will be more substantial\n\nColonna faction watching carefully\n\nOpens door for you to pursue petitions privately\n\nBut no strong public endorsement or alliance\n\nWhy this range:\n\nSuccess factors resonate personally with Pope\n\nBut failure factors prevent bold response\n\nHe wants to avoid appearing dependent or taking strong sides\n\nCompromise: acknowledge privately what he can't embrace publicly\n\n21-35: MOVED BUT CAUTIOUS\n\nSuccess factors creating genuine emotional response, failure factors preventing full embrace:\n\nPope Eugenius steps forward, and you see tears forming in his eyes. \"Your Majesty...\" His voice breaks slightly. \"Pope Martin sent you to Granada three years ago. He wept when you offered everything to God. He did not live to see this day.\"\n\nHe looks at the relics, the treasury, the documents. \"You have done what seemed impossible. The Reconquista is complete. You return what was lent, with accounting, with proof, with honor.\"\n\nHe raises his voice so the plaza can hear: \"The Church releases King Juan II of Castile from his crusade oath. His service is fulfilled with honor and glory. Let it be recorded that Castile kept faith.\"\n\nThen, more quietly: \"We must speak privately. There is much to discuss. The Council of Basel, the situation in Rome, your petitions... these matters require careful consideration. But know this: you have strengthened the Church in our hour of need, whether you intended to or not.\"\n\nWhat this means:\n\nPope personally and genuinely moved\n\nPublic release from oath with some warmth\n\nPrivate audience clearly offered\n\nBut still no strong public commitments\n\nLeaves room for petitions to be discussed privately\n\nBasel supporters concerned but not alarmed\n\nPapal supporters encouraged - this could develop into real alliance\n\nColonna faction wary but not hostile\n\nYou've made positive impression but must build on it carefully\n\n36-50: DEEPLY GRATEFUL, POLITICALLY AWARE\n\nSuccess factors resonating strongly, Pope balancing gratitude with political reality:\n\nPope Eugenius embraces you after you kiss his ring - an unusually personal gesture. \"Juan of Castile. The young king who knelt naked before Pope Martin, offering everything. And now... you return bearing proof of miracles.\"\n\nHe turns to address the cardinals and crowd: \"Let all witness: this king completed the Reconquista. Seven centuries of struggle, ended. He returns the sacred relics entrusted to him. He returns the crusade treasury with full accounting.\" His voice strengthens. \"This is what fidelity looks like. This is what crusade authority, properly granted, can accomplish.\"\n\nTo you, more quietly: \"Your crusade oath is fulfilled. But I sense you did not travel from Granada merely to be released. We have much to discuss - your petitions regarding the Military Orders, the situation with King Alfonso and Naples, the Council of Basel's implications for all Christian monarchs.\"\n\nHe glances at the treasury chests. \"The stipulation you've placed on these funds - for crusading purposes - shows wisdom. These are not quiet times. The Turks threaten Constantinople. The Church faces internal division. Perhaps... perhaps your crusade is not truly finished?\"\n\nWhat this means:\n\nPope publicly endorsing your achievement\n\nUsing your success to make point about papal authority (subtle dig at Basel)\n\nPrivate discussions clearly opening\n\nHints at wanting continued alliance\n\nPetitions will be seriously considered\n\nBasel supporters unhappy - Pope using foreign king to strengthen position\n\nPapal supporters encouraged - real alliance forming\n\nSets foundation for substantive negotiations\n\n51-65: PROVIDENTIAL TIMING\n\nSuccess factors seen as divine providence, Pope recognizing strategic opportunity:\n\nPope Eugenius takes both your hands, pulling you to your feet. His thin face is wet with tears. \"Do you know what day this is? April twenty-fourth. The feast of St. Fidelis - the patron saint of fidelity.\"\n\nHe turns to the assembled cardinals, voice ringing across the plaza: \"Three years ago, Pope Martin granted this young king authority to crusade against Granada. Some questioned the wisdom. Some doubted his age, his experience. Pope Martin wept at his humility and trusted God's providence.\"\n\nHe gestures to the items. \"Behold the fruit of that trust. The Reconquista is complete. The relics return. The treasury returns with accounting so thorough it would satisfy any merchant. And...\" he picks up the Sultan's surrender document, \"...the Emirate of Granada, which threatened Christendom for seven centuries, is Christian.\"\n\nTo you directly: \"Your crusade oath is fulfilled with such honor that it shames those who doubt what crusaders can accomplish when properly led. We release you from your oath - but we hope your service to the Church is not finished. Come. We have much to discuss privately. The Council of Basel must see what papal authority, rightly exercised, can accomplish.\"\n\nWhat this means:\n\nPope publicly and strongly endorsing you\n\nUsing your success as argument against Basel's claims\n\nAlliance forming visibly\n\nYour petitions likely to receive favorable consideration\n\nBasel supporters alarmed - this is exactly what they feared\n\nColonna faction concerned - Pope gaining powerful ally\n\nEmperor Sigismund's representatives taking notes\n\nYou've significantly strengthened Pope's position\n\nBut also made yourself controversial figure in Roman politics\n\n66-78: DIVINE VINDICATION\n\nSuccess factors seen as divine judgment on papal-conciliar conflict:\n\nPope Eugenius's voice breaks with emotion: \"When the Council of Basel declared themselves superior to Peter's throne... when they summoned me to appear before them like a common priest... I prayed for a sign. I asked God: 'Have I erred? Should I submit to the Council's claims?'\"\n\nHe looks at you, then at the relics. \"And now you arrive. The king who knelt naked before Pope Martin, offering everything. Who received papal authority to crusade. Who completed the impossible. Who returns not just relics and gold, but proof that when the Church acts through Peter's successor, God grants victory.\"\n\nHe raises his voice: \"The Council of Basel claims supreme authority over the Pope. But tell me - did the Council of Basel conquer Granada? Did their decrees end the Reconquista? Or did papal authority, granted to a faithful king, accomplish in three years what seven centuries could not?\"\n\nThe crowd erupts in cheers. Several cardinals look deeply uncomfortable. Cardinal Orsini is weeping openly.\n\nPope Eugenius embraces you. \"Your crusade oath is fulfilled beyond all expectation. Come, we must speak privately. You have given me more than relics and gold - you have given me clarity. God has not abandoned Peter's throne.\"\n\nWhat this means:\n\nPope publicly using your success in papal-conciliar conflict\n\nStrong alliance forming immediately\n\nYour petitions almost certainly granted\n\nBasel supporters furious - this is dangerous to their position\n\nColonna faction alarmed - Pope emboldened\n\nPapal supporters jubilant\n\nThis is now a major political event, not just ceremonial\n\nYour presence becomes central to Roman politics\n\nEmperor Sigismund will need to account for this when mediating\n\n79-88: TRANSFORMATION\n\nSuccess factors create profound personal and political shift in Pope:\n\nPope Eugenius falls to his knees before you - shocking the assembled cardinals. \"Forgive me, Your Majesty. Not for any offense against you, but... I have doubted. When Basel declared themselves supreme, when the Colonna turned against me, when even cardinals questioned my decisions... I doubted whether I had erred in resisting the Council.\"\n\nHe stands, tears streaming. \"But you kneel before me carrying the True Cross. You return the crusade treasury with honor. You completed the Reconquista under papal authority. This is God's answer to my doubts.\"\n\nHe turns to the cardinals, voice trembling with conviction: \"The Council of Basel claims authority over the Pope. Let them see what papal authority, rightly exercised, accomplishes. Let them explain why their decrees and debates have not achieved what this king's crusade - launched under papal bull - has achieved.\"\n\nTo you: \"Your oath is fulfilled. But I beg you - as Peter begged Christ - stay with us in our hour of trial. Your presence here, your witness, your strength... Rome needs this. The Church needs this. I need this.\"\n\nHe embraces you. \"Whatever petitions you bring, consider them granted. Military Orders? They should belong to the crown that completed the Reconquista. Alfonso's claim to Naples? We will support it. The Church owes Castile a debt that cannot be repaid.\"\n\nWhat this means:\n\nPope experiencing profound spiritual/political transformation\n\nImmediate strong alliance formed\n\nYour petitions granted essentially on the spot\n\nBasel faction in crisis - their position severely weakened\n\nColonna family must recalculate - Pope has powerful ally\n\nPapal supporters triumphant but concerned about confrontation\n\nYou're now central figure in Roman politics whether you wanted to be or not\n\nEmperor Sigismund's mediation just became more complex\n\nChurch politics fundamentally shifted by your arrival\n\n89-95: LEGENDARY MOMENT\n\nSuccess factors creating historical turning point:\n\nAs Pope Eugenius reaches to take your hands, Cardinal Orsini suddenly cries out: \"Your Holiness! The sun!\"\n\nEveryone looks up. A break in the morning clouds has created a single shaft of brilliant sunlight illuminating you, the Pope, and the sacred relics on the steps. The effect is stunning - like a stage lit by divine hand.\n\nThe crowd in the plaza gasps. Several cardinals fall to their knees. Pope Eugenius stands transfixed, staring at the light.\n\nWhen he speaks, his voice carries across the silent plaza: \"Pope Martin sent you to conquer Granada. You returned the Reconquista to God. You kneel before Peter's throne with proof of what faith can accomplish.\"\n\nHe raises the gold reliquary containing the True Cross fragment, and the sunlight seems to intensify. \"Let all witness: when the Church acts through Peter's successor, when kings submit to papal authority with pure hearts, when crusades are launched in true faith... God grants victory.\"\n\nHis voice breaks: \"The Council of Basel says councils are supreme over popes. The Colonna say Rome should govern Rome. The Milanese invade. The fractious divide us.\" He looks at you. \"And in our darkest hour, a king arrives bearing the True Cross and proof that papal authority, rightly used, can move mountains.\"\n\nTo the cardinals: \"This is our answer to Basel. This is God's judgment on their claims.\"\n\nTo you: \"Whatever you ask, it is granted. Stay with us. Help us navigate these troubled waters. Your witness - your very presence - is a gift from God.\"\n\nWhat this means:\n\nMiraculous timing creates legendary moment\n\nChronicles will write about this for centuries\n\nBasel faction's position severely damaged\n\nPope's authority dramatically strengthened\n\nAll petitions granted immediately\n\nStrong Castilian-papal alliance formed\n\nBut also: you're now deeply involved in Church politics\n\nColonna and other factions will treat you as threat\n\nEmperor's mediation complicated but your presence may actually help\n\nRome's political balance fundamentally shifted\n\n96-100: ACTS OF GOD - HISTORICAL WATERSHED\n\nEverything from 89-95, plus:\n\nAs the sunlight illuminates the scene, the bells of St. Peter's begin ringing - and then, one by one, every church bell in Rome joins. No one rang them. The bell-ringers later report the same thing: \"I felt compelled.\"\n\nThe crowd in the plaza falls to its knees. Cardinals on the steps do the same - even those who support Basel or the Colonna. The sound is overwhelming - dozens of bells across the eternal city ringing in spontaneous harmony.\n\nPope Eugenius is weeping uncontrollably. \"Martin... Pope Martin, if you can see this from Heaven... you were right. You were right to trust him. You were right to grant the crusade authority. God has vindicated your judgment.\"\n\nHe takes the True Cross reliquary in trembling hands, raises it high. The bells continue. The sunlight continues. The entire plaza seems to vibrate with sacred significance.\n\n\"This is not politics,\" he says, voice breaking. \"This is not about Basel or Colonna or Milan. This is God speaking. When we doubted, when we wavered, when we questioned whether Peter's throne still held divine favor... God sent us a sign we cannot ignore.\"\n\nHe turns to the cardinals - all kneeling now, even the Basel supporters. \"The Council of Basel is not wrong to call for reform. But they are wrong to claim supremacy over Peter's throne. This king, this crusade, this moment - they prove it. Papal authority, rightly exercised with humble hearts, accomplishes God's will.\"\n\nLater that day, three cardinals who supported Basel publicly renounce their position. The Colonna patriarch requests urgent private audience with the Pope - not to threaten, but to seek reconciliation. Word spreads through Rome like wildfire.\n\nEmperor Sigismund, hearing reports from his advance representatives, sends urgent message: \"I come to Rome to mediate. But perhaps God has already rendered judgment.\"\n\nYour arrival becomes watershed moment in the papal-conciliar crisis. The Church will debate its meaning for decades, but in Rome on April 24, 1433, everyone present understands they witnessed something extraordinary.\n\nWhen you're ready, I'll roll for Pope Eugenius IV's reaction."

          "text": "Roll of 50 falls in the \"36-50: DEEPLY GRATEFUL, POLITICALLY AWARE\" range.\n\nSuccess factors resonating strongly, Pope balancing gratitude with political reality. He's personally moved, publicly endorses Juan, opens door for private discussions about petitions, hints at wanting continued alliance. Uses Juan's success to make subtle point about papal authority. Basel supporters are unhappy but not in crisis. Sets foundation for substantive negotiations.\n\nThis is a good result - not miraculous, but solid. The Pope is genuinely grateful and sees the strategic value, but he's still navigating complex political waters. He'll be warm and welcoming, make a strong public statement, and clearly invite private discussion of the serious matters (Military Orders, Naples, Basel situation).\n\nI need to remember:\n1. Never generate dialogue for Juan\n2. Stop when Juan needs to respond\n3. Show the Pope's personality: personally moved but politically cautious, balancing gratitude with awareness of Basel/Colonna pressures\n4. This is setting up for private negotiations later\n5. The result should feel earned but not miraculous\n\nSt. Peter's Steps - Late Morning, April 24, 1433\n\nPope Eugenius IV stands silent for a long moment, his eyes moving from the reliquaries to the documents to the iron-bound chests. His thin face works with emotion - you can see him struggling to compose himself.\n\nThen he steps forward and embraces you - pulling you to your feet if you're still kneeling. It's an unusually personal gesture for such a public moment. Several cardinals exchange glances.\n\nWhen he speaks, his voice carries across the plaza, stronger than you'd expected from such an ascetic frame:\n\n\"Juan of Castile. Three years ago, you knelt before Pope Martin in this very city. You offered everything to God - stripped naked before the Vicar of Christ, holding nothing back. Pope Martin wept that day. He granted you authority to crusade against Granada, and he wept because he saw something in you that moved him deeply.\"\n\nThe Pope's voice breaks slightly. \"He did not live to see this day. But if he watches from Heaven, he sees his judgment vindicated.\"\n\nHe turns to address the assembled cardinals and the crowd: \"Let all witness what stands before us. The Reconquista - seven centuries of struggle - is complete. The sacred relics entrusted to this king return to Rome. The crusade treasury returns with accounting so thorough...\" he picks up the bound ledger, \"...that it would satisfy the most demanding merchant in Christendom.\"\n\nHe holds up Sultan Yusuf IV's surrender document, the seal clearly visible. \"The Emirate of Granada, which threatened Christian Europe since the eighth century, has surrendered. Its capital flies the cross of Christ. Its people are being brought to the true faith.\"\n\nHis voice strengthens, and now there's steel in it: \"This is what papal authority, rightly exercised and faithfully obeyed, can accomplish. When the Church acts through Peter's successor with pure intention, when Christian kings submit to that authority with humble hearts, God grants victory.\"\n\nSeveral cardinals who you'd guess support Basel look distinctly uncomfortable. Cardinal Orsini is openly weeping. The crowd in the plaza erupts in cheers - \"Deus Vult! Christus Vincit!\"\n\nPope Eugenius lets the moment settle, then continues more quietly - though still audible to those on the steps: \"King Juan, your crusade oath is fulfilled. The Church releases you from your obligation with honor, with gratitude, and with blessing. Castile has kept faith. You have kept faith.\"\n\nHe pauses, glancing at the cardinals, then back to you. \"But I sense you did not travel from Granada merely to be released from an oath. The items you bring, the witnesses who accompany you, the timing of your arrival...\" His eyes are sharp despite the tears. \"We have much to discuss, you and I. Matters that require careful consideration and private counsel.\"\n\nHe raises his voice again: \"Let it be proclaimed throughout Christendom: the Reconquista is complete. King Juan II of Castile has fulfilled his crusade oath with such honor that it stands as witness to all Christian monarchs of what can be accomplished when papal authority and royal fidelity work in harmony.\"\n\nThe political message is subtle but clear - and the Basel-supporting cardinals don't miss it. This isn't just about Granada. This is about the ongoing struggle over supreme authority in the Church.\n\nPope Eugenius turns back to you, his voice now personal and warm: \"Your commanders - these men who carried the True Cross through battles - they honor you by their presence. We would speak with you privately, but first...\" He looks at the crusaders still standing in formation in the plaza below. \"These men deserve the Church's blessing for their service.\"\n\nHe raises his hands toward the eight hundred crusaders. \"In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we bless these warriors of Christ. You have completed what your fathers and grandfathers could not. The Church releases you from your crusade oaths with honor. Return to your homes, to your lands, to your families, knowing that Heaven witnesses your fidelity.\"\n\nThe crusaders - veterans of AlcalÃ¡, Loja, MÃ¡laga, the long siege of Granada - many of them drop to their knees. Giovanni Rossi, the one-handed blacksmith, is openly sobbing. Marco Tornesi, the former mercenary, stands rigid at attention but you can see his shoulders shaking.\n\nPope Eugenius turns back to you. \"Come. We will retire to private chambers. Cardinal Orsini, Cardinal Cesarini, Bishop Carrera - attend us. The rest...\" he addresses the other cardinals, \"...we will convene full consistory tomorrow to hear the full account of the Granada campaign. But for now, let us give thanks for this day.\"\n\nHe begins to turn toward the great doors of St. Peter's, then stops and looks back at you. His voice is quiet now, meant only for you and those closest: \"The Council of Basel has summoned me to appear before them. The Colonna family controls much of Rome's military strength. Milan's condottieri raid the Papal States. Emperor Sigismund arrives in five weeks hoping to mediate.\"\n\nHis eyes meet yours directly. \"Your arrival... whether you intended it or not... has changed the balance. For that, I am grateful. But we must speak carefully about what comes next. There are... complications.\"\n\nHe gestures toward the basilica doors. \"Shall we?\""

          "text": "1. Have Cardinal Orsini respond warmly - he remembers Juan from three years ago\n2. Set up the transition to private chambers\n3. Stop before any dialogue from Juan in the private meeting\n4. Let the Pope and cardinals speak first in the private chambers\n\nI need to remember:\n- Never generate Juan's dialogue or actions beyond what the user states\n- Cardinal Orsini was present at the original meeting with Pope Martin in 1430\n- He spoke fluent Castilian and was perceptive\n- He's now aged (would be around 68 years old)\n- He's been watching the papal-conciliar crisis unfold\n- The private meeting will include Pope Eugenius, Cardinal Orsini, Cardinal Cesarini (from Basel), and Bishop Carrera\n\nI should create the atmosphere of the private chambers and have the NPCs begin the conversation, then STOP for Juan to respond.\n\nSt. Peter's Steps\n\nCardinal Giordano Orsini's weathered face breaks into a genuine smile as you extend your hand. He clasps it firmly with both of his - his grip still strong despite his years.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says in fluent Castilian, his voice rough with emotion. \"Three years ago, you were a young king seeking papal blessing. I questioned you then - tested your motivations, your faith, your resolve. Do you remember?\"\n\nHe doesn't wait for an answer, his eyes glistening. \"I told Pope Martin afterward: 'He is genuinely seeking, genuinely uncertain, genuinely struggling with discernment.' And Martin wept and granted you everything.\" He squeezes your hand. \"We were right to trust you. God was right to trust you.\"\n\nHe releases your hand and switches to Latin, his voice carrying enough that nearby cardinals can hear: \"Welcome back to Rome, King of Castile. You return having accomplished what seemed impossible.\"\n\nPrivate Chambers - St. Peter's Basilica\n\nThe group moves through the great bronze doors into the basilica's cool interior, then through side passages into the papal apartments. The rooms are surprisingly austere - Pope Eugenius clearly lives simply despite his office. A wooden table, several chairs, a crucifix on the wall, and little else.\n\nPresent in the chamber:\n\nPope Eugenius IV, now without the papal tiara, looking somehow more human and more exhausted\n\nCardinal Giordano Orsini, settling into a chair with a slight groan\n\nCardinal Giuliano Cesarini - younger, perhaps forty, with intelligent eyes and the bearing of a diplomat. This is the man presiding over Basel as papal legate\n\nBishop Carrera, a Roman prelate in his fifties, clearly serving as recorder\n\nYour commanders remain outside with the relics and treasury under guard. Don Bernat de Centelles is positioned in an antechamber - close enough to be called if needed for the Naples discussion.\n\nPope Eugenius pours wine himself - another surprisingly humble gesture - and offers cups to you and the cardinals. He takes a long drink, then sits heavily in his chair.\n\n\"Let us speak plainly,\" he says, his voice tired but direct. \"The public ceremony was necessary - Rome needed to see your arrival, the cardinals needed to witness it, the message needed to be sent. But now we can speak as... as men facing difficult circumstances rather than as pontiff and king performing for an audience.\"\n\nHe sets down his cup. \"You've arrived at a moment of crisis for the Church. Not just crisis - multiple crises layered upon each other.\" He looks at Cardinal Cesarini. \"Giuliano, you've been at Basel since the beginning. Explain to His Majesty what we face.\"\n\nCardinal Cesarini leans forward, his expression grave. \"Your Majesty, the Council of Basel convened in July 1431 - four months after His Holiness was elected. Pope Martin had called for it before his death, seeking church reform. But from the beginning, there have been... fundamental disagreements about authority.\"\n\nHe chooses his words carefully. \"The Council claims supreme authority over the Pope based on decrees from Constance. They say a council can judge, correct, even depose a pope. His Holiness issued a bull dissolving the Council in December 1431, calling for a new one at Bologna. The Council refused. They declared themselves ecumenical and summoned His Holiness to appear before them.\"\n\nPope Eugenius's jaw tightens at this. \"Summoned. Like a priest accused of simony.\"\n\nCardinal Orsini adds quietly, \"The theological question is profound, Your Majesty. Does supreme authority rest with Peter's successor, or with the assembled bishops in council? It's not merely about power - it's about the very nature of how Christ structured His Church.\"\n\nCardinal Cesarini continues: \"Emperor Sigismund has been trying to mediate. He came to Rome last May, was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by His Holiness. He convinced both sides to compromise - His Holiness acknowledged Basel as ecumenical, withdrew the dissolution. Basel stopped pressing their most extreme claims. But it's an unstable peace.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"And then there are the practical matters. The Council is negotiating with the Hussites - the Bohemian heretics. They're considering granting communion in both kinds, vernacular preaching, limits on church property. Some of these reforms have merit. But the method...\" He glances at the Pope. \"If Basel grants these concessions to end the Hussite wars, does it validate winning theological arguments through military force? Do we encourage every future heretic to raise an army and wait for the Church to negotiate?\"\n\nPope Eugenius speaks, his voice bitter: \"And while we debate theology, practical realities press. The Colonna family - relatives of Pope Martin - control much of Rome. They're angry I demanded return of properties Martin granted them. Milan's condottieri raid the Papal States. Florence and Venice look to me for support against Milan, but that creates more enemies. Rome itself...\" He gestures vaguely. \"You saw it in the streets. The city is divided.\"\n\nCardinal Orsini looks at you directly. \"Your arrival changes the equation, Your Majesty. Whether you intended it or not. The Basel faction claims papal authority has failed, that popes cannot effectively lead the Church, that councils must exercise supreme authority. And then you arrive - the young king who received papal crusade authority three years ago - bearing proof that papal authority, properly exercised, can accomplish miracles.\"\n\nBishop Carrera, the recorder, speaks for the first time: \"Half the cardinals outside see you as providential vindication of papal supremacy. The other half see you as dangerous foreign interference being used to manipulate Church politics.\"\n\nPope Eugenius drains his wine cup and pours another. \"So. That is the situation. I'm embattled on multiple fronts - theological, political, military. Your arrival strengthens my position enormously. It also makes you controversial.\"\n\nHe looks at you with those tired, intelligent eyes. \"You came to return relics and be released from your crusade oath. But you also brought petitions. The Military Orders - you want permanent royal control. King Alfonso's Naples claim - you want papal support against René of Anjou. Perhaps other matters as well.\"\n\nHe sets down his cup. \"I am inclined to grant what you ask. You've earned it. Castile has earned it. But we must discuss how to manage the political implications. Every decision I make is scrutinized by Basel supporters, by the Colonna, by the Emperor's representatives, by every faction watching for advantage.\"\n\nCardinal Cesarini adds: \"Your presence at Basel would be... significant, Your Majesty. The Council needs to see you. To hear directly about Granada. To understand that papal authority can work. But it must be handled carefully.\"\n\nThe room falls silent. Four pairs of eyes watch you, waiting."

          "text": "Good question. Let me check the historical situation with Cardinal Cesarini and Basel in April 1433.\n\nFrom my earlier search results:\n- Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini opened the Council of Basel on July 23, 1431 as papal legate\n- Pope Eugenius IV tried to dissolve the council on December 18, 1431\n- The council refused to dissolve and summoned the Pope\n- Emperor Sigismund mediated - crowned emperor at Rome on May 31, 1433\n- A compromise was arranged where Pope acknowledged the council as ecumenical on August 1, 1433 (first version) and December 15, 1433 (amended version)\n\nSo in April 1433, we're BEFORE the compromise. The Pope dissolved the council, the council refused, they're in standoff. Emperor Sigismund is coming to mediate (arriving May 31, 1433).\n\nNow, would Cardinal Cesarini as papal legate be in Rome in April 1433, or would he be at Basel?\n\nHistorically, Cesarini was the papal legate presiding over Basel, but he was trying to mediate between the Pope and the council. He was in a difficult position - sent by the Pope to preside, but the council was defying papal authority.\n\nGiven that:\n1. The Emperor is coming to Rome (arriving May 31) to mediate\n2. The situation is at crisis point\n3. Cesarini would need to consult with the Pope before the Emperor arrives\n4. April 1433 is right before the imperial mediation\n\nIt's plausible Cesarini could be in Rome for consultations before the Emperor arrives. BUT I should verify this or at least acknowledge the uncertainty.\n\nActually, from the CHARACTER_DATABASE.md:\n\"Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini: Presiding as papal legate at Council of Basel (1432 onward)\"\nAnd it lists his current location as \"Basel, Switzerland (Council of Basel)\"\n\nSo according to the campaign documents, Cesarini is AT BASEL, not in Rome.\n\nI recognize my mistake in positioning Cesarini. He's definitively at Basel during this critical period, managing the council's proceedings. Other papal representatives would handle any Roman consultations.\n\nYou're absolutely right to question this - I made an error.\n\nWeb Search: Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini Basel Council April 1433 location\n\nJulian Cesarini - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nCATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Giuliano Cesarini newadvent.org\n\nCouncil of Florence - Wikipedia wikipedia.org\n\nCouncil of Basel | Description, History, & Facts | Britannica britannica.com\n\nCATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Council of Florence newadvent.org\n\nCouncil of Basel -- Britannica Academic qnl.qa\n\nGiuliano Cesarini | Catholic Answers Encyclopedia catholic.com\n\nCouncil Of Basel | Encyclopedia.com encyclopedia.com\n\nBasel, Council of ccel.org\n\nMedievalChurch.org.uk: Council of Basel (1431 - 1449) medievalchurch.org.uk\n\nPerfect, the research confirms what the player suspected and what the CHARACTER_DATABASE says. Cardinal Cesarini is at Basel presiding over the council in April 1433. He doesn't leave Basel until 1437 when the council splits over where to meet with the Greeks. \n\nThe historical record is clear:\n- Cesarini opened the Council of Basel on July 23, 1431\n- When Pope Eugenius tried to dissolve it in December 1431, Cesarini \"successfully resisted the efforts of Eugene IV to dissolve the council\"\n- Cesarini stayed at Basel as president throughout this period\n- He only left in 1437 when the council split over the Greek negotiations\n\nSo Cesarini would NOT be in Rome in April 1433. He's at Basel, leading the council that is in standoff with the Pope.\n\nI need to correct this error immediately. I should:\n1. Acknowledge the mistake\n2. Remove Cesarini from the scene\n3. Explain why this makes sense historically\n4. Replace him with a different cardinal who WOULD be with the Pope in Rome\n\nLet me think about who would be with Pope Eugenius in April 1433:\n- Cardinal Orsini - definitely, he's in Rome and loyal to the Pope\n- Other cardinals loyal to the Pope who haven't gone to Basel\n- Perhaps a Roman cardinal like Bishop Carrera\n\nI'll correct this now.\n\nYou're absolutely right - I made a significant error. Let me correct this immediately.\n\nCORRECTION:\n\nCardinal Giuliano Cesarini is NOT in Rome in April 1433. He's at Basel, presiding over the Council as papal legate. In fact, historically he's in the middle of successfully resisting Pope Eugenius's attempts to dissolve the council. He doesn't leave Basel until 1437 when the council splits over where to meet with the Greeks.\n\nHaving Cesarini here with the Pope makes no sense - he's literally leading the opposition to papal authority at Basel right now, even though he's the Pope's own legate. It's one of those complex medieval situations where someone can be both papal legate and defender of conciliar supremacy.\n\nLet me rewind the scene to correct this:\n\nPrivate Chambers - St. Peter's Basilica (CORRECTED)\n\nPresent in the chamber:\n\nPope Eugenius IV\n\nCardinal Giordano Orsini\n\nBishop Carrera (Roman prelate serving as recorder)\n\nPerhaps 1-2 other cardinals loyal to the Pope\n\nCardinal Orsini speaks after pouring wine:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the situation is dire. Cardinal Cesarini - my colleague, a good man - is at Basel right now presiding over the council. He opened it as papal legate in 1431, but when His Holiness tried to dissolve it, Cesarini sided with the council. He's not our enemy - he wants reform - but he believes the council has supreme authority over the Pope.\"\n\nPope Eugenius's face tightens. \"Cesarini won't return my letters. He thinks I'm destroying the Church by resisting Basel's claims. He doesn't understand - or won't understand - that what they demand would make every pope subject to every council's whims.\"\n\nBishop Carrera adds: \"The Council claims authority based on Constance's decrees. They've summoned His Holiness to appear before them. Summoned, like a priest accused of simony.\"\n\nThe conversation continues from there about the Basel crisis, the Colonna threat, Emperor Sigismund's upcoming arrival, etc.\n\nThank you for catching that error. It would have been a significant historical mistake to have Cesarini in Rome when he's actually at Basel in active standoff with the Pope.\n\nShall we continue from this corrected version?"

It has to, let me explain.\n\n\nChristian morals guide us, they set me and my people on the right path. It's laws bring resolution and it's monestaries are centres of development and learning. It unites us and lets us fight for a higher purpose. I have committed my life to being a good Christian and will die defending it and it's institutions.\n\n\nWhich is exactly why any accusations of sins by the clergy or even actual sins by church members are terrible. And it makes me feel helpless as well.\n\n\nHelpless because I have no defence against it. I have placed all my trust and faith into the church and I refuse to believe that such a thing is even possible. And even if it would happen, all I can think - all I want to think - is that the church handles it swiftly, justly and internally.\n\n\nThe church of Rome is a shining beacon, a light coming straight from God's kingdom. We have built it up to great hights. Should we lose it...I cannot even imagine that. I would be nothing without the church, without my faith. Do you understand father? I will not allow thought of the church to be somehow impure to enter my mind. Like I would never want to question the sanctity of the confession, or the justness of the church's law. Doing so would invite chaos.\n\n\nInstead, I fight for the kingdom of God's image. As the world should be. The flock, myself included being faithful and labouring to build God's kingdom. And a church who's moral authority is absolute and is totally without any corruption or sin.\n\n\nMe and my bishops in Castille have thought long and hard about what to do and eventually we decided to send a delegation to Basel. We did so without giving thought to the current wars and alliances that influence Basel attendance. Instead we motivated our attendance purelly based on theological grounds and came to the conclusion that it was also Rome's will that the council be held.\n\n\nI remind you that I have pledged my sword if need be to fight the Hussites in Bohemia should we fail to some together like christians. I will always fight for Christianity.\n\n\nI kneel down before the pope.\n\n\nBut please father, understand the impossible position I find myself in when I witness sins in the church itself. Please protect me from ever making an impossible choice.\n\n\nJuan gets emotional.\n\n\nDraft a d100 table to see how the pope responds."

          "text": "Juan is making a very sophisticated argument here:\n1. He's expressing absolute loyalty to the Church and papal authority\n2. He's explaining his psychological/spiritual need for the Church to be pure\n3. He's subtly addressing the scandal of church corruption WITHOUT directly accusing anyone\n4. He's explaining why he sent the Basel delegation on theological grounds\n5. He's offering military support against Hussites\n6. He's becoming emotional and vulnerable, asking the Pope to \"protect\" him from having to choose\n\nThis is NOT about asking for something material. This is about establishing a deep spiritual/political alliance while navigating the extremely delicate Basel situation.\n\n**Success Factors** (present at all roll levels):\n- Demonstrates absolute loyalty to Church and papal authority\n- Shows genuine faith and spiritual depth\n- Explains Basel delegation on theological grounds (not political maneuvering)\n- Offers military support against Hussites\n- Vulnerable and emotional - not calculating\n- Understands Pope's impossible position\n- Frames self as needing Pope's guidance/protection\n- Completed Reconquista strengthens credibility\n- Timing - Pope desperately needs allies\n\n**Failure Factors** (present at all roll levels):\n- This is still somewhat naive/idealistic about church corruption\n- Pope knows church corruption exists and can't promise \"purity\"\n- Basel delegation complicates things - they're at the council right now\n- Offering to fight Hussites is complicated - Basel is negotiating with them\n- Pope might see this as manipulation despite emotional sincerity\n- Any strong alliance with foreign king has political costs\n- Colonna watching, Basel supporters watching\n- Emperor Sigismund arriving soon with his own agenda\n\nThis is a PERSUASION roll about how well Juan's approach lands.\n\nThe approach quality: EXCELLENT\n- Deeply personal and vulnerable\n- Sophisticated understanding of theological stakes\n- Not asking for anything material immediately\n- Demonstrates he's not just a political actor\n\n- Addresses Basel without seeming to take sides\n\nI'll design roll ranges that capture the nuanced diplomatic complexity. The table reflects Juan's delicate positioning - showing support without direct intervention. Each range reveals the Pope's emotional and strategic response, acknowledging Juan's sophisticated approach while maintaining institutional caution. The progression shows increasing trust and potential alliance, with even moderate rolls indicating the strength of Juan's carefully crafted argument.\n\nLegendary spiritual encounter transforms the entire relationship, representing a profound breakthrough beyond typical diplomatic interactions.\n\nPrivate Chambers - St. Peter's Basilica\n\nYou kneel before Pope Eugenius IV, your voice breaking with emotion. The words pour out - not calculated political speech, but raw confession of faith and fear. The room is utterly silent. Cardinal Orsini has tears in his eyes. Bishop Carrera has stopped taking notes, simply watching.\n\nPope Eugenius stands frozen, his thin face working with emotion. The exhaustion in his eyes is suddenly mixed with something else.\n\nD100 TABLE: POPE EUGENIUS IV'S RESPONSE TO JUAN'S CONFESSION\n(Persuasion Roll - How Does This Deeply Personal Approach Land?)\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS (Present at All Roll Levels):\n\nJuan demonstrates absolute, genuine faith and loyalty\n\nVulnerability and emotion clearly sincere, not calculated\n\nUnderstands the spiritual stakes for ordinary believers\n\nExplains Basel delegation on theological grounds (not politics)\n\nOffers military support against Hussites\n\nNot asking for anything material - seeking spiritual guidance\n\nCompleted Reconquista proves his faithfulness\n\nPope desperately needs someone who still believes in Church's purity\n\nTiming providential - Pope questioning his own decisions\n\nThis is exactly what Pope needs to hear right now\n\nFAILURE FACTORS (Present at All Roll Levels):\n\nPope knows church corruption exists - can't promise purity Juan seeks\n\nJuan's idealism is touching but somewhat naive\n\nBasel delegation complicates situation - they're there right now\n\nFighting Hussites complicated - Basel negotiating with them\n\nAny strong response creates political obligations\n\nColonna and Basel factions watching closely\n\nEmperor Sigismund arriving with own agenda\n\nPope's personality: cautious, has been burned before\n\nStrong alliance with foreign king has costs\n\n1-12: MOVED BUT GUARDED\n\nPope Eugenius helps you to your feet, his hand trembling slightly. He's clearly moved but struggling with how to respond.\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" He pauses, choosing words carefully. \"Your faith honors Christ. Your devotion to the Church is... it's what every Christian king should show. We are grateful for your loyalty, for your delegation to Basel, for your offer of military support.\"\n\nHe glances at Cardinal Orsini, then back to you. \"But we must speak honestly. The Church you defend - the shining beacon without corruption - that is the Church as Christ intends it. As we all pray it to be. But the Church as it exists...\" He trails off, clearly struggling.\n\n\"There are sins in the Church. Simony, concubinage, neglect of duty. Some of what Basel demands - the reforms, not the claims to supremacy - they're needed. We cannot promise you the purity you seek. We can only promise to fight for it.\"\n\nHis voice is kind but distant. \"You ask us to protect you from impossible choices. But we ourselves face impossible choices daily. Between Basel's reforms and Basel's rebellion. Between the Colonna's power and Rome's governance. Between ideals and realities.\"\n\nHe sits heavily. \"You're a good king and a faithful Christian. That makes you rare and precious. We value your support. But we cannot promise to shield you from the Church's struggles. They are everyone's struggles now.\"\n\nWhat this means:\n\nPope appreciates sentiment but remains politically cautious\n\nAcknowledges church corruption exists\n\nDoesn't fully embrace Juan's idealism\n\nWarm but keeps emotional distance\n\nWill discuss practical matters (petitions, etc.) but without deep bond forming\n\nJuan's faith noted but Pope doesn't feel transformed by it\n\nRelationship remains cordial but not intimate\n\n13-28: GRATEFUL BUT BURDENED\n\nPope Eugenius pulls you to your feet and embraces you - longer than protocol requires. When he releases you, there are tears in his eyes.\n\n\"Juan of Castile.\" His voice is thick with emotion. \"Do you know how rare it is to hear what you just said? A king who still believes the Church can be pure? Who places faith above politics? Who refuses to believe corruption can touch God's institution?\"\n\nHe wipes his eyes. \"We are surrounded by men who see only power. Cardinals who scheme. Nobles who threaten. Council fathers who claim supremacy not from faith but from ambition. And then you arrive, bearing the True Cross, speaking of... of innocence. Of faith.\"\n\nHe sits, gestures for you to sit as well. \"You ask us to protect you from impossible choices. God knows we wish we could. But the Church you defend - without sin, without corruption - it doesn't exist. Not in Rome. Not in Basel. Not anywhere men gather in the name of Christ.\"\n\nHis face hardens slightly. \"Basel is right that reforms are needed. They're wrong that councils are supreme. But how do we reform without submitting to their claims? How do we maintain papal authority while admitting our sins? This is our impossible choice.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"Your faith moves us. Your loyalty strengthens us. Your offer to fight for Christendom - we accept it gratefully. But we cannot promise you the pure Church you need to believe in. We can only promise to struggle toward it, knowing we'll fail, and struggle again.\"\n\nWhat this means:\n\nPope deeply moved by Juan's sincerity\n\nOpens up about his own struggles more than he typically would\n\nAppreciates the spiritual support but can't fully embrace Juan's idealism\n\nRelationship warming but Pope still maintains some distance\n\nWill seriously consider petitions\n\nForms respect but not yet deep alliance\n\nJuan's presence helps but doesn't transform situation\n\n29-47: DEEPLY MOVED - SPIRITUAL RECOGNITION\n\nPope Eugenius falls to his knees beside you. Cardinal Orsini gasps. This is extraordinary - the Vicar of Christ kneeling beside a king.\n\n\"Stop,\" the Pope says, voice breaking. \"Don't kneel to us. We're not worthy of such faith.\" He takes your hands in his. \"Three years ago, Pope Martin wept when you offered everything to God. Do you know why he wept?\"\n\nHe doesn't wait for answer. \"Because he saw innocence. Pure faith. A young king who actually believed what we all claim to believe. And he knew - as we know now - how rare that is. How precious.\"\n\nHe pulls you both to standing, still gripping your hands. \"You speak of the Church as beacon without corruption. Of moral authority that must remain absolute. Of refusing to believe sins are possible in Christ's institution.\" His voice trembles. \"We have lost that. We who wear the papal tiara have lost the ability to believe in the Church's purity because we see the corruption daily. The simony, the concubinage, the political scheming, the cardinals who plot...\"\n\nHe releases your hands, turns away. \"Basel demands reforms. They're right. The Church needs reform. But they claim supremacy over Peter's throne to force those reforms. They want to make every pope subject to every council. If we submit, we destroy papal authority forever. If we resist, they call us corrupt tyrants opposing needed change.\"\n\nHe turns back, tears streaming. \"You ask us to protect you from impossible choices. We cannot. But your faith - your innocent belief that the Church must be pure because God is pure - it reminds us why we fight. Not for power. Not for authority. But because someone must defend the idea of the Church, even when the reality fails.\"\n\nCardinal Orsini speaks quietly: \"Your Majesty gave His Holiness something he desperately needed. Hope that not everyone sees the Church as mere political institution.\"\n\nPope Eugenius nods. \"Your delegation at Basel - you sent them on theological grounds. Your offer to fight Hussites - from faith, not politics. Your crusade - completed with honor. You are what Christian kingship should be.\"\n\nHe embraces you. \"We will support your petitions. The Military Orders should belong to the crown that completed the Reconquista. Alfonso's Naples claim - we will advocate for it. And when you go to Basel, when you witness the theological debates, remember this: you fight for the Church Christ intended, not the Church that exists. That's what we need.\"\n\nWhat this means:\n\nPope experiences genuine spiritual moment\n\nForms deep personal bond with Juan\n\nOpens up completely about his struggles\n\nSees Juan as rare ally who still believes\n\nPetitions will be granted\n\nStrong alliance forming\n\nJuan's innocence/faith actually helps Pope psychologically\n\nBut Pope still can't promise the purity Juan seeks\n\n48-65: BREAKTHROUGH MOMENT - MUTUAL RECOGNITION\n\nPope Eugenius stares at you for a long moment after you finish speaking. Then, to everyone's shock, he removes the papal tiara and sets it on the table. Just a thin, exhausted man in white robes now.\n\n\"Cardinal Orsini, Bishop Carrera - leave us. Just for a moment.\"\n\nThe two clergy exchange glances but obey, closing the door behind them. You're alone with the Pope.\n\nHe kneels beside you. \"I'm going to tell you something I've told no one. When Basel summoned me - demanded I appear before them like a common priest - I questioned everything. Not just whether I was right to resist. But whether God still wanted me as Pope. Whether I'd failed so completely that the Church had to be restructured to save it.\"\n\nHis voice breaks. \"I prayed for a sign. Any sign. That I hadn't destroyed everything through my stubbornness. That papal authority still had divine favor. That someone, somewhere, still believed the Church could be what Christ intended.\"\n\nHe looks at you, tears streaming. \"And then you arrived. The king who completed the Reconquista under papal authority. Who returns sacred relics and crusade treasury with honor. Who speaks of the Church as if... as if it's still holy. As if corruption hasn't touched it. As if faith still matters more than power.\"\n\nHe grips your shoulders. \"You ask me to protect you from impossible choices. I cannot. But you've given me something more precious. You've reminded me why the impossible choice matters. Why defending papal authority isn't just about power, but about defending the idea that God's Church can exist in this fallen world.\"\n\nHe stands, helps you up. \"Your delegation at Basel argues on theological grounds. Good. They need to see that some still care about theology more than politics. Your offer to fight Hussites if negotiations fail - we accept. Not because we want war, but because someone must be willing to defend Christendom with more than words.\"\n\nHe picks up the tiara, places it back on his head. When he speaks now, it's with new strength: \"The Military Orders belong to you. The crown that completed the Reconquista deserves permanent control. Alfonso's Naples claim - we will support it strongly. We will write letters to every Christian monarch explaining why Castile's crusade proves papal authority works when exercised with pure faith.\"\n\nHe opens the door, calls the others back in. To Cardinal Orsini: \"Send word to our supporters - His Majesty King Juan of Castile stands with us. Not from politics, but from faith. Let Basel hear it. Let the Colonna hear it. Let everyone hear it.\"\n\nTo you: \"When you go to Basel, speak as you spoke here. Remind them what the Church is supposed to be. They've forgotten in their debates about authority and reform. You haven't forgotten. God sent you for this.\"\n\nWhat this means:\n\nPope experiences profound personal breakthrough\n\nDeep spiritual bond formed\n\nAll petitions granted immediately\n\nPope sees Juan as answer to his prayers\n\nStrong public alliance will be proclaimed\n\nJuan's faith genuinely transforms Pope's outlook\n\nBut complications remain - Basel won't be easy\n\nColonna will respond to this alliance\n\nEmperor Sigismund's mediation affected\n\n66-82: TRANSFORMATIVE SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE\n\nPope Eugenius stares at you as you kneel, tears streaming down your face, begging him to protect your faith. Then something breaks in him.\n\nHe collapses to his knees beside you and begins sobbing - deep, wrenching sobs that shake his thin frame. Cardinal Orsini moves to help him but the Pope waves him away.\n\n\"No. Let me... I need...\" He can barely speak through the tears. \"Three years. Three years of fighting Basel, fighting the Colonna, fighting everyone. Three years of questioning whether I destroyed the Church by resisting the council. Whether I'm the problem. Whether papal authority is just my pride.\"\n\nHe grips your hands, his tears falling on them. \"And you... you speak of the Church as if it's still pure. As if corruption is unthinkable. As if papal authority comes from God and not from politics. You actually believe it. You're not lying. You're not manipulating. You believe.\"\n\nHe pulls you close, embracing you like a father. \"Pope Martin saw this in you. He saw innocence we'd all lost. Faith we'd all compromised. He wept because he knew you would suffer when you discovered the truth. But he gave you the crusade anyway, praying you'd keep that innocence somehow.\"\n\nHe releases you, stands, helps you up. His face is transformed - the exhaustion is still there, but something else now. Hope. Determination.\n\n\"You completed the Reconquista. Seven centuries ended under papal authority. You return everything with honor. Your delegation at Basel argues theology, not politics. You offer to fight Hussites from faith, not strategy.\" He's speaking faster now, voice strengthening. \"This is the answer. This is God's answer to my doubts.\"\n\nHe turns to Cardinal Orsini. \"Giordano, do you see? When we act with pure faith, when we exercise papal authority not for power but for Christ, God grants victory. Juan proves it. Granada proves it. The True Cross returning to Rome proves it.\"\n\nTo Bishop Carrera: \"Record this. King Juan II of Castile has demonstrated what papal authority accomplishes when exercised righteously. Let it be proclaimed to all Christendom.\"\n\nBack to you, gripping your shoulders: \"I cannot protect you from discovering the Church's sins. They exist. Simony, corruption, all of it. But I can promise you this: you will not face impossible choices alone. When Basel forces you to choose between reform and authority, we will face it together. When you must decide whether to fight or negotiate with heretics, we will decide together. You are not just our ally - you are our conscience.\"\n\nHe sits, gestures for everyone to sit. When he speaks now, it's with clarity he hasn't shown before:\n\n\"The Military Orders are yours. Permanently. Crown control written into perpetuity. No pope can revoke it.\n\n\"Alfonso's Naples claim - we will write to every Christian monarch supporting it. René of Anjou's claim will be declared invalid.\n\n\"Your Basel delegation - we will send instructions they should work with Cardinal Cesarini despite his current stance. He's a good man confused by bad theology. Your witness might bring him back.\n\n\"When you go to Basel yourself, you speak with our full authority. Not as ambassador, but as our voice. You who completed the Reconquista, who kept pure faith, you tell them what the Church should be.\"\n\nCardinal Orsini speaks quietly: \"Your Holiness, this level of support for a foreign king - the Colonna will react. Basel supporters among the cardinals will claim you're using external pressure.\"\n\nPope Eugenius's voice is steel now: \"Let them. For three years I've compromised, retreated, questioned myself. Juan has shown me God hasn't abandoned papal authority. If the Colonna threaten, we have eight hundred crusaders in our plaza. If Basel objects, we point to Granada. This is our stand.\"\n\nHe looks at you. \"You asked me to protect your faith. I cannot make the Church pure. But I can promise we will fight together to reform it. We will face Basel together. We will face everything together. You gave me back my certainty. I will not abandon you.\"\n\nWhat this means:\n\nPope experiences complete spiritual transformation\n\nDeepest possible alliance formed\n\nAll petitions granted with extraordinary terms\n\nJuan becomes Pope's most trusted advisor\n\nPublic proclamation will create major political event\n\nBasel faction will be shaken\n\nColonna must respond - this changes Rome's balance\n\nEmperor Sigismund's mediation complicated but Juan's presence may help\n\nPope's psychology fundamentally shifted\n\nBut this creates enemies and complications\n\n83-93: DIVINE MOMENT - LEGENDARY BOND\n\nEverything from 66-82, plus:\n\nAs Pope Eugenius embraces you, still sobbing, something extraordinary happens. The afternoon light streaming through the window seems to intensify. Cardinal Orsini later swears the room glowed. Bishop Carrera will write in his chronicle: \"I witnessed a moment of grace.\"\n\nWhen the Pope releases you, his face is completely transformed. The exhaustion, the doubt, the fear - gone. In its place: absolute certainty.\n\n\"This is why Martin sent you to Rome three years ago. Not just for Granada. For this moment. For me. For the Church.\" His voice carries divine authority now. \"You are God's answer to the papal-conciliar crisis. Not through armies or politics, but through faith.\"\n\nHe turns to the door, throws it open. Cardinals are waiting outside - they heard the commotion. \"Come. All of you. Witness this.\"\n\nA dozen cardinals file in - supporters and Basel sympathizers both. The Pope points to you.\n\n\"Behold a Christian king. He completed the Reconquista under papal authority. He returns sacred relics with honor. He sent his delegation to Basel not from politics but from theology. He offers to fight Hussites from faith. And just now, he wept before us, begging God to protect his belief in the Church's purity.\"\n\nHis voice fills the room. \"This is what we've lost. This innocence. This faith. We debate authority and reform as if they're political questions. He shows us they're spiritual questions. When Basel claims councils are supreme, he asks: 'How can the Church be corrupted?' When we fear losing power, he asks: 'How do we keep faith pure?'\"\n\nSeveral Basel-supporting cardinals look uncomfortable. But they're listening.\n\n\"We declare before all present: King Juan II of Castile is defender of the faith. Not just defender of the Church's territory - defender of what the Church means. When he goes to Basel, he speaks with our voice. When he argues theology, he argues our position. When he offers solutions, we endorse them.\"\n\nHe pulls you forward. \"The Military Orders belong to Castile forever. Alfonso of Aragón's Naples claim is just and we will fight for it. Any enemy of Castile becomes enemy of Rome. Any alliance Castile makes, we support.\"\n\nCardinal Orsini is weeping openly. Even some Basel supporters look moved.\n\nPope Eugenius addresses them all: \"For three years we have questioned, compromised, retreated. No more. God sent us a sign we cannot ignore. The young king who completed the impossible, who kept pure faith, who still believes the Church can be holy. This is our answer to Basel. Not arguments about supremacy, but proof that papal authority, rightly exercised, accomplishes God's will.\"\n\nLater that evening, as news spreads through Rome:\n\nThree Basel-supporting cardinals request private audience with Pope\n\nColonna family patriarch sends urgent message requesting meeting\n\nEmperor Sigismund's representatives send dispatches to Germany\n\nRoman crowds gather outside St. Peter's chanting prayers\n\nSomething has shifted in Rome's spiritual atmosphere\n\nYour arrival has become watershed moment. Not just politically - spiritually. The Church will debate its meaning for generations.\n\nWhat this means:\n\nLegendary spiritual moment witnessed by many\n\nPope completely transformed\n\nStrongest possible alliance formed\n\nMajor political realignment beginning in Rome\n\nBasel faction severely shaken\n\nEven skeptics recognize something extraordinary happened\n\nYour role at Basel becomes pivotal\n\nBut also creates powerful enemies\n\nChurch politics fundamentally altered\n\n94-100: ACTS OF GOD - HISTORICAL TRANSFORMATION\n\nEverything from 83-93, plus:\n\nAs the Pope opens the door and cardinals file in, the bells of St. Peter's begin ringing - unprompted. Then, as in the morning, every church bell in Rome joins. The same phenomenon as your arrival, but now at sunset.\n\nThe cardinals freeze. Cardinal Orsini whispers: \"Twice in one day...\"\n\nThrough the window, you can see the plaza. The 800 crusaders who marched through Rome this morning are kneeling. So are thousands of Romans who gathered throughout the day. No one signaled them. They simply... knew.\n\nPope Eugenius walks to the window, you beside him. The entire city seems to be praying. The bells continue.\n\n\"Martin,\" the Pope whispers. \"Pope Martin, if you can see this from Heaven... thank you for trusting him. Thank you for sending him to Granada. Thank you for this moment.\"\n\nHe turns to the assembled cardinals - all of them on their knees now, even the Basel supporters. \"God speaks. When we doubt, when we question, when we forget why we fight - God speaks. Through bells no human rang. Through a king who kept faith. Through the completion of seven centuries of crusade.\"\n\nHis voice breaks: \"We are not worthy of this sign. But we will not ignore it.\"\n\nOver the next three days:\n\nFive Basel-supporting cardinals publicly renounce conciliar supremacy\n\nColonna patriarch comes to Vatican, kneels before Pope, seeks reconciliation\n\nEmperor Sigismund receives reports, writes: \"God has rendered judgment. I come to Rome not to mediate but to witness.\"\n\nWord spreads across Christendom with extraordinary speed\n\nKings from France to Hungary send urgent inquiries\n\nAt Basel, Cardinal Cesarini receives multiple reports and enters profound spiritual crisis\n\nBy end of week, Basel Council is divided and uncertain\n\nYou didn't come to Rome to transform church politics. You came to return relics and be released from your oath. But God, through your pure faith and perfect timing, has used you to shift the entire papal-conciliar conflict.\n\nThe Pope summons you the next morning, speaks quietly: \"What happened yesterday... that wasn't us. That wasn't you. That was God using our meeting to make a statement about His Church. We don't fully understand it yet. But we know this: your role in healing the Church is just beginning.\"\n\nWhen you're ready, I'll roll for the Pope's response."

          "text": "- Pope removes papal tiara\n- Sends others away for private confession\n- Reveals his deepest doubts about whether God still wanted him as Pope\n- Sees Juan's arrival and faith as answer to his prayers\n- Forms deep spiritual bond\n- Grants all petitions immediately\n- Will proclaim strong public alliance\n- Pope experiences psychological transformation through Juan's innocence/faith\n\nI need to narrate this carefully, showing the Pope's vulnerability, the genuine spiritual moment, and the practical implications while NEVER generating dialogue or actions for Juan. I should end by showing what happens next - the doors reopening, the proclamations being made, and setting up the next phase of interactions.\n\nThis is a major turning point in the campaign. The Pope is genuinely moved and transformed, creating the strongest possible alliance. But this will also create complications with Basel supporters, the Colonna, and others.\n\nPrivate Chambers - St. Peter's Basilica\n\nPope Eugenius IV stares at you for a long moment after you finish speaking, your voice breaking with emotion, tears streaming down your face as you kneel before him. The room is utterly silent.\n\nThen, slowly, deliberately, the Pope reaches up and removes the papal tiara from his head. He sets it carefully on the table. Just a thin, exhausted man in white robes now.\n\n\"Cardinal Orsini, Bishop Carrera.\" His voice is quiet but firm. \"Leave us. Just for a moment.\"\n\nThe two clergy exchange shocked glances. Cardinal Orsini opens his mouth as if to protest, then closes it. They bow and exit, closing the door behind them.\n\nYou're alone with Pope Eugenius IV.\n\nHe kneels beside you on the floor - not before you, but beside you, as one man to another. When he speaks, his voice trembles.\n\n\"I'm going to tell you something I've told no one. Not the cardinals. Not my confessors. No one.\" He pauses, gathering courage. \"When the Council of Basel summoned me - demanded that I, the successor of Peter, appear before them like a common priest accused of crimes - I didn't just question whether I was right to resist them. I questioned... everything.\"\n\nHis hands shake as he grips them together. \"I asked God: Have I failed so completely that You no longer want me as Your Vicar? Have I destroyed the Church through my stubbornness? Should I submit to Basel because perhaps councils should be supreme if popes can fail this badly? Maybe... maybe I'm the problem.\"\n\nTears begin streaming down his face. \"For three years I've fought. The Colonna, Basel, Milan's armies, cardinals who desert me, cities in revolt. And every day I ask myself: Am I defending Christ's Church, or am I defending my own pride? Is papal authority divine, or is it just my refusal to admit I'm wrong?\"\n\nHe looks at you directly now, eyes red and desperate. \"I prayed for a sign. Any sign. That God still wanted papal authority to exist. That someone, somewhere, still believed the Church could be what Christ intended. That faith still mattered more than these endless political calculations.\"\n\nHis voice breaks completely. \"And then you arrived. The young king who completed the Reconquista under papal authority - the very authority Basel says has failed. Who returns the sacred relics with perfect honor. Who sends his delegation to Basel because of theology, not politics. Who offers to fight for Christendom from faith, not strategy.\"\n\nHe grips your shoulders. \"And now you kneel before me, weeping, begging me to protect your faith. To preserve your belief that the Church is pure. To shield you from seeing corruption in Christ's institution. You speak of the Church as if... as if it's still holy. As if it's still the beacon of light you need it to be.\"\n\nHe pulls you into an embrace - not pope to king, but one desperate Christian to another. \"You ask me to protect you from impossible choices. I cannot. The corruption you fear exists. Simony, concubinage, cardinals who scheme, bishops who neglect their flocks, all of it. I cannot promise you the pure Church you need to believe in.\"\n\nHe releases you, sits back, wipes his tears. \"But you've given me something more precious than gold or armies. You've reminded me why the impossible choice matters. You still believe the Church can be God's instrument on earth. You completed the Reconquista and your faith didn't break. You see papal authority not as political power but as divine trust.\"\n\nHe stands, helps you to your feet. His face is transformed - the crushing doubt, the exhaustion, they're still there, but underneath now: hope. Determination.\n\n\"You said you refuse to believe corruption can touch the Church. That's innocence we've all lost. Pope Martin saw it in you three years ago. That's why he wept when you offered everything. He knew the world would try to destroy that innocence. But you kept it. Through seven hundred battles, through years of war, through all the compromise and horror of conquest - you kept it.\"\n\nHe walks to the window, looks out over Rome. \"Your delegation at Basel argues theology. Good. Someone must. Your offer to fight Hussites if faith demands it - I accept. Not because I want war, but because someone must be willing to defend Christendom with more than words.\"\n\nHe turns back, voice strengthening with each word. \"The Military Orders belong to you. The crown that completed the Reconquista under papal authority deserves permanent control. No future pope can revoke it. Alfonso's Naples claim - I will support it strongly, publicly. We will write to every Christian monarch explaining why Castile proved papal authority works when exercised with pure faith and humble submission to God's will.\"\n\nHe picks up the papal tiara, places it back on his head. When he speaks now, it's with new authority: \"You asked me to protect your faith. I cannot make the Church pure - that's beyond any pope's power while men remain fallen. But I can promise you this: you will not face impossible choices alone. When Basel forces you to choose between reform and authority, we will face it together. When corruption in the Church threatens your faith, we will fight it together. You are not just our ally in politics - you are our conscience in faith.\"\n\nHe strides to the door, throws it open. Cardinal Orsini and Bishop Carrera are waiting, anxious.\n\n\"Come. Both of you. Witness what we decree.\" The Pope's voice fills the chamber with certainty it hasn't held in years. \"Send word to Cardinal Orsini's secretary - summon the cardinals who are loyal. We have proclamations to make.\"\n\nAs the two clergy hurry to obey, Pope Eugenius turns back to you. His eyes are still wet with tears, but they're different tears now. Not despair - gratitude.\n\n\"God sent you to Granada to complete the Reconquista. But He also sent you here, now, for me. For Rome. For the Church. You don't see it yet because your faith is too pure to recognize its own power. But we see it. You gave us back our certainty.\"\n\nOne Hour Later - Formal Audience Chamber\n\nTwenty-three cardinals are assembled - all those in Rome known to support Pope Eugenius against Basel's claims. Cardinal Orsini stands at the Pope's right hand. You stand before them.\n\nPope Eugenius speaks, his voice carrying across the chamber:\n\n\"We, Eugenius, servant of the servants of God, do hereby decree and proclaim:\n\n\"First, that His Majesty King Juan II of Castile is released from his crusade oath with the highest honors. His service to Christ and His Church stands as example to all Christian monarchs of what papal authority accomplishes when exercised righteously and obeyed faithfully.\n\n\"Second, that the Military Orders of Santiago, Calatrava, and AlcÃ¡ntara shall henceforth belong under perpetual royal control of the Crown of Castile. This grant is made in recognition of the completion of the Reconquista and shall bind all future popes.\n\n\"Third, that we support and endorse the claim of King Alfonso V of AragÃ³n to the Kingdom of Naples against all challengers. We shall write to the monarchs of Christendom explaining the justice of this claim and urging their support.\n\n\"Fourth, that when His Majesty travels to Basel to witness the Council's proceedings, he speaks with our blessing and carries our confidence. His delegation has argued theology with wisdom. His presence will remind the Council fathers what truly matters in their debates.\"\n\nHe pauses, looking directly at you. \"We have fought alone for three years. We fight no longer alone. Castile stands with Rome. Rome stands with Castile. Let all Christendom witness this alliance, forged not in politics but in shared faith.\"\n\nThe cardinals burst into applause - genuine, enthusiastic. Cardinal Orsini is weeping again. Several others wipe their eyes.\n\nAs the formal session concludes, Cardinal Orsini approaches you quietly. \"Your Majesty, what happened in that private chamber... His Holiness is transformed. We haven't seen him speak with such certainty since his election. You gave him something he desperately needed - not military support or political alliance, but belief that he's not fighting for his own pride. That papal authority still matters to someone.\"\n\nHe glances around, lowers his voice further. \"This will create reactions. The Basel-supporting cardinals in Rome will report this immediately. The Colonna family will see this as the Pope gaining a powerful foreign ally. Emperor Sigismund arrives in five weeks - he'll need to account for this new alliance in his mediation efforts.\"\n\nHe smiles. \"But for now, let us simply be grateful. The Holy Father needed hope. You gave it to him.\"\n\nThat Evening - Your Quarters in Vatican Guest Chambers\n\nThe crusaders are quartered throughout Vatican properties and nearby monasteries. The treasury and relics are secured under guard in Vatican vaults. Don Bernat de Centelles finds you as evening falls.\n\n\"Your Majesty, word of today's events is spreading through Rome like wildfire. The proclamations about the Military Orders and Naples support - King Alfonso will be extremely pleased. But there's more happening beneath the surface.\"\n\nHe sits, accepts wine you offer. \"I've been listening to conversations in the streets, in taverns. The Romans are calling you 'Il Re Crociato' - the Crusader King. Some see your arrival as providential for the Pope. Others...\" He hesitates. \"Others whisper that a Spanish king now controls the papacy through spiritual manipulation.\"\n\nHe takes a drink. \"The Colonna family has been quiet today. Too quiet. They control significant military force in Rome. Your eight hundred crusaders are formidable, but the Colonna have thousands of retainers if they choose to mobilize. They're watching to see what this alliance means for their feud with the Pope.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"And Basel will hear about this within days. Cardinal Cesarini presiding over the Council, your delegation arguing there, and now the Pope proclaiming you speak with his blessing? That changes the entire dynamic of the Council's debates.\"\n\nOutside your window, Rome stretches into twilight. Church bells mark evening prayers. Somewhere in this ancient city, factions are reacting to your arrival, calculating their responses, deciding whether you're ally or threat.\n\nTomorrow the Pope wants to speak with you about practical matters - the journey to Basel, the timing of your arrival there, what to say to the Council fathers. Tonight, you have time to rest, to pray, to process what happened in that private chamber.\n\nThe Reconquista is complete. Your crusade oath is fulfilled. The Military Orders belong to Castile forever. Alfonso's Naples claim has papal support.\n\nBut your role in the Church's great crisis is just beginning."

He wants to discuss Basel, the timing of your arrival there, what to expect from Cardinal Cesarini and the Council fathers.\"\n\nHe pauses at the door. \"Your Majesty, what happened today... in thirty years of service to the Holy See, I have never seen His Holiness so transformed.
