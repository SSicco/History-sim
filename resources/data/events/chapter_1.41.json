The winter sun had barely crested the horizon, painting the room in soft grays and golds. Isabel lay beside you, still sleeping, her dark hair spread across the pillow, one hand resting near her face. The covers rose and fell gently with her breathing.\n\nThe palace was already stirring beyond the door—distant footsteps in corridors, muffled voices of servants beginning their daily routines, the faint clatter of the kitchens below. But here, in these chambers, the world remained quiet. Peaceful.\n\nIsabel's eyes opened slowly, finding yours. A small smile touched her lips—genuine, unguarded. For just this moment, she was simply your wife, not the queen bearing the weight of royal expectations.\n\n\"Good morning,\" she whispered."

Juan agreed they could \"just be together for tonight\" without pressure. Now it's the morning after. The fact that Juan is choosing to be intimate again shows they're continuing to rebuild their connection.\n\nI should handle this moment with dignity, then move to the administrative/political matters that need attention. Based on Chapter 40, the urgent matters Álvaro identified were:\n1. Cortes dissolution and crusade tax accounting\n2. Sierra Nevada fortress commanders (non-responsive)\n3. Military Orders' future role\n4. Mediterranean trade delegation\n\nI should present the council meeting scenario and stop, waiting for Juan to direct the conversation.\n\nYou draw Isabel close, and she comes willingly, the nervousness of yesterday replaced by trust and acceptance. The morning intimacy is tender, unhurried—a quiet affirmation of your bond after so many months apart. When it's finished, you hold each other in the pale winter light, neither speaking, simply being together.\n\nEventually, duty calls. Isabel helps you dress, her fingers working the clasps of your doublet with familiar efficiency. Before you leave, she catches your hand.\n\n\"Tonight?\" she asks softly.\n\n\"Tonight,\" you promise, kissing her forehead.\n\nThe council chamber feels colder than your rooms, the stone walls holding winter's chill despite the fire crackling in the hearth. Álvaro is already present, along with Diego de Daza, your treasurer. They've spread documents across the long table—tax ledgers, correspondence, maps of Granada.\n\nÁlvaro rises as you enter, bowing. \"Your Majesty. I've gathered the most pressing matters as you requested. Diego has prepared the financial analysis you asked for—both crusade and crown accounts, including the new Granada revenues and seized estates.\"\n\nDiego stands as well, looking nervous but pleased. Several thick ledgers sit before him, bristling with marking ribbons.\n\n\"Where shall we begin, Your Majesty?\" Álvaro asks. \"The Sierra Nevada commanders who haven't responded? The Cortes dissolution and tax authority question? Or would you prefer Diego's financial report first?\"\n\nBoth men wait, quills at the ready, the morning sun streaming through the narrow windows to illuminate the documents spread between you."

          "text": "Juan is asking a legitimate procedural question. Let me think through the context:\n\n1. The Cortes was summoned in November 1431 in Valladolid\n2. At that Cortes, the crusade tax was approved for a minimum of two years (through December 31, 1433)\n3. The Cortes was dissolved after that meeting\n4. Juan has been campaigning for the past year (1432)\n5. Now it's November 1432\n6. Juan is asking whether he can/should summon the Cortes again\n\nThis is a good question about medieval governance. Let me have Álvaro provide historical context and practical advice.\n\nKey points:\n- Cortes meetings were not annual - they were summoned as needed by the king\n- Summoning too frequently could make the king look weak or uncertain\n- But there ARE legitimate reasons to summon Cortes (new taxes, major policy changes, distribution of conquered lands, etc.)\n- The 1431 Cortes already approved the crusade tax through end of 1433\n- Juan is asking if he could summon them again in 1433 to potentially extend it or address other matters\n\nÁlvaro should provide a nuanced answer explaining:\n1. Yes, you CAN summon Cortes whenever you want as king\n2. But there are political considerations about frequency\n3. The crusade tax authority runs through 1433, so no immediate need\n4. If you want to extend beyond 1433, you'd need to summon them in late 1433\n5. Or you could summon earlier if you have other major business (like distributing Granada lands formally, new governance structures, etc.)\n\nLet me write Álvaro's response carefully.\n\nÁlvaro exchanges a glance with Diego, then nods thoughtfully. \"A good question, Your Majesty. Let me address the practical and political dimensions.\"\n\nHe stands, moving to the window as he gathers his thoughts.\n\n\"First, the procedural answer: Yes, you can summon the Cortes whenever you wish. You are the king. There is no law restricting how frequently they may be called. Some of your predecessors summoned them multiple times in a single year when circumstances demanded it.\"\n\nHe turns back to face you.\n\n\"However, the political considerations are more delicate. The Cortes we held in Valladolid in November 1431—barely thirteen months ago—was exhausting for the nobles. They came after months of crusade service, heard demands for new taxation, witnessed three of their peers condemned. It was... intense.\"\n\nDiego adds quietly, \"Many complained about the burden of traveling to Valladolid in winter. The costs of attendance, the time away from their estates.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"Summoning them again so soon risks appearing either weak—as if you need constant approval—or tyrannical—as if you're imposing fresh demands before they've recovered from the last ones. Neither impression serves Your Majesty well.\"\n\nHe returns to the table, tapping the tax documents.\n\n\"As to the crusade tax specifically: The Cortes already approved it through December 31, 1433. That authority stands. You need not ask them again to continue collecting what they already authorized. The tax collectors have their mandate for another thirteen months.\"\n\n\"Now,\" Álvaro continues, \"if you wish to extend the crusade tax beyond 1433—say, for your eternal crusade toward Africa—then yes, you would need Cortes approval. But the practical time for that would be late 1433, perhaps October or November, giving them notice that the tax authority expires at year's end and requesting an extension.\"\n\nHe pauses, considering.\n\n\"There could be reasons to summon them earlier. If you wished to formally distribute Granada's conquered territories among the nobility—not just the battlefield grants you've already made, but a comprehensive reorganization of the kingdom's feudal structure. Or if you wanted to establish new governance institutions that require noble consent. Or if...\" He hesitates. \"If you wanted to formally address the succession question with Princess Catalina.\"\n\nDiego shifts uncomfortably at that last point.\n\n\"But,\" Álvaro concludes, \"for the simple question of continuing the crusade tax through 1433? No Cortes needed. You already have their authority. And for extending it beyond 1433? Wait until late next year when the question becomes immediate and practical.\"\n\nHe looks at you carefully. \"Does that address Your Majesty's concern? Or were you thinking of summoning them for other reasons?\""

This means converting all mosques to churches, especially the grand mosque in Grenada. \nAlso, I must bring all areas under christian rule.

          "text": "Juan is asking about:\n1. Converting mosques to churches in conquered territories\n2. The timeline and progress of these conversions\n3. Whether the Church needs help\n4. He wants to finish the crusade obligations as soon as possible\n5. He's thinking about moving to Granada this campaign season to collect oaths from the Sierra Nevada commanders\n\nThis is interesting - Juan is focused on fulfilling the literal terms of the papal bull, which required converting mosques to churches and bringing areas under Christian rule. Let me think about what would realistically be happening:\n\nThe campaign ended in November 1432. It's now November 30, 1432 - so the conquest is only about 2 weeks old in terms of Granada city itself. But many territories were conquered throughout 1431-1432.\n\nFor conversions:\n- This would be ongoing throughout conquered territories\n- The Church would have teams working on this\n- Major mosques in cities would be priorities\n- The Grand Mosque in Granada city (in the Alhambra complex) would be the ultimate symbolic prize\n- But Granada city just surrendered ~2 weeks ago, so work there would just be beginning\n\nCardinal Capranica was the Papal Legate - he would be coordinating this. Or he went back to Rome. Let me check the character database...\n\nFrom the database: \"Current Location: Rome or traveling (returned after embassy visit) [REF: Chapter_24.md implied]\"\n\nSo Capranica may have returned to Rome. But there would be other Church officials managing the conversions.\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo would be heavily involved - he's mentioned in Chapter 40 as making inquiries about succession. He would be the senior Church authority for Castile.\n\nLet me think about realistic progress:\n- Smaller mosques in towns conquered in 1431 - likely already converted\n- Major mosques in cities like Málaga, Loja, etc - probably in progress or completed\n- Granada's Grand Mosque - just beginning\n\nThis is a major undertaking requiring:\n- Physical reconsecration ceremonies\n\n- Systematic removal of Islamic architectural elements\n- Careful replacement of religious infrastructure\n\nI see the conversion process involves meticulous steps. Álvaro's network would be crucial in coordinating these efforts. The Church would deploy specialized teams to transform these sacred spaces, ensuring each mosque undergoes a comprehensive Christian transformation. Symbolic and practical changes would happen simultaneously - removing Islamic decorative elements, installing Christian iconography, and preparing the space for new liturgical practices.\n\nThe process isn't just about physical changes, but represents a profound cultural and religious transition. Each converted mosque symbolizes the expanding Christian territorial and spiritual influence.\n\nJuan's travel plans require careful interpretation. Winter presents logistical challenges, especially in mountainous regions like Sierra Nevada. The urgency of the commanders' situation might necessitate immediate action, despite typical campaign season constraints.\n\nÁlvaro's expression grows serious. He pulls several letters from the stack before him.\n\n\"The conversions are proceeding, Your Majesty, though the scale is... considerable. Let me provide specifics.\"\n\nHe spreads out a document—a list in neat script.\n\n\"The Archbishop of Toledo has coordinated with Cardinal Capranica—who returned to Rome last spring but left instructions—to systematically convert every mosque in the conquered territories. The work is organized by priority and region.\"\n\nDiego leans forward. \"The costs have been significant. Each conversion requires materials, labor, clergy...\"\n\nÁlvaro continues: \"The territories conquered in early 1431—Alcalá la Real, the eastern fortresses—their mosques were converted within weeks of capture. Perhaps forty smaller mosques total, now functioning as parish churches. The work there is complete.\"\n\nHe moves his finger down the list.\n\n\"The coastal territories taken mid-campaign—Málaga, Marbella, Vélez-Málaga, and the surrounding towns—those conversions are nearly finished. The Grand Mosque of Málaga was reconsecrated in August with great ceremony. Perhaps another sixty mosques in that region. A few smaller village mosques still awaiting consecration, but the Archbishop expects completion by year's end.\"\n\n\"The interior fortresses taken late in the campaign—Ronda, Loja, Alhama—their conversions are underway. Perhaps thirty more mosques. Should be finished by February or March.\"\n\nThen Álvaro pauses, tapping a different section of the document.\n\n\"Granada city itself... that is the challenge, Your Majesty. The city has not forty or sixty mosques, but over one hundred. Small neighborhood mosques, Friday mosques, bathhouse chapels. And then there is the Grand Mosque in the Alhambra itself—the crown jewel.\"\n\nHe looks up at you.\n\n\"The Archbishop arrived in Granada ten days ago with a team of thirty clergy and craftsmen. They began with the Grand Mosque immediately—it is the symbolic heart of Muslim Granada. The reconsecration ceremony is scheduled for Christmas Day. The Archbishop felt the symbolism important: Christ's birth celebrated in what was Islam's holiest place in Iberia.\"\n\n\"But the other mosques in Granada will take months. Perhaps until summer. The sheer number, the need for clergy to staff them afterward, the complexity of the work... The Archbishop has requested more funds and more priests. He estimates needing another 15,000 maravedís and at least forty more clergy to complete the work by summer.\"\n\nDiego adds: \"We've already spent approximately 25,000 maravedís on conversions throughout the campaign. The additional 15,000 would bring the total to 40,000—about 150 florins total for the entire effort.\"\n\nÁlvaro sets down the document.\n\n\"As for your second question—moving toward Granada to secure the Sierra Nevada fortresses—when were you thinking of departing, Your Majesty? The campaign season traditionally ends in October, and we are now entering December. The mountain passes will be difficult in winter. Or did you mean to wait until spring?\"\n\nHe watches you carefully, clearly wondering whether you intend immediate winter action or are planning ahead for the spring campaign season of 1433."

He's asking for confirmation that all mosque conversions will be done by summer 1433, assuming all remaining areas surrender\n\nÁlvaro should confirm this understanding and potentially note:\n- The timeline depends on the Sierra Nevada fortresses surrendering\n- If they resist and must be taken by force, that could delay things\n- The Christmas Day reconsecration of Granada's Grand Mosque is a major milestone\n- The Archbishop needs the additional funds and clergy to meet the summer timeline\n- There may be practical questions about what \"done\" means - physical conversion vs. having clergy to staff all these new churches\n\nI should keep this response focused and relatively short - just confirming the timeline and addressing any practical questions.\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"Yes, Your Majesty. If all goes according to plan—and if those Sierra Nevada fortresses submit peacefully as we expect—the Archbishop believes all mosque conversions will be complete by summer 1433. Probably June or July at the latest.\"\n\nHe taps the document again. \"The Christmas Day reconsecration of Granada's Grand Mosque will be the great symbolic moment. After that, it becomes methodical work—converting the remaining neighborhood mosques throughout the city and in the outlying territories.\"\n\nDiego interjects carefully: \"The Archbishop did request those additional funds, Your Majesty. The 15,000 maravedís for materials and the forty additional priests. Without them, the work might stretch into autumn instead of summer.\"\n\n\"A reasonable request,\" Álvaro adds. \"150 florins total for the entire conversion effort across all Granada's territories—considering we're converting over two hundred mosques—is actually quite modest. The Archbishop has been efficient.\"\n\nHe pauses, then continues. \"Once the physical conversions are complete, there remains the question of staffing. Finding Spanish-speaking priests for over two hundred new parish churches will take time. Many will initially be served by traveling clergy until permanent priests can be assigned. But the actual conversion—the physical transformation and reconsecration—yes, summer 1433.\"\n\nÁlvaro looks at you directly. \"So you plan to remain in Toledo through year's end? That gives us six weeks to address domestic matters. The Sierra Nevada situation, the financial reforms Diego has prepared, the tax enforcement we discussed yesterday with the Duke ultimatums...\"\n\nHe glances at the stack of documents. \"We have much to accomplish before you must march again in spring.\""

This would attract significant attention and recruitment.\n\nFactors FOR high recruitment:\n- Complete conquest of Granada (710-year Reconquista completed)\n- Plenary indulgence (forgiveness of sins)\n- Touching sacred relics (True Cross fragment, Santiago's bone)\n- Substantial land rewards promised\n- Monthly wages (2 maravedís/day)\n- 200 maravedí bonus\n- 50-100 acres promised\n- Juan's personal charisma and divine protection reputation\n- Spectacular battlefield successes\n- News spreading throughout Christendom\n- Papal backing and legitimacy\n\nFactors AGAINST unlimited recruitment:\n- Must serve until crusade complete - long commitment\n- Can't leave before completion\n- Dangerous combat\n- Separation from families\n- Commanders may limit size to maintain quality and cohesion\n- Need to maintain discipline and organization\n- Limited officer capacity to manage\n- Supply and logistics constraints\n\nHistorically, major crusades could attract thousands.

The recruitment in Toledo had been extraordinary—over 300 volunteered in a single afternoon after seeing the banner and hearing your speech.\"\n\nHe flips through more pages.\n\n\"Since then, recruitment has continued throughout the campaign. Fray Hernando has maintained the Guardian Company's standards rigorously—every recruit must take the oath before the banner and relics, must be examined for spiritual fitness, must commit until Granada is conquered. The standards have remained high.\"\n\nDiego leans forward. \"The costs have been significant, Your Majesty. Each crusader receives 60 maravedís monthly, plus the 200 maravedí bonus upon completing service, plus the promised land grants. With hundreds of men over twenty-one months of campaign...\"\n\nÁlvaro raises a hand. \"But the commitment has remained absolute. These men cannot leave. They serve until released.

The outcome will depend on many factors—the news spreading, the standards maintained, whether the commanders actively limited growth to preserve cohesion and quality.\"\n\nWhat should we consider for the assessment, Your Majesty?

This is years of service, not seasonal\n2. **High standards** - Fray Hernando's spiritual examinations filter out opportunists\n3. **Physical requirements** - Must be fit for combat\n4. **Campaign nearly over** - By late 1432, Granada is conquered. Less appeal to join when it's almost done\n5. **Organizational limits** - Commanders may deliberately limit size to maintain cohesion, quality, and logistics\n6. **Geographic distance** - Hard for distant recruits to reach Spain\n7. **Cost consciousness** - More crusaders = higher payroll. Diego and Álvaro may have advised limiting growth\n8. **Competition** - Other military opportunities exist\n9. **Deaths/casualties** - Some original crusaders killed in combat over 21 months\n\nI'll calculate potential crusader numbers, considering the harsh realities of medieval military recruitment. Starting with around 575 crusaders, the campaign would likely see significant attrition. Medieval military commitments were incredibly challenging, with most men unable to leave families for extended periods. The restrictive spiritual and physical requirements would further limit recruitment, making substantial numerical growth unlikely.\n\nMy analysis suggests recruitment would follow a nuanced pattern. Low-end scenarios might attract 600-800 total crusaders, with commanders carefully selecting participants. Mid-range recruitment could stabilize around 1,200-1,800, balancing commitment challenges against the compelling narrative of potential success. Higher recruitment scenarios become possible if spectacular early victories or sacred relics generate widespread enthusiasm, potentially pushing total numbers to 2,500-3,500 dedicated crusaders.\n\nGM MODE: D100 CRUSADER RECRUITMENT ASSESSMENT\n\nLet me evaluate the success and failure factors realistically for crusader recruitment over the 21-month campaign (March 1431 - November 1432).\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nSpectacular military victory - Complete conquest of Granada, ending 710-year Reconquista. This is MASSIVE news across Christendom. Biggest Christian military success in generations.\n\nSacred relics - True Cross fragment and Santiago's bone. For medieval Christians, these are extraordinarily powerful spiritual draws.\n\nPlenary indulgence - Full remission of sins is enormous motivation in this era.\n\nConcrete rewards - 60 maravedís/month + 200 maravedí bonus + land grants (50-100 acres). Real economic opportunity.\n\nRoyal prestige - Juan II is now famous - young king who conquered Granada at age 20.\n\nTime for news to spread - 21 months for word to reach Italy, France, Germany and for recruits to arrive.\n\nVictory momentum - Each major victory (Málaga, Loja, Granada city) generates recruitment waves.\n\nStrong base - Started with 550-600 already sworn by February 1431.\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nAbsolute commitment required - Cannot leave until crusade complete. This is potentially YEARS of service, not 40 days. Extremely restrictive - most men have families, farms, obligations.\n\nHigh standards maintained - Fray Hernando's spiritual examinations filter out opportunists and mercenaries. Not everyone who volunteers is accepted.\n\nCampaign nearly complete by late 1432 - Less appeal to join when Granada already fallen. \"I came for the crusade but it's already over.\"\n\nOrganizational limits - Commanders (Fray Hernando, Fernán, Juan) may deliberately cap size to maintain:\nUnit cohesion and quality\n\nLogistical manageability\n\nSpiritual character (not just becoming mercenary company)\n\nCombat casualties - 21 months of active warfare. Realistic attrition of 10-20% killed, seriously wounded, or invalided out.\n\nCost concerns - Each crusader costs 720 maravedís/year in wages alone. Diego may advise limiting growth.\n\nGeographic barriers - Getting from Italy/France to Spain takes weeks. Expensive journey.\n\nCompeting opportunities - Other wars, local obligations, family needs.\n\nD100 TABLE: CRUSADER RECRUITMENT OUTCOME\n\nStarting Position (February 1431): 575 sworn crusaders\n\n01-15: LIMITED GROWTH - Organizational Caps Applied\n\nCommanders deliberately limited recruitment after ~800-900 total\n\nFray Hernando insisted on maintaining spiritual character\n\n\"We are crusaders, not a mercenary company\"\n\nCombat casualties: ~80-120 killed/wounded over 21 months\n\nResult: 750-850 crusaders by November 1432\n\nQuality very high, cohesion excellent, but smaller force\n\n16-35: MODEST GROWTH - Commitment Scared Many Off\n\nSteady trickle of recruits but absolute commitment deterred most\n\nNews spread but \"serve until Granada falls\" was years-long proposition\n\nStandards remained high, many rejected\n\nCombat casualties: ~100-140 killed/wounded\n\nResult: 900-1,200 crusaders by November 1432\n\nSolid growth but nothing extraordinary\n\n36-55: MODERATE GROWTH - Balanced Recruitment\n\nSuccess attracted recruits, standards filtered them, commitment limited numbers\n\nThree major recruitment waves: after Málaga (June 1431), after Loja (September 1431), after Granada surrender (November 1432)\n\nCombat casualties: ~120-160 killed/wounded\n\nResult: 1,300-1,700 crusaders by November 1432\n\nRespectable force, good quality maintained\n\n56-70: STRONG GROWTH - Success Overcame Hesitation\n\nNews of Granada's conquest spread rapidly through Italy, France\n\nSacred relics' reputation grew - \"miracles witnessed\"\n\nYoung men seeking adventure and salvation\n\nSome families pooled resources to send younger sons\n\nCombat casualties: ~140-180 killed/wounded\n\nResult: 1,800-2,300 crusaders by November 1432\n\nSubstantial force, quality still high\n\n71-85: VERY STRONG GROWTH - Crusade Fever\n\nSpectacular success created genuine crusade enthusiasm\n\n\"The Reconquista is FINISHED - be part of history!\"\n\nItalian cities sent contingents (Florence, Genoa, Venice)\n\nFrench knights arrived seeking glory\n\nCommanders accepted more but maintained standards\n\nCombat casualties: ~160-200 killed/wounded\n\nResult: 2,400-2,900 crusaders by November 1432\n\nLarge, effective force with international character\n\n86-95: EXCEPTIONAL GROWTH - Wave of Faith and Glory\n\nNews reached Germany, Poland, even England\n\n\"King Juan finished what centuries couldn't - and he's only 20!\"\n\nRelics' reputation extraordinary - \"men weep touching them\"\n\nMultiple contingents from across Christendom\n\nSome commanders worried about maintaining character\n\nCombat casualties: ~180-220 killed/wounded\n\nResult: 3,000-3,500 crusaders by November 1432\n\nVery large force, still mostly high quality\n\n96-100: EXTRAORDINARY GROWTH - Crusade Becomes Legend\n\nGranada's fall triggered genuine crusade movement\n\nPope's envoys actively recruiting in Italy\n\nFrench and German princes sent knight contingents\n\n\"Join the crusade that SUCCEEDED - rare in our age\"\n\nCommanders struggled to process all volunteers\n\nSome standards relaxed to accommodate numbers\n\nCombat casualties: ~200-250 killed/wounded\n\nResult: 3,500-4,200 crusaders by November 1432\n\nMassive force, quality variable but overall strong\n\nRoll when ready. This will determine the current state of the crusader organization going into Chapter 41."

          "text": "Álvaro opens the ledger again, running his finger down the columns with a slight frown.\n\n\"Your Majesty, the numbers are... more modest than one might expect given our extraordinary success. Let me explain what happened.\"\n\nHe settles back in his chair.\n\n\"We began the campaign in March 1431 with approximately 575 sworn crusaders. Throughout the spring and summer, recruitment continued steadily. After the victory at Málaga in June, we saw a surge—perhaps fifty men arriving from Italy and southern France within two months. Another wave came after Loja fell in September. By early 1432, we had reached approximately 880-900 crusaders.\"\n\nHe pauses, tapping the page.\n\n\"But then Fray Hernando came to me with concerns. He said the character of the company was changing. Too many men arriving motivated primarily by the land grants and wages rather than genuine spiritual commitment. Men who touched the relics perfunctorily, who took the oath but didn't truly mean it. Mercenaries in crusader's clothing.\"\n\nDiego nods. \"I remember that conversation. February or March of this year.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Álvaro continues. \"Fray Hernando requested—and Captain Fernán supported—that we implement much stricter screening. The spiritual examinations became more rigorous. Many volunteers were turned away. Some who had already been provisionally accepted were rejected after deeper examination. Fray Hernando's exact words were: 'We are crusaders, not a mercenary company. Better 800 men with genuine faith than 3,000 motivated by greed.'\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"Your Majesty never countermanded that decision, so the policy stood. Throughout 1432, recruitment slowed to a trickle. Perhaps fifty more accepted over the entire year. Meanwhile...\" He turns to a different page, his expression sobering. \"Combat takes its toll. Twenty-one months of active campaigning. The siege of Málaga, the assault at Loja, dozens of smaller engagements, raids, skirmishes.\"\n\n\"We lost approximately ninety-five crusaders killed in action. Another thirty seriously wounded—lost limbs, blinded, injuries that ended their service. Perhaps fifteen more died of camp fever and dysentery. That's roughly 140 men removed from the ranks over the campaign.\"\n\nHe closes the ledger.\n\n\"The current muster, as of last week, shows 798 sworn crusaders actively serving. If we count those recovering from wounds who may return to duty, perhaps 820 total. Far fewer than we might have recruited if we'd accepted everyone who volunteered. But...\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"Fray Hernando tells me that every single one of those 798 men is genuine. They've all touched the relics with tears in their eyes. They've all maintained their vows through twenty-one months of hardship. They've all proven themselves in battle. The Guardian Company—the core fifty who protect the banner—are the most devoted warriors he's ever encountered. They would die before letting the relics fall.\"\n\nDiego adds quietly: \"The wage costs are also more manageable, Your Majesty. 798 crusaders cost about 575,000 maravedís annually in wages alone. Still substantial, but not the millions we feared if numbers had grown to several thousand.\"\n\nÁlvaro leans forward. \"So we have a smaller force than Granada's fall might have generated, but an absolutely elite one. Every man a true believer. Is that... acceptable, Your Majesty? Or would you have preferred we recruited more aggressively, even at the cost of diluting the spiritual character?\"\n\nHe waits for your response, clearly uncertain whether you'll approve of this policy that was implemented in your absence."

          "text": "1. A delegation was sent in February 1432 with detailed instructions\n2. The delegation was headed by Fray Hernando de Talavera\n3. They went with a comprehensive position on various issues\n4. It's now November 1432 - 9 months later\n\nI should check if there's any information about what happened after the delegation was sent. Let me search for more recent updates.\n\nThe search shows that the delegation was sent in February 1432, and it's now November 1432 - 9 months later. However, I don't see any information in the project files about the delegation returning or sending reports back. This means I need to determine what would have realistically happened.\n\nBasel is far from Spain - probably a 6-8 week journey each way in good conditions. The delegation would have:\n- Departed Toledo late February/early March 1432\n- Arrived at Basel probably April/May 1432\n- Spent time at the council\n- Would send reports back periodically\n- Might still be there, or might have returned\n\nGiven it's November 1432, Juan has been on campaign since March. He wouldn't have been receiving regular reports while campaigning in Granada. Any reports would have gone to Toledo or been held for his return.\n\nI should have Álvaro explain what information has come back - probably some letters, but possibly the delegation is still there or just returning now.\n\nÁlvaro nods and reaches for another leather folder from the stack. \"Basel, yes. The delegation departed in early March—Fray Hernando led it as you instructed, along with Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena and four others. They carried the comprehensive instructions we prepared after the Toledo theological council.\"\n\nHe opens the folder, revealing several letters with broken seals.\n\n\"They arrived in Basel sometime in late April or early May—it's a long journey, nearly two months overland through France. Since then, we've received three reports. The last arrived here in Toledo about six weeks ago, so it was written in late September.\"\n\nHe spreads the letters on the table.\n\n\"The first report, dated June, described their reception at Basel. Castile's position was received with considerable interest. The Council fathers were impressed that a kingdom actually winning its crusade had bothered to send a delegation at all. Most of Christendom talks about crusading; we're doing it. That gave our words weight.\"\n\n\"Fray Hernando reported that Cardinal Cesarini—the papal legate who presides over the Council—sought him out for private conversations. The Cardinal was particularly interested in your offer to assist Constantinople once Granada is secured, and in your conditional commitment regarding Bohemia if negotiations fail.\"\n\nDiego leans in. \"The Council's negotiations with the Hussites have been ongoing. Slow, complex theological discussions about those Four Articles we took positions on.\"\n\nÁlvaro continues: \"The second report, dated July, was more detailed. Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena gave a formal address to the assembled prelates outlining Castile's positions. According to Fray Hernando, it was very well received—particularly our stance on church reform. We acknowledged corruption honestly while insisting reform must come through proper church authority, not capitulation to heretical demands.\"\n\n\"The third report, from September, noted that the dispute between Pope Eugenius IV and the Council has intensified. The Pope attempted to dissolve the Council and move it to Italy; the Council refused and declared itself superior to the papacy in certain matters. It's... tense. Castile's delegation has been walking a careful line—maintaining respect for both papal authority and conciliar legitimacy.\"\n\nHe sets down the letters.\n\n\"Fray Hernando wrote that he expects to remain in Basel through year's end at least. The Hussite negotiations are at a critical stage, and your conditional military commitment gives Castile a voice at the table. He requested guidance: if the negotiations succeed and the Hussites return to communion, should he formally confirm that your Bohemia commitment is withdrawn? Or does Your Majesty wish to maintain pressure by keeping the option open?\"\n\nÁlvaro looks at you carefully. \"We haven't received anything since September. The delegation may have sent more recent reports that haven't reached us yet, or they may be awaiting developments before writing again. Should I send a courier to Basel with updated instructions now that Granada has fallen? The situation has changed significantly—what was a conditional 'once Granada is conquered' offer is now an immediate possibility.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"Your Majesty has just completed one crusade. Basel might be very interested to know whether you're serious about Constantinople... or whether exhaustion and domestic concerns will keep Castile focused inward for the foreseeable future.\""

          "text": "This is exciting! A d100 table to determine how the Council of Basel has responded to Castile's positions and what the overall situation is. This needs to be realistic and historical.\n\nLet me think about the success and failure factors for Castile's positions being adopted or influential at Basel:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n1. Castile is actually WINNING a crusade - unprecedented in this era. Five crusades against Bohemia failed. Most crusades are disasters. Castile's success gives moral authority.\n2. Juan II is young, dynamic, blessed by the late Pope Martin V personally\n3. Castilian positions are nuanced and balanced - not extreme. They acknowledge both papal authority and conciliar legitimacy, support reform while maintaining church structure\n4. Fray Hernando is compelling speaker and Juan's personal confessor - carries weight\n5. Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena is renowned scholar of canon law\n6. Castile offers tangible military support (Constantinople, potentially Bohemia) - not just words\n7. The positions on the Four Articles of Prague are sophisticated - supporting vernacular scripture and communion in both kinds (moderate Hussite demands) while rejecting confiscation and unlimited secular punishment\n8. Cardinal Cesarini (presiding over Basel) seems interested in Castilian positions\n9. Castile has no factional axe to grind - not aligned with either extreme papal or extreme conciliar faction\n10. The example of successful reform through proper authority (crusade taxation, crown oversight by Capranica) demonstrates reform can work\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n1. Castile is geographically remote - Iberian kingdom, not central European power\n2. The Council is deeply divided between pro-papal and pro-conciliar factions - hard to build consensus\n3. Pope Eugenius IV vs. Council is becoming irreconcilable conflict - neutrality may be impossible\n4. Hussite negotiations are incredibly complex - decades of conflict, theological subtleties\n5. Major powers (France, Holy Roman Empire) have their own agendas and may not want Spanish influence\n\n6. Some may see Castile's balanced position as fence-sitting rather than principled\n7. The offer to help Constantinople is conditional on \"once Granada complete\" - was vague, now realized but commitment unclear\n8. Bohemia commitment is explicitly conditional on negotiations failing - might be seen as weak\n9. Internal Council politics may override any outside delegation's influence\n10. The Basel-Eugenius dispute has hardened positions - moderates losing ground\n\nI recognize the nuanced challenges facing Castile's diplomatic efforts. The delegation walks a delicate line between principled mediation and potential perceived weakness. Their sophisticated approach could be misinterpreted as indecision, especially given the complex political landscape of the Council of Basel. The conditional nature of their military and diplomatic offers might undermine their credibility, despite their genuine attempts at balanced negotiation.\n\nThe geopolitical tensions and internal fractures of the Council create a treacherous environment where even well-intentioned interventions can be easily misunderstood or dismissed. Castile's remote position and lack of direct European power dynamics further complicate their ability to influence the proceedings decisively.\n\nGM MODE: D100 BASEL COUNCIL OUTCOME TABLE\n\nLet me evaluate the success and failure factors for Castile's positions at the Council of Basel:\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nActual crusade victory - Castile is the ONLY Christian kingdom winning a crusade in this generation. Five crusades against Bohemia failed. This gives unprecedented moral authority.\n\nPersonal papal blessing - Juan II received Pope Martin V's personal endorsement and sacred relics. This carries weight.\n\nBalanced, moderate positions - Castile acknowledged both papal authority and conciliar legitimacy, supported reform without extremism.\n\nTangible military commitment - Offers to help Constantinople and potentially Bohemia are real, not just diplomatic platitudes.\n\nQuality delegation - Fray Hernando (Juan's confessor) and Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena (renowned canon law scholar) are impressive representatives.\n\nSophisticated theology - Castilian positions on Four Articles show genuine engagement with issues, not just rejection.\n\nPractical example - Castile demonstrates reform can work (crusade taxation with church oversight successfully implemented).\n\nCardinal Cesarini's interest - The Council's presiding legate sought out Fray Hernando personally.\n\nNo factional agenda - Castile isn't aligned with extreme papal or extreme conciliar factions, can be honest broker.\n\nGranada completed - What was conditional (\"once Granada conquered\") is now reality, making commitments immediate.\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nGeographic remoteness - Iberia is far from Basel. Central European powers (France, Empire, Italian states) dominate.\n\nDeep Council divisions - Pope Eugenius IV vs. Council is becoming irreconcilable. Moderate voices being drowned out.\n\nComplex Hussite situation - Decades of conflict, theological subtleties, Czech nationalism, German resentment. Outside mediation difficult.\n\nMajor power politics - France and Holy Roman Empire have their own agendas, may resent Spanish influence.\n\nPapal-Conciliar split intensifying - Basel declared itself superior to Pope on certain matters. Positions hardening.\n\nBohemia commitment is conditional - Only if negotiations fail. Some see this as weak or threatening rather than principled.\n\nConstantinople commitment vague - \"Stand ready to provide assistance\" isn't concrete military plan.\n\nSmall delegation - Only six delegates vs. dozens from major powers.\n\nLimited financial leverage - Castile can't bribe or fund Council operations like wealthier states.\n\nTime factor - Delegation only arrived April/May 1432, only 7-8 months of influence before this assessment.\n\nD100 TABLE: BASEL COUNCIL RESPONSE TO CASTILE\n\n01-10: DISMISSED AND IGNORED\n\nCastilian positions received politely but had no real influence\n\nMajor powers (France, Empire) dominated discussions, Iberian delegation marginalized\n\nHussite negotiations collapsed or deadlocked\n\nPope-Council split became complete schism\n\nCorrespondence is formal but cold: \"Thank you for your participation, we will inform you of developments\"\n\nRequest that Castile choose a side in papal-conciliar conflict\n\nNo adoption of Castilian positions on any issue\n\n11-25: MINIMAL INFLUENCE\n\nCastilian delegation heard respectfully but positions not adopted\n\nBasel politics dominated by factional conflict between papal and conciliar extremes\n\nModerates like Castile couldn't bridge divide\n\nHussite negotiations ongoing but stalled\n\nCorrespondence polite: acknowledges Castile's unique position but notes limited impact\n\nRequest for clarification on military commitments now that Granada fallen\n\nPerhaps one minor Castilian suggestion incorporated into broader decree\n\n26-40: LIMITED BUT RESPECTFUL ENGAGEMENT\n\nCastilian positions noted and referenced in debates\n\nBishop Alfonso's address praised for theological sophistication\n\nBut Council too divided for Castilian moderation to gain traction\n\nHussite negotiations in delicate phase, outcome uncertain\n\nCorrespondence respectful: Fray Hernando's counsel valued even if not adopted\n\nRequest for continued engagement and possible military support for Council positions\n\nCastile seen as honest but relatively powerless broker\n\n41-55: MODERATE INFLUENCE - RESPECTED VOICE\n\nCastilian delegation gained respect as principled moderate faction\n\nCardinal Cesarini and other moderates cite Castilian positions approvingly\n\nSome Castilian arguments incorporated into Council decrees on reform\n\nHussite negotiations progressing partially due to Castilian example of successful crusading\n\nCorrespondence warm: appreciation for Castile's balanced approach\n\nRequest for concrete details on Constantinople assistance now Granada complete\n\nCastile asked to mediate between papal and conciliar factions\n\n2-3 Castilian positions partially adopted in Council resolutions\n\n56-70: SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE - KEY MODERATE VOICE\n\nCastilian delegation became important moderate faction bridging extremes\n\nCardinal Cesarini privately consults Fray Hernando on difficult issues\n\nCastilian positions on church reform cited frequently in debates\n\nHussite negotiations advanced significantly, some Articles partially resolved\n\nCorrespondence enthusiastic: Castile's successful crusade used as example repeatedly\n\nUrgent request for Constantinople military support with specific Byzantine embassy\n\nRequest that Juan II personally attend Basel to add weight to moderate faction\n\n3-5 Castilian positions substantially adopted in Council decrees\n\n71-85: MAJOR INFLUENCE - CASTILE AS EXAMPLE\n\n\"The kingdom that won its crusade\" became rallying cry for reform faction\n\nCastilian model of accountability with church oversight adopted as reform template\n\nFray Hernando's theological arguments cited in official Council documents\n\nHussite negotiations breakthrough: moderate Articles (vernacular scripture, communion) accepted\n\nPope-Council relations stabilized somewhat due to moderate voices including Castile\n\nCorrespondence excited: \"Your success proves reform and crusading can coexist!\"\n\nMultiple requests: Constantinople support, possible Bohemia mission, Juan II's personal attendance\n\n5-7 Castilian positions substantially incorporated into Council positions\n\nBasel offers Juan II formal recognition as \"Defender of the Faith\" title\n\n86-95: EXTRAORDINARY INFLUENCE - CASTILIAN MODEL ADOPTED\n\nCastile's balanced approach became Council's official position on papal-conciliar relations\n\nBishop Alfonso's theological framework adopted for Hussite resolution\n\nBreakthrough in Hussite negotiations: Prague Compactata signed based partly on Castilian positions\n\nPope Eugenius IV and Council reached compromise influenced by Castilian mediation\n\nCorrespondence celebratory: \"God has used Castile as instrument of unity!\"\n\nFormal invitation for Juan II to attend as honored guest and speaker\n\nRequest for detailed military assistance to Constantinople with Castilian command\n\nByzantine Emperor personally writes to Juan II requesting aid\n\n7-10 Castilian positions form core of Council reform agenda\n\nDiscussion of making Juan II papal standard-bearer for all crusades\n\n96-100: TRANSFORMATIVE INFLUENCE - CASTILIAN RENAISSANCE\n\nCastile's success triggered fundamental rethinking of how church reform and crusading work\n\nCouncil united around Castilian model: strong church authority with genuine accountability\n\nHussite conflict resolved through Prague Compactata based substantially on Castilian positions\n\nPope-Council reconciliation achieved with Castilian delegation as key mediators\n\nCardinal Cesarini proposes Juan II as supreme commander of united Christian forces against Ottomans\n\nCorrespondence ecstatic: \"God has raised Castile as beacon for all Christendom!\"\n\nMultiple European kingdoms request Castilian advisors to reform their crusade efforts\n\nFormal Council decree: Juan II named \"Champion of Christ\" and given command authority over all crusades\n\nByzantine Emperor offers unprecedented honors and alliance\n\nCastilian positions form foundation of Basel's entire reform program\n\nDiscussion of Juan II as possible future Holy Roman Emperor candidate\n\nRoll when ready.

I write with gratitude and some urgency to report developments.\n\nSince my last letter in September, much has transpired. The tensions between His Holiness Pope Eugenius IV and the assembled prelates at Basel have not lessened—indeed, they have intensified. The Holy Father continues to insist the Council should relocate to Italy; the Council fathers continue to refuse. It pains me to witness this division in Christ's Church, yet I report it faithfully.\n\nIn this fractured environment, Castile's voice has gained unexpected weight. We are one of the few delegations that both papal loyalists and conciliar reformers will speak with openly. Cardinal Cesarini—the papal legate who presides here—has sought my counsel privately on three occasions. He sees in Your Majesty's crusade what many here seek: proof that reform and orthodoxy, papal authority and accountability, can coexist rather than conflict.\n\nBishop Alfonso de Cartagena delivered a second formal address to the Council in September, expanding upon our positions regarding church reform. His argument—that the Church must acknowledge its failures honestly while reforming through proper authority rather than capitulation to external pressure—was met with sustained applause from moderates of both factions. Several prelates cited his words in subsequent debates.\n\nMore significantly, Your Majesty, portions of Castile's positions have been incorporated into Council decrees. The reform document issued in October regarding episcopal accountability cites Castilian practice explicitly: \"As demonstrated by the Kingdom of Castile, effective church oversight need not diminish papal authority but rather strengthens it by ensuring Christ's Church reflects His righteousness.\" This language comes directly from Bishop Alfonso's address.\n\nSimilarly, in the ongoing negotiations with the Bohemian representatives, our positions on vernacular scripture have been referenced repeatedly. The fact that Castile—a kingdom that just conquered the last Muslim realm in Iberia—supports making God's Word accessible in languages the faithful understand carries enormous weight. It undermines the Hussite claim that only heretics favor such reforms.\n\nI must report, however, that the Hussite negotiations remain delicate. Progress has been made on certain Articles—particularly regarding vernacular scripture and more frequent communion. But the questions of church property and clerical accountability remain contentious. The negotiations continue.\n\nCardinal Cesarini has asked me directly to convey a request: Now that Granada has fallen—glory to God!—is Your Majesty's commitment to assist Constantinople still operative? The Byzantine Emperor sent an embassy to Basel in September, desperately seeking military aid against the Ottoman advance. The Cardinal asked whether Castile's conditional offer might now become concrete.\n\nI told him I could not speak for Your Majesty on military matters without explicit authorization, but that your word, once given, is sacred. He seemed satisfied with this answer but clearly hopes for more definitive commitment.\n\nThere is another matter, more delicate. Several moderate prelates—including Cardinal Cesarini, the Archbishop of Milan, and the Bishop of Basel himself—have privately suggested that Your Majesty might consider attending the Council in person. They believe your presence could help bridge the papal-conciliar divide. As the king who successfully completed a crusade blessed by Pope Martin V, yet who also supports measured reform, you represent what many here seek: a path between the extremes.\n\nI offer no counsel on this suggestion, Your Majesty. It would require traveling to Basel, leaving the kingdom for months, and entering into the complex politics of church governance. But I report it faithfully so you may consider.\n\nOur delegation remains here through year's end at minimum. Brother Tomás has been particularly effective in private conversations with the Hussite representatives—his Franciscan simplicity appeals to their emphasis on humble faith. Bishop Alfonso continues to command respect in formal theological debates. We serve as best we can.\n\nI close with this observation: Castile's influence here derives entirely from Your Majesty's actions, not our words. It is because you actually conquered Granada, because your crusade succeeded where five crusades against Bohemia failed, because you implemented church oversight of taxation rather than simply taking what you wished—it is these deeds that give our positions weight. Talk is abundant at Basel. Faithful action is rare. This is why they listen to Castile.\n\nMay God continue to guide Your Majesty's path.\n\nYour humble servant in Christ,\nFray Hernando de Talavera\n\nÁlvaro sets down the first letter and opens the second, this one sealed with an ornate cardinal's seal.\n\nLETTER FROM CARDINAL GIULIANO CESARINI\nPapal Legate, Council of Basel\nBasel, October 20, 1432\n\nTo His Majesty Juan II, by the Grace of God King of Castile and León, Victor of Granada,\n\nYour Majesty's delegation has brought both wisdom and hope to our deliberations. In these troubled times, when the unity of Christ's Church is strained, Castile stands as proof that faithful crusading and honest reform can coexist.\n\nI write with two purposes. First, to express the Council's profound gratitude for your thoughtful engagement with these difficult questions. Your positions on church reform—acknowledging our failures while insisting on proper authority—have become a touchstone for moderate voices seeking paths between factional extremes. The document citing Castilian practice as model was supported by prelates of both papal and conciliar sympathies. This is no small achievement.\n\nSecond, to request Your Majesty's guidance on practical matters now that Granada's conquest is complete. The Byzantine Emperor John VIII Palaiologos has sent an embassy led by the scholar George Scholarios, desperately seeking military assistance against the Ottoman advance. Constantinople's situation grows more dire by the month.\n\nYour commitment—offered through your delegation—to \"stand ready to provide military assistance to Constantinople once the Granada crusade is successfully concluded\" is now relevant in immediate terms. The Council would be most grateful to know: What form might such assistance take? What timeline does Your Majesty envision? What conditions or coordination would Castile require?\n\nI do not ask for binding commitments without proper consultation. But any indication of Castile's intentions would profoundly influence both the Byzantine negotiations and the broader question of whether Christendom can mount effective defense of our Eastern brothers.\n\nThere is another matter I raise with some hesitation. Several prelates have suggested that Your Majesty's personal attendance at Basel might help bridge the painful divisions we face. You possess unique moral authority—blessed by Pope Martin V personally, yet committed to honest reform; victorious in crusade, yet humble before God's Church. Your presence might create space for reconciliation that words alone cannot achieve.\n\nI make no demand, only inform Your Majesty of this sentiment. The journey would be long, the politics complex, and the time away from your kingdom substantial. Yet if Your Majesty felt called to such service, the Council would receive you with great honor.\n\nMay God's grace continue to attend your reign.\n\nIn Christ's service,\nCardinal Giuliano Cesarini\nPapal Legate to the Council of Basel\n\nÁlvaro sets down the second letter and picks up the third, smaller and sealed with simpler wax.\n\nBRIEF NOTE FROM BISHOP ALFONSO DE CARTAGENA\nBasel, October 19, 1432\n\nYour Majesty,\n\nFray Hernando's letter will convey the substance. I add only this observation: the Bohemian representatives were profoundly affected by news of Granada's fall. They asked me directly whether it was true that a Christian king had completed the Reconquista at age twenty. When I confirmed it, one of them—a former Hussite military commander named Jan Roháč—said: \"Then perhaps God has not abandoned the cause of Christian arms entirely. We had begun to believe that only heretics could fight effectively.\"\n\nThis matters, Your Majesty. For a decade, Bohemia has defeated every Catholic crusade sent against them. They interpreted these victories as divine vindication. Your success in Granada undermines that interpretation. It suggests that perhaps their victories came not from superior theology but from superior tactics and motivation—things that can be matched.\n\nThe implied threat of Castilian intervention if negotiations fail carries far more weight now than when we first arrived. They know you can actually do what you promise.\n\nYour servant,\nAlfonso de Cartagena, Bishop of Burgos\n\nÁlvaro arranges the three letters before you.\n\n\"So, Your Majesty: Castile's positions are being cited and partially adopted. Cardinal Cesarini is asking for concrete details on Constantinople. And there's this suggestion—from multiple sources—that you might personally attend Basel.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"What guidance should I send to the delegation? And what answer, if any, should we give regarding Constantinople?\""

I think I should travel to Rome and present the entire crusade treasury along with the relics to the pope. This money is not mine anyway and should return to the church. But it gives me the chance to stress that this money does not beling to the personal belongings of the pope either. It was donated to fund campains for christian conquest and defence of christian lands. \nVisiting Rome also gives me the chance to petition the pope to grant me control over the military orders now the crusade is finished.\n\n\nIm unsure ion what order I should visit these locations.

          "text": "1. Juan wants to travel to both Basel and Rome\n2. He wants to return the sacred relics to Rome\n3. He wants to offer crusaders the chance to make pilgrimage with him\n4. He wants to return the entire crusade treasury to the Church (but emphasize it's for crusading purposes, not papal personal use)\n5. He wants to petition for permanent control over the Military Orders\n\nThis is extremely significant. The order matters a lot:\n\n**If Rome first:**\n- Returns relics and treasury while Granada victory is fresh\n- Can negotiate Military Orders control before Basel\n- Then arrives at Basel with papal backing and authority\n- Shows respect for papal authority first\n- But Basel might interpret this as choosing Pope over Council\n\n**If Basel first:**\n- Shows commitment to church reform and conciliar process\n- Arrives as crusade victor with relics and treasury still in hand\n- Can mediate Pope-Council dispute as neutral party\n- Then goes to Rome to conclude crusade officially\n- Shows independence from papal faction\n- But Pope might see this as disrespect or alignment with Council\n\nThe crusade treasury is interesting - according to Chapter 40, the crusade treasury has about 368,000 florins. That's an ENORMOUS sum to return to the Church. This is a major gesture.\n\nThe Military Orders question is complex - the crusade is technically over with Granada conquered, so the papal authority to appoint their Masters expires. Juan needs papal authorization to maintain control.\n\nLet me have Álvaro analyze this strategic question properly. This is too important for a simple answer. Álvaro would think through all the implications.\n\nÁlvaro's eyes widen. He sets down the letters and leans back in his chair, clearly processing the magnitude of what you've just proposed.\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" He pauses, collecting his thoughts. \"This is... extraordinarily bold. And potentially transformative. But the order and execution matter enormously. Let me think through this carefully.\"\n\nHe stands and walks to the window, hands clasped behind his back.\n\n\"First, the substance of what you're proposing. Returning the sacred relics to Rome—appropriate and respectful. The crusade is complete; they should rest in the Vatican treasury or be enshrined appropriately. Bringing the crusaders as pilgrimage and guard—brilliant. These men swore oaths before those relics. Allowing them to complete their service by returning the relics to the Holy Father himself? That's... profoundly fitting.\"\n\nHe turns back to face you.\n\n\"The crusade treasury. Your Majesty, we're speaking of approximately 368,000 florins. That's an almost inconceivable sum to simply give to the Church. But the strategic implications...\" He shakes his head in something like awe. \"No Christian monarch in living memory has voluntarily returned crusade funds to the Church. Most kings find excuses to keep them. Your father—forgive me—would have kept every maravedí.\"\n\n\"By returning it with the explicit stipulation that it's for crusading purposes, not papal personal use, you achieve several things: You demonstrate extraordinary piety and trustworthiness. You create moral authority to petition for the Military Orders. You show Rome and Basel both that you're not motivated by greed. And you establish that this money should fund Constantinople's defense or other crusades—which positions you to potentially lead those efforts.\"\n\nDiego interjects quietly: \"Your Majesty, the crown treasury still has approximately 189,000 florins. We're not left destitute. And the annual revenues are now strong enough to sustain the kingdom. You can afford this gesture.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"The Military Orders question is critical. Once Granada fell, your papal authority to appoint their Masters technically expired. They've fulfilled their crusading mandate. If you don't secure permanent control now, they revert to papal appointment—which means the next pope could install Masters hostile to you, or the Orders could fracture into political factions again.\"\n\n\"Petitioning the Holy Father for permanent royal authority over the Military Orders, after returning 368,000 florins and completing the Reconquista? He'd be a fool to refuse. It's generous compensation for unprecedented success.\"\n\nHe returns to the table, placing both hands on it.\n\n\"But the order, Your Majesty. That's the crucial question. Let me lay out both options:\"\n\nOPTION ONE: ROME FIRST, THEN BASEL\n\n\"You travel to Rome first. You return the relics with appropriate ceremony. You present the crusade treasury—all 368,000 florins—with the stipulation about crusading purposes. You petition for permanent control of the Military Orders. Pope Eugenius IV receives you as the conquering hero, blesses you, likely grants your petition enthusiastically.\"\n\n\"Then you travel to Basel, arriving with fresh papal approval and the moral authority of having returned a fortune to the Church. You can mediate between Pope and Council from a position of demonstrated papal loyalty but proven independence—after all, you just stipulated how he can use the money.\"\n\nAdvantages:\n\nShows respect for papal authority first\n\nSecures Military Orders control before Basel politics complicate it\n\nArrive at Basel as papal ally who also supports reform\n\nPope Eugenius grateful and supportive\n\nLess risk of seeming to choose Council over Pope\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nBasel's radical conciliarists might see you as papal faction member\n\nTiming might make you arrive at Basel after key votes\n\nCould be interpreted as needing papal permission before engaging Council\n\nSome reformers might distrust you as \"Pope's man\"\n\nOPTION TWO: BASEL FIRST, THEN ROME\n\n\"You travel to Basel first, while still carrying the sacred relics and crusade treasury. You arrive as the victorious crusader-king, the man who actually succeeded where others failed. You participate in Council deliberations, mediate between factions, lend your moral authority to reconciliation efforts.\"\n\n\"Then you travel to Rome to conclude your crusade formally. You return the relics and treasury as the final act of your crusade vow. You petition for the Military Orders from a position of having just helped the Church at Basel. The Pope sees you've been working for church unity, not faction.\"\n\nAdvantages:\n\nShows independence and commitment to church reform first\n\nParticipate in Basel at critical moment\n\nAppear as neutral mediator, not papal partisan\n\nReformers trust you more\n\nCan influence Basel outcomes directly before reporting to Pope\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nPope Eugenius might see this as disrespect or Council alignment\n\nRadical conciliarists might pressure you to take harder anti-papal stance\n\nMilitary Orders petition might be complicated by Basel politics\n\nRisk of alienating Rome before securing key concession\n\nTraveling with relics and treasury through Council territory creates security concerns\n\nÁlvaro straightens up.\n\n\"Your Majesty, my counsel: Rome first. Here's why:\"\n\n\"One: The relics belong to Rome. They were loaned for the crusade. Returning them directly and promptly shows respect and fulfills your obligation.\"\n\n\"Two: The Military Orders question is too important to risk. Secure that papal grant before Basel politics complicate matters. Once you have it in writing, sealed and witnessed, no Council decree can undo it.\"\n\n\"Three: You don't need Basel to trust you completely—you need them to listen. Arriving with fresh papal blessing but proven independence (you just told the Pope how to use his money) makes you a credible mediator, not a papal puppet.\"\n\n\"Four: Timeline matters. Rome is closer—you can complete that business in perhaps six weeks total. Then travel to Basel for the critical negotiations, probably arriving in February or March. The Council will continue through spring at least. You'll be there when it matters most.\"\n\n\"Five: Pope Eugenius is in a weak position politically. Granting you the Military Orders costs him nothing—they're Spanish Orders he can't effectively control anyway—but gains him a powerful ally who just demonstrated extraordinary loyalty. He'll be grateful and generous.\"\n\nDiego adds: \"The crusaders who accompany you to Rome can be offered the choice to continue to Basel or return home afterward. Many will want to see Basel—another holy site, another pilgrimage. But some may choose to return to Spain with their land grants. Give them the choice after Rome.\"\n\nÁlvaro looks at you intently. \"Does this counsel seem sound, Your Majesty? Or do you see considerations I've missed?\""

King of Navarre - this is complicated because it's currently Carlos (age ~11), son of Infante Juan de Aragón. He's a child, so would likely come with regent/advisors\n4. King Alfonso V of Aragon - currently in Naples, complicated relationship with Castile\n\nFor travel times to Granada:\n- From Portugal (Lisbon): ~450-500 miles, maybe 3-4 weeks travel for a royal party\n- From Navarre (Pamplona): ~400 miles, maybe 3-4 weeks\n- From Aragon/Naples: Alfonso V is in Naples, that's a huge journey - 6-8 weeks at minimum\n\nThe invitation needs to be sent, received, preparations made, then travel. For a major ceremonial event:\n- Send invitations: early December\n- Receive and respond: late December/early January\n- Prepare royal parties: January\n- Travel: late January/February\n- Event: Late February or early March 1433?\n\nThis is winter travel though, which is challenging. Alternatively, wait for spring which would push it to April/May 1433.\n\nAlso need to consider:\n- João I is 73 and might not be able to travel easily\n- Alfonso V of Aragon is in Naples and has complicated relationship with Castile\n- The Infantes Juan and Enrique renounced claims to Aragon's throne, so there's tension there\n\n- Carlos of Navarre's young age presents significant diplomatic challenges\n\nI'll need to carefully navigate the political complexities of a child monarch's participation. Carlos will require a regent or senior advisors to represent Navarre, which adds another layer of diplomatic negotiation. The event's success depends on managing these delicate political relationships and ensuring appropriate representation for each kingdom.\n\nÁlvaro's expression shifts immediately to one of profound respect. \"Of course, Your Majesty. You're absolutely right. The papal bull is explicit—the crusade must be formally concluded with a Te Deum in the conquered territories before crusaders can be released from their vows.\"\n\nHe nods slowly, his mind clearly working through the implications.\n\n\"And inviting all the rulers of Iberia to witness the completion of the Reconquista together... Your Majesty, that's not just appropriate ceremony. That's statesmanship. The first time in centuries all the Christian kingdoms of Iberia would gather not to war against each other, but to celebrate a shared victory over the last Muslim realm. The symbolism is... extraordinary.\"\n\nDiego pulls out a clean sheet of parchment and begins calculating. \"Let me work through the timeline, Your Majesty.\"\n\nÁlvaro begins pacing, thinking aloud. \"The rulers to invite:\n\nKing João I of Portugal - Your father-by-marriage, Queen Isabel's father. He's approximately seventy-three years old now. The journey from Lisbon to Granada is substantial—perhaps 450 miles through winter terrain.\n\nKing Carlos of Navarre - Technically the king, but he's only eleven years old, son of Infante Juan de Aragón. He would come with regents and advisors, probably including his father as well. From Pamplona to Granada, perhaps 400 miles.\n\nKing Alfonso V of Aragon - This is... complicated, Your Majesty. He's currently in Naples managing his Italian territories. The journey from Naples to Granada would take two months at minimum, crossing the entire Mediterranean and then overland. Moreover...\" He hesitates.\n\n\"Moreover, the political situation is delicate. The Infantes Juan and Enrique—who just served in your crusade—renounced all claims to Aragon's throne. Alfonso is their nephew. Inviting him while his uncles are present could be awkward. He might interpret the invitation as rubbing salt in the wound, or he might be genuinely honored that you're putting that conflict behind you.\"\n\nDiego looks up from his calculations. \"For the timeline, Your Majesty, we must consider several stages:\n\nStage One: Sending Invitations (1 week)\n\nDraft formal invitations with appropriate ceremony\n\nMultiple copies with seals and credentials\n\nDispatch by fastest couriers\n\nStage Two: Delivery and Response (2-4 weeks depending on destination)\n\nPortugal: 5-7 days to Lisbon, similar return = 2 weeks total\n\nNavarre: 7-10 days to Pamplona, similar return = 3 weeks total\n\nAragon: If Alfonso is in Barcelona, 2 weeks. If in Naples, 6-8 weeks just for delivery\n\nStage Three: Preparation (2-3 weeks)\n\nRoyal households preparing for journey\n\nAssembling appropriate retinues and gifts\n\nArranging security and logistics\n\nStage Four: Travel to Granada (3-5 weeks depending on origin)\n\nPortugal: 3-4 weeks in winter conditions\n\nNavarre: 3-4 weeks\n\nAragon: 3-4 weeks from Barcelona, 8-10 weeks from Naples\n\nStage Five: Assembly and Ceremony (1 week)\n\nAll parties arriving and settling in Granada\n\nPreliminary meetings and protocol discussions\n\nThe grand Te Deum itself\n\nÁlvaro returns to the table. \"If we send invitations today—December 1st—here are the realistic scenarios:\n\nSCENARIO ONE: WINTER CEREMONY (Late February/Early March 1433)\n\nTimeline:\n\nInvitations sent: December 1-7, 1432\n\nResponses received: Late December/Early January\n\nPreparation: January\n\nTravel: Late January/February\n\nCeremony: Late February or Early March 1433\n\nAdvantages:\n\nRelatively quick—only 3 months from now\n\nMaintains momentum from Granada's conquest\n\nYou could still travel to Rome and Basel in spring\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nWinter travel is challenging, especially for elderly João I\n\nMountain passes might be dangerous\n\nAlfonso V almost certainly cannot come from Naples in time\n\nSome rulers might decline due to weather concerns\n\nRealistic Attendance:\n\nKing João I: 70% chance (old, but it's his daughter's husband's triumph)\n\nKing Carlos of Navarre: 90% chance (close, Infante Juan would want to attend)\n\nKing Alfonso V: 10% chance (too far, too complicated, winter travel from Naples impossible)\n\nSCENARIO TWO: SPRING CEREMONY (Late April/Early May 1433)\n\nTimeline:\n\nInvitations sent: December 1-7, 1432\n\nResponses received: January\n\nPreparation: February-March\n\nTravel: April (better weather)\n\nCeremony: Late April or Early May 1433\n\nAdvantages:\n\nMuch better weather for travel\n\nSafer mountain passes\n\nMore dignified and comfortable for elderly rulers\n\nAlfonso V might be able to come from Naples\n\nBetter conditions for grand ceremony\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n5 months from now—momentum from conquest slightly diminished\n\nDelays your Rome and Basel journey until summer\n\nBasel's critical negotiations might conclude without you\n\nRealistic Attendance:\n\nKing João I: 90% chance (better weather, less dangerous)\n\nKing Carlos of Navarre: 95% chance\n\nKing Alfonso V: 40% chance (possible but still challenging from Naples, political complications remain)\n\nÁlvaro looks at you seriously. \"Your Majesty, my counsel would be late April or early May. Here's why:\n\nOne: King João is seventy-three. Winter travel through mountainous terrain could kill him. If he dies en route to honor your victory, that would be... catastrophic politically and personally. Spring travel is far safer.\n\nTwo: A Te Deum celebrating 710 years of Reconquista deserves perfect conditions. Late April in Granada—the gardens blooming, the weather mild, the Alhambra at its most beautiful. Make it a ceremony worthy of the achievement.\n\nThree: You gain a small but real chance of Alfonso V attending from Naples. Four months' notice with spring sailing conditions makes it possible, if unlikely. Even if he declines, you gave him the opportunity—that matters diplomatically.\n\nFour: You can use the intervening months productively. Address the Sierra Nevada fortresses that haven't submitted. Ensure Granada's governance is stable. Prepare the city for hosting all Iberia's rulers. Make sure the ceremony itself is flawless.\n\nFive: Even if Basel's negotiations conclude before you arrive, your delegation is already there and performing well. You'll arrive for whatever comes after—implementation, reconciliation with Rome, or addressing new crises.\"\n\nDiego adds: \"The delay also gives us time to prepare Granada properly, Your Majesty. Converting the Grand Mosque to a cathedral for the Te Deum—the Archbishop said Christmas Day for reconsecration. That's barely three weeks away. Better to give him until April, ensure the space is truly ready for this historic moment.\"\n\nÁlvaro spreads his hands. \"So my recommendation: Send invitations this week for a ceremony in late April. That gives approximately 20-22 weeks from now. Travel to Granada in mid-April to finalize preparations. Host the Te Deum with all Iberian rulers in late April. Then proceed to Rome in May, and Basel in June or July.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"Does this seem wise, Your Majesty? Or do you prefer the earlier winter ceremony despite the risks?\""

Very well done.\"\n\nHe pulls fresh parchment toward him and begins making notes.\n\n\"Let me confirm I understand the full scope of work before April:\n\nONE: INVITATIONS (This week)\n\nI'll draft formal invitations to:\n\nKing João I of Portugal\n\nKing Carlos of Navarre (and his father Infante Juan as regent)\n\nQueen María of Aragon and King Alfonso V (with the diplomatic language you specified)\n\nThe invitations will specify late April for the Te Deum at Granada's newly consecrated cathedral, celebrating the completion of the Reconquista. I'll have them ready for your seal by tomorrow, dispatched by fastest couriers immediately after.\"\n\nTWO: SIERRA NEVADA COMMANDERS (February/March)\n\n\"Don García López de Padilla is currently temporary governor in Granada. I'll send him explicit instructions to issue formal summons to all fortress commanders in the Sierra Nevada—the three who haven't responded yet, plus any others we want to assess. The summons will be under banner of truce, inviting them to Granada to swear fealty and receive confirmation of their positions.\"\n\nHe taps his quill thoughtfully. \"We should set the assembly for... early March? That gives them time to receive the summons and travel down from the mountains, but leaves us six weeks before the Te Deum to handle any defiance. If they refuse to come or arrive and prove hostile, we have time to bring military force to bear before the ceremony.\"\n\n\"I'll instruct Don García to be gracious but firm. Frame it exactly as you suggested before—they haven't been officially summoned yet, so no offense taken for delay. But now they are summoned, and their response will determine how we proceed.\"\n\nTHREE: ARTILLERY MOVEMENT (As soon as weather permits - late January/February)\n\n\"Master Gunner Pietro Calabrese is with the main army. I'll send orders for him to prepare all five bombards for transport to Granada. In winter conditions, that's a slow process—those pieces are enormous. But if we begin preparations in January and move them in February when passes are clearer, they should be positioned around Granada by early March.\"\n\n\"Positioning them around Granada serves dual purpose: ready if the Sierra Nevada commanders prove defiant and need reduction, but also impressive display for the visiting monarchs. Let them see the artillery that broke fortress after fortress.\"\n\nFOUR: CRUSADER CONCENTRATION (February-March)\n\n\"Approximately 798 sworn crusaders currently distributed across garrisons and winter quarters. I'll issue orders for them to concentrate in Granada by mid-March. That gives them time to travel and settle, and ensures they're present for both the Sierra Nevada resolution and the Te Deum.\"\n\n\"These men took their oaths before the sacred relics and the white banner. They should witness the crusade's formal conclusion and participate in the victory ceremony. After the Te Deum, they'll accompany you to Rome to return the relics—a fitting culmination of their service.\"\n\nFIVE: LAND GRANTS PREPARATION (December-April)\n\nDiego leans forward. \"This is the most complex task, Your Majesty. We're speaking of approximately 750-800 land grants that need to be surveyed, documented, and prepared. Let me break this down:\n\nFor Common Crusaders (~700 men):\n\n50-100 acres of farmland each\n\nMixture of lands in conquered Granada territories\n\nNeed to survey, mark boundaries, assess quality\n\nPrepare title documents\n\nTotal: perhaps 50,000-70,000 acres to distribute\n\nFor Noble Crusaders (~50-100 men who were already minor nobility or earned such recognition):\n\nLarger estates, perhaps 500-2,000 acres depending on service\n\nMay include villages, mills, income-producing properties\n\nMore complex documentation\n\nNeed to consider strategic locations\n\nProcess:\n\nHire surveying teams (we can use men from the crusade tax assessment program—they have the skills)\n\nPrioritize lands closest to established settlements for common soldiers\n\nGranada's Vega and surrounding territories have excellent farmland\n\nSome mountain properties for those who prefer them\n\nBegin immediately, work through winter, complete by late March\n\nComplications:\n\nSome lands currently occupied by Muslim families—need to handle this carefully\n\nSome properties need infrastructure (irrigation, buildings)\n\nMust ensure lands are actually productive, not just empty desert\n\nTitle documentation must be bulletproof to prevent future disputes\"\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"I'll coordinate this with Don García in Granada. He can oversee the surveying work while managing the fortress commander summons. We'll need perhaps thirty good surveyors working through February and March.\"\n\nHe looks up at you. \"Cost estimate for all of this, Your Majesty: approximately 15,000-20,000 maravedís for surveying, documentation, and administrative work. That's... 60-75 florins, quite manageable from the crown treasury.\"\n\nSIX: GRANADA PREPARATION FOR TE DEUM (December-April)\n\n\"The Archbishop needs to complete the Grand Mosque's conversion to cathedral—he says Christmas Day for reconsecration, but we should give him until March to ensure it's truly magnificent for this ceremony. The Te Deum celebrating 710 years of Reconquista deserves perfect execution.\"\n\n\"We'll also need to prepare accommodations for visiting monarchs and their retinues. King João will bring perhaps 100-200 attendants. Each court will need appropriate quarters, security, hospitality. Don García will need resources and guidance for this.\"\n\nÁlvaro sets down his quill and looks at you directly.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I can absolutely coordinate all of this. The timeline is ambitious but achievable. Here's how I propose we divide the labor:\n\nI will personally handle:\n\nDrafting and dispatching invitations\n\nCoordinating with Don García on fortress commander summons and ceremony preparations\n\nManaging overall timeline and ensuring all pieces come together\n\nDiego de Daza will handle:\n\nLand grant surveying and documentation\n\nFinancial tracking and resource allocation\n\nTitle preparation and administrative paperwork\n\nDon García López de Padilla in Granada will handle:\n\nReceiving and assessing fortress commanders\n\nCoordinating with Archbishop on cathedral preparation\n\nPreparing accommodations and hospitality for visiting monarchs\n\nLocal security and logistics\n\nMaster Gunner Pietro Calabrese will handle:\n\nArtillery movement and positioning\n\nTactical preparations if fortress reduction becomes necessary\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso de Robles will handle:\n\nCrusader concentration and organization\n\nSecurity arrangements for ceremony\n\nCoordination of military displays for visiting monarchs\"\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"Unless you see gaps or concerns, Your Majesty, I'll begin issuing these orders today. The invitations will be ready for your seal tomorrow morning. The other instructions will go out by week's end.\"\n\n\"Is there anything you wish to add or modify before we proceed?\""

Perhaps sixty men—a mix of students in various military dress and instructors—stand at attention, watching.\n\nSir Thomas recovers quickly. \"But you honor us with this visit. Would Your Majesty like to review the progress we've made? We've accomplished... well, quite a bit since you departed in March, though I confess the work feels only beginning.\"\n\nHe gestures toward the main building. \"The commandant is conducting an advanced tactics seminar with the senior students—Italian and Hungarian methods of cavalry engagement. Or if Your Majesty prefers, I can assemble the faculty to provide a comprehensive report.\"\n\nThe courtyard waits in respectful silence. Sir Thomas clearly wants to show off what they've built, but is uncertain what you most wish to see first."

          "text": "The roll of 43 falls in the \"41-55: SOLID FOUNDATION - Meeting Expectations\" range. This matches what happened in Chapter 33 where the roll was 46, so we're very close to that outcome.\n\nBased on this result, the academy should have:\n- Initial friction between faculty that was overcome\n- Hunyadi emerging as respected leader\n- Practical, useful synthesis (not revolutionary but genuinely useful)\n- Combined Hungarian mobility, German shock, Italian engineering, Spanish frontier experience\n- 15 well-trained junior officers ready for command\n- Comprehensive tactical manual produced\n- Students grasp combined-arms principles\n- Ongoing curriculum established\n- Foundation for permanent officer corps\n- Proves concept works, needs refinement\n\nThis is a \"modest success\" - the academy worked, it's producing results, but it's not transformative yet. It's the beginning of something good that can be built upon.\n\nSir Thomas should report honestly - they accomplished what they set out to do, had some challenges, but have established a solid foundation. The students are trained, the doctrine is useful, the program is sustainable.\n\nSir Thomas leads you across the courtyard toward the main building. As you walk, training continues around you—students practicing mounted maneuvers in one corner, a lecture on siege engineering happening under an awning, the rhythmic clang of practice swords from another group.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I'll be honest,\" Sir Thomas begins. \"The first month was... difficult. We had some of the finest military minds in Christendom gathered under one roof, and they each arrived convinced their nation's methods were superior. The Hungarians believed cavalry mobility was everything. The French insisted disciplined infantry was paramount. The Italians argued for combined-arms sophistication. The Germans wanted shock tactics.\"\n\nHe opens the door to what was once the monastery's chapter house, now converted to a planning room. Maps cover the walls—Granada, the Balkans, hypothetical battle scenarios. A large table dominates the center, scattered with documents and miniature soldiers representing different troop types.\n\n\"János Hunyadi saved us,\" Sir Thomas continues. \"About six weeks in, he stood up during a particularly heated argument between Sforza and the German knights and said something I'll never forget: 'Gentlemen, the Ottomans don't care about our pride. They care that we keep losing. If we can't set aside our egos long enough to learn from each other, we deserve to be conquered.'\"\n\nHe gestures to a thick leather-bound volume on the table—perhaps 200 pages of carefully written text and diagrams.\n\n\"That was the turning point. After that, the experts started genuinely listening to each other rather than just waiting for their turn to speak. Hunyadi emerged as the natural coordinator—not because he claimed authority, but because the others respected him. He's fought the Ottomans. He's lost to them, learned from them, beaten them. That's worth more than any theory.\"\n\nSir Thomas picks up the volume. \"This is what we've produced—nine months of work. It's not revolutionary, Your Majesty. I won't claim we've discovered some magical formation that will make Christian armies invincible. But it's useful. Genuinely useful.\"\n\nHe opens to a section with detailed diagrams. \"We've synthesized Hungarian cavalry tactics—their speed and mobility—with German shock power, Italian engineering and logistics expertise, French infantry discipline, and Spanish frontier experience. The result is practical doctrine for fighting Muslim armies, particularly the Ottomans.\"\n\n\"For example,\" he points to a diagram showing troop positions, \"this is a formation for engaging Ottoman cavalry archers. It combines Hungarian lessons about maintaining mobility to avoid being pinned, German heavy cavalry for decisive charges at the right moment, and Italian crossbowmen positioned to disrupt their shooting. It's not any one nation's method—it's a synthesis.\"\n\nHe turns to another section. \"Here's siege doctrine combining Burgundian artillery expertise with Italian engineering and Spanish experience from Granada. And this section covers logistics—how to supply an army in hostile territory using techniques that worked against both Granada and the Ottomans in the Balkans.\"\n\nSir Thomas sets down the volume and looks at you directly. \"The students—your fifteen young officers—they've absorbed this. They understand combined-arms warfare not as abstract theory but as practical reality. They can coordinate cavalry, infantry, and artillery. They understand why logistics matters as much as courage. They know how to gather intelligence and use it.\"\n\nHe walks to the window overlooking the courtyard where the students are training. \"That young man there, the Mendoza cousin—he's twenty-one. Six months ago he thought warfare was about individual valor and noble charges. Yesterday he presented a tactical analysis of how to counter Ottoman sipahi cavalry using coordinated pike squares and crossbow volleys that impressed Hunyadi himself.\"\n\n\"Marco Tornesi—you remember him from Barcelona, the Italian mercenary seeking redemption?—he's become our artillery specialist. He's working with the Burgundians on improving siege train logistics.\"\n\nSir Thomas turns back to you. \"Your Majesty, I won't pretend this is everything you hoped for. We had conflicts. The language barriers slowed us down—we lost weeks to simple misunderstandings. Some of the tactical innovations we attempted didn't work in practice. We're still refining the curriculum.\"\n\n\"But the foundation is solid. The experts are now genuinely collaborating rather than competing. The students are being trained to a standard no other Christian kingdom can match. And most importantly, we've proven the concept works—that you can bring together diverse military traditions and create something better than any of them individually.\"\n\nHe picks up another, thinner document. \"This is our proposal for year two. We want to expand to thirty students. We've identified areas where our doctrine needs more development—particularly naval warfare and fortress design. And we'd like to start hosting foreign observers—let other kingdoms see what we're doing, maybe even send their own students.\"\n\n\"The academy isn't transforming Castilian military power overnight, Your Majesty. But it's building the foundation for that transformation. Give us three to five years of sustained work, and we'll have trained a corps of officers who understand modern warfare better than anyone in Christendom except perhaps the Ottomans themselves.\"\n\nSir Thomas steps back, standing at attention. \"That's my honest assessment, Your Majesty. We've met expectations—not exceeded them spectacularly, but met them solidly. The investment was worthwhile. The program is sustainable. And if you continue supporting it, it will pay dividends for decades.\"\n\nHe gestures toward the courtyard. \"Would Your Majesty like to observe some training? Or speak with the students? Hunyadi is currently conducting an advanced seminar on cavalry tactics—he'd be honored if you attended.\""

          "text": "János Hunyadi is a real historical figure - one of the greatest Christian commanders who fought the Ottomans in the 15th century. He was Hungarian, fought numerous battles against the Ottomans, and was known for his tactical brilliance. In real history, he lived 1406-1456, so in 1432 he would be about 26 years old - relatively young but already with significant combat experience.\n\nI should show:\n1. Hunyadi teaching/lecturing\n2. His expertise and command of the subject\n3. The students engaged and learning\n4. Natural transition to meeting Juan\n5. Respectful but not obsequious - Hunyadi is a proud warrior and expert\n\nLet me create a scene that shows the academy functioning and Hunyadi's leadership/teaching style.\n\nSir Thomas brightens. \"He's in the main hall—what was the monastery's refectory. Follow me, Your Majesty.\"\n\nHe leads you through a corridor lined with weapon racks and training equipment, then pushes open a heavy wooden door.\n\nThe hall is spacious, with high vaulted ceilings and narrow windows letting in shafts of afternoon light. The religious frescoes have been whitewashed over, replaced with tactical diagrams and maps. Perhaps forty men fill the space—the fifteen students seated on benches at the front, with the foreign experts and Castilian officers standing or sitting along the sides, observing.\n\nAt the front, a man in his mid-twenties commands the room.\n\nJános Hunyadi is not what you expected. He's younger than most of the other experts—perhaps twenty-six or twenty-seven—with dark hair, sharp features, and eyes that seem to miss nothing. He wears plain brown leather and wool, no ornamentation, no badge of rank. When he speaks, his voice carries easily through the hall, accented but clear Castilian.\n\nHe's using a large sand table—perhaps eight feet by six feet—with small carved wooden pieces representing different troop types. The terrain shows hills, a river, open ground.\n\n\"—and this is the mistake Christian commanders make again and again,\" Hunyadi is saying, moving a cluster of heavy cavalry pieces forward. \"They see Ottoman cavalry archers and think: 'We have heavier armor, better horses. We charge, we break them.'\"\n\nHe moves the cavalry pieces directly toward the Ottoman forces. Then sweeps the Ottoman pieces away to either side.\n\n\"What happens? The Ottomans scatter. They're light cavalry—that's the entire point. They're not there to stand and fight your charge. They're there to draw you forward.\"\n\nHe moves the Christian cavalry pieces deep into the center of the table, then brings the Ottoman pieces circling back around the flanks.\n\n\"Now you're extended. Your horses are tired from the charge. Your formation is disrupted. And suddenly they're hitting you from three sides with arrows while staying just out of reach of your lances.\"\n\nHe moves Ottoman archer pieces around the Christian cavalry, then starts removing Christian pieces one by one.\n\n\"Your men are dying. Your horses are panicking. And the Ottoman heavy cavalry—the sipahi—who you never even saw?\" He places heavy cavalry pieces at the edge of the table. \"They've been waiting for exactly this moment. They hit your exhausted, disrupted, arrow-riddled force with fresh troops in good formation.\"\n\nHe removes most of the remaining Christian pieces.\n\n\"This is how they destroyed the Serbian army at Kosovo. How they broke the Crusade of Nicopolis. How they've won battle after battle against opponents who thought courage and heavy armor would be enough.\"\n\nOne of the students—the young Mendoza cousin Sir Thomas mentioned—raises his hand tentatively. \"So... we don't charge?\"\n\nHunyadi smiles slightly. \"I didn't say that. I said this charge—the undisciplined pursuit of light cavalry into broken ground—is suicide. But there are ways to use heavy cavalry effectively against Ottomans.\"\n\nHe resets the sand table, this time positioning the pieces differently.\n\n\"You anchor your heavy cavalry with infantry—pikes, crossbows, even some light cavalry of your own. When the Ottoman horse archers come forward to harass you, your infantry holds position. Your crossbows shoot back, make them keep their distance. Your light cavalry screens the flanks.\"\n\nHe demonstrates, keeping the Christian formation tight.\n\n\"The Ottomans probe, shoot, try to draw you forward. But you don't move. You make them come to you, or you advance slowly, maintaining formation. You control the tempo of the battle instead of letting them control it.\"\n\n\"Eventually they have to commit—either their heavy cavalry attacks, or they withdraw. If they withdraw, you've won without fighting. If they attack?\" He moves the Ottoman heavy cavalry forward. \"Now it's heavy against heavy, and your infantry is there to support. You're fighting on your terms, not theirs.\"\n\nOne of the German knights speaks up from the side of the room. \"But this requires discipline. Waiting under arrow fire while men die. Most cavalry won't hold.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Hunyadi says. \"This is why the Ottomans win. Not because they're braver—Christian knights are brave. Not because they're better armed—we have better armor. They win because they have discipline, organization, and commanders who understand that warfare is not about individual glory but about winning.\"\n\nIt's at this moment that he notices the commotion at the door—your entrance with Sir Thomas. His eyes widen slightly, and he immediately sets down the wooden pieces and bows.\n\n\"Your Majesty! We did not expect—\" He glances at the assembled students and experts, all of whom have risen and are bowing.\n\nThe room has fallen completely silent."

          "text": "1. The historical context: This is a 15th-century roleplay where religious conflict between Christianity and Islam was a real historical phenomenon. The Crusades, the Reconquista, and Ottoman expansion were historical realities.\n\n2. The character: Juan II in this alternate history has just completed the Reconquista and is thinking about broader Christian-Muslim conflict in the context of his era. This is historically authentic for a 15th-century Christian monarch.\n\n3. The concern: The user's phrasing \"eliminate them as a religion threatening Christianity\" could be interpreted as advocating for religious persecution or genocide. However, in context, this appears to be asking about the historical/strategic question within the roleplay.\n\n4. How to handle: I should respond as the NPC Hunyadi would - honestly and from a 15th-century military/strategic perspective, but I should focus on the practical/military/political dimensions rather than endorsing religious elimination or persecution. Hunyadi would likely give a pragmatic assessment of what would be required to reverse Ottoman expansion in Europe and potentially reclaim the Holy Land - which would involve military, economic, political, and demographic factors.\n\nI can discuss historical military strategy without advocating for religious persecution or elimination. I'll have Hunyadi focus on:\n- Military/strategic requirements\n- Political unity needed\n- Economic resources\n- Demographic challenges\n- The practical impossibility of \"eliminating\" a religion\n- Focus on defensive goals (driving them from Europe) vs. offensive impossibilities\n\nThis keeps it historically authentic while not endorsing religious persecution or genocide.\n\nThe students and experts file out quietly, glancing back with curiosity but respecting your command. Sir Thomas closes the door behind them, leaving you alone with János Hunyadi in the large hall.\n\nThe young Hungarian straightens from his bow, meeting your eyes. For a moment he's silent, clearly weighing his response. When he speaks, his voice is measured, serious.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the question every Christian ruler should be asking. But most are afraid of the answer.\"\n\nHe walks to the sand table, staring down at the wooden pieces representing armies.\n\n\"Tactics can win battles. But tactics alone cannot win this war. Let me be blunt about what would truly be required.\"\n\nHe begins counting on his fingers.\n\n\"First: Unity. This is the greatest obstacle. Right now, Christendom is divided. The Pope fights with the Council of Basel. France and England recently finished tearing each other apart. The Holy Roman Empire is a collection of squabbling princes. Italian city-states war with each other. Poland and Hungary compete instead of cooperating. And your Iberian kingdoms—until very recently—fought each other as much as they fought Granada.\"\n\n\"The Ottomans face no such division. The Sultan commands absolutely. When he calls for war, the entire empire mobilizes. We argue in councils while they act with single purpose.\"\n\n\"Second: Resources and population. Your Majesty, the Ottoman Empire is vast. From Anatolia to the Balkans, from the Black Sea to the Aegean. Perhaps twelve to fifteen million subjects. They can raise armies of 60,000, 80,000, even 100,000 men. How many troops did you have for the Granada campaign? 35,000? And that exhausted your kingdom's resources.\"\n\n\"To drive the Ottomans from Europe would require sustained campaigns for decades with armies of 100,000 or more. To take Constantinople back—which is now their capital, magnificently fortified—would require resources beyond what any single Christian kingdom possesses. And Jerusalem?\" He shakes his head. \"That's in Mamluk Egypt now, another powerful Muslim state. You'd have to conquer through thousands of miles of hostile territory.\"\n\n\"Third: Permanent military organization. Your Majesty, you have what—798 sworn crusaders? Professional soldiers committed for the duration. That's excellent. The Ottomans have tens of thousands of janissaries—professional infantry trained from childhood. They have the sipahi cavalry system—provincial cavalry maintained permanently through land grants. They have a standing military that doesn't disband when the campaign ends.\"\n\n\"To match them, every Christian kingdom would need permanent professional armies, not feudal levies that serve forty days and go home. That requires money. Enormous, sustained taxation that most nobles would resist.\"\n\nHe turns to face you directly.\n\n\"Fourth: Naval power. The Ottomans control the eastern Mediterranean. Any crusade to the Holy Land requires crossing either by sea or through thousands of miles of land. Venice and Genoa have strong navies, but they're more interested in trade than holy war. Building a Christian fleet capable of transporting and supplying 100,000 men across the Mediterranean and keeping them supplied for years? Astronomical cost.\"\n\n\"Fifth: Time and will. Your Majesty conquered Granada in less than three years. Extraordinary. But the Ottomans have been expanding for over a century. Reversing that would take—if everything went perfectly—fifty years minimum. More realistically? A hundred years of sustained effort. Can Christendom maintain that focus for a century? When there are always more immediate concerns, more local conflicts, more reasons to turn inward?\"\n\nHe pauses, then continues more quietly.\n\n\"As for eliminating Islam as a religion... Your Majesty, I have fought them for ten years. I have killed hundreds of Turkish soldiers. I have burned their villages and taken their fortresses. And I tell you honestly: you cannot eliminate a faith from human hearts through conquest.\"\n\n\"In Granada, you can force conversions because the Muslim population is small and isolated—perhaps 300,000 people surrounded by millions of Christians. But Islam from Persia to Morocco, from Egypt to Anatolia? Perhaps sixty or seventy million Muslims? Even if you conquered every square mile—which would take centuries—you cannot force that many people to abandon their faith. They would resist, rebel, practice in secret. It would require perpetual occupation, perpetual violence, perpetual suppression. No empire in history has sustained such an effort.\"\n\nHe looks at you seriously.\n\n\"I do not say these things to discourage Your Majesty. You asked for honesty, and I give it. What can be achieved? We can stop Ottoman expansion. We can defend Hungary, defend the Balkans, hold Constantinople if we get there in time. We can make further conquest too costly for them, create a stable frontier. We can even, with enormous effort and extraordinary luck, push them back from Europe—though that alone would require decades.\"\n\n\"But drive them from Jerusalem? Eliminate Islam? Your Majesty, Alexander the Great couldn't conquer the entire world, and neither can we. We can defend Christendom. We can create strong frontiers. We can make them respect our power and leave our lands alone. That is victory enough—if we can achieve even that.\"\n\nHe gestures toward the maps on the wall.\n\n\"My recommendation? Focus first on defense. Save Constantinople—that alone would be a historic achievement. Stabilize Hungary and the Balkans. Build permanent military institutions like this academy across Christendom. Create alliances, coordinate strategy, maintain professional forces. Build strength gradually over generations.\"\n\n\"Then, perhaps—in fifty years, in a hundred years—if Christendom remains united and strong while the Ottomans weaken or divide, maybe we could reclaim the Holy Land. But it would be our grandchildren's grandchildren who prayed at the Holy Sepulcher, not us.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"Is this the answer Your Majesty wanted? Probably not. But it is the truth as I see it from ten years of bleeding against them. Tactics win battles. But this war will be won or lost on questions of unity, resources, institutions, and time.\""

          "text": "Hunyadi would be struck by this response. He's used to rulers who either:\n1. Ignore reality and charge ahead foolishly, or\n2. Hear the difficulties and give up\n\nJuan is doing neither. He's accepting the reality but refusing to see it as impossible - just as work to be done.\n\nThis would deeply impress Hunyadi. This is the kind of leader he's been hoping to find. Someone who combines vision with realism, faith with practicality.\n\nI need to show Hunyadi's reaction - the realization that he's found something rare. A king who actually understands what's required and is committed to doing it.\n\nThis should be a turning point moment in their relationship.\n\nHunyadi stares at you for a long moment, his expression shifting from cautious reserve to something else—surprise, then slowly, something like wonder.\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" He stops, seeming to search for words. \"In ten years of war, I have met many Christian lords. Most hear what I just told you and react in one of two ways.\"\n\nHe holds up one finger. \"Either they dismiss it. 'You're too pessimistic, Hungarian. God will provide. We just need faith and courage.' They charge off to glorious defeats, and I bury their men afterward.\"\n\nA second finger. \"Or they despair. 'It's impossible, so why try? Let's just defend our borders and hope for the best.' They retreat, and the Ottomans advance another fifty miles.\"\n\nHe lowers his hand, looking at you with new intensity.\n\n\"You are the first Christian ruler I've met who hears 'this is what's required' and responds: 'Good. Then let's do that.'\"\n\nHe steps closer, his voice gaining energy.\n\n\"You just conquered Granada—something your ancestors tried for 700 years. You're twenty years old. And you stand here telling me to leave the impossible to you and focus on the work?\"\n\nA smile breaks across his face—genuine, almost fierce.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am Hungarian. My country has bled for a century holding the line against Islam while the rest of Christendom argued and dithered. I have watched Christian armies be destroyed because their commanders valued pride over wisdom. I have begged kings and emperors for help and been promised everything, given nothing.\"\n\nHe gestures emphatically. \"And then I hear about this young Castilian king who actually won his crusade, who builds military academies instead of just talking about reform, who asks 'what must be done?' instead of 'why is this so hard?'\"\n\nHis voice drops, becoming deadly serious.\n\n\"Do I tire of doing the Lord's work? No, Your Majesty. I will fight Ottomans until the day I die. The question has always been whether I would die in vain, holding back the tide alone, or whether someone—anyone—in Christendom would finally understand what must be done and commit to doing it.\"\n\nHe places his hand over his heart.\n\n\"You want to know what's required? Let me be more specific. Not defeatist—practical.\"\n\nHe moves back to the sand table, his energy transformed from cautious instructor to passionate strategist.\n\n\"Unity first. You cannot command France or the Holy Roman Empire, but you can build alliances. Hungary and Castile—that's a start. Add Poland. Add Venice if we can overcome their merchant's calculating hearts. Create a league—not a loose agreement but a real coalition with coordinated strategy, shared resources, combined command. Model it on what you've done with the Military Orders here—independent powers unified under supreme crusade authority.\"\n\n\"Professional armies. You have 798 crusaders. Excellent foundation. Hungary has perhaps 5,000 professional cavalry in the banderia system. We need fifty thousand professional troops across Christendom—infantry, cavalry, artillery—maintained year-round, trained to common doctrine. This academy is the first step. We need ten more like it. Twenty. Train officers who share common language of warfare, common tactics, common understanding.\"\n\n\"Naval power. You've taken Granada's coast. You have ports—Málaga, Almería. Build a fleet. Not just transport ships but war galleys, fighting ships that can challenge Ottoman naval power. It will cost a fortune. Do it anyway. Pay Genoese and Venetian shipwrights whatever they demand. In twenty years, Castile could have the strongest Christian navy in the Mediterranean.\"\n\n\"Taxation and finance. This is the hardest part. Everything I just described requires money—staggering amounts, sustained for decades. You've created the crusade taxation system for Granada. Don't let it end. Extend it. Make it permanent. 'Perpetual crusade' isn't just a phrase—make it reality. Christendom must accept that defending the faith requires continuous financial commitment, not just occasional donations.\"\n\n\"Time and succession. Your Majesty, you are twenty. You could rule for forty more years if God wills. But even forty years isn't enough. This must outlive you. Train your successor—your son, your daughter, whoever inherits—to continue this work. Make it Castile's mission. The kingdom that finished the Reconquista becomes the kingdom that defends all Christendom. That's a legacy worth building.\"\n\nHe straightens, meeting your eyes with fierce conviction.\n\n\"Constantinople is the immediate crisis. The city could fall within five years, maybe ten. If you can reach them with a strong force—15,000 professional troops, modern artillery, supplied by your new fleet—you could save it. That alone would be historic. It would prove Christian power can match the Ottomans. It would give hope to every Christian in the East.\"\n\n\"From that foundation—from saved Constantinople, from trained armies, from permanent institutions—you could build toward Jerusalem. Not next year, not in ten years. But in thirty years? In fifty? With sustained effort and God's grace?\"\n\nHis smile returns, edged with something dangerous.\n\n\"Your Majesty, you just did what was 'impossible' in Granada. You were eighteen years old, you had a rebellion in progress, you had limited resources, and everyone said it would take decades. You did it in three years.\"\n\n\"I don't tell you the requirements to discourage you. I tell you because you're the first Christian ruler I've met who might actually do them. Who sees 'this requires fifty years of sustained work' and thinks 'good, let's start today.'\"\n\nHe bows, deeper than before.\n\n\"Do I tire of the Lord's work? No, Your Majesty. And if you're truly committed to this—not just words but action, not just one campaign but a lifetime—then Hungary will stand with you. My sword, my knowledge, everything I have learned bleeding against the Turks. I will teach your officers. I will train your armies. I will help you build what must be built.\"\n\n\"Because finally, finally, I've found a Christian king who doesn't just talk about crusading—you actually crusade. And if anyone in this generation can do what seems impossible...\"\n\nHe looks at you steadily.\n\n\"It will be you.\""

          "text": "Hunyadi is a realistic military commander who has fought the Ottomans for 10 years. He would evaluate this proposal honestly. Let me think about what he would say:\n\nPOSITIVE FACTORS:\n- 35,000-40,000 well-trained, disciplined troops COULD potentially defeat larger Ottoman forces through superior tactics, discipline, and coordination\n- Historical examples exist of smaller professional armies defeating larger forces\n- If supplied through Hungary, it would have a secure supply line\n- Hunyadi knows that discipline and organization can overcome numerical superiority\n\nCONCERNS:\n- 35,000-40,000 is still a massive army by 15th century standards - very difficult to supply and maintain\n- The Ottomans at 100,000 would have significant numerical advantage - roughly 3:1 or 2.5:1\n- Supply lines through Hungary are long and vulnerable\n- Campaign duration matters - can such an army be sustained for multiple campaign seasons?\n- The Ottomans have home territory advantage in the Balkans\n- Fortresses throughout the region would need to be reduced\n- Where would these 35,000-40,000 troops come from? Multiple kingdoms would need to contribute\n\nHunyadi would likely give a nuanced response: Yes, it's POSSIBLE, but here are the specific challenges and requirements. He'd be cautiously optimistic rather than either dismissive or blindly enthusiastic.\n\nThis is a good moment for realistic military assessment while still respecting Juan's ambition and vision.\n\nHunyadi's eyes light up. He moves immediately back to the sand table, sweeping away the smaller tactical setup and beginning to sketch with his finger in the sand—broader strokes, strategic scale.\n\n\"35,000 to 40,000 well-trained, well-supplied troops?\" He looks up at you, and there's genuine excitement now mixed with his professional caution. \"Your Majesty, yes. Absolutely yes. Not only can we stand up to 100,000 Ottomans—we could potentially defeat them.\"\n\nHe draws quickly in the sand, marking positions.\n\n\"The Ottomans' greatest strength is also a weakness. Those 100,000 troops? Perhaps 15,000 are janissaries and sipahi—truly professional soldiers. Another 30,000 are provincial cavalry and regular troops—competent but not elite. The remaining 55,000 are levies, conscripts, irregulars. They provide mass and intimidation, but their actual fighting quality is variable.\"\n\nHe marks different sections with different symbols.\n\n\"If you field 35,000 troops where every single man is trained to the standard of this academy—disciplined infantry, coordinated cavalry, professional artillery crews, experienced commanders who understand combined-arms warfare—you're not facing 100,000 soldiers. You're facing 15,000 professionals backed by 85,000 that will break under sustained pressure.\"\n\n\"I've seen it. At battles where we held discipline and terrain, Ottoman numbers didn't save them. The key is never letting them pin you in unfavorable circumstances, never letting them dictate the engagement, and having the logistical capacity to sustain operations until their larger but more fragile force begins fracturing.\"\n\nHe traces a line through the sand, marking what appears to be a supply route.\n\n\"Supplied through Hungary—excellent strategic thinking, Your Majesty. Hungary is the natural forward base. We have fortresses along the Danube, we know the terrain, we have experience operating there. A 35,000-man army could base in Hungary, advance into Serbia and Bulgaria, reduce Ottoman fortresses systematically, and force them to either engage us on ground we choose or cede territory.\"\n\nBut then his expression becomes more serious, and he holds up a cautionary hand.\n\n\"However, Your Majesty, I must be honest about the challenges. Not to discourage—to ensure we plan properly.\"\n\nHe begins counting again, this time with more urgency.\n\n\"First challenge: Assembly and maintenance. 35,000 professional troops is an enormous force. Granada was roughly that size, but most were noble levies serving short terms. A sustained professional army of that size would require...\"\n\nHe calculates quickly. \"At 60 maravedís per month per soldier—that's roughly 80 florins per year per man. For 35,000 men, approximately 2.8 million florins annually just in wages. Then provisions, equipment, replacements, artillery, sieges... you're looking at 4 to 5 million florins per year to maintain such a force in the field.\"\n\n\"Where does this money come from? Castile alone? Impossible—even with your new revenues. This would require Hungary contributing perhaps 500,000 to 700,000 florins annually, Poland another 300,000, Venice maybe 200,000 if we can convince them. And Castile bearing the lion's share—perhaps 2.5 to 3 million florins. Can you sustain that for five years? Ten years? Because driving the Ottomans from the Balkans won't happen in one campaign season.\"\n\n\"Second challenge: Command unity. If troops come from multiple kingdoms—say, 15,000 from Castile, 10,000 from Hungary, 7,000 from Poland, 5,000 from Venice, 3,000 from other sources—you need absolute unified command. Not a council of princes arguing. One supreme commander with authority over the entire force. Can you get Hungarian nobles to obey Castilian officers? Can you get Polish cavalry to follow Hungarian tactics? This academy helps—common training, common doctrine—but it requires political will from every contributing kingdom.\"\n\n\"Third challenge: Supply lines. Hungary to the Balkans is several hundred miles. Every day, 35,000 men consume enormous quantities—food, water, fodder for horses, ammunition for artillery, replacement equipment. You need a supply train of thousands of wagons, secure roads, forward depots, river transport on the Danube. The Ottomans will try to cut your supplies—they're excellent at raiding. You need forces dedicated purely to protecting your logistics, which means your actual fighting strength is less than 35,000.\"\n\n\"Fourth challenge: Campaign duration and weather. The Balkans aren't Granada—winters are harsh, especially in the mountains. You can campaign perhaps April to October, maybe into November if you're lucky. That's six to seven months. Then what? Do you garrison the conquests with part of your force and send the rest home? Do you maintain winter quarters in hostile territory? Every fortress you take requires garrison troops—reduce your 35,000 by 500 here, 800 there, and suddenly your field army is 25,000 while the Ottomans can still field fresh troops.\"\n\nHe pauses, then meets your eyes directly.\n\n\"Fifth challenge: Fortress warfare. The Balkans are dotted with Ottoman fortresses—Belgrade, Sofia, Plovdiv, dozens of smaller strongholds. Each one requires siege operations. Even with excellent artillery and tactics, reducing a major fortress takes weeks or months. The Ottomans will use this to delay you, force you to disperse your forces, and attack when you're vulnerable. You cannot just march past them—they'll raid your supplies and attack from behind.\"\n\nHunyadi straightens, and his tone shifts from cautionary to determined.\n\n\"But, Your Majesty—and this is crucial—none of these challenges are insurmountable. They are difficult. They require planning, resources, coordination, and sustained will. But they are solvable problems, not impossible barriers.\"\n\nHe gestures emphatically.\n\n\"If you can assemble a league of Christian kingdoms committed to contributing troops and money for a decade... if you can establish unified command with real authority... if you can build the logistical infrastructure to supply such a force through Hungary... if you can train enough officers here and in other academies to command professionally...\"\n\n\"Then yes. 35,000 to 40,000 disciplined, well-led, well-supplied Christian troops could absolutely drive the Ottomans from the Balkans. Not in one campaign. Not in two. But in five to eight years of sustained operations? Absolutely.\"\n\nHis voice drops, becoming intense.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I have been fighting them for ten years with 8,000 to 15,000 troops—poorly coordinated, short-term levies, minimal supplies. And we've held. We've bloodied them. We've won battles. Imagine what we could do with 35,000 professionals sustained for years.\"\n\nHe looks at you with something approaching reverence.\n\n\"The question isn't whether 35,000 disciplined troops could do it. The question is: Can you actually assemble and sustain such a force? Can you convince Hungary, Poland, and others to commit for a decade? Can you maintain the financial burden? Can you keep Christendom united long enough to finish what you start?\"\n\n\"Because if you can—if you truly can—then you're not talking about defending Constantinople. You're talking about reversing 150 years of Ottoman expansion. You're talking about liberating the Balkans, restoring Christian rule to Serbia, Bulgaria, perhaps even Greece.\"\n\nHe bows his head slightly.\n\n\"Tell me you're serious, Your Majesty. Tell me this isn't just enthusiasm from a young king who conquered one emirate. Tell me you understand this will consume decades of your life, require sacrifices from your kingdom, and might not even be completed in your lifetime.\"\n\n\"Because if you're truly committed to this—if you mean it—then I will dedicate everything I have to making it happen. I will train your officers. I will coordinate with Hungarian forces. I will help you plan every detail of this campaign.\"\n\n\"But I need to know: Are you ready for what this truly requires?\"\n\nHe looks at you, waiting for your answer."

          "text": "1. Makes a joke about marriage commitments\n2. Acknowledges he doesn't make promises lightly\n3. Admits he's still determining if the Ottoman campaign is truly feasible\n4. Reaffirms his general commitment to being a \"soldier for Christ\"\n5. Tells Hunyadi not to commit himself too quickly to a king he just met\n6. Slaps him on the shoulder (friendly gesture)\n7. Asks to learn more about Ottoman tactics\n8. Spends time with Janos then returns to Isabel\n\nThis is very good character work - Juan is enthusiastic but not reckless, ambitious but realistic, willing to dream big but not making promises he can't keep. It shows maturity.\n\nI should:\n1. Have Hunyadi respond to this with respect and some relief (Juan is serious but not naive)\n2. Show a brief scene of them discussing Ottoman tactics\n3. Then transition to Juan returning to Isabel\n4. Keep it concise and end the scene appropriately\n\nThe tone should be warm, professional, building mutual respect without over-committing.\n\nHunyadi blinks, then laughs—a genuine, surprised laugh that breaks the intensity of the moment.\n\n\"A wife? No, Your Majesty. I've been too busy bleeding for Christendom to convince any woman I'd make a good husband. Perhaps after we save Constantinople, if I survive.\"\n\nThe slap on his shoulder seems to ground him, bring him back from the edge of fervent commitment to something more human.\n\n\"You're right. You're absolutely right.\" He shakes his head, almost ruefully. \"Forgive me—I spent ten years begging for help that never came, and suddenly a king who actually does things appears. I got carried away.\"\n\nHe relaxes visibly, his posture shifting from intense advocate to thoughtful instructor.\n\n\"Determining if it can be done—that's wisdom, not hesitation. And not committing until you know? That's how a real king thinks, not a dreamer.\" He gestures back to the sand table. \"Come then. Let me show you what makes the Ottomans so dangerous—and where their weaknesses lie.\"\n\nFor the next hour, Hunyadi walks you through Ottoman tactics with the precision of someone who's learned every lesson in blood. He demonstrates their cavalry tactics, their use of janissary infantry, how they coordinate different troop types, their approach to sieges and counter-sieges. He's an excellent teacher—clear, practical, answering your questions without condescension.\n\n\"The key,\" he says at one point, \"is that they fight as a system. Every part supports the others. We Christians often fight as a collection of brave individuals. That's why we lose.\"\n\nHe shows you several scenarios where disciplined Christian forces defeated larger Ottoman armies, and others where undisciplined courage led to disaster. The maps, the wooden pieces, the sand sketches—all of it paints a picture of warfare as craft rather than just courage.\n\nFinally, as the afternoon sun begins to slant through the windows, you notice the time.\n\n\"I should return to the Alcázar,\" you say. \"My wife will be wondering where I've disappeared to.\"\n\nHunyadi bows. \"Thank you for your time, Your Majesty. And for your honesty. I prefer a king who says 'I'm still determining what's possible' over one who makes grand promises he can't keep.\"\n\n\"We will meet again,\" you assure him. \"There's much more to discuss. But for now—continue the work here. Train these officers well. Everything else depends on having commanders who understand what you've taught me today.\"\n\n\"It will be done, Your Majesty.\"\n\nRETURN TO THE ALCÁZAR\n\nYour escort reforms around you as you leave the academy. The ride back through Toledo's streets is brief—the academy is close to the royal complex. Citizens bow as you pass, some calling out blessings for the conquest of Granada.\n\nThe Alcázar gates open, and you dismount in the courtyard. A servant hurries forward.\n\n\"Your Majesty, the Queen is in her chambers with the Princess.\"\n\nYou make your way through familiar corridors, climbing the stairs to the royal apartments. The door to Isabel's chambers stands slightly ajar, and you can hear soft singing—Isabel's voice, gentle and Portuguese, singing what sounds like a lullaby.\n\nYou push the door open quietly.\n\nIsabel sits in a chair by the window, late afternoon sunlight streaming across her and the baby in her arms. Catalina is nursing, one small hand resting on Isabel's chest, dark eyes half-closed in contentment. Isabel rocks gently as she sings, her face peaceful.\n\nShe looks up as you enter, and her expression transforms—surprise, then joy, then something softer.\n\n\"You're back,\" she says quietly, careful not to disturb Catalina. \"I thought you'd be gone all afternoon.\""

          "text": "1. Consider the historical and medical factors\n2. Be realistic about medieval fertility rates and Isabel's specific situation\n3. Create a table that accounts for:\n   - Her age (16-17)\n   - Her recent traumatic childbirth (10 months ago)\n   - The physicians' assessment that future pregnancies are \"very risky\"\n   - Her recovered health\n   - Frequency of intimacy\n   - Natural fertility cycles\n   - Medieval medical knowledge limitations\n\nThe timeframe is late November/early December 1432. We need to determine if/when she conceives.\n\nI should create a table that:\n- Has realistic probabilities based on medieval fertility rates\n- Accounts for her medical history\n- Considers the timing of conception\n- Is historically grounded\n\nThis is appropriate for the historical RPG context where succession and heirs are politically crucial elements.\n\nGM MODE: ISABEL PREGNANCY ASSESSMENT TABLE\n\nLet me evaluate the relevant factors for Isabel's fertility situation in late November/December 1432:\n\nCONCEPTION-FAVORABLE FACTORS:\n\nAge 16-17 - Peak fertility years for medieval women\n\nProven fertility - Already conceived and carried to term once\n\nPhysical recovery complete - 10 months post-partum, physicians confirmed full recovery\n\nRegular intimacy - Juan present and relationship strong\n\nGood health - No ongoing medical issues\n\nAdequate nutrition - Royal diet, not malnourished\n\nNo contraception - Obviously, in 1432\n\nStrong motivation - Both desire an heir (especially male)\n\nCONCEPTION-INHIBITING FACTORS:\n\nTrauma history - Near-death experience may cause psychological stress affecting cycles\n\nInternal damage - Physicians noted \"extensive internal damage\" from breech birth\n\nNursing Catalina - Breastfeeding can delay return to fertility (though not reliable)\n\nFear and anxiety - Psychological factors can affect conception\n\n\"Very risky\" assessment - Suggests potential physiological complications\n\nOnly 10 months post-partum - Body may not be fully ready despite recovery\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT:\n\nMedieval fertility rates: ~20-30% chance per cycle for healthy couples\n\nAfter difficult birth: Reduced fertility common due to internal scarring/damage\n\nBreastfeeding effect: Variable, not reliable contraception\n\nAge factor: 16-17 is optimal fertility age, increases likelihood\n\nD100 TABLE: ISABEL CONCEPTION OUTCOME\n\n01-25: NO CONCEPTION (Most Likely Outcome - 25%)\n\nInternal damage from traumatic birth affecting fertility more than apparent\n\nNursing Catalina suppressing ovulation\n\nPsychological anxiety affecting cycles\n\nSimply normal variance—not every cycle results in conception\n\nMay take 6-12 months of trying before conception occurs\n\nPhysicians' \"very risky\" warning was more serious than realized\n\n26-50: DELAYED CONCEPTION (Moderate Likelihood - 25%)\n\nConceives within 2-4 months (February-April 1433)\n\nBody needed more recovery time than physicians realized\n\nEarly attempts unsuccessful due to nursing/stress\n\nOnce those factors diminish, natural fertility returns\n\nPregnancy confirmed spring 1433\n\nChild born late 1433/early 1434\n\n51-70: CONCEPTION WITHIN 1-2 MONTHS (Realistic Chance - 20%)\n\nConceives in December 1432 or January 1433\n\nBody recovered well despite trauma\n\nNursing not significantly suppressing fertility\n\nAge and proven fertility overcome complications\n\nPregnancy confirmed by late February 1433\n\nChild born autumn 1433\n\n71-85: IMMEDIATE CONCEPTION (Lower Probability - 15%)\n\nConceives in late November/early December 1432\n\nOptimal timing with ovulation cycle\n\nBody fully recovered and fertility strong\n\nYouth and health overcome previous complications\n\nPregnancy confirmed by late January 1433\n\nChild born late summer/early autumn 1433\n\n86-95: CONCEPTION BUT COMPLICATIONS AHEAD (10%)\n\nConceives within 1-2 months\n\nInitial pregnancy proceeds normally\n\nHowever, internal damage creates risks:\nPotential miscarriage risk (15-20% in first trimester)\n\nPlacental positioning issues possible\n\nLabor complications likely to recur\n\nWill require careful medical monitoring\n\nPhysicians' warnings prove prescient\n\n96-100: TWINS CONCEIVED (Very Rare - 5%)\n\nFraternal twins conceived (occurs naturally ~1 in 80 births)\n\nExtremely dangerous given Isabel's medical history\n\nMedieval survival rate for mother with twins after traumatic first birth: 50-60%\n\nPhysicians will be very concerned when discovered\n\nMajor plot/medical crisis ahead\n\nBut if successful: solves succession dramatically\n\nADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nIf Conception Occurs:\n\nWon't be confirmed for 6-8 weeks (missed cycles, physical signs)\n\nMorning sickness typically starts week 6-8\n\nMedieval pregnancy tests: observing urine color, physical changes, quickening (4-5 months)\n\nIsabel's fear will be intense given previous trauma\n\nJuan's presence/absence during pregnancy will matter significantly\n\nIf No Conception:\n\nNot unusual—many healthy couples take months\n\nPsychological pressure might increase\n\nQuestion of whether to keep trying or wait longer\n\nPolitical pressure for male heir will grow\n\nSuccession concerns with only Catalina\n\nMedical Realities:\n\n\"Very risky\" means real dangers: uterine scarring, cervical damage, increased miscarriage risk, potential for repeat breech/complications\n\nMedieval obstetrics couldn't predict or prevent many complications\n\nEven if she conceives easily, carrying to term safely is separate question\n\nSecond births after traumatic first often easier—but not guaranteed\n\nRoll when ready. This determines Isabel's conception status going forward into 1433."

          "text": "This is important to track but won't be immediately apparent to Juan yet - it's only been a day or so since he returned on November 28th. They had intercourse on November 29th and again today (November 30th). Conception would occur sometime in the next 1-2 months.\n\nNow Juan is going back to Álvaro to check on the tasks he assigned earlier in the chapter - the invitations, Sierra Nevada commanders, artillery movement, crusader concentration, and land grant preparation.\n\nYou find Álvaro in his working chambers, surrounded by documents and three clerks busily writing. Diego de Daza is also present, reviewing ledgers. Both look up as you enter.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Álvaro rises, gesturing to the organized chaos around him. \"Perfect timing. We've made excellent progress on your instructions.\"\n\nHe moves to his main desk where several neat stacks of parchment are arranged.\n\n\"Let me walk you through what's been accomplished in the past day and a half since our council meeting.\"\n\nTHE INVITATIONS\n\nÁlvaro lifts the first stack—four elaborate documents with wax seals ready to be pressed.\n\n\"The formal invitations to the Te Deum ceremony in Granada, late April 1433. I've drafted them for your review before dispatch.\"\n\nHe spreads them before you:\n\n1. To King João I of Portugal\n\"Your Majesty's presence would honor the completion of the Reconquista, a cause to which the Portuguese crown has contributed so significantly through alliance, support, and the sacred union of our houses through your daughter, my beloved wife Queen Isabel...\"\n\n2. To King Carlos of Navarre (and Infante Juan as Regent)\n\"To His Majesty King Carlos and his noble father Infante Juan de Aragón, whose service in the Granada crusade contributed directly to our victory, we extend invitation to witness the culmination of seven centuries of Christian effort...\"\n\n3. To Queen María of Aragon and King Alfonso V\n\"To our beloved sister Queen María and her husband King Alfonso V of Aragon—understanding completely that His Majesty's demanding matters of state in Italy and Aragon may prevent his attendance, we would be deeply honored if Her Majesty would represent Aragon's spiritual contribution to this holy triumph. Should His Majesty's schedule permit his presence, we would be equally honored, but we take comfort that Aragon's role in completing the Reconquista will be recognized and celebrated through the attendance of our sister, whom we have missed dearly...\"\n\nÁlvaro looks at you. \"The wording for Aragon is exactly as you specified—gracious to Alfonso, ensuring María's attendance, no awkwardness with the Infantes. If you approve these, they'll be dispatched tomorrow morning by fastest couriers. Portugal should receive within a week, Navarre ten days, Aragon two weeks depending on whether they must forward to Naples.\"\n\nSIERRA NEVADA COMMANDERS\n\n\"Don García López de Padilla received comprehensive instructions yesterday via courier,\" Álvaro continues, moving to another document. \"He is to issue formal summons to all fortress commanders in the Sierra Nevada for an assembly in Granada, scheduled for early March—specifically March 5th.\"\n\nHe reads from his notes: \"The three commanders who haven't yet responded, plus five others we want to assess personally. The summons is under banner of truce, framed as an honor—invitation to swear fealty and receive confirmation of their positions under the new governance structure.\"\n\n\"Don García will emphasize: they haven't been summoned until now, so no offense taken for any delay. But now they are officially called, and their response will determine how we proceed. He'll extend the invitation graciously but make clear that non-attendance would be... noted.\"\n\n\"Timeline: Summons dispatched from Granada by mid-December, commanders receive by late December, six weeks to travel down from the mountains and prepare, assembly March 5th. That gives us seven weeks before the Te Deum to handle any defiance—plenty of time to bring military force if needed.\"\n\nARTILLERY MOVEMENT\n\nDiego speaks up: \"Master Gunner Pietro Calabrese received orders this morning. All five bombards are to be prepared for transport to Granada as soon as weather permits.\"\n\n\"Currently they're distributed across winter garrisons—two in Jaén, one in Loja, two in Málaga. Pietro estimates he can begin concentrating them in late January when mountain passes are more reliable, complete the movement by late February. They'll be positioned around Granada by early March, just in time for the fortress commander assembly.\"\n\n\"Purpose served: ready if any commanders prove defiant and require reduction, and impressive display for the visiting monarchs. 'See the artillery that broke every fortress in Granada' has nice diplomatic weight.\"\n\nDiego adds: \"Transport cost approximately 2,000 maravedís per bombard—that's 10,000 total, about 38 florins from the crown treasury. Manageable.\"\n\nCRUSADER CONCENTRATION\n\n\"The 798 sworn crusaders are currently distributed across various garrisons,\" Álvaro explains. \"Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles received orders to begin concentrating them in Granada by mid-March. That gives men time to receive orders, arrange affairs, and travel.\"\n\n\"These men took their oaths before the sacred relics and white banner. They should witness the crusade's formal conclusion at the Te Deum, then accompany you to Rome to return those relics—a fitting end to their service. After Rome, we can offer them the choice to continue to Basel or return home with their land grants.\"\n\n\"Logistically: 800 men concentrated in Granada requires provisions and quarters, but Don García can manage that. Cost is minimal since they're already on payroll.\"\n\nLAND GRANTS PREPARATION\n\nDiego stands and spreads a large map of Granada on the table—detailed, showing rivers, settlements, agricultural zones.\n\n\"This is the most complex task, Your Majesty. We're preparing approximately 750-800 land grants. I've already hired surveying teams—thirty men drawn from the crusade tax assessment program, exactly as you suggested. They know how to survey, assess value, document property.\"\n\nHe points to regions on the map:\n\n\"For common crusaders (~700 grants):\nWe're focusing on the Vega of Granada—the fertile plain surrounding the city—and the river valleys leading toward Málaga and Almería. These areas have established irrigation, good soil, existing agricultural infrastructure. Each grant will be 50-100 acres depending on land quality.\"\n\n\"For noble crusaders (~50-100 grants):\nLarger estates of 500-2,000 acres, including some income-producing properties—villages, mills, olive groves. We're prioritizing strategic locations and properties that can support a minor noble household.\"\n\n\"Process:\nSurvey teams deployed to Granada next week. They'll work through January, February, and March marking boundaries, assessing quality, preparing title documents. Everything bulletproof legally—no ambiguities that could cause future disputes.\"\n\n\"Complications we're managing:\n\nMuslim families currently occupying some lands: We're handling this carefully. Properties with existing Muslim tenant farmers will transfer with tenants in place—the crusader becomes the landlord, but the farmers continue working. Properties where Muslim owners exist will be compensated modestly and relocated to designated areas. No forced expulsions without somewhere to go.\n\nInfrastructure needs: Some properties need work—irrigation repair, building construction. We're noting this in the titles so crusaders know what they're getting.\n\nQuality distribution: Making sure every crusader gets genuinely productive land, not just empty desert. Better properties for those with distinguished service, but nobody gets cheated.\"\n\nDiego looks up from the map. \"Cost for the entire surveying and documentation program: approximately 18,000 maravedís—about 68 florins from crown treasury. Work will be complete by late March, ready to distribute at or shortly after the Te Deum.\"\n\nGRANADA PREPARATION FOR TE DEUM\n\n\"Finally,\" Álvaro says, \"Don García is coordinating with Archbishop Gutiérrez on preparing the Grand Mosque—now cathedral—for the ceremony. The Archbishop's reconsecration is scheduled for Christmas Day as planned, but he'll have four additional months to make it truly magnificent for hosting all of Iberia's rulers.\"\n\n\"Don García also needs to prepare accommodations: King João will bring 100-200 attendants, each court similar. He'll need resources for hospitality, security, protocol. I've authorized him to spend up to 5,000 maravedís preparing Granada to receive royal visitors—about 19 florins.\"\n\nÁlvaro straightens, looking satisfied but tired.\n\n\"Summary, Your Majesty:\n\nInvitations: Ready for your seal and signature, dispatch tomorrow\n\nSierra Nevada commanders: Summons being issued, assembly March 5th\n\nArtillery: Moving late January/February, positioned by early March\n\nCrusaders: Concentrating mid-March, present for ceremony\n\nLand grants: Survey teams deployed next week, complete by late March\n\nGranada preparation: Underway, Archbishop and Don García coordinating\n\nTotal costs: Approximately 125 florins from crown treasury for all operations—well within budget.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"Everything is proceeding as you commanded, Your Majesty. The Te Deum in late April will be ready. Is there anything you wish to adjust or add?\""

\"No offense taken for delay\" gives face-saving way to comply\n\nBanner of truce - Safety guaranteed, not a trap\n\nPosition confirmation offered - Can keep their commands under Christian authority\n\nOther territories submitted peacefully - Precedent shows compliance works (Chapter 39, Roll 27)\n\nOverwhelming force available - 5 bombards, 800 crusaders, can reduce any fortress\n\nDon García's reasonable reputation - Known as fair military governor\n\nWinter to reflect - Three months of isolation to consider reality\n\nEconomic pressure - No trade, no supplies, no support network\n\nFamilies potentially in Granada - Sultan's old hostage system may still bind them\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nPride and honor - Surrendering is humiliating, especially after holding out\n\nMountain fortresses highly defensible - Geography favors defense\n\nReligious zealotry - Some may prefer martyrdom to submission\n\nDistrust of Christians - Despite assurances, fear of treatment\n\nThree months to prepare - Time to fortify and gather supplies for resistance\n\nLoss of status - Under Christian rule, Muslim commanders reduced in power\n\nFear it's a trap - Despite banner of truce, paranoia about intentions\n\nHardliner commanders - Some individuals simply won't bend\n\nIsolation breeds defiance - Mountain communities develop their own logic\n\nNo face-to-face negotiation yet -

SIGNIFICANT RESISTANCE (15%)\n\n5 commanders accept summons and come to Granada\n\n3 commanders refuse - two citing religious reasons, one claiming fortress too remote to leave\n\nThose who refuse are hardliners, well-supplied, prepared for siege\n\nThose who accept provide intelligence on resisters\n\nPartial success but military action still required\n\n1-2 month campaign to reduce three fortresses\n\nArtillery sufficient for the task\n\nModerate casualties: 30-80 troops\n\nCost: 8,000-15,000 florins\n\nCan likely complete before Te Deum\n\n31-50: MOSTLY COMPLIANT - MINOR RESISTANCE (20%)\n\n6-7 commanders accept summons and travel to Granada\n\n1-2 commanders don't respond initially - may be communication issues, may be reluctance\n\nDon García sends second delegation with ultimatum\n\nHoldouts either comply after second contact or prove to be minor fortresses that can be bypassed\n\nMinimal military action required -

I still need to finish the crusade and will have to visit Rome to honour my obligations.

          "text": "1. Tone should be respectful but confident - Juan is a conquering crusader-king\n2. Should reference the positive reception of the Castilian delegation\n3. Should explain the delay (crusade completion, Rome obligations) as legitimate priorities\n4. Should confirm commitment to attend\n5. Should indicate what he wants to address (Constantinople aid, worldly matters)\n6. Should maintain the balanced position between papal and conciliar factions\n7. Timeline would be: Te Deum late April, Rome May-June, Basel June-July\n\nÁlvaro would want to make sure this letter:\n- Doesn't seem like Juan is choosing Council over Pope (by going to Rome first)\n- Builds anticipation for his attendance\n- References the delegation's success\n- Maintains diplomatic flexibility\n- Commits firmly enough to be taken seriously but with appropriate caveats\n\nLet me have Álvaro respond thoughtfully to this proposal.\n\nÁlvaro considers this carefully, then nods slowly.\n\n\"An excellent idea, Your Majesty. Your personal attendance will carry enormous weight—Cardinal Cesarini specifically requested it in his letter. But the framing and timing of your announcement is critical.\"\n\nHe pulls a fresh sheet of parchment toward him and begins making notes.\n\n\"Let me think through the diplomatic implications. First, the positive aspects of what you've just outlined:\"\n\nSTRENGTHS OF YOUR APPROACH:\n\n\"One: Going to Rome first demonstrates you respect papal authority and fulfill your crusade vows before engaging in church politics. The radical conciliarists at Basel can't claim you've chosen Council over Pope.\n\nTwo: Framing it as 'important matters of state must be concluded' and 'obligations to Rome' makes your delay sound principled and inevitable, not dismissive of Basel's importance.\n\nThree: Arriving after your delegation has established Castile's positions means you're coming to reinforce and expand on success, not starting from scratch.\n\nFour: Announcing you want to address Constantinople aid directly creates anticipation—everyone knows you just completed a crusade, so your military commitments carry actual weight.\n\nFive: The phrase 'worldly matters' is diplomatically useful—lets you address practical military and political questions without getting dragged into purely theological disputes between factions.\"\n\nHe pauses, tapping his quill thoughtfully.\n\n\"However, there are some considerations for the letter's exact wording. May I suggest a few refinements?\"\n\nDRAFT LETTER STRUCTURE:\n\nÁlvaro begins outlining:\n\n\"Opening: Greetings to Cardinal Cesarini and the assembled prelates, acknowledging the Council's important work and expressing gratitude for the reception of Castile's delegation.\n\nContext: Brief mention of Granada's conquest—'By God's grace, the Reconquista is complete'—establishing your credentials without boasting.\n\nThe Crusade Completion Requirement: Explain that the papal bull requires formal conclusion with a Te Deum in conquered territory before crusaders can be released from vows. This is not optional—it's a sacred obligation you must fulfill. Frame it as respecting the very church authority Basel seeks to preserve.\n\nRome Obligations: State that upon completing the crusade, you must travel to Rome to return the sacred relics loaned for the campaign and to present the crusade's accounting to the Holy Father. Again, frame this as honoring commitments and showing proper stewardship.\n\nFirm Commitment to Basel: After fulfilling these sacred duties, you will travel to Basel to address the Council in person. Not 'may' or 'hope to'—will. Make it a definite commitment.\n\nTimeline Indication: Without giving exact dates (which could slip), indicate this will be 'by summer' or 'in the coming months'—soon enough to matter for current deliberations.\n\nTopics You'll Address: Specifically mention Constantinople military support, the practical requirements for mounting effective defense of Eastern Christendom, and Castile's continued commitment to the crusading mission.\n\nDelegation Authority: Reaffirm that your delegation speaks with your voice on theological and ecclesiastical matters already before the Council. You're not coming to override them, but to supplement with military and political dimensions.\n\nClosing: Express hope that by the time you arrive, Basel's negotiations with Bohemia will have succeeded and that reconciliation with the Holy Father will be progressing—subtly positioning yourself as hoping for unity.\"\n\nÁlvaro looks up from his notes.\n\n\"The key, Your Majesty, is to make your attendance sound both inevitable and worth waiting for, while not seeming to lecture the Council or position yourself above church authority. You're a young king who just won a crusade, coming to offer practical military support, not a theologian coming to resolve doctrinal disputes.\"\n\nHe considers further.\n\n\"There's also a subtle strategic element: by announcing now—December—that you'll arrive 'by summer,' you create anticipation that builds over six months. Every time a debate happens about Constantinople or crusading or practical military matters, people will think 'the young king who actually won his crusade will address this when he arrives.' It builds your influence before you even get there.\"\n\n\"Should I draft the letter for your review, Your Majesty? I can have it ready by tomorrow morning, dispatched with the invitations to the Iberian monarchs. It will reach Basel by late January or early February, giving them plenty of notice.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds: \"One additional thought—should we inform Pope Eugenius IV of your intention to attend Basel? Courtesy would suggest we should. We could include a separate letter to Rome explaining that after returning the relics and reporting on the crusade, you'll travel to Basel to address practical military matters regarding Constantinople. Frame it as complementary to papal interests, not choosing sides in the dispute.\"\n\nDiego interjects: \"That would demonstrate remarkable diplomatic sophistication, Your Majesty. Most rulers attending Basel don't inform Rome—they just go, which makes it look like they're joining the conciliar faction. By openly informing both Rome and Basel of your intentions, you maintain your position as honest broker rather than partisan.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"So—two letters, then? One to Basel announcing your coming attendance, one to Pope Eugenius informing him of the same and assuring him you remain his faithful son despite engaging with the Council? That would be the most diplomatically sound approach.\"\n\nHe looks at you expectantly. \"What are your thoughts, Your Majesty? Should I proceed with drafting both letters?\""

I'll have both letters ready by morning, along with the invitations to the Iberian monarchs. All can be dispatched together—the couriers to Basel and Rome will depart at the same time.\"\n\nHe makes quick notes. \"The Basel letter will go to Cardinal Cesarini as presiding legate, with copies to the Council secretariat. The Rome letter directly to His Holiness Pope Eugenius IV. Both will be sealed with your royal seal and carry full credentials.\"\n\nDiego begins organizing the materials they'll need. \"I'll prepare the finest parchment and ensure the seals are properly prepared. Letters of this importance deserve appropriate presentation.\"\n\nÁlvaro looks up. \"I'll work through the evening to have everything ready for your review first thing tomorrow morning, Your Majesty. You can read both letters, make any adjustments you wish, then seal them for dispatch. The couriers can leave by mid-morning.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds with a slight smile: \"Your Majesty, this is... remarkable diplomacy. In one stroke, you're announcing attendance at the most contentious church council in decades while maintaining loyalty to the Pope, scheduling visits to both Rome and Basel, hosting all Iberian monarchs for a historic ceremony, and preparing to return hundreds of thousands of florins to the Church. All while completing a crusade that took 710 years.\"\n\n\"Most kings would spend a lifetime accomplishing one of these things. You're twenty years old and doing them simultaneously.\"\n\nDiego chuckles. \"And finding time to visit the military academy and check on artillery movements.\"\n\nÁlvaro shakes his head with something like wonder. \"The pace you maintain, Your Majesty... I hope you're not planning anything else major before year's end? We have barely four weeks until 1433.\"\n\nHe's clearly half-joking, but there's genuine curiosity in his question—as if waiting to see what other plans might emerge.\n\nIs there anything else you wish to address with Álvaro and Diego before tomorrow morning's letter review, Your Majesty? Or shall we move to the next day when the letters are ready for your seal?"
