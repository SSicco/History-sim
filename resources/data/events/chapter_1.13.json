I'll describe the atmosphere of Toledo, the preparations, and set the scene beautifully.\n\nCHAPTER 13: THE UNION OF KINGDOMS\n\nFebruary 15, 1431\nToledo, Kingdom of Castile\n\nDawn of a Sacred Day\n\nThe first light of dawn crept through the narrow windows of the Royal Alcázar, casting pale bands of gold across the stone floors. Toledo stirred to life with unusual energy—the city had been awake half the night, it seemed, with anticipation and preparation. Every street, every plaza, every inn overflowed with nobility from across Castile, their banners hanging from balconies, their guards filling the squares. The city had not seen such a gathering in living memory.\n\nIn the royal chambers, the morning began before sunrise. The soft knock at the door came precisely at the appointed hour—servants entering with hushed reverence, carrying water heated for washing, fresh linens, and the ceremonial garments prepared for the day. The room smelled of lavender and beeswax from the candles that had burned through the night in the small chapel adjacent to the bedchamber.\n\nThrough the window, Toledo spread below in the pre-dawn gloom—a sea of terracotta roofs, church spires piercing upward, the Tagus River curving around the city like a protective arm. Somewhere in those streets, the cathedral bells would soon begin their call to the most significant Mass the kingdom had witnessed in years.\n\nThe chief chamberlain, an elderly man named Don Rodrigo de Villalobos, supervised the preparations with military precision. Behind him, three younger servants waited with various elements of the ceremonial dress—but not the armor. That would come later, at the appointed moment.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Don Rodrigo said quietly, bowing. \"The city awaits. Princess Isabel has been awake for two hours already—her Portuguese ladies report she has barely eaten, too nervous. Cardinal Capranica is at the cathedral, overseeing the final arrangements. The Guardian Company has been at vigil with the banner and relics since midnight.\" He paused. \"It is time to begin preparations.\"\n\nThe morning routine would be extensive. First, the ritual cleansing and dressing in the white linen undergarments. Then the formal doublet and hose, embroidered with the royal arms. Only after the procession to the cathedral would come the moment all of Toledo waited to see—the donning of the white armor before the cathedral doors.\n\nOutside, the city continued to wake. Market vendors hawked fresh bread and wine to the crowds already gathering along the processional route. Children darted between adults' legs, trying to secure the best viewing positions. Guards from a dozen noble houses stood at attention outside their lords' temporary residences. And in every church across Toledo, bells began their morning call—not in the usual pattern, but in a cascading celebration that rolled across the city like waves.\n\nDon Rodrigo gestured to the servants, who approached with basin and cloth.\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

At the cathedral I dismount and take off my helmet and enter the cathedral with Isabel in my armour. Then we have tha mass and the wedding and then we go outside to the plaza where another blessing will take place so everyone can see us. During the mass, the banner and relics are revealed for the first time to the public. After the ceremony on the plaza, the banner is carried outside where it is being held at attention above the fifty crusaders. This is a call for more volunteers.\n\n\nThen we do a tour around the city and in the evening we have a dinner with nobles where the taxation is officially announced. I ready the realm for war.\n\n\nI get ready by donning my armour at the palace.\n\n\nRemember that My outfit is plain all-white without a red cross or any emblem. My banners likewise are just plain while but with texture accents at most, like the banner which is also white with no emblem or sign."

          "text": "February 15, 1431 - Dawn\nRoyal Alcázar, Toledo\n\nThe Armoring\n\nDon Rodrigo nodded at Juan's instruction and immediately dispatched servants. \"Summon Master Gonzalo at once. And clear the great hall—His Majesty will arm there, not in the cathedral plaza.\"\n\nWithin minutes, the great hall had been transformed into an armory. Servants carried in the pieces with reverence—the polished Milan plate gleaming even in the dim morning light, each piece wrapped in linen to prevent scratching during transport. Master Gonzalo himself arrived, slightly breathless, his apprentices behind him carrying the specialized padding and additional equipment.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" the master armorer bowed deeply. \"The privilege of arming you on this day...\" He gestured to his apprentices, who began laying out the pieces in precise order on a long table draped in white cloth.\n\nThe process was methodical, almost ritual. First came the arming doublet—quilted linen designed to cushion the armor's weight and absorb the shock of any blows. Then the leg harness: greaves strapped over the shins, poleyns protecting the knees, cuisses buckled around the thighs. Each piece was masterwork—smooth, articulated, fitted so perfectly that movement felt almost natural despite the weight.\n\nÁlvaro entered quietly, watching the process with an expression that mixed pride and something deeper—perhaps the weight of what this day meant. He said nothing, simply took a position near the window where he could observe without interfering.\n\nThe breastplate came next, the most magnificent piece. Master Gonzalo and two apprentices lifted it carefully, settling it onto Juan's shoulders. The armorer's fingers moved with practiced expertise, threading leather straps through buckles, testing the fit, ensuring every articulation point allowed full range of motion. The backplate followed, enclosing the torso in a shell of gleaming steel.\n\n\"Raise your arms, Your Majesty,\" Master Gonzalo murmured, testing the shoulder articulation. \"Now forward, as if drawing a sword. Good. The fit is perfect.\"\n\nThe arm harness came piece by piece—vambraces on the forearms, couters at the elbows, rerebrace on the upper arms. Each piece connected to the next with precision-engineered sliding rivets that allowed the arm to bend, extend, twist naturally. Gauntlets followed, the fingers articulated so delicately that Juan could still grip effectively despite the steel encasing his hands.\n\nThe gorget was placed last among the body pieces—a collar of steel that protected the throat while allowing the head to turn. Master Gonzalo stepped back, examining his work critically, then nodded in satisfaction.\n\n\"The helm, if Your Majesty pleases.\"\n\nAn apprentice brought forward the great bascinet with its distinctive white plume. Not the cheap-dyed horsehair plumes of common knights, but something finer—white egret feathers, perhaps, long and flowing. The helmet was fitted with careful attention, the chin strap secured, the visor tested to ensure it raised and lowered smoothly.\n\nFinally, over all of it, the white surcoat—pure white linen without device or emblem, falling to mid-thigh. The fabric had been specially treated to hold its shape while still allowing the armor's lines to show through.\n\nThe effect, as Master Gonzalo had predicted weeks before, was extraordinary.\n\nÁlvaro spoke for the first time, his voice quiet. \"You look like the Archangel Michael himself, Your Majesty. God help any man who sees this armor on a battlefield and doesn't feel his courage falter.\"\n\nMaster Gonzalo bowed deeply. \"The greatest work of my life, Your Majesty. May it serve you well in God's war.\"\n\nOutside, the sounds of gathering had intensified. Horses stamping, guards calling orders, the distant roar of crowds already lining the processional route. Don Rodrigo appeared at the doorway.\n\n\"Your Majesty, the company is assembled. Your horse is ready—the white destrier, caparisoned as you ordered. The Guardian Company waits with the banner and relics, prepared to ride in escort. Princess Isabel's procession is forming separately at the Archbishop's palace—she will meet you at the cathedral. The route is lined five deep in places. They've been waiting since before dawn.\"\n\nHe paused, something like awe in his usually formal voice. \"Sire, Toledo has never seen anything like this. When you ride through those streets...\" He shook his head, unable to find words.\n\nFray Hernando entered then, his Franciscan robes somehow looking more dignified than usual. He carried a small vessel of holy water. \"Your Majesty, if I may—a blessing before you ride forth.\"\n\nThe friar's prayer was brief but fervent, calling down divine protection and favor, sanctifying the armor as an instrument of holy purpose. When he finished, he made the sign of the cross over Juan's breastplate with his thumb.\n\n\"You ride to your wedding, Your Majesty, but also to the beginning of God's work. May He grant you strength for both.\"\n\nIn the courtyard, Juan's destrier waited—a massive white warhorse, seventeen hands high, its coat gleaming from hours of grooming. The caparison that covered it was pure white linen, falling almost to its hooves, without device or heraldry. The saddle beneath was the finest leather, padded for comfort during the long procession, but military in design—this was a warhorse, not a palfrey.\n\nThe Guardian Company was mounted and ready—fifty crusaders on horseback, their white tabards brilliant in the growing morning light, red crosses stark against the fabric. They held themselves with absolute discipline, lances upright, faces solemn. At their center, borne by four of their number on a specially constructed frame, was the banner itself—white silk rippling slightly in the morning breeze, the texture of its weave catching the light. No devices, no heraldry, just pure white. Beside the banner rode two crusaders carrying the reliquaries containing the fragments of the True Cross and Saint James's bone, each encased in gold and silver that glinted like fire.\n\nBehind them, the royal household guard—thirty knights in polished armor, the royal standard of Castile (quarterly castles and lions) borne among them to represent the crown's temporal authority alongside the crusade's spiritual purity.\n\nThe city beyond the palace gates roared with anticipation.\n\nDon Rodrigo approached, holding the reins of the destrier. \"Your Majesty, all is ready. The route will take you down from the Alcázar through the Plaza de Zocodover, along the Calle del Comercio through the heart of the city, and up to the cathedral plaza. Perhaps thirty minutes if we maintain processional pace. The crowds...\" He shook his head again. \"You will see, Your Majesty.\"\n\nÁlvaro mounted his own horse—a black destrier nearly as impressive as Juan's own, though caparisoned in the blue and gold of his house. He positioned himself at Juan's right hand, where the Constable of Castile belonged.\n\nThe gates of the Alcázar stood open. Beyond them, Toledo waited.\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

          "text": "The Mounting\n\nA mounting block had been positioned beside the destrier—even for an experienced rider, mounting in full plate armor required assistance. Two grooms steadied the horse while Juan placed his gauntleted hand on the saddle's high cantle. The weight of the armor was substantial, but the perfectly balanced distribution and Master Gonzalo's precise fitting allowed fluid movement. With one smooth motion, Juan swung up into the saddle, settling into position with the practiced ease of a knight who'd been riding since childhood.\n\nThe destrier shifted slightly under the added weight, but held steady—a true warhorse, trained to bear both armored rider and the chaos of battle without flinching.\n\nMaster Gonzalo's apprentices immediately moved forward with the banner poles. There were two of them, designed to attach to special reinforced brackets welded to the saddle's frame on either side, just behind Juan's legs. Each pole was perhaps nine feet in total length—the first foot secured in the bracket, leaving eight feet rising above.\n\nThe white silk banners attached to these poles were long and narrow, perhaps two feet wide and six feet long, designed to stream backward as the horse moved. The fabric was finest silk, light enough to catch even gentle air movement, but treated to hold its shape and prevent tangling. No devices, no emblems—just pure white with subtle texture woven into the fabric that caught light in shifting patterns.\n\nThe apprentices worked carefully, sliding the first pole into its bracket with a solid click as it locked into place. Then the second on the opposite side. The poles rose high above Juan's head, the banners hanging almost still in the relatively calm morning air of the courtyard.\n\n\"Test the balance, Your Majesty,\" Master Gonzalo advised. \"The poles are counterweighted, but movement will tell you if anything needs adjustment.\"\n\nJuan gathered the reins, feeling the leather through his articulated gauntlets. The destrier responded immediately to the subtle pressure of his knees—well-trained, responsive despite the unusual cargo it now bore. He urged the horse forward into a slow walk, then turned it in a wide circle around the courtyard.\n\nThe effect was immediate and spectacular.\n\nAs the horse moved, even at a walk, the banners caught the air and began to stream backward. The higher pace increased the effect—the white silk unfurling fully, flowing behind like wings of white fire. The texture in the fabric created shifting patterns of light and shadow as it rippled, making the banners seem almost alive, almost luminous.\n\nJuan urged the destrier to a slow trot, completing another circle. The banners now fully extended, streaming eight feet behind him at shoulder height, the white silk brilliant in the morning sun that had begun to break over Toledo's walls. The poles held perfectly steady in their brackets, the engineering sound. The overall silhouette was exactly as Master Gonzalo had envisioned—a mounted knight in pure white armor, white plumes on his helm, white surcoat, white banners flowing like angel's wings, on a white destrier.\n\nÁlvaro's jaw had literally dropped. \"Madre de Dios,\" he breathed. \"Your Majesty... when the people see this...\"\n\nFray Hernando had tears in his eyes. \"Saint Michael,\" he whispered. \"The Archangel himself descending to make war on the infidel.\"\n\nEven the hardened household guards were staring, their usual professional composure broken. One crossed himself rapidly. Another muttered a prayer under his breath.\n\nThe Guardian Company crusaders sat straighter in their saddles, their faces shining with something beyond mere loyalty—reverence, perhaps, or the kind of faith that moves mountains. They had pledged their lives to this crusade, and now they could see its living symbol before them.\n\nMaster Gonzalo approached, his face showing pride mixed with something deeper. \"Perfect, Your Majesty. The balance holds, the brackets are secure, the silk flows freely. You could ride like this into battle itself without hindrance.\" He stepped back, bowing deeply. \"God has granted me the privilege of creating something... something that will be remembered long after I am dust.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo had to clear his throat twice before he could speak. \"Your Majesty, the city awaits. When you ride through those gates...\" He shook his head, seemingly unable to articulate what he felt.\n\nBeyond the palace gates, the roar of the crowd had intensified—they couldn't see into the courtyard yet, but word was spreading somehow through that mysterious osmosis by which crowds sense great events. The sound was building, a low thunder of thousands of voices in anticipation.\n\nThe Guardian Company banner-bearers adjusted their formation, ready to precede Juan. The four carrying the blessed banner on its frame moved to the fore. The two bearing the reliquaries positioned themselves on either side. The remaining crusaders formed an honor guard, lances at precisely the same angle, their discipline absolute.\n\nÁlvaro brought his black destrier alongside Juan's white one. His voice was quiet but intense. \"Your Majesty, when you ride through those streets, you will inspire such faith, such devotion... Men will fight for you. Men will die for you. And they will do it with joy in their hearts, believing they serve God's own champion.\"\n\nHe paused, his usual political calculation giving way to genuine emotion. \"I have served your father and now you. I have seen power wielded in many forms. But this... this is something different. This is the power of faith made visible. Use it well, Your Majesty. Use it to unite this kingdom as it has never been united before.\"\n\nThe destrier stamped, eager to move. The banners rippled with the slight motion, catching light and seeming to glow.\n\nThe gates of the Alcázar stood open. Beyond them, the streets of Toledo surged with humanity. The processional route awaited—a path through the heart of the greatest city in Castile, lined with every noble house, every guild, every religious order, and tens of thousands of common people who had come from across the kingdom to witness this moment.\n\nAt the cathedral, Princess Isabel waited, probably terrified, surrounded by her Portuguese ladies and the Archbishop's household. Cardinal Capranica prepared the High Mass that would join two kingdoms and launch a holy war.\n\nEverything was ready.\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

          "text": "Juan gives the command and rides out. This is the grand processional moment. I need to narrate this with all the novel-like drama and sensory detail it deserves. This is the climactic visual spectacle of the chapter.\n\nKey elements to include:\n- The Guardian Company responding to his command\n- Riding through the gates into the streets\n- The crowd's reaction to seeing him in the white armor with flowing banners\n- The procession through Toledo's streets\n- Specific reactions from different groups (nobles, common people, religious orders)\n- The visual impact of the white banner, relics, Guardian Company, and Juan himself\n- The journey through the city to the cathedral\n- Arrival at the cathedral plaza\n- The crowd there and final approach\n\nI should not write any dialogue or actions for Juan. Just narrate the world's reaction and the journey. End at the cathedral where he would dismount.\n\nThe tone should be epic, reverent, and visually stunning. This is a moment that will be remembered in history. Paint it vividly.\n\nThe Ride of Angels\n\n\"GUARDIANS! WE RIDE!\"\n\nThe command cut through the morning air like a sword stroke. The fifty crusaders responded as one, their voices unified in a thunderous cry: \"FOR CHRIST AND CASTILE!\"\n\nThe Guardian Company surged forward. The four bearing the great white banner on its frame moved first, the silk rippling as they passed through the Alcázar gates. The two with the golden and silver reliquaries followed, the morning sun catching the precious metals and sending shafts of light dancing across the courtyard stones. Then the remaining crusaders, lances upright, white tabards brilliant, red crosses blazing.\n\nJuan urged his destrier forward. The warhorse responded eagerly, powerful muscles gathering beneath white caparison. As they passed through the gates, the banners attached to his saddle caught the breeze and streamed backward—eight feet of pure white silk flowing like wings of fire.\n\nAnd then they emerged into the streets of Toledo.\n\nThe sound hit like a physical force.\n\nThe roar of the crowd was deafening—a wall of noise that seemed to shake the very stones of the ancient city. Thousands upon thousands of voices raised in a cry that was part cheer, part prayer, part something beyond words. The street leading down from the Alcázar was packed on both sides, people pressed five and six deep behind wooden barriers manned by city guards who struggled to hold the lines.\n\nThe moment the white-armored figure on the white horse appeared with those impossible flowing banners, the noise redoubled. Women screamed. Men shouted themselves hoarse. Children were lifted onto shoulders to see better. Some people fell to their knees, crossing themselves frantically. Others simply stared, mouths open, tears streaming down their faces.\n\n\"AN ANGEL! AN ANGEL OF GOD!\"\n\nThe cry came from somewhere in the crowd and spread like wildfire. Within seconds, dozens were shouting it, then hundreds. \"SAINT MICHAEL! SAINT MICHAEL RIDES TO WAR!\"\n\nThe Guardian Company processed ahead, maintaining perfect discipline despite the chaos around them. The blessed banner rippled and caught light, seeming almost to glow in the morning sun. The reliquaries gleamed like stars. The crusaders sat their horses with absolute stillness, but many had tears streaming down their faces beneath their helms, moved beyond words by the faith they witnessed.\n\nJuan rode through it all in full plate, his white plumes streaming, his banners flowing behind him like living things. The destrier's hooves rang on the cobblestones—a rhythmic counterpoint to the chaos of adoration around them. Every step forward seemed to intensify the crowd's fervor.\n\nAt the Plaza de Zocodover, the city's great central square, the scene became even more overwhelming. The plaza was absolutely packed—easily three thousand people crammed into a space meant for market stalls and commerce. When the procession entered, a sound rose up that was unlike anything human—a collective gasp of thousands drawing breath at once, followed by a roar that seemed to come from the earth itself.\n\nThe great noble houses had erected viewing stands along the plaza's edges. There sat the highest nobility of Castile—grandees in their finest clothing, their ladies in silk and jewels, their household knights in polished armor. But even they were standing now, straining to see, their carefully maintained dignity forgotten in the face of what they witnessed.\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza the Elder stood in his house's stand, his son Pedro beside him. The young heir had tears on his face, his hand pressed to his heart where his crusader's oath resided. The old lord simply nodded slowly, as if something he'd long suspected had been confirmed.\n\nAdmiral Fadrique Enríquez stood with his hands gripping the railing of his viewing stand, his knuckles white. His naval expertise meant nothing in this moment—he was seeing the power of faith made manifest, and it left him shaken.\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo's clergy had assembled near their stand, their ceremonial robes brilliant in the sun. They began chanting—not the planned processional hymn, but spontaneously breaking into the Te Deum. \"We praise Thee, O God, we acknowledge Thee to be the Lord...\" The Latin rose above the crowd's noise, adding structure and sanctity to the chaos.\n\nDown the Calle del Comercio, Toledo's main commercial street, the scene repeated and intensified. Merchants had closed their shops to watch. Craftsmen left their workshops. Every window, every balcony, every rooftop was packed with people. Banners hung from buildings—some showing noble heraldry, others hastily sewn white cloth in imitation of the crusade's banner.\n\nAt one corner, a group of monks from the Monastery of San Juan de los Reyes had formed a procession of their own, bearing crosses and singing hymns. When Juan's procession passed, they fell in behind, adding their voices to the growing train of followers. City guards gave up trying to stop people from joining—the crowd simply flowed around obstacles like water.\n\nA woman broke through the barriers—elderly, dressed in black widow's weeds. She fell to her knees in the street before the procession, hands raised in supplication. \"FOR MY SON!\" she screamed. \"WHO FELL AT ANTEQUERA! FINISH THE WORK! FINISH IT!\"\n\nOne of the Guardian Company crusaders broke formation slightly, reaching down as he passed to touch her outstretched hand—a moment of connection between the sacred mission and the human cost it sought to redeem. City guards gently pulled the woman back to safety, but she continued shouting blessings through her tears.\n\nThe procession climbed now, heading up toward the cathedral district where Toledo's greatest churches crowned the highest ground. The streets narrowed here, the buildings pressing closer, the crowd's noise echoing off stone walls until it became a physical vibration in the air.\n\nReligious orders lined the route in this section—Franciscans in their brown robes, Dominicans in black and white, Benedictines, Cistercians, every order represented. They knelt as the banner passed, their heads bowed in reverence for the relics it bore. Some reached out to touch the hooves of the Guardian Company's horses, seeking blessing by proximity to sacred things.\n\nAhead, the Cathedral of Toledo rose into view—the greatest church in Castile, its Gothic towers piercing the sky like prayers made stone. The plaza before it was even more packed than Zocodover had been, if that were possible. Every inch of space held humanity—nobles in their designated areas, common people filling every other gap, clergy in procession, guards struggling to maintain order.\n\nAt the cathedral steps, a small cleared area had been maintained by a double line of guards. There, barely visible through the crowd, stood a cluster of Portuguese ladies in their distinctive court dress, and among them, a small figure in white—Princess Isabel, waiting for her husband-to-be.\n\nThe procession entered the cathedral plaza and the noise somehow became even more intense. People climbed onto the statues that decorated the plaza. Young men hung from the iron railings of the cathedral's outer wall. Every vantage point held spectators. The city watch had given up maintaining order and simply worked to prevent people from being crushed.\n\nAs Juan approached the cleared space before the cathedral steps, the Guardian Company divided smoothly—twenty-five moving to each side, creating an aisle of white-tabarded crusaders. The four bearing the great banner on its frame continued forward until they reached the cathedral steps, then halted, the white silk hanging magnificently against the gothic stone.\n\nThe two bearing the reliquaries positioned themselves on either side of the banner, the gold and silver gleaming in the sun. The remaining crusaders formed up in perfect ranks, lances now held at identical angles, their discipline absolute despite the chaos around them.\n\nÁlvaro remained at Juan's side as they rode through this honor guard toward the cathedral steps. The Constable's face showed something beyond his usual political calculation—genuine awe, perhaps, or the recognition that he was witnessing history being made.\n\nThe white destrier came to a halt at the base of the cathedral steps, its hooves ringing one final time on the ancient stones. The banners attached to Juan's saddle continued to stream in the breeze, white silk flowing, catching light, seeming almost to dance.\n\nThe plaza fell into a sudden, shocked silence—thousands of people somehow managing to quiet themselves all at once, as if by common instinct they recognized that a sacred moment had arrived.\n\nIn that silence, the cathedral bells began to ring—not the usual pattern, but a cascading celebration that rolled across Toledo and beyond, carrying the news to every corner of the kingdom.\n\nKing Juan II had arrived for his wedding.\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

          "text": "The Oath Before the People\n\nJuan reached up with both gauntleted hands and grasped his bascinet. The articulated finger plates of his gauntlets moved smoothly as he lifted the helm free. The white plume caught the breeze as he brought the helmet down to tuck under his left arm, the practiced motion of a knight who'd done this a thousand times.\n\nHis face was revealed—young, serious, sweat-dampened from the heat of the enclosed helm but composed. At eighteen, he looked both impossibly young for the armor he wore and somehow exactly right for it. His dark hair was plastered to his head, his eyes bright with intensity as he looked out across the sea of faces.\n\nThe plaza held its breath.\n\nJuan's voice rang out across the cathedral plaza, trained by years of court ceremony to project clearly without shouting:\n\n\"I am Juan, King of Castile!\"\n\nThe crowd erupted briefly, then fell silent again, desperate to hear every word.\n\n\"Today, I will marry Isabel of Portugal. Today, as I make my wedding vows, I also reaffirm another vow made months ago when I met the Pope in Rome, when I promised him that one thing on the mind of every Christian Castilian from the moment we can walk. I talk of course of the Reconquista!\"\n\nThe word sent a shockwave through the plaza. Men shouted. Women wept. The sound built like thunder.\n\n\"We will march for Granada! Let the sultan tremble in fear for the sons of Christ, for we are coming for him and the vile Moors who have so violently been raiding and enslaving us Christians for so long. We will finish it, I promise you this!\"\n\nThe roar was deafening now—a sound of rage and joy and religious fervor mixed into something primal. Fists raised toward heaven. Swords were drawn and held high by knights in the crowd. The elderly widow who had broken through earlier was screaming blessings, her voice lost in the chaos but her meaning clear.\n\n\"I ask you all to pray for one another, pray for me, and if God is willing, we will succeed!\"\n\n\"WE WILL! WE WILL!\" The cry came from a thousand throats at once. \"FOR CASTILE! FOR CHRIST! FOR JUAN!\"\n\nThe Guardian Company crusaders had tears streaming down their faces beneath their helms. Some were openly weeping, their lances wavering slightly as emotion overwhelmed discipline. Fray Hernando stood among them with his hands raised in benediction, his lips moving in constant prayer.\n\nIn the noble viewing areas, the great houses were on their feet, shouting their approval. Don Íñigo López de Mendoza was bellowing support, his dignity completely abandoned. Admiral Enríquez had drawn his sword and held it high. Even the most cautious grandees—men who'd spent careers calculating political advantage—were caught up in the moment, their faces shining with something beyond mere calculation.\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo stood on the cathedral steps, his ceremonial robes brilliant in the sun, his crosier raised high. Behind him, Cardinal Capranica had emerged from the cathedral's interior, drawn by the noise. The papal legate's usually stern face showed something like wonder as he witnessed the fervor of this crowd.\n\nJuan swung down from the destrier in a smooth motion despite the plate armor—the perfectly fitted harness allowing movement that lesser work would have restricted. An attendant rushed forward to take his helmet, handling it with reverence as if it were a holy relic itself. Another attendant moved to the destrier's head, holding the reins of the great warhorse.\n\nThe white banners attached to the saddle continued to stream in the breeze, even with the horse standing still. The effect was hypnotic—white silk flowing, catching light, seeming alive.\n\nJuan walked forward through the honor guard of crusaders, his armored feet ringing on the stones. The white surcoat flowed around him with each step. The crowd's noise had become a constant roar, individual words lost in the collective voice of thousands.\n\nAt the cathedral steps, in the small cleared area protected by guards, stood Isabel.\n\nShe wore white—a wedding gown of Portuguese fashion, heavy silk with gold embroidery at the neck and sleeves, a long train held by two of her younger ladies. Her dark hair was braided and coiled, partially covered by a delicate white veil held in place by a simple golden circlet. She looked very small, very young, very Portuguese among her ladies.\n\nAnd absolutely terrified.\n\nHer face was pale, her hands clasped so tightly together that her knuckles were white. Her eyes were wide as she watched Juan approach in his armor—this figure who moments ago had addressed thousands like a warrior-prophet, who had promised war and conquest and holy victory.\n\nBut as he drew closer, something shifted in her expression. She saw beneath the armor—saw the young man she'd been getting to know over these past months, the one who prayed with her every evening, who'd been honest about his inadequacies, who'd promised to be kind.\n\nHer Portuguese ladies—Dona Beatriz prominent among them—stood in protective formation around her, their faces showing a mix of pride and anxiety. They had prepared Isabel for this moment, but nothing could truly prepare anyone for what this day had become.\n\nThe Archbishop and Cardinal Capranica descended the steps to meet Juan. The crowd's noise made speech nearly impossible, but the Archbishop raised his hands in blessing, his lips moving in Latin benediction. Capranica's face showed approval—this display of faith, this public commitment to holy war, was exactly what the papal legate had hoped to see.\n\nJuan stood now just paces from Isabel, the armored warrior-king before his bride. The cathedral bells continued their celebration. The crowd continued its roar. The Guardian Company held their positions, the blessed banner rippling above them. The white silk banners on Juan's destrier flowed in the breeze behind him like ghostly wings.\n\nIsabel's eyes met Juan's. In that moment, surrounded by thousands, they were somehow alone—two young people about to bind their lives together for purposes far larger than themselves.\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

          "text": "The Tender Moment\n\nJuan reached out with his right gauntlet, the articulated steel fingers somehow managing gentleness as he took Isabel's small hand in his. The contrast was stark—delicate pale skin against polished Milan plate, fragility against strength, Portugal against Castile.\n\nHe lifted her hand carefully, bowing his head to press his lips against her knuckles through the gap in his armor where the gauntlet met the vambrace. The gesture was courtly, proper, but also genuinely tender—a moment of human connection in the midst of overwhelming spectacle.\n\nHis lips moved close to her hand: \"It will be alright.\"\n\nWhether she heard the actual words over the crowd's roar was uncertain, but she felt them—felt the intention, the reassurance. Her terrified expression softened slightly. Her fingers, which had been rigid with tension, relaxed just a fraction in his steel grip. She nodded, barely perceptibly, and managed the ghost of a smile.\n\n\"I trust you,\" she mouthed back, though the words were lost to the noise.\n\nDona Beatriz, standing just behind Isabel, had tears streaming down her face—whether from the overwhelming spectacle or from seeing her princess find courage in this moment, it was impossible to say. The other Portuguese ladies were equally moved, their faces showing pride in their princess's composure.\n\nThe Archbishop gestured toward the cathedral's great doors, which stood open to reveal the vast interior beyond. Cardinal Capranica moved to join him, the two most senior churchmen in Castile prepared to lead the procession inside.\n\nJuan offered his armored arm to Isabel. She placed her hand delicately on his vambrace, her fingers looking impossibly small against the steel. Together, they turned toward the cathedral.\n\nThe crowd's roar somehow intensified—if such a thing were possible—as the people realized the procession was moving inside. Those who had positions in the cathedral itself began pressing forward. The city guards struggled to maintain the cleared paths.\n\nEntering the Cathedral\n\nThe Guardian Company reformed, the four bearing the great banner on its frame leading the way. They ascended the cathedral steps slowly, reverently, the white silk rippling with their movement. The two crusaders bearing the golden and silver reliquaries followed, holding the precious containers high for all to see. The remaining crusaders fell in behind, their discipline absolute.\n\nJuan and Isabel followed, climbing the steps together. With each step, the crowd's noise faded slightly as the cathedral's massive stone walls began to muffle it. The transition from brilliant morning sunlight to the cathedral's dimmer interior made everyone blink, eyes adjusting.\n\nThe Cathedral of Toledo was one of Christendom's grandest churches—a Gothic masterpiece of soaring vaults, pointed arches, and stained glass that turned sunlight into rivers of colored fire. The nave stretched impossibly long, lined with massive columns that rose like ancient trees toward the vaulted ceiling far overhead. The air smelled of incense, old stone, beeswax from thousands of candles, and the subtle mustiness of centuries.\n\nBut today, every available space was packed with humanity.\n\nThe nave was filled with Toledo's elite—great nobles, their ladies, senior clergy, representatives of religious orders, masters of the military orders, wealthy merchants who'd paid dearly for positions, foreign ambassadors, and anyone else who'd had sufficient status or connections to gain entry. Perhaps two thousand people stood in the great church, and every eye turned toward the procession as it entered.\n\nThe response was immediate. Those nearest the door began to kneel—first dozens, then hundreds, then the entire congregation like a wave rolling through the nave. The sound was extraordinary—two thousand people lowering themselves to the stone floor simultaneously, the rustle of fabric, the clink of metal, the scrape of knees on stone.\n\nThey weren't kneeling for the king. They were kneeling for what he represented—for the banner, the relics, the sacred mission he embodied.\n\nThe Guardian Company processed down the central aisle toward the high altar. The banner swayed gently with their movement, white silk glowing in the dim light. The reliquaries caught candlelight and threw it back in golden and silver flashes. Behind them, Juan and Isabel walked together—he in his white armor, she in her white gown, an image of sacred union before a single vow had been spoken.\n\nThe cathedral's choir had begun singing—not the planned processional hymn, but something spontaneous, a soaring Latin chant that seemed to come from heaven itself. The acoustics of the great church carried the sound, amplifying it, making it seem as if angels sang from the vaulted ceiling.\n\nAs they processed deeper into the cathedral, Juan became increasingly aware of the armor's weight. Standing in plate harness was manageable for short periods, but a Full High Mass with coronation would last three hours or more. His legs would tire. His back would ache. The steel would seem to grow heavier with each passing minute. Knights trained for this—the ability to remain armored and alert for extended periods—but it was never comfortable.\n\nThe high altar rose before them, a masterwork of gilded wood and precious metals, decorated with centuries of accumulated treasures. Behind it, the great reredos—the ornate carved screen that rose three stories high—was a riot of biblical scenes and saints picked out in gold and vibrant colors. Hundreds of candles burned before it, their flames dancing in some unfelt draft.\n\nTo the left of the altar, a special area had been prepared with two ornate chairs—thrones, really—where Juan and Isabel would sit during the lengthy Mass. To the right, a raised platform had been constructed, currently covered with white silk cloth. This, clearly, was where the banner and relics would be displayed for the unveiling.\n\nThe Archbishop and Cardinal Capranica ascended to the altar, turning to face the congregation. The Guardian Company divided, the banner-bearers moving to the right side platform, the reliquary-bearers beside them. The remaining crusaders formed up in the choir stalls, filling the carved wooden seats usually reserved for the cathedral's clergy. Their white tabards blazed against the dark oak.\n\nThe congregation remained kneeling, heads bowed, as Juan and Isabel reached the altar steps.\n\nCardinal Capranica raised his hands, and the choir fell silent. In the sudden quiet, the legate's voice rang clear—practiced at projecting in large spaces, trained in the rhetorical arts of Rome.\n\n\"In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.\"\n\n\"Amen.\" Two thousand voices in perfect unison.\n\n\"Beloved of Christ, we are gathered in this holy place on this most sacred of days, to witness the union of two kingdoms, two souls, and two purposes in the sight of Almighty God...\"\n\nThe Mass had begun. Juan felt Isabel's hand tighten slightly on his arm—nerves, excitement, fear, faith, all mixed together. He tried to project calm through his presence, his steadiness.\n\nThe Archbishop gestured for them to be seated in the throne-chairs. Juan moved carefully, the armor requiring deliberate movement to sit without tangling. The chair had been specially prepared—padded more than usual, the back angled to support an armored figure. Even so, sitting in plate harness meant sitting upright, back straight, no slouching. The weight settled onto his hips and spine.\n\nThree hours. Minimum.\n\nHe caught Álvaro's eye where the Constable stood among the front rank of nobles. The older man gave him an almost imperceptible nod—encouragement, solidarity, recognition of what this physical ordeal would demand.\n\nIsabel settled into her chair with considerably more grace, her ladies arranging her train around her. She glanced sideways at Juan, and despite her nervousness, there was something almost like amusement in her eyes—as if she recognized the absurdity of him sitting through a three-hour Mass in full plate armor and admired the commitment it represented.\n\nCardinal Capranica continued the liturgy, his Latin perfect, his voice carrying to every corner of the great church. The congregation responded at the appropriate moments, their voices rising and falling like waves.\n\nThe banner stood on its platform, still covered, awaiting its moment of revelation.\n\nWhat does Juan do during the Mass? (Note: I'll await your input for how he handles the long ceremony, any particular moments you want to focus on, when/how the banner unveiling happens, etc.)"

Reconquista is genuinely a centuries-long struggle that affects everyone\n3. The papal bull is legitimate and widely known\n4. The visual spectacle is genuinely unprecedented (white armor, banners, relics)\n5. Juan has been building popular support through his journey\n6. The banner was blessed by the Pope and has relics\n7. Medieval people were more openly emotional about religious matters\n8. This is Toledo - the religious heart of Castile\n9. People have been waiting/anticipating this for weeks\n10. The theatrical staging is genuinely impressive\n11. Wedding + crusade announcement is smart combination\n12. No recent disasters or famines to sour mood\n13. Portuguese alliance is seen as positive\n\n**Factors against extreme response:**\n1. Juan is only 18 and relatively untested as king\n2. The crusade hasn't actually done anything yet - just promises\n3. Medieval people could be cynical about royal spectacle\n4. Some nobles might be calculating/skeptical\n5. The common people have seen royal processions before\n6. Not everyone loves the idea of their sons going to war\n7. Taxation is coming (though not announced yet)\n8. Some might remember previous failed campaigns\n9. Álvaro de Luna is controversial - some distrust him\n10. The Infantes still have some supporters\n11. Weather, crowd discomfort, long wait times\n12. Some might be more interested in the spectacle than the mission\n\nI think the response should be:\n- Very positive overall (this IS a major event with good staging)\n- But with variation in intensity\n- Some genuine religious fervor (this is real for medieval Catholics)\n\nThe crowd's reaction reflects a nuanced mix of emotions. Some view the event through a lens of political calculation, appreciating the spectacle without deep commitment. A few skeptics lurk at the margins, questioning the king's youth and the campaign's promises. Underlying these reservations, a current of genuine religious enthusiasm runs strong, with many seeing divine purpose in the moment.\n\nYou're absolutely right to check this. Let me create a realistic d100 table for the popular response to the wedding procession and ceremony.\n\nPopular Response to the Royal Wedding Procession - d100 Table\n\nFactors to Consider:\n\nPros: Legitimate papal crusade, spectacular visual presentation (genuinely unprecedented white armor/banners), religious society, centuries of Reconquista sentiment, popular king so far, Portuguese alliance welcomed, weeks of anticipation, Toledo is religious heart of Castile\n\nCons: Juan is young and untested, crusade hasn't achieved anything yet, some remember failed campaigns, taxation implications unclear, not everyone wants their sons going to war, Álvaro de Luna is controversial, some Infantes supporters remain, medieval cynicism about royal theater\n\nThe Table:\n\n1-3: Actively Negative Response\n\nScattered boos or heckling (quickly suppressed by crowd)\n\nSome Infantes loyalists muttering about \"the boy king's vanity\"\n\nA few vocal skeptics: \"Pretty armor doesn't win wars\"\n\nConcerns about cost: \"Who pays for all this while we starve?\"\n\nWorries about sons being conscripted\n\nThe procession is seen as hollow theater by a small minority\n\n4-10: Reserved/Skeptical Response\n\nPolite applause but little enthusiasm\n\nPeople watching with arms crossed, evaluating\n\n\"Let's see if he can actually do it\" attitude\n\nAppreciation for spectacle but doubts about substance\n\nSome older nobles remember previous failed Granada campaigns\n\nCommon folk worried about what this means for taxes/levies\n\nRespect for office, skepticism about the man\n\n\"Very pretty, but the Moors have walls and soldiers\"\n\n11-25: Moderate Positive Response\n\nSolid applause, genuine appreciation of the spectacle\n\n\"Well, that's impressive\" reactions\n\nPeople enjoying the show without deep emotional investment\n\nAppreciating the craftsmanship of armor and banners\n\nPleased to see royal power displayed properly\n\nSupportive but not passionate\n\n\"Good for him, hope it works out\"\n\nMore interested in the wedding than the crusade talk\n\n26-45: Strong Positive Response\n\nEnthusiastic cheering and applause\n\nGenuine approval and support\n\nMany people moved by the combination of wedding and crusade\n\nReligious sentiment engaged but not overwhelming\n\n\"This could actually work\" optimism\n\nPride in Castilian power being displayed\n\nSome tears from those who lost family at Antequera or in raids\n\nCrusader recruitment will get genuine interest\n\nNobles impressed by the political theater\n\nCommon people feeling hopeful about the future\n\n46-65: Very Strong Response\n\nLoud sustained cheering\n\nMany people genuinely moved and emotional\n\nSignificant religious fervor visible\n\nVeterans and families of fallen openly weeping\n\n\"Saint Michael\" comparisons starting to spread\n\nYoung men already thinking about taking crusader oaths\n\nNobles standing in their viewing areas, dignity forgotten\n\nSpontaneous prayers breaking out in crowd\n\nReal sense that something historic is happening\n\nThe armor/banner combination is genuinely inspiring\n\nFaith and patriotism combining powerfully\n\n66-85: Overwhelming Positive Response\n\nDeafening roar from the crowds\n\nWidespread tears and open weeping\n\nStrong religious ecstasy in significant portions of crowd\n\nPeople falling to knees spontaneously\n\n\"Angel of God\" rhetoric spreading rapidly\n\nVeterans and widows crying out for fallen loved ones\n\nMonks and clergy joining procession spontaneously\n\nYoung men desperate to volunteer immediately\n\nEven skeptical nobles caught up in the moment\n\nSense of divine providence and sacred mission\n\nThe spectacle transcending normal royal theater\n\nGenuine mass movement beginning\n\n86-95: Near-Universal Fervor\n\nApproaching what I described in the narrative\n\nAlmost everyone deeply moved\n\nReligious ecstasy widespread\n\nMassive emotional response across all classes\n\nPeople fighting to touch the Guardian Company's horses\n\nSpontaneous hymns breaking out everywhere\n\nNobles abandoning dignity completely\n\nCommon people convinced they're witnessing a saint\n\nCrusader recruitment will be overwhelming\n\nThe moment becoming legendary even as it happens\n\nVery few unmoved observers\n\n96-100: Historical Moment of Religious Ecstasy\n\nExactly what I narrated - total overwhelming response\n\nUniversal emotional reaction\n\nReligious fervor bordering on mass hysteria\n\nEveryone from grandees to beggars moved to tears\n\nAbsolute conviction of divine mission\n\nThe procession becoming instant legend\n\nPeople will remember where they stood for rest of their lives\n\nCrusade recruitment will exceed all expectations\n\nPolitical implications enormous\n\nThis becomes THE defining moment of Juan's early reign\n\nNow you should roll to see what actually happened. Given the strong staging, legitimate religious authority, and good preparation, I'd say this is weighted toward positive (26-65 being the \"expected\" range), with real chances of very strong response (66-85) if things go well, and smaller chances of overwhelming response (86-100) or disappointing turnout (1-25).\n\nWhat do you roll?"

          "text": "Great, so the roll of 79 means an \"Overwhelming Positive Response\" - deafening roar, widespread tears, strong religious ecstasy in significant portions of the crowd, people falling to knees, \"Angel of God\" rhetoric spreading, veterans crying out, monks joining spontaneously, young men desperate to volunteer, even skeptical nobles caught up, genuine mass movement beginning. This is very strong but not quite the universal near-hysteria - there are still some observers, some skeptics, some people just enjoying the show. But it's definitely a major success.\n\nNow Juan sits through the Mass, trying to manage the discomfort of the armor, looking at Isabel, holding her hand. I need to narrate:\n1. The physical reality of sitting in armor for hours\n2. The progression of the Mass\n3. The banner unveiling at some point during the ceremony\n4. Juan and Isabel's interactions\n5. The wedding vows and coronation\n6. Keep it moving but show the passage of time\n\nThe user wants me to NOT generate Juan's dialogue or actions - just stop when he needs to respond. So I narrate the Mass, but when there are vows to be spoken, I stop and let him say them.\n\nThe Mass of Union\n\nThe overwhelming response outside had set the tone—this was no mere royal wedding, but a sacred moment that had captured the kingdom's imagination. Even inside the cathedral, the energy was palpable. The two thousand nobles, clergy, and privileged witnesses packed into the nave radiated an intensity that was unusual even for the religiously fervent society of 15th-century Castile.\n\nJuan settled into the throne-chair as best he could. The armor's weight distributed differently when sitting—pressure on the hips, the lower back, the tops of the thighs where the cuisses rested. He shifted slightly, testing which position was least uncomfortable. The padding helped, but there was no escaping the fundamental reality: he would be encased in fifty pounds of steel for at least three hours.\n\nHe focused on technique—the methods Rodrigo and the other veterans had taught him. Don't lock the muscles. Shift weight subtly every few minutes. Engage different muscle groups. Breathe deeply and regularly. Think of it as endurance training rather than torture.\n\nIsabel sat beside him, her posture perfect in the way of noblewomen trained from childhood. Her hands were folded in her lap, her face composed, but Juan could see the tension in her shoulders, the way she occasionally took a too-deep breath to calm herself.\n\nHe reached over and took her hand.\n\nShe startled slightly at the touch of the steel gauntlet, then her fingers curled around his, holding tight. She turned to look at him, and something passed between them—solidarity in facing this ordeal together, perhaps, or simply the comfort of not being alone in front of thousands.\n\nCardinal Capranica's voice rolled through the cathedral in sonorous Latin, beginning the liturgy of the Mass. The Kyrie Eleison—\"Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy.\" The congregation's responses echoed from the stone walls, creating a sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo stood beside Capranica, occasionally taking portions of the liturgy, the two prelates working in practiced harmony. Incense rose from the thurible swung by acolytes, sweet smoke curling upward toward the vaulted ceiling.\n\nJuan shifted his weight again—left hip to right hip, subtle enough that most wouldn't notice. The armor's articulation points at the waist allowed minimal movement. He engaged his core muscles, then relaxed them, then engaged again. Already, fifteen minutes in, he could feel the beginning of fatigue.\n\nIsabel's thumb moved against his gauntlet in small circles—a nervous gesture, or perhaps deliberate comfort-seeking. He squeezed her hand gently in response.\n\nThe Gloria began—\"Gloria in excelsis Deo\"—the cathedral choir joining the congregation in the great hymn of praise. The music was magnificent, voices trained for decades blending with the untrained enthusiasm of the noble congregation. The acoustics transformed it into something transcendent.\n\nTwenty-five minutes. Juan's lower back was beginning to ache. He straightened his spine, engaging different muscles, giving the fatigued ones brief respite. Breathe. Shift. Endure.\n\nThe readings began—Old Testament, Psalms, Epistle, each proclaimed from the great lectern by different clergy. Juan found himself actually listening, using the content to distract from discomfort. The selected readings emphasized faithfulness, covenant, divine blessing on righteous causes. Clearly chosen specifically for this occasion.\n\nIsabel's hand remained in his throughout. Occasionally she would glance at him, checking on him perhaps, or seeking reassurance herself. Each time their eyes met, he tried to project calm confidence, and each time she seemed to draw strength from it.\n\nForty minutes. The Gospel reading—Matthew's account of the wedding at Cana, where Christ turned water to wine. Cardinal Capranica read it himself, his voice giving dramatic weight to each verse. The symbolism was heavy-handed but effective: divine blessing on marriage, miraculous transformation, faith rewarded.\n\nJuan shifted again. Right hip to left. The breastplate's lower edge pressed against the top of his cuisses in this position. He adjusted the angle of his torso slightly. Better. For now.\n\nThe homily began. Capranica was a skilled orator, trained in Rome's rhetorical traditions. He wove together themes of marriage, crusade, divine purpose, and royal duty with practiced eloquence. He spoke of how this union joined Portugal and Castile in common cause, how Princess Isabel's faithfulness mirrored the faith required of all crusaders, how King Juan embodied both martial prowess and pious devotion.\n\nThe homily stretched to twenty minutes—long by some standards, brief by Capranica's. The legate was showing restraint, perhaps aware that even the most devout congregation had limits.\n\nAn hour and ten minutes. Juan's thighs were burning now, the muscles trembling slightly with fatigue. He locked his knees briefly to transfer some weight, then quickly unlocked them—dangerous to keep knees locked too long in armor. Could pass out. He'd seen it happen to knights at tournaments.\n\nIsabel seemed to sense his discomfort. She leaned slightly toward him, whispering so quietly only he could hear: \"You can do this.\"\n\nHe squeezed her hand in thanks.\n\nThe Creed began—the entire congregation reciting the Nicene Creed in unison. \"Credo in unum Deum, Patrem omnipotentem...\" The words washed over Juan, familiar from countless Masses, the rhythm almost meditative. He used the moment to shift again, engaging his left glutes, releasing his right, then reversing.\n\nOne hour and twenty-five minutes.\n\nThen Cardinal Capranica raised his hands for silence. The choir ceased. The congregation stilled. Every eye turned to the altar.\n\n\"Before we proceed to the sacrament of marriage,\" the legate's voice rang clear, \"we shall witness the unveiling of the sacred instruments of this holy crusade, blessed by His Holiness Pope Martin V, carried by this faithful king from Rome itself.\"\n\nA murmur rippled through the cathedral—anticipation, excitement, religious fervor barely contained.\n\nFour Guardian Company crusaders moved to the platform where the banner stood, still covered in white silk. Two more positioned themselves by the reliquaries. Fray Hernando stood nearby, his hands raised in prayer.\n\nThe moment stretched. Two thousand people holding their breath.\n\nThe crusaders grasped the covering and, with perfect synchronization, pulled it away.\n\nThe banner was revealed.\n\nPure white silk, eight feet tall, suspended from a horizontal crossbar on a pole that would make it ten feet total when carried. No devices, no heraldry, no emblems—just white fabric with subtle textures woven in that caught the candlelight and seemed to make it glow from within. Simple. Powerful. Holy.\n\nBut it was the reliquaries mounted on special brackets on either side of the banner's pole that drew gasps from the congregation. The golden reliquary containing the fragment of the True Cross gleamed like captured sunlight. The silver reliquary holding Saint James's bone shone like moonlight. Both were works of masterful craftsmanship, encrusted with gems, clearly visible even from the back of the cathedral.\n\nThe response was immediate. People fell to their knees throughout the nave—not all at once as before, but in waves as the significance hit them. Some wept openly. Others reached out as if they could touch the relics from their positions. Prayers rose up spontaneously from dozens of throats.\n\nIn the noble viewing areas, even the most jaded grandees looked moved. Don Íñigo López de Mendoza had removed his cap and bowed his head. Admiral Enríquez had a hand pressed to his heart. The Master of Santiago, Don Luis de Guzmán, stood with tears streaming into his beard.\n\nAmong the common observers in the rear sections, the reaction was even more pronounced. An elderly man collapsed, overcome. Women sobbed. Young men stared with expressions of awe and desperate desire—they wanted to serve under that banner, to touch those relics, to be part of this sacred mission.\n\nCardinal Capranica let the moment stretch, understanding the power of silence. Then, his voice thick with emotion: \"Behold the banner of Christ's holy war. Behold the relics of our salvation. Blessed by the Vicar of Christ. Carried by the righteous. Wielded against the infidel.\"\n\nHe turned to Juan and Isabel. \"And now, before these sacred witnesses, we shall join together these two souls in holy matrimony.\"\n\nOne hour and forty minutes into the Mass. Juan's entire body ached now, but the banner's unveiling had given him new energy—reminded him why he endured this, what purpose drove everything.\n\nIsabel's hand trembled in his. Whether from religious awe or nervousness about the vows to come, he couldn't tell. Perhaps both.\n\nThe Archbishop gestured for them to rise and approach the altar. Juan stood carefully—the armor made quick movements dangerous, easy to lose balance. His legs screamed in protest, muscles cramped from the long sitting. He locked them straight for just a moment to stabilize, then forced them to work properly.\n\nIsabel rose gracefully, her Portuguese ladies moving forward to arrange her train as she walked. Together, they stepped up to stand directly before the altar, Cardinal Capranica and the Archbishop flanking them.\n\nBehind them, two thousand witnesses. Above them, the vaulted ceiling soaring to heaven. Before them, the altar and beyond it the magnificent reredos with its golden saints. To their right, the banner and relics, glowing in candlelight. To their left, the Guardian Company in their white tabards, every man standing at rigid attention.\n\nCapranica opened the great marriage ritual book, its pages illuminated with gold leaf and brilliant pigments. He began the ancient liturgy, his Latin perfect, each word weighted with centuries of tradition.\n\n\"Nos convocati sumus in conspectu Dei...\" We are gathered here in the sight of God...\n\nThe ritual proceeded through its established forms. Questions about consent, about freedom from impediment, about understanding of marriage's sacred nature. Isabel answered in a clear voice, her Portuguese-accented Latin perfectly understandable. Juan's responses rang through the cathedral in the trained voice of a king accustomed to being heard.\n\nThen came the moment for the vows themselves. Capranica turned to Juan, the ritual book open before him.\n\n\"Juan, Rex Castellae, wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife, to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor and keep her, in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her, so long as ye both shall live?\"\n\nTwo thousand people waited for the answer.\n\nWhat does Juan say?"

          "text": "Juan responds with both Latin and Spanish - \"I do. Si.\" This is a nice touch showing he's speaking both formally (Latin) and in his native tongue. Now Capranica will turn to Isabel for her vows.\n\nThe Vows\n\n\"I do. Sí.\"\n\nJuan's voice carried through the cathedral—clear, firm, without hesitation. The Latin formula followed by the Spanish affirmation, making the vow comprehensible to all. No tremor, no doubt. The young king in his white armor, standing before God and kingdom, binding himself to this alliance.\n\nThe congregation seemed to release a collective breath. In the noble viewing areas, heads nodded in approval. This was the moment that sealed the Portuguese alliance, that brought Isabel's dowry and Portugal's support to the crusade cause.\n\nCardinal Capranica turned to Isabel. The young princess stood very straight, her white gown gleaming in the candlelight, her veil stirring slightly in some unfelt draft. Her face was pale but composed, her dark eyes fixed on the legate's face.\n\n\"Isabel, Princeps Lusitaniae, wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband, to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou love him, comfort him, honor and obey him, in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto him, so long as ye both shall live?\"\n\nThe question hung in the air. This was the moment Isabel left Portugal forever, left her mother and family, bound herself irrevocably to Castile and to this young king who promised her kindness but not love, who would take her into war, who carried the weight of a crusade on his shoulders.\n\nHer voice, when it came, was quieter than Juan's but equally clear: \"I do. Sim.\"\n\nThe Portuguese affirmation brought a murmur of approval—her ladies in the front rows had tears streaming down their faces. Dona Beatriz was openly weeping, proud and heartbroken at once.\n\nCardinal Capranica raised his hands in blessing. \"What God has joined together, let no man put asunder. In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.\"\n\n\"Amen.\" The cathedral's response was thunderous.\n\n\"The rings,\" Capranica commanded.\n\nAn acolyte stepped forward bearing a cushion of white silk. Upon it lay two golden rings, simple bands without elaborate decoration, blessed earlier in a private ceremony. The legate took the first, larger ring and handed it to Juan.\n\n\"Repeat after me: With this ring, I thee wed...\"\n\nJuan took Isabel's left hand—removing his gauntlet first with practiced efficiency, letting it hang from the leather strap at his wrist. Her hand was so small in his, delicate and warm. He slid the ring onto her finger, the gold seeming impossibly bright against her pale skin.\n\n\"With this ring, I thee wed. With my body I thee honor. And with all my worldly goods I thee endow. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\"\n\nIsabel's hand trembled slightly in his, but her fingers curled to accept the ring. She looked up at him, and in her eyes he saw trust—fragile, tentative, but real.\n\nThen Capranica handed Isabel the second ring. She took Juan's hand—bare now, the gauntlet hanging—and slid the band onto his finger. Her voice was steadier now, growing in confidence:\n\n\"With this ring, I thee wed. With my body I thee honor. And with all my worldly goods I thee endow. In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.\"\n\nThe rings gleamed on their fingers—married now, bound before God and witnesses.\n\nBut Capranica was not finished. He gestured, and more acolytes came forward bearing the crown of Castile—not Juan's personal crown worn for governance, but the great ceremonial crown used only for the most sacred occasions. It was a masterwork of gold and jewels, heavy with symbolism and precious metals.\n\n\"Kneel,\" the legate commanded.\n\nJuan lowered himself carefully, the armor making the movement awkward. Getting down to both knees in plate harness required balance and control—one wrong shift and he'd topple. But he managed it, kneeling on the stone steps before the altar.\n\nIsabel knelt beside him with considerably more grace, her ladies arranging her train around her.\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo stepped forward now, joining Capranica for this portion. Together, the two most powerful churchmen in Castile stood over the kneeling couple, the great crown held between them.\n\nCapranica's voice rose in the ancient coronation prayer: \"Bless, we beseech Thee, O Lord, this crown, and so sanctify Thy servant Isabel who by our humble ministry is this day to be crowned Queen...\"\n\nThe crown was placed on Isabel's head—not the full weight of a king's crown, but the lighter coronet of a queen consort, still substantial with its gold and gems. She kept her head perfectly straight, balancing the weight with the poise of someone who'd been trained for this since childhood.\n\nThe congregation erupted in applause—their new queen, crowned and consecrated.\n\nThe Archbishop raised his hands for silence, then intoned the blessing over both of them: \"May the Lord bless you and keep you. May the Lord make His face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you. May the Lord lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace, both now and in the hour of your death and in the world to come. Amen.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" the cathedral responded.\n\n\"You may rise,\" Capranica said, and Juan could hear the faint amusement in the legate's voice—he knew full well how difficult rising in armor would be.\n\nJuan managed it, using core strength and careful balance, getting one foot under him and pushing up smoothly. His legs protested, but held. He reached down to help Isabel, his bare hand taking hers, and together they rose to face the congregation.\n\nKing Juan II of Castile and Queen Isabel of Castile, crowned and wed.\n\nThe applause was deafening. Even the most dignified nobles were shouting approval. The Guardian Company crusaders were cheering, their voices raised in something between military salute and religious benediction.\n\nBut the Mass was not over. There were still the Eucharistic prayers, the consecration, communion, the final blessings. Another hour at least.\n\nCapranica gestured them back to the throne-chairs. Juan moved carefully, his bare hand still holding Isabel's, his gauntlet dangling from its strap. They sat together, now husband and wife, to witness the remaining liturgy.\n\nIsabel leaned close, whispering: \"You were perfect.\"\n\nJuan squeezed her hand, then managed to work his gauntlet back on one-handed—a skill every knight learned. The armor's weight seemed somehow more bearable now. Purpose renewed. The hardest part done.\n\nThe Mass continued. Two hours and fifteen minutes elapsed. Juan shifted, breathed, endured. Beside him, Isabel sat with the crown on her head, adjusting to its weight, her face showing concentration and growing confidence.\n\nThe consecration of the Eucharist. The prayers of the faithful. Communion distributed to the royal couple first, then to the front ranks of nobles, then working backward through the congregation. This alone took nearly thirty minutes—two thousand people receiving the host.\n\nTwo hours and fifty minutes. Juan's entire body was one long ache now, but he could see the end approaching. Final prayers. Final blessings.\n\nAt last, Cardinal Capranica raised his hands one final time: \"Ite, missa est.\"\n\n\"Deo gratias.\" Thanks be to God. The response had never been more heartfelt.\n\n\"Go forth in peace, to love and serve the Lord. And may Almighty God bless you, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\"\n\n\"Amen.\"\n\nThree hours and five minutes. The Mass was complete.\n\nThe Guardian Company moved immediately, four crusaders lifting the banner on its frame, two taking the reliquaries. They processed toward the cathedral doors, the white silk catching the light streaming in from outside.\n\nJuan stood—carefully, painfully—and offered his arm to Isabel. She rose, the crown balanced perfectly on her head now, and took his arm. Together, they followed the banner toward the doors and the plaza beyond, where thousands more waited to see them.\n\nThe procession reformed. Clergy, then the banner and relics, then Juan and Isabel, then the nobility in order of precedence. The cathedral doors stood open, brilliant sunlight streaming in, the roar of the crowd outside audible even through the thick stone walls.\n\nThey stepped through the doors onto the cathedral steps, and the noise hit like a physical force. The plaza was even more packed than before—if anything, more people had arrived during the three-hour Mass, cramming into every available space.\n\nWhen the crowd saw them—saw Juan in his white armor with Isabel crowned beside him, saw the banner and relics raised high—the roar redoubled. This was what they'd been waiting for. The king and queen. The blessed banner. The sacred cause made visible.\n\nA platform had been erected on the cathedral steps for this moment—a raised area where they could be seen by the maximum number of people. Archbishop and Cardinal ascended with them, prepared to give a final blessing visible to all.\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

          "text": "A Moment of Humanity\n\nAs they walked toward the platform, Juan leaned down close to Isabel's ear, his voice low enough that only she could hear beneath the crowd's roar:\n\n\"I am commissioning a painting of our wedding. Wearing my armor during that Mass was hell. I sure hope it was worth it. I can't wait to get out of this hot plate.\"\n\nIsabel's response was immediate—a sudden, startled laugh that she barely managed to suppress into a very unqueenly snort. Her hand flew to her mouth, her eyes dancing with surprised delight. The crown wobbled slightly on her head.\n\nShe turned to look up at him, and for a moment the terrified Portuguese princess was gone, replaced by an eighteen-year-old girl who'd just heard her husband complain about his discomfort like any normal person might. Her whisper back was equally conspiratorial:\n\n\"You looked like Saint Michael himself. But you also looked like you might faint at any moment during the Gospel reading.\"\n\n\"I nearly did during the homily,\" Juan admitted quietly, and her suppressed laugh turned into an undignified giggle that she had to forcibly control before they reached the platform.\n\nDona Beatriz, walking just behind them with the other Portuguese ladies, looked scandalized and delighted in equal measure—scandalized that her princess was giggling on the cathedral steps, delighted that she was happy.\n\nThen they ascended to the platform, and the public masks returned. Juan straightened despite his exhaustion, projecting strength and sacred authority. Isabel's expression smoothed into queenly composure, though the sparkle of amusement remained in her eyes. Together they turned to face the plaza.\n\nThe Public Blessing\n\nThe platform placed them ten feet above the cathedral plaza, visible to thousands. The crowd's noise was constant—a living thing that rose and fell but never ceased, prayer and celebration and raw enthusiasm mixed together.\n\nCardinal Capranica stepped forward to the platform's edge, his ceremonial robes brilliant in the midday sun, his crosier raised high. The Archbishop of Toledo stood beside him, arms spread wide. Behind them, the great cathedral doors framed the scene, the Guardian Company arranged with military precision holding the banner and reliquaries aloft.\n\nThe legate's voice, trained to carry across vast spaces, somehow cut through the noise:\n\n\"FAITHFUL OF CHRIST!\"\n\nThe crowd began to quiet, thousands shushing each other, desperate to hear. The silence rippled outward from the cathedral in waves until the entire plaza held its breath.\n\n\"Behold your King and Queen!\" Capranica's Latin was clear, his gestures theatrical. \"Joined this day in holy matrimony before God and witnesses! Crowned in the sight of Heaven!\"\n\nThe roar came back, but Capranica raised his hands for silence again. The crowd obeyed—barely, the noise subsiding to an eager murmur.\n\n\"Before you stand the instruments of God's holy purpose! The blessed banner!\" He gestured to where the Guardian Company held it aloft, the white silk rippling in the breeze. \"The sacred relics of our Lord's True Cross and the blessed Saint James!\" The reliquaries caught the sun and threw back golden fire. \"And the warrior-king chosen to wield them in righteous war!\"\n\nAnother roar, quickly suppressed as people strained to hear more.\n\nThe Archbishop took over, his Castilian Spanish more comfortable for the common people: \"God has blessed this union! God has blessed this crusade! God has blessed Castile with a king who will complete the work of centuries—who will drive the Moor from our sacred soil and reclaim Granada for Christ!\"\n\nThe response was thunderous. People were crying, praying, shouting. Young men in the crowd were pushing forward, clearly desperate to volunteer. Veterans of previous campaigns stood with tears streaming into grey beards. Women held up children so they could witness this moment.\n\nIn the noble viewing areas, the great houses stood in visible approval. Don Íñigo López de Mendoza was nodding slowly, his assessment clear—this theater was masterful, this staging would be remembered. His son Pedro was openly weeping, his hand over his heart where his crusader oath burned. Admiral Enríquez stood with his family, all of them moved despite their naval sophistication.\n\nCardinal Capranica raised both hands high, his voice reaching its crescendo: \"Therefore, in the name of His Holiness Pope Martin V, by the authority vested in me as Papal Legate to Castile, I proclaim to all faithful Christians: BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO TAKE UP THIS SACRED CAUSE! BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO FIGHT BENEATH THIS BANNER! BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO GIVE THEIR LIVES TO COMPLETE THE RECONQUISTA!\"\n\nHe made the sign of the cross over the entire plaza, his movements large and theatrical. \"In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti!\"\n\n\"AMEN!\" The response came from ten thousand throats at once, a sound like thunder rolling across Toledo.\n\nThe Archbishop joined Capranica, both prelates now with hands raised in benediction: \"Go forth in the knowledge that God favors this crusade! Go forth knowing that those who serve beneath this banner serve Heaven itself! Go forth and witness the glory of righteous war!\"\n\nThe crowd erupted. The noise was indescribable—not just cheering but religious ecstasy given voice. People were collapsing to their knees. Others had hands raised toward heaven. Young men were shouting their willingness to fight. Mothers were weeping, whether from joy or fear for their sons it was impossible to say.\n\nJuan stood beside Isabel, letting the moment wash over him. The armor's weight was forgotten in this instant—or rather, it became part of the message. He was suffering for this cause already, before a single battle had been fought. Visible sacrifice. Visible commitment.\n\nIsabel's hand found his, their fingers intertwining despite his gauntlet. She squeezed once, and he returned it. Whatever else this marriage was or wasn't, in this moment they were partners in something larger than themselves.\n\nThe Guardian Company began to descend the cathedral steps, moving with ceremonial precision. The four bearing the banner came first, the white silk brilliant against the stone cathedral and blue sky. The two with reliquaries followed, gold and silver gleaming. The remaining crusaders formed an honor guard, their white tabards and red crosses a powerful visual symbol.\n\nThey processed through the plaza toward the cleared area where the crusader recruitment would take place. The crowd parted before them, people reaching out to touch the crusaders' horses, to get close to the banner, to be near these sacred objects.\n\nThe fifty crusaders formed up in perfect ranks in the cleared space, the banner raised high at their center, the reliquaries positioned on either side. They stood at absolute attention, motionless as statues, a visual representation of discipline and holy purpose.\n\nFray Hernando stood beside them, his Franciscan robes somehow dignified despite their simplicity. Diego waited with his ledger, ready to record new names. Behind them, several other clergy held additional ledgers—clearly expecting significant numbers of volunteers.\n\nThe crowd pressed close to the barriers, held back by city guards. Young men were already shouting their desire to volunteer, pushing forward, desperate to be among the first to take the oath.\n\nJuan and Isabel remained on the platform with the two prelates. From here they could see the entire plaza, the crusader formation, the crowd, the city spreading beyond. Álvaro had positioned himself at the base of the platform steps, ready to coordinate whatever came next.\n\nCardinal Capranica turned to Juan, speaking quietly beneath the crowd noise: \"Your Majesty, the stage is set. When you are ready, address them. Call for volunteers. Those who wish to take the crusader oath should come forward for evaluation by Fray Hernando and the Guardian Company. Let them see that service beneath this banner is both sacred privilege and serious commitment.\"\n\nThe legate paused, something like respect in his usually bureaucratic face. \"You have created something extraordinary here, Your Majesty. Use it well.\"\n\nThe sun was high overhead now, the day warming, the plaza packed with humanity waiting for the next act in this drama.\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

          "text": "The speech hits several strong notes:\n1. Appeals to centuries of Reconquista sentiment\n2. Realistic about the difficulty and length of the campaign\n3. Gives people perspective for when morale is low\n4. Inclusive - acknowledges different ways to contribute\n5. Direct call for volunteers\n6. Promise of land rewards\n7. The sword draw with \"Non nobis domine\" is a perfect dramatic moment\n\nGiven the 79 roll and the buildup so far, this should trigger a massive response - lots of volunteers, emotional reactions, and set the stage for the recruitment drive. But I should be realistic about the numbers - medieval armies weren't that huge, and not everyone can or will volunteer despite enthusiasm.\n\nLet me write this scene properly, capturing the moment and then transitioning to the actual recruitment process and the city tour Juan planned.\n\nThe Call to Arms\n\nJuan's voice rang across the plaza, trained for command but now carrying something more—conviction, faith, the weight of history itself.\n\n\"People of Castile! Fellow Christians!\"\n\nThe crowd stilled instantly, every eye fixed on the white-armored figure on the platform.\n\n\"Today we start something that has been centuries in the making. Something that has been coming, something inevitable. All of Iberia shall be Christian and Islamic rule shall be thrown into the sea!\"\n\nThe roar came back like a wave breaking, but Juan raised his gauntleted hand and they quieted again, desperate to hear every word.\n\n\"We stand at the beginning of a long task, for it will take many years. We will all of us be tested. When we stand watch alone on a cold night. When we sit huddled at a fire in a siege that seems to go on forever. When we return home after a long season of brutal fighting and toil and glory seems so far away—think back at this moment. Think of why we are doing this and keep your eye on the prize.\"\n\nThe crowd was utterly silent now. This wasn't the usual royal rhetoric promising easy victory and quick glory. This was honesty. This was a king who understood what he was asking.\n\n\"We all contribute in our own way. Monks pray, the rich donate, some just help through their labor. And some may feel the sacred call to join the crusade itself.\"\n\nJuan gestured toward where the Guardian Company stood with the banner raised high, white silk rippling in the breeze, reliquaries gleaming.\n\n\"If you feel that call. If you feel the urge to be a part of this sacred invincible army, you can join me and my brothers in the crusade. We accept all regardless of station. Victory in Granada means rewards according to your station—lands in Granada. Join if you hear the call and I will lead you to victory.\"\n\nHis right hand moved to the hilt of his father's sword—Non Nobis Domine etched along its blade. The steel sang as he drew it, the sound cutting through the silence. He raised it high, the blade catching the sun and throwing light across the plaza.\n\n\"NON NOBIS DOMINE!\"\n\nThe response was instantaneous and overwhelming.\n\n\"NON NOBIS DOMINE!\" Ten thousand voices screaming the Latin phrase—\"Not unto us, O Lord!\" The cry of the Templars, the prayer of righteous warriors, now the battle cry of this new crusade.\n\nYoung men surged toward the barriers. The city guards struggled to hold the lines as dozens—then scores—pressed forward, shouting their desire to volunteer. Some were weeping as they pushed through the crowd. Others had expressions of almost religious ecstasy.\n\n\"I'LL FIGHT! TAKE ME!\"\n\"FOR CHRIST AND CASTILE!\"\n\"MY FATHER FELL AT ANTEQUERA—LET ME FINISH IT!\"\n\"TAKE MY OATH! TAKE MY OATH!\"\n\nVeterans in the crowd stood with tears streaming down their weathered faces, their hands pressed to their hearts. Women wept openly—some in pride, others in fear, most in both. Monks and clergy were chanting prayers, their voices rising beneath the chaos.\n\nIn the noble viewing areas, the response was equally powerful though more controlled. Young nobles were on their feet, hands on sword hilts, clearly desperate to prove themselves worthy. Don Pedro González de Mendoza had both hands gripping the railing of his family's stand, his face shining with purpose. Even older nobles looked moved—men who'd seen war and knew its cost, but who recognized this moment's significance.\n\nThe Guardian Company remained motionless, their discipline absolute, but every man's face showed emotion—pride, joy, determination. They were witnessing their brotherhood about to grow, their sacred mission gaining the warriors it needed.\n\nFray Hernando stepped forward, raising his hands for order. His voice, surprisingly powerful for a Franciscan friar, cut through the noise: \"ALL WHO WOULD TAKE THE CRUSADER'S OATH—FORM LINES! YOU WILL BE EVALUATED FOR FITNESS OF BODY AND PURITY OF PURPOSE! THIS IS NOT A TAVERN BRAWL BUT A HOLY WAR! ORDER! MAINTAIN ORDER!\"\n\nDiego and the other clerks moved forward with their ledgers, ready to begin the lengthy process of recording names, evaluating candidates, administering oaths. City guards worked to create orderly lines from the chaos of volunteers.\n\nÁlvaro appeared at the base of the platform steps, looking up at Juan with an expression of mingled awe and calculation. \"Your Majesty,\" he called up, \"the recruitment will take hours. Perhaps the tour of the city should proceed? Let the people see their king and queen, let the volunteers come to the banner in organized fashion?\"\n\nHe paused, then added more quietly: \"And perhaps Your Majesty would appreciate removing that armor in a more private setting?\"\n\nBehind Juan, Cardinal Capranica was nodding in approval at the chaos below. \"Extraordinary, Your Majesty. Absolutely extraordinary. I have seen papal processions in Rome, coronations of kings, but this...\" He shook his head. \"This is the power of genuine faith wedded to political theater. Well done.\"\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo added his own thoughts: \"The recruitment should continue throughout the afternoon. By evening, we may have hundreds of new volunteers. When they see the standards you've set with the Guardian Company, the quality of men this crusade attracts...\"\n\nIsabel stood beside Juan, still holding his hand, her crown balanced perfectly on her head now. She looked up at him with an expression that mixed admiration and concern. \"You should rest,\" she said quietly. \"You've been in that armor for four hours.\"\n\nThe plaza continued its controlled chaos below—volunteers pressing forward, the Guardian Company holding position, clergy moving among the crowd blessing those who came forward, and over it all the blessed banner rippling in the breeze.\n\nThe sun was past its zenith now, early afternoon warmth settling over Toledo. The tour of the city awaited—a chance to be seen by thousands more, to spread the word throughout the kingdom's greatest city. And then, this evening, the dinner with the nobles where the taxation would be formally announced and the machinery of war would be set fully in motion.\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

          "text": "The Royal Tour\n\nJuan raised his sword high one final time, the blade catching the sun, then sheathed it with a practiced motion. He turned to Isabel and together they waved to the plaza—she with the natural grace of Portuguese royalty, he in the slightly stiff movements of a man encased in plate armor for four hours.\n\nThe crowd's response was another roar of approval. Thousands of hands waved back, white cloths and colored scarves creating a sea of motion across the plaza.\n\nThey descended from the platform carefully. For Isabel it was merely a matter of managing her train with her ladies' help. For Juan, each step down required deliberate attention—the armor's weight combined with fatigue making balance more precarious. But he managed it without stumbling, maintaining the image of the warrior-king even as his legs trembled with exhaustion.\n\nThe white destrier waited where it had been held throughout the ceremony, still caparisoned in pure white, still bearing the tall poles with their streaming banners. A mounting block had been positioned beside it—necessary now, after four hours of standing and sitting in full plate. Juan's legs were not entirely reliable.\n\nHe placed his gauntleted hand on the saddle and pulled himself up. The movement was harder than it had been this morning—muscles fatigued, armor seeming heavier, every joint protesting. But he made it into the saddle, settling with the practiced skill of someone who'd ridden in armor many times before, even if never for this long.\n\nThe banners attached to his saddle caught the breeze immediately, streaming backward like white wings. The effect remained spectacular even though Juan could barely appreciate it through his exhaustion and discomfort.\n\nIsabel's palfrey was brought forward—a gentle grey mare with a ladies' side-saddle, caparisoned in white and gold. Her Portuguese ladies helped her mount with efficient grace, arranging her gown and train perfectly. The crown remained on her head, and she balanced it naturally now, having worn it for over an hour.\n\nÁlvaro mounted his black destrier, positioning himself at Juan's right hand once again. Behind them, the royal household guard formed up. The Guardian Company—minus the volunteers who would remain at the cathedral to process recruits throughout the afternoon—took positions around the royal couple.\n\nDon Rodrigo de Villalobos appeared with the planned route on a small parchment, consulting with the city watch captain about the streets. \"Your Majesty, we'll proceed through the commercial districts first—the Calle Mayor, past the great market, through the artisan quarters. Then to the Jewish quarter where the community has prepared an address of loyalty. Then through the northern residential districts where the lesser nobility have their houses. Perhaps two hours total, allowing for stops and addresses. The people have been waiting all day to see you.\"\n\nThe procession formed up. The banner-bearers took the lead, the white silk brilliant in the afternoon sun. Then Juan and Isabel, side by side, king and queen. Then the nobility in order of precedence—Don Íñigo López de Mendoza and his son Pedro prominent among them, Admiral Enríquez and his family, the Masters of the Military Orders who had attended, representatives of every great house.\n\nThe city gates leading out of the cathedral district stood open. Beyond them, the streets of Toledo waited—packed with humanity that had been there since dawn, that had heard the Mass echoing from the cathedral, that had seen the banner raised and heard the king's call to crusade.\n\nThe procession moved forward at a ceremonial walk. As they passed through the gates, the noise began again—that overwhelming wall of sound that was part celebration, part prayer, part something beyond words.\n\nThrough the Streets of Toledo\n\nThe route took them down from the cathedral heights into the heart of Toledo's commercial district. The Calle Mayor—the city's main street—had been decorated with banners and garlands. Every balcony was packed with people. Every window held faces. The street itself was lined ten deep on both sides despite the barriers.\n\nAs Juan rode past in his white armor with banners streaming, the response was immediate and intense. People fell to their knees. Others reached out as if they could touch him from distance. Children on shoulders pointed and shouted. Women threw flowers—white roses, carnations, lilies—creating a carpet of petals on the cobblestones.\n\n\"LONG LIVE THE KING!\"\n\"QUEEN ISABEL! BLESSED BE!\"\n\"SAINT MICHAEL RIDES AMONG US!\"\n\"FOR THE CRUSADE! FOR CHRIST!\"\n\nThe shouts came from every direction, overlapping into a cacophony of devotion. Juan waved, turning in his saddle to acknowledge different sections of the crowd despite the armor's constraints and his body's fatigue. Beside him, Isabel waved with both hands, her face showing wonder at the reception.\n\nThrough the great market square—normally packed with stalls and merchants but cleared today for the procession. The guild masters stood in organized groups, their ceremonial robes marking their crafts. The butchers' guild, the cloth merchants, the metalworkers, the bakers—each group bowing as the procession passed.\n\nThe master of the metalworkers' guild stepped forward, holding up a small chest. \"Your Majesty! Our guild donates fifty florins to the crusade and pledges our craft to equip your warriors!\"\n\nOthers followed—the cloth merchants pledging banners and tabards, the leatherworkers offering to make saddles and harness at cost, the armorer's guild promising priority service. Each pledge was recorded by clerks riding among the procession, but the offers came faster than they could write.\n\nInto the artisan quarters where the workshops lined narrow streets. The smiths had arranged an honor guard of their apprentices, all holding hammers high in salute. The sound of metal on metal rang out as the procession passed—a rhythmic clanging that was both martial and celebratory.\n\nAn elderly carpenter stood at his workshop door, tears streaming down his face. \"My grandson!\" he shouted. \"He's at the cathedral now, taking the oath! Bless him, Your Majesty! Bless him!\"\n\nJuan raised his hand in acknowledgment, and the old man collapsed to his knees, openly weeping.\n\nThe Jewish quarter lay in the eastern section of the city, its streets narrower, its buildings packed closer. The community had prepared for this moment—the rabbi and community leaders stood in ceremonial dress at the quarter's main plaza, a presentation prepared.\n\nThe rabbi stepped forward, his Hebrew accented Spanish careful and formal: \"Your Majesty, Queen Isabel, the Jewish community of Toledo pledges its loyalty and support. We offer ten thousand maravedís to the crusade treasury and our prayers for your success.\"\n\nIt was a carefully calculated pledge—enough to show loyalty without being so large as to attract resentment or accusations of excessive wealth. The rabbi knew the delicate position his people occupied.\n\nJuan acknowledged the gift with a nod, and the Jewish community bowed deeply as the procession continued. In the narrow streets, faces watched from windows—cautious, hopeful, aware that crusading fervor could sometimes turn against non-Christians even within Christian kingdoms.\n\nThrough the northern residential districts where lesser nobility and wealthy merchants had their houses. These families stood at their doorways in their finest clothing, their household servants arranged behind them. Each bowed as the procession passed, and many pledged support—men for the levies, money for the treasury, supplies for the armies.\n\nA widow in black stepped into the street, held back from approaching closer by guards but near enough to be heard. \"Your Majesty! My husband fell at Antequera! My son is at the cathedral taking the oath! Finish the work! Finish it so no more widows weep!\"\n\nHer voice cracked on the last words, and Isabel's face showed emotion—genuine sympathy for this woman's loss. She reached into a small purse at her belt and gestured to a guard, who took coins to the widow. A small gesture, but noted by the crowd nearby.\n\nThe sun was lowering now, mid-afternoon sliding toward evening. The tour had taken nearly two hours of constant riding, constant waving, constant public presence. Juan's entire body was screaming for relief. The armor that had seemed merely uncomfortable during the Mass was now approaching torture. Sweat soaked the padding beneath the steel. His shoulders burned. His thighs cramped. His back felt like it might break.\n\nBut he maintained the image—upright, strong, waving to the crowds. The angel of war could not show weakness.\n\nIsabel rode beside him, and occasionally their eyes would meet. She could see his exhaustion, could see him struggling, but she said nothing—simply being present, her solidarity a form of support.\n\nAt last, the procession turned back toward the Alcázar. The palace came into view, its walls rising above the city, its gates standing open. The plaza before it was packed, but the guards had maintained a clear path.\n\nOne final surge of cheering as the people recognized the procession was returning. One final wave of religious fervor and patriotic enthusiasm. Then they were passing through the gates into the relative quiet of the palace courtyard.\n\nThe Relief of Disarming\n\nThe moment the gates closed behind them, cutting off the crowd's noise to a distant murmur, Juan felt his entire body sag slightly in the saddle. The public performance was over. Privacy at last.\n\nServants rushed forward. Master Gonzalo appeared from somewhere, his apprentices with him—they had remained at the palace, ready for this moment.\n\nJuan practically fell from the saddle, his legs barely holding him as he dismounted. Two grooms steadied him, and he had to stand still for a moment, simply keeping his balance as the blood returned to cramped muscles.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Master Gonzalo said urgently, \"let us get you out of this. Quickly now, before you collapse.\"\n\nThey moved to the great hall where he'd armed that morning—it felt like a lifetime ago. Isabel followed with her ladies, then tactfully dismissed them to give Juan privacy for the disarming. Only she remained, watching with concern as the process began.\n\nThe gauntlets came off first—Juan pulled them free himself, desperate to feel air on his hands. Then the helpers began working on straps and buckles. The arm harness came apart piece by piece. The breastplate was lifted away, and Juan took the first full breath he'd had in over four hours, his chest expanding without restriction.\n\n\"Madre de Dios,\" he breathed, and despite the blasphemy Isabel didn't correct him—she understood.\n\nThe back plate, the gorget, the leg harness—each piece removed revealed padding soaked through with sweat. Juan's under-clothing was drenched, his hair plastered to his head. When the last piece came off and he stood in just the soaked arming doublet, he looked like he'd been swimming.\n\nHe sat heavily in a chair, not caring about dignity, and one of Master Gonzalo's apprentices knelt to remove his boots and the padded shoes beneath. His feet were swollen, red, marked with pressure points from the armor's weight transmitted through the leg harness.\n\n\"Water,\" Juan managed. \"For the love of God, water.\"\n\nA servant rushed forward with a pitcher and cup. Juan drank deeply, the lukewarm water the finest thing he'd ever tasted.\n\nIsabel approached, her crown still balanced on her head—she'd worn it so long now she'd forgotten about it. She knelt beside his chair, propriety forgotten, and took his hand. \"You did it. You were magnificent.\"\n\nJuan looked at her through eyes heavy with exhaustion. \"I thought I was going to die during the consecration. My vision actually went dark for a moment.\"\n\n\"But you didn't fall. You didn't show weakness. Every person in that cathedral, every person in those streets—they saw a king who would endure anything for this cause. They saw...\" she paused, choosing words carefully, \"they saw someone worth following.\"\n\nÁlvaro entered then, having supervised the noble escort's dispersal. He took one look at Juan and laughed—actual laughter, rare from the usually controlled Constable. \"Your Majesty, you look like you've already fought the entire campaign. But by God, it was worth it. The city is yours. Those volunteers...\" He shook his head. \"Diego sent word—over three hundred men have taken the oath already and they're still coming. Three hundred in four hours, and the sun hasn't even set.\"\n\nHe paused, his expression becoming more serious. \"The dinner is in two hours. The nobles are gathering, expecting the taxation announcement. Can you...\" He gestured at Juan's current state.\n\nJuan closed his eyes briefly, summoning reserves he wasn't sure he had. \"Yes. Two hours. I'll be ready.\"\n\nMaster Gonzalo bowed deeply. \"Your Majesty, that armor performed flawlessly. Not a single joint failure, not one strap broken despite the stress. It did exactly what I designed it to do. But please...\" he added with genuine concern, \"never wear it for four hours straight again unless you're actively in battle. The human body has limits even in perfect armor.\"\n\n\"Noted,\" Juan said weakly.\n\nIsabel stood, touching his shoulder gently. \"I'll go prepare for the dinner. Rest, Juan. Even if just for an hour. You've earned it.\"\n\nShe left with her ladies, the crown finally removed from her head by Dona Beatriz—she'd worn it for over three hours herself without complaint.\n\nThe great hall emptied until only a few servants remained. Juan sat in the chair, his body slowly recovering, drinking water, letting the sweat cool on his skin.\n\nThrough the window, he could hear Toledo still celebrating. Distant cheers, church bells ringing, the sounds of a city transformed by what they'd witnessed.\n\nIn two hours, he would face the nobility and announce the taxation that would fund this war. He would set in motion the machinery that would assess every great house, that would extract wealth from reluctant nobles, that would turn religious fervor into military might.\n\nBut for now, for this brief moment, he simply sat and breathed and felt grateful to be out of the armor.\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

          "text": "Recovery and Preparation\n\nServants brought fresh clothing—a fine doublet in deep blue velvet, hose, a white linen shirt, and soft leather boots that felt like nothing after the steel sabatons. The contrast was extraordinary. After four hours bearing fifty pounds of plate armor, the normal court dress felt like wearing air itself. Juan could move freely, breathe deeply, feel the fabric against his skin instead of padded layers and steel.\n\nThe hour of rest passed quietly. Isabel had changed into a formal Portuguese gown suitable for the evening's dinner—deep crimson with gold embroidery, her hair freshly arranged, a smaller and lighter crown than the coronation piece. She looked exhausted but composed, the nervousness from the morning replaced by a kind of weary satisfaction.\n\nThey sat together in the small receiving room adjacent to the royal chambers, neither speaking much. Sometimes silence was its own form of companionship. Through the windows, Toledo's celebrations continued—distant music, shouting, the sounds of a city transformed by the day's events.\n\nA servant appeared at the appointed time. \"Your Majesties, the nobles are gathering in the great hall. Don Álvaro has arranged the seating according to precedence. Cardinal Capranica and the Archbishop will be present as well.\"\n\nThe Dinner Gathering\n\nThe great hall had been transformed for the occasion. Long tables arranged in a U-shape, the high table at the center where Juan and Isabel would sit with the most important guests. Candles everywhere—hundreds of them, turning the stone hall golden with flickering light. Tapestries hung from the walls depicting previous royal victories. Servants moved efficiently, carrying wine pitchers and platters.\n\nThe nobility of Castile filled the hall—perhaps two hundred of the kingdom's most important figures. Every great house was represented: the Mendozas, the Enríquezes, the Guzmáns, the Manriques, the Stuñigas. Masters of the Military Orders in their distinctive habits. Senior clergy in their formal robes. Wealthy merchants who'd earned positions through donations. Foreign ambassadors watching with keen interest.\n\nThe room fell silent as Juan and Isabel entered. Every person stood, bowing or curtseying according to rank and custom. The scrape of chairs and benches, the rustle of fine fabric, then stillness.\n\nÁlvaro stood near the high table, clearly having orchestrated the entire arrangement. Cardinal Capranica occupied a position of honor to the right of where Juan would sit, the Archbishop of Toledo to the left. Don Íñigo López de Mendoza and his son Pedro had prominent positions. Admiral Enríquez sat with his family nearby.\n\nThe faces showed a mix of emotions—genuine celebration of the wedding, religious enthusiasm from the day's events, but also calculation and some anxiety. Everyone in this room knew that something significant would be announced tonight. The rumors about taxation had been circulating for weeks. Now they would learn the reality.\n\nAs Juan and Isabel took their seats at the high table, servants began bringing the first course—a formal dinner that would last hours, with many courses, much wine, and eventually the business that everyone was waiting to hear.\n\nThe hall remained standing until Juan was seated, then sat in a coordinated motion, the rustle of fabric and scrape of wood filling the space.\n\nÁlvaro raised his cup. \"My lords, ladies, honored guests—to Their Majesties King Juan and Queen Isabel, joined this day in holy matrimony and sacred purpose!\"\n\n\"TO THEIR MAJESTIES!\" Two hundred voices in unison, cups raised, wine drunk.\n\nThe dinner began. Servants moved efficiently between tables. Conversations started—quiet at first, then growing in volume as wine flowed and initial formality eased. Music played from a corner where musicians had been positioned—lutes, viols, creating pleasant background sound.\n\nThe first courses came and went—soups, fish prepared in elaborate sauces, roasted birds, vegetables in spiced broths. The food was exceptional, as befitted a royal wedding feast, but Juan could feel the tension underlying the celebration. People were waiting.\n\nBetween courses, nobles approached the high table to offer personal congratulations. Don Íñigo López de Mendoza came with his son, bowing formally. \"Your Majesty, a magnificent day. My house is honored to serve in the crusade. Young Pedro here can speak of nothing else since taking his oath.\"\n\nPedro's face was still shining with the fervor from the cathedral. \"Your Majesty, I will not disappoint you. My grandfather's sacrifice will be avenged.\"\n\nAdmiral Enríquez approached with his assessment of the naval preparations, speaking quietly about ship contracts and supply routes, using the social occasion for practical coordination.\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán, Master of Santiago, bent his knee before Isabel specifically. \"Your Majesty, the Order of Santiago pledges its protection to you during the campaign. You will travel safer than in your mother's palace.\"\n\nThe courses continued. More wine. More conversation. The tension slowly building as the meal progressed and everyone wondered when the real announcement would come.\n\nFinally, as the main courses were being cleared and before the desserts arrived, Álvaro stood. The hall quieted immediately—everyone recognizing that the moment had arrived.\n\nThe Constable's voice carried across the hall: \"My lords, His Majesty has an announcement regarding the practical prosecution of the holy crusade we celebrate this day.\"\n\nEvery eye turned to the high table. Some faces showed resignation, others curiosity, a few poorly concealed anxiety. Cardinal Capranica sat with his hands folded, his expression neutral but attentive. The Archbishop looked supportive. The foreign ambassadors leaned forward, interested in how Castile would fund this war.\n\nThe hall waited.\n\nWhat does Juan do?"

We have all taken vows and oaths, and now is a moment where I announce the practical aspects of the crusade and the taxation the papal bull mentioned should be levied to finance the campain.\n\n\nThere will be a 5% tax on revenue on all noble estates and 10% on all chruch revenues. I have worked together with the vatican and it's legate to ensure these taxes are fair and just. To ensure correct estimates of actual revenue, we will assess the revenues. It will be performed by both crown and vatican assessors. They will visit your estates and I expect everyone's cooperation so no one will have the feeling to pay more than his neighbour.\n\n\nThere is however an exemption I want to introduce to this tax in order to keep it just and to make sure smaller estates are not unjustly squeezed. Every noble who serves in the crusade personally will be excempt from paying 2000 maravedis for that year. This ensures these taxes are both fair and just, something I think is very important.\n\n\nAnd finally, I will make full use of the power vested in me by the bull to grant me full command and the ability to raise noble levies for the coming campain. These will be supported by their noble lords, but the crown will provide supplies like food ect. I require you to fight as per our ancient noble contract. Be ready to be called upon for I will do so in the coming year.\n\n\nBut now lets talk of rewards. When we take Grenada, the lands will of course be divided under those who have fought the most and the hardest first. I will first give lands to the vowed crusaders, then to the nobles of the reals according to their contribution. When we have secured these lands, we not only free ourselves from raids on lands, but we also secire the sea routes. We can finally start to secure our ports and start building our trade fleets in the image of Portugal. Even more riches await us.\n\n\nA toast to a successful crusade and future glories!\n\n\nI raise my glass and toast."

          "text": "The Taxation Announcement\n\nJuan stood, and the hall fell into absolute silence. Every noble, every cleric, every merchant held their breath. This was the moment that would determine how deeply this crusade would reach into their purses.\n\nHis voice carried clearly across the great hall, measured and authoritative. He laid out the terms methodically—the 5% on noble estates, the 10% on church revenues, the assessment teams, the cooperation expected. Then the exemption for personal service, and finally the promise of Granada's lands for those who fought.\n\nWhen he raised his glass in toast, there was a moment—just a heartbeat—of hesitation.\n\nThen Cardinal Capranica rose, his cup raised high. \"TO THE CRUSADE!\"\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo followed immediately. \"TO VICTORY IN GRANADA!\"\n\nThe hall erupted. Two hundred nobles and clergy rose as one, cups raised, the response thunderous: \"TO THE CRUSADE! TO VICTORY! TO CASTILE!\"\n\nBut the response was more complex than simple enthusiasm. Juan could see it in the faces, in the body language, in the speed or reluctance with which different nobles rose.\n\nThe Committed Houses:\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza was on his feet instantly, his cup high, his voice booming approval. His son Pedro beside him was practically glowing—having taken the crusader oath that morning, his house would benefit from both the exemption and future land grants. \"WELL SPOKEN, YOUR MAJESTY! FAIR AND JUST!\"\n\nAdmiral Enríquez stood with military precision, his naval expertise already pledged. The exemption meant little to him—he'd serve regardless—but the promise of secured sea routes and trade had his attention. His expression showed calculation mixed with approval.\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán, Master of Santiago, raised his cup with genuine enthusiasm. The Military Orders paid the church tax anyway, but the promise of lands in Granada was attractive, and his Order was fully committed. \"THE SANTIAGO RIDES WITH YOU, YOUR MAJESTY!\"\n\nThe Calculating Nobility:\n\nMany of the great houses rose and toasted but with visible reservation. They understood the mathematics—5% of their revenues was substantial, even with the 2,000 maravedí exemption for personal service. The assessment teams meant they couldn't simply lie about their wealth.\n\nBut they also understood the political reality. The overwhelming response to the wedding procession, the religious fervor in the streets, the papal backing—this crusade had momentum that made opposition dangerous. Better to comply and seek advantage than resist and be labeled unpatriotic or impious.\n\nA middle-aged lord from the Stúñiga family stood with his cup raised, his face showing careful neutrality. \"To the crusade,\" he said, loud enough to be heard but without enthusiasm.\n\nThe Manrique clan—Rodrigo's relatives—rose in solid support, their family honor tied to their kinsman's command of the western army. But their faces showed the calculation: how much would this cost versus how much could they gain?\n\nThe Reluctant Compliance:\n\nSome houses rose more slowly. Faces showing poorly concealed dismay at the taxation announcement, but the social pressure too great to remain seated. A few older lords who remembered previous failed campaigns looked skeptical about the promises of land and riches.\n\nOne elderly grandee—Don García de Ayala, known for his wealth and his parsimony—stood with his cup raised but his lips pressed thin. He would pay because he had to, but he clearly wasn't happy about it.\n\nSeveral lesser nobles were doing rapid mental calculations, trying to figure out whether the 2,000 maravedí exemption was worth personally serving in a dangerous military campaign. Some would conclude yes, eager for adventure or land. Others would pay the tax and stay home.\n\nThe Church Response:\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo's enthusiastic support was genuine—he understood that 10% church taxation was the papal bull's explicit authorization and couldn't be contested. Better to embrace it enthusiastically than appear to resist Rome's will.\n\nOther clergy in attendance showed more mixed reactions. Some monasteries and religious houses were wealthy; 10% would hurt. But Cardinal Capranica's presence made resistance impossible. They rose and toasted with varying degrees of conviction.\n\nThe Foreign Observers:\n\nThe Portuguese ambassador stood with obvious satisfaction—his princess was now queen, the alliance sealed, and Portugal stood to benefit from Castile's crusade without bearing its costs. He toasted enthusiastically.\n\nThe Aragonese observer was more reserved, calculating what this meant for the balance of power in Iberia. A successful Castilian conquest of Granada would make Juan's kingdom dominant. But he toasted politely, aware that openly showing concern would be impolitic.\n\nThe Aftermath of the Toast\n\nAs everyone drank and sat back down, the hall erupted into conversation. The formal announcement was done; now came the private processing, the calculations, the political maneuvering.\n\nÁlvaro remained standing, his voice cutting through the growing noise: \"Assessment teams will begin deployment in the spring. All noble houses will receive formal notice before assessors arrive. The oversight committee—His Majesty, Cardinal Capranica, and the Archbishop—will review all assessments for fairness. Appeals may be made to the committee directly.\"\n\nThis addition seemed to ease some tensions. The promise of oversight and appeals suggested the process wouldn't be arbitrary, that there would be recourse against unfair assessment.\n\nDon Íñigo López de Mendoza rose again, his voice carrying: \"Your Majesty, the House of Mendoza pledges full cooperation with the assessment and reaffirms our commitment of eighteen hundred men to the crusade!\" It was a public declaration of support designed to set an example for other houses.\n\nOthers followed, competing to show loyalty:\n\n\"The Enríquez family pledges cooperation and naval expertise!\"\n\n\"House Manrique stands ready to serve!\"\n\n\"The Guzmán clan offers full support!\"\n\nEach declaration built momentum, creating social pressure on those who might otherwise resist. To remain silent now would mark a house as potentially disloyal or impious.\n\nCardinal Capranica stood, raising his hands for attention. \"His Majesty has demonstrated both the authority granted by His Holiness and the wisdom to use it justly. The exemption for personal service shows understanding of noble sacrifice. The joint assessment ensures fairness. The promise of Granada's lands rewards the faithful. This is how a Christian king prosecutes holy war.\"\n\nThe papal legate's endorsement carried enormous weight. Any house considering resistance now faced not just the king but Rome itself.\n\nThe dessert courses began arriving—elaborate confections, fruits preserved in honey, sweetened wines. The formal business was concluded; the remainder of the evening would be celebration and private conversations.\n\nNobles began moving between tables, forming small groups to discuss implications. Some approached the high table to speak with Juan directly, others clustered around Álvaro or Cardinal Capranica seeking clarification on specific points.\n\nDon García de Ayala, the elderly grandee who'd looked so unhappy, approached the high table. He bowed stiffly. \"Your Majesty, the House of Ayala will of course comply with the assessment. However, I must note that my estates have suffered from poor harvests these past two years. I trust the assessors will take such factors into account when calculating revenue?\"\n\nIt was phrased as a request but carried an edge—a warning that he would fight any assessment he deemed unfair.\n\nNear the lower tables, younger nobles were clustered in excited conversation—clearly discussing whether to take crusader oaths themselves to gain the exemption and the promise of land. The 2,000 maravedí exemption had created exactly the incentive Juan intended: encouraging personal service while maintaining revenue.\n\nA group of clergy gathered around the Archbishop, their conversation too quiet to overhear but their expressions showing concern. Ten percent of church revenues was substantial, and many religious houses operated on tight margins already.\n\nIsabel sat beside Juan, observing it all with intelligent eyes. She leaned close, her voice quiet: \"You've given them no room to refuse without looking like they oppose the crusade itself. Clever. But some of them...\" she gestured subtly toward Don García and a few others, \"will make the assessments difficult.\"\n\nThe evening continued. More wine flowed. Musicians played. Nobles moved between tables in complex social dances of alliance and rivalry. Through it all, the underlying calculation: how much would this cost, how much could be gained, and was resistance possible or even wise?\n\nBy the time the final courses were cleared and nobles began taking their leave—bowing to the king and queen, offering final congratulations on the marriage—the consensus seemed clear: the taxation would proceed. Some enthusiastically, some grudgingly, but it would proceed.\n\nÁlvaro approached the high table as the crowd thinned. \"Your Majesty, that went as well as could be hoped. A few will resist the assessments, try to hide wealth or claim poverty, but the oversight structure will handle it. The exemption for personal service was brilliant—it's already working. I've had six nobles approach me tonight about taking crusader oaths specifically to reduce their tax burden.\"\n\nHe paused, a slight smile. \"Of course, once they take the oath and serve in the campaign, whether they saved two thousand maravedís becomes rather academic. They'll be crusaders regardless of their original motivation.\"\n\nCardinal Capranica joined them, his usually stern face showing something like approval. \"Well executed, Your Majesty. The assessment program will be rigorous but fair. Those who cooperate will find the process reasonable. Those who resist...\" he shrugged, \"will learn that Rome's patience has limits.\"\n\nThe great hall was nearly empty now, servants beginning to clear the remains of the feast. The wedding day—begun before dawn with the armoring, continuing through the overwhelming procession, the three-hour Mass, the tour of Toledo, and now this formal dinner—was finally ending.\n\nIsabel looked exhausted but satisfied. The crown was gone from her head, handed off to attendants hours ago. Her crimson gown was slightly rumpled. But she held herself with dignity, every inch a queen despite being only eighteen and in a foreign kingdom.\n\nThe day had achieved everything intended: the marriage sealed, the alliance formalized, the crusade proclaimed, the taxation announced, the nobles committed or at least compliant. Tomorrow the real work would begin—assessment teams deployed, levies mustered, supplies procured, armies assembled.\n\nBut tonight, the foundation was laid.\n\nWhat does Juan do?"
