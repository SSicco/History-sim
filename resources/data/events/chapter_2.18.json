Current expedition status:\n- 591 knights fit for duty\n- 34 recovering in Barcelona (following on merchant vessels)\n- 10 ships operational\n- Royal family present: Queen Lucia (pregnant with second child), Princess Catalina (age 2), three ladies-in-waiting\n- Prince Fernando remained in Toledo with Doña Beatriz\n\nJuan's agenda for the papal audience:\n1. Constantinople aid - request papal support, funds, calls for other kingdoms\n2. Parallel legislation - ask Pope to co-sign/adopt Basel reforms\n3. Navigate Basel per Como letters - support papal authority while acknowledging legitimate reform\n4. Granada University charter - papal approval for natural philosophy/sciences focus (not theology)\n5. Crusade termination criteria - clarify when expedition ends\n6. Carries Emperor Sigismund's letter alongside his own\n\nLet me set the scene for Chapter 2.18.\n\nNow I have the full context. Let me set the scene for Chapter 2.18.\n\nCHAPTER 2.18\n\nRome: Preparations and Audiences\n\nMarch 22-23, 1434\n\nThe summons arrived by the hand of a young papal secretary in black cassock—parchment bearing the seal of the Fisherman's Ring, requesting His Most Catholic Majesty Juan II of Castile present himself at the Apostolic Palace on the morrow, the twenty-third day of March, at the hour of Terce.\n\nThree days you have waited in the Palazzo di San Marco, watching Rome from its upper galleries. The city sprawls before you, eternal and fractured—the dome of the old Pantheon visible beyond a tangle of medieval towers, the Tiber brown with spring runoff curving through neighborhoods that once housed emperors and now shelter weavers and butchers. Somewhere beyond the rooftops, the half-finished hulk of St. Peter's awaits, and the man who claims to speak for God on earth.\n\nYour household has found its rhythm in the palazzo. Queen Lucia rests often—the pregnancy progresses well, but sea voyages are no friend to women with child, and the first trimester's sickness has not entirely passed. Catalina, now two years old and possessed of boundless energy, has made a conquest of the palazzo's courtyard, where she commands a battalion of imaginary soldiers from atop an overturned wine cask while Doña Leonor watches with the patient exhaustion of all who attend small children.\n\nThe 591 knights of your expedition are encamped at San Paolo fuori le Mura, the great basilica outside the walls where the Apostle Paul lies buried. Captain Fernán has reported daily: morale is recovering from the Mistral disaster that cost you 75 souls, but the men are restless. They came to fight Turks, not to wait in monastery gardens.\n\nThe morning is yours before the audience.\n\nWhat do you wish to accomplish?"

The oarsmen work in steady rhythm, their calls echoing across the water as Rome rises slowly from the flatlands ahead.\n\nYour fleet anchored at Ostia this morning after three days from Cagliari—a mercy, given the Mistral disaster of March 7th that cost you 75 souls and scattered your formation across half the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Princesa Catalina weathered the storm, though barely. Now ten ships rest in the harbor while river barges ferry your household upriver to the city.\n\nLucia sits beside you on cushions arranged against the barge's low gunwale, her hand resting on her belly where your child with Lucia grows. The pregnancy is perhaps three months along now—early enough that travel remains possible, late enough that the sickness has begun to ease. She watches the approaching city with the quiet attention of someone returning to familiar territory after long absence.\n\nCatalina—two years old, imperious, and entirely unimpressed by ancient capitals—has claimed the bow of the barge as her personal domain, where Doña Leonor prevents her from leaning too far over the water while the child points at every passing bird and demands to know its name.\n\nThe first domes and towers of Rome appear through the river haze. You can make out the bulk of Castel Sant'Angelo, the old mausoleum of Hadrian converted to papal fortress, its round mass dominating the river approach. Beyond it, the jumble of medieval construction rises—churches, towers, the crumbling shells of ancient temples repurposed as markets and stables.\n\nCaptain Fernán stands near the stern, conferring quietly with the barge master about landing arrangements. The 591 knights who survived the storm will march overland from Ostia tomorrow, but tonight the household must be settled.\n\nThe barge rounds a bend, and Rome spreads before you in full."

Key updates: Session 15 passed the Decree on Clerical Concubinage (Sept 14, 1433); Session 16 passed the Decree on Pluralism closing the dispensation loophole by transferring authority from Rome to local ordinaries (Sept 28, 1433); Session 17 passed Annates Reform reducing papal taxation by 75% while preserving a revenue stream (Oct 19, 1433); the Compacts of Basel ended the Hussite Wars (Nov 30, 1433); Session 19 passed the Crusade Decree for Constantinople with near-unanimous support but only Castile and the Knights of St. John committed forces (Dec 14, 1433). Hernando explains concomitance doctrine, the Council's voting structure through four deputations, the French faction's strength (~60-80 committed supporters under Cardinal d'Allemand), and why the constitutional question of Haec Sancta prevents the Council from concluding. They discuss strategies to end the Council, including parallel legislation where the Pope adopts Basel's reforms under his own authority. Hernando explains the annates split between the Apostolic Camera and metropolitan archbishops as a significant decentralization of church finances.",

          "text": "The river bends again, and you let your mind turn to the leather satchel that sits beside Captain Fernán at the stern—the accumulated correspondence of months, couriers finding you at Cagliari, at Barcelona, at every port and relay station where your fleet paused.\n\nThe Castilian delegation has written faithfully, as you instructed. Abbott Rodrigo's letters arrive in his cramped, scholarly hand; Bishop Alfonso's in the elegant script of a trained diplomat. Since September, Fray Hernando has been with you rather than at Basel, but the others have maintained the flow of intelligence.\n\nWhat you know from your delegation's reports:\n\nThe Autumn of Reform (September-October 1433)\n\nThe Declaration of Como had the effect you hoped. When Emperor Sigismund arrived at Basel in late June with your joint declaration in hand, the moderate faction found their spine. The French extremists under Cardinal d'Allemand continued to push for papal deposition, but the German pragmatists and your Castilian delegation formed a working coalition.\n\nThree major reform decrees passed in rapid succession:\n\nSession 15 (September 14, 1433): Clerical Concubinage — A graduated penalty system for priests keeping women. Warning for first offense, suspension for second, deprivation for third. Your delegation reports that Bishop Alfonso spoke powerfully in favor, citing Granada's newly-conquered churches as places where reform must begin fresh rather than inherit old corruptions.\n\nSession 16 (September 28, 1433): Pluralism — No cleric may hold multiple benefices with cure of souls. Cardinals limited to one bishopric. The critical innovation: dispensations now granted by local ordinaries, not Rome, and only for three narrow causes. This closes the loophole that destroyed every previous anti-pluralism decree. Abbott Rodrigo writes with evident satisfaction that the decree follows the Como principle exactly—grandfather existing lawful arrangements, reform going forward.\n\nSession 17 (October 19, 1433): Annates Reform — Papal taxation of benefices reduced by seventy-five percent, but not abolished entirely. Abbott Rodrigo emphasizes this distinction in three separate letters. The historical Council of Basel, he warns, made the catastrophic error of eliminating annates completely with no replacement revenue—financially destroying the papacy and guaranteeing schism. This decree preserves a papal revenue stream while adding transparency and accountability. Something Pope Eugenius might actually accept as \"parallel legislation.\"\n\nThe Bohemian Peace (November 1433)\n\nThe news that made Abbott Rodrigo weep, by his own admission.\n\nOn November 30, 1433, the Council of Basel and the Kingdom of Bohemia signed the Compacts of Basel—a bilateral treaty ending thirty-five years of religious war. Not a decree imposed by victors, but a negotiated peace between equals. The Hussites received communion in both kinds, their central demand. The Church preserved doctrinal integrity through the doctrine of concomitance. Five crusades failed to achieve what dialogue accomplished in months.\n\nBishop Alfonso writes that Prokop the Great, the Taborite commander who defeated those five crusades, refused to sign. The radical wing rejects compromise. But the moderate Utraquists—the majority—have accepted peace.\n\nEmperor Sigismund, after seventeen years of war, will finally receive the Bohemian crown.\n\nYour delegation understood the significance immediately. Abbott Rodrigo's letter reads: \"If the Council can end the Hussite Wars through words rather than swords, Your Majesty's vision of parallel legislation becomes not merely hopeful but proven. What was accomplished for Bohemia can be accomplished for the universal Church.\"\n\nThe Crusade Decree (December 14, 1433)\n\nThis is the matter closest to your heart, and the news is... mixed.\n\nSession 19 passed the Decree for the Defense of Constantinople with extraordinary conciliar support. Abbott Rodrigo reports the vote was nearly unanimous—a remarkable achievement given Basel's usual factional paralysis.\n\nBut the details reveal both triumph and limitation:\n\nWhat the decree achieves:\n\nConstantinople explicitly named as THE singular objective\n\nSultan Murad II identified by name as the adversary\n\nWall repair specifically mentioned as primary goal\n\nConcrete timeline: forces to assemble by summer 1434\n\nCrusade financing mechanisms established through metropolitan structures and Florentine banks\n\nWhat the decree lacks:\n\nOnly two concrete military commitments: Castile (your thousand knights and sixty thousand florins, already pledged before the decree) and the Knights of St. John\n\nNo other Christian prince has committed forces\n\nNo designated supreme military commander\n\nNo resolution of the Greek schism question—the decree neither demands union as a precondition nor calls the Orthodox \"brothers,\" simply referring to \"Christians in peril\"\n\nNo termination clause defining when the crusade ends\n\nBishop Alfonso's assessment is blunt: \"The decree is, in essence, an ecclesiastical endorsement of Your Majesty's personal crusade, dressed in the language of pan-Christian mobilization. You will receive the Council's blessing and the legitimacy of conciliar authority. You will not receive significant military reinforcement from other kingdoms.\"\n\nThe termination problem particularly concerns you. The decree states forces shall remain \"until the walls are repaired and the Empire can restore its own forces.\" But the Byzantine treasury is empty. Their military has been collapsing for decades. That condition could remain unfulfilled indefinitely.\n\nCurrent Council Dynamics (as of January-February 1434)\n\nAbbott Rodrigo's most recent letter, which reached you at Barcelona, describes a council exhausted by its own success. The reform decrees are passed. The Bohemian peace is signed. The crusade is proclaimed. Now the French faction pushes again for the constitutional question—whether councils stand above popes.\n\nCardinal Cesarini walks a knife's edge, trying to prevent Cardinal d'Allemand from forcing a vote on papal supremacy that would rupture any possibility of cooperation with Eugenius.\n\nFray Hernando—no longer at Basel, but with you on this voyage—has been replaced in the delegation by other Castilian clergy. Your delegation remains, in Abbott Rodrigo's words, \"the moderate faction's best friend—respected by Germans, tolerated by French, trusted by Cesarini.\"\n\nBut the old abbot is seventy-three years old, and his letters have grown shorter. Bishop Alfonso carries more of the burden now.\n\nThe barge passes beneath a crumbling Roman bridge—ancient stonework supporting medieval wooden repairs. Ahead, the bulk of Castel Sant'Angelo grows larger.\n\nYou carry all this in your satchel, and in your mind. The question is what you will do with it when you stand before Pope Eugenius IV."

          "text": "For concomitance - this is the Catholic doctrine that Christ is fully present (body, blood, soul, and divinity) under each species of the Eucharist. So if you receive only the bread, you still receive the whole Christ. This was important for the Hussite compromise because it meant the Church could grant communion in both kinds to Bohemians while maintaining that those who received only bread elsewhere weren't receiving \"less\" of Christ.\n\nFor the pluralism loophole - historically, anti-pluralism decrees failed because the Pope could simply grant dispensations allowing clergy to hold multiple benefices. The new decree closes this by:\n1. Making dispensations granted by local ordinaries (bishops), not Rome\n2. Limiting dispensations to only three narrow causes\n3. Grandfathering existing arrangements but not allowing renewals\n\nFor what's left at Basel - the major constitutional question (Haec Sancta - whether councils are superior to popes) remains unresolved. Also Greek reunion negotiations, ongoing implementation questions, and the French faction's push to assert conciliar supremacy over the Pope.\n\nLet me write this as a scene with Fray Hernando explaining.\n\nFray Hernando sits across from you on the barge, his grey Franciscan habit travel-worn but clean. The journey from Barcelona has restored some color to his cheeks—he is no longer the exhausted man who worked through the night drafting the Declaration of Como, though the lines around his eyes have deepened.\n\nHe considers your question with the careful attention he gives to all matters of doctrine.\n\n\"Concomitance,\" he says, \"is the teaching that Christ is wholly present—body, blood, soul, and divinity—under each species of the Eucharist. When you receive the bread alone, you receive the entire Christ. When you receive the wine alone, you receive the entire Christ. The two species are not two halves of a whole.\"\n\nHe watches Catalina at the bow, still demanding bird names from the patient Doña Leonor, before continuing.\n\n\"This matters for Bohemia because it allowed the Council to grant the Hussites what they wanted—communion in both kinds—without admitting that the rest of Christendom has been receiving an incomplete sacrament for centuries. The Bohemians get their chalice. The Church maintains that those who receive bread alone are not deprived of anything. Both sides preserve their dignity.\" A slight smile. \"Theological face-saving, Your Majesty. The Council has become skilled at it.\"\n\nOn the question of pluralism, Fray Hernando's expression sharpens.\n\n\"The loophole was simple, and it destroyed every previous reform. The Fourth Lateran Council prohibited pluralism in 1215. The prohibition lasted perhaps a decade before it became meaningless. Why?\" He holds up a finger. \"Because Rome could grant dispensations. A bishop holds three dioceses? Forbidden by canon law—unless the Pope grants a dispensation. And dispensations were always granted, for the right price or the right connections.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"Every anti-pluralism decree for two hundred years has been undermined the same way. The law says 'no,' but the Pope says 'yes, for you, this once'—and 'this once' becomes always, for everyone who matters.\"\n\n\"The Basel decree closes this by removing dispensations from Rome entirely. Now only the local ordinary—the bishop—can grant dispensation, and only for three narrow causes: two tiny benefices that together barely feed a man, benefices annexed by ancient right, or university professors who need support while teaching. That is all. Cardinals, archbishops, papal favorites—none of them can receive dispensation from Rome, because Rome no longer grants them.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"And the grandfathering provision is clever. Those who currently hold multiple benefices lawfully, with existing dispensations, may keep them for life. But when they die, the arrangement dies with them. No renewal, no inheritance, no perpetuation. The abuse ends naturally, without requiring mass deprivations that would create chaos.\"\n\nYour third question makes him sigh.\n\n\"Can the Council conclude? In principle, yes. The stated purposes—ending the Bohemian heresy, reforming the Church in head and members—have been substantially addressed. The Hussites are reconciled. The reform decrees are passed. The crusade is proclaimed.\"\n\nHe looks toward Rome, now visible as a jumble of towers and domes beyond the Castel Sant'Angelo.\n\n\"But the Council will not conclude, Your Majesty, because the real question was never Bohemia or reform. The real question is Haec Sancta—the decree of Constance that declared councils superior to popes. Cardinal d'Allemand and the French faction came to Basel to finish what Constance started. They want a permanent constitutional settlement that places the papacy under conciliar authority forever.\"\n\nFray Hernando's voice drops. \"They have been patient. They supported the reform decrees because reform strengthens the Council's legitimacy. They supported the Bohemian peace because success proves the Council's necessity. They supported the crusade decree because it demonstrates the Council can act where popes cannot. But all of this, for them, is preparation for the final battle.\"\n\n\"Eugenius has not accepted the reform decrees as papal legislation. He has not endorsed the Compacts. He tolerates Basel because he cannot suppress it, but he has not surrendered his claims. The French faction will eventually force a vote on supremacy—whether the Pope must obey the Council or the Council must obey the Pope. When that vote comes...\"\n\nHe trails off, watching a flock of starlings wheel above the riverbank.\n\n\"When that vote comes, Your Majesty, everything we have built may shatter. The reform decrees become weapons in a constitutional war rather than foundations for a renewed Church. The Bohemian peace becomes a precedent for councils overruling popes on doctrine. The crusade becomes a sideshow while Rome and Basel tear each other apart.\"\n\nThe barge rounds a final bend. The Castel Sant'Angelo looms directly ahead now, its massive cylinder reflected in the brown water.\n\n\"So no. The Council cannot conclude. Not until someone wins. Or until someone finds a way for both sides to stop fighting without either side admitting defeat.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"Which is, I believe, why you insisted on coming to Rome before Constantinople. And why you carry the Declaration of Como in your satchel.\""

The \"official\" end came when the anti-pope Felix V abdicated and the remaining Basel fathers submitted to Nicholas V.\n\nFray Hernando would know all this - he's a Franciscan theologian who has spent time at Basel. He can explain the mechanics.\n\nLet me have him give a clear, historically grounded answer that helps the player understand the institutional dynamics.\n\nFray Hernando tilts his head, appreciating the precision of your questions.\n\n\"You think like a king, Your Majesty. You see a problem and ask: how do we end it? But councils do not work like kingdoms.\"\n\nHe shifts on the cushions, finding a more comfortable position as the barge rocks gently.\n\n\"If the radicals force a vote and lose—say, Cardinal d'Allemand demands a decree declaring councils perpetually superior to popes, and the German moderates vote it down—what happens?\" He shrugs. \"Nothing. The radicals remain at Basel. They continue attending sessions. They wait. They try again in six months, or a year, when circumstances favor them. A lost vote is a delay, not a defeat.\"\n\n\"And if someone proposed a decree affirming papal authority?\" He actually laughs, a short bark without much humor. \"The French faction would never allow it to reach a vote. They would raise procedural objections. They would demand it be referred to the deputation of faith for study. They would walk out and hold their own session, declaring the other session illegitimate. Basel operates by consensus of the four deputations—faith, peace, reform, and common affairs. Any faction with enough votes in even one deputation can obstruct almost anything.\"\n\nHe leans forward, warming to the topic as scholars do.\n\n\"As for who determines when the Council concludes—this is the constitutional question that has no settled answer. Three possibilities exist in theory.\"\n\nHe raises one finger. \"First: the Pope dissolves the Council. Pope Eugenius tried this in December 1431, immediately after his election. He issued the bull Quoniam alto, commanding the Council to disperse and reconvene at Bologna in eighteen months.\" Fray Hernando's expression is dry. \"The Council refused. They declared that a legitimately assembled council cannot be dissolved, transferred, or prorogued by the Pope without conciliar consent. They continued meeting as if the bull did not exist. Eugenius eventually had to rescind his dissolution and recognize the Council's legitimacy, because he could not enforce his command.\"\n\nA second finger. \"Second: the Council votes to dissolve itself. This requires agreement across all four deputations—a consensus that the Council's work is complete. In principle, possible. In practice...\" He gestures vaguely toward the city ahead. \"Who decides when 'reform of the Church in head and members' is complete? The French faction will say reform is incomplete until papal supremacy is broken. The moderates will say reform is complete when the decrees are passed. They will never agree.\"\n\nA third finger. \"Third: Pope and Council agree jointly to conclude. This is what happened at Constance—the Council ended by mutual consent after resolving the schism. But Constance ended because both sides wanted it to end. Martin V was elected, the schism was healed, everyone was exhausted. Basel is different. Neither side wants to end it on the other's terms.\"\n\nHe drops his hand and looks at you with something like sympathy.\n\n\"You are asking whether there is a mechanism to simply stop the conflict. There is not. The Council continues until one side wins decisively, or until both sides exhaust themselves into irrelevance, or until some external force—invasion, plague, the death of key figures—changes the calculus entirely.\"\n\nThe barge passes into the shadow of the Castel Sant'Angelo. Above you, papal guards watch from the battlements.\n\n\"Constance lasted four years and ended in triumph. The Council of Basel has already sat for three years with no end in sight. It could continue for another decade. It could still be meeting when Catalina is grown.\"\n\nLucia, who has been listening quietly while resting against the cushions, speaks for the first time.\n\n\"Then what is the point of the parallel legislation Juan carries? If neither side will yield, what does it accomplish?\"\n\nFray Hernando turns to her with evident respect. \"An excellent question, Your Majesty. The parallel legislation does not end the conflict. It... routes around it. If Pope Eugenius adopts the reform decrees on his own authority—the same text, issued as papal legislation—then the substance of reform is achieved regardless of who wins the constitutional war. The Church is reformed whether councils rule popes or popes rule councils.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"The French faction would hate this, of course. They want reform to prove conciliar supremacy. If the Pope simply adopts the reforms himself, their victory becomes hollow. They reformed the Church... and gained nothing from it.\"\n\n\"Which is precisely why they may try to prevent parallel legislation from succeeding. And why your audience with Eugenius matters so much, Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe barge bumps gently against a wooden dock. Roman porters wait to receive you, and beyond them, the eternal city sprawls in the afternoon light."

The \"seven years after\" council would have been due around 1430-1431, which is when Basel was called.\n\nLet me think about how Fray Hernando would explain this - he's a scholar who would know the details. The user's question assumes Martin just ignored Frequens until Basel in 1431, but that's not quite accurate. There was a council in 1423-1424, it just failed.\n\nI need to be careful here about the historical facts. Let me verify:\n\nCouncil of Constance: 1414-1418\nFrequens (1417): \n- Next council in 5 years (1423)\n- Then 7 years after that (1430)\n- Then every 10 years\n\nCouncil of Pavia-Siena: 1423-1424 (called by Martin V per Frequens, moved due to plague, dissolved with little accomplished)\n\nCouncil of Basel: Called by Martin V for 1431 (the \"7 years after\" council, slightly late), Martin died February 1431, council opened under Eugenius IV\n\nMartin V's attempt to follow Frequens reveals a complex historical narrative. The Pavia-Siena council's failure highlights the challenges of implementing regular ecclesiastical assemblies. Eugenius IV's inheritance of the Basel Council adds another layer of complexity to the papal succession and conciliar reform efforts.\n\nFray Hernando's eyebrows rise—the expression of a teacher pleased by a student's attentiveness.\n\n\"You have read Frequens, Your Majesty. Good.\" He holds up a hand as the porters begin to bustle around the barge. \"But you have the dates slightly wrong, and the history is more complicated than simple papal defiance.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers as the barge is secured to the dock.\n\n\"Constance opened in 1414 and closed in 1418, after electing Martin V. Frequens was passed in 1417, requiring councils at intervals of five years, then seven, then every ten years thereafter. So: a council in 1423, another in 1430, then 1440, 1450, and so on into perpetuity.\"\n\n\"Martin did summon a council for 1423, as required. It met at Pavia.\"\n\nHe grimaces. \"It was a disaster. Poorly attended—most bishops found excuses not to come. Then plague broke out in Pavia, and the council transferred to Siena. More plague. More empty seats. The French were fighting among themselves and sent almost no one. The Germans were distracted by Hussite wars. The Spanish kingdoms were consumed by their own quarrels.\"\n\nThe porters have laid a gangplank. Fray Hernando remains seated, finishing his explanation.\n\n\"Martin dissolved the Council of Pavia-Siena in 1424, having accomplished almost nothing. He was not defying Frequens—he had called the council as required. But a council that no one attends is merely an empty room with candles.\"\n\nHe stands slowly, stretching muscles stiff from the river journey.\n\n\"The next council was due seven years later—1430 or 1431. Martin called it for Basel, to open in March 1431. He chose Basel precisely because it was convenient to the Germans, hoping for better attendance than Pavia. And because the Hussite question had grown desperate—five crusades had failed, and someone had to negotiate with the Bohemians.\"\n\n\"But Martin died in February 1431, weeks before the council opened. His successor, Eugenius IV, inherited a council he did not summon, in a city he did not choose, to address problems he had not created.\"\n\nFray Hernando steps onto the gangplank, then pauses to look back at you.\n\n\"Eugenius tried to dissolve Basel immediately, as I mentioned. The council refused. And here we are, three years later, with Pope and Council still at war over who commands whom.\"\n\nHe offers a thin smile. \"So you see, Your Majesty—Martin did not ignore Frequens. He complied with the letter of the law. But compliance and success are not the same thing. Pavia-Siena proved that you can summon a council and still accomplish nothing. Basel is proving that a council can accomplish much and still tear the Church apart.\"\n\nLucia has risen carefully, one hand on her belly, and Captain Fernán moves to assist her onto the dock. Catalina is already ashore, tugging at Doña Leonor's hand and pointing at a Roman soldier's plumed helmet.\n\n\"The question,\" Fray Hernando continues quietly, as you prepare to disembark, \"is whether anyone learned anything from Pavia's failure. Or whether we are doomed to repeat it, with higher stakes and sharper knives.\""

          "text": "The Council of Basel had a unique voting structure - it operated through four \"deputations\" (committees): faith, peace, reform, and common affairs. Each deputation had to approve measures before they went to general session. This gave minorities significant blocking power.\n\nThe French faction, led by Cardinal Louis d'Aleman (Archbishop of Arles), was the most radical conciliarist group. They wanted to establish permanent conciliar supremacy over the papacy.\n\nHowever, I should be careful here - I need to think about what Fray Hernando would know and how he would explain this. The French faction was significant but not necessarily dominant. The German moderates under figures like Nicholas of Cusa (before he switched sides) were also powerful. The Council's composition changed over time as well.\n\nLet me consider what's historically accurate:\n- The Council of Basel had an unusual democratic structure where even lower clergy could vote\n- The deputations gave blocking power to minorities\n- The French faction was influential but faced opposition from German moderates and others\n- Cardinal Cesarini tried to maintain balance as president\n- Over time, moderates began leaving Basel, which strengthened the radicals proportionally\n\nFray Hernando should give a nuanced answer about the faction's strength and how the council's structure affects power dynamics.\n\nFray Hernando pauses on the dock, letting the porters handle the baggage while he considers your question. The Roman afternoon sun catches the grey in his tonsured hair.\n\n\"Strong enough to obstruct. Not strong enough to command.\" He folds his hands into his sleeves. \"But the Council's structure makes obstruction almost as powerful as command.\"\n\nHe glances around, ensuring no Roman clergy are within earshot—papal territory demands discretion when discussing conciliar politics.\n\n\"You must understand how Basel votes, Your Majesty. It is unlike any parliament or cortes you have seen. The Council does not vote by nation, as Constance did. It does not vote by rank—bishops over abbots over doctors. Instead, it operates through the four deputations: faith, peace, reform, and common affairs. Every member of the Council is assigned to one deputation. Every deputation must approve a measure before it reaches the general session. And within each deputation, a simple majority carries the vote.\"\n\nHe steps aside as porters carry a trunk past him.\n\n\"This means that every priest, every abbot, every doctor of theology has the same vote as a cardinal or archbishop. A Franciscan friar from Lyon counts equally with the Archbishop of Trier.\"\n\n\"Now consider what this means for the French faction.\"\n\nFray Hernando's voice takes on the precise cadence of a man who has spent eight months watching these dynamics unfold.\n\n\"Cardinal d'Allemand does not command a majority of the Council. If you counted heads across all four deputations, the moderates—Germans, Castilians, some Italians, the Emperor's supporters—likely outnumber the French radicals. This is why the reform decrees passed. This is why the Bohemian peace was achieved. On matters of genuine reform, the moderates can assemble enough votes.\"\n\n\"But Cardinal d'Allemand does not need a majority to obstruct. He needs only to control one deputation sufficiently to prevent measures from reaching the general session. And he needs allies willing to use procedural tactics—demanding referrals, raising objections, questioning credentials, walking out to deny quorum.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers again. \"The French have perhaps sixty to eighty committed supporters. The University of Paris sends a steady stream of doctors who vote as d'Allemand directs. French bishops and abbots follow their cardinal. Some Burgundians align with them, though Burgundy's politics are complex. A scattering of radical conciliarists from other nations who genuinely believe councils must rule popes.\"\n\n\"Against them, the Germans number perhaps one hundred to one hundred twenty, but they are divided between Sigismund's loyalists, who want cooperation with Rome, and those who simply want reform regardless of constitutional questions. The Italians are few—most Italian clergy stay close to Rome rather than traveling to Basel. The Spanish delegations—Castile, Aragon, Portugal—are small but respected. The English send almost no one; they are consumed by their French wars.\"\n\n\"So when you ask how strong the French faction is...\"\n\nFray Hernando spreads his hands.\n\n\"They cannot pass a decree of papal deposition over moderate opposition. They tried to force this issue in 1432, before the Declaration of Como, and failed. The Germans would not support it.\"\n\n\"But they can prevent any decree that favors papal authority. They can block attempts to conclude the Council. They can ensure that every session becomes a battlefield over procedure and precedent. They can make Basel so hostile to Eugenius that he refuses to cooperate with any conciliar legislation, even reforms he might otherwise accept.\"\n\nHe looks toward the city, toward the Vatican visible in the distance.\n\n\"And there is a deeper problem, Your Majesty. The moderates grow weary. Bishop Alfonso writes that attendance has declined since the great decrees passed. Men who came to Basel for reform have achieved reform; they wish to go home to their dioceses. Men who came for the Bohemian peace have achieved peace; they see no reason to remain.\"\n\n\"But the French radicals do not go home. They stay. They wait. They attend every session while others drift away. And as the moderates leave, the radicals become proportionally stronger.\"\n\nFray Hernando's expression is grim.\n\n\"Time favors Cardinal d'Allemand, Your Majesty. Every month that passes without resolution, his faction grows stronger relative to those who remain. If this continues another two or three years, he may yet command the majority he currently lacks.\"\n\nLucia has reached the dock now, Catalina pulling at her hand impatiently. The child has discovered a street vendor selling roasted nuts and is making her desires known with characteristic volume.\n\n\"This is why parallel legislation matters,\" Fray Hernando concludes quietly. \"If Eugenius adopts the reforms now, while the moderates still hold Basel, the substance is secured regardless of what happens later. If he waits, hoping the Council will collapse on its own... he may wait too long.\""

          "text": "**The mechanics of council voting:**\n- Four deputations, each must approve before general session\n- Simple majority within each deputation\n- New arrivals would be assigned to deputations\n\n**Problems with the strategy:**\n\n1. **Deputation assignment**: Who assigns new arrivals to deputations? If the Council leadership (which includes French sympathizers) controls this, they could assign Italian newcomers to deputations where they'd be outnumbered, or spread them thin across all four.\n\n2. **Credentials challenges**: The French faction could challenge the credentials of sudden Italian arrivals, demanding proof they were legitimately appointed, delaying their seating for months.\n\n3. **Perception problem**: A sudden flood of Italian clergy arriving specifically to vote for dissolution would be seen as naked papal manipulation. This could actually strengthen the French narrative that the Pope is trying to suppress legitimate reform.\n\n4. **French walkout**: If the radicals see they're about to be outvoted on dissolution, they could simply walk out and declare a rump council. They might claim the \"true\" council continues without the papal stooges. This happened at various points in church history.\n\n5. **The question of what a \"concluded\" council means**: Even if Basel votes to dissolve, Cardinal d'Allemand could claim the vote was illegitimate and continue meeting. The Council has already ignored one papal dissolution (1431). Why would French radicals accept an Italian-dominated dissolution vote?\n\n6. **Eugenius's reluctance**: Would Eugenius actually want to legitimize Basel by signing its decrees? This is a real strategic question. \n\nBy signing, he acknowledges the Council has authority to pass meaningful legislation. Some papal advisors would argue he should never concede this point, as it undermines papal supremacy and could set a dangerous precedent for future church governance.\n\n7. **Italian clergy availability**: Gathering enough Italian bishops and abbots for this plan seems improbable. The journey to Basel is long and costly, and most prefer staying near Rome where real ecclesiastical power resides. The logistical challenges alone make this strategy highly risky.\n\n**What Fray Hernando might say:**\n\nHe would likely dissect the proposal's practical challenges, drawing from his eight-month experience at Basel. The procedural complexities make this strategy more theoretical than feasible. The key insight is that the Council isn't just a simple legislative body, but a complex political ecosystem with multiple competing factions and intricate rules of engagement.\n\nA nuanced approach might prove more effective: gradually erode the Council's legitimacy through strategic concessions and procedural maneuvering. By signing decrees and allowing moderate voices to slowly undermine the Council's purpose, Eugenius could potentially neutralize the reform movement without direct confrontation. The goal would be a slow, almost imperceptible decline in the Council's relevance, ultimately leading to its natural dissolution.\n\nFray Hernando stops walking. The Roman street bustles around you—porters, merchants, a Franciscan brother hurrying past with a basket of bread—but he stands still, studying you with an expression you recognize. It is the look he gives when you have said something that requires genuine thought rather than ready answers.\n\n\"You are proposing to flood the Council,\" he says slowly. \"To change its composition so dramatically that the French faction becomes a minority even with their current numbers unchanged.\"\n\nHe gestures for you to step aside, into the shade of a crumbling Roman archway, away from the bustle of the dock. Captain Fernán keeps the porters moving while Lucia waits with Catalina and the ladies, understanding that this conversation requires privacy.\n\n\"Let me think through this with you, Your Majesty. The strategy has... merit. But also difficulties.\"\n\n\"First, the mechanics.\"\n\nHe leans against the ancient stonework, arms folded.\n\n\"New arrivals at Basel are assigned to deputations by the Council's administrative officers. In theory, this is done to balance the deputations. In practice, it is political. If one hundred Italian clergy arrive at once, all known to favor dissolution, the officers—who include French sympathizers—could scatter them across all four deputations, diluting their impact. Or they could delay seating them while 'verifying credentials,' which can take months. Or they could assign them all to the deputation of common affairs, which handles administrative matters but rarely touches constitutional questions.\"\n\nHe holds up a hand before you can respond.\n\n\"This is not insurmountable. If Eugenius coordinates with Cardinal Cesarini, who still holds significant influence as papal legate, the assignments could be managed. But it requires preparation and allies within the Council's administration.\"\n\n\"Second, the perception.\"\n\nFray Hernando's expression grows more troubled.\n\n\"If one hundred Italian clergy arrive in Basel carrying papal legislation, and immediately begin voting to conclude the Council, what will Cardinal d'Allemand say?\"\n\nHe answers his own question, his voice taking on a mocking French accent.\n\n\"'The Pope has sent his lackeys to suppress legitimate reform! These are not independent prelates seeking the good of the Church—they are Roman agents doing Roman bidding! Their votes should not count because they did not come to deliberate, but to execute a predetermined command!'\"\n\nHis voice returns to normal. \"And here is the problem, Your Majesty: he would not be entirely wrong. If the Italians arrive with the obvious purpose of ending the Council, their legitimacy is tainted. The moderates—the Germans who have worked for genuine reform—might not support a dissolution that looks like papal manipulation. They want the Council to end honorably, not to be strangled by Roman hands.\"\n\n\"Third, the walkout.\"\n\nFray Hernando pushes off from the wall, pacing in the small shaded space.\n\n\"Suppose your strategy succeeds. Suppose the Italians are seated, the votes are counted, and the Council of Basel votes to dissolve itself. What prevents Cardinal d'Allemand from simply... refusing to leave?\"\n\nHe stops, facing you.\n\n\"The French faction could declare the dissolution vote illegitimate. They could claim the Italian newcomers were not properly credentialed, or that the vote violated procedural requirements, or that a council cannot dissolve itself while reform remains incomplete. They could continue meeting—a rump council, perhaps, but a council nonetheless. They ignored Eugenius's dissolution in 1431. Why would they accept a dissolution orchestrated by his Italian supporters?\"\n\n\"You would have two bodies claiming to be the legitimate Council of Basel. One dissolved, one continuing. The schism you seek to prevent would occur anyway, merely in different form.\"\n\n\"And fourth...\"\n\nFray Hernando's voice softens.\n\n\"Would Eugenius actually do this? Would he sign the Basel decrees?\"\n\nHe glances toward the Vatican, visible over the rooftops.\n\n\"By signing, he acknowledges that Basel has passed legitimate legislation. He validates the Council's authority. Some of his advisors will argue he should never concede this—that he should wait for Basel to collapse under its own contradictions rather than dignifying it with papal endorsement.\"\n\n\"The annates decree alone reduces papal revenue by seventy-five percent. The pluralism decree strips Rome of the power to grant dispensations. These are not small concessions, Your Majesty. You are asking Eugenius to sign away powers his predecessors accumulated over centuries, and to do so in coordination with a council that has declared itself his superior.\"\n\nHe falls silent for a moment, watching a cat pick its way along the ancient stones.\n\n\"And yet...\"\n\nFray Hernando turns back to you.\n\n\"The core of your strategy is sound. You understand that the Council ends when there is nothing left to fight over. If Eugenius adopts the reforms, the reform grievance disappears. If the Bohemian peace holds, that grievance disappears. If Constantinople is defended, the crusade grievance disappears. What remains? Only the constitutional question—whether councils rule popes.\"\n\n\"And the constitutional question, by itself, is not enough to sustain Basel indefinitely. Men came to Basel for reform, for Bohemia, for crusade. If those are achieved, attendance will decline. The French faction cannot maintain a council alone. They need moderates present to give their proceedings legitimacy.\"\n\nHe strokes his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"A wiser strategy, perhaps, would be slower. Not a flood, but a tide. Eugenius signs the decrees—not because Basel demands it, but because reform is good and right. This removes the accusation that he opposes reform. Over months, Italian attendance increases—not dramatically, but steadily. The moderates, seeing reform achieved and papal cooperation offered, begin to argue that the Council's work is complete. The French find themselves increasingly isolated, defending a constitutional war that no one else wishes to fight.\"\n\n\"The Council does not end by dramatic vote. It ends by... exhaustion. By irrelevance. By men going home because there is nothing left to do. Cardinal d'Allemand can continue meeting with his French doctors if he wishes, but if no one else attends, he is merely an old man talking to himself in an empty cathedral.\"\n\nFray Hernando meets your eyes.\n\n\"This is slower than you would like, Your Majesty. It could take two years, perhaps three. But it ends the Council without creating a schism, without validating the charge of papal manipulation, and without giving the French a martyrdom to rally around.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Of course, this assumes Eugenius is willing to play a long game. And that nothing happens in the meantime to inflame passions further. And that you are willing to remain involved in church politics for years rather than months.\"\n\nA wry smile crosses his face.\n\n\"Which, I suspect, is precisely what the Declaration of Como committed you to. Whether you fully understood that at the time.\""

That a council claiming to represent the universal church needs to actually represent it\n4. The French are exploiting a loophole but their exploitation also undermines the council's claims\n5. This is precisely why Basel's constitutional claims are self-defeating\n\nThis is a sophisticated theological and political discussion. Fray Hernando should engage with it seriously.\n\nFray Hernando's expression shifts—the look of a teacher who has been waiting for a student to reach precisely this question.\n\n\"Now you have found the wound at the heart of conciliarism, Your Majesty.\"\n\nHe settles against the archway again, clearly prepared for a longer discussion. Lucia catches his eye and nods slightly, guiding Catalina toward the shade of a nearby fountain where the child can splash her fingers in the water while the adults talk.\n\n\"Let me answer your question with another question,\" Fray Hernando says. \"What gives Haec Sancta its authority?\"\n\nHe does not wait for you to respond.\n\n\"The decree claims that a general council, legitimately assembled in the Holy Spirit, representing the universal Church, holds authority directly from Christ—authority that even the Pope must obey in matters of faith, schism, and reform. This is the foundation of everything Basel claims.\"\n\n\"But consider: Haec Sancta was passed at Constance in 1415 by perhaps three hundred prelates, in the midst of a schism when three men claimed to be Pope and none commanded universal obedience. Was that assembly 'representing the universal Church'? The Greeks were not present. The Russians were not present. Most of Africa and Asia were not present. Spain was barely represented. Even within the Latin West, many bishops refused to attend because they did not recognize the council's legitimacy.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands. \"Yet we treat Haec Sancta as binding. Why? Because enough of Christendom accepted it as binding. Because it resolved the schism. Because Martin V was elected under its authority and ruled as Pope for ten years without repudiating it directly. Legitimacy came not from the mechanism, but from the acceptance.\"\n\n\"Now apply this to your question.\"\n\nFray Hernando's voice takes on a harder edge.\n\n\"You are correct that Basel's mechanism is absurd. A doctor of theology from Paris, who holds no pastoral responsibility, who shepherds no flock, who answers to no one but his university faculty, has the same vote as the Archbishop of Toledo, who governs a province of two million souls. A wandering friar can arrive in Basel, claim credentials, and vote on matters affecting the entire Church. The system practically invites manipulation.\"\n\n\"And you are also correct that a council reduced to a handful of attendees could, procedurally, pass any decree it wished. Fifty French doctors could vote tomorrow to depose Eugenius, elect a new Pope, and declare themselves the supreme authority in Christendom. The mechanism permits it.\"\n\nHe pauses, letting the implications settle.\n\n\"But would anyone obey?\"\n\n\"This is the distinction you are grasping toward, Your Majesty. There is procedural legitimacy—following the rules as written—and there is actual legitimacy—the acceptance of Christendom that makes decrees effective.\"\n\n\"The decrees Basel has passed so far carry weight because they were passed by a broadly-attended council with German, Castilian, Italian, English, and yes, French participation. The Compacts of Basel ended the Hussite Wars because Bohemia and the Empire and the moderate council fathers all accepted them. The reform decrees have moral force because they address genuine abuses that the whole Church acknowledges.\"\n\n\"But a decree passed by fifty Frenchmen in an empty cathedral? The Archbishop of Toledo would ignore it. The German princes would ignore it. The Italian bishops would laugh at it. Even if Cardinal d'Allemand waved Haec Sancta and screamed that councils are supreme, no one would care. A council that claims to represent the universal Church but manifestly does not... is merely a collection of men with opinions.\"\n\nFray Hernando pushes off from the wall and steps closer, lowering his voice.\n\n\"This is the trap the French faction has set for themselves, Your Majesty. They exploit the mechanism—flooding Basel with Parisian doctors, maintaining attendance while others leave, using procedures to obstruct and delay. But every manipulation undermines the legitimacy they claim to defend.\"\n\n\"When Cardinal d'Allemand packs the deputations with university theologians who have never governed a parish, he weakens the Council's claim to represent the Church. When the French faction remains while the Germans and Italians and Spaniards depart, they transform Basel from a general council into a French conventicle. They may retain procedural control, but they lose the moral authority that made Haec Sancta powerful in the first place.\"\n\nHe shakes his head slowly.\n\n\"The French do not see this. Or perhaps they see it and do not care. They believe that if they can pass decrees claiming authority, the authority becomes real. They confuse the words with the substance.\"\n\n\"And here is the deepest irony.\"\n\nFray Hernando's smile is thin and bitter.\n\n\"Pope Eugenius makes the same error in reverse. He believes that if he simply denies the Council's authority, it has none. He issues bulls declaring Basel dissolved, and when Basel continues meeting, he pretends this is mere rebellion that will eventually collapse. He refuses to engage with the reform decrees because engaging would acknowledge the Council's right to pass them.\"\n\n\"But denial does not make Basel disappear. The reform decrees exist. The Bohemian peace exists. The crusade decree exists. Bishops across Christendom read these documents and ask: 'Are these laws? Must I obey them?' And Eugenius has no answer except 'No, because I say no.'\"\n\n\"Which is precisely as weak as Cardinal d'Allemand saying 'Yes, because I say yes.'\"\n\nHe falls silent for a long moment, watching Catalina splash in the fountain while Doña Leonor tries to prevent her from soaking her dress entirely.\n\n\"You asked about a strategy to end the Council, Your Majesty. The true answer is this: the Council ends when both Pope and Council stop pretending that legitimacy flows from their own declarations.\"\n\n\"If Eugenius signs the reform decrees, he acknowledges that councils can do good work—but as parallel legislation, adopted by papal authority, not conceded to conciliar supremacy. He gains the moral high ground of reform while denying that he was compelled to reform.\"\n\n\"If the Council, in turn, accepts that its reforms have been adopted and its work is complete, it acknowledges that papal cooperation was necessary to make reform effective. It gains the substance of what it sought while quietly abandoning the claim that it could command the Pope.\"\n\n\"Both sides yield something. Both sides gain something. Neither side admits defeat.\"\n\nFray Hernando meets your eyes.\n\n\"This is what the Declaration of Como proposed, Your Majesty. This is what you must persuade Eugenius to accept. Not because it is philosophically pure—it is not. But because it is the only path that does not end in schism.\"\n\nHe glances toward the Vatican.\n\n\"Whether the Pope is wise enough to see this... that is what we are about to discover.\""

And the decree's division between them is one of its most significant—and controversial—innovations.\"\n\nHe gestures for you to walk with him toward the fountain where Lucia waits, speaking as you move through the Roman street.\n\n\"The Apostolic Camera—the Camera Apostolica—is the papal treasury. The central financial institution of the Roman Church.\"\n\n\"It funds everything the papacy does. The cardinals and their households. The papal curia—hundreds of secretaries, notaries, lawyers, scribes who administer Church affairs across Christendom. Diplomatic missions to every Christian court. The papal armies that defend the Papal States from condottieri and ambitious princes. Building projects—you will see scaffolding on St. Peter's when we reach the Vatican; it has been under construction for decades and will be for decades more.\"\n\nHe sidesteps a cart laden with wine barrels.\n\n\"The Camera also funds papal charity—hospitals, alms for the poor, ransoming of Christian captives from Muslim pirates. And it supports the papal household itself: the servants, the guards, the cooks, the physicians, the artists who glorify God through their work in Rome.\"\n\n\"All of this costs money. Enormous sums. The annates, along with other revenues—the Papal States' taxes, fees for dispensations and indulgences, Peter's Pence from England, crusade tithes—flow into the Camera to fund these operations.\"\n\n\"Now consider what happens when Basel reduces annates by seventy-five percent.\"\n\nFray Hernando's voice carries a note of grim practicality.\n\n\"The Camera's income collapses. Cardinals must reduce their households. Diplomatic missions are curtailed. Building projects halt. Papal armies shrink—which means the Papal States become vulnerable to anyone with a few hundred mercenaries and ambition.\"\n\n\"This is why I told you the historical Basel made a catastrophic error when they abolished annates entirely with no replacement. They did not merely reform the Church; they financially destroyed the institution that administered it. A Pope who cannot pay his servants cannot govern. A Pope who cannot defend his territories becomes a prisoner of whoever controls Rome.\"\n\nHe glances at you. \"The decree you carry is wiser. It reduces the Camera's income severely, but it does not eliminate it. The Pope retains something. He can still function, though more modestly. This is reform, not destruction.\"\n\n\"The metropolitans are a different matter entirely.\"\n\nYou have reached the fountain. Lucia rises carefully, one hand on her belly, while Doña Leonor surrenders Catalina to a nursemaid's care. Fray Hernando lowers his voice as your party prepares to continue toward your lodgings.\n\n\"A metropolitan archbishop presides over an ecclesiastical province—a collection of dioceses. The Archbishop of Toledo, for instance, is metropolitan over the suffragan bishops of Palencia, Segovia, Osma, Sigüenza, Cuenca, and others. The Archbishop of Tarragona holds the same authority over the Catalan and Aragonese dioceses.\"\n\n\"Traditionally, the metropolitan's role is supervisory. He confirms the election of bishops in his province. He hears appeals from diocesan courts. He convenes provincial synods to coordinate policy. He visits dioceses to ensure discipline is maintained.\"\n\n\"But metropolitans have been... weakened, Your Majesty. Over centuries, Rome has drawn authority upward. Appeals skip the metropolitan and go directly to Rome. Papal legates override provincial synods. Bishops seek confirmation from the Pope rather than their metropolitan. The institution remains, but hollowed out.\"\n\n\"The annates decree reverses this.\"\n\nFray Hernando's eyes are sharp now, the eyes of a man who has thought carefully about institutional structures.\n\n\"By directing half of annates revenues to the metropolitan rather than Rome, the decree gives metropolitans resources. Money to convene synods. Money to conduct visitations. Money to support poorer dioceses in their province. Money to maintain provincial administration.\"\n\n\"And resources mean power. A metropolitan with a full treasury can actually do the supervision he is supposed to do. He becomes a meaningful check on bishops who abuse their office. He becomes an alternative to appealing everything to Rome, which is slow and expensive and favors those who can afford Roman lawyers.\"\n\nHe pauses at a corner, orienting himself toward your lodgings.\n\n\"This is decentralization, Your Majesty. Power flowing from Rome back to the provinces. The French faction supports this because it weakens the papacy. The German moderates support this because they believe provincial churches should govern themselves more. The reform-minded support this because metropolitans on the ground can address abuses faster than distant Rome.\"\n\n\"But consider the implications for parallel legislation.\"\n\nFray Hernando's voice drops further.\n\n\"If Eugenius signs this decree as papal legislation, he is not merely reducing his own income. He is empowering potential rivals. Every metropolitan in Christendom becomes richer and more independent. Every provincial synod becomes more significant. The Church becomes less Roman and more... distributed.\"\n\n\"Some in the Curia will argue this is surrender. That Eugenius is dismantling the very institution he leads. That future Popes will curse his name for giving away powers that took centuries to accumulate.\"\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n\"Others will argue that a Church with stronger provinces is a healthier Church. That Rome tried to control everything and failed—corruption flourished precisely because distant oversight is ineffective. That metropolitans who can actually supervise their provinces will produce better bishops, better priests, better pastoral care.\"\n\nLucia has taken your arm as you walk. She speaks quietly. \"And what do you believe, Fray Hernando?\"\n\nThe Franciscan is silent for several steps.\n\n\"I believe, Your Majesty, that the Church of the Apostles had no Camera Apostolica and no centralized treasury. Peter did not levy annates. Paul did not dispatch legates to override local bishops. The early Church was communities—Antioch, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Rome—each governing itself, coordinating through councils when needed, united in faith rather than administration.\"\n\n\"Whether we can return to something like that without chaos... I do not know. But I know the current system is breaking. The question is whether it breaks through reform or through schism.\"\n\nHe gestures ahead to a modest palazzo flying Castilian colors—your lodgings, arranged in advance.\n\n\"Perhaps, Your Majesty, the question for Eugenius is not whether he wishes to share power with the metropolitans. Perhaps the question is whether he prefers to share it willingly, and retain some voice in how it is shared... or to have it torn from him by a council that despises him.\""

          "text": "\"Two different inquiries requiring two different approaches,\" Fray Hernando says slowly. \"The Camera is an institution. The Pope's feelings are... more delicate.\"\n\nLucia speaks before he can continue. \"May I, husband?\"\n\nYou nod.\n\n\"The Apostolic Camera is managed by the Camerlengo—the Chamberlain of the Holy Roman Church. Currently this is Cardinal François de Conzié.\" Lucia's voice carries the quiet confidence of someone who grew up hearing banking discussed at table. \"But the Camerlengo is a political appointment, close to the Pope. He will tell you nothing Eugenius does not wish you to hear.\"\n\nShe guides you around a puddle of questionable origin.\n\n\"Below the Camerlengo sits the Treasurer, and below him the clerks and auditors who actually manage the accounts. These men are bureaucrats, not politicians. They know exactly how much the Camera receives, from what sources, and what happens if those sources diminish.\"\n\n\"My family has dealt with Camera officials for decades. The Medici bank handles much of the papal finances—transfers, currency exchange, loans against future revenues.\" A thin smile. \"If you wish to understand what the annates reform would actually do to papal finances, you do not ask the Camerlengo. You ask a senior clerk who has spent thirty years balancing the ledgers.\"\n\nFray Hernando nods slowly. \"Can you arrange such a meeting, Your Majesty?\"\n\nLucia considers. \"I can write to our family's Roman agent. The Medici maintain a permanent representative here precisely because papal finances are so significant. He will know which Camera officials might speak candidly to a sympathetic ear—and which would report every word directly to the Camerlengo.\"\n\nShe pauses. \"But this must be handled delicately. If it appears that the King of Castile is investigating papal finances before his audience, Eugenius will hear of it within hours. The Vatican leaks like a Roman aqueduct.\"\n\n\"As for gauging the Pope's feelings...\"\n\nFray Hernando picks up the thread as you reach the palazzo's entrance. A Castilian servant opens the door, bowing deeply.\n\n\"You met Cardinal Giordano Orsini when you first came to Rome, Your Majesty. He was Martin's closest advisor, spoke fluent Castilian, and assessed your character before your audience with the dying Pope.\"\n\n\"I remember.\" The memory is vivid—Orsini's probing questions, his consultation with Fray Hernando, his evident surprise at finding genuine faith rather than political calculation.\n\n\"Orsini remains influential, but his position has changed. He was Martin's man. Eugenius is a Venetian—Gabriel Condulmer was his name before elevation—and he brought his own circle of advisors. The Orsini family and the Venetian faction are not enemies, but neither are they natural allies.\"\n\nFray Hernando follows you into the cool interior of the palazzo.\n\n\"Still, Orsini knows the Vatican better than almost anyone alive. He survived the transition from Martin to Eugenius. He understands the currents. And he remembers you favorably—your humility before Martin made an impression that he wrote about to Spanish bishops.\"\n\n\"There is another possibility,\" Lucia adds, settling carefully into a chair as servants bustle to prepare refreshments. Catalina has already discovered a courtyard with orange trees and is demanding to pick fruit.\n\n\"Cardinal Domenico Capranica.\"\n\nFray Hernando's eyebrows rise. \"The papal legate? He returned to Rome after the crusade, but—\"\n\n\"But he saw Granada, Fray Hernando. He witnessed what my husband accomplished. He examined the converted qadi and was moved to tears by the evidence of genuine faith.\" Lucia accepts a cup of watered wine from a servant. \"When we last saw him, he had transformed from a procedural bureaucrat into a genuine supporter of the crusade's spiritual mission.\"\n\nShe looks at you. \"Capranica is not Eugenius's closest confidant, but he has the Pope's ear. And he has seen what you can do. He can speak to Eugenius about your character from personal experience, not rumor.\"\n\n\"Moreover,\" she continues, \"Capranica cares about proper procedure—canonical correctness, as you may recall from Toledo.\" A slight edge enters her voice at the memory of the cardinal's demands regarding her Portuguese ladies. \"If you wish to know how Eugenius views the Basel decrees, ask Capranica how Rome interprets their canonical status. He will tell you whether the Vatican considers them legitimate legislation requiring response, or mere pretensions to be ignored.\"\n\nFray Hernando has been thinking while Lucia spoke.\n\n\"There is a risk in all of this, Your Majesty. Every conversation you have before the audience will be reported. Every question you ask reveals your intentions. If you inquire too closely about Camera finances, Eugenius will know you are preparing arguments about annates reform. If you probe too obviously about his feelings toward Basel, he will know you come as the Council's advocate.\"\n\nHe sits across from you, accepting his own cup of wine.\n\n\"Perhaps the wiser approach is to let others make inquiries on your behalf. Queen Lucia's family connections can explore the financial questions without your direct involvement. Cardinal Capranica might be approached by... someone from your household, expressing the King's gratitude for his service during the crusade and inquiring whether His Eminence might spare time for a private conversation.\"\n\n\"And Cardinal Orsini...\" Fray Hernando pauses. \"I could visit him. One Franciscan calling upon a cardinal who once interviewed him about his king's spiritual state. A pastoral conversation, not a political one. I can listen to what he says—and what he does not say—without committing you to any position.\"\n\nHe sets down his cup.\n\n\"The question is what you wish to learn, Your Majesty, and how much you are willing to reveal in the learning. Every inquiry is a signal. What signal do you wish to send before you stand before the Pope?\""

          "text": "Lucia leans forward, her eyes brightening with the particular interest she shows when conversation turns to matters of finance and trade.\n\n\"Now you are thinking like a Medici, husband.\"\n\nShe sets down her cup, her hands moving as she speaks—a habit, you have noticed, when her mind works quickly.\n\n\"The argument you are constructing is sound in principle. Let me explain what I know, and what we would need to confirm.\"\n\n\"The Great Schism lasted nearly forty years—1378 to 1417. For most of that time, two popes claimed authority, sometimes three. Each commanded obedience from different kingdoms. France followed Avignon. England, the Empire, and most of Italy followed Rome. Castile shifted allegiance multiple times. Portugal changed sides. Aragon changed sides.\"\n\nShe ticks off fingers. \"Now consider what this meant for annates. A bishop in Toulouse paid his annates to Avignon. A bishop in Milan paid to Rome. But a bishop in a contested region—Catalonia, for instance, or Navarre—might pay to neither, claiming uncertainty about legitimate authority. Or he might pay a reduced sum, pleading poverty while pocketing the difference. Who would enforce collection when two rival Cameras each claimed jurisdiction?\"\n\nFray Hernando nods slowly. \"I remember the chaos. Benefices were sometimes filled by both popes simultaneously—two men claiming the same bishopric, each with credentials from a different Rome. The lawsuits lasted decades.\"\n\n\"And the revenues,\" Lucia continues, \"were devastated. My grandfather spoke of it. The Medici began their rise precisely because someone had to manage the financial chaos. Papal debts accumulated. The Camera borrowed against future revenues at ruinous interest. When Martin V finally reunited the papacy, he inherited a treasury that was functionally bankrupt.\"\n\n\"Now consider the present situation.\"\n\nLucia rises and moves to a window, looking out at the Roman street.\n\n\"The schism is healed, but its effects linger. Collection mechanisms were disrupted for forty years. In distant provinces—Scandinavia, Poland, the edges of Christendom—the habit of paying annates fully and promptly was broken. Local bishops grew accustomed to retaining revenues that should have flowed to Rome. Metropolitan archbishops began treating certain incomes as their own by custom, regardless of canon law.\"\n\n\"My family's agents report that actual annates collection runs perhaps sixty to seventy percent of what canonical requirements demand. Some regions pay faithfully. Others pay partially. Others pay only when a papal legate arrives with threats of interdict—and even then, they negotiate reductions.\"\n\nShe turns back to face you.\n\n\"If the reform decree establishes clear rates, transparent accounting, and shared collection between Camera and metropolitans... the metropolitans have incentive to collect fully, because half goes to them. Currently they have no incentive—they are merely Rome's tax collectors, resented by their suffragans and unrewarded for their trouble.\"\n\nFray Hernando strokes his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"You are suggesting that twenty-five percent of revenues actually collected might equal or exceed one hundred percent of revenues theoretically owed but practically uncollectable.\"\n\n\"I am suggesting it is possible,\" Lucia replies carefully. \"I do not know the Camera's actual books. No one outside the Camera does—which is itself part of the problem the decree addresses. But the logic is sound. A smaller share of a larger, reliably-collected sum may exceed a larger share of a sum that exists only on parchment.\"\n\nShe returns to her seat. \"This is the inquiry I would make through our family's agent. Not 'will the Pope accept reform'—that is political. But 'what are actual collection rates across Christendom, and how do they compare to canonical requirements?' The Camera clerks know these numbers. They have watched revenues fluctuate for decades. They understand the gap between theory and practice.\"\n\n\"And,\" she adds, \"they are bureaucrats. They may privately welcome a reform that makes their work easier. Currently they must chase bishops who claim poverty, dispute assessments based on century-old valuations, and fight endless legal battles over contested benefices. A simpler system with metropolitan cooperation might appeal to men who have spent careers wrestling with the current chaos.\"\n\nFray Hernando shifts the conversation.\n\n\"For the Pope's own disposition, I can approach Cardinal Orsini. But I must be careful about what I ask.\"\n\nHe stands, pacing slowly as he thinks aloud.\n\n\"If I ask directly, 'Does Eugenius accept the Basel decrees?', Orsini will give me the official position—rejection, dismissal, the claim that Basel has no authority. This tells us nothing we do not already know.\"\n\n\"But if I ask differently...\" He pauses. \"If I speak of the King of Castile's sincere desire to serve Holy Mother Church. If I mention that His Majesty carries proposals from Como, developed with Emperor Sigismund, that might offer a path to peace. If I wonder aloud whether His Holiness might receive such proposals as genuine attempts at reconciliation rather than conciliar demands...\"\n\n\"Then Orsini's response—his tone, his hesitations, his choice of words—will tell me much. Does he dismiss the very idea? Does he express private sympathy? Does he suggest which arguments might resonate and which would offend?\"\n\nFray Hernando stops pacing.\n\n\"Orsini is old and has served the Church for fifty years. He remembers what the schism cost. He knows that another rupture could be worse. If there is any opening in Eugenius's position—any willingness to discuss rather than merely denounce—Orsini will know. And I believe he will tell me, because he remembers that I told him the truth about you four years ago, and events have proven me right.\"\n\n\"There is also Cardinal Capranica,\" Lucia adds. \"I could call upon him myself. A queen expressing gratitude for his service during the crusade, inquiring after his health, perhaps mentioning that her husband hopes to continue the good work Capranica witnessed in Granada...\"\n\nShe smiles slightly. \"Capranica is a canon lawyer. He cannot resist discussing canonical questions. If I express innocent confusion—'My husband speaks of something called parallel legislation, but I confess I do not understand what this means. Could Your Eminence explain?'—he will explain. At length. And in explaining, he will reveal how the Vatican understands the concept. Whether they see it as a possible solution or a conciliar trap.\"\n\nFray Hernando looks at Lucia with evident respect. \"You have done this before, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"I am a Florentine married to a Spanish king, living through a papal-conciliar crisis while pregnant with my first child.\" Her voice is dry. \"I have learned that information flows more freely when powerful men believe they are educating a curious woman rather than negotiating with an adversary.\"\n\nThe afternoon light slants through the palazzo windows. Somewhere in the courtyard, Catalina is singing a nonsense song to an orange she has managed to pick.\n\n\"So,\" Fray Hernando summarizes. \"Queen Lucia approaches the Medici agent regarding Camera finances, seeking the practical reality of annates collection. She also calls upon Cardinal Capranica to discuss canonical questions with appropriate feminine curiosity. I visit Cardinal Orsini as a Franciscan concerned for Church unity, listening for any opening in the papal position.\"\n\nHe looks at you. \"And you, Your Majesty, remain above these preliminary inquiries. You rest from your voyage. You attend to your daughter. You are seen visiting Roman churches as a pilgrim, not a politician. When you stand before Eugenius, you come with clean hands—your household has made no demands, offered no threats, revealed no strategies.\"\n\n\"Whatever we learn, we share with you before the audience. And then you will know better what arguments might move this Pope, and which would only harden his resistance.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"Does this approach suit you, Your Majesty? Or would you proceed differently?\""

The Medici agent refuses to make inquiries. He values his relationship with the Camera more than Florentine family connections. He explains nothing—simply says it cannot be done and changes the subject. Lucia learns nothing except that the Vatican is more guarded than she expected.\n11-25\nPolite Evasion. The agent arranges a meeting with a junior Camera clerk who speaks in generalities. \"Collection varies by province, Your Majesty. Some pay faithfully, others less so. I could not give you figures.\" The clerk is pleasant but reveals nothing of substance. Lucia senses fear beneath the courtesy.\n26-40\nOfficial Position Only. A mid-level Camera official agrees to meet but delivers only the institutional line: collection is adequate, rates are just, reform is unnecessary. He treats the inquiry as a test of loyalty and performs accordingly. Lucia learns what the Camera wants people to believe, not what is true.\n41-55\nFragments and Hints. Through careful conversation, Lucia pieces together implications rather than facts. A clerk mentions that \"certain provinces\" have been \"difficult\" since the schism. Another references \"ancient assessments\" that \"no longer reflect reality.\" She gains a sense that the problem exists but no concrete numbers.\n56-70\nOne Honest Voice. An aging clerk, perhaps near retirement with less to lose, speaks more freely—though still cautiously. He confirms that actual collection runs \"perhaps two-thirds\" of canonical requirements in good years, less in bad. He will not name specific provinces or give written documentation. He asks that his name never be mentioned.\n71-85\nThe Ledger Glimpse. Through a combination of Medici pressure and careful cultivation, Lucia gains access to summary figures—not the full accounts, but enough to confirm the gap between theory and practice. Collection rates vary from 90% in Italy to perhaps 40% in distant provinces. The schism's disruption is documented. She has something concrete to work with.\n86-95\nA Sympathetic Expert. A senior Camera auditor, privately frustrated with the current system's inefficiencies, agrees to an extended private conversation. He explains the collection problems in detail: valuations centuries out of date, no enforcement mechanism for distant provinces, corruption in the collection chain. He believes reform could improve actual revenues but will not say so publicly. He wants something in return—perhaps Castilian support for his advancement, or assurance his name stays protected.\n96-100\nThe Hidden Reformer. Lucia discovers that someone within the Camera has already prepared analysis showing that reduced rates with metropolitan cooperation could maintain or exceed current actual revenues. This person has been waiting for someone powerful enough to carry the argument to the Pope. They are willing to share their work—but only if Lucia can guarantee their protection from retaliation. A potential ally, but one who demands much.\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty.\n\nShall I also draft tables for Fray Hernando's approach to Cardinal Orsini and Lucia's conversation with Cardinal Capranica?"

Catalina has been put down for her nap—a battle, by all accounts, involving three nursemaids and a promised story about horses—and the household has settled into the quiet rhythms of a Roman siesta.\n\nLucia returns from her errand looking composed but thoughtful. She finds you in the small study the palazzo's owner has provided, removes her light traveling cloak, and settles into a chair across from you with the careful movements of early pregnancy.\n\n\"The Medici agent is named Francesco Bardi,\" she begins without preamble. \"A cousin of my mother's, third removed. He was... accommodating. Up to a point.\"\n\nShe accepts a cup of watered wine from a servant, waits until the door closes.\n\n\"He arranged a meeting with a clerk from the Camera. A young man—perhaps twenty-five, dressed well but not expensively. The kind of man who hopes to rise but has not yet risen.\"\n\nWhat Lucia Learned:\n\n\"The clerk was pleasant. Eager to help, he said. Very honored to meet a queen of such distinguished family.\" Her voice carries a note of dry amusement. \"He spoke for perhaps half an hour. I learned nothing.\"\n\nShe sets down her cup.\n\n\"When I asked about collection rates, he said they 'vary by province, as Your Majesty would expect.' When I asked how they vary, he said 'some pay more faithfully than others.' When I asked which provinces pay less faithfully, he said he 'could not speak to specific regions without consulting records he did not have to hand.'\"\n\n\"When I asked about the schism's impact on collection mechanisms, he said 'the Church has faced many challenges and overcome them through faith.' When I pressed for whether current collection matches canonical requirements, he said 'the Camera works diligently to fulfill its sacred responsibilities.'\"\n\nLucia's expression sharpens.\n\n\"He was not rude. He was not hostile. He answered every question I asked. And he told me nothing.\"\n\nWhat Lucia Sensed:\n\n\"There was fear beneath it, husband. Not fear of me—I am a pregnant Florentine woman asking about ledgers. Fear of something else.\"\n\nShe rises and moves to the window, looking out at the Roman afternoon.\n\n\"When I mentioned the Basel reforms—casually, as if making conversation—his face went still. Just for a moment. Then he smiled and said he 'could not comment on matters before the Holy Father.' But in that moment, I saw it. He knows the reforms would affect the Camera. He has opinions about them. And he will die before sharing those opinions with a foreign queen whose husband is about to meet the Pope.\"\n\nShe turns back to face you.\n\n\"Francesco was little better. He made the meeting happen, but he did not press when the clerk evaded. He did not offer to arrange a more senior contact. When I asked if there was someone else who might speak more freely, he said 'the Camera is a careful institution, cousin. They do not share their difficulties with outsiders.'\"\n\nLucia's Assessment:\n\n\"Two possibilities. Either the Camera's finances are healthy and they simply guard their information from habit.

A pastoral conversation, not political. Listening for what Orsini says and doesn't say.\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- Prior relationship: Orsini interviewed Hernando in 1430, found him honest\n- Franciscan humility: Less threatening than a diplomat\n- Pastoral framing: Not asking for commitments, just seeking counsel\n- Orsini is old and may be more reflective about the Church's future\n- Hernando's reputation for truth-telling proved accurate (Juan did what he said he would)\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- Orsini is a Vatican insider; discretion is his nature\n- He must be careful not to seem disloyal to Eugenius\n\n- Political tensions surround his every interaction\n- Venetian political networks closely monitor his connections\n- Family rivalries and institutional politics create constant pressure\n- Each conversation carries potential risk to his standing\n\nI see multiple layers of complexity in Orsini's potential responses. His political survival depends on carefully navigating these intricate social and institutional dynamics, making any conversation a delicate diplomatic dance.\n\nFRAY HERNANDO'S APPROACH TO CARDINAL ORSINI: D100 TABLE\n\nThe Approach: Fray Hernando visits Cardinal Giordano Orsini as a Franciscan who once submitted to the Cardinal's examination regarding King Juan's spiritual state. A pastoral conversation between men of the Church, not a diplomatic negotiation. Hernando seeks to understand whether any opening exists in Eugenius's position toward Basel and parallel legislation—listening for tone, hesitation, and implication rather than asking directly.\n\nWhat does Orsini want?\n\nTo remain relevant under a Pope he did not choose (Eugenius is Venetian; Orsini served Martin V)\n\nTo protect the institutional Church from schism\n\nTo avoid saying anything that could be used against him by either faction\n\nTo assess whether Juan is still the man Orsini remembers, or has become dangerous\n\nWhat won't Orsini say?\n\nDirect criticism of Eugenius's strategy\n\nWhether the Pope is privately more flexible than publicly\n\nAnything that commits him to a position\n\nWhether parallel legislation has genuine support in the Curia\n\nSuccess Factors (pushing toward higher results)\n\nPrior relationship: Orsini examined Hernando in 1430; found him honest and was proven right\n\nFranciscan framing: A friar seeking counsel is less threatening than a diplomat demanding answers\n\nShared concern: Both men genuinely fear schism and want the Church to survive\n\nHernando's reputation: He told the truth about Juan four years ago; events validated his assessment\n\nOrsini's age: Old men sometimes speak more freely, having less to lose\n\nFailure Factors (pushing toward lower results)\n\nInstitutional caution: Orsini has survived Vatican politics for fifty years by being careful\n\nChanged circumstances: Martin is dead; Orsini must prove loyalty to Eugenius\n\nFactional surveillance: The Venetian circle may be watching Martin's old allies\n\nStrategic timing: Everyone knows Juan seeks an audience; no conversation is innocent\n\nOrsini family politics: The great Roman families are entangled with papal power; he cannot act freely\n\nFour years of distance: Relationships cool; Orsini may not remember the warmth of 1430\n\nD100 TABLE: FRAY HERNANDO'S INQUIRY\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nThe Door Does Not Open. Cardinal Orsini sends word that he is indisposed and cannot receive visitors. No explanation, no alternative date offered. The message is delivered by a junior secretary who knows nothing. Hernando waits in an antechamber for two hours before receiving this dismissal. The Cardinal is avoiding him—whether from caution, instruction, or changed sentiment, Hernando cannot know.\n11-20\nPolite but Distant. Orsini receives Hernando briefly in a public room with secretaries present. The conversation remains entirely formal—health inquiries, blessings exchanged, memories of Pope Martin invoked with appropriate reverence. When Hernando gently raises the subject of Church unity, Orsini offers only platitudes: \"We must all pray for peace.\" The audience ends after fifteen minutes. Hernando leaves knowing less than when he arrived.\n21-35\nThe Official Position. Orsini speaks privately but delivers only what any Cardinal would say publicly. Basel overreaches. The Pope's authority is not subject to conciliar dictation. Reform is desirable but must come through proper channels. He thanks Hernando for Castile's faithful service and expresses hope that King Juan's audience will be fruitful. Nothing of substance; nothing that reveals the Pope's private thinking. Orsini is performing, not conversing.\n36-50\nWarmth Without Revelation. The old Cardinal seems genuinely pleased to see Hernando. They speak of Martin's final months, of Juan's remarkable humility in 1430, of how events in Granada validated their early assessment. But when conversation turns to present matters, Orsini grows careful. \"These are difficult times, brother. The Holy Father bears a heavy burden. I would not presume to speak for him.\" Hernando senses that Orsini has opinions but will not share them. The affection is real; the discretion is absolute.\n51-65\nReading Between Words. Orsini does not reveal Eugenius's position directly, but his silences speak. When Hernando mentions parallel legislation, Orsini does not dismiss it—he simply moves to another topic. When Hernando asks if the Pope rejects reform entirely, Orsini says \"His Holiness has not closed any doors.\" When asked about the annates decree specifically, Orsini notes that \"the Camera has many concerns\" without elaborating. Hernando must interpret, but there is something to interpret. The door may not be fully shut.\n66-80\nA Careful Confidence. After an hour of circling, Orsini dismisses his secretary and speaks more directly—though still guardedly. \"The Holy Father is not a fool, brother. He knows the Church cannot continue as it has. But he cannot appear to yield to Basel's demands. That would destroy his authority entirely.\" Orsini does not say what Eugenius will accept, but he suggests the problem is perception more than substance. He asks what Juan intends to propose—listening more than he answers. He is assessing whether Juan might offer a path Eugenius could take without losing face.\n81-90\nOld Loyalty Speaks. Something unlocks in Orsini—perhaps memory of Martin's trust in Juan, perhaps weariness with Vatican games, perhaps genuine fear of schism. He speaks with surprising frankness. \"Eugene is surrounded by men who tell him to stand firm and wait for Basel to collapse. Some of us believe this is... optimistic. The Council has accomplished things. The Bohemian peace alone—\" He stops himself, but the implication is clear. There are voices in the Curia who believe Eugenius is mishandling this crisis. Orsini will not say if he is among them, but he does not need to. He asks Hernando what the King of Castile would propose, and listens with genuine interest.\n91-100\nThe Cardinal's Private Fear. Orsini closes the door himself and speaks as one old man to another. \"I served Martin for fifteen years. I watched him heal the schism through patience and compromise. And I watch Eugene undo that work through pride.\" He is not offering to betray the Pope—but he is admitting, privately, that he believes Eugenius is making a catastrophic mistake. He asks if Juan truly has a proposal that could let both sides save face. If so, Orsini might—might—be willing to prepare the ground before Juan's audience. Not openly. Not in ways that could be traced. But a word here, a suggestion there. He wants to see the Declaration of Como. He wants to understand what Juan actually intends. He is not promising support; he is considering whether support might be possible.\n\nRoll when ready."

When Hernando raises Church unity, Orsini offers only platitudes. The audience ends after fifteen minutes. Hernando leaves knowing less than when he arrived.\n\nI need to write this scene. Remember:\n- Never generate dialogue or action for Juan\n- Stop and wait for player input\n- NPCs have their own agendas\n- NPCs don't explain themselves\n- NPCs don't help without getting something first\n\nWhat does Orsini want? He wants to survive under a Pope who is not his patron. He served Martin V; Eugenius is Venetian and brought his own people. Orsini needs to prove loyalty to the new regime. He cannot afford to be seen meeting privately with the confessor of a foreign king who just arrived from Basel and is known to carry proposals for papal-conciliar cooperation.\n\nWhat won't Orsini say? Anything that could be reported back to Eugenius's inner circle as disloyalty. Anything that reveals Vatican internal politics. Anything that commits him.\n\nLet me write Hernando's return and his report to Juan. The scene should show the frustration of the polite dismissal without Hernando explaining everything - Juan will need to draw his own conclusions.\n\nPolite but Distant\n\nThe evening bells have begun their cascade across Rome—first Santa Maria Maggiore, then the Lateran, then a dozen lesser churches joining in ragged chorus—when Fray Hernando returns to the palazzo. His grey habit is dusty from walking, and he moves with the stiffness of a man who has spent too long sitting on hard chairs in uncomfortable rooms.\n\nHe finds you in the study where Lucia left you an hour ago. She has gone to attend to Catalina's supper—a diplomatic retreat, you suspect, to allow confessor and king to speak privately.\n\nHernando lowers himself into a chair without asking permission. A liberty he takes only when tired or troubled.\n\n\"The Cardinal received me.\"\n\nHe pauses, as if deciding how to frame what follows.\n\n\"In the Sala dei Paramenti. A public receiving room. Three secretaries present, all taking notes. Two other visitors waiting their turn behind me.\"\n\nHe accepts wine when a servant offers it, drinks deeply, then continues.\n\n\"He remembered me. Spoke warmly of our examination in 1430. Asked after my health. Inquired whether the journey from Barcelona had been difficult. Expressed sorrow for the souls lost in the Mistral.\"\n\nHernando sets down the cup.\n\n\"Fifteen minutes, Your Majesty. Perhaps less. When I raised the matter of Church unity—carefully, obliquely, as one Franciscan concerned for Holy Mother Church—he smiled and said 'We must all pray for peace, brother. These are matters for wiser heads than ours.'\"\n\nThe Franciscan's voice carries a note of something you rarely hear from him: frustration.\n\n\"When I mentioned that I traveled now with the King of Castile, who bore proposals from Como, his expression did not change. He said he was certain His Holiness would receive Your Majesty with appropriate honor. He blessed me. He thanked me for my years of faithful service. And then he was already looking past my shoulder to the next visitor.\"\n\nHernando stares at his hands for a long moment.\n\n\"I have known Cardinal Orsini for four years. In 1430, he closed the door of his private study and questioned me for three hours about your soul. He consulted with me before advising Pope Martin. He wrote to me twice during the crusade, asking for my assessment of your spiritual progress.\"\n\nHe looks up.\n\n\"Today he treated me as a stranger with a letter of introduction. Courteous. Correct. And absolutely closed.\"\n\nThe bells continue their evening song. Somewhere in the palazzo, Catalina is singing along in her own invented language.\n\n\"Something has changed, Your Majesty. Either Cardinal Orsini has been instructed to avoid entanglements with your household. Or he has chosen caution for reasons of his own. Or the Vatican is more watchful than it was under Martin, and he dares not be seen in private conversation with the confessor of a king who comes from Basel.\"\n\nHernando's voice drops.\n\n\"I learned nothing of Eugenius's position. Nothing of whether parallel legislation might find reception. Nothing of the Pope's private thoughts or the counsel he receives. I learned only that a man who once trusted me enough to speak freely now trusts me only enough to bless me and send me away.\""

      "summary": "Juan goes to confession with Fray Hernando in the palazzo chapel. He confesses negligence regarding the Mistral disaster, saying he should have insisted on better drills and sailor training, which could have saved the 75 lost souls. Hernando distinguishes between genuine negligence and misplaced guilt, absolving Juan for this sin. Juan then raises the question of pride in his actions, particularly tomorrow's march. Through probing dialogue, Hernando challenges Juan to examine whether he seeks examination or merely validation. Juan articulates the distinction between pride and grace: pride is displaying Lucia and Catalina for personal glory, grace is sharing their gifts with others; pride is marching 600 knights to dominate, grace is letting others share in their devotion. Hernando notes Juan has 'a gift for beautiful words' - not entirely a compliment - and observes that only the walking tomorrow will reveal whether it is pride or grace. He absolves Juan for the fleet negligence with five Pater Nosters for the 75 souls.",

She heard Juan describe her as an example of \"grace vs pride\" - how does it feel to be the object lesson in someone's confession?

I suspect we will have observers.\"\n\nThe white banner of the crusade—the same banner that flew over Granada, that has been carried across half of Christendom—unfurls in the morning breeze.

Now you come having finished one, carrying another on your shoulders.\n\nThe route takes you through the Trastevere, across the Tiber, through the Campo de' Fiori where merchants setting up their stalls stop to stare. Six hundred men in white, marching in silence, the crusade banner snapping overhead. No drums. No trumpets. Only the rhythmic tread of boots on Roman cobblestones.\n\nRomans emerge from doorways, lean from windows. You hear murmuring—crociati, Castiglia, Granada. An old woman crosses herself. A boy runs alongside the column for a hundred yards before his mother drags him back.\n\nCatalina, held before you on the saddle, waves at everyone with indiscriminate enthusiasm.\n\nSt. Peter's rises before you.\n\nThe ancient basilica—Constantine's church, a thousand years old, the heart of Christendom—dominates the Vatican Hill. Scaffolding clings to portions of its facade; the building has been under perpetual renovation for decades. But the great doors stand open, and the atrium called the Paradiso spreads before them, colonnaded and vast.\n\nYour column halts in the piazza. The men maintain formation, silent, disciplined. Faces appear in the windows of the Apostolic Palace. You cannot make out features at this distance, but you feel the weight of watching eyes.\n\nA priest emerges from the basilica—elderly, dignified, wearing the vestments of a canon of St. Peter's. He approaches with measured steps.\n\n\"Your Majesty of Castile.\" He bows correctly. \"The Chapter of St. Peter welcomes you and your... companions... to Mass. If you will follow me, we have prepared space in the nave.\"\n\nHe glances at the six hundred men behind you, and something flickers across his face—not quite fear, not quite disapproval. Something more like awe carefully suppressed."

From minor positive interactions to potentially transformative encounters, the table captures the tension and hope of this carefully orchestrated religious spectacle. Catalina's presence and the disciplined crusaders create a backdrop of potential - each roll revealing a different layer of potential diplomatic maneuvering.\n\nMASS AT ST. PETER'S: D100 TABLE\n\nThe Situation: King Juan II of Castile attends Mass at St. Peter's Basilica with 591 crusader knights, his two-year-old daughter Catalina, and Fray Hernando. He has requested prayers for the 75 souls lost at sea. The Vatican is watching but has sent no one of significance. Canon Giuliano Della Rovere celebrates.\n\nSuccess Factors (pushing toward higher results)\n\nCrusaders are disciplined veterans who know how to conduct themselves\n\nThe request for prayers for the dead is unimpeachable—refusing would look petty\n\nVisual spectacle of 591 men in white is inherently powerful\n\nCatalina's presence humanizes Juan, makes this family pilgrimage not military threat\n\nRomans are watching; public sentiment matters even to the Vatican\n\nThe Mass itself is sacred ground—harder to play politics during liturgy\n\nFailure Factors (pushing toward lower results)\n\nVatican has deliberately sent no one important—a calculated snub\n\nCanon Della Rovere wants to minimize, not elevate\n\nPapal secretaries are recording everything for hostile interpretation\n\nThe mysterious Dominican observer—purpose unknown\n\nThe elderly cardinal ignoring Juan entirely—deliberate?\n\nPolitical tensions make any engagement risky for Church officials\n\nD100 TABLE: THE MASS\n\nRoll\nOutcome\n1-10\nCold Liturgy. Canon Della Rovere conducts the shortest valid Mass possible. The prayers for the dead are reduced to a single mumbled line—no mention of the sea, of knights, of Castile. The crusaders receive communion with assembly-line efficiency. When it ends, the clergy vanish into the sacristy without a word. The elderly cardinal departs through a side door without once looking at you. The message is clear: you are tolerated, not welcomed. The papal secretaries write furiously. Catalina, bored and restless, begins to fuss loudly during the consecration—Donna Francesca must take her outside.\n11-20\nPerfunctory Observance. The Mass proceeds correctly but without warmth. Della Rovere mentions \"souls lost at sea\" during the Memento—nothing more. No names, no context, no acknowledgment of who these men were or whom they served. Your knights receive communion in silence. Romans watch from the margins but do not approach afterward. The Vatican observers depart immediately when Mass ends. You have attended Mass at St. Peter's. Nothing more. Nothing less.\n21-30\nQuiet Respect, Closed Doors. Della Rovere delivers a competent homily on pilgrimage and penitence—generic, applicable to any group of travelers. The prayers for the dead are brief but dignified: \"We remember those who perished in the sea, faithful servants journeying to do God's work.\" After Mass, the canon offers you holy water and a formal blessing but declines conversation. \"I have duties, Your Majesty.\" The elderly cardinal remains in his pew, reading, until you leave.\n31-40\nRoman Murmurs. The Mass itself is unremarkable, but the common people of Rome take notice. As your knights file out into the Paradiso, a small crowd has gathered—not hostile, but curious. Whispers of \"Granada\" and \"crociati\" pass among them. An old man calls out a blessing in rough Latin. But no one from the Church approaches. The Vatican windows remain shuttered. You have impressed the street; the palace remains unmoved.\n41-50\nA Child's Moment. During the elevation of the Host, Catalina—despite all instructions—calls out \"Is that God, Papá?\" in a voice that carries through the silent nave. Laughter ripples through the Roman congregants. Even Canon Della Rovere's lips twitch. The moment passes, but something has shifted—you are no longer only the King of Castile with an army at your back. You are a father teaching his daughter about faith. The elderly cardinal glances at you for the first time. He does not smile, but his expression is less stony. After Mass, a Roman woman presses a small medal of the Virgin into Catalina's hands.\n51-60\nThe Dominican Approaches. After Mass ends, as your knights file out, the hooded Dominican who watched from near the sacristy approaches Fray Hernando—not you. They speak briefly in voices too low to hear. Fray Hernando's expression remains neutral, but when he returns to your side, he murmurs: \"A brother from Santa Maria sopra Minerva. He says there are those in the city who would speak with you privately, away from Vatican eyes. He did not say who.\" A thread to pull—but it may lead anywhere or nowhere.\n61-70\nDella Rovere's Choice. Something moves Canon Della Rovere during the liturgy. Perhaps it is the sight of 591 men kneeling in perfect unison. Perhaps it is Catalina's face during the consecration. Perhaps he simply remembers why he became a priest. His homily shifts from generic pilgrimage themes to something more pointed: the duty of Christians to defend the faith, the honor of those who sacrifice for Christ, the Church's need for faithful sons in dark times. He does not mention you by name—but everyone knows. After Mass, he clasps your hand briefly at the door. \"God go with you to Constantinople, Your Majesty. I will pray for your success.\" It is not much. But it is something.\n71-80\nThe Cardinal Speaks. The elderly cardinal—who ignored you throughout—rises after the final blessing and walks directly toward you. He is thin, austere, with eyes like winter ice. \"I am Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville,\" he says. French. A member of the Curia. \"I did not expect to find a king at morning Mass. I expected even less to find one who brought his daughter to learn her prayers.\" He studies Catalina, then you. \"I will not pretend we are friends, Your Majesty. France and Castile have different interests. But I am curious about a man who marches six hundred knights to church. We should speak. Tomorrow, perhaps. My residence is near the Pantheon.\" An opening—but with a man whose faction may oppose everything you hope to achieve.\n81-90\nUnexpected Witness. As Mass concludes, a stir passes through the clergy near the sacristy. A door opens that had been closed—a door leading toward the Apostolic Palace. A man emerges in the red of a cardinal. You recognize him: Cardinal Domenico Capranica. The papal legate who accompanied your crusade. Who witnessed Granada. Who examined the converted qadi and wept at the evidence of genuine faith. He says nothing during the departure of the faithful. But as you pass, he catches your eye and inclines his head—barely a nod, invisible to anyone not watching closely. And then he murmurs, so quietly that only you can hear: \"His Holiness is watching from the window above. He sees. Whether he understands what he sees... that is another matter.\"\n91-95\nThe People's Voice. When you emerge from St. Peter's into the Paradiso, you find that the small crowd has become a large one. Word has spread through the Trastevere and beyond: the Crusader King is at the Vatican. Hundreds of Romans fill the piazza—common people, merchants, beggars, mothers with children. As you appear, a cheer rises. Spontaneous. Unorchestrated. \"Crociati! Granada! Viva il Re!\" The papal secretaries look alarmed—this is not the controlled message the Vatican wanted. From a high window of the Apostolic Palace, a curtain twitches. Someone is watching. The people of Rome have given you something the Church would not: a public embrace. This will be harder to ignore than six hundred silent knights.\n96-100\nA Door Opens. The Mass ends. You prepare to depart. And then a messenger in papal livery appears at your side—not the secretaries who watched, but a different man, older, with the bearing of someone who serves close to power. \"Your Majesty. His Holiness Pope Eugenius IV requests the honor of your company this afternoon, at the hour of None, in the Apostolic Palace.\" No delay. No waiting. No days of diplomatic maneuvering. The hammer has struck, and instead of shattering stone, it has rung a bell. The Holy Father will see you today.\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty."

          "text": "The Dominican Approaches\n\nThe Mass proceeds.\n\nCanon Della Rovere celebrates with careful competence—neither rushed nor lingering, neither warm nor cold. His homily touches on pilgrimage, on the value of sacred journeys, on the blessings that await those who seek holy places. Generic words that could apply to any group of travelers. He does not mention Granada. He does not mention crusade. He does not mention Constantinople.\n\nDuring the Memento for the Dead, he pauses and says: \"We remember those souls who perished at sea, faithful servants on their journey to do God's work. May perpetual light shine upon them.\"\n\nIt is brief. It is dignified. It is the minimum he could do while still honoring your request.\n\nYour knights kneel and rise in perfect unison. They receive communion in silence, row by row, the distribution taking nearly half an hour. The Romans pressed against the walls watch with wide eyes—they have never seen anything quite like this. Five hundred and ninety-one men moving as one body, white tabards bright against the ancient stone.\n\nCatalina behaves better than you feared. She grows restless during the Liturgy of the Word, squirming against your armor, but Donna Francesca produces a small ribbon from somewhere and the child is distracted. During the elevation of the Host, she grows still and watches the raised bread with something like wonder. She does not call out. She does not wave. She simply watches.\n\nThe elderly cardinal in red never once looks at you. His eyes remain fixed on his book of hours throughout. When the final blessing is given, he rises and departs through a side door without acknowledgment.\n\nThe papal secretaries close their notebooks and slip away toward the Apostolic Palace.\n\nAs your knights begin to file out into the Paradiso, you notice movement near the sacristy.\n\nThe hooded Dominican—the one who watched from the shadows throughout the Mass—has moved. Not toward you. Toward Fray Hernando.\n\nThe two friars speak briefly, their voices too low to carry over the shuffle of boots and the murmur of departing worshippers. Fray Hernando's face remains neutral, revealing nothing. The Dominican keeps his hood raised, his features obscured. The conversation lasts perhaps thirty seconds.\n\nThen the Dominican turns and disappears through a door near the confessionals. Gone.\n\nFray Hernando makes his way to your side as you emerge into the morning light of the Paradiso. Catalina is demanding to know when she can wave at the Pope. The knights are reforming into column. Roman onlookers—a modest crowd, curious but not large—watch from the edges of the piazza.\n\nFray Hernando speaks quietly, for your ears alone.\n\n\"A brother from Santa Maria sopra Minerva. The Dominican house.\" His voice is carefully flat. \"He says there are those in the city who would speak with you privately. Away from Vatican eyes.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"He did not say who. He did not say why. He said only that if you are interested, you should send word to the priory. Ask for Brother Tomás de Torquemada.\"\n\nFray Hernando's expression remains unreadable.\n\n\"I know the name. He is Spanish. From Valladolid. He has served the Inquisition in Aragon.\" Another pause. \"What he is doing in Rome, or whom he represents, I cannot say.\"\n\nThe crusade banner snaps in the morning breeze above your knights. The windows of the Apostolic Palace remain shuttered."

The crowd is curious but not enthusiastic. The Vatican sends no messenger or acknowledgment. Juan tells the men to rest before the next sea voyage. In a touching moment, Juan lifts Catalina to wave at the Apostolic Palace, and someone from a third-floor window waves back. Catalina is certain the Pope waved at her personally.",

          "text": "Fray Hernando nods once. \"I will send word to the priory.\" He does not ask questions. He does not offer counsel. Whatever he thinks of this meeting, he keeps it behind his unreadable expression.\n\nHe slips away through the crowd, grey habit vanishing among the Roman onlookers.\n\nYou emerge into the Paradiso—the great colonnaded atrium before St. Peter's. The morning sun has risen above the rooftops now, casting long shadows across the worn paving stones. The air smells of incense from the basilica behind you and bread from the bakers' stalls beyond the piazza.\n\nCaptain Fernán appears at your side immediately.\n\n\"Your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Form the men. With the banner. I will address them.\"\n\nHe asks no questions. Within minutes, the column transforms into a formation—a broad rectangle facing the basilica steps where you stand. The white banner of the crusade rises at the center, held by a veteran whose name you should remember but cannot in this moment. Five hundred and ninety-one faces look up at you, weathered by sun and salt and the long road from Granada.\n\nThe Roman crowd has grown. Word spreads quickly in this city. Perhaps two hundred people now ring the edges of the piazza—merchants abandoning their stalls, servants pausing on errands, beggars hoping for coin, mothers with children on their hips. They watch in silence, uncertain what they are witnessing.\n\nAbove and behind them, the windows of the Apostolic Palace. Most remain shuttered. But here and there, a curtain has been drawn aside. Faces watch from the shadows. You cannot make out features at this distance, but you feel their attention like a weight.\n\nCatalina squirms in Donna Francesca's arms nearby. \"Is Papá going to talk loud?\" she asks.\n\nThe men wait. Rome waits. The Vatican watches."

Roman crowds (~200) watch from the edges. Vatican officials observe from shuttered windows. The speech is moderate—focused on faith, pilgrimage, the journey ahead.

Your words carry across the piazza, but what the Vatican hears is threat dressed as piety. Within the hour, word spreads through the Curia: the King of Castile lectured the Pope from his own doorstep about \"solidifying the Church,\" implying Rome has failed. The mention of Basel is taken as declaration of allegiance to the Council. By evening, you learn that Cardinal d'Estouteville—the French cardinal who ignored you—has sent dispatches to Paris describing \"Castilian intimidation tactics.\" The papal secretaries' report, you are told, uses the phrase \"armed demonstration.\" Your audience with Eugenius, when it comes, will begin from a position of Vatican suspicion.\n11-20\nCold Silence. The knights receive your words with the discipline of veterans—they listen, they nod, they disperse when dismissed. But the Roman crowd offers nothing. No cheers, no murmurs of approval. They watch as one watches a foreign army passing through—wary, silent, waiting for it to leave. The Vatican windows close, one by one, as you finish speaking. You have made your statement. Rome has declined to respond. The silence is its own message.\n21-30\nMuted Reception. Your men respond well—a rumble of \"Dios lo quiere\" rises from the ranks when you mention Constantinople. But the Roman crowd remains uncertain. A few cross themselves at the mention of the lost brothers. Most simply watch. As you dismiss the company, the piazza begins to empty. No one approaches. No doors open. You have been seen and heard. Whether you have been understood is another matter.\n31-40\nThe Men Remember. Whatever Rome thinks, your knights heard you. As the formation breaks, men cluster in small groups, speaking quietly. You catch fragments: \"...beautiful moments...\" \"...keep them in your heart...\" Veterans who have marched with you since Granada look at the basilica, at the Vatican, at the ancient stones beneath their feet, and you see them committing this to memory. Marco Tornesi approaches and simply grips your forearm, saying nothing. The men are with you. Rome remains inscrutable.\n41-50\nRoman Whispers. As the company disperses, the Roman crowd does not flee—they linger, talking among themselves. You catch words drifting across the piazza: \"Constantinople,\" \"Granada,\" \"humble king.\" An old man near the colonnade says loudly, to no one in particular, \"He speaks of faith, not politics. When did we last hear that from anyone who visited the Vatican?\" A few people laugh. It is not a triumph, but it is not rejection. The common people are curious. Whether that curiosity reaches the papal chambers is another question.\n51-60\nA Merchant's Opportunity. As the formation breaks, Roman merchants descend—not on you, but on your knights. Wine sellers, bread vendors, sellers of holy medals and pilgrim badges. The crusaders are customers, and Romans are pragmatic. In the bustle of commerce, the tension eases. Your men scatter through the piazza buying provisions, talking with locals in broken Italian and universal gesture. The martial display becomes something more ordinary: pilgrims visiting Rome, spending money, telling stories of Granada to wide-eyed shopkeepers. The Vatican watches a market day, not a military demonstration. This is perhaps better than triumph.\n61-70\nCatalina's Blessing. As you finish speaking, Catalina breaks free from Donna Francesca and toddles toward the knights. Before anyone can stop her, she has reached Giovanni Rossi—the old blacksmith, the spiritual anchor of the first crusaders—and is tugging at his white tabard. \"Did you hear Papá?\" she demands. Rossi kneels, his scarred face breaking into a smile, and the child blesses him with a solemn gesture she has clearly invented herself. Laughter ripples through the ranks—and through the Roman crowd. A woman calls out: \"La principessa benedice i crociati!\" Someone begins to applaud. The moment transforms the spectacle from military display to something human, something warm. The Vatican cannot spin a toddler blessing an old soldier as intimidation.\n71-80\nThe Priests Take Notice. Canon Della Rovere has emerged from the basilica and stands near the great doors, watching. When you finish speaking, he does not retreat inside. Instead, he approaches—not quickly, not eagerly, but deliberately. \"Your Majesty spoke of beautiful moments,\" he says. \"Of keeping them in the heart for the final breath.\" He pauses. \"These are not the words of a man who comes to threaten. I will tell others what I heard today. Whether they listen...\" He shrugs, a very Roman gesture. \"But I will tell them.\" He returns inside. A small thing—but a priest who will speak well of you is worth more than a cardinal who ignores you.\n81-90\nThe Crowd Responds. As you dismiss the company, something unexpected happens. Applause. It begins near the back of the Roman crowd—a few hands clapping, then more. Someone shouts \"Viva Granada!\" Another: \"Crociati! Crociati!\" It is not a riot of enthusiasm, but it is genuine. The common people of Rome have heard you speak of faith, of service, of wonder—and they have responded. Your knights, dispersing, find themselves surrounded by Romans wanting to touch their tabards, to ask questions about Granada, to offer wine and blessings. The papal secretaries emerge from wherever they have been watching, their expressions troubled. This was not supposed to happen. Rome was supposed to remain cold.\n91-95\nA Window Opens. As the applause dies down and your men begin to scatter, movement catches your eye. High on the Apostolic Palace, a window opens—not a curtain twitching, but a window thrown wide. A figure appears in papal white. Too distant to see clearly, but the silhouette is unmistakable. Pope Eugenius IV has come to the window to look upon you. He does not wave. He does not call out. He simply stands, watching, for a long moment. Then he withdraws. The window remains open. Every Roman in the piazza saw it. Every cardinal in the Vatican will hear of it within the hour. The Pope has acknowledged you—publicly, silently, in a way that commits him to nothing but concedes that you cannot be ignored.\n96-100\nThe Hammer Rings True. The speech ends. The crowd applauds. And then—bells. The bells of St. Peter's begin to ring, unauthorized, unscheduled. Someone in the bell tower has decided to mark this moment. Other churches take up the call—Santa Maria, the Lateran, a cascade of bronze voices spreading across Rome. Your knights stand frozen, looking up. Romans cross themselves. Catalina claps her hands with delight. This is no longer your demonstration—it has become something Rome is doing to itself. And from the Apostolic Palace, a messenger in papal livery is already pushing through the crowd toward you. Whatever you intended, whatever you hoped, you have shaken something loose. The Holy Father will see you. Soon. Today. The Vatican has decided it cannot afford to wait.\n\nRoll when ready, Your Majesty."

The knights listen in silence—the disciplined silence of men who have learned to stand and wait through long campaigns. When you speak of the lost brothers, heads bow. When you mention Constantinople, a few hands make the sign of the cross. When you dismiss them, the formation holds for a heartbeat longer than necessary, as if reluctant to break.\n\nThen Captain Fernán gives the signal, and the white rectangle dissolves into clusters of men, stretching legs, speaking quietly among themselves, looking up at the basilica and the Vatican windows with the expressions of pilgrims who have finally reached a long-sought destination.\n\nThe Roman crowd does not disperse.\n\nTwo hundred souls—perhaps more now, the edges of the piazza continuing to fill—linger in the morning light. They do not cheer. They do not jeer. They talk among themselves, voices carrying in fragments across the worn stones.\n\n\"...Constantinople, he said...\"\n\n\"...Granada, they're the ones who took Granada...\"\n\n\"...humble, did you hear? He spoke of being humble...\"\n\nNear the colonnade, an old man in a butcher's stained apron speaks loudly, addressing no one in particular and everyone at once. His voice has the carrying quality of a Roman who has spent decades shouting over market noise.\n\n\"He speaks of faith, not politics. When did we last hear that from anyone who visited the Vatican?\"\n\nA few people laugh—the knowing laughter of those who have lived their lives in the shadow of the Apostolic Palace and have learned to read its moods.\n\n\"The Spanish king talks of wonder and beautiful moments,\" the butcher continues, warming to his audience. \"The cardinals talk of annates and precedence.

Some shuttered, some with curtains slightly parted. Watching. Recording. Offering nothing.\n\nCatalina has reclaimed your hand. \"Papá talked loud,\" she observes with approval. \"Can we wave at the Pope now?\"\n\nDonna Francesca hovers nearby, ready to extract the child if necessary. The knights are beginning to drift toward the edges of the piazza, where wine sellers and bread merchants have materialized with the unerring instinct of Roman commerce.\n\nCaptain Fernán appears at your shoulder.\n\n\"The men will return to San Paolo, Your Majesty, unless you have other orders. They're in good spirits.\" He pauses. \"The Romans seem... curious. Not hostile. Not welcoming. Curious.\"\n\nHe glances toward the Apostolic Palace.\n\n\"No word from within. No messenger. No acknowledgment.\"\n\nThe morning sun climbs higher. The bells of St. Peter's remain silent. The Vatican keeps its own counsel.\n\nBut in the piazza below its windows, Romans are still talking. Still watching. Still wondering what to make of the King of Castile who marched six hundred men to church and spoke of keeping beautiful moments in the heart.\n\nWhether those whispers will rise high enough to reach papal ears—that, you cannot yet know."

Whatever comes of it... they'll remember standing in this piazza.\"\n\nHe withdraws to organize the return to San Paolo.\n\nYou lift Catalina onto your armored shoulder. She is heavier than she was a year ago—growing fast, as children do. Her small hands grip the edge of your pauldron for balance, and she looks where you point.\n\nThe Apostolic Palace rises above the piazza, its Renaissance facade warm in the morning sun. Windows in rows, some shuttered, some dark, some with curtains that may or may not conceal watching eyes.\n\n\"That one?\" Catalina asks, pointing at the building. \"The Pope lives there?\"\n\nShe considers this information with the grave seriousness of a two-year-old evaluating important facts.\n\nThen she waves.\n\nNot a tentative wave. Not a shy flutter of fingers. A full-armed, enthusiastic wave, the kind she has been practicing on everyone from Roman street vendors to Castilian knights. Her whole body gets involved, nearly unbalancing herself from your shoulder.\n\n\"Hello Pope!\" she calls out, in a voice that carries further than it should. \"Hello! We came to see you!\"\n\nA ripple of laughter passes through the nearby Romans. The old butcher grins. A woman clutches her companion's arm, delighted. Even a few of your dispersing knights turn to watch, smiles breaking through weathered faces.\n\nFor a long moment, nothing happens.\n\nThe Vatican windows remain as they were—shuttered, curtained, silent.\n\nThen—\n\nA curtain moves. Third floor, near the corner. A hand appears—pale, indistinct at this distance—and makes a small gesture. A wave? A blessing? A simple acknowledgment that a child's voice has carried across the piazza?\n\nIt lasts only a moment. Then the curtain falls back into place.\n\nCatalina bounces on your shoulder with satisfaction.\n\n\"He waved back, Papá! Did you see? The Pope waved at me!\"\n\nWhether it was the Pope, or a cardinal, or a curious secretary, you cannot say. But your daughter is certain. And in the piazza below the Vatican windows, Romans are pointing and murmuring, having seen what she saw.\n\nThe King of Castile's daughter waved at the Apostolic Palace.\n\nAnd someone waved back."

      "summary": "Juan meets Brother Tomas de Torquemada at the Dominican priory of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Torquemada (young but severe, gaunt, intense) serves the Inquisition in Aragon and wanted to assess Juan after watching the Mass. He probes Juan's handling of conversos, questioning how Juan knows Commander Martin de Alcala's (formerly Yusuf ibn Rashid) conversion is genuine after 32 years fighting Christians. Juan admits he cannot see hearts but trusts honest conversation and practical loyalty. Torquemada outlines a framework for a Granada Inquisition: documented records of every conversion, systematic observation through lay familiares, informant networks, and coordination with secular authority for punishment. He explains the graduated punishment system from Edicts of Grace through reconciliation to relaxation to the secular arm (burning at the stake for the unrepentant). He warns Juan that French agents in Rome are monitoring him, with Cardinal d'Estouteville sending dispatches to Paris and reports reaching Cardinal d'Allemand at Basel. Juan commits to installing the Inquisition in Granada upon his return but states he will not burn infidels at the stake and will find alternatives.",

A promise of honey cakes and a story about the Pope waving at her, and the child is borne away toward the palazzo, her complaints fading into the Roman morning.\n\nThe walk to Santa Maria sopra Minerva takes you through the heart of Rome.\n\nYou shed the trappings of royal procession. No knights, no banner, no formation. Just a king in armor, a Franciscan in grey, and the ancient streets of the eternal city. Captain Fernán insists on accompanying you—\"Three swords at minimum, Your Majesty, or I resign my commission\"—and so two trusted men-at-arms follow at a discreet distance, dressed plainly, weapons concealed.\n\nThe route passes the Pantheon—that vast drum of Roman engineering, now a church, its bronze doors green with age. Fray Hernando crosses himself as you pass. \"The old gods live here still,\" he murmurs. \"Sanctified, but not forgotten.\"\n\nBeyond it, a piazza opens, and there rises Santa Maria sopra Minerva. A Gothic church—rare in Rome—built literally atop the ruins of a temple to Minerva. The Dominicans have held it for two centuries.\n\nThe facade is modest. The interior, you know, is not.\n\nA young Dominican meets you at the door. He bows, says nothing, and leads you through the nave—past chapels thick with incense, past tombs of cardinals and nobles, past the blue-vaulted ceiling studded with golden stars—to a small door near the sacristy.\n\nA corridor. A staircase. A simple wooden door.\n\nThe young friar knocks twice, pauses, knocks once more.\n\n\"Enter,\" says a voice from within. Spanish. Castilian, in fact. The accent of Valladolid.\n\nThe room is small, sparse, monastic. A desk, two chairs, a crucifix on the wall. A window looks out onto a modest courtyard where herbs grow in orderly rows.\n\nBrother Tomás de Torquemada rises as you enter.\n\nHe is younger than you expected—younger than his bearing suggests. Tall, gaunt, with the hollow cheeks of a man who fasts often and seriously. His Dominican habit is immaculate but worn, the white wool greyed from many washings. His eyes are the most striking feature: dark, intense, burning with something that might be faith or might be fever.\n\nHe bows—correctly, but without flourish.\n\n\"Your Majesty. I am grateful you came.\"\n\nWhat does Torquemada want?\nHe wants influence. He wants to attach himself to power that will advance his vision of a purified Church. He sees in Juan a potential instrument—a king who has conquered for the faith, who has forced conversions, who might be shaped toward Torquemada's particular understanding of Christian duty. He wants to assess Juan, to determine if he is useful.\n\nWhat won't he say?\nWho else he has spoken to about Juan. What reports he has sent to Aragon about Castilian affairs. His true opinion of the Vatican's handling of reform. The extent of his connections within the Inquisition. What he ultimately hopes to achieve through this meeting.\n\nHe gestures to a chair.\n\n\"Please. Sit. We have much to discuss, and I am told Your Majesty's time in Rome may be brief.\"\n\nHe does not offer wine. He does not offer food. He simply waits, those dark eyes fixed upon you."

His belief that systematic investigation (inquisition) is the only reliable method. What he thinks should be done to ensure converso sincerity.\n\nTorquemada should push back on Juan's answer.

When patterns emerge, when accusations accumulate, then—and only then—formal inquiry. Conducted by men trained to distinguish true faith from performance. Men who understand that the apostate will lie, and who know how to find truth regardless.\"\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\"This is not the sword at the throat. This is the shepherd watching his flock for wolves in sheep's clothing.\"\n\nHis dark eyes hold yours.\n\n\"The Pope cannot object to a king who documents baptisms, notices irregularities, and investigates accusations of apostasy.

There are medieval papal inquisitions operating in Aragon (where Torquemada is from and serves), but Castile's inquisitorial apparatus is much weaker. The famous Spanish Inquisition won't be established until 1478.\n\nTorquemada historically became the first Grand Inquisitor of the unified Spanish Inquisition in 1483. In 1434, he would be a relatively junior figure, though clearly ambitious and already working within the Aragonese inquisition.\n\nSo his answer should reflect:\n- The reality that Castilian inquisition is underdeveloped\n- His eagerness to position himself as useful\n- His reluctance to reveal exactly what his ambitions are\n- Perhaps suggesting that the *current* Castilian inquisition is inadequate without directly criticizing it\n\nWhat does Torquemada want?\nTo position himself as the indispensable bridge between Juan and inquisitorial authority. He sees an opening—a king who is receptive, who commands newly conquered territory full of potential apostates, who is asking for help. This is exactly the opportunity he has been waiting for. He wants to be invited into Castilian affairs.\n\nWhat won't he say?\nThat the Castilian Inquisition is weak, underfunded, and poorly organized compared to Aragon's. That he has ambitions far beyond his current station. That he may already have been cultivating contacts in anticipation of exactly this conversation. How much authority he actually commands versus how much he merely desires.\n\nTorquemada's expression does not change, but something stills in him—the stillness of a hunter who sees his quarry turn toward him.\n\n\"The Castilian Inquisition.\"\n\nHe repeats the words slowly, as if considering their weight.\n\n\"It exists, Your Majesty. Bishops hold inquisitorial authority in their dioceses. Occasionally they exercise it.\" A pause. \"Occasionally.\"\n\nHe rises and moves to his desk, straightening papers that do not need straightening.\n\n\"In Aragon, the Inquisition is... more developed. More systematic. We have experience with the converso question that Castile has been spared, until now.\" He turns back to face you. \"The riots of 1391 struck both kingdoms, but Aragon learned certain lessons that Castile did not.\"\n\nHis dark eyes hold yours.\n\n\"I have contacts, yes. In Aragon. Among the Dominicans who staff the tribunals. Among those who understand that this work requires training, method, patience.\" He folds his hands. \"Whether such contacts would be useful in Castile depends upon what Your Majesty intends.\"\n\nHe lets the silence stretch.\n\n\"A bishop in Granada, newly appointed to a see that did not exist two years ago, with a flock of fresh conversos he does not know and cannot watch—what resources does he have? What experience? The Inquisition you need in Granada does not yet exist, Your Majesty.\"\n\nHe takes a step closer.\n\n\"It would need to be built.\""

          "text": "**What does Torquemada want?**\n- To establish himself as the expert Juan needs\n- To shape the Granada inquisition according to his vision\n- To gain influence and potentially authority in Castilian affairs\n- To create an institution that can systematically root out what he sees as apostasy\n\n**What won't he say?**\n- His personal ambitions (he may want to lead such an institution eventually)\n- The full extent of inquisitorial methods including torture\n- That he is essentially pitching for a job or position of influence\n- How controversial some of his views might be even within the Church\n- That an inquisition built to his specifications would be far more aggressive than anything Castile has seen\n\nI need to be historically accurate here. The medieval Inquisition in Aragon was indeed more developed than in Castile at this time (1434). The Spanish Inquisition as we know it wasn't established until 1478 under Ferdinand and Isabella, with Torquemada eventually becoming Grand Inquisitor in 1483.\n\nAt this point in history (1434), Torquemada would be a relatively young Dominican friar, perhaps with some experience in inquisitorial matters in Aragon but not yet the powerful figure he would become. He would be ambitious, zealous, and looking for opportunities.\n\nThe Aragonese Inquisition in this period:\n- Was a papal institution, meaning it operated under papal authority rather than royal\n- Had been established in the 13th century primarily to combat the Cathar heresy\n- By the 15th century focused more on conversos (Jewish converts)\n- Used a system of investigations, denunciations, trials\n- Had established procedures including periods of grace, witnesses, confession\n \nI'll craft Torquemada's response strategically, using his knowledge to subtly manipulate the conversation and position himself as an indispensable advisor. He'll carefully reveal information that hints at potential opportunities while maintaining an air of professional detachment, subtly suggesting that a more rigorous approach might be necessary in Granada.\n\nWhat does Torquemada want?\nTo present himself as the indispensable expert. To plant the seeds for an institution shaped according to his vision—systematic, thorough, independent of local bishops who might be too lenient. He wants Juan to see that building such an institution requires someone with knowledge and experience. Someone like Torquemada.\n\nWhat won't he say?\nThe full extent of inquisitorial methods. His personal ambitions. That the Aragonese Inquisition is a papal institution, not a royal one—a distinction that limits royal control. That what he envisions for Granada would be far more aggressive than anything Castile has seen. That he is, in essence, presenting his credentials for a position that does not yet exist.\n\nTorquemada settles back into his chair. His posture shifts subtly—the scholar now, the expert consulted on his field of knowledge.\n\n\"The Inquisition in Aragon operates under papal authority,\" he begins. \"Inquisitors are appointed by the Pope, or by the Inquisitor General acting in his name. They answer to Rome, not to the Crown.\"\n\nHe lets this distinction hang in the air.\n\n\"This has advantages. The inquisitor is not subject to local pressures—not the bishop who wishes to protect his flock's reputation, not the nobleman whose converso banker is too useful to lose, not the merchant guild that profits from trade with secret apostates. The inquisitor answers only to God and to the Holy See.\"\n\nHe folds his hands.\n\n\"The tribunal operates through a system of denunciations, investigations, and trials. When the Inquisition arrives in a district, it proclaims an Edict of Grace—thirty days, sometimes forty, during which apostates may confess voluntarily and receive lenient penance. This separates the sincere penitent from the hardened deceiver.\"\n\nHis voice remains measured, almost gentle.\n\n\"After the grace period, the work begins in earnest. Witnesses are called. Testimony is gathered. Patterns emerge—who attends Mass irregularly, who refuses certain foods, who observes strange customs behind closed doors. When sufficient evidence accumulates, the accused is summoned.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"The tribunal includes not merely the inquisitor but qualified theologians who examine the evidence. The accused may present a defense. Witnesses may be challenged. This is not arbitrary persecution, Your Majesty—it is legal process, more careful than most secular courts.\"\n\nHe rises again, moving to the window. The herb garden below is peaceful in the midday light.\n\n\"For Granada, you would need to build this from nothing. The structures do not exist. The trained men do not exist.\"\n\nHe turns back.\n\n\"First—a chief inquisitor for the territory. A man of experience, not a local bishop distracted by a thousand other duties. Someone who understands the particular dangers of the Islamic apostate, which differ from the Jewish apostate in important ways.\"\n\nA second point, raised on his fingers. \"Second—familiares. Lay servants of the Inquisition who live among the people, who watch and listen and report. They must be trustworthy Christians of clean blood—no converso heritage themselves.\"\n\nThird. \"Third—a network of informants. This need not be sinister, Your Majesty. Good Christians wish to report apostasy. They simply need to know that their reports will be heard, investigated, acted upon.\"\n\nFourth. \"Fourth—coordination with the secular arm. The Inquisition does not execute. It determines guilt and releases the unrepentant to secular authority for punishment. The Crown must be prepared to act upon the Inquisition's findings.\"\n\nHe lowers his hand.\n\n\"All of this takes years to build properly. But Granada is new. The conversions are fresh. If you wait too long, the apostates will learn to hide, will teach their children to hide, will create networks of deception that become impossible to penetrate.\"\n\nHis dark eyes fix on you.\n\n\"The time to plant this seed is now, Your Majesty. While the soil is still soft.\""

Torquemada has established himself as useful regarding Granada/Inquisition. Now the question is: what else does he have? Why meet \"away from Vatican eyes\"?\n\nTorquemada is a careful man. He's not going to reveal everything. But he needs to offer something more to maintain Juan's interest and to position himself as an ongoing asset.\n\nPossible angles:\n1. Intelligence about Vatican politics - who opposes Juan, who might support him\n2. Information about the French faction\n3. Warning about someone in Juan's household or circle\n4. Information about the Basel situation from a different angle\n5. His own ambitions - wanting a position, wanting Juan's sponsorship\n\nGiven that Torquemada mentioned the meeting should be \"away from Vatican eyes,\" there's clearly something politically sensitive. He's a Dominican, and Dominicans traditionally staff the Inquisition. He's in Rome \"on matters concerning his order.\"\n\nI think Torquemada should:\n1. Reveal that he has intelligence about Vatican politics\n2. Perhaps warn Juan about something or someone\n\n3. Strategically offer a glimpse of insider knowledge to intrigue Juan\n4. Carefully measure how much information to divulge without compromising his own position\n\nTorquemada understands the delicate art of political maneuvering. He'll drop a carefully selected piece of information that hints at deeper insights, creating just enough curiosity to make Juan want more. His goal is to establish himself as a valuable, ongoing source of sensitive intelligence that Juan cannot easily dismiss or ignore.\n\nWhat does Torquemada want?\nTo reveal that he is more than a religious zealot—that he is a source of intelligence, a useful asset in the treacherous waters of Vatican politics. He has already secured Juan's interest in the Inquisition for Granada. Now he wants to demonstrate additional value, to make Juan see him as indispensable in multiple ways.\n\nWhat won't he say?\nWho his sources are. The full extent of his network. Whether others in his order share his views or his interest in Juan. What he ultimately wants in return for this information.\n\nTorquemada's expression shifts almost imperceptibly. Something like satisfaction crosses his gaunt features before vanishing behind monastic composure.\n\n\"Granada is important. But no—it is not why I asked for this meeting.\"\n\nHe moves back to his chair but does not sit. His fingers rest on its back.\n\n\"I told your confessor that there are those in Rome who would speak with you away from Vatican eyes. I meant myself, yes. But I also meant to warn you.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his words.\n\n\"You come to Rome seeking audience with the Pope. You carry proposals from Como. You hope to find some middle ground between His Holiness and Basel.\" His dark eyes hold yours. \"You are not the only one watching these developments, Your Majesty. And not all who watch wish you well.\"\n\nHe circles behind the chair.\n\n\"The French have agents in Rome. Cardinal d'Estouteville dines with the French ambassador weekly. The University of Paris sends men who are not merely theologians. They watch Basel. They watch the Emperor. And now they watch you.\"\n\nHe stops.\n\n\"You marched six hundred men to St. Peter's this morning. By tonight, a report will travel north describing what you said, how you said it, how the Romans reacted. By next week, Cardinal d'Allemand in Basel will know every word.\"\n\nHis voice drops.\n\n\"And there is talk, Your Majesty, among certain circles, that the King of Castile has grown too influential. That his crusade gives him moral authority that threatens the balance of power. That he should be... managed.\"\n\nHe lets the word hang.\n\n\"I do not know what form this management might take. But I know that men are asking questions about your household. Your finances. Your conversos. Your intentions toward Aragon after Alfonso dies.\""

That the property of the condemned is confiscated, creating financial incentives for conviction. That \"reconciliation\" often involves life imprisonment or perpetual penance that destroys lives even without execution.\n\nI need to have Torquemada explain the graduated system of punishment - from penance for those who confess during the Edict of Grace, to reconciliation with penances for those who confess later, to \"relaxation to the secular arm\" (burning at the stake) for the unrepentant or relapsed. He should present this clinically, as a system of justice, while leaving the most brutal details unstated.\n\nWhat does Torquemada want?\nTo present the consequences as just, necessary, and merciful in their own way. To gauge whether Juan will flinch at harsh realities or accept them as the cost of protecting the faith. He wants Juan to understand that this system has teeth—and that those teeth are essential.\n\nWhat won't he say?\nThe specific methods of extracting confession. That property confiscation creates financial incentives that can corrupt the process. That \"relaxation to the secular arm\" is a legal fiction allowing the Church to claim it does not kill while ensuring the condemned burns. The full horror of what he describes so clinically.\n\nTorquemada pauses. His expression does not change, but something in his stillness suggests this question pleases him—a king who asks practical questions about consequences.\n\n\"That depends,\" he says, \"on the nature of their sin and the state of their soul.\"\n\nHe sits now, folding his hands with the air of a lecturer.\n\n\"First—those who confess during the Edict of Grace, before any accusation is made. These receive light penance. Prayers, fasting, perhaps a pilgrimage. They are reconciled to the Church with minimal shame. This is mercy, Your Majesty. The door held open for the sincerely repentant.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"Second—those who confess after accusation but before trial concludes. These are reconciled, but with heavier penance. Public abjuration of their error. The sanbenito—a penitential garment worn for months or years, marking them so all may know. Fines. Sometimes imprisonment. Their names recorded, their descendants marked.\"\n\nHis voice remains level.\n\n\"Third—those who refuse to confess despite evidence, or who confess but are judged insincere, or who are convicted and later relapse into apostasy.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"These are relaxed to the secular arm.\"\n\nThe phrase hangs in the sparse room.\n\n\"The Church does not kill, Your Majesty. She is a mother, and mothers do not slay their children. But when a child proves to be no child at all—a wolf that infiltrated the fold, a disease that threatens the flock—the Church must protect the faithful. She releases the unrepentant to secular authority, with a plea for mercy.\"\n\nHis expression does not flicker.\n\n\"The secular authority acts as it sees fit. In Aragon, the unrepentant burn.\"\n\nHe lets the silence stretch for three heartbeats.\n\n\"This is rare, Your Majesty. The purpose of the Inquisition is not execution—it is salvation. Every tool, every method, every procedure exists to give the apostate opportunity to repent and return to Christ. Only those who refuse every chance, who cling to their false faith unto the end, face the fire.\"\n\nHe rises.\n\n\"And even then, those who repent at the stake—truly repent, in their final moments—are granted the mercy of strangulation before the flames are lit.\""

The dark eyes. The questions about conversos, about Commander Martín, about how you know a conversion is genuine.\n\nShe sets aside the last piece of armor and moves to pour you wine. Her back is to you when you describe Torquemada's proposals—records of every conversion, observation, informants, investigation. The Inquisition that Granada does not yet have but would need to build.\n\nShe is silent when you tell her you said you would install the Inquisition upon your return.\n\nThe warnings about French agents. Cardinal d'Estouteville. Reports traveling north. Men asking questions about your household, your finances, your intentions toward Aragon.\n\nShe hands you the wine and sits across from you, her own cup cradled in her hands.\n\nFor a long moment, she says nothing. Her dark Florentine eyes study your face.\n\n\"This Dominican,\" she says finally. \"He sought you out. He had answers ready for questions you had not yet thought to ask. He told you exactly what you needed to hear about Granada's future, and then—conveniently—warned you about enemies watching.\"\n\nShe sips her wine.\n\n\"In Florence, we call this l'amo. The hook.\" Her voice is quiet. \"You bait it with something the fish wants. Then you set it with something the fish fears. And then you wait for the fish to swim exactly where you wish it to go.\"\n\nShe looks at you.\n\n\"What does Brother Tomás want, husband?

Not what he says he gains. What he actually gains.\"\n\nShe turns back to face you.\n\n\"You told him you would install the Inquisition in Granada. You told him you liked his ideas about records and observation. You listened when he warned you about French agents.\" She pauses. \"What did you offer him, Juan?

She shouldn't be overly effusive or grateful - that's not her character. She's been established as sharp, practical, and somewhat dry in her humor.\n\nWhat does Lucia want?\nA moment of normalcy. To be seen as a wife, not only as a political partner analyzing threats and conspiracies. She has spent the morning watching her husband march an army to the Vatican, wondering if his gamble would shatter everything. The oranges are small—but small things matter when everything else is vast and uncertain.\n\nWhat won't she say?\nThat she is touched he remembered at all.

She also wants to feel useful - her Camera inquiry failed, and she wants to contribute meaningfully.\n\n**What won't she say?**\nThat she's frustrated her earlier effort with the Camera produced nothing. That she's worried about her ability to help in a city where her family's connections are more limited than in Florence. That she needs rest but won't fully admit how much the pregnancy is affecting her.\n\nLet me write a response that shows Lucia engaging with the request but steering it toward her own agenda - wanting Juan to actually take a break for an hour, and perhaps asserting that she needs to rest too before planning elaborate schemes.\n\nWhat does Lucia want?\nTo be useful. Her Camera inquiry failed. She watched from a distance all morning while Juan acted. She is a Medici by blood, trained to navigate courts and politics, and she has contributed nothing of substance today. She wants to help—but she also needs rest, though she will not fully admit this.\n\nWhat won't she say?\nThat the pregnancy is exhausting her more than she shows. That she feels somewhat useless in Rome, where her family's connections are thinner than in Florence or even Milan. That she is uncertain whether Vatican figures would accept an invitation from the Castilian queen, or whether such invitations would be seen as presumptuous.\n\nLucia watches you change, her eyes tracking the familiar movements as you shed the gambeson and pull on simpler clothes.\n\n\"Invitations,\" she repeats slowly. \"From a queen who has been in Rome for two days, to cardinals and nobles who have spent years navigating Vatican politics.\"\n\nShe rises and moves to the small writing desk where her half-finished letter still sits.\n\n\"It is... not how things are done here. In Florence, yes—we would host, we would invite, we would create occasions for conversation. But Rome is different. The Vatican has its own rhythms. Cardinals do not simply come to dinner when a foreign queen asks.\"\n\nShe taps a finger against the desk, thinking.\n\n\"Casual meetings are possible. The churches, the markets, the public spaces where one might happen to encounter someone.\" A pause. \"Cardinal Capranica has not approached us. But he has also not avoided us.

They share the oranges in the afternoon light - a quiet moment of domesticity between a king and his pregnant queen, away from the weight of Vatican politics, inquisitorial designs, and crusade preparations.

Without armor, without guards, without the trappings of kingship, you are simply a man in good Spanish wool—foreign, clearly, but unremarkable.\n\nCaptain Fernán would be furious if he knew. You do not care.\n\nThe market near the Pantheon is a riot of color and noise. Vendors call their wares in rapid Italian, competing for attention. Bolts of cloth hang beside strings of garlic. A fishmonger argues with a priest over the price of sardines. Children dart between legs, chasing a spotted cat.\n\nYou find the fruit sellers in a corner of the piazza, their stalls bright with the harvest of southern Italy. Lemons from Amalfi. Figs from Calabria. And oranges—piles of them, some pale and golden, others dark as wine.\n\n\"Arancia sanguinella,\" an old woman calls, seeing you examine her wares. Blood oranges. She holds one up, her weathered hands turning it to show the deep red blush beneath the skin. \"Siciliana. La migliore.\"\n\nYou buy a dozen, perhaps more than Lucia can eat, but the old woman's smile when you pay without haggling is worth the extra coins. She wraps them in cloth and presses them into your hands with a blessing in dialect you only half understand.\n\nThe walk back is slower. You take a longer route, through narrow streets where laundry hangs between buildings and old men play cards in doorways. Rome layers itself around you—ancient stones beneath medieval walls beneath Renaissance facades. A city that has seen a hundred kings come and go.\n\nNear the palazzo, you pass a group of men talking in low voices. One of them glances at you, does a double-take, nudges his companion. You catch a fragment: \"...il re spagnolo...\" The Spanish king.\n\nWord has spread.\n\nYou walk on, oranges tucked under your arm, and let them wonder.\n\nLucia is dozing when you return, curled in her chair by the window.
