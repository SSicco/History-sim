          "text": "1. This is Chapter 29, following Chapter 28\n2. Chapter 28 concluded the Cortes at Valladolid on November 14, 1431\n3. The Cortes was a major success:\n   - Secured 5% crusade tax through December 1433\n   - Created Crown Marshal system\n   - Got noble buy-in on compensation system\n   - Condemned three resistant houses\n   - Presented vision of eternal crusade\n\n4. Isabel's situation from Chapter 23 (most recent personal interaction):\n   - 6 months pregnant in October when Juan returned from Ronda\n   - Due January/February 1432\n   - In Toledo, cared for by Dona Beatriz\n   - Very relieved when Juan returned\n   - They spent about a month together before he left for the Cortes\n   - By Chapter 28 (November 14), she would be 7-8 months pregnant\n   - She's been alone in Toledo while Juan was at the Cortes\n\n5. Current date: Mid-November 1431 (after November 14 Cortes conclusion)\n6. Isabel would now be 7-8 months pregnant, very close to due date\n\nLet me search for more specific details about the relationship and current state.\n\nPerfect! Now I have good context. Let me piece together the timeline:\n\n- October 17: Juan returned to Toledo from Ronda campaign\n- Isabel was 6 months pregnant, due late January/early February 1432\n- They spent about a month together (mid-October to mid-November)\n- Juan left for Cortes at Valladolid around November 10-12\n- Cortes concluded November 14, 1431\n- Now it's around November 16-17, 1431\n- Isabel would be approximately 7-8 months pregnant now\n\nKey relationship elements to remember:\n- They have evening prayers together in the Portuguese chapel as their anchor\n- Isabel has the carved Virgin Mary figure Juan gave her\n- She accumulated significant fear during his absence\n- She struggles with his absolute faith vs. her realistic fears\n- Their relationship has deepened through vulnerability\n- She's been alone preparing for birth while he was at Cortes\n- She's very close to her due date now\n\nThe player wants to start when Juan returns to Toledo and immediately seeks out Isabel. I should:\n1. Describe his arrival back at the Alcázar\n2. Show Isabel's current state (heavily pregnant, very close to birth)\n3. Stop when they see each other and wait for Juan's words/actions\n4. Keep it short - just the arrival scene\n\nLet me write the opening of Chapter 29.\n\nCHAPTER 29: THE RETURN HOME\n\nDate: November 16, 1431, Afternoon\nLocation: Toledo, Royal Alcázar\n\nThe white destrier's hooves clatter on Toledo's cobblestones as you ride through the gates. Seven days hard riding from Valladolid—faster than the nobles' leisurely departure, faster than the wagons carrying parchments and proclamations. The Cortes is over. The Crown Marshals are appointed. The taxation secured. Three houses condemned.\n\nAnd Isabel is eight months pregnant.\n\nThe journey north blurs in memory—pushing hard, changing horses twice, your escort exhausted but uncomplaining. Álvaro stayed behind to coordinate implementation. Don Rodrigo returned to the frontier. You came home.\n\nServants recognize your armor as you dismount in the Alcázar's courtyard. A groom rushes forward to take your horse. Palace doors open—courtiers emerging, bowing, murmuring welcomes. News of the Cortes' success has obviously preceded you.\n\nBut you barely register them.\n\nThrough the entrance, past the great hall, toward the royal apartments—and there, emerging from the corridor that leads to your chambers, is Dona Beatriz de Meneses. Isabel's lady-in-waiting sees you and her face transforms with relief.\n\n\"Your Majesty! Thank God—she's been watching from the windows all afternoon. The scouts reported your approach an hour ago and she's been—\" Beatriz catches herself, curtsies quickly. \"She's in your chambers, Your Majesty. Waiting.\"\n\nBehind Beatriz, through the open doorway, you catch a glimpse of blue fabric. Movement.\n\nThen Isabel appears in the doorway.\n\nEight months pregnant—enormously so. Her belly strains against the deep blue gown, both hands resting beneath it for support. Her face is fuller, tired shadows beneath her eyes, but those eyes lock onto you with an intensity that stops your breath.\n\nShe takes one halting step forward, then another. Dona Beatriz moves to support her elbow but Isabel barely seems to notice.\n\n\"Juan.\"\n\nJust your name. But the way she says it—relief, joy, exhaustion, fear, love—everything compressed into one word.\n\nShe's perhaps ten paces away, moving carefully, very pregnant, very close to her time. The afternoon light from the corridor windows catches her plainness and makes it almost beautiful."

The baby is due in about 6-8 weeks (late January/early February 1432). She's been terrified during his absence, as established in Chapter 23.\n\nI should not write Juan's dialogue or thoughts - only Isabel's responses and the world around them.\n\nYou close the distance quickly, armor still dusty from the road. Your hands find her shoulders—gently, carefully—and she leans into you immediately, her swollen belly pressing against your side. She's trembling slightly.\n\n\"I'm here,\" you murmur. \"Come, sit down.\"\n\nIsabel nods, letting you guide her. She gestures toward the bed rather than the chairs—\"Easier to get comfortable\"—and you help her settle against the pillows. It takes several adjustments, cushions repositioned under her back and beneath her belly, before she finds a position that doesn't make her wince.\n\nWhen she's finally comfortable, she reaches for your hand and doesn't let go.\n\n\"Three weeks,\" she says quietly. \"You've been gone three weeks. I know it's not long compared to the campaign, but Juan—\" Her voice catches. \"The baby's so close now. Every morning I wake up thinking 'what if today? What if he's not here?' And then the reports came from Valladolid about the resistant nobles, about the condemnations, and I thought—\"\n\nShe stops herself, squeezes your hand tighter. The carved Virgin Mary from August sits on the bedside table, well-worn from constant handling.\n\n\"I'm sorry. You're here now. That's what matters.\" She takes a shaky breath. \"Tell me—is it over? The Cortes? Did they... did the nobles accept everything?\"\n\nDona Beatriz quietly withdraws, closing the door behind her to give you privacy. Through the window, you can hear the distant sounds of Toledo—merchants calling, church bells ringing vespers, the ordinary life of the city continuing outside these walls.\n\nIsabel watches your face intently, waiting for your answer, one hand still gripping yours and the other resting protectively on her belly."

The baby's dropped lower this past week—the physicians say it could be any day now, or it could be three more weeks, they can't tell for certain. And I've been so frightened that you wouldn't make it back in time, that I'd be alone when—\"\n\nShe stops, swallows hard, trying to compose herself. \"I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't be like this. Queens are supposed to be strong, and I've tried, but—\"\n\nHer free hand moves to her belly as the baby shifts visibly beneath the fabric. She winces slightly at what must be an uncomfortable kick.\n\n\"I'm well enough, physically. The physicians say everything is as it should be. The baby's active—very active. Strong.\" A small, exhausted smile. \"Dona Beatriz jokes that he fights already, the way he kicks. If it's a boy.\"\n\nShe looks at you directly then, eyes red but steady. \"I'm just... I'm tired, Juan. Tired of being afraid. Tired of waiting. Tired of watching from windows wondering if you'll come home.\" She squeezes your hand again. \"But you're here now. And you promise you'll stay?\"\n\nThere's something almost childlike in the question—this sixteen-year-old girl, enormously pregnant, who's spent months accumulating fears while you've been commanding armies and negotiating with nobles."

The breastplate comes away first, then the pauldrons. Each piece of white armor—dusty from seven days of hard riding—clatters onto the nearby table.\n\nIsabel watches you, something shifting in her expression. When you struggle with one of the arm pieces, she pushes herself up slightly. \"Let me—\"\n\nHer fingers work at the buckle you can't quite reach, slower than a squire would manage but steady. The intimacy of it—her helping you remove your armor, the two of you alone in your chambers—seems to calm her. The trembling in her hands eases.\n\n\"I like this better,\" she says quietly as the vambrace comes free. \"You without the armor. Just... you.\"\n\nThe last pieces come away. You're left in the padded gambeson beneath, stained with sweat from the journey. You pull that off too, reaching for the clean shirt that's laid out.\n\nIsabel settles back against the pillows, watching you with tired eyes that hold something softer now. Not the accumulated fear. Just exhaustion and relief.\n\n\"Three weeks until Christmas,\" she says. \"Maybe the baby will come before then. Or after. The physicians truly don't know.\" She touches her belly again. \"Will you pray with me tonight? I've been keeping up our evening prayers, but it's not the same without you. The chapel—it's been lonely.\"\n\nOutside the window, the bells of Toledo's cathedral ring for vespers. The sun is beginning to set, painting the room in golden light."

          "text": "The days settle into a rhythm you've never known before—domestic, quiet, almost ordinary despite the crown you wear.\n\nEvery evening without fail, you and Isabel kneel together in the Portuguese chapel. She grows heavier, moves more slowly, but never misses the prayers. The ritual anchors both of you. Sometimes you pray the rosary in silence. Sometimes she asks you to read Scripture aloud while she rests her hands on her belly. The baby kicks during the Magnificat one evening, and Isabel laughs—the first genuine laugh you've heard from her in weeks.\n\nThe physicians visit frequently. Old Doctor Fernández, who attended your own birth, examines Isabel with careful professionalism while Dona Beatriz stands guard. \"Everything proceeds well, Your Majesty. First babies often come late. Be patient.\"\n\nPatience. You learn it in increments.\n\nDecember arrives cold and clear. Isabel can no longer walk the palace corridors without stopping to rest. Her back aches constantly. She sleeps fitfully, waking when the baby shifts position or presses against her ribs. You hold her those nights, one hand on her belly feeling the movements—elbows, knees, impossible to tell which.\n\n\"Do you think it's a boy?\" she asks one night.\n\n\"Does it matter?\"\n\n\"For the kingdom it does.\" Always practical, your Isabel. \"An heir is better than a daughter who'll need a husband.\"\n\n\"Then we'll have more children,\" you say simply. \"As many as God gives us.\"\n\nShe's quiet for a long moment. Then: \"I'm frightened of the birthing.\"\n\nYou know. She doesn't have to say it. Every woman knows the risks. You've seen the way Dona Beatriz watches her, the way the physicians exchange glances they think you don't notice.\n\n\"You'll be fine,\" you tell her. \"You're strong.\"\n\n\"I'm not, though. Not like you.\" She turns awkwardly to face you in the darkness. \"Promise me—if something goes wrong, if they have to choose—\"\n\n\"Nothing will go wrong.\"\n\n\"Juan, promise me. The baby first. The kingdom needs an heir more than it needs—\"\n\nYou kiss her to stop the words. \"Nothing will go wrong. I won't hear talk of choosing. You'll both be fine.\"\n\nShe doesn't argue, but you feel her trembling against you.\n\nChristmas arrives with its pageantry. Isabel attends Midnight Mass despite her size, sitting in a specially cushioned chair while the cathedral celebrates Christ's birth. She's radiant in candlelight, one hand on her belly throughout the liturgy.\n\nAfterward, in private: \"Next Christmas, we'll have our child with us.\"\n\n\"God willing,\" she whispers.\n\nNew Year passes. January brings bitter cold and Isabel's increasing discomfort. She's enormous now—the physicians estimate the baby weighs seven or eight pounds already. She can't sleep lying down anymore, propped up on pillows even at night. Her ankles swell. Her back never stops aching.\n\nBut she doesn't complain. Not once. She attends to her duties when she can—receiving ladies of the court, overseeing the nursery preparations, embroidering tiny gowns with shaking fingers.\n\n\"I'm ready,\" she tells you one evening in late January. \"I want to meet our baby. I want this to be over.\"\n\nYou're in your chambers, her sitting in the large chair with her feet elevated, you reading to her from the Lives of the Saints. She's been restless all day—shifting positions constantly, unable to get comfortable.\n\n\"Soon,\" you promise.\n\n\"The physicians say any day now. They said that two weeks ago.\" She grimaces, adjusting her position again. \"I feel so—\"\n\nShe stops mid-sentence. Her hand flies to her belly. Her eyes go wide.\n\nFor a long moment, nothing. Then her face shifts—pain, surprise, something else.\n\n\"Juan.\" Her voice is very calm. Very controlled. \"I think... I think you should call Dona Beatriz.\"\n\n\"What—\"\n\n\"Now, please.\" Still that eerie calm. Then she gasps slightly as her body tenses. Her hand grips the chair arm. \"The baby's coming. Call them now.\"\n\nOutside, the cathedral bells ring for compline. Inside, your wife's face goes pale as another contraction hits.\n\nThe waiting is over."

Another contraction hits and she gasps, bending forward.\n\nThe household erupts into organized chaos. Servants rush past with linens, basins of water, herbs. Doctor Fernández arrives with his leather bag, the old midwife María close behind. They examine Isabel briefly, confer in low voices.\n\n\"First babies take time, Your Majesty,\" Fernández says to you. \"This will be hours yet. Perhaps you should—\"\n\n\"He stays,\" Isabel says firmly. Then to you, quieter: \"Please.\"\n\nSo you stay.\n\nThe hours crawl past. Isabel paces when she can, grips your hand during contractions, tries to pray between them. Dona Beatriz wipes her forehead with cool cloths. The midwife María murmurs encouragement: \"Good, my lady, breathe through it, that's good...\"\n\nMidnight comes and goes. The contractions grow stronger, closer together. Isabel can no longer speak during them—just grips whatever's nearest and breathes in ragged gasps.\n\n\"It's progressing well,\" Doctor Fernández assures you both around the second hour past midnight. \"Everything as it should be.\"\n\nBut as dawn approaches, something changes.\n\nDawn - The Crisis\n\nIsabel has been laboring for eight hours when the midwife's examination makes her face go pale. She says something low to Doctor Fernández. His expression shifts.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says carefully to you. \"Perhaps you should wait outside now. We need—\"\n\n\"No.\" Isabel's voice is raw. \"He stays.\"\n\n\"My lady, I really think—\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" you demand.\n\nFernández hesitates, then: \"The baby is breech. Feet first, not head. We need to try to turn it, and it's... it's not going to be pleasant.\"\n\nIsabel's face goes white, but she nods. \"Do it.\"\n\nWhat follows is agony. The physician's hands pressing on Isabel's distended belly, trying to manipulate the baby from outside. Isabel screaming—actual screaming, not the gasps and cries from before. Dona Beatriz holding her shoulders. You holding her hand so tight you're afraid you'll break it, but she's holding yours just as hard.\n\n\"I can't turn it,\" Fernández finally says, sweat on his own brow. \"The baby won't move. It's coming feet first. We'll have to deliver it that way.\"\n\nThe midwife María's face is grim. You've heard the stories about breech births. About babies that don't survive the delivery. About mothers who hemorrhage.\n\n\"How long?\" you ask.\n\n\"However long it takes,\" Fernández says grimly. \"My lady, when the next contraction comes, you must push. Even though it will hurt worse than anything yet.\"\n\nIsabel nods, tears streaming down her face. She looks at you. \"If something happens—\"\n\n\"Nothing will happen.\"\n\n\"Juan, if they have to choose—\"\n\n\"Both of you will be fine.\"\n\nBut you don't believe it. Not anymore. Not with the way the physicians are looking at each other.\n\nMorning - The Desperate Hours\n\nThe sun rises over Toledo. Inside your chambers, Isabel has been pushing for three hours.\n\nThe baby's feet have emerged—tiny, purple, not moving. But the rest won't come. The body is stuck. Every contraction, every push, and barely any progress.\n\nIsabel is beyond exhaustion. Her face is gray, drenched in sweat. She can barely hold her eyes open between contractions. The blood—there's so much blood, soaking the linens, pooling beneath her.\n\n\"We're losing too much blood,\" the midwife María mutters to Fernández. \"If this continues—\"\n\n\"I know,\" he snaps. Then louder, to Isabel: \"My lady, the next push. You must push harder than before. We need the shoulders out NOW.\"\n\nIsabel tries. God, she tries. The sound she makes isn't even human anymore—pure animal agony as she pushes with everything left in her.\n\nSomething shifts. The baby's body emerges further—torso, arms—but the head is still inside.\n\n\"The head's stuck,\" Fernández says, and there's real fear in his voice now. \"We have seconds, maybe a minute before—\"\n\nHe doesn't finish. Doesn't need to. A baby can't survive long like this, cord compressed, unable to breathe.\n\nHis hands work inside Isabel—you can see him manipulating, trying to ease the head through. Isabel is screaming again, or maybe she's too weak to scream, maybe that's just a moan that sounds like dying.\n\n\"Come on,\" María is praying. \"Come on, come on, Blessed Mother help us—\"\n\nAnd then—\n\nThe baby slides free all at once, a rush of blood and fluid, tiny body limp and blue in the physician's hands.\n\nNot crying.\n\nNot moving.\n\nNot breathing.\n\nThe Silence\n\nDoctor Fernández works with desperate speed—clearing the baby's mouth and nose, rubbing the tiny chest, breathing into the impossibly small mouth. María has her hands on Isabel now, pressing hard on her belly, trying to stop the hemorrhaging that's gotten worse.\n\n\"Still bleeding,\" María says urgently. \"Too much, it won't stop—\"\n\n\"Keep pressure,\" Fernández orders, still working on the baby. \"Come on, breathe, breathe—\"\n\nIsabel's eyes are closed. She's gray as death, barely conscious. Blood everywhere.\n\nThe baby still isn't breathing.\n\n\"Juan,\" Isabel whispers, so quiet you almost don't hear. \"Tell them... baby first...\"\n\n\"Both of you,\" you say fiercely. \"Both.\"\n\nFernández breathes into the baby's mouth again. Rubs the chest. Again. Again.\n\nThe silence stretches impossibly long.\n\nThen—\n\nA tiny gasp. The smallest sound. The baby's chest hitches.\n\nAnother gasp.\n\nThen a weak, thin cry.\n\n\"Alive,\" Fernández breathes. \"Alive, thank God—\" He wraps the baby quickly, hands it to Dona Beatriz. \"Keep it warm. Watch the breathing.\"\n\nHe turns immediately back to Isabel. Works with María, both of them pressing, manipulating, doing something you can't see and don't understand.\n\n\"The bleeding's slowing,\" María says after an eternity. \"I think—yes. Yes, it's stopping.\"\n\nTen minutes pass. Twenty. They keep working. Cleaning. Stitching. Checking.\n\nFinally, Doctor Fernández straightens. His hands are covered in blood. His face is exhausted.\n\n\"They're both alive,\" he says simply. \"Your Majesty... they're both alive.\"\n\nAftermath\n\nIsabel lies pale and still, barely conscious. They've cleaned her, changed the linens, but she looks like she's already dead—face like wax, lips colorless, breathing so shallow you have to watch closely to see her chest move.\n\nDona Beatriz brings the baby—wrapped tightly, breathing but making small mewling sounds instead of healthy cries.\n\n\"A son,\" she says quietly. \"You have a son, Your Majesty.\"\n\nYou barely hear her. You're kneeling beside Isabel, holding her cold hand.\n\nHer eyes open slightly. \"The baby...?\"\n\n\"Alive. A boy. We have a son.\"\n\nThe smallest smile. \"Good.\" Her eyes close again. \"Tired...\"\n\n\"My lady must rest,\" Doctor Fernández says firmly. \"Both of them need rest. The baby's breathing isn't strong yet, and the Queen...\" He pauses. \"She's very weak. She lost a great deal of blood. The next few days will tell us if—\" He stops himself. \"She needs rest. Complete rest.\"\n\nYou look at your son—tiny, too still, breathing but barely. You look at your wife—alive but looking like death.\n\nBoth survived.\n\nBarely.\n\nThe bells of Toledo ring for morning Mass, celebrating the Feast of Saint Thomas Aquinas. In your chambers, two lives hang by threads.\n\nYour heir is born. Your wife lives.\n\nBut at what cost?"

          "text": "For the first day after the birth, there's cautious hope. Isabel sleeps—deep, exhausted sleep that the physicians call healing. The baby—your daughter—lies in a cradle beside the bed, tended by a wet nurse since Isabel is too weak to feed her herself.\n\nYou hold your daughter on the second day. She's impossibly tiny, wrapped in soft linens, but her eyes open and she doesn't cry. Just looks at you with dark, unfocused infant eyes. Perfect little fingers curl around your thumb.\n\n\"She's beautiful,\" Isabel whispers from the bed. Her voice is weak but present. \"Isn't she beautiful?\"\n\n\"She is.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry she's not a son.\"\n\n\"She's perfect.\" And you mean it. This tiny creature who survived what should have killed her—she's a miracle.\n\nBut on the third day, Isabel's fever begins.\n\nFebruary: The Fever\n\nIt starts subtly. Isabel complains of increased pain, more than expected. By evening she's flushed, her skin hot to the touch. Doctor Fernández examines her and his face goes grim.\n\n\"Infection,\" he says quietly to you outside the chamber. \"Common after difficult births. We'll treat it with poultices, herbs, bloodletting. But Your Majesty... the next weeks will tell.\"\n\nThe fever climbs. Isabel drifts in and out of lucidity. Sometimes she knows you, reaches for your hand. Sometimes she's delirious, calling for her mother in Portuguese, reliving the birth in fragmented nightmares.\n\nYou don't leave. A pallet is brought into the chamber for you to sleep on—when you sleep at all. Mostly you sit beside her bed, holding her hand, wiping her forehead with cool cloths when the fever spikes.\n\nThe baby thrives. It's almost cruel how healthy she is—feeding vigorously from the wet nurse, gaining weight, sleeping and waking in normal patterns. While her mother burns with fever, the infant grows stronger every day.\n\n\"What should we name her?\" you ask Isabel during one of her lucid moments.\n\nShe's quiet for a long time. \"Catalina,\" she finally whispers. \"After Saint Catherine. For... for surviving impossible things.\"\n\n\"Catalina,\" you repeat. \"It's perfect.\"\n\nA weak smile. \"When will you... present her to the court?\"\n\n\"When you can be there too.\"\n\n\"Juan, you can't wait—the kingdom needs to see the heir—\"\n\n\"She's not the heir. Not yet. We'll have sons.\" You squeeze her burning hand. \"And I'm not presenting our daughter without you there. The court can wait.\"\n\nDays blur together. The physicians try everything—poultices of honey and herbs, prayers, bloodletting. Dona Beatriz and the other ladies keep constant vigil. Messages arrive from the kingdom—business that needs attention—but Álvaro handles everything. You signed a temporary delegation of routine authority. The crusade can wait. The kingdom can wait.\n\nYour wife is dying and you will not leave her.\n\nMid-February: The Crisis Point\n\nTwo weeks after the birth, the fever peaks. Isabel is barely conscious, skin like fire, breathing shallow and rapid. Doctor Fernández pulls you aside.\n\n\"Your Majesty, you should... you should prepare yourself. And perhaps send for a priest.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"The infection has spread. Her body is fighting but—\"\n\n\"She'll survive. She's strong.\"\n\nBut even you can see she's not. She's wasting away before your eyes, this girl of sixteen who gave you a daughter at such terrible cost.\n\nThat night, you kneel in the Portuguese chapel—your chapel, yours and Isabel's—and pray with more desperation than you've ever felt. Not the formal prayers of kingship or crusade. Just raw pleading.\n\n\"Don't take her. Please. Not her. Not now.\"\n\nLate February: The Turning\n\nOn February 22nd, twenty-five days after the birth, Isabel's fever breaks.\n\nNot suddenly—no dramatic moment. Just a gradual cooling through the night. By morning her skin feels closer to normal. Her eyes open and she knows you.\n\n\"Juan?\"\n\n\"I'm here.\"\n\n\"How long...?\"\n\n\"Three and a half weeks.\"\n\nShe tries to sit up, can't. \"The baby—\"\n\n\"Thriving. Catalina is perfect. She's here—see?\" You gesture to the cradle. The wet nurse lifts the baby, brings her close so Isabel can see.\n\nCatalina has filled out in three weeks. Healthy pink skin, alert eyes, making small cooing sounds. Isabel's eyes fill with tears.\n\n\"She's so big already.\"\n\n\"Nearly nine pounds now. The wet nurse says she eats like a warrior.\"\n\nThe smallest laugh, which turns into a wince. \"Everything hurts.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nDoctor Fernández examines her that afternoon. Afterward, in private: \"The fever's broken. The crisis has passed. But Your Majesty, she's very weak. The infection... there's damage. She'll need months to recover. Possibly longer.\"\n\n\"But she'll live?\"\n\n\"God willing, yes. She'll live.\"\n\nMarch: The Long Healing\n\nIsabel improves, but painfully slowly. By early March she can sit up in bed for short periods. By mid-March she can stand with assistance, take a few shuffling steps before exhaustion forces her back to bed.\n\nThe pain is constant. The tearing from the birth, the infection—her body is healing but everything still hurts. She tries not to show it, but you see her wince with every movement, see how carefully she positions herself.\n\nYou're there for all of it. Helping her stand. Supporting her when she tries to walk. Sitting with her through the worst pain. Reading to her when she's too tired to talk.\n\nAnd caring for Catalina together, as much as Isabel's strength allows.\n\nThe baby is brought to her several times daily. Isabel can't hold her for long—too weak, too painful—but she touches her daughter's face, strokes the soft dark hair, whispers to her in Portuguese.\n\n\"She has your eyes,\" you tell Isabel.\n\n\"And your father's chin, I think. Strong.\"\n\n\"She'll need to be strong.\" A pause. \"We both will. When the court learns we have a daughter instead of a son...\"\n\nIsabel's hand finds yours. \"We have time for sons. We're both young.\"\n\nBut there's fear underneath the words. You both know what this birth cost. The idea of going through it again...\n\n\"Later,\" you say firmly. \"We'll think about that later. Right now you just need to heal.\"\n\nOne evening in mid-March, Isabel is finally strong enough to hold Catalina for more than a few minutes. She sits propped up with pillows, the baby cradled carefully in her arms. Catalina is nearly two months old now, alert and active, making sounds and grasping at things.\n\nYou sit beside them, watching. Your wife and daughter. Both alive against impossible odds.\n\n\"I thought we would both die,\" Isabel says quietly. \"During the birth, I was certain. I prayed for the baby at least to survive, but I didn't think...\" She looks down at Catalina. \"She's perfect, Juan. After everything, she's perfect.\"\n\n\"You're both miracles.\"\n\n\"I'm not. Look at me—I can barely walk. Everything hurts. I'm weak and useless—\"\n\n\"You survived childbirth that should have killed you. You're fighting an infection that kills most women. You're healing.\" You touch her face gently. \"You're the strongest person I know.\"\n\nShe leans into your hand, tears sliding down her cheeks. \"I was so frightened. I'm still frightened.\"\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"Of doing this again. Of having to give you a son. Because we need one—the kingdom needs an heir—but Juan, I don't know if I can survive another birth like that.\"\n\nYou gather her and Catalina both into your arms, carefully, mindful of her pain. \"Then we don't. Not for a long time. Not until you're strong and ready and the physicians say it's safe. The kingdom has an heir—we have Catalina. If we never have another child, she'll rule after me.\"\n\n\"A queen regnant? Without a husband to—\"\n\n\"Then we'll find her a good husband when she's grown. Or maybe we'll have sons later, when you're healed. But Isabel, I'm not losing you to get a male heir. Do you understand? You matter more.\"\n\nShe cries then—really cries, like she's been holding it in for weeks. You hold them both until she's cried herself out and Catalina has fallen asleep between you.\n\nLate March: First Steps\n\nBy the end of March—two months after the birth—Isabel can walk unassisted for short distances. The pain is still there, but manageable. She's desperately thin, her face hollow, but there's color in her cheeks again.\n\nShe insists on attending Mass for the first time, on the Feast of the Annunciation. You help her dress—she moves so carefully, like she's made of glass—and walk with her slowly to the chapel.\n\nWhen she kneels for prayer, you see the effort it costs her. But she stays for the whole Mass, praying with quiet intensity.\n\nAfterward, in your chambers: \"Thank you.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For staying. For being here. For...\" She gestures helplessly. \"Everything. I know the kingdom needs you. The crusade—\"\n\n\"Nothing was more important than being here.\"\n\n\"We should present Catalina soon. To the court. They need to see her.\"\n\n\"Are you strong enough?\"\n\nA pause. Then: \"I will be. Give me another week or two. Then we'll show them our daughter.\"\n\nShe says it with determination, but you both know the reception will be complicated. A daughter, not a son. The succession uncertain. Nobles already calculating, planning.\n\nBut that's for later. For now, you have what matters: Isabel alive. Catalina healthy. Your family intact against all odds.\n\nThe bells of Toledo ring for vespers. In your chambers, Isabel holds Catalina while you read from the Psalms. Evening prayers, like always. The rhythm that sustained you through courtship, marriage, separation, and now crisis.\n\n\"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want...\"\n\nIsabel's voice joins yours, weak but steady. Catalina makes small sounds, as if she's trying to join the prayer too.\n\nOutside, spring is coming to Castile. The crusade waits. The kingdom waits. The court waits.\n\nBut in this moment, you have everything.\n\nThe next morning, a messenger arrives from Álvaro de Luna: \"Your Majesty, the court must be informed. When will you present the princess?\""

Isabel's fever has been climbing for the past two days.

This is clearly about the situation in your chambers, not kingdom business.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says carefully. \"Doctor Fernández spoke with me this morning. He says the Queen...\" He pauses, choosing words. \"He says the infection is serious. That the next days will determine whether she recovers.\"\n\nHe stops there, watching your face. Not pushing, but the unspoken questions hang in the air: What happens if she dies? What are your plans for the succession? The court is asking.

He hasn't surrendered yet, but he's sent emissaries. Three times now. They're asking for modified terms—he's willing to pay the back taxes he owes, he says, but he wants guarantees. Safe passage for his family. Permission to retain one estate instead of total forfeiture.

His face shows concern when he sees your exhausted state, but he says nothing.\n\nDon Pedro Fernández de Velasco follows—the Count of Haro's heir, representing one of the great houses. Young, perhaps twenty-five, but carrying himself with the confidence of his lineage.\n\nDon García Fernández Manrique enters last—the Count of Castañeda, another great house representative. Older, maybe forty, with the bearing of a man who's navigated court politics successfully for decades.\n\nAll three bow deeply. They were appointed at the Cortes just three months ago—this is their first major test of the new system.\n\nDon Rodrigo speaks: \"Your Majesty, we came as quickly as we could. The Constable said you had urgent orders regarding the condemned nobles.\"\n\nThe three marshals stand before you, waiting. Behind them, Álvaro closes the chamber door for privacy.

They have not rebelled so I will grant them this. \nSotomayor is preparing for a siege. Tell him that if he does not come willingly, we will come and get him, and when we do, he cannot count on my mercy. \nYou will each get an armed escort of course.

Enough to ensure your safety and display crown authority, but not so many as to appear you're bringing an army. You carry writs bearing His Majesty's seal and the ecclesiastical notices of excommunication—the full legal authority of both crown and church.\"\n\nHe looks at each marshal in turn. \"Baron de Medina has already surrendered his estates. Don García, you'll find him at his minor holding near Burgos. He should be the easiest—he's already compliant, if bitter about it. Bring him to Toledo in honorable custody.\"\n\n\"Count of Niebla is negotiating. Don Pedro, you'll make clear there are no negotiations. The Cortes' judgment is final. He surrenders his person and comes to Toledo for trial, or he becomes an outlaw and we come for him with the full army.\"\n\n\"Don García de Sotomayor...\" Álvaro's voice hardens. \"Don Rodrigo, you'll need to be careful. His castle is fortified. You deliver His Majesty's message, but if he refuses, you withdraw. Do not attempt to force entry with fifty men—that's suicide. Report back and we'll organize a proper siege with artillery for spring.\"\n\nÁlvaro glances at you to confirm this is acceptable, then back to the marshals. \"Questions?\"\n\nDon Pedro Fernández de Velasco speaks: \"Your Majesty, if they ask about the specific charges at trial—what they face if they surrender?\"\n\nThe chamber is quiet, waiting for your response."

At that point, His Majesty's offer of potential mercy is withdrawn. We reduce their castles with the full army and they face execution, not trial.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea, who will face the most difficult assignment with Sotomayor, asks quietly: \"Your Majesty, if Sotomayor refuses—and I suspect he will—when do you want the siege organized? Early spring before the Granada campaign, or after?\"\n\nIt's a practical question. Sotomayor's castle in Extremadura is in the opposite direction from Granada.

          "text": "Álvaro hands you the sealed parchment. The wax seal bears the Portuguese royal arms - the five blue shields on white. You break it open and unfold the letter.\n\nThe script is formal, written by a royal secretary, but the words carry weight:\n\nTo Our Most Beloved Son-in-Law, Juan II, by the Grace of God King of Castile and León,\n\nWe rejoice to hear news of the birth of Our granddaughter, the Princess Catalina. God has blessed your union with fruit, and We offer prayers of thanksgiving for this gift.\n\nHowever, We have also received reports that Our beloved daughter Isabel has suffered gravely in bringing this child into the world, and that she now lies ill with fever. As a father, We confess Our heart is troubled. Isabel is Our youngest daughter, and though she is now Queen of Castile and under your care, she remains precious to Us.\n\nWe write not to interfere in the affairs of your kingdom, but as a father concerned for his child. If you would find it helpful, We would gladly send Our own royal physicians - men who attended Isabel throughout her childhood and know her constitution well. They could travel to Toledo within two weeks of receiving your word.\n\nWe also extend an offer to Queen Isabel herself: should she desire the comfort of her mother during this difficult time, the Queen of Portugal stands ready to travel to Toledo to be with her daughter. We know that in times of illness, a mother's presence can bring solace that even the best physicians cannot provide.\n\nThese offers come with no conditions and no expectations beyond a father's desire to aid his daughter in her suffering. We trust in your care of her, but if Portuguese assistance would ease her recovery, it is freely given.\n\nWe await word of Isabel's improvement with anxious hearts. Know that masses are being said daily in Lisbon for her swift recovery and for the health of the Princess Catalina.\n\nMay God keep you both in His grace,\n\nJoão, by the Grace of God King of Portugal and the Algarves\n\nWritten at Lisbon, this 3rd day of February, Year of Our Lord 1432\n\nThe letter is formal in structure but the concern is genuine. A father worried about his sixteen-year-old daughter nearly dying in childbirth in a foreign land.\n\nÁlvaro watches your face as you read. \"He's not overstepping,\" he says quietly. \"But if you accept... Portuguese physicians, the Queen of Portugal in Toledo... it could be seen as a sign that our own doctors aren't sufficient. Or it could simply be seen as family caring for family.\"\n\nHe waits to see how you'll respond."

But seeing my sweet and delicate Isabel suffer like she did during childbirth has tested me beyond anything I saw on any battlefield. Never in my life have I felt so helpless.\n\n\nShe has spoken often of her mother and although she is in no condition to speak right now, I know that having her mother by her side would be of great comfort to her. Any Portugere physicians would be greatly appreciated. We do what we can, but having her own Portugese aides by her side would be of great help.\n\n\nYour letter has reached me during this difficult time and will read it to Isabel next time she wakes. I appreciate it greatly and warms my heart. I look forward to meeting you as family, hopefully under better and less stressful circumstances.

If they leave today, it could reach Lisbon in four days. The Queen of Portugal and physicians could be here within two weeks, perhaps sooner if they ride hard.\"\n\nÁlvaro stands, holding the letter carefully. \"The court will talk about Portuguese royalty coming to Toledo. Some will say it shows weakness, that we couldn't handle our own affairs. Others will see it as proper - family caring for family in crisis.\" He meets your eyes directly. \"But Your Majesty is right. The Queen needs her mother. To hell with what the court thinks.\"\n\nIt's rare to hear Álvaro speak so bluntly, setting aside political calculation for simple human decency.\n\n\"I'll see this sent immediately. Is there anything else you need before you return to the Queen?\" He glances toward the door leading back to your chambers, where Isabel lies fevered and Isabel's ladies keep their vigil.\n\nOutside, the afternoon bells ring.

Dark hair, surprisingly thick for an infant, peeks out from the soft linen wrapping.\n\nShe's breathing perfectly - strong, steady, none of the weakness from those first terrifying hours. Her tiny fists are curled near her face, and as you watch, she makes a small sucking motion in her sleep.\n\nThe wet nurse - a woman named María from a Toledo merchant family - speaks softly: \"She fed well an hour ago, Your Majesty. Very vigorous. She's gaining weight properly - the physician checked this morning and was very pleased. Strong lungs too, when she wants something.\"\n\nAs if to prove the point, Catalina shifts slightly and makes a small sound - not quite waking, just the normal movements of infant sleep.\n\nShe looks nothing like the blue, silent creature the physician held up a week ago. She's pink, healthy, perfect. A miracle, the physicians keep saying. After such a birth, she should not be this healthy.\n\nBehind you, Isabel shifts in the bed, muttering something feverish and incomprehensible. The contrast is stark - the mother who nearly died, still fighting infection, and the daughter who emerged unscathed.\n\nThe wet nurse watches your face carefully, waiting to see if you want to hold her."
