          "text": "Chapter 34 ended with the siege of Niebla. The situation is:\n- Date: March 17, 1432 (evening)\n- Location: Niebla\n- The town and outer fortress have been captured\n- Only the inner keep remains, with Count Diego de Guzmán and about 40-50 loyal knights barricaded inside\n- The Count refused to surrender, choosing death over losing his title\n- The bombardment has created a massive breach in the main fortress wall (50 feet wide)\n- One smaller bombard has been moved into the town and positioned 80 yards from the keep entrance\n- 500-man assault force is ready (200 knights, 200 infantry, 100 crossbowmen)\n- The keep is silent - no sounds, no movement at arrow slits\n- Master of Calatrava suggested offering one final chance to surrender\n- Baron Alfonso (the Count's cousin) is hoping to save the men inside\n\nSo for Chapter 35, Juan is going to inspect the bombard that's been positioned to breach the keep gate. This is the smaller, more mobile bombard that was rolled through the breach into the town.\n\nI need to:\n1. Start the chapter\n2. Describe Juan going to see the bombard\n3. Show him the technical details of how they'll breach the keep\n4. Keep it SHORT - this is an active scene, so 2-4 paragraphs\n5. Stop when Juan would need to make a decision or respond\n\nLet me write this scene focusing on the artillery setup and the technical details, then stop to let Juan decide what to do next.\n\nThe setup from Chapter 34:\n- One bombard (the most mobile/smallest) has been moved into town\n- Positioned 80 yards from keep entrance\n- Firing platform built, protective barriers constructed\n- Assault force of 500 ready\n- Keep is silent and ominous\n\nI should describe the technical details of the gun setup, the plan for breaching, and then stop for Juan to decide what to do next (likely whether to offer final surrender or just begin bombardment).\n\nCHAPTER 35: THE KEEP\n\nDate: March 17, 1432 (Evening)\nLocation: Niebla - Within the Captured Fortress\n\nYou make your way through the rubble-choked streets of the fortress toward the main square where the bombard has been positioned. The evening light casts long shadows across broken masonry and abandoned defensive positions. Your boots crunch on scattered debris—arrows, broken timbers, bits of mortar. The town itself is eerily quiet now that the civilian evacuation is complete.\n\nMaster Gunner Pietro Calabrese stands beside his gun, supervising final preparations. The bombard is smaller than the massive siege pieces that broke the outer walls—perhaps eight feet long, bronze barrel gleaming dully in the fading light. It sits on a reinforced wooden platform forty yards back from a barricade of gabions filled with earth and stone. The gun crew has positioned mantlets for additional protection, creating a corridor through which they can work with some cover from the keep's arrow slits.\n\nPietro turns as you approach, wiping powder residue from his hands. \"Your Majesty. The gun is loaded and ready.\" He gestures toward the keep rising before you—a rectangular tower of solid stone, its gate reinforced with iron bands. \"Eighty yards. At this range, with this caliber, I estimate three shots to break through the gate itself, perhaps two more to clear enough debris for your assault troops to enter.\" He pauses, studying the silent structure. \"The keep is well-built, but not designed to withstand bombardment from this close. The gate is the weakest point—once it falls, they have nowhere to go.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava joins you at the gun position, his expression grim. \"Five hundred men ready, Your Majesty. We can storm the keep the moment the gate is breached.\" He looks up at the tower, where Count Diego's banner still flies. \"But I must tell you—a cornered madman with forty loyal knights in close quarters... even after we breach, the fighting inside will be bloody. They'll make us pay for every room, every stairwell.\" He meets your eyes. \"We could lose fifty to a hundred men taking that keep, and every defender will almost certainly die. Baron Alfonso is praying there's some way to avoid this.\""

          "text": "Pietro nods sharply. \"At once, Your Majesty.\" He turns to his crew. \"Final check! Elevation!\"\n\nThe gunners make minute adjustments to the barrel angle, sighting carefully along the bronze tube toward the keep's iron-banded gate. One man tamps the powder charge a final time. Another verifies the stone shot is properly seated. Pietro walks the length of the gun, inspecting every detail with professional precision.\n\n\"Clear the position!\" Pietro commands. The crew steps back to their protected stations behind the mantlets. Pietro takes the slow match—a length of cord smoldering at one end—and holds it ready near the touch-hole.\n\nHe glances at you one final time. You give a slight nod.\n\n\"Fire!\"\n\nThe slow match touches the priming powder. There's a sharp hiss, then the bombard erupts with a thunderous roar that echoes off the stone walls. A massive plume of white smoke billows forward as the gun leaps backward against its restraints. The sound is deafening—a physical blow to the chest.\n\nThrough the clearing smoke, you watch the stone ball's flight. It strikes the keep gate dead center with a tremendous crack. Splinters of wood explode outward. One of the iron bands tears loose and clatters to the ground. A visible crater appears in the heavy timber, perhaps two feet across and a foot deep.\n\nThe gate holds, but barely. Deep cracks radiate from the impact point. The entire structure shudders.\n\nFrom within the keep—still nothing. No shouts, no movement at the arrow slits. Just stone silence.\n\nPietro examines the damage through the dissipating smoke. \"Good hit. Two more like that and the gate comes down. Three at most.\" He begins directing his crew to reload—a process that will take about thirty minutes.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava watches the keep intently. \"They heard that. They know what's coming.\" His hand rests on his sword hilt. \"Still no response, though. Either they're preparing a defense, or...\" He doesn't finish the thought.\n\nBaron Alfonso stands nearby, his face pale. He's staring at the damaged gate where his cousin Diego waits inside."

Single combat offers were sometimes used to resolve sieges. But Diego is described as MAD - so even \"positive\" rolls might be twisted by his broken mind.\n\nLet me create a table that reflects the chaos and unpredictability while staying grounded in medieval honor culture and this specific character's psychological state.\n\nI'll create a d100 chaos table for Count Diego's response to your challenge, considering his mental state and the desperation of his situation.\n\nCOUNT DIEGO'S RESPONSE TO JUAN'S CHALLENGE\n\nd100 Chaos Roll Table\n\n1-5: COMPLETE BREAKDOWN\nThe keep remains silent for a long moment. Then screaming erupts from within—incoherent, animalistic rage. Crashes and thuds suggest Diego is destroying furniture, possibly attacking his own men. The banner is suddenly torn down from inside. Complete psychological collapse—he's lost all reason. His knights may be trying to restrain him.\n\n6-15: SUICIDAL DEFIANCE\nDiego appears at an arrow slit, face visible, screaming back: \"Come then! Break down this gate! I'll kill ten of you before I die! You'll remember the cost of humiliating a Guzmán!\" He's clearly unhinged, spittle flying. His knights shout war cries behind him—they're committed to die with him. No reasoning possible. Pure death-or-glory madness.\n\n16-25: HOSTAGE DESPERATION\nA knight appears at the battlements: \"We have Luis! And Rodrigo! And others who betrayed their lord! If you storm this keep, they die first! Back away or we start throwing bodies!\" Diego has seized the men who mutinied and is threatening to execute them as traitors. Desperate, vicious bargaining from a cornered animal.\n\n26-35: RELIGIOUS MADNESS\nDiego appears holding a crucifix, shouting biblical passages about martyrdom and standing against tyrants. \"God will judge between us! He will know I held my honor!\" His madness has taken a religious turn—he's convinced himself this is divine test. His knights are praying loudly. They believe they're martyrs now.\n\n36-45: DEFIANT SILENCE\nComplete silence from the keep. No response at all. Not acceptance, not defiance—just stone silence. Either Diego refuses to dignify the challenge with response, or his knights have gagged him. Impossible to know what's happening inside. The uncertainty is maddening.\n\n46-55: NEGOTIATION ATTEMPT (BY KNIGHTS)\nNot Diego, but one of his senior knights appears: \"Your Majesty, give us time! Our lord is... unwell. We're trying to reason with him. An hour, please. We don't want to die for madness.\" The household is fracturing—some want to live. But can they control Diego?\n\n56-65: CONDITIONAL SURRENDER OFFER\nDiego himself appears, more composed but still wild-eyed: \"I'll surrender the keep... if you swear before God I keep the COUNT title. Not the lands, not the taxes—just let me die someday as Count Diego. That's all I ask.\" His obsession with the title remains absolute. Everything else negotiable except that one thing.\n\n66-75: CHALLENGE ACCEPTED (WITH CONDITIONS)\n\"Single combat then!\" Diego shouts. \"But not with you, boy-king! Send your champion! If he wins, we surrender. If I win...\" He doesn't finish. He's found a thread of honor to cling to—trial by combat. But he won't fight the king directly (possibly seeing it as either sacrilege or beneath him).\n\n76-85: CHALLENGE ACCEPTED (DIRECTLY)\nDiego appears at the battlements in full armor. \"You want me to face you? Come then, Juan! Just you and me! Your champion against mine! Or are kings afraid to back their words with steel?\" His madness has crystallized into something coherent—single combat as the path to honorable death. His voice is almost sane now.\n\n86-92: SURRENDER WITH DIGNITY REQUEST\n\"Wait!\" Diego appears, haggard but clearer. \"You're right. It's over. I'll surrender... but let me do it properly. Let me walk out with my banner, my armor, my sword. Let me kneel as a count, not a prisoner dragged from rubble. Give me that much.\" A moment of sanity piercing the madness—he'll surrender if he can do it with ceremony.\n\n93-97: THE KNIGHTS MUTINY\nShouting erupts from within. The gate bar lifts. Knights pour out—but NOT attacking. They're dragging Diego with them, bound and struggling. \"Forgive us, Your Majesty! He's mad! We won't die for madness!\" The household has broken completely. They're surrendering their own lord to save themselves.\n\n98-100: UNEXPECTED HONOR\nDiego appears at the battlements in full armor, sword in hand. His voice is clear, almost calm: \"You're right, Your Majesty. I've lost. I chose poorly.\" He raises his sword in salute. \"I'll open the gates. We'll surrender properly, as knights should. But I ask one thing—let me keep my sword until the end. Let me die with steel in hand, not on an executioner's block.\" A moment of genuine nobility breaking through the madness.\n\nRoll your d100 to see how Count Diego responds to your challenge."

Not acceptance, not defiance—just stone silence. Either Diego refuses to dignify the challenge with response, or his knights have gagged him. Impossible to know what's happening inside. The uncertainty is maddening.\n\nThis is actually a very tense outcome. Juan has just issued a direct challenge, shouted it at the keep, and... nothing. No response. Just silence. This creates maximum uncertainty and tension. What's happening in there? Are they preparing? Did Diego lose his mind completely? Are the knights trying to restrain him? Are they preparing a final desperate sortie?\n\nI should narrate this as genuinely unsettling. The silence after such a direct challenge is almost worse than defiant shouting would be. It suggests something is very wrong inside, but you can't tell what.\n\nI need to keep this short since we're in an active scene. Show the silence, show how unsettling it is, show reactions from the commanders around Juan. Then stop and wait for Juan's next decision.\n\nYour words echo off the stone walls of the keep and die away into the evening air.\n\nSilence.\n\nNo response. No movement at the arrow slits. No voice calling back defiance or acceptance. Nothing.\n\nThe bombard crew exchanges glances. Pietro frowns, studying the keep's arrow slits for any sign of movement. The assault troops in the surrounding buildings shift uneasily—men preparing for combat can accept many things, but this silent uncertainty is worse than enemy defiance.\n\nThirty seconds pass. A minute. Still nothing from the keep. The banner doesn't move. No face appears at the battlements. The iron-banded gate with its fresh crater from the cannon shot sits closed and mute.\n\nBaron Alfonso's face grows increasingly pale. \"What are they doing in there?\" he mutters. \"Why doesn't he answer? Even rage would be something...\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava's hand tightens on his sword hilt. \"This is wrong. Either he's too mad to respond coherently, or...\" He pauses, thinking through darker possibilities. \"Or his knights have silenced him somehow. Or they're preparing something.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo moves closer to you, voice low. \"Your Majesty, men don't stay silent after a challenge like that unless something's badly wrong inside. Either complete breakdown, or they're planning a desperate move.\"\n\nPietro's crew has almost finished reloading. The gun will be ready to fire again in minutes. The assault troops remain in position, watching the keep intently, waiting for orders.\n\nThe keep offers nothing but stone and silence.\n\nWhat do you do?"

Men shift uncomfortably. The success factors exist—they know you're brave, the cause is just—but it doesn't matter right now. The silence from that keep has them spooked. \"Madmen in close quarters\" conjures images of savage, unpredictable violence. Some hands tremble on sword hilts. A few men cross themselves repeatedly. The captains bark orders to hold formation, but morale is brittle. They'll go when ordered, but reluctantly, fearfully. You can feel the dread.\n\n16-30: RELUCTANT DUTY\nGrim nods, tight jaws. Your arguments land—they understand the necessity—but no one is inspired. \"Are you with me?\" gets silence, then a few muttered \"Aye, Your Majesty\" responses that sound like men accepting an unpleasant duty. The religious framing helps slightly, but mostly they're just resigned. They know this will be bloody. They know they'll win eventually. They'd rather be anywhere else. Professional soldiers doing a terrible job because it must be done.\n\n31-45: MIXED RESOLVE\nYour speech creates visible division. Some men—particularly those who've fought beside you before—straighten up, grip weapons tighter, nod firmly. Your leadership resonates with them. But others look sick, pale. One young soldier vomits from fear. The captains are barking encouragement, trying to bolster the uncertain. It's a patchwork—some genuinely ready, some forcing themselves, some barely holding together. The unit will fight, but cohesion is questionable.\n\n46-60: PROFESSIONAL ACCEPTANCE\nSteady nods throughout the ranks. Your framing works—they see this as necessary, just, inevitable. \"We did not start this, but we will end this\" gets approving mutters. These are veterans; they've done hard things before. The fear is still there—no one is eager for close quarters fighting—but it's managed, controlled. When you ask \"Are you with me?\" you get firm \"Aye!\" responses. Not enthusiastic, but solid. They'll do their duty competently, following your lead into that keep.\n\n61-75: RISING DETERMINATION\nYour words strike home. Men stand straighter. The fear doesn't vanish—fighting madmen in stone corridors is still terrifying—but your presence makes it bearable. \"The count wants to die with his title. We shall grant him his wish\" gets some dark chuckles—gallows humor breaking tension. Veterans start encouraging younger soldiers, putting hands on shoulders. The captains look pleased. When you finish, there's a chorus of \"With you, Your Majesty! To the end!\" They're genuinely ready now.\n\n76-85: INSPIRED CONFIDENCE\nYour leadership transforms the moment. Yes, the assault will be bloody—they know it, accept it—but you're GOING WITH THEM, and that matters tremendously. \"We will end this\" becomes a rallying cry that ripples through the ranks. Men pound sword pommels against shields rhythmically. The grim task ahead is reframed as righteous execution of justice. Fear converts to focused aggression. \"ARE YOU WITH ME?\" thunders back: \"TO DEATH, YOUR MAJESTY!\" They're not just ready—they're eager to follow you.\n\n86-95: FIERCE COMMITMENT\nYour speech ignites something powerful. The success factors overwhelm the fear—your courage, the justice of the cause, the religious framing all combine explosively. Men roar approval. Veterans shout that they'd follow you into Hell itself. The younger soldiers find courage in your presence and their comrades' enthusiasm. \"Kill the count and let the killing stop\" becomes a chant. Even the grimness of the task ahead—acknowledged, accepted—becomes fuel for righteous fury. They're absolutely WITH you.\n\n96-100: LEGENDARY MOMENT\nYour words strike like divine inspiration. These men have followed you through the entire crusade, seen your courage, witnessed your mercy and your justice. Now they see their king preparing to lead them personally into the jaws of death to end a madman's defiance. It crystallizes everything they've fought for. The roar that greets your question shakes the walls. Men are weeping and shouting simultaneously. Veterans swear they'll die before they let harm reach you. This becomes a story they'll tell their grandchildren—the night their king stood with them before the keep and turned fear into fury. They would storm Hell's gates at your word.\n\nRoll your d100 to see how the troops respond to your speech."

Then the response comes like a thunderclap.\n\n\"TO DEATH, YOUR MAJESTY!\"\n\nThe roar erupts from five hundred throats simultaneously—a sound of fierce commitment that echoes off the stone walls. Men pound sword pommels against shields in rhythmic thunder. Veterans who've seen a dozen sieges straighten to full height, jaws set with grim determination. You see the transformation ripple through the ranks—fear hasn't vanished, but it's been transmuted into something harder, sharper. Focused aggression.\n\n\"Kill the count and let the killing stop!\" a captain shouts, and the phrase catches fire. Men take it up as a chant, the rhythm matching their shield-pounding. \"Kill the count! Stop the killing!\"\n\nA grizzled sergeant near you, his beard shot through with gray, grips his sword and calls out: \"We've followed you through fire, Your Majesty! We'll follow you through that damned gate and out the other side!\" Younger soldiers around him nod fiercely, drawing courage from both your presence and the veterans' enthusiasm.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava moves beside you, his eyes bright. \"Well said, Your Majesty. They're with you now—truly with you.\" He raises his voice to the troops: \"Form up! When that gate falls, we go through it like God's hammer! No hesitation, no mercy for those who chose madness over sense!\"\n\nAnother thunderous roar of approval.\n\nBaron Alfonso watches from nearby, his face conflicted—grateful for the men's courage, sick at what's coming for his cousin. But even he seems steadied by the transformation you've wrought in the troops.\n\nPietro Calabrese's crew finishes reloading. The master gunner looks to you, slow match ready. \"Second shot prepared, Your Majesty. On your command.\"\n\nThe keep remains silent. Count Diego's banner still flies.

Pietro raises the slow match.\n\n\"Fire!\"\n\nThe bombard roars. Smoke and flame blast forward. The stone ball flies true, striking the damaged gate with devastating force. The entire structure convulses. More iron bands tear free with metallic screams. A massive section of timber explodes inward—you can actually see through the gate now, a ragged hole perhaps three feet across revealing darkness beyond.\n\nThe gate sags on its hinges, held up more by the surrounding stonework than its own integrity. Deep cracks run through every plank. It won't survive another hit.\n\nFrom within the keep—finally—sound. Shouting. Men's voices raised, but the words are indistinct. Not a unified war cry. Something more chaotic. Arguing?\n\nThe Master of Calatrava's head snaps toward the sound. \"They're fighting amongst themselves in there,\" he says quietly. \"The knights are breaking.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo moves closer. \"Could be mutiny. Or Diego trying to force them to die with him. Either way, they're fracturing.\"\n\nPietro begins the reload process again. Thirty minutes until the final shot. The assault troops remain in position, weapons ready, eyes fixed on that ruined gate.\n\nThe shouting from within the keep grows louder for a moment, then abruptly cuts off. Silence again. But different now—tense, charged, like a storm about to break.\n\nBaron Alfonso stares at the keep, hands clenched. \"Please God,\" he whispers. \"Let them see sense. Let them surrender before...\"\n\nHe doesn't finish.\n\nWhat do you do while the gun reloads?"

Others stare straight ahead at the damaged keep. The chanting has stopped. Now there's just the sound of breathing, the creak of leather and mail, the occasional scrape of steel on stone as someone shifts position.\n\nThe evening light continues to fade. Shadows deepen in the square. Pietro's crew works steadily at the gun, their movements practiced and methodical. The mathematical precision of reload procedures—measure powder, load shot, tamp, prime—feels almost absurd against what's coming.\n\nYou draw your sword slowly. The blade catches the dying light—good Toledan steel, blessed by Fray Hernando before you left for this campaign. The familiar weight of it in your hand is steadying.\n\nClosing your eyes, you lower your head.\n\nAlmighty God, you pray silently, protect me in what comes. Let me see Isabel again. Let me hold Catalina. Let me be a father to my daughter and a husband to my wife. I ask this not as king, but as a man who loves them. Please, God. Bring me home to them.\n\nAround you, men are making their own prayers. You hear whispered Ave Marias, see hands moving in the sign of the cross. A young soldier near you—barely twenty—has tears on his cheeks as he prays. An older veteran rests his forehead against his sword hilt, lips moving soundlessly.\n\nGarcía stands at your right shoulder. He's not praying—his eyes are fixed on the keep, calculating. But when you open your eyes, he glances at you and gives a slight nod. Ready.\n\nPietro calls out: \"Twenty minutes, Your Majesty!\"\n\nThe shouting from within the keep has stopped completely. That charged silence continues. Whatever is happening inside those walls remains a mystery.\n\nThe wait stretches on."

Torches are lit in the square, casting flickering shadows across the assembled troops.\n\nPietro's crew works with quiet efficiency. Powder measured. Shot loaded. Ramming. Priming. Each step bringing the final moment closer.\n\n\"Ten minutes,\" Pietro calls.\n\nThe keep remains silent. No more shouting from within. No movement at the arrow slits. Just stone and darkness and that terrible waiting silence. Count Diego's banner hangs limp in the still evening air.\n\n\"Five minutes.\"\n\nMen tighten their grips. You feel García shift his weight beside you, readying himself. Throughout the formation, five hundred soldiers prepare—final prayers whispered, final breaths taken deeply.\n\n\"Gun ready, Your Majesty!\"\n\nPietro stands with the slow match, waiting. The Master of Calatrava raises his hand, ready to signal the charge. Every eye is on that ruined gate.\n\nYou nod.\n\n\"Fire!\"\n\nThe bombard roars for the third time. The stone ball strikes the gate dead center—and this time, the structure simply collapses. The remaining timbers explode inward in a shower of splinters and iron. The heavy wooden barrier that stood for decades crashes down into the keep's entrance, leaving a gaping hole perhaps twelve feet wide. Rubble and debris tumble inward. Dust billows out.\n\nWhen it clears, you can see straight into the keep's ground floor—a dark entrance hall, stone walls, shadows beyond.\n\nAnd silence. Still that unnerving silence.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava looks to you, hand on his sword. Five hundred men stand ready, every muscle coiled. The gateway stands open before you, dark and waiting."

          "text": "1-8: MASSACRE - MUTUAL SLAUGHTER\nThe entrance hall is a charnel house. Bodies everywhere—knights who killed each other in final madness. Blood pooled on stone. Diego's body among them, run through by multiple blades. His household tore itself apart—loyalists versus those wanting surrender. No survivors. Just silence and death. The madness consumed them all.\n\n9-16: TRAP - PREPARED AMBUSH\nThe entrance is deliberately clear. Then—war cries from the darkness! Knights pour from side chambers, having prepared an ambush. They're fighting for their lives now, desperate and savage. Diego's voice screaming orders from above. They chose death—but they'll make you pay the price first. Brutal close-quarters combat erupts immediately.\n\n17-25: SUICIDE PACT DISCOVERED\nYou find them in the main hall. All of them. Forty knights kneeling in prayer formation around Count Diego, who stands with drawn sword. They've chosen death together—ritual suicide rather than surrender. Diego sees you enter. \"Too late,\" he says, almost calm. Then begins executing his own men, one by one, who accept it willingly. Horror unfolds before you can stop it.\n\n26-34: HOSTAGES - DESPERATE BARGAINING\nYou're immediately confronted by knights holding blades to throats of their mutinous brothers—Luis, Rodrigo, others. Diego appears on the stairs: \"Stop! One step closer and they die! Back out and let us leave with honor, or I execute them all!\" He's cornered, vicious, using his own family as shields.\n\n35-43: ACTIVE COMBAT - LOYALISTS FIGHTING\nFighting has already begun—the keep echoes with steel on steel, screams, crashes. Knights are battling each other throughout the structure. Some trying to surrender, Diego's loyalists stopping them. Chaos on every floor. You charge into an active three-way melee—loyalists, mutineers, and now your forces. Impossible to tell friend from foe in the darkness.\n\n44-52: BARRICADED UPPER FLOORS\nGround floor is empty, abandoned. They've retreated upward and barricaded the stairs with furniture, beams, anything heavy. Diego shouts from above: \"Come then! Every step costs blood! We'll kill you on these stairs!\" They've turned the keep into a vertical deathtrap. You'll have to fight upward through chokepoints against desperate men above.\n\n53-61: SURRENDER IN PROGRESS\nYou burst in to find knights already throwing down weapons. \"We yield! We yield!\" They're trying to surrender—but Diego is screaming from the stairs, calling them traitors, trying to force them back to fighting. Some obey him, others refuse. Confused chaos—men caught between oaths to their mad lord and desire to live. Your arrival tips the balance.\n\n62-70: DIEGO ALONE - FINAL STAND\nThe entrance hall is full of his knights—sitting, disarmed, hands raised. They've already surrendered amongst themselves. At the top of the stairs stands Count Diego, alone in full armor, sword drawn. \"They're cowards. I'm not.\" His voice is steady now, almost sane. \"Come and take me, then. But I die as a count.\" One man against your army, choosing his death.\n\n71-78: Diego DEAD - KNIGHTS SURRENDERING\nYou find Diego's body at the base of the main stairs, sword still in hand—but he didn't die fighting you. His own knights killed him. A gray-haired sergeant steps forward: \"Forgive us, Your Majesty. He was going to make us die for madness. We... we couldn't.\" Bloodied knights kneel throughout the hall, grief and shame on their faces. They murdered their own lord to survive.\n\n79-86: PEACEFUL SURRENDER ACHIEVED\nThe hall is lit with torches. Knights stand in formation—weapons already laid down in neat rows. A senior knight steps forward and kneels: \"Your Majesty, we surrender the keep and Count Diego into your custody. He is... restrained upstairs. We could not let him throw away our lives.\" They've taken control and chosen life. Diego is alive, bound, defeated—but alive.\n\n87-93: DIEGO INCAPACITATED\nYou find them in the main hall—Diego on the floor, unconscious or dead (unclear), surrounded by his knights who look exhausted and grief-stricken. \"He collapsed,\" a knight explains quietly. \"The madness broke something in him. We were arguing, and he just... fell.\" Heart failure? Stroke? Divine intervention? The crisis ended not with battle but with Diego's body simply giving out.\n\n94-97: UNEXPECTED HONOR KEPT\nDiego stands alone in the center of the hall, in full armor, sword planted point-down before him, hands on the pommel. His knights are arrayed behind him, also in formation. \"Your Majesty,\" he says, voice clear and calm, \"you gave me every chance. I refused them all. I surrender now—not from fear, but because you've proven yourself worthy of respect. My men live. I'll accept your justice.\" Sanity returned at the final moment.\n\n98-100: MIRACULOUS RESOLUTION\nYou enter to find every knight kneeling in prayer. At their head—Diego, on his knees before a crucifix, weeping. \"God spoke to me,\" he says, voice breaking. \"In the silence, I heard Him. My pride was sin. My madness was sin.\" He removes his sword belt and offers it up. \"I beg forgiveness—from God, from my men, from you. I was wrong.\" Complete spiritual breakdown and genuine repentance.\n\nRoll your d100 to see what awaits inside the keep."

Describe the charge into the keep\n2. Show the chaotic scene of knights trying to surrender while Diego screams orders\n3. Show the internal conflict - some obeying Diego, others refusing\n4. Create a tense moment where Juan's presence changes the dynamic\n5. Stop at a natural point where Juan needs to decide what to do/say\n\nKeep it dramatic, historically realistic, show the confusion and desperation. This is a critical moment.\n\n\"Death to the count!\" you roar, and charge forward.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava echoes the cry. Five hundred men surge toward the breached gateway, a wave of steel and fury. You're among the first through, García and your household guard tight around you, rushing into the darkness beyond the shattered gate.\n\nYou burst into the entrance hall—and immediately nearly collide with a knight throwing down his sword.\n\nThe scene is chaos. Utter chaos.\n\nThroughout the ground floor of the keep, knights are in various states of surrender—some on their knees with hands raised, others still standing but lowering weapons, a few backing against walls with swords dropped at their feet. Perhaps twenty men trying desperately to yield.\n\nBut from the stone staircase that curves upward into darkness comes Count Diego's voice, raw and screaming:\n\n\"TRAITORS! COWARDS! PICK UP YOUR SWORDS!\"\n\nHe appears halfway up the stairs, still in armor, sword drawn and pointing down at his own men. His face is twisted with rage and something beyond rage—the madness you saw at the parley burning even hotter now. \"You swore oaths! You swore to ME! Pick up your weapons and FIGHT!\"\n\nSome of his knights—perhaps ten—stand frozen between their kneeling brothers and their screaming lord, caught in terrible indecision. One young knight actually bends toward his discarded sword, hand trembling.\n\n\"Don't!\" an older sergeant snaps at him, still kneeling. \"It's over! Let it be over!\"\n\n\"It's NEVER over until I say it's over!\" Diego descends two more steps, sword raised. \"I am your COUNT! I ORDER you to—\"\n\nHe sees you enter. Sees your troops flooding through the gateway behind you. The fierce commitment you ignited in them is visible in every face, every ready blade.\n\nFor a moment, complete silence falls. The surrendering knights freeze. The uncertain ones stand paralyzed. Diego stares at you from the stairs, sword still raised, chest heaving.\n\nThen he screams—wordless, animal rage—and points his blade at you. \"KILL HIM! Kill the king! NOW!\"\n\nThe ten uncertain knights look between you, their kneeling brothers, and their mad lord. Their faces show pure agony—torn between oaths and sanity, honor and survival.\n\nYour five hundred troops fill the entrance hall now, weapons ready, completely surrounding the scene. The surrendering knights remain on their knees, hands raised higher, desperate to show they're not fighting. The uncertain ten still haven't moved.\n\nDiego screams again: \"I COMMAND YOU! KILL—\"\n\n\"Shut up, Diego!\" It's his brother Luis, one of the kneeling knights, voice breaking. \"Please, for God's sake, just SHUT UP!\"\n\nEverything hangs in perfect, terrible balance.\n\nWhat do you do?"

The ten uncertain knights—hearing their count's war cry, bound by years of oaths—snap into action and attack. Suddenly you're in brutal melee. Your guard fights desperately to protect you. The surrendering knights scramble away in panic. Complete chaos. Heavy casualties on both sides before Diego finally falls. You take a wound. 15-20 of your men dead, all ten knights and Diego killed.\n\n6-12: PARTIAL RALLY - BLOODY MELEE\nHalf the uncertain knights break toward Diego, trying to obey. Five men charge your position while five throw down swords. Your heavy infantry crashes into them. Vicious fighting erupts in the entrance hall—too close, too chaotic. The surrendering knights are caught in the middle, some accidentally struck. Diego fights like a madman on the stairs, killing two of your soldiers before being overwhelmed. You're nearly hit by a wild swing. 8-12 of your men dead, Diego and 5 knights dead, several surrendering knights accidentally wounded in the chaos.\n\n13-20: STAIRWAY BLOODBATH\nYour heavy infantry charges the stairs toward Diego. The uncertain knights don't join him, but the narrow staircase becomes a killing ground. Diego and two loyalists who join him at the chokepoint cut down the first soldiers to reach them—armor means nothing in such close quarters. Bodies pile up on the steps. Eventually numbers win, but it's brutal. The surrendering knights below watch in horror. 6-8 of your men dead on those stairs, Diego and 2 knights dead. The victory is bloody and grim.\n\n14-27: DESPERATE LAST STAND\nDiego retreats UP the stairs as your infantry advances. Three of the uncertain knights follow him—unable to break their oaths even now. They barricade themselves on the second floor. Your men have to fight room by room. Close quarters butchery. The surrendering knights plead for it to stop. Takes twenty brutal minutes before Diego finally falls, fighting to the last. 5-7 of your men dead, Diego and 3 knights dead. The keep is painted with blood.\n\n28-38: CONFUSED MELEE\nEverything happens at once. Diego charges down. Some uncertain knights move to help him, others to stop him. Your infantry surges forward. Everyone collides in the center of the hall. Impossible to tell who's fighting whom in the chaos. Swords swinging everywhere. Men shouting contradictory orders. The surrendering knights are screaming \"STOP! STOP!\" Finally your numbers overwhelm the confusion. Diego is killed, but it's messy and chaotic. 4-6 of your men dead, Diego and 2-3 knights dead, several wounded on all sides including friendly fire incidents.\n\n39-50: FIERCE BUT CONTAINED\nYour heavy infantry pushes toward the stairs in disciplined formation. The uncertain knights step aside—they won't fight you. Diego stands alone on the stairs screaming defiance, then charges down with suicidal courage. Your soldiers meet him in a wall of steel. He fights brilliantly—wounds three men, kills one—but forty soldiers overwhelm him in seconds. The surrendering knights watch their lord die. Clean military execution. 1-2 of your men dead, Diego dead, no surrendering knights harmed.\n\n51-62: DISCIPLINED NEUTRALIZATION\nYour shout clarifies everything. The surrendering knights press themselves against walls, hands high. The uncertain knights drop their swords immediately—they won't fight their brothers or their king. Your heavy infantry forms a wedge and advances up the stairs toward Diego, shields locked. He fights alone, magnificently but uselessly. Strikes glance off shields. He's disarmed, then run through cleanly. The surrender is preserved. 0-1 of your men dead, Diego dead, surrender managed successfully.\n\n63-73: BROTHERS STOP BROTHERS\nAs Diego charges down the stairs, the surrendering knights act. Luis and two others leap UP, intercepting their own count. \"No, Diego! No more!\" They tackle him, wrestling him down. Your heavy infantry arrives to find the knights subduing their own lord. Diego is disarmed, restrained by his own men, screaming curses. The uncertain knights collapse in relief. No battle necessary. Everyone lives except dignity. 0 casualties, Diego captured alive by his own knights.\n\n74-82: SERGEANT'S INTERVENTION\nThe old sergeant who spoke earlier rises from his knees and walks calmly toward the uncertain knights. \"Lower your swords, boys. It's done.\" His voice cuts through the chaos—the voice of a veteran who's seen thirty years of war. The uncertain knights obey HIM, not Diego. Your heavy infantry advances on Diego, who stands alone on the stairs, suddenly realizing no one will follow. He could fight, but instead his sword drops. He just... breaks. Collapses sitting on the steps, weeping. 0 casualties, Diego alive but shattered.\n\n83-90: MASS SURRENDER HOLDS\nYour command to surrender is taken up by the kneeling knights: \"SURRENDER! WE SURRENDER!\" The shout echoes through the hall. The uncertain knights immediately throw down weapons and join them. Diego screams defiance, charges down the stairs—and runs straight into a wall of his own men who've shifted to block him. \"It's over, my lord,\" Luis says quietly. Your heavy infantry doesn't even need to engage. Diego is isolated, disarmed by his own household. 0 casualties, perfect surrender, Diego captured.\n\n91-96: MIRACLE OF RESTRAINT\nYour shout somehow pierces Diego's madness. He stops mid-charge on the stairs, sword raised, staring at you. For five heartbeats, silence. Then his sword clatters down the steps. \"I can't,\" he whispers. \"I can't kill Christians for pride.\" He sinks to his knees on the stairs, hands covering his face. The moment of sanity returns. Everyone—your troops, his knights—stands frozen. No one moves. No one dies. The madness simply... ends. 0 casualties, Diego surrenders himself.\n\n97-100: DIVINE INTERVENTION\nAs Diego charges down screaming and your infantry surges forward, a tremendous CRACK splits the air. A massive ceiling beam—weakened by the bombardment—breaks free and crashes down directly between Diego and your troops. Dust and debris explode through the hall. When it clears, Diego stands on his side, your troops on yours, separated by tons of timber. Diego stares at the beam, then up at the ceiling, then at his sword. He drops it. \"God has spoken,\" he says quietly. \"I yield.\" 0 casualties, miraculous separation and surrender.\n\nRoll your d100 to see what happens in this critical moment."

Juan's command clarifies the situation, the surrender is preserved, and Diego dies but without massive bloodshed. I should narrate this as a professional, disciplined military action that accomplishes the objective efficiently.\n\nJuan led from the front and his speech inspired fierce commitment, so his troops should perform with that level of discipline and effectiveness. The surrendering knights should be protected, the uncertain ones should drop weapons, and Diego should die fighting but alone.\n\nYour shout cuts through the chaos like a blade.\n\n\"SURRENDER!\"\n\nImmediately, the kneeling knights press themselves flat against the walls, hands thrust high above their heads, making themselves as small and non-threatening as possible. \"We yield! We yield!\" they cry out desperately, trying to be seen, to be spared.\n\n\"Kill the mad Count!\"\n\nThe effect is instantaneous. The ten uncertain knights—caught between their mad lord and your clear command—drop their swords. The weapons clatter on stone. They step backward, away from Diego, hands rising. They won't fight their brothers. They won't fight their king.\n\nDiego stands alone on the stairs now, completely isolated.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava barks orders: \"SHIELD WALL! UP THE STAIRS!\"\n\nYour heavy infantry moves with professional precision—none of the chaos of a wild charge. Twenty armored soldiers form a tight wedge, shields locked together, advancing up the narrow staircase in perfect formation. The fierce commitment you ignited in them now manifests as disciplined, lethal efficiency.\n\nDiego sees them coming. For a heartbeat, something like clarity crosses his face—the realization that he stands alone, that this is the end he chose.\n\nThen he screams and charges down to meet them.\n\nHe fights magnificently. His blade is a blur—strikes aimed at gaps between shields, at exposed arms, at anything vulnerable. He's no coward, whatever else he is. Years of training show in every movement. His sword rings off a shield rim, nearly finds a gap, strikes again.\n\nBut it's futile. Absolutely futile.\n\nForty more soldiers are behind that wedge. The shields don't break. His strikes glance off steel and wood. The formation doesn't even slow. They simply advance, step by methodical step, pushing him backward up the stairs through sheer mass and discipline.\n\nHe wounds one soldier—a lucky strike that finds the gap between helmet and gorget. Blood flows. The man falls back, replaced immediately by another.\n\nDiego's breathing becomes ragged. He's tiring. The formation is relentless.\n\nA shield bash knocks his sword wide. Another crashes into his chest, staggering him. He tries to recover, raises his blade—\n\nThree spears thrust forward simultaneously through gaps in the shield wall. They punch through his armor. One takes him in the chest, another in the gut, the third in his shoulder.\n\nCount Diego de Guzmán staggers backward, impaled on three spear shafts. His sword drops from nerveless fingers and clatters down the stairs. He looks down at the steel protruding from his body, then up at your soldiers.\n\n\"Still... Count...\" he gasps.\n\nThe spears withdraw. He collapses on the stairs and slides down several steps before stopping. His eyes stare at nothing. The banner of Guzmán still flies outside, but its count is dead.\n\nThe entire engagement took perhaps thirty seconds.\n\nSilence falls in the keep. Your soldiers hold position, shields still locked, ready for further resistance. But there is none. The surrendered knights remain pressed against the walls, hands high, not moving. The uncertain ten stand frozen, staring at their dead lord.\n\nYour one wounded soldier is being helped back by his comrades—the neck wound looks messy but not fatal.\n\nBaron Alfonso pushes through your troops, sees his cousin's body on the stairs, and closes his eyes. His lips move in silent prayer.\n\nThe keep is yours. The siege is over.\n\nWhat do you do?"

The evening light streaming through arrow slits catches the dust still hanging in the air, turning it golden.\n\nThe surrendered knights—still pressed against the walls—slowly lower their hands. Several are weeping openly. Luis de Guzmán, Diego's brother, sinks to his knees and crosses himself. \"Thank you, Your Majesty,\" he manages, voice breaking. \"Thank you for... for seeing us as more than our lord's madness.\"\n\nThe old sergeant who spoke earlier straightens from where he'd been kneeling. \"We'll remember this mercy, Your Majesty. You gave him every chance. Every one. And you've given us life when we deserved nothing.\"\n\nYour soldiers begin the grim work of securing the keep. The Master of Calatrava issues quiet orders—collect weapons, post guards, establish control. The professional efficiency of victory without triumph. Men move through the rooms methodically, finding a handful more knights in upper chambers who surrender immediately when they learn Diego is dead.\n\nYou step past Diego's body on the stairs—someone has already closed his eyes—and make your way to where your wounded soldier sits against the wall. He's young, perhaps twenty-two, and very pale. A field surgeon is working on the neck wound, pressing cloth against it to staunch the bleeding.\n\nThe soldier sees you approach and tries to straighten. \"Your Majesty, I—\"\n\n\"Be still,\" you say gently, kneeling beside him. The wound is ugly—a deep cut where Diego's blade found the gap between helmet and gorget—but the surgeon's practiced hands are already binding it. \"How bad?\" you ask the surgeon quietly.\n\n\"Missed the great vessels, Your Majesty. He'll live, though he'll have a magnificent scar.\" The surgeon ties off the bandage. \"Keep it clean, rest, and thank God and your armor.\"\n\nYou rest a hand on the young soldier's shoulder. \"You held the line. You did your duty. Rest now.\"\n\nThe soldier's eyes shine with tears—whether from pain or pride, you're not certain. \"For you, Your Majesty. Always.\"\n\nAs full darkness falls, torches are lit throughout the fortress. Diego's body is carried to the chapel—a small stone chamber in the keep's second floor. The surrendered knights are allowed to prepare him for burial, washing the blood from his armor, laying him out with dignity. His sword is placed on his chest, his hands folded over it.\n\nBaron Alfonso stands vigil beside his cousin, face carved from stone. \"He was a good man once,\" he says quietly when you join him. \"Before pride ate him alive. Thank you for letting us bury him properly. For remembering the man he was, not just what he became.\"\n\nThe burial is done by torchlight in the fortress courtyard, beneath the stars. Fray Hernando—who arrived with the main army—speaks the prayers, though Diego died excommunicated. \"God judges the heart,\" the friar says. \"We commit this soul to His mercy, knowing pride is sin we all battle.\"\n\nThe surrendered knights stand in formation, heads bowed. Your soldiers watch respectfully. Even in death, even after everything, there's dignity here.\n\nDiego de Guzmán is laid in the fortress chapel's crypt, beneath stone that will remember him as count, even if history will not.\n\nBy midnight, the keep is fully secured. The town of Niebla is quiet—the evacuated civilians will be allowed to return in the morning. Don Rodrigo reports that all forty-three knights have formally surrendered and sworn oaths to accept your judgment. No further resistance anywhere in the fortress.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava finds you in the commandeered lord's chamber, reviewing maps. \"The rebellion is finished, Your Majesty. Baron de Medina's estate fell to Don Íñigo's forces three days ago—he surrendered without fight when he saw the artillery. Don García de Sotomayor arrives in Toledo tomorrow under escort. And now this.\" He gestures toward the keep around you. \"All three rebels dealt with. Castile is yours again, completely.\"\n\nThe campaign against the rebel nobles is over. The fortresses are taken. The defiance is broken.\n\nOutside, the night is cool and clear. Tomorrow you can turn your attention fully to Granada once more.\n\nWhat do you do?"

But sound.\" He taps the captured fortresses. \"Sanlúcar and Niebla both need garrisons, yes. Three hundred men each should hold them—the fortifications are strong, and with the surrounding territories subdued, we're not expecting major counterattacks. That still leaves us nearly seven thousand troops for the main campaign.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo joins the conversation, arms crossed. \"The Sultan withdrawing everything to Granada...\" He pauses, considering. \"It could mean willingness to negotiate. Or it could mean he's concentrating his forces for a desperate defense of the capital itself. Hard to know which until we're at the walls.\"\n\n\"Either way,\" the Master continues, \"we should move quickly. If he IS willing to surrender, we want to reach him before his resolve hardens. If he's preparing for siege, we want to arrive before his defenses are fully ready.\" He looks at you directly. \"How long do we give the men to rest after this? March tomorrow means they fight a siege, travel four days through hostile territory, then immediately begin another campaign.\"\n\nBaron Alfonso, still pale from his cousin's death but present for the council, adds quietly: \"The western fortresses are secure now. My men at Sanlúcar, the garrison here at Niebla—they'll hold. You're free to move east without worrying about rebellion behind you.\"\n\nOutside, your army is settling in for the night. The men don't yet know they'll be marching for Granada at dawn. Seven thousand troops, five bombards, and the hope that perhaps—just perhaps—the Sultan will see reason when faced with overwhelming force and generous terms.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava waits for your final decision on timing and organization."

Fresh the professionals, garrison with the tired levies. I'll have the orders issued immediately.\"\n\nHe begins dictating to waiting scribes: \"Riders to Málaga, Ronda, Marbella, Antequera, Vélez-Málaga—every position we hold. Military Order garrisons and crown professionals to assemble and march to join the main army. Route of march to be coordinated for junction outside Granada. Levy replacements to be dispatched from our current forces as we pass each position.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo calculates aloud: \"We've got roughly six thousand professional troops in winter quarters across the western conquests. If we collect them as we march east...\" He traces the route on the map. \"Four days to reach the Granada region, stopping at each fortress to swap garrisons. By the time we reach the capital, we'll have twelve to thirteen thousand troops—nearly all professionals, crusaders, and Military Order knights. Plus the five bombards.\"\n\n\"Against how many?\" you ask.\n\n\"Intelligence suggests Sultan Yusuf has perhaps eight to ten thousand troops remaining, all concentrated in and around Granada city. If he truly has abandoned the outer fortresses...\" Don Rodrigo pauses. \"Your Majesty, this could be decisive. Either he surrenders when he sees our strength, or we have the numbers to invest the city properly.\"\n\nBaron Alfonso adds: \"And if he's willing to negotiate, arriving with overwhelming force gives you the position to offer generous terms from strength, not desperation.\"\n\nWithin the hour, riders gallop out from Niebla in all directions—east to Málaga, north to Ronda, south to Marbella. Each carries identical orders: prepare to march, join the king's army, the final campaign begins now.\n\nThroughout the captured fortress, word spreads among your troops. The reaction is mixed—exhaustion from men who just fought a siege, but also eagerness to finish what was started last year. The fierce commitment you ignited before storming the keep hasn't faded. These men want Granada.\n\nA captain approaches as you review the final preparations. \"Your Majesty, the men are asking—when we reach Granada, do we offer terms first or begin bombardment?\"\n\nIt's a fair question.

The roll determines HOW the speech lands and how the factors play out in the conversation/reaction.\n\nI'll evaluate the success and failure factors of your speech, then create a custom d100 table for how it lands with the troops.\n\nJUAN'S SPEECH - FINAL CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nAnalysis of Success and Failure Factors\n\nSuccess Factors (exist regardless of roll):\n\nFresh victory: Just succeeded at Niebla, momentum is real\n\nHistorical moment: \"End of the Reconquista\" is powerfully motivating\n\nReligious purpose: \"Soldiers of Christ\" resonates with crusaders\n\nClear objective: Granada itself—the ultimate prize\n\nInevitable victory: Men believe they'll win\n\nMercy reputation: Your pattern of offering terms is established and respected\n\nRecent inspiration: The fierce commitment from storming the keep (rolled 86) still burns\n\nRealistic honesty: Not promising easy surrender, acknowledging uncertainty\n\nFailure Factors (exist regardless of roll):\n\nExhaustion: Just fought a siege, now marching tomorrow with no rest\n\nWar weariness: Months of campaigning taking toll\n\nGrim precedent: Mad count chose death—what if Granada does too?\n\nUncertainty: \"I cannot sway hearts\" means this might be another bloody siege\n\nComfort abandoned: Professional troops being pulled from winter quarters\n\nLong campaign ahead: This could take months if Granada resists\n\nMemory of 1431: Granada fighting was brutal—men remember\n\nImmediate departure: No celebration, no rest, just march at dawn\n\nD100 TABLE: HOW THE SPEECH LANDS\n\n1-10: EXHAUSTION DOMINATES\nYour words are heard, but men's faces remain tired, drawn. The success factors exist—they know it's a historic moment, they trust your mercy—but right now they're just exhausted. Marching tomorrow? Groans ripple through the ranks. Some men slump where they stand. \"End of Reconquista\" should inspire, but instead they're calculating how many more weeks of fighting that means. A few mutter about wanting to see families. Captains bark orders to maintain discipline, but morale is brittle. They'll march because ordered, but reluctantly.\n\n11-20: GRIM RESIGNATION\nSilent nods, tight jaws. Your comparison to the mad count lands badly—it makes them think Granada WILL fight to the death like Diego did. \"Inevitable victory\" is acknowledged, but at what cost? Men cross themselves, thinking of bloody room-to-room fighting in Granada's streets. The religious framing helps somewhat, but mostly they're just resigned. This is duty, nothing more. They'll do it because they're soldiers and you're their king, but there's no fire here. Just grim acceptance of more bloodshed ahead.\n\n12-30: WAR-WEARY ACCEPTANCE\nMixed reactions throughout the ranks. Some straighten up at \"end of Reconquista\"—that does mean something. Others look sick at the thought of more fighting. Veterans seem steadier than younger troops. Your honesty about uncertainty is respected, but it also means they're preparing mentally for months of siege. No enthusiasm, but no mutiny either. Professional acceptance. They've come this far, they'll finish it. Captains are working hard to keep spirits up. It's uneven—some ready, some forcing themselves.\n\n31-45: STEADY PROFESSIONALISM\nAttentive faces, serious nods. Your speech lands as realistic assessment, not inspiration—and that's actually okay with these veterans. They appreciate the honesty. \"We march tomorrow\" gets acknowledgment rather than complaint. The religious framing resonates with crusaders specifically. The comparison to the mad count makes sense to them—Granada IS in a hopeless position. They're not excited, but they're solid. When you finish, there's respectful silence, then quiet preparation for tomorrow. Competent soldiers accepting the mission.\n\n46-60: RISING DETERMINATION\nYour words begin to kindle something. \"End of Reconquista\" creates a stir—men realize they're part of something historic. Veterans start encouraging younger soldiers: \"We finish this now, we'll tell our grandchildren we were there.\" The exhaustion is still real, but purpose is emerging. \"Soldiers of Christ\" gets nods, men gripping crucifixes. When you finish, there's no wild cheering, but there's a growing sense of commitment. They're tired, yes—but they'll march, and they'll fight well.\n\n61-75: INSPIRED COMMITMENT\nThe speech transforms the mood. Your honesty about uncertainty actually strengthens trust—they know you're not lying to them. \"Tomorrow we march for victory\" gets approving shouts. The historical moment sinks in: they're the generation that ends eight centuries of war. Veterans pound younger men on shoulders: \"You want to miss THIS?\" The fierce commitment from earlier reignites. Yes, they're tired—but this is Granada itself. The ultimate prize. When you finish: \"For the Cross! For Castile! For the King!\" They're genuinely ready.\n\n76-85: POWERFUL MOMENTUM\nYour words strike like hammer on anvil. The parallel to the mad count crystallizes everything—hopeless resistance ends in death, but you ALWAYS offer terms first. That combination of mercy and strength is exactly what they've learned to trust in you. \"End of Reconquista\" creates genuine excitement—this is their moment in history. Even exhausted men straighten up. The religious framing resonates deeply. \"We are the soldiers of Christ\" becomes a chant. They're not just ready—they're eager. March tomorrow? Good. Let's finish this.\n\n86-93: FIERCE ENTHUSIASM\nYour speech ignites something powerful. Men are shouting approval before you finish. \"GRANADA! GRANADA!\" becomes a rhythmic chant. The exhaustion doesn't disappear, but it's overwhelmed by purpose and momentum. Veterans are embracing younger soldiers, all talking about being there when the last Muslim stronghold falls. Your prayer that Sultan sees reason resonates—they WANT mercy to work, but they're ready if it doesn't. The fierce commitment from storming the keep combines with historic purpose. They'd march tonight if you ordered it.\n\n94-97: LEGENDARY INSPIRATION\nYour words create a moment these men will remember forever. \"End of Reconquista\" hits them like divine revelation—they're not just soldiers, they're completing eight hundred years of history. Men are weeping and cheering simultaneously. The comparison to the mad count and your offer of mercy shows them who they're fighting for—a king who seeks righteousness, not just conquest. When you finish, the roar shakes the fortress walls. \"We march for Christ and Castile!\" No exhaustion can touch this. They're transcendent.\n\n98-100: DIVINE PURPOSE REVEALED\nSomething extraordinary happens. As you speak, the moon breaks through clouds, illuminating the assembled troops in silver light. \"End of Reconquista\" strikes them as prophetic—God's will being fulfilled through them. Men fall to their knees in prayer, others raise weapons to heaven. Your prayer for the Sultan's wisdom becomes their prayer too. The entire army seems to move as one body with one purpose. Veterans later say they felt the Holy Spirit move through the ranks. This becomes a story told for generations—the night before Granada, when the king spoke and God answered.\n\nRoll your d100 to see how the troops receive your speech."

          "text": "Your words echo across the courtyard, carried by torchlight and the cool night air. The assembled troops listen—perhaps three hundred men gathered close enough to hear clearly, with more straining from the edges.\n\nThe reaction is... uneven.\n\nSome men straighten up when you speak of finishing the Reconquista. A few veterans nod seriously, recognizing the historical weight. But many faces remain drawn, tired. When you mention marching tomorrow, you see shoulders slump. A quiet groan ripples through part of the formation—quickly stifled, but there nonetheless.\n\nThe comparison to the mad count lands awkwardly. You meant it to show Granada's hopelessness, but several men exchange glances that suggest they're thinking: What if Granada chooses death like Diego did? What if this means months of bloody fighting?\n\n\"Soldiers of Christ\" gets respectful nods from the sworn crusaders and Military Order knights. The religious framing resonates with them, at least. They grip their crucifixes, cross themselves. But the regular levies—men who've been campaigning for months—just look tired.\n\nWhen you finish, there's no roar of approval. Instead, a respectful silence. Then a veteran sergeant near the front raises his fist and calls out: \"For Castile and the King!\" His voice is steady, professional.\n\nOthers take up the cry, but it's dutiful rather than passionate. \"For Castile! For the King!\" The sound builds somewhat, captains encouraging their men, but it never becomes the thunderous response you've heard before. It's the sound of soldiers accepting orders, not warriors eager for battle.\n\nAs the assembly breaks up, you hear fragments of conversation:\n\n\"Granada. Finally.\"\n\"How long you think that siege will take?\"\n\"Months, probably. Maybe till autumn.\"\n\"Christ. I haven't seen my family since November...\"\n\nA captain approaches, saluting. \"They'll march, Your Majesty. They're good men—they'll do their duty.\" He pauses, choosing words carefully. \"But they're tired. Very tired. If the Sultan doesn't surrender quickly...\" He doesn't finish the thought.\n\nDon Rodrigo joins you as the men disperse to prepare for tomorrow. \"They'll fight, Your Majesty. But the fire's not there tonight. Too much campaigning, too little rest.\" He watches the troops trudging back to their quarters. \"Once we're on the march, once they see Granada's walls, maybe the purpose will reignite. But tonight?\" He shakes his head. \"Tonight they're just exhausted soldiers being told to do one more impossible thing.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava is more pragmatic: \"Doesn't matter if they're enthusiastic or not. Matters if they're effective. And they will be—they're professionals. We've got what we need to march at dawn.\"\n\nThe fortress settles into uneasy rest. Tomorrow, seven thousand war-weary troops will begin the march toward Granada, collecting garrisons as they go, building toward the final confrontation.\n\nOutside your commandeered chamber, sentries change watch. The night is quiet except for the sound of men preparing equipment, sharpening blades, checking armor—the mechanical preparations of soldiers who will march because that's what soldiers do.\n\nWhat do you do for the remainder of the night?"

          "text": "Don Rodrigo's expression brightens immediately. \"Yes, Your Majesty. That would help considerably.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava nods agreement. \"Smart thinking. We're swapping tired levies for fresh professionals anyway—let the men choose which category they fall into. Those who've had enough can garrison. Those who want to finish this can march.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo elaborates: \"We pass Málaga, Antequera, Ronda, Vélez-Málaga on the route east. Each needs three to four hundred garrison troops. That's fifteen hundred positions available. If a man is truly spent—physically or mentally—he can take garrison duty with honor. No shame in it. He's done his service.\"\n\n\"And psychologically,\" the Master adds, \"knowing they have the choice matters. Men fight better when they're there because they want to be, not because they're trapped. Even those who are exhausted might choose to continue if they know they could stop.\"\n\nBaron Alfonso, listening quietly, speaks up: \"After what we just did here—storming that keep—any man who wants to rest has earned it. Some of them have been campaigning since last March. Eleven months.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo starts making notes. \"We'll announce it at dawn formation. Simple message: 'The king offers garrison duty to any man who needs rest. No questions, no shame. Those who march do so freely.'\" He looks up. \"My guess? Maybe four hundred take it. The truly exhausted, the injured who've been pushing through, the older men. The rest will march—either from duty, or because they want to see Granada fall, or because they don't want their comrades to think them weak. But knowing they had the choice changes everything.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava considers the numbers. \"If four hundred take garrison duty and we collect six thousand fresh troops from winter quarters, we still end up with twelve to thirteen thousand for Granada. More than sufficient.\"\n\nA weight seems to lift from the room. This small act of mercy—giving men agency over their fate—cuts through the war-weariness like nothing else could.\n\n\"Good,\" you say. \"Announce it at dawn. Make it clear this is an honorable choice.\"\n\nThe officers disperse to prepare the orders. Tomorrow's march will still be difficult, but the men will know their king sees them as men, not just weapons.\n\nWhat else do you do before dawn?"

Sultan Yusuf concentrated forces but didn't retreat to Granada—he positioned them for ambush. As your split armies advance, Moorish cavalry hits your southern column hard in broken terrain. Simultaneous attack on Infante Juan's northern force. You're fighting defensive battles in disadvantageous positions. Heavy casualties. The enemy is organized, aggressive, and has seized initiative. This will be a long, bloody campaign. 200-300 casualties before you can concentrate forces.\n\n9-16: STRONG ORGANIZED RESISTANCE\nEvery fortress between you and Granada is fully garrisoned and prepared. Illora has 800 troops. Smaller forts have 200-400 each. Sultan Yusuf has positioned 4,000 troops in forward positions with 6,000 more in Granada as reserve. He's not surrendering—he's fighting strategically. Your armies face multiple sieges. Intelligence is poor—scouts ambushed regularly. This becomes a grinding campaign of fortress reduction. Months of work ahead.\n\n17-25: DEFENSIVE STRATEGY - PROTRACTED CAMPAIGN\nThe outer fortresses are garrisoned but not heavily—200-300 each. They're prepared to resist but not die. Sultan has concentrated 7,000 troops in Granada itself with strong defenses. Illora resists your northern army for 2-3 weeks before surrendering. Southern approach fortresses require brief sieges (1-2 weeks each). No disasters, but no easy victories. Standard difficult campaign. You'll reach Granada by late April/early May, but the city will be a hard nut to crack.\n\n26-35: MIXED RESISTANCE\nSome fortresses resist, others surrender quickly. Illora fights (2 weeks to take), but two smaller southern fortresses surrender after seeing your bombards. Sultan has 6,000 troops in Granada, relatively prepared. Intelligence is patchy—some good reports, some areas dark. You're making progress but facing friction. Casualties moderate (50-80). Timeline to invest Granada: mid-to-late April. The city itself will require serious siege work.\n\n36-45: GRADUAL COLLAPSE\nForward fortresses are garrisoned but morale is poor. Illora resists for one week before garrison negotiates surrender. Southern fortresses mostly open gates after token resistance. Sultan has pulled back to Granada with 5,000-6,000 troops. He's consolidating but not aggressively defending outer positions. You're making steady progress with light casualties (20-40). Intelligence decent. Reach Granada by mid-April, but city defenses are being strengthened while you approach.\n\n46-55: WEAKENING DEFENSE\nMost outer fortresses surrender within days of your arrival—garrisons see the writing on the wall. Illora opens gates after brief bombardment demonstration. Sultan has maybe 5,000 troops left in Granada, morale questionable. Some desertions reported. Your march east is relatively smooth with minimal casualties (10-20). Good intelligence from scouts and deserters. You'll invest Granada by early-to-mid April. City has defenses but garrison seems shaky.\n\n56-65: CRUMBLING RESISTANCE\nOuter fortresses surrendering en masse. Illora's garrison sends negotiators before Infante Juan even begins siege—they want terms. Southern fortresses mostly abandoned or surrendered. Sultan definitely weakened—perhaps 4,000-5,000 troops remaining, many foreigners wanting to leave. Your professional troops from winter quarters join enthusiastically—they see victory coming. Minimal casualties (5-10). Excellent intelligence. Reach Granada early April. Sultan may be willing to negotiate.\n\n66-75: STRATEGIC COLLAPSE\nThe withdrawal to Granada was desperation, not strategy. Outer fortresses are being abandoned as you approach—you find several empty, garrisons fled to Granada or disbanded. Illora surrenders immediately when Infante Juan arrives. Sultan has maybe 4,000 troops, mostly foreign mercenaries with uncertain loyalty. Civilian population in Granada is restive. Your march is a triumphal progress—minimal resistance anywhere. Near-zero casualties. Sultan sends preliminary negotiation feelers before you even arrive.\n\n76-85: MASS SURRENDER WAVE\nYour reputation precedes you. Word of your mercy at various sieges has spread. Fortress commanders are surrendering before you arrive—sending riders to negotiate. Illora opens gates when they see Infante Juan's banners approaching. Sultan Yusuf is losing control—garrison commanders defecting, civilians demanding he negotiate. You collect maybe 1,000 surrendered troops who you allow to go home. Zero combat casualties. Sultan sends formal negotiators requesting terms before you reach Granada.\n\n86-92: EMIRATE COLLAPSING\nComplete strategic disintegration. The Emirate is falling apart before your eyes. Fortresses surrendering, troops deserting, local leaders making separate peace. Illora's commander rides out to meet Infante Juan and offers not just surrender but alliance—will hold the north for Castile. Sultan Yusuf is trapped in Granada with maybe 3,000 troops, half wanting to leave. City population is in near-revolt demanding he surrender. You receive three separate negotiation embassies before reaching Granada. The war is functionally over.\n\n93-97: SULTAN SUING FOR PEACE\nSultan Yusuf sends high-level embassy to meet you before you even leave Niebla. \"We cannot win. Let us discuss terms before more blood is shed.\" The withdrawal to Granada was preparation to surrender, not fight. All outer fortresses ordered to surrender peacefully to Castilian forces. Illora opens gates with full honors for Infante Juan. Granada's gates are open—controlled withdrawal to negotiate rather than die. The Emirate is offering itself to you. The question is terms, not conquest.\n\n98-100: MIRACULOUS CAPITULATION\nSomething extraordinary: Sultan Yusuf sends his own son as hostage/negotiator along with formal offer of complete surrender. The eight-month 1431 campaign broke Granada's will entirely. They're offering the city, the treasury, safe passage for those who want to leave, conversion and vassalage for those who stay. Every fortress commander has orders to welcome Castilian troops as new lords. Illora's garrison lines up to cheer Infante Juan. You arrive at Granada to find white flags flying and gates open. The Reconquista ends not with a siege, but with a ceremony.\n\nRoll your d100 to see what strategic situation unfolds as you march on Granada."

          "text": "\"The outer fortresses are garrisoned but not heavily—200-300 each. They're prepared to resist but not die. Sultan has concentrated 7,000 troops in Granada itself with strong defenses. Illora resists your northern army for 2-3 weeks before surrendering. Southern approach fortresses require brief sieges (1-2 weeks each). No disasters, but no easy victories. Standard difficult campaign. You'll reach Granada by late April/early May, but the city will be a hard nut to crack.\"\n\nSo this means:\n- No easy capitulation\n- Fortresses are garrisoned and will resist\n- Not catastrophic, but grinding work\n- Sultan Yusuf is defending strategically\n- Multiple sieges ahead\n- Timeline is extended to late April/early May\n\nI need to describe the march from Niebla, the garrison swaps, collecting professional troops, splitting the armies, and discovering this defensive posture. I should show:\n1. The march beginning and garrison swaps\n2. Intelligence reports coming in showing fortresses are garrisoned\n3. The strategic situation becoming clear\n4. Splitting forces - Infante Juan north to Illora, Juan south with Master of Calatrava\n5. The reality that this will be a grinding campaign\n\nI should stop at a natural point where Juan needs to make decisions about how to proceed.\n\nTHE MARCH ON GRANADA\n\nMarch 18 - March 30, 1432\n\nDawn at Niebla - March 18th\n\nThe pre-dawn formation is tense. Seven thousand exhausted troops assembled in the fortress courtyard and surrounding areas, torches casting flickering shadows. The Master of Calatrava stands before them with your proclamation:\n\n\"His Majesty offers garrison duty to any man who needs rest. Málaga, Antequera, Ronda, Vélez-Málaga all need garrisons. Any man—levy or professional—who wishes to take garrison duty may do so with full honor. No shame. No questions. You've earned it.\"\n\nA ripple passes through the ranks. Men exchange glances. Slowly, hands begin to rise. Groups form as men step forward—some limping from old wounds, others simply hollow-eyed with exhaustion. By the time the count is finished, four hundred and thirty men have chosen garrison duty.\n\nYou see relief on many faces—both those staying and those marching. The choice mattered.\n\nBy full dawn, your column departs Niebla. Sixty-five hundred troops march east, leaving three hundred to garrison the fortress alongside the surrendered knights who swore oaths. Baron Alfonso remains behind to govern Niebla and oversee Sanlúcar—his cousin's former domains now his responsibility.\n\nThe March East - March 18-25\n\nThe route takes you through territory secured last year. Málaga first, then inland toward Antequera and Ronda. At each fortress, the exchange happens: tired levies gratefully take garrison positions while fresh Military Order knights and crown professionals join your column.\n\nMálaga (March 20): Three hundred levy troops garrison the coastal fortress. Eight hundred professional troops from winter quarters—well-rested, well-fed, eager to finish what they started—join your ranks. The garrison commander reports all quiet through winter. No raids, no incidents.\n\nVélez-Málaga (March 21): Similar exchange. Two hundred garrison, six hundred join.\n\nAntequera (March 23): Four hundred garrison, nine hundred join.\n\nRonda (March 25): Three hundred garrison, seven hundred fresh troops.\n\nBy the time you reach the forward staging area near Loja on March 25th, your force has transformed: thirteen thousand troops, predominantly professionals, with the five bombards. The exhausted levies are safely garrisoned. These soldiers are rested, equipped, and ready.\n\nBut the intelligence coming in is troubling.\n\nThe Strategic Reality - March 26-27\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea coordinates the scout reports in your command tent outside Loja. Maps are spread across the table, marked with fortress positions and troop estimates.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he begins grimly, \"Sultan Yusuf hasn't collapsed. He's defending.\"\n\nThe reports paint a clear picture:\n\nNorthern Approach:\n\nÍllora: Major fortress controlling the northern route to Granada. Heavily garrisoned—estimated 600-800 troops. Strong fortifications. Prepared for siege.\n\nMoclín: Secondary fortress. 300 troops. Also prepared.\n\nSouthern Approach:\n\nAlhama de Granada: Key fortress 25 miles southwest of Granada. 400-500 troops garrisoned. Strategic position.\n\nLoja: Already in your hands from last year's campaign.\n\nMontefrío: Northwest of Granada. 350 troops. Fortified.\n\nGranada Itself:\n\nSultan Yusuf has concentrated approximately 7,000 troops in the capital.\n\nCity defenses being strengthened through winter.\n\nWalls repaired, provisions stockpiled.\n\nCivilian population nervous but not rebellious.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava studies the map. \"He's not surrendering, Your Majesty. He's making us work for it. Each fortress will require a proper siege—one to three weeks depending on resistance. And Granada itself...\" He taps the capital. \"That could take months.\"\n\nInfante Juan—who rode from Toledo to join you two days ago with additional forces—frowns at the map. \"So we grind through his outer defenses, then face a siege of the capital with a garrison of seven thousand?\"\n\n\"That's his strategy,\" Don Rodrigo confirms. \"Make us spend lives and time on every position. Hope we tire, hope reinforcements arrive for him, hope something breaks our momentum.\"\n\nYou study the map silently. The original hope—that Granada would see reason and surrender—is clearly not happening. This will be a campaign.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava waits for your orders. \"How do you want to proceed, Your Majesty? Do we concentrate on one fortress at a time, or split our forces to pressure multiple positions simultaneously?\"\n\nWhat do you command?"

          "text": "The Master of Calatrava nods sharply. \"Concentrated force on Íllora, secondary force on Moclín. Good. We deny them mutual support and keep pressure on multiple fronts.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo begins issuing orders immediately: \"Riders to Jaén—assemble all available forces. Crown troops, city militia, whatever we can muster. Target: three thousand men. March orders for Moclín as soon as assembled.\" He looks to Infante Juan. \"Will you command the Moclín operation?\"\n\nInfante Juan straightens. \"Gladly. Give me three thousand troops and I'll take that fortress.\"\n\n\"You won't have the bombards,\" you remind him. \"Can you manage without artillery?\"\n\n\"Moclín is smaller than Íllora. We'll use siege towers, rams, mining if necessary. It'll take longer, but it's doable.\" He studies the map. \"The key is coordinating timing. If we both attack within days of each other, they can't reinforce either position.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava calculates: \"We can march on Íllora immediately—arrive in three days. Jaén's forces will need... a week to assemble? Maybe ten days? That gives us time to begin bombardment at Íllora before Infante Juan moves. The Sultan will have to choose where to send any relief forces.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo adds: \"And if he sends relief anywhere, he weakens Granada itself. Either way, we're applying pressure.\"\n\nWithin hours, the orders are dispatched. Riders gallop north toward Jaén carrying mobilization commands. Your main army—thirteen thousand strong with five bombards—begins the march northeast toward Íllora.\n\nThe March to Íllora - March 28-30\n\nThe route takes you through increasingly hostile territory. These lands are still under Granadan control, and the Sultan's forces know you're coming.\n\nMarch 28: Your vanguard skirmishes with Moorish light cavalry—probing attacks, nothing serious. They fade into the hills after brief exchanges. Clearly scouting your strength and route. No casualties, but it's a reminder you're entering enemy territory.\n\nMarch 29: More aggressive harassment. Fifty Moorish horsemen hit your supply train, trying to slow the artillery. Your cavalry drives them off, but two oxen are killed and a wagon damaged. Pietro curses as repairs delay the column by three hours.\n\nMarch 30 (Morning): You crest a ridge and see it.\n\nÍllora.\n\nThe fortress sits on a rocky hill dominating the surrounding countryside. Stone walls encircle the town and fortress proper—perhaps eight hundred buildings clustered within the defenses. The castle itself crowns the highest point, its keep rising another sixty feet above the walls. Banners of Granada—green with gold crescents—fly defiantly from multiple towers.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is broken—olive groves, scattered farms, rocky outcroppings. Decent approach routes for your artillery exist, but the fortress has clear sight lines in all directions. No surprise possible.\n\nAs your army comes into view, you hear distant sounds from the fortress—bells ringing, horns calling. They're alerting the garrison. By the time your vanguard reaches the base of the hill, you can see movement on the walls. Hundreds of soldiers taking positions.\n\nDon Rodrigo rides up beside you, studying the defenses. \"Well-sited. Good walls. That's not going to fall quickly.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava joins you. \"Six hundred to eight hundred garrison, based on intelligence. Possibly more if they reinforced it recently. The town walls will need to be breached before we can even approach the castle.\"\n\nPietro Calabrese is already surveying potential artillery positions. \"The western approach looks best, Your Majesty. We can set up at four hundred yards—outside effective arrow range—and target the town walls. Three to five days of bombardment should create a breach. Then we fight through the town to reach the castle.\"\n\nThe sun is past noon. Your army is arriving in sections, spreading out around the fortress to begin encirclement. No response from the fortress yet—no parley offers, no surrender demands. Just defensive preparations visible on the walls.\n\nYou need to establish siege lines, position artillery, organize your forces. The siege of Íllora has begun.\n\nWhat are your orders?"

The massive bronze gun bursts catastrophically, killing Pietro Calabrese and eight crew members instantly, wounding a dozen more. Shrapnel tears through nearby positions. The explosion destroys a second bombard's carriage. You're down to THREE operational guns. The remaining crews are terrified, refusing to fire at normal rates. Bombardment effectiveness drops by 60%. Garrison morale soars—they see it as divine protection. This siege just became months longer.\n\n6-10: MAJOR SETBACK - SUCCESSFUL SORTIE\nDay 4: Massive sortie at dawn—400 Moorish troops pour from a sally port. They hit your artillery positions hard and competently. Despite your protective measures, they reach the guns. One bombard is badly damaged (repairable but needs weeks). Powder stores are set ablaze. Fierce fighting kills 45 of your men, wounds 80 more. They withdraw successfully before being overwhelmed. You've lost a week of progress and significant supplies. Pietro is livid—\"They're good, Your Majesty. Very good.\"\n\n11-18: SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS\nDay 3: Heavy rains begin. Not catastrophic storm but sustained rainfall that turns siege works to mud. Gun positions become unstable, requiring constant maintenance. Powder must be protected obsessively. Bombardment slows to half-rate. Day 5: Sortie during the rain kills 18 men and damages supplies. Day 6: More rain. Your camp is miserable—disease starting to appear. By end of week: minimal wall damage, no breach in sight, 25 dead from combat and illness. This will take much longer than expected.\n\n19-27: DIFFICULT PROGRESS\nBombardment begins well but garrison proves competent. Aggressive arrow fire from walls forces you to build more extensive protective works, delaying gun positioning by two days. When bombardment starts, defenders make effective repairs each night—your daily progress is partially undone. Day 5: Small sortie (80 men) harasses positions, kills 12, disrupts work. By week's end: wall section showing serious damage but no breach yet. Casualties: 20 dead, 35 wounded. Another week needed minimum.\n\n28-38: GRINDING SIEGE WARFARE\nStandard difficult siege. Bombardment is effective but slow. Defenders repair at night, you damage by day—net progress but gradual. Two small sorties (days 3 and 6) cause casualties but are driven back: 15 dead, 28 wounded total. Garrison uses incendiary arrows trying to reach powder stores—your protective measures work but it's nerve-wracking. By week's end: significant wall damage, breach developing but not assault-ready. Need 3-4 more days of bombardment. Standard attrition.\n\n39-50: STEADY BUT UNSPECTACULAR\nProfessional siege operations proceeding normally. Bombardment creates steady damage. Defenders attempt repairs but can't keep up. One sortie attempt (Day 4) is spotted early and driven back before reaching guns—minimal casualties (6 dead, 10 wounded). Good protective measures around artillery working. By week's end: clear breach forming, maybe 15 feet wide. Not quite assault-ready but close. Two more days of bombardment should do it. Competent but unremarkable progress.\n\n51-62: EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS\nYour protective measures and experienced crews make the difference. Bombardment is methodical and effective. Defenders attempt one sortie (Day 5) but your prepared response crushes it—they lose 35 men, you lose 8. Wall damage accumulates faster than they can repair. Intelligence from deserters (3 men) provides useful information about internal morale and defenses. By week's end: breach 20 feet wide, assault-ready with one more day of bombardment. Casualties light: 10 dead, 18 wounded. Good progress.\n\n63-73: STRONG PROGRESS\nExcellent bombardment effectiveness. Pietro's crews work like a machine. The wall section you're targeting has structural weaknesses your gunners exploit brilliantly. Day 4: Major section collapses spectacularly—30-foot breach opens. Garrison attempts sortie but your alert defenses slaughter them (50 Moorish dead, 5 Castilian dead). Deserters increase (8 men) reporting low morale. By week's end: breach fully assault-ready, 35 feet wide. Additional bombardment could target castle directly. Minimal casualties: 7 dead, 12 wounded. Excellent progress.\n\n74-82: RAPID BREAKTHROUGH\nEverything goes right. Wall section proves weaker than expected—old construction over unstable foundation. Day 3: Major collapse creates 25-foot breach. Day 5: Follow-up bombardment widens it to 40 feet with gentle rubble slopes. Garrison morale visibly cracking—no effective sorties attempted. Deserters (15 men) provide detailed intelligence. Your protective measures work perfectly—zero damage to artillery. By week's end: assault-ready breach, possibly weak enough morale for surrender offer. Casualties: 4 dead, 8 wounded from harassing fire only.\n\n83-90: GARRISON WEAKENING\nNot just bombardment success but psychological warfare working. Deserters (25+ men) streaming out at night. They report commander struggling to maintain order, foreign mercenaries wanting to leave, food supplies adequate but morale terrible. Your bombardment is devastating—Day 4 creates major breach, Day 6 widens it dramatically. One half-hearted sortie attempt (Day 5) is easily repulsed. By week's end: 45-foot breach, garrison probably ready to negotiate. Casualties: 3 dead, 6 wounded. They're breaking.\n\n91-96: NEAR-COLLAPSE\nSpectacular effectiveness. Day 3: Entire wall section collapses—60-foot breach appears. Garrison is stunned. Deserters flood out (40+ men). Internal reports of mutiny attempts, commander barely in control. No sorties—they're too demoralized. Your bombardment shifts to castle itself, damaging towers. White flags appear briefly on Day 6 before being torn down—internal conflict visible. By week's end: massive breach, garrison on verge of surrender. Casualties: 2 dead, 3 wounded. Victory imminent.\n\n97-100: UNEXPECTED SURRENDER\nDay 5: White flags appear on the walls. Garrison commander sends negotiators: \"We cannot win. The wall is broken, morale is gone. Let us discuss terms before pointless bloodshed.\" Your bombardment proved so devastating, garrison so demoralized, that they're surrendering after just five days. The breach is ready but unnecessary. Fortress can be yours through negotiation. Zero combat casualties. Íllora falls without assault. Huge psychological blow to Granada's remaining fortresses.\n\nRoll your d100 to see what happens during the first week of the siege of Íllora."

          "text": "March 30 - April 6, 1432\n\nDay One: March 30 (Afternoon-Evening)\n\nYour forces encircle Íllora methodically. Thirteen thousand troops spread around the fortress perimeter—far too many for the garrison to break through even if they tried. Siege lines are dug at three hundred yards, trenches connecting positions, supply depots established well back from the walls.\n\nPietro Calabrese personally supervises the artillery positioning. The western approach offers the best terrain—a slight rise four hundred yards from the town walls that provides stable ground and a clear firing line. He orders elaborate protective works built around each gun position: earth-filled gabions stacked in semicircles, wooden mantlets for the crews, trenches connecting positions for quick retreat if needed.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he explains as the works go up, \"after what happened at Niebla with that sortie during the storm, I'm taking no chances. These guns are protected like the Crown Jewels.\"\n\nBy evening, five gun positions are ready. The bombards are rolled into place with extreme care—oxen straining, crews guiding every inch. Each massive bronze barrel is loaded: powder measured precisely, stone shot weighing two hundred pounds carefully seated, priming powder applied.\n\nFrom the walls of Íllora, you can see defenders watching. Torches illuminate their battlements. They know what's coming.\n\nDay Two: March 31 - Bombardment Begins\n\nDawn breaks clear and cold. Pietro walks the line of guns one final time, checking everything personally. Then he turns to you and salutes.\n\n\"Ready when you are, Your Majesty.\"\n\nYou nod.\n\n\"Fire!\"\n\nAll five bombards roar in sequence—a rolling thunder that echoes off the hills. Smoke billows. Stone balls arc through the morning air and slam into the western wall of Íllora. The impacts are visible even from four hundred yards—stone chips flying, dust rising, the solid crack of rock on rock.\n\nThe bombardment settles into rhythm. Fire, reload, fire again. Every thirty minutes, another volley. Pietro's crews work with professional efficiency born of months of practice—measuring powder with precision, ramming shot home properly, maintaining the guns between shots.\n\nBy noon, the target wall section shows the first signs of damage. By evening, after eight volleys, the mortar between stones is visibly crumbling.\n\nDay Three: April 1 - The Weakness Revealed\n\nThe second day of bombardment brings a discovery.\n\nMid-morning, Pietro is studying the wall through a spyglass when he suddenly laughs—a sharp, delighted sound. \"Your Majesty! Look at this!\"\n\nYou peer through the glass. Where your shots have been concentrating, you can see something the defenders probably hoped you wouldn't notice: the wall construction changes about twenty feet up. The lower portion is older, thicker stone—probably original construction. But the upper section is newer, thinner masonry. A repair or expansion from decades ago.\n\n\"They built on top of the old wall,\" Pietro explains, grinning. \"The foundation is solid, but that upper section? That's going to come down like a house of cards once we destabilize it.\"\n\nHe adjusts the gun elevations slightly, targeting the junction between old and new construction. The bombardment continues with renewed purpose.\n\nBy evening, deep cracks are visible running along that seam. The wall is beginning to fail structurally.\n\nDay Four: April 2 - The Collapse\n\nIt happens mid-morning on the fourth day.\n\nPietro has concentrated fire on three specific stones at the junction point—the keystone holding the upper section in place. Shot after shot hammers them. You can see the stones loosening, mortar falling away in chunks.\n\nThe third volley of the morning strikes perfectly.\n\nThere's a pause—a moment of silence—and then a sound like distant thunder. The entire upper section of wall—a stretch perhaps thirty feet wide and fifteen feet high—suddenly gives way. It doesn't crumble gradually. It collapses all at once in a spectacular cascade of masonry and dust.\n\nWhen the dust clears, you're staring at a massive breach. The lower wall section still stands, but everything above it is gone. Rubble has spilled down both sides creating rough ramps. The breach is thirty feet wide and reaches nearly to the top of the remaining wall.\n\nA cheer erupts from your siege lines. Men pound weapons against shields. Pietro is embracing his gun crews, laughing.\n\nFrom Íllora's walls, you can see panic. Defenders scrambling, officers shouting orders, men rushing to the breach point with timber and sandbags to try to shore it up.\n\nBut there's no repairing that. The structural damage is done.\n\nDay Five: April 3 - The Failed Sortie\n\nYou should have expected it.\n\nTwo hours before dawn, your sentries spot movement at Íllora's northern gate. Torches. The sounds of many men assembling.\n\nThe alarm spreads instantly. Your prepared response kicks in—captains rousing troops, defensive positions manned, cavalry mounting to respond. By the time the gate opens and Moorish troops pour out, you're ready.\n\nPerhaps two hundred fifty men charge from the fortress—picked troops, well-armed, moving fast toward your artillery positions. Their goal is obvious: damage the guns before the breach can be widened further.\n\nThey run straight into a prepared defense.\n\nYour infantry forms shield walls across their approach. Crossbowmen positioned in the siege works loose volley after volley into the charging mass. Cavalry sweeps in from the flanks.\n\nThe Moorish troops fight with desperate courage. They reach your forward trenches, clash with your shield wall, try to break through. But they're outnumbered five to one and attacking prepared positions. The battle is vicious but brief.\n\nYour cavalry completes the encirclement. The sortie breaks apart—some men trying to retreat, others fighting to the death, a handful throwing down weapons to surrender.\n\nWhen it's over, the ground before your positions is littered with Moorish dead and wounded. Your chaplain counts approximately fifty bodies. Another fifteen captured, wounded. The rest retreated back to the fortress.\n\nYour casualties: five dead, nine wounded. The artillery positions were never even threatened.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava surveys the battlefield grimly. \"They had to try. But we were ready. That sortie cost them a tenth of their garrison and accomplished nothing.\"\n\nDays Six-Seven: April 4-6 - The Breach Widens\n\nWith the sortie crushed and no further resistance, Pietro returns to systematic bombardment. The collapsed section becomes the focus—widening the breach, clearing obstacles, making the rubble ramps more accessible for assault troops.\n\nDay Six brings more structural failure. Another section of wall adjacent to the original breach gives way—not as spectacularly, but steadily. By evening, the breach is forty feet wide.\n\nDay Seven: Further refinement. Pietro knocks down protruding stones that might snag assault troops. The rubble ramps on both sides are smoothed by repeated impacts. By midday, you're looking at a fully assault-ready breach—wide, accessible, with clear approaches.\n\nAnd throughout these days, a new development: deserters.\n\nThe first comes on Day Five evening—a young soldier who swims across the small stream separating the fortress from your lines, hands raised, begging for mercy. Don Rodrigo's men bring him in for questioning.\n\n\"The garrison is frightened,\" the deserter reports. \"That wall collapse... they've never seen anything like it. The commander is trying to keep order, but men are talking about surrender. The foreign mercenaries especially—they say this isn't their fight.\"\n\nMore follow over the next two days. By the end of the week, eight men have deserted. All tell similar stories: morale crumbling, supplies adequate but spirits broken, arguments between the Granadan locals and foreign troops about whether to fight or surrender.\n\nDon Rodrigo compiles the intelligence: \"Six hundred to seven hundred troops remaining in the garrison. Commander is holding firm so far, but his grip is weakening. The breach has them terrified—they know if we assault through that gap, it's going to be a slaughter.\"\n\nApril 6 Evening - Status Report\n\nThe Master of Calatrava joins you overlooking the breach as the sun sets.\n\n\"Seven days, Your Majesty. One major breach, garrison morale cracking, minimal casualties on our side.\" He counts on his fingers: \"Seven dead, twelve wounded—five from the sortie, the rest from harassing arrow fire. Pietro's protective measures worked perfectly. Not a scratch on the artillery.\"\n\nYou study the breach in the dying light. Forty feet wide, rubble ramps on both sides, completely passable. Assault troops could advance through it in formation tomorrow if ordered.\n\n\"The breach is ready,\" the Master continues. \"We could storm it at dawn. Or...\" He pauses. \"We could offer terms. Those deserters say the garrison is on edge. A generous surrender offer might finish this without more bloodshed.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo joins the discussion. \"Or we continue bombardment—shift to targeting the castle itself now that the town walls are breached. Break them further before offering anything.\"\n\nPietro appears, wiping powder residue from his hands. \"The guns are performing beautifully, Your Majesty. Whatever you want to hit next, we can hit it.\"\n\nFrom Íllora, torches illuminate the breach. You can see defenders working frantically to build internal barricades behind the gap—preparing for the assault they know is coming.\n\nWhat do you command?"

          "text": "Success Factors (exist at all roll levels):\n- The breach is massive and assault-ready - they WILL lose if they fight\n- Juan's reputation for mercy is established (Sanlúcar, even complicated at Niebla)\n- Eight deserters have left - morale is genuinely cracking\n- Juan is the KING personally offering terms - huge honor/legitimacy\n- They've fought honorably for a week - he's acknowledging this\n- Foreign mercenaries in garrison want out\n- The sortie failed catastrophically\n- No relief force is coming\n- Granada's strategic position is hopeless\n\nFailure Factors (exist at all roll levels):\n- Commander's honor and duty to Sultan\n- Fear of what surrender means for them personally\n- Uncertainty about whether Juan's mercy extends to Muslims\n- Religious/cultural divide - harder to trust Christian enemy\n- Professional soldiers' pride\n- Possible hardliners in garrison opposed to surrender\n- Memory that Diego chose death over terms (though different situation)\n- Sultan Yusuf still fighting - surrendering feels like betrayal\n\nNow I create a table where low rolls = failure factors dominate the reaction (hostile, fearful, defiant), high rolls = success factors dominate (receptive, hopeful, eager to negotiate). But the FACTS don't change - the breach exists, Juan is merciful, they're in trouble. What changes is how they RESPOND emotionally/politically.\n\nLow rolls: They see the facts but fear/pride/duty makes them hostile or paralyzed\nMid rolls: They see the facts, internal division, some want to talk\n\nHigh rolls: Rational assessment prevails. The garrison leadership recognizes the inevitable and sees negotiation as the most honorable path. They view Juan's offer as a dignified exit strategy, preserving their professional reputation while avoiding needless bloodshed. The mercenaries' desire to leave and the clear strategic hopelessness tip the balance toward constructive engagement.\n\nI'll evaluate the success and failure factors for Juan's personal offer of terms, then create a custom d100 persuasion table.\n\nJUAN'S OFFER OF TERMS AT ÍLLORA - ANALYSIS\n\nSuccess Factors (exist regardless of roll):\n\nMassive assault-ready breach: They cannot win militarily\n\nPersonal approach by the King: Immense honor being shown\n\nEstablished mercy reputation: Word of your terms at various sieges has spread\n\n\"Honor demands\" acknowledgment: You're validating their resistance\n\nGarrison morale cracking: Eight deserters, internal divisions reported\n\nFailed sortie: They tried aggression and lost badly\n\nForeign mercenaries present: They want an exit\n\nNo relief coming: Granada cannot save them\n\nStrategic hopelessness: The Emirate is losing overall\n\nFailure Factors (exist regardless of roll):\n\nDuty to Sultan: Commander sworn to defend\n\nReligious/cultural divide: Harder to trust Christian enemy\n\nUncertainty about terms: What does \"surrender\" actually mean for Muslims?\n\nProfessional pride: Soldiers' honor in continued resistance\n\nHardliner faction: Some always oppose surrender\n\nFear of consequences: Personal safety concerns\n\nRecent example: Diego chose death (though different context)\n\nFace-saving needs: Can't appear to capitulate easily\n\nD100 TABLE: GARRISON RESPONSE TO JUAN'S OFFER\n\n1-12: HOSTILE REJECTION\nLong silence, then arrows. Not aimed at you—that would violate truce—but at the ground near your position. Message clear. A voice shouts from walls in Arabic-accented Castilian: \"We know what Christian mercy means! We'll die before we surrender to you!\" The breach exists, your reputation exists, but fear and mistrust dominate. They're convinced surrender means death or slavery anyway. Hardliners control the response. The success factors can't overcome their terror and defiance.\n\n13-25: DEFIANT REFUSAL\nThe gate remains closed. After long pause, a commander appears on the walls—too distant to negotiate properly. \"We've held this fortress for generations! We'll hold it still! Take your terms elsewhere, King of Castile!\" His voice is steady but you can see tension in his posture. The facts are acknowledged but professional pride won't let them negotiate. Some faces on the walls look relieved by his defiance, others troubled. Your points landed but duty won out.\n\n26-38: FEARFUL PARALYSIS\nSilence from the gate. You can see movement on the walls—men arguing, gesturing. Your offer has created chaos inside. Finally a voice: \"We... we need time! To consult! To discuss!\" Not acceptance, not rejection—paralysis. The success factors are real to them, but so are the fears. Internal factions are fighting. Some want to negotiate, others refuse. They're stuck, unable to decide. You've created a crisis of command but no resolution yet.\n\n39-52: CAUTIOUS INQUIRY\nAfter tense minutes, a voice from the gate: \"What terms? What do you offer?\" Not commitment, just asking. The facts you presented—the breach, the hopelessness, your mercy reputation—are being taken seriously. But doubt remains strong. \"How do we know you speak truth? How do we know we won't be slaughtered if we open gates?\" They're considering it but extremely wary. Success factors acknowledged; failure factors still powerful. Need more convincing.\n\n53-65: DIVIDED RESPONSE - NEGOTIATION POSSIBLE\nThe gate opens slightly. A senior officer appears with guards, stops twenty yards from walls. \"Your Majesty.\" He's formal, tense. \"We hear your words. Some in garrison... wish to discuss. Others say we betray our Sultan.\" Internal division is visible—you can see more arguments happening behind him. \"If you offer good terms, if you guarantee safety... perhaps we can talk. But our commander is not yet decided.\" Your success factors are working on part of the garrison. Need to negotiate carefully.\n\n66-77: RESPECTFUL CONSIDERATION\nAfter brief wait, the gate opens. A delegation of three officers emerges under white flag—approaching cautiously but with dignity. The lead commander salutes. \"Your Majesty, we've seen the breach. We know our position. You've fought honorably and offered honorably.\" He's acknowledging all your success factors. \"But we have duties, concerns. What exactly do you offer? Safe passage? For everyone? What of our families in the town?\" Ready to negotiate seriously, but needs details to overcome remaining fears.\n\n78-87: EAGER NEGOTIATION\nThe response is swift. Gate opens and a delegation of five officers rides out, dismounting respectfully before you. \"Your Majesty, we hoped you would offer terms.\" Relief is visible on their faces. \"The breach is clear, relief is not coming, and we've heard of your mercy at other sieges. We don't wish pointless death.\" They're ready to negotiate constructively—success factors have convinced them. \"What terms do you offer? We want to surrender with honor. Our families safe. Soldiers allowed to leave or take service with you if willing.\"\n\n88-94: GRATEFUL ACCEPTANCE PRINCIPLE\nAlmost immediate response. The gate opens and the garrison commander himself appears with full delegation. He approaches, removes his helmet respectfully. \"Your Majesty, God is merciful, and you have shown you are too.\" His voice is sincere. \"We cannot win. We know this. You've given us a week to see it clearly. If you offer fair terms—safety for civilians, honor for soldiers—we will open these gates.\" Success factors have overwhelmed fears. Just needs formal terms to finalize. \"Tell us what you offer and we will likely accept.\"\n\n95-100: IMMEDIATE RELIEF AND SURRENDER\nThe gates swing open before you finish speaking. The garrison commander strides out, sword sheathed, hands open. Behind him, soldiers are cheering—actual cheering. \"Your Majesty, thank God you offered terms!\" He's almost weeping with relief. \"We've been arguing for days whether anyone would show mercy. The foreign troops wanted to desert, the locals feared slavery, everyone terrified of assault through that breach.\" He gestures to the breach. \"You've won. We all know it. Just tell us we can leave with our lives and dignity, and this fortress is yours today. Please, no more bloodshed.\"\n\nRoll your d100 to see how the garrison responds to Juan's personal offer."

          "text": "Roll of 56 falls in the \"DIVIDED RESPONSE - NEGOTIATION POSSIBLE\" category (53-65). This means:\n- The gate opens slightly\n- A senior officer appears with guards, stops twenty yards from walls\n- He acknowledges Juan's words formally and tensely\n- He mentions internal division - some want to discuss, others say they betray their Sultan\n- The division is visible, arguments happening behind him\n- He suggests negotiation is possible if terms are good and safety guaranteed\n- But the commander hasn't decided yet\n- Success factors are working on part of the garrison, but need careful negotiation\n\nI should write this scene showing:\n1. The tense wait after Juan's call\n2. The gate opening slightly\n3. The officer appearing with visible tension\n4. Clear signs of internal conflict\n5. His cautious, formal response\n6. Visible arguments behind him\n7. The conditional openness to negotiation\n8. Stop when Juan needs to respond with actual terms or further persuasion\n\nYour words echo off the stone walls and die away into silence.\n\nYou stand before the main gate in your white armor, the banner of truce held by the man beside you snapping in the breeze. Behind you at a respectful distance, your household guard waits—García and Fernando among them, hands near swords despite the truce flag. Further back, thousands of troops watch from the siege lines.\n\nThe silence stretches. Thirty seconds. A minute.\n\nYou can see movement on the walls—heads turning, men gesturing urgently to each other. Raised voices carry down, though the words are indistinct. Arguments. People pointing at you, at the breach, at each other.\n\nTwo minutes.\n\nThen, with the grinding sound of wood on stone, the main gate opens.\n\nNot fully. Perhaps five feet—just wide enough for men to emerge in single file. The gap is cautious, defensive, ready to slam shut at the first sign of treachery.\n\nA senior officer steps through, flanked by four guards with drawn swords. He's perhaps forty, graying beard, wearing good armor beneath a green surcoat bearing Granada's crescent. His face is tight with tension. He walks forward twenty yards from the gate—close enough to speak, far enough to retreat quickly—and stops.\n\nBehind him, through the partially open gate, you can see more movement. Officers clustered just inside, clearly arguing. One man gestures sharply toward you, another shakes his head violently. A third is speaking urgently, hands raised in what looks like pleading. The internal division is visible and raw.\n\nThe officer before you removes his helmet and tucks it under his arm. He meets your eyes but his jaw is clenched.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His Castilian is accented but clear. Formal. Carefully neutral.\n\nHe pauses, choosing words. Behind him, the argument at the gate intensifies—you hear raised voices in Arabic.\n\n\"We...\" He stops, starts again. \"Some in the garrison hear your words. The breach is clear. We are not blind.\" His hand moves slightly toward where the shattered wall stands. \"We know our position. You have fought with honor. You offer with honor.\"\n\nAnother pause. More shouting from the gate behind him—two men now clearly in heated argument, one pointing at the breach, the other toward the castle.\n\n\"But we have duties, Your Majesty. Oaths to Sultan Yusuf. Families in this town. And...\" He hesitates. \"There are those who say to negotiate is to betray everything. That Christian terms mean slavery or death, whatever the promises.\"\n\nFrom the walls, you can see some soldiers nodding at his words. Others look troubled, hopeful even.\n\nThe officer takes a breath. \"Our commander has not yet decided. Some captains wish to discuss terms. Others say we dishonor ourselves even speaking to you.\" Behind him, the argument has become loud enough that you can hear the anger in the voices even without understanding the words. \"If you offer good terms—truly good terms—if you guarantee safety for all, not just soldiers but families, everyone...\"\n\nHe stops, clearly wrestling with what to say next. His guards shift nervously, watching both you and the chaos behind them at the gate.\n\n\"What exactly do you offer, Your Majesty? Because there are men on these walls ready to die for honor, and others desperate to live for their children. We are... divided.\"\n\nAs if to punctuate his words, a crash comes from inside the gate—someone has thrown something in anger. The shouting intensifies. The officer's jaw tightens further.\n\nHe waits for your answer, but his eyes keep flicking back toward the gate, toward the garrison tearing itself apart over whether to trust your offer.\n\nWhat do you say?"

It should help with the moderate faction while the hardliners will still resist. The garrison is divided, so this is about whether the moderates can win the internal argument.\n\nSince they're already divided and Juan's response is quite good, I think this should push things toward the surrender side, but there's still real chance the hardliners win or it descends into chaos.\n\nLet me create a persuasion table where the success/failure factors persist across the spectrum.\n\nI'll evaluate how Juan's response lands with the divided garrison and create a d100 persuasion table.\n\nJUAN'S TERMS AT ÍLLORA - ANALYSIS\n\nSuccess Factors in Juan's Response (exist regardless of roll):\n\nRespectful Arabic greeting: Shows cultural awareness and respect\n\nAcknowledges honor directly: Validates their position\n\nReligious common ground: God/Allah parallel finds shared framework\n\nSpecific, clear terms: No ambiguity about what's offered\n\nEstablished trustworthy reputation: \"Always true to my word\" backed by history\n\nNo forced conversions: Addresses major Muslim fear\n\nSafe conduct with banners: Military honor preserved\n\nRealistic about consequences: Honest about alternative without sadism\n\nGives them agency: Not trying to manipulate or pressure\n\nFailure Factors in Juan's Response (exist regardless of roll):\n\n\"Christian rule\" means subjugation: Still losing sovereignty\n\nLeaving means exile: Many have families, homes here\n\nPlunder threat frightens civilians: Families at risk if they fight\n\nTrust barrier remains: Will a Christian king really keep promises?\n\nHardliner faction: Some see any negotiation as betrayal\n\nReligious/cultural divide: Deep-seated mistrust persists\n\nSultan's authority: Direct disobedience to their lord\n\nNo guarantee about future: \"No forced conversions\" now, but later?\n\nD100 TABLE: GARRISON RESPONSE TO JUAN'S TERMS\n\n1-15: HARDLINERS WIN - REJECTION\nYour words land, your terms are heard—acknowledged even as reasonable—but the hardliners seize control. From behind the officer, you hear shouting erupt. A captain appears at the gate: \"NO! We negotiate nothing! This is betrayal!\" The officer before you looks torn, even anguished—your terms ARE fair, he knows it—but he's being overruled. \"I... Your Majesty, I cannot. My commander refuses. We will defend.\" He backs toward the gate. The success factors existed, but fear and rigid honor won the internal battle. Prepare for assault.\n\n16-28: PARALYSIS DEEPENS\nYour terms create more chaos, not less. The officer nods slowly—\"These are... fair terms. Better than expected\"—but behind him the argument explodes into near-violence. Men shouting, shoving. Some want to accept, others are screaming about betrayal. The officer turns, tries to calm them, fails. \"Your Majesty, we... I need time. Hours. Maybe a day. We're tearing apart.\" Your good terms are recognized but can't overcome the internal divisions. They're deadlocked, paralyzed. May need more pressure or more time.\n\n29-42: FRACTURED NEGOTIATION\nThe officer struggles visibly. \"Your terms are honorable, Your Majesty. I believe you mean them.\" Your success factors are working on him personally. \"But—\" He gestures helplessly at the chaos behind him. \"Half the garrison wants to accept. The other half calls them cowards. Our commander is caught between.\" The argument is now audible even to you—Arabic and Spanish mixed, men clearly split. \"Some will surrender. Others will fight to the end. I don't know if we can agree as one garrison.\" Civil war brewing inside. Your terms are good but may fracture them rather than unite them.\n\n43-56: GRUDGING CONSIDERATION\nThe officer listens carefully, clearly weighing every word. Your religious parallel makes him pause—a slight nod. The specific terms about safe conduct and no forced conversion are acknowledged: \"These are... more generous than we feared.\" But doubt remains in his eyes. Behind him, the argument continues but less violently. \"I will bring this to our commander and council. Your word carries weight—we've heard you keep promises. But trust is hard.\" He's genuinely considering, success factors are real to him, but fear of deception persists. \"Give us until sunset to decide?\"\n\n57-68: MODERATE FACTION STRENGTHENED\nYour response shifts the internal balance. The officer's posture relaxes slightly. \"Salaam aleikum, Your Majesty. You show respect we did not expect.\" The Arabic greeting and religious parallel resonate. Behind him, you see some of the arguers stop, lean in to hear. \"These terms—banners, safe conduct, no forced conversions—this is more than honor demands.\" He turns to his fellows at the gate: \"You hear? He offers what we hoped but feared to ask!\" The moderates are gaining ground. Hardliners still resist but losing argument. \"I believe we can accept this. I will urge my commander to do so.\"\n\n69-79: STRONG MOMENTUM TOWARD ACCEPTANCE\nThe officer removes a glove and extends his hand slightly—not quite offering to shake, but a gesture of good faith. \"Your Majesty, you speak with wisdom and mercy. The terms are fair. More than fair.\" Behind him, several officers are nodding vigorously. One calls out: \"The King offers honor! Our families safe! What more can we ask?\" The tide is turning. Hardliners are still arguing but clearly losing. \"I will recommend acceptance to our commander. I believe he will agree. By tonight, this fortress could be yours—without more blood.\" Success factors have won most of them over.\n\n80-88: ACCEPTANCE WITH FINAL DETAILS\nThe officer steps forward two paces, clearly moved. \"Your Majesty... Salaam aleikum. Your respect honors us. Your terms honor us.\" Behind him, the chaos is resolving—officers clasping hands, nodding to each other. \"We will accept. The garrison will march out with banners, take safe conduct. Those who wish to stay under your rule may. Those who wish to leave—to Granada or beyond—may.\" He pauses. \"Two requests: time to organize departure properly—perhaps two days? And written guarantees for the townspeople that they will not be harmed?\" Almost complete agreement. Just working out logistics.\n\n89-95: GRATEFUL ACCEPTANCE\nThe officer actually smiles slightly—relief washing over his face. \"Your Majesty, may God—may Allah—bless you for this mercy. You could have simply stormed that breach and slaughtered us. Instead you offer honor and safety.\" He turns, calls back to the gate in Arabic. You see men embracing, some weeping with relief. \"We accept. All of it. We will open the gates tomorrow at dawn. The garrison will march out with full honors, and this fortress is yours. Thank you, Your Majesty. You've saved many lives today.\"\n\n96-100: IMMEDIATE JOYFUL SURRENDER\nBefore the officer can respond, a commotion erupts behind him. The garrison commander himself pushes through the gate—older man, dignified, but with tears streaming down his face. \"Your Majesty!\" He strides forward, falls to one knee. \"Allah is merciful, and you are His instrument today! We accept! All of it! The town will open gates within the hour! Please, take this fortress in peace!\" Behind him, soldiers are cheering—actual cheering—throwing down weapons in relief. \"You've given us what we prayed for but didn't dare hope for—life, honor, safety. Bless you, King of Castile. This war can end with mercy, not slaughter.\"\n\nRoll your d100 to see how the garrison responds to Juan's specific terms."

          "text": "The roll is 60, which falls in the \"57-68: MODERATE FACTION STRENGTHENED\" range. This means Juan's response has shifted the internal balance toward acceptance. The officer is convinced, the moderates are gaining ground, hardliners are still resisting but losing the argument. He believes they can accept and will urge the commander to do so.\n\nI should show:\n1. The officer's positive reaction to Juan's terms\n2. The shift in the internal dynamics behind him\n3. The moderates gaining strength in the argument\n4. The hardliners still present but losing ground\n5. The officer's commitment to urge acceptance\n6. A realistic timeline for their decision\n7. The tension still present but momentum toward peace\n\nI should stop when Juan has a chance to respond or make a decision about what to do next.\n\nThe officer listens intently to every word. When you speak the Arabic greeting, something shifts in his face—surprise first, then something warmer. Respect, perhaps.\n\nHe's silent for a long moment after you finish, clearly weighing what you've said. Behind him, the argument at the gate has continued, but some of those involved have stopped shouting and are straining to hear.\n\n\"Salaam aleikum, Your Majesty,\" he finally responds, and this time there's genuine warmth in it. \"You show respect we...\" He pauses, choosing words carefully. \"We did not expect from a Christian king.\"\n\nHe turns slightly, raising his voice so those at the gate can hear: \"You hear this? Banners intact. Safe conduct under the King's word. No forced conversions. Those who wish to leave may leave with honor. Those who wish to stay may stay in their homes.\"\n\nThe effect is immediate. Several of the officers who were arguing stop. One steps forward from the gate—a younger captain, perhaps thirty. \"These are the terms?\" he calls to the senior officer. \"Truly?\"\n\n\"Truly. I heard them from his own mouth.\"\n\nThe young captain turns to someone still inside—you can't see who—and speaks rapidly in Arabic. His tone is urgent, pleading. Another voice responds angrily, but less certainly than before.\n\nThe senior officer turns back to you. \"Your Majesty, these terms are more than honor demands. More than we feared to hope for.\" He gestures toward the massive breach in the wall. \"You could storm that gap. You have thirteen thousand troops. We have perhaps six hundred fifty left after the sortie. You could take this fortress in an afternoon and be within your rights.\"\n\nHis voice drops slightly. \"Instead you offer us dignity. Safety for our families. The choice to stay or go.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"This is the mercy we heard about from the other fortresses. Some of us believed it. Others...\" He glances back at the gate. \"Others said it was Christian lies to weaken our resolve.\"\n\nFrom the gate, more movement. Three more officers emerge—clearly having made a decision to come forward and hear for themselves. They approach cautiously, stopping beside the senior officer. One is the young captain who spoke earlier. The other two are older, harder-looking men.\n\nThe young captain addresses you directly, his Castilian rougher than the senior officer's: \"Your Majesty, you swear this? By your God? No harm to families? No forced baptisms?\"\n\n\"By Almighty God,\" you confirm. \"Those who wish to keep their faith may do so.\"\n\nThe young captain's shoulders sag with visible relief. He turns to one of the harder-looking officers and speaks in rapid Spanish: \"You hear? Our children safe. Our wives safe. We can leave with honor, or stay in our homes. What more can we ask?\"\n\nThe harder officer—a scarred veteran of perhaps fifty—responds grudgingly: \"And what of Sultan Yusuf? We swore oaths to defend this fortress.\"\n\n\"The Sultan cannot save us!\" the young captain snaps back. \"Look at that breach! Look at those bombards! We've done our duty! We held for a week against the entire Castilian army! No one can say we didn't fight!\"\n\nThe senior officer who first emerged raises a hand, calming them. He turns to you. \"Your Majesty, I believe you speak truth. I have heard of your mercy at Sanlúcar, at Málaga. You kept your word there.\" He draws a breath. \"I will urge our commander to accept these terms. I believe—I hope—he will agree.\"\n\nBehind him, more officers have gathered at the gate. Perhaps a dozen now, clearly listening. The arguments continue but they're different now—less about whether to trust you, more about logistics and honor and how to present this to the garrison.\n\nThe scarred veteran speaks again, his voice still doubtful but less hostile: \"If we accept, when would we leave? How long do we have to prepare?\"\n\nThe senior officer looks to you questioningly—that detail wasn't specified.\n\nFrom inside the gate, you hear a new voice—deeper, commanding. Arabic words that silence the other conversations. The officers at the gate immediately straighten, turn. Someone important is coming.\n\nThe senior officer glances back, then at you. \"Your Majesty, that is our commander—Qaid Hamza ibn Fadil. He's coming to hear your terms himself.\"\n\nA moment later, a man in his late fifties emerges from the gate. His armor is finer than the others', his bearing unmistakably that of command. His face is weathered, hard, but his eyes are intelligent and measuring. He walks forward with dignity until he stands beside the senior officer.\n\nHe studies you in silence for a long moment. Then, in clear if heavily accented Castilian: \"I am Qaid Hamza, commander of this fortress. I have held Íllora for Sultan Yusuf ibn Nasr for twenty-three years.\" His voice is firm, proud. \"Your bombards have broken my walls. Your army surrounds me. My men are divided—some wish to fight, some wish to surrender, all are afraid.\"\n\nHe pauses, jaw tight. \"I heard your terms from inside. Banners intact, safe conduct, no forced conversions, choice to stay or leave.\" Another pause. \"Are these truly your terms? Or do you say them now and change them once my gates are open?\"\n\nThe success of your offer hangs on this moment—on whether this commander believes you.\n\nWhat do you say to Qaid Hamza?"

Let me create the table.\n\nI'll evaluate how Juan's response lands with Qaid Hamza and create a d100 persuasion table.\n\nJUAN'S RESPONSE TO QAID HAMZA - ANALYSIS\n\nSuccess Factors in Juan's Response (exist regardless of roll):\n\nDirect, simple affirmation: No evasion or complexity\n\nPersonal character reference: Appeals to shared values (honesty, justice, fairness)\n\nUniversal virtues framing: Values that transcend religious divide\n\nWife's prayers mentioned: Humanizes you, shows family devotion\n\n\"God's children\" theology: Common ground between faiths\n\n\"Honourable men\" acknowledgment: Validates their resistance\n\nLight humor: Shows confidence without cruelty, lacks hatred\n\nAll previous success factors: Breach, reputation, specific terms, track record\n\nFailure Factors in Juan's Response (exist regardless of roll):\n\nEmphasis on \"Christian virtues\": Might feel like religious superiority\n\nHumor could land wrong: Might seem cavalier about their defeat/loss\n\nStill means surrender: No escaping the fundamental reality\n\nTrust barrier persists: Words vs. actions once gates open\n\nProfessional pride wounded: They're losing their fortress\n\nSultan's authority: Direct violation of oaths\n\n\"Fight again\" implies future conflict: Not necessarily comforting\n\nAll previous failure factors: Subjugation, exile, cultural fears\n\nD100 TABLE: QAID HAMZA'S RESPONSE\n\n1-10: OFFENDED REJECTION\nThe humor lands badly. Hamza's face hardens. \"'Fight again in years to come'? You mock our defeat, Christian king.\" Your success factors exist—he heard the terms, acknowledges your reputation—but the ending felt dismissive of their honor and sacrifice. \"These may be sincere terms, but I will not surrender to someone who treats our loss as a jest. We will defend this fortress. If you want it, storm that breach.\" Pride wounded, trust broken. The hardliners rally around him. Your offer failed.\n\n11-22: RIGID HONOR REFUSAL\nHamza listens to everything, clearly weighing it. Your values are acknowledged—\"You speak of honor, justice. Perhaps you mean them\"—but duty overwhelms. \"I have held this fortress for twenty-three years. I swore oaths to my Sultan. Your terms are generous, but I cannot break faith, no matter the cost.\" He's not angry, just immovable. The success factors are real to him, but military honor demands resistance. \"I will die at my post, Your Majesty. That is what honor requires of me.\" His officers look stricken but won't contradict him.\n\n23-35: SUSPICIOUS RESISTANCE\n\"Christian virtues.\" Hamza repeats the phrase flatly. \"You speak of God's children, but Christians have slaughtered Muslims for centuries in this land. Why should I believe you're different?\" Your terms are heard, your reputation acknowledged, but the trust barrier is too high. \"Words are easy before gates open. Actions after are what matter. I've seen too many promises broken.\" He shakes his head. \"I cannot risk my people on Christian promises, however sincere they sound.\" The fears overwhelm the facts.\n\n36-48: DEEPLY CONFLICTED\nHamza is silent for a long time, face working through emotions. \"Your terms are good. Your reputation suggests honesty. Your wife prays for us?\" A slight softening. \"This is more humanity than expected.\" But then he looks back at his fortress, his men. \"Yet I have duties. Oaths. Twenty-three years holding this fortress.\" He's genuinely torn—success factors pulling him toward acceptance, failure factors toward resistance. \"I need time. To pray. To consult. To think on this.\" Not rejection, but not acceptance. Paralyzed by conflicting obligations.\n\n49-60: CAUTIOUS OPENING\nThe humor catches him off-guard. His stern expression cracks slightly—not quite a smile, but close. \"Fight again in years to come? Insh'allah, if Allah wills, perhaps as allies rather than enemies.\" Your approach has created an opening. \"Your Majesty, I've fought Christians for decades. Few speak as you do—of honor, of God's children, of avoiding killing when possible.\" He studies you carefully. \"I believe you mean these terms. But I must protect my people. Give me assurances—written guarantees, hostages perhaps, time to organize—and I think we can reach agreement.\"\n\n61-72: GROWING RESPECT AND CONSIDERATION\nHamza's expression softens noticeably. \"Your wife prays for us? For Muslims she has never met?\" He seems genuinely moved by that detail. \"This speaks to character, Your Majesty.\" He glances at the breach, at your army, then back to you. \"You could storm that gap and be within your rights. Instead you stand here speaking of honesty and fairness and God's children.\" He turns to his officers. \"He offers what we hoped for. Honor. Safety. Choice.\" Back to you: \"I'm inclined to accept, Your Majesty. Your actions match your words at other fortresses. Give me tonight to speak with my men, to make this decision properly, and I believe we will open these gates tomorrow.\"\n\n73-83: STRONG ACCEPTANCE\nThe light humor actually works. Hamza's face relaxes and he does smile slightly. \"Fight again? Perhaps. Or perhaps work together someday.\" Your approach has disarmed him completely. \"Your Majesty, you speak with a soldier's honesty. I appreciate that.\" He looks at his gathered officers. \"We've held with honor. We've fought well. But the King offers good terms—better than we deserve after making him siege us for a week.\" He extends his hand toward you—not quite close enough to shake, but a gesture. \"I accept your terms. We will surrender the fortress. Give us two days to organize departure for those leaving, and this fortress is yours peacefully.\"\n\n84-92: GRATEFUL RELIEF\nHamza's stern facade cracks entirely. \"Your Majesty... your wife prays for us?\" His voice catches slightly. \"In twenty-three years of war, no Christian has ever said such a thing to me.\" Your humanity has reached him completely. \"These terms—safety, honor, choice—this is mercy I didn't believe existed anymore. You could kill us all. Instead you offer us life.\" He turns to his men, switches to Arabic, and you hear emotion in his voice. Several officers are wiping their eyes. Back to you: \"We accept. All of it. Thank you, Your Majesty. You've proven that even in war, there can be honor and mercy.\"\n\n93-97: IMMEDIATE ACCEPTANCE WITH EMOTION\nHamza actually steps forward and extends his hand fully—offering to clasp yours in agreement. \"Your Majesty, you are unlike any Christian commander I've faced. Honesty, justice, fairness—you live these virtues, not just speak them.\" His eyes are bright. \"Your wife prays for enemies? God—Allah—sees such things. He knows hearts.\" He grips your hand if you take it. \"We surrender this fortress to you now. Today. The gates will open within the hour. You've shown us we can trust Christian mercy. That is a greater victory than any sword could win.\"\n\n98-100: TRANSFORMATION AND ALLIANCE\nSomething extraordinary happens. Hamza listens to your words and his entire posture changes. The humor about fighting again makes him laugh—actually laugh. \"Or perhaps not fight at all, Your Majesty. Perhaps serve together.\" He turns to his men and speaks rapidly in Arabic—and you see astonishment on their faces. Back to you: \"Your Majesty, you offer more than surrender terms. You offer dignity, respect, a future. Some of my men wish to take your safe conduct to Granada. But I...\" He pauses. \"I would consider remaining here as your vassal. A Muslim commander holding a Christian king's fortress—unusual, yes? But you speak of God's children. Perhaps there is a new way forward. Let us discuss this further.\"\n\nRoll your d100 to see how Qaid Hamza responds to Juan's words."

          "text": "A roll of 27 falls in the \"SUSPICIOUS RESISTANCE\" category (23-35). This means Hamza is suspicious and resistant, despite the good terms offered. The success factors are acknowledged but the trust barrier is too high. He's been at war with Christians for decades and doesn't believe promises will be kept after gates open.\n\nI need to show:\n1. Hamza hearing the terms and acknowledging they sound good\n2. But fixating on \"Christian virtues\" as a point of suspicion\n3. Historical mistrust overwhelming the logical factors\n4. Reference to broken promises in the past\n5. Him unable to risk his people on promises\n6. This creates a problem - the negotiation has stalled\n\nI should stop when Juan has a chance to respond or make a decision about what to do next.\n\nQaid Hamza's face remains hard as stone. He repeats two of your words slowly, testing them: \"Christian virtues.\"\n\nThe phrase hangs in the air between you.\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks of honesty, justice, fairness as Christian virtues.\" His tone is carefully neutral, but there's an edge beneath it. \"For twenty-three years I have held this fortress. In those twenty-three years, I have seen Christian armies burn Muslim villages. I have seen promises of safe conduct broken. I have seen families slaughtered after surrender.\"\n\nHe's not shouting. His voice is level, controlled. But the words cut.\n\n\"You speak of your wife's prayers. Of God's children. Of valuing honesty.\" He gestures toward the breach in his wall. \"These are good words. Your terms sound fair. Your reputation—yes, we have heard of Sanlúcar, of Málaga. We know you offered mercy there and kept your word.\"\n\nA pause. His officers watch him intently.\n\n\"But words are spoken before gates open, Your Majesty. What matters is what happens after.\" His jaw tightens. \"Once my men lay down their arms, once the civilians are defenseless, once your soldiers enter these streets—what then? Will you still speak of Christian virtues when your troops see Muslim gold? When they see our women? When they remember brothers who died in the fighting?\"\n\nThe young captain who spoke earlier looks stricken. The senior officer's face is carefully blank. They're hearing their commander articulate fears they all share.\n\nHamza continues, his voice growing harder: \"I have lived through four decades of war in this land. I have seen too many promises broken to risk my people on Christian assurances, however sincere they may sound from a king's lips.\"\n\nHe looks directly at you, and there's no hostility in his eyes—just deep, weary suspicion born of experience.\n\n\"Perhaps you truly mean what you say. Perhaps you are different from other Christian commanders. But I cannot know this until it's too late to matter.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"I cannot risk six hundred fifty soldiers and three thousand civilians on hope that you are the first Christian king in my lifetime to keep his word once he has what he wants.\"\n\nBehind him, several of his officers shift uncomfortably. The young captain opens his mouth as if to speak, then closes it. They heard your terms. They want to believe. But their commander's mistrust is anchored in decades of bitter history.\n\nHamza straightens. \"I thank you for the offer, Your Majesty. It was more than many would give. But I cannot accept it.\" His voice is final. \"We will continue to defend this fortress. If you want Íllora, you must take it by storm. At least then my men die with weapons in hand, knowing what fate they chose.\"\n\nHe begins to turn back toward the gate.\n\nThe senior officer beside him looks anguished—torn between loyalty to his commander and the desire to accept your terms. The young captain's face shows open dismay. Other officers exchange desperate glances.\n\nBut Hamza is their commander, and he's decided.\n\nWhat do you do?"

          "text": "Hamza stops mid-stride. Your words—\"One of us will soon face judgement\"—hang in the air like a pronouncement.\n\nHe turns back slowly, his face suddenly very tired. For a moment, the hard commander's mask slips and you see an old man who has fought too many wars. \"Insh'allah,\" he says quietly. \"As God wills.\"\n\nThen the mask returns. He inclines his head in a gesture that's almost respectful—warrior acknowledging warrior—and walks back through the gate.\n\nBut as he passes his officers, you see the young captain grab his arm. Urgent words in Arabic. Hamza shakes him off, keeps walking. The senior officer calls after him—pleading tone clear even without understanding the words. Hamza doesn't stop.\n\nThe officers stand frozen at the gate, watching their commander disappear into the fortress. Several turn to look at you—faces showing conflict, desperation, anger at their commander's choice. The young captain actually takes a step toward you, as if to say something, then stops. His shoulders slump in defeat.\n\nThe gate begins to close. Slowly, with a grinding finality.\n\nYou turn and walk back toward your lines, the truce banner still held high behind you. Your household guard falls in around you—García's face is grim, Fernando's hand rests on his sword hilt.\n\nAs you reach your siege lines, the Master of Calatrava is waiting. He takes one look at your face and knows.\n\n\"They refused?\"\n\n\"They refused.\"\n\nHe nods slowly, unsurprised. \"Some men can't be saved from themselves.\" He turns to the assembled officers who've gathered. \"Pass the word. Assault at dawn tomorrow. Full attack through the breach. No quarter for those who resist.\"\n\nThe orders spread through the camp like ripples in dark water. You hear the change in sound—conversations becoming more urgent, weapons being sharpened, armor checked, priests beginning to move among the troops hearing confessions.\n\nAssault Preparations - Evening of April 6th\n\nYour command tent fills with officers as night falls. Maps are spread across the table. The breach is marked clearly—forty feet wide, accessible, death waiting beyond it.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava outlines the plan: \"Three assault columns. First wave—five hundred heavy infantry through the breach, shields locked, push through whatever barricades they've built behind it. Second wave—five hundred more to exploit and widen. Third wave—cavalry to sweep through once we're inside the town.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo adds: \"They'll have concentrated their defense at the breach. Expect barricades, possibly fire positions, desperate men. The town fighting will be room to room, bloody work.\"\n\nPietro reports on the artillery: \"I can bombard for two more hours at first light—target the area just behind the breach, try to disrupt their defensive positions. Then your infantry goes in.\"\n\nExpected casualties are discussed grimly. Fifty to a hundred dead, twice that wounded—conservative estimates for storming a prepared breach against desperate defenders.\n\nA captain asks: \"Your Majesty, do we offer quarter once we're inside? Or is it total assault?\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava looks to you. \"That's your decision, Your Majesty. You offered mercy. They refused. By the laws of siege, we're entitled to storm and sack.\"\n\nOutside your tent, you can hear the sounds of an army preparing for battle. Weapons testing, armor clanking, priests intoning prayers. Thirteen thousand men getting ready to kill and die come morning.\n\nThe war-weary troops you addressed at Niebla—the ones who gave you only grudging acceptance—are now being asked to storm a fortified breach. Some will not see tomorrow's sunset.\n\nWhat are your final orders before the assault?"

          "text": "1-8: CATASTROPHIC FAILURE\nThe assault goes disastrously wrong. Defenders have prepared the breach better than expected—oil, fire, collapsing rubble traps. First wave is devastated before even entering. Panic spreads. Officers lose control briefly. Moorish sortie from secondary gate hits flanks. By the time you restore order and withdraw, 150-200 of your men are dead, 250+ wounded. Garrison holds firm. Morale strengthened by their success. Need to completely rethink approach. Weeks more siege work needed.\n\n9-16: SEVERE SETBACK\nBreach assault bogs down in brutal fighting. Defenders have layered barricades behind the gap—your troops fight for every foot. Casualties mount quickly in the chokepoint. After three hours of savage combat, you control the breach but haven't broken into the town proper. 100-130 dead, 180-220 wounded. Garrison still fighting effectively. Will take another full assault tomorrow to break through. Your troops are shaken by the resistance.\n\n17-25: HEAVY CASUALTIES - SLOW PROGRESS\nThe assault succeeds but at terrible cost. Defenders fight desperately at every barricade. Room-to-room combat in the town is nightmarish. Takes until mid-afternoon to secure the town walls. Garrison retreats to the castle with perhaps 400 men still fighting. 80-100 of your troops dead, 150-180 wounded. Now face siege of inner castle with reduced, exhausted forces. Victory but pyrrhic.\n\n26-36: DIFFICULT URBAN COMBAT\nBreach is stormed successfully after fierce fighting. Town combat is brutal—defenders contest every street, every building. Some surrender when cornered, others fight to death. By evening you control the town but at cost: 60-75 dead, 120-140 wounded. Garrison remnant (300 troops) has barricaded in castle, preparing final stand. Civilians caught in fighting—despite orders, some casualties inevitable. Grim victory.\n\n37-48: HARD-FOUGHT SUCCESS\nStandard difficult assault. Breach fighting is intense but your numbers tell. Town is secured by afternoon through methodical clearing. Defenders split—some surrender when offered quarter, others fight on. Garrison commander Hamza retreats to castle with 200-250 loyalists. Your casualties: 45-55 dead, 90-110 wounded. Castle will require another siege or negotiation. Town secure but battered. Mixed success.\n\n49-60: PROFESSIONAL ASSAULT\nWell-executed attack. Bombardment disrupts defenders effectively before assault. Breach is taken in two hours of hard fighting. Town clearing proceeds methodically—your discipline holds, quarter is offered and many accept. Hamza retreats to castle with perhaps 150 loyalists. Casualties: 30-40 dead, 60-80 wounded. Town secured, civilians mostly protected. Now must deal with castle holdouts. Solid military success.\n\n61-71: EFFECTIVE BREAKTHROUGH\nExcellent assault execution. Pre-dawn bombardment devastates defensive positions. First wave takes breach with minimal resistance. Town fighting sees substantial surrenders—perhaps 250 garrison troops lay down arms when quarter offered. Hamza and 100 hardliners barricade in castle. Your casualties light: 20-28 dead, 45-60 wounded. Civilian casualties minimal due to good discipline. Strong success—most garrison captured alive, town intact.\n\n72-81: GARRISON FRACTURING\nAssault begins, but garrison cohesion breaks immediately. Divided command from yesterday's argument becomes total breakdown. Whole sections surrender as you enter. Hamza and perhaps 60 loyalists fight running battle to castle, but 400+ garrison troops surrender throughout the morning. Fighting is brief and localized. Your casualties: 12-18 dead, 30-40 wounded. Town secured by noon with minimal damage. Excellent outcome.\n\n82-89: RAPID COLLAPSE\nThe assault barely begins before white flags appear on multiple positions. Last night's refusal created crisis—officers and troops override Hamza's decision. Young captain you saw yesterday leads surrender delegation at dawn. \"Our commander chose death. We choose life.\" Hamza and 30-40 diehards barricade in castle tower, but rest of garrison surrenders en masse. Your casualties: 5-8 dead from brief fighting, 10-15 wounded. Town falls peacefully. Outstanding success.\n\n90-95: LAST-MINUTE SURRENDER\nAt dawn, before bombardment begins, gates open. Senior officer from yesterday emerges with white flag. \"Commander Hamza was overruled by his captains during the night. We surrender the fortress on the terms you offered yesterday.\" Internal mutiny—garrison refused to die for Hamza's mistrust. Commander himself is brought out in custody by his own men. Zero assault casualties. Complete peaceful surrender. Total strategic success.\n\n96-100: HAMZA'S CHANGE OF HEART\nHour before dawn, messenger arrives at your tent. Hamza requests parley. At first light, he emerges alone from gate. \"Your Majesty, I spent the night in prayer. My mistrust was sin—seeing evil where there was mercy. God sent a dream showing me your wife truly does pray for us, that you truly are different.\" Tears in his eyes. \"I surrender Íllora completely. Please forgive an old warrior's stubbornness.\" Full peaceful surrender, garrison intact, Hamza himself repentant. Miraculous resolution.\n\nRoll your d100 to see the outcome of the assault on Íllora."

          "text": "THE ASSAULT ON ÍLLORA\n\nApril 7, 1432\n\nPre-Dawn: The Final Bombardment\n\nYou stand in the darkness before dawn, watching Pietro's crews make their final preparations. The five bombards are loaded and ready, positioned to fire on the area immediately behind the breach where intelligence suggests the defenders have built their main barricades.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava stands beside you, silent. Behind you in the darkness, five hundred heavy infantry wait in formation—the first assault wave. You can hear their breathing, the quiet clink of armor as men shift nervously, whispered prayers.\n\nThe sky begins to lighten in the east. Pietro looks to you.\n\nYou nod.\n\n\"FIRE!\"\n\nThe five guns roar as one. A wall of sound and smoke. The stone balls arc into the breach area, striking whatever defensive works lie beyond. Dust and debris fly up. You hear distant screams—men caught by the bombardment.\n\nReload. Fire again. And again.\n\nFor two hours, the bombardment continues. Systematic destruction of whatever awaits your troops inside. By the time the sun crests the horizon, Pietro's crews have fired over thirty shots into the breach zone.\n\n\"As ready as they'll ever be,\" Pietro says grimly.\n\nThe assault troops move forward.\n\nDawn: The Breach\n\nThe first wave advances through the forty-foot gap in disciplined formation—shields locked, infantry moving as one mass. You watch from a command position three hundred yards back as they enter the breach.\n\nFor a moment, nothing. Then the sound reaches you—a roar of combat. Steel on steel, screams, the crash of collapsing timber.\n\nThe defenders are there. Waiting behind the rubble.\n\nThe first wave disappears into the breach. The second wave follows. Then nothing but the sounds of fighting—muffled by distance and stone, but unmistakable. Minutes pass. The noise intensifies.\n\nA runner staggers back through the breach, blood streaming from a head wound. He finds the Master of Calatrava: \"Barricades! Layered defenses! They're fighting for every foot!\"\n\nMore troops are fed into the breach. The third wave. Then reserve forces. The fighting at the breach continues for over an hour before the first Castilian banners appear on the town walls flanking the gap—signal that the initial position is secured.\n\nBut the cost is already apparent. Bodies are being carried back. Many bodies.\n\nMorning: The Town\n\nWhat follows is nightmare.\n\nThe garrison isn't surrendering. They're contesting every street, every building, every corner of Íllora. Your troops advance through the town in brutal house-to-house fighting—kicking in doors, clearing rooms, fighting in narrow alleys where armor counts for everything.\n\nSome defenders surrender when cornered—perhaps eighty men total throw down their weapons when offered quarter, and they're hustled to the rear as prisoners. But most fight on with desperate ferocity.\n\nThe casualties mount.\n\nA captain is killed by an arrow fired from a second-story window. Six soldiers die clearing a barricaded warehouse. A squad is caught in an ambush in a narrow street—only two survive. The field hospital behind your lines fills rapidly with wounded men—sword cuts, arrow wounds, crushed limbs from collapsed buildings.\n\nYour troops maintain discipline despite the horror. Rape and murder are not tolerated—officers enforce your orders strictly. But the fighting itself is savage beyond words. This is urban combat against men who have chosen death.\n\nBy noon, you control perhaps half the town. By early afternoon, three-quarters. The defenders are being compressed back toward the castle at the town's highest point.\n\nThe butcher's bill keeps growing.\n\nMid-Afternoon: The Castle\n\nBy three hours past noon, your forces have secured the town walls completely. The last pockets of resistance in the streets have been eliminated or surrendered. But atop the hill at the town's center, Íllora's castle still holds.\n\nQaid Hamza and perhaps four hundred of his garrison have retreated there—barricading themselves inside the stone keep and refusing all calls for surrender. Your troops surround it but are too exhausted to immediately assault. They've been fighting for eight hours straight.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava reports to you in the captured town square, his armor splashed with blood—not his own.\n\n\"The town is ours, Your Majesty. But that castle...\" He gestures up at the defiant structure. \"Hamza is inside with everyone who wouldn't surrender. They've barricaded the gates, posted archers at every window. We'd need to either starve them out or storm it, and after today...\" He doesn't finish.\n\nThe casualty reports arrive throughout the afternoon, compiled from captains' tallies:\n\nDead: 87 soldiers killed\n\n34 in the initial breach assault\n\n41 in the town fighting\n\n12 in various ambushes and building clearances\n\nWounded: 164 soldiers wounded\n\n52 seriously (may not return to duty)\n\n112 walking wounded (can recover)\n\nEnemy casualties:\n\nApproximately 150-180 Moorish soldiers killed in the fighting\n\n80 captured who surrendered when offered quarter\n\n400± still alive in the castle with Hamza\n\nThe town itself is battered. Buildings damaged by fighting, some burned. Civilian casualties—despite your orders and your troops' discipline—are inevitable in urban combat. Perhaps twenty to thirty townspeople killed in crossfire or collapsed structures. The survivors huddle in their homes, terrified.\n\nEvening: The Grim Reality\n\nYou tour the town as evening falls, García and your household guard around you. The streets are littered with debris—broken weapons, blood stains, bodies being collected for burial. Your soldiers sit exhausted against walls, too tired to even remove their armor.\n\nIn the makeshift field hospital, surgeons work by torchlight. You stop to speak with the wounded—young men with terrible injuries, some crying out in pain, others eerily quiet. One soldier grabs your hand: \"We took it, Your Majesty. We took it.\" He's missing his left arm below the elbow.\n\n\"You did,\" you tell him. \"You did well.\"\n\nOutside, you find the Master of Calatrava staring up at the castle. Torches illuminate its walls. Hamza's green banner still flies from the keep.\n\n\"Eighty-seven dead,\" the Master says quietly. \"For a town we could have had yesterday without a drop of blood.\" No accusation in his voice—just stating fact. \"And we're not done. That castle still holds four hundred men who won't surrender.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo joins you. \"The troops are spent, Your Majesty. They fought brilliantly today, but they're exhausted. If we have to storm that castle tomorrow...\" He shakes his head. \"More will die. Many more.\"\n\nPietro approaches with his report: \"The bombards can target the castle, Your Majesty. But it's solid construction, smaller target than the town walls. Could take a week to breach, and we're exposed here—still in Granada's territory with enemies all around.\"\n\nFrom the castle above, you hear sounds—men moving on the walls, preparing defenses. Hamza chose this. Chose death over trust. And eighty-seven of your soldiers paid for his choice.\n\nYour war-weary troops—the ones who gave you only grudging acceptance at Niebla—have now been through a day of hell. Some won't fight again. Some won't survive their wounds. All of them will remember Íllora.\n\nThe castle looms above you in the gathering darkness, defiant still.\n\nWhat do you do?"

          "text": "The Master of Calatrava nods. \"Sensible. They've earned rest.\" He begins issuing orders immediately.\n\nEvening into Night: The Rotation\n\nThe exhausted assault troops are pulled back from the castle perimeter in organized withdrawal. They move like old men—shoulders slumped, weapons dragging, some helping wounded comrades. Many have been fighting since dawn, over twelve hours of brutal combat.\n\nAs they file past your position in the town square, you see their faces. Blood-spattered, hollow-eyed, some still shaking from battle-shock. A sergeant salutes as his company passes—his arm trembles with exhaustion. \"Your Majesty,\" he manages, then keeps walking.\n\nThey're directed to bivouac areas in the lower town, away from the castle. Food is distributed—men eat mechanically, too tired to taste it. Wine is rationed out. Chaplains move among them, offering comfort. The wounded are carried to the field hospital where surgeons continue their grim work by torchlight.\n\nFresh troops move up to replace them—soldiers who spent the day in reserve positions, waiting. Five thousand men rotate into the perimeter around the castle, establishing siege lines, digging trenches, setting up barriers. These troops are rested, but they've watched their comrades fight all day. They know what they're facing.\n\nThe Bombard Positioning\n\nPietro Calabrese surveys the castle in the fading light, calculating angles and distances. \"More difficult than the town walls, Your Majesty. Smaller target, higher position, better construction. But it can be done.\"\n\nThe artillery teams begin the laborious process of moving the five bombards up through the captured town. Oxen strain to pull the massive guns up the narrow streets toward the castle. Crews clear rubble, build ramps over collapsed sections, curse when wheels stick in blood-slicked cobblestones.\n\nIt takes hours. Full darkness has fallen by the time the first bombard reaches an acceptable firing position—a small square two hundred yards from the castle gate. The other four are positioned throughout the night, crews working by torchlight.\n\nPietro sets up elaborate protective works again—gabions, mantlets, trenches for crew protection. \"They've got archers up there, and after today they know we're serious. I'm not losing guns or crews to harassing fire.\"\n\nBy midnight, all five bombards are in position. Loaded, aimed at the castle's main gate and the walls flanking it. Ready to fire on your command.\n\nThe Night Watch\n\nYou stand in the captured town square past midnight, unable to sleep. Around you, Íllora slowly settles into uneasy quiet. Your troops maintain watch. The wounded groan in the hospital. Somewhere, a soldier is quietly weeping.\n\nFrom the castle above, torches illuminate the walls. You can see defenders moving—preparing for tomorrow's bombardment. Hamza is up there somewhere, having watched his town fall, his garrison slaughtered, his people conquered. Still refusing to surrender.\n\nDon Rodrigo finds you. \"Your Majesty, you should rest. Tomorrow will be another long day.\"\n\n\"How many in that castle?\"\n\n\"Best estimate: four hundred fighting men. Plus perhaps fifty to a hundred civilians—servants, families of garrison officers who couldn't evacuate. They're trapped now.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava joins you, carrying a wineskin. He takes a drink and passes it to you. \"We paid a high price today. Eighty-seven dead. But the town is ours. The castle will fall too—it's only a matter of time. Hamza has no escape, no relief, no hope.\"\n\n\"He chose this,\" you say quietly.\n\n\"He did.\" The Master studies the castle. \"Question is how long he'll hold out. Days? Weeks? And how many more of our men die taking it?\"\n\nPietro approaches, wiping gun-oil from his hands. \"The bombards are ready, Your Majesty. I can start at dawn, but I'll be honest—that's solid masonry. Could take three to five days of continuous bombardment to create an assault-ready breach. Maybe longer if they make good repairs at night.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo adds: \"And we're exposed here. Still in Granada's territory. Every day we spend battering that castle is a day Sultan Yusuf could send relief forces, or hit our supply lines, or—\"\n\nA shout from the northern watch interrupts him. A sentry is pointing. You turn to look.\n\nOn the castle walls, torchlight illuminates a white cloth being raised. Not on the main tower—on a side tower. A surrender flag.\n\nBut it's lowered almost immediately. Shouting erupts from inside the castle—distant but audible. An argument. The white flag tries to go up again, is torn down again. More shouting.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava stares. \"They're fighting among themselves. Some want to surrender, others refuse.\"\n\nYou watch the castle for another ten minutes. The argument continues—you can hear it echoing off stone walls even at this distance. No more surrender flags appear, but the discord inside is obvious.\n\n\"Hamza is losing control,\" Don Rodrigo observes. \"After watching us take the town today, some of his men want out.\"\n\nDawn is perhaps five hours away. Your bombards sit loaded and ready. Your fresh troops surround the castle. Inside, four hundred men and innocent civilians are trapped with a commander who chose death over mercy.\n\nWhat do you command?"

Hamza maintains iron discipline despite opposition. Three days of bombardment create only minor damage. On Day 4, rather than wait for breach, Hamza leads desperate sortie—200 men charge from castle in suicidal attack. Fierce fighting kills 45 more of your troops before sortie is annihilated. Hamza dies fighting. Remaining 200 garrison members finally surrender after their commander's death. Total additional casualties: 60+ dead, 80+ wounded. Week-long brutal siege.\n\n6-12: PROTRACTED RESISTANCE\nCastle is tougher than expected. Five days of bombardment to create marginal breach. Internal divisions persist but Hamza keeps control through force of will and executions of \"defeatists.\" Finally on Day 6, breach is assault-ready. Storm the castle—desperate final fighting kills 35 more of your troops, 150+ defenders. Hamza killed in fighting. Final 100 garrison surrenders. Civilians caught in crossfire—20-30 dead. Additional casualties: 50 dead, 70 wounded. Pyrrhic victory.\n\n13-22: DIFFICULT SIEGE\nFour days of bombardment. Castle walls crack but slowly. Internal arguments continue—you hear shouting every night, see occasional scuffles on walls. Day 4: Major breach opens. Before you can assault, white flags appear—officers have imprisoned Hamza and surrender castle. But damage done: bombardment killed 15 civilians in collapse, garrison demoralized but still 380 alive. Additional casualties: 8 dead from harassing fire during siege. Week lost.\n\n23-35: GRINDING SIEGE\nThree days of steady bombardment. Walls show serious damage. Internal discord intensifies—two mutiny attempts against Hamza that you can observe from outside, both suppressed. Day 3 evening: Major wall collapse creates breach. Night before assault, officers finally overthrow Hamza (imprisoned, not killed). Surrender at dawn Day 4. Castle battered, 10 civilians dead from bombardment. Garrison intact (400 troops). Additional casualties: 5 dead from harassing arrows. Four days lost.\n\n36-48: SLOW CRUMBLING\nTwo days bombardment creates significant damage. Internal divisions visible daily—arguments on walls, factions forming. Day 2 evening: Group of 60 soldiers lowers themselves from walls on ropes, surrenders to your lines. \"We won't die for Hamza's pride.\" Day 3 morning: Before bombardment resumes, senior officers send delegation—they've removed Hamza from command (under arrest). Negotiate surrender. Castle damaged but serviceable. 340 troops surrender. Additional casualties: 3 dead from harassing fire. Three days lost, but clean resolution.\n\n49-60: EFFECTIVE PRESSURE\nBombardment begins effectively. Day 1: Significant wall damage. That night: Major internal confrontation—you hear fighting inside castle. Day 2 morning: White flag. Officers present Hamza in chains. \"He would have killed us all. We choose life.\" Castle moderately damaged, garrison intact (395 troops, 5 killed in internal fighting). Civilians safe. Additional casualties: 2 dead from arrows. Two days lost. Good outcome given circumstances.\n\n61-72: RAPID RESOLUTION\nBombardment starts at dawn. By noon, serious wall damage visible. That afternoon: White flag. Delegation emerges—\"Commander Hamza has been relieved of command by his officers. We surrender the castle on yesterday's terms.\" Internal coup happened overnight after watching bombardment begin. Hamza imprisoned by his own men. Castle lightly damaged. Full garrison surrenders (400 troops). Zero additional casualties. Two days total. Clean military success.\n\n73-82: QUICK COLLAPSE\nFirst bombardment volley at dawn causes spectacular damage—wall section proves weaker than expected, major crack appears. Immediate crisis inside castle. By mid-morning: Gates open, white flags everywhere. Officers drag Hamza out in chains. \"We won't die for his mistrust.\" Immediate complete surrender. Castle minimally damaged. Full garrison intact. Zero additional casualties. One day. Excellent outcome.\n\n84-90: OVERNIGHT MUTINY\nYou order bombardment to begin at dawn. But at 3 AM, hours before dawn, your sentries report: castle gates opening. Officers emerge with white flags and Hamza as prisoner. \"Your Majesty, we imprisoned our commander after midnight. We witnessed today's slaughter. We will not repeat it. The castle is yours.\" Complete overnight mutiny. Zero bombardment needed. Zero additional casualties. Immediate surrender. Outstanding success.\n\n91-96: HAMZA OVERTHROWN AT MIDNIGHT\nShortly after midnight, before you even sleep, urgent word from sentries: delegation approaching from castle under white flag. Senior officers—including the young captain from yesterday. \"We've arrested Commander Hamza. His officers voted unanimously to remove him. We surrender Íllora castle and request the terms you offered yesterday.\" Internal revolution happened within hours of town falling. Zero bombardment. Zero additional casualties. Complete peaceful resolution.\n\n97-100: HAMZA'S REVELATION\n2 AM: Messenger from castle requests immediate parley. At dawn, gates open—Hamza himself emerges, alone, unarmed. Falls to his knees before you. \"Your Majesty, I watched my town burn because of my pride. I heard my men dying because of my mistrust. God has shown me my sin. I was wrong. Completely wrong. I surrender everything. Please, show the mercy I should have accepted yesterday. Save what's left of my people.\" Broken, repentant, surrendering completely. Zero additional casualties.

Some civilian casualties from the bombardment. 5 more Castilian casualties from harassing fire during the siege.\n\nI need to narrate this in detail, showing:\n- The bombardment beginning at dawn Day 1\n- The steady damage over three days\n- The visible internal discord and mutiny attempts\n- Hamza suppressing them\n- Day 3 evening major collapse\n- That night, officers finally overthrow Hamza\n- Day 4 dawn surrender\n- The cost: 10 civilians dead, 5 more soldiers dead\n- Total time lost: 4 days\n\nThis should be written as a grinding, difficult siege where Juan's decision not to offer terms first means they have to batter the castle for days, causing additional casualties on both sides, until the officers finally break and overthrow their commander.\n\nTHE SIEGE OF ÍLLORA CASTLE\n\nApril 8-11, 1432\n\nDay One: April 8 - The Bombardment Begins\n\nDawn breaks cold and clear. Pietro Calabrese makes his final checks on the gun positions, then looks to you.\n\n\"Fire.\"\n\nThe five bombards roar. Stone balls arc upward and slam into the castle walls with tremendous cracks. Dust and chips of stone fly. The noise echoes through the captured town.\n\nThe bombardment settles into its familiar rhythm. Fire, reload, fire. Every thirty minutes, another volley crashes into Hamza's castle. You're targeting the main gate and the walls flanking it—the same strategy that worked so devastatingly against the town walls.\n\nBut the castle is different. Thicker construction, better masonry, smaller target area. The damage accumulates slowly. By noon, after four volleys, the walls show impact marks but no serious structural damage. By evening, cracks are beginning to appear in the mortar, but nothing like the spectacular collapses you achieved against the town.\n\nAnd throughout the day, you can see the internal discord.\n\nMid-morning: An argument erupts on the castle walls—two groups of soldiers clearly shouting at each other. One group is pointing down at your bombards, gesturing urgently. The other group, led by what looks like senior officers, forces them back from the walls at sword-point.\n\nAfternoon: During reload, you see a scuffle break out on the southern tower. Perhaps a dozen men involved. It's brief—officers arrive and separate them—but the division is obvious even from two hundred yards away.\n\nEvening: As the day's bombardment ends, you hear shouting from inside the castle—loud enough to carry across the gap. Multiple voices, angry, overlapping. An argument that goes on for nearly an hour before finally subsiding.\n\nDon Rodrigo observes it all. \"They're tearing themselves apart in there. Some want to surrender. Hamza is keeping them in line, but barely.\"\n\nYour casualties for the day: Two soldiers wounded by arrows fired from the castle walls. Harassing fire, not serious, but a reminder that the defenders can still strike back.\n\nDay Two: April 9 - Intensifying Pressure\n\nThe second day brings more visible stress inside the castle.\n\nThe bombardment continues methodically. Pietro concentrates fire on a specific section of wall where yesterday's impacts weakened the structure. By noon, a visible crack runs vertically through the masonry—perhaps ten feet long. By evening, the crack has widened and lengthened. The wall is beginning to fail.\n\nBut the internal conflict is even more apparent.\n\nMorning: A group of perhaps twenty soldiers gathers on the walls, clearly arguing with officers. You can see them pointing at the damaged wall section, at your army, gesturing emphatically. For a moment it looks like they might actually charge the officers—but then a new figure appears. Even at this distance, you recognize the bearing: Qaid Hamza himself. He speaks briefly. The soldiers disperse immediately, heads down. Whatever he said, it worked.\n\nMidday: Another incident. A white cloth appears briefly on the eastern tower—someone trying to signal surrender. It's up for perhaps ten seconds before being ripped down violently. You see several soldiers dragged away by guards. Minutes later, you hear screams from inside the castle. Short, cut off abruptly.\n\nDon Rodrigo's face is grim. \"He's executing the ones who tried to surrender. Holding discipline through terror now.\"\n\nAfternoon: The most serious incident yet. Perhaps fifty soldiers gather in the castle's inner courtyard—visible from your elevated positions. They're clearly confronting officers. A full mutiny attempt. For tense minutes, it looks like it might succeed—swords are drawn, men shouting. Then Hamza appears again with what must be his most loyal troops. A brief, vicious fight. You see bodies fall. The mutineers break and scatter. Order is restored, but at the cost of Muslim blood spilling Muslim blood.\n\nBy evening's count: At least seven defenders dead in internal conflicts today. Your casualties: Three more soldiers wounded by arrows, one seriously.\n\nThat night, you hear sporadic shouting from the castle. The arguments continue, but more quietly now. Hamza has reasserted control, but the cracks are showing.\n\nDay Three: April 10 - The Breaking Point\n\nThe third day of bombardment brings the crisis.\n\nMorning bombardment continues the systematic destruction of the weakened wall section. The vertical crack is now a gaping fissure. Chunks of masonry are falling away. The wall is very close to catastrophic failure.\n\nInside the castle, an eerie quiet has fallen. No visible arguments. No scuffles. Just soldiers on the walls, watching the bombardment, waiting.\n\nDon Rodrigo finds it more unnerving than the previous days' chaos. \"They've stopped fighting each other. That means either Hamza has complete control again, or they're planning something.\"\n\nMidday: A woman appears on the walls—unusual enough to draw everyone's attention. She's screaming something in Arabic, pointing at the damaged wall, at your positions. An officer tries to pull her back. She fights him, still screaming. Finally, she's dragged away, still struggling.\n\n\"Civilian,\" the Master of Calatrava says quietly. \"Probably someone's wife or daughter. Terrified of what's coming when that wall falls.\"\n\nThe bombardment continues.\n\nThen, late afternoon—the moment Pietro has been working toward for three days.\n\nA volley strikes the compromised wall section. There's a long, grinding sound of stone on stone. The crack widens. And then, with a roar like distant thunder, an entire section of wall—twenty-five feet wide, reaching from foundation to battlements—simply collapses.\n\nThe crash is tremendous. Dust billows outward. When it clears, you're looking at a ragged breach in the castle wall. Not as wide or clean as the town wall breach, but absolutely passable. Inside, you can see into the castle's courtyard. Bodies lie in the rubble—people caught by the collapse.\n\nFrom inside the castle comes a sound you haven't heard before: wailing. Women's voices, high and keening. The civilians mourning their dead.\n\nPietro reports to you, face grim: \"That collapse killed people inside, Your Majesty. Civilians probably—wrong place, wrong time. Maybe ten, maybe more. Can't tell from here.\"\n\nYou watch the castle. Soldiers are rushing to the breach, trying to build hasty barricades. But their movements are panicked, disorganized. The collapse has shattered whatever discipline remained.\n\nAs evening falls, you give orders for the assault to begin at dawn. Five thousand troops are positioned, ready to storm that breach. The Master of Calatrava estimates casualties: \"Probably lower than the town assault. They're breaking already. Maybe twenty to thirty dead, assuming they fight at all.\"\n\nThat night, you try to sleep in a commandeered house in the upper town. The castle looms above in the darkness, torchlit and doomed.\n\nNight of April 10-11: The Final Mutiny\n\nAt midnight, you're awakened by urgent voices.\n\n\"Your Majesty! Your Majesty, wake up!\"\n\nIt's Don Rodrigo, breathless. \"The castle, Your Majesty. Something's happening.\"\n\nYou dress quickly and follow him outside. Even from the lower town, you can hear it: shouting from the castle. Not argument this time—fighting. The sound of steel on steel. Screams.\n\nYou race up through the captured town to your forward command position. The castle above is chaos—torchlight revealing struggling figures on the walls, in the courtyard. A full-scale internal battle.\n\n\"Civil war,\" the Master of Calatrava says, watching through a spyglass. \"The officers have finally turned on Hamza. I can see loyalists fighting rebels throughout the castle. It's a bloodbath up there.\"\n\nThe fighting continues for perhaps thirty minutes. Then, gradually, it dies down. A victor has emerged.\n\nSilence falls. You wait, watching.\n\nThen, in the darkness, the castle gates grind open.\n\nA torch-bearing delegation emerges, moving slowly down the hill toward your positions. Six men. As they approach, you see their condition: bloodied, exhausted, one limping badly. The young captain you saw three days ago is among them, blood on his sword and a cut across his face.\n\nThey stop at your forward positions. The senior officer from the first parley—the one who warned you of the division—steps forward. He looks like he's aged ten years.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, voice hoarse. \"Commander Qaid Hamza ibn Fadil has been relieved of command by his officers and placed under arrest.\" He pauses, swallows. \"We... we could not let him kill everyone. The wall fell. Civilians died. Tomorrow you would assault, and more would die. We...\" His voice breaks slightly. \"We had to stop him.\"\n\nThe young captain speaks up, voice shaking: \"He would have made us fight to the last man, Your Majesty. Die in that courtyard for his pride. After we saw what happened in the town yesterday... we couldn't. We wouldn't.\"\n\nThe senior officer steadies himself. \"We surrender Íllora castle. The garrison, the civilians, everything. On the terms you offered three days ago. We ask only...\" He hesitates. \"Commander Hamza is imprisoned but alive. We did not kill him, though some wanted to. What will be his fate?\"\n\nBehind them, through the open castle gates, you can see more soldiers gathering—watching, waiting to see if their mutiny and surrender will be accepted.\n\nWhat do you say?"

Perhaps two hundred of our garrison dead. Civilians killed in the collapse today.\" His jaw works. \"All because Commander Hamza could not trust Christian mercy.\"\n\nThe young captain's voice is raw: \"And we paid for his choice with our own blood. We killed our brothers tonight to stop him. Five more of our garrison dead in the fighting—men we served with for years. All to surrender anyway.\"\n\n\"But not on the same terms,\" the senior officer says quietly, turning back to you. \"Because we refused when we should have accepted. We understand, Your Majesty.\"\n\nHe looks at his fellow officers, then back to you. \"These terms—eleven may leave, the rest captured until the crusade ends, civilians protected, no forced conversions, Commander Hamza treated honorably. They are harder than we hoped but...\" He pauses. \"They are far better than we deserve after today.

You swear this?\"\n\n\"I give my word before God,\" you say firmly.\n\nHe nods slowly. \"Then... then at least they live. At least we all live.\" He looks back at the castle. \"Better captivity and eventual freedom than death at dawn.\"\n\nAnother officer in the delegation—older, harder—speaks for the first time: \"Your Majesty, I fought beside these men for twenty years. To leave them as prisoners while I go free...\" His voice catches. \"It feels like betrayal.\"\n\n\"Then stay with them,\" the senior officer tells him gently. \"The King offers eleven the chance to leave. He doesn't demand it. You can choose captivity with your comrades if honor requires it.\"\n\nThe older officer considers, then shakes his head. \"No. Someone must reach Granada. Must tell Sultan Yusuf what happened here. That the King of Castile keeps his word even when we do not. That mercy was offered and refused, and still he did not slaughter us when he could have.\" He looks at you. \"Perhaps there is hope for peace yet, if such men lead.\"\n\nThe senior officer draws himself up. \"Your Majesty, we accept your terms. All of them.\" He turns to the young captain. \"You should be one of the eleven who leave. You tried to surrender from the beginning. You led tonight's... action... against Commander Hamza. You deserve to survive this freely.\"\n\nThe young captain looks torn but finally nods.\n\nThe senior officer continues: \"I will stay with the garrison as prisoner. Someone must answer for tonight's bloodshed, and better me than these younger men.\" Before anyone can protest, he presses on: \"We will open the castle completely at dawn. The garrison—three hundred eighty-five troops still alive after tonight—will lay down their arms and accept captivity. The civilians will be gathered for your protection. Commander Hamza will be delivered to you in chains.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds quietly: \"Your Majesty, may I make one request? The five men who died tonight fighting beside Hamza, the loyalists who fell when we overthrew him—may we bury them properly before surrendering? They were wrong, but they were brave. They deserve that much.\"\n\nThe delegation waits for your response, bloodied and exhausted, knowing their mutiny has saved lives but cost them their freedom. Behind them, the castle stands silent in the darkness, waiting for dawn and surrender.\n\nWhat do you tell them?"

That may matter in the sieges to come.\"\n\nDay Four: April 11 - The Burials\n\nDawn breaks gray and somber. Throughout the captured town and in the castle above, both armies tend to their dead.\n\nThe Castilian Burials:\n\nIn the town square, your chaplains consecrate ground for a mass grave. Eighty-seven bodies are laid out in rows, washed and prepared. Many are young—boys who will never see home again. Each is wrapped in cloth, a cross placed on the chest.\n\nYou attend the funeral mass, standing among your soldiers as the chaplain intones the prayers for the dead. \"Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon them...\"\n\nThe names are read. Soldier after soldier. Some you remember from the assault—the young man with the neck wound who survived, only to die in the town fighting. The captain killed by an arrow. Men whose faces you saw in the pre-dawn darkness before the attack.\n\nThey're buried with honor. Wooden crosses mark the grave. The soldiers who fought beside them stand at attention, weapons held in salute.\n\nThe Moorish Burials:\n\nFrom your position, you can see activity in the castle courtyard. The Muslim garrison is conducting their own ceremonies—bodies wrapped in white cloth, prayers in Arabic carried on the morning wind, burials facing Mecca according to their customs.\n\nThey bury their combat dead first—the one hundred fifty-plus who fell defending the town. Then, separately, the five who died in last night's mutiny, loyalists who fought for Hamza to the end. Finally, with special care, the civilians killed when the wall collapsed—perhaps twelve souls, crushed by falling stone.\n\nDon Rodrigo watches through his spyglass. \"They're doing it properly. With dignity. Even for the men they killed themselves last night.\"\n\nThe burials take most of the morning. Both sides honoring their dead in their own ways.\n\nMidday: The Surrender\n\nAt noon, the castle gates open fully.\n\nThe garrison files out in formation—three hundred eighty-five men, unarmed, moving with whatever dignity defeat allows. They're led by the senior officer from last night's delegation. Behind them, civilians huddle together—women, children, old men, perhaps one hundred fifty souls looking terrified.\n\nYour troops line the path down from the castle, weapons held ready but not threatening. The Master of Calatrava has positioned guards to ensure discipline—no looting, no violence.\n\nThe garrison reaches the town square where you wait. They form up in ranks, stand at attention. The senior officer steps forward and formally surrenders his sword—offering it hilt-first.\n\nYou accept it, then hand it to Don Rodrigo. \"These men are prisoners of the Crown. They will be held at Antequera under guard until the crusade's end, then released as promised. They are to be treated fairly—adequate food, shelter, no mistreatment.\"\n\nThe senior officer translates for his men in Arabic. Visible relief passes through the ranks. They were clearly fearing worse.\n\nThen another group emerges from the castle—six guards escorting a man in chains. Qaid Hamza ibn Fadil.\n\nHe walks with dignity despite the chains, head high. When he reaches you, he stops but does not kneel. His face is hard, unreadable. For a long moment, you simply look at each other—the Christian king and the Muslim commander whose mistrust cost so much.\n\nFinally, Hamza speaks, his Castilian slow but clear: \"I was wrong, Your Majesty. I see that now. Too late, but I see it.\" His voice is flat, emotionless. \"I cost my garrison two hundred dead. I cost you eighty-seven. I cost my people their freedom. All because I could not trust the mercy you offered.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds quietly: \"History will remember me as the fool who refused what should have been accepted. May Allah forgive me. I do not expect you to.\"\n\nWhat do you say to Qaid Hamza?"

          "text": "Hamza looks at you for a long moment, something shifting in his weathered face. \"Go with God,\" he repeats quietly, as if testing the words. Then, more firmly: \"And may God be with you, King Juan. You are... not what I expected Christians to be.\"\n\nHe bows his head—not submission, but respect—and allows the guards to lead him away.\n\nThe garrison is formed into a column with civilian refugees under guard. Don Rodrigo assigns two hundred soldiers to escort them to Antequera—three days' march west. As they file out of the town, you see the young captain among the eleven who were allowed to leave freely. He pauses, looks back at his imprisoned comrades, then turns toward the road to Granada carrying his news.\n\nThe Recovery: April 11-15, 1432\n\nThe next four days are spent putting Íllora back together and preparing your army for the next phase.\n\nThe Wounded:\n\nYour field hospital is overwhelmed. One hundred sixty-four wounded men, fifty-two of them seriously. Surgeons work around the clock—amputating shattered limbs, stitching sword cuts, extracting arrows, fighting the infections that always follow battle.\n\nSome will recover fully. Others will never fight again—missing arms, crippled legs, wounds that won't properly heal. You arrange for the most seriously wounded to be transported back to Castilian territory in wagons. Forty-three men begin the journey home, some to recover, some simply to die among family rather than in a field hospital.\n\nOne young soldier stops you as his wagon prepares to leave. He's missing his right hand, the stump bandaged. \"Your Majesty, we took it. We took Íllora. It was worth it.\" You're not sure if he's trying to convince you or himself.\n\nThe Town:\n\nÍllora is battered but not destroyed. Work crews clear rubble, repair damaged buildings, restore basic services. The Muslim civilians who remain—those without family in Granada—slowly emerge from hiding. They're wary, terrified, but your strict orders about protection hold. No looting. No violence against civilians.\n\nA delegation of townspeople approaches on the second day—three older men, clearly community leaders. Through a translator: \"Your Majesty, we expected death. Slavery. Instead you protect us. Feed us. Let us keep our faith.\" The eldest adds: \"Commander Hamza said Christians could not be trusted. He was wrong.\"\n\nThe Artillery:\n\nPietro and his crews spend three days maintaining the bombards. The guns are cleaned, barrels inspected for cracks, carriages repaired. The intensive bombardment took its toll—one carriage needs significant rebuilding, powder stores must be replenished from supply wagons.\n\n\"The guns performed well, Your Majesty,\" Pietro reports. \"But they're tired. Like the men. Everything needs maintenance after this.\"\n\nThe Troops:\n\nMorale is complicated. The men won—decisively—but the cost was high. You hear it in conversations around campfires:\n\n\"Eighty-seven dead for one fortress. How many more before we reach Granada?\"\n\n\"At least the prisoners will be freed eventually. King kept his word.\"\n\n\"Did you see how their own officers killed their commander? They were that desperate to surrender.\"\n\n\"Should have just stormed it on day one. Would've cost the same blood and saved four days.\"\n\nThe war-weariness is real. But so is grim determination. They've come this far. They'll finish it.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava gives you his assessment on the third day: \"They're recovering, Your Majesty. The rest helps. The mercy you showed at the end helps—they see their king values life, even enemy life. But they're counting the cost. Íllora took nearly ninety dead. If every fortress costs that much...\" He doesn't finish the thought.\n\nStrategic Situation: April 15, 1432\n\nBy the fifth day, the army is ready to move again. Intelligence reports arrive from scouts and from the eleven released prisoners who've now reached Granada with their news:\n\nMoclín Status:\nWord from the north—Infante Juan's force from Jaén (now numbering approximately 3,200 troops) has begun besieging Moclín. No artillery, so it will be a longer siege. Early reports suggest the garrison there is watching what happened at Íllora very carefully.\n\nGranada's Reaction:\nThe released prisoners have delivered their message to Sultan Yusuf. Reports say the Sultan is shaken by the news—that a major fortress fell in just four days of siege, that even Hamza's resistance only delayed the inevitable, that you kept your word even after being refused.\n\nOther Fortresses:\nIntelligence suggests the garrisons at remaining strongpoints (Alhama, Montefrío, and smaller positions) are nervous. Word of Íllora's fall is spreading. Some commanders are reportedly arguing about whether to resist or negotiate.\n\nYour Forces:\n\n12,850 troops available (after garrison duties and casualties)\n\nFive bombards operational\n\nSupply lines secure from your western conquests\n\nMorale: Steady but wary\n\nThe Master of Calatrava spreads the map before you. \"Íllora is ours. Moclín is under siege by Infante Juan. That leaves the southern approaches—Alhama de Granada is the key fortress there, twenty-five miles southwest of the capital. Or we could move directly on Granada itself, though that's a much larger undertaking.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo adds: \"The news from those released prisoners will have an effect. Every garrison commander now knows: refuse surrender and face bombardment and assault. Accept terms and live with honor. That may change calculations at the next fortress.\"\n\nYour army is ready. The bombards are loaded on their carriages. The troops are formed up. Íllora stands behind you, Castilian banners flying from its battered walls.\n\nWhere do you march next?"

If your personal presence worked at Sanlúcar, and the garrison at Moclín just heard what happened here...\" He doesn't finish, but the implication is clear.\n\nDon Rodrigo adds: \"They've been watching Infante Juan's forces dig siege lines for days now. No artillery to threaten them yet, but they know it's coming. Your arrival with the bombards might be enough to convince them.\"\n\nYou give orders: \"The army rests here. Restore strength, repair equipment, organize the town's administration. I'll take my household guard and fast riders to Moclín. If they surrender quickly, we can all move on Alhama together. If not...\" You gesture to the bombards. \"Have these ready to march north on my word.\"\n\nThe Ride to Moclín: April 15-16, 1432\n\nYou depart Íllora at dawn with your household guard—García, Fernando, and forty mounted men-at-arms. Fast travel, changing horses at captured fortresses along the route. The ride takes you northeast through increasingly familiar territory—lands conquered last year, now held by Castilian garrisons.\n\nThe contrast with a year ago is stark. Then, this was hostile enemy territory. Now, Castilian patrols ride freely. Villages that were abandoned are being resettled. Fields that were burned are being planted again. The conquest is taking root.\n\nBy evening of the first day, you reach a forward supply depot. By noon of the second day, you see it in the distance: Moclín.\n\nMoclín: April 16, 1432 - Afternoon\n\nThe fortress sits on a dramatic rocky outcrop, smaller than Íllora but impressively sited. The castle seems to grow from the stone itself, walls following the natural contours of the hill. Perhaps six hundred buildings cluster below the fortress proper—a decent-sized town.\n\nInfante Juan's siege camp spreads around the base. You can see the siege lines being dug, mantlets being constructed, trebuchets being assembled. It's a competent siege, but without artillery, it's going to be a long one.\n\nA sentry spots your banners and word spreads quickly. By the time you ride into camp, Infante Juan is there to greet you, looking pleased and surprised.\n\n\"Your Majesty! We didn't expect you.\" He clasps your arm warmly. \"How did Íllora fall?\"\n\nYou tell him briefly—the bombardment, the breach, the costly assault, Hamza's refusal and eventual overthrow by his own officers.\n\nInfante Juan's expression grows serious. \"Eighty-seven dead. God rest them.\" He looks up at Moclín's walls. \"The garrison here heard what happened. They've been quieter these past two days. No sorties, no defiance. Just watching our siege lines go up.\"\n\n\"How many in the garrison?\"\n\n\"Perhaps three hundred fifty troops. Commander is one Qaid Rahman al-Zagal—veteran, professional. He's been probing our positions, testing our strength, but nothing aggressive.\" Infante Juan gestures to the siege works. \"Without your bombards, I'm looking at three to four weeks before we can even attempt an assault. Mining, maybe, or starve them out.\"\n\n\"Or I offer them terms,\" you say quietly.\n\nInfante Juan smiles slightly. \"That's why you're here. Let's see if they're smarter than Hamza was.\"\n\nThe Offer: April 16, Late Afternoon\n\nYou don your white armor and ride toward Moclín's main gate under the flag of truce, García and Fernando flanking you. Infante Juan's troops watch from the siege lines. On the fortress walls, you can see defenders gathering—word spreading that the King of Castile himself has arrived.\n\nYou stop at speaking distance from the gate, same as you did at Íllora four days ago.\n\n\"I am Juan of Castile!\" Your voice carries across the distance. \"I come to speak with Commander Rahman al-Zagal! I offer terms of surrender!\"\n\nSilence. Movement on the walls—men conferring, pointing, clearly debating.\n\nThen a voice responds in accented Castilian: \"Your Majesty does Moclín great honor with his presence!\" The tone is careful, respectful. Not the hostility Hamza showed. \"I am Qaid Rahman al-Zagal, commander of this fortress. You offer terms?\"\n\n\"I do!\" you call back. \"The same terms offered at every fortress! Lay down your arms with honor, take safe conduct to Granada or stay under Castilian rule, no forced conversions! Or—\" you pause deliberately, \"—face what Íllora faced. Bombardment, breach, assault. I have five bombards two days' march from here. I can bring them to these walls and repeat what happened at Íllora.\"\n\nAnother pause. Longer this time. You can see animated discussion on the walls.\n\nFinally, Rahman's voice again: \"Your Majesty, we heard what happened at Íllora. Commander Hamza refused your terms. It cost him his fortress, his freedom, and many lives.\" A beat. \"We also heard you kept your word even after being refused. That you treated prisoners with honor. That you protected civilians.\"\n\n\"I did,\" you confirm. \"And I offer the same to Moclín.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" Rahman's voice is thoughtful now. \"May I request time to consult with my officers? This is a decision that affects many lives. Give us until tomorrow morning, and I will have an answer for you.\"\n\nFrom the walls, you can see no defiance, no preparation for battle. Just a garrison waiting to hear what their commander decides.\n\nWhat do you tell Rahman al-Zagal?"

Then arrows—not at you (truce violation), but at the ground before your position. A voice shouts from walls: \"We are sworn to Sultan Yusuf! We will not surrender to Christian invaders!\" The success factors are acknowledged—they know about Íllora, know about your reputation—but duty and pride overwhelm. \"Come with your bombards if you will! We'll defend these walls!\" Hardline response. Your direct challenge is met with defiance. Siege continues.\n\n13-25: SUSPICIOUS REFUSAL\nGates remain closed. After tense wait, voice from walls: \"Fine words, King of Castile. But we've heard Christian promises before. We choose to defend.\" They acknowledge Íllora's fall, recognize your presence, but mistrust wins. \"If you want Moclín, take it by force.\" Not hostile like Hamza, but firm refusal. The success factors exist but can't overcome the failure factors. Will require siege.\n\n26-38: CONFLICTED PARALYSIS\nMovement on walls—clearly internal debate happening. Finally: \"Your Majesty, we... need time to discuss. Give us until morning.\" They're torn. Íllora's example is powerful, your reputation matters, but duty conflicts with survival. They can't decide immediately. Not rejection, but not acceptance. Internal divisions visible. May need more pressure or time to resolve.\n\n39-52: CAUTIOUS CONSIDERATION\nAfter pause, voice responds: \"Your Majesty honors us with your presence. We heard what happened at Íllora. We know your reputation.\" Professional acknowledgment of facts. \"But we have duties. Oaths. What exactly do you offer? And how do we know the terms will hold?\" They're listening—success factors are real—but need convincing. Want details. Ready to negotiate but wary.\n\n53-65: SERIOUS NEGOTIATION\nGate opens partially. Officer emerges with guards—stops at respectful distance. \"Your Majesty, we saw what your bombards did at Íllora. We know Commander Hamza refused and paid the price.\" He's acknowledging reality. \"If you offer the same terms—safe conduct, honor, protection—we are willing to discuss surrender. But we need assurances. Time to organize. Our commander wishes to negotiate properly.\" Opening created. Success factors working.\n\n66-77: STRONG MOMENTUM\nQuicker response. Gate opens, delegation of three officers emerges. Lead officer salutes respectfully. \"Your Majesty, we are soldiers. We can see reality.\" Gestures at siege works. \"Infante Juan surrounds us. Your bombards arrive in days. We heard what happened at Íllora when resistance was offered.\" Pause. \"If you guarantee safety, honor, choice to stay or leave—we believe we can accept. Let us bring this to Commander Rahman. We think he will agree.\" Very positive response.\n\n78-87: EAGER ACCEPTANCE\nGates open within minutes. Commander Rahman al-Zagal himself emerges with full delegation. Removes helmet respectfully. \"Your Majesty, you do us honor by coming personally.\" He's direct, professional. \"We heard everything about Íllora. How you offered mercy. How Hamza refused. How it cost many lives. How you kept your word anyway.\" He meets your eyes. \"We are not fools. We cannot win. If you offer the same terms—we accept. Moclín is yours.\"\n\n88-95: GRATEFUL RELIEF\nImmediate response. Gates swing open, garrison commander rides out—approaching with obvious relief. \"Your Majesty! Thank God—thank Allah—you've come!\" Genuine emotion. \"We've been dreading this siege. Watching what happened at Íllora. Knowing the bombards would come eventually.\" He's almost stammering. \"You offer surrender with honor? Safe conduct? Protection? We accept! All of it! Please, let us avoid what Íllora suffered. The garrison will lay down arms today if you'll have us.\"\n\n96-100: IMMEDIATE ENTHUSIASTIC SURRENDER\nBefore you finish speaking, white flags appear on every tower. Gates thrown wide open. Commander Rahman and entire officer corps rush out, many smiling with relief. \"Your Majesty! We surrender! Completely!\" Rahman actually laughs. \"We spent last night debating whether to send envoys to YOU. You saved us the trouble!\" He gestures at fortress. \"Take it now, today, this hour. No blood needs to spill. Íllora taught us everything we needed to know. You are merciful and you keep your word. That's all we need.\"\n\nRoll your d100 to see how Moclín's garrison responds to Juan's direct offer."

This should be a positive interaction but still requires Juan to engage in negotiation.\n\nI need to:\n1. Describe the gate opening and officer emerging\n2.

You can see movement on the walls, heads turning, men clearly conferring urgently.\n\nThen, with the grinding sound of wood and iron, the main gate begins to open.\n\nNot fully. Perhaps eight feet—enough for men to emerge but ready to close quickly. A senior officer steps through, flanked by four guards with drawn swords. They advance twenty yards from the gate and stop—close enough to speak clearly, far enough to retreat safely.\n\nThe officer is perhaps forty-five, graying beard, good armor beneath a green surcoat. He removes his helmet and tucks it under his arm in a gesture of respect. His face shows no hostility—just careful assessment.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His Castilian is clear, practiced. \"You honor Moclín with your presence. We did not expect the King of Castile himself to ride to our gates.\"\n\nHe pauses, glancing back at the fortress, then continues: \"We heard what happened at Íllora. The messengers arrived two days ago.\" His voice is measured, factual. \"Commander Hamza refused your terms. You brought your bombards. You breached the walls in three days. The town was stormed at great cost—eighty-seven of your soldiers killed, many more wounded. Nearly two hundred of the garrison dead.\"\n\nAnother pause. Behind him, more officers have gathered at the gate, watching and listening.\n\n\"We also heard what came after.\" His tone shifts slightly—acknowledgment of something significant. \"That Commander Hamza's own officers overthrew him to stop the killing. That you accepted their surrender even though your original terms had expired. That you kept your word about the prisoners—sent them to Antequera under guard, treated fairly, to be released when the crusade ends. That you protected the civilians despite the blood already spilled.\"\n\nHe looks directly at you now. \"Your Majesty, we are soldiers. We understand military reality.\" He gestures at the siege works behind you, where Infante Juan's forces watch. \"We are surrounded. Our garrison numbers perhaps three hundred fifty men. Your bombards—which broke Íllora's walls in days—can be here within the week. Sultan Yusuf cannot reach us in time even if he wished to.\"\n\nFrom the gate, another figure emerges—older, more ornately armored. Even at this distance, his bearing marks him as the commander. He walks forward to stand beside the first officer but does not yet speak. Just watches. Evaluates.\n\nThe first officer continues: \"If you offer the same terms you offered Íllora—safe conduct with honor, choice to leave for Granada or stay under Castilian rule, protection for civilians, no forced conversions—then we are willing to discuss surrender seriously.\"\n\nThe commander—this must be Rahman al-Zagal—finally speaks. His voice is deeper, more authoritative: \"But Your Majesty, we have questions. Assurances we need.\" He's not hostile, but he's careful. \"The prisoners at Antequera—you swear they will be released when the crusade ends? How long might that be? What exactly does 'Christian rule' mean for those who stay? What protections do we have that these terms won't change once we've laid down our weapons?\"\n\nThe first officer adds: \"Commander Hamza's mistake was refusing to negotiate at all. We will not make that error. But we need to negotiate properly. To understand fully what we are accepting.\"\n\nBehind them at the gate, you can see more of the garrison gathering—soldiers straining to hear, officers waiting to learn what their commander decides. Unlike at Íllora, there's no visible internal conflict. They're united in wanting to hear what you offer, even if not yet committed to accepting it.\n\nRahman al-Zagal looks at you steadily. \"Your Majesty has come in person to offer terms. This shows respect. We wish to respond with equal respect—by negotiating seriously, not refusing out of pride or fear. But we must understand what we're agreeing to before we open these gates.\"\n\nHe waits for your response. The garrison waits. This is the moment—they're willing to talk, ready to consider surrender, but need the details that will let them trust what comes next.\n\nWhat do you tell them?"
