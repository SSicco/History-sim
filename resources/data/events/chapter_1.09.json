Hernando assesses Enrique as genuinely committed with a warrior's soul seeking redemption, and Juan as more intellectual but sincere enough. Both send orders for their household troops (~3,600 men) to muster at Seville. Juan II accepts them as crusaders and offers to make them commanders, but declines their proposal for direct command of their levies. Individual soldiers may join voluntarily. About 800 from the Infantes' households eventually join as crusaders.",

Keep it conversational and open-ended.\n\nChapter 9: The Waiting Period\n\nDate: November 9, 1430\nLocation: Royal Palace, Seville\n\nThe morning after the Council dawns clear and cool. The euphoria of yesterday's success still hangs in the air - you can hear it in how the palace servants speak in excited whispers, in how the guards stand a bit straighter, in how the city itself seems to hum with energy.\n\nThe Portuguese princess won't arrive for another five to six weeks, sometime in mid-December. The wedding is planned for January or February. Between now and then, you have crucial decisions to make about how to use this time.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna arrives in your private chamber shortly after dawn, carrying morning reports. He looks more relaxed than you've seen him in months - the weight of the failed rebellion and political uncertainty visibly lifted.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he begins, settling into a chair at your gesture. \"Yesterday was extraordinary. The nobles are still speaking of it - I've had three separate visits this morning from lords who want to discuss contributing troops to the crusade. The city is alive with talk of the ceremony, the clasps, your mercy toward the Infantes.\"\n\nHe pauses, organizing the papers in his hands. \"But we have immediate practical matters to address. The Infantes, for one - will they actually appear for recruitment with Fray Hernando, or will they disappear back to their fortresses and become fugitive rebels? We should hear within days. Then there's the question of what to do with these weeks before the princess arrives. And of course, Granada sits across the frontier, watching everything.\"\n\nHe looks up from his papers. \"What would you like to focus on first?\""

          "text": "**Current Position:**\n- They were found guilty of rebellion\n- They swore oaths of vassalage before the entire council\n- They offered \"everything\" including their lives, troops, and fortresses\n- They have safe conduct but were told to present themselves for normal recruitment\n- They control ~5,000 troops and three fortresses\n- Their brother King Alfonso V of Aragon might react to their renunciation\n\n**Key Factors Influencing Their Decision:**\n1. They were completely outmaneuvered - the papal bull, the Portuguese betrothal, Juan's strategic brilliance caught them off-guard\n2. The complete admission of guilt seemed to work - the nobles were moved by their honesty\n3. They swore sacred oaths before archbishops - breaking them means excommunication risk\n4. Their propaganda about Juan being \"unstable\" and \"mystical\" was completely disproven\n5. Juan showed them mercy when he could have pushed for harsh punishment\n6. They're princes of Aragon - Alfonso V is their brother and might help them\n7. The crusade has massive momentum - being part of it could restore their honor\n8. They still command troops and fortresses - they have some bargaining power\n\n**Possible Options:**\n\n1. **Honor their oaths completely** - Present themselves for recruitment, genuinely commit to crusade, try to earn redemption through service. This seems most likely given:\n   - The sacred nature of the oaths\n   - That their plotting was exposed so thoroughly\n   - Juan's demonstration of divine favor with the papal bull\n   - The nobles' reaction to their honesty\n   - That opposing Juan now means opposing clear papal authority\n\n2. **Stall and negotiate** - Show up for recruitment but try to negotiate special terms, delay, or modify conditions. Try to preserve some autonomy while technically honoring oaths.\n\n3. **Flee to Aragon** - Go to Alfonso V, explain situation, seek his protection and support to continue opposition from outside Castile.\n \nI see four additional risky strategies that could potentially preserve their power or challenge Juan's authority. Returning to their fortresses represents a direct challenge, potentially reigniting the conflict. Splitting their strategy by having one brother comply while another escapes provides a backup plan. An assassination attempt, while desperate, could be their last resort to regain control.\n\nThe most rational approach remains honoring their oaths, given the overwhelming political and religious pressure. Their previous defeat and Juan's strategic victory make open rebellion extremely unwise. The potential consequences - excommunication, loss of noble support, and complete delegitimization - far outweigh any potential gains from resistance.\n\nNegotiation offers a more nuanced path, allowing them to test Juan's resolve while maintaining some semblance of dignity. Fleeing to Aragon presents a risky alternative, potentially breaking sacred commitments and relying on uncertain protection from Alfonso.\n\nThe probabilities reflect the strategic calculus: complete submission is most likely, followed by careful negotiation, with more confrontational options becoming increasingly improbable.\n\nThe Infantes' Options\n\nBased on their current position - guilty of rebellion, sworn to oaths before the council, granted safe conduct but required to undergo normal recruitment - here are their possible courses of action:\n\nOption Analysis\n\nOption 1: Honor Oaths Completely\n\nPresent themselves to Fray Hernando within days\n\nSubmit to full recruitment process (physical and spiritual examination)\n\nAccept treatment as common crusaders\n\nGenuinely commit to serving under Juan's command\n\nTransfer their troops and fortresses as promised\n\nOption 2: Stall and Negotiate\n\nShow up for recruitment but request modifications\n\nArgue they should retain some rank/authority given their status\n\nTry to delay the spiritual examination\n\nKeep control of their troops while \"in process\"\n\nTest whether Juan will compromise\n\nOption 3: Flee to Aragon\n\nReturn to their brother King Alfonso V\n\nSeek his protection and support\n\nArgue the renunciation was made under duress\n\nTry to continue opposition from outside Castile\n\nRisk: Breaks sacred oaths sworn before archbishops\n\nOption 4: Return to Fortresses and Fortify\n\nGo back to Arévalo and their castles\n\nRefuse to present themselves for recruitment\n\nBecome open rebels again\n\nDare Juan to attack them before crusade begins\n\nGamble that he won't risk civil war now\n\nOption 5: Split Decision\n\nOne brother honors oath, one flees\n\nHedge their bets\n\nKeep options open for family\n\nRisk: Makes both look weak and cowardly\n\nOption 6: Desperate Measures\n\nAttempt assassination of Juan\n\nTry to seize relics or treasury\n\nExtremely high-risk coup attempt\n\nAlmost certainly suicidal given current situation\n\nD100 Probability Table\n\nRoll Range\nResult\nProbability\n01-50\nHonor Oaths Completely\n50%\n51-70\nStall and Negotiate\n20%\n71-85\nFlee to Aragon\n15%\n86-93\nReturn to Fortresses\n8%\n94-98\nSplit Decision\n5%\n99-00\nDesperate Measures\n2%\n\nWhen you're ready, roll your d100 and tell me the result.\n\nThe outcome will determine what message arrives at your palace over the next few days - whether riders come announcing the Infantes have presented themselves to Fray Hernando, or whether different, more troubling news reaches your ears."

They'd also need to undergo the physical assessment with Rodrigo/the military commanders\n3. They'd need to formally transfer their troops and fortresses\n4. This is a dramatic moment - princes becoming common crusaders\n\nI should describe this over several days, showing:\n- The surprise when they actually show up\n- The examinations themselves (both physical and spiritual)\n- Reactions from the court and crusaders\n- The practical transfer of their military assets\n- How this affects the broader political situation\n\nI need to NOT write any dialogue or actions for Juan. I should describe what happens, present Juan with the situation, and then stop to let him respond or make decisions.\n\nLet me structure this as a few days passing, with key events, and then pause for Juan's response.\n\nThree Days After the Council\n\nNovember 12, 1430, Morning\n\nDay One: November 9 - The Arrival\n\nThe morning after the council, you receive word that surprises even Álvaro: the Infantes de Aragón have requested immediate audience with Fray Hernando de Talavera for their spiritual examination. They arrived at the monastery where Fray Hernando is staying at dawn, accompanied only by two servants each - no armed retinue, no display of princely status.\n\nThe news spreads through the palace within hours. Nobles who witnessed yesterday's oaths are impressed. The crusaders training in the courtyard buzz with excitement - princes actually submitting to the same process as farm boys and merchants' sons.\n\nDay Two: November 10 - The Examinations\n\nFray Hernando spends the entire day in private examination with the Infantes. You receive no word during the process - your confessor takes the seal of confession seriously even in this unusual circumstance.\n\nMeanwhile, Rodrigo and Sir Thomas conduct the physical assessments. Both princes prove capable riders and experienced fighters, though Infante Enrique is notably more skilled than his older brother Juan. They handle weapons competently, demonstrate knowledge of military formations, and possess the physical endurance expected of knights.\n\nBy evening, messengers arrive from their respective fortresses: formal orders signed by both Infantes commanding their household troops to report to Seville and place themselves under your command. Arévalo's garrison commander sends word that he will arrive within two weeks with approximately 2,800 men. The two smaller castles will contribute another 400 men each.\n\nTotal incoming forces: ~3,600 troops from the Infantes' direct control\n\nThis doesn't include their allied noble houses who supported them during the rebellion - those lords will make their own decisions about whether to honor their former patrons' commitments.\n\nDay Three: November 11 - The Verdict\n\nLate afternoon, Fray Hernando requests private audience with you in your chambers. He looks exhausted - two days of intensive spiritual examination has clearly drained him.\n\nHe settles heavily into a chair before speaking: \"Your Majesty, I have spent hours with both princes. I have heard their confessions, questioned their motivations, tested their understanding of what it means to be a soldier of Christ in this crusade.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his words carefully. \"Infante Enrique's commitment is genuine. His faith is... simple, perhaps, but real. He truly believes he can earn redemption through service. He wants to be a good Christian and sees the crusade as his path to salvation. His warrior's soul responds to the clarity of it - fight for Christ, protect the weak, earn God's mercy through deeds.\"\n\nAnother pause. \"Infante Juan is more complicated. His faith is intellectual rather than emotional. He understands why what he did was wrong - politically, morally, spiritually. He's genuinely ashamed. But his commitment to the crusade is partially pragmatic. He sees it as the best path forward for himself and his family. That doesn't make it false, just... layered.\"\n\nFray Hernando looks directly at you. \"I believe both are sincere enough to accept as crusaders. Neither is perfect - but then, none of us are. Infante Enrique will serve with whole heart. Infante Juan will serve competently and faithfully, even if part of his mind remains calculating. Is that sufficient?\"\n\nBefore you can answer, there's a knock at the door. One of your chamberlains enters: \"Your Majesty, forgive the interruption. The Infantes de Aragón request audience. They wish to know your decision about their acceptance into the crusade, and they have... a proposal regarding their military forces.\"\n\nThe Infantes are waiting in an antechamber. Their fate - and the fate of their 3,600 troops - awaits your decision.\n\nWhat do you do?"

A moment later, the door opens again and both Infantes enter.\n\nThey're dressed simply - no jewels, no elaborate court dress, just clean but modest clothing more suited to minor knights than princes. Both kneel immediately upon entering, not the formal court bow but the full kneel of vassals before their lord.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Infante Juan speaks first, his voice steady but without the confident edge you remember from past encounters. \"We come to hear your judgment on our fitness to serve in the crusade. Father Hernando has examined us these past two days. We have held nothing back from him, and we hold nothing back from you now.\"\n\nInfante Enrique remains kneeling, head bowed, silent. His hands are clasped before him almost in prayer.\n\nInfante Juan continues: \"We have also sent orders to our fortresses. Our household troops - approximately 3,600 men - are being mustered and will arrive within two weeks. They come under your command, to be deployed as you see fit.\"\n\nHe pauses, then: \"But we wish to make a proposal about their organization, if you will hear it. We understand we have no authority to demand anything, but we hope you will consider it as men trying to serve as effectively as possible.\"\n\nBoth remain kneeling, waiting for your permission to rise and speak further."

Let me make their dialogue natural and show their different personalities - Juan more articulate and political, Enrique more direct and martial.\n\nThe Infantes' Response\n\nBoth men rise, and there's visible emotion on their faces - relief, gratitude, and something that might be genuine humility.\n\nInfante Enrique speaks first, his voice rougher than his brother's: \"Your Majesty, I... we did not expect such generosity. To be accepted is mercy enough. To be offered command...\" He trails off, seeming genuinely overwhelmed.\n\nInfante Juan composes himself more quickly, though his eyes are bright. \"You honor us far beyond what we deserve. We will prove worthy of this trust, I swear it.\" Then he nods. \"Yes, Your Majesty, you understand correctly. Our household troops - they are experienced soldiers, many of them serving our family for years. They know our commands, our style of leadership. They're accustomed to fighting as cohesive units under officers they trust.\"\n\nHe glances at his brother, then continues: \"Our proposal is this: Let us continue to command these men directly as part of the crusading army. Not as independent forces - we would be under your supreme command absolutely, as the papal bull requires. But as integrated units that retain their internal structure and cohesion.\"\n\nInfante Enrique adds: \"Good soldiers fight better when they trust their immediate commanders. These men know us. They'll follow our orders without hesitation. But if you scatter them among other units or put strangers in command of them, you lose that cohesion. You lose effectiveness.\"\n\nInfante Juan: \"We would report directly to you or your designated supreme commanders - Captain Fernán, perhaps, or Álvaro. Whatever chain of command you establish. But let the troops themselves remain organized as they are. It's simply more efficient military practice.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his next words carefully. \"We understand if you don't trust us enough for this. We understand if you want these men broken up and mixed with other forces to prevent any possibility of... future problems. We've given you reason to doubt us. But from a purely military standpoint, you'd be getting more effective fighting units if they remain intact under officers they know.\"\n\nBoth wait for your response. The proposal is reasonable from a military efficiency standpoint, but it also means giving them direct command over nearly 4,000 soldiers - a significant armed force that could potentially be turned against you if their oaths prove false.\n\nWhat do you say?"

NOT letting them keep direct command of 3,600 troops right away (prudent)\n3. Releasing their household troops to return to their normal duties (the levies can go home)\n4. Making it clear that if individual soldiers want to join the crusade, they're welcome to do so as individuals\n5. Offering to use the Infantes' command abilities but not giving them an independent power base\n\nThis is politically brilliant - he gets their military expertise without giving them a private army. The troops go home, but individual soldiers who want to crusade can volunteer.\n\nNow I need to:\n- Have the Infantes respond to this (they might be slightly disappointed but should accept it)\n- Process to wherever the banner is kept\n- Conduct the oath ceremony before the banner\n- This should be a significant moment\n\nThe banner with the True Cross and Santiago's bone would be kept in a secure, sacred location - probably the palace chapel or a specially designated chamber.\n\nThe Oath Before the Banner\n\nBoth Infantes exchange a quick glance. There's a flicker of something - disappointment, perhaps, or calculation - but Infante Juan bows his head immediately.\n\n\"Of course, Your Majesty. You are wise to be cautious, and your logic is sound. When the crusade requires levies, we will call upon our households. Until then, our men may return to their duties.\" He pauses. \"Those who wish to join as individual crusaders will be welcomed, I trust?\"\n\nInfante Enrique adds: \"Some will come. My household captain, Rodrigo de Mendoza, has already told me he wants to take the cross personally. Perhaps a dozen others. Good men.\"\n\n\"They will be welcomed like any other crusader,\" Infante Juan confirms, speaking more to his brother than to you. Then both straighten. \"We are ready to take our oaths, Your Majesty.\"\n\nThe Procession to the Banner\n\nYou lead them through the palace corridors. Word spreads quickly - servants pause in their work, guards snap to attention. By the time you reach the chapel where the banner is kept under guard, a small crowd has gathered: Álvaro, Fray Hernando following close behind, several of your commanders including Rodrigo and García, and a handful of nobles who happened to be in the palace.\n\nThe chapel doors open. Inside, the white banner dominates the space, mounted on its pole before the altar. The gold reliquary holding the fragment of the True Cross catches the candlelight on the upper mount. Below it, the silver reliquary with Santiago's bone gleams. The banner itself seems to glow in the dim chapel, the white silk almost luminous.\n\nFour guards stand at the corners - your sworn banner guards who never leave their posts.\n\nThe Infantes stop at the threshold, both staring at the banner. Infante Enrique makes the sign of the cross. Infante Juan's face has gone very still.\n\nFray Hernando moves to stand beside the banner, prayer book in hand. Álvaro takes position off to one side, witnessing. The small crowd arranges itself along the chapel walls.\n\nYou stand before the banner with your father's sword at your side. The Non Nobis Domine inscription is visible in the candlelight.\n\nFray Hernando speaks quietly: \"Your Majesty, are you ready to accept these men as crusaders in your holy army?\""

But he might be affected by his brother's reaction\n\n**What could happen:**\n\nMost likely: Both proceed, but there might be a visible moment of hesitation from Infante Juan\n\nPossible: Juan experiences a profound moment of doubt, briefly revealing his inner conflict. His calculated nature might surface as a fleeting hesitation before commitment. Enrique stands firm, his martial spirit unwavering. The sacred relics create a psychological pressure that forces Juan to ultimately proceed, despite his internal reservations.\n\nThe dramatic tension emerges from Juan's momentary vulnerability, contrasting sharply with Enrique's resolute stance. This psychological interplay reveals the complex motivations driving their sacred oath.\n\nThe Moment of Truth\n\nYour question about whether the oaths \"can never be made undone\" seems to hit Infante Juan particularly hard. His face goes very still, and there's a long pause.\n\nInfante Enrique looks at his brother, then back at you. His voice is steady: \"I am ready, Your Majesty. I want this. I need this.\" There's no doubt in his tone.\n\nBut Infante Juan... he's silent. The calculating mind behind his eyes is clearly working through something. The candlelight flickers across his face.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says quietly, \"may I speak plainly? Before these sacred relics, I wish to speak only truth.\"\n\nHe glances at the True Cross, at Santiago's bone, at the white banner. When he looks back at you, there's something raw in his expression.\n\n\"I am King of Navarre. I have a son, Carlos, who is nine years old. When I offered 'everything' at the council, I was swept up in the moment - in fear, in the religious fervor, in the weight of my guilt. But now, standing here, about to swear before the Cross itself...\"\n\nHe pauses, swallows. \"I need to understand what I'm truly renouncing. Am I renouncing just my Castilian ambitions? Or my crown of Navarre? Am I binding my son, removing him from succession? Am I ending my bloodline's royal status forever?\"\n\nHis voice becomes almost pleading: \"I want to serve. I want to earn redemption. But I am also a father. I cannot... I need to know what I'm swearing before I swear it. Before God. Before these relics.\"\n\nInfante Enrique looks torn - loyal to his brother but also clearly ready to take the oath himself.\n\nÁlvaro shifts slightly, watching this unfold. Fray Hernando's expression is unreadable, but he's clearly listening intently.\n\nThe chapel is very quiet except for the guttering candles.\n\nThis is a crucial moment. The Infantes rolled to honor their oaths completely, but Infante Juan's calculating nature is asserting itself at the final moment - not to back out entirely, but to understand exactly what he's binding himself to before making an irrevocable sacred oath.\n\nHow do you respond?"

Remember that this is a personal choice, born from your desire to rid yourself of everything to distance yourself from pride and greed. Your thoughts turn to family and your young son. He is king of Navarra already is he not? Again, I am no scolar but you renouncing everything will not remove him as king I think. Wanting to provide for your family is a sacred bond between father and son and since we are family, I can promise you that I will look after your son should something befall him or if he otherwise would require my help and aid, or even in the event that - God forbid - you die in battle.

          "text": "Juan II is essentially saying:\n1. He doesn't know the precise legal implications\n2. The renunciation is personal/spiritual, about ridding oneself of pride and greed\n3. Carlos is already King of Navarre, so probably the renunciation doesn't affect him\n4. Juan II will protect/support Carlos as family\n5. Offers to do a legal study if needed\n\nThis is actually quite shrewd from Juan II - he's:\n- Not forcing a specific interpretation\n- Keeping it focused on the spiritual/personal dimension\n- Offering family protection (which is generous)\n- But also subtly suggesting they can figure out the legal details later\n\nInfante Juan would likely recognize this as:\n- An olive branch (the family protection promise is real and valuable)\n- A way forward that doesn't force him to explicitly renounce his son's inheritance\n- But also somewhat ambiguous - the \"personal choice\" framing could be interpreted either way later\n\nGiven that the dice roll was \"Honor Oaths Completely\" - Infante Juan should ultimately decide to proceed. But his calculating mind would want some clarity while also recognizing that Juan II is being reasonable and generous.\n\nI think Infante Juan would:\n1. Be reassured by the promise about Carlos\n2. Recognize that the ambiguity is actually helpful (allows flexibility later)\n3. Decide that the personal/spiritual renunciation is what matters now\n4. Proceed with the oath while understanding it doesn't necessarily legally bind Carlos\n5. Perhaps seek clarity on what exactly he IS renouncing\n\nLet me write this response.\n\nInfante Juan's Response\n\nInfante Juan takes a deep breath. The tension in his shoulders eases slightly at your words, particularly the promise about Carlos.\n\n\"Your Majesty, your promise to protect my son... that means more than you perhaps know.\" His voice is quieter now. \"And you're right - Carlos is already King of Navarre through his own inheritance, not through me. I have no power to unmake that.\"\n\nHe looks at the relics again, then back at you. \"So what I'm renouncing is... my Castilian ambitions. My claims here. My titles and estates in this kingdom. My plots and schemes for power.\" A pause. \"My pride.\"\n\nInfante Enrique speaks up: \"Brother, that's all you need to renounce. The crusade doesn't require us to abandon our families or destroy our sons' futures. It requires us to abandon our selfish ambition and serve God instead of ourselves.\"\n\nInfante Juan nods slowly. \"You're right.\" Then to you: \"Your Majesty, I don't need a legal study. I understand now. What I'm offering before these sacred relics is myself - my service, my sword, my life if God wills it. I'm renouncing my ambition to control Castile, to manipulate, to scheme. I'm not renouncing my son or his inheritance in Navarre. Those are separate things.\"\n\nHe straightens, and now his voice is firmer: \"I am ready to proceed, Your Majesty. I will swear to serve you as supreme commander of this crusade. I will swear to fight for Christ and the conversion of Granada. I will swear to follow your orders and honor the crusading vows. And I will mean it.\"\n\nFray Hernando speaks quietly: \"That is the oath we require. To serve God through service to this crusade. Not to unmake yourself or your family, but to transform your purpose.\"\n\nBoth Infantes kneel before the banner now, side by side.\n\nWhat do you do?"

          "text": "For Juan when he did this before the Pope, it was:\n- His crown\n- His wealth\n- His clothes\n- His body and soul\n- Everything material and spiritual\n\nBut Juan's situation was different - he was offering himself TO the Pope as God's representative, seeking a crusade bull. The Infantes are offering themselves to serve IN a crusade that's already authorized.\n\nAlso critically: Infante Juan has just expressed concern about his son Carlos and his inheritance of Navarre. Juan has just reassured him that he'll protect Carlos and that renouncing \"everything\" in Castile doesn't unmake Carlos as King of Navarre.\n\nNow Juan is asking them to confirm they're offering \"everything\" - \"all your wealth, all your titles, all your claims, everything until there is nothing left but your body and soul.\"\n\nThis creates a tension:\n1. Infante Juan just got reassurance about Carlos\n2. Now Juan is asking for \"everything\" again - all titles, all claims\n\nThe question is whether the Infantes interpret \"everything\" as:\n- Everything in Castile (their estates, their claims to Castilian power, their ambitions here)\n- Or literally everything including Navarre, including their sons' inheritances\n\nGiven that they rolled to honor their oaths completely, and given Infante Juan's calculating nature, I think he would:\n1. Notice this tension\n2. Seek one final clarification\n3. But ultimately be willing to proceed if he understands what he's swearing\n\nInfante Enrique, being simpler and more straightforward, would probably just say yes without overthinking it.\n\nLet me write this moment carefully.\n\nThe Final Clarification\n\nBoth Infantes are still kneeling. There's a long moment of silence.\n\nInfante Enrique speaks first, his voice strong and clear: \"Yes, Your Majesty. I offer everything. I stand naked before Christ. I have no ambition left but to serve Him through service to you and this crusade. I am ready.\"\n\nBut Infante Juan... he's looking at you very carefully. His voice is measured, almost lawyer-like despite the sacred setting:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you just told me that renouncing everything would not unmake my son as King of Navarre. That my oath here concerned my Castilian ambitions, not my family's separate inheritance. Now you ask if I offer 'all my titles, all my claims' - does that include Navarre? Are you asking me to renounce a crown that isn't even yours to accept?\"\n\nHe's not being defiant, but genuinely trying to understand. \"I want to give the right oath. The true oath. The one that serves God and this crusade. But I need to know what I'm actually swearing. Am I swearing to abandon all worldly power everywhere, including Navarre? Or am I swearing to abandon my Castilian estates and ambitions while remaining King of Navarre in name, even if I serve you in deed?\"\n\nThere's vulnerability in his voice now: \"Because I will swear either one, Your Majesty. If you require me to renounce Navarre and make my son vulnerable, I will do it. If serving Christ requires that sacrifice, I will make it. But I need to know which oath I'm taking before I take it.\"\n\nFray Hernando shifts slightly, clearly thinking about the theological and legal implications of what's being asked.\n\nÁlvaro's face is carefully neutral, but you can tell he's calculating the political ramifications of either answer.\n\nInfante Enrique looks between you and his brother, clearly ready to follow wherever this leads but waiting for clarity.\n\nThe question stands: What exactly are you asking them to renounce?"

He is right now king himself and after the crusade ends and you are released from your bonds of the crusader's oath, you can be regent of Navarra, a good steward as a father should be for his children. These posessions are not your own, they are of your sons and a father cannot give away that which is not his.\n\n\nAnd you will both abandon your claims to the throne of Aragorn for yourselves and your entire line. This allows you to stand before God with no ounce of greed or ambition left, clearing the way for new titles. We can discuss the details later but I will need nobles to rule Grenada after we have taken it and I will grant you both lands there when the crusade is successful.\n\n\nDoes this clarification satisfy you Juan?"

BUT - both Infantes must renounce claims to the throne of Aragon for themselves AND their entire bloodlines\n4. In exchange, they'll get lands in Granada after conquest\n\nThis is actually quite clever politically for Juan II:\n- He's removing potential rival claimants to Aragon (helping his own long-term vision of uniting the crowns)\n- He's giving them something concrete (future Granada lands) in exchange\n- He's allowing Juan to keep connection to Navarre through his son\n- But he's binding their bloodlines away from Aragon forever\n\nFor Infante Juan, this is a mixed situation:\n- His son Carlos keeps Navarre (good)\n- He can be regent there after crusade (good)\n- But Carlos and all descendants lose any claim to Aragon (significant)\n- They get promised lands in Granada (uncertain - crusade might fail, Granada might be years away)\n\nCurrently, the succession to Aragon is:\n- Alfonso V (married to Juan II's sister María, no children)\n- Next in line would be the Infantes (Juan and Enrique)\n- After them, Infante Juan's son Carlos (Prince of Viana)\n\nSo Juan II is asking them to remove a very valuable inheritance (potential kingship of Aragon) in exchange for:\n- Being accepted as crusaders\n- Future command positions\n- Eventual lands in Granada (if conquered)\n- Protection for Carlos in Navarre\n\nThis is a much bigger ask than just \"renouncing Castilian ambitions.\" This is removing their bloodline from a major crown's succession.\n\nWould Infante Juan accept this? Let me think...\n\nHe came here intending to honor his oaths (the dice roll was 32 - \"Honor Oaths Completely\"). \n\nThe proposal stretches far beyond the original council agreement. While initially focused on Castilian political intrigue, Juan II now seeks to reshape the entire Aragonese succession. Yet Infante Juan recognizes the strategic calculus. His pragmatic nature sees potential benefits: securing Navarre for his son, gaining future Granada lands, and maintaining Juan II's crucial support. The remote possibility of Aragonese inheritance seems a small price against these concrete advantages.\n\nHis acceptance would carry emotional weight - a significant personal sacrifice requiring his brother's endorsement and some additional guarantees. Unlike the more calculating Juan, Enrique would approach this with straightforward trust and commitment.\n\nThe Oath Defined\n\nInfante Juan goes very still. You can see him processing the full weight of what you're asking. His jaw tightens.\n\n\"The throne of Aragon,\" he says quietly. \"For myself and my entire line. Forever.\"\n\nHe looks at his brother. Infante Enrique's face shows surprise - clearly this goes beyond what he expected - but after a moment, he nods slowly. \"If that's what's required, brother. We came here to serve. To let go of ambition.\"\n\nInfante Juan turns back to you. \"Your Majesty, at the council, I thought I was renouncing my plots against Castile. My schemes to control you and this kingdom. But you're asking for much more. You're asking me to remove my son from the succession of Aragon. Carlos is currently heir after his uncle Alfonso. You're asking me to make that... disappear.\"\n\nHis voice isn't angry, but there's pain in it. \"Alfonso has no children after years of marriage to your sister. The crown would likely pass to my line. That's a kingdom, Your Majesty. One of the great crowns of Christendom. And you ask me to renounce it - not just for myself, but for Carlos, for any grandchildren I might have, forever.\"\n\nHe takes a breath. \"But I understand why. You're thinking of the future, of preventing any possibility that my family might threaten yours. You're thinking of uniting the crowns someday, and my bloodline stands in the way of that.\"\n\nFray Hernando speaks softly: \"This is a question for your conscience, Infante Juan. No one can make this choice for you.\"\n\nInfante Juan looks at the True Cross, at the banner, then back at you. When he speaks, his voice is steadier:\n\n\"I need one thing from you, Your Majesty. An oath before these same sacred relics. Swear that if something happens to me, you will protect my son Carlos's right to Navarre. Swear that you will not try to take that from him too. Let him have one crown, even if we renounce another.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"Swear that, and I will renounce Aragon for my entire line. I will stand naked before God with nothing but what you choose to grant me in Granada. I will do it.\"\n\nInfante Enrique adds quietly: \"I have no children. For me, renouncing Aragon is easier. But I stand with my brother. If you swear to protect Carlos in Navarre, we will both swear to renounce Aragon.\"\n\nThey're both looking at you, waiting.\n\nDo you swear this oath before the sacred relics?"

But he's done it in a way that honors the father-son bond and makes a sacred commitment in return.\n\nI need to make this moment feel as weighty and transformative as it deserves.\n\nThe Sacred Oaths\n\nThe chapel is utterly silent as you kneel before the banner, your father's sword held before you. The candlelight catches the inscription Non Nobis Domine as your prayer fills the sacred space.\n\nWhen you finish, Infante Juan's face is wet with tears. His brother has his hand over his mouth, visibly moved. Even Álvaro - practical, calculating Álvaro - has closed his eyes, his lips moving in silent prayer.\n\nFray Hernando makes the sign of the cross over you, then speaks in Latin: \"Dominus vobiscum.\" The Lord be with you.\n\nInfante Juan's voice breaks when he tries to speak. He has to stop, compose himself, try again. \"Your Majesty... cousin... I...\" He stops again, overwhelmed. Then he straightens, and his voice becomes clearer, stronger:\n\n\"Before Almighty God, before the True Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, before the holy bone of Santiago, I, Juan, formerly King of Navarre, renounce all claim to the throne of Aragon for myself and all my descendants forever. I offer everything - my wealth, my titles in Castile, my estates, my ambitions - to this crusade. I stand naked before God with nothing but my body and soul, which I pledge to the service of Christ through service to you as Supreme Commander of this holy crusade.\"\n\nHe's shaking now, but continues: \"I swear to follow your commands. I swear to fight for the conversion of Granada. I swear to uphold the virtues of a soldier of Christ - mercy, justice, and compassion even to our enemies. I swear this until the crusade is complete or death takes me. Non nobis domine, sed nomini tuo da gloriam.\"\n\nInfante Enrique speaks immediately after, his voice rough but steady: \"Before these same sacred relics, I, Enrique of Aragon, make the same oath. I renounce all claim to Aragon's throne for myself and any descendants I may have. I offer everything to this crusade. My body, my soul, my sword - all are yours to command in Christ's service. I swear to serve faithfully, to fight justly, and to prove myself worthy of the mercy you have shown. Until Granada falls or I fall.

Infante Enrique is the simpler, more emotional warrior. Infante Juan is the intellectual, calculating one who has just made an enormous sacrifice.\n\nThe scene should be quiet, reverent, and transformative. Others present (Fray Hernando, Álvaro, the guards, the nobles) should witness this moment with appropriate gravity.\n\nTouching the Sacred Relics\n\nBoth men rise slowly, almost hesitantly. They approach the banner together, standing before the reliquaries mounted on the white silk.\n\nInfante Enrique goes first. His warrior's hands, scarred from years of training and battle, reach up toward the gold reliquary holding the fragment of the True Cross. His fingers are trembling.\n\nWhen his fingertips touch the gold casing, he gasps - a sharp intake of breath. His eyes close immediately. Tears stream down his face. His lips move in silent prayer, his whole body rigid as if struck by lightning.\n\nHe stands like that for perhaps thirty seconds, hand pressed against the reliquary, completely still except for the tears. Then he moves his hand down to the silver reliquary below, touching the bone of Santiago with the same reverence. Another gasping breath. More tears.\n\nWhen he finally steps back, his legs nearly give out. One of the banner guards moves slightly, ready to catch him, but Enrique steadies himself against his brother's shoulder. His face is transformed - the hardness, the warrior's edge, all of it softened into something almost childlike in its wonder.\n\n\"I felt...\" he whispers hoarsely. \"I felt... everything. Every sin. Every grace. God's mercy. It's real. All of it is real.\" He can barely speak.\n\nNow Infante Juan steps forward. His approach is slower, more measured, but his face shows the same awe. When he reaches up to touch the True Cross reliquary, his hand hovers for a moment before making contact, as if afraid.\n\nThe moment his palm touches the gold, he inhales sharply. But unlike his brother's immediate emotional response, Juan's reaction is different - his eyes open wide, staring at the reliquary, and you can almost see his mind working even in this sacred moment. Processing. Trying to understand what he's feeling.\n\nHis hand moves to the silver reliquary below. When he touches Santiago's bone, his composure finally breaks. A sob escapes him - raw, painful. His other hand comes up to cover his mouth, but he doesn't pull away from the reliquary. His forehead bows down until it's nearly touching the banner itself.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" he whispers, barely audible. \"Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me...\" Over and over, like a prayer or a penance.\n\nHe stands like that much longer than his brother did - perhaps a full minute, maybe more. His shoulders shake with silent weeping. When he finally steps back, his face is ravaged by tears but somehow... lighter. As if something heavy has been lifted away.\n\nBoth brothers stand side by side now, both still crying, both looking at you with expressions that can only be described as gratitude mixed with something like love.\n\nFray Hernando's voice is gentle: \"Your Majesty, they have touched the sacred relics. They have made their oaths. Will you accept them as crusaders?\""

Show the Infantes' immediate reaction\n3. Have some of the other crusaders present respond/approach them\n4. Perhaps show a brief interaction between the new crusaders and the existing ones\n5. Then transition to the next day or allow Juan to leave the chapel\n\nThis is a good moment to show the crusader community forming - the brotherhood that Juan is building. The Infantes, former princes who plotted against him, are now truly integrated into the crusade as brothers among equals.\n\nThe Clasping\n\nYou step forward with the two commander clasps - bronze with silver inlay, the cross design surrounded by the aureole of divine favor, each one heavy with symbolism and craftsmanship.\n\nFirst Infante Juan. You pin the clasp to his simple tunic, just over his heart. He looks down at it, then back up at you, and tries to speak but can't find words. He simply bows his head deeply.\n\nThen Infante Enrique. As you pin the clasp to his chest, he grabs your hand suddenly - not threateningly, but with desperate gratitude. \"Thank you,\" he manages. \"Thank you, cousin. Thank you.\"\n\nYou step back. Both men touch their new clasps almost unconsciously, fingers tracing the cross design.\n\nFrom the shadows along the chapel wall, movement. Marco Tornesi, the redeemed mercenary, steps forward first. He looks at the two princes - now fellow crusaders - and his weathered face shows understanding.\n\n\"Brothers,\" he says simply. \"Welcome. That feeling doesn't go away. I touched those relics four months ago in Barcelona and I still feel it.\" He gestures to the door. \"Come. There's wine in the hall. You need to sit, drink, breathe. Let it settle in your soul.\"\n\nBrother Guillem, the monk-soldier, approaches next. \"The first hours after touching the Cross are... difficult. Beautiful but difficult. Your minds will race, your hearts will ache. This is normal. This is grace working in you.\" His simple faith radiates from him. \"I will pray with you, if you wish. Or simply sit with you in silence. Sometimes that's what's needed.\"\n\nAndrea Vescovi - the farm boy, first crusader, still gangly but now with a soldier's bearing - comes forward shyly. \"Your Excellencies... I mean, brothers... I remember when the King clasped me. I was so scared I'd do something wrong. But there's no wrong way to feel this. Just... feel it.\"\n\nGiovanni Rossi, the old blacksmith with the missing fingers, limps forward. \"Princes or peasants, doesn't matter before the Cross. You're crusaders now. Soldiers of Christ. That's all that matters.\" His rough voice is kind. \"Come, let's walk. Movement helps. Talk helps. Brotherhood helps.\"\n\nSergeant García catches your eye, nods respectfully, then moves to join the group forming around the Infantes. Captain Fernán appears in the doorway, assesses the situation with a soldier's quick understanding, and gestures for the group to follow him out.\n\nThe Infantes allow themselves to be led away by their new brothers, still touching their clasps, still wiping tears, but no longer alone in their overwhelming experience.\n\nFray Hernando approaches you as the chapel empties. \"That was... extraordinary, Your Majesty. The oaths, your prayer, their reaction to the relics. I've never seen anything quite like it.\" He pauses. \"They're truly crusaders now. Whatever they were before, whatever calculations might still lurk in Infante Juan's mind - they've been marked by grace. That changes a man.\"\n\nÁlvaro waits until only the three of you remain in the chapel with the banner guards. \"Your Majesty,\" he says quietly, \"you just secured the renunciation of two princes' claims to Aragon's throne, sworn before the holiest relics in Christendom, witnessed by your confessor and myself. And you gained their genuine loyalty in the process. That was...\" He shakes his head. \"Masterful doesn't quite capture it.\"\n\nThe chapel is quiet again except for the guttering candles. The white banner hangs serene, the reliquaries catching the light.\n\nTomorrow, the work of the crusade truly begins.\n\nWhat would you like to do now? The evening of November 12th stretches before you, and the crusade planning awaits tomorrow."

Infante Juan and Infante Enrique just renounced all claims to Aragon's throne for themselves and their entire lines\n2. Infante Juan has a son Carlos (age 9) who is King of Navarre\n3. King Alfonso V of Aragon (34) is married to Juan's sister María but has no children\n4. The normal succession would be: Alfonso V → his brothers (Juan, then Enrique) → Juan's son Carlos\n5. But now both brothers have renounced for their entire lines before sacred relics\n\nThis creates a MASSIVE succession crisis for Aragon. Alfonso is 34, no heir, and his brothers just removed themselves and their descendants from succession. Who inherits now?\n\nThis could:\n- Anger Alfonso V tremendously (his brothers just destabilized his kingdom)\n- Create civil war potential in Aragon when Alfonso dies\n- Make Alfonso see Juan II as manipulating his brothers\n- Cause diplomatic crisis between Castile and Aragon\n\nJuan is right - they need to write to Alfonso IMMEDIATELY to:\n1. Frame this as the brothers' own choice, not Juan's manipulation\n2. Explain the sacred context (crusade oaths before True Cross)\n3. Show the full proceedings transparently\n4. Perhaps suggest that Alfonso can still designate heirs or father children\n5. Emphasize that this strengthens the crusade (unity, no divided loyalties)\n\nÁlvaro would immediately recognize the danger here. He's been playing politics long enough to know this could blow up badly.\n\nThe Crisis Realized\n\nÁlvaro's face goes pale as the full implication hits him. He was so focused on the spiritual moment, on the crusade benefits, that he didn't immediately calculate the Aragonese succession implications.\n\n\"Mother of God,\" he breathes. \"You're right. Alfonso V has no heir. His brothers were next in line, and Juan's son Carlos after them. We just... we just removed the entire succession chain.\"\n\nHe starts pacing, his mind racing. \"When Alfonso hears that his brothers renounced their claims to his throne - sworn before sacred relics, binding their entire bloodlines - he'll see it as you manipulating them. Or worse, as you engineering a succession crisis in Aragon while he's focused on Naples.\"\n\nFray Hernando looks troubled. \"Those were sacred oaths, freely given. But the political consequences...\"\n\nÁlvaro cuts him off, not rudely but urgently: \"Father, the oaths are binding before God. That's not in question. But Alfonso doesn't know the context. He doesn't know his brothers touched the True Cross and wept. He doesn't know they came voluntarily. All he'll know is that his heirs renounced their claims while guests at Juan's court.\"\n\nHe turns to you. \"You're absolutely right - we need to write immediately. A full account. Complete transparency. Let him read exactly what was said, what oaths were made, the sacred context of it all.\"\n\nHe pauses, thinking rapidly. \"We should include:\n\nFull transcript of their testimony at the Council on November 8th\n\nDescription of their voluntary arrival for recruitment\n\nFray Hernando's examination results\n\nThe exact words of today's oaths\n\nYour own oath to protect Carlos and Navarre\n\nEmphasis that this strengthens the crusade against Granada\n\nPerhaps suggest that this doesn't preclude Alfonso fathering an heir himself, or designating successors as he sees fit\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"But Your Majesty, we need to be honest with ourselves about what just happened. Whether you intended it or not, you've just positioned yourself - or your potential children - much closer to the Aragonese succession. Alfonso won't miss that.\"\n\nFray Hernando adds quietly: \"The letter must emphasize that their renunciation was about their souls, not about Aragonese politics. That they did this to stand naked before God for the crusade, not to serve your ambitions.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"And we send it with a trusted messenger. Someone Alfonso respects. Perhaps even ask your sister María to witness the reading of it.\"\n\nHe looks at the door where the Infantes left. \"They're good men who made a sacred choice. But the kingdom of Aragon just had its succession thrown into chaos, and we have hours - maybe a day - to frame this properly before rumors reach Alfonso on their own.\"\n\nHow do you want to proceed with the letter?"

They then left under safe conduct and returned willingly, knowing full well what they were about to do. Then on infante Juan's insistance, we clarified the terms to make sure they were rid of ambition while making special arrangements for Carlos.

          "text": "Álvaro is helping Juan draft a crucial letter to Alfonso V of Aragon explaining what just happened with his brothers renouncing their claims. This is politically delicate - Alfonso could see this as Juan manipulating the succession.\n\nKey points to include:\n1. Full context from the Council\n2. The Infantes' voluntary actions\n3. Their multiple opportunities to back out\n4. Juan's oath to protect Carlos\n5. The sacred nature of the oaths\n6. Emphasis that this was about their souls, not politics\n7. Frame it as strengthening the crusade\n\nÁlvaro would want to discuss:\n- Tone (respectful but not apologetic)\n- Whether to mention Juan's own succession benefits\n- How to handle the timing (urgent vs. waiting for more information)\n- Whether to send supporting documents\n- Who should carry the letter\n- Whether María should be involved\n\nHe might also want to discuss what happens if Alfonso reacts badly - what are the contingencies?\n\nDrafting the Letter\n\nÁlvaro pulls out parchment and begins making notes as you speak. \"Good. Emphasizing their voluntary choice at every step is crucial. And that you were ready to accept unspecified oaths but THEY insisted on clarification - that's important.\"\n\nHe looks up from his notes. \"A few questions before I draft the full letter:\n\nFirst - Tone: Should we write this as:\n\nBrother-in-law to brother-in-law (warm, familial, through your connection via María)?\n\nKing to King (more formal, emphasizing the sacred crusade context)?\n\nSomething in between?\n\nSecond - Supporting Documents: Should we include:\n\nWritten testimony from Fray Hernando about his spiritual examination of them?\n\nTestimony from witnesses at the Council (Archbishop of Toledo, Marquis de Santillana)?\n\nA copy of their signed orders sending their troops to Seville?\nThese would prove their willing participation but make the letter bulky.\n\nThird - Your Sister María: Should we:\n\nSend a separate letter to her explaining everything, asking her to help Alfonso understand?\n\nAsk her to be present when Alfonso reads this letter?\n\nKeep her out of it to avoid putting her in the middle?\n\nFourth - Timing and Delivery:\n\nSend it immediately by fastest rider (arrives in about two weeks to Naples)?\n\nWait a day or two to include the Infantes' own letters to their brother explaining their choice?\n\nSend multiple copies by different routes in case one is intercepted?\n\nFifth - The Uncomfortable Truth:\nDo we address directly that this affects succession, or do we avoid mentioning it and let Alfonso draw his own conclusions? Because if we don't mention it, he'll think we're being coy. But if we do mention it, we're acknowledging that we understand the political benefit to you.\"\n\nHe taps his quill. \"My instinct is to be completely transparent. Acknowledge that yes, this affects Aragonese succession. Emphasize that this was never your goal - you were focused on accepting repentant rebels into your crusade. Note that Alfonso is young and may yet father heirs. Suggest that this actually gives him more freedom to choose his succession as he sees fit.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"But I need your guidance on these points before I draft the full letter. What are your thoughts?\""

Separate letter to María noting she's now in succession line\n4. Include the Infantes' own letters to Alfonso\n5. Be transparent about succession but don't offer suggestions - just express confidence Alfonso will handle it\n\nThe user is right that offering \"help\" with succession could be seen as manipulation. Better to just acknowledge the reality and trust Alfonso to figure it out.\n\nNow I should:\n1. Have Álvaro acknowledge these good decisions\n2. Ask about the Infantes writing their letters - should they do it now or tomorrow?\n3. Maybe flag that María being \"in the line of succession\" is actually complex - she's a woman, married to Alfonso, so technically her children would inherit but not her directly\n4. Start working on what these letters might contain\n\nLet me have Álvaro work through this and maybe raise one more question about whether to wait for the Infantes' letters or send the main letter immediately.\n\nLetter Strategy Finalized\n\nÁlvaro nods approvingly as you lay out each decision. \"Good. All of that is sound. The brother-in-law tone makes it personal and shows you're thinking of family, not just kingdoms. The testimonies provide evidence. Including the Infantes' own letters shows transparency and good faith.\"\n\nHe makes more notes, then pauses. \"One thing about María - we should be careful how we phrase this. Technically, as a woman and as Alfonso's wife, she's not directly in the succession line herself. But any children she might bear would be. That's an important distinction. We don't want to sound like we're claiming she has a direct claim to the throne.\"\n\nHe thinks for a moment. \"Though given Alfonso has been married to her for years without producing an heir... that's a delicate subject. Her letter should probably acknowledge that reality gently while noting that the situation has changed and she wanted to ensure he heard the full context from family.\"\n\nThen: \"About the Infantes' letters to their brother - should we ask them to write those tonight, while the emotion of the oaths is still fresh? Or give them a day to compose themselves? Their letters will be more powerful if they capture the genuine spiritual experience they just had, but they're both quite overwhelmed right now.\"\n\nHe looks at you. \"Also, do we review their letters before they're sealed, or do we trust them to write appropriately? I don't think they'll say anything harmful - not after what just happened in that chapel - but it's worth considering.\"\n\nFray Hernando interjects: \"If I may, Your Majesty - I could help them write their letters. Not to control what they say, but to help them articulate the spiritual dimension of their choice. They're both trying to explain something that words barely capture. A confessor's guidance might help them express it clearly.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"That's wise. And it means their letters will emphasize the religious nature of their decision, which is what we want Alfonso to understand.\"\n\nHe organizes his notes. \"So, the plan:\n\nTonight:\n\nI draft your letter to Alfonso\n\nI draft your letter to María\n\nFray Hernando helps the Infantes compose their letters to Alfonso\n\nWe gather written testimonies from witnesses (I can handle that)\n\nTomorrow morning:\n\nYou review all letters and testimonies\n\nMake any revisions needed\n\nSeal everything\n\nSend by fastest riders with multiple copies by different routes\n\nTimeline:\n\nLetters reach Naples in approximately two weeks (late November)\n\nAlfonso reads everything before end of November\n\nHis response returns by mid-to-late December\n\nThat puts his response arriving around the same time as your Portuguese bride.\" He pauses. \"Which is either very good timing or very awkward timing, depending on how he reacts.\"\n\n\"Does this plan work for you, Your Majesty?\""

The letters should arrive by late November.\n\nThe Intervening Month\n\nThe Infantes as Crusaders:\nBoth brothers throw themselves into crusader life. Infante Enrique takes to it naturally - training with the men, attending daily Mass, spending hours in prayer with Brother Guillem. Infante Juan struggles more with the simplicity of it but perseveres, often in deep theological discussions with Fray Hernando.\n\nTheir household troops begin arriving. True to their word, both princes address their men not as lords but as fellow crusaders, releasing any who don't wish to stay. About 800 men choose to join as individual crusaders. The rest return to maintain the estates.\n\nCrusader Growth:\nBy early December, your crusader force has grown to approximately 340 sworn crusaders, properly equipped and trained. The clasp ceremony becomes a regular occurrence - each Friday after Mass, new crusaders receive their iron clasps before the banner.\n\nNo Response from Alfonso:\nAs of December 14th, no reply has arrived from Naples. The letters should have reached him by late November. His silence is... notable. Either he's still processing, or his response is delayed by winter weather, or he's composing a very carefully worded reply.\n\nCrusade Preparations:\nPlans are being drawn up for the Granada campaign. Reconnaissance of the frontier. Negotiations with the Military Orders about their commitments. Financial arrangements for sustaining a long campaign.\n\nMarriage Preparations:\nThe cathedral is being prepared. Guest accommodations arranged. The wedding feast planned for late January or early February, giving the princess time to rest after her journey and allowing you both to become acquainted.\n\nDecember 14, 1430 - Morning\n\nA rider arrives at dawn from the coastal watchtower. \"Your Majesty! Portuguese ships sighted! Eight galleys flying the royal standard! They'll reach the Guadalquivir's mouth by midday!\"\n\nThe city erupts in activity. Your future bride is arriving.\n\nBy noon, you stand at the stone pier where the Guadalquivir meets the sea, just outside Seville. With you are:\n\nÁlvaro de Luna in his finest court dress\n\nFray Hernando in clean Hieronymite robes\n\nCaptain Fernán and twenty royal guards in polished armor\n\nA dozen important nobles who've been waiting for this moment\n\nArchbishop of Seville in full regalia\n\nCrowds of Sevillanos lining the waterfront\n\nThe weather is cold but clear - perfect winter sunshine making the river sparkle.\n\nThe Portuguese fleet appears around the bend. Eight galleys in formation, green and white banners streaming. The lead galley is clearly the royal vessel - larger, more ornate, with the Portuguese coat of arms prominent.\n\nAs it draws closer, you can make out figures on deck. Ladies-in-waiting in fine dress. Portuguese nobles. Guards in Portuguese livery. And one figure standing at the bow, smaller than the others, wrapped in a dark blue traveling cloak edged with fur against the cold.\n\nThe galley begins its approach to the pier. Sailors move efficiently, preparing to dock. The figure at the bow pushes back her hood.\n\nYour first glimpse of Princess Isabel of Portugal:\n\nShe's fifteen years old - young, as expected. Dark hair pulled back in a style that's clearly Portuguese fashion. Her face is pale from the sea journey but composed. Even from a distance, there's something in how she carries herself - not the easy confidence of someone raised at court, but something more careful. Watchful.\n\nShe sees you standing on the pier - there's no mistaking who you are, given the reception - and her expression remains neutral. Not cold, but reserved. Studying you just as you're studying her.\n\nThe galley draws alongside the pier. Ropes are thrown, secured. A gangplank is positioned.\n\nA Portuguese nobleman - clearly the senior escort - descends first and approaches you, bowing deeply. \"Your Majesty, King Juan of Castile, I present to you Her Royal Highness Princess Isabel of Portugal, your betrothed.\"\n\nThe princess begins to descend the gangplank. She moves carefully in her traveling clothes, one hand on the rail. Two ladies-in-waiting follow close behind.\n\nShe reaches the pier and stops three paces from you. Up close, you can see more detail: brown eyes, darker than yours. A dusting of freckles across her nose that no amount of powder quite hides. She's watching you intently, and there's intelligence in that gaze - she's assessing you just as carefully as any diplomat would.\n\nShe curtsies - deep, formal, perfectly executed. When she rises, she speaks. Her voice is steady, with a Portuguese accent:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am honored to meet you at last. I thank you for your welcome and for the alliance our marriage will bring between our kingdoms.\"\n\nThe formal words. The expected greeting. But her eyes never leave your face, still studying, still trying to understand who you are.\n\nEveryone on the pier is watching to see how you respond to your future bride.\n\nWhat do you do?"

She's trying to assess Juan just as he's assessing her. She would be nervous but well-trained in court protocol.\n\nI should stop when it's natural for Juan to speak again or when a question is asked.\n\nThe First Meeting\n\nPrincess Isabel's eyes widen slightly when you take her hand - the first real reaction breaking through her composed exterior. Your lips brush the back of her hand, and you feel a slight tremor. Nerves, cold, or both.\n\nWhen you ask her to walk, she hesitates for just a fraction of a second. Her eyes dart to her Portuguese escort - an older nobleman who gives a barely perceptible nod - then back to you.\n\n\"I would be honored, Your Majesty,\" she says.\n\nYou offer your arm. She takes it after another tiny hesitation, her hand resting lightly on your sleeve. Her ladies-in-waiting move to follow, but Álvaro smoothly intercepts them with perfect courtesy.\n\n\"My ladies, perhaps you would allow me to escort you to the palace? The Archbishop will bless the princess's arrival, and there are refreshments prepared. His Majesty and the princess will join us shortly.\"\n\nIt's done gracefully enough that no one can object. The Portuguese escort looks like he wants to protest - leaving the princess alone with you so soon - but protocol prevents it.\n\nYou begin walking along the waterfront path, away from the crowd. Two of Captain Fernán's guards follow at a discreet distance, far enough to give privacy but close enough to maintain propriety.\n\nFor the first few steps, Isabel is silent. She's shorter than you expected - the top of her head barely reaches your shoulder. She walks carefully, adjusting to solid ground after weeks at sea.\n\nFinally, she speaks, her voice quieter now that you're away from the formal reception: \"Your city is beautiful from the water. The cathedral... I have never seen anything so large.\"\n\nA safe observation. Polite. But there's genuine curiosity in her voice.\n\nShe glances up at you, then quickly away. \"The journey was... long. Twelve days. The sea was rough past Cape Saint Vincent.\" She's making small talk, filling the silence, but you can feel the tension in her arm where it rests on yours.\n\nAfter a moment: \"Your letter was very kind, Your Majesty. About... about looking forward to meeting me.\" She stumbles slightly over the words, as if uncertain whether to reference your correspondence."

So that's... that's good.\"\n\nShe catches herself, seems to realize she's being less formal than she should be, and her expression becomes more guarded again. But something has shifted.

Juan meets her with complete honesty about what she's entering: near civil war, crusade lasting approximately ten years, a kingdom constantly at war. Isabel is initially overwhelmed — her father hadn't fully explained. Juan kneels before her, promising she'll be a real partner, not just a 'pretty face and a womb.' She reveals her love of reading (history, philosophy, theology) and desire to be useful. GREAT SUCCESS roll — Isabel transforms from terrified and defensive to genuinely hopeful, asking excited questions about books and the city. She gives a public speech in carefully learned Castilian. The foundation of a real partnership is established.",

That is in God's hands only and I will never blame you either way. \nAs for being a mother...I was very young when I was crowned king, never did know much about being a good one.

She's fifteen, emotional, scared, but also clearly intelligent and capable of recognizing genuine care. His admission that he says the wrong things and his own vulnerability about becoming king young would probably resonate with her.\n\nI should show her calming down, appreciating his kindness, maybe even finding some humor or lightness in the moment. This is a good bonding moment between them.\n\nA Moment of Understanding\n\nIsabel lets out a shaky laugh through her tears - half sob, half genuine amusement. \"You're apologizing to me for saying the wrong thing? Your Majesty, I just told my future husband that I'm terrified and don't know what I'm doing. That's probably not what you wanted to hear on our first meeting either.\"\n\nShe wipes her eyes again, more composed now. \"I'm sorry. I don't usually cry like this. My mother would be mortified. 'A princess maintains dignity at all times,' she always says.\" She mimics her mother's stern voice slightly, then gives you a watery smile. \"I'm not doing very well at that right now, am I?\"\n\nShe takes a deep breath, steadying herself. \"You're kind. Kinder than I expected. That's... that's good.\" She looks out at the river for a moment, gathering her thoughts. \"I think maybe we're both just trying to figure out what we're doing. You became king young, I'm becoming a queen young. Neither of us really knows how any of this works.\"\n\nShe looks back at you, and there's something softer in her expression now - the defensive walls lowered slightly. \"Can I ask you something? And will you answer honestly, not just what you think I want to hear?\"\n\nShe doesn't wait for permission, the question tumbling out: \"Are you nervous too? About the wedding, about... everything?

Last month I had to supress a rebellion that was on the brink of causing civil war or even worse, war with Aragon as well. I have now stripped the main rebels, the brothers of the king of Aragon of all titles, eliminating them as threats to my rule, but now this puts Aragon in a difficult position and may well become hostile towards us because of how we treated the kings brothers.\n\n\nAm I nervous about the wedding? Honestly? Not at all. I am much more nervous about being a good host and later a good husband to you. And I do take you and your happiness very seriously.

Probably a bit alarmed about the Aragon situation (her marriage is supposed to secure alliances, not happen amid potential wars)\n3. Impressed that he's trusting her with this information\n4. Trying to process what this means for her role\n\nShe's intelligent and educated (as she mentioned), so she would understand the political implications. She's also young and inexperienced, so this is a lot to take in.\n\nJuan's comment about being nervous about being a good host and husband, but not about the wedding itself, is sweet and shows his priorities are on her wellbeing rather than the ceremony.\n\nLet me have Isabel respond in a way that shows:\n- Her intelligence and political understanding\n- Her youth and inexperience\n- Her growing trust in Juan\n- Her processing of this heavy information\n- Perhaps some concern but also appreciation for his honesty\n\nIsabel Processes the Truth\n\nIsabel's eyes widen. She stops walking again, staring at you with an expression that cycles through surprise, alarm, and then something like respect.\n\n\"You just... you're telling me this? Now?\" She looks around as if checking that no one else is listening, though your guards are still at a respectful distance. \"Your Majesty, we've known each other for ten minutes and you're already sharing state secrets with me?\"\n\nShe's quiet for a moment, clearly trying to process everything you just said. When she speaks again, her voice is more serious, older somehow: \"The King of Aragon's brothers. That would be Infante Juan and Infante Enrique. They're... they were in the succession line after King Alfonso.\"\n\nHer education shows - she knows the political landscape. \"If you've stripped them of titles, then Aragon has no clear heir. King Alfonso has no children with your sister Queen María, so...\" She trails off, working through the implications.\n\nThen she looks at you directly. \"Your Majesty, my marriage to you was supposed to secure Portugal's alliance with a stable Castile. But if Aragon becomes hostile, if there's war...\" Fear flickers across her face. \"My father sent me here thinking I'd be safe. That I'd be a queen in a peaceful kingdom.\"\n\nBut then she catches herself, straightens slightly. \"I'm sorry. That sounded accusatory. I didn't mean... It's just a lot to take in.\" She pauses. \"But you trusted me with this information. You didn't pretend everything was perfect. That means something.\"\n\nShe looks down, then back up at you. \"Is this why you want a family so badly? Because everything else is so uncertain and dangerous? Because family is something... real?\"\n\nHer voice softens. \"And you're worried about being a good husband to me. While dealing with all of that.\" She shakes her head slightly. \"Your Majesty, I think maybe you're allowed to be nervous about the wedding too. It's... it's a lot.\"\n\nShe takes your arm again, this time more firmly. \"But thank you. For being honest. For not treating me like I'm just decoration who can't handle the truth.\""

She's had a lot thrown at her in this conversation.\n\nThe Full Reality\n\nIsabel goes very still. The color drains from her face.\n\n\"I... my father said you were pious. That you had received a papal blessing for a campaign against Granada.\" Her voice is quieter now. \"He said it was... he made it sound like it would be a few months. Maybe a year. A campaign season.\"\n\nShe's staring at you, and you can see her mind working furiously. \"Most of the coming years?

Like the Templars.\" She looks up at you. \"Your Majesty, those took... some of those took decades. Some crusaders never came home.\"\n\nShe's breathing faster now. \"I thought... I thought being queen meant managing a household. Learning Castilian customs. Bearing children.

Tears are streaming down her face again, but she's not looking away. She's holding your gaze as you make your promise.\n\nWhen you stand, she's trembling. For a long moment she just stares at you, and you can see the war happening behind her eyes - the fifteen-year-old girl who wants to run back to Portugal and safety, versus something else trying to emerge.\n\nFinally, she speaks, and her voice shakes but doesn't break: \"Ten years.

          "text": "What Juan attempted to do:\n- Make Isabel feel more at ease\n- Build trust and openness with his future bride\n- Establish honest communication\n- Create emotional connection\n\nFactors supporting success:\n1. **Honesty and transparency**: Juan was remarkably honest about the political situation, the war, the timeline. This contrasts sharply with what Isabel was told and shows respect for her intelligence.\n\n2. **Vulnerability**: Juan shared his own fears, dreams, and lack of family. He admitted saying \"the wrong things\" and apologized genuinely. He even knelt before her - an extraordinary gesture of humility from a king.\n\n3. **Respect for her intelligence**: He engaged with her as a thinking person, asked about her dreams, acknowledged her education, promised her books. He explicitly said she's \"more than just a pretty face and a womb.\"\n\n4. **Emotional intelligence**: When she started crying, he immediately tried to comfort her rather than being annoyed or dismissive. He met her emotional honesty with his own.\n\n5. **Context**: Isabel is 15, scared, far from home, and was clearly not fully informed about what she was getting into. Juan is 18, also young, and treating her as a partner rather than property.\n\nFactors that could complicate:\n1. **The truth is scary**: Learning that she's marrying into a kingdom on the brink of war with Aragon AND about to wage a 10-year crusade is genuinely terrifying. Some brides might prefer comforting lies.\n\n2. **Cultural expectations**: She's been trained that showing too much emotion or intelligence is inappropriate. Juan encouraging her to be herself might feel destabilizing.\n\n3. **Age and inexperience**: Both are very young. Isabel might still be overwhelmed despite the good conversation.\n\n4. **She's still processing**: This is a lot of information in one conversation.\n\nHowever, looking at Isabel's final response, she:\n\n- Demonstrated remarkable emotional maturity\n- Showed courage in facing difficult truths\n- Recognized the value of genuine partnership\n- Responded to Juan's vulnerability with her own openness\n\nHer actions reveal a young woman who deeply appreciates authenticity and mutual respect. Juan's unconventional approach of treating her as an intelligent, feeling partner perfectly matched her core values. Despite her fear, she chose connection and understanding over retreat or defensiveness.\n\nI assess this as a **High probability of success** - their interaction suggests a profound emotional and intellectual alignment that transcends the typical arranged marriage dynamic.\n\nShe transitioned from a state of fear to cautious hope through a nuanced, respectful exchange. The breakthrough wasn't about complete comfort, but about establishing a foundation of trust and shared commitment to facing challenges together.\n\nProbability Assessment: Making Isabel Feel at Ease\n\nAnalysis\n\nWhat you attempted:\n\nBuild trust through radical honesty\n\nCreate emotional connection and partnership\n\nShow respect for her intelligence and agency\n\nMake her feel valued beyond her political/reproductive function\n\nFactors Supporting Success:\n\nStrong positives:\n\nYour vulnerability was genuine and appropriate (sharing your own family losses, nervousness, mistakes)\n\nYou treated her as an intellectual equal (engaging with her education, promising books, asking about her dreams)\n\nThe gesture of kneeling was extraordinary - kings don't kneel to their brides, showing profound respect\n\nYour honesty, while scary, aligned with what she actually values (she was frustrated at being kept in the dark)\n\nYou acknowledged her fears rather than dismissing them\n\nYou offered concrete support (books, Portuguese ladies, finding ways to help her adjust)\n\nHer response indicators:\n\nShe opened up emotionally despite training to \"maintain dignity\"\n\nShe explicitly thanked you for honesty and not treating her as \"decoration\"\n\nShe moved from defensive/scared to \"I think I want to try\"\n\nShe physically offered her hand to you (not waiting for you to take it)\n\nShe repeated your words about facing things together\n\nMild complications:\n\nThe truth IS genuinely scary (10 years of war, political instability)\n\nShe's still processing a lot of overwhelming information\n\nShe's very young and far from home\n\nOne conversation can't eliminate all anxiety\n\nAssessment: High Probability of Success\n\nThis doesn't mean Isabel is now completely comfortable - that would be unrealistic after one conversation about such heavy topics. But you've achieved something more valuable: you've established trust, respect, and genuine partnership as the foundation of your relationship.\n\nShe went from terrified and defensive to cautiously hopeful and willing to try. She feels informed rather than manipulated, respected rather than used, and like she has a genuine partner rather than just a political arrangement.\n\nExpected outcomes when you roll:\n\nGreat Success: Isabel feels genuinely comfortable with you, begins to see the marriage as something she actively wants rather than just endures, becomes an enthusiastic partner\n\nSuccess: Isabel feels significantly more at ease, trusts you, is willing to face challenges together, anxiety reduced to manageable levels\n\nFailure: Despite good conversation, the reality is too overwhelming; she remains anxious and uncertain, needing more time and support\n\nCatastrophic Failure: Would be very unlikely given her actual responses, but might involve her breaking down completely or requesting to return to Portugal\n\nWhen you're ready, roll and tell me the result."

She's no longer holding your arm with nervous tension - instead, she walks beside you with growing confidence, occasionally pointing at buildings and asking questions about the city.\n\n\"That tower there - is that part of the Alcázar? My tutor showed me drawings of Moorish architecture, but seeing it in person...\" She looks up at you with genuine enthusiasm. \"Could you show me sometime? The real thing, I mean, not just from a distance?\"\n\nWhen you assure her you will, she actually smiles - not the careful, practiced princess smile from earlier, but something real and bright that transforms her face.\n\n\"And you really meant it? About the books?\" She's almost bouncing slightly as she walks now, the fifteen-year-old girl fully present. \"Because there's this treatise on governance by Christine de Pizan - she's French, but she wrote about how women can be counselors to their husbands in matters of state, not just decorative. I've only read excerpts but I'd love to...\" She catches herself, seems to remember where she is. \"Sorry, I'm probably talking too much.\"\n\n\"No,\" you tell her. \"Keep talking.\"\n\nAnd she does. The words pour out - her journey at sea (\"one of the sailors taught me how to identify stars for navigation, my lady-in-waiting was scandalized\"), her siblings (\"my brother Afonso is only two years older but he acts like he's ancient and wise\"), her mother's advice (\"most of it was about not embarrassing the family, very little about actually being happy\").\n\nBy the time you reach the palace courtyard where the formal reception is assembled, she's laughing at something you said about your own education. Her cheeks are flushed from the cold and the walk, her eyes bright. She looks alive in a way she didn't when she stepped off that ship.\n\nThe gathered nobles, clergy, and Portuguese escort are waiting in the courtyard. Álvaro has clearly been managing them expertly - refreshments are being served, the Archbishop is chatting amicably with Portuguese nobility, Isabel's ladies-in-waiting are being shown every courtesy.\n\nBut when Isabel appears beside you, everyone stops and stares.\n\nThe transformation is that visible.\n\nThe Portuguese chief escort - the older nobleman who rode with her from Lisbon - actually does a double-take. He had sent a reserved, frightened girl off on a walk with a foreign king thirty minutes ago. The young woman who returns is glowing.\n\nOne of Isabel's ladies-in-waiting - a woman in her thirties who must be her primary chaperone - hurries forward. \"Your Highness! We were getting worried, you were gone so long...\"\n\n\"Dona Beatriz, it's fine,\" Isabel says, and there's new authority in her voice. Not harsh, but confident. \"His Majesty was showing me the city and we were talking. About books,\" she adds, as if this explains everything.\n\nDona Beatriz looks between you and Isabel with an expression that clearly says she doesn't believe \"books\" is the whole story, but she's too well-trained to press. \"Of course, Your Highness. The Archbishop is ready to perform the blessing when you are.\"\n\nIsabel turns to you, and in front of everyone, she speaks clearly: \"Thank you for walking with me, Your Majesty. For answering my questions. For...\" she pauses, and you can see her choosing her words carefully, \"for making me feel welcome. Truly welcome.\"\n\nThe way she emphasizes \"truly\" - everyone in the courtyard can hear that something significant happened during that walk.\n\nÁlvaro catches your eye from across the courtyard and raises one eyebrow fractionally. Whatever you did, it worked extraordinarily well.\n\nThe Archbishop of Seville steps forward, ready to perform the formal blessing of the princess's arrival. But before the ceremony can begin, Isabel does something unexpected.\n\nShe turns to address the assembled crowd - Portuguese and Castilian alike - in carefully pronounced Castilian with her Portuguese accent: \"I thank you all for this welcome to Seville. I come from Portugal with hope for alliance between our kingdoms and friendship between our peoples. I am honored to be here.\"\n\nIt's a short speech, but the fact that she's giving it at all - that she has the confidence to address a foreign court in their language after just arriving - draws murmurs of approval.\n\nThen she adds, with just a hint of a smile: \"And I look forward to learning much more about this beautiful city and kingdom. His Majesty has promised to teach me.\"\n\nThe way she says it - not demanding, not presumptuous, but with genuine warmth - wins the crowd. You can see nobles nodding approvingly. The Portuguese escort looks relieved. Even stern Dona Beatriz seems to relax slightly.\n\nÁlvaro steps forward smoothly. \"Your Highness honors us with her words and presence. Now, if Your Majesty and Your Highness would join the Archbishop, we can proceed with the blessing.\"\n\nAs you and Isabel move toward where the Archbishop waits with his ceremonial robes and holy water, she whispers to you - quiet enough that only you can hear:\n\n\"Thank you. For not lying to me. For treating me like I have a mind. That... that changed everything.\"\n\nThen she straightens, puts on her formal princess demeanor for the religious ceremony, but you can see it now - the confidence underneath. The beginning of real partnership.\n\nThe blessing proceeds smoothly. Afterward, there will be a formal welcome feast. But the crucial first impression has been made - and it went far better than anyone could have hoped.\n\nWhat would you like to do next? The evening stretches ahead with the welcome feast, and tomorrow you'll need to show Isabel her new home and begin introducing her to court life."

Opposing papal-backed decisions becomes challenging, especially with Alfonso's ongoing Naples military campaign.\n\n**Alfonso's strategic responses range from:**\n- Graceful acceptance\n- Cold diplomatic distancing\n- Negotiating renunciation terms\n- Subtle political maneuvering\n\n**Likely outcome:** Given Alfonso's pragmatic nature and the transparent, documented rebellion, he'll probably accept the situation strategically, prioritizing his Italian ambitions over Castilian family drama.\n\nHe'll maintain formal relations but with noticeable emotional distance. Juan successfully navigates a complex political landscape, removing Alfonso's heirs while avoiding open conflict. Alfonso watches carefully, preserving diplomatic channels but remaining wary of potential future manipulations.\n\nThe resolution represents a calculated political compromise - Juan gains significant advantage without triggering active hostility, while Alfonso preserves his broader strategic interests.\n\nThe nuanced outcome reflects the delicate diplomatic maneuvering, where Juan's actions, though potentially provocative, remain within acceptable political boundaries.\n\nProbability Assessment: Maintaining Relations with Alfonso V\n\nAnalysis\n\nWhat you attempted:\n\nMaintain good relations with King Alfonso V of Aragon\n\nFrame the Infantes' renunciation as their genuine spiritual choice, not your manipulation\n\nAvoid appearing to be making a power grab for Aragonese succession\n\nPrevent hostility or threats of war\n\nThe Objective Reality (Impossible to Escape):\n\nRegardless of how it happened, you just removed Alfonso's heirs from the line of succession to his throne. He's been married to your sister for years without producing children. His brothers were his backup plan. Now that backup plan is gone, and you - or your potential children - are suddenly much closer to inheriting Aragon.\n\nNo amount of good letter-writing can make that fundamental political reality disappear.\n\nFactors Supporting Success:\n\nVery strong positives:\n\nComplete transparency: Full testimonies, witness statements, the Infantes' own emotional letters\n\nSacred context: Oaths sworn before the True Cross and Santiago's bone - extremely hard to dismiss as mere politics\n\nIndependent verification: Fray Hernando's testimony, Archbishop of Toledo's witness\n\nThe Infantes' own words: Their letters describing their profound spiritual experience make it hard to claim coercion\n\nYour oath to protect Carlos: Shows you're not trying to destroy the family\n\nLegitimate rebellion: The Infantes DID rebel, seize fortresses, plot - Alfonso knows this\n\nBrother-in-law approach: Personal, familial tone through María\n\nImmediate sending: Nothing hidden, no delay suggesting calculation\n\nPapal backing: Alfonso received letters from Pope supporting your crusade - hard to oppose you when Rome backs you\n\nAlfonso's priorities: Historically focused on Naples/Italy, not deeply invested in Castilian politics\n\nTiming: You acted immediately, didn't wait for Alfonso's response before sending letters\n\nFactors Working Against Success:\n\nSignificant negatives:\n\nThe result benefits you enormously: Even if sincere, it looks like brilliant political maneuvering\n\nFamily loyalty: These are Alfonso's brothers - he may feel protective even if they were wrong\n\nSuccession crisis: You just created a major problem for Aragon's future\n\nPermanent renunciation: \"For themselves and their entire line\" - this removes Carlos too, forever\n\nPressure from Aragonese nobles: They'll push Alfonso to respond forcefully to protect their kingdom's interests\n\nSuspicion of calculation: Smart rulers will wonder if you engineered this outcome somehow\n\nMaría's childless marriage: Already a sensitive topic - this makes it more painful\n\nThe timing after Barcelona: He gave tacit approval for crusade, then this happens - might feel manipulated\n\nAlfonso's Realistic Options:\n\nHe can:\n\nAccept it gracefully (unlikely - too politically damaging to look weak)\n\nAccept it coldly (most likely - maintain relations but with wariness)\n\nDemand modifications (possible - try to protect Carlos's place in succession)\n\nMake threats (possible - saber-rattling without actual war)\n\nActive hostility (unlikely - against his interests, too extreme)\n\nWhy Success is Likely (But Not Guaranteed):\n\nThe letters were as good as they could possibly be. You did everything right diplomatically. The sacred context is genuine and powerful. Alfonso's own priorities lie elsewhere. The Infantes were legitimately guilty.\n\nBut you're asking Alfonso to accept that his brothers voluntarily removed themselves and their descendants from succession to his throne, right after being guests at your court, right after you showed them the most sacred relics in Christendom.\n\nEven with perfect execution, that's a hard sell.\n\nAssessment: LIKELY TO SUCCEED\n\nThis means maintaining formal relations and avoiding active hostility, but NOT necessarily gaining Alfonso's warm support or enthusiasm.\n\nExpected outcomes when you roll:\n\nGreat Success: Alfonso accepts gracefully, maintains warm relations, continues crusade support, perhaps even acknowledges the situation's complexity with understanding\n\nSuccess: Alfonso accepts with coolness and wariness, maintains formal relations, no threats of war, continues nominal crusade support, but relationship has definitely cooled\n\nFailure: Alfonso responds with anger and threats (though not actual war), demands modifications or concessions, relationship significantly damaged, withdraws crusade support\n\nCatastrophic Failure: Alfonso declares the oaths invalid, demands his brothers be released, threatens war, actively works to undermine you, major diplomatic crisis\n\nWhen you're ready, roll and tell me the result."

          "text": "\"Alfonso accepts with coolness and wariness, maintains formal relations, no threats of war, continues nominal crusade support, but relationship has definitely cooled\"\n\nI need to draft Alfonso's response letter that shows:\n1. He accepts what happened (doesn't challenge the oaths)\n2. He's clearly unhappy about it\n3. He maintains formal diplomatic relations\n4. There's no threat of war\n5. The warmth has gone out of the relationship\n6. He's wary and calculating\n\nThe letter should be from Alfonso to Juan, arriving around mid-to-late December (the user said Isabel arrives December 14, so maybe December 18-20 for Alfonso's response).\n\nAlfonso would likely:\n- Acknowledge receiving all the letters and testimonies\n- Accept the validity of the sacred oaths (can't really challenge them)\n- Express displeasure about the succession implications\n- Note that this creates difficulties for Aragon\n- Perhaps make some pointed comments about timing and convenience\n- Maintain formal correctness while being notably cool\n- Reference María (his wife, Juan's sister) to remind of family connection\n- Perhaps mention he'll need to consider his succession carefully now\n- No explicit threats but make clear he's watching carefully\n\nThen I need to describe the scene in Seville when this letter arrives and how Juan and his advisors respond to it.\n\nThe Response from Aragon\n\nDate: December 18, 1430\nLocation: Royal Palace, Seville\n\nThe Letter Arrives\n\nYou're in the palace library with Princess Isabel, showing her the collection of books as promised, when Álvaro arrives with an urgent expression. He carries a sealed letter bearing the royal seal of Aragon.\n\n\"Your Majesty, from Naples. King Alfonso's response.\"\n\nIsabel notices the shift in atmosphere immediately. \"Should I leave?\" she asks quietly.\n\nYou gesture for her to stay. \"You're my betrothed. You should understand what's happening.\" She settles into a chair nearby, watching intently as you break the seal.\n\nAlfonso V's Letter\n\nTo Our Beloved Brother-in-Law, Juan II, by the Grace of God King of Castile and León,\n\nWe have received Your letters dated November 13th, along with the numerous testimonies, witness statements, and letters from Our brothers Infante Juan and Infante Enrique. We have read everything with great care and attention, as befits matters of such gravity.\n\nWe acknowledge that Our brothers did rebel against Your rightful authority. We acknowledge that they seized fortresses and conspired to undermine Your rule. For this, they deserved punishment, and We did not object when You summoned them to face justice.\n\nWe also acknowledge the testimonies of Father Hernando de Talavera, the Archbishop of Toledo, the Marquis de Santillana, and numerous other witnesses regarding what occurred at Your Council on November 8th and subsequently in Your chapel on November 12th. The accounts are consistent and detailed. Our brothers' own letters describe profound spiritual experiences that moved them to renounce worldly ambition.\n\nWe do not question the sincerity of their religious conversion. We do not doubt they touched sacred relics and felt moved by grace. We do not challenge the validity of oaths sworn before the True Cross and the bone of Santiago.\n\nHowever, We must note with considerable concern that these sacred oaths, however sincerely made, have created significant complications for the Crown of Aragon.\n\nOur brothers have renounced all claims to Our throne \"for themselves and their entire line forever.\" This includes Our nephew Carlos, currently King of Navarre, who until these oaths was heir to Aragon after his father. We have been married to Your sister, Our beloved wife María, for many years. God has not yet blessed us with children. The succession of Aragon is now uncertain.\n\nWe find it remarkable - though We accept it was unintended - that these renunciations occurred while Our brothers were guests at Your court, immediately after You showed them relics of extraordinary spiritual power, and resulted in outcomes that significantly benefit Your position and that of any children You may have.\n\nWe do not accuse You of manipulation. The testimonies are too consistent, too detailed, too sacred in nature. But We would be a poor king if We did not note how convenient the timing and results have proven for Castile's interests.\n\nYour oath to protect Our nephew Carlos as King of Navarre is noted and appreciated. We will hold You to that oath should circumstances require it.\n\nRegarding Your crusade against Granada: We acknowledge the papal bull grants You supreme authority over this endeavor. We will not interfere with Your holy work. However, given recent developments, We must focus Our attention and resources on securing Our position in Naples and considering Our succession more carefully. We cannot provide the level of support for Your crusade that We might have offered under different circumstances.\n\nWe maintain formal diplomatic relations between Aragon and Castile. Our wife, Your sister María, continues to hold Our affection and respect, and through her We remain connected as family. But We are King of Aragon first, and We must safeguard Our kingdom's interests.\n\nWe expect regular correspondence to keep Us informed of developments in Castile, particularly regarding Our brothers' service in Your crusade and the well-being of Our nephew Carlos. We hope their redemption through holy service proves genuine.\n\nWe wish You success in Your crusade and happiness in Your forthcoming marriage to the Portuguese princess.\n\nGiven at Naples, December 10th, in the Year of Our Lord 1430\n\nALFONSO, by the Grace of God King of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia, and Corsica, Count of Barcelona\n\nThe Reaction\n\nYou finish reading and hand the letter to Álvaro, who reads it quickly, his expression darkening.\n\n\"Well,\" Álvaro says carefully, \"it could have been worse. No threats of war. No demands that the oaths be invalidated. No cutting of diplomatic ties.\"\n\n\"But?\" you prompt.\n\n\"But he's angry. Wary. And he's made it clear he won't support the crusade as he might have otherwise.\" Álvaro sets the letter down. \"The line about 'convenient timing' - that's as close to an accusation as he can make without directly challenging sacred oaths sworn before the True Cross.\"\n\nIsabel speaks up from her chair, her voice thoughtful: \"He accepted what happened but made sure everyone knows he's watching. He's protecting himself politically. His nobles would expect him to respond firmly, but he can't attack you without challenging sacred vows. So he did the smart thing - accepted it coldly while making clear the relationship has changed.\"\n\nBoth you and Álvaro turn to look at her. She flushes slightly. \"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...\"\n\n\"No,\" you say. \"That's exactly right. Keep going.\"\n\nShe straightens, emboldened. \"He mentioned my father - 'happiness in your forthcoming marriage to the Portuguese princess.' That's deliberate. He's reminding you that you're making alliances while he's isolated. And the bit about 'regular correspondence' and keeping informed about his brothers and Carlos - that's not a request. That's him saying he'll be watching everything you do with them.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods slowly. \"The Portuguese princess is perceptive.\" Then to you: \"She's right. Alfonso is a skilled diplomat. This letter maintains the forms while making his displeasure unmistakable. He won't actively oppose you, but he won't help either. And if you make any mistake with his brothers or Carlos, he'll have justification to act.\"\n\nYou walk to the window, looking out over Seville. \"So we've secured the Infantes' submission and eliminated them as threats, but at the cost of Alfonso's active support.\"\n\n\"And created uncertainty about Aragonese succession,\" Álvaro adds. \"Which benefits you in the long term but makes Alfonso deeply suspicious in the short term.\"\n\nIsabel stands and approaches you carefully. \"Your Majesty, may I ask something? This situation with King Alfonso and his brothers - is this related to why you were so honest with me about the difficulties ahead?\"\n\nYou turn to look at her. She continues: \"Because it seems to me that being honest, even when the truth is uncomfortable, is better than trying to hide things and having people discover them later. King Alfonso is angry partly because of what happened, but at least you told him everything immediately. If he'd learned about it through rumors or from someone else...\" She trails off.\n\nÁlvaro looks at her with new respect. \"Your Highness, you've been in Castile for four days and you already understand more about politics than some nobles who've been at court for years.\"\n\nIsabel blushes but doesn't retreat. \"I just think... if King Alfonso had discovered this from spies or gossip, he'd have reason to believe Your Majesty was hiding it because of guilt or manipulation. But because you sent complete testimonies immediately, he has to acknowledge it was genuine, even if he doesn't like the results.\"\n\nShe's right. The letter makes clear Alfonso is unhappy but accepts the fundamental truth of what happened. The relationship has cooled, but it hasn't broken.\n\nLater That Evening\n\nAfter Isabel retires to her chambers with her ladies, you meet with Álvaro and Fray Hernando privately.\n\n\"The situation with Alfonso is stable,\" Álvaro assesses. \"Not good, not warm, but stable. He won't move against us while we're prosecuting a papal crusade. That would make him look like he's opposing God's work.\"\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"The oaths his brothers swore are binding before God. Alfonso knows this. Whatever political complications they created, they cannot be undone without sacrilege. He's accepted that reality.\"\n\n\"But he's watching,\" you note. \"Every move we make with the Infantes or Carlos, he'll be scrutinizing.\"\n\n\"Then we make sure they're treated honorably,\" Fray Hernando says simply. \"The Infantes are proving to be genuine crusaders. Let their service speak for itself. And if young Carlos ever needs help, you honor your oath to protect him. Alfonso will see that you're keeping your word.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"In the long term, this may actually work in our favor. Alfonso is focused on Naples. He has no heir. Your marriage to Isabel will soon produce children. By the time succession becomes urgent in Aragon - years from now - your position will be much stronger, your crusade successful, your heirs established.\"\n\n\"And if Alfonso fathers a son?\" you ask.\n\n\"Then your children marry his children and we unite the kingdoms that way,\" Álvaro says practically. \"There are multiple paths forward. The important thing is that we haven't created an enemy. Just a wary family member who will need careful management.\"\n\nFray Hernando speaks quietly: \"Your Majesty, you've handled this with honor. You could have hidden what happened or lied about it. Instead, you sent complete truth immediately. Alfonso may be unhappy, but he cannot accuse you of dishonesty or manipulation. That matters before God, even if it doesn't immediately benefit you politically.\"\n\nYou think about Isabel's observation - that honesty, even uncomfortable honesty, builds more trust than trying to hide difficult truths.\n\nStatus Update: Relations with Aragon\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\nFormal relations maintained - no diplomatic break, no threats of war\n\nActive support withdrawn - Alfonso focused on Naples, not helping crusade\n\nWary surveillance - Alfonso watching how you treat his brothers and nephew\n\nFamily connection preserved - Through María, personal link remains\n\nSacred oaths accepted - Alfonso cannot challenge them without sacrilege\n\nLong-term uncertainty - Succession question unresolved but not urgent\n\nPractical Impact:\n\nNo Aragonese troops or resources for Granada crusade\n\nNo interference with crusade either\n\nBorder between Castile and Aragon remains peaceful\n\nMust be careful in all dealings with Infantes and Carlos\n\nFuture opportunities remain if handled well\n\nThe Assessment:\nYou've secured your flanks. Alfonso is unhappy but not hostile. The Infantes are committed crusaders. The succession question creates long-term possibilities. You've paid a price in warmth of relations, but avoided war and maintained essential stability.\n\nAnd your new bride has already proven she understands the political complexity of your situation.\n\nWhat would you like to focus on next? The wedding is approaching (late January/early February), the crusade must be prepared, and there are still months of winter before campaign season begins."
