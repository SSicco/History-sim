          "text": "**Factors AGAINST the Sultan knowing (PROS for secrecy):**\n1. King Juan has taken deliberate precautions to keep plans secret (as stated)\n2. The mobilization is happening relatively quickly (from Chapter 8 in November to March departure)\n3. Council of Seville was closed-door with trusted nobles\n4. Winter months may have limited travel and intelligence gathering\n5. The crusade preparations are happening in Castilian territory, not on the border\n\n**Factors FOR the Sultan knowing (CONS for secrecy):**\n1. Massive troop mobilization is hard to hide - armies gathering, supplies being moved\n2. Granada has historically maintained spy networks in Castile\n3. Merchants, travelers, and border communities would see the activity\n4. Some Castilian nobles may have loose tongues or disloyal servants\n5. The papal bull was a public document that would have been read in churches\n6. Mudéjar (Muslim) communities in Castile could pass information\n7. It's been 4+ months since the Council (November to late March) - plenty of time for rumors\n8. Granada would naturally be vigilant after the 1429 raid\n\nLet me search the project knowledge to understand what preparations have been made and what context exists from previous chapters.\n\nI'll search the project knowledge to understand the context of your preparations and the situation with Granada before drafting the intelligence table.\n\nPerfect. Now I have comprehensive context. Let me search for any final details about the current situation, Granada's intelligence capabilities, and what specific secrecy measures have been taken.\n\n**AGAINST the Sultan knowing (PROS for Castilian secrecy):**\n1. Juan has explicitly taken precautions to keep plans secret\n2. The Council of Seville was closed-door with trusted nobles\n3. Winter months (November to March) limit travel and intelligence gathering\n4. Two-army strategy is secret - only inner circle knows\n5. Naval preparations in Seville could be mistaken for routine trade\n6. Western army assembly could be seen as supply operations for eastern army\n7. Staggered deployment means western preparations deliberately delayed\n\n**FOR the Sultan knowing (CONS for secrecy):**\n1. The papal bull was a PUBLIC document, read in churches across Castile\n2. Massive troop mobilization (23,000 east, 12,000 west) is impossible to hide\n3. 4+ months since Council of Seville - plenty of time for rumors\n4. Granada historically maintains spy networks in Castile\n5. Mudéjar communities in Castile could pass information\n6. Merchants, travelers, and border communities see military buildup\n7. Some nobles may have loose tongues or disloyal servants\n8. Artillery movement with 40 oxen per gun is highly visible\n9. 30 ships contracted for western fleet would be noticed\n10. Mass recruitment of 500+ crusaders creates talk\n11. The Granada diplomatic mission that came in September 1430 likely left spies\n12. Border fortifications and supply depot construction visible\n13. Noble levy summons in February were formal documents\n14. Multiple relay stations established between armies\n\nBased on Chapter 4, we know Granada already had some intelligence capability - they intercepted correspondence between Juan and Álvaro. They also sent a diplomatic mission in late September 1430, which likely included intelligence gathering.\n\nFrom Chapter 14, Master Pedro says \"Granada aware something coming but not the scale\" and \"Sultan concentrated forces near Granada city and western approaches\" and \"Expects main thrust west (historical pattern).\"\n\nI'll design a nuanced intelligence table that captures the Sultan's partial awareness. The table will reflect his limited but not insignificant knowledge - aware of impending conflict but missing critical strategic details. The outcomes will range from minimal intelligence to substantial but incomplete information, with most results clustering around partial awareness.\n\nExcellent. I have the context I need. Let me draft a d100 intelligence table for what Sultan Muhammad IX knows about the crusade preparations.\n\nSultan's Intelligence: What Granada Knows About the Crusade\n\nFactors Favoring Castilian Secrecy (PROS):\n\nJuan took explicit precautions to maintain operational security\n\nCouncil of Seville was closed-door with trusted nobles only\n\nWinter months (Nov-March) limited travel and intelligence gathering\n\nTwo-army strategy known only to inner circle\n\nNaval preparations could be mistaken for merchant activity\n\nWestern army deliberately delayed to hide its purpose\n\nStaggered deployment conceals coordination\n\nFactors Against Castilian Secrecy (CONS):\n\nPapal bull was PUBLIC document, read in churches across Castile\n\nMassive mobilization (35,000 total troops) impossible to hide completely\n\n4+ months since Council = time for rumors to spread\n\nGranada's historical spy networks in Castile\n\nMudéjar communities could pass information\n\nMerchants, travelers, border communities see buildup\n\nArtillery with 40 oxen per gun highly visible\n\n30 ships contracted for western fleet noticeable\n\n500+ crusaders recruited creates widespread talk\n\nGranadan diplomatic mission (Sept 1430) likely left spies behind\n\nBorder supply depots and fortifications visible\n\nNoble levy summons (February) were formal, distributed documents\n\nRelay stations between armies observable\n\nFrom Chapter 14 Intelligence:\nMaster Pedro reported Granada \"aware something coming but not the scale\" and Sultan \"expects main thrust west (historical pattern)\" and \"doesn't realize 23,000-troop eastern offensive.\"\n\nD100 Table: Sultan Muhammad IX's Intelligence on the Crusade\n\n1-8: ALMOST BLIND (Critical Success for Juan's Secrecy)\n\nSultan knows only that:\n\nSome kind of crusade is being prepared (papal bull was public)\n\nJuan recruited crusaders and raised funds\n\nGeneral mobilization happening somewhere in Castile\n\nHe does NOT know:\n\nScale of forces (might estimate 8,000-12,000 total)\n\nAssembly locations\n\nTimeline for campaign launch\n\nExistence of two separate armies\n\nNaval component\n\nArtillery presence\n\nSpecific strategic objectives\n\nGranada's Response: Forces remain dispersed in traditional defensive positions. No special preparations beyond what was done in August-September 1430. Sultan may even be complacent, thinking crusade is distant or small.\n\n9-25: MINIMAL INTELLIGENCE (Strong Success for Secrecy)\n\nSultan knows:\n\nCrusade definitely launching spring 1431\n\nJuan personally leading with papal backing\n\nMobilization in both Jaén region and Andalusia\n\nForce size roughly 15,000-20,000 total (underestimate)\n\nCrusaders include veterans and nobles\n\nHe does NOT know:\n\nTrue scale (35,000 troops across both armies)\n\nTwo-army coordination and staggered deployment\n\nNaval invasion plan\n\nArtillery (5 bombards)\n\nSpecific targets beyond \"frontier fortresses\"\n\nTiming of western naval assault relative to eastern advance\n\nGranada's Response: Concentrates moderate forces (12,000-14,000) near Granada city and central frontier. Maintains strong western coastal garrisons. Moderate alert level. Some reinforcement of key frontier castles.\n\n26-50: PARTIAL INTELLIGENCE (Moderate Success for Secrecy)\n\nSultan knows:\n\nMajor crusade launching early April 1431\n\nLarge eastern army (~20,000) assembling at Jaén\n\nSmaller western force (~8,000-10,000) at Seville\n\nJuan leading eastern army personally with banner and relics\n\nArtillery present (though may not know exact number)\n\nCrusader force of several hundred elite troops\n\nGeneral objective: penetrate toward Granada heartland\n\nHe does NOT know:\n\nTrue western force size (thinks 8-10K, actually 12K)\n\nNaval component of western strategy\n\nTwo-army coordination system and relay network\n\nStaggered deployment (western waits for eastern commitment signal)\n\n3,000 cavalry raiders as mobile screening force\n\nSpecific siege targets and operational plans\n\nGranada's Response: Major force (16,000-18,000) concentrated against eastern approach, since that's where banner and Juan are. Maintains strong western defenses (6,000-8,000). High alert. All frontier castles reinforced and supplied. Calls for additional North African reinforcements. Prepares for prolonged campaign.\n\n51-70: SUBSTANTIAL INTELLIGENCE (Moderate Failure for Secrecy)\n\nSultan knows:\n\nTwo major armies: ~23,000 east (Jaén) and ~12,000 west (Seville)\n\nEastern army has banner, relics, Juan II personally commanding\n\nWestern army has naval support component\n\nArtillery present (5 bombards with eastern force)\n\nCampaign launching early April, 8-month duration planned\n\n500+ crusaders including experienced commanders\n\n3,000 cavalry organized for raiding operations\n\nFour forward supply depots supporting eastern army\n\nMilitary Orders fully committed (4,500 troops)\n\nHe does NOT know:\n\nStaggered deployment strategy (western delays for eastern commitment)\n\nRelay communication system between armies\n\nSpecific coordination plan forcing him to divide forces\n\nExact timing of western naval assault\n\nDetailed siege plans and specific fortress targets\n\nFull extent of supply preparations and quartermaster efficiency\n\nGranada's Response: Faces the dilemma Juan intended. Knows both threats but unsure which is primary. Most likely concentrates majority (18,000-20,000) against eastern army since Juan, banner, and relics are there. Leaves (6,000-8,000) defending west/coast. Urgently requests maximum North African reinforcements. Prepares Granada city for potential siege. May attempt preemptive strikes against supply depots.\n\n71-85: DETAILED INTELLIGENCE (Significant Failure for Secrecy)\n\nSultan knows everything from 51-70, PLUS:\n\nWestern army deliberately timed to launch AFTER eastern army commits\n\nRelay system between armies for coordination\n\nStrategic intent: force Granada into unsolvable dilemma\n\nWestern force will launch 3-5 days after eastern army fully deployed\n\nSpecific high-value targets (major fortresses, key coastal cities)\n\nInfante Juan commanding in west, Infante Enrique in east\n\nMaster Pedro González commanding eastern army under Juan\n\nFull supply chain details and depot locations\n\nHe does NOT know:\n\nExact day western fleet launches (within ~week window)\n\nDetailed tactical plans for specific sieges\n\nInternal command relationships and potential weaknesses\n\nSome operational details and contingency plans\n\nGranada's Response: Fully aware of the strategic trap. Must still choose where to commit primary forces. Likely keeps forces more balanced (13,000-15,000 east, 10,000-12,000 west) to avoid being overwhelmed on either front, but this means neither front is overwhelming. Maximum mobilization. Considers trying to defeat eastern army quickly before western lands. Prepares ambushes at mountain passes. Attempts to disrupt relay system.\n\n86-95: COMPREHENSIVE INTELLIGENCE (Major Failure for Secrecy)\n\nSultan knows virtually everything about the crusade plans except the most sensitive tactical details. Has detailed maps, force compositions, command structures, supply chains, timeline, coordination systems, and strategic objectives. Likely has spies in noble households or corrupted officials providing regular reports.\n\nGranada's Response: Fully prepared for both-front war. May attempt innovative counters like preemptive naval raids against Seville fleet before it launches, ambushes against artillery columns, raids on supply depots, or trying to foment noble dissent in Castile. Still faces strategic dilemma but has maximum time to prepare response.\n\n96-100: NEAR-PERFECT INTELLIGENCE (Catastrophic Failure for Secrecy)\n\nSultan has penetrated inner circle or corrupted high-level officials. Knows everything including most sensitive tactical details, contingency plans, internal disagreements, command relationships, and operational timetables down to specific dates. May even know about Isabel's pregnancy or other personal matters affecting command decisions.\n\nGranada's Response: Can prepare optimal counterstrategy. Possible pre-emptive strikes before April launch. May try assassination attempts against key commanders. Prepares sophisticated deception operations. Could attempt diplomatic offensive to split Castilian nobles. Still must fight the war, but has every possible advantage intelligence can provide.\n\nCurrent Assessment from Chapter 14: Based on Master Pedro's report, Granada appears to be somewhere in the 26-50 range (Partial Intelligence) - they know something significant is coming but are misjudging the scale and expecting the traditional western approach.\n\nPlease roll your physical d100 and report the result. I'll then narrate exactly what Sultan Muhammad IX knows about your crusade preparations as of March 18, 1431 (one week before your armies fully assemble)."

          "text": "**Sultan knows (from 26-50 range):**\n- Major crusade launching early April 1431\n- Large eastern army (~20,000) assembling at Jaén\n- Smaller western force (~8,000-10,000) at Seville\n- Juan leading eastern army personally with banner and relics\n- Artillery present (though may not know exact number)\n- Crusader force of several hundred elite troops\n- General objective: penetrate toward Granada heartland\n\n**He does NOT know:**\n- True western force size (thinks 8-10K, actually 12K)\n- Naval component of western strategy\n- Two-army coordination system and relay network\n- Staggered deployment (western waits for eastern commitment signal)\n- 3,000 cavalry raiders as mobile screening force\n- Specific siege targets and operational plans\n\n**Granada's Resources (from project knowledge):**\n- 8,000 professional Granadan troops (well-trained)\n- 8,000 Granadan militia (poorly trained)\n- 5,000 Moroccan professional troops (arrived)\n- 1,000 Moroccan cavalry\n- 2,000-3,000 Muslim volunteers\n- **Total: 24,000-25,000 troops**\n- 20-25 war galleys (naval capability)\n- Ottoman cannon technology and gunners\n- 220,000 dinars received in support (net +140,000 after earlier spending)\n- Can sustain extended conflict\n- Strong fortifications throughout Granada\n- Mountain terrain favoring defense\n\n**Sultan Muhammad IX's character/competence:**\n- Described as \"competent, not foolish\"\n- Successfully rallied unprecedented Muslim world support\n- This is now jihad vs. crusade - religious legitimacy\n- Has experienced military advisors and engineers\n\nNow I need to create a d100 table of strategic options. \n\nI see multiple strategic pathways that leverage Granada's strengths. The options range from pure defense to aggressive counterstrikes, each with unique advantages. Defensive strategies protect core territories, while offensive approaches could disrupt Christian invasion plans. Naval and diplomatic options provide additional flexibility, allowing Muhammad IX to exploit potential weaknesses in the Castilian alliance or maritime vulnerabilities.\n\nGiven intelligence about eastern and western army compositions, I would prioritize eastern defense while maintaining strategic western reserves. The goal is preventing deep penetration of Muslim territories, using terrain and tactical positioning to maximum advantage. Potential approaches include selective raids, strategic withdrawals, and targeted counterattacks that minimize direct confrontation while maximizing strategic impact.\n\nThe strategic spectrum allows nuanced responses: from cautious fortification to bold preemptive strikes. Each approach carries distinct risks and potential rewards, requiring careful assessment of current military capabilities, alliance dynamics, and immediate territorial threats.\n\nSultan Muhammad IX's Strategic Options\n\nBased on the Sultan's intelligence (knows large eastern army ~20,000 at Jaén with Juan/banner/relics, smaller western force ~8-10K at Seville, general April launch), let me draft strategic options ranging from passive defense to maximum aggression.\n\nSultan's Available Resources:\n\n24,000-25,000 troops (8K professional Granadan, 8K militia, 5K Moroccan, 1K Moroccan cavalry, 2-3K volunteers)\n\n20-25 war galleys (naval power)\n\nOttoman cannon technology and gunners\n\n~140,000 dinars net treasury surplus\n\nStrong fortifications across Granada\n\nMountain terrain advantage\n\nJihad declaration = high morale and religious legitimacy\n\nExperienced military advisors from across Muslim world\n\nD100 Table: Sultan's Strategic Response\n\n1-8: PASSIVE FORTRESS DEFENSE (Overly Cautious)\n\nStrategy: Purely reactive, minimal risk\n\nPull ALL forces back to Granada city and immediate surroundings (20,000+)\n\nAbandon frontier fortresses except absolute minimum garrisons\n\nConcentrate everything around Granada/Alhambra\n\nWait for crusaders to exhaust themselves in sieges\n\nNo offensive operations, no raids, no naval activity\n\nHope crusaders run out of supplies/time before reaching capital\n\nStrengths: Granada city nearly impregnable, forces united\nWeaknesses: Surrenders frontier without contest, allows crusaders free movement, demoralizes frontier populations, wastes naval assets, purely defensive psychology\n\nAssessment: Overly passive for Sultan's resources and the jihad's momentum. Unlikely choice for competent commander with this much support.\n\n9-20: TRADITIONAL DEFENSIVE DEPLOYMENT (Conservative)\n\nStrategy: Standard defensive posture, garrison network\n\nMain army (14,000-16,000) positioned near Granada city\n\nStrong garrisons (500-1,000) in all major frontier fortresses\n\nWestern coast defended with 6,000-8,000 troops\n\nNaval patrols along coast (12-15 galleys)\n\nReactive response to crusader movements\n\nLimited raiding/skirmishing near frontier\n\nStrengths: Balanced coverage, maintains all positions, flexible response\nWeaknesses: Dispersed forces vulnerable to being defeated piecemeal, doesn't leverage numerical parity, allows initiative to crusaders, reactive rather than proactive\n\nAssessment: Safe but uninspired. Doesn't use the unprecedented support received or the jihad's momentum.\n\n21-35: ACTIVE DEFENSE WITH FRONTIER FOCUS (Moderately Defensive)\n\nStrategy: Strong frontier defense, prepare for long war\n\nFortify and supply all frontier castles for extended sieges (6+ months)\n\nMain army (16,000) positioned centrally to respond to breaches\n\nHeavy investment in frontier fortifications and provisions\n\nWestern garrison maintained (6,000-8,000)\n\nLimited cavalry raids against crusader supply lines\n\nNaval patrols and minor coastal harassment\n\nPrepare scorched earth policies for frontier regions if needed\n\nStrengths: Each fortress becomes expensive to besiege, time works against crusaders, supply problems multiply\nWeaknesses: Still primarily reactive, expensive to supply all fortresses, crusaders can bypass strong points\n\nAssessment: Solid defensive strategy that could drag war into attrition favorable to defenders.\n\n36-50: MOBILE DEFENSE WITH RAIDING (Balanced Defensive)\n\nStrategy: Active defense leveraging mobility and terrain\n\nMain field army (18,000) positioned to respond rapidly to eastern threat\n\nWestern defense maintained (6,000-8,000)\n\n2,000-3,000 light cavalry organized for constant raiding operations\n\nTarget crusader supply lines, depots, foraging parties\n\nHit isolated columns during mountain transit\n\nNaval harassment of coastal shipping (15-20 galleys active)\n\nAvoid pitched battles, make crusaders pay for every mile\n\nFight from prepared positions when forced to engage\n\nStrengths: Leverages Granada's mobility advantage, disrupts crusader logistics, preserves forces, uses terrain\nWeaknesses: Requires discipline to avoid pitched battle, crusaders still advance if determined, doesn't solve numerical problem\n\nAssessment: Smart strategy that plays to Granada's strengths without excessive risk.\n\n51-65: CONCENTRATION AGAINST EASTERN ARMY (Aggressive Defense)\n\nStrategy: Recognize eastern army as main threat, concentrate maximum force\n\nCommit 18,000-20,000 troops to eastern defense\n\nAccept risk in west by leaving only 5,000-6,000 defenders\n\nPrepare major ambush sites in mountain passes on eastern approach\n\nUse terrain to equalize numerical disadvantage\n\nReinforce key \"chokepoint\" fortresses that crusaders MUST take\n\nActive naval raids against western coast/shipping (trying to keep western army pinned)\n\nGoal: Defeat or maul eastern army decisively, then pivot west\n\nStrengths: Concentrates maximum force against main threat, uses terrain, potentially decisive battle\nWeaknesses: Vulnerable if western army is larger than expected, risky if eastern army too strong, puts everything on one throw\n\nAssessment: Bold strategy that could work if eastern army defeats decisively, but risky given unknown about western force.\n\n66-78: AGGRESSIVE SPOILING STRATEGY (Offensive Defense)\n\nStrategy: Disrupt crusade before it fully assembles\n\nLaunch raids against Jaén staging area in late March (before full assembly)\n\n6,000-8,000 raiders strike supply depots at Úbeda, Baeza, Ciudad Real\n\nBurn supplies, kill draft animals, destroy forward preparations\n\nNaval raids against Seville in late March (8-12 galleys)\n\nAttempt to damage ships, burn supplies, create chaos\n\nAssassins target key commanders if possible\n\nAfter raids, fall back to prepared defensive positions\n\nGoal: Delay campaign launch, reduce crusader effectiveness, damage morale\n\nStrengths: Initiative, disrupts crusader preparations, psychological impact, forces crusaders to defend rear\nWeaknesses: Raids might fail, provokes earlier response, could lose raiding forces, doesn't solve underlying numerical problem\n\nAssessment: Risky but potentially high-reward strategy that could delay or damage crusade significantly.\n\n79-88: PREEMPTIVE OFFENSIVE AGAINST EASTERN ARMY (High Risk Offensive)\n\nStrategy: Strike while eastern army still assembling (mid-late March)\n\nCommit 16,000-18,000 troops to offensive through mountain passes\n\nStrike Jaén before full 23,000 crusaders assembled (when only 8-10K present)\n\nCatch crusaders unprepared, destroy forward elements\n\nSeize or destroy supply depots\n\nIf successful, potentially forces crusade cancellation for year\n\nMaintain defensive posture in west (6,000-8,000)\n\nNaval forces protect western coast and supply lines\n\nStrengths: Could catch crusaders unprepared, numerical advantage while enemy assembling, decisive early victory possible, enormous psychological impact\nWeaknesses: Very risky leaving Granada defenseless, mountain offensive difficult, if fails leaves Granada vulnerable, crusaders could counter-attack weakened force\n\nAssessment: High-risk, high-reward strategy. Success could destroy crusade; failure could doom Granada. Requires excellent timing and execution.\n\n89-95: MAXIMUM AGGRESSION - DUAL OFFENSIVE (Extremely Risky)\n\nStrategy: All-out offensive on both fronts simultaneously\n\n12,000 troops strike east toward Jaén (late March)\n\n10,000 troops + naval assault west toward Seville (late March)\n\nGoal: Preemptively shatter crusade before it launches\n\nCatch both armies while still assembling\n\nSeize initiative completely, force crusaders into defensive\n\nAccept risk to Granada city (leave minimal garrison ~2,000)\n\nEverything on offensive success\n\nStrengths: Maximum initiative, could destroy crusade before it starts, catches enemy unprepared, shocking boldness\nWeaknesses: Extremely risky, leaves Granada nearly defenseless, both offensives must succeed or Granada loses everything, difficult coordination, crusaders might defeat forces piecemeal\n\nAssessment: Desperate gamble that could win war immediately or lose it catastrophically. Would be out of character for competent Sultan unless he has intelligence suggesting crusade is weaker than it appears.\n\n96-100: SCORCHED EARTH TOTAL WAR (Ruthless Maximum Effort)\n\nStrategy: Absolute commitment to defeating crusade at any cost\n\nEvacuate and burn all frontier settlements, farms, villages\n\nDestroy everything of value crusaders could use (food, fodder, water sources)\n\nCreate wasteland between Castile and Granada heartland\n\nConcentrate entire population and all forces in Granada city + immediate surroundings\n\n22,000+ troops defending prepared positions\n\nNaval forces (all 20-25 galleys) raid Castilian coast continuously\n\nHire corsairs and mercenaries with remaining treasury\n\nSend urgent appeals for more Muslim reinforcements (offer anything)\n\nPrepare for siege of Granada city itself - stockpile for 1-2 years\n\nAccept massive civilian suffering to make conquest impossibly expensive\n\nStrengths: Makes conquest economically and logistically impossible, removes all resources from crusaders, united defense, psychological warfare\nWeaknesses: Destroys own frontier population's livelihoods, creates internal dissent, abandons everything except capital, horrific civilian suffering, if Granada falls anyway, nothing left\n\nAssessment: Total war strategy born of desperation or absolute conviction. Would only make sense if Sultan believes crusade intends genocide rather than conquest.\n\nMy Assessment\n\nGiven:\n\nSultan's intelligence (knows eastern army is major threat with Juan/banner/relics)\n\nHis competence (successfully rallied Muslim world)\n\nResources available (24-25K troops, naval power, good treasury)\n\nThe jihad's momentum and morale\n\nMedieval military doctrine\n\nMost Likely Range: 36-65 (Mobile Defense to Concentration Against Eastern)\n\nA competent Sultan would recognize:\n\nEastern army is primary threat (Juan, banner, relics indicate main effort)\n\nWestern force seems secondary (~8-10K in his intelligence)\n\nHe has near-numerical parity with combined crusader forces\n\nMountain terrain favors defense\n\nJihad morale is high - can sustain losses better than usual\n\nTime favors defense (supply problems multiply for attackers)\n\nMy Prediction: Roll will likely fall 40-60 range - balanced defensive strategy with active raiding, concentration against eastern threat while maintaining western defense.\n\nPlease roll your physical d100 for Sultan's strategic choice. I'll then narrate his complete battle plan and dispositions as of late March 1431."

          "text": "Now Juan is assembling the 3,000 cavalry force on March 25th to start screening operations. This is the official assembly deadline.\n\nI need to narrate:\n1. The full assembly at Jaén on March 25th\n2. The 3,000 cavalry being organized and deployed\n3. The state of the full eastern army\n4. What intelligence they might gather about Granada's preparations\n5. Juan's decisions about deployment and next moves\n\nLet me search for context about the cavalry organization and the current state of affairs.\n\nThe sun rose over a transformed landscape. Where weeks ago there had been open fields and scattered camps outside Jaén's walls, now stretched a city of canvas and steel—23,000 men assembled under the banner of the cross.\n\nJuan stood atop the fortress walls at dawn, Isabel beside him, both watching the army wake. Cook fires kindled by the hundreds, creating a haze of smoke across the valley. The sounds carried up—officers shouting orders, horses neighing, the constant din of an army preparing for war.\n\n\"It's real now,\" Isabel murmured, her hand resting unconsciously on her belly. She'd been unusually tired these past few days, and her morning appetite had been... strange. But she said nothing of it yet.\n\nJuan nodded. \"God willing, by summer's end, Granada will kneel.\"\n\nBelow, the assembly was complete. The final noble contingents had arrived yesterday—the Count of Niebla with his 800 men, the Marquis of Santillana with 600 more. Pedro González's meticulous accounting confirmed it: 23,147 troops present and accounted for.\n\nThe Eastern Army - Final Composition:\n\n2,000 Crown professional troops (veterans, well-equipped)\n\n4,500 Military Order knights and men-at-arms (Calatrava 1,500, Santiago 2,000, Alcántara 1,000)\n\n18,000 noble levies (quality varied, but all properly armed)\n\n267 crusaders (from Toledo, arrived three days ago)\n\n5 bombards with crews (Pietro Calabrese commanding)\n\nSupport personnel, surgeons, chaplains\n\nThe white banner with the True Cross and Santiago's bone hung from the fortress's highest tower, visible for miles. The Guardian Company—now 80 strong after recent additions—maintained constant vigil around it.\n\nThe Cavalry Muster\n\nBy mid-morning, Juan descended to the cavalry assembly ground southeast of the main camp. Three thousand horsemen waited—the finest light cavalry from across Castile, many from frontier families who'd spent lifetimes raiding and skirmishing with Moorish forces.\n\nPedro González stood at the center with six commanders arrayed before their columns. Each commander led 500 cavalry organized into five troops of 100. The horses stamped and snorted, eager after weeks of rest and grain.\n\nThe Six Column Commanders:\n\nColumn One - Don García Fernández de Baeza\nAge 38, veteran of twenty frontier campaigns. Lean, scarred face, reputation for aggressive pursuit. Commands 500 horsemen from Jaén and Úbeda region. Knows the central approaches intimately.\n\nColumn Two - Don Rodrigo de Narváez\nAge 42, from minor nobility of Antequera frontier. Spent entire adult life in border warfare. Cautious, methodical, never loses men unnecessarily. Commands 500 from Córdoba and Écija region.\n\nColumn Three - Don Pedro Manrique de Lara\nAge 29, younger cousin of Rodrigo Manrique. Hungry to prove himself, excellent horseman. Commands 500 mixed cavalry including 100 Military Order knights from Santiago.\n\nColumn Four - Don Álvar Pérez de Guzmán\nAge 35, from Seville's frontier nobility. Speaks Arabic fluently, understands Moorish tactics deeply. Commands 500 Andalusian cavalry, many with Moorish horses.\n\nColumn Five - Don Juan de Luna (no relation to Álvaro)\nAge 33, from Murcia frontier. Specialized in deep reconnaissance, can survive weeks behind enemy lines. Commands 500 eastern frontier cavalry familiar with mountain passes.\n\nColumn Six - Don Sancho de Rojas\nAge 40, veteran commander from Calatrava Order. Solid, reliable, coordinates well with others. Commands 500 mixed cavalry including 150 Military Order knights from Calatrava and Alcántara.\n\nJuan's Orders\n\nThe king addressed them from horseback, his father's sword at his hip, wearing lighter armor suitable for a command role rather than combat. Around him stood Pedro González, Infante Enrique, and the senior commanders.\n\n\"Gentlemen, you are the eyes and shield of this army. Your mission is threefold:\n\nFirst: Reconnaissance. I need to know what lies ahead. Every fortress, every pass, every water source between here and Granada. Where the Sultan's forces are positioned. Their strength, their movements, their intentions. The main army cannot advance blind.\n\nSecond: Screening. Deny the enemy intelligence about our movements and strength. Drive off their scouts. Intercept their messengers. Make them uncertain about where we are and what we intend.\n\nThird: Disruption. Strike their supply lines, foraging parties, isolated detachments. Make them afraid to move in small groups. Force them to concentrate, which limits their flexibility.\n\nYou have complete freedom of movement. I do not dictate your routes or methods. You are professional raiders—use your judgment. But report back regularly. I need current intelligence every three days at minimum.\n\nRules of Engagement:\n\nAvoid pitched battles against superior forces. You are scouts and raiders, not the main battle line.\n\nPreserve your forces. Dead cavalry tell no tales and gather no intelligence.\n\nTreat prisoners according to the customs of war. We want defectors and informants.\n\nCivilian populations are to be left unmolested unless they actively resist. We are liberating these lands, not devastating them.\n\nAny questions?\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez spoke: \"Your Majesty, how deep do you want us ranging? There's a difference between screening the immediate frontier and raiding deep into Granada.\"\n\nJuan glanced at Pedro González, who nodded. \"Initially, stay within two days' ride of the main army. As we advance and secure fortresses, you'll range deeper. I want a flexible screen that moves with us, not raiders operating independently far from support.\"\n\nDon García Fernández de Baeza: \"And if we encounter the Sultan's cavalry forces? His Moroccan horsemen are excellent fighters.\"\n\n\"Avoid them unless you have clear advantage,\" Juan replied. \"But if forced to fight, fight smart. Use terrain. Use ambush. Remember—you win by surviving and reporting what you learned, not by dying gloriously.\"\n\nInfante Enrique added, \"I've fought Moorish cavalry. They're fast and skilled, but they prefer open ground. Use forests, rough country, anything that limits their mobility. And watch for their feigned retreats—it's a favorite tactic.\"\n\nThe commanders nodded, appreciating the practical advice.\n\nDeployment\n\nThe six columns departed over the next two hours, each taking different routes into the frontier:\n\nColumn One (García Fernández): Southeast toward Alcalá la Real, the nearest major Moorish fortress (20 miles distant). Mission: Reconnaissance of immediate approaches.\n\nColumn Two (Rodrigo de Narváez): South-southwest toward Moclín fortress (25 miles). Mission: Scout western approaches and potential flanking routes.\n\nColumn Three (Pedro Manrique): Due south toward Íllora (30 miles). Mission: Deep reconnaissance toward Granada's northern defenses.\n\nColumn Four (Álvar Pérez): Southeast toward Cambil fortress (25 miles). Mission: Scout eastern approaches and mountain passes.\n\nColumn Five (Juan de Luna): East-southeast toward Guadix region (40+ miles). Mission: Long-range reconnaissance of eastern frontier.\n\nColumn Six (Sancho de Rojas): Remains with main army as reserve and courier relay. Will rotate with other columns.\n\nJuan watched them ride out, 2,500 cavalry dispersing like a net being cast across the frontier. The remaining 500 under Don Sancho stayed as headquarters reserve and to maintain courier chains between the ranging columns.\n\nPedro González stood beside him. \"It begins, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"It begins,\" Juan agreed. \"How long until we can advance the main army?\"\n\n\"Three days, perhaps four. We need initial intelligence from the cavalry. We need Pietro's bombards positioned—they arrived yesterday but the oxen teams need rest. And we need to ensure supply trains are organized properly for the march.\"\n\n\"Then we wait for our scouts to return with news of what awaits us.\"\n\nStatus Summary\n\nDate: March 25, 1431\nLocation: Jaén Fortress\nEastern Army Strength: 23,147 troops fully assembled\nCavalry Screen: 2,500 deployed in five ranging columns, 500 in reserve\nArtillery: 5 bombards ready, crews rested\nSupply Status: Four forward depots stocked (Ciudad Real, Úbeda, Baeza, Jaén)\nTreasury: 390,000 florins available\nTime Until Main Army Advance: 3-4 days (awaiting initial intelligence)\n\nKnown Enemy Disposition (from prior intelligence):\nSultan Muhammad IX likely has 18,000-20,000 troops concentrated near Granada city and approaches, with mobile cavalry forces ranging the frontier. Western defenses maintained with 6,000-8,000. Granada using mobile defense strategy with active raiding operations.\n\nWestern Army Status:\n12,000 troops assembled at Seville under Rodrigo Manrique and Infante Juan. Awaiting signal from eastern front to launch coordinated naval operations.\n\nWhat are your orders while waiting for the cavalry to report back? The next three days will determine what you learn about Granada's dispositions and defenses before committing the main army to advance."

This means:\n- Main Granada field army (18,000) positioned to respond to eastern threat\n- Light cavalry (2,000-3,000) ranging for raids and screening\n- Frontier fortresses garrisoned but not massively reinforced\n- Active defensive posture, not passive\n\nLet me narrate the waiting period and first scout returns.\n\nUnderstood.

I'll narrate the world and NPCs, then stop for you to decide what Juan does or says.\n\n(And yes, noted—Juan appeared at the cavalry assembly in his full white armor and crusader regalia, making himself unmistakable to the troops.)\n\nMarch 25-27, 1431 - Waiting at Jaén\n\nThe army settled into the rhythms of a host awaiting orders. Drills continued. Supplies were organized and reorganized. Pietro Calabrese supervised the positioning of his five bombards at strategic points around the camp, ensuring the massive guns and their ox teams would be ready to march when the order came.\n\nThe Toledo crusaders, 267 strong, integrated into the larger Guardian Company structure. Fray Hernando conducted daily Masses before the banner, which remained mounted on the fortress tower—visible for miles, a constant reminder of the sacred purpose.\n\nIsabel spent much of her time in the fortress chapel, though she seemed unusually fatigued. Catarina hovered nearby, watchful.\n\nPedro González maintained constant coordination with the supply officers, ensuring the forward depots at Úbeda and Baeza were prepared to support the army's advance. Father Tommaso's accounting system proved its worth—every barrel of grain, every horseshoe, every bolt of canvas was tracked and positioned.\n\nMarch 27, Evening - First Scout Returns\n\nDon Sancho de Rojas, commanding the reserve cavalry, found Pedro González as dusk fell. \"Master, rider from Don García's column just arrived. He requests audience with His Majesty.\"\n\nThe messenger was a young knight, his horse lathered from hard riding. Dust covered his face, and his armor showed signs of hasty travel through rough country.\n\nPedro summoned you to the command chamber where maps of the frontier were spread across tables. Infante Enrique was already present, having been reviewing defensive positions.\n\nThe young knight—Diego de Córdoba—stood at attention. Pedro nodded for him to report.\n\n\"Your Majesty, Commander Don García sends his compliments. My column reached the approaches to Alcalá la Real. The fortress is garrisoned—we estimate 800-1,000 men based on activity observed. They're alert but not expecting immediate attack. Their cavalry patrols extend perhaps five miles from the walls, but we evaded them easily.\"\n\nDiego paused, catching his breath. \"More importantly, Your Majesty—we encountered Moorish cavalry, approximately 300 riders, ranging northwest from the fortress. They're screening their own territory, looking for us just as we're looking for them. We shadowed them for half a day. They're good, well-mounted, disciplined. Moroccan professionals, we think, not local militia.\"\n\nHe gestured to the map. \"Don García believes there are likely 2,000-3,000 cavalry total operating across the frontier in mobile columns, similar to our own deployment. They're not concentrated—they're spread out, probing and screening. He requests permission to continue reconnaissance deeper toward Alcalá la Real's southern approaches.\"\n\nPedro looked at the map thoughtfully. \"Granada's using mobile cavalry just as we are. Smart.\"\n\nInfante Enrique added, \"Those Moroccan horsemen are dangerous. If our columns encounter them in equal numbers, it'll be a real fight.\"\n\nThe messenger continued, \"One more thing, Your Majesty. We captured a local farmer near Alcalá who'd been pressed into service providing supplies to the fortress. He says the garrison has been reinforced in the last month—additional troops, supplies stockpiled for long siege. The Sultan's preparing for us.\"\n\nMarch 28, Afternoon - More Reports\n\nOver the next day, riders returned from three more columns:\n\nFrom Don Rodrigo de Narváez (Column Two - Moclín):\n\"Moclín fortress strongly garrisoned, perhaps 700-800 men. Limited cavalry patrols. Fortress sits on high ground, approaches difficult. No signs of major field army in this sector. Local villages appear normal—no evacuation, no scorched earth. Requests permission to probe further west.\"\n\nFrom Don Álvar Pérez de Guzmán (Column Four - Cambil):\n\"Cambil fortress garrisoned with 500-600 men. Observed Moorish cavalry patrol of approximately 200 riders. They spotted us and withdrew quickly—didn't seek engagement. Mountain passes south of Cambil appear lightly defended. Significant intelligence: spoke with a Mudéjar merchant (under safe conduct) who reports Sultan's main army—estimated 16,000-18,000 troops—positioned roughly 40 miles south, between Loja and Granada city itself. They're centrally positioned to respond to threats from any direction. Merchant seemed reliable—his information matches what we've observed.\"\n\nFrom Don Pedro Manrique (Column Three - Íllora):\n\"Íllora fortress heavily garrisoned—at least 1,000 men. Strong defensive position. Encountered Moorish cavalry force of 400-500 riders. Brief skirmish—we withdrew after confirming their strength. Lost two men wounded, killed three of theirs. They didn't pursue aggressively. Believe this is part of larger screening force. Terrain south of Íllora is rough—advantage to defenders.\"\n\nMarch 29, Morning - The Clearest Picture\n\nDon Juan de Luna's column, which had ranged farthest east toward Guadix, returned with the most detailed intelligence.\n\nThe commander himself presented his report, spreading his own hand-drawn maps on the table. Luna was weathered, competent, and clearly exhausted from days of constant riding.\n\n\"Your Majesty, Master Pedro, my lords—here's what we found:\n\nThe eastern frontier is less heavily defended than the central approaches. Guadix has perhaps 600 troops. The mountain passes east of Granada are garrisoned but not heavily—they're betting we'll come through the center, not the flanks.\n\nMost significantly: we ranging far enough south to observe the Sultan's main encampment. It's positioned here\"—he pointed to a spot between Loja and Granada—\"roughly equidistant from the central and western approaches. Best estimate: 17,000-18,000 troops. They have a substantial cavalry screen, perhaps 2,500-3,000 horsemen ranging across the entire frontier. Their camp is organized, well-supplied. They're not panicking—they're waiting to see where we commit.\n\nThe Sultan's playing it smart. He's positioned centrally so he can march to reinforce wherever we strike. If we besiege Alcalá la Real, he can reach it in two days. If we push toward Moclín, same thing. He's not committing until we do.\"\n\nPedro González studied the maps intently. \"So he knows we're here. He knows we're strong. But he doesn't know our exact strength or our objective yet. He's waiting to see where we push, then he'll respond with his main army.\"\n\nLuna nodded. \"That's my assessment, Master. And there's one more thing—the fortresses are all supplied for extended sieges. Months, not weeks. They're dug in and waiting.\"\n\nCurrent Intelligence Summary:\n\nGranada's Dispositions:\n\nMain field army: 17,000-18,000 troops positioned centrally (40 miles south, between Loja and Granada city)\n\nScreening cavalry: 2,500-3,000 riders in mobile columns across frontier\n\nFrontier fortresses all garrisoned and supplied:\nAlcalá la Real: 800-1,000 men\n\nMoclín: 700-800 men\n\nÍllora: 1,000 men\n\nCambil: 500-600 men\n\nGuadix: 600 men\n\n(Various smaller forts with 100-300 each)\n\nGranada's Strategy: Mobile defense. Sultan waits centrally, ready to march wherever the crusade commits. Using cavalry to screen and raid while main army stays flexible.\n\nTerrain Assessment: Central approaches (Alcalá, Moclín, Íllora) are the most direct routes toward Granada but heavily defended. Eastern approaches less defended but through difficult mountains. Western approaches uncertain (not scouted by eastern cavalry).\n\nThe commanders wait for your assessment and orders. The army is assembled, supplied, and ready. The question is: where do you strike first?"

          "text": "Juan's questions are:\n1. Central or eastern approaches?\n2. If we go through center and Sultan deploys against us, what happens?\n\nI should have these experienced commanders debate the options realistically, considering:\n- Granada's mobile defense strategy\n- The 23,000 vs 17-18,000 troop numbers\n- Terrain advantages/disadvantages\n- Siege warfare realities\n- Supply lines\n- The western army coordination\n\nLet me draft realistic military debate from professionals.\n\nWar Council - March 29, Evening, Jaén\n\nThe command chamber filled with the army's leadership. Pedro González stood near the maps, Infante Enrique beside him. The six cavalry commanders arrayed themselves around the table—García Fernández, Rodrigo de Narváez, Álvar Pérez, Pedro Manrique, Juan de Luna, and Sancho de Rojas. Captain Fernán represented the crusaders. Pietro Calabrese stood somewhat apart, the Italian master gunner uncomfortable in councils of war. Fray Hernando observed from near the window, saying nothing yet.\n\nPedro González spoke first. \"Your Majesty asks the essential question. The Sultan waits centrally. Wherever we strike, he can respond. So let's examine both options honestly.\"\n\nDon García Fernández de Baeza (veteran frontier fighter, aggressive):\n\n\"The central approach is the most direct. Alcalá la Real is twenty miles from here. Take it, and we have a forward base. From there, it's perhaps another thirty miles to Loja, then thirty more to Granada itself. Straight shot, relatively speaking. The terrain is difficult but not impossible for an army our size.\"\n\nHe paused. \"But Your Majesty asks what happens when the Sultan deploys against us. Here's the reality: if we besiege Alcalá la Real, he'll march his 18,000 troops north within days. We'll face them in the field while simultaneously conducting a siege. That means dividing our forces—part besieging the fortress, part facing his field army.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez (cautious, methodical):\n\n\"And that's dangerous, Your Majesty. Sieges consume men like a mill grinds grain. If we commit 8,000 troops to surround and assault Alcalá la Real, we have 15,000 to face the Sultan's field army. That's still advantage to us numerically, but not overwhelming. And we'd be fighting with a fortress at our backs and a hostile army in front—caught between hammer and anvil.\"\n\nInfante Enrique (tactical experience):\n\n\"I've seen this before in Italian campaigns. The besieging force always suffers when a relief army arrives. You're static, committed to siege lines, supplies are dispersed. The relief force chooses when and where to strike. Even with superior numbers, the advantage shifts to the defender.\"\n\nHe gestured to the map. \"If we push through the center and the Sultan responds with his main army, we'll get our decisive battle—but on terms that favor him somewhat. He'll force us to either lift the siege or fight divided.\"\n\nDon Juan de Luna (deep reconnaissance specialist):\n\n\"The eastern approach offers different problems and opportunities. The mountain passes are lightly defended. Guadix has only 600 men—we could take it more easily than Alcalá. The terrain is harder, rougher, but that works both ways. It's harder for the Sultan to bring his entire army through those mountains quickly.\"\n\nDon Pedro Manrique (younger, eager to prove himself):\n\n\"But the eastern route is slower, Your Majesty. Forty to fifty miles through mountains just to reach Guadix, then we'd still be nearly a hundred miles from Granada city. We'd spend weeks securing mountain fortresses before we even threaten the heartland. The Sultan would have time to reposition, fortify, prepare.\"\n\nPietro Calabrese (artillery master, speaking with heavy Italian accent):\n\n\"Your Majesty, I must speak of the bombards. Through mountains—very difficult. The roads, they are not good. Each gun needs eight oxen minimum, maybe ten for mountains. We go slow, maybe five miles per day through rough country. And if we must set up for siege in mountains... the positioning, very difficult. Mountains favor defender always.\"\n\nHe gestured emphatically. \"Through center, roads better. I can move guns faster, position them properly. Against Alcalá la Real, I can place bombards on good ground, pound walls effectively. In mountains... \" He shrugged expressively.\n\nDon Álvar Pérez de Guzmán (Arabic speaker, understands Moorish tactics):\n\n\"The Sultan is executing classic mobile defense, Your Majesty. He waits for us to commit, then responds. Whichever route we choose, he'll march to meet us. The question isn't whether we'll face him—it's where and under what conditions.\"\n\nHe leaned over the map. \"If we go through the center, we face him soon, probably within two weeks. Large battle, high stakes, fortress sieges with relief armies. If we go east, we avoid him initially, take weaker fortresses, but he has time to concentrate wherever we emerge from the mountains. Eventually, we still face him—just later and perhaps on ground more of his choosing.\"\n\nPedro González de Padilla (overall commander, thoughtful):\n\n\"Your Majesty, here's my assessment: We have 23,000 troops to their 17-18,000. That's significant advantage, but not crushing. If we meet them in open battle on reasonable ground, we should win. Our numbers, our equipment, our morale—all favor us.\n\nBut the danger is not the field battle itself. The danger is fighting that battle while simultaneously conducting siege operations. That divides our attention, our supplies, our command structure. We're doing two things at once while the Sultan does one thing with full focus.\n\nThe central route gives us the most direct path to Granada, but it guarantees early confrontation with their main army. The eastern route delays that confrontation but commits us to difficult mountain warfare where our numerical advantage matters less and our artillery is hampered.\"\n\nHe paused, measuring his words carefully. \"There's a third consideration, Your Majesty. The western army. If we push through the center and draw the Sultan's full attention, that creates the perfect conditions for Rodrigo Manrique's naval assault. The Sultan commits everything to stopping us, his western coast becomes vulnerable.\"\n\nDon Sancho de Rojas (Calatrava Order, solid veteran):\n\n\"But if we go east, Your Majesty, the Sultan might not commit fully. He might keep forces in reserve, maintain flexibility. That makes the western coordination less effective. The two-army strategy works best if we force him to make a hard choice—and the central thrust with the banner and yourself personally leading forces that choice most clearly.\"\n\nFray Hernando finally spoke from the window, his voice quiet but carrying:\n\n\"Your Majesty asked what happens if we go through the center and the Sultan deploys against us. You'll face the largest battle the frontier has seen in a generation. Many will die. The crusaders will be tested in blood. You'll carry the True Cross and Santiago's bones into combat against the armies of Islam—exactly as the Pope blessed you to do.\n\nIs that not why we came? Not to spend months taking mountain fortresses, but to break Granada's power in decisive combat? The banner was not blessed for sieges. It was blessed for battle.\"\n\nThe chamber fell quiet. Every man present understood the weight of the choice.\n\nDon García Fernández added one more thought: \"Your Majesty, whatever we choose, we must choose soon. Every day we wait here, Granada solidifies defenses and our surprise diminishes. The cavalry screening is effective, but they know we're here. They know we're strong. Soon they'll know exactly how strong.\"\n\nThe commanders waited for your decision."

          "text": "Don Rodrigo de Narváez (twenty years frontier experience) responded first:\n\n\"Their infantry is mixed quality, Your Majesty. The professional Granadan troops—perhaps 8,000 of them—are well-trained, well-equipped. They wear mail or scale armor, carry good steel weapons, fight in disciplined formations. Many use crossbows effectively. These men are dangerous—veterans who've held the frontier for years. They'll stand and fight.\"\n\nDon Álvar Pérez de Guzmán (who speaks Arabic and knows Moorish tactics intimately) elaborated:\n\n\"The Moroccan reinforcements—those 5,000 troops—are also professionals, Your Majesty. North African infantry, many of them. They favor spears and shields, fight in tight formations, very disciplined. They're religiously motivated, fighting for jihad. They won't break easily.\n\nBut the militia—those 8,000 or so—are another matter entirely. Farmers and townsmen pressed into service. Leather armor at best, often just padded cloth. Spears, maybe swords, poor shields. Minimal training. They'll man walls adequately during sieges, but in open battle?\" He shook his head. \"They'll fold if pressed hard. The Sultan knows this—he'll use them for garrison duty and keep his professionals for field combat.\"\n\nInfante Enrique added his perspective:\n\n\"I've fought Moorish infantry at Antequera years ago. Their professionals are competent but not exceptional. They lack the heavy infantry tradition—no true pike formations, no deep ranks of armored footmen like we field. They rely heavily on missile troops—crossbows, javelins, some archery. In close combat, man-to-man, our heavy infantry has the advantage.\"\n\nDon Juan de Luna provided specific tactical assessment:\n\n\"Their infantry doctrine emphasizes defensive fighting, Your Majesty. They're excellent at holding fortifications—disciplined, patient, good at using walls and terrain. But in open field battle, they're vulnerable. They lack the weight and momentum of Castilian heavy infantry. Our men-at-arms, properly led, will push through their lines.\n\nThe danger is their combined arms. They use infantry and cavalry together effectively—infantry holds position while cavalry strikes flanks and rear. That's where they're most dangerous. But pure infantry against infantry? We have the advantage in equipment, training, and fighting style.\"\n\nDon García Fernández concluded bluntly:\n\n\"Your Majesty, if we meet their field army in open battle, their cavalry is the real threat—those Moroccan horsemen especially. Their infantry will fight, the professionals will die hard, but they can't stop 23,000 Castilian troops if we commit properly. The battle will be won or lost based on cavalry actions and whether we can maintain formation under their mobile attacks.\"\n\nPedro González summarized:\n\n\"In short, Your Majesty: their infantry is adequate for defense, dangerous behind walls, but inferior to ours in open battle. Which means if we force a field engagement through the central approach, we should prevail—assuming we don't let their cavalry disrupt our formations or catch us divided during siege operations.\"\n\nThe commanders waited to see how this information affected your strategic thinking."

          "text": "Juan is asking a smart tactical question - if the Moors excel at mobile warfare with combined infantry/cavalry tactics, and if besieging a fortress forces the crusaders to divide their forces, does forcing the Sultan to attack the crusader army while it's besieging actually favor the crusaders? Or does it play into Moorish strengths?\n\nThis is exactly the kind of strategic dilemma that should be debated. Let me have the commanders respond thoughtfully to this question.\n\nPedro González paused, clearly impressed by the question. He exchanged glances with several of the veteran commanders.\n\n\"Your Majesty cuts to the heart of the matter. You're right to question this.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez (the cautious, methodical one) spoke carefully:\n\n\"If we besiege a fortress and the Sultan marches to relieve it, yes—we force him to come to us. But Your Majesty is correct to ask whether that actually favors us. Let me be honest: a relieving army attacking prepared positions usually has the advantage of choosing when and where to strike. We're static, committed to siege lines. He can probe, maneuver, strike at weak points.\"\n\nInfante Enrique nodded grimly:\n\n\"And their cavalry excels at exactly that kind of warfare—mobile strikes, flanking attacks, disrupting supply lines while avoiding direct engagement. If we're spread around a fortress conducting a siege, we're vulnerable to being struck piecemeal. They could raid our supply trains, hit isolated detachments, force us to either abandon the siege or fight at disadvantage.\"\n\nDon Álvar Pérez de Guzmán elaborated on Moorish tactical doctrine:\n\n\"Your Majesty understands correctly. The Moors don't want to smash themselves against prepared heavy infantry. They want mobility, flexibility—cavalry sweeping around flanks while infantry holds key positions. If we're locked into siege lines, we've surrendered mobility. That plays to their strengths, not ours.\"\n\nDon García Fernández (the aggressive one) interjected:\n\n\"But there's another side to this, Your Majesty. If the Sultan comes to relieve a fortress, he must engage us eventually. He can't just dance around forever—the fortress garrison needs relief, needs supplies, needs rescue. At some point he has to commit to battle. And when he does commit, our superior numbers and heavy infantry should prevail.\"\n\nDon Juan de Luna shook his head:\n\n\"Only if we can force him into the kind of battle that favors us, García. But if we're divided between siege operations and facing his field army, he chooses the terms. He might strike our siege lines when we're unprepared. He might ignore the fortress entirely and march past us to raid deeper into our supply lines. He might engage just enough to disrupt the siege, then withdraw before we can bring our full strength to bear.\"\n\nDon Sancho de Rojas (Calatrava veteran) added a historical perspective:\n\n\"I've seen this before, Your Majesty. At Antequera in '410, we besieged the fortress with 12,000 men. The Moors brought a relief army. For weeks they harassed us—raids, skirmishes, cutting supply lines. Never gave us the decisive battle we wanted. Eventually we took the fortress, but it cost us months and hundreds of men to harassment.\"\n\nPedro González synthesized the discussion:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the honest answer is this: forcing them to attack us while we besiege sounds advantageous in theory—we're prepared, they must come to us. But in practice, their tactical flexibility and cavalry superiority means they can choose how to attack, when to attack, and whether to fully commit. We end up reactive, responding to their moves while also conducting a siege.\n\nThe real question is whether we want a siege-with-relief-battle scenario at all, or whether we want to force a decisive field engagement on more open terms.\"\n\nDon Álvar Pérez posed the alternative:\n\n\"What if we don't besiege immediately, Your Majesty? What if we advance toward a fortress—say Alcalá la Real—make clear we intend to take it, but don't commit to full siege lines? Keep the army concentrated and mobile. Force the Sultan to either defend the fortress with his field army or abandon it. That way we're not divided, we maintain flexibility, and if battle comes, it's on more equal terms.\"\n\nInfante Enrique considered this:\n\n\"A demonstration in force rather than immediate siege. Show we can take the fortress, force him to respond, but don't lock ourselves into static positions until we've dealt with his field army. That changes the dynamic considerably.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez warned:\n\n\"But that requires patience and discipline, Your Majesty. The nobles will want to storm fortresses, take prizes, show results. Maneuvering without immediate siege might frustrate them. And the longer we maneuver without taking fortresses, the more time Granada has to prepare and reinforce.\"\n\nPietro Calabrese the artillery master spoke up:\n\n\"Your Majesty, if you do not besiege immediately, my bombards—what do they do? We march them close to fortress, set them up, pound walls... this takes days. If we then march away without siege, we waste time and effort. The guns, they want to shoot, not march back and forth.\"\n\nThe commanders looked at each other, then back to you. The strategic dilemma was clear:\n\nFull siege divides forces and plays to Moorish tactical strengths\n\nDemonstration without siege maintains flexibility but sacrifices immediate gains\n\nThe Sultan's mobile defense strategy is designed precisely to create this dilemma\n\nThey waited to hear your thinking on how to resolve it."

          "text": "Pietro Calabrese (the artillery expert) should speak first and most authoritatively on this. Then the veteran commanders can discuss the tactical implications.\n\nPietro Calabrese stepped forward immediately, his eyes lighting up. The Italian gunner had been waiting for someone to ask about his bombards properly.\n\n\"Your Majesty, yes! Absolutely yes. The bombards, they do not need full encirclement. In fact, better without it!\"\n\nHe moved to the map excitedly, gesturing as he spoke:\n\n\"A proper siege with bombards—we choose one section of wall, maybe two if fortress is large. We position the guns here, here\"—he pointed—\"perhaps 300 yards from walls. Close enough to be accurate, far enough to be safe from their arrows and crossbows. We pound the same section of wall again and again. Ten shots per gun per day if we are careful. Fifty shots total across five guns. In a week, maybe ten days—breach.\"\n\nDon García Fernández grasped the implication immediately:\n\n\"So we don't need siege lines around the entire fortress. We just need to control the ground where the bombards sit and prevent sallies from the gates. The rest of the army stays concentrated, mobile, ready to face the Sultan's field army if it comes.\"\n\nPedro González studied the concept:\n\n\"Your Majesty's thinking is sound. We position the bombards on one side of the fortress—whichever side offers best ground and firing positions. We deploy perhaps 5,000 troops to guard the guns and prevent sallies. The remaining 18,000 stay concentrated in fighting formation, ready for field battle. When the Sultan arrives with his relief army, we're not scattered around the fortress—we're concentrated and ready to meet him.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez considered the tactical details:\n\n\"The garrison can't sally effectively against 5,000 troops, especially with the main army nearby. And they can't stop the bombardment—no fortress has counter-battery capability against our guns. They'd have to just sit inside and endure while we pound their walls. Meanwhile, if the Sultan's field army approaches, we're not caught divided. We're ready for battle.\"\n\nInfante Enrique nodded approvingly:\n\n\"This is much better. We maintain offensive pressure on the fortress without surrendering mobility. And critically, Your Majesty—we're not trying to starve them out, which takes months. We're battering down walls with gunpowder, which takes days. Speed is everything.\"\n\nPietro Calabrese continued enthusiastically:\n\n\"And Your Majesty, once we make breach—maybe after eight, ten days of bombardment—then we can assault. We don't need to surround fortress to assault a breach. We concentrate troops at the breach point, storm through with overwhelming numbers. The rest of fortress doesn't matter if we break through in one place.\"\n\nDon Álvar Pérez de Guzmán raised a practical consideration:\n\n\"The garrison will try to repair the breach at night, Your Majesty. They'll pile rubble, build makeshift walls behind the breach. But with five bombards concentrating fire, we can break wall faster than they can repair it. And when we do assault through the breach, 5,000 troops is more than enough—probably overkill for most of these fortresses.\"\n\nDon Juan de Luna saw the larger strategic picture:\n\n\"So we advance to Alcalá la Real with the entire army concentrated. We position the bombards, assign 5,000 men to guard them and conduct the bombardment. The remaining 18,000—the vast bulk of our strength—stays in fighting formation two or three miles behind the bombardment position. If the Sultan's army appears, we're ready. If not, we breach the walls in ten days and storm through with overwhelming force.\"\n\nDon Sancho de Rojas added:\n\n\"And once we take the fortress, we garrison it with perhaps 500 men and move on to the next one. The army never divides, never becomes vulnerable to being struck piecemeal. We're always concentrated, always ready for field battle.\"\n\nPedro González summarized the tactical concept:\n\n\"Your Majesty has identified the solution. We use the bombards to break fortresses quickly without traditional encirclement. This keeps the army concentrated and mobile—ready to fight the Sultan's field army on favorable terms whenever he commits. We get the benefits of siege warfare—taking fortresses, securing our advance—without the vulnerability of divided forces.\"\n\nHe paused. \"There's one risk: the Sultan might attack the bombardment position itself with his cavalry, try to capture or destroy the guns. But with 5,000 troops guarding them and the main army close enough to respond within hours, that's a manageable risk. And if he does attack the guns, he's committing to battle on ground we've chosen.\"\n\nDon García Fernández grinned:\n\n\"Your Majesty, this changes everything. I thought we'd be locked into months of traditional siege warfare. But if we can breach walls in ten days while keeping the army concentrated... we could take three or four fortresses in a campaign season. Drive deep into Granada's heartland.\"\n\nThe commanders looked at each other with growing confidence. The tactical problem that had seemed so intractable—how to conduct sieges without becoming vulnerable—suddenly had a solution.\n\nThey waited to see if you had more questions about implementing this approach, or if you were ready to make your strategic decision about which route to take."

          "text": "The commanders would likely be enthusiastic about this - it solves multiple problems:\n- Protects bombards from sorties\n- Creates defensive position against Sultan's relief army\n- Shows strategic sophistication\n- But requires time and labor\n\nLet me have different commanders respond with different perspectives.\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez immediately straightened, clearly familiar with the reference:\n\n\"Your Majesty refers to the Roman siege works—circumvallation facing the fortress, contravallation facing outward against relief armies. Caesar's campaigns in Gaul. Yes, this is precisely what we need.\"\n\nInfante Enrique (well-educated, studied military history) added with evident respect:\n\n\"At Alesia, not Gergovia—Gergovia was actually Caesar's defeat, Your Majesty. But at Alesia he built double walls: inner walls trapping the Gauls in their fortress, outer walls protecting his army from the massive Gallic relief force. He fought on two fronts simultaneously and won decisively because his fieldworks protected him.\"\n\nPedro González grasped the concept immediately:\n\n\"Your Majesty proposes we build defensive works around the bombardment position. Not full encirclement of the fortress—we've established we don't need that. But earthworks, palisades, ditches protecting the bombards and the 5,000 troops manning them. And perhaps outer works facing the direction the Sultan's army would approach from.\"\n\nDon García Fernández considered the practicalities:\n\n\"It would take time, Your Majesty. Digging ditches, raising earthen ramparts, building palisades—even with 5,000 men working, we're talking three or four days minimum for basic works. A week for something substantial.\"\n\nDon Álvar Pérez de Guzmán saw the tactical advantages:\n\n\"But those three or four days would be worth it, Your Majesty. Fieldworks would protect the bombards from cavalry raids—the Moors can't just sweep in and try to capture the guns if they're behind ditches and ramparts. And the 5,000 troops defending the bombardment position would be far more effective behind prepared defenses.\"\n\nDon Juan de Luna added:\n\n\"And if the Sultan's relief army arrives while we're conducting the bombardment, we're not caught exposed. We have prepared defensive positions. He'd have to assault our fieldworks to stop the bombardment—and assaulting prepared positions is costly, even for Moorish cavalry.\"\n\nDon Sancho de Rojas raised a concern:\n\n\"But Your Majesty, if we spend days building fieldworks at each fortress, that slows our advance considerably. Take Alcalá la Real: three days to build works, ten days to breach the walls, perhaps two days to storm and secure the fortress. That's more than two weeks per fortress. At that pace, taking three or four fortresses consumes the entire campaign season.\"\n\nPietro Calabrese strongly supported the idea:\n\n\"Your Majesty, for my bombards—yes, please, fieldworks! The guns, they are valuable, expensive. If Moorish cavalry attacks, very dangerous. But behind earthworks and palisades? Much safer. And my crews can work better, not worrying about sudden attack. We shoot more accurately, more confidently.\"\n\nInfante Enrique provided historical context:\n\n\"The Romans had entire legions trained in engineering, Your Majesty. Every legionary carried an entrenching tool and knew how to build camps and siegeworks. Our troops... less so. Most are feudal levies who've never built military fieldworks. It will be slower, less professional. But the principles are sound.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez proposed a compromise:\n\n\"What if we build fieldworks selectively, Your Majesty? At the first fortress—Alcalá la Real, likely—we build substantial works. This protects our bombardment position and provides a defensive base if the Sultan's full army responds. It also teaches our troops how to build fieldworks properly. Then at subsequent fortresses, we can build faster as the men learn, or skip fieldworks entirely if the Sultan's army is defeated or distant.\"\n\nPedro González refined this thinking:\n\n\"The first fortress is when we're most vulnerable, Your Majesty. The Sultan doesn't know exactly where we'll strike, but once we commit to Alcalá la Real, he'll march his 18,000 troops to relieve it. That's when we most need defensive preparations. If we defeat his field army there—behind prepared fieldworks, with concentrated forces—the subsequent fortresses become much easier. They'll know their relief army was destroyed.\"\n\nDon García Fernández warmed to the idea:\n\n\"So we take time to do it right at Alcalá la Real. Build proper Roman-style works—ditches, ramparts, palisades. Position the bombards safely. When the Sultan comes, we're ready. We fight from prepared positions with concentrated forces. If we win that battle decisively... Your Majesty, that could break Granada's field army and open the entire frontier.\"\n\nDon Álvar Pérez de Guzmán cautioned:\n\n\"It commits us fully to that location, Your Majesty. Once we build substantial fieldworks, we're not mobile anymore. We're betting everything that we can breach Alcalá la Real's walls and defeat the Sultan's relief army in one place. If things go wrong—if the bombardment takes longer than expected, if the Sultan finds a way around our positions—we're locked in.\"\n\nDon Juan de Luna countered:\n\n\"But isn't that exactly what we want? To force a decisive engagement? The Sultan is using mobile defense, staying flexible, making us uncertain. If we build Roman siege works at Alcalá la Real, we're declaring: 'Here is where we stand. Come and fight us.' That removes all ambiguity. He must respond or lose the fortress.\"\n\nPedro González looked at you with evident respect:\n\n\"Your Majesty, this is sophisticated siege craft. Most commanders would simply surround a fortress and starve it out, or assault the walls recklessly. You're proposing something more elegant: concentrated bombardment protected by fieldworks, maintaining army cohesion, forcing the enemy to come to us on prepared ground. It's Roman doctrine adapted to gunpowder warfare.\"\n\nHe paused. \"The question is: do we have the time and the patience to build proper works? It will slow us initially. But it might win us the decisive battle that breaks Granada's power.\"\n\nFray Hernando spoke quietly from his position near the window:\n\n\"Caesar built his works at Alesia because he understood that patience in preparation leads to decisiveness in battle. He was willing to spend weeks building fortifications because he knew that when the battle came, those fortifications would mean victory. Your Majesty, if we are to carry the True Cross and Santiago's bones into battle against the armies of Islam, should we not prepare the ground properly?\"\n\nThe commanders waited for your decision on whether to incorporate extensive fieldworks into the siege plan, and where you intended to strike first."

When deployed against us, they cannot simply retreat without risking rout?\n\nThese are good tactical questions about pinning down an enemy that prefers mobile warfare. The commanders should respond with their expertise.\n\nPedro González listened intently, then nodded with growing approval:\n\n\"Your Majesty understands the challenge perfectly. The Sultan wants to avoid decisive battle—his mobile defense relies on flexibility. The question is how to force him to commit fully, then prevent withdrawal.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez addressed the logistics first:\n\n\"Hiring local carpenters and woodcutters is wise, Your Majesty. There are villages throughout this region—we can pay them well for labor and timber. We should send agents ahead immediately to the areas around Alcalá la Real to arrange this. As for wood supply, the hills south of here have adequate timber, but bringing cartloads with us provides insurance and speeds construction.\"\n\nDon Juan de Luna added:\n\n\"I can send scouts to survey timber availability around Alcalá la Real before we march. We'll know exactly what's available locally. The area isn't heavily forested, but there are enough trees for palisade stakes and construction. With hired woodcutters working alongside troops, we can gather timber quickly.\"\n\nInfante Enrique addressed the tactical questions:\n\n\"Your Majesty is correct—their infantry is significantly slower than cavalry. Once Moorish infantry deploys into battle formation, they're committed. They can't simply turn and march away without disorder. That's universal military reality. Infantry in formation is powerful but ponderous. Breaking formation to retreat invites disaster.\"\n\nDon Álvar Pérez de Guzmán elaborated on Moorish tactical doctrine:\n\n\"The Sultan will approach with his entire army—perhaps 17,000 troops. Roughly 10,000 infantry, maybe 7,000 cavalry. His infantry includes those 8,000 professionals and 5,000 Moroccans who won't break easily. Once he deploys that infantry into battle lines facing us, they're planted. They can't retreat without exposing themselves to pursuit and slaughter.\"\n\nDon García Fernández saw the strategic opportunity:\n\n\"So Your Majesty's concept is this: We fortify the bombardment position at Alcalá la Real. The Sultan marches his army to relieve the fortress. He must deploy to either assault our fieldworks or position to defend the fortress. Either way, his infantry commits to the ground. That's when our 18,000—held in reserve, fresh, mobile—strikes decisively.\"\n\nDon Sancho de Rojas considered the timing:\n\n\"The critical moment is when he deploys from march column into battle formation, Your Majesty. That's when an army is most vulnerable—half-formed, spread out, commanders still positioning units. If our cavalry screen can conceal our main force's position and we time the strike properly...\"\n\nPedro González developed the tactical concept:\n\n\"Here's how it could work, Your Majesty: The Sultan receives word we're besieging Alcalá la Real. He marches north with his 17,000 troops—two or three days' march from his current position. As he approaches, he sees our fieldworks, our bombardment position, perhaps 5,000 troops visible.\n\nHe must decide: assault our prepared positions, or deploy defensively to protect the fortress and wait for us to attack him. Either choice requires deploying his infantry from march column into battle lines.\n\nMeanwhile, our 18,000—held two or three miles back, concealed by terrain and cavalry screens—waits. When his infantry is committed, deployed, locked in position... we advance in force. His cavalry sees us coming, tries to warn him, but it's too late. Seventeen thousand infantry can't simply pick up and leave once they're in battle formation.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez cautioned:\n\n\"The concealment is the tricky part, Your Majesty. Hiding 18,000 troops from Moorish cavalry scouts is nearly impossible. They'll know we have more forces than just the 5,000 at the bombardment position.\"\n\nDon Juan de Luna proposed a solution:\n\n\"They'll know we have reserves, yes. But they won't know exactly where or how many. Our cavalry screen can create uncertainty. We keep the 18,000 in camps several miles north of the bombardment position, behind hills or in valleys. We control all the high ground. Their scouts see some camps, but can't get close enough for accurate counts. They report: 'Large reserves, uncertain numbers, positioned north of siege works.'\"\n\nDon Álvar Pérez de Guzmán explained the Sultan's dilemma:\n\n\"He faces an impossible choice, Your Majesty. If he deploys too aggressively toward our bombardment position, our 18,000 could hit his flanks or rear. If he deploys too conservatively far from the fortress, we continue battering the walls unopposed. He must position close enough to threaten our siege works but not so close he's vulnerable to being overwhelmed.\n\nThe key insight Your Majesty has identified: whatever he chooses, once his infantry deploys into battle formation, they're committed for hours. Moving 10,000 infantry safely requires careful, slow maneuvering. That's our window.\"\n\nInfante Enrique refined the strike concept:\n\n\"When we advance with the 18,000, Your Majesty, we come in good order—columns that can quickly deploy into battle lines. We have numerical superiority, fresh troops, and initiative. He's been marching for days, his troops are tired from the march and from deploying. We choose when and where to strike his line.\n\nHis cavalry will try to disrupt us, hit our flanks, slow our advance. That's where our own cavalry becomes critical—our 3,000 must screen our advance and tie down his 7,000 long enough for our infantry to close and engage.\"\n\nDon García Fernández grinned:\n\n\"And once our heavy infantry crashes into his lines with superior numbers—17,000 or 18,000 against his 10,000 infantry because his cavalry is busy elsewhere—the weight tells. Our men-at-arms push through. His lines crack. His militia breaks first, then even the professionals start to waver. That's when it cascades into rout.\"\n\nDon Sancho de Rojas added the critical detail:\n\n\"But Your Majesty, we must be patient. We can't strike too early when he's still forming up—that gives him time to withdraw in some order. And we can't wait so long he fortifies his own positions. The perfect moment is when his infantry is fully deployed in battle lines, committed to their positions, his attention focused on our siege works... then we appear in overwhelming force from an unexpected direction.\"\n\nPietro Calabrese offered an unexpected tactical advantage:\n\n\"Your Majesty, if I may—the bombards. While Sultan's army approaches, we continue bombardment. Very loud, much smoke, dramatic. His attention focuses on the fortress, on stopping the guns from breaching walls. Meanwhile, your 18,000 maneuvers into position. The noise of bombardment might even mask sounds of army movement.\"\n\nPedro González synthesized the entire plan:\n\n\"Your Majesty has designed a sophisticated double envelopment of sorts—not of space, but of attention and commitment. We fix his attention on the siege, force him to deploy his infantry to deal with it, then strike with overwhelming force when he's committed. It's elegant.\n\nThe keys to success:\n\nBuild fieldworks solid enough he can't ignore them or easily overrun them\n\nKeep the 18,000 concealed or at least uncertain in position until the critical moment\n\nOur cavalry screens must deny him accurate intelligence while giving us clear view of his dispositions\n\nWhen we strike, we commit fully and decisively—no half measures\n\nIf this works, Your Majesty, we could destroy Granada's field army in a single afternoon.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez soberly added:\n\n\"And if it doesn't work—if he sees through the deception, if his cavalry breaks our screen, if his infantry refuses to commit—we're still in strong position. We have the fieldworks, we have numerical superiority, we have the fortress under bombardment. We simply fight a more conventional battle from prepared positions. The plan has a good floor even if the ceiling isn't achieved.\"\n\nFray Hernando spoke quietly:\n\n\"Your Majesty proposes to spend sweat building works, patience waiting for the right moment, and discipline holding forces in reserve until the decisive strike. These are virtues. The alternative—rushing forward recklessly, seeking immediate glory—kills men needlessly. I approve of this approach.\"\n\nThe commanders looked at each other. The plan was solid. The tactics were sound. The execution would be challenging but achievable.\n\nPedro González asked the final question:\n\n\"When do we march, Your Majesty? And should we send word to the cavalry columns to concentrate around Alcalá la Real, or keep them ranging widely to maintain uncertainty about our intentions?\""

One florin per week for skilled carpenters, half a florin for laborers and woodcutters. That's generous pay—we'll have men lining up. I estimate we can hire 200-300 workers within two days, more if needed.\"\n\nDon García Fernández added:\n\n\"I'll organize timber collection here before we march. We have carts, we have men. We can load fifty cartloads of cut timber tonight and tomorrow morning. Stakes for palisades, beams for frameworks. It'll supplement whatever we find around Alcalá.\"\n\nDon Juan de Luna offered:\n\n\"My column can escort the timber carts and civilian workers when they follow the army south. We'll also scout the approach to Alcalá and ensure the route is secure.\"\n\nPedro González turned to a staff officer: \"Draft the message to Rodrigo Manrique. Secure courier, multiple copies in case one is intercepted.\"\n\nThe officer began writing immediately, speaking aloud as he composed:\n\n\"To Don Rodrigo Manrique, Commander of the Western Army, Seville. From His Majesty Juan II, Jaén. We march tomorrow to Alcalá la Real. Will construct fieldworks and commence bombardment. Estimate Sultan will respond with field army within one week of our arrival. When Sultan commits his forces to battle at Alcalá, you will receive signal via relay system—two days' notice. Launch naval operations immediately upon receiving signal. His western defenses will be stripped. Strike hard. May God grant us victory. Signed this 29th day of March, 1431.\"\n\nPedro looked to you for approval of the wording.\n\nInfante Enrique was already organizing the crusaders:\n\n\"The Guardian Company will march with the banner tomorrow. Fray Hernando, we should conduct Mass at dawn before departure. The men need to see the True Cross and Santiago's bones blessed before we advance into enemy territory.\"\n\nPietro Calabrese was calculating logistics:\n\n\"My bombards will march in the center of the column, Your Majesty. With the ox teams rested, we can make fifteen miles tomorrow, camp, then complete the final five miles the next morning. I want to arrive fresh, not with exhausted animals. Where we position the guns depends on the terrain when we arrive—I must survey the ground around Alcalá before committing.\"\n\nDon Sancho de Rojas addressed cavalry coordination:\n\n\"Should I send riders to recall the ranging columns, Your Majesty? Or do we want them to continue screening operations while the main army advances?\"\n\nDon Álvar Pérez de Guzmán suggested:\n\n\"Keep the columns ranging, but shift their focus to the Alcalá area. They can scout the approaches, identify good positions for our camps and fieldworks, and start denying the area to Moorish scouts. By the time we arrive, we'll have clear intelligence about the ground.\"\n\nThroughout the command chamber, officers were already moving—sending runners, drafting orders, organizing supply trains. The army was a vast machine beginning to turn toward war.\n\nFray Hernando approached quietly:\n\n\"Your Majesty, Queen Isabel should be informed of the march. And... she should decide whether to remain with the army or return to safer quarters. Once we advance beyond Jaén, we're in hostile territory. The fortress will come under bombardment. There will be battle.\"\n\nOutside, the sun was setting over the vast encampment. Twenty-three thousand men were about to learn they marched to war in the morning. The sounds of an army preparing—sharpening weapons, checking equipment, writing letters home—would fill the night.\n\nPedro González concluded the council:\n\n\"We march at dawn. Two days to reach Alcalá la Real. Perhaps three or four days to build proper fieldworks. Ten days of bombardment to breach the walls. The Sultan will respond sometime in that window—his spies will report our movements within hours of our arrival. Two weeks from now, Your Majesty, we'll likely be fighting the largest battle of the Reconquista in a generation.\"\n\nHe paused, looking at the assembled commanders. \"Gentlemen, get your men ready. This is what we came for.\"\n\nThe commanders saluted and dispersed to their units. The council chamber emptied rapidly as officers rushed to execute the orders.\n\nThe crusade was no longer preparing. It was beginning.\n\nEvening, March 29, 1431\n\nIs there anything specific you wish to address before the army marches at dawn? Isabel's presence with the advancing army? Final preparations? Or shall we proceed to the march toward Alcalá la Real?"

And I'll dispatch orders to the other columns granting them operational freedom. They'll appreciate the trust.\"\n\nPedro González considered the cavalry disposition:\n\n\"Two thousand for screening is adequate for an army our size, Your Majesty. And the independent columns can do real damage—raid supply lines, intercept messengers, keep the Sultan uncertain about what's happening beyond his immediate front.\"\n\nFray Hernando looked relieved at the decision about Isabel:\n\n\"The Queen will be safer here, Your Majesty. Jaén's fortress is strong, the garrison loyal. She can maintain the household and receive reports.

          "text": "Now we need to determine how quickly and accurately the Sultan learns about Juan's army moving toward Alcalá la Real. \n\nFactors affecting Sultan's intelligence:\n- Granada has 2,500-3,000 cavalry screening the frontier\n- Juan is recalling 2,000 of his 3,000 cavalry for close screening (leaving 1,000 ranging independently)\n- Granada likely has local informants and spies\n- The movement of 23,000 troops is very difficult to hide completely\n- Distance from Jaén to Alcalá la Real is about 20 miles\n- Sultan's main army is positioned 40+ miles south, between Loja and Granada\n\nThe question is: how quickly does he learn, and how much detail does he get?\n\nBest case for Juan (low roll): Sultan learns slowly, gets vague information\nWorst case for Juan (high roll): Sultan learns immediately with precise details\n\nLet me draft a d100 table:\n\nD100 Table: Sultan Muhammad IX's Intelligence on Castilian Army Movement\n\nFactors Affecting Intelligence:\n\n23,000-troop movement extremely difficult to conceal completely\n\nGranada has 2,500-3,000 cavalry screening frontier\n\nJuan recalled 2,000 cavalry for close screening (good defensive measure)\n\n1,000 Castilian cavalry ranging with operational freedom (disrupts Moorish scouts)\n\nLocal Mudéjar populations could provide information\n\nDistance: Jaén to Alcalá la Real ~20 miles, Sultan's camp ~40 miles from Alcalá\n\n1-10: DELAYED AND VAGUE (Excellent Operational Security)\n\nTimeline: Sultan learns 3-4 days after Juan's army departs Jaén\n\nInformation Received:\n\nLarge Castilian force left Jaén heading generally south\n\nUncertain destination (could be Alcalá, Moclín, or Íllora)\n\nUncertain numbers (estimates 12,000-15,000, significant undercount)\n\nNo knowledge of fieldwork plans or bombardment capability\n\nBanner spotted but significance unclear\n\nCause: Juan's cavalry screen highly effective. Independent ranging columns disrupted Moorish scouts, killed or drove off multiple reconnaissance patrols. Local informants intimidated or bought off. Poor weather or terrain obscured movements initially.\n\nSultan's Response Time: Doesn't march until day 5-6 after initial intelligence, still uncertain of Castilian objectives and strength.\n\n11-25: SLOW BUT ACCURATE (Good Operational Security)\n\nTimeline: Sultan learns 2-3 days after Juan's army departs Jaén\n\nInformation Received:\n\nCastilian army (estimated 18,000-20,000) marching toward Alcalá la Real\n\nKing Juan personally leading with white banner visible\n\nArtillery present (bombards spotted)\n\nArmy appears organized and well-supplied\n\nNo specific knowledge of fieldwork intentions\n\nCause: Castilian cavalry screen worked well but couldn't prevent all Moorish reconnaissance. One or two scouts got through with solid information. Movement of 23,000 troops eventually visible despite screening efforts.\n\nSultan's Response Time: Begins mobilizing day 3-4, marches day 4-5 after receiving confirmed intelligence.\n\n26-45: TIMELY AND REASONABLY ACCURATE (Moderate Intelligence)\n\nTimeline: Sultan learns 1-2 days after Juan's army departs Jaén\n\nInformation Received:\n\nFull Castilian army (~23,000 troops) marching to Alcalá la Real\n\nKing Juan commanding personally with sacred banner\n\nFive bombards confirmed with ox teams\n\nLarge supply train following\n\nCrusaders (several hundred) prominent in formation\n\nCivilians (carpenters/woodcutters) hired and following army\n\nCause: Standard military intelligence operations. Granada's cavalry scouts observed the movement from distance. Local informants reported troop numbers and artillery. The scale of movement impossible to fully conceal.\n\nSultan's Response Time: Mobilizes immediately, begins march day 2-3 after departure from Jaén.\n\n46-65: RAPID AND DETAILED (Poor Operational Security)\n\nTimeline: Sultan learns within 24 hours of Juan's army departing Jaén\n\nInformation Received:\n\nComplete army composition: 23,000 troops including breakdown by type\n\nKing Juan commanding with banner (relics location unknown - may think they're with army)\n\nFive bombards with full technical details\n\nSupply train extensive, well-organized\n\nCivilian workers hired for construction (implies fieldworks)\n\nArmy morale high, well-equipped\n\nEstimated arrival at Alcalá la Real within 2 days\n\nCause: Granada's intelligence network functioning well. Multiple scouts observed departure. Infiltrators or paid informants in Jaén provided detailed reports. Castilian cavalry screen not fully effective against determined reconnaissance.\n\nSultan's Response Time: Mobilizes within hours of receiving intelligence, marches day 1-2.\n\n66-80: IMMEDIATE AND COMPREHENSIVE (Significant Intelligence Failure)\n\nTimeline: Sultan learns within 12 hours of Juan's army departing Jaén - possibly even has advance warning\n\nInformation Received:\n\nComplete order of battle: exact troop numbers, unit compositions\n\nKing Juan commanding personally, banner with army, relics left in Jaén (critical intelligence)\n\nFull artillery details: five bombards, capabilities, ammunition\n\nFieldwork construction plans (learned from captured workers or loose-tongued soldiers)\n\nSupply system details including depot locations\n\nWestern army coordination plans suspected or partially known\n\nCavalry disposition: 2,000 screening, 1,000 ranging independently\n\nCause: Major intelligence success for Granada. Possible spy in Castilian command structure, or captured courier with detailed dispatches. Multiple informants providing overlapping reports. Castilian operational security compromised somewhere.\n\nSultan's Response Time: Begins mobilization before Juan even departs Jaén. Army marching within 24 hours.\n\n81-92: NEAR-PERFECT INTELLIGENCE (Major Security Breach)\n\nTimeline: Sultan knows Juan's plans before the army departs - receives intelligence during or immediately after the war council\n\nInformation Received:\n\nComplete battle plans including fieldwork strategy\n\nExact troop numbers and dispositions\n\nArtillery positions and bombardment timeline\n\nStrategy to draw Sultan into field battle\n\nWestern army coordination: knows about relay system and signal plan\n\nRelics left in Jaén (could attempt raid or kidnapping)\n\nJuan's personal tactical thinking and command style\n\nSupply vulnerabilities and timeline constraints\n\nCause: Serious security breach. Spy in command structure, or someone present at war council talked. Possibly intercepted detailed courier messages. Granada's intelligence apparatus achieved remarkable penetration.\n\nSultan's Response Time: Can prepare optimal counter-strategy. Possibly preemptive moves like raiding Jaén to capture relics, or positioning forces to ambush Castilian army en route.\n\n93-100: CATASTROPHIC INTELLIGENCE FAILURE (Complete Compromise)\n\nTimeline: Sultan has detailed advance knowledge of entire crusade strategy\n\nInformation Received:\nEverything from 81-92, PLUS:\n\nComplete western army plans including exact naval assault timing\n\nRelay system details: could intercept or forge signals\n\nJuan's strategic thinking about 10-year campaign\n\nInternal command relationships and potential tensions\n\nFinancial details: treasury status, campaign budget\n\nSpecific plans for post-battle operations\n\nPersonal information: Isabel's pregnancy (if discovered), Juan's vulnerabilities\n\nCause: High-level betrayal or multiple compromised sources. Someone with access to innermost strategic planning is feeding intelligence to Granada. Could be noble seeking to undermine crusade, corrupted official, or sophisticated Granada intelligence operation.\n\nSultan's Response Time: Can orchestrate sophisticated counter-operations. May set traps, forge false intelligence, coordinate with western defenses to ambush naval assault. Has every advantage intelligence can provide.\n\nSummary of Intelligence Outcomes\n\n1-25: Juan retains significant operational surprise (2-4 days delay)\n\n26-45: Standard military intelligence, no special advantages either side\n\n46-65: Sultan well-informed, can respond quickly but no special insights\n\n66-80: Sultan has detailed tactical intelligence, can prepare optimal response\n\n81-100: Serious security breach, Sultan has strategic advantages\n\nCurrent Assessment: Given that Juan held a large war council with many commanders present, hired civilian workers openly, and is moving 23,000 troops through populated territory, the realistic range is probably 26-65 - Granada will learn quickly but without perfect intelligence.\n\nHowever, rolls above 65 represent security failures that could happen with spies, loose talk, or intercepted messages.\n\nPlease roll your d100 to determine Sultan Muhammad IX's intelligence on Juan's movements."

          "text": "**His Resources:**\n- 17,000-18,000 troops (8K professional Granadan, 8K militia, 5K Moroccan, 1K Moroccan cavalry, 2-3K volunteers)\n- 2,500-3,000 cavalry in mobile columns\n- 20-25 war galleys\n- Strong fortifications across Granada\n- Mountain terrain advantage\n- Jihad declaration = high morale\n- ~140,000 dinars treasury\n\n**His Known Strategy (from roll 44):**\n- Mobile defense with raiding (Balanced Defensive)\n- Main field army positioned centrally to respond rapidly\n- Active cavalry screening and harassment\n- Avoid decisive battle on unfavorable terms\n\n**What He Now Knows:**\n- Juan is committing to Alcalá la Real specifically\n- 23,000 troops - larger than his field army\n- Bombards will breach walls quickly\n- Fieldworks planned (civilian workers hired)\n- This is a serious, well-planned offensive\n\n**His Strategic Situation:**\n- He's outnumbered 23K to 17-18K\n- Juan's plan (fieldworks + bombardment + concentrated army) is sound\n- If Alcalá falls, it opens the frontier\n- He needs to either:\n  1. Prevent the siege succeeding\n  2. Make the siege so costly Juan can't continue\n  3. Avoid battle and accept losing Alcalá\n  4. Find a way to turn disadvantage into advantage\n\nI recognize the political complexity. A direct abandonment risks losing credibility after the jihad declaration. My cavalry and mountain knowledge offer strategic flexibility. I'll need a nuanced approach that preserves military integrity while managing political expectations. The goal is to minimize losses and maintain strategic positioning, potentially using terrain and mobility to my advantage.\n\nThe Sultan faces constrained options between passive retreat and suicidal confrontation. Moderate strategies involving selective engagement and tactical withdrawal seem most prudent. Preserving core military strength matters more than defending a single fortress.\n\nPotential approaches range from cautious harassment to calculated relief attempts. The key is maintaining maneuverability while avoiding decisive defeat. Screening movements and leveraging cavalry's speed could provide strategic alternatives to direct confrontation.\n\nTiming becomes critical - intercepting Juan before fieldwork completion offers tactical advantage. Naval and cavalry mobility might create unexpected strategic opportunities that compensate for numerical inferiority.\n\nSultan Muhammad IX's Response Options - Critical Analysis\n\nGiven Sultan's situation:\n\nOutnumbered: 17-18K vs 23K (significant disadvantage)\n\nPolitical pressure: Jihad declared, North African allies watching, must show willingness to fight\n\nStrategic doctrine: Mobile defense, avoid unfavorable battles\n\nIntelligence: Knows Juan's plan, knows fieldworks coming\n\nTime pressure: If he waits too long, fights against completed fieldworks; if too fast, may be unprepared\n\nKey Strategic Insight: Sultan knows Juan will build fieldworks at Alcalá la Real. The critical window is the 3-5 days while those works are under construction. Attack then, and he catches the Castilians divided and vulnerable. Wait longer, and he assaults prepared positions with inferior numbers.\n\nRealistic Range: Sultan is competent but not reckless. He won't abandon Alcalá without trying (political suicide), but he won't throw his army away stupidly either. Most likely: some form of relief operation with the question being timing and aggression.\n\nD100 Table: Sultan Muhammad IX's Response to Castilian Offensive\n\n1-8: STRATEGIC WITHDRAWAL (Unlikely but Possible)\n\nDecision: Accept loss of Alcalá la Real, avoid battle entirely\n\nActions:\n\nEvacuate Alcalá garrison before Juan arrives (800 troops withdrawn)\n\nPull main army back to secondary defensive line (Loja area)\n\nUse cavalry to harass but no field battle\n\nPreserve forces for defense of more critical fortresses\n\nFocus on making Juan's advance as slow and costly as possible through attrition\n\nRationale: \"We're outnumbered, their plan is sound, better to trade space for time and bleed them through multiple sieges rather than risk field army in unfavorable battle. Alcalá can be retaken later.\"\n\nConsequences:\n\nPolitically damaging - North African allies question commitment\n\nStrategically sound - preserves army\n\nJuan takes Alcalá la Real unopposed in days, advances quickly\n\nNo signal sent to Rodrigo - western fleet delayed\n\n9-20: HEAVY REINFORCEMENT + HARASSMENT (Defensive)\n\nDecision: Massively reinforce Alcalá, avoid field battle\n\nActions:\n\nSend 3,000 additional troops into Alcalá la Real (raises garrison to ~4,000)\n\nSupplies for 6-month siege\n\nMain field army (14,000) stays 20-30 miles away at Loja\n\nCavalry (3,000) conducts aggressive harassment: raid supply lines, attack foragers, intercept couriers\n\nNaval forces raid Castilian coast to create diversions\n\nMake siege as costly as possible without risking field army\n\nRationale: \"Let them spend months taking a heavily garrisoned fortress while we bleed their supplies and morale. Winter will come, campaign season ends, they accomplish little.\"\n\nConsequences:\n\nAlcalá becomes much harder to take (weeks/months vs days)\n\nJuan's army harassed constantly by cavalry\n\nNo major battle - no signal to Rodrigo\n\nLong siege could demoralize crusaders or prove their commitment\n\n21-38: DELIBERATE RELIEF OPERATION (Moderate Defensive)\n\nDecision: Prepare properly, then march to relieve Alcalá\n\nActions:\n\nSpend 5-7 days organizing and preparing field army\n\nMarch with full 17,000 troops in good order\n\nArrive at Alcalá after Juan's fieldworks are substantially complete (day 6-8)\n\nDeploy defensively 2-3 miles from Castilian positions\n\nForce Juan to either attack prepared Moorish positions or continue siege while Sultan threatens his rear\n\nUse cavalry superiority to dominate ground between armies\n\nAvoid direct assault on Castilian fieldworks unless opportunity presents\n\nRationale: \"We're outnumbered but disciplined. We arrive in strength, position defensively, and force them to make hard choices. If they attack us, we fight from prepared positions. If they don't, we threaten their siege and supply lines.\"\n\nConsequences:\n\nBecomes strategic standoff - both armies facing each other\n\nJuan must choose: abandon siege to fight Sultan, or fight while maintaining siege\n\nProlonged maneuvering, attrition warfare\n\nEventually leads to battle but on more equal terms\n\nSignal likely sent to Rodrigo when Sultan commits\n\n39-58: RAPID RELIEF - CATCH THEM BUILDING (Moderate Aggressive)\n\nDecision: March immediately, arrive before fieldworks complete\n\nActions:\n\nMobilize within 24 hours of receiving intelligence\n\nForced march with 16,000 troops (leave 2,000 as reserve/western defense)\n\nMarch 40 miles in 2 days (exhausting but achievable)\n\nArrive at Alcalá la Real on Day 3-4, just as Juan's army arrives or begins construction\n\nDeploy to threaten Castilian positions before they're fortified\n\nForce immediate engagement while they're vulnerable\n\nCavalry screens and harasses, infantry positioned to threaten siege operations\n\nRationale: \"The fieldworks are their advantage. If we arrive before they're built, we fight on more even terms. Speed is essential - catch them unprepared.\"\n\nConsequences:\n\nExhausted troops but catches Castilians mid-preparation\n\nForces Juan to either fight immediately or complete works under direct threat\n\nHigher chance of tactical battle on relatively equal terms\n\nRisky but gives better odds than attacking completed fieldworks\n\nSignal sent to Rodrigo when battle begins\n\n59-75: AGGRESSIVE RELIEF WITH PREEMPTIVE ELEMENTS (Aggressive)\n\nDecision: Rapid relief + spoiling attacks\n\nActions:\n\nImmediate mobilization, forced march (arrives Day 3-4)\n\nSend 1,500 cavalry ahead to harass Castilian advance and delay their arrival at Alcalá\n\nAttempt to ambush artillery column or supply train en route\n\nMain army arrives before fieldworks complete\n\nDeploy aggressively, potentially launch attacks on Castilian positions to prevent fortification\n\nUse naval forces for coastal raids to create strategic confusion\n\nCommit 16-17,000 troops, keep minimal western reserve\n\nRationale: \"We must disrupt their plan before it develops. Slow their march, threaten their artillery, force battle before they're ready. Aggression offsets numerical disadvantage.\"\n\nConsequences:\n\nActive spoiling operations may delay or damage Castilian preparations\n\nRisk of losing cavalry in preliminary skirmishes\n\nForces engagement on Sultan's timeline\n\nHigh-tempo operations favor experienced troops\n\nClear commitment - signal sent to Rodrigo\n\n76-88: PREEMPTIVE STRIKE (Very Aggressive)\n\nDecision: Attack Castilian army while still on march\n\nActions:\n\nImmediate mobilization within hours\n\nMarch at maximum speed (arrives Day 2-3)\n\nAttempt to catch Castilian army strung out on the road between Jaén and Alcalá\n\n17,000 troops committed\n\nCavalry (3,000) strikes advance guard, disrupts march column\n\nInfantry attempts to engage while Castilians still in march formation\n\nGoal: Catch them before they can concentrate and deploy properly\n\nNaval demonstrations against Jaén or coastal areas to sow confusion\n\nRationale: \"They're most vulnerable while marching. If we catch them in column, we can defeat them before they ever reach Alcalá. Bold action wins wars.\"\n\nConsequences:\n\nVery risky - requires perfect timing and intelligence\n\nIf successful, could shatter Castilian army in detail\n\nIf fails, Sultan's army exhausted and Juan deploys at leisure\n\nLikely results in major battle Day 2-3 of campaign\n\nDefinite signal to Rodrigo\n\n89-96: ALL-IN OFFENSIVE (Extremely Aggressive)\n\nDecision: Maximum commitment, including western forces\n\nActions:\n\nStrip western defenses to bare minimum (leave 3,000)\n\nMobilize 20,000+ troops total for relief operation\n\nForced march, arrive Day 2-3\n\nAttempt to destroy Castilian army before siege even begins\n\nCoordinate naval assault on Castilian coastal positions simultaneously\n\nAccept risk in west - bet everything on defeating Juan's field army\n\nPossibly attempt raid on Jaén to capture/destroy relics if intelligence suggests they're there\n\nRationale: \"This is the decisive moment. If we defeat their main army, the crusade ends. Risk everything to win everything.\"\n\nConsequences:\n\nEnormous gamble - strips western defenses\n\nIf Juan's army defeated, crusade fails catastrophically\n\nIf Sultan's army defeated, Granada loses everything\n\nWestern coast vulnerable to Rodrigo's assault\n\nExactly what Juan's two-army strategy was designed to exploit\n\n97-100: DESPERATE/UNCONVENTIONAL (Wild Card)\n\nDecision: Unconventional strategy born of desperation or insight\n\nPossible Actions:\n\nBypass Alcalá entirely, invade Castilian territory to force Juan to abandon siege\n\nSend assassination teams after Juan personally\n\nAttempt massive bribery of Castilian nobles to fracture army\n\nCall for immediate massive reinforcements from North Africa (months away)\n\nScorched earth around Alcalá - burn everything to deny supplies\n\nOffer unexpected diplomatic settlement to buy time\n\nSome combination of highly unconventional moves\n\nRationale: \"Conventional response leads to defeat. Must try something unexpected.\"\n\nConsequences: Unpredictable - could be brilliant or disastrous\n\nMy Assessment\n\nMost Likely Range: 39-75 (Rapid to Aggressive Relief)\n\nA competent Sultan who:\n\nUnderstands he's outnumbered\n\nKnows fieldworks are coming\n\nFeels political pressure to fight\n\nHas mobile defense doctrine\n\n...will likely choose rapid relief (39-58) or aggressive relief with spoiling (59-75). The key insight is attacking before fieldworks are complete. This gives him best realistic chance without being suicidal.\n\nLess Likely:\n\n1-20: Too passive given jihad and political pressure\n\n76-88: Very risky, requires perfect execution\n\n89-100: Desperate/reckless, contradicts his demonstrated competence\n\nThe Critical Variable: How much does Sultan value avoiding unfavorable battle (defensive doctrine) vs. seizing the window before fieldworks complete (tactical opportunity)?\n\nPlease roll d100 for Sultan Muhammad IX's chosen response."

Let me think about the timeline:\n\n- Day 1: Juan's army departs Jaén (morning)\n- Day 1-2: Army marches toward Alcalá la Real (20 miles, arrives after 1.5 days of travel per user)\n- Day 2 (afternoon/evening): Juan's army arrives at Alcalá la Real, begins setting up camp\n- Day 2-3: Begin construction of fieldworks, positioning artillery, hiring workers start arriving\n- Day 3-4: Sultan's army arrives (forced march, 40 miles in 2 days)\n\nSo Juan has maybe 1-2 days at most before Sultan arrives. The question is: when and how well do Juan's cavalry scouts detect the Sultan's approaching army?\n\nFactors affecting Castilian cavalry intelligence:\n\nPROS (Good Detection):\n- 2,000 cavalry recalled for close screening - substantial force\n- Six experienced column commanders, frontier veterans\n- Know general area Sultan's camp was (between Loja and Granada, ~40 miles from Alcalá)\n- Cavalry positioned to screen approaches\n- Professional scouts trained in reconnaissance\n- Multiple columns can triangulate information\n\nCONS (Poor Detection):\n- Sultan is conducting forced march (moving fast)\n- Granada has 3,000 cavalry screening their own army\n- Sultan's cavalry experienced at counter-reconnaissance\n- Terrain is Granada's home ground - they know it better\n- Sultan moving through multiple possible approaches\n- Castilian cavalry also dealing with operational freedom columns scattered\n- Limited time - Sultan arrives quickly\n\nLet me draft a table covering:\n1. How early Castilians detect Sultan's movement\n2. How accurate the intelligence is\n3. Whether they detect his speed/urgency\n\nThe range should be from \"no warning, Sultan appears suddenly\" to \"perfect early warning with complete information.\"\n\nD100 Table: Castilian Cavalry Intelligence on Sultan's Rapid Relief\n\nTimeline Context:\n\nDay 1 (morning): Juan departs Jaén\n\nDay 2 (afternoon): Juan arrives Alcalá la Real, begins camp setup\n\nDay 3: Begin fieldwork construction\n\nDay 3-4: Sultan's army arrives (forced march, 40 miles)\n\nFactors Affecting Detection:\n\nPROS:\n\n2,000 cavalry screening army (substantial force)\n\nExperienced frontier commanders know terrain\n\nMultiple columns can triangulate information\n\nKnow general area of Sultan's camp (~40 miles south)\n\nProfessional scouts trained in reconnaissance\n\nCONS:\n\nSultan moving fast (forced march, 20 miles/day)\n\nGranada's 3,000 cavalry screening their own movement\n\nMoorish cavalry knows terrain better (home ground)\n\nSultan could use multiple approach routes\n\nCounter-reconnaissance by experienced Moroccan horsemen\n\nLimited time window to detect\n\nD100 Table: Detection of Sultan's Rapid Relief Force\n\n1-5: TOTAL SURPRISE (Catastrophic Failure)\n\nWhen Detected: Sultan's army spotted only when it appears on horizon, Day 3 evening or Day 4 morning\n\nIntelligence Quality:\n\nFirst warning: Scouts galloping in shouting \"THE MOORS ARE HERE!\"\n\nNo advance warning at all\n\nDon't know exact numbers until they deploy\n\nNo time to prepare or adjust positions\n\nFieldworks barely begun (maybe 1 day of construction)\n\nWhat Went Wrong: Granada's cavalry screen completely dominated. Killed or drove off all Castilian scouts in the critical approach zone. Sultan possibly used deception - feints toward other areas while main force approached via unexpected route. Night marching. Castilian cavalry focused wrong direction or too far out.\n\nConsequences: Complete tactical surprise. Juan's army must respond immediately with minimal preparation. Fieldworks useless. Exactly what Sultan hoped for.\n\n6-15: MINIMAL WARNING (Major Failure)\n\nWhen Detected: Morning of Day 3 (Sultan arrives evening Day 3 or morning Day 4)\n\nIntelligence Quality:\n\nSingle scout returns: \"Large force approaching from south, perhaps 10-15 miles away\"\n\nUncertain numbers (\"many thousands\")\n\nUncertain composition (infantry? cavalry? both?)\n\nNo details on Sultan's intentions or deployment\n\n6-12 hours warning at most\n\nWhat Went Wrong: Granada's cavalry screen highly effective. Most Castilian scouts intercepted or driven back. Only one or two got through with fragmentary information. Sultan used terrain and speed effectively.\n\nConsequences: Minimal time to adjust. Fieldworks barely started. Can form basic defensive positions but not much more. Battle on Sultan's preferred timeline.\n\n16-30: LATE WARNING (Significant Failure)\n\nWhen Detected: Evening of Day 2 or early morning Day 3\n\nIntelligence Quality:\n\nScouts report: \"Large army departing Sultan's camp, moving north toward Alcalá\"\n\nEstimated 15,000-18,000 troops (reasonably accurate)\n\nMoving fast (forced march pace observed)\n\nWill arrive in 24-36 hours\n\nGeneral direction known but not exact approach route\n\nWhat Went Wrong: Castilian cavalry detected movement but Granada's screening delayed the information. Counter-reconnaissance effective. Scouts had to ride hard to get back with warning, some didn't make it.\n\nConsequences: One day warning. Can accelerate some preparations, position troops more effectively, but fieldworks still incomplete. Battle comes before Juan fully ready.\n\n31-50: ADEQUATE WARNING (Moderate Success)\n\nWhen Detected: Day 2, afternoon (while Juan's army still marching or just arriving)\n\nIntelligence Quality:\n\nMultiple scout reports: \"Sultan mobilizing entire field army\"\n\nEstimated 16,000-17,000 troops (accurate)\n\nForced march pace confirmed - will arrive Day 3-4\n\nComposition: roughly 10,000 infantry, 6,000-7,000 cavalry\n\nApproaching from south-southwest (general direction)\n\n36-48 hours warning\n\nWhat Happened: Castilian cavalry scouts observed Sultan's camp mobilization. Some scouts penetrated screening forces, others triangulated from multiple sightings. Enough information got through despite Granada's counter-reconnaissance efforts.\n\nConsequences: Reasonable warning. Juan knows battle coming quickly. Can make informed decisions about fieldwork construction vs. defensive positioning. Not ideal but workable.\n\n51-70: GOOD WARNING (Significant Success)\n\nWhen Detected: Day 1, evening or Day 2, early morning\n\nIntelligence Quality:\n\nScout reports within 12 hours of Sultan's departure\n\n\"Sultan's entire field army marching north - approximately 17,000 troops\"\n\nForced march pace noted - exhausting troops for speed\n\nComposition breakdown: 9,000-10,000 infantry including Moroccan professionals, 7,000 cavalry\n\nSpecific route information: \"Using main road from Loja toward Alcalá\"\n\nSupply train minimal - traveling light for speed\n\n48-60 hours warning\n\nWhat Happened: Castilian cavalry did its job well. Multiple columns observed Sultan's movement from different angles. Some scouts penetrated close enough to observe camp breakdown and departure. Cross-referenced reports provided accurate picture.\n\nConsequences: Excellent warning. Juan has nearly 2 days to prepare. Can make informed strategic decisions. Build some fieldworks or prepare pure defensive positions. Position troops optimally. Still not enough time for complete fortifications but significant advantage.\n\n71-85: EXCELLENT WARNING (Major Success)\n\nWhen Detected: Day 1, afternoon - within hours of Sultan's mobilization\n\nIntelligence Quality:\n\nImmediate report: \"Sultan mobilizing now - full field army\"\n\nAccurate count: 16,000-17,000 troops\n\nDetailed composition with unit breakdowns\n\nRoute information: specific roads and approach vectors\n\nTimeline: \"Will reach Alcalá area in 2.5-3 days of hard marching\"\n\nCommander identified: Sultan Muhammad IX personally leading\n\nMorale assessment: troops being pushed hard, forced march pace\n\nSupply situation: light supplies, planning aggressive action\n\nWhat Happened: Castilian cavalry excellence. Scouts positioned perfectly to observe Sultan's camp. Multiple overlapping reports from different columns. Possibly captured a messenger or interrogated a prisoner. Professional reconnaissance at its best.\n\nConsequences: Near-perfect warning. Juan knows everything relevant. Can accelerate march if needed, or slow down to let Sultan exhaust his troops. Can prepare optimal positions. Complete strategic flexibility based on excellent intelligence.\n\n86-95: ADVANCE WARNING (Exceptional Success)\n\nWhen Detected: Day 1, morning or even late Day 0 (before Juan departs) - scouts detected Sultan's preparation to mobilize\n\nIntelligence Quality:\n\nWarning before Sultan even marches: \"Sultan preparing to mobilize - appears imminent\"\n\nFull intelligence continues as Sultan marches\n\nComplete order of battle\n\nExact route and timeline\n\nStrategic intent understood: \"Attempting to catch us before fieldworks complete\"\n\nDetailed tactical information: deployment plans, cavalry screen positions\n\nEven psychological intelligence: \"Sultan under pressure to fight, taking calculated risk\"\n\nWhat Happened: Castilian cavalry exceptional performance. Scouts deeply embedded in observation of Sultan's camp. Possibly turned informant providing inside information. Multiple intelligence sources cross-confirming. Professional intelligence operation.\n\nConsequences: Complete strategic advantage. Juan can adjust entire plan. Could delay march, accelerate, choose different target, or prepare perfect counter to Sultan's rapid relief. Maximum flexibility and advantage.\n\n96-100: PERFECT INTELLIGENCE (Critical Success)\n\nWhen Detected: Continuous intelligence from before Sultan mobilizes through entire march\n\nIntelligence Quality:\nEverything from 86-95, PLUS:\n\nHour-by-hour updates on Sultan's position during march\n\nDetailed unit dispositions and commanders\n\nInternal Granada command discussions (from spies or turned officers)\n\nSultan's exact tactical plan and intended deployment\n\nPsychological state of troops (morale, exhaustion level)\n\nSupply shortages or problems during forced march\n\nDissent or disagreements in Granada command\n\nPerfect information allowing perfect counter-strategy\n\nWhat Happened: Intelligence coup. Combination of exceptional cavalry work, turned informant in Sultan's camp, intercepted messages, and multiple overlapping sources. Everything Juan needs to know.\n\nConsequences: Overwhelming intelligence advantage. Juan can orchestrate perfect response. Could set ambush, choose battle ground, exploit every weakness. Sultan's rapid relief turns into potential disaster for him.\n\nMy Assessment\n\nRealistic Range: 31-70 (Adequate to Good Warning)\n\nGiven:\n\nCompetent Castilian cavalry commanders\n\n2,000 screening cavalry is substantial\n\nBut Sultan conducting forced march (moves fast)\n\nGranada's 3,000 cavalry providing counter-reconnaissance\n\nHome ground advantage to Moors\n\nMost likely: Juan gets 36-60 hours warning - enough to know Sultan coming quickly, basic force composition, general timeline. Not perfect but workable.\n\nHigher rolls (71+) require exceptional cavalry performance or Sultan making mistakes.\n\nLower rolls (1-30) require Granada's cavalry dominating completely or Sultan using deception masterfully.\n\nPlease roll d100 to determine quality of Castilian cavalry intelligence on Sultan's rapid relief force."

          "text": "Timeline:\n- Day 0 (March 30): Juan's army departs Jaén in morning\n- Day 1 (March 31): Army on march, arrives Alcalá area late afternoon/evening\n- Day 2 (April 1): Begin setting up camp, starting preparations\n- Sultan departs his camp (forced march begins)\n- Late Day 1 or early Day 2: Scouts report Sultan's movement\n- Day 3-4: Sultan arrives\n\nSo Juan gets the intelligence either on evening of Day 1 (March 31) or morning of Day 2 (April 1). This gives him roughly 48-60 hours before Sultan arrives.\n\nI need to:\n1. Describe the march from Jaén to Alcalá la Real\n2. Show the scout returning with intelligence\n3. Show commanders reacting to the news\n4. Show the camp adjusting plans based on intelligence\n5. NOT write Juan's dialogue or actions - stop when he needs to make decisions\n\nLet me paint this scene naturally, showing the army's movement, then the intelligence arriving, then the command response.\n\nDay 1 - March 30, 1431: The March to Alcalá la Real\n\nThe army departed Jaén at dawn, a vast column stretching for miles. Twenty-three thousand men, their equipment, supply wagons, and the five massive bombards with their ox teams created a procession that took hours to fully clear the fortress gates.\n\nThe white banner rode at the column's center, carried by the Guardian Company. Even without the relics physically present, the sacred cloth seemed to draw every eye. Men crossed themselves as it passed. The morning sun caught the embroidered cross, making it shine against the white silk.\n\nPietro Calabrese's bombards moved in the middle of the column, each gun requiring its team of eight oxen and a cart of ammunition stones. The Italian master constantly rode up and down the artillery train, checking axles, inspecting harnesses, shouting at drovers in his accented Spanish mixed with Italian curses.\n\nThe march proceeded smoothly. The twenty-mile distance was achievable in a long day for infantry, though the artillery and supply train slowed the pace. By late afternoon, the army began descending from the higher ground around Jaén toward the approaches to Alcalá la Real.\n\nThe fortress became visible in the distance—a formidable structure crowning a hill, its walls thick and well-maintained. Moorish banners hung from the towers. Garrison soldiers could be seen manning the walls, watching the vast Castilian host approaching.\n\nPedro González rode forward to survey the terrain. The fortress sat on elevated ground, as all sensible fortresses did. But the land around it offered several suitable positions for artillery—flat enough for stable gun platforms, with clear lines of fire to the walls.\n\nThe army made camp three miles north of the fortress, beyond effective bow range but close enough to establish presence. As the sun set, thousands of campfires kindled across the valley. Tents rose like a canvas city. Officers shouted orders organizing the various contingents into their assigned areas.\n\nThe civilian workers—nearly 250 carpenters and woodcutters hired in the countryside around Jaén—established their own camp near the supply trains. The timber carts were positioned for easy access. These men looked nervous, some making jokes to hide their fear, others silent and watchful. Most had never been this close to war.\n\nFray Hernando conducted evening Mass before the banner. Thousands of soldiers knelt in the growing darkness. The Franciscan's voice carried across the camp: \"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want...\"\n\nDay 2 - March 31, Morning: The Army Settles\n\nMorning brought organization. Pedro González established command headquarters in a cluster of tents on a small rise giving view of both the fortress and the surrounding terrain.\n\nDon García Fernández and Don Rodrigo de Narváez's cavalry columns had arrived during the night—the 1,000 riders recalled for close screening. They immediately deployed around the army's perimeter and began patrolling the approaches.\n\nPietro Calabrese surveyed potential bombardment positions with Pedro González and several engineers. \"Here, I think,\" the Italian pointed to a flat area perhaps 400 yards from the western wall. \"Good ground, clear field of fire. We can set all five guns in a line. Concentrate on this section of wall.\" He traced an arc with his hand. \"Ten days, maybe less, we make breach.\"\n\nThe carpenters and woodcutters began their work under military supervision. Trees were felled in nearby groves. Timber from the supply carts was unloaded. Stakes were cut and sharpened. The sound of axes and saws filled the air.\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez organized the 5,000 troops who would guard the bombardment position. \"Infantry here, here, and here,\" he indicated on a rough map. \"Cavalry reserve behind. We build earthworks facing both the fortress and the southern approaches. If their garrison sallies, we're ready. If the Sultan's army appears, we're protected.\"\n\nThe diggers began marking out defensive lines. The ground was rocky but workable. Officers discussed where to position ditches, where ramparts should rise, which sectors needed palisades.\n\nLate Day 2 - March 31, Late Afternoon: The Scout Returns\n\nA commotion at the northern edge of camp drew attention. Sentries were shouting, pointing. A rider approached at full gallop, his horse lathered with sweat, foam dripping from the bit.\n\nIt was one of Don Juan de Luna's men—the column still ranging far to the south with operational freedom. The rider nearly fell from his saddle as he dismounted, a sergeant catching him.\n\n\"Where's the Master?\" the scout gasped. \"Where's His Majesty? I have urgent intelligence!\"\n\nWithin minutes he was brought to the command tent where Pedro González, Infante Enrique, and several senior commanders had been reviewing the next day's work plans.\n\nThe scout—a veteran named Miguel de Baeza—was covered in dust, his surcoat torn. He'd clearly ridden hard and fast.\n\nPedro González offered him wine, which he drank gratefully before speaking:\n\n\"Master, my lords—the Sultan has mobilized. Don Juan sent me ahead at full gallop. The entire Granada field army departed their camp yesterday morning. I observed the movement myself from a ridgeline. Thousands of men, hundreds of cavalry. They're marching north on the main road from Loja.\"\n\nInfante Enrique leaned forward. \"How many?\"\n\n\"Sixteen, maybe seventeen thousand troops, lord. The column stretched for miles. I counted banners—at least forty cavalry standards, perhaps sixty infantry units. The Sultan's own banner visible in the center—black and gold, can't mistake it. He's leading them personally.\"\n\nPedro González's expression hardened. \"Pace?\"\n\n\"Forced march, Master. They're not taking their time. Light supply train, minimal baggage. They're traveling fast—making maybe twenty miles a day, perhaps more. When I left them at dawn yesterday, they were already fifteen miles north of their starting position.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez did quick calculations. \"Sultan's camp was roughly forty miles south of here. If he departed yesterday morning and is making twenty miles per day...\"\n\n\"He'll arrive tomorrow evening or the day after at latest,\" Infante Enrique finished. \"Forty-eight hours, perhaps less.\"\n\nThe scout continued: \"Don Juan's column is shadowing them, but their cavalry screen is thick—at least two thousand horsemen ranging ahead and on the flanks. They know we're here. They're coming fast to catch us before we're ready.\"\n\nDon García Fernández, who'd just entered the tent, swore. \"He's trying to hit us before the fieldworks are built. Smart bastard.\"\n\nMiguel added more details: \"The infantry—I could see them well enough. Mix of professional Granadan troops and those Moroccan reinforcements you've heard about. Mail armor, good weapons, organized formations. The cavalry includes many Moroccan light horse—the really good ones, lords. And supplies are minimal—they're planning aggressive action, not a prolonged siege. This is a battle army, not a garrison relief.\"\n\nPedro González studied the map. \"So the Sultan knows our plan. He knows about the fieldworks—or at least suspects them. He's racing to arrive before we're fortified. He wants to fight while we're vulnerable.\"\n\nDon Álvar Pérez de Guzmán, who'd arrived moments before, nodded grimly. \"It's what I would do in his position. Every day he delays, our fieldworks get stronger. Every day he waits, we're more prepared. Speed is his advantage now.\"\n\nDon Sancho de Rojas entered, clearly having run from his position with the cavalry. \"The garrison knows too. Activity on the walls doubled in the last hour. They're expecting their Sultan.\"\n\nThe commanders looked at each other, then at the maps, then toward where the command chain led.\n\nPedro González turned to a staff officer. \"Find His Majesty immediately. He needs to hear this intelligence personally.\"\n\nThe officer departed at a run.\n\nMoments Later\n\nThe command tent was now crowded. More senior commanders had arrived as word spread: the Sultan's army was coming, and soon.\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez laid out the tactical situation: \"We have perhaps two days before they arrive. The fieldworks are barely begun—we've only marked out the lines and started cutting timber. We can accelerate construction, but in two days we'll have basic earthworks at best, not proper fortifications.\"\n\nPietro Calabrese added: \"My guns are not yet positioned. Moving them into place, building platforms, preparing ammunition—this takes time. Maybe one day if we rush, but then we're not set up optimally.\"\n\nDon García Fernández was blunt: \"The question is simple: do we try to complete fieldworks in two days—which means they'll be incomplete when he arrives—or do we abandon the fortification plan and prepare for immediate battle?\"\n\nInfante Enrique considered: \"If we build partial fieldworks, we have some protection but not what was envisioned. If we skip fortifications entirely, we have full tactical flexibility but no prepared positions when his seventeen thousand arrive.\"\n\nDon Juan de Luna's scout Miguel added one more detail: \"Lords, one more thing—their troops looked tired when I observed them. Forced marches exhaust men. By the time they arrive here, they'll have marched forty miles in two days. That's hard on infantry. Their cavalry will be fresher, but the foot soldiers will be worn.\"\n\nDon Álvar Pérez de Guzmán seized on this: \"So if we can force battle immediately when they arrive, we face exhausted troops. But if we let them rest for a day or two behind their own positions, they recover.\"\n\nPedro González summarized the dilemma: \"Two days until Sultan arrives with seventeen thousand somewhat exhausted troops. We have twenty-three thousand fresh troops. The original plan was to build strong fieldworks over four or five days, then conduct bombardment from prepared positions. That's impossible now—he'll arrive before the works are complete.\"\n\nThe Master looked around the tent at his commanders, then toward where you stood, having just arrived.\n\n\"Your Majesty, the Sultan has forced our hand. He's coming fast, exactly as you predicted someone competent would. The question now is how we receive him.\""

          "text": "1. Bronze/iron cannons in 1430s are extremely durable and heavy\n2. Cavalry with swords can't damage the metal significantly\n3. But they CAN:\n   - Kill the gunners (the real vulnerability)\n   - Spike the touchhole with a metal spike (makes gun unusable until cleared)\n   - Destroy wooden gun carriages/platforms\n   - Scatter or destroy ammunition\n   - Blow up gunpowder stores\n   - Kill/scatter the oxen needed to move the guns\n\nThe guns themselves are nearly indestructible to cavalry attack with swords. But making them USELESS is easy - kill the crews, spike the touchholes, burn the powder, destroy the carriages.\n\nI should have Pedro or Pietro explain this clearly, since Juan is asking a tactical question.\n\nPietro Calabrese immediately responded to the question with professional authority:\n\n\"Your Majesty understands correctly! The guns themselves—\" he slapped the side of one of the massive bronze bombards affectionately \"—practically indestructible. Five thousand pounds of bronze. You hit with sword, you break sword, not gun. Even if Moorish cavalry overruns position, they cannot damage the metal. Too heavy to carry away—need the ox teams and many hours to move even one gun.\"\n\nThe Italian gunner's expression turned serious. \"But Your Majesty sees the real vulnerability: my crews. Each gun needs six men to operate properly. Loader, rammer, powder man, aimer, two assistants. If cavalry kills my gunners—\" he shrugged expressively \"—the gun sits silent. Beautiful bronze sculpture, useless for battle.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez added tactical details:\n\n\"There's more, Your Majesty. Even if they can't damage the guns themselves, cavalry raiders could spike the touchholes—hammer an iron spike into the firing hole. Makes the gun unusable until we drill it out, which takes hours or days. They could destroy the wooden gun carriages and platforms—that's all wood, burns easily. They could scatter or smash the ammunition stones. And most critically, they could destroy the gunpowder stores.\"\n\nInfante Enrique nodded:\n\n\"The powder is the real danger, Your Majesty. If raiders reach the magazines and set fire to the barrels...\" He made an explosive gesture with his hands. \"Not only do we lose all our powder, but the explosion could kill dozens of our own men and possibly damage the gun carriages or platforms. That's why powder must be stored carefully and guarded obsessively.\"\n\nPietro Calabrese continued:\n\n\"Also, Your Majesty, they kill or scatter the oxen. Each gun needs eight oxen to move. Those animals are valuable, expensive, hard to replace. Kill the oxen teams, and the guns are stuck where they sit. Cannot advance, cannot retreat. Bronze is indestructible, yes, but immobile gun is useless gun if we must leave the position.\"\n\nDon García Fernández synthesized this into tactical terms:\n\n\"So Your Majesty, the fieldworks aren't protecting the metal of the guns—you're right, that's nearly indestructible. The fieldworks protect the crews, the powder, the ammunition, the carriages, the oxen. Everything around the gun that makes it actually function. A cavalry raid that breaks through could render all five bombards useless in minutes without scratching the bronze.\"\n\nDon Álvar Pérez de Guzmán added:\n\n\"And Your Majesty, there's psychological effect. If Moorish cavalry captures or destroys our artillery, even temporarily, it's enormous blow to morale. The bombards are symbols of our technical superiority, our ability to break walls. Losing them—or even having them spiked and silenced—could shake the army's confidence.\"\n\nPedro González concluded:\n\n\"So the fieldworks serve multiple purposes, Your Majesty. They protect the vulnerable elements around the guns—crews, powder, supplies, animals. They create a perimeter that prevents raiders from getting close enough to spike touchholes or set fires. And they give our infantry defensive positions to repel attacks without having to fight in the open.\"\n\nThe Master paused. \"But Your Majesty's question cuts to the key issue: how elaborate do these fieldworks need to be? Basic earthworks and ditches might suffice to stop a cavalry raid—horsemen can't easily cross ditches or charge up earthen ramparts. We don't necessarily need the elaborate Roman fortifications we originally envisioned if the primary threat is cavalry trying to silence the guns.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez considered this:\n\n\"A ditch six feet deep and eight feet wide, with the excavated earth piled as a rampart behind it—that stops cavalry cold. They can't jump it, can't ride up the rampart. Add sharpened stakes in the ditch and along the rampart, and it's nearly impenetrable to mounted troops. Infantry can defend such a position easily.\"\n\nDon Juan de Luna added from his recent reconnaissance experience:\n\n\"And Your Majesty, the Sultan's cavalry—even the excellent Moroccan horsemen—aren't going to throw themselves suicidally at defended earthworks just to spike some cannons. Cavalry are valuable, hard to replace. They'll probe for weaknesses, maybe harass, but a determined assault on prepared positions? That's not how they fight. They want mobility and advantage, not grinding assaults.\"\n\nThe commanders waited to see how this practical assessment of artillery vulnerability affected your thinking about the fortifications and the approaching Sultan's army."

This is a technical question that Pietro (the gunner) would definitely answer, and maybe one other person with relevant experience. Not everyone needs to chime in.\n\nPietro Calabrese considered this seriously:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you are right to question this. Spiking guns—this is specialized knowledge. Not every soldier knows. The Moors, they have some cannon technology now from the Ottomans, but mostly newer, smaller guns. Whether their cavalry commanders know the trick of spiking...\" He shrugged uncertainly. \"Maybe the Ottoman advisors know. Maybe they taught some officers. But common cavalry trooper? Probably not.\"\n\nInfante Enrique added:\n\n\"I've seen it done once, in Italy. But it was by engineers who knew what they were doing, not cavalry raiders. Your Majesty's point is well taken—destroying powder and killing crews is obvious. Spiking touchholes requires someone to know that's even possible and how to do it properly.\"\n\nPedro González looked thoughtful but said nothing, waiting to see where you were going with this line of reasoning."

Let me check the timeline:\n\n- Day 1: Army marched from Jaén\n- Day 2 morning: Army settled, began organizing\n- Day 2 late afternoon: Scout arrives with news Sultan is coming in ~48 hours\n- Pietro mentioned earlier that the guns are \"not yet positioned\" and that \"moving them into place, building platforms, preparing ammunition—this takes time. Maybe one day if we rush\"\n\nSo no, the guns are not yet positioned. They're with the army in the main camp but haven't been moved to their firing positions yet.\n\nI should have one person answer this briefly and factually - probably Pietro or Pedro González.\n\nPietro Calabrese shook his head:\n\n\"Not yet, Your Majesty. The guns are still in the main camp with their ox teams. I surveyed the position this morning—that flat ground 400 yards from the western wall—but we have not moved the bombards into place. Building the platforms, preparing the ground, positioning each gun properly... this is perhaps one full day of work, maybe less if we rush. But no, they sit idle right now.\"\n\nPedro González added:\n\n\"We were planning to position them tomorrow morning, Your Majesty, once the fieldworks were further along.

The gun that is being deployed should start shooting as soon as possible, but we limit the amount of ammunition and gunpowder we send into the siege camp. We light some fires in the camp to harden the spikes but we let this also create smoke. We do not rush the construction of the fieldworks, we just man it with a force of 5.000 and focus more on digging ditches maybe? Some fieldwork that actually helps a defensive infantry formation. If the sultan decides to deploy, we deploy as well with our full army and with both armies in the field he is forced to face us in battle, giving us the advantage.\n\n\nWe can deploy some troops in the field who quickly flee away when the sultan's forces take the field, hopefullyy selling the idea that we have been caught off-guard."

Maybe one cavalry commander comments on the feigned retreat aspect. Pietro might worry about his gun but understand the tactical purpose.\n\nI need to keep responses shorter and more natural - not everyone chiming in.\n\nPedro González listened carefully, then a slow smile spread across his face:\n\n\"Your Majesty... that's cunning. Very cunning. We make it look like we've been caught unprepared—one gun deployed prematurely, hasty construction, thin defenses. The Sultan sees what he hoped to see: us vulnerable, scrambling. He commits to attack. Then we reveal the full army and force the field battle on our terms.\"\n\nDon García Fernández grinned:\n\n\"And the troops we stage to 'flee'—that sells it completely. Sultan's cavalry sees Castilians running, thinks they've broken our advance guard, charges forward thinking they have momentum. By the time they realize the trap, his whole army is committed and our twenty-three thousand are deploying in good order.\"\n\nPietro Calabrese looked conflicted, protective of his guns:\n\n\"Your Majesty risks one of my bombards if they overrun the position. But...\" he sighed heavily, \"...if it draws him into attacking, if it wins the battle—one gun is acceptable loss. And you are right, with limited powder and ammunition nearby, even if they capture the position, they cannot do much damage. The gun itself survives, we retake it after battle.\"\n\nPedro González was already thinking through the tactical details:\n\n\"The ditches and basic earthworks—yes, that's perfect. Just enough to give our five thousand infantry a defensive advantage against his initial attack, not so elaborate it looks like we're fully prepared. And the smoke from the fires will obscure exactly how many troops we have in the siege camp versus in reserve.\"\n\nHe paused, studying you. \"Your Majesty, this requires discipline. The five thousand at the siege position must hold when the Sultan attacks—at least initially, to make it look real. Some might actually panic when they see seventeen thousand Moors coming at them.

Two hundred sixty-seven devoted men who absolutely will not break. Their white tabards with red crosses will be visible—the Sultan will see them and know these are your elite troops. That reinforces the illusion this is your main effort.\"\n\nInfante Enrique leaned forward:\n\n\"I'd add the Military Order knights—perhaps fifteen hundred from Calatrava and Santiago. Professional warriors, heavily armored, disciplined. They can hold ground against anything the Sultan throws at them initially. And their presence makes the siege camp look legitimate—these are exactly the troops you'd assign to protect artillery.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez suggested:\n\n\"The remaining numbers—call it three thousand or so—should be solid infantry from reliable noble contingents. Not our absolute best troops, but competent. Good enough to hold earthworks, but if some of them panic and flee when they see seventeen thousand Moors coming... well, that sells your deception, Your Majesty. The crusaders and Military Orders stand firm, but some of the levy troops break and run. Looks realistic.\"\n\nPedro González nodded slowly:\n\n\"So: two hundred sixty-seven crusaders, fifteen hundred Military Order knights, three thousand decent infantry from noble levies. That's your five thousand. The crusaders and Orders are the steel core that won't budge. The levies provide numbers and... some of them provide your 'fleeing' troops to bait the trap.\"\n\nHe paused, looking at you directly. \"Your Majesty, who commands this force?

Cavalry without infantry is just... raiders. Dangerous raiders, yes, but they cannot hold ground, cannot besiege fortresses, cannot sustain prolonged combat. They tire, their horses tire. If we destroy the Sultan's ten thousand infantry, his seven thousand cavalry become a harassment force, not an army.\"\n\nPedro González nodded slowly:\n\n\"That's why he must use his infantry, Your Majesty.

Better to lose a small group than the entire line. stay in formation.\n\n\nWe have three distict infantry formations. command them with wisdom and initiative. I will place all of our light cavalry and scouts under direct command of the first battle line to emerge as reinforcements. They will secure flanks and neutralize their light cavalry hopefully.\n\n\nTo conclude the plan; as soon as the main battle line of the enemy is engaged, we send in more battle lines to have them commit their reserves as well. Only then will I activate the heavy cavalry and ride them down. When I do, the infantry is to maintain formation and advance to give the heavy cavalry cover.\n\n\nNow, lets discuss what we should do if the sultan decides NOT to attack and just starts harassing and such."

          "text": "Juan has established a clear battle plan:\n1. Enrique holds siege works with 5,000 (crusaders, Military Orders, professionals)\n2. Three infantry battles (5,000 each) under García Fernández, Pedro González, Rodrigo de Narváez\n3. Light cavalry under First Battle command for flanking/screening\n4. Juan commands 4,000 heavy cavalry for decisive strike after enemy commits reserves\n5. Infantry advances with cavalry to provide cover\n6. Strict discipline - no unauthorized charges\n\nNow he wants to discuss the scenario where the Sultan doesn't attack but harasses instead. This is important - if the Sultan is cautious and doesn't take the bait, what do they do?\n\nThe commanders would discuss:\n- Continue building fieldworks and bombardment while Sultan watches\n- Force him to either attack or watch fortress fall\n- Risk of prolonged stalemate/harassment\n- Supply line vulnerability\n- Time pressure\n\nI should have 2-3 commanders respond, not all of them. Keep it natural.\n\nPedro González nodded with satisfaction at the battle plan, then turned to the alternative scenario:\n\n\"If the Sultan refuses the bait, Your Majesty, we're in a different situation entirely. He positions his army defensively, perhaps two or three miles from our siege works. Close enough to threaten but not attacking. His cavalry harasses our supply lines, our foragers, our couriers. Meanwhile we continue bombarding Alcalá la Real while his field army watches.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez added carefully:\n\n\"That becomes a test of endurance, Your Majesty. Can we sustain the siege and bombardment while his cavalry bleeds our supplies? Do we have enough provisions to both feed twenty-three thousand men and endure constant raiding? And does he force us into the awkward position of advancing against his prepared defensive positions to bring him to battle?\"\n\nInfante Enrique leaned forward:\n\n\"The advantage shifts, Your Majesty. If we attack his defensive positions, we're the ones advancing uphill or across open ground toward entrenched enemies. His cavalry hits our flanks while we're marching. It becomes the kind of battle he wants—mobile defense, us struggling to pin him down, casualties mounting without decisive result.\"\n\nPedro González looked at you directly: \"So Your Majesty, if he won't take the bait—if he's too cautious or sees through the deception—what then? Do we continue the siege under harassment? Do we abandon Alcalá and march on his position directly? Do we try different fortresses to force his response elsewhere?\""

          "text": "We've established earlier that infantry in formation is slow and ponderous. Breaking formation to retreat invites disaster. But there's a difference between:\n1. Infantry deployed in battle lines ready for combat (committed)\n2. Infantry in defensive positions but not yet in direct contact (can possibly withdraw in good order)\n\nThe key factors:\n- Sultan's troops are tired from forced march\n- Juan's are fresh\n- If Juan advances in good order with 23,000 troops toward Sultan's 17,000\n- Can the Sultan safely withdraw his infantry without it turning into a rout?\n\nMilitary reality: \n- Withdrawing in contact with enemy is extremely difficult\n- Withdrawing when enemy is advancing but hasn't made contact yet is possible but risky\n- Requires discipline, time, and the enemy not pressing too hard\n- Cavalry can cover a withdrawal, but if heavy infantry is advancing, light cavalry can only delay, not stop\n\nThe Sultan's exhausted troops trying to withdraw while Juan's fresh army advances... that's very dangerous for the Sultan. If he tries to withdraw and Juan presses hard, it could turn into a running battle where the tired Moorish infantry gets caught and destroyed piecemeal.\n\nSo the answer should be: theoretically he can try to withdraw, but it's very risky with tired troops against a fresh, larger army. If Juan presses the advance aggressively, the Sultan is effectively forced to either fight or risk his withdrawal turning into a rout.\n\nPedro González considered this carefully:\n\n\"If the Sultan deploys his seventeen thousand defensively—say, two miles from our position—and we advance in good order with our twenty-three thousand, he faces a very difficult choice, Your Majesty. His infantry is already tired from the forced march. Ours is fresh.\"\n\nDon Álvar Pérez de Guzmán elaborated:\n\n\"Withdrawing infantry while an enemy advances is extremely dangerous, Your Majesty. It requires perfect discipline and time. The troops must pull back in good order, maintain formations, not panic. His cavalry can screen and delay us, but if we press hard with our advance... his tired infantry trying to disengage and march away?\" He shook his head. \"Very risky. Men start looking over their shoulders, formations loosen, someone panics. Next thing, it's not a withdrawal—it's a rout.\"\n\nInfante Enrique added:\n\n\"And Your Majesty, we're fresher and more numerous. We can march faster than his exhausted troops can withdraw. If we advance aggressively, we'll catch them. At that point he must either turn and fight, or keep retreating and risk us hitting his rear guard, then his whole column unravels.\"\n\nPedro González concluded:\n\n\"So to answer Your Majesty directly: theoretically he could try to withdraw his infantry. But with tired troops, against our fresh and larger force? If we press the advance hard, he's effectively forced to stand and fight or risk his army dissolving. His cavalry can't stop twenty-three thousand advancing infantry—only delay us.\"\n\nHe paused: \"The real question is whether he has the nerve to refuse battle entirely and pull all the way back to Granada's walls, abandoning Alcalá la Real without a fight. That would be politically devastating for him after declaring jihad.\""

          "text": "Juan is thinking strategically - if the Sultan traveled light with minimal supplies, he can't sustain his army in the field for long. Juan is asking if they can use their infantry formations to pin down the Sultan's army and cut off his supply lines, essentially forcing a battle through attrition rather than direct assault.\n\nThis is actually a very sophisticated tactical question. The Sultan's army needs food - if they've been on forced march for 2 days with light supplies, they're probably running low. If the Castilians can position their forces to block the Sultan's supply routes back to Granada/Loja while not committing to a direct assault, they could force the Sultan into an increasingly desperate position.\n\nThe commanders should respond to this with their expertise on:\n1. How long can the Sultan's army sustain itself with light supplies?\n2. Can they use their superior numbers to position forces that cut supply routes?\n3. The practicalities of such a strategy\n4. Whether this forces the Sultan to attack or withdraw\n\nLet me have 2-3 commanders respond, not the whole group.\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez immediately grasped the concept:\n\n\"Your Majesty, yes—this is the key advantage we haven't discussed yet. He brought light supplies to move fast. His army can sustain perhaps three, maybe four days before they're desperately hungry. After that, they must either be resupplied from Granada or they start losing effectiveness—men weakening, morale collapsing.\"\n\nPedro González studied the map intently:\n\n\"The main road from Loja and Granada runs north toward Alcalá. If we position forces to block that road—say, our Third Battle deploys across the supply route south of the Sultan's position—we cut him off. He's trapped between our siege works to the north, our blocking force to the south, and our main army ready to engage. His cavalry can try to raid through, but escorting supply wagons through Castilian infantry lines? Very difficult.\"\n\nDon Álvar Pérez de Guzmán added:\n\n\"And Your Majesty, he'd face an impossible choice: attack our blocking force with his tired, hungry troops, or try to withdraw past them, or sit and starve. Each option is bad. If he attacks, we choose favorable ground for the blocking force and bring our main army to support. If he withdraws, we harass his retreat and he abandons Alcalá without a fight—politically catastrophic. If he sits still... his army dissolves in days.\"\n\nPedro looked at you with clear admiration: \"Your Majesty, this gives us control. We don't have to attack his defensive positions. We just position ourselves to starve him out, and he's forced to either attack us or retreat in humiliation.\""

Draw him in, then the main army destroys him.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez said quietly:\n\n\"The emphasis on discipline is crucial, Your Majesty. If the commanders maintain control of their formations, we cannot lose this battle. I'll ensure my Third Battle understands—hold formation above all else.\"\n\nPedro González looked around at the assembled commanders, then back to you:\n\n\"The council is in agreement, Your Majesty. We have our plan for both scenarios. What are Your Majesty's orders for tomorrow? Do we proceed with deploying the single bombard and beginning the deception, or do we adjust given the Sultan's rapid approach?\""

Every piece—breastplate, pauldrons, vambraces, cuisses—gleamed with mirror brightness. The white silk surcoat bearing the red cross flowed behind as the warhorse moved. White banners streamed from the lance bearers riding alongside.\n\nWithout a helmet, Juan's face was clearly visible—young, determined, unmistakably the king.\n\nThe effect on the camp was electric.\n\nMen stopped whatever they were doing. Cooking fires forgotten. Weapons dropped mid-sharpening. Conversations died mid-sentence. Thousands of eyes turned toward the white figure on horseback moving through their midst.\n\nWhen Juan stopped and raised his father's sword—Non Nobis Domine gleaming on the blade—the soldiers nearest dropped to their knees. Others pressed forward to see, to hear.\n\nHis voice carried across the gathered troops. Get ready for battle. Listen to your lords and commanders in the days ahead.\n\nSimple words. Direct. A young king preparing his men for war.\n\n\"DIOS Y CASTILLA!\" someone shouted. Then another. Then hundreds. The cry rippled across the camp like a wave: \"DIOS Y CASTILLA! DIOS Y CASTILLA!\"\n\nMen reached out as he passed—not touching, but close, as if proximity to the white king brought blessing. Some wept openly. Veterans hardened by decades of frontier warfare crossed themselves and murmured prayers. Young soldiers stared in awe.\n\nThe crusaders, when he passed their section, fell to their knees as one. Captain Fernán's voice rang out: \"THE KING! THE SUPREME COMMANDER!\" Two hundred sixty-seven white tabards with red crosses, every man kneeling, fists over hearts.\n\nThe white banner—twelve feet of blessed silk—hung from its pole nearby, the Guardian Company at attention around it. With Juan in his white armor passing before it, the symbolism was overwhelming. King and banner, warrior and saint, all merged into one sacred image.\n\nWord spread faster than the horse could ride. \"The king! In white! Like an angel!\" Soldiers ran from distant parts of the camp just to see. By the time Juan completed his circuit, thousands had gathered along the route, lining the paths, standing on wagons and supply carts for better views.\n\nThe Military Order knights stood in formation as he passed their section. Don Pedro González was there, along with fifteen hundred armored warriors. They saluted in perfect unison—right fists to hearts, heads bowed. Not kneeling like common soldiers, but showing respect as warriors to their commander.\n\nThe noble contingents reacted differently—some with genuine enthusiasm, some with calculation visible in their eyes. But all showed outward respect. The Count of Niebla removed his hat. The Marquis of Santillana called his men to attention.\n\nBy nightfall, twenty-three thousand men knew exactly what their king looked like. They'd seen him—really seen him, without the distance of throne rooms or formal ceremonies. A young man in impossibly white armor, sword raised, riding among them like he belonged there.\n\nThe camp's mood transformed. The nervous energy of waiting for battle crystallized into something harder, more focused. Men checked their weapons with renewed purpose. Officers found discipline easier to maintain. Even the civilian workers seemed steadier.\n\nAround cook fires that evening, soldiers spoke in hushed, almost reverent tones: \"Did you see him? The white armor? He looked like Santiago himself.\" \"He's young, but... did you see his eyes?\" \"He's really going to lead us. Actually lead us.\"\n\nPietro Calabrese's gun crews worked into the night preparing the single bombard for deployment. They moved with extra care, extra precision. Their king would be watching.\n\nThe forces designated for the siege works—the crusaders, the Military Orders, the crown professionals—prepared their equipment with grim determination. They knew their role now. Anchor the Sultan. Hold the line. Let the king win the battle.\n\nAs darkness fell completely, Fray Hernando led evening prayers. Ten thousand men or more gathered to hear him. The Franciscan's words carried across the night: \"Tomorrow we begin. The Sultan comes with his armies. But we have something he does not. We have a king anointed by the Holy Father. We have the banner blessed by the True Cross. We have faith.\"\n\n\"NON NOBIS DOMINE!\" The response thundered across the valley.\n\nThe army slept fitfully that night. Tomorrow they would deploy the deception. In two days, battle would come.\n\nBut they had seen their king. They knew who they fought for.\n\nNight, March 31, 1431\n\nThe command tent remained lit well into the night as final preparations continued. Messengers came and went with reports. The courier to Seville had departed through the relay system. The single bombard would be positioned at first light. The siege works would begin construction with deliberate visibility.\n\nEverything was in motion now. The Sultan was coming. The trap was set.\n\nWhat does Juan do as night falls and the army prepares for the coming battle?"

The eastern army, fully assembled at 23,000 troops, marches from Jaén toward Alcalá la Real to begin siege operations. Sultan Muhammad IX responds with rapid relief, forcing the crusade's first major battle. The chapter establishes the strategic situation, develops the tactical deception plan, and culminates with Juan's dramatic appearance before his army on the eve of battle.\n\n---\n\n## PART I: ARMY ASSEMBLY AND CAVALRY DEPLOYMENT (March 25, 1431)\n\n### Final Assembly at Jaén\n\nBy March 25, the eastern army stood fully assembled outside Jaén's walls:\n\n**Force Composition:**\n- 23,147 troops total\n- 2,000 Crown professional troops (veterans, well-equipped)\n- 4,500 Military Order knights and men-at-arms (Calatrava 1,500, Santiago 2,000, Alcántara 1,000)\n- 18,000 noble levies (quality varied but all properly armed)\n- 267 crusaders from Toledo (arrived three days prior)\n- 5 bombards with crews under Pietro Calabrese\n- Support personnel, surgeons, chaplains\n\nThe white banner with the True Cross and Santiago's bone hung from Jaén fortress's highest tower, visible for miles. The Guardian Company (now 80 strong) maintained constant vigil. The relics themselves remained in Jaén under guard for security.\n\n### Cavalry Screen Deployment\n\nJuan deployed the 3,000 cavalry in a hybrid screening strategy:\n\n**Six Column Commanders:**\n1. **Don García Fernández de Baeza** (38) - 500 cavalry, Jaén/Úbeda region, aggressive veteran\n2. **Don Rodrigo de Narváez** (42) - 500 cavalry, Córdoba/Écija, cautious and methodical\n3. **Don Pedro Manrique de Lara** (29) - 500 cavalry, mixed including 100 Santiago knights\n4. **Don Álvar Pérez de Guzmán** (35) - 500 cavalry, Andalusian horse, speaks Arabic\n5. **Don Juan de Luna** (33) - 500 cavalry, Murcia frontier, deep reconnaissance specialist\n6. **Don Sancho de Rojas** (40) - 500 cavalry, Calatrava Order, reserve/coordination\n\n**Deployment Orders:**\n- 2,000 cavalry recalled to screen the main army closely (García Fernández and Rodrigo de Narváez's columns, plus support)\n- 1,000 cavalry given operational freedom: scout, strike, delay, raid, use initiative\n- Mission: reconnaissance, screening, disruption of enemy intelligence\n\n**Initial Deployment (March 25):**\nFive columns departed over two hours, each taking different routes into the frontier toward major Moorish fortresses. Don Sancho's column remained as headquarters reserve and courier relay.\n\n### Queen Isabel's Status\n\nDecision made: Queen Isabel remains in Jaén fortress for safety. The army would advance into hostile territory with active combat expected. Fray Hernando assigned to ensure proper spiritual counsel during Juan's absence.\n\n---\n\n## PART II: INTELLIGENCE - WHAT THE SULTAN KNOWS (Rolled 49/100)\n\n### Sultan's Intelligence Level: RAPID AND DETAILED\n\n**Timeline:** Sultan learned within 24 hours of Juan's army departing Jaén\n\n**Information Sultan Muhammad IX Received:**\n- Full Castilian army (~23,000 troops) marching to Alcalá la Real\n- King Juan commanding personally with sacred banner\n- Five bombards confirmed with ox teams and technical details\n- Large supply train, well-organized logistics\n- Crusaders (several hundred) prominent in formation\n- Civilian workers (carpenters/woodcutters) hired, implying fieldworks planned\n- Army morale high, professional appearance\n- Estimated arrival at Alcalá la Real within 2 days\n\n**How Intelligence Was Gathered:**\nGranada's intelligence network functioning effectively. Multiple cavalry scouts observed the departure despite Castilian screening efforts. Movement of 23,000 troops impossible to fully conceal. Local informants or paid sources in Jaén region provided detailed reports. The scale and visibility of the operation defeated operational security measures.\n\n**Strategic Impact:**\nSultan understood:\n- Full crusade army committed to Alcalá la Real\n- Fieldworks likely being constructed\n- Window of opportunity existed to attack before fortifications complete\n- Juan personally leading with banner = main effort, not feint\n\n---\n\n## PART III: SULTAN'S RESPONSE (Rolled 44/100)\n\n### Strategic Choice: RAPID RELIEF - CATCH THEM BUILDING\n\n**Sultan Muhammad IX's Decision:**\nImmediate mobilization and forced march to arrive at Alcalá la Real before Castilian fieldworks complete.\n\n**Actions Taken:**\n- Mobilized within 24 hours of receiving intelligence\n- Committed 16,000 troops (left 2,000 as western defense reserve)\n- Forced march: 40 miles in 2 days (20 miles/day, exhausting pace)\n- Light supplies only (3-4 days maximum)\n- Goal: Arrive Day 3-4, engage Castilians while vulnerable during construction\n- Sultan Muhammad IX personally commanding\n\n**Force Composition:**\n- ~10,000 infantry (8,000 Granadan professionals, ~2,000 militia)\n- ~6,000 cavalry (including Moroccan professionals)\n- Professional core well-trained and equipped\n- Militia component weaker but adequate for support roles\n\n**Rationale:**\n\"The fieldworks are their advantage. If we arrive before they're built, we fight on more even terms. Speed is essential—catch them unprepared. The window closes after 4-5 days when their fortifications become formidable. Strike now while they're vulnerable.\"\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nHigh-tempo operation requiring excellent execution. Troops would be exhausted upon arrival. Light supplies meant limited operational endurance (3-4 days before resupply needed). But tactical opportunity justified the risk—catching 23,000 troops mid-construction offered best chance against numerically superior force.\n\n---\n\n## PART IV: CASTILIAN CAVALRY INTELLIGENCE (Rolled 51/100)\n\n### Detection Level: GOOD WARNING\n\n**When Detected:** Day 2 (March 31) afternoon/evening - approximately 48 hours before Sultan's expected arrival\n\n**Intelligence Gathered:**\nScout Miguel de Baeza from Don Juan de Luna's column rode at full gallop to report:\n\n**Key Information:**\n- Sultan's entire field army departed camp yesterday morning (March 30)\n- 16,000-17,000 troops confirmed (accurate count)\n- Forced march pace - making 20 miles/day\n- Composition: roughly 10,000 infantry, 6,000-7,000 cavalry\n- Sultan Muhammad IX personally leading (black and gold banner visible)\n- Light supply train - minimal baggage, traveling fast for immediate action\n- Approaching from south via main road from Loja\n- Will arrive evening of Day 3 (April 1) or morning of Day 4 (April 2)\n\n**How Intelligence Succeeded:**\nMultiple Castilian cavalry scouts observed Sultan's camp mobilization and departure. Some scouts penetrated Granada's screening forces through skill and terrain knowledge. Cross-referenced reports from different columns provided accurate picture. Professional reconnaissance at good but not exceptional level.\n\n**Additional Details:**\n- Troops appearing tired from forced march\n- Heavy cavalry screen (2,000+ horsemen) ranging ahead\n- Professional appearance despite exhaustion\n- This is a battle army, not siege relief - planning aggressive engagement\n\n**Warning Time:** 48-60 hours - enough to adjust plans significantly but not enough for complete fortification as originally envisioned.\n\n---\n\n## PART V: THE MARCH TO ALCALÁ LA REAL (March 30-31, 1431)\n\n### Day 1 - March 30: Departure and March\n\n**Dawn Departure:**\n- Army departed Jaén at first light\n- Column stretched for miles: 23,000 troops, supply wagons, artillery\n- White banner at column center carried by Guardian Company\n- Pietro Calabrese's five bombards in middle of column (8 oxen each)\n- Procession took hours to clear fortress gates\n\n**The March:**\n- Twenty miles from Jaén to Alcalá la Real\n- Steady pace accommodating artillery and supply train\n- Weather favorable\n- By late afternoon, fortress visible in distance\n\n**Alcalá la Real Observed:**\n- Formidable structure crowning a hill\n- Strong walls, well-maintained\n- Moorish banners on towers\n- Garrison manning walls, observing approaching host\n- Estimated garrison: 800-1,000 troops\n\n**Evening Camp (3 miles north of fortress):**\n- Army established camp beyond bow range\n- Thousands of campfires across valley\n- Officers organizing contingents into assigned areas\n- Civilian workers (250 carpenters/woodcutters) camped near supply trains\n- Timber carts positioned for construction work\n- Fray Hernando conducted evening Mass before banner\n- Thousands knelt in prayer: \"The Lord is my shepherd...\"\n\n### Day 2 - March 31, Morning: Organization\n\n**Command Headquarters Established:**\nPedro González set up command on small rise with view of fortress and terrain.\n\n**Cavalry Arrives:**\nDon García Fernández and Don Rodrigo de Narváez's columns (1,000 recalled cavalry) arrived during night. Immediately deployed around army perimeter, began patrolling approaches.\n\n**Artillery Survey:**\nPietro Calabrese surveyed bombardment positions with Pedro González:\n- Identified flat area 400 yards from western wall\n- Good ground, clear field of fire\n- Could position all five guns in line\n- Estimated 10 days to breach walls with concentrated fire\n\n**Construction Begins:**\n- Carpenters and woodcutters started work under military supervision\n- Trees felled in nearby groves\n- Timber from supply carts unloaded\n- Stakes cut and sharpened\n- Sound of axes and saws filling air\n\n**Defensive Planning:**\nDon Rodrigo de Narváez organized 5,000 troops to guard bombardment position:\n- Infantry positioned to prevent sallies from fortress\n- Cavalry reserve behind\n- Earthworks planned facing both fortress and southern approaches\n- Diggers marking out defensive lines\n- Ground rocky but workable\n\n---\n\n## PART VI: THE SCOUT'S WARNING (March 31, Late Afternoon)\n\n### Miguel de Baeza's Report\n\n**Dramatic Arrival:**\nScout from Don Juan de Luna's column arrived at full gallop, horse lathered with sweat. Rider nearly fell from saddle, clearly had ridden hard for hours.\n\n**Intelligence Delivered:**\nBrought to command tent immediately. Report given to Pedro González, Infante Enrique, and senior commanders. The news was urgent and clear: Sultan's full field army marching north, would arrive in 48 hours or less.\n\n**Command Response:**\nPedro González immediately sent for Juan. The Sultan had forced their hand—rapid relief was underway, exactly as predicted for a competent commander who understood the strategic situation.\n\n**Tactical Implications Clear:**\n- Two days until Sultan arrives with 16-17,000 troops\n- Fieldworks barely begun - only marking and timber cutting\n- Original plan to build strong fortifications over 4-5 days impossible\n- Must adapt strategy to reality of imminent battle\n\n---\n\n## PART VII: THE WAR COUNCIL - STRATEGIC PLANNING\n\n### Understanding Artillery Vulnerability\n\nJuan questioned the nature of artillery vulnerability, leading to critical tactical insights:\n\n**Pietro Calabrese's Assessment:**\n- Bronze guns themselves practically indestructible (5,000 pounds each)\n- Cannot be damaged by swords or moved quickly without ox teams\n- Real vulnerabilities:\n  - Gun crews (6 men per gun) - kill them, gun goes silent\n  - Gunpowder stores - explosive if ignited\n  - Ammunition stones - can be scattered/destroyed\n  - Wooden carriages and platforms - flammable\n  - Ox teams (8 per gun) - kill/scatter them, gun immobile\n  - Touchholes can be spiked (requires specialized knowledge)\n\n**Tactical Conclusion:**\nFieldworks protect the vulnerable elements around guns, not the bronze itself. Ditches and earthworks stop cavalry from reaching crews, powder, and support elements.\n\n**Juan's Question About Enemy Knowledge:**\nRaised valid point: spiking guns requires specialized knowledge. Moorish cavalry likely don't know this technique. Destroying powder and killing crews is obvious; technical sabotage less so. Most likely threats are straightforward: kill gunners, burn supplies, scatter oxen.\n\n### The Deception Plan\n\nJuan proposed sophisticated tactical deception:\n\n**Core Concept:**\n- Deploy only ONE bombard in visible position at siege works\n- Keep remaining four guns safe in reserve, out of sight\n- Limit ammunition and gunpowder at forward position (minimize loss if overrun)\n- Use smoke from fires (ostensibly for hardening stakes) to obscure exact troop numbers\n- Stage \"panicked\" troops outside siege works who flee inside when Moors appear, leaving camp equipment behind to sell deception\n- Make it appear Castilians caught unprepared, scrambling to complete defenses\n\n**Execution Details:**\n- Single gun to fire several shots with Moors in sight (confirm artillery presence)\n- Pietro's crews retreat to rear as battle begins, saving the gunners\n- Bring oxen team back after initial deployment\n- Sultan sees: hasty construction, thin defenses, single gun firing, apparent vulnerability\n\n**Goal:**\nDraw Sultan into attacking what appears to be vulnerable siege position. When he commits, reveal full 18,000-troop reserve and force decisive field battle on Castilian terms.\n\n**Juan's Clarity:**\nEmphasized NO bad troops deployed expecting them to flee. Solid troops throughout. Staged deception outside real positions only. Once deception complete and battle joined, all troops fight with full discipline.\n\n### Force Composition for Siege Works (5,000 troops)\n\n**Juan's Proposal:**\nDeploy crusaders as anchor - most determined troops who will absolutely hold.\n\n**Final Composition Decided:**\n- 267 crusaders with the banner (elite, won't break)\n- 1,500 Military Order knights (Calatrava and Santiago - professional warriors)\n- 2,000 Crown professional troops (best infantry, disciplined)\n- 1,200 reliable noble levy infantry (proven troops)\n- **Total: 4,967 troops, rounded to 5,000**\n\n**Commander:** Infante Enrique\n- Understands the plan: hold firm, anchor Sultan's attention, draw him into committing\n- When main army deploys, becomes anvil to Juan's hammer\n- Critical position requiring absolute reliability - former rebel prince given crucial command as sign of trust and redemption\n\n### Main Army Command Structure (18,000 troops)\n\n**Pedro González's Proposed Organization:**\nThree \"battles\" (large infantry formations) of ~5,000 each, plus heavy cavalry reserve:\n\n**First Battle - Vanguard (5,000 infantry):**\n- Commander: Don García Fernández de Baeza\n- Aggressive, experienced, understands when to press and hold\n- Forms front line, advances first\n\n**Second Battle - Main Body (5,000 infantry):**\n- Commander: Pedro González de Padilla (Master of Calatrava)\n- Overall infantry coordination under Juan's supreme command\n- Heaviest infantry, best-equipped levies\n- Deploys behind First Battle as reserve and exploitation force\n\n**Third Battle - Rear Guard (5,000 infantry):**\n- Commander: Don Rodrigo de Narváez  \n- Cautious and methodical - perfect for holding anchor\n- Strategic reserve, responds to threats\n\n**Heavy Cavalry (4,000 knights and men-at-arms):**\n- Commander: Juan II personally\n- Decisive striking force for pursuit and exploitation\n- Delivers the hammer blow once enemy infantry breaks\n\n**Light Cavalry and Scouts:**\n- Placed under First Battle command\n- Secure flanks, neutralize enemy light cavalry\n- Support advance and screen movements\n\n**Noble Levy Integration:**\nEach lord retains tactical command of own contingents but operates within larger battle structure. E.g., a lord with 800 men keeps his officers and troops together, but entire contingent assigned to First, Second, or Third Battle. Respects noble pride while maintaining operational control.\n\n### Battle Plan - Two Scenarios\n\n**Scenario One: Sultan Attacks Siege Works**\n\n**Execution:**\n1. Sultan commits to attacking apparent vulnerability at siege works\n2. Infante Enrique's 5,000 hold position, anchoring Sultan's army\n3. Main army (three battles) deploys in good order from reserve positions\n4. Moorish infantry engages Castilian lines\n5. As enemy commits reserves, Juan feeds in more battle lines\n6. Once enemy fully engaged and infantry committed, Juan leads heavy cavalry in decisive charge\n7. Broken enemy infantry pursued and destroyed\n8. Castilian infantry maintains formation, advances to support cavalry (preventing isolation)\n\n**Key Principles:**\n- DISCIPLINE PARAMOUNT - commanders communicate this clearly\n- If individual noble charges without orders, others DO NOT follow (better lose small group than entire line)\n- Maintain formation above all else\n- No pursuit until ordered\n- Heavy cavalry pursues broken infantry while own infantry provides cover against enemy cavalry counter-attacks\n\n**Victory Conditions:**\nBreak Sultan's infantry with superior numbers and position. Heavy cavalry rides down routing enemies. Castilian infantry stays formed to protect against Moorish cavalry. Destroy enemy field army decisively.\n\n**Scenario Two: Sultan Refuses Direct Engagement**\n\nIf Sultan deploys defensively 2-3 miles away without attacking:\n\n**Castilian Response:**\n1. Advance three infantry battles along multiple axes\n2. Cut Sultan's supply line from Granada (he traveled light - only 3-4 days supplies)\n3. Deploy in front of his position\n4. Force choice: attack Castilian positions, retreat (politically catastrophic after jihad declaration), or starve\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Castilian troops fresh vs. Sultan's exhausted from forced march\n- Numerical superiority (23,000 vs. 16,000)\n- Sultan's infantry too tired to withdraw safely if pressed\n- Attempting withdrawal under pressure risks rout\n- Supply advantage (Castilians well-supplied, Sultan light supplies)\n\n**Execution:**\nIf Sultan won't take bait, Juan advances aggressively. Sultan's tired infantry faces impossible choice: fight exhausted, or retreat and risk being caught from behind. Either way, Castilians control engagement terms.\n\n### Critical Tactical Discussions\n\n**On Moorish Cavalry Superiority:**\n- Granada's 6-7,000 cavalry (especially Moroccan professionals) are mobile and skilled\n- Can retreat at will, refuse engagement, harass without committing\n- Heavy Castilian cavalry cannot catch light horsemen in open pursuit\n- BUT: Light cavalry cannot stop armored knights from massacring infantry\n- Key insight: Heavy cavalry used against enemy INFANTRY (can't evade), not chasing light horse\n\n**On Breaking Enemy Army:**\nJuan identified critical strategic insight: Cavalry without infantry is just raiders. If Castilian forces destroy Sultan's 10,000 infantry, his remaining cavalry becomes harassment force incapable of stopping fortress sieges or sustained operations. Battle becomes campaign-decisive if enemy infantry destroyed.\n\n**On Pursuit and Danger:**\nClassic danger: Infantry breaks enemy, pursues for glory/plunder, loses formation. Enemy cavalry wheels around and massacres scattered troops. Solution: Disciplined pursuit by heavy cavalry only, with infantry maintaining formation to provide cover.\n\n**On Maintaining Discipline:**\nEvery commander tasked with communicating clearly: STAY IN FORMATION. Individual nobles charging without orders must NOT trigger general charge. Better sacrifice small rash group than lose entire formation cohesion.\n\n### Message to Western Army\n\n**Critical Strategic Coordination:**\nSultan's field army committed to Alcalá la Real = signal for western operations.\n\n**Message Dispatched:**\nFast courier through relay system (Jaén → Córdoba → Écija → Carmona → Seville):\n\"Sultan's field army engaged at Alcalá la Real. Launch western operations immediately.\"\n\n**Timeline:**\n- Message reaches Seville in 2 days (relay system)\n- Rodrigo Manrique and Infante Juan can launch naval assault in 3-4 days\n- Sultan fully committed at Alcalá, cannot respond to western coast threats\n- Two-army strategy executing as planned - trap closes from both directions\n\n---\n\n## PART VIII: THE KING AMONG HIS ARMY (March 31, Evening)\n\n### Juan's Appearance\n\nAfter war council concluded and deployment orders issued, Juan donned his full crusader regalia and rode through the camp:\n\n**The White King:**\n- Full white armor gleaming in late afternoon sun\n- White silk surcoat with red cross\n- White warhorse\n- White banners streaming from lance bearers\n- Father's sword (*Non Nobis Domine*) at his side\n- **NO HELMET** - face clearly visible to all\n\n**Purpose:**\nMake himself unmistakably recognizable. Every soldier must know what their king looks like, see him personally, understand he leads them into battle.\n\n### The Effect on the Army\n\n**Immediate Impact:**\nSoldiers stopped all activities. Cooking fires abandoned, weapons dropped, conversations died. Thousands of eyes turned to the white figure moving through camp.\n\n**The Cry:**\nWhen Juan raised his sword and spoke - simple, direct words about preparing for battle and obeying commanders - the response was thunderous:\n\n\"DIOS Y CASTILLA! DIOS Y CASTILLA!\"\n\nThe cry rippled across the camp like a wave.\n\n**Soldiers' Reactions:**\n- Men reaching toward him (not touching, but seeking proximity)\n- Veterans crossing themselves and praying\n- Young soldiers staring in awe\n- Some weeping openly\n- \"Like an angel\" - \"Like Santiago himself\"\n\n**The Crusaders:**\nWhen Juan passed their section, all 267 knelt as one. Captain Fernán: \"THE KING! THE SUPREME COMMANDER!\" Every white tabard with red cross, fists over hearts.\n\nThe visual: Juan in white armor, white banner nearby, crusaders in white tabards - overwhelming sacred imagery.\n\n**Military Orders:**\n1,500 knights in perfect formation. Saluted in unison - right fists to hearts, heads bowed. Professional warriors showing respect to their commander.\n\n**Noble Contingents:**\nMixed reactions (some genuine enthusiasm, some calculated deference), but all showed outward respect. The political message was clear: the king commands this army personally.\n\n### The Transformation\n\nBy nightfall, the army's mood had crystallized:\n\n**Before:** Nervous energy, waiting, uncertainty\n**After:** Focused determination, renewed purpose, cohesion\n\n**What Changed:**\n- Soldiers had SEEN their king - not distant throne room figure, but real person among them\n- Personal connection established\n- The white armor became symbol and rallying point\n- \"He's really going to lead us. Actually lead us.\"\n\n**Practical Effects:**\n- Discipline easier to maintain\n- Weapons checked with renewed care\n- Officers found troops more responsive\n- Even civilian workers steadier\n\n**Evening Prayers:**\nFray Hernando led service for 10,000+ gathered men:\n\"Tomorrow we begin. The Sultan comes with his armies. But we have something he does not. We have a king anointed by the Holy Father. We have the banner blessed by the True Cross. We have faith.\"\n\n\"NON NOBIS DOMINE!\" - response thundered across valley\n\n### Night Preparations\n\n**Army Activities:**\n- Pietro's gun crews worked into night preparing single bombard for deployment\n- Forces designated for siege works prepared equipment with grim determination\n- Command tent remained lit - final preparations, messengers coming and going\n- Courier to Seville departed through relay system\n- Army slept fitfully\n\n**Juan's Night:**\nPrayed. Kept weapons and armor nearby, ready for battle.\n\n**The Eve of Battle:**\nEverything in motion. Sultan coming. Trap set. Tomorrow the deception begins. In two days, the largest battle of the Reconquista in a generation.\n\n---\n\n## CHAPTER THEMES\n\n### Strategic Deception and Flexibility\n\nJuan's plan demonstrated sophisticated military thinking:\n- Using apparent weakness to draw enemy into unfavorable engagement\n- Maintaining multiple response options based on enemy choices\n- Balancing deception with genuine tactical strength\n- Adapting to intelligence about enemy rapid response\n\nThe plan wasn't rigid - it provided framework for response to Sultan attacking OR refusing engagement. This flexibility showed mature strategic thinking.\n\n### The Reality of Command\n\nWar council discussions revealed practical military realities:\n- Artillery vulnerability isn't the bronze, it's everything around it\n- Light cavalry can't be caught by heavy cavalry, but can't stop heavy infantry either\n- Pursuing broken enemies is where victories are won but also where discipline breaks\n- Infantry without cavalry support is vulnerable; cavalry without infantry is just raiders\n\nJuan's questions showed he was learning practical warfare from experienced commanders while contributing strategic insights they respected.\n\n### Discipline as Foundation of Victory\n\nRepeated emphasis throughout planning: maintain formation discipline above all else.\n\n**Why Critical:**\n- Moorish cavalry will try to provoke reckless pursuit\n- Individual nobles seeking glory can break formations\n- Routing enemies tempt soldiers to abandon positions for plunder\n- Success requires coordinated actions across 23,000 troops\n\nMessage driven home: Better sacrifice small rash group than lose formation cohesion.\n\n### The King as Symbol\n\nJuan's ride through camp wasn't mere pageantry - it was essential leadership:\n- Made himself personally known to troops who would fight for him\n- Created emotional/spiritual connection beyond command structure\n- The white armor became visible rallying point in battle\n- Showed he would personally lead, not command from distant safety\n\nEffect on morale was tangible and immediate - army transformed from nervous to determined.\n\n### Two-Army Strategy Executing\n\nWestern message sent at exactly right moment:\n- Sultan committed his field army to Alcalá la Real\n- Western coast vulnerable with only 2,000 troops defending\n- Rodrigo and Infante Juan launching in 3-4 days\n- Sultan cannot respond to both threats simultaneously\n- Strategic trap closing from both directions\n\nThe plan conceived months ago now executing in real time.\n\n### Trust and Redemption\n\nInfante Enrique given command of critical siege works position:\n- Former rebel now trusted with anchor of entire battle plan\n- Must hold against potential assault by 16,000 troops\n- Opportunity for redemption through service\n- Juan's mature leadership: offering meaningful roles with real responsibility\n\nEnrique's response: \"I see the holy ghost bless you. This is the way.\"\n\n---\n\n## KEY DECISIONS AND ORDERS\n\n**Cavalry Deployment:**\n- 2,000 recalled for close screening\n- 1,000 operational freedom (raiding, scouting, disruption)\n\n**Queen Isabel:**\n- Remains in Jaén for safety\n- Army advances into combat zone without queen present\n\n**Battle Plan:**\n- Deploy single bombard with 5,000 troops at siege works (deception)\n- Main army (18,000) in three infantry battles plus heavy cavalry reserve\n- Staged withdrawal of \"panicked\" troops to sell illusion of unpreparedness\n- When Sultan commits, deploy full force for decisive battle\n\n**Command Structure:**\n- Infante Enrique: 5,000 at siege works\n- Don García Fernández: First Battle (vanguard, 5,000)\n- Pedro González: Second Battle (main body, 5,000) + overall infantry coordination  \n- Don Rodrigo de Narváez: Third Battle (rear guard, 5,000)\n- Juan II: Heavy cavalry (4,000) for decisive blow\n\n**Western Army Coordination:**\n- Message sent via relay: Launch operations immediately\n- Sultan committed, western coast vulnerable\n- Two-army trap executing\n\n**Troop Morale:**\n- Juan rode through camp in white armor, no helmet\n- Made himself personally known to 23,000 troops\n- Dramatic effect on army cohesion and determination\n\n---\n\n## MILITARY STATUS AT CHAPTER END\n\n**Date:** Night, March 31, 1431  \n**Location:** Camp 3 miles north of Alcalá la Real\n\n**Eastern Army:**\n- 23,147 troops fully assembled and organized\n- Command structure established and briefed\n- Battle plan developed for two scenarios\n- Single bombard ready for deployment at dawn\n- Remaining four bombards held in reserve\n- Cavalry screening functioning\n- Supply lines secure\n\n**Enemy Forces:**\n- Sultan Muhammad IX: 16,000 troops on forced march\n- Currently ~20 miles south, approaching rapidly\n- Will arrive evening April 1 or morning April 2\n- Troops exhausted from forced march\n- Light supplies (3-4 days maximum)\n- Knows Castilians at Alcalá, intends to catch them unprepared\n\n**Western Army (Seville):**\n- 12,000 troops assembled\n- Naval forces ready (30 ships contracted)\n- Message en route via relay system\n- Will launch operations in 3-4 days upon receiving signal\n- Sultan cannot respond - forces committed at Alcalá\n\n**Strategic Situation:**\n- Decisive battle imminent (48 hours)\n- Two-army strategy executing as designed\n- Castilian numerical and freshness advantage clear\n- Sultan's rapid relief forced battle on Castilian terms\n- Campaign-decisive engagement approaching\n\n---\n\n## LOOKING FORWARD TO CHAPTER 16\n\n**Immediate Events:**\n- Dawn April 1: Deploy single bombard, begin construction theater\n- Sultan's army approaches, scouts report movements\n- Deception executed: staged retreat, apparent vulnerability\n- Sultan's decision: attack the bait or deploy defensively\n- If attacks: Largest battle of Reconquista in generation\n- If waits: Castilian advance to cut supplies and force engagement\n\n**The Stakes:**\n- Destroy Sultan's field army = Granada's organized resistance broken\n- Western army simultaneously striking coast = two-front catastrophe for Granada\n- Failure = crusade stalls, Sultan retains initiative, campaign loses momentum\n- Juan personally leading heavy cavalry in his first major battle\n\n**The Test:**\nEverything built over months - the pilgrimage, the papal bull, the recruitment, the financing, the diplomatic maneuvering, the two-army strategy - now comes to the test of battle. Twenty-three thousand Castilians against sixteen thousand Moors. King against Sultan. Cross against Crescent.\n\nThe blade has been drawn.\n\n---\n\n**END OF CHAPTER 15**\n\nI've created a comprehensive summary of Chapter 15 in the canvas above. The summary covers:\n\nArmy assembly and cavalry deployment\n\nIntelligence rolls for both Sultan's knowledge and Castilian detection\n\nThe march to Alcalá la Real\n\nWar council strategic planning and tactical discussions\n\nThe deception plan and battle preparation\n\nCommand structure establishment\n\nJuan's dramatic ride through the camp\n\nAll key themes and decisions\n\nChapter 15 ends on the night of March 31, 1431, with the army prepared for battle, the Sultan's forces approaching, and Juan in prayer with his weapons ready. The stage is set for the decisive engagement in Chapter 16.\n\nWhen you're ready to begin Chapter 16, we can start with the dawn of April 1st as the deception begins and the Sultan's army draws near. Let me know when you'd like to continue!"
