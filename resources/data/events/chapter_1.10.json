Juan shows her the banner and sacred relics, and she responds with deep reverence. He promises to build a Portuguese-style chapel in every palace for her comfort. Their relationship is warm but formal — they are betrothed but cannot share a bed until married. Wedding plans begin.",

The weight of the afternoon's deliberations—the careful dance with the Infantes, the measured promises to the nobles, the intricate web of commitments spun across the table—presses upon your shoulders like an invisible cloak. Your mind still churns with calculations: five thousand men from Aragón, the balance of power shifted, the careful positioning of pieces on a board that extends from the Pyrenees to the Strait.\n\nBut now, as evening light slants golden through the high windows of the Alcázar, you seek different counsel. Different companionship.\n\nThe Portuguese princess has been installed in the eastern wing, in chambers that once belonged to your late mother. The servants have prepared the rooms well—tapestries depicting the conquest of Seville hang fresh against whitewashed walls, and you can smell beeswax and rosemary as you approach. A young page, one of Isabel's Portuguese attendants, bows deeply at your approach and hurries inside to announce you.\n\nIsabel emerges moments later into the antechamber herself, rather than summoning you in—a telling gesture of informality, perhaps even eagerness. She has changed from the formal gown of this morning's presentation into something simpler, though still richly made: deep blue velvet with gold embroidery at the cuffs and neckline. Her dark hair is partially unbound, falling in waves past her shoulders, held back only by a simple circlet. The late afternoon light catches in her eyes—that striking amber-brown—as she regards you with what might be relief.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" she says, dropping into a graceful curtsy. Then, rising, her lips curve into something warmer. \"Or should I say—my lord betrothed? The formalities grow tangled, do they not?\" There's a slight breathlessness to her voice, as though she too has spent the afternoon navigating treacherous waters of court protocol.\n\nBehind her, through the open door, you glimpse the solar: a window seat overlooking the gardens, books stacked on a small table, a lute resting against a cushion. The private world of a princess learning to become a queen.\n\n\"I confess,\" Isabel continues, her voice lowering slightly, \"I have been wondering how your council proceeded. But perhaps...\" She glances back toward the solar, then to you. \"Perhaps you seek respite from such matters rather than their rehearsal? I have wine—good wine from the Douro that my father sent—and a tolerably quiet space away from the machinery of state.\"\n\nHer expression is open, intelligent, assessing. Offering companionship on your terms.\n\nWhat do you do?"

It's an intimate gesture, more familiar than protocol might strictly allow for a betrothed couple who met only yesterday, but Isabel doesn't pull away. Instead, her fingers intertwine with yours as she leads you into the solar, and you catch the faintest flush coloring her cheeks.\n\nThe room is warm, lit by the slanting sun and a small brazier in the corner that takes the edge off the November chill. She gestures you toward the cushioned window seat while moving to a sideboard where a pewter flagon and two silver cups wait. Her movements are graceful, practiced—the result of years at the Portuguese court—but there's a slight nervousness in the way she pours, as though still finding her footing in this new reality.\n\n\"Please,\" she says, handing you a cup and settling onto the window seat beside you—close enough that the velvet of her gown brushes your leg. \"Tell me everything.\"\n\nShe takes a small sip of wine, her eyes fixed on yours with genuine interest. The Douro wine is excellent: rich, slightly sweet, warming.\n\n\"I confess I have spent much of the afternoon trying to decipher the currents of your court from fragments and whispers,\" Isabel continues, her voice taking on a more serious note. \"Doña Catalina visited briefly—very proper, very welcoming, but I could sense the weight she carries. And the servants speak in careful half-sentences about the Infantes, about Don Álvaro, about...\" She pauses, choosing her words. \"About how swiftly things are moving. A crusade by spring is... ambitious.\"\n\nShe shifts slightly, angling toward you more fully. \"In my father's court, such matters were often kept from the women's quarters—as though we had no minds to understand statecraft or no stake in the outcomes. But I...\" Her amber eyes search yours. \"I would be your queen, Juan. Your partner. If you would share these plans, I want to understand them. The taxes, the military preparations, all of it.\"\n\nThere's an earnestness in her voice, a hunger even—not for power itself, but for inclusion. For partnership.\n\n\"What have you set in motion?\"\n\nWhat do you tell her?"

You're absolutely right—the portrayal has been somewhat idealized. Let me create realistic tables based on what we know about Portuguese princesses of this era and the realities of royal marriage politics.\n\nHistorical Context for the Tables\n\nPortuguese Royal Marriages in 1430:\n\nPortugal was wealthy from African trade and exploration\n\nKing João I (through his English wife Philippa of Lancaster) had established Portugal as educated and culturally sophisticated\n\nPortuguese princesses were generally well-educated but often \"bred hugely retired\" (kept very sheltered in convents or palaces)\n\nMarriage alliances were vital for securing borders and political stability\n\nPhysical appearance varied widely, but portraits were often flattering\n\nThe massive dowry (180,000 florins) suggests Portugal is eager for this alliance—possibly indicating Isabel wasn't their first choice of suitor elsewhere, or they desperately want the Castilian alliance\n\nBeauty/Appearance Table (d100)\n\n1-15: Unfortunate/Plain\n\nPlainly unattractive features (e.g., weak chin, poor complexion, unfortunate teeth)\n\nPortugal likely offering massive dowry to compensate\n\nMay have been rejected by other suitors\n\n16-35: Below Average\n\nNot ugly but unremarkable; forgettable features\n\nNothing particularly pleasing about appearance\n\nTypical of arranged marriages where beauty wasn't prioritized\n\n36-65: Average/Acceptable\n\nPleasant enough, nothing remarkable\n\nHealthy-looking, appropriate for nobility\n\nWould not draw particular notice either way\n\nMost royal marriages fell here\n\n66-85: Above Average/Attractive\n\nGenuinely pretty with pleasant features\n\nWell-proportioned, healthy complexion\n\nWould be considered a fortunate match aesthetically\n\n86-95: Beautiful\n\nStriking appearance that draws admiration\n\nExceptional features, grace, bearing\n\nPolitical bonus for marriage\n\n96-100: Extraordinarily Beautiful\n\nRare, memorable beauty\n\nWould be famous across courts\n\nPortugal would have leveraged this for better matches\n\nPersonality/Character Table (d100)\n\n1-10: Deeply Troubled\n\nSevere anxiety, possible mental instability\n\nConvent upbringing created pathological fear of outside world\n\nMay be nearly non-functional as queen\n\n11-30: Timid/Passive\n\nCompletely sheltered, no initiative\n\nTerrified of court life, clings to Portuguese attendants\n\nWill do as told but contribute nothing\n\nMost common result of extreme sheltered upbringing\n\n31-55: Conventionally Pious/Dutiful\n\nAccepts role as brood mare for dynasty\n\nFocuses on religious devotions, needlework\n\nPolite but no intellectual curiosity\n\nContent in women's quarters\n\nHistorically most common for sheltered Portuguese princesses\n\n56-70: Reserved but Intelligent\n\nEducated but cautious about showing it\n\nObservant, learns quickly\n\nMay grow into role with time and encouragement\n\nHas potential but needs drawing out\n\n71-85: Quietly Capable\n\nSmart enough to hide intelligence when needed\n\nCan be diplomatic and useful in politics\n\nAdaptable, resilient despite sheltered upbringing\n\nGood partner material but not revolutionary\n\n86-93: Independently Minded\n\nChafes at restrictions, wants involvement\n\nIntelligent and shows it\n\nCould be problematic or valuable depending on husband's reaction\n\nRare for heavily sheltered upbringing\n\n94-98: Forward-Thinking/Exceptional\n\nGenuinely unusual intelligence and independence\n\nWants real partnership and political involvement\n\nExtremely rare for 1430 Portuguese princess\n\nSheltered upbringing makes this nearly impossible\n\n99-100: Extraordinary\n\nOnce-in-generation intellect and character\n\nCould shape history despite gender restrictions\n\nDefies all expectations of upbringing\n\nHistorically implausible but not impossible\n\nReady to roll when you are! Roll first for appearance (d100), then for personality (d100). We'll rebuild Isabel based on the results and continue from there."

After hours of political maneuvering, perhaps the quiet, predictable company of your betrothed will provide some respite.\n\nThe Portuguese princess has been installed in the eastern wing, in chambers that once belonged to your late mother. The servants have prepared the rooms well—tapestries depicting the conquest of Seville hang fresh against whitewashed walls, and you can smell beeswax and rosemary as you approach. A young page, one of Isabel's Portuguese attendants, bows deeply at your approach and hurries inside to announce you.\n\nIsabel emerges moments later, preceded by one of her Portuguese ladies-in-waiting who curtsies and retreats. Your betrothed drops into a practiced curtsy—perfectly executed, as one would expect from years of convent training.\n\nShe is... exactly as you remember from your first meeting two weeks ago. Pleasant enough to look upon, certainly not displeasing, but not the sort of face that lingers in memory. Her features are regular, unremarkable—brown hair pulled back properly under a simple veil, dark eyes that don't quite meet yours, a figure neither slight nor substantial beneath a modest gown of deep blue. She looks healthy, well-cared for, appropriate. The face of duty rather than desire.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" she says softly, her voice carrying the careful pronunciation of someone who has been drilled in proper Castilian by tutors. She rises from her curtsy and stands with her hands folded, waiting.\n\nThere's a brief, slightly awkward silence. She doesn't presume to speak further or invite you in—that would be forward. She simply waits, as she has no doubt been taught to wait, for her future husband to indicate his wishes.\n\nBehind her, through the open door, you can glimpse the solar: a window seat, a small table with what appears to be a prayer book, perhaps some needlework set aside. The quiet, circumscribed world of a nobly-born girl prepared for exactly one role.\n\nYou take her hand—she accepts it with neither enthusiasm nor reluctance, just proper compliance—and lead her into the solar.\n\n\"I thought we might take some wine together,\" you say, more to fill the silence than anything else. \"It has been a long day.\"\n\n\"Of course, Your Majesty,\" Isabel replies, moving immediately to the sideboard where wine waits in a pewter flagon. Her movements are graceful enough, trained, but there's something almost mechanical about them—the performance of expected duties rather than natural hospitality. She pours two cups with careful precision, not spilling a drop, and offers you one.\n\n\"Thank you,\" you say, settling onto the window seat. She hesitates for just a moment—uncertain whether she should sit unbidden—before perching carefully on the other end, maintaining a respectful distance. Her posture is perfect, her hands folded in her lap around her wine cup.\n\nYou find yourself telling her about the council—perhaps because the silence feels more oppressive than speech, or perhaps because after hours of careful political theater you crave an audience that won't judge or scheme. \"I have made a lot of plans today,\" you begin. \"We have started to restructure the taxes on my estates. And there are military plans for the crusade starting next spring.\"\n\nIsabel listens with apparent attention, nodding at appropriate moments. \"That sounds very important, Your Majesty,\" she says when you pause. There's no real curiosity in her tone—not disinterest exactly, but rather the polite acknowledgment of something beyond her sphere.\n\n\"Would you like to know more?\" you ask, partly testing, partly genuinely uncertain what to do with this quiet girl who will be your wife. \"I would be happy to tell you the details.\"\n\nShe blinks, clearly surprised by the question. A small furrow appears between her brows—not confusion exactly, but the look of someone presented with an unexpected situation their training hasn't covered.\n\n\"If... if it would please Your Majesty to share such matters, I would be honored to listen,\" she says carefully. Then, after a brief hesitation, she adds with what seems like genuine concern: \"But surely you are tired from your council? Perhaps you would prefer to rest? I could... I could play for you, if you wish?\" She gestures toward a small lute resting against a cushion. \"Or if you prefer quiet, I understand. My confessor says that silence can be its own prayer after the noise of worldly affairs.\"\n\nIt's not dismissive—there's a genuine, dutiful desire to provide whatever comfort she thinks a husband might want. But there's no hunger for the information itself, no curiosity about the grand plans being laid. She is offering what she knows: music, quiet, prayer, wifely attendance. The things a well-bred Portuguese princess raised in near-convent conditions would offer.\n\nShe takes a small sip of wine and waits for your response, her expression attentive but placid. A vessel ready to be filled with whatever you require, but bringing little of her own to the exchange.\n\nWhat do you do or say?"

This is a question she understands, a topic that falls within her proper sphere.\n\n\"I have thought about it, yes, Your Majesty,\" she says, and for the first time there's a hint of something less rehearsed in her voice. She sets down her wine cup and her hands move to smooth her skirt—a nervous gesture, perhaps, or simply something to do with them.\n\n\"My ladies and I have been...\" she pauses, as if worried this might sound frivolous, \"...discussing what would be appropriate. For the ceremony, I mean. My mother sent letters with suggestions before I left Lisbon. She was very concerned that everything be done properly, that Portugal be well-represented.\"\n\nA small, brief smile crosses her face—the first genuine expression you've seen from her. \"Mama included three pages describing the correct way to process into a cathedral. She drew diagrams.\" The smile fades quickly, replaced by dutiful seriousness. \"I have been praying for guidance, of course. That I might be a worthy bride, that the marriage might be blessed with children, that I might fulfill my duties properly.\"\n\nShe glances toward the prayer book on the table, then back to you. \"Father António—my confessor who traveled with me—says that a wedding is a sacrament, a holy union before God. That the ceremony itself matters less than the state of one's soul entering into it. But...\" another hesitation, \"...I confess I have wondered about practical matters too. Whether it will be in Toledo or Seville? How many nobles will attend? What I should wear?\"\n\nHer cheeks color slightly—embarrassment at admitting to such worldly concerns, perhaps. \"My mother had a gown made for me in Lisbon. White silk with gold thread. Portuguese work. But Doña Catalina mentioned that Castilian fashion might be different, and I would not wish to appear...\" she searches for the word, \"...foreign. Or inappropriate.\"\n\nShe looks at you directly now, though there's still something tentative in her gaze. \"Have you given thought to when? And where? I understand you have much to consider with the crusade and the kingdom. The wedding must fit with those greater purposes, of course. I am ready whenever you decide is best.\"\n\nIt's the most she's spoken since you arrived, and there's something almost relieved in her manner—as if discussing gowns and ceremonies and maternal letters is far more comfortable than taxes and military strategy. This is the world she was trained for: the feminine sphere of weddings and propriety and religious duty.\n\n\"Do you...\" she ventures, then stops herself, as if uncertain whether the question is permitted.\n\nWhat do you respond?

Mama insisted on multiple fittings before I left Lisbon. She was very particular about the seamstresses getting everything exactly right.\"\n\nA small, almost fond smile crosses her face as she remembers. \"The dress is beautiful. White silk with gold threadwork along the bodice and sleeves—Portuguese goldwork, very fine. There are seed pearls sewn into the neckline and cuffs. Mama said it was important that I look like a Portuguese princess even as I become a Castilian queen, that I carry my homeland with me.\"\n\nShe pauses, her fingers unconsciously touching the fabric of her current gown as if imagining the other. \"I do like it, yes. It feels... like home, somehow. When I wear it, I can almost imagine Mama fussing over me, adjusting the veil, making sure everything is perfect.\" Her voice grows quieter. \"I miss her, truth be told.

It would honor her, and Portugal, and...\" she hesitates, then adds softly, \"...and it would make me feel less afraid.\"\n\nThe admission seems to surprise even her—a crack in the dutiful composure.

I will... I will do my best to make you proud, Your Majesty. And Portugal.\" She takes a small breath, clearly trying to steady herself with the thought of you beside her. \"You are kind to reassure me.\"\n\nBut then you ask about piety, and something shifts in her demeanor. Her posture straightens, her hands fold naturally in her lap, and for the first time since you entered, she looks truly comfortable—as if you've finally asked her about something she understands completely, something that belongs to her.\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty,\" she says, and there's quiet certainty in her voice. \"I am. Or at least, I try to be. I pray each morning upon waking and each night before sleep. Father António hears my confession twice weekly, and I attend Mass daily whenever possible.\"\n\nShe glances toward the small table where her prayer book rests. \"I find great comfort in prayer. In the convent where I was educated—the Convento de Santa Clara in Coimbra—the sisters taught me that prayer is a woman's greatest power. That while men wield swords and govern kingdoms, women can intercede with God, can offer up their sufferings and devotions for the souls of others.\"\n\nThere's a gentle earnestness in her expression now, the first time she's spoken about something that seems genuinely hers rather than prescribed. \"Mother Superior Beatriz used to say that a queen's prayers are especially valuable because she carries the weight of so many souls. That when I pray, I should pray not just for myself but for you, for our future children, for the kingdom, for...\" she hesitates, then adds, \"...for the crusade, and for the conversion of the Moors, that they might know Christ's love.\"\n\nShe looks at you directly. \"I have been praying for you, Your Majesty. Since my father told me of the betrothal. For your health, your wisdom, your victories. And I have been praying that I might be a good wife to you, that God might bless our union with sons, that I might...\" she searches for words, \"...that I might be worthy of the honor you do me.\"\n\nHer fingers move unconsciously to touch a small silver cross hanging at her neck—worn smooth, clearly handled often. \"Father António says that my greatest duty as your wife will be to pray for you, to keep a pious household, to raise our children in the faith, and to set an example of Christian virtue for the court. These are things I understand, things I was trained for.\"\n\nShe pauses, then asks with genuine curiosity—perhaps the first truly curious question she's posed: \"Are you pious as well, Your Majesty? I have heard... I have heard stories of your renunciation before the Pope, of the crusade. Father António read parts of the papal bull to me during our voyage. He was very moved by it. He said it was extraordinary, that the Pope himself wept.\"\n\nThere's something almost hopeful in her eyes—as if perhaps in shared faith, she might find firmer ground with this husband she barely knows.\n\nHow do you answer? And what else, if anything, do you say or do?"

When you take her hand, she accepts it without hesitation—this is proper, a husband leading his wife. Her palm is cool and dry in yours, her fingers neither gripping nor pulling away, simply resting there with dutiful compliance.\n\nYou lead her through the corridors of the Alcázar. Servants bow as you pass, and you notice Isabel keeps her eyes modestly lowered, her free hand holding her skirts just high enough to walk without tripping. She says nothing during the walk, content to follow where you lead.\n\nThe chamber where the banner is kept lies in the western wing—a room that has become something of a private chapel since your return from Rome. The door is guarded by two of your most trusted men, who bow deeply and open the heavy oak doors at your approach.\n\nThe room beyond is dim, lit only by the fading evening light through a single high window and by candles that burn perpetually before the banner. The air smells of beeswax and incense—Fray Hernando insists on keeping incense burning here, says it sanctifies the space.\n\nThe white banner hangs against the far wall, mounted on a stand of dark wood. Even in the dim light, it seems almost to glow—the pure white silk, the blood-red cross, the simple inscription: Christus Vincit, Christus Regnat, Christus Imperat. Christ Conquers, Christ Reigns, Christ Commands.\n\nBelow it, on a small altar draped in white linen, rest the relics: the fragment of the True Cross in its crystal reliquary, and beside it, the small silver case containing the bone of Santiago.\n\nYour father's sword—Non Nobis Domine etched along its blade—rests across two brackets on the wall beside the banner.\n\nIsabel stops just inside the doorway, her hand tightening slightly in yours. You hear her breath catch. For a long moment, she simply stares, and then—without prompting, without asking permission—she drops to her knees, pulling her hand free from yours to cross herself.\n\n\"Deus,\" she whispers, her voice barely audible. \"Deus misereatur nostri.\" God have mercy on us.\n\nShe remains kneeling, her head bowed, her hands clasped before her. Her lips move in silent prayer—you can't hear the words, but you can see the intensity of her devotion. This is no performative piety, no dutiful observance. This is genuine.\n\nAfter perhaps a minute, she crosses herself again and looks up at you, still kneeling. Her eyes are bright—whether with tears or simply the reflection of candlelight, you cannot tell.\n\n\"This is...\" she struggles for words, \"...this is the banner? The one blessed by the Holy Father? And the relics?\" Her voice is hushed, reverent, almost trembling. \"May I... may I approach?\"\n\nShe doesn't presume, even now. She waits for your permission, kneeling on the stone floor, looking up at you with an expression transformed from her earlier placid politeness. Here, before these sacred things, she is fully present in a way she wasn't in the solar discussing politics or even her wedding dress.\n\nWhat do you do or say?"

So small are our troubles that we lay hunbly before your glory father but they are so important to us, your humble servants. \nLet faithful Isabel find her place here. She is alone in a foreign land, speaking a foreign speak. Her faith in you shines like a beacon of light father, may it guide her. May she find friendship and comfort here and may she continue to fondly remember her mother in Portugal and the rest of her family. \nLet also those who travelled with her find their place in my court. \nBless our wedding father. This joyous day, our thoughts will be with you as always. May every part of the ceremony go smoothly. Be with Isabel father as she walks through the cathedral as per her mother's instructions. She will do wonderfully and with you beside her, she has nothing to worry about.\n\n\nYou see all father and you know my own selfish soul. I pray I be a good husband to Isabel.

This is her language, her home ground.\n\nYour words fill the quiet chamber, echoing softly off the stone walls. The candles flicker, casting dancing shadows across the white banner and the gleaming reliquaries.\n\nAs you pray for her—for Isabel specifically, naming her loneliness, her foreignness, her mother far away in Portugal—you hear a small sound beside you. A catch in her breath, quickly stifled. When you mention her mother's wedding instructions, there's another soft sound, almost like a suppressed sob.\n\n\"Amen,\" she whispers when you finish, her voice thick.\n\nFor a long moment, neither of you moves. The silence is different now—not awkward or empty, but full. Sacred.\n\nThen Isabel speaks, her voice barely above a whisper, still looking toward the relics and banner: \"Your Majesty, I...\" She stops, takes a shaky breath. \"No one has ever... that is, I did not expect...\"\n\nShe turns her head slightly to look at you, and in the candlelight you can see tears tracking down her cheeks—quiet tears, not dramatic, just the overflow of genuine emotion. Her expression is open in a way it hasn't been before, the careful mask of dutiful propriety cracked.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she says simply. \"For praying for me. For... for seeing me. Not just as a Portuguese princess or a political alliance or a—a womb for heirs, but as...\" She struggles for words. \"As Isabel. Who misses her mother and is frightened and doesn't know how to be what everyone needs her to be.\"\n\nShe wipes at her tears with the back of her hand—an ungraceful, childlike gesture, not the practiced poise of nobility. \"I have been so afraid,\" she admits quietly. \"That I would fail you, that I would be a disappointment, that I wouldn't understand this kingdom or its ways or—or anything. That I would always be foreign and alone.\"\n\nShe looks back at the banner, the relics. \"But if we have this—if we have faith together, if we can pray together like this—then perhaps...\" She doesn't finish the thought, but there's something like hope in her voice.\n\nAfter another moment of silence, she adds, even more softly: \"I will pray for you too, Your Majesty. Every day. For your wisdom and your victories and your soul. And I will try—I will try very hard to be a good wife to you. Even if I don't understand taxes or military campaigns, I can pray. And I can...\" she hesitates, then continues, \"...I can be here. For this. For prayer. For faith. If that is enough.\"\n\nShe's still crying quietly, but there's something calmer about her now. Steadier. As if in this room, before these sacred objects, with prayers spoken over her specific fears, she's found ground beneath her feet.\n\n\"May we...\" she asks tentatively, \"...may we come here together sometimes? To pray? I think I would like that very much.\"\n\nWhat do you do or say?"

I understand.\"\n\nBut when you mention the chapel in Toledo—a space that will be partly hers, partly Portuguese, a place for daily prayer together—her expression transforms. The tears stop, replaced by something like wonder. \"Every evening?\" she repeats, as if wanting to be sure she heard correctly. \"Together?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" you confirm.\n\n\"That is...\" she pauses, searching for adequate words and finding none. \"That is more than I dared hope for. Thank you, Your Majesty. Truly.\"\n\nShe turns back to the relics then, fixing her gaze on the crystal reliquary containing the fragment of the True Cross. The golden mounting catches the candlelight, and through the crystal you can both see the dark wood—wood that touched Christ's body, that bore His weight, that witnessed His sacrifice.\n\nIsabel stares at it with an intensity that's almost physical, as if trying to memorize every detail, to carry this moment with her. Her lips move in silent prayer again—brief, private words between her and God. She crosses herself slowly, deliberately, then bows her head one final time.\n\n\"I am ready,\" she says quietly, rising carefully to her feet. She smooths her skirts and wipes the last traces of tears from her cheeks, trying to restore some semblance of proper composure.\n\nYou lead her back through the corridors toward her chambers. She walks beside you in silence, but it's a different silence than before—less awkward, more companionable. Her hand rests lightly on your arm, and once or twice you catch her glancing at you with something that might be gratitude, or perhaps the beginning of trust.\n\nWhen you reach her door, she curtsies properly. \"Thank you for this evening, Your Majesty,\" she says. \"For the wine, and for the conversation, but most of all for...\" she gestures vaguely back the way you came, \"...for that. For understanding what matters most.\"\n\nShe hesitates, then adds with the faintest hint of a smile—small, but genuine: \"I think perhaps we will do well enough together, you and I. If we have faith.\"\n\nIt's not poetry, not grand romance. But there's something real in it—two young people finding common ground in the only language they both speak fluently.\n\n\"Good night, Your Majesty,\" she says softly, and slips inside her chambers, her Portuguese ladies-in-waiting rising to attend her as the door closes.\n\nYou stand in the corridor for a moment, the weight of the day settling back onto your shoulders. The evening has grown late. Behind you lies the council's decisions, the military plans, the tax reforms, the intricate web of noble politics. Ahead lies tomorrow, and all the tomorrows after that.\n\nThe crusade. The wedding. The kingdom. And now, a wife who will pray beside you even if she cannot strategize beside you.\n\nStatus Summary:\n\nDate: November 8, 1430, Evening\n\nLocation: Alcázar of Seville\n\nIsabel: Connection established through shared faith; daily prayer routine promised in Toledo chapel\n\nNext Major Events: Departure for Toledo (late December), Wedding (late January/February 1431)\n\nWhat do you do next?

          "text": "**Historical Context for Betrothed Couples in 1430:**\n\n1. **Betrothal vs. Marriage:** A betrothal (esponsales) was a formal contract but NOT the same as marriage. The couple was not yet married in the eyes of the Church.\n\n2. **Consummation:** Sexual relations were absolutely forbidden before the actual wedding ceremony and blessing. This was a serious matter - the marriage needed to be consummated AFTER the religious ceremony to be valid and to ensure legitimacy of heirs.\n\n3. **Physical Contact:** Some degree of chaste contact was permitted:\n   - Holding hands (as Juan has already done)\n   - Walking arm in arm\n   - A kiss on the hand or cheek might be acceptable in some contexts\n   - Brief, chaste embraces might be tolerated\n\n4. **Chaperoning:** A betrothed couple, especially royalty, would typically not be left completely alone for extended periods. There would be attendants, ladies-in-waiting, or other chaperones present or nearby.\n\n5. **Sleeping arrangements:** Absolutely separate chambers until after the wedding. The wedding night consummation was crucial for legitimacy.\n\n6. **The Church's position:** The Catholic Church was very strict about this. Sexual relations before marriage was fornication - a mortal sin. For royalty, this was even more important because:\n   - Questions about legitimacy of heirs\n   - Questions about whether a \"true\" marriage had occurred\n   - Potential annulment issues\n   - Scandal\n\n7. **Political considerations:** Given that this is a Portuguese alliance with a huge dowry, both kingdoms would be VERY careful about propriety. Any hint of impropriety before the wedding could:\n   - Damage Isabel's reputation\n   - Insult Portugal\n   - Create grounds for annulment\n   - Question legitimacy of any resulting children\n\n8. **Juan's character:** His deep religious convictions would make him particularly cautious about maintaining strict moral boundaries. As someone who recently made a significant papal renunciation, he would be acutely aware of and committed to following Church teachings precisely.\n\n9. **Practical timeline:** The chronology reveals some interesting details about their interactions, with Isabel's arrival in mid-December creating a specific context for their early encounters.\n\nI'm detecting a potential narrative inconsistency. The scene's placement in early November conflicts with Isabel's documented arrival date of December 14. This suggests three possible interpretations: we might actually be in a later timeframe, the scene is premature, or there's a fundamental timeline discrepancy that needs careful resolution.\n\nThe critical issue centers on reconciling the stated timeline with the narrative progression, requiring a meticulous review of the project's chronological details to ensure narrative coherence.\n\nExamining Chapter 9's conclusion confirms we are indeed past December 20, which means Isabel has already arrived. This resolves the initial temporal confusion and allows for a more accurate narrative context.\n\nYou raise an important question that requires some clarification about timing and historical propriety.\n\nTimeline Clarification:\n\nI made an error in my opening - I dated the scene to November 8 (right after the Council), but according to the project files:\n\nChapter 8: November 8, 1430 (Council of Seville)\n\nChapter 9: Through December 20, 1430 (tax reforms, military planning)\n\nIsabel arrived: December 14, 1430\n\nChapter 10 would begin after December 20, 1430\n\nSo Isabel has been in Seville for about a week or two by now. My apologies for the dating confusion. We should be in late December 1430.\n\nRegarding Intimacy - Historical Context:\n\nIn 1430 Castile, for a betrothed royal couple before the wedding ceremony:\n\nAbsolutely Forbidden:\n\nSexual relations of any kind (fornication - mortal sin)\n\nSharing a bed or sleeping in the same chambers\n\nExtended time alone without attendants nearby\n\nAny physical intimacy beyond what's listed below\n\nPermitted/Acceptable:\n\nHolding hands (as you've already done)\n\nWalking arm-in-arm\n\nA chaste kiss on the hand or cheek in formal settings\n\nBrief, appropriate embraces (e.g., greeting/farewell)\n\nSitting close together in semi-public settings with attendants present\n\nPraying together (as you just did)\n\nWhy So Strict:\n\nChurch Law: Pre-marital sex is fornication - serious sin, especially for a king preparing for crusade\n\nLegitimacy: Any child must unquestionably be conceived after the wedding\n\nPolitical Stakes: The Portuguese alliance with 180,000 florin dowry depends on propriety\n\nAnnulment Risk: Impropriety could give grounds to annul the marriage\n\nYour Piety: After your renunciation before the Pope, maintaining moral standards is essential\n\nCurrent Sleeping Arrangements:\n\nIsabel: Eastern wing chambers (former Queen's rooms)\n\nYou: Royal chambers (separate wing)\n\nHer Portuguese ladies-in-waiting sleep in adjacent rooms to her\n\nGuards posted outside her doors\n\nUntil the Wedding:\nYou would not share chambers or bed. The wedding night consummation is crucial for legitimacy and Church blessing.\n\nAfter Wedding Ceremony (January/February 1431):\nOnly after the religious ceremony and blessing would consummation occur and you would share chambers.\n\nWould you like to continue the scene from late December (corrected timeline), or would you prefer to skip ahead to another moment—perhaps the departure for Toledo or the wedding itself?"

          "text": "Alcázar of Seville, Late December Morning\n\nYou find Álvaro in the administrative wing, surrounded by the organized chaos that seems to follow him everywhere—scrolls stacked on tables, ledgers open, a scribe taking notes in the corner. He's dictating something about artillery requisitions when you enter, but he immediately stops and dismisses the scribe with a wave.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, rising and bowing. Then, reading your expression: \"Wedding logistics?\"\n\nWhen you ask your questions, Álvaro moves to his desk and pulls out a scroll already covered in his precise handwriting—of course he's been working on this.\n\n\"We have not formally set the date yet, no—I was waiting for your input,\" he says. \"But here's what I've been considering.\" He spreads the scroll on the table.\n\n\"Timeline: If we depart Seville by December 28th or 29th, we can reach Toledo by mid-January. That gives us time to prepare the palace, the cathedral, settle the Princess in her new surroundings. I'd propose the wedding itself for late January—say, January 28th or February 1st. That leaves us February and March for post-wedding matters before the campaign launches in April.\"\n\nHe taps the scroll. \"Invitations: We have not sent them yet because I needed you to decide on the guest list. But Your Majesty, timing is tight. If we send riders today with invitations for a late January wedding, that gives nobles barely three to four weeks' notice. Some from distant holdings—Galicia, the far north—may not make it in time even riding hard.\"\n\nÁlvaro looks at you directly. \"As for required attendance—legally? No. Practically?\" He spreads his hands. \"This is the most important royal wedding in decades. The first wedding of a reigning king since your father. It formalizes a major foreign alliance. Every noble house of significance will feel obliged to attend, and those who don't will be noticed. And judged.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds thoughtfully: \"There's another consideration. We've been planning recruitment for the crusade—thousands of men. The wedding will draw nobles from across the kingdom to one place. It's an extraordinary opportunity.\"\n\n\"Here's my recommendation,\" Álvaro continues, warming to his subject. \"Send invitations immediately to:\n\nAll titled nobility—dukes, counts, major lords\n\nThe three Military Order Masters—already committed, but formal invitation for propriety\n\nChurch hierarchy—Archbishop of Toledo will perform the ceremony, but invite all bishops\n\nMajor city representatives—Burgos, Valladolid, Segovia, etc.\n\nConsider...\" he hesitates, \"...a formal invitation to King Alfonso of Aragon? Political gesture, shows confidence. He won't come, but it's diplomatic.\"\n\n\"Frame the invitation not just as a wedding but as a gathering of the kingdom—following the Council of Seville, preceding the crusade. Make attendance feel like participation in history.\"\n\nHe looks at you shrewdly. \"And yes, combine it with recruitment. Have your crusaders present, the banner, the relics displayed in Toledo's cathedral. Let nobles see the scale of what you're building. Some may pledge sons or men during the festivities.\"\n\nÁlvaro taps the desk. \"But I need decisions today if we're sending riders:\n\nExact date for the ceremony—late January or early February?\n\nGuest list—cast wide or limited?\n\nDo we explicitly tie this to crusade recruitment in the invitation, or keep that subtle?\n\nWhen do we depart Seville?\n\nDoes the Princess travel with us, or separately with her Portuguese escort?\"\n\nHe grins slightly. \"Also, the Archbishop of Toledo's secretary has already sent three letters asking about ceremony details. The Church loves elaborate planning.\"\n\nWhat do you decide?"

          "text": "Álvaro nods at your question about the nobles. \"Yes, most departed within days of the Council—back to their estates for the winter. A few remained in Seville for various reasons, but the vast majority left by mid-November. They'll need to be summoned again.\"\n\n\"February 15th,\" he repeats, calculating mentally. \"That gives us seven weeks from today if we send riders immediately. For nobles in Seville, Córdoba, even Burgos—plenty of time. For those in Galicia, Asturias, the far reaches? Tight, as you say, but doable if they ride hard. Some may send representatives rather than come themselves due to winter travel.\" He nods decisively. \"It's reasonable. I agree.\"\n\nHe makes a note on his scroll. \"February 15, 1431. Toledo Cathedral. Done.\"\n\nWhen you ask about the Archbishop's choices, Álvaro actually chuckles and reaches for another scroll—this one covered in someone else's elaborate handwriting, clearly from a church scribe.\n\n\"Archbishop Gutiérrez Álvarez de Toledo is... thorough,\" Álvaro says diplomatically. \"He's sent a list of questions that—\"\n\nBut you're already sending a servant to fetch Isabel. Álvaro's eyebrows rise slightly. \"The Princess? For wedding planning?\" There's a hint of surprise in his voice—not disapproval exactly, but this is unusual. Most kings would simply decide and inform their brides.\n\n\"She should have input on her own wedding,\" you say.\n\nÁlvaro inclines his head. \"As you wish, Your Majesty. Actually... that's probably wise. The Church matters, at least, she'll understand better than either of us.\"\n\nA few minutes later, Isabel arrives, preceded by one of her Portuguese ladies-in-waiting. She looks slightly anxious—being summoned to a meeting with you and the Constable is outside her normal routine. She curtsies to you both.\n\n\"Your Majesty, you sent for me?\"\n\n\"Yes, Isabel. Come, sit. We're planning our wedding, and I want your thoughts on it.\"\n\nShe blinks in surprise, glancing between you and Álvaro as if unsure she heard correctly. \"My... my thoughts?\"\n\n\"The ceremony itself, the Church aspects,\" you clarify. \"Don Álvaro was just about to explain what Archbishop Gutiérrez has asked about.\"\n\nIsabel moves to sit where you indicate, her hands folding in her lap, but you can see she's slightly more alert now—this is territory she understands. Álvaro, after a moment's adjustment to having the Princess in a planning meeting, continues.\n\n\"The Archbishop presents several questions for Your Majesties to decide,\" Álvaro says, reading from the scroll:\n\n\"First: The ceremony's length and elaboration.\n\nOption One: Full High Mass with complete liturgy—approximately three hours. Includes multiple processions, extensive prayers, elaborate music, readings. Very traditional, very solemn.\n\nOption Two: Shortened ceremony—approximately ninety minutes. Still includes Mass and blessing but condensed. More common for noble marriages.\n\nThe Archbishop notes that given this is a royal wedding and you are a papal crusader, the full ceremony would be 'most appropriate and pleasing to God.'\"\n\nÁlvaro glances up. \"Translation: he wants the full ceremony. Three hours.\"\n\nIsabel speaks up quietly: \"In Portugal, my cousin's wedding—she married the Duke of Braganza—used the full High Mass. It was beautiful, but...\" she hesitates, \"...very long. Some of the elderly nobles became faint from standing.\"\n\n\"Second: The Nuptial Blessing and who delivers it.\n\nNormally, the Archbishop himself would perform the blessing.\n\nHowever, he asks whether you wish to request a papal legate to perform the ceremony, given your relationship with His Holiness? This would be unusual but enormously prestigious. It would require sending to Rome immediately and might delay the wedding.\"\n\nÁlvaro shakes his head slightly. \"February 15th wouldn't work if we're waiting for Rome. We'd be talking April or May.\"\n\nIsabel adds: \"Father António mentioned the papal bull spoke of a legate coming to Castile for the crusade? Perhaps he could perform the ceremony when he arrives?\"\n\n\"Third: Processions and public participation.\n\nThe Archbishop asks whether you want a public procession from the Alcázar of Toledo to the Cathedral, allowing the people to see and celebrate?\n\nOr a more private arrival—direct entry to the Cathedral?\n\nHe notes that a public procession would require significant security but would demonstrate royal accessibility and build popular support.\"\n\nÁlvaro comments: \"Public procession means crowds. Could be wonderful, could be chaotic. Your choice.\"\n\nIsabel looks nervous at the thought of crowds but says nothing.\n\n\"Fourth: The Crown Matrimonial.\n\nShould Princess Isabel be formally crowned as Queen Consort during the wedding ceremony?\n\nThis would add another thirty to forty minutes and require additional regalia.\n\nOr should crowning wait for a separate ceremony later?\n\nThe Archbishop notes that crowning during the wedding is traditional for Castilian queens.\"\n\nIsabel's eyes widen at this. \"Crowned? During the wedding?\" She looks genuinely frightened by the prospect.\n\n\"Fifth: Music and choir.\n\nThe Cathedral has an excellent choir. The Archbishop asks what music you prefer?\n\nTraditional Gregorian chant throughout?\n\nOr include some polyphonic motets (more elaborate, newer style)?\n\nHe specifically asks if there are any particular hymns or prayers you wish included.\"\n\nThis is where Isabel actually lights up slightly. \"Oh,\" she says softly. \"Music. I... I had not thought about the music.\"\n\n\"Sixth: Relics and sacred objects.\n\nThe Archbishop asks whether you wish to display your True Cross fragment and Santiago's bone during the ceremony?\n\nThis would require transporting them from Seville and housing them appropriately.\n\nOr should the ceremony use Toledo's own relics?\n\nHe notes that your relics would connect the wedding explicitly to the crusade.\"\n\nÁlvaro looks at you. \"That's a political question as much as religious.\"\n\n\"Finally: The feast afterward.\n\nThe Archbishop doesn't control this, but he asks about timing—when should the ceremony conclude to allow for the wedding feast?\n\nMorning ceremony means afternoon feast. Afternoon ceremony means evening feast.\n\nHe personally recommends morning, 'as is proper for beginning a new union with the day's first light.'\"\n\nÁlvaro sets down the scroll. \"Those are his main questions. He has about fifteen more minor ones about vestments and candle arrangements, but these are the significant decisions.\"\n\nHe looks between you and Isabel. \"Your Majesties?\"\n\nIsabel is sitting very straight, clearly trying to process all of this. She glances at you, uncertain whether she's actually supposed to give opinions or if this was just informational.\n\nWhat do you decide on each point? And do you encourage Isabel to speak freely about her preferences?"

          "text": "\"I... that is, I do have some thoughts, Your Majesty, if you truly wish to hear them?\" She glances at Álvaro as if worried she's overstepping, but the Constable simply inclines his head, giving her space to speak.\n\n\"In the convent—at Santa Clara in Coimbra—we sang every day,\" Isabel begins, her voice soft but growing steadier as she speaks about something she actually knows. \"The sisters taught us Gregorian chant, of course. It's beautiful, proper, traditional. Very... solemn.\"\n\nShe pauses, then continues with a bit more animation: \"But there was one sister—Sister Beatriz—who had been at court before taking vows, and she taught some of us the newer styles. Polyphonic motets. They're more... elaborate. Multiple voices weaving together. I found them very moving.\"\n\nShe looks at you directly now, a hint of genuine enthusiasm breaking through her usual reserve. \"There's a motet—Ave Maria by... I think an English composer? We sang it on feast days. It was so beautiful it made me cry. The voices would rise and fall, interweaving, like... like prayers ascending to heaven in harmony.\"\n\nThen she catches herself, suddenly worried she's been too forward. \"But Gregorian chant is more traditional, more proper for a royal wedding. I wouldn't want to seem frivolous or—\"\n\n\"No, no,\" you interrupt gently. \"I asked for your thoughts. Continue.\"\n\nIsabel takes a breath. \"Well... if Your Majesty permits, perhaps both? Gregorian chant for the main liturgy—the Mass itself, the most sacred parts. That's as it should be. But for certain moments...\" She's growing more confident now, thinking it through. \"Perhaps a polyphonic motet for the processional, when we enter? And another during the offering, or when we receive communion? It would be... it would be beautiful without being improper.\"\n\nShe looks down at her hands. \"And there's one specific hymn I would like, if possible. Ubi Caritas—'Where charity and love are, God is there.' We sang it at my sister's wedding in Lisbon. It reminds me of home, but it's also... it's about love and God together. It seemed fitting.\"\n\nThen, more quietly: \"Mother Superior Beatriz used to say that music is prayer made audible. That when we sing well, we're offering our voices to God. I always thought a wedding should have beautiful music, because it's a joyful thing, a sacred thing. Not just duty but celebration.\"\n\nShe glances up at you, then at Álvaro. \"But these are just my thoughts. I defer to Your Majesty's wisdom and the Archbishop's guidance. I am not...\" she searches for words, \"...I am not experienced in such grand matters.

Now I understand Martin V better:\n- He ended the Western Schism\n- From the powerful Colonna family\n- Focused on restoring Rome and papal authority\n- Opposed conciliar theory (councils over pope)\n- Practical administrator, diplomat, nepotistic\n- Supported crusades (authorized crusades against Hussites, gave indulgences for fighting Ottomans)\n- Would be 62 years old in 1430 (died Feb 1431!)\n- Actually dies very soon after this period!\n\nFor legates in this era:\n- Often cardinals or senior bishops\n- Could be \"legatus a latere\" (full powers, alter ego of pope) or \"legatus missus\" (limited mission)\n- Often Italian, sometimes learned diplomats\n- Could be controlling or helpful\n- Mixed motives common\n- Age varied widely\n\nGiven Martin V was moved by Juan's renunciation and this is a crusade against Muslims (which Martin supported), he'd likely send someone competent.

He's been in Toledo, but the Archbishop hasn't informed us of his arrival or identity.\"\n\nHis pen pauses over the parchment. \"That's... irregular.

The Archbishop will be pleased we're following protocol.\" He glances at Isabel, who has gone pale at the mention of being crowned but nods silently, accepting it as duty.\n\n\"Public procession with the banner,\" Álvaro continues, warming to the logistics. \"That's brilliant theater. Fifty crusaders in white with red crosses, the sacred banner carried through Toledo's streets, you and the Princess processing to the Cathedral—the people will love it. It shows strength, faith, and accessibility all at once.\"\n\nHe taps his quill thoughtfully. \"Transporting the banner safely from Seville to Toledo will require careful planning. That's a journey of about twelve days in winter. The reliquaries are delicate—especially the True Cross fragment. We'll need a secure wagon, covered against weather, the crusader escort you mentioned, and probably another twenty men-at-arms for additional security. The roads between here and Toledo are generally safe, but carrying such precious relics...\"\n\n\"We could also use this journey for recruitment,\" Álvaro adds. \"Fifty crusaders in formation, the banner visible at rest stops—every town between here and Toledo would see it. Word would spread.\"\n\nIsabel speaks up quietly: \"Will... will people be allowed to venerate the relics in Toledo before the wedding? If they're in the Cathedral?\"\n\nIt's a good question—and one that affects logistics.\n\nÁlvaro nods approvingly at her. \"Wise thought, Your Majesty. If we display them for public veneration, it builds enthusiasm. If we keep them solely for the wedding, it maintains their mystery and power. Either approach has merit.\"\n\nHe returns to his list. \"Remaining matters from the Archbishop's questions:\n\nFirst: Ceremony length. He wants the full three-hour High Mass. Do we agree? With the Queen's crowning added, we're looking at three and a half to four hours total. Long, but appropriately solemn.\"\n\nSecond: Timing. Morning ceremony starting at dawn—perhaps nine o'clock—means we finish early afternoon, leaving the whole evening for the wedding feast. Or afternoon ceremony starting at two o'clock means we feast in the evening. Your preference?\"\n\nHe looks between you and Isabel. \"Morning is more traditional. Afternoon is more dramatic—sunset light through the Cathedral windows during the blessing.\"\n\nIsabel offers softly: \"Morning feels... proper. Beginning our marriage with the day's first light, as the Archbishop suggested.\"\n\nÁlvaro nods. \"Morning ceremony then, unless Your Majesty objects?\"\n\n\"Now, timeline for departure from Seville,\" he continues. \"If the wedding is February 15th and the journey is twelve days, we should depart no later than February 1st—that gives us two weeks in Toledo for preparations. But honestly, I'd recommend leaving by January 25th to allow buffer time for weather delays. That's four weeks from now.\"\n\nHe looks at you seriously. \"Four weeks to finalize everything here—the crusade recruitment proclamations, the assessment teams for tax reform, appointments, treasury matters. It's tight but doable.\"\n\n\"Does Princess Isabel travel with us or separately with her Portuguese escort? Traveling together shows unity. Traveling separately allows her to move at a more comfortable pace with her ladies-in-waiting while you handle any military or political business along the route.\"\n\nIsabel looks uncertain, glancing between you and Álvaro, clearly not sure what's expected.\n\n\"And finally,\" Álvaro says, \"the invitation wording. Do we explicitly mention crusade recruitment in the invitation—'Come celebrate the royal wedding and consider pledging to the holy crusade'? Or keep it subtle and have recruitment happen organically during the festivities?\"\n\nHe sets down his quill. \"Those are the major decisions. Though I must mention...\" He hesitates, choosing words carefully. \"Your Majesty, about this papal legate. If he's been in Toledo for a week or two without announcing himself properly, that suggests either extreme caution or...\" he pauses, \"...or a particular interpretation of protocol. Some legates are easier to work with than others. We should learn who he is and what his temperament is like before we arrive. I'll send riders today to establish contact and get a sense of the man.\"\n\nThere's concern in Álvaro's voice—he clearly senses potential complications.\n\nWhat do you decide on the remaining questions?

We're talking about two hundred people minimum, probably closer to three hundred with servants and guards. That's a spectacle. Every town we pass through will see royal authority, crusade fervor, and the Portuguese alliance all at once.\"\n\nHe looks thoughtful. \"We should time our stops deliberately. Rest in significant towns—maybe Córdoba, then somewhere in La Mancha, then approach Toledo. Give people time to gather and see the procession. Turn the journey into a mobile recruitment campaign.\"\n\n\"Diego maintaining the ledger at all times,\" Álvaro nods approvingly. \"He's meticulous. But Your Majesty, I recommend we also have a second scribe copying everything—redundancy in case something happens to the primary ledger. These records are too important.\"\n\nHe checks his notes. \"Remaining questions:\n\nFirst: The invitation wording. Should it explicitly mention crusade recruitment—'Following the sacred ceremony, those moved by faith may pledge themselves to the crusade against Granada'—or keep it understated? Explicit mention ensures nobles come prepared to consider it. Subtle approach lets it seem more spontaneous, less like we're demanding commitments.\"\n\nSecond: While the relics are in Toledo before the wedding, do we allow public veneration? Opening the Cathedral for common people to pray before the True Cross would build enormous goodwill, but increases security concerns. Keeping them secured until the ceremony maintains their sacred mystery.\"\n\nThird: The legate. We need to send riders immediately to Toledo to make formal contact. Should the letter be from you directly, or should I handle it as Constable? Some legates prefer royal protocol, others prefer working through intermediaries first.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds more seriously: \"Your Majesty, if we're departing in one week, I need to accelerate several critical matters:\n\nImmediate tasks for the next seven days:\n\nDraft and send wedding invitations TODAY—riders need to depart tomorrow at dawn\n\nFinalize the crusade recruitment proclamation that we've been drafting\n\nIssue appointments for the assessor teams you've been planning for tax reform\n\nOrganize the departure logistics—three hundred people, wagons, supplies for twelve days\n\nBrief Diego on his role at the wedding\n\nContact the legate in Toledo\n\nPrepare the relics for transport\n\nSelect which crusaders travel with us (and which stay to continue recruitment here)\n\nDraft letters to nobles along our route announcing our passage—courtesy and recruitment\n\nFinancial arrangements—the treasury needs gold for the journey and wedding expenses\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"I can do this. But I'll need your decisions rapidly when I bring matters to you over the next week. No delays, no extended deliberations. Agreed?\"\n\nThen he glances at Isabel. \"Your Majesty,\" he addresses her, \"you'll need to prepare your household for departure as well. Portuguese ladies, servants, your confessor. One week is very little time. Can your people be ready?\"\n\nIsabel straightens, seeming to gather herself. \"Yes, Don Álvaro. We will be ready. I may not understand politics or military matters, but I know how to pack a household.\" There's a hint of dry humor in her tone—perhaps the first joke she's made.\n\nÁlvaro actually smiles. \"Excellent. Then we have our plan.\"\n\nHe stands, preparing to execute everything. \"Anything else, Your Majesty? Any other instructions before I unleash a week of organized chaos?\"\n\nWhat else do you want to address? And how do you answer his three remaining questions about invitation wording, public veneration, and contacting the legate?"

Fernán, Sir Thomas, García, and Fray Hernando travel with you. Diego as well, obviously, for the ledger. Fifty crusaders total.\"\n\nHe nods approvingly. \"Rodrigo is a good choice to leave in command here. He has the respect of the men, knows the crusade inside and out. He can continue training and preliminary recruitment while we're gone.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, quill poised, \"before I can finalize everything and set this in motion, I still need your decisions on three specific points:\n\nOne: The invitation wording. Do we explicitly state 'Following the ceremony, those moved by faith may pledge to the holy crusade' or leave recruitment unmentioned in the formal invitation and handle it organically during the festivities?\"\n\nTwo: Once the relics are in Toledo Cathedral before the wedding—that's potentially two weeks they're there—do we open the Cathedral for public veneration? Allowing common people to pray before the True Cross builds enormous goodwill but means constant security and crowds. Or do we keep them secured until the ceremony?\"\n\nThree: Making contact with the papal legate in Toledo. Should my letter state that you, the King, wish to make his formal acquaintance upon arrival? Or should I write as Constable to establish preliminary contact and assess his temperament first, before you meet him directly?\"\n\nHe looks at you expectantly. \"Once you decide these three points, I can set everything in motion immediately. I'll have riders departing by dawn tomorrow with invitations to every major noble house in Castile.\"\n\nIsabel, still sitting nearby, adds quietly: \"If I may... on the second question about the relics? In Portugal, when holy relics visited a city, the people lined up for days to venerate them. It meant everything to them. My mother said showing the people sacred things reminds them why they serve the crown—not from fear, but from faith.\"\n\nShe glances at you, uncertain if she's overstepped by offering an opinion. \"But I defer to Your Majesty's wisdom on security concerns.\"\n\nWhat are your decisions on these three questions?"

We'll need to construct screening—perhaps velvet drapes that can be pulled back at the right moment during the liturgy? The Archbishop will want to coordinate that precisely. And yes, keeping the banner displayed afterward for public veneration is wise—gives common people their moment while maintaining the relics' special sanctity for the ceremony itself.\"\n\nHe makes a final note. \"Letter to the legate expressing your anticipation of meeting him personally and ensuring his hospitality. I'll write it formally—respectful of his office, welcoming, but clearly indicating you are the king and he is your guest. Some legates need that gentle reminder.\"\n\nÁlvaro sets down his quill and looks at you directly. \"That's everything I need. I can begin immediately.\"\n\nHe stands, gathering his scrolls. \"Your Majesty, for the next seven days, expect me to appear frequently with documents requiring your signature, decisions on details, and status reports. It's going to be intense.\"\n\nHe bows to you, then—surprisingly—bows to Isabel as well. \"Your Majesties, if you'll excuse me, I have approximately two hundred tasks that need to begin simultaneously.\"\n\nAs he heads for the door, he pauses and turns back. \"Your Majesty? This is good work. A royal wedding, a crusade recruitment event, a demonstration of strength and piety combined. If we execute this well, you'll have both a queen and an army by March.\"\n\nHe grins briefly. \"Now I just need to make it all happen in seven days.\"\n\nHe departs, already calling for scribes and messengers in the corridor outside.\n\nIsabel sits quietly for a moment after Álvaro leaves, processing everything that just transpired. Finally, she speaks softly: \"That was... a great deal of information. Don Álvaro is very efficient.\"\n\nShe looks at you. \"One week until we depart. I should begin preparations with my ladies. Unless...\" she hesitates, \"...unless Your Majesty requires anything else?\"\n\nThere's something slightly different in her demeanor now—having been included in planning discussions, having her opinion on the relics acknowledged, she seems a fraction less uncertain than before.\n\nThe next seven days will be busy. Do you want to:\n\nFast-forward through the week with a summary of preparations?\n\nFocus on any specific events during the preparation week (meeting someone, handling a problem, another moment with Isabel)?\n\nSkip directly to the departure from Seville?\n\nSomething else?\n\nAlso, what time of day is it currently? Do you do anything else this evening, or retire for the night?"

          "text": "The Week of Preparations\n\nSeville, Late December 1430\n\nThe week passes in controlled chaos.\n\nRodrigo's Command\n\nYou find Rodrigo in the training yard the morning after your meeting with Álvaro, overseeing sword drills. When you pull him aside, his weathered face shows both pride and concern.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I'm honored by your trust,\" he says when you explain he'll remain as your representative in Seville. \"But I'll confess—accepting pledges without the banner present feels... incomplete. Like taking vows without the presence of God.\"\n\n\"Which is why they're preliminary,\" you explain. \"You assess them, train them, prepare them. But they don't become true crusaders until they swear before the banner when we return. Think of it as preparing candidates for knighthood—you're determining who's worthy.\"\n\nRodrigo nods slowly, understanding. Over the next days, you ensure he has everything: authority to recruit, funds for basic equipment, space in the Alcázar for training, access to Diego's ledger system so he can maintain records. You introduce him formally to the nobles who remain in Seville, establishing his authority as your voice in military matters.\n\n\"The campaign begins in April,\" you remind him on the third day as you review his preparations. \"That gives you three months to find good men, weed out the unsuitable, and have them ready. When we return with the banner in March, we should be able to accept fifty, maybe a hundred new crusaders in rapid succession.\"\n\n\"Understood, Your Majesty.\" Rodrigo hesitates, then adds: \"Take care of the banner. And the men. They're... they're my brothers, even if we're separating.\"\n\nIntroducing Isabel\n\nThe formal visits to Seville's important figures become a pattern. You quickly learn that Isabel functions best when you take clear charge—she follows your lead naturally, her anxiety diminishing when she doesn't have to navigate uncertain social situations alone.\n\nAt the house of Don Pedro de Zúñiga, one of Seville's most influential nobles, you introduce her: \"The Princess Isabel of Portugal, my betrothed, soon to be your queen.\"\n\nIsabel curtsies perfectly, murmurs appropriate greetings in her carefully pronounced Castilian, then stands slightly behind and to your side while you discuss matters with Don Pedro. She listens attentively but doesn't speak unless directly addressed. When the nobleman's wife draws her aside to discuss wedding preparations, you see relief flash across Isabel's face—feminine conversation, familiar territory.\n\nAt the cathedral, attending Mass together becomes a daily ritual. The first morning, Isabel kneels beside you in the royal pew, her prayer book open, her lips moving in silent devotion. The service is in Latin, which she follows easily—this is her comfort zone, the language of God and liturgy.\n\nAfterward, the Archbishop introduces her to the assembled clergy. You stand at her side, your hand lightly on her elbow, a subtle gesture of support and authority. She speaks briefly—thanking them for welcoming her, expressing hope for their prayers—then defers back to you.\n\n\"You're very good at this,\" she says quietly as you walk back through the cathedral gardens. \"At knowing what to say, how to act. I feel like I'm always one wrong word away from embarrassment.\"\n\n\"You're doing well,\" you assure her. \"Better than you think. People don't expect you to be a seasoned courtier—they expect you to be pious, proper, and gracious. Which you are.\"\n\nShe glances at you with something like cautious gratitude. \"It helps when you're there. When I know you'll speak if I stumble.\"\n\nOver the week, you introduce her to everyone who matters: the city's merchant princes, the commanders of the garrison, Álvaro's key administrators, the Portuguese merchants who trade through Seville's port. Each time, the pattern repeats—you lead, she follows, she relaxes into her role as your companion rather than trying to navigate alone.\n\nBy week's end, she's greeting people with slightly more confidence, her Castilian flowing more naturally. She's learning to read your cues—when you turn to her, she knows to speak; when you continue, she knows to remain silent. It's not equality or partnership in governance, but it's functional. A king and his proper queen.\n\nThe Crusader Farewell\n\nThe hardest moment comes on the final evening before departure.\n\nYou gather all 151 crusaders in the Alcázar's great courtyard—the same space where you first clasped hands with Marco, where Brother Guillem wept, where the brotherhood was forged. Torches burn along the walls, casting dancing shadows. The white banner with its red cross hangs above you, catching the firelight.\n\nOne hundred and one men will remain with Rodrigo. Fifty will travel with you to Toledo.\n\nThe silence is heavy as you stand before them. These men went to Rome with you. They witnessed your renunciation. They received their crosses from your hand. They are yours in a way no other soldiers will ever be—the first crusaders, the foundation.\n\n\"Brothers,\" you begin, and the word carries weight. \"For the first time since we clasped hands before God, we must separate. Not because of failure or division, but because our cause grows too large for us all to remain in one place.\"\n\nYou gesture to Rodrigo. \"Captain Rodrigo Manrique remains as my voice in Seville. Those of you who stay with him have a sacred duty: prepare the next wave of crusaders. Train them. Test them. Make them worthy to stand beside you when we return with the banner in March.\"\n\nThen you turn to the fifty selected to travel with you. \"Those who come to Toledo carry the banner itself. You are not merely guards or escort—you are witnesses. Every town we pass, every noble who sees us, every common person who glimpses the sacred cross—they will see YOU. The first crusaders. The example.\"\n\nFernán Álvarez steps forward. \"Your Majesty, the men wish to say something.\"\n\nHe nods to Marco Tornesi, the Italian who was first to take the oath. Marco's weathered crusader face is tight with emotion.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Marco says, his voice thick with accent and feeling. \"We who go—we carry the honor. But we who stay—we feel it most. To watch the banner leave without us...\" He struggles. \"We are brothers. Brothers should not be divided.\"\n\nBrother Guillem speaks next, tears already on his weathered cheeks. \"I stay with Captain Rodrigo. It is right—I am needed to help test new men's faith. But my heart goes with the banner. With you. With...\" he gestures helplessly at the fifty selected to travel, \"...with them.\"\n\nYou see it then—the cost of success. The brotherhood you forged is so strong that splitting it hurts like severing flesh.\n\n\"The banner will return,\" you say firmly. \"In three months, we reunite. Then we march—all of us—to Granada. This separation is temporary. The brotherhood is eternal.\"\n\nYou draw your father's sword—Non Nobis Domine—and hold it high. \"Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Thy name give glory. Whether in Seville or Toledo, whether with the banner or preparing the way, we serve the same cause. We are one brotherhood, divided only in body, never in spirit.\"\n\nThe men kneel as one—all 151, those staying and those going.\n\nFray Hernando steps forward and leads them in prayer: \"Deus vult! Deus vult! Deus vult!\" God wills it. The ancient cry of crusaders echoes off the courtyard walls.\n\nWhen they rise, there are embraces—awkward, fierce, emotional. Men who have shared tents and meals and prayers for months saying farewell. Some of those staying press small tokens into the hands of those going: a carved wooden cross, a saint's medal, a prayer written on folded parchment.\n\n\"Keep the banner safe,\" Andrea Vescovi says to Sir Thomas, gripping his arm. \"You carry our soul with you.\"\n\n\"We'll bring it back worthy of you,\" Thomas replies, his English-accented Spanish solemn.\n\nRodrigo clasps your hand last. \"Bring them back, Your Majesty. All fifty. And the banner.\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\nDeparture Morning\n\nDecember 28th, 1430 – Dawn\n\nThe procession assembles in the pre-dawn darkness. Three hundred people: fifty crusaders in white surcoats with red crosses, Isabel's Portuguese retinue of thirty, Álvaro's administrators, Diego with his precious ledgers wrapped in oiled leather, servants, guards, wagons carrying supplies and the precious relics in their covered, cushioned containers.\n\nThe banner itself travels on a special wagon—standing upright in a socket, visible but protected by a canvas cover that can be removed when you enter towns.\n\nIsabel emerges from the Alcázar in traveling clothes—practical dark wool, a fur-lined cloak against December cold, her hair properly covered. Her Portuguese ladies cluster around her, chattering nervously in Portuguese about the journey ahead.\n\nYou mount your horse. Fernán and Sir Thomas flank you. Fray Hernando rides nearby, his weathered face serene. García de Medina checks the crusaders' formation one final time.\n\nRodrigo and the one hundred and one remaining crusaders stand in formation to see you off. As you pass, they salute—fists over hearts, the gesture you've made your own.\n\nThe gates of Seville open. The December sun breaks over the eastern horizon, painting the sky gold and red.\n\nYou ride forward, the banner following behind you, three hundred souls in your wake.\n\nIsabel rides in a covered wagon for now—it will be days before she's comfortable enough to ride openly through crowds. You catch a glimpse of her pale face through the wagon's opening, watching you lead from the front.\n\nThe crusade is moving.\n\nStatus Summary:\n\nDate: December 28, 1430, Dawn\n\nLocation: Departing Seville for Toledo (12-day journey)\n\nTraveling Party: ~300 people total\n50 crusaders (Fernán, Sir Thomas, García, and 47 others)\n\nKing Juan II\n\nPrincess Isabel + 30 Portuguese retinue\n\nFray Hernando\n\nÁlvaro de Luna + administrators\n\nDiego de Luna (record keeper)\n\nServants, guards, supply wagons\n\nSacred relics and banner (covered)\n\nRemaining in Seville: 101 crusaders under Rodrigo Manrique\n\nExpected Arrival in Toledo: Mid-January\n\nWedding Date: February 15, 1431\n\nThe journey to Toledo awaits.

The December rains that should turn roads to mud never come. Instead, crisp clear mornings follow cold nights, and the winter sun—pale but present—lights your path each day. Álvaro remarks on the third day that you're making exceptional time, and Fray Hernando simply smiles and says, \"God blesses His own work.\"\n\nYou establish a pattern at each significant town:\n\nThe procession enters at midday when possible—maximum visibility. First come twenty-five crusaders in formation, white surcoats with red crosses blazing against the winter landscape. Then you, mounted, dressed entirely in white—a figure that draws gasps from watching crowds. Behind you, the wagon carrying the banner, the pure white silk visible even covered. More crusaders follow, then Isabel's covered wagon, then the rest of your company.\n\nAt the town center, the banner is unveiled.\n\nÉcija: The First Test\n\nDecember 30th, Evening\n\nÉcija is the first major town, three days out from Seville. You send a rider ahead at dawn announcing your arrival, and by the time your procession enters at noon, the entire town seems to have gathered.\n\nThe plaza is packed. When García orders the banner unveiled—fifty crusaders forming a protective circle around it—the crowd surges forward. Women cry out. Men drop to their knees. The pure white silk catches the winter sun and seems almost to glow.\n\n\"Es un milagro,\" someone shouts. It's a miracle.\n\nYou dismount and stand before the banner. The crowd falls silent—thousands of people, utterly still.\n\n\"People of Écija,\" your voice carries across the plaza. \"This banner was blessed by His Holiness Pope Martin V in Rome. It will lead the crusade against Granada. Those who fight under it fight for Christ Himself. Those who give to support it give to God's own cause.\"\n\nA local priest—elderly, bent—pushes through the crowd and kneels before the banner, weeping openly. \"I have prayed for this day,\" he says, his voice breaking. \"For forty years I have prayed that Castile would finish what our fathers began. Now I see it with my own eyes before I die.\"\n\nThe crowd erupts. Not in cheers exactly, but in something deeper—a kind of collective exhalation, as if the town has been holding its breath for generations.\n\nThat evening, twelve men—farmers, craftsmen, one minor knight—approach Fernán formally. \"We wish to pledge ourselves to the crusade.\"\n\nFernán directs them to you. You explain the process carefully: preliminary pledge now, formal oath before the banner when it returns to Seville, then training with Rodrigo until the campaign begins in April.\n\n\"We understand, Your Majesty,\" the knight says. He's perhaps thirty, scarred, capable-looking. \"But I want my name written down. I want God to know I answered the call.\"\n\nDiego inscribes their names in his ledger by candlelight. The first recruits of the journey.\n\nCarmona: Isabel Emerges\n\nJanuary 1st, 1431\n\nThe New Year finds you in Carmona, a fortified town overlooking the Corbones valley. The weather continues clear and cold—some locals mutter about it being unnatural, but most see it as divine favor.\n\nSomething shifts with Isabel here.\n\nYou're preparing for the banner display when she emerges from her covered wagon—not to climb back in after the procession ends, but to stand beside you. She's still in her traveling clothes, nothing elaborate, but she stands in the open air before hundreds of watching people.\n\n\"I should be here,\" she says quietly when you glance at her. \"For this. They should see their future queen supports the crusade.\"\n\nIt's not a grand gesture—she doesn't speak or wave. She simply stands at your side, hands folded, head properly covered, watching as the banner is unveiled. But the crowd notices. Women especially—they see the Portuguese princess choosing to stand in the cold beside her king, participating in this sacred moment rather than hiding in aristocratic comfort.\n\nA noblewoman approaches after—Doña Beatriz de Guzmán, whose husband holds lands nearby. \"Your Majesty,\" she says to Isabel, \"you honor us with your presence. And you honor the crusade. A queen who stands with her king in holy work—that is blessed.\"\n\nIsabel colors but manages a graceful response: \"The crusade is God's work. How could I not stand with it?\"\n\nThat evening, three more men pledge, but also—something new—two noblewomen donate gold. \"For the crusade,\" one says. \"So our sons and husbands fight with proper equipment.\"\n\nThe women's donations total 300 florins. Small by noble standards, but significant because it shows the crusade appealing to all—not just warriors.\n\nThe Route North: Growing Momentum\n\nJanuary 2nd-4th\n\nThe days blur into rhythm. Each town brings crowds, tears, pledges. The banner never loses its power—if anything, the effect grows stronger as word spreads ahead of you.\n\nAt Palma del Río: Eight pledges, including a father and two sons.\n\nAt Castro del Río: A local lord rides out to meet you, escorts you into town personally, pledges his own participation when the campaign begins. \"I'm too old to fight the whole war,\" he says—he's perhaps fifty-five—\"but I can ride for one season. Let me die serving God rather than rotting on my estate.\"\n\nAt Baena: The crowd is so large you have to display the banner outside the town walls. Fifteen pledges, and a wealthy merchant offers to provision twenty crusaders for the entire campaign season. \"My grandfather fought at Antequera,\" he explains. \"Let me honor his memory.\"\n\nThe crusaders maintain perfect discipline throughout. They guard the banner in shifts, never fewer than twelve men present. When you stop for the night, they establish a perimeter around the relic wagon. They are stone-faced and professional during displays, but in camp at night you hear them singing—low, solemn hymns that drift through the cold air.\n\nIsabel begins riding openly by day four. Not all day—she still retreats to the wagon when tired—but for hours at a time she rides sidesaddle beside her Portuguese ladies, visible to the crowds. The people love it. They call out blessings: \"Dios guarde a la princesa!\" God keep the princess.\n\n\"I'm getting better at this,\" she tells you one evening as the camp settles. \"At being... seen. In Portugal I was always hidden away. Here, people seem to want to see their rulers.\"\n\n\"They want to know you're real,\" you reply. \"That you care about them.\"\n\n\"I'm learning to care,\" she says thoughtfully. \"Or perhaps to show that I do. When I see them kneeling before the banner, weeping... these people have such faith. It would be wrong to hide from them.\"\n\nAndújar: The Nobleman's Sons\n\nJanuary 5th\n\nAndújar sits on the Guadalquivir, a prosperous town with connections to nobles throughout the region. When you arrive, Don Rodrigo de Orozco—a knight of middling importance, holder of three villages—greets you formally.\n\n\"Your Majesty, my house is at your disposal,\" he says. \"But I have a request.\"\n\nHe has four sons, ages sixteen to twenty-three. All trained in arms, all healthy. \"Your Majesty, I wish to pledge two of my sons to your crusade. Let them prove themselves in God's service. Let them stand with your banner.\"\n\nIt's a significant gesture—nobles typically send younger sons to war, keeping heirs safe. But Orozco is offering two out of four, showing genuine commitment.\n\nYou accept formally. The two young men—Pedro and Miguel—kneel before the banner that evening. They're nervous, excited, trying to hide both. You explain the process: their names recorded now, formal oath when the banner returns to Seville, training with Rodrigo, campaign beginning in April.\n\n\"We'll be ready, Your Majesty,\" Pedro says, the elder of the two. \"We've been training for this our whole lives.\"\n\nAfter they leave, Álvaro remarks: \"That's what we needed. Nobles' sons. Real names from real families. When other houses see that Orozco sent two sons, they'll feel pressure to match it.\"\n\nBy morning, three more local knights have pledged sons. The competition has begun.\n\nFinal Approach: Toledo in Sight\n\nJanuary 6th-7th\n\nThe final two days, you know word has raced ahead of you. Riders from each town have carried news: \"The king comes with his crusade banner. The crowds are massive. The weather holds like a blessing.\"\n\nOn January 6th—the Feast of Epiphany—you camp within sight of Toledo's towers. The city sits on its rocky hill, the Tagus River curving around it, walls and spires catching the late afternoon sun. It's one of the most beautiful sights in Castile, and more than that—it's the ancient Visigothic capital, the spiritual heart of Christian Spain.\n\nThat evening, a delegation arrives from Toledo: representatives of the Archbishop, members of the city council, and—surprisingly—a formal representative from the papal legate.\n\nThe legate's man is a middle-aged priest with the careful manner of a career bureaucrat. He bows properly. \"Your Majesty, His Eminence Cardinal Domenico Capranica, Papal Legate to Castile, welcomes you to Toledo and looks forward to making your acquaintance. He has prepared appropriate lodgings in the Archbishop's palace and wishes to arrange a formal audience at your earliest convenience.\"\n\nSo now you have a name: Cardinal Domenico Capranica.\n\nÁlvaro, standing beside you, barely conceals a grimace. You'll learn why later.\n\nThe Archbishop's representative is more effusive: \"Your Majesty, the city rejoices at your coming! Word of your journey has preceded you—the crowds, the pledges, the miracles! All Toledo awaits your arrival tomorrow!\"\n\nYou decide to enter Toledo on January 7th at midday—maximum visibility, good light, giving the city time to prepare.\n\nEntry into Toledo\n\nJanuary 7th, 1431 - Midday\n\nThe final approach is unlike anything you've experienced.\n\nThe roads leading to Toledo are lined with people—not just from the city but from surrounding villages. Thousands. They've been gathering since dawn. Many hold makeshift crosses, prayer beads, children on shoulders.\n\nWhen your procession comes into view—the crusaders in white, you in white, the banner wagon visible—the crowd erupts in shouts and prayers. \"Dios vult! Dios vult!\" Some chant it. Others just weep.\n\nYou ride at walking pace, giving people time to see. Isabel rides openly now, flanked by her Portuguese ladies. She's pale but composed, acknowledging the crowds with small nods. Someone throws flowers—roses, in January, impossibly—and they land near her horse. A Portuguese lady scoops them up, hands them to Isabel, who clutches them like a talisman.\n\nThe banner is unveiled for the final approach. Fifty crusaders surround it in perfect formation, García shouting cadence to keep them in step. The pure white silk ripples in the winter breeze, and the crowd surges closer—held back only by city guards who've formed a corridor.\n\n\"This is extraordinary,\" Álvaro murmurs, riding beside you. \"I've seen royal entries. This is... this is something else.\"\n\nAt Toledo's gates, the Archbishop waits in full regalia—Gutiérrez Álvarez de Toledo, an elderly man with sharp eyes and magnificent vestments. The city council stands with him, nobles in formal dress, clergy in ranks.\n\nAnd there, slightly to one side—a figure in cardinal's red: Cardinal Domenico Capranica.\n\nHe's perhaps sixty-two, thin, with a scholar's stoop and a bureaucrat's careful expression. He bows appropriately as you approach—correct protocol, no more, no less.\n\nThe Archbishop spreads his arms: \"Your Majesty! King Juan II of Castile! Toledo welcomes you and your sacred crusade! Welcome home to the heart of Spain!\"\n\nThe crowd roars.\n\nYou dismount before the Archbishop, kneel briefly for his blessing, then rise and turn to face the thousands watching.\n\n\"People of Toledo,\" your voice carries. \"I come bearing the banner blessed by His Holiness the Pope. I come to wed a princess who will be your queen. And I come to prepare the crusade that will finish the Reconquista your ancestors began. With God's help, we will see Granada fall!\"\n\nThe roar is deafening. People are weeping, cheering, praying. The Archbishop has tears in his eyes. Even the cardinal's careful expression cracks slightly—perhaps surprise at the sheer intensity of popular response.\n\nYou process through Toledo's streets—a route carefully planned to show maximum visibility. The banner wagon moves slowly, crusaders maintaining formation despite the pressing crowds. At every corner, more people. Every balcony crowded. Flowers and prayers rain down.\n\nIsabel handles it remarkably. She waves—small, proper gestures—and the women in the crowd respond with enthusiasm. \"La princesa! La princesa portuguesa!\" Someone starts singing, and suddenly hundreds join: a hymn to the Virgin, impromptu but beautiful.\n\nBy the time you reach the Archbishop's palace and the royal Alcázar compound, it's late afternoon. The crowd remains outside, celebrating spontaneously. You can hear them through the palace walls—singing, praying, rejoicing.\n\nFirst Evening in Toledo\n\nJanuary 7th, Evening\n\nIn the relative quiet of the royal chambers, Álvaro briefs you rapidly.\n\n\"Recruitment tally from the journey,\" he says, reading from Diego's notes. \"Ninety-three preliminary pledges. Twelve are nobles or nobles' sons—real names from real families. The rest are commoners, but good quality. Former soldiers, younger sons with some training, a few craftsmen who can afford their own equipment. Rodrigo will assess them when we return, but Diego believes at least seventy will pass training.\"\n\n\"And the donations?\"\n\n\"Eight hundred florins in gold and goods. The two noblewomen in Carmona, the merchant in Baena, smaller contributions from others. Plus three offers of provision—men pledging to supply crusaders for the campaign season.\"\n\nÁlvaro grins. \"Your Majesty, that journey was... I've never seen anything like it. The weather alone—eleven days of clear skies in January? People are calling it a miracle. The banner's effect on crowds? Beyond anything I anticipated. And the Princess...\" He actually looks impressed. \"She found her courage. By the end she was riding openly, accepting flowers. The people love her for it.\"\n\nThen his expression darkens. \"Now. Cardinal Capranica.\"\n\nHe pulls out a scroll—information gathered from his contacts. \"Domenico Capranica. Age sixty-two. Career papal administrator, served under three popes. Brilliant with canon law and ecclesiastical procedure. Obsessed with proper protocol. Known for writing twenty-page memoranda about minor jurisdictional questions. Martin V sent him because he's reliable and thorough, but...\" Álvaro grimaces, \"...he's going to be difficult.\"\n\n\"How difficult?\"\n\n\"He's been in Toledo nearly three weeks. The Archbishop only informed us a week ago because Capranica spent the first two weeks establishing his credentials, verifying his documents, ensuring proper protocol was followed for his lodging. He hasn't even formally presented himself to the city yet—he's been drafting the procedures for how such a presentation should occur.\"\n\nÁlvaro looks at you seriously. \"He brought forty-five thousand florins, extensive papal documents, letters of authority to every bishop in Spain, and enough administrative staff to run a small kingdom. But he's going to require proper procedure for everything. Every expenditure will need documentation. Every decision will need canonical justification. He's the kind of man who can turn a five-minute conversation into a three-hour discussion of precedent.\"\n\n\"Can we work with him?\"\n\n\"We'll have to. He's the Pope's representative. But Your Majesty...\" Álvaro chooses words carefully. \"Don't expect him to be a partner like I am. Expect him to be an administrator who ensures everything is done correctly according to canon law and papal procedure. Which means slowly.\"\n\nA servant interrupts: \"Your Majesty, Cardinal Capranica requests an audience at your earliest convenience. He suggests tomorrow morning, after Lauds, in the Archbishop's chapter house, with proper witnesses present and a notary to record the proceedings.\"\n\nÁlvaro rolls his eyes. \"Of course he does.\"\n\nStatus Summary:\n\nDate: January 7, 1431, Evening\n\nLocation: Royal Alcázar, Toledo\n\nJourney Results:\n93 preliminary crusade pledges (12 nobles/sons, 81 commoners)\n\n800 florins in donations\n\nEnormous popular enthusiasm across route\n\nIsabel gained significant confidence\n\nWeather held perfectly (11 days total)\n\nIn Toledo:\nCardinal Domenico Capranica present (age 62, bureaucratic type)\n\nBrought 45,000 florins and extensive papal documents\n\nWill officiate wedding (with extensive procedure)\n\nArchbishop Gutiérrez supportive but subordinate to legate\n\nCity wildly enthusiastic about crusade\n\nWedding: February 15th (38 days away)\n\nWhat do you do next?"

          "text": "Evening with Isabel\n\nRoyal Alcázar, Toledo - January 7th, Evening\n\nYou find Isabel in the chambers that have been prepared for her—the Queen's apartments in Toledo's Alcázar, rooms that haven't housed a queen since your mother died when you were a child. The Portuguese ladies are unpacking trunks, hanging gowns, arranging prayer books and personal items. The chaos of arrival fills the space.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Isabel rises immediately when you enter, smoothing her traveling dress. She looks tired but something in her bearing is different from the anxious girl who arrived in Seville. The journey changed her.\n\n\"Come,\" you say, \"let me show you around. These will be your rooms, and you should know how to navigate them.\"\n\nYou walk her through the apartments—the solar with its view of the Tagus valley, the private chapel (she brightens immediately at seeing this), the bedchamber, the adjoining rooms for her ladies. The palace is older than Seville's Alcázar, more austere but beautiful in its way, with Moorish-influenced arches and tile work mixed with Christian fortification.\n\n\"It's lovely,\" Isabel says, running her hand along a carved window frame. \"Different from Portugal, but... I think I could be happy here.\" She pauses. \"The journey helped. Seeing the people, the towns. Castile feels less foreign now.\"\n\n\"You did well on the journey,\" you tell her. \"Riding openly those last days—the people loved seeing you.\"\n\nShe colors slightly. \"I was terrified at first. But then I thought... they're not there to judge me. They're there because they have faith. In God, in the crusade, in...\" she hesitates, \"...in you. The least I could do was let them see I stand with you in it.\"\n\nOnce her ladies have the apartments somewhat organized, you suggest wine in the solar. The servants bring a good Rioja and leave you with relative privacy—Isabel's Portuguese duenna sits in the corner for propriety, but far enough to give the illusion of private conversation.\n\nThe winter sun is setting over Toledo, painting the sky orange and purple through the western windows.\n\n\"So,\" you say, settling into a cushioned seat near the brazier. \"Thirty-eight days until our wedding. Have you thought more about what you want?\"\n\nIsabel sips her wine carefully. \"I've thought about little else, if I'm honest. Though after today—after that entrance into the city—I'm wondering if my thoughts matter much. It's going to be enormous regardless of what I want.\"\n\n\"The ceremony itself can still be yours,\" you say. \"We've decided the important parts—the full High Mass, the morning timing, your Portuguese dress, the music you suggested. What else?\"\n\nShe's quiet for a moment, gathering her thoughts. \"The crowning frightens me,\" she admits. \"Being crowned during the ceremony, in front of thousands... Doña Catalina told me in Seville that becoming queen means carrying the weight of every soul in the kingdom in your prayers. That when I'm crowned, I'll be responsible before God for all of Castile.\"\n\n\"That's a heavy weight to put on anyone,\" you say gently.\n\n\"But it's true, isn't it?\" She looks at you directly. \"Queens are supposed to pray for the kingdom, for heirs, for peace, for their husbands' souls. That's what Mother Superior Beatriz taught me. That's what my own mother did in Portugal—she spent hours every day in chapel, praying for my father, for Portugal, for all of us.\"\n\nShe takes another sip of wine, her fingers tight on the cup. \"I want to do that well. To be a good queen in that way, even if I don't understand taxes or military campaigns. But the crowning itself... standing there while the Archbishop places the crown, thousands watching, knowing they're all expecting something from me...\" She trails off.\n\n\"They're expecting you to be faithful,\" you say. \"Which you are. They're expecting you to stand beside your king. Which you've already shown you will. The rest—the prayers, the duty, the carrying the weight—that comes with time. You don't have to be perfect on February 15th.\"\n\n\"No,\" she agrees quietly. \"Just... present. Visible. Willing.\" She manages a small smile. \"I can do that. I did it on the journey, after all. And I had your Portuguese dress promise to hold onto—wearing Mama's dress makes me feel less alone in all of this.\"\n\nYou talk through other details: the procession route (she's nervous but resigned), the feast afterward (overwhelming but unavoidable), where her family will sit in the cathedral (her Portuguese ladies have strong opinions about precedence).\n\n\"I wish my mother could be here,\" Isabel says softly, staring into her wine cup. \"She would know exactly what to say, how to prepare me for all of this. My ladies try, but it's not the same.\"\n\n\"You can write to her after the wedding,\" you suggest. \"Tell her everything.\"\n\n\"I will.\" She looks up. \"Will you... will you be patient with me? That night, I mean. After the ceremony. I know what's expected, what must happen for the marriage to be valid and for heirs, but I...\" She's blushing furiously now. \"Father António explained the basics, but I'm still not entirely sure I understand, and I'm frightened of doing something wrong or disappointing you or—\"\n\n\"Isabel,\" you interrupt gently. \"We'll manage. I'll be patient.\"\n\nShe nods, clearly relieved to have said it and have it acknowledged. \"Thank you.\"\n\nThe conversation shifts to lighter matters—the food at tomorrow's formal dinner, whether Toledo's winter is colder than Seville's, her Portuguese ladies' reactions to Castilian customs. The wine relaxes her further, and by the time the light has fully faded she's almost comfortable, curled in her seat with her cup, talking about small things.\n\n\"This is nice,\" she says eventually. \"Just... talking. Like normal people rather than king and princess planning grand events.\"\n\n\"We are normal people,\" you point out. \"We just happen to have crowns.\"\n\nShe laughs—a genuine laugh, quiet but real. \"Speak for yourself, Your Majesty. I'm still trying to convince myself I belong in all of this.\"\n\n\"You rode through five towns with thousands cheering for you. You belong.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\" She finishes her wine. \"Or perhaps I'm just learning to pretend convincingly.\" But there's warmth in her voice, a kind of tentative contentment.\n\nYou leave her to her ladies and her rest. Tomorrow begins the formal protocols of Toledo, starting with the papal legate.\n\nMeeting Cardinal Capranica\n\nArchbishop's Palace, Toledo - January 8th, Morning\n\nThe chapter house is cold despite braziers in the corners. Cardinal Domenico Capranica has arranged it like a formal audience: a table at the far end with three chairs (for himself, the Archbishop, and his senior secretary), witnesses standing along the walls (eight clergy, all watching with careful eyes), and two notaries at side desks with parchment, ink, and seals ready.\n\nYou enter with Álvaro. The Cardinal rises—not quickly, but with measured dignity—and bows. It's a proper bow, ecclesiastically correct, showing respect for royal authority while maintaining his own dignity as papal representative.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" his voice is dry, precise, with an Italian accent. \"We are honored by your presence. Please, be seated.\"\n\nHe gestures to chairs that have been placed before his table—deliberately positioned as supplicants rather than equals. Álvaro notices immediately; you see his jaw tighten slightly.\n\nYou remain standing.\n\n\"Your Eminence,\" you say pleasantly. \"We are grateful for your presence in Toledo and for the Holy Father's commitment to this crusade. Perhaps we might speak more... collegially? As partners in God's work rather than in formal audience?\"\n\nIt's a gentle challenge. Capranica's eyes sharpen slightly—he's recognized the move.\n\n\"Of course, Your Majesty.\" He gestures, and servants quickly rearrange chairs into a more conversational semicircle. The witnesses remain, though. The notaries remain. This will be recorded.\n\nOnce seated, Capranica folds his hands precisely. \"Your Majesty, I must first express His Holiness Pope Martin V's profound joy at your renunciation and commitment to the crusade. The Holy Father was deeply moved—unprecedented, he called it. He charged me with ensuring this sacred work proceeds according to God's will and proper ecclesiastical procedure.\"\n\n\"We share that goal,\" you say.\n\n\"Excellent.\" Capranica produces a scroll—the first of many, you suspect. \"I have prepared an outline of protocols for crusade administration. With your permission, I would like to review these so we ensure canonical propriety in all matters.\"\n\nÁlvaro shifts beside you. You can feel his irritation.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" you suggest, \"we might begin with introductions and general discussion? Understanding each other's roles before diving into procedural details?\"\n\nCapranica looks faintly surprised, as if this hadn't occurred to him. \"Of... course. Yes. Quite proper.\" He sets the scroll aside with visible reluctance.\n\n\"I am Cardinal Domenico Capranica, appointed Legate a latere by His Holiness. I bring full papal authority for matters related to the crusade, including administration of funds, verification of crusader vows, approval of military chaplains, oversight of indulgence distribution, and coordination with episcopal authorities.\" He says this like reciting legal precedent.\n\n\"I have brought forty-five thousand florins from the papal treasury, along with comprehensive documentation of crusade privileges, letters to all Spanish bishops commanding cooperation, and appropriate staff to manage ecclesiastical administration.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"I understand, Your Majesty, that you have already begun crusade activities—recruitment, fund-raising, even military planning. This is... commendable. However, certain protocols must be observed to ensure canonical validity.\"\n\nHere it comes.\n\n\"For example,\" Capranica continues, \"crusader vows must be administered by authorized clergy with proper witnesses and documentation. I have brought standardized forms. Any vows taken without these forms would need to be... regularized.\"\n\nÁlvaro speaks up, his voice carefully neutral: \"Your Eminence, His Majesty has already accepted one hundred fifty-one crusader vows, properly witnessed by his confessor Fray Hernando Díaz and recorded in official ledgers. Are you suggesting these vows are invalid?\"\n\nCapranica blinks. \"Not invalid, precisely. But they should be verified. Cross-referenced against canonical requirements. Properly documented according to papal standards.\"\n\n\"They are documented,\" Álvaro says, an edge entering his voice. \"Extensively. Every crusader's name, origin, date of vow, witnesses present. What further documentation does Your Eminence require?\"\n\n\"I would need to review the existing records,\" Capranica says. \"Compare them to proper forms. Ensure all requirements were met. This is not a criticism, you understand—simply proper procedure.\"\n\nYou intervene before Álvaro's frustration becomes visible. \"Your Eminence, we welcome your review. Don Álvaro's brother Diego maintains meticulous records. We'll provide everything for your inspection.\"\n\nCapranica looks pleased. \"Excellent. Now, regarding financial administration...\"\n\nThe next hour is exhausting.\n\nCapranica has Opinions—documented, referenced, cross-referenced—about everything:\n\nCrusade funds must be kept in separate accounts, administered jointly by royal and ecclesiastical authorities, with monthly reconciliations and reports to Rome. Any expenditure over five hundred florins requires his written approval. Any over one thousand requires consultation with a financial council he proposes to establish.\n\nRecruitment should follow standardized procedures: physical examination by approved physicians, spiritual examination by appointed clergy (he has a list), vow administration using proper forms, equipment distribution documented with receipts, regular musters to verify continued presence.\n\nMilitary planning should include consultation with church authorities to ensure crusade tactics align with Just War principles. Any major strategic decisions—sieges, truces, territorial negotiations—should be reviewed for canonical implications.\n\nThe wedding itself requires extensive preparation. He has brought detailed protocols for crowning a queen during a wedding Mass. The ceremony will require specific vestments (which he's brought), particular prayers (which he's written out), proper timing (which he's calculated), and appropriate witnesses (which he'll designate).\n\nThroughout all of this, the notaries write furiously. Capranica references canon law, precedent from previous crusades, papal bulls, conciliar decrees. He is not hostile—not exactly. He's thorough. Obsessively, maddeningly thorough.\n\nWhen he finally pauses, you've been sitting for nearly two hours.\n\n\"Your Eminence,\" you say carefully, \"your thoroughness honors the Holy Father. However, the crusade must also move with appropriate speed. Granada will not wait for paperwork.\"\n\nCapranica nods seriously. \"Of course, Your Majesty. Which is why proper procedures, established now, will prevent delays later. A well-ordered crusade is an effective crusade.\"\n\nÁlvaro can't restrain himself: \"Your Eminence, with respect, His Majesty has recruited one hundred fifty-one crusaders, raised over three hundred thousand florins, secured a major foreign alliance, negotiated with Aragon, held a successful council, and traveled here with unprecedented popular support. This crusade is already well-ordered and moving rapidly.\"\n\nCapranica regards Álvaro coolly. \"And yet, none of this has been properly submitted to ecclesiastical review. Canonical validity requires procedure, Don Álvaro. Enthusiasm without procedure is chaos.\"\n\nThe tension in the room is palpable.\n\nYou stand, ending the meeting before it deteriorates further. \"Your Eminence, we are grateful for your service and look forward to working together. Perhaps we might continue these discussions in smaller increments? Don Álvaro will coordinate with your staff to provide documentation you require.\"\n\nCapranica stands as well, bowing correctly. \"Of course, Your Majesty. I have prepared a proposed schedule of regular consultations—perhaps three times weekly?—to ensure proper coordination.\"\n\nThree meetings a week. For procedural review.\n\n\"We'll see what's feasible,\" you say diplomatically. \"Don Álvaro?\"\n\nOutside, in the corridor, Álvaro explodes in a whisper: \"Three meetings a week! Financial councils! Approval for every expenditure over five hundred florins! Your Majesty, that man is going to strangle this crusade in red tape!\"\n\n\"Can we work with him?\"\n\nÁlvaro takes a breath, forcing calm. \"We'll have to. He controls forty-five thousand florins and represents the Pope. But Your Majesty...\" He looks at you seriously. \"Every reform you're planning—the tax assessments, the crusade exemptions, the rapid mobilization—he's going to want to review all of it. Extensively. And he has the authority to delay things while he does.\"\n\n\"So we manage him carefully,\" you say. \"Give him documentation, listen to his concerns, but don't let him control the pace.\"\n\n\"Easier said than done.\" Álvaro grimaces. \"But yes. We manage him. Carefully.\"\n\nStatus Summary:\n\nDate: January 8, 1431, Late Morning\n\nLocation: Toledo\n\nCardinal Capranica:\nAge 62, bureaucratic administrator\n\nBrought 45,000 florins and extensive documentation\n\nRequires extensive procedural review of all crusade activities\n\nWants three weekly meetings, approval authority over major expenditures\n\nWill officiate wedding with elaborate protocols\n\nNot hostile but extremely thorough—will slow everything down\n\nIsabel: Settling into Toledo, growing confidence, nervous about wedding/crowning\n\nWedding: 37 days away (February 15)\n\nNext steps: Manage Capranica while preparing for wedding and continuing crusade preparations\n\nWhat do you do next?"

In regards to the actual oath taken by crusaders, we have used the common crusader oath, but we can amend these for future recruits and existing crusaders can re-affirm their oaths according to your directions before the crusade begins.\n\n\nGreat suggestion regarding the oversight committe for the funds you have brought with you.

This protects both the integrity of the crusade and Your Majesty's spiritual standing.\"\n\nÁlvaro's jaw tightens almost imperceptibly, but he says nothing.\n\nThe Archbishop speaks up for the first time, his elderly voice careful: \"Your Eminence, surely His Majesty's personal funds, used at his discretion for the crusade, need not require the same level of oversight as papal treasury funds?\"\n\nCapranica turns to him with the patience of a teacher addressing a slow student. \"Your Grace, when private funds are dedicated to a papal crusade, they become sanctified for holy purpose. To ensure no funds are misused—however innocently—proper accounting serves both earthly and divine justice.\"\n\nHe looks back to you. \"However, I am not unreasonable.

For routine military expenditures—provisions, equipment replacement, soldier pay, forage—Your Majesty's quartermasters may act with autonomy, provided they maintain detailed ledgers for quarterly review.

In such cases, expenditures may proceed with subsequent notification and justification within ten days.\"\n\nÁlvaro speaks carefully: \"Your Eminence, in active campaign, expenditures exceeding two thousand florins might occur daily. Provisioning twelve thousand men, maintaining siege works, bribing informants, ransoming captured nobles—warfare is expensive and unpredictable.\"\n\nCapranica nods. \"Which is why pre-approved campaign budgets are essential.

          "text": "The Budget Collaboration\n\nToledo, January 8th-16th, 1431\n\nThe First Meeting\n\nJanuary 8th, Afternoon\n\nÁlvaro returns from the meeting with Capranica and immediately seeks out Father Tommaso Parentucelli in the Archbishop's administrative offices. He expects another bureaucrat, perhaps a younger version of Capranica—precise, rigid, obsessed with forms.\n\nWhat he finds surprises him.\n\nTommaso is perhaps forty, with ink-stained fingers and the slightly disheveled look of someone who's been working through papers since dawn. When Álvaro enters, the Italian priest is arguing—politely but firmly—with one of Capranica's other administrators about supply chain logistics.\n\n\"...the problem isn't the accounting method, it's that you're tracking purchases rather than deliveries. Half your provisions never reach the army, so your books show expenditure but the soldiers starve. Track deliveries, impose penalties for shortfalls, and—\" He notices Álvaro and straightens. \"Ah. Don Álvaro de Luna?\"\n\nThey speak briefly—establishing what needs to be done, the two-week timeline, the scope. Tommaso listens intently, occasionally jotting notes, asking sharp questions about Castilian military organization, Granada's geography, local prices.\n\n\"Two armies, naval support, four to five month campaign, twelve thousand men estimated,\" Tommaso summarizes. \"Cardinal Capranica will want this organized by army, by month, by expenditure category, with supporting documentation for all estimates.\"\n\n\"Can it be done in two weeks?\" Álvaro asks.\n\nTommaso grins—the first genuine emotion Álvaro has seen from any of Capranica's people. \"If we work together instead of fighting over jurisdiction? Absolutely. I've done three of these for Italian campaigns. You know Castilian conditions and Granada. Between us, we'll have something solid.\"\n\n\"When do we start?\"\n\n\"Now, if you're free. I'll need to understand your existing treasury structure, current crusader obligations, equipment costs...\"\n\nThey work until evening that first day, and Álvaro leaves impressed. Tommaso is nothing like Capranica—he's practical, flexible, genuinely interested in making things work rather than enforcing procedure for its own sake.\n\nThe Collaboration Develops\n\nJanuary 9th-12th\n\nThey establish a routine. Mornings in the Archbishop's offices with Diego, reviewing ledgers, crusader records, existing financial commitments. Afternoons with military advisors—Fernán, García, even Rodrigo's detailed notes on equipment and supply needs. Evenings synthesizing everything into budget categories.\n\nThe chemistry is immediate. Álvaro provides strategic vision and local knowledge; Tommaso provides structure and experience from Italian campaigns. When Álvaro estimates provisions costs, Tommaso asks about spoilage rates, transport losses, seasonal price variations. When Tommaso proposes an accounting category, Álvaro immediately sees how it applies to specific military situations.\n\n\"You're not like the Cardinal,\" Álvaro remarks on the third day.\n\nTommaso laughs quietly. \"His Eminence is brilliant at what he does—keeping the church's finances clean, ensuring canonical propriety. But I spent ten years managing actual military campaigns in Italy before joining his staff. I know the difference between accounting theory and battlefield reality.\"\n\n\"Why work for him, then?\"\n\n\"Because he's honest. There are corrupt administrators everywhere in the church—men who skim, who take bribes, who let funds disappear. Capranica is obsessively thorough because he genuinely believes in stewardship. He's frustrating, yes, but he's good. And this crusade...\" Tommaso looks up from his papers. \"This is important. Your king actually means to fight, not just posture. I want to help make it work.\"\n\nThey tackle the complex questions together: How many crusaders will actually show up versus pledges? What's realistic attrition from disease and desertion? How much contingency reserve for unexpected expenses? What if the Genoese demand higher rates? What if Granada offers a truce mid-campaign?\n\nTommaso introduces Álvaro to Italian innovations: double-entry bookkeeping, variance tracking, scenario planning. Álvaro shows Tommaso how Castilian noble politics affect military operations, why certain expenditures are actually political investments, how frontier warfare differs from Italian city-state conflicts.\n\nBy January 12th, they're working as a seamless unit. Diego watches them with something like awe—he's never seen Álvaro collaborate this smoothly with anyone except perhaps you.\n\nThe Document Takes Shape\n\nJanuary 13th-15th\n\nThe budget that emerges is exceptional.\n\nIt's organized in three tiers:\n\nTier One: Core Campaign Expenses (Guaranteed)\n\n12,000 men (8,000 regular army, 4,000 crusaders/volunteers)\n\nFive month campaign (April-August)\n\nWages: 340,000 maravedís\n\nProvisions: 285,000 maravedís\n\nEquipment and replacement: 180,000 maravedís\n\nTransport and forage: 95,000 maravedís\n\nMedical and chaplains: 40,000 maravedís\n\nSubtotal: 940,000 maravedís (94,000 florins)\n\nTier Two: Naval and Siege Operations (High Probability)\n\nGenoese fleet (6 months): 35,000 florins\n\nBombards and siege equipment: 8,000 florins\n\nFortification of captured positions: 6,000 florins\n\nSubtotal: 49,000 florins\n\nTier Three: Contingencies and Opportunities\n\nIntelligence and bribes: 5,000 florins\n\nUnexpected repairs/replacements: 8,000 florins\n\nDiplomatic expenses (truces, negotiations): 4,000 florins\n\nReserve for opportunities (defections, surprise): 10,000 florins\n\nSubtotal: 27,000 florins\n\nTotal Campaign Budget: ~170,000 florins\n\nBut it's not just numbers. Tommaso and Álvaro include:\n\nMonth-by-month cashflow projections\n\nSeparate tracking for each army (Western coastal, Eastern raiding)\n\nVariance scenarios (10% more/fewer troops, campaign extending to September, early victories reducing costs)\n\nSupply chain documentation (where provisions purchased, transport routes, storage locations)\n\nAccountability mechanisms (weekly reports from quartermasters, monthly audits, crusader marshal oversight)\n\nCross-references to existing treasury accounts and available funds\n\nIt's 47 pages of detailed, realistic, defensible budgeting.\n\nTommaso finishes the final draft on January 15th, a full six days early. He and Álvaro review it once more, then Tommaso sits back.\n\n\"This is the best military budget I've ever produced,\" he says simply. \"Cardinal Capranica will be impressed. Hell, the Pope would be impressed.\"\n\nÁlvaro claps him on the shoulder. \"I couldn't have done this without you. Your structure, your experience with Italian campaigns—it made all the difference.\"\n\n\"And I couldn't have done it without your local knowledge and strategic sense.\" Tommaso grins. \"We make a good team, Don Álvaro. When this crusade actually launches, I'm requesting assignment as field auditor with the western army. Someone needs to ensure the accounting keeps up with your king's ambitions.\"\n\nThey've become friends. More than that—working partners who respect each other's abilities. When Capranica inevitably becomes difficult (and Álvaro suspects he will), having Tommaso as an ally within the papal administration will be invaluable.\n\nPresentation to Cardinal Capranica\n\nJanuary 16th\n\nCapranica reviews the budget for three hours, page by page, occasionally asking questions. Álvaro and Tommaso answer together, demonstrating the depth of their work.\n\nFinally, Capranica sets down the document. \"Gentlemen, this is... exemplary. The detail, the structure, the contingency planning—this exceeds my expectations considerably.\"\n\nHe looks at Tommaso with something approaching pride. \"Father Tommaso, you've outdone yourself.\"\n\nThen to Álvaro: \"Don Álvaro, you've demonstrated why His Majesty trusts you. This level of financial planning will serve the crusade well.\"\n\nHe makes a few minor suggestions—additional documentation here, slightly larger contingency there—but approves the budget in principle. \"We'll review this with His Majesty and the oversight committee within the week. Once approved, this becomes the framework for all campaign expenditure.\"\n\nAfter they leave, Tommaso mutters to Álvaro: \"That's the most praise I've heard from him in five years.\"\n\n\"We earned it,\" Álvaro replies.\n\nWord reaches you that evening: the campaign budget is complete, ahead of schedule, and Capranica is impressed. The oversight committee can meet to formally approve it whenever you're ready.\n\nÁlvaro also mentions, almost casually, that Father Tommaso is \"surprisingly competent\" and \"might actually be useful going forward.\"\n\nComing from Álvaro, that's high praise indeed.\n\nStatus Summary:\n\nDate: January 16, 1431, Evening\n\nCampaign Budget: Complete, 170,000 florins total, exceptionally detailed\n\nÁlvaro-Tommaso Partnership: Strong working relationship established\n\nNext Step: Oversight committee meeting to formally approve budget\n\nWedding: 30 days away (February 15)\n\nCapranica Relationship: Still in honeymoon period (deterioration coming in 1-2 weeks)\n\nWhat do you do next?"

Transport Ships:\n\nBeyond the Genoese combat ships, how many dedicated transport vessels do you want to budget for supplying the coastal army?\n\nAre these hired or purchased?\n\n3. Noble Levies:\n\nThe Military Orders provide 4,500 paid troops\n\nBeyond that, are noble levies serving as feudal obligation (unpaid) or are they paid from the campaign budget?\n\nIf paid, at what rate?\n\n4. \"Regular Army\":\n\nThe Western Army is 12,000 total\n\nIf we subtract Military Orders (4,500) and Crusaders (let's estimate 500-800 by April), that leaves ~7,000\n\nAre these 7,000 troops noble levies (feudal obligation) or paid royal troops?\n\nIf paid, at what rate?\n\n5. Artillery Costs:\n\nThe bombards cost ~90,000-100,000 maravedís total\n\nDoes this include: gunpowder, ammunition, transport, all specialist wages for the full campaign?\n\nOr do we need to budget additional ammunition/powder costs?\n\n6.

Now it's 20,000, so the noble levy number needs to be recalculated.\n\nLet me ask these questions.\n\nGood, I'm getting clearer. Just need to clarify the Eastern Army composition with the new 20,000 number:\n\nEastern Army Composition (20,000 total - REVISED):\n\nYou mentioned:\n\n2,000 crown troops\n\n3,000 Military Order troops\n\n3,000 cavalry raiders (10 groups of 300)\n\nThe rest noble levies\n\nQuestions:\n\nAre the 3,000 cavalry raiders a separate category, or are they drawn from the crown/orders/levies?\n\nIf separate: 20,000 = 2,000 crown + 3,000 orders + 3,000 raiders + 12,000 levies\n\nIf drawn from existing troops: 20,000 = 2,000 crown + 3,000 orders + 15,000 levies (with 3,000 of those levies serving as the cavalry raiders)\n\nThe 4,000 infantry reserve you mentioned earlier - is this:\n\nA separate force (so 20,000 + 4,000 reserve = 24,000 total)?\n\nOr included in the 20,000 (so 3,000 raiders + 4,000 reserve + 13,000 other = 20,000)?\n\nTotal Force Commitment Across Both Armies:\n\nWestern: 12,000\n\nEastern: 20,000\n\nTotal: 32,000 troops\n\nIs this correct?\n\nNoble Levy Total:\n\nWith these new numbers, how many total noble levies are we summoning?\n\nWestern: ~8,700-9,000\n\nEastern: ~12,000-15,000 (depending on raider question)\n\nTotal: ~21,000-24,000 levies?\n\nOnce I have this clear, I can draft the complete budget!"

          "text": "Alright, let me create a comprehensive campaign budget document for the 1431 Crusade. I need to:\n\n1. Estimate historical costs for Genoese ships\n2. Calculate all troop wages\n3. Provision costs for 35,000 troops for 8 months\n4. Naval costs\n5. Artillery and siege equipment\n6. All other campaign expenses\n\nLet me work through this systematically using historical data and the information from the project files.\n\n**Historical Ship Costs (1430s):**\n- Genoese war galleys typically cost 300-500 florins per month to hire (crew, maintenance, combat readiness)\n- I'll use 400 florins/month as mid-range\n- 12 Genoese galleys × 400 florins × 8 months = 38,400 florins\n- Transport ships cheaper, maybe 150 florins/month\n- 10 transports × 150 florins × 8 months = 12,000 florins\n- Portuguese 8 galleys are free (dowry), but we pay provisions for crews\n\n**Troop Wages (Crown's Responsibility):**\n- 3,000 crown troops @ 2 maravedís/day = 6,000 maravedís/day = 180,000/month = 1,440,000 for 8 months\n- 700 crusaders @ 60 maravedís/month = 42,000/month = 336,000 for 8 months\n- Plus 200 maravedís bonus per crusader = 140,000 one-time\n- Officers, specialists need higher wages\n\n**Provisions for 35,000 troops:**\n- Medieval armies: ~2 pounds bread, 1 pound meat/fish, wine per day per soldier\n- Cost: roughly 1-1.5 maravedís per soldier per day for basic provisions\n- 35,000 × 1.25 maravedís × 240 days = 10,500,000 maravedís\n\n- Converting to florins reveals a substantial provisioning expense of approximately 39,600 florins\n\n**Artillery Costs:**\n- Specialized siege equipment requires significant investment\n- 4-6 bombards with full crew support cost around 95,000 maravedís\n- This translates to roughly 360 florins for critical military infrastructure\n\nI'll create a comprehensive campaign budget document based on all the information we've established.

Conservative Scenario (As Budgeted)\n- **Total Cost:** 143,171 florins\n- Assumes: Moderate recruitment success, average siege durations, normal attrition\n- Contingency reserve: 32,000 florins (22% of base budget)\n\n### B. Optimistic Scenario (Lower Cost)\n- **Estimated Cost:** 128,000 florins (-11%)\n- Factors: Quick victories, fewer sieges needed, lower attrition, good weather\n- Savings in: Provisions (less spoilage), naval (fewer operations), contingency (less needed)\n\n### C. Pessimistic Scenario (Higher Cost)\n- **Estimated Cost:** 168,000 florins (+17%)\n- Factors: Prolonged sieges, higher casualties, bad weather, Granada resistance stronger than expected\n- Overruns in: Provisions, siege operations, medical care, contingency fully expended\n\n### D. Extended Campaign Scenario (9-10 months)\n- **Estimated Additional Cost:** 15,000-18,000 florins per additional month\n- Would require additional funding authorization\n\n---\n\n## SECTION VI: FUNDING SOURCES & CASH FLOW\n\n### A.

Expected Crusade Taxation Revenue (April-November 1431)\n\n**Note:** Crusade taxation decree will be issued at campaign launch. Revenue projections are preliminary and subject to assessment program results.\n\n| Source | Estimated Annual | 8-Month Portion |\n|--------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Noble estates (5% assessment) | 8-12 million maravedís | 5-8 million maravedís |\n| Church properties (10% per bull) | 2-3 million maravedís | 1.3-2 million maravedís |\n| **Total** | **10-15 million maravedís** | **6.3-10 million maravedís** |\n| **In Florins** | **38,000-57,000 florins** | **24,000-38,000 florins** |\n\n**Note:** Revenue will flow irregularly. Assessment program begins in spring; major revenues expected June-October.\n\n### C. Cash Flow Timeline\n\n**April (Campaign Launch):**\n- Immediate needs: 35,000 florins (initial wages, naval contracts, provisions)\n- Source: Existing treasury\n\n**May-July (Campaign Build-Up):**\n- Monthly burn rate: ~15,000-18,000 florins\n- Source: Existing treasury + early taxation revenue\n\n**August-November (Sustained Operations):**\n- Monthly burn rate: ~15,000-18,000 florins\n- Source: Crusade taxation revenue (should cover or offset significant portions)\n\n**Budget Adequacy:**\n- Total campaign cost: 143,171 florins\n- Available treasury: 390,200 florins\n- **Surplus after campaign (before taxation):** 247,029 florins\n- **With taxation revenue:** 271,000-285,000 florins surplus\n\n**Conclusion:** Campaign is fully funded with substantial reserves. Crusade taxation will offset costs and build war chest for future campaigns.\n\n---\n\n## SECTION VII: EXPENDITURE CONTROLS & APPROVAL THRESHOLDS\n\n### A. Oversight Committee Structure\n- **Members:** His Majesty Juan II (or designated representative Don Álvaro de Luna), Cardinal Domenico Capranica (Papal Legate), Archbishop of Toledo\n- **Authority:** Joint approval required for expenditures as specified below\n\n### B. Approval Thresholds\n\n| Expenditure Amount | Approval Required | Timeline |\n|-------------------|------------------|----------|\n| Under 500 florins | Field commander discretion | Immediate |\n| 500-2,000 florins | Quartermaster/administrator | Documented within 10 days |\n| 2,000-5,000 florins | Oversight committee approval | Within 5 days of request |\n| Over 5,000 florins | Full committee + His Majesty | Advance approval required |\n\n### C. Emergency Authorization\n- Supreme Commander (His Majesty) may authorize up to 10,000 florins without committee for genuine battlefield emergencies\n- Requires written justification within 10 days\n- Limited to 3 uses per campaign without additional oversight\n\n### D. Reporting Requirements\n\n**Monthly Reports (due 5th of following month):**\n- Expenditures by category\n- Variance from budget\n- Force strength and casualties\n- Campaign progress\n- Projected next-month spending\n\n**Quarterly Reports (due 15 days after quarter end):**\n- Comprehensive financial review\n- Strategic assessment\n- Budget adjustment recommendations\n- Taxation revenue collection status\n\n**Final Campaign Report (due December 31, 1431):**\n- Complete accounting\n- Lessons learned\n- Recommendations for 1432 campaign\n\n---\n\n## SECTION VIII: SPECIAL NOTES & ASSUMPTIONS\n\n### A. Key Assumptions\n1. **Noble levies (26,800 troops):** Paid by their lords per feudal obligation, not included in crown budget\n2. **Military Order forces (4,500 troops):** Paid by Orders, not included in crown budget\n3. **Campaign duration:** 8 full months (April through November)\n4. **Exchange rate:** 1 florin = 265 maravedís (standard rate)\n5. **Attrition rate:** ~8-10% over campaign season (disease, desertion, casualties)\n6. **Crusader recruitment:** 700 sworn crusaders by April (conservative estimate)\n\n### B. Items NOT Included in This Budget\n- Personal expenses of His Majesty the King (paid from privy purse)\n- Wedding expenses (separate budget)\n- Diplomatic missions beyond campaign operations\n- Long-term fortification of Granada (planned for post-conquest)\n- Civilian administration of conquered territory (to be addressed as needed)\n\n### C. Risk Factors\n1. **Granada receives significant Muslim reinforcements:** Would extend campaign, increase costs\n2. **Weather disrupts naval operations:** Could delay western campaign significantly\n3. **Noble levy quality lower than expected:** Might require hiring additional professional troops\n4. **Major epidemic in army camps:** Would devastate forces, require early campaign end\n5. **Crusader recruitment lower than projected:** Would require adjusting force composition\n\n### D. Opportunities for Cost Reduction\n1. **Quick victories:** Faster conquests reduce provision and wage costs\n2. **Granada internal conflicts:** Could make some sieges unnecessary\n3. **Defections:** Granada nobles switching sides would provide intelligence, reduce resistance\n4. **Captured supplies:** Granada provisions/equipment could supplement our supplies\n5. **Better weather:** Reduces spoilage, increases campaign efficiency\n\n---\n\n## SECTION IX: RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n### A. From Don Álvaro de Luna (Royal Constable)\n\n1. **Approve budget as presented:** Provides adequate funding with significant contingency\n2. **Begin crusader recruitment immediately:** Time is short to reach 700 by April\n3. **Initiate naval contracts now:** Genoese ships must be secured before campaign season\n4. **Pre-position provisions:** Begin stockpiling in March to avoid supply bottlenecks\n5. **Appoint Crusader Marshals early:** They need time to learn their roles before campaign\n\n### B. From Father Tommaso Parentucelli (Papal Administrator)\n\n1. **Budget structure is sound:** Balances military necessity with fiscal responsibility\n2. **Contingency reserve adequate:** 22% reserve appropriate for campaign of this scale\n3. **Recommend monthly reconciliation:** More frequent review prevents drift from budget\n4. **Assessment program critical:** Taxation revenue depends on accurate assessments\n5. **Documentation standards:** All expenditures over 500 florins must have written receipts\n\n### C. Joint Recommendations\n\n1. **Establish field audit teams:** Father Tommaso's administrators should deploy with armies\n2. **Create emergency authorization protocol:** Clarify Supreme Commander's discretionary powers\n3. **Prepare for 1432 campaign:** This budget covers 1431; begin planning for continuation\n4. **Monitor Granada response:** Adjust budget if they mobilize more forces than anticipated\n5. **Build coalition support:** Additional noble contributions could reduce crown costs\n\n---\n\n## APPENDIX A: CONVERSION REFERENCE\n\n**Exchange Rate:** 1 florin = 265 maravedís\n\n| Maravedís | Florins |\n|-----------|---------|\n| 1,000 | 3.77 |\n| 5,000 | 18.87 |\n| 10,000 | 37.74 |\n| 50,000 | 188.68 |\n| 100,000 | 377.36 |\n| 500,000 | 1,886.79 |\n| 1,000,000 | 3,773.58 |\n\n---\n\n## APPENDIX B: CRUSADER WAGE STRUCTURE\n\n| Rank | Daily Wage | Monthly Wage | Notes |\n|------|------------|--------------|-------|\n| Common Crusader | - | 60 maravedís | Plus 200 maravedí joining bonus |\n| Sergeant | 4 maravedís | 120 maravedís | Command experience required |\n| Captain | 8-10 maravedís | 240-300 maravedís | Noble or proven commander |\n| Specialist (smith, engineer) | 5-8 maravedís | 150-240 maravedís | Critical skills |\n| Professional Crown Soldier | 2 maravedís | 60 maravedís | Standard military wage |\n| Master Gunner | 6 maravedís | 180 maravedís | Artillery specialist |\n| Surgeon | 4 maravedís | 120 maravedís | Medical training |\n| Chaplain | 2 maravedís | 60 maravedís | Religious duties |\n\n---\n\n**Prepared in Toledo, Kingdom of Castile**  \n**January 16, 1431**  \n\n**Signatures:**\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna, Royal Constable of Castile  \nFather Tommaso Parentucelli, Papal Legate Administrator\n\n**Pending Approval:**  \nOversight Committee (His Majesty Juan II, Cardinal Domenico Capranica, Archbishop of Toledo)\n\n1. **Total cost**: 143,171 florins (much less than the original 170,000 estimate because I carefully calculated based on what the crown actually pays vs what lords/orders pay)\n\n2. **Key numbers**:\n   - Western Army: 12,000 troops, 75,178 florins\n   - Eastern Army: 23,000 troops, 35,748 florins\n   - Shared/contingency: 32,245 florins\n\n3. **What's NOT in crown budget** (correctly excluded):\n   - 26,800 noble levies (paid by their lords)\n   - 4,500 Military Order troops (paid by Orders)\n\n4. **What IS in crown budget**:\n   - 3,000 crown professional soldiers\n   - 700 crusaders (estimated)\n   - ALL provisions for 35,000 troops\n   - All naval operations\n   - All artillery and siege equipment\n   - All logistics, medical, intelligence, etc.\n\n5. **Funding sources total**: 390,200 florins available\n   - Much more than needed for campaign\n   - Leaves surplus for future campaigns\n\n6. **The document** shows Álvaro and Tommaso's excellent collaboration - detailed, professional, realistic, with proper oversight mechanisms that satisfy Capranica's bureaucratic needs while maintaining military flexibility.\n\nThis should be exactly what Juan needs for the oversight committee meeting.\n\nI've created the comprehensive campaign budget document. Key highlights:\n\nTotal Cost: 143,171 florins (less than originally estimated because the crown doesn't pay for noble levies or Military Order troops - they pay themselves)\n\nMajor expenses:\n\nNaval operations: 53,440 florins (biggest single cost)\n\nProvisions for 35,000 troops: 45,566 florins\n\nContingency reserve: 32,000 florins (22% buffer)\n\nWages for crown troops + crusaders: 7,924 florins\n\nFunding is solid:\n\nAvailable treasury: 390,200 florins\n\nCampaign cost: 143,171 florins\n\nSurplus: 247,000+ florins (enough for future campaigns)\n\nPlus crusade taxation will generate 24,000-38,000 additional florins during the campaign\n\nThe document shows Álvaro and Tommaso's excellent collaboration - it's detailed, realistic, and includes the oversight mechanisms Capranica needs while maintaining military flexibility.\n\nWhat would you like to do next?
