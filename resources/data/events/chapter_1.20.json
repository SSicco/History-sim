          "text": "**Date:** May 29, 1431 (evening)\n**Location:** Juan is besieging Loja fortress\n\n**Key situation:**\n- Juan's eastern army (18,870 troops) just arrived at Loja after a difficult march with guerrilla harassment\n- The march cost 43 killed, 87 wounded from guerrilla attacks\n- Before that, they had a major victory at Granada (Battle of Granada's Gates on May 10) where they destroyed a sortie force, killed/captured ~2,000 enemies, and took 580 prisoners\n- They devastated the Vega (crops and mills) on May 11\n- The troops are tired from the fighting march but determined\n- Artillery (5 bombards) operational but worn\n- Western army under Estúñiga is on the western coast continuing operations\n- Queen Isabel is pregnant (~3 months), either in Jaén or returning to Toledo\n- Ahmad al-Zarqali is working with prisoners and preparing for Rome embassy\n- Various commanders are with Juan at Loja\n\n**Current military situation:**\n- Besieging Loja fortress\n- Siege just beginning (arrived evening of May 29)\n- Loja garrison is fully alerted and prepared\n- Estimated siege time: 3-4 weeks with artillery\n\n**Treasury:** ~390,000 florins estimated available\n\nSo Juan is waking up on the morning of May 30, 1431, at the siege camp outside Loja. This is the first full day of the siege.\n\nI need to:\n1. Describe what Juan sees/experiences waking up on May 30\n2. Brief on overnight events if any\n3. Present situation requiring decisions\n4. STOP and wait for Juan's actions - NOT write what he does\n\nLet me paint the scene of waking up in a siege camp, the conditions, what's happening around him, any reports that have come in overnight, and what decisions await him. \n\nThe pre-dawn light filters through the tent's canvas, casting long shadows across Juan's makeshift sleeping quarters. The camp stirs with a low murmur of activity - sentries changing watch, camp servants preparing morning fires, and the distant sounds of horses being fed and equipped. A cool morning breeze carries the smell of damp earth and distant woodsmoke, mixed with the metallic tang of weapons and leather.\n\nPerfect. Now I'll write the opening scene for Chapter 20. Juan is waking up on May 30, 1431, at the siege camp outside Loja. This is the first full day of the siege.\n\nI need to:\n1. Describe the morning scene - what he sees, hears, feels\n2. Any overnight developments (scouts, reports, etc.)\n3. Present the situation and what needs his attention\n4. STOP - do not write Juan's actions or words\n\nKeep it relatively short since this is an active scene - around 4-5 paragraphs. Paint the atmosphere of a siege camp beginning its work.\n\nChapter 20: The Siege of Loja\n\nDate: May 30, 1431 (Morning)\nLocation: Siege camp outside Loja fortress\n\nDawn breaks gray and cool over the Genil valley. You wake to the sounds of a military camp stirring to life—thousands of men coughing, speaking in low voices, the clatter of cookpots and the whinny of horses being fed. Your tent sits on a low rise perhaps half a mile from Loja's walls, close enough to see the fortress clearly in the morning light but beyond effective bowshot.\n\nThrough the tent opening, you can see Loja perched on its height. The fortress looks formidable in the pale dawn—thick Moorish walls of reddish stone, towers at intervals, banners flying defiantly. The town spreads below the castle proper, also walled, perhaps eight hundred buildings clustered tight. Smoke rises from morning fires within. They're watching you just as you watch them.\n\nCaptain Fernán appears at your tent. \"Your Majesty. Master Calabrese requests audience when you're ready—he's been surveying positions for the bombards since first light. The Master of Calatrava also wishes to discuss the siege lines.\" He pauses. \"And there's news from a scout patrol that returned an hour ago. They found something... unusual. Bodies. Moorish raiders, they think, but the manner of death is strange. Don Rodrigo is examining them now.\"\n\nThe camp bustles with purposeful activity. Work parties are already cutting timber for siege works. The bombards sit on their carriages near the artillery park, massive and patient. Your army, though tired from the march, is settling into the grim business of siege warfare. This will take weeks, and everyone knows it.\n\nWhat do you wish to address first?"

Describe the bodies and evidence found\n3. Show the factional conflict clearly\n4. Stop and let Juan respond/ask questions\n\nI should keep this SHORT since it's an active scene with dialogue. 2-4 paragraphs. Present the information, have Don Rodrigo explain what they found, then STOP for Juan's response.\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea arrives quickly, still wearing his riding boots caked with mud from the patrol. He's a lean man in his thirties, one of the scouts who'd proven himself during the march to Loja—sharp-eyed and methodical. He bows briefly, then gestures for two of his men to bring forward several items wrapped in cloth.\n\n\"Your Majesty, we found them about three miles north, in a ravine off the main road to Granada. Seven bodies, all Moorish. At first we thought they'd been caught by one of our patrols, but...\" He unwraps the cloth to reveal weapons—distinctly Moorish scimitars and daggers, still bloodied. \"They killed each other, Sire. The wounds match these blades, not our swords. And look at this.\"\n\nHe lays out clothing and insignia from the bodies. \"These three wore the green sash of Granada's regular forces—local men, probably from the city itself. But these four...\" He indicates different cloth, rougher weave, different colors. \"North African. Berber tribal patterns, likely from the Sultan's Maghrebi reinforcements. The wounds suggest the Granadans attacked the Berbers, or perhaps the other way—hard to say who started it. But it was vicious. Close combat, personal. This wasn't battle confusion. This was murder between allies.\"\n\nHe pauses, meeting your eyes. \"There's more, Your Majesty. We found tracks suggesting a larger group was there—perhaps twenty men total. The survivors fled in different directions. North toward Granada, and east toward the mountains. They split apart after the killing.\"\n\nThe morning sun slants through your tent opening.

Foreign troops far from home, promised plunder and glory—then they arrive and find a grinding siege campaign instead of quick victories. And the Granada locals probably resent sharing command with outsiders.\" He gathers the evidence. \"Shall I send riders to see if we can capture any of those who fled? They might talk, especially if they're angry at their former comrades.\"\n\nBefore you can answer, Master Gunner Pietro Calabrese appears at the tent entrance, his weathered face creased with satisfaction. \"Your Majesty, forgive the interruption. The positions are ready for your inspection, if you wish.\"\n\nYou follow him outside into the brightening morning. The camp sprawls across the valley floor—thousands of tents, picket lines of horses, supply wagons in neat rows. Calabrese leads you to the northern edge of the camp where your five medium bombards wait.\n\n\"We have two good positions, Sire.\" He points toward Loja with a gnarled finger. \"See there—that ridge, four hundred yards from the main gate? Solid ground, good angle of fire, close enough for accuracy. I can put three bombards there to hammer the gatehouse and the wall sections on either side. It's within their bowshot, so we'll need mantlets and gabions for the gun crews.\"\n\nHe turns, indicating a second rise to the east. \"And there—that hillock overlooks the town's eastern wall where it's thinnest, near the postern gate. Two bombards there can breach that section while the three at the main gate keep the defenders' heads down. Classic two-point bombardment.\"\n\nHe pauses, his expression turning serious. \"But Your Majesty, the bombards are tired from the march. The barrels need inspection for cracks, the carriages need repair, and we're low on quality powder—the rough jostle on the road settled the ingredients poorly. I need two days minimum to make everything ready, three would be better. Rush it, and we risk a barrel bursting.\"\n\nThe Italian gunner meets your gaze steadily, waiting for your decision on timing."

I'll acknowledge Calabrese's response, maybe show him getting to work, and then present the next situation that needs Juan's attention (perhaps the Master of Calatrava wanting to discuss siege lines, or other matters that arose in the opening).\n\nI need to avoid writing Juan's actions or thoughts - just present the world's response and the next situation.\n\nCalabrese's weathered face breaks into a relieved smile. \"Wise decision, Your Majesty. Better three days of proper work than a burst barrel that kills good men and leaves us with four guns instead of five.\" He bows. \"I'll have my crews inspect every inch of metal and wood. When we open fire, you'll have five bombards in perfect order, not gambling pieces.\"\n\nThe master gunner strides off toward the artillery park, already barking orders to his crews in Italian-accented Castilian. You can see men immediately begin unloading tools and setting up inspection stations around each massive gun.\n\nThe Master of Calatrava approaches, armor gleaming in the morning sun despite the dust of the march. \"Your Majesty, I overheard—three days for the guns. Good. That gives us time to do this properly.\" He gestures toward Loja. \"We need siege lines completely encircling the fortress. Cut off their water from the river, prevent any messengers or reinforcements from slipping through, establish proper supply routes back to Alcalá. My engineers estimate four days to dig comprehensive trenches and build the necessary fortifications.\"\n\nHe pauses, studying the fortress. \"We also need to decide on terms, Sire. Do we offer them a chance to surrender before the bombardment begins? Some commanders believe it's honorable to give one opportunity. Others say it just gives defenders time to prepare and strengthen morale. Either way, once those bombards open fire, surrender becomes much less likely—pride demands they hold out after blood is spilled.\"\n\nThe morning sun climbs higher.

factional conflict (the dead bodies)\n- They know Juan has artillery\n- They're isolated but not yet bombarded\n- Sultan's prestige is damaged but Granada hasn't collapsed\n- Foreign reinforcements are in Granada\n\nThe table should reflect realistic medieval garrison responses:\n- Outright surrender very unlikely (maybe 1-10%)\n- Negotiation attempts more likely than surrender\n- Defiance most likely\n- Proactive sallies or tricks possible but risky for them\n- Internal problems (factional issues) could surface\n\nLet me structure this from most passive/surrender to most aggressive/unusual.\n\nD100 Table: Loja Garrison's Response to Surrender Offer\n\nContext: Fortress garrison receives formal offer to surrender before bombardment begins\n\n1-5: IMMEDIATE UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER\n\nGates open, white flags raised within hours\n\nCommander surrenders fortress intact with full garrison\n\nCites recent Granada defeat, no hope of relief, desire to avoid bloodshed\n\nImplications: Complete victory, fortress taken without siege, but suspiciously easy\n\nConsiderations: Could be genuine despair or potential trap\n\n6-15: NEGOTIATED SURRENDER WITH CONDITIONS\n\nGarrison sends envoys to negotiate terms\n\nRequest: Safe passage to Granada for garrison, retention of personal property, no enslavement\n\nWilling to yield fortress if terms acceptable\n\nImplications: Victory achievable through negotiation, saves time and lives\n\nConsiderations: Terms might be reasonable or overly ambitious\n\n16-25: OFFER TO CONVERT AND SWEAR FEALTY\n\nCommander offers to convert to Christianity and hold fortress for Castile\n\nGarrison divided—some willing to convert, others resistant\n\nProposes becoming Castilian vassal controlling this region\n\nImplications: Potentially huge strategic gain but reliability questionable\n\nConsiderations: Genuine conversion or expedient survival tactic?\n\n26-40: DEFIANT REFUSAL, PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION\n\nPolite but firm rejection of surrender\n\nGarrison settles in for long siege\n\nProfessional defensive preparations, no heroics or provocations\n\nImplications: Standard siege warfare, no surprises\n\nOutcome: Siege proceeds as expected\n\n41-60: HOSTILE REFUSAL WITH PROPAGANDA\n\nAngry rejection, possible insults to Juan or Castile\n\nDefenders display confidence, mock Christian forces\n\nPlant banners, shout defiance, make show of strength\n\nImplications: High morale defense, psychological warfare\n\nOutcome: Defenders trying to intimidate, siege will be contested\n\n61-70: STALLING TACTICS\n\nRequest time to \"consider\" the offer\n\nAsk for clarifications, negotiations drag out\n\nUsing time to strengthen defenses or await relief\n\nImplications: Garrison buying time, not serious about surrender\n\nConsiderations: Exposes their strategy (waiting for reinforcements?)\n\n71-80: LIMITED SORTIE TO TEST STRENGTH\n\nSmall raiding party (50-100 men) attacks siege works or scouts\n\nProbing Castilian defenses and response time\n\nQuick retreat back to fortress\n\nImplications: Aggressive garrison, testing your capabilities\n\nOutcome: Minor combat, casualties possible, intelligence gathered by both sides\n\n81-88: MAJOR SALLY ATTEMPT\n\nSignificant force (300-500 men) emerges for aggressive action\n\nTarget: Disrupt artillery positioning, raid supply lines, or attack camp\n\nSerious attempt to damage siege preparations before bombardment begins\n\nImplications: Dangerous escalation, significant combat\n\nOutcome: Battle outside fortress, casualties on both sides\n\n89-94: FACTIONAL SPLIT WITHIN GARRISON\n\nInternal conflict between Granada loyalists and foreign troops\n\nOne faction tries to surrender/negotiate while other resists\n\nPossible violence within fortress, confusion visible on walls\n\nImplications: Exploitable division, echoes the bodies found earlier\n\nOutcome: Opportunity for diplomatic/psychological pressure\n\n95-97: MESSENGER ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE\n\nGarrison tries to send rider(s) to Granada requesting relief\n\nDesperate attempt to break through siege lines at night\n\nMay carry intelligence about Castilian forces\n\nImplications: They're hoping for rescue, reveals desperation\n\nOutcome: Chase/pursuit, potential prisoner with intelligence\n\n98-100: ELABORATE DECEPTION ATTEMPT\n\nApparent surrender offer is actually trap\n\nPlan to ambush negotiators, poison envoys, or fake defection to attack\n\nOr: Fake internal conflict to lure Castilians into ambush\n\nImplications: Dangerous, underhanded tactics\n\nOutcome: Assassination/ambush attempt, potential casualties to command staff\n\nNotes:\n\n1-25 (25%): Some form of surrender/negotiation possible\n\n26-70 (45%): Standard defensive posture,

The Sultan is weakened\n\nBUT:\n- They're in a strong fortress\n- They might hope for reinforcements from the Sultan or North African allies\n- Surrendering immediately after one battle would be seen as cowardice\n- Muslim fortresses historically held out quite stubbornly during the Reconquista\n- Their commander would face severe consequences if he surrendered too easily\n- Islamic law and honor codes would push them to resist\n\nHistorical context:\n- During the actual Reconquista, fortresses often held out for months\n- Surrender typically came only after prolonged bombardment, starvation, or clear hopelessness\n- Immediate surrender was rare unless there were special circumstances (betrayal, disease, etc.)\n\nSo 25% chance of surrender before any fighting? That's way too high. Maybe 5-10% at most, and those would be unusual circumstances.\n\nLet me redraft with more realistic probabilities:\n- Most likely (60-70%): They refuse and prepare to defend\n- Moderate chance (20-25%): They do something aggressive or try delaying tactics\n- Small chance (10-15%): Unusual circumstances (factional split, negotiations, etc.)\n- Very small chance (1-5%): Surrender or conversion\n\nI should also consider what factors work for/against Juan:\n\nFAVORING JUAN (Why they might surrender/negotiate):\n- Recent crushing defeat of Granada's sortie\n- Artillery presence (they know what bombards can do)\n- No immediate relief force visible\n- Juan's mercy to converters is becoming known\n\n- The region faces profound economic collapse from the campaign's devastation\n- Internal political fractures weaken their resistance potential\n- The strategic landscape suggests prolonged conflict will only intensify their vulnerability\n\nAGAINST JUAN (Why they'll resist):\n- Strong fortress provides significant defensive advantages\n- Religious and cultural imperatives demand steadfast opposition\n- Potential for external support remains a psychological lifeline\n- Surrendering early would undermine future resistance strategies\n- Personal and collective honor demands defiance\n- The garrison remains intact and motivated\n- No direct assault has yet challenged their position\n\n, leaving uncertainty about potential destruction\n\nYou're absolutely right to question that. Let me reconsider the situation realistically:\n\nFactors Analysis\n\nWORKING IN JUAN'S FAVOR:\n\nRecent devastating victory at Granada (they witnessed the sortie force destroyed)\n\nFive bombards visible and positioning (psychological threat)\n\nVega devastation shows Juan's ruthlessness when needed\n\nWord spreading that converters receive mercy and opportunity\n\nNo relief force visibly approaching\n\nEarly summer - long campaign season ahead means more sieges coming\n\nEvidence of factional tensions in Granada's forces (the bodies)\n\nWORKING AGAINST JUAN:\n\nStrong fortress in defensible position - they have confidence in their walls\n\nIslamic duty/honor demands resistance against crusaders\n\nSurrendering immediately without a fight would be seen as cowardice\n\nCommander faces severe consequences (execution, dishonor) if he yields too easily\n\nGarrison is fresh, well-supplied, not yet starved or diseased\n\nHope for reinforcements from Sultan or North African allies\n\nEarly in campaign - if Loja falls immediately, other fortresses lose hope\n\nNo bombardment yet - they don't know how terrible it will actually be\n\nHistorical precedent: Muslim fortresses typically held out for weeks/months\n\nREALISTIC ASSESSMENT: Immediate surrender before any siege warfare is very unlikely (~5% or less). Most fortresses surrendered only after prolonged bombardment, starvation, disease, or clear hopelessness. The garrison would be expected to at least test Castilian resolve.\n\nLet me redraft with realistic probabilities:\n\nREVISED D100 Table: Loja Garrison Response\n\n1-3: IMMEDIATE UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER (3% - Very Unlikely)\n\nGates open within hours, white flags raised\n\nWhy it could happen: Commander secretly despairs, garrison mutinous, internal crisis\n\nRealistic factors: Would require extraordinary circumstances - disease outbreak, assassination of commander, secret betrayal already arranged\n\nRed flags: Suspiciously easy, possibly a trap\n\n4-8: NEGOTIATED CONDITIONAL SURRENDER (5% - Unlikely)\n\nEnvoys come to negotiate terms within 1-2 days\n\nRequest safe passage to Granada, retention of property, no slavery\n\nWhy it could happen: Pragmatic commander sees writing on wall, wants to save lives\n\nRealistic factors: Would need commander with unusual foresight and garrison agreement - rare but possible\n\nConsiderations: Terms might be steep (they know Juan wants quick victory)\n\n9-14: OFFER TO CONVERT (COMMANDER OR FACTION) (6% - Unlikely)\n\nCommander or significant faction offers to convert and hold for Castile\n\nInternal division visible\n\nWhy it could happen: Opportunistic commander, or factional split exploiting earlier tensions\n\nRealistic factors: Echoes the Berber/Granadan conflict from the bodies - one group might betray others\n\nRisk: Reliability highly questionable, could be elaborate deception\n\n15-25: STALLING AND DELAYING TACTICS (11% - Possible)\n\n\"We need time to consider,\" \"Let us consult with our ulema,\" etc.\n\nRequest clarifications, ask for envoys to explain terms\n\nWhy it happens: Buying time to strengthen defenses or await relief\n\nRealistic factors: Common tactic - costs them nothing, gives intelligence on Juan's patience\n\nOutcome: Reveals they're waiting for something (reinforcements? Sultan's orders?)\n\n26-70: DEFIANT REFUSAL, PREPARE FOR SIEGE (45% - Most Likely)\n\nPolite but firm \"We cannot surrender\" or outright hostile rejection\n\nGarrison settles into defensive positions\n\nRange of morale from grimly determined to loudly defiant\n\nWhy it happens: Expected response - honor, duty, hope for relief, confidence in walls\n\nRealistic factors: Standard medieval siege warfare begins\n\nOutcome: Siege proceeds as planned, bombardment in 3 days\n\n71-82: HOSTILE REFUSAL WITH PROPAGANDA (12% - Possible)\n\nAngry rejection with insults\n\nDisplay of confidence: banners, shouting, mocking crusaders\n\nPossible display of captured Christian items or prisoners to intimidate\n\nWhy it happens: High garrison morale, trying psychological warfare\n\nRealistic factors: Young garrison eager to prove themselves, or experienced veterans unimpressed by threats\n\nOutcome: Defenders' morale high, will resist stubbornly\n\n83-90: LIMITED PROBING SORTIE (8% - Possible)\n\nSmall raid (30-80 men) against siege works or scouts\n\nQuick strike then retreat, testing Castilian alertness\n\nWhy it happens: Aggressive commander wants intelligence on enemy quality\n\nRealistic factors: Smart military tactics - learn enemy's response time and discipline\n\nOutcome: Minor skirmish, few casualties, both sides learn about each other\n\n91-95: MESSENGER ESCAPE ATTEMPT (5% - Unlikely but Possible)\n\nRider(s) try to break through siege lines at night\n\nDesperate dash to Granada requesting relief\n\nWhy it happens: Garrison hoping for rescue, needs to inform Sultan of situation\n\nRealistic factors: Logical move if they think relief is possible\n\nOutcome: Chase sequence, potential prisoner with intelligence if caught\n\n96-98: MAJOR SALLY BEFORE BOMBARDMENT (3% - Unlikely)\n\nSignificant force (200-400 men) attempts aggressive action\n\nTarget: Destroy siege engines, raid artillery positions, disrupt preparations\n\nWhy it happens: Desperate/aggressive commander wants to hit before bombardment begins\n\nRealistic factors: Risky but not insane - hitting guns before they fire is smart\n\nOutcome: Serious battle, significant casualties possible both sides\n\n99-100: FACTIONAL VIOLENCE ERUPTS INSIDE (2% - Very Unlikely)\n\nInternal conflict between different groups becomes visible\n\nFighting on walls, confusion, smoke from inside fortress\n\nPossible faction trying to open gates vs. loyalists preventing it\n\nWhy it happens: Berber/Granadan tensions from earlier evidence explodes under pressure\n\nRealistic factors: Stress of siege bringing existing rifts to crisis\n\nOutcome: Exploitable chaos, possible opportunity for infiltration or negotiation with one faction\n\nProbability Summary:\n\nSurrender/Negotiation (1-14): 14% - Unlikely but possible under special circumstances\n\nDelaying Tactics (15-25): 11% - Reasonably possible\n\nStandard Refusal (26-70): 45% - Most likely outcome\n\nAggressive Refusal (71-82): 12% - Possible\n\nProactive Military Action (83-95): 13% - Possible\n\nExtraordinary Events (96-100): 5% - Unlikely\n\nMost Realistic Outcome Range: 26-82 (57%) - Some form of refusal and defensive preparation\n\nThis reflects historical reality: fortresses usually held out, but there were occasional surprises.

The outcomes balance technical capabilities, preparation, and the inherent unpredictability of artillery in this period.\n\nBombardment Progress Analysis\n\nLet me first assess the realistic factors:\n\nWORKING IN FAVOR OF EFFECTIVE BOMBARDMENT:\n\nFive medium bombards properly maintained and positioned\n\nExperienced Master Gunner Calabrese with practiced crews\n\nThree days of careful preparation (inspected barrels, properly mixed powder)\n\nTwo-point bombardment strategy divides defenders' attention\n\nGood positions identified (400 yards from main gate, elevated eastern approach)\n\nNo counter-battery fire (garrison has no cannons)\n\nGarrison cannot sortie easily to disrupt guns (would be suicide)\n\nCrews have experience from Íllora and previous operations\n\nEarly summer weather generally favorable\n\nWORKING AGAINST EFFECTIVE BOMBARDMENT:\n\nMedium bombards, not great bombards - less destructive than largest guns\n\nGuns worn from march and previous sieges despite inspection\n\nPowder settled during transport, quality somewhat degraded\n\nMoorish fortress walls thick and well-maintained\n\nElevated fortress position makes some angles difficult\n\nGun crews within bowshot - defenders can harass them, slowing operations\n\nDefenders can repair damage at night with rubble and timber\n\n15th century artillery rate of fire slow (6-10 shots per gun per day maximum)\n\nBreaching thick fortress walls takes time even with good bombardment\n\nPossible mechanical failures despite preparation\n\nWeather could turn (summer storms, high winds affect accuracy)\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXT:\n\nMedieval fortresses with bombards typically took 1-3 weeks of bombardment to create viable breach\n\nSurrender often came after breach was made but before assault (to avoid sack)\n\nLoja is a substantial fortress, not a minor outpost - walls designed to resist\n\nDefenders' morale matters - will they negotiate once walls damaged?\n\nD100 Table: Bombardment Progress at Loja\n\n1-2: CATASTROPHIC FAILURE (2% - Very Unlikely)\n\nBarrel bursts on one of the bombards within first few days\n\nKills/wounds crew, destroys gun, damages morale\n\nWhy it could happen: Hidden crack missed in inspection, powder defect, bad luck\n\nConsequences: Down to 4 guns, delay while repairs attempted, setback of 4-7 days\n\nRealistic factors: Rare but possible - this is why Calabrese wanted 3 days prep\n\n3-8: MAJOR SETBACK (6% - Unlikely)\n\nSerious mechanical failure (carriage breaks, barrel cracks but doesn't burst)\n\nOr: Powder quality worse than thought, very low effectiveness\n\nOr: Defender harassment highly effective, multiple crew casualties\n\nWhy it could happen: Wear and tear from campaign, bad powder batch, unusually skilled defenders\n\nConsequences: One gun out of action, reduced effectiveness, 3-5 day delay\n\nRealistic factors: Equipment is tired, operating at range limits\n\n9-20: SLOW PROGRESS (12% - Possible)\n\nBombardment proceeds but inefficiently\n\nWalls damaged but repairs keep pace\n\nWeather interference, mechanical issues slow operations\n\nAfter 1 week: Visible damage but no breach\n\nTimeline estimate: 3-4 weeks to create viable breach\n\nWhy it happens: Combination of minor problems, strong walls, effective repairs\n\nGarrison response: Morale holds, they see walls withstanding\n\nRealistic factors: Fortresses were built to resist - this is within normal range\n\n21-45: STANDARD SIEGE PROGRESS (25% - Likely)\n\nBombardment effective but not exceptional\n\nWalls taking steady damage, repairs struggle to keep up\n\nSome sections weakening notably by end of week one\n\nAfter 1 week: Significant damage, breach forming\n\nAfter 2 weeks: Viable breach, walls compromised\n\nTimeline estimate: 10-16 days to create assault-worthy breach\n\nWhy it happens: Professional execution, fortress resistance within expected parameters\n\nGarrison response: Morale declining as walls fail, may negotiate after breach forms\n\nRealistic factors: This is what typically happened in historical sieges with adequate artillery\n\n46-70: GOOD PROGRESS (25% - Likely)\n\nBombardment more effective than expected\n\nTwo-point strategy working well, defenders struggle to manage repairs\n\nWalls show serious damage by day 5-6\n\nAfter 1 week: Multiple weak points, one section near breach\n\nAfter 10-12 days: Clear breach, walls critically compromised\n\nTimeline estimate: 8-12 days to viable breach\n\nWhy it happens: Calabrese's skill, good preparation pays off, walls less resistant than expected\n\nGarrison response: Morale problems visible, possible surrender offers before assault\n\nRealistic factors: Upper end of typical performance with professional artillery\n\n71-85: EXCELLENT PROGRESS (15% - Possible)\n\nBombardment highly effective from start\n\nWalls poorly maintained or weaker than they appeared\n\nCalabrese finds optimal firing positions, crews perform excellently\n\nAfter 4-5 days: Major section of wall visibly crumbling\n\nAfter 7-8 days: Breach viable for assault\n\nTimeline estimate: 6-9 days to viable breach\n\nWhy it happens: Everything goes right - skill, luck, enemy weakness\n\nGarrison response: Serious surrender negotiations likely around day 5-6\n\nRealistic factors: Possible with combination of competence and fortune\n\n86-93: RAPID BREACH (8% - Unlikely but Possible)\n\nWalls have hidden structural weakness (poor foundations, earlier earthquake damage, etc.)\n\nFirst day's bombardment reveals critical vulnerability\n\nAfter 3-4 days: Section of wall collapses dramatically\n\nAfter 5-6 days: Multiple breach points, walls failing\n\nTimeline estimate: 4-6 days to viable breach\n\nWhy it happens: Hidden weakness exploited, cascading failure of wall structure\n\nGarrison response: Panic visible, likely surrender offer by day 4-5 to avoid sack\n\nRealistic factors: Rare but historical - sometimes walls had unknown vulnerabilities\n\n94-97: PSYCHOLOGICAL COLLAPSE (4% - Unlikely)\n\nBombardment effective AND garrison morale breaks\n\nFactional tensions inside fortress (Berber/Granadan) explode under stress\n\nAfter 2-3 days: White flags appear, surrender negotiations begin\n\nFighting may be visible inside fortress between factions\n\nWhy it happens: Bombardment triggers existing tensions, one faction wants to surrender\n\nGarrison response: Internal civil conflict, possible coup against commander\n\nRealistic factors: Links to earlier evidence of factional problems\n\n98-99: COMMANDER OFFERS TERMS (2% - Very Unlikely)\n\nAfter 1-2 days of bombardment, commander sends envoys\n\nOffers negotiated surrender to avoid destruction\n\n\"Honorable resistance shown, now let us be reasonable\"\n\nMay request terms: Safe passage, conversion with honors, vassalage\n\nWhy it happens: Pragmatic commander sees inevitability, wants to save lives/fortress\n\nGarrison response: Mixed - some support, others feel betrayed\n\nRealistic factors: Rare but some medieval commanders were pragmatic\n\n100: IMMEDIATE DRAMATIC EFFECT (1% - Very Rare)\n\nFirst day's bombardment causes major structural collapse\n\nTower falls, wall section collapses, or massive breach opens immediately\n\nVisible panic inside fortress\n\nWhite flags within 24-48 hours\n\nWhy it happens: Extraordinary luck hitting exact weak point, catastrophic structural failure\n\nGarrison response: Terror and immediate surrender to avoid sack\n\nRealistic factors: Exceedingly rare but occasionally happened in history\n\nProbability Summary:\n\nMajor Problems (1-8): 8% - Unlikely\n\nSlow/Normal Progress (9-45): 37% - Most likely range\n\nGood Progress (46-70): 25% - Common\n\nExcellent Results (71-85): 15% - Possible\n\nExceptional Outcomes (86-100): 15% - Unlikely but possible\n\nMost Realistic Range: 21-70 (50%) - Standard to good siege progress taking 8-16 days\n\nExpected Timeline:\n\n50% chance: 8-16 days to viable breach\n\n25% chance: Slower (16-24 days)\n\n25% chance: Faster (4-10 days)\n\nReady for your roll when you are."

This is in the 86-93 range, which means:\n- Walls have hidden structural weakness\n- First day's bombardment reveals critical vulnerability\n- After 3-4 days: Section of wall collapses dramatically\n- After 5-6 days: Multiple breach points, walls failing\n- Timeline estimate: 4-6 days to viable breach\n- Garrison response: Panic visible, likely surrender offer by day 4-5 to avoid sack\n\nThis is unlikely but possible - sometimes walls had unknown vulnerabilities. I need to narrate this realistically:\n1. Show the bombardment beginning\n2. Reveal the hidden weakness (maybe earthquake damage, poor repairs, foundation issues)\n3. Show progressive collapse over 4-6 days\n4. Show garrison panic and eventual surrender offer\n5. Keep it realistic - not instant, but faster than expected\n\nThe user wants a week's worth of events. I should narrate the progression day by day, showing:\n- Day 1: Bombardment begins, first signs of unusual weakness\n- Day 2-3: Progressive damage revealing structural problems\n- Day 4: Major collapse\n- Day 5-6: Multiple breaches, garrison panic\n- Day 6-7: Surrender offer\n\nI need to stop before Juan accepts or rejects surrender terms - that's his decision.\n\nI should keep this relatively concise - probably 6-8 paragraphs covering the week. Don't drag it out too long. Focus on key moments and the progression.\n\nThe Week of Bombardment: May 30 - June 5, 1431\n\nThe bombardment begins on the morning of May 30th, just after dawn prayers. The Master of Calatrava sends your herald forward under white flag to deliver the formal surrender offer. The garrison commander appears on the walls—a gray-bearded man in fine armor—and listens to the terms. His response is brief and dignified: \"Tell your king we are men of faith and honor. We will defend what Allah has entrusted to us. Let him do his worst.\"\n\nThe herald returns. Calabrese raises his hand, then drops it.\n\nThe five bombards roar.\n\nThe sound is tremendous—a rolling thunder that echoes off the valley walls. You watch from your command position as the first stone balls arc through the morning air and slam into Loja's walls. Dust and stone chips fly. The defenders duck behind merlons. Calabrese's crews work with practiced efficiency, swabbing barrels, loading powder and shot, adjusting elevation. The rhythm settles into its pattern: boom, boom, boom—three guns at the main gate, two at the eastern wall. Six to eight shots per gun each day.\n\nBy afternoon of the first day, something becomes apparent.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Calabrese says, excitement barely contained in his professional tone. \"Look at the eastern wall, where we're hitting near the postern gate. See how the cracks spread? That's not normal. The masonry is... wrong somehow.\"\n\nYou study the wall through the dust. He's right. Each impact sends spider-web cracks spreading far beyond the strike point. By sunset, a section twenty feet wide shows visible damage from just a dozen hits.\n\nDay Two: May 31st\n\nThe bombardment resumes at dawn. The eastern wall section begins to sag visibly by mid-morning. Calabrese shifts one of his main gate guns to concentrate three bombards on this weakening section.\n\n\"Foundation problems, I think,\" he explains, studying the wall through a tube. \"See how it leans slightly outward? Something underneath is failing. Maybe earthquake damage from years ago, poorly repaired. Or the ground is shifting. Either way, we've found the weak point.\"\n\nBy day's end, the defenders have stopped trying to repair the eastern section. You can see them pulling back from that wall, moving supplies and positioning defenders elsewhere. They know.\n\nDay Three: June 1st\n\nThe morning bombardment seems almost routine now—except the eastern wall is visibly bulging outward. Cracks run from ground to battlements. Defenders watch nervously from adjacent towers.\n\nAt mid-afternoon, it happens.\n\nA single bombard shot strikes the wall about fifteen feet up. For a moment, nothing. Then a grinding, terrible sound—stone shifting against stone. A section thirty feet wide simply leans outward, slowly, almost gracefully, and collapses into a massive pile of rubble and dust. The crash echoes across the valley. Your men cheer.\n\nThe dust clears to reveal a gaping breach, easily fifty feet wide, with slopes of rubble leading up into the fortress interior. You can see buildings inside, people running.\n\nBut Calabrese isn't celebrating. \"Your Majesty, look at the adjacent sections. The collapse has destabilized them. The entire eastern curtain wall is compromised. If we keep firing...\"\n\nHe doesn't need to finish. You can see it—cracks spreading from the breach, other sections beginning to lean.\n\nDay Four: June 2nd\n\nThe bombardment continues, but now targeting the main gate and the walls on either side of yesterday's breach. The fortress is coming apart. By noon, another section near the postern gate collapses—smaller, but widening the breach further. Defenders are visible on the walls, arguing, gesturing. Some kind of heated discussion.\n\nDon Rodrigo's scouts report seeing people trying to leave through the north side of the fortress during the night—civilians, probably, fleeing before the walls come down completely.\n\nBy evening, nearly a hundred feet of the eastern defenses are rubble. The fortress is breached in multiple places. An assault would be costly but successful.\n\nDay Five: June 3rd\n\nYou wake to find a white flag flying over Loja's main gate.\n\nCalabrese suspends the bombardment. An hour later, envoys emerge—three men, the gray-bearded commander among them. They approach under the white flag, looking exhausted and dusty.\n\nThe commander bows stiffly. \"Your Majesty. I am Qaid Yusuf ibn Musa, commander of this fortress.\" His Castilian is accented but clear. \"I would speak with you about terms.\"\n\nHe gestures back at the shattered walls. \"As you can see, continued resistance is... inadvisable. The walls that we thought would hold for weeks have failed in days. Some of my men say it is Allah's judgment. Others say it is simply bad fortune and old damage. Either way, the result is the same. If you assault, you will take the fortress. Many will die on both sides. The town will be sacked.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"I would prefer to avoid such waste. I have eight hundred soldiers and perhaps two thousand civilians inside. If you will offer reasonable terms, I am prepared to discuss surrender.\"\n\nHe waits, the ruined fortress behind him, your five bombards silent but ready to resume.\n\nWhat terms do you offer?"

A pragmatic commander who already came to negotiate would likely accept. The quick collapse of the walls gives him justification (\"walls failed, further resistance pointless\"). The honorable departure with arms and colors saves face.\n\nHowever, there's still the factional tensions (Berbers vs. Granadans), religious considerations, and potential hardliners who want to fight.\n\nI'd estimate:\n- 70-80% chance of acceptance (these are excellent terms)\n- 10-15% chance of conditional negotiation (wants something more)\n- 10-15% chance of rejection or complications (hardliners, religious zealots, factional issues)\n\nLet me create the table:\n\nD100 Table: Qaid Yusuf's Response to Surrender Terms\n\nFactors Analysis:\n\nFAVORING ACCEPTANCE:\n\nTerms extremely generous by medieval standards (keeping arms and colors is rare honor)\n\nWalls destroyed in just 5 days - no military hope\n\nCommander already came to negotiate (pragmatic mindset)\n\nSafe conduct protects his men from death/slavery\n\nHis honor preserved - resisted properly, then accepted honorable terms\n\nAvoiding sack saves civilian lives\n\nNo forced conversions follows Islamic law (better than alternatives)\n\nQuick wall collapse gives him clear justification to his men\n\nAGAINST ACCEPTANCE:\n\nReligious duty to resist crusaders\n\nSome garrison may prefer martyrdom\n\nFactional tensions (Berbers vs. local Granadans) - different motivations\n\nHardliners may call him traitor\n\nCivilians staying means accepting Christian rule permanently\n\nDistrust of Christian promises despite papal prohibition\n\nSultan might execute him for surrendering\n\nSetting precedent - if Loja yields, other fortresses will too\n\nREALISTIC ASSESSMENT: \nThese are excellent terms that save lives and honor. A pragmatic commander who walked out to negotiate likely wants to accept.

Relief and gratitude for the generous terms\n2. Professional respect between commanders\n3. A reasonable, small request that helps him with his men\n4. Acknowledgment that Juan has been honorable\n\nKeep it in character - dignified, military professional, pragmatic but concerned with honor.\n\nQaid Yusuf listens to your terms with careful attention, his weathered face unreadable. When you finish, he's silent for a long moment, then exhales slowly—a sound that might be relief.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says, bowing more deeply than before. \"These terms are generous. More generous than I expected, and more than many of my men dared hope for.\" He glances back at the shattered walls. \"We have fought as honor demanded. You have shown why Allah grants victory—not through cruelty, but through strength tempered with mercy.\"\n\nHe pauses, then meets your eyes directly. \"I accept your terms, and I will recommend them to my captains and garrison. However...\" He chooses his words carefully. \"Your Majesty, I have eight hundred men behind those walls. Some are Granada locals who have fought Christians their whole lives. Others are Berbers from across the sea, who came for jihad. They are brave men, but proud, and some are... difficult.\"\n\nHe gestures toward the white flag above the gate. \"If I return and simply say 'we open the gates, lay down arms, and walk out,' there will be men who call me a coward. Who say I surrendered too quickly, that I betrayed them, that I should have fought to the last man.\" His jaw tightens. \"I know what military reality demands. They do not always think so clearly.\"\n\n\"So I ask this, Your Majesty: When we surrender the fortress, might we do so with ceremony? Let my men march out in formation, with our banners flying and weapons shouldered. Let us surrender the fortress keys to you personally at the gates, not simply leave them on a table. Let there be... formality. Dignity.\"\n\nHe holds your gaze. \"I need to show my men that we negotiated honorable terms with an honorable king. That we were defeated by a worthy opponent who respects the laws of war, not simply crushed like bandits. This will help me convince the hardliners. And it will help those who leave carry word to other fortresses that King Juan of Castile keeps his word and treats brave defenders with respect.\"\n\nHis voice softens slightly. \"Also, if you would be willing to provide the written safe-conduct in your own hand, sealed with your royal seal, I can show that to any of your patrols we might encounter on the road to Granada. It would prevent... misunderstandings.\"\n\nHe awaits your response. The requests cost you nothing of substance—a bit of ceremony, a written document. But you can see what they mean to him: the difference between \"we were forced to flee\" and \"we negotiated an honorable surrender with the King of Castile.\""

He'll accept, express gratitude, and depart to organize the surrender. \n\nI should:\n1. Have the Qaid accept gratefully\n2. Show his relief\n3. Have him depart to begin convincing his garrison\n4. Narrate the 3-day waiting period\n5. Describe the ceremonial surrender when it happens\n6. Show Juan taking possession of Loja\n7. End with status update\n\nThis is a significant moment - first major fortress taken by negotiation rather than assault. Should be treated with appropriate gravity and ceremony.\n\nQaid Yusuf's shoulders visibly relax. He bows deeply, touching his hand to his heart in the Moorish gesture of respect and gratitude. \"Your Majesty, you have my word. Three days will be sufficient.\" His voice carries genuine relief. \"I will return now and convene my captains. The ceremony you describe—it is exactly what we need. It allows my men to depart with dignity, and it shows all Granada that you are a king who values honor.\"\n\nHe pauses at the edge of the parley ground, turning back. \"Your Majesty, when word of this reaches other fortresses—and it will—they will know that resistance has its limits, but that honorable surrender meets with honorable treatment. You may find this makes your campaign easier.\" He bows again. \"Three days. You will have your keys.\"\n\nThe envoys withdraw. The white flag remains flying. Calabrese orders the guns to fall silent.\n\nThe Three Days of Waiting: June 3rd-5th\n\nThe camp settles into an odd quiet. The bombardment's thunder, which had become almost routine, is suddenly absent. Men speak in normal voices again. You can hear birds.\n\nDon Rodrigo's scouts report constant activity inside Loja—meetings visible in the courtyard, heated discussions on the walls, people moving supplies. On the second day, a small group of civilians emerges from the north gate carrying bundles—perhaps fifty people, mostly elderly and women with children. They're allowed to pass through your lines without interference, heading north toward Granada.\n\n\"Families who don't trust Christian rule,\" the Master of Calatrava observes. \"Better they leave peacefully now than cause problems later.\"\n\nFray Hernando says Mass each morning in the camp, prayers of thanksgiving for the victory won without excessive bloodshed. The mood among your troops is excellent—a major fortress taken in less than a week, and without a costly assault.\n\nOn the evening of the third day, messengers emerge from Loja. The surrender ceremony will be tomorrow at noon.\n\nThe Surrender: June 6th, 1431 (Midday)\n\nYou dress in your finest—the armor you wore to Rome, polished to a gleam, your father's sword Non Nobis Domine at your hip, the white crusader's cloak bearing the red cross. The True Cross fragment hangs around your neck. Behind you, the Master of Calatrava, Infante Enrique, Don Fadrique, and your senior commanders form in full panoply. Your entire army—nearly nineteen thousand men—arrays in formation across the valley, banners flying.\n\nThe guns sit silent on their positions, aimed at Loja but cold.\n\nAt noon precisely, Loja's main gate opens.\n\nA column of soldiers marches out in perfect formation. Eight hundred men in their armor and robes, weapons on shoulders, carrying their green banners. They move with discipline despite the defeat—heads high, step measured. Qaid Yusuf rides at their head on a gray horse, the fortress keys hanging from a chain around his neck.\n\nThey form up fifty yards from your position. The garrison faces your army. For a long moment, nineteen hundred stand opposite eight hundred in absolute silence.\n\nQaid Yusuf dismounts. He walks forward alone, removes the chain from his neck, and approaches. Twenty paces away, he kneels on one knee—not full prostration, but respectful acknowledgment of defeat.\n\n\"Your Majesty, King Juan of Castile,\" his voice carries in the stillness. \"I, Qaid Yusuf ibn Musa, commander of the fortress of Loja, do hereby surrender this stronghold into your hands. We have fought as honor demanded. You have proven stronger. I deliver to you these keys, and with them the fortress, its garrison, and its people. I ask that you remember your word—safe passage for my soldiers, and protection for those civilians who remain.\"\n\nHe holds out the keys.\n\nYou step forward and take them—heavy iron, ancient, warm from hanging against his chest. You hand them immediately to a page, then produce the document you had prepared: a letter of safe-conduct written in your hand on parchment, sealed with your royal seal, promising safe passage through Castilian territory to any man bearing it.\n\n\"Qaid Yusuf ibn Musa,\" your voice carries across both formations. \"You have defended your post with courage and honor. I accept your surrender and pledge before God Almighty that every promise I made shall be kept. Your men may depart with their arms and colors. Those who remain shall be protected by the laws of Castile and the commands of Holy Church. No man shall be forced to convert. No civilian shall be harmed. This I swear before Christ and all the saints.\"\n\nYou extend the document. He rises, takes it with both hands, bows deeply.\n\n\"Your Majesty honors his word. May Allah—may God—bless you for your mercy.\"\n\nHe turns to his men, raising the document high so they can see the seal. \"We depart with honor! Remember this day—we faced King Juan of Castile, and he proved a worthy opponent!\" A ragged cheer rises from the Moorish troops—not celebration, but acknowledgment. Pride in having fought well, relief at surviving.\n\nThe garrison forms up again. They march north in column, banners still flying, weapons still carried. Your men part to let them through. Some of your soldiers nod respectfully—warrior to warrior. The Moors disappear up the northern road toward Granada.\n\nTaking Possession\n\nYou ride through Loja's shattered eastern wall with your commanders. The town is quiet—perhaps fifteen hundred civilians remain, watching nervously from doorways and windows. The mosque stands in the central square, its minaret rising above the rooftops. Buildings are intact—the rapid surrender preserved the town from sack.\n\nCaptain Fernán immediately posts guards at key points, orders against looting announced loudly in the streets. The Master of Calatrava begins organizing the garrison—you'll need at least five hundred men to hold this place.\n\nFray Hernando approaches the mosque. \"Your Majesty, shall we reconsecrate it today, or wait?\"\n\nThe civilians watch. Some are weeping quietly. Others simply look exhausted. A few older men approach hesitantly—community leaders, perhaps, wanting to know what comes next.\n\nStatus Summary:\n\nDate: June 6, 1431 (Evening)\n\nMilitary Victory:\n\nLoja captured after 7 days (3 days preparation, 3 days bombardment, 1 day surrender)\n\nNo Castilian casualties beyond minor harrassment from walls\n\nEnemy garrison of 800 released unharmed\n\nAll five bombards operational and ready to move\n\nTerritory Controlled:\n\nAlcalá la Real (March 26 capture)\n\nÍllora (April 14 capture)\n\nLoja (June 6 capture)\n\nWestern Coast: Vélez-Málaga, Nerja\n\nForces:\n\nEastern Army: ~18,870 men (at Loja)\n\nWestern Army: ~12,000 men (coastal operations)\n\nTotal: ~30,870 troops\n\nStrategic Situation:\n\nMajor fortress fallen with minimal cost\n\nPrecedent set: honorable resistance meets honorable terms\n\nRoute to Málaga now more open\n\nWord will spread quickly through Granada\n\nImmediate Decisions Needed:\n\nReconsecrate mosque immediately or wait?\n\nGarrison size for Loja?\n\nNext target?

          "text": "You decide quickly on the key matters. The mosque can wait for formal reconsecration—there will be time for proper ceremony later, and forcing it immediately would inflame the remaining civilians unnecessarily. Post guards to prevent vandalism, but leave it standing for now.\n\nFor the garrison, you assign six hundred men—sufficient to hold the fortress and maintain order, but not so many that it weakens your field army. Don García López de Padilla, your reliable vanguard commander, receives the post. \"Keep order, protect the civilians, begin repairs on the eastern wall. I'll send supply trains from Alcalá.\"\n\nThe remaining civilians—perhaps fifteen hundred souls—watch nervously as your soldiers take positions. You issue clear orders through interpreters: no forced conversions, no looting, protection for those who remain peacefully. Property rights will be respected. Anyone who wishes to leave for Granada may do so. The terror in their faces eases slightly, though trust will take time.\n\nCalabrese's crews spend June 7th breaking down the bombards for transport, a massive undertaking involving dozens of oxen and specially reinforced wagons. \"Málaga next, Your Majesty?\" the Italian asks with a satisfied grin. \"Now that will be a proper siege. A real city, not just a fortress town.\"\n\nThe March West: June 8th-14th\n\nYour army departs Loja on June 8th, nearly eighteen thousand men strong after leaving the garrison. The route west takes you through rough country—the mountains between Loja and the coast are not easy terrain for an army, especially one hauling five massive bombards.\n\nThe march takes six days. The weather holds—hot but clear, good for campaigning. Your scouts range ahead, Don Rodrigo's men probing for ambushes or guerrilla forces. They encounter only light harassment—a few arrow volleys from distant ridges, quickly driven off. Granada's field forces remain shattered from the battle at the capital's gates. Their guerrilla fighters seem cautious now, unwilling to face organized resistance.\n\nWord spreads ahead of you. Villages empty as you approach—civilians fleeing to Málaga or into the mountains. You pass abandoned farms, crops growing wild. The countryside feels hollow, waiting.\n\nOn June 12th, you receive messengers from Don Álvaro de Estúñiga's western army. They've been holding position along the coast, conducting minor raids but avoiding major operations while awaiting your arrival. Estúñiga himself rides out to meet you on June 13th, his force of twelve thousand joining yours in a broad valley ten miles northeast of Málaga.\n\nThe reunion is jubilant—your two armies, separated since early May, are finally united. Combined strength: over thirty thousand men. The largest Castilian army in generations.\n\nBefore Málaga: June 14th, 1431 (Evening)\n\nYou make camp on the hills overlooking Málaga. The city sprawls below you in the evening light—a proper city, not a fortress town. Perhaps twenty thousand inhabitants. Strong walls encircle the urban core, with the great Alcazaba fortress rising on a hill within the city itself, and the Gibralfaro castle perched even higher on the mountain above. Two fortresses, one city, all heavily defended.\n\nThe Mediterranean glitters beyond. Málaga's harbor sits protected by walls and towers. Ships bob at anchor—merchant vessels, fishing boats, and what look like several war galleys. The city hasn't closed itself off yet, but your arrival will change that.\n\nDon Álvaro approaches your command tent as the sun sets. \"Your Majesty, Málaga is no Loja. This will take weeks, perhaps months. They have supplies from the sea, strong defenses, and twenty thousand people to draw defenders from. But...\" He grins. \"We have thirty thousand men and those beautiful bombards. They'll fall eventually.\"\n\nMaster Calabrese is already surveying positions for the guns, muttering in Italian about angles and fields of fire.\n\nThe campaign's next great test lies ahead. Málaga—gateway to Granada's western territories, vital port, second city of the emirate after Granada itself. Take this, and the Sultan's coastal supply lines are severed.\n\nEND OF CHAPTER 20 - STATUS UPDATE\n\nDate: June 14, 1431 (Evening)\nLocation: Hills northeast of Málaga\n\nMilitary Forces - Combined Army\n\nTotal Strength: ~30,270 combat-effective troops\n\nComposition:\n\nEastern Army: ~18,270 (after Loja garrison deducted)\n\nWestern Army: ~12,000 (including coastal garrisons)\n\nInfantry: ~19,200\n\nCavalry: ~11,070\n\nArtillery: 5 medium bombards (operational, crews experienced)\n\nGarrisons Established:\n\nAlcalá la Real: 1,500 men\n\nÍllora: 800 men\n\nLoja: 600 men\n\nVélez-Málaga: 2,800 men\n\nNerja: 500 men\n\nTotal in garrisons: 6,200 men\n\nTerritory Controlled\n\nEastern Route:\n\nAlcalá la Real (captured March 26)\n\nÍllora (captured April 14)\n\nLoja (captured June 6)\n\nWestern Coast (20 miles secured):\n\nVélez-Málaga (captured late April)\n\nNerja (captured May 10)\n\nStrategic Position:\n\nTwo major routes into Granada secured\n\nArmies now united before Málaga\n\nSupply lines from Jaén and Seville functional\n\nRecent Victories\n\nLoja (May 30 - June 6):\n\nRapid breach after 3 days bombardment\n\nHonorable surrender negotiated\n\n800-man garrison released with arms\n\nZero assault casualties\n\nPrecedent set: honor in resistance, mercy in surrender\n\nPrevious Major Victories:\n\nBattle of Granada's Gates (May 10): Enemy sortie destroyed, 580 prisoners\n\nDevastation of Vega (May 11): Economic damage to Granada\n\nAlcalá la Real (March): First major fortress taken\n\nKey Personnel - Current Locations\n\nWith Juan at Málaga:\n\nMaster of Calatrava (senior military commander)\n\nDon Álvaro de Estúñiga (western army commander, now rejoined)\n\nDon Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza (heavy cavalry)\n\nInfante Enrique (tactical command)\n\nMaster Gunner Pietro Calabrese (artillery)\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea (scouts and intelligence)\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso de Robles (royal guard)\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont (military advisor)\n\nMarco Tornesi (crusader forces)\n\nFray Hernando (royal chaplain)\n\nGarrison Commands:\n\nDon García López de Padilla: Loja garrison (600 men)\n\nVarious commanders: Alcalá, Íllora, coastal fortresses\n\nElsewhere:\n\nQueen Isabel: Jaén or Toledo (pregnant, ~4 months)\n\nAhmad al-Zarqali (now Fernando): Rome embassy with Fray Hernando (departed late April)\n\nÁlvaro de Luna: Kingdom administration (Toledo/Seville)\n\nSacred Relics - Located in Jaén\n\nNOT with the army, secured in Jaén:\n\nFragment of the True Cross\n\nBone of Santiago (Saint James)\n\nWhite crusader banner\n\n(Father's sword Non Nobis Domine - with Juan)\n\nStrategic Situation\n\nStrengths:\n\nLargest Castilian army assembled\n\nThree fortresses captured in three months\n\nMálaga now isolated from eastern Granada\n\nGranada's field army shattered\n\nPrecedent of honorable surrender established\n\nExcellent artillery capability\n\nChallenges:\n\nMálaga much larger than previous targets\n\nCity has sea access for resupply\n\nTwo fortress systems (Alcazaba + Gibralfaro)\n\nLong siege likely (weeks to months)\n\nSummer heat intensifying\n\nGranada may send relief force\n\nArmy provisions need steady supply\n\nNext Objective: Siege of Málaga - second city of Granada, vital port, heavily fortified\n\nTimeline Summary\n\nMarch 26: Alcalá la Real falls\n\nApril 14: Íllora captured\n\nMay 10: Battle at Granada's gates - sortie destroyed\n\nMay 11: Vega devastated\n\nMay 29: Army arrives at Loja\n\nMay 30-June 2: Bombardment reveals weak wall\n\nJune 3: Wall collapses, surrender negotiations begin\n\nJune 6: Formal surrender ceremony, Loja secured\n\nJune 8-13: March west through mountains\n\nJune 14: Armies unite before Málaga\n\nCampaign Assessment\n\nProgress: Excellent. Three months, three fortresses, minimal casualties, growing reputation for honorable treatment of surrendered garrisons.

Success here could break Granada's will. Failure or excessive cost could stall campaign momentum.\n\nThe Summer Ahead: June through September good campaign weather. Málaga siege could extend through July-August. If successful, autumn might see push toward Granada city itself, or consolidation of gains.\n\nEND OF CHAPTER 20\n\nThe siege of Málaga awaits.

Let me check what other files exist that might track actual campaign progress.\n\nActually, looking at the instructions again, the user said \"Update the campaign status document\" - but I should clarify which document they mean. Is it:\n1. This budget document (Campaign_Budget_for_the_Granada_Crusade_-_1431_Season.md)\n2. Or perhaps there should be a new section added to this document tracking actual vs. planned?\n3. Or is there a different \"campaign status\" document I should create or update?\n\nLet me ask for clarification to make sure I update the right thing in the right way.\n\nNow I see the file. This is the campaign budget/planning document from January 1431.\n\nBefore I update it, I want to clarify: Do you want me to:\n\nAdd a new section at the end tracking actual campaign progress against the budget (like \"SECTION X: ACTUAL CAMPAIGN PROGRESS - APRIL-JUNE 1431\")?\n\nUpdate existing sections to reflect actual outcomes versus projections?\n\nCreate a separate campaign tracking document that references this budget?\n\nI want to make sure I update it in the format you're expecting. What would be most useful for you?"

Let me view that file first to understand its structure, then compile a changelog of what needs to be updated based on Chapter 20's events.\n\nLet me view the character tracker first.\n\nAh! My apologies for the confusion. Yes, I can update the CASTILE_CHARACTER_TRACKER.md file. Let me first view it to see its current state, then compile a changelog of what needs to be updated based on Chapter 20's events.\n\nGood! Now I can see the character tracker. It's last updated at the end of Chapter 18 (Mid-April 1431). Chapter 20 ends on June 14, 1431, so I need to update based on events from Chapters 19 and 20.\n\nLet me compile a changelog of what needs to be updated:\n\nFrom Chapter 19 and 20:\n1. **Update header**: Change \"End of Chapter 18 (Mid-April 1431)\" to \"End of Chapter 20 (Mid-June 1431)\"\n\n2. **Juan II**: \n   - Location: AlcalÃ¡ la Real → Málaga (besieging)\n   - Current Task: Update to reflect current campaign status\n   - Add key facts about battle at Granada's gates, Vega devastation, Loja siege victory\n\n3. **Isabel**: \n   - She's pregnant (~4 months by June)\n   - Location needs clarification (Jaén or Toledo - not with army)\n\n4. **Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles**:\n   - Location confirmed: With Juan at Málaga\n   - Current task: Royal guard command\n\n5. **Captain Rodrigo**:\n   - Still with Juan\n   - Location: Málaga\n\n6. **Sergeant García**:\n   - Still with Juan\n   - Location: Málaga\n\n7. **Sir Thomas Beaumont**:\n   - Location: Málaga with Juan\n\n8. **Marco Tornesi**:\n   - Location: Málaga with crusader forces\n\n9. **Master of Calatrava**:\n   - Location: AlcalÃ¡ → Málaga\n   - Update: Confidence restored after Granada victory\n   - Task: Senior military commander\n\n10. **Master of Santiago**:\n   - Location: Málaga with eastern army\n\n11. **Infante Enrique**:\n   - Location: Málaga\n   - Task: Tactical commander, led reserve forces in Granada battle\n\n12. **Fray Hernando**:\n   - LEFT for Rome embassy with Ahmad (departed late April)\n   - Location: En route to Rome or in Rome\n   - Task: Rome embassy with Ahmad/Fernando\n\n13. **Master Gunner Pietro Calabrese**:\n   - Location: Málaga\n   - Task: Artillery operations\n   - Update: Successfully breached Loja in record time\n\nI'll continue tracking the character details, focusing on their current locations and key roles during this critical military campaign. The updates reflect the dynamic military and diplomatic landscape of mid-1431.\n\nDon Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza appears to be a heavy cavalry commander with significant strategic importance in the Granada battle. His tactical positioning could be crucial for the overall military operation.\n\nDon García López de Padilla commands the Loja garrison, managing 600 troops and overseeing critical defensive infrastructure by repairing city walls. His defensive strategy seems essential to maintaining the city's strategic integrity.\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea operates as a critical intelligence asset, conducting scout missions and uncovering significant battlefield intelligence, specifically identifying Berber and Granadan casualties.\n\nDon Álvaro de Estúñiga has rejoined the western army in Málaga, resuming his role as the western army's commander and potentially coordinating broader military movements.\n\nAhmad al-Zarqali, now known as Fernando after conversion, is traveling to Rome with Fray Hernando on a diplomatic embassy to the Pope, representing a significant religious and political transition.\n\nQaid Yusuf ibn Musa, the former Loja commander, has surrendered with honor and is currently escorting 800 men to Granada, indicating a peaceful transition and potential diplomatic negotiations.\n\nThe Granada section reveals a massive defeat for Sultan Muhammad IX at the city gates, with Íllora still held by Muhammad al-Rashid, suggesting ongoing territorial conflicts.\n\nThe Crusade's status shows unified armies in Málaga, with updated force compositions, battle outcomes, and territorial control. Loja's status and casualty figures have been incorporated into the broader strategic assessment.\n\nSacred items are confirmed to be located in Jaén, separate from the main military force, ensuring their protection and potential symbolic significance.\n\nPerfect! Now I understand. Let me compile a changelog for the CASTILE_CHARACTER_TRACKER.md file based on Chapter 20 events:\n\nPROPOSED CHANGELOG FOR CHARACTER TRACKER\n\nUpdates from Chapter 20 (End of Chapter 18 → End of Chapter 20)\n\nHEADER:\n\nChange \"Last Updated: End of Chapter 18 (Mid-April 1431)\" → \"Last Updated: End of Chapter 20 (Mid-June 1431)\"\n\nJUAN II:\n\nLocation: \"AlcalÃ¡ la Real\" → \"Hills northeast of Málaga (besieging)\"\n\nCurrent Task: Update to \"Besieging Málaga with combined 30,000-man army\"\n\nAdd Key Facts:\nBattle of Granada's Gates (May 10, 1431) - destroyed enemy sortie, 580 prisoners\n\nOrdered devastation of Vega (May 11) - economic warfare\n\nCaptured Loja after 7-day siege (June 6) with rapid bombardment\n\nNegotiated honorable surrender with Qaid Yusuf\n\nISABEL OF PORTUGAL:\n\nAdd Key Fact: Pregnant (~4 months as of June 1431)\n\nLocation: \"AlcalÃ¡ with Juan's forces\" → \"Jaén or Toledo (safe location, not with army)\"\n\nCurrent Task: Update to \"Managing household;

But when opened in Excel or some spreadsheet programs, they default to a different encoding (like Windows-1252 or Latin-1)\n3. This causes characters like \"Ã\" to appear instead of proper Spanish characters\n\nSolutions I can consider:\n\n**Option 1: Add UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark)**\n- Add the UTF-8 BOM at the start of the file\n- This helps Excel automatically detect UTF-8 encoding\n- Simple fix, maintains all special characters\n\n**Option 2: Use Latin-1/Windows-1252 encoding**\n- Save with a different encoding that Excel handles better by default\n- Should work for Spanish characters\n\n**Option 3: Replace special characters with ASCII alternatives**\n- á → a, é → e, í → i, ó → o, ú → u, ñ → n\n- Simplifies but loses linguistic accuracy\n- User said \"simplify if needed\" so this might be what they want\n\n**Option 4: Create both versions**\n- One with proper Spanish characters (UTF-8 with BOM)\n- One simplified ASCII-only version\n\nI should ask the user which approach they prefer before redrafting. The user explicitly said \"tell me what you think first\" so I should present options.\n\nMost likely the best approach is:\n1. First try UTF-8 with BOM (fixes the encoding issue while keeping proper Spanish)\n2. If that doesn't work for their system, offer a simplified ASCII version\n\nLet me present these options clearly.\n\nGood catch! This is a common character encoding issue. Here are the options I'm thinking about:\n\nThe Problem:\n\nSpanish characters like á, é, í, ó, ú, ñ are showing up as garbled text (probably something like Ã¡, Ã©, etc.) when you open the CSV in Excel or another program.\n\nPossible Solutions:\n\nOption 1: Add UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) - Recommended first try\n\nThis tells Excel/spreadsheet programs to use UTF-8 encoding automatically\n\nKeeps all proper Spanish characters (Álvaro, Jaén, Hernando, etc.)\n\nShould fix the display issue without losing linguistic accuracy\n\nSimple technical fix\n\nOption 2: Simplify to ASCII characters - If Option 1 doesn't work for you\n\nReplace all special characters with plain English equivalents:\ná, é, í, ó, ú → a, e, i, o, u\n\nñ → n\n\nExample: \"Álvaro de Luna\" → \"Alvaro de Luna\"\n\n\"Jaén\" → \"Jaen\"\n\n100% compatibility with any system\n\nLoses some linguistic authenticity but everything will display correctly\n\nMy Recommendation:\nTry Option 1 first (UTF-8 with BOM). This should fix your display issue while keeping the proper Spanish spelling. If that still doesn't work on your system, I can quickly create Option 2 (simplified ASCII version).\n\nWhich would you prefer?"

Option 1 is something I would do when I recreate the CSV file.\n\nIt's a simple change in how I write the file - I just need to add a special marker (the BOM) at the very beginning of the file that tells Excel and other programs \"hey, this file uses UTF-8 encoding, so display the special characters correctly.\"\n\nIt's literally one small code change on my end when I generate the file.

If that happens:\n\nWhen importing/opening, manually select UTF-8 as the encoding\n\nIn Excel: Data → Get Data → From Text/CSV → select file → change encoding to \"UTF-8\"\n\nIn Google Sheets: File → Import → Upload → it should auto-detect UTF-8\n\nIf even that doesn't work:\nThen we know Option 1 isn't compatible with your setup, and I'll immediately create Option 2 (simplified ASCII - no special encoding needed, works everywhere).\n\nSo to summarize: Try just opening it normally first. The BOM should handle it automatically. Only if it still looks wrong would you need to manually select UTF-8, and if that fails too, then we go with the simplified version.\n\nWant me to create the UTF-8 with BOM version now?"

But it seems like the character didn't get replaced properly, and then when writing with ASCII encoding and errors='replace', the unrecognized character got turned into ??.\n\nLet me look at what I did:\n1. I read the file with UTF-8 encoding - that's correct\n2. I tried to simplify text with replacements\n3. But then I wrote with ASCII encoding and errors='replace' - which means any character that couldn't be encoded as ASCII would be replaced with ?\n\nThe problem is likely that my simplify_text() function didn't catch all the special characters, OR there's something about how Python is handling the character encoding.\n\nLooking at the output, it shows \"Ãlvaro de Luna\" in the sample - that's the mojibake version that appears when UTF-8 text is read as Latin-1 or CP1252. But I read it as UTF-8...\n\nWait, I think the issue is that the markdown file itself might have some encoding issues already from the previous updates I made. When I used sed commands earlier, I might have created encoding problems.\n\nLet me verify by checking the actual file encoding and then rewrite the CSV generation to be more robust.\n\nI should:\n1. Read the file and check what's actually in there\n2. Apply more comprehensive character replacement\n3. Make sure I'm handling all the edge cases\n\nLet me tell the user what happened and offer to fix it.\n\nYou're absolutely right to be confused! This is my mistake. Let me explain what went wrong:\n\nThe Problem:\n\nWhen I created the CSV, some characters were already garbled in the source file (from my earlier edits using command-line tools), and my character replacement function didn't catch them properly. So when I wrote the file as ASCII with errors='replace', any character it couldn't encode became ??.\n\nIt's a double encoding problem:\n\nSome characters were already corrupted from my previous updates\n\nMy simplification function didn't handle the corrupted versions\n\nASCII encoding replaced the unrecognized characters with ??\n\nThe Fix:\n\nI need to:\n\nRead the original markdown file more carefully\n\nHandle BOTH the corrupted characters (like Ã) AND the proper special characters (like á)\n\nDo a more thorough cleanup before writing to CSV\n\nShould I regenerate the CSV file with a more robust character cleaning process? This should properly convert:\n\nÁlvaro → Alvaro\n\nJaén → Jaen\n\nHernando → Hernando\n\netc.\n\nI'll make sure to catch all the weird character combinations this time. Want me to try again?"
