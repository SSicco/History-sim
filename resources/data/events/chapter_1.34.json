          "text": "Perfect. I now have a clear picture. We're at February 27, 1432, evening. Juan is departing tomorrow (February 28) for Seville to campaign against the rebel nobles. Isabel is one month post-partum, recovering from the traumatic birth. She had a dangerous infection that took weeks to break, but she's now on the mend. Baby Catalina is one month old, healthy and thriving.\n\nQueen Leonor of Portugal (Isabel's mother) is en route and will arrive 4-5 days after Juan's departure.\n\nThis is their last evening together before he leaves for what will be about a 2-month campaign. They're in a much better place than they were - Isabel has recovered significantly, Catalina is healthy, and they've been together for about a month since the birth crisis.\n\nJuan is visiting Isabel before he leaves tomorrow. I should create an intimate, tender scene. They've just been through a life-threatening crisis together, and now he's leaving again for military operations. This is about saying goodbye, about their relationship, about the balance between duty and family.\n\nI should keep this SHORT during the conversation - maybe 3-4 paragraphs, then stop for Juan's response.\n\nCHAPTER 34: FAREWELL AND DEPARTURE\n\nFebruary 27, 1432 - Evening\n\nToledo Alcázar\n\nThe royal chambers are quiet save for the crackling fire and Catalina's soft breathing from her cradle near the hearth. Isabel sits in the cushioned chair by the Portuguese chapel corner, the Virgin Mary gazing down with painted serenity. She's dressed in a simple blue gown, her dark hair loose around her shoulders—still thinner than before the birth, but color has returned to her face. One month of recovery shows in the way she moves now without wincing, though she still tires easily.\n\nWhen you enter, she looks up and smiles, but there's sadness in her eyes. \"I knew you'd come tonight,\" she says softly. \"Our last evening before you leave for Seville.\"\n\nDoña Beatriz curtsies and withdraws, pulling the door nearly closed behind her but remaining in the anteroom as propriety demands. Isabel gestures to the chair beside hers. \"Sit with me? Catalina just fed and should sleep a few hours. We can actually talk.\"\n\nShe reaches for your hand, lacing her fingers through yours. \"I've been thinking about what to say all day, and now... I'm not sure where to begin.\""

According to the project files, Queen Leonor of Portugal is en route and will arrive 4-5 days after Juan's departure.\n\nIsabel is recovering from the traumatic childbirth one month ago. She's getting stronger but still fragile. This is their first real separation since Catalina's birth, and Juan will be gone for about 2 months on the rebel campaign.\n\nI need to show Isabel's response to Juan's reassurance. She's probably:\n- Grateful for his words but still anxious about the separation\n- Worried about him going into danger again (she always worries when he campaigns)\n- Trying to be strong and supportive as a queen should be\n- Emotional because this is their last night together for months\n- Conflicted between wanting him to stay safe and understanding his duty\n\nKeep the response SHORT (2-4 paragraphs) since this is active dialogue. Stop and wait for Juan's next response. Don't write what Juan says or does beyond what the player stated.\n\nIsabel leans into the kiss, her hand coming up to touch your face briefly before you pull back. She tries to smile at your reassurance, but her eyes glisten.\n\n\"I know we'll be alright,\" she says quietly. \"And yes, Mother will be here in just a few days—I'm counting them. It will be such a relief to have her here, especially with Catalina.\" She glances at the cradle where your daughter sleeps peacefully. \"But Juan...\"\n\nHer grip on your hand tightens. \"It's you I worry about. Not us here in Toledo, safe behind these walls. You're riding to war again. Against Castilian nobles this time, not Moors, but still—sieges, battles, men who might resist desperately.\" Her voice drops to almost a whisper. \"Last time you left, you rode alone to Ronda's gates in white armor. You trusted God and it worked, but I was terrified when I heard. And now you're leaving again, and I...\"\n\nShe stops herself, taking a breath. \"I'm sorry. I promised myself I wouldn't do this tonight. You have duties. The rebels must be dealt with. The realm requires it. I understand all of that.\" But tears slip down her cheeks despite her words. \"I just need you to promise me you'll come back. That you'll be careful. That you won't take unnecessary risks.\"\n\nShe looks up at you, vulnerable and afraid. \"Can you promise me that?\""

This is a gentle redirection but also a bit dismissive of her very real fears. She's 16, recently nearly died in childbirth, and her husband is going off to war again. Her worries are legitimate.\n\nHowever, this is also Juan trying to be reassuring in his way, and trying to redirect her maternal instincts toward their daughter. Isabel is devout and loves Juan deeply - she will try to accept what he's saying, but she can't just turn off her fear.\n\nI should show:\n1. Isabel trying to accept his words\n2. But also the reality that she can't simply stop worrying\n3. Her understanding of his faith and trust in God\n4. Her struggle between being a supportive wife and a frightened young woman\n5. Her agreement to focus on Catalina, but the worry won't go away\n\nThis should be short - just her response to what he's said. Stop after she responds so the player can continue the conversation.\n\nIsabel wipes at her tears, managing a small, shaky laugh. \"Worry too much? Perhaps. But loving you and worrying about you seem to come together, Juan. I don't know how to separate them.\"\n\nShe's quiet for a moment, looking down at your joined hands. When she speaks again, her voice is softer, more controlled. \"You're right, though. Catalina must be my first concern. She needs me here, strong and present, not consumed with fears about things I cannot control.\" She takes a deep breath. \"And you're right about God's plan. You've taught me that—shown me through your actions. At Ronda, at Alcalá, every time you've trusted completely and God has protected you.\"\n\nShe looks up at you again, and though tears still glisten in her eyes, there's something steadier in her expression now. \"I can do that. I promise. Catalina first. She'll need all my attention, especially with you gone.\" A pause. \"But Juan... I cannot promise not to worry about you at all. That's asking me not to love you. And I do love you—so much it frightens me sometimes.\"\n\nShe lifts your hand to her lips, kisses it gently. \"I'll pray for you every day. Morning and evening, at the chapel. For your safety, for wisdom in dealing with the rebels, for swift victory and your quick return. That much I can do.\"\n\nHer eyes search yours. \"Is that enough?\""

At one month old, she's grown noticeably—nearly ten pounds now, her face filling out, dark hair beginning to show more clearly. You settle her against your shoulder with practiced ease, and she nestles there instinctively, her tiny fist curling against your neck.\n\nAs you walk slowly around the chamber, speaking softly to your daughter, Isabel follows you with her eyes. There's such tenderness in her expression—watching you hold Catalina, hearing you talk to her about leaving, about her mother's worries.\n\n\"You're so natural with her,\" Isabel says quietly from her chair. \"I worried you might not... that kings don't...\" She trails off, then tries again. \"My father never held me like that. Never walked around talking to me. Royal children were brought to him when summoned, presented properly by nurses.\"\n\nShe wipes at her eyes again, but she's smiling now through the tears. \"She's so small in your arms. And so safe there.\" A pause. \"Thank you, Juan. For loving her like this. For being here this month when you could have left immediately for the campaign. It means everything to me—that you chose to stay, to be her father, not just her king.\"\n\nCatalina makes a small cooing sound against your shoulder, her breath warm on your neck.

Given that she's one month post-partum and has been recovering from a difficult birth with infection, I need to be realistic about her capabilities.\n\nFrom the chapter summaries:\n- She had a traumatic breech birth with massive blood loss\n- Moderate infection (39/100 roll)\n- Expected recovery: 4-6 weeks bedridden, months to full strength\n- It's been one month now\n- Earlier in this chapter (33) it was noted she's \"recovering steadily\" and \"healing continues, physicians report good progress\"\n- She's moving without wincing now, though tires easily\n\nSo she should be able to walk, but not for long distances or strenuous activity. Short walks within the palace would be manageable. She'd probably appreciate the offer - it shows he's thinking of her comfort and capabilities.\n\nI should have her respond realistically - she can walk, but acknowledges her limitations. Maybe she'd like a short walk, or perhaps to the chapel? Or just around their chambers? She'd be honest about what she can manage.\n\nIsabel considers for a moment, then stands carefully from her chair. \"I can walk,\" she says, testing her balance. \"Not far, and not quickly, but... yes. The physicians say gentle movement helps with recovery. I've been walking the chambers and corridors a little each day.\"\n\nShe moves toward you, placing a hand on the small of her back briefly—a residual discomfort. \"A month ago I couldn't stand without help. Now I can manage short distances, though I tire more easily than I'd like.\" A small, self-deprecating smile. \"Sixteen and I feel like an old woman.\"\n\nShe reaches out to gently touch Catalina's back as the baby rests on your shoulder. \"Did you want to walk somewhere? The corridors? Perhaps to the chapel?\" She glances toward the door, then back to you. \"Or we could just walk here in our chambers if you prefer. I'm happy either way—I just want to be with you tonight.\"\n\nThere's a slight hesitation, then: \"Though if you're thinking of going far, I should be honest. I can manage the royal chapel in the alcázar, or a slow walk through the nearby halls. But the gardens or anywhere requiring stairs...\" She shakes her head. \"Not yet.

Oh Juan, that would be wonderful.\" She moves closer, her hand finding yours again. \"Even a few extra days together would mean so much. And Mother would love more time with you—she barely got to know you at the wedding before you had to leave for the crusade.\"\n\nAt the mention of visiting Portugal, her eyes brighten further despite her fatigue. \"I grew up mostly in Lisbon,\" she says warmly. \"Father's court is there, in the Paço da Ribeira overlooking the Tagus. It's beautiful, Juan—the river so wide you can see the ocean beyond, ships coming and going from everywhere. Porto is lovely too, and we visited often, but Lisbon was home.\"\n\nShe pauses, imagining it. \"Father would be so honored to meet you properly. At the wedding there was barely time, just formalities and ceremony. But to have you visit Portugal, to show you Lisbon...\" A wistful smile crosses her face. \"The palace, the cathedral, the markets near the docks. I could take you to the places I loved as a girl. And you could meet my brothers properly—Duarte, Pedro, the others.\"\n\nThen reality settles back over her expression. \"Though perhaps not until I'm fully recovered.

          "text": "1. Briefly narrate the evening together - intimate, tender, their last night before separation\n2. Morning departure scene with Isabel - emotional but she's trying to be strong\n3. Assembly in the courtyard - proper military departure with his guard\n4. Keep it concise but meaningful - focus on the key emotional beats\n5. Stop after the departure scene is set, before he actually leaves, to see if he wants to say or do anything else\n\nI should remember:\n- Isabel is still recovering, so she's in their chambers, not able to come down to courtyard\n- This is harder for her because of the recent trauma of childbirth\n- Catalina is one month old\n- Queen Leonor arrives in 4-5 days\n- This is a 8-9 day journey to Seville\n- He's leaving to campaign against rebel nobles\n\nKeep the tone authentic to medieval farewell - tender but restrained in public, more emotional in private.\n\nThe evening passes quietly. You remain in the chambers with Isabel, talking softly by the fire while Catalina sleeps. Isabel tells you more about Lisbon, about her childhood, painting pictures with words of places she hopes to show you someday. You hold her close, feeling the warmth of her against you, trying to memorize this moment—the three of you together, safe and whole.\n\nWhen Catalina wakes for feeding, you watch Isabel nurse her, the tenderness between mother and daughter almost sacred. Isabel catches you watching and smiles, tired but content. \"This is what I'll remember while you're gone,\" she says softly. \"You looking at us like this.\"\n\nThe night grows late. Eventually you both lie down, though neither of you sleeps much. Isabel stays curled against you, her hand finding yours in the darkness, holding tight.\n\nFebruary 28, 1432 - Dawn\n\nThe first light comes too soon. Servants arrive quietly to help you dress in traveling clothes—practical wool and leather, your white armor packed for the journey. Isabel rises carefully, wrapping herself in a robe, and watches as you prepare.\n\nWhen you're ready, she comes to you. For a long moment you just hold each other, no words needed. Then she pulls back, her hands on your chest, looking up at you with red-rimmed eyes but steady resolve.\n\n\"Go with God, Juan,\" she says, her voice only trembling slightly. \"Do what you must do. Bring justice to the realm.\" She swallows hard. \"And then come home to us.\"\n\nYou kiss her—long and deep, tasting salt from her tears. She kisses you back desperately, as if trying to hold onto this moment forever.\n\nCatalina begins to fuss in her cradle. Isabel goes to her, lifting your daughter and bringing her to you. You kiss Catalina's forehead, breathing in that unique baby scent. \"Be good for your mother,\" you whisper.\n\nIsabel clutches Catalina close, one arm around the baby, her other hand reaching for yours one last time. \"I love you,\" she says. \"Come back to me.\"\n\nThen Doña Beatriz gently touches Isabel's shoulder—a reminder that drawing this out only makes it harder. Isabel nods, understanding, and steps back.\n\nThe Courtyard\n\nThe dawn air is cold and crisp. Your mounted guard—fifty knights in Castilian colors—are assembled in formation, horses stamping and snorting, breath misting in the morning air. Álvaro de Luna is there, along with Don Fadrique Enríquez and several other nobles who will ride with you to Seville.\n\nSquires hold your horse—a strong destrier, freshly groomed and ready for the long journey. Your white armor is packed in the supply wagons along with campaign provisions.\n\nThe courtyard torches still burn as dawn breaks over Toledo's walls. Citizens are beginning to gather at the gates, word having spread that the king departs for Seville to deal with the rebel nobles.\n\nÁlvaro approaches and bows. \"Your Majesty. All is ready. We await your command to ride.\"\n\nThe fifty knights sit at attention, morning light glinting off polished mail and lance tips. Behind them, supply wagons loaded with provisions for the eight-day journey. The gates stand open, the road to Seville waiting beyond.\n\nWhat do you do?"

          "text": "**Current Situation (Winter/Spring 1432):**\n- Lost most of eastern Granada (Alcalá la Real, multiple fortresses in the Vega)\n- Lost most of western coastal areas (40+ miles, 6+ fortresses)\n- Lost interior strongholds (Ronda, Gaucín)\n- Main army destroyed at Alcalá la Real\n- Received 2,500 Moroccan reinforcements (November 1431)\n- Controls: Granada city, immediate surroundings, a few remaining fortresses\n- Completely isolated, no relief possible\n- Economy devastated by loss of agricultural lands\n- Population fleeing or already conquered\n\n**Historical Context:**\nLooking at real medieval Granada sieges and the final fall in 1492:\n- Nasrid sultans often had internal power struggles\n- They tried to play Christian kingdoms against each other\n- They sought aid from North Africa (Marinids, later Ottomans)\n- They used diplomacy, bribery, and playing for time\n- Sometimes military resistance, sometimes negotiated surrender\n- Final sultan Boabdil had internal rivals, civil war weakened resistance\n\n**Realistic Options for Yusuf III:**\n\n1. **Negotiate surrender on terms** - Most realistic given hopeless situation\n2. **Fight to the death** - Possible but suicidal\n3. **Request massive North African intervention** - Can request but unlikely to get enough\n\n4. **Internal coup/civil war** - Rivals might overthrow him to negotiate better terms\n5. **Desperate military gambit** - Sally out, try to break sieges, guerrilla warfare\n6. **Play for time** - Diplomatic delays, small raids, hope for Christian disunity\n7. **Seek mediation** - Through neutral parties, try for tributary status\n8. **Fortify Granada city** - Prepare for final siege, make it costly\n\nI see multiple desperate strategies emerging from Yusuf's dire circumstances. With his kingdom crumbling, he'll likely pursue a combination of diplomatic maneuvering and internal power plays. The most pragmatic approach involves seeking mediation, buying time through diplomatic delays, and potentially allowing internal rivals to negotiate more favorable surrender terms. His goal is survival and preserving some autonomy in an increasingly hopeless situation.\n\nThe potential outcomes range from total collapse to unexpected strategic brilliance, reflecting the complex political landscape. Each potential move carries significant risk, with success depending on timing, external political dynamics, and sheer unpredictability of the conflict.\n\nThe Journey to Seville (February 28 - March 7, 1432)\n\nThe journey south passes uneventfully through late winter Castile. Your mounted guard makes good time through familiar territory—Toledo to Ciudad Real to Córdoba to Seville. The roads are muddy but passable, the weather cold but clear. Villages along the route cheer as the king's banner passes, word of the crusade's success and the coming campaign against rebel nobles having spread throughout the realm.\n\nYou arrive in Seville on March 7th, eight days after departing Toledo. The city's gates open wide, and Don Rodrigo Manrique meets you in the main plaza with a full honor guard.\n\nBefore We Assess Current Situation\n\nYou're right—we need to determine what Sultan Yusuf III has been doing during winter and what strategy he's pursuing for the coming campaign season. This is a critical CHAOS ROLL situation (enemy strategic decision, wide variance in outcomes appropriate).\n\nLet me draft the strategic situation and d100 table:\n\nSULTAN YUSUF III'S STRATEGIC SITUATION - WINTER 1431/32\n\nCurrent Reality (Objectively Grim)\n\nTerritory Lost:\n\nEastern Granada: Alcalá la Real, multiple Vega fortresses, agricultural heartland\n\nWestern coast: 40+ miles, six major fortresses, critical ports\n\nInterior: Ronda, Gaucín, raider networks destroyed\n\nRemaining: Granada city, immediate surroundings, handful of isolated fortresses\n\nMilitary Situation:\n\nMain field army destroyed at Alcalá la Real (August 1431)\n\n2,500 Moroccan reinforcements arrived (November 1431)\n\nGarrison forces in remaining fortresses (perhaps 3,000-4,000 total)\n\nGranada city defenders (perhaps 5,000-6,000)\n\nNo capacity for offensive operations\n\nTotal military strength: ~10,000-12,000 (vs. Juan's potential 25,000+)\n\nEconomic Collapse:\n\nLost most agricultural land (Vega, coastal plains)\n\nTrade routes cut off\n\nTreasury depleted from years of warfare\n\nPopulation fleeing to Castilian-held territories or starving\n\nTax base destroyed\n\nDiplomatic Isolation:\n\nNo Christian allies will help\n\nMorocco sent token force but cannot/will not send more (own problems, sea crossing dangerous)\n\nNo hope of relief from outside\n\nHistorical Parallel: This mirrors late-stage Nasrid Granada (1480s-1492), where sultans faced:\n\nInternal power struggles\n\nImpossible military situation\n\nChoices between fighting hopelessly or negotiating surrender\n\nFactional splits between war party and peace party\n\nD100 TABLE: SULTAN'S WINTER/SPRING STRATEGY\n\nRoll for Sultan Yusuf III's Strategic Response\n\n1-15: COMPLETE INTERNAL COLLAPSE\n\nPalace coup: Yusuf III overthrown by rivals during winter\n\nCivil war erupts between factions (war party vs. peace party)\n\nGranada tears itself apart before Juan even arrives\n\nMultiple factions send competing surrender offers\n\nCity defenses undermined, chaos in command structure\n\nBest case for Juan: Granada practically defeats itself, minimal Castilian casualties\n\nComplication: Multiple surrender negotiations, determining legitimate authority\n\n16-30: DEMORALIZED DEFENSIVE POSTURE\n\nYusuf III recognizes hopelessness, pulls all forces into Granada city\n\nAbandons outlying fortresses without fight (garrison commanders surrender readily)\n\nNo winter operations, purely passive defense\n\nAttempts half-hearted diplomatic feelers for terms\n\nBest case for Juan: Fortresses fall without resistance, can focus entirely on Granada\n\nComplication: None significant, just mopping up\n\n31-50: COMPETENT BUT HOPELESS DEFENSE\n\nYusuf consolidates remaining forces intelligently\n\nFortifies Granada city properly (stockpiles, repairs walls, organizes militia)\n\nGarrisons in outlying forts ordered to resist as long as possible to buy time\n\nSends formal embassy to Morocco requesting major intervention (politely refused)\n\nSome raiding from remaining fortresses to harass Castilian garrisons\n\nCreates modest delays: Each fortress requires proper siege (1-3 weeks each)\n\nGranada siege more difficult: Well-prepared defenses, will take months\n\nOutcome still inevitable: Just costs more time and some casualties\n\n51-65: EFFECTIVE DELAYING STRATEGY\n\nYusuf plays for time brilliantly: diplomatic missions, tribute offers, conversion negotiations\n\nSimultaneously strengthens defenses and conducts guerrilla warfare\n\nRemaining fortresses conduct aggressive raids on Castilian supply lines\n\nUses Moroccan troops for mobile harassment force\n\nExploits any weather delays or Castilian logistical problems\n\nAttempts to bribe Castilian nobles, sow discord in crusade\n\nCreates real problems: 2-3 month delay minimum, increased costs\n\nSome tactical successes: Supply trains hit, isolated garrisons harassed\n\nOutcome still inevitable: But makes Juan work for it\n\n66-80: DESPERATE BUT EFFECTIVE MILITARY GAMBIT\n\nYusuf recognizes negotiation hopeless, chooses to inflict maximum cost\n\nConcentrates all forces for surprise offensive against weakest Castilian garrison\n\nWinter/early spring attack while Juan in Toledo catches Christians off-guard\n\nTakes back one fortress temporarily or inflicts serious defeat on isolated force\n\nSignificant setback: 500-1,000 Castilian casualties, loss of fortress, morale blow\n\nDelays campaign: Must reorganize, reinforce, respond to crisis\n\nPolitical complications: Nobles question strategy, some want to withdraw\n\nOutcome still inevitable: But costly, Granada shows it can still bite\n\n81-90: BRILLIANT DEFENSIVE STRATEGY WITH EXTERNAL SUPPORT\n\nYusuf's diplomatic missions bear unexpected fruit\n\nMorocco sends second wave: 3,000-4,000 additional troops (major commitment)\n\nAnd/or: Aragonese factions secretly provide weapons/supplies (undermining crusade)\n\nAnd/or: Some Castilian conversos/Muslims conduct sabotage/espionage\n\nCombined with brilliant defensive tactics, creates serious military challenge\n\nMajor complications: Campaign takes 6+ months, significant casualties\n\nPolitical fallout: Questions about crusade costs, noble grumbling\n\nPossible negotiated settlement: Tributary status rather than conquest?\n\nOutcome uncertain: Might actually force terms rather than total victory\n\n91-95: MASTERSTROKE - INTERNAL CASTILIAN PROBLEMS EXPLOITED\n\nYusuf's agents successfully bribe/convince major Castilian noble(s) to withdraw\n\nAnd/or: Sultan's diplomats convince Pope/Cardinal that negotiated peace better\n\nAnd/or: Arranges assassination attempt on key Castilian commander\n\nCreates crisis in crusade coalition just as military operations begin\n\nSerious crisis: Might require Juan to return to deal with internal revolt\n\nCampaign paralyzed: Cannot proceed while political situation unstable\n\nOutcome genuinely uncertain: Granada survives another year minimum\n\n96-100: THE UNTHINKABLE - GAME-CHANGING DEVELOPMENT\n\nMultiple factors combine in Granada's favor:\n\nMajor Moroccan commitment (5,000+ troops) AND\n\nAragonese intervention (either direct or massive covert support) AND\n\nCastilian internal crisis (noble revolt, or worse) AND/OR\n\nJuan's personal crisis (illness, injury, family tragedy) AND/OR\n\nExternal shock (Ottoman pressure on Christian kingdoms, papal crisis)\n\nCrusade collapses or delayed years: Granada survives\n\nAlternative outcome possible: Granada as tributary rather than conquered\n\nHistorical divergence: Emirate survives into later 15th century\n\nThis table reflects genuine chaos and unpredictability. The Sultan is a desperate man facing inevitable defeat, but desperate men can be dangerous. Medieval warfare had many examples of seemingly hopeless situations where the defender inflicted terrible costs or even won through unexpected developments.\n\nWhen you're ready, roll d100 for Sultan's strategy.\n\nAfter we see that result, I'll provide the full situation report from Seville including what Don Rodrigo has observed from Granada during the winter."

He'll meet with Don Rodrigo Manrique and other commanders and get a situation report covering:\n\n1. What the Sultan has been doing during winter (the roll result)\n2. Status of remaining Granada fortresses\n3. Status of Castilian garrisons in conquered territories\n4. Intelligence from spies/deserters\n5. Condition of assembled forces in Seville\n6. Status of the rebel nobles (Baron de Medina, Count of Niebla)\n\nLet me create a comprehensive situation report that naturally incorporates the d100 roll result while providing all the information Juan needs to understand the current strategic picture.\n\nSITUATION REPORT - SEVILLE, MARCH 7, 1432\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique's Briefing\n\nDon Rodrigo meets you in the Alcázar of Seville, where maps of Granada and western Andalusia are spread across a large table. Several other commanders are present: Don García Fernández Manrique (Don Rodrigo's cousin), Captain Alonso de Cárdenas (representing the Military Orders), and Juan de Silva (your intelligence coordinator).\n\nDon Rodrigo bows deeply. \"Your Majesty, welcome to Seville. The army assembles well—currently 6,800 troops with more arriving daily. We should reach 7,500 by week's end. The five bombards arrived from Jaén three days ago and are being prepared.\" He gestures to the map. \"But the most interesting news comes from Granada itself.\"\n\nINTELLIGENCE FROM GRANADA (Winter 1431-1432)\n\nJuan de Silva steps forward, a former merchant who now runs your intelligence network. \"Your Majesty, we have had excellent penetration into Granada through merchants, deserters, and paid informants. The picture is clear: Sultan Yusuf III has abandoned all pretense of offensive operations.\"\n\nKey Observations:\n\n1. Mass Withdrawal to Granada City (December-January)\n\nYusuf ordered all remaining field forces to concentrate in Granada city\n\nThe 2,500 Moroccan reinforcements (arrived November) marched directly to the capital\n\nGarrison commanders in outlying fortresses received orders: \"Hold as long as reasonable, then seek terms\"\n\nNo attempts to contest Castilian control of conquered territories\n\nNo winter raiding, no harassment of supply lines—complete passivity\n\n2. Fortress Garrisons Demoralized\n\"We've had contact with several fortress commanders,\" Juan de Silva continues. \"They know their situation is hopeless. Orders from the Sultan essentially give them permission to surrender when pressed. Exact wording was reportedly: 'Resist with honor, but preserve your men's lives when resistance becomes futile.'\"\n\nRemaining Granada Fortresses:\n\nLoja (40 miles west of Granada city): ~400 garrison, well-supplied, strong position\n\nÍllora (20 miles northwest of Granada): ~250 garrison, commands approach road\n\nMoclín (25 miles north): ~300 garrison, mountain fortress\n\nAlhama de Granada (30 miles southwest): ~200 garrison, isolated position\n\nSalobreña (coastal, 30 miles south): ~150 garrison, small port\n\nPlus handful of minor towers and outposts (~300 total)\n\n\"None are preparing for serious resistance,\" de Silva reports. \"They're maintaining discipline, but when your bombards arrive they'll likely negotiate quickly. They know relief isn't coming.\"\n\n3. Diplomatic Feelers\n\"The Sultan sent an embassy to Seville in January,\" Don Rodrigo adds. \"They came under flag of truce requesting audience. I received them politely but told them only Your Majesty could discuss terms. They returned to Granada.\"\n\nThe embassy's message was essentially: What terms would the King of Castile consider for a negotiated surrender of Granada city? Could the Sultan retain some authority? Could the Alhambra be spared? Could the people be guaranteed safety?\n\n\"Probing questions,\" Don Rodrigo observes. \"Testing whether negotiated surrender is possible or if total conquest is inevitable. They seemed... resigned. Not defiant.\"\n\n4. Internal Situation in Granada City\nMultiple deserters and refugees have fled to Castilian lines over winter. Their reports are consistent:\n\nFood supplies adequate but not abundant (grain stored, but limited)\n\nPopulation declining through flight and starvation (perhaps 40,000 remain, down from 50,000+)\n\nMilitary garrison strong on paper (~5,000 soldiers plus 2,500 Moroccans) but morale poor\n\nFactional tensions between war party (mostly Moroccan-backed zealots) and peace party (pragmatic nobles who want to survive)\n\nSultan politically weak - respected but not feared, cannot enforce unity\n\nDefenses good - walls maintained, artillery positions prepared, stockpiles adequate for 6-month siege\n\nNo hope - everyone knows the end is coming, just question of when and how\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Juan de Silva concludes, \"Granada is a fruit waiting to fall. The Sultan has accepted defeat—he's just trying to manage the manner of his surrender to preserve what he can.\"\n\nSTATUS OF CASTILIAN GARRISONS\n\nDon García Fernández Manrique provides this report:\n\n\"All conquered territories remain secure, Your Majesty. No significant incidents over winter.\"\n\nEastern Garrisons (Vega Region):\n\nAlcalá la Real: 800 troops, well-supplied, some farming beginning\n\nVega fortresses (4 locations): 400 troops total, controlling agricultural lands\n\nStatus: Peaceful. Local Muslim population complying with occupation. Some conversions. Tax collection beginning.\n\nWestern Garrisons (Coastal):\n\nRonda: 600 troops under Don Rodrigo de Perea (appointed governor), prospering\n\nMarbella: 400 troops, port functioning, trade resuming\n\nCoastal fortresses (4 locations): 500 troops total\n\nStatus: Very stable. Trade with Christian merchants increasing. Muslim population accepting situation.\n\nInterior Garrisons:\n\nGaucín and minor fortresses: 300 troops total\n\nStatus: Quiet. Mountain fortresses controlling interior routes.\n\n\"The land grants are working brilliantly,\" Don García notes. \"Nobles with estates in western Granada maintain garrisons at own expense. They have incentive to keep territory secure and productive. Your innovation is proving very cost-effective, Your Majesty.\"\n\nNo Rebel Activity from Granada\n\"Not a single raid all winter,\" Don Rodrigo emphasizes. \"Not one supply caravan attacked. Not one outpost probed. Complete passivity. The Sultan has conceded control of everything outside Granada city.\"\n\nASSEMBLED FORCES IN SEVILLE\n\nCaptain Alonso de Cárdenas provides the military readiness report:\n\nCurrent Forces (March 7th):\n\n6,800 troops assembled and in camp outside Seville\n\nExpected by March 15th: 7,500-8,000 troops\n\nComposition: \n3,500 feudal cavalry (nobles' retinues)\n\n2,200 infantry (city militias, professional companies)\n\n550-600 foreign mercenaries (Hungarians, Italians, French, Germans - from Military Academy)\n\n800 Military Order knights and sergeants\n\n200 artillery crew and engineers\n\nArtillery:\n\nFive bombards from Jaén (arrived March 4th, being prepared)\n\nAdequate powder and shot for extended campaign\n\nSiege equipment being constructed (ladders, rams if needed)\n\nSupply Status:\n\nProvisions for two months already stockpiled\n\nSupply trains organized from Córdoba and Seville\n\nAdequate funds from crusade taxation (treasury healthy)\n\n\"We can march within a week of your order, Your Majesty,\" Captain Alonso states confidently.\n\nREBEL NOBLES STATUS\n\nDon Rodrigo turns to the western map. \"Now for the complications, Your Majesty. The three rebel nobles.\"\n\n1. Don García de Sotomayor (Minor Issue - RESOLVED)\n\"His son inherited and submitted immediately, as we expected. The estate is peaceful and the young Don García has sworn fealty. No action required beyond accepting his oath formally.\"\n\n2. Baron de Medina (Sanlúcar de Barrameda - Major Issue)\n\"Baron Alfonso de Guzmán remains barricaded in his fortress at Sanlúcar. He's reinforced the walls, hired mercenaries (perhaps 150 men), and refuses all communication. The town around the fortress is loyal to him—he's a local magnate with deep roots. We cannot simply extract him without a siege.\"\n\nMilitary Assessment:\n\nStrong coastal fortress\n\n150-200 defenders\n\nTown population supportive of baron (complicates assault)\n\nRequires siege with bombards\n\nEstimated 2-3 weeks to reduce\n\n3. Count of Niebla (Southwestern Huelva - Major Issue)\n\"Count Diego de Guzmán has fortified his castle at Niebla and assembled approximately 200 troops—mix of his household knights and hired soldiers. He's proclaimed he'll resist 'tyrannical taxation' to the death. His territory is remote, near Portuguese border.\"\n\nMilitary Assessment:\n\nWell-fortified castle\n\n200-250 defenders\n\nRemote location (difficult logistics)\n\nWill require siege\n\nEstimated 3-4 weeks to reduce\n\n\"Both will require military force, Your Majesty,\" Don Rodrigo concludes. \"They've refused the Crown Marshal summons, ignored the excommunications, and are actively fortifying. We have legal and moral authority—now we need to apply military force.\"\n\nSTRATEGIC ASSESSMENT\n\nDon Rodrigo looks at you directly. \"Your Majesty, we face a choice of priorities:\"\n\nOption A: Deal with Rebels First\n\nMarch west to Sanlúcar (4 days)\n\nSiege and reduce Baron de Medina (2-3 weeks)\n\nMarch to Niebla (2 days)\n\nSiege and reduce Count of Niebla (3-4 weeks)\n\nThen turn to Granada fortresses (April/May)\n\nAdvantages: Establishes crown authority, removes internal threats, secures western flank\n\nDisadvantages: Gives Granada more time to prepare\n\nOption B: Granada First, Rebels Second\n\nMarch directly to Granada fortresses (Loja most logical first target)\n\nReduce them sequentially (1-2 weeks each with demoralized garrisons)\n\nBesiege Granada city itself\n\nDeal with rebels afterward if they still resist\n\nAdvantages: Exploits Sultan's passivity, maintains crusade momentum\n\nDisadvantages: Leaves rebel nobles at your back\n\nOption C: Simultaneous Operations\n\nSplit forces: You take main army (with bombards) to Sanlúcar and Niebla\n\nSend secondary force under another commander to accept fortress surrenders in Granada\n\nConverge on Granada city later\n\nAdvantages: Addresses both problems simultaneously\n\nDisadvantages: Divided forces, complex coordination\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" Don Rodrigo concludes, \"the strategic situation with Granada could not be better. The Sultan is broken. But these rebel nobles are Castilian problem that must be resolved. What are your orders?\"\n\nThe map shows clearly:\n\nSanlúcar de Barrameda: 4 days west of Seville\n\nNiebla: 2 days northwest of Sanlúcar\n\nLoja (nearest Granada fortress): 6 days east of Seville\n\nGranada city: 8-9 days east of Seville\n\nYour 6,800 troops (soon 7,500-8,000) await your command. The five bombards are ready. The campaign season opens before you.\n\nWhat do you decide?"

          "text": "1. **Rebels first** - Makes sense to secure internal stability before final Granada push\n2. **Simultaneous sieges** - Split forces to save time\n3. **Juan goes to Sanlúcar with bombards** - Taking personal command of harder target\n4. **Master of Calatrava to Niebla** - Secondary commander handles other siege\n5. **Estate distribution planned** - Rewarding loyal nobles with Granada lands\n6. **Church involvement** - Converting mosques, establishing religious presence\n\nThis is good strategic thinking. Let me work through the military logistics:\n\n**Force Division:**\n- Total: ~7,000 troops currently (will grow to 7,500-8,000)\n- Sanlúcar needs bombards and majority of force (it's the main target)\n- Niebla needs sufficient force for siege but doesn't need heavy artillery\n\nReasonable split:\n- **Sanlúcar (with Juan):** 4,500-5,000 troops + 5 bombards + Infante Juan\n- **Niebla (Master of Calatrava):** 2,500-3,000 troops, no bombards (can use other siege methods)\n\n**Timeline estimate:**\n- March to positions: 2-4 days\n- Sieges: 2-3 weeks each (possibly faster with demoralized defenders)\n- Then consolidate and march to Granada\n\n**Estate distribution:** This is smart - installing nobles in conquered Granada territories as he takes them, shifting garrison costs to the nobility who benefit.\n\n**Church involvement:** Converting mosques is historically accurate and fits the crusade ideology.\n\nI need to:\n1. Have Don Rodrigo and others respond to the plan\n2. Confirm force distributions\n3. Set the sieges in motion\n4. Handle any immediate complications or questions\n\nLet me narrate the council's response and implementation of Juan's orders.\n\nDon Rodrigo's face lights up at your decisiveness. \"Immediate action. Excellent, Your Majesty. We strike both targets simultaneously and finish this quickly.\"\n\nHe turns to the map, calculating quickly. \"If we march tomorrow—March 8th—we can have bombards at Sanlúcar by March 12th and begin bombardment immediately. Master of Calatrava can reach Niebla by March 10th and establish siege lines.\"\n\nFORCE ALLOCATION\n\nCaptain Alonso de Cárdenas steps forward. \"Your Majesty, I recommend the following division:\"\n\nSanlúcar de Barrameda Force (Under King Juan II):\n\n5,000 troops (majority of army)\n\nAll five bombards with crews\n\nInfante Juan commanding cavalry wing\n\nHeavy siege train\n\nReason: Baron de Medina's fortress is stronger, has more defenders, requires overwhelming force and artillery\n\nNiebla Force (Under Master of Calatrava):\n\n2,500-3,000 troops\n\nNo bombards (will use rams, ladders, starvation if needed)\n\nMilitary Order contingent\n\nLighter siege equipment\n\nReason: Count of Niebla's castle is more remote but smaller; Master can handle with infantry-heavy force\n\n\"When Sanlúcar falls—likely within 2-3 weeks—Your Majesty can march to reinforce Niebla if the Master needs assistance. Or, if Niebla falls quickly, forces can rendezvous for Granada campaign.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo nods approval. \"Sound allocation. Your Majesty will have the hammer for the harder nut, while Master of Calatrava applies steady pressure to the weaker target.\"\n\nINFANTE JUAN'S RESPONSE\n\nThe Infante—your half-brother, now fully rehabilitated and trusted—steps forward and kneels. \"Your Majesty honors me with this command. I will serve faithfully at Sanlúcar. Baron de Medina will see that defying the crown has consequences.\"\n\nThere's genuine gratitude in his voice. After years in the wilderness, being given military command alongside the king himself represents complete restoration of trust.\n\nMASTER OF CALATRAVA'S RESPONSE\n\nDon Luis González de Guzmán, Master of the Military Order of Calatrava, bows deeply. \"Your Majesty, the Order accepts this holy duty. Count of Niebla—my own distant kinsman, regrettably—has chosen rebellion over faith and law. We will reduce his fortress and bring him to justice.\"\n\nHis voice hardens. \"The Military Orders exist precisely for such work—enforcing God's law against those who defy it. Niebla will fall.\"\n\nESTATE DISTRIBUTION PLAN\n\nDon Rodrigo pulls out a scroll—clearly he and Álvaro have been working on this. \"Your Majesty, we have the list of nobles to receive estates in conquered Granada. You mentioned summoning them to Seville?\"\n\nNoble Recipients (Primary Grants):\n\nDon Rodrigo de Perea - Ronda and surrounding territory (already installed, doing excellently)\n\nMendoza family branches - Coastal estates near Marbella (3-4 different grants)\n\nMaster of Santiago's Order - Holdings near Gibraltar and coastal fortresses\n\nDon Fadrique Enríquez - Territory near Loja (when conquered)\n\nInfante Juan - Grant in eastern Vega region (reward for loyalty)\n\nVarious lesser nobles - Smaller estates throughout conquered territory\n\nAdditional Recipients (Pending):\n\nConverso families elevated to nobility (controversial but planned)\n\nForeign crusade veterans who distinguished themselves\n\nYounger sons of great houses seeking their fortunes\n\n\"When would Your Majesty like to formally invest these lords?\" Don Rodrigo asks. \"Before the sieges begin? Or after the rebels are dealt with?\"\n\nCHURCH INVOLVEMENT\n\nCardinal Capranica—who has been standing quietly at the back of the council—steps forward. \"Your Majesty summons the Church to the work of conversion? We answer eagerly.\"\n\nHis eyes gleam with genuine enthusiasm. \"I will send word immediately to every monastery and cathedral in Andalusia. Franciscans, Dominicans, regular clergy—they will come to establish churches in the conquered lands, convert the mosques, and begin the holy work of bringing souls to Christ.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds carefully: \"The conversion of mosques to churches must be done properly—with formal ceremonies, cleansing rites, reconsecration. Not merely putting crosses on Muslim buildings, but true transformation. This will take priests, resources, and time. But Your Majesty is correct to begin now, while military operations continue. When Granada city falls, we must be ready to convert the Great Mosque immediately.\"\n\n\"How many priests can you summon?\" you ask.\n\n\"Within two weeks? Perhaps fifty to begin—more will come as word spreads. The Franciscans especially are eager for this work. They see it as their divine mission to evangelize the newly conquered territories.\"\n\nIMMEDIATE ORDERS ISSUED\n\nDon Rodrigo begins giving rapid orders to assembled captains:\n\nTomorrow Morning (March 8th):\n\nKing's force (5,000 troops) marches west toward Sanlúcar\n\nFive bombards and siege train begin movement (slower, will arrive March 12th)\n\nMaster of Calatrava's force (2,500 troops) marches northwest toward Niebla\n\nHerald sent to both rebel nobles:\n\nFinal warning: Submit within 24 hours or face siege\n\nFormal declaration: Crown Marshal authority, papal excommunication, military enforcement\n\nLegal formality before assault begins\n\nSupply trains organized:\n\nFood, powder, shot for both sieges\n\nMedical supplies and field hospitals\n\nContinuous resupply from Seville\n\nIntelligence network activated:\n\nScouts to both fortresses to assess defenses\n\nAgents to contact townspeople, gauge support for barons\n\nWatch for any unexpected reinforcements or complications\n\nFINAL QUESTION\n\nDon Rodrigo looks at you directly. \"Your Majesty, one final matter before we march. The estate investitures—shall we hold the formal ceremony now, before departing Seville? It would take perhaps two hours this afternoon. Or wait until after the sieges conclude?\"\n\nArguments for doing it now:\n\nShows confidence in victory\n\nGives newly-invested nobles time to prepare to occupy their estates\n\nPublic ceremony in Seville demonstrates royal authority\n\nArguments for waiting:\n\nMaintains focus on immediate military task\n\nAllows you to include grants from newly-conquered fortresses (Loja, etc.)\n\nVictory celebration more appropriate after rebels crushed\n\nWhat do you decide about the estate investiture ceremony? And is there anything else you want to address before the armies march tomorrow morning?"

          "text": "This is very much in character for Juan - he's shown repeatedly that he prefers personal diplomacy and giving people chances to surrender with dignity (Ronda being the prime example). He trusts in God to protect him and believes in showing himself to enemies.\n\nDon Rodrigo and others will probably be concerned about the personal risk, but Juan has established this pattern. They'll accept it but worry.\n\nThe clarification about church/holy orders not getting land grants is important - everything to lay nobles creates a different power structure.\n\nI should:\n1. Show reactions to the no-warning decision and personal appeal plan\n2. Clarify the land grant policy (church gets mosques/religious buildings only, no territory)\n3. Narrate the ride ahead to Sanlúcar with vanguard\n4. Keep it relatively brief since this is movement/setup, not the main event yet\n5. Stop when Juan arrives at Sanlúcar and can see the situation firsthand\n\nDon Rodrigo's eyes widen slightly. \"Your Majesty intends to personally parley with the rebels? As you did at Ronda?\" There's concern in his voice, but also understanding—he's seen this pattern before.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna speaks up, his tone careful. \"Your Majesty, Baron de Medina and Count of Niebla are not Muslim commanders accepting inevitable defeat. They are Castilian nobles in active rebellion against your authority. They may not honor parley—\"\n\n\"Then they will answer to God,\" you interrupt quietly. \"But I must try. If I can bring them back to obedience without bloodshed, without destroying Castilian fortresses and killing Castilian soldiers, then I am obligated to try.\"\n\nA long pause. Then Don Rodrigo bows his head. \"As Your Majesty commands. We establish siege positions first, demonstrate our overwhelming force, then you offer personal parley. If they refuse or act treacherously...\" He doesn't finish, but his hand rests on his sword hilt.\n\nLAND GRANT CLARIFICATION\n\nCardinal Capranica looks puzzled. \"Your Majesty, when you said to invite the Church, I understood you meant—\"\n\n\"I meant the spiritual work, Your Eminence,\" you clarify. \"Converting mosques to churches, bringing priests to minister to the faithful, evangelizing the Muslim population. That is the Church's sacred duty and I want it done properly.\"\n\nYou gesture to the map. \"But the territory itself—the estates, the lands, the fortresses—these go to the new nobility. Lay lords who will govern, defend, and develop these lands. The Church will have the mosques as parish churches, monasteries where appropriate, tithes from the faithful. But not landed estates or temporal power.\"\n\nCapranica absorbs this, his expression neutral. \"I... see. A different model than in other reconquered territories, where the Military Orders received significant grants.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo actually looks pleased. \"Your Majesty is creating a new aristocracy, not empowering existing institutions. Brilliant. These new nobles will owe everything to the crown—more loyal than ancient houses or established orders.\"\n\nYou nod. \"Exactly. The crusade creates opportunity for service and reward. Those who serve well receive lands. Those who sit out or rebel...\" You don't need to finish.\n\nDEPARTURE - MARCH 8, 1432\n\nThe armies begin moving at dawn. Master of Calatrava's 2,500 troops march northwest toward Niebla, their banners streaming in the morning wind. Your larger force—5,000 strong—prepares to march west to Sanlúcar.\n\nBut you don't wait for the main body.\n\n\"Infante Juan,\" you call. \"Assemble two hundred of our fastest cavalry. We ride ahead.\"\n\nThe Infante immediately begins selecting men—light cavalry, well-mounted, experienced riders. Within an hour, the vanguard is ready: two hundred horsemen, your white banner at the head, moving fast.\n\nDon Rodrigo rides up, concerned. \"Your Majesty, the main army with the bombards won't reach Sanlúcar for four days. You'll arrive with just two hundred men—\"\n\n\"And Baron de Medina will see that I came personally, with a small force, offering him the chance to submit before the siege engines arrive,\" you reply. \"If he has any wisdom at all, he'll recognize the gesture.\"\n\nÁlvaro, riding beside you, adds quietly: \"And if he doesn't, the vanguard can establish reconnaissance and prepare positions until the main force arrives. It's actually sound tactics, Don Rodrigo.\"\n\nThe older knight shakes his head but doesn't argue further. \"God protect you, Your Majesty.\"\n\nTHE RIDE TO SANLÚCAR (March 8-9, 1432)\n\nYour vanguard makes excellent time. Two hundred light cavalry can move much faster than a full army with siege train. You follow the coastal road west from Seville, through rolling hills and early spring countryside.\n\nDay 1 (March 8):\n\nDepart Seville at mid-morning\n\nCover 45 miles through familiar Castilian territory\n\nCamp at Lebrija that evening\n\nLocal nobles provide hospitality, shocked to see the king traveling so lightly\n\n\"We're going to speak with Baron de Medina,\" you tell them simply\n\nDay 2 (March 9):\n\nDepart at dawn\n\nFinal 25 miles to Sanlúcar de Barrameda\n\nCoastal terrain, can smell the Atlantic\n\nScouts report ahead: Baron's fortress is fortified, guards on walls, but town itself seems quiet\n\nARRIVAL AT SANLÚCAR - MARCH 9, 1432 (Afternoon)\n\nYou crest a low hill and see Sanlúcar de Barrameda spread before you.\n\nThe Town:\nA prosperous port settlement of perhaps 3,000 inhabitants, situated where the Guadalquivir River meets the Atlantic Ocean. White-washed buildings climb up from the harbor. Fishing boats crowd the waterfront. The smell of salt and fish carries on the wind.\n\nThe Fortress:\nBaron de Medina's castle dominates the high ground overlooking both town and harbor—a strong coastal fortress with thick walls, four corner towers, and commanding position. You can see guards on the walls, banners flying (the Guzmán arms), and signs of recent fortification work. The gates are closed and barred.\n\nThe Situation:\nAs your vanguard rides into view, bells begin ringing in the town. People emerge from buildings, pointing at your white banner. Word spreads quickly: The king is here. King Juan himself, with just two hundred men.\n\nThe fortress walls fill with defenders—you estimate perhaps 150-200 men as Don Rodrigo reported. They watch your approach warily. No arrows are fired, but the gates remain firmly shut.\n\nThe townspeople are more complicated. Some cheer—they recognize royal authority. Others look uncertain—Baron de Medina is their lord, has been for generations. A few retreat into their homes, not wanting to be seen supporting either side.\n\nInfante Juan rides up beside you. \"Your Majesty, the fortress is well-positioned. Without the bombards, we cannot assault it effectively. And they see we're just a vanguard.\"\n\nHe's right. Baron de Medina's fortress would be very difficult to take with just two hundred cavalry. But you didn't come to take it by force today.\n\nFrom the fortress walls, a voice calls out—amplified by speaking through cupped hands: \"Who approaches Sanlúcar?\"\n\nThe town square below the fortress is perhaps three hundred yards from the main gate—open ground, within speaking distance if one shouted, within crossbow range if they chose violence.\n\nYour two hundred cavalry sit mounted behind you, disciplined and ready. The Infante waits for your orders. The townspeople watch from windows and doorways.\n\nWhat do you do?"

Appeal to shared purpose (Reconquista)\n2. Threat (army and cannons coming)\n3. Light humor about the marshals\n4. Direct question about the taxation\n\nThis is a PERSUASION ROLL situation. I need to:\n1. Identify Success Factors (reasons the Baron might submit)\n2. Identify Failure Factors (reasons the Baron might resist)\n3. Create a d100 table where BOTH factors persist across the spectrum\n4. The roll determines HOW the factors manifest - not WHETHER they exist\n\nSuccess Factors for Baron's Submission:\n- King came personally - huge gesture, shows respect\n- Juan's reasonable tone, not threatening\n- Army with bombards IS coming - resistance is futile\n- Legal authority: Crown Marshals, papal excommunication\n- Crusade is legitimate and popular\n- Baron isolated - no allies will help him\n- Town might turn against him if he causes destruction\n- Personal appeal to shared Castilian identity\n- Baron not a zealot - just a tax resister\n- Historical precedent: nobles who submit get mercy, resisters get destroyed\n\nFailure Factors for Baron's Resistance:\n- Pride - he's a great lord, submitted to marshals would be humiliation\n- Financial - the 8% tax IS heavy, he's not wrong about burden\n- Principle - he genuinely believes taxation unjust\n- Family honor - Guzmán family ancient and proud\n- Local power - he's strong here, well-fortified\n- Distrust - what guarantee Juan won't punish him anyway?\n- Precedent - if he submits, establishes crown can override noble privileges\n- Already excommunicated and defiant - hard to back down now\n\n- Fear of looking weak to other nobles\n\nI recognize the critical social dynamics at play. Nobility operates on perception, and appearing vulnerable could undermine the Baron's entire social standing. Showing submission might signal to other nobles that he can be easily pressured, potentially eroding his regional influence and respect. This fear of perceived weakness becomes a powerful psychological barrier to negotiation.\n\nPERSUASION ROLL: BARON DE MEDINA'S RESPONSE\n\nSuccess Factors (Persist at All Roll Levels)\n\nKing came personally—extraordinary gesture showing respect\n\nJuan's reasonable tone, appeals to shared purpose\n\nArmy with five bombards approaching—military reality\n\nLegal authority: Crown Marshals, papal excommunication\n\nCrusade is legitimate, popular, successful\n\nBaron politically isolated—no allies\n\nTown loyalty uncertain if siege causes destruction\n\nAppeal to Castilian unity resonates\n\nBaron not ideological zealot—pragmatic tax resister\n\nSubmission now = mercy; resistance = destruction\n\nFailure Factors (Persist at All Roll Levels)\n\nPride—ancient Guzmán lineage, great lord status\n\nFinancial burden—8% tax IS heavy after campaign costs\n\nPrinciple—believes taxation violates noble privileges\n\nAlready defiant—difficult to back down publicly\n\nFortress strong—can resist for weeks\n\nDistrust—what guarantee of fair treatment?\n\nPrecedent—submission establishes crown can override privileges\n\nHumiliation—submitted to \"dressed up marshals\"\n\nLocal power base—150 loyal troops, supportive town\n\nFamily honor at stake\n\nD100 TABLE: BARON'S REACTION TO JUAN'S PERSONAL APPEAL\n\n1-15: HOSTILE DEFIANCE - Failure Factors Dominate\n\nThe Baron's face hardens. Your personal appearance and reasonable words ARE noted—he's clearly surprised you came yourself—but his pride and anger override everything.\n\n\"The Guzmáns have held Sanlúcar for six generations, Your Majesty. We fought Moors when your grandfather's grandfather was in swaddling clothes. And now you send bureaucrats—marshals—to dictate terms to me like I'm some merchant haggling over wool prices?\"\n\nHis voice rises. \"Eight percent! On top of feudal obligations, on top of existing taxes, on top of the blood and treasure my house has already spent on YOUR crusade! The tax IS unjust—you know it, I know it, every noble in Castile knows it!\"\n\nHe takes a step forward, defiant. \"I've built my life, my honor, my family's legacy on this land. I will NOT surrender it because some Papal Bull and some dressed-up bureaucrats say I must. If you want Sanlúcar, Your Majesty, you'll take it with those cannons you're bringing. But you'll take it over my dead body.\"\n\nThe success factors—your personal presence, the military reality, the legal authority—are all acknowledged implicitly. But they don't move him. He's chosen his hill to die on.\n\nNegotiation impossible. He retreats to fortress. Siege inevitable.\n\n16-35: DEFENSIVE RESISTANCE - Failure Factors Lead\n\nThe Baron's jaw tightens. He doesn't retreat, but his body language is defensive, arms crossed.\n\n\"Your Majesty honors me with this personal visit—truly. And I understand the crusade needs funding. I'm not blind to that.\" He pauses. \"But eight percent? After what we've already contributed? My estates have sent men, horses, supplies. I've paid the regular taxes, the feudal dues, everything required of my station.\"\n\nHis voice hardens. \"And then your marshals arrive—oh, they had fancy titles, I'll grant you—demanding MORE. Not requesting. Demanding. As if I'm some peasant to be ordered about rather than a lord who has served Castile faithfully for decades.\"\n\nHe gestures to his fortress. \"I have 150 good men in there. Walls that can withstand weeks of bombardment. A town that supports me. Yes, you have an army coming. Yes, you have legal authority. But principle matters, Your Majesty. Noble privileges exist for a reason. If kings can simply override them whenever convenient, what separates us from tyranny?\"\n\nHe's not threatening, exactly. But he's not submitting either. The military reality and your personal gesture have made him more respectful, but the financial burden and wounded pride keep him resistant.\n\n\"If you want to discuss reasonable terms—perhaps a reduced rate, perhaps phased payments—I might listen. But unconditional surrender to the full 8%? No.\"\n\nNegotiation possible but difficult. He wants concessions. Will resist without them.\n\n36-55: CONFLICTED - Both Factors in Balance\n\nThe Baron's expression shifts through several emotions as you speak. When you finish, he's silent for a long moment.\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" He stops, starts again. \"When I heard you were coming personally, I thought—well, I didn't know what to think.\" He gestures helplessly. \"Kings don't ride to minor barons' fortresses to discuss taxation. They send armies. They send executioners.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"But you're here. Alone—well, two hundred men, but still. You dismounted. You're talking to me like I'm... like my concerns matter.\"\n\nA pause. \"And you're right about the Reconquista. God knows you're right. We SHOULD be fighting side by side. I'm not some traitor who wants the Moors to win. I've spent my life defending this coast, keeping Castile safe.\"\n\nBut then his face hardens again. \"But that tax, Your Majesty—it's crushing. My estates are productive, yes, but eight percent on top of everything else? My stewards tell me we'll have to sell lands, dismiss retainers. And your marshals—I know they had authority, but the way they presented it... like I was being punished rather than asked to contribute.\"\n\nHe looks torn between pride and pragmatism. \"If you guarantee—truly guarantee—that this isn't about humiliating me. That I can pay the tax and maintain my honor and my position here. That my submission won't be used as precedent to strip all noble privileges...\" He trails off. \"Maybe we can find terms.\"\n\nThe fortress gates remain open behind him—neither committing to fight nor to submit.\n\nGenuine negotiation possible. He's genuinely torn. Needs reassurance and perhaps minor concessions to save face.\n\n56-75: RECEPTIVE BUT CONCERNED - Success Factors Gaining\n\nThe Baron's shoulders slump slightly. Your words have clearly hit home.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I...\" He shakes his head. \"When you put it that way—asking why we're not fighting side by side—it shames me. Truly.\" He looks at the ground, then back up. \"You're right. The crusade is just, necessary. And I HAVE been defying legal authority. The marshals had every right to summon me, and I refused them.\"\n\nHe gestures to his fortress. \"Pride, Your Majesty. Damned pride. The Guzmáns have held Sanlúcar so long, and when officials arrived demanding payment... I bristled. Saw it as attack on my dignity rather than legitimate taxation.\"\n\nA long pause. \"And the financial burden IS real—I wasn't inventing that. Eight percent is heavy. But...\" He looks at your small escort, at you standing there personally. \"You came here yourself. Not with an army to destroy me, but to talk. To appeal to my better nature. To remind me we're Castilians, not enemies.\"\n\nHe's clearly struggling with his decision. \"If I submit now—pay the tax, swear renewed fealty—will I be punished? Humiliated? Made an example of? Or can I... can there be mercy for a foolish old baron who let pride override judgment?\"\n\nThe success factors have resonated strongly. But the failure factors—fear of humiliation, concern about precedent, wounded pride—still need addressing.\n\nStrongly inclined to submit. Needs reassurance about treatment and honor. One more push could seal it.\n\n76-90: WILLING SUBMISSION - Success Factors Dominate\n\nThe Baron's face works through emotions, and then he makes a decision. He takes several steps forward—out from the protection of his fortress walls—and stops just a few paces from you.\n\n\"Your Majesty, when you rode up with just two hundred men and asked to speak with me personally, I thought...\" He laughs bitterly. \"I thought many things. But not that you'd come in good faith to hear my grievances.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"You're right about everything. The crusade is just. The taxation is legitimate. The marshals had authority. And I've been a stubborn, prideful fool who let ancient family honor blind him to present duty.\"\n\nHis voice grows stronger. \"The financial burden is real—I wasn't lying about that. But you know what? So is the burden on every other noble who's paying. And they've managed. I'm not special. I'm not exempt just because my family's old and my fortress is strong.\"\n\nHe drops to one knee right there in the square. \"I submit to Your Majesty's authority. I will pay the crusade tax—the full eight percent—as is my duty. I will swear renewed fealty. I will acknowledge the Crown Marshals' jurisdiction.\"\n\nA pause, then more quietly: \"I only ask—not demand, ask—that you grant me mercy for my foolishness. Allow me to submit with some dignity rather than being dragged from my fortress in chains. Let me serve Castile properly going forward.\"\n\nThe fortress gates remain open. His men on the walls look uncertain—waiting to see if their lord has surrendered or if this is a trick.\n\nComplete submission. Willing to pay, swear fealty, accept authority. Asks only for merciful treatment rather than humiliation.\n\n91-100: ENTHUSIASTIC CAPITULATION - Success Factors Triumph Completely\n\nBefore you even finish speaking, the Baron is shaking his head, and when you mention the cannons coming, he actually laughs—a sound of released tension.\n\n\"Your Majesty, stop. Please.\" He holds up his hands. \"You've made your point superbly. You came personally—the King of Castile himself—to speak with me before destroying my home. You appealed to shared purpose, to Castilian unity, to the Reconquista we all believe in.\"\n\nHe steps forward quickly, dropping to both knees in the square. \"I was wrong. Completely, utterly wrong. Not about the tax being heavy—it IS heavy. But wrong to resist it. Wrong to defy the marshals. Wrong to put my pride and my purse above the needs of the realm and the holy war against Granada.\"\n\nHe looks up at you with genuine emotion. \"When you asked how it came to this—that we should be fighting Moors together instead of facing each other—it broke something in me. You're right. This is insane. I'm a Castilian, you're my king, we have enemies to fight, and I've been acting like a spoiled child because I didn't like how the tax bill was presented.\"\n\nHe raises his voice so his men on the walls and the townspeople can hear: \"I, Baron Alfonso de Guzmán, submit fully to King Juan II of Castile! I will pay the crusade tax—every maravedí owed! I will swear renewed fealty! I place myself and my fortress at Your Majesty's service for the holy war!\"\n\nThen, more quietly: \"And if you'll have me, Your Majesty—if you can forgive a foolish old baron's pride—I'd like to ride WITH you to Granada. Let me prove my loyalty with service rather than just words.\"\n\nThe fortress gates open fully. His soldiers begin emerging, uncertain but following their lord's lead.\n\nComplete, enthusiastic submission. Offers to actively join the crusade. Becomes potential asset rather than problem.\n\nWhen you're ready, roll d100 for Baron de Medina's response to your personal appeal."

This is exactly the kind of outcome that validates Juan's entire approach - trusting God, showing up personally, appealing to people's better nature rather than just crushing them with force.\n\nBased on the 91-100 outcome I drafted, but I should make this even MORE powerful since it's a perfect 100. The Baron should be completely transformed by Juan's personal presence and words. This should be a dramatic moment that:\n\n1. Shows Juan's approach working spectacularly\n2. Creates a powerful ally from a rebel\n3. Demonstrates to watching townspeople and soldiers\n4. Sets precedent for dealing with Count of Niebla\n5. Validates the personal risk Juan took\n\nI need to write the Baron's response in full dramatic detail, showing:\n- His immediate emotional reaction\n- His complete capitulation\n- His offer to join the crusade\n- The reaction of his men and the townspeople\n- The transformative power of Juan's personal appeal\n\nThis should be a triumphant moment. Juan rode here with 200 men, spoke truth, and won completely without firing a shot.\n\nI must NOT write any dialogue or actions for Juan - just the Baron's response and the world's reaction. Then stop and let the player decide what Juan does next.\n\nBefore you even finish speaking, before you reach the part about cannons approaching, Baron Alfonso de Guzmán's face transforms. The defiance crumbles. His eyes glisten. He actually laughs—not mockery, but the sound of a man suddenly seeing his own foolishness with painful clarity.\n\n\"Your Majesty, stop. Please.\" He holds up both hands, voice breaking. \"You came here. You—the King of Castile—rode to my gates with two hundred men when you could have sent ten thousand. You dismounted. You walked toward me. You spoke to me like... like I matter. Like my concerns are real, even though I've been an absolute fool.\"\n\nHe takes three quick steps forward, out from under his fortress walls entirely, and drops to both knees in the dirt of the square. His guards behind him freeze, uncertain. The townspeople gasp.\n\n\"I was wrong.\" His voice carries across the square, strong and clear despite the emotion in it. \"Not just wrong—I was blind. Blind with pride, with stubbornness, with the arrogance of six generations of Guzmáns holding this fortress.\" He looks up at you, tears actually streaming down his weathered face. \"When you asked how it came to this—that we should be fighting Moors together instead of facing each other across siege lines—it broke something in me, Your Majesty. Shattered it completely.\"\n\nHe raises his voice so his men on the walls, the townspeople in the square, everyone can hear: \"You're RIGHT! This is madness! You're my king! We're Castilians! We have enemies to fight—real enemies, the enemies of Christ and Castile—and instead I'm here barricaded in my own fortress like some bandit, acting like a petulant child because I didn't like how the tax bill was presented!\"\n\nThe Baron pulls off his sword belt and lays it on the ground before you—the formal gesture of complete submission. \"I, Baron Alfonso de Guzmán, Lord of Sanlúcar de Barrameda, submit fully and completely to King Juan II of Castile! I will pay the crusade tax—every single maravedí owed, and I'll pay it gladly! I will swear renewed fealty on any holy relic you choose! I place myself, my fortress, my men, my entire estate at Your Majesty's service!\"\n\nHe's openly weeping now, but his voice doesn't waver. \"And Your Majesty—if you can forgive a stubborn old fool his pride—if you can look past my rebellion and see a Castilian who wants to serve properly—then let me prove my loyalty. Let me ride WITH you to Granada. Give me a command, any command. Let me show that the Guzmáns know how to fight for Castile when we're not being idiots about taxes!\"\n\nThe fortress gates swing fully open. His soldiers—all 150 of them—begin emerging uncertainly, looking to their lord kneeling in the square. The townspeople are stunned into silence, then someone starts cheering. Then more. Within moments the entire square erupts in celebration.\n\nFrom the fortress walls, an officer calls down: \"My lord? What are your orders?\"\n\nBaron Alfonso doesn't look away from you. \"My orders? Open the gates wide! Prepare to host the King of Castile! And start gathering the tax assessment—we have eight percent to pay, and we're going to pay it properly!\" He laughs through his tears. \"And someone bring wine—we're celebrating the fact that I'm NOT an idiot anymore!\"\n\nThe townspeople are surging forward now, cheering your name. The Baron's soldiers are coming out of the fortress, confused but following their lord's lead. Some are kneeling, others cheering. The whole situation has transformed in moments from tense standoff to jubilant celebration.\n\nThe Baron remains on his knees before you, his sword belt at your feet, looking up with an expression of profound relief and gratitude. \"Thank you, Your Majesty. Thank you for coming yourself. Thank you for giving me the chance to see clearly. Thank you for...\" His voice breaks again. \"Thank you for showing me what it means to be a king who actually cares about his people, even the stubborn rebellious ones.\"\n\nBehind him, his fortress stands open and undefended. His men await your word. The town celebrates. The Infante Juan sits mounted nearby, clearly amazed at what just transpired.\n\nBaron Alfonso de Guzmán—who three minutes ago was a rebel noble in an armed fortress—is now kneeling before you in complete submission, offering not just surrender but active service in the crusade."

When you release him, he wipes his eyes roughly and turns to face his soldiers and townspeople.\n\n\"Long live King Juan!\" he roars, raising his fist to the sky.\n\nThe response is thunderous. \"LONG LIVE THE KING! LONG LIVE CASTILE!\"\n\nThe Baron's soldiers are cheering, the townspeople surging forward in celebration. Children are waving, women throwing flowers from windows. What moments ago was a tense standoff has become a festival. The Baron stands beside you, both of you acknowledging the crowd, and the noise is deafening.\n\nWhen the celebration begins to ebb slightly, the Baron's face grows more serious at your instructions. \"Toledo. Yes, of course—I must be absolved before I can serve properly.\" He nods understanding. \"My son Fernando will inherit, and I'll go to your regent immediately to make everything formal. The tax will be paid in full, Your Majesty. Within the month.\"\n\nThen his expression brightens again. \"But first—you said tomorrow we ride to convince another noble to open his gates? Count of Niebla?\" He grins fiercely. \"Diego and I are distant cousins. If he sees that I submitted—that the stubborn old Baron de Medina bent the knee—it might shake some sense into him. Let me ride with you, Your Majesty. Let me help talk him down.\"\n\nYou turn and walk back toward your escort. Infante Juan dismounts immediately, bowing. \"Your Majesty, that was... extraordinary. I've never seen anything like it.\"\n\nYou give him the orders about redirecting the siege army. The Infante nods sharply and turns to one of the cavalry captains. \"Captain Rodrigo—take three fast riders. Find the main column on the Seville road. Tell Don Rodrigo the situation: Sanlúcar has submitted without siege. The entire army is to redirect northwest to reinforce Master of Calatrava at Niebla immediately. His Majesty will join them there within three days.\"\n\nThe captain salutes and within minutes, three riders are galloping back east toward Seville at full speed.\n\nThe Infante returns to you. \"The Master of Calatrava has been at Niebla for less than a day—he'll have just begun establishing siege lines. With the main army redirected, he'll have seven thousand troops and five bombards within four days. Count of Niebla will be surrounded by overwhelming force.\"\n\nBaron Alfonso approaches, overhearing. \"Diego won't stand a chance. Not militarily. His fortress at Niebla is decent, but nothing compared to mine. And if he hears that I submitted after you came in person...\" He shakes his head. \"He's stubborn, like I was. But not stupid. When he sees the situation—when he sees that resistance is hopeless and that you're willing to grant mercy—he might listen.\"\n\nThe fortress courtyard is already being prepared for your arrival. Baron Alfonso's steward—an elderly man who looks both relieved and bewildered—is rushing about organizing accommodations. \"Your Majesty, we can house you and your escort. It's not a royal palace, but we have space, provisions, wine—\"\n\nThe Baron interrupts him. \"Break out the good wine, Miguel. All of it. Tonight we feast! Tomorrow we ride to save my idiot cousin from making my same mistake!\"\n\nThe townspeople are still celebrating in the square. Church bells are ringing. Your two hundred cavalry are being welcomed like heroes rather than invaders. The fortress that should have required a three-week siege with heavy bombardment has opened its gates after a ten-minute conversation.\n\nThe Infante Juan stands beside you, shaking his head in amazement. \"When Don Rodrigo hears about this, he won't believe it. An entire siege avoided because you rode ahead and spoke from the heart.\"\n\nIt's mid-afternoon on March 9th. Niebla is two days' ride to the northwest. The main army with the bombards should reach there by March 13th. Master of Calatrava is already there with 2,500 troops, establishing siege positions.\n\nThe Baron approaches again. \"Your Majesty, forgive me—but how many men should I bring? All 150? Or a smaller escort? And should we leave tonight or tomorrow morning?\""

And good Andalusian wine to celebrate it!\" He turns and bellows toward the fortress. \"Miguel! Bring the Jerez white—the barrels we've been saving! And the red from Ronda! Tonight we drink to His Majesty's mercy!\"\n\nHe leads you into the fortress courtyard, which is already transforming. Servants are rushing about with tables, benches appearing from storage, torches being lit even though the sun hasn't fully set. Your two hundred cavalry are being welcomed by the Baron's soldiers—men who hours ago expected to be defending these walls against siege.\n\nThe Baron's steward appears with two silver cups and a clay jug, still cool from the cellar. He pours carefully—the wine is pale gold, almost glowing in the afternoon light. Baron Alfonso takes one cup and offers it to you, then raises his own.\n\n\"To God's grace,\" he says simply. \"Which saved us both from stupidity and bloodshed.\"\n\nThe wine is excellent—crisp and dry, with a hint of salt from being aged near the sea. You can taste the Andalusian sun in it.\n\nThe Baron drinks deeply, then sighs with profound relief. \"When I saw your banner approaching, Your Majesty, my heart was in my throat. I thought—well, I thought many dark things. But you walked toward me, unarmed, speaking of fighting side by side...\" He shakes his head. \"I've been a soldier forty years. I know what courage looks like. And what you did today took more courage than any battlefield charge.\"\n\nBy now more wine is arriving, and bread, olives, cheese. Your cavalry are dismounting, being offered refreshment by the Baron's men. The townspeople are gathering in the square below, musicians appearing with guitars and drums. The celebration is building organically—people simply wanting to mark this extraordinary day.\n\nInfante Juan approaches with his own cup of wine, grinning. \"Brother, when we tell this story, no one will believe it. 'The King rode to a rebel fortress with two hundred men and the rebel surrendered after ten minutes.' It sounds like a tale from a troubadour, not real warfare.\"\n\nAs evening falls, the celebration grows. Tables are set up in the courtyard and spilling into the square. Baron Alfonso's kitchen produces roasted fish from the harbor, stewed lamb, bread, more wine. Your cavalry mingle with the Baron's soldiers—former enemies now sharing cups and stories.\n\nMusicians play—the distinctive Andalusian style, part Moorish, part Christian, guitars and hand drums creating rhythms that make people want to dance. Some of the townswomen are brave enough to approach your soldiers. Laughter echoes off the fortress walls.\n\nThe Baron stays near you throughout, still seeming unable to quite believe his fortune. At one point he leans close and says quietly, \"Your Majesty, I have a cousin at Niebla—Diego's younger brother, actually. He's been writing me letters all winter, warning me I was being a fool. Tomorrow, when we ride there? He'll be so relieved he might kiss your feet.\"\n\nThe night continues—stars emerging over the Atlantic, torches lighting the fortress, wine flowing freely but not to excess (your men remain disciplined even in celebration), food shared, songs sung. It's the celebration of peace where there could have been war, of mercy where there could have been destruction.\n\nBy late evening, proper sleeping quarters have been prepared—the Baron insisting you take his own chambers, which overlook both the harbor and the ocean beyond. The sound of waves can be heard even over the fading celebration below.\n\nThe night is still young, but tomorrow you ride for Niebla. Two days hard riding to reach the Master of Calatrava and attempt the same miracle twice."

The approach and what they see\n2. The fortress and town of Niebla\n3. Master of Calatrava's siege preparations\n4. The situation as reported by the Master\n5. NOT generate any dialogue or actions for Juan - stop when he would need to speak or act\n\nBaron Alfonso would be riding with them, which could be relevant.\n\nMARCH 10-11, 1432 - RIDE TO NIEBLA\n\nYou depart Sanlúcar at first light with your two hundred cavalry. Baron Alfonso de Guzmán rides beside you—still technically excommunicated, but determined to help convince his cousin before heading to Toledo for absolution. The vanguard moves fast through the coastal lowlands and river valleys of southwestern Andalusia.\n\nDay 1 (March 10):\n\nHard riding through familiar territory\n\nBaron Alfonso knows every village, every ford\n\nCover nearly 50 miles despite rough terrain\n\nCamp briefly that night in open country\n\nDay 2 (March 11):\n\nResume at dawn, final 30 miles\n\nArrive at Niebla late afternoon\n\nARRIVAL AT NIEBLA - MARCH 11, 1432 (Late Afternoon)\n\nAs you crest a low hill, the town of Niebla spreads before you in the valley of the Río Tinto.\n\nThe Town:\nSmaller than Sanlúcar—perhaps 1,500 inhabitants—built on Roman foundations. Ancient walls encircle both town and fortress. The river curves around the southern edge, providing natural defense. Fields and olive groves surround the settlement, but they're empty now—farmers fled or hiding inside the walls.\n\nThe Fortress:\nCount of Niebla's castle dominates the northeastern corner of the town's defenses—a solid rectangular keep with thick walls integrated into the town's Roman-era fortifications. Not as imposing as Sanlúcar's coastal fortress, but well-positioned. Four towers. Gates firmly closed. Banners flying the Guzmán arms (a different branch than Baron Alfonso's). You can see defenders on the walls—perhaps 200 men as reported.\n\nThe Siege:\nMaster of Calatrava's camp spreads across the fields north and east of the town. Military Order banners—the distinctive green cross of Calatrava—mark command tents. You estimate 2,500 troops as expected: knights, sergeants, infantry. They've been here less than two days but have already established basic siege lines.\n\nWhat You See:\n\nThe Master's forces have surrounded the town on three sides (north, east, south), leaving the western approach—toward the river—less heavily invested. Trench works are being dug. Supply wagons are organized in a fortified camp. Sentries patrol regularly. It's competent siege preparation, methodical and professional.\n\nNo assault has been attempted yet—no ladders, no rams, no bombardment (the five bombards are still with the main army, en route). The Master is clearly waiting for the artillery before attempting anything serious.\n\nAs your vanguard approaches, trumpets sound from the Master's camp. Riders emerge—scouts who recognized your white banner. Within minutes, a delegation rides out to meet you.\n\nMaster Don Luis González de Guzmán himself leads them—the same surname as the Count inside the fortress, a distant kinsman as he mentioned in Seville. He's perhaps fifty years old, stern-faced, wearing the white habit of Calatrava with its distinctive green cross. He dismounts and bows deeply.\n\n\"Your Majesty! We did not expect you so soon.\" His eyes flick to Baron Alfonso riding beside you, and his eyebrows rise. \"And Baron de Medina... not in chains?\" Confusion crosses his face. \"Did Sanlúcar require a siege? We heard nothing—\"\n\nBehind him, several other knights are staring at the Baron with equal confusion. Everyone expected weeks of bombardment at Sanlúcar, yet here is Baron Alfonso, free and armed, riding alongside the king as if nothing happened.\n\nThe Master recovers quickly. \"Forgive me, Your Majesty. Welcome to Niebla. The siege proceeds as planned—we've established positions, cut off supplies, and wait for the bombards to begin bombardment. Count Diego remains defiant inside.\" He gestures toward the fortress. \"He's refused all communication. When our heralds approached under flag of truce yesterday, crossbows fired warning shots. He means to resist.\"\n\nHe looks at you expectantly, clearly waiting for orders and very curious about what happened at Sanlúcar."

This is smart - he wants to do the same personal appeal as at Sanlúcar, but without getting shot.\n\nI should provide:\n1. Master of Calatrava's answer about crossbow range\n2. Tactical assessment of safe distance\n3. Probably Baron Alfonso's input since he knows his cousin\n4. Setup for Juan to approach and attempt parley\n\nThe Master would know crossbow effective ranges. Medieval military crossbows:\n- Maximum range: 300-400 yards\n- Effective accurate range: 150-200 yards  \n- Dangerous range even beyond that\n\nSo Juan needs to stay 250+ yards away to be relatively safe from aimed shots.\n\nI should NOT write what Juan says or does next - just provide the information he requested and set up the situation so he can decide his approach.\n\nMaster of Calatrava considers the question carefully, his military experience showing. \"Effective range for a military crossbow is perhaps 150 to 200 yards, Your Majesty. Beyond that, accuracy drops significantly. At 250 yards you'd be reasonably safe from aimed shots, though a lucky bolt could still reach you.\"\n\nHe points toward the fortress walls. \"The main gate faces northeast—our forward positions are about 300 yards out, just beyond comfortable crossbow range. From there you could be heard if you shouted, but it's... marginal. Closer would be better for communication, more dangerous for your safety.\"\n\nBaron Alfonso speaks up, frowning at the fortress. \"Diego is hot-headed, but he's not stupid. He won't shoot at his king under flag of truce. That would be...\" He hesitates. \"Well, that would be beyond rebellion into outright treason. Death sentence for his entire family, not just him.\"\n\nThe Master looks less certain. \"Baron, with respect—your cousin fired warning shots at my heralds yesterday. Men bearing the white flag and the cross of Calatrava. He's already crossed lines most nobles wouldn't dare.\"\n\n\"Warning shots,\" Baron Alfonso counters. \"Not aimed at them. There's a difference between 'stay back' and 'I'll murder you.' Diego's angry, defiant, but he's not mad. If the King of Castile rides up under white banner...\" He trails off, sounding less certain than before.\n\nOne of the Master's senior knights adds, \"Your Majesty, if you wish to parley, we could arrange it differently. Send a herald first, request formal parley, establish neutral ground between the lines. Safer than simply riding up to crossbow range.\"\n\nThe fortress remains silent and closed, about half a mile away. No movement visible on the walls beyond the usual sentries. The Count has no idea you've arrived yet—your vanguard just rode in moments ago.\n\nWhat do you want to do?"

He's been writing me all winter, begging me to see sense about the tax. Good man, level-headed, nothing like his hot-headed older brother.\"\n\nHe dismounts quickly. \"And there's more—Diego's castellan is old Rodrigo Fernández. I've known him thirty years. We fought Moors together back in the '90s. If I can get word to him, to Luis, tell them what happened at Sanlúcar...\" He looks at you with genuine hope. \"They'll listen. And if they convince Diego to at least talk before the bombardment starts, maybe we can avoid destroying another Castilian fortress.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava nods slowly. \"It's worth attempting. Better than simply riding into crossbow range and hoping they don't panic.\" He gestures toward his camp. \"We have a herald's trumpet and white banners. Baron, you could ride forward under truce flag, request to speak with your cousin Luis or the castellan. Make it personal, not official.\"\n\nBaron Alfonso is already checking his horse, adjusting his sword belt. \"I'll go now, if Your Majesty permits. Ride to the gates under white flag, call for Luis or Rodrigo by name. Tell them their king came personally to Sanlúcar, that I submitted and wasn't punished, that mercy is possible if Diego will just talk.\" He pauses. \"And that if he refuses, seven thousand men with five bombards are coming to flatten his walls. That tends to focus the mind.\"\n\nOne of the Master's knights offers a white banner on a lance. Another brings a trumpet. Baron Alfonso takes both, clearly ready to ride immediately if you give the word.\n\nThe fortress walls are perhaps 400 yards distant from this position. Close enough to be seen clearly, far enough to be relatively safe. The afternoon sun is lowering—perhaps three hours of good daylight remaining."

So there's genuine uncertainty here.\n\nLet me draft a realistic d100 table for how the fortress defenders respond to Baron Alfonso's approach:\n\nFactors to consider:\n- Flag of truce should be respected (strong medieval convention)\n- But Count already violated protocol by firing at heralds\n- Baron Alfonso is the Count's cousin - family connection\n- Luis (younger brother) and Rodrigo (castellan) are reasonable people inside\n- Count Diego is hot-headed and defiant\n- They don't know yet what happened at Sanlúcar\n- The white-armored king is visible in the distance\n- Wide variance appropriate for chaos roll\n\nI'll create a table with genuine unpredictability:\n\nCHAOS ROLL: FORTRESS RESPONSE TO BARON'S APPROACH\n\nThis is a chaotic situation with genuine unpredictability - the defenders' response depends on who sees the Baron first, how word spreads inside the fortress, and whether hot-headed Count Diego or more reasonable voices control the reaction.\n\nD100 TABLE: NIEBLA'S RESPONSE TO BARON ALFONSO'S TRUCE APPROACH\n\n1-10: VIOLENT PANIC - Crossbows Fire\n\nSentries see approaching rider, panic or misinterpret intent\n\nCrossbow bolts fly before anyone recognizes the Baron\n\nWarning shots become aimed shots in confusion\n\nBaron wounded or horse killed, forced to retreat/take cover\n\nCount Diego's voice heard shouting orders to cease fire - too late\n\nCreates genuine crisis: king's emissary shot under truce flag\n\nComplication: Now impossible to negotiate, assault inevitable\n\nLegal implication: Treason, not just rebellion\n\n11-25: HOSTILE REFUSAL - No Violence But Complete Rejection\n\nGuards recognize Baron Alfonso, refuse to let him approach\n\n\"Stay back! We don't want your surrender! Leave!\"\n\nCount Diego appears on walls, shouts defiance\n\n\"You bent the knee, cousin? Coward! I'll die first!\"\n\nRefuses all communication, orders gates sealed\n\nNo shooting, but absolute rejection of negotiation\n\nResult: Parley impossible, Count committed to resistance\n\n26-45: SUSPICIOUS STANDOFF - They Listen But Don't Commit\n\nGuards challenge Baron at 150 yards: \"State your business!\"\n\nBaron shouts about Sanlúcar, about mercy, about talking\n\nLong silence, then castellan Rodrigo appears on walls\n\n\"Alfonso? Is that really you? What happened?\"\n\nBrief shouted conversation across distance\n\nCastellan says he'll consult with Count, gives no promises\n\nBaron returns having made contact but with no agreement\n\nResult: Door opened slightly, but no commitment yet\n\n46-65: CAUTIOUS INTEREST - Request for Formal Parley\n\nGuards recognize Baron, hold fire, send for castellan\n\nOld Rodrigo appears on walls: \"Alfonso! You're alive!\"\n\nShouted conversation about Sanlúcar submission\n\nRodrigo clearly shocked: \"You submitted? And they let you ride free?\"\n\nInternal commotion visible - people arguing on walls\n\nRodrigo: \"Wait there. I need to speak with the Count. This changes things.\"\n\n30 minutes later: \"Count Diego will grant audience. Neutral ground. You and one other. Tomorrow dawn.\"\n\nResult: Formal parley arranged, genuine negotiation possible\n\n66-80: POSITIVE RESPONSE - Younger Brother Luis Emerges\n\nLuis (Count's younger brother, Baron's cousin) appears quickly\n\n\"Alfonso! Thank God! I heard what happened - is it true?\"\n\nVisible relief and excitement in his voice\n\n\"I've been trying to talk sense into Diego for months!\"\n\nLuis disappears inside - sounds of heated argument\n\nReturns: \"Diego will see you. Tonight. Bring the king's representative.\"\n\nOpens small postern gate, escorts provided\n\nResult: Direct meeting arranged, Luis clearly working to convince Diego\n\n81-92: ENTHUSIASTIC RECEPTION - Castellan Takes Control\n\nOld castellan Rodrigo recognizes Baron immediately\n\n\"Alfonso! You old fool, you finally saw sense!\"\n\nGates actually open partially - castellan emerges with small escort\n\nMeets Baron in the field, embraces him\n\n\"Diego's been impossible. Tell me everything about Sanlúcar.\"\n\nAfter hearing story: \"Wait here. If the king came personally...\"\n\nReturns to fortress, sounds of shouting (Rodrigo arguing with Count)\n\nAn hour later: Luis appears with Rodrigo\n\n\"The Count will receive the king. Tomorrow. Formal parley. He's... considering.\"\n\nResult: Internal faction supporting negotiation gaining strength\n\n93-100: IMMEDIATE CAPITULATION - Internal Coup\n\nBaron's approach triggers crisis inside fortress\n\nLuis and Rodrigo see opportunity, act decisively\n\nGates open, Luis emerges with 20 knights\n\n\"Alfonso! Thank God you came! Diego's been impossible!\"\n\nReveals: \"Half the garrison wants to submit. Diego's been holding us hostage to his pride.\"\n\n\"When we heard the king was at Sanlúcar personally, that you submitted without punishment...\"\n\nLuis makes decision: \"I'm taking command. Diego can come around or be confined.\"\n\nOffers immediate submission, requests king's presence to formalize\n\nCount Diego effectively overthrown by his own brother and castellan\n\nResult: Fortress surrenders immediately, internal politics resolved the problem\n\nRoll d100 for the fortress's response to Baron Alfonso's approach under flag of truce."

Let me create a realistic table for the outcome of crossbow fire at a mounted rider approaching under flag of truce.\n\nThe Baron is riding toward the fortress under white flag, probably at around 200-300 yards when the shooting starts. Crossbows at that range - some bolts will miss wildly, some might hit, it depends on luck and how many shoot.\n\nI need to create a d100 table with realistic outcomes ranging from:\n- Low rolls: Baron killed or seriously wounded\n- Mid rolls: Horse hit, Baron wounded but survives\n- High rolls: Near misses, Baron escapes unharmed but shaken\n\nThis should be a genuine chaos roll with real danger. Medieval crossbows were lethal weapons, and panic fire from multiple defenders could be very dangerous even at medium range.\n\nCHAOS ROLL: BARON ALFONSO UNDER CROSSBOW FIRE\n\nThe Baron is riding toward the fortress under white flag when panicked or hostile defenders open fire. Multiple crossbow bolts at 200-300 yards range - some will miss wildly, but volleys are dangerous even at distance.\n\nD100 TABLE: OUTCOME OF CROSSBOW VOLLEY\n\n1-8: FATAL STRIKE - Baron Killed\n\nMultiple bolts fired in panic\n\nOne strikes Baron in neck/chest/face (unarmored areas)\n\nFalls from horse immediately, clearly mortal wound\n\nDies within minutes despite attempts to help\n\nHorse bolts back toward your lines\n\nCatastrophic outcome: King's emissary murdered under truce flag\n\nLegal implication: Undeniable treason, Count Diego's entire family doomed\n\nStrategic: Assault inevitable, no mercy possible\n\n9-20: CRITICAL WOUND - Baron Seriously Injured\n\nBolt strikes Baron in shoulder, side, or leg\n\nPenetrates mail/gambeson, serious bleeding\n\nBaron reels in saddle, barely stays mounted\n\nManages to turn horse and retreat, but clearly badly hurt\n\nCollapses when reaching your lines\n\nOutcome: Survives but needs immediate medical attention\n\nRecovery: Weeks or months, may never fully recover\n\nPolitical: Attempted murder under truce flag, Count Diego culpable\n\n21-35: SIGNIFICANT WOUND - Baron Injured But Functional\n\nBolt grazes Baron's arm, leg, or side\n\nPainful wound, bleeding, but not life-threatening\n\nBaron stays in saddle, retreats under continued fire\n\nArrow in his shield/armor, visible proof of attack\n\nReaches your lines, needs bandaging but can speak\n\nOutcome: Wounded but survives, will recover in days/weeks\n\nPolitical: Clear violation of truce, but Baron can testify\n\n36-50: HORSE STRUCK - Baron Unhorsed But Uninjured\n\nBolts miss Baron but strike his horse\n\nHorse screams, rears, throws Baron or collapses\n\nBaron hits ground hard, stunned and winded\n\nMust scramble back on foot while more bolts fly\n\nYour cavalry charges forward to cover his retreat/rescue him\n\nOutcome: Baron shaken, bruised, but physically unharmed\n\nComplication: Dramatic rescue needed, possible escalation\n\n51-65: NEAR MISSES - Baron Retreats Under Fire\n\nMultiple bolts fly, several very close\n\nOne strikes his shield, another his saddle\n\nHorse panics from bolts striking ground around them\n\nBaron wheels and gallops back, clearly under attack\n\nBolts continue flying as he retreats - harrowing ride\n\nOutcome: Uninjured but badly shaken, clear assassination attempt\n\nEvidence: Bolts in shield/saddle prove hostile intent\n\n66-80: WARNING SHOTS - Deliberately Missing\n\nCrossbows fire but bolts land short or wide\n\nPattern suggests intentional warning, not aimed shots\n\n\"Stay back! Come no closer!\" shouted from walls\n\nBaron recognizes warning nature, retreats cautiously\n\nNo actual attempt to hit him, just intimidation\n\nOutcome: Hostile but not murderous, unclear if Count ordered it\n\n81-92: CONFUSION AND CEASE FIRE - Shooting Stops Quickly\n\nInitial panicked shots fired (2-3 bolts)\n\nAll miss as shouting erupts from fortress walls\n\nOfficer's voice: \"CEASE FIRE! Cease fire, you fools!\"\n\nShooting stops immediately, clear someone took control\n\nBaron halts, uncertain, as fortress goes silent\n\nVoice calls out: \"Baron Alfonso? Is that you?\"\n\nOutcome: Panic controlled, possible parley still viable\n\n93-100: SINGLE SHOT THEN INTERVENTION - No Real Danger\n\nOne nervous sentry fires a single bolt (misses widely)\n\nImmediate shouting from walls: \"Who fired? Stand down!\"\n\nCastellan's voice roaring: \"Do NOT shoot the Baron!\"\n\nGates actually open slightly, officer emerges waving apologies\n\nClear the shooter acted alone and was immediately countermanded\n\n\"Baron Alfonso! Apologies - new recruit panicked. Please approach!\"\n\nOutcome: Incident contained, actually helps as it shows internal control\n\nThis is a genuine danger moment.

He's perhaps 250 yards from the main gate when movement erupts on the walls.\n\nThree crossbow bolts fly simultaneously.\n\nThe distinctive thwack-thwack-thwack of release, then the whistling flight. One bolt strikes the ground ten yards ahead of the Baron's horse, kicking up dust. Another passes overhead with a sound like tearing cloth. The third goes wide left, nowhere close.\n\nThe Baron's horse rears in panic. He controls it expertly, decades of cavalry experience keeping him in the saddle, but he's clearly shaken. The white banner dips as he struggles with the reins.\n\nThen shouting erupts from the fortress walls—loud, angry, commanding:\n\n\"CEASE FIRE! CEASE FIRE, YOU FOOLS!\"\n\nThe voice carries clearly across the distance—older, authoritative, furious. More voices join in: \"Stand down! Lower your weapons! Who gave the order to shoot?\"\n\nThe Baron has halted his horse, frozen in place about 230 yards from the walls. He's holding the white banner high again, but not advancing—waiting to see if more bolts will fly.\n\nThe walls have gone suddenly, completely silent. You can see figures moving rapidly—officers grabbing soldiers, weapons being pulled down, what looks like someone being physically dragged away from a firing position.\n\nThen, after perhaps thirty seconds that feel much longer, a new voice calls out from the walls. Different from the angry officer—calmer, older:\n\n\"Baron Alfonso? Is that... is that you?\"\n\nThe Baron sits frozen on his horse, clearly uncertain whether to answer, advance, or retreat. He glances back toward your position—you can see his face even at this distance. He's pale, shaken, but unharmed.\n\nBehind you, the Master of Calatrava has already ordered knights to mount, ready to charge forward if needed. Infante Juan's hand is on his sword. The entire camp has gone tense, watching.\n\nThe fortress walls remain silent, waiting. No more shots. But the gates stay firmly closed. Someone on the walls—you can't make out who—is clearly visible, standing at a crenel, apparently waiting for a response.\n\nThe Baron sits on his nervous horse in the middle of no-man's-land, white banner still raised, looking back at you for guidance.\n\nWhat do you do?"

He makes the sign of the cross, adjusts his grip on the white banner, and urges his horse forward again—slowly, deliberately, the banner held high.\n\nYour escort watches in tense silence. The Master of Calatrava mutters a prayer under his breath. Infante Juan sits rigid on his horse beside you.\n\nThe Baron advances another fifty yards. Then another. Now he's within 180 yards—well within effective crossbow range if anyone chose to fire. But the walls remain silent.\n\nWhen he reaches perhaps 150 yards, the voice calls out again—clearer now, and you recognize it. The older, authoritative tone that stopped the shooting:\n\n\"Alfonso! It's Rodrigo! Old Rodrigo Fernández! Stop there, cousin—no closer until I sort this madness out!\"\n\nThe Baron reins in, calling back: \"Rodrigo? What in God's name is happening? I came under flag of truce and you shoot at me?\"\n\n\"Not me, you old fool!\" The castellan's voice is furious but not directed at the Baron. \"Some panicked idiots on the walls! The Count didn't order it—nobody ordered it! Just... wait there! I need to get control of this situation!\"\n\nThe Baron remains mounted at 150 yards, banner still high. You can hear shouting from within the fortress—muffled but heated. It goes on for several minutes. Then the gate opens—not fully, just a narrow gap—and a single figure emerges.\n\nAn older man, gray-bearded, wearing mail and a surcoat. He walks toward the Baron, alone and unarmed, hands spread wide to show he carries no weapons. When he reaches the Baron, they clasp hands—clearly old friends.\n\nTheir conversation is too distant to hear clearly, but you can see the castellan gesturing back toward the fortress, shaking his head, obviously explaining what happened. The Baron is speaking rapidly, pointing back toward you and your banner.\n\nAfter perhaps five minutes, both men turn and look toward your position. The castellan raises his voice to carry across the field:\n\n\"Your Majesty! I am Rodrigo Fernández, castellan of Niebla! I apologize for the shooting—it was not ordered! Young fools who panicked!\" A pause. \"Count Diego requests... he asks if Your Majesty would grant formal parley. Tomorrow at dawn. Neutral ground between the lines. The Count, yourself, and chosen representatives.\"\n\nThe Baron and castellan stand together at 150 yards, waiting for your response. Behind them, the fortress gate remains slightly open. Faces visible on the walls—watching, waiting.\n\nWhat do you do?"

The castellan calls something to the Baron, they clasp hands once more, then Rodrigo walks back toward the fortress gate. It closes behind him with an audible thud.\n\nBaron Alfonso rides back toward your lines, and when he reaches you, he's visibly shaken but trying to hide it. \"Your Majesty, Rodrigo swears the Count didn't order the shooting. Some nervous sentries saw movement and panicked. Rodrigo has them in chains now.\" He pauses. \"But Diego agreed to parley. That's... that's more than I expected after being shot at.\"\n\nYou turn to the Master of Calatrava. His face is stern, clearly displeased by what just happened. \"No hostile actions until we have had the parley.\"\n\nThe Master bows stiffly. \"As Your Majesty commands. Though I must note—shooting at a herald under flag of truce, even accidentally, is a grave offense. Count Diego's control over his men appears... questionable.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" you reply firmly. \"No action until dawn.\"\n\n\"Understood, Your Majesty. We will maintain positions but initiate nothing.\" He gestures toward his camp. \"I have a command tent prepared for you. Not luxurious, but serviceable. And we have provisions—bread, dried meat, wine. You and your escort are welcome.\"\n\nEVENING - MARCH 11, 1432\n\nThe Master's camp is well-organized and professional. Military Order discipline shows in everything—neat rows of tents, organized supply wagons, regular patrols, sentries properly posted. Your escort is given space near the command tent, horses seen to, provisions distributed.\n\nThe evening meal is simple but adequate—military fare, not a feast. The Baron joins you, still rattled by his experience but trying to maintain composure. The Infante sits quietly, watching the fortress walls in the gathering darkness.\n\n\"Diego's in a bad position,\" Baron Alfonso observes, chewing bread thoughtfully. \"Seven thousand men coming with bombards, his king offering personal parley before the assault. If he has any sense at all...\" He trails off. \"But Diego's always been proud. Stubborn. Like I was.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava adds, \"The shooting incident may actually help, Your Majesty. It demonstrated that his control is slipping, that his men are nervous. A competent commander keeps discipline. Those crossbows firing without orders? That's a garrison coming apart.\"\n\nAs night falls, watch fires are lit around the siege lines. The fortress remains dark and silent across the field. Somewhere in there, Count Diego is presumably deciding what to say at tomorrow's parley—whether to submit like his cousin or resist to the death.\n\nYou retire to the command tent. Simple camp bed, oil lamp, maps spread on a folding table. Through the tent flap you can see stars emerging, and in the distance, the dark silhouette of Niebla's walls.\n\nMARCH 12, 1432 - DAWN\n\nYou wake before first light. Servants help you into your white armor—every piece polished and gleaming. When you emerge from the tent, the camp is already stirring. The Master of Calatrava is in full battle dress, his white Calatrava habit spotless over his armor. Baron Alfonso looks exhausted—clearly didn't sleep well after yesterday's experience. The Infante Juan is checking his weapons with practiced efficiency.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" the Master says formally. \"The parley ground has been prepared—200 yards from both our lines and theirs. Neutral territory. I recommend you bring the Infante, Baron Alfonso as witness to Sanlúcar, myself representing the Military Orders, and perhaps four guards. Count Diego will likely bring similar numbers.\"\n\nAs dawn breaks—soft gray light spreading across the fields—movement appears at the fortress gate. It opens slowly, and a small group emerges. Perhaps eight men total, one clearly the Count himself based on the richness of his armor and the banner carried before him.\n\nThey walk toward the agreed meeting point—an open field equidistant between the siege lines and the fortress walls. A white banner is planted in the ground there, marking neutral ground.\n\nThe Master looks at you. \"Your Majesty, we should move now. Dawn is upon us.\"\n\nYour party—you, the Infante, Baron Alfonso, the Master, and four guards—begins walking across the field toward the parley point. The Count's party approaches from the opposite direction. As you get closer, you can make out details:\n\nCount Diego de Guzmán is perhaps forty years old, dark-bearded, wearing fine plate armor. His face is set in rigid lines—pride and anger barely contained. Beside him walks the castellan Rodrigo, looking worried. A younger man—probably Luis, the Count's brother—stays close to Diego's other side. Five guards in mail complete their party.\n\nThe two groups stop about ten paces apart, on either side of the white banner planted in the dawn-damp grass. The sun is just cresting the horizon, casting long shadows.\n\nCount Diego doesn't kneel. Doesn't bow. He stands rigid, jaw clenched, staring at you with barely controlled fury.\n\nThe silence stretches."

His face flushes red, veins standing out on his neck.\n\n\"What's going on?\" He takes a step forward, hand moving toward his sword before his brother grabs his arm. \"What's going on is TYRANNY! You and your marshals and your taxes treating ancient houses like we're peasants to be bled dry!\"\n\nHe's shouting now, spittle flying. \"My family held this fortress when yours was begging scraps from Trastámara pretenders! And you dare—you DARE—come here and ask what drove me to this?\"\n\nThe success factors—your presence, the military reality, Baron Alfonso's example—are completely drowned out by rage and wounded pride. \"Yesterday my men fired? GOOD! They should have aimed better! You want Niebla? Come take it! I'll die on these walls before I bend knee to you!\"\n\nHis brother Luis is physically restraining him now. The castellan looks horrified. The parley is disintegrating into a screaming match.\n\nNegotiation impossible. Diego has lost all control. Assault inevitable.\n\n13-28: HOSTILE DEFIANCE - Failure Factors Dominate\n\nDiego's face is stone. When you finish, he laughs—bitter and harsh.\n\n\"What drove me? Your arrogance, Majesty.\" The title drips with sarcasm. \"You send bureaucrats—Crown Marshals!—to dictate terms to lords who've held their lands for centuries. Then when I refuse your extortion, you excommunicate me like some heretic. And now you ride here personally and expect me to grovel?\"\n\nHe acknowledges the success factors but dismisses them: \"Yes, you came yourself. Very noble. Yes, my idiot cousin submitted—and I'm sure he'll regret it when he's penniless from your taxes. Yes, you have an army coming. Congratulations on threatening Castilian nobles with Castilian soldiers.\"\n\nAbout the shooting: \"My men were nervous. They fired warning shots. No one was hurt. Don't pretend it's some great crime when you're preparing to bombard my home.\"\n\nHe crosses his arms. \"I know my position. I know you'll probably take Niebla eventually. But I'm not submitting because you showed up and asked nicely. Some things matter more than survival—like honor, like principle, like not letting kings become tyrants.\"\n\nThe military reality and your presence ARE acknowledged, but his pride and anger override everything.\n\nRefuses negotiation. Will resist until forced. Sees this as matter of principle.\n\n29-48: DEFENSIVE JUSTIFICATION - Failure Factors Lead\n\nDiego's jaw works as you speak. When you finish, he responds with controlled anger:\n\n\"You want to know what's going on, Your Majesty? I'll tell you.\" His voice is tight. \"For decades my family has served Castile faithfully. We've paid our taxes, sent our men, defended this frontier. And then in one year—ONE year—you demand eight percent on top of everything else. Eight percent! Do you understand what that means to an estate like mine?\"\n\nHe gestures sharply. \"And when I questioned it—not refused, questioned it—your marshals arrived like I was some criminal. No negotiation, no consideration of my financial situation, just 'pay or face consequences.' The Church excommunicated me without hearing my side. And now you bring an army.\"\n\nAbout the shooting incident, he's clearly embarrassed but defensive: \"That was a mistake. Young soldiers who panicked. I've punished them. But don't act like it's proof I'm some madman when you're besieging my home.\"\n\nHe acknowledges your presence grudgingly: \"Yes, you came personally. That's... unexpected. And yes, Baron Alfonso submitted. But he's not me. His estates are richer, his situation different.\"\n\nThe success factors—your gesture, the military reality—are acknowledged but he focuses on the injustice he feels. His pride is wounded but he's not completely irrational.\n\nMight negotiate if terms address his concerns. Needs to save face and feel heard.\n\n49-65: CONFLICTED STRUGGLE - Both Factors Balanced\n\nDiego stares at you for a long moment, emotions warring across his face. When he speaks, his voice is strained:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you ask what drove me to this? I...\" He stops, starts again. \"I don't know anymore. It started with the tax—eight percent felt impossible, felt like punishment. Then your marshals came, and I was angry about how they presented it. Then the excommunication, and I was furious. And then...\"\n\nHe gestures helplessly. \"And then I was in too deep to back out without looking like a coward. So I fortified. Hired men. Prepared to resist. Because what else could I do? Submit and be humiliated? Made an example of?\"\n\nAbout the shooting: \"That was a disaster. I didn't order it. Some fool sentries panicked, and now...\" He shakes his head. \"Now it looks like I'm some treasonous madman who fires on heralds.\"\n\nHe looks at Baron Alfonso. \"When I heard you submitted, cousin, I thought you were weak. But then I heard you rode WITH the king, that you weren't punished, that...\" He trails off. \"Maybe I was wrong.\"\n\nThen back to you: \"I'm trapped, Your Majesty. My pride won't let me just surrender after all this. But I'm not stupid—I know you'll take Niebla eventually. Those bombards will flatten these walls. And my men...\" He glances at his brother and castellan. \"My own people want me to submit.\"\n\nThe success and failure factors are in genuine tension. He sees the reality but can't overcome his pride without help.\n\nGenuinely torn. Needs a way to submit that preserves some dignity.\n\n66-80: STRAINED RECEPTIVITY - Success Factors Gaining\n\nDiego's face shows the strain of the past months. Your questions seem to deflate something in him.\n\n\"What drove me to this?\" He laughs—not bitter, just exhausted. \"Stupidity, Your Majesty. Pride. Fear of looking weak. Take your pick.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"The tax IS heavy—I wasn't lying about that. But you're right that I rebuffed your marshals. I was angry, felt disrespected, and I refused to listen. Then the excommunication, and I was in too deep.\" A pause. \"And yesterday's shooting... God, that was a nightmare. I didn't order it. Some panicked idiots nearly killed Baron Alfonso, and now it looks like I'm firing on parley flags.\"\n\nHe gestures at your presence. \"And then you show up. The King of Castile, personally, to talk to a minor count in a nothing fortress. You could have just sent the army to flatten us. But you're here, asking what's wrong, like...\" He struggles for words. \"Like I'm a person worth talking to, not just a rebel to be crushed.\"\n\nLooking at Baron Alfonso: \"Cousin, they really let you submit without punishment? No humiliation? Just... pay the tax and move on?\"\n\nThe Baron nods. \"More than that, Diego. I'm riding with him to Granada. Given a chance to serve.\"\n\nDiego absorbs this. The success factors—your presence, the mercy shown, the military reality—are resonating strongly. But his pride still struggles.\n\n\"If I submit now, Your Majesty... will it be like my cousin? Or will I be made an example? Because I need to know.\"\n\nVery receptive. Needs clear reassurance about treatment. One more push could secure submission.\n\n81-92: WILLING SUBMISSION - Success Factors Dominate\n\nDiego's shoulders slump as you finish speaking. He looks at the ground, then back up at you.\n\n\"Your Majesty is right about all of it.\" His voice is quiet but steady. \"I rebuffed your marshals out of pride. I refused the Church out of stubbornness. And yesterday...\" He winces. \"Yesterday my garrison nearly killed Baron Alfonso because I've lost control of my own men. Everything you said is true.\"\n\nHe takes a breath. \"When I started this, I convinced myself it was about principle. About noble rights, about unjust taxation. But the truth?\" He looks at you directly. \"The truth is I was angry and proud, and I let that override my judgment. The tax IS heavy, but it's not unjust. The crusade is legitimate. And I...\" He shakes his head. \"I should have been part of it, not fighting against it.\"\n\nHe steps forward, closer to you. \"Baron Alfonso told me what happened at Sanlúcar—that you came personally, that you offered mercy, that he's riding with you now to Granada. I didn't believe it. Thought it was a trick. But here you are, doing it again. Coming to talk before you destroy me.\"\n\nHis brother Luis is nodding encouragement. The castellan looks relieved.\n\n\"I submit, Your Majesty. Fully, completely. I'll pay the tax—all of it, with whatever penalties are owed for my defiance. I'll swear renewed fealty. I'll accept whatever judgment you impose.\" His voice strengthens. \"But if there's any mercy available—if you can grant even a fraction of what you gave my cousin—then I swear I'll serve faithfully going forward. Give me the chance to prove it.\"\n\nComplete submission. Willing to accept penalties. Asks for chance to serve like Baron Alfonso.\n\n93-100: EMOTIONAL CAPITULATION - Success Factors Triumph\n\nYou barely finish your questions before Diego raises his hand, stopping you. His face works through emotions—anger, shame, relief—before he speaks.\n\n\"Your Majesty, please. Stop.\" His voice cracks slightly. \"You're right. About everything. I have no excuse, no justification that makes sense anymore.\"\n\nHe drops to one knee right there in the field. His guards look shocked. His brother and castellan immediately kneel beside him.\n\n\"I was a fool. A proud, stupid fool who let wounded dignity override duty and sense.\" He looks up at you, eyes glistening. \"The tax is legitimate. The marshals had authority. The excommunication was deserved. And yesterday—God forgive me—my men nearly murdered Baron Alfonso under flag of truce because I've created such chaos that I can't even control my own garrison.\"\n\nHis voice grows stronger, more urgent: \"When my cousin told me what happened at Sanlúcar—that the King of Castile himself came to talk, offered mercy, treated him like a man worth saving—I thought it was impossible. Kings don't do that. Kings send armies and executioners. But here you are. Again. Doing the impossible. Giving me a chance I don't deserve.\"\n\nHe pulls off his sword belt and lays it before you. \"I submit completely, Your Majesty. The fortress is yours. My men are yours. Whatever tax I owe—pay it double as penalty for my stupidity. Whatever service you require—I'll give it gladly. Just...\" His voice breaks. \"Just let me make this right. Let me serve Castile properly. Let me be part of this crusade instead of fighting against it.\"\n\nBehind him, the fortress gates are opening. Soldiers emerging, clearly his brother and castellan sent word during the parley. The entire garrison is standing down.\n\n\"Please, Your Majesty. Give this stubborn old fool the same chance you gave Baron Alfonso. I swear I won't waste it.\"\n\nComplete, emotional surrender. Fortress opening without further action. Offers enhanced payments as penance.\n\nRoll d100 for Count Diego's reaction to your confrontation."

When you finish, he takes a sharp breath, and his response comes with controlled but visible anger:\n\n\"You want to know what's going on, Your Majesty? I'll tell you exactly what's going on.\"\n\nHis voice is tight, measured, but there's fury beneath it. \"For thirty years my family has served Castile faithfully. We've paid our taxes—every maravedí demanded. We've sent our men to every campaign, defended this frontier, bled for this kingdom. My father died fighting Moors. My uncle died fighting Moors. The Guzmáns have earned their place.\"\n\nHe gestures sharply toward the siege lines. \"And then in one year—ONE year—you demand eight percent on top of everything else. Eight percent! Your Majesty, do you understand what that means for estates like mine? Not the great houses with endless resources—the lesser nobility who actually work our lands, manage our people, maintain our fortresses with our own funds?\"\n\nHis face flushes. \"And when I questioned it—not refused, questioned—your Crown Marshals arrived like I was some criminal. Not nobles negotiating with nobles. Not representatives offering to discuss terms. Bureaucrats with fancy titles demanding compliance like I was some merchant haggling over wool prices.\"\n\nAbout the marshals, his voice grows more bitter: \"They didn't ask about my financial situation. Didn't discuss phased payments or adjustments. Just: 'Pay the tax or face consequences.' As if decades of loyal service meant nothing. As if the Guzmán name meant nothing.\"\n\nThen the excommunication: \"And when I balked at that treatment—when I said I needed time to consult my stewards, to understand how to manage this burden—the Church excommunicated me. No hearing. No chance to explain my position. No consideration that maybe, maybe, I had legitimate concerns rather than just being a rebel.\"\n\nHe's breathing hard now, the accumulated grievances pouring out. \"And now you bring an army. Seven thousand men and bombards to destroy my home because I had the audacity to question whether this taxation was fair.\"\n\nAbout the shooting incident, his face tightens with embarrassment but he remains defensive: \"Yesterday was a disaster, yes. Young soldiers who panicked when they saw movement. I've had them whipped and confined. But don't act like it's proof I'm some treasonous madman when you're preparing to bombard my family's home of four generations.\"\n\nHe looks at Baron Alfonso, and there's genuine confusion in his expression. \"You submitted, cousin. And apparently you weren't punished, which...\" He trails off, then back to you. \"Which is more than I expected, I'll grant you that. Your Majesty coming personally is also... unexpected.\"\n\nHe's clearly struggling, the success factors—your presence, Baron Alfonso's example, the military reality—acknowledged but still overridden by wounded pride and perceived injustice.\n\n\"But here's the thing, Your Majesty: I'm not my cousin. My estates aren't as rich. My situation isn't as simple. And after months of being treated like a criminal, after excommunication, after having an army sent to my gates...\" His voice drops. \"How do I know that if I submit now, I won't just be made an example? That this isn't about crushing me publicly to show what happens to nobles who question royal authority?\"\n\nHe's not refusing outright. Not threatening. But he's not submitting either. He stands rigid, arms at his sides, looking at you with a mixture of anger, fear, and exhausted defiance.\n\n\"So tell me, Your Majesty—if I open those gates, if I pay this impossible tax, if I bend the knee after all this—what happens to me? To my family? To my lands? Because I need to know this isn't just about humiliation and ruin dressed up as mercy.\"\n\nHe's waiting for your response. His brother Luis looks like he wants to say something but doesn't dare. The castellan Rodrigo stands silent, clearly hoping you can find words that will break through Diego's defensive wall.\n\nThe dawn sun is fully risen now, casting light across the field. The two parties stand facing each other, the white banner of parley fluttering between them."

They specifically said eight percent crusade tax on top of—\"\n\nHe cuts himself off, turning to his castellan. \"Rodrigo, what exactly did the marshals say?\"\n\nThe old castellan looks uncomfortable. \"My lord, they said eight percent total obligation, but I thought... I understood it was five percent crusade tax plus three percent—\" He trails off, clearly realizing the miscommunication.\n\nDiego's face has gone pale. \"And it replaces the crown tax? Not in addition to?\" His voice is barely a whisper now. \"Mother of God. I thought... we calculated eight percent on top of existing obligations. That would have been...\" He does quick mental arithmetic, and the color drains further from his face.\n\nThen your words about compensation for levies register. \"Generous compensation? For providing troops?\" He looks genuinely stunned. \"The marshals never mentioned that. They just demanded payment. They never said—\"\n\nHe's clearly reeling, the financial justification for his rebellion crumbling before his eyes.\n\n\"And you summoned me to Toledo?\" His voice is hollow now. \"I... I received a summons, yes, but after the excommunication, I assumed it was for arrest and trial, not discussion. I thought—\" He stops, the full weight of his mistake becoming clear.\n\nHe turns to Baron Alfonso, and there's desperate hope in his voice. \"Cousin. Tell me. What happened at Sanlúcar? What terms did His Majesty offer?\"\n\nBaron Alfonso steps forward, his voice steady and clear:\n\n\"Diego, three days ago I was exactly where you are now. Barricaded in my fortress, convinced the king was coming to destroy me, certain that submission meant ruin and humiliation.\" He gestures toward you. \"His Majesty rode to my gates with two hundred men. Not ten thousand. Two hundred. And he walked toward me, in the open, and spoke to me like I was a man worth saving rather than a rebel to be crushed.\"\n\nThe Baron's voice grows more emotional. \"He told me the same things he just told you—about the tax being reasonable, about the crusade needing unity, about us being Castilians who should fight together. And Diego...\" He pauses. \"He was right. About everything. I'd convinced myself I was defending principle, but I was really just being a stubborn, prideful fool.\"\n\nHe takes a breath. \"So I submitted. Right there, in front of my men and the townspeople. Dropped to my knees and swore fealty. And you know what happened?\"\n\nBaron Alfonso gestures to himself, clearly unharmed and free. \"He accepted my submission. No humiliation. No punishment. No confiscation of lands. I pay the five percent—just the five percent, which honestly isn't crushing when you understand it replaces other obligations. I go to Toledo for the Archbishop to lift my excommunication. My son inherits my estates as planned.\"\n\nHis voice strengthens. \"And more than that—His Majesty asked me to ride WITH him. To help convince you, yes, but also to serve in the crusade going forward. He's giving me the chance to prove my loyalty through service rather than just words. Diego, he trusts me after I rebelled against him. Do you understand how extraordinary that is?\"\n\nThe Baron steps closer to his cousin. \"The terms I was offered? Submit fully. Pay the actual tax—five percent, with compensation if I provide troops. Swear renewed fealty. Go to Toledo for absolution. And then...\" He smiles slightly. \"And then serve Castile properly. Be part of finishing the Reconquista instead of fighting against it.\"\n\nHe places a hand on Diego's shoulder. \"Cousin, you're making the same mistake I made. You've convinced yourself the burden is impossible, that the king is a tyrant, that submission means destruction. But it's not true. None of it is true. His Majesty came HERE, to YOU, the same way he came to me. He's offering you the same chance he gave me.\"\n\nBaron Alfonso's voice drops, more intimate. \"Don't throw your life away over a misunderstanding about tax rates. Don't force him to bombard your home when he's standing here offering mercy. I was ready to die on my walls three days ago, and thank God I didn't. Thank God I listened. Please, Diego. Listen now.\"\n\nCount Diego stands frozen, processing everything. His brother Luis speaks up quietly: \"My lord, I've been trying to tell you for months that the numbers didn't add up. That maybe we misunderstood—\"\n\n\"Be silent, Luis,\" Diego snaps, but there's no real heat in it. He's staring at you now, and at Baron Alfonso, and the defensive anger is cracking, revealing fear and confusion underneath.\n\n\"Five percent,\" he repeats, almost to himself. \"Replaces crown tax. Compensation for levies. No punishment for submission.\" He looks at you directly. \"Your Majesty, if this is true—if I've been fighting over a misunderstanding—then I've...\"\n\nHe can't finish the sentence. The full scope of his mistake is settling over him like a weight.\n\nHis brother and castellan are watching him intently. The guards on both sides remain silent. The moment stretches.\n\n\"I need...\" Diego's voice is shaky. \"I need to understand clearly. If I submit now. What exactly are the terms? Because I've been fighting this for months based on information that was apparently wrong, and I need to know—truly know—what happens if I open those gates.\"\n\nHe's not submitting yet.

That's not mercy, that's calculated humiliation.\" Refuses terms, will resist.\n\n31-48: CONFLICTED RESISTANCE\nDiego clearly sees the tax terms are fair, but struggles intensely with title loss. \"The lands matter, yes, but being Count is WHO I AM. You're asking me to live as a ghost in my own home while my son rules.\" Doesn't refuse outright but can't accept. Asks for time to consider.\n\n49-65: PAINFUL CONSIDERATION\nDiego is clearly torn.

Despite all the reasonable terms, despite the tax clarification, despite Baron Alfonso's example - when Juan mentions stripping the title, Diego loses it completely. His pride cannot handle this. He explodes in rage.\n\nI need to write this dramatically and realistically. Diego has been teetering on the edge, the tax clarification was helping, but when Juan said \"you will be a Count no more\" - that was the breaking point. For a proud noble who has identified as Count for years, who sees his title as his identity, this is unbearable.\n\nThe explosion should be sudden, visceral, and destroy any chance of negotiation. Diego storms off. The parley ends in failure. The siege will have to proceed.\n\nThis is tragic - Juan offered genuinely fair terms, but Diego's pride simply cannot accept the loss of title even with all the other mercy. Sometimes even the best efforts fail.\n\nCount Diego's face goes through a transformation as you speak. When you show him the Cortes documents, when you explain the 5% clearly replacing the crown tax, there's visible relief—even hope—dawning in his expression. The financial burden that justified his rebellion is revealed as a misunderstanding, and he's clearly processing this.\n\n\"Five percent total,\" he murmurs, looking at the document. \"And compensation for levies. God, we were so wrong about—\"\n\nThen you say it: \"But your titles will pass on to your son and you will be a Count no more.\"\n\nDiego freezes. The document falls from his hands.\n\n\"What?\" His voice is barely a whisper.\n\n\"You will be stripped of your title,\" you continue, explaining the justice of it. \"Your son becomes Count. The family keeps all lands. You—\"\n\n\"NO.\"\n\nThe word erupts from him like a physical force. His face flushes deep red, veins standing out on his neck and forehead.\n\n\"You want me to give up my TITLE?\" His voice rises to a shout. \"To live in my own home—the home my fathers built, the lands my family has held for generations—as NOTHING? While my son rules over me? While I'm stripped of everything that makes me WHO I AM?\"\n\nBaron Alfonso tries to speak: \"Diego, you keep the lands, your family is safe—\"\n\n\"SHUT UP, COUSIN!\" Diego whirls on him. \"You bent your knee and they let you keep your title! But me? Oh no, I have to be HUMILIATED! Made an example of! The rebel Count who gets to live as a ghost in his own castle while everyone whispers about how he was stripped of his honor!\"\n\nHe turns back to you, and his face is a mask of fury. \"This isn't justice, Your Majesty! This is calculated humiliation! You dress it up with fair words about the tax—oh yes, the tax is reasonable, how generous!—but then you strip away the one thing that actually MATTERS!\"\n\nHis brother Luis steps forward desperately: \"Diego, please, think about what you're—\"\n\n\"I HAVE thought about it!\" Diego's voice breaks with rage. \"I've thought about living under my own roof while my son sits in my chair! About being introduced as 'the former Count'! About watching my title—my IDENTITY—belong to someone else while I'm still breathing! You think that's mercy? That's WORSE than death!\"\n\nHe's breathing hard, fists clenched, trembling with fury. \"You know what, Your Majesty? I was starting to believe you. I thought—maybe he's different. Maybe he actually cares about justice. But this?\" He gestures violently. \"This is just revenge dressed up in pretty words. You want me to choose between dying with my title or living without it. Well at least if I die on my walls, I die as COUNT DIEGO DE GUZMÁN, not some pathetic stripped nothing begging my own son for permission to sit at dinner!\"\n\nBaron Alfonso tries again: \"Diego, for God's sake, it's just a title—\"\n\n\"JUST A TITLE?\" Diego's voice cracks. \"It's everything! It's who I am! It's who my father was, and his father! The Guzmán name, the Count of Niebla—that's not just words on paper, that's my LIFE! And he wants me to hand it over and smile and say 'thank you for the mercy' while I become nothing!\"\n\nTears of rage are streaming down his face now. \"No. NO! I won't do it! I won't stand there at my own son's investiture and watch him become what I was! I won't live as a ghost! I won't—\"\n\nHe stops himself, breathing in ragged gasps. When he speaks again, his voice is quiet but absolute:\n\n\"Keep your mercy, Your Majesty. Keep your fair taxes and your generous terms. I'd rather die Count Diego de Guzmán on my walls than live as nobody in my own home.\"\n\nHe turns sharply to his men. \"We're done here. Back to the fortress.

He can flatten my walls! But he'll do it to COUNT DIEGO, not to some stripped nothing begging for scraps!\"\n\nHe's walking backward toward the fortress now, still facing you, his face a mask of rage and wounded pride. \"You came here thinking you'd do what you did at Sanlúcar! Break me with reason! But there's no reason that makes losing my title acceptable! There's no mercy in living as nothing!\"\n\nBaron Alfonso calls out desperately: \"Diego! For the love of God, you're throwing your life away over a title—\"\n\n\"IT'S NOT JUST A TITLE!\" Diego screams back. \"It's EVERYTHING! And you'll never understand because you got to KEEP YOURS!\"\n\nHe's thirty yards away now, still backing toward his fortress, his guards around him looking uncertain but following their lord. Luis is standing between the two parties, clearly torn, looking back and forth between his brother and you.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Your Majesty,\" Diego calls out, his voice raw. \"I'm sorry the tax was misunderstood. I'm sorry about yesterday's shooting. I'm sorry about a lot of things.\" His voice breaks. \"But I'm not sorry enough to stop being who I am. Bring your army. Do what you must. But I'll die Count Diego de Guzmán, and that's worth more to me than any mercy that strips me of my name.\"\n\nHe turns and walks quickly back toward the fortress, his men following. Luis stands frozen for a moment, then runs after his brother: \"Diego, wait! Just wait!\"\n\nBut Diego doesn't stop. Within moments he and his party have crossed back to the fortress side of the field. The gates open to receive them.\n\nBaron Alfonso stands beside you, staring in disbelief. \"He's... he's actually choosing death over losing his title. I can't... I thought...\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava's face is grim. \"Some men cannot be saved from themselves, Baron. You were wise enough to see reason. The Count is not.\"\n\nThe fortress gates close with a heavy thud that echoes across the field. The parley is over. The siege will proceed.\n\nThe morning sun continues rising over Niebla. The white truce banner still flutters in the field, but both parties have withdrawn. Your offers of mercy—fair, just, reasonable—have been rejected over wounded pride and the inability to live without a title.\n\nThe Infante Juan speaks quietly: \"Your Majesty offered him everything. His life, his lands, his family's position. Everything except the one thing his pride couldn't surrender.\"\n\nYou stand in the field between the siege lines and the fortress, the failed parley behind you. In a few days, the main army will arrive with five bombards. And then Niebla will be reduced by force, because Count Diego de Guzmán chose his title over his life.\n\nWhat do you do?"

The Master of Calatrava and the forces present will work to complete the siege lines and prepare for the bombardment once the artillery arrives.\n\nKey timeline:\n- Current date: March 12, 1432 (morning, failed parley)\n- Main army with bombards: Redirected from Seville road on March 9, should arrive March 13-14\n- Current forces: 2,500 under Master of Calatrava + Juan's 200 vanguard = 2,700 total\n- Incoming: ~5,000 more troops + 5 bombards\n\nI should show the professional military response to Juan's order, the completion of siege preparations, and probably advance time to when the bombards arrive so the actual siege can begin.\n\nYour words cut through the morning air with finality. The Master of Calatrava straightens, his face hardening into professional resolve.\n\n\"As Your Majesty commands.\" He turns to his knights. \"Return to camp. Full siege protocols. Complete the encirclement—no one enters or leaves that fortress. Trenches finished by nightfall. Prepare positions for the bombards when they arrive.\"\n\nBaron Alfonso looks shaken, staring at the closed gates of his cousin's fortress. \"He chose this. God help me, I tried, but he chose this.\"\n\nThe Infante Juan's voice is cold. \"He had every chance. More than most rebels ever receive. He threw it away.\"\n\nSIEGE PREPARATIONS - MARCH 12-13, 1432\n\nThe camp transforms into a war machine. The Master of Calatrava's Military Order knights and your vanguard work with disciplined efficiency.\n\nMarch 12 (Afternoon):\n\nSiege lines completed encircling the entire town and fortress\n\nTrenches dug at 300 yards from walls—safe from effective crossbow fire\n\nSupply depot fortified, field hospital established\n\nSentries posted on all approaches—complete blockade\n\nScouts sent to meet the incoming main army, guide them to positions\n\nInside the Fortress:\nYou can see movement on the walls. Count Diego's banners still fly. Defenders are visible, preparing for what they know is coming. The town below the fortress shows less activity—townspeople trapped between their lord's pride and the king's army.\n\nMarch 13 (Morning):\nThe main army arrives.\n\nDon Rodrigo Manrique rides at the head of nearly 5,000 troops—the force that was originally marching toward Sanlúcar, now redirected here. Behind them, the siege train rumbles into view: the five massive bombards on their wheeled carriages, wagons of powder and stone shot, engineers and artillery crews.\n\nDon Rodrigo dismounts and bows. \"Your Majesty. We came as quickly as we could after receiving the redirect order. When we heard what happened at Sanlúcar...\" He looks toward Niebla's fortress. \"But here, no miracle?\"\n\n\"Here, there will be bombardment,\" you reply simply.\n\nDon Rodrigo nods grimly. \"Then we'll prepare the guns.\"\n\nSIEGE DEPLOYMENT - MARCH 13, 1432\n\nTotal Forces:\n\n7,500+ troops fully assembled\n\nFive bombards with full ammunition\n\nComplete encirclement of fortress and town\n\nSupply lines from Seville secure\n\nArtillery Positioning:\nThe Master of Calatrava and Don Rodrigo consult with the artillery engineers, studying the fortress walls.\n\n\"The northeastern wall—where the fortress joins the town defenses—that's the weakest point,\" the chief engineer reports. \"Roman foundations but medieval construction on top. The bombards can concentrate fire there. Three to five days of bombardment should create a practical breach.\"\n\nFive massive gun positions are prepared at 200 yards from the northeast wall—close enough for accuracy, far enough to be relatively safe from counter-fire (the fortress has some artillery but nothing matching your bombards). Earth berms are piled to protect the gun crews. Powder magazines are positioned safely behind the lines.\n\nFortress Assessment:\n\nMain keep: Strong but bombardable\n\nWalls: Good condition but not exceptional\n\nGarrison: ~200 men (adequate for garrison, insufficient for prolonged siege)\n\nSupplies: Unknown, but probably adequate for weeks\n\nMorale: Unknown—Count's dramatic rejection may inspire some, horrify others\n\nThe Complication:\nThe town of Niebla (1,500 inhabitants) is trapped inside with the fortress. They're not combatants, but they're caught in the Count's rebellion. Your bombardment will strike the fortress walls, but the town huddles nearby.\n\nDon Rodrigo raises this issue carefully: \"Your Majesty, we could send heralds offering the townspeople safe passage before bombardment begins. Give them chance to leave before we open fire.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava adds: \"Or we proceed immediately. Count Diego made his choice. Those who stay with him share his fate.\"\n\nBaron Alfonso speaks quietly: \"Some of those people are my cousins' subjects. Good Castilians trapped by their lord's pride. If we could spare them...\"\n\nMARCH 13, 1432 - EVENING\n\nThe siege is set. Five bombards aimed at the northeastern wall. Seven thousand troops in position. Supply lines established. The fortress sits silent and defiant, banners still flying.\n\nTomorrow morning, the bombardment can begin.\n\nDon Rodrigo approaches your command tent as dusk falls. \"Your Majesty, all is ready. The guns are positioned and loaded. We can open fire at dawn, or we can send final heralds tonight—offer terms one last time, or offer the townspeople evacuation.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"Or we simply begin the bombardment at first light and reduce the fortress systematically. Your orders?\"\n\nThe evening is quiet except for camp sounds—men preparing equipment, horses being tended, sentries calling passwords. Across the field, perhaps 400 yards away, Niebla's fortress stands in gathering darkness. Torches flicker on its walls. Somewhere inside, Count Diego de Guzmán prepares for the bombardment he chose over surrendering his title.\n\nWhat do you decide?"

The final breach on day 4\n6. Setting up for Juan to decide what to do next - assault, offer terms, etc.\n\nI need to be careful to respect Juan's agency - I should stop before he makes decisions about the assault or any further actions.\n\nTHE BOMBARDMENT OF NIEBLA\n\nMarch 14-17, 1432\n\nDAY ONE - MARCH 14, 1432\n\nDawn breaks cold and clear. Perfect conditions for artillery work—no wind to affect aim, good visibility.\n\nThe five bombards are positioned in a gentle arc, all aimed at the same 50-yard section of the northeastern wall where the fortress joins the town's Roman-era defenses. The artillery master—a grizzled veteran who served at Constantinople years ago—has calculated the angles precisely.\n\n\"Load!\" The command echoes across the siege lines.\n\nCrews work in coordinated teams. Each bombard requires a dozen men—loading the massive stone shot (each weighing 200-300 pounds), measuring powder carefully, ramming wadding, checking touchholes. The process takes nearly thirty minutes per shot.\n\nAt the signal, you watch from a command position 300 yards back. The artillery master raises his hand, checks the guns one final time, then drops it.\n\n\"FIRE!\"\n\nThe first bombard roars. The sound is monstrous—a deep, earth-shaking boom that rolls across the valley. A gout of flame and smoke erupts from the barrel. The massive stone ball arcs through the morning air, clearly visible, and strikes the target wall section with a thunderous CRACK.\n\nStone chips fly. A visible divot appears in the masonry. Dust billows up.\n\nBefore the echoes fade, the second gun fires. Then the third. Fourth. Fifth. Within two minutes, all five shots have struck the wall in roughly the same area—a 30-yard stretch of medieval stonework on Roman foundation.\n\nThe dust clears. Five impact points mar the wall—none have breached it yet, but the damage is clearly visible even from your position. Cracks spider web from the impact sites.\n\n\"Excellent shooting!\" Don Rodrigo observes. \"The crews are well-coordinated, and the target section is responding as expected. The mortar there is medieval quality, not Roman concrete. It will crumble.\"\n\nThe loading process begins again. Thirty minutes later, the second volley thunders out. More impacts, more cracks spreading. By noon, after four volleys (twenty shots total), the wall section is visibly damaged—mortar crumbling, stones loosening, cracks connecting.\n\nInside the fortress, you can see defenders scrambling. They bring timber and sandbags, attempting to shore up the damaged section from behind. Some return crossbow fire toward the gun positions, but at 200 yards the bolts fall short or strike the protective berms harmlessly.\n\nBy evening of the first day, after ten volleys (fifty shots), the wall section shows serious structural damage. No breach yet, but the stonework is clearly failing. Cracks run vertically through three stones, mortar has fallen away in several places, and the wall face is pockmarked with impact craters.\n\nThe defenders work frantically through the night—you can see torches on the walls as they try to repair the damage, pile rubble behind weak points, prepare for tomorrow.\n\nDAY TWO - MARCH 15, 1432\n\nDawn brings renewed bombardment. The guns have cooled overnight, cleaned and prepared. Fresh powder and shot are ready.\n\nThe artillery master has analyzed yesterday's results. \"Your Majesty, three stones in the center of the target area are severely compromised. If we concentrate fire there today, we should see significant collapse.\"\n\nThe second day's bombardment is devastating.\n\nThe first volley of the morning strikes the already-weakened section. On the third shot, a massive stone block—perhaps weighing a ton—simply falls away from the wall. It tumbles down the exterior face, leaving a gap. Not yet a practical breach, but the first real penetration.\n\nDefenders scramble to the gap, trying to fill it with timber and sandbags. But they're working under fire. The fourth shot of the morning volley strikes near the gap, and two more stones collapse. Suddenly there's a hole eight feet wide and six feet high—small, but definitely through the wall.\n\nThe bombardment continues relentlessly. Volley after volley. By mid-afternoon, the gap has widened to fifteen feet across. Rubble is piling up both inside and outside the wall—creating the beginning of a rough ramp. Defenders can no longer work on repairs—anyone approaching the breach area is in direct line of fire.\n\nBy evening, after another full day of bombardment (forty more shots, ninety total), the breach is twenty feet wide and twelve feet high. Rubble has created a slope on both sides. It's not quite assault-ready—still too narrow for mass troop movement, too much loose rubble—but it's clearly becoming a practical breach.\n\nInside the fortress, you can see the impact. Defenders are pulling back from the breach area. The Count's banners still fly, but there's visible confusion and fear on the walls.\n\nDAY THREE - MARCH 16, 1432\n\nThe third day of bombardment is when the wall truly breaks.\n\nThe breach from yesterday provides a weak point that the guns exploit mercilessly. The artillery master concentrates fire on the stones immediately adjacent to the existing gap—undermining them, causing progressive collapse.\n\nMid-morning, a spectacular event: an entire section of wall—perhaps thirty feet wide—collapses at once. The supporting stones finally fail under accumulated damage, and the whole structure slides down in a rumbling avalanche of masonry, timber, and dust. The crash is audible across the entire siege camp.\n\nWhen the dust clears, a major breach is visible. Forty feet wide, twenty feet at the highest point, sloping down to rubble ramps on both sides. Completely passable. A mounted knight could ride through it.\n\nThe defenders have abandoned any attempt to repair. They're pulling back to secondary positions—the inner keep, prepared barricades. They know the breach is indefensible.\n\nThe bombardment continues throughout the day, but now it's about widening and improving the breach rather than creating it. By evening, after three full days and 130 total shots, the breach is fifty feet wide with relatively gentle rubble ramps on both sides. Assault troops could advance through it in formation.\n\nDAY FOUR - MARCH 17, 1432 (Morning)\n\nThe fourth day brings refinement rather than creation. The artillery master shifts fire to smooth the approach—knocking down any protruding stones that might impede assault, clearing rubble that blocks the ramps.\n\nBy mid-morning, the work is essentially complete. The breach is wide, accessible, and practical. The northeastern wall section that four days ago was solid medieval masonry is now a gaping wound in the fortress's defenses—rubble spilling out both sides, smoke-stained stones, a clear route into the fortress interior.\n\nDon Rodrigo and the Master of Calatrava inspect the breach from a forward position.\n\n\"It's excellent work,\" Don Rodrigo reports. \"We can assault through that breach with minimal casualties. The approach is clear, the width allows formation movement, the rubble ramps are stable enough for armored troops.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava adds: \"The defenders have pulled back to the inner keep and what looks like barricaded streets. They're preparing for fighting inside the fortress. Count Diego's banner still flies, but...\" He gestures toward the walls. \"Look at the walls. Fewer defenders visible. Morale must be breaking.\"\n\nIndeed, the walls that four days ago were lined with crossbowmen now show only scattered sentries. The bombardment's psychological impact is as devastating as its physical destruction.\n\nSITUATION - MARCH 17, 1432 (Noon)\n\nThe Breach:\n\n50+ feet wide\n\nAccessible rubble ramps both sides\n\nWide enough for formation assault\n\nMinimal obstructions\n\nReady for immediate assault\n\nFortress Status:\n\nNortheastern wall section destroyed\n\nDefenders pulled back to inner keep and secondary positions\n\nGarrison still intact (~200 men) but demoralized\n\nCount Diego still commanding (banner flying)\n\nNo white flags, no surrender offers\n\nTown population trapped inside, terrified\n\nYour Forces:\n\n7,500 troops fresh and ready\n\nAssault can be launched whenever ordered\n\nArtillery can provide covering fire during assault\n\nMedical facilities prepared for casualties\n\nOptions Available:\n\nImmediate Assault: Order troops through the breach now. Overwhelm defenders with numbers. High chance of success but will result in street fighting, casualties on both sides, potential civilian deaths in town.\n\nOffer Terms: Send herald one more time. Breach is made, resistance clearly futile. Offer garrison chance to surrender before assault. May save lives, but Count already rejected terms once.\n\nBombardment of Keep: Shift guns to target the inner keep where Count Diego has retreated. Could force surrender without assault, but risks more civilian casualties and property destruction.\n\nBlockade and Starve: Wait. The breach makes the fortress indefensible long-term. Starvation will force surrender eventually. Saves assault casualties but takes weeks/months.\n\nDon Rodrigo, the Master of Calatrava, Infante Juan, and Baron Alfonso stand with you, looking at the breach and the battered fortress beyond. The bombardment has stopped—the guns sit silent, crews resting, waiting for orders.\n\nThe fortress remains silent. No white flags. No envoys. Just the Count's banner still flying defiantly over the damaged walls.\n\nWhat do you do?"

I should have his commanders provide realistic military assessments.\n\nKey points to cover:\n1. Can they take the breach easily? (Yes, likely)\n2. Can they take the keep in the same assault? (More complicated)\n3. Casualties expected\n4. Street fighting complications\n5. Civilian casualties risk\n6. Alternative of offering terms one more time\n7. Timeline considerations\n\nThis should be a military planning discussion, not me deciding for Juan. I present the options and let him choose.\n\nDon Rodrigo studies the fortress carefully, then turns to address you along with the Master of Calatrava and several senior captains who've gathered for the tactical discussion.\n\n\"Your Majesty, let me break this into phases,\" Don Rodrigo begins, pointing toward the breach and fortress beyond.\n\nPHASE ONE: THE BREACH ASSAULT\n\n\"Taking the breach itself?\" Don Rodrigo is confident. \"That's nearly certain. We have overwhelming numbers—7,500 against perhaps 200 defenders. The breach is excellent. We send 2,000 troops in the first wave with ladder teams for any remaining wall sections. They'll sweep through that breach in under an hour.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava nods agreement. \"The breach assault will succeed. No question. Expected casualties for taking the breach and securing the wall section: perhaps 50-100 of our men, maybe 50 defenders killed or wounded. The rest will fall back to secondary positions.\"\n\n\"So Phase One is straightforward,\" Don Rodrigo continues. \"But Phase Two is where it gets complicated.\"\n\nPHASE TWO: STREET FIGHTING AND THE KEEP\n\nCaptain Alonso de Cárdenas, who has siege experience, steps forward with a sketch of the fortress layout.\n\n\"Your Majesty, once we're through the breach, we enter the town and fortress complex. The Count has had four days to prepare internal defenses. We'll face:\"\n\n1. Barricaded Streets\n\"They'll have blocked the main approaches with wagons, timber, rubble. We'll need to clear these under crossbow fire from windows and rooftops. Slow, bloody work.\"\n\n2. House-to-House Fighting\n\"The town has 1,500 inhabitants in perhaps 300 buildings packed tight together. Defenders can retreat from house to house, ambush from doorways, shoot from upper windows. Every building becomes a small fortress.\"\n\n3. The Inner Keep\n\"The keep itself is perhaps 40 yards square, four stories, thick walls. Once we clear the town, we still need to take it. They'll barricade the entrance, defend from arrow slits. It's designed to be the last redoubt.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava adds: \"And Your Majesty, there's the matter of the townspeople. 1,500 civilians trapped in there. During street fighting, they'll be cowering in their homes. Some will be caught in crossfire. Some buildings will catch fire—it's almost inevitable with fighting in close quarters. We could see 50-200 civilian deaths even if we're careful.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo lays it out bluntly: \"Can we take everything in one assault, today? Yes, probably. We have the numbers and the breach. But the cost...\"\n\nHe pauses, calculating. \"Expected casualties for the complete operation—breach, streets, keep:\n\nOur losses: 200-400 dead, 300-600 wounded\n\nDefender losses: 150-180 dead (nearly all of them)\n\nCivilian losses: 50-200 dead, more wounded\n\nTimeline: 6-8 hours of fighting, possibly into the night\n\nTown damage: Significant fires, destroyed buildings\"\n\nTHE KEEP SPECIFICALLY\n\nInfante Juan, who has been studying the keep through the breach, speaks up: \"The keep is the hardest part. Even after we clear the town, if Count Diego retreats there with 50-100 loyal men, they could hold for hours or even days. We'd need to either starve them out or storm it—and storming a defended keep with a barricaded entrance is costly.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo nods. \"We could bring the bombards to bear on the keep's entrance, blast it open. That would work but takes another day of bombardment. Or we storm it with ladders and rams, which is brave but bloody.\"\n\nALTERNATIVE APPROACHES\n\nBaron Alfonso speaks quietly: \"Your Majesty, there is another option. We've made the breach. The fortress is clearly indefensible. We could send one more herald—offer the garrison and townspeople terms before the assault. Not to the Count necessarily, but to the garrison itself and the town.\"\n\nHe continues: \"Tell them: Surrender now, garrison gets to leave with weapons and personal possessions, townspeople are unharmed, only Count Diego faces judgment. The garrison might force the Count's hand, or simply open the gates over his objections. These are Castilian soldiers. They can see their position is hopeless.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava considers this. \"It could work. The garrison's morale must be broken after watching that bombardment. If they know surrender means life while resistance means death... some might choose life.\"\n\nDon Rodrigo adds: \"But there's risk. If we offer terms and they refuse again, it might embolden them. 'The king is weak, he's afraid to assault.' Though honestly, after that breach, I don't think anyone in there believes we're afraid.\"\n\nTIMELINE CONSIDERATIONS\n\n\"If we assault today,\" Don Rodrigo summarizes, \"we could have the entire fortress by nightfall. Costly, but done. Then we move on to Granada within days.\"\n\n\"If we offer terms first—send a herald this afternoon, give them until tomorrow morning to respond—we might get surrender without assault. Saves our men, saves civilians, ends it cleanly. But if they refuse, we assault tomorrow instead of today. One day delay.\"\n\n\"If we just bombard the keep into submission, that's 2-3 more days of artillery work, then they'll likely surrender. Less risky for our troops but more civilian casualties from bombardment and more time.\"\n\nTHE COMMANDERS' ASSESSMENT\n\nDon Rodrigo looks at you directly: \"Your Majesty, my professional recommendation? Send one more herald. Offer the garrison and town terms—everyone except the Count walks away free. Give them two hours to respond. If they refuse, we assault at sunset today and finish it by midnight. This gives us the chance to avoid unnecessary bloodshed while maintaining the threat of immediate assault.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava: \"I concur. The breach is made. Our dominance is proven. One more offer of mercy costs us nothing but two hours. If they refuse, we have plenty of daylight left for the assault.\"\n\nInfante Juan: \"Brother, the troops are ready now. We could go immediately. But...\" He pauses. \"After what you achieved at Sanlúcar, after the mercy you offered Count Diego this morning—offering the garrison one more chance to choose life over the Count's pride? That's consistent with your approach.\"\n\nBaron Alfonso: \"My cousin is mad with pride. But his men aren't all mad. Give them the choice. Some will take it.\"\n\nThe afternoon sun is high. It's perhaps 1 PM. You have several hours of good daylight remaining if you choose immediate assault. Or you could send a herald now, get a response by 3 PM, and still have time to assault before dark if they refuse.\n\nWhat do you decide?"

Then the herald repeats it twice more, ensuring everyone inside can hear clearly.

This is a very positive result - the garrison is mutinying against Count Diego, officers are defecting, the fortress is essentially surrendering except for a small core of absolute loyalists around the Count.\n\nLet me draft this carefully, showing:\n1. The initial response from inside the fortress\n2. The herald's interaction with the defecting officers\n3. The mass evacuation \n4. Count Diego's reaction and confinement\n5. The situation when the dust settles\n6. What this means for the assault plan\n\nThis should be dramatic and show the complete breakdown of the Count's authority when faced with the king's mercy offer.\n\nTHE MUTINY AT NIEBLA\n\nMarch 17, 1432 - Afternoon\n\nThe herald withdraws after delivering your proclamation. For perhaps twenty minutes, nothing happens. The fortress remains silent, the breach gaping open like a wound in its walls.\n\nThen sounds of shouting erupt from inside—muffled but clearly heated. Arguments. Multiple voices raised in anger.\n\nDon Rodrigo stands beside you, watching intently. \"Something's happening in there. That's not organized defense preparation—that's conflict.\"\n\nSuddenly, movement at the breach. Not defenders preparing to fight—people emerging. A trickle at first: a woman carrying a child, an old man with a walking stick, several townspeople in simple clothes. They climb carefully over the rubble ramps, hands raised, clearly terrified but moving toward your lines.\n\nYour forward sentries let them pass. Within minutes, the trickle becomes a stream. Dozens of townspeople evacuating—women, children, elderly, craftsmen. They pour through the breach and smaller gates that are opening along the walls.\n\n\"They're opening the gates,\" the Infante observes. \"All of them.\"\n\nBut it's not just civilians. Among the evacuating crowd, you see soldiers—garrison troops in mail and gambesons, carrying their weapons but clearly not in formation. Deserting. Ten soldiers. Twenty. Thirty. The stream of military personnel leaving grows.\n\nThen, perhaps thirty minutes after the herald's proclamation, formal movement at the main gate. It swings fully open, and a delegation emerges—three men in military dress, walking deliberately toward your lines under a white banner.\n\nDon Rodrigo recognizes them through distance: \"That's the castellan. And... I think that's the Count's brother. They're coming to parley.\"\n\nTHE OFFICERS' SURRENDER\n\nThe three men—old Rodrigo Fernández (castellan), Luis de Guzmán (the Count's younger brother), and a senior sergeant named Alonso—approach your command position and immediately drop to their knees.\n\nCastellan Rodrigo speaks, his voice shaking with emotion and exhaustion:\n\n\"Your Majesty, we come to surrender the fortress of Niebla on behalf of the garrison and townspeople.\" He looks up at you, weathered face lined with stress. \"Count Diego has lost his reason. When your herald offered safe passage, he ordered us to bar the gates and execute anyone attempting to leave. He was prepared to hold the entire town hostage to his pride.\"\n\nLuis de Guzmán—the younger brother who stood beside Diego at the failed parley—speaks next, voice thick with shame and anger: \"My brother has gone mad, Your Majesty. Completely mad. He was screaming about dying with his title, about taking everyone with him, about making the king pay in blood for every stone of Niebla.\" Tears stream down his face. \"I tried to talk to him. Rodrigo tried. The officers tried. He wouldn't listen. He was going to get everyone killed for nothing.\"\n\nThe castellan continues: \"So we made a decision, Your Majesty. The senior officers and I... we removed Count Diego from command. He's been confined to his chambers in the keep under guard. Not harmed—we're not traitors who murder their lords—but prevented from giving orders that would kill us all.\"\n\nHe gestures back toward the fortress. \"The gates are open. The townspeople are evacuating as fast as they can move. The garrison is standing down—most have already left, seeking your promised safe passage. Perhaps forty men remain—Count Diego's household knights, absolute loyalists who won't leave him even now. They hold the keep with him.\"\n\nLuis adds desperately: \"We're not rebels against you, Your Majesty. We never were. We were following our lord's orders, as our oaths required. But when he became mad—when he was going to sacrifice innocents for his wounded pride—we had to act. Please, the townspeople are blameless. The garrison soldiers were just following orders. Your quarrel is with my brother alone.\"\n\nThe sergeant Alonso speaks for the first time: \"Your Majesty, I've served Count Diego for fifteen years. Good man, normally. But something broke in him when you offered those terms this morning. The title thing... it destroyed something in his mind. He's not the man I knew. Please, show mercy to those of us who did our duty but drew the line at madness.\"\n\nTHE EVACUATION\n\nOver the next two hours, Niebla empties.\n\nThe townspeople flood out in a steady stream—entire families with whatever possessions they can carry. Your troops establish collection points, provide water, direct them to safe areas behind the siege lines. They're terrified but grateful, many weeping with relief.\n\n\"Thank you, Your Majesty,\" one old woman says as she passes. \"Thank you for giving us the choice. The Count would have kept us there to die.\"\n\nThe garrison evacuation is more organized but no less dramatic. Soldiers emerge in small groups, laying down their weapons at designated points, giving their names to scribes. They're not prisoners—you offered safe passage and you honor it—but they're clearly expecting punishment anyway.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, the count is staggering:\n\n1,400+ townspeople evacuated (over 90% of the population)\n\n140-150 garrison soldiers evacuated (75% of the original ~200 garrison)\n\nThe fortress town is essentially empty\n\nOnly the inner keep remains occupied. Count Diego's banner still flies from its highest tower. Perhaps 40-50 men remain with him—his household knights, personal retainers, the absolute loyalists who won't abandon their lord even in madness.\n\nTHE SITUATION - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nDon Rodrigo surveys the scene with something approaching awe. \"Your Majesty, I've been at a dozen sieges. I've never seen anything like this. A fortress that surrendered itself because the commander went mad.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava adds: \"The town is ours without a fight. The only resistance remaining is the keep—perhaps forty men, barricaded inside with their mad Count.\"\n\nCastellan Rodrigo, still kneeling before you, speaks: \"Your Majesty, the keep is well-stocked. Diego could hold for weeks if he chooses. But he has no reason to hope now. No garrison, no townspeople, no support. Just his household knights and his wounded pride.\" He pauses. \"If you bring your bombard up and threaten the keep... he might still surrender. Or his knights might finally force the issue.\"\n\nLuis de Guzmán pleads: \"Please, Your Majesty. My brother is sick in his mind. I don't know if he can be saved, but... if there's any mercy possible...\" He can't finish, overcome with emotion.\n\nYOUR OPTIONS NOW\n\nThe situation has transformed completely:\n\nThe Keep:\n\nOnly structure still held by Count Diego\n\n~40-50 household knights loyal to him\n\nWell-supplied, could hold for weeks\n\nCompletely isolated, no hope of relief\n\nCount Diego presumably still in command (though confined to prevent his worst orders)\n\nAssault Options:\n\nBombard the Keep: Move one of the big guns into the town, blast the keep's entrance. Will work but takes 1-2 days of bombardment, risks killing the loyalists and possibly the Count.\n\nAssault the Keep Directly: Storm it with troops. Costly—the keep is designed for last-stand defense. Expect 50-100 casualties taking it by force.\n\nOffer Final Terms: Send herald to the keep specifically. Tell the household knights: \"Surrender the Count and walk away free.\" They might take it rather than die for a madman.\n\nBlockade and Wait: Simply surround the keep, cut off food/water. They'll surrender in days/weeks without bloodshed. But takes time you wanted to avoid.\n\nThe bombard is already being prepared for movement into the town as you ordered earlier. It could be in position by evening. The assault troops are ready. The evacuated civilians and soldiers are secured behind your lines.\n\nThe fortress of Niebla is yours—except for one stone keep holding a mad Count and his loyal knights.\n\nWhat do you do?"

This is smart - the Count is clearly unstable and his loyalists might fight to the death or the Count might do something desperate.\n\nLet me describe the preparation and positioning of the bombard, then we'll need to roll for what happens when they actually blast the gate and attempt to take the keep. This should be a chaos roll since we don't know how the Count and his remaining loyalists will react - could range from immediate surrender to desperate last stand to the Count doing something crazy like trying to burn the keep down with everyone in it.\n\nFirst, let me describe the movement of the bombard and the preparation, then set up the d100 table for what happens during the final assault.\n\nMOVING THE BOMBARD - MARCH 17, 1432 (Late Afternoon)\n\nDon Rodrigo immediately begins coordinating. \"Get the smallest bombard—the one mounted on the reinforced carriage. We need to move it through the breach and position it in the town square facing the keep.\"\n\nThe artillery master selects the gun—still a massive weapon, but the most mobile of the five. A team of oxen is harnessed, engineers check the carriage wheels, and powder and shot are loaded onto accompanying wagons.\n\n\"Clear a path through the breach!\" Orders ring out. Work crews scramble to smooth the rubble ramps, remove loose stones, widen the passage. Within an hour, the path is ready.\n\nThe bombard begins its slow journey. The oxen strain, the massive gun creeping forward at walking pace. Through the breach, across the rubble, into the abandoned streets of Niebla. The town is eerily empty—doors hanging open, possessions scattered where people dropped them in their rush to evacuate. Only your soldiers move through the streets now, securing positions.\n\nThe gun is positioned in the main square, perhaps 80 yards from the keep's entrance. The engineers calculate angles, build a firing platform from rubble and timber, construct protective barriers for the crew.\n\nMeanwhile, the assault force assembles. The Master of Calatrava selects 500 of his best troops:\n\n200 heavily armored knights\n\n200 infantry with shields and swords for close fighting\n\n100 crossbowmen for covering fire\n\nThey take positions in buildings surrounding the keep, in alleyways, behind walls—close enough to rush forward once the gate is breached, protected from any fire from the keep's arrow slits.\n\nTHE KEEP\n\nYou observe it from a covered position. A rectangular stone structure, perhaps 40 yards square, four stories high with a crenellated roof. Thick walls. The entrance is a heavy wooden gate reinforced with iron, set in a stone archway. Arrow slits on every level. Count Diego's banner still flies from the highest tower—defiant even now.\n\nThe keep has gone silent. No sounds from within. No movement visible at the arrow slits. Just stone and silence.\n\n\"They know we're here,\" Don Rodrigo observes. \"They can hear the gun being positioned. They're deciding what to do.\"\n\nInfante Juan adds grimly: \"Forty men in a stone box with a madman who chose death over surrender. This could go very badly.\"\n\nTHE BOMBARDMENT - EVENING\n\nThe gun is ready as the sun begins to lower. The artillery master checks everything twice—angle, powder load, shot positioned. The crew takes their stations. Your assault force crouches ready in their positions.\n\n\"Your Majesty, we can open fire on your order,\" Don Rodrigo reports. \"Three to five shots should breach that gate. Then we send in the assault troops. The keep's interior is tight quarters—narrow staircases, small rooms. It'll be brutal close fighting if they resist.\"\n\nThe Master of Calatrava adds: \"We should offer one final chance. Send a herald to that gate, call for surrender. Tell them: 'Come out now and live, or die when the bombardment begins.' Give them the choice.\"\n\nBaron Alfonso, who has been standing silently, speaks: \"My cousin is in there. Mad or not, he's still a Guzmán. And those knights with him—they're loyal men following their oaths, even to a madman. If there's any way to save them...\"\n\nThe keep remains silent and defiant. The bombard sits loaded and ready. Your assault troops wait for the order.\n\nWhat do you do?"
