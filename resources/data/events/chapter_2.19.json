          "text": "**Current Situation (Chapter 2.19 beginning):**\n- Date: March 19, 1434 (or shortly after)\n- Location: Rome\n- Juan is with Queen Lucia (pregnant, ~3 months with their first child together)\n- They have Princess Catalina (age 2)\n- 591 crusader knights are with them\n- They arrived after the Mistral disaster (lost 75 souls)\n\n**Recent Events from Chapter 2.18:**\n- Failed intelligence gathering:\n  - Lucia's inquiry to the Camera (rolled 24 - Polite Evasion)\n  - Fray Hernando's visit to Cardinal Orsini (rolled 17 - Polite but Distant)\n- Juan decided to march 591 knights to St. Peter's for Mass\n- Confession with Fray Hernando questioning Juan's patterns\n- Met Brother Tomás de Torquemada (Dominican who wants to attach to Juan)\n- Papal audience summons expected March 22\n\n**What they need:**\n- Intelligence on Eugenius IV's position\n- Understanding of Vatican politics before the papal audience\n- Who might be approachable\n\n**Available contacts in Rome that we know of:**\n1. Cardinal Orsini - but he was distant (rolled 17)\n2. Cardinal Capranica - appeared at Mass, caught Juan's eye, murmured Pope is watching\n3. Brother Torquemada - approached Juan, seems to want to attach himself to Juan's power\n4. Medici connections - Lucia mentioned asking Medici agent who might be approachable\n\nThe user says \"I am with Lucia and think about who to approach.\"\n\nLet me set the scene - they're in their chambers at Palazzo di San Marco, discussing strategy. I should describe the setting and Lucia's state, then stop and wait for Juan to act.\n\nMarch 19, 1434\nPalazzo di San Marco, Rome\nLate Afternoon\n\nThe blood orange rinds lie curled on the table between you, their bitter-sweet scent filling the small chamber. Through the narrow window, Rome's afternoon light stretches long shadows across the floor. Catalina has been taken to the nursery by her nurse, exhausted from the morning's Mass and the excitement of the market.\n\nLucia sits across from you, one hand resting absently on her belly—the habit has already begun, though she's barely showing. The color has returned to her face after the oranges. She's been quiet since your account of Torquemada, processing.\n\n\"So.\" She taps one finger against the table. \"Cardinal Orsini treats Fray Hernando like a stranger. The Camera clerk spoke for thirty minutes and said nothing. The French are watching us. And a Dominican has offered to make himself useful in ways that should make us uncomfortable.\" Her grey-green eyes fix on you. \"What do we actually know before your audience with the Holy Father?\"\n\nThe question hangs in the air.\n\nYou know less than you'd like. Eugenius summoned you—that means something. Cardinal Capranica caught your eye at Mass, murmured that the Pope was watching. Someone in the Vatican waved back at Catalina. The French faction monitors your movements. But the substance—what Eugenius actually thinks about parallel legislation, about Basel, about the crusade termination problem—remains opaque.\n\n\"The Medici agent,\" Lucia says slowly, reading your silence. \"I could try a different approach. Ask not about Camera finances—clearly they won't speak of that—but about people. Who in the Vatican might actually receive us. Who owes the Medici money and might welcome a new friend.\" She pauses. \"Or there's Capranica. He made himself visible deliberately. That was not accident.\"\n\nShe counts on her fingers: \"Capranica. The Medici connection. The Dominican who wants something. Cardinal Orsini, if we can understand why he's suddenly cold.\" A fourth finger. \"Or we wait. The papal audience is in three days. Perhaps the information will come to us.\"\n\nThe afternoon light shifts. Somewhere below, you hear the distant sound of your crusaders in the courtyard—the clink of harness, a burst of laughter. 591 men waiting to march to Constantinople, and you still don't know what the Pope will say when you kneel before him."

          "text": "**The situation:**\n- Juan is in Rome with 591 crusader knights\n- Failed attempts: Lucia's Camera inquiry (roll 24 - polite evasion), Fray Hernando's Orsini visit (roll 17 - polite but distant)\n- Cardinal Capranica made eye contact at Mass, murmured the Pope was watching\n- The French faction is monitoring Juan\n- Brother Torquemada has approached (but he's a different kind of contact - seeking to attach himself)\n- The Medici have connections in Rome\n\n**Potential contacts:**\n1. Cardinal Capranica - he made himself visible deliberately at Mass\n2. Cardinal Orsini - but he's been cold/distant\n3. Medici banking connections - could identify who might be approachable\n4. Other cardinals or Vatican officials\n\n**What does Juan want?**\n- Intelligence on Eugenius's position\n- Understanding of the Vatican's stance on parallel legislation\n- Information about Basel dynamics from the papal perspective\n- Any insight before the audience\n\n**Success Factors:**\n- Juan has moral authority from Granada conquest\n- He's bringing 591 crusaders to Constantinople - this is real commitment\n- He completed the Reconquista - unprecedented achievement\n- He has the Como Declaration framework\n- Capranica already showed interest at Mass\n- The Medici have financial leverage in Rome\n\n**Failure Factors:**\n- The Vatican is deliberately keeping distance\n- French faction is actively monitoring/opposing\n- Orsini (who knew Juan before) is now cold - suggesting instructions from above\n- The Camera is guarding secrets\n- Juan is an unknown quantity in the current papal-conciliar crisis\n- Eugenius may want to assess Juan personally before anyone briefs him\n- Vatican politics are treacherous - people don't want to be seen aligning before the Pope's own position is clear\n \nI'll leverage the Medici's extensive network to find potential Vatican contacts. Their banking connections span across Europe, making them an ideal intermediary for navigating complex political landscapes. The goal is to identify approachable Vatican officials who might provide insights into the current political dynamics.\n\nThe strategy involves using the Medici's influence to open doors that have previously remained closed, potentially circumventing the official channels that have been unresponsive to Juan's previous attempts at contact.\n\nThe d100 roll will determine the quality and depth of intelligence gathered through these discreet inquiries, ranging from complete failure to unexpected breakthroughs. Each tier reveals progressively more nuanced information about the Vatican's current state and Eugenius's potential intentions.\n\nIf the French faction becomes aware of these probing inquiries, they might take defensive actions to block Juan's intelligence gathering. There's a risk that someone could report back to Eugenius about these subtle investigations, potentially compromising the entire approach.\n\nThe most intriguing possibility emerges at the highest levels of success: an unexpected ally might surface, potentially providing critical intelligence that fundamentally reshapes Juan's strategic approach. In an extraordinary turn of events, Eugenius himself could even send a covert back-channel message, offering unprecedented insight into the papal court's inner workings.\n\nLucia nods, a flicker of determination crossing her features. \"I'll try the Medici approach differently this time. Not asking about finances—asking about people. Cosimo's agent here deals with half the cardinals in Rome. He knows who owes money, who's ambitious, who might welcome a conversation with a king who has actual soldiers.\"\n\nShe rises, smoothing her gown. \"And Capranica. He showed himself at Mass for a reason. Perhaps I send word that we noticed, and we're grateful for his... attention.\"\n\nD100: Pre-Audience Intelligence Gathering\n\nThe Approach: Lucia works the Medici banking network to identify approachable Vatican figures, while also following up on Capranica's deliberate signal at Mass.\n\nSuccess Factors\n\nCapranica already made himself visible—he wants contact\n\nThe Medici have leverage throughout Rome (debts, favors, information)\n\nJuan's 591 crusaders represent real commitment to Constantinople—this matters to anyone who cares about the East\n\nLucia is politically astute and speaks Italian natively\n\nJuan completed the Reconquista—unprecedented moral authority\n\nFailure Factors\n\nThe Vatican is deliberately maintaining distance (Orsini's coldness suggests instructions)\n\nFrench faction actively monitoring Juan's movements\n\nEugenius may want to assess Juan personally before anyone briefs him\n\nVatican courtiers fear being seen to align before the Pope's position is clear\n\nCamera finances are troubled—makes everyone defensive\n\nThree days is very little time to penetrate Vatican caution\n\nThe Table\n\n1-10: Backfire\nThe Medici agent reports that Lucia's inquiries have been noticed—and not favorably. Someone interprets the questions as Juan trying to gather intelligence to use against the Holy Father. Word reaches French-aligned cardinals. When Juan enters his audience, Eugenius will have heard that the Castilian king was \"fishing\" before bothering to present himself properly. The Vatican's cold distance becomes colder. No useful intelligence gained; suspicion increased.\n\n11-25: Locked Doors\nEveryone is waiting. The Medici agent explains apologetically: no one in the Vatican will commit to anything before the Pope himself has spoken with Juan. Capranica does not respond to the overture—perhaps he's reconsidered, perhaps he's been warned off. Orsini remains unreachable. The message is clear: present yourself to the Holy Father first, then we'll see. Juan enters his audience blind, knowing only that Rome is watching and judging.\n\n26-40: Context Without Access\nThe Medici agent provides useful background but no direct contacts. Lucia learns: Eugenius is financially desperate (the Camera's evasiveness confirms this); the French faction has 8-10 cardinals who oppose any strengthening of papal-Castilian ties; Cardinal d'Allemand in Basel has allies here who report everything; the Pope is interested in Juan but deeply cautious about anyone who might become too powerful an ally. Capranica sends a brief, noncommittal acknowledgment—he's interested but won't move before the audience. Juan enters knowing the landscape but not the Pope's mind.\n\n41-55: Capranica's Caution\nCardinal Capranica agrees to a brief, private conversation—but insists on discretion. He meets Lucia (not Juan directly) in a church near the Pantheon, speaking for perhaps fifteen minutes. He confirms: the Pope watched the Mass procession from his window and was impressed by the crusaders' discipline; Eugenius genuinely cares about Constantinople; the parallel legislation concept has reached Rome through Basel correspondence and Eugenius has not rejected it outright. But Capranica won't say more—he's testing the waters, not committing. Juan enters his audience with fragments: the Pope is interested, not hostile, but the Vatican is divided and cautious.\n\n56-70: The Banker's Whisper\nThe Medici agent does better than expected. He identifies a Camera official—not senior, but informed—who owes the Medici bank a substantial sum and might appreciate a friendly word. This official, after careful approach, reveals: Eugenius is desperate for the Constantinople expedition to succeed because it would strengthen his position against Basel; the Pope fears Juan might be too aligned with the Council; the termination criteria question is something Eugenius has thought about and has opinions on; the French faction is pushing Eugenius to be suspicious of Castilian influence. Additionally, Capranica sends word that he looks forward to speaking with His Majesty after the audience—a signal of future access. Juan enters knowing key concerns and that doors may open afterward.\n\n71-85: Capranica's Gamble\nCapranica takes a calculated risk. He invites Juan himself—not just Lucia—to an evening conversation at his residence, carefully informal, \"two servants of the Church discussing how best to serve.\" Over wine, Capranica is remarkably frank: Eugenius needs Juan's expedition to succeed, but fears becoming dependent on a foreign king; the parallel legislation idea intrigues the Pope because it offers a face-saving path, but powerful cardinals oppose any compromise with Basel; the French faction has been whispering that Juan seeks to dominate the Church through military strength; Eugenius will test Juan's humility and his willingness to subordinate Castilian interests to papal authority. Capranica offers no promises but provides a map of the terrain. Juan enters his audience understanding what the Pope fears and what he hopes for.\n\n86-95: The Back Channel\nThrough a combination of Medici leverage and Capranica's intervention, Juan receives something unexpected: a private message from Cardinal Orsini explaining his earlier coldness. Orsini writes that he was instructed to maintain distance until the Pope assessed Juan personally—but he remains Juan's friend and wanted Juan to understand: Eugenius fears that accepting Juan's parallel legislation framework means admitting Basel has legitimate authority; the Pope needs a way to adopt reforms without appearing to yield to conciliar pressure; if Juan can offer that—reforms as papal initiative rather than conciliar victory—Eugenius will be receptive. Orsini will speak with Juan after the audience, openly. Juan enters knowing exactly what Eugenius needs to hear.\n\n96-100: Providence\nThe Pope sends his own signal. Through Capranica, through the Medici, through channels that seem almost impossibly coordinated, Juan receives word: Eugenius watched the Mass procession and wept. The sight of 591 crusaders in white, unarmed, carrying the cross to St. Peter's—this moved him profoundly. He has been praying about Juan's arrival. He wants to believe this is Providence answering his crisis. Before the formal audience, a papal secretary delivers a private note: \"His Holiness looks forward to speaking with a son of the Church who acts rather than merely speaks.\" The audience will not be a test. It will be a conversation between men who need each other. Juan enters knowing he has already won something essential: the Pope's hope.\n\nShall I roll, or do you have a d100 ready?"

          "text": "Lucia returns after dark, her face drawn with fatigue. She waves away the servant offering wine and sinks into the chair across from you, pulling off her gloves with deliberate care.\n\n\"Context,\" she says finally. \"Not access. But context.\"\n\nShe spent the afternoon with the Medici agent—a Florentine named Bardi who manages Cosimo's Roman interests. He received her graciously, served excellent wine, and spoke for two hours without ever quite answering a direct question. But Lucia knows how to listen to what isn't said.\n\n\"The Camera is in trouble. Real trouble.\" She ticks off points on her fingers. \"Bardi wouldn't say how bad, but the way he didn't say it told me enough. Eugenius has been Pope for three years and the treasury has bled the entire time. Milan's wars, the Colonna troubles, Basel draining his authority—and with it, his revenues. The annates reform decree? Bardi laughed when I mentioned it. Said if Basel's version passes, the Camera loses three-quarters of its income from benefices.\"\n\nShe pauses, gathering her thoughts.\n\n\"The French. Eight to ten cardinals here are aligned with Cardinal d'Allemand in Basel. They send reports. Everything you do, everything we do—it reaches Basel within a week. Bardi says they've been... interpreting your arrival. A foreign king with 600 soldiers, marching on St. Peter's.\" Her mouth twists. \"They're not calling it piety. They're calling it pressure.\"\n\nThe fire crackles. Outside, Rome's church bells mark the hour.\n\n\"And the Pope himself?\" She shrugs, frustrated. \"Interested. Cautious. Bardi says Eugenius genuinely cares about Constantinople—it's not political theater for him. But he's been burned before. He trusted the Council at first, sent Cesarini as his legate, and then they declared themselves superior to him. He trusted Sigismund's mediation, and Como gave him nothing but delay.\" She meets your eyes. \"He's a man who wants to believe but has learned that belief costs him.\"\n\nFinally, the question you most wanted answered:\n\n\"Parallel legislation. Bardi had heard of it—which means it's reached Rome through Basel correspondence. He said Eugenius hasn't rejected it outright.\" She holds up a hand before you can speak. \"But he hasn't accepted it either. Bardi's sense is that the Pope is waiting to see what kind of man proposes it. Whether you're offering him a ladder out of a hole, or digging the hole deeper.\"\n\nShe reaches into her sleeve and produces a small folded paper.\n\n\"Capranica. He received my message. Sent this back.\"\n\nThe note is brief, written in a secretary's careful hand:\n\nHis Eminence thanks the Queen of Castile for her gracious words and hopes that Providence will guide all servants of Christ toward understanding. He remains, as always, attentive to the needs of Holy Mother Church.\n\nLucia watches your face as you read it.\n\n\"He's interested. But he won't move before your audience.\" She sighs. \"No one will. The entire Vatican is waiting to see what Eugenius does with you before they decide what they think.\"\n\nShe leans back, exhaustion evident.\n\n\"So. You enter your audience knowing the Pope is desperate, suspicious, genuinely devout, and surrounded by people telling him to fear you. You know the French are whispering. You know the money is bad. You know parallel legislation hasn't been rejected.\" A tired smile. \"You don't know what he'll say when you kneel before him. But you know what he's afraid of.\"\n\nThe audience is in two days."

Everyone is waiting for the Pope to make his move first.\n\nWhat would Lucia's perspective be?\n\n1. She might point out that the Vatican's silence IS information - they're being told to wait\n2. She might counsel patience - trying too hard could backfire\n3. She might suggest focusing on preparing for the audience itself rather than trying to gather more intelligence\n4. She might note that Juan's strength is his directness, not his scheming\n\nLucia is Italian, she understands court politics intimately. She would recognize when further maneuvering is counterproductive.\n\nLet me write her response. She should be honest, perhaps a little sharp (that's her character), but supportive. She shouldn't just agree with whatever Juan says - she's his partner and advisor, not a yes-woman.\n\nI should also not generate dialogue or actions for Juan - just have Lucia respond and then stop, waiting for Juan's response.\n\nLucia is quiet for a long moment, studying you with those grey-green eyes.

Do you want to give them more to whisper about?\"\n\nHer expression softens.\n\n\"You completed the Reconquista. You brought 591 knights to fight for Constantinople. You carry letters from the Emperor. You have earned this audience.\" She crosses back to you, stands close. \"You don't need to scheme your way into the Pope's favor.

That God's timing is not ours to force?\"\n\nA pause. The fire crackles.\n\n\"Rest. Pray. Prepare what you will say.

The Tiber flows dark and slow to your left, carrying barges toward the sea.\n\nThe air changes as Rome falls behind. Cooler. Cleaner. Salt on the wind.\n\nFernán rides at your shoulder, silent. He's served you long enough to know when you want conversation and when you want the road. Tonight, he gives you the road.\n\nThe stars emerge. Orion. The Pleiades. The same stars that hung over Granada when the city fell, over Toledo when Fernando was born, over the storm that took seventy-five of your men.\n\nYour mind clears with each mile. The Vatican's games, the French whispers, Torquemada's hook—all of it recedes. Ahead is Ostia. Your ships. Your men. Something real.\n\nOstia Harbor\nNight\n\nTorches burn along the quay. Your fleet rides at anchor—ten ships, dark shapes against the moonlit water. The Princess Catalina sits proudest among them, the flagship you commissioned for this journey.\n\nThe harbor watch recognizes your banner and word spreads fast. By the time you dismount, men are emerging from taverns and billets, pulling on clothes, straightening themselves. Not the 591 in Rome—these are the sailors, the ship's officers, the skeleton crews keeping the fleet ready.\n\nA grizzled figure pushes through the gathering crowd. Captain Sebastián de Morales, master of the Princess Catalina, veteran of the Málaga blockade. He bows stiffly—a sailor's bow, not a courtier's.\n\n\"Your Majesty. We weren't expecting—\" He stops himself. \"The ships are ready. Whatever you need.\"\n\nThe salt wind pulls at your cloak. The harbor water laps against the hulls.

Signals, formations, sail handling—that wants daylight and sea room, not harbor at night. But if it's council you're after, getting the captains around a table to plan, talk through maneuvers before we execute them...\" He shrugs. \"That can happen whenever Your Majesty commands. The Catalina's great cabin has room enough.\"\n\nFernán has dismounted beside you, saying nothing, but you can feel his curiosity. Naval exercises, two days before a papal audience. He's wondering what you're thinking.\n\nMorales adds, practically: \"The men have had weeks of idleness, Majesty. Waiting in harbor while Rome decides things.\" There's no accusation in his tone, just observation. \"A king who comes to drill them, who shows he remembers they exist—that's worth something. Whether tonight or dawn.\"\n\nHe waits for your decision."

For Constantinople.\n\nThe great cabin is smaller than a palace chamber but larger than any other ship could offer. A heavy table dominates the center, bolted to the deck. Charts already spread across it—the Italian coast, the route to Rhodes, the Aegean approaches.\n\nMorales lights lanterns while you wait.\n\nOne by one, the captains arrive. Some neat, some rumpled from hasty waking. Ten men commanding ten ships—what remains of your expedition fleet after the Mistral took her toll. They file in, bow, find places around the table.

Key findings: flag signals were useless in the storm; ships fought alone; different ships had vastly different warning times (the San Marcos had 15 minutes thanks to veteran lookout Pascual, while the Nuestra Senora had only 5 minutes and lost 11 men). The council establishes a new storm warning system: dedicated weather watches on carracks with experienced lookouts; a cannon signal (any carrack fires immediately upon spotting a storm); and a six-step emergency procedure (all hands on deck, shorten sail, secure cargo/horses, rig lifelines, man pumps, take predetermined heading). Formation doctrine is set: four carracks on the corners with the Catalina at the head, five transports in the center. Fleet readiness: 9 of 10 ships can sail (the Buenaventura has a slow leak below the waterline requiring repair). The drill is planned for the next morning, one hour after first light, with a competition element (drinks for the fastest crew).",

That's how it was.\"\n\nA younger captain—Gaspar de Vega of the Santa Clara—shifts uncomfortably. \"We saw the flags from the Catalina. The signal to form line and run southeast, away from the coast.\" He hesitates. \"We saw them. But by the time we read them, the squall was already on us. I had men fighting canvas, the helm bucking like a mule. I couldn't hold course to follow anyone. I did what I had to do to keep my ship alive.\"\n\nNods around the table. No one contradicts him.\n\nDiego Fernández, master of the San Marcos—an older man, grey-bearded, survivor of a dozen campaigns—leans forward. \"Flag signals in a Mistral are like shouting across a battlefield when the cannons fire. Everyone's too busy staying alive to look up.\" He spreads his hands. \"It's not a failing of the men. It's a failing of the method. Flags need clear sky, calm sea, time to read and respond. A storm gives you none of that.\"\n\n\"We lost sight of each other within minutes,\" adds Rodrigo Ibáñez of the Nuestra Señora. His voice is quieter—he lost eleven men. \"The rain came horizontal. Couldn't see the ship ahead, couldn't see the ship behind. I didn't know who'd survived until we limped into Cagliari two days later and started counting masts.\"\n\nMorales picks up the thread again. \"Your Majesty asked if the signals were useful. Honest answer: no. Not once the storm was on us. Maybe—maybe—if we'd had more warning, if we'd formed up before the weather turned, the signals might have kept us together. But once the wind hit...\" He shakes his head.\n\nAnother captain—Luis de Córdoba of the Santiago Apóstol—clears his throat. He's been quiet until now, arms crossed, face unreadable.\n\n\"There's another problem, Majesty. We've never drilled this. Not properly. Every captain in this cabin knows his own ship, knows how to fight a storm alone. But fighting a storm together? Keeping formation when the sea wants to scatter us? Knowing where to regroup if we lose sight?\" He looks around the table. \"We've never practiced it. We assumed we'd figure it out when the time came.\"\n\nA heavy silence.\n\n\"We figured it out,\" he finishes quietly. \"Seventy-five men paid for the lesson.\"\n\nThe lantern flames flicker. Ten captains wait to hear what their king makes of their honesty."

Not everyone will have the same experience.\n\nThe captains exchange glances. This is the right question, and they know it.\n\nMorales turns to the man on his left. \"Gaspar. You were on the northern edge of the formation. What did you see?\"\n\nGaspar de Vega leans forward, remembering. \"We saw the cloud bank first. Low on the horizon, moving fast—dark grey with that yellow tinge underneath. I've seen Mistrals before, sailing out of Valencia. I knew what it was maybe... ten minutes before it hit us?\" He shrugs. \"Ten minutes. Enough to get the men on deck, shorten sail, secure loose cargo. Not enough to do more than that.\"\n\n\"We had less,\" says Rodrigo Ibáñez bitterly. \"The Nuestra Señora was on the southern edge, closer to the coast. Sardinia blocked our view of the northwest. First warning I had was when the Santa Clara's sails started thrashing. Then the wind was on us. Five minutes, maybe. Men were still coming up from below when the first wave broke over the bow.\"\n\nDiego Fernández—the old grey-beard—strokes his chin thoughtfully. \"I had a man in the crow's nest who's sailed the Gulf of Lion for twenty years. He called it before anyone. Saw the way the sea was changing—the chop getting shorter, angrier—before the clouds were even visible from the deck. He shouted down, I looked up, and I started giving orders.\" He pauses. \"Fifteen minutes. Maybe more. We had time to rig lifelines, double-lash the boats, get every man who couldn't swim tied to something solid.\"\n\n\"And you lost how many?\" Morales asks quietly.\n\n\"Three.\" Diego's voice is heavy. \"Three men. Not eleven. Not fifteen.\"\n\nThe difference hangs in the air. Fifteen minutes versus five minutes. Three dead versus fifteen dead.\n\nLuis de Córdoba uncrosses his arms. \"So the lesson is clear enough. The ships that saw it coming survived better. But seeing it coming depended on where you were in the formation, and whether you had a man aloft who knew what to look for.\"\n\n\"Not just aloft,\" adds another captain—Martín de Soria of the Reina del Mar. He's been quiet until now, a compact man with hands like knotted rope. \"Aloft and watching for weather, not watching for pirates or coastline. A dedicated weather eye. That's different from a normal lookout.\"\n\nMorales nods slowly. \"So. We post weather watches. Experienced men, eyes on the horizon, looking for exactly this. That's one thing.\"\n\n\"But that only helps the ship that sees it,\" Gaspar interjects. \"How do we tell the others? I saw the Mistral coming, I started preparing my own ship—I didn't have time to signal anyone else. And even if I had, what signal? We have flags for 'enemy sighted' and 'form line' and 'follow me.' Do we have a flag for 'storm coming, prepare immediately'?\"\n\nSilence around the table.\n\n\"No,\" Morales admits. \"We don't.\"\n\nDiego Fernández taps the table. \"Flags won't work anyway, not if the weather's already turning. You need something faster. Something you can't miss even if you're not looking.\"\n\n\"Cannon,\" says Luis de Córdoba flatly. \"One gun. Every captain knows: a single gun fired outside of battle means attend, something is wrong. Three guns in succession—that could mean storm warning. You hear cannon, you don't need to see anything. You react.\"\n\n\"Expensive,\" mutters someone. \"Powder and shot, every time the sky looks grey.\"\n\n\"Cheaper than seventy-five men,\" Luis replies, and no one argues.\n\nMorales looks to you, Majesty. \"A dedicated weather watch with experienced eyes. A cannon signal for immediate danger—something every ship will hear regardless of visibility. And perhaps...\" he hesitates, \"a predetermined plan for what to do when we hear it. Not waiting for flag orders that may never come. Every captain knowing: if you hear three guns, you shorten sail, rig lifelines, secure cargo, and make for the nearest safe bearing. No waiting for instructions.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands over the charts.\n\n\"What else would Your Majesty have us consider?\""

Genoese contracts. They gave us hulls to carry men and horses, not to fight. I've got crossbows and some hand-gonnes for boarding defense. No bombards.\"\n\n\"Same,\" mutters Alonso Pardo of the San Vicente. \"We were never meant for battle.\"\n\nMorales folds his arms. \"So four ships can't give the signal. And if they're the ones who see the storm first...\" He doesn't finish the sentence. He doesn't need to.\n\nLuis de Córdoba drums his fingers on the table. \"We could redistribute. Take one bombard from the Catalina, one from the San Marcos, put them on two of the unarmed ships. That leaves only two without.\"\n\n\"Or,\" Martín de Soria offers, \"we assign the unarmed ships to positions in the formation where they'll never be the first to see weather coming. Keep them in the center, let the armed ships hold the edges.\"\n\n\"That might work for a Mistral,\" Diego says slowly. \"Comes from the northwest, predictable direction. But other storms? Squalls can come from anywhere.\"\n\nGaspar de Vega raises a hand. \"There's another option. Horns. A ship's horn, blown in a pattern—three long blasts, say—carries almost as far as a cannon shot. Every ship has a horn. Every ship can make that signal.\"\n\n\"Not as far as cannon,\" Luis counters. \"Not in heavy wind. The sound gets swallowed.\"\n\n\"Better than nothing for the ships that have nothing,\" Gaspar replies.\n\nMorales looks to you. \"So we have choices, Majesty. Redistribute the guns we have. Rely on formation discipline to keep unarmed ships protected. Use horns as a secondary signal. Or...\" he pauses, \"we find four bombards in Rome or Naples before we sail for Constantinople, and make sure every ship can speak when it needs to.\""

          "text": "The user's fleet seems to be a mix of vessels. Earlier in the campaign, I recall mentions of:\n- The Princess Catalina as a flagship (likely a carrack, commissioned specifically for this voyage)\n- Some new carracks that were built\n- Genoese transport vessels under contract\n\nFrom Chapter 2.14, I can see:\n- The Princess Catalina (flagship) is complete\n- Three of five new carracks complete and seaworthy\n- Eight Genoese transport vessels under contract\n\nSo the fleet of 10 ships would be:\n- 1 flagship (Princess Catalina) - probably the largest carrack\n- 3 new carracks\n- 6 Genoese transports (but wait, 8 were contracted... let me check)\n\nActually looking at the table the user created, there are 10 ships total:\n1. Princess Catalina - Morales (flagship, 4 cannons)\n2. San Marcos - Diego Fernández (2 cannons)\n3. Santiago Apóstol - Luis de Córdoba (2 cannons)\n4. Santa Clara - Gaspar de Vega (1 cannon)\n5. Nuestra Señora - Rodrigo Ibáñez (0 cannons)\n6. Reina del Mar - Martín de Soria (1 cannon)\n7. San Vicente - Alonso Pardo (0 cannons)\n8. Esperanza - Tomás de Lepe (0 cannons)\n\n9. Santa María de la Mar - Francisco Ruiz (1 cannon)\n10. Buenaventura - Cristóbal Medina (0 cannons)\n\nI notice the ships without cannons are likely Genoese transports, while those with cannons are probably carracks. The Princess Catalina, with its 4 cannons, stands out as the flagship and likely the most heavily armed vessel. The other armed ships - San Marcos, Santiago Apóstol, Santa Clara, Reina del Mar, and Santa María de la Mar - represent the carrack contingent of the fleet.\n\nI'd recommend consulting an experienced captain like Morales for precise details about the crow's nests and lookout positions on these vessels. While the carracks would certainly have crow's nests, the Genoese transports might feature more rudimentary observation points.\n\nMorales nods, seeing where you're heading.\n\n\"Aye, Majesty. The carracks have the height.\" He gestures around the cabin. \"The Catalina here, the San Marcos, the Santiago Apóstol, the Santa Clara—these are proper three-masted carracks. Crow's nests on the mainmast, thirty feet up or more. A man up there can see weather coming from leagues away, well before anyone on deck.\"\n\nHe pauses, does the mental count.\n\n\"Four carracks with proper crow's nests. The rest—\" he glances at Rodrigo Ibáñez and the other transport captains, \"—are Genoese cogs and transports. Lower profile. They have lookout positions, but not the same height. A man on a transport's mast sees maybe half the distance.\"\n\nDiego Fernández, the grey-beard, adds: \"It's why I saw the Mistral first on the San Marcos. Height. My man was looking down on the weather while the transports were still blind to it.\"\n\nLuis de Córdoba traces a finger across the chart, thinking aloud. \"So the carracks become our eyes. We position them at the edges of the formation—north, south, east, west. Transports in the center. The carracks watch the horizon, and when they see something...\" He mimes a cannon firing.\n\n\"The transports hear the signal and prepare, even if they can't see the danger themselves,\" Gaspar finishes.\n\nMorales turns to you. \"Four carracks, four corners. It could work, Majesty. We'd need to drill it—make sure every captain knows his position, knows to hold it even when the sea gets rough. But the bones of a system are there.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then adds: \"The Catalina has the tallest mainmast in the fleet. If Your Majesty wants the sharpest eyes in the highest nest, this is the ship to carry them. The question is—do we keep the flagship in the center where she's protected, or put her on the edge where she can see?\""

The transport captains especially - they lost men, they know what went wrong on their ships.\n\nThe question lands on the table like a challenge. The transport captains shift in their seats—this is their domain now, their failures to reckon with.\n\nRodrigo Ibáñez speaks first. He lost eleven men. He's thought about this every night since Cagliari.\n\n\"First thing—all hands on deck. Every man, no exceptions. The ones below when the storm hits are the ones who drown when the hull breaches or the hatch seals them in.\" His voice is steady, but his knuckles are white on the table's edge. \"I had men still climbing up when the first wave took us. They never had a chance.\"\n\nAlonso Pardo of the San Vicente nods grimly. \"Shorten sail. Immediately. You hear that cannon, you don't wait to see how bad it is. You reef everything down to storm canvas or bare poles. A ship with too much sail up in a Mistral—\" he shakes his head. \"The wind will roll you over or tear your masts out.\"\n\n\"Secure cargo,\" adds Tomás de Lepe of the Esperanza. \"Especially the horses. A panicked horse breaking loose below decks in heavy seas...\" He doesn't finish. Everyone's seen it. \"Lash them tight, hobble them if you have to. Same with water barrels, weapons, anything that can shift.\"\n\nDiego Fernández, the grey-beard who lost only three men, ticks off on his fingers: \"Lifelines rigged bow to stern. Every man who can't swim—tied to something solid. Hatches secured but not sealed, you need to be able to get below if you must. Bilge pumps manned and ready.\"\n\n\"And know where you're going,\" Martín de Soria adds quietly. \"Before the signal even comes. Every captain should know: if a storm hits here, I run there. Predetermined bearing toward safe harbor or open sea, whichever's wiser. No hesitation, no waiting for orders that won't come.\"\n\nMorales has been listening, letting his captains speak. Now he summarizes:\n\n\"So. Three guns from a carrack means: all hands on deck, shorten sail, secure cargo and horses, rig lifelines, man the pumps, and run your predetermined heading.\" He looks around the table. \"That's six things. Every man on every ship needs to know all six, in that order. No thinking. Just doing.\"\n\nHe turns to you, Majesty.\n\n\"We could drill this tomorrow. Not a full storm drill at sea—but the preparation. Time each crew from cannon signal to ready-state. See who's fast, who's slow, who needs more practice.\" A grim smile. \"Make it a competition.

One gun has always meant attend—something's happening. Two guns could mean enemy sighted.\"\n\nGaspar de Vega nods. \"Two guns, then flags to show direction and size. We have flags for that already—compass bearing, number of sails.

Genoese pirates? A French squadron that claims we're in their waters?\" He shakes his head. \"Each demands something different.\"\n\nMorales turns to you. \"This is where the pre-voyage council matters most, Majesty. Before we sail, we agree: if we meet enemies in this stretch of water, we do this. Ottomans near Rhodes—we form line and fight, we have knights aboard who'll want to close and board.

The captains are practical men - they'll want clarity on details:\n\n1. Who gives the cannon signal? The ship that \"spots\" the storm, or always the flagship?\n2. What counts as \"complete\"? All six steps done?\n3. Formation positions - who takes which corner?\n4. What time do they sail?\n5. How far out before the exercise begins?\n\nLet me have the captains ask practical questions that show they're engaged and thinking this through.\n\nA ripple of approval goes around the table at the mention of drinks. Sailors are sailors.\n\nGaspar de Vega raises a hand. \"Who fires the signal, Majesty? The ship whose lookout spots the 'storm'? Or does he alert the flagship first and the Catalina fires?\"\n\nIt's a practical question. In a real emergency, waiting to relay information costs precious minutes. But having signals come from unexpected quarters could cause confusion.\n\nDiego Fernández follows with another. \"The six steps—all hands, shorten sail, secure cargo, rig lifelines, man pumps, take heading—some take longer than others. When we blow the horn to signal completion, what's the standard? All six done? Or ready to weather the storm, even if the pumps aren't yet manned because there's no water coming in?\"\n\nLuis de Córdoba leans back. \"Formation positions. Do we assign them now? Which carrack takes which corner?\"\n\nMartín de Soria glances at the transport captains. \"And the transports—do they hold fixed positions relative to us, or simply stay 'in the middle' however that falls out?\"\n\nFinally, Rodrigo Ibáñez—quiet, still carrying the weight of eleven dead—asks the simplest question: \"What hour do we sail, Majesty?\"\n\nThe lanterns flicker. Outside, the harbor water laps against the Catalina's hull. Ten captains—nine who will sail tomorrow—wait for your answers."

No, as soon as you spot a storm, you fire.\n\n\nTomorrow, I will arrange in secret when and where the signal will come. I wont tell you yet, just be ready.\n\n\nYou blow the horn when all six steps are completed and your bow points at Ostia harbour.

Let me think about whether there are any remaining questions or if they're satisfied.\n\nThis is a good moment for the captains to express understanding and perhaps some enthusiasm. The meeting has been productive - they've established:\n- Weather watches on carracks with experienced lookouts\n- Three cannon signal for storm\n- Six-step procedure: all hands, shorten sail, secure cargo, rig lifelines, man pumps, take heading\n- Formation with carracks on corners, transports in middle\n- Pre-voyage councils to establish plans\n- Competition element with drinks for fastest crew\n\nI should have the captains acknowledge, perhaps show some enthusiasm or camaraderie, and then close out the meeting.

Whatever state they're in, they'll be aboard by dawn. Might be the fastest crew on the water tomorrow—they'll want to get back to harbor and lie down.\"\n\nLaughter around the table. The tension of the evening has eased. These men came in uncertain why their king had ridden through the night to summon them. Now they know. They have purpose.\n\nDiego Fernández, the grey-beard, speaks for all of them. \"Your Majesty. After the Mistral...\" He pauses, choosing words carefully. \"Some of us wondered if we'd ever sail together again as a proper fleet. Wondered if we'd be scattered to different commands, or blamed for what happened.\" He meets your eyes. \"This—tonight—this is what we needed. A king who asks questions and listens to answers. A plan that makes sense. A chance to prove we've learned.\"\n\nMurmurs of agreement.\n\nMorales stands. \"If there's nothing else, Majesty, I'll dismiss the captains to their ships.

          "text": "Earlier in the conversation, Diego Fernández mentioned: \"I had a man in the crow's nest who's sailed the Gulf of Lion for twenty years. He called it before anyone. Saw the way the sea was changing—the chop getting shorter, angrier—before the clouds were even visible from the deck.\"\n\nSo this is a veteran sailor with 20+ years experience in the Gulf of Lion (the area between Spain and France, known for the Mistral wind). He recognized the signs of the Mistral before it was visible.\n\nI should have Diego introduce this man. I need to create a name and character for this experienced lookout. Let me think of a suitable Spanish name for a sailor with this experience.\n\nI'll create this character:\n- Experienced sailor, 20+ years in the Gulf of Lion\n- Knows weather patterns intimately\n- Probably older, weathered\n- His experience saved lives\n\nLet me write this scene where Diego brings this man forward for Juan to meet.\n\nThe San Marcos\nEarly Morning, March 21, 1434\n\nDiego Fernández's weathered face shows a flicker of surprise, then something like pride. He nods slowly.\n\n\"Aye, Majesty. You'll want to meet Pascual.\"\n\nHe turns and bellows up toward the rigging. \"Pascual! Down here! Now!\"\n\nA moment passes. Then a figure begins descending from the mainmast with the easy grace of a man who's spent more of his life aloft than on solid ground. He drops the last few feet to the deck and turns.\n\nPascual is perhaps fifty, perhaps older—the sea ages men strangely. His face is leather-brown and deeply lined, his hands rope-scarred and strong. He's small and wiry, the build of a man who fits comfortably in a crow's nest. His eyes are the pale grey of a winter sky, and they meet yours without flinching.\n\nHe doesn't bow. Perhaps he doesn't know how. Diego clears his throat meaningfully, and Pascual offers an awkward bob of his head.\n\n\"Majesty,\" he says. His voice is rough, accented—Catalan, perhaps, or somewhere along the Aragonese coast.\n\n\"This is the man,\" Diego says. \"Twenty-three years sailing the Gulf of Lion before he signed on with me. Knows the Mistral like a wife who's tried to kill him more than once.\"\n\nA few nearby sailors chuckle. Pascual's expression doesn't change.\n\n\"Tell His Majesty what you told me,\" Diego prompts. \"What you saw before the storm hit.\"\n\nPascual scratches his jaw, considers.\n\n\"The sea tells you first,\" he says slowly. \"Before the clouds, before the wind. The waves get shorter. Choppier. They stop rolling and start fighting each other. Then the birds—\" he gestures vaguely skyward, \"—they go quiet. Disappear. They know before we do.\"\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n\"I've seen it enough times. Felt it in my knees, maybe. I called down to Captain Diego. He listened.\" A pause. \"Not every captain listens.\""

The Catalina has 8 and the other carracks have more? That would mean the other carracks have more than 8. That seems like a lot for a 15th century carrack. Maybe the GM meant \"the other carracks have some as well\"?\n\nI'll keep it somewhat vague and let Diego show Juan whatever cannons the San Marcos has, describing the scene naturally. If the player wants to correct the number, they can.\n\nThe San Marcos\nGun Deck\n\nDiego nods and gestures for you to follow. Pascual melts back toward the rigging—his place is aloft, not among kings and cannons.\n\nThe San Marcos is a working ship, not a flagship, and it shows. The deck is clean but worn, the wood weathered by years of salt and sun. Diego leads you toward the ship's waist, where the guns are mounted.\n\n\"She's no Catalina,\" Diego says, a note of apology in his voice, \"but she bites when she needs to.\"\n\nThe cannons are smaller than proper siege bombards—naval guns, meant for signaling and close-range work rather than battering walls. They're well-maintained, the bronze gleaming dully in the morning light, the carriages freshly greased.\n\nDiego calls out: \"Bernardo! Tomás! Attend!\"\n\nTwo men approach. Bernardo is thick-necked and broad, with arms like anchor chains and powder burns on his forearms—old marks, the signatures of his trade. He moves with the careful economy of a man who works with things that can kill him. Tomás is younger, leaner, with quick eyes and nimble fingers. The experienced gunner and his apprentice, you'd wager.\n\nThey bow—properly, unlike Pascual.\n\n\"Majesty,\" Bernardo says. \"The guns are ready. Charged them at first light when we heard about the exercise.\" He hesitates, glances at Diego. \"Blank charges, of course. No shot. Powder and wadding only.\"\n\n\"Show His Majesty,\" Diego orders.\n\nBernardo walks you through it—the powder stored in the magazine below, the wadding, the slow match kept burning in a covered tub, the firing procedure. His hands move over the gun with the unconscious familiarity of long practice.\n\n\"How fast can you fire?\" you ask."

Tomás and I work them both, but properly you want two men per gun—one to load, one to aim and fire. In battle, Captain Diego gives us two deck hands to assist.\" He gestures to the younger man. \"Tomás here has been with me four years. Knows enough not to blow us all to heaven.\"\n\nTomás grins but says nothing.\n\n\"Safety,\" Bernardo continues, his tone growing serious. \"Powder stays below in the magazine until we need it. Sealed tight, away from spark or flame. Only I go down there—no lanterns, no metal tools that might strike a spark. We bring up charges one at a time in leather cartridges.\"\n\nHe points to a covered wooden tub nearby, a thin wisp of smoke curling from beneath the lid.\n\n\"Slow match. Stays lit, stays covered. Never near the powder. Never.\" He shows his powder-burned forearms. \"I learned young what happens when you forget.\"\n\nHe walks you through the firing sequence: load powder, tamp wadding, aim, uncover the slow match, touch it to the vent, step back. The whole process takes perhaps a minute with a trained crew, he explains. Faster if you're not being careful. But careful keeps men alive.\n\n\"For today's exercise—three shots in succession for the storm signal, yes?\" He looks to Diego, then back to you. \"We can do that in three minutes, maybe less. Reload between each shot. Tomás prepares the next charge while I fire.\"\n\nDiego stands with arms folded, watching his gunner with evident pride."

Or the quiet pride of a man who has spent his life being overlooked, now trusted with something that matters.\n\n\"One hour past zenith. I'll be ready.\"\n\nHe gives that same awkward bob of the head—his version of a bow—and turns to go back to his place in the rigging.

When the San Marcos fires the cannon signal (unexpected by other ships who were watching the flagship), most crews hesitate in confusion before reacting. The carracks perform adequately but the transports struggle badly. The San Vicente's hungover crew takes 15 minutes. The Nuestra Senora blows her horn prematurely without completing all six steps. The Esperanza gets lifelines tangled. The Santa Maria de la Mar struggles with panicking horses. The San Marcos completes fastest at under 6 minutes (aided by knowing the signal source), the Santiago Apostol matches closely. The Catalina completes in 7 minutes. The fleet's turn back to Ostia dissolves into disorder, ships straggling in over an hour. After-action reports reveal specific failures: crews watching the flagship instead of horizons, cargo stowage not optimized for quick securing, incomplete procedures, and poor coordination. Juan declares the San Marcos the winner and awards them the barrel of Umbrian red. Every ship receives a cask of ale.",

Even good outcomes should show room for improvement.\n\nD100: Fleet Storm Drill Exercise\n\nThe Situation: Nine ships sail to open water in formation—four carracks on the corners, five transports in the center. One hour past zenith, Pascual on the San Marcos will shout that he sees a Mistral. Bernardo fires three cannon shots. Every crew must execute the six steps: all hands on deck, shorten sail, secure cargo, rig lifelines, man pumps, take heading for Ostia. First ship to complete all six and blow their horn wins drinks for their crew.\n\nSuccess Factors\n\nClear briefing last night—every captain knows the plan\n\nGood weather: mild southwest wind, calm seas, daylight\n\nMotivated crews competing for prize\n\nCaptains discussed Mistral failures openly; lessons fresh in mind\n\nSignal comes from unexpected quarter—tests genuine readiness\n\nJuan's personal attention has focused the men\n\nFailure Factors\n\nFirst time drilling this together—theory versus practice\n\nSan Vicente crew hungover from shore leave\n\nSanta Clara's rigging repairs untested under pressure\n\nCrews likely watching Catalina for signal, not San Marcos\n\nTransports have horses aboard—securing them takes time\n\nFormation sailing itself is unpracticed\n\nSome confusion inevitable in first execution\n\nThe Table\n\n1-5: Disaster\nSomething goes badly wrong. A ship collides with another during the scramble to shorten sail. Or a sailor falls from the rigging in his haste. Or the Santa Clara's repaired rigging fails under sudden stress. The exercise reveals not just unpreparedness but exposes a serious flaw—perhaps in equipment, perhaps in crew discipline—that must be addressed before Constantinople. No one is timing their responses; they're fishing a man from the water or assessing damage. The lesson learned is brutal but valuable: they were not ready. Not even close.\n\n6-15: Confusion\nThe signal catches the fleet entirely off-guard. Crews look toward the Catalina expecting the signal from there—precious seconds lost in confusion when the cannon fire comes from the San Marcos instead. Some captains hesitate, unsure if it's a real emergency. The six steps happen, but ragged and slow. Crews stumble over each other. Cargo that should have been pre-positioned for quick securing isn't. The transports struggle badly with the horses. The fastest ship completes in nearly fifteen minutes; the slowest takes twice that. The formation scatters rather than turning in unison. Plenty of lessons learned, few of them comfortable.\n\n16-30: Ragged but Functional\nThe drill happens, but it's ugly. The carracks perform adequately—their crews are more experienced, their captains more seasoned. The transports struggle. The San Vicente's hungover crew moves like men wading through mud. One transport blows their horn prematurely, having forgotten to man the pumps. Another gets their lifelines tangled. The fleet turns toward Ostia eventually, but not together—ships straggling in over the course of an hour. The fastest carrack completes in eight minutes; most transports take twelve to fifteen. Clear that more drilling is needed, but the foundation is there.\n\n17-45: Mixed Results\nSome ships shine, others stumble. The San Marcos naturally responds fastest—they knew it was coming and their gun crew was ready—but at least one other carrack matches them closely, their lookout having spotted Pascual's shout and reacted instantly. The transports show wide variance: one or two execute the six steps with surprising crispness; others fumble through it. The hungover San Vicente crew performs either much better than expected (shame is motivating) or much worse (ale is unforgiving). Average completion time around ten minutes. The fleet turns for Ostia in something resembling formation. A solid first attempt with clear areas for improvement.\n\n46-60: Competent Execution\nThe surprise works as intended—crews weren't watching the San Marcos, and the signal catches them genuinely unprepared—but they recover well. The briefing from last night proves its worth; men know what to do even when startled. The six steps happen in proper sequence across most ships. Cargo securing takes longest, especially on transports with horses, but no major failures. Fastest completion around six minutes, slowest around twelve. The fleet turns for Ostia as a group, not quite in formation but not scattered either. Morales observes with professional satisfaction: not perfect, but far better than the Mistral. The drinks will be well-earned tonight.\n\n61-75: Strong Performance\nThe fleet surprises itself. When the San Marcos fires, there's a heartbeat of confusion—then training takes over. Crews move with purpose. The competition element drives them: every ship wants those drinks. The transports, determined not to be shown up by the carracks, execute the six steps with unexpected precision. Even the San Vicente's hungover crew, perhaps desperate to prove themselves, puts in a creditable performance. Fastest completion around five minutes; even the slowest finishes in under ten. The formation holds as ships turn for Ostia. Captains will have useful notes for improvement, but the foundation is solid. These men could survive a real storm now—not just endure it, but work through it together.\n\n76-85: Impressive Coordination\nSomething clicks. Maybe it's the clarity of last night's briefing. Maybe it's the pride of men who lost shipmates in the Mistral and refuse to let it happen again. When the signal comes, the fleet responds like a single organism. The carracks' lookouts spot the gun smoke and relay immediately. Crews are on deck and working within seconds. The six steps flow one into the next. The fastest ship—perhaps the Catalina herself, perhaps one of the other carracks—completes in under four minutes. The transports finish in six or seven. Horns blow across the water in quick succession. The turn for Ostia is crisp, formation maintained. Morales is genuinely impressed. Other captains are grinning. This is what a fleet should look like.\n\n86-95: Exceptional\nThe drill exceeds all expectations. The surprise element does exactly what it should—proves that these crews can respond to the unexpected—and they respond magnificently. The memory of the Mistral, the seventy-five dead, the ships fighting alone in the darkness—it's been transformed from trauma into determination. Every ship executes the six steps in under six minutes. The turn for Ostia is parade-ground precise. When the fleet sails back into harbor, other vessels in port stop to watch: nine ships moving as one, a demonstration of coordination that speaks of serious intent. The captains will identify small improvements, but the bones of this system are strong. These men are ready for whatever the sea throws at them.\n\n96-100: Providence\nSomething extraordinary happens. Perhaps one of the transports spots an actual weather change on the horizon—not a Mistral, but a squall forming—minutes before Pascual gives his signal. The drill becomes real. The fleet executes the six steps not as exercise but as genuine preparation, and when the squall hits (brief, not dangerous, but real), they weather it in perfect formation. Or perhaps the drill goes so smoothly, so quickly, that there's time for a second run—this time with the signal coming from a different ship—and the second execution is even better than the first. The men return to Ostia not just trained but transformed, knowing in their bones that they can trust each other when the sea turns against them. Stories of this day will be told for years.\n\nShall I roll, or do you have a d100 ready?"

          "text": "The morning passes pleasantly enough. Nine ships sail out of Ostia in loose formation, the carracks taking their positions at the corners, the transports clustering in the center. The southwest wind fills the sails gently. The sea is calm, almost glassy. Perfect conditions.\n\nToo perfect, perhaps. The men grow comfortable. Relaxed.\n\nYou stand at the Catalina's stern rail, watching your fleet. From here you can see the San Marcos on the northwestern corner, Diego Fernández's ship riding easy in the light swell. Somewhere up her mainmast, Pascual waits.\n\nThe sun climbs toward zenith, then begins its descent.\n\nOne hour past midday. You watch the San Marcos.\n\nNothing.\n\nThen—a distant shout, thin across the water. And three cannon shots in rapid succession, the sound rolling across the sea like thunder.\n\nFor a heartbeat, nothing happens.\n\nThen chaos.\n\nThe Response\n\nOn the Catalina, Morales reacts instantly—bellowing orders, sending men scrambling up the rigging. Your flagship's crew is the best in the fleet, and it shows. But even here, there's confusion. Men look toward you, toward Morales, toward the San Marcos—loss of precious seconds as they process that the signal came from somewhere unexpected.\n\nAcross the water, you watch the drill unfold. And your heart sinks.\n\nThe Santiago Apóstol responds well—Luis de Córdoba runs a tight ship. But the Santa Clara hesitates, Gaspar de Vega's crew clearly caught off-guard, their attention on the flagship rather than the horizon. The repaired rigging holds, thank God, but their movements are sluggish. Uncertain.\n\nThe transports are worse.\n\nThe San Vicente—Alonso Pardo's ship with the hungover crew—moves like men wading through honey. Sailors stumble into each other. Someone drops a coil of rope. You can hear faint shouting, though not the words. It's painful to watch.\n\nOn the Nuestra Señora, Rodrigo Ibáñez's ship, a horn blows. Too soon. Far too soon. There's no way they've completed all six steps. Someone got eager, or confused, or simply forgot the sequence. The horn falls silent, and you imagine the captain's fury.\n\nThe Esperanza gets her lifelines tangled. You watch two sailors struggling with rope that should have been laid out ready. Minutes lost.\n\nOne of the transports—the Santa María de la Mar—has horses aboard. You can hear them now, even across the water. Panicked whinnying. The securing is taking forever.\n\nThe Return\n\nThe fleet turns for Ostia. Eventually.\n\nThe Catalina completes the six steps in just over seven minutes—not shameful, but not impressive. The San Marcos, naturally, finishes fastest—they knew it was coming—at just under six minutes. The Santiago Apóstol matches them closely.\n\nBut the transports straggle. Eight minutes. Ten. Twelve. The San Vicente limps in at nearly fifteen, her crew moving like ghosts.\n\nThe formation dissolves entirely during the turn. Ships that should hold position relative to each other scatter, each captain focused on his own vessel rather than the fleet. You sail back to Ostia not as a coordinated force but as nine separate ships that happen to be heading the same direction.\n\nThe Catalina drops anchor first. Then the carracks. Then, one by one, the transports limp in over the course of nearly an hour.\n\nThe Assessment\n\nMorales stands beside you at the rail, watching the last ships anchor. His face is carefully neutral, but you can read the disappointment in the set of his shoulders.\n\n\"It worked,\" he says finally. \"The signal, the response, the six steps. It all happened.\" A pause. \"But ragged, Majesty. Very ragged. The carracks did well enough. The transports...\" He shakes his head. \"They need more drilling. Much more.\"\n\nHe turns to face you.\n\n\"The good news: no one was hurt. No collisions. The Santa Clara's rigging held. And every captain now knows exactly where his crew failed.\" A grim smile. \"That knowledge cost us nothing but pride today. In a real Mistral, it would have cost lives.\"\n\nAcross the harbor, longboats are being lowered. The captains will be coming to report. To explain. To hear your judgment.\n\n\"The drinks, Majesty.\" Morales raises an eyebrow. \"The San Marcos was fastest, but they knew the signal was coming. Do we reward them? Or the Santiago Apóstol, who matched them without foreknowledge?\""

The question is whether Bernardo was told in advance to listen for Pascual specifically, or whether Bernardo just reacted to hearing anyone shout \"Mistral.\"\n \nPascual likely maintained discretion while ensuring operational readiness. He might have subtly signaled his crew to be more attentive without revealing the full plan. His quiet word to Bernardo would have been professional and minimal - just enough to coordinate the critical moment without compromising the mission's secrecy.\n\nThe Princess Catalina\nGreat Cabin Antechamber\n\nYou catch Pascual's arm before he enters the cabin, drawing him aside into the narrow passage. The other captains file past, glancing curiously but saying nothing.\n\nWhen you're alone, Pascual meets your eyes with that same steady grey gaze.\n\n\"Bernardo,\" he says quietly, before you even ask the question. \"The gunner. I had to tell him to listen for my shout. Otherwise—\" he shrugs, \"—he's watching the horizon like everyone else, not watching me. The signal doesn't fire fast enough.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"I told him nothing else. Not when. Not why me. Just: 'When I shout Mistral, you fire. Don't wait, don't ask, just fire.'\" The ghost of that rare smile crosses his face. \"He thought I'd gone mad. But he's worked with me six years. He trusts my eyes.\"\n\nHe shifts his weight, uncomfortable with this much talking.\n\n\"Captain Diego, the rest of the crew—they knew nothing. When I shouted, they scrambled like everyone else. Maybe half a breath faster, because they heard my voice above them instead of cannon across the water.\" He shakes his head. \"But they didn't know.\"\n\nHe waits, watching you. Wondering if he did right or wrong."

I have told him and only him that he was to give the signal. The rest of his ship knew nothing. They deserve the prize for the fastest ship today because they were also burdened with having to fire the cannons as well which they performed impeccably.\n\n\nSome other ships were suffering from hangover.

Diego Fernández claps him once on the shoulder—a sailor's approval.\n\nThen the reports begin.\n\nDiego Fernández, San Marcos:\n\nThe grey-beard speaks first, since his ship has been named.\n\n\"Pascual shouted. Bernardo fired. The rest of us scrambled like everyone else.\" He's honest, unwilling to take unearned credit. \"We were fast because we've drilled before—not this exact exercise, but storm preparation. My crew knows what 'all hands' means. They know where the lifelines are stored, where the cargo lashings are.\" He pauses. \"Six minutes. We can do better. The pumps were manned last—that's the wrong order if we're actually taking water. We'll fix it.\"\n\nLuis de Córdoba, Santiago Apóstol:\n\nThe tactician crosses his arms. \"We matched the San Marcos without knowing the signal was coming. I'll take that.\" No false modesty. \"But we got lucky. My lookout happened to be watching northwest when the guns fired. He saw the smoke, shouted down before the sound even reached us. If he'd been looking the other way...\" He shrugs. \"We need dedicated weather watches, like we discussed. A man whose only job is watching the horizon. I didn't have one today. I will tomorrow.\"\n\nGaspar de Vega, Santa Clara:\n\nThe younger captain looks uncomfortable. \"The rigging held. That's the good news.\" He runs a hand through his hair. \"The bad news—we hesitated. My crew was watching the Catalina, waiting for your signal, Majesty. When the cannon came from the San Marcos, there were three or four seconds where everyone just... looked at each other.\" He shakes his head. \"Three or four seconds. In a real storm, that's men dying. We need to drill the response until it's automatic. Until my men don't think, they just move.\"\n\nRodrigo Ibáñez, Nuestra Señora:\n\nThe man who lost eleven in the Mistral speaks quietly, his jaw tight with shame.\n\n\"We blew the horn early. That was my fault—I gave the order. I thought we'd completed the six steps.\" A pause. \"We hadn't. The pumps weren't manned. I was so focused on being fast that I forgot to be right.\" He meets your eyes. \"It won't happen again, Majesty. I've already told my crew: we run through the checklist out loud. Every step, called and confirmed. No horn until every man reports ready.\"\n\nMartín de Soria, Reina del Mar:\n\nThe compact captain with rope-scarred hands shrugs. \"We were middling. Not the fastest, not the slowest. No disasters, no glory.\" He's pragmatic. \"Our problem was cargo. We'd stowed some barrels this morning without thinking about quick access to the lashings. Took us an extra two minutes to secure what should have taken thirty seconds. From now on, we stow with the storm in mind, not just with space in mind.\"\n\nAlonso Pardo, San Vicente:\n\nThe captain of the hungover crew stands straight, refusing to make excuses.\n\n\"Fifteen minutes. Worst in the fleet.\" His voice is flat. \"My men were not fit for duty. That's my responsibility. I let them go ashore, I let them drink, I assumed they'd recover by morning.\" He looks around the cabin. \"They didn't. Half of them couldn't climb the rigging without stopping to retch. One man fell—caught himself on a line, but it could have been worse.\"\n\nHe takes a breath.\n\n\"No more shore leave the night before we sail. Ever. And any man who reports unfit for duty answers to me personally.\"\n\nTomás de Lepe, Esperanza:\n\nThe transport captain grimaces. \"The lifelines. God above, the lifelines.\" He rubs his face. \"They were stored properly, coiled and ready. But when we went to rig them, they'd gotten tangled with another line overnight. Someone was careless. Two of my men spent four minutes sorting rope while everyone else waited.\" He spreads his hands. \"We've changed the storage. Lifelines go in their own chest now, nothing else. And I've got the man who was careless splicing rope until his fingers bleed.\"\n\nFrancisco Ruiz, Santa María de la Mar:\n\nThe captain with horses aboard speaks last among the transport captains. His voice is weary.\n\n\"The horses. You all heard them.\" A few captains nod—the panicked whinnying carried across the water. \"They felt the crew's urgency and spooked. Once one started, they all started. My men couldn't get close enough to secure them without risking a kick to the skull.\"\n\nHe sighs.\n\n\"We need a different approach. Hobbles on before we leave harbor, not after the signal. Hoods for the nervous ones. And handlers who stay with them throughout the voyage, so they're calm around familiar hands.\" He looks at you. \"Horses on ships are always trouble, Majesty. But we can make them less trouble with preparation.\"\n\nMorales, Princess Catalina:\n\nYour own captain speaks last.\n\n\"Seven minutes. Not shameful, but not what this ship should do.\" He's harder on himself than any of the others. \"We're the flagship. We should set the standard. We didn't.\"\n\nHe ticks off the failures: \"Crew was watching you, Majesty, not the horizon. When the signal came from elsewhere, they looked to me for confirmation before acting. That hesitation cost us. We also had men below who didn't hear the first gun—only came up after the third. Our internal signals need work.\"\n\nHe straightens.\n\n\"Tomorrow, we drill again. Just the Catalina, at anchor. Signal to ready-state, over and over, until my men can do it in their sleep.\"\n\nThe cabin falls quiet. Nine reports. Nine honest assessments. Nine sets of lessons learned.\n\nThe afternoon light has shifted to gold. The ale on the table remains untouched.\n\nThe captains wait for your response."

Granada University charter - papal approval for natural philosophy/sciences focus (not theology)\n5.

I should set the scene carefully and then STOP to let the player decide how Juan approaches the audience.\n\nPalazzo di San Marco\nMorning, March 22, 1434\n\nYou sleep deeply, dreamlessly—the exhaustion of a day at sea, the clarity of honest work. When you wake, grey dawn light filters through the shutters.\n\nLucia is already up, seated at the small table, reviewing something. She glances over as you stir.\n\n\"The summons came at first light,\" she says. \"The Holy Father will receive you at the tenth hour.\"\n\nThree hours. Time enough to prepare.\n\nServants bring breakfast—bread, cheese, olives, watered wine. You eat without tasting, your mind already moving ahead. Lucia helps you dress: not armor, not the crusader's white, but the formal attire of a Christian king. Dark velvet doublet, the Castilian arms embroidered at the breast. A gold chain of office. Your sword—ceremonial, but present. You are a king come to treat with the Vicar of Christ, not a penitent come to beg.\n\nFray Hernando arrives as you finish dressing. He looks tired—he has been praying, you suspect, much of the night.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He studies your face. \"Are you ready?\"\n\nThe question has layers. Ready for the ceremony, yes. Ready for whatever Eugenius will demand, will offer, will withhold? That remains to be seen.\n\nLucia adjusts your collar, a wifely gesture that settles something in your chest.\n\n\"Remember what we learned,\" she says quietly. \"He's desperate. He's cautious. He's been burned before.\" Her grey-green eyes meet yours. \"Show him you're different.\"\n\nThe Vatican\nTenth Hour\n\nThe walk to the Vatican is short but weighted. You bring only Fray Hernando and four guards—enough for dignity, not enough to threaten. The 591 knights remain at their billets. This is not a show of force.\n\nThe papal guards admit you through the bronze doors. A chamberlain in red robes leads you through corridors you remember from your first visit—was it only a year ago? The marble saints watch from their niches. The air smells of incense and old stone.\n\nFinally, a set of doors. The chamberlain announces you:\n\n\"His Most Catholic Majesty, Juan the Second, by the Grace of God King of Castile and León.\"\n\nThe doors open.\n\nThe chamber beyond is smaller than you expected—not the great audience hall but a private reception room. Tapestries on the walls, a fire burning low, windows looking out over Rome. A throne-like chair at one end, but not the formal papal throne.\n\nAnd there, rising from that chair as you enter:\n\nPope Eugenius IV.\n\nHe is perhaps fifty, thin-faced, with deep-set eyes that have seen too much disappointment. He wears simple white robes—no tiara, no ceremonial vestments. This is a private audience, then. Intimate.

          "text": "**What does Pope Eugenius IV want?**\n1. Survival - He's been under siege from Basel, the Colonna, Milan. His position is precarious.\n2. To keep papal authority intact - Basel's reforms threaten to reduce him to a figurehead\n3. Money - The Camera is desperate, the annates reform would cut 75% of revenue\n4. Juan's military support - 591 knights are a real force, and Juan has proven he can actually accomplish things\n5. The Constantinople expedition to succeed - It would strengthen his position against Basel\n6. To NOT appear weak or dependent on a foreign king\n7. To understand Juan's true loyalties - Is Juan with the Pope or with Basel? Como tried to walk a middle line.\n\n**What won't he say?**\n- How desperate his financial situation truly is\n- How much he fears/resents Basel's power\n- That he needs Juan more than Juan needs him\n- His concerns about Juan becoming too powerful\n- That the French cardinals in Rome have been whispering about Juan\n- His uncertainty about whether to trust Juan\n- Any direct criticism of Basel that could be used against him\n\n**The opening move:**\nJuan asked an open question - \"how has your holiness been faring\" - this is a polite invitation to share, but Eugenius is a politician. He won't simply unburden himself to someone he's not sure he can trust. He'll likely:\n1. Give a diplomatic non-answer\n2. Steer toward what HE wants to know - Juan's position on Basel\n3. Test Juan's loyalties before revealing anything\n\nThe failure factors for Juan's approach:\n- Juan mentioned Basel first - this immediately raises the question of where Juan's loyalties lie\n- The French faction has been whispering that Juan is too powerful, a threat\n- Eugenius has been burned before by trusting people (Cesarini, Sigismund)\n\n- Juan's opening is passive, seeming evasive and potentially calculating\n\nI see Juan's strategic positioning carefully. His approach balances multiple diplomatic considerations. The Reconquista victory provides moral credibility, while his 591 knights represent tangible military potential. His Como declaration demonstrates diplomatic nuance, attempting to bridge the papal-conciliar divide. By asking how he can help rather than making demands, Juan shows strategic humility. Cardinal Capranica's presence adds another layer of potential support and legitimacy to his overture.\n\nI've reviewed the context. Now let me think about this encounter carefully.\n\nNPC Analysis: Pope Eugenius IV\n\nWhat does Eugenius want?\n\nTo understand Juan's true loyalties (Basel or Rome?)\n\nTo secure Juan's military strength for papal interests\n\nTo NOT appear weak or dependent on a foreign king\n\nTo learn what Juan promised at Basel before revealing his own position\n\nMoney—the Camera is desperate, though he won't admit it\n\nThe Constantinople expedition to succeed (strengthens him against Basel)\n\nWhat won't he say?\n\nHow desperate his financial situation truly is\n\nHow much he fears Basel's power to depose him\n\nThat he needs Juan more than Juan needs him\n\nThat the French cardinals have been whispering warnings about Juan\n\nHis uncertainty about whether to trust a king who walks middle paths\n\nD100: Pope Eugenius IV's Initial Response\n\nThe Situation: Juan kneels, kisses the ring, and asks an open question about how the Pope has been faring before offering to help the Church. This is humble—but also evasive. Juan mentioned Basel first. Eugenius is a politician who has been burned before. He wants to know where Juan stands before revealing anything.\n\nSuccess Factors\n\nJuan completed the Reconquista—undeniable moral authority\n\n591 knights ready for Constantinople—action, not words\n\nJuan's humility in asking before demanding\n\nCardinal Capranica present—signaled interest already\n\nFray Hernando respected by Vatican (Orsini questioned him for three hours about Juan's soul)\n\nJuan carries Emperor Sigismund's letter—united front\n\nFailure Factors\n\nJuan mentioned Basel first—raises loyalty question immediately\n\nFrench faction has been whispering warnings about Juan\n\nEugenius has been burned before (Cesarini sided with Council, Sigismund's mediation produced nothing)\n\nJuan's opening is passive—might seem like fishing for information before committing\n\nVatican deliberately maintained distance these past days—instructions from above\n\nOrsini, once warm, treated Fray Hernando as a stranger—something has changed\n\nThe Table\n\n1-10: Cold Suspicion\nEugenius's expression does not warm. He releases Juan's hand quickly, returns to his seat without invitation for Juan to rise. \"Basel. Yes. We have heard much of what was done at Basel.\" The emphasis is deliberate. \"We have also heard much of what was said—about parallel authorities, about reforms that would bind the Holy See.\" He lets the silence stretch. \"You speak of learning how We fare before determining how you might help. An interesting formulation. It suggests conditions. Prerequisites.\" His eyes are hard. \"We wonder, beloved son, whether you come as a servant of the Church—or as a negotiator with terms already prepared.\" He waits. This is an interrogation, not a welcome.\n\n11-25: Guarded Deflection\nEugenius smiles—thin, diplomatic, revealing nothing. \"How have We fared? As the Vicar of Christ always fares—carrying burdens that would crush lesser men, sustained only by grace.\" He gestures vaguely. \"But you did not ride through the night to hear an old man's complaints.\" He remains standing, not inviting Juan to rise—a subtle assertion of authority. \"You mention Basel. You were there for many months. You signed declarations. You spoke before the Council.\" He tilts his head. \"Perhaps, beloved son, you should tell Us how the Church fares—from the perspective of one who has walked among those who would reform her.\" The question beneath the question: whose side are you on?\n\n26-40: Polite Distance\n\"Rise, beloved son.\" Eugenius gestures, and Juan may stand—but the Pope does not embrace him, does not draw him close. He returns to his chair, settling into it with the careful movements of a man conserving strength. \"We have fared as God wills. The Church endures. She has endured worse than councils and politics.\" A pause. \"You speak of Basel. Cardinal Capranica—\" a glance at the silent cardinal, \"—has kept Us informed of your movements there. The Como declaration. Your speech before the Council. Your... bridge-building.\" The word is neutral, neither praise nor criticism. \"We are curious what you believe you accomplished. And what you believe remains to be done.\" He waits, offering nothing, seeking to draw Juan out.\n\n41-55: Testing the Waters\nEugenius studies Juan for a long moment after he kneels. Then, slowly, he extends his hand again—not for the ring, but to raise Juan up. \"Come. Sit.\" He gestures to a chair placed facing his own—an unusual informality. Cardinal Capranica remains standing, watchful. \"You ask how We fare. We shall answer honestly: We fare as a man who has learned that trust is a currency easily spent and slowly earned.\" His eyes hold Juan's. \"You went to Basel as a king with Our blessing. You returned having signed declarations with the Emperor, having spoken of reforms, having walked paths between factions.\" A pause. \"We do not yet know what to make of you, King Juan. The Reconquista speaks well of you. Your presence here with 600 knights speaks well. But Basel...\" He spreads his hands. \"Basel complicates things. Tell Us plainly: what do you want from this audience?\"\n\n56-70: Cautious Interest\nEugenius's expression softens—slightly. \"Rise.\" He comes forward himself, takes Juan's arm, guides him to stand. It's a gesture of respect, if not warmth. \"You ask how We fare. We shall tell you: We fare better this week than last. Do you know why?\" He doesn't wait for an answer. \"Because a king who completed the Reconquista has brought 600 knights to Rome and knelt before Us asking how he might serve the Church. This is... not nothing.\" He returns to his seat, gestures for Juan to take the chair opposite. Cardinal Capranica moves closer, listening. \"We have heard reports from Basel. We know of Como. We know you have tried to walk a middle path.\" A pause. \"Middle paths are treacherous, beloved son. They satisfy no one and anger everyone. Tell Us—do you still believe such a path is possible? Or has Basel taught you otherwise?\"\n\n71-85: Genuine Engagement\nSomething shifts in Eugenius's face when Juan asks about how he might help. The wariness doesn't disappear, but it recedes. \"You are the first monarch in three years to ask that question without immediately following it with demands.\" He rises from his chair, moves to the window, looks out over Rome. \"How have We fared? Poorly, if We are honest. The Council presses. The Camera bleeds. The Colonna watch for weakness. And France—\" He stops himself, shakes his head. \"But you did not come to hear an inventory of Our troubles.\" He turns back. \"You came from Basel. You signed Como with the Emperor. You have seen both sides of this war that is not yet a war.\" His voice is quieter now. \"What did you see, King Juan? Not what you said in speeches—what did you see? Because We have been trapped in Rome, and We need eyes We can trust.\"\n\n86-95: Unexpected Warmth\nEugenius rises from his chair as Juan kneels—rises and comes forward, taking Juan's hands in both of his own, raising him up. The gesture is almost paternal. \"Enough. Enough kneeling.\" His voice is rougher than expected, emotional. \"Do you know how long it has been since a Christian king came to Us without an outstretched hand? Without demands disguised as petitions?\" He leads Juan to the window, away from the secretary with his quill, away from even Capranica. His voice drops. \"You ask how We fare. We fare as a man who has watched his authority questioned, his treasury emptied, his allies drift away one by one. We fare as a man who prays each night for a sign that God has not abandoned His Church.\" He looks at Juan directly. \"And then you arrive. With your knights. With your completed crusade. Asking how you might help.\" A pause. \"Perhaps you are the sign. Perhaps not. But We will hear you, King Juan. Truly hear you. What would you have Us know?\"\n\n96-100: Providence Recognized\nEugenius's reaction is immediate and unexpected. As Juan kneels, the Pope rises—but instead of extending the ring, he comes forward, places his hands on Juan's shoulders, and raises him bodily. His eyes are bright with something that might be tears. \"We watched you.\" His voice is barely above a whisper. \"From Our window. Three days ago. You and your knights, walking to St. Peter's. Unarmed. Carrying the cross.\" He grips Juan's shoulders. \"Do you know what We thought? We thought: this is what the Church was meant to be. Men of faith who act, not argue. Who kneel before God, not before committees.\" He releases Juan, steps back, composes himself with visible effort. Cardinal Capranica looks startled—this was not expected. \"You ask how We fare. We shall tell you everything. And then—\" His voice steadies. \"Then We shall ask what you need, beloved son. Because it is clear to Us now that God has sent you. The only question is what He intends Us to build together.\"\n\nShall I roll, or do you have a d100 ready?"

He wants to know if Juan still believes in the middle path or if Basel taught him otherwise.\n\nRemember the NPC rules:\n- NPC has their own agenda - Eugenius wants to understand Juan's loyalties before committing anything\n- NPC does not explain themselves - he won't reveal his full thinking\n- NPC does not help Juan without getting something first\n\nI need to write Eugenius's response and then STOP - let Juan respond.\n\nThe Vatican\nPrivate Audience Chamber\nMarch 22, 1434\n\nEugenius's expression softens—slightly. The deep-set eyes remain watchful, but the initial guardedness recedes a fraction.\n\n\"Rise.\"\n\nHe comes forward himself, takes Juan's arm with thin but steady fingers, guides him to stand. It's a gesture of respect, if not warmth. The Fisherman's Ring catches the light from the window.\n\n\"You ask how We fare.

It's placed facing the papal chair directly—a conversation between near-equals, not a supplicant before a throne. Cardinal Capranica shifts position, moving closer. The secretary's quill hovers over parchment.\n\n\"We have heard reports from Basel.\" Eugenius's voice is measured, careful. \"We know of Como. We know you signed declarations with the Emperor. We know you addressed the Council, that you spoke of reforms, that the Castilian delegation has become—\" he pauses, selecting the word, \"—influential among the moderate voices.\"\n\nA longer pause. Those deep-set eyes study Juan's face.\n\n\"We also know that you have tried to walk a middle path. Between Us and the Council. Between authority and reform. Between those who would make the Pope a figurehead and those who would make reform impossible.\"\n\nHe leans back slightly, fingers steepled.\n\n\"Middle paths are treacherous, beloved son. They satisfy no one and anger everyone. The French whisper that you are Rome's creature. Rome wonders if you have been seduced by Basel's promises.\" A thin smile, without warmth. \"You cannot serve two masters. Scripture is clear on this point.\"\n\nThe fire crackles. Outside, Rome's bells mark the hour.\n\n\"Tell Us—\" Eugenius's voice drops, more direct now, \"—do you still believe such a path is possible? Or has Basel taught you otherwise?\""

Each potential concession must be carefully weighed against the risk of looking weak or being manipulated by the Basel Council.\n\nWhat does Eugenius want? To see if parallel legislation actually protects his authority or merely makes him a rubber stamp for Basel. To understand what Juan gets out of this arrangement. To not appear desperate even though he is.\n\nWhat won't he say? That he's already heard of parallel legislation and has been thinking about it. That the Camera's finances make reform concessions almost inevitable. That he fears appearing weak more than he fears the reforms themselves.\n\nThe Vatican\nPrivate Audience Chamber\n\nEugenius listens without interruption.

Instead: \"You propose that We sign decrees, enforce them across hostile territories, issue counter-decrees, flood Basel with delegates—a comprehensive campaign requiring years of effort and substantial resources.\" He pauses. \"And you have not yet mentioned what Castile receives in return.\" His voice sharpens. \"We have learned, beloved son, that gifts freely offered are never free. The Emperor offered mediation and produced Como—which bound Us to nothing and gave Basel legitimacy. Now you offer strategy. What is the price beneath the wrapping? Speak it plainly, or We shall assume the worst.\"\n\n21-35: Practical Objections\nEugenius tilts his head, considering. \"The logic is... not without merit. But you speak of enforcement as though it were simple.\" He raises a finger. \"Concubinage in France. Do you know how many French bishops keep women? How many cathedral chapters would resist? How many appeals would flood Rome, each requiring adjudication?\" A second finger. \"The Camera's finances. Enforcement requires investigators, tribunals, messengers, notaries. These cost money We do not have—particularly if We also sign the annates reform, which would reduce Our revenues by three-quarters.\" A third finger. \"And your counter-decree. What subject? Basel has addressed pluralism, concubinage, annates, elections. What remains that is both significant and uncontroversial?\" He spreads his hands. \"We do not reject your thinking. But We need more than principles. We need answers to these questions.\"\n\n36-50: Guarded Interest\nThe Pope is silent for a long moment. Cardinal Capranica shifts almost imperceptibly—something has registered. \"Enforce in France,\" Eugenius repeats slowly. \"Force the French to defer to Our judgment on a decree they themselves supported at Basel.\" His fingers tap the chair arm. \"There is... cunning in this. The Council cannot object to enforcement of their own legislation. The French cardinals here would be caught between their faction and their country.\" A pause. \"But cunning is not execution. France is not Castile. Their king does not kneel easily. Their clergy shelter behind the Pragmatic Sanction.\" He fixes Juan with a steady gaze. \"You completed the Reconquista. You know what enforcement truly costs—in gold, in blood, in years. Tell Us honestly: do you believe this can be done? And if so—\" his voice drops, \"—what role does Castile play in doing it?\"\n\n51-65: Serious Engagement\nEugenius leans forward. For the first time, genuine interest breaks through the diplomatic mask. \"A decree Rome passes that Basel has not addressed. Then pressure them to follow.\" He exchanges a glance with Cardinal Capranica—brief, significant. \"This inverts the dynamic. We lead, they follow—or they reveal themselves as obstructionists.\" He rises, moves to the window, speaks with his back turned. \"We have considered something similar. A decree on... but no. First, your strategy for enforcement. France is the critical test. The French faction here reports everything to Cardinal d'Allemand. If We move against French clergy, they will know within days. They will organize resistance.\" He turns back. \"How do you propose We overcome this? And—\" his eyes narrow slightly, \"—you still have not named your price, King Juan. We grow curious what you want from Us.\"\n\n66-80: Genuine Collaboration\nSomething shifts in the room. Eugenius glances at Capranica, who gives an almost imperceptible nod. When the Pope speaks, his voice has changed—less guarded, more direct. \"Sit forward, King Juan. We would speak plainly now.\" He leans toward Juan. \"Your strategy has merit. Real merit. The enforcement approach—using Basel's own decrees to demonstrate papal authority—this We had not considered so clearly. And the counter-decree...\" He pauses. \"We have a subject in mind. Constantinople. Basel passed their crusade decree in December, but it is vague on command, vague on duration, vague on authority. We could issue a complementary decree—specific, practical—and challenge Basel to match Our clarity.\" His eyes sharpen. \"But We need resources. Money. Political support. And someone to actually lead this expedition who can be trusted.\" He lets the implication hang. \"What does Castile need from Rome to make this work?\"\n\n81-90: Near Alliance\nEugenius rises and does something unexpected—he gestures for the secretary to stop writing. The quill lifts from parchment. Cardinal Capranica's eyebrows rise slightly. \"What We say now is between Us.\" The Pope moves closer, his voice dropping. \"Your strategy is sound. Better than sound—it is the first concrete path anyone has offered Us in three years of this crisis. Enforce Basel's own decrees, then lead with Our own initiative. Yes.\" He grips the arm of his chair. \"We have been waiting for someone who understands that this war is won through action, not argument. Granada proves you understand this.\" A pause, weighted. \"Tell Us what you need. Constantinople support—yes, obviously. What else? We are prepared to bargain seriously. But We must know your full position before We commit.\"\n\n91-100: Unexpected Openness\nEugenius holds up his hand, stopping Juan before he can say more. He turns to the secretary. \"Leave Us. You as well, Domenico—\" this to Capranica, who hesitates, then bows and withdraws. The door closes. The Pope and King are alone. Eugenius's entire demeanor changes—the diplomatic mask falls away, revealing exhaustion and something like desperate hope beneath. \"No more fencing. You have given Us the first workable strategy We have heard since this nightmare began. Enforcement through their own decrees. Counter-legislation to seize initiative. Flooding Basel with moderates until it withers.\" He sits heavily. \"We accept. In principle, We accept all of it. Now tell Us what you need—for Constantinople, for Castile, for yourself personally. Because you did not come here out of pure devotion to the Church, however genuine your faith may be. Name your price, King Juan. If it is within Our power, you shall have it.\"\n\nShall I roll, or do you have a d100 ready?"

He's been burned before and is deeply suspicious of gifts freely offered. He wants to know the price before he'll consider the proposal.\n\nThis is good - it follows the NPC rules. Eugenius has his own agenda (understanding what this costs him), he doesn't explain himself (doesn't reveal whether he thinks the strategy is good), and he won't help Juan without knowing what Juan wants first.\n\nLet me write this response staying true to the roll result.\n\nThe Vatican\nPrivate Audience Chamber\n\nEugenius listens.

Nothing that cost Sigismund anything.\"\n\nHe leans forward, those deep-set eyes fixed on Juan.\n\n\"Now you come. With knights. With letters. With strategies that sound reasonable and cost you nothing to propose. You speak of enforcing decrees in France—but Castilian swords will not march on Paris. You speak of flooding Basel with delegates—but Castile has already positioned itself as a moderate voice there, which serves your interests regardless of what We do.\"\n\nHis voice sharpens.\n\n\"What is the price beneath the wrapping, King Juan? What does Castile want that you have not yet named? Constantinople support? We expected that. What else? Naples recognition for your ally Alfonso? Permanent administration of your Military Orders? A cardinal's hat for someone in your household?\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"Speak it plainly. All of it.

          "text": "**What does Eugenius want?**\n- To believe Juan is genuine (he's desperate for true allies)\n- To NOT be made a fool by trusting another smooth talker\n- To find the catch - because there's always a catch\n- To protect himself from manipulation\n- To understand if this is real devotion or sophisticated politics\n\n**What won't he say?**\n- How much he wants to believe this\n- That he's moved by Juan's words but afraid to show it\n- That his own faith has been shaken by years of political warfare\n- That no one has spoken to him about the Church this way in years\n- That he suspects his own cynicism might be blinding him\n\n**The dilemma for Eugenius:**\nJuan's speech is either:\n1. Genuine faith from a rare king who actually believes - in which case Eugenius is being unfair and paranoid\n2. Sophisticated manipulation using religious language to disarm - in which case Eugenius is right to be suspicious\n3. Some mixture of both - genuine faith AND political calculation, which is how most medieval rulers actually operated\n\nEugenius has been burned before. He's also a genuinely religious man himself (he became Pope, after all). He's caught between wanting to believe and fearing to trust.\n\nThe French have been whispering warnings. The initial roll was 16 - suspicious probing. Eugenius pushed hard on \"what's your price?\" Juan responded with... no price. Just faith.\n\nThis could go several ways:\n- Eugenius could be moved but still cautious\n- Eugenius could become MORE suspicious (no price = hidden price)\n\n- Eugenius could test Juan further\n- Eugenius could begin to believe but need more evidence\n\nI recognize the delicate balance of skepticism and hope. The initial suspicious roll suggests Eugenius remains cautious, but Juan's heartfelt appeal has created a crack in his defensive wall. The lack of a concrete demand is intriguing - it challenges Eugenius's ingrained political instincts. His religious calling resonates with Juan's passionate speech, creating an internal tension between protective cynicism and genuine spiritual hope.\n\nConstantinople emerges as a critical emotional touchstone. Juan's unconditional commitment, demonstrated through actions like Granada, provides tangible evidence beyond mere rhetoric. The vivid imagery of church bells and farmers at Mass suggests an authenticity that penetrates Eugenius's hardened exterior. Yet, the papal advisor remains wary - political manipulation often disguises itself in religious language.\n\nThe internal struggle continues: trust versus historical betrayal, faith versus pragmatic suspicion. Each detail Juan presents both attracts and repels Eugenius's trust.\n\nNPC Analysis: Pope Eugenius IV\n\nWhat does Eugenius want?\n\nTo believe this is real—but he's been burned too many times\n\nTo find the hidden catch, because there's always a catch\n\nTo test whether Juan's faith is genuine or sophisticated rhetoric\n\nTo protect himself from appearing naive if this turns out to be manipulation\n\nTo understand why a king would truly want nothing\n\nWhat won't he say?\n\nThat Juan's words about church bells and confessions touched something in him\n\nThat no one has spoken to him about faith—not politics—in years\n\nThat his own faith has been corroded by endless political warfare\n\nHow desperately he wants to believe someone actually cares about the Church itself\n\nThat he's afraid his cynicism has made him unable to recognize genuine devotion\n\nD100: Pope Eugenius IV Responds to Juan's Declaration of Faith\n\nThe Situation: Eugenius demanded to know Juan's price. Juan responded with... no price. Just faith. An impassioned speech about church bells, confessions, the unity of Christendom. Either this is the rarest thing in politics—genuine selflessness—or it's the most sophisticated manipulation Eugenius has ever encountered. He cannot tell which.\n\nSuccess Factors\n\nJuan asked for nothing concrete—completely disarms the challenge\n\nThe imagery (church bells, farmers at Mass) is how a true believer talks\n\nJuan already pledged Constantinople aid unconditionally—actions before words\n\nGranada proves Juan acts on faith, not just speaks of it\n\nEugenius is himself a man of faith beneath the political armor\n\nThe speech resonates with why Eugenius became Pope in the first place\n\nFailure Factors\n\nEugenius has been burned repeatedly (Cesarini, Sigismund, countless others)\n\n\"I want nothing\" often means \"I'm hiding what I want\"\n\nThe French faction has specifically warned Eugenius about Juan\n\nThe more perfect the speech, the more suspicious it seems\n\nEugenius asked a direct question and received poetry—evasion?\n\nNo king is this selfless—medieval politics doesn't work this way\n\nPrior suspicion (roll of 16) creates momentum toward doubt\n\nThe Table\n\n1-10: Hardened Suspicion\nEugenius's face closes like a door. \"Church bells. Farmers at Mass. Confessions lifting souls to God.\" His voice is flat, reciting. \"Beautiful words, King Juan. We have heard beautiful words before. From Cardinal Cesarini, who wept when he spoke of Church unity—then sided with Basel. From the Emperor, who invoked Christ's name at Como—then gave Us nothing.\" He rises abruptly. \"You say you want nothing. You say the Church's strength is reward enough. Do you know what We hear? We hear a man who refuses to name his price because naming it would reveal its size.\" He moves to the window, back turned. \"This audience is not over. But We require time to consider what you have said—and what you have not said. Cardinal Capranica will show you to an antechamber. We will summon you when We are ready to continue.\" The dismissal is clear. Eugenius does not turn around.\n\n11-20: Cold Testing\n\"You seek nothing.\" Eugenius repeats the words without inflection. \"No monetary support. No positions. No recognition of claims. Only the joy of church bells ringing across Christendom.\" A pause. \"Forgive Us, King Juan, but We have occupied Peter's throne for three years. In that time, every cardinal, every ambassador, every king and duke and count who has knelt before Us has wanted something. Every one.\" His eyes are hard. \"You completed the Reconquista—a great deed. You bring knights to fight for Constantinople—admirable. But you are also heir presumptive to Aragón. Your ally Alfonso seeks Naples. Your Military Orders petition for permanent royal administration. Your kingdom's trade requires Mediterranean access.\" He spreads his hands. \"These are not accusations. These are realities. So when you speak of wanting only a strong Church... We wonder which of these realities you hope a strong Church will serve.\"\n\n21-35: Probing for Cracks\nEugenius is quiet for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice is softer—but no less searching. \"You speak of faith. Of church bells calling farmers to Mass. Of confessions and purpose and unity.\" A pause. \"We believe you mean these words. We do not believe they are the whole truth.\" He leans forward. \"You are a king, Juan of Castile. Kings do not travel a thousand miles, risk their fleets to storms, bring their pregnant wives to foreign cities, for abstractions. However genuine your faith—and We do not question it—there are concrete matters you wish to discuss. Constantinople. The Military Orders. Perhaps other things.\" His tone is not accusatory, but firm. \"We will hear your faith. We are moved by it. But We will also hear your necessities. Name them. All of them. Then We can speak as men who understand each other, not as a supplicant mouthing pieties and a Pope pretending to believe them.\"\n\n36-50: Grudging Recognition\nEugenius studies Juan for a long moment. Something flickers across his face—doubt, perhaps, warring with something else. \"You speak as a man of faith speaks. Not as diplomats speak, with their careful constructions and hidden meanings. We have heard enough diplomats to know the difference.\" He rises, moves slowly, as if weighing each step. \"We do not say We believe you entirely. We have learned that belief is a luxury Popes cannot afford. But We say this: if you are deceiving Us, you are the finest deceiver We have ever encountered. And if you are not...\" He trails off, turns to face Juan. \"The matters you wish to discuss—Constantinople, the reforms, whatever else—We will hear them. But first, answer Us one thing more. You say you cannot defeat the Ottomans alone. You say Christendom must unite. How? With what force? France will not march. England is consumed by its own wars. The Germans squabble. Who, King Juan, do you imagine will answer this call?\"\n\n51-65: Cautious Thaw\nSilence. Eugenius's fingers tap the arm of his chair—once, twice, three times. Then they stop. \"We have been Pope for three years,\" he says quietly. \"In that time, We have heard many speak of the Church. Of reform. Of unity. Of the faith that binds Christendom together.\" A pause. \"They speak of these things to get what they want. The Church is a tool to them. A means to an end.\" He looks at Juan directly. \"You speak differently. We cannot yet say whether this is because you are different, or because you are more skilled than the others. But...\" He hesitates, as if the admission costs him. \"It has been a long time since anyone spoke to Us about church bells. About the simple grace of farmers gathering for Mass.\" His voice roughens slightly. \"We remember why We became a priest. Before politics. Before Basel. We remember.\" He straightens. \"Very well, King Juan. We will not demand you name a price. We will instead ask: what do you need from Us to make Constantinople possible? Not as payment—as partnership.\"\n\n66-75: Moved but Guarded\nEugenius is silent for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice has changed—rougher, less controlled. \"Church bells.\" He repeats the words as if tasting them. \"Do you know how long it has been since someone spoke to Us of church bells? Of the simple faith of farmers gathering for Mass?\" He rises, but not in dismissal—in restlessness. \"We are surrounded by men who speak of the Church as a political institution. Revenues. Authority. Jurisdictions. Even the reformers at Basel—they speak of structures, of laws, of who holds power over whom.\" He turns to face Juan. \"You speak of something else. Of why the Church exists at all.\" A pause. \"We want to believe you, King Juan. God help Us, We want to believe someone still cares about the Church itself and not just what it can provide.\" His jaw tightens. \"But wanting to believe is dangerous. Tell Us of Constantinople. Of what you need. Let Us see if your actions align with your words.\"\n\n76-85: Beginning to Trust\nSomething shifts in Eugenius's expression. The wariness doesn't disappear, but beneath it—something older. Something that might be recognition. \"You speak of Castile owing its existence to Christianity. Of crusades giving your fathers purpose.\" His voice is quieter now. \"We understand this. We came from Venice—a city of merchants who weigh everything in ducats. We became a priest because We believed the Church was more than an institution. More than politics. More than power.\" He sits heavily. \"We have almost forgotten that belief, King Juan. Three years of Basel. Three years of being told We are a tyrant, or a figurehead, or an obstacle to reform. Three years of men who speak of the Church only to tear pieces from her.\" He looks at Juan with something approaching vulnerability. \"If you are what you claim to be—a king who fights for the Church because he loves her—then you are the ally We have prayed for. If you are not...\" He shakes his head. \"We will trust you. Provisionally. Tell Us what you need for Constantinople. Tell Us what the Church can do. And We will see if this trust is warranted.\"\n\n86-95: Genuine Connection\nEugenius rises from his chair. He waves a hand at Cardinal Capranica without looking at him. \"Domenico. Leave Us.\" The cardinal hesitates. \"Now.\" Capranica bows and withdraws. The secretary follows without being told. The door closes. Eugenius moves closer to Juan, his voice dropping. \"We are going to say something We have not said to anyone. Not to Our cardinals. Not to Our confessors.\" A pause. \"We have been losing Our faith.\" The words seem to cost him physical pain. \"Not in God. In the Church. In whether she can be saved. Whether she is worth saving. Basel calls Us corrupt. Perhaps they are right. The Camera is empty. The cardinals scheme. Rome itself is held together with prayers and threats.\" He grips Juan's arm. \"And then you come. Speaking of church bells. Of farmers at Mass. Of why any of this matters.\" His eyes are bright. \"We do not know if you are the answer to Our prayers or the most dangerous man We have ever met. But We know We must find out. Tell Us everything, King Juan. Constantinople, the Ottomans, what you truly need. We are listening—not as Pope to supplicant, but as one Christian to another.\"\n\n96-100: The Mask Falls\nEugenius makes a sound—half laugh, half something else. He turns away, moves to the window, and for a long moment says nothing. When he speaks, his voice is thick. \"Twenty-three years ago, We stood in a church in Venice. A small church. Poor. The priest was old, barely able to lift the host. The congregation was fishermen and their wives. And We knew—knew—that God was present. That the Church was holy. That nothing else mattered.\" He turns back, and his eyes are wet. \"We have not felt that certainty since We became Pope. Politics has poisoned everything. Every word, every gesture, every alliance—all of it calculated, weighed, measured against advantage.\" He crosses to Juan, takes his hands in both of his own. \"You speak of church bells, and We remember that church in Venice. You speak of farmers at Mass, and We remember why We gave Our life to Christ.\" His grip tightens. \"We do not care anymore what you want in return. If this is manipulation, then let Us be manipulated for a worthy cause. Tell Us how to save Constantinople. Tell Us how to save the Church. We will give you whatever you need. Just—\" His voice breaks. \"Just help Us remember why any of this matters.\"\n\nShall I roll, or do you have a d100 ready?"

He's still asking Juan to \"tell Us everything\" - he wants information, he wants partnership, he wants to understand what Juan truly needs. So he's not simply capitulating; he's opening a door and waiting to see what Juan brings through it.\n\nThe Vatican\nPrivate Audience Chamber\n\nEugenius rises from his chair.\n\nFor a moment he simply stands there, looking at Juan. Then he turns—not to the window, but to Cardinal Capranica.\n\n\"Domenico. Leave Us.\"\n\nCapranica's eyebrows rise. \"Holy Father—\"\n\n\"Now.\"\n\nThe cardinal hesitates only a moment longer.

Whether she is worth saving.\" His voice roughens. \"Basel calls Us corrupt. Perhaps they are right. The Camera is empty. The cardinals scheme—even the loyal ones scheme, they simply scheme in Our favor. Rome itself is held together with prayers and threats and the memory of what it once meant.\"\n\nHe begins to pace—short, restless movements, a man who has been still too long.\n\n\"For three years We have been told that We are a tyrant. An obstacle to reform. That the Church would flourish if only We would yield, or abdicate, or die. For three years We have defended the authority of Peter's throne, and We no longer remember if We defend it because it is sacred or because surrendering would mean admitting they were right about Us.\"\n\nHe stops. Turns to face Juan.\n\n\"And then you come.\"\n\nHis eyes are bright—not with tears, not quite, but with something close to it. The exhaustion of a man who has been holding walls alone.\n\n\"Speaking of church bells. Of farmers gathering for Mass. Of confessions and purpose and the joy of knowing God is praised across the land.\" His voice catches. \"Do you know how long it has been since anyone spoke to Us of why the Church exists? Everyone speaks of what she controls. What she costs. What she forbids. No one speaks of what she gives.\"\n\nHe grips Juan's arm—not as Pope to supplicant, but as a man reaching for something solid in dark water.\n\n\"We do not know if you are the answer to Our prayers or the most dangerous man We have ever met. We do not know if this is Providence or the most sophisticated manipulation ever attempted against the Holy See.\"\n\nHis grip tightens.\n\n\"We do not care.\"\n\nA breath.

The mask of the papacy lies somewhere on the floor between them, and the man beneath stands exposed.\n\n\"Help Us remember, Juan of Castile. Help Us believe the Church is worth saving.

Juan argues the Church is holy but men sin, and proposes reforming the Camera to address the real source of financial hemorrhaging. Eugenius admits he does not fully know where Camera money goes, that he signed 'temporary transfer' documents authorizing raids on funds including possibly Juan's crusade treasury of 315,500 florins. Juan challenges him: the Camera and corrupt cardinals are the real enemy, not Basel or reformers. Eugenius agonizes but agrees. Roll 80 (Growing Resolve): Eugenius calls himself a coward for three years of inaction, asks Juan to teach him how to 'bring down the hammer.' He requests Castile's backing, not soldiers in Rome but the shadow of strength, so that powerful men who move against the Pope know they move against Castile as well. Juan pledges all the crowns he commands without reservation.",

We fear sometimes before we remember that stepping forward into the light is scary because it exposes us, shows everyone we are not perfect.

But this is not true.\n\n\nI would say we should sign all decrees passed by Basel and one of our own as well. And start enforcing them immediately. The scism must have drained the coffers of the camera, we should immediately start collecting again. I have no access to the camera itself, but I suspect that a decree properly enforced could actually increase the amount of income the camera recieves.\n\n\nWe can unify the church like never before father. I know your heart wants genuine reform as well. Those using the Basel council to advance their own position are the real enemy and they are already isolated in Basel. Imagine every corner of Christendom listening to your authority, paying their dues. Papal legates who can enforce policy everywhere. A church creating stability and good law everywhere.

He should be:\n- Open and trusting\n- Willing to collaborate\n- But still raising real questions\n- Still being a partner, not a yes-man\n\nLet me think about what Eugenius wants at this moment:\n\nEugenius seeks genuine understanding and a collaborative approach. He yearns for a solution that addresses his deep institutional concerns while maintaining the emotional connection. His internal struggle balances hope with pragmatic caution, wanting to believe in Juan's vision but needing concrete assurances that protect the Church's interests.\n\nThe Vatican\nPrivate Audience Chamber\n\nEugenius listens. The vulnerability doesn't leave his face, but something else joins it—a sharpening of attention, the Pope emerging alongside the man.\n\nWhen Juan finishes, Eugenius moves to his chair but doesn't sit. His hands rest on its back, gripping the carved wood.\n\n\"The Church is holy. Only men sin.\" He repeats the words slowly. \"Yes. Yes. We knew this once. Before We became the man everyone sins against and everyone blames for sin.\"\n\nHe releases the chair, turns to face Juan fully.\n\n\"You speak of signing all Basel's decrees. Enforcing them. Collecting revenues. Unifying Christendom under papal authority.\" A pause. His voice is steadier now—still raw, but with purpose beneath it. \"We want this. God knows We want this. But We must speak of realities, even now.\"\n\nHe begins to pace again, but differently—thinking aloud, not restless.\n\n\"The annates decree. Basel reduced papal taxation by three-quarters. Three-quarters, Juan. The Camera is already bleeding. If We sign that decree and enforce it, We enforce Our own impoverishment.\" He holds up a hand before Juan can respond. \"We are not saying We refuse. We are saying We must understand how enforcement increases revenue when the decree itself decreases what We may collect.\"\n\nHe stops pacing.\n\n\"And France. You speak of papal legates enforcing policy everywhere. The French have their Gallican traditions—they already treat Our authority as advisory. Their bishops shelter behind royal protection. If We send legates to enforce concubinage decrees against French clergy, the French crown will expel them. What then?\"\n\nHis eyes meet Juan's—not suspicious now, but searching. Wanting answers.\n\n\"We believe you, Juan of Castile. We believe you want what you say you want. But belief alone does not fill treasuries or move armies or make French kings kneel.\"\n\nHe moves closer.\n\n\"Help Us understand how. How does enforcement increase revenue? How do We compel France without the power to compel? How do We sign Basel's decrees without appearing to surrender to Basel?\"\n\nA pause. When he speaks again, his voice is quieter.\n\n\"We are asking as a partner now. Not testing you. Not doubting you. Simply... asking. Because We have dreamed of this unified Church you describe, and We need to know if it can be more than a dream.\""

However, we're in 1434, so this hasn't happened yet! \n\nBut wait - there were earlier French assertions of Gallican liberties. The concept of French ecclesiastical independence from Rome predates 1438. There were tensions throughout the medieval period about papal authority in France.\n\nActually, I need to be careful here. The Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges was specifically issued in 1438, adopting many of the Council of Basel's decrees. In 1434, it doesn't exist yet.\n\nHowever, there were earlier precedents:\n- Philip IV's conflicts with Boniface VIII in the early 1300s\n- Various assertions of Gallican liberties\n- French clergy's resistance to papal taxation during the Avignon period and after\n\nSo Eugenius mentioning a \"Pragmatic Sanction\" in 1434 is anachronistic. He should be talking about French Gallican traditions and resistance to papal authority more generally, not a specific document that doesn't exist yet.\n\nLet me reconsider. The Pope should explain the practical obstacles France presents:\n1. French crown's traditional assertion of control over French clergy\n2. French bishops' resistance to Roman taxation\n3. The practical difficulty of enforcing anything in France without French royal cooperation\n4. The distance and logistics\n5. French faction at Basel aligned with Cardinal d'Allemand (Louis Aleman, Archbishop of Arles - who is French)\n\nActually, I should have Eugenius explain the French situation without referencing the Pragmatic Sanction specifically, since that document is from 1438. Or I could have him refer to earlier Gallican traditions and assertions.\n \nEugenius recognizes the shifting dynamics between them. Initially suspicious, he's now genuinely interested in collaboration. The NPC's agenda has transformed from guarded resistance to a more open, problem-solving approach. His questions reflect a sincere desire to understand and work together, moving beyond initial barriers of mistrust.\n\nI'll explore the complex French ecclesiastical landscape, highlighting their deep-rooted resistance to papal directives. The challenge isn't just about a single document, but a long-standing cultural and political tradition of clerical independence. Royal control and Gallican practices create significant obstacles for papal enforcement, making any universal mandate practically unworkable.\n\nThe Vatican\nPrivate Audience Chamber\n\nEugenius pauses. The question is direct—practical—and it catches him slightly off-guard. He moves to his chair now, sitting, gathering his thoughts.\n\n\"The French have long claimed what they call libertés gallicanes—Gallican liberties. The principle that the French church governs itself in temporal matters, that royal authority shields French clergy from Roman jurisdiction.\" He waves a hand. \"It is not one document. It is a tradition. A habit of defiance dressed in legal language.\"\n\nHe leans forward, fingers pressed together.\n\n\"In practice: when Rome demands payment from a French bishop, he appeals to his archbishop. The archbishop defers to the crown. The crown declares that French clergy pay taxes to the French king, not to foreign powers—and yes, they call Rome a foreign power when it suits them.\" Bitterness creeps into his voice. \"They tithe their own clergy readily enough. But papal collectors? They are delayed. Obstructed. Sometimes simply... not admitted.\"\n\nHe rises again, restless energy returning.\n\n\"The Avignon years made it worse. When the papacy sat in France, French kings grew accustomed to a Pope they could influence. Now that we have returned to Rome, they resent paying for a Church they cannot control.\" He turns to face Juan. \"And Basel has given them new weapons. French cardinals—d'Allemand chief among them—argue that councils hold supreme authority. If councils are supreme, then papal taxation requires conciliar approval. Which France will ensure never comes.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"This is what We face. Not a single law We can challenge, but a culture of resistance. A king who benefits from keeping his clergy's gold in France. Bishops who prefer a distant Pope they can ignore to a present one who demands accountability.\"\n\nHis eyes meet Juan's.\n\n\"So tell Us, King of Castile—how do We collect from men who have spent a century learning not to pay?\""

The maintenance of the Papal States. The defense against Milan's condottieri. The salaries of the Curia—the secretaries, the notaries, the judges who hear appeals from across Christendom. The upkeep of St. Peter's. Charitable distributions. The papal household.\"\n\nA pause. His jaw tightens.\n\n\"We could also tell you the truth.\"\n\nHe looks up at Juan, and there is something like shame in his eyes.\n\n\"The truth is that We do not fully know.

Funds flow through channels established centuries ago, and when We have asked for accountings, We receive documents so complex that three clerks working for a month could not untangle them.\"\n\nHe rises, moves to the window, speaks with his back turned.\n\n\"What We do know: cardinals live in palaces. They keep households of dozens—servants, secretaries, guards, cooks. They host banquets. They patronize artists. They maintain... companions.\" The word is bitter. \"The Curia employs men whose positions were purchased, not earned—sinecures sold to fund some previous Pope's war or building project. And yes, there has been excess. There has been sin.\"\n\nHe turns back.\n\n\"You ask what France receives in return for its payments. The honest answer? Less than they should. They send gold to Rome, and Rome sends back... what? Bureaucratic delays. Dispensations that cost additional fees. Legates who demand hospitality and deliver lectures.\"\n\nHis voice drops.\n\n\"This is why Basel's critique has power, Juan. Not because they are right about councils being supreme—they are not.

There's a very real possibility that the crusade treasury has been... borrowed from.

Let me think about the d100 table carefully.\n\nThe question is essentially: how does Eugenius react to Juan's proposal to audit the crusade treasury?\n\nThis is a high-stakes moment. Juan has cornered Eugenius - but in a way that could be collaborative (let's find out together and fix it) or accusatory (let's expose your corruption).\n\nThe previous roll was 93 - which established genuine trust and vulnerability. But now Juan is proposing something that could be deeply embarrassing for Eugenius.\n\nI'll craft a nuanced response that captures the delicate diplomatic dance between Juan and Eugenius. The d100 table will reflect the complex emotional and political dynamics at play, balancing Eugenius's fear of exposure with his genuine desire for reform.\n\nThe Vatican\nPrivate Audience Chamber\n\nEugenius goes pale.\n\nNot dramatically—not the theatrical shock of a man performing surprise. This is quieter. The color simply drains from his face, leaving it grey and drawn in the afternoon light.\n\nHe does not answer immediately.\n\nInstead, he moves to the window. Stands there. His back is to Juan, his shoulders rigid beneath the white robes. When he speaks, his voice is carefully controlled.\n\n\"Three hundred and fifteen thousand florins. With complete accounting. Forty-seven pages documenting every expense of your Reconquista, every coin remaining.\" A pause. \"We remember. We were... moved by the gesture. A king who returns a treasury instead of keeping it. Who provides accounting instead of excuses.\"\n\nHis hands clasp behind his back.\n\n\"You ask if the Camera has kept it locked away. If every penny remains intact, waiting for the crusade it was meant to fund.\"\n\nSilence stretches.\n\n\"We do not know.\"\n\nThe admission comes out flat. Dead.\n\n\"We gave instructions. The treasury was to be held separately. Sacred funds for sacred purpose. But the Camera...\" He turns now, and his face is haunted. \"Three years of crisis, Juan. Milan's armies threatening the Papal States. The Colonna demanding payment to keep peace in Rome itself. Basel draining Our authority and with it Our ability to collect. The cardinals requiring their... maintenance.\"\n\nHe moves to his chair but does not sit. His hands grip the back of it, knuckles white.\n\n\"We signed documents. Many documents. Authorizations for 'temporary transfers' to meet 'immediate needs' with 'full repayment upon resolution of current difficulties.'\" His voice is bitter. \"We told Ourselves it was necessary. That the crusade funds would be restored. That God would understand.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan directly.\n\n\"We do not know if your treasury is intact. We do not know how much remains. We have been afraid to ask.\"\n\nThe Pope of Rome stands before the King of Castile, and in his eyes is the terror of a man who suspects he has stolen from God.\n\n\"You propose we ask the Camera now.

He releases the chair and steps back—physically retreating. \"You speak of bringing down the hammer. Of forging the Church anew.\" His voice trembles. \"Do you know what you are proposing? The men who control the Camera—they are not clerks, Juan. They are cardinals. Families who have held power in Rome for generations. The Colonna. The Orsini. Men who made Popes and unmade them before We were born.\" He shakes his head rapidly. \"We cannot. We cannot. They would destroy Us. Not through Basel—through knives in the dark, through poison, through a convenient fever that claims Us in Our sleep.\" He backs toward the door. \"We should not have spoken so freely. We should not have admitted—\" He stops, collects himself with visible effort. \"We thank you for your counsel, King Juan. We must... We must pray on these matters. This audience is concluded.\"\n\n11-20: Retreat to Safety\nEugenius is silent for a long moment. When he speaks, the vulnerability has begun to close over—the Pope reassembling himself around the man. \"You offer to help Us reform the Camera. To bring down the hammer, as you say.\" His voice is careful now, measured. \"And what would Christendom see? A Pope so weak he requires a foreign king to discipline his own household. A Pope who cannot manage his own treasury without Castilian oversight.\" He straightens. \"We are grateful for your faith in Us, King Juan. Truly. But there are things a Pope must do alone, or not at all. The Camera is Our responsibility. Our burden. Our sin to confess and Our mess to clean.\" He moves toward his chair, sits with recovered dignity. \"Let Us speak instead of Constantinople. Of the reforms. Of matters where Castile's strength can aid the Church without... complications.\"\n\n21-35: Fearful Hesitation\n\"Reform the Camera.\" Eugenius repeats the words as if testing their weight. \"Together.\" He sinks into his chair, suddenly looking older. \"You make it sound simple. Pull them into the light. Find out what is really happening. Forge the Church anew.\" A long pause. \"Do you know how many men have tried to reform the Curia, King Juan? How many have been destroyed by it? The Camera is not a treasury—it is a web. Every thread connects to powerful men who will fight to preserve their place in it.\" His hands grip the chair arms. \"We want what you describe. God knows We want it. But We are not... We have never been...\" He struggles for words. \"We survived Avignon. We survived the Schism. We survived by knowing when to bend, when to wait, when to let storms pass. What you propose is not waiting. It is war.\" His eyes meet Juan's, and there is fear in them. \"We do not know if We have the strength for war.\"\n\n36-50: Conflicted Interest\nEugenius rises, paces to the window, paces back. His movements are agitated, a man wrestling with himself. \"You have done this before, you say. In Castile. Brought down the hammer on corruption. Reformed your treasury.\" He stops, faces Juan. \"And what did it cost you? How many enemies did you make? How many men who once supported you became obstacles?\" He doesn't wait for an answer. \"We have so few allies already. Basel presses from without. The Colonna threaten from within. The French whisper against Us in every court. If We now turn on the very cardinals who have remained loyal—even if their loyalty is purchased with Camera funds—what then?\" He spreads his hands. \"We are not saying no. We are saying... We need to understand what We would be choosing. And what We would be sacrificing. Walk Us through it, King Juan. Not principles—specifics. How did you reform Castile's treasury? What did it actually require?\"\n\n51-65: Cautious Acceptance\nEugenius is quiet for a long time. He moves to the window, looks out over Rome, and when he speaks, his voice is distant. \"When We were young—before We became what We are now—We had a confessor. An old Augustinian. He told Us once that every man faces a moment when God asks him to choose between comfort and righteousness. Most men, he said, choose comfort and tell themselves they are being prudent.\" He turns back to Juan. \"We have been prudent for three years. We have survived. And the Church has rotted around Us while We survived.\" A long breath. \"Perhaps it is time to stop being prudent.\" He returns to his chair, sits, and something has changed in his bearing—not confidence exactly, but resolution. \"We cannot do this alone. We know that now. If you are offering to help Us—truly help Us, not merely advise from a safe distance—then We accept. But We must know: what does 'bringing down the hammer' actually look like? Where do we begin?\"\n\n66-80: Growing Resolve\nSomething shifts in Eugenius's expression. The fear doesn't disappear, but it is joined by something else—anger, perhaps, long suppressed. \"You say we already know the answer. That the Camera has been bleeding money. That men have been profiting.\" His voice hardens. \"Yes. We know. We have known for years. We have told Ourselves We were too weak to act, too threatened from without to risk enemies within.\" He stands straighter. \"Perhaps We have been a coward, Juan of Castile. Perhaps survival has become an excuse for abdication.\" He moves closer. \"You completed the Reconquista. You reformed your treasury. You did not wait for perfect conditions—you acted.\" His eyes are brighter now, not with tears but with something fiercer. \"Teach Us. Show Us how you brought down the hammer in Castile. We will need allies in the Curia—there are honest men, a few—and We will need protection from the consequences. Can Castile provide this? Not soldiers in Rome, but... backing. The knowledge that if they move against Us, they move against you as well.\"\n\n81-90: Embracing the Challenge\nEugenius laughs—a strange sound, sharp and sudden, surprising even himself. \"Bring down the hammer. Reform the Camera. Pull the corruption into the light.\" He shakes his head, but he is almost smiling. \"Do you know, We have dreamed of this? In the darkest hours, when We could not sleep for shame, We have imagined standing before the Curia and demanding an accounting. Watching the guilty squirm. Cleaning the rot from Peter's house.\" His expression sobers. \"We always told Ourselves it was impossible. That We were too weak, too threatened, too alone.\" He looks at Juan directly. \"We are still weak. Still threatened. But perhaps no longer alone.\" He extends his hand—not for the ring to be kissed, but to clasp Juan's arm as an equal. \"Help Us do this, Juan of Castile. Help Us become the Pope We should have been from the beginning. We will need your counsel, your experience, your strength. And yes—We will need the knowledge that Castile stands with Us when the powerful men of the Curia realize what We intend.\"\n\n91-100: Transformation\nEugenius closes his eyes. For a long moment he stands motionless, and Juan cannot tell if he is praying or simply gathering himself. When he opens his eyes, something has changed. The fear is still there—but beneath it, rising through it, is something that looks almost like joy. \"You speak of bringing down the hammer as gracious and beautiful work. As giving purpose.\" His voice is thick. \"We had forgotten that reform could be joyful. That cleaning corruption could be an act of worship, not just punishment.\" He moves to Juan, takes both his hands. \"Three years We have been Pope. Three years of defense, of survival, of watching the Church crumble while We told Ourselves We were preserving what remained. You offer Us something different. Something We did not dare to hope for.\" His grip tightens. \"We accept. Not reluctantly—gratefully. Help Us reform the Camera. Help Us discover where the money has gone, who has taken it, how to stop the bleeding. And yes, help Us find out what remains of your crusade treasury—even if the answer damns Us.\" He releases Juan's hands but holds his gaze. \"We will need to move carefully. There are men who will kill to preserve their corruption. But We will move. Together. In the image of our Lord, as you say.\" A pause, and something like wonder crosses his face. \"We had forgotten what hope feels like, Juan of Castile. We thank you for reminding Us.\"\n\nShall I roll, or do you have a d100 ready?"

But it is joined now by something else. Something older and harder. Anger, perhaps. Long suppressed, finally finding its voice.\n\n\"You say we already know the answer. That the Camera has been bleeding money. That men have been profiting while the Church withers.\"\n\nHis voice has changed. Lower. Rougher.\n\n\"Yes. We know. We have known, Juan of Castile. For three years We have known. We have watched cardinals build palaces while parishes crumble. We have signed 'temporary transfer' documents and pretended not to understand what they truly meant. We have told Ourselves We were too weak to act, too threatened from without to risk making enemies within.\"\n\nHe rises from his chair. Not with the careful movements of an exhausted man now—with something sharper.\n\n\"Perhaps We have been a coward.\"\n\nThe word hangs in the air. A Pope calling himself a coward in front of a foreign king.\n\n\"Perhaps survival has become an excuse for abdication. Perhaps We have confused prudence with paralysis.\" He moves closer to Juan, his deep-set eyes burning with something that might be shame transformed into resolve. \"You completed the Reconquista. Seven centuries of work finished in two years. You reformed your treasury—you say you have done this before. You did not wait for perfect conditions. You did not tell yourself the time was not right. You acted.\"\n\nHe stops an arm's length from Juan.\n\n\"Teach Us.\"\n\nThe words come out like a confession.\n\n\"Show Us how you brought down the hammer in Castile. We are not... We have never been a man of action. We survived Avignon. We survived the Schism. We survived by bending, by waiting, by letting storms pass over Us. But you—\" He gestures at Juan. \"You do not wait for storms to pass. You ride into them.\"\n\nHis voice drops.\n\n\"We will need allies. There are honest men in the Curia—a few. Cardinals who have watched the corruption and despaired as We have despaired. We will need to find them, cultivate them, bring them into this... this hammer of yours.\" He pauses. \"And We will need protection.\"\n\nHis eyes search Juan's face.\n\n\"Not soldiers in Rome. That would destroy Us faster than the corruption ever could. But backing. The knowledge—spread quietly through the right channels—that if certain powerful men move against Us, they move against Castile as well. Against the king who completed the Reconquista. Against 600 knights who could become 6,000 if provoked.\"\n\nHe reaches out, grips Juan's arm.\n\n\"Can you give Us this? Not troops, not gold—just the shadow of strength behind Us. The suggestion that destroying this Pope would be... costly.\""

      "summary": "Juan and Eugenius plan the practical mechanics of Camera reform. Eugenius reveals the Vatican's security vulnerabilities: the Papal Guard (200 men) under Captain Giacomo Pallavicini is probably loyal, but most household servants predate his papacy and some report to cardinals. Camera officials were not appointed by him and serve the institution's entrenched interests. Juan proposes a comprehensive strategy: write the reform decree in secret, announce it publicly under motu proprio, simultaneously sign Basel's reforms on pluralism, concubinage, and annates to demonstrate papal leadership, request Basel affirm the Camera reform decree in return, send correspondence to Christian monarchs (Castile, Aragon, Naples, Portugal, the Empire) for support, then replace Castilian knights with vetted Italian loyal soldiers. Eugenius raises concerns about the annates reform cutting 75% of Camera revenue, but Juan argues the problem is expenditure not revenue, as corrupt cardinals will consume any amount. Juan proposes a clean slate: no investigations into past sins, simply end all old arrangements and rebuild papal finances from scratch, with half of income to the papal residence and half to cardinals for their dioceses. Eugenius accepts the logic but raises the question of Juan's crusade treasury. Juan forgives any losses, citing Jesus's teaching to turn the other cheek.",

          "text": "What won't he say?\n- The names of specific cardinals he suspects (not yet - too dangerous)\n- How deep his own complicity runs with the \"temporary transfers\"\n- That this reframing terrifies him because these enemies are closer and more dangerous than Basel\n- That some of the corrupt cardinals are the same ones who elected him Pope\n\nThis is a pivotal moment. Juan is essentially asking Eugenius to commit to a fundamental reframing of the Church's crisis. The previous roll was 80 - showing growing resolve. Now Juan is pushing him to crystallize that resolve into a specific identification of the enemy.\n\nI should not use a d100 table here. This is a moment for Eugenius to respond directly to a clarifying question. The high previous roll (80) established his growing resolve. Now he must answer Juan's direct question: are the Camera and corrupt cardinals the real enemy?\n\nLet me write Eugenius grappling with this question - not refusing it, but wrestling with its implications before answering.\n\nThe Vatican\nPrivate Audience Chamber\n\nEugenius is still.\n\nJuan's question hangs in the air between them—simple, direct, and devastating in its implications. The Pope's grip on Juan's arm loosens. He steps back, turns away, moves to the window. For a long moment he stands there, silhouetted against the pale March light, his thin shoulders rigid beneath the white robes.\n\nWhen he speaks, his voice is barely above a whisper.\n\n\"You ask Us to say it plainly. To name the enemy.\"\n\nA long breath.\n\n\"For three years We have told Ourselves the enemy was Basel. The Council. The conciliarists who would reduce the Pope to a figurehead. We have fought them. Resisted them. Spent every waking hour defending papal authority against their attacks.\" He turns, and his face is haunted. \"And all the while, the true rot was here. In Rome. In the Camera. In Our own household.\"\n\nHe moves back toward Juan, slowly, as if each step costs him something.\n\n\"The reformers at Basel—most of them—they do not hate the Church. They hate what the Church has become. They see cardinals living like princes while parishes lack priests. They see fees and taxes flowing to Rome and disappearing into... what? Banquets. Palaces. Courtesans.\" His voice cracks slightly. \"They are not wrong to be angry. Their solution is wrong—councils cannot govern the Church—but their anger is righteous.\"\n\nHe stops before Juan.\n\n\"You ask if the Camera and corrupt cardinals are the real enemy.\" A pause. His jaw tightens. \"Yes. God help Us, yes. The men who have turned Peter's treasury into their personal wealth. The families who have treated the Curia as their inheritance. The officials who have made the Church's finances so opaque that even the Pope cannot trace where the money flows.\"\n\nHis voice drops lower.\n\n\"Some of them elected Us. Some of them kept Us alive when the Colonna threatened. Some of them We have called friends.\" He meets Juan's eyes. \"They will not surrender their corruption quietly. They will fight. They will call Us ungrateful, or mad, or controlled by foreign powers. They will whisper to Basel that We have become a tyrant. They will whisper to France that Castile has purchased the papacy.\"\n\nA long silence.\n\n\"But yes. They are the enemy. The true enemy. And We have been too blind—or too frightened—to see it until you forced Us to speak it aloud.\"\n\nHe grips Juan's arm again, and there is something desperate in it.\n\n\"You pledge Castile's crowns in Our defense. You speak of Sigismund feeling the same. But tell Us truly, Juan of Castile—\" His voice is raw. \"When the hammer falls, when the powerful men of the Curia realize what We intend, when they begin their counterattack... will you still stand with Us? Even if they make it costly? Even if they turn all of Europe against the Pope who dared to clean his own house?\""

Juan is essentially holding up a mirror and saying \"You're the Pope. Answer your own question.\"\n\nThis should be a moment of transformation for Eugenius - not because Juan convinced him with clever arguments, but because Juan forced him to confront his own faith.\n\nThe Vatican\nPrivate Audience Chamber\n\nEugenius freezes.\n\nThe question strikes him like a physical blow. His mouth opens, closes. His hand falls away from Juan's arm. He stands there, the Pope of Rome, the Vicar of Christ—and a king has just asked him what scripture teaches about fear.\n\nFor a long moment, he cannot speak.\n\nThen, slowly, he begins to laugh. Not joyful laughter—something rougher, more painful. The laughter of a man confronting his own absurdity.\n\n\"You ask Us—\" He shakes his head, the laughter fading into something raw. \"You ask the Pope what the Gospel preaches. What Jesus would do.\" His voice breaks. \"We have spent three years hiding behind theology while forgetting the first lesson Christ ever taught.\"\n\nHe turns away, moves to the small altar in the corner of the chamber. A crucifix hangs there—simple, wooden, old. He stares at it.\n\n\"Be not afraid.\" The words come out hoarse. \"Three hundred and sixty-five times in scripture. One for every day of the year, the scholars say. As if God knew we would need constant reminding.\"\n\nHis hand reaches out, touches the foot of the cross.\n\n\"Fear not, for I am with you. I will strengthen you. I will help you.\" Isaiah. His voice steadies slightly. \"For God gave us not a spirit of fear, but of power and love and self-control.\"\n\nHe turns back to Juan, and there are tears on his face. He does not wipe them away.\n\n\"What would Jesus have done?\" A broken laugh. \"He walked into the Temple and overturned the tables of the money-changers. He did not ask permission. He did not wait for perfect conditions. He did not worry that the Pharisees would call Him dangerous or the Romans would take notice.\" His voice rises. \"He saw corruption in His Father's house, and He drove it out.\"\n\nHe moves back toward Juan, and something has changed in his bearing. The fear is still there—but it has been joined by something stronger.\n\n\"Any priest would tell Us what We already know. That faith without works is dead. That the shepherd who fears the wolf more than he loves the sheep is no shepherd at all. That—\" His voice catches. \"That We have been a coward, hiding behind prudence, while the Church We swore to protect has been devoured from within.\"\n\nHe stands before Juan now, close enough to touch.\n\n\"You did not come here to teach Us scripture, King of Castile. You came to make Us remember what We already knew and were too frightened to act upon.\"\n\nHe draws a long, shuddering breath.\n\n\"Very well. We remember now.\"\n\nHis chin lifts. His shoulders straighten. And when he speaks again, his voice carries something it has lacked for three years—conviction.\n\n\"We will bring down the hammer. We will reform the Camera. We will drag the corruption into the light, whatever the cost. If they kill Us for it, then We will die as a Pope should die—defending Christ's Church, not cowering while others plunder her.\"\n\nHe extends his hand—not for Juan to kiss, but to clasp.\n\n\"Will you help Us begin? Today? Now? Before Our courage fails Us again?\""

He's been a survivor - he should know the dangers of his own court.

This is realistic medieval politics.\n\nI don't need a d100 table for this - it's a practical question about their current situation that Eugenius should be able to answer based on his knowledge of his own court.

The fire in his eyes dims—not extinguished, but banked by sudden practical fear. He looks around the chamber as if seeing it for the first time. The tapestries on the walls. The door through which Capranica and the secretary departed. The windows overlooking Rome.\n\n\"Safe,\" he repeats quietly. His voice has changed again—still resolved, but tempered now with the survival instincts that have kept him alive this long.\n\nHe moves closer to Juan, drops his voice to barely above a whisper.\n\n\"This chamber is... reasonably secure. We use it for private audiences precisely because it has fewer servants' passages than the formal halls. But—\" He glances at the door. \"Cardinal Capranica heard much before We dismissed him. He is loyal, We believe. One of the few. But his household talks to other households. And the secretary...\"\n\nHis jaw tightens.\n\n\"The secretary is Camera-appointed. Not Ours.

The men who have profited will know before sunset. They have had decades to build their networks. We have had three years of... of not looking too closely.\"\n\nHe stops, faces Juan.\n\n\"Your knights. The 591 at their billets. How quickly could they reach the Vatican if summoned?\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"We do not ask because We intend violence. We ask because We need to know what options exist if...\" He trails off, unwilling to finish the sentence.\n\nHis eyes move to the door again.\n\n\"Capranica. We must speak with him. Carefully. He has argued for reform before—quietly, knowing We were not ready to hear it. If he can be trusted...\" Another pause. \"And there are others. Cardinal Albergati. Perhaps Bishop Parentucelli in the Curia. Men who have whispered their disgust to Us in private moments.\"\n\nHe looks back at Juan.\n\n\"But you are right to ask about security first. We have been a fool once today already—letting emotion carry Us forward without thought. Before We bring down any hammers, We must know who holds the handles of the ones that might fall on Us.\"\n\nHis voice drops lower still.\n\n\"What would you advise, King Juan?

Eugenius should answer them but also show some hesitation or concern about certain aspects - particularly about becoming too dependent on Juan's forces.\n\nLet me craft a response that:\n- Answers the practical questions (Eugenius would know these things)\n- Shows some concern about the optics/implications\n- Maintains his character as someone who has been cautious and political\n- Doesn't just roll over and agree to everything\n\nNPC Analysis: Pope Eugenius IV\n\nWhat does Eugenius want?\n\nTo ensure he maintains control of this process—not become Juan's puppet\n\nTo understand if this plan actually works legally and practically\n\nReassurance that he won't be seen as a foreign king's tool\n\nTo protect himself while appearing to lead\n\nWhat won't he say?\n\nThat Castilian knights swearing allegiance to him personally makes him nervous\n\nThat once Juan's men control the Camera, Juan effectively controls papal finances\n\nHis uncertainty about whether he can actually issue decrees without curial support\n\nThat some \"loyal\" cardinals may abandon him when the hammer actually falls\n\nHis fear that he's trading one form of dependence for another\n\nThe Vatican\nPrivate Audience Chamber\n\nEugenius listens carefully. When Juan finishes, he does not answer immediately. His eyes flicker—calculating, assessing. The survival instincts of three years have not entirely given way to newfound resolve.\n\n\"Secure the Camera building itself. Yes.\" He nods slowly. \"That is... cleaner. The documents remain where they are. We control access. No one enters or leaves without Our permission.\" A pause. \"The Camera offices are not large. Perhaps your knights could hold them with—fifty men? A hundred? Enough to guard every door and window, enough to prevent accidents with candles and parchment.\"\n\nHe moves to a small writing desk in the corner of the chamber, touches it absently.\n\n\"Your knights swearing allegiance to Our person.\" His voice is more careful now. Measured. \"This creates legitimacy, yes. They become servants of the Church, not a foreign army occupying the Vatican.\" He turns back to Juan. \"But it also creates... questions. Six hundred Castilian knights, sworn to the Pope, holding the Camera. Cardinal d'Allemand will say We have sold the papacy to Spain. The French will claim—\"\n\nHe stops himself. Shakes his head.\n\n\"No. You are right. We cannot let fear of what enemies will say prevent Us from acting. They will say what they will say regardless. Better to act righteously and be slandered than to cower and be despised.\"\n\nHe straightens, and something of the resolve returns.\n\n\"As for papal authority—\" He moves back toward Juan. \"This is... complex. In principle, the Pope's authority is supreme and immediate. We can issue decrees, bulls, constitutions by Our own hand. The keys of Peter are Ours. No council, no consistory, no cardinal can legally prevent Us from exercising Our office.\"\n\nHis expression darkens.\n\n\"In principle. In practice...\" He spreads his hands. \"Major decrees are traditionally discussed in consistory—the assembly of cardinals. Not because We require their permission, but because issuing significant legislation without consultation appears tyrannical. It gives ammunition to Basel's claims that We are an autocrat who ignores the counsel of the Church.\"\n\nHe pauses, thinking.\n\n\"However. There are precedents for urgent action. Motu proprio—by Our own initiative. When circumstances demand immediate response, the Pope may act alone and seek ratification afterward.\" His eyes meet Juan's. \"We could summon a scribe. We could issue a decree establishing a commission to audit the Camera's finances. We could do it now, this hour, with only you as witness.\"\n\nHe hesitates.\n\n\"But such a decree, issued in secret, acted upon by foreign knights before the cardinals even know it exists...\" He shakes his head slowly. \"The legality would be unquestionable. The legitimacy—in the eyes of Christendom—that is another matter. We would need to announce it publicly almost immediately. Explain why urgency required extraordinary measures. Frame it as reform, not seizure.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan directly.\n\n\"You spoke of giving a speech before thousands. Of dragging into light what was in darkness.\" A long pause. \"If We do this—secure the Camera tonight, issue the decree, present the world with accomplished fact—We will need to speak to Rome tomorrow. To the cardinals. To the people. We will need to explain Ourselves in a way that makes Us reformers, not tyrants.\"\n\nHis voice drops.\n\n\"We have never been a man for speeches, Juan of Castile. We have survived by being quiet, by being cautious, by letting others speak while We listened.\" Something flickers in his eyes—fear, but also something else. Challenge, perhaps. Or desperate hope.\n\n\"Will you help Us find the words?\""

Some were at Basel, some in Rome, some elsewhere.\n\nKey factions:\n- French faction (aligned with Basel, led by figures like Cardinal d'Allemand/Louis Aleman)\n- Roman families (Colonna, Orsini) who have vested interests in Camera arrangements\n- Papal loyalists (varying degrees of genuine loyalty vs. self-interest)\n- Reform-minded cardinals who might support cleaning up corruption\n\nEugenius should be honest but also uncertain. He's been avoiding looking too closely at who is truly loyal.\n\nLet me draft the response. The Pope should:\n1. Answer the question about the consistory/College of Cardinals\n2. Be honest about the composition - some enemies, some allies, many uncertain\n3. Show his uncertainty about who he can truly trust\n4. Not be too helpful - Juan needs to figure out the political landscape\n5. Perhaps steer toward his own concerns about appearing to bypass legitimate Church governance\n\nThe Vatican\nPrivate Audience Chamber\n\nEugenius exhales slowly. The question has forced him to confront something he has been avoiding—taking a true inventory of his own princes of the Church.\n\n\"The College of Cardinals.\" He moves to his chair, sits heavily. \"Twenty-four men currently hold the red hat. Some are here in Rome. Some at Basel. Some scattered across their dioceses or on various missions.\"\n\nHe begins to count on his fingers, his voice dropping lower.\n\n\"In Rome, at this moment? Perhaps... fourteen. Fifteen.\" He pauses. \"Of those—\"\n\nHis jaw tightens.\n\n\"The Roman families first. Prospero Colonna. Giordano Orsini—yes, the same Orsini who was so cold to your Fray Hernando. His loyalty is to his family first, the Church second, and Us a distant third. These men have nephews and cousins throughout the Camera. They have built the system we seek to reform. They will oppose us absolutely.\"\n\nHe raises another finger.\n\n\"The French. Cardinal Jean de Rochetaillée is here, watching everything for d'Allemand in Basel. Anything discussed in consistory reaches Basel within a week. He will frame any reform as tyranny, any audit as persecution.\"\n\nAnother finger.\n\n\"Then there are those who are simply... comfortable. Cardinals who have grown fat on the current arrangements. Who have benefices in three countries, households of fifty servants, palaces that rival princes. They may not actively conspire, but they will not welcome anyone examining how they live.\"\n\nHe falls silent for a moment. His hands drop to his lap.\n\n\"Allies.\" The word comes out strained. \"Capranica—you met him at Mass. He has whispered of reform before. Albergati, perhaps. He is old, devout, genuinely troubled by what he sees. Parentucelli is not yet a cardinal, but he is influential in the Curia and honest—We think.\"\n\nHe looks up at Juan.\n\n\"Three. Perhaps four. Out of twenty-four.\" A bitter laugh escapes him. \"And even these—We do not know how they will respond when the hammer actually falls. It is easy to whisper of reform in private. It is another thing to stand beside a Pope who has just seized the Camera with foreign knights.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"So yes. If We summon a formal consistory to discuss this, We are summoning the enemy to vote on their own destruction. They will delay. They will demand procedures, consultations, committees. They will bury reform in process until Our resolve weakens or Our health fails.\"\n\nHis voice hardens.\n\n\"This is why We spoke of motu proprio. Of acting first and explaining after. The consistory exists to advise Us—not to command Us. We are not required to seek their permission.\" A pause. \"But acting without them, against them, while foreign soldiers hold the Camera...\"\n\nHe trails off, the implications hanging in the air.\n\n\"You see Our dilemma, King Juan. Move through proper channels, and the corrupt cardinals will strangle reform in its cradle. Move around them, and We hand Basel exactly the evidence they need to call Us a tyrant controlled by Spain.\"\n\nHis eyes search Juan's face.\n\n\"How did you manage this in Castile? Your nobles, your councils—how did you reform without giving your enemies the weapons to destroy you?\""

Then he moves to the window, staring out at Rome as he speaks.\n\n\"We mentioned others earlier. Let Us think on them more carefully.\"\n\nHe raises a finger.\n\n\"Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. Carthusian. Old now—nearly seventy. He has lived simply his entire life. No palace, no great household, no mistresses or nephews enriching themselves on Church funds.\" A pause. \"He has been troubled by the corruption for years. We have seen it in his face during consistory—the way he looks away when certain expenditures are approved. He is genuinely devout.\"\n\nHis voice drops.\n\n\"But he is old, Juan. And cautious by nature. The Carthusians are contemplatives, not warriors. Albergati has survived by being agreeable, by not making enemies. If We bring him into this room and tell him We intend to bring down the hammer on the Camera tonight—\" Eugenius shakes his head. \"He might support Us in prayer. We do not know if he would support Us in action. And his health is not strong. The shock alone might...\"\n\nHe trails off, raises another finger.\n\n\"Tommaso Parentucelli. Not a cardinal—not yet—but influential. He serves as secretary to Albergati, in fact. Younger. Brilliant. A scholar who came from nothing and rose through merit alone. He has no family connections to the Roman powers, no income beyond his salary, no reason to protect the current system.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"We have spoken with him privately. He burns with quiet fury at what he sees. The waste. The simony. The way talented men are passed over for nephews and favorites.\" Eugenius turns back to face Juan. \"If anyone in the Curia would embrace reform genuinely, it is Parentucelli. But he has no power of his own. No vote in consistory. No troops, no wealth, no family to call upon. He could help Us write the decree—he is a finer Latinist than any scribe—but he cannot protect Us.\"\n\nA third finger, more reluctantly.\n\n\"Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville. French, yes, but not d'Allemand's creature. He has quarreled with the French faction over matters of procedure. He is ambitious—very ambitious—but his ambition runs toward being seen as a statesman, a builder, a man of consequence.\" Eugenius's expression is uncertain. \"He might support reform if he believed it would succeed and he could share the credit. But French... and ambitious. A dangerous combination.\"\n\nHe lets his hand fall.\n\n\"So. Albergati is honest but old and timid. Parentucelli is trustworthy but powerless. D'Estouteville is capable but French and self-interested. Capranica is...\" He searches for the word. \"Capranica is the most useful—connected, respected, energetic—but also the most opaque. We cannot read his true heart.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan directly.\n\n\"If We must choose one to bring into this room tonight, who would you choose? Or do We write this decree alone, just the two of Us, and trust no one until the hammer has already fallen?\""

Perhaps secretly hopes this could be his path to advancement.\n- What won't he say? That he's terrified of the powerful men who control the Curia. That he's dreamed of this moment but never believed it would come. That he wonders if this is a test. His own ambitions.\n\nI should draft a scene where Parentucelli is summoned and arrives. Given that Eugenius described him favorably and Juan chose him specifically for his trustworthiness, I don't need a d100 roll for whether he shows up - that's certain. But his reaction to what's being proposed could warrant a roll, or I could just roleplay it given the established characterization.\n\nLet me write the scene of summoning him and his arrival, then have him react in character - cautious at first (this could be a test), then increasingly engaged as he realizes this is real.\n\nThe Vatican\nPrivate Audience Chamber\n\nEugenius nods slowly. \"Parentucelli. Yes.\"\n\nHe moves to the door, opens it a crack. The corridor beyond is empty save for a single papal guard at the far end. No sign of Capranica or the secretary—they must have withdrawn further when dismissed.\n\n\"Guard.\"\n\nThe man approaches, kneels. \"Holy Father.\"\n\n\"Find Tommaso Parentucelli. He will be in Cardinal Albergati's quarters, or in the library. Tell him—\" Eugenius pauses, choosing words carefully. \"Tell him the Holy Father requires his assistance with a matter of correspondence. Urgent. He is to come alone and speak to no one of the summons.\"\n\n\"At once, Holy Father.\"\n\nThe guard departs. Eugenius closes the door and turns back to Juan.\n\n\"It will take perhaps a quarter hour. Albergati's quarters are in the Apostolic Palace, not far.\" He moves to the writing desk, touches the quill and inkwell there. \"While we wait—we should consider what we tell him. How much. How quickly.\"\n\nHe turns.\n\n\"Parentucelli is not a fool. He will know the moment he enters this room that something extraordinary is happening. A private audience with the Pope and the King of Castile, summoned in secret, told to speak to no one?\" A thin smile. \"He will be frightened. He will wonder if this is a test—if someone has accused him of disloyalty and he is being examined.\"\n\nEugenius settles into a chair.\n\n\"We must put him at ease quickly. And then—\" He looks at Juan. \"Do we tell him everything? The Camera, the reform, the knights, the decree? Or do we reveal it piece by piece, watching his reactions?\"\n\nThe fire crackles. Somewhere distant, a church bell marks the hour.\n\n\"You have more experience with this than We do, King Juan. How do you take the measure of a man in such moments?\""

When he speaks, his voice is quiet.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nA long pause.\n\n\"An honest examination would uncover... much.\" He does not turn around. \"The Camera has operated in shadow for decades. Perhaps longer. Every Pope since Avignon has relied on it, drawn from it, and chosen not to look too closely at how it functions.\"\n\nHis shoulders tighten.\n\n\"Cardinals have enriched their families. Offices have been sold. Revenues meant for the maintenance of churches have been diverted to palaces. Funds designated for charitable works have been...\" He waves a hand vaguely. \"Reallocated. The crusade treasury you deposited—We told you We do not know how much remains. That is true. But We suspect. We suspect it has been touched, despite Our instructions.\"\n\nHe turns now, and his face is drawn.\n\n\"Corruption at the highest level. You ask this carefully, Juan of Castile. We understand what you are truly asking.\" His eyes meet Juan's. \"You are asking whether an examination would uncover evidence against Us. Against the Pope himself.\"\n\nHe moves back to his chair, sits heavily.\n\n\"We have signed documents. Many documents. Authorizations for transfers, for expenditures, for payments We did not fully understand. We told Ourselves We were delegating to men who knew the Camera's workings better than We did. We told Ourselves it was necessary—that the threats We faced required flexibility, speed, resources.\" His voice is bitter. \"We told Ourselves many things.\"\n\nA long silence.\n\n\"Would an honest examination find that We knowingly stole from the Church? No. We have taken nothing for Ourselves. Our chambers are modest. Our household is small. We have no nephews growing fat on benefices, no mistresses draped in jewels.\" He spreads his hands, showing their emptiness. \"But would it find that We were negligent? That We signed what We should not have signed? That We failed in Our duty to guard the treasury of Peter?\"\n\nHis jaw tightens.\n\n\"Yes. It would find that.\"\n\nHe looks at Juan directly.\n\n\"If We bring down this hammer, it may fall on Us as well. Not as a thief—but as a fool. A Pope who let himself be used. Is that a price worth paying? We believe it is. We must believe it is, or We cannot do what must be done.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"But you should know this before We proceed. When the Camera's secrets are dragged into the light, some of that light will fall on the chair of Peter. And Our enemies will use it. They will say We reform only to hide Our own sins. They will say the audit is theater, designed to blame others for what We permitted.\"\n\nHis voice drops.\n\n\"Can this reform survive that? Can We survive it? These are questions We cannot answer alone.\""

If we pass reform it may for a moment seem like everything is against us, but soon, everyone will be on our side if we truly fight corruption.\n\n\nWe could state for example that from this moment on, things will be different. From this moment on, we restart the camerta with a clean set of obligations and income. The new decree on annates indicates that half of papal income goes to the college of cardinals so the cardinals get a different income stream as well. We cannot be seen to come for their heads, but we should rather say: we are making a fresh start. From now on, no more new pluralism and all existing arrangements to and from the camera end. Half of the papal income goes directly to funding the papal residence, security, scribes and other expenses, and the other half goes to the cardinals to improve the service of their areas. If we open corruption investigations against all cardinals, they will have no choice but to fight us to the death."
