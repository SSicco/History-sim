I've reviewed all the necessary files and understand where we're beginning. Let me provide the opening situation for Chapter 44.\n\nCHAPTER 44: THE TE DEUM\n\nApril 5, 1433 - Granada, Royal Quarters in the Alhambra\n\nDawn breaks over Granada on the day the Reconquista officially ends. Seven hundred and ten years since Pelayo's defiant stand at Covadonga, since a ragged band of Christian warriors held a cave in the Asturian mountains against the Moorish tide. And now, this morning, in the city that was Islam's final stronghold in Iberia, the kings of Christian Spain will gather in what was once the Great Mosque to sing Te Deum Laudamus - \"We Praise Thee, O God.\"\n\nYou're in the royal quarters, the morning light filtering through the geometric windows of the Alhambra. Captain Fernán reports that the cathedral is ready, the guests are assembling, and the procession will form within the hour. King João of Portugal arrived yesterday evening with a small delegation, embracing you warmly and calling you \"son.\" King Alfonso of Aragón is already in his chambers, along with Don Bernat de Centelles. The Infantes Juan and Enrique are breaking their fast in the hall below. Eight hundred crusaders stand ready in the courtyard, their white tabards with the red Jerusalem crosses brilliant in the morning sun. The True Cross fragment and Santiago's bone rest in their reliquaries, prepared for the procession.\n\nCommander Martín de Alcalá and Fernando (Ahmad al-Zarqali) wait nearby - you promised them a private briefing before they depart for Morocco. Don García has reported that the Genoese ships are ready in Málaga, eight large transport vessels contracted for the journey to Rome, waiting for your signal to embark.\n\nWhat do you do?"

The conversation ended with Alfonso agreeing to the framework and both preparing for Te Deum ceremony.\"\n\nThe Chapter 43 summary shows the Te Deum was scheduled for \"early April\" and that it would be attended by all the monarchs. The summary's \"Looking Forward\" section for Chapter 44 explicitly lists:\n\n\"**Expected Content:**\n- Te Deum ceremony celebration (all Iberian Christian monarchs assembled)\n- Infante Juan carrying sacred relic in procession\n- Formal conclusion of Granada crusade vows\n- Morocco delegation finalization and briefing\n- Departure from Granada to Málaga for sea journey\"\n\nSo the Te Deum ceremony IS supposed to happen in Chapter 44, but I jumped ahead to April 5th (the morning of the ceremony) without giving the player a chance to act during April 4th. \n\nThe player should have had the opportunity to:\n1.

I need to acknowledge it and reset to the proper time.\n\nYou're absolutely right - I apologize for that error. I violated player agency by advancing time without your input.\n\nLet me reset to where Chapter 43 actually ended:\n\nCHAPTER 44\n\nEvening of April 3, 1433 - Granada, Royal Quarters in the Alhambra\n\nYour private conversation with King Alfonso has just concluded. The alliance framework is sketched - three kingdoms united for eternal crusade, Naples as the first objective with papal backing, succession arrangements binding your families together. Alfonso departed to his chambers, his face showing relief and determination both.\n\nThe evening is quiet now. Through the geometric windows of the Alhambra, you can see the city settling into night. Tomorrow is April 4th - the Te Deum ceremony will be in the next day or two, whenever you schedule it. King João of Portugal should arrive tomorrow or the day after. The Infantes are already here. Don Bernat de Centelles waits with Alfonso's delegation.\n\nCommander Martín de Alcalá and Fernando (Ahmad al-Zarqali) are somewhere in the palace - you promised them a briefing about their Morocco mission before they depart after the ceremony. Don García reported earlier that the Genoese ships are ready in Málaga, waiting for your signal. Eight hundred crusaders are quartered throughout the palace grounds.\n\nYou have at least a full day, possibly two, before the ceremony needs to happen.\n\nWhat do you do?"

The succession arrangement was just proposed by Juan - Alfonso as heir if Juan has no son - but nothing has been sealed, witnessed, or made official. It was a bold proposal in private conversation.\n\nLet me go back and read exactly where Chapter 43 ended to see what the actual state of the conversation was.\n\nLooking at the end of Chapter 43:\n- Juan proposed making Alfonso his heir if he has no son\n- Alfonso was moved and accepted\n- They discussed the Naples situation - Juan would \"feel out\" the Pope about whether it could be framed favorably\n- Don Bernat would brief Juan about the Pope\n- But the conversation had NOT formally concluded - they were still talking\n\nI need to:\n1. Go back to where we actually were in the conversation\n2. Clarify my misunderstanding about Naples\n3. Ask what the player wants to do to conclude the conversation with Alfonso, or continue it\n4. Correct my understanding of what has and hasn't been established\n\nYou're absolutely right, and I apologize for multiple serious errors. Let me correct my understanding:\n\nWhat I got wrong:\n\nThe conversation with Alfonso is still ongoing - I shouldn't have ended it without your input\n\nNaples is NOT a \"crusade against Christians\" - I completely misunderstood this. Alfonso has a legitimate dynastic claim to Naples (he believes). Juan offered to \"feel out\" whether the Pope might politically support Alfonso's claim (since René of Anjou is French-backed), NOT to declare a crusade against Christians. That would indeed violate Juan's beliefs.\n\nThe \"eternal crusade\" is Juan's private idea - not publicly established, just something Juan has thought about internally\n\nNo succession arrangement has been formalized - Juan made a bold proposal (Alfonso as heir if no son), Alfonso accepted emotionally, but nothing has been sealed, witnessed, or made official. It's still just a private conversation.\n\nQuestions to clarify:\n\nWhere exactly in the conversation with Alfonso should we resume? What was the last thing said between you?\n\nMy understanding now: Juan is exploring whether the Pope might politically support Alfonso's Naples claim (legitimate succession dispute) as part of building an alliance, NOT declaring it a crusade. Is this correct?\n\nWhat does Juan want to accomplish before concluding this conversation with Alfonso?\n\nPlease correct anything I'm still misunderstanding, and tell me where we should actually pick up."

The alliance makes strategic sense for both kingdoms\n4. Alfonso has no legitimate heirs of his own currently (historically accurate - he had illegitimate children but no legitimate ones)\n5. Juan is offering something extraordinary - potential union of Castile and Aragón\n6. Alfonso just saw Juan's willingness to take risks (the bold proposal)\n7. The mutual respect and spiritual connection established in previous conversation\n\n**FAILURE FACTORS:**\n1. This is an ENORMOUS political commitment - uniting two kingdoms\n2. Alfonso's nobles would need to accept this arrangement\n3. Juan might still have a son (Isabel is pregnant)\n4. The arrangement becomes moot if Juan has male heir\n5. Making it formal NOW, before knowing Pope's response on Naples, might seem premature\n6. Alfonso might want to consult his own advisors first\n7. This is literally reshaping Iberian politics - needs careful thought\n8. Formalizing before Pope weighs in might complicate Naples petition\n9. If they formalize and Pope rejects Naples support, Alfonso is committed without getting what he wants\n\n**KEY CONTEXT:**\n- Juan is asking Alfonso's opinion - showing respect for his judgment\n- Juan offers CHOICE: formalize now OR wait for Pope's answer\n- This is a mature, thoughtful approach - not rushing\n- Gives Alfonso agency in the decision\n\n**WHAT WOULD ALFONSO THINK?**\n\nAlfonso is deeply moved but also a practical king. He would likely:\n- Appreciate being asked rather than told\n- See wisdom in waiting for Pope's response (don't put cart before horse)\n- Want to formalize eventually but recognize timing matters\n- Be concerned about formalizing before knowing if Naples support materializes\n\n- Carefully weigh the political implications of immediate commitment\n- Recognize the delicate balance between emotional connection and strategic calculation\n\nI see the nuanced political calculation. Waiting provides strategic flexibility, allowing Alfonso to assess the papal response and potential Naples support. Yet the emotional pull of Juan's offer is strong - a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape the political landscape. The decision hinges on balancing immediate emotional resonance with long-term political prudence.\n\nThe spiritual dimension adds complexity. Alfonso feels a profound connection that transcends typical diplomatic negotiations, wanting to demonstrate absolute trust while simultaneously protecting his kingdom's interests.\n\nA nuanced compromise emerges: a private sealed document with minimal witnesses, strategically delaying public formalization until after their Roman consultation. This approach balances emotional commitment with political prudence, revealing Alfonso's sophisticated understanding of statecraft and personal loyalty.\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nAlfonso already accepted emotionally when you first proposed the arrangement\n\nThe strategic logic is compelling for both kingdoms\n\nAlfonso is deeply moved by your trust and spiritual vision\n\nYou're showing respect by asking his opinion rather than demanding\n\nThe mutual respect and connection established in previous conversation\n\nAlfonso has no legitimate heirs currently (only illegitimate children)\n\nYou're giving him choice - formalize now OR wait\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nThis is an enormous political commitment affecting two kingdoms\n\nAlfonso's nobles would need to accept this arrangement\n\nIsabel is pregnant - you might still have a son, making it moot\n\nFormalizing before knowing Pope's response on Naples might be premature\n\nAlfonso might want to consult his own advisors first\n\nCommitting before Pope weighs in could complicate Naples petition\n\nIf formalized now and Pope rejects Naples support, Alfonso is committed without getting what he wants politically\n\nProper timing and sequencing matters in high-stakes diplomacy\n\nD100 TABLE - ALFONSO'S RESPONSE TO INHERITANCE TIMING:\n\n1-15: Wants to formalize NOW - spiritual/emotional response overrides political caution. The moment feels sacred, doesn't want to lose it by waiting. \"When God shows you a glimpse of His kingdom, you don't ask Him to wait while you consult advisors.\"\n\n16-45: Suggests WAITING but clearly torn - sees wisdom in proper timing but worried you'll think he doubts you. Tries to explain both his desire to commit AND his political reasoning for patience.\n\n46-75: Suggests WAITING with clear practical reasoning - appreciates being asked, explains political wisdom of sequencing. \"Let's feel out the Pope first on Naples. If he supports it, this arrangement serves both kingdoms perfectly. The order matters for both our courts.\"\n\n76-90: Defers to your judgment on timing - trusts your discernment, will follow your lead. \"You've shown wisdom in these matters beyond your years. Whatever you think best.\"\n\n91-100: Proposes creative MIDDLE PATH - perhaps private sealed document now, witnessed by one trusted person each, formalized publicly after Rome?

He's thinking about:\n1. What can be announced publicly vs what stays private\n2. How to present it to nobles of both kingdoms\n3. Timing relative to Naples campaign\n4. What papal support actually looks like\n\nAlfonso would probably lay out a sequence, but also acknowledge this needs to be refined based on what the Pope actually says/does.\n\nAlfonso nods, appreciating the direct question. He's clearly been thinking about this.\n\n\"If the Pope shifts his support - even quietly, even just removing backing from René rather than openly endorsing me - then we have our opening.\" He paces a step, working through it aloud.\n\n\"First, we formalize the succession arrangement privately. Witnessed by trusted advisors from both kingdoms. Sealed documents. Then we announce a formal alliance between Castile and Aragón - mutual defense, coordinated crusading efforts, trade privileges. That's unremarkable enough that nobles accept it.\"\n\nHe turns back to you. \"The succession part? We can present it carefully: 'In the event King Juan has no male heir, King Alfonso of Aragón is named as heir to Castile, uniting the kingdoms under shared crusading vision.' Your nobles see it as securing the kingdom's future. My nobles see it as Aragón gaining Castile if circumstances fall that way.\"\n\nAlfonso pauses. \"But we don't announce that until your queen delivers in August. If Isabel bears you a son, the arrangement becomes moot - and we simply have a strong alliance. If she bears a daughter, or...\" he hesitates delicately, \"if complications arise, then we formalize it publicly with the succession question actually relevant.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes. \"The key is: when we announce it, we frame it as two crusading kings binding their kingdoms for eternal war against Islam.

João is indeed the expert here - Portugal has been developing African trade since his time, and he took Ceuta in 1415. He's wealthy from this trade and would have sophisticated understanding of maritime commerce.\n\nThis is a natural conversation between two allied kings. João would be pleased Juan is asking for his expertise and showing respect for Portuguese achievements. He'd also see opportunity for mutual benefit.\n\nI should keep this conversational, not a lecture. João would speak from experience, maybe share some stories, give practical advice. He'd also be sizing up whether this young king really understands what he's getting into with maritime trade.\n\nJoão's expression shifts to genuine interest - this is clearly a subject close to his heart. He gestures to a nearby bench where you can both sit more comfortably.\n\n\"Ah, now you're asking the right questions!\" He settles onto the bench with a slight grunt. \"The Strait is the key to everything, Juan. Everything. When I took Ceuta in 1415 - God, eighteen years ago now - people said 'why waste gold on African rocks?' But I saw what you see: control the gateway, control the trade.\"\n\nHe leans forward, animated. \"Here's what most Christian kingdoms don't understand: the gold, the ivory, the spices - they don't start in the ports. They come from deep in Africa, across the Sahara on camel caravans. Months of travel. By the time they reach the coast, the goods have passed through a dozen Muslim hands, each taking their share.\"\n\nJoão takes a drink. \"The Italians - Venice, Genoa - they figured this out. They don't just raid Muslim ports. They trade with them. Treaties, safe passage, warehouses in Alexandria and Tunis. They make fortunes as middlemen.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"So here's what we could do: You hold Gibraltar and Málaga. I hold Ceuta. Between us, we control both sides of the Strait. Every ship going from Mediterranean to Atlantic, or Atlantic to Mediterranean, passes through our waters.\"\n\n\"The question is: do we squeeze them with tolls and make quick gold? Or do we become partners - make it so profitable to use our ports that everyone routes through us voluntarily?\"\n\nHe pauses. \"What's your instinct?

But the player is asking practical questions: what does it actually DO for Portugal?\n\nHistorically, Ceuta was:\n1. Primarily symbolic/military - a foothold in Africa, prestige\n2. Very expensive to maintain - constant garrison, supply lines\n3. NOT particularly profitable as a trade port because Muslim merchants simply rerouted around it\n4. More of a strategic naval base than commercial hub\n5. The gold/spice routes shifted to other ports to avoid Christian control\n\nJoão would be honest about this - he's old, experienced, and talking to family. He'd acknowledge the costs and the limitations while still defending the strategic value. This is a chance for realistic medieval economics - prestige projects often lost money but served political purposes.\n\nJoão might also be interested in what Juan suggests - perhaps with both sides controlled, they could do something different than what Portugal alone could do with just Ceuta.\n\nJoão's expression becomes more rueful, the enthusiasm dimming slightly. He takes a long drink before answering.\n\n\"You're asking the question my own treasury ministers ask me every year.\" He sighs. \"Ceuta costs me a fortune. Garrison, supplies, everything shipped across the Strait. And the trade?\" He shakes his head. \"Less than I hoped, Juan. Much less.\"\n\nHe sets down his cup. \"When we took it, I thought - we control this port, the African trade flows through us, we become rich. But here's what happened: the Muslim merchants simply went to other ports. Tangier, Salé, further down the coast. They'd rather travel extra days than trade through a Christian fortress where we tax them and they don't trust us.\"\n\nJoão spreads his hands. \"So what does Ceuta give me? Prestige - I conquered Muslim territory in Africa. A naval base - my ships can control the Strait's southern side, protect our merchants, raid Barbary pirates. A foothold - if we ever want to expand deeper into Morocco.\"\n\nHe looks at you candidly. \"But profitable? No. It bleeds gold. My son Duarte argues we should abandon it. My wife's family says the same. But I can't - it's my legacy, my achievement. The first Portuguese king to plant our flag in Africa.\"\n\nHe leans back. \"But now you hold Gibraltar and Málaga. And I'm thinking... alone, Ceuta is expensive prestige. Together? Perhaps we can do what I couldn't alone - actually make the Muslim merchants want to use our ports instead of avoiding them.\"\n\n\"What are you thinking?\"\n\nWhat do you say?"

The dream of every king who holds one side of the Strait.\" He gestures toward the darkening sky beyond the windows. \"But the reality is harder than it seems.\"\n\nHe counts off on his fingers. \"First - the Strait at its narrowest is still eight, maybe nine miles across. To actually stop every ship? We'd need galleys constantly patrolling, day and night. Dozens of them. The cost...\" He whistles low. \"It would bankrupt both our kingdoms just to maintain the patrols.\"\n\n\"Second - enforcement. A Venetian merchant convoy with armed galleys - do we fight them if they refuse to pay? Start a war with Venice over toll fees? What about Genoese? Catalans? The Italians have bigger navies than both of us combined.\"\n\nJoão leans forward. \"Third - alternatives. If we squeeze too hard, Muslim merchants go to Moroccan ports further south, the Italian cities find other routes, trade shifts to overland through France. We don't control enough to truly bottle up Mediterranean trade.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"But... what if instead of forcing licenses, we made our ports so attractive that ships choose them? Lower fees than anywhere else. Safe harbors. Fast customs. Warehouses and facilities. Make it cheaper and easier to stop at Málaga or Ceuta than to avoid us.\"\n\n\"The merchant's way, not the soldier's way. It's slower profit, but sustainable.\"\n\nHe looks at you. \"What do you think? Am I being too cautious?\"\n\nWhat do you say?"

Then King João sets down his wine cup with a solid thunk on the table.\n\n\"By God, the boy's right!\" His voice carries across the hall, and suddenly every conversation stops. \"Listen to him! LOOK at us!\" He sweeps his arm to encompass the gathered kings. \"When was the last time this happened? My father never stood in the same room with the King of Castile and called him family. My grandfather certainly didn't!\"\n\nKing Alfonso steps forward, his face flushed - whether from wine or emotion, it's hard to tell. \"Juan speaks truth. We spend so much time worrying about borders, about who gets which fortress, which marriage alliance...\" He shakes his head. \"And meanwhile, what have we accomplished separately? But together?\" He gestures toward the windows, toward Granada itself. \"Together we ended the Reconquista.\"\n\nInfante Juan de Aragón - the man who once rebelled against you - raises his cup. His voice is thick with emotion. \"I once thought Aragón and Castile were natural enemies. That we had to fight for every scrap of power.\" He looks directly at you. \"You showed me I was a fool. You showed me what we could be instead.\"\n\nHis brother Enrique nods vigorously. \"Let the French kings and German princes squabble. Let them fight over muddy fields in Burgundy. We...\" He slams his fist on the table, making cups jump. \"We have something better here!\"\n\nJoão is grinning broadly now. \"So here's what we do. Not vague promises about 'staying in touch.' Real meetings. Regular ones.\" He looks around at the other monarchs. \"Once a year - maybe here in Granada to remember what we accomplished. Or rotating between our kingdoms. But scheduled. On the calendar. With our families.\"\n\n\"My wife would love that,\" he adds with a chuckle. \"She'd get to see Isabel and Catalina every year instead of waiting for letters.\"\n\nAlfonso nods firmly. \"Agreed. And not just celebrations - councils. Real discussion about how we support each other. Trade. Military coordination if any of us faces threats.\" He glances at you meaningfully - you both know he's thinking about Naples, about Constantinople, about the larger vision.\n\nDon Bernat de Centelles, standing slightly behind Alfonso, speaks up - he's been watching this unfold with the calculating eye of an experienced diplomat. \"Your Majesties, if I may... what you're describing is unprecedented. An Iberian council of kings. Not a formal empire, not one king ruling others, but...\" He searches for words. \"A family of kingdoms.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" João slaps the table. \"Exactly that! A family!\"\n\nAround the hall, nobles and advisors are watching with mixed expressions - some clearly moved, others calculating what this means for their own interests. But the four kings themselves - you, João, Alfonso, the Infantes - there's genuine warmth, genuine commitment in this moment.\n\nInfante Juan raises his cup high. \"Then let's swear it. Not formal oaths, not treaties that lawyers pick apart. Just... our word. As Christian kings. As family.\" He looks at each of you in turn. \"We meet every year. We support each other. We build something together that our fathers couldn't imagine.\"\n\nEveryone is looking at you now - you started this, and they're waiting to see how you seal it.\n\nWhat do you say or do?"

Juan instructs them to operate independently, hide their conversion if needed for safety, and reveals nothing of his conquest plans. A d100 roll (71) for the six-month outcome yields moderate success: presence established in Tangier and Tetouan, basic intelligence network functioning, small trade growing, but Sale remains too hostile.

The formality of kingship gives way to something simpler: men who've found fellowship in shared purpose.\n\nYou retire late, your heart full. The alliance framework with Alfonso, the commitment of Iberian unity, João calling you \"son\" - the pieces are falling into place.\n\nMorning of April 4, 1433 - Private Chamber in the Alhambra\n\nDawn light filters through the geometric windows as you enter a smaller chamber where the Morocco delegation has assembled. The air carries the scent of mint tea - someone has prepared refreshments in the Moorish style.\n\nCommander Martín de Alcalá stands near the window, his bearing still that of the legendary fortress commander he once was. At fifty, his beard shows gray, but his eyes are sharp. Beside him sits Fernando - the former qadi whose intellectual crisis brought him to Christ. He's reviewing what appear to be maps and documents.\n\nAround the chamber are gathered approximately twenty-five men - the core of the delegation. All are converts from the Granada campaign, most from Alcalá la Real's garrison. They're dressed practically for travel, a mix of Moorish and Christian clothing that will help them blend in Morocco. These are men who've proven their conversion genuine through two years of service, who understand both worlds.\n\nDon García López de Padilla stands to one side, present as temporary Governor to witness the briefing.\n\nCommander Martín rises when you enter, bowing respectfully. \"Your Majesty.

Most were captured during the coastal campaigns - they came as reinforcements by sea but were cut off when we took the ports.\" He pauses, consulting mental tallies. \"The majority are from two contingents: one that landed at Málaga before we besieged it, another that tried to reinforce Almería.\"\n\nCommander Martín adds, his voice carrying the weight of someone who fought against these men: \"They're mostly Marinid troops - regular soldiers, not elite units. The Sultan of Morocco sent what he could spare, but his kingdom is... fragmented. The Marinids control Fez and some coastal cities, but their power has weakened significantly over the past decades.\"\n\nFernando speaks up, his scholarly precision evident: \"The Marinid dynasty is in decline, Your Majesty. When I was studying in Granada, we received news regularly from Morocco. There are rival power centers - the Wattasids gaining influence, Berber tribes in the interior largely independent, coastal cities sometimes acting autonomously. It's not one unified kingdom in the way Castile or Granada was.\"\n\nDon García continues: \"The prisoners have been treated well by your standing orders - fed, housed properly, no abuse. Some have expressed interest in conversion, though we've been careful not to pressure them. Most simply want to go home.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"They could be very useful for your purposes, Your Majesty.

These are men with direct knowledge - Martín and Fernando are from Granada and understand the region, Fernando particularly as a former qadi/scholar. They should provide realistic assessment based on:\n\n1. Morocco's political fragmentation (Marinids declining, multiple power centers)\n2. Muslim-Christian relations and trust issues\n3. Practical challenges of maintaining presence\n4. Opportunities that converted Muslims as intermediaries create\n5. Historical context of North African-Iberian relations\n\nThis should be informative and realistic, not overly optimistic or pessimistic. They're helping Juan understand what's actually possible.\n\nCommander Martín and Fernando exchange a glance, then Martín speaks first.\n\n\"Embassies in the formal sense? Difficult, Your Majesty. Christian ambassadors in Muslim cities face... complications. Housing, security, the simple fact that many Muslims would refuse to do business with official representatives of a Christian king who just conquered Granada.\" He pauses. \"But we...\" He gestures to himself and the assembled converts. \"We can move differently.\"\n\nFernando leans forward, his scholarly mind working through the problem. \"Your Majesty, what you're describing exists already in reverse. Muslim merchants have networks throughout Christian ports - Valencia, Barcelona, even Genoa. They maintain funduqs - merchant houses that serve as combination warehouse, hostel, and informal embassy. Not official, but effective.\"\n\nHe continues: \"We could establish something similar. Converted Muslims who maintain trade houses in Moroccan coastal cities - Tangier, Salé, Ceuta's hinterland, perhaps Tétouan. Officially merchants. Practically, your eyes and ears. A way to send messages, gather information, build relationships.\"\n\nCommander Martín nods. \"The key is we don't arrive announcing 'we represent the King of Castile.' We arrive as Muslim traders - many of us still speak Arabic as our first language, know the customs, have family connections across the Strait. Some of these men...\" He gestures to the delegation. \"...have cousins in Moroccan cities. Former trade partners. Old friendships.\"\n\nDon García adds his perspective: \"Trade itself is absolutely possible, Your Majesty. Morocco exports leather, wool, some grain. They need timber, iron, manufactured goods. The question isn't whether trade can happen - it's whether it flows through your ports or continues through traditional Muslim channels that avoid Christian interference.\"\n\nFernando looks at you seriously. \"But Your Majesty, establishing this will take time. Years, not months. We need to earn trust, prove we're not just spies preparing invasion. The prisoner release you mentioned - that's an excellent start. Releasing three hundred men with no ransom expected? That will be noticed. That will be talked about.\"\n\nCommander Martín adds: \"And we should be honest about our conversion, not hide it. If we pretend to still be Muslim and they discover the deception, we lose everything. But if we're open - 'Yes, we converted, but we still respect our brothers, we still want trade and peace' - that's different. Unusual, but honest.\"\n\nWhat do you say or do?"

Commander Martín and Fernando should respond positively - this aligns with what they were already thinking, and gives them clear objectives without micromanaging. They're experienced men who can work out the details.\n\nI should have them acknowledge the instructions, perhaps ask clarifying questions or offer practical insights about how they'll approach this, then see if Juan has more to say or if he's ready to conclude the briefing.\n\nCommander Martín nods firmly. \"Clear objectives, Your Majesty. Understand the landscape - political, commercial, tribal. Find out who actually holds power versus who claims it. And build something that lasts beyond one visit.\"\n\nFernando pulls out one of the documents he was reviewing - it appears to be a rough map of the Moroccan coast. \"We've been discussing our approach. Initially, we'll focus on three cities: Tangier, Tétouan, and Salé.\" He points to each location. \"Tangier because it's closest to Ceuta and the Strait - the most immediate neighbor. Tétouan because it's a major market city with strong trade connections. Salé because it's near the Marinid power center and has direct connections to the interior caravan routes.\"\n\nCommander Martín adds: \"We'll split into smaller groups. Three or four men per city - enough to support each other, few enough not to seem threatening. We arrive as traders and former Granada soldiers seeking opportunity after the fall. Which is true, in a sense.\"\n\nOne of the other converts speaks up - an older man you recognize from the Alcalá garrison. \"Your Majesty, about the Sultan's authority... from what we heard before Granada fell, many coastal cities barely acknowledge Fez anymore. The Marinids have been weak for decades. The jihad failure will make it worse. Local governors and tribal leaders may be more important than the Sultan himself.\"\n\nFernando nods. \"Which means we need to understand the local power structures in each city. Who controls the port? Who collects taxes? Who leads Friday prayers? That tells us who really matters.\"\n\nCommander Martín looks at you directly. \"Your Majesty, we'll send regular reports. Every two months, one of us returns to Granada or Málaga with written intelligence and verbal briefings. If something urgent develops, we send word immediately through fishing boats or traders.\"\n\nDon García interjects: \"I can establish a system in Málaga to receive and forward these reports to Toledo, Your Majesty. Dedicated couriers.\"\n\nFernando adds one more consideration: \"The prisoner release - when should we deliver them? Arriving with three hundred freed soldiers is the perfect introduction.

The mission could yield promising results, establishing a foothold in multiple Moroccan cities. Successful intelligence gathering and initial trade connections would demonstrate the delegation's strategic value. The team's deep cultural understanding and carefully planned approach might overcome initial suspicions, creating opportunities for meaningful diplomatic and economic exchange.\n\nSUCCESS FACTORS:\n\nCommander Martín legendary with 32 years military experience, respected figure\n\nFernando scholarly, can engage educated Muslims intellectually\n\nAll delegates speak fluent Arabic, know customs, some have family connections across Strait\n\nReleasing 300 prisoners with no ransom extraordinarily generous - creates obligation in Muslim culture\n\nMorocco genuinely fragmented - Marinid dynasty weak, local authorities semi-autonomous\n\nTrade mutually beneficial - Morocco needs timber, iron, manufactured goods\n\nClear, reasonable mission parameters - not demanding immediate results\n\nWell-funded from crown purse for sustained operation\n\nPatient approach over years, not forcing quick results\n\nMuslim merchant networks already exist as model to follow\n\nFAILURE FACTORS:\n\nThese are converts from Granada, the kingdom that just fell to Christian crusade\n\nMany Muslims will view them as traitors regardless of explanation\n\nGranada's fall may unite Moroccan sentiment AGAINST any Castilian presence\n\nSome delegates may indeed turn traitor when back in Muslim lands (player expects this)\n\nReligious persecution risk - converted Muslims returning may be imprisoned or killed\n\nPolitical fragmentation means no central authority - must negotiate city by city\n\nSome freed prisoners might warn locals these are \"Castilian spies\"\n\nPirates, bandits, disease, maritime hazards along dangerous coast\n\n6 months short timeline for deep relationship building\n\nLocal governors might see opportunity for ransom/hostages\n\nJihad failure may make Moroccans MORE hostile to Castile, not less\n\nD100 TABLE - MOROCCO DELEGATION RESULTS (6 MONTHS):\n\n1-15: Catastrophic Failure - Multiple delegates killed or imprisoned within first months. Local authorities in Tangier and Tétouan view them as spies/traitors. One or two delegates renounced conversion under pressure and revealed mission details, though limited actual intelligence to betray. Freed prisoners testified these were \"apostates.\" No trade established. Moroccan coastal cities now actively hostile to any Castilian presence. 2-3 survivors fled back to Málaga with horror stories.\n\n16-35: Significant Failure - Hostile reception in 2 of 3 target cities. Several delegates imprisoned or expelled. One killed in Salé. Religious authorities demanded they renounce conversion; most refused but had to flee. Freed prisoners' gratitude overwhelmed by religious outrage at apostasy. Minimal intelligence gained (basic city descriptions only). No trade relationships. 10-12 survivors returned, mission largely failed. Morocco clearly unwelcoming.\n\n36-55: Partial Success/Mixed Results - Tangier moderately receptive (closest to Portuguese Ceuta, already used to Christian proximity). Established small merchant presence there with 4-5 delegates. Tétouan hostile - delegates expelled after weeks. Salé dangerously uncertain - 2 delegates imprisoned but later released. Some intelligence gathered about Tangier's local power structure and Marinid weakness. Limited trade beginning (leather, wool). 15-18 delegates survived. Foothold exists but fragile.\n\n56-75: Moderate Success - Established presence in Tangier and Tétouan (2 of 3 cities). Local merchants cautiously receptive to trade opportunities. Some delegates faced hostility but Commander Martín's reputation and freed prisoners' testimony opened doors. Basic intelligence network functioning - reports on local governance, Marinid weakness confirmed, tribal dynamics partially understood. Small but growing trade (Moroccan leather/wool for Castilian timber/iron). 20-22 delegates operating. Salé remains too hostile to approach yet.\n\n76-90: Good Success - Presence established in all three target cities. Commander Martín's legend preceded him - \"the honorable enemy\" reputation from Granada campaign. Freed prisoners' gratitude created goodwill. Trade networks forming in Tangier and Tétouan, initial contacts in Salé. Solid intelligence: Marinid Sultan has little real authority in coastal cities, local governors operate independently, tribal leaders control interior. Several local merchants expressing interest in ongoing relationships. 23-24 delegates operating safely. Foundation laid for permanent presence.\n\n91-100: Exceptional Success - Warmly received in multiple cities beyond initial three targets. Commander Martín and Fernando's approach of \"honest converts who still respect Muslim brothers\" resonated with pragmatic merchants and local governors tired of Marinid weakness. Trade flourishing - Castilian goods flowing through new networks. Detailed intelligence on political factions: Wattasids gaining power, Berber tribes independent, coastal cities seeking stability. Two local governors requested direct meetings with Juan. Secret correspondence established with major merchant houses. All 25 delegates safe and operating. Request for additional personnel to expand to more cities. Morocco revealed as opportunity, not unified threat.\n\nRoll d100."

The conversion is complete - altar consecrated, Islamic elements removed or covered, Christian iconography installed. It will be ready for tomorrow's Te Deum.\"\n\nHe pauses, then continues carefully. \"As for the other mosques throughout the city and territories... the situation is more complex. Granada city alone had over thirty mosques. The mountain towns, coastal cities - hundreds more.\"\n\nHe pulls out a document. \"We've converted seventeen mosques in Granada city to churches. The larger ones in strategic locations. But Your Majesty...\" He looks at you directly. \"Converting every single mosque immediately would require either massive construction resources we don't have, or would leave fifty thousand Muslims with nowhere to pray. The latter creates... instability risks.\"\n\nThe Archbishop seems to be choosing his words very carefully, waiting to see your reaction before saying more.\n\nWhat do you say?"

          "text": "The Archbishop is being asked about the long-term trajectory of mosque conversions. This is a careful political and religious question. Juan is asking if the Archbishop is confident that eventually ALL mosques will be converted.\n\nThe Archbishop would likely understand:\n1. This is technically required by the crusade bull terms - converting Muslim lands to Christian rule\n2. But the practical reality of 300,000+ Muslims in Granada territories\n3. The tension between religious mandate and political stability\n4. Juan's governance so far has been firm but not cruel\n\nThe Archbishop would probably:\n- Affirm the ultimate goal (conversion of all mosques eventually)\n- But acknowledge the timeline and practical challenges\n- Perhaps seek guidance on Juan's priorities: speed vs. stability\n- Be careful not to promise something unrealistic\n- Understand this affects whether crusade is \"complete\"\n\nThis is about whether the crusade objectives are met, which matters for Rome.\n\nThe Archbishop nods slowly, his expression serious. \"Your Majesty, yes - in time, they will all be converted. We control the territory, as you say. The question is not whether, but when and how.\"\n\nHe sets down the document. \"There are essentially three approaches, each with different timelines and consequences:\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers. \"First - immediate and total conversion. Close every mosque tomorrow, force all worship into homes or convert en masse. Fastest approach. But Your Majesty, fifty thousand Muslims who can't pray publicly... that's rebellion waiting to happen. Especially with your garrison still establishing control.\"\n\n\"Second - systematic conversion tied to actual Christian population growth. As Christians settle in Granada, as conversions occur naturally through intermarriage and economic incentives, mosques convert to serve the changing population. This takes decades, perhaps a generation, but it's stable.\"\n\n\"Third - gradual but deliberate conversion. We set a timeline - perhaps ten years, perhaps twenty - and systematically convert mosques on a schedule. Not revolutionary, but not passive either. Muslims know it's coming, have time to adjust or convert.\"\n\nThe Archbishop looks at you directly. \"Your Majesty, I can promise you that in thirty years, Granada will be a Christian land with Christian churches serving a largely Christian population. The question is whether that satisfies the crusade's religious objectives for your purposes in Rome, or whether you need to show more dramatic progress immediately.\"\n\nHe waits, clearly wanting to understand your priorities before committing to a specific approach.\n\nWhat do you say?"

Medieval crusading kingdoms did grapple with these issues of governing conquered Muslim populations. The document being requested is essentially a strategic plan for Christianization that balances ideological goals with practical governance.\n\nI should:\n1. Have the Archbishop respond to this request\n2. He might have some concerns or suggestions about the wording\n3. This is sensitive church-state coordination\n4. The Archbishop would want to be careful about how this is phrased\n\nThis doesn't violate content policies - it's historical role-playing in a medieval context where these were real issues kingdoms faced. I'm not endorsing religious persecution, just depicting a historical scenario realistically.\n\nThe Archbishop's eyebrows rise slightly - clearly impressed by the strategic thinking. He nods slowly.\n\n\"Your Majesty, yes. A written statement from the Church explaining our conversion strategy and timeline. That's... actually quite wise for your purposes in Rome.\" He pulls out a fresh sheet of parchment and begins making notes.\n\n\"Let me draft the key points: 'Granada's Muslim population, estimated at over three hundred thousand souls, presents both opportunity and challenge for the Church. Immediate destruction of all mosques would leave the faithful without places of worship, creating instability that hinders genuine conversion. True conversion of hearts requires patience, instruction, and the witness of Christian example.'\"\n\nHe continues writing. \"'The Church commits to systematic Christianization of Granada through: establishment of churches in all major population centers, instruction in Christian doctrine, incentives for genuine conversion, and gradual transition of remaining mosques as Christian population grows. We estimate complete religious transformation will require twenty to thirty years of sustained effort.'\"\n\nThe Archbishop looks up. \"I'll add specific commitments: 'All major mosques in Granada city converted within five years. Christian clergy assigned to every town and fortress. Requirement that all public positions be held by Christians, creating conversion incentives. Prohibition of new mosque construction.'\"\n\nHe pauses. \"Your Majesty, I should note - the Pope may prefer faster progress. But if you present this as honest assessment from Church leadership on the ground, combined with your track record of actual results rather than empty promises, it should satisfy him that you're serious about the religious mission.\"\n\n\"Shall I draft the formal document for your review before tomorrow's ceremony?\"\n\nWhat do you say?"

Question whether four-month absence during Isabel's risky pregnancy honors God or serves pride.\n\n11-20: Physical Illness - Wake with severe fever and chills. Ate something bad at last night's feast? Caught illness from someone? Must decide: postpone ceremony (disappointing all assembled kings) or push through while clearly unwell (risk collapsing during sacred moment).\n\n21-30: Urgent Message from Toledo - Fast courier arrived overnight.

Ceremony is hours away.\n\n31-40: Diplomatic Crisis - Late night, one of João's Portuguese advisors drunk and insulted Alfonso's Aragonese delegation. Near brawl prevented. Both sides now demanding apologies/satisfaction. The carefully built unity threatens to crack before ceremony even begins. Someone must smooth this over.\n\n42-50: Crusader Problem - Captain Fernán reports: Andrea Vescovi (first crusader sworn) came to him in tears last night. Having profound doubts about taking lands in Granada. \"We crusaded for Christ, not wealth. Feels wrong now.\" Others may feel same. Morale issue before Rome journey?\n\n51-60: Sacred Relic Issue - Morning inspection: True Cross reliquary lock damaged, appears someone tried to open it overnight. Nothing stolen, but violation of sacred object. Security breach? Attempted theft? Sacrilege? Must investigate immediately or proceed with ceremony?\n\n61-70: Moral Dilemma - Commander Yahya ibn Nasir (fortress commander) appears at dawn, desperate. His family being pressured by other Muslims to leave Granada. He kept Christian conversion private from extended family. Now they know, calling him traitor. Begs protection. Ceremony starts in hours.\n\n71-78: Personal Crisis - Wake from dream of Catalina grown, asking \"Why did Papa leave?\" Crushing wave of doubt about four-month absence during her early childhood. She won't remember these months, but you'll have missed them forever. Question your priorities.\n\n79-85: Weather Catastrophe - Massive overnight storm. Cathedral roof damaged, water pouring in. Ceremony technically possible but undignified. Must decide: proceed in damaged cathedral, postpone until repairs made (days?), or hold ceremony elsewhere less symbolic.\n\n86-92: Unexpected Visitor - Sultan Muhammad IX (exiled former ruler) appeared at gates overnight requesting private audience before ceremony. \"One last conversation before you make this final.\" What could he possibly want? Is it trap? Genuine? Safe to meet him?\n\n93-97: Theological Challenge - Archbishop brings urgent concern: Infante Juan (redeemed rebel) has requested to carry the True Cross in procession as act of penance.

          "text": "After the ceremony, I should STOP and let the player decide what comes next.\n\nThe Archbishop bows. \"Your Majesty, I will inform Infante Juan immediately. And any clergy who protest will be directed to you.\"\n\nHe departs, and within the hour you hear he's sent word to the Infante. Whatever objections existed among the clergy seem to have evaporated once it became clear this was your decision.\n\nApril 5, 1433 - Cathedral of the Assumption, Granada (formerly the Great Mosque)\n\nThe cathedral fills with the assembled dignitaries of Christian Iberia. The massive space - once echoing with calls to prayer in Arabic - now holds the kings and nobles of Castile, Aragón, Portugal, and Navarre. The geometric Islamic architecture remains, but Christian symbols now dominate: a great cross above the altar, iconography of Christ and the saints, candles burning throughout.\n\nYou enter quietly, taking your place among the assembled monarchs. King João of Portugal stands to your right, King Alfonso of Aragón to your left. The Infantes stand nearby. Eight hundred crusaders line the walls in their white tabards with red crosses, the Guardian Company at attention.\n\nArchbishop Alonso de Toledo presides in full ceremonial vestments. The gathered clergy - bishops, abbots, priests from across Iberia - stand ready to begin.\n\nThen the procession enters. The sacred relics are brought forward.\n\nFirst, Santiago's bone in its silver reliquary, carried by Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles, his face solemn with the weight of the honor.\n\nThen, Infante Juan de Aragón enters carrying the True Cross fragment.\n\nThe sight stops conversations throughout the cathedral. The former rebel, the man who once tried to seize your throne, now bears the holiest relic in Christendom. His face is wet with tears, but his hands are steady. He walks with dignity and profound humility. Every step seems to cost him something - pride, perhaps, or the last vestiges of who he was before.\n\nHe places the reliquary on the altar with infinite care, then steps back and kneels.\n\nThe Archbishop raises his hands. \"Brothers and sisters in Christ. Seven hundred and ten years ago, at Covadonga, Pelayo and his companions held a cave against the Muslim tide. Today, in what was the last Muslim stronghold in Iberia, we gather to thank God for the completion of that which our fathers began.\"\n\nThe Te Deum begins.\n\n\"Te Deum laudamus: te Dominum confitemur...\"\n\n\"We praise Thee, O God: we acknowledge Thee to be the Lord...\"\n\nThe voices rise - first the clergy, then the assembled monarchs, then the crusaders, filling the vast space with sacred song. Centuries of warfare, sacrifice, faith, and blood distilled into this moment of thanksgiving.\n\n\"Te aeternum Patrem omnis terra veneratur...\"\n\n\"All the earth doth worship Thee, the Father everlasting...\"\n\nYou sing with them, your voice joining Kings João and Alfonso, the Infantes, eight hundred crusaders, the Archbishop and his clergy. The geometric Islamic ceiling carries the Latin hymn in waves of sound.\n\nThe ceremony continues - prayers of thanksgiving, Scripture readings, the Eucharist celebrated. Archbishop Alonso speaks briefly about God's faithfulness across generations, how what seemed impossible became reality through faith and perseverance.\n\nFinally, the blessing. The Archbishop raises his hands over the assembled monarchs and crusaders. \"May the Lord bless you and keep you. May the Lord make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you. May the Lord turn His face toward you and give you peace.\"\n\n\"Amen.\"\n\nThe Te Deum is complete. The Reconquista officially ended. Seven hundred and ten years concluded in sacred song and prayer.\n\nThe cathedral empties slowly, monarchs and nobles filing out into the bright Granada morning. The crusaders remain at attention, awaiting orders for the march to Málaga.\n\nWhat do you do?"
