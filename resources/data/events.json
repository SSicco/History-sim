          "text": "The Kingdom of Castile - Spring 1430\n\nYou stand in the royal chambers of your palace, perhaps in Valladolid or Segovia, as the spring light filters through narrow windows. Around you, the trappings of kingship: tapestries bearing the castle and lion of your realm, the weight of the crown you have worn since infancy but only now truly command.\n\nYour chamberlain, secretaries, and the ever-present Álvaro de Luna - your Constable and closest confidant - gather as you call for reports on the state of your kingdom.\n\nKINGDOM STATUS\n\nTreasury: Strained but functional\nYour revenues from royal taxes, customs duties, and crown lands provide approximately 30 million maravedís annually, but noble tax exemptions and the costs of maintaining royal authority drain much of this. The Hermandad (urban militias) and various towns contribute funds, but you lack the financial power of France or Aragon.\n\nMilitary Strength: Moderate and divided\nYour standing forces are limited - perhaps 3,000 royal men-at-arms and crossbowmen directly loyal to the crown. However, you can call upon feudal levies from nobles and military orders (Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara), theoretically raising 15,000-20,000 troops... if the nobles comply. The frontier with Granada maintains permanent garrisons.\n\nNoble Loyalty: CRITICAL CONCERN\nThis is your greatest challenge, Your Majesty. The great noble houses are restless:\n\nThe Infantes de Aragón (Princes Juan and Enrique, your cousins from Aragon) hold vast estates in Castile and command fierce loyalty from many nobles. They resent Álvaro de Luna's influence over you and seek to control the crown themselves.\n\nThe Mendoza family - relatively loyal, for now\n\nThe Manrique, Estúñiga, and Velasco families - watching carefully, ready to side with whoever offers them more power\n\nThe Master of Santiago and other military orders - powerful and semi-autonomous\n\nMany nobles see you as young and untested, and they remember the regency conflicts of your minority. They test boundaries constantly.\n\nPopular Support: Cautiously positive\nThe common people know little of court intrigues. They care about bread prices, protection from bandits, and whether their lord is just. You are their anointed king, which grants you sacred authority in their eyes, but they suffer under noble exactions and pray for strong royal justice.\n\nForeign Relations:\n\nAragon: Your cousin, King Alfonso V (\"the Magnanimous\"), rules to the east. Relations are tense - his brothers, the Infantes, meddle constantly in your realm, and Aragon eyes Castilian weakness hungrily. The question of Navarra also complicates matters.\n\nGranada: The Nasrid Kingdom under Sultan Muhammad IX pays you parias (tribute) for peace, but the Reconquista simmers. Both war and peace factions exist in your court. A campaign could unite fractious nobles behind you... or expose weaknesses.\n\nPortugal: King João I is aging but his realm is stable. Relations are correct but cool. The Portuguese remember past Castilian claims.\n\nFrance: Distant but watching. The Hundred Years' War occupies them, but French diplomacy is always active.\n\nIMMEDIATE CONCERNS\n\n1. Álvaro de Luna's Position\nYour Constable has extraordinary power - he essentially governs in your name. He is capable, loyal to you personally, and has kept the realm from chaos during your minority. But the nobles despise him as a low-born upstart (his family is minor nobility at best). They demand you dismiss him and rule \"in consultation with your natural counselors\" - meaning them. This is the defining political question of your reign.\n\n2. The Infantes' Machinations\nWord reaches you that the Infantes de Aragón are gathering supporters, holding meetings at their estates. They whisper that you are a puppet of Luna, that true Castilian nobles should have their proper place. Some speak of forcing a regency council upon you \"for the kingdom's good.\"\n\n3. Economic Pressures\nSeveral towns petition for tax relief after poor harvests. The nobles resist any attempt to reduce their own privileges or contribute more to royal coffers.\n\n4. The Granada Question\nYour frontier commanders report skirmishes. Some hot-headed nobles want a grand campaign to seize more territory and win glory. The Archbishop of Toledo preaches crusade. But would this unite your nobles behind you, or create opportunities for betrayal?\n\nÁlvaro de Luna approaches, his dark eyes watchful. \"Your Majesty, the realm requires your hand on the tiller. The wolves circle, but you are no longer a child to be directed by regents. What is your pleasure? How shall we proceed?\"\n\nSeveral sealed letters await your attention on a table - reports from Seville, Toledo, the frontier, and one bearing the seal of the Infante Juan de Aragón himself.\n\nWhat do you do, Your Majesty?"

Frontier reports - Granada border situation\n4. Letter from Infante Juan de Aragón - the political challenge\n\nI should make these feel authentic - medieval letter style, appropriate concerns, realistic details that give the player meaningful choices.\n\nYou dismiss the others with a gesture, keeping only Álvaro de Luna nearby as you break the seals and unfold the parchments. The Constable stands at a respectful distance, hands clasped, watching your face as you read.\n\nLETTER FROM SEVILLE\n\nFrom Pedro Fernández de Velasco, your appointed corregidor (royal magistrate) in Seville\n\nThe letter is respectfully worded but carries an undercurrent of concern:\n\n\"Most Serene and Catholic Majesty,\n\nI write to inform Your Grace of matters requiring royal attention in this your loyal city of Seville.\n\nThe grain harvests of the Guadalquivir valley have proven adequate, thanks be to God, and trade through our port continues profitable. The customs revenues I have dispatched to Your Majesty's treasury amount to 420,000 maravedís for this quarter.\n\nHowever, I must report discord among the noble houses. The Guzmán family (Counts of Niebla) and the Ponce de León family continue their ancient feud with increasing boldness. Last month, armed retainers clashed in the streets near the Cathedral. Three men died, and the city watch proved insufficient to prevent it. Each family blames the other and appeals to Your Majesty for judgment.\n\nMore troubling still: I have evidence that Don Enrique, Infante of Aragón, has been corresponding with certain nobles of the city, and gold from Aragón has reached their coffers. They gather in the Alcázar district and speak of 'proper counsel' for Your Majesty and 'the natural order of the kingdom.' I cannot prove conspiracy, but the signs concern me.\n\nThe merchant guilds petition Your Majesty to reduce tariffs on wool exports to Flanders, claiming it would increase trade and thus your revenues. The nobles who own the sheep lands oppose this, desiring higher prices.\n\nI await Your Majesty's wisdom in these matters. The city remains yours, but a firm hand would reassure the loyal.\n\nYour Majesty's faithful servant,\nPedro Fernández de Velasco\"\n\nLETTER FROM TOLEDO\n\nFrom the Archbishop of Toledo, Juan Martínez de Contreras\n\nWritten in an elegant clerical hand with Latin phrases interspersed:\n\n\"To Our Most Catholic and Serene Lord, Juan II, by Grace of God King of Castile and León,\n\nDivine Providence has placed upon your shoulders the sacred duty of defending Holy Mother Church and extending Christian dominion over the lands held by the infidel. I write both as your Archbishop and as a voice for many of your realm who look to their King for leadership in righteousness.\n\nThe Kingdom of Granada festers on our southern border—a Mohammedan realm that should by rights be Christian soil. Sultan Muhammad gathers strength while we hesitate. The recent skirmishes on the frontier are signs that God calls us to action.\n\nI propose that Your Majesty proclaim a Crusade this very year. The Holy Father in Rome would surely grant indulgences. Such a campaign would:\n\nWin glory for the Crown and redemption for Christian souls\n\nUnite your nobles in common purpose under royal banner\n\nSeize tribute and territory from the Moors\n\nDemonstrate your kingship through decisive action\n\nHowever, I must also report matters of faith within your realm. The conversos (Jewish converts to Christianity) of Toledo grow wealthy and prominent, holding positions in city government and even Church offices. This causes resentment among Old Christians who question the sincerity of these conversions. I urge temperance and careful oversight.\n\nFurthermore, certain nobles have been less than diligent in their tithes to the Church. The faith requires the support of the faithful, particularly those of high station.\n\nI remain Your Majesty's most humble servant in Christ,\nArchbishop Juan Martínez de Contreras\"\n\nFRONTIER REPORT\n\nFrom the Adelantado (military governor) of the frontier, Íñigo López de Mendoza\n\nA soldier's brief, direct report:\n\n\"Your Majesty,\n\nThe frontier holds but grows restless. The Moors of Granada test our positions monthly with raiding parties. Last week they struck near Alcalá la Real, seizing cattle and burning two villages. We pursued and killed perhaps twenty of them, recovering some livestock.\n\nOur garrisons are adequate if we maintain defensive posture, but insufficient for offensive operations. The castles of Alcalá, Jaén, and the border fortresses require repairs and supplies that strain local resources.\n\nThe Military Orders (Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara) maintain their own frontier positions and coordinate poorly with royal forces. Their Masters act as independent princes, acknowledging your authority in words but not always deeds.\n\nI hear rumors that certain nobles advocate for major campaign against Granada. With respect, Your Majesty, such an endeavor would require:\n\n15,000-20,000 troops maintained for months\n\nSiege equipment and supplies\n\nCoordination among nobles who currently mistrust each other\n\nSignificant treasury expenditure\n\nDone well, it could seize Málaga or even pressure Granada's capital. Done poorly, it could become a disaster that emboldens the Moors and embarrasses the Crown.\n\nThe frontier awaits your command.\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza, Adelantado\"\n\nLETTER FROM INFANTE JUAN DE ARAGÓN\n\nThe seal shows the arms of Aragón with personal marks. The handwriting is confident, almost presumptuous:\n\n\"To Our Dearest Cousin, King Juan of Castile,\n\nGreetings from your kinsman and devoted cousin.\n\nI write with fraternal concern for your person and your realm. It brings me pain to hear whispers from Castile that all is not well—that the natural counselors of your kingdom, the great lords whose families have served the Crown for generations, find themselves excluded from your presence by the... ambitions of certain low-born individuals.\n\nYour Majesty, you are young still, and youth brings vigor but also requires the guidance of experienced men of noble blood. I fear that Álvaro de Luna, however capable he may be in small matters, lacks the breeding and wisdom to guide a kingdom. His monopoly on your favor creates resentment and instability.\n\nI offer, as your kinsman, to visit your court and provide counsel. My brother Enrique and I have only your interests at heart. Many of your nobles—good men, loyal to the Crown—have expressed to us their desire to see proper governance restored.\n\nConsider: would it not be wise to rule in consultation with a council of your greatest nobles? To show that you value their ancient rights and wisdom? This would strengthen your crown, not weaken it.\n\nI await your response and pray for your health and wisdom.\n\nYour devoted cousin,\nJuan, Infante of Aragón, King of Navarra\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna clears his throat softly. You look up from the letters to find his expression dark.\n\n\"Your Majesty has read the Infante's letter, I presume?\" His voice is carefully controlled. \"Honeyed words wrapped around a dagger. He speaks of 'counsel' but means 'control.' He and his brother seek to make you a puppet king while they rule Castile through a noble council of their creatures.\"\n\nHe steps closer, his intensity breaking through his usual calculated demeanor. \"Sire, you must understand—if you yield to these demands, if you dismiss me and accept their 'counsel,' you will never rule this kingdom in truth. They will manage you as they managed you during the regency, making decisions in your name while you sign what they place before you.\"\n\nHe pauses, seeming to choose his next words carefully. \"But I am not blind to the danger. The Infantes gather support. Seville shows signs of their gold and influence. If we move carelessly, they could raise rebellion under the banner of 'rescuing the King from evil counsel.' We need a strategy, Your Majesty. But first, I must know—do you intend to rule, or to be ruled?\"\n\nWhat do you do?"

          "text": "1. **Council control** - If they establish a formal council of nobles, they could:\n   - Control what information reaches the king\n   - Require the king to consult them on major decisions\n   - Frame themselves as the \"legitimate\" voice of the kingdom\n   - Use their collective weight to pressure/intimidate\n\n2. **Physical control** - This could include:\n   - Controlling access to the king (who sees him, when, where)\n   - Controlling his household and servants\n   - Potentially even \"protective custody\" if things escalate\n   - Control of royal castles and residences\n\n3. **Institutional control** - Through:\n   - Appointments to key positions\n   - Control of treasury\n   - Command of military forces\n   - Regional governance\n\n4. **Legitimacy narratives** - They would:\n   - Frame themselves as protecting proper governance\n   - Present the king as needing guidance due to youth\n   - Portray Luna as the problem, not them\n   - Use their ancient lineages as justification\n\nÁlvaro de Luna would be the perfect character to explain this, as he's lived through the regency period and knows exactly how this works. I should have him give concrete, historical examples of how this played out during Juan's minority and what the Infantes are likely planning.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna's expression becomes grimmer, almost professorial, as he recognizes your question as crucial. He gestures for you to sit, and he remains standing, pacing slightly as he explains.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the right question. Let me be blunt about how this works—I watched it happen throughout your minority, and the Infantes mean to recreate it now that you've come of age.\"\n\nHe counts off on his fingers:\n\nInformation Control\n\n\"First, they control what you know. A council of nobles would insist that all reports, letters, petitions—everything—pass through them first. They 'review' these documents, deciding what deserves Your Majesty's attention and what does not.\n\nThat letter from Seville mentioning Infante Enrique's gold? A noble council would ensure you never saw it. They would summarize: 'Seville is peaceful, minor noble disputes, nothing requiring Your Majesty's concern.'\n\nThey would control access to your person. Want to speak with the Adelantado from the frontier directly? 'No need to trouble Your Majesty—we have spoken with him and can provide counsel.' Want to hear from merchants or town representatives? 'Beneath your dignity, Sire—we'll handle such matters.'\n\nWithin months, you would only know what they want you to know. You'd be making decisions based on their curated version of reality.\"\n\nInstitutional Capture\n\nHe continues, his voice harder: \"Second, they demand control of appointments. The council would insist that corregidores in major cities, military governors, treasury officials—all require their 'advice and consent.'\n\nIn practice? Every position of power would go to their men, their relatives, their supporters. Pedro Fernández in Seville would be replaced by someone loyal to the Guzmáns or whoever supports the Infantes. The treasury officials would be their creatures, so they'd know—and control—every maravedí that moves.\n\nYour orders would pass through officials who owe their positions to the council, not to you. If you commanded something they dislike, it would be delayed, misunderstood, or simply ignored. 'Alas, Your Majesty, the situation proved more complex than anticipated...'\"\n\nMilitary Reality\n\n\"Third—and this is where it becomes dangerous—they control force. The great nobles command far more troops than the Crown directly controls. You saw the numbers: you have perhaps 3,000 men directly loyal to you. The Mendozas alone can field 2,000. The Infantes, through their supporters, could raise 10,000 or more.\n\nIf they establish a council and pack it with their supporters, they effectively command the realm's military power. Want to suppress a rebellion? You'd need to ask them for troops. Want to enforce a decision they dislike? With what army, Your Majesty?\n\nDuring your minority, the Infantes actually held castles and fortresses that belonged to the Crown. They claimed to be 'safeguarding' them. Getting those back required years and, in some cases, sieges.\"\n\nThe Physical Element\n\nHe stops pacing and faces you directly, his voice dropping:\n\n\"And yes, Your Majesty, there can be a physical element. During the worst of the regency conflicts, there were times when the Infantes and their allies essentially held you—always under the fiction of 'protecting' you or 'proper attendance on Your Majesty's person.'\n\nThey would control your household: your guards, your servants, your chamberlains—all their men. They would decide where you reside: 'For security, Your Majesty should stay at Madrigal' or wherever suits their purposes, in a castle where they control the garrison.\n\nThey would control who enters your presence. Want to meet with me? 'Álvaro de Luna is unavailable today, perhaps later.' Want to speak with a loyal noble? 'He has been called away on urgent business.' Meanwhile, their men would have constant access to you—advising, suggesting, framing every issue their way.\n\nIt wouldn't be a dungeon, Your Majesty. You would still be called King. You'd still wear the crown and sign documents. You'd live in comfort, surrounded by ceremony and respect. But every decision would be 'guided.' Every action would require their 'counsel.' Every initiative would be subject to their approval.\"\n\nThe Mechanism of Consent\n\nHe leans forward, intense: \"Here's the clever part—they would make you complicit in your own powerlessness. They would bring you documents to sign, decisions to approve, appointments to confirm. Each one, taken individually, would seem reasonable. Skilled advisors would explain why each choice is wise.\n\nYou'd sign. You'd approve. And each signature would deepen their control and make it harder to break free. 'But Your Majesty agreed to this council structure.' 'Your Majesty approved these appointments.' 'Your Majesty signed this charter limiting royal authority.'\n\nThey'd use your own royal authority to bind you.\"\n\nHistorical Example\n\nHe straightens: \"During your minority, there was a period—Your Majesty was perhaps twelve—when the Infante Enrique essentially controlled your household. You resided at Tordesillas, surrounded by his men. Your mother, Queen Catherine, was kept from you. I was barred from court.\n\nEvery day, Enrique would attend you at meals, during prayers, during recreation. Always respectful, always deferential, always calling you 'Your Majesty.' But when you expressed a desire contrary to his plans, there was always a reason why it couldn't be done, why you needed to wait, why his alternative was wiser.\n\nIt took a coalition of other nobles—ironically including some who now oppose me—to 'rescue' you from that situation. They didn't do it for love of you, but because they wanted control themselves.\"\n\nThe Current Threat\n\n\"Now the Infantes smell opportunity again. You've come of age and begun personal rule, but they see you as young, untested, and too reliant on me—one man they cannot control. Their plan is clear:\n\nPressure you to dismiss me or at least dilute my authority\n\nEstablish a formal council that must be consulted on major decisions\n\nPack that council with their supporters\n\nGradually expand the council's powers until it becomes the real government\n\nEventually, make these arrangements permanent through charters and laws you'll be pressured to grant\n\nThe letter from the Infante Juan is step one—a 'friendly' offer to help, painting me as the problem. If you accept, they'll have won without raising a single banner in rebellion.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds quietly: \"Your Majesty, I am not arguing for my own position out of personal ambition. If you wish to rule directly, to build your own council of men you trust, to rely less on me—that is your right as King, and I would support it.\n\nBut that is different from surrendering power to the Infantes and their faction. One path leads to your authority. The other leads to becoming a ceremonial king who reigns but does not rule.\"\n\nHe falls silent, watching your face.\n\nThe question implicit in the air: How do you wish to respond to these threats? What is your strategy?"

He straightens immediately, his soldier's instincts engaging.\n\n\"Your Majesty speaks like a king,\" he says with fierce satisfaction. \"Now let us make you secure like one.\"\n\nYour Current Location\n\n\"We are in the Royal Palace of Valladolid, Your Majesty—your primary residence these past months. Specifically, we're in your private chambers in the eastern tower. There are three ways in: the main door to the presence chamber, a servant's entrance through the antechamber, and a stairway leading down to the royal apartments below.\"\n\nHe moves to the main door and opens it slightly, glancing out.\n\n\"In the presence chamber beyond, there are currently six people:\n\nTwo of your chamberlains\n\nA secretary\n\nThree petitioners waiting for audience\n\nYour guards at the outer doors\"\n\nYour Immediate Household - Who Can You Trust?\n\nÁlvaro closes the door and turns back to you, speaking rapidly but clearly:\n\nDEFINITELY LOYAL:\n\n\"Myself - Your Majesty knows my position. I rise or fall with you.\n\nFernán Alonso de Robles - Captain of your royal guard here in Valladolid. He's a minor knight from Extremadura, owes everything to the crown, no ties to the great houses. He commands thirty men-at-arms directly guarding this palace. I appointed him myself two years ago. He's solid.\n\nRodrigo de Luna - My nephew, yes, but more importantly your repostero mayor (head of your household). He controls access to your private chambers and manages your personal servants. He's in the apartments below right now.\n\nPedro de Estúñiga - Your justicia mayor (chief justice). Surprisingly, despite his family name, he's been loyal to royal authority. He's currently at the royal courts in the city, about fifteen minutes away by horse.\"\n\nPROBABLY LOYAL:\n\n\"Most of your household guards - The thirty men under Fernán Alonso. They're paid directly from the royal treasury, they eat your bread, and they've taken oaths to your person. That said, a few might have ties to greater lords—it's impossible to avoid entirely.\n\nYour household servants - The immediate ones who serve you daily. Minor people, but they know the palace and who comes and goes.\"\n\nQUESTIONABLE:\n\n\"The two chamberlains in the presence chamber - Both are from middling noble families. One, García Fernández de Manrique, has cousins who correspond with the Infantes. The other, Juan de Silva, seems devoted to ceremony and protocol above all else. Neither would likely act against you directly, but they gossip and might report to others.\n\nThe secretary - A cleric appointed by the Archbishop of Toledo. Probably reports everything to the Church, which means it gets to the Archbishop.\"\n\nPOTENTIAL THREATS:\n\n\"The garrison of Valladolid itself - About 200 men commanded by the Count of Benavente, who holds the castle. The Count is... cautious. He bends with the wind. Right now he pays you respect, but if the Infantes arrived with an army, I wouldn't wager my life on his loyalty.\n\nVarious nobles currently in Valladolid - At least a dozen are in the city with their retinues. Some are here for legitimate business, others are watching and waiting. Total armed men in the city not under your direct control: perhaps 400-500.\"\n\nImmediate Action Available\n\nÁlvaro steps closer, lowering his voice: \"Your Majesty, if you wish to secure your person right now, here's what we can do immediately:\n\nWithin the hour:\n\nI summon Captain Fernán Alonso here, confirm his loyalty personally with you, and order him to allow NO ONE into your private chambers without your explicit command or mine\n\nMy nephew Rodrigo locks down access from below\n\nWe dismiss the questionable chamberlains from immediate service—send them on 'missions' elsewhere\n\nWe move loyal guards to all three entrances to these chambers\n\nToday:\n\nSend fast riders to summon Pedro de Estúñiga and other loyal officials to the palace\n\nQuietly assess which of the palace garrison we can truly count on\n\nBegin identifying which nobles currently in Valladolid are reliable and which are watching for the Infantes\n\nThis week:\n\nWe can relocate you to a more secure location if needed—perhaps Segovia, where the fortress is directly controlled by royal appointees, or Madrid, which is smaller and easier to secure\n\nBuild up your personal guard with new recruits we vet carefully\n\nBegin replacing questionable officials systematically\"\n\nHe pauses: \"But Your Majesty, securing your person is only the first step. The Infantes won't attempt to take you by force while you're alert and protected—that would be open rebellion. Their method is subtler: pressure, influence, political isolation.\n\nThe real question is: what do you want to do with your security once you have it? Do we go on the offensive against the Infantes? Fortify and prepare for confrontation? Seek to divide their supporters? Build alliances?\n\nYour Majesty's anger is righteous, but anger must become strategy.\"\n\nHe looks at you expectantly. \"Shall I summon Captain Fernán Alonso immediately? And what broader strategy do you wish to pursue?\"\n\nWhat do you do?"

Information is power, and you need eyes and ears beyond mine. Let me suggest several men who could serve this purpose—each brings different strengths.\"\n\nHe begins ticking off names, describing each carefully:\n\nFOR INTELLIGENCE GATHERING IN COURT\n\n\"Diego Gómez de Sandoval, Count of Castro\"\n\n\"Age thirty-two. Middling noble house, but clever as a serpent. He fought in the Granada campaigns and knows how to read men. More importantly, he's a converso—his grandfather was Jewish and converted. This means the great old families look down on him slightly, which makes him hungry to prove himself and dependent on royal favor rather than ancient bloodlines.\n\nStrengths: Excellent at reading social dynamics, has connections among the converso community (which includes many wealthy merchants and officials who could be useful), personally brave.\n\nRisks: Some Old Christians distrust conversos. The Archbishop mentioned them in his letter—there's always that tension. But that very vulnerability makes him reliable to you.\"\n\n\"Íñigo López de Mendoza\" (not the Adelantado, his younger cousin)\n\n\"Age twenty-three, about your age, Your Majesty. Younger son of the Mendoza family, which means he has the family name but won't inherit their main estates. He's a poet, actually—writes rather good verse—but don't let that fool you. He's sharp, educated, and observant.\n\nStrengths: The Mendoza connection gives him access to high noble circles, but as a younger son he needs to make his own way. He can move among the great families as one of them while actually serving you. Intelligent, cultured, could handle diplomatic missions.\n\nRisks: His family might pressure him if they turn against you. But right now the Mendozas are relatively loyal, and younger sons often become the crown's best servants—they have something to prove.\"\n\nFOR URBAN INTELLIGENCE & COMMON FOLK\n\n\"Juan de Daza\"\n\n\"Age forty. A commoner—son of a merchant from Burgos who became a lawyer and then entered royal service. Currently serves as a minor treasury official here in Valladolid. He knows how to listen, how to piece together information from customs records, merchant gossip, and city taverns.\n\nStrengths: No noble connections mean no divided loyalties. He understands commerce, money flows, and the concerns of towns and merchants. Could track where gold is moving—like that Aragonese money in Seville. Invisible to nobles who don't notice 'little people.'\n\nRisks: Nobles would sneer at your relying on a commoner for important matters. But that's exactly why he's useful—he operates below their notice.\"\n\nFOR THE CHURCH & CLERICAL NETWORKS\n\n\"Lope de Barrientos\"\n\n\"A Dominican friar, about forty-five, currently teaching at the University of Salamanca. Brilliant theologian, but more importantly, he has connections throughout the clerical network—priests, monks, bishops all over Castile. The Church is its own intelligence network; they hear confessions and travel everywhere.\n\nStrengths: Access to Church networks without being beholden to the Archbishop of Toledo. Educated, discreet, and frankly more interested in learning and royal service than ecclesiastical politics. Could counter the Archbishop's influence.\n\nRisks: He's not political by nature—would need guidance. But his loyalty would be to learning and order, which means royal authority.\"\n\nFOR MILITARY & FRONTIER MATTERS\n\n\"Rodrigo Manrique\"\n\n\"Age twenty-eight. From the Manrique family, yes, but hear me out—he's a younger son who's spent the last decade on the Granada frontier. He's a soldier first, political operative second. The frontier breeds practical men who value competence over court intrigue.\n\nStrengths: Understanding of military matters, connections along the entire frontier, respected by fighting men. The Manriques are a large clan—some support the Infantes, some don't. He could help you navigate which branches are reliable.\n\nRisks: His family name cuts both ways. But soldiers tend to be direct—easier to read than courtiers.\"\n\nÁlvaro's Summary\n\nHe leans back: \"Your Majesty, I would suggest starting with perhaps three or four of these men—enough for different perspectives, not so many that coordination becomes difficult.\n\nMy recommendation for an initial group:\n\n1. Diego Gómez de Sandoval - Your primary observer of court dynamics and noble factions here in Valladolid\n\n2. Juan de Daza - To track money, urban sentiment, and merchant networks. Information the nobles don't think about.\n\n3. One of the younger nobles - Either the Mendoza or the Manrique, depending on whether you want emphasis on diplomatic finesse or military/frontier intelligence.\n\nYou could add Lope de Barrientos later if we need to counter the Archbishop's ecclesiastical influence.\"\n\nHe pauses: \"These men would report directly to you—not through me, though I could help coordinate if you wish. The key is that you would know what they know, not receive it filtered through me or anyone else.\n\nWe'd need to approach each carefully. Make it clear you're offering them opportunity to serve the Crown directly, which is prestigious. Frame it as your expanding your direct governance—not as building a spy network, even though that's partly what it is.\"\n\nHe looks at you: \"Does this align with what Your Majesty had in mind? Should I arrange discreet meetings with any of these men? And how do you want to structure their roles—formal appointments or informal understanding?\"\n\nWhat do you think of these suggestions? How do you want to proceed?"

The dice rolls would come when:\n1. Testing each person's loyalty/reaction during the meetings\n2. When they go on their assignments\n3. When consequences unfold from these decisions\n\nSo right now, I should:\n1. Acknowledge this is a good plan\n2. Describe the logistics of summoning these people\n3. Explain how long it will take to gather them\n4. Then set up the first meeting\n\nThe player said they have plans for everyone and want to talk individually. So I should prepare to have the first person arrive and let the player conduct that conversation, then we'll go through each one.\n\nLet me think about timing:\n- Diego Gómez de Sandoval - probably in or near Valladolid, could arrive within a day or two\n- Íñigo López de Mendoza - might be at family estates, could take 3-5 days\n- Juan de Daza - in Valladolid as a treasury official, could come today\n- Lope de Barrientos - at Salamanca University, about 2-3 days travel\n- Rodrigo Manrique - on the frontier or at family estates, could take a week\n\nI should present this to the player and then start with whoever arrives first.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna's face lights up with fierce satisfaction. \"Now this is kingship, Your Majesty.\" He stands immediately, already mentally organizing.\n\n\"I'll dispatch messengers within the hour. Let me outline the timing—some of these men can be here quickly, others will take days.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\nSUMMONING TIMELINE\n\nJuan de Daza - \"He's here in Valladolid at the treasury offices. I can have him at the palace within two hours if Your Majesty wishes to begin today.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval - \"The Count of Castro is at his estates about thirty miles northeast. A fast rider reaches him tonight, he could be here by tomorrow evening or the morning after.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos - \"Salamanca is perhaps sixty miles south. Two days' travel, possibly three depending on roads and weather. Call it three or four days until he arrives.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza - \"I believe he's currently at the Mendoza estates in Guadalajara. That's about a hundred miles—four or five days if he rides promptly upon receiving your summons.\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique - \"This one is uncertain. He could be on the frontier near Jaén, which is a week's journey, or at the Manrique family seat in Paredes de Nava, which is only two days. I'll send riders to both locations. Expect anywhere from three days to ten, depending on where we find him.\"\n\nHe begins drafting instructions in his mind: \"The summonses will be worded carefully—'His Majesty requests your counsel on urgent matters of the realm' or similar. Honorable, nothing that suggests suspicion or desperation, but clear that you expect prompt attendance.\n\nFor those who are further away, this also serves another purpose—we'll see how quickly they respond and what excuses, if any, they make. That itself tells us something about their eagerness to serve.\"\n\nHe pauses: \"Your Majesty, shall I have Juan de Daza brought here this very afternoon? You could begin your first meeting today, while we wait for the others to arrive. It would also let you practice reading a man's loyalty and giving assignments—he's the least politically dangerous to start with, since he's a commoner with no powerful family behind him.\"\n\nÁlvaro moves toward the door, then stops: \"One more thing, Your Majesty. How do you want these meetings structured?\n\nShould I be present to observe and provide context, or would you prefer to meet each man entirely alone to demonstrate your independence and encourage their candor?\n\nAnd should we bring them in through the public chambers where others will notice, or use the private stairway for discretion? The first shows you openly building a new council—bold but potentially alarming to the Infantes. The second keeps your plans hidden but might seem furtive.\"\n\nHe awaits your decision on these details before dispatching the messengers.\n\nWhat are your preferences for the meeting structure and timing?"

Have Álvaro react to this bold move\n5. Set the stage for whatever the king wants to do with the assembled guards\n\nThis is the king beginning to take direct control and assert his authority. Very good roleplaying.\n\nÁlvaro nods sharply. \"As Your Majesty commands. I'll begin dispatching the messengers immediately.\"\n\nHe moves to open the door for you, and you stride through into the presence chamber. The chamberlains and petitioners look up in surprise at your sudden emergence, bowing hastily. You ignore them, walking with purpose toward the outer doors.\n\nThe guards there—two men in partial armor bearing halberds—snap to attention. \"Your Majesty!\"\n\n\"Where is Captain Fernán Alonso?\" you demand.\n\n\"In the guard quarters, Your Majesty, just across the courtyard—\"\n\nYou're already moving. Behind you, you hear Álvaro de Luna following at a respectful distance, saying nothing but clearly intrigued by your sudden action.\n\nTHE COURTYARD\n\nYou emerge from the palace into the main courtyard of the Valladolid palace complex. It's mid-morning, and the spring sun illuminates the stone walls. The courtyard is perhaps fifty paces across, with the main palace building on one side, the guard barracks on another, stables on the third, and the main gate to the street on the fourth.\n\nA few servants pause in their tasks, surprised to see their king walking unannounced across the courtyard. They bow hurriedly.\n\nYou stride toward the guard barracks—a two-story stone building with narrow windows. Before you reach it, a man emerges, clearly having been alerted by the commotion of your passage.\n\nCAPTAIN FERNÁN ALONSO DE ROBLES\n\nHe's in his mid-thirties, lean and weathered, with the look of a man who's spent years on campaign. He wears a leather jerkin over a simple tunic, a sword at his hip. His face shows surprise but he drops to one knee immediately.\n\n\"Your Majesty! I was not informed you required—\"\n\n\"Captain,\" you interrupt, \"assemble your entire guard in this courtyard. Now. Every man under your command.\"\n\nHis eyes widen slightly, then he's on his feet. \"At once, Your Majesty!\" He turns and bellows into the barracks: \"GUARDS! FULL MUSTER IN THE COURTYARD! MOVE!\"\n\nThe response is immediate. You hear boots on stone, the clatter of equipment being grabbed. Men begin pouring from the barracks—some buckling sword belts as they run, others jamming helmets on their heads.\n\nFernán Alonso turns back to you: \"Your Majesty, it will take perhaps three minutes for the full company to assemble. Some are on gate duty, others at the palace entrances—\"\n\n\"Send runners. I want every man.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sire!\" He dispatches two guards at a run toward the palace and main gate.\n\nTHE ASSEMBLY\n\nOver the next few minutes, your royal guard assembles. They form up in rough ranks in the courtyard—some clearly roused from rest, others pulled from their posts. They're a mixed group: some in full mail and helmets, others in lighter gear, a few still buckling straps.\n\nCaptain Fernán organizes them with crisp commands, getting them into proper formation. You count them as they gather: twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty... the full complement Álvaro mentioned.\n\nThey're armed with swords, some with halberds or polearms, a few with crossbows. Most wear the royal livery—tabards bearing the castle and lion of Castile. They range in age from young men barely twenty to grizzled veterans in their forties.\n\nBehind you, Álvaro de Luna stands silent, watching. A few servants and palace officials have gathered at windows and doorways, clearly wondering what's happening. Word is spreading that the King has called out his guard.\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso steps forward and salutes sharply. \"Your Majesty, the royal guard is assembled. Thirty men present and accounted for.\"\n\nThe guards stand at attention, eyes forward, clearly uncertain what this unprecedented muster means but maintaining discipline.\n\nThe courtyard is yours. Thirty armed men await your words.\n\nWhat do you say to them?"

These men are Catholic, many are genuinely devout, and framing service to the king as service to God taps into their deepest beliefs. This is arguably your strongest point.\n\nMaterial Incentives - Promising better equipment is concrete and immediate. Soldiers understand this. The royal guard should have the best gear, and if they don't currently, this promise matters.\n\nUnprecedented Access - Offering personal audience rights to common soldiers is radical. It elevates them above their station in a way that would make them fiercely loyal. No noble can offer them this.\n\nPersonal Royal Attention - The very fact that you, the anointed king, came out personally to address them is dramatic and unusual. Kings don't typically do this. It signals they matter to you personally.\n\nExpanded Role - Telling them they're more than just guards—that they're diplomats, eyes and ears—makes them feel special and trusted. Men want to feel important.\n\nTheir Captain Is Loyal - Fernán Alonso's body language and response will influence the men. If he's clearly moved or approving, they'll follow his lead.\n\nCurrent Circumstances - They're already on the royal payroll, they've taken oaths, and there's no immediate counter-pressure from nobles trying to bribe them away.\n\nFactors Working Against You:\n\nYour Youth and Inexperience - You're 18 and just beginning personal rule. You haven't proven yourself yet in battle, politics, or crisis. Words are one thing; demonstrated competence is another. Some harder men might be skeptical.\n\nThe \"Not Here To Fight\" Phrasing - This might land oddly. Soldiers fundamentally understand their role as fighting men. Telling them they're \"not here to fight\" as the primary message could confuse or even insult some. The expanded roles should be in addition to fighting, not instead of it.\n\nGrand Promises - Medieval soldiers have heard lords make promises before. Some of the older veterans might wonder if this is just youthful idealism that will fade when reality hits. \"Will he really grant us audience whenever we want? That seems impractical...\"\n\nLack of Immediate Threat Context - You're giving an inspiring speech, but to what end? If you'd explained there are threats to the realm or to your person that require their special loyalty, it would feel more urgent and concrete. As is, some might wonder why now.\n\nPotential Noble Ties - Among thirty men, a few probably have cousins, brothers, or fathers in service to great noble houses. Those family ties might create conflicted loyalties, especially if those nobles pressure them later.\n\nThe Egalitarian Framing - \"We are all servants\" is humble and appealing to common men, but in a hierarchical medieval society, some might find it almost too egalitarian. The social order is divinely ordained; are you undermining it?\n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT: LIKELY TO SUCCEED\n\nThis speech should work for most of these men, probably securing genuine personal loyalty from 20-25 of the 30. The religious framing is powerful, the material and status incentives are real, and your personal attention is unprecedented.\n\nHowever, you're unlikely to get all thirty as completely devoted followers. A handful might remain merely professional (doing their jobs for pay but not personally devoted), and one or two might have divided loyalties due to family ties or skepticism about your youth.\n\nThe greatest risk is if you roll badly—a catastrophic failure could make you seem like a naive boy playing at kingship, which would undermine your authority with these men and word would spread.\n\nBut the odds are in your favor. This is a good action at a good time with a reasonably compelling message.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stands silent behind you, clearly waiting to see how your words land. Captain Fernán Alonso's eyes haven't left you—his expression is intense, almost hungry, as if he wants desperately to believe in what you're saying.\n\nThe thirty guards stand at attention, listening to their king speak directly to them for perhaps the first time in their service.\n\nNow you must roll to see how successful your speech is. What is your result?"

Captain Fernán Alonso steps aside, giving you the floor.\n\nTHE SPEECH\n\nYour voice rings out across the courtyard: \"My name is Juan II, King of Castile. And I come to you, asking for your help.\"\n\nThe guards stand at attention, eyes forward. Their faces are professionally neutral—the trained blankness of soldiers listening to a superior officer.\n\nYou continue, speaking of God's purpose, of unity, of driving out heathens and building the kingdom to the heavens. The religious language is proper, expected even. The guards listen respectfully. A few nod slightly at appropriate moments—the automatic acknowledgment of piety.\n\n\"Every single one of you is not here to fight! No, you are also diplomats, courtiers, messengers, spies...\"\n\nYou see a few guards exchange the briefest of glances. It's hard to read—confusion? Skepticism? The moment passes quickly as discipline reasserts itself.\n\nAs you promise better equipment and the right to personal audience, there's a subtle shift in posture. Not enthusiasm exactly, but... attention. That part landed. Men understand equipment and access. But their expressions remain guarded, professional.\n\n\"We are all servants. Will you serve with me?\"\n\nTHE RESPONSE\n\nThere's a pause. Not an uncomfortable one, but not electric either.\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso, reading the moment, steps forward sharply. \"THREE CHEERS FOR HIS MAJESTY KING JUAN!\"\n\n\"HUZZAH!\" the guards shout in unison. Professional, well-trained, proper.\n\n\"HUZZAH!\"\n\n\"HUZZAH!\"\n\nIt's dutiful rather than passionate. They're doing what guards are supposed to do when their king addresses them. The sound echoes off the courtyard walls and dies away.\n\nFernán salutes crisply. \"Your Majesty honors us with your words and your presence. The royal guard stands ready to serve the Crown, as always.\"\n\nAs always. The words hang in the air. Not now more than ever or with renewed devotion. Just... as always.\n\nThe guards maintain their formation, awaiting dismissal. Their faces show respect—the respect soldiers show their anointed king. But there's no fire in their eyes, no visible transformation. They look exactly as they did five minutes ago: professional soldiers doing their duty.\n\nOne of the older veterans in the back rank has a slight frown—not of disapproval exactly, but perhaps of confusion. A younger guard near the front looks earnest enough, but uncertain what's expected of him now.\n\nThey're waiting. Waiting for orders, for dismissal, for whatever comes next in the daily routine.\n\nTHE REALITY\n\nBehind you, Álvaro de Luna remains silent. When you glance back, his expression is carefully neutral—neither disappointed nor pleased. Just... observing.\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso maintains his salute, professional and correct. \"Does Your Majesty have further orders for the guard?\"\n\nThe courtyard has that peculiar quality of a moment that should have been significant but somehow... wasn't. The servants at the windows are already drifting away, their curiosity satisfied. The king addressed his guards. The guards responded appropriately. Life continues.\n\nYou realize with a sinking feeling that while you haven't lost anything—the guards aren't less loyal than they were—you haven't gained anything either. They'll continue to do their jobs professionally. They'll guard you because that's what they're paid to do, what their oaths require, what their captain orders.\n\nBut that spark of personal devotion, that transformation from hired soldiers into committed followers willing to do anything for you specifically? It didn't ignite.\n\nPerhaps it was the framing. Perhaps they needed more context about threats to understand why this mattered. Perhaps your youth showed through despite your best efforts. Perhaps they've simply heard too many noble speeches in their careers to be moved by words alone, no matter how well-intentioned.\n\nOr perhaps—and this is the hardest lesson—becoming a king whom men follow with personal loyalty isn't achieved in a single speech. It's earned through time, through demonstrated competence, through shared hardship.\n\nThe guards continue to stand at attention, awaiting your command.\n\nWhat do you do?"

I am reminded that I am only a mortal and have much to learn.\"\n\nThere's a subtle shift in the guards' demeanor. Not dramatic, but present. A few of the older soldiers' expressions soften slightly. One veteran near the middle actually nods—almost imperceptibly, but you catch it. Acknowledging failure isn't what they expected from a young king.\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso's eyes show something like respect. \"Your Majesty shows wisdom,\" he says quietly.\n\nYou turn to him: \"Dismiss the men, Captain. But walk with me first—I want to discuss their equipment.\"\n\n\"Royal Guard—DISMISSED!\" Fernán barks. The formation breaks with practiced efficiency, men returning to their posts or quarters. A few glance back at you as they go, their expressions thoughtful rather than dismissive.\n\nWALKING THE RANKS\n\nBefore they fully disperse, you walk slowly along the reforming column with Fernán at your side. Up close, you can see the reality of your guard's equipment more clearly.\n\nThe captain speaks in a low, professional tone: \"Your Majesty wishes to improve our outfitting? I appreciate this. The men deserve better than they have.\"\n\nAs you pass the guards, you notice:\n\nMail shirts of varying quality—some well-maintained, others with rust spots or missing links\n\nTabards bearing your heraldry, but several are faded or poorly fitted\n\nWeapons that are functional but not uniform—different sword styles, some blades showing wear\n\nA few men have good helmets, but others have simple caps or nothing at all\n\nBoots and leather gear in various states of repair\n\nOne young guard you pass has a sword that's clearly been resharpened so many times the blade is noticeably narrower than it should be.\n\nFernán follows your gaze. \"That's young Martín. Good lad, but he inherited his father's blade and we haven't had budget to replace it.\"\n\nAs the last guards file away, Fernán turns to face you fully. \"Your Majesty, if you truly wish to outfit us properly, let me tell you what we need versus what we have.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\nCURRENT STATE & NEEDS\n\n\"Armor\"\n\"Currently: A mix. About half have decent mail shirts, the rest have partial mail or just leather and padding. None have plate components.\n\nWhat we should have: Full mail hauberks for every man, minimum. Ideally, breastplates for the senior guards. For the royal guard to look like elite troops, we should gleam.\"\n\n\"Weapons\"\n\"Currently: Every man has a sword and most have a secondary weapon—polearms, axes, crossbows. But quality varies wildly, and they're not uniform.\n\nWhat we should have: Matching, high-quality swords for every man. Good steel, properly balanced. And proper polearms—halberds or bills—that match. When we form up, we should look like one unit, not a collection of individuals.\"\n\n\"Livery\"\n\"Currently: Everyone has a tabard with your arms, but they're different ages, different makers, different fits.\n\nWhat we should have: New tabards in rich colors—red and gold for Castile. Quality cloth that doesn't fade. Maybe even embroidered rather than painted. And matching cloaks for formal occasions. Your guard should be immediately recognizable and impressive.\"\n\n\"Helmets\"\n\"Currently: Maybe twenty men have proper helmets, the rest make do.\n\nWhat we should have: Matching sallets or kettle hats for everyone. Nothing fancy, but solid and uniform.\"\n\n\"Other Considerations\"\n\"Better boots—marching destroys cheap leather. Quality belts and scabbards. Perhaps even matching horse tack if we're to accompany you on progress around the realm.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds carefully: \"Your Majesty, I must speak plainly about cost. To outfit thirty men properly as I've described... we're speaking of perhaps 150,000 to 200,000 maravedís, depending on quality and whether we commission custom work or buy from armories.\"\n\nHe watches your face. \"That's... not an insignificant sum from the treasury. Don Álvaro would know the current state of royal finances better than I. But if Your Majesty is serious about this, I can provide detailed specifications and seek quotes from master armorsmiths in Valladolid, Toledo, or Burgos.\"\n\nBehind you, Álvaro de Luna has followed at a discrete distance. He clears his throat softly, reminding you of his presence.\n\nCaptain Fernán continues: \"I'll say this, Your Majesty—the speech may not have stirred them to passion, but if you follow through on the promise of equipment? That they'll remember. Soldiers respect actions more than words. Show them you meant what you said, and you'll earn something speeches cannot give.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes directly. \"What would Your Majesty have me do? Shall I draw up specifications and cost estimates?\"\n\nWhat do you respond?"

This is a good moment to provide more detailed information about the kingdom's financial situation.\n\nNo dice roll is needed here - this is just information gathering and giving an order that will be followed.\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso salutes sharply, and this time there's genuine warmth in his expression. \"Yes, Your Majesty. I'll have detailed specifications and cost estimates on your desk within two days. I'll consult with the best armorsmiths in the city.\"\n\nHe hesitates, then adds: \"Your Majesty... thank you. The men may not have shown it properly, but this matters. You'll see.\"\n\nHe salutes again and strides off toward the barracks, already calling for his senior sergeant to begin the assessment.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna steps forward as the captain departs. \"Your Majesty handles disappointment well. That will serve you in the years ahead—there will be many.\" He says it without condescension, almost gently.\n\n\"As for the treasury... yes, we should discuss this privately. Follow me.\"\n\nHe leads you back into the palace, through the presence chamber where the petitioners still wait (they bow deeply as you pass), and down a corridor to a smaller, windowless room that serves as a counting house. Heavy ledgers line the shelves, and a large table dominates the center.\n\nÁlvaro closes the door firmly and pulls out several leather-bound account books, opening them on the table.\n\nTHE ROYAL TREASURY - DETAILED SITUATION\n\n\"Your Majesty, let me be honest about our financial position. It's... manageable, but constrained.\"\n\nHe runs his finger down columns of figures:\n\nANNUAL REVENUE: Approximately 30 million maravedís\n\nThis comes from:\n\nRoyal domain taxes: Towns and lands directly controlled by the crown (~12 million)\n\nCustoms and trade duties: Especially from Seville, Burgos, and northern ports (~6 million)\n\nSales taxes (alcabalas): Levied on transactions throughout the realm (~8 million)\n\nEcclesiastical contributions: Certain Church revenues the Pope allows you to collect (~2 million)\n\nJewish and Muslim community taxes: Special levies on religious minorities (~1.5 million)\n\nMiscellaneous: Fines, fees, confiscations (~500,000)\n\nANNUAL EXPENSES: Approximately 28 million maravedís\n\nRoyal household: Your court, servants, officials, palaces (~8 million)\n\nMilitary: The standing royal guard, frontier garrisons, castle maintenance (~7 million)\n\nAdministrative costs: Corregidores, officials, messengers, legal system (~4 million)\n\nDebt service: Interest on loans from Italian and Jewish bankers (~3 million)\n\nChurch donations and obligations: Expected royal piety (~2 million)\n\nDiplomatic expenses: Embassies, gifts, bribes (~1.5 million)\n\nMiscellaneous: Emergencies, construction, unexpected needs (~2.5 million)\n\n\"So theoretically, Your Majesty, we run a small surplus of about 2 million maravedís annually. Theoretically.\"\n\nHe looks up from the ledgers, his expression wry.\n\nTHE REALITY\n\n\"In practice, several problems constrain us:\n\nFirst, the nobles pay almost nothing. The great houses claim vast tax exemptions based on ancient privileges. They control perhaps 60% of Castile's wealth but contribute maybe 5% of royal revenue. Every attempt to tax them properly triggers rebellion threats.\n\nSecond, collection is inefficient. We're supposed to get 30 million, but perhaps 20% never makes it to the royal coffers. Local officials skim, nobles intimidate tax collectors, towns claim poverty and negotiate reductions. Our actual liquid revenue is closer to 24 million.\n\nThird, unexpected expenses are constant. A noble rebellion costs millions. A bad harvest requires grain purchases to prevent starvation. A diplomatic crisis needs sudden gifts of gold. The 'miscellaneous' category always exceeds estimates.\n\nFourth, the debt. We owe approximately 15 million maravedís to various creditors—mostly Italian banking families and wealthy Jewish financiers in Castile. That debt service of 3 million annually just keeps us even; we're not paying down the principal.\n\nCurrent liquid assets—meaning gold and silver actually in the treasury right now—amount to perhaps 1.2 million maravedís. Enough for a few months of operations if revenues stopped, but not a comfortable cushion.\"\n\nTHE GUARD EQUIPMENT IN CONTEXT\n\nÁlvaro taps the ledger: \"The Captain's estimate of 150,000-200,000 maravedís for guard equipment represents about 7-8 months of our theoretical surplus, or about 16% of our current liquid reserves.\n\nCan we afford it? Yes, technically. The treasury won't collapse.\n\nShould we spend it? That depends on Your Majesty's priorities.\"\n\nHe leans back, counting options:\n\n\"Option One: Authorize the full expenditure immediately. It shows you keep promises and value your guards. But it drains liquid reserves significantly, leaving less cushion for emergencies.\n\nOption Two: Authorize it but spread the purchases over 6-12 months, buying equipment in batches. Less dramatic impact on reserves, but the guards don't see immediate results.\n\nOption Three: Authorize a partial upgrade now—say 80,000-100,000—focusing on the most visible improvements like new tabards, helmets, and replacing the worst equipment. Complete the rest later when finances improve.\n\nOption Four: Find alternative funding. Perhaps levy a special contribution from loyal nobles 'for the enhancement of royal dignity,' or negotiate with the towns for additional funds in exchange for some minor privilege.\"\n\nHe closes the ledger and looks at you directly:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I must also point out that if you're building a new advisory cabinet and expanding royal activities as you intend, there will be additional costs. Stipends for new advisors, travel expenses, perhaps bribes for information networks. These men won't serve for free, even if they're loyal.\n\nAnd if the situation with the Infantes escalates—if we need to raise troops, fortify positions, or prepare for confrontation—military expenses could double or triple.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands: \"I'm not saying don't equip your guards. Frankly, it's good governance and they need it. But Your Majesty should understand the trade-offs. Every 100,000 maravedís spent on equipment is 100,000 not available for bribing a wavering noble, funding an informant network, or hiring mercenaries if things go badly.\"\n\nÁlvaro watches you, gauging your reaction to this financial reality.\n\n\"What are Your Majesty's thoughts? How do you wish to balance these considerations?\"\n\nWhat do you decide about the guard equipment expenditure, and are there other financial matters you want to discuss?"

Maybe no golden insignia yet, but this should enable us to be uniformly presentable and have clear and nice insignia on it.\n\n\nFurther on, I want to do the following. We have a dysfunctional taxation system and we rely overly much on nobles. We face internal threats from Aragon and our expenses are out of control. I want to fix everything.\n\n\nI want to install a council of sorts, a means to give the nobles access to me, a way for them to be heard. But I want to remain in control, that's why the guard is so important. I want to recieve every important message myself and keep to my own council. The council we are now assembling.\n\n\nI think I will call a crusade on Grenada and I want to mobilize the kingdom against them. I want to make it clear that we need an efficient tax system if we are to succeed, maybe start making a dent in that 20% of tax that keeps getting lost now everyone knows WHY we are taxing them. We tax them so we can fund the war. The war instituted by the pope and everyone not paying tax, is he not against the crusade? Is he not a good christian?\n\n\nI want to call this council of nobles together for the first time. We should send letters out explaining what this council is, how it functions and when the first council is being held. Then during this council, I will reveal that the pope has granted us crusade against Grenada and that we will take it upon ourselves to finally finish the reconquista.\n\n\nThen in order to prepare the nation for war, I will introduce a bill to make sure our army is organized into a single force, making sure all nobles contribute. And we will also introduce a bill to streamline taxation so we can pay for the war. Hopefully, the war with Grenada creates enough impulse for this law to get enough support and not rebellion.\n\n\nI will hopefully have gained support from the pope himself, also him blessing my rule and supporting my new taxation plan, indicating that a kingdom that collects lots of taxes can contribute more to the church as well. I am willing to make more concessions to his holy father in order to gain his support.\n\n\nWhat do you think of this plan?"

Use the crusade as justification for tax reform and military centralization\n5. Get papal support for all of this\n\nThis is actually a sophisticated political strategy - using external war to justify internal reforms. Historically, this has worked in some cases (England's Parliament development, French royal centralization) but also failed spectacularly in others.\n\nFrom Álvaro de Luna's perspective, he would see both the brilliance and the enormous risks here. Let me have him respond thoughtfully, breaking down:\n- What could work\n- What the risks are\n- What needs to happen for this to succeed\n- Practical steps and timeline\n\nThis is exactly the kind of complex political maneuvering that defined 15th century Castilian politics. I should give a realistic assessment that acknowledges the ambition while pointing out the many moving parts and potential failure points.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna goes completely still as you lay out your plan. His eyes widen slightly—the first time you've seen him genuinely surprised. He stares at you for a long moment, then slowly a smile spreads across his face. Not a polite smile, but something fierce and delighted.\n\n\"Por Dios, Your Majesty... you truly mean to rule.\"\n\nHe paces to the window, then back, his mind clearly racing through implications. When he speaks again, his voice carries an intensity you haven't heard before:\n\n\"This is brilliant. Genuinely brilliant. Use external war to justify internal reform, wrap it all in religious legitimacy, give the nobles a council so they feel heard while you keep real power... Your Majesty, this could work. This could actually work.\"\n\nThen his expression becomes serious, almost grave:\n\n\"But let me be absolutely clear—this is extraordinarily dangerous. You're attempting to transform Castilian governance, centralize royal authority, and launch a major war simultaneously. Any one of these could trigger noble rebellion. All three together?\"\n\nHe sits down heavily and begins ticking through the plan systematically:\n\nASSESSMENT OF YOUR STRATEGY\n\nTHE NOBLE COUNCIL - CLEVER BUT RISKY\n\n\"Creating a formal council is smart. It gives the nobles what they think they want—access and voice—while you control the substance. The key is in the details:\n\nWhat Works:\n\nSatisfies their demand to be 'consulted'\n\nCreates a forum where you can observe them, see who aligns with whom\n\nAllows you to play factions against each other\n\nIf structured right, lets you seem to grant power while retaining it\n\nThe Dangers:\n\nOnce established, a council can develop its own momentum and expectations\n\nThe Infantes will try to dominate it and use it against you\n\nIf you overrule the council too often, you'll look like you're ignoring them—defeating the purpose\n\nNobles might demand the council have binding authority, not just advisory\n\nCritical Details We Must Get Right:\n\nComposition: Who gets a seat? If it's too small, excluded nobles rebel. Too large, it's unmanageable.\n\nPowers: Purely advisory? Or do certain decisions require their consent? We must define this carefully.\n\nFrequency: Monthly meetings? Quarterly? Too often and they're always in your face. Too rare and it seems meaningless.\n\nYour control: You must chair it personally, set the agenda, and control what gets discussed.\n\nI suggest we call it the Royal Council or Council of the Realm, emphasize it's an honor to be included, and make membership something you grant—not a right nobles can claim.\"\n\nTHE GRANADA CRUSADE - YOUR STRONGEST CARD\n\n\"This is the centerpiece, and it's genuinely inspired. A crusade solves multiple problems at once:\n\nWhat It Accomplishes:\n\nUnites nobles behind a common cause instead of plotting against each other\n\nProvides religious legitimacy for everything else you do\n\nJustifies taxation as you said—who can oppose funding a Holy War?\n\nDemonstrates your kingship through decisive martial action\n\nWins glory and prestige for the Crown\n\nPotentially enriches the treasury through plunder and conquered territory\n\nGives restless nobles an outlet for their energy and ambition\n\nThe Challenges:\n\nGetting papal approval: This is not automatic. Pope Martin V is dealing with councils and schisms. You'll need to petition formally and wait for response—could take 3-6 months.\n\nGranada is not weak: Sultan Muhammad IX has a real army. This won't be easy.\n\nCost: Even with special war taxes, campaigns are expensive—could cost 5-10 million maravedís depending on scale and duration\n\nMilitary coordination: Getting fractious nobles to actually cooperate in the field is nightmarishly difficult\n\nRisk of failure: If the campaign goes badly, you'll look weak and incompetent. Failed crusades have destroyed kings.\n\nWhat You Need Before Launching:\n\nPapal bull declaring this a crusade and granting indulgences\n\nAgreement from major nobles to contribute troops\n\n6-12 months to prepare logistics, supplies, siege equipment\n\nIntelligence on Granada's current military state\n\nA clear, achievable objective (take Málaga? Besiege Granada city? Raid and withdraw?)\"\n\nTAX REFORM - THE MOST DANGEROUS PART\n\nÁlvaro's expression becomes very serious:\n\n\"Your Majesty, this is where you could lose everything. Tax reform means taking wealth and privileges from nobles who have the power to resist with armies.\n\nThe Theory Is Sound:\n\nFrame it as temporary war taxation for the crusade\n\nMake it about efficiency (fixing that 20% loss) not increasing rates\n\nTie it to Christian duty—opposing the tax is opposing the crusade\n\nUse papal support to make resistance seem impious\n\nThe Reality Is Brutal:\n\nNobles will see through this immediately. They know 'temporary' war taxes become permanent.\n\nTheir tax privileges are ancient rights, some dating back centuries. You're attacking the fundamental social contract.\n\nThey have more soldiers than you do. If enough unite against this, you cannot enforce it militarily.\n\nThe Infantes will seize on this as proof you're a tyrant destroying traditional liberties.\n\nThe Only Way This Might Work:\n\nStart small: Don't demand full taxation of nobles immediately. Ask for 'voluntary contributions' to the crusade from those who cannot fight personally. Make it about honor.\n\nTarget the efficiency issue first: The 20% lost to corruption—this everyone can agree is bad. Go after corrupt local officials, not noble privileges. Show you're a reformer, not a revolutionary.\n\nCreate gradations: Small nobles who can't afford exemptions? Tax them lightly. Great nobles who claim vast exemptions? Pressure them for 'donations' to the crusade. Make it voluntary in name, coerced in fact.\n\nUse success to justify more: If the crusade starts winning, if the new system works, if the realm prospers—then you can propose making changes permanent. Not before.\n\nBuy off key nobles: The Mendozas, for example—give them a role, a title, a captured estate in Granada. Make sure the powerful profit from the new order.\n\nAbsolutely Do Not:\n\nAnnounce sweeping tax reform before the crusade has even begun\n\nTry to abolish noble tax exemptions outright\n\nImplement reforms without the Council's 'advice' (even if you ignore it)\n\nMove faster than your military strength allows\"\n\nMILITARY CENTRALIZATION - NECESSARY BUT CONTENTIOUS\n\n\"Creating a unified royal army under your command is essential if you're to actually lead a crusade rather than just coordinate independent noble contingents.\n\nThe Argument That Might Work:\n\nFor a crusade to succeed, we need unified command\n\nThis is temporary, for the duration of the war\n\nFamous crusades succeeded because of unified leadership (invoke Richard the Lionheart, Louis IX, etc.)\n\nEach noble still commands his own men, but coordinates under your overall strategy\n\nWhat You're Actually Creating:\n\nThe framework for a permanent standing army\n\nRoyal control over military mobilization\n\nA precedent that the king commands in war, not each noble independently\n\nHow To Frame It:\n\nCall it the Army of the Cross or Host of the Crusade—religious terminology\n\nEmphasize this is about coordination, not taking away noble command\n\nGive major nobles prestigious titles: Captain of the Vanguard, Marshal of the Right Wing, etc.\n\nPromise that captured territories will be distributed according to contribution\n\nThe Infantes' Response:\n\nThey'll demand major command positions\n\nIf you give them armies to command, they could use them against you\n\nIf you don't, they'll claim you're excluding the realm's natural military leaders\"\n\nPAPAL SUPPORT - ESSENTIAL BUT NOT GUARANTEED\n\n\"Your instinct to secure Pope Martin V's blessing is exactly right. Without it, this falls apart.\n\nWhat You Need From Rome:\n\nCrusade Bull: Officially declaring war on Granada a crusade with indulgences for participants\n\nEndorsement of your rule: Confirming you as rightful king against any who might challenge you\n\nSupport for reforms: Framing efficient royal government as serving the Church's interests\n\nFinancial support: The Church has vast wealth—could they contribute to crusade costs?\n\nWhat You Can Offer:\n\nIncreased Church donations from a wealthier, better-governed realm\n\nVigorous persecution of heresy (if that interests him)\n\nExpansion of Christian territory in Iberia\n\nSupport for papal policies in wider European politics\n\nChurch positions for papal nominees in Castile\n\nThe Process:\n\nWe draft a formal petition to the Pope\n\nSend a high-ranking embassy to Rome (this should be someone impressive—perhaps a bishop allied to you)\n\nThis takes 3-6 months minimum for the round trip and negotiations\n\nMeanwhile, we cultivate Archbishop of Toledo and other Spanish prelates to support your petition\n\nRisk:\n\nThe Pope might say no, or attach conditions you don't like\n\nDuring the 3-6 month wait, the Infantes will hear about your plans and prepare countermoves\n\nPapal politics are complex—Martin V has his own concerns, and Castilian affairs may not be his priority\"\n\nÁLVARO'S OVERALL ASSESSMENT\n\nHe stands and faces you directly:\n\n\"Your Majesty, this plan could make you the strongest Castilian king in a century. Or it could trigger a civil war that destroys your reign before it truly begins.\n\nThe elements are sound: Use crusade for legitimacy, create institutions that seem to grant power while retaining it, reform gradually under cover of emergency, secure external validation from Pope.\n\nThe execution is everything: Order of moves, timing, whom you trust with what role, how you handle inevitable opposition.\n\nMy Recommendation for Sequence:\n\nPhase One (Next 2-3 Months):\n\nEquip your guard—150,000 authorized as you commanded\n\nBegin assembling your advisory cabinet quietly\n\nSend secret feelers to Rome about crusade and papal support\n\nSound out which nobles might support a crusade\n\nPhase Two (Months 3-6):\n\nAnnounce formation of Royal Council—invite major nobles\n\nAt first Council meeting, reveal you're considering a crusade and seek their counsel\n\nLet them debate it, feel involved\n\nMeanwhile, formal embassy to Rome requesting crusade bull\n\nPhase Three (Months 6-9):\n\nReceive papal approval (hopefully)\n\nAnnounce the Crusade with maximum ceremony\n\nRequest 'voluntary contributions' from nobles for the holy cause\n\nBegin military preparations and coordination\n\nPhase Four (Months 9-12):\n\nImplement 'temporary' efficiency reforms to stop corruption and fund crusade\n\nEstablish unified crusade command structure\n\nBuild up supplies, intelligence on Granada\n\nContinue solidifying your advisory network\n\nPhase Five (Year 2):\n\nLaunch the actual military campaign\n\nIf successful, use momentum to make temporary reforms permanent\n\nIf unsuccessful... we'll need contingency plans\n\nCritical Throughout:\n\nKeep the Infantes off-balance—never give them time to organize opposition\n\nNever announce reforms before you have the political strength to enforce them\n\nEvery move should seem reasonable, pious, and in the realm's interest\n\nBuild your personal power base (guards, advisors, loyal officials) continuously\"\n\nHe leans forward intently:\n\n\"Your Majesty, do you want to proceed with this plan? It will define your entire reign. Once we begin, there's no going back to being a passive king managed by nobles.\n\nAnd we must accept that this could fail. The Infantes might rebel. The nobles might refuse the crusade. The Pope might say no. Granada might defeat us. Any of these could end with you deposed or dead.\n\nBut if we succeed? You'll have transformed Castile into a realm where the king truly rules.\"\n\nHis eyes burn with intensity: \"Is Your Majesty prepared for this? Because once I send those first letters announcing the Royal Council, the game begins and everyone will know you're playing for keeps.\"\n\nWhat is your decision? Do you want to proceed with this plan, and if so, do you agree with Álvaro's phased approach or want to modify it?"

Personally.\"\n\nHe sits down heavily, then stands again, pacing. When he speaks, his voice is tight with controlled urgency:\n\n\"Sire, I must speak with absolute candor, even if it displeases you. This idea is either brilliant or catastrophic, and I genuinely cannot tell which.\"\n\nHe takes a breath and begins analyzing systematically:\n\nTHE ROME JOURNEY - ASSESSMENT\n\nWhy This Could Be Genius:\n\n\"Personal diplomacy is powerful. You're right that meeting Pope Martin V face-to-face, showing your youth, your sincerity, your devotion—this could accomplish what no letter ever would. The Pope is an old man; he might be moved by a young king's crusading zeal in a way that wouldn't happen through intermediaries.\n\nIt demonstrates courage. Kings who travel personally to petition the Pope are remembered. It shows you're willing to act, not just send envoys. This would impress people—both in Rome and at home.\n\nYou control the narrative. With letters, things get distorted, delayed, misunderstood. Face to face, you can negotiate directly, adjust your approach based on the Pope's reactions, make promises and concessions in real time.\n\nThe timing scheme is clever. Send council invitations now, depart for Rome, return with the crusade bull just in time for the first council meeting. Maximum dramatic impact. The nobles gather expecting one thing, you arrive with papal authority and a holy war. Masterful theater.\"\n\nWhy This Could Be Catastrophic:\n\nHis expression darkens:\n\n\"You will be gone for at least four months. Valladolid to Rome is roughly 1,400 miles. Even traveling fast with good weather, that's 6-8 weeks each way. Then time in Rome for audiences, negotiations, waiting on papal bureaucracy. We're looking at late summer or early autumn before you return, assuming everything goes smoothly.\n\nFour months is an eternity in politics. Your Majesty, the moment you leave Castilian territory, the Infantes will know. And they will act. They could:\n\nConvene the nobles you've invited to council and claim to speak for it in your absence\n\nSpread rumors that you've abandoned the realm or been captured\n\nPressure officials and towns to acknowledge their 'regency' until you return\n\nMove troops to secure strategic positions\n\nEven attempt to have you declared unfit and establish a regency council\n\nThe journey itself is dangerous:\n\nYou'd travel through Aragon—King Alfonso's territory, and he's the Infantes' brother\n\nBandits, weather, disease on the roads\n\nItalian politics are treacherous—city-states, mercenary companies, rival factions\n\nWhat if something happens to you? No heir, the realm plunges into succession crisis\n\nThere's no guarantee of success:\n\nPope Martin V is old and ill. He might not grant you immediate audience\n\nPapal bureaucracy moves slowly. You could wait weeks in Rome\n\nHe might say no, or attach conditions you cannot accept\n\nWhile you're gone, the Infantes could send their own embassy poisoning your case\n\nYour supporters will be horrified:\n\nEvery loyal noble will beg you not to go\n\nIt looks reckless, abandoning your kingdom when you've only just begun personal rule\n\nI cannot protect you in Rome. Neither can your guard.\"\n\nÁLVARO'S COUNTER-PROPOSALS\n\nHe holds up his hands:\n\n\"Before Your Majesty decides, let me offer alternatives:\n\nOption A: Send Me\n\nI go to Rome as your personal representative with full plenipotentiary authority. I can negotiate everything you would negotiate. I know papal politics, I speak fluent Italian, and frankly, the realm can afford to lose me more than it can afford to lose you. If I fail or am delayed or worse, you're still here ruling.\n\nOption B: Send a Powerful Embassy\n\nA delegation: Archbishop of Toledo or another high prelate, myself or another noble, perhaps a learned theologian. Impressive enough to show seriousness, but not risking your person.\n\nOption C: Go, But With Massive Security\n\nIf you insist on going personally, we make it a royal progress. Take 200+ armed men, your full court, make it a diplomatic tour through Aragon (forcing King Alfonso to receive you with honor or look like a villain). This turns it into a demonstration of strength, not a risky journey.\n\nOption D: Secret Journey\n\nGo, but quietly. Small group, travel fast, don't announce it publicly. You 'tour the realm' but actually go to Rome. The Infantes don't know you're gone until you return. Risky but keeps initiative.\"\n\nTHE COUNCIL STRUCTURE - THIS PART IS GOOD\n\nHe nods approvingly at your proposed format:\n\n\"Yearly meeting - Perfect. Often enough to seem meaningful, rare enough that it's a special event and doesn't bog you down in constant sessions.\n\nKing's invitation - Critical. You control who attends. Make it an honor, not a right.\n\nConsultative on 'important matters of state' - Good phrasing. Vague enough that you define what's 'important.'\n\nRight of audience - This is generous but smart. Nobles will value this highly.\n\nMost important political event of the year - Yes. Make it grand, ceremonial, important. The opening should be magnificent.\n\nAdditional Suggestions:\n\nCall it the Cortes of Castile or Royal Cortes - traditional name that sounds prestigious\n\nInclude representatives from major cities - burgesses from Burgos, Seville, Toledo, etc. This dilutes pure noble dominance and gives you allies among urban elites\n\nSpecify that it advises, does not bind - make this clear from the start\n\nCreate ceremonial roles - who speaks first, who sits where. Use protocol to reinforce your supremacy\n\nKeep the first meeting focused - Don't try to solve everything at once. The crusade announcement should be the centerpiece.\n\nI can begin drafting invitations immediately. They should arrive about two weeks before the actual meeting, giving nobles time to travel but not months to conspire.\"\n\nTHE PREPARATION PERIOD\n\n\"If we have a few weeks before departure—whether you go or send an embassy—here's what we accomplish:\n\nGuard Equipment: Captain Fernán is already working on this. With 150,000 maravedís and focus on function, we can have them outfitted in 3-4 weeks.\n\nAdvisory Cabinet: We've already summoned:\n\nJuan de Daza (arrives today)\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval (2 days)\n\nLope de Barrientos (3-4 days)\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza (4-5 days)\n\nRodrigo Manrique (3-10 days depending on location)\n\nYou can begin meeting with them individually, assigning initial tasks, building those relationships.\n\nChurch Officials for Rome Journey:\n\nIf you or an embassy goes, the ideal delegation includes:\n\nA high prelate - Archbishop of Toledo would be most prestigious, but he's mentioned in that letter as pushing the crusade already. Could work with us or could have his own agenda. Alternative: Bishop of Burgos or Bishop of Segovia, if they're more clearly loyal.\n\nA learned theologian - To handle doctrinal and canonical arguments. Perhaps someone from Salamanca.\n\nExperienced diplomat - Someone who knows Italian courts and papal politics.\n\nMyself or another high noble - To show this is taken seriously at the highest level.\n\nWe'd need 4-6 weeks to assemble a proper embassy and prepare them.\"\n\nTHE TIMING PROBLEM\n\nÁlvaro spreads his hands:\n\n\"Here's the sequence if you go personally:\n\nWeek 1-3: Equip guard, meet with advisory cabinet, prepare for journey\n\nWeek 4: Depart for Rome, council invitations go out\n\nWeeks 5-10: Travel to Rome (6 weeks with good conditions)\n\nWeeks 11-14: In Rome, audiences with Pope, negotiations (optimistic timeline)\n\nWeeks 15-20: Travel back (6 weeks)\n\nWeek 21: Arrive just before first council meeting\n\nThat's five months minimum, Your Majesty. More realistically, six. You'd be gone from spring through summer into early autumn.\n\nThe invitations say 'Council will convene in [autumn]' without being too specific, giving you flexibility. But that's a long time for the Infantes to work against you.\"\n\nÁLVARO'S FINAL COUNSEL\n\nHe looks at you with an expression that mixes respect, concern, and something like paternal worry:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you have the soul of a gambler. This plan—going to Rome, timing the council reveal, gambling everything on papal support—it's audacious beyond measure.\n\nI will support whatever you decide. If you command me to prepare for your personal journey to Rome, I will do so and manage the realm as best I can in your absence. If you allow me to go in your stead, I will secure that crusade bull or die trying.\n\nBut I must tell you: the safe play is sending an embassy. The bold play is going yourself. And I genuinely do not know which is right.\n\nWhat I do know is this: if you go and succeed—if you return with papal blessing, crusade authority, and catch the nobles by surprise at that first council—you will have won a tremendous victory before a single sword is drawn.\n\nBut if you go and the Infantes seize control in your absence, or if the Pope refuses you, or if something goes wrong on the journey... the game ends before it begins.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes:\n\n\"So I ask Your Majesty directly:\n\nDo you go to Rome personally, send me, send a different embassy, or reconsider the approach entirely?\n\nAnd if you go personally, how do we protect the realm in your absence? What authority do I have to act? What are my orders if the Infantes move against your interests while you're away?\"\n\nThe room falls silent. This is perhaps the most important decision of your young reign.\n\nWhat do you decide?"

          "text": "We dont have to decide right now. You keep mentioning the infantes as our main rivals, but I have yet to meet them. I feel we should do so before making a decision. Also, you mention my supporters would beg me not to go. Who are my supporters anyway? I feel like I am not the king at all if everyone is against me.\n\n\nI must say that I still feel like going to Rome is the best choice, but that does not mean we dont have to make it less risky. You fear that the infantes will dethrone me as soon as they learn I am in Rome. Lets walk through how this would work. Why would they noty do so right now? What actions would we take if they were to try?\n\n\nGoing in secret sounds like the best option. I announce I go on a tour of the kingdom in preparation for the council meeting. We travel with our court and after a few high visibility vitits, I sneak off with a few followers to take a boat from Sevilla to Rome. There I will meet up with our official delegation sent to Rome, there on a mission to shore up relationships with the pope. They can vouch for my identity if I arrive as a travelling merchant and help with our diplomacy there. If we miss them for whatever reason we proceed on our own. You meanwhile will travel somewhere remote in Castille. Maybe the Basque region? Away from prying eyes where you will keep up the act. We can disguise someone to look like me? When I return from Rome, we convene the council.\n\n\nThoughts?"

          "text": "1. They want to meet the Infantes before deciding\n2. They want to know who their actual supporters are\n3. They want to understand WHY the Infantes don't just move against them now, and what would happen if they tried\n4. They're proposing a secret journey to Rome disguised as a kingdom tour\n\nThese are all excellent, thoughtful questions that show real strategic thinking. Álvaro would be impressed but also need to provide realistic answers.\n\nLet me address each:\n\n**Meeting the Infantes**: This is actually a good idea and something that could happen. They're in Castile, they have estates, and diplomatic contact would be normal.\n\n**Who are the supporters**: The user is right to feel uncertain. I should clarify that while they don't have many *proven* passionate supporters, they have:\n- People dependent on royal authority (officials, corregidores, some clergy)\n- Towns and cities that prefer strong crown vs. noble chaos\n- Smaller nobles who fear the great houses\n- Personal loyalists (Álvaro, potentially the cabinet being assembled)\nBut the user is correct that their support base is thin, which is WHY they need to build it.\n\n**Why don't the Infantes move now**: This is a crucial question. The answer is:\n- Open rebellion against an anointed king is a big step (legitimacy matters)\n- Not all nobles support them yet\n- The king is present and alert, not absent/weak\n- Civil war is costly and risky\n- They prefer to control through \"counsel\" rather than open usurpation\nBUT if the king leaves for months, that changes the calculation significantly.\n\n**The secret journey plan**: This is actually clever and creative! But it has problems:\n- Very hard to keep secret in medieval court (servants, guards, everyone would know)\n- If discovered, looks incredibly weak/suspicious\n- A merchant traveling to Rome would still take months\n\n- The \"disguised double\" idea is pure fantasy, completely impractical in medieval political reality\n- Such a ruse would destroy any remaining credibility if discovered\n\nThe proposed plan reveals more risks than potential benefits. Medieval courts were intricate networks where secrets rarely remained hidden, and any attempt at deception would likely backfire catastrophically.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna's expression shifts—surprise, then respect, then deep thought. He sits back down, considering your questions carefully.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the right questions. Let me address each properly, because these go to the heart of your position.\"\n\nWHO ARE YOUR ACTUAL SUPPORTERS?\n\nHe spreads his hands, his voice becoming frank:\n\n\"Your Majesty feels isolated, and with good reason. The truth is your support base is thin but real. Let me be honest about who actually supports you versus who merely obeys:\n\nDEFINITELY LOYAL:\n\nMyself - Obviously. My fate is bound to yours. If you fall, I fall.\n\nRoyal officials appointed by the Crown - Men like Pedro Fernández de Velasco in Seville, various corregidores in major cities, treasury officials. They owe their positions to royal authority, not noble patronage. Perhaps 30-40 such men throughout Castile in important posts.\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso and the core royal guard - Not all thirty, perhaps, but certainly Fernán and maybe 15-20 others who are true royal servants.\n\nThe advisors we're assembling - Juan de Daza, Diego Gómez de Sandoval, and others. We're choosing them specifically because they need you more than they need the great nobles.\n\nCertain smaller nobles - Knights and minor lords who fear the great houses and see a strong crown as protection. Not organized, not numerous, but they exist scattered throughout the realm.\n\nPROBABLY SUPPORTIVE:\n\nMajor cities and towns - Burgos, Seville, Toledo, Valladolid. Not the nobles in those cities, but the merchant guilds, artisan corporations, and urban governments. They generally prefer royal authority to noble chaos because it's better for trade and order. But they won't fight for you unless their immediate interests are threatened.\n\nMuch of the Church hierarchy - Not all, and the Archbishop of Toledo has his own agenda, but many bishops and abbots prefer a strong, pious king to fractious nobles. The Church benefits from order.\n\nThe Mendoza family - Cautiously, conditionally loyal. They're powerful enough not to need the Infantes, and currently see value in supporting the crown. But if the wind shifts, they might too.\n\nNEUTRAL/WATCHING:\n\nMost middling nobles - The Manriques, Estúñigas, Velascos, and dozens of other families. They're not actively plotting against you, but they're waiting to see who comes out on top. They'll join the winning side.\n\nThe Military Orders (Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara) - Theoretically loyal to the crown, practically semi-independent. They'll cooperate if it serves their interests.\n\nACTIVELY OPPOSED:\n\nThe Infantes de Aragón and their faction - Perhaps 8-10 major noble houses firmly in their camp, representing maybe a quarter of Castile's military power.\n\nVarious discontented nobles - Those who lost power or privileges during your minority, those who simply hate me, those ambitious for more.\n\nTHE REALITY:\n\nYour Majesty is right to feel you lack a solid base. Most of the realm is neutral rather than loyal. They acknowledge you as legitimate king, but that doesn't mean they'd fight for you against a strong challenger.\n\nThis is why your plan to build institutional power, create a loyal advisory council, professionalize the guard, and launch a crusade makes sense. You're building support from scratch because you inherited a throne without a faction.\"\n\nWHY DON'T THE INFANTES MOVE NOW?\n\nÁlvaro leans forward intently:\n\n\"Excellent question, Your Majesty. Understanding this is crucial. Here's why they haven't already deposed you:\n\nLegitimacy Matters Enormously:\n\nYou are the anointed King of Castile. Crowned as an infant, blessed by the Church, recognized by all of Christendom. This isn't a minor thing in 1430—it's fundamental to the entire social order.\n\nTo openly rebel against an anointed king is to rebel against God's chosen ruler. It invites:\n\nExcommunication from the Church\n\nCondemnation from other Christian monarchs\n\nLoss of support even from nobles who dislike you\n\nCivil war that could destroy the realm\n\nThe Infantes don't want to overthrow you—that's too radical, too destabilizing. They want to control you. Keep you as king in name while they govern in fact. This is why they push for a 'council of natural advisors' rather than simply seizing the throne.\n\nThey're Not United (Yet):\n\nThe Infantes have supporters, but not overwhelming force. If they moved openly now, you could rally:\n\nThe Mendozas and other powerful families who don't want them in charge\n\nThe cities and towns\n\nRoyal officials and garrisons\n\nChurch support\n\nEven foreign support (Portugal, France don't want Aragon dominating Castile)\n\nThe resulting civil war would be genuinely uncertain. They'd rather win without fighting.\n\nYou're Present and Alert:\n\nRight now, you're here, in your palace, with guards, issuing orders, clearly in charge. Hard to claim you need 'rescue' or 'guidance' when you're visibly ruling.\n\nThey Still Have a Legal Path:\n\nThe Infantes can pressure you politically. Send letters, gather supporters, intimidate through shows of force, demand a council. If you concede to their demands, they win without rebellion. Why risk war when political pressure might work?\n\nTiming Isn't Right:\n\nThey need to build more support first, coordinate their allies, maybe wait for a crisis they can exploit. Rebellions succeed when they can claim to be 'saving the realm' from some urgent threat.\n\nWHAT CHANGES IF YOU LEAVE:\n\nNow, here's the critical part—if you're gone for four to six months:\n\nThe Legitimacy Argument Shifts:\n\nThey can say: 'The King has abandoned the realm in its hour of need. The kingdom requires governance. We must form a regency council to manage affairs until His Majesty returns.'\n\nThey're not overthrowing you—they're 'temporarily managing' in your absence. Much easier to justify.\n\nYour Supporters Can't Rally to You:\n\nIf you're in Valladolid and they make a move, loyal officials can come to you, the guard protects you, messages go out in your name. If you're in Italy? Your supporters are leaderless, confused, don't know what you want them to do.\n\nThey Control the Narrative:\n\nWhile you're gone, they control what people hear. 'The King is lost.' 'The King has been captured.' 'The King has fallen ill in Rome and may not return.' 'Affairs cannot wait—we must act.'\n\nForce Becomes More Viable:\n\nThey could seize key castles and fortresses without fighting you personally. By the time you return, they control the strategic positions and you have to retake your own kingdom.\n\nWhat Would We Do If They Moved Now?\n\nIf the Infantes attempted to seize control today, here's what would happen:\n\nImmediate military response: I'd summon loyal garrisons, hire mercenaries if needed, call on cities to close their gates to the rebels.\n\nPolitical countermeasures: Messages to all corregidores and officials, reminding them their authority comes from you. Appeals to the Mendozas and neutral nobles.\n\nChurch appeals: Seek condemnation from bishops, threaten excommunication for rebels.\n\nYou personally lead: Your presence matters. Even without a huge army, you as the legitimate king leading loyal forces changes everything.\n\nFortify your person: Move you to a secure location—Segovia's alcázar, Madrid, somewhere defensible.\n\nForeign appeals: Contact Portugal, even France, suggesting intervention if Aragon's princes usurp Castile.\n\nIt would be messy, possibly bloody, but winnable because you're here and legitimate.\n\nIf you're in Rome? I do all the same things, but without you. I claim to act in your name, but they claim you've abandoned the realm. Much, much harder.\"\n\nYOUR SECRET JOURNEY PROPOSAL\n\nÁlvaro's face shows he's genuinely considering this. He paces, thinking aloud:\n\n\"A tour of the kingdom as cover for a secret journey to Rome... Your Majesty, this shows real strategic creativity. Let me analyze it:\n\nWhat Could Work:\n\nInitial cover is plausible: A new king touring his realm before a major council makes perfect sense\n\nHigh-visibility visits: Burgos, Valladolid, Segovia—you're seen publicly, seeming to be in Castile\n\nSneaking off from Seville: That city is far south, busy port, easier to disappear from than landlocked Valladolid\n\nSea voyage is faster: Seville to Rome by ship, then up the coast and overland, cuts travel time versus going entirely by land through Aragon\n\nMeeting the official delegation: Having them vouch for you provides cover and diplomatic support\n\nMe creating the illusion: I could indeed move to the periphery, issue orders in your name, maintain the fiction\n\nThe Fatal Problems:\n\nYou Cannot Keep This Secret.\n\nYour Majesty, medieval courts are villages. Everyone knows everything. To travel from Valladolid to Seville requires:\n\nYour personal servants, who dress you, attend you constantly\n\nGuards who accompany you everywhere\n\nGrooms for your horses\n\nCooks for your meals\n\nClerks and secretaries\n\nPossibly dozens of people who see you daily\n\nThen to 'disappear' from Seville and get on a ship requires:\n\nBribing or trusting ship captains\n\nAvoiding port officials\n\nExplaining to your entourage why you're suddenly not there\n\nEvery single person who knows is a potential leak. One servant mentions it to a lover, one guard tells his brother, one clerk writes a letter... and suddenly the Infantes know.\n\nThe 'Double' Problem:\n\nYour Majesty suggests disguising someone to look like you. This is... extremely difficult. You're the king. People know your face, your voice, your mannerisms, your height, your way of moving.\n\nA distant glimpse might fool people, but:\n\nYour household staff would know immediately\n\nAnyone who speaks with 'you' would realize something's wrong\n\nMedieval people are suspicious and observant—their lives depend on reading people\n\nIf discovered, it's humiliating and destroys all credibility\n\nTime Still Required:\n\nEven by sea, Seville to Rome is still 6-8 weeks round trip minimum, plus time in Rome. You're talking about 3-4 months, possibly more. Very hard to maintain a deception that long.\n\nIf the Ruse Is Discovered:\n\nThis is perhaps the worst outcome. If people learn you:\n\nDeceived your own court and officials\n\nSnuck out of your kingdom in disguise\n\nLeft a fraud in your place\n\nYou look weak, untrustworthy, and afraid. The Infantes would have a field day: 'Our king abandoned us in secret, leaving a puppet! This proves he cannot rule!'\n\nIt would be worse than openly leaving, because it suggests you knew you couldn't leave openly—that you're not strong enough to do so.\n\nA Modified Version That Might Work Better:\n\nSemi-Public Departure:\n\nAnnounce you're going on pilgrimage to various shrines (Santiago de Compostela is in northwest Spain, very prestigious pilgrimage site)\n\nMake this religious and public—pious kings go on pilgrimage\n\nTravel with appropriate entourage to Santiago\n\nFrom there, the coast is close—ship to Rome 'to pray at St. Peter's tomb'\n\nThis is unusual but not unprecedented, and frames the whole journey as religious devotion\n\nReturn the same way\n\nAdvantages:\n\nOpenly leaving, but framed as piety not politics\n\nShorter perceived absence (pilgrimage should take 2-3 months, and you're 'only' going to Santiago officially)\n\nWhen you return with papal crusade bull, it seems natural—you were communing with the Church\n\nNo deception, no disguises, no risk of humiliating exposure\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nInfantes still know you're gone\n\nStill takes months\n\nBut at least it's honest and dignified\"\n\nMEETING THE INFANTES FIRST\n\nÁlvaro nods firmly at this:\n\n\"Yes. Yes, Your Majesty should meet them before deciding anything. You need to see them with your own eyes, read them personally, understand what you're dealing with.\n\nInfante Juan currently holds the Kingdom of Navarra and has estates in Castile. He's probably at his holdings in the Rioja region—perhaps 100 miles north.\n\nInfante Enrique is somewhere in Castile, possibly near Toledo or at estates in the south.\n\nI can arrange a meeting on neutral ground—perhaps at a castle equidistant between your locations. Frame it as the king receiving his cousins, discussing the realm's welfare. Diplomatic, proper, expected even.\n\nThis would give you:\n\nDirect assessment of their intentions\n\nChance to gauge their support and confidence\n\nOpportunity to see if there's any possibility of accommodation\n\nBetter sense of whether they're truly dangerous or just ambitious\n\nShould I arrange this? Where would you want to meet them—here in Valladolid under your control, at neutral location, or even visiting them to show confidence?\"\n\nÁlvaro stands and faces you squarely:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you ask good questions that show you're thinking like a ruler, not just following advice. Here's my summary counsel:\n\nOn Supporters: You have fewer than you need, but that's why we're building your cabinet and strengthening institutions. You're creating support, not just counting it.\n\nOn the Infantes' Restraint: They don't move because open rebellion is costly and risky. But your absence changes that calculation dangerously.\n\nOn the Secret Journey: Creative but probably too risky. The semi-public pilgrimage variant might work better if you insist on going.\n\nOn Meeting Them First: Absolutely do this. See your enemies with your own eyes.\n\nMy Recommendation:\n\nMeet the Infantes—know your opposition\n\nContinue building your advisory cabinet—strengthen your base\n\nSend a strong embassy to Rome while you remain here—less risk\n\nIf papal response is positive, then consider going yourself to seal the deal\n\nBut Your Majesty is king. If you command me to prepare the secret journey, the pilgrimage plan, or any other course, I will execute it to the best of my ability.\"\n\nHe waits for your decision.\n\nWhat do you want to do? Meet the Infantes first? Which approach to Rome appeals to you? Something else entirely?"

I will let them feel like it is their idea of the council and ask them who they think we whould invite. Make them feel like they are in control. I will also consult them about my pilgrimage and how they feel about this. If they support me going on a journey to Santiago, they hopefully already feel like they are in control already. They get their council and I make sure they have my ear when I am meeting with them. Hopefully no need for a rebellion when I am off to Rome.\n\n\nI will send my delegation to Rome to bring gifts to the pope and to establish that I as king am determined to reshape Castille in Gods image and take the pope very seriously. When I visit Santiago, maybe I have a sudden vision that I must go to Rome immediately and that God has guided me so. And then I return with the crusade and papal bull in hand at the first meeting of the council.\n\n\nThoughts?"

          "text": "Thought process\n\nThis is a very sophisticated plan from the player. Let me break down what they're proposing:\n\n1. Meet with the Infantes and play the role of a pliant, controllable young king\n2. Let them think the council was their idea\n3. Ask their advice on who to invite - making them feel in control\n4. Mention a pilgrimage to Santiago and gauge their reaction\n5. If they support the journey (thinking he'll be controllable/absent), use that as cover\n6. Send a delegation to Rome first to prepare the ground\n7. While on \"pilgrimage\" to Santiago, have a \"divine vision\" to go to Rome\n8. Return with the crusade bull just in time for the council they think they control\n\nThis is actually quite clever political maneuvering. It uses their expectations against them - they expect a weak, controllable boy-king, so he gives them that appearance while actually pursuing his own agenda.\n\nÁlvaro would likely see the brilliance of this but also be very concerned about:\n- The acting required (can an 18-year-old king convincingly play weak when he's just been assertive?)\n- The risk that they'll see through it\n- The danger of actually giving them influence over council composition\n- The timeline and coordination challenges\n- The \"divine vision\" excuse being transparent\n- What happens if the Pope says no\n\nBut he would also recognize this shows real political cunning - using deception and managing expectations. This is much more sophisticated than the previous approach.\n\nLet me have Álvaro analyze this properly, giving both the strengths and the serious risks.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stares at you for a long moment, and then—surprisingly—he laughs. Not mockery, but genuine, delighted recognition.\n\n\"Dios mío, Your Majesty... you're a natural. This is devious. I'm almost proud.\"\n\nHe sits down, his eyes bright with the thrill of conspiracy:\n\n\"You want to play the weak king, let them think they've won, then pull the rug out from under them at the council with papal authority they didn't see coming. Using their own expectations as a weapon...\"\n\nThen his expression becomes serious:\n\n\"This could work brilliantly. Or it could backfire catastrophically. Let me analyze every piece:\n\nMEETING THE INFANTES AS A 'PLIANT BOY'\n\nThe Psychological Game:\n\n\"They expect weakness. They remember you as a child during the regency. If you suddenly seem strong and independent, they get alarmed and move against you. But if you seem controllable? They relax, think they have time, think they're winning.\n\nWhat You Must Do:\n\nDefer to them constantly: 'My dear cousins, you have so much more experience...'\n\nAsk their advice: 'What do you think I should do about...?'\n\nShow uncertainty: Hesitate, seem overwhelmed by kingship\n\nPraise them effusively: 'The realm needs men of your wisdom...'\n\nDefer to their counsel: When they suggest things, seem to agree readily\n\nThe Danger:\n\nYour Majesty, you've been assertive recently. You slammed your fist on a table and declared abuse will end. You addressed your guards. You've been giving orders.\n\nCan you now convincingly play weak and uncertain?\n\nIf they sense you're acting, they'll know something is wrong. They'll realize you're more dangerous than they thought and move faster to control you.\n\nAlso: Some of your recent actions may have reached their ears through spies. The guard assembly, the equipment expenditure, summoning advisors—if they know about these, sudden weakness looks suspicious.\n\nMy Recommendation:\n\nDon't play weak—play young and earnest but overwhelmed.\n\n'Cousins, I want to rule well, but everything is so complicated. Father died when I was so young, the regency was chaotic... I need experienced men I can trust. Help me understand what I should do.'\n\nThis lets you seem genuinely uncertain (plausible for an 18-year-old) while not contradicting your recent actions (you're trying to be strong, but you're in over your head and need help).\n\nMore believable than sudden total weakness.\"\n\nTHE COUNCIL AS 'THEIR IDEA'\n\n\"Brilliant manipulation. Here's how this conversation might go:\n\nYou: 'Cousins, I've been thinking about governance. How do I ensure I have proper counsel? The realm is so complex...'\n\nThey: (eagerly) 'Your Majesty needs a council! The great nobles of the realm should advise you on all important matters!'\n\nYou: 'What a wise suggestion! I knew I could rely on your guidance. How should such a council work? Who should be included?'\n\nThey: (thinking they're designing their own power structure) 'Well, naturally, the great houses—ourselves, the Mendozas, the Masters of the military orders...'\n\nYou: 'Yes, yes, I see. Should I invite representatives from the cities as well? I want everyone to feel the crown values them...'\n\nThey: (slightly annoyed but can't say no) 'If Your Majesty wishes...'\n\nOutcome: They think they're controlling the council structure. In reality, you already decided to create one, and you're just letting them think it's their achievement.\n\nThe Risk:\n\nIf you actually let them dominate the selection process, they could pack it with their supporters. You need to:\n\nSeem to take their advice\n\nActually retain control of final invitations\n\nInclude enough of their people that they feel heard\n\nBut balance with your supporters and neutrals\n\nMaybe: 'Thank you, cousins. I'll draft the invitations based on your wise counsel and send them for your review before they go out.'\n\nThen you draft what you want, show them, they suggest changes, you accept some and deflect others ('Ah, but the Mendozas would be offended if we didn't...'), and the final list is balanced.\"\n\nTHE PILGRIMAGE GAMBIT\n\nÁlvaro's smile returns:\n\n\"This is the cleverest part. Here's how you play it:\n\nYou: 'Cousins, I've been feeling... overwhelmed by the weight of kingship. My confessor suggested I should undertake a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela to pray for guidance. To clear my mind and seek God's will for my reign. What do you think?'\n\nReading Their Reaction:\n\nIf they enthusiastically support it: They want you gone. They're planning to act in your absence. This tells you they're dangerous.\n\nIf they seem uncertain or suggest postponing: They're not ready to move yet. They want to keep manipulating you first.\n\nIf they offer to accompany you: They want to keep control of you even during the pilgrimage. Dangerous but manageable.\n\nYour Follow-Up:\n\n'I would only be gone two to three months. And of course, I would establish a regency council to manage affairs—perhaps you two could lead it? That way the realm would be in capable hands.'\n\nThis is perfect because:\n\nYou're offering them exactly what they want (temporary control)\n\nThey think this is you being naive and trusting\n\nActually, you've limited the damage (only 2-3 months, defined structure, it's temporary and you're coming back)\n\nWhile you're 'on pilgrimage,' you're actually securing papal support that will trump their whole position\n\nThe Danger:\n\nIf they actually establish a regency council with real power while you're gone, breaking it when you return could trigger the confrontation you're trying to avoid.\n\nSolution: Keep the regency council's powers vague and limited. 'Just handle routine administration, nothing major. I'll be back soon.'\n\nOr better: 'Don Álvaro will manage things as he always has, but I'd value your counsel being available to him if needed.'\n\nThis makes them advisors to Álvaro rather than giving them actual regency authority.\"\n\nTHE 'DIVINE VISION' IN SANTIAGO\n\nÁlvaro winces slightly:\n\n\"Your Majesty, this is the part I'm most worried about. Let's think through the timeline and credibility:\n\nThe Story:\n\nYou're in Santiago, praying at the shrine of St. James. You have a vision—St. James himself appears and commands you to go to Rome, to St. Peter's tomb, to seek the Pope's blessing for a great holy work.\n\nOvercome with divine revelation, you immediately change plans and sail for Rome.\n\nWhy It Could Work:\n\nMedieval people believe in visions and divine intervention\n\nKings having religious experiences is not unusual\n\nSantiago is already a holy site—having a vision there is plausible\n\nIt explains a sudden change of plans\n\nIt makes your Rome journey seem involuntary—God commanded it, not political calculation\n\nWhy It's Risky:\n\nThe Infantes aren't fools. A convenient vision right after they endorsed your pilgrimage? Suspicious.\n\nIf you planned this from the start (which you did), there might be evidence—servants who heard preparations, ship captains booked in advance, etc.\n\nThe Pope might not give you what you want, and then you return claiming divine command but empty-handed—humiliating\n\nSome clerics might question the authenticity of your vision (though most won't dare)\n\nMaking It More Credible:\n\nDon't plan it too obviously: Actually go to Santiago with genuine pilgrimage intent. Then 'decide' to extend to Rome.\n\nHave witnesses: Bring a confessor who can attest to your spiritual state and 'confirm' the vision\n\nMake it costly: A real divine command would be inconvenient. Show reluctance: 'The vision compels me, but I worry about leaving the realm longer...'\n\nWrite letters from Santiago: To Álvaro, the Infantes, the Archbishop—explaining the vision, seeking their understanding. This creates a paper trail of 'sincerity.'\n\nAlternative That's More Plausible:\n\nInstead of a sudden vision, make it gradual:\n\nIn Santiago, you have profound religious experiences (true for many pilgrims)\n\nYou write to the Pope from Santiago about spiritual matters and Castile's needs\n\nThe Pope responds inviting you to Rome (arranged by your advance delegation)\n\nYou accept the Pope's invitation—you can't refuse the Holy Father\n\nThis is more believable because it's Pope-initiated rather than vision-driven. Still accomplishes the same thing.\"\n\nTHE ADVANCE DELEGATION\n\n\"This part is solid. We send:\n\nComposition:\n\nA high-ranking prelate (Bishop of Burgos or similar)\n\nA learned theologian\n\nA diplomat who knows Rome\n\nPerhaps one of your new advisors once they're established\n\nTheir Mission:\n\nPresent gifts to Pope Martin V (costly items showing wealth and piety)\n\nExpress your devotion and desire to serve the Church\n\nMention your interest in crusade against Granada (plant the seed)\n\nAssess the Pope's health, mood, priorities\n\nPrepare the ground so when you arrive, you're expected and welcomed\n\nTimeline:\n\nThey leave within 2-3 weeks\n\nArrive in Rome 6-8 weeks later\n\nBegin negotiations\n\nYou arrive 4-6 weeks after them (after Santiago pilgrimage)\n\nThey vouch for you, support your petition\n\nThis works well because:\n\nYou're not arriving cold; the Pope knows about you already\n\nYour delegation has prepared arguments and assessed the situation\n\nWhen you arrive personally, it's a dramatic escalation that shows seriousness\n\nIf the Pope is initially reluctant, your personal presence might change his mind\"\n\nTHE COUNCIL REVELATION\n\nÁlvaro's eyes gleam:\n\n\"The theater of this moment will be magnificent:\n\nThe Scene:\n\nThe first Royal Council convenes. The Infantes arrive confident, thinking they control the situation. Other nobles gather, uncertain what to expect. The great hall is filled with the realm's powerful men.\n\nYou enter—everyone rises.\n\nYour Opening:\n\n'My lords, I thank you for attending this first meeting of our Royal Council. You have been gathered so that the Crown may have the benefit of your collective wisdom in governing our realm.'\n\n(The Infantes smile—this is what they wanted)\n\n'I have recently returned from holy pilgrimage, and I bring news that will affect us all. I traveled to Santiago de Compostela, and from there, I was called to Rome itself, to the Holy Father's presence.'\n\n(Confusion in the room—wait, Rome? When did this happen?)\n\n'I am honored to present to this council...'\n\n(You gesture, and a papal legate steps forward with the official bull)\n\n'...the blessing of His Holiness Pope Martin V for a holy Crusade against the Moorish Kingdom of Granada. The Pope himself has granted indulgences and named this a sacred endeavor. The Cross calls us, my lords. Will Castile answer?'\n\nThe Effect:\n\nComplete surprise—they didn't know you went to Rome\n\nPapal authority trumps everything—opposing the crusade means opposing the Pope\n\nYou've seized the initiative—they came thinking they controlled the agenda\n\nReligious fervor sweeps the room—crusade is exciting, glorious\n\nAny opposition to your leadership looks like opposing a holy war\n\nThe Danger:\n\nIf you don't actually have the papal bull when you return, this entire theatrical moment collapses into humiliation.\n\nEverything—everything—depends on the Pope saying yes.\"\n\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT\n\nÁlvaro stands and paces, hands behind his back:\n\n\"Your Majesty, this plan shows real political instinct. The deception, the manipulation of expectations, the dramatic timing—these are the tools of successful kingship.\n\nSuccess Probability: LIKELY TO SUCCEED\n\nHere's why I rate it favorably:\n\nStrengths:\n\nUses their expectations against them\n\nAchieves your goals (council, Rome journey, crusade) while making them think they're winning\n\nThe theatrical revelation could genuinely unite the realm\n\nLower risk than openly defying them before you have papal backing\n\nTimeline is tight but workable\n\nCritical Dependencies:\n\nCan you convincingly act the uncertain young king? This requires real performance skill\n\nWill the Pope grant the crusade bull? Everything hinges on this\n\nCan Álvaro (me) hold the realm together while you're gone? I believe so, especially if the Infantes think they've won\n\nWill they believe the vision/invitation story? The Pope-invitation version is more credible\n\nCan the timing work? Very tight—4-6 months total, coordinating delegation, your journey, and council date\n\nHow I'd Modify It:\n\nMeet the Infantes soon—next week if possible\n\nPlay 'earnest but overwhelmed' rather than 'weak'—more believable\n\nLet them shape council composition but retain final control—balance is key\n\nAnnounce pilgrimage to Santiago—gauge their reaction\n\nSend advance delegation immediately—they need time to prepare the ground\n\nUse 'papal invitation' rather than 'divine vision'—more credible\n\nTimeline: Depart in 3-4 weeks, return in 4-5 months—just in time for autumn council\n\nHave contingency plans if Pope refuses—maybe lesser blessing, maybe delay crusade announcement\n\nThe Biggest Risk:\n\nIf the Pope says no, or grants only weak support, you return having been gone for months with little to show for it. The Infantes would then have momentum.\n\nBut if he says yes—if you return with a genuine crusade bull—you win an enormous political victory without firing a shot.\"\n\nÁlvaro meets your eyes:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I believe this can work. I'll support it. But we must execute flawlessly.\n\nShall I:\n\nArrange the meeting with the Infantes—where and when?\n\nBegin preparing the advance delegation—selecting members, gathering gifts, drafting messages?\n\nDraft the council invitations—for you to 'discuss' with the Infantes after the meeting?\n\nAuthorize the 150,000 for guard equipment—so they look impressive when you return?\n\nAnd one more thing, Your Majesty...\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his words carefully:\n\n\"If you're going to play the uncertain young king with the Infantes, you should practice. I could play their role—we could rehearse the conversation so you're smooth when it matters. Deception is a skill. It requires preparation.\n\nWhat are your commands?\"\n\nHow do you want to proceed? Should we practice the deception? Where do you want to meet the Infantes? Any adjustments to the plan?"

          "text": "The \"surprise\" element I described doesn't work logically. Let me think through this more carefully:\n\nOptions:\n1. The journey to Rome IS announced/known, but the CRUSADE BULL is the surprise - they know he went, but don't know what he's bringing back\n2. The pilgrimage to Santiago is cover for a SECRET journey to Rome - but this has the deception problems we already discussed\n3. The pilgrimage is real, the extension to Rome happens but is public knowledge, and the surprise is just the success/content of the papal bull\n4. Something else\n\nThe user is right to call this out. The plan as I described it doesn't make logical sense. The \"surprise\" can't be that he went to Rome if he's been gone for months and sent letters/delegations. The surprise has to be either:\n- That he succeeded in getting papal backing (they might have known he was trying but didn't think he'd get it)\n- The specific contents/terms of the crusade bull\n- The timing of the announcement at the first council meeting\n\nI need to clarify this logical inconsistency and help the user understand what would actually be surprising versus what would be known.\n\nAlso, regarding \"deception\" - medieval politics involved a lot of maneuvering, but outright lying to your nobles about where you are and what you're doing could indeed be seen as dishonorable and damage trust. The question is how to frame the Rome journey.\n\nÁlvaro stops mid-gesture, his confident expression faltering. He pauses, then actually laughs—this time at himself.\n\n\"Your Majesty is absolutely right. I got carried away with the drama of the moment and stopped thinking clearly. Let me reconsider.\"\n\nHe sits back down, rubbing his temples:\n\n\"You're correct—if you're gone for four to six months on what was announced as a two-month pilgrimage to Santiago, everyone will know something changed. Letters travel, ships arrive with news, merchants gossip. The Infantes would hear 'the King has gone to Rome' within weeks of your arrival there.\n\nSo the 'surprise' at the council cannot be that you went to Rome. That's not a secret that can be kept.\"\n\nHe thinks for a moment:\n\nWHAT COULD ACTUALLY BE SURPRISING?\n\n\"Let me reconsider what they wouldn't know:\n\nThey Would Know:\n\nYou went on pilgrimage to Santiago\n\nYou extended your journey to Rome (this becomes known)\n\nYou had an audience with the Pope (word would spread)\n\nYou've been negotiating something (obvious)\n\nThey Might Not Know:\n\nWhether you actually succeeded in getting papal backing\n\nThe specific terms of what the Pope granted\n\nThe timing of when you'll announce it\n\nThe exact nature of the crusade bull (is it vague encouragement or a full-throated call to arms with indulgences?)\n\nThe Real Surprise:\n\nThe surprise isn't that you went to Rome. The surprise is that you:\n\nActually secured a formal Crusade Bull - they might think you tried and failed, or got only weak papal platitudes\n\nReturn at the exact moment of the first council meeting - perfect timing for dramatic effect\n\nPresent it as a fait accompli - not 'I'm thinking about maybe doing this someday,' but 'The Pope has commanded it, we're doing this, the only question is how'\n\nUse it to completely reframe the council's purpose - they thought they were gathering to establish their control over you, instead they're being recruited for a holy war\n\nSo it's not 'surprise, I went to Rome!' It's 'surprise, I actually succeeded, and now everything you planned is irrelevant because we're all going to war for God.'\"\n\nTHE DECEPTION QUESTION\n\nÁlvaro's expression becomes more serious:\n\n\"You ask about deception, and this is a crucial question about honor and perception.\n\nWhat Is Considered Deceptive:\n\nIn medieval noble culture, outright lying about your location or intentions—especially to your own nobles—is dishonorable. If you announce a pilgrimage to Santiago, then secretly go to Rome while using a double or claiming to be somewhere you're not, that's seen as:\n\nCowardly (hiding your true actions)\n\nDishonorable (lying to men who deserve your trust)\n\nWeak (acting like you fear them rather than commanding them)\n\nIf discovered, it makes you look less kingly, not more.\n\nWhat Is Considered Smart Politics:\n\nHowever, the following are all acceptable statecraft:\n\nNot announcing your plans in advance\n\nLetting people make assumptions you don't correct\n\nPursuing negotiations secretly before announcing results\n\nChanging your plans without seeking permission\n\nAchieving something and then revealing it\n\nSo Here's A Better Approach:\n\nOption A: Semi-Public Journey\n\n'My lords, I'm undertaking a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, and from there I may travel further if the spirit moves me. I expect to be away for four to six months. Don Álvaro will manage routine affairs in my absence, with the counsel of my dear cousins the Infantes if matters of importance arise. I will return in time for the first gathering of the Royal Council.'\n\nWhat This Accomplishes:\n\nYou're being vague but not lying\n\n'May travel further' covers Rome without announcing it\n\n'4-6 months' is honest about timeline\n\nEveryone knows you're gone, but not exactly what you're doing\n\nWhen you go to Rome, it's not a surprise—you left that option open\n\nThe surprise is what you accomplish there\n\nOption B: Announced Pilgrimage, Spontaneous Extension\n\n'I'm going to Santiago for 2-3 months.'\n\nThen, from Santiago, you send letters: 'My confessor and I have felt a calling to continue to Rome, to pray at St. Peter's tomb and seek the Holy Father's blessing on my reign. I will be away longer than expected—please manage affairs until my return in autumn.'\n\nWhat This Accomplishes:\n\nInitial announcement is honest\n\nExtension is explained as religious inspiration (hard to criticize)\n\nPeople know you're in Rome\n\nThey just don't know you're negotiating a crusade\n\nWhen you return with the bull, that's the surprise\n\nOption C: Fully Announced Rome Journey\n\n'My lords, I am traveling to Santiago and then to Rome to seek the Pope's blessing on my reign and discuss matters important to Castile. I will return in autumn for the first Council meeting.'\n\nWhat This Accomplishes:\n\nComplete honesty\n\nNo risk of appearing deceptive\n\nThe mystery is what you're discussing with the Pope\n\nNobles might guess it's about a crusade, but they don't know if you'll succeed\n\nThe Infantes can't claim you deceived them\n\nYou look confident and kingly—openly doing what you want\n\nThe Trade-offs:\n\nOption A (vague): Low risk of seeming deceptive, maintains some mystery, but Infantes might still guess your purpose\n\nOption B (spontaneous extension): Plausible but slightly suspicious, medium mystery\n\nOption C (announced): Most honest, but the Infantes have maximum time to counter your plans and might send their own embassy to Rome to work against you\n\nI think Option A or C are best. Option B (the 'spontaneous' extension) is the one most likely to be seen as deceptive if your planning becomes evident.\"\n\nWHAT THE INFANTES WOULD DO IF THEY KNOW\n\n\"Your Majesty, here's the real question: what happens if the Infantes know you're going to Rome to seek crusade authorization?\n\nPossible Responses:\n\nThey Send Their Own Embassy - to argue against you, or to demand they be given command of the crusade forces. But the Pope will favor a legitimate king over rebel princes.\n\nThey Try to Block You - but how? You're the anointed king traveling to see the Pope. Stopping you by force would be outrageous.\n\nThey Prepare Counter-Arguments - maybe they start telling nobles 'a crusade now would be foolish, too expensive, Granada is too strong, the king is being reckless.' But crusade has religious weight—hard to oppose openly.\n\nThey Wait and See - assuming you'll fail, or get only weak support, or that they can control the crusade once it's announced.\n\nMy Assessment:\n\nEven if they know you're seeking a crusade, they probably can't effectively stop you. The worst they can do is prepare political opposition for when you return.\n\nBut here's the thing: crusades are popular. The nobility loves them—glory, plunder, religious merit, martial honor. The Church loves them. Even the common people support them.\n\nIf you return with a papal crusade bull, most nobles will want to participate, including many who currently support the Infantes. This is why it's such a good move politically.\n\nThe Infantes' best play might actually be to support the crusade and demand prominent roles in it—trying to use it to build their own prestige. Which is fine! Let them come fight for God under your command.\"\n\nREVISED RECOMMENDATION\n\nÁlvaro leans forward:\n\n\"Your Majesty, having thought it through more carefully:\n\nAnnounce your intentions fairly openly. Something like:\n\n'I'm undertaking a pilgrimage to Santiago, and I may travel to Rome to seek the Holy Father's blessing and counsel on important matters facing the realm. I'll return in time for the first Council meeting in autumn.'\n\nWhy This Works Better:\n\nNo deception - you're being honest about your general plans\n\nMaintains some mystery - 'important matters' could mean anything\n\nShows confidence - you're not sneaking around, you're openly going to see the Pope\n\nGives them a timeline - 'autumn council' so they're not panicking about indefinite absence\n\nHard to oppose - how can they criticize you for seeking papal guidance?\n\nIf they guess crusade - so what? You're still the one making it happen\n\nThe Surprise at the Council becomes:\n\nNot 'I went to Rome' but rather:\n\n'I succeeded - here's the official papal bull'\n\n'The crusade begins next spring - here are the terms'\n\n'The Pope has blessed my reign and reforms'\n\n'Who will join me in this holy endeavor?'\n\nThis is still dramatic, because success is never guaranteed, and the specific terms and timing are still unknown until you reveal them.\n\nDoes this make more sense, Your Majesty? A plan that's less about secret deception and more about competent execution of a bold strategy?\"\n\nHe looks at you, clearly feeling he's corrected a significant logical flaw.\n\n\"Should we revise the overall plan with this more honest approach? Or do you have a different vision?\"\n\nWhat do you think? Does this more transparent approach work better?"

Yes—keep the full plan between us, your confessor, and perhaps one or two others who absolutely must know. The tighter the circle, the safer the secret.\"\n\nHe considers your question about the guard carefully:\n\nTHE GUARD QUESTION - STRATEGIC ANALYSIS\n\n\"Whether to take all thirty men is a real tactical decision with significant implications. Let me lay out the considerations:\n\nIF YOU TAKE THE ENTIRE GUARD (All 30 Men):\n\nAdvantages:\n\nMaximum personal security - This journey takes you through varied terrain, including parts of Aragon potentially. Bandits, hostile nobles, 'accidents'—all are risks. Thirty armed, loyal men make you very hard to threaten.\n\nShows royal authority - A king traveling with a proper military escort looks like a king. It's a statement of power and legitimacy.\n\nDenies them to the Infantes - While you're gone, these thirty men can't be bribed, threatened, or suborned by your enemies. They're with you, loyal, and out of play.\n\nThey see your triumph - When you meet the Pope, when you secure the crusade bull, these men witness it. They'll return as evangelists for your success, telling everyone what they saw.\n\nYou've just equipped them - We're spending 150,000 maravedís making them look impressive. Good timing to show them off across the realm and in Rome.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nLeaves no royal military presence - Valladolid palace, and by extension Don Álvaro, would have no loyal armed force. If the Infantes moved militarily, there's nothing to stop them from occupying royal buildings and claiming they're 'securing' them.\n\nLogistical burden - Moving thirty men plus support staff (grooms, servants, etc.) means perhaps 50+ people total. This requires planning for food, lodging, transport. Expensive and slow.\n\nAnnounces importance - A thirty-man military escort says 'this is a major royal expedition,' not 'humble pilgrimage.' Makes your journey more conspicuous.\n\nTravel speed - Large groups move slower. You might add weeks to the journey coordinating that many people.\n\nAll eggs in one basket - If something goes catastrophically wrong—ambush, shipwreck, plague—you lose your entire loyal military force at once.\n\nIF YOU TAKE PART OF THE GUARD (15-20 Men):\n\nAdvantages:\n\nAdequate security - Fifteen to twenty armed men is still a formidable force. Enough to deter bandits and make you difficult to threaten.\n\nLeaves a core behind - Ten to fifteen guards remain in Valladolid under Captain Fernán, providing security for the palace and Álvaro.\n\nMore flexible - Smaller group travels faster, costs less, can adapt more easily.\n\nBalanced risk - If disaster strikes, you haven't lost all your loyal troops.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nDivided loyalty concerns - The guards left behind might face pressure from the Infantes. Though if Fernán stays with you and takes the most reliable men, this helps.\n\nLess impressive - Fifteen men is respectable but not overwhelming. In Rome, might look less regal.\n\nThe left-behind guards are vulnerable - If the Infantes move against the palace, 10-15 men can't hold it against a determined assault.\n\nIF YOU TAKE A SMALL ESCORT (5-10 Men):\n\nAdvantages:\n\nFast, flexible travel - Small group moves quickly, attracts less attention\n\nMost guards stay to secure Valladolid - Strong defensive presence remains\n\nLower cost - Significantly cheaper to maintain\n\nCould be more appropriate for 'humble pilgrimage' - Less military, more devotional appearance\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nPotentially inadequate security - Ten men might not be enough if you face real threats\n\nLooks less kingly - In Rome, appearing with only a handful of guards might seem weak\n\nLimited deterrent - Not enough to make hostile nobles think twice\n\nÁLVARO'S RECOMMENDATION\n\nHe stands and paces:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I recommend taking twenty to twenty-five men—about two-thirds to three-quarters of your guard.\n\nHere's why:\n\nSecurity: Twenty men is enough for serious protection. You can post sentries, rotate watches, respond to threats. It's a real military force, not just symbolic.\n\nRoyal Dignity: In Rome, arriving with twenty armed men in your new livery, disciplined and impressive, makes a statement. The Pope sees a king, not a supplicant.\n\nLeaves a Core Behind: Captain Fernán Alonso should travel with you—he's personally loyal and the men follow him. But leave his senior sergeant (I'll identify the second most reliable man) in command of eight to ten guards in Valladolid. This gives Álvaro and the palace some protection.\n\nPracticality: Twenty men is manageable logistically. Not so large that travel becomes a nightmare, but substantial enough for all the benefits.\n\nSelection: You take the most reliable men. Anyone we're uncertain about stays behind where we can watch them.\n\nWHO ELSE TRAVELS WITH YOU:\n\nBeyond the guard, Your Majesty will need:\n\nEssential:\n\nYour confessor - Critical for the pilgrimage and Rome meetings. He provides spiritual guidance and can witness your sincerity.\n\nA senior cleric - Perhaps the Bishop of Burgos if we can arrange it, or at minimum a respected abbot. Someone who can speak authoritatively in Rome.\n\nA secretary/clerk - To handle correspondence, documents, the formal papal bull when you receive it.\n\nPersonal servants - Chamberlain, body servant, at least 2-3 people who attend you personally.\n\nPhysician - Four to six months traveling, you need medical care if you fall ill.\n\nHighly Desirable:\n\nOne of your new advisors - Perhaps Diego Gómez de Sandoval or Juan de Daza once you've met them. Someone intelligent who can observe, advise, and witness your success.\n\nA diplomat familiar with Rome - If we can find one quickly, someone who knows how papal audiences work, who to bribe, which cardinals matter.\n\nSupport Staff:\n\nGrooms for horses\n\nCook and kitchen servants\n\nGuards' attendants\n\nPerhaps 10-15 additional support personnel\n\nTotal expedition size: 40-50 people\n\nThis is substantial but manageable. A king traveling with forty to fifty people is appropriate and expected.\"\n\nTHE COMMAND QUESTION\n\nÁlvaro's expression becomes more serious:\n\n\"Your Majesty, there's another consideration: Do I accompany you, or stay to manage the realm?\n\nIf I Come With You:\n\nAdvantages:\n\nYou have your most trusted, most experienced advisor personally present\n\nI can handle negotiations in Rome—I know how these work\n\nWe can make decisions together in real time\n\nThe guard and your staff all know and respect me—leadership is clear\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nThe realm has no strong hand managing it in your absence\n\nThe Infantes face much less resistance if they move\n\nRoyal officials have no clear authority figure to rally around\n\nSome nobles might see it as both of us abandoning Castile\n\nIf I Stay Behind:\n\nAdvantages:\n\nI can manage the realm, issue orders in your name, coordinate with loyal officials\n\nThe Infantes face an opponent—they can't simply act unopposed\n\nContinuity of government is maintained\n\nIf they try anything, I can rally resistance until you return\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nYou're without your most trusted advisor during crucial negotiations\n\nDecisions in Rome must be made by you alone or with less experienced counsel\n\nIf something happens to you, I'm not there to help\n\nThe expedition lacks clear political leadership beyond you\n\nMy Honest Recommendation:\n\nI should stay. Here's why:\n\nYou're going to Rome precisely because you need papal authority to counterbalance the Infantes. While you're securing that authority, someone must hold your position at home. If both of us are gone, there's a vacuum.\n\nMoreover, Your Majesty, this journey is about you demonstrating your own capability and initiative. Arriving in Rome with your powerful Constable doing the talking makes you look like my puppet—exactly what the Infantes claim. Arriving alone (with appropriate clerical and noble support, but no one who overshadows you) and successfully negotiating with the Pope? That proves you're a king in your own right.\n\nIt's riskier for you, but it's better politics.\n\nAlternative Compromise:\n\nI accompany you to Santiago (2-3 weeks journey), ensuring the pilgrimage starts smoothly and you're safely through any dangerous territory. Then I return to Valladolid to manage affairs while you continue to Rome. This gives you my counsel for the Castilian portion and leaves me positioned to hold things together during the Rome portion.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly:\n\n\"So, Your Majesty:\n\nHow many guards? - I recommend 20-25, but it's your decision\n\nDo I come or stay? - I recommend staying, or the compromise of accompanying you to Santiago only\n\nWho else travels with you? - We need to identify the right confessor, cleric, and advisor\n\nWhat are your commands?\"\n\nWhat do you decide?"

          "text": "1. A king's confessor would typically be a member of a religious order - Dominicans, Franciscans, or perhaps a secular priest\n2. They would be educated, trustworthy, and have significant influence\n3. They would hear the king's confession and provide spiritual guidance\n4. In this period, they often had political influence as well\n5. I should make this person interesting and useful to the narrative\n\nLet me create a confessor that:\n- Is believable for the period\n- Has a personality and background\n- Could be useful for the journey to Rome\n- Adds depth to the story\n\nI'll make them someone with their own perspective who isn't just a yes-man, but is ultimately loyal to the king.\n\nÁlvaro pauses, and you realize you've asked a question he should have addressed earlier. His expression shows a flicker of concern.\n\n\"Your Majesty's confessor... that's actually an important gap we need to address.\"\n\nHe sits down, choosing his words carefully:\n\n\"During your minority, you had several confessors assigned by the regency council—men chosen more for political reliability than spiritual depth. The most recent was Father Gonzalo, a Franciscan friar, but he passed away this past winter. God rest his soul.\n\nSince then, Your Majesty has been... between confessors. You've made confessions to whatever priest was available when needed, but you haven't appointed a permanent royal confessor. This is, frankly, something we should have handled by now.\"\n\nHe stands and paces:\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF A CONFESSOR\n\n\"Your Majesty, a king's confessor is more than just the priest who hears your sins. He becomes:\n\nYour spiritual advisor - guiding your conscience on moral matters\n\nA confidant - one of the few people who sees you at your most vulnerable and must keep your secrets absolutely\n\nPolitical counsel - whether we like it or not, confessors often influence policy through the lens of morality\n\nWitness to your piety - his testimony about your devotion matters to the Church and realm\n\nPotential ambassador - educated confessors can serve diplomatic roles\n\nFor this journey to Rome, having the right confessor is crucial. The Pope will likely speak with your confessor privately to assess your true character and intentions.\"\n\nCANDIDATES FOR ROYAL CONFESSOR\n\nÁlvaro begins outlining options:\n\n\"Fray Pablo de Santa María\"\n\n\"Age: About fifty-five. A Dominican friar from Burgos.\n\nBackground: He comes from a converso family—his father was a rabbi who converted to Christianity and became Bishop of Burgos. Fray Pablo himself is deeply learned, speaks Latin, Hebrew, and Arabic fluently, and is passionate about defending the faith.\n\nStrengths:\n\nBrilliant theologian who could hold his own with papal scholars\n\nUnderstanding of both Jewish and Christian theology (useful given the religious diversity of your realm)\n\nIntense personal piety—genuinely devout, not just political\n\nNo ties to the great noble families\n\nRelatively young and energetic for the journey\n\nPotential Issues:\n\nSome Old Christians distrust conversos, even ones who became friars\n\nCan be intellectually intense and demanding—might challenge Your Majesty's decisions on moral grounds\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo dislikes him (professional rivalry)\n\nMy Assessment: He would be impressive in Rome, fiercely loyal to you personally, and genuinely helpful as a spiritual guide. But he's not a 'safe' choice—he has opinions and will express them.\"\n\n\"Father Íñigo de Mendoza\"\n\n\"Age: Mid-forties. A Franciscan friar.\n\nBackground: Yes, from that Mendoza family, but he took religious vows young and has spent his life in monasteries and missions. Currently serves at a monastery near Valladolid.\n\nStrengths:\n\nThe Mendoza connection could be useful—shows you honor their family\n\nWell-educated and diplomatic\n\nKnown for gentle temperament and political acumen\n\nWould be acceptable to virtually everyone\n\nGood at navigating court politics\n\nPotential Issues:\n\nMight report back to his family—divided loyalties?\n\nPerhaps too political, not spiritual enough?\n\nCould be seen as you being influenced by the Mendozas\n\nMy Assessment: A safe, respectable choice. Would serve competently. But would he truly be your man, or his family's?\"\n\n\"Fray Lope de Barrientos\"\n\n\"Age: About forty-five. The Dominican friar I mentioned earlier as a potential advisor.\n\nBackground: Currently teaching at Salamanca, brilliant scholar, expert in theology and natural philosophy.\n\nStrengths:\n\nExceptional intellect—could impress the papal curia\n\nNo political connections to nobles—completely independent\n\nDeeply knowledgeable about Church law and doctrine\n\nPassionate about learning and truth\n\nWould be absolutely loyal to you personally\n\nPotential Issues:\n\nMore scholar than pastor—better at theology than understanding human hearts\n\nRelatively unknown—no established reputation\n\nMight be too intellectual, not mystical enough for a confessor's role\n\nMy Assessment: Brilliant mind, would make an excellent advisor. As a confessor? Perhaps slightly unconventional, but could work if Your Majesty values intellectual partnership.\"\n\n\"Father Alonso de Cartagena\"\n\n\"Age: Late forties. A secular priest and scholar, currently serving in Burgos.\n\nBackground: Another converso—son of the same former rabbi who became bishop. Brother to Fray Pablo. Exceptionally learned, has already traveled to the Council of Basel as a Church diplomat.\n\nStrengths:\n\nDiplomatic experience—knows how Church politics work\n\nHas been to Rome before—understands the environment\n\nSophisticated, worldly, politically astute\n\nExcellent connections in the Church hierarchy\n\nSpeaks multiple languages\n\nPotential Issues:\n\nPerhaps too worldly? More diplomat than confessor?\n\nThe converso background again\n\nMight try to use the position for his own Church career\n\nMy Assessment: If you want someone who can navigate Rome expertly and handle complex negotiations, he's your man. If you want someone primarily for spiritual guidance, perhaps not.\"\n\n\"Fray Hernando de Talavera\"\n\n\"Age: Early thirties. A young Hieronymite monk.\n\nBackground: From a humble background, rose through merit and devotion. Currently serves at a monastery in Toledo. Known for extreme personal piety, charity work, and moral rigor.\n\nStrengths:\n\nGenuinely holy—the kind of man people instinctively trust\n\nYoung enough to relate to Your Majesty's age\n\nNo political connections whatsoever\n\nWould inspire confidence in Rome about your spiritual sincerity\n\nHumble background means completely dependent on your favor\n\nPotential Issues:\n\nVery young and inexperienced for such a high position\n\nExtremely strict morally—might be challenging to deal with\n\nLimited education compared to others (though still well-trained)\n\nUnknown to the papal curia—no existing connections\n\nMy Assessment: If you want a confessor who will keep you spiritually honest and whom the Pope will see as genuine, he's excellent. If you need sophisticated political counsel, less so.\"\n\nÁLVARO'S RECOMMENDATION\n\n\"Your Majesty, you need to choose based on what you value most:\n\nFor Rome Success & Diplomatic Skill: Father Alonso de Cartagena - He knows how to navigate the papal court and has experience there.\n\nFor Intellectual Partnership: Fray Lope de Barrientos - Brilliant mind who can debate theology and advise on complex matters.\n\nFor Genuine Spiritual Guidance: Fray Hernando de Talavera - Will keep your soul honest and inspire confidence in your piety.\n\nFor Political Balance & Respectability: Father Íñigo de Mendoza - Safe choice that offends no one.\n\nFor Passionate Advocacy & Loyalty: Fray Pablo de Santa María - Will fight for you intellectually and spiritually, completely devoted to your cause.\n\nMy personal recommendation: Either Fray Pablo de Santa María or Father Alonso de Cartagena. Both are brilliant, both can handle Rome, both are conversos which means they need you more than the nobles—ensuring loyalty.\n\nIf you want someone more focused on spiritual devotion over political skill, Fray Hernando is the choice.\n\nBut Your Majesty, this is deeply personal. You'll be confessing your sins to this man, trusting him with your conscience. Who do you feel drawn to?\"\n\nÁlvaro looks at you expectantly:\n\n\"We can arrange for you to meet any or all of these men before deciding. Or if Your Majesty already knows who feels right, I can have him summoned within days to begin serving as your confessor.\n\nWho would you like to meet, or do you want to make an appointment now?\"\n\nWho interests you as a potential confessor?"

          "text": "This is interesting character development - the King is showing pragmatism and a willingness to be strategic even in spiritual matters. Álvaro would notice this and have thoughts about it.\n\nI should:\n1. Have Álvaro acknowledge the choice and its reasoning\n2. Have Álvaro note the instruction about secrecy - even from the confessor\n3. Perhaps have Álvaro show a moment of concern or respect about the King's willingness to be strategic even in confession\n4. Arrange for Hernando's summoning\n5. Move the conversation forward - what's next? The meeting with the Infantes needs to be arranged, the guard equipment needs to proceed, etc.\n\nÁlvaro's expression shifts—first approval at your choice, then something more complex when you mention managing your confessions. He's silent for a moment, then nods slowly.\n\n\"Fray Hernando de Talavera. A good choice, Your Majesty. His youth and piety will serve you well, and he can indeed keep pace on a demanding journey.\"\n\nHe moves toward the door to summon a messenger, then pauses and turns back, his voice lower:\n\n\"Your Majesty... I understand the need for absolute secrecy. I will share nothing of our full plan with anyone, including Fray Hernando. But...\"\n\nHe chooses his words carefully:\n\n\"Managing one's confessions is a dangerous game, even for kings. The whole point of confession is honesty before God. If you withhold from your confessor, you withhold from your own soul. I'm not a theologian, but I've seen men—powerful men—destroy themselves by lying even in the confessional, thinking they could manage that relationship like any other.\"\n\nHe holds up a hand before you can respond:\n\n\"I say this once, and then never again. I understand the political necessity. Do what you must. But remember: Fray Hernando's value to you in Rome is precisely his genuine piety. If the Pope senses your confessor is just another political tool, it undermines everything.\"\n\nThen his expression clears, back to business:\n\n\"But you are king, and this is your decision. I will say nothing to Fray Hernando beyond that you've chosen him as royal confessor and require his immediate attendance.\"\n\nARRANGING HERNANDO'S ARRIVAL\n\nÁlvaro opens the door and speaks to a guard outside: \"Summon my secretary. Immediately.\"\n\nWithin moments, a clerk appears. Álvaro dictates rapidly:\n\n\"Draft a royal summons to Fray Hernando de Talavera of the Hieronymite Order, currently at the Monastery of Toledo. The King has chosen him to serve as Royal Confessor. He is to depart for Valladolid immediately upon receipt of this message. Send our fastest rider. I want him here within five days.\"\n\nThe secretary bows and hurries off.\n\nÁlvaro turns back to you: \"Toledo is about three days' hard ride from here. The messenger leaves within the hour, reaches the monastery tomorrow evening, Fray Hernando can depart the morning after, and arrives here in three more days. Five days total, possibly four if he rides quickly.\"\n\nIMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS\n\n\"Your Majesty, we have several urgent matters to arrange. Let me summarize what needs to happen immediately:\n\nToday:\n\n✓ Fray Hernando summoned\n\nAuthorization for Captain Fernán's guard equipment already given (he's working on specifications)\n\nContinue meeting with your arriving advisors (Juan de Daza should arrive this afternoon)\n\nThis Week:\n\nArrange the meeting with the Infantes (most critical)\n\nContinue receiving your advisory cabinet as they arrive\n\nBegin planning the pilgrimage logistics\n\nDraft the Royal Council invitations (to discuss with the Infantes)\n\nWithin Two Weeks:\n\nAssemble and dispatch the advance delegation to Rome\n\nFinalize guard equipment orders\n\nMeet with potential bishops/clerics for the Rome journey\n\nTHE INFANTES MEETING - URGENT\n\n\"Your Majesty, we need to arrange this meeting soon. The letter from Infante Juan is waiting for a response, and delay will make them suspicious.\n\nOptions for the meeting:\n\n1. Here in Valladolid\n\nShows confidence—you're receiving them on your ground\n\nYour guards, your palace, your control\n\nBut they might refuse, claiming it's too much like being summoned by a subordinate\n\n2. Neutral Location\n\nPerhaps Medina del Campo (30 miles south—important market town, neutral ground)\n\nShows respect for their position\n\nNeither side has military advantage\n\nTakes 1-2 days to arrange\n\n3. You visit them\n\nShows remarkable confidence or could be seen as weakness\n\nRisky—you're on their territory\n\nBut might flatter them and make them overconfident\n\nMy recommendation: Neutral ground at Medina del Campo. Dignified, appropriate for peers meeting to discuss the realm, neither presumptuous nor weak.\n\nTiming: As soon as possible. I can send a message today proposing we meet in five to seven days—gives them time to travel, gives you time to prepare, and shows you're taking their letter seriously.\n\nWho attends:\n\nYou and perhaps 2-3 attendants (show you're not afraid, not bringing an army)\n\nI should probably attend as Constable (expected) but remain mostly silent—this is your meeting\n\nThey'll bring their own retinue\n\nDoes Your Majesty want me to send that invitation today?\"\n\nHe waits, clearly eager to keep momentum going while you have the initiative.\n\nWhat are your orders? Should we arrange the Infantes meeting? Any other immediate concerns?"

Your wisdom and experience are invaluable to me as I undertake the responsibilities of personal rule.\n\nI would be honored to meet with both of you to discuss matters of importance to Castile. I propose we gather at Medina del Campo in seven days' time, on [specific date]. This market town offers neutral ground appropriate for kinsmen to counsel together.\n\nI look forward to benefiting from your guidance on the establishment of proper governance and other matters affecting the realm.\n\nYour devoted cousin,\nJuan II, by the grace of God King of Castile and León'\"\n\nHe looks up at you: \"Properly deferential, suggests you're taking their advice seriously, but sets you as the one proposing terms. The seven-day timeline gives them adequate notice but not so much time they can coordinate extensively with other nobles first.\"\n\nHe continues to the secretary: \"Send this by fast courier within the hour. I want their response within three days.\"\n\nThe secretary bows and hurries off to prepare the letter for your seal.\n\nMEETING PREPARATION\n\nÁlvaro turns back to you, his voice becoming more instructive:\n\n\"Your Majesty, we have seven days to prepare for what may be the most important conversation of your reign so far. Here's what we need to do:\n\n1. Practice Your Performance\n\nYou need to convincingly play the 'young, earnest king seeking guidance' role. This isn't natural for you—you've been giving orders, showing determination. Now you must seem uncertain, deferential, even a bit overwhelmed.\n\nI suggest we rehearse. I'll play the Infantes—aggressive, condescending, testing you. You practice your responses until they're smooth and believable.\n\n2. Prepare Your Talking Points\n\nWe need to work out exactly what you'll say about:\n\nThe Royal Council (letting them think it's their idea while actually keeping control)\n\nThe pilgrimage to Santiago (gauging their reaction)\n\nYour reliance on me (you need to seem willing to consider reducing my role, but not immediately)\n\nTheir role in governance (showing them respect while not surrendering power)\n\n3. Know Your Limits\n\nWhat will you not concede, even in appearance? We need to establish your red lines so in the moment, you don't accidentally promise something we can't walk back.\n\n4. Read Them\n\nDuring the meeting, observe everything:\n\nDo they seem confident or uncertain?\n\nAre they coordinated or do they disagree on anything?\n\nWho defers to whom?\n\nWhat do they want most desperately?\n\nAre they testing you or trying to make a genuine arrangement?\n\n5. Arrange the Setting\n\nEven at neutral ground, details matter:\n\nWhere you sit relative to them\n\nWho speaks first\n\nHow many attendants each side brings\n\nWhether it's private (just us and them) or with witnesses\n\nMy recommendation: Private meeting, just the four of us initially. More honest conversation, easier for you to play your role, and they'll feel they're getting special access.\"\n\nIMMEDIATE INTERRUPTION\n\nA knock at the door. One of your chamberlains enters and bows:\n\n\"Your Majesty, Juan de Daza has arrived from the treasury offices. He awaits your pleasure.\"\n\nÁlvaro glances at you: \"Your first advisor, Your Majesty. Shall I bring him in now, or would you prefer to prepare first? This is your chance to practice reading a man, assessing loyalty, and giving a first assignment.\"\n\nHe adds quietly: \"Remember—he knows nothing of the full plan. You're simply meeting a treasury official you're considering for a more prominent role. See what he's made of.\"\n\nYou have several immediate choices:\n\nMeet with Juan de Daza now - Begin building your cabinet immediately\n\nPrepare more for the Infantes meeting first - Perhaps practice the deception with Álvaro\n\nReview the Royal Council structure - Finalize details before discussing with the Infantes\n\nSomething else entirely\n\nWhat do you want to do?"

          "text": "Each morning before dawn, you meet Captain Fernán Alonso in the palace courtyard. He's arranged a private space away from prying eyes—just you, him, and perhaps one trusted guard to assist.\n\nThe first morning, he assesses you frankly: \"Your Majesty has the build of a rider, not yet a warrior. We'll change that.\"\n\nHe starts you with basics:\n\nWearing armor: How to move in mail, how to mount a horse in half-armor, how to stand and balance with weight distributed properly\n\nSword work: Not fancy techniques, but practical cuts and guards. \"A king doesn't need to be the best swordsman, Your Majesty, but you must not embarrass yourself or be helpless if attacked.\"\n\nMounted combat: Managing a lance, controlling a warhorse, the basics of a cavalry charge\n\nEndurance: Running in armor, building strength and stamina\n\nFernán is a patient but demanding teacher. \"Again, Your Majesty. Your stance is too narrow—you'll be knocked over.\" He doesn't coddle you.\n\nBy the end of the week, you're sore, bruised, and exhausted each day. But you can wear armor without looking awkward, you can draw and cut with a sword competently, and you're beginning to understand the physical reality of warfare.\n\nFernán seems quietly impressed: \"Your Majesty learns quickly. Keep training like this, and by the time of any campaign, you'll be able to lead from horseback without nobles whispering that you're a boy playing at war.\"\n\nRehearsing with Álvaro\n\nThe afternoons are spent in your private chambers with Álvaro, rehearsing the upcoming meeting.\n\nHe plays the Infantes with cruel accuracy—condescending, testing, subtly aggressive:\n\n\"My dear young cousin, you must understand that kingship requires more than a crown. Your father, God rest him, had the benefit of experienced counselors. You seem to rely so heavily on this... Constable of yours. Is that wise?\"\n\nYou practice responses:\n\nLooking uncertain: \"I... I value Don Álvaro's service, but you're right that I need broader counsel...\"\n\nAsking for their advice: \"What would you suggest, cousin? How should I structure my governance?\"\n\nSeeming overwhelmed: \"Sometimes I feel the weight of so many competing demands...\"\n\nÁlvaro corrects you: \"No, Your Majesty, that was too strong. You sounded confident. Try it again with more hesitation. Pause mid-sentence. Look to me as if seeking support.\"\n\nIt's harder than you expected. Playing weak when you feel strong, uncertain when you're planning several moves ahead. But gradually, you learn the performance.\n\nÁlvaro also teaches you to read them: \"Watch their eyes when you mention the pilgrimage. If they light up, they want you gone. If they look concerned, they're not ready. Watch their hands—if they clench when you talk about me, I'm their primary target.\"\n\nBy the seventh day, you're ready. Or as ready as you can be.\n\nMeeting Your First Advisors\n\nBetween training sessions, you also begin meeting the arriving members of your cabinet:\n\nJuan de Daza arrives first—a careful, observant man in his forties with ink-stained fingers and intelligent eyes. You assign him to quietly track financial flows in Valladolid: \"I want to know where money moves, who's spending unusually, any signs of foreign gold.\" He bows deeply, clearly honored by the attention.\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval, Count of Castro arrives on the third day—a sharp-featured man with a soldier's bearing and a courtier's smooth manner. You assign him to observe the noble factions in the city: \"Who meets with whom, who's corresponding with Aragon, the mood among the great houses.\" He understands immediately: \"Your Majesty, I will be your eyes.\"\n\nThese meetings are brief—you're focused on the Infantes. But you're building your network.\n\nDEPARTURE FOR MEDINA DEL CAMPO\n\nOn the seventh day, a response arrives from the Infantes: they will meet you at Medina del Campo as proposed. The meeting is set for tomorrow.\n\nYou depart that afternoon to arrive by evening, allowing you to rest before the morning meeting.\n\nYOUR TRAVELING COMPANY\n\nStanding in the courtyard as horses are prepared, you survey who will accompany you to this crucial meeting:\n\nÁlvaro de Luna - Of course. As Constable, his presence is expected. He wears traveling clothes but his sword is at his hip, his expression watchful.\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso - Leading your escort. He's transformed over the past week from instructor to something like a personal guard. Clearly takes his responsibility for your safety seriously.\n\nTen Royal Guards - Fernán selected them personally. These are the most reliable men, now wearing their new equipment. They look genuinely impressive—matching mail hauberks, new tabards in red and gold bearing the castle and lion of Castile, good helmets, well-maintained weapons. Not the full thirty, but enough to make a statement without appearing aggressive.\n\nTwo Chamberlains - For protocol and service. One is García Fernández de Manrique, the one Álvaro mentioned has cousins who correspond with the Infantes. You're bringing him deliberately—if he reports back to them, let him report that you seem appropriately respectful and cautious.\n\nA Secretary - To record anything that needs recording, though the main meeting will likely be private.\n\nServants - Four men to handle horses, baggage, and camp if needed.\n\nTotal: About twenty people in your company.\n\nNot an army, but respectable. Not so small you look weak, not so large you look aggressive.\n\nÁlvaro approaches as you're about to mount: \"Your Majesty, remember—uncertain but earnest. You're seeking their guidance, not confronting them. Let them talk, encourage them to reveal their plans, agree to consider their suggestions.\"\n\nHe glances around to ensure no one's listening: \"And observe everything. This meeting tells us how dangerous they truly are.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán helps you check your horse's tack: \"Your Majesty rides in the center of the column. I'll have outriders ahead and behind. If anything seems wrong, we withdraw immediately.\"\n\nTHE JOURNEY\n\nYou ride out through Valladolid's gates in the late afternoon sun. The journey to Medina del Campo is about thirty miles southwest—a good road, well-traveled, through the Castilian plains.\n\nThe spring countryside is beautiful: fields greening, rivers full from winter rains, villages preparing for summer. Your guards ride in formation around you, their new equipment drawing appreciative glances from peasants along the road.\n\nYou arrive at Medina del Campo as the sun is setting. It's a prosperous market town, famous throughout Castile for its fairs. The town officials greet you at the gates with proper ceremony—they've prepared accommodations in the best inn near the main plaza.\n\nThat night, you sleep fitfully. Tomorrow you meet the men who may be your greatest enemies, and you must convince them you're harmless.\n\nTHE MORNING OF THE MEETING\n\nYou wake before dawn. Fernán has guards posted around your lodgings. Álvaro is already awake, reviewing his notes.\n\nThe meeting is set for mid-morning at a private chamber in the town hall—neutral ground arranged by the local magistrate.\n\nAs you dress (your chamberlain helping you into fine but not ostentatious clothing—you want to look kingly but not vain), Álvaro briefs you one final time:\n\n\"The Infantes arrived last night with about fifteen men. Not an army, which is good—they're here to talk. Infante Juan is older, more experienced, more politically sophisticated. Infante Enrique is the warrior, more direct, possibly more dangerous in a different way. Both are proud, both are ambitious.\"\n\nHe pauses: \"Your Majesty, once we're in that room, I can advise but I cannot control what happens. This is your performance. Trust your preparation.\"\n\nAPPROACHING THE MEETING\n\nAt mid-morning, you walk from your inn to the town hall. Your ten guards form up around you—an honor guard, not a threat. The townspeople watch curiously: their king, walking through their streets.\n\nThe town hall is a solid stone building. Officials bow as you enter.\n\nYou're led to a private chamber on the second floor—a room with a large table, windows overlooking the plaza, tapestries on the walls. Chairs are arranged carefully: neither side has a superior position.\n\nAnd there, already waiting, are the Infantes de Aragón.\n\nInfante Juan - Perhaps thirty-five years old, dark-haired and handsome, wearing rich clothing that shows his status as King of Navarra. His eyes are intelligent and measuring. He rises with a smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes.\n\nInfante Enrique - Younger, early thirties, more martial in bearing. He's built like a soldier, and there's something more direct and dangerous in his gaze. He rises with less ceremony.\n\nBehind them stand two advisors and a few attendants.\n\nInfante Juan speaks first, his voice smooth and courteous:\n\n\"Cousin! How good of you to meet with us. Please, sit. We have much to discuss about the welfare of our beloved Castile.\"\n\nÁlvaro stands slightly behind and to your right. Captain Fernán remains by the door with two guards.\n\nThe chamber door closes.\n\nThe Infantes look at you expectantly.\n\nThis is the moment. What do you say? How do you begin?"

          "text": "This is excellent roleplay from the user. They're playing the \"young, earnest, somewhat overwhelmed king\" perfectly - admitting vulnerability, sharing a recent \"failure\" (the guard speech that didn't inspire), showing enthusiasm but also insecurity. This is exactly the kind of performance that would make the Infantes think they can control him.\n\nLet me show how the Infantes react to this. They should:\n1. Be pleased by this apparent weakness\n2. Exchange subtle glances of satisfaction\n3. Play into it by being sympathetic but subtly condescending\n4. Start probing to see how much they can manipulate him\n5. Begin steering the conversation toward their goals\n\nI need to show:\n- The Infantes' body language and reactions\n- Álvaro watching carefully but playing his role of being in the background\n- The power dynamics in the room\n- How they begin to test and probe\n- Their increasing confidence\n\nThis is a critical scene where the user's deception strategy begins. I should make it tense and detailed, showing all the subtle social dynamics at play.\n\nYou shake their hands with genuine-seeming enthusiasm, and you catch the briefest flicker of reaction between the two brothers—a glance, almost imperceptible, that says this is going to be easier than we thought.\n\nInfante Juan's smile warms, becoming almost paternal. \"My dear cousin, please, sit, sit!\" He gestures to a chair. \"You're quite right to feel overwhelmed. Kingship is a tremendous burden, especially when taken up so young.\"\n\nInfante Enrique, the more direct one, actually laughs—not unkindly, but with the tone of an older brother humoring a younger sibling. \"You tried to inspire your guards with a speech? And they just... stood there?\" He shakes his head, grinning. \"I've made that mistake myself, cousin. Soldiers are practical creatures. They care more about their pay and equipment than fine words.\"\n\nJuan shoots his brother a look—let me handle this—then turns back to you with sympathy in his eyes: \"But you see, Your Majesty, this is precisely why we wrote to you. You have the desire to rule well, anyone can see that. But desire isn't enough. You need experienced men around you who can guide you through these... complications.\"\n\nHe settles into his chair, leaning forward slightly, his voice becoming more confidential:\n\n\"Tell me, cousin—when you made this speech to your guards, who advised you on it? Did Don Álvaro suggest this approach?\"\n\nThere's a subtle emphasis on Álvaro's name. Not quite hostile, but... testing.\n\nBehind you, you sense rather than see Álvaro's stillness. He's watching, saying nothing, playing his role.\n\nInfante Enrique adds, less subtly: \"The problem, Your Majesty, is that common soldiers don't really understand what kingship means. They see you as... well, as young as you are.\" He spreads his hands as if this is simply obvious. \"They need to see strength. Decisive action. Not speeches, but results.\"\n\nJuan shoots his brother another look—you're being too blunt—then recovers smoothly:\n\n\"What my brother means is that perhaps your household needs... restructuring. Your guards, your advisors, the men who have your ear daily. These things matter enormously. A king is only as effective as those who serve him.\"\n\nHe pauses, then asks with apparent casualness: \"Tell us, cousin—how are you making decisions these days? When matters of state arise, who do you consult? Just Don Álvaro, or...?\"\n\nThey're probing. Testing how dependent you seem on Álvaro, how isolated you might be, how open you are to their \"guidance.\"\n\nEnrique leans back in his chair, one hand resting on his sword hilt (not threateningly, just habitually), watching your face with those direct, dangerous eyes.\n\nThe chamber feels suddenly smaller. These are not ceremonial courtiers—these are men who've commanded armies, negotiated with kings, survived the vicious politics of the regency. They're assessing you like hunters assessing prey.\n\nHow do you respond? Do you play up your reliance on Álvaro, or distance yourself from him? Do you seem eager for their guidance, or show some independence?"

          "text": "The Infantes would likely see this as:\n- Confirmation he's overwhelmed and unfocused\n- Good news (he's thinking about religion, not consolidating power)\n- Maybe slightly annoying (they asked a direct question and he wandered off topic)\n- An opening to offer \"guidance\" on papal relations\n\nLet me play the Infantes responding to this deflection, showing they're both slightly encouraged by his seeming weakness and trying to steer him back to their agenda while also potentially revealing their thoughts on the Pope/Church.\n\nInfante Juan blinks, clearly not expecting that particular deflection. There's a microsecond of recalibration behind his eyes, then his expression becomes even more sympathetic.\n\n\"Your piety does you credit, cousin,\" he says smoothly. \"The Church is indeed the foundation of any Christian realm. But...\"\n\nHe exchanges a glance with his brother, and you catch something—perhaps mild annoyance that you've changed the subject, or maybe satisfaction that you seem so scattered and anxious.\n\nInfante Enrique is more direct, as usual: \"The Pope has many concerns beyond Castile, Your Majesty. I wouldn't worry overmuch about gifts to Rome when your own kingdom requires such urgent attention.\"\n\nBut Juan raises a hand slightly, silencing his brother. His eyes have narrowed thoughtfully:\n\n\"Actually, Enrique, our cousin raises an interesting point. Tell me, Your Majesty—have you been in correspondence with Rome at all? Has the Holy Father reached out to you since you began your personal rule?\"\n\nThere's genuine curiosity there now, mixed with something else. Political calculation.\n\nHe continues, his voice taking on an advisory tone: \"The relationship between Crown and Church is delicate. The Archbishop of Toledo, for instance, has considerable influence. And Rome... well, Rome can be helpful or troublesome depending on how one manages those relationships.\"\n\nEnrique leans forward: \"What makes you think about the Pope suddenly, cousin? Has someone been advising you to cultivate Rome? The Archbishop perhaps?\"\n\nThey're now probing in a different direction—trying to understand if you have ambitions involving the Church, if someone's been pushing you toward papal politics, if there are alliances being formed they don't know about.\n\nJuan's expression remains warm, but his voice carries a subtle warning: \"I only mention this because securing papal favor often requires... careful navigation. The wrong approach, the wrong messenger, could do more harm than good. If Your Majesty is considering reaching out to Rome, perhaps we could offer guidance on how such things are properly done?\"\n\nBehind you, Álvaro remains silent, but you can almost feel his approval. You've successfully deflected their initial probe and planted the seed about Rome without revealing your actual plans.\n\nEnrique, growing impatient with the indirect conversation, speaks more bluntly: \"Look, cousin, let's be honest. You said yourself you're overwhelmed. You tried to rally your guards and failed. You're worried about the Pope. These are all signs you need proper counsel.\"\n\nHe gestures broadly: \"What you need is a council of the realm's natural leaders—men who've actually governed, fought wars, managed diplomacy. Not just one man, no matter how capable Don Álvaro might be in his way, but a proper council of the great houses of Castile.\"\n\nJuan shoots his brother a look—too fast, too obvious—but Enrique continues: \"Your father and grandfather ruled with such councils. It's the traditional way. The King listens to his nobles, makes decisions with their counsel. That's how Castile has always worked best.\"\n\nJuan recovers smoothly: \"What my brother means is simply that shared wisdom leads to better governance. No one man—no one young man, if you'll forgive me—should bear all these burdens alone.\"\n\nHe leans forward, his voice becoming almost intimate: \"Your Majesty, we're family. We only want to help. Tell us honestly—what do you need most right now? Guidance on governance? Help managing the nobles? Military leadership? Surely there's something we can assist with?\"\n\nThey're making their pitch now, trying to position themselves as indispensable helpers.\n\nHow do you respond? Do you take the bait about needing their help? Do you return to the Pope topic? Do you bring up the idea of a council?"

Seeming frustrated and overwhelmed by competing interests\n3. Playing into their hands by acting like the council is their idea and asking for their input\n4. Looking weak and uncertain - exactly what they expect\n\nThe Infantes will eat this up. They'll think they're manipulating a naive young king who's frustrated with his current advisors.\n\nLet me show them being pleased, offering detailed suggestions about the council composition, revealing their plans and allies, while also maybe showing some internal disagreement between the two brothers about tactics or specific people.\n\nThe effect on the Infantes is immediate and visible.\n\nInfante Juan's expression lights up—genuine pleasure mixed with barely concealed triumph. Infante Enrique actually grins and slaps the table lightly.\n\n\"There! You see, Juan? Our cousin understands!\" Enrique says enthusiastically. \"A council is exactly what's needed!\"\n\nJuan shoots his brother a warning look—don't show too much eagerness—then turns back to you with warm approval:\n\n\"Your Majesty shows wisdom beyond your years. Yes, everyone has their own interests—that's the nature of power. The Archbishop wants Church influence, Don Álvaro wants...\" he pauses delicately, \"...to maintain his position, the great houses want their traditional privileges. This is precisely why a council balances these competing interests.\"\n\nHe pulls his chair closer, becoming almost conspiratorial:\n\n\"Now, as for composition, this is crucial. A council must have weight—men who command real authority in the realm, not just ceremonial appointments. Let me suggest...\"\n\nHe begins counting on his fingers:\n\n\"First, the royal family itself. My brother and I, naturally—we have blood ties to the throne, estates throughout Castile, and experience in governance and war. This shows the Crown values family counsel.\"\n\nEnrique nods vigorously: \"And it sends a message to Aragon that Castile is united, that there's no conflict between our kingdoms.\"\n\nJuan continues: \"Second, the great military orders. The Masters of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara. They command significant military force and their support is essential. Leaving them out would be... unwise.\"\n\n\"Third, the highest Church authority—the Archbishop of Toledo, of course. Since he's already writing to you about papal relations,\" Juan's voice carries a slight edge here, \"he'll expect to be included. Besides, Church backing legitimizes the council's decisions.\"\n\nEnrique interjects: \"Though we should be careful the Archbishop doesn't dominate. Clerics have their place, but this is about governing the realm, not just spiritual matters.\"\n\nJuan nods agreement: \"Fourth, representatives from the greatest noble houses. The Mendozas—they're powerful and must be accommodated. Perhaps the head of the Mendoza family?\"\n\nHe pauses thoughtfully: \"The Estúñigas, the Velascos... these families control vast territories. If they're excluded, they'll resent it and cause problems.\"\n\nEnrique adds: \"We want men who are already powerful, cousin. That way, when the council makes decisions, those decisions actually matter. If you just appoint minor nobles or favorites, the great houses will ignore it.\"\n\nJuan continues: \"Fifth—and this is delicate—some representation from the cities. Burgos, Seville, Toledo, perhaps Valladolid. The merchant classes and urban militias have real power. A purely noble council might alienate them.\"\n\n\"Though not too many city representatives,\" Enrique warns. \"This is still a council of the realm's natural leaders, not a merchants' guild.\"\n\nJuan leans back, calculating: \"So we're talking about... perhaps fifteen to twenty men total? Large enough to represent the realm's major powers, small enough to actually function.\"\n\nThen he looks at you directly, his voice becoming more pointed:\n\n\"Now, Your Majesty, here's the critical question: how does this council function? Is it purely advisory—you listen and then decide? Or does it have actual authority—certain decisions require the council's consent?\"\n\nEnrique leans forward eagerly: \"In my view, major decisions should require the council's agreement. Declaring war, raising extraordinary taxes, making treaties with foreign powers, appointing high officials—these things shouldn't be done by royal decree alone.\"\n\nJuan gives his brother a sharp look—too much, too fast—then moderates: \"What my brother means is that the council should have meaningful input. Not that it binds Your Majesty's hands entirely, but that on truly important matters, you have the benefit of collective wisdom before acting.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds carefully: \"And of course, the council should meet regularly. Monthly? Quarterly? Often enough to be relevant, not so often it becomes burdensome.\"\n\nEnrique, warming to the topic: \"And Your Majesty, perhaps the council could also... advise on your personal household? The men who have your daily ear, who manage the treasury, who command your guards? After all, these positions affect the whole realm.\"\n\nThere it is—the real goal. Control over your appointments.\n\nJuan shoots his brother an irritated look, then tries to soften it: \"What Enrique means is simply that transparency about royal household appointments reassures the nobility that positions of power aren't being monopolized by any one faction.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes: \"For instance, Don Álvaro currently holds multiple crucial positions—Constable, chief advisor, essentially first minister. This... concentration of power in one man's hands creates anxiety among other nobles. Not that Don Álvaro is incompetent, but the appearance matters.\"\n\nBehind you, Álvaro remains perfectly still. You can almost feel his tension.\n\nEnrique presses: \"With a proper council, that power could be distributed. Different men handling different responsibilities. More balanced, more stable.\"\n\nJuan adds smoothly: \"And it would actually strengthen your position, Your Majesty, because you'd no longer be seen as dependent on any one man. You'd be seen as ruling with the realm's collective wisdom.\"\n\nThey're both watching you intently now, trying to gauge your reaction to this suggestion that you should dilute or remove Álvaro's power.\n\nHow do you respond? Do you seem open to limiting Álvaro's role? Do you ask more questions? Do you express concerns?"

Framing it as trusting them, which plays into the \"pliant young king\" persona\n\nLet me write the Infantes' reaction. They should:\n- Be momentarily thrown by the pushback on the council (he's not as pliable as they thought?)\n- Then become VERY interested in the pilgrimage idea\n- Probably exchange glances about this opportunity\n- Try not to seem TOO eager (that would be suspicious)\n- Ask questions about timeline, where he's going, what \"temporary administration\" means\n- Possibly one is more cautious, one is more eager\n\nÁlvaro behind the user is probably having a heart attack internally but staying quiet as instructed.\n\nThe Infantes go very still.\n\nFor a moment, the chamber is silent. You've just done two things simultaneously—pushed back gently on their immediate demands, then offered them something potentially much more valuable.\n\nInfante Juan's eyes narrow slightly. He exchanges a long, meaningful look with his brother. You can almost see the calculation happening behind their faces.\n\nInfante Enrique speaks first, unable to contain himself: \"A pilgrimage? Where would Your Majesty—\"\n\nJuan cuts him off with a subtle gesture, his voice carefully measured: \"Cousin, your piety is admirable. Truly. But...\" he pauses, choosing words carefully, \"a pilgrimage at this moment? With the realm requiring your attention? Your advisors are right to counsel caution.\"\n\nBut there's something in his eyes—interest, possibility, hunger barely concealed.\n\nEnrique can't help himself: \"Where were you thinking of going? Santiago de Compostela? That's a worthy pilgrimage, and not too far—\"\n\nJuan shoots his brother a sharp look—let me handle this—then turns back to you with an expression of concerned sympathy:\n\n\"Your Majesty, forgive me, but I must ask: whose idea was this pilgrimage? Did someone suggest this to you?\"\n\nThere's suspicion there now. They're wondering if this is a trick, if someone is trying to get you away from them, if Álvaro or another faction is manipulating you.\n\nBehind you, you sense Álvaro's complete stillness. This is the crucial moment.\n\nJuan continues, his voice soft but probing: \"And you mentioned returning 'in time for the first council'—are you saying you wish to establish the council, then depart on pilgrimage? Or depart first, and convene the council upon your return?\"\n\nEnrique leans forward: \"How long would you be gone, cousin? A few weeks? Months?\"\n\nJuan adds, his tone becoming more pointed: \"And you mentioned we would 'keep council and keep the administration running'—what exactly does that mean? Would you be establishing a formal regency? With what powers? For how long?\"\n\nThey're simultaneously intrigued and suspicious. The opportunity is tantalizing—you gone, them in charge—but it seems too convenient. They're trying to figure out if this is genuine naivety or a trap.\n\nEnrique, more direct as always: \"Your Majesty, no offense, but this seems sudden. Just moments ago we were discussing a council structure, and now you want to leave on pilgrimage? What's really driving this?\"\n\nJuan's expression becomes almost paternal, but his eyes are sharp: \"Cousin, I wonder if this impulse comes from feeling overwhelmed? You mentioned it yourself—everyone wants something, the weight of kingship is tremendous. Perhaps you're thinking of pilgrimage as an escape?\"\n\nHe leans forward, his voice becoming more intimate: \"But running away—and forgive me, but that's what pilgrimage now would look like to many nobles—would only make things worse. It would make you seem weak, uncertain, unable to handle royal responsibility.\"\n\nEnrique nods vigorously: \"The realm needs a king present, cousin. Not wandering on distant roads while nobles squabble over who's really in charge.\"\n\nBut Juan is still calculating. You can see him weighing possibilities. Finally, he asks carefully:\n\n\"Tell me more about this pilgrimage. Where specifically? For how long? And most importantly—what authority would my brother and I have in your absence? Would we simply advise Don Álvaro, or would you establish a proper regency council with actual governing power?\"\n\nHis voice hardens slightly: \"Because if you're proposing to leave Don Álvaro in charge while merely consulting us, that accomplishes nothing. But if you're proposing a genuine regency council, with authority to make decisions, issue orders, manage the realm... that's different.\"\n\nEnrique adds bluntly: \"And what about military authority? Command of royal forces and fortifications? Control of the treasury? These things matter, cousin.\"\n\nThey're negotiating now, trying to figure out exactly what they'd get out of this arrangement. The bait is tempting, but they're not fools—they want specifics.\n\nJuan sits back, studying your face: \"Your Majesty, I appreciate your trust in us. But help me understand: why propose this now? Why not wait until you're more established, until the council structure is in place, until the realm is more stable? What drives this sudden desire for pilgrimage?\"\n\nHis eyes search yours, looking for deception, for manipulation, for any sign that you're not as guileless as you seem.\n\nBehind you, Álvaro maintains his silence, but the tension in the room has ratcheted up considerably.\n\nHow do you answer their questions? What details do you provide about the pilgrimage? How much authority do you offer them?"

They're directly challenging the Infantes, calling out the power grab, putting them on the defensive while still maintaining the \"young and uncertain\" persona. This is actually quite clever - it forces the Infantes to either:\n\n1. Admit they want power (which makes them look like usurpers)\n2. Back down and accept less than they wanted\n3. Try to negotiate middle ground\n\nThe player is also creating a false binary - either they help on his terms, or they're trying to depose him. This puts pressure on them.\n\nThe Infantes would be caught off-guard by this directness. They've been treating him like a naive boy, and suddenly he's speaking plainly about civil war and deposing. They need to recalibrate.\n\nJuan would likely try to recover diplomatically, denying any intent to depose while still pressing for concessions. Enrique might be more flustered. Behind them, Álvaro would be impressed but also concerned - this is riskier than the planned approach.\n\nLet me write their reaction.\n\nThe room goes completely silent.\n\nThe Infantes stare at you, clearly not expecting this directness. For a moment, the masks slip entirely.\n\nInfante Enrique actually flushes, his hand moving instinctively toward his sword hilt before he catches himself. \"Depose you? Cousin, that's—\"\n\nJuan holds up a hand, silencing his brother. His expression has gone very cold, very calculating. When he speaks, his voice is quiet and measured:\n\n\"Your Majesty, no one has spoken of deposing anyone.\" Each word is careful, controlled. \"But let's not pretend at naivety now—you just demonstrated you understand politics better than you've been letting on.\"\n\nHe stands slowly, walking to the window, his back to you for a moment. When he turns back, his diplomatic warmth is gone, replaced by something harder:\n\n\"You're right. We don't trust Don Álvaro. And frankly, cousin, you shouldn't either—not completely. A man who holds that much power over a young king is dangerous, whether his intentions are good or not.\"\n\nEnrique leans forward, his voice rougher: \"And you're also right that we want more than we have now. Why shouldn't we? We're of royal blood, we have armies, estates, experience. We don't want to depose you—we want to help govern. There's a difference.\"\n\nJuan returns to his seat, his eyes locked on yours: \"So let me be equally blunt, cousin. You came here asking for help. We're offering it. But help means actual authority, not ceremonial positions. If you go on pilgrimage and leave Don Álvaro in complete control, you're not sharing power—you're consolidating his.\"\n\nHe pauses, then speaks more softly: \"Here's what concerns me: you speak of preventing civil war. Good. That shows wisdom. But civil war comes when legitimate powers feel excluded, when the realm's natural leaders are shut out by a single man's monopoly on the king.\"\n\nEnrique adds: \"Right now, cousin, dozens of nobles are watching. They see you, young and untested, seemingly controlled by one man. That breeds resentment. If you continue down that path—especially if you leave him in charge while you're gone—that resentment will grow.\"\n\nJuan leans forward: \"So yes, you're offering us more than we have now. You're acknowledging we should have a voice. But how much of a voice? That's the question. Because an advisory council that Álvaro ignores accomplishes nothing except making us complicit in his rule.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes directly: \"Here's a compromise. You want Álvaro to manage day-to-day administration—fine. He's competent, I'll grant him that. But establish a regency council—the three of us, perhaps one or two others—that must approve major decisions. Not routine matters, but significant ones: military deployments, major expenditures, diplomatic treaties, appointments to high office.\"\n\nEnrique nods: \"That way, the realm sees shared governance. Álvaro runs things day-to-day, but the council provides oversight and approval for important matters. Everyone has a stake.\"\n\nJuan adds quietly: \"And when you return from pilgrimage, we convene your larger council and discuss permanent arrangements. But in the interim, this prevents any one man—Don Álvaro or anyone else—from having unchecked power.\"\n\nBehind you, you hear Álvaro shift slightly. This is the first sound he's made since the meeting began.\n\nJuan watches you carefully: \"That's our offer, cousin. Real partnership, not ceremonial window dressing. Can you accept that?\"\n\nWhat do you say?"

You see? When we speak plainly, we can accomplish much.\"\n\nJuan releases your hand, his expression warm: \"Your Majesty shows wisdom. This arrangement serves everyone—you get your pilgrimage and spiritual guidance, we ensure the realm is properly governed in your absence, Don Álvaro keeps his administrative role. Balance.\"\n\nBehind you, Álvaro finally speaks, his voice carefully neutral: \"Your Majesty is generous.\" There's something complex in his tone—approval of the performance you're giving, but also awareness that this will constrain him significantly for the next several months.\n\nJuan turns businesslike: \"We should formalize this arrangement. A written charter before you depart, specifying the regency council's composition and powers. Clear, so there's no confusion.\"\n\nEnrique nods: \"The council should be you two, myself, and perhaps one other—someone respected and neutral. The head of the Mendoza family? They're powerful enough to balance us.\"\n\nJuan considers: \"Agreed. Four members—my brother, myself, one Mendoza, and perhaps a Church representative? The Archbishop of Toledo or a bishop?\"\n\nHe looks at you: \"And to be clear on powers—the council approves or rejects major military deployments, expenditures over a certain amount, diplomatic treaties, and appointments to positions like corregidores in major cities or military governorships. Day-to-day administration remains with Don Álvaro and the existing bureaucracy.\"\n\nEnrique adds: \"We'll meet weekly while you're gone, keep records, ensure transparency.\"\n\nJuan extends his hand again: \"Partners in governing Castile, cousin.

Military supplies for frontier garrisons alone can exceed that. Perhaps 200,000 would be more practical?\"\n\nJuan considers: \"A reasonable point. We don't want to micromanage every transaction. 200,000 maravedís then.\"\n\nEnrique adds: \"And the military deployment threshold—one thousand men seems right. Large enough to matter, not so small we're approving every border patrol.\"\n\nJuan looks at you: \"Any other provisions Your Majesty wishes to include? Time limits on Council sessions?

Witnesses from the major noble houses currently in Valladolid. Perhaps make it a ceremonial occasion in your throne room?\"\n\nEnrique adds: \"And then you could depart shortly after? Within days? The weather's good for travel now, and the sooner you go, the sooner you return.\"\n\nJuan looks at you appraisingly: \"Your Majesty, you've changed my opinion today. I came here thinking... well, never mind what I thought. But you've shown you can be decisive when needed. This arrangement will serve Castile well.\"\n\nBehind you, Álvaro finally speaks, his voice carefully neutral: \"Shall we return to Valladolid, Your Majesty? Much to prepare.\"\n\nDo you want to conclude the meeting and head back? Anything else to discuss with the Infantes?"

          "text": "What the Infantes got:\n- A regency council with actual authority (not just advisory)\n- Power to approve major military deployments, large expenditures, diplomatic treaties, high appointments\n- Weekly meetings with decision-making power\n- Álvaro constrained - he can't act unilaterally on major decisions\n- The King will be gone for 4 months\n- A larger council meeting in 6 months that they think they'll dominate\n\nWhat changes the calculation:\n- They think they've WON. They got significant concessions.\n- Open rebellion would destroy what they just gained\n- They have a legal path to power now through the regency council\n- The King seemed pliant and willing to share power\n- They believe this is the beginning of them controlling governance\n\nWhy they probably WON'T revolt:\n1. They just got much of what they wanted through negotiation\n2. Rebellion would be risky and bloody when they have a legal path\n3. They think the King is manageable and will continue to make concessions\n4. The regency council gives them real power without the stigma of rebellion\n5. They're counting on the 6-month council to cement their position permanently\n\nWhy they MIGHT still act:\n1. If they discover the true plan (Rome, crusade, papal backing)\n2. If Álvaro tries to circumvent the regency council\n3. If they get impatient or sense they're being deceived\n4. If other nobles push them to act more decisively\n\nOverall assessment: This should be rated as LIKELY TO SUCCEED in preventing revolt during the pilgrimage, with some caveats.\n\nThe monarch crafted a strategic compromise, offering substantive influence without completely surrendering royal prerogatives. By carefully calibrating the power distribution, he's neutralized immediate threats while maintaining his core authority.\n\nPROBABILITY ASSESSMENT: Will the Infantes Revolt During Your Pilgrimage?\n\nLIKELY TO SUCCEED (in preventing revolt)\n\nLet me analyze what you've accomplished and what could still go wrong:\n\nFACTORS WORKING IN YOUR FAVOR\n\n1. They Think They've Won\n\nThis is your greatest protection. The Infantes came to this meeting expecting to pressure a weak young king. Instead, you:\n\nAcknowledged their concerns about Álvaro\n\nAgreed to create exactly the council structure they wanted\n\nGave them REAL power through the regency council\n\nMade them feel like wise elder statesmen guiding a grateful nephew\n\nThey're leaving this meeting satisfied, even triumphant. Men who think they're winning don't rebel.\n\n2. They Have a Legal Path to Power\n\nWhy risk rebellion when they just secured:\n\nAuthority over major military deployments\n\nControl over large expenditures\n\nVeto power on important appointments\n\nWeekly meetings where they can block Álvaro\n\nA larger council in 6 months they expect to dominate\n\nRebellion is bloody, expensive, and uncertain. They now have a bloodless path to controlling Castile's governance.\n\n3. Open Rebellion Would Destroy Their Gains\n\nIf they rebel now, they:\n\nBreak an agreement they just made publicly\n\nLook dishonorable and treacherous\n\nLose the legitimacy of the regency council\n\nUnite other nobles against them (who would fear similar treatment)\n\nRisk everything in civil war\n\n4. You Played Your Role Well\n\nYou convinced them you're:\n\nGenuinely overwhelmed and seeking help\n\nPious and earnest (the pilgrimage desire seemed authentic)\n\nWilling to share power (not trying to be an autocrat)\n\nManageable (they think they can continue to guide/control you)\n\nThis makes them confident they don't need violence—political manipulation will suffice.\n\n5. Time Is On Their Side (They Think)\n\nFrom their perspective:\n\nYou'll be gone 4 months—they govern during that time\n\nYou return for a council they expect to control\n\nYour \"permanent\" arrangements will favor them\n\nWhy rush when the trajectory is already in their favor?\n\nREMAINING RISKS\n\n1. If They Discover Your True Plans\n\nIf they learn about:\n\nYour advance delegation to Rome\n\nThe crusade negotiations\n\nYour intention to use papal authority to override them\n\nThat the pilgrimage is cover for political maneuvering\n\nThen they'd feel deceived and might act preemptively. But you've kept this tight—only you and Álvaro know.\n\n2. If Álvaro Overplays His Hand\n\nIf Álvaro tries to circumvent the regency council, ignores their authority, or makes major decisions without consulting them, they could claim he's violating the agreement and move to \"enforce\" it with troops.\n\nThis is actually a real risk—Álvaro will hate being constrained, and he might try to work around them.\n\n3. If Other Nobles Push Them\n\nSome of their supporters might argue: \"Why wait? The king is gone, you have a council, just declare a permanent regency and be done with it.\"\n\nBut Juan seems politically sophisticated enough to resist this. He knows patience often wins what haste loses.\n\n4. If Something Goes Wrong With Your Journey\n\nIf you're delayed, captured, fall seriously ill, or don't return when promised, the situation becomes unstable. They might claim regency needs to become permanent \"until His Majesty recovers/returns.\"\n\n5. The Mendoza Variable\n\nYou're putting Íñigo López de Mendoza on the regency council. If the Mendozas decide to side more firmly with the Infantes, that's three of four council members against Álvaro. They could effectively govern without rebellion.\n\nBut if the Mendozas stay neutral or lean toward the crown, they balance the Infantes.\n\nTHE VERDICT: LIKELY TO SUCCEED\n\nProbability they DON'T revolt during your pilgrimage: 70-75%\n\nHere's why it's not higher:\n\nYou gave them real power, which satisfies them, but you also constrained yourself significantly. The regency council isn't just theater—it actually limits what Álvaro can do while you're gone.\n\nThe Infantes will spend your absence:\n\nTesting the limits of the regency council\n\nConsolidating their position\n\nMaking appointments favorable to them\n\nBuilding support for the November gathering\n\nTrying to win over neutral nobles\n\nThey're playing the long game now because you gave them a path to win it.\n\nHowever, this means:\n\nYou'll return to a realm where they've strengthened their position\n\nThe November council will be more challenging than if you'd kept them weaker\n\nÁlvaro will be frustrated and possibly undermined\n\nYou'll need that papal crusade bull to be VERY impressive to override their momentum\n\nCRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS\n\nFor this to work as planned:\n\nKeep the Rome plan absolutely secret - Any leak and they move immediately\n\nReturn on time - Being late creates dangerous uncertainty\n\nGet that crusade bull - Without it, you return to a stronger Infantes faction\n\nÁlvaro must respect the regency council - Even while hating it, or they'll claim violation\n\nKeep the Mendozas neutral - Don't let them fully align with the Infantes\n\nThe Gamble: You've traded 4 months of increased Infantes power for freedom to secure papal backing. If you return with that crusade bull and papal authority, the temporary concessions become irrelevant. If you return empty-handed, you've weakened your position significantly.\n\nYour performance was convincing, your concessions were substantial enough to be believed, and you left them feeling victorious. This should buy you the time you need.\n\nBut you're now racing against time—secure that papal backing and return before they consolidate too much power."

          "text": "# Chapter 1: The Young King's Gambit\n## Kingdom of Castile, Spring 1430\n\n### Opening Situation\n\n**Date**: Early May 1430  \n**Location**: Royal Palace, Valladolid\n\nJuan II of Castile, age 18, stands at the beginning of his personal rule after years of regency. He surveys a kingdom in precarious balance:\n\n**Kingdom Status:**\n- **Treasury**: Strained but functional (~30 million maravedís annual revenue, ~28 million expenses)\n- **Military Strength**: Moderate and divided (3,000 royal troops, ~15,000-20,000 potential feudal levies)\n- **Noble Loyalty**: CRITICAL CONCERN - fractious nobility, power struggles\n- **Popular Support**: Cautiously positive but distant\n- **Foreign Relations**: Tense with Aragon, uneasy peace with Granada, correct relations with Portugal\n\n**Primary Threats:**\n- The **Infantes de Aragón** (Juan and Enrique) - powerful princes with estates in Castile, commanding noble factions, seeking to control the young king\n- **Álvaro de Luna** - the King's Constable and closest advisor, deeply hated by nobles who see him as a low-born upstart monopolizing power\n- Fractious nobility ready to exploit any weakness\n- Economic pressures and inefficient taxation (20% revenue lost to corruption)\n\n### The Decision to Act\n\nAfter reading urgent letters from Seville (noble feuds, Infantes' influence, foreign gold), Toledo (Archbishop urging crusade), the frontier (Granada skirmishes, need for supplies), and a letter from Infante Juan himself (offering \"counsel\" that thinly veils demands for control), Juan II makes a fateful declaration:\n\n**\"This abuse ends now and forever. I will determine my own actions.\"**\n\nWith Álvaro de Luna, he begins planning not just survival, but transformation of Castilian governance.\n\n### Building the Foundation\n\n**Securing the Palace:**\n- Assessment of loyal forces: Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles and ~20-25 truly loyal royal guards\n- Review of treasury and financial situation\n- Understanding the mechanisms of noble control: information monopoly, institutional capture, military reality, physical control of the king's person\n\n**The Guard Assembly** (FAILED ACTION):\nJuan attempts to inspire personal loyalty in his 30-man royal guard with a speech about divine purpose, expanded roles, and promises of better equipment. The attempt falls flat - the guards respond professionally but without passion. The king learns that words alone don't create devotion.\n\nRecovery: Juan acknowledges his mortality and inexperience, earning grudging respect. He authorizes 150,000 maravedís for guard equipment (mail hauberks, matching weapons, proper livery) and begins working with Captain Fernán on practical matters.\n\n**Assembling an Advisory Cabinet:**\nJuan decides to build his own intelligence network, summoning:\n- **Juan de Daza** - Treasury official, commoner, to track money flows and urban intelligence\n- **Diego Gómez de Sandoval** (Count of Castro) - Converso noble, to observe court factions\n- **Lope de Barrientos** - Dominican scholar from Salamanca, for Church networks\n- **Íñigo López de Mendoza** - Young Mendoza family member, poet and observer\n- **Rodrigo Manrique** - Frontier soldier, for military intelligence\n\n### The Grand Strategy\n\nIn private counsel with Álvaro de Luna, Juan develops an audacious multi-part plan:\n\n**1. Create a Royal Council** - Give nobles formal access while retaining real control\n\n**2. Secure Papal Backing** - Travel to Rome personally to obtain:\n- Crusade bull against Granada\n- Papal endorsement of his rule\n- Support for governance reforms\n\n**3. Launch Crusade Against Granada** - Use holy war to:\n- Unite fractious nobles behind common cause\n- Provide religious justification for taxation\n- Demonstrate royal leadership\n- Win glory and prestige\n\n**4. Reform Taxation** - Under cover of crusade necessity, fix the inefficient system where 20% of revenue is lost to corruption and nobles pay almost nothing\n\n**5. Centralize Military Authority** - Create unified royal command for the crusade, establishing precedent for permanent standing army\n\n**The Rome Journey Debate:**\nÁlvaro warns that a 4-6 month absence is extremely dangerous - the Infantes could seize control, establish a regency, or move against royal interests. Multiple approaches debated:\n- Send Álvaro instead (safer but less impactful)\n- Send a powerful embassy (respectable but lacks personal touch)\n- Go with massive security (expensive, slow, conspicuous)\n- Go in secret (risky if discovered, looks weak)\n- Semi-public pilgrimage (honest but still dangerous)\n\nJuan insists on going personally - the Pope needs to see his sincerity and youth. Personal diplomacy could accomplish what no letter could achieve.\n\n### Understanding the Enemy\n\n**Why Don't the Infantes Act Now?**\n- **Legitimacy matters**: Juan is anointed king; open rebellion invites excommunication and condemnation\n- **They prefer control to overthrow**: Keep Juan as figurehead while governing in fact\n- **They're not united enough yet**: Civil war outcome is uncertain\n- **Juan is present and alert**: Hard to claim he needs \"rescue\" when visibly ruling\n- **They have a legal path**: Political pressure might work without violence\n\n**What Changes If Juan Leaves:**\n- Legitimacy argument shifts to \"abandoned realm needs temporary governance\"\n- Royal supporters can't rally to an absent king\n- Infantes control the narrative\n- They can seize strategic positions without fighting Juan personally\n\n**Álvaro's Supporters Assessment:**\n- **Definitely Loyal**: Álvaro himself, ~30-40 royal officials, Captain Fernán and core guards, the new advisory cabinet\n- **Probably Supportive**: Major cities/merchants, much of Church hierarchy, Mendoza family (conditionally)\n- **Neutral/Watching**: Most middling nobles, Military Orders\n- **Actively Opposed**: Infantes' faction (~8-10 major houses, 25% of military power)\n\n**Reality**: Most of Castile is neutral rather than loyal. Juan inherits a throne without a faction - he must build support from nothing.\n\n### Choosing a Confessor\n\nJuan learns his previous confessor, Father Gonzalo, died last winter. He has been between confessors. This becomes crucial for the Rome journey.\n\n**Choice**: **Fray Hernando de Talavera**\n- Age ~32, young Hieronymite monk\n- Humble background, extreme personal piety\n- Genuinely holy, morally rigorous\n- Young enough to keep pace on demanding journey\n- No political connections - completely dependent on royal favor\n- Would inspire confidence in Rome about Juan's spiritual sincerity\n\nSummoned immediately from Toledo monastery.\n\n**Critical Decision**: Juan tells Álvaro that only they two will know the full plan. Juan will \"manage his confessions\" as needed - a dangerous game that Álvaro warns against.\n\n### Week of Preparation\n\n**Combat Training with Captain Fernán:**\nDaily dawn sessions learning:\n- How to move and fight in armor\n- Practical sword work (cuts and guards)\n- Mounted combat and lance work\n- Building endurance and strength\n\nBy week's end: sore, bruised, exhausted, but competent. Can wear armor without looking awkward and handle weapons credibly.\n\n**Rehearsing Deception with Álvaro:**\nPracticing the role of \"young, earnest king seeking guidance\" - appearing uncertain, overwhelmed, deferential. Harder than expected to play weak when feeling strong. Learning to read the Infantes' reactions.\n\n**Meeting First Advisors:**\n- **Juan de Daza**: Assigned to track financial flows in Valladolid\n- **Diego Gómez de Sandoval**: Assigned to observe noble factions\n\nBuilding the intelligence network begins.\n\n### The Meeting at Medina del Campo\n\n**Date**: May 6, 1430 (one week after initial planning)  \n**Location**: Medina del Campo, neutral market town 30 miles from Valladolid\n\n**Juan's Company:**\n- Álvaro de Luna (Constable)\n- Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles\n- 10 royal guards (in new equipment - impressive)\n- 2 chamberlains (including one with Infantes connections)\n- Secretary and 4 servants\n- Total: ~20 people\n\n**The Infantes:**\n- **Infante Juan de Aragón**: ~35, King of Navarra, intelligent, politically sophisticated\n- **Infante Enrique de Aragón**: Early 30s, martial, direct, more dangerous in different way\n- ~15-man retinue\n\n### The Negotiation\n\n**Opening Gambit** (Juan's Performance):\nJuan plays the overwhelmed young king - shaking hands enthusiastically, admitting his failed guard speech, showing relief at meeting them. The Infantes visibly relax, thinking this will be easy.\n\n**The Infantes' Initial Probe:**\n- Who advised the failed speech? (Testing Juan's reliance on Álvaro)\n- Who does Juan consult on decisions? (Assessing isolation)\n- Suggesting Juan needs \"experienced men of noble blood\"\n\n**Juan's Deflection:**\nShifts to discussing piety, church importance, not having sent gift to Pope yet. This unexpected turn confuses them briefly - is he scattered and anxious, or changing subject deliberately?\n\n**The Infantes Pivot:**\n- Ask about correspondence with Rome\n- Warn about Archbishop of Toledo's influence\n- Offer to guide proper papal relations\n- Push for formal council of \"realm's natural leaders\"\n\n**Juan's Counter:**\nAdmits feeling overwhelmed by competing demands: \"everyone seems to want something for themselves while the realm suffers.\"\n\nThen: **\"I like the idea of a council. Who should we invite you think?\"**\n\n**The Infantes Take the Bait:**\nEnthusiastically outline council structure:\n- Royal family (themselves)\n- Military Orders (Masters of Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara)\n- Archbishop of Toledo\n- Great noble houses (Mendozas, Estúñigas, Velascos, etc.)\n- City representatives (Burgos, Seville, Toledo, Valladolid)\n- 15-20 members total\n- Should have \"meaningful input\" on major decisions\n- Meet regularly\n- Should \"advise\" on royal household appointments (targeting Álvaro)\n\nThey argue for binding authority, monthly meetings, power over appointments.\n\n**Juan's Critical Pivot:**\nSuggests going on **pilgrimage** - wants to find spiritual clarity, just lost his confessor. Offers: \"Would you be willing to keep council and keep the administration running in my absence?\"\n\n**The Infantes' Response:**\nInitial surprise and suspicion (whose idea? how long? what authority?), but clear interest in the opportunity. They probe for details while trying not to seem too eager.\n\n**The Confrontation:**\nWhen Juan says Álvaro would \"take his place\" during absence, Infantes push back hard:\n- That's not sharing power, just current arrangement with Juan absent\n- Want actual regency authority, not advisory role\n- Accuse Álvaro of monopolizing power\n\n**Juan's Bold Move:**\n\"Cousins, now is my turn to be blunt... Please tell me you do not want to depose me and rule as de-facto king in my stead while I am away.\"\n\nShocked silence. Masks drop. Then careful responses:\n- Deny deposing, but admit wanting real authority\n- Argue concentration of power in Álvaro creates instability\n- Warn that excluded nobles breed resentment leading to civil war\n\n**The Compromise:**\nInfantes propose: Álvaro manages day-to-day administration, but regency council (the two Infantes + Archbishop + one Mendoza) must approve major decisions:\n- Military deployments over 1,000 men\n- Expenditures over 200,000 maravedís\n- Diplomatic treaties\n- High office appointments\n- War/peace declarations\n\nWeekly meetings, majority vote (3 of 4), documented decisions.\n\n**Juan's Response:**\nHolds out his hand: **\"Done.\"**\n\n### The Agreement\n\n**Regency Council During Pilgrimage:**\n- **Members**: Infante Juan, Infante Enrique, Archbishop of Toledo, Íñigo López de Mendoza\n- **Duration**: Juan's departure until return (~4-6 months)\n- **Powers**: Approve/reject major military, financial, diplomatic, and appointment decisions\n- **Administration**: Álvaro de Luna handles day-to-day governance\n\n**Royal Council Meeting:**\n- **Date**: November 8, 1430 (6 months hence)\n- **Location**: Seville (Juan's choice - warmer, prestigious, near Granada frontier)\n- **Purpose**: Consultative gathering to discuss permanent governance structures\n- **Invitations**: ~18-20 members (royal family, military orders, church, great houses, city representatives)\n- **Format**: Discussion and counsel, not voting body - structure to be decided at the gathering itself\n\n**Timeline:**\n- May 13: Public ceremony in Valladolid to formalize regency council\n- Late May: Juan departs on pilgrimage\n- ~4 months: Pilgrimage/Rome journey\n- Late September/Early October: Juan returns\n- November 8: First Royal Council convenes in Seville\n\n**The Infantes' Perspective:**\nThey leave satisfied, even triumphant:\n- Gained real authority through regency council\n- Secured major council gathering they expect to dominate\n- Think they've outmaneuvered the young king\n- Believe they have legal path to control without rebellion\n- See Juan as manageable and grateful for guidance\n\n**Juan's Hidden Reality:**\n- Secured freedom to travel to Rome for papal backing\n- Gave real concessions to buy time and prevent immediate revolt\n- Plans to return with crusade bull that will override their political maneuvering\n- Hopes religious fervor and papal authority will trump their position\n- Betting 4 months of increased Infantes power against securing unassailable legitimacy\n\n### Chapter Conclusion\n\nThe meeting concludes with handshakes, warm words, and mutual satisfaction. Plans are made to formalize everything publicly in a week.\n\nBut as Juan and his company prepare to return to Valladolid, a cruel twist of fate awaits.\n\n**The dice have spoken.**\n\nDespite careful planning, despite the successful negotiation, despite giving the Infantes what they wanted - **something will go wrong during Juan's pilgrimage.**\n\n**The Infantes will revolt.**\n\n*How and why this catastrophe unfolds will be revealed in Chapter 2...*\n\n---\n\n## Key Characters Introduced\n\n**Juan II of Castile** - Age 18, anointed king beginning personal rule. Intelligent, strategic, pious. Learning to balance genuine devotion with political necessity. Willing to take enormous risks.\n\n**Álvaro de Luna** - Royal Constable, Juan's closest advisor. Brilliant, loyal, hated by nobles. From minor nobility but wields extraordinary power. Politically sophisticated but will be constrained by regency council.\n\n**Infante Juan de Aragón** - ~35, King of Navarra, elder Infante. Sophisticated political operator, patient, calculating. Sees long game.\n\n**Infante Enrique de Aragón** - Early 30s, warrior prince, more direct and dangerous. Less subtle than his brother but perhaps more genuinely threatening.\n\n**Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles** - Mid-30s, commander of royal guard. Minor knight from Extremadura, loyal to crown. Practical soldier, competent teacher, personally devoted to Juan.\n\n**Fray Hernando de Talavera** - ~32, Hieronymite monk. Humble background, extreme piety, morally rigorous. Chosen as royal confessor for Rome journey.\n\n**Juan de Daza** - ~40, commoner, treasury official. Careful observer, intelligent, tracking financial intelligence.\n\n**Diego Gómez de Sandoval (Count of Castro)** - 32, converso noble. Sharp, soldier and courtier, observing court factions.\n\n---\n\n## Themes Established\n\n- **Youth vs. Experience**: 18-year-old king facing seasoned political operators\n- **Legitimacy vs. Power**: Anointed authority vs. actual military/political control\n- **Deception as Statecraft**: Playing roles, managing perceptions, strategic weakness\n- **Faith and Politics**: Genuine piety intertwined with political calculation\n- **The Price of Time**: Trading short-term concessions for long-term gains\n- **Loyalty and Isolation**: Building support from nothing in a hostile environment\n\n---\n\n## Status at Chapter End\n\n**Juan's Position:**\n- Secured time and freedom for Rome journey\n- Made significant concessions to Infantes\n- Building advisory cabinet and intelligence network\n- Royal guard being properly equipped\n- Combat training begun\n- New confessor summoned\n\n**Immediate Future:**\n- May 13: Public ceremony formalizing regency council\n- Late May: Departure on \"pilgrimage\" (actually to Rome via Santiago)\n- 4 months away while Infantes exercise real power\n- Unknown: The revolt that will occur during absence\n\n**The Gamble:**\nEverything depends on securing that papal crusade bull. Return with papal authority and religious fervor, and the Infantes' political gains become irrelevant. Return empty-handed or delayed, and the kingdom may be lost.\n\n**The Dice Have Spoken:**\nDespite a \"likely to succeed\" probability assessment, fate has decreed otherwise. The Infantes will revolt during Juan's pilgrimage. The young king's careful planning, his convincing performance, his strategic concessions - none of it will prevent the coming storm.\n\n*Chapter 2 will reveal how disaster unfolds...*\n\n1. The opening situation and kingdom status\n2. Juan's decision to act and initial planning\n3. The failed guard assembly and equipment authorization\n4. Building the advisory cabinet\n5. The grand strategy (Rome, crusade, reforms)\n6. Understanding the Infantes and why they haven't moved yet\n7. Choosing Fray Hernando as confessor\n8. Week of preparation (combat training, rehearsals)\n9. The crucial meeting at Medina del Campo\n10. The detailed negotiation with the Infantes\n11. The agreements reached (regency council, royal council in Seville)\n12. The final outcome: despite everything, the dice decreed the Infantes will revolt\n\nThis is a good stopping point for the chapter, and sets up the next chapter where we'll discover how and why the revolt happens despite Juan's careful planning.\n\nThe document captures all the key events, decisions, characters, and themes established in this opening chapter.\n\nI've created a comprehensive summary of Chapter 1 in the artifact above.\n\nThis first chapter established Juan II's precarious position as a young king surrounded by powerful rivals, his ambitious plan to transform Castilian governance through papal backing and a crusade against Granada, and the high-stakes negotiation with the Infantes de Aragón.\n\nDespite a masterful performance convincing the Infantes that they had won, despite giving them real power through the regency council to prevent revolt, the dice have decreed otherwise.\n\nJuan will depart on his pilgrimage to Rome in late May 1430, leaving behind a regency council he hopes will keep the Infantes satisfied. But something will go wrong during those crucial months. The revolt will come.\n\nChapter 2 will reveal how this catastrophe unfolds - what triggers the Infantes to break their agreement, how Álvaro de Luna responds, what Juan discovers when news reaches him in distant lands, and whether the young king's gambit can be salvaged from disaster.\n\nThe game is afoot, and the dice have spoken their first cruel verdict."

This should be a success by default unless I roll for it, but the user hasn't proposed an action that needs a roll yet. They're just setting the scene for the meeting.\n\nI should:\n1. Describe the return journey from Medina del Campo\n2. Set the scene in the palace\n3. Describe the assembled cabinet members\n4. Have them introduce themselves or be introduced\n5. Wait for Juan to direct the meeting and explain why he's gathered them\n\nThe timeline: The meeting at Medina del Campo happened on May 6, 1430. It's now probably later that same day (if it's a 30-mile ride back) or the next day (May 7) depending on when they departed.\n\nLet me create an immersive scene that introduces all these characters properly.\n\nChapter 2: The Young King's Gambit (Continued)\n\nReturn to Valladolid - May 6, 1430, Evening\n\nThe ride back from Medina del Campo passes in contemplative silence. The spring sun hangs low over the Castilian plains as your party approaches Valladolid, the city's walls and towers catching the golden light. Captain Fernán rides close, occasionally glancing your way with an unreadable expression. Álvaro maintains his usual composed mask, though you catch him studying you several times with what might be concern, or perhaps admiration.\n\nAs you pass through the city gates, the guards snap to attention with noticeably better discipline than a week ago. The new equipment has already had an effect.\n\nRoyal Palace, Valladolid - Private Council Chamber\n\nThe chamber Álvaro has prepared is smaller than the grand audience halls—deliberately so. It's a working room: a long oak table, high-backed chairs, good light from tall windows overlooking the inner courtyard. Maps of Castile hang on the walls alongside a crucifix. Wine and water have been set out, along with writing materials.\n\nThey are all here.\n\nAs you enter, five men rise from their chairs. Some you've met briefly; others are new faces. All show varying degrees of curiosity, calculation, or concern about why the young king has summoned them.\n\nJuan de Daza (standing near the treasury documents):\nAge ~40, dressed in sober dark wool, the clothing of a prosperous merchant or official rather than a noble. Thinning hair, ink-stained fingers, sharp eyes that seem to catalogue everything. He carries himself with the careful dignity of a commoner who has risen through competence. You met him three days ago and assigned him to track financial flows in Valladolid.\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval, Count of Castro (by the window):\nAge 32, wearing well-made but understated noble attire. His converso heritage is known but rarely remarked upon—his family has been Christian for two generations and he's proven himself in both court and field. Dark beard, intelligent eyes, the bearing of someone comfortable in multiple worlds. You also met him three days ago, tasking him to observe court factions.\n\nLope de Barrientos (seated, studying a manuscript):\nAge ~38, Dominican robes marking him clearly. From Salamanca, he has the bearing of a scholar—slightly disheveled, but with penetrating eyes that suggest a mind always working. He looks up as you enter, and there's something reassuring in his direct gaze. No courtly polish, but clear intelligence.\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza (standing with perfect posture):\nAge ~28, perhaps the youngest in the room after yourself. From the powerful Mendoza family, but not the head of it. Fine clothing showing wealth and taste. There's poetry in how he moves, and his eyes observe everything with the attention of someone who will later put it into verse. Handsome, cultured, but you sense steel beneath the refinement.\n\nRodrigo Manrique (near the door):\nAge ~40, scarred face, practical frontier clothing under a well-worn cloak. A soldier through and through, from a respected military family. He looks slightly uncomfortable indoors, like a wolf brought into a sitting room. His hand rests habitually near where a sword would hang. Blunt, capable, dangerous.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stands to one side, having orchestrated this gathering but now deliberately remaining peripheral. Captain Fernán has taken a post by the door—close enough to hear, far enough to show this is not his meeting.\n\nAll eyes turn to you.\n\nThe room holds its breath, waiting to understand why these particular five men—so different in background and expertise—have been summoned by their young king on the very day he returned from meeting the Infantes de Aragón.\n\nWhat do you wish to say or do?"

          "text": "1. **Juan de Daza** - Commoner, treasury official. Would be honored but also pragmatic. He knows money doesn't grow on trees and the treasury is strained. He'd likely accept but might have practical concerns.\n\n2. **Diego Gómez de Sandoval** - Converso noble. This is a significant opportunity for someone whose family faces occasional discrimination. Would likely be very interested but cautious.\n\n3. **Lope de Barrientos** - Dominican scholar from Salamanca. Church networks. Would care more about influence and purpose than money. Might want to understand the role better.\n\n4. **Íñigo López de Mendoza** - Young Mendoza. This is politically significant - being in the king's inner circle. But his family is powerful and he needs to be careful about family politics.\n\n5. **Rodrigo Manrique** - Frontier soldier. Direct, blunt. Would want to know what he's actually supposed to do.\n\nThe promise of \"all the prestige you want and all the money you need\" is quite generous - perhaps too generous given the treasury situation. Some of these men would know that. It's also a bit naive - prestige doesn't come from promises, it comes from association with power and success.\n\nI should have them respond in character. Some acceptance, some questions, some concerns. They would need to understand what this actually means - what are their duties, what authority do they have, what risks are they taking by associating closely with the king?\n\nAlso, Juan just came back from meeting with the Infantes. These men might wonder what that meeting produced and how it affects their positions.\n\nThe First Cabinet Meeting\n\nYour words hang in the air. The five men exchange glances—some quick, others more lingering. There's a moment of collective assessment as each measures not just your offer, but each other.\n\nRodrigo Manrique breaks the silence first, his frontier bluntness cutting through the formality:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I'm a soldier. I know how to scout, how to read enemy movements, how to kill Moors and stay alive doing it.\" He shifts his weight, uncomfortable but direct. \"What you're describing—this 'cabinet'—what exactly do you want me to do? Attend meetings? Write reports? I'm not a courtier.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos sets down his manuscript, his scholar's mind already working:\n\n\"Your Majesty asks about how the clergy views your rule and your pilgrimage.\" He pauses, choosing words carefully. \"But prestige and money are not what move the Church. Purpose moves the Church. Authority moves the Church. Legitimacy moves the Church.\" His eyes are sharp. \"What authority would we wield in your name? Are we to observe and report? To advise in private? To act as your representatives in our respective... spheres?\"\n\nJuan de Daza clears his throat, ink-stained fingers drumming once on the table:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am honored beyond measure. Truly.\" His tone is respectful but carries the careful precision of a man who works with numbers. \"You say 'all the money you need'—the treasury currently runs at perhaps two million maravedís surplus in good years. If I may speak plainly... what resources are actually available for this enterprise? And...\" he hesitates, then continues, \"...what protection do we have? Men who advise kings sometimes become targets for those who would prefer the king receive... different counsel.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval steps forward from the window, his nobleman's grace evident:\n\n\"My family has served Castile for generations, Your Majesty. I accept, of course.\" He bows. \"But Count Manrique's question deserves answer. What specifically do you require of each of us? And—\" he glances at the others, \"—do the Infantes de Aragón know you are building this... cabinet?\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza speaks last, his cultured voice measured:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am young, and my uncle the Marquis de Santillana is the head of our house. I would be honored to serve you personally.\" He pauses delicately. \"But I must ask: is this service to you, or to your Constable?\" A meaningful glance toward Álvaro de Luna. \"My family will want to know where loyalties lie. No offense intended to Don Álvaro, who serves brilliantly, but... the nobility speaks much these days of who truly governs Castile.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna remains perfectly still by the wall, his face unreadable. Captain Fernán watches with a soldier's alertness, hand resting on his sword hilt.\n\nThe five men haven't refused—but they're asking the hard questions. What exactly is this position? What power comes with it? What danger? Whose creature will they be seen as—yours, or Álvaro's?\n\nAnd underlying it all: they can sense something has happened today. You've returned from meeting the Infantes, and now you're suddenly forming this inner council. They want to know what storm is coming, and whether standing close to you will provide shelter or make them targets.\n\nHow do you respond to their questions?"

Among all this clutter, I would like to have someone who I can actually trust and knows what he is talking about. That will be your task. \nSome of you also ask about your compensation. Let me assure you the crown is more than capable to pay you fairly for your services. But this is no money grab. The money you NEED, not want. \nAs for concerns for your safety; yes there will be danger. I will not hide you away from anyone, especially not the infantes.

Some will respect the directness, others might be concerned about the danger he's admitting, some will appreciate the clarity.\n\nLet me think about each character's likely response:\n- Rodrigo Manrique: Soldier, blunt. Will probably respect the straight talk and the practical role.\n- Juan de Daza: Careful, practical. Might be reassured by clarity but still concerned about specifics.\n- Lope de Barrientos: Scholar, thoughtful. Will want to understand the purpose more deeply.\n- Diego Gómez de Sandoval: Noble, sophisticated. Will appreciate the clear lines of loyalty.\n- Íñigo López de Mendoza: Young noble, poet. His Mendoza family question has been addressed but he'll need to consider family politics.\n\nThe challenge about \"if you fear death\" is quite pointed. It's essentially calling out anyone who hesitates as a coward. That's a strong move - could backfire or could earn respect.\n\nThe Cabinet Accepts\n\nThe room's temperature seems to shift with your words. You've laid down a challenge, drawn a clear line, and made the stakes explicit. No one can mistake this for a ceremonial position or a sinecure.\n\nRodrigo Manrique barks a short, harsh laugh—the first genuine sound of amusement in the room:\n\n\"Hah! Finally, someone who admits most nobles couldn't tell a Moorish cavalry charge from a donkey cart.\" He steps forward and drops to one knee with surprising grace for a scarred veteran. \"Your Majesty, I've faced death on the frontier for twenty years. I don't fear it—I just wanted to know the terms.\" He looks up, eyes hard and honest. \"You want someone who knows war and Moors and won't bullshit you? You have him. I accept.\"\n\nJuan de Daza relaxes slightly, the tension leaving his shoulders:\n\n\"'Need, not want.' That is... clarifying, Your Majesty.\" He bows, more at ease now. \"I apologize if I seemed grasping. In my world, one learns to establish terms clearly before beginning work.\" A slight smile. \"I accept. You will have accurate information about where the crown's money flows, and where it... doesn't arrive as intended.\" There's steel in that last phrase—he's already thinking about corruption.\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval moves forward with a nobleman's practiced grace, but there's real conviction in his voice:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you answer the question my family would ask. We serve the crown, not factions.\" He kneels smoothly. \"And you're right—if the Infantes see us as your men, that is what we are. Better to stand in clear daylight than skulk in shadows pretending neutrality. I accept, and I will observe and report on the court factions with clear eyes.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos rises from his seat, his Dominican robes rustling:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the Church teaches that wisdom comes from counsel, and that a king who seeks advice shows strength, not weakness.\" He bows his tonsured head. \"You ask about the clergy's view of your pilgrimage—I accept this charge. I will tell you what the bishops whisper, what the monasteries pray for, and whether Rome will see your devotion as genuine or political.\" He pauses. \"And I accept the danger. Dominican martyrs are numerous. We do not flinch.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza remains standing, and the room's attention focuses on him. He's the one with the most to lose—the Mendoza family is powerful, and being seen as the king's creature without family approval could be dangerous.\n\nHe takes a breath, and when he speaks, it's with the precision of a poet choosing exactly the right words:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am the youngest son of a powerful house. My elder brothers will lead our family. My cousins command armies. What am I to do with my life—write verses and attend banquets?\"\n\nHe steps forward, and there's something almost fierce in his cultured face:\n\n\"You offer me purpose. You offer me a role that matters. Yes, my uncle will be concerned. Yes, the Infantes will note this. Yes, there is danger.\" He kneels, and his voice drops but doesn't lose intensity. \"But you are my king, anointed by God and crowned by the Church. If I cannot serve you because powerful men might disapprove, then what kind of man am I? What kind of poetry would I write—verses about cowardice?\"\n\nHe looks up:\n\n\"I accept. I will observe the nobility as you command. And I will tell my uncle the Marquis that I serve Castile's rightful king, and that this service honors our house, not shames it.\"\n\nAll five men are now committed. Some kneel, some stand, but all have crossed the threshold.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna finally moves from his position by the wall. He doesn't smile—that would be unlike him—but something eases in his bearing:\n\n\"Your Majesty has chosen well,\" he says quietly. \"And now they know the truth: you are building something real.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán by the door nods once, approvingly. These are men who've committed despite the danger, not because they were promised safety.\n\nRodrigo Manrique, still kneeling, looks up with soldier's pragmatism:\n\n\"So, Your Majesty, what do you need to know first? About the frontier? The Granada situation? Or...\" he glances at the others, \"...whatever happened at Medina del Campo today that made you suddenly need advisors you can trust?\"\n\nThe question hangs in the air. They've accepted. They've committed. Now they want to know what they've gotten themselves into.\n\nDo you tell them about the Infantes meeting and the agreement you've reached? Do you reveal the pilgrimage plan? Or do you start with something else?"

This is a crucial area - the Granada frontier, the ongoing Reconquista, and the powerful military orders (Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara) are major factors in Castilian politics and military power.\n\nLet me have Rodrigo give him a realistic, blunt assessment of:\n1. The current state of the Granada frontier\n2. Military order politics and their relationship with the crown\n3. The actual military situation vs. what nobles at court might say\n\nThis should be informative and help Juan understand the real military/frontier situation, which will be important for his crusade plans.\n\nThe Frontier Reality\n\nRodrigo rises as you clasp his shoulder, and there's genuine respect in how he straightens. A king who touches a scarred soldier as an equal has already earned something.\n\nHe moves to the map of Castile on the wall, his scarred hand tracing the southern frontier:\n\n\"The frontier, Your Majesty, is not one thing. It's five hundred miles of border from the Portuguese frontier to Murcia, and every stretch has its own reality.\"\n\nHe taps different sections as he speaks, his voice taking on the cadence of a man who's lived what he describes:\n\nThe Frontier Situation\n\n\"The Western Frontier - Jaén, Úbeda, Baeza:\"\n\n\"This is where I've spent most of my years. Constant raiding both ways. The Moors come out of Granada in spring and summer—hit a village, take livestock, capture Christians for ransom or slavery. We do the same to them. It's... organized chaos. Both sides know the game.\"\n\nHe glances at you directly:\n\n\"Here's what the nobles in Valladolid won't tell you: most frontier lords have informal truces with their Moorish counterparts. They raid each other's peasants, yes, but there are rules. Messengers pass safely. Ransom negotiations happen. Sometimes they even warn each other about bigger threats.\"\n\n\"Why? Because total war would devastate everyone. The land would become worthless. So it's this... permanent low-intensity conflict. Enough to justify the frontier nobles' importance and income, not enough to actually threaten Granada's existence or cost the frontier lords everything.\"\n\n\"The Eastern Frontier - Murcia:\"\n\n\"Quieter. More trade actually. The Kingdom of Murcia has been Christian longer, the population is more mixed. Still Muslim villages paying tribute, Christian lords who've been there for generations. The raiding is less intense. Some might say it's more civilized.\" A slight sneer suggests what he thinks of \"civilized.\"\n\n\"The Central Frontier - Around Granada itself:\"\n\n\"The most fortified. The vega of Granada—their richest farmland—is heavily defended. Major fortresses on both sides. This is where any real campaign would have to focus. And Your Majesty, here's the hard truth: Granada's walls are strong. Their cavalry is excellent. And they're not divided like we are—Muhammad IX al-Aysar rules effectively right now.\"\n\nHe turns from the map:\n\n\"Any noble who tells you Granada could be conquered in one campaign season is either lying or ignorant. It would take years, enormous resources, and unified command. Things Castile hasn't had in living memory.\"\n\nThe Military Orders\n\nRodrigo's expression darkens slightly:\n\n\"The Orders—Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara—here's what you need to know:\"\n\n\"They should be your most reliable military force. Knight-monks, sworn to the Reconquista, theoretically loyal to the crown and the Pope. Wealthy—they own vast estates across Castile. They can field thousands of trained knights and men-at-arms.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing words carefully:\n\n\"But they've become political players. The Masters of the Orders aren't chosen by God or the Pope anymore—they're chosen by whoever has the most influence. And right now...\"\n\nJuan de Daza interjects quietly from his position:\n\n\"The Master of Santiago is Luis de Guzmán, isn't he? Allied with the Infantes' faction?\"\n\nRodrigo nods grimly:\n\n\"Exactly. And Calatrava's Master, García López de Padilla, plays all sides. Only Alcántara's Master, Gutierre de Sotomayor, might be genuinely neutral—and even that's because Alcántara is the smallest and poorest Order.\"\n\nHe faces you directly:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the Orders could be the spine of a crusade against Granada. But right now? They're noble factions in monastic robes. If you called for a crusade tomorrow, you'd have to ask yourself: would they follow your command, or would their Masters use it as leverage for political concessions?\"\n\nLope de Barrientos speaks up from his seat, his scholarly voice adding context:\n\n\"The Orders were founded for holy war, Your Majesty. Their original purpose was pure. But generations have passed, and they've become... complicated. Rich, politically entangled, focused on preserving their privileges as much as fighting Moors.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval adds from the window:\n\n\"And the frontier nobles depend on the existence of the Moorish threat. If Granada fell tomorrow, what would justify their special privileges? Their military exemptions? Their frontier subsidies?\" He lets that hang. \"Some frontier lords profit more from eternal conflict than they would from actual victory.\"\n\nRodrigo crosses his arms, summarizing bluntly:\n\n\"So here's your reality, Your Majesty: The frontier is active but controlled—more profitable as eternal border war than as conquest. The Military Orders are militarily powerful but politically compromised. The frontier nobles talk crusade at court but practice coexistence at home. And Granada is strong, unified, and not going anywhere unless someone commits to real war.\"\n\nHe leans forward:\n\n\"Now, if you're planning something—and I'm guessing you are, given this sudden cabinet—tell me: are you thinking of actual conquest? Or are you thinking of using the idea of crusade for something else?\"\n\nThe veteran's eyes are sharp. He's seen through to the political dimension.\n\nThe other cabinet members are watching your reaction carefully. They've just heard an assessment that contradicts much of what's said publicly at court. Rodrigo has essentially told you that the Reconquista has become performative politics rather than genuine holy war.\n\nHow do you respond? Do you share your crusade plans with this new cabinet?"

But the others might chime in too with their perspectives - Lope on religious/crusade aspects, Juan de Daza on financing, Diego on political feasibility, Íñigo on noble sentiment.\n\nThis should be a realistic assessment of what it would actually take to conquer Granada in 1430. Historically, Granada didn't fall until 1492, so this is 62 years early. It would be genuinely difficult but not impossible.\n\nKey factors:\n- Military: Need unified command, sustained campaign over multiple years, siege warfare capability\n- Financial: Enormous cost, need reliable funding\n- Political: Need noble unity or at least compliance, prevent backstabbing during campaign\n- Religious: Papal support would help immensely (crusade bull, indulgences, international participation)\n- Diplomatic: Prevent Aragon or others from interfering, possibly neutralize Morocco/North African support for Granada\n- Strategic: Need to take key fortresses sequentially, can't just march on Granada city\n\nRodrigo should give a sobering but not impossible assessment. He's a practical military man.\n\nThe Reality of Conquest\n\nRodrigo takes a breath, clearly organizing his thoughts. This is a question he's probably considered many times on cold frontier nights. He returns to the map, and the other cabinet members lean in—this is why they're here, to hear truth instead of courtly platitudes.\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the right question. Not should we conquer Granada, but how.\" He traces the frontier line. \"I've spent twenty years fighting Moors. Here's what it would actually take.\"\n\nMilitary Requirements\n\n\"First: Unified Command\"\n\n\"This is the biggest problem. Every frontier noble thinks he's a military genius. Every Master of the Military Orders wants glory. Everyone wants to command their own forces their own way.\" His finger stabs the map emphatically. \"Granada survives because we are divided and they are united.\"\n\n\"You'd need one supreme commander—not a council of nobles arguing while the Moors fortify. Someone with absolute authority over all forces, answerable only to you. And Your Majesty...\" he looks at you directly, \"...the nobles would hate this. They'd see it as tyranny.\"\n\n\"Second: A Real Army\"\n\n\"Not feudal levies that go home for harvest. Not knights who show up for forty days and leave. A professional force that can campaign for years if needed.\"\n\nJuan de Daza interjects, his treasurer's mind already calculating:\n\n\"That means paying soldiers. Continuously. For years. Your Majesty, our current annual revenue barely covers peacetime expenses...\"\n\nRodrigo nods grimly:\n\n\"He's right. You'd need money. Lots of it. But more on that later.\"\n\nHe continues:\n\n\"Realistically, you'd need fifteen to twenty thousand men minimum. Infantry, cavalry, siege engineers, supply train. And they'd need to be sustained—fed, paid, equipped, replaced when they die. The Moors will make us bleed for every fortress.\"\n\n\"Third: Siege Capability\"\n\n\"Granada isn't one city. It's dozens of fortresses protecting the capital. Each one would need to be besieged and taken.\" He points to locations on the map:\n\n\"Málaga. Almería. Baza. Guadix. Ronda. Each is heavily fortified. Each could hold out for months. You'd need siege engines, engineers who know their craft, patience, and willingness to accept losses.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos adds quietly:\n\n\"The Moorish fortifications are formidable. They've learned from centuries of war. This would not be like raiding—this would be systematic reduction of prepared defenses.\"\n\nStrategic Approach\n\nRodrigo traces a path on the map:\n\n\"If I were planning this—truly planning it, not court fantasy—here's what I'd do:\"\n\n\"Phase One: Secure the Western Approaches (1-2 years)\"\n\n\"Start here.\" He points to the western frontier. \"Take the fortresses west of Granada—Alhama, Zahara, Ronda. These cut Granada off from potential Moroccan reinforcement across the strait. And they're further from Granada's main strength.\"\n\n\"This also tests your army. Builds experience. Shows the nobles you're serious. And most importantly—early victories bring in more support and funding.\"\n\n\"Phase Two: Strangle the Economy (2-3 years)\"\n\n\"Granada is rich because of the vega—the farmland around the capital. You systematically take or destroy it. Cut their food supply. Raid their trade routes. Make every caravan from North Africa run a gauntlet.\"\n\n\"This is brutal, unglamorous work. Burning crops, killing peasants or driving them into the city. The nobles won't like it—no glory in burning wheat fields. But it's how you win.\"\n\n\"Phase Three: Eastern Fortresses (2-3 years)\"\n\n\"While Granada starves, take Baza, Guadix, Almería. Surround them. At this point, if you've done everything right, Granada city is isolated, weakened, and running out of food.\"\n\n\"Phase Four: The Final Siege (1-2 years)\"\n\n\"Only then do you besiege Granada itself. And even then, it could take a year or more. Their walls are magnificent. They'll fight street by street.\"\n\nHe steps back from the map:\n\n\"Total timeline? Eight to ten years minimum. More likely twelve to fifteen if things go badly—and things always go badly in war.\"\n\nThe Hard Requirements\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval speaks up, his nobleman's perspective adding political reality:\n\n\"Rodrigo's timeline assumes noble cooperation for a decade. Your Majesty, most nobles can barely cooperate for a single campaign season. After one or two years, they'd start demanding rewards, honors, arguing over spoils, going home...\"\n\nJuan de Daza adds the financial dimension:\n\n\"Your Majesty, current annual revenue is roughly thirty million maravedís. A campaign of this scale would cost...\" he calculates mentally, \"...twenty to thirty million per year just for the army, not counting fortifications, equipment losses, contingencies. You'd need to double royal revenue and sustain it for a decade.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos provides the religious angle:\n\n\"A Papal crusade bull would help immensely. It would provide religious legitimacy, allow you to levy special crusade taxes, attract foreign knights seeking indulgences. Without papal backing, this is just another border war. With it, it becomes a holy cause that can inspire and finance itself.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza adds thoughtfully:\n\n\"And the Infantes de Aragón would need to either support this crusade or be neutralized. If they oppose it, they can paralyze recruitment, block funding, and ensure failure. If they support it...\" he pauses, \"...they'll demand command positions and credit for victories.\"\n\nRodrigo's Assessment\n\nThe veteran crosses his arms and delivers his conclusion:\n\n\"Your Majesty, here's the truth: Granada can be conquered. But it requires things Castile hasn't had in generations:\n\nOne: Unified political will for a decade or more\nTwo: Sustained, reliable funding \nThree: Professional military organization under single command\nFour: Willingness to prosecute total war, not chivalric raiding\nFive: Either neutralization or cooperation of the great nobles\n\n\"Without all five? You'll have another expensive, bloody failure like so many before. A few fortresses taken, lots of glory claimed, Granada still standing, treasury empty, and nobles more fractious than ever.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly:\n\n\"Can it be done? Yes. Will it be easy? Absolutely not. Should you try? That depends on whether you can create the political and financial conditions to sustain it. Otherwise, you're just getting good men killed for nothing.\"\n\nThe room is silent. You've asked for truth, and you've received it. Conquering Granada is possible but would require transforming Castile's entire military, financial, and political structure—exactly the kind of transformation the great nobles would resist.\n\nJuan de Daza ventures carefully:\n\n\"Your Majesty, if I may... the meeting with the Infantes today. Does it relate to these thoughts about Granada? Are you seeking their cooperation for a crusade? Or...\" he hesitates, \"...is the crusade a means to another end?\"\n\nThe cabinet is beginning to see the larger picture. They're wondering what you're really planning.\n\nHow do you respond? Do you reveal your Rome plan and the agreement with the Infantes? Do you share the full strategy, or keep some cards close?"

There is no crusade bull currently in effect for Iberia, nor any signals from Rome that Pope Martin V is considering one.\"\n\nHe folds his hands, settling into explanation mode:\n\n\"The current Pope—Martin V, elected in 1417 after the Council of Constance finally ended the Great Schism—has been focused primarily on rebuilding papal authority after forty years of competing popes. His priorities have been Italian politics, restoring Rome itself, and reestablishing the Church's temporal power.\"\n\nJuan de Daza adds a practical observation:\n\n\"Rome also remembers that Iberian crusade bulls have been... inconsistently successful. The money raised sometimes stays in Castile rather than flowing to Rome. Past bulls were issued, taxes collected, and then the campaigns fizzled.\"\n\nLope nods:\n\n\"True. The last significant crusade bull for Granada was decades ago under Benedict XIII—but he was the Avignon antipope during the Schism, so his bulls are of questionable validity anyway. Martin V has issued no new one.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly:\n\n\"If Your Majesty were to seek such a bull, you would need to petition Rome directly. Send an embassy, or...\" he pauses thoughtfully, \"...in rare cases, monarchs have traveled personally to demonstrate their sincerity. But such a bull is not simply granted. The Pope would want assurances: that you're serious, that funds raised would be properly used, that you have the means to actually prosecute a campaign.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval speaks up from his position by the window:\n\n\"Your Majesty, if I may observe—you ask detailed questions about how to conquer Granada, then clarify you have no intention of crusade.\" A slight smile. \"This is either royal curiosity, or you're testing us to see what we know before revealing your true thoughts.\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique grunts:\n\n\"Or he's being smart. A king who announces plans before he's ready is a king who gives his enemies time to prepare.\" The veteran looks at you with approval. \"I don't need to know your intentions, Your Majesty. I need to give you accurate information so whatever you do decide is based on reality, not fantasy.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza adds with a poet's careful phrasing:\n\n\"And perhaps Your Majesty wishes to understand the full landscape before committing to any course. Wise kings consider many options before choosing one.\" He glances at the others. \"We are here to provide counsel, not to demand confidence before it's earned.\"\n\nJuan de Daza, ever the practical administrator, ventures:\n\n\"Your Majesty, if I may redirect slightly—you mentioned wanting to understand constraints and options. Beyond Granada and crusades, what other information would be valuable? The treasury situation? Noble factions? Trade and taxation? The more we understand what you need to know, the better we can serve.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos adds:\n\n\"Or Church matters beyond crusades? The state of the dioceses, the bishops' loyalties, relations with the religious orders? These things affect royal authority as much as military matters.\"\n\nThey're probing gently, trying to understand what you really need without demanding you reveal plans you're not ready to share. They've accepted that you're playing a careful game—they just want to know how to be useful within it.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna, who has been silent throughout, finally speaks from his position by the wall:\n\n\"Your Majesty demonstrates wisdom. A king who asks 'how would this work' before committing to action is rarer than one might hope.\" There's the slightest emphasis on those words—he's reinforcing your caution while subtly telling the cabinet that yes, there are plans, but they'll be revealed when appropriate.\n\nCaptain Fernán by the door remains watchful, but you catch the briefest nod of approval. You're handling this well.\n\nThe cabinet waits. You've established that you gather information carefully before acting. You've tested their knowledge about Rome and crusades without revealing your intentions. You've learned that there's no current papal crusade, but that such a thing could be sought—with effort.\n\nWhat other information do you want from your new cabinet?

Diego Gómez de Sandoval (the nobleman) and possibly Íñigo López de Mendoza would have good insight into royal family relations. Lope de Barrientos might know about diplomatic history.\n\nThe key tension here is that Juan just made an agreement with the Infantes de Aragón, who are literally from the Aragonese royal family. An alliance with Aragon proper could either strengthen his position or complicate things depending on how Alfonso V views his brothers' activities in Castile.\n\nForeign Relations - Aragon and Portugal\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval steps forward, this being clearly his domain as a nobleman familiar with royal lineages and diplomacy:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the situation with Aragon is... complicated by the very men you met today.\"\n\nHe moves to the map, pointing to the eastern kingdoms:\n\nThe Aragon Situation\n\n\"King Alfonso V of Aragon—Alfonso the Magnanimous, they're calling him—is your cousin. He's about thirty-four years old, ambitious, and currently obsessed with Italian affairs. He wants Naples, dreams of Mediterranean empire, spends more time thinking about Italy than Iberia.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza adds his knowledge:\n\n\"And the Infantes de Aragón—Juan and Enrique—are King Alfonso's younger brothers. Juan is actually King of Navarre through marriage. They have significant estates here in Castile through inheritance from their mother, Queen Eleanor.\"\n\nDiego continues:\n\n\"Here's the fundamental problem, Your Majesty: King Alfonso has not reined in his brothers. Whether he can't or won't is debated. Some say he's content to let them build power in Castile while he focuses on Italy. Others say he's lost control of them entirely.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing words carefully:\n\n\"An alliance with Aragon? Possible in theory. You share blood. But what would it mean in practice? Would Alfonso order his brothers to stop interfering in Castile? Would he even want to? Or would 'alliance' simply mean formalizing Aragonese influence here?\"\n\nLope de Barrientos interjects with historical context:\n\n\"The Crown of Aragon and Castile have been rivals for centuries, Your Majesty. Sometimes allies against common enemies, yes, but fundamentally competing for dominance in Iberia. Any alliance would need to clearly define what Aragon gains and what Castile doesn't lose.\"\n\nDiego nods:\n\n\"Marriage alliance is the traditional route. You're eighteen and unmarried—Alfonso has sisters, though I'd need to check their current status. Or there might be suitable Aragonese noblewomen. But...\" he hesitates.\n\n\"Your Majesty, any marriage alliance negotiated now, while the Infantes are actively maneuvering in Castile, would be negotiated from weakness. Alfonso would demand concessions. The Infantes would demand guarantees for their position here. You'd be formalizing their power rather than limiting it.\"\n\nThe Portugal Situation\n\nDiego shifts his attention westward on the map:\n\n\"Portugal is different. King João I is elderly now—seventy-three years old, nearing the end of a very long and successful reign. He's focused on his sons' expeditions—they're exploring down the African coast, taking Ceuta, building an ocean-going empire.\"\n\n\"Relations with Castile are... correct. Not warm, but not hostile. The wars of succession from the 1380s are old history now. There's trade, there's peace, but there's also Portuguese wariness of Castilian power.\"\n\nJuan de Daza adds a merchant's perspective:\n\n\"Portugal trades extensively with Flanders, England, and increasingly with Africa. They're becoming wealthy from this trade. An alliance might open commercial opportunities—or might threaten their independence, which they guard jealously.\"\n\nDiego continues:\n\n\"Marriage alliance is possible here too. King João has several children and grandchildren. His son Duarte will inherit soon—he has daughters who might be suitable. Or there are Portuguese noblewomen.\"\n\nHe pauses thoughtfully:\n\n\"Portugal has an advantage as an ally: they're outside Castile's internal politics. An alliance with Portugal doesn't immediately strengthen any particular Castilian faction. It's external support without domestic complications.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza adds:\n\n\"Though the Portuguese are proud. They won their independence from Castile and won't forget it. Any alliance would need to respect their sovereignty absolutely. They'd rather stay neutral than become subordinate.\"\n\nStrategic Assessment\n\nRodrigo Manrique, the soldier, offers his practical view:\n\n\"Your Majesty, from a military standpoint: Aragon shares a long border with us, has significant military power, and their nobles hold lands in both kingdoms. They're entangled whether we like it or not. Portugal shares a shorter border, has a smaller but professional military, and stays out of our internal mess.\"\n\n\"If you're thinking about Granada: Aragon has Mediterranean interests and Italian distractions. They're not going to commit seriously to Reconquista—they're looking east, not south. Portugal is exploring Africa and might actually be interested in cooperative campaigning against Moorish territories, though they'd want separate commands and clear division of spoils.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna speaks from the wall, his voice quiet but carrying weight:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the question is not just alliance, but timing. Any negotiation with Aragon right now happens in the shadow of your agreement with the Infantes. Any approach to Portugal will be interpreted through the lens of Castilian internal politics—are you seeking external support because you're weak domestically?\"\n\nHe lets that hang in the air.\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval summarizes:\n\n\"To answer your question directly, Your Majesty:\n\nAragon: Alliance is possible but complicated by the Infantes' position. King Alfonso might be receptive, but what would he demand? And would alliance help you control his brothers, or give them more legitimacy? This requires careful diplomacy and probably negotiation from a position of greater strength than you currently hold.\n\nPortugal: Alliance is possible and cleaner—fewer domestic complications. They're cautious but rational. A marriage alliance could be negotiated relatively straightforwardly if you offer respect and mutual benefit. They won't save you from internal threats, but they won't make them worse either.\n\nNeither alliance would solve your immediate problems with the nobility. Both would require concessions. And both would be interpreted differently depending on when and how you pursue them.\"\n\nThe cabinet watches your reaction. You've asked about foreign alliances, and they've given you the uncomfortable truth: you're negotiating from weakness right now, and foreign powers know it.\n\nJuan de Daza ventures carefully:\n\n\"Your Majesty, if I may observe—foreign alliances are typically most valuable when pursued from strength, not necessity. They amplify power; they rarely create it from nothing. The question might be: what would make Castile strong enough that Aragon or Portugal seek alliance with us, rather than us seeking it from them?\"\n\nA subtle but important reframing.\n\nWhat other questions do you have for your cabinet? Or do you wish to reveal more about your plans?"

But Alfonso V's wife wouldn't work (already married). Alfonso's sisters might exist but wouldn't put Juan in the succession unless their children inherited. The most realistic path would be if somehow Juan's children could inherit, but that would require Alfonso V and all his brothers to die without heirs - unlikely but theoretically possible.\n\n**Portugal:** Similar situation - he'd need to marry into the line of succession, but Duarte has male heirs, so it's very unlikely.\n\nThe cabinet members would know this and would give realistic assessments. Diego would be the expert here.\n\nDynastic Possibilities\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval pauses, clearly considering the question's implications. The other cabinet members lean in slightly—this is a bold question that reveals strategic ambition.\n\n\"Your Majesty, that is... a far-reaching question.\" Diego moves back to the map, his mind clearly working through lineages. \"Let me address each crown separately.\"\n\nThe Crown of Aragon\n\n\"King Alfonso V is thirty-four and married to Maria of Castile—your own sister, Your Majesty, though the marriage is... not fruitful so far. No children after several years.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza adds quietly:\n\n\"There are whispers at court that the marriage is unconsummated or at least unsuccessful. Alfonso spends most of his time in Italy. The Queen remains in Aragon.\"\n\nDiego continues:\n\n\"If Alfonso were to die without legitimate heirs, the succession would pass to his brothers—the Infantes Juan and Enrique. Juan is already King of Navarre through his marriage to Blanca. Enrique is unmarried.\"\n\nHe pauses, calculating:\n\n\"For you to inherit Aragon through marriage... you would need to marry someone in the direct line of succession. Alfonso has sisters, but they're not in the direct line—their children wouldn't inherit ahead of Alfonso's brothers unless all the brothers died without heirs.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos interjects with canonical knowledge:\n\n\"The Church would need to approve any such marriage carefully. Marrying into the Aragonese royal family given your existing blood ties would require dispensations for consanguinity. Possible, but Rome would scrutinize it.\"\n\nDiego delivers the assessment:\n\n\"Realistically, Your Majesty? Inheriting Aragon through marriage is extremely unlikely. You'd need Alfonso and all his brothers to die without legitimate male heirs, and you or your sons to have married into the line. Possible in theory over generations, but not a practical short-term strategy.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds carefully:\n\n\"Though if you had sons who married Aragonese princesses, and if the Aragonese succession failed... your grandchildren might unite the crowns. Dynastic politics works over generations, not years.\"\n\nThe Crown of Portugal\n\n\"King João I is seventy-three. His heir, Duarte, is in his late thirties and already has children—including sons. The Portuguese succession is secure for at least two generations.\"\n\nDiego shakes his head:\n\n\"Inheriting Portugal through marriage is even less likely than Aragon, Your Majesty. Duarte has legitimate male heirs. You'd need catastrophic dynastic failure—plague, warfare, multiple deaths—for the succession to become vulnerable.\"\n\n\"You could marry a Portuguese princess, certainly. That would create alliance and potential future claims for your children if Portuguese succession failed. But expecting to personally inherit Portugal? No, that's not realistic.\"\n\nThe Broader Picture\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza speaks up, his poet's mind seeing patterns:\n\n\"Your Majesty, if I may... personal unions of crowns are generational projects. Ferdinand and Isabella might unite Castile and Aragon someday if the right marriages and successions align. But it takes time, patience, and usually requires multiple dynastic accidents.\"\n\nJuan de Daza, the practical administrator:\n\n\"And Your Majesty, even if you could inherit another crown, consider the complications. Aragon has its own Cortes, its own laws, its own nobility. Portugal fiercely guards its independence. A personal union might give you titles, but could you actually govern multiple kingdoms effectively?\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique adds bluntly:\n\n\"You can barely control the nobles here in Castile, Your Majesty—no offense meant. Adding Aragonese or Portuguese nobility to manage? That's not strength, that's asking for rebellions in multiple kingdoms.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna finally speaks, his voice measured:\n\n\"Your Majesty asks the right questions, but perhaps for the wrong reasons. Dynastic inheritance is about legacy and future generations. It's not a solution to present challenges.\"\n\nHe steps forward slightly:\n\n\"If you want to strengthen Castile's position relative to Aragon or Portugal, the path is not through inheriting their crowns. It's through making Castile strong enough that they must respect us, alliance or no alliance.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval summarizes:\n\n\"To answer directly, Your Majesty:\n\nAragon: Theoretically possible if catastrophic succession failure occurs, but highly unlikely in your lifetime. A marriage alliance might position your descendants for eventual union, but that's generations away.\n\nPortugal: Even more unlikely. Their succession is secure. Marriage creates alliance, not inheritance prospects.\n\nPractical conclusion: Dynastic marriages are valuable for alliances, dowries, and long-term positioning. But if you're thinking about inheriting foreign crowns as a solution to current problems... that's not realistic strategy.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds carefully:\n\n\"Unless, Your Majesty, you're thinking much longer term? Building a legacy over decades? In which case, yes—the right marriages now could position your children or grandchildren to unite Iberian crowns eventually.\"\n\nThe cabinet is watching you carefully. You've asked about inheritance, which suggests either very long-term thinking or perhaps misunderstanding how dynastic politics works. They're trying to determine which.\n\nLope de Barrientos ventures:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the greatest kings think in generations. But they also address the challenges of today. Perhaps the question is: what marriages or alliances serve both immediate stability and long-term dynastic prospects?\"\n\nHow do you respond? Are you thinking long-term dynasty building, or were you hoping for a quicker solution?"

This is an important detail I should provide. Let me think about the historical context.\n\nHistorically, Juan II of Aragon (the Infante Juan in our story) did have children, including Ferdinand II who would later marry Isabella and unite the crowns. But we're in 1430, so I need to figure out what the situation would be at this time.\n\nJuan married Blanca of Navarre in 1420, so by 1430 they could have children. Historically, their son Carlos (Charles, Prince of Viana) was born in 1421, so he'd be about 9 years old in 1430. They had other children too.\n\nSo yes, Infante Juan would have children by 1430, which means the Aragonese succession through him is actually reasonably secure. This is an important detail that affects Juan II of Castile's strategic calculations.\n\nLet me have Diego provide this information clearly.\n\nThe Aragonese Succession\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval nods, understanding your focus:\n\n\"Exactly right, Your Majesty. Let me clarify the complete picture.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\"Infante Juan de Aragón—the elder of the two brothers you met today—is King of Navarre through his marriage to Blanca of Navarre. They married in 1420, so ten years ago.\"\n\nHe pauses significantly:\n\n\"And yes, they have children. A son, Carlos—he'd be about nine years old now. Born in 1421. There may be other children as well; I'd need to confirm the complete details, but the crucial point is: Infante Juan has a legitimate male heir.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza adds:\n\n\"Young Carlos is being raised in Navarre. He's the Prince of Viana—that's his title as heir to Navarre. Reportedly a serious, studious boy.\"\n\nDiego continues:\n\n\"So the Aragonese succession, if Alfonso dies without heirs, would be:\n\nFirst: Infante Juan becomes King of Aragon (while remaining King of Navarre)\nSecond: Upon Juan's death, his son Carlos inherits\nThird: Only if both Juan's and Enrique's lines fail completely would the succession become uncertain\"\n\nHe looks at you directly:\n\n\"Your Majesty, this means the Aragonese succession is actually quite secure. Alfonso has two younger brothers. One of those brothers already has a son. For you to inherit Aragon through marriage, you would need:\n\nAlfonso to die without heirs\n\nJuan to die without legitimate heirs (but he already has Carlos)\n\nEnrique to die without heirs\n\nCarlos to die without heirs\n\nAnd you'd need to have married into the line somehow\n\nThat's... a lot of deaths, Your Majesty. And frankly, some would look suspicious.\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique grunts:\n\n\"And even if all those men dropped dead tomorrow—which they won't—Aragon would likely choose one of their own nobles over a Castilian king. They're proud. They'd find some cousin with Aragonese blood rather than accept Castilian rule.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos adds soberly:\n\n\"There's also the matter that the Church frowns upon... convenient dynastic deaths. If heirs started dying suspiciously and you benefited, Rome would investigate. Poisoning rumors destroyed Pope Alexander VI's reputation. You don't want that shadow over your reign.\"\n\nJuan de Daza speaks practically:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I think what you're really asking is: 'Can I use the Aragonese succession as leverage?' And the answer is... perhaps, but not through inheritance.\"\n\nHe leans forward:\n\n\"Here's a different angle: Infante Juan has a son who will inherit Navarre and potentially Aragon. That boy is nine years old. In ten years, he'll be making his own alliances and marriage decisions. Your relationship with the Infantes now might position you to influence that boy's future choices.\"\n\nDiego nods thoughtfully:\n\n\"Or consider this: you have no heir yet, Your Majesty. Neither does Alfonso. You're both young. If you married and had children, and Alfonso remained childless, there might be future discussions about uniting the crowns through your children's generation—with Aragonese consent, not through conquest or forced inheritance.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna speaks from his position, his voice carrying a warning:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I must counsel caution in this line of thinking. The Infantes are here, in Castile, now, with armies and noble support. Speculating about inheriting their potential future kingdoms while they're actively maneuvering against you is... dangerous.\"\n\nHe pauses:\n\n\"They would view any such discussion as proof you see them as obstacles to be removed rather than relatives to work with. If word spread that you were calculating their deaths and succession rights... well, that's how civil wars start.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán shifts by the door, his soldier's instinct clearly agreeing with Álvaro's warning.\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval concludes:\n\n\"To summarize, Your Majesty:\n\nThe Reality: Aragonese succession is secure through Infante Juan and his son Carlos. You cannot realistically expect to inherit Aragon.\n\nThe Opportunity: Long-term dynastic positioning—your children might marry into Aragonese or Portuguese lines, creating future union possibilities.\n\nThe Danger: If you're seen as viewing the Infantes' deaths as beneficial to you, that poisons all relations and might even make them move against you preemptively.\n\nThe Recommendation: Think generationally about dynasty, but focus practically on securing your own throne first.\"\n\nHe looks at you carefully:\n\n\"Your Majesty, may I ask what prompted this line of inquiry? Are you thinking about marriage alliances generally, or is there a specific strategic concern we should address?\"\n\nThe cabinet is clearly trying to understand your thinking.

King João I's son Duarte has daughters who will be of marriageable age soon, or there are other Portuguese noblewomen.\"\n\nAdvantages:\n\n\"Clean\" alliance without domestic complications\n\nWealthy trading partner\n\nPotential cooperation on African/Moorish matters\n\nThe Portuguese royal house is respected and legitimate\n\nDoesn't strengthen any Castilian faction\n\nDisadvantages:\n\nPortugal is small—doesn't dramatically shift power balance\n\nPortuguese are fiercely independent; won't intervene in Castilian politics\n\nLimited military support for your domestic challenges\n\nDiego continues: \"This would be a safe choice. Respectable, uncontroversial, diplomatically sound. But it doesn't solve immediate problems.\"\n\n\"Aragonese Alliance\"\n\n\"King Alfonso's sisters or other Aragonese noblewomen. Given that your own sister Maria is married to Alfonso, another Aragonese connection might strengthen ties.\"\n\nAdvantages:\n\nBlood ties formalized\n\nPotential to influence Aragonese policy\n\nMight moderate the Infantes' behavior if you're family in both directions\n\nDisadvantages:\nJuan de Daza interjects: \"Your Majesty, forgive my bluntness, but marrying into the Aragonese royal family right now would be seen as capitulation to the Infantes. Every noble in Castile would interpret it as you becoming their creature.\"\n\nDiego nods reluctantly: \"He's right. The timing is terrible. An Aragonese marriage would need to happen from a position of strength, not during their current maneuvering.\"\n\n\"Navarrese Alliance\"\n\n\"Navarre is small but strategic, sitting between Castile, Aragon, and France. Though currently ruled by Infante Juan through marriage...\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique interrupts: \"That's a non-starter. Juan is King of Navarre. Marrying into Navarre now just tangles you further with the Infantes.\"\n\nForeign Options\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza speaks up, his cosmopolitan knowledge showing:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you could look beyond Iberia. European royal houses are always interested in Spanish alliances.\"\n\n\"French Alliance\"\n\n\"King Charles VII of France is fighting the English in the Hundred Years' War. He has daughters, relatives, noble houses.\"\n\nAdvantages:\n\nFrance is powerful\n\nBrings prestige and potential military support\n\nTraditional Castilian-French friendship against England\n\nFrench culture is prestigious at court\n\nDisadvantages:\nLope de Barrientos adds: \"France is currently losing to England—or was until recently with this peasant girl Joan leading their armies. Their situation is unstable. Also, a French marriage might alarm Aragon, which has Italian and Mediterranean interests that conflict with France.\"\n\nDiego: \"And French princesses come with French advisors, French factions, French influence at your court. Are you prepared for that?\"\n\n\"English Alliance\"\n\n\"King Henry VI of England—though he's only eight years old. But there are English noble houses, or waiting until a suitable match emerges.\"\n\nAdvantages:\n\nEngland is wealthy from wool trade\n\nMilitary prowess (currently winning in France)\n\nPrestigious alliance\n\nDisadvantages:\nJuan de Daza: \"England is far away and focused on France. They won't help with Granada or domestic politics. And wool trade might benefit England more than Castile.\"\n\nRodrigo: \"And English nobles would expect military adventures. They'd push for wars that benefit England, not Castile.\"\n\n\"Italian Alliance\"\n\n\"A princess from Milan, Florence, Venice, or Naples. King Alfonso of Aragon wants Naples—there are connections there.\"\n\nAdvantages:\n\nWealthy Italian city-states\n\nBanking connections (useful for financing campaigns)\n\nCultural prestige\n\nMediterranean trade benefits\n\nDisadvantages:\nDiego: \"Italian politics are byzantine—forgive the term. You'd be buying into feuds between city-states, papal politics, and Alfonso's ambitions. Complex and potentially costly.\"\n\n\"German/Imperial Alliance\"\n\n\"The Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund is elderly, but there are German princesses, Habsburg connections, other imperial houses.\"\n\nAdvantages:\n\nImperial prestige\n\nPotential papal influence (Emperor has sway in Rome)\n\nGerman wealth and resources\n\nDisadvantages:\nLope: \"The Empire is fractured—hundreds of princes and free cities, all squabbling. An Imperial alliance means little in practice. And German nobles would be completely lost in Castilian politics.\"\n\nDomestic Considerations\n\nJuan de Daza raises his hand:\n\n\"Your Majesty, may I address something everyone is dancing around?\" He waits for your nod. \"Any marriage you make will be interpreted domestically through the lens of your struggle with the nobility.\"\n\n\"If you marry foreign, the Castilian nobles will complain you're bringing in outsiders and foreign influence. They'll demand that her household be staffed by Castilians—meaning their clients and spies.\"\n\n\"If you marry Castilian nobility—say, a daughter from Mendoza, Velasco, or another great house—you dramatically strengthen that family and alarm all the others. The Infantes would see it as choosing sides.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval adds:\n\n\"The traditional solution is to marry foreign but not too foreign. Close enough to be relevant, far enough to not bring overwhelming external influence. Portugal fits this perfectly—Iberian, Catholic, understood by Castilian nobles, but Portuguese enough to be neutral in our politics.\"\n\nPersonal Considerations\n\nLope de Barrientos speaks gently:\n\n\"Your Majesty, there's also the matter of... personal compatibility. You will have to live with this woman, produce heirs with her, perhaps even trust her. A political marriage need not be loveless, but it should at least not be miserable.\"\n\nHe continues carefully:\n\n\"A young bride can be educated to Castilian ways and attached to you personally. An older, politically experienced princess might have her own agenda. Youth suggests fertility for heirs but also malleability. Age suggests immediate diplomatic maturity but potential conflict.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza adds with a poet's sensibility:\n\n\"And Your Majesty, you are young—only eighteen. You have time. Rushing into marriage now, while facing political challenges, means your bride and her family become immediate targets or assets in ongoing struggles. Waiting even a year or two until your position strengthens might allow you to negotiate from better terms.\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna's Assessment\n\nYour Constable finally speaks from his position:\n\n\"Your Majesty, marriage is the second most important decision you'll make—after how you handle the nobility. The two are connected.\"\n\n\"My counsel: don't marry until you've secured your position domestically. Every potential bride's family will assess your strength before agreeing to terms. Marry from weakness, and you'll pay dearly in concessions—her family will demand positions, influence, guarantees.\"\n\n\"But marry from strength—after you've established yourself—and you can negotiate as an equal. Your bride brings alliance and resources, but you're not dependent on them.\"\n\nHe pauses:\n\n\"That said, if you see a specific strategic opportunity—a marriage that actively strengthens your position against the Infantes—that might be worth considering sooner.\"\n\nSummary\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval provides the conclusion:\n\n\"Your Majesty, my recommendation based on current circumstances:\n\nBest immediate option: Portuguese princess—safe, respectable, neutral in domestic politics, creates useful alliance without complications.\n\nBest long-term option: Wait 1-2 years until your position strengthens, then reassess. French, English, or even Aragonese options become more attractive when negotiating from strength.\n\nAvoid now: Aragonese (looks like capitulation to Infantes), Castilian nobility (creates immediate factional problems), anything too exotic that brings unpredictable complications.\n\nWildcard: If a truly exceptional opportunity emerges—a princess who brings massive dowry, crucial alliance, and political advantage—consider it. But don't force it.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly:\n\n\"The honest answer, Your Majesty? You don't need to marry right now. You need to secure your throne. Marriage can wait six months, a year, even two years. You're eighteen—you have time. Use it wisely.\"\n\nThe cabinet waits for your reaction. They've laid out options but are essentially counseling patience—secure your position first, then marry from strength.\n\nDo you have thoughts on their assessment? Or other questions for your cabinet?"

They've just been recruited, and now they're learning their king is about to leave on pilgrimage with a regency council (presumably including the Infantes) in place. This would be alarming to them.\n\nI should show their reactions - surprise, concern, questions about:\n- What is this regency council?\n- Who is on it?\n- How long will he be gone?\n- What authority does it have?\n- What happened at the Medina del Campo meeting?\n- Are they in danger from the Infantes while he's gone?\n- Can they work with Álvaro?\n- Why is he going on pilgrimage now of all times?\n\nThis is a big reveal and should be treated as such. The cabinet would need to process this information and ask clarifying questions.\n\nThe Pilgrimage Revealed\n\nThe room goes very still.\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval is the first to react, his nobleman's composure cracking slightly:\n\n\"Your Majesty... a regency council? And you're leaving on pilgrimage?\" He exchanges glances with the others. \"This... this is what was decided at Medina del Campo today?\"\n\nJuan de Daza leans forward, his administrator's mind immediately grasping implications:\n\n\"Your Majesty, forgive me, but—you've just formed this cabinet, and now you're announcing you'll be absent? For how long? Who sits on this regency council?\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique speaks bluntly, his scarred face showing concern:\n\n\"The Infantes. They're on this council, aren't they? Your Majesty, you just asked me about Granada and borders, and now you tell me you're leaving while giving the Infantes formal authority?\" He doesn't quite raise his voice, but the alarm is clear.\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza stands, his courtly polish slipping:\n\n\"Your Majesty, my family—the Mendozas—are we represented on this council? Or will we be subject to decisions made by...\" he pauses carefully, \"...others?\"\n\nLope de Barrientos asks the theological question:\n\n\"A pilgrimage, Your Majesty? Where? For what purpose? How long?\" His scholarly mind is working. \"Santiago de Compostela is traditional, but that's perhaps a month round trip. Are you going further?\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna remains silent, watching you carefully. He knows the plan, but the cabinet doesn't, and their concern is mounting rapidly.\n\nCaptain Fernán has moved slightly closer to you, his soldier's instinct responding to the sudden tension in the room.\n\nJuan de Daza speaks again, his voice controlled but urgent:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you ask if we can serve each other and Don Álvaro while you're gone. But we need to understand the situation we're being asked to navigate.\" He counts on his fingers:\n\n\"One: You're forming a regency council—who has what authority?\nTwo: You're going on pilgrimage—for how long and where?\nThree: You're leaving Don Álvaro in charge—but under what constraints?\nFour: We've just been recruited—are we known to this regency council? Are we targets? Are we protected?\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval adds firmly but respectfully:\n\n\"Your Majesty, we accepted positions in your cabinet. We pledged to serve you. But you're now telling us that within days, you'll be absent, and we'll be serving Don Álvaro under the supervision of a regency council that—I assume—includes the very Infantes you've been maneuvering against.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands:\n\n\"We need to understand what we've truly agreed to. What is the actual situation?\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique is more direct:\n\n\"Your Majesty, are you running away? Or is this some strategy I'm not seeing? Because from here, it looks like you've just negotiated your own irrelevance and are fleeing before it gets worse.\"\n\nThe veteran's bluntness is shocking, but there's genuine concern rather than disrespect in his voice.\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza says quietly:\n\n\"Or perhaps His Majesty is being very clever, and we simply don't yet understand the full plan.\" He looks at you. \"Your Majesty, if you expect us to serve effectively in your absence, we need to know what we're serving. What is the true purpose of this pilgrimage? What did you actually agree to with the Infantes? And what do you expect to achieve?\"\n\nAll five men are watching you intently. Álvaro remains still, clearly leaving this to you—it's your decision whether to reveal the full strategy or keep them partially in the dark.\n\nThe cabinet is concerned, confused, and slightly alarmed. They've just committed to you, and now you're announcing you'll be absent under circumstances that sound dangerous. They want—need—to understand what's really happening.\n\nHow much do you tell them? Do you reveal:\n\nThe full Rome plan and crusade strategy?\n\nJust the basic facts about the regency council?\n\nSomething in between?\n\nDo you explain your reasoning, or keep them on a need-to-know basis?"

It's been his dream to go on pilgrimage\n2. Strategic purpose: present as devout, test waters for crusade, confer with clergy\n3. No immediate crusade plan, but gathering information\n4. Regency council structure: Infante Juan, Infante Enrique, Archbishop of Toledo, Íñigo López de Mendoza\n5.

Royal Council meeting in November in Seville\n\nThe cabinet should respond with:\n- Some relief that there IS a plan\n- Concerns about the Infantes having real power\n- Questions about how they fit in\n- Thoughts on the risks\n- Practical questions about their role during his absence\n\nThe Cabinet Responds\n\nThe tension in the room eases somewhat as you explain. The men settle back, though concern doesn't entirely leave their faces.\n\nLope de Barrientos nods slowly, his scholar's mind working:\n\n\"A pilgrimage to gauge Church support for potential crusade... that makes theological and political sense, Your Majesty. Santiago de Compostela? Or further—perhaps visiting multiple shrines, multiple bishops, multiple monasteries?\" He's clearly trying to map your route and timeline.\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval absorbs the regency council structure:\n\n\"Infante Juan, Infante Enrique, the Archbishop of Toledo, and Íñigo López de Mendoza the elder—your family's Marquis de Santillana.\" He glances at the younger Íñigo in the room. \"That's... actually balanced, Your Majesty. Two Aragonese princes, one churchman, one powerful but cautiously loyal Castilian noble. They'll check each other.\"\n\nJuan de Daza is already calculating:\n\n\"Expenditures over 200,000 maravedís require approval. That's... significant but workable. Most routine administration falls below that threshold. Don Álvaro can maintain basic functions.\" He pauses. \"Though any major initiative would need council approval. They've effectively given themselves veto power over ambition.\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique grunts, still wary:\n\n\"Military deployments over 1,000 men. That means the Infantes must approve any significant military action. They can't easily stage a coup—you've given them legal authority instead, which satisfies their ambition without immediate violence.\" He nods grudgingly. \"Clever, if it holds. You've bought time.\"\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza (the younger) looks thoughtful:\n\n\"My uncle—the Marquis—on the council. That's... good for my family's position, but it also means I must be careful. If I'm seen as your man while he sits on the regency council, that creates... complexity.\" He meets your eyes. \"I can manage it, but I'll need to be discreet in how I report and serve.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval asks the practical question:\n\n\"Your Majesty, how long do you expect this pilgrimage to last? A month? Two? More?\"\n\nLope de Barrientos adds:\n\n\"And where specifically? Different shrines, different bishops—each tells us something about what information you're gathering and who you're cultivating relationships with.\"\n\nJuan de Daza focuses on his domain:\n\n\"During your absence, Your Majesty, you want us to serve Don Álvaro. What specifically should we be doing? Continue intelligence gathering as assigned? Report to Don Álvaro? And...\" he hesitates, \"...do the regency council members know we exist? Are we official, or are we... discreet?\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique is more direct:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you're testing Church support for crusade and presenting yourself as devout. Good. But four to six months away—and it will be that long if you're visiting multiple shrines and bishops—that's time for the Infantes to consolidate. What's our role in preventing that? What can we actually do with you gone?\"\n\nÁlvaro de Luna finally speaks, his voice measured:\n\n\"Gentlemen, His Majesty has made a calculated decision. He's given the Infantes formal authority to prevent them from seizing informal control. He's going on pilgrimage that serves genuine piety and strategic information-gathering. And he's built this cabinet to provide intelligence and support during his absence.\"\n\nHe looks at each of them:\n\n\"Your role is simple: continue gathering information in your assigned areas. Report to me. Help me understand what the nobility, the Church, the common people, the military, and the treasury are actually doing—not what they claim to be doing. The regency council will handle grand decisions. We handle reality.\"\n\nHe pauses:\n\n\"And no, you are not officially announced. You are the King's personal advisors, assembled quietly. The regency council may learn of you eventually, but they don't control you. You serve His Majesty, through me in his absence.\"\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval asks carefully:\n\n\"Don Álvaro, what happens if the regency council objects to our existence? If they demand we be dismissed or replaced with their own appointees?\"\n\nÁlvaro's eyes are hard:\n\n\"They may object. But His Majesty appointed you before leaving. You are established fact. And the regency council's authority covers major military, financial, and diplomatic decisions—not the King's right to have personal advisors.\" A slight pause. \"Though we should be prepared for them to test that boundary.\"\n\nLope de Barrientos ventures:\n\n\"Your Majesty, may I suggest something? If your pilgrimage includes visiting multiple bishops and discussing crusade prospects, I could provide introductions, letters of recommendation. The Dominican network is extensive. Knowing which bishops are sympathetic, which are political, which are genuine—that information could make your journey more productive.\"\n\nJuan de Daza adds:\n\n\"And Your Majesty, if you're gone for months, Don Álvaro will need accurate financial information to work within the 200,000 maravedí threshold. I can ensure he has daily updates on treasury status, so decisions don't accidentally trigger regency council review.\"\n\nRodrigo Manrique:\n\n\"If you're discussing crusade with military orders and frontier commanders, I can tell you who actually knows warfare and who's a political appointee. Save you from wasting time on fools who talk well but fight poorly.\"\n\nThey're beginning to see their roles. Not grand political maneuvering—that's locked down by the regency council—but intelligence, information, and support for Álvaro's administration.\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza says quietly:\n\n\"Your Majesty, one concern. The Royal Council meeting in November, in Seville—six months hence. That's after you return from pilgrimage?\" At your confirmation, he continues: \"So the sequence is: you leave, the Infantes govern through regency council for months, then you return and immediately convene a grand council where permanent structures are debated?\"\n\nHe looks thoughtful:\n\n\"They'll use those months to build support for their vision of governance. Cultivate allies, distribute favors, demonstrate effectiveness. When the Royal Council convenes, they'll arrive with momentum and support. You'll need to return with something equally compelling to counter their position.\"\n\nHis eyes meet yours:\n\n\"That's why the pilgrimage isn't just piety, is it? You're building your own legitimacy and support—religious authority, crusade possibility, whatever you learn from bishops and clergy. You'll return with spiritual authority to counter their temporal authority.\"\n\nHe's close to grasping the full plan, even without knowing about Rome.\n\nHow do you respond? Do you:\n\nConfirm you'll be visiting Santiago and perhaps other Spanish shrines?\n\nReveal the Rome destination?\n\nKeep the specifics vague?\n\nAddress their concerns about serving during your absence?\n\nGive them specific instructions for what to do while you're gone?"

Shall I have him brought to your private chapel?\"\n\nCaptain Fernán falls into step behind you as you leave, the cabinet members watching you depart with expressions mixing respect, concern, and calculation.\n\nPrivate Royal Chapel - Early Evening\n\nThe chapel is small, intimate—built for private royal devotion rather than grand ceremony. Candles flicker before a simple but beautiful crucifix. The evening light streams through stained glass windows depicting saints of Castile. The scent of incense lingers faintly.\n\nFray Hernando de Talavera waits by the altar, and your first impression is of intensity.\n\nHe's thirty-two, but his face has the weathered quality of someone who's lived austerely. His Hieronymite robes are clean but worn—not shabby, but clearly belonging to a man who takes his vow of poverty seriously. Dark hair tonsured in the monastic style, deep-set eyes that seem to look through surfaces to something deeper. His hands are calloused—he's done manual labor, not just scholarly work.\n\nWhen he sees you enter, he drops to his knees immediately, head bowed:\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His voice is surprisingly deep, with the accent of someone from humble origins—Talavera, a town of no particular distinction. \"I am unworthy of this honor. To serve as confessor to the Lord's anointed...\" He trails off, seemingly overwhelmed.\n\nCaptain Fernán takes position outside the chapel door, closing it to give you privacy.\n\nFray Hernando rises slowly, and you see something in his bearing—genuine humility, but also fierce conviction. This is a man who takes his faith with absolute seriousness.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I... forgive me, I have never confessed royalty before. I confess farmers, artisans, my brother monks. I do not know the courtly forms, the proper protocols.\" He meets your eyes, and there's no dissembling there. \"But I know sin, and I know God's mercy. If Your Majesty will accept a simple priest's service, I am yours to command.\"\n\nHe gestures to the confessional—a traditional wooden booth with screens for anonymity, though in private royal confession, such formality is often dispensed with.\n\n\"Shall we proceed in the traditional manner, Your Majesty? Or...\" he seems uncertain about protocol, \"...how does Your Majesty wish to conduct confession?\"\n\nThere's something refreshing about his complete lack of courtly polish. He's genuine, perhaps to a fault. You can see why Álvaro suggested him—this man has no political connections, no agenda beyond serving God. But you can also see the challenge: he will take his role as spiritual advisor seriously. He won't play games with your soul.\n\nHow do you wish to proceed with your first confession with Fray Hernando? Do you:\n\nUse the traditional confessional format?\n\nSpeak to him directly, face to face?\n\nWhat do you confess—and what do you carefully omit?\n\nHow do you establish your relationship with this man who will accompany you to Rome?"

The seal of confession is already sacred and inviolable in Catholic doctrine - a priest cannot reveal what's said in confession under any circumstances, even under torture or threat of death\n2. Juan is emphasizing the physical danger aspect - that people might kill to get this information\n3. This suggests Juan is about to reveal something significant - likely the Rome plan\n4. Fray Hernando, being genuinely pious and well-trained, would already know about the seal of confession\n5. But Juan's emphasis on the danger makes this personal and tests Hernando's courage as well as his fidelity\n\nFray Hernando should respond with:\n- Affirmation of the seal of confession as sacred Church law\n- Understanding of the gravity/danger Juan is highlighting\n- Possibly some indication of his own courage or commitment\n- But also perhaps some concern about what Juan is about to reveal that would be so dangerous\n\nThis is a good moment to establish their relationship - Juan testing Hernando's reliability, Hernando proving his worth as confessor.\n\nThe Seal of Confession\n\nFray Hernando's expression becomes grave, and he straightens to his full height. The humble uncertainty vanishes, replaced by something far more formidable:\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His voice is firm, carrying the weight of centuries of Church doctrine. \"The seal of confession is absolute and inviolable. It is not merely my word—it is sacred law, established by Holy Mother Church and enforced under pain of excommunication.\"\n\nHe steps closer, his intense eyes fixed on yours:\n\n\"If the Holy Inquisition itself demanded I reveal what you tell me in confession, I would refuse. If they tortured me, I would die before speaking. If they threatened my life, my family, my brothers in faith—still I would remain silent.\" His voice drops but loses none of its intensity. \"The seal of confession is not a courtesy, Your Majesty. It is a sacred trust between penitent, priest, and God alone.\"\n\nHe pauses, and his expression shifts slightly—concern mixing with resolve:\n\n\"That Your Majesty feels the need to ask suggests what you will tell me carries great weight. Perhaps great danger.\" He meets your eyes directly. \"I understand. Men have been murdered for secrets before. Kings have been betrayed by those they trusted.\"\n\nHis hand moves unconsciously to the wooden cross hanging from his rope belt:\n\n\"But know this: I am a simple monk. I own nothing but these robes and my faith. I have no family to threaten, no wealth to seize, no ambitions to leverage. If someone wishes to torture or kill me for what you say in confession, they will find only silence.\" A slight, grim smile. \"The Hieronymites have produced martyrs before. We can do so again if God wills it.\"\n\nHe kneels before you, his voice taking on the formal cadence of an oath:\n\n\"Before God, before His Son Jesus Christ, before the Virgin Mary and all the saints, I swear: whatever Your Majesty confesses to me shall remain between us and God alone. No power on earth, no threat, no inducement, no command shall break that seal. I would die first.\"\n\nHe looks up, and there's steel in those deep-set eyes:\n\n\"You have my word, Your Majesty. But more than that—you have God's law protecting you. The seal is not mine to break, even if I wished to. It belongs to the Church, to Christ Himself.\"\n\nHe rises slowly:\n\n\"Now... shall we begin? And Your Majesty,\" he adds quietly, \"whatever burden you carry, whatever secret weighs upon your soul—confession is meant to lighten that burden, not increase it. Trust in God's mercy. Trust in the seal. And speak freely.\"\n\nHe gestures toward the confessional, or toward the simple chairs near the altar if you prefer face-to-face confession.\n\nThe chapel feels very quiet, very safe. This man will not betray you—not from fear of consequences, but from absolute conviction in his sacred duty.\n\nHow do you proceed? What do you tell Fray Hernando in this first confession?"

But it's also clearly sincere - Juan isn't just manipulating his confessor, he's expressing real spiritual struggle.\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\nThere's a long silence from the other side of the screen. When Fray Hernando finally speaks, his voice carries deep emotion - not judgment, but something like recognition:\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" He pauses, corrects himself to the proper form: \"My son, what you describe is not sin. It is the burden of kingship.\"\n\nYou hear him shift in the confessional, leaning closer to the screen:\n\n\"You speak of God's kingdom on earth. Of wanting purity. Of being sickened by the corruption around you.\" His voice strengthens. \"Do you know what I hear? I hear a young king who has not yet had his soul corrupted by power. I hear someone who still sees the rot, who still feels revulsion at it. That is grace, my son. That is the Holy Spirit preserving your conscience.\"\n\nHe takes a breath:\n\n\"King David - the Lord's anointed, a man after God's own heart - had to make alliances with his enemies. He had to navigate the politics of Saul's court. He had to dance, as you say, with men who wanted him dead. And yet God loved David, because David's heart remained pure even when his actions had to be... strategic.\"\n\nA pause, then more gently:\n\n\"You say you feel tainted. Tell me - when you play this game, when you negotiate with proud nobles and make compromises, what is in your heart? Do you do it for your own glory? For your own power? Or do you do it because you see no other way to eventually build something good?\"\n\nThrough the screen, you can see his silhouette - he's leaning forward intently, waiting for your answer.\n\n\"The difference between a righteous king and a corrupt one is not whether they engage in politics - they must. The difference is why. A corrupt king plays the game to aggrandize himself. A righteous king plays it as a necessary evil, a means to an eventual good end, and he hates that he must do so.\"\n\nHis voice drops, becoming almost intimate:\n\n\"Your Majesty - my son - you describe feeling sick at having to be an accomplice in the nobles' farce. Do you know what that tells me? That your soul is still healthy. The day you stop feeling sick, the day you start enjoying the manipulation and deception - that is when you should worry. But now? Your conscience still works. Your heart still yearns for purity.\"\n\nAnother pause, then:\n\n\"Jesus Christ himself had to navigate the politics of the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Roman occupation. He spoke in parables specifically because direct truth would have gotten him killed before his mission was complete. He was strategic. He was careful. And yet he was sinless.\"\n\nYou hear him settle back slightly:\n\n\"Now, let me ask you this, and answer honestly: when you engage in these political games, these deceptions with the nobles - have you done so with cruelty? Have you destroyed innocent people? Have you lied under oath before God? Have you broken sacred vows? Or have you simply... been wise as serpents while trying to remain innocent as doves?\"\n\nHis question hangs in the air. He's trying to determine whether your political maneuvering has crossed into actual sin, or whether it's simply the necessary prudence of a king trying to survive in a corrupt environment.\n\n\"Tell me, my son - in your dealings with these nobles, with the Infantes, with all who surround you - have you committed specific sins? Actual transgressions against God's law? Or do you confess a feeling, a spiritual burden, rather than concrete wrongdoing?\"\n\nHow do you respond? Do you:\n\nAdmit to specific deceptions (the performance at Medina del Campo)?\n\nConfess your plan to \"manage confessions\" regarding Rome?\n\nClaim only the burden of feeling tainted, not specific sins?\n\nReveal more about your actual intentions and plans?"

          "text": "That last question is particularly interesting. Why would Juan ask this? A few possibilities:\n- He's testing whether Fray Hernando would believe a claim of divine vision\n- He's genuinely asking because he's had some kind of spiritual experience\n- He's laying groundwork to potentially claim divine inspiration for the crusade\n- He's thinking about Joan of Arc and her visions (she's active right now in France)\n- He's considering how to present his pilgrimage/crusade plans in spiritual terms\n\nThis is a clever young king probing to understand how religious authority works. Fray Hernando would be cautious here - false claims of divine visions are serious business, but genuine spiritual experiences are also real in medieval Catholic theology.\n\nFray Hernando should:\n1. Address the deception issue first\n2. Then carefully address the question about visions\n3. Be both theologically sound and pastorally sensitive\n4. Perhaps probe gently about why Juan is asking\n\nThis is a delicate moment where Juan might be testing how much he can use religious language for political ends, or genuinely exploring his own spiritual experiences.\n\nThe Question of Visions\n\nFray Hernando is quiet for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice is thoughtful:\n\n\"First, let me address your deceptions. That you do not fully trust even your advisors - this is prudence, not sin. A king must guard certain knowledge. Discretion is wisdom.\" He pauses. \"But tell me - in these deceptions, do you claim falsehoods as divine truth? Do you swear lies in God's name? Do you use the sacraments as tools of manipulation?\"\n\nHe waits for your response, then continues:\n\n\"If not, then you walk a narrow path - but it is a path that righteous kings have walked before. Keep your conscience sharp. The moment deception becomes comfortable rather than necessary, examine yourself.\"\n\nAnother pause, then his tone shifts - becomes more careful, more probing:\n\n\"Now... your question about visions and divine communication.\" There's a weight to how he says this. \"My son, this is not an idle theological question, is it? Why do you ask?\"\n\nThrough the screen, you sense him leaning closer:\n\n\"I will answer you honestly, because you deserve truth. But first, understand: this is dangerous territory. False claims of divine vision are grave sin - they use God's name to deceive. The Church investigates such claims carefully, sometimes harshly. Joan of Valois claims visions even now in France, and the theologians debate whether she speaks for God or deludes herself or worse.\"\n\nHe takes a breath:\n\n\"That said - divine communication takes many forms. The theologians distinguish between several types:\n\nMiraculous visions - what you describe. Burning bushes, thunderclaps, angels appearing in glory. These are rare, reserved for prophets and saints. Most Christians never experience them. When they do occur, they are unmistakable, overwhelming, often witnessed by others.\n\nIntellectual illumination - this is more common among the faithful. You pray, you struggle with a problem, and suddenly clarity comes. Not a voice, not a vision, but a profound knowing. The answer feels placed in your mind by something beyond yourself. Saint Thomas Aquinas experienced this often.\n\nConsolation and conviction - the Holy Spirit working through prayer. You pray earnestly, and you feel peace about a particular course of action. Or you feel deep unease about another. Not dramatic, but persistent and clear.\n\nProphetic insight - rare, but documented. A sudden understanding of future events or hidden truths that proves accurate. This can be divine, but could also be natural intuition or even diabolic deception. Very difficult to discern.\"\n\nHe pauses significantly:\n\n\"The Church teaches that we must test such experiences. Saint Paul says 'test the spirits.' Saint Ignatius teaches discernment of spirits. How do we know if something comes from God, from our own mind, or from darker sources?\"\n\nHis voice becomes almost pedagogical:\n\n\"Signs it may be from God:\n\nIt leads toward humility, charity, and obedience to Church teaching\n\nIt brings peace, even if the path is difficult\n\nIt aligns with Scripture and doctrine\n\nIt serves others' good, not just your own ambition\n\nIt remains consistent over time, growing stronger in prayer\n\nIt bears good fruit in your life and others'\n\nSigns it may be false:\n\nIt puffs up pride - 'God chose me specially'\n\nIt contradicts Church teaching\n\nIt serves primarily your own interests\n\nIt brings agitation rather than peace\n\nIt changes frequently or disappears under scrutiny\n\nIt isolates you from spiritual counsel\"\n\nThere's a long pause, then very gently:\n\n\"My son... have you experienced something you believe might be divine communication? Is that why you ask?\"\n\nHis voice carries no judgment, only pastoral concern and sharp curiosity.\n\n\"If you have, you should tell me. Not because I doubt you, but because you need spiritual discernment. If God truly speaks to you, that is a great gift - but also a great burden. You would need guidance to understand it properly, to avoid self-deception or manipulation by others.\"\n\nThrough the screen, you sense him waiting - this humble monk who just explained that he would recognize the difference between genuine divine inspiration and political manipulation disguised as piety.\n\n\"Why do you ask about visions, Your Majesty? What prompts this question in the middle of your confession?\"\n\nHow do you respond? Do you:\n\nClaim you've had some kind of spiritual experience?\n\nSay you're just curious about Joan of Arc's visions?\n\nAdmit you're trying to understand how to legitimize your crusade plans?\n\nDeflect the question?\n\nTell him something closer to the truth about your strategic thinking?"

He's being somewhat honest - he does seem genuinely pious, and is mixing real devotion with political strategy\n5.

When Fray Hernando finally speaks, his voice is careful, measured:\n\n\"My son... what you describe is not miraculous vision. But it may be something more valuable - spiritual sensitivity. The ability to see beyond surface appearances to the deeper reality of grace and sin.\"\n\nHe shifts in the confessional:\n\n\"Many people walk through life blind to these glimpses you describe. They see a mother and child, but not the love of God reflected there. They see death and only feel horror, not the beauty of a soul returning home. That you notice these things, that you feel them deeply - this suggests a contemplative soul, one attuned to spiritual realities.\"\n\nA pause, then more cautiously:\n\n\"But I must ask you difficult questions now, because this is precisely where self-deception enters. Where our own desires become confused with God's will.\"\n\nHis voice becomes firmer, more probing:\n\n\"You say you feel a 'pull' toward Santiago, but also toward Rome. A terrifying thought, you say, because you'd be leaving your kingdom for some time.\" He lets that hang in the air. \"My son, let me be direct: why Rome specifically? Santiago de Compostela is one of Christendom's holiest sites. It would fulfill any pilgrimage vow, demonstrate piety, and take perhaps a month. Rome would take four to six months, possibly more.\"\n\nThrough the screen, you sense his intense focus:\n\n\"When you feel this 'pull' toward Rome - what accompanies it? Is it peace? Or is it also... ambition? Calculation? The knowledge that a personal audience with the Holy Father might accomplish certain political goals?\"\n\nThe question is not accusatory, but genuinely probing.\n\n\"I ask because the human heart is complex. We can experience both genuine spiritual calling and worldly calculation at the same time. Sometimes they intertwine so thoroughly we cannot separate them ourselves. Saint Ignatius teaches this - that we must examine not just what we desire, but why we desire it.\"\n\nHe leans closer to the screen:\n\n\"Tell me honestly - and remember, this is confession, between you, me, and God alone - when you think of going to Rome, what do you hope to find there? What do you hope to accomplish?\"\n\nA pause, then more gently:\n\n\"I am not accusing you of false piety. I believe your devotion is genuine. I see it in how you speak, in your anguish at the corruption around you. But genuine devotion can still become entangled with political necessity. The question is: are you going to Rome primarily to seek God's will? Or are you going to seek the Pope's support for something you've already decided to do?\"\n\nHis voice softens further:\n\n\"There is no shame in the latter, understand. Kings must think politically. A pilgrimage can serve both spiritual and temporal purposes - David's journey to the Tabernacle served his kingship even as it served his faith. But you must be honest with yourself about your motivations, or you risk using God's name to baptize your own ambitions.\"\n\nThrough the screen, you hear him take a breath:\n\n\"So I ask again: Why Rome? What specifically do you believe God is calling you to seek there? And...\" a significant pause, \"...what would you seek from the Holy Father if you went?\"\n\nHe's given you an opening - he's not dismissing your spiritual experience, but he's also not letting you hide political calculation behind mystical language. He wants the truth, or at least as much truth as you're willing to give in the confessional.\n\n\"And understand, my son - if you tell me you're going to Rome to seek a crusade bull, to gain papal legitimacy for your rule, to position yourself against rivals - that is not necessarily sin. Kings must do such things. The question is whether you're being honest about it, especially with yourself.\"\n\nHis voice drops to almost a whisper:\n\n\"The gravest danger is not that you mix piety with politics. It's that you deceive yourself into thinking political calculation is divine calling. That way lies madness - or worse, becoming like those corrupt nobles you despise, using God's name to justify ambition while telling yourself it's holy.\"\n\nHe waits for your response, and you can sense both challenge and compassion in his silence.\n\nHow do you respond? Do you:\n\nAdmit the political calculations openly?\n\nMaintain that it's primarily spiritual calling?\n\nTry to explain how the two are genuinely intertwined for you?\n\nDeflect or keep some cards close?\n\nAsk him directly if he would support the Rome journey?"

Banners of Castile and León hang from the vaulted ceiling alongside the standards of the great houses. Candles burn in iron stands despite the morning light streaming through high windows. The air smells of incense, beeswax, and the nervous sweat of gathered nobles.\n\nPerhaps sixty witnesses have assembled - a carefully curated audience:\n\nThe great nobles: Representatives from Mendoza, Velasco, Estúñiga, and other major houses. They stand in small clusters, watching everything with calculating eyes.\n\nChurch hierarchy: Bishops and abbots, their rich vestments making them unmistakable. They murmur among themselves.\n\nCity representatives: From Valladolid, Burgos, Toledo, Seville. Merchants and town officials in fine but practical clothing.\n\nThe Infantes' faction: Perhaps a dozen nobles who've aligned themselves clearly with Juan and Enrique. They look almost triumphant.\n\nAt the center of it all, a raised dais has been prepared with five chairs. Four are arranged in a semi-circle facing the assembled witnesses. The fifth - the throne - sits slightly elevated and centered.\n\nThe Ceremony Begins\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stands to one side of the dais, his constable's chain of office gleaming. His face is perfectly composed, showing nothing. Captain Fernán and the royal guard line the walls in their new equipment - an impressive display.\n\nThe four council members stand before their chairs:\n\nInfante Juan de Aragón - dressed in rich but dignified clothing, every inch the senior prince. His expression is solemn, appropriate for the occasion.\n\nInfante Enrique de Aragón - martial bearing evident even in courtly dress. He looks less comfortable with ceremony than his brother.\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo, Juan Martínez de Contreras - Age ~50, imposing in full episcopal regalia. His face is weathered, intelligent, politically astute. A powerful churchman who's navigated court politics for decades.\n\nÍñigo López de Mendoza, Marquis de Santillana - Age ~50, patriarch of the Mendoza family. Distinguished, cultured, wearing the understated elegance of old money and older nobility. He's watching you with particular intensity.\n\nYou enter from the private royal chambers. The assembly rises as one. You're dressed in full royal regalia - crown, scepter, robes of state. Every inch a king, despite your eighteen years.\n\nYou take your seat on the throne.\n\nThe room settles into expectant silence.\n\nWhat do you say to open this ceremony? How do you frame what's about to happen?"

I intend to take my time and travel where the lord takes me before returning home. Like I said, my journey is not known to me fully, but I do intend to visit Santiago along the way.\n\n\nIn order to secure the kingdom in my absence, I have seen fit to install a regency council to rule in my stead. Don Alvaro will rule in my stead and is assisted by a council that will provide oversight and provide guidance on important decisions. I am very grateful to the Mendoza family, the honoured archbishop and my cousins who have seen fit to accept the position on this council. The details of the council are written down in this document here and copies are to be distributed among you. In essence, it comes down to that I effectively let the council rule by three fourth majority temporarily. As soon as I return from my pilgrimage, the regency council is disbanded immediately.\n\n\nFinally, we will see each other again in half a year in Sevilla when I have seen fit to convene a council to assist me in facing the realm's challenges. Now, please join me in prayer for the realm and please pray for me when I am on my journey."

He's emphasizing it's temporary, he's maintaining that Álvaro rules \"in his stead\" with council oversight, and he's set a clear end date. They're probably satisfied but also calculating.\n\n2. The Archbishop - a churchman would approve of pilgrimage on religious grounds, but might have concerns about the political implications.\n\n3. The Mendoza patriarch - his family is represented on the council, which is good for them, but he's probably assessing what this means for the balance of power.\n\n4. Other nobles - probably mixed reactions. Some might be alarmed that the Infantes are getting formal power. Others might see this as the king being weak.\n\n5. Álvaro de Luna - publicly he must show nothing, but this is a difficult moment for him.\n\nThe user also wants me to keep responses shorter and more conversational, stopping at natural interaction points. So I should describe the immediate reactions and then pause for the prayer or next action, not write a huge monologue.\n\nLet me write the immediate reactions to the announcement, then stop at the prayer moment.\n\nThe Announcement\n\nYour words echo through the great hall. The silence that follows is profound - everyone processing what they've just heard.\n\nInfante Juan steps forward first, dropping to one knee with practiced grace:\n\n\"Your Majesty honors us beyond measure. We accept this sacred trust and will guard your realm as our own.\" His voice carries throughout the hall. \"May God guide your pilgrimage and return you safely to us.\"\n\nInfante Enrique follows suit, kneeling beside his brother. More martial, less eloquent, but the gesture is clear.\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo raises his hand in blessing:\n\n\"The Church rejoices that our young king seeks spiritual guidance through holy pilgrimage. We will pray daily for your safe journey and swift return.\" His eyes are sharp though - he's a political creature assessing implications.\n\nThe Marquis de Santillana - the elder Íñigo López de Mendoza - kneels last:\n\n\"The house of Mendoza is honored to serve Castile in this capacity. Your Majesty's trust will not be misplaced.\"\n\nThroughout the hall, reactions ripple:\n\nThe Infantes' faction looks pleased, even triumphant. Whispers of satisfaction.\n\nOther nobles show mixed expressions - concern, calculation, some looking alarmed.\n\nThe bishops seem genuinely approving of the pilgrimage announcement.\n\nCity representatives appear uncertain what this means for them.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stands perfectly still, his face a mask. Only someone who knows him well would catch the tightness around his eyes.\n\nYou've called for prayer.

The assembly follows your lead - nobles, churchmen, merchants, soldiers - all kneeling. The great hall fills with the rustle of fabric and creak of joints.\n\nThe Archbishop's voice rises, formal and sonorous:\n\n\"Almighty and everlasting God, who hast set Thy servant Juan upon the throne of Castile and León, we beseech Thee to watch over him as he undertakes this holy pilgrimage.

This is smart - he wants to understand the concerns and perhaps reassure or assess potential allies/problems.\n\nLet me think about who would be most visibly worried:\n\n1. Nobles NOT in the Infantes' faction who now see the Infantes with formal power\n2. Álvaro's known supporters who worry about his position\n3. Smaller nobles/cities who fear being squeezed out\n4. Perhaps some churchmen worried about secular power dynamics\n\nI should present a few different worried parties for Juan to approach, showing different types of concerns. Keep it conversational and dynamic.\n\nReading the Room\n\nAs you rise and begin moving through the assembly, the crowd parts respectfully. You can immediately identify several clusters of concern:\n\nNear the Western Wall\n\nPedro de Velasco, a count from the Velasco family (rivals to the Mendozas), stands with two other northern nobles. They're not openly hostile, but their body language is tense. When you approach, Velasco bows:\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" He hesitates, then speaks carefully. \"May I speak plainly?\"\n\nAt your nod:\n\n\"Six months is a long time. And a three-quarters majority on the council...\" He glances toward where the Infantes stand accepting congratulations. \"The two brothers vote together. They need only one more vote to control any decision. The Archbishop, or the Marquis.\"\n\nOne of his companions adds quietly:\n\n\"What happens to those of us not represented on the council, Your Majesty? Do we petition the Infantes for justice? For royal favor?\"\n\nThere's real anxiety here - nobles worried about being shut out of power.\n\nBy the Southern Columns\n\nRepresentatives from Seville and Córdoba - wealthy southern cities - are speaking in low, urgent tones. When you approach, they bow deeply.\n\nThe elder, a merchant named García Fernández, speaks:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the southern cities rejoice at your choice of Seville for the Royal Council. But...\" He looks uncomfortable. \"Forgive me, but who speaks for the cities during your absence? The regency council is princes, church, and high nobility. What of urban concerns? Trade disputes? Tax matters?\"\n\nHis companion from Córdoba adds:\n\n\"And Your Majesty, the frontier cities depend on royal justice between nobles and townsmen. Will the council hear our cases? Or will we be at the mercy of local lords for six months?\"\n\nThey're worried about being trampled by noble interests without royal protection.\n\nNear the Eastern Entrance\n\nJuan de Silva, a mid-ranking noble known to be in Álvaro's network of supporters, stands somewhat isolated. When you approach, he bows stiffly:\n\n\"Your Majesty performs his devotions, and we are honored.\" His tone is neutral but his eyes are worried. \"Don Álvaro serves brilliantly, but...\" He looks around to ensure he's not overheard. \"The constable has enemies who now sit on the council that oversees him. What protection does he have if they move against him? If they block his every decision?\"\n\nHe's essentially asking: have you just hung Álvaro out to dry?\n\nIn a Quiet Corner\n\nFray Lope de Barrientos, your new cabinet member, has positioned himself discreetly. When you catch his eye, he approaches and bows:\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" Very quietly: \"Several bishops are asking me privately about the nature of your pilgrimage. How long. Where exactly. Whether you carry papal correspondence.\" He pauses. \"Should I tell them you're simply following God's guidance? Or is there more they should know?\"\n\nHe's asking how much to reveal about your actual plans.\n\nWhich group do you wish to address first? Or do you speak to someone else entirely?"

Given his earlier strategic thinking, it's probably the latter - he can't show doubt publicly about the arrangement he just announced.\n\nJuan de Silva would likely be somewhat taken aback by this response, but as a subordinate noble, he can't really push back against the king's stated optimism. He might accept it outwardly while remaining privately worried.\n\nI should keep this brief and stop at the next natural interaction point.\n\nDe Silva's Retreat\n\nJuan de Silva blinks, clearly not expecting such... optimism. He bows quickly:\n\n\"Of course, Your Majesty. You are right to have faith.\" His tone suggests he's saying what's expected rather than what he believes. \"Don Álvaro will manage, I'm sure.\"\n\nHe steps back, dismissed but still looking troubled.\n\nAcross the hall, you catch Fray Lope de Barrientos acknowledging your nod with a slight bow. He remains where he is - patient, discreet, waiting for you to come to him when ready.\n\nThe ceremony is winding down. Nobles are beginning to drift toward the exits, already forming new conversations and alliances based on what they've just witnessed.\n\nDo you approach Fray Lope, or is there someone else you wish to speak with before the assembly fully disperses?"

What if you could observe their first moves, catch them revealing their true intentions before the regency even truly begins?\n\nTechnically, the regency only takes effect in your absence.

He looks both excited and anxious.\n\nFour servants managing supplies and pack horses.\n\nA royal secretary to handle any correspondence.\n\nAbout thirty people total - enough to be properly royal, not so many as to be unwieldy.\n\nA small crowd has gathered to witness the departure. Nobles, palace officials, common folk from the city. Word spread quickly that the king departs on pilgrimage.\n\nÁlvaro de Luna stands at the palace steps.

Merchants pause their work. Children point and stare.

The Infantes would need very good intelligence and quick reactions to have learned about this. But it's not \"High probability\" because there were some suspicious elements (the unusual prayer request, Fray Hernando's suspicions).\n\n**How aggressive will the Infantes be?**\n\nThis depends on several factors:\n- They believe Juan is truly gone (if the subterfuge worked)\n- This is their FIRST meeting - they want to establish precedent and momentum\n- But they're also politically sophisticated - they know going too far too fast could backfire\n\n- They have a strategic window of 6 months to carefully consolidate power\n- Their goal is to appear reasonable while subtly expanding their influence\n- They'll balance between seeming responsible and making calculated power moves\n\nI anticipate they'll likely choose a moderate approach - making a few strategic appointments and subtle restrictions, but avoiding any dramatic overreach that might provoke immediate backlash or intervention.\n\nThe messenger's report of prepared documents suggests they've thoughtfully planned their initial moves. Their confidence implies they're ready to test boundaries and establish new precedents, making a substantive power play quite probable.\n\nThe likelihood of success seems high, with their political sophistication guiding them to make meaningful yet not overtly aggressive changes during this critical first day of regency.\n\nProbability Assessment - The Subterfuge\n\nAction 1: Has your deception remained secret?\n\nAssessment: Likely to succeed\n\nFactors supporting success:\n\nExtremely tight circle of knowledge (only you, Álvaro, and the two guards know the full plan)\n\nThe two guards only learned the truth this morning - too late for leaks\n\nYour public departure looked completely legitimate to dozens of witnesses\n\n\"Divine inspiration\" explanation was consistent with your pious reputation\n\nShort timeline (only 3 days) limited opportunity for intelligence gathering\n\nRemote hiding location, pre-positioned supplies done discreetly\n\nThe Infantes left Valladolid believing you were departing\n\nFactors against success:\n\nFray Hernando suspects something beyond simple prayer - he's perceptive and knows you from confession\n\nCaptain Fernán was visibly troubled and might have expressed concerns to others\n\nThe request to stay alone at a remote hermitage was highly unusual\n\nThe Infantes have their own intelligence networks in Valladolid\n\nPalace servants gossip, and Álvaro's preparations (supplies to the hut) could have been noticed\n\nIf anyone in Álvaro's household is compromised, word could have reached the Infantes\n\nConclusion: Likely to succeed - Your preparations have been careful and the knowledge circle tight, but there were some suspicious elements that sharp observers might have noted.\n\nAction 2: Will the Infantes make significant moves in this first meeting?\n\nAssessment: Likely to succeed (that they WILL make meaningful moves)\n\nFactors suggesting they'll act boldly:\n\nThey believe you're truly gone for months - this is their window\n\nThe messenger reported they're \"eager and confident\" with \"prepared documents\"\n\nFirst meetings set precedent - they want to establish their authority immediately\n\nThey've waited years for this opportunity and have clear grievances against Álvaro\n\nInfante Juan is politically sophisticated and will want to move quickly while momentum favors them\n\nThey have 6 months ahead, but consolidating power early makes the rest easier\n\nFactors suggesting they'll be cautious:\n\nThey're politically experienced and know overreach can backfire\n\nThe regency agreement gives them time - no need to rush everything into one meeting\n\nThey want to appear reasonable and responsible to other nobles\n\nGoing too far too fast could unite opposition against them\n\nÁlvaro is present and will resist openly bad-faith moves\n\nConclusion: Likely to succeed - They will almost certainly make some significant moves (appointments, restrictions on Álvaro, establishing procedures that favor them), but probably won't attempt a complete power grab in one meeting. The \"prepared documents\" suggests substantive action planned.\n\nPlease roll for both actions and tell me the results:\n\nSubterfuge remaining secret: Great Success / Success / Failure / Catastrophic Failure\n\nInfantes making significant moves: Great Success / Success / Failure / Catastrophic Failure"

This is great for Juan because he'll catch them being extremely overreaching. Maybe they're not just making reasonable administrative moves, but actually trying to:\n- Remove or replace key Álvaro loyalists\n- Seize control of royal finances beyond what the agreement allows\n- Make appointments that should require Juan's approval\n- Perhaps even discussing how to prevent Juan's return or limit his power when he comes back\n- Maybe they're being overconfident because they think he's gone and are revealing their true intentions\n\nThe combination is interesting: they have SOME inkling something might be off (status quo on secrecy) but they're so eager and confident that they're proceeding with aggressive moves anyway.

The crown settles on your head - familiar weight, reminder of authority. You strap your father's sword to your belt, giving truth to the excuse you'll use.\n\nSergeant García checks your appearance:\n\n\"Every inch a king, Your Majesty.\"\n\nCorporal Rodrigo is already saddling the horses.\n\nYou wait perhaps another twenty minutes - letting the meeting get well underway - then mount up and ride.\n\nThe Palace - Approaching the Council Chamber\n\nYou enter through a side gate, your guards flanking you. Palace servants do double-takes - wasn't the King supposed to be gone? - but you move with such purpose they simply bow and scramble out of your way.\n\nAs you approach the council chamber, you hear raised voices. Álvaro's voice, sharp with barely controlled anger:\n\n\"—absolutely exceeds the council's authority! The agreement specified—\"\n\nInfante Juan's voice, smooth but firm:\n\n\"The agreement gives us oversight of major decisions. Replacing a compromised treasury official certainly qualifies.\"\n\nThe Archbishop's deeper tone:\n\n\"Gentlemen, perhaps we should document this properly before—\"\n\nYou're nearly at the door. The guards posted outside look shocked to see you. One starts to announce you, but you shake your head - you want to hear more first.\n\nInfante Enrique's voice, more aggressive:\n\n\"And the royal guard needs restructuring. Too many men loyal to the Constable personally rather than the crown. We should appoint—\"\n\nÁlvaro, cutting in:\n\n\"You mean loyal to the King. Or have you forgotten who actually rules Castile?\"\n\nA tense silence, then Infante Juan again:\n\n\"Which brings us to the final matter. The Marquis and I have discussed this.

That's a significant constitutional change. The other nobles would need to—\"\n\nInfante Enrique, bluntly:\n\n\"The other nobles will accept it if presented correctly. 'Ensuring stable governance,' 'preventing rash decisions,' 'protecting the realm from youthful impulse.' It's for Castile's good.\"\n\nInfante Juan again:\n\n\"Exactly.

The King is anointed by God. Permanent restrictions on his authority would require papal approval and—\"\n\nInfante Juan, smoothly:\n\n\"Which is why we don't call them 'restrictions.' We call it 'wise counsel that the King graciously accepts.' We formalize what already exists informally. And by November, with six months of successful governance under our direction, the assembled nobles will see the wisdom—\"\n\nA pause, then Infante Enrique:\n\n\"Brother, are we certain he won't return early? That business at the hermitage—Captain Fernán seemed troubled when he arrived in the city yesterday.\"\n\nInfante Juan, dismissively:\n\n\"Divine inspiration, the Captain said.

That seems a reasonable compromise - Daza continues his duties, the council receives the information they need for oversight.\"\n\nInfante Enrique looks frustrated but nods grudgingly:\n\n\"That would be... acceptable. If we receive the same financial information.\"\n\nHe's conceding the point. The attempt to remove Daza has failed.\n\nThe Archbishop looks relieved at the compromise:\n\n\"Then are we agreed? Juan de Daza remains, treasury reports are shared with the council?\"\n\nWhat do you say?"

Nothing requiring immediate council attention.\"\n\nThe Archbishop raises a hand:\n\n\"Your Majesty, there is one matter.

Used \"divine inspiration\" as cover for a political trap\n2. Just openly admitted to everyone it wasn't actually divine guidance, just his own planning\n3. But also said \"God was gracious to let it succeed\"\n\nFray Hernando is going to be concerned about:\n- The use of piety as political cover\n- Whether Juan is being honest with himself about his motivations\n- The moral implications of the deception and threats\n- Whether this is the path of a righteous king or a manipulative one\n\nBut he's also Juan's confessor and servant. He needs to balance spiritual guidance with his role.\n\nThis should be a short, direct conversation where Fray Hernando expresses his concern and asks Juan a pointed question or two, then waits for response. Not a long monologue.\n\nPrivate Conversation with Fray Hernando\n\nThe monk walks with you away from the firelight, into the darkness at the edge of camp. When he speaks, his voice is quiet but firm:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you told everyone back there that you used prayer and divine guidance as... a cover. For political maneuvering.\"\n\nHe turns to face you:\n\n\"I am glad you were honest with them about that. But Your Majesty, do you remember what we discussed in confession? About the danger of confusing your own will with God's voice?\"\n\nHis eyes are intense in the darkness:\n\n\"You deceived your companions, set a trap for your enemies, threatened a prince's life, then returned and admitted it was all calculation. Was any of it genuine? The prayer at the hermitage? The claim that God showed you the way?\"\n\nHe's not accusing - he's asking. Genuinely trying to understand where your soul stands.\n\n\"Because if you use prayer as theater, as political tool, you poison the well of your own faith. Eventually you won't be able to tell the difference anymore.\"\n\nHe waits for your answer.\n\nHow do you respond?"

But he's also a Hieronymite monk - a relatively new order (founded in 14th century) focused on contemplation, scholarship, and austere living. He would have a sophisticated understanding of prayer.\n\nFray Hernando's Answer\n\nThe monk is quiet for a moment, considering your question seriously:\n\n\"When I pray, Your Majesty... I seek to empty myself. To quiet my own thoughts, my own desires, my own cleverness.\" He looks up at the stars. \"Sometimes I succeed. More often I fail.\"\n\nHe turns back to you:\n\n\"My thoughts wander constantly. I think about the monastery accounts, about a passage of Scripture I'm struggling with, about whether I said something foolish to a brother monk. Sometimes I'm reciting prayers while mentally arguing with someone from three years ago.\"\n\nA slight, rueful smile:\n\n\"Prayer is hard work, Your Majesty. It's the struggle to distinguish between God's voice and the endless chatter of my own mind. Saint John of the Cross calls it 'the dark night' - when you cannot hear God at all, only yourself.\"\n\nHe steps closer:\n\n\"But when I do hear something beyond myself - it's not words. It's... clarity. Peace about a direction. Or profound unease about another. A knowing that doesn't come from reasoning.\"\n\nHe pauses:\n\n\"Is that what you experienced, Your Majesty? When you prayed at the hermitage and decided to return - was it calculation, or was it that deeper knowing?\"\n\nHe's asking you to be honest with yourself as much as with him.\n\nHow do you answer?"

I have never heard anything beyond myself like you have.\n\n\nI spent a good hour thinking about where I was, what I was about to do and how to do it. And how it would serve God. Then I got up and did it. I stayed behind because I needed an excuse to stay behind. I could also have said I needed to take an enourmous shit. Or that I needed to go hunting or anything else.

He doesn't separate his faith from his politics - they're intertwined\n\nFray Hernando needs to respond to this. He's a spiritual director trying to guide a young king who is both genuinely pious and politically calculating. This is exactly the kind of spiritual complexity that real confessors dealt with.\n\nHernando should:\n- Acknowledge the honesty\n- Recognize the genuine piety mixed with calculation\n- But also warn about the dangers\n- Not condemn, but guide\n- Show understanding but maintain his role as spiritual guardian\n\nKeep it concise - just Hernando's response, then ask what Juan does.\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\nThe monk is silent for a long moment.

God showing you what goodness looks like. But then you take those glimpses and say 'therefore I must scheme, manipulate, trap my enemies.' Do you see? The leap from vision to action may be your will, not His.\"\n\nHe steps closer:\n\n\"I believe your piety is genuine, Your Majesty. I believe you truly want God's kingdom. But wanting a holy end doesn't make every means holy. That path leads to the Inquisition - people who torture in God's name because they're certain their purpose is righteous.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes:\n\n\"Will you let me guide you?

Or will you create a population of false converts who resent their conquerors and practice Islam in secret?\"\n\nHe drops his hand:\n\n\"Your Majesty, the goal may be holy. But that doesn't mean every path to it serves God. Saint Augustine wrestled with this - can Christians wage just war? Perhaps. But Augustine also warned against using piety to dress up ambition.\"\n\nHe looks at you intently:\n\n\"So tell me honestly: if you could achieve a stable, unified Castile without crusade against Granada, would you still pursue the crusade?

He understands the world but won't compromise on moral principles just because they're inconvenient.\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\nFray Hernando doesn't flinch from the question:\n\n\"Remotely possible? Perhaps not. Granada has held for centuries. The Nasrid sultans show no signs of voluntary conversion. Peaceful missionary work has achieved... little.\"\n\nHe pauses:\n\n\"But Your Majesty, 'nearly impossible' is not the same as 'therefore violence is justified.' The question is: have you tried? Have you sent embassies offering genuine peace and religious dialogue? Have you supported missionaries? Have you demonstrated Christian virtue so compelling that even Muslims might be moved?\"\n\nHis voice is gentle but firm:\n\n\"Or do you skip directly to 'it's impossible, therefore crusade is the only way' because crusade also serves your political needs? That's my concern, Your Majesty. Not that you pursue crusade - but that you haven't first exhausted every peaceful alternative.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands:\n\n\"Christ could have called down legions of angels to force conversion.

          "text": "**Context from the documents:**\n- Date: May 15, 1430\n- Juan has just rejoined his pilgrimage party after confronting the Infantes\n- The party includes Captain Fernán, 10 royal guards (in good equipment), Fray Hernando, 4 servants, 1 secretary (~30 people total)\n- They're traveling north from near Valladolid to Santiago\n- Infante Juan has been removed from council and is openly hostile\n- A diplomatic letter has been sent to Alfonso V of Aragon\n\n**Distance and Route:**\nSantiago de Compostela is in Galicia, northwest Castile. From Valladolid area, this is roughly 300-350 miles. In medieval times, this would take approximately 2-3 weeks of travel.\n\n**Factors Supporting Success:**\n1. **Within his own kingdom** - This is Castilian territory\n2. **Royal party** - 10 well-equipped guards, clearly marked as king's entourage\n3. **Pilgrimage route** - Santiago is major pilgrimage destination, well-traveled path\n4. **Spring season** - Good weather for travel (May)\n5. **Recent royal authority demonstration** - Just showed strength against Infantes\n6. **Popular pilgrimage** - Religious cover is believable and respected\n7. **Professional leadership** - Captain Fernán is competent\n8. **Early in crisis** - Infante Juan was just removed; he hasn't had time to organize opposition\n\n**Factors Creating Risk:**\n1. **Infante Juan's hostility** - He was just publicly humiliated and removed\n2. **Infantes have estates and allies in Castile** - Could potentially intercept\n3. **Travel always has risks** - Bandits, accidents, illness, weather\n4. **Political tensions** - Some nobles might see opportunity\n\n5. **King traveling away from capital** - Potential perception of vulnerability\n\nI see the political landscape is complex. The king's absence could be interpreted as weakness, but the timing works in his favor. Infante Juan is still reeling from his recent defeat and lacks immediate capacity to mount a serious challenge. The religious nature of the journey provides additional protection, making any potential interference politically dangerous. Travel risks exist, but the well-equipped royal party and established pilgrimage route offer significant safeguards.\n\nThe journey appears strategically sound, with minimal political threat at this early stage. Routine travel challenges are the primary concern, not organized opposition. The route's religious significance and the king's preparedness suggest a high probability of successful passage.\n\nChapter 3: The Road to Santiago\n\nThe Journey North\n\nDate: May 15, 1430\nLocation: Northern Castile, departed from near Valladolid\nDestination: Santiago de Compostela, Galicia\nDistance: Approximately 300-350 miles\nExpected Duration: 2-3 weeks\n\nAction Probability Assessment\n\nYour Proposed Action: Travel with your pilgrimage party through Castile to Santiago de Compostela\n\nMy Assessment: HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS\n\nFactors Supporting Success:\n\nRoyal Authority in Own Territory: You are traveling through your own kingdom with clear royal identification. Local authorities, towns, and nobles along the route have every reason to facilitate a royal pilgrimage.\n\nWell-Established Pilgrimage Route: The Camino de Santiago is one of Christendom's most important pilgrimage routes. The infrastructure exists - monasteries, hospices, bridges, and roads maintained specifically for pilgrims.\n\nAdequate Security: Captain Fernán commands 10 experienced royal guards in new equipment. This is sufficient to deter common bandits and command respect at every stop.\n\nFavorable Season: Early May offers good traveling weather - not too hot, roads dry from winter, plenty of daylight.\n\nReligious Protection: Attacking pilgrims, especially royal pilgrims, would be scandalous. The religious nature of your journey provides significant social protection.\n\nTiming: This is immediately after the confrontation. Infante Juan, though hostile, has had no time to organize opposition. He's still reeling from public humiliation and removal from the council.\n\nRecent Display of Strength: Your dramatic return and successful confrontation demonstrated that you're not easily manipulated. Potential troublemakers would think twice.\n\nPotential Risks (but manageable):\n\nNormal Travel Hazards: Weather changes, illness, accidents, minor banditry - the usual dangers of medieval travel.\n\nLocal Tensions: Some areas might have noble feuds or local conflicts, but these are routine challenges that experienced travelers can navigate.\n\nInfantes' Allies: While the Infantes have estates and supporters in Castile, organizing interception would require time and coordination they don't yet have.\n\nDistance from Capital: Some might view your absence as opportunity, but this is inherent to the pilgrimage plan you've already committed to.\n\nHistorical Context:\n\nRoyal pilgrimages were common and generally respected. The Santiago route was well-policed by local authorities who benefited from pilgrim traffic. Major incidents on such journeys were rare and noteworthy precisely because they violated strong social and religious norms.\n\nPlease roll your dice and tell me the result category:\n\nGreat Success\n\nSuccess\n\nFailure\n\nCatastrophic Failure\n\nBased on your roll, I will describe how the journey unfolds."

Additional benefits could include:\n   - Positive encounters that strengthen Juan's position\n   - Gathering useful intelligence along the way\n   - Building rapport with the pilgrimage party\n   - Positive reception from towns and common people\n   - Maybe discovering something useful about the realm\n   - Strengthening relationships with companions\n   - Perhaps a noble or important figure joins them\n   - Good intelligence from the cabinet members working in his absence\n\nGiven this is a pilgrimage and Juan has been learning about his realm, I think the \"great success\" should involve:\n- Safe, swift arrival\n- Positive public reception that demonstrates growing popular support\n- Useful intelligence or connections made along the way\n- Deepening bonds with key companions (Fray Hernando, Captain Fernán)\n- Perhaps learning something important about the common people's view\n- Maybe a useful encounter with someone who becomes an ally\n\nLet me write this as an immersive journey with multiple benefits that set Juan up well for the Rome portion of his journey.\n\nChapter 3: The Road to Santiago (Continued)\n\nThe Journey North - Great Success\n\nMay 15 - June 2, 1430\n\nWeek One: Through the Heartland\n\nYour pilgrimage party moves steadily northwest from Valladolid, following the ancient pilgrim routes through the Castilian heartland. What begins as a necessary journey transforms into something more - a revelation about the kingdom you rule.\n\nDay 3: Palencia\n\nThe first major town receives you with unexpected warmth. When word spreads that the King himself travels as a humble pilgrim, crowds gather. Not the calculated gatherings of nobles, but genuine people - merchants, craftsmen, farmers from surrounding villages.\n\nAn elderly woman pushes through, falling to her knees: \"Bless us, Your Majesty! Bless us as you go to pray for our souls at Santiago!\"\n\nYou're uncertain how to respond. Fray Hernando whispers: \"Touch her head, say you will pray for her at the shrine.\"\n\nYou do so, and the crowd erupts in appreciation. More people press forward - not demanding, but hopeful. They see you as their king, yes, but also as their intercessor with God. The dual nature of kingship has never felt more tangible.\n\nThat evening, the Bishop of Palencia hosts you. Over dinner, he confides: \"Your Majesty, the common people suffer much from noble feuds. Lords raid each other's lands, and it is the farmers who lose their crops, their sons, their livestock. They hope you will bring order.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán adds quietly: \"The guards noticed it too, Majesty. People asking when you'll rein in the nobles. They don't understand the politics - they just know things were better under your father.\"\n\nInsight gained: The common people are your potential base of support, but they need protection from noble chaos.\n\nDays 4-6: Across the Douro\n\nThe route takes you through fertile valleys where spring planting is underway. At each village, your party stops briefly. You insist on speaking with local priests and aldermen, asking about conditions.\n\nA pattern emerges:\n\nTaxes are irregular and often excessive when nobles collect them\n\nJustice is scarce - disputes fester for years waiting for traveling judges\n\nTrade is hampered by local tolls and \"customs\" that various lords impose\n\nBut people are industrious, faithful, and surprisingly hopeful\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval, traveling with you, remarks: \"Your Majesty, you're building something here. Every person who sees you, speaks with you - they'll remember. They'll tell their neighbors. 'The young king stopped in our village.' It matters.\"\n\nFray Hernando observes you carefully during these encounters. One evening, he asks: \"You genuinely care for these people, don't you?\"\n\n\"They're my people, Father. Not the nobles' subjects to be squeezed. Mine to protect.\" You pause. \"Is that pride speaking, or duty?\"\n\n\"Both, I think. But duty informed by genuine care is no sin.\"\n\nDays 7-9: The Mountains of León\n\nThe terrain becomes more challenging as you cross into the Kingdom of León. Here, the pilgrimage route enters mountainous country, and you encounter other pilgrims - dozens of groups heading to Santiago from across Christendom.\n\nA French merchant recognizes your royal party despite your modest presentation: \"Mon Dieu! It is the King of Castile himself! Walking like a common pilgrim!\"\n\nWord spreads among the pilgrim groups. That night at a monastery hospice, foreign pilgrims seek you out:\n\nGermans who praise your piety\n\nItalians who ask about trade routes\n\nPortuguese who speak of King João's respect for fellow monarchs who honor God\n\nAn English knight who fought in France, now seeking redemption\n\nThe English knight, Sir Thomas Beaumont, requests private audience. He's weathered, perhaps forty, with a soldier's bearing.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I've heard whispers even on the pilgrimage road. Men speak of troubles in Castile - ambitious princes, plots, divisions. If you seek loyal swords unburdened by local politics...\" He lets it hang.\n\nCaptain Fernán later advises: \"Foreign knights can be valuable, Majesty. No local allegiances, no family ties to constrain them. Though they're expensive.\"\n\nOpportunity identified: Foreign mercenaries and knights might provide politically neutral military force.\n\nDay 10: León Cathedral\n\nThe great cathedral city of León welcomes you with full ceremony. The Bishop, a stout man of sixty, is politically astute:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I rejoice at your pilgrimage. But I confess concern - the Infantes have sent letters suggesting the realm is unsettled. They paint your journey as... impulsive.\"\n\nYou expected this. \"My lord Bishop, I removed Infante Juan from the regency council for plotting to make it permanent while I still stood in the palace. His brother remains on the council. Does that sound impulsive, or decisive?\"\n\nThe Bishop's eyes widen. \"Ah. That explains much. They described it differently in their letters.\"\n\n\"I'm certain they did.\"\n\nHe smiles slowly. \"Then let me write my own letters, Majesty. The truth should circulate as widely as their version.\"\n\nAlliance gained: The Bishop of León will counter the Infantes' narrative among church hierarchy.\n\nWeek Two: Into Galicia\n\nDays 11-14: The Galician Highlands\n\nThe final approach to Santiago takes you through wild, beautiful country. Rain comes frequently - the famous Galician weather - but your party's spirits remain high.\n\nYou notice something: your guards have formed genuine camaraderie with you. Not just duty, but loyalty born of shared hardship. They've seen you ride through rain, sleep in common hospices, speak humbly with peasants. You're not just a distant king anymore.\n\nSergeant García, riding beside you through a downpour: \"Majesty, remember you asked us about real combat? About what makes men fight?\"\n\n\"I remember.\"\n\n\"This, sire. This is part of it. Shared misery, shared purpose. We'll follow you because we've walked this road with you.\"\n\nOne evening, you work with Captain Fernán on combat skills. He's impressed: \"You've continued practicing, Majesty. You move better than a month ago. Not expert yet, but competent. That's something.\"\n\nFray Hernando has been quieter this week, observing. Finally, he speaks: \"Your Majesty, I've watched you with the common people. You listen to them. Truly listen, not just perform listening. That's rare in kings.\"\n\n\"Should I not listen to my subjects?\"\n\n\"You should. Many don't. They think kingship means telling others what to do. You're learning it also means understanding what needs doing.\"\n\nDays 15-17: Approaching Santiago\n\nThe density of pilgrims increases dramatically as you near the holy city. Thousands are converging for the spring pilgrimage season. Your party merges into the great flow of humanity.\n\nAt the final monastery before Santiago, you meet someone unexpected:\n\nDon Fernando de Guzmán, a bishop from Seville, about 50 years old. He recognizes you immediately despite your modest appearance.\n\n\"Your Majesty! I did not expect to encounter you here!\" He's traveling with his own small party, returning from Santiago.\n\nOver dinner, he speaks frankly: \"Sire, I bring news from Seville. The city prepares for your Royal Council in November. But there are concerns - the Infantes have allies there, particularly in the nobility. They're already positioning for that gathering.\"\n\n\"What do you counsel, my lord Bishop?\"\n\n\"Arrive early. Meet with city leaders privately before the formal council. Build support among the merchant guilds - they fear noble chaos more than anything. And...\" he hesitates.\n\n\"Speak freely.\"\n\n\"Consider bringing something dramatic to the council. A treaty, a victory, a reform - something that demonstrates you're not just another noble in a crown, but a king with vision.\"\n\nStrategic intelligence gained: Advance warning about Seville politics and tactical advice for the November council.\n\nDay 18: Santiago de Compostela\n\nJune 2, 1430\n\nYou crest the final hill and see it: the spires of the great cathedral rising above the ancient city. Bells ring across Santiago as thousands of pilgrims pour into the city.\n\nYour party enters through the Francigena Gate with the great pilgrim crowd. For a moment, you're just another soul seeking Santiago's blessing - anonymous in the mass of humanity.\n\nThen someone shouts: \"¡El Rey! ¡Es el Rey!\" (The King! It's the King!)\n\nThe crowd parts. People fall to their knees. The cathedral bells intensify their ringing.\n\nThe Archbishop of Santiago, Don Lope de Mendoza (a distant relative of your advisor Íñigo), emerges in full regalia with cathedral canons and clergy.\n\n\"Your Majesty! All of Christendom honors you! A king who walks humbly as a pilgrim to our blessed shrine!\"\n\nThe next hours are a blur of ceremony:\n\nEntry procession through cheering crowds\n\nHigh Mass at the cathedral\n\nYour prayers at the tomb of Saint James\n\nTe Deum sung by the cathedral choir\n\nPublic blessing before thousands\n\nBut the most meaningful moment comes later, in quiet prayer before the silver reliquary containing the apostle's remains.\n\nKneeling alone (Fray Hernando nearby but silent), you pray genuinely:\n\n\"Saint James, you walked with Christ and carried His word to this far shore. I am young, uncertain, and walk a path full of dangers. Grant me wisdom to know God's will from my own ambition. Grant me courage to do what must be done. And if I fail - if I lead my kingdom to ruin through pride or foolishness - may God grant Castile a better king than I.\"\n\nThe silver and gold of the shrine gleam in candlelight. You feel... not a voice or vision, but a profound settling. Not certainty, but acceptance of uncertainty. Not answers, but peace with the questions.\n\nFray Hernando helps you to your feet. \"What did you feel, Majesty?\"\n\n\"That whatever happens, I must try. And that God knows I am trying.\"\n\nHe nods. \"That may be the truest prayer a king can offer.\"\n\nThe Benefits of Great Success\n\nYour journey to Santiago has yielded significant advantages:\n\n1. Popular Support Strengthened\nThroughout Castile and León, thousands have seen their king traveling humbly as a pilgrim, stopping in villages, listening to common concerns. Stories spread faster than you traveled - \"The young king cares for us.\"\n\n2. Church Alliances Formed\n\nBishop of Palencia sympathetic to your cause\n\nBishop of León actively countering Infantes' narrative\n\nBishop Fernando de Guzmán of Seville providing strategic intelligence\n\nArchbishop of Santiago has blessed your pilgrimage publicly\n\n3. Intelligence Gathered\nYou now understand:\n\nThe common people's main grievances (noble chaos, irregular justice, excessive tolls)\n\nThe Infantes are circulating their version of events\n\nSeville politics require early attention before November council\n\nForeign knights are available if you need politically neutral military force\n\n4. Personal Bonds Strengthened\n\nYour royal guards have developed genuine loyalty through shared hardship\n\nCaptain Fernán sees you as a competent student and worthy commander\n\nFray Hernando has observed your genuine care for subjects\n\nYour pilgrimage party is now a cohesive unit\n\n5. Strategic Position in Santiago\nYou're now in position to:\n\nRest for a few days while finalizing Rome plans\n\nMaintain your \"pilgrimage\" cover story\n\nDepart from Galicia (far from Valladolid's politics) for the secret journey to Rome\n\nHave fulfilled your stated pilgrimage goal, giving legitimacy to whatever you do next\n\n6. Unexpected Opportunity\nSir Thomas Beaumont, the English knight, has indirectly offered his services - foreign military expertise without local political complications.\n\nEvening in Santiago - June 2, 1430\n\nThe Archbishop has housed you in the cathedral's finest guest quarters. Your party gathers for dinner - a private meal after the day's public ceremonies.\n\nThe mood is celebratory but also expectant. Everyone knows Santiago was only the first destination. The real journey lies ahead.\n\nCaptain Fernán raises a cup: \"To His Majesty - who kept pace with his guards through three hundred miles of Castile!\"\n\nThe guards cheer. Even Fray Hernando smiles.\n\nYou stand, cup in hand. \"My friends, we have walked far together. But I must be honest with you now about where we walk next.\"\n\nThe room quiets. They know something significant is coming.\n\nHow do you wish to proceed, Your Majesty?\n\nDo you:\n\nReveal the full Rome plan to the entire party now?\n\nSpeak privately with key individuals first (Captain Fernán, Fray Hernando) before broader announcement?\n\nMaintain the pilgrimage fiction a bit longer while you finalize Rome logistics?\n\nSomething else entirely?\n\nWhat are your orders?"

          "text": "Juan is pulling aside Captain Fernán and Fray Hernando to reveal the Rome plan and ask the Captain to arrange ship passage. This is a private conversation between the three of them.\n\nI should:\n1. Have them react realistically to this revelation\n2. Address the practical logistics of getting a ship from Santiago/Galicia to Rome\n3. Discuss timeline and feasibility\n4. Have them offer counsel on the approach\n\nCaptain Fernán is a practical military man - he'll think about security, logistics, costs, and practicality.\n\nFray Hernando already knows about Rome from confession, but this is the first he's hearing that they're leaving immediately and that the Captain is being brought in.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Santiago/Galicia has ports (A Coruña, etc.)\n- Sea route from Galicia to Rome would go around Iberian peninsula, through Strait of Gibraltar, across Mediterranean\n- This is a LONG sea journey - 2000+ miles\n- Alternative would be overland through France to Italian ports, then shorter sea journey\n- Or land route all the way (even longer)\n- Timeline: It's early June. Council is November 8. That's about 5 months.\n- Sea journey could take 3-4 weeks one way in good conditions, longer with bad weather/stops\n- Need time in Rome for diplomacy\n- Need return journey time\n- Should work timeline-wise but will be tight\n\nLet me have them discuss these practical matters realistically.\n\nPrivate Counsel - Evening, June 2, 1430\n\nYou guide Captain Fernán and Fray Hernando to a small private chamber off the main guest quarters. The noise of the celebration fades as you close the heavy door.\n\nThe Captain reads your expression immediately. \"This is about what comes next, Majesty.\"\n\n\"Yes. Sit, both of you.\"\n\nFray Hernando settles on a simple bench, his face carefully neutral. He already knows, of course, from confession - but he cannot reveal that.\n\nYou stand before them both. \"Our next destination is Rome. Captain, I need you to secure us passage by ship - there and back. My intention is to meet Pope Martin V personally, introduce myself, and seek his blessing. Ideally, obtain a crusade bull for Granada. We must return to Seville in time for the Royal Council on November eighth.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán's Reaction\n\nThe Captain's eyebrows rise, but he doesn't look shocked - more like pieces are clicking into place.\n\n\"Rome.\" He's quiet for a moment, thinking through logistics. \"That explains why you chose Galicia for the pilgrimage. We're positioned on the Atlantic coast, away from the Infantes' strongest territories.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nHe stands, begins pacing - his habit when working through military problems. \"Let me think through this, Majesty. Sea route from Galician ports... we'd sail south along the Portuguese coast, through the Strait of Gibraltar, then east across the Mediterranean to Rome. Perhaps two thousand miles by sea, maybe more depending on the route.\"\n\n\"Can it be done?\"\n\n\"In terms of distance and time? Yes. It's June now, council is November eighth. That's five months. Figure three to four weeks for the voyage if we have favorable winds and weather - could be six weeks or more if we don't. Same for the return. Time in Rome for your diplomacy... it's tight, but possible.\"\n\nHe pauses, rubbing his jaw. \"The complications are different though, Majesty.\"\n\n\"Explain.\"\n\nThe Captain's Concerns\n\n\"First, cost. Chartering a ship for this journey won't be cheap - we're talking several thousand maravedís, possibly ten thousand or more for a vessel capable of this voyage with proper security. Do we have funds?\"\n\nYou nod. \"I brought sufficient treasury access. Cost is not the primary concern.\"\n\n\"Second, security. The Mediterranean has pirates - Barbary corsairs especially, but also others. We'd need a well-armed merchant vessel or arrange for naval escort. The Genoese and Venetians run these routes regularly; they know the dangers.\"\n\n\"Your recommendation?\"\n\n\"Find a Genoese merchant ship making the run to Italian ports. They're well-armed, experienced, and their presence alone deters most pirates. Costs more, but much safer than hiring some Portuguese captain with a fishing boat.\"\n\nHe continues, warming to the problem: \"Third, secrecy versus practicality. You wanted this quiet, but chartering a major ship requires contracts, port authorities, cargo arrangements. People will know a significant party is sailing. We can obscure the exact identity - say we're a noble household on pilgrimage to Rome - but complete secrecy is impossible.\"\n\n\"That's acceptable. As long as word doesn't reach the Infantes before we're at sea.\"\n\n\"Which brings me to fourth: the overland alternative.\"\n\nThe Overland Option\n\nCaptain Fernán stops pacing, faces you directly. \"Majesty, we could travel overland through France to the Italian ports - Marseille or Genoa - then take a much shorter sea voyage to Rome. Cuts the water travel significantly.\"\n\n\"But adds weeks on horseback.\"\n\n\"Yes, but consider the advantages: more control over our route, easier to maintain low profile, can stop at important cities and monasteries - build relationships with French church hierarchy. And frankly, I trust roads more than I trust the Mediterranean in summer.\"\n\nHe sees your skepticism. \"I'm a soldier, Majesty. I've crossed the Strait of Gibraltar once. Spent three days vomiting over the rail while Moorish pirates eyed our transport. I know my business on land; the sea is... less certain.\"\n\nFray Hernando Speaks\n\nThe monk has been listening quietly. Now he leans forward:\n\n\"Your Majesty, may I offer a spiritual perspective?\"\n\n\"Please.\"\n\n\"The sea route is faster but more dangerous - trusting to winds, weather, and providence. The land route is slower but more deliberate - following the ancient paths of pilgrims and missionaries. Both have merit.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"But I confess, the Captain's point about French church connections interests me. The Pope will ask who supports you, who vouches for you. Arriving with letters from French bishops and abbots, having stopped at Cluny or other great monasteries...\" He lets it hang.\n\n\"You think the Pope needs convincing that I'm legitimate?\"\n\n\"Your Majesty, you are eighteen years old, unknown in Rome, arriving from a kingdom the papal curia considers distant and unstable. Yes, I think building your credibility along the way would be wise. The Pope receives many petitions. Why should he grant yours?\"\n\nIt's a sobering point.\n\nThe Captain's Practical Questions\n\nFernán sits back down. \"Majesty, regardless of route, I need to know: who comes with us?\"\n\n\"What do you suggest?\"\n\n\"Minimum party for credibility and security: You, me, Fray Hernando as chaplain, four to six of our best guards - men who kept your secret on the return to Valladolid, who've proven themselves. One secretary to handle correspondence. Perhaps ten to twelve people total.\"\n\n\"Not the entire pilgrimage party?\"\n\n\"The others can return to Castile with a cover story - you've gone deeper into contemplative retreat at a remote Galician monastery. Buys us time before people realize you've left the kingdom entirely. And frankly, Majesty, the fewer people who know the full truth, the better.\"\n\nHe leans forward. \"But there's another question: What do we do about that English knight, Sir Thomas Beaumont?\"\n\nYou'd almost forgotten about him. \"Why does he matter?\"\n\n\"Because he's a skilled foreign knight who approached you, Majesty. No Castilian ties, combat experience in France, seeking employment. If you want a few extra swords with no local politics attached, he and any companions he might have could be valuable. And hiring foreign knights for a pilgrimage to Rome? Perfectly normal. Adds to our cover.\"\n\nFray Hernando's Concern\n\nThe monk interjects: \"Captain, forgive me, but hiring warriors for a pilgrimage seems... contradictory.\"\n\n\"With respect, Father, pilgrims get attacked. Wealthy pilgrims especially. Armed escort is common sense, not contradiction.\"\n\nFray Hernando nods reluctantly. \"I suppose that's true.\"\n\nHe turns to you. \"Your Majesty, I have one other concern. The Pope is... politically sophisticated. Pope Martin V is no unworldly holy man. He's navigated schism, Council politics, and Italian power struggles. When you meet him, you cannot simply appear as a young king seeking a crusade bull.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You must offer him something. Not just ask for blessing, but present how granting your request serves the Church's interests. Why should Rome care about Granada when they have concerns closer to home - the Hussites in Bohemia, reconciling with Constantinople, managing Italian politics?\"\n\nThe monk is more politically astute than you expected.\n\n\"What would you suggest?\"\n\n\"That we discuss strategy before we arrive. But broadly: emphasize how Granada's conversion serves broader Christian unity, how successful crusade strengthens papal authority by demonstrating the Pope can still summon Christendom to holy war, how your success makes you a strong and grateful ally in Iberia.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán grunts approval. \"The Father makes sense. Never ask for favor without explaining what's in it for them.\"\n\nThe Decision Point\n\nBoth men look at you expectantly.\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"So, Majesty, I need clear orders:\n\nRoute: Sea all the way, or overland through France then short sea voyage?\n\nParty Size: Just core group of 10-12, or larger?\n\nThe English Knight: Hire Sir Thomas Beaumont and any companions, or not?\n\nTiming: Depart as soon as ship/arrangements are made, or take a few days to rest and plan?\n\nCover Story: What do we tell the rest of the pilgrimage party who aren't coming?\"\n\nHe pulls out a small notebook. \"Give me the orders, and I'll start making arrangements. Santiago's ports are active - I can have us at sea or on the road within three to five days if we move quickly.\"\n\nFray Hernando adds quietly: \"And Your Majesty, one more thing. When we meet the Pope, who does he see? The humble pilgrim who prayed at Santiago? The determined young king who removed a traitor from his council? The strategic leader planning a crusade? You must decide what face to present.\"\n\nBoth men wait for your decisions.\n\nWhat are your orders, Your Majesty?"

          "text": "**Sea Route (All Water):**\n- Santiago/Galician port → down Portuguese coast → through Strait of Gibraltar → across Mediterranean to Rome\n- Distance: roughly 2,000+ miles by sea\n- With favorable winds: 3-4 weeks\n- With unfavorable conditions: 5-6 weeks or more\n- Return: same timing\n\n**Overland Route:**\n- Santiago → across northern Spain → through Pyrenees → across southern France → to Marseille or Genoa → short sea voyage to Rome\n- Distance: perhaps 800-900 miles overland, then 400-500 miles by sea\n- On horseback with good roads: 25-30 miles per day average\n- So 800 miles / 25 miles per day = 32 days, roughly a month\n- Then 1-2 weeks by sea from Marseille/Genoa to Rome\n- Total: 6-7 weeks one way\n\nSo the overland route would add about 2-3 weeks each direction compared to the best-case sea route, but might be comparable to the worst-case sea route. The key difference is predictability vs. uncertainty.\n\nCaptain Fernán should lay this out clearly, with his military mind for logistics and his preference for the more controllable land route showing through.\n\nCaptain Fernán's Route Analysis\n\nThe Captain pulls his chair closer, spreading his hands as if laying out a map on the table between you.\n\n\"Good question, Majesty. Let me break down both routes with realistic timing.\"\n\nThe All-Sea Route\n\n\"From a Galician port - likely A Coruña, it's the major port here - we sail south along the Portuguese coast, through the Strait of Gibraltar, then east across the Mediterranean to Ostia or Civitavecchia, Rome's ports.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\"Distance: Roughly two thousand miles, possibly more depending on the exact route and whether we hug the coast or sail more direct.\n\nBest Case: Three to four weeks with steady favorable winds and good weather. I've heard of merchant vessels making similar journeys in that time during summer.\n\nRealistic Case: Four to five weeks. Weather changes, contrary winds, need to put in at ports for water and supplies.\n\nWorst Case: Six weeks or more. Summer storms in the Mediterranean, calms where you sit for days waiting for wind, pirates forcing detours, or ship damage requiring repairs.\n\nReturn Journey: Same timing, same variables.\"\n\nHe leans back. \"So we're looking at six to ten weeks total for both voyages, possibly twelve if luck runs against us. And Majesty, the sea is unpredictable. I cannot guarantee any of these times.\"\n\nThe Overland Route\n\n\"Now, the overland alternative. We ride east from Santiago, across northern Castile and Aragon, through the Pyrenees into southern France, then southeast to either Marseille or Genoa for a much shorter sea voyage to Rome.\"\n\nHis eyes brighten slightly - this is clearly his preference.\n\n\"Overland Distance: Perhaps eight hundred to nine hundred miles, depending on exact route.\n\nDaily Travel Rate: With good horses, decent roads, and your party in good condition - which we are after three weeks on pilgrimage - we can average twenty-five to thirty miles per day. Some days more, some less, but that's a sustainable pace.\n\nCalculation: Nine hundred miles divided by twenty-five miles per day equals thirty-six days. Call it five to six weeks of riding.\n\nSea Portion: From Marseille to Rome is perhaps four hundred miles. From Genoa, similar or slightly longer. That's one to two weeks by sea, three at most if conditions are poor. But it's coastal sailing, much safer than crossing the open Mediterranean.\n\nTotal One Way: Six to seven weeks, possibly eight in worst case.\n\nReturn Journey: Same timing.\"\n\nThe Comparison\n\nFray Hernando has been following carefully. \"So the overland route takes perhaps two to three weeks longer each way?\"\n\n\"In the best case for the sea route, yes Father. But here's the critical point:\" The Captain holds up a finger. \"The sea route's timing is uncertain. We might make it in three weeks with perfect wind. Or we might sit becalmed for a week, then hit storms, then face pirates. I cannot control it.\n\nThe overland route takes longer, but it's predictable. I know we can cover twenty-five miles a day. I know where the roads go, where the towns are, where we can rest. Short of serious illness or injury, I can get you there in six weeks.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"From a military perspective, Majesty, I prefer the plan I can control over the faster plan I cannot.\"\n\nThe Math for Your Schedule\n\nYou interject: \"Let's be specific about the calendar. Today is June second. The Royal Council convenes in Seville on November eighth. That's...\"\n\n\"Five months and six days,\" Fray Hernando supplies quickly. \"Twenty-three weeks.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán nods. \"Let's work backwards from November eighth:\n\nYou need to be in Seville by: Early November at latest, ideally late October to prepare.\n\nTravel time from Rome to Seville: Whether we return by sea or land, figure six to eight weeks to be safe. So you need to leave Rome by early to mid-September.\n\nTime in Rome for your diplomacy: You'll need at least two weeks, possibly a month, to secure papal audience, conduct negotiations, allow for delays in the papal schedule. Pope Martin V is a busy man. So you should arrive in Rome by mid-August at latest, early August to be comfortable.\n\nThat means departing Santiago: Early to mid-June if we sail. Mid-June at latest if we ride overland.\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"Majesty, by either route, we have time. It's tight, but doable. The question is which risks you prefer: the unpredictability of the sea, or the longer but more certain overland journey.\"\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"Your Majesty, the Captain mentioned building church connections through France. Let me be more specific about that value.\"\n\n\"Please.\"\n\n\"The overland route takes us through Navarre - your Infante Juan's kingdom - but we can skirt the main cities. Then into France - we could stop at Toulouse, important see. Then Avignon.\"\n\nYou look up sharply. \"Avignon? The old papal seat?\"\n\n\"Yes, Majesty. The schism ended only eleven years ago. Avignon still has immense prestige in the Church, and many cardinals and church officials there remember when it was the papal capital. An audience with the Archbishop of Avignon, prayers at the papal palace chapel, letters of introduction to Rome...\" He spreads his hands. \"It builds your credibility as a true pilgrim-king, not just a political petitioner.\"\n\n\"Plus Cluny Abbey,\" the monk continues, \"one of the greatest monasteries in Christendom. And depending on route, possibly Lyon, Marseille - each with its own bishop who could vouch for you to Rome.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán grunts. \"The Father makes tactical sense. Arriving in Rome with a dozen letters from French church hierarchy carries weight.\"\n\nThe Trade-Offs Summarized\n\nThe Captain ticks off on his fingers:\n\n\"Sea Route:\n\nFaster: Best case three to four weeks, possibly as good as five weeks\n\nMore dangerous: Pirates, storms, seasickness, ship damage\n\nLess control: Weather and wind decide our schedule\n\nDirect: No intermediate stops, no complications with French politics\n\nCheaper: One ship charter versus weeks of lodging and horses through France\n\nOverland Route:\n\nSlower: Six to seven weeks, possibly eight\n\nSafer: Dangers we can see and respond to\n\nMore control: Predictable daily progress\n\nPolitically valuable: Build French church connections\n\nMore expensive: Weeks of lodging, horse maintenance, food for larger party over longer time\"\n\nHe sits back. \"Either route gets you to Rome with time for your business and return before November. The question is: do you value speed and cost, or predictability and political groundwork?\"\n\nFray Hernando adds quietly: \"And there's one more consideration, Your Majesty. Which journey feels right? You came to Santiago on foot as a pilgrim. Continuing to Rome by the ancient routes versus sailing...\" He shrugs gently. \"It may seem a small thing, but the story you tell matters. Did the young King Juan sail to Rome as expedience dictated? Or did he walk the pilgrim roads as kings once did?\"\n\nBoth men look at you, awaiting your decision.\n\nYour Majesty, which route do you choose?"

The Captain especially would appreciate the tactical flexibility (deciding on Genoa sea vs continuing overland) and the asymmetric approach (different routes for different needs).\n\nLet me have them react positively with some practical details about the return sea journey.\n\nThe Strategic Choice\n\nCaptain Fernán's eyes light up immediately. \"Now that's thinking like a commander, Majesty.\"\n\nHe stands, animated. \"Yes. Absolutely yes. Overland through France to Rome - we build your credibility, we control our pace, we arrive with proper letters of introduction. Then sea from Rome directly to Seville...\" He's nodding vigorously.\n\nFray Hernando looks impressed as well. \"Different routes for different purposes. Wisdom, Your Majesty.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán's Assessment\n\n\"Let me confirm the return voyage, Majesty. Rome's ports to Seville...\"\n\nHe thinks, calculating distances mentally. \"Ostia or Civitavecchia west across the Mediterranean, past Sardinia, through the Strait of Gibraltar, then up the Guadalquivir River to Seville. That's perhaps twelve hundred to fourteen hundred miles by sea. Maybe half the distance of the full Atlantic route.\"\n\n\"Time estimate?\"\n\n\"Two to three weeks with decent wind and weather. Even if we hit problems, four weeks at most. And it's mostly coastal - we're never far from ports if we need shelter or repairs. Much less dangerous than the open Atlantic crossing.\"\n\nHe grins. \"And you arrive directly in Seville, ready for your council. No overland journey from Galicia, no advance warning to your opponents that you're returning. Just... appear in Seville with a papal crusade bull.\"\n\n\"The theatrical impact alone would be worth it,\" Fray Hernando murmurs.\n\nThe Revised Timeline\n\nCaptain Fernán pulls out his notebook again, recalculating:\n\n\"Today: June 2nd\n\nDepart Santiago: Within three to five days, say June 5th to 7th\n\nArrive Rome via France: Six to seven weeks of travel puts us in Rome by late July, possibly early August\n\nTime in Rome: Two to four weeks for papal audiences, negotiations, obtaining the bull - through August and into early September\n\nDepart Rome by Sea: Early to mid-September\n\nArrive Seville: Late September to early October\n\nRoyal Council: November 8th\"\n\nHe looks up, satisfied. \"Majesty, this gives you a full month in Seville before the council. Time to meet with local nobles, the city guilds, Bishop Fernando who we met on the road. Time to prepare your presentation, coordinate with Don Álvaro on how things have developed in your absence. Time to control the narrative before the Infantes can react.\"\n\n\"And if things in Rome take longer than expected?\" you ask.\n\n\"We still have cushion. Even if we don't leave Rome until late September, we reach Seville by mid to late October. That's still two to three weeks before the council. Tight, but manageable.\"\n\nThe French Route Details\n\nFray Hernando leans forward. \"Your Majesty, if we're committing to the French route, let me suggest key stops:\n\nWeek One: Across northern Castile to Pamplona in Navarre. We must pass through Infante Juan's kingdom, but quickly and quietly.\n\nWeek Two: Cross the Pyrenees into France, reach Toulouse. Important archdiocese, worth a day or two for audience with the Archbishop.\n\nWeek Three-Four: Southeast to Avignon. This is crucial - the old papal seat. We must spend several days here, meet with church officials, pray at the papal palace, obtain letters for Rome.\n\nWeek Five: Continue to the coast - Marseille or press on to Genoa, depending on our schedule and your decision about the final leg.\n\nWeek Six-Seven: If we continue overland, through Italian territories to Rome. If we sail from Genoa, perhaps ten days to two weeks to Ostia.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"The journey itself becomes part of your credentials, Majesty. You can tell Pope Martin: 'I walked from Santiago through France, stopping at Avignon to honor the memory of the papal seat, seeking guidance from your archbishops and abbots.' It shows commitment beyond mere political maneuvering.\"\n\nPractical Arrangements\n\nCaptain Fernán shifts to logistics. \"For the overland journey, we need:\n\nHorses: Good coursers for the riding party, pack animals for supplies. I can arrange this in Santiago - we return the pilgrimage horses, acquire proper mounts for a long journey.\n\nParty Size: As discussed, ten to twelve people. Small enough to move quickly, large enough for security and credibility.\n\nFunds: The overland route costs more than straight sea voyage - lodging, food, horse maintenance over six weeks. But you mentioned having sufficient treasury access. I estimate... four to five thousand maravedís for the outbound journey, another three thousand for the sea return, plus extra for unexpected expenses. Say ten thousand maravedís total to be safe.\"\n\n\"That's acceptable,\" you confirm.\n\n\"Documents: We'll need safe-conduct letters. I can obtain these from the Archbishop of Santiago for passage through Castile and France. Your royal seal helps, but formal letters smooth the way at borders and in cities.\"\n\nHe taps his notebook. \"For the return sea voyage from Rome, I'll need to arrange that while we're in Rome. The Italian maritime republics - Genoa, Venice, Pisa - all run regular merchant traffic through the Strait to Iberia. Finding a ship won't be difficult, just a matter of negotiating passage.\"\n\nThe Flexibility Point\n\nThe Captain looks at you with respect. \"Majesty, I like that you're keeping options open on the final approach to Rome. Ride all the way, or take ship from Genoa - we can decide based on how the overland journey goes, how our schedule looks, what we learn along the way. That's good command thinking. Never commit to a plan so rigidly you can't adapt.\"\n\nFray Hernando smiles. \"The Captain approves of your strategy, Your Majesty. As do I. This plan serves multiple purposes - building your credentials, maintaining schedule flexibility, and creating dramatic impact for your return.\"\n\nNext Immediate Questions\n\nCaptain Fernán flips to a fresh page. \"So, remaining decisions before I begin arrangements:\n\nOne: Party composition. You, me, Fray Hernando definitely. Which guards? I recommend Sergeant García and Corporal Rodrigo - they kept your secret on the return from Medina del Campo, they're proven. Two to four more from our best men. That's six to eight fighters total, plus you. Then a secretary?\"\n\nHe pauses. \"And the English knight, Sir Thomas Beaumont. Do we approach him? Foreign knights joining a noble's journey to Rome is perfectly normal. Adds to our cover and gives us extra swords with no Castilian politics.\"\n\nTwo: \"Cover story for the rest of the pilgrimage party who aren't coming with us. What do we tell them? And when? Tell them tonight, or wait until the morning we depart?\"\n\nThree: \"Departure timing. I need three to four days to arrange horses, supplies, documents, and scout the route. That puts us leaving Santiago on June 5th or 6th. Does Your Majesty need more time here to rest, or are you ready to continue?\"\n\nFour: \"What do we tell the Archbishop of Santiago? He's housing us, he's a Mendoza. Does he learn the truth, or do we maintain the fiction of... what? An extended contemplative retreat? A private pilgrimage to French shrines?\"\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"And Your Majesty, one more question from me: How much of this do you wish to write to Don Álvaro? He should know your plans and timeline. But the message must travel back to Valladolid - is there risk of interception?\"\n\nBoth men await your decisions on these final practical matters before Captain Fernán begins making arrangements.\n\nYour orders, Majesty?"

          "text": "Captain Fernán would approve of the smaller party. Fray Hernando would have thoughts on the bishop letters question. Both would want to confirm a few final details before beginning preparations.\n\nThe Orders Received\n\nCaptain Fernán nods approvingly. \"A lean party moves fast. Understood, Majesty.\"\n\nFray Hernando looks relieved at your decision against deception. \"Honesty where possible is wise, Your Majesty. The truth has a way of emerging regardless.\"\n\nOn Castilian Bishop Letters\n\nYour question about Castilian bishops makes Fray Hernando sit up straighter. \"Your Majesty, an excellent question. The answer is: yes, but with nuance.\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\"The Archbishop of Toledo - Don Juan Martínez de Contreras - his letter would carry significant weight in Rome. Toledo is the Primate See of Spain, ancient and prestigious. A letter from Toledo vouching for you would matter greatly to Pope Martin.\"\n\n\"The problem,\" Captain Fernán interjects, \"is that the Archbishop is on your regency council. Writing to him reveals Rome to the council, and thus to Infante Enrique, and thus...\"\n\n\"To Infante Juan within hours,\" you finish. \"Yes, I see the problem.\"\n\nFray Hernando continues: \"However, other bishops can help. The Bishop of Palencia we met on the way here - sympathetic to you. The Bishop of León who offered to counter the Infantes' narrative. And here, the Archbishop of Santiago - Don Lope de Mendoza.\"\n\n\"Would their letters help in Rome?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Fray Hernando says firmly. \"Perhaps not as much as Toledo, but Castilian bishops carry weight. The Church is universal - a bishop's testimony about a king's character and faith matters, regardless of kingdom. And Spain's bishops are respected for learning and piety.\"\n\nHe leans forward. \"Here's what I suggest: We obtain letters from Santiago's Archbishop before we leave - he's housing you, has seen your pilgrimage firsthand, and is well-disposed. We can send messages to the Bishops of León and Palencia requesting letters to be forwarded to you in France - Avignon perhaps, or we arrange a meeting point.\"\n\n\"And Toledo?\"\n\n\"We avoid Toledo for now,\" the monk says carefully. \"Perhaps Don Álvaro can obtain a letter from the Archbishop through some indirect means, or we simply proceed without it. Better to lack one powerful letter than to reveal your destination prematurely.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán's Party Composition\n\n\"Majesty, for a lean, fast party, here's my recommendation:\n\nEight people total:\n\nYour Majesty\n\nMyself as commander and your guard captain\n\nFray Hernando as chaplain\n\nSergeant García, Corporal Rodrigo - your most proven men\n\nTwo more guards from our best - I'm thinking Martín and young Felipe, both solid riders and fighters\n\nOne secretary to handle correspondence - the young clerk Diego who's been with us, he's literate in Latin\n\nEight riders can cover thirty miles a day easily, more if we push. We're all experienced from the pilgrimage. Small enough to find lodging without difficulty, large enough to deter casual bandits.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"What about Sir Thomas Beaumont, the English knight? And any companions he might have?\"\n\n\"What's your counsel?\"\n\n\"Normally I'd say yes - extra swords, foreign credentials, good cover. But if we're being open about traveling to France, foreign knights are less necessary for deception. The question becomes: do we want his sword and experience? He's a veteran, fought in France under English command. Could be valuable. But it increases the party to perhaps ten or eleven if he has a companion or squire.\"\n\n\"Your recommendation?\"\n\nCaptain Fernán considers. \"My instinct says leave him. We're tight, experienced, and know each other. Adding unknown elements... I'd rather keep it to our proven men. But I'll follow your judgment, Majesty.\"\n\nFray Hernando on the Letters to Álvaro\n\n\"Your Majesty, regarding your letters to Don Álvaro - may I offer thoughts on content?\"\n\n\"Please.\"\n\n\"You said you'll write that you've reached Santiago and will travel east into France 'where God guides you.' That's truthful without revealing Rome specifically. Wise.\"\n\nHe taps his chin. \"I would suggest including:\n\nYour intention to seek letters from French bishops and possibly visit Avignon\n\nYour expected timeline - departure early June, return by October\n\nReassurance that this serves the realm's interests, not just personal devotion\n\nInstructions for Don Álvaro on how to manage inquiries about your whereabouts\"\n\n\"You're suggesting I not mention Rome explicitly even to Álvaro?\"\n\n\"That's for you to decide, Majesty. The question is: how secure are letters between here and Valladolid? They pass through many hands. If you trust the messenger completely and Álvaro's receipt of the letter is secure, then yes, tell him everything - he should know your full plans.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán adds: \"I can arrange a trusted royal courier. Someone who's ridden for your father, known to be discreet. The risk isn't zero, but it's manageable.\"\n\nThe Archbishop of Santiago Question\n\n\"And the Archbishop here,\" Fray Hernando continues, \"Don Lope de Mendoza. He's housing you, he's family to your advisor Íñigo López. What do we tell him?\"\n\nCaptain Fernán weighs in: \"He'll need to know something, Majesty. We're asking for letters of recommendation. 'To whom' is a question he'll ask. And when we depart heading east instead of back toward Castile, he'll notice.\"\n\n\"Do we trust him?\" you ask.\n\n\"He's Mendoza family,\" the Captain says. \"The Mendozas are... cautiously supportive of you, not openly hostile. They're watching which way the wind blows. But Don Lope here is churchman first, Mendoza second. He blessed your pilgrimage publicly and enthusiastically.\"\n\nFray Hernando nods. \"I would tell him, Your Majesty. Not necessarily the full plan tonight, but before we depart. Request his letter of recommendation for your continued pilgrimage 'toward the Holy See.' He'll understand. And having Santiago's Archbishop aware and supportive is valuable.\"\n\nConfirmation of the Plan\n\nCaptain Fernán stands, ready to begin work. \"So, to confirm, Your Majesty:\n\nParty: Eight people - you, me, Fray Hernando, four guards (García, Rodrigo, Martín, Felipe), secretary Diego. No English knight.\n\nRoute: Overland through France, visiting Toulouse, Avignon, possibly other important sees. Flexibility on whether we ride all the way to Rome or take ship from Genoa.\n\nReturn: Sea voyage from Rome directly to Seville, arriving late September or early October.\n\nLetters:\n\nObtain recommendation from Archbishop of Santiago before departure\n\nRequest letters from Bishops of León and Palencia to meet us in France\n\nAvoid involving Archbishop of Toledo\n\nSend letters to Don Álvaro via trusted courier - you'll decide how explicit to be about Rome\n\nOpenness: We're not hiding that we're traveling to France, but we're also not announcing Rome to the world. The pilgrimage continues, guided by faith, seeking wisdom from French church hierarchy.\n\nDeparture: June 5th or 6th, giving me three to four days to arrange horses, supplies, documents, and courier service.\n\nIs that correct, Majesty?\"\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"And I will begin drafting your letter to Don Álvaro, for your review and signature. Also prepare talking points for your conversation with the Archbishop of Santiago - requesting his letter and blessing for your continued journey.\"\n\nBoth men look at you, awaiting final confirmation.\n\nIs everything clear, Your Majesty? Any adjustments to the plan, or shall we begin preparations?"

          "text": "POSITIVE FACTORS:\n1. Well-established route - pilgrimage routes through France to Rome are ancient and well-traveled\n2. Summer travel season - June through August is ideal traveling weather\n3. Experienced party - they just completed 3 weeks of successful pilgrimage\n4. Adequate security - 6 guards plus English knight, total of ~10 people\n5. Royal authority and church letters - will have Archbishop of Santiago's letter, plus can collect more along the way\n6. Good planning - realistic timeline, flexible approach\n7. Adequate funds - 10,000 maravedís budgeted\n8. Captain Fernán's competence - proven military leader\n9. Peace in France - while Hundred Years War continues, summer 1430 is relatively stable period, Joan of Arc's recent victories have shifted momentum\n10. Church connections - Fray Hernando's knowledge and ability to arrange church hospitality\n\nPOTENTIAL RISKS:\n1. Distance - ~900 miles overland is substantial\n2. Border crossings - Navarre (Infante Juan's kingdom), then into France\n3. Hundred Years War context - France is war-torn, though major campaigns are in north\n4. Bandits - always a risk on medieval roads\n5. Illness - medieval travel hazards\n6. Political complications - various French territories have different loyalties\n7. The party might be recognized despite low profile\n8. Weather - could have unusual summer storms\n9. Horse injuries/problems - with 10 riders over 900 miles, some horse problems likely\n\nHowever, let me consider:\n- This is a well-traveled route (pilgrimage roads)\n- Summer 1430 is actually a relatively good time - Joan of Arc has changed French fortunes, there's more stability than there was in 1429\n\n- The group's strategic advantages outweigh potential risks\n- Multiple layers of protection and preparation increase chances of success\n\nI calculate a strong probability of successfully completing the journey. Their comprehensive preparation, religious credentials, and strategic approach provide robust safeguards against potential obstacles. The combination of experienced leadership, adequate resources, and carefully planned contingencies significantly mitigates travel risks inherent in medieval long-distance journeys.\n\nThe Journey to Rome - Action Assessment\n\nYour Final Decisions\n\nCaptain Fernán nods with satisfaction. \"The English knight - good. Extra sword, foreign credentials, and he came recommended by his service in France. I'll approach him tonight.\"\n\nFray Hernando agrees on avoiding Toledo: \"Wise, Your Majesty. We proceed with what we can obtain safely.\"\n\nThe preparations begin immediately.\n\nProbability Assessment: Journey from Santiago to Rome via France\n\nYour Proposed Action: Travel overland from Santiago de Compostela through northern Spain and France to Rome, visiting key church centers (Toulouse, Avignon) to gather letters of recommendation, with a party of 10 people, arriving in Rome by late July/early August.\n\nMy Assessment: HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS\n\nFactors Strongly Supporting Success:\n\n1. Well-Established Route\n\nThe pilgrimage roads through France to Rome are among the most traveled in Christendom\n\nInfrastructure exists: monasteries, hospices, bridges, maintained roads\n\nThousands make this journey annually; you're following proven paths\n\nLocal authorities along the route are accustomed to pilgrims and know how to facilitate them\n\n2. Ideal Timing\n\nSummer 1430 is good traveling season - warm, dry roads, long daylight\n\nYou're departing early June, giving maximum good weather window\n\nHarvest season not yet begun, so roads less crowded with commercial traffic\n\nFrench situation is relatively stable in summer 1430 following Joan of Arc's victories\n\n3. Excellent Party Composition\n\n10 experienced travelers just proven on 300-mile Santiago pilgrimage\n\nCaptain Fernán: competent military commander who knows overland travel\n\n6 proven guards plus English knight with French campaign experience\n\nFray Hernando: church connections and Latin literacy\n\nSecretary for correspondence\n\nEveryone mounted on good horses, not walking\n\n4. Adequate Resources\n\n10,000 maravedís budget is generous for this journey\n\nRoyal authority commands respect and access\n\nArchbishop of Santiago's letter provides church credentials\n\nLegitimate pilgrimage purpose provides social and religious protection\n\n5. Strategic Planning\n\nRealistic timeline with built-in flexibility\n\nMultiple route options if needed\n\nNot trying to maintain complete secrecy (which would be suspicious)\n\nStopping at major church centers serves both political and practical purposes\n\nCaptain Fernán can adapt to changing conditions\n\n6. Historical Precedent\n\nKings, nobles, and wealthy pilgrims make this journey regularly\n\nYour father Juan I traveled extensively\n\nNothing about this journey is unprecedented or unusual\n\nMedieval Europe has systems to handle exactly this kind of travel\n\n7. Political Protection\n\nYou're a crowned king on pilgrimage - attacking you would be scandalous\n\nChurch protection is powerful in this era\n\nFrench territories have no particular reason to oppose you\n\nEven passing through Navarre (Infante Juan's kingdom), open attack on pilgrimage would be politically unacceptable\n\n8. Sir Thomas Beaumont\n\nVeteran who fought in France knows the territory\n\nForeign knight adds legitimacy to \"noble pilgrimage\" cover\n\nNo Castilian political entanglements\n\nExtra experienced sword\n\nManageable Risks:\n\n1. Navarre Transit\n\nMust pass through Infante Juan's kingdom\n\nRisk: He could attempt to detain or delay you\n\nMitigation: Move quickly through, low profile, legitimate pilgrimage purpose makes detention difficult to justify\n\n2. Normal Travel Hazards\n\nIllness, accidents, horse injuries, weather\n\nRisk: Could delay or complicate journey\n\nMitigation: Summer travel, experienced party, adequate funds for contingencies, medical knowledge available through monasteries\n\n3. Bandits\n\nAlways a risk on medieval roads\n\nRisk: Robbery, injury, delay\n\nMitigation: 7 armed men plus you make unattractive target; pilgrimage roads are better patrolled; monasteries provide secure lodging\n\n4. French Political Complexity\n\nFrance is still in Hundred Years War (though Joan of Arc has shifted momentum)\n\nVarious territories have different loyalties (Burgundian vs. French crown)\n\nRisk: Getting caught in local conflicts or border complications\n\nMitigation: Summer 1430 is relatively quiet period; southern route avoids main war zones; church letters smooth border crossings; pilgrimage status is respected by all sides\n\n5. Recognition\n\nMight be recognized as King of Castile despite low profile\n\nRisk: Unwanted attention, demands for audiences, news reaching back to Castile\n\nMitigation: Not trying to hide completely; being recognized in France is less dangerous than in Castile; can claim extended pilgrimage if questioned\n\n6. Timeline Pressure\n\nMust reach Rome by late July/August for papal business\n\nRisk: Delays could compress time for papal diplomacy\n\nMitigation: 6-7 week timeline for 900 miles is conservative; can push to 30-35 miles/day if needed; flexibility built in\n\nWhy Not \"Certain Success\"?\n\nMedieval travel always has uncertainties (weather, illness, accidents)\n\nHuman factors (personality conflicts, morale issues over long journey)\n\nPolitical developments you can't foresee\n\nSmall chance of serious misfortune (major illness, severe injury, exceptional circumstances)\n\nBut these are normal risks of any substantial medieval journey, not specific reasons to doubt this plan.\n\nHistorical Context:\n\nIn 1430, this journey is routine for wealthy pilgrims and nobles. The routes are well-known, the infrastructure exists, and the political situation in France, while complex, is not actively hostile to Iberian pilgrims. Your party is well-prepared, well-funded, and has legitimate purpose.\n\nConclusion: HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS\n\nYour journey to Rome via France should succeed. The plan is sound, resources adequate, party capable, and route proven. You will face normal medieval travel challenges, but nothing suggests significant obstacles that would prevent reaching Rome.\n\nThe greater uncertainties lie not in the journey itself, but in what happens in Rome (papal diplomacy) and what develops in Castile during your absence. But getting there? That should work.\n\nPlease roll your dice and tell me the result category:\n\nGreat Success\n\nSuccess\n\nFailure\n\nCatastrophic Failure\n\nBased on your roll, I will narrate the journey through France to Rome, including specific events, encounters, and what you accomplish along the way."

Include the complications that prevent it from being a \"Great Success\" but show competent handling.\n\nTime period: Early June to late July/early August 1430 (about 7-8 weeks)\n\nChapter 3: The Road to Rome (Continued)\n\nPart II: Through France to the Holy See\n\nJune 5, 1430 - Morning, Santiago de Compostela\n\nThe Preparations Complete\n\nCaptain Fernán has worked miracles in three days. Ten horses stand ready in the cathedral courtyard - good coursers for riding, two pack animals for supplies. Your lean party of ten assembles:\n\nYourself, in practical traveling clothes, royal seal concealed but accessible\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso de Robles, commanding\n\nFray Hernando de Talavera, your confessor and chaplain\n\nSergeant García, Corporal Rodrigo, Martín, Felipe - your proven guards\n\nDiego, the young secretary, nervous but determined\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont, the English knight, accompanied by his squire Peter, a capable young man of twenty\n\nSir Thomas proved easy to recruit. When Captain Fernán approached him yesterday, the English knight's eyes lit up: \"Rome? With a young king who outmaneuvered traitors and walks as a pilgrim? My sword is yours, Your Majesty. No charge beyond provisions and the honor of the journey.\"\n\nHe's proven himself already - spent yesterday helping select horses, checking equipment, sharing knowledge of French roads from his military service.\n\nThe Archbishop's Blessing\n\nDon Lope de Mendoza, Archbishop of Santiago, meets you in his private chapel for a final conversation. You've been honest with him - not revealing every detail, but explaining you seek to visit French church centers and possibly continue toward Rome itself.\n\nHe's surprisingly unsurprised.\n\n\"Your Majesty, when a young king comes to Santiago and prays as you prayed - with such intensity, such genuine seeking - it was clear this was the beginning of a journey, not the end.\"\n\nHe hands you a sealed letter, written in elegant Latin. \"For any bishop, archbishop, or cardinal you encounter. It attests to your sincere faith, your humble pilgrimage, and my blessing on your continued journey. The seal of Santiago carries weight in Rome.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Your Grace.\"\n\n\"One more thing.\" He lowers his voice. \"I've written privately to my nephew Íñigo - your advisor. Told him you departed heading east, seeking deeper spiritual guidance. Let him read between those lines as he will. But I've given him nothing the Infantes could use against you.\"\n\nPolitical astuteness wrapped in ecclesiastical robes. The Mendozas are indeed careful players.\n\n\"And Your Majesty?\" He places a hand on your shoulder. \"Whatever you seek in Rome - whether crusade, blessing, or simply answers - remember that God works through the Church, yes, but also through you. A king who genuinely cares for his people, who walks humbly... that itself is rare and holy.\"\n\nThe Letters to Álvaro\n\nBefore departing, you finalize three letters that will be sent to Valladolid via Captain Fernán's trusted courier:\n\nFirst Letter (To be opened immediately):\n\nYou've reached Santiago safely\n\nContinuing pilgrimage \"where God guides\" - traveling east through France\n\nVisiting important church centers, seeking wisdom and letters of recommendation\n\nExpected return by October\n\nTrust Álvaro to manage affairs with the regency council\n\nWill send further updates when possible\n\nSecond Letter (More detailed, sealed):\n\nYour true destination: Rome, to seek papal audience\n\nGoal: crusade bull for Granada, papal endorsement of your rule\n\nRoute through Toulouse, Avignon, then to Rome\n\nReturn by sea directly to Seville\n\nInstructions on how to manage questions about your whereabouts\n\nWarning to watch the Infantes carefully\n\nThird Letter (Private cipher, for Álvaro's eyes only):\n\nFull strategic reasoning for Rome journey\n\nAssessment of regency council dynamics\n\nInstructions for the cabinet members\n\nYour expectations for what he should accomplish during your absence\n\nPersonal note of trust and friendship\n\nThe courier departs within the hour, racing back toward Castile.\n\nWeek One: Through Navarre - The Dangerous Crossing\n\nJune 6-8: Eastern Castile\n\nYour party rides hard through eastern Castile, covering thirty to thirty-five miles daily. The horses are fresh, the weather perfect, and everyone is in good spirits. You pass through Burgos briefly - just long enough to change horses and hear Mass - then press on toward Navarre.\n\nCaptain Fernán keeps a wary watch. \"Tomorrow we cross into Infante Juan's kingdom. Stay alert.\"\n\nJune 9-11: Navarre\n\nThe border crossing is tense. Navarrese guards examine your party carefully, but your pilgrimage credentials and Santiago letter smooth the way. Still, you notice:\n\nGuards taking careful note of your party's size and composition\n\nWhispered conversations after you pass\n\nA rider departing quickly toward Pamplona\n\n\"They're reporting to someone,\" Sir Thomas murmurs. He fought in enough military campaigns to recognize intelligence gathering. \"Question is whether we're out of Navarre before anyone decides to act on that information.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán pushes the pace. You skirt around Pamplona itself, taking lesser roads. It adds miles but avoids the capital where Infante Juan might have forces ready to \"invite\" you to stay.\n\nOn the evening of June 10th, camping in a small monastery, Fray Hernando comes to you: \"Your Majesty, the prior here tells me riders came through yesterday asking about any notable travelers. They were Infante Juan's men.\"\n\n\"Looking for us specifically?\"\n\n\"He couldn't say. But someone is watching the roads.\"\n\nYou make a decision: \"We ride before dawn. Through Navarre fast, into France as quickly as possible.\"\n\nJune 12: The Pyrenees Crossing\n\nDawn finds you already in the saddle, climbing into the mountain passes. The route is demanding - steep, narrow paths, summer snow still visible on peaks - but your horses are strong and everyone is experienced from the Santiago journey.\n\nAround midday, disaster nearly strikes.\n\nCorporal Rodrigo's horse steps wrong on loose stones. The animal stumbles, nearly goes down. Rodrigo manages to stay mounted, but the horse is limping badly.\n\nCaptain Fernán examines it. \"Pulled tendon. He can walk, but can't be ridden for days.\"\n\nYou're in the middle of the Pyrenees, still technically in Navarre, with a lamed horse and riders potentially following. Sir Thomas suggests: \"We could double up - Rodrigo rides with someone else, lead the lame horse.\"\n\n\"Slows us significantly,\" Captain Fernán warns.\n\n\"Or,\" Sergeant García offers, \"we leave the horse at the next monastery with payment for care, pick up a replacement in France.\"\n\nYou decide: \"Leave the horse, push on. We need speed more than we need that animal.\"\n\nAn hour later, a small monastery appears. The monks accept the horse and generous payment (100 maravedís). Rodrigo doubles up with Martín, and the party continues.\n\nBy evening, you cross into France.\n\nJune 13: French Soil\n\nThe village of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port welcomes you. The moment you cross the border, the tension lifts palpably. You're out of Navarre, out of Infante Juan's reach.\n\nThat night, over dinner at the local monastery, Sir Thomas raises a cup: \"To His Majesty - through the mountains and past his enemies.\"\n\nEven Fray Hernando looks relieved. \"God's hand guided us through that crossing.\"\n\nYou're more pragmatic: \"Captain Fernán's planning and fast horses guided us. Though I'll accept God gets credit too.\"\n\nThe party laughs - the first real laughter since leaving Santiago.\n\nWeek Two: Through Southern France\n\nJune 14-17: To Toulouse\n\nThe French roads are excellent - better maintained than Castilian routes. Your party makes good time through Gascony and toward Toulouse. The countryside is recovering from war; you see burned villages being rebuilt, fields returning to cultivation.\n\nSir Thomas provides running commentary: \"Fought through here six years ago. Was all devastation then. The French are resilient.\"\n\nOn June 16th, you meet something unexpected: a large party of Italian merchants heading north from the Mediterranean ports. Their leader, a Florentine named Cosimo di Medici, is about forty, sharp-eyed and well-dressed.\n\nHe recognizes noble bearing if not your specific identity. Over wine at a tavern that evening (his party and yours are sharing lodging), he speaks of Italian politics, papal affairs, and Mediterranean trade.\n\n\"You travel to Rome?\" he asks casually.\n\nCaptain Fernán deflects: \"Perhaps. We follow where pilgrimage leads.\"\n\nCosimo smiles knowingly. \"Of course. Well, if 'pilgrimage' leads you to Rome, know that Pope Martin is practical man. He responds well to those who speak of mutual benefit, not just petition.\"\n\nAn interesting encounter. This Cosimo clearly has papal connections.\n\nJune 18-20: Toulouse\n\nThe great city of Toulouse receives you well. The Archbishop, Bernard du Rosier, is a scholar-diplomat, about sixty, with shrewd eyes and political awareness.\n\nYour audience with him is crucial. You've prepared carefully with Fray Hernando, presenting yourself as young king seeking wisdom and guidance from French church hierarchy while on extended pilgrimage.\n\nThe Archbishop is impressed by your humility and Santiago letter. \"Your Majesty, a king who walks as pilgrim is rare. Most send proxies or make grand processional entries. You... walk.\"\n\nOver two days in Toulouse, you:\n\nAttend Mass at the great cathedral\n\nMeet with cathedral chapter and local clergy\n\nShare several meals with the Archbishop, discussing theology, governance, and the challenges of Christian kingship\n\nObserve the Archbishop carefully assessing you\n\nOn your departure, he provides a sealed letter: \"For any church authority you encounter, particularly should you find yourself in Avignon or... elsewhere. It attests to your sincere faith and my confidence in your character.\"\n\nFirst major letter of recommendation secured.\n\nThe Archbishop also shares intelligence: \"Your Majesty, word travels. I've heard whispers from Castile - tensions in Valladolid, questions about your whereabouts, competing narratives about your regency council. Your enemies work while you travel.\"\n\n\"What do you hear specifically?\"\n\n\"That Infante Juan seeks to portray you as unstable, driven by mystical visions rather than practical governance. That your sudden departure for 'extended pilgrimage' supports this narrative.\"\n\nConcerning, but not unexpected. \"And what do you tell those who ask you?\"\n\n\"That I met a young king of remarkable clarity and genuine faith. That mystical devotion and practical wisdom are not opposed. That Castile is fortunate in its king.\" He smiles. \"The truth, as I see it.\"\n\nReputation building in French church hierarchy progressing well.\n\nWeek Three: The Road to Avignon\n\nJune 21-25: Through Languedoc\n\nThe journey east toward Avignon takes you through prosperous country. You cross the Rhône River, pass ancient Roman ruins, see vineyards and olive groves.\n\nDuring this stretch, something develops: genuine camaraderie within the party.\n\nOne evening, camped by a river, Sir Thomas teaches you an English sword technique. Captain Fernán critiques, suggests modifications for your style. Sergeant García makes everyone laugh with stories of his first campaign. Even quiet Diego the secretary joins in, revealing surprising skill at chess when someone produces a traveling set.\n\nFray Hernando observes this with interest. Later, he remarks: \"Your Majesty, you're building something here. Not just guards who follow orders, but companions who believe in you.\"\n\n\"Is that dangerous? Getting too familiar?\"\n\n\"Getting too distant is more dangerous. Kings who treat men as tools find themselves with broken tools when crisis comes. Kings who build loyalty through shared hardship...\" He gestures at the camp. \"They build something that endures.\"\n\nJune 26-28: Avignon\n\nThe old papal city.\n\nAvignon rises before you - massive papal palace dominating the skyline, walls and towers proclaiming its former glory. Though the papacy returned to Rome in 1420, only ten years ago, Avignon remains a power center.\n\nYour party enters through the southern gate. The Vice-Legate of Avignon, Cardinal Pierre de Foix, receives you with great ceremony once he learns a visiting king has arrived.\n\nThe Cardinal is perhaps fifty, French nobility, sophisticated and worldly. He remembers when Avignon was the papal seat, when seven popes ruled from this city during the schism.\n\n\"Your Majesty honors us. Santiago's Archbishop wrote ahead - we expected you might come this way.\"\n\nOver the next three days in Avignon, you:\n\nDay One:\n\nTour the magnificent papal palace\n\nPray in the palace chapel where popes once celebrated Mass\n\nMeet with the Vice-Legate privately\n\nBegin explaining your journey and hopes\n\nDay Two:\n\nFormal audience with Cardinal de Foix and assembled clergy\n\nPresent your case: young king seeking papal guidance, hoping for crusade blessing against Granada\n\nThe Cardinal asks pointed questions:\n\"Why should Rome care about Granada when Hussites threaten Bohemia?\"\n\n\"Can Castile actually mount successful crusade, or is this political theater?\"\n\n\"What can you offer the Holy See beyond piety?\"\n\nYou answer thoughtfully, with Fray Hernando's coaching:\n\nGranada's conversion serves broader Christian unity and demonstrates papal authority still commands crusades\n\nYou've studied frontier conditions and believe with proper backing success is achievable\n\nA successful crusade creates strong, grateful ally in Iberia\n\nThe Cardinal is impressed but non-committal.\n\nDay Three:\n\nPrivate dinner with Cardinal de Foix\n\nHe speaks frankly: \"Your Majesty, I will write you strong letter for Rome. But understand - Pope Martin is politician as much as pontiff. He grants nothing without calculating benefit. Your youth works against you; kings often grow more valuable with age. But your genuine faith and strategic thinking... those work for you.\"\n\nHe continues: \"When you reach Rome, understand the curial politics. The Pope has concerns: Italian territorial conflicts, reconciliation with Constantinople, the Hussite problem, managing various kings' ambitions. Show him how your success advances his priorities, not just your own.\"\n\nValuable strategic advice received.\n\nThe Cardinal provides not one but two letters:\n\nFormal letter of recommendation attesting to your faith and character\n\nPrivate letter to Cardinal Giordano Orsini in Rome, the Pope's closest advisor, introducing you as \"a remarkable young king worth the Holy Father's attention\"\n\nMajor advancement in papal connections achieved.\n\nBefore you leave, Cardinal de Foix adds: \"Your Majesty, one warning. Pope Martin is seventy-two, not in robust health. The vultures circle - cardinals positioning for the next conclave. When you arrive in Rome, you may find yourself in middle of succession politics whether you intend it or not. Be cautious whom you trust.\"\n\nWeek Four-Five: Into Italy\n\nJune 29 - July 12: Through Provence and Piedmont\n\nThe journey from Avignon toward Italy takes you through beautiful country:\n\nProvence with its lavender and vineyards\n\nAlpine foothills with spectacular vistas\n\nAncient Roman roads still functional after fourteen centuries\n\nIndependent city-states and small principalities\n\nSeveral notable events:\n\nJuly 2: The Mercenary Captain\n\nAt a crossroads inn, you encounter Sir John Hawkwood's former lieutenant, an Italian condottiero named Francesco Bussone, called \"Carmagnola.\" He's about forty, scarred and dangerous-looking, leading twenty mercenaries.\n\nHe recognizes military bearing in your party. Over ale, conversation develops. When he learns you're Castilian nobility (you don't reveal being the king), he offers insight:\n\n\"Italian wars are different from your reconquista, young lord. Here, it's professionals fighting other professionals. We capture, ransom, negotiate. Total war is bad for business - destroys the customers.\"\n\nSir Thomas engages him in shop talk about tactics and weapons. Information is exchanged.\n\nBefore parting, Carmagnola remarks: \"If you ever need Italian swords, send word. Professional soldiers respect professional soldiers.\"\n\nPotential military contact established.\n\nJuly 5: The Accident\n\nYoung Felipe's horse throws a shoe, steps on sharp stone, cuts its frog badly. The animal will be lame for a week at least.\n\nCaptain Fernán is frustrated: \"That's two horses now. And we're barely halfway through Italy.\"\n\nYou purchase a replacement in the next town - costs 400 maravedís for a decent courser. Your budget is holding but being tested.\n\nJuly 8: Letters from Home\n\nAt a monastery near Turin, a message catches up: forwarded from Toulouse, then Avignon, now here. It's from Álvaro de Luna.\n\nThe Constable's report is concerning:\n\n\"Your Majesty,\n\nYour letters received. I understand and support your course. But know the situation here grows tense:\n\nInfante Juan has left Valladolid, returned to his estates. He writes letters to nobles across Castile, claiming you've abandoned the realm for \"mystical wanderings\" and that firm governance is needed. Some nobles listen.\n\nThe regency council functions but with difficulty. Infante Enrique and I maintain uneasy cooperation. The Archbishop tries to mediate. The Marquis watches and waits.\n\nYour cabinet performs well: Daza tracks suspicious financial movements (Infantes raising funds), Sandoval reports growing factionalism at court, Manrique sends word from the frontier that Granada watches our internal conflicts with interest.\n\nI hold what I can, but your absence is felt. Return with something substantial, or return to a realm more divided than you left.\n\nYour faithful servant,\nÁlvaro de Luna\"\n\nYou share this with Captain Fernán and Fray Hernando that evening.\n\n\"We knew this would happen,\" the Captain says.\n\n\"Knowing and experiencing are different,\" you reply. \"How much time do we have?\"\n\nFray Hernando calculates: \"Álvaro's letter was written in early to mid-June, took nearly a month to reach us. Conditions may have worsened since then. But we're committed now - must press forward, secure what we came for, return as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe weight of your absence feels heavier suddenly.\n\nJuly 10-12: Approaching Genoa\n\nThe party reaches the Ligurian coast. You can see the Mediterranean - deep blue, dotted with sails. Genoa rises before you, one of the great maritime republics, its wealth evident in magnificent buildings and bustling port.\n\nCaptain Fernán looks at the sea, then at you. \"Majesty, we're making good time. It's July 12th. If we take ship from here to Rome, we arrive in perhaps ten days to two weeks. Still July, plenty of time for papal audiences.\"\n\n\"And if we continue overland?\"\n\n\"Another week, maybe eight days to Rome. We'd arrive toward the end of July.\"\n\nSir Thomas offers: \"The sea route is faster and your men are less tired. Save the horses for return journey if needed. These Genoese know their business - I'd trust their ships.\"\n\nYou consider. The horses have held up reasonably well, but two have been lost/injured. The party is in good spirits but seven weeks of riding shows on everyone. And time matters.\n\nDecision: Take ship from Genoa to Rome.\n\nJuly 13-14: Securing Passage\n\nCaptain Fernán negotiates with Genoese ship captains. After careful inquiry, he secures passage on a merchant galley, the Sant'Andrea, captained by an experienced Genoese sailor named Giacomo Spinola.\n\nCost: 1,200 maravedís for the entire party, horses included, with departure July 15th.\n\nThe Sant'Andrea is a sturdy vessel, perhaps 120 feet long, equipped with both oars and sails. Captain Spinola explains: \"We depart with cargo for Ostia - wine, woolens, some Genoese metalwork. Stop briefly in Livorno, then direct to Rome's port. Eight to ten days if wind cooperates, twelve if it doesn't.\"\n\nYour party boards on the evening of July 14th. The horses are nervous about the gangplank but manage. Your gear is stowed. Tomorrow, you sail for Rome.\n\nThat night, sleeping on deck under stars (the small cabins are for cargo), you reflect on the journey so far:\n\nSeven weeks since leaving Santiago\n\nSuccessfully passed through Navarre despite danger\n\nSecured strong letters from Toulouse and Avignon\n\nBuilt genuine bonds with your companions\n\nReceived concerning news from Castile but pressed forward\n\nNow mere days from Rome and papal audience\n\nFray Hernando finds you at the rail. \"Unable to sleep, Majesty?\"\n\n\"Thinking about what comes next. Everything depends on Rome now.\"\n\n\"Not everything. You've already accomplished much - these letters, these relationships, the reputation you're building. Even if Rome grants nothing, you don't return empty-handed.\"\n\n\"But the crusade bull is the key. Without it, my plan to unite the realm...\"\n\n\"May God grant it, then. But remember: we seek God's will, not just our preferred outcome.\"\n\nYou smile. \"You're right, of course. Though I admit I strongly prefer the outcome where God's will aligns with a crusade bull.\"\n\nThe monk chuckles. \"As do I, Your Majesty. As do I.\"\n\nWeek Six: The Sea Voyage\n\nJuly 15-23: Mediterranean Crossing\n\nThe voyage goes reasonably well:\n\nFirst Three Days: Fair winds, smooth sailing. The Sant'Andrea makes excellent time down the Italian coast. Most of your party is seasick initially (including you), but by day three everyone has adjusted. Only Captain Fernán remains miserable - the soldier is definitely a land creature.\n\nDays Four-Five: Brief stop in Livorno to deliver cargo and take on water. You spend a day ashore, grateful for solid ground. The local bishop hears a Castilian king is in port; you grant him brief audience, receive his blessing and a small letter of introduction.\n\nDays Six-Eight: The final leg to Ostia. Wind is less favorable; the galley must row for stretches. You watch the oarsmen with fascination - free men, not slaves, working in shifts, their rhythm maintained by a drumbeat.\n\nSir Thomas points out sails on the horizon: \"See how that galley shadows us? Ensuring we're not pirates. The waters near Rome are well-patrolled.\"\n\nDay Nine - July 23, 1430: Late afternoon, the coast of Latium appears. By evening, you can see Ostia's port. Captain Spinola brings the Sant'Andrea expertly into harbor as sun sets.\n\n\"Welcome to Rome, Your Majesty,\" he says with a grin. \"Well, Ostia. Rome proper is about fifteen miles upriver. You'll ride there tomorrow.\"\n\nYou pay the agreed passage (1,200 maravedís) plus generous gratuity (200 more) for excellent service. Captain Spinola is delighted: \"If Your Majesty requires return passage, the Sant'Andrea is at your service.\"\n\nYou spend the night in Ostia at a comfortable inn. Tomorrow, Rome itself.\n\nJuly 24, 1430: Entering the Eternal City\n\nThe fifteen-mile ride from Ostia to Rome follows the ancient Via Ostiense. The road is magnificent - Roman engineering still functional after fourteen centuries.\n\nAs you approach, Rome rises before you: ancient walls, towers, churches, the massive bulk of St. Peter's Basilica dominating the Vatican hill across the Tiber.\n\nSir Thomas, who campaigned in France but never reached Italy, is awestruck: \"By God's wounds... I've heard tales, but...\"\n\nEven Captain Fernán, miserable from the sea voyage, straightens in his saddle. \"That's Rome.\"\n\nFray Hernando is openly weeping. \"The Eternal City. Where Peter died. Where the Church began.\"\n\nYou feel it too - the weight of history, the significance of this place. Every stone has story, every church holds relics of martyrs and saints.\n\nYour party enters through the Porta San Paolo. Guards examine credentials; when they see letters from Santiago, Toulouse, and Avignon, their attitude shifts to respect.\n\n\"Noble pilgrims? Welcome to Rome. The papal palace is in the Vatican, across the Tiber. Or you may lodge in the city proper - many monasteries host pilgrims.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán already has arrangements. You proceed to the Monastery of Santa Maria in Trastevere, where the archbishop of Avignon wrote ahead to ensure quality lodging.\n\nThe monks receive you with ceremony once they learn a king has arrived. The prior, an elderly Roman named Brother Benedetto, is worldly-wise:\n\n\"Your Majesty, welcome. Santiago's letter preceded you, as did Avignon's. You seek papal audience?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Then know: Pope Martin is in residence at the Vatican. He's elderly, but his mind remains sharp. Securing audience requires proper petition through the papal curia. This can take days or weeks. But...\" He smiles slightly. \"Avignon's Cardinal wrote to Cardinal Orsini on your behalf. That opens doors.\"\n\nHe continues: \"I suggest: rest a day from your journey. Tomorrow, present yourself formally at the Vatican with your letters. Request audience through proper channels. With Cardinal Orsini's interest, you should have answer within a few days.\"\n\nYou have arrived in Rome successfully, with good letters of recommendation, in late July - exactly as planned. Time remains for papal diplomacy before you must depart for Seville.\n\nChapter 3 Summary: Journey Success\n\nWhat You Accomplished:\n\n1.

        },

          "text": "For the second question, this is important historical context. By 1430:\n- The major crusades to the Holy Land had ended (last one was late 13th century)\n- Crusading ideology still existed but had evolved\n- There were crusades against Hussites in Bohemia (ongoing in 1430)\n- The Reconquista in Iberia was framed in crusading terms\n- But 1430 is not the height of crusading fervor like 1095-1291\n\nThe rhetoric could be violent, but by this period there was also:\n- More sophisticated theological thinking about just war\n- Recognition of conversion vs. conquest\n- Political rather than purely religious motivations often dominated\n- The Church had developed more nuanced positions on forced conversion\n- Economic and political considerations were often paramount\n\nI should present both Captain Fernán's practical/political view and Fray Hernando's theological/moral view on how to proceed, while also answering the historical question about crusading culture in 1430.\n\nEvening Conference - July 24, 1430\n\nYou summon Captain Fernán and Fray Hernando to your quarters in the monastery. The three of you sit around a simple wooden table with wine and bread - the monastery's hospitality.\n\n\"Tomorrow we begin the real work,\" you say. \"I need your counsel on how to approach this.\"\n\nThe Historical Question\n\nBefore they respond, you pause. \"Father, let me ask you something. In this time, when crusades are called - is it common for them to be violent affairs? 'Drive out the infidel,' 'Deus Vult,' with little regard for human life? I've heard the tales of the crusades to Jerusalem, but I want to understand what Rome actually expects when they grant such bulls.\"\n\nFray Hernando sets down his wine, considering carefully.\n\nFray Hernando's Perspective on Crusading Culture (1430)\n\n\"Your Majesty, that's a complicated question. Let me try to answer honestly.\"\n\nHe leans forward. \"The great crusades to Jerusalem - the First Crusade of 1095, the subsequent efforts - yes, those were marked by tremendous violence. 'Deus Vult' - God wills it - became the battle cry. When Jerusalem fell in 1099, the crusaders massacred Muslims and Jews alike. Tens of thousands died. The streets literally ran with blood.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"But Your Majesty, that was over three hundred years ago. We are not living in 1095.\"\n\n\"What's changed?\"\n\n\"Much. The crusading movement has... evolved. And not always for the better, but differently. Let me explain the current reality in 1430:\n\nFirst, crusading theology has become more sophisticated. The Church has spent centuries debating just war theory. Saint Thomas Aquinas, a century and a half ago, laid out clear principles:\n\nWar must have just cause\n\nMust be declared by proper authority\n\nMust have right intention (peace, not conquest for its own sake)\n\nMeans must be proportionate\n\nNon-combatants should be protected when possible\n\nThese principles are taught in universities, debated by theologians. The simple 'God wills it, kill them all' approach is... less acceptable to educated churchmen now.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán grunts. \"Tell that to soldiers in the field.\"\n\n\"True,\" Fray Hernando acknowledges. \"The gap between theology and practice remains wide. But the official church position has nuance now.\"\n\nHe continues: \"Second, forced conversion is officially opposed. Canon law is clear - baptism must be voluntary. Pope Gregory VII, back in 1073, stated that Jews should not be forcibly converted. This principle extends to Muslims as well. The ideal is conversion through persuasion, through demonstrating Christian truth, through offering protection and better life.\"\n\n\"But in practice?\"\n\n\"In practice... messier. After conquest, there's often tremendous pressure on Muslims to convert. Not official force, but economic disadvantage, social exclusion, sometimes local violence that authorities ignore. The Church officially condemns this, but doesn't always prevent it.\"\n\nThe Current State of Crusading (1430)\n\nFray Hernando shifts to contemporary examples:\n\n\"The Reconquista in Iberia - which is what concerns you - has its own character. It's been going on for seven hundred years. By now, it's as much about territorial expansion, noble ambition, and economic gain as about faith. Yes, crusading bulls are issued, but everyone understands the political dimensions.\n\nIn practice, Iberian reconquista has involved:\n\nConquest followed by treaties allowing Muslims to remain under Christian rule\n\nProtection of Muslim communities (mudéjars) who pay taxes and live under Christian law\n\nSometimes forced conversions, but more often economic incentives to convert\n\nPeriods of relative tolerance alternating with periods of persecution\n\nMuch intermarriage, cultural exchange, even alliance between Christian and Muslim nobles\n\nIt's not... pure holy war. It's complicated medieval politics with religious justification.\"\n\nHe takes a drink. \"The Hussite Crusades - happening right now in Bohemia - those are different. More ideological, more violent, because it's Christians fighting Christians deemed heretics. The rhetoric is harsh: 'extirpate the heresy.' Several crusades have been launched since 1420. They've been... brutal. And largely unsuccessful, which embarrasses the Church.\"\n\n\"So what does Pope Martin actually think about crusades in 1430?\"\n\nPope Martin V's Likely View\n\nFray Hernando chooses his words carefully:\n\n\"Pope Martin is practical above all. He ended the Great Schism, reunified the Church, restored papal authority. He's elderly, politically sophisticated, concerned with maintaining Church power and prestige.\n\nWhen he considers a crusade bull, he thinks about:\n\nPolitical benefits: Does this strengthen papal authority? Does it create useful alliances? Does it demonstrate the Pope can still summon Christian princes to holy war?\n\nPractical feasibility: Can it actually succeed? Failure embarrasses the Church - the Hussite crusades prove this.\n\nTheological justification: There must be legitimate religious purpose, but it doesn't have to be 'kill all Muslims.' Conversion, protecting Christian populations, recovering Christian lands, defending against aggression - these all work.\n\nFinancial considerations: Crusade bulls allow special taxation. The Church gets a cut. This matters.\n\nWhen you seek a crusade bull for Granada, Pope Martin will ask:\n\nCan you actually win?\n\nWhat's your real goal - conquest, conversion, or political consolidation?\n\nHow does this benefit the Church?\n\nWill this be another embarrassing failure?\n\nHe cares less about 'Deus Vult' rhetoric and more about practical outcomes.\"\n\nThe Moral Reality\n\nFray Hernando's voice becomes more intense:\n\n\"Your Majesty, here's the uncomfortable truth: crusading language is still used, crusading privileges are still granted, but by 1430, most educated people understand that crusades are political-military campaigns with religious justification, not pure expressions of divine will.\n\nThe violent rhetoric exists, yes. Some preachers still use it to whip up fervor. Common soldiers might believe they're doing God's work by killing Muslims. But at the level you're operating - negotiating with the Pope, planning strategy - everyone involved understands the political dimensions.\n\nThat doesn't make crusades moral. War is still war. People still die. Muslims will still suffer if you conquer Granada, regardless of your intentions. Forced conversion still happens even when officially forbidden. Violence against non-combatants still occurs.\n\nBut it's also not the indiscriminate slaughter of 1099. There are rules now, even if imperfectly followed. There are expectations of mercy, protection of non-combatants, allowing surrender. And conversion through persuasion rather than force is the stated ideal, even if the reality falls short.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes directly. \"You asked in confession about distinguishing your will from God's will. This is exactly that question. You can obtain a crusade bull. You can frame Granada's conquest in religious terms. The Pope may grant it. But you must be honest with yourself about what you're actually doing and why.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán's Practical Interjection\n\nThe Captain has been listening with increasing restlessness. Now he speaks:\n\n\"With respect, Father, His Majesty asked about crusading culture because he needs to understand what the Pope expects to hear. So let me add the soldier's perspective:\n\nWhat Rome wants to hear:\n\nYou're spreading Christianity\n\nYou're recovering lands lost to Islam\n\nYou're protecting Christian populations\n\nYou'll respect Church authority and give generous donations from conquests\n\nWhat Rome doesn't care about:\n\nWhether you personally believe it's holy war\n\nExactly how violent it gets (as long as not scandalously excessive)\n\nWhether conversions are genuinely voluntary\n\nYour real political motivations\n\nWhat Rome fears:\n\nAnother expensive, embarrassing failure\n\nA king who gets the bull then ignores Church interests\n\nScandal that makes the Church look bad\n\nYour Majesty, when we present your case, we emphasize your piety (which is genuine), your practical planning (which shows you can win), and your respect for Church authority (which assures them you're a reliable partner). We don't need to resolve the moral philosophy of crusading. We need to convince old men in Rome that granting you this bull serves their interests.\"\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\n\"The Captain is right about what the Pope wants to hear. I'm right about what the moral reality is. You need both, Your Majesty. Present yourself as the Pope expects, but don't lose sight of the actual moral weight of what you're proposing.\"\n\nThe Strategy Discussion\n\nCaptain Fernán shifts to the practical question. \"So, how do we approach the papal curia?\"\n\nHe pulls out notes. \"Brother Benedetto suggested we rest tomorrow, present ourselves the day after. I think that's too slow. Cardinal Orsini is expecting us - Avignon's letter announced your coming. Strike while the iron is hot.\"\n\nFray Hernando disagrees. \"Appearing too eager looks desperate. One day's rest shows confidence and respect for protocol. And frankly, Your Majesty, we've just completed seven weeks of travel and a sea voyage. Presenting yourself exhausted and travel-stained versus rested and properly prepared - which makes better impression?\"\n\n\"Fair point,\" the Captain concedes. \"But once we do present ourselves, how?\"\n\nThree Approaches Debated\n\nOption 1: Direct Petition to Papal Curia\n\nPresent yourself formally at the Vatican with all your letters\n\nRequest audience through official channels\n\nWait for papal bureaucracy to process request\n\nCould take days or even weeks\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"Safest, most respectful of protocol. But slow.\"\nFray Hernando: \"Shows proper humility and respect for Church authority.\"\n\nOption 2: Private Meeting with Cardinal Orsini First\n\nUse Avignon's private letter to request meeting with the Cardinal\n\nPresent your case to him personally\n\nLet him advocate for you to the Pope\n\nBypass some bureaucracy\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"Faster, uses the connection we built. Cardinals like Orsini can expedite matters.\"\nFray Hernando: \"But going around official channels might offend papal officials. Could create enemies.\"\n\nOption 3: Combination Approach\n\nPresent yourself formally through official channels\n\nSimultaneously send private message to Cardinal Orsini through Avignon's letter\n\nWork both paths at once\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"Covers all bases. Official respect plus personal connection.\"\nFray Hernando: \"Most balanced. Shows respect for both protocol and political reality.\"\n\nAdditional Considerations\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"Your Majesty, when you do present yourself - whether to officials or to Cardinal Orsini - you must decide: how much do you reveal immediately?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Do you say openly 'I seek a crusade bull for Granada'? Or do you begin more generally - 'I seek Holy Father's wisdom and blessing' - and only reveal the crusade request once you have audience with the Pope himself?\"\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"Starting general might seem evasive. Better to be direct about what you want.\"\n\nFray Hernando: \"But specificity before you've built rapport risks having your request rejected by intermediaries who never bring it to the Pope. If Cardinal Orsini thinks it's a bad idea, he might quietly discourage it without the Pope ever hearing your full case.\"\n\nThe Timeline Question\n\nThe Captain raises another concern: \"We have about six weeks before we must sail for Seville to arrive by early November. That seems like plenty, but papal bureaucracy can be slow. How long do we give this before we must accept failure and depart?\"\n\n\"A month?\" you suggest.\n\n\"That leaves only two weeks to arrange ship and sail. Tight. I'd say we give it three to four weeks maximum - through mid to late August. If by August 20th we haven't secured papal audience, we reassess.\"\n\nFray Hernando nods reluctantly. \"God's timing is not always our timing. But yes, practically speaking, that's realistic.\"\n\nBoth Men Look to You\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"So, Majesty, your orders:\n\nWhen do we approach the Vatican?\n\nTomorrow (July 25) or rest one day and approach July 26?\n\nHow do we approach?\n\nOfficial channels only?\n\nCardinal Orsini first?\n\nBoth simultaneously?\n\nWhat do we reveal initially?\n\nFull crusade request immediately?\n\nGeneral pilgrimage/blessing first, specifics later?\n\nAnd one more thing:\" He hesitates. \"Do we reveal you're the King of Castile immediately, or present yourself as 'noble pilgrim from Castile' initially? Your royal status gets attention, but also raises expectations and complications.\"\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"And Your Majesty, remember Cardinal de Foix's warning: Pope Martin is elderly, succession politics are brewing. When we enter the Vatican, we enter a world of competing ambitions and factions. We must navigate carefully.\"\n\nBoth men await your decision.\n\nYour Majesty, how do you wish to proceed?"

That discussion of \"distinguishing your will from God's will\" would have been a separate theological conversation, not reference to confession. My apologies for that error.]\n\nThe conversation about approaching the Vatican continues, but you find yourself distracted. The mention of your father's sword - the excuse you used to return from the hermitage - reminds you that you've been carrying it this entire journey but haven't truly examined it closely since taking it from the palace armory.\n\n\"Excuse me a moment,\" you say, standing and crossing to where your gear is laid out.\n\nCaptain Fernán and Fray Hernando exchange glances but remain silent as you unbuckle the sword belt and draw the blade.\n\nYour Father's Sword\n\nThe weapon is beautiful - clearly a king's blade, not a common soldier's tool. It's a longsword, well-balanced, the length suggesting it was made for a man of similar height to you. Your father, Juan I, died when you were only two years old, so you have almost no memories of him. But you've held his sword before, worn it at ceremonies. Tonight, for the first time, you truly look at it.\n\nThe Blade\n\nThe steel is excellent quality - Spanish craftsmanship, possibly from Toledo, the legendary sword-making city. Despite being forty years old (forged sometime in the 1390s or earlier), the blade shows minimal pitting or rust. Someone - probably the royal armorer - has maintained it carefully all these years.\n\nRunning down the fuller (the groove along the blade's center) is an inscription in Latin. You angle it toward the candlelight to read:\n\n\"NON NOBIS DOMINE\"\n\n\"Not unto us, O Lord.\" The beginning of Psalm 115 - a psalm about humility, about giving glory to God rather than claiming it for oneself. A fitting inscription for a Christian king's sword.\n\nThe Crossguard\n\nThe crossguard is gilded bronze, with the arms of Castile and León on one side - the quartered castle and lion that represents your kingdom. On the other side, you notice something you'd never observed before: a small personal device, barely visible unless you look closely.\n\nIt's a tower - but not the castles of Castile's arms. A single tower, simplified, almost abstract.\n\nCaptain Fernán has come to look over your shoulder. \"That's curious, Majesty. A personal mark, perhaps? Did your father have a particular device or motto beyond the royal arms?\"\n\nYou shake your head. \"I was too young when he died. I don't know.\"\n\nFray Hernando joins you. \"May I?\" He examines the tower closely. \"A tower often symbolizes strength, refuge, or vigilance. In Christian symbolism, sometimes it represents the Church as refuge, or the Virgin Mary as 'tower of ivory.' But as a personal device...\" He shrugs. \"Your father chose it for his own reasons.\"\n\nThe Pommel\n\nThe pommel is a disk of steel, likely filled with lead for balance. But on its face is another inscription, this one in Castilian rather than Latin. The words are worn - your father's hand gripped here for years - but still legible:\n\n\"PARA CASTILLA Y LA FE\"\n\n\"For Castile and the Faith.\"\n\nSimple. Direct. Your father's purpose distilled to five words.\n\nThe Scabbard\n\nThe scabbard is leather over wood, covered with velvet - red, faded now to burgundy. Silver fittings at throat and chape (tip). Near the throat, tooled into the leather and still visible, is your father's name:\n\nJUAN REX CASTELLAE\n\nJuan, King of Castile.\n\nYour name. Your title. Your legacy.\n\nA Moment of Connection\n\nYou hold the sword up, feeling its balance. Your father held this same grip, fought with this blade, wore it at court and in campaign. He died when you were two - thrown from his horse while reviewing troops at Alcalá de Henares in October 1390. You never knew him.\n\nBut here, in your hands, is something he touched daily. Something he valued enough to have inscribed with his beliefs: Not unto us, Lord - humility before God. For Castile and the Faith - his purpose as king.\n\nCaptain Fernán speaks quietly: \"Your father was a warrior king, Majesty. Fought the Portuguese, the English, tried to press Castile's claims everywhere. Some called him ambitious, even reckless. But he believed in what he fought for.\"\n\n\"Did you know him?\"\n\n\"I was a boy when he died, but my father served under him briefly. Said King Juan was brave to the point of foolhardiness sometimes, but men followed him because he led from the front. Never asked his soldiers to face what he wouldn't face himself.\"\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"He also endowed monasteries, supported the Church, took his faith seriously. The sword's inscriptions aren't just pretty words - they reflected how he saw his kingship.\"\n\nYou slide the blade back into its scabbard. \"I took this sword as an excuse to return to the palace and catch the Infantes. But perhaps... perhaps there was more to that impulse than I realized.\"\n\n\"God works in mysterious ways,\" Fray Hernando says softly.\n\n\"Or perhaps I just wanted to carry my father's sword while doing something important.\" You buckle the belt back on. \"Either way, it's here. And tomorrow, we bring it to Rome.\"\n\nReturning to Strategy\n\nYou return to the table, but the moment with the sword has clarified something for you.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" you say, \"I've decided.\"\n\nBoth men lean forward attentively.\n\nYour Majesty, what is your decision regarding:\n\n1. Timing - Approach tomorrow (July 25) or rest and approach July 26?\n\n2. Method - Official channels, Cardinal Orsini first, or both simultaneously?\n\n3. Revelation - Full crusade request immediately, or general pilgrimage first?\n\n4. Identity - Present as King of Castile immediately, or begin as noble pilgrim?\n\nWhat are your orders?"

I will also be frank about how a blessing and a papal bull will stabilize the realm and also consolidate my own power. Faithful and god-fearing I may be, I am also a sinner and I would not deny that these worldly concerns do not affect me at all. I also indicate I am convinced that with papal support we can win the war and finally complete the reconquista. And with our own lands secure, we stand ready to spread christianity overseas and bring the holy father's word to other parts of Europe. The people of Castille are devout and stand ready, but they need a spark and a purpose to set them to task.\n\n\nThen I will reveal my spiritual request. I tell him I am driven by my purpose to bring God's kingdom to earth, or at least I try to do so. After much prayer, I decided to return to my Palace a few days in my pilgrimage to take my father's sword with me. Common sense told me to check on my regency council while I was back and was able to stop a plot against me. Coincidence? Part of me tells me I was just lucky, but I have been studying the inscription on my fathers sword more closely. Not unto us, my lord. I feel like I should lay this sword at your feet for this sword belongs to God. My request is this, can the holy father determine if God has guided me to retrieve my sword or not?\n\n\nHow do you think the holy father would respond?"

          "text": "First, let me consider what the player is proposing:\n1. Being very frank about the political/worldly motivations (consolidating power, stabilizing realm)\n2. Offering the practical argument that Castile could be a valuable ally for spreading Christianity beyond Iberia\n3. Then presenting a deeply spiritual request - asking the Pope to discern whether God guided him to retrieve his father's sword\n4. Offering to lay the sword at the Pope's feet symbolically\n\nThis is actually quite sophisticated. Let me think about Pope Martin V's character and likely response:\n\n**Pope Martin V (Oddone Colonna) in 1430:**\n- Age 72, elected 1417 (13 years into papacy)\n- Ended the Great Schism, restored papal authority\n- From powerful Roman Colonna family - deeply political\n- Focused on rebuilding papal finances and power after schism\n- Sophisticated, worldly, but also genuinely concerned with Church authority\n- Known for being pragmatic and shrewd\n- Would be impressed by competence but suspicious of manipulation\n- Would value honesty over false piety\n\n**How would Martin V likely respond to this approach?**\n\nThe honesty about political motivations would likely intrigue him. Popes in this era are sophisticated political operators - they KNOW kings have mixed motives. A young king who admits it openly rather than wrapping everything in false piety might actually earn respect. It shows self-awareness and sophistication.\n\nThe practical argument about Castile as an ally for further Christian expansion is smart - it gives Martin something concrete to gain.\n\nBut then the spiritual request about discerning God's guidance... this is where it gets interesting and risky.\n\n**Potential responses from Martin V:**\n\n**Option 1 - Impressed and Moved:**\nMartin might be genuinely impressed by this combination of political honesty and spiritual seeking. It's unusual. \n\nThis approach reveals a nuanced understanding of papal dynamics. The king presents a multifaceted request that speaks to both worldly and spiritual concerns, demonstrating a sophisticated political and religious intelligence that could intrigue a seasoned papal leader like Martin V.\n\nMartin would likely engage carefully, balancing political pragmatism with pastoral sensitivity. His response would involve strategic listening, probing Juan's deeper motivations while recognizing the symbolic weight of the sword gesture as a potential sign of genuine spiritual submission.\n\nThe potential interaction suggests a delicate diplomatic dance - where political calculation meets sincere spiritual inquiry, creating a complex moment of potential mutual understanding between a young king and an experienced pontiff.\n\nMartin understands the nuanced risks: endorsing a crusade could backfire, yet dismissing a sincere spiritual request might alienate a potential ally. His approach would blend cautious discernment with openness to Juan's authentic spiritual yearning.\n\nThe Strategic Assessment\n\nYou lay out your approach. Both Captain Fernán and Fray Hernando listen intently, their expressions shifting as you explain.\n\nWhen you finish, there's a long silence.\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\nThe monk speaks first, his voice careful:\n\n\"Your Majesty, this is... remarkably sophisticated. And deeply risky.\"\n\nHe stands, begins pacing. \"Let me think through how Pope Martin might respond to each element:\n\nThe Political Honesty\n\n\"You begin by admitting your worldly motivations - consolidating power, stabilizing your realm. Most petitioners to the Pope wrap everything in pious language, pretending they have no political interests. You're proposing radical honesty.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"Pope Martin V is no fool. He's seventy-two years old, ended the Great Schism through political maneuvering, rebuilt papal authority. He knows kings have mixed motives. Everyone who enters his presence wants something political.\"\n\n\"So he'd appreciate the honesty?\"\n\n\"Possibly. Or he might think it's a more sophisticated form of manipulation - 'I'm so honest about my political motives that you should trust my spiritual sincerity.' It's a gamble.\"\n\nFray Hernando continues: \"But there's a case for it. Cardinals and popes tire of false piety. A young king who says openly 'Yes, I need this politically, AND I believe it serves God' - that's at least refreshing. It treats the Pope as intelligent enough to see through pretense.\"\n\nThe Practical Argument\n\n\"Your point about Castile standing ready to spread Christianity beyond Iberia if Granada is secured - that's smart. It gives Pope Martin a vision of return on his investment. Not just one crusade, but Castile becoming a reliable instrument of Church expansion.\"\n\n\"Would he believe it?\"\n\n\"He'd be interested. The Church faces threats - Hussites in Bohemia, tensions with Constantinople, Italian power struggles. Having a strong, loyal Catholic kingdom in Iberia that could project power overseas... yes, that has strategic value.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán interjects: \"And it's true, isn't it? Castile secured, unified, with crusade momentum - we could push into North Africa, support Church interests in the Mediterranean, counter Ottoman expansion. It's not empty promise.\"\n\nFray Hernando nods. \"The practical argument strengthens your case. But it's the spiritual request that concerns me.\"\n\nThe Spiritual Request - The Risk\n\nThe monk stops pacing, faces you directly.\n\n\"Your Majesty, asking the Pope to discern whether God guided you to retrieve your father's sword... this is profound and dangerous.\"\n\n\"Why dangerous?\"\n\n\"Because you're asking the Vicar of Christ to make a spiritual judgment about divine guidance in your personal life. That's not a small thing. Consider what it means:\n\nIf Pope Martin says YES - God guided you:\n\nHe's endorsing your interpretation of events\n\nHe's putting papal authority behind your claim of divine guidance\n\nIf your crusade then fails, he looks foolish\n\nHe's potentially creating a precedent where other kings claim divine guidance and demand papal confirmation\n\nIf Pope Martin says NO or refuses to judge:\n\nHe's implicitly questioning your spiritual experience\n\nBut he might still grant the crusade bull on political grounds\n\nYou've revealed uncertainty about your own discernment\n\nHe might see you as spiritually immature or confused\n\nIf he probes deeper:\n\nHe might ask questions you're not prepared to answer\n\nHe might expose contradictions or doubts\n\nHe could use this to test you, manipulate you, or guide you in directions you don't anticipate\"\n\nFray Hernando sits back down. \"But here's what makes it potentially powerful: it's unusual. Popes meet kings seeking crusade bulls all the time. They almost never meet a young king who openly admits political motivation while also genuinely wrestling with spiritual discernment. That uniqueness might intrigue him.\"\n\nThe Sword Symbolism\n\n\"Offering to lay your father's sword at the Pope's feet, acknowledging it belongs to God - that's powerful medieval symbolism. Kings offering swords to Popes, submitting temporal power to spiritual authority. Martin V would understand that gesture deeply.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán adds: \"It's also theatrical. Popes appreciate theater. The young king, bearing his dead father's sword with its inscription 'Not unto us, Lord,' offering it to the Vicar of Christ... it's a scene he'd remember.\"\n\n\"But,\" Fray Hernando warns, \"symbolism cuts both ways. If he accepts the gesture and you fail, it becomes mockery. If he rejects it, you've offered and been refused. The symbolism must be backed by substance.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán's Practical Concerns\n\nThe soldier has been thinking while the monk spoke. Now he interjects:\n\n\"Majesty, I understand the strategy - the honesty disarms suspicion, the spiritual seeking engages him personally, the symbolism creates memorable moment. But let me offer soldier's perspective:\n\nThis approach requires perfect execution. You're walking a razor's edge between sophisticated and naive, between honest and manipulative, between pious and presumptuous. One wrong word, one hint of insincerity, and it collapses.\n\nYou're very young. Pope Martin might simply think: 'This boy is confused, mixing up politics and spirituality, reading too much into coincidence.' He might be patronizing rather than impressed.\n\nYou're gambling everything on his response. If he's moved by your approach, you might get more than the crusade bull - you might get genuine papal mentorship, support, endorsement. If he's unimpressed or suspicious, you've shown him uncertainty and complexity where simpler approach might have worked.\"\n\nHe leans forward. \"I'm not saying don't do it. I'm saying: are you prepared for however he responds? Can you handle it if he dismisses your spiritual concerns? Can you accept it if he says 'No, God did not guide you, it was just fortune or your own planning'?\"\n\nFray Hernando's Discernment\n\nThe monk has been praying quietly while the Captain spoke. Now he looks up:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I must ask: Why do you want to present it this way? Not strategically - I understand that. But in your heart, why?\"\n\nHe continues gently: \"Is it because you genuinely want papal discernment about God's guidance in your life? Do you truly want the Pope to tell you whether God led you back to the palace? Or is it because you think this approach will be most effective at securing the crusade bull?\"\n\n\"Can't it be both?\"\n\n\"It can. But you need to know which is primary, because Pope Martin will try to discern the same thing. He's spent fifty years in the Church, decades in high politics. He reads people. If your spiritual seeking is genuine but secondary to political aims, he'll sense it. If your spiritual seeking is primary and you're being honest about the political dimensions, he'll sense that too.\"\n\nThe Core Question\n\nFray Hernando asks directly: \"Your Majesty, what do you want the Pope to say when you ask if God guided you? Do you want him to confirm that God led you? Or do you want honest discernment even if he says it was coincidence and your own cleverness?\"\n\n\"Because that answer will show in how you present the question. And Martin V will notice.\"\n\nThe Alternative Approach\n\nCaptain Fernán offers: \"Majesty, there's a simpler path. Present yourself as young king seeking crusade bull for Granada. Use your excellent letters of recommendation. Make the political and practical arguments. Show your faith and piety naturally through how you speak and act. Don't force the spiritual drama.\"\n\n\"It's less memorable, but also less risky. You'd likely still get audience, possibly get the bull based on practical merits.\"\n\nFray Hernando counters: \"But the Captain's approach doesn't distinguish you. Martin sees that petition constantly. Your Majesty's proposed approach - the radical honesty, the spiritual seeking, the symbolic gesture - that's unique. It could create real relationship with the Pope rather than just transactional exchange.\"\n\nBoth Men Wait\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"I'll support whatever you choose, Majesty. But know the risks.\"\n\nFray Hernando: \"And Your Majesty, know your own heart first. Why do you truly want to present it this way? The answer to that will determine if this approach is wise or foolish.\"\n\nThey both look at you expectantly.\n\nYour Majesty, having heard their counsel:\n\n1. Do you still want to proceed with your proposed approach (political honesty + spiritual request + sword symbolism)?\n\n2. Or do you modify it somehow?\n\n3. And crucially - can you answer Fray Hernando's question: What do you WANT the Pope to say when you ask if God guided you? Do you want confirmation, or do you want honest discernment regardless of the answer?\n\nYour response will shape how we proceed with securing papal audience and what you say when you meet Pope Martin V."

          "text": "This is moving from political maneuvering to genuine spiritual seeking. This changes the dynamic significantly. Both Fray Hernando and Captain Fernán would recognize this shift - this is no longer just strategy, this is Juan genuinely wanting spiritual confirmation and guidance.\n\nFray Hernando would be deeply moved by this honesty. He's been trying to help Juan discern the difference between his own will and God's will. Juan is now openly asking for help with that discernment from the highest spiritual authority available.\n\nCaptain Fernán would respect the honesty but might be concerned about the vulnerability it represents.\n\nThe question now is: how would Pope Martin V likely respond to this genuine spiritual seeking combined with political honesty?\n\nLet me think about Pope Martin V (Oddone Colonna):\n- Elected 1417, ending the Great Schism\n- 72 years old in 1430\n- From powerful Roman Colonna family\n- Politically sophisticated, but also genuinely devout\n- Focused on restoring papal authority and prestige\n- Known for being practical and diplomatic\n- Not particularly mystical, but respects genuine piety\n- Would have significant experience reading people\n\nHow would he respond to an 18-year-old king who:\n1. Is brutally honest about political motivations\n2. Genuinely seeks spiritual guidance about divine will\n\n3. Offers his father's sword as a symbolic gesture\n4. Asks for blessing and tasking specifically for Granada crusade\n\nJuan's approach is strategically brilliant. By presenting his mixed motivations openly, he demonstrates a rare authenticity that could deeply impress the Pope. The symbolic sword and specific request for blessing transform a potential political negotiation into a spiritual covenant. This isn't just a young king seeking validation, but a potential instrument of divine mission.\n\nThe Truth Revealed\n\nYour words hang in the air. Both men see something shift in your expression - this is no longer strategic calculation. This is genuine.\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\nThe monk's entire demeanor changes. He leans forward, eyes intent.\n\n\"Your Majesty... this is what you should present to the Pope. Exactly this.\"\n\nHe stands, animated in a way you've rarely seen. \"You've just articulated something profound. You're not asking him to rubber-stamp your interpretation. You're genuinely asking: Does God guide me? Does He recognize me as His servant? That's real spiritual seeking.\"\n\n\"And the specific request - to bless the sword and task you to bring Christianity to Granada - that's brilliant because it gives the Pope agency. You're not saying 'God already told me to do this, confirm it.' You're saying 'I don't know if God guides me, but I want to serve Him. Will you, as His Vicar, give me this task?'\"\n\nFray Hernando paces excitedly. \"Do you see the difference? One is asking for validation. The other is asking for vocation - for calling. Popes understand calling. They confer vocations, they task bishops and abbots, they send legates on missions. You're asking to be sent as a crusader, not just permitted.\"\n\nHe stops, faces you. \"Your Majesty, I've been wondering since we left Santiago whether this journey was truly about the crusade bull or about something deeper. Now I know. You're seeking spiritual confirmation that you're on the right path. That's... that's legitimate. That's holy.\"\n\n\"Even if mixed with political necessity?\"\n\n\"Especially because it's mixed with political necessity. You're not pretending to be a mystic saint. You're a king trying to serve God while navigating the realities of power. That's honest. That's the actual struggle of Christian kingship.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán's Measured Response\n\nThe soldier is quieter, more thoughtful. Finally, he speaks:\n\n\"Majesty, I'm a simple man. I fight, I follow orders, I pray when I'm told to. I don't understand theology like Father Hernando. But I understand honesty, and what you just said... that's honest.\"\n\nHe shifts uncomfortably. \"I'll tell you something. When we were riding through the Pyrenees, when Rodrigo's horse went lame and we were still in Navarre with riders maybe following us, I prayed. Not fancy prayer - just 'God, get us through this.' And we made it. Was that God? Was it luck? Was it good planning? I don't know.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"But if the Pope - the actual Pope, Christ's Vicar on Earth - could tell me 'Yes, God heard you, God helped you,' I'd want to know that too. So I understand why you're asking.\"\n\n\"You think the Pope will dismiss it?\"\n\n\"I think the Pope might be moved by it. You're eighteen years old, carrying your dead father's sword, genuinely trying to figure out if God speaks to you. That's not cynical politics. That's... human.\"\n\nFray Hernando's Guidance on Presentation\n\nThe monk sits back down, suddenly focused and practical:\n\n\"Your Majesty, here's how I think you should present this to Pope Martin:\n\nFirst, the political honesty: Exactly as you described. 'Holy Father, I have worldly needs - consolidating power, unifying my realm, completing the Reconquista. I won't pretend otherwise. A crusade bull serves these purposes.'\n\nSecond, the spiritual seeking: 'But Holy Father, I also have a spiritual question. I pray constantly, trying to discern God's will from my own desires. When I pray, most thoughts are my own planning. But sometimes I sense... something more. I don't know if it's God or imagination.'\n\nThird, the specific story: 'I felt moved to return and retrieve my father's sword. Common sense suggested checking on my council. I discovered and stopped a plot. Coincidence? My own cleverness? Or did God guide me? I genuinely don't know.'\n\nFourth, the request: 'I bring this sword - inscribed Non Nobis Domine, Not Unto Us Lord - and I ask: Will you bless it? Will you task me, as God's Vicar, to use it to bring Christianity to Granada? Not because I'm certain God has called me, but because I want to serve Him and I seek your guidance on whether this is how I should serve.'\"\n\nHe pauses. \"Do you see how this works? You're honest about uncertainty, you're asking for guidance rather than validation, and you're giving the Pope the power to make it God's will by blessing and tasking you. That's theologically sound and politically astute.\"\n\nThe Risk Assessment\n\nCaptain Fernán adds: \"But Majesty, understand what you're revealing. You're showing the Pope that you have doubts, that you question whether God speaks to you, that you need guidance. That's vulnerability. It could be seen as weakness.\"\n\nFray Hernando counters: \"Or as humility. The kind of humility that the inscription on the sword itself commands - Not unto us, Lord. A king who admits he doesn't have all the answers, who genuinely seeks divine guidance... that's rare.\"\n\n\"Pope Martin might respect it,\" the Captain concedes. \"Or he might think you're too uncertain to be trusted with a crusade bull. It's a gamble.\"\n\n\"Everything is a gamble,\" you say quietly.\n\nThe Theological Dimension\n\nFray Hernando becomes more serious: \"Your Majesty, I must prepare you for possible answers the Pope might give:\n\nHe might say: 'Yes, God guided you. I bless this sword and task you with bringing Christianity to Granada.' That's the answer you hope for.\n\nHe might say: 'I cannot know God's mind with certainty, but I bless your intention and your sword. Proceed with the crusade.' That's non-committal but supportive.\n\nHe might say: 'Young king, you must learn to distinguish your thoughts from God's voice. The ability to discern comes with spiritual maturity. For now, trust the Church's guidance rather than seeking signs.' That's gentle dismissal.\n\nHe might say: 'What you experienced was your own wisdom, not divine intervention. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't pursue the crusade.' That's practical but not spiritually affirming.\n\nOr he might surprise you entirely - ask questions, probe deeper, offer spiritual direction you didn't expect.\"\n\n\"Can you accept any of those answers, Your Majesty? Even the ones that say God didn't guide you?\"\n\nYou consider this carefully. Can you?\n\nYour Father's Sword\n\nYou draw the blade again, looking at the inscription: Non Nobis Domine.\n\n\"When my father had this inscribed, he was acknowledging something. That victories aren't his alone. That kingship is stewardship, not ownership. That glory belongs to God.\"\n\nYou look at both men. \"If Pope Martin tells me God didn't guide me back to the palace, that it was just my own planning and good fortune... I can accept that. Because either way, the inscription still commands me: Not unto us, Lord. My job is to serve, whether I hear divine whispers or not.\"\n\n\"And if he blesses the sword and tasks you with the crusade?\" Fray Hernando asks.\n\n\"Then I'll know that God, through His Vicar, has called me to this. Not because of mystical visions, but because the Church itself has said: this is your task. That would be... enough. More than enough.\"\n\nThe Decision Crystallizes\n\nCaptain Fernán stands. \"Then I know how to proceed. We approach this honestly, vulnerably, seeking genuine guidance. It's risky, but it's true to who you are.\"\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"And Your Majesty, whatever the Pope says, you'll have your answer. Either God guides you directly, or the Church guides you as God's instrument. Either way, you'll know your path.\"\n\n\"When do we seek audience?\" you ask.\n\nCaptain Fernán: \"Tomorrow - July 25 - we rest, pray, prepare. You need to be clear-headed and spiritually centered for this. July 26, we present ourselves at the Vatican with all your letters, request formal audience, and also send private message to Cardinal Orsini through Avignon's letter.\"\n\nFray Hernando: \"And Your Majesty, tonight and tomorrow, we pray. Not planning prayers, not strategic prayers. Just... seeking. If God speaks to you in prayer, let it be real.\"\n\nThe Evening Ends\n\nBoth men prepare to leave you to your rest. But Fray Hernando pauses at the door:\n\n\"Your Majesty, one more thing. When you said you want to know if God recognizes you as His servant... God recognizes everyone as His child. The question isn't whether He sees you, but whether you're willing to see Him. What you're doing - genuinely seeking, admitting uncertainty, asking for guidance - that's the beginning of real spiritual life.\"\n\n\"Not mystical visions?\"\n\n\"Mystical visions are rare and not always reliable. But a king who genuinely tries to serve God while navigating the messy realities of power? That's something. That's enough.\"\n\nJuly 25, 1430 - Day of Rest and Preparation\n\nYou spend the day in prayer, contemplation, and practical preparation. The sword lies before you in the monastery chapel as you pray. The inscription catches the candlelight: Non Nobis Domine.\n\nTomorrow, you will present yourself at the Vatican. You will seek audience with Pope Martin V. And you will bring your father's sword, seeking blessing and tasking.\n\nYour Majesty, are you ready to proceed to the papal audience? Or is there anything else you wish to do or discuss before taking this crucial step?"

Today, you will present yourself to the papal curia and seek audience with the Vicar of Christ.\n\nFray Hernando helps you prepare, ensuring your appearance is appropriate - clean, dignified, but not ostentatious. You wear good traveling clothes, not royal regalia. Your father's sword hangs at your side.\n\n\"Remember, Your Majesty,\" the monk counsels as you break your fast, \"humility and honesty. You are a pilgrim-king seeking guidance, not a monarch demanding audience.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán has the letters organized:\n\nArchbishop of Santiago's letter (opened, for official presentation)\n\nArchbishop of Toulouse's letter (opened)\n\nCardinal de Foix's formal letter from Avignon (opened)\n\nCardinal de Foix's private letter to Cardinal Orsini (sealed)\n\nYour party assembles: yourself, Captain Fernán, Fray Hernando, and Sergeant García (as escort). The others remain at the monastery.\n\nCrossing the Tiber\n\nThe walk from Trastevere to the Vatican takes you across the ancient Ponte Sant'Angelo, the bridge leading to the papal fortress-palace. Early morning light catches the Tiber's waters. Rome is waking - merchants opening shops, pilgrims already moving toward churches, the sounds of a city that has stood for over a thousand years.\n\nAs you cross the bridge, you see Castel Sant'Angelo rising on the right - the massive circular fortress that guards the Vatican approaches. Armed guards are visible on its walls.\n\n\"The fortress,\" Captain Fernán murmurs. \"The popes can retreat there if Rome becomes dangerous. During the sack of 1084, it saved Pope Gregory VII's life.\"\n\nThe weight of history is palpable.\n\nApproaching the Vatican\n\nThe Vatican complex sprawls before you on its hill across the river. At its heart rises the great Basilica of Saint Peter - though not the magnificent Renaissance structure that will be built in future centuries. This is the ancient Constantinian basilica, over a thousand years old, showing its age but still magnificent.\n\nTo the left of the basilica stands the papal palace - a complex of connected buildings that has grown over centuries. This is where Pope Martin V resides, where the papal curia conducts the business of the Church.\n\nYour party approaches the main entrance to the papal palace. Guards in papal livery - the crossed keys emblazoned on their surcoats - stand at attention. They're professional, alert, accustomed to receiving pilgrims, petitioners, and dignitaries from across Christendom.\n\nThe First Gate\n\nThe senior guard, a weathered man in his forties, steps forward as you approach.\n\n\"Good morning, pilgrims. State your business with the Holy See.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán speaks first, formal and respectful: \"We bring a noble pilgrim seeking audience with His Holiness Pope Martin V. We carry letters of recommendation from Santiago de Compostela, Toulouse, and Avignon.\"\n\nThe guard's eyes sharpen at \"Avignon.\" That name still carries weight.\n\n\"Your identity?\"\n\nYou step forward. \"I am Juan, King of Castile and León. I come as pilgrim and petitioner, seeking the Holy Father's wisdom and blessing.\"\n\nThe guard's posture immediately shifts - a king is not a common visitor. He bows. \"Your Majesty. Please, wait here a moment while I inform the chamberlain.\"\n\nHe disappears into the palace. You wait in the courtyard, feeling the eyes of other guards upon you. Fray Hernando whispers a prayer. Captain Fernán stands alert, hand near his sword out of habit.\n\nAfter perhaps ten minutes, the guard returns with an older man in clerical robes - black cassock, red trim indicating curial rank. He's perhaps sixty, with sharp eyes and the air of someone who has managed papal bureaucracy for decades.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he bows with practiced courtesy. \"I am Monsignor Paolo Caraffa, Chamberlain of the Apostolic Palace. We are honored by your presence. Please, come inside.\"\n\nInside the Apostolic Palace\n\nYou're led through corridors of stone and marble. The palace is a maze of rooms, chapels, offices, and halls. Clerics and officials move purposefully through the corridors. You catch glimpses of frescoed walls, glimpses into chapels where priests say Mass, the sounds of chanted offices echoing from unseen chambers.\n\nMonsignor Caraffa leads you to a well-appointed reception room. Tapestries depicting biblical scenes hang on the walls. A crucifix dominates one wall. Chairs and benches provide seating.\n\n\"Please, Your Majesty, be comfortable. May I examine your letters of introduction?\"\n\nYou hand over the three opened letters - Santiago, Toulouse, Avignon. He reads each carefully, his eyebrows rising slightly as he progresses.\n\n\"Most impressive credentials, Your Majesty. Archbishop Don Lope speaks highly of your pilgrimage. Archbishop du Rosier of Toulouse notes your theological discussions. And Cardinal de Foix...\" He looks up. \"The Vice-Legate of Avignon writes with considerable enthusiasm about your faith and character.\"\n\n\"I am grateful for their kindness.\"\n\n\"And you seek audience with His Holiness regarding...?\"\n\nThe Official Petition\n\nYou've prepared for this moment. \"Monsignor, I come with both practical and spiritual matters. I seek the Holy Father's blessing on my rule in Castile, his guidance on matters of governance and faith, and...\" you pause, then continue, \"I wish to discuss the possibility of completing the Reconquista in Iberia - bringing the Kingdom of Granada into Christendom.\"\n\nMonsignor Caraffa's expression doesn't change, but you sense heightened interest. \"A crusade bull, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\"I seek the Holy Father's wisdom on whether such a course is appropriate and feasible. I don't presume to demand anything - I come seeking guidance.\"\n\nThe monsignor nods slowly. \"Your Majesty's humility is noted and appreciated. The Holy Father receives many petitions for crusade bulls. He considers each carefully, weighing spiritual, political, and practical dimensions.\"\n\nHe sets the letters aside. \"I will present your petition to His Holiness's secretariat. Understanding that the Holy Father's schedule is complex - he manages the entire Church's affairs - I cannot promise immediate audience. But given your credentials and the respect these churchmen show you, I believe audience can be arranged.\"\n\n\"How long might that take?\"\n\n\"Days, certainly. Possibly a week or two. The Holy Father is elderly and cannot grant lengthy audiences to everyone who requests them. But you are a reigning Catholic monarch with excellent recommendations. You will be seen.\"\n\nThe Private Channel\n\nYou exchange glances with Fray Hernando. Time for the second approach.\n\n\"Monsignor, I also carry a private letter from Cardinal de Foix to Cardinal Giordano Orsini. The Cardinal of Avignon suggested this letter might... facilitate matters.\"\n\nMonsignor Caraffa's eyes gleam with understanding. He's a papal bureaucrat - he knows how things actually work.\n\n\"Ah. Cardinal Orsini is the Holy Father's most trusted advisor. If Cardinal de Foix has written to him on your behalf, that is... significant.\" He extends his hand. \"May I deliver that letter personally? Cardinal Orsini should be informed of Your Majesty's presence immediately.\"\n\nYou hand over the sealed letter. The monsignor examines the seal - genuine, from Avignon - and tucks it carefully into his robes.\n\n\"I will deliver this to Cardinal Orsini within the hour. He may wish to meet with Your Majesty before the formal papal audience. That would be... normal, for someone of your importance.\"\n\nTranslation: Cardinal Orsini will want to assess you privately before bringing you before the Pope.\n\nPractical Arrangements\n\n\"In the meantime, Your Majesty, you are lodged at...?\"\n\n\"The Monastery of Santa Maria in Trastevere.\"\n\n\"Excellent. Brother Benedetto runs a respectable establishment. I will send word there when we have news of audience timing. It may be today, it may be tomorrow, it may be several days. Patience is required when dealing with the Apostolic See.\"\n\nHe stands, and you rise as well. \"Your Majesty, one more matter. When audience is granted, you may bring two companions. I presume your chaplain,\" he nods at Fray Hernando, \"and perhaps your captain?\"\n\n\"Yes, that would be appropriate.\"\n\n\"Very good. The audience will likely be semi-private - His Holiness, perhaps Cardinal Orsini, and a secretary for records. Unless His Holiness decides to make it a formal audience, in which case more of the curia might attend. But for initial meeting, semi-private is customary.\"\n\nHe escorts you back toward the entrance. \"Your Majesty, may I speak frankly?\"\n\n\"Please.\"\n\n\"You come at an interesting time. His Holiness is seventy-two, in declining health though still sharp of mind. There is... awareness that his pontificate may not extend many more years. This colors everything in Rome. Cardinals position themselves. Factions form. When you enter the Vatican's inner chambers, you enter not just a holy place but a political arena.\"\n\n\"Cardinal de Foix warned me of this.\"\n\n\"Then you come prepared. Good. One more thing: His Holiness responds well to genuine faith. Many petitioners speak piously while thinking politically. If you genuinely seek spiritual guidance as well as political support, let that sincerity show. Pope Martin has spent fifty years in the Church. He knows the difference between performance and truth.\"\n\nThe Return to the Monastery\n\nYour party walks back across the Ponte Sant'Angelo toward Trastevere. The morning is well advanced now - Rome is fully awake, bustling with activity.\n\nCaptain Fernán speaks first: \"Well, that went as well as could be hoped. Official petition filed, private letter delivered to Cardinal Orsini, monsignor seemed impressed by our letters.\"\n\n\"Now we wait,\" you say.\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"But not idly. We pray, we prepare for the audience whenever it comes, and we stay ready.\"\n\nBack at the monastery, you settle into a strange limbo. You're in Rome, your goal within reach, but dependent on papal schedule and bureaucratic processes you cannot control.\n\nThat Afternoon - The Summons\n\nYou're in the monastery chapel, praying before the altar, when Brother Benedetto hurries in.\n\n\"Your Majesty! A messenger from the Vatican!\"\n\nA young clerk in curial robes waits in the monastery's receiving room. He bows deeply when you enter.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I bring word from Cardinal Giordano Orsini. His Eminence requests the honor of meeting with you privately tomorrow - July 27th - at the tenth hour (mid-morning). He wishes to discuss your petition and prepare you for audience with His Holiness.\"\n\n\"Tell His Eminence I am grateful and will attend at the appointed time.\"\n\nThe clerk bows again. \"His Eminence also asked me to convey that he was moved by Cardinal de Foix's letter and looks forward to meeting the young king whose faith and character impressed the Vice-Legate of Avignon so profoundly.\"\n\nAfter the messenger leaves, Captain Fernán grins. \"One day. We're in Rome one day and already meeting with the Pope's closest advisor. Your letters worked, Majesty.\"\n\nFray Hernando is more measured. \"Meeting Cardinal Orsini is crucial. He'll assess whether to bring you before the Pope, and he'll shape how you're presented. This is where your sincerity must shine through. If he thinks you're just another ambitious young king using piety as cover, he might quietly discourage your petition.\"\n\n\"And if he believes I'm genuine?\"\n\n\"Then he becomes your advocate. And Cardinal Orsini's advocacy means everything.\"\n\nEvening Preparation\n\nThat evening, the three of you prepare for tomorrow's meeting with Cardinal Orsini. Fray Hernando coaches you on appropriate forms of address, on how to read a cardinal's responses, on the balance between deference and dignity.\n\nYou practice explaining your situation - the political realities, the spiritual seeking, the question about your father's sword.\n\nCaptain Fernán interjects occasionally with practical concerns: \"Make sure he understands you can actually win. Popes don't grant crusade bulls for symbolic gestures. They want victories.\"\n\nAs night falls, you're alone in your room with your father's sword. You draw the blade, read the inscription again: Non Nobis Domine.\n\nTomorrow, you meet the man who advises the Pope. The man who will decide if you're worthy of being brought before the Vicar of Christ.\n\nEverything you've worked for, everything you've traveled for, comes down to the next few days.\n\nStatus - Evening of July 26, 1430\n\nAccomplished Today:\n\nSuccessfully presented yourself at the Vatican\n\nOfficial petition filed with papal chamberlain\n\nPrivate letter delivered to Cardinal Orsini\n\nStrong impression made with your letters of recommendation\n\nMeeting secured with Cardinal Orsini for tomorrow morning\n\nCurrent Position:\n\nLodged comfortably at Santa Maria in Trastevere\n\nParty in good health and spirits\n\nResources adequate (approximately 7,200 maravedís remaining)\n\nTimeline sufficient (early to mid-August target for papal audience, plenty of time before must leave for Seville)\n\nTomorrow - July 27:\nPrivate meeting with Cardinal Giordano Orsini, the Pope's closest advisor, at the Vatican\n\nThe Stakes:\nThis meeting with Cardinal Orsini will likely determine whether you receive papal audience and how you're presented to Pope Martin V. The cardinal will assess your sincerity, your capability, and whether supporting you serves the Church's interests.\n\nYour Majesty, you have successfully initiated the process. Tomorrow comes the crucial meeting with Cardinal Orsini.\n\nIs there anything you wish to do this evening in preparation? Any specific approach you want to take with the Cardinal tomorrow? Or shall we proceed to the meeting?"

Monsignor Caraffa knocks, then opens it.\n\n\"Your Eminence, His Majesty Juan of Castile.\"\n\nThe room beyond is a scholar's study - books everywhere, manuscripts on tables, a crucifix on the wall.

There are many reasons why i wanted to visit Rome. Some are personal and spiritual, but above all, I am a young king who wants to rule in God's image. I have a vision of how the world should be and sometimes I can catch a glimmer of God's kingdom on earth, if only for a fleeting moment. I started my pilgrimage and went to Santiago where I felt inspired to also visit Rome so I can personally declare my own service and that of my kingdom to the holy Church of Christ. Many have advised me against this move, citing rebellion in my absence and other worldly concerns such as safety, but I have a feeling I cannot grasp nor describe. A certain pull and a strange certainty that this is somehow the right thing to do. For better or for worse, I have decided to always follow this feeling and it now has led me here. Officially I am requesting papal support for my reconquista. It will unite my kingdom and solidify my own rule. Important matters of state for sure, but in my heart, I hope that the pope may help me understand my own prayers. Am I just a fool? Am I imagining things? Or am I right to follow my instinct, strange or dangerour they may sometimes appear to be?

Has visions of \"God's kingdom on earth\" - glimpses of how things should be\n4. Felt inspired/called to come to Rome\n5. Admits many advised against it (rebellion risk, safety concerns)\n6. Describes a \"feeling\" or \"pull\" - certainty this is right\n7. Has decided to always follow this feeling\n8. Officially requesting crusade support (acknowledges worldly benefits)\n9. But more importantly: wants Pope to help him understand his own prayers\n10. Asks: \"Am I a fool? Am I imagining things? Or am I right to follow my instinct?\"\n11. Seeking spiritual discernment that \"cannot be bought\"\n\n**Assessment factors:**\n\nPOSITIVE:\n- Radical honesty about mixed motives\n- Genuine spiritual seeking (not just political maneuvering)\n- Humility - admits he might be a fool\n- Shows he took risks to come (defied advisors)\n- Asks for help rather than demanding validation\n- The approach is unusual and memorable\n- Shows vulnerability and trust\n- Cardinal Orsini has lived through schisms and politics - genuine faith likely appeals to him\n- Age 18 - some allowance for youth and spiritual uncertainty\n- Good letters of recommendation establish credibility\n\nNEGATIVE/RISKY:\n- Describing \"visions\" and \"feelings\" could sound unstable\n- \"Always following this feeling\" - concerning to a rational churchman\n- Admitting advisors warned against it - might seem reckless\n- Asking if he's a \"fool\" - shows uncertainty that might worry them about entrusting crusade\n\n- Very vulnerable/exposed - could be seen as weak or confused\n- The \"feeling\" he describes is vague - not clear spiritual experiences\n- Could sound like mysticism without substance\n- Might worry them he's unstable or too young\n\nI see significant risks in Juan's approach. His vulnerability could be interpreted as weakness, and his vague spiritual experiences might raise suspicions. The church is particularly cautious about mystical claims, especially from a young person. While his honesty is compelling, it also exposes potential instability that could concern sophisticated church leaders like Cardinal Orsini.\n\nThe potential success hinges on Orsini's perception. Juan's previous letters and demonstrated intelligence work in his favor. His radical honesty might actually intrigue Orsini, who likely appreciates genuine spiritual seeking over performative piety. The journey's completion and his political acumen suggest maturity beyond his years.\n\nI assess this as a high-risk strategy with genuine potential. Success depends on Orsini detecting Juan's sincerity beneath the raw emotional disclosure. The approach is bold - revealing vulnerability could either deeply impress or completely undermine Juan's credibility.\n\nProbability Assessment: Cardinal Orsini Meeting\n\nYour Proposed Approach: Radical honesty about spiritual seeking, admitting you follow \"feelings\" and \"pulls\" you can't fully explain, asking if you're a fool, requesting the Pope's help in understanding your own prayers and discernment.\n\nMy Assessment: LIKELY TO SUCCEED (but with significant risk)\n\nFactors Supporting Success:\n\n1. Genuine Sincerity Will Show\nCardinal Orsini has spent decades in the Church and papal politics. He's assessed countless petitioners. Your approach is so vulnerable and honest that it's difficult to fake - he'll likely sense genuine spiritual seeking rather than calculated manipulation.\n\n2. Refreshing Honesty About Mixed Motives\nYou openly admit the worldly benefits (unite kingdom, solidify rule) while also revealing deeper spiritual questions. Most petitioners pretend pure motives. Your transparency could be disarming.\n\n3. Your Letters Establish Credibility\nSantiago, Toulouse, and especially Avignon have vouched for your intelligence and faith. You're not arriving as unknown quantity - you've been pre-validated by respected churchmen.\n\n4. Youth Provides Some Cover\nAt 18, there's allowance for spiritual uncertainty and seeking. An older king claiming to follow mysterious \"feelings\" would seem unstable. A young king genuinely wrestling with discernment seems... human.\n\n5. You Took Real Risks\nComing to Rome despite advisors' warnings, defying political prudence - this demonstrates the pull you describe is real to you, not just rhetoric.\n\n6. The Question Format\nAsking \"Am I a fool?\" rather than claiming certainty shows humility. You're seeking guidance, not demanding validation.\n\nSignificant Risks:\n\n1. The \"Feelings\" Language Is Dangerous\nDescribing following a \"pull\" or \"feeling\" you can't grasp could sound like dangerous mysticism. The Church in 1430 is wary of claims of private revelation - heresies often start this way.\n\n2. Admission of Uncertainty\nSaying advisors warned against this, asking if you're imagining things - this reveals doubt. Do they want to grant a crusade bull to someone who admits he might be foolish?\n\n3. Vagueness of Spiritual Experience\nYou describe \"glimpses\" and \"feelings\" but nothing concrete. Not visions, not voices, not clear guidance - just intuition. This is both more honest and more concerning.\n\n4. \"Always Following This Feeling\"\nCommitting to always follow something you can't explain or fully understand - this could worry a rational churchman. What if the \"feeling\" leads you astray?\n\n5. Possible Interpretation as Instability\nA less sympathetic listener might conclude: confused young king with delusions of divine guidance, dangerous to empower.\n\nWhy \"Likely to Succeed\" Rather Than Higher or Lower:\n\nNot \"High Probability\" because: The mystical language and admitted uncertainty create real risk. If Orsini thinks you're unstable or confused, this could end your petition immediately.\n\nNot \"Likely to Fail\" because: Your sincerity is likely genuine enough to come through, your credentials are strong, and sophisticated churchmen like Orsini often appreciate radical honesty over performative piety.\n\nThe key variables:\n\nHow you deliver this (tone, demeanor, body language)\n\nWhether Orsini perceives genuine seeking vs. confusion\n\nHis personal disposition toward mystical language\n\nHow much he trusts Cardinal de Foix's judgment\n\nWhat Success Looks Like:\n\nIf this works, Orsini will likely:\n\nBe moved by your vulnerability and honesty\n\nRecognize genuine spiritual seeking\n\nWant to help guide you\n\nAdvocate strongly for papal audience\n\nPerhaps offer spiritual counsel himself\n\nWhat Failure Looks Like:\n\nIf this fails, Orsini will likely:\n\nBecome concerned about your stability\n\nQuestion whether you're ready for crusade responsibility\n\nGently suggest you're too young/uncertain\n\nDeflect toward more time for spiritual maturity\n\nMy Recommendation:\n\nThis approach could create genuine connection with Cardinal Orsini IF delivered with the right balance of humility, intelligence, and sincerity. The vulnerability is both your greatest risk and greatest strength.\n\nCardinal Orsini is sophisticated enough to appreciate that genuine faith often includes doubt and seeking. But he also needs to believe you're capable of leading a crusade successfully.\n\nDo you proceed with this approach, Your Majesty? Or do you wish to modify it?"

This is exactly why Grenada is still holding out, no king has been able to unify the realm long enouth for the ten years it would take. Castille is a devout and pious nation as well. The problem is really uniting everyone under a common banner. If we can do that, we will grind them down like grain beneath a millstone. We have a strategy to take the western forts first and then gradually isolate and starve Grenada itself. The success of this campain would not hinge on a single battle with uncertain outcomes. It will be determined if Castille can muster the will to finally push through and stay united. This is exactly why papal support is crucial, without it I cannot hope to achieve much against Grenada.

He can't force Juan to reveal it, but he also can't just accept this without expressing concern. He would likely:\n1. Acknowledge he understands Juan's reasoning\n2. But express concern about Juan making major spiritual decisions without counsel\n3. Try to probe whether this is truly safe\n4. Possibly refuse or be very hesitant about absolution without knowing what Juan plans\n\nLet me write Fray Hernando's response - he should be troubled but also understanding of Juan's desire for purity of intention.\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\nThere's a long, heavy silence. You can hear the monk breathing on the other side of the screen.\n\n\"Your Majesty...\" His voice is strained. \"You're asking me to give you absolution and blessing without knowing what you plan to do. You ask if you sound like a madman. I will be honest: you sound like a young man walking a very dangerous line.\"\n\nHe shifts, clearly struggling. \"I understand your reasoning. You want to act with pure intention, untainted by counsel that might make it calculated. There is... nobility in that. But it also frightens me.\"\n\nA pause. \"As your confessor, I cannot force you to reveal what you will not reveal. The confessional is not an interrogation. But I also cannot simply bless an unknown action and say 'go with God.'\"\n\nHis tone becomes more gentle. \"You swear it will harm no one but yourself. You say it is spiritual and personal. You will do it before the Holy Father himself. These things... suggest you believe it is guided by something greater than yourself.\"\n\nAnother long silence. \"I will not refuse you confession. But I will say this: whatever you do, examine your heart in that very moment. Before you act, ask yourself one final time: 'Is this God's will or mine?' Promise me that much.\"\n\nDo you promise?"

Just the confessor speaking to the young king who is crying and asking the most important question.\n\nFray Hernando's Answer\n\nYou hear the monk's breath catch. Through the screen, you see him bow his head.\n\nWhen he speaks, his voice is thick with emotion.\n\n\"Your Majesty... my son... that is the question every believer asks. From the greatest saint to the humblest peasant. How do we know?\"\n\nHe's quiet for a moment. \"I told you once - when I pray, I struggle to quiet my own thoughts. Most of what I hear is my own mind chattering. But sometimes... sometimes there is clarity that feels like it comes from beyond myself. Peace that surpasses understanding. Or profound unease that won't let me rest.\"\n\nHis voice grows softer. \"The Church teaches us signs of true divine guidance: it brings humility, not pride. It serves others, not just ourselves. It aligns with Scripture and Church teaching. It brings peace, even when the path is hard. It makes us more charitable, more patient, more like Christ.\"\n\nA pause. \"False guidance - whether from the devil or our own ego - does the opposite. It puffs us up. It serves our ambitions while pretending piety. It brings anxiety disguised as certainty. It makes us harsh, judgmental, cruel in God's name.\"\n\nYou hear him shift closer to the screen.\n\n\"But Your Majesty, here is the hard truth: even with all these guidelines, we can still be wrong. We can mistake our will for God's. Saints have done it. Popes have done it. We are human, and we see through a glass darkly.\"\n\nHis voice becomes almost a whisper. \"So what do we do? We do our best to discern. We pray. We seek counsel. We examine our hearts. And then... we act. We choose.

It's also deeply symbolic in medieval Christian terms - echoing saints who gave up everything, kings who submitted to papal authority, and the ultimate Christian call to lay down one's life.\n\n**Factors Supporting Success:**\n\n1. **Unprecedented Drama**: Popes rarely see this. It's memorable, genuine, and impossible to fake this level of vulnerability.\n\n2. **Medieval Christian Symbolism**: This resonates deeply with Christian ideals of self-emptying (kenosis), submission to God, renunciation of worldly power. The Pope would understand these symbols profoundly.\n\n3. **The Sword Inscription**: \"Non Nobis Domine\" - Not unto us, Lord - perfectly aligns with the action. He's literally enacting the inscription.\n\n4. **Genuine Vulnerability**: An 18-year-old king, essentially naked before the Pope, offering everything. This is not political calculation - it's too risky, too extreme.\n\n5. **It Explains His Earlier Uncertainty**: All his talk of \"feelings\" and \"pulls\" now makes sense - he was building to THIS moment. The Pope would see the throughline.\n\n6. **Papal Authority Affirmed**: By asking \"Do you accept me?\" Juan is giving the Pope ultimate authority to validate (or reject) his calling. Popes appreciate being given power.\n\n7. **Legacy Appeal**: Pope Martin is dying. A young king who literally strips himself bare and offers everything in service to the Church? That's a story that would be told for centuries.\n\n**Factors Creating Risk:**\n\nThe performance carries significant potential for misinterpretation. An extreme act of submission might be seen as a sign of mental instability or political manipulation. The Pope could perceive this as a theatrical ploy rather than a genuine spiritual offering. Fray Hernando's visible concern might further complicate the moment, suggesting underlying doubts about Juan's true motivations. The unconventional nature of stripping before the Pope risks being viewed as disrespectful or even mad, potentially undermining Juan's sincere intentions.\n\nMedieval Christian traditions did respect dramatic acts of renunciation, but spontaneous, unscripted displays were considered highly irregular. The Pope, being politically astute and experienced, would likely analyze this gesture through multiple lenses - spiritual, psychological, and strategic. An 18-year-old's vulnerable display before an elderly religious leader creates an inherently uncomfortable dynamic that challenges traditional power structures and expectations.\n\nThe probability of success hinges on the profound symbolic power of complete vulnerability. By offering everything without reservation, the young king taps into deep medieval Christian narratives of submission and spiritual transformation. Yet the extreme nature of the act simultaneously risks being perceived as unhinged or manipulative.\n\nThe assessment ultimately lands on high probability of success, driven by the genuine emotional authenticity and perfect alignment with medieval Christian symbolic language. The potential for transformative impact outweighs the significant risks of misinterpretation.\n\nProbability Assessment: The Ultimate Offering\n\nYour Proposed Action: Strip yourself of crown, jewelry, and clothing before Pope Martin V, lay all worldly possessions at his feet including your father's sword, and offer yourself - body and soul - as a servant, asking if he accepts you.\n\nMy Assessment: HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS\n\nFactors Strongly Supporting Success:\n\n1. Unprecedented Medieval Christian Symbolism\n\nThis echoes St. Francis stripping naked before the Bishop of Assisi\n\nRecalls emperors submitting to popes (Henry IV at Canossa)\n\nEnacts the sword's own inscription: \"Non Nobis Domine\" - Not unto us, Lord\n\nMedieval Christianity deeply values renunciation, self-emptying, and submission to Church authority\n\nThis is the language Pope Martin V understands at a profound level\n\n2. It Explains Everything That Came Before\n\nAll your talk of \"feelings\" and \"uncertainty\" now makes perfect sense\n\nYou were building toward THIS moment\n\nThe Cardinal and Pope will see the throughline: the pull to Rome, retrieving the sword, all leading here\n\nYour genuine confusion about whether it was God's will becomes validated by the action itself\n\n3. Genuine Vulnerability Impossible to Fake\n\nAn 18-year-old king, essentially naked before the Pope and witnesses\n\nThis is too extreme, too risky to be political calculation\n\nThe physical vulnerability mirrors spiritual vulnerability\n\nYou're literally putting yourself at his mercy\n\n4. Affirms Papal Authority Maximally\n\nYou're not claiming God spoke to you directly\n\nYou're asking the Vicar of Christ to validate your calling\n\nYou're giving the Pope the power to accept or reject you\n\nThis positions him as the arbiter of God's will - exactly what popes want\n\n5. Legacy Appeal to a Dying Pope\n\nPope Martin is 72, thinking about what he'll be remembered for\n\nA young king who literally strips himself bare and offers everything in service to the Church?\n\nThat's a story that would echo through Church history for centuries\n\nIt makes Martin V the pope who received such profound submission\n\n6. The Practical/Spiritual Balance Resolved\n\nYou asked for worldly support (crusade bull) AND spiritual validation\n\nThis action shows you understand the spiritual is primary\n\nBut it also serves the practical goal (makes papal support more likely)\n\nYou've managed to be both genuinely holy AND strategically effective\n\n7. Medieval Theater\n\nPopes appreciate grand gestures and symbolic acts\n\nThis is memorable, dramatic, unprecedented\n\nIt creates a moment that will be recorded and remembered\n\nThe secretary is literally writing this down for history\n\nSignificant Risks:\n\n1. Shocking Impropriety\n\nStripping before the Pope is extremely unconventional\n\nSome might see it as theatrical madness\n\nIt breaks all normal protocols for papal audience\n\nCould be interpreted as disrespectful\n\n2. Questions of Mental Stability\n\nA king who does this spontaneously might seem unhinged\n\nCan they trust someone this impulsive with a crusade?\n\nThe Pope might think you're having a breakdown\n\n3. Fray Hernando's Visible Concern\n\nThe Pope will notice your confessor's troubled expression\n\nThis suggests even your spiritual guide worried about this\n\nCould undermine confidence in your judgment\n\n4. Physical Awkwardness\n\nAn 18-year-old in a loincloth is... potentially uncomfortable\n\nThe elderly Pope might find this disturbing rather than moving\n\nCaptain Fernán and others present might be horrified\n\n5. Too Extreme\n\nEven in medieval Christianity, this level of spontaneous renunciation without ritual framework is unusual\n\nYou didn't prepare the Pope for this\n\nHe might feel ambushed or manipulated\n\nWhy HIGH PROBABILITY Despite Risks:\n\nThe symbolism is TOO perfect for medieval Christianity:\n\nSelf-emptying (kenosis) is the core Christian virtue\n\nLaying everything at papal feet affirms Church authority\n\nThe physical act mirrors spiritual submission\n\nIt's exactly what saints and holy kings did\n\nPope Martin V's character supports this:\n\nHe's sophisticated enough to recognize genuine vulnerability\n\nHe's experienced enough to appreciate the theater\n\nHe's old enough to value legacy over cynicism\n\nHe's Church politician enough to see the usefulness\n\nThe context makes it work:\n\nYour whole journey built to this\n\nYour letters established your faith\n\nYour honesty with Orsini prepared them\n\nThe sword inscription provides perfect framing\n\nIt's too crazy to be calculated:\n\nNo advisor would recommend this\n\nFray Hernando clearly didn't know\n\nThe risk is too great for mere manipulation\n\nTherefore it reads as genuine inspiration\n\nWhat Success Looks Like:\n\nIf this works, Pope Martin will likely:\n\nBe deeply moved\n\nSee you as genuinely touched by grace\n\nGrant the crusade bull with enthusiasm\n\nBless you and your mission personally\n\nPerhaps even offer ongoing spiritual mentorship\n\nTell this story to others (enhancing your reputation)\n\nWhat Failure Looks Like:\n\nIf this fails, Pope Martin will likely:\n\nBe disturbed or alarmed\n\nQuestion your mental stability\n\nGently decline your request\n\nSuggest you need spiritual maturity before crusading\n\nPerhaps call for physicians or suggest rest\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nThis is HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS because the medieval Christian symbolism is so powerful, the vulnerability so genuine, and the legacy appeal so strong that Pope Martin V is likely to be moved rather than alarmed.\n\nBut understand: you are gambling EVERYTHING on this moment. If it fails, you've humiliated yourself before the Pope, stripped literally and figuratively, and destroyed your credibility.\n\nYour Majesty, you are about to enact this dramatic submission. Roll your dice:\n\nGreat Success\n\nSuccess\n\nFailure\n\nCatastrophic Failure\n\nThe fate of your reign may rest on this single moment."

During my reign, I have sometimes felt an urge, a pull, a feeling that drives me to something I feel I should do. I have learned to recognize it over time and it always involves an unconventional action, usually with great risk, and it always serves to bring the dream I mentioned earlier into this world. Coming here myself, for example, was something my advisors disliked. But I feel like this is where I was meant to be, right here right now.\"\n\nPope Martin V listens, his aged face attentive. Cardinal Orsini's expression is curious but guarded.\n\n\"When I left on my pilgrimage, I felt the urge again, this time to race back home to collect my father's sword and to uncover a plot from my own regency council. Maybe I was incredibly lucky to be there when the plot revealed itself, but either way, I was glad I acted on my feeling.\"\n\nYou reach down and carefully unclasp your sword without drawing it, holding it so the inscription catches the light.\n\n\"'Non Nobis Domine,' it reads. And as I came closer and closer to Rome, I got that same feeling again. My spiritual request made manifest, but this time father, what I must do seemed so unreal that I dare not share it with anyone, not even my confessor.\"\n\nBehind you, Fray Hernando stiffens. He suddenly understands what's about to happen. His face goes pale.\n\nYou lay the sword aside on a nearby table. The sound of steel on wood echoes in the chamber.\n\nThen you turn to face the Pope fully. You kneel.\n\nPope Martin V's eyes widen slightly as you remove your crown from your head and place it on the stone floor before you. The golden circlet of Castile and León gleams against the gray stone.\n\nCardinal Orsini leans forward, his mouth opening slightly.\n\nYou begin removing your rings - one, two, three - each one clicking softly as it joins the crown. Your chain of office. A pendant. All your jewelry accumulates in a small pile.\n\n\"Your Majesty—\" Captain Fernán starts behind you, alarm in his voice.\n\nBut you continue. Your hands move to your outer garments.\n\nYou had prepared for this. The clasps come loose easily. Your fine overtunic slides off your shoulders and joins the crown and jewels on the floor.\n\nThe secretary's quill has stopped moving. He stares, frozen.\n\nYour shirt follows. The cool air of the chamber touches your bare chest.\n\nFray Hernando's hand covers his mouth. His eyes are wide with shock and something else - recognition that this is what you wouldn't tell him in confession.\n\nYou stand briefly to remove your boots, your hose, your remaining outer garments. You fold them with deliberate care and place them with the rest.\n\nYou stand before the Pope in only your loincloth - an 18-year-old king, stripped of every symbol of royalty, every protection of rank, every shield of dignity.\n\nThe chamber is utterly silent except for your breathing and the distant sounds of Rome beyond the windows.\n\nPope Martin V has not moved. His aged hands grip the arms of his chair. His eyes - those sharp, political eyes that have seen everything in fifty years of Church service - are fixed on you with an intensity that seems to transcend his physical frailty.\n\nYou take the sword from the table. It feels heavier now, more significant. You hold it horizontal across your palms and lay it atop the pile of your worldly possessions - crown, jewels, clothes, weapon, all together.\n\nThen you sink to your knees. The stone floor is cold against your bare skin. You spread your arms wide in the ancient posture of supplication - cruciform, vulnerable, utterly exposed.\n\nYour voice rings out clearly in the chamber:\n\n\"Lord father! Look upon this mortal man who is full of sin but strives to live in your image. I lay everything I have at your feet. These are all my worldly possessions. My wealth, my crown, my clothes, my weapon and also my body and soul. These I offer in your service Lord and this is my spiritual request. My choice to come to Rome personally, my need to go back to fetch my father's sword and now my choice to offer it to you all. It has all led me to this.\"\n\nYou raise your eyes to meet the Pope's directly.\n\n\"Do you accept me as your servant, o Lord?\"\n\nThe Reactions\n\nThe Secretary:\nThe young priest has dropped his quill entirely. Ink spreads across his parchment unnoticed. He's staring with his mouth open, clearly witnessing something he never imagined he would see. His hands shake as he fumbles to retrieve his quill.\n\nCaptain Fernán:\nThe soldier has gone rigid, his face a mixture of shock, horror, and dawning understanding. His hand has moved instinctively toward his sword - the protective instinct of a guard - but he's frozen, realizing there's no threat to defend against. His eyes are wet. He's witnessing his king in a moment of profound vulnerability, and every military instinct screams that this is dangerous, yet something deeper tells him this is... holy.\n\nFray Hernando:\nThe monk has sunk to his own knees, tears streaming down his face. His lips move in silent prayer. All his concern, all his warnings, all his fear - it culminates in this. He sees now what you were trying to protect, what you knew would lose its purity if you spoke it aloud and received counsel. His face shows awe, terror, and profound spiritual recognition. This is what saints do. This is what the holy fools of Christ do. This is kenosis - complete self-emptying.\n\nCardinal Orsini:\nThe Cardinal's sophisticated political mask has cracked completely. He stares at you, then at the Pope, then back at you. His mouth works soundlessly. This is beyond politics, beyond strategy, beyond anything he prepared for. His hand makes the sign of the cross unconsciously. He's witnessing something that will be recorded in Church history, and he knows it.\n\nPope Martin V:\n\nThe elderly pontiff sits utterly still for a long moment that seems to stretch into eternity. His face has gone through shock, then something deeper - recognition, wonder, perhaps even fear of the divine moving through this moment.\n\nThen tears begin to fall down his aged cheeks.\n\nHis trembling left hand - the one that usually shakes with palsy - has gone completely still. He grips the arm of his chair with surprising strength as he pushes himself to stand.\n\nCardinal Orsini moves to help him but the Pope waves him away with unexpected vigor.\n\nPope Martin V rises to his full height. Despite his seventy-two years, despite his frailty, he seems suddenly larger, invested with the full weight of his office as Vicar of Christ.\n\nHe steps down from his chair and walks - slowly, with dignity - toward you.\n\nThe entire chamber holds its breath.\n\nThe Pope reaches the pile of your possessions. He looks down at them: the crown of Castile, the sword inscribed Non Nobis Domine, the simple garments of a pilgrim-king.\n\nThen he kneels.\n\nA gasp escapes from everyone present. The Pope - the Successor of Peter, Christ's Vicar on Earth - is kneeling on the stone floor beside a nearly naked young king.\n\nPope Martin V reaches out with both hands and lifts your father's sword. He holds it horizontal, reading the inscription, tears still flowing freely down his weathered face.\n\n\"Non Nobis Domine, sed nomini tuo da gloriam,\" he speaks the full verse from Psalm 115 in a voice that seems to grow stronger with each word. \"Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Your name give glory.\"\n\nHe turns to you, still kneeling at your level, eye to eye.\n\n\"Juan, King of Castile and León,\" his voice resonates with authority and emotion, \"in fifty years of service to Holy Church, We have seen much. Kings who petition for power. Princes who demand recognition. Lords who negotiate for advantage. All of them clothe their ambitions in piety while their hearts remain clothed in pride.\"\n\nHis voice breaks slightly. \"Never - never - have We seen this. This complete renunciation. This total offering. This... this is what Christ calls us to. 'Unless you become like children, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.' You have made yourself a child before God, before Us, before all assembled here.\"\n\nPope Martin V lifts the sword higher.\n\n\"This sword, inscribed by your father with words of humility, you bring to Us not demanding, not claiming divine right, but asking - asking if God will accept your service.\"\n\nThe Pope's voice rings out powerfully now, his frailty seemingly forgotten:\n\n\"We are Martin, Bishop of Rome, Successor of Peter, Vicar of Christ on Earth. We do not presume to speak for God in all things, for We too are merely His servant. But We are called to discern, to bless, to commission those whom the Spirit moves.\"\n\nHe looks directly into your eyes, and you see in his aged face something transcendent - not just the political animal who ended the Schism, but the priest, the shepherd, the guardian of souls.\n\n\"And We say to you: YES. We accept you as Christ's servant. We accept your offering. We accept your sword, your crown, your very self in service to the Gospel and to Holy Church.\"\n\nHe raises the sword and places the flat of the blade against your right shoulder, then your left - the gesture of knighting, but invested with far greater significance.\n\n\"Juan of Castile, We bless you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. We charge you: Go forth and bring the light of Christ to Granada. Unite your kingdom not for your own glory, but for God's. Wield this sword not for conquest, but for conversion. Wear this crown not as privilege, but as burden of service.\"\n\nPope Martin V's voice drops to something more intimate, almost gentle:\n\n\"You asked if We accept you as servant. Child, you are accepted. You are blessed. You are commissioned. And more - you are loved by the Church you have so profoundly honored today.\"\n\nThe Pope slowly stands, using the sword as support. He extends his hand to help you rise as well.\n\n\"Come, child. Stand. Clothe yourself again. Take back your crown, your sword, your kingship. But know that you take them back as instruments of divine service, blessed and sanctified by this moment of perfect renunciation.\"\n\nHe turns to Cardinal Orsini, his voice returning to its papal authority:\n\n\"Cardinal Orsini, let it be recorded: We grant to Juan II of Castile and León a plenary crusade bull for the recovery and conversion of the Kingdom of Granada. Let all Christendom know that this young king has offered himself completely to God's service, and We commission him to complete the Reconquista in Christ's name.\"\n\nTo the secretary: \"Let this audience be recorded in full. Every detail. Future ages must know what occurred here this day.\"\n\nThe Pope hands you back your father's sword, then reaches down and lifts your crown. He places it back on your head himself - not you taking it back, but the Pope investing you with it anew.\n\n\"Non Nobis Domine,\" he says softly. \"Not unto us, Lord. Remember this always, Juan. Remember this moment when the weight of crown and sword grows heavy. You offered them freely. We give them back as sacred trust.\"\n\nHe embraces you - Pope Martin V embracing a nearly naked young king - and whispers in your ear so only you can hear:\n\n\"God is with you, child. We saw His hand in this moment. Do not doubt what you have done here. This was... this was grace.\"\n\nThe Aftermath of the Moment\n\nBehind you, Fray Hernando is weeping openly, his shoulders shaking with sobs of relief, awe, and spiritual overwhelm.\n\nCaptain Fernán has gone to one knee, his hand over his heart, tears on his scarred soldier's face.\n\nCardinal Orsini stands with both hands covering his face, whether in prayer or simply overcome, it's impossible to tell.\n\nThe secretary writes furiously, trying to capture everything, his hand trembling so hard the words are barely legible.\n\nPope Martin V steps back, still holding your hands, looking at you with an expression of profound tenderness mixed with something like wonder.\n\n\"Dress yourself, child,\" he says gently. \"Then We will speak of practical matters - the crusade bull's terms, the resources We can provide, the letters We will write on your behalf. But those are mere details compared to what has happened here.\"\n\nHe turns to address the entire chamber, his voice carrying papal authority:\n\n\"Let all present bear witness: God has moved in this chamber today. We have seen true faith, true renunciation, true offering of self. This is what it means to be a Christian king. This is what it means to serve Christ through the crown.\"\n\nThe Pope returns to his chair, suddenly seeming his seventy-two years again, exhausted by the intensity of the moment. But his eyes remain fixed on you with warmth and blessing.\n\n\"Come, Juan of Castile. Clothe yourself and let us speak as father to son, as Peter's successor to Christ's servant king.\"\n\nYour Majesty, you have achieved something unprecedented. Pope Martin V has not merely granted your request - he has been profoundly moved, has blessed you personally, has commissioned you as a crusader, and has ensured this moment will be recorded for all time.\n\nWhat do you do or say now?"

You buckle your father's sword back at your side. The weight of it feels both familiar and entirely new.\n\nBut when you reach for your rings and jewelry, you pause. You gather them in your hands - gold, precious stones, symbols of wealth and status - and turn to Captain Fernán.\n\nThe soldier is still on one knee, his face wet with tears. He looks up as you approach.\n\n\"Captain, I have no need anymore for these trinkets. Better to put them to use in the crusade.\"\n\nYou place the jewelry in his weathered hands. The Captain stares at the gold and gems, then at you, his voice thick with emotion.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I... I have served kings before. I never...\" He can't finish the sentence. He simply closes his hands around the jewelry and nods, understanding.\n\nYou leave your crown on - the Pope himself placed it back on your head. That is different.

Sole command: This is actually fairly reasonable and has precedent. The Pope would likely agree but with caveats about Church oversight.\n\n2. Commitment until victory: This is problematic - \"until victory\" could mean decades. The Pope would likely soften this.\n\n3. Military Orders: Very tricky. The Orders are semi-autonomous and politically entangled. The Pope can encourage but not command them without causing issues.\n\n4. Crusade tax: Standard for crusade bulls, though the Church usually gets a cut.\n\n5. Vatican resources: The Pope would offer some support but the Vatican's finances in 1430 are not unlimited.\n\nThe Pope has been deeply moved by Juan's offering, but he's still a practical politician. He'd grant much but not everything, and would negotiate carefully. This should be a dialogue, not just a yes/no response.\n\nI should make this feel like a real negotiation between two people who now have genuine spiritual connection but also practical concerns.\n\nPope Martin V's Response\n\nThe Pope listens carefully, his fingers drumming slowly on the arm of his chair. Cardinal Orsini leans down to whisper something, but Martin waves him quiet.\n\n\"Sole command,\" the Pope repeats. \"You understand what you ask? The Military Orders, the great noble houses - many will resist a young king claiming absolute authority over them, even with papal blessing.\"\n\nHe pauses, studying you. \"But you are right. Divided command has poisoned every crusade in living memory. The Hussite disasters prove this daily.\"\n\nHe nods slowly. \"Very well. The bull will name you Supreme Commander of the Crusade, with full authority to appoint and dismiss subordinate commanders. All who take the cross must swear obedience to you in matters of the crusade. This We can grant.\"\n\n\"However,\" he raises a finger, \"the bull will also name a Papal Legate - a cardinal or archbishop - to accompany the crusade. Not to command militarily, but to ensure spiritual discipline, hear confessions, prevent... excesses. You understand?\"\n\nHe means atrocities, forced conversions, the kind of brutality that has stained previous crusades.\n\n\"The Legate reports to Us, not to you.

You will have input on the selection if you wish.\"\n\nHe settles back. \"Now, your second request: a general call for Christians to join or support, with commitment until victory.\"\n\nThe Pope nods. \"Standard crusade language.

Those who take the cross receive the usual indulgences - remission of temporal punishment for confessed sins, protection of property while on crusade, suspension of debts and legal proceedings. In return, yes, they commit until the campaign concludes or you release them from their vows.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"But Juan, understand - we can write that in the bull, but enforcement is your burden.

What would the Pope realistically say?\n- He can order them to participate\n- But he knows the political reality is messy\n- He might express concern about their current leadership/loyalties\n- He might offer to help but acknowledge limitations\n- He might suggest reforms or changes to leadership\n- He would want to appear authoritative while being realistic\n\nLet me craft a response that's true to the medieval political reality while moving the conversation forward.\n\nPope Martin V on the Military Orders\n\nThe Pope's expression becomes thoughtful, almost troubled.\n\n\"The Military Orders are technically under papal authority. They were founded to fight for the Church, and We can command them to take up the cross for Granada.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his words carefully.\n\n\"But you know as well as We do that the reality is more complicated. The Masters are chosen by political influence, not spiritual merit. They have vast estates, their own armies, their own treasuries. They have become... kingdoms within your kingdom.\"\n\nCardinal Orsini speaks up: \"Your Majesty, the Master of Santiago - Luis de Guzmán - is he not allied with the Infantes de Aragón?\"\n\nYou nod. The Pope makes a small sound of understanding.\n\n\"There is the problem,\" Martin says. \"We can write in the bull that Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara must commit their forces to your crusade under your command. We can threaten excommunication for refusal. But if the Master of Santiago uses the crusade as opportunity to undermine you...\"\n\nHe spreads his aged hands. \"The bull gives you authority. But authority on parchment must become authority in practice. That is your work, not Ours.\"\n\nThe Pope leans forward. \"However, We can do this: The bull will explicitly state that the Orders serve under your supreme command, that their Masters have no independent authority during the crusade. If they disobey, they disobey a papal directive. That gives you leverage.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"And if you find the current Masters... unsuitable for this holy work, We might be persuaded to investigate their fitness for office. Masters can be removed by papal authority if they prove unworthy.\"\n\nA subtle offer of political support.\n\nHow do you respond?"

You wish to levy special taxation to fund the campaign.\"\n\nCardinal Orsini clears his throat. \"Your Holiness, this is standard for crusade bulls. A portion of Church revenues can be redirected, indulgences can be sold, special tithes authorized.\"\n\n\"We know what is standard, Cardinal,\" the Pope says mildly. He looks at you. \"Yes, the bull will authorize special taxation. Church properties in Castile will contribute - say, one-tenth of their annual revenues for the duration of the crusade. We will also authorize the sale of indulgences to fund the campaign.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"But Juan, be careful with this power. Heavy taxation breeds resentment. The nobles will resist. Even the Church will grumble if pushed too hard. Use this authority wisely, not rapaciously.\"\n\n\"I understand, Holy Father.\"\n\n\"Good.\" The Pope takes a slow breath. \"Now, you asked what resources the Vatican itself will commit.\"\n\nHe exchanges a long look with Cardinal Orsini before answering.\n\n\"The papal treasury is... not what it once was. Decades of schism, rebuilding Roman authority, the Hussite crusades draining funds...\" He spreads his hands. \"We cannot send you armies or vast sums of gold.\"\n\nHe leans forward. \"But We can offer this: Twenty thousand florins from the papal treasury as seed money for your crusade. Letters to every Catholic monarch endorsing your campaign and requesting their support. Diplomatic pressure on Aragon - We will write to King Alfonso, making clear the Church expects him to support, not hinder, your crusade.\"\n\nThe Pope's voice strengthens. \"And this, which may be most valuable: We will send you sacred relics for your campaign standard. A fragment of the True Cross. A bone of Saint James himself from Compostela. When your army marches, it marches under the most holy symbols of Christendom.\"\n\nHe watches your reaction. \"Are these resources sufficient, or do you require more from Us?\"\n\nHow do you respond?"

He decides to wear all-white garments that he won't clean beyond hygiene — stains of mud, blood, and dust will remain as honest testimony to how holy service marks a man.

The crusade bull 'Inter Cetera Divinae Providentiae' is reviewed and approved, containing provisions for sole command, crusade taxation, Military Order reform, and terms for Granada after conquest.",

If they leave Rome by August 5-7, do the Italian city visits (2 weeks), sail to Barcelona (2 weeks), that puts them in Barcelona by early September. Then Barcelona to Seville (2-3 weeks) would get them there by late September/early October.\n\nSo yes, there's time, but it's getting tighter. The captain would note this is cutting it closer than the direct route.\n\nI should have Captain Fernán respond with the timeline assessment, and bring in Sir Thomas's perspective since Juan invited him to the council.\n\nIncluding Sir Thomas Beaumont\n\n\"Sir Thomas,\" you call toward the door. \"Join us, please.\"\n\nThe English knight enters, looking surprised but honored. \"Your Majesty?\"\n\n\"You've traveled with us, fought beside us, witnessed what happened today. I value your counsel. Sit.\"\n\nSir Thomas takes a seat, nodding respectfully to the Captain and Fray Hernando. You explain your proposal: Florence, Pisa, then ship to Barcelona, then sail to Seville.\n\nCaptain Fernán's Timeline Assessment\n\nThe Captain pulls out his small notebook, calculating.\n\n\"Florence and Pisa, then Barcelona... let me work this out, Majesty.\"\n\nHe sketches rough distances. \"We're in Rome now, early August once we have the bull. Florence is six to seven days north by horse. Pisa another two days west from there. That's nine days of riding plus time in each city.\"\n\nHe continues: \"Say three days in Florence, two in Pisa - that's two weeks total for the Italian portion. Then we need a ship from Pisa to Barcelona... that's sailing west across the Mediterranean, perhaps five hundred miles. Could be ten days to two weeks if wind cooperates, longer if it doesn't.\"\n\n\"Time in Barcelona?\" you ask.\n\n\"If you're visiting, at least three or four days to make it worthwhile. Then Barcelona to Seville by sea is another six hundred miles, two to three weeks.\"\n\nHe tallies it up. \"Best case: six weeks total from leaving Rome to reaching Seville. That puts us there in mid to late September. The council is November eighth, so yes, there's time.\"\n\nHe looks up. \"But Your Majesty, that's best case. Any delays - bad weather, ship problems, longer city visits - and we're cutting it very close.\"\n\nSir Thomas's Perspective\n\nThe English knight speaks up. \"May I offer a thought, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\"Please.\"\n\n\"I've campaigned in France and sailed these waters. The Mediterranean in late summer can be unpredictable. But I think the Captain's timeline is sound if we move efficiently.\"\n\nHe leans forward. \"However, there's another consideration: Florence and Pisa are rivals. They're often at odds. Visiting both requires... delicate diplomacy. You can't show favor to one without offending the other.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"Barcelona, though - that's the real prize, isn't it? It's King Alfonso's city, your Infantes' brother's seat of power. Arriving there with the Pope's crusade bull, showing yourself as blessed crusader...\" He grins. \"That sends a message to the Infantes that they can't ignore.\"\n\nWhat does Fray Hernando think?\n\nThe monk has been quiet, listening. Now he speaks.\n\nWhat is Fray Hernando's counsel on this plan?"

The practical wisdom of it\n\nGiven his character - thoughtful, concerned about distinguishing God's will from personal ambition, but also supportive of Juan when he sees genuine service - I think he would offer nuanced counsel.\n\nFray Hernando's Counsel\n\nThe monk sets down his wine cup and looks at you seriously.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I see the strategic value. Florence and Pisa are wealthy, their bankers could fund your crusade. Barcelona is a statement to the Infantes. All of this makes political sense.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"But I must ask: Why do you want to do this? Is it because you feel called to spread the crusade message? Or because you're... delaying your return to Castile?\"\n\nHis tone is gentle but probing. \"You've just had the most profound spiritual experience of your life. Part of me wonders if you're seeking to extend this moment - traveling in triumph with the Pope's blessing - rather than facing the hard reality waiting at home.\"\n\nHe leans forward. \"The Infantes are working against you. Don Álvaro holds what he can, but he needs you there. Every week you delay is a week they use to undermine your authority.\"\n\n\"But,\" he continues, \"if you truly believe visiting these cities serves the crusade, serves God's purpose - if it's not just avoidance - then yes, there's time.

Since I have recieved the bull and am charged with the reconquista, I feel like I should wear something symbolic. Or carry something with me that is recognizable from a distance. I have already committed to not wear and gold except from my crown, and I would like to have this somehow represented. Would it be appropriate for me to dress in all-white?

White for purity, for the crusade, for your renunciation of worldly wealth. Very striking. Men would recognize your standard from across a battlefield.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"But practically - white is difficult. Armor gets muddy, bloodstained, tarnished. Keeping it white requires constant maintenance. In campaign, that's... challenging.\"\n\nHe considers further. \"However, the Military Orders do it. The Templars wore white mantles with red crosses. Santiago wears red crosses on white. It's associated with holy warfare. If you're willing to accept the maintenance burden, it could work.\"\n\nSir Thomas Adds\n\n\"In France, I saw nobles who adopted distinctive colors for their retinues,\" the English knight says. \"It builds recognition and loyalty. Your men would wear your white, carry your white banners. In battle, they'd rally to that standard.\"\n\nHe nods slowly. \"And Your Majesty, after what you did today - stripping yourself of gold and jewels - white seems fitting. It says: I am pure in purpose, I serve God, not Mammon.\"\n\nFray Hernando's Perspective\n\nThe monk is quiet for a long moment, his expression thoughtful.\n\n\"Your Majesty, white in Christian symbolism represents purity, righteousness, resurrection. Christ appeared in white. Angels wear white. The saints are clothed in white.\"\n\nHe pauses, his tone becoming more careful. \"But that is precisely why you must be cautious. To clothe yourself in white, to present yourself as pure and righteous... this could be seen as humility - or as extraordinary pride.\"\n\nHe leans forward. \"The question is the same one we always ask: Why do you want to do this? Is it to remind yourself of your vow of renunciation? To inspire others to holiness? Or is it to set yourself apart, to appear more holy than others?\"\n\nHis eyes are kind but searching. \"What's in your heart when you imagine yourself in white armor?\"\n\nHow do you answer him?"

He's silent for a long moment, then slowly nods.\n\n\"That... that transforms everything, Your Majesty.\" His voice is thick with emotion. \"Not white claiming purity, but white bearing the stains of service. Not pretending to be unstained, but showing honestly how the work stains you.\"\n\nHe stands, agitated in the way he gets when spiritually moved. \"Yes. Yes, this is right. It's the opposite of pride. It's a visible reminder - to you and everyone who sees you - that even holy work is done by imperfect humans in an imperfect world.\"\n\nHe looks at you intently. \"The pristine white would be a lie. The stained white is the truth. You serve God, but you do it with muddy boots and bloody hands. That's... that's what Christian kingship actually looks like.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán's Approval\n\nThe soldier grins. \"And practically, Your Majesty, this solves my concern. You're not trying to maintain impossible purity - you're wearing the campaign's reality. After your first battle, that white will be stained with dust and blood, and you'll keep wearing it. That's powerful.\"\n\nHe nods firmly. \"Soldiers will understand that immediately. You're not some pristine saint who doesn't get dirty. You're in it with them, bearing the same stains they bear.\"\n\nSir Thomas's Perspective\n\nThe English knight speaks thoughtfully. \"In heraldry, we'd call this a 'proper' representation - showing things as they truly are rather than idealized. Your white shows the ideal mission. The stains show the real struggle.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"And Your Majesty, there's something else. Every stain will have a story. That mud from the siege of such-and-such castle. That blood from the battle at wherever. The stains become... a record of the crusade itself.\"\n\nFray Hernando's Warning\n\nThe monk sits back down, still moved but adding a note of caution.\n\n\"Your Majesty, commit to this fully. Because if you wear white and let it stain, then suddenly decide to have it cleaned because it looks too dirty or shameful... that breaks the whole meaning. The stains must be worn with the same pride as the white itself.\"\n\nHe looks at you seriously. \"Can you accept that? Can you stand before nobles in a stained, muddy tabard and not feel ashamed?\"\n\nHow do you respond?"

By this act of complete renunciation and offering, he has shown himself worthy to be called a true soldier of Christ and a faithful son of the Church.\n\nMoved by the Holy Spirit and recognizing the sincere faith of this Our son, and considering the great work yet undone in the Iberian lands where the Crescent still holds sway over territories that rightfully belong to the Cross, We have determined to grant those favors and authorities herein described.\n\n---\n\n## Article I: Proclamation of Crusade\n\n**BY THE AUTHORITY OF ALMIGHTY GOD**, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by Our own authority as Vicar of Christ on Earth, **WE DO HEREBY PROCLAIM AND DECREE**:\n\nA plenary and universal **CRUSADE** against the Moorish Kingdom of Granada, for the recovery of Christian lands unjustly held, for the liberation of souls dwelling in the darkness of false belief, and for the completion of that sacred Reconquista begun by the faithful kings of Spain in ages past.\n\nThis Crusade is declared to be a work of supreme spiritual merit, undertaken not for earthly gain but for the greater glory of God and the salvation of souls. All who participate with pure hearts shall be accounted among the blessed warriors of Christ.\n\n---\n\n## Article II: Supreme Command\n\n**WE DO APPOINT AND COMMISSION** Our beloved son Juan, King of Castile and León, as **SUPREME COMMANDER** of this Holy Crusade, with full, complete, and exclusive authority over all military operations, strategic decisions, and temporal governance of crusading forces.\n\n**This authority includes, without limitation:**\n\n1. **Command of All Forces**: All Christian forces engaged in this Crusade, whether royal armies, feudal levies, forces of the Military Orders, foreign knights, or any other armed Christians, shall be under the sole command of King Juan. No lord, prince, master, or commander may refuse his lawful orders or pursue independent military action.\n\n2. **Appointment and Dismissal**: The Supreme Commander may appoint subordinate commanders, captains, and officers as he deems necessary for the prosecution of the Crusade, and may dismiss any such officers for cause. He may reorganize military structures as required for effective command.\n\n3. **Strategic Authority**: All decisions regarding campaigns, sieges, battles, truces, terms of surrender, and military strategy rest solely with the Supreme Commander. No council, assembly, or individual may override his military judgment.\n\n4. **Discipline and Justice**: The Supreme Commander has authority to maintain military discipline, to judge military offenses, and to punish violations of crusading vows or military orders according to canon law and the laws of war.\n\n**Any Christian who refuses the lawful commands** of the Supreme Commander in matters pertaining to this Crusade, or who pursues independent military action contrary to his orders, shall be subject to ecclesiastical censure including possible excommunication, and shall forfeit all crusading indulgences and privileges.\n\n---\n\n## Article III: The Military Orders\n\nThe venerable **Military Orders of Santiago, Calatrava, and Alcántara**, founded for the defense of Christendom and the prosecution of holy war against the enemies of Christ, are hereby commanded and required to commit their full strength to this Crusade.\n\n**WE DO DECREE:**\n\n1. The Masters of these Orders shall place their forces under the Supreme Command of King Juan for the duration of this Crusade.\n\n2. The Orders shall provide knights, men-at-arms, supplies, and financial support as determined necessary by the Supreme Commander.\n\n3. The Orders retain their internal discipline and religious observances, but in all military matters they serve as integral components of the crusading army under unified command.\n\n4. Should any Master prove unworthy, disobedient, or unsuited to this holy work, We reserve the right to investigate and, if necessary, remove said Master and appoint a successor more fitting for the prosecution of God's work.\n\nThe Military Orders are reminded that their original purpose was precisely this: to fight for the Cross against the Crescent. This Crusade returns them to their sacred founding mission.\n\n---\n\n## Article IV: Call to Christendom\n\n**WE DO CALL UPON** all faithful Christians, noble and common, clergy and laity, to support this holy endeavor according to their abilities:\n\n**To Knights and Men-at-Arms**: Take up the cross and join this sacred campaign. Your swords are needed for Christ's work.\n\n**To Lords and Nobles**: Provide men, supplies, and financial support. Lead your retinues in holy service.\n\n**To Merchants and Craftsmen**: Support the Crusade with your skills and resources. Just profit from supplying Christ's army carries no shame.\n\n**To Clergy**: Preach this Crusade, encourage the faithful, pray for victory, and accompany the armies as chaplains.\n\n**To All the Faithful**: Even those who cannot take the cross personally may support through prayer, alms, and financial contributions.\n\n**Those who take the crusading vow commit themselves** until the Kingdom of Granada is conquered and converted, or until the Supreme Commander releases them from their vows. This is not a seasonal campaign but a sustained effort that may require years of service.\n\n---\n\n## Article V: Indulgences and Privileges\n\n**TO ALL WHO TAKE THE CROSS** in this holy Crusade, We grant the following spiritual benefits and temporal protections:\n\n### Spiritual Benefits:\n\n1. **Plenary Indulgence**: Full remission of temporal punishment due for all sins properly confessed with sincere contrition. This indulgence applies both to those who serve personally in the crusading army and to those who support the Crusade financially according to their means.\n\n2. **Remission of Penances**: All ecclesiastical penances imposed for past sins are remitted for those who serve faithfully in this Crusade.\n\n3. **Special Intercession**: Daily prayers shall be offered in churches throughout Christendom for the success of this Crusade and for the souls of crusaders living and dead.\n\n4. **Martyrdom**: Those who die in the service of this Crusade, having confessed their sins and received the sacraments, shall be accounted as martyrs for the faith, and We have every confidence that God shall receive their souls with mercy.\n\n### Temporal Protections:\n\n1. **Protection of Property**: All property, lands, and goods of crusaders are placed under the protection of Holy Church for the duration of their service. Any who unjustly seize crusader property during their absence shall be excommunicated.\n\n2. **Suspension of Debts**: Interest on debts owed by crusaders shall not accrue during their service. Creditors may not foreclose on crusader property during their absence.\n\n3. **Legal Immunity**: Legal proceedings against crusaders are suspended for the duration of their service, save for the most serious crimes against God and man.\n\n4. **Safe Conduct**: Crusaders traveling to and from the campaign are granted safe conduct through all Christian lands. Those who harm or impede crusaders in their travels shall face ecclesiastical censure.\n\n---\n\n## Article VI: Crusade Taxation\n\nTo provide the necessary resources for this sacred undertaking, **WE DO AUTHORIZE** the following taxation:\n\n1. **Church Revenues**: All ecclesiastical properties, monasteries, bishoprics, and church foundations within the Kingdom of Castile shall contribute one-tenth of their annual revenues to the Crusade for its duration.\n\n2. **Sale of Indulgences**: Indulgences may be purchased by those unable to serve personally, with all proceeds directed to the Crusade treasury. These indulgences shall be sold at fair rates determined by the Papal Legate in consultation with the Supreme Commander.\n\n3. **Special Tithes**: The Supreme Commander may, with the approval of the Papal Legate, levy additional tithes on the realm as necessary to sustain the campaign, provided such taxation is not oppressive and is applied justly.\n\n4. **Foreign Contributions**: We call upon the faithful throughout Christendom to contribute financially to this Crusade. Collection boxes shall be placed in churches, and special appeals made for donations.\n\n**All funds raised for this Crusade** must be used for its stated purposes: military operations, supplies, payment of soldiers, care of wounded, and related expenses. Any who embezzle or misuse crusade funds shall be excommunicated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of canon law.\n\n---\n\n## Article VII: Papal Legate and Spiritual Oversight\n\nTo ensure that this Crusade remains true to its spiritual purposes and is conducted in accordance with Church teaching and canon law, **WE SHALL APPOINT** a Papal Legate to accompany the crusading forces.\n\n**The duties of the Papal Legate include:**\n\n1. **Spiritual Guidance**: Ensuring that the crusading army maintains proper spiritual discipline, receives regular sacraments, and conducts itself in a manner befitting soldiers of Christ.\n\n2. **Prevention of Excesses**: Monitoring military operations to prevent unnecessary cruelty, forced conversions at sword-point, desecration of holy places (even Muslim ones that may contain sacred objects), and other acts contrary to Church teaching.\n\n3. **Pastoral Care**: Hearing confessions, celebrating Mass, administering sacraments, providing spiritual counsel to crusaders, and attending to the spiritual needs of the army.\n\n4. **Judgment of Spiritual Matters**: Deciding questions of canon law, determining whether military actions comply with Church teaching on just war, and resolving disputes involving ecclesiastical jurisdiction.\n\n5. **Communication with Rome**: Reporting regularly to the Apostolic See on the progress of the Crusade, the conduct of forces, and any matters requiring papal attention.\n\n**The Legate has no military command** and may not override the Supreme Commander's decisions regarding military operations, strategy, or tactics. However, if the Legate believes a proposed action violates Church teaching or canon law, he must voice his concerns and may appeal to Us for guidance.\n\n**The Supreme Commander and the Papal Legate** are to work in cooperation, each respecting the other's sphere of authority. The military serves the spiritual purpose; the spiritual guides the military conduct.\n\n---\n\n## Article VIII: Treatment of Granada and Its People\n\nThis Crusade is undertaken for the **conversion of souls and the recovery of Christian territory**, not for vengeance or worldly conquest alone. Therefore:\n\n1. **Offer of Peaceful Conversion**: Before military action, the rulers of Granada should be offered terms: Accept Christian baptism, submit to Castilian sovereignty, and receive protection of life and property. Those who convert willingly shall be welcomed as brothers in Christ.\n\n2. **Protection of Converts**: Any Muslim who accepts baptism, whether before or during the conquest, shall receive full protection of person, family, and reasonable property. Forced conversion at sword-point is forbidden. Conversion must be of the heart, even if circumstances encourage it.\n\n3. **Treatment of the Conquered**: When cities or fortresses are taken, unnecessary slaughter is forbidden. Women, children, the elderly, and non-combatants should be protected from harm. The laws of war as understood by Church teaching must be observed.\n\n4. **Disposition of Property**: Conquered lands become the property of the Crown of Castile to be distributed as the King deems appropriate. However, properties of churches, monasteries, and religious foundations (even if currently Muslim) should be preserved where possible for conversion to Christian use.\n\n5. **The Ultimate Goal**: The goal is not to create a realm of resentful false converts, but to bring the light of Christ to Granada through a combination of military necessity, political wisdom, and genuine evangelization. The sword opens the door; the Gospel must enter through it.\n\n---\n\n## Article IX: Vatican Support\n\nFrom the resources of the Apostolic See, **WE DO PROVIDE**:\n\n1. **Financial Support**: Twenty thousand florins from the papal treasury as immediate seed funding for this Crusade.\n\n2. **Sacred Relics**: A fragment of the True Cross and a bone of Saint James (Santiago) himself, to be carried with the crusading army as signs of divine favor and protection.\n\n3. **Letters to Christian Monarchs**: We shall write to the kings of France, England, Portugal, Aragon, Navarre, and other Christian realms, endorsing this Crusade and requesting their support or at minimum their non-interference.\n\n4. **Diplomatic Pressure**: We shall communicate with King Alfonso V of Aragon, making clear that the Church expects the Crown of Aragon to support, not hinder, this holy work. The Infantes de Aragón residing in Castile should align themselves with this Crusade rather than pursuing factional interests.\n\n5. **Prayers and Masses**: Special prayers for the success of this Crusade shall be said throughout Christendom. We Ourselves shall continue to pray daily for King Juan and for the conversion of Granada.\n\n---\n\n## Article X: Duration and Conclusion\n\nThis Crusade is declared **until the Kingdom of Granada is fully conquered and its conversion to Christianity is secured**, or until We or Our successors determine that the objective has been achieved or should be modified.\n\nVictory shall be marked by:\n- The fall of Granada's capital and submission of its rulers\n- The conversion of its mosques to churches\n- The establishment of Christian governance throughout the territory\n- A population either converted to Christianity or living peacefully under Christian rule\n- The celebration of a Te Deum in the Great Mosque of Granada, rededicated as a cathedral\n\nUpon achieving these goals, the Supreme Commander may petition Us or Our successor for formal conclusion of the Crusade and release of all crusading vows.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion and Exhortation\n\nWe have witnessed in Our own presence a young king who offered everything - crown, wealth, even the very clothes upon his back - in service to God. This act of profound humility and complete submission moves Us to grant this bull with confidence that it shall be used not for worldly ambition but for God's glory.\n\n**To Juan, King of Castile**: Remember always the moment you knelt before Us. Let the inscription on your father's sword guide you: *Non Nobis Domine* - Not unto us, O Lord. Victory, if it comes, belongs to God alone.\n\n**To all who participate**: You are soldiers of Christ, not mere warriors seeking plunder. Fight with courage but also with mercy. Be as fierce as lions against God's enemies, but as gentle as lambs toward those who seek baptism and peace.\n\n**To the faithful everywhere**: Support this holy work with your prayers, your alms, and your service. The Reconquista, begun centuries ago, may in our time be completed. That would be a blessing beyond measure.\n\nMay Almighty God, in whose name this Crusade is undertaken, grant victory to Christian arms, conversion to Muslim hearts, and glory to His holy name.\n\n**Given at Rome, at Saint Peter's, in the year of the Incarnation of Our Lord one thousand four hundred and thirty, on the first day of August, in the thirteenth year of Our Pontificate.**\n\n---\n\n## Attestation\n\n**We, Martin, by Divine Providence Pope, have signed this bull with Our own hand and ordered that it be sealed with the Fisherman's Ring and the leaden seal of the Apostolic See.**\n\n**Witnessed by:**\n- Giordano Cardinal Orsini, Cardinal-Deacon of San Giorgio in Velabro\n- Paolo Caraffa, Chamberlain of the Apostolic Palace\n- Multiple other curial officials\n\n---\n\n### [SPACE FOR PAPAL SEAL]\n\n*The great leaden seal (bulla) of Pope Martin V, bearing on one side the images of Saints Peter and Paul, and on the other the Pope's name, is affixed here by red and yellow silk cords.*\n\n---\n\n## Addendum: Special Provisions\n\n**Regarding the White Garments**: We note and bless King Juan's intention to wear white garments as symbol of his renunciation and service. Let these garments remain unstained by pride but bear honestly the stains of service - mud, blood, and dust of the campaign. This is fitting and proper.\n\n**Regarding Future Correspondence**: King Juan may write to Us at any time seeking guidance, reporting progress, or requesting interpretation of this bull's provisions. We remain his father in Christ, ready to counsel and support him.\n\n**Regarding Modifications**: Should circumstances require modification of these terms, such changes may be made only by Us or Our successors, after consultation with the Supreme Commander and the Papal Legate.\n\n---\n\n*Deo Gratias*\n\n**END OF BULL**\n\nI've created the complete Crusade Bull as a comprehensive document. Now I should have Cardinal Orsini present it to Juan in the scene and get his reaction and approval.\n\nReviewing the Complete Bull\n\nCardinal Orsini gestures to the magnificent parchment before you. \"The complete bull, Your Majesty. Every provision we discussed, formalized in proper ecclesiastical language.\"\n\nHe watches as you read through the Latin text, occasionally translating key passages. The weight of what's written is enormous - supreme command, authority over the Military Orders, taxation rights, papal financial support, the sacred relics.\n\nWhen you reach the section about your white garments, Cardinal Orsini smiles. \"His Holiness insisted on including that. He was moved by your intention to wear the stains of service.\"\n\nYou continue reading to the end. The addendum noting you may write to the Pope for guidance, the provision that only the Pope can modify these terms.\n\nCaptain Fernán leans over your shoulder, eyes widening. \"Your Majesty... this gives you everything. More than everything.\"\n\nCardinal Orsini nods. \"His Holiness rarely grants such comprehensive authority. But after what he witnessed yesterday...\" He trails off meaningfully.\n\nYour Majesty, do you approve this bull? Are there any changes you wish to request before the papal seal is affixed?"

The certainty itself isn't necessarily wrong, but the way Juan is expressing it - \"I just know it\" - echoes the very thing they've discussed about distinguishing God's will from his own conviction.\n\nCardinal Orsini might also react, though perhaps more carefully given his role.\n\nThis is an important character moment. Juan has achieved incredible success, received enormous authority, and now he's expressing the kind of confidence that could tip into dangerous certainty/pride. The NPCs should respond authentically to this.\n\nReactions to Your Certainty\n\nYour words hang in the air. Captain Fernán looks pleased, nodding with military confidence. But Fray Hernando's expression shifts.\n\nFray Hernando's Warning\n\nThe monk speaks carefully but firmly. \"Your Majesty... may I counsel you?\"\n\nYou turn to him. \"Of course, Father.\"\n\n\"You feel the same certainty now as when you knelt before the Pope. That concerns me.\" His voice is gentle but serious. \"What you did yesterday - that was one moment, one offering. You succeeded because you were humble, vulnerable, uncertain even.\"\n\nHe steps closer. \"But now you say 'I will succeed, I just know it.' That's...\" He pauses, choosing words carefully. \"Your Majesty, remember what we discussed. Certainty is not always from God. Sometimes it comes from our own will, our own desire dressed as faith.\"\n\nHe gestures to the bull. \"You have been given extraordinary authority. That is real. But success is not guaranteed simply because you feel certain. Granada is strong. The campaign will be hard. Noble, yes. Blessed, yes. But assured?\"\n\nFray Hernando shakes his head slightly. \"Guard your heart, Majesty. This is exactly the moment when pride creeps in - when everything is going well, when you've received great honors, when certainty feels like faith.\"\n\nCardinal Orsini's Perspective\n\nThe Cardinal adds more diplomatically: \"Your Majesty, His Holiness grants you the tools for success. But as the bull itself says - victory belongs to God alone. Non Nobis Domine.\"\n\nHe taps the parchment. \"Even with supreme command, papal backing, and sacred relics, the outcome rests in God's hands and in the choices you and others make. Certainty of purpose, yes. But certainty of outcome?\" He spreads his hands. \"That is for God to determine.\"\n\nHow do you respond to their concerns?"

From it, he carefully removes two ornate reliquaries - one gold, one silver, each about the size of a small book.\n\n\"The sacred relics His Holiness promised,\" he says reverently, placing them on the desk.\n\nHe opens the first - the gold reliquary. Inside, suspended in crystal, is a dark wooden fragment about the length of your thumb.\n\n\"A fragment of the True Cross,\" Cardinal Orsini says. \"Authenticated by the Church, kept in the Vatican treasury for three centuries. It has been carried in crusades before - to Jerusalem, to Constantinople. Now it goes to Granada.\"\n\nHe opens the silver reliquary. Inside, wrapped in silk, is a small bone - yellowed with age.\n\n\"A finger bone of Saint James the Greater, from Compostela. His Holiness requested it specifically from Santiago's treasury for this crusade. The saint who brought Christianity to Iberia will march with your army.\"\n\nBoth relics gleam in the afternoon light. The weight of their significance is palpable - not just objects, but symbols of divine authority and blessing.\n\n\"These will be placed in your battle standard,\" Cardinal Orsini says. \"When your army marches, they march under the True Cross and Santiago himself.\"\n\nWhat do you say or do?"

Tall windows. Tapestries depicting papal history. A great table of polished wood.\n\nPope Martin V sits at the head of the table in full papal regalia - white and gold vestments, the triple tiara on his head despite the summer heat. He looks exhausted but resolute.\n\nSeveral cardinals and officials line the walls as witnesses.

When he reaches the end, he nods.\n\n\"It is good. It is right. Let it be done.\"\n\nA clerk brings forward an elaborate writing set.

He presses it into red wax at the base of the document, leaving a clear impression.\n\n\"The ring of Peter blesses this work,\" he intones.\n\nFinally, Cardinal Orsini brings forward the great leaden seal - the bulla that gives the document its name. It's heavy, stamped with images of Saints Peter and Paul on one side, the Pope's name on the other. Red and yellow silk cords are threaded through it.\n\nWith ceremony, the seal is affixed to the parchment, hanging from the cords.\n\nPope Martin V stands with effort. The entire chamber stands with him.\n\n\"It is done,\" he declares, his voice carrying papal authority. \"Juan II of Castile is Supreme Commander of the Crusade for Granada, with all authority herein granted.

May He guard you from pride, sustain you through hardship, and bring you safely to the completion of this holy work.\"\n\nHis fingers tighten slightly on your head.\n\n\"May the example of Saint James guide you. May the sacrifice of Christ on the True Cross strengthen you. May the prayers of all the saints accompany you into battle.\"\n\nThe Pope's voice breaks slightly. \"And may We meet again, if not in this world, then in the next - where you will tell Us of Granada's conversion, and We will rejoice together before God's throne.\"\n\nHe leans down with effort and kisses your forehead - a tender, paternal gesture.\n\n\"Go with God, Our beloved son. You have moved an old man's heart more deeply than you know. We will pray for you daily until death takes Us. And after death...\" He smiles through tears. \"We will petition God Himself on your behalf.\"\n\nHe helps you rise, then embraces you fully.\n\n\"Non Nobis Domine,\" he whispers in your ear. \"Remember always. Not unto us, Lord.\"\n\nWhen he releases you, every person in the chamber has tears in their eyes - cardinals, officials, even the stoic guards.\n\n\"Now go,\" Pope Martin says, stepping back. \"Go and do what God has called you to do. We have faith in you, Juan of Castile. Complete faith.\"\n\nWhat do you say or do in this final moment with the Pope?"

This feels like a good place to summarize what's been accomplished and set the stage for the next phase - the journey through Italy and Barcelona before returning to Spain.\n\nThe Silent Farewell\n\nYou take Pope Martin V's aged hand in yours. His skin is thin, papery, his grip weak from seventy-two years of life. But his eyes - those sharp, intelligent eyes that have seen so much - meet yours directly.\n\nNo words. There are no words adequate for this moment.\n\nIn his eyes, you see blessing, hope, faith. Perhaps also fear - fear that he's sending a young man to possible death, fear that this might be his last great act before God calls him home.\n\nIn your eyes, he must see determination, purpose, gratitude. And perhaps the same fear reflected back - that this holy man who blessed you might not live to see your return.\n\nThe moment stretches. The entire chamber holds its breath.\n\nThen you release his hand, bow deeply one final time, and turn.\n\nYou walk toward the door. Your footsteps echo on the marble floor. Captain Fernán, Fray Hernando, and Sir Thomas fall in behind you.\n\nAt the threshold, you pause for just a heartbeat, glancing back.\n\nPope Martin V still stands there, one hand raised in final blessing, tears streaming down his weathered face.\n\nThen you step through the door and into the corridor beyond.\n\nGathering the Company\n\nBack at the monastery that evening, you assemble your entire party. All ten men gather in the common room as the sun sets over Rome.\n\nYou stand before them, the sealed crusade bull in its protective case, the reliquaries prepared by papal craftsmen - ready to be mounted on a banner staff.\n\n\"We leave at first light,\" you announce. \"Our destination: Florence. Then Pisa. Then we sail to Barcelona. And finally, home to Seville.\"\n\nYou gesture to the case. \"We carry the most precious cargo in Christendom. The Pope's crusade bull. A fragment of the True Cross. The bone of Saint James himself. These are not just objects - they are symbols of everything we fight for.\"\n\nYou look at each man in turn. \"Sergeant García, Corporal Rodrigo, Martín, Felipe - you four will guard these relics in rotating shifts. Never let them out of your sight. Your lives are less important than these items - do you understand?\"\n\nAll four men nod solemnly. \"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Captain Fernán will command our march. Fray Hernando will see to our spiritual needs. Sir Thomas and Peter provide additional swords and experience. Diego handles correspondence.\"\n\nYou pause. \"We ride as the Pope's chosen crusaders now. We carry his blessing and his authority. Act accordingly.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán steps forward. \"Your Majesty, I've acquired horses and supplies for the journey. We'll make good time to Florence - six or seven days if we push.\"\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"And Your Majesty, your white garments are ready. The tailor completed them this afternoon.\"\n\nSir Thomas grins. \"We ride under the banner of the True Cross tomorrow. That's something to tell my grandchildren - if I live to have any.\"\n\nThe mood is excited, purposeful. These men have witnessed something extraordinary in Rome, and now they're part of it.\n\n\"Rest tonight,\" you order. \"Tomorrow, we begin the work the Pope commissioned us to do.\"\n\nEvening in Rome - August 1, 1430\n\nThe sun sets over the Eternal City. Tomorrow begins the journey home - but first, through Florence, Pisa, and Barcelona, spreading word of the crusade and building support.\n\nYou stand at the monastery window, looking out over Rome's ancient rooftops. Your father's sword hangs at your side. The crusade bull rests secure nearby. The sacred relics wait to be mounted on your standard.\n\nEverything has changed. A month ago, you were a young king struggling to control a fractious realm. Now you are the Pope's chosen instrument, blessed and commissioned to complete the Reconquista.\n\nNon Nobis Domine, the sword's inscription reminds you. Not unto us, Lord.\n\nFray Hernando's voice comes from behind you. \"Your Majesty? It's late. You should rest before tomorrow's journey.\"\n\n\"In a moment, Father.\"\n\nYou take one last look at Rome - the city where everything changed. Where you knelt naked and afraid, and rose blessed and commissioned.\n\nTomorrow, Florence. Then the long road home.\n\nThe Roman chapter of your journey is complete. What lies ahead is the crusade itself.\n\nYour Majesty, this marks the end of Chapter 3. Shall we continue to Florence and the journey home, or would you like to pause here?"

Infante Juan rallies 15 nobles at Medina del Campo and sends propaganda letters portraying Juan as unstable. The revolt FAILS: only 23 nobles attend their unauthorized assembly at Burgos (expected 30-40); they seize Arévalo fortress and two minor castles but fail to take any major city; Segovia bluntly refuses entry. Álvaro de Luna holds Valladolid and the royal administration, with Juan's secret intelligence cabinet functioning effectively. When rumors of the papal bull reach Castile in August, wavering nobles abandon the Infantes entirely.

How would they act and what would they accomplish? They saw Juan enter into the first council when they revealed that they wanted to give the council more powers permanently, but were also threatened, a grave offence. Then the king left for real and was probably seen in Santiago and later when he passed through Navarre.\n\n\nWhat would be their objective and what would they do?"

          "text": "**What the Infantes Know:**\n1. Juan caught them red-handed discussing making the regency permanent\n2. Juan removed Infante Juan from the council but kept Enrique\n3. Juan threatened Infante Juan's life (\"I will remove more from you than just your council seat. Your head to be exact.\")\n4. Juan then left on \"pilgrimage\" - publicly to Santiago, then continuing east through France\n5. They saw him pass through Navarre (their territory) heading toward France\n6. The regency council continues with only 3 members (Enrique, Archbishop, Marquis) requiring unanimous decisions\n\n**What the Infantes Don't Know:**\n1. Juan went to Rome (though they might suspect given the French route)\n2. Juan obtained a crusade bull\n3. The full extent of Juan's plans\n4. That Juan has been building an intelligence network (the cabinet)\n\n**Their Situation:**\n- Infante Juan: Publicly humiliated, removed from council, threatened with death\n- Infante Enrique: Still on council but in awkward position\n- King Alfonso V of Aragon: Their brother, watching from Aragon\n- They have: estates in Castile, noble faction supporters, military forces\n- Time window: Several months while Juan is away\n\n**We Rolled That They WILL Revolt:**\nThe dice determined this happens despite \"likely to succeed\" probability of Juan's plan working. So something goes wrong enough that they take action.\n\n**What Would Their Objective Be?**\n\nI think they'd have several overlapping goals:\n1. **Primary**: Restore their position and authority - can't let the humiliation stand\n2. **Secondary**: Neutralize or remove Álvaro de Luna (the real target)\n3. **Tertiary**: Either control Juan through a regency structure OR replace him entirely\n \nI see the Infantes launching a strategic campaign to undermine Juan's authority. They'll use diplomatic channels to paint him as an unstable ruler, leveraging their noble connections and Alfonso V's potential support. Their goal is to create doubt about Juan's leadership, positioning themselves as more reasonable and responsible alternatives. By circulating carefully crafted narratives among Castilian nobles, they'll attempt to erode Juan's political standing while building their own legitimacy as potential regents or power brokers.\n\nThe political maneuvering will involve subtle yet calculated steps: convening an unauthorized assembly of nobles, presenting themselves as realm protectors, and pressuring cities and regional councils to support their perspective. They'll strategically seek to control access to resources, particularly the treasury, without triggering immediate open conflict.\n\nTheir military strategy focuses on strategic positioning rather than direct confrontation. They'll carefully deploy forces near critical locations, secure their own territories, and attempt to win support from Military Orders. The goal is creating a network of influence and pressure that can be activated quickly if Juan returns or makes a significant political move.\n\nThe actual revolt's timing will depend on specific triggers - Juan's imminent return, potential papal communications, or a strategic provocation that allows them to justify their actions as necessary for the realm's protection.\n\nTheir approach will likely avoid direct rebellion or violent tactics. Instead, they'll pursue delegitimizing Juan's rule by questioning his fitness to govern, demanding a powerful regency council, and seeking to remove Álvaro from influence. They'll aim to force negotiations from a position of strength by controlling key cities and fortresses.\n\nTheir initial success would involve rallying around 30-40% of major noble houses, seizing strategic urban centers, and creating a political crisis that cannot be easily dismissed. The ultimate goal is to dramatically weaken Juan's political standing and consolidate their own power.\n\nThe revolt would likely emerge in month 3 or early month 4, triggered by news of Juan's extended absence in Rome and growing frustration with the current regency council's ineffectiveness. Their strategic positioning would aim to challenge Juan before he can return with papal support, creating a critical window of political opportunity.\n\nThe Infantes' Revolt - Strategic Analysis\n\nBased on the established situation, let me analyze what the Infantes would likely do during Juan's absence. We know from the dice that they will revolt despite Juan's careful planning - so something goes wrong enough to embolden them to action.\n\nWhat the Infantes Know\n\nJuan caught them plotting to make the regency permanent\n\nJuan removed Infante Juan from council, threatened his life\n\nJuan left on \"pilgrimage\" to Santiago, then continued through France\n\nThey control the narrative about Juan's \"divine guidance\" claims\n\nThe regency council has only 3 members requiring unanimous consent\n\nÁlvaro de Luna still holds day-to-day administration\n\nWhat They Don't Know (Yet)\n\nJuan went to Rome specifically\n\nJuan obtained a papal crusade bull\n\nJuan's intelligence network (the cabinet)\n\nThe full extent of papal backing Juan secured\n\nTheir Likely Objectives\n\nPrimary Goal: Restore their position and honor - the public humiliation cannot stand\n\nSecondary Goal: Remove or neutralize Álvaro de Luna - the real obstacle to their power\n\nTertiary Goal: Either control Juan through a formal regency structure OR replace him entirely if necessary\n\nProposed Timeline of Their Actions\n\nPhase 1: Weeks 1-6 (May-June 1430) - Building Legitimacy\n\nLetters to King Alfonso V:\n\nFrame Juan as dangerously unstable and impulsive\n\nEmphasize the death threat against a royal prince of Aragon\n\nPaint Juan as manipulated by low-born Álvaro\n\nRequest Alfonso's support or at minimum his understanding\n\nPropaganda Among Castilian Nobility:\n\nCirculate letters describing Juan's \"mystical obsessions\"\n\nEmphasize he abandoned the realm for religious wandering\n\nPortray him as unfit for sole rule due to youth and instability\n\nPromise reduction of Álvaro's power to nobles who support them\n\nResult: Build coalition of \"concerned\" nobles who fear an erratic king and resent Álvaro's influence\n\nPhase 2: Weeks 6-10 (July 1430) - Political Maneuvering\n\nUnauthorized Assembly:\n\nCall a gathering of nobles at one of their estates\n\nFrame it as \"consultation for realm's protection\" during king's absence\n\nNOT openly treasonous - claiming to act in Juan's interests\n\nDraft proposals for \"necessary reforms\" (limiting royal power, removing Álvaro)\n\nPressure on Regency Council:\n\nWork on Archbishop and Marquis de Santillana\n\nArgue regency needs broader powers given Juan's extended absence\n\nTry to get them to authorize actions \"for realm's stability\"\n\nUrban Centers:\n\nSend agents to major cities\n\nOffer trade benefits, tax relief if they support \"reforms\"\n\nParticularly target merchant communities who dislike uncertainty\n\nMilitary Orders:\n\nApproach Masters of Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara\n\nAppeal to them as \"natural leaders\" versus low-born favorites\n\nPromise restored prestige if they support noble coalition\n\nPhase 3: Weeks 10-14 (August 1430) - Military Positioning\n\nStrategic Deployments:\n\nMove their household troops to strategic locations\n\nNOT open warfare, but \"securing estates\" and \"maintaining order\"\n\nPosition forces near key roads and cities\n\nBuild fortifications on their properties\n\nSeizing Opportunities:\n\nIf any royal officials resist, claim they're Álvaro's corrupt appointees\n\nTake control of some royal revenues in areas they control\n\nPossibly seize a fortress or two under pretext of \"protection\"\n\nIntelligence Gathering:\n\nSpies watching for Juan's return\n\nAgents in ports watching for news\n\nTrying to intercept correspondence\n\nPhase 4: Weeks 14-16 (Late August/Early September) - The Breaking Point\n\nTriggering Event (one of these):\n\nNews reaches Castile that Juan was in Rome (not just Santiago)\n\nRumors of papal bull begin circulating\n\nJuan's return becomes imminent\n\nA specific provocation or miscalculation forces their hand\n\nThey simply judge they have enough support to act\n\nThe Actual Revolt Takes Form:\n\nPublic declaration that Juan is unfit for sole rule\n\nDemand for expanded regency with real power\n\nUltimatum: Remove Álvaro or face \"necessary measures\"\n\nSeize several key fortresses/cities \"for protection\"\n\nPossibly try to intercept Juan on his return journey\n\nWhat They Accomplish\n\nGiven the dice decreed revolt happens, they must achieve enough to create genuine crisis, but not enough to win outright (since Juan survives and continues).\n\nDefinite Accomplishments:\n\nRally 8-12 major noble houses to their cause (30-40% of great nobility)\n\nSecure control of 3-5 significant fortresses or cities\n\nGain explicit or tacit support from King Alfonso V of Aragon\n\nCreate widespread uncertainty about royal authority\n\nForce some of Juan's appointees into hiding or flight\n\nDisrupt royal administration in regions they control\n\nPosition military forces (5,000-8,000 men) threatening key locations\n\nPossible Accomplishments:\n\nWin support of one Military Order (probably Santiago via Master Luis de Guzmán)\n\nControl portions of royal revenue collection\n\nEstablish rival administrative center (perhaps at one of their estates)\n\nForce the regency council into paralysis\n\nIntercept and read some royal correspondence\n\nSpread effective propaganda about Juan's \"instability\"\n\nThings They DON'T Accomplish:\n\nCapture or kill Álvaro de Luna (he's too clever and escapes)\n\nTake Valladolid or Seville (too well-defended, too loyal)\n\nWin Church hierarchy's support (they wait to see papal position)\n\nAchieve unanimous noble support (many remain neutral or pro-Juan)\n\nPrevent Juan's return to Castile\n\nLearn about the crusade bull before Juan reveals it\n\nThe Situation When Juan Returns (September 1430)\n\nThe Infantes Control:\n\nNorthern corridor (through Burgos region)\n\nSeveral key fortresses\n\n~8,000 armed men positioned strategically\n\nSupport of ~35% of major nobility\n\nBacking from Aragon\n\nJuan's Loyal Forces Control:\n\nSeville and southern regions\n\nValladolid and core royal territories\n\nMost major cities remain neutral or loyalist\n\n~40% of major nobility loyal or leaning loyal\n\nChurch hierarchy waiting for papal clarification\n\nNeutral/Uncertain:\n\n~25% of nobility watching to see who prevails\n\nSeveral major cities (Toledo, Salamanca, Zamora)\n\nTwo of three Military Orders\n\nMany bishops and abbots\n\nCritical Question: Does Juan return to Seville (safer, loyalist) or attempt to reach Valladolid (riskier, more central)?\n\nQuestions for You\n\nDoes this timeline and escalation feel realistic given what we've established?\n\nShould the revolt be more or less successful? I aimed for \"genuine crisis but not overwhelming victory.\"\n\nWhat specific cities/fortresses should the Infantes control when Juan returns?\n\nShould there be a specific dramatic event that triggers the open revolt, or gradual escalation?\n\nHow does Álvaro de Luna specifically respond during these months? Does he hold Valladolid, or retreat to more defensible position?\n\nDo any of Juan's cabinet members get compromised, captured, or forced to flee?\n\nOnce we settle on these details, I can write the narrative of these events as they unfold, perhaps from multiple perspectives (Álvaro receiving reports, the Infantes' councils, Juan's advisors reacting, etc.)."

          "text": "**What the Infantes are attempting:**\n- Primary goal: Gain more power for themselves and their dynasty\n- Specific actions: Rally nobles, position forces, seize strategic locations, undermine Juan's authority, possibly capture/neutralize Álvaro\n\n**Their Resources:**\n- Two princes of Aragon (royal blood, legitimacy)\n- Infante Juan is King of Navarre (resources, troops, territory)\n- Established estates and followers in Castile\n- Years of political relationships and networks\n- Support from some nobles who dislike Álvaro\n- Likely backing from King Alfonso V of Aragon\n- Master of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán) is their ally\n- Wealth and ability to pay troops\n- ~4 months to work while Juan is gone\n\n**Factors Working Against Them:**\n- Juan is the anointed king with legitimate authority\n- They were publicly humiliated (Infante Juan removed from council)\n- Álvaro de Luna is politically brilliant and has been preparing\n- Juan has his secret cabinet gathering intelligence\n- Major cities tend to support legitimate authority\n- Church hierarchy likely to wait for papal clarification\n- Only rumors of papal bull (not confirmation) - this might make them MORE desperate\n- They're acting while king is absent - looks like rebellion/usurpation\n- Not all nobles support them - many are neutral or loyalist\n- Military Orders are divided (only Santiago clearly with them)\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Medieval nobles revolting against their king had mixed success\n- Rebellions during royal absence were common but not always successful\n- Having royal blood (they're princes of Aragon) gives them legitimacy claims\n- But Juan II is the legitimate king, not a usurper or child\n\n- Álvaro has held power for years and knows how to maneuver\n- The pope backing Juan (even if they only have rumors) is devastating to their legitimacy\n\nTheir strategic goal is complex: they want to force a power-sharing arrangement that dramatically increases their political influence. Success means creating enough pressure to compel Juan to negotiate, not necessarily completely overthrowing him. They're playing a high-stakes political chess game, hoping to leverage their royal connections and noble support to reshape the kingdom's power structure.\n\nThe rebellion's prospects look precarious. Despite having significant resources like royal blood and the Master of Santiago's support, they face critical challenges. Juan's legitimate claim and potential papal backing create substantial obstacles. Their preparation and Álvaro's unpopularity among nobles provide some advantage, but the risks of open rebellion are immense. The political calculus suggests this is more a dangerous gamble than a probable victory.\n\nTheir core vulnerabilities include challenging a king with divine right, facing potential church opposition, and risking major cities' allegiance. Many nobles will likely remain neutral, unwilling to commit to such a risky venture. The unconfirmed papal rumors further complicate their strategic position, potentially undermining their legitimacy before the rebellion even fully begins.\n\nWhile they might achieve limited tactical successes like seizing fortresses or rallying some supporters, their broader strategic goals seem improbable. The fundamental weakness of rebelling against an anointed monarch with potential institutional support makes their ultimate triumph unlikely.\n\nProbability Assessment: The Infantes' Revolt\n\nYou're absolutely right - I was predetermining outcomes. Let me properly assess their chances.\n\nWhat They're Attempting\n\nPrimary Goal: Gain substantial power for themselves and their dynasty - either force Juan into genuine power-sharing arrangement or establish themselves as power brokers he cannot ignore\n\nSpecific Objectives:\n\nRally significant noble support (40%+ of great houses)\n\nSeize strategic fortresses and cities\n\nCapture or neutralize Álvaro de Luna\n\nControl portions of royal administration and revenues\n\nEstablish themselves as legitimate alternative power center\n\nForce Juan to negotiate from weakness upon his return\n\nTheir Resources & Advantages\n\nStrong Points:\n\nRoyal blood (princes of Aragon, legitimate dynasty)\n\nInfante Juan is King of Navarre (troops, resources, territory)\n\nEstablished estates and networks in Castile\n\n~4 months of preparation time while Juan absent\n\nSome guaranteed noble supporters (those who hate Álvaro)\n\nMaster of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán) likely with them\n\nSignificant wealth to hire troops and buy support\n\nPolitical experience and sophistication\n\nKing Alfonso V of Aragon probably backing them\n\nJuan's humiliation of Infante Juan creates sympathy among nobles\n\nFactors Working Against Them\n\nWeak Points:\n\nJuan II is the anointed, legitimate king - divine right matters\n\nThey are openly rebelling - this undermines their own legitimacy claims\n\nRumors of papal bull (even unconfirmed) are devastating to their position\n\nÁlvaro de Luna is politically brilliant and has been preparing defenses\n\nJuan has secret intelligence cabinet they don't know about\n\nMajor cities tend to support legitimate royal authority\n\nChurch hierarchy will wait for papal clarification before choosing sides\n\nMany nobles will stay neutral rather than join open rebellion\n\nThey're acting while king is absent - looks like usurpation/opportunism\n\nTwo of three Military Orders remain uncommitted\n\nThey were publicly humiliated at council - looks like revenge rather than principle\n\nHistorical Context\n\nMedieval precedents suggest:\n\nNoble rebellions during royal absence were common but risky\n\nLegitimacy matters enormously in this era\n\nPapal backing can make or break such conflicts\n\nFractious nobility often stays neutral until clear winner emerges\n\nRebels need overwhelming support to force king's hand\n\nWithout capturing the king or capital, rebels often fail to consolidate\n\nMy Assessment\n\nLIKELY TO FAIL\n\nReasoning:\n\nThey have real resources and some advantages - royal blood, time, wealth, experienced leadership, guaranteed supporters, and righteous grievance (the death threat). In different circumstances, this might be \"likely to succeed.\"\n\nHowever, they face fundamental problems:\n\nLegitimacy crisis: They're rebelling against their anointed king. Medieval political culture makes this extremely difficult to justify, especially when Juan hasn't obviously failed as ruler.\n\nPapal rumors: Even unconfirmed reports of papal backing for Juan are catastrophic. No noble wants to rebel against a king blessed by the Pope. This alone might be decisive.\n\nÁlvaro's competence: He's held power for years against noble opposition. He's politically brilliant, has his own networks, and has had time to prepare since Juan left.\n\nNeutral nobles: Most Castilian nobility will watch rather than commit to open rebellion. They'll wait to see who's winning before choosing sides.\n\nUrban centers: Cities like Seville, Toledo, Valladolid tend to support legitimate authority unless given compelling reason otherwise.\n\nChurch position: Without Church support (which they won't get if papal rumors are true), medieval rebellions struggle for legitimacy.\n\nLikely Outcome: They accomplish something - seize a few fortresses, rally some supporters, create genuine crisis - but fall short of their main goals. They don't capture Álvaro, don't control major cities, don't force Juan into power-sharing. They create chaos but don't achieve decisive advantage.\n\nYour Turn to Roll\n\nPlease roll for their revolt attempt:\n\nGreat Success: They accomplish most objectives - capture key locations, rally 40%+ nobles, maybe even capture Álvaro or seize major city\n\nSuccess: They accomplish some objectives - seize several fortresses, rally 25-35% noble support, create significant power base\n\nFailure: They accomplish little - few fortresses, limited noble support (~15-20%), easily contained by loyalists\n\nCatastrophic Failure: The revolt backfires - few supporters, quick suppression, maybe key leaders captured or killed\n\nWhat do you roll?"

          "text": "Okay, so the Infantes' revolt has FAILED. Given the \"Likely to Fail\" assessment, and getting a \"Failure\" result, they accomplish very little. Let me think about what this means:\n\nFailure means:\n- They accomplish little\n- Few fortresses seized\n- Limited noble support (15-20%)\n- Easily contained by loyalists\n- Minor negative consequences for them\n\nSo what actually happens? Let me think chronologically through their attempted revolt:\n\nPhase 1 (May-June): Building legitimacy through letters and propaganda\n- This probably goes okay initially - they can write letters and spread rumors\n\nPhase 2 (July): Political maneuvering\n- The unauthorized noble assembly - this is where things start going wrong\n- Fewer nobles show up than expected\n- The regency council doesn't break in their favor\n- Urban centers don't commit\n\nPhase 3 (August): Military positioning\n- They try to seize fortresses and position troops\n- But without broad support, this is harder than expected\n- Álvaro's defenses hold\n- They manage to take a few minor positions but not strategic ones\n\nPhase 4 (Late August): The breaking point - rumors of papal bull\n- This is DEVASTATING to their cause\n- Nobles who were wavering decide to wait\n- Any momentum collapses\n- They're left exposed\n\nThe result: They've openly moved against the king, but with minimal accomplishments. This is actually worse for them than not acting at all, because now they're committed rebels with little to show for it.\n\nLet me write this as a narrative describing what happened during Juan's absence, from multiple perspectives.\n\nChapter 4: The Failed Revolt\n\nKingdom of Castile, May - August 1430\n\nThe First Moves (May - June 1430)\n\nAt the Infantes' Council - Medina del Campo, May 20\n\n\"He threatened to take my head.\" Infante Juan's voice was cold as he addressed the assembled lords in his private chambers. Fifteen nobles had answered his summons - less than he'd hoped, but enough to begin.\n\n\"A boy of eighteen, advised by a low-born upstart, threatens a prince of Aragon. What does this tell you about the state of Castile?\"\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán, Master of the Order of Santiago, nodded grimly. \"It tells me the realm needs steadier hands.\"\n\nBut others were more cautious. The Count of Benavente spoke carefully: \"The king is young and impulsive, yes. But he is the anointed king. We must be careful how we proceed.\"\n\nInfante Enrique, standing by the window, turned to face them. \"My brother and I seek no throne. We seek only to restore proper governance - a council with real authority, not this mockery where one man can be removed at a boy's whim.\"\n\nOver the next weeks, letters flowed from the Infantes' network to nobles across Castile. The message was consistent: Juan II was unstable, driven by \"divine visions,\" and dominated by Álvaro de Luna. For the realm's safety, experienced hands must guide him.\n\nÁlvaro's Response - Valladolid, May 25\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna read the intercepted letter with a slight smile. Juan de Daza, the treasury official turned intelligence gatherer, stood before him.\n\n\"Seven copies of essentially the same letter, my lord. Sent to major houses across the kingdom. The Infantes are building their coalition.\"\n\n\"How many have responded positively?\"\n\n\"Four have sent cautiously supportive replies. Three have ignored it entirely. Two have forwarded copies to us.\"\n\nÁlvaro nodded. \"The realm is watching and waiting. Good. Send word to our supporters - the cities especially. Assure them the king returns soon with the Church's blessing. Say nothing more specific yet.\"\n\n\"And if the Infantes move more aggressively?\"\n\n\"Then they reveal themselves as rebels while their king is on pilgrimage. Even their allies will hesitate at that.\"\n\nThe Unauthorized Assembly - Burgos, June 28\n\nInfante Juan had called for a gathering of \"concerned lords\" at Burgos. He'd expected thirty, perhaps forty nobles to attend.\n\nTwenty-three came.\n\nSome were reliable allies - Luis de Guzmán, several lords with grievances against Álvaro, a few northern families loyal to Navarre. But many invited nobles sent polite refusals or said nothing at all.\n\nStanding before the modest assembly, Infante Juan made his case: \"We propose no treason. We seek legitimate reform. A proper council with binding authority over major decisions. The removal of Don Álvaro from his monopoly of power. The restoration of natural order - nobility advising and constraining monarchy, as is proper.\"\n\nThe assembled lords listened. Some nodded. But when he asked for formal commitments, the responses were hedged:\n\n\"We support the principle of proper counsel...\"\n\"When the king returns, we should certainly discuss reforms...\"\n\"If His Majesty agrees, we would naturally support such changes...\"\n\nNo one would commit to action. Not yet. Not without knowing which way the wind would blow.\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán was more direct: \"My lord, we need more than words. We need to show strength. Secure key positions. Then others will follow.\"\n\nThe Military Phase (July - August 1430)\n\nAttempted Seizures - Various Locations, July-August\n\nThe Infantes tried to translate political maneuvering into military reality. Their household troops - perhaps 3,000 men between them - moved to \"secure\" strategic locations.\n\nAt Tordesillas (July 15): Infante Juan's men approached the fortress with demands to \"garrison\" it for protection. The castellan, appointed by Álvaro three years ago, closed the gates.\n\n\"On whose authority?\" he called from the walls.\n\n\"On the authority of the King's regency council!\"\n\n\"The regency council has no authority to garrison royal fortresses. I hold this castle for King Juan II. Come back with his written order.\"\n\nThe Infantes' force wasn't large enough to besiege it. They withdrew.\n\nAt Arévalo (July 22): A smaller fortress, elderly castellan, undermanned garrison. This one they took - the castellan yielded rather than face assault. It was their first success.\n\nAt Olmedo (July 28): The town council refused entry to Infante Enrique's troops. \"We are loyal to our anointed king. When he returns and orders us to open our gates to you, we shall comply.\"\n\nAt Segovia (August 3): The city's merchants, having received assurances from Álvaro about their trade privileges, barred their gates. When the Infantes' representative demanded entry, the city council sent a blunt reply: \"Segovia serves the king. Not princes of Aragon.\"\n\nÁlvaro's Counter-Moves\n\nWhile the Infantes maneuvered, Álvaro moved decisively:\n\nTo the Major Cities: Letters went to Seville, Toledo, Valladolid, Salamanca, and Zamora. \"The king returns soon with great news. Those who remain loyal will be remembered. Those who waver will find their privileges... reconsidered.\"\n\nTo the Military Orders: Private communications with the Masters of Calatrava and Alcántara. \"The Master of Santiago has chosen his side. You need not follow him into error. The Church will make its position clear soon.\"\n\nTo the Church Hierarchy: Careful hints that Juan's pilgrimage had taken him beyond Santiago. That Rome itself might be involved. That the Pope's position should be known before anyone makes irrevocable choices.\n\nPersonal Security: Álvaro strengthened Valladolid's garrison, secured the treasury, and moved the royal archives to safer locations. The Infantes would find no easy targets here.\n\nThe Military Balance - Mid-August\n\nWhat the Infantes Controlled:\n\nArévalo fortress (minor position)\n\nTwo smaller castles in the north\n\nTheir own household troops (~3,000 men)\n\nGarrison of Pamplona (as King of Navarre)\n\nSome sympathetic nobles' private forces (~2,000 more)\n\nWhat They Did NOT Control:\n\nAny major city\n\nKey strategic fortresses (Tordesillas, Segovia, Toledo)\n\nThe royal treasury at Valladolid\n\nRoyal guards and household troops\n\nMost of the southern kingdom\n\nThe Military Orders:\n\nSantiago: Master Luis de Guzmán supported Infantes\n\nCalatrava: Master remained neutral, waiting\n\nAlcántara: Master remained neutral, leaning toward king\n\nNoble Support:\n\n~8 major houses openly with the Infantes (about 15% of great nobility)\n\n~12 major houses clearly loyal to Juan II (about 25%)\n\n~30+ houses neutral, watching, waiting (60%)\n\nThe neutrals were the key. And they showed no signs of moving.\n\nThe Breaking Point - The Rumor (August 18-20)\n\nHow the News Arrived\n\nA merchant galley from Genoa docked at Barcelona on August 15. Among the passengers were Italian traders who'd been in Rome. They carried extraordinary gossip.\n\nBy August 17, the story reached Zaragoza in Aragon. By August 18, it was in Navarre. By August 19, letters were flying across Castile.\n\nThe Rumor: The young King of Castile had appeared in Rome. He had met with Pope Martin V personally. Some versions claimed he'd been blessed. Others said he'd received papal backing for something significant. A few wild versions mentioned him stripping naked before the Pope in an act of profound devotion.\n\nNo one had details. No one had seen the official documents. But the story was too specific, too strange to be entirely fabricated.\n\nThe Infantes' Crisis Council - Pamplona, August 20\n\n\"Is it true?\" Infante Enrique demanded.\n\nHis brother Infante Juan sat heavily in his chair. \"Our sources in Rome have sent nothing. But three separate merchant reports tell the same basic story. Juan was there. He met the Pope privately. Something significant happened.\"\n\n\"If the Pope blessed him...\"\n\n\"Then every noble still wavering will stay neutral. The Church will back him. Our support collapses.\" Infante Juan's voice was bitter. \"We've moved too slowly. We should have acted in June when he first left.\"\n\nDon Luis de Guzmán, Master of Santiago, spoke grimly: \"We've committed ourselves. We hold Arévalo. We've called assemblies. We've written letters accusing the king of instability. We cannot simply withdraw now.\"\n\n\"Then what do we do?\" Infante Enrique asked.\n\nSilence.\n\nFinally, Infante Juan spoke: \"We wait for Juan to return. We maintain what positions we hold. We send to our brother Alfonso in Naples - he must know what Rome decides. And we prepare for negotiation, not triumph.\"\n\n\"Negotiation from weakness,\" Enrique observed.\n\n\"Better than rebellion from isolation.\"\n\nÁlvaro's Intelligence Report - Valladolid, August 21\n\nDiego Gómez de Sandoval, Count of Castro, reported to Álvaro with barely contained satisfaction:\n\n\"My lord, the Infantes' coalition is collapsing. Three nobles who attended their Burgos assembly have sent letters distancing themselves. The Count of Benavente explicitly says he 'attended only to hear concerns, not to join rebellion.'\"\n\n\"And their military positions?\"\n\n\"They hold Arévalo and two minor castles. Nothing else. Their troops haven't moved in a week. They're waiting.\"\n\nÁlvaro smiled. \"Waiting for what? For us to act? For the king to return? For Rome to declare against them?\"\n\n\"All three, I think.\"\n\n\"Then let them wait. When His Majesty returns with the Pope's blessing, they'll find themselves very isolated indeed.\"\n\nThe Church's Position - Various Locations, August 21-25\n\nAt Toledo: Archbishop Juan Martínez de Contreras received a private letter from Cardinal Giordano Orsini. After reading it, he called his closest advisors.\n\n\"The young king knelt naked before Pope Martin V. He offered everything - crown, wealth, his very person - in service to God and Church. His Holiness was moved to tears. A crusade bull has been granted.\"\n\nThe advisors stared.\n\n\"We will say nothing publicly until the king returns with the official document. But privately, let it be known: the Church stands with Juan II. Any who oppose him oppose the Pope's chosen instrument.\"\n\nAt Santiago de Compostela: Archbishop Lope de Mendoza received similar communication. He immediately sent letters to every major monastery and bishopric in his network: \"Wait for the king's return. Do not commit to the Infantes. Rome has spoken, though we must wait for public announcement.\"\n\nThroughout Castile: Bishops who had been carefully neutral suddenly became subtly pro-Juan. Not openly, not officially, but in quiet conversations, in who they met with, in what they emphasized in sermons.\n\nThe Infantes felt the shift even if they couldn't see its source.\n\nThe Collapse (Late August)\n\nThe Silent Withdrawal\n\nNo dramatic battles. No great siegures. Just... silence.\n\nThe nobles who'd been \"considering\" the Infantes' proposals sent no more letters.\n\nThe cities that had been \"evaluating\" their position quietly reinforced their garrisons and flew royal banners more prominently.\n\nThe Military Orders of Calatrava and Alcántara sent polite but firm letters to the Infantes: \"We serve the king and await his return.\"\n\nEven Master Luis de Guzmán of Santiago, their firmest supporter, advised caution: \"Wait for the November council in Seville. Make your case there, formally, before all the realm. This... this hasn't worked.\"\n\nFinal Positions - Early September\n\nBy the time Juan II prepared to sail from Barcelona to Seville, the situation had stabilized:\n\nThe Infantes Held:\n\nArévalo fortress\n\nTwo minor northern castles\n\nTheir household troops (still ~3,000 men)\n\nExplicit support of perhaps 6-8 noble houses (10-15% of great nobility)\n\nMaster of Santiago (wavering but still nominally with them)\n\nThe Crown Held:\n\nAll major cities (Seville, Valladolid, Toledo, Burgos, Salamanca, Segovia, Zamora)\n\nAll significant fortresses except Arévalo\n\nThe treasury\n\nRoyal administration intact\n\nSupport of ~15-20 major houses (25-30% of great nobility)\n\nChurch hierarchy (privately, awaiting public confirmation)\n\nThe Military Orders of Calatrava and Alcántara\n\nNeutral Position:\n\n~30-35 noble houses still watching (55-60% of great nobility)\n\nMany smaller towns and fortresses\n\nSignificant merchant communities\n\nCritical Reality: The Infantes had attempted revolt and accomplished almost nothing. They were now committed rebels with minimal gains, facing a king who would return with papal backing.\n\nThey had failed. And everyone knew it.\n\nÁlvaro's Assessment - September 1\n\nDon Álvaro de Luna sat in his office in Valladolid, reading the latest reports. Rodrigo Manrique, the frontier commander turned intelligence gatherer, stood before him.\n\n\"They're finished, aren't they?\" Rodrigo asked.\n\n\"Not finished. Wounded. Exposed. Committed to opposition but without the strength to sustain it.\" Álvaro set down the papers. \"They gambled that the kingdom would rally to them during the king's absence. Instead, the kingdom stayed loyal or neutral.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because Juan is the anointed king.\" Álvaro's voice was matter-of-fact. \"Because rumors of papal blessing reached before they could consolidate. Because they're Aragonese princes trying to control Castile - and that matters more than most admit. And because...\"\n\nHe smiled slightly. \"Because we prepared for this. The cabinet worked. The cities held. The intelligence network functioned. When they moved, we were ready.\"\n\n\"So what happens when the king returns?\"\n\n\"That depends on what he brings with him. If it's truly a papal crusade bull, the Infantes will have to submit or face excommunication. They'll try to salvage what they can at the November council.\"\n\n\"And if they don't submit?\"\n\nÁlvaro's smile faded. \"Then we'll have a civil war. A small one, probably brief, but ugly nonetheless. Let's hope it doesn't come to that.\"\n\nThe Infantes' Perspective - Pamplona, September 3\n\nInfante Juan stood on the walls of his capital, looking south toward Castile. His brother Enrique joined him.\n\n\"We should have waited,\" Juan said quietly. \"Should have waited for him to return, to reveal whatever Rome gave him. Then opposed it formally, legally, through proper channels.\"\n\n\"He humiliated you. Threatened your life.\"\n\n\"And I let pride push me into premature action.\" Juan's voice was bitter. \"Now we're rebels with nothing to show for it. Three castles. A handful of supporters. And a king returning with the Pope's blessing.\"\n\n\"Alfonso will support us. Our brother won't abandon us.\"\n\n\"Alfonso is in Naples trying to conquer a kingdom. He has enough problems without adding Castilian civil war to his list.\" Juan turned to face Enrique. \"We're alone in this.\"\n\n\"So what do we do?\"\n\nJuan was quiet for a long moment. \"We go to Seville in November. We acknowledge the crusade bull - we'll have no choice, not if it's real. We try to negotiate a position where we're not utterly destroyed. And we remember: we're princes of Aragon and kings of Navarre. Castile is not our only realm.\"\n\n\"That's surrender.\"\n\n\"No. It's survival. There's a difference.\" Juan looked south again. \"The boy outmaneuvered us. He went to Rome while we wrote letters. He secured the Pope while we seized empty castles. He built a coalition while we scattered ours.\"\n\n\"He had Álvaro.\"\n\n\"And we had each other, and experience, and wealth, and noble blood, and it wasn't enough.\" Juan's voice hardened. \"Next time - if there is a next time - we'll be smarter. We'll be patient. We'll wait for him to fail on his own.\"\n\n\"You think he will?\"\n\n\"He's eighteen years old, planning to conquer Granada, advised by a favorite the nobles hate, backed by a Pope who won't live forever. Of course he'll fail eventually. The question is whether we survive long enough to see it.\"\n\nStatus Report - September 1430\n\nThe Infantes' Revolt: FAILED\n\nAccomplishments:\n\nSeized Arévalo fortress and two minor castles\n\nRallied explicit support from 6-8 major noble houses (~12% of great nobility)\n\nCreated temporary instability and concern\n\nMaintained Master of Santiago's (wavering) support\n\nFailures:\n\nDid not seize any major city\n\nDid not capture or neutralize Álvaro de Luna\n\nDid not win over significant neutral nobles\n\nDid not secure Military Orders' support (2 of 3 remained neutral)\n\nDid not control royal revenues or administration\n\nDid not prevent or delay papal backing for Juan\n\nDid not build sustainable coalition\n\nCurrent Situation:\n\nThe Infantes are exposed as rebels but without strength to sustain rebellion\n\nMost of Castile remained loyal or neutral during king's absence\n\nRumors of papal crusade bull devastated their legitimacy\n\nThey must now negotiate from profound weakness at November council\n\nCivil war remains possible but unlikely (they lack support for it)\n\nÁlvaro's Position:\n\nHeld Valladolid and royal administration intact\n\nAll major cities remained under crown control\n\nIntelligence network (Juan's cabinet) functioned effectively\n\nSuccessfully countered Infantes' propaganda\n\nProtected royal revenues and strategic positions\n\nThe Kingdom:\n\nStable despite attempted revolt\n\nWaiting for king's return and revelation of papal backing\n\nChurch hierarchy subtly shifted to support Juan\n\nMost nobility stayed neutral, watching\n\nUrban centers proved loyal to legitimate authority\n\nConsequences for Chapter 4:\n\nWhen Juan returns to Castile (likely landing in Barcelona, then proceeding to Seville), he will find:\n\nAn attempted revolt that collapsed - validating his decision to go to Rome\n\nÁlvaro proven capable - held the kingdom during king's absence\n\nThe Infantes weakened but not destroyed - dangerous wounded animals\n\nMost of the kingdom neutral - waiting to see what he brings from Rome\n\nPerfect setup for dramatic revelation - when he presents the crusade bull at Seville council, he does so from position of strength\n\nThe failure of the Infantes' revolt means Juan's gamble paid off. But it also means they're now desperate, which brings its own dangers.\n\nEnd of Infantes' Revolt Summary\n\nNext: What actions, if any, has the Kingdom of Granada taken during this period? They've surely been watching Castilian instability with great interest."

          "text": "This is excellent - we need to assess what Muhammad IX (Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Nasr), Sultan of Granada, would do in response to these developments.\n\nLet me think about what he knows and what resources he has:\n\n**What the Sultan Knows by September 1430:**\n1. Young King Juan II (18 years old) has recently begun personal rule in Castile\n2. Castile is fractious with internal conflicts (the Infantes' revolt)\n3. The king went on pilgrimage and was gone for months\n4. Rumors (possibly confirmed by spies) of a papal crusade bull\n5. The Infantes attempted revolt and failed\n6. The king is returning with papal backing\n\n**Historical Context of Granada in 1430:**\n- Muhammad IX was actually Sultan 1419-1427 and 1429-1445 (had been deposed briefly)\n- Granada was wealthy, well-defended, with excellent fortifications\n- The kingdom had survived for nearly 200 years through combination of military strength, diplomacy, tribute payments, and exploiting Castilian divisions\n- Granada had professional military, strong economy based on trade and agriculture\n- The kingdom was not unified internally - always court factions and potential succession disputes\n- Granada regularly played Christian kingdoms against each other\n\n**The Sultan's Strategic Options:**\n\n1. **Military Preparation**: Strengthen fortifications, raise troops, stockpile supplies\n2. **Diplomatic Outreach**: Try to negotiate with Castile, appeal to other powers\n3. **Exploit Castilian Divisions**: Support the Infantes secretly, encourage civil war\n4. **Seek External Allies**: Reach out to Marinid Morocco, Ottomans (far away), or other Muslim powers\n5. **Preemptive Strike**: Attack Castilian frontier while kingdom is divided\n6. **Economic Warfare**: Disrupt Castilian trade, withhold tribute\n7. **Internal Consolidation**: Ensure his own position is secure, eliminate potential rivals\n\n**What Would Muhammad IX Likely Do?**\n\nAs a seasoned political survivor, he would carefully balance defensive preparations with strategic diplomatic maneuvering. His primary goal would be to maintain Granada's independence while minimizing direct military confrontation. I'll focus on a multi-layered approach that leverages his diplomatic skills and understanding of Castilian internal politics.\n\nThe strategy would prioritize defensive readiness, secret diplomatic negotiations, and exploiting the kingdom's internal divisions. Muhammad IX would meticulously gather intelligence, strengthen his fortifications, and create multiple potential paths to maintain Granada's autonomy without risking a full-scale war.\n\nSultan Muhammad IX's Response - Strategic Assessment\n\nWhat the Sultan Knows (August-September 1430)\n\nMuhammad IX (Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Nasr), Sultan of Granada, sits in the Alhambra reviewing intelligence reports from his extensive spy network:\n\nConfirmed Information:\n\nYoung King Juan II went on extended \"pilgrimage\" (4+ months absent)\n\nDuring his absence, the Infantes de Aragón attempted some kind of power grab\n\nThe revolt failed - major cities stayed loyal, few nobles joined\n\nStrong rumors of papal involvement - possibly a crusade bull\n\nKing Juan returns soon to Seville for major council (November 8)\n\nInternal Castilian politics remain fractured but king's position stronger than expected\n\nIntelligence from Christian Courts:\n\nSpecific reports from spies in Barcelona: King Juan was definitely in Rome\n\nMerchants from Genoa report extraordinary story of papal audience\n\nCardinal's letters intercepted: mentions \"crusade for Granada's conversion\"\n\nThe Pope granted something significant to Juan II\n\nAnalysis:\nThis is the most serious threat Granada has faced in decades. A papal crusade with unified Castilian command could be catastrophic. The kingdom has survived this long by exploiting Christian divisions - but a crusade removes that advantage.\n\nThe Sultan's Strategic Options\n\nOption 1: Military Preparation & Defense\n\nAction: Massively strengthen defenses, raise additional troops, stockpile supplies for sieges, improve fortifications\n\nResources Available:\n\nGranada's treasury: wealthy from trade, agriculture, and tribute arrangements\n\nProfessional standing army of ~8,000-10,000 men\n\nCan raise additional militia of 15,000-20,000\n\nExcellent fortifications (Alhambra, city walls, frontier castles)\n\nSkilled engineers and siege specialists\n\nStrong defensive terrain (mountains, narrow passes)\n\nProbability Assessment: LIKELY TO SUCCEED\n\nGranada has wealth, existing strong defenses, and time to prepare. Military preparation is something they can control directly. The kingdom has excellent defensive positions and experienced military leadership.\n\nOption 2: Exploit Castilian Divisions - Support the Infantes\n\nAction: Secret diplomatic contact with the Infantes, offer gold and promises of alliance, encourage them to continue resistance\n\nWhat Granada Could Offer:\n\nGold (substantial amounts from treasury)\n\nPromise of military support if civil war erupts\n\nIntelligence about Juan's movements and plans\n\nSafe haven if needed\n\nContinuation of tribute arrangements (incentive to keep Granada independent)\n\nWhat the Infantes Might Accept:\nThey're desperate and weakened. Gold could help them raise troops. The promise of \"enemy of my enemy\" alliance might be tempting. But they're Christian nobles - openly allying with Muslims would destroy their legitimacy entirely.\n\nObstacles:\n\nThe Infantes are Christians - open alliance with Granada would be devastating to their reputation\n\nThe failed revolt means they're watched closely\n\nThey'd have to be extremely desperate to accept Muslim gold\n\nIf discovered, it would unite all Castile against them\n\nÁlvaro's intelligence network might detect this\n\nEven secret contact is extremely risky for both sides\n\nProbability Assessment: LIKELY TO FAIL\n\nThe Infantes need help but the political cost of accepting Muslim support is too high. They're beaten but not destroyed - they still have options that don't require crossing that line. This might work if they were completely desperate, but the revolt's failure wasn't catastrophic enough to force them into this.\n\nOption 3: Diplomatic Outreach to Castile\n\nAction: Send formal embassy to Juan II, offer increased tribute, trade agreements, peaceful coexistence, recognition of Castilian overlordship (in form if not substance)\n\nWhat Granada Could Offer:\n\nSubstantial increase in tribute (50,000-100,000 gold dinars annually)\n\nTrade privileges for Castilian merchants\n\nReturn of Christian captives\n\nAllow Christian missionaries (limited, controlled)\n\nRecognition of Castilian \"suzerainty\" (symbolic)\n\nHelp against other enemies (Muslims who raid Castilian coast?)\n\nWhy This Might Work:\n\nGranada has used this strategy successfully for 200 years\n\nTribute provides immediate revenue vs. expensive war\n\nPeace allows Juan to consolidate power internally first\n\nYoung king might be pragmatic enough to take the deal\n\nPope's crusade bull might allow for \"peaceful conversion\" option\n\nBuys time for Granada to prepare if war comes anyway\n\nObstacles:\n\nJuan II just got papal crusade bull - politically difficult to ignore\n\nAccepting tribute looks weak after getting Pope's blessing\n\nThe crusade creates religious momentum that's hard to stop\n\nJuan needs the crusade to unite his fractious nobility\n\nReligious fervor vs. pragmatic diplomacy - fervor might win\n\nFray Hernando might support giving diplomacy a chance, but...\n\nProbability Assessment: LIKELY TO FAIL\n\nUnder normal circumstances this would be Granada's best bet. But Juan has papal crusade bull, needs the war politically, and is religiously motivated (even if pragmatic). The timing is terrible for Granada - this diplomatic approach would have worked better before the crusade bull. Now it looks like desperate delay tactics.\n\nHowever - Juan DID promise Fray Hernando he'd try diplomacy first. So this attempt wouldn't be completely futile. It might buy time, might create diplomatic record, might sow some doubt. But it won't prevent the crusade.\n\nOption 4: Seek External Muslim Allies\n\nAction: Send embassies to Marinid Morocco, Hafsid Tunisia, Mamluk Egypt, even distant Ottomans - seek military or financial support\n\nPotential Allies:\n\nMarinid Morocco (closest, most relevant):\n\nDynasty in decline, facing internal instability\n\nHave supported Granada in past but currently weak\n\nCould provide some troops, financial support\n\nNaval support to raid Castilian coasts?\n\nHafsid Tunisia / Mamluk Egypt:\n\nWealthy, powerful, but very far away\n\nMore likely to send gold than troops\n\nPolitical/religious support, diplomatic pressure\n\nNot much practical military help\n\nOttoman Empire:\n\nRising power in Anatolia and Balkans\n\nSultan Murad II focused on conquering Constantinople and Balkans\n\nToo distant to provide meaningful support\n\nMight send token diplomatic support\n\nRealistic Outcomes:\n\nMorocco might provide 2,000-3,000 troops, some gold\n\nTunisia/Egypt might send financial support, religious declarations\n\nOttomans would probably send polite letters and nothing else\n\nMuslim world is fragmented, distant, and facing its own challenges\n\nAny support would be limited and take months to arrange\n\nProbability Assessment: LIKELY TO SUCCEED (at getting some support) / LIKELY TO FAIL (at getting game-changing help)\n\nGranada would definitely get something - the Muslim world wouldn't completely abandon them. But meaningful military support? Unlikely. The Islamic world in 1430 is too fragmented and distant to mount effective relief of Granada.\n\nWhat the Sultan Would Actually Attempt\n\nGiven limited time (we're in early September now) and intelligence about imminent threat, Muhammad IX would likely pursue multiple simultaneous strategies:\n\nPrimary Focus: Military Preparation\n\nThis is most critical and most controllable. He'd definitely do this.\n\nSecondary: Diplomatic Probe to Castile\n\nLow cost, might buy time, fulfills Islamic requirements to offer peace before war. Even if it fails, establishes moral position.\n\nTertiary: Reach Out to Morocco\n\nClose enough to potentially help, historical ally, worth trying even if results limited.\n\nUnlikely: Contact with Infantes\n\nToo risky, too likely to backfire, Infantes not desperate enough yet.\n\nActions for You to Roll\n\nI propose we roll for three separate actions the Sultan attempts:\n\nAction 1: Military Preparation & Defense Enhancement\n\nProbability: LIKELY TO SUCCEED\n\nGoal: Significantly strengthen Granada's military position before crusade begins\n\nRaise additional 10,000 militia troops (beyond 8,000 professional army)\n\nStockpile food and supplies for 6-12 month sieges in major cities\n\nRepair and improve fortifications on frontier castles\n\nPosition forces strategically across kingdom\n\nHire additional mercenaries from North Africa\n\nEstablish supply lines and logistics networks\n\nSuccess would mean: Granada enters the crusade significantly better prepared militarily, with larger forces, better supplies, improved defenses\n\nFailure would mean: Preparation is incomplete, expensive, or creates internal strain without proportionate benefit\n\nAction 2: Diplomatic Mission to Castile\n\nProbability: LIKELY TO FAIL\n\nGoal: Delay or prevent crusade through generous terms\n\nSend prestigious embassy to Juan II (after he returns to Seville)\n\nOffer substantial tribute increase (double current amount)\n\nPromise trade concessions, release of Christian captives\n\nPropose \"peaceful path to conversion\" - allow Christian missionaries, gradual conversion\n\nSeek negotiated settlement rather than war\n\nSuccess would mean: Juan seriously considers the offer, creates political debate in Castile, buys Granada significant time (months/years), might actually delay crusade\n\nFailure would mean: Juan politely refuses, uses offer as propaganda (\"they fear us\"), minimal delay to crusade plans\n\nAction 3: Request Military Support from Marinid Morocco\n\nProbability: LIKELY TO SUCCEED (at getting limited support)\n\nGoal: Secure external Muslim military assistance\n\nSend urgent embassy to Fez\n\nRequest troops, ships, gold, supplies\n\nAppeal to shared faith, historical alliance\n\nOffer commercial privileges, political alliance\n\nSuccess would mean: Morocco commits 3,000-5,000 troops, some naval support, financial aid - meaningful but not decisive help\n\nFailure would mean: Morocco sends only token support or promises, no substantial military help, Granada fights essentially alone\n\nYour Turn to Roll\n\nPlease roll for each of these three actions separately:\n\nMilitary Preparation (Likely to Succeed)\n\nDiplomatic Mission to Castile (Likely to Fail)\n\nMoroccan Alliance (Likely to Succeed for limited support)\n\nWhat do you roll for each?"

We should remember though that the sultan is making this offer and the player should encounter this. \nAction 3: Critical success, meaning the sultan probably gets lots of support from other muslim nations as well in one form or another.\n\n\nDraft the response and what happens based on these results, but don't exceed the current date of the game."

          "text": "Okay, so we have:\n1. Military Preparation: Failure (not catastrophic) - So Granada tries to prepare but something goes wrong or is incomplete\n2. Diplomatic Mission: Will be roleplayed with player - the sultan makes the offer\n3. Moroccan Alliance: Critical success - Much more support than expected from Muslim world\n\nLet me draft what happens with these results, staying within the current timeline (early September 1430, Juan is in Barcelona preparing to sail to Seville).\n\nFor Action 1 (Military Prep - Failure):\nThe Sultan tries to rapidly mobilize and strengthen defenses, but something goes wrong. Maybe:\n- Mobilizing militia too quickly causes economic disruption\n- Cost is higher than expected, strains treasury\n- Troops raised but not properly trained/equipped in time\n- Fortification work incomplete or rushed\n- Internal resistance to the mobilization\n- Some strategic mistake in deployment\n\nFor Action 3 (Moroccan Alliance - Critical Success):\nThis is interesting. Much better than expected. Maybe:\n- Morocco not only sends troops but commits substantially\n- Other Muslim powers also respond (Tunisia, Egypt send gold)\n- Naval support from North African corsairs\n- Religious fervor across Muslim world\n- Volunteers from across Maghreb\n- Even distant powers send support\n\nLet me write this out narratively.\n\nChapter 4: The Sultan's Gambit\n\nKingdom of Granada, August - September 1430\n\nThe Council of War - Alhambra Palace, August 22\n\nSultan Muhammad IX ibn Nasr stood before the assembled commanders and advisors in the Hall of the Ambassadors. The light streaming through the intricate arabesque windows cast geometric patterns across the marble floor. But the beauty of the Alhambra could not disguise the gravity of the situation.\n\n\"The intelligence is confirmed,\" the Sultan said, his voice steady but grim. \"The King of Castile has obtained a papal crusade bull. Not a minor blessing, but a full crusading authorization. He returns to Seville within weeks.\"\n\nYusuf ibn Ahmad, the Grand Vizier, spoke: \"My Sultan, we have survived crusades before. The Christians fight amongst themselves as much as they fight us.\"\n\n\"This time is different.\" The Sultan gestured to the maps spread across the table. \"This young king went to Rome himself. He united his fractious nobles long enough to make this journey. The Pope granted him supreme command over all Christian forces. And most concerning - the Infantes' revolt failed completely. Castile is more united than it has been in decades.\"\n\nAbu al-Hassan, commander of Granada's frontier forces, leaned forward. \"Then we must prepare for war. Immediately.\"\n\n\"We must do more than prepare,\" the Sultan replied. \"We must seek every advantage, every ally, every strategy to survive what is coming.\"\n\nAction 1: The Failed Mobilization (Late August - Early September)\n\nThe Emergency Decree - August 23\n\nSultan Muhammad IX issued orders across the kingdom:\n\nMilitary Mobilization:\n\nRaise 10,000 additional militia from farming communities\n\nConscript skilled craftsmen for siege preparations\n\nStockpile food for extended sieges in all major cities\n\nImprove fortifications on twenty frontier castles\n\nPosition strategic reserves across the kingdom\n\nFinancial Measures:\n\nEmergency taxation to fund mobilization\n\nRequisition of supplies from merchants\n\nHire mercenaries from across North Africa\n\nRecall all soldiers from leave\n\nThe orders went out with urgency bordering on panic.\n\nThe Economic Strain - Early September\n\nWithin two weeks, the problems became apparent.\n\nAt Granada's Markets:\n\nMerchant Abd al-Rahman protested to the tax collectors: \"You've already taken half my grain stores! How am I to trade with Castile now? How am I to feed my family?\"\n\n\"The Sultan requires provisions for the army.\"\n\n\"The Sultan requires a bankrupt kingdom? Because that's what he'll have if this continues!\"\n\nSimilar scenes played out across Granada. Merchants saw their goods requisitioned at below-market rates. Farmers lost workers to militia conscription during harvest season. Craftsmen abandoned profitable trades to work on fortifications.\n\nAt the Frontier Castles:\n\nThe commander at Íllora fortress reviewed the work crews: \"Where are the experienced masons I requested?\"\n\n\"Conscripted to work on Granada city walls, sir. Higher priority.\"\n\n\"And the supplies?\"\n\n\"Diverted to Málaga. Also higher priority.\"\n\nThe commander looked at the half-finished repairs to his walls and swore. Twenty castles meant resources spread impossibly thin. None would be properly reinforced in time.\n\nThe Militia Problem:\n\nCaptain Hamid ibn Yusuf watched the new militia recruits train - or attempt to train. Farm boys and craftsmen, pulled from their work, given spears they barely knew how to hold.\n\n\"They'll break at the first Christian charge,\" his sergeant observed.\n\n\"I know. But we needed numbers quickly.\" Hamid sighed. \"The Sultan ordered 10,000 militia. We raised 8,000, and half of them resent being here. This isn't how you build an army.\"\n\nThe Treasury Report - September 5\n\nGrand Vizier Yusuf ibn Ahmad presented the accounting to the Sultan:\n\n\"My lord, the mobilization has cost us 80,000 dinars so far. More than twice the initial estimate.\"\n\n\"And what have we achieved?\"\n\n\"Eight thousand militia raised - poorly trained, many reluctant. Fortification work on frontier castles is incomplete. Our professional army remains at full strength, but we've disrupted the entire economy to accomplish... partial preparation.\"\n\nThe Sultan closed his eyes briefly. \"We needed to do something.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord. But doing it too quickly, too broadly, created more problems than it solved. We've strained the treasury, angered merchants and farmers, and our military position is only marginally improved.\"\n\n\"Can we reverse course?\"\n\n\"Not without looking weak and indecisive. We're committed now.\"\n\nThe Result of Failure\n\nBy early September, Granada's emergency mobilization had produced:\n\nMilitary Gains:\n\n8,000 additional militia (poorly trained, many resentful)\n\nSome fortification improvements (incomplete, rushed work)\n\nProfessional 8,000-man army still intact and capable\n\nStrategic reserves positioned (but strained supply lines)\n\nTotal forces: ~16,000 men (vs. planned 18,000+)\n\nEconomic/Political Costs:\n\n80,000 dinars spent (28% of annual treasury surplus)\n\nMerchant community angry about requisitions\n\nFarmers resentful about conscription during harvest\n\nInternal discontent rising\n\nEconomic activity disrupted\n\nSupply shortages in some areas\n\nStrategic Assessment:\nGranada was somewhat better prepared militarily, but at significant economic and political cost. The rushed, panicked mobilization created internal strain without achieving the intended level of readiness. The kingdom was stronger than before, but not as strong as it needed to be, and it had paid a heavy price for partial success.\n\nAction 2: The Diplomatic Mission (Prepared September 6-10)\n\nThe Sultan's Instructions\n\n\"We will offer peace,\" Muhammad IX told his assembled advisors. \"Not because I believe it will succeed, but because we must try. Allah commands us to offer peace before war. And practically - if this young king hesitates even briefly, it buys us time.\"\n\nHe turned to Abu Abdullah al-Zaghal, his most skilled diplomat: \"You will lead the embassy. Wait until the Castilian king returns to Seville. Then present yourself formally with these terms.\"\n\nThe Offer Prepared\n\nThe diplomatic document was crafted with care:\n\nTo His Majesty Juan II, King of Castile and León:\n\nThe Proposal:\n\nTribute: Double the current annual payment - 100,000 gold dinars per year (up from 50,000)\n\nTrade Privileges: Castilian merchants given preferential access to Granada's markets\n\nChristian Captives: Immediate release of all Christian prisoners held in Granada (~300 people)\n\nReligious Freedom: Allow limited Christian missionary activity in Granada, protected by law\n\nSymbolic Submission: Formal recognition of Castilian \"overlordship\" (vague, but symbolically significant)\n\nGradual Conversion: Propose peaceful path to conversion over generations rather than conquest\n\nAdditional Sweeteners:\n\nGranada's renowned silk production given to Castilian royal monopoly\n\nAssistance against Mediterranean piracy\n\nIntelligence sharing about North African politics\n\nPersonal gifts of extraordinary value to the king\n\nThe Embassy Departs - September 10\n\nAbu Abdullah al-Zaghal led a prestigious delegation of twelve, carrying gifts worth 20,000 dinars:\n\nSilk tapestries of extraordinary craftsmanship\n\nIlluminated Quranic manuscripts (as art, to show Granada's culture)\n\nAndalusian horses of finest breeding\n\nScientific instruments (astrolabes, celestial globes)\n\nA ceremonial sword with jeweled hilt\n\n\"Remember,\" the Sultan instructed him, \"you represent a proud kingdom seeking honorable peace, not a defeated realm begging for mercy. Offer these terms with dignity. If he refuses, at least we offered.\"\n\nThe embassy will arrive in Seville in late September, after Juan returns. The player will encounter this diplomatic mission and must decide how to respond.\n\nAction 3: The Call to the Muslim World - CRITICAL SUCCESS\n\nThe Urgent Appeals - August 25-30\n\nSultan Muhammad IX sent embassies racing across the Muslim world with desperate appeals:\n\nTo Fez (Marinid Morocco):\n\"The Christians unite under papal banner to destroy the last Muslim kingdom in Al-Andalus. If Granada falls, who is next? The faith itself is threatened. Send warriors, send gold, send ships. Stand with your brothers.\"\n\nTo Tunis (Hafsid Tunisia):\n\"The Pope calls crusade against Islam. Granada is the target today, but the precedent threatens all Muslims. Support us now, or face Christian expansion later.\"\n\nTo Cairo (Mamluk Egypt):\n\"You are the greatest Muslim power. When the Sultan of Granada calls for aid against crusaders, will Cairo remain silent? Your support would echo across the Muslim world.\"\n\nTo Constantinople/Edirne (Ottoman Empire):\n\"Sultan Murad, you fight Christians in the Balkans. We fight them in Iberia. We are two fronts in the same war. Coordinate with us, support us, and together we contain Christendom.\"\n\nThe Unexpected Response\n\nWhat Sultan Muhammad IX expected: polite letters, perhaps token support from Morocco, little else.\n\nWhat he received: a wave of solidarity that shocked even him.\n\nMorocco - Immediate Commitment (Early September)\n\nSultan Abu Muhammad Abd al-Haqq of Morocco responded with startling speed and generosity:\n\n\"Granada is the jewel of Al-Andalus. If it falls, Islam loses not just a kingdom but a symbol. Morocco commits:\n\n5,000 professional troops (including 1,000 cavalry)\n\nNaval support - 15 war galleys\n\n50,000 dinars in gold\n\nContinued support for duration of conflict\"\n\nWhy This Extraordinary Response?\n\nThe Marinid Dynasty had been in decline, facing internal challenges. But the papal crusade gave Sultan Abd al-Haqq an opportunity:\n\nRally his own fractious nobles around external threat\n\nRestore Morocco's prestige as defender of Islam\n\nMaintain Morocco's strategic interest in Iberian affairs\n\nReligious obligation - this wasn't just politics, it was jihad\n\nThe commitment was real, substantial, and immediate. Moroccan troops would begin crossing the Strait of Gibraltar by mid-September.\n\nTunisia - Financial & Naval Support (Early September)\n\nThe Hafsid Sultan Abu Faris Abd al-Aziz of Tunisia sent:\n\n30,000 dinars in gold\n\nDiplomatic letters to other Muslim powers supporting Granada\n\nPromise of additional naval support (5-8 galleys)\n\nReligious scholars to help maintain morale and unity\n\nHis letter emphasized: \"The crusade against Granada is a crusade against Islam. Tunis stands with its western brothers.\"\n\nEgypt - Prestige & Resources (Early September)\n\nSultan Barsbay of the Mamluk Sultanate, the most powerful Muslim ruler, surprised everyone with substantial support:\n\n100,000 dinars in gold (massive sum)\n\nDiplomatic pressure on Christian Mediterranean powers\n\nMilitary advisors and engineers\n\nReligious declaration that fighting for Granada was jihad equivalent to fighting for the holy places\n\nWhy? The Mamluks saw opportunity:\n\nDemonstrate leadership of Muslim world\n\nCreate western front against Christendom (complementing their Eastern concerns)\n\nReligious prestige - supporting embattled Muslim kingdom\n\nStrategic interest - anything that occupies Christian attention helps Mamluks elsewhere\n\nThe Ottoman Response - Surprising Engagement (Early September)\n\nSultan Murad II, busy conquering the Balkans, couldn't send troops. But he sent something almost as valuable:\n\n\"Granada defends Islam's western frontier as we defend its eastern frontier. We are brothers in struggle. Accept:\n\n20,000 dinars in gold\n\nMaster gunners and cannon technology\n\nIntelligence about Christian military capabilities\n\nDiplomatic coordination against our common enemies\"\n\nThe Ottomans saw Granada as a strategic distraction for Christendom. Every Christian soldier fighting in Iberia was one not fighting in the Balkans.\n\nAcross the Muslim World - Volunteers & Support\n\nNews of the papal crusade sparked religious fervor across the dar al-Islam:\n\nVolunteers: Warriors from across the Maghreb began journeying to Granada. Perhaps 2,000-3,000 would arrive over coming months.\n\nReligious Scholars: Issued fatwas declaring fighting for Granada to be jihad, with spiritual rewards equal to defending Mecca\n\nMerchant Support: Muslim traders contributed funds, supplies, weapons\n\nNaval Corsairs: North African corsairs offered their services for raids on Christian shipping\n\nThe Material Result - Early September\n\nBy the time Juan II prepared to sail from Barcelona to Seville, Granada had secured:\n\nMilitary Support:\n\n5,000 Moroccan professional troops (arriving mid-September)\n\n1,000 Moroccan cavalry\n\n2,000-3,000 volunteers from across Muslim world (arriving gradually)\n\nTotal foreign support: ~8,000 troops eventually\n\n20-25 war galleys (naval support from Morocco, Tunisia, corsairs)\n\nOttoman cannon technology and gunners\n\nFinancial Support:\n\n50,000 dinars from Morocco\n\n30,000 dinars from Tunisia\n\n100,000 dinars from Egypt\n\n20,000 dinars from Ottomans\n\n~20,000 dinars from various other sources\n\nTotal: 220,000 dinars (more than Granada's entire annual surplus)\n\nStrategic Support:\n\nReligious legitimacy - fighting for Granada declared jihad\n\nDiplomatic coordination across Muslim world\n\nIntelligence sharing\n\nTechnology transfer (Ottoman cannon expertise)\n\nOngoing commitments for sustained support\n\nThe Sultan's Reaction - September 10\n\nSultan Muhammad IX stood in the Alhambra, reading the latest confirmation. Cairo's gold had arrived. Moroccan troops were crossing the Strait. Ottoman engineers were en route.\n\nGrand Vizier Yusuf ibn Ahmad spoke with wonder: \"My lord, I... I did not think this possible. The Muslim world is fragmented, distant, facing its own challenges. Yet they respond as if Granada's fight is their fight.\"\n\n\"Because it is,\" the Sultan replied quietly. \"The Pope called crusade. That word echoes across centuries - Jerusalem, Antioch, Constantinople. Every Muslim ruler knows what crusade means. And they know: if Granada falls to crusade, where does it end?\"\n\n\"We have the resources to fight now. Truly fight.\"\n\n\"We have more than resources. We have legitimacy. Religious purpose. This is no longer one kingdom defending itself. This is the dar al-Islam standing together against crusade.\" Muhammad IX looked out over his city. \"The young King of Castile brought the Pope's blessing. We have brought the Muslim world's blessing. This will be a war the likes of which Iberia has not seen in generations.\"\n\n\"Can we win?\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen. But now, at least, we have a chance.\"\n\nThe Strategic Situation - September 10, 1430\n\nGranada's Military Position\n\nTotal Forces Available:\n\n8,000 professional Granadan troops (well-trained, experienced)\n\n8,000 militia (poorly trained, but bodies)\n\n5,000 Moroccan professionals (arriving mid-late September)\n\n1,000 Moroccan cavalry\n\n2,000-3,000 Muslim volunteers (arriving gradually)\n\nTotal: approximately 24,000-25,000 troops (when fully assembled)\n\nNaval Forces:\n\n20-25 war galleys (can raid Castilian coast, disrupt supply)\n\nExperienced corsair captains\n\nControl of Strait of Gibraltar challenged but contested\n\nFortifications:\n\nAlhambra (virtually impregnable)\n\nGranada city walls (strong, recently maintained)\n\nFrontier castles (partially improved, but incomplete work)\n\nMountain terrain favoring defense\n\nTechnology:\n\nOttoman cannon technology incoming\n\nExperienced siege engineers from across Muslim world\n\nAdvanced mathematics and engineering capabilities\n\nGranada's Economic Position\n\nTreasury Status:\n\nLost 80,000 dinars to failed mobilization\n\nGained 220,000 dinars from Muslim world support\n\nNet position: +140,000 dinars ahead (plus ongoing Moroccan support)\n\nCan sustain extended conflict\n\nEconomic disruption from mobilization ongoing but manageable\n\nGranada's Political Position\n\nInternal:\n\nSome discontent from rushed mobilization\n\nBut religious fervor rising as jihad declared\n\nPopulation rallying around defense of Islam\n\nMerchants and farmers accepting sacrifices for holy cause\n\nExternal:\n\nUnprecedented support from Muslim world\n\nReligious legitimacy and moral high ground\n\nDiplomatic backing from major powers\n\nThis is no longer isolated kingdom - it's a cause\n\nThe Strategic Balance\n\nGranada's Advantages:\n\nStrong defensive position (terrain, fortifications)\n\nMore troops than historically available\n\nSubstantial financial resources\n\nNaval capability for coastal raids\n\nReligious unity and purpose\n\nSupport from broader Muslim world\n\nTime to continue preparations before crusade launches\n\nGranada's Disadvantages:\n\nStill outnumbered by potential Castilian forces\n\nFailed mobilization left internal strain\n\nRushed preparations incomplete\n\nMilitia poorly trained\n\nCastile has papal backing (religious legitimacy on their side too)\n\nCastile has superior resources long-term\n\nGranada's Muslim allies are distant - ongoing support uncertain\n\nStatus at Current Date - September 10, 1430\n\nGranada's Position:\n\nBetter prepared than any Muslim kingdom facing crusade in recent memory\n\n24,000-25,000 troops available (when fully assembled)\n\n220,000 dinars in gold received\n\nNaval forces for coastal defense and raiding\n\nStrong fortifications and defensive terrain\n\nReligious declaration of jihad unifying Muslim world\n\nDiplomatic mission preparing to offer peace terms to Juan II\n\nWhat Granada Achieved:\nDespite military mobilization's failure, the CRITICAL SUCCESS in securing Muslim support transformed Granada's strategic position. The kingdom went from isolated and desperate to being the banner-bearer for Islam's resistance to crusade. This is now a religious war on both sides.\n\nWhat Awaits Juan II:\nWhen the young king returns to Seville with his papal crusade bull and sacred relics, he will face:\n\nA diplomatic mission offering generous peace terms\n\nIntelligence reports of massive Muslim support for Granada\n\nNews of Moroccan troops arriving\n\nEvidence that his crusade has sparked counter-crusade (jihad)\n\nA much more formidable enemy than he anticipated\n\nThe stage is set for religious war of unprecedented scale in Iberian history.\n\nEnd of Granada Response\n\nThe Sultan has made his moves. Military preparation partially failed, but the critical success in rallying Muslim world support transformed everything.\n\nKey Points for Player:\n\nGranada has ~24,000 troops (vs. historical ~12,000-15,000)\n\nGranada has 220,000 dinars in foreign support\n\nThis is now an Islamic jihad vs. Christian crusade (escalated religious conflict)\n\nDiplomatic mission will arrive in Seville offering peace terms\n\nThe crusade will be harder than expected\n\nReady to return to Juan's perspective in Barcelona?"

        },

          "role": "gm",
          "text": "You're right - I need to check the timeline. Looking at Chapter 3, Juan is in Rome on August 1, 1430, having just received the crusade bull. He's planning to depart August 2 for Florence, then Pisa, then sail to Barcelona, arriving late August, then staying 2-3 weeks before sailing to Seville in mid-September.\n\nSo we're at the very beginning of his journey home, not the end. My mistake in the previous response's framing.\n\nNow, for introducing struggles/temptations/accidents for Juan - this is a great storytelling opportunity. Medieval monarchs faced many challenges:\n\n**Physical/Health Issues:**\n- Illness (dysentery, fever, plague, food poisoning)\n- Injury (falling from horse, training accident, violence)\n- Exhaustion from travel\n- Poor medical care leading to complications\n\n**Moral/Spiritual Temptations:**\n- Pride (especially after papal triumph)\n- Lust (common for young men, especially kings)\n- Wrath/vengeance (toward the Infantes)\n- Vanity about his spiritual achievement\n- Using religion as manipulation rather than true faith\n\n**Political Challenges:**\n- Assassination attempts\n- Spies and informants\n- Betrayal by companions\n- Diplomatic incidents\n- Running out of money\n\n**Personal Struggles:**\n- Doubt about his certainty/divine guidance\n- Guilt about his methods (deception, etc.)\n- Fear of failure\n- Loneliness of command\n- Youth and inexperience showing\n\nGiven Juan's character development so far, I think the most interesting challenges would be:\n\n1. **Pride/Spiritual Pride** - After the papal triumph, he's feeling very certain about God's will. This could lead to dangerous overconfidence. Fray Hernando has already warned about this.\n\n2. **Temptation of the Flesh** - He's 18, he's just had an incredible spiritual/political triumph, he's been celibate, he's in Italy where Renaissance culture is flowering. \n\nA seductive encounter could profoundly challenge Juan's spiritual resolve. An alluring woman might strategically approach him, testing his commitment to the crusade's sacred vows. Her beauty and subtle advances would create intense internal conflict between his physical desires and spiritual dedication.\n\n3. **Physical Vulnerability** - A minor injury during travel could dramatically expose his human frailty. Perhaps a horse-riding accident or a sudden illness that temporarily weakens him, forcing his companions to recognize his youth and mortality.\n\n4. **Financial Pressures** - Unexpected expenses threaten the journey's momentum. Diplomatic gifts, travel costs, and maintaining his entourage strain his limited resources, adding practical complexity to his mission.\n\n5. **Potential Assassination Risk** - Shadowy threats from the Infantes or political rivals could create constant underlying tension, reminding Juan of the precarious nature of his position.\n\nI envision interweaving these challenges to create a nuanced narrative of personal growth, spiritual testing, and political navigation.\n\nIntroducing Challenges for Juan II\n\nYou're absolutely right about the timeline - Juan is in Rome on August 1-2, about to depart for Florence. And yes, some struggles would add depth and realism.\n\nCommon Medieval Monarch Problems\n\nPhysical/Health:\n\nIllness (dysentery, fevers, food poisoning - medieval travel was dangerous)\n\nInjuries (horse accidents, training mishaps, violence)\n\nExhaustion and malnutrition from extended travel\n\nPoor medical care turning minor issues into major ones\n\nMoral/Spiritual:\n\nPride after triumph (especially dangerous for Juan right now)\n\nLust (he's 18, celibate, just had euphoric experience)\n\nWrath (desire for vengeance against the Infantes)\n\nSpiritual pride (believing too strongly in his own divine favor)\n\nHypocrisy (using faith as tool while claiming purity)\n\nPolitical:\n\nAssassination attempts\n\nSpies and betrayals\n\nDiplomatic incidents creating complications\n\nRunning out of money\n\nCompanions proving unreliable\n\nPersonal:\n\nDoubt creeping in after certainty\n\nFear of failure\n\nLoneliness of command\n\nYouth showing at critical moments\n\nProposed Challenges for Juan's Journey Home\n\nGiven Juan's character arc (mixing genuine piety with political calculation, warned repeatedly about pride, absolute certainty about success), I propose three potential challenges that would test different aspects of his character:\n\nOption 1: The Temptation - Pride and Certainty\n\nWhat Happens: In Florence or along the road, Juan's absolute certainty about God's favor starts manifesting as dangerous pride. He:\n\nDismisses reasonable caution from his advisors\n\nTakes unnecessary risks believing God will protect him\n\nBegins treating his companions as servants rather than brothers\n\nMakes decisions based on \"feeling God's will\" without counsel\n\nThe white garments become symbol of purity he's proud of rather than humble service\n\nFray Hernando confronts him: \"Your Majesty, you are changing. After Rome you were humble. Now you speak as if God's favor makes you infallible. This is spiritual pride - the most dangerous sin.\"\n\nChallenge: Juan must recognize and overcome his pride before it leads to disaster. Does he listen to counsel or continue believing his certainty equals divine guarantee?\n\nOption 2: The Temptation - Lust\n\nWhat Happens: In Florence (center of Renaissance culture and beauty), Juan encounters a situation that tests his commitment to purity:\n\nScenario A - The Merchant's Daughter:\nA wealthy Florentine banker hosting Juan has a beautiful, educated daughter (unusual for the time - Renaissance flowering). She's genuinely impressed by Juan's story, curious about his faith, intellectually engaging. Nothing improper happens, but Juan feels attraction. She's marriage-eligible, politically useful, and available. The temptation isn't crude - it's the possibility of legitimate romance at exactly the wrong time.\n\nScenario B - Calculated Seduction:\nA courtesan or noblewoman (possibly working for the Infantes' spies) deliberately attempts to seduce the young king. She's sophisticated, beautiful, and knows exactly how to appeal to an 18-year-old who's just had the most intense spiritual experience of his life and is feeling invincible. The attempt could be to:\n\nCompromise him morally (destroy his \"pure warrior\" image)\n\nGather intelligence\n\nDelay his return\n\nCreate scandal\n\nChallenge: Juan must navigate attraction, political implications, and his commitment to remaining focused on the crusade. At 18, with hormones, after an emotional high, this is genuinely difficult.\n\nOption 3: Physical Danger - Injury or Illness\n\nWhat Happens: Something reminds Juan viscerally that he is mortal and vulnerable:\n\nScenario A - Training Accident:\nSparring with Sir Thomas or Captain Fernán, Juan takes a hard fall or gets hit solidly. Not life-threatening but painful - cracked rib, badly twisted ankle, concussion. He's laid up for days, in pain, unable to travel. Forces him to confront: what if he's injured in actual battle? What if he dies before completing the crusade?\n\nScenario B - Illness:\nMedieval travel is dangerous. Juan contracts fever, dysentery, or food poisoning. Days of misery, weakness, unable to keep food down. The sacred relics and crusade bull sit locked nearby while he's too weak to continue. Mortality becomes very real.\n\nScenario C - Assassination Attempt:\nSomeone tries to kill him. Could be:\n\nInfantes' agent\n\nMuslim spy from Granada\n\nRandom bandit who doesn't know who he is\n\nDisgruntled noble's hired killer\n\nThe attempt fails (or we roll for it), but it shakes Juan badly. He realizes how fragile his entire plan is - one blade, one arrow, and everything collapses.\n\nChallenge: Juan must deal with fear, recognize his own vulnerability, and decide whether his certainty about divine protection means he's truly invulnerable or whether he's been dangerously naive.\n\nOption 4: Practical Crisis - Money\n\nWhat Happens: The journey is expensive and unexpected costs mount:\n\nLost horses need replacement\n\nInn costs higher than expected\n\nBribes necessary at certain borders\n\nGuards require bonuses\n\nDiplomatic gifts depleting funds\n\nCurrency exchange problems\n\nBy the time they reach Florence or Barcelona, funds are dangerously low. Juan might need to:\n\nBorrow from Italian bankers (creates debt, obligations)\n\nSell some of the jewelry he gave to Captain Fernán\n\nSend urgent message to Álvaro for funds (creates vulnerability)\n\nAccept \"hospitality\" that comes with strings attached\n\nChallenge: Reminds Juan that holy missions still require mundane resources. Tests his practical judgment against his spiritual focus.\n\nMy Recommendation: Combine Two\n\nI suggest combining:\n\nPride/Certainty (internal, spiritual, building on established themes)\n\nPhysical Vulnerability (external, practical, grounding moment)\n\nNarrative Flow:\n\nFlorence: Juan's pride begins showing (after papal triumph high)\n\nOn road to Pisa or in Pisa: Something happens (injury, illness, or attempt) that breaks through his certainty\n\nForces moment of humility and recalibration before Barcelona\n\nHe arrives in Barcelona more balanced - confident but not arrogant\n\nQuestions for You:\n\nWhich challenge(s) interest you most? Pride? Lust? Physical danger? Money problems? Combination?\n\nHow severe should it be? Minor stumble he recovers from quickly? Serious challenge that takes days/weeks to overcome? Near-disaster?\n\nShould we roll for it? Or would you prefer to choose the challenge and then roll for how well Juan handles it?\n\nTiming? Should it happen in Florence (early in journey home)? On the road? In Pisa? During sea voyage? In Barcelona?\n\nLet me know your preference and we'll develop it into the narrative!"

          "text": "For exhaustion/malnutrition:\n1. The grinding accumulation - months of travel catching up\n2. Specific dietary deficiency (scurvy, vitamin deficiency)\n3. Combination of physical training, travel, stress, poor sleep\n4. Religious fasting taken too far\n5. Refusing to rest/eat properly due to urgency\n6. Poor food quality on the road\n\nFor spies/betrayals:\n1. One of the guards is actually a spy\n2. Someone in the party is reporting to the Infantes\n3. External spy infiltrating the group\n4. A trusted host is actually working for enemies\n5. Correspondence being intercepted\n6. Someone being blackmailed/coerced into betrayal\n7. Accidental betrayal - someone talks too much\n\nLet me develop these into specific, rollable scenarios.\n\nChallenge Scenarios for Juan II\n\nChallenge 1: Exhaustion and Malnutrition\n\nScenario A: The Accumulated Toll\n\nWhat's Happening: Four months of constant travel (Santiago → France → Italy → Rome) has simply worn Juan down. He's 18, still growing, and has been:\n\nRising at dawn for prayers and travel\n\nTraining in combat regularly with Captain Fernán\n\nSleeping in different beds (or on the ground) every few nights\n\nEating irregular meals of varying quality\n\nUnder constant mental/emotional stress\n\nWalking/riding 15-25 miles most days\n\nSpecific Symptoms:\n\nChronic fatigue that sleep doesn't fix\n\nDifficulty concentrating during important meetings\n\nSlower reflexes (dangerous if combat training continues)\n\nMinor wounds healing slowly\n\nIncreased irritability\n\nPale complexion, dark circles under eyes\n\nWhen It Manifests: Gradually worsening from Rome through Florence. By Pisa, it's undeniable.\n\nConsequences if Ignored: Could collapse, become seriously ill, make poor decisions due to exhaustion.\n\nScenario B: The Fasting Crisis\n\nWhat's Happening: Juan has been fasting more than is healthy. After the profound spiritual experience in Rome, he's intensified his religious discipline:\n\nFasting two days per week (beyond Church requirements)\n\nEating only one meal on other days\n\nRefusing meat as additional penance\n\nCombining this with physical training and travel\n\nSpecific Symptoms:\n\nSignificant weight loss (visible to his companions)\n\nWeakness and dizziness\n\nDifficulty staying on horse for long rides\n\nHands trembling during sword practice\n\nMental fog and difficulty with complex thinking\n\nWhen It Manifests: Becomes acute in Florence when he nearly faints during Mass.\n\nFray Hernando's Reaction: \"Your Majesty, God does not require you to destroy the body He gave you. You cannot lead a crusade if you're too weak to sit a horse. This is not piety - it's pride disguised as devotion.\"\n\nConsequences if Ignored: Serious malnutrition, potential organ damage, inability to continue journey.\n\nScenario C: The Road Diet Reality\n\nWhat's Happening: The food available during medieval travel is genuinely inadequate:\n\nMostly hard bread, dried meat, cheese (when available)\n\nLittle fresh fruit or vegetables (scurvy risk)\n\nWater quality varies dangerously\n\nMany meals skipped due to urgent travel\n\nSometimes forced to eat spoiled food or go hungry\n\nSpecific Symptoms:\n\nBleeding gums (early scurvy from vitamin C deficiency)\n\nLoose teeth\n\nBruising easily\n\nStomach problems from bad water/food\n\nGeneral weakness\n\nSkin problems\n\nWhen It Manifests: Gradually worsens. Sergeant García notices Juan's gums bleeding when eating in Florence.\n\nMedieval Reality: Even kings on campaign suffered from this. Fresh food was luxury on long journeys.\n\nConsequences if Ignored: Scurvy can become severe, teeth can fall out, infections can develop.\n\nScenario D: The Sleepless King\n\nWhat's Happening: Juan isn't sleeping properly:\n\nNightmares about failing the crusade\n\nAnxiety about what's happening in Castile\n\nPraying for hours instead of sleeping\n\nDifferent beds/conditions preventing deep sleep\n\nExcitement/anxiety about returning home\n\nGuard duties disrupting sleep schedule (he insists on taking turns)\n\nSpecific Symptoms:\n\nSevere sleep deprivation (averaging 3-4 hours per night)\n\nMicrosleeping during the day\n\nImpaired judgment and decision-making\n\nEmotional volatility\n\nHallucinations if severe enough\n\nNearly falling from horse due to drowsiness\n\nWhen It Manifests: Crisis point when Juan falls asleep during crucial meeting with Florentine bankers.\n\nMedieval Context: Sleep disorders were common but poorly understood. \"Melancholia\" or \"an imbalance of humors\" would be diagnosis.\n\nConsequences if Ignored: Serious mental/physical impairment, dangerous accidents, poor leadership decisions.\n\nScenario E: The Refusal to Rest\n\nWhat's Happening: Juan is pushing the pace too hard due to urgency:\n\nNews of Infantes' revolt makes him desperate to return\n\nFeels every day delayed risks losing kingdom\n\nRefuses rest days even when clearly needed\n\nPushes through minor illnesses instead of recovering\n\nForces march pace on his companions\n\nSpecific Crisis: \nDuring push from Florence to Pisa, Juan insists on maintaining brutal pace. He's visibly exhausted, swaying in saddle, but refuses to stop. Finally, Captain Fernán has enough:\n\n\"Your Majesty, with respect - stop. Now. You're going to kill yourself or your horse or both.\"\n\n\"We must reach—\"\n\n\"We must reach Seville with a living king, not a corpse! You've been in the saddle ten hours. You haven't eaten since dawn. You're gray as ash. We stop. That's not a suggestion.\"\n\nThe Mutiny: Juan's own guards refuse to continue until he rests properly. Gentle mutiny out of loyalty.\n\nConsequences if Ignored: Horse gives out, Juan collapses, or serious injury from impaired reflexes.\n\nScenario F: The Combination Effect\n\nWhat's Happening: Multiple factors combining into crisis:\n\nSome fasting (religious discipline)\n\nPoor road food (lack of nutrition)\n\nInadequate sleep (stress and urgency)\n\nConstant physical exertion (riding, training)\n\nEmotional/mental stress (weight of mission)\n\nMinor illness (fever, stomach trouble) making everything worse\n\nSpecific Crisis: In Pisa, everything hits at once. Juan develops fever, can't keep food down, hasn't slept properly in days, is visibly wasting away. Fray Hernando and Captain Fernán confront him:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you are not invincible. The white garments will bear the stains of service - but you must survive to wear them. We're staying in Pisa until you've recovered. No arguments.\"\n\nThe Forced Rest: Party stays in Pisa 5-7 days (instead of planned 2) while Juan recovers.\n\nConsequences if Ignored: Complete breakdown, potentially serious long-term health effects.\n\nChallenge 2: Spies and Betrayals\n\nScenario A: The Guard's Secret\n\nWho: One of the four additional guards (Martín or Felipe) is secretly sending information to the Infantes.\n\nBackground:\n\nThe guard is not malicious - his family is in debt to one of the Infantes' allies\n\nThreatened that family will lose lands/be imprisoned unless he reports\n\nSends letters at each major city describing Juan's movements, meetings, state of mind\n\nDoesn't have access to the crusade bull itself (that's guarded by the core four)\n\nGenuinely likes Juan and feels terrible about betrayal\n\nHow It's Discovered:\n\nJuan's intelligence network (Juan de Daza or Diego Gómez) sends warning: \"Infantes seem to know details of your journey they shouldn't\"\n\nOR the guard is observed sending a letter in Florence/Pisa\n\nOR he confesses, guilt-ridden, before reaching Barcelona\n\nThe Dilemma:\n\nExecute him? (Betrayal deserves death by medieval standards)\n\nImprison him? (Creates complications during travel)\n\nUse him to feed false information? (Risky if he's more loyal to blackmailers)\n\nForgive him and help his family? (Shows mercy but might encourage others)\n\nSeverity: Moderate - damaging but not catastrophic. Infantes know Juan's route and timing but not strategic details.\n\nScenario B: The Trusted Host's Game\n\nWho: One of the prestigious hosts (Florentine banker, Pisan merchant, or Barcelona noble) is playing multiple sides.\n\nBackground:\n\nPublicly welcomes Juan with great honor\n\nPrivately sends reports to Infantes (and possibly Granada)\n\nMotivated by: profit (playing all sides), political hedging (backing potential winners), or genuine belief Infantes are better for Castile\n\nHas access to information from conversations during hospitality\n\nHow It's Discovered:\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont (experienced, cynical) notices host's servant asking too many questions\n\nLetter is intercepted being sent to Aragon\n\nLater intelligence reveals host has been corresponding with Infantes' faction\n\nHost himself might confess if confronted, claiming \"just keeping informed\"\n\nThe Dilemma:\n\nConfront the host publicly? (Diplomatic incident in foreign city)\n\nLeave quietly without revealing discovery? (Preserve relations but they keep operating)\n\nHave the host \"dealt with\"? (Dangerous and possibly unjust)\n\nUse the host to feed misinformation? (Complex but potentially valuable)\n\nSeverity: Moderate - reveals Juan's plans and vulnerabilities but doesn't directly threaten him.\n\nScenario C: The Intercepted Correspondence\n\nWhat's Happening: Letters between Juan and Álvaro are being intercepted and read before being resealed.\n\nWho's Doing It:\n\nAgents in the postal/messenger network (bribed by Infantes)\n\nSomeone in Juan's own party passing information about correspondence\n\nForeign intelligence services (Italian city-states love information)\n\nWhat They Learn:\n\nDetails about the crusade bull before public announcement\n\nJuan's assessment of internal Castilian politics\n\nÁlvaro's reports about the Infantes' failed revolt\n\nStrategic plans for Royal Council in November\n\nFinancial information\n\nHow It's Discovered:\n\nÁlvaro mentions something in a letter that Juan never wrote\n\nDetails from \"private\" letters appear in Infantes' propaganda\n\nA seal shows signs of tampering\n\nCoded portions are decoded (someone has the cipher)\n\nThe Consequences:\n\nInfantes are preparing counter-strategies based on Juan's plans\n\nGranada might learn details about crusade preparations\n\nJuan's privacy is violated (personal as well as political)\n\nFuture correspondence cannot be trusted\n\nSeverity: Serious - strategic information is compromised.\n\nScenario D: The Confessor's Dilemma\n\nWhat's Happening: Someone attempts to corrupt or pressure Fray Hernando to reveal confession secrets.\n\nWho Attempts It:\n\nInfantes' agent offers substantial bribe to Hieronymite Order\n\nThreatened with investigation of \"heresies\" unless he cooperates\n\nAppealed to as \"saving Castile from unstable king\"\n\nSomeone tries to plant a spy in Fray Hernando's confidence\n\nWhat They Want:\n\nJuan's confession contents (major sin - but valuable intelligence)\n\nAssessment of Juan's mental state\n\nDetails about Rome meeting\n\nPrivate conversations about strategy\n\nFray Hernando's Response:\n\nAbsolute refusal - seal of confession is inviolable\n\nBut he's shaken by the attempt\n\nWarns Juan: \"Someone is trying to get to you through me\"\n\nCreates trust issue - who approached the confessor?\n\nThe Investigation:\nIf Juan investigates who tried to corrupt his confessor, it might reveal larger spy network.\n\nSeverity: Moderate threat (failed) but reveals vulnerability and creates paranoia.\n\nScenario E: The Barcelona Trap\n\nWhat's Happening: When Juan arrives in Barcelona (King Alfonso V's city), he walks into sophisticated intelligence operation.\n\nThe Setup:\n\nBarcelona authorities (loyal to Alfonso V) track Juan's every move\n\nHis lodgings are observed constantly\n\nServants are questioned about conversations\n\nGifts given contain hidden purposes (beautiful books with encoded messages for allies, etc.)\n\n\"Friendly\" nobles are actually gathering intelligence\n\nWhat Alfonso V Wants:\n\nAssess his young cousin's character and plans\n\nUnderstand extent of papal backing\n\nGauge whether Juan is threat or opportunity\n\nGather leverage for future negotiations\n\nInformation to share with his brothers (the Infantes)\n\nThe Uncomfortable Reality:\nJuan must stay in Barcelona (it's on the route, it's a major port). He knows he's under observation. Alfonso V might even grant him audience - but it's on Alfonso's territory, under Alfonso's terms.\n\nHow Juan Discovers Full Extent:\n\nSir Thomas (experienced in courtly espionage) warns him\n\nDiego (secretary) notices patterns in who asks questions\n\nA friendly Barcelona merchant warns Juan quietly\n\nAfter leaving, Álvaro's intelligence reveals what was gathered\n\nThe Dilemma:\n\nConfront Alfonso V? (Weak position, foreign city)\n\nPlay along and feed misinformation? (Risky if they see through it)\n\nCut visit short? (Suspicious and might miss opportunities)\n\nUse visit to send own message? (Show strength despite surveillance)\n\nSeverity: Significant - Juan is exposed and vulnerable in potentially hostile territory.\n\nScenario F: The Companion's Crisis\n\nWho: Someone close to Juan (possibly Diego the secretary, or even Sir Thomas) is approached with offer/threat they can't easily refuse.\n\nThe Approach:\nA sophisticated operative contacts them privately:\n\n\"We know about [insert leverage: debt, family in danger, past crime, secret they want hidden]. You will provide information, or consequences will follow. We don't ask you to betray the king - just to report objectively what you observe. You are serving Castile by ensuring wise counselors have full information.\"\n\nWhat They Want:\n\nDetailed reports on Juan's health, mood, decision-making\n\nAdvance warning of plans and movements\n\nAccess to documents if possible\n\nAssessment of vulnerabilities\n\nThe Inner Turmoil:\nThe person genuinely serves Juan but faces impossible choice. They might:\n\nConfess immediately to Juan (requires courage)\n\nTry to provide minimal information while protecting themselves\n\nCave completely under pressure\n\nAttempt to deceive both sides (very dangerous)\n\nHow Juan Discovers:\n\nPerson confesses tearfully\n\nJuan notices person acting strangely\n\nIntelligence warning from Castile\n\nPerson is caught in the act\n\nThe Moral Question:\nThis person didn't seek betrayal - they were trapped. How does Juan respond? With:\n\nUnderstanding and protection? (Shows mercy but maybe encourages weakness)\n\nHarsh punishment? (Medieval standard but breaks someone who could have been loyal)\n\nClever use of the situation? (Turn them into double agent)\n\nSeverity: High - someone very close to Juan is compromised, creating trust crisis.\n\nQuestions for You:\n\nFor Exhaustion/Malnutrition:\n\nWhich scenario sounds most interesting? Or would you like to combine elements?\n\nHow severe should it be - minor setback or serious health crisis?\n\nShould we roll for which specific scenario, or would you like to choose?\n\nFor Spies/Betrayals:\n\nWhich scenario creates best dramatic tension?\n\nSingle spy/betrayal or multiple issues?\n\nShould we roll for severity, or do you want to select specific scenario?\n\nIs one of the core companions (Captain Fernán, Fray Hernando, Sergeant García, Corporal Rodrigo) off-limits, or could even they be compromised somehow?\n\nI can develop whichever scenarios you choose into full narrative sections with probability assessments for how Juan handles them!"

          "text": "1. **The Infantes' Revolt** (May-September 1430):\n   - Result: FAILURE\n   - They control: Arévalo fortress, two minor castles, ~3,000 household troops, support from 6-8 noble houses (~12%)\n   - They failed to: seize major cities, capture Álvaro, win significant noble support, control revenues\n   - Current state: Exposed as rebels, weakened, must negotiate from weakness at November council\n\n2. **Sultan Muhammad IX's Actions** (August-September 1430):\n   - Military Preparation: FAILURE (partial mobilization, 8,000 militia instead of 10,000, incomplete fortifications, 80,000 dinars spent, internal strain)\n   - Diplomatic Mission: PREPARED (embassy ready to depart for Seville, will arrive after Juan returns)\n   - Muslim World Support: CRITICAL SUCCESS (5,000 Moroccan troops + 1,000 cavalry arriving, 20-25 war galleys, 220,000 dinars in gold from Morocco/Tunisia/Egypt/Ottomans, 2,000-3,000 volunteers, Ottoman cannon technology)\n   - Total forces: ~24,000-25,000 troops when fully assembled\n   - This is now a jihad vs crusade (religious war on both sides)\n\n3. **Juan's Personal Challenges**:\n   - Health: \"The Road Diet Reality\" - malnutrition from poor road food, symptoms include bleeding gums (early scurvy), vitamin deficiency, stomach problems, general weakness\n   - Political: \"The Intercepted Correspondence\" - letters between Juan and Álvaro are being intercepted and read, Infantes learning strategic information\n   \nI recognize the critical need for a comprehensive status document to track the complex narrative. Creating a centralized reference will help maintain narrative consistency and provide a clear overview of the evolving political and military landscape. The document would capture key faction dynamics, strategic positions, and ongoing challenges, ensuring a coherent and detailed game experience.\n\nYes, absolutely! That would be very helpful for maintaining consistency and tracking all the moving pieces. Let me create a comprehensive status document that captures everything we've established.\n\nI'll create this as an artifact so you can reference it easily, and we can update it as the story progresses.\n\nGame State - September 1430\n\n# Kingdom of Castile 1430 - Game State\n## Current Date: September 10, 1430\n\n---\n\n## JUAN II'S POSITION\n\n### Location & Timeline\n- **Current

squire)\n\n### Current Personal Challenges\n\n**Health Issue: \"The Road Diet Reality\"**\n- **Status**: Developing malnutrition from 4 months of travel\n- **Symptoms**: Bleeding gums (early scurvy), vitamin C deficiency, stomach problems from bad water/food, general weakness, bruising easily\n- **Cause**: Poor road food (hard bread, dried meat, little fresh fruit/vegetables), inconsistent meals, contaminated water\n- **Severity**: Not yet crisis but worsening\n- **Needs**: Fresh food, proper rest, better nutrition in Florence/Pisa\n\n**Political Issue: \"The Intercepted Correspondence\"**\n- **Status**: Letters between Juan and Álvaro being intercepted and read\n- **Who**: Unknown (likely Infantes' agents in postal/messenger network)\n- **What They've Learned**: Details about crusade bull, Juan's assessment of Castilian politics, strategic plans for November council, possibly financial information\n- **Consequences**: Infantes preparing counter-strategies based on Juan's private plans\n- **Juan's Knowledge**: Not yet discovered (will be revealed during story)\n\n### Spiritual State\n- High confidence bordering on certainty about divine favor\n- Warned repeatedly by Fray Hernando about spiritual pride\n- Committed to wearing white garments bearing honest stains of service\n- Deep conviction that crusade will succeed\n\n---\n\n## THE INFANTES DE ARAGÓN\n\n### Result of May-September Revolt: FAILURE\n\n**What They Attempted:**\n- Rally nobles against Juan during his absence\n- Seize strategic fortresses and cities\n- Remove/neutralize Álvaro de Luna\n- Establish permanent regency with real power\n- Create facts on ground before Juan's return\n\n**What They Accomplished:**\n- Seized Arévalo fortress\n- Seized 2 minor northern castles\n- Rallied support from 6-8 major noble houses (~12% of great nobility)\n- Maintained support of Master of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán)\n- Created temporary instability\n\n**What They Failed to Achieve:**\n- Did not seize any major city\n- Did not capture or neutralize Álvaro de Luna\n- Did not win over significant neutral nobles (~60% stayed neutral)\n- Did not secure Military Orders' support (Calatrava and Alcántara remained neutral)\n- Did not control royal revenues or administration\n- Did not prevent papal backing for Juan\n- Did not build sustainable coalition\n\n**Current Position (September 1430):**\n- **Military**: ~3,000 household troops, support from 6-8 noble houses (additional ~2,000 troops)\n- **Territory**: Arévalo fortress, 2 minor castles, their own estates\n- **Political**: Exposed as rebels, weakened, isolated\n- **Strategy**: Must negotiate from weakness at November council in Seville\n- **Attitude**: Desperate but not destroyed; dangerous wounded animals\n\n**What They Know (via intercepted letters):**\n- Juan went to Rome (confirmed)\n- Details about crusade bull before public announcement\n- Juan's assessment of their failed revolt\n- Álvaro's reports about Castilian political situation\n- Strategic plans for Royal Council\n- Juan's route and timing of return\n\n**Key Figures:**\n- **Infante Juan de Aragón**: Humiliated, bitter, plotting next moves\n- **Infante Enrique de Aragón**: Still on regency council, more pragmatic\n- **King Alfonso V of Aragon**: In Naples, aware of situation, likely supporting brothers\n\n---\n\n## ÁLVARO DE LUNA & ROYAL ADMINISTRATION\n\n### Successfully Held Kingdom During Juan's Absence\n\n**What Álvaro Accomplished:**\n- Maintained control of Valladolid and royal administration\n- Kept all major cities loyal (Seville, Toledo, Burgos, Salamanca, Segovia, Zamora)\n- Protected royal treasury and archives\n- Countered Infantes' propaganda effectively\n- Intelligence network (Juan's cabinet) functioned well\n- Prevented Infantes from gaining traction\n\n**Current Position:**\n- Controls day-to-day administration\n- Commands loyalty of ~15-20 major houses (~25-30% of great nobility)\n- Strong in urban centers and among merchants\n- Protected by revised regency council structure (unanimous decisions required)\n\n**The Cabinet (Juan's Intelligence Network):**\n- **Juan de Daza**: Treasury official, tracking financial flows and urban intelligence\n- **Diego Gómez de Sandoval, Count of Castro**: Observing court factions\n- **Lope de Barrientos**: Dominican scholar, monitoring Church networks\n- **Íñigo López de Mendoza (younger)**: Poet, observing nobility\n- **Rodrigo Manrique**: Frontier soldier, military intelligence\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Nobility still resents him (low-born upstart)\n- Vulnerable if Juan fails or dies\n- Managing regency council with Infante Enrique still member\n- Detecting and countering spy networks (correspondence interception not yet discovered)\n\n---\n\n## KINGDOM OF CASTILE - GENERAL STATUS\n\n### Political Alignment (September 1430)\n\n**Clearly Pro-Juan (30-35%):**\n- Álvaro de Luna's faction\n- Major cities (Seville, Valladolid, Toledo, etc.)\n- Merchant communities\n- Royal administration\n- Church hierarchy (privately awaiting public confirmation)\n- ~15-20 major noble houses\n\n**Clearly Pro-Infantes (15-20%):**\n- Infantes' household and estates\n- 6-8 major noble houses who joined failed revolt\n- Master of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán)\n- Some northern nobility with Navarre connections\n\n**Neutral/Watching (50-55%):**\n- ~30-35 major noble houses\n- Many minor nobles and knights\n- Military Orders of Calatrava and Alcántara\n- Several important cities (waiting to see papal position)\n- Many bishops and abbots (waiting for official announcement)\n\n### Military Forces Available\n\n**Royal Forces:**\n- ~3,000 royal household troops\n- Garrison forces in major cities\n- Potential feudal levies: 15,000-20,000 (if nobles cooperate)\n\n**Infantes' Forces:**\n- ~5,000 troops total (household + allied nobles)\n- Garrison forces in captured fortresses\n\n**Military Orders:**\n- Santiago: ~2,000 troops (currently with Infantes)\n- Calatrava: ~1,500 troops (neutral)\n- Alcántara: ~1,000 troops (neutral)\n\n**Potential Crusade Army (if nobles unite):**\n- Could raise 25,000-30,000 troops\n- Requires noble cooperation and unified command\n- Papal bull provides legal authority for this\n\n### Economic Status\n- Treasury: Functional (~30 million maravedís annual revenue)\n- Some disruption from Infantes' revolt but limited\n- Crusade taxation authorized by papal bull (not yet implemented)\n- Church revenues (10%) available for crusade financing\n\n---\n\n## KINGDOM OF GRANADA\n\n### Sultan Muhammad IX's Response (August-September 1430)\n\n### Military Preparation: FAILURE\n**What Was Attempted:**\n- Raise 10,000 additional militia beyond 8,000 professional army\n- Stockpile supplies for 6-12 month sieges\n- Improve fortifications on 20 frontier castles\n- Position strategic reserves\n- Hire mercenaries\n\n**What Was Achieved:**\n- 8,000 militia raised (vs. planned 10,000)\n- Militia poorly trained and

Granada has unprecedented resources, legitimacy, and support.\n\n**Sultan's Assessment**: \"We have more than resources. We have legitimacy. Religious purpose. This is no longer one kingdom defending itself. This is the dar al-Islam standing together against crusade.\"\n\n---\n\n## CHURCH POSITION\n\n### Officially:\n- Pope Martin V granted crusade bull to Juan II (August 1, 1430)\n- Papal Legate to be appointed to accompany crusade\n- Vatican provided 20,000 florins, sacred relics, letters to Christian monarchs\n- Church revenues (10% of ecclesiastical properties) authorized for crusade\n\n### Spanish Church Hierarchy:\n- **Archbishop of Toledo**: Received private letter from Cardinal Orsini about papal audience, subtly supporting Juan\n- **Archbishop of Santiago**: Also informed, spreading word through monastic networks\n- **Bishops generally**: Waiting for official announcement but privately shifting to support Juan\n- Church will not support Infantes once crusade bull is public\n\n### Broader Christendom:\n- Letters sent to France, England, Portugal, Aragon, Navarre endorsing crusade\n- Diplomatic pressure on King Alfonso V to support (not hinder) the crusade\n- Pope Martin V personally invested in Juan's success as final legacy\n\n---\n\n## FOREIGN POWERS\n\n### Kingdom of Aragon\n- **King Alfonso V**: In Naples, focused on Italian ambitions\n- **Position**: Likely supports his brothers (the Infantes) but cautiously\n- **Received**: Diplomatic letter from Juan about removing Infante Juan from council\n- **Threat Level**: Could provide support to Infantes if situation escalates\n- **Complication**: Pope's letters urge him to support crusade, not hinder it\n\n### Kingdom of Navarre\n- **King**: Infante Juan de Aragón (one of Juan's antagonists)\n- **Position**: Hostile to Juan II\n- **Territory**: Allowed Infantes' agents to operate, watched Juan's passage through\n- **Resources**: Can provide troops and sanctuary to his brother Enrique\n\n### Kingdom of Portugal\n- **King João I**: Age 73, nearing end of reign\n- **Heir**: Duarte (son)\n- **Position**: Neutral, wealthy from African trade\n- **Potential**: Alliance possible, marriage prospects available\n\n### Morocco (Marinid Dynasty)\n- **Sultan Abd al-Haqq**: Committed major support to Granada\n- **Troops**: 5,000 infantry + 1,000 cavalry arriving in Granada\n- **Navy**: 15 war galleys committed\n- **Gold**: 50,000 dinars sent\n- **Motivation**: Religious obligation, restore prestige, strategic interest\n\n### Tunisia, Egypt, Ottomans\n- All provided gold and support to Granada\n- Watching situation closely\n- Granada's fight now represents broader Islamic resistance\n\n---\n\n## KEY UPCOMING EVENTS\n\n### September 1430\n- Juan travels Florence → Pisa → Barcelona → Seville\n- Granada's diplomatic mission departs for Seville\n- Moroccan troops arrive in Granada\n- Juan's health issues (malnutrition) will manifest\n- Intercepted correspondence issue may be discovered\n- Juan must navigate Barcelona (Alfonso V's territory)\n\n### October 1430\n- Juan arrives in Seville (late September/early October)\n- Juan encounters Granada's diplomatic mission\n- Preparation for Royal Council begins\n- Granada's forces continue assembling\n- Muslim volunteer warriors arriving\n- Intelligence about Granada's massive support becomes known\n\n### November 8, 1430\n- Royal Council convenes in Seville\n- Juan must present crusade bull publicly\n- Infantes will attend (must negotiate from weakness)\n- Major nobles, church hierarchy, city representatives present\n- Decision point: Does Castile unite for crusade or fracture further?\n\n---\n\n## MAJOR UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS\n\n1. **Will Juan's health crisis in Florence/Pisa delay his return?**\n\n2. **When/how will Juan discover his correspondence is being intercepted?**\n\n3. **How will Juan handle Granada's diplomatic mission?**\n   - Accept generous terms and delay crusade?\n   - Refuse and proceed with war?\n   - Negotiate different arrangement?\n\n4. **What happens when Juan appears in Barcelona?**\n   - Will Alfonso V grant audience?\n   - What intelligence gathering occurs?\n   - Any confrontations or diplomatic incidents?\n\n5. **Can Juan unite the fractious nobility at November council?**\n   - Will crusade bull overcome political divisions?\n   - Can he force Infantes to submit or fight them?\n   - Will neutral nobles commit to crusade?\n\n6. **How will Granada's unexpected strength affect Juan's plans?**\n   - Does he proceed with crusade knowing enemy is much stronger?\n   - Does this validate or undermine his divine certainty?\n   - Will his nobles still commit when they learn the true situation?\n\n7. **Will Pope Martin V survive long enough to support the crusade?**\n   - He's 72, in declining health\n   - If he dies, does new Pope maintain commitment?\n\n---\n\n## THEMATIC THREADS TO MAINTAIN\n\n- **Faith vs. Politics**: Juan's genuine piety mixed with calculated strategy\n- **Youth vs. Experience**: 18-year-old facing seasoned political operators\n- **Certainty vs. Humility**: Juan's conviction about divine favor vs. warnings about pride\n- **Legitimacy vs. Power**: Anointed authority vs. actual military/political control\n- **Religious War**: Crusade vs. Jihad - both sides claiming divine sanction\n- **The Cost of Leadership**: Physical, moral, and political toll on young king\n- **Building Loyalty**: Creating support network from nothing in hostile environment\n\n---\n\n*This document will be updated as the story progresses and new developments occur.*\n\nPerfect! I've created a comprehensive status document that captures:\n\nJuan's current position - location, resources, traveling party, and both personal challenges (malnutrition and intercepted letters)\n\nThe Infantes' situation - their failed revolt, current weakened position, and what they know from intercepted correspondence\n\nÁlvaro and the royal administration - how they successfully held the kingdom\n\nGranada's position - the failed mobilization, the CRITICAL SUCCESS with Muslim world support, and the diplomatic mission preparing to meet Juan\n\nAll the major political alignments, military forces, and foreign powers\n\nKey upcoming events and unresolved questions\n\nThis document serves as our \"game master's screen\" - I can reference it to maintain consistency, and you can see the current state of all the pieces on the board.\n\nReady to continue the narrative?\n\nWe left Juan in Rome on August 2, 1430, about to depart for Florence. We now know:\n\nHe'll develop malnutrition symptoms during the journey (bleeding gums, weakness)\n\nHis letters with Álvaro are being intercepted (he doesn't know this yet)\n\nGranada is preparing a major diplomatic mission to meet him\n\nThe Infantes are weakened but know more than they should\n\nShould we pick up the story with Juan's departure from Rome and journey to Florence, where both his health issues and the beautiful/dangerous world of Renaissance banking await him?"

          "text": "Juan is departing Rome for Florence. The journey is approximately 6-7 days by horse through central Italy. Let me assess the probability of reaching Florence quickly and without complications.\n\n## Factors Supporting Quick Journey:\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Well-established route (Via Cassia and other Roman roads, still maintained)\n- Summer/early August weather (generally good for travel)\n- Juan has experienced party with good horses\n- Motivated to return home quickly\n- Captain Fernán is competent at organizing travel\n- Italy is relatively peaceful in this region (no major wars)\n- They have adequate funds for lodging and supplies\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Juan's health is deteriorating (malnutrition developing - bleeding gums, weakness)\n- Four months of travel has worn down everyone and the horses\n- Italian summer heat can be intense\n- Some horses already lost/replaced on journey (Corporal Rodrigo's, Felipe's)\n- Party is tired from extended pilgrimage\n- Carrying valuable items (crusade bull, relics) requires caution\n- Need to maintain security while traveling quickly\n- Roads can still have bandits\n- Juan might push too hard given urgency\n\n## Historical Context:\n\nRome to Florence in 1430:\n- Distance: approximately 275-300 km (170-185 miles)\n- Normal travel time: 6-8 days on horseback with rest\n- Fast travel: 4-5 days if pushing hard\n- The roads are decent (former Roman roads, still usable)\n- Multiple cities/towns along route for lodging\n\n## Assessment:\n\nThis should be **LIKELY TO SUCCEED** because:\n- The route is well-established and relatively safe\n- They have resources and experienced leadership\n- Weather should be favorable\n- No major obstacles apparent\n\nHowever, it's not \"high probability\" because:\n- Juan's declining health could cause delays\n- The party is already worn from months of travel\n- Pushing for speed increases risk of accidents/problems\n- They need to balance speed with security (carrying precious items)\n\nI anticipate a challenging journey with multiple potential outcomes. The expedition will likely reach Florence within the expected timeframe, but Juan's deteriorating condition adds significant uncertainty. Potential scenarios range from a slightly delayed arrival to potential serious complications. The party must carefully balance speed with Juan's fragile health, managing risks while maintaining forward momentum. Their experienced leadership and resources provide some buffer against potential setbacks, but the journey remains precarious.\n\nProbability Assessment: Rome to Florence Journey\n\nThe Goal\n\nReach Florence as quickly as possible - ideally within 6-7 days of hard riding.\n\nThe Route\n\nDistance: ~275-300 km (170-185 miles) via Via Cassia and connecting roads\n\nTerrain: Through central Italy - rolling hills, some mountains, generally good roads\n\nNormal Travel Time: 6-8 days on horseback with proper rest\n\nFast Travel Time: 4-5 days if pushing hard\n\nFactors Supporting Success\n\nStrong Advantages:\n\nWell-established route (ancient Roman roads, still maintained)\n\nEarly August weather (generally favorable for travel)\n\nExperienced party with capable leadership (Captain Fernán, Sir Thomas)\n\nGood horses (recently replaced ones that went lame)\n\nAdequate funds for lodging, supplies, fresh horses if needed\n\nMotivated group (everyone wants to reach home)\n\nItaly relatively peaceful in this region\n\nMultiple towns along route for resupply\n\nFactors Working Against Success\n\nSignificant Concerns:\n\nJuan's health deteriorating (early malnutrition - bleeding gums, weakness, 4 months of travel toll)\n\nEntire party worn down from extended pilgrimage\n\nSummer heat in Italy can be intense\n\nCarrying extremely valuable items (crusade bull, sacred relics) - can't take excessive risks\n\nSecurity concerns require caution, which slows travel\n\nHorses also tired from long journey\n\nJuan's urgency might lead to pushing too hard (exhaustion, accidents)\n\nAlways risk of bandits on roads\n\nIf Juan's health fails during journey, major delays\n\nHistorical Context\n\nMedieval travel was unpredictable. Even established routes could have:\n\nWeather problems (sudden storms)\n\nLame horses\n\nIllness from bad food/water\n\nBandits in remote areas\n\nDelays at river crossings\n\nNeed to detour around local conflicts\n\nMy Assessment: LIKELY TO SUCCEED\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe fundamentals are solid - good route, experienced leadership, adequate resources, favorable season. Under normal circumstances, this would be \"High Probability of Success.\"\n\nHowever, Juan's declining health and the exhaustion from four months of travel create real vulnerability. The party isn't in peak condition. Pushing for maximum speed (which Juan will want to do) increases risk of accidents or health crisis.\n\nMost Likely Outcome: Reach Florence in 6-7 days as planned, but with Juan's malnutrition symptoms becoming undeniable during the journey. The fast pace and poor road food will exacerbate his condition.\n\nSuccess with Complications: They make it, but something goes wrong along the way (Juan falls ill, minor accident, delay that costs a day).\n\nIf you roll Failure: Significant delays (8-10 days), Juan's health crisis becomes acute, or some incident (bandit encounter, serious horse problem) forces slower pace.\n\nIf you roll Catastrophic Failure: Major crisis - Juan seriously ill and unable to travel, attack by bandits, severe accident, or combination forcing extended stay somewhere before Florence.\n\nIf you roll Great Success: Party makes excellent time (4-5 days), Juan's health holds together better than expected, no incidents, arrive Florence in good spirits.\n\nYour turn to roll!\n\nWhat result do you get for the journey from Rome to Florence?"

          "text": "Critical success on the journey to Florence! This is interesting because Juan has the malnutrition issue developing, but a critical success means the journey goes extraordinarily well. Let me think about how to handle this:\n\n1. They should make excellent time - maybe 4-5 days instead of 6-7\n2. The journey itself goes smoothly - no accidents, good weather, good roads\n3. BUT - Juan's health issue is ongoing and will manifest. A critical success on the journey doesn't cure his malnutrition\n4. Perhaps the critical success means:\n   - They make exceptional time\n   - No incidents or delays\n   - Juan's companions notice his declining health and take proactive action\n   - They arrive in Florence with time to spare AND with Juan's health issues identified early enough to address\n   - Maybe someone helps them along the way\n   - The journey bonds the group even more\n\nSo it's a critical success for the journey, but the health issue still exists and will need to be addressed in Florence. The success is that they arrive quickly, safely, and with Juan's condition not yet critical.\n\nLet me write this journey showing:\n- Excellent progress and speed\n- Growing camaraderie\n- Juan pushing hard but companions supporting\n- Early signs of health problems noticed\n- Beautiful Italian countryside\n- Arrival in Florence ahead of schedule and in good shape (relatively)\n\nThe Road to Florence - A Perfect Journey\n\nAugust 2-5, 1430: Rome to Florence\n\nDay One: The Dawn Departure (August 2)\n\nThe party left Rome at first light, the rising sun painting the ancient city in gold and rose. Juan II took one last look at St. Peter's dome as they rode north along the Via Cassia, the same road Roman legions had marched centuries before.\n\nThe air was cool and fresh in the early morning, before the August heat could settle. Captain Fernán set a brisk but sustainable pace, and the horses - well-rested from their days in Rome - moved eagerly.\n\n\"Your Majesty seems lighter,\" Fray Hernando observed as they rode. \"As if a weight has lifted.\"\n\nJuan nodded, his hand resting on the locked case containing the crusade bull that Sergeant García carried. \"I came to Rome seeking, Father. I leave with certainty. God has spoken through His Vicar. The path is clear.\"\n\nBy midday they'd covered twenty miles - excellent progress. They stopped at a roadside inn where the food was simple but fresh: bread still warm from the oven, cheese, olives, and surprisingly good wine. Juan ate eagerly, though he noticed his gums bled slightly when he bit into the bread. He said nothing.\n\nThat evening they reached Sutri, an ancient town carved into volcanic rock. The local priest, hearing a king traveled the road, offered them hospitality at the church. They slept in clean straw, guards rotating watch over the precious cargo.\n\nDistance: ~45 miles on day one\n\nDay Two: Into Tuscan Hills (August 3)\n\nThe Via Cassia led them through increasingly beautiful countryside. Rolling hills covered in vineyards and olive groves, cypresses standing sentinel along the roads, stone villages clinging to hilltops.\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont rode alongside Juan for several miles, sharing stories of his campaigns in France. \"You have the look of a commander now, Your Majesty. When we met in Santiago, you were a pilgrim. Now you carry yourself differently.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Purpose. Certainty. When men follow a leader into battle, they need to believe he knows where he's going. You have that now.\"\n\nAround noon, as they climbed a particularly steep hill, Juan's horse stumbled slightly. Without thinking, Juan corrected with perfect timing - seat, legs, hands all working in harmony. Captain Fernán, riding behind, smiled. The boy had become a horseman during these months.\n\nThey passed through Viterbo, a papal city of elegant buildings and bustling markets. The party stopped only briefly - fresh water, grain for horses, and they were off again.\n\nThat night at Montefiascone, perched high with views across the countryside, they found excellent lodging at a monastery. The monks provided a feast - roasted chicken, fresh vegetables from their garden, fruit preserves, good bread.\n\nJuan ate more than usual, suddenly ravenous. His companions noticed but said nothing, pleased to see him eating well after months of road rations.\n\nDistance: ~40 miles on day two. Total: 85 miles\n\nDay Three: The Perfect Rhythm (August 4)\n\nThe third day brought the party into their perfect rhythm. They'd traveled together for four months now, and every man knew his role without discussion.\n\nSergeant García and Corporal Rodrigo rode ahead as scouts, checking the road for problems. Martín and Felipe guarded the flanks. Captain Fernán commanded the center, with Juan, Fray Hernando, and Sir Thomas. Diego the secretary rode with Peter, Sir Thomas's squire, managing the pack animals.\n\nThe roads were excellent - well-maintained, clearly marked. They passed numerous travelers: merchants heading to Rome, pilgrims returning home, farmers with loaded carts. Everyone gave respectful room to the well-armed party carrying themselves with military discipline.\n\nAround midday, they encountered a merchant caravan that had lost a wheel. Without hesitation, Juan called a halt.\n\n\"We should help them,\" he said simply.\n\nCaptain Fernán looked at the sun, calculating lost time, but nodded. \"As Your Majesty commands.\"\n\nThe entire party dismounted and helped the merchants. It took only twenty minutes - strong arms lifting the cart, the wheel replaced, everything secured. The grateful merchant tried to offer payment.\n\nJuan smiled and shook his head. \"We serve God, friend. Help the next traveler you see in need.\"\n\nAs they rode on, Fray Hernando spoke quietly: \"That was well done, my lord. You could have passed them by. Kings often do.\"\n\n\"Kings who forget they're human,\" Juan replied.\n\nThey made camp that night near Lago di Bolsena, a vast crater lake of startling blue. The summer evening was warm and pleasant. The men built a fire, cooked fresh fish purchased from local fishermen, and shared wine as stars emerged.\n\nSergeant García produced a small lute he'd somehow acquired and played surprisingly well. Songs were sung - some Castilian, some French from Sir Thomas, even a bawdy Italian tavern song that Martín knew.\n\nJuan sat among his men, not above them. He laughed at the jokes, sang along poorly (he had no musical ear), and felt profoundly grateful for these companions.\n\nDistance: ~45 miles on day three. Total: 130 miles\n\nDay Four: The Notice (August 5)\n\nThey rose before dawn and were on the road as the sun broke the horizon. Florence was perhaps forty-five miles ahead - they could reach it today if they pushed.\n\nCaptain Fernán pulled alongside Juan. \"Your Majesty, may I speak frankly?\"\n\n\"Always.\"\n\n\"You're not eating enough. Your face is thinner than in Rome. I've seen soldiers develop scurvy on campaign - bleeding gums, weakness. You have the early signs.\"\n\nJuan was surprised. \"I hadn't realized you'd noticed.\"\n\n\"I've been watching. All of us have.\" Fernán gestured to include the whole party. \"You're pushing yourself hard - prayers, fasting, training. But you can't lead a crusade if you collapse from exhaustion.\"\n\nBefore Juan could respond, Fray Hernando rode up on the other side. \"The Captain is right. I've been meaning to speak with you about it. Your fasts have been too frequent, too severe. God gave you a body to use, not to destroy.\"\n\nJuan felt a flash of irritation - then caught himself. Pride. The very thing Fray Hernando kept warning about.\n\n\"What would you have me do?\"\n\n\"Eat properly. No more fasting until you're recovered. Real food, not just bread and dried meat. Rest when possible. You're eighteen, not invincible.\"\n\n\"Even if God protects me?\"\n\nCaptain Fernán's voice was gentle but firm: \"Even if God protects you, He expects you to use common sense. Martyrs die for the faith. Leaders stay alive to accomplish it.\"\n\nJuan was quiet for a moment, then nodded. \"You're both right. I've been... reckless with my health. Thinking faith excused carelessness.\"\n\n\"Not careless,\" Fray Hernando corrected. \"Zealous. But zeal without wisdom is dangerous.\"\n\nThat afternoon, they stopped at a well-appointed inn. Captain Fernán ordered a proper meal - roasted meat, vegetables, fresh bread, fruit. He stood over Juan like a mother hen until the king ate it all.\n\nJuan felt almost childish being managed this way. Then he realized: this was what loyal companions did. They told you uncomfortable truths.\n\nArrival in Florence (August 5, Late Afternoon)\n\nThe road descended from the hills, and suddenly the valley of the Arno opened before them. There, spread across both banks of the river, was Florence.\n\nEven from a distance, it was breathtaking. The massive dome of the cathedral - still under construction but already dominating the skyline - the towers of the Palazzo Vecchio, the Ponte Vecchio spanning the river, all bathed in golden afternoon light.\n\n\"Madonna,\" breathed Sir Thomas. \"I'd heard stories, but...\"\n\nThey entered through the Porta Romana, the southern gate. Guards examined them professionally but courteously. When Juan identified himself, the sergeant of the guard stared in surprise.\n\n\"The King of Castile? My lord, we had no word you were coming!\"\n\n\"I travel quietly. Can you direct us to appropriate lodging?\"\n\nWithin minutes, a city official appeared, flustered and excited. \"Your Majesty! The Signoria will want to know of your arrival! Let me arrange proper accommodation!\"\n\nBy evening, Juan's party was installed in a palazzo near the cathedral, guest of the Medici banking family. Servants brought hot water for bathing, clean linens, excellent food.\n\nCosimo de' Medici himself - the same merchant Juan had met on the road to Toulouse - arrived within the hour.\n\n\"Your Majesty! When we met on the road, I thought you were a young nobleman. Then I learned you were a king. And now my associates in Rome write that you met with the Holy Father himself!\" Cosimo's eyes sparkled with interest. \"You must dine with me tomorrow and tell me everything. Florence would be honored to support your endeavors.\"\n\nJuan, clean, fed, and resting in comfort for the first time in weeks, smiled. \"Signore Medici, I would be delighted.\"\n\nThe Success of the Journey\n\nTime: 4 days from Rome to Florence (versus planned 6-7) - exceptional speed\n\nCondition:\n\nNo accidents or incidents\n\nHorses in good shape\n\nAll equipment and cargo intact\n\nParty morale high\n\nBonds of companionship deepened\n\nJuan's Health:\n\nMalnutrition symptoms identified early by companions\n\nIntervention begun before crisis point\n\nTime in Florence will allow proper recovery\n\nSupport network functioning - Juan not alone in his struggles\n\nArrival Position:\n\nAhead of schedule (gives extra time before departure for Pisa/Barcelona)\n\nWelcomed by Florence's elite (Medici connections valuable)\n\nParty well-rested and in good spirits\n\nSacred relics and crusade bull completely secure\n\nNo enemies aware of exact location\n\nWhat Made It Critical Success:\n\nPerfect Conditions: Weather, roads, horses, timing all aligned\n\nExperienced Leadership: Captain Fernán's command kept them moving efficiently\n\nTeam Cohesion: Four months together created smooth operation\n\nJuan's Changed Leadership: Help given to merchants showed character, built morale\n\nEarly Health Intervention: Problem identified before becoming crisis\n\nDivine Favor?: Juan would certainly interpret the smooth journey as confirmation of God's blessing\n\nStatus: Evening of August 5, 1430\n\nLocation: Florence, installed in Medici palazzo\n\nPhysical Condition:\n\nJuan: Exhausted but stable; malnutrition identified; proper food and rest beginning\n\nParty: In good shape, morale high\n\nTime Gained: 2-3 extra days in Florence before needing to depart for Pisa\n\nOpportunities in Florence:\n\nMeet with banking families (potential crusade financing)\n\nRest and recover properly\n\nBuild relationships with Italian merchant princes\n\nPerhaps acquire additional supplies or contacts\n\nAddress health issues before they become serious\n\nNext Steps:\n\nDinner with Cosimo de' Medici tomorrow\n\nRecovery and proper nutrition for Juan\n\nArrange financing/support for crusade\n\nPrepare for next leg (Florence → Pisa → Barcelona)\n\nThe critical success transformed what could have been an exhausting, problematic journey into a perfect transit. Juan arrives in Florence not as a desperate pilgrim but as a blessed king, ahead of schedule, with his support network functioning beautifully, and with time to address problems before they become crises.\n\nReady to explore Florence and Juan's interactions with the Medici banking family?"

          "text": "1. Set the scene - this would be the dinner the next evening (August 6)\n2. Portray Cosimo accurately - he's intelligent, sophisticated, politically astute, interested in power and profit but also genuinely cultured\n3. Let the conversation flow naturally based on what Juan says\n4. Cosimo knows Juan met the Pope and got something significant\n5. Cosimo is interested in both the political/financial opportunities and genuinely curious about this young king\n6. I should stop when it's natural for Juan to respond, keeping it conversational\n7. Not write Juan's dialogue unless the user gives general direction\n\nLet me set the scene and have Cosimo initiate, then see what Juan wants to discuss.\n\nDinner at the Medici Palazzo - August 6, 1430\n\nThe Setting\n\nThe evening is warm and pleasant. You've been shown to a private dining room in the Medici palazzo - not the grand formal hall, but an intimate chamber with windows overlooking an interior garden. The room is elegant but not ostentatious: fine tapestries, carved furniture, candlelight reflecting off polished wood.\n\nCosimo de' Medici rises from his seat as you enter. He's about 40 years old, dressed in rich but understated merchant's clothing - deep burgundy velvet, gold chain of office. His face is intelligent and watchful, with the slightest suggestion of a knowing smile.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says with a bow that's respectful but not servile. \"Welcome. I took the liberty of arranging a private dinner - I thought you might prefer conversation without half of Florence watching.\"\n\nHe gestures to the table, already set with wine, bread, olives, and various Tuscan delicacies. \"Please, sit. My servants will bring the meal shortly, but I wanted a few moments to speak freely first.\"\n\nAs you settle into your seat, Cosimo pours wine for you himself - a gesture of respect and informality. He sits across from you, studying you with open curiosity.\n\n\"When we met on the road to Toulouse,\" he begins, \"I thought you were a young nobleman on pilgrimage. Devout, intelligent, but... one of many. Then my correspondents in Rome send letters that have the entire city talking.\"\n\nHe leans forward slightly, his eyes bright with interest.\n\n\"They say you met privately with Pope Martin V. That something extraordinary occurred. That His Holiness was moved to tears - and the old man hasn't wept in public in twenty years.\" A pause. \"They say you have obtained a crusade bull for Granada.\"\n\nHe sips his wine, watching your reaction.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I am a banker and a merchant. My business is knowing what happens in the world before others do, and understanding what it means. So I must ask directly: What brings the young King of Castile to Florence? And how can the house of Medici be of service?\"\n\nHis tone is respectful but frank - treating you as an equal in negotiation rather than a superior to be flattered.\n\nHe waits for your response."

And I am here to gather support for this cause. I would like to have a dinner with you, but I don't mind if the other nobles of Florance are also present. I want to give everyone to express their support.\n\n\nI also want to adress the good christians of Florance as soon as possible. A public speech where I can also put my relics on display. I have no banner yet unfortunately. Do you have suggestions for locations and time?"

          "text": "Juan is being very direct and bold here. He's:\n1. Confirming the crusade bull openly\n2. Requesting a larger dinner with Florence's elite\n3. Wanting to give a public speech to the common people\n4. Wanting to display the sacred relics publicly\n5. Asking Cosimo for advice on logistics\n\nThis is interesting - Juan is using Florence as a staging ground to build momentum and support before returning to Castile. He's also being remarkably open with Cosimo, treating him as an ally/partner rather than just a banker.\n\nCosimo would be:\n- Impressed by Juan's directness and confidence\n- Calculating the political/financial opportunities\n- Slightly concerned about the boldness (public displays draw attention)\n- Interested in being associated with a papal crusade (prestige)\n- Thinking about how this affects Florence's interests\n\nLet me have Cosimo respond thoughtfully, mixing enthusiasm with practical concerns, and offering concrete suggestions.\n\nCosimo's Response\n\nCosimo's eyebrows rise slightly, and a genuine smile spreads across his face. He sets down his wine cup and leans back, regarding you with what looks like a mixture of admiration and assessment.\n\n\"Your Majesty, you do not conduct yourself like most young kings I've met.\" There's approval in his voice. \"Most would dance around the topic, hint at their purpose, play political games. You speak plainly. I appreciate that.\"\n\nHe stands and walks to the window, looking out over the garden, thinking. Then he turns back to you.\n\n\"Let me be equally plain. What you propose is ambitious - and brilliant. Florence is the perfect place for this. We are bankers to half of Europe, merchants to the other half. Word of what happens here spreads quickly. If the King of Castile displays sacred relics and calls for crusade in Florence, every court from London to Constantinople will hear of it within a month.\"\n\nHe begins ticking off points on his fingers, the merchant's mind working:\n\n\"A dinner with Florence's elite - yes, absolutely. I can arrange that for tomorrow evening if you wish, or the day after if you need more rest. The Signoria will want to attend - our governing council. The heads of the major banking families: the Strozzi, the Pazzi, the Albizzi, the Tornabuoni. Representatives of the major guilds. Perhaps twenty to thirty of the most influential men in Florence. They will be honored, and they will talk about it for years.\"\n\nHe pauses, his expression becoming more serious.\n\n\"The public speech and display of relics - this is powerful but also...\" he chooses his words carefully, \"...bold. It will draw enormous attention. The entire city will turn out. But Your Majesty, I must ask: are you certain you want to announce your crusade so publicly before you've even returned to Castile?\"\n\nHe holds up a hand quickly. \"I'm not counseling against it - but consider: the Infantes de Aragón surely have agents in Florence. Muslim merchants trade here regularly. Word will reach Granada quickly. And King Alfonso of Aragon - your cousin - has deep connections with Italian city-states.\"\n\nHe walks closer, speaking more quietly.\n\n\"If you display those relics and proclaim your crusade here, you lose the element of surprise. Your enemies will know exactly what's coming and have months to prepare. On the other hand...\" and here his smile returns, \"you gain something perhaps more valuable: momentum. Religious fervor. The sense that this crusade is inevitable, blessed, unstoppable. Men respond to that.\"\n\nHe returns to his seat.\n\n\"So I will help you with whatever you decide. But let me lay out the practical considerations:\n\nFor the Elite Dinner:\n\nI can host at my palazzo or arrange the Palazzo Vecchio if you prefer the Signoria's official venue\n\nTomorrow evening or the next day\n\nTwenty to thirty guests, all carefully chosen\n\nOpportunity to discuss financial support, supplies, military expertise\n\nFor the Public Speech:\n\nThe Piazza della Signoria is the obvious location - heart of the city, can hold thousands\n\nOr the cathedral steps - more religious setting, equally impressive\n\nWe'd need two days to prepare properly - spread word, ensure security, build a platform\n\nDisplay the relics in the cathedral afterward for pilgrims to venerate\n\nRegarding the banner:\n\nFlorence has the finest craftsmen in Italy\n\nIf you describe what you want, I can have it made within three days\n\nWhite banner with the cross? The relics mounted on it? Your father's sword displayed?\n\nMy recommendation:\n\nTomorrow evening: Private dinner with Florence's elite - build financial and political support\n\nDay after tomorrow: Public proclamation in Piazza della Signoria - religious spectacle\n\nUse the intervening time to commission your banner, rest, prepare your speech\"\n\nHe refills both wine cups and raises his.\n\n\"But Your Majesty, these are merely suggestions. You are the crusader king. What would you prefer?\"\n\nHis expression is open, engaged, clearly excited by the prospect but also waiting to hear your vision for how this should unfold.\n\nWhat do you say to Cosimo? And what are your priorities - the elite support, the public spectacle, or something else?"

I hope they can make me something beautiful.\n\n\nCan we schedule the public speech in three days? The banner should be ready by then and also the podium should be ready by then.

Banner to be created - all white, no symbols, but artisans can use shape/texture to make it beautiful\n3. Public speech in 3 days in Piazza della Signoria\n\nThis is reasonable timing. Cosimo is a capable administrator and Florence has excellent craftsmen. The white banner request is interesting - it reflects Juan's commitment to the symbolism from Rome (white garments bearing honest stains).\n\nCosimo would likely be able to do this, but might have some practical questions or suggestions. He'd want to clarify details and make sure everything is perfect.\n\nLet me have Cosimo respond with enthusiasm but also some practical follow-up questions.\n\nCosimo's Response\n\nCosimo's face lights up with genuine enthusiasm. He strikes the table lightly with his palm.\n\n\"Three days - yes, absolutely this can be done. Florence did not become the greatest city in Italy by moving slowly when opportunity presents itself.\"\n\nHe immediately pulls out a small notebook and stylus from his sleeve - the merchant's habit of recording everything - and begins making notes as he speaks.\n\n\"Tomorrow evening then - the dinner. I will host here at my palazzo. Intimate, refined, but with all the important men present. They will be falling over themselves for an invitation once word spreads that the King of Castile dines with the Medici.\"\n\nHe pauses, a slight smile playing at his lips. \"Your Majesty, you may not realize it, but by choosing my house for this dinner, you've just elevated my family's standing considerably. The other banking families will notice. I am... grateful.\"\n\nThen he turns to the practical matters, his tone becoming more focused:\n\n\"The banner - all white, no symbols or insignia, but with texture and shape to make it beautiful. This is unusual. Normally a battle standard carries heraldry, coats of arms...\" He catches himself. \"But I think I understand. The purity of the white itself is the symbol. Very well.\"\n\nHe makes more notes.\n\n\"I will send for Master Filippo Brunelleschi - he's the architect designing our cathedral dome, but he also understands fabric, form, and beauty better than anyone. And the Silk Guild has the finest weavers in Christendom. Between them, they will create something extraordinary. A banner that is pure white but catches the light, has depth, moves beautifully in wind...\"\n\nHe looks up at you. \"How large should it be? Large enough to be seen across the piazza? Large enough to carry into battle? And will you want a pole or staff for it - perhaps your father's sword could be mounted as the staff?\"\n\nBefore you can answer, he continues:\n\n\"Three days for the public speech - the Piazza della Signoria. Perfect. That gives us time to:\n\nSpread word throughout the city and countryside\n\nBuild a proper platform so you can be seen and heard\n\nArrange security - when thousands gather, we need order\n\nPrepare the cathedral to receive the relics afterward for veneration\n\nEnsure the city's best musicians and the bishop are present\n\nPerhaps arrange for the guild standards to be displayed as well?\"\n\nHe taps his stylus against the notebook thoughtfully.\n\n\"A few questions, Your Majesty, so I can prepare everything perfectly:\n\nAbout the speech itself:\n\nWill you want to speak in Latin, Italian, or Castilian? I can arrange translators if needed.\n\nShould the papal bull be read aloud, or will you summarize its contents?\n\nWill you display the relics during the speech, or process with them afterward?\n\nDo you wish to take the crusader's vow publicly, or have already done so in Rome?\n\nAbout the attendees:\n\nThe Bishop of Florence should formally receive you and bless the gathering - shall I arrange that?\n\nDo you want only Florentines, or should word go out to nearby cities? We could have five thousand or fifteen thousand depending on how widely we spread news.\n\nAbout security:\n\nYou mentioned enemies might be watching. Shall we have your guards visible around you, or keep them concealed in the crowd?\n\nThe crusade bull and relics - these are priceless. Extra precautions during the public display?\n\nAnd one delicate matter:\n\nAfter the speech, there will be enthusiasm. Young men will want to take the cross and join your crusade. Should we be prepared to formally enroll volunteers? Or is this purely proclamation without immediate recruitment?\"\n\nHe sets down his stylus and looks at you directly.\n\n\"Your Majesty, you are turning Florence into a stage for Christendom. Everything that happens here will be reported across Europe. The Muslim world will hear of it. Your enemies will analyze every detail. Your supporters will be inspired.\"\n\nA slight pause, then more quietly:\n\n\"This is brilliant strategy - or magnificent risk. Perhaps both. But I want to make sure we execute it flawlessly. So tell me: what is most important to you in these three days? What must go perfectly?\"\n\nHe waits for your guidance, clearly ready to mobilize the considerable resources of Florence's most powerful banking family to make your vision reality.\n\nWhat are your priorities? What details matter most to you?"

My staff will give the craftsmen access under supervision so the artists can find out how the relics can be securely fastened.\n\n\nTHere is room on the platform for the guilds for example or others. But I will presume their support for my cause, more than just empty words.\n\n\nI speak a bit Italian so I will prepare my speech and speak in Italian. Just don't ask me to improvide too much. I will determine the speech myself but I will summarize the bull.\n\n\nAll christians are welcome. I will travel on to Pisa. I know that there are tentions between your cities, but this concerns all of christendom, not just Florance.\n\n\nThose that want to join the crusade can travel to Sevilla by themselves or in groups. There the crusade will start in earnest and I can really accept men into the service of the crusade.\n\n\nWhat matters most? Just make sure the platform and the standard are ready in time.

          "text": "This is great - Juan is being decisive and clear about his priorities. He's:\n1. Keeping his father's sword (practical and symbolic)\n2. Planning to fasten the relics to the banner during the speech (dramatic, public commitment)\n3. Setting expectations for guild support (not just attendance)\n4. Speaking in Italian (showing respect, also vulnerability - he admits he's not fluent)\n5. Inviting all Christians, including from Pisa (diplomatic, even though Florence-Pisa tensions exist)\n6. Directing volunteers to Seville (practical - can't recruit here directly)\n7. Trusting God for the rest (faith and pragmatism balanced)\n\nCosimo should respond positively to this clarity and decisiveness. He's a practical man who appreciates someone who knows what they want. Juan is showing leadership here - making clear decisions, acknowledging limitations (Italian skills), being inclusive, and keeping focus on what truly matters.\n\nI should have Cosimo:\n- Express approval of the clear direction\n- Commit to delivering on the platform and banner\n- Perhaps gently offer help with the Italian speech (tutoring/practice)\n- Note the political wisdom of including Pisa\n- Maybe mention one concern about the public relics-fastening (security/practicality)\n- But ultimately defer to Juan's judgment\n- Seal the arrangement\n\nThen we can move to what happens next - probably the dinner tomorrow, unless Juan wants to do something else in the meantime.\n\nCosimo's Commitment\n\nCosimo stands and bows, a gesture of genuine respect rather than mere formality.\n\n\"Your Majesty, you have the clarity of vision that most men twice your age lack. You know what matters and what does not. This... this I can work with.\"\n\nHe makes final notes in his book, speaking as he writes:\n\n\"Your father's sword remains with you - of course, a king should never be unarmed. The banner will be designed to receive the relics during your speech - the craftsmen will coordinate with your guards to ensure secure fastening. The platform and standard will be ready. Everything else, as you say, is in God's hands.\"\n\nHe looks up with a slight smile.\n\n\"Inviting Pisa as well - you are wiser than you know, Your Majesty. Florence and Pisa have... tensions. But you rise above our petty rivalries and speak to all Christendom. That will be noticed and appreciated.\" He pauses. \"It also means word spreads even faster. By the time you reach Barcelona, half the Mediterranean will have heard of your speech in Florence.\"\n\nThen he adds, more gently:\n\n\"Your Italian is good, but if you wish, I can arrange for someone to help you practice your speech over the next two days. Not to write it for you - that must come from your heart - but to ensure pronunciation is clear, that the Florentine crowd can understand every word. You want them to hear your passion, not struggle with your accent.\"\n\nHe sets his notebook aside and refills both wine cups.\n\n\"So it is settled. Tomorrow evening - dinner with Florence's elite. Then two days of preparation. Then the public proclamation in the Piazza della Signoria with the banner ready and the relics to be fastened before all eyes.\"\n\nHe raises his cup.\n\n\"Your Majesty, when you arrived in Florence yesterday, you were a young king passing through. When you leave in a week, you will be the crusader who set Italy ablaze with holy purpose. The Medici are honored to play a small part in this.\"\n\nHe drinks, then his expression becomes more serious.\n\n\"Now, with business settled, may I ask a more personal question? You have been traveling for four months. You obtained the Pope's blessing - an extraordinary achievement. You carry the weight of a kingdom and now a crusade on your shoulders. And you are eighteen years old.\"\n\nHe leans forward slightly.\n\n\"How are you, truly? Captain Fernán mentioned this morning that you've been pushing yourself hard. That you need rest and proper food. You have two days before the speech. Will you allow yourself to rest? Or will you spend every moment preparing?\"\n\nHis tone is not judgmental but genuinely concerned - perhaps almost fatherly.\n\n\"Kings often forget they are mortal. I would not want to see you collapse on that platform before thousands of witnesses.\"\n\nHe waits for your response, clearly willing to push further on this point if needed.\n\nThe evening continues. You can respond to Cosimo's concern, ask him questions, or steer the conversation in any direction. The servants are beginning to bring the first course of the meal - roasted quail with herbs, fresh vegetables, Tuscan bread.\n\nWhat do you say or do?"

The crowd roars back the phrase. He publicly attaches the True Cross fragment and Saint James bone to the all-white banner. The event becomes legendary: Florentine merchants pledge 15,000 florins, 200 volunteers sign up including 50 professional soldiers, the Bishop of Florence endorses the crusade publicly, and word begins spreading across Europe that a young king has risen to complete the Reconquista.",

          "text": "The Piazza della Signoria is Florence's main square - large, impressive, with the Palazzo Vecchio (the town hall with its tower). In 1430, the cathedral dome is under construction (Brunelleschi's famous dome).\n\nThis is August 9, 1430 - late morning or early afternoon for best visibility and crowds.\n\nThe Piazza della Signoria - August 9, 1430, Late Morning\n\nBefore You Step Forward\n\nYou stand in the shadows of the Palazzo Vecchio's loggia, looking out at what Cosimo and Florence have created in just three days.\n\nThe Crowd\n\nThe scale is staggering. The Piazza della Signoria is packed with humanity - perhaps eight to ten thousand people filling every available space. They spill out of the square into the surrounding streets. Some have climbed onto fountains, others onto the bases of statues. Windows of surrounding buildings are crowded with faces.\n\nThe composition is varied:\n\nFlorentine merchants in their fine woolens and velvets, guild chains gleaming\n\nCommon workers in rougher cloth - dyers with stained hands, leather workers, masons\n\nFarmers from the countryside in simple tunics, having walked hours to be here\n\nMonks and friars in their habits - Franciscan brown, Dominican black and white\n\nForeign merchants - you spot turbans (Muslim traders), different styles of dress\n\nChildren perched on fathers' shoulders\n\nOld women clutching rosaries\n\nYoung men with eager, hungry expressions\n\nThe noise: A constant rumble of thousands of conversations, anticipation building like thunder before a storm. Every few minutes, the crowd surges slightly as more people push in from the edges.\n\nThe Platform\n\nBuilt against the steps of the Palazzo Vecchio, it rises about eight feet above the crowd - high enough to be seen from across the piazza.\n\nConstruction: Solid timber, draped with white cloth that matches your banner. Steps lead up from behind. A simple wooden lectern stands at the center where you'll speak.\n\nAlready on the platform:\n\nThe Bishop of Florence in full vestments, his miter catching the sunlight\n\nCosimo de' Medici and three other prominent Florentines, dressed formally\n\nSpaces left open for you and your immediate companions\n\nYour Banner\n\nIt takes your breath away.\n\nMaster Brunelleschi and the silk weavers have created something extraordinary. The banner is massive - twelve feet tall, eight feet wide when fully unfurled - made of the finest white silk Florence can produce.\n\nThe artistry: Though entirely white as you requested, it's anything but plain:\n\nMultiple layers of silk in different weaves catch the light differently\n\nSubtle quilted patterns create depth and texture\n\nThe edges are finished with intricate white embroidery - vine patterns that suggest growth, life\n\nWhen it moves in the breeze, it seems almost alive, rippling like water\n\nIn the August sunlight, it practically glows\n\nThe reliquaries: Two mounting points have been expertly crafted into the banner's design - one high, one low - ready to receive the True Cross fragment and Saint James's bone during your speech. The gold and silver reliquaries will stand out brilliantly against the white.\n\nThe banner is currently furled, held by two of Cosimo's strongest servants. When unfurled at the right moment, it will be spectacular.\n\nYour Companions\n\nStanding with you in the loggia's shadow:\n\nCaptain Fernán Alonso de Robles: In his best armor, polished until it gleams. His hand rests on his sword hilt. His eyes constantly scan the crowd - the professional soldier assessing threats. He catches your glance and nods once. Steady. Ready.\n\nFray Hernando de Talavera: In his simple Hieronymite habit, looking both awed and troubled. He's praying quietly, lips moving. When he notices you watching, he whispers: \"May God grant you the right words. And may you remember: this power you wield is His, not yours.\"\n\nSergeant García: Holding the locked case with the crusade bull. His expression is fierce pride. This peasant soldier is about to stand on a platform before thousands while his king proclaims holy war.\n\nCorporal Rodrigo: Holding the two reliquaries, wrapped in white silk. His hands are steady but you can see the tension in his shoulders. These are the most sacred objects he'll ever touch.\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont: The English knight looks impressed despite himself. \"I've seen kings address armies before battle. Never seen one address an entire city like this. This is... something else.\"\n\nDiego, your secretary: Nervously clutching the written text of your speech - your notes and the key phrases you've practiced. He'll stand nearby in case you need them, though you've memorized most of it.\n\nThe Details You Notice\n\nThe security: Florentine guards line the edges of the platform and create corridors through the crowd. Your own guards (Martín and Felipe) are positioned at the platform's base, hands near weapons but trying not to look threatening. There are perhaps fifty armed men managing this crowd - necessary, but also vulnerable if things go wrong.\n\nThe watchers: Your eye catches certain figures in the crowd who don't quite fit:\n\nA well-dressed man near the back who seems to be taking notes\n\nA small group of Muslim merchants watching with very careful, neutral expressions\n\nSomeone in nondescript clothing who's positioned where they can see everything but aren't participating in the excitement - agent of some kind?\n\nYour enemies are here, watching. The Infantes' spies. Perhaps Granada's agents. Definitely Alfonso V's informants. Everything you say and do will be reported.\n\nThe guild banners: As you requested, the major guilds have brought their standards - the wool guild, the silk guild, the bankers, the stone masons. Twelve great banners line the edges of the platform, creating a framework of civic pride around your religious message. Clever - it makes this a Florentine event as much as a crusading proclamation.\n\nThe cathedral bells: As you watch, the bells of the cathedral begin to ring - not the full peal, but a steady, solemn tolling that quiets the crowd slightly. The signal. Time is near.\n\nYour father's sword: Hangs at your side, the inscription visible to those close enough to read: Non Nobis Domine. Not unto us, O Lord.\n\nThe Physical Sensation\n\nYour heart is pounding. Not from fear exactly, but from the sheer magnitude of what's about to happen. In a few moments, you'll step onto that platform. Ten thousand people will fall silent. You'll speak words that will echo across Europe. You'll fasten sacred relics to your banner before all their eyes. You'll proclaim crusade.\n\nYour health: The two days of rest helped. Cosimo ensured you ate proper meals - fresh fruit, vegetables, good meat, Tuscan bread with olive oil. Your gums still bleed slightly when you eat, but you're stronger than you were on the road. Not fully recovered, but functional. You can do this.\n\nYour state of mind:\n\nCertainty about your purpose (perhaps too much certainty, Fray Hernando would say)\n\nAwareness that this is the point of no return - once you proclaim this publicly, there's no going back\n\nPride (you try to suppress it, but it's there - you're about to do something extraordinary)\n\nFaith (genuine, despite the political calculation)\n\nNervous energy (you're eighteen, about to address ten thousand people)\n\nCosimo Approaches\n\nThe Florentine banker materializes at your elbow. He's been managing every detail for three days and looks both exhausted and exhilarated.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says quietly, \"the city is ready. The bishop is ready. The banner is ready. And most importantly...\" he meets your eyes, \"you are ready. I've seen how you've prepared. You know what to say.\"\n\nHe glances at the crowd. \"They came expecting a spectacle. Give them something more. Give them a vision. Make them see Granada falling to the Cross. Make them feel that this is God's will made manifest. Make them believe that supporting you is supporting Christ Himself.\"\n\nA pause, then more gently: \"And remember to breathe. Speak slowly. Let your words carry. You have a young voice - it will crack if you shout. Use the acoustics of the square. Be yourself.\"\n\nHe steps back and gestures toward the platform.\n\n\"Whenever you're ready, Your Majesty. Florence awaits.\"\n\nThe Moment\n\nThe cathedral bells stop their tolling. The crowd noise is beginning to drop as people realize something is about to happen. The Bishop of Florence has moved to the center of the platform and raised his arms - a signal for silence.\n\nThe rumble of ten thousand conversations dies to a murmur, then to near-silence. Only the sounds of the city remain - distant horses, a baby crying somewhere, birds, the wind in the banners.\n\nCaptain Fernán looks at you. \"Your Majesty?\"\n\nFray Hernando makes the sign of the cross over you. \"Go with God.\"\n\nSergeant García and Corporal Rodrigo fall in behind you, carrying the crusade bull and the reliquaries.\n\nThe servants holding your furled banner take their positions.\n\nThis is it. This is the moment your entire journey has built toward. Santiago, France, Rome, the papal audience, the crusade bull - all of it led to this square, this platform, this crowd.\n\nWhat do you do? Do you step forward immediately? Do you say anything to your companions first? Do you pause for a moment of prayer? How do you want to approach the platform?"

          "text": "I will now perform an action, trying to gain support for my cause. Without drafting a response, first describe what chance of success my speech will have.\n\n\nI walk on to the platform and adress the gathered crowd in a loud voice in my practiced Italian.\n\n\nCitizens of Florance, christians everywhere. I greet you and bid you welcome here today. \nChristians...I sometimes wonder what it means to be a christian. What it means to be a true or good christian more specifically. Am I a good Christian? I try to be. But will I ever be sure? What holy task is there that can confirm our christianity? Sometimes I wish there was something that I could do, like chopping a big pile of wood, that would make me a good christian if only I chopped everything. Unfortunately, such concrete opportunities only seldom present themselves.\n\n\nI take a moment and walk to my banner and touch it for a moment before turning back to the crowd.\n\n\nSeldom and rare they are, these opportunities. And dont get me wrong, chopping wood can indeed serve the lord, especially if it warms not only you but also your family. God's grace exists in a father feeding his family, or a mother caring for her children.\n\n\nI chuckle as I think of these tender moments and see a glimpse of God's kingdom before me in a fleeting moment.\n\n\nI have been blessed, my friends. Blessed by our holy father the pope, not because he held my head in his hands and spoke his blessing. No! He blessed me because he gave me a task so concrete, so tangible, so clear that will cement my christianity forever if I only complete it. I have offered him my service and he has set me to task.\n\n\nI turn to the crowd and hold out my arms wide.\n\n\nAnd he offers you the same chance as well!\n\n\nI pause for a moment before continuing.\n\n\nIn a few months time, at 8 November, I will convene my council in Sevilla where I will officially start my crusade to bring christendom to Grenada. The holy father has been so very clear in his demands. Take all cities, convert all mosques to churches, letting all muslims live peacefully under christian rule, and finally, we only have to celebrate a te Deum in the Cathedral of Grenada! Meet me in Sevilla in November, and I will accept you personally as crusader. We will together with every noble soldier of christendom accomplish this holy task.\n\n\nBut our task is great, full of danger and will test our resolve greatly. But fortunately, we have support from God himself. We will rally under his banner.\n\n\nI signal for the banner to be unfurled.\n\n\nWe carry with us some of the most sacred relics in christendom. We march with a piece of the cross of christ himself and a bone from saint Santiago. Bear witness!\n\n\nI signal for the relics to be brought and attached to the banner.\n\n\nAnd my fellow christians, the papal bull gives many advantages to those supporting the crusade. Some may support the cause by giving shelter to travelling crusaders, others provide their service, their food or their lands.\n\n\nThose who seek the most spiritual rewards may even join the crusade itself, but I must warn those who contemplate this. Being a soldier in christ's army is not without responsibilities and duties. All who join must serve. But all who join will recieve their crusader's clasp from me personally. This small trinket is property of the church and may never be sold or given away. It is a sign of your personal vow not to rest until the crusade is complete. And when the moment finally is there when we celebrate the Te Deum together, I will hold all of our oaths fulfilled and will reward every crusader not only spiritually, but worldly as well. Those who join the crusade will share in it's success and glory!\n\n\nWhat does it mean to be a christian? It is someone who is merciful, so we shall be merciful against the Moors when mercy is required. A christian is generous. So we shall be generous when needed. But a christian has resolve above all else, is fearless in the face of danger, brave, courageous. We are the soldiers of Christ!\n\n\nI draw my sword and point it high towards the heavens.\n\n\nNon Nobis Domine!"

          "text": "**What Juan is attempting:**\n- Rally support for his crusade from a crowd of 8,000-10,000 people in Florence\n- Create religious fervor and enthusiasm\n- Recruit potential crusaders\n- Build momentum for the crusade announcement\n- Make a dramatic, memorable impression that will spread across Europe\n\n**Factors Supporting Success:**\n\n**Very Strong Advantages:**\n- Papal backing (crusade bull) - enormous legitimacy\n- Sacred relics being displayed - incredibly powerful in medieval context\n- Perfect staging (platform, banner, crowd management)\n- Speech structure is good - personal, relatable opening, building to climax\n- The banner unfurling and relic attachment is brilliant theater\n- Appeals to both spiritual and material motivations\n- Speaking Italian (shows respect, though his accent might be noticeable)\n- Concrete call to action (November 8 in Seville)\n- The sword moment at the end - dramatic and memorable\n- Florence is wealthy, influential, word will spread\n- Crowd is primed and ready - three days of anticipation\n- Religious fervor of the era - crusades are still prestigious\n- Youth and sincerity - Juan comes across as genuine\n\n**Supporting Elements:**\n- Two days of rest improved his health\n- He's practiced his Italian\n- The theatrical elements (banner, relics) are perfectly timed\n- Cosimo's support ensures everything runs smoothly\n- The crowd composition includes both elite and common people\n- Religious sentiment is strong in 1430\n\n**Factors Working Against Success:**\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n- Juan is 18, inexperienced at public speaking\n- Speaking in Italian (not his native language) - could stumble\n- His health is still not perfect (early scurvy symptoms)\n- The crowd is huge - maintaining control is challenging\n- Some in the crowd are spies/enemies who will report critically\n- Muslim merchants present might be offended/concerned\n\n- Florentines' practical concerns could undermine enthusiasm\n\nI see significant challenges in Juan's pitch. The Florentine audience is pragmatic, more interested in commerce than distant military campaigns. His speech lacks precision, with meandering metaphors that might confuse listeners. The distant nature of Granada and the long-term commitment required could dampen the crowd's initial excitement. Despite carefully crafted theatrical elements, Juan must overcome deep-seated local indifference and competing priorities to succeed.\n\nThe papal endorsement and sacred relics provide powerful symbolic weight, potentially bridging the motivational gap. His youth and sincerity offer an emotional counterpoint to the strategic hesitation. While not guaranteed, the fundamental elements of spectacle and spiritual appeal create a compelling narrative that might just persuade the skeptical Florentine crowd.\n\nSuccess hinges on generating enthusiasm: volunteers committing, financial backing emerging, European momentum building. Yet subtle risks remain - Juan's inexperience, linguistic challenges, and the inherent complexity of rallying support for a distant crusade.\n\nProbability Assessment: The Speech in Florence\n\nWhat You're Attempting\n\nRally support for the Granada crusade from 8,000-10,000 people in Florence's main square, creating religious fervor and momentum that will spread across Europe.\n\nFactors Supporting Success\n\nVery Strong Advantages:\n\nPapal backing - You have a genuine crusade bull from Pope Martin V, who was personally moved by you. This is extraordinary legitimacy\n\nSacred relics - A fragment of the True Cross and Saint James's bone. In 1430, this is incredibly powerful. People will travel for days just to see these\n\nPerfect theatrical staging - The banner, the platform, the timing, the crowd management. Cosimo has orchestrated this brilliantly\n\nYouth and sincerity - You come across as genuinely devoted, not a cynical politician. Your age makes you compelling\n\nThe spectacle - Banner unfurling, relics being attached in front of thousands. This is memorable theater\n\nClear call to action - November 8 in Seville. Specific, concrete, achievable\n\nAppeals to multiple motivations - Spiritual rewards, worldly rewards, adventure, glory, religious duty\n\nHistorical moment - This will be talked about for years. Everyone present will remember they were there\n\nSupporting Elements:\n\nYou've rested and recovered somewhat\n\nYou practiced your Italian\n\nThe crowd is primed and eager\n\nReligious fervor is strong in this era\n\nYour sword moment is dramatic\n\nThe papal bull addresses practical concerns (indulgences, protections)\n\nFactors Working Against Success\n\nChallenges:\n\nLanguage barrier - You're speaking Italian, not your native Castilian. Your accent will be noticeable. Some phrases might be awkward\n\nYouth and inexperience - You're 18, addressing 10,000 people. Your voice might crack. You might rush or stumble\n\nHealth - You're not fully recovered. Early scurvy symptoms could affect your stamina\n\nSpeech content - The wood-chopping metaphor is a bit odd. Some parts ramble. Not as polished as a professional orator\n\nDistance and relevance - Granada is far from Florence. Florentines are bankers and merchants, not warriors. Why should they care?\n\nEnemies present - Spies are watching. Muslim merchants are offended. Critics will report unfavorably\n\nAsking for commitment months away - You're not recruiting today, you're asking them to come to Seville in November. Will enthusiasm survive that long?\n\nCrowd control - 10,000 people is hard to manage. Things could go wrong\n\nHistorical Context\n\nCrusading enthusiasm in 1430s is lower than in previous centuries\n\nBut papal backing still carries enormous weight in this era\n\nSacred relics are objects of profound veneration\n\nYoung, sincere kings are appealing figures\n\nFlorence loves spectacle and will remember this\n\nWord from Florence spreads quickly across Europe\n\nMy Assessment: LIKELY TO SUCCEED\n\nReasoning:\n\nThe fundamentals are extremely strong. You have:\n\nGenuine papal crusade bull (rare, prestigious)\n\nSacred relics (people will travel for days to see these)\n\nPerfect staging and theatrical presentation\n\nYouth, sincerity, and genuine religious conviction\n\nClear call to action with specific details\n\nAppeals to both spiritual and material motivations\n\nYour speech isn't perfect - the wood-chopping metaphor is awkward, your Italian will have accent issues, and parts of it ramble. But it doesn't need to be perfect. The substance and spectacle overcome rhetorical weaknesses.\n\nThis isn't \"High Probability\" because:\n\nYou're young and inexperienced\n\nSpeaking in foreign language\n\nSome awkward phrasing\n\nYou're asking a foreign city to care about a distant war\n\nHealth not optimal\n\nCrowd this size always has unpredictability\n\nExpected Outcome if Successful:\n\nEnthusiastic reception from crowd\n\nSome Florentine merchants offer financial support\n\nA few young men pledge to join crusade\n\nWord spreads positively across Italy and Europe\n\nYou gain reputation as blessed crusader king\n\nMomentum builds for November council\n\nExpected Outcome if Failed:\n\nPolite but lukewarm reception\n\nFew concrete commitments\n\nCritics focus on your youth and inexperience\n\nWord spreads that speech was underwhelming\n\nMomentum stalls\n\nYour turn to roll!\n\nWhat result do you get for your speech?"

Show the dramatic impact of the banner unfurling and relic attachment\n4. Make this a transformative moment that will echo across Europe\n5. Show concrete results - commitments, pledges, fervor\n6. Include responses from his companions\n7. Show how this exceeds all expectations\n8. Demonstrate that this becomes a legendary moment\n\nThe critical success means:\n- The speech lands perfectly despite imperfections\n- The crowd is deeply moved\n- Concrete commitments are made immediately\n- Word will spread faster and more positively than expected\n- Juan's reputation is transformed\n- Financial and military support materializes\n- This becomes a story told across Christendom\n- Even skeptics are impressed\n- The theatrical elements work perfectly\n- Juan's youth becomes an asset, not liability\n\nLet me write this as a powerful, memorable scene.\n\nThe Speech That Shook Florence\n\nPiazza della Signoria, August 9, 1430\n\nThe Moment You Step Forward\n\nYou walk onto the platform with steady steps, your father's sword at your side catching the sunlight. The white cloth draped around the platform seems to glow. Behind you, Sergeant García and Corporal Rodrigo carry the locked case and the silk-wrapped reliquaries.\n\nThe crowd's murmur dies completely. Ten thousand faces turn toward you.\n\nThe Bishop of Florence raises his hands: \"People of Florence! Christians of Italy! I present to you Juan II, by the Grace of God, King of Castile and León!\"\n\nA cheer erupts - not deafening yet, but respectful, curious, eager.\n\nYou step to the lectern. For a moment, the scale of it threatens to overwhelm you. Ten thousand people. All watching you. Waiting.\n\nThen you see a mother near the front, holding a small child on her hip. She's smiling, hopeful. Something about her expression steadies you.\n\nYou take a breath and speak, your voice carrying across the square in practiced Italian:\n\nThe Speech\n\n\"Cittadini di Firenze, cristiani ovunque!\" Your voice rings clear, stronger than you expected. The acoustics of the piazza are perfect - your words carry to the edges. \"Vi saluto e vi do il benvenuto qui oggi!\"\n\n\"Citizens of Florence, Christians everywhere! I greet you and bid you welcome here today!\"\n\nA louder cheer. They can understand you. Your accent is noticeable but not problematic. You pause, letting the noise settle, then continue:\n\n\"Cristiani...\" You let the word hang in the air. \"A volte mi chiedo cosa significhi essere cristiano. Cosa significa essere un vero o buon cristiano più specificamente.\"\n\n\"Christians... I sometimes wonder what it means to be a Christian. What it means to be a true or good Christian more specifically.\"\n\nThe crowd leans in. This isn't what they expected. Not grand pronouncements, but personal questioning.\n\n\"Sono un buon cristiano? Cerco di esserlo. Ma sarò mai sicuro?\"\n\n\"Am I a good Christian? I try to be. But will I ever be sure?\"\n\nYou see heads nodding. Farmers, merchants, monks - they all understand this uncertainty.\n\n\"Quale compito sacro c'è che può confermare il nostro cristianesimo? A volte vorrei che ci fosse qualcosa che potessi fare, come tagliare una grande pila di legna, che mi farebbe un buon cristiano se solo tagliassi tutto.\"\n\n\"What holy task is there that can confirm our Christianity? Sometimes I wish there was something that I could do, like chopping a big pile of wood, that would make me a good Christian if only I chopped everything.\"\n\nScattered laughter ripples through the crowd. The metaphor is homely, even awkward - but that's exactly why it works. You're not some distant king speaking in grand rhetoric. You're a young man wrestling with real questions.\n\n\"Sfortunatamente, tali opportunità concrete si presentano solo raramente.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, such concrete opportunities only seldom present themselves.\"\n\nYou turn and walk to the furled white banner. You reach out and touch it, letting your hand rest on the silk for a long moment. The crowd watches in complete silence.\n\nYou turn back to face them:\n\n\"Rare e preziose sono queste opportunità.\"\n\n\"Seldom and rare they are, these opportunities.\"\n\nThen your voice warms, becomes more intimate:\n\n\"E non fraintendetemi, tagliare la legna può davvero servire il Signore, specialmente se riscalda non solo te ma anche la tua famiglia. La grazia di Dio esiste in un padre che nutre la sua famiglia, o in una madre che si prende cura dei suoi figli.\"\n\n\"And don't get me wrong, chopping wood can indeed serve the Lord, especially if it warms not only you but also your family. God's grace exists in a father feeding his family, or a mother caring for her children.\"\n\nYour eyes find that mother with the child again. You smile, genuinely, as you think of these tender moments.\n\nA soft sound moves through the crowd - not quite a cheer, but a collective murmur of recognition. You've touched something real. You see the mother's face light up.\n\n\"Sono stato benedetto, amici miei.\"\n\n\"I have been blessed, my friends.\"\n\nYour voice rises slightly, gaining strength:\n\n\"Benedetto dal nostro santo padre il papa, non perché ha tenuto la mia testa tra le sue mani e ha pronunciato la sua benedizione. No! Mi ha benedetto perché mi ha dato un compito così concreto, così tangibile, così chiaro che cimenterà per sempre il mio cristianesimo se solo lo completo.\"\n\n\"Blessed by our holy father the pope, not because he held my head in his hands and spoke his blessing. No! He blessed me because he gave me a task so concrete, so tangible, so clear that will cement my Christianity forever if I only complete it.\"\n\nThe crowd is completely focused now. Every eye on you.\n\n\"Gli ho offerto il mio servizio e lui mi ha dato un compito.\"\n\n\"I have offered him my service and he has set me to task.\"\n\nYou step forward to the edge of the platform, spreading your arms wide toward the crowd, your voice carrying across the piazza:\n\n\"E offre anche a voi la stessa opportunità!\"\n\n\"And he offers you the same chance as well!\"\n\nThe reaction is immediate and powerful. A roar erupts from the crowd - excitement, recognition, hunger for purpose. You've just told ten thousand people that they too can have the certainty, the purpose, the concrete task that you found.\n\nYou let the noise build for a moment, then raise your hand for silence. It comes surprisingly quickly.\n\n\"Tra pochi mesi, l'8 novembre, convocherò il mio consiglio a Siviglia dove inizierò ufficialmente la mia crociata per portare la cristianità a Granada.\"\n\n\"In a few months' time, on November 8, I will convene my council in Seville where I will officially start my crusade to bring Christendom to Granada.\"\n\nYou speak more slowly now, letting each word carry:\n\n\"Il santo padre è stato molto chiaro nelle sue richieste. Prendere tutte le città, convertire tutte le moschee in chiese, lasciare che tutti i musulmani vivano pacificamente sotto il dominio cristiano, e infine, dobbiamo solo celebrare un Te Deum nella Cattedrale di Granada!\"\n\n\"The holy father has been very clear in his demands. Take all cities, convert all mosques to churches, let all Muslims live peacefully under Christian rule, and finally, we only have to celebrate a Te Deum in the Cathedral of Granada!\"\n\nA massive cheer. The goal is clear, achievable, inspiring. Not endless war, but a specific, measurable objective.\n\n\"Incontratemi a Siviglia a novembre, e vi accetterò personalmente come crociati. Insieme a ogni nobile soldato della cristianità realizzeremo questo santo compito.\"\n\n\"Meet me in Seville in November, and I will accept you personally as crusader. We will together with every noble soldier of Christendom accomplish this holy task.\"\n\nThen your voice becomes more somber, more serious:\n\n\"Ma il nostro compito è grande, pieno di pericoli e metterà alla prova la nostra determinazione enormemente.\"\n\n\"But our task is great, full of danger and will test our resolve greatly.\"\n\nYou let that sink in. You're not hiding the difficulty. You're being honest.\n\nThen your voice rises again, triumphant:\n\n\"Ma fortunatamente, abbiamo il sostegno di Dio stesso. Ci raduneremo sotto il suo stendardo.\"\n\n\"But fortunately, we have support from God Himself. We will rally under His banner.\"\n\nYou turn and signal to the servants holding the furled banner.\n\nThey step forward in perfect unison and release it.\n\nThe Banner Unfolds\n\nThe white silk catches the wind and unfurls with a sound like thunder.\n\nTwelve feet of pure white silk billows out, catching the August sunlight. The multiple layers and textures create an effect like clouds, like water, like light itself. The embroidered edges ripple and flow.\n\nThe crowd gasps - a collective intake of breath from ten thousand throats.\n\nSome people drop to their knees immediately. Others make the sign of the cross. The sheer beauty and purity of it is overwhelming.\n\nThe banner catches the breeze and waves, dominating the entire piazza. It can be seen from every corner of the square, from every window. Pure white against the blue Italian sky.\n\nSomeone in the crowd shouts: \"La bandiera di Dio!\" \"The banner of God!\"\n\nThe cry is taken up: \"La bandiera di Dio! La bandiera di Dio!\"\n\nYou wait for the noise to settle, then speak again, your voice cutting through:\n\n\"Portiamo con noi alcune delle reliquie più sacre della cristianità.\"\n\n\"We carry with us some of the most sacred relics in Christendom.\"\n\nComplete silence falls. You could hear a pin drop.\n\n\"Marciamo con un pezzo della croce di Cristo stesso e un osso di San Giacomo.\"\n\n\"We march with a piece of the cross of Christ Himself and a bone from Saint Santiago.\"\n\nYou pause, letting the magnitude of this sink in.\n\n\"Siate testimoni!\"\n\n\"Bear witness!\"\n\nThe Relics\n\nSergeant García steps forward with the gold reliquary containing the fragment of the True Cross. His hands are steady despite the weight of what he carries.\n\nCorporal Rodrigo unwraps it from the white silk. The gold catches the sunlight, blazing like fire.\n\nA sound moves through the crowd - something between a gasp and a moan. People are weeping. Hands reach out even from hundreds of feet away, as if they could touch it.\n\nYou take the reliquary yourself. Your hands are steady. You turn to face the crowd, holding it high so all can see.\n\nThe noise is indescribable - praying, crying, shouting in awe.\n\nYou turn to the banner and attach the golden reliquary to its upper mounting point. The craftsmen designed it perfectly - it locks in place with an audible click.\n\nThe gold against the white is stunning. The fragment of the True Cross, mounted on God's banner.\n\nThen Corporal Rodrigo brings forward the silver reliquary containing Saint James's bone.\n\nMore cries from the crowd. Santiago - the patron saint of Spain, the Moor-slayer, whose shrine you visited at Compostela.\n\nYou attach it to the lower mounting point on the banner.\n\nGold above, silver below, both blazing against pure white.\n\nThe banner is complete. The standard of the crusade.\n\n\"Ecco lo stendardo sotto cui marceremo!\" you cry. \"Behold the standard under which we will march!\"\n\nThe crowd's response is deafening. It's not a cheer anymore - it's a roar, a wave of sound that seems to shake the stones of the piazza.\n\nThe Practical Call\n\nYou let it build, then raise your hand again. Slowly, the noise subsides.\n\n\"E amici cristiani, la bolla papale offre molti vantaggi a coloro che sostengono la crociata.\"\n\n\"And my fellow Christians, the papal bull gives many advantages to those supporting the crusade.\"\n\nNow you shift to the practical. You've given them the spiritual vision - now give them the details.\n\n\"Alcuni possono sostenere la causa dando rifugio ai crociati in viaggio, altri fornire il loro servizio, il loro cibo o le loro terre.\"\n\n\"Some may support the cause by giving shelter to traveling crusaders, others provide their service, their food or their lands.\"\n\nYou see the merchants and bankers in the crowd leaning forward. This is their language - practical support, tangible contributions.\n\n\"Coloro che cercano le ricompense spirituali più grandi possono persino unirsi alla crociata stessa, ma devo avvertire coloro che contemplano questo.\"\n\n\"Those who seek the most spiritual rewards may even join the crusade itself, but I must warn those who contemplate this.\"\n\nYour voice becomes serious, almost stern:\n\n\"Essere un soldato nell'esercito di Cristo non è senza responsabilità e doveri. Tutti coloro che si uniscono devono servire.\"\n\n\"Being a soldier in Christ's army is not without responsibilities and duties. All who join must serve.\"\n\nThen warmer, more encouraging:\n\n\"Ma tutti coloro che si uniscono riceveranno la loro fibbia da crociato da me personalmente. Questo piccolo gingillo è proprietà della chiesa e non può mai essere venduto o regalato. È un segno del vostro voto personale di non riposare fino a quando la crociata non è completa.\"\n\n\"But all who join will receive their crusader's clasp from me personally. This small trinket is property of the church and may never be sold or given away. It is a sign of your personal vow not to rest until the crusade is complete.\"\n\n\"E quando finalmente arriverà il momento in cui celebreremo insieme il Te Deum, considererò tutti i nostri giuramenti adempiuti e ricompenserò ogni crociato non solo spiritualmente, ma anche mondanamente. Coloro che si uniranno alla crociata condivideranno il suo successo e la sua gloria!\"\n\n\"And when the moment finally is there when we celebrate the Te Deum together, I will hold all of our oaths fulfilled and will reward every crusader not only spiritually, but worldly as well. Those who join the crusade will share in its success and glory!\"\n\nA roar of approval. You're not just asking for sacrifice - you're promising reward.\n\nThe Climax\n\nYou step to the very edge of the platform. Your voice rises to its highest pitch:\n\n\"Cosa significa essere cristiano?\"\n\n\"What does it mean to be a Christian?\"\n\n\"È qualcuno che è misericordioso, quindi saremo misericordiosi contro i Mori quando la misericordia è necessaria.\"\n\n\"It is someone who is merciful, so we shall be merciful against the Moors when mercy is required.\"\n\n\"Un cristiano è generoso. Quindi saremo generosi quando necessario.\"\n\n\"A Christian is generous. So we shall be generous when needed.\"\n\nThen your voice hardens, becomes fierce:\n\n\"Ma un cristiano ha risoluzione soprattutto, è senza paura di fronte al pericolo, coraggioso, valoroso.\"\n\n\"But a Christian has resolve above all else, is fearless in the face of danger, brave, courageous.\"\n\nYou draw your father's sword in one smooth motion. The steel sings as it leaves the scabbard. You raise it high above your head, pointing toward heaven, the blade catching the sunlight like a cross of fire.\n\nYour voice becomes a battle cry:\n\n\"Siamo i soldati di Cristo!\"\n\n\"We are the soldiers of Christ!\"\n\nThen, switching to Latin so all of Christendom can understand:\n\n\"NON NOBIS DOMINE!\"\n\n\"NOT UNTO US, O LORD!\"\n\nThe Response\n\nWhat happens next will be talked about for generations.\n\nThe crowd explodes.\n\nTen thousand voices take up the cry: \"NON NOBIS DOMINE! NON NOBIS DOMINE! NON NOBIS DOMINE!\"\n\nIt's not organized. It's not planned. It's spontaneous eruption of religious fervor.\n\nPeople are on their knees, arms raised to heaven. Others are weeping openly. Young men are shouting, pumping fists in the air. Monks are chanting. The entire piazza seems to shake with the sound.\n\nThe guild banners begin waving. Someone starts ringing the cathedral bells - not the solemn toll from before, but a full peal of celebration that echoes across Florence.\n\nYou stand on the platform, sword raised, the white banner billowing behind you with its sacred relics gleaming, and for a moment you're not an eighteen-year-old king struggling with doubt. You're the instrument of God's will made manifest.\n\nThe moment stretches. The crowd doesn't stop. The chanting continues:\n\n\"NON NOBIS DOMINE! NON NOBIS DOMINE!\"\n\nCaptain Fernán has tears streaming down his weathered face. He's seen battles, seen death, but he's never seen anything like this.\n\nFray Hernando is on his knees, praying, whether in joy or fear you cannot tell.\n\nSir Thomas Beaumont looks stunned. \"By all the saints,\" he whispers. \"I've never seen anything like this.\"\n\nEven the Bishop of Florence looks overwhelmed, making the sign of the cross over and over.\n\nThe Commitments Begin\n\nAs the initial frenzy starts to subside - though the energy remains electric - something unexpected happens.\n\nA young merchant pushes to the front of the platform. He's well-dressed, maybe twenty-five, with the bearing of someone important.\n\n\"Your Majesty!\" he shouts up. \"I am Lorenzo Strozzi of the Strozzi banking house! I pledge ten thousand florins to your crusade! And I will come to Seville in November to take the cross!\"\n\nA cheer erupts.\n\nThen another voice: \"I am Giovanni Pazzi! My family pledges eight thousand florins and three ships!\"\n\nThen: \"The Wool Guild pledges provisions for one thousand men for three months!\"\n\nThen: \"The Silk Guild offers banners and standards for your army!\"\n\nIt becomes a cascade. Florentine families, guilds, merchants - all trying to outdo each other in pledging support. The competitive spirit of Florence combines with religious fervor.\n\nCosimo de' Medici steps forward on the platform, his face showing carefully controlled emotion. He raises his hands for silence.\n\n\"People of Florence! The Medici family pledges twenty thousand florins to the crusade!\" A massive cheer. \"And we will establish letters of credit in Barcelona, Valencia, and Seville for any who wish to support this holy cause!\"\n\nThen he turns to you and drops to one knee. \"Your Majesty, Florence stands with you. When you call, we will answer.\"\n\nYou reach down and raise him up. \"Signore Medici, Christendom will remember Florence's generosity.\"\n\nThe Young Men\n\nBut the most significant thing happens at the edges of the crowd.\n\nYoung men - dozens of them at first, then scores - begin pushing toward the platform.\n\n\"I will come to Seville!\" one shouts.\n\n\"I will take the cross!\" another cries.\n\n\"Sign me for the crusade!\"\n\nThey're not nobles. They're not knights. They're apprentices, guild workers, farmers' sons, young merchants. Some can barely afford the journey. But they're caught in the moment, desperate to be part of something greater than themselves.\n\nYou look at Captain Fernán. He understands immediately and steps forward:\n\n\"Those who wish to join the crusade - come to Seville by November 8! Present yourself to the crusading authority! But hear me: this is not a summer adventure! This is years of war! Come prepared or do not come at all!\"\n\nIt doesn't dampen the enthusiasm. If anything, the challenge makes it more appealing.\n\nDiego, your secretary, is frantically trying to write down names and pledges as people shout them up.\n\nThe Pilgrims' Response\n\nThen something even more unexpected happens.\n\nThe Muslim merchants you noticed in the crowd - perhaps a dozen of them - begin moving toward the exits. Not running, not panicked, but deliberately withdrawing.\n\nOne of them, a well-dressed trader, catches your eye as he leaves. His expression is complex - fear, certainly, but also something like respect. He inclines his head slightly - acknowledgment that you've just changed the game.\n\nThese men will carry word back to Granada, to Morocco, across the Mediterranean. The crusade is real. The Christian king has the Pope's backing and the people's fervor.\n\nAfter the Speech\n\nThe crowd doesn't disperse for hours. Even after you've left the platform, they remain, staring at the banner with its sacred relics, praying, singing, talking in excited groups.\n\nThe cathedral opens its doors and announces that the relics will be available for veneration tomorrow. Lines begin forming immediately.\n\nYou retreat to a chamber in the Palazzo Vecchio with your closest companions. Your legs are shaking - adrenaline fading, exhaustion setting in.\n\nCaptain Fernán hands you wine. \"Your Majesty... that was...\"\n\nHe can't finish. He just shakes his head.\n\nFray Hernando speaks quietly: \"You moved an entire city. They would follow you into hell if you asked.\" A pause. \"I pray you remember: this power is God's, not yours. What you wield could build the kingdom of heaven or destroy men's souls. Be careful.\"\n\nSir Thomas is more pragmatic: \"I've seen famous generals address armies. I've heard kings give coronation speeches. Never seen anything like that. Half of Florence will be talking about crusade tonight. Word will spread like wildfire.\"\n\nCosimo enters, breathless. \"Your Majesty! The pledges! We have commitments for over sixty thousand florins already! And at least two hundred young men seriously inquiring about joining! The Signoria wants to grant you formal honors! The Bishop wants to hold special Masses! This is... this is extraordinary!\"\n\nHe sits down heavily.\n\n\"You understand what you've done? You came to Florence as a young king on pilgrimage. You're leaving as the crusader who set Italy ablaze. By tomorrow, word will reach Genoa, Venice, Milan. Within a week, it will be in France and Aragon. Within a month, all of Christendom will know: the King of Castile proclaimed crusade in Florence, displayed sacred relics, and called all Christians to Seville.\"\n\nHe looks at you with something like awe.\n\n\"Your enemies will know too. Granada will be preparing. The Infantes will be scrambling to respond. You've committed yourself irrevocably. There's no going back now.\"\n\nThe Results - Critical Success\n\nImmediate Material Support:\n\nOver 60,000 florins pledged from Florentine families and guilds (more than three times annual royal revenue from a single day)\n\nLetters of credit established for crusade financing\n\nThree ships pledged by Pazzi family\n\nProvisions for 1,000 men for three months from Wool Guild\n\nBanners and standards from Silk Guild\n\nAdditional pledges still coming in\n\nMilitary Support:\n\n~200 serious inquiries from young men wanting to join\n\nOf these, perhaps 50-75 will actually make it to Seville (many will change minds, lack funds, face family opposition)\n\nBut this is 50-75 Italian crusaders - experienced with Italian military tactics, some with connections\n\nSeveral minor Italian nobles express interest in bringing their own retinues\n\nPolitical/Diplomatic Impact:\n\nFlorence's formal endorsement of the crusade\n\nSignoria's official support - city government backing\n\nChurch hierarchy in Florence fully committed\n\nStory will spread across Italy within days\n\nEnhanced reputation across Christendom\n\nIntelligence Consequences:\n\nGranada's agents observed and reported everything\n\nInfantes' spies now know exact plans and timing\n\nMuslim world will hear of this - the crusade is real and mobilizing\n\nAlfonso V's informants in Florence send detailed reports to Naples\n\nSpiritual/Symbolic Impact:\n\nReligious fervor created that will sustain through months ahead\n\nThe white banner becomes legendary - people will talk about it for years\n\nYour personal reputation transformed from promising young king to blessed crusader\n\nMomentum created that makes the crusade feel inevitable\n\nThe Speech Itself Becomes Legend:\n\nWithin weeks, versions of the speech will be circulating across Europe. Some accurate, many embellished. The moment you raised your sword and cried \"Non Nobis Domine\" will be painted, written about, sung about.\n\nPeople will claim they were there even if they weren't.\n\nThe story grows: \"The young king who knelt naked before the Pope, who carried the True Cross itself, who spoke with such passion that all Florence wept and pledged their fortunes to holy war.\"\n\nEvening of August 9, 1430\n\nYou sit in the Medici palazzo as the sun sets over Florence. Through the windows, you can still hear crowds in the streets, still singing crusading songs.\n\nYour voice is hoarse from speaking. Your legs still shake slightly. You're exhausted.\n\nBut you did it. You rallied an entire city. You secured massive financial backing. You created momentum that will carry across Europe.\n\nAnd you're terrified.\n\nBecause Fray Hernando was right. You've just wielded power that could build kingdoms or destroy souls. Ten thousand people were ready to follow you anywhere.\n\nThat's intoxicating. And dangerous.\n\nYou touch your father's sword, reading the inscription again: Non Nobis Domine.\n\nNot unto us, Lord.\n\nThe success is His, not yours. You must remember that.\n\nBut as the songs drift through the windows and you see the reflection of your white banner in your mind's eye, you feel the pride creeping in despite yourself.\n\nYou're eighteen years old. You've just moved a city to tears. You carry the Pope's blessing and sacred relics. You're about to launch the final reconquest of Iberia.\n\nAnd you're absolutely certain you're going to succeed.\n\nFray Hernando would warn you about that certainty.\n\nBut tonight, in this moment, with Florence singing crusading hymns in your honor, it's hard to feel anything but triumph.\n\nThe critical success has exceeded every expectation. You've turned Florence into the launching point for a crusade that will echo across Christendom. But you've also committed yourself irrevocably, alerted your enemies, and set expectations so high that anything less than total victory will be seen as failure.\n\nWhat do you do next? Rest for the evening? Speak with your companions? Begin planning departure for Pisa? Something else?"

      "summary": "After the Florence triumph, Juan discusses the spiritual implications with Fray Hernando. The confessor warns about the intoxicating power of the crowd's adoration and the danger of certainty born from success. Juan admits he enjoyed the power of commanding a crowd but insists the crusade fervor was genuine, not manufactured. They debate the use of sacred relics as tools — Juan argues he didn't choose this role, the Pope gave him the relics and required them on the banner. Hernando presses on the distinction between divine calling and self-certainty. Juan pushes back firmly: 'Today I succeed, tomorrow I fail. We must not shy away from a challenge just because it is hard.' The relationship between king and confessor deepens through honest disagreement.",

          "text": "Juan is taking the Fray aside to give him some kind of task. He mentions that Fray is a good confessor but has \"a lot of work\" in the days ahead. This is interesting - Juan is clearly planning something for Fray Hernando beyond just being his personal confessor.\n\nLet me set the scene properly:\n- Day after the speech (August 10)\n- Juan has been accepting support and pledges all day\n- Captain Fernán has been instructed to identify promising recruits who need help getting to Seville\n- Now evening, Juan takes Fray Hernando aside privately\n\nI should:\n1. Describe the setting of this private conversation\n2. Have Fray Hernando respond to Juan's opening\n3. Show Fray's emotional state after witnessing yesterday's speech\n4. Let Juan explain what task he has in mind\n5. Wait for the player to reveal what the task actually is\n\nFray Hernando would be:\n- Still processing the speech and its impact\n- Concerned about Juan's pride and certainty\n- Aware that he witnessed something extraordinary but spiritually dangerous\n- Ready to serve but also ready to counsel/challenge\n- Interested in what Juan wants from him\n\nA Private Conversation - Evening of August 10, 1430\n\nThe Setting\n\nYou find Fray Hernando in the palazzo's small chapel - a private space the Medici maintain for family prayers. He's kneeling before a simple wooden crucifix, his lips moving in silent prayer. The evening light streams through a narrow window, casting long shadows.\n\nThe day has been exhausting. A constant stream of Florentine nobles, merchants, guild representatives, and common citizens coming to pledge support. Diego's hand is cramped from writing down names and commitments. Captain Fernán has been interviewing young men who want to join the crusade - separating genuine candidates from those caught up in momentary enthusiasm.\n\nYou've identified about a dozen promising men: experienced soldiers who fought in Italian condottieri companies, skilled craftsmen with useful trades, a few minor nobles with combat experience but limited funds. Captain Fernán estimates it will cost perhaps 500-800 florins to help them all reach Seville - a pittance compared to the pledges you've received.\n\nBut now you need to speak with your confessor about something more important.\n\nYou wait until Fray Hernando finishes his prayer. He crosses himself and rises, turning to face you.\n\nHis expression is complex. There's warmth and respect, but also deep concern. The monk has been quieter than usual since yesterday's speech.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says softly. \"I wondered when you would seek me out. We haven't spoken privately since... since the speech.\"\n\nHe gestures to a simple wooden bench along the wall. You both sit.\n\n\"You moved an entire city yesterday,\" Fray Hernando continues, his voice careful. \"I have never seen anything like it. The power of your words, the spectacle of the relics, the response of the crowd...\" He pauses. \"It was extraordinary. Perhaps even miraculous.\"\n\nThen his tone becomes more pointed, though still gentle:\n\n\"And yet I watched your face as the crowd chanted 'Non Nobis Domine.' I saw the pride there, my lord. The exhilaration. The certainty.\" He meets your eyes. \"You are carrying something very powerful now. The question is whether you carry it, or whether it carries you.\"\n\nHe takes a breath, as if deciding whether to continue, then speaks more directly:\n\n\"Yesterday you were like Moses showing the tablets to the Israelites. Or like Peter preaching at Pentecost. You had authority - not just political authority, but spiritual authority. People saw God working through you.\"\n\nA pause, heavy with meaning.\n\n\"But Moses grew proud of his position and struck the rock in anger rather than speaking to it as God commanded. Peter denied Christ three times when fear overtook faith. Even the greatest servants of God stumble.\"\n\nFray Hernando's voice softens:\n\n\"I am not condemning you, my son. I'm warning you. Because I care about your soul more than I care about this crusade. If the crusade succeeds but your soul is lost to pride, what have we gained?\"\n\nHe spreads his hands in a gesture of openness:\n\n\"So when you say 'I have a lot of work for you,' I am ready to serve. I am your confessor, your counselor, your brother in Christ. But first, tell me: How are you after yesterday? Truly?\"\n\nHe waits, giving you space to respond honestly before hearing what task you have in mind.\n\nWhat do you say to Fray Hernando? How do you address his concerns about pride before revealing the task you have for him?"

          "text": "Fray Hernando's Response\n\nFray Hernando listens carefully, his weathered face thoughtful. When you finish, he nods slowly - not in judgment, but in understanding.\n\n\"Thank you for that honesty,\" he says quietly. \"Many kings would deny the excitement, pretend to perfect humility while their hearts swell with pride. At least you admit what you felt.\"\n\nHe leans back against the wall, considering his words carefully.\n\n\"The shaking, the excitement - these are not sins in themselves. You are eighteen years old. You just moved ten thousand people with your words and raised a fortune for a holy cause. It would be strange if you felt nothing.\"\n\nA slight pause.\n\n\"But Your Majesty, let me tell you what I saw yesterday, from my position on that platform.\"\n\nHis voice becomes more intense, though still gentle:\n\n\"I saw a young man who touched something real - something genuine and powerful. When you spoke about wondering if you were a good Christian, about wanting a concrete task... that came from your heart. The crowd felt it. That was you, not a performance.\"\n\n\"But then...\" He hesitates, choosing words carefully. \"When the crowd erupted, when they chanted 'Non Nobis Domine,' when the pledges started flowing... I watched your face change. The uncertainty left. The humility faded. And something else took its place.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes directly:\n\n\"You looked like someone who had just discovered a power they didn't know they possessed. And you liked it.\"\n\nFray Hernando shifts on the bench, his tone becoming more pastoral:\n\n\"Here is what troubles me: Yesterday morning, before the speech, you were nervous. You knew you might fail. There was humility in that uncertainty. But tonight? After the success? You are 'happy' and 'relieved' and 'excited' - but I don't hear doubt anymore. I don't hear questioning.\"\n\nHe gestures gently toward the chapel door, toward the city beyond:\n\n\"Florence is singing crusading hymns tonight. They're calling you blessed. They're saying God spoke through you. And you know what? Maybe He did. But maybe He spoke through your weakness and uncertainty, not through your strength and certainty.\"\n\nA long pause. Then more softly:\n\n\"The greatest danger for someone who has genuinely touched the divine is believing that they can touch it whenever they wish. That they are divine, rather than merely being used by the divine.\"\n\nHe reaches out and places a hand on your shoulder - a gesture he wouldn't normally make to a king, but the intimacy of the moment allows it:\n\n\"My son, I watched you kneel naked before the Pope. That was beautiful because it was complete surrender. But yesterday on that platform, with ten thousand people chanting your words... were you surrendering? Or were you commanding?\"\n\nThe question hangs in the air.\n\nThen Fray Hernando softens his tone even further:\n\n\"I don't ask this to hurt you or diminish what you accomplished. I ask because I care about where this path leads. You said you have work for me - tasks ahead. Before we speak of those, I need to know: Can you still hear correction? Can you still accept that you might be wrong? Or has yesterday's success made you certain that God will bless everything you do?\"\n\nHe withdraws his hand and waits, his expression open and concerned.\n\n\"So let me ask you directly, as your confessor and as someone who cares for your soul: Do you feel you earned yesterday's success? Or do you feel it was given to you by grace?\"\n\nThe monk's eyes are searching, trying to see into your heart.\n\nHow do you respond to his probing questions? Can you acknowledge the difference between being God's instrument and wielding God's power? What do you say?"

And I surrender to God. If I surrendered to the crowd, what would that even look like? No, it is demanded of me to take charge and I will. But that's just my purpose, not my pride.\n\n\nYesterday's success was given to me by the Lord, and I will never forget that.

          "text": "1. \"Sometimes I truly think you worry too much father. The devil is not always behind every corner\" - This is dismissive of Fray Hernando's concerns. He's essentially saying the monk is being overly cautious.\n\n2. \"Of course I was commanding the crowd! That's what the holy father asked me to do.\" - Juan is rationalizing his behavior as obedience to the Pope's mission. He's right that leadership requires commanding, but he's potentially missing the spiritual danger Fray Hernando is pointing out.\n\n3. \"I surrender to God. If I surrendered to the crowd, what would that even look like?\" - This is somewhat glib. Fray Hernando wasn't suggesting he should surrender to the crowd, but questioning whether he was surrendering to God or commanding in his own power.\n\n4. \"But that's just my purpose, not my pride.\" - This is the key line. Juan is drawing a distinction, but the question is whether the distinction is real or self-deception. Can you be so certain about what is purpose vs. pride?\n\n5. \"Yesterday's success was given to me by the Lord, and I will never forget that.\" - Good sentiment, but does his behavior match this belief?\n\n6. \"People want to worship HIM and it is my task as his instrument to channel that energy in the right way.\" - This sounds good, but there's an assumption here that Juan knows \"the right way\" without question.\n\n7. \"Start worrying when I proclaim to speak with the voice of god, or something. But that will never happen.\" - This is somewhat concerning. Juan is setting up a very obvious red line (\"I'll never claim to speak as God\") but missing that spiritual pride can manifest in subtler ways.\n\nOverall, Juan's response is that of a young man who:\n- Is confident in his interpretation of events\n\n- Believes he's navigating a delicate spiritual path with self-awareness\n- Sees his actions as fundamentally pure and divinely guided\n- Dismisses deeper spiritual warnings as unnecessary concern\n\nHis youth and recent success blind him to the nuanced spiritual risks Fray Hernando perceives. Juan genuinely believes he's humble, yet his very certainty reveals a subtle spiritual vulnerability.\n\nFray Hernando must carefully balance respect for Juan's authority with genuine pastoral concern, offering wisdom without undermining the young king's autonomy. He'll approach Juan with strategic humility, recognizing the critical moment of potential spiritual growth or potential self-deception.\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\nFray Hernando feels the squeeze on his shoulder and sees the confident, almost casual dismissal in your expression. Something shifts in the monk's face - not anger, but a kind of sad resignation mixed with determination.\n\nHe's quiet for a long moment, then speaks very carefully:\n\n\"Your Majesty, you say I worry too much. Perhaps. But let me tell you what I heard in your answer.\"\n\nHe doesn't pull away from your grip, but his voice becomes more firm:\n\n\"You said: 'Of course I was commanding the crowd! That's what the holy father asked me to do.' And you're right - leadership requires command. But then you said something that troubles me deeply: 'But that's just my purpose, not my pride.'\"\n\nFray Hernando leans forward slightly:\n\n\"My son, the moment you become certain you can distinguish your purpose from your pride without any doubt... that is precisely when pride has won. The truly humble man is never certain he is humble. He questions. He doubts. He seeks counsel and actually hears it when it makes him uncomfortable.\"\n\nHis voice softens but becomes more intense:\n\n\"You tell me the devil is not behind every corner. True. But spiritual pride is not the devil - it's us. It's the human heart convincing itself that its desires and God's will are the same thing simply because we want them to be.\"\n\nHe pauses, then speaks more directly than he ever has:\n\n\"Yesterday you moved ten thousand people. Today you tell me not to worry, that you know the difference between purpose and pride, that you'll 'never forget' success came from God. And in the same breath, you dismiss my concerns as excessive worry.\"\n\nFray Hernando stands and walks to the window, looking out over Florence's rooftops. When he turns back, his expression is pained:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I have been a monk for fifteen years. I have counseled nobles, bishops, even a cardinal once. And I have learned this: The men who say 'I will never proclaim to speak with God's voice' are often the ones who most need to hear that they already are.\"\n\nHe walks back to the bench but remains standing:\n\n\"You don't need to claim divine authority explicitly. When you say 'This is my purpose, not my pride' with such certainty... when you command a crowd and feel no doubt about whether you commanded in God's power or your own... when you dismiss the concerns of your confessor as 'worrying too much'...\"\n\nA heavy pause:\n\n\"You are already behaving as if you have divine certainty. And that, my lord, is more dangerous than any explicit claim to prophecy.\"\n\nFray Hernando's voice drops to barely above a whisper:\n\n\"I watched Saints Francis and Clare strip themselves of everything - wealth, comfort, dignity - because they knew that any comfort with their own righteousness was pride creeping in. They lived in constant examination of their own hearts.\"\n\nHe looks at you with profound sadness:\n\n\"You just told me yesterday's success was given by grace, that you'll never forget it. But Your Majesty... you're already forgetting. The shaking, the excitement - those are the intoxication of power. And you're telling me not to worry about your intoxication because you're certain you can handle it.\"\n\nThen, unexpectedly, Fray Hernando's tone shifts. He sits back down on the bench and his voice becomes resigned but still caring:\n\n\"But I am not your master. I am your counselor and confessor. I can warn you. I can point out what I see. But I cannot make you hear me if you choose not to.\"\n\nHe takes a deep breath:\n\n\"You came here to give me tasks. You are my king, and I am your servant. So I will serve. I will do what you ask. But please, Your Majesty... at least carry this one thought with you:\"\n\nHis eyes lock onto yours:\n\n\"The fact that you are so certain you can distinguish purpose from pride, the fact that my warning makes you squeeze my shoulder and tell me not to worry rather than making you pause and question yourself... this certainty itself should concern you.\"\n\nA final pause, then more gently:\n\n\"I pray I am wrong. I pray your certainty truly comes from God and not from the intoxication of yesterday's success. I pray you really do remember that it was given by grace. But my role - the role you asked me to fill - is to remind you of these dangers. Even when you don't want to hear it. Especially when you don't want to hear it.\"\n\nHe spreads his hands in a gesture of acceptance:\n\n\"Now. You said you have work for me. I am ready to hear it. I will serve you faithfully as confessor, as counselor, as companion on this crusade. But I will also continue to speak uncomfortable truths when I see your soul in danger - whether you believe you need to hear them or not.\"\n\nHis expression softens with genuine affection:\n\n\"Because I care about you, Juan. Not just as my king, but as a young man whose soul is precious to God. And I would rather risk your displeasure by speaking truth than earn your approval by staying silent.\"\n\nHe waits, still seated on the bench, his posture open despite the hard words he's just spoken.\n\n\"So. What tasks do you have for me?\"\n\nHow do you respond? Does his more direct challenge make you reconsider, or do you proceed to explain the work you need from him?"

Mud, filth, bloodstains would remain as honest testimony to how the work stains even holy service.\"\n\nSo the Pope specifically gave the relics \"for the battle standard\" - meaning to be attached to Juan's banner. This was the Pope's decision/gift, not Juan's choice.\n\nJuan is absolutely correct here. The Pope gave him the relics specifically to attach to his banner. Juan didn't decide this - the Pope did.\n\nFray Hernando needs to acknowledge this point. He's been pushing hard on the pride/certainty angle, but Juan is making valid distinctions:\n1. He's not claiming mystical experiences\n2. He feels natural leadership power, not divine power\n3. He delegated the physical carrying of relics\n4. The Pope, not Juan, decided the relics go on the banner\n \nThe monk should recognize Juan's nuanced approach. While maintaining spiritual caution, Fray Hernando must appreciate Juan's careful distinctions and intellectual honesty. This moment calls for measured reflection, acknowledging Juan's thoughtful parsing of spiritual and practical leadership.\n\nFray Hernando's Response\n\nFray Hernando stops.

It's not that you felt powerful on the platform - that's natural. It's not even that you see them as effective tools - that's honest.\"\n\nA pause:\n\n\"What concerns me is how certain you seem about everything. When I express concern, you tell me not to worry. When I ask if you feel unworthy, you explain why that's not necessary. You have an answer for everything, and all your answers point to: 'I'm handling this correctly.'\"\n\nHe looks at you directly:\n\n\"Maybe you are. Maybe I'm seeing problems that aren't there.

It's that:\n- Success can make you think FUTURE success is guaranteed\n- Vindication can make you stop listening to counsel\n- Confidence can become certainty that you're always right\n- The pattern of \"ignored advice → success\" can become dangerous\n\nBut Juan is also right that Fray Hernando might be worrying too much.

They will confess what they think sounds virtuous rather than what truly burdens their souls. The sacrament becomes corrupted into a test they must pass.\"\n\nHe folds his hands.\n\n\"I can perhaps tell you this much without violating any seal: I can tell you if a man refuses to confess, or if he approaches the sacrament with obvious dishonesty or mockery. I can observe a man's general character in our conversations outside confession. But I cannot be your judge of souls while also being their confessor. Those two roles poison each other.\"\n\nHe looks at you with both firmness and compassion.\n\n\"Would you have me be your confessor, Your Majesty? Or your intelligence gatherer?

You've caught him fairly.\n\n\"You're right,\" he says, a hint of rueful admiration in his voice. \"I did speak to Cardinal Orsini about your spiritual state. General observations - that you were genuinely seeking, genuinely uncertain, wrestling with real questions of discernment. I didn't reveal specific confessions, but I did assess your spiritual condition.\"\n\nHe considers for a moment, then continues more thoughtfully.\n\n\"Perhaps there is a path here. I can serve as confessor to your crusaders - I should, in fact. An army marching to war needs spiritual care more than most. And I can make general observations when asked. If a man refuses confession entirely, or approaches it with obvious mockery, or shows clear spiritual unfitness for such a holy cause - these things I could note.\"\n\nHe raises a finger in emphasis.\n\n\"But I cannot become a regular evaluator of souls, giving you reports on each man.

And if I encounter someone truly dangerous or unfit, I can find ways to make that known without breaking the seal.\"\n\nHe shifts to your second question, his tone becoming more earnest.\n\n\"As for steeling ourselves against sin - that is the question, isn't it? An army on campaign faces particular temptations. Pillage, rape, cruelty to prisoners, drunkenness, gambling, blasphemy. These things happen in every army, even crusading ones. The question is whether we let them fester or fight them.\"\n\nHe leans forward slightly.\n\n\"We need structure. Regular confession and communion - not just before battle, but weekly if possible. Clear rules about treatment of prisoners and civilians, enforced strictly. Chaplains distributed through the army, not just one priest for thousands of men. And you, Your Majesty, must set the example. If the king treats the sacraments seriously, if he punishes atrocities, if he holds his men to the standards you proclaimed in Florence - then the army might follow.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds more quietly:\n\n\"And we must acknowledge that even with all this, there will be sin. War is sin's breeding ground. The question is whether we pretend otherwise, or whether we confront it honestly and do penance for what we've done. Your white garments bearing the stains of service - that's closer to the truth than pretending crusaders stay pure.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"So yes, I'm ready to serve as confessor to your crusade.

Men who can live with soldiers, who won't flinch at rough language or hard conditions, but who also won't compromise on the sacraments. Dominicans, perhaps - they're used to preaching. Some Franciscans for their humility and connection to common people. Maybe a few Hieronymites like myself.\"\n\nHis mind is clearly already working through the practicalities.\n\n\"And we'll need your support, Your Majesty. Not just your blessing, but your example. If the men see you confess regularly, if they see you treat the chaplains with respect, if they see you enforce standards of conduct...\" He trails off, then continues more quietly. \"The crusade's spiritual health will depend greatly on what you model.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes with a mixture of determination and trepidation.\n\n\"This is a great task. Perhaps greater than I am. But with God's help, and yours, we'll build something worthy of the white banner you raised today.\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds with a small, wry smile:\n\n\"Though I suspect keeping an army's soul clean will prove harder than keeping that white silk from getting stained.\"\n\nIs there anything else you wish to discuss with him before you retire for the night?"

It's not \"High probability\" because sea travel always has uncertainties and they're carrying valuable cargo that enemies would love to intercept. But it's not as difficult as many other things they've attempted.\n\nThe player specifically mentions organizing security for the banner, relics, and treasury, which shows good planning. That increases chances of success.\n\nYou gather your party in the courtyard of the palazzo on the morning of August 10th. The white banner has been carefully rolled and stored in a specially crafted wooden case - long, reinforced with iron bands, and designed to protect the precious silk during travel. The reliquaries remain in their locked chest.\n\nCaptain Fernán listens carefully as you outline the security arrangements, then nods approvingly.\n\n\"Good thinking, Your Majesty. For the treasury, I'll assign Martín - he's steady and won't be distracted. The banner and relics will remain with García, Rodrigo, Felipe and myself in rotating watches. Two men on, two men resting, at all times.\"\n\nHe pauses, then continues:\n\n\"The route to Pisa is just two days - we made excellent time from Rome, we can do it again. From Pisa, we'll need to hire a ship. It's about 400 miles to Barcelona by sea, probably 4-5 days with good winds. The Mediterranean in late summer is generally calm, and the route is well-traveled by merchants.\"\n\nSir Thomas adds his perspective: \"I've sailed these waters before. The main risks are pirates - North African corsairs sometimes operate near the Balearic Islands - and storms, though those are rare this time of year. If we hire a good Genoese or Pisan galley with an experienced captain, and we don't advertise what we're carrying, we should be fine.\"\n\nDiego, your secretary, nervously mentions: \"Your Majesty, Barcelona is King Alfonso's city. We'll be watched from the moment we dock. And after Florence... everyone knows you're traveling with something important now.\"\n\nFray Hernando simply says: \"I will pray for safe passage.\"\n\nProbability Assessment:\n\nGiven the factors at play - your party's demonstrated competence, good sailing season, well-traveled route, proper security measures, and adequate funding for quality passage - I assess this journey as Likely to succeed.\n\nHowever, there are real risks: Mediterranean piracy, the political situation (Alfonso V's agents, the Infantes' spies, possibly Granada's intelligence), the value of your cargo, and the inherent uncertainties of sea travel. A great success might mean arriving ahead of schedule with new opportunities. A failure could mean delays, incidents with authorities, or unwanted attention. A catastrophic failure could involve losing cargo, serious injury, or capture.\n\nPlease roll your dice and tell me the result: Great Success, Success, Failure, or Catastrophic Failure."

          "text": "The Journey to Barcelona - August 10-19, 1430\n\nFlorence to Pisa (August 10-12)\n\nThe ride west from Florence proves uneventful but purposeful. Your party moves with the practiced efficiency of four months on the road together. The banner case is strapped securely to a pack horse, with García and Rodrigo flanking it constantly. Martín rides beside Diego, who carries the treasury documentation and letters of credit in a locked satchel.\n\nThe Tuscan countryside in late summer is beautiful - golden wheat fields already harvested, vineyards heavy with grapes, cypress trees lining the roads. You pass merchant caravans heading to Florence, and more than once you see travelers stop and stare when they recognize the white tabard you now wear. Word of your speech has spread quickly.\n\nOn the evening of August 11th, you camp near a monastery outside Pisa. The monks have already heard rumors of \"the King of Castile who raised God's banner in Florence.\" The prior offers you lodging, but Captain Fernán politely insists your party camp outside - he doesn't want the relics or treasury within walls where he can't control access.\n\nYou reach Pisa midday on August 12th.\n\nHiring Passage in Pisa (August 12-13)\n\nPisa's harbor bustles with activity - merchant galleys loading spices and silks, fishing boats unloading their catch, shipwrights working on repairs. The smell of salt water, fish, and tar fills the air.\n\nCaptain Fernán and Sir Thomas spend the afternoon surveying available ships while you lodge at a merchant's house arranged by Cosimo de' Medici's contacts. By evening, they return with a recommendation.\n\n\"The Sant'Angelo,\" Captain Fernán reports. \"Thirty-oar galley, Pisan-owned, captain named Luca Grimaldi. He's sailed to Barcelona dozens of times, knows the route, knows the pirates' usual hunting grounds. His crew looks disciplined. The ship is well-maintained.\"\n\n\"He wants 2,000 florins for the passage,\" Sir Thomas adds. \"That's high, but he's seen the banner case and the chest. He knows what we're carrying is valuable, and he's pricing in the risk of attracting attention.\"\n\nYou negotiate briefly with Captain Grimaldi yourself the next morning. He's a lean, weathered man of about fifty with calculating eyes. When you agree to his price, he nods with satisfaction.\n\n\"We depart with tomorrow's tide, Your Majesty. Four days to Barcelona if the winds favor us, five if they don't. My crew knows to keep their mouths shut about passengers' business. You'll have the aft cabin - it's cramped, but private.\"\n\nThe Sea Voyage (August 14-18)\n\nThe Sant'Angelo catches the morning tide on August 14th. The galley rows out of harbor, then raises its lateen sail as the wind picks up. The Mediterranean stretches blue and vast before you.\n\nDay One goes smoothly. Most of your party suffers mild seasickness (including yourself, though you try not to show it). Fray Hernando spends much of the day on deck, face pale but stoically praying. García and Rodrigo maintain their watch over the banner and relics despite obvious queasiness.\n\nBy evening, everyone has found their sea legs somewhat. Captain Grimaldi serves a simple but decent meal - salt fish, hard bread, wine. He mentions casually that two ships have altered course to shadow you at a distance.\n\n\"Probably just merchant vessels curious about who hired my fastest galley,\" he says. \"Or maybe someone's keeping an eye on you, Your Majesty. Either way, they're not close enough to matter.\"\n\nDay Two and Three pass with steady progress. The wind holds from the north, pushing you southwest toward the Balearic Islands. You spend time on deck, watching the coast of southern France slide by in the distance. Sir Thomas points out landmarks he recognizes from previous voyages.\n\nOn the third day, Captain Grimaldi subtly changes course, taking you farther from the Balearic Islands than the direct route would require. When Captain Fernán asks why, Grimaldi explains quietly: \"There's been corsair activity near Mallorca this summer. North African galleys. They'd love to catch a prize like what you're carrying. This route adds half a day but keeps us in safer waters.\"\n\nDay Four brings the only real tension of the voyage. Around midday, a sleek galley appears on the horizon, closing rapidly. It flies no flag you recognize - a plain dark sail, oars beating water at impressive speed.\n\nCaptain Grimaldi orders his crew to battle stations without apparent panic. His men move quickly, efficiently. Weapons appear on deck - crossbows, spears, a few swords.\n\n\"Probably nothing,\" Grimaldi says, though his hand rests on his dagger. \"But we prepare anyway.\"\n\nYour guards form up around the banner case and treasury chest. Captain Fernán has his sword half-drawn. García and Rodrigo look grim but ready.\n\nFor a tense half-hour, the strange galley closes to within a mile. You can see men on its deck, armed and watching. Then, as if reaching some decision, it alters course and breaks away, heading south toward the Balearic Islands at speed.\n\n\"Just curious,\" Grimaldi says, though he doesn't sound entirely convinced. \"Or they decided we looked too well-armed for easy prey. Either way, they're gone.\"\n\nThe rest of the day passes without incident, though everyone remains alert.\n\nDay Five (August 18th) brings Barcelona into view. The city rises from the coast - church spires, the cathedral's incomplete towers, the royal palace on Montjuïc hill, merchant houses crowding the harbor. The enormous Drassanes shipyards sprawl along the waterfront.\n\nAs the Sant'Angelo approaches the harbor, you see something noteworthy: a royal standard flying from the harbor fortress. Not Alfonso V's personal banner (he's still in Naples), but the official standard of the Crown of Aragon.\n\nCaptain Grimaldi points it out. \"They know you're coming, Your Majesty. That's a formal greeting - or a formal watch. Possibly both.\"\n\nArrival in Barcelona (August 18, Late Afternoon)\n\nThe Sant'Angelo docks at one of Barcelona's main piers. A small delegation waits on the quay - six men in the livery of the Crown of Aragon, led by a gray-haired official in fine but sober clothing.\n\nAs your party disembarks - carefully, with García and Rodrigo carrying the banner case and chest under heavy guard - the official steps forward and bows.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says in careful Castilian. \"I am Pere de Cardona, Royal Chamberlain of Barcelona. I welcome you to Barcelona on behalf of King Alfonso V of Aragon, Naples, and Sicily. His Majesty has been informed of your journey and wishes you to know that you are a guest of honor in his realm.\"\n\nHis tone is formally correct but his eyes assess everything - your party's size, the obvious security around the banner case and chest, your white garments.\n\n\"Lodgings have been prepared at the Palau Reial Menor, if you would accept the hospitality of the Crown. Or if you prefer, arrangements can be made elsewhere in the city.\"\n\nBehind him, you can see harbor activity continuing, but you notice people watching from various points around the docks. Some are probably just curious onlookers. Others may be reporting your arrival to various interested parties - Alfonso's court officials, the Infantes' agents, Granada's spies, merchant houses, church officials.\n\nBarcelona knows you've arrived with something important.\n\nYou have successfully reached Barcelona with all your cargo secure, your party intact, and reasonable time made (9 days total from Florence, including the day in Pisa). The banner, relics, and treasury are safe. However, you are now very much under observation in Alfonso V's own city.\n\nWhat do you do?"

The question is whether María would receive him in such informal circumstances, or whether protocol requires a more formal audience.\n\nI should probably have Pere de Cardona explain the logistics - they'd need to get word to María first, and she'd need to prepare. It might be more practical to secure the cargo first, THEN see her. Or perhaps she could come to where he's lodging at the Palau Reial Menor?\n\nLet me think about what's most realistic and what creates good story opportunities.\n\nPere de Cardona follows your glance to the banner case and nods with understanding.

Hateful/Hostile - She blames Juan (or Castile) for something serious\n2. Cold/Resentful - She feels abandoned or used by Castile/her family\n3. Distant/Cautious - She's politically careful, doesn't trust easily\n4. Cordial/Diplomatic - Professional family relations, neither warm nor cold\n5. Warm/Affectionate - She still feels sisterly bonds despite years apart\n6. Joyful/Enthusiastic - She's delighted to see her little brother and eager to help\n\nLet me flesh out reasons for each:\n\nPere de Cardona nods and immediately dispatches a young attendant who sprints off toward the royal palace at impressive speed.\n\n\"Her Majesty will be informed within minutes, Your Majesty. Now, if you'll follow me, we'll get you and your company settled.\"\n\nAs your party begins the walk through Barcelona's streets toward the palace - García and Rodrigo carrying the banner case, Martín guarding the treasury chest, the rest of your guards forming a protective cordon - I need to establish Queen María's disposition toward you.\n\nQueen María of Aragon's Disposition Scale\n\nRoll 1d6 and tell me the result. Here are the possibilities:\n\n1 - Hostile/Bitter: María deeply resents being used as a political pawn in the Castilian-Aragonese alliance. Fifteen years of marriage with no children, a husband who abandoned her for Italian adventures, caught between her birth family and adopted kingdom. She blames Castilian politics (and by extension, you and your advisors) for her unhappy position. She may see your visit as another manipulation.\n\n2 - Cold/Resentful: She feels abandoned by her Castilian family. You were only three when she married and left; you've barely corresponded over the years. She's heard the Infantes' version of events and is inclined to believe you're an unstable young king dominated by a low-born favorite. She'll receive you out of duty, but with little warmth.\n\n3 - Cautious/Guarded: María has learned to be politically careful after fifteen years as queen without her husband's presence. She's uncertain where you stand, what you want, and how your visit affects her delicate position managing Aragon in Alfonso's absence. She'll be correct but reserved until she understands your intentions.\n\n4 - Cordially Diplomatic: She maintains proper family relations and is genuinely curious about you (her little brother, now a king making waves across Christendom). She's heard conflicting reports about your actions and wants to form her own judgment. Professional warmth with potential for more.\n\n5 - Warm/Affectionate: Despite years apart, María remembers you as her baby brother. She's heard about your pilgrimage, your audience with the Pope, and sees echoes of genuine faith that moves her. She's lonely in Barcelona with Alfonso gone and welcomes family connection. She may offer real help.\n\n6 - Joyful/Protective: María is delighted and relieved to see you. She's been worried about reports of the Infantes maneuvering against you, sees you as the little brother who needs her guidance, and is thrilled you've come to her. She's eager to help, give advice, and reconnect. She may have information and resources to offer.\n\nPlease roll 1d6 and tell me the result."

María hasn't seen Juan since he was very young (he's 18 now, she left when he was about 3 years old - married around 1415). She would be about 33 years old now.\n\nI should make this a meaningful family moment while also acknowledging the political context.\n\nPere de Cardona leads your party through Barcelona's streets. The city is impressive - narrow medieval lanes opening into broader plazas, merchant houses with elaborate facades, the distinctive Catalan Gothic architecture everywhere. People stop to watch your procession pass, whispering and pointing at your white garments and the heavily guarded cases your men carry.\n\nThe Palau Reial Menor sits adjacent to the great cathedral, a handsome stone building with arched windows and a small courtyard. Palace guards snap to attention as you arrive, and servants quickly appear to assist with your lodging.\n\nYour chambers are on the second floor - a suite of three rooms that are comfortable if not palatial. Captain Fernán immediately takes charge of security, positioning García and Rodrigo in the main room with the banner case and reliquary chest. Martín stands watch over the treasury documents. The other guards check windows and doors.\n\n\"We're as secure as we can be, Your Majesty,\" Captain Fernán reports. \"No one enters these rooms without going through your guards first.\"\n\nYou have perhaps twenty minutes to settle in, wash the salt from your face and hands, before there's a commotion in the corridor outside. Not hostile - excited. A woman's voice, speaking rapid Catalan to the guards, then switching to Castilian: \"Let me through - he's my brother!\"\n\nThe door opens, and Queen María of Aragon enters.\n\nShe's thirty-three now, though she looks younger - dark hair pulled back under a modest veil, warm brown eyes very like your own, a face that shows both Spanish and Trastámara heritage. She wears a fine but relatively simple gown in deep blue, as if she hadn't bothered to change into full court dress.\n\nFor a moment she just stares at you from the doorway. Her hand goes to her mouth.\n\n\"Dios mío,\" she whispers. \"You look so much like father. The same eyes, the same...\" She trails off, and then suddenly she's crossing the room quickly, propriety forgotten.\n\nShe embraces you tightly - and you realize she's trembling slightly.\n\n\"Juan. My little brother. You were barely three years old when I left for Barcelona. I've seen you perhaps twice since then - always formal audiences, always surrounded by courtiers and advisors. And now you're here, and you're...\" She steps back, still holding your shoulders, looking at you with glistening eyes. \"You're a man. A king. Wearing white like a knight from the old romances.\"\n\nShe glances around the room, taking in your companions, the guarded cases, then back to you.\n\n\"I've heard such stories. Your pilgrimage. Rome. Something extraordinary with Pope Martin. The speech in Florence that has all of Italy talking. Half of Christendom says you're blessed by God.

She's been isolated in Barcelona, lonely with Alfonso gone, and genuinely wants to connect with her brother. She'll be curious, supportive, but also concerned - she's heard conflicting reports and wants to understand what's really happening.\n\nI should have her respond with warmth but also with the practical concern of someone who's been navigating difficult political waters for fifteen years. She'll want to know more, she'll be excited but also worried for him. She might also have useful information or perspective to share about Alfonso, the Infantes, the political situation.\n\nThis is a family moment but also a politically significant one - she's Queen of Aragon, even if her husband is absent and she has no children to secure her position.\n\nMaría's expression softens even further at your words, though concern flickers in her eyes. She guides you to sit, gesturing for wine to be brought. Once the servants have poured and withdrawn, she sits close beside you - not in a throne room, but like family.\n\n\"Changed a lot,\" she repeats softly, studying your face. \"Yes, I can see that. There's something in your eyes - a weight that wasn't there before. Or perhaps I simply never saw you long enough to notice.\"\n\nShe takes your hand in both of hers.\n\n\"The Reconquista. A crusade bull from Pope Martin himself.\" She shakes her head in wonder. \"Juan, do you understand how extraordinary that is? How dangerous? You're eighteen years old, and you're taking on something that's defeated kings for centuries.\"\n\nBut there's no criticism in her tone - only concern mixed with something like pride.\n\n\"Tell me more. How did this happen? When I heard you'd gone on pilgrimage, I thought...\" She pauses, choosing words carefully. \"Juan and Enrique wrote that you'd abandoned the realm for mystical wanderings, that Álvaro de Luna was ruling in your name while you chased visions. But then word came from Rome - something about an audience with the Pope, something remarkable. And now you appear in Barcelona carrying...\"\n\nShe glances at the guarded cases. \"What are you carrying, hermano? Why such careful protection?\"\n\nShe leans closer, her voice dropping.\n\n\"And more importantly - are you safe? Juan de Aragón is my husband's brother, and I know him well enough to know he doesn't accept challenges to his authority gracefully. Whatever happened between you and him, it's made enemies. I need to know if you're in danger.\"\n\nThere's genuine worry in her voice now.\n\n\"Tell me everything. Please. I've been so isolated here - Alfonso in Naples chasing his Italian dreams, no children to give me real purpose, caught between my birth family and the family I married into. You're the first real connection to home I've had in years.\"\n\nHow much do you tell her? What do you want to know from her?"

          "text": "Juan is telling María everything, but he's leaving out the fact that he planned to return before he left - making it sound more like divine guidance or spontaneous inspiration rather than calculated political maneuver. This is interesting because it's consistent with how he's presented himself publicly, but it's also a form of deception to his sister.\n\nI should have María respond warmly to the story, showing she's moved by it, but also perhaps probe a bit - she's been in court politics for 15 years, she might sense there's more calculation than Juan is admitting, or she might just accept the narrative at face value because she wants to believe in her brother.\n\nLet me narrate her reactions as he tells the story, showing her emotional responses, and then have her respond with questions, concerns, and perhaps offers of help.\n\nYou tell her everything. The pilgrimage to Santiago, how you felt moved to return for your father's sword, arriving at the palace just in time to hear the Infantes plotting to make the regency permanent. María's eyes widen at this, her hand tightening on yours.\n\n\"They said that? In your own council chamber?\" She looks genuinely shocked.\n\nYou continue - the confrontation, removing Juan de Aragón from the council, the journey through France gathering letters of recommendation. When you describe the audience with Pope Martin V, María leans forward, completely absorbed.\n\nAs you tell her about stripping yourself naked before the Pope, offering everything you had, her free hand goes to her mouth. Tears begin sliding down her cheeks.\n\n\"Dios mío, Juan,\" she whispers. \"You truly did that? Offered everything?\"\n\nYou describe the Pope's reaction, his tears, the blessing, the crusade bull. The fragment of the True Cross and Saint James's bone. The twenty thousand florins. The speech in Florence that raised over sixty thousand more.\n\nWhen you finish, María sits in silence for a long moment, tears still on her face. Then she stands, walks to the window, and stares out over Barcelona for several heartbeats before turning back to you.\n\n\"I believe you,\" she says quietly. \"I believe every word. Because no one could invent something like that - it's too strange, too audacious. And because...\" She returns to sit beside you. \"Because I can see it in you, hermano. Something has changed. You're not the uncertain boy-king the Infantes described in their letters. You're something else now.\"\n\nShe wipes her eyes, then her expression grows more serious.\n\n\"But Juan, you must understand what you're walking into. The Infantes - both of them, and Alfonso too - they don't see what I see. They see a threat. A young king who's bypassed their authority, who's received papal blessing they didn't approve, who's raising armies and funds outside their control.\"\n\nShe leans closer, her voice urgent.\n\n\"Juan de Aragón - my husband's brother, the one you removed from your council - he's been in Barcelona. Just last month. He met with Alfonso's advisors here, wrote letters to Naples. He's building his case that you're unstable, unreliable, that Castile needs 'experienced governance.' And now you appear here, in Alfonso's own city, carrying papal relics and crusade funds...\"\n\nShe pauses, searching your face.\n\n\"What do you need from me, Juan? Why did you come to Barcelona? Just to pass through on your way to Seville? Or did you hope to...\" She gestures around. \"To make a statement? To show Alfonso that you have the Pope's backing and won't be intimidated?\"\n\nHer tone isn't critical - she's trying to understand your strategy.\n\n\"Because if you're here to make a statement, I can help with that. I manage Alfonso's court in his absence. I can arrange for you to speak before the Catalan nobility, to display your relics in the cathedral, to make it clear that Rome has blessed your cause. But if you do that, you're declaring openly that you don't fear the Infantes or Alfonso's displeasure. It will force him to take a position - support you or support his brothers.\"\n\nShe takes both your hands again.\n\n\"So tell me, hermano - what do you need? And how can I help you?\"\n\nWhat do you say? What do you want from your time in Barcelona?"

          "text": "In reality, Alfonso V was indeed focused on his Italian ambitions and spent much time away from Aragon. When he was absent, governance typically fell to:\n1. A Lieutenant General (often his wife or brother)\n2. The Corts (Cortes) - the Aragonese/Catalan parliament which was quite powerful\n3. Various royal councils and officials\n4. The Diputació del General (Generalitat) in Catalonia\n\nMaría of Castile (Juan's sister) was Alfonso's wife, but historically they had no children and the marriage was somewhat distant. Alfonso would later have his brother Juan (one of the Infantes) serve as Lieutenant, but in 1430 that arrangement might not be fully established yet.\n\nGiven the story context:\n- Alfonso is in Naples pursuing his Italian ambitions\n- The Infantes (Juan and Enrique) have been causing trouble in Castile\n- María seems somewhat isolated and without real power (\"no children to give me real purpose\")\n\nI should present a realistic picture where María has some ceremonial/social authority as queen, but real governing power is distributed among:\n1. A regency council or Lieutenant General\n2. The Aragonese nobility and Corts\n3. Royal officials\n4. Possibly one of the Infantes has some formal role\n\nThis is important because it will determine how much María can actually help Juan, and who else he needs to deal with in Barcelona.\n\nMaría's expression shifts slightly - a flicker of something that might be resignation or perhaps bitterness, quickly masked.\n\n\"Ah. You ask the real question.\" She stands and paces to the window again, her back to you for a moment.\n\n\"I manage the court,\" she says carefully. \"I receive ambassadors, I host ceremonies, I represent the crown at religious festivals. I am the visible face of royal authority in Barcelona.\" She turns back to face you. \"But I do not rule, hermano.\"\n\nShe returns to sit, her voice matter-of-fact now, as if stating facts she's long since accepted.\n\n\"Alfonso appointed a council before he left for Naples - the Consell Reial. It's led by the Archbishop of Zaragoza and includes several major nobles. They handle day-to-day governance, judicial matters, military decisions. They consult me on certain matters, particularly those involving other kingdoms or the Church. But they don't require my approval.\"\n\nShe pauses, then adds more quietly:\n\n\"And then there's the Corts - the Aragonese parliament. The nobility, the Church, the cities. They guard their privileges jealously and Alfonso must negotiate with them for any significant funds or laws. They meet irregularly, but they're the real power here. Far more than I am.\"\n\nA slight smile, tinged with irony.\n\n\"A queen without children has limited authority, Juan. I can open doors for you, arrange audiences, whisper in the right ears. The Archbishop respects me. Several noble houses owe me favors. The common people love me because I'm visible and generous with charity. But I cannot command armies or commit Aragon to alliances. I cannot override the Consell if they decide something.\"\n\nShe leans forward.\n\n\"However - and this is important - Juan de Aragón has no official authority here either. He's King of Navarre, yes, but that's a separate crown. In Aragon, he's simply the king's brother, nothing more. He can write letters and scheme, but he cannot command the Consell or the Corts.\"\n\nHer expression grows more calculating.\n\n\"What I can do is shape perceptions. If you display your papal relics in the cathedral with my blessing, it carries weight. If I host you at the royal palace, introduce you to the right people, speak of you warmly to the Archbishop and the great houses - that matters. Not because I have formal power, but because I represent continuity, legitimacy, the crown's presence.\"\n\nShe meets your eyes directly.\n\n\"And I can tell you who matters here. Who to speak with, who to avoid, who might be reporting to Juan de Aragón, who might be open to supporting your crusade. That information could be valuable.\"\n\nShe pauses, then asks more softly:\n\n\"Why do you ask, hermano? Are you concerned about how much I can actually help? Or are you trying to understand the political landscape before you make your next move?\"\n\nWhat do you say?"

The pope has written the king of Aragon to aid me in the crusade. What should I do sister? Can I adress of meet the council or parliament of Aragon and ask for help?

          "text": "Juan is asking practical questions about how to operate in Aragon - can he address the council or parliament, gain support against Navarre (which is ruled by Infante Juan), etc.\n\nMaría would have good advice here. She's been navigating Aragonese politics for 15 years. She would understand:\n1. The Consell Reial (royal council) - probably needs her introduction but possible\n2. The Corts (parliament) - much more formal, harder to convene, but powerful\n3. The Archbishop and church hierarchy - probably the most accessible and influential\n4. Individual noble houses - can be approached separately\n5. Public displays (cathedral, etc.) - easier to arrange and impactful\n\nShe'd also know:\n- Alfonso's letter from the Pope exists but hasn't arrived yet, or has arrived but Alfonso hasn't responded\n- The Consell would be cautious about committing to anything without Alfonso's explicit approval\n- The Corts would need to be formally convened - can't just be called\n- But there are other ways to build support and make statements\n\nShe'd probably advise a multi-pronged approach that doesn't require official governmental approval but builds momentum and makes it harder for the Infantes to oppose him.\n\nMaría's expression softens completely at your words. She reaches out and cups your face with one hand, her eyes wet again.\n\n\"Thank you for saying that, hermano. You don't know how much I needed to hear it. Fifteen years here, and sometimes I feel more like a diplomatic artifact than a person - displayed when useful, stored away when not.\" She wipes her eyes quickly. \"But yes. Sister first. Always.\"\n\nShe takes a deep breath, visibly shifting into more practical mode while still maintaining that warmth.\n\n\"Now, to your questions. The Pope has written to Alfonso?\" She considers. \"That letter may not have reached Naples yet, or Alfonso may be deliberately slow in responding - his Italian campaign consumes him entirely. But the fact that it exists is powerful.\"\n\nShe stands and begins pacing, thinking aloud.\n\n\"The Consell Reial - I could arrange for you to meet with them. The Archbishop of Zaragoza is the key figure, and he's actually in Barcelona right now. He's devout, politically cautious, but he respects papal authority deeply. If you showed him the crusade bull, the relics, told him about Rome...\" She nods to herself. \"Yes, he would listen. And if he supports you, others on the council would follow his lead.\"\n\nShe turns back to you.\n\n\"But the Corts - the parliament - that's more complicated. They meet only when formally convened by the king or in genuine emergency. I cannot summon them, and they wouldn't appreciate being called for what they might see as Castilian business. However...\" Her eyes light up. \"Individual representatives can be approached. The great houses, the city councils, the Church hierarchy. You don't need the Corts as an institution if you can win over its key members individually.\"\n\nShe sits back down beside you, speaking more urgently now.\n\n\"Here's what I think you should do. A multi-part approach over the next week or two:\n\nFirst, display the relics publicly in Barcelona Cathedral. I can arrange this easily - the Bishop is a friend. Let the people see what you carry. Let them witness the fragment of the True Cross and Saint James's bone. This creates religious fervor and makes your crusade real to them. After Florence, you know how powerful this can be.\n\nSecond, I'll arrange a private dinner with Archbishop of Zaragoza and select members of the Consell. Intimate, not formal. You tell your story, show them the papal bull, answer their concerns. They need to see you're not the unstable mystic the Infantes describe.\n\nThird, audiences with key noble houses. The Counts of Urgell, the Cardona family, perhaps the Montcadas. These are the power brokers in Catalonia. Some will be cautious, but if even a few commit support - funds, troops, political backing - it strengthens your position enormously.\n\nFourth...\" She pauses, choosing words carefully. \"You should write to Alfonso directly. Tell him about Rome, about the Pope's blessing, about the crusade. Be respectful - he is king, he is my husband, and he has the power to either help or hinder you significantly. But be clear that you're proceeding with papal authority whether or not he joins. Show strength, not pleading.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hand.\n\n\"As for Navarre - Infante Juan's kingdom - that's more dangerous. Navarre is small but strategically positioned between Castile and Aragon. If Juan actively opposes you, he could disrupt communications, harbor your enemies, even threaten your border. But if you gain enough support here in Aragon, and if Alfonso at least stays neutral, then Juan becomes isolated. He can write letters and scheme, but he can't wage war alone.\"\n\nShe leans back, studying your face.\n\n\"This would take perhaps two weeks, maybe three. You'd remain in Barcelona as my honored guest. I'd introduce you to the right people, arrange the right meetings, help you navigate Catalan politics.\" She smiles slightly. \"And we'd have time together as brother and sister, not just king and queen. I'd like that.\"\n\nThen her expression grows more serious.\n\n\"But Juan, you must understand - this commits you to staying here longer. Every day you remain in Alfonso's city without his explicit permission is a statement. You're saying you don't need his approval. That could anger him, or it could force him to respect you. I don't know which. And the Infantes will hear of everything you do here. They'll be preparing their response.\"\n\nShe searches your eyes.\n\n\"Is that the kind of statement you want to make? Are you willing to take that time? Because the Royal Council in Seville is in November, yes? You'd still have time to reach Seville by late September or early October if you left Barcelona in early September. But you'd be cutting it close.\"\n\nWhat do you want to do? Stay in Barcelona for 2-3 weeks following María's plan? Shorten it somehow? Take a different approach?"

Correspondence with Castilian nobles or church officials\n4. Merchants and travelers bringing news\n\nShe would likely have a more objective view than the Infantes themselves, but might not know every detail. She'd probably know:\n- That something happened (the Infantes tried to consolidate power)\n- That it didn't go well for them\n- That news from Rome changed everything\n- General outlines but not all specifics\n\nI should have her share what she knows, which would give Juan valuable intelligence about how his kingdom fared in his absence.\n\nMaría's expression grows more guarded. She glances toward the door, then lowers her voice slightly.\n\n\"I've heard things. Through letters, through Alfonso's intelligence network, through merchants and travelers.\" She pauses. \"The Infantes have been... active during your absence.\"\n\nShe stands and moves to a small writing desk, pulling out several letters.\n\n\"Juan de Aragón wrote to me three times over the summer. The letters were carefully worded, but the message was clear - he was attempting to rally Castilian nobles against what he called 'Álvaro de Luna's tyranny' and your 'abandonment of the realm for mystical pursuits.'\" She sets down the letters. \"He tried to make it sound like he was protecting your interests while you were away. But I could read between the lines.\"\n\nShe returns to sit beside you.\n\n\"From what I've pieced together from various sources: In June and July, Juan called an assembly at Burgos. He was hoping for a strong showing of noble support - perhaps thirty or forty major houses. He got twenty-three. Most nobles sent polite refusals or simply didn't respond.\"\n\nShe taps her fingers thoughtfully.\n\n\"Then he tried something more direct. Military action. He seized Arévalo fortress - that much I know for certain because he wrote Alfonso asking for tacit approval after the fact. He also took at least two smaller castles in the north. But...\" She meets your eyes. \"He failed to take any major cities. Segovia refused him entry outright. I heard that from a merchant who was there - the city leaders told Juan's men that 'Segovia serves the king, not princes of Aragon.'\"\n\nA slight smile crosses her face.\n\n\"And then, in mid-August, everything changed. Word reached Castile that you'd been to Rome. That you'd met with Pope Martin. That something extraordinary had happened.\" She leans forward. \"I don't know exactly when the news arrived, but Juan's next letter to me was very different in tone. Defensive. Making excuses. Saying he'd only been trying to maintain order until your return.\"\n\nShe pauses, then adds more quietly:\n\n\"From what I can gather, whatever coalition he was trying to build... it collapsed. Nobles who had been cautiously interested suddenly wanted nothing to do with open opposition to a king who had papal backing. Juan retreated to his estates. Enrique apparently remained on your regency council - I heard that from the Archbishop of Zaragoza, who has contacts in Toledo.\"\n\nShe searches your face.\n\n\"As for Álvaro de Luna - he seems to have held firm. I've heard no reports of him being removed or fleeing or losing control of the administration. The major cities remained loyal. Your advisors - that cabinet you mentioned forming - apparently functioned well.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hand.\n\n\"In short, hermano, your kingdom survived your absence better than the Infantes hoped. They tried to exploit your pilgrimage, but they couldn't build enough support fast enough. And when news of Rome arrived, they lost their momentum entirely.\"\n\nHer expression grows more serious.\n\n\"But that makes them more dangerous, not less. They've been humiliated. They've exposed themselves as rebels without having succeeded. Wounded animals are unpredictable. By the time you reach Seville for your Royal Council in November, they'll have had months to prepare their response.\"\n\nShe tilts her head thoughtfully.\n\n\"There is one other thing. I've heard rumors - just rumors, mind you - that Granada has been... unusually active diplomatically this summer. Merchants report unusual traffic in and out of Granada's ports. Something about embassies sent to Morocco, Egypt, perhaps even the Ottomans.\" She frowns. \"I don't know if that's true, or if it's just the sort of stories that circulate when people hear about a crusade being planned. But it's worth noting.\"\n\nShe looks at you directly.\n\n\"When was the last time you received correspondence from Álvaro? Do you know the current state of your realm beyond what I've just told you?\"\n\nWhat do you tell her? And what else do you want to ask?"

Alfonso's blood. If you order them arrested for treason, you're not just moving against rebellious nobles - you're moving against the royal family of Aragon. Do you understand what that means?\"\n\nShe's gripping your wrist tightly now, her eyes intense.\n\n\"Yes, they rebelled. Yes, they seized fortresses and tried to rally nobles against you. But they failed. They retreated. They're exposed and weakened. Right now, they're humiliated but not desperate.\" She takes a breath. \"If you try to arrest them - to put them on trial for treason - you give them no choice but total war. You corner them. And you force Alfonso to choose between his brothers and his sister's brother.\"\n\nShe releases your wrist and paces away, then turns back.\n\n\"And hermano - you're sitting in Barcelona. Alfonso's city. Under his roof. If you write from here ordering the arrest of his brothers...\" She shakes her head. \"It looks like you're using his hospitality to strike at his family. It poisons everything. It makes me look complicit. It makes Alfonso look weak for hosting you.\"\n\nHer voice drops even lower.\n\n\"And there's something else you need to know. Something I didn't want to burden you with immediately, but...\" She hesitates, then continues. \"Your correspondence with Álvaro. I've heard whispers - just whispers - from some of Alfonso's advisors that the Infantes may have people in the postal networks between here and Castile. They may be reading your letters. I don't know this for certain, but if it's true, and you write ordering their arrest...\"\n\nShe lets that hang in the air.\n\n\"They would know immediately. They would have time to prepare, to fortify their positions, to rally whatever support they still have. The element of surprise would be lost entirely.\"\n\nShe comes back to sit beside you, taking both your hands in hers, her expression pleading.\n\n\"Juan, I'm not saying you're wrong. They are traitors. They did rebel. But arresting royal princes is not something you do hastily from hundreds of miles away. It requires careful planning, overwhelming force, and absolute certainty of support.\"\n\nShe searches your face.\n\n\"At minimum, shouldn't you wait until you're back in Castile? Until you can coordinate with Álvaro directly, assess the true military situation, ensure you have the forces to actually execute such arrests? And shouldn't you at least wait until after the Royal Council in November - where you can confront them publicly with the papal bull, with all the nobles watching, and force them to submit or openly defy Rome itself?\"\n\nShe squeezes your hands.\n\n\"I know you're angry. I know you want to act. But please - think strategically, not emotionally. Don't give them the opening they need to turn this into a full civil war, and don't put me in an impossible position between my husband's family and my birth family.\"\n\nHer eyes are wet with tears now.\n\n\"Please, hermano.

Alvaro should put this in motion immediately and make my demand public knowledge as well. This message is too important to send by normal messenger, so I am sending you personally. I also dont want my sister involved when I am prosecuting her husband's brothers, so keep your mission secret. You are just travelling ahead to Alvaro to prepare for my arrival in November."

Fray Hernando - spiritual advisor, would likely have concerns about the moral/strategic implications\n3. María - would be relieved not to be involved but still worried about the consequences\n\nThis is also a major decision point. The player is committing to a confrontational approach with the Infantes rather than using the November council to pressure them. Let me have the characters respond realistically.\n\nCaptain Fernán would ask practical questions about:\n- Timeline (how long to reach Castile?)\n- Security (traveling alone or with guards?)\n- What if he's intercepted?\n- Does this mean the King stays in Barcelona without his most trusted commander?\n\nFray Hernando would have concerns about:\n- Justice vs. vengeance\n- Whether this serves the crusade or creates civil war\n- The timing and wisdom of the action\n\nMaría would be relieved but still worried.\n\nI should have them all react, raise their concerns, and let the player think through the implications.\n\nCaptain Fernán and Fray Hernando arrive within moments. Fernán's hand rests instinctively on his sword hilt as he enters - the urgency in your summons has put him on alert. Fray Hernando's expression is concerned, his eyes moving between you and María's tear-stained face.\n\nYou give your orders. Captain Fernán listens without interruption, his weathered face unreadable. When you finish, there's a moment of heavy silence.\n\nThen the Captain speaks, his voice carefully measured:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I will do as you command. Always.\" He pauses. \"But I need to understand what you're ordering clearly. You want me to ride to Castile - that's at least two weeks of hard travel, possibly three. I'm to deliver orders to Don Álvaro to publicly demand the Infantes surrender themselves for trial on charges of treason and rebellion.\"\n\nHe shifts his weight slightly.\n\n\"Some practical questions, if I may. First, I'll need a written order with your seal - Álvaro won't move on just my word, and he'll need documentation to show the nobility. Second, do I travel alone or with guards? Alone is faster and more discreet, but if the Infantes have agents watching the roads...\" He lets that hang.\n\n\"Third, and most important, Your Majesty - this leaves you here in Barcelona without your most experienced commander. You'll have Sergeant García, Rodrigo, and the others, but they're good men, not officers. You'd be in Alfonso's city, carrying the crusade relics and treasury, while I'm weeks away.\"\n\nFray Hernando steps forward, his expression deeply troubled.\n\n\"Your Majesty, may I speak?\" At your nod, he continues carefully. \"I understand your anger at the Infantes' rebellion. What they did was treasonous. But...\" He glances at María, then back to you. \"Is this justice or is this vengeance? And more practically - is this wise?\"\n\nHe clasps his hands together.\n\n\"You said in Florence that Christian virtue should guide your crusaders. One of those virtues is prudence - acting wisely, not rashly. Another is mercy toward those who might yet repent.\" He pauses. \"The Infantes rebelled and failed. They're humiliated and weakened. In November, you could confront them at the Royal Council with all the nobles watching, with the papal bull in hand, with the weight of Rome behind you. You could force them to bend the knee publicly or be condemned by everyone present.\"\n\nHis voice grows more urgent.\n\n\"But if you order their arrest now, from hundreds of miles away, you turn a failed rebellion into a desperate fight for survival. You give them no choice but total resistance. And you risk splitting Castile into armed camps right when you need unity for the crusade.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"I'm not saying they don't deserve punishment. I'm asking - is this the right moment? Is this the right method? Or are you acting from wounded pride rather than strategic calculation?\"\n\nMaría has been silent, but now she speaks quietly:\n\n\"I'm grateful you want to keep me out of it, hermano. Truly. But Fray Hernando is right - this could tear everything apart. And...\" She hesitates. \"If Captain Fernán leaves, and something happens to you here while he's gone, I would never forgive myself.\"\n\nAll three of them are watching you, waiting.\n\nWhat do you do? Do you proceed with sending Captain Fernán? Modify your orders? Reconsider entirely?"

If so, I may expand our company in Barcelona with a handful of crusaders, swelling our numbers enough to make up for those we have sent away.

But first, let me handle the immediate scene.\n\nCaptain Fernán exchanges a glance with Fray Hernando, then nods slowly.\n\n\"As you command, Your Majesty. I'll take three good riders - fast horses, light armor, able to fight if necessary but focused on speed. Two weeks to Valladolid if we push hard, less if fortune favors us.\"\n\nFray Hernando closes his eyes briefly, as if in prayer, then opens them.\n\n\"Then I will begin as you've asked.

One of your guards - Felipe - enters and bows.\n\n\"Your Majesty, there are visitors in the palace courtyard. Four men just arrived from the road - Italians by their look and speech. They're asking for the King of Castile. They say they heard your speech in Florence and have come to join the crusade.\"\n\nHe looks uncertain. \"Pere de Cardona's men are keeping them in the courtyard, but they seem... eager. Legitimate. One of them speaks some Castilian.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán's eyebrows rise slightly. \"Quick work. It's only been ten days since Florence. These must be men who dropped everything and rode hard.\"\n\nHe looks at you. \"Do you want to see them now? Or shall I assess them first while you draft your letter?\"\n\nWhat do you do?

Six men if you count Diego your secretary, though he's not really a fighter.\"\n\nHe rubs his jaw thoughtfully.\n\n\"As for who commands in my absence...\" He looks between you and the others. \"Sergeant García is the most experienced soldier - he's served longer than any of us, fought on the frontier, knows his business. But he's not an officer. Never has been. He takes orders well; giving them is different.\"\n\nHe turns slightly toward where you know Sir Thomas is lodging nearby.\n\n\"Sir Thomas Beaumont is a knight. He's led men in France, commanded small units in the field. He has the bearing, the experience of command. But...\" Fernán hesitates. \"He's foreign. English. The men respect him, but he's been with us less than three months. And frankly, Your Majesty, I don't know him as well as I know García and Rodrigo.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes directly.\n\n\"My recommendation? Make Rodrigo the acting captain. He's young for it - only twenty-six - but he's proven. Loyal beyond question. Smart enough to know when to ask advice. And the men already follow him naturally. García can serve as his sergeant, providing experience. Sir Thomas can serve as your military advisor - he has knowledge we lack, especially about fighting in pitched battles rather than frontier skirmishes.\"\n\nHe nods, as if confirming his own judgment.\n\n\"That gives you a proper command structure.

The relics themselves - gold and silver reliquaries, the actual fragments inside\n4. The emotional weight of the scene\n\nJuan is being very respectful, almost theatrical in his reverence. He's touched them once and vows never again. This is consistent with his character development - the mix of genuine piety and awareness of symbolism.\n\nMaría should be deeply moved by this. It's not just the relics themselves, but her brother trusting her with this, the intimacy of the moment, the weight of what he's undertaking.\n\nThe guards would grant permission - Juan is their king, and this is his sister. But they'd do it solemnly, maintaining the gravity.\n\nGarcía and Rodrigo exchange a brief glance. Then García, the older sergeant, straightens and speaks with unexpected formality:\n\n\"Your Majesty has entrusted us with this sacred charge. The relics are under the King's authority, and through him, the Holy See's.\" He bows his head slightly. \"If His Majesty wishes the Queen to see them, then it is permitted.\"\n\nRodrigo adds quietly, \"It would be an honor to show Her Majesty what we guard.\"\n\nThey move to the reliquary chest. Rodrigo produces the key from around his neck, unlocks it, and carefully lifts the lid.\n\nInside, nestled in velvet padding, rest two reliquaries:\n\nThe gold reliquary - perhaps eight inches tall, ornately worked with religious scenes, set with small gems. Through a crystal window in the front, you can see it: a small fragment of dark wood, no longer than a man's thumb, mounted in a cross of gold wire.\n\nThe silver reliquary - slightly smaller, more austere in design but beautifully crafted. Through its crystal face: a single finger bone, yellowed with age, resting on white silk.\n\nMaría's hands fly to her mouth. She takes a step forward, then stops, as if afraid to get too close. Your hands rest on her shoulders, steadying her.\n\n\"Dios mío,\" she whispers. \"That's... that's truly...\"\n\nShe can't finish the sentence. Tears begin streaming down her face.\n\nRodrigo carefully lifts the gold reliquary from its velvet nest and holds it at chest height, allowing María to see it clearly. The afternoon light through the window catches the gold, making it seem to glow.\n\nMaría slowly sinks to her knees, her hands still at her mouth, sobbing quietly. She stares at the dark fragment of wood through her tears.\n\n\"The True Cross,\" she whispers. \"The cross where Our Lord died for our sins. Juan... you're carrying this?\"\n\nShe looks up at you, then back at the reliquary, then back to you. Her face shows wonder, fear, joy, and something like awe all at once.\n\n\"No wonder...\" she says through her tears. \"No wonder the Pope blessed you. No wonder Florence erupted. If you march with this...\" She shakes her head, unable to articulate it.\n\nGarcía gently lifts the silver reliquary. \"And the blessed Saint James, Your Majesty. Santiago himself, patron of Spain, who brings victory to Christian armies.\"\n\nMaría makes the sign of the cross, her hands trembling. She leans closer to the gold reliquary, close enough that her breath might fog the crystal if she weren't holding it carefully.\n\n\"May I...\" she whispers to the guards, not to you. \"May I pray before it? Just for a moment?\"\n\nRodrigo glances at you for confirmation, then nods. He kneels, holding the reliquary steady at a height where María can see it clearly while she prays.\n\nYour sister closes her eyes, clasps her hands, and begins to pray in Latin. Her voice is barely audible, but you catch fragments: \"...Domine Jesu Christe... qui pro nobis in cruce...\" (Lord Jesus Christ... who for us on the cross...)\n\nShe prays for perhaps two minutes - it feels both very long and very brief. When she finishes, she opens her eyes, looks at the reliquary one more time with something like desperate love, then makes the sign of the cross again and rises shakily to her feet.\n\nShe turns to you, and suddenly embraces you tightly, burying her face in your shoulder. You can feel her shaking.\n\n\"I understand now,\" she says into your shoulder. \"I understand everything. Why you're so certain. Why you feel called. Juan, you're carrying the cross itself. How could you fail with that blessing you?\"\n\nShe pulls back, wiping her face with her hands, not caring about the tears or her appearance.\n\n\"Yes,\" she says firmly. \"Yes, we'll display them in the cathedral. All of Barcelona needs to see this. All of Catalonia. Let them see what you carry. Let them understand that this isn't politics or ambition - this is holy.\"\n\nShe looks back at the reliquaries as García and Rodrigo carefully return them to their velvet nest and close the chest.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she says to the guards. \"For showing me. For guarding them so faithfully.\" Then to you: \"And thank you, hermano. For trusting me with this. For letting me see...\"\n\nShe can't finish. She just embraces you again.\n\nAfter a long moment, she composes herself and steps back.\n\n\"I'll arrange everything. The cathedral display, the meetings with the Archbishop and the Consell. They need to see this. They need to understand.\" She wipes her eyes once more. \"But first... you should write that letter to Álvaro. And I should let you work.\"\n\nShe moves toward the door, then pauses and looks back.\n\n\"God is with you, Juan. I felt it in that room just now. Whatever happens with the Infantes, whatever challenges come - God is with you.\"\n\nShe departs, leaving you with Fray Hernando at the writing desk, ready to draft your letter to Álvaro de Luna.\n\nWhat do you want the letter to say?"

But Juan is being honest - he genuinely feels the same certainty. The question is whether that certainty is divine guidance, strategic intuition, or dangerous overconfidence.\n\nI think Fray Hernando would:\n1. Appreciate Juan's honesty\n2. Still be deeply troubled\n3. Point out that even if Juan doesn't claim divine intervention, others will read it that way\n4. Ultimately defer to Juan's authority as king while maintaining his spiritual concern\n5. Perhaps suggest a small modification that keeps the truth but is less likely to be misinterpreted\n\nThis is good character development - Juan is increasingly comfortable with his certainty, while Fray Hernando grows increasingly worried about it.

And I appreciate your honesty - that you're not claiming divine intervention, just this... certainty you feel.\" He pauses. \"But Your Majesty, here's what troubles me: you may not be claiming it's holy intervention, but when you compare this decision to your journey to Rome - which was blessed by God, which did result in extraordinary grace - others will make that connection for you.\"\n\nHe gestures to the letter.\n\n\"Álvaro will read this and think: 'My king felt this same clarity before Rome, and God validated that choice beyond all expectation. Therefore, this must also be God's will.' The nobles who hear about it will think the same. You're not explicitly claiming divine guidance, but you're creating the association in their minds.\"\n\nHe leans forward slightly.\n\n\"And that's dangerous, Juan. Because if this decision leads to civil war, if it ends badly, then people will say either that you were wrong about God's guidance - which damages your authority - or that God's will includes the bloodshed of civil war - which makes God seem capricious and cruel.\"\n\nHe picks up the quill again.\n\n\"May I suggest a small change? Keep the truth, but frame it differently. Perhaps: 'I am as certain of this decision as I have been of any I've made since beginning my personal rule' or 'I have considered this carefully and am resolved.' That communicates your certainty without creating the comparison to Rome.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly, his expression both respectful and concerned.\n\n\"You are my king, and I will write whatever you command. But as your spiritual advisor, I'm asking you to consider: is your certainty about this action truly the same as what you felt before Rome? Or does it just feel similar because you're confident in your judgment?\"\n\nHe sets down the quill.\n\n\"Because one was a leap of faith into the unknown, surrendering everything to God. The other is a calculated political move to punish rebels. Both might be correct decisions, but they're not the same kind of decision. And I worry that treating them as equivalent blurs the line between divine calling and human strategy.\"\n\nHe waits, watching your face.\n\n\"What would you like me to write, Your Majesty?\"\n\nWhat do you decide? Keep the original phrasing, accept Fray Hernando's suggested modification, or propose something else?"

He nods slowly.\n\n\"Thank you, Your Majesty. For listening. For trusting me with this.\" He pauses, then adds more quietly, \"And I hear what you're saying - that you truly feel the same certainty.

If civil war comes, it won't be you alone who suffers.\"\n\nHe presses the seal into the hot wax, leaving the royal insignia clear and sharp.\n\n\"I'm not saying that makes the decision wrong. Kings must sometimes risk their subjects' lives for the greater good. I'm only saying... the weight of certainty should perhaps be heavier when the cost falls on others rather than yourself.\"\n\nHe lifts the seal carefully, checking that the impression is clean, then sets the letter aside to let the wax harden fully.\n\n\"It's done. Captain Fernán can carry this to Don Álvaro with confidence.\"\n\nHe stands and moves to the window, looking out over Barcelona.\n\n\"What happens now, Your Majesty? We wait for the Italian crusaders to be assessed? You meet with the Archbishop? Begin planning the cathedral display?\"\n\nThere's a knock at the door. One of your guards - García - enters and bows.\n\n\"Your Majesty, Captain Fernán reports that the four Italians are ready in the courtyard. He's had them show their skills with weapons. He says they're competent - not professional soldiers, but not fools either. They can ride, fight, and follow orders. He recommends you speak with them before making final decision.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"And Sir Thomas Beaumont asks to speak with you when convenient. He says Captain Fernán informed him he'll be serving as military advisor while the Captain is away, and he wants to understand your expectations.\"\n\nWhat do you want to do first? Meet the Italian crusaders? Speak with Sir Thomas? Something else?"

That shows real commitment.\n\nI'll make them diverse but believable - maybe different social classes, different reasons for coming, different skills. Not all perfect - some flawed but sincere.\n\nYou gather Fray Hernando and send for Sir Thomas, then descend to the palace courtyard. The afternoon sun slants across the cobblestones, casting long shadows from the surrounding buildings.\n\nCaptain Fernán stands with four men near the stables. They've clearly been put through their paces - they're sweating, breathing hard, and their horses show signs of recent hard riding. Several practice weapons lean against the stable wall.\n\nThe four men straighten as you approach, then bow - some more gracefully than others.\n\nCaptain Fernán steps forward. \"Your Majesty. These are the men who've come from Florence.\" He gestures to each in turn.\n\nThe first is perhaps thirty years old, lean and weather-beaten with a soldier's bearing. He wears plain traveling clothes but carries himself with professional competence. \"This is Marco Tornesi. Says he fought as a mercenary for Milan, then Genoa. Knows his way around a sword. Good rider. Speaks some Castilian - better than the others.\"\n\nMarco bows again, deeper this time. \"Your Majesty,\" he says in accented but understandable Castilian. \"I hear your speech in Florence. I see the banner. I...\" He searches for words. \"I fight for money many years. Always for money. When I see you, I think... maybe I fight for something else, yes? For God, for Christ. Before I am too old, before my soul is...\" He gestures vaguely, unable to find the word.\n\nThe second man is younger - mid-twenties - well-dressed in merchant's clothing that's now dusty from the road. He has soft hands but eager eyes. Captain Fernán continues: \"Pietro Aldobrandini. Wool merchant's son from Florence. Never fought in battle but he's been training. He's clumsy with a sword but enthusiastic. Can ride well enough. Has his own horse and funds to sustain himself.\"\n\nPietro bows energetically, speaking rapid Italian that you don't fully understand, though you catch words like \"Dio\" (God), \"croce\" (cross), and \"Granada.\"\n\nSir Thomas, standing beside you, murmurs quietly in your ear: \"The merchant's boy will need serious training before he's useful in combat. But that type can be surprisingly resilient if they survive the first real fight. The mercenary knows his business - you can see it in how he stands, how his eyes assess everything.\"\n\nThe third is older - perhaps forty-five - with graying hair and a limp. He's stocky, strong-looking despite the limp. \"Giovanni Rossi,\" Captain Fernán says. \"Former blacksmith from near Pisa. Lost three fingers on his left hand in an accident years ago. Says he can still fight right-handed and wants to serve God before he dies. The limp is from an old cart accident - won't slow him on horseback much.\"\n\nGiovanni bows stiffly. He speaks no Castilian, only Italian, but his eyes are fierce and determined. He pulls out a rosary from his shirt and kisses it, then points at you and makes the sign of the cross.\n\nThe fourth is the youngest - barely twenty - tall and gangly with the awkwardness of youth not yet grown into his frame. \"Andrea Vescovi,\" Captain Fernán says with slight skepticism. \"Farmer's son from countryside near Florence. Says his father died last year, his mother's remarried, and he has nothing to keep him home. Knows horses from farm work. Can't really fight yet but he's strong and willing to learn.\"\n\nThe young man - Andrea - looks nervous but determined. He clutches his cap in his hands, twisting it anxiously as he bows.\n\nCaptain Fernán crosses his arms. \"Marco the mercenary is the only real soldier among them. Pietro the merchant might become useful. Giovanni the blacksmith has the spirit but he's old and injured. Andrea the farm boy is raw material - could be shaped into something or could get himself killed in the first week.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"They're not professional soldiers, Your Majesty. But they rode hard from Florence - ten days of brutal riding to catch you here. That shows commitment at least. Marco could help train the others if you give him that role. They could fill out your company's numbers while I'm away.\"\n\nSir Thomas adds his perspective: \"I've seen worse in English levies. At least they came voluntarily and they have some basic skills. With proper training and discipline...\" He shrugs. \"They might serve adequately. The key is whether they'll hold when it gets bloody.\"\n\nFray Hernando has been watching them all quietly. Now he steps forward and addresses them in Latin, which Marco and Pietro seem to understand somewhat, while Giovanni and Andrea look confused.\n\nHe switches to Italian, speaking slowly. You catch enough to understand he's asking them about their faith, their reasons for coming, whether they understand this is a holy crusade requiring spiritual discipline as well as martial courage.\n\nMarco responds in Italian, gesturing emphatically. Pietro nods eagerly, pulling out his own rosary. Giovanni just keeps making the sign of the cross and pointing upward. Andrea stammers something that sounds like a sincere if simple declaration of faith.\n\nFray Hernando turns to you and speaks quietly in Castilian so only you, Captain Fernán, and Sir Thomas can hear:\n\n\"They're sincere. Not perfectly holy - Marco has done things as a mercenary he's ashamed of, Pietro has the enthusiasm of youth but shallow understanding, Giovanni is simple but genuinely devout, Andrea barely comprehends what he's committing to. But...\" He pauses. \"They're not cynics. They're not just seeking adventure or plunder. Something in your speech moved them enough to drop their lives and ride for ten days. That counts for something.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"If you accept them, I'll need to begin their spiritual formation immediately. Confession, instruction, helping them understand what it means to be crusaders rather than just soldiers. That's the work you asked me to do.\"\n\nThe four Italians wait, watching you with varying degrees of hope and nervousness. Around the courtyard, palace servants and guards have paused in their work to watch this scene.\n\nWhat do you do? Accept all four? Only some of them? What do you say to them?"

The Italians exchange glances, clearly uncertain what's happening. When you reach your chambers, García and Rodrigo stand at attention.\n\nThe banner case and reliquary chest sit where they were left. The afternoon light streams through the window, making the room glow.\n\nYou gesture for the Italians to stand back, then sink to your knees yourself at a respectful distance from the chest. You bow your head, clasp your hands, and pray silently. The room falls completely quiet - even the sounds from the street below seem to fade.\n\nAfter perhaps two minutes, you rise and turn to face the four men. In your careful Italian, you speak:\n\n\"What you see here... what these men guard... are the most sacred relics in Christendom.\" You pause to let that sink in. \"Inside that chest rests a fragment of the True Cross - the cross where Our Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins. And a bone of Santiago - Saint James himself, patron of Spain.\"\n\nPietro's hand flies to his mouth. Marco's eyes widen. Giovanni makes the sign of the cross repeatedly. Andrea looks confused, then awed as understanding dawns.\n\n\"Tomorrow morning,\" you continue in Italian, \"I say farewell to my captain and two of my men. They go on a mission for the crusade. And tomorrow morning, I may welcome new crusaders into my company.\"\n\nYou gesture toward the chest.\n\n\"You have until dawn to search your souls. To pray. To decide if you are ready to offer everything - your lives, your futures, your very souls - to this holy cause. The crusade will not end in weeks or months. It may take years. You will fight. You may die. You will face hardship and suffering.\"\n\nYou look each man in the eye, one by one.\n\n\"If you choose this path, you serve God through me. You become crusaders - not mercenaries, not adventurers, but soldiers of Christ. My confessor, Fray Hernando, will guide you spiritually. You will confess regularly, take communion, live by Christian virtue. This is not just a war. It is a holy mission.\"\n\nYou gesture to García and Rodrigo.\n\n\"These men will allow you to pray before the relics if you wish. One at a time, with respect. Fray Hernando will be available if you seek counsel or confession.\"\n\nYou step back.\n\n\"At dawn tomorrow, you will tell me your decision. If you choose to join, you will swear an oath. If you choose to leave, you may do so with my blessing and no shame - it takes wisdom to know one's limits.\"\n\nYou nod to Fray Hernando, who steps forward and continues in Italian, explaining that he'll be in the adjacent chamber if any wish to speak with him.\n\nMarco the mercenary is the first to approach the chest. He kneels at the respectful distance you demonstrated, removes his cap, and stares at the chest for a long moment before bowing his head in prayer. His lips move silently. After several minutes, he makes the sign of the cross and rises, his weathered face showing something like awe mixed with fear.\n\nPietro the merchant's son approaches next, almost trembling with excitement and reverence. He kneels and his prayer is more animated - you can hear whispered Italian, see him gesturing. When he finishes, tears stream down his young face.\n\nGiovanni the blacksmith limps forward and drops heavily to both knees with a grunt. He pulls out his rosary and begins praying the Pater Noster aloud in Italian, his voice cracking with emotion. He prays three complete prayers before crossing himself and struggling back to his feet.\n\nAndrea the farm boy is last and most uncertain. He kneels awkwardly, clearly not accustomed to formal prayer beyond simple church attendance. He stares at the chest, then at you, then back at the chest. His lips move but you can't tell if he's praying or just overwhelmed. After a minute, he makes a clumsy sign of the cross and stands.\n\nCaptain Fernán watches all this with his professional soldier's assessment, but you notice even his eyes are slightly wet.\n\nSir Thomas murmurs quietly in English, which you don't fully understand, but his tone suggests he's impressed.\n\nThe evening passes. You dine simply in your chambers. María sends word that she's making arrangements for the cathedral display and meetings with the Archbishop - she'll have details tomorrow.\n\nThrough the wall, you can occasionally hear voices from the adjacent chamber where Fray Hernando meets with the Italians. Marco's voice, low and intense. Pietro's younger, more anxious tones. Giovanni's rough, simple declarations. Andrea's halting confessions.\n\nNight falls over Barcelona. The palace settles into quiet. Your guards maintain their watch - García and Rodrigo with the relics, the others at your door.\n\nYou sleep fitfully, knowing that tomorrow Captain Fernán departs on a mission that may ignite civil war, and that you may be welcoming the first of many crusaders who will follow you to Granada.\n\nDawn breaks on August 19, 1430.\n\nYou wake to the sound of horses being prepared in the courtyard below. Captain Fernán's voice giving quiet orders. The clink of tack and weapons.\n\nWhen you descend to the courtyard with Fray Hernando and Sir Thomas, you find:\n\nCaptain Fernán ready to depart with Martín and Felipe. All three are armed and provisioned for hard riding. Three fresh horses stamp and snort in the cool morning air. The sealed letter to Álvaro is secured in Captain Fernán's saddlebag.\n\nAnd standing in a nervous cluster near the stable: Marco, Pietro, Giovanni, and Andrea. All four are present. All four have chosen to stay.\n\nCaptain Fernán sees you and approaches, bowing. \"Your Majesty. We're ready to depart. And it seems...\" He glances at the four Italians. \"You have new crusaders to welcome.\"\n\nThe courtyard is quiet in the early morning light. A few servants and guards watch from doorways and windows. This is the moment - bidding farewell to your most trusted commander, and accepting the first of those who will follow your white banner to Granada.\n\nWhat do you do? What do you say to Captain Fernán? And how do you welcome the four Italians into your crusade?"

He sees the assembled group and straightens, confusion and dawning understanding crossing his face.\n\nYou gesture for him to stand before you in the center of the courtyard. Captain Fernán moves to stand beside him.\n\n\"Corporal Rodrigo,\" you say clearly, your voice carrying across the courtyard so all present can hear. \"Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles departs this morning on urgent business for the crown. In his absence, you will assume command of my household guard and the defense of my person.\"\n\nRodrigo's eyes widen slightly, but he nods, his jaw set with determination.\n\nYou turn to Captain Fernán. \"Captain, please transfer your command.\"\n\nCaptain Fernán faces Rodrigo squarely. For a moment, emotion flickers across the older man's weathered face - pride, concern, trust. Then his voice becomes formal, the ritual of military command transfer that's been practiced for centuries.\n\n\"Corporal Rodrigo García, I hereby relinquish command of His Majesty's household guard. You are charged with the defense of the King's person, the security of the holy relics and treasury in our care, and the discipline and welfare of the men under your command.\"\n\nHe unbuckles his captain's sword belt - a finer weapon than the common guards carry, with worked leather and the royal insignia on the pommel - and holds it out.\n\n\"Do you accept this charge?\"\n\nRodrigo swallows hard, then speaks clearly: \"I do, Captain.\"\n\n\"Then serve the King with honor, protect him with your life, and lead with wisdom.\" Fernán buckles the sword belt around Rodrigo's waist, then steps back and salutes - fist to heart. \"Acting Captain Rodrigo.\"\n\nRodrigo returns the salute, his hand trembling slightly. \"Captain Fernán.\"\n\nAround the courtyard, García, the remaining guards, and even Martín and Felipe who are departing with Fernán, snap to attention and salute their new commander.\n\nCaptain Fernán turns back to you, and now his formality cracks slightly. He drops to one knee.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I will ride as fast as these horses can carry us. Two weeks to Valladolid, God willing. Don Álvaro will have your orders before September dawns.\" He looks up at you. \"And I will return to you in Seville. That's a promise.\"\n\nHis voice drops lower, for your ears primarily.\n\n\"Be careful in Barcelona. Trust Sir Thomas's tactical judgment - he knows war. Trust Rodrigo's loyalty - he'll die before he lets harm come to you. And trust your sister's political instincts - she knows this court better than any of us.\"\n\nHe rises, grips your forearm in the soldier's farewell, then turns to mount his horse. Martín and Felipe are already mounted, their faces showing the same mix of determination and apprehension that Fernán wears.\n\nThe three riders settle into their saddles. The horses sense their riders' urgency and prance restlessly.\n\nCaptain Fernán looks down at you one last time. \"Ride like the wind, you said. That we'll do, Your Majesty. For the crusade. For Castile.\" He touches his chest over his heart. \"Non nobis domine.\"\n\n\"Non nobis domine,\" you reply.\n\nHe wheels his horse toward the courtyard gate. Martín and Felipe fall in behind him. The three riders clatter across the cobblestones, through the gate, and into the Barcelona streets beyond.\n\nYou watch until they disappear around a corner, the sound of hoofbeats fading into the morning sounds of the waking city.\n\nWhen you turn back, Rodrigo stands straighter than you've ever seen him, his hand resting on his new sword. García has moved to stand beside him - the veteran sergeant supporting his young commander. Sir Thomas watches with the assessing eye of a professional, already calculating how to work with this new command structure.\n\nAnd the four Italians stand witnessing it all, understanding even through the language barrier that they've just seen something significant - a trusted commander departing on a dangerous mission, a young officer stepping up to replace him, and a king sending orders that may determine the fate of kingdoms.\n\nThe morning sun climbs higher over Barcelona.\n\nWhat do you do now? Welcome the four Italians formally as crusaders? Speak with Rodrigo about his new responsibilities? Address the assembled group? Something else?"

He asked me - begged me - to help him understand how to be a soldier who serves God rather than mammon. He knows he is imperfect. That awareness itself is grace.\"\n\nHe turns slightly toward Pietro.\n\n\"Pietro Aldobrandini is young and his faith is... enthusiastic but not yet deep. He has lived a comfortable merchant's life, confessed sins of vanity and minor dishonesty in trade. But his heart is genuinely moved. He prayed for two hours last night after I spoke with him. He asked me what books he should read to understand the faith better. He wants to learn. That desire to grow is what matters.\"\n\nHe looks at Giovanni.\n\n\"Giovanni Rossi is perhaps the simplest soul I've encountered in years. His confession was brief - he works hard, he loves his family, he sometimes loses his temper, he drinks too much on feast days. But when he speaks of God, his face...\" Fray Hernando pauses, visibly moved. \"There is a purity there. He told me, 'Father, I am old and broken, but I want to do one good thing before I die. I want to fight for Christ.' How can I say such a man is not ready?\"\n\nFinally, his gaze settles on Andrea.\n\n\"Andrea Vescovi barely understands what he's committing to. His confession was confused - he's not sure what counts as sin, he's never really thought deeply about faith beyond Sunday Mass and festivals. He's...\" Fray Hernando searches for words. \"He's raw clay, Your Majesty. Unformed. But willing to be shaped. When I asked him why he came, he said simply, 'The king said we could serve God. I want to serve God.' Sometimes the simplest faith is the truest.\"\n\nFray Hernando turns fully to face you.\n\n\"Are they perfect? No. Are they deeply learned in theology? No. Will they struggle with sin and temptation throughout this crusade? Absolutely.\" He pauses. \"But Your Majesty, you spoke truly - we are all sinners. These four men know their imperfection and are willing to acknowledge it. They came to confession voluntarily. They prayed before the True Cross with genuine reverence. They are willing to submit to spiritual discipline and guidance.\"\n\nHis voice grows firmer.\n\n\"Yes, Your Majesty. In my judgment as your confessor and as a servant of Holy Church, these men are ready to become soldiers of Christ. They will need instruction, correction, and continued spiritual formation. But they are ready to begin. They have said yes to the call. That is enough to start.\"\n\nHe makes the sign of the cross over the four Italians.\n\n\"With your permission, I will formally receive their crusading vows and hear their oaths. They will become the first of many who follow the white banner to Granada.\"\n\nThe four Italians watch this exchange, understanding from tone and gesture if not from words that Fray Hernando has spoken in their favor. Marco stands straighter. Pietro wipes his eyes. Giovanni clutches his rosary. Andrea looks both terrified and determined.\n\nRodrigo, standing nearby in his new captain's sword belt, watches intently. García and the other guards have formed up to witness. Sir Thomas observes with professional interest. A few palace servants have gathered at the edges of the courtyard, drawn by the unusual morning assembly.\n\nWhat do you do?

The gold reliquary with the True Cross fragment blazes in the light. The silver reliquary with Santiago's bone gleams below it. Even those who've seen it before - Sir Thomas, Fray Hernando, your guards - draw in their breath.\n\nThe four Italians stare in wonder. Pietro falls to his knees spontaneously. Giovanni makes the sign of the cross over and over, tears already streaming down his weathered face.\n\nGarcía and Rodrigo hold the banner upright between them, the white silk moving gently in the morning breeze.\n\nYou speak in your careful Italian, your voice carrying across the courtyard:\n\n\"I grant you the possibility to be soldiers of Christ and to be part of our crusade against Granada. The Pope himself charged me with this sacred mission and gave me these two relics so they may be carried against the heathens.\"\n\nYou gesture toward the banner.\n\n\"I touched them once upon accepting this charge, and I grant every soldier of Christ the same grace. You have already spoken with my confessor and I expect you to continue to do so for as long as you remain a soldier of Christ in the crusade.\"\n\nYour voice grows more serious, more commanding.\n\n\"When you become part of the crusade, you accept me as your only commander and you will follow no other orders except from me or from those I put in command.\"\n\nYou pause, letting this sink in, then continue with particular emphasis:\n\n\"You commit to behave in accordance with Christian values and virtues. No raping or forced conversions. Those Muslims who surrender will be treated fairly. Not only will you not commit these acts yourself, but you also swear to prevent others from doing so.\"\n\nAround the courtyard, several palace servants exchange glances. This is unusual. Most crusade oaths speak of destroying the infidel, not protecting them.\n\n\"When I see surrendered Muslims that are about to be shamelessly executed by those who call themselves true Christians, I would defend these Muslims with my life and I expect you to do the same.\"\n\nYour voice rings with conviction.\n\n\"We are all sinners, but we swear to fight where we can for justice, mercy and compassion. That is what it truly means to be a soldier of Christ.\"\n\nYou turn specifically to Andrea, the youngest, the farm boy who looks terrified and awed in equal measure.\n\n\"Andrea, do you understand what you are about to commit to?\"\n\nAndrea swallows hard. His hands twist his cap. For a long moment he's silent, and you wonder if he'll flee. Then he drops to his knees, his voice cracking but clear enough to hear:\n\n\"Sì, Vostra Maestà. Capisco.\" (Yes, Your Majesty. I understand.) He struggles with the words, then adds in simpler Italian: \"I serve you. I serve Cristo. I protect... even Muslims who surrender. I be... I try to be good soldier of Christ.\"\n\nHis grammar is rough, his understanding perhaps incomplete, but his sincerity is absolute.\n\nYou draw your father's sword - the blade that bears the inscription Non Nobis Domine. The sound of steel leaving the scabbard is sharp in the quiet morning.\n\nYou step forward and tap Andrea gently on his right shoulder with the flat of the blade, then his left shoulder.\n\n\"I accept you, Andrea Vescovi, as the very first crusader and soldier of Christ in my crusade to retake Granada.\"\n\nAndrea's breath catches. Tears stream down his young face.\n\n\"You may now, for the first and last time in your life on this earth, touch the relics that you will help carry toward Granada.\"\n\nGarcía and Rodrigo lower the banner carefully, bringing the reliquaries to a height where Andrea can reach them while kneeling.\n\nAndrea stares at the gold reliquary containing the fragment of the True Cross. His hand trembles as he extends it. He touches the gold housing with just his fingertips, barely making contact, as if afraid he might damage it or isn't worthy. His lips move in silent prayer.\n\nThen he touches the silver reliquary with Santiago's bone. His whole body shakes with emotion.\n\nHe remains there for perhaps thirty seconds, his rough farmer's hand resting gently on the sacred vessels, tears falling freely onto the cobblestones beneath him.\n\nFinally he withdraws his hand, makes the sign of the cross, and looks up at you with an expression of such pure devotion that even hardened soldiers around the courtyard look away, overcome.\n\nYou help him to his feet. He can barely stand, his legs weak with emotion.\n\nYou turn to the other three. \"Who is next?\"\n\nMarco the mercenary steps forward without hesitation. He kneels with a soldier's practiced grace, his weathered face showing something you haven't seen there before - hope mixed with humility.\n\nHe speaks his oath in clear Italian, his voice steady: \"I understand, Your Majesty. I have killed for money. I have done shameful things. But I swear before God and these holy relics - I will follow your orders alone. I will protect the innocent. I will be a soldier of Christ, not of mammon. This I swear.\"\n\nYou tap his shoulders with your sword. \"I accept you, Marco Tornesi, as a crusader and soldier of Christ.\"\n\nMarco touches the relics firmly, confidently, like a man finally finding something solid to hold onto after years of drifting. When he rises, he salutes you with fist to heart - but then adds a bow of genuine respect that no mercenary would give for mere pay.\n\nPietro the merchant's son practically leaps forward, then remembers himself and drops to his knees more decorously. His youthful face shines with excitement and religious fervor.\n\n\"Your Majesty, I swear it all! I will follow you! I will be virtuous! I will protect even Muslims who surrender!\" His enthusiasm makes several guards smile despite the solemnity. \"I will be the best crusader I can be! I swear before God and Santiago!\"\n\nYou tap his shoulders. \"I accept you, Pietro Aldobrandini, as a crusader and soldier of Christ.\"\n\nPietro touches the relics and immediately begins weeping and praying loudly in Italian, thanking God, thanking you, thanking Santiago. After several moments, Fray Hernando gently touches his shoulder, and Pietro reluctantly rises, still sniffling.\n\nGiovanni the blacksmith limps forward last. He drops heavily to both knees with a grunt, his injured leg unable to manage a graceful kneel. His three-fingered hand clutches his rosary.\n\nHis Italian is rough, working-class, but clear: \"Maestà, I am old. I am broken. But I am strong still. I fight for Cristo. I follow you. I protect who you say protect. I die if I must. This is good. This is...\" He struggles for words, then simply says, \"This is what I want. To do good thing before I die.\"\n\nYou tap his shoulders. \"I accept you, Giovanni Rossi, as a crusader and soldier of Christ.\"\n\nGiovanni touches the relics with both his good hand and his damaged one, pressing them against the gold and silver as if trying to absorb their holiness through his skin. He prays in simple, repetitive phrases - thanking God, asking for strength, promising to serve. When he rises, he has to brace against the banner pole to stand, but his face shows peace.\n\nThe ceremony is complete. Four men have become crusaders - the first of what you hope will be thousands.\n\nFray Hernando steps forward and raises his hands, blessing the four new crusaders in Latin. Then he switches to Italian:\n\n\"You are soldiers of Christ now. You serve God through His anointed king. You carry the holy relics toward Granada. This is sacred work. Remember your oaths. Confess your sins regularly. Take communion. Live as Christians, fight as Christians, and if God wills it, die as Christians knowing your souls are saved.\"\n\nAround the courtyard, witnesses have multiplied. More palace servants, several of María's ladies, guards from the royal palace, even a few early-rising Barcelona citizens who heard something unusual was happening. They've watched this entire ceremony.\n\nOne of the palace guards - an Aragonese soldier - murmurs to his companion in Catalan, just loud enough for you to overhear: \"Did he just swear to defend surrendered Moors? That's... unusual.\"\n\nHis companion responds: \"Unusual? It's unprecedented. But did you see those men's faces? They believed every word.\"\n\nRodrigo, your new captain, stands watching with his hand on his sword. You see him reassessing the four Italians - no longer just potential recruits, but now sworn crusaders under his protection and command.\n\nSir Thomas approaches and speaks quietly in Latin so the Italians won't understand: \"Your Majesty, that oath about protecting surrendered Muslims... it's noble, but it will cause problems. Soldiers in the heat of battle, or after seeing their friends killed... they won't want to show mercy. You'll need iron discipline to enforce that.\"\n\nGarcía, the veteran sergeant, adds his perspective: \"But if you can enforce it, Your Majesty, you'll build an army different from any other. Men will know they serve something higher than blood and plunder.\"\n\nThe four new crusaders stand together now, Andrea still wiping his eyes, Pietro grinning despite his tears, Giovanni gripping his rosary, Marco standing with military bearing but softer eyes than he had an hour ago.\n\nThe white banner with its sacred relics stands between García and Rodrigo, catching the morning sun, visible to everyone in the courtyard and anyone looking down from palace windows above.\n\nWhat do you do now? Address the assembled witnesses? Speak to your new crusaders about their duties? Have the banner returned to its case? Something else?"

          "text": "Originally in Juan's party when they left Rome (10 people):\n1. Juan II\n2. Captain Fernán Alonso de Robles (commander) - DEPARTED with letter to Álvaro\n3. Fray Hernando de Talavera (confessor)\n4. Sergeant García (proven loyal guard)\n5. Corporal Rodrigo (proven loyal guard) - NOW ACTING CAPTAIN\n6. Martín (guard) - DEPARTED with Captain Fernán\n7. Felipe (guard) - DEPARTED with Captain Fernán\n8. Diego (secretary) - not a fighter\n9. Sir Thomas Beaumont (English knight)\n10. Peter (Sir Thomas's squire)\n\nSo three people departed: Captain Fernán, Martín, Felipe\n\nThat leaves:\n- Juan II (king)\n- Fray Hernando (confessor, not a fighter)\n- García (sergeant, experienced soldier)\n- Rodrigo (now acting captain, was a guard)\n- Diego (secretary, not a fighter)\n- Sir Thomas (knight, experienced soldier)\n- Peter (squire, can fight but young)\n\nRoyal guards specifically: García and Rodrigo are the original royal guards. But Rodrigo is now captain so shouldn't be doing regular guard rotations.\n\nJust added:\n- Marco Tornesi (mercenary, experienced soldier)\n- Pietro Aldobrandini (merchant's son, inexperienced)\n- Giovanni Rossi (blacksmith, old and injured but willing)\n- Andrea Vescovi (farm boy, inexperienced)\n\nSo for actual fighters/guards:\n- García (experienced royal guard)\n- Sir Thomas (experienced knight)\n- Peter (squire, some combat ability)\n- Marco (experienced mercenary)\n- Pietro (inexperienced but enthusiastic)\n- Giovanni (limited by age and injury)\n- Andrea (raw and inexperienced)\n\nRodrigo as captain oversees but shouldn't be in regular rotation.\n\nThe defensive lineup looks critically undermanned. With only a handful of truly capable fighters, protecting valuable cargo seems precarious. The mix of experienced soldiers and untrained recruits creates significant vulnerabilities in their security arrangement.\n\nRodrigo steps forward at your question, clearly already thinking through this same issue. He glances around at the assembled group, counting.\n\n\"Your Majesty, we're thin on experienced men now.\" He ticks off on his fingers. \"García is our only remaining royal guard with proper training. Sir Thomas is a knight with combat experience. Peter his squire has some skill. Diego is your secretary - he can use a knife but he's not a soldier.\"\n\nHe looks at the four new crusaders.\n\n\"Marco has mercenary experience - he's a real fighter. But Pietro, Giovanni, and Andrea...\" He pauses diplomatically. \"They need training before they can be trusted with guarding the relics alone.\"\n\nGarcía adds his gruff assessment: \"The boy Andrea is strong but green as spring grass. Pietro the merchant has enthusiasm but no discipline yet. Giovanni the smith has spirit but he's old and lame - in a real fight, he'd be a liability more than an asset.\"\n\nSir Thomas steps forward, speaking in Latin so the Italians won't understand: \"Your Majesty, by my count you have three reliable fighters besides yourself: García, myself, and Marco. Peter can serve adequately. The other three Italians need weeks of training before I'd trust them in combat.\"\n\nHe pauses, then continues: \"For guarding the relics and treasury, I suggest rotating pairs. García and Marco together - the veteran and the professional. Sir Thomas and Peter. That gives you two solid teams. The three inexperienced Italians can stand watch during daylight in safe locations, but not at night or in uncertain situations.\"\n\nRodrigo nods agreement. \"That's sound, Your Majesty. And I'll oversee everything as captain, ready to respond if there's trouble. But you're right - I can't be in regular guard rotation and command effectively.\"\n\nHe looks concerned. \"Your Majesty, forgive my bluntness, but we're stretched thin. Captain Fernán, Martín, and Felipe are gone. That's three experienced soldiers. We've added four men, but only one is combat-ready. Until the others are trained...\"\n\nGarcía adds: \"We're adequate for Barcelona - it's a safe city, we're in the royal palace. But if we face real danger on the road or in hostile territory, we'll be vulnerable. We need more trained men, Your Majesty. Proper soldiers, not enthusiastic boys and old smiths.\"\n\nThe four new crusaders stand nearby, understanding from tone if not words that they're being assessed and found wanting in some ways. Marco stands straight, clearly confident in his abilities. Pietro looks slightly deflated. Giovanni seems unbothered - he knows his limitations. Andrea just looks confused.\n\nHow do you want to organize the guard rotations? And do you plan to recruit more soldiers while in Barcelona?"

But you're right - if Granada has been mobilizing and receiving support from North Africa as the rumors suggest...\"\n\nSir Thomas steps forward, his expression thoughtful. \"Your Majesty, the sea route is normally faster - perhaps a week from Barcelona to Seville by galley with good winds. The land route through Aragon and into Castile would take three weeks, possibly four if we encounter difficulties.\"\n\nHe pauses, clearly weighing options.\n\n\"But the Mediterranean has become more dangerous if Granada has war galleys active. And corsairs...\" He frowns. \"They'd love to capture a ship carrying the King of Castile, not to mention holy relics and a fortune in crusade funds. Even a well-armed merchant galley could be overwhelmed by multiple war galleys working together.\"\n\nGarcía adds his gruff perspective: \"On land, Your Majesty, we can see threats coming. We can choose our route, avoid dangerous areas, camp where we want. On a ship, if we're spotted and pursued, there's nowhere to run. We're trapped on a wooden box in the middle of the sea.\"\n\nHe scratches his beard. \"But land travel through Aragon... that means passing through territory where the Infantes have influence. Through areas where your enemies might have sympathizers. Word of your route could leak, and ambushes could be prepared.\"\n\nRodrigo weighs in: \"With only seven capable fighters - counting you, Your Majesty - we're vulnerable either way. On a ship, we're dependent on the crew and captain. On land, we can at least control our own defense, but we're exposed to bandits, hostile nobles, or worse.\"\n\nSir Thomas adds: \"There's also the matter of time, Your Majesty. You have the Royal Council in Seville on November 8th. It's now August 19th. You wanted to spend two to three weeks here in Barcelona building support. That puts us departing Barcelona in early September. Three to four weeks overland means arriving in Seville in late September or early October - giving you a month to prepare before the Council. That's adequate but not generous.\"\n\nHe continues: \"By sea, you'd arrive mid-September with six weeks to prepare. That extra time could be valuable for coordinating with Don Álvaro, meeting with supporters, planning your presentation of the crusade bull.\"\n\nRodrigo looks uncomfortable giving advice on such a weighty decision so soon after assuming command, but he tries: \"Your Majesty, perhaps... could we gather more intelligence first? Your sister might know the current state of Granada's naval activity. Are their galleys actively patrolling? Have there been recent attacks on Christian shipping? That information would help us decide.\"\n\nGarcía nods. \"And we could hire local guides who know the land routes - which roads are safest, which areas to avoid. Get a better sense of the actual dangers before committing.\"\n\nSir Thomas adds: \"We could also consider a mixed approach - travel overland through Aragon to the Castilian border, then reassess. If the situation seems safe, we could take ship from Valencia or Cartagena for just the final leg. That reduces sea exposure while still saving some time.\"\n\nAll three men look at you, waiting for your decision or guidance. The four new Italian crusaders watch without understanding the discussion, but sensing its importance.\n\nFrom a palace window above, you catch a glimpse of movement - someone watching. One of María's ladies, perhaps, or palace servants observing the foreign king and his deliberations.\n\nWhat do you decide? Gather more intelligence first? Choose a route now? Consider the mixed approach?"

Witty and perceptive. Questions assumptions politely but persistently.\n\nChallenge: Politically appropriate match, but would tie Juan to Catalan nobility and complicate his independence. Her father serves Alfonso V, creating potential conflict of interest.\n\nHook: She's fascinated by Juan's spiritual journey but skeptical of certainty - echoes Fray Hernando's concerns in a different voice.\n\n2 - Isabel Ruiz\n\nAge: 17\n\nStatus: Daughter of a wealthy Barcelona merchant (converso - Jewish convert to Christianity)\n\nPosition: Friend of María's, occasionally at court for social events\n\nAppearance: Auburn hair (unusual), pale skin, freckles, bright green eyes\n\nPersonality: Passionate about faith, having grown up in a converso family constantly proving their Christianity. Earnest, idealistic, sees Juan as embodiment of true Christian virtue.\n\nChallenge: Converso background would be controversial among nobility. Her idealization of Juan might be uncomfortable - she sees him as nearly saintly.\n\nHook: Her family could provide financial backing for the crusade, but romance would be seen as marrying \"beneath\" his station.\n\n3 - Beatriz Álvarez\n\nAge: 19\n\nStatus: Impoverished distant relation of the Mendoza family\n\nPosition: María's handmaiden, essentially a servant though technically noble blood\n\nAppearance: Pretty in a simple way, brown hair usually hidden under a servant's cap, warm brown eyes, work-roughened hands\n\nPersonality: Quiet, observant, surprisingly educated (taught to read by a kindly priest). Devout but practical. Sees through pretense.\n\nChallenge: Far too low status for a king. Any relationship would be scandalous. Would be seen as Juan using his power inappropriately.\n\nHook: She witnessed his ceremony with the crusaders and was moved to tears. She embodies the common people's faith he spoke about in Florence.\n\n4 - Leonor de Montcada\n\nAge: 22\n\nStatus: Daughter of one of Catalonia's most powerful families\n\nPosition: Widow (married at 16, husband died a year ago in Italian wars), now living with Queen María\n\nAppearance: Striking rather than beautiful, tall, dark eyes that have seen grief, dresses in subdued colors\n\nPersonality: Mature beyond her years, melancholic but not broken. Intelligent, politically astute. Understands loss and duty.\n\nChallenge: Politically powerful match - Montcada support would be valuable but comes with strings. She's older than Juan and might dominate the relationship. Some whisper she's unlucky (young widow).\n\nHook: She understands the weight of duty and sacrifice in ways most don't. Their conversations could be profound but also dangerous to his certainty.\n\n5 - Margarita \"Margot\" Ferrer\n\nAge: 18\n\nStatus: Apothecary's daughter from Barcelona's merchant quarter\n\nPosition: Sometimes delivers medicines to the palace, no formal court position\n\nAppearance: Blonde (unusual in Spain), blue eyes, practical clothing, often smells faintly of herbs\n\nPersonality: Sharp-minded, educated in medicine and herbs by her father. Skeptical of nobility but curious about the world. Speaks bluntly, unimpressed by titles.\n\nChallenge: Common-born, completely inappropriate match. She'd challenge his assumptions constantly. Romance would be pure scandal.\n\nHook: She might be called to palace if someone falls ill. Her practical, no-nonsense approach to life contrasts sharply with Juan's spiritual intensity. She'd question whether certainty is faith or pride.\n\n6 - Sister Teresa María\n\nAge: 21\n\nStatus: Nun, formerly minor Aragonese nobility (family name: Ximénez)\n\nPosition: From convent of Santa Clara in Barcelona, sometimes sent to palace to assist with Queen María's charitable work\n\nAppearance: Habit conceals most features, but glimpses of dark hair, pale skin, delicate features. Moves with quiet grace.\n\nPersonality: Deeply pious, took vows at 17 after a religious experience. Gentle, compassionate, but with core of steel. Sees God's hand in everything.\n\nChallenge: This would be catastrophic - she's a bride of Christ, her vows are sacred. Any romantic feeling would be sinful for both. Would force Juan to confront his own humanity vs. his spiritual mission.\n\nHook: She heard about his offering before the Pope and wants to meet him. Their spiritual conversations could be profound but also dangerous - two people certain of God's will, but in different ways.\n\nEach option creates different tensions:\n\nOptions 1 & 4: Politically appropriate but complicated\n\nOptions 2 & 3: Sympathetic but socially inappropriate\n\nOption 5: Complete commoner, maximum social barrier\n\nOption 6: Spiritually impossible, maximum internal conflict\n\nRoll 1d6 to determine which woman catches Juan's eye during his time in Barcelona."

          "text": "Now, back to the practical question about ships and the journey. Juan is asking if acquiring multiple ships would make them safer. This is actually a smart strategic question.\n\nLet me have Rodrigo and Sir Thomas respond to this with practical military/naval considerations.\n\nRodrigo's eyebrows rise slightly at the question - clearly he hadn't considered this option. He looks to Sir Thomas, who has more naval experience.\n\nSir Thomas nods thoughtfully. \"Your Majesty, that's actually sound military thinking. Multiple ships reduce risk in several ways.\"\n\nHe ticks off points on his fingers:\n\n\"First, if one ship is damaged or attacked, you don't lose everything. The relics, treasury, and your person could be distributed across vessels - if corsairs take one, they don't capture it all. Second, multiple ships can defend each other. Three merchant galleys traveling together are much less attractive targets than one alone. Pirates prefer easy prey.\"\n\nHe pauses, considering.\n\n\"Third, and perhaps most important - if we hire multiple ships, we control the small fleet. We're not just passengers dependent on one captain's decisions. We could have our own men on each vessel, coordinate our movements, choose our route together.\"\n\nGarcía adds his perspective: \"And it means more swords if we need to fight. Even if the crews are merchants, not warriors, three ships means triple the manpower. That matters in a boarding action.\"\n\nRodrigo nods, warming to the idea. \"Your Majesty, it would also give us flexibility. If one ship has problems - storms damage it, illness breaks out among the crew - we can transfer to another. We're not trapped with one option.\"\n\nSir Thomas continues: \"The question is cost and coordination. Three galleys from Barcelona to Seville...\" He calculates mentally. \"Probably 5,000-6,000 florins total, possibly more if we want quality vessels with experienced crews. And we'd need to ensure they all sail together - that requires coordination, possibly hiring captains who've worked together before.\"\n\nHe strokes his beard thoughtfully.\n\n\"There's also the question of what we're protecting and how we divide it. The relics and you, Your Majesty, should obviously be on the flagship - the best and fastest vessel. The treasury could be split across the other ships. We'd need guards distributed across all three vessels.\"\n\nGarcía points out: \"That spreads our fighters thin, Your Majesty. Seven capable men across three ships means maybe two or three per vessel. Each ship becomes more vulnerable individually, even though the fleet is stronger together.\"\n\nRodrigo adds: \"We'd need to decide command structure too. Who leads each ship's contingent? Marco could command one, Sir Thomas another, García the third with you and me on the flagship. But that separates our experienced fighters.\"\n\nSir Thomas nods. \"It's a trade-off, Your Majesty. Greater overall security but more complex logistics. And there's another consideration - three ships are more visible than one. We'd attract more attention in every port. Harder to move quietly if that's what you wanted.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly.\n\n\"But if your concern is Granada's naval strength, then yes - multiple ships significantly improve your odds of reaching Seville safely. It's sound strategy, just expensive and complicated.\"\n\nRodrigo ventures: \"Your Majesty, perhaps we could ask your sister? Queen María would know which Barcelona shipping houses are reliable, which captains work well together, what the current costs are. She might even be able to arrange favorable terms through her position.\"\n\nGarcía adds pragmatically: \"And we should still gather intelligence about Granada's fleet. If their galleys aren't actually operating this far north, we might be spending a fortune on extra ships we don't need. But if they are a real threat...\" He shrugs. \"Then three ships could be the difference between reaching Seville and being captured.\"\n\nThe morning is advancing - you can hear the palace coming fully to life around you. The four new Italian crusaders stand waiting for direction. The banner still rests in the courtyard, catching sunlight.\n\nWhat do you want to do? Consult with María about ships and Granada's naval activity? Make a decision about the route now? Focus on other matters first while you gather information?"

          "text": "1. He wants to petition Aragon for safe naval passage to Seville\n2. He clarifies that the four guards of the banner (García, Rodrigo, and... wait, Rodrigo is now captain. Let me check who the four guards are now.)\n\nActually, looking back:\n- Originally it was Captain Fernán, García, Rodrigo, and Felipe rotating guard on the banner\n- But now Fernán, Felipe, and Martín have left for Castile\n- Rodrigo is now captain\n- So the guard rotation was reorganized to: García and Marco as one pair, Sir Thomas and Peter as another pair\n\nSo Juan is saying he wants these guards to stay with the banner - meaning if they travel by multiple ships, the banner and its guards all go on the same ship. That makes sense.\n\n3. He's telling them to prepare for cathedral display\n4. He's delegating recruitment to Rodrigo and spiritual formation to Fray Hernando\n5. He's asking about arming the new recruits\n\nLet me have Rodrigo respond about the equipment situation, and also address the practical implications of Juan's decisions.\n\nRodrigo straightens at your clear direction. \"Understood, Your Majesty. The banner and its guards stay together on one ship - no separation. That's simpler and maintains our sacred charge properly.\"\n\nHe glances at the four Italians, assessing them with his new captain's eye.\n\n\"As for arming the new recruits... García and I have already discussed this. The palace armory here might lend us some equipment, or we'll need to purchase from Barcelona smiths. Let me outline what we need:\"\n\nHe counts on his fingers:\n\n\"Marco already has his own weapons - a good sword, a dagger, basic traveling gear. He's equipped. Pietro brought money and purchased a sword in Florence, but it's decorative, meant for a gentleman. We'll need to get him a proper weapon. Giovanni has a smith's hammer he's used as a weapon before, and blacksmith's strength, but he needs a real mace or axe suited to his build and his missing fingers. Andrea has nothing but a farm knife.\"\n\nHe pauses, calculating.\n\n\"Basic equipment for the three who need it - swords or other weapons, some leather armor, helmets, shields - probably 800-1,000 florins total. We could outfit them more cheaply with simpler gear, or spend more for quality equipment that will last the entire crusade.\"\n\nSir Thomas adds: \"Your Majesty, there's also the question of whether to arm them with what they can use now versus training them for what they should use. Andrea is strong - he could learn to use a pike or pollaxe. But that takes training. A simple sword and shield is easier to learn quickly but less effective in formation fighting.\"\n\nGarcía grunts: \"The boy needs a shield and something he can't hurt himself with. Maybe a mace. Simple, effective, hard to mess up. The merchant's son needs proper sword training before we give him anything sharp. The smith...\" He nods toward Giovanni. \"Give him a proper war hammer. He knows how to swing a hammer already.\"\n\nRodrigo nods agreement, then continues:\n\n\"I'll arrange purchases today or tomorrow. The sooner they have equipment, the sooner they can start training with it properly - you're absolutely right about that, Your Majesty.\" He looks more confident now, settling into his role. \"And I'll be ready to assess any new crusaders who approach. Father Hernando and I will work together - I judge their martial capability, he judges their spiritual readiness.\"\n\nFray Hernando inclines his head. \"I will continue as we've begun, Your Majesty. Any man who wishes to join will speak with me, confess, and prove their sincerity before being presented to you.\"\n\nRodrigo shifts to your other directives:\n\n\"For the cathedral display, Your Majesty - when do you want this to happen? Today? Tomorrow? And how long should the relics remain on display? A few hours? All day? Multiple days?\" He's thinking through security logistics. \"We'll need guards posted, crowd control, someone to prevent people from pressing too close or trying to touch the reliquaries...\"\n\nSir Thomas adds: \"It will draw enormous crowds, Your Majesty. Everyone in Barcelona will want to see the True Cross. We should coordinate with the cathedral guards and city watch. It needs to be managed properly or it could become chaos.\"\n\nFray Hernando speaks up: \"Your Majesty, might I suggest the display coincide with Mass? Perhaps tomorrow morning - that way the Bishop can properly frame the viewing within liturgy, explain the significance, maintain proper reverence. It becomes a sacred event, not just spectacle.\"\n\nRodrigo nods. \"That's wise, Father. And it gives us today to prepare, coordinate with cathedral authorities, ensure proper security.\"\n\nHe looks at you. \"Should I speak with Queen María about arrangements? She could facilitate coordination with the Bishop and cathedral authorities. And regarding your petition to Aragon for safe passage...\" He hesitates slightly. \"That would also go through her, wouldn't it? Or did you mean to approach the Consell Reial directly?\"\n\nGarcía adds gruffly: \"And this intelligence gathering about Granada's fleet - who does that? Do we ask the Queen's contacts? Send men to the docks to talk to sailors? Visit merchant houses that trade in the Mediterranean?\"\n\nThe four Italian crusaders are beginning to look restless, standing at attention but clearly uncertain what they're supposed to do now. Pietro keeps glancing at the banner with obvious longing. Marco stands professionally but you can see he's wondering about his next orders. Giovanni shifts his weight off his bad leg. Andrea just looks overwhelmed by everything.\n\nWhat are your priorities? Meet with María to arrange cathedral display and discuss safe passage? Have Rodrigo start working on equipment immediately? Address the new crusaders about their immediate duties? Something else?"

This is good practical command - keeping the new recruits occupied while the leadership discusses strategy.\n\nLet me have Rodrigo handle this professionally, showing he's settling into his captain role. The Italians will be relieved to have clear direction. Then we can move to the planning discussion.\n\nRodrigo nods immediately. \"Yes, Your Majesty.\"\n\nHe turns to the four Italians and switches to Italian - his accent is rough but understandable. \"You four - come with García. We start training now. Basic sword work, formation drills. Move!\"\n\nGarcía steps forward with the no-nonsense efficiency of a veteran sergeant. He gestures sharply, and the four crusaders snap to attention - even Andrea manages it reasonably well. Marco falls in naturally, Pietro eagerly, Giovanni with determination despite his limp, Andrea with confusion but willingness.\n\n\"Sir Thomas,\" García calls. \"Help me with these recruits?\"\n\nSir Thomas nods and joins them. The six men move to a clear area of the courtyard. You can hear García's gruff voice beginning basic instruction: \"Feet apart. Balance. No, boy, balance...\"\n\nRodrigo then directs two guards: \"Secure the banner. Carefully. Back to His Majesty's chambers, standard watch rotation.\"\n\nThe guards move efficiently, García and another man carefully lifting the great white banner with its mounted reliquaries. They carry it reverently back into the palace, the silk catching morning light one last time before disappearing through the doorway.\n\nWithin minutes, the courtyard has transformed from ceremonial space to training ground. The sounds of García barking instructions, wooden practice swords clacking, Sir Thomas correcting stances, and the new crusaders trying to follow orders fill the air.\n\nRodrigo turns back to you, Sir Thomas having been pulled into training duty. \"Your Majesty, we have privacy now. What are your priorities for the planning?\"\n\nDiego, your secretary, steps forward with his writing materials. \"Shall I take notes, Your Majesty?\"\n\nFray Hernando remains nearby, ready to offer counsel.\n\nThe morning sun climbs higher over Barcelona. You can hear the city waking fully - market sounds, church bells, the general bustle of a major port. From the courtyard comes the rhythmic sound of training.\n\nWhat do you want to discuss and plan? The cathedral display? Petitioning Aragon for safe passage? Intelligence gathering about Granada? Meeting with your sister?"

Rodrigo coordinates with church and city guards\n3. Wooden barriers/fences inside church for crowd control\n4. Juan will meet with María to discuss meeting the Consell Reial\n5.

Let's have Rodrigo ask one practical question, then move to the meeting with María where Isabel will be present.\n\nRodrigo nods crisply. \"Understood, Your Majesty. I'll go to the cathedral immediately after we finish here. Coordinate with the Bishop's guards and the city watch. Wooden barriers around the banner with clear space for our guards to maintain control.\"\n\nHe pauses, thinking through logistics. \"One question, Your Majesty - how long should the relics remain on display after Mass? Just during the service, or throughout the day? The longer they're displayed, the more people can see them, but also the longer we maintain security in a public space.\"\n\nFray Hernando adds quietly: \"Your Majesty, I should be present during the display. To help maintain proper reverence, to explain the significance of the relics to those who view them, to ensure this remains a sacred moment rather than mere spectacle. With your permission, I'll coordinate with the cathedral's clergy about my role.\"\n\nHe pauses, then continues: \"And perhaps... given that this is Barcelona Cathedral, one of the great churches of Christendom, we should invite the Archbishop of Zaragoza if he's still in the city. Your sister mentioned he's here. His presence would lend additional gravity and could serve your broader purposes - he leads the Consell Reial, after all.\"\n\nRodrigo's eyes light up slightly. \"That's clever, Father. The Archbishop sees the relics, understands what His Majesty carries, and that makes the subsequent meeting about supporting the crusade more... informed.\"\n\nDiego, still standing with his writing materials despite being told notes aren't needed, ventures nervously: \"Your Majesty, should I prepare any formal documents? Letters of introduction to the Consell? Copies of... well, we don't have the actual crusade bull here, but perhaps a summary of the Pope's support?\"\n\nFrom the training area, you hear García's voice: \"No, no, boy! Guard up! Do you want to lose your head?!\" followed by the clack of wooden swords and what sounds like Andrea stumbling.\n\nAny response to these questions before you go to meet with María?

          "text": "**Factors favoring success:**\n\n1. **The relics themselves** - Fragment of the True Cross and bone of Saint James are extraordinarily powerful. People in medieval Barcelona would be desperate to see these. Religious fervor is real and intense.\n\n2. **Papal authority** - The crusade bull from Pope Martin V carries immense weight. The church hierarchy must respect it.\n\n3. **Florence precedent** - Juan already proved this approach works spectacularly in Florence (critical success). Word of that has likely reached Barcelona.\n\n4. **María's support** - His sister is Queen of Aragon, managing the court. She can facilitate meetings, arrange access, smooth political complications.\n\n5. **Archbishop of Zaragoza present** - The most important ecclesiastical figure in Aragon, who leads the Consell Reial, is in Barcelona. Direct access to him is valuable.\n\n6. **Smart execution** - Keeping relics in cathedral (sacred space, better security), limiting display time (creates scarcity/urgency), having papal bull read aloud multiple times, clear donation/recruitment mechanisms. This shows Juan has learned from Florence.\n\n7. **Time available** - Staying \"for a while\" allows sustained impact, multiple viewings, word to spread, recruitment to build.\n\n8. **Testing recruits** - Rodrigo and Hernando filtering candidates ensures quality, which builds reputation.\n\n**Factors complicating success:**\n\n1. **This is Barcelona, not Florence** - Barcelona is Alfonso V's city. The Infantes have influence here. Political complications that didn't exist in Florence.\n\n2. **Competing loyalties** - Catalans are proud of their independence. They may be cautious about committing to a Castilian king's crusade, even with papal backing.\n \nThe Infantes' reputation campaign creates significant doubt. Their strategic narrative portrays Juan as unstable and mystical, potentially undermining his credibility among nobles. This deliberate character assassination could predispose key decision-makers to skepticism about his crusade mission.\n\nAlfonso V's absence in Naples adds another layer of uncertainty. Without the king's clear endorsement, potential supporters might hesitate, waiting to understand the official royal position on Juan's ambitious crusade plans.\n\nThe impending tension from Juan's orders to Captain Fernán to arrest the Infantes looms like an unresolved threat. Politically astute observers can sense the brewing conflict, which could distract from or undermine the crusade recruitment efforts.\n\nEconomic challenges remain a critical unknown factor that could dramatically impact the crusade's potential success. The Florence campaign's success will spark curiosity and excitement in Barcelona, creating a ripple of anticipation. María's strategic involvement ensures key participants are engaged and potential political barriers are smoothed over.\n\nI'm confident this effort will succeed. The combination of powerful religious symbols, papal authority, and carefully orchestrated presentation makes failure unlikely. While Barcelona's political landscape presents nuanced challenges, the underlying momentum of religious fervor and Juan's sophisticated approach strongly favor a positive outcome.\n\nSuccess hinges on generating significant public and institutional support. Potential scenarios range from moderate engagement with modest donations and recruits to an overwhelming response that transforms Juan's regional standing. The key metrics include turnout, financial contributions, quality of candidates attracted, and institutional backing from religious and political leaders.\n\nRisks exist - political caution or unexpected disruptions could temper the campaign's impact. However, the foundational elements are robust: compelling relics, papal endorsement, and María's expert facilitation significantly mitigate potential setbacks.\n\nProbability Assessment: Barcelona Cathedral Display and Recruitment Campaign\n\nRodrigo, Fray Hernando, and Diego all nod, understanding their roles. Rodrigo departs immediately to coordinate with the cathedral. Fray Hernando begins preparing for his pastoral role during the display.\n\nBefore you proceed to meet with María, I need to assess the likelihood of success for this multi-faceted action.\n\nFactors Favoring Success:\n\nThe Sacred Relics - A fragment of the True Cross and Saint James's bone are extraordinarily powerful in this era. Religious fervor in medieval Barcelona is intense and genuine.\n\nPapal Authority - The crusade bull from Pope Martin V carries immense weight. Church hierarchy, including the Archbishop of Zaragoza, must respect direct papal commission.\n\nFlorence Precedent - You've already proven this approach works spectacularly. Word of Florence has reached Barcelona, creating anticipation and curiosity.\n\nSmart Execution - Keeping relics in cathedral (sacred space, better security), limiting display time (creates urgency), having bull read aloud repeatedly, clear donation/recruitment mechanisms, quality filtering of recruits. You've learned from Florence.\n\nQueen María's Support - Your sister manages Alfonso's court in his absence. She can facilitate meetings with the Archbishop, smooth political complications, ensure the right people attend.\n\nArchbishop of Zaragoza Present - Direct access to the man who leads the Consell Reial is extremely valuable. If he's impressed, doors open throughout Aragon.\n\nTime Available - Multi-day display allows sustained impact, word to spread, recruitment to build naturally.\n\nFactors Complicating Success:\n\nThis is Alfonso V's City - Political complications that didn't exist in Florence. The Infantes have influence here. Some Aragonese may be cautious about committing to a Castilian king's crusade.\n\nCompeting Loyalties - Catalans are fiercely proud of their independence. They may be wary of Castilian projects even with papal backing.\n\nThe Infantes' Narrative - Juan and Enrique have been spreading stories about you being unstable and dominated by Álvaro. Some nobles may be predisposed to doubt.\n\nAlfonso V's Absence and Unclear Position - The king is in Naples. His view of your crusade is uncertain. Some may wait to see what Alfonso says before committing resources.\n\nEconomic Competition - Catalan merchants may be less enthusiastic than Florentines about funding a crusade that primarily benefits Castile.\n\nPolitical Timing - Captain Fernán rides with orders to arrest the Infantes. Though this hasn't happened yet, some politically astute observers might sense coming instability.\n\nOverall Assessment:\n\nThe religious power of the relics and papal authority cannot be overstated in this era. Even politically cautious nobles must respect a papal crusade bull, especially after witnessing the True Cross. The Archbishop, as a church leader, would find it extremely difficult to oppose such clear papal commission.\n\nYou're not asking Barcelona to choose sides in Castilian politics - you're displaying papal relics and recruiting for a church-sanctioned crusade. That's much safer for people to support than political maneuvering.\n\nMaría's facilitation, your proven success in Florence, and the smart execution all point toward success. The complications are real but insufficient to prevent a positive outcome.\n\nI assess this action as: HIGH PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS\n\nPossible Outcomes:\n\nGreat Success:\n\nOverwhelming response rivaling or exceeding Florence\n\nSubstantial donations (30,000-50,000 florins)\n\n40-60 quality crusader recruits\n\nArchbishop of Zaragoza becomes active champion of your crusade\n\nMajor Catalan noble houses begin pledging support\n\nAlfonso V receives reports forcing him to acknowledge your legitimacy\n\nYour reputation in Aragon transformed\n\nSuccess:\n\nStrong turnout and genuine religious fervor\n\nSignificant donations (15,000-25,000 florins)\n\n20-35 quality recruits after filtering\n\nArchbishop impressed and supportive, willing to advocate to Consell Reial\n\nSeveral minor noble houses pledge support\n\nFoundation laid for broader Aragonese backing\n\nYour reputation enhanced in Catalonia\n\nFailure:\n\nModest turnout, political caution dominates religious enthusiasm\n\nLimited donations (5,000-10,000 florins)\n\n10-15 recruits, many of questionable quality\n\nArchbishop polite but noncommittal\n\nCatalan nobility remains neutral\n\nTime somewhat wasted, little progress made\n\nCatastrophic Failure:\n\nSomething goes wrong during display (theft attempt, riot, crowd accident)\n\nPolitical backlash from Alfonso's supporters who see this as Castilian manipulation\n\nArchbishop criticizes or opposes elements of your approach\n\nYour reputation damaged in Aragon as overreaching or politically naive\n\nInfantes' narrative about instability seems validated\n\nRecruitment and donations negligible\n\nPlease roll your dice and tell me the result: Great Success, Success, Failure, or Catastrophic Failure."

The cathedral display itself - religious fervor\n2. Archbishop of Zaragoza's reaction - critical for political support\n3. Donations pouring in - from various sources\n4. Quality crusader recruits - Rodrigo and Fray Hernando's filtering process\n5. Major Catalan noble houses beginning to commit\n6. Word reaching Alfonso in Naples\n7. The contrast with Infantes' failure to rally support\n8. María's role in facilitating\n9. Introduction of Isabel (the converso merchant's daughter) during this - she needs to appear naturally\n\nActually, I should also introduce Isabel during these events. She's the daughter of a wealthy Barcelona merchant (converso). This is a perfect opportunity - her family would definitely be involved in the crusade display and might make a donation. Juan could meet her at one of the events around the cathedral display or through María.\n\nLet me craft this carefully, showing the building momentum over several days, the religious and political impact, and naturally introducing Isabel.\n\nThe Barcelona Triumph - August 20-27, 1430\n\nDay One: August 20 - The Cathedral Display Begins\n\nThe morning dawns clear and warm. By the time you arrive at Barcelona Cathedral with your company, Rodrigo has done his work well. Wooden barriers have been erected in a large rectangle before the main altar, creating a sacred space perhaps twenty feet on each side. The white banner stands mounted on a sturdy pole inside this enclosure, the reliquaries gleaming in the light from the cathedral's high windows.\n\nGarcía, Marco, and two cathedral guards stand at the four corners of the barrier. Your other guards wait at the cathedral entrances, managing the crowd already forming.\n\nArchbishop Juan Martínez de Zaragoza arrived at dawn when Rodrigo sent word through María. He's perhaps fifty years old, lean and ascetic-looking, with intelligent eyes that miss nothing. He stands near the altar in full vestments, clearly moved by what he's seeing.\n\nThe Mass begins at the ninth hour. Perhaps 800 people pack the cathedral - more than it's seen in months for a regular morning Mass. The Bishop of Barcelona celebrates, with the Archbishop of Zaragoza concelebrating in a show of ecclesiastical unity.\n\nWhen the moment comes to display the relics, Fray Hernando steps forward. In clear Latin that echoes through the cathedral, then repeated in Catalan, then Castilian, he proclaims:\n\n\"Behold the fragment of the True Cross, upon which Our Lord Jesus Christ died for the sins of all mankind. Behold the bone of Santiago Matamoros, Saint James the Moor-slayer, patron of Spain, who guides Christian warriors to victory.\"\n\nThe congregation surges forward to see, then stops at the barriers. Many drop to their knees. Some weep openly. The sound of eight hundred people praying fills the vast space.\n\nAfter Mass, Fray Hernando and two cathedral priests take turns explaining the relics' significance, telling the story of your journey to Rome, your offering before Pope Martin V, the crusade bull's granting. They read key passages from the bull itself - the Pope's commission, the call to all Christians, the indulgences offered.\n\nThroughout the morning, people process slowly past the barriers, four or five deep, straining to see the reliquaries. Your guards maintain order firmly but respectfully. Anyone trying to climb the barrier is pushed back, but gently.\n\nArchbishop of Zaragoza spends an hour simply watching. You see him studying you, the relics, the crowd's reaction, the guards' discipline. Eventually he approaches where you stand to one side.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" he says quietly in cultured Castilian. \"I received Queen María's invitation to attend this morning. I confess I came partially from curiosity and partially from duty.\" He pauses. \"But I have witnessed something remarkable. The people's response is... genuine. Not manipulated, not theatrical. They believe.\"\n\nHe gestures toward the relics. \"And these are authentic. I can see the papal seals, the documentation. Cardinal Orsini's letter to me confirms everything.\" He meets your eyes. \"Pope Martin does not grant such commissions lightly. For him to give you the True Cross itself...\"\n\nYou spend an hour in private conversation with him in a side chapel. He asks probing questions about Rome, your motivations, your plans for the crusade. You're honest - about the political challenges, the religious purpose, the mixing of worldly necessity with spiritual calling.\n\n\"Most men would pretend otherwise,\" he says finally. \"Would claim pure piety while pursuing pure politics. Your honesty is... unusual for a king.\" He makes his decision. \"I will support your crusade before the Consell Reial. Not immediately - I must be politically careful - but I will advocate that Aragon should not hinder you, and should consider how we might assist.\"\n\nThat afternoon, donations begin. A table is set up near the cathedral entrance with Diego managing records. By evening: 3,800 florins, mostly in small amounts from common people - a few silver coins each, precious to those who give them.\n\nDay Two-Three: August 21-22 - Word Spreads\n\nBarcelona awakens to news of the display. By mid-morning on the 21st, the cathedral is packed beyond capacity. The city watch helps manage crowds that stretch into the plaza outside.\n\nRodrigo and Fray Hernando establish a system for those wanting to join the crusade. They set up in a side chapel:\n\nPhysical Assessment (Rodrigo with Sir Thomas and García):\n\nCan they ride? Basic horsemanship tested.\n\nCan they fight? Shown practice weapons, asked to demonstrate.\n\nAre they physically capable? Age, health, strength evaluated.\n\nDo they have resources? Can they equip themselves or need support?\n\nSpiritual Assessment (Fray Hernando):\n\nWhy do they want to join?\n\nConfession and discussion of faith\n\nUnderstanding of crusading vows\n\nAssessment of genuine commitment vs. adventure-seeking\n\nDay 21: Twenty-three men apply. After assessment, eight are presented to you as suitable. You accept six - two are too obviously seeking adventure rather than service.\n\nDay 22: Thirty-one men apply. Rodrigo rejects twelve immediately for being too old, too young, physically incapable, or obviously unsuitable. Fray Hernando speaks with nineteen. Nine are presented to you. You accept seven.\n\nMaría arranges for major merchant houses and noble families to attend the display. On the evening of August 22, she hosts a dinner at the royal palace. Forty guests - Barcelona's elite.\n\nYou're invited to speak. This time, you don't give a grand speech. Instead, you tell your story simply: the pilgrimage, the return for your father's sword, the discovery of betrayal, the journey to Rome, kneeling naked before the Pope. You describe the True Cross and Santiago's bone not as tools but as sacred charges that humble you daily.\n\nThe response is profound. Several merchants pledge major donations on the spot. Lorenzo Medina, a shipping magnate: 8,000 florins. The Wool Guild of Barcelona: provisions for 500 men for two months. Three minor noble families pledge smaller amounts totaling 5,000 florins.\n\nBut the evening's surprise comes from an unexpected source.\n\nAugust 22 Evening: Meeting Isabel\n\nDuring the dinner, María introduces you to several merchant families. Among them: Rodrigo Ruiz, a wealthy cloth merchant, his wife Juana, and their daughter Isabel.\n\nThe moment you see her, something shifts.\n\nIsabel is seventeen, with unusual auburn hair that catches the lamplight, pale skin with a dusting of freckles, and bright green eyes that seem to see straight through pretense. She wears a fine but modest gown in deep blue. When she curtsies, there's something both proper and slightly awkward about it - like she's learned the forms but isn't entirely comfortable with them.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" she says in clear Castilian with a Barcelona accent. \"My father has told me about your speech in Florence. He was there on business and heard you.\" She glances at her father, then back to you. \"He came home changed. He couldn't stop talking about the white banner and the cross and... and you.\"\n\nRodrigo Ruiz steps forward, a successful merchant perhaps forty-five years old, well-dressed but not ostentatious. \"Your Majesty, my family converted to Christianity three generations ago. We've worked hard to prove our faith, our loyalty, our place in Christian society.\"\n\nHis voice grows passionate. \"When I heard your speech in Florence - when you spoke about Christian virtue, about protecting even Muslims who surrender, about mercy and justice - I thought: this is what true Christianity means. Not just declaring faith, but living it.\"\n\nHe produces a letter of credit. \"Twenty thousand florins, Your Majesty. Half now, half when the crusade begins its march. This is everything my family can contribute. We want to be part of something holy.\"\n\nYou're stunned by the amount, but you find your eyes drawn back to Isabel. She's watching you with an intensity that's both disconcerting and compelling. Not the awed devotion of Pietro or the reverent distance of others - something more direct, more questioning.\n\n\"My father is generous,\" she says quietly. \"But Your Majesty, may I ask - do you truly mean what you said? About protecting Muslims who convert or surrender? About mercy?\" There's challenge in her voice, carefully delivered but real. \"Because many crusaders have said such things before, and then...\"\n\n\"Isabel,\" her mother says sharply, clearly mortified.\n\nBut you find yourself respecting the question. \"Yes,\" you say simply. \"I mean it. I've sworn it before God and before the True Cross itself. My crusaders take vows to uphold those principles.\"\n\nIsabel studies your face for a long moment, those green eyes searching. Then she nods slowly. \"I believe you,\" she says softly. \"I don't know why, but I do.\"\n\nThe conversation continues, but you're distracted. Isabel says little more - her parents do most of the talking - but you're intensely aware of her presence. The way she listens carefully to everyone. The slight furrow in her brow when something troubles her. How her eyes sometimes meet yours and then dart away.\n\nWhen the Ruiz family departs, she curtsies again. \"God bless your crusade, Your Majesty. I'll pray for your success.\" Simple words, but delivered with sincerity that makes them feel weighty.\n\nAfter they leave, María appears at your elbow. She's noticed something. Your sister knows you too well.\n\n\"The Ruiz family is converso,\" she says quietly. \"Very wealthy, very devout, but always proving themselves. Isabel is... unusual. Educated - her father paid for private tutors. She reads Latin, knows theology better than most priests. She questions everything.\" María pauses. \"Some find her difficult. Too bold, too questioning for a woman of her station.\"\n\nYou realize you're still watching the door where Isabel departed.\n\nMaría touches your arm gently. \"Hermano, be careful. She's a merchant's daughter, and converso besides. Any... attachment would be complicated.\"\n\nYou nod, not trusting yourself to speak. But Isabel's face stays in your mind.\n\nDays Four-Five: August 23-24 - Momentum Builds\n\nThe cathedral displays continue. Crowds remain large. By now, everyone in Barcelona and the surrounding countryside knows about the True Cross and Santiago's bone being displayed in their cathedral.\n\nDonations accelerate:\n\nAugust 23: 12,000 florins from various noble families and merchants\n\nAugust 24: 8,000 florins, including a surprising donation from the Barcelona Jewish community (500 florins with a note: \"For the protection of all peoples of the Book\")\n\nCrusader recruitment:\n\nAugust 23: Forty-one apply. After assessment, twelve presented, you accept nine.\n\nAugust 24: Fifty-three apply (word is spreading to countryside). After assessment, fifteen presented, you accept twelve.\n\nYour crusader company now numbers thirty-nine men beyond your original guards. Rodrigo organizes them into formations, begins serious training. García and Sir Thomas work daily with groups, teaching sword work, pike drill, horsemanship. Marco proves excellent as a training sergeant - he knows how to teach soldiers efficiently.\n\nFray Hernando is tireless. Daily confession sessions, group instruction in crusading principles, theological discussions. He's building exactly what you asked for - a spiritual culture within your forming army.\n\nOn August 24 evening, something unexpected happens. The Archbishop of Zaragoza requests private audience with you. In María's chambers, with only her present as witness, he speaks bluntly:\n\n\"Your Majesty, I've spent four days watching this. Watching you. Watching the people's response.\" He leans forward. \"The Consell Reial meets in two days. I will tell them that Aragon should support your crusade. Not with troops immediately - that requires more political negotiation. But with safe passage, with provisions, with tacit blessing.\"\n\nHe pauses. \"More than that - I will write to King Alfonso in Naples. I will tell him what I've witnessed. That you carry papal authority that cannot be questioned. That you've shown leadership, piety, and strategic thinking. That opposing you would mean opposing Rome.\"\n\nHis eyes are shrewd. \"I cannot promise what Alfonso will do. He's focused on Naples, and his brothers have his ear. But my word carries weight. This helps you, Your Majesty.\"\n\nYou realize this is the political breakthrough you needed in Aragon. The Archbishop of Zaragoza publicly supporting your crusade legitimizes it throughout Alfonso's realm.\n\nDays Six-Seven: August 25-27 - Major Commitments\n\nAugust 25: The Archbishop addresses the Consell Reial. Though you're not present (you're not a member), María hears everything afterward.\n\nThe Archbishop described your papal commission, the relics you carry, the crowds' genuine devotion, your careful screening of crusaders. He argued that Aragon should view your crusade as Spain's crusade, not just Castile's. That Granada threatens all Christian kingdoms. That opposing or hindering papal authority would be dangerous spiritually and politically.\n\nThe result: The Consell votes to:\n\nGrant you safe passage through Aragonese territory\n\nAllow recruitment in Aragon (those who join do so voluntarily)\n\nProvide favorable terms for supplies and provisions\n\nSend formal letter to Alfonso recommending he support the crusade\n\nNot everything you might want, but substantial progress.\n\nAugust 26: Three major Catalan noble families - the Montcadas, the Cervelló, and the Cardona - pledge formal support:\n\nCombined 15,000 florins in donations\n\nAgreement to allow their vassals to join crusade if they choose\n\nFuture military support to be negotiated (carefully worded to not commit fully yet)\n\nPere de Cardona, the Royal Chamberlain, requests private audience. \"Your Majesty, my family has watched you carefully. You're not what the Infantes described. My daughter Catalina...\" He pauses. \"She's one of Queen María's ladies. She's been attending the cathedral displays. She's been moved by what she's seen. She's asked if she might speak with you briefly.\"\n\nYou agree, curious. Catalina proves to be an intelligent, elegant woman of twenty who asks perceptive questions about your crusade's conduct, your commitment to mercy, how you'll maintain discipline. She's clearly assessing whether her family's support is wise. The conversation is professional, respectful, but you find yourself comparing her unfavorably to Isabel - Catalina is polished where Isabel is genuine, practiced where Isabel is spontaneous.\n\nAugust 27: Final day of the major display (though smaller displays will continue). The cathedral is packed for morning Mass. The Archbishop of Zaragoza preaches, speaking about divine providence, God's will made manifest, the call to holy service.\n\nAfter Mass, you address the assembled crowd yourself. Not a grand speech - a simple statement:\n\n\"I am Juan, King of Castile, servant of God, bearer of His holy relics. I march to Granada not for glory but for obedience. Not for conquest but for conversion. Join me if you feel called. Support with prayers and donations if you cannot come in person. And know that every act of service - great or small - is seen by God.\"\n\nThe response is overwhelming. People rush forward to pledge themselves, to donate, to touch the barriers near the relics. Your guards maintain order, but the fervor is palpable.\n\nFinal tallies for the week:\n\nDonations:\n\nNobles and major merchants: 68,000 florins\n\nCommon people and smaller sources: 14,000 florins\n\nTotal: 82,000 florins (more than four times annual Castilian royal revenue)\n\nCrusader Recruits:\n\nApplications: 248 men\n\nAfter assessment: 73 presented to you\n\nAccepted: 58 (plus your original 4, total 62 crusaders beyond your core guards)\n\nQuality Assessment (Rodrigo's report):\n\n12 are experienced soldiers or minor knights\n\n31 are competent fighters with basic training\n\n15 are raw but promising (like Andrea)\n\nAll have passed Fray Hernando's spiritual screening\n\nPolitical Achievements:\n\nArchbishop of Zaragoza actively supporting\n\nConsell Reial granted safe passage and support\n\nThree major Catalan families pledged backing\n\nLetter going to Alfonso V recommending support\n\nYour reputation in Aragon transformed from \"unstable young king\" to \"blessed crusader\"\n\nAugust 27 Evening: Private Moment\n\nAfter the exhausting day, you find yourself in María's private chambers. Your sister pours wine, and you sit together as family rather than king and queen.\n\n\"You've done something extraordinary, hermano,\" she says softly. \"In one week, you've accomplished what most kings couldn't do in months. Barcelona is yours. The Archbishop supports you. Even those who came skeptical have been won over.\"\n\nShe pauses, then adds with a slight smile: \"And you've attracted attention beyond just political support. Catalina de Cardona asked her father if a match might be considered. She's a good woman - educated, poised, politically valuable.\"\n\nYou nod absently, but your mind drifts to auburn hair and green eyes that ask difficult questions.\n\nMaría notices. She always notices. \"Or perhaps your thoughts lie elsewhere? With a certain merchant's daughter, maybe?\"\n\nYou look at her sharply. She shrugs. \"I saw how you looked at Isabel Ruiz at the dinner. And how she looked at you. And hermano...\" Her voice grows more serious. \"I understand. She's unusual, intelligent, genuine. But she's a converso merchant's daughter. Any relationship beyond friendship would be... extremely complicated politically.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hand. \"I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm saying be careful. You're doing so well. Don't let your heart create problems your crown doesn't need.\"\n\nYou know she's right. But you also know that Isabel's face won't leave your thoughts.\n\nStatus at End of Week (August 27, 1430)\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\nResources:\n\n82,000 florins in new donations (plus previous papal and Florence funds)\n\nSupplies and provisions pledged\n\nLetters of credit across Mediterranean\n\nMilitary:\n\n62 sworn crusaders (beyond core guard company)\n\nTraining ongoing under Rodrigo, García, Sir Thomas, and Marco\n\nArmor and equipment being procured\n\nPolitical:\n\nArchbishop of Zaragoza supporting\n\nAragonese safe passage granted\n\nMajor Catalan families pledged support\n\nYour reputation in Aragon dramatically improved\n\nLetter en route to Alfonso V in Naples\n\nPersonal:\n\nCaptain Fernán riding to Castile with arrest orders (should arrive early September)\n\nDeveloping feelings for Isabel Ruiz (complicated)\n\nSister María facilitating and supporting\n\nFray Hernando building spiritual culture in crusader company\n\nChallenges Ahead:\n\nMust decide sea vs. land route to Seville\n\nNeed intelligence on Granada's naval strength\n\nCaptain Fernán's mission may trigger civil war\n\nIsabel presents personal complication\n\nTime advancing toward November 8 Royal Council\n\nNext Decisions:\nYou've accomplished more than expected in Barcelona. Do you:\n\nStay longer to consolidate gains?\n\nBegin planning departure for Seville?\n\nAddress the Isabel situation somehow?\n\nFocus on other matters?\n\nWhat do you want to do?"

      "summary": "Juan is consumed by love for Isabel. His sister María arranges a tea meeting with Isabel and her mother, but Juan misreads Isabel's careful distance as rejection. María explains the reality: Isabel is a converso — she cannot have an affair with a king; it would mark her as a harlot. Juan realizes the only way to pursue her is marriage, which would be politically explosive. He experiences a crisis of certainty: his 'absolute certainty' about Isabel was wrong, leading him to question whether his other certainties (Rome, arrest orders) might also be wrong. In an honest conversation with Fray Hernando, Juan admits disappointment and shame, and asks Hernando to challenge him whenever that feeling of certainty strikes. He lets the arrest orders stand but with new humility.",

          "text": "María is 33, married for 15 years without children, isolated in Barcelona while her husband chases Italian ambitions. She's lonely but also politically sophisticated. She understands the complications but also might sympathize with her younger brother's first real romantic feelings.\n\nShe needs to:\n1. Acknowledge his feelings seriously (not dismiss them as youthful infatuation)\n2. Point out the complications clearly\n3. Perhaps find a middle path that allows some connection without immediate scandal\n4. Be sisterly - caring, protective, but also honest\n\nThe tone should be intimate, familial, with María both concerned and perhaps a bit knowing. She was 18 once too, though her marriage was arranged when she was even younger.\n\nMaría looks up from the letter she's been reading. You're in her private chambers - just the two of you, no attendants, no formality. When she sees your face, her expression softens immediately.\n\n\"Oh, hermano,\" she says gently, setting down the letter. She gestures for you to sit beside her on the cushioned bench near the window. \"Come. Sit with me.\"\n\nWhen you do, she takes your hand between both of hers - not as queen to king, but as older sister to younger brother.\n\n\"You're thinking about her,\" she says. Not a question. \"You haven't stopped thinking about her since the dinner three days ago.\"\n\nShe studies your face with eyes that have known loneliness and complicated feelings.\n\n\"Juan, I can arrange for Isabel to visit. Easily. I could invite her mother and her for tea, or ask Isabel to join my ladies for an afternoon. The Ruiz family would be honored by the invitation. Isabel would come.\" She pauses. \"But before I do, I need you to understand what you're walking into.\"\n\nShe shifts to face you more directly, her voice gentle but serious.\n\n\"Isabel is seventeen - only a year younger than you. She's intelligent, educated, genuine. I can see why you're drawn to her. She's not like the practiced court ladies who've been trained to flatter and flirt. She's real. She questions things. She sees you, not just your crown.\"\n\nMaría squeezes your hand.\n\n\"But hermano, she's a converso. Her grandfather was born Jewish, converted to save his family. There are people - many people - who will never see past that. Who will whisper that her family's Christianity is false, that they're secretly practicing Jewish rites, that they can never be truly Spanish or truly Christian.\"\n\nHer voice grows more urgent.\n\n\"And she's a merchant's daughter. Not nobility. If you... if anything developed between you, it would be seen as completely inappropriate. Kings marry for alliances, for political advantage, for bloodlines. They don't marry merchants' daughters, especially not converso merchants' daughters.\"\n\nShe releases one of your hands to touch your face gently.\n\n\"I'm not telling you not to feel what you feel. Feelings don't obey politics or propriety. God knows I understand that.\" There's something in her voice - old pain, perhaps, from her own arranged marriage at eighteen to a man who's now abandoned her for Italian dreams. \"I'm telling you that if you pursue this - even just spending time with her - you must be very, very careful.\"\n\nShe sits back slightly, thinking.\n\n\"Here's what I can do. I can invite Isabel and her mother for tea tomorrow afternoon. Casual, informal, with several of my other ladies present. You could... happen to visit me during that time. Completely innocent. We talk, we laugh, you get to know her better in a safe setting. Nothing scandalous, nothing that creates gossip.\"\n\nHer expression grows more calculating, not unkindly.\n\n\"Or, if you want something more direct - I could invite just Isabel, with the excuse that I'm curious about her education, want to meet this unusual young woman everyone's talking about. You could be present for part of that conversation. More private, but also more obvious what you're doing.\"\n\nShe searches your eyes.\n\n\"But Juan, you need to think about what you want from this. Is it just... wanting to see her again? To talk with someone who sees you as a person rather than a king? That I understand completely. Or is it something more? Because if it's more, if you're developing real feelings...\"\n\nShe doesn't finish the sentence, but her meaning is clear. Real feelings lead to impossible situations.\n\n\"Tell me what you're feeling, hermano. Not as your sister the queen who worries about politics. As María, who loves you and wants you to be happy. What is it about Isabel that won't leave your thoughts?\"\n\nShe waits, holding your hand, her expression open and caring. In this moment, she's not a queen managing Alfonso's court in his absence. She's your sister, offering guidance and understanding about matters of the heart.\n\nWhat do you tell her?"

          "text": "María would be understanding but also need to be careful here. She's:\n1. His older sister who cares about him\n2. Someone who's been in a loveless arranged marriage for 15 years\n3. Someone whose husband has abandoned her for Italy (and likely does have lovers there)\n4. A woman who understands desire and loneliness\n5. Also someone who knows the political realities and dangers\n\nShe would likely:\n- Not be shocked or judgmental\n- Acknowledge the reality that nobles and kings do have affairs\n- But distinguish between taking a mistress (common, accepted if discreet) and actually pursuing someone like Isabel\n- Warn him about the specific dangers with Isabel (converso family, could be seen as taking advantage, emotional complications)\n- Try to understand if this is just lust/loneliness or something deeper\n- Be honest about her own situation while maintaining some dignity\n- Guide him toward safer choices if this is just physical\n\nThis is a delicate moment that needs to respect both characters and the medieval context while also being honest about human nature.\n\nMaría's face goes through several emotions in quick succession - surprise, then something like pain, then understanding, then a deep sadness mixed with compassion. She's quiet for a long moment, looking down at your joined hands.\n\nWhen she finally speaks, her voice is soft and careful.\n\n\"Oh, Juan.\" She takes a shaky breath. \"You're asking me things that... that we're not supposed to talk about. That queens and kings pretend don't exist.\" She looks up at you, and her eyes are glistening. \"But yes. I'll be honest with you, because you deserve honesty.\"\n\nShe stands and walks to the window, looking out over Barcelona, her back to you. When she speaks again, her voice is thick with emotion.\n\n\"Yes, nobles have pleasures beyond what the public sees. Kings take mistresses - everyone knows it, no one speaks of it openly. Your own father had... arrangements. My husband Alfonso almost certainly has someone in Naples. Probably several someones.\" She laughs bitterly. \"Fifteen years married, and he's spent perhaps three of them actually in the same kingdom as me. Do you think he's been celibate all that time?\"\n\nShe turns back to face you, and you see tears on her cheeks.\n\n\"And yes, Juan, I have desires. I'm thirty-three years old. I was married at eighteen to a man I barely knew, did my duty in his bed for the few years he was actually present, and then he left for his Italian dreams and I haven't...\" She stops, wiping her eyes. \"I haven't been touched with affection in over a decade. So yes, I understand desire. I understand loneliness. I understand wanting someone to see you, to want you, not your crown or your political value.\"\n\nShe comes back to sit beside you, taking both your hands again.\n\n\"But hermano, there's a difference between what you're describing and what I think is actually happening to you.\" Her voice grows more serious. \"Kings taking mistresses - that's one thing. It's understood, it's discreet, it's usually with women who know the arrangement and accept it. A lady of the court, a widow, someone appropriate who understands this is physical pleasure, not love.\"\n\nShe searches your face.\n\n\"But Isabel... Juan, when you talk about her, you don't sound like a man who just wants to bed a pretty girl. You sound like someone who's falling in love. You said 'I am in love with her and want her' - love first, want second. That's not the same as desire alone.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hands.\n\n\"If this were just... physical need, just the desires of a young man who's been traveling for months focused on holy purpose and hasn't had any release - I could arrange something discreet. There are ways. Women who would be honored, who would be discreet, who understand these things. No one would judge you for that. Even Father Hernando would understand, even if he'd counsel against it.\"\n\nHer expression grows more intense.\n\n\"But Isabel is dangerous precisely because she's not that. She's a respectable merchant's daughter, converso, who would be ruined if you... if you pursued her and then walked away. If you just want her body, you'd be destroying her reputation, her marriage prospects, her family's standing - all for a few nights of pleasure. That's not just sinful, Juan, it's cruel.\"\n\nShe pauses, then continues more gently:\n\n\"And if you truly love her - if this is your heart, not just your body - then you're in even more dangerous territory. Because love makes people do foolish things. Love makes kings marry inappropriate women and tear their kingdoms apart. Love makes people ignore political reality and follow their hearts off a cliff.\"\n\nMaría wipes her eyes again.\n\n\"So I need you to tell me true, hermano. When you think about Isabel, what do you actually want? Do you want to bed her? Do you want her as a mistress? Do you want to court her properly? Do you imagine... God help us, do you imagine marrying her?\"\n\nShe looks at you with desperate concern.\n\n\"Because each of those is a different path with different consequences. If it's just desire - just youth and loneliness and attraction - we can address that safely. If it's real love... then we need to talk about what that would actually mean for you, for her, for your crusade, for everything you've built.\"\n\nShe touches your face gently.\n\n\"I'm not judging you, Juan. I'm trying to understand so I can help you. So tell me - when you imagine seeing Isabel again tomorrow, what do you imagine? What do you want to happen?\"\n\nHer eyes are kind but searching, waiting for you to be truly honest about what you're feeling.\n\nWhat do you tell her?"

          "text": "Juan is describing classic symptoms of infatuation - can't stop thinking about her, wants to see her, wants physical closeness (kissing, holding), wondering if it's love. This is very age-appropriate for an 18-year-old, especially one who's been focused on duty and religious purpose.\n\nMaría should be:\n1. Compassionate and understanding - not dismissive of his feelings\n2. Honest about what this might be (infatuation vs. deep love)\n3. Realistic about the complications\n4. Helpful in a way that protects both Juan and Isabel\n5. Perhaps sharing some of her own experience to help him understand\n\nShe should probably:\n- Acknowledge this sounds like it could be love, or at least the beginning of it\n- Explain that first love is powerful and real, even if it's new\n- Warn about the difference between the excitement of attraction and the depth of real love that develops over time\n- Help him understand that wanting to kiss and hold someone is normal and not inherently wrong\n- But also make clear that acting on those desires with Isabel specifically would have serious consequences\n- Offer to arrange a meeting where he can at least talk with her safely\n\nThis is a tender moment between siblings. María herself is lonely and understands longing, so she'll be empathetic.\n\nMaría's expression melts completely. She pulls you into an embrace, holding you tightly like she did when you were small and she was leaving for Barcelona all those years ago.\n\n\"Oh, hermano,\" she whispers. \"My sweet, earnest little brother.\"\n\nShe pulls back to look at your face, her hands on your shoulders, tears streaming down her cheeks but smiling through them.\n\n\"Yes, Juan. That sounds like love. Or at least the beginning of it.\" She touches your cheek tenderly. \"The not being able to stop thinking about her, wanting to arrange your whole life around the possibility of seeing her, imagining holding her and kissing her - that's what it feels like when your heart is caught.\"\n\nShe sits back down, pulling you with her, still holding your hands.\n\n\"I felt that way once, you know. Before I married Alfonso. There was a young knight at court in Valladolid - I was sixteen, he was nineteen. I thought about him constantly. Wondered where he'd be, tried to be where he was. Imagined what it would be like if he held my hand, if he kissed me.\" She smiles sadly. \"Then Father arranged my marriage to Alfonso for the alliance with Aragon, and I never saw that knight again. I don't even know if he felt anything for me, or if it was all just my young heart inventing romance.\"\n\nShe wipes her eyes.\n\n\"But Juan, here's what I've learned about love. What you're feeling right now - this overwhelming attraction, this obsession, this desire - that's real. It's powerful. It's intoxicating. But it's also...\" She searches for words. \"It's the spark, not the fire. It's how love begins, but it's not yet what love becomes.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hands.\n\n\"Real love - the kind that sustains a lifetime - requires knowing someone. Their flaws, their fears, their ordinary moments. The way they are when they're tired or angry or sick. Whether their character matches their appearance. Whether your hearts align beyond just attraction.\"\n\nHer voice grows more gentle.\n\n\"You've met Isabel once. You had a brief conversation at a dinner. You saw her intelligence, her genuineness, the way she looks at you. That's enough to catch your heart - clearly it has. But hermano, you don't know her yet. You don't know if this spark could become a fire, or if it would burn out once you knew each other better.\"\n\nShe pauses, then continues:\n\n\"And the desire you feel - wanting to kiss her, hold her - that's not wrong, Juan. That's not sinful in itself. That's how God made us. Men and women are meant to desire each other. Father Hernando would tell you to resist temptation, and he's right about that. But feeling the temptation? That's just being human. Being eighteen. Being alive.\"\n\nMaría's expression grows more serious.\n\n\"But here's the complication, and this is important: Isabel is not someone you can simply pursue for pleasure and then walk away from. She's a respectable young woman. If you... if you were alone with her, if you kissed her, if anything more happened - and people found out - she would be ruined. Her reputation destroyed. Her marriage prospects gone. Her family shamed.\"\n\nShe looks at you intently.\n\n\"Even if people didn't find out, you would have taken something from her that she can't get back - her innocence, her reputation in her own eyes, her ability to go to her eventual husband as a maiden. That has consequences for her whole life.\"\n\nShe softens again.\n\n\"So what I can do for you, hermano, is this: I will invite Isabel and her mother tomorrow afternoon for tea with several of my ladies. You can visit during that time - completely proper, nothing scandalous. You can talk with her. Get to know her better. See if this feeling is just the overwhelming attraction of a moment, or if there's something deeper there.\"\n\nShe tilts her head thoughtfully.\n\n\"And perhaps... if the afternoon goes well, if I see that she might feel something for you too... I could arrange for you to have a few moments of more private conversation. Not alone - that would be inappropriate and dangerous for her reputation. But perhaps a walk in the palace gardens with me and her mother nearby but out of earshot. Something where you could actually talk, really talk, and begin to know each other.\"\n\nHer voice drops to barely a whisper.\n\n\"But Juan, you must promise me - you must swear to me - that you will not try to kiss her or hold her unless you are prepared to make this something real. Something public. Something that acknowledges her as more than a passing desire. Because if you treat her as someone to secretly romance and then set aside, I will never forgive you. And you would deserve the guilt that would haunt you.\"\n\nShe searches your eyes.\n\n\"Can you promise me that? That you'll be careful with her heart, not just your own?\"\n\nShe pauses, then adds more softly:\n\n\"And hermano... you should also think about what this means for you. If you truly fall in love with Isabel, if she falls in love with you, what then? You're a king. You have a crusade to lead. You need political alliances. A marriage to a converso merchant's daughter would create enormous complications. I'm not saying it's impossible - love has toppled kingdoms and rewritten rules before. But you need to count that cost before you let your heart run away with you.\"\n\nShe cups your face in both hands.\n\n\"Tomorrow afternoon. I'll arrange it. You'll see her again. You can talk with her. And maybe we'll learn if this is the beginning of something real, or just the beautiful, painful ache of young attraction that will pass with time.\"\n\nShe kisses your forehead.\n\n\"Either way, I'm here. I'll help you navigate this. I promise.\"\n\nWhat do you say to your sister?"

You sound like you're fourteen years old preparing for your first dance at court.\" She's still smiling, wiping tears from her eyes, but this time they're tears of laughter mixed with tenderness. \"The King of Castile, blessed crusader who knelt naked before the Pope, commander of armies, asking his sister what to wear and what her favorite food is.\"\n\nShe pulls you into another embrace, laughing against your shoulder.\n\n\"This is wonderful. This is perfect. You're so...\" She pulls back to look at your face. \"You're so young and earnest and normal right now. Not the king carrying the True Cross. Just Juan, my little brother, nervous about seeing a girl he likes.\"\n\nShe composes herself somewhat, though she's still grinning.\n\n\"Alright, alright. Let me help you. Let's think through this properly.\"\n\nShe stands and begins pacing, her practical side engaging.\n\n\"What to wear:\"\n\n\"Not your white crusader garments. Those are for public displays, for religious moments. If you wear those, you're the blessed crusader, the untouchable holy king. You want her to see you.\" She considers. \"Something fine but not ostentatious. Your dark blue doublet with the silver threading - it's handsome, well-made, but not overwhelming. It makes you look...\" She smiles slightly. \"It makes you look like a young nobleman, not a crusading saint or a political force. Just a young man of quality.\"\n\nShe pauses. \"And for God's sake, make sure your hair is properly washed and combed. You've been training with the crusaders every morning - you can't show up smelling like horses and sweat.\"\n\n\"A gift:\"\n\nMaría's expression grows more thoughtful here.\n\n\"This is delicate. Too expensive or ostentatious a gift would be inappropriate - it would look like you're trying to buy her affection or flaunt your wealth. Too trivial would be insulting. And anything romantic - jewelry, personal items - would be completely improper at this stage.\"\n\nShe thinks for a moment.\n\n\"Books. Isabel is educated, her father paid for tutors. She reads Latin. A book would show you noticed something real about her, not just her appearance. Something theological perhaps, since you spoke about Christian virtue and she clearly cares about faith. Or...\" Her eyes light up. \"Poetry. Courtly poetry. Something about virtue and honor and... well, something that could be interpreted as appropriate either way.\"\n\nShe moves to a shelf and pulls down a small volume.\n\n\"This. Cancionero - a collection of Castilian poetry. Beautiful verses, properly bound, valuable but not extravagant. You could say you thought she might enjoy it given her education. Completely appropriate gift from a king to an intelligent young woman, but...\" She smiles knowingly. \"If she's clever - and she is - she'll understand that poetry is the language of courtship.\"\n\n\"Her favorite food:\"\n\nMaría laughs again. \"Hermano, I have no idea what her favorite food is. I met her at the same dinner you did - three days ago. I know she's educated and converso and questions everything, but I don't know if she prefers almond cakes or honey pastries.\"\n\nShe sits back down beside you.\n\n\"But here's what I can do. Tomorrow, I'll serve a variety of things at tea. Sweet cakes, fruit, honey pastries, some savory options. I'll watch what she reaches for, what she enjoys. And if the afternoon goes well, if I see that this might become something more than one meeting... I'll find out her preferences. Discreetly.\"\n\nHer expression becomes more serious, though still warm.\n\n\"But Juan, I need you to manage your expectations. Tomorrow afternoon, you'll see her. You'll talk with her. That's all. Don't imagine anything more dramatic happening. Don't build up fantasies of private moments or declarations of feeling. Just... see if you can have a real conversation. See if the attraction you feel is matched by any genuine connection.\"\n\nShe takes your hand again.\n\n\"And remember - she's seventeen, unmarried, from a respectable family. She'll be chaperoned by her mother and surrounded by my ladies. She cannot be forward or bold even if she wanted to be. You'll have to read subtle signs - how she looks at you, whether she engages in conversation beyond politeness, if she seems interested in seeing you again.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hand.\n\n\"Women of Isabel's station are trained from childhood to be modest, demure, appropriate. Even if she feels something for you - and we don't know that she does - she won't be able to show it openly. You'll have to be patient. Observant. Careful.\"\n\nMaría stands and pulls you to your feet.\n\n\"Now, it's late. You should sleep. Tomorrow morning, have your servants prepare your blue doublet. Wash thoroughly - and I mean thoroughly. I'll have the poetry book wrapped appropriately. The tea will be at the second hour after noon. You'll 'happen' to visit me perhaps a quarter hour after the ladies arrive - long enough that it's not too obvious, but not so long that you miss most of the afternoon.\"\n\nShe walks you toward the door, then stops and turns back.\n\n\"Juan... one more thing. When you see her tomorrow, try to actually listen to what she says, not just gaze at her adoringly like a lovesick puppy.\" She's smiling but serious. \"Ask her questions. About her education, her thoughts on theology, what books she's read, what she thinks about things. Get to know her mind, not just her face.\"\n\nShe touches your cheek gently.\n\n\"Because if this is going to be real - if it's going to be more than just infatuation - you need to know who she actually is. And she needs to know you. Not the crusader king, but Juan. The young man who questions his own certainty, who struggles with faith and pride, who cares deeply about doing right. Show her that person.\"\n\nShe kisses your forehead.\n\n\"Now go. Rest. Dream of auburn hair and green eyes if you must. But tomorrow, be present. Be genuine. Be yourself.\"\n\nShe opens the door, then calls after you as you leave:\n\n\"And hermano? Try not to look too eager when you arrive. A little dignity, please. You're still a king.\"\n\nBut she's smiling as she says it.\n\nThe night passes. Morning comes. You have the day until the afternoon tea.\n\nWhat do you do to prepare? And when the time comes, how do you want to approach the meeting?"

          "text": "The Afternoon Tea - August 28, 1430\n\nThe afternoon is warm and pleasant. María has arranged the gathering in her private garden chamber - a beautiful room that opens onto a small courtyard with flowering plants and a fountain. The sound of water trickling provides gentle background music.\n\nYou've spent the morning in an agony of preparation. Your servants were bemused by your insistence on washing thoroughly, combing your hair multiple times, adjusting your doublet. Fray Hernando noticed your nervous energy during morning prayers and gave you a knowing look but said nothing. Rodrigo mentioned you seemed \"distracted\" when reviewing the crusaders' training reports.\n\nNow, at the appointed time, you stand outside María's chamber with the wrapped poetry book in your hands. Your heart pounds. You've faced down hostile nobles, knelt naked before the Pope, proclaimed crusade before thousands - but this feels more terrifying somehow.\n\nYou wait. A quarter hour, as María instructed. It feels like an eternity.\n\nFinally, you knock and enter.\n\nThe scene that greets you is one of elegant femininity. Six women sit in a loose circle on cushioned chairs around a low table laden with refreshments - honey cakes, almond pastries, fresh fruit, delicate cups of spiced wine and herbal tea.\n\nMaría sees you first and stands with perfect theatrical surprise. \"Your Majesty! How delightful. I wasn't expecting you this afternoon.\" Her eyes dance with barely suppressed amusement at the obvious fiction.\n\nThe other women rise and curtsy as one. Your eyes find Isabel immediately.\n\nShe's wearing a gown of deep green that makes her auburn hair seem to catch fire in the afternoon light streaming through the windows. Her pale skin shows a faint blush - whether from the warmth of the afternoon or your entrance, you can't tell. Those green eyes widen slightly when she sees you, and something flickers across her face too quickly to read.\n\nJuana Ruiz, Isabel's mother, is perhaps forty, handsome rather than beautiful, with shrewd eyes that assess you carefully. She curtsies deeply. \"Your Majesty. What an honor.\"\n\nThe other ladies are three of María's regular companions - you recognize them vaguely from court but their names escape you in your current state of nervous focus.\n\n\"Please, ladies, sit,\" you say, trying to sound casual. \"I don't wish to interrupt. I was merely...\" You flounder slightly. What's your excuse for being here?\n\nMaría saves you smoothly. \"His Majesty has been so focused on the crusade preparations, I insisted he take an afternoon to rest. I thought he might enjoy some civilized company after all those soldiers and training grounds.\" She gestures to an empty chair near her own - which happens to be positioned where you'll be able to see Isabel easily. \"Please, join us, hermano. We're just discussing poetry, actually.\"\n\nYou sit, hyperaware of Isabel's presence across the small circle. She's looking at her hands folded in her lap, the picture of modest propriety, but you catch her glancing up at you once, quickly, before looking away again.\n\nOne of María's ladies - a woman named Leonor - speaks up. \"Her Majesty was just telling us about some Castilian poets. Lady Isabel was mentioning she's read some Latin poetry.\"\n\nIsabel speaks for the first time, her voice soft but clear. \"Just a little, my lady. My tutor thought I should understand the classics. Though I confess I find the meaning sometimes escapes me.\" She glances at you again, briefly. \"The language is beautiful even when I don't fully grasp the intent.\"\n\nYou realize you're staring and force yourself to look away, accepting a cup of wine from a servant.\n\nMaría, bless her, creates an opening. \"His Majesty has an excellent education in such matters. Juan, didn't you study under that Dominican scholar in Salamanca for a time?\"\n\nYou clear your throat. \"Yes, Brother Alfonso. He was... very thorough.\" You look at Isabel. \"What poets have you read, Lady Isabel?\"\n\nShe meets your eyes now, just for a moment, and you see something there - nervousness matching your own, perhaps? \"Ovid, mostly, Your Majesty. The Metamorphoses. Stories of transformation, gods becoming mortals, mortals becoming something else entirely.\" A slight pause. \"I found it fascinating how easily the boundaries between different states of being could be crossed in those stories.\"\n\nIs there meaning in that choice? You're not sure.\n\n\"And what did your tutor say about the moral lessons?\" you ask, genuinely curious now, trying to follow María's advice to listen and ask questions.\n\nIsabel's face becomes more animated. \"That's what I found most interesting, Your Majesty. My tutor - Father García, a very learned Franciscan - said the pagan poets were actually expressing Christian truths without knowing it. That transformation and change were always possible through grace, even if they used the language of mythology.\"\n\nHer mother Juana interjects gently: \"Isabel has always been curious about such matters. Perhaps too curious sometimes.\" But she's smiling fondly.\n\nYou find yourself leaning forward. \"I don't think one can be too curious about truth, Lady Juana. Even when it appears in unexpected forms.\"\n\nIsabel's eyes light up at this. \"Exactly! That's what I've always thought. Truth is truth, wherever you find it.\" Then she catches herself, as if remembering she's supposed to be demure. \"Though of course, the clearest truth is in Scripture and Church teaching.\"\n\nThe conversation flows from there, but you're barely aware of the other women. You and Isabel keep returning to each other, finding points of connection. She mentions reading about the lives of saints, and you tell her about your favorite - Saint Martin of Tours, who cut his cloak in half for a beggar. She asks if that's who you're named after, and you admit you don't know, you've never asked.\n\nAn hour passes. The light shifts in the garden courtyard outside. You've almost forgotten to be nervous.\n\nThen María stands. \"Ladies, shall we take a turn in the garden? The fountain is particularly lovely this time of day, and I want to show you the roses that just bloomed.\"\n\nThe women rise. You stand as well, and as the group begins moving toward the courtyard, you catch María's eye. She gives you the tiniest nod, then deliberately engages Juana Ruiz in conversation, drawing her toward the far side of the garden where the roses grow.\n\nThe other ladies drift away as well, admiring flowers, examining the fountain's stonework. It's all perfectly innocent - everyone is still visible to everyone else. But suddenly you and Isabel are standing near each other with no one immediately beside you, the noise of the fountain covering quiet conversation.\n\nYour heart hammers. You remember the book in your hand - you've been holding it the entire time like a fool.\n\n\"Lady Isabel,\" you say quietly. \"I... I brought something. For you.\" You hold out the wrapped volume. \"Your father mentioned your education, and you spoke about poetry. I thought... I thought you might enjoy this.\"\n\nShe looks at the book, then up at you, those green eyes wide with surprise. \"Your Majesty, I couldn't possibly—\"\n\n\"Please,\" you say. \"It's just a book. A collection of Castilian poetry. Nothing...\" You fumble for words. \"Nothing inappropriate. Just something I thought an educated woman might appreciate.\"\n\nShe takes it carefully, unwrapping it enough to see the binding. Her fingers trace the leather cover reverently. \"It's beautiful,\" she whispers. Then she looks up at you, and for just a moment, her modest mask slips. You see genuine feeling there - gratitude, confusion, something deeper she's not sure how to name.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" she says quietly, barely audible over the fountain. \"Why are you doing this?\"\n\n\"Doing what?\" Your mouth is dry.\n\n\"This.\" She gestures helplessly at the book, at the garden, at the situation. \"Being here. Bringing me gifts. I'm just... I'm a merchant's daughter. You're...\" She can't finish.\n\nYou step slightly closer, not touching, just close enough that no one else could hear. \"I wanted to see you again,\" you say simply, honestly. \"Since the dinner, I haven't been able to stop thinking about—\" You stop yourself. Too much, too fast. \"About our conversation. About what you said about mercy and justice and truth.\"\n\nShe's blushing deeply now. \"Your Majesty, I...\" She looks down at the book. \"I don't know what to say.\"\n\n\"Say you'll keep the book,\" you murmur. \"Say I can...\" What? You don't even know what you're asking for. \"Say I can see you again. To talk. About poetry or theology or... anything.\"\n\nIsabel is silent for a long moment, her face a mixture of emotions you can't quite read. Finally, very quietly: \"Your Majesty, I'm not...\" She struggles. \"I'm not someone you should be interested in. My family is converso. People whisper about us. And I'm not noble, I'm not...\"\n\n\"I don't care about that,\" you say, and you realize it's true. In this moment, you genuinely don't care about the political complications.\n\nShe looks up at you, and there are tears in her eyes now. \"But you should care, Your Majesty. You're a king. You have a crusade to lead. I'm...\" Her voice drops to barely a whisper. \"I'm nobody. And if people see you paying attention to me, they'll say terrible things. About both of us.\"\n\nBefore you can respond, María's voice calls from the roses: \"Your Majesty! Come see these blooms, they're extraordinary!\"\n\nThe moment shatters. Isabel steps back quickly, clutching the book to her chest. She curtsies deeply, her face averted. \"Thank you for the gift, Your Majesty. It's... it's very generous.\"\n\nWhen she looks up again, the modest mask is back in place, but her eyes are still wet.\n\nThe tea concludes shortly after. The ladies depart, chaperoned and proper. Juana Ruiz thanks María profusely for the invitation. Isabel curtsies to you again, murmurs \"Your Majesty,\" and then she's gone, the book wrapped carefully in cloth under her arm.\n\nWhen everyone has left, María takes your arm and walks you back to her chambers.\n\n\"Well?\" she asks quietly. \"How do you feel?\"\n\nWhat do you say to your sister? And what do you make of Isabel's reaction?"

          "text": "Oh no, Juan is misinterpreting Isabel's response. This is a classic case of a young person (he's 18) not understanding the complexities of the situation. Isabel clearly has feelings for him - the tears, the emotion, the way she looked at him - but she's also being realistic and protecting both of them from scandal.\n\nMaría needs to provide the older sister wisdom here. She needs to explain that:\n1. Isabel's reaction shows she DOES have feelings - if she didn't care, she would have just accepted the gift politely and moved on\n2. Isabel is being protective of Juan and herself by pointing out the complications\n3. This is actually a sign of maturity and genuine care, not rejection\n4. The tears, the emotional response - these show she's affected by him\n\nMaría should be gentle but firm here. She shouldn't let Juan spiral into self-pity or give up too easily. She should help him understand what just happened from a woman's perspective, especially a woman in Isabel's complicated position.\n\nThis is also a teaching moment about how women in this era have to navigate very carefully - they can't just express their feelings openly, especially not to a king. Isabel has to protect her reputation, her family's reputation, and also genuinely cares about not damaging Juan's political position.\n\nMaría should probably also point out that Juan is being somewhat dramatic and self-pitying here, which is very 18-year-old of him.\n\nMaría stops walking and turns to face you, gripping both your arms firmly. Her expression is somewhere between exasperation and affection.\n\n\"Juan. Stop. Listen to me.\"\n\nShe pulls you to sit on a bench in the corridor, then sits beside you, not letting go of your arm.\n\n\"Hermano, you are being dramatic and blind and very, very eighteen years old right now.\" Her voice is gentle but firm. \"Did you see the same thing I just saw?\"\n\nYou start to protest, but she holds up a hand.\n\n\"That girl - that young woman - was in tears, Juan. Tears. Not because she doesn't want you. Because she does, and it terrifies her.\"\n\nShe squeezes your arm.\n\n\"If Isabel didn't care about you, if she felt nothing, do you know what she would have done? She would have accepted your gift with a polite smile, thanked you prettily, made appropriate small talk, and forgotten about you the moment she left. That's what women do when a man they're not interested in pays attention to them.\"\n\nMaría's voice grows more intense.\n\n\"But that's not what happened. She got emotional. She tried to push you away. She told you all the reasons why you shouldn't be interested in her - she's converso, she's nobody, people will say terrible things. Juan, do you understand what that means?\"\n\nShe turns your face to look at her.\n\n\"It means she's already thinking about what a relationship with you would mean. She's already imagining it, worrying about it, trying to protect you - and herself - from the consequences. Women don't do that about men they don't care about. They only do that when they're already feeling something and trying to be sensible about it.\"\n\nShe releases your face but keeps hold of your hand.\n\n\"And the tears, hermano. She had tears in her eyes. That's not indifference. That's someone who wants something she thinks she can't have. That's someone who's already feeling more than she should and is trying to be responsible about it.\"\n\nMaría stands and pulls you up with her, walking you back toward her chambers.\n\n\"Let me explain something about women in Isabel's position - and honestly, about women in general in our world. We can't just... say what we feel. Not directly. Especially not to a king. Especially not when we're from families that are already watched and judged.\"\n\nShe continues as you walk:\n\n\"Isabel knows - because she's intelligent and has been raised to understand these things - that if she shows interest in you, if she encourages your attention, she risks everything. Her reputation could be destroyed by gossip. Her family could be accused of social climbing or using her to manipulate you. People would say terrible things - that she seduced you, that her family planned it, that they're trying to marry above their station.\"\n\nYou enter her chambers and she pours wine for both of you.\n\n\"And more than that, Juan - I think she genuinely cares about you. About your crusade, your reputation, your political position. When she said 'you're a king, you have a crusade to lead, you shouldn't be interested in me' - that wasn't rejection. That was her trying to protect you from making a mistake she thinks would hurt you.\"\n\nShe hands you the wine.\n\n\"That's what love looks like, hermano. Not just wanting someone, but caring about their wellbeing enough to push them away if you think you'll damage them.\"\n\nShe sits beside you.\n\n\"So no, she didn't say 'I want you too, let's pursue this openly.' Because she can't say that. Society doesn't let her. Her position doesn't allow it. And her genuine care for you and her family makes her try to be sensible even when her heart is pulling her toward you.\"\n\nMaría's expression softens completely.\n\n\"Juan, you're not a fool. You saw something real between you. The conversation flowed naturally, she lit up when talking with you, you connected on ideas and thoughts. That was genuine. And her emotional reaction afterward? That was genuine too. She's feeling something, and it scares her because of all the complications.\"\n\nShe pauses, then adds:\n\n\"The question isn't whether she wants you. I think she does, or at least she's beginning to. The question is: what do you do about it? Because she's right about the complications. They're real. This would be difficult, potentially scandalous, politically complicated.\"\n\nShe looks at you seriously.\n\n\"So you need to decide. Was this just... wanting to see her again because you were infatuated? If so, then yes, let it go. It would be kinder to her to not pursue something you're not serious about. But if this is something more - if you felt a real connection, if you think this might be the beginning of actual love - then you don't give up after one difficult conversation.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hand.\n\n\"Real courtship, real love - it's not easy, Juan. It's not like the romances where the knight and the lady fall into each other's arms. It's complicated and requires patience and navigating obstacles. And sometimes it requires showing someone that you're serious, that you're willing to work through the complications, that they're worth it to you.\"\n\nShe tilts her head.\n\n\"So tell me true - now that you've spent time with her, now that you've talked and seen her reaction - what do you actually feel? Was it just attraction that's now disappointed? Or is it something more?\"\n\nShe waits, watching your face carefully.\n\nWhat do you tell your sister?"

Present the full complexity of the situation\n4. Perhaps share her own experience with duty vs. heart\n5. Not push him either way, but help him think it through completely\n\nShe might point out:\n- Kings do marry for love sometimes, even when politically inconvenient\n- His father had arrangements beyond his marriage\n- The question of what kind of king/man he wants to be\n- Whether his \"purpose\" is really so clear-cut\n- The cost of always putting duty first (she knows this personally)\n- But also acknowledge the validity of his concerns\n\nThis is a crossroads moment. María should be wise, loving, and honest - not pushing him toward Isabel, but making sure he's thought through all the implications of walking away too.\n\nMaría is silent for a long moment. She sets down her wine, stands, and walks to the window. When she speaks, her voice is quiet and carries the weight of years of experience you don't have yet.\n\n\"You sound so certain. So resolved.\" She doesn't turn around. \"You've decided that duty must override everything else. That your purpose - uniting Spain, serving God - is more important than love. That you must marry strategically or not at all.\"\n\nShe finally turns to face you, and there are tears on her cheeks.\n\n\"Do you know what I hear when you say that, hermano? I hear myself fifteen years ago. When Father told me I would marry Alfonso of Aragon for the alliance. When I stood in a room not unlike this one and told myself that duty was more important than the young knight I'd been dreaming about. That a princess doesn't marry for love. That my purpose was to serve my family and my kingdom.\"\n\nShe comes back to sit beside you.\n\n\"And you know what? I was right. I did my duty. I married Alfonso. I helped secure the alliance between Castile and Aragon. I've been a good queen. I've fulfilled my purpose.\" Her voice breaks slightly. \"And I've been alone for ten years while my husband chases Italian dreams. I've spent a decade in a loveless marriage, childless, useful only as a symbol. I did the right thing, the dutiful thing.\"\n\nShe wipes her eyes.\n\n\"I'm not saying I regret it. I made my choice and I live with it. But Juan, when you say 'better to cut it all off sooner and save her pain' - whose pain are you really trying to save? Hers? Or yours?\"\n\nShe takes your hand.\n\n\"Because here's what I've learned, hermano. Duty is real. Purpose is real. But so is the cost of always choosing duty over heart. You can be the perfect king - strategic, calculating, marrying for alliances, never letting personal feelings complicate your mission. But you'll also be...\" She gestures at herself. \"This. Alone. Going through the motions. Remembering what might have been.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hand hard.\n\n\"Now, let me be clear - I'm not saying you're wrong. The complications with Isabel are real. A converso merchant's daughter is not a strategic marriage. Your nobles would resist. Some would be scandalized. It could create real political problems at a time when you need unity for your crusade.\"\n\nHer voice grows more intense.\n\n\"But Juan, you're also making assumptions that might not be true. You say you 'already know' that purpose is more powerful than anything, even love. Do you? Have you actually tested that? Or are you afraid to find out?\"\n\nShe leans closer.\n\n\"And you say you must marry strategically. Must you? Your father married for alliance, yes, but he also had deep affection for your mother. Some kings marry for pure strategy. Others marry where heart and duty align. A few even marry for love despite complications, and make it work.\"\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\"You're eighteen years old, Juan. You have years before you need to marry. The crusade will take a decade or more. You don't have to decide right now between Isabel and strategic marriage. You could... see where this goes. Carefully. Slowly. Maybe it burns out on its own. Maybe you discover she's not who you imagined. Maybe the complications prove insurmountable.\"\n\nHer expression softens.\n\n\"Or maybe - and I'm just saying maybe - you find that this is real, and deep, and worth fighting for. And maybe when that time comes, you'll have to choose. But why make that choice now, before you even know what you're choosing between?\"\n\nShe releases your hand and sits back.\n\n\"You say 'if we can never marry, we can never love each other.' But hermano, that's not how hearts work. Love doesn't wait for permission. It doesn't check political calculations first. You already love her - you said so yourself. Cutting her off now doesn't erase that. It just means you both suffer the loss without ever knowing if it could have been something real.\"\n\nMaría's voice drops to barely a whisper.\n\n\"And there's one more thing you need to consider. You talk about your purpose - uniting Spain, serving God, leading the crusade. That's beautiful. That's noble. But Juan...\" She looks at you with devastating honesty. \"What kind of king do you want to be? The kind who always puts duty first and becomes hard and calculating? Or the kind who fights to find a way to honor both duty and heart? The kind who shows mercy even when it's inconvenient?\"\n\nShe touches your face gently.\n\n\"Because you told Isabel at that dinner - you promised in your crusading oaths - that you would show mercy, protect the vulnerable, fight for justice even when it's difficult. But if you can't show that same mercy and courage in your own life... if you won't fight for what matters to you personally... how will you have the strength to enforce those principles in your army?\"\n\nShe pulls back.\n\n\"I'm not telling you what to do, Juan. This is your life, your heart, your kingdom. If you genuinely believe that walking away now is the right choice - that it serves her better and serves your mission better - then do it. Make that choice with clear eyes.\"\n\nHer voice becomes firmer.\n\n\"But don't fool yourself that it's selfless. Don't tell yourself you're 'saving her pain' when you're also saving yourself from having to navigate something difficult. Don't convince yourself that duty demands you cut this off when really you're just afraid - afraid of the complications, afraid of what your nobles will say, afraid of having to fight for something that doesn't fit neatly into your plans.\"\n\nShe stands and walks to her desk, pulls out a piece of parchment.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I think you should do. Not what you must do - what I think would be wise.\"\n\nShe turns back to you.\n\n\"Send her a letter. Through me, so it's properly chaperoned. A simple letter thanking her for the conversation, saying you valued meeting someone who thinks deeply about faith and truth. Nothing romantic. Nothing inappropriate. Just... keeping the door open. Being honest that you enjoyed speaking with her and would welcome the chance to do so again.\"\n\nShe holds up the parchment.\n\n\"And then you wait. You focus on your crusade preparation. You finish your business in Barcelona. You return to Seville for your Royal Council. You have months of work ahead before you need to make any decisions about marriage or love or any of this.\"\n\nHer expression softens.\n\n\"But don't slam the door shut today out of fear or duty or noble self-sacrifice. Give this time. Give yourself permission to feel what you feel. Give her the same. And see what happens. Maybe in a few months you'll realize it was just infatuation and you're glad you didn't pursue it. Maybe you'll meet someone else and Isabel will become a sweet memory. Or maybe...\"\n\nShe doesn't finish, but her meaning is clear.\n\n\"What do you think, hermano? Are you truly certain you want to cut this off now? Or are you afraid, and calling that fear duty?\"\n\nShe waits, holding the parchment, watching you with eyes full of love and concern.\n\nWhat do you decide?"

Recognizing this side of him - the absolute certainty that Fray Hernando has warned about\n4. Concerned about Isabel being hurt\n5. Perhaps frustrated that he won't listen\n\nBut she's also his sister and she loves him. She'll arrange what he asks even if she disagrees.\n\nThis is Juan choosing duty/purpose over love, but in a way that might actually be more hurtful - he's going to tell Isabel everything rather than just quietly letting it fade. That's either very honest and respectful, or potentially cruel depending on how it's handled.\n\nFray Hernando being present is interesting - Juan wants spiritual authority there, perhaps to help him stay strong, or perhaps to validate his choice as the right one.\n\nMaría's response should show her hurt, her worry, but also her recognition that when Juan is in this state, he cannot be moved.\n\nMaría stands very still, the parchment hanging forgotten in her hand. For a long moment she just looks at you, and you see a dozen emotions cross her face - hurt, worry, frustration, resignation, and beneath it all, love mixed with something that might be fear.\n\nWhen she speaks, her voice is carefully controlled, but you can hear the pain underneath.\n\n\"I see.\" She sets the parchment down slowly. \"You're right. We have been apart a long time. I remember a little boy who left for pilgrimage, and a king returned. Perhaps I don't know this version of you - the one filled with absolute certainty, unmovable by anything or anyone.\"\n\nShe walks back to the window, her back to you.\n\n\"I've heard about these moments of yours. From the letters, from the reports. When you feel called to something and nothing can sway you. When you stripped naked before the Pope. When you ordered the Infantes arrested despite all advice against it. And now this.\"\n\nShe turns slightly, enough to see your profile.\n\n\"Fray Hernando warns you about this certainty. About the danger of confusing your will with God's will. But you don't believe you're doing that, do you? You believe this IS right. That cutting Isabel off, telling her 'everything,' making this sacrifice - that this is what God's purpose demands.\"\n\nHer voice breaks slightly.\n\n\"And maybe you're right. Maybe I'm the fool, thinking that love and duty can coexist. Maybe I'm projecting my own regrets onto you. Maybe your certainty IS divine guidance and I'm too wounded by my own choices to see it.\"\n\nShe comes back to face you, and her eyes are wet but her expression is composed.\n\n\"I will arrange it. Tomorrow at the eleventh hour. Isabel and her mother, you, me, and Father Hernando. A private audience.\" She pauses. \"Though I warn you, hermano - if you're going to tell that girl you love her and then tell her you can never be together because duty demands it... that's not kindness. That's not mercy. That's giving her a wound that will take years to heal.\"\n\nShe touches your arm gently.\n\n\"But I understand. Your mind is made up. Nothing I say will change it. So I'll do what you ask, because I'm your sister and I love you, even when I think you're making a terrible mistake.\"\n\nShe walks you to the door, then stops you with a hand on your shoulder.\n\n\"Juan... I have one request. Just one. When you're there tomorrow, before you speak to Isabel - look at Father Hernando. Really look at him. See if he approves of what you're about to do. See if his face shows that this is God's will, or if he looks troubled.\"\n\nHer voice drops to a whisper.\n\n\"Because if even your confessor - who warns you about worldly temptation and counsels purity - looks uncomfortable with what you're doing... maybe that should tell you something.\"\n\nShe kisses your forehead.\n\n\"Sleep well, hermano. I'll send word to the Ruiz family first thing in the morning. They'll be honored by the royal summons, even if they don't yet know what it means.\"\n\nShe opens the door for you.\n\n\"And Juan? I pray you're right. I pray this certainty of yours IS God's will, and not just a young king too afraid to fight for something that doesn't fit neatly into his plans. Because if you're wrong...\"\n\nShe doesn't finish. She just closes the door quietly behind you.\n\nYou're alone in the corridor. The evening is settling over Barcelona. Tomorrow at the eleventh hour, you'll tell Isabel everything - that you love her, and that you can never be with her.\n\nThe certainty you felt when you told María fills you still. This is right. This is necessary. Sacrifice for the greater purpose.\n\nBut as you walk back to your chambers, you can't quite shake María's words: \"That's giving her a wound that will take years to heal.\"\n\nThe night passes. Morning comes.\n\nWhat do you do to prepare for the meeting? And when the time arrives, how do you want to approach this conversation?"

          "text": "Juan is seeking out Fray Hernando late in the evening after his conversation with María. This is significant - he's turning to his spiritual advisor after making this decision about Isabel. Let me think about where Fray Hernando would be and how he would respond.\n\nFray Hernando has been extremely busy with the crusader recruitment - hearing confessions, providing spiritual guidance, building the spiritual culture Juan asked for. He's likely exhausted but would always make time for Juan.\n\nJuan is coming to him with certainty - he's made up his mind to end things with Isabel before they truly begin. But María specifically suggested Juan look at Fray Hernando's reaction tomorrow to see if he approves. This is interesting - even María, who might normally expect the confessor to counsel against romance, suspects Fray Hernando might be troubled by Juan's approach.\n\nFray Hernando has consistently warned Juan about:\n1. Confusing his own will with God's will\n2. Certainty becoming pride\n3. Using spiritual language to justify calculated decisions\n4. The danger of treating everything as if it has divine sanction\n\nBut he's also shown himself to be surprisingly understanding of human complexity. He was moved by Juan's offering before the Pope. He's not a harsh moralist - he's someone who genuinely cares about Juan's spiritual wellbeing.\n\nHow would Fray Hernando respond to Juan saying he's decided to tell Isabel he loves her but can never be with her because duty demands it?\n\nI think Fray Hernando would be troubled. Not because he wants Juan to pursue romance over duty - but because:\n1. The certainty again - Juan is \"absolutely certain\" this is God's will\n2. The cruelty of the approach - telling someone you love them just to say you can't be with them\n3. The potential spiritual pride in making a grand gesture of sacrifice\n4. The question of whether this is really about protecting Isabel or protecting Juan from difficulty\n\nFray Hernando would probably probe gently, ask questions, try to understand Juan's reasoning, and express concerns without directly ordering Juan to do differently.\n\nYou find Fray Hernando in the small chapel attached to the palace. It's late evening, and he's alone, kneeling before the altar. Several candles burn, casting flickering shadows across the stone walls. He's still wearing his habit from the day - no doubt he's been hearing confessions and counseling the new crusaders since morning.\n\nHe doesn't turn when you enter, but after a moment he crosses himself, rises from his knees with the slight stiffness of a man who's been kneeling too long, and turns to face you.\n\n\"Your Majesty.\" His weathered face shows exhaustion, but his eyes are alert, kind. \"Of course. Always.\"\n\nHe gestures to a bench along the wall, and you both sit. The chapel is quiet except for the faint sound of wind outside and the occasional pop of candle wax.\n\n\"You look troubled,\" he says gently. \"What weighs on you?\"\n\nThe candles flicker, casting moving shadows across his face. He waits patiently, hands folded in his lap, giving you his complete attention despite his obvious weariness.\n\nWhat do you tell him?"

He came to talk to his confessor about something important but is starting with small talk about Hernando's workload. This could be nervousness, avoidance, or genuine concern. Probably a mix.\n\nFray Hernando is perceptive. He'll answer the question but also gently push Juan toward what he really wants to discuss.\n\nFray Hernando's expression softens with both gratitude and gentle amusement. He recognizes deflection when he sees it, but he answers your question earnestly.\n\n\"I'm managing, Your Majesty. Tired, yes. But it's good work. Holy work.\" He stretches his shoulders slightly, working out the stiffness. \"Hearing the confessions of sixty-two men who genuinely want to serve God - even exhausted, that feeds my soul more than rest could.\"\n\nHe nods at your second point.\n\n\"You're absolutely right, though. I have been thinking about it. I've already identified three possibilities among the Barcelona clergy - a Franciscan named Brother Tomás who has the right temperament, a young Dominican who preaches well, and a Benedictine monk who's excellent with spiritual direction.\"\n\nHe pauses, studying your face in the candlelight.\n\n\"I plan to approach them this week, see if any feel called to join the crusade as chaplains. We'll need at least five or six priests eventually, more as the army grows. Each one will need to understand your vision - the emphasis on mercy, on genuine conversion rather than forced baptism, on maintaining Christian virtue even in war.\"\n\nHe falls silent for a moment, then continues more gently:\n\n\"But Your Majesty, you didn't come here at this hour to discuss my workload or recruitment of chaplains. You said 'we need to talk' with some urgency in your voice.\"\n\nHe shifts to face you more directly, his eyes kind but penetrating.\n\n\"What's really troubling you, Juan? What brings you to the chapel tonight?\"\n\nThe candles flicker. Outside, you can hear the distant sounds of Barcelona settling into evening - voices, a dog barking, the clatter of someone closing shutters.\n\nFray Hernando waits, patient as always, ready to listen to whatever burden you've come to share.\n\nWhat do you tell him?"

          "text": "Fray Hernando has been warning Juan about certainty vs. humility, about confusing his will with God's will. This situation seems like exactly the kind of thing Hernando would be deeply troubled by. Let me think about what Hernando would say:\n\n1. He would recognize this isn't confession - Juan is telling him about a plan, not confessing sins\n2. He would be troubled by Juan's absolute certainty that this is \"God's plan\"\n3. He would question whether telling Isabel \"I love you but we can never be together\" is actually merciful or cruel\n4. He would challenge Juan's framing of this as avoiding sin/temptation\n5. He would probably be quite direct - he's never been afraid to challenge Juan\n6. He might even refuse to participate in this meeting\n\nThis feels like a moment where Hernando needs to push back hard. Juan is using religious language to justify what might actually be emotional avoidance or fear. The friar would see through this.\n\nFray Hernando sits very still as you speak. His expression doesn't change, but something in his eyes shifts - concern deepening into something more serious. When you finish, he's silent for a long moment, staring at the candles on the altar.\n\nFinally, he speaks, his voice quiet but unusually firm.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nJust that one word, flat and definitive. He turns to look at you directly.\n\n\"No, Your Majesty. I will not participate in what you're planning tomorrow.\"\n\nHe holds up a hand before you can protest.\n\n\"You came here to inform me of your decision, not to ask for guidance. You've already made up your mind with that certainty you feel so often lately. But I'm going to speak to you anyway, as your confessor and as someone who cares about your soul.\"\n\nHe stands and paces a few steps, then turns back.\n\n\"What you're planning to do tomorrow - telling that young woman that you love her but can never be with her - that's not sacrifice, Juan. That's not serving God's purpose. That's cruelty dressed up in pious language.\"\n\nHis voice is harder than you've ever heard it.\n\n\"You say you don't want to hurt her, but you're going to tell her you love her and then reject her? In front of her mother, your sister, and me? You're going to wound her deeply, publicly, and call it duty?\" He shakes his head. \"That's not mercy. That's not Christian virtue. That's you wanting to feel noble about breaking someone's heart.\"\n\nHe comes back to sit beside you, his voice dropping but losing none of its intensity.\n\n\"And this language you're using - 'God's plan,' 'my purpose,' 'must be done' - Juan, we've talked about this. How do you know this is God's will? Have you prayed about it? Have you asked God what He wants? Or have you decided what you want to do and then convinced yourself it's what God wants?\"\n\nFray Hernando leans closer.\n\n\"You say you must avoid temptations and sins. What temptations? What sins? Falling in love isn't a sin, Juan. Being attracted to a woman isn't a sin. Even desiring her isn't inherently sinful - that's how God made us. The sin comes when we use people, when we lie, when we let desire override virtue.\"\n\nHe gestures emphatically.\n\n\"You're not proposing to seduce her and abandon her. You're not planning to use her for pleasure and cast her aside. You're feeling genuine love - which you've admitted to yourself and to me. And now you're planning to reject that love because... why? Because she's converso? Because she's not politically useful? Because loving her would be complicated?\"\n\nHis voice grows softer but more penetrating.\n\n\"Those are valid concerns, Juan. The political complications are real. But don't call them 'God's purpose.' Don't pretend you're making a sacrifice for holiness when what you're really doing is avoiding something difficult and calling it duty.\"\n\nHe pauses, then continues more gently:\n\n\"Do you remember what you told me when we first spoke about discernment? You asked how to distinguish God's will from your own desires. I told you that true divine guidance leads to humility, charity, peace - even when the path is hard. It serves others' good, not just your own comfort.\"\n\nHe meets your eyes.\n\n\"So tell me - this plan of yours to tell Isabel you love her then reject her - does that lead to humility? Does it serve her good? Does it bring peace?\" He shakes his head slowly. \"Or does it let you feel noble while avoiding having to fight for something complicated? Does it protect you from risk while wounding her?\"\n\nFray Hernando stands and walks back to the altar, then turns.\n\n\"You want my participation tomorrow. You want me there as your confessor, to give this decision spiritual weight. But I won't do it, Juan. I won't stand there and watch you hurt that young woman and pretend it's God's will.\"\n\nHis voice becomes almost pleading.\n\n\"If you genuinely believe you cannot marry her - if you truly think the political complications are insurmountable - then don't tell her you love her. Don't arrange a formal meeting. Just... let it fade. Be polite but distant. Let her think it was a brief moment that passed. That would be kinder.\"\n\nHe walks back toward you.\n\n\"Or, if you must address this directly, tell her the truth: 'I'm attracted to you, I care about you, but the complications are too great and I'm not brave enough or committed enough to fight through them.' That's honest. That's real. But don't tell her you love her and frame rejecting her as holy sacrifice.\"\n\nHe sits back down beside you, his voice dropping to barely above a whisper.\n\n\"Juan, I've watched you do extraordinary things. I've seen you kneel naked before the Pope. I've seen you inspire thousands. I've watched you build something beautiful with this crusade. But this?\" He gestures helplessly. \"This looks like fear. Fear dressed up as purpose. And I won't bless it with my presence.\"\n\nHe takes your hand gently.\n\n\"You came here and said 'we need to talk.' So talk to me. Not about what you've decided, but about what you're feeling. Not about God's purpose, but about your heart. Tell me - setting aside politics and duty and crusades - what do you actually want?\"\n\nHis eyes are kind but unyielding, waiting.\n\n\"Because until you can be honest about that, you can't possibly know if you're following God's will or just running away from something that scares you.\"\n\nThe candles flicker in the silence that follows. Fray Hernando waits.\n\nWhat do you say to him?"

Offer real pastoral guidance, not just criticism\n4. Help Juan think through his options more clearly\n\nFray Hernando would be relieved that Juan is at least asking for counsel now rather than just declaring his decision.

What did you intend to accomplish when you set it up?\"\n\nHe holds up a hand.\n\n\"I'm not being rhetorical. I genuinely need to understand what you were thinking.

Were you planning to formally end something that barely began? Were you hoping for... something else?\"\n\nHis eyes are searching but not judgmental now.\n\n\"Because Juan, here's the truth: you have several options for how to proceed, and each has different consequences. But I can't advise you on which path to take until I understand what you actually want to achieve.\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"Do you want to be honest with her about your feelings?

He's imagining that he can transfer his earthly love to some kind of spiritual/heavenly realm where it can exist purely, safely, eternally. This is... complicated. It's both beautiful and potentially naive, and possibly a way to avoid dealing with the reality of his feelings.\n\nFray Hernando would recognize this as the kind of spiritual idealization that young people do - trying to make earthly desires \"holy\" by projecting them into heaven. It's not necessarily wrong, but it could be a way of avoiding the harder questions.\n\nThe confessor asked one question and Juan responded - good. Now Fray Hernando should respond to what Juan actually said, not ask more questions. He should engage with this idea of transferring earthly love to \"God's kingdom.\"\n\nFray Hernando would likely be:\n1. Moved by the sincerity and beauty of Juan's vision\n2. Concerned about the practicality and whether this is avoidance\n3. Worried about what telling Isabel this would actually do to her\n4. Wanting to help Juan think through whether this is truly kind\n\nHe shouldn't lecture, but should engage genuinely with what Juan is saying.\n\nFray Hernando is silent for a long moment, his expression shifting through several emotions - surprise, tenderness, concern, and finally something like sadness mixed with understanding.\n\n\"I apologize. You're right. I do that - ask too many questions at once.\" He takes a breath. \"Let me respond to what you've said.\"\n\nHe stands and walks a few paces, his hands clasped behind his back, thinking. When he turns back, his voice is gentle.\n\n\"What you just described - this vision of love existing purely in God's kingdom, safe and everlasting - that's beautiful, Juan. It's the kind of thing mystics write about. Saints have wrestled with similar ideas. The love that transcends earthly limitations, that becomes something spiritual and eternal.\"\n\nHe comes back to sit beside you.\n\n\"And I understand the impulse. If you can't have something in this fallen world, you imagine it perfected in the next. That's not wrong in itself.\" He pauses. \"But Juan, I need you to think about what you're planning to tell Isabel tomorrow.\"\n\nHis voice becomes more serious.\n\n\"You're imagining telling her: 'I love you, but we cannot be together in this world. Instead, I'll keep that love safe in my vision of God's kingdom, where it can be pure and eternal. I hope you can do the same.'\"\n\nHe looks at you intently.\n\n\"Do you understand what that would sound like to her? To a seventeen-year-old woman who just met you, who's feeling something she didn't expect, who's already frightened by the complications?\"\n\nHe spreads his hands.\n\n\"It would sound like you're asking her to... what? To love you spiritually but not physically? To keep her feelings for you locked away as some kind of holy offering? To live her life knowing that the King of Castile loves her in some abstract, heavenly way, but won't actually be with her?\"\n\nHis voice grows firmer.\n\n\"That's not honesty, Juan. That's not opening your heart like a good Christian. That's giving her an impossible burden. You're asking her to carry the weight of your love for her entire life, knowing it can never be real, telling her to somehow make it 'safe and pure' in some spiritual realm.\"\n\nHe leans closer.\n\n\"And more than that - it's selfish. You get to keep your feelings, nurture them in your private vision of God's kingdom, feel noble about it. But she has to live with the knowledge that you love her, that you could pursue her but won't, and that somehow she's supposed to transform that into something 'everlasting' while living a normal life. Maybe marrying someone else. Maybe never marrying because you've made her love you.\"\n\nFray Hernando's expression softens with compassion.\n\n\"I know you don't intend cruelty. I know you're trying to be honest, trying to honor what you feel. But Juan - sometimes honesty without wisdom is just selfishness. Sometimes the kind thing is not to share everything you're feeling.\"\n\nHe sits back.\n\n\"You dream of God's kingdom where your love for Isabel can exist purely. That's your spiritual journey, your inner life. But dragging her into that dream, making her complicit in it, asking her to somehow share in this abstract eternal love while you both live separate earthly lives?\"\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\"That's not fair to her. That's asking her to be part of your spiritual fantasy while denying her any real relationship. And calling it 'honesty' doesn't make it kind.\"\n\nHe looks at you with deep seriousness.\n\n\"So here's what I think you need to decide, Juan. Not five questions - just one:\n\nIs this meeting tomorrow actually for her benefit, or is it for yours?\"\n\nHe lets that sit for a moment.\n\n\"Are you doing this so she understands the situation and can move forward with her life? Or are you doing this so you can feel like you were honest, so you can have closure, so you can declare your love and feel noble about sacrificing it?\"\n\nHis voice is gentle but unyielding.\n\n\"Because if it's for you - if this is about your need to be honest, your vision of eternal love, your feelings - then you're using her. You're making her carry the weight of your emotions so you can feel better about not pursuing her.\"\n\nHe pauses.\n\n\"But if it's truly for her - if you genuinely want to spare her false hope and help her move forward - then you don't need this meeting at all. You simply... step back. Be polite but distant. Let the moment pass. Let her think it was a brief connection that didn't develop. That would be far kinder.\"\n\nFray Hernando stands.\n\n\"So which is it, Juan? What's this meeting really about?\"\n\nHe waits, watching you in the candlelight.\n\nWhat do you say?"

Give practical, kind advice\n5. Be the spiritual guide Juan needs\n\nThe question is what SHOULD Juan do? Let me think:\n- Meeting is arranged for tomorrow at 11am\n- Isabel and her mother think it's just a royal audience\n- They don't know what Juan plans to say\n- If Juan cancels it completely, it might seem strange but not catastrophic\n- If Juan goes through with it but handles it differently, that could work too\n\nFray Hernando would probably suggest:\n1. Either cancel it (simple, clean, lets things fade naturally)\n2. Or go through with it but keep it light and appropriate - just a brief audience thanking the family for their support, nothing dramatic\n\nThe key is Fray Hernando should help Juan see that he doesn't need grand gestures or dramatic declarations. Sometimes the loving thing is to just... let it be.\n\nFray Hernando's face transforms. The tension, the concern, the weariness - it all melts away, replaced by something that looks like profound relief mixed with deep affection. He sits back down beside you and places both hands on your shoulders.\n\n\"Juan.\" His voice is thick with emotion. \"Do you know how rare it is - how truly extraordinary - for someone to say 'I was wrong' about something they felt absolute certainty about just an hour ago?\"\n\nHe pulls you into a brief, tight embrace, then releases you to look at your face.\n\n\"Most people, especially kings, would rather destroy themselves and everyone around them than admit uncertainty. But you just did. You questioned your own certainty. That's not weakness, hermano. That's wisdom. That's grace.\"\n\nHe wipes his eyes quickly.\n\n\"And yes - cancel the meeting. Absolutely. Go to María tonight, tell her it's cancelled. She'll understand. She'll be relieved, honestly. She was already troubled by what you were planning.\"\n\nHe leans back, thinking through the practics.\n\n\"Tomorrow morning, María can send a message to the Ruiz family. Something simple and appropriate: 'The King sends his apologies, but urgent crusade business has arisen and he must cancel tomorrow's audience. He hopes to have the pleasure of seeing the family at future court functions.' Polite, respectful, nothing dramatic. They'll be disappointed but not suspicious.\"\n\nHe looks at you seriously.\n\n\"And then, Juan, you let it fade naturally. You don't arrange another meeting. You don't send letters. If you happen to see Isabel at some future court event - which you might, her father is a substantial merchant - you're polite, appropriate, friendly even. But distant. You let time pass. You let the intensity of these feelings settle.\"\n\nHis voice becomes gentler.\n\n\"What you're feeling right now - this overwhelming love, this sense that you can't stop thinking about her - that's real. I'm not dismissing it. But it's also partly the intensity of first attraction, of something new and exciting and forbidden. It feels all-consuming because it is, in this moment.\"\n\nHe takes your hand.\n\n\"But feelings change, Juan. They evolve. What feels unbearable today might feel manageable in a month. What seems like eternal love today might become a fond memory in a year. Or...\" He pauses. \"It might deepen into something real and lasting. But you can't know that after one meeting and one gift of poetry.\"\n\nHe squeezes your hand.\n\n\"So give yourself time. Give her time. Focus on your crusade preparation. The Royal Council in Seville is in two months. You have enormous work ahead - managing the Infantes, presenting the crusade bull, organizing your forces. You don't need this complication right now.\"\n\nHis expression becomes thoughtful.\n\n\"And Juan... maybe someday, if the feelings persist, if you keep thinking about her months from now, if you realize this isn't just infatuation - maybe then you can reassess. Maybe then you can decide if she's worth fighting for despite the complications. But that decision doesn't have to be made tonight or tomorrow. You have time.\"\n\nHe releases your hand and sits back.\n\n\"As for your vision of keeping love safe in God's kingdom - keep that for yourself, if it helps you. Pray about it, meditate on it, offer it to God. But don't share it with Isabel. That's between you and God. Let her move forward with her life without carrying the weight of your spiritual imaginings.\"\n\nFray Hernando stands and offers you his hand to help you up.\n\n\"Go to María now. Tell her the meeting is cancelled. Tell her you realized it wasn't the right approach. She'll help you compose the message to the Ruiz family.\" He smiles slightly. \"And she'll probably hug you and tell you she's proud of you for recognizing this before you did something you'd regret.\"\n\nHe walks with you toward the chapel door, then stops and turns back.\n\n\"Juan, one more thing. You said that an hour ago you had absolute certainty, and now you're unsure about many things. That uncertainty - that willingness to question yourself - that's not a weakness to overcome. That's maturity. That's the beginning of real wisdom.\"\n\nHe places a hand on your shoulder.\n\n\"The certainty you feel sometimes - about going to Rome, about the crusade, about your purpose - maybe some of that IS divine guidance. I don't know. But maybe some of it is just... youth, passion, conviction. And learning to tell the difference - learning to question even your certainties - that's how you become not just a powerful king, but a wise one.\"\n\nHe opens the chapel door.\n\n\"Now go. Talk to your sister. Get some rest. Tomorrow, focus on your crusaders, your preparations, your real work. And let this... let Isabel and her family live their lives in peace.\"\n\nHe pauses in the doorway.\n\n\"You did well tonight, Juan. Coming here, talking through this, admitting you were wrong - that took courage. Be proud of that.\"\n\nThe chapel door stands open. The palace corridors beyond are quiet. It's late evening.\n\nWhat do you do?"

He's realized that his \"absolute certainty\" about Isabel was wrong, and now he's questioning whether his other certainties - particularly sending Captain Fernán with arrest orders for the Infantes - might also be wrong.\n\nThis is a powerful character moment. He's learning humility and self-doubt, which Fray Hernando has been trying to teach him. But it's also terrifying for him because his whole approach has been based on these moments of certainty.\n\nHe's going to María now to cancel the Isabel meeting. I should:\n1. Show him rushing through the palace\n2. Have María react to his state (he's storming in, probably looking distressed)\n3. Let him tell her about canceling the meeting\n4. Have María respond - she'll be relieved but also concerned about his state\n5. Possibly address his worry about Captain Fernán\n\nLet me write this scene with appropriate emotional weight.\n\nYou barely hear Fray Hernando call after you as you stride quickly through the palace corridors. Your heart is racing, thoughts tumbling over each other. Five times. Five moments of absolute certainty. And one of them was wrong.\n\nWhat if another was wrong too?\n\nCaptain Fernán is days into his journey now. Riding hard toward Valladolid with orders to have the Infantes arrested for treason. Orders you gave with that same unshakeable certainty you just felt about Isabel.\n\nYour footsteps echo through the corridors. A servant jumps out of your way, bowing quickly. You barely notice.\n\nYou reach María's chambers and knock hard - too hard, urgent.\n\n\"Enter!\" Her voice, surprised.\n\nYou push through the door. María is at her desk, still dressed, working on correspondence by lamplight. She looks up, startled by your entrance, and immediately stands.\n\n\"Juan? What—\"\n\n\"Cancel it.\" The words tumble out. \"The meeting tomorrow. With Isabel and her mother. Cancel it. It was a mistake. I was wrong.\"\n\nMaría's expression shifts rapidly - surprise, then concern, then understanding, then relief. She comes around the desk quickly.\n\n\"Of course. Yes. I'll send word first thing in the morning.\" She reaches for your arm. \"Hermano, sit down. You look—\"\n\n\"What if I was wrong about the Infantes too?\"\n\nThe words come out raw, almost desperate. You sink onto the bench near her desk, your legs suddenly weak.\n\nMaría goes very still. \"What?\"\n\n\"I had the same certainty. The exact same feeling.\" You look up at her, and you can feel yourself trembling. \"When I ordered Fernán to ride to Álvaro with the arrest orders. I was absolutely certain it was the right thing to do. Just like I was absolutely certain an hour ago that I needed to tell Isabel I loved her and could never be with her.\"\n\nYou put your head in your hands.\n\n\"Fray Hernando talked me out of the Isabel meeting. Made me see I was being selfish, calling it duty. That I was about to wound her for no good reason.\" Your voice cracks slightly. \"But Fernán is already gone. Days into his journey. With orders that might start a civil war. Orders I gave with the same certainty I just realized was wrong.\"\n\nMaría sits down beside you slowly, processing this. Her hand finds yours.\n\n\"Juan, breathe. Just breathe for a moment.\"\n\nYou try to steady yourself, but the thoughts won't stop racing.\n\n\"What if it's all wrong, María? What if I'm just... an eighteen-year-old boy who thinks his convictions are divine guidance but really I'm just impulsive and convinced of my own rightness? What if—\"\n\n\"Stop.\" María's voice is firm but gentle. She turns your face toward her. \"Stop spiraling. Let's think through this carefully.\"\n\nShe takes both your hands in hers.\n\n\"First - you're right that you had certainty about Isabel, and you were wrong. That's important. That's a lesson. But hermano, let's look at the other certainties on your list.\"\n\nShe counts on her fingers.\n\n\"Going to Rome - that resulted in an extraordinary papal audience, a crusade bull, the True Cross itself. That worked out remarkably well. Going back for your father's sword - you discovered the Infantes' plot to make the regency permanent. Again, good outcome. Renunciating before the Pope - moved him to tears, secured his complete backing. Those certainties proved right.\"\n\nShe squeezes your hands.\n\n\"The Isabel certainty was different. It wasn't about your mission or your crusade or your political survival. It was about your personal feelings, your heart, something you desperately wanted an answer to. Maybe those kinds of certainties - the ones about your own emotions - are less reliable than the ones about your purpose.\"\n\nYou look at her, wanting to believe this distinction matters.\n\n\"But the Infantes...\" you start.\n\nMaría's expression grows more serious. \"The Infantes. Yes. Let's think about that one carefully.\" She releases one of your hands to pour wine for both of you. \"You ordered their arrest based on reports that they rebelled, seized fortresses, tried to rally nobles against you during your absence. Is that correct?\"\n\nYou nod.\n\n\"And those reports - they came from Álvaro, yes? From your intelligence network? From reliable sources?\"\n\n\"Yes. You confirmed them yourself. You told me what happened.\"\n\nShe nods slowly. \"I did. Because it's true, Juan. They did rebel. They did try to build a coalition against you. They failed, but they attempted it. Those are facts, not feelings.\"\n\nShe hands you the wine.\n\n\"So the question isn't whether your certainty about their guilt was wrong. The question is whether arresting them - that specific action, in that specific way - was the right response.\"\n\nShe sips her wine thoughtfully.\n\n\"And honestly, hermano? I don't know. I thought it was risky when you ordered it. I still think it's risky. It might trigger exactly the civil war you're trying to prevent.\" She meets your eyes. \"But it's also possible it was necessary. That showing strength, holding traitors accountable, was the only way to establish your authority. Sometimes kings have to make dangerous moves.\"\n\nShe sets down her cup.\n\n\"The difference between the Isabel decision and the Infantes decision is this: With Isabel, Fray Hernando could show you that you were being selfish, that you were about to cause unnecessary pain for your own emotional closure. The action served no good purpose.\"\n\nShe leans forward.\n\n\"But with the Infantes - even if it's risky, even if it might go wrong - there's a real argument that traitors must face consequences. That a king who doesn't hold rebels accountable looks weak. That might be wrong, but it's not obviously selfish or cruel like the Isabel meeting would have been.\"\n\nYou feel slightly less panicked but still uncertain.\n\n\"So what do I do? Fernán is already days gone. I can't call him back.\"\n\nMaría thinks for a long moment.\n\n\"You could send another rider. Fast horses, riding even harder than Fernán. With new orders - to modify the original command. Perhaps to arrest only if certain conditions are met. Or to coordinate with Álvaro first before taking action. Or...\" She pauses. \"Or to give the Infantes a chance to surrender voluntarily before formal arrest.\"\n\nShe watches your face carefully.\n\n\"But Juan, you need to be clear about why you'd do that. Is it because you genuinely think the original order was wrong? Or is it because you're panicking after realizing you were wrong about Isabel?\"\n\nShe touches your face gently.\n\n\"There's a difference between wise reconsideration and just second-guessing yourself into paralysis. You can't function as a king if every decision you make, you immediately doubt because one decision proved wrong.\"\n\nShe sits back.\n\n\"So tell me - setting aside your panic about Isabel - do you actually think arresting the Infantes was wrong? Or do you think it was risky but potentially necessary?\"\n\nWhat do you say to your sister?"

Within a quarter hour, they arrive: Sir Thomas still in his traveling clothes, Fray Hernando looking weary but alert, and Rodrigo in his captain's sword belt, adjusting to his new authority.\n\nThey settle around the table in your chamber. A servant brings wine, then withdraws.\n\nSir Thomas speaks first, his practical English mind assessing the situation:\n\n\"Your Majesty, Barcelona has been remarkably successful. Sixty-two crusaders recruited - about half are decent fighters, the rest need more training but they're willing. Eighty thousand florins is substantial. The Archbishop's backing gives you legitimacy in Aragon.\"\n\nHe pauses, considering.\n\n\"But we're also stretched thin. Seven experienced fighters counting you, plus sixty-two recruits who aren't battle-ready yet. If we face serious trouble on the road, we're vulnerable. And every day we stay, we risk complications - political attention, the Infantes' agents watching, more time for Granada to prepare.\"\n\nRodrigo adds his perspective, speaking carefully in his new role:\n\n\"Training is going well, Your Majesty. García, Marco, Sir Thomas and I have them drilling daily. In another two weeks, maybe three, the better ones will be competent enough for real service. But right now...\" He shrugs. \"They can march, they can guard a camp, but in a real fight, they'd need heavy support.\"\n\nHe glances at a document on the table.\n\n\"Also, equipment is still being procured. We've armed about half properly. The rest have basic gear but nothing standardized. That takes time and money, even with what we have.\"\n\nFray Hernando offers the spiritual perspective:\n\n\"The men's faith is genuine, Your Majesty. I've been working with them daily - confession, instruction, building that culture you wanted. But they're still learning what it means to be crusaders rather than just soldiers. That spiritual formation takes time.\"\n\nHe leans forward.\n\n\"And there's opportunity here still. Brother Tomás, the Franciscan I mentioned - he's agreed to join us as a chaplain. I'm meeting tomorrow with the Dominican and the Benedictine. If we stay another week, I could likely recruit two or three more priests. That gives us the spiritual infrastructure we need.\"\n\nSir Thomas nods at this, then continues:\n\n\"The question of route remains, Your Majesty. Sea or land to Seville. We still don't have good intelligence about Granada's naval activity. Your sister might be able to help with that - her contacts in the Consell would know about Mediterranean shipping.\"\n\nRodrigo adds: \"And if we go by sea, hiring three ships as you suggested would take time to arrange properly. Finding captains who work together, negotiating terms, loading supplies and horses - that's at least a week of preparation.\"\n\nFray Hernando interjects: \"The Royal Council is November 8th. Today is August 28th. That's ten weeks. If we leave Barcelona in early September, we'd have six or seven weeks in Seville before the council. That's adequate time to prepare, coordinate with Don Álvaro, plan your presentation.\"\n\nSir Thomas drums his fingers on the table: \"But if we stay here three more weeks - recruiting more chaplains, training the men better, procuring all equipment properly - we'd arrive in Seville mid-to-late September with only five weeks before the council. Tighter timeline.\"\n\nThe three men look at you, waiting.\n\nWhat questions do you have for them? What's your assessment?"

The men would be competent - not veterans, but solid enough to be useful in a fight. And having everyone properly equipped means they look like an army, not a mob. That matters for morale and intimidation.\"\n\nSir Thomas nods thoughtfully: \"Three ships also means we can distribute the force - perhaps twenty men per ship plus crew. If one ship has trouble, the others can assist or at least preserve most of our strength. It's sound military thinking.\"\n\nHe pauses, considering: \"My concern is the timeline. Arriving in Seville with only five weeks before the Royal Council is tight. You'll need time to coordinate with Don Álvaro, understand the political situation there, plan your presentation of the crusade bull, potentially negotiate with nobles...\"\n\nFray Hernando interjects: \"But arriving with seventy trained crusaders, multiple chaplains, and visible strength - that makes a statement. It shows the crusade is real, organized, disciplined. That could be more valuable than extra weeks of political maneuvering.\"\n\nRodrigo adds: \"And Your Majesty, if we're traveling by sea with three ships, the journey is only about a week, maybe eight days. Much faster than overland. So the tight timeline isn't as dangerous as it might seem.\"\n\nSir Thomas strokes his beard: \"There's also the question of intelligence about Granada's fleet. Three weeks gives us time to gather better information. If we learn the sea route is genuinely dangerous, we could shift to the overland plan. Flexibility is valuable.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly: \"So yes, Your Majesty. I think this is a sound plan. Three more weeks in Barcelona for training and preparation, then three ships to Seville. The risks are manageable, and the benefits are substantial.\"\n\nRodrigo nods agreement. \"I support this plan.\"\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"As do I.

I should keep it fairly concise and give the user opportunities to weigh in.\n\nSir Thomas leans forward with interest: \"Uniform equipment is excellent thinking, Your Majesty. Distinguishes your crusaders from common soldiers, builds unit cohesion, creates visual impact.\"\n\nHe considers: \"For color - white is yours alone, as you say. Red is often used for crusaders, but that's common. What about white and red together? White tabards with red crosses? It echoes your personal garb while being distinct.\"\n\nRodrigo adds: \"Tabards are practical - worn over armor, easy to put on and remove, clearly visible. A gambeson works as light armor but it's bulkier, harder to standardize sizing, more expensive.\"\n\nFray Hernando speaks up: \"White and red also has spiritual symbolism. White for purity of purpose, red for Christ's blood and willingness to shed blood for the faith. It's appropriate for crusaders.\"\n\nSir Thomas nods: \"Barcelona has excellent textile workers. Three weeks should be enough to commission sixty-two tabards - probably 4-5 florins each, so around 300 florins total. Simple design: white cloth, red cross on chest and back. Durable but not elaborate.\"\n\nHe pauses: \"As for the clasps - that's more complex. How many do you envision needing eventually? Just the current sixty-two, or hundreds more as you recruit in Castile?\"\n\nRodrigo adds: \"And should all crusaders get the same clasp, or different designs for different ranks? Officers versus common soldiers?\"\n\nFray Hernando offers: \"The clasp could have religious significance. Perhaps a cross design, or Santiago's scallop shell, or the keys of Saint Peter since this crusade has papal authority.\"\n\nSir Thomas continues: \"If you want hundreds ready by November, we should send orders to Seville smiths or jewelers now. But the design needs to be decided, and someone trustworthy needs to oversee production there. Perhaps Diego could carry the specifications when he goes ahead to coordinate your arrival?\"\n\nAll three look at you.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the tabard design?

The Knights Hospitaller (Order of St. John) use black mantles with white crosses. The Order of Santiago uses a red cross in the shape of a sword. So a white tabard with red cross shouldn't directly conflict, though it might evoke Templar imagery.\n\nThe war cry \"Non nobis domine\" is from Psalm 115, famously associated with the Templars. This could be problematic or could be seen as reclaiming that heritage.\n\nThe clasp design - depicting the mosque of Granada is interesting but potentially problematic. It's depicting an Islamic holy site, which might be seen as strange for Christian crusaders. The advisors should discuss this.\n\nLet me have them respond thoughtfully to each point.\n\nSir Thomas's eyebrows rise slightly: \"White tabards with red crosses... Your Majesty, that's very close to the Knights Templar's design. They wore white mantles with red crosses.\"\n\nHe pauses, seeing your expression: \"But the Templars were dissolved over a century ago. Their symbolism isn't claimed by anyone now. It might actually work in your favor - people remember the Templars as elite crusaders. Evoking that legacy could be powerful.\"\n\nFray Hernando looks thoughtful: \"And 'Non Nobis Domine' - that's from Psalm 115. 'Not unto us, O Lord, but unto Your name give glory.' It was the Templars' motto as well. You're essentially reclaiming Templar imagery for a new crusade.\"\n\nHe considers: \"That's either brilliant or dangerous. Some will see it as honoring a noble tradition. Others might worry you're trying to resurrect a dissolved order. But given your papal backing...\" He nods slowly. \"It could work. The Pope blessed you. If anyone questions it, you have that authority.\"\n\nRodrigo adds practically: \"Shields are easy. White background, red cross. Clear, visible in battle, recognizable from distance. Barcelona shield-makers can produce those. Maybe 15-20 florins per shield, so another 900-1,200 florins.\"\n\nSir Thomas returns to the clasp design: \"Iron is good - affordable, can be made in quantity. But Your Majesty...\" He hesitates. \"An image of Granada's mosque on a Christian crusader's clasp? That's... unusual. You're depicting an Islamic holy site as your symbol?\"\n\nFray Hernando frowns slightly: \"It might be seen as venerating the enemy's sacred place. Or worse, as displaying a trophy before you've earned it - counting your victories before they happen.\"\n\nRodrigo ventures: \"What about instead - an image of a Christian church, representing what the mosque will become? Or Santiago on horseback? Or the True Cross itself, since you carry it?\"\n\nSir Thomas adds: \"Or keep it simpler - just a cross with 'Granada' inscribed beneath. Clear goal, Christian symbol, nothing that could be misinterpreted.\"\n\nAll three look uncertain about the mosque image specifically, though they're clearly trying to be respectful of your vision.\n\nWhat do you think? Modify the clasp design, or explain your reasoning for the mosque?"

For sixty-two now, plus extras for future recruits... order perhaps 150 to start?

You're making us independent voices for conscience and virtue.\"\n\nSir Thomas nods approvingly: \"Smart politically too, Your Majesty. It shows the Pope and Church hierarchy that you're serious about spiritual oversight. That you're not just using the crusade bull as military authorization, but actually honoring its intent.\"\n\nRodrigo looks thoughtful: \"So chaplains can enter any part of the camp, speak to any soldier, report directly to Father Hernando or even to Rome if needed. No commander can stop them.\" He nods slowly. \"That will keep officers honest. Harder to hide abuses if chaplains can go anywhere.\"\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"And the book symbol makes clear we serve different authority. We're not part of the military chain of command. We serve God's law and Church teaching first.\" He looks at you with deep respect. \"You're building something unusual here, Juan.

More valuable than common iron, shows their importance, but different from the commanders' bronze/silver crosses with aureoles.\"\n\nRodrigo adds: \"And how many?

He's proven himself exceptional as a training sergeant. The men respect him, he knows his business, and he's completely committed. García says he's the best soldier in the company after Sir Thomas.\n\nAlonso Fernández - recruited on day three, age twenty-six. Former man-at-arms for a Catalan noble who died last year. Professional soldier, knows formation fighting, calm under pressure. Could be an officer with some seasoning.\n\nPedro Álvarez - day five recruit, age thirty-two. Veteran of border skirmishes with Aragon. Rough around the edges but experienced. Good with pike and crossbow. Men listen to him.\"\n\nHe pauses, then continues: \"And surprisingly, Andrea - your farm boy from the first four. He's raw, but he learns fast, never complains, works harder than anyone. The other men like him. He won't be a brilliant fighter, but he could be a solid sergeant someday if he survives long enough.\"\n\nFray Hernando takes his turn:\n\n\"From a spiritual perspective, I'd highlight different men:\n\nBrother Guillem - day seven recruit. He's actually a Benedictine monk, age twenty-eight, who felt called to leave his monastery for the crusade. Educated, devout, handles weapons surprisingly well for a monk. The other men go to him for counsel even though I'm the official confessor.\n\nGiovanni - your blacksmith from the first four. Simple faith, but profound. He prays more than anyone except me. When he talks about serving Christ, men believe him. He's becoming a spiritual anchor for the company.\n\nTomás Garcia - day four recruit, age twenty-three. Son of a converso family like Isabel's, but he converted more deeply than his parents. Passionate about proving his faith through service. Asks theological questions, reads Scripture daily. Could perhaps assist with chaplain duties.\"\n\nFray Hernando adds: \"And I should mention Pietro from your first four. He started as an enthusiastic boy, but he's grown. He takes confession seriously, he's studying the crusading vows, he talks to the other young recruits about what it means to be a soldier of Christ. His faith is maturing.\"\n\nSir Thomas interjects: \"If I may add one more, Your Majesty - Miguel Cardona, recruited day nine. He's Pere de Cardona's nephew - minor nobility, age twenty-four. Well-trained, wealthy family. He didn't have to join, but he did anyway. That carries weight with the other noble-born recruits. And having a Cardona in the ranks strengthens your ties to that family.\"\n\nRodrigo nods: \"Those eight represent the cream of what we've recruited.

A man might want to write a letter home - he needs coin for a scribe. His boots wear out beyond repair - he needs new ones. He wants to buy a charm for his wife, or medicine for a sick child. Small things, but they matter.\"\n\nAlonso Fernández adds: \"Also, Your Majesty, in most armies, soldiers expect regular pay even when fed and housed. It's tradition, it's how they measure their worth. A man who serves for nothing but eventual reward feels like... a servant, not a soldier. Pay gives dignity.\"\n\nMiguel Cardona offers the noble perspective: \"The promise of Granada's lands is valuable, Your Majesty. But it's also uncertain - men don't know what they'll receive, or when. A monthly wage, even small, gives them something concrete. Something they can count on while they wait for the larger reward.\"\n\nBrother Guillem speaks thoughtfully: \"Your Majesty, I took vows of poverty. I need no coin. But these men didn't take such vows. They have worldly responsibilities that are not sinful - caring for family is Christian duty. Perhaps a small stipend? Enough to send home monthly, to keep families from destitution?\"\n\nAndrea adds nervously: \"My mother remarried, Your Majesty, so I don't have family to support. But some men here, they worry. They want to serve you, but they also don't want their children hungry.\"\n\nThe men wait for your response to this practical concern.\n\nWhat do you say?"

But that's when they must provide their own food and lodging.\"\n\nMarco nods: \"As a mercenary, I've been paid anywhere from 3 to 8 maravedís daily, depending on the campaign and who's hiring.

That's 60 maravedís monthly - enough to send home to keep a family fed, but not lavish.\"\n\nRodrigo calculates quickly: \"With sixty-two crusaders now, that's 124 maravedís daily, about 3,720 per month.

A sergeant perhaps 4 maravedís daily, a captain 8-10. Skilled men like smiths or engineers even more.\"\n\nPedro Álvarez speaks practically: \"Your Majesty, soldiers also expect a bonus for victories. When we take a city, there's usually plunder rights or a one-time payment. That's separate from regular wages but important for morale.\"\n\nFray Hernando adds quietly: \"The Church often provides indulgences as spiritual payment for crusaders. The temporal wage supplements the eternal reward. Both matter to men with families and souls to save.\"\n\nThe men wait to hear your decision on wages.\n\nWhat do you decide?"

The florin was a gold coin, while the maravedí was a unit of account (often silver-based).\n\nLet me provide this information clearly and help Juan understand the implications for his treasury.\n\nDiego, your secretary, speaks up from where he's been taking notes: \"Your Majesty, the exchange rate fluctuates, but currently in Barcelona a Florentine florin is worth approximately 265 to 270 maravedís. Let's say 265 for simplicity.\"\n\nHe does quick calculations on his parchment: \"So your current treasury:\n\n82,000 florins from Barcelona = approximately 21,730,000 maravedís\n\n20,000 florins from the Pope = approximately 5,300,000 maravedís\n\nPlus approximately 60,000 florins from Florence = approximately 15,900,000 maravedís\n\nTotal: roughly 162,000 florins, or about 42,930,000 maravedís\"\n\nRodrigo calculates the payroll implications: \"At 60 maravedís per month per crusader:\n\nCurrent 62 crusaders = 3,720 maravedís monthly\n\nIf we recruit 500 crusaders = 30,000 maravedís monthly\n\nIf we reach 2,000 crusaders = 120,000 maravedís monthly\n\nFor 5,000 crusaders = 300,000 maravedís monthly\"\n\nSir Thomas adds context: \"Your Majesty, you mentioned annual Castilian royal revenue is about 30 million maravedís. So 5,000 crusaders at this wage would cost 3.6 million annually - about 12% of royal revenue. Sustainable if the crusade taxes work as planned.\"\n\nMarco notes: \"And that's before equipment, supplies, siege engines, fortifications, horses... The wage is actually one of the smaller costs in a major campaign.\"\n\nDiego continues: \"Your current treasury of 43 million maravedís could pay 5,000 crusaders for almost a year before running out.

          "text": "The mission is straightforward: three experienced men (Captain Fernán has been with Juan throughout, proven loyal and capable) riding fast to deliver a message to Álvaro de Luna in Valladolid.\n\nFactors in favor of success:\n1. Captain Fernán is experienced, loyal, and has been Juan's military commander\n2. Three riders traveling light and fast - harder to intercept\n3. Direct route from Barcelona to Valladolid is well-established\n4. They have royal authority if challenged\n5. Álvaro de Luna controls Valladolid and the royal administration\n6. The mission is simple message delivery, not complex political maneuvering\n7. Two weeks is reasonable time for the journey\n\nPotential obstacles:\n1. The Infantes have been intercepting correspondence (though Juan doesn't know this yet)\n2. Road hazards - bandits, accidents, weather\n3. The Infantes have some support in northern Castile\n4. Horses could go lame or riders could fall ill\n5. The Captain could be recognized and detained\n\nHowever, the interception network seems to be focused on written correspondence through normal channels, not fast riders on direct royal business. Captain Fernán is competent and traveling with two guards. The route from Barcelona to Valladolid, while long, passes through mostly controlled territory.\n \nI assess the mission's probability as moderately high - strong advantages counterbalance potential risks. The strategic advantages outweigh the potential obstacles, making success more probable than failure. While challenges exist, the mission's core elements - speed, royal authority, and competent leadership - provide a solid foundation for accomplishing the objective.\n\nLooking at Captain Fernán's mission to deliver the arrest warrant to Álvaro de Luna, let me assess the probability of success.\n\nProbability Assessment: Likely to succeed\n\nFactors in Your Favor:\n\nCaptain Fernán's proven competence: He's been your loyal commander throughout the journey, knows how to handle himself\n\nThree-rider configuration: Harder to stop than a lone messenger, can help each other if problems arise\n\nSpeed and light travel: Riding hard with minimal baggage makes them difficult to intercept\n\nÁlvaro's control of Valladolid: Your destination is firmly in friendly hands with your Constable in charge\n\nClear, direct route: Barcelona to Valladolid is a well-traveled road through mostly stable territory\n\nRoyal seal and authority: The letter bears your official seal - anyone who interferes commits treason\n\nPotential Obstacles:\n\nTwo-week journey: Long distance means more opportunities for mishap - thrown shoes, lame horses, illness\n\nThe Infantes' northern influence: Parts of the route pass near territories where the Infantes have supporters\n\nStandard road dangers: Bandits, bad weather, accidents are always possible\n\nPolitical tensions: News travels - the Infantes may have watchers on major roads looking for royal messengers\n\nUnknown interception network: (Though you're unaware, the Infantes have been reading your correspondence)\n\nAssessment:\n\nThis is a straightforward military courier mission - the type Captain Fernán has likely undertaken before. He's traveling with support, on fast horses, with clear orders and destination. While the journey is long and some risk exists, barring bad luck or unexpected Infante interference, he should reach Álvaro successfully.\n\nThe real question isn't whether the message reaches Álvaro, but what happens after - though that's beyond this action's scope.\n\nPlease roll your dice to determine the outcome of Captain Fernán's mission."

The Infantes aren't just nobles - they're princes of Aragon, one is King of Navarre. Arresting them is essentially declaring war on the Aragonese royal family.\n\nLooking at Álvaro de Luna's attempt to arrest the Infantes de Aragón on charges of rebellion, let me assess the probability of success.\n\nProbability Assessment: Likely to fail\n\nMajor Obstacles:\n\nThe Infantes are forewarned: Their spy network has been intercepting your correspondence (though you don't know this). They likely know arrest orders are coming\n\nThey're Aragonese royalty: Not just Castilian nobles but foreign princes - Infante Juan is King of Navarre, both are brothers to Alfonso V of Aragon\n\nThey still have military force: ~5,000 troops between their households and allied nobles - enough to resist arrest\n\nTheir strategic positions: They control Arévalo fortress and have retreated to fortified estates, not caught in the open\n\nInternational implications: Arresting them risks war with Aragon and Navarre\n\nNoble uncertainty: While 60% of nobles stayed neutral, forcibly arresting princes might push them to pick sides\n\nPhysical difficulty: The Infantes aren't at court where they could be easily seized - they're on their estates with armed retainers\n\nFactors in Álvaro's Favor:\n\nRoyal authority: He has legitimate arrest warrant from the king for proven rebellion\n\nControl of administration: Commands royal forces and major cities\n\nThe Infantes' weakened position: Their revolt failed, they're politically isolated\n\nÁlvaro's competence: He successfully defended the realm, he's politically skilled\n\nDiscretionary orders: You wisely gave him flexibility (\"proceed only if grounds for trial\")\n\nSome noble support: 30-35% actively support the crown\n\nAssessment:\n\nWhile Álvaro has legal authority and the Infantes are weakened, actually arresting royal princes with military forces on fortified estates is extremely difficult. They're not courtiers who can be seized at dinner - they're armed princes who likely know you're coming. Álvaro might successfully demand their surrender, but physically arresting them seems unlikely without triggering open warfare.\n\nThe most probable outcome is a tense standoff rather than successful arrests.\n\nPlease roll your dice to determine what happens when Álvaro attempts to execute the arrest warrant."

They rode like men pursued by demons, changing horses at way stations, sleeping only when absolutely necessary.\n\nDay 4 (August 22): Crossed into Aragonese territory near Lérida. Local garrison noted their passage but didn't interfere - the Consell Reial's safe passage held.\n\nDay 7 (August 25): Entered Castilian territory near Soria. Fernán relaxed slightly - home soil at last. They pressed harder, knowing they were close.\n\nDay 10 (August 28): Felipe's horse threw a shoe badly. They lost six hours finding a farrier in a small village. Fernán paced like a caged wolf.\n\nDay 14 (September 2): Exhausted, saddle-sore, but intact, the three riders clattered into Valladolid's main gate. Guards recognized the Captain immediately.\n\n\"Christ's blood, Fernán! We thought you were with the King!\"\n\n\"I am. Where's Don Álvaro?\"\n\n\"The palace. He'll want to see you immediately.\"\n\nDelivering the Orders\n\nÁlvaro de Luna received Fernán in his private study within the hour. The Constable looked older, worn from months of holding the kingdom together.\n\n\"Captain. I assume this isn't a social visit.\"\n\nFernán handed over the sealed letter. Álvaro read it twice, his expression darkening.\n\n\"Arrest the Infantes. On charges of rebellion.\" He set the letter down carefully. \"His Majesty understands what this means?\"\n\n\"He was very clear, my lord. They rebelled while he was on pilgrimage. They must face consequences. Though he also writes you should proceed only if there are grounds for trial.\"\n\nÁlvaro stood and walked to the window overlooking the city. \"Oh, there are grounds. They seized royal fortresses. They attempted to rally the nobility against the crown. They portrayed His Majesty as unstable.\" He turned back. \"The question isn't whether they're guilty. It's whether arresting them is possible without starting a civil war.\"\n\n\"What are your orders for me, Lord Constable?\"\n\n\"Rest. Eat. Sleep in a real bed. I need to think about how to execute this. And Captain... well done. Fourteen days from Barcelona is exceptional time.\"\n\nÁlvaro's Attempt (September 3-10)\n\nThe War Council (September 3)\n\nÁlvaro assembled his most trusted advisors:\n\nDiego López de Stúñiga, commander of royal forces\n\nJuan de Daza, treasury official and intelligence gatherer\n\nCount Diego Gómez de Sandoval, monitoring noble factions\n\nBishop Juan de Cerezuela, Álvaro's ally in the Church\n\n\"The King has ordered the arrest of the Infantes de Aragón for rebellion,\" Álvaro announced.\n\nSilence. Then Diego López spoke: \"They're at their estates with at least 2,000 household troops. We'd need to assault fortified positions.\"\n\n\"Or we could summon them to appear,\" suggested the Bishop. \"Publicly demand they present themselves for trial.\"\n\nJuan de Daza shook his head. \"My sources say they've been expecting something. They've been strengthening their positions, calling in debts, securing supplies. They won't come willingly.\"\n\nCount Sandoval added grimly: \"Several neutral nobles have received letters from Infante Juan. He's claiming the King has been 'bewitched' in Rome, that Álvaro is using forged orders to eliminate rivals. Some are listening.\"\n\nThe Public Summons (September 5)\n\nÁlvaro chose the middle path. In Valladolid's main square, heralds proclaimed:\n\n\"By order of His Majesty Juan II, King of Castile and León: The Infantes Don Juan and Don Enrique de Aragón are hereby summoned to present themselves to royal justice to answer charges of rebellion, seizure of royal property, and conspiracy against the crown. They have ten days to surrender themselves peacefully. Failure to appear will be considered admission of guilt and act of continued rebellion.\"\n\nThe proclamation was copied and sent to every major city in Castile.\n\nThe Infantes' Response (September 7)\n\nA herald arrived under flag of truce from Arévalo fortress with the Infantes' reply:\n\n\"We, Juan and Enrique, Infantes of Aragón, deny all charges of rebellion. We acted to preserve the stability of Castile during our cousin's extended absence, when he abandoned his realm for foreign adventures. We question the legitimacy of orders issued in the King's absence and demand to see His Majesty personally before submitting to any proceedings. We will not surrender ourselves to Don Álvaro de Luna, whom we consider party to this conflict rather than neutral arbiter of justice.\"\n\nThey also sent copies of their response to every major noble house, the Archbishop of Toledo, and King Alfonso V in Naples.\n\nThe Failed Arrest Attempt (September 10)\n\nÁlvaro had to act. He assembled 1,500 royal troops and marched toward Arévalo, the nearest Infante stronghold. But when they arrived, they found:\n\nThe fortress fully garrisoned with 800 men\n\nThe Infantes' allied nobles had sent reinforcements\n\nThe surrounding countryside had been stripped of supplies\n\nMost critically: The Infantes themselves weren't there\n\nThey had withdrawn to separate locations - Infante Juan to his wife's estates near the Navarrese border, Infante Enrique to fortified positions in the north. They'd divided their forces, making simultaneous arrest impossible.\n\nWhen Álvaro demanded entry to Arévalo, the garrison commander (loyal to the Infantes) responded: \"This fortress is held in the name of stability and proper governance. We await the King's personal command, not the orders of his over-mighty subject.\"\n\nThe Standoff\n\nÁlvaro faced an impossible choice:\n\nAssault Arévalo: Would succeed but with heavy casualties, and the Infantes weren't even there\n\nPursue the Infantes separately: Would divide his forces dangerously\n\nMaintain siege: Would tie down troops needed elsewhere\n\nWithdraw: Would look weak but preserve forces\n\nAfter three days of tense standoff, Álvaro withdrew to Valladolid. He'd successfully avoided bloodshed but failed to arrest the Infantes.\n\nSeptember Developments in Castile\n\nThe Noble Response (September 11-20)\n\nThe failed arrest attempt had immediate consequences:\n\nThose Supporting the Crown (30-35%) rallied more firmly to Álvaro:\n\n\"The Infantes are proven traitors refusing royal justice\"\n\nSeveral offered troops if needed\n\nCities like Burgos and Toledo explicitly banned the Infantes from entering\n\nThe Neutral Majority (50-55%) grew more nervous:\n\nMany withdrew to their estates to wait\n\nSome began fortifying their own positions\n\nLetters flew between noble houses discussing contingencies\n\nCommon question: \"Is the King truly in command, or has Álvaro seized power?\"\n\nThe Infantes' Supporters (15-20%) grew bolder:\n\nClaimed this proved Álvaro was tyrant using king's name\n\nSome began mustering their own forces\n\nMaster of Santiago (Luis de Guzmán) publicly questioned the arrest order's legitimacy\n\nLetters from Aragon (September 15)\n\nKing Alfonso V, from Naples, sent formal protest:\n\n\"To our beloved cousin Juan of Castile (when this reaches him) and to Don Álvaro de Luna who currently governs: We are gravely concerned by reports of attempts to arrest our brothers without proper trial or evidence. Such actions against princes of Aragon constitute hostile acts. We trust cooler heads will prevail and this matter will be resolved when Our cousin returns to exercise personal judgment.\"\n\nThe threat was clear: arrest the Infantes and risk war with Aragon.\n\nThe Church's Position (September 18)\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo, technically part of the regency council, issued a carefully worded statement:\n\n\"The Church counsels patience and reconciliation. These matters should await His Majesty's return. We pray all parties will refrain from actions that might spill Christian blood.\"\n\nTranslation: The Church wouldn't support civil war over this.\n\nIntelligence Reports (September 20-25)\n\nJuan de Daza and Diego Gómez de Sandoval gathered disturbing intelligence:\n\nThe Infantes' Network:\n\nThey'd known the arrest order was coming (source unknown)\n\nThey'd prepared safe houses and escape routes\n\nThey were actively recruiting more nobles with promises of positions once \"proper governance\" was restored\n\nThey'd sent agents to Granada suggesting Castile was too divided to launch any crusade\n\nEconomic Impact:\n\nTrade disrupted by uncertainty\n\nSome merchants withdrawing funds from royal banks\n\nTax collection down 15% as collectors feared entering disputed areas\n\nMilitary expenses mounting with troops on alert\n\nPopular Sentiment:\n\nCommon people confused and frightened\n\nRumors wild: \"The King is dead,\" \"The King has become a monk,\" \"Álvaro has imprisoned the King\"\n\nSome villages preparing for war\n\nOthers just want to harvest crops in peace\n\nÁlvaro's Holding Action (September 25-28)\n\nBy late September, Álvaro had achieved a tense stability:\n\nWhat He Managed:\n\nPrevented open civil war\n\nKept major cities loyal\n\nMaintained government functions\n\nProtected royal revenues (mostly)\n\nAvoided giving Infantes martyrdom through bloodshed\n\nWhat He Failed to Do:\n\nArrest the Infantes as ordered\n\nPrevent them from strengthening position\n\nStop erosion of royal authority\n\nQuiet growing doubts about the King's status\n\nHis Message to Juan (sent September 26, will reach Seville soon after Juan):\n\n\"Your Majesty,\n\nYour orders regarding the Infantes have been received and acted upon. They refused summons to trial and have withdrawn to fortified positions. Attempted arrest would require military campaign resulting in significant bloodshed.\n\nThe realm holds, but tensions mount daily. Your personal presence is urgently needed. Some question whether you truly issued these orders or whether I act independently. Others spread rumors you've died or abdicated.\n\nI've preserved your authority and prevented open warfare, but cannot maintain this balance indefinitely. The Infantes grow bolder, neutrals grow fearful, and even loyalists grow doubtful.\n\nCome swiftly. Show yourself to your people. Whatever you achieved in Rome, we need you here now.\n\nYour servant,\nÁlvaro de Luna\"\n\nThe Situation Awaiting Juan (Late September 1430)\n\nWhen Juan arrives in Seville (which you haven't reached yet), he will find:\n\nThe Good News:\n\nNo civil war has erupted\n\nMajor cities remain loyal\n\nGovernment still functions\n\nHis core supporters held firm\n\nThe Infantes exposed as refusing royal justice\n\nThe Bad News:\n\nThe Infantes remain free and defiant\n\nThey've strengthened their position\n\nNoble neutrality hardening into fear\n\nRoyal authority questioned\n\nAragon threatening intervention\n\nRumors about the King running wild\n\nEconomic disruption beginning\n\nGranada watching Castilian weakness\n\nThe Immediate Challenges:\n\nMust show himself publicly to dispel rumors\n\nMust decide whether to pursue arrests or seek reconciliation\n\nMust convince nobles the crusade is still viable\n\nMust respond to Alfonso V's threat\n\nMust restore confidence in royal authority\n\nMust prevent Infantes from sabotaging November 8 council\n\nThe Hidden Danger (unknown to Juan):\nThe Infantes knew the arrest was coming because they've been reading his letters. They're prepared for his every move. This intelligence advantage remains their secret weapon.\n\nCaptain Fernán awaits in Valladolid, ready to ride south when summoned. Álvaro holds the center but watches the edges crumble. The Infantes plot their next move from their fortresses.\n\nThe kingdom holds its breath, waiting for its young king to return from his holy journey and face the crisis his absence—and his orders—have created."

          "text": "Juan II of Castile in 1430 (we've aged him down to 18 for the game):\n- Historically, Juan II was born in 1405 and died in 1454\n- His father was Henry III of Castile (died 1406)\n- His mother was Catherine of Lancaster\n\nJuan II's siblings:\n- María of Castile (his sister, married to Alfonso V of Aragon) - in our game she's in Barcelona\n- Catherine of Castile (another sister, married to Infante Henry, Duke of Villena)\n\nSo if Juan II died without children, and his siblings died without children, who would inherit?\n\nWe need to go back up the family tree to Henry III's siblings or further back to John I of Castile (Juan II's grandfather).\n\nHenry III's siblings:\n- Ferdinand I of Aragon (born 1380, died 1416) - He was actually Henry III's brother! He became King of Aragon through the Compromise of Caspe in 1412.\n\nWait, this is important - Ferdinand I of Aragon was actually a Castilian prince (Infante) before becoming King of Aragon. He was the younger brother of Henry III of Castile.\n\nSo the Infantes de Aragón (Juan and Enrique) who are causing problems in our story are actually Juan II's first cousins - they're the sons of Ferdinand I of Aragon, who was Henry III's brother.\n\nSo the line of succession if Juan II and his sisters died without heirs would actually potentially go to... the Infantes de Aragón themselves, as they're the male-line descendants of the Trastámara dynasty through Ferdinand I.\n\nBut let me think more carefully:\n\nThe Trastámara line:\n- Henry II of Castile (first Trastámara king)\n\n- John I of Castile (his son)\n- Henry III of Castile (John I's son)\n- Juan II of Castile (Henry III's son)\n\nI see the family's complex succession involves multiple branches. John I had two key sons: Henry III (Juan II's direct line) and Ferdinand \"of Antequera\" (who became the Aragonese royal line). If Juan II's direct descendants perished, the crown would likely pass to Ferdinand's descendants - the Aragonese royal family. However, potential alternative claimants might exist through female lineages or other familial branches.\n\nPotential succession paths reveal intricate political dynamics. Female-line connections through Portuguese royal marriages could introduce additional claims. The hierarchy of succession appears nuanced: first Juan II's potential children, then his sisters' potential offspring, followed by the Aragonese line and possibly Portuguese royalty through female descent. These complex inheritance possibilities represent politically sensitive information that could dramatically impact royal power struggles.\n\nLooking at the question of Castilian succession, you consider the dynastic implications - a king should know these matters well.\n\nThe Line of Succession from Juan II of Castile (1430)\n\nYour Immediate Line:\n\nYou (Juan II, age 18, no children yet)\n\nYour sister María (Queen of Aragon, age 33, married to Alfonso V but childless after 15 years of marriage)\n\nYour sister Catherine (died in 1424, was married to Infante Henry, Duke of Villena - no surviving children)\n\nThe Uncomfortable Truth:\n\nIf you and María die without heirs, the succession becomes complicated and extremely uncomfortable:\n\nThe next legitimate male-line heirs would be... the Infantes de Aragón themselves.\n\nHere's why: Your grandfather, John I of Castile, had two sons:\n\nHenry III (your father, died 1406)\n\nFerdinand \"of Antequera\" (who became Ferdinand I of Aragon in 1412)\n\nFerdinand I's sons are:\n\nAlfonso V (current King of Aragon, married to your sister)\n\nInfante Juan (King of Navarre, the one you just tried to arrest)\n\nInfante Enrique (the other one you tried to arrest)\n\nInfante Pedro (died 1438)\n\nInfante Sancho (Master of Alcántara)\n\nSo the very men who just rebelled against you are actually your father's first cousins and stand in the line of succession. If you died without heirs, Castile might legally pass to:\n\nAlfonso V of Aragon (as eldest son of Ferdinand I)\n\nInfante Juan of Navarre\n\nInfante Enrique\n\nTheir younger brothers\n\nThe Political Explosion:\n\nThis means:\n\nThe Infantes aren't just rebellious nobles - they have royal blood and distant succession rights\n\nSome nobles might see them as legitimate alternatives if you die young\n\nYour arrest attempt could be seen as trying to eliminate rival claimants\n\nAlfonso V could potentially inherit both Castile and Aragon, uniting the crowns\n\nThis gives the Infantes a \"legitimate\" grievance - you tried to arrest potential heirs to the throne\n\nOther Possible Claimants:\n\nThrough female lines, there might be claims from:\n\nPortuguese royalty (through various Castilian-Portuguese marriages)\n\nDescendants of John of Gaunt (through your grandmother Catherine of Lancaster)\n\nOther Trastámara female-line descendants\n\nBut the strongest claim would be the Aragonese line.\n\nYour Strategic Vulnerability:\n\nAs you stand in your Barcelona chambers considering this, the full weight hits you:\n\nYou're 18 with no wife or children\n\nYou're about to embark on a dangerous crusade\n\nThe men with the best claim to succeed you are the ones you just tried to arrest\n\nEvery month you remain unmarried and childless strengthens their position\n\nIf you die in battle against Granada, Castile likely becomes part of Aragon\n\nFray Hernando, if consulted, might observe: \"Perhaps God preserved you from your feelings for Isabel for a reason. You need a political marriage that produces heirs quickly. Every day without an heir is a day the Infantes grow stronger.\"\n\nThis knowledge makes your upcoming confrontation with the Infantes even more delicate. They know what you now fully realize - they're not just nobles to be arrested. They're potential kings of Castile.\n\nWhat do you wish to do with this uncomfortable realization?"

          "text": "Alfonso V of Aragon (born 1396, so age 34 in 1430) is married to María of Castile (Juan's sister) but they have no children after 15 years of marriage. Historically, Alfonso V died without legitimate children.\n\nThe succession for the Crown of Aragon if Alfonso V and his brothers all died without heirs:\n\n1. Alfonso V - no children despite being married since 1415\n2. Infante Juan of Navarre - has a son, Carlos, Prince of Viana (age 9 in 1430)\n3. Infante Enrique - might have children?\n4. Infante Sancho - Master of Alcántara\n5. Infante Pedro - died historically in 1438\n\nWait, I established in the story that Infante Juan has a son, Carlos (age 9), the Prince of Viana. So if we're talking about all of them dying without heirs, we need to go further back.\n\nIf the entire male line of Ferdinand I of Aragon dies out, we need to look at:\n- Female lines from Ferdinand I\n- Going back to earlier Aragonese succession\n\nActually, this gets very complex. The Crown of Aragon had different succession laws than Castile. Let me think about what Juan would realistically know and what would happen.\n\nIf all of Ferdinand I's sons and grandsons died, the succession would be extremely disputed. There would be:\n- Female-line descendants of Ferdinand I\n- Claims from other branches of the House of Barcelona/Aragon\n- Possibly claims from Castile through María (Juan's sister, Alfonso's wife)\n- Claims from other royal houses\n\nThis is getting very hypothetical and Juan is clearly thinking about something here...\n\nYou lean back in your chair, mind racing through the dynastic implications. A hypothetical question, but kings must think in hypotheticals.\n\nThe Aragonese Succession Question\n\nCurrent Line of Succession for Aragon:\n\nAlfonso V (age 34, childless after 15 years of marriage to your sister María)\n\nInfante Juan of Navarre (has a son: Carlos, Prince of Viana, age 9)\n\nInfante Enrique (no legitimate children known)\n\nInfante Sancho (Master of Alcántara, no children)\n\nInfante Pedro (still alive, no significant offspring)\n\nSo currently, if Alfonso V dies, the crown passes to Infante Juan, then to young Carlos of Viana.\n\nBut If They All Died Without Heirs...\n\nThe succession becomes incredibly murky. Ferdinand I (their father) took the Aragonese throne through the Compromise of Caspe in 1412, but he was himself a Castilian prince. If his entire line fails...\n\nPotential Claimants Would Include:\n\nYour sister María - As Alfonso V's widow, she might claim the throne in her own right (Aragon has had ruling queens before, like Petronilla)\n\nYou yourself - Through your sister's marriage and as grandson of Catherine of Lancaster, you'd have a claim\n\nThe House of Urgell - They contested Ferdinand I's succession in 1412. James II, Count of Urgell, fought a war over it. His descendants might revive their claim.\n\nVarious Catalan noble houses - Who trace descent from earlier kings of Aragon\n\nEven France might assert some ancient claim through old marriages\n\nThe Strategic Implications:\n\nAs this thought experiment unfolds in your mind, several realizations dawn:\n\nIf the male Aragonese line died out:\n\nYour sister María could potentially become Queen of Aragon in her own right\n\nYou could press a claim through her\n\nCastile and Aragon might unite under your house, not theirs\n\nThe Crown of Aragon includes Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Valencia, Catalonia - vast territories\n\nThe Uncomfortable Mirror:\n\nJust as the Infantes stand to inherit Castile if you die without heirs...\n\nYou could potentially inherit Aragon if they all died without heirs\n\nBoth kingdoms' successions are precariously intertwined\n\nBoth sides have incentive to ensure the other doesn't produce heirs\n\nWhy This Matters Now:\n\nSir Thomas, if present, might observe: \"Your Majesty, purely hypothetically... if something happened to all the Aragonese princes during, say, a dangerous military campaign like a crusade, and your sister survived as Alfonso's widow...\"\n\nFray Hernando would immediately interject: \"That line of thinking leads to dark places, Your Majesty.\"\n\nBut the political reality is clear:\n\nThe Infantes aren't just your rivals - they're blocking your potential inheritance of Aragon\n\nYou're not just their rival - you're blocking their potential inheritance of Castile\n\nYour sister María sits at the center of both succession questions\n\nEvery major noble in both kingdoms knows this\n\nThe Current Wild Card:\n\nYoung Carlos, Prince of Viana (age 9) - Infante Juan's son. He's the only child in the next generation on either side. If he survives to adulthood, he could inherit:\n\nNavarre (from his father)\n\nPotentially Aragon (if Alfonso dies childless)\n\nPotentially Castile (if you die childless)\n\nUnless you have children. Soon.\n\nThe Dangerous Game:\n\nThis succession tangle means:\n\nEvery military campaign carries dynastic implications\n\nEvery marriage negotiation affects both kingdoms\n\nEvery feast, every hunt, every voyage risks changing everything\n\nThe Infantes' rebellion wasn't just about power - it was about positioning for potential inheritance\n\nYour arrest order looked like trying to eliminate rival heirs\n\nAs you consider this in Barcelona - in Alfonso V's own city, surrounded by Aragonese nobles who all understand these implications - you realize everyone is watching you very, very carefully.\n\n\"Purely hypothetical,\" you might say aloud. But Diego, your secretary, would know to burn any papers with these calculations. Some hypotheticals are too dangerous to commit to writing.\n\nWhat would you like to do with these dynastic insights?"

The journey from Barcelona to Seville, while requiring passage through the Strait of Gibraltar, is a regular trade route.\n\nGiven the planning, multiple ships, and the fact that this is a relatively routine voyage (though with precious cargo), I'd say this is \"Likely to succeed\" - not guaranteed, but the precautions taken should be sufficient for a safe journey under normal circumstances.\n\nLooking at your planned voyage from Barcelona to Seville with three ships, let me assess the probability of success.\n\nProbability Assessment: Likely to succeed\n\nFactors in Your Favor:\n\nStrong Security Measures:\n\nThree ships traveling together - mutual defense capability\n\n62 trained crusaders plus experienced guards\n\nRodrigo, García, Sir Thomas commanding security\n\nFour dedicated guards on permanent rotation for the relics\n\nShips can support each other if one has trouble\n\nGood Timing & Conditions:\n\nMid-September: generally favorable sailing weather in the Western Mediterranean\n\nWell-traveled trade route from Barcelona around to Seville\n\nExperienced Catalan captains who know these waters\n\nThe grape harvest season means heavy merchant traffic to blend with\n\nElement of Discretion:\n\nWhile three ships are noticeable, they're not flying royal banners\n\nCould appear as normal merchant convoy\n\nGranada's naval forces likely concentrated near their own waters\n\nNo indication your specific departure date is known to enemies\n\nPotential Dangers:\n\nMaritime Risks:\n\nThe Strait of Gibraltar is always dangerous - currents, winds, and narrow passage\n\nCorsair activity possible, especially North African raiders\n\nSeptember can bring sudden storms in the Mediterranean\n\nThree ships must stay together, slowing to pace of slowest vessel\n\nEnemy Intelligence:\n\nThe Infantes know you're in Barcelona (their agents watched)\n\nGranada has 20-25 war galleys from Muslim allies\n\nYour valuable cargo would be an incredible prize if identified\n\nSome pirates might take three ships as challenge rather than deterrent\n\nPolitical Complications:\n\nMust pass through waters near Granada's influence\n\nAragonese ships might be tracking your departure\n\nNews travels fast along the coast\n\nAssessment:\n\nYour precautions are sound. Three ships with trained fighters and experienced guards should handle normal maritime threats. The route, while long, is regularly traveled. Your security measures for the relics are excellent. The main vulnerabilities are the Strait of Gibraltar passage and the possibility of concentrated enemy action if your identity is discovered.\n\nHowever, unless you encounter a major Granada naval squadron or severe weather, your force should reach Seville successfully.\n\nPlease roll your dice to determine the outcome of your voyage."

          "text": "The Voyage to Seville\n\nSeptember 18-28, 1430\n\nDeparture from Barcelona (September 18, Dawn)\n\nThe three galleys waited at Barcelona's main quay as morning mist rolled off the Mediterranean. You'd hired experienced Catalan captains:\n\nSanta Eulalia (flagship) - Captain Ramon Berenguer, 40 oars\n\nSant Jordi - Captain Pere Marquet, 35 oars\n\nMare de Déu - Captain Arnau Sabater, 35 oars\n\nYour crusaders boarded in good order. The weeks of training showed - they moved like soldiers now, not the ragged volunteers who'd arrived. Their white tabards with red crosses caught the early sunlight.\n\nMaría came to see you off, accompanied by several nobles from the Consell Reial. She embraced you formally, then whispered: \"The ashes are gone, hermano. Let the wind take the rest of your grief.\"\n\nAs the Santa Eulalia pulled away from the quay, you stood at the stern watching Barcelona recede. Somewhere in that city, Isabel was probably just waking. You turned your face to the sea.\n\nThe First Days (September 18-20)\n\nThe three ships maintained close formation, never more than a quarter-mile apart. Captain Berenguer proved excellent - he'd clearly managed convoy escort before.\n\nYour crusaders adapted to shipboard life with varying success. The former mercenary Marco barely noticed the ship's roll. Pietro vomited for two days straight but kept trying to stand watch. Brother Guillem led prayers at dawn and dusk, his clear voice carrying across the water to the other ships.\n\nOn the second evening, Captain Berenguer pointed to distant sails. \"Fishing boats, Your Majesty. But see how they're not actually fishing? They're watching. By tomorrow, every port from here to Valencia will know three ships passed south in formation.\"\n\n\"Is that a problem?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. But we're not invisible.\"\n\nThe Challenge at Valencia (September 21)\n\nValencia's harbor authorities tried to insist you anchor for \"inspection.\" Three war galleys emerged to encourage compliance.\n\nCaptain Berenguer looked to you. \"We can outrun them, but it would confirm we're carrying something valuable. Or we can bluff.\"\n\nYou chose to bluff. Standing visible on deck in your white garments (but not displaying the banner), you had Berenguer signal: \"Crusaders bound for Seville under papal authority. Interference with holy mission carries excommunication.\"\n\nThe Valencian galleys held position for a tense hour. Your crusaders lined the rails, hands on weapons but not drawn. Finally, the Valencian commander signaled: \"Pass in peace. God speed your holy work.\"\n\nAs Valencia fell behind, Sir Thomas observed: \"That commander will still report three ships of crusaders heading south. Word will reach Granada before we do.\"\n\nThe Corsair Encounter (September 23)\n\nOff the coast near Cartagena, two sleek vessels emerged from a hidden cove - Barbary corsairs, swift and predatory. They'd clearly been tracking you since dawn.\n\n\"They're testing us,\" Captain Berenguer said. \"Seeing if we'll scatter.\"\n\nThe corsairs swept closer, within crossbow range. You could see their crews - a mix of Berbers, renegade Christians, and sub-Saharan Africans. Professional pirates.\n\nYou made a decision. \"Unfurl the banner. Let them see what they're considering attacking.\"\n\nWhen the white silk unfurled with the golden reliquary of the True Cross gleaming in the sunlight, an extraordinary thing happened. Several of the corsair crew visibly stepped back. You heard arguing on their deck. Their captain - a gray-bearded Berber - stood at his bow staring at the banner for a long moment.\n\nThen he raised his hand in what might have been salute or acknowledgment, and both corsair vessels sheared off, disappearing southward.\n\nFray Hernando murmured: \"Even pirates fear God sometimes. Or perhaps they fear the consequences of attacking a ship bearing the True Cross.\"\n\n\"Or,\" Rodrigo added pragmatically, \"they decided three ships full of armed crusaders wasn't worth the cost.\"\n\nThe Strait of Gibraltar (September 25)\n\nThe most dangerous part of your voyage. The narrow passage between Christendom and Islam, where Atlantic meets Mediterranean, where currents can smash ships against rocks and where Granada's allies waited.\n\nFive Moroccan war galleys patrolled the southern approach.\n\nCaptain Berenguer gathered the three captains. \"We can wait for night, try to slip through in darkness. Or we run the strait in daylight, counting on speed and formation.\"\n\nYou chose daylight. \"We're not smugglers. We're crusaders under papal authority.\"\n\nThe run through the strait was harrowing. The Moroccan galleys shadowed you the entire way, maintaining perfect position to intercept if you tried to land on the African coast. Your crusaders stood to arms for six straight hours. The banner remained visible, relics gleaming.\n\nAt the narrowest point, one Moroccan galley surged forward as if to ram, then veered off at the last moment - a test of nerve. Your formation held.\n\nAs you entered the Atlantic, the Moroccan squadron fell back. They'd delivered their message: We're watching. We're ready.\n\nThe Atlantic Coast (September 26-27)\n\nThe weather turned rough as you sailed north along the Atlantic coast toward Seville. Not a full storm, but heavy seas that had your landlubber crusaders groaning in misery.\n\nPietro, green-faced but determined, asked: \"Your Majesty, how do you stand it?\"\n\n\"I think about where we're going,\" you replied. \"Each wave brings us closer to Seville. Closer to the Council. Closer to beginning God's work.\"\n\nDuring the worst of the weather, you found Giovanni the blacksmith at the rail, not seasick but praying steadily. \"For safe voyage?\" you asked.\n\n\"No, Your Majesty. Thanking God for the storm.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because if He sends storms, it means He's watching. He hasn't forgotten us.\"\n\nSimple faith, but it moved you.\n\nArrival at Seville (September 28, Afternoon)\n\nThe Guadalquivir River's mouth appeared through morning haze. Your three ships turned upriver, oars beating steadily against the current.\n\nAs you approached Seville, the city's bells began ringing - not alarm, but welcome. Word had preceded you. Crowds gathered along the riverbanks. Your crusaders stood straighter, white tabards bright despite the voyage.\n\nThen you saw him: Álvaro de Luna waited at the main dock with a small honor guard. His face was carefully composed, but you knew him well enough to see the relief.\n\nAs the Santa Eulalia tied up, Álvaro called out: \"Your Majesty! Thanks be to God for your safe return.\"\n\nYou stepped onto the dock - Castilian soil after five months away. Álvaro dropped to one knee formally, then rose and embraced you, whispering urgently: \"We must talk immediately. The Infantes refused arrest. They're fortified and defiant. The realm holds, but barely. And there's more - Granada's embassy arrived three days ago. They're waiting to see you.\"\n\nBehind Álvaro, you noticed several richly dressed Moors watching from a balcony. The Granadan delegation, studying their future opponent.\n\nYou nodded to Álvaro but kept your voice carrying: \"We have returned with God's blessing and the Pope's commission. Let all of Seville know - the King is home, and the crusade shall begin!\"\n\nThe crowd erupted in cheers. Your 62 crusaders disembarked in formation, their disciplined appearance causing murmurs of approval. When Rodrigo and García brought the banner-chest containing the relics, people dropped to their knees.\n\nBut even as you waved to the crowd, Álvaro's urgent expression told you everything: You'd returned not to a united kingdom ready for crusade, but to a realm on the edge of civil war.\n\nYour successful voyage is complete. You've arrived in Seville with:\n\nAll 62 crusaders safe and accounted for\n\nThe sacred relics and papal bull secure\n\nYour military equipment and treasury intact\n\nYour reputation enhanced by the disciplined arrival\n\nFive weeks until the November 8 Royal Council\n\nBut the challenges awaiting you are severe:\n\nThe Infantes remain free and defiant\n\nGranada's embassy is here with an offer\n\nThe nobility questions your authority\n\nCivil war threatens\n\nWhat is your first action upon landing in Seville?"

          "text": "Juan has just arrived in Seville and wants to speak with Álvaro de Luna privately first before dealing with the Granada delegation. This makes sense - he needs to understand the full situation before making any diplomatic moves. He's being cautious about security too, wanting a safe location for the discussion.\n\nLet me describe Álvaro taking Juan to a secure location and briefing him on the situation in detail.\n\nÁlvaro nods sharply, immediately understanding. \"Diego,\" he calls to your secretary, \"Send word to the Granadan delegation that His Majesty acknowledges their presence and will grant them audience once he has attended to urgent matters of state. They've waited three days; a few more hours won't matter.\"\n\nHe turns to Rodrigo. \"Captain, secure the relics in the cathedral treasury. Four guards at all times. Nobody touches them without His Majesty's direct presence.\"\n\n\"Sir Thomas,\" Álvaro continues, \"see to quartering the crusaders. The Alcázar's outer barracks are prepared.\"\n\nThen quietly to you: \"Come. We'll go to the Torre del Oro. It's secure, and we won't be overheard.\"\n\nThe Torre del Oro - Secure Conference\n\nThe Tower of Gold, Seville's famous defensive tower by the river, has a chamber at its top used for the most sensitive discussions. Álvaro has posted his most trusted men at every level. Only the two of you stand in the circular room, windows showing the Guadalquivir below.\n\nÁlvaro pours wine from a flask he brought himself - taking no chances with poison. His face, now that you're alone, shows the strain of the past months.\n\n\"Juan,\" he says, dropping formality. \"Thank God you're back. First, the good - you should know what you achieved. The papal bull is already legend. Cardinal Orsini wrote to the Archbishop of Toledo describing your... presentation to the Pope. The story has spread everywhere. Half of Castile thinks you're a living saint. The other half thinks you're mad, but even they're impressed by the audacity.\"\n\nHe drinks deeply. \"Now the bad. The Infantes didn't just refuse arrest - they've been actively building a coalition against you. They claim the arrest order was forged by me, that you're either dead, imprisoned, or lost in religious mania. About eight noble houses believe them. Another thirty are waiting to see proof you're actually in command.\"\n\nÁlvaro moves to a map on the table. \"Here's where we stand militarily.\" He points to various positions:\n\n\"The Infantes control:\n\nArévalo fortress\n\nTwo minor castles here and here\n\nTheir own estates, heavily fortified\n\nAbout 5,000 troops total\n\nMaster of Santiago supports them with another 2,000\n\nWe control:\n\nAll major cities\n\nThe royal administration\n\nAbout 3,000 royal troops\n\nThe loyalty of about 15-20 noble houses who could raise maybe 8,000 more\n\nMasters of Calatrava and Alcántara remain neutral but lean toward us\n\nThe problem: If we move against the Infantes militarily, it's civil war. Alfonso V has already threatened to intervene from Aragon if his brothers are harmed. We'd win eventually, but the cost...\"\n\nHe pauses, then adds grimly: \"And that's before we consider Granada. Juan, their delegation isn't just here to negotiate. They arrived with disturbing news. The Sultan has received massive support from across the Muslim world - Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, even the Ottomans. They have gold, troops, and ships we didn't expect. Our spies report at least 20,000 troops gathering in Granada, with modern Ottoman cannon.\"\n\nÁlvaro refills his cup. \"The Granadan ambassador, Abu Abdullah al-Zaghal, is clever. He's been very visible in Seville, visiting churches, speaking with merchants, being conspicuously peaceful. He's brought gifts worth a fortune. The message is clear: Granada wants peace and is strong enough to enforce it.\"\n\nHe looks at you directly. \"The November 8 Council is ten days away. Every major noble will attend - including the Infantes, who claim they're coming to 'protect the realm from false orders.' If you appear weak, if the kingdom looks divided, the crusade dies before it begins. Worse, we might face civil war.\"\n\n\"But,\" Álvaro adds with a slight smile, \"you have advantages they don't expect. The papal bull is real and spectacular. The True Cross and Santiago's bone - nobody can argue with those. Your 62 crusaders made an impression arriving in formation. And most importantly, you're here, alive, clearly in command. That alone destroys half the Infantes' arguments.\"\n\nHe leans against the window. \"So, my king, my friend - what's our strategy? Do we:\n\nTry to reconcile with the Infantes before the Council? Offer them something to stand down?\n\nPrepare for confrontation at the Council? Use the papal authority to override their political maneuvering?\n\nDeal with Granada first? If we could secure peace or alliance there, it would free us to handle the Infantes?\n\nSomething else entirely?\n\nThe realm needs you to be brilliant, Juan. What the Pope gave you is powerful, but it's not enough by itself. How do we turn this situation to our advantage?\"\n\nÁlvaro waits, watching you with the keen intelligence that has kept him alive through decades of court intrigue. Below, the Guadalquivir flows toward the sea, and somewhere in the city, Granadan diplomats and the Infantes' agents are making their own plans.\n\nWhat is your strategic decision?"

          "text": "Juan is asking whether it's public knowledge that the Infantes were ordered to surrender themselves for trial. This is important for understanding the political situation and how the arrest order has been perceived.\n\nBased on the narrative so far:\n- Álvaro made a public summons on September 5th in Valladolid's main square\n- Heralds proclaimed that the Infantes were summoned to present themselves to royal justice\n- The proclamation was copied and sent to every major city in Castile\n- The Infantes publicly responded on September 7th, denying charges and refusing to surrender to Álvaro\n- They sent copies of their response to major noble houses, the Archbishop, and Alfonso V\n\nSo yes, it's very much public knowledge that they were ordered to surrender and refused.\n\nÁlvaro nods grimly. \"Oh yes, it's known. I made sure of that. On September 5th, I had heralds proclaim the summons in Valladolid's main square and sent copies to every major city. The charges were explicit - rebellion, seizure of royal property, conspiracy against the crown. They had ten days to surrender themselves peacefully.\"\n\nHe pulls out a document from his pouch. \"And here's where they made a mistake. They responded publicly, in writing. Listen to this part: 'We question the legitimacy of orders issued in the King's absence and demand to see His Majesty personally before submitting to any proceedings. We will not surrender ourselves to Don Álvaro de Luna, whom we consider party to this conflict rather than neutral arbiter.'\"\n\nÁlvaro sets the document down. \"They sent copies to every noble house, the Archbishop of Toledo, even Alfonso V in Naples. So yes, everyone knows they were ordered to appear for trial and refused. They've tried to spin it as refusing to submit to me rather than to you, but the fact remains - they defied a royal summons.\"\n\nHe leans forward. \"This is actually one of our advantages, Juan. They're in open defiance of royal justice. They can claim the orders were illegitimate, but now you're here. You can confirm the orders were real. That makes them rebels who refused legitimate royal summons. Even their supporters will have difficulty arguing against that.\"\n\n\"The question is how to use this. Some of the neutral nobles are disturbed that the Infantes refused to even appear for trial. As several have said privately - if they were innocent, why not come and defend themselves? Their refusal makes them look guilty, even to those who might sympathize with their complaints about me.\"\n\nÁlvaro's eyes sharpen. \"If you publicly confirm at the Council that you personally ordered their arrest, that you stand behind the charges, it puts them in a difficult position. They either submit to trial or confirm themselves as rebels before the entire realm. But it also risks pushing them to desperate action.\"\n\n\"What do you think? Should we use their public refusal against them?\""

Why would they be allowed to come to the Royal Council? Let me think through the practical and political realities here.\n\n1. The Infantes have military forces - they're not just walking around unprotected. They likely travel with armed retinues.\n\n2. They're princes of Aragon - arresting them could trigger war with Aragon\n\n3. They've claimed they'll come to the Council to \"protect the realm\" - so they're positioning themselves as coming to participate, not as rebels\n\n4. The practical reality of medieval justice - you need force to arrest someone with their own army\n\n5. The political question - attempting to arrest them at the Council could turn the Council into a battlefield\n\nThis is a good strategic question from Juan - why give them legitimacy by letting them attend?\n\nÁlvaro's expression shifts - surprise, then consideration, then a slow nod of respect.\n\n\"Christ's blood, you're right. Every moment we don't arrest them, we legitimize them.\" He starts pacing. \"If a common lord refused royal summons, we'd have men hunting him across Castile. But the Infantes? We let them move freely, gather support, even come to the Royal Council?\"\n\nHe stops at the window. \"Here's the ugly truth: They have 5,000 troops. When they travel, they move with at least 500 armed men. To arrest them 'on sight' means attacking their escort. That's a battle, not an arrest. Blood in the streets of Seville if they come here.\"\n\n\"But you're raising a crucial point,\" Álvaro continues, turning back. \"If we let them walk into the Royal Council as if they're legitimate participants rather than fugitives from justice... we've already lost. Every noble will see that royal summons can be ignored if you have enough swords.\"\n\nHe thinks intensely. \"What if... what if we make the arrest warrant public here in Seville, today? You personally, visibly, confirm the orders. Anyone who aids or shelters them is guilty of harboring rebels. Then:\n\nIf they come to the Council, they must come under flag of truce to surrender themselves\n\nIf they come armed and defiant, they mark themselves as rebels before everyone\n\nIf they don't come, they've abandoned any claim to legitimacy\n\nWe could send heralds today to every approaching road: 'The Infantes de Aragón are commanded to surrender themselves to royal justice. Any who enter Seville must do so unarmed and prepared to answer charges.'\"\n\nÁlvaro's eyes gleam. \"It's aggressive. It might provoke them. But you're right - every day we treat them as princes rather than rebels, we weaken royal authority. What do you command?\""

Juan would need to consider this carefully.\n\nÁlvaro nods approvingly. \"Yes, your personal confirmation would make it undeniable. We'll gather the nobles tonight - most are already here for the Council anyway.\"\n\nThen his expression turns grave at your second question. \"The punishment for rebellion... technically it's death, Juan. Treason against the crown is a capital crime. But...\"\n\nHe walks to the map again, staring at it. \"These aren't ordinary nobles. They're Infantes of Aragon, royal blood. Alfonso V's brothers. If we execute them, it means war with Aragon, possibly Navarre too. No question.\"\n\n\"Historically, when dealing with rebellious royal princes, kings have chosen alternatives:\n\nExile - Banishment from Castile permanently\n\nLoss of all Castilian titles and lands - Strip them of everything they hold from you\n\nImprisonment - Usually in comfortable but secure confinement\n\nForced religious life - Making them take holy orders, enter a monastery\n\nMassive fines - Bankrupt them but leave them alive\n\nOr combinations thereof.\"\n\nÁlvaro turns to you. \"If I may be frank? The smartest punishment would be: Strip them of all Castilian lands and titles, exile them permanently, and let them keep their lives and Aragonese holdings. They become Alfonso's problem, not ours. We look merciful but firm.\"\n\n\"But if you want to make an example...\" he pauses. \"Imprisonment until they publicly swear loyalty and renounce all claims to influence in Castile. Then exile. It shows strength without forcing Alfonso to invade to save his brothers' lives.\"\n\n\"The key is this - whatever you threaten must be something you're willing to actually do. If you threaten death but everyone knows you won't follow through, you look weak. If you threaten exile and they call your bluff, you must be ready to enforce it.\"\n\n\"What sounds right to you? And remember - you don't have to announce the specific punishment now. You can simply confirm they must answer charges of rebellion, and let them wonder what that might mean.\"\n\nÁlvaro adds: \"Shall I summon the nobles for this evening?

Juan cannot force them to renounce Aragonese succession rights - that's entirely outside his jurisdiction as King of Castile\n4. This would be like the King of France trying to force an English prince to renounce his rights to the English throne - no legal authority\n\nThis is actually a very astute observation from Juan, recognizing the long-term dynastic threat. Álvaro would understand this immediately but also recognize the impossibility.\n\nÁlvaro's eyes widen, then he shakes his head slowly. \"Christ, you see it too. If Alfonso dies without heir - and after fifteen years of marriage to your sister, that seems likely - Infante Juan inherits Aragon. Then we face not just a hostile noble but a hostile king on our border.\"\n\nHe pours more wine, thinking hard. \"But here's the problem: You're King of Castile, not Aragon. You have no authority over Aragonese succession. It would be like Alfonso trying to make you renounce your claim to Castile. Even if they signed such a renunciation under duress, it would be meaningless. The Cortes of Aragon wouldn't recognize it. The Pope wouldn't enforce it. Alfonso would declare it void immediately.\"\n\n\"The only ways to permanently remove their threat are...\" Álvaro pauses, clearly uncomfortable. \"Death. Imprisonment for life. Or...\"\n\nHe stops, then continues carefully. \"Or force them into religious orders. A monk cannot inherit a crown. If they took holy vows, genuine ones before bishops, they'd be removed from succession. But forcing that would still likely mean war with Alfonso.\"\n\nÁlvaro walks to the window again. \"There's another angle. Your sister María. She's Alfonso's queen. If the male line of Aragon fails, she might have a claim. Some would support a female ruler rather than see the crown pass to brothers who betrayed their nephew.\"\n\n\"But that's all future speculation. Right now, we can only deal with their Castilian rebellion. We can't solve the Aragonese succession problem through this trial.\"\n\nHe turns back to you. \"Unless... Juan, what if we offered them a choice? Full pardon and keep their Castilian lands if they voluntarily take religious vows? Frame it as mercy - letting them serve God rather than face execution for treason? It would remove them from both Castilian politics and Aragonese succession.\"\n\n\"Though I doubt they'd accept. They know their value as Alfonso's potential heirs.\""

I need to be realistic about what would happen if he chose this path.\n\nLet me think through the consequences:\n1. War with Aragon - almost certain\n2. Pope's reaction - would be severe given Juan has papal backing for crusade\n3. Castilian nobility reaction - would be shocked and terrified\n4. Historical precedent - executing royal princes is extremely rare\n5. His sister María's position - she's married to Alfonso V\n\nThis would be a catastrophic decision but I should explain why honestly rather than just say \"don't do it.\"\n\nÁlvaro goes very still. For a moment, the only sound is the river below. When he speaks, his voice is carefully controlled.\n\n\"You could. Legally, you'd be within your rights. They rebelled, seized royal fortresses, refused lawful summons. The sentence for treason is death.\"\n\nHe takes a deep breath. \"But Juan... the consequences would be catastrophic. Let me be absolutely clear about what would happen:\n\nImmediately:\n\nAlfonso V would declare war. Not threaten - declare. His brothers' heads would mean Spanish blood for a generation.\n\nYour sister María would become a widow or a hostage in her own court. Alfonso might even blame her.\n\nEvery noble in Castile would be terrified. If royal blood doesn't protect the Infantes, no one is safe. Some would rebel out of pure fear.\n\nThe Pope would be horrified. You just knelt naked before him, and now you execute princes? He might revoke the crusade bull entirely.\n\nWithin weeks:\n\nAragonese armies would invade from three directions - Aragon proper, Valencia, and Navarre (which Infante Juan rules)\n\nPortugal might join them, seeing an unstable Castile as a threat\n\nFrance might support Aragon to weaken Castile\n\nGranada would attack our southern frontier while we're fighting Aragon\n\nThe realm would tear itself apart.\"\n\nÁlvaro moves closer, his voice urgent. \"Juan, I've served your father and you. I've done harsh things to protect the crown. But executing the Infantes would destroy everything. We'd face:\n\nCivil war as nobles choose sides\n\nForeign invasion from Aragon\n\nGranada conquering the south\n\nPossible excommunication for executing princes who are also Alfonso's brothers\n\nYou'd be remembered as the king who destroyed Castile over a failed rebellion that we'd already contained.\"\n\nHe grabs your shoulders. \"Listen - Henry IV of England executed an Archbishop once. It destroyed his reputation forever. These are princes of royal blood. Even attempting it... Juan, the men ordered to carry out the execution might refuse. Christian knights executing Christian princes? Some would choose death over that stain.\"\n\n\"Is removing them worth losing your kingdom? Your crusade? Everything?\""

He departs noting that Juan's promise to protect surrendered Muslims is 'unexpected and will be remembered.' The diplomatic option is closed; war is inevitable.",

I'll have the nobles assembled in the Alcázar's great hall by sunset - that gives us about four hours. The Archbishop of Toledo will be there, which adds weight.\"\n\nHe moves toward the door, then turns back. \"The Granadan delegation... Juan, before you meet them, you should know what they've already shown publicly. They've brought gifts worth at least 20,000 dinars - silks, manuscripts, jeweled weapons. They've been praying openly at their residence, but also visiting our churches, speaking respectfully of Christianity. Their leader, Abu Abdullah al-Zaghal, is no fool. He's been building sympathy.\"\n\n\"They're staying at the Casa de los Abades, the old merchant palace. Shall I send word you'll receive them here in the Torre del Oro, or would you prefer the formal throne room at the Alcázar?\"\n\nÁlvaro pauses. \"Also... Fray Hernando should probably be present. A Granadan peace offer versus a crusade bull - the spiritual implications are significant. And maybe Sir Thomas? He's fought Muslims before, might catch military details we'd miss.\"\n\n\"One more thing,\" he adds. \"The Granadans certainly have spies. By tonight, they'll know you've confirmed the arrest warrant for the Infantes. They'll see Castile as divided, weak. They might adjust their offer accordingly - or try to exploit our division.\"\n\nHe waits for your decision. \"Where do you want to receive them, and who should be present?\""

This is a power move - showing strength and divine authority rather than meeting them privately. Let me set this scene appropriately.\n\nHe's choosing to make this a formal state reception rather than a private negotiation. The timing is interesting - he's doing this before the evening meeting with nobles about the Infantes. \n\nI should:\n1. Describe the preparation of the throne room\n2. Set up the impressive display of the sacred items\n3. Show the Granadan delegation's arrival and reaction\n4. Begin the diplomatic encounter\n\nThis is a significant moment - the first meeting between Juan and Granada since he received the crusade bull.\n\nÁlvaro nods approvingly. \"A formal reception. Good. Let them see the full majesty of Castile and God's mandate. I'll send word immediately and have the throne room prepared.\"\n\nThe Alcázar Throne Room - Early Afternoon\n\nWithin an hour, the great throne room of Seville's Alcázar has been transformed. You sit on the throne of Castile, wearing clean white garments with your father's sword across your lap. Behind you, mounted on a tall stand, the white banner blazes in the afternoon sunlight streaming through high windows. The gold reliquary of the True Cross and silver reliquary of Saint James's bone catch the light like stars.\n\nTo your right stands Fray Hernando in his simple Hieronymite robes. To your left, Álvaro de Luna in the rich dress of the Constable. Sir Thomas Beaumont stands with the guard, his scarred face impassive. Rodrigo and García flank the banner itself, hands on sword hilts.\n\nThe papal bull, with its heavy lead seal, rests on a cushion on a small table beside the throne - visible to all who approach.\n\nCourtiers line the walls. Word has spread quickly, and perhaps sixty nobles and churchmen have gathered to witness this meeting. The Archbishop of Toledo stands among them, watching carefully.\n\nThe great doors open. A herald announces: \"The embassy of the Sultan of Granada!\"\n\nThe Granadan Delegation Enters\n\nTwelve men enter in formation. Their leader, Abu Abdullah al-Zaghal, is perhaps fifty, with intelligent dark eyes and a carefully groomed gray beard. He wears rich but not ostentatious robes of deep blue silk. His companions include scribes, two who are clearly military observers, and one who might be a scholar or imam.\n\nThey carry three ornate chests - their gifts.\n\nAs they advance down the long hall, you see the moment al-Zaghal notices the banner and relics. His step doesn't falter, but his eyes narrow slightly. When he sees the papal bull, his expression becomes even more careful.\n\nHe stops at the appropriate distance and bows - correctly, respectfully, but not subserviently.\n\n\"Your Majesty Juan, King of Castile and León, I bring greetings from my lord Muhammad IX, Sultan of Granada, Defender of the Faithful, Lord of Málaga and Almería. May peace be upon this gathering.\"\n\nHis Castilian is flawless, with only the slightest accent.\n\n\"My Sultan sends these humble gifts as a token of our desire for continued peace between our realms.\" He gestures, and his men open the chests, revealing:\n\nBolts of silk that shimmer like water\n\nAn illuminated Quran with covers of gold and ivory (bold to bring to a Christian court)\n\nA sword with a damascene blade and jeweled hilt\n\nAn astrolabe of brass and silver, incredibly intricate\n\nSeveral manuscripts on mathematics and astronomy\n\nAl-Zaghal continues: \"My Sultan has heard of Your Majesty's... spiritual journey. We congratulate you on receiving the blessing of your Holy Father. Yet we come to remind you that Granada has been home to Muslims, Christians, and Jews for seven centuries. Many arrangements are possible between men of wisdom.\"\n\nHe pauses, choosing his words carefully. \"My Sultan offers this: Double the current tribute, from 50,000 to 100,000 gold dinars annually. Free passage for Christian merchants in our lands. The return of all Christian captives currently held - some 300 souls. Permission for Christian priests to minister to Christians living in Granada. All this, in exchange for continued peace.\"\n\n\"Furthermore,\" his voice takes on a slightly harder edge, \"the Sultan wishes Your Majesty to know that Granada does not stand alone. The Dar al-Islam - the house of Islam - has awakened to our situation. Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, even the mighty Ottomans have pledged their support. What might have been an easy conquest a year ago would now be a long, bloody war.\"\n\n\"Yet war serves neither of our peoples. The farmers need peace to tend their fields. The merchants need peace for trade. Mothers need peace to raise their children - both Christian and Muslim mothers weep the same tears for dead sons.\"\n\nHe gestures to the illuminated Quran. \"That holy book, which I know Your Majesty will not read, speaks of Jesus - whom we call Isa - as a great prophet. It speaks of Mary - Maryam - with reverence. We are not the pagans your ancestors fought. We worship the God of Abraham, as do you.\"\n\n\"My Sultan proposes this: Let us sign a treaty of twenty years' peace. Your Majesty can claim victory - doubled tribute, freed captives, protected Christians. You can focus on the internal matters of Castile.\" His eyes flicker meaningfully - he knows about the Infantes. \"And in twenty years, perhaps our children will find better solutions than sword and blood.\"\n\nAl-Zaghal steps back. \"This is Granada's offer, made in good faith. We come as neighbors seeking peace, not as subjects seeking mercy. What says the King of Castile?\"\n\nThe throne room is utterly silent. Everyone watches you. The papal bull gleams beside you, the True Cross blazes behind you, and before you stands an intelligent, dignified man offering you everything except the one thing the Pope commanded - the conquest of Granada.\n\nHow do you respond?"

I have come to put an end to those once and for all and end the constant raiding and tention in our lands. Both Muslims and Christians will live peacefully under christian rule.\n\n\nI let Diego read the Bull in it's entirely where I stress the treatment of converts and the prohibition of plundering. We conclude with the crusade goals, the conversion of mosques to churches, overthrowing of muslim rule and a te deum in Grenada.\n\n\nYou see my friend, you can convert today and you will fall under my protection. But we christians all know - and a spread my arms wide and gesture to the crowd - that such a command from our holy father and our lord binds us. That is why I must respectfully decline your proposal as it is in direct conflict with my sacred charge and I will never violate that. What you propose is impossible and I hope you understand this.\n\n\nI wish you well, I truly do.

Having the papal bull read in full to show his position is not negotiable\n4. Offering conversion as an alternative\n5. Being clear but not hostile\n6. Essentially ending negotiations firmly but politely\n\nI need to show how al-Zaghal responds to this - he's intelligent and came prepared for this possibility. The nobles watching will have varied reactions. This is a significant moment.\n\nThe throne room stirs with whispers as you rise and walk toward the Muslim ambassador. Several courtiers look shocked - a king leaving his throne to greet an infidel? But al-Zaghal's eyes show a flicker of genuine respect as he takes your offered hand firmly.\n\nAs Diego reads the papal bull in its entirety - a full twenty minutes of Latin translated to Castilian - you watch al-Zaghal's face. His expression never changes, but his military advisors exchange meaningful glances at certain passages. The promises of protection for converts, the prohibition of plundering, the requirement for peaceful conversion offers before military action - these are not what they expected.\n\nWhen Diego finishes with \"...a Te Deum sung in the cathedral of Granada,\" the silence is profound.\n\nAl-Zaghal nods slowly. \"Your Majesty honors us with plain speech. Let me return the courtesy.\" His voice carries clearly through the hall. \"You offer me protection if I convert today. A generous offer, personally. But I am a Muslim, as my father was, and his father before him. I will die a Muslim, God willing.\"\n\nHe steps back, addressing you but speaking to the entire court. \"You say this is a sacred charge that binds you. I understand. We too have sacred duties. And so I must tell you clearly - Granada will resist. Not from hatred of Christ, whom we revere as a prophet. Not from hatred of Christians, many of whom live peacefully in our lands. But because our faith, our law, our way of life is also sacred to us.\"\n\nThe ambassador's voice takes on a different tone - formal, almost ceremonial: \"Since you have been plain, let me be also. Granada is not the isolated city it was. Twenty thousand soldiers gather under our banner. The Maghreb sends its finest warriors. Egypt sends gold. The Ottomans send their great cannon. This will not be the easy conquest of a weak neighbor. This will be war between faiths, and such wars are the bloodiest of all.\"\n\nHe gestures to his scribes, who begin packing the gifts. \"We will take these back. They were offered in hope of peace. But know this - we also take back word of a young king who treated us with courtesy, who walked from his throne to shake a Muslim's hand, who promises protection for converts rather than slaughter.\"\n\n\"That is... unexpected. And it will be remembered.\"\n\nAl-Zaghal bows again. \"Your Majesty, I suspect we will meet again, though next time it may be across a battlefield rather than a throne room. I pray that when that day comes, we both remember this moment - when two men of different faiths spoke honestly and parted without hatred.\"\n\nHe turns to go, then pauses. \"One thing more. The internal troubles of Castile are known to us. Some in Granada counsel that we should attack while you face the Infantes. But my Sultan is honorable. We will not strike while you settle your house. But once you march south with that banner, once you cross our frontier - then we will fight with everything we have.\"\n\n\"Go with your God, Juan of Castile. You will need Him.\"\n\nThe delegation withdraws in perfect order, taking their gifts. As the doors close behind them, the throne room erupts in discussion.\n\nThe Archbishop of Toledo approaches the throne. \"Your Majesty... that was remarkably handled. Firm but not insulting. Though I confess, shaking his hand...\"\n\nSeveral younger nobles are energized, talking of crusade and glory. Others look thoughtful - al-Zaghal's warnings about Granada's strength clearly registered.\n\nÁlvaro appears at your elbow. \"Well done. You showed strength without giving them cause for immediate war. And his promise not to attack during our internal troubles - that's valuable time.\"\n\nHe lowers his voice. \"The nobles are assembled for tonight. After what they just witnessed, confirming the arrest order for the Infantes will seem like the natural next step in asserting your authority. Shall we proceed?\"\n\nFray Hernando has been silent throughout, but now speaks quietly: \"That man would have been a valuable Christian. But forced conversion is no conversion at all. You did right to let him leave in peace.\"\n\nWhat's your next action?"
