Gennadios outlines how Orthodox church can mobilize without becoming military orders—through tithes, processions, and declaring defense a sacred duty. Philanthropenos accepts the multi-front alliance concept but emphasizes Constantinople must prove itself first by bleeding the Ottomans at the walls to demonstrate serious resistance before other kingdoms will join. Juan's strategy of leveraging greed to bind allies is acknowledged as realistic. The session concludes with plans to continue developing the framework with nobles, guilds, and commoners.",
