A warning I take very seriously and will not go unheeded. My greatest fear is that my commitment will actually hurt the resolution of the conflict. Personally, nobles profiting from this rebellion goes against every grain of moral and virtue that I hold dear.\n\nA general only makes a battleplan when he arrives on the battlefield. Without knowing the battlefield yet, I cannot tell you how I will win should I even have to march against them. I am merely expressing my willingness to fight injustice, especially when the Church is involved.\n\nShould the moment arrive when you feel our interests align that you would allow me and my armies free passage, this would overcome an important hurdle for me and would signal your support for me. I place no expectation on this request and look forward to meeting you personally, God willing in good health and circumstance.\n\nI congratulate you with your coronation and wish you all the best.\n\nJuan II of Castile."

Not the dignified tears of formal mourning, but the ragged, silent sobs of a man pushed beyond endurance. His lips moved in prayer, but no sound emerged.

In your case, I seek not a reward per se, but we must discuss the new situation we create. Will my help create a permanent dependency on Castile? And even with every good will in the world, is Castile able to maintain this aid across generations? I can empty the treasury because it is mine to give, but even I cannot command my people to fight and die for a far and foreign land indefinitely? How strong is the Byzantine Empire and is just one strong push enough for help? Do not get me wrong, I do want to help. But I do have to ask the hard questions as well. Can Constantinople even be saved? And what do we have to do to make it so? To be concrete, must I create a new order and permanently station them in Constantinople? How big must they be and is the emperor prepared to allow this? Can Latin Christians settle in the city?"

With your thousand knights and sixty thousand florins, with walls repaired and professional soldiers on the ramparts, we could break a siege. The Sultan would bleed. He might withdraw, regroup, wait for better opportunity. But if you mean 'can the Byzantine Empire return to its former strength'—no. That empire is gone.

But a permanent military order? Knights who hold lands in Constantinople, who answer to their Order's Master rather than the Emperor, who maintain Latin rites in an Orthodox city? This is... complicated. We remember the Latin Empire. When the Fourth Crusade conquered us, they established a Latin Patriarch. Latin knights held Greek lands.

Can Castile commit to such a war? Can any Western power? You speak of tens of thousands of troops, years of campaigning, fortunes spent. Emperor Sigismund tried and failed.

It buys us time for you, for the Byzantine Empire, to make a choice. A choice about their future. The first choice is keep doing what we are doing right now. I support you and we delay the inevitable. We fight and die honourably in the defence of Christendom in the east. There is honour and simplicity in this, but the Empire would simply end. If we want to prevent this, far far more is needed. The second choice is migration. I offer every citizen of the empire refuge in my lands. An enormous operation, but together we can build and expand existing cities where your culture can bloom and blossom. not an empire of your own but living as respected brothers in my kingdom where we can honour God side by side. The third choice is the most ambitious and the most uncertain. We fight. We fight and we drive them from the continent completely. I am prepared to, but this will be extremely difficult. And if the empire does indeed wish this, it will be extremely dependant on Castilian aid and military security. It will require extraordinary effort on my part and on that of my kingdom. If we should decide to fight beyond the aid already given, I am only willing to give it if there is an actual chance of victory. I will regard this ask and cry for help for what it is: 'Help us please, for we cannot save ourselves.' I would have to think about what this would even look like, but I would require complete control and authority over the entire campaign. And the Byzantines themselves would be prepared as well to fight for their very survival as well. I hope you can see that from my perspective, these are the only best choices before us. And please understand that I do not want to extract things from you when your backs are against the wall. This is what I propose we do: I will instruct an expedition to be formed of 1000 of my best and most zealous order members. They will be led by officers trained in my academy, instructed how to counter Ottoman tactics. They carry 60.000 florins with Castilian experts and workers to help wall construction and repair. My officials will oversee that the funds are allocated to actual repairs. I can write this order tonight. Assembling this force will take some time, but I can set it in motion. Then, I will sail and visit your city myself to meet with your emperor himself and discuss the options before us. I hope you have had time to think and to make an informed choice. I can discuss what structure we would use should we go to war and other details about our cooperation when I meet with the emperor himself. There are many questions, i know. Will the help and cooperation reduce our independance? What about our culture? These matters will be discussed later when there is time and you have had time to think what you want. Only with the emperor can I definitively settle these matters. My aid gives us this time. What do you think?"

Eight months watching how this Council operates. A single reform decree on clerical pluralism—something everyone agrees needs reform—took four months from proposal to passage. Four months of deputation meetings, procedural arguments, jurisdictional disputes. To address the general congregation, you must first petition the papal legate—yes, Cardinal Cesarini. But he cannot simply grant permission. The four deputations must agree. Each deputation must vote internally. The French will ask why a king with papal backing should address their Council. The radicals will suspect you've come to undermine their authority. And the Hussites, Your Majesty? You wish to speak with men who have fought off five papal crusades? You have just completed a crusade with papal blessing. You carry relics given by a Pope. Why should they trust you? What assurance do they have that you won't denounce them as heretics the moment you leave their presence? I do not say these meetings are impossible. But 'a few days'?

A king with papal backing, fresh from crusade, arrives in Basel and immediately circumvents the Council's authority to make his own declarations? The radical conciliarists will see exactly what they fear—a papal agent undermining their legitimacy. Cardinal Aleman's faction will use your words as proof that Rome sends agents to subvert them. And Cardinal Cesarini... Your Majesty, I saw what you saw this morning. I heard his weeping in that chapel. I spoke with him three times over eight months. The man carries the weight of preventing schism on his shoulders, and that weight is crushing him. To request an audience now, when he is in such fragile state, when you have only just arrived and already speak of declarations and meetings with every faction... I fear this appears not as humble seeking of guidance, but as a king who wishes to reshape the Council to his purposes. And perhaps—forgive me, Your Majesty—perhaps I fear what I see in your eagerness. You came here speaking of spiritual uncertainty, of dark nights of the soul. Yet within hours you plan meetings with Hussites, French, Germans, Italians, personal declarations... Is this the measured wisdom of a king seeking God's path? Or is it the impatience of a man who believes his vision must be imposed quickly before doubt can take root? I will remain by your side. I will help with your confession work.

Three days of prayer, reflection, examination of conscience. Not as obligation to be endured while planning diplomacy, but as genuine spiritual foundation. Every morning at the cathedral. Every evening in reflection. You came here speaking of dark nights and lost paths. Find them first. Everything else flows from that. Second, you must understand that you are not the actor here. Your delegation—myself, Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena, the others—we have been here eight months. We have built relationships. We understand the currents. We know who trusts whom, who fears what. If diplomacy is to be conducted, let us conduct it in your name. You are the King of Castile. Kings do not petition for meetings. Kings do not chase down delegations. Your representatives do this. Third, listen before speaking. Attend the general congregation as observer. Sit quietly. Watch the deputations debate. See how the French argue, how the Germans respond, how the Italians maneuver. Learn the rhythm of this place before you try to change its tune. A week of observation would teach you more than a hundred meetings. Fourth—and hear me well—abandon this notion of personal declarations. If you have commitments to announce, let your delegation present them formally through proper Council channels. 'King Juan II of Castile has committed one thousand knights to Constantinople's defense.' Let them say it. In proper session. Through proper procedure. This honors the Council's authority while still making your position known. Finally, regarding Cesarini and the other leaders—if meetings are to happen, let them come to you. You are a king who has completed the Reconquista. You do not need to seek audiences. When word spreads of what you told the Byzantines today—and it will spread—others will seek you out. Let them come. Receive them graciously. Listen to their concerns. Ask questions. Make no promises, no declarations, no grand pronouncements. This is the course of humility, Your Majesty. This is how a wise king conducts diplomacy—through patience, through representatives, through listening. Not through eagerness and personal intervention. Does this counsel sit well with you?

A single candle flickers before the saint's image, casting dancing shadows on the stone walls. The noise of the departing Council delegates fades to nothing here. He kneels on the cold stone. No cushion. The discomfort feels right somehow. What if I am wrong? The question he brought to Basel, the weight on his soul. But he has been asking it about the wrong things. He thought he was asking: What if my reforms are wrong? What if my plans fail? No. The deeper question: What if my certainty that I must act is itself the wrong? The saddler's words echo: The arrogance is not in wanting to help. The arrogance is in thinking you must help whether they want it or not. And: Letting go. Very hard thing. Juan's hands clasp tighter on the prayer rail. He has completed the Reconquista. He has returned relics to Rome. He has committed a thousand knights to Constantinople. And still—still—he arrives in Basel for one day and believes he must reshape the Church's constitution. Why? Because he cannot bear the thought of it tearing itself apart while he watches. Because he sees the problem clearly and cannot accept that he might not be the solution. Because letting go feels like failure, like abandoning his duty, like cowardice. But what if letting go is the hardest courage of all? The candle flickers. Saint Barbara gazes down with painted serenity. She who was martyred by her own father rather than renounce her faith. She did not try to fix the world. She simply held to what was true and let God handle the rest. Make your own saddles well first. Everything else comes from that. Juan prays.

The eager energy, the impatience to act—they are muted. In their place sits something quieter. Perhaps genuine reflection. Perhaps exhaustion. Perhaps both. Hernando settles into a chair across from Juan, his Franciscan robes rustling. He does not speak immediately, waiting instead to let the King set the tone.

You speak of letting go, of accepting that the Church may tear itself apart. These are profound realizations.

Tell me plainly, Your Majesty. What happened this afternoon that brought you to this place? Not the words you think I want to hear. Not the theological language of humility. Tell me the truth of it. What did you see or hear or feel that changed you? And more importantly—how will you remain changed when the morning comes and the world presses its demands upon you again?

I find great comfort in this and I hope you share this as well. Even if it exposes my sins. This midday, I walked around the city by myself and struck up a conversation with an old saddle maker. He commented on how the council had spent months discussing with nothing to show for it while he had made more than forty saddles. I commented that I would like very much to \"fix their saddle as well\", and we continued this comparison. He made the distinction that he would never walk into a noble man's home and comment that his saddle is wrong and that he must fix it. A comment that struck home very clearly. It is not my task to change the church, and even if I did have exactlly the right reform, no one would listen or even accept it. I must let go.

This... this sounds true to me. More true than theological language would. You say this is a constant struggle. Yes. This is wisdom. You say insights do not guard you forever. Also wisdom. You admit you do not know what to do next. More wisdom still. All of this is good, Your Majesty. All of this suggests genuine reflection occurred today. But I must speak plainly. You have had insights before. After the Infantes' rebellion, you spoke of humility. After Father Tomás refused you absolution, you wrestled with your soul. Each time, genuine struggle. Each time, real growth. And each time... Each time, Your Majesty, the world presented new opportunities, and the old patterns returned. Not because you are evil or insincere.

And I will give you a task—not to contemplate grand theological questions, but something simple. Concrete. Tomorrow, you will attend the Council session as observer only. You will sit in the back, as you did today. You will watch. You will listen. And when your mind begins to say 'I could fix this' or 'If only they would hear my proposal'—and it will say these things, Your Majesty—you will note it. You will write it down. Every time. Every impulse to act, to speak, to fix. You will bring me this list tomorrow evening. This is how we test whether the insight of the afternoon can survive the morning. Not by your words tonight, but by your actions tomorrow. Can you watch the Church struggle and not intervene? Can you let go in practice, not merely in principle? This is not punishment, Your Majesty. This is medicine. The soul, like the body, heals through discipline and practice, not through single moments of understanding. You say you want to let go. Show me. Show yourself. Show God. Will you accept this task?"

Not because God told you so directly, but because your past successes proved you were reading His will correctly. The action that followed from this thought? You stopped asking 'Lord, what do You want of me?' and began declaring 'Lord, I will accomplish this next thing for You.' You moved from servant awaiting instruction to general planning campaigns.

You ask 'what can I do?' and answer yourself that only God can move hearts. You speak of placing faith in trust and guarding against presumption. All of this is... humble. True. But sometimes, is action not required? When the Church bleeds from corruption—when bishops hold ten benefices while their flocks starve, when simony rules in Rome, when the faithful cry out for reform—is it enough to guard against presumption? Or does God require us to act, even imperfectly, even presumptuously? I do not know you, Spanish lord. But I see you struggle honestly with these questions.

Three of their proposals have been incorporated into Council decrees. But here is the thing, my Spanish friend. Your delegation proposes reforms, and this is good. But they dance around the central question. They seek middle ground where no middle ground exists. You say we should focus on what unites us—fighting corruption. Yes, agreed. But how do we fight it? This is where we divide. If the Pope can veto any reform the Council passes, what good are our decrees? If Eugenius can dissolve this Council tomorrow—as he tried to do!—then our work means nothing. The Castilians say 'let both authorities claim credit for reform.' Clever. Diplomatic. But it avoids the question: when Pope and Council disagree, who decides? If we pass decree against simony and Pope says no, what then? We go home with our principles intact and Rome continues as before? You ask what a noble can do. I say: a noble with influence can speak the truth. Can say clearly: the Council of the faithful, guided by Holy Spirit, must have authority to reform the Church—even over papal objection.

But you ask... what if my certainty is itself the problem? What if in fighting for the Church's soul, we destroy its body? I do not agree with you, Spanish lord. I cannot. To compromise with what I see as tyranny feels like... like betraying everything I have fought for. Like telling God that His truth is not worth the struggle. And yet. You say we are supposed to be on opposite sides, but here we kneel together. You say you would be in communion with me under the same roof. And I think... is this not what we claim to want? Unity in Christ? But how do we have unity when we disagree on fundamental questions of authority? I do not know, my friend. I came here this morning certain. You have made me... less certain. I do not know if this is gift or curse. You invite me to pray with you. To finish together as brothers in Christ despite our differences. This is... this is beautiful thing you offer. And part of me wants to accept—to kneel here and simply be two men before God, not conciliarist and papalist, not French and Spanish. But I fear, my Spanish friend. I fear that if I pray with you in spirit of compromise and letting go, I betray everything I have fought for. I fear that your words, however sincere, are the voice of... what is the word... of accommodation with evil. That I will wake tomorrow softer, less willing to fight, and the corruption will continue because men like me chose peace over truth. And yet I also fear that my certainty is the presumption you prayed about. That I have become so convinced of my rightness that I cannot see my own sin. What do we do with such fears? How do we know which voice is God's and which is our own pride?"

I struggle a lot also with making a distinction between god's voice and my own. But as we talk about the church and as it should be, let me offer you my perspective. I agree like almost everyone that reform is needed and great to hear that we have made progress. But the larger matter seems to be who is in charge. I understand the idea of a large congregation deciding things on behalf of the church. But I have also seen the benefits of one figurehead, the pope, moving christendom and the entire church in one direction. Can both exist? I mean - I gesture to the council - they take years to come to any decision. Not perfect either one should think."

You say we take years to decide anything. Yes. True. Frustrating, maddening even. But do you know what the Pope decided in one day? To dissolve this Council entirely. One man, one decision—'these gathered bishops trouble me, so they are dismissed.' Is this the efficiency you admire? Pope Eugenius tried to end us with a stroke of his pen. Only because Emperor Sigismund threatened to withdraw support did he relent. One man nearly destroyed the only hope for reform because it inconvenienced him. This is your figurehead moving Christendom in one direction. You speak of benefits of papal leadership. I speak of decades of simony, of benefices sold to highest bidder, of bishops who have never seen their flocks, of corruption so deep it rots the Church from within. The Pope has had centuries to reform these evils. What has he done? Nothing. Because reform threatens his power. But when the Council—the gathered faithful guided by Holy Spirit—passes decrees against pluralism, against simony, against concubinage, suddenly reform is possible. Why? Because we answer to Christ and Scripture, not to Roman politics. You ask if both can exist. I ask you: when father and children disagree on what is right, who decides? If father says 'we will steal from neighbors' and children say 'this is sin'—do we compromise? Do we steal only a little? No. The father who leads into sin must be corrected by the faithful who know better. This is not about power, my Spanish friend. This is about truth. The Pope is not infallible. He is man, capable of sin, capable of error. The gathered Council, praying and discerning together, is more likely to find God's will than one man surrounded by corrupt advisors in Rome. But I understand your concern. We are slow. We fight amongst ourselves. Perhaps this is our weakness. Perhaps God tests us to see if we can govern ourselves better than one tyrant governs us. I do not know if we will pass this test. You Castilians sit in the middle, proposing compromises. I do not hate you for it. But I believe you are wrong.

You say they do not need your help. Is this acceptance or resignation? You say you felt helpless. Is this surrender to God's sovereignty, or wounded pride that your gifts were not wanted? There is a difference, Your Majesty, between a man who lays down his sword because he trusts God to fight the battle, and a man who throws down his sword in frustration because the battle is harder than he expected.

Many at this Council have forgotten that corruption is the enemy, not the Pope himself. And the radicals have made the Pope the enemy, which blinds them to how their own methods perpetuate the very diseases they claim to cure. Your honesty about wounded pride pleases me, Your Majesty. A man who cannot admit when his pride is stung cannot guard against it. You feel the wound—good. That means you still have conscience enough to recognize it. But I must caution you about something. This notion that doing nothing when witnessing sin is itself sin—it is true, in its proper application. But it can also become the door through which presumption re-enters. 'I must act because doing nothing is sin' can sound very much like humility while being its opposite. The question is not whether you can help, but whether you are called to help in the way you imagine. A physician who sees a sick man is obligated to offer aid. But if the sick man refuses treatment, the physician's duty is discharged. He does not force medicine down the patient's throat and call it virtue. Your meeting with Cardinal Cesarini tomorrow—tell me. What do you intend to do in that meeting? Not what you hope will come of it. What specific actions will you take?"

You sit here now, humbled by a day of watching men argue, fresh from prayer with a struggling bishop, your pride honestly stung. Of course humility comes naturally in this moment. The test comes tomorrow morning, Your Majesty. When Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini—President of this Council, the Pope's own legate who walks the razor's edge between schism and unity—sits across from you and asks: 'What does the King of Castile, who conquered Granada and bears the Pope's decree, think we should do?' When a man of such authority looks to you for answers. When you feel that familiar surge of 'I know what must be done.' Can you maintain this openness then? This willingness to ask his position first? This acceptance that your opinion matters less than you think? I do not doubt your sincerity tonight. I doubt whether tonight's sincerity survives tomorrow's opportunity. You say you have no prepared speech. Good. You say you are prepared to do nothing. Also good. But uncertainty is not the same as humility, Your Majesty. A man who does not know what to do may appear humble, but his heart may simply be confused.

You noticed your own language drifting toward placing yourself at the center, and you brought it to me for examination. This is spiritual maturity. So let us examine it together. You say you are happy and relieved that 'we can save the Church.' Already better language than 'I will reform the Church.' But then you say 'Cesarini has put me at the fulcrum.' What does that reveal? I think it reveals something true and something dangerous living together. The true part: You do have a significant role to play. Papal decree, moral authority from Granada, fresh perspective, willingness to bridge factions—these are real. Cesarini clearly sees value in your involvement. That is not pride, that is reality. The dangerous part: Your natural drift is toward seeing yourself as the key piece. The fulcrum—the point on which everything else turns. Not 'one person among many working together,' but 'the person around whom the solution revolves.' You caught yourself before saying it fully, which is good. But the fact that you drifted there... Your Majesty, I think you carry a burden many men in power carry: the belief that if you are not central, nothing will get done. That if you do not make things happen, they will not happen. This comes from real experience—you have made things happen. Granada fell because you led. But this truth can become spiritual poison when it makes you believe you must always be the one making things happen. So here is my question, and I ask it not to condemn but to help you see: When you imagine this reform effort succeeding, what do you see? Do you see many people working together with you as one among them? Or do you see yourself as the central figure with others supporting your efforts? Be honest.
