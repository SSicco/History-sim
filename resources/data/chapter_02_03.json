They have been here for months, and the Council has given them nothing but theological debates about the Filioque clause and the nature of the Holy Spirit's procession. They are desperate, Your Majesty. And desperation makes men both grateful and suspicious. They remember 1204. They remember that the last time Latin armies came to 'help' Constantinople, those armies sacked the city and established a Latin emperor on the Byzantine throne.

The French delegation would cheer if Eugenius were deposed tomorrow. If you stand before this assembly and proclaim papal supremacy, you will not convince them.

They want their reforms recognized. They are willing to compromise on some matters. But the Church property question is not theological for them—it is political. Bohemian nobles seized those lands. Those nobles now hold power in Bohemia. Any settlement that demands property return means those nobles lose power, which means civil war in Bohemia, which means the moderates here cannot deliver what they promise. You speak of ending heresy and preventing theft. Noble goals. But ending heresy requires Bohemian cooperation, and preventing theft requires Bohemian nobles to surrender their gains.

But when you stand before Cardinal Cesarini and the assembled fathers and claim to speak for Rome, they will ask: by what authority?

If the Utraquists return to Prague with terms that say 'you have your communion, but you must return the lands,' those nobles will reject the settlement entirely. The moderates will be discredited.

In Castile, I command about 5,000 soldiers from three orders who can set sail immediately should this be required. I have entered into an alliance with Aragon who will soon secure Naples. This gives me naval bases and a large fleet. I must confer with them but I have every expectation they will commit. I have founded an academy of Christian military commanders to come up with new tactics to fight the Ottomans. They have already educated officers and can provide doctrine for the army facing the Ottomans in the field. I myself will lead from the front like I did in Granada. I will not ask a man to do something I am not willing to do myself. I have faith that I can rally more kingdoms to come to your aid, especially when there is hope for victory. Hungary and Poland seemed eager to help. A brother in need...you do not ask what he offers you in return when he is about to drown. You just help. I have but one request.

He might withdraw, regroup, wait for better opportunity. But if you mean 'can the Byzantine Empire return to its former strength'—no. That empire is gone.

But a permanent military order? Knights who hold lands in Constantinople, who answer to their Order's Master rather than the Emperor, who maintain Latin rites in an Orthodox city? This is... complicated. We remember the Latin Empire. When the Fourth Crusade conquered us, they established a Latin Patriarch. Latin knights held Greek lands.

It buys us time for you, for the Byzantine Empire, to make a choice. A choice about their future. The first choice is keep doing what we are doing right now. I support you and we delay the inevitable. We fight and die honourably in the defence of Christendom in the east. There is honour and simplicity in this, but the Empire would simply end. If we want to prevent this, far far more is needed. The second choice is migration. I offer every citizen of the empire refuge in my lands. An enormous operation, but together we can build and expand existing cities where your culture can bloom and blossom. not an empire of your own but living as respected brothers in my kingdom where we can honour God side by side. The third choice is the most ambitious and the most uncertain. We fight. We fight and we drive them from the continent completely. I am prepared to, but this will be extremely difficult. And if the empire does indeed wish this, it will be extremely dependant on Castilian aid and military security. It will require extraordinary effort on my part and on that of my kingdom. If we should decide to fight beyond the aid already given, I am only willing to give it if there is an actual chance of victory. I will regard this ask and cry for help for what it is: 'Help us please, for we cannot save ourselves.' I would have to think about what this would even look like, but I would require complete control and authority over the entire campaign. And the Byzantines themselves would be prepared as well to fight for their very survival as well. I hope you can see that from my perspective, these are the only best choices before us. And please understand that I do not want to extract things from you when your backs are against the wall. This is what I propose we do: I will instruct an expedition to be formed of 1000 of my best and most zealous order members. They will be led by officers trained in my academy, instructed how to counter Ottoman tactics. They carry 60.000 florins with Castilian experts and workers to help wall construction and repair. My officials will oversee that the funds are allocated to actual repairs. I can write this order tonight. Assembling this force will take some time, but I can set it in motion. Then, I will sail and visit your city myself to meet with your emperor himself and discuss the options before us. I hope you have had time to think and to make an informed choice. I can discuss what structure we would use should we go to war and other details about our cooperation when I meet with the emperor himself. There are many questions, i know. Will the help and cooperation reduce our independance? What about our culture? These matters will be discussed later when there is time and you have had time to think what you want. Only with the emperor can I definitively settle these matters. My aid gives us this time. What do you think?"

He insists on unified command if they choose war, acknowledging the mortal risks involved. The metropolitans are moved by his honesty about potential failure and death, finding him trustworthy precisely because he doesn't promise easy victory. They agree to advocate for him with Emperor John VIII, and Juan learns about the childless, exhausted emperor who faces impossible choices. The discussion concludes with plans for immediate aid and Juan's future personal journey to Constantinople after his wife gives birth."
