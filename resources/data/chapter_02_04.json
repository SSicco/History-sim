Metropolitan Bessarion remains seated, his scholarly face reflecting careful thought. Beside him, Isidore's gruffer expression has softened—not entirely, for the wounds of Western betrayals run deep—but something has shifted behind those weary eyes. Don Bernat de Centelles stands near the window, the Aragonese ambassador's expression unreadable. He has witnessed much in his years serving King Alfonso, but a Castilian king offering to bleed his kingdom dry for Constantinople's sake—this is something new."

Have them shipped out as soon as possible. Another letter for the two Greeks here. A personal letter from me to the emperor, stating that I look forward to seeing him and will visit when my wife has delivered. Explain that I have discussed three opssible options for us to proceed and would like to discuss these with him in person. I hope the help offered is recieved in the spirit it was given and expect no reward or concession in return. What will you do now? Will you return to Constantinople now you have secured my aid?

What you propose—meeting with all these delegations, securing permission to address the full Council, all within days—this is not how Basel functions. I have been here eight months, Your Majesty. Eight months watching how this Council operates. A single reform decree on clerical pluralism—something everyone agrees needs reform—took four months from proposal to passage. Four months of deputation meetings, procedural arguments, jurisdictional disputes. To address the general congregation, you must first petition the papal legate—yes, Cardinal Cesarini. But he cannot simply grant permission. The four deputations must agree. Each deputation must vote internally. The French will ask why a king with papal backing should address their Council. The radicals will suspect you've come to undermine their authority. And the Hussites, Your Majesty? You wish to speak with men who have fought off five papal crusades? You have just completed a crusade with papal blessing. You carry relics given by a Pope. Why should they trust you? What assurance do they have that you won't denounce them as heretics the moment you leave their presence? I do not say these meetings are impossible. But 'a few days'? Your Majesty, securing an audience with the Hussite delegation alone could take a week of negotiations. They are careful men, suspicious of Latin princes. And rightly so."

You have been here one day. One day. And already you speak of making public pronouncements that bypass the assembled fathers of Christendom? How will this appear? A king with papal backing, fresh from crusade, arrives in Basel and immediately circumvents the Council's authority to make his own declarations? The radical conciliarists will see exactly what they fear—a papal agent undermining their legitimacy. Cardinal Aleman's faction will use your words as proof that Rome sends agents to subvert them. And Cardinal Cesarini... Your Majesty, I saw what you saw this morning. I heard his weeping in that chapel. I spoke with him three times over eight months. The man carries the weight of preventing schism on his shoulders, and that weight is crushing him. To request an audience now, when he is in such fragile state, when you have only just arrived and already speak of declarations and meetings with every faction... I fear this appears not as humble seeking of guidance, but as a king who wishes to reshape the Council to his purposes. And perhaps—forgive me, Your Majesty—perhaps I fear what I see in your eagerness. You came here speaking of spiritual uncertainty, of dark nights of the soul. Yet within hours you plan meetings with Hussites, French, Germans, Italians, personal declarations... Is this the measured wisdom of a king seeking God's path? Or is it the impatience of a man who believes his vision must be imposed quickly before doubt can take root? I will remain by your side. I will help with your confession work. But I cannot in good conscience help arrange meetings or declarations that may do more harm than good—to this Council, to your mission, and perhaps to your soul."

Three days of prayer, reflection, examination of conscience. Not as obligation to be endured while planning diplomacy, but as genuine spiritual foundation. Every morning at the cathedral. Every evening in reflection. You came here speaking of dark nights and lost paths. Find them first. Everything else flows from that. Second, you must understand that you are not the actor here. Your delegation—myself, Bishop Alfonso de Cartagena, the others—we have been here eight months. We have built relationships. We understand the currents. We know who trusts whom, who fears what. If diplomacy is to be conducted, let us conduct it in your name. You are the King of Castile. Kings do not petition for meetings. Kings do not chase down delegations. Your representatives do this. Third, listen before speaking. Attend the general congregation as observer. Sit quietly. Watch the deputations debate. See how the French argue, how the Germans respond, how the Italians maneuver. Learn the rhythm of this place before you try to change its tune. A week of observation would teach you more than a hundred meetings. Fourth—and hear me well—abandon this notion of personal declarations. If you have commitments to announce, let your delegation present them formally through proper Council channels. 'King Juan II of Castile has committed one thousand knights to Constantinople's defense.' Let them say it. In proper session. Through proper procedure. This honors the Council's authority while still making your position known. Finally, regarding Cesarini and the other leaders—if meetings are to happen, let them come to you. You are a king who has completed the Reconquista. You do not need to seek audiences. When word spreads of what you told the Byzantines today—and it will spread—others will seek you out. Let them come. Receive them graciously. Listen to their concerns. Ask questions. Make no promises, no declarations, no grand pronouncements. This is the course of humility, Your Majesty. This is how a wise king conducts diplomacy—through patience, through representatives, through listening. Not through eagerness and personal intervention. Does this counsel sit well with you? Or does it feel too slow, too cautious for what your heart desires?"

A single candle flickers before the saint's image, casting dancing shadows on the stone walls. The noise of the departing Council delegates fades to nothing here. He kneels on the cold stone. No cushion. The discomfort feels right somehow. What if I am wrong? The question he brought to Basel, the weight on his soul. But he has been asking it about the wrong things. He thought he was asking: What if my reforms are wrong? What if my plans fail? No. The deeper question: What if my certainty that I must act is itself the wrong? The saddler's words echo: The arrogance is not in wanting to help. The arrogance is in thinking you must help whether they want it or not. And: Letting go. Very hard thing. Juan's hands clasp tighter on the prayer rail. He has completed the Reconquista. He has returned relics to Rome. He has committed a thousand knights to Constantinople. And still—still—he arrives in Basel for one day and believes he must reshape the Church's constitution. Why? Because he cannot bear the thought of it tearing itself apart while he watches. Because he sees the problem clearly and cannot accept that he might not be the solution. Because letting go feels like failure, like abandoning his duty, like cowardice. But what if letting go is the hardest courage of all? The candle flickers. Saint Barbara gazes down with painted serenity. She who was martyred by her own father rather than renounce her faith. She did not try to fix the world. She simply held to what was true and let God handle the rest. Make your own saddles well first. Everything else comes from that. Juan prays.

The eager energy, the impatience to act—they are muted. In their place sits something quieter. Perhaps genuine reflection. Perhaps exhaustion. Perhaps both. Hernando settles into a chair across from Juan, his Franciscan robes rustling. He does not speak immediately, waiting instead to let the King set the tone.

He made the distinction that he would never walk into a noble man's home and comment that his saddle is wrong and that he must fix it. A comment that struck home very clearly. It is not my task to change the church, and even if I did have exactlly the right reform, no one would listen or even accept it. I must let go. And my own drive for pushing for this reform I recognized for the precieved divine guidance and over confidence you have warned me about. I still do not know exactly what to do and I fully realize that wanting to change the world is potentially very dangerous."

I appreciate your honesty, Your Majesty. And I note that you do not claim grand revelation or divine vision. You speak of a conversation with a craftsman, a simple analogy that struck home. This... this sounds true to me. More true than theological language would. You say this is a constant struggle. Yes. This is wisdom. You say insights do not guard you forever. Also wisdom. You admit you do not know what to do next. More wisdom still. All of this is good, Your Majesty. All of this suggests genuine reflection occurred today. But I must speak plainly. You have had insights before. After the Infantes' rebellion, you spoke of humility. After Father Tomás refused you absolution, you wrestled with your soul. Each time, genuine struggle. Each time, real growth. And each time... Each time, Your Majesty, the world presented new opportunities, and the old patterns returned. Not because you are evil or insincere. But because, as you say, the flesh is weak. So here is what I propose. Not absolution tonight. Not yet. Tomorrow you will complete your second day of reflection. And I will give you a task—not to contemplate grand theological questions, but something simple. Concrete. Tomorrow, you will attend the Council session as observer only. You will sit in the back, as you did today. You will watch. You will listen. And when your mind begins to say 'I could fix this' or 'If only they would hear my proposal'—and it will say these things, Your Majesty—you will note it. You will write it down. Every time. Every impulse to act, to speak, to fix. You will bring me this list tomorrow evening. This is how we test whether the insight of the afternoon can survive the morning. Not by your words tonight, but by your actions tomorrow. Can you watch the Church struggle and not intervene? Can you let go in practice, not merely in principle? This is not punishment, Your Majesty. This is medicine. The soul, like the body, heals through discipline and practice, not through single moments of understanding. You say you want to let go.

Three of their proposals have been incorporated into Council decrees. But here is the thing, my Spanish friend. Your delegation proposes reforms, and this is good. But they dance around the central question. They seek middle ground where no middle ground exists. You say we should focus on what unites us—fighting corruption. Yes, agreed. But how do we fight it? This is where we divide. If the Pope can veto any reform the Council passes, what good are our decrees? If Eugenius can dissolve this Council tomorrow—as he tried to do!—then our work means nothing. The Castilians say 'let both authorities claim credit for reform.' Clever. Diplomatic. But it avoids the question: when Pope and Council disagree, who decides? If we pass decree against simony and Pope says no, what then? We go home with our principles intact and Rome continues as before? You ask what a noble can do. I say: a noble with influence can speak the truth. Can say clearly: the Council of the faithful, guided by Holy Spirit, must have authority to reform the Church—even over papal objection.

And I would rather have a church that is imperfect but functional, than a church that is always fighting itself to the death. Sometimes the most graceful thing to do is to compromise and to let go. I mean, look at us. Are we not supposed to be on opposite sides in this struggle? But I would gladly be in communion with you under the same roof in the same church. I do not have an answer and genuinely do not know what to do. But until I do can we together finish our prayer while in the same church? That would bring joy to my heart and hopefully the lord's as well."

You say you would compromise with papal overreach to prevent greater evil. That you would rather have imperfect church than one fighting itself to death. Eight months I have been here. Eight months arguing, debating, fighting for what I believe is right. And every day I grow more certain that I am right—that the Council must have supremacy, that Rome's corruption must be broken, that we must act decisively or the Church dies. But you ask... what if my certainty is itself the problem? What if in fighting for the Church's soul, we destroy its body? I do not agree with you, Spanish lord. I cannot. To compromise with what I see as tyranny feels like... like betraying everything I have fought for. Like telling God that His truth is not worth the struggle. And yet. You say we are supposed to be on opposite sides, but here we kneel together. You say you would be in communion with me under the same roof. And I think... is this not what we claim to want? Unity in Christ? But how do we have unity when we disagree on fundamental questions of authority? I do not know, my friend. I came here this morning certain. You have made me... less certain. I do not know if this is gift or curse. You invite me to pray with you. To finish together as brothers in Christ despite our differences. This is... this is beautiful thing you offer. And part of me wants to accept—to kneel here and simply be two men before God, not conciliarist and papalist, not French and Spanish. But I fear, my Spanish friend. I fear that if I pray with you in spirit of compromise and letting go, I betray everything I have fought for. I fear that your words, however sincere, are the voice of... what is the word... of accommodation with evil. That I will wake tomorrow softer, less willing to fight, and the corruption will continue because men like me chose peace over truth. And yet I also fear that my certainty is the presumption you prayed about. That I have become so convinced of my rightness that I cannot see my own sin. What do we do with such fears? How do we know which voice is God's and which is our own pride?"

I struggle a lot also with making a distinction between god's voice and my own. But as we talk about the church and as it should be, let me offer you my perspective. I agree like almost everyone that reform is needed and great to hear that we have made progress. But the larger matter seems to be who is in charge. I understand the idea of a large congregation deciding things on behalf of the church. But I have also seen the benefits of one figurehead, the pope, moving christendom and the entire church in one direction. Can both exist? I mean - I gesture to the council - they take years to come to any decision. Not perfect either one should think."

You say we take years to decide anything. Yes. True. Frustrating, maddening even. But do you know what the Pope decided in one day? To dissolve this Council entirely. One man, one decision—'these gathered bishops trouble me, so they are dismissed.' Is this the efficiency you admire? Pope Eugenius tried to end us with a stroke of his pen. Only because Emperor Sigismund threatened to withdraw support did he relent. One man nearly destroyed the only hope for reform because it inconvenienced him. This is your figurehead moving Christendom in one direction. You speak of benefits of papal leadership. I speak of decades of simony, of benefices sold to highest bidder, of bishops who have never seen their flocks, of corruption so deep it rots the Church from within. The Pope has had centuries to reform these evils. What has he done? Nothing. Because reform threatens his power. But when the Council—the gathered faithful guided by Holy Spirit—passes decrees against pluralism, against simony, against concubinage, suddenly reform is possible. Why? Because we answer to Christ and Scripture, not to Roman politics. You ask if both can exist. I ask you: when father and children disagree on what is right, who decides? If father says 'we will steal from neighbors' and children say 'this is sin'—do we compromise? Do we steal only a little? No. The father who leads into sin must be corrected by the faithful who know better. This is not about power, my Spanish friend. This is about truth. The Pope is not infallible. He is man, capable of sin, capable of error. The gathered Council, praying and discerning together, is more likely to find God's will than one man surrounded by corrupt advisors in Rome. But I understand your concern. We are slow. We fight amongst ourselves. Perhaps this is our weakness. Perhaps God tests us to see if we can govern ourselves better than one tyrant governs us. I do not know if we will pass this test. You Castilians sit in the middle, proposing compromises. I do not hate you for it. But I believe you are wrong.

Eight months later, I have watched the same arguments repeat endlessly. The same factions entrench deeper. The same fears drive men to extremes.
