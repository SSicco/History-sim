      "recap": "Juan proposes the parallel legislation strategy for the crusade call: Pope and Council should agree on identical text beforehand so both can enact it simultaneously, giving the crusade complete legitimacy without either authority submitting to the other. Cesarini and the German cardinals immediately grasp the strategic brilliance, seeing the crusade call as a perfect test case for Pope-Council cooperation. Bessarion calls it a breakthrough that could enable cooperation on other matters. Juan also requests a copy of the Council's electoral reform decree to review and later discuss with the Pope. Cesarini estimates the Council process will take six to eight weeks minimum but commits to beginning informal conversations immediately."

In the quarters, Fray Hernando has left the copied reform decree on the desk -- twenty-three pages of detailed Latin text about electoral procedures for cathedral benefices."

The Council debates endlessly and passes nothing of substance regarding the Constantinople crusade. Pope Eugenius will ultimately have to act alone."

Despite the passionate breakthrough in the chapter house meeting, Cardinal Louis Aleman's French radical faction systematically blocks the decree in the four-deputation system, turning every discussion into a proxy battle over papal versus conciliar supremacy. The German delegation's genuine commitment is insufficient to overcome Basel's structural paralysis. The Council passes nothing regarding Constantinople, and Pope Eugenius will have to issue his crusade call unilaterally. Juan's concrete commitment of 1,000 knights and 60,000 florins stands alone as Castile's independent action."
